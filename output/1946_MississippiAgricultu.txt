Some Implications of Land Tenure in the 
Longleaf Pine Area of Mississippi 

By 

D. Gray Miley 



This study is part of a Regional Land Tenure Research Project 
which was organized for the purpose of studying land tenure prob- 
lems in an area covering five states. The interest in and the import- 
ance of land tenure in this area is due to the high percentage of 
tenancy in each state. In Mississippi for example, 66 percent of the 
farms operated in 1940 were operated by tenants. The percentage 
of tenants was much higher for negroes (85 percent) than for whites 
(43 percen). (See tables 1 and 2). It is recognized that the particular

forms of tenancy and perhaps many of the problems will be different 
^ in the various states comprising the area. However, it was hoped 
that by studying these problems over a wide area it might be possible 
to arrive at a more workable classification of tenants as well as some

of the basic principles involved in the division of the rights in land. 

For the Regional study, samples were taken in the areas of each 
state that were thought to be representative of larger regions. The 
area in Mississippi was selected to represent the Coastal Plains region. 
The counties selected for study are in the Longleaf Pine type-of-farm- 
ing area and for this reason, in the Mississippi study, these counties 
were considered to be representative of this area; for the Regional 
study, they will be considered as representative of the Coastal Plains 
region. 

Marion and Jefferson Davis counties were considered to be 
representative of the Longleaf Pine area. In these counties 20 dif- 
ferent neighborhoods were selected for intensive study. These 20 
neighborhoods give a representative picture of farming and tenure 
conditions as they exist in these counties. As nearly as possible, all 
of the farmers in each of these neighborhoods were visited and infor- 
mation obtained on a farm and family schedule. Complete informa- 
tion was obtained on the operations of the farm as well as the tenure 
status of the farmers and other conditions pertaining to the family 
and its participation in community affairs. In fact, every bit of in- 
formation that it was thought might be helpful in an analysis of the 
entire farm and tenure status of these families was obtained. 

For the Mississippi study, a total of 327 schedules was obtained ; 
the information on the operations of the farms was for the crop year 
1942. ( See table 3) . These schedules were all edited and the informa- 
tion coded on punched cards in the Regional office of the Land Tenure 
Research Project at Fayetteville, Arkansas. Tabulations of this ma- 
terial have been made in the Regional office and made available to 
workers in the individual states.

iThe tenure status of 9 farmers is indeterminate. These are omitted in this 
table, and will usually be omitted hereafter. 

In Mississippi, a considerable number of other tabulations have 
been made to go along with those furnished by the Regional office. 
This report is based on the information obtained from the Regional 
office as well as tabulations made in the State from data obtained in 
the two Mississippi counties. Each of the other states plans to issue 
reports on the work done in their state and, in addition, a regional 
report or reports will be issued in which the results of the work done 
in all of the states will be summarized and analyzed. The main ob- 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 3 

jective in the Mississippi portion of this study is to show the physical 
and human resources of each of the tenure classes and to determine 
the use that each class is making of its resources. The main emphasis 
was placed on the economic side of the entire operation. An attempt 
was made to determine the producing ability of the several tenure 
groups and to show how the production, and in turn the economic 
well-being of these families might be improved. Many other factors 
such as the participation of the family in community affairs, the level 
of education, the stability of the farm family, and other important 
factors were taken into account in an effort to fully explain the situa- 
tions studied. 

Historical Development' 

The Longleaf Pine area is made up of 11 counties in the south 
central part of the State of Mississippi. (See figure 1). As the name 
implies, this area was formerly covered with longleaf pine forests. 
The importance and value of these forest resources were not realized 
until many years after the area was settled. In fact, to the early 
settlers, the large longleaf pines were considered to be more of a 
liability than an asset. With the equipment available at the time the 
first settlers came into the area, it was a difficult job to clear the 
land of the virgin trees so that it could be cultivated. 

Both Marion and Jefferson Davis Counties were originally a 
part of Washington County which was established in 1800. This 
county was in what was at that time the Southeast corner of the 
newly organized Mississippi territory. At the time this county was 
established, much of the territory was still owned and occupied by the 
Choctaw Indians. After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, attempts 
were made to establish land routes from this new territory to New 
Orleans and to Natchez. The establishment of these routes made it 
necessary to acquire some of the Choctaw land. In 1805, the United 
States Government purchased around 4,000,000 acres of land in 
Southern Mississippi for the sum of $55,500. This was known as 
the first Choctaw Cession and both Marion and Jefferson Davis 
Counties have been created from lands included in this first purchase. 

Marion County was created in 1811 and was named for General 
Francis Marion, the noted ''swamp fox" of Revolutionary War days. 
Most of the early settlements of the Mississippi territory was con- 
centrated along the southern border and the city of Columbia had its 
beginning as the center of trade for this new settlement. As the 
population of the State of Mississippi increased and as new counties 
were created, the size of Marion County steadily decreased. Much 
of the original area had been taken away when a part of the county 
was used in 1890 in the creation of Pearl River County. Other por- 
tions of the county were taken in 1904 and 1914 to form other sur- 
rounding counties. 



iMaterials in secticttis on Historical Development, Farm Marketing Op- 
portunities, Farm Credit Facilities, and Opportunities for Off-Farm Employment, 
were summarized largely from field notes taken by Raleigh Barlow, of the Regional 
staff.

Jefferson Davis County has a short history as a county because 
it was not created until 1906 when it was formed from parts of 
Covington and Lawrence Counties. 

The first permanent settlers came into this area around 1800. 
Some of the old homes that are still standing were built between 1795 
and about 1810. The surveying of the area and the opening up of 
the land for settlement around 1811 and 1812 together with the lo- 
cation of the Jackson Military Road in 1815 helped to bring in a large 
number of settlers. 

By 1820, Marion County with twice its present area had a popula- 
tion of 3,116. After 1820, however, the population increased very 
slowly and it was not until 60 years later, in 1880, that the population 
had doubled itself . (See table 4). 

Much of the land in this area was bought from 1:he government at 
public auction by settlers at the minimum rate of $1.25 per acre. 
However, as was the case in many other areas, a considerable portion 
of the .land in Southern Mississippi was bought by speculators. By

the time the Homestead Act became applicable soon after its passage 
in 1862, there seems to have been little unpatented land left in the 
area. 

A large proportion of these early settlers came from North and 
South Carolina. For the most part, they located their farms along 
the Pearl River or the smaller streams of the area. As mentioned 
earlier, the process of clearing the land was usually slow but the better 
fixed of the settlers were able to establish plantations which they op- 
erated with a few slaves. 

It was not until shortly before the War Between the States that 
cotton became an important crop commercially in this area. Diffi- 



6 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



culties of transportation made it almost impossible to get cotton to the 
ports for exportation. The principal crops grown were corn, rice, 
sweetpotatoes, and garden vegetables. The major sources of income 
were from cattle, sheep, wool, and timber. However, about the time 
of the War Between the States, steamboats began to navigate Pearl 
River and with this development along with the importance of New 
Orleans as a cotton market, this crop became the most important 
source of income for the entire area. 

South Central Mississippi did not feel the direct effects of the 
War Between the States in the same way as did many other sections 
of the South. Many of the local sons took part in the war but no 
battles were fought in the vicinity of either of the counties studied. 
However, the entire area suffered from the economic and social dis- 
locations that came after the war. Some of the negroes stayed with 
their former masters and became sharecroppers, but as was the case 
in other areas throughout the South, many of the planters were bank- 
rupt by high taxes and 4 years of warfare and the farms of several 
of these were divided into smaller farms. Even though this was 
never an area of large plantations, many of the farmers had a few 
slaves. The problem of how to handle these emancipated slaves was 
similar to those faced by other areas throughout the South. Many 
of the negroes wanted to become farm owners but lacked the necessary 
capital as well as managerial ability to operate the farms. Other 
negroes were willing to work for wages but the landlords were fre- 
quently not able to pay even the small amount of wages that was 
demanded. 

Under these circumstances, the sharecropping system along with 
the furnish system gradually developed in this area. However, the 
sharecropping system as it now exists, probably did not come into 
existance overnight. The principle of the working agreement be- 
tween the landlord and the tenant was developed rather soon after 
the close of the War Between the States and the emancipation of the 
slaves. However, the terms of the agreement by which the ov^er 
and the sharecropper divide the proceeds of the crop have varied 
from time to time. The almost universal practice that has come 
to be accepted is for the sharecropper who furnished all the labor but 
no equipment to get half the crop, and the sharecropper who furnishes 
the labor and equipment to get two-thirds of the cotton and three- 
fourths of the corn. In each case the other shares go to the land- 
lords for furnishing the land and probably some seed and fertilizer. 

As was indicated earlier, the growth of population was relatively 
slow between 1820 and 1880. In 1880 only about two percent of 
the land in Marion County was cleared and improved. The progress 
made since that time is closely associated with the great timber boom 
that started in Southern Mississippi about that time. The value of 
the pine forests was finally realized and a land boom resulted from 
speculators attempting to gain control of the standing forests. Some 
of the land passed into the hands of residents of the county but the 
greater portion was bought by Northern capitalists. Previous to this

time only a small lumber industry had existed in Marion County 
to supply the local needs. 

The commercial sawmill business did not really get started until 
after 1890 and the real growth came after the building of the first 
railroads into this area between 1900 and 1906. As the lumber in- 
dustry boomed, the population increased. A large number of saw- 
mills were located along the railroads in both counties. Many of the 
larger mills built short spur logging lines that connected with the 
main lines of the railroads. These large lumbermen worked with 
dozens of smaller timber operators and often employed hundreds of 
men. Some of these larger operators cut over pine land at the rate 
of 20 to 30 acres a day and their operations left vast areas of cut 
over land. 

As the lumber operators moved on, much of this land was cleared

and put into cultivation. (See table 5) The percentage of the total.land 
area in farms in Marion County increased from 33.7 in 1890, to 58.7 in 
1940. The increase in cropland in this area has been greater in 
recent years than in any other area of the State. Along with this 
increase, the size of the average farm decreased from 165 acres in 
1890, to 66 acres in 1940. The number of farm operators in the two 
sample counties has increased steadily. (See table 6). The number of 
full owners in Jefferson Davis County increased only slightly between 
1920 and 1940 ; whereas the total number of tenants almost doubled 
during this period, thus accounting for most of the increase in the 
number of farm operators. On the other hand, the number of full 
owners in Marion County increased 47 percent between 1920 and 1940 
and, in addition, the number of tenants doubled during this period. 
(See table 7). 

Complete information on the number of sharecroppers by census 
years is not available but the available information indicates that the 
number of croppers has increased about the same proportion as the 
number of tenants. Jefferson Davis County has consistently had 
the highest percentage of tenancy, but tenancy has steadily increased 
in Marion County as more land has been cleared for farming. 

The boom years for the lumber industry came to an end during 
the 1920's. In other words, it took 20 to 30 years for the lumber

interests to cut out the virgin timber in this area. The big operators 
finished cutting out their holding and most of the large as well as 
the small operators closed down their mills and moved out or turned 
to some other form of business, while their logging and sawmill crews 
were scattered to other areas or settled down as farmers on the lands 
they had helped to clear. Sawmills and lumber processing plants 
are still important industries in the area, but the large-scale opera- 
tions involving the cutting and processing of the virgin longleaf 
yellow pine are now a thing of the past. 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 9 



Many of the towns and cities of South Mississippi were born 
of and grew out of sawmill operations and many of these once pros- 
perous municipalities are now becoming ghost towns. The city of 
Columbia with its 4,000 inhabitants confronted this bleak industrial 
future around 1928 when the largest lumber company in the area faced 
the possibility of closing down and throwing its 800 employees out 
of work. However, under the leadership of a number of citizens, 
several industries have been established in Columbia that give em- 
ployment to more people than were formerly employed by the lumber 
company. A knitting mill, a vegetable canning plant, a large gar- 
ment factory, a pickle plant, a naval stores plant along with several 
other small industries are now located in and around the city of 
Columbia. 

Because of the fact that a large proportion of the land in this 
area was not cleared of timber until about 20 to 35 years ago, many 
of the farms as well as the settlers are fairly new when compared 
with other agricultural areas of the State. This type of development 
has led to a fairly large number of small owner-operated farms. 
Many of the former employees of the sawmills bought small tracts of 
the cut over land and settled down to farm. This pattern of develop- 
ment gives in this area a group of the descendants of the old settlers 
that came into the area around 100 years before the timber boom got 
under way along side of those who came into the area and settled 
on the cut over land. 

The negro population declined during the War Between the 
States but most of the freed slaves stayed in the area after the close 
of the war. It is interesting to know that many of these negroes were 
able to acquire land and in some instances have built solid neighbor- 
hoods of colored negro owners. In a few cases, there are neighbor- 
hoods where there are both white and negro owners. Other negroes 
became sharecroppers and farm wage hands and in many other cases 
they were able to secure employment in the sawmills and with logging 
crews. As mentioned earlier, this has never been a typical planta- 
tion area. Rather it is an area where there are some communities 
in which farms of the plantation type prevail. These are usually 
the old communities. However, along with these there are other 
communities where small individually owned and operated farms 
prevail. In the old plantation-type communities, some of the planters 
use white tenants and croppers while in some cases whites and negroes 
are used on the same farm. On the larger farms, however, there 
seems to be a distinct preference for colored sharecroppers. The 
reason for this preference may be found in the fact that negroes are 
usually less resentful of supervision, they are usually less inclined to 
complain, and in many instances their demands for housing are less 
than those of white croppers. 

Problems of race conflict exist in Southern Mississippi just as 
they exist in practically every other area where negroes and whites 
associate on a comparatively equal economic footing. The enumera- 
tors in this study observed very few cases in which these conflicts 
were allowed to get out of control. In the solid white and solid negro 
operator neighborhoods, a considerable amount of friendliness, mutual 



10 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



respect, and willingness to cooperate in the operations of the other 
race were encountered. Friction is usually found in mixed neigh- 
borhoods, particularly in cases where white operators work as tenants 
or croppers alongside negroes. The feelings of the white man on 
the race question are more apt to become aroused if his colored neigh- 
bor is able to achieve a higher economic status. Where negroes and 
whites operate in the same community on fairly equal terms as opera- 
tors or as tenants, there is always considerable opportunity for con- 
flicts of interest to develop as a result of competition and often of 
jealousy. 

Farm Marketing Opportunities 

The availability of marketing opportunities has a close relation- 
ship to the conditions determining land tenure status but this relation- 
ship is exerted indirectly rather than directly. Many factors both 
physical and economic have their influence upon the combination of 
enterprises to be used in any area or on any individual farm. The 
principal economic factors involved are marketing opportunities, 
transportation facilities, and the use of capital and credit. 

Marketing outlets together with the necessary transportation 
facilities are very important factors influencing the choices between 
competing enterprises and it is through these choices that the tenure 
status is often determined. Marketing opportunities act to provide 
or deprive the farmer of alternative enterprises that he can choose 
between when he selects the particular combination of crop and 
livestock enterprises that he will use. From this particular combina- 
tion of farm enterprises and the proportioning of the factors of pro- 
duction between them, the farmer gets his annual income. The 
amount of this income determines in a very large measure whether 
the farmer will be in position to acquire farm real estate and farm 
capital. 

Since marketing opportunities influence the enterprise pattern 
and consequently the level of his income, they exert a very important 
indirect influence on the tenure status. Ordinarily, crops are not 
raised commercially in any area until the markets and transportation 
facilities necessary for handling the crops are developed. An excel- 
lent example of this is given in the history of Marion and Jefferson 
Davis Counties where cotton has been the main cash crop for many 
years. The lack of marketing opportunities for other crop and live- 
stock enterprises has been a major determining factor in continuing 
cotton as the only important cash crop. 

The tenure changes that can come with changes in marketing 
opportunities usually come slowly as new markets are realized. There 
is probably very little prospect that the cotton economy in this area 
will be disrupted by the introduction of new enterprises but the more 
complete utilization of the soil and the labor available depend upon 
the introduction of other enterprises that do not have to compete 
directly with cotton. However, the successful introduction of many 
new enterprises depends upon the successful establishment of market- 
ing opportunities. 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 11 



In those cases where new crop or livestock enterprises together 
with market outlets can be introduced, there are opportunities for 
bringing about changes in the tenure status of many of the operators 
through increasing the farm income. As is well known, the cotton 
crop calls for high labor requirements during relatively short periods 
of the year and the farmers success is determined very largely by the 
prices that he gets for his cotton crop. In many cases, it might be 
possible for him to improve his tenure status by supplementing his 
cotton enterprise with other crop or livestock enterprises that will 
more fully utilize the farm labor. However, changes of this kind 
usually proceed rather slowly because farmers are reluctant to change 
from crops that they know how to grow and which are fairly sure 
to bring in an income to new enterprises that they know very little 
about. 

In the area studied, the facilities for handling the cotton crop 
are adequate. There are marketing and processing facilities within 
fairly reasonable distances to all the farms in the two counties. 
Practically every farm in the two counties studied grows cotton and 
all farmers can find a ready market for their cotton as soon as it is 
ginned if they care to sell it at that time. 

In addition to facilities for handling cotton, some marketing 
facilities are available for other enterprises. Grading stations for 
Irish potatoes are located at the main shipping points in Marion 
County. Columbia has a fairly well developed Irish potato market. 
The vegetable canning plant at Columbia also offers a ready market 
for such crops as snap beans, spinach, turnip greens, crowder peas, 
pimiento peppers and svv^eetpotatoes. The production of these 
specialty crops is found on a much larger proportion of owner 
operated farms than on tenant farms. In fact, practically all of the 
farm operators receiving high incomes from truck crops are owners. 

From a consideration of the 1942 crop values and farm net worth, 
there is very little indication that the addition of these specialty crops 
has had much effect upon tenure status. The farm owner who raised 
these specialty crops seemed to be only slightly better off than the 
average for the two counties. However, the study of these farms 
during this one year does not provide sufficient information on which 
to justify the conclusion that there is no relationship between the 
use of these new marketing opportunities and tenure status. In 
order to have conclusive information on this point, it would be neces- 
sary to study the tenure process over a period of time. 

The production of livestock in this area is found almost entirely 
on owner operated farms. The tenant or cropper always stands at 
a disadvantage compared to the owner vv^hen it comes to participating 
in livestock enterprises. The tenure system developed for cotton 
and long practiced in this area, does not fit in with a livestock 
economy. Under such a system, it is practically impossible for 
sharecroppers to have the advantage of the use of livestock enter- 
prises of any kind. Such a situation raises the question of whether 
or not sharecroppers can make any constructive use of the opportuni- 
ties furnished by additional marketing facilities. 



12 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



In conclusion it can be said that, in general, the sharecropper or 
tenant is at a disadvantage as compared with the owner when it 
comes to making decisions about the use of new marketing oppor- 
tunities. In this respect, tenure status can be said to have as much 
or more influence upon the use of marketing facilities as the use of 
these facilities has upon the determination of tenure status. In other 
words, the establishment of new marketing opportunities does not 
enable the tenant or sharecropper to advance himself along the agri- 
cultural ladder unless the tenure system under which he operates is 
such that he can change his combination of enterprises so as to take 
advantage of the added opportunities. Apparently from such infor- 
mation as is available from the studies made in these counties, the 
small owners, sharecroppers, and tenants have not been in position to 
take full advantage of the opportunities offered by additional mar- 
kets for truck crops, Irish potatoes, or livestock and livestock pro- 
ducts. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that, for the 
most part, these enterprises are found on owner-operated farms and 
are less prevalent in those communities that have a plantation system. 

Farm Credit Facilities 

The availability and use of farm credit constitutes one of the 
more important factors in the determination of the tenure status 
of any particular farm operator. Credit problems are not new in the 
South: as a matter of fact, many historians have stressed the role 
played by credit in binding the planters of the old South to a com- 
mercial one-crop type of agriculture. The furnish system grew out 
of the disturbed conditions that followed the War Between the States. 
The problems of the South including the need for industrialization as 
well as many of the agricultural problems, are partly attributable to 
the lack of capital and the reliance of the South upon the importation 
of capital from other areas. 

The nature of the credit facilities available to the farmers of 
any given area and the use made of these facilities has a definite 
effect upon the conditions of land tenure. Regardless of how tenure 
status is measured, the position of any particular individual in the 
scale bears a direct relationship to the availability and use of farm 
credit. In many instances, the use of credit facilities is one import- 
ant factor that determines whether or not a farmer will be able to 
climb the agricultural ladder. Unless a farmer is able to progress to 
the point where he can have a capital investment in equipment, live- 
stock, land, buildings, or supplies, he can do little more than remain 
on the lowest rungs of the agricultural ladder. The farmers who 
are able to ascend the ladder accumulate larger and larger amounts 
of capital and this increased investment represents a fund of "stored 
up" and "saved" labor. 

Some farmers are fortunate enough to acquire capital invest- 
ments as a result of good luck, inheritance, or gift. For many others, 
however, the climb up the agricultural ladder is a slow process that 
requires a lot of hard work and savings to accumulate enough capital 
to make the next step. 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 13 



In many cases, the farmer finds it more advantageous to make 
use of farm credit facilities as he advances or holds his tenure status,. 
In fact, in many cases, the availability of the credit of the proper 
kind and in the right amounts is a determining facor in the tenure 
process. As would be expected, the farmer with the greatest amount 
of ability is naturally in a position to make the best use of credit but 
the farmers in all tenure classes use credit. 

The sharecropper requires advances of furnish credit to take 
care of his needs through the crop season. If he were not in position 
to get this type of credit, very likely he would be forced to offer his 
services as a day laborer. After a good year an ambitious cropper 
might invest his savings in a mule and some equipment and thus 
enable himself to climb to the status of a "third and fourth" renter. 
In order to maintain his position, he may have to borrow money on 
chattels and his crop to provide himself with production and con- 
sumption credit needed while he awaits the harvest of his crop. 
Other farmers in other cases use credit in the purchasing of new 
tractors and the acquisition of real estate, in financing feed programs 
for livestock or in many other ways to increase the size of their 
present enterprise or to add entirely new enterprises to their opera- 
tion. 

The problems of advancing to the status of farm ownership are 
becoming more complex all the time. Formerly land was plentiful 
and could be had at a very low price, but as land values continue to 
increase and good land becomes scarcer, the farmer who desires to 
own his own place has found it necessary to use more capital in his 
purchase transaction. In many areas in order to become an owner 
without the use of credit requires that a farmer accumulate his 
savings for nearly his entire lifetime before he has enough to buy 
a farm. The other alternative is to buy a farm with the use of 
credit that will supplement a cash down payment. Except in cases 
where young farmers acquire their farms by inheritance or gift or 
rare cases of wind-fall profits, it is almost impossible for young 
people who wish to enter farming to acquire a farm of their own 
without the use of credit. 

In summary it can be generally stated that the availability and 
use of farm credit facilities often have a strategic influence on farm 
tenure status. This is particularly true in the South where the 
deficit supply of farm capital relative to factors of land and labor 
has been one of the major contributing factors to the low^ production 
of agricultural laborers and consequently, low farm incomes. One 
does not have to look far to see evidences of the lack of capital and 
the need for more adequate buildings, fences, livestock, machinery, 
soil and other farm improvements. 

Along with the lack of adequate capital has been many cases 
of high costs of the available credit. The furnish system has often 
resulted in high interest rates which, though often justified, have 
resulted in hardships to those families who had to depend on this 
system. These interest payments, though small, in many cases rep- 
resented the margin of income that might be used in a gradual ac- 



14 mSSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



cumulation of capital. It should be pointed out that in most cases 
these interest charges were justified on a basis of the risk involved. 
The main fault seems to lie with the system itself in that it tends to 
create conditions that make it very difficult for sharecroppers to 
advance themselves along the agricultural ladder and. in addition, 
there are many cases where farmers seem to have gotten into a state 
of economic bondage from which they are often not able to free 
themselves. 

The availability of credit opportunities effect not only the tenure 
status of farm families but in addition, influences nearly all farmers 
in their choices of farm enterprise. The fact that the credit system 
throughout the South has always been and still is, tied to the produc- 
tion of cotton makes it very difficult for farm people to secure 
capital to start new enterprises. 

In the two counties studied in Mississippi, the Federal Land Bank 
was the most important loan agency operating in the real estate 
credit field. Local banks, individuals, and other sources had a few 
real estate loans in 1942 but they were of very minor importance. 
For the most part, these real estate loans were for amounts ranging 
from S250 to $750. Real estate mortgage credit in these counties 
has been available from government sponsored agencies, banks, lum- 
ber companies, and many individuals. 

Examination of the records of tracts of land purchased since 
1927 indicates that all of these sources were used in some of the 
sample communities. There is evidence that this type of credit has 
been available in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of farm 
people in these counties. There may be some question about the 
quality of credit available. This factor applies particularly in cases 
of farmers who want to expand their operations to include new enter- 
prises. Entrance into the livestock industry, for example, requires 
considerable initial investment in land, pasture development, build- 
ings, and the livestock itself. In many of the strictly cotton areas, 
credit of this type on terms adapted to these new enterprises has not 
been readily available. From the standpoint of the credit agency, 
this is undesirable because they feel that the risks involved in new 
enterprises of this type are greater than they are for enterprises such 
as cotton where a long credit history is available. However, from 
the standpoint of a more balanced agriculture, and a fuller employ- 
ment of the natural and human resources, the lack of such credit is 
often a seriously limiting factor. 

Production or non-real estate credit has been available from 
landlords and merchants, local banks. Farm Security Administration, 
production credit associations, and emergency feed and seed loans. 
The use of merchant or furnish credit is much more prevalent in 
Marion than in Jefferson Davis County. Several large furnish mer- 
chants in Marion County have expanded their operations to include, 
in addition to furnishing credit, the marketing of crops involved. By 
providing these additional services, they have apparently been able 
to meet the competition of both federally sponsored and private credit 
agencies. On the other hand, in Jefferson Davis County, the use of 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MIS SISSIPPI 15 

credit from the Farm Security Administration, individuals and other 
agencies, is much more common than in Marion County. 

As in the case of real estate credit, the general availability of 
production credit seems to be adequate to meet the needs of most 
individuals in these two counties. However, the quality of the credit 
available may not be suited to the needs of many of the individuals. 
For example, a study of the information available indicates that prac- 
tically all of the croppers deal either with their landlords or with 
credit merchants for the funds they use. In most cases, the credit 
standing of the cropper does not permit him to get credit from any 
other agency and consequently, his credit choices are limited to 
agencies that charge high rates for the money furnished. Thus 
farmers who had accumulated enough capital to be renters were 
somewhat better off in so far as the fund from which they could 
supply their credit needs was somewhat larger. In spite of this 
fact, however, most of the renters depend upon landlord or merchant 
credit. 

The facilities offered by the Farm Security Administration 
seems to be the only ones giving these old line credit sources any 
serious competition. When looked at as a group, the owner operators 
use several types of credit facilities but a large proportion of the 
owners in the sample studied use merchant or Farm Security Admin- 
istration credit. Further examination of this showed that the smaller, 
less prosperous farms made the greatest use of merchant credit. 
The operators who had less than $1,000 equity in their farm busi- 
nesses, for the most part, used merchant credit in Marion County and 
Farm Security Administration credit in Jefferson Davis County. 
The farmers with equities of over $3,000 in their farm business made 
a much greater use of bank and government credit, and usually the 
only use they made of merchant credit was in the purchase of fer- 
tilizer. 

Opportunities for Off-Farm Employment 

Opportunities for off -farm employment during the seasons when 
the available labor is not fully occupied on the farm are of major 
importance in the cotton economy. As has long been recognized, one 
of the major problems of the cotton areas in the South is the relatively 
small amount of the total labor available that is fully used in the 
production of cotton. The large amounts of labor that are required 
in the peak periods of chopping and picking are very often idle for 
the rest of the year. Unless other enterprises are introduced in the 
farm organization that provide fuller employment, the only other 
alternative is for the farm operators to seek off -farm employment or 
remain idle. The availability of off-farm employment is very often 
the determining factor in the change of farm operators from one 
tenure status to another. Ambitious sharecroppers or tenants that 
take advantage of other employment opportunities during the slack 
period of farming are more likely to advance along the agricultural 
ladder than those who simply grow their one crop of cotton and re- 
main idle the rest of the year. 



16 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



The enumerators in the Marion and Jefferson Davis County 
studies observed that in many cases the more prosperous farmers had 
regular off-farm sources of income. The enumerators in the other 
states, particularly Arkansas and Louisiana, observed the same situa- 
tion for the area sampled in their states. This situation naturally 
raises the question of whether or not plans for bettering the land 
tenure conditions in these areas can afford to neglect giving some 
attention to the part that supplementary employment opportunities 
might have upon tenure. The greater the number of alternative 
choices that are available to the farmer and the more desirable these 
alternatives seem to be, the greater will be their effect upon the local 
systems of farming and the existing ratios between the population 
and the available land. In this connection the employment oppor- 
tunities that the farmer can dove-tail into his regular farm working 
program are of particular importance. This alternative is very im- 
portant because it makes it possible for the farmer in Southern Mis- 
sissippi to supplement his regular farm income with certain off -farm 
receipts. 

The present farming system in Southern Mississippi favors the 
balancing of the farm program with some off -farm work. As will 
be shown in some detail later, the average farmer places major re- 
liance upon the cultivation of cotton and corn and this combination 
of crop enterprises seldom requires the presence of the farmer on 
his farm for more than 6 to 8 months during the year. 

The diversification of his farming system by the addition of other 
crops such as Irish potatoes and sweetpotatoes, peanuts and truck 
crops still usually leaves him with the winter season free for some 
other type of employment. About the only exception to this situation 
is found among those farmers who have the capital, land and pasture 
available for adding a livestock enterprise to their farm business. 
Along with this availability of the average farmer for off -farm work 
during a portion of the year is the usual condition of low farm in- 
comes that almost always need some supplementing from off-farm 
sources if the farm family is to enjoy anything more than a sub- 
sistence standard of living. In many cases it is possible for this 
additional income to be invested in farming equipment, livestock or 
land and thus improve the tenure status of the individual farmer. 

At the time this study was made in 1942, opportunities available 
to farmers in Southern Mississippi for off-farm employment were 
probably greater than at any other time in the history of the settle- 
ment of Mississippi. The defense and war industries located along 
the Gulf Coast and the army camps in the State offered a consider- 
able demand for employees and it was not difficult for even those 
farmers who possessed no particular skills to secure employment. 
Because of this situation the employment opportunities available at 
the time the study was made cannot be considered as reflecting the 
average or normal conditions. 

During what might be considered as normal or regular times, 
one of the important sources of employment is that of work on other 
farms in the area. Many small owners, sharecroppers, and tenants 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAP PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 17 



find employment as farm wage hands on the larger farms in the area. 
This type of employment was more important in Jefferson Davis than 
in Marion County. In Jefferson Davis County, 45 out of the 89 farm- 
ers for which information was obtained received some income from 
farm work on farms other than their own ; while in Marion County, 
only 42 of the 145 farmers from which information was obtained 
received an income from this type of employment. This situation is 
probably a reflection of the fact that opportunities for other types 
of employment are greater in Marion than they are in Jefferson Davis 
County. 

Another type of employment which has always been important in 
this area is that which is offered by the timber industry. This in- 
dustry provides the local people with an opportunity for both full time 
and part time employment. The Southern Naval Stores Company 
employs around 110 men at its plant in Columbia. In addition, a 
considerable number of men are employed in the stump blasting 
crews which provide the raw material used by this company. Other 
timber industries such as sawmills, pulp mills, and a container cor- 
poration located in Southern Mississippi and Northeast Louisiana 
offer ready markets for timber and timber products. Many farmers 
find part or full time employment in logging crews or other types of 
work in connection with these timber industries. During 1942, 42 
operators in Marion County and 14 farm operators in Jefferson Davis 
County had receipts from work in the timber industry. 

There are several other types of off -farm employment available 
to farmers in these two counties such as work at cotton gins and other 
processing plants, the construction and defense industries, and skilled 
and semi-skilled trades. However, perhaps the other most important 
single opportunity is offered by manufacturing industries in the city 
of Columbia in Marion County. The most important industry in this 
group is the Reliance Manufacturing Company, or garment factory, 
which in normal times employs from 500 to 800 people. A very large 
proportion of the persons employed are women. When this plant was 
first established in Columbia, approximately 85 percent of the workers 
lived on farms in the surrounding area. A rather large proportion 
of the company employees continue to come from farms. These farm 
women and girls come in from their homes to the plant daily, many of 
them coming from as far as 25 miles away from the plant. For the 
most part, they come in car-sharing pools and pay for their trans- 
portation to and from the plant out of their earnings. Usually, they 
work in 8-hour shifts and are guaranteed a minimum wage of 44 cents 
per hour. Within the sample secured, practically all of the women 
working at this plant were wives and daughters of farm owners ; only 
a very small number of those working worked 12 months during the 
year. This suggests that many of the farm women look upon their 
work at the garment plant as temporary and seasonal rather than 
as permanent employment. All of the women working at the garment 
plant are white and, consequently, no opportunities are offered here 
for negro farm families. 

In summary it may be said that these various alternative and sup- 
plementary employment opportunities have been used at one time or 



18 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



another by practically all of the farm families in the area studied. 
This is shown by the fact that 145 of the 187 owners and tenants in 
the Marion County sample and 101 of the 132 owners and tenants 
sampled in Jefferson Davis County reported some earnings from off- 
farm work during 1942. The off -farm workers represented almost 
80 percent of the two respective samples. Further study of the 
sample indicates that the majority of those persons not working off 
their farms during the year were men who were over 55 years of age. 
The importance of these alternative and supplementary sources of 
income cannot be over-emphasized because the sampled area in Mis- 
sissippi is an area of high man-land ratios. It is an area where the 
existing labor supply during the normal year is underemployed and 
where, as a consequence, a low and inefficient productivity per man 
can be tolerated. Where such a situation exists, the serious problems 
of low incomes, small farms together with underemployment, cannot 
be solved by agriculture alone without the migration of workers from 
the sampled areas. However, the introduction of employment oppor- 
tunities that will provide farm people with alternative choices to 
supplement their farm income, can go a long way toward solving 
many of these problems. 

At the present time some of the more serious problems of agri- 
culture in the area can be partially or completely solved either by 
relieving the population pressure on the land so that larger farms can 
be operated by a smaller, more efficient, and more productive labor 
force with a greater reliance upon labor saving machinery, or the 
present small farm setup can be continued with the farmers depending 
on supplementary employment opportunities for a way in which to 
increase their present small farm incomes. Any far reaching plan 
for tenure reform or any other agricultural changes in Southern Mis- 
sissippi should give some attention to the industrial possibilities of 
the area and the role that industries can play in providing farm people 
with alternative and supplementary employment opportunities. 

Even though much of th^'s area is fairly new from an agricultural 
standpoint, there is considerable evidence that the farm population 
is alreadv too laro^e in relation to the land resources for a very large 
average farm income under present methods of farmirg. The human 
resources of the area will be discussed fully in the next section but it 
should be pointed out here that the birth rate in the two sample 
counties is slightly more than double the rate required to maintain 
a stationary population. Unless employment opportunities are pro- 
vided for these additional children as they become of age, it is neces- 
sary for them to remain on farms in the area where they are reared. 
It does not take many generations where each generation produces 
twice the number of children necessary to maintain itself, for the 
total land available in any area to be completely utilized. It is not 
long before the average size farm becomes so small that the average 
farmer cannot possibly make a very high income. Apparently this 
is what has been happening in the areas under consideration. 

Further subdivision of the farms in order to provide for the 
additional children in each generation only adds more to the rather 
acute problem already present. Opportunities for the employment 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 19 



of these people either in industries within the area or opportunities 
for employment outside of the immediate area seem to be absolutely 
essential if some of the pressure of the population on the land re- 
sources is to be removed. This does not mean that there are no op- 
portunities to increase the level of income on the existing farms by 
better practices and the use of machinery. It does mean, however, 
that with the present small size of farm and ordinarily a fairly large 
supply of cheap labor, the opportunities for improvement by these 
methods are limited by a large number of small farms. The introduc- 
tion of labor saving machinery and, in most cases, the introduction 
of new enterprises, particularly livestock enterprises, requires a 
larger farm than the average size found in this area. 

Human Resources 

The Longleaf Pine section of Mississippi is predominantly a 
rural area. For the entire area, there was an average of 39 persons 
per square mile in 1940 compared with an average of 34 persons per 
square mile in 1930. (See table 8). The State of Mississippi had 46 
persons per square mile in 1940 and 42 in 1930. Marion County had 
an average of 44 persons per square mile in 1940, which was an in- 
crease of 8 persons since 1930. Jefferson Davis County also had an 
increase from 34 to 38 persons per square mile between 1930 and 1940. 
In fact, every county in the Longleaf Pine area had an increase during 
this period except Lamar which showed a slight decrease in total 
population.

The Longleaf Pine area had 13 percent of the State's population 
in 1940. In 1930 this area had only 10 percent of the total popula- 
tion of the State. These figures indicate that the population density 
is not quite as great in the Longleaf Pine area as for the remainder 
of the State, but it is significant that the rate of increase during the 
period between 1930 and 1940 was higher in this area than for the 
State as a whole.

In the two sample counties, the farm families studied have an 
average of 4.7 persons in the household. (See table 9). This average 
was the same for both white and negro families. White owner fam- 
ilies averaged having 4.5 persons per household while the white 
sharecropper families had 5.3 persons per household. On the other 
hand, the negro owner families had 4.9 persons per household and

the negro sharecroppers had 4.7 per household. Negro owners had 
a slightly larger number of persons per household than negro share- 
croppers while white owners had somewhat smaller households than 
white sharecroppers. 

At the time the study was made, the white operator families had 
an average of 4.4 persons at home while the negro operator families 
had 4.1 persons at home. (See table 10). Since the number of persons 
per household was the same for these two groups, this indicates that 
the negro households had in them a larger number of persons who 
were not members of the operator's family than the white households.

The fact that there were four persons per family at home for 
the farms included in this study does not mean that the labor force 
available for farm work was this large. When the ages of the 
children were considered along with the fact that farm women are 
not available for full time farm work, the average man equivalent 
units of labor available was 1.7 for each farm. However, this does 
not mean that there was actually this amount of work accomplished, 
but simply that there was this amount of labor available to do farm 
work. 

White owners had an average of 1.6 man equivalent units of 
family labor available and the white renters and sharecroppers had 



LAND TENtFRE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OP MISSISSIPPI 21 



a slightly larger amount of labor available. (See table 11 ) . In the negro 
group, the owner families had an average of 1.8 man equivalent units 
of family labor available while the renter and sharecropper groups 
had somewhat less than this amount. The differences between any 
of the tenure groups are not very large, the greatest difference being 
between the two renter groups. The greatest difference between 
any of the other groups is only 0.2 of one man equivalent. This means 
a difference of one full time man for 2.4 months per year. These 
averages indicate that the labor force available in each of the race 
and tenure groups is about the same. In other words, each group 
has approximately the same amount of labor available to combine 
with the other factors of production.

Only a small number of the heads of families included in thia 
study had as much as a high school education. (See table 12) . Among 
the 129 white owners, 27 had one or two years of high school tra^'ning 
while 15 completed three or four years of high school education. 
Three of the white owners completed one or two years of college work ; 
none were college graduates. Five of the owners did not attend school 
at all, while all of the others had from one to eight grades of grammar

school work. The average white owner completed slightly under 
eight grades of school. 

Only four of the negro owners had any high school work and 
none of these went further than the second year. All the other negro 
owners had from one to eight years of grammar school work, except 
five that did not attend school. The average negro owner completed 
5.4 grades of school. 

In the renter and cropper groups, for both whites and negroes, 
only a small number attended high school and but two were able to 
attend college. The proportion attending high school in these groups 
was greater for the whites than for the negroes. In the negro share- 
cropper group, 44 of a total of 55 did not get beyond the sixth grade. 
The average for the negro sharecropper group was 4.5 grades com- 
pleted. The average negro owner had a little better education than 
the negro sharecropper, the average for this group being 5.4 grades 
completed. White owners also had a better education than white 
sharecroppers. When compared by race, the average white farm 
operator had better educational opportunities than the average negro 
operator. The white operators completed about 8 grades of school 
work while the negro operator completed only 5 grades. 

Farm owners and renters for both white and negro races are 
older than sharecroppers. (See table 13). Twenty of the 29 white share- 
croppers were under 40 years of age while only one was over 60. 
Negro ^arecroppers averaged a little older than the white share- 
croppers but they were considerably younger than the negro owners.

Few of the negro owners could be considered young men while 
a fairly large number of white owners were under 40 years of age. 
This indicates that it is easier for white farmers to move out of the 
sharecropper group at a comparative earlier age than it is for negro 
farmers. Perhaps one of the major contributing factors to the 
ownership of farms by white operators at an early age is the in- 
heritance of property by these younger operators. In the sample 
studied, 12 white farmers under 30 years of age ov^ed their farms 
and a total of 38 farmers under 40 years of age were owners. " 

In the negro group, there was not a single ov^er under 30 and 
only 8 ov^ers under 40 years of age. Apparently inheritance and 
other factors were not working to make owners among the negroes 
to the same degree as for the white farm operators. The fact that 
negroes who own farms acquire them so late in life makes it almost 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 23 



impossible for the children, especially the older ones, to inherit the 
property at an early age. 

Over half of the owners, both negro and white, had been on their 
present farms for more than 10 years. (See table 14). The duration of 
occupancy on the present farm was similar for both white and negro 
owners. Twenty percent of the white owners had been on their 
present farm 3 years or less, while only 12 percent of the negroes 
had been on their farms for this period.

In the sharecropper group, 65.5 percent of the white ^croppers 
had been on their present farms less than 1 year and 90 percent had 
been on their present farms 2 years or less. Consequently, only 10 
percent of the white croppers had been on their present farms as 
long as 3 years. For the negro sharecropper, 31 percent had been 
on their present farms less than 1 year and 64 percent less than 2 
years. Thirty-six percent of the negro sharecroppers had been on the 
same farm for more than 3 years. 

These figures show that white sharecroppers move more fre- 
quently than negro sharecroppers. This is emphasized by the fact 
that almost two-thirds of the white sharecroppers had occupied their 
present farms less than one year, while among the negro sharecrop- 
pers, less than one-third had been on their present farm less than a 
year. This fact may help explain why many landlords show a pre- 
ference for negro sharecroppers. There seems to be a great deal of 
unrest and dissatisfaction among white sharecroppers that causes 
them to move almost every year. It may be that this unrest and 
dissatisfaction with their sharecropper status is one Of the major 
factors causing the white croppers to move into the owner group 
much faster than negroes. On the other hand, the willingness of the 
negro to accept supervision together with his apparent satisfaction in 
a sharecropper status, ordinarily makes him a good risk as a cropper. 

Many negroes seem to prefer to work as sharecroppers on larger 
farms where they have the advantage of farming good land as well 
as have the supervision of a competent landlord. By temperament 
and by tradition, the negro seems to be much better suited for this 



24 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



type of arrangement than the white farmer. As the usual thing, 
the white operator resents having to be supervised by anyone else 
and in addition, there is the feeling that the sharecropper status is 
the domain of the negro and that whites should not be lowered to this 
status. No doubt this feeling accounts in large part for the unrest 
and dissatisfaction among the white cropper group. This is not to 
say that there are no negroes with sufficient ambition and ability to 
want to become independent owners. In fact, as will be shown, some 
negroes do become owners, but on the other hand, some others remain 
sharecroppers their entire lives. 

Of the 58 negro owners studied in 1942, only 34 were owners in 
1932 or 10 years earlier. (See table 15) . The other 24 had entered the 
owner group from other tenure classifications during this 10-year 
period. In 1932 three were part owners, six were renters, nine were 
croppers and the other six were either in non-farm occupations or 
they had not entered farming because they were too young. Thus it 
appears that during this period some of the negroes from all tenure 
classifications were moving upward along the agricultural ladder. On 
the other side of the picture, half of the negroes that were share- 
croppers in 1932 were still sharecroppers in 1942. Nearly all of the 
other sharecroppers had come in from non-farming occupations or 
were young persons who entered farming during this period. Only 
one negro had moved from the owner status to the sharecropper class, 
while three had moved from the renter class to the sharecropper class.

On the other hand, out of 29 white farmers that were share- 
croppers in 1942, only 7 or about one-fourth were croppers in 1932. 
Two white owners and two renters had moved downward to the 
sharecropper class during this period. Almost all of the other white 
croppers had no tenure status in 1932 which means they were young 
persons who had begun farming during this period. 

Among the 133 white farmers who were owners in 1942, 77 
were owners in 1932. During this period, 9 part owners, 13 renters, 
10 croppers, 5 from non-farming occupations, and 15 with no farming 
status in 1932 had become owners. Here again is a definite indica- 
tion that it was possible for a number of farmers in all tenure classes 
to climb the agricultural ladder. Even in the small groups of renters 
for both negro and white farmers, there is a definite indication that 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 25 



most of these operators had moved into the renter class from lower 
tenure classifications during this period. 



Physical Resources 

The well-being of any group of people depends to a very large 
extent upon the amount of physical resources available for their use 
and the way they use these resources. The most important resource 
used by farmers is the land they cultivate. Half of the white owners 
included in this study had less than 40 acres of land in cultivation and 
a total of three-fourths of these farmers had less than 60 acres in 
cultivation. (See table 16). Only about nine percent of the white owner 
farms had more than 100 acres in cultivation. In the negro owner

group, 51 percent had less than 40 acres in cultivation, while 81 per- 
cent had less than 60 acres. Eighty-seven percent of the operators 
in the renter and sharecropper group both white and negro had less 
than 40 acres of land in cultivation. In the negro sharecropper 
group, 22 out of a total of 57 had less than 20 acres of land on which 
to make a living. 

When classified on the basis of the total acres in the farm, the 
distribution shows that many farms have considerable land that is 
not in cultivation. (See table 17). This applies particularly to the own- 
er farms. The land resources available should be given serious con- 
sideration in any plan which is designed to improve the well being of

As would be expected, the largest amount of extra land available 
is on the larger owner operated farms. The 47 farms that were 
operated by white owners with croppers had an average of about 
111 acres of land in woods. These same farms had an average of 70 
acres in cultivation. The 14 farms operated by white owners with 
croppers that had the largest number of acres in cultivation had an 
average of 119 acres of crop land. There were 15 negro owners that 
had croppers. These 15 farms averaged 59 acres of cropland and 
about 53 acres of land in woods. The two largest negro owned farms 
had an average of 98 acres of land in cultivation. These owner farms, 
both white and negro, that were operated with croppers were the 
largest farms included in the sample. Within these two groups, the 
farms that had the largest acreage in cropland also had the largest 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 27 



acreage in open and woods pasture as well as woods not pastured. 

The largest single group in this distribution was the white owner 
family farms. There were 84 farms in this group and they had an 
average of 31.5 acres of cropland. In addition to the land in cuti- 
vation, these farms had an average of 28 acres in woods that were 
pastured and 17 acres in woods that were not pasture. There was an 
average of 4 acres of open pasture on each of these farms. 

The negro owner family farms had 29 acres of cropland and, in 
addition, 22 acres of woods. These negro owner family farms had 
only 2.2 acres of open pasture. White croppers had an average of 
25.5 acres in cropland, 16 acres in woods that were pastured and 1.6 
acres of open pasture. The 58 negro sharecroppers had 25 acres of 
cropland, 2.3 acres of woods pastured, 1.3 acres of woods not pas- 
tured, and only 0.7 of an acre in pasture. This table bears out the 
statement made earlier that, for the most part, croppers have very 
little land at their disposal other than that which is used for the pro- 
duction of row crops. When all groups of owners and croppers are 
combined, 66 percent or about two-thirds of these farm operators have 
less than 40 acres of cropland. About 27 percent have between 40 
and 80 acres of cropland and only 7 percent over 80 acres of land in 
cultivation. 

Sharecroppers, renters and one-family farm owners have about 
6 acres of cropland per person at home. (See table 19). The cropland 
per person in the owner groups includes only the members of the 
owner families and not those of the sharecropper families that are 
also living on the land. Consequently, the average of 10.7 acres of 
cropland per person at home in the white owner families and 8.8 
acres per person for the negro owner families would be reduced if all 
the persons who are dependent on the land for a living were included. 
Indications are that the ratio of people to cropland in this area is 
about 1 to 6. In other words, there are about 6 acres of cropland for 
each person on farms in the area. This compares with a 1940 ratio 
of 1 to 5 for the State of Mississippi and 1 to 10.5 for the United

States. The average farm person in Mississippi and the area studied 
has only about one-half as many crop acres from which to make 
his farm income as the average farm person in the United States. 
When compared with certain states the disadvantage for Mississippi 
farmers is even greater. For example, in 1940, the ratio in Illinois 



28 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



was 1 to 18.7 and in Iowa it was 1 to 21.6. In other words, the 
average farm person in these states had access to from three to four 
times as much cropland as the average farm person in the Longleaf 
Pine area of Mississippi. 

Another factor that is of importance in determining the produc- 
tion and income of any group of farm people is the amount and quality 
of equipment and machinery used. In 1942, 38 percent of the white 
farm owners had less than $100 worth of farm implements and ma- 
chinery and about 60 percent had less than $150 invested in equip- 
ment. (See table 20). Only 7 out of 135 white owners had as much as 
$500 worth of farm machinery and equipment. None of the negroes 
had as much as $500 invested in equipment and three-fourths of them 
had less than $150 worth. Nearly all of the renters had less than 
$150 invested in implements and machinery and all of the sharecrop- 
pers had less than $50 worth of equipment. For the sharecroppers, 
this means the amount of equipment they owned themselves.

The sharecropper system provides that the landlord furnish the 
necessary machinery and equipment for the use of the sharecropper. 
Under these conditions, it is not necessary for them to o^vn a great 
deal of equipment. 

The size and type of machinery and equipment available de- 
termines to a very large extent the total amount that a farmer can 
produce. For the most part farmers in the Longleaf Pine area used 
half -row equipment. (See table 21). This is true for the smaller one- 
family farms as well as for the larger farms that have two or more 
families. Only three tractors were found on the 327 farms studied. 
The main items of equipment used in the production of crops were 
turning plows, middlebusters, straight or Georgia stocks, some kind 
of harrow and a planter. Practically all of these were one-horse 
items of the type that has been in use since the area was settled. 
The larger farms with two or more families used the same type of 
equipment in the production of crops as the smaller farms. Ap- 
parently the usual practice is to add another compliment of one-horse 
equipment to the farm as it becomes large enough for the addition of 
another unit. Therefore, where tenants are kept, the landlord furn- 
ishes each tenant with the one-horse equipment necessary to handle

the land he is to operate. From the standpoint of power and equip- 
ment used in production, the tenant operated farms are in reality 
two or more one-horse farms operated under one management. 

A larger percentage of farms with tenants had cars, trucks, wa- k 
gons, fertilizer distributors, stalk cutters and haying equipment than ^ 
the smaller one-family farms. The major advantage of the tenant 
operated farms as compared to the smaller owner operated farms 
seemed to be that a larger percentage of them had these larger items 
of equipment. For example, 54 percent of the white operators who 
had tenants and mowing machines and 40 percent had hay rakes 
while only 13 percent of the one-family white operators had mowers 
and only 9 percent had hay rakes. 

The 26 negroes who owned one-family farms had an average of I 
$98 invested in all farm machinery and equipment. The items most I 
commonly found on these farms were a wagon, a turning plow, a " 
middlebuster, a straight stock, and a harrow. Only 38 percent had 
a planter and only 3 percent had a cultivator. Usually only one piece 
of each item of equipment was found and these were almost always 
the one-horse half -row type. 

The 79 white one-family farms had an average of $188 worth of 4 
farm machinery and equipment. These farms had the same items 
as listed above for negro farms and in addition, a few had a disk, 
a planter, a stalk cutter, a fertilizer distributor and a mower. One 
farmer out of the 79 had a tractor while 30 percent had some type of 
truck or automobile. Six farmers out of this group had cultivators 
that were valued at $30 each which suggests that they are two-horse 
cultivators of the one-row type. All the other equipment is the single- 
horse half -row type found generally throughout the area. 

There were 13 negro farm owners in the group studied that had 
one or more tenants. These owners with tenants had $250 invested 
in farm machinery and equipment. Thirty-one percent of this group 
had a car or truck, but none had a tractor. For the most common 
items of equipment, the only difference between these and the one- 
family farms is that the farms with tenants have two or more sets 
of one-horse equipment. Two of these negro operators had cutiva- 
tors, two had fertilizer distributors and two had stalk cutters. 

The 37 white operators that had tenants had $480 invested in 
farm machinery and equipment. Around 60 percent of these opera- 
tors had either a truck or an automobile, but only two had tractors. 
The usual items of equipment were the same in this group as for the 
others, the only difference being that there was a set of equipment 
for each tenant. In addition to this regular equipment, at least a 
fourth of these operators had fertilizer distributors, stalk cutters, 
mowing machines and hay rakes. 

The total value of the farm business' is another index of the 
amount of resources available for each family. In 1942, 56 percent 
of the white owner farms had a total farm business valuation of less 
than $3,000. (See table 22). In the negro owner group, 68 percent had 
a total farm business of less than $3,000. Only two of the renters 
and sharecropper operators had a farm business valued at more than 



i 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 31 



$3,000. The lowest valuation was found in the negro sharecropper 
group where all except three had a total farm business valuation 
of less than $1,500.

iThe value of farm business is the value of the real estate used plus the ending 
inventory value of livestock and equipment. 



When grouped on the basis of the 1942 valuation of the farms 
occupied, 73 percent of the white owner farms were valued at less 
than $3,000 while 81 percent of the farms occupied by negro owners 
had a valuation less than this amount. (See table 23). All farms occupi- 
ed by negro sharecroppers had a valuation of less than $2,000 and 
nearly all farms occupied by white sharecroppers fell in this same 
group. It is readily seen from these data that the value of the farm 
occupied as well as the total value of the farm business was low for all 
groups of farms, both white and negro.

The value of livestock owned, including workstock, was higher 
for the white owner farms than for any other group. (See table 24). 
About 62 percent of the white owners had over $400 worth of live- 
stock per farm. This means of course, that about 38 percent of the 
white owners had less than $400 invested in livestock, including work- 
stock. On the other hand, 38 percent of the negro owners had over 
$400 worth of livestock while 62 percent had less than this amount. 
In the sharecropper groups for both white and negro, all had less 
than $200 invested in livestock. When the value of workstock is

removed from the tabulation, it is shown that practically all produc- 
tive livestock is found on the owner operated farms. (See table 25). In 
the negro sharecropper group, 48 out of a total of 58 had less than 
$100 worth of productive livestock. Only one farm in this group 
had over $200 invested in livestock.. The situation is practically the 
same for white sharecroppers. Some of the renters in both white 
and negro groups had a little productive livestock but not as much as 
is found in the owner group. This situation bears out an observa-

tion made earlier in this report that it is very difficult under the 
present tenure system for sharecroppers to handle any large amount 
of productive livestock. The fact that they have only 30 to 40 acres 
of land at their disposal makes it imperative that they use practically 
all of it in cultivated crops. It is almost impossible to establish 
successful livestock enterprises on small farms such as those found 
in this area. This applies to nearly all sharecroppers and renters and 
to a large proportion of the farm owners in both negro and white 
groups. 

Use of Land Resources 

The major proportion of the cropland is devoted to the produc- 
tion of cotton and feed-grain crops on all farms studied in this area. 
(See able 26). The 47 white farmers who had croppers, planed on the 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 33 



average about 18 acres in cotton. Within this group, the acres plant- 
ed in cotton ranged from 4.5 for those farms with less than 20 acres 
of cropland to 29 acres for the farms with over 80 acres of cropland. 
These same farms had an average of 32.5 acres in feed-grain crops. 
These larger farms had an average of 5 acres in garden and truck 
crops and 7 acres in hay and forage crops. In every case, the larger 
farms in the group had the largest average acreage for each crop or 
group of crops. 

Negro owners that used sharecroppers had an average of 16 
acres of cotton and 28 acres of feed-grain crops. These negro owners 
also devoted some of their cropland acres to truck and garden crops, 
hay and forage crops, and annual rotation pasture. The average 
acreage devoted to each of these was a little smaller than for the 
white owners who had sharecroppers. 

White owner family farms had an average of 8 acres in cotton and

13 acres in feed-grain crops. As was the case with the other groups, 
the larger the amount of cropland available, the larger was the acre- 
age devoted to garden and truck crops. 

Negro owner family farms had an average of 7.8 acres of cotton 
and 13.6 acres in feed-grain crops. This was almost the same acreage 
devoted to these crops as was planted to the same crops on the white 
owner family farms. The negro owners in this group also planted 
small acreages to garden-truck and hay-forage crops. For both the 
white and negro sharecropper groups, the acreages planted to cotton 
and feed-grain crops were very nearly the same. It is interesting to 
note also that the acreages planted to these crops by croppers were 
almost the same as for the owners in both the white and negro family 
groups. In other words, as far as the major crops are concerned, 
the sharecroppers have the same acreage from which to draw an in- 
come as the owners of family farms. The sharecroppers have very 
little acreage devoted to hay-forage crops and only a small amount 
planted to garden-truck crops. 

The only difference between the crop organization of the share- 
cropper farms and the small owner farms is the slightly larger amount 
of land planted to garden-truck, hay-forage, and annual rotation pas- 
ture on the small owner farms. These additional acreages probably 
make it possible for these small owners to produce sufficient vege- 
tables, meat, milk and poultry products for their own use while on the 
cropper farms the acreage is hardly sufficient for this purpose. 

On both the small owner and sharecropper farms, the acreage 
planted to feed-grain crops was usually sufficient to produce enough 
grain to feed the mule necessary to take care of the cotton that was 
grown. Even though the acreage planted to feed-grain crops is 
considerably larger than the acreage planted to cotton, feed-grains 
are not grown commercially, almost the entire production being used 
to feed the livestock on the farm. 

Cotton is the major cash crop on nearly all farms in the area. 
When classed as to the type of farming, almost all of the renters and 
croppers have to be classed as cotton farmers. (See table 27). Among 
the white farm owners, a large majority were classed as cotton farms 
but 32 of these had sufficient livestock to put them in a cotton- 
livestock classification. Eight other farms were classed as cotton- 
truck and 12 were classed as general farms. There were only four 
negro ov^ers that were classed as cotton-livestock farmers. Three

had sufficient truck crops to place them in the cotton-truck classifica- 
tion and four were classed as general farms. On the basis of these 
tabulations, the major departure from the straight cotton type of 
farming was found in the white-owner group and to a lesser extent 
in the negro-owner group. With very few exceptions, renters and 
sharecroppers were all in the cotton type of farming classification. 

The amount of land resources available apparently has a great 
influence on the number of productive livestock that can be kept on 
these farms. White owners, for example, have the largest number of 
animal units of productive livestock. (See table 28). Many negro own- 
ers likewise have some productive livestock, but have not gone into the 
livestock business to the same extent as many of the white operators. 
On the other hand, on both the renter and sharecropper farms where 
land resources are limited, the animal units of livestock are very 
small. This is particularly true in the negro sharecropper group 
where 45 out of a total of 56 have one or less units of productive 
livestock.

It should be said that livestock enterprises are not particularly 
important in any part of this area and with the limited amount of 
land resources available to the average farmer, it is not likely that 
they will become of any great importance until some change is made. 
At the present time, the only place where livestock enterprises are of 
any importance is on the larger owner-operated farms. The less than 
40 acres of cropland available to at least two-thirds of the farmers in 
this area is not sufficient to support much more than just enough 
livestock to provide for home needs. 

Use of All Resources 

In previous sections of this report, the amount of labor avail- 
able, the capital investments in the form of machinery and equip- 
ment, and the amount of land available have been shown for various 
sizes of farms for both race and tenure groups. These are the fac- 
tors of production that each farm operator has to combine on his 
farm in the production of farm commodities. The amount of income 
at the end of the year depends not only upon the amounts of these 
factors available, but the way in which they are combined on the 
individual farm. The quantity of these factors available together 
with the way they are combined, are most readily measured by the 
total amount of income derived from the entire operation. For in- 



36 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



stance, the gross farm income for the 27 white farm owners with less 
than 20 acres of cropland averaged $653. (See table 29). 

On the other hand, the 9 white sharecroppers that had less than 
20 acres in cropland had an average gross farm income of $861. This 
same relationship exists between the white owners and the white 
sharecroppers that had between 20 and 30 acres of cropland, because 
in this group also, the sharecroppers had a slightly larger gross in- 
come. 

It was not until the group of farms that had between 40 and 80 
acres of cropland was reached that the owner farms showed a larger 
gross income than the sharecropper farms. When compared on the 
basis of family earnings this same relationship exists. That is, the 
total family earnings in the sharecropper groups are about equal or 
larger than for the same size groups of white owners. When an al- 
lowance for the unpaid family labor is deducted and the comparison 
is made on the basis of operator's earnings, a definite advantage for

the sharecropper group is shown only for those having less than 20 
acres in cultivation. This is a definite reflection of the fact that tiie 
sharecroppers have larger families and consequently more unpaid 
family labor than the owners. 

Negro farm owners, on the average, have less gross farm income 
than negro sharecroppers in all groups except those having over 80 
acres of land in cultivation. The advantage in gross farm income in 
favor of the negro sharecroppers is large enough to offset the addi- 
tional amount they have to pay out in the form of shares and still 
give them average family and operators earnings larger than the 
negro owners. This applies to all negro farms where there are 
sufficient numbers to make reliable comparisons. When productive 
man-work-units are used as the size measure, the relationships are 
the same as when acres in cultivation are used. (See table 30). 

Renters in both white and negro groups for all sizes have smaller

incomes than sharecroppers. In fact, renters as a group had a smal- 
ler average income than any other tenure group. 

It would seem from these figures that for practically all of the 
negro farm operators and all the small and medium size white farm 
operators, the sharecroppers have a larger gross as well as net farm 
income from their operations than the owners or renters in the same 
group. It can be concluded further that the advantage in favor of 
farm ownership is not reached until the size of the farm is con- 
siderably larger than the average found in this area. 

The low income on the small white owner farms was supple- 
mented to a considerable extent by outside non-farm income. The 
average white farm owner had $556 of non-farm income during 
1942. Because of the unusual employment opportunities offered 
during this year, this is probably larger than would be expected dur- 
ing any normal year. The very small white owners derived some- 
what more non-farm income than from their farming operations. 
It is entirely possible that these unusual opportunities for off -farm 
employment may have affected the farming operations on these small 
farms during this particular year. 

The neglect of the farm and its operations could have been one 
of the causes for the fairly low income on some of these farms. How- 
ever, off -farm employment opportunities were available to the white 
sharecroppers and they took advantage of these opportunities but not 
to the same extent as the white owners. 

Negro owners had an average of $262 of non-farm income while 
the negro sharecroppers had only $125 from this source. 

The non-farm income for the owner groups is about enough in 
each case to make up the difference in farm income. However, the 
fact remains that from a strictly farming standpoint, the sharecrop- 
per system provided a larger income for the operators following this 
system than ownership provided for those families that owned small 
farms. One possible explanation of this situation may be that share- 
croppers as a group probably were on better land than small farmers. 
In most instances, the larger farm owners in any area will have 
access to some of the best land in the area and, of course, it is only 
these larger farms that have sufficient land resources to use share- 
croppers. 

The higher yields obtained by the sharecropper groups indicate 
that they were probably on better land than the small owners. (See 
table 31). The 50-year average cotton yield was 243 pounds of lint for 
white owners with less than 20 acres and 275 pounds for sharecrop- 
pers in the same size group. The crop yield index was 110 for the 
owners and 125 for the sharecroppers when compared on the same 
basis as above. In the next size group from 20 to 40 acres of crop- 
land, the cotton yield and the crop yield index for white operators are 
almost the same for the owners and sharecroppers. It is not until 
the medium to large owner farms are reached that a distinct advant- 
age in yield is shown for the owner-operated farms. However, there 
are not enough sharecroppers in these large size groups to make

reliable comparisons. The average crop yield index is higher for all 
white croppers than for all white owners. 

The 5-year average cotton yield and the crop index are higher 
for the negro sharecroppers in all size groups than for negro owners. 
The 5-year average cotton yield for all negro owners was 197 pounds 
while for negro sharecroppers it was 281 pounds. The average crop 
yield index was 78 for negro owners and 109 for negro sharecroppers. 

The higher yields obtained by the sharecroppers probably result 
from better land and the advantage of good management. Farm op- 
erators and other landlords that have accumulated enough capital 
to become large farmers almost always have considerable managerial 
ability. Sharecroppers on farms owned and operated by these 
superior managers have a distinct advantage over many of the owners 
of small farms. Unless a farmer has unusual ability along with con- 
siderable determination, it is very difficult for him to accumulate 
enough capital from the operations of a small farm operated with 



40 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 430 



small, labor consuming equipment to gradually make him a larger 
farm operator. 

About the only chance he has of increasing his farm capital is to 
supplement his farm income by off-farm employment. As is shown 
in table 29, many of the white as well as negro farm owners did this 
during the year studied. It is possible that many small farm opera- 
tors are able to become larger farm owners in this manner. This 
applies particularly to the white owner group. 

Among the negroes it seems that only a very few have thus far 
succeded in becoming very large farm owners. In the sample 
studied, only 2 out of a total of 55 negro owners had over 80 acres 
of land in cultivation. Observations made by the enumerators in- 
dicate that for the most part these negro owners are on poor land, 
have very inefficient machinery and equipment, and in many in- 
stances are poor managers. 

As has already been pointed out, these observations are further 
substantiated by the fact that negro owners in all groups have smaller 
incomes than negro sharecroppers. It would seem from these facts 
that it might be a wise policy for farm operators, both negro and 
white, with limited capital to farm as sharecroppers on large farms 
with good land and good managerial supervision, until they can 
accumulate the necessary capital to make an initial payment on at 
least an average size farm. In many instances, the farm operator's 
chances of becoming a successful farm owner would be greater if he 
started in this manner rather than as an owner on a small farm with 
poor land and poor equipment. 

The ideal of farm ownership is not a worthy ideal if it means 
half starvation and virtual bondage on 20 to 30 acres of poor land 
with a poor mule and half-row equipment. In many cases, there 
seems to be considerable evidence that ownership of this type should 
be placed at the very bottom of the agricultural ladder rather than 
at the top. In the area studied in Mississippi as well as many other 
areas in the State and the South, this type of ownership places a man 
in a position where it is almost impossible for him ever to accumulate 
enough capital from the operations of the farm itself to make him 
an independent, successful farm operator. As has been pointed out 
already, about the only chance he has to accumulate capital is to seek 
employment off the farm. On the other hand, the operator who 
succeeds in getting a sharecropper holding on a successful, large 
farm unit has an opportunity to advance himself along the agri- 
cultural ladder and eventually become a successful farm owner. 

Conclusions 

The average farm family on a small owner-operated farm did 
not have as much farm income during 1942 as the farm family that 
operated on a sharecropper basis. This was true for both white 
and negro farmers but was more pronounced with the latter group. 
The labor force, the equipment used, the cropping pattern and the 



LAND TENURE IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA OF MISSISSIPPI 41 



land resources averaged about the same in the two tenure groups for 
both white and colored operators. 

The major items of equipment used were very nearly the same 
for all tenure and race groups. The half -row one-mule type of equip- 
ment predominated on all farms. Even the larger farms that were 
operated by tenants used a set of one-mule equipment for each tenant. 
Only three tractors were found on the 327 farms included in this 
study. 

Apparently the tenure system along with the cotton type of farm- 
ing has delayed the introduction of labor-saving machinery and equip- 
ment on the larger farms in this area. On the other hand, a large 
proportion of the owner operated farms are too small for efficient 
use of the larger types of equipment. 

The improvement of farm incomes in this area is limited by the 
size of many of the farms and the lack of improved equipment both 
of which have been instrumental in keeping a large farm population 
in the area in relation to the land resources. The present and po- 
tential farm income can be increased by improved practices, better 
management and other means, but is limited by the burden of people 
on the land. The general use of improved equipment will depend 
upon the increase in size of many farms and will result in many 
changes in the traditional tenure system practiced in the area.

FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI

Farm Management and Costs of Production on 40 Farms 
in Northeast Mississippi 

By W. J. EDENSi 



This bulletin reports a study, by the cost account method, of 40 
dairy and cotton farms in Northeast Mississippi for the calendar year 
1944. The purpose of the study was to determine farm costs and 
farm management practices in their relation to production problems 
and income, especially on farms producing milk for sale, and with 
possible recommendations for adjustments. Attention in particular 
is given to the costs of producing milk and cotton in their relation- 
ship to types of farm organization, and profits derived from these 
major enterprises as well as from minor enterprises and the farm 
business as a whole. It is hoped that the results of this study will 
stimulate farmers of the area to give more thought to the organiza- 
tion of their farms and to utilize more efficiently the land, capital, 
and labor under their management, and will serve as a means of 
facilitating the agricultural extension program of this State. 

Most of the farms in Northeast Mississippi produce cotton and 
a large number keep milk cows. Cotton has been the principal 
income crop since the area was first settled. Since the turn of the cen- 
tury, it has been demonstrated that a single row-crop enterprise as 
the main source of income involves considerable risk and does not 
give a return to the farm business as a whole comparable to that 
which is realized when income enterprises are more diversified. 
Consequently, farmers and various agricultural agencies have been 
endeavoring to find the best means and methods to be used in pro- 
viding the most profitable combination of enterprises for farms in 

each of the naturally defined areas of the State. 
• 

Emphasis has been placed on more livestock production as well 
as improved practices in growing crops. For the past three decades, 
much attention has been given to dairying as a supplement to cotton 
production. Agricultural and various business and civic agencies have 
encouraged the establishment of milk processing plants such as cheese 
factories, creameries, and condenseries in many communities of the 
State with most of the larger plants located in Northeast Mississippi. 
Fifty-seven of these plants have been established since 1912. At 
present, 31 are in operation with most of the fatalities having oc-

curred among creameries. Nineteen of the 31 plants now in opera- 
tion are located in the 11 counties constituting the Northeast Mis- 
sissippi Milkshed Area.' 

With the coming of these plants, the dairy cow population in the 
respective communities, or patronage areas, increased considerably. 
Many thought that this step in farm enterprise diversification would 
solve the one-crop system of farming. It has helped; but the prob- 
lems have arisen such as low production per cow, unprofitable 
methods of feeding, high-cost transportation, low production during 
winter months making it difficult for milk plants to operate effi- 
ciently during that period, and dairy cattle diseases, and parasites. 
While some farmers appeared to be profiting by adding dairying to 
their business, others appeared to be deriving little benefits from 
milking cows along with the production of cotton. 

Since so many factors — size, rates of production, combination 
of enterprises, use of labor, farm practices — are responsible for de- 
termining the profit made by the farm business, it was thought that 
if a study were made of representative farms where milk was pro- 
duced and sold to milk plants so that detailed attention could be 
given to those factors largely determining profits, much benefit 
might be derived for both farmers and milk plants. 

Location of Farms Studied 

Farms selected to cooperate in this study were located in Alcorn, 
Prentiss, Lee, Chickasaw, and Noxubee Counties, all of which are 
found in the three major soil areas of Northeast Mississippi, namely, 
Northeast Highlands, Northeast Prairie, and the Pontotoc Ridge. 
(See figure 1.) Though the Northeast Prairie Area separates the 
Northeast Highlands and Pontotoc Ridge Areas, the soils of all three 
areas are rather distinct. 

The Northeast Highland Soil Area developed mostly from coastal 
plain deposits of sand, clay, and gravel. They are red or yellow 
wherever the drainage is good, and are generally quite sandy in tex- 
ture. The rugged topography of parts of the area and poor solid 
management practices have contributed to severe erosion of the soil 
on many farms. The commonly occurring soils of the Northeast 
Highlands are Ruston, Savannah, Cuthbert, Paden, and Ocklocknee. 
The principal crops grown in this area are cotton, corn, oats, les- 
pedeza, cowpeas, and soybeans. In addition to the field crops, pine 
timber affords a cash income in several locations. 

The soils of the Northeast Prairie are derived from soft, chalky 
limestone and clays which are coastal plain deposits. Because of the 
nature of the parent material, the soils possess texture of the clay 
and heavy clay classes. The topography is gently rolling and sheet 
erosion has wrought great damage to much farm land. The soils 
are easily recognized by the dark and red colors, and vegetation of 
grass and post oak. The dark soils are Houston, Sumpter, and Trinity,

Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 422, July, 1945.

commonly called "Black Prairie", and the red soils are Oktibbeha 
and Montrose, commonly called "Post Oak Prairie." The crops 
grown are cotton, corn, oats and silage crops, and much livestock is 
fed. Johnson grass is well adapted to this area and is used for hay 
along with soybeans. Dallis grass and white and hop clovers, make 
excellent pastures in this area and contribute much to the production 
of livestock. 

Soils of the Pontotoc Ridge Area have developed from marine 
deposits of sands and clays that are reddish in color, and naturally 
the soils are predominantly reddish in color. The texture varies 
from a sandy loam to clay. The topography is rolling to rough and 
rugged. Thus, the soils have suffered severe damage from accele- 
rated erosion where protective measures have not been applied. The 
main soils are Greenville, Orangeburg, and Ruston, on uplands, and 
Hannahatchie and Ocklocknee. The principal crops are corn and 
cotton for row crops ; lespedeza, soybeans, and cowpeas for hay. 
Pine timber also contributes to the income of the farmers.' 

Method of Selecting Fanns 

Farms selected for this study were suggested by county agricul- 
tural agents, milk plant managers and their field men, county repre- 
sentatives of the Agricultural Adjustment Agency, and local repre- 
sentatives of the Soil Conservation Service. These agricultural 
leaders were requested by personal interview to suggest farmers who, 
they thought, were progressive in their farm operations, would be 
interested in making a study of their farm business, and would be 
willing to keep the necessary records. 

The enterprise organization of each farm was studied by means 
of the 1944 farm plan sheets made available by the several county 
AAA officers. Farms were then divided into three groups de- 
termined by the emphasis placed on the production of milk and cotton, 
and farm types were so designated. Farms with a large number of cows 
compared with the number of acres in cotton comprised one group, or 
dairy-cotton farms. A few farms in this group did not grow cotton 
after having planned to do so. Where the number of acres of cotton 
was large in proportion to the number of cows, the farm type was 
designated cotton-dairy. The farms having about the same number 
of cows as acres of cotton constituted the third type, or dairy & cotton. 
Of the 40 farms keeping records, 16 were dairy-cotton, 12 cotton- 
dairy, and 12 dairy & cotton. This manner of grouping was selected 
in order that comparisons could be made relative to cost factors and 
income for the various farm enterprises under different organiza- 
tional conditions. 

Operators of the farms thus selected were interviewed on their 
farms where consent was obtained to keep the necessary rcords. The 
supervision of the keeping of the records was done by a member of 
the Experiment Station staff, and each farm was visited once every 
4 weeks. 



iThp description of these three soil areas was taken larprely from their description 
as set forth by the Mississippi State Department of Agriculture, 1942. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 9 



Description of Farms Studied 

Land Utilization 



The average amount of land per farm for the 40 farms was 170 
acres. Table 1 shows how the total land for all farms as a whole and 
by types of farms was used. Cropland accounted for 75 acres per 
farm, or 44 percent of total land. Open, tillable pasture land amount- 
ed to 43 acres per farm, representing 25 percent of all land ; and open 
non-tillable pasture land amounted to 21 acres, or 12 percent. Thus, 
81 percent of all land was open land. Woods pastured accounted for 
8 percent of the land per farm ; woods not pastured, 5 percent ; and 
the other land used for miscellaneous purposes, 5 percent. It will 
be noted that pasture land of all kinds amounted to 88 acres, or 
slightly more than one-half of the total average acreage per farm. 

On farms where cotton was the major enterprise, 55 percent 
of the land was cropland. Where dairy cows were the major enter- 
prise, 30 percent of the land was cropland ; and where the two enter- 
prises ranked about the same, 42 percent of the land was devoted to 
crops. It will be noted that where major emphasis was placed on 
dairy cows, slightly more than half of the total land was devoted to 
open pasture. Where cotton received major emphasis, only 30 per- 
cent of the farm acreage was used for open pasture land.

Crop Acres 

On the average, more acreas of land were devoted to corn than to 
cotton. Corn and cotton acreages were about the same on cotton- 
dairy farms. Hay constituted the largest acreage of any crop. 
Table 2 shows the relative importance of crops grown. Other than 
cotton, cash crops were relatively unimportant on most farms. Two 
farms produced hay for sale and one raised watermelons and 
cantaloupes for the market. It will be noted that less than one-half 
acre per farm was used for growing silage crops. Only six farmers

grew silage. These six farms grew an average of 2 acres per farm.

1. Crop acres — Total acres of crops, includes double cropping. 



2. Double-cropping acres are included in the above crop acreages. 

On farms where dairying was the major enterprise, 74 percent 
of the acres cropped was devoted to feed crops; on cotton-dairy 
farms, 69 percent; and on dairy & cotton farms, 69 percent. Acres 
of oats per farm averaged 6.8. However, only 14 of the 40 farms 
actually growing oats had an average of 19.4 acres per farm. 

Hay was an important crop on most of the farms. Johnson 
grass predominated in the Northeast Prairie Area, but in the Ponto- 
toc Ridge and Northeast Highland Areas, soybean acreage for hay 
was greatest. Lespedeza was next in importance. A considerable 
number of farms interplanted corn with soybeans and harvested the 
plants for hay or stocked them down. Most of the farmers growing 
soybean hay, ground it before feeding it to dairy cows and other 
livestock. 

Classes of Livestock 

Dairy cows were the most numerous livestock on the average 
farm. Table 3 shows the importance of all classes of livestock. The 
average number of dairy cows per farm was 14, with a total value 
of $981 per farm, or an average value of $69 per cow. Milk cows 
constituted 47.3 percent of the total farm investment in livestock. 
The range in number of dairy cows for all farms was from 4 to 40. 
Only two farms milked less than 6 cows ; 4 less than 7 cows ; and 10 
less than 10 cows. Nine farms milked 20 or more cows. Nineteen 
herds averaged 4,000 pounds per cow or more, and 8 had an average 
production of more than 5,000 pounds of milk per year. The range in 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 11 



the amount of milk produced per cow per year was from 2,200 

pounds to 5,800 pounds with 4 herds producing less than 3,000 
pounds per cow.

2. Average for 39 farms. 

Other cattle' amounted to 11 head per farm and 19.2 percent of 
the total average investment in livestock. Other cattle consisted of 
bred heifers, steers, bulls, and calves. Hogs were of minor im- 
portance on more than 75 percent of all farms. A few farmers raised 
hogs for the market while all others grew hogs primarily for home 
consumption, selling the small surplus produced. 

Most poultry flocks were for home use. However, a majority 
of the farms sold some eggs and a few sold young birds. Nine farms 
had more than 100 hens, and 4 had more than 150 hens. 

Table 3 shows the importance of workstock. Next to milk cows, 
the largest investment in livestock was in the enterprise used for 
farm power. 

Farm Investnient 

The investment per farm amounted to $10,743. The distribution 
of this investment is shown in table 4. Cotton-dairy farms had the 
largest investment, as might be expected on account of larger crop- 
land requirements. Dairy-cotton and dairy & cotton farms were 
more nearly equal in real estate investment and total investment.

real estate for the 40 farms was 60.2 percent. On cotton-dairy 
farms the investment in real estate was 68 percent, while dairy- 
cotton and dairy & cotton farms had a real estate investment of 52.5 
and 56.1 percent, respectively. Investment in livestock was lowest 
on cotton-dairy farms. The relative investments in feeds and equip- 
ment were about the same. 

On farms where dairy cows were the major enterprise and on 
farms where cows and cotton received about the same emphasis, the 
total investment per farm was approximately one-half of the invest- 
ment on farms where cotton was the major enterprise. The percent 
return on investment for cotton-dairy farms was 10.4, on dairy- 
cotton farms 14.4 percent, and 16.2 percent on dairy & cotton farms.

Farm Receipts and Expenses 

Farm receipts are the total income from farm sources. They 
include money received or due from the sale of the current year's 
crops, sale of livestock and livestock products, sale of equipment and 
supplies, and any increase in the inventory value of the farm property. 
Farm receipts for the 40 farms averaged $5,930. (See table 6.)

♦The operator's labor was Vfvlued at cxirrent wages for a hired man without 
meals and lodging for 12 months. Unpaid family labor was valued at the same rate. 



Farm expenses represent the cost of operating the farm busi- 
ness, except for interest on investment and value of the operator's 
time. Farm expenses include all cash expenses for labor, feed, 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 13 



supplies, taxes, etc. ; the value of unpaid family labor other than the 
operator's ; the value of board furnished hired help ; the cost of live- 
stock and equipment purchased; and any decrease in the inventory 
value of farm property. Farm expenses, or farm business expenses, 
do not include family living expenses. The average farm expenses 
for 40 farms was $3,973. 

Farm Returns 

Farm income and other measures of return to the farm operator 
are also shown in table 6. Farm income, which is farm receipts less 
farm expenses, amounted to $1,957 for the 40 farms as a whole. 
Deducting from farm income the amount of interest at 5 percent 
on the average investment, gives a labor income of $1,420. Labor 
earnings are found by combining labor income and farm privileges.' 
This amounted to $2,010 per farm. 

The operator's time was valued at current wages paid hired 
labor without board and lodging in Northeast Mississippi, as reported 
by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. All operators were credit- 
ed with 12 months of labor except one who spent some of his time 
off the farm. 

Return on the average farm investment was $1,400 or 13 percent. 
The operator's time may have been undervalued. If that were true, 
the percentage return on investment would be less in proportion to 
the increase of the value of the operator's time. 

Farm receipts and expenses for the different types of farms 
varied directly with the size of the investment.. However, it will 
be noticed that labor income did not vary much from one type to 
another. Causes for these differences and similarities will be dis- 
cussed in following sections of this study. 



Methods Used in Determining the Costs of Producing Milk 

All farm costs were determined by means of a set of accounts 
kept by each farmer. Records began with taking an opening in- 
ventory, January 1, 1944, and included transactions during the year 
pertaining to the farm business. The closing inventory was taken 
December 31. Daily labor records, feeding records, production 
records, cash records, and other records were kept. Methods used 
in keeping these records follow. 

Feed. Feeds fed to dairy cows were both purchased and pro- 
duced on the farm. Most concentrates were purchased, whereas, 
practically all roughages were grown by the farmer. Purchased 
feeds were charged at market price, and home-grown feeds were 
charged at farm price. Farm price was market price less the cost 
of transportation to the market. 

The amount of feeds fed was recorded monthly. Once each 
month — usually the latter part of the month — the farmer determined 
the pounds of concentrates and roughages fed to his herd for one day, 
and multiplied these amounts by the number of days in the month. 



iParm privileges means contributions made by the farm to family living, sucli 
BM house rent and foods. 



14 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



If changes occurred in the kinds of feed fed during the month, or if 
the number of cows in the herd increased or decreased, this was taken 
into consideration in order not to overcharge or undercharge the 
proper amounts. The pasture cost was computed by determining 
the total pasture cost for all livestock and then allocating the pro- 
portionate part to the milk cows. This cost was estimated by the 
farmer. 

Pasture. Pasture costs included interest on investment in pas- 
ture land, taxes, man and horse labor used on the pastures, and the 
cost of pasture fences. Crops grazed, such as oats, were charged 
at the rate of $3.00 per month for each milk cow. 

Man labor. The charge for man labor was the average cost per 
hour for all labor on the farm except that of cotton croppers. Crop- 
per cotton bbor was charged directly to the cotton enterprise. Thus, 
the cost per mar. hour for all enterprises other than cotton was the 
average cost per hour on the farm for all labor except labor spent 
on cotton by cropper tenants. In addition to cash wages, labor costs 
included the value of the operator's time, unpaid family labor, and 
the use of tenant houses. The average rate per hour was determined 
by dividing the total labor costs, less the value of the cropper's share 
of the cotton and seed, by the total hours of work less the hours spent 
on cotton by croppers. The total cost of man labor for milk cows 
was completed by multiplying the average farm labor hour rate by 
the total hours spent on milk cows. Hours of labor spent on cows 
included the time spent in milking, feeding, cleaning milk house, and 
washing utensils. 

Buildings. The cows were charged with their proportionate 
part of the cost of maintaining building for the year. This cost 
included repairs, depreciation, interest on investment, insurance and 
taxes. The total expense for any building used entirely for milk cows 
was charged to the herd. 

Dairy equipment. The investment in equipment for most herds 
was small. This cost included depreciation, repairs, and interest 
on investment. 

Depreciation on cows. Depreciation on milk cows was de- 
terminated by using the following formula : depreciation equals (value 
of cows at the beginning of year plus value of heifers freshening 
plus value of cows purchased) minus (value of cows at the end of 
year plus value of cows sold and any that died). This charge for 
depreciation accounts for both depreciation in the case of young 
cows and depreciation for old cows. 

Interest. Milk cows were charged with interest at the rate of 
5 percent on the average of the beginning and ending inventories 
values. 

Milk hauling. Practically all farmers hired the hauling of their 
milk to the milk plants. Where the farmer hauled his own milk, man 
hours and the proportionate part of the truck, or car, costs used for 
handling the milk were estimated by the farmer. 

Miscellaneous costs. Miscellaneous costs included such items 
as the proportionate part of truck or auto expense, electricity, sprays, 
disinfectants, veterinary services, medicines, etc. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 15 



Costs and Returns for Milk Production 

Milk was produced for sale on all farms. About 12 percent of 
all milk produced was used on the farm. Practically all of the re- 
maining 88 percent was sold to cheese plants and condenseries. A 
few farmers sold their milk to wholesale distributors. 

The average number of milk cows per farm was 14. (See table 7.) 
This average number of milk cows per herd was computed from the 
beginning and ending inventories and five other inventories during 
the year. Milk produced per farm amounted to 55,991 pounds, or 
3,931 pounds per cow. The family used 3,861 pounds of milk, and 
the average farm fed 2,729 pounds of milk to calves. 

A study of table 7 shows the amount of costs for the various 
items entering into the total costs for the average dairy herd as well 
as per cow and per 100 pounds of milk. This table also shows herd 
credits, such as manure and calves produced, and the returns from 
milk produced. Detail consideration is given to these items in the 
sections that follow.

Feed Costs 

Feed was the largest item of cost in the production of milk. (See 
table 7.) The feed cost per herd for one year on all farms averaged 
$1,109. Of this, concentrates amounted to $608 ; roughage, $372 ; and 
pasture, $129. This total feed cost amounted to 59.6 percent of total 
milk production costs. On a per cow basis, this feed cost per year, 
was $78, and the feed cost to produce 100 pounds of milk was $1.98. 

^ The amount of feed per cow varied considerably, and much of this 
variation was due to whether there was available suitable land for 
hay and pasture production in the three soils areas in Northeast 
Mississippi — Black Prairie, Northeast Highland, and Pontotoc Ridge. 
The five farms feeding the least concentrates averaged 642 pounds 
per cow. The five farms feeding the most concentrates averaged 
2,898 pounds per cow. The five farms feeding the least roughage 
averaged 969 pounds per cow, and the five farms feeding the most 
roughage averaged 5,157 pounds per cow. The capacity of milk cows, 
the knowledge of farmers relative to desirable feeding standards, 
and high feed costs were other factors contributing to the wide varia- 
tion in the amounts of feed fed on various farms. 

Tables 8 and 9 show the relationships of concentrates and rough- 
ages fed per cow to milk produced per cow% and the cost to produce 
100 pounds of milk. When concentrates fed per cow were increased, 
milk produced per cow increased. On the other hand, when rough- 
age per cow was increased, there was a slight decrease in the amount 
of milk produced. The cost to produce milk increased as the amount 
of both concentrates and roughage fed per cow was increased.

FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 17 



dairy-cotton farms, cotton-dairy farms, and dairy & cotton farms, 
as well as for the five lowest cost' farms and the five highest 
cost^ farms. 

Concentrates fed during the year to cows on dairy-cotton farms 
amounted to $50.51 per cow, which was the highest value of the three 
types of farms. This could be expected on farms where farmers 
placed the most emphasis on the dairy enterprise. However, these 
same farms had the least roughage cost of $23.70 per cow, compared 
with $32.14 for cotton-dairy farms, and $24.66 for dairy & cotton 
farms. Total feed costs were the greatest on dairy-cotton farms, 
next on cotton-dairy, and least on dairy & cotton farms. 

The five farms producing milk at lowest cost, fed $43.10 worth 
of feed per cow, and the five farms producing milk at the highest cost 
fed $96.34 worth of feed. Since cows on high cost farms produced 
only 3,230 pounds each, this would indicate that these farm operators 
were attempting to get high production out of cows of low efficiency. 

Man Labor Costs 

Labor used to produce milk was furnished primarily by members 
of the operator's family. A few farmers hired some labor for the 
dairy enterprise, paying cash wages, a part of the milk check, or by 
allowing the helper so much milk for family use. Farm labor was 
very scarce in 1944 and, consequently, high priced. Due to this fact, 
labor costs were relatively higher than other fixed costs as buildings, 
equipment, depreciation on cows, and interest charges. 

The cost of labor per herd was $507 as shown in table 7. The 
average number of man hours spent on one cow per year was 145, 
and was valued at $35.62. This amounted to 91 cents per 100 pounds 
of milk produced. The labor cost range for 100 pounds of milk was 
from 46 cents to $1.65. The amount of labor used per cow for one 
year ranged from a low of 96 hours for the 10 lowest farms to a high 
of 209 hours per cow for the 10 farms requiring the greatest amount 
of labor. The average cost of labor per hour spent on milk cows on 
all 40 farms was 24,5 cents. The range for this man-hour costs was 
from 16.4 cents to 39.5 cents. In producing milk, man labor ac- 
counted for 27.3 percent of the gross farm cost to produce 100 pounds 
of milk. Consequently the efficient use of labor is an important 
factor in producing milk economically.

1. The cost of producing 100 pounds of milk. 

The cost of producing milk on dairy and cotton farms was lowest and profit per 
cow was highest. Dairy and cotton farms spent less for feeds, less than average 
for labor, and had the highest production per cow. 

Building Costs 

Milk cows were charged with building costs on the basis of the 
proportionate part of the barn used by the cows. This cost amounted 
to $34.47 per herd for the year, or $2.42 per cow. The building cost 
per 100 pounds of milk produced was $0.06. 

Equipment Costs 

Equipment cost per herd amounted to $18.05. The cost per cow 
for one year was $1.27, and the cost per 100 pounds of milk produced 
was $0.03. 

Depreciation Costs 

The depreciation on the average herd of cows was $82.71. This 
amounted to $5.81 per cow, or 15 cents per 100 pounds of milk pro- 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 19 



duced. This cost accounted for 4.4 percent of the total gross farm 
cost of producing milk. 

Interest Cost 

Interest cost at 5 percent on the average investment in the herd 
amounted to $48.75. This v^as equivalent to $3.42 per cow and about 
$0.09 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Miscellaneous Costs 

Miscellaneous costs v^^ere $59.83 per herd, or $4.20 per cow. This 
cost amounted to about $0.10 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Gross Farm Costs 

The gross farm costs per herd for the year was $1,860. Thus, 
the average gross cost to keep a cow for one year was $130.61, and 
this amounted to $3.32 per 100 pounds of milk produced. The range 
of cost for keeping a cow for one year on the entire 40 farms' was 
from $73 to $257. The range in cost of producing 100 pounds of 
milk was from $1.77 to $5.56. 

Credits 

Each cow was credited with 5 tons of manure since this was the 
estimated amount that was saved per cow. The manure was valued 
at $1.50 per ton. Credit for calves produced amounted to $2.00 per 
cow. Total credits were $137.17 for each herd or $9.63 per cow. 
This credit amounted to $0.24 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Net Farm Costs 

Net farm costs are gross farm costs less total credits. Net farm 
costs amounted to $1,723 per herd as shown in table 7. This gave 
a net cost of $121 per cow and $3.08 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Hauling Charges 

Charges for hauling milk to the milk plant for the year amounted 
to $126 per herd, $8.85 per cow, and about $0,025 per 100 pounds of 
milk. When adding this cost to net farm costs, it gives a cost of $3.33 
per 100 pounds of milk delivered at the plant. 

Returns For Milk Sold 

The amount of milk sold per farm was 49,401 pounds, or 3,468 
pounds per cow. This amount of milk delivered at the milk plant sold 
for $1,987. Thus the average price received for 100 pounds of milk 
by the farms was $4.02. This price per 100 pounds was slightly 
above the average milk plant price for the area due to several of the 
farms producing grade A milk for army camps and for starter milk 
at cheese plants. This better grade of milk sold at a premium. 

Milk Used on the Farm 

Milk used for personal purposes per farm amounted to 3,861 
pounds per herd, and milk fed to calves was 2,729 pounds per farm. 
Thus the total amount of milk used on each farm had a farm value 
of $232. 



20 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Profit 

Profit was determined by deducting farm costs and hauling 
charges (total costs) from total milk returns. Total milk returns per 
herd amounted to $2,219. Net farm costs per herd plus hauling 
charges amounted to $1,849. Thus the profit per herd was $370 
and per cow, $25.99. The profit per 100 pounds of milk was the 
average price received ($4.02) less the total cost per 100 pounds 
($3.33), and amounted to $0.69. 

Labor Return 

Assuming that profit on the enterprise is also a return to labor, 
the total return to labor would be profit on the enterprise plus man 
labor charges to the enterprise. The sum of $370 (profit) and $507 
(labor charges) gives a labor return of $877. This amounts to $61.61 
per cow, and $1.59 per 100 pounds of milk sold. 

What a farmer receives for his labor is of paramount importance 
to him. He has opportunities to use his labor in various ways and 
that combination of ways which gives the greatest return for the 
farm business as a whole, is the one he is continually seeking. These 
ways of using labor, of course, take form in the various enterprises 
conducted on the farm. 

Much of the labor used on the farms in this study was unpaid 
family labor. Oftentimes this labor may be used on an enterprise 
when the cost of production is relatively high, particularly where it 
is convenient to engage in that enterprise, and still receive income 
that adds to the well-being of the farmer and his family. In case of 
the dairy enterprise, the farmer charges the cows with grain, hay, 
and other feeds at farm value (market value less transportation 
costs) instead of what they actually cost. Consequently, an enter- 
prise may show a loss when its physical input costs are charged at 
farm value, yet the farmer can afford to go right along producing 
the enterprise and will be better off by doing so unless some alterna- 
tive enterprise opportunity appears whereby he can get more for his 
input costs or values. 

Of the 10 farms that made minus incomes on dairy cows, only 
3 made a minus labor return per cow. One farmer lost $31 per cow, 
but his labor return per cow was $30 and the labor return per hour 
spent producing milk was $0.17. Another farmer had a loss of $4 
per cow, yet his labor return per cow was $51 and the return per 
hour spent on milk cows was $0.32. If profit and loss had been 
computed on the basis of actual costs of producing feed on the farm, 
the return for labor would have been considerably more. Therefore, 
if a farmer receives the cost of production for 100 pounds of milk 
or a hundred pounds of cotton, that price includes the current wage 
rate for his labor and for all unpaid family 'labor. However, farmers 
are entitled to a fair profit above actual costs, as is expected in any 
other business, in order that they build up reserves for depression 
periods and for old age. 

Costs and Returns per Cow on Different Type Farms 

A study of table 10 shows costs and returns for the dairy enter- 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 21 



prise by types of farming on a per cow basis. The average costs and 
returns per cow for the 40 farms is repeated for comparative pur- 
poses. 

The annual net cost to keep a cow for one year on dairy-cotton 
farms amounted to $120. The costs on cotton-dairy farms were 
$130, and $113 on dairy & cotton farms. The annual profit per cow 
was $36 for dairy-cotton farms. There was a loss of $7 per cow for 
cotton-dairy farms, and a gain of $42 on dairy & cotton farms. It 
will be noticed that the profit was considerably greater on the farms 
where there was balanced emphasis on milk cows and cotton. Also, 
it will be noticed that cows on the dairy & cotton farms produced an 
average of 4,392 pounds of milk. That was a production of 400 
pounds per cow above the dairy-cotton farms, and 1,000 pounds more 
than on cotton-dairy farms. Feed costs and net farm costs per cow 
were less than on the other two types of farms. 

The differences between farm types pointed out in the preceding 
paragraph are favorable to those farmers who placed about the same 
emphasis on both cotton and milk cows in their farm program. Since, 
dairy & cotton farms used fewer man hours per cow, spent less for 
feed, and got a higher production from their cows, it would seem 
that their cows were more profitable because labor was used more 
efficiently and their cows were more efficient in converting feeds 
into milk. The pounds of concentrates fed per cow on dairy & cotton 
farms were about the same as fed on the other types of farms. The 
roughage fed per cow was from 200 to 400 pounds less per cow. 
Pasture conditions on dairy & cotton farms were somewhat better 
than on dairy-cotton farms and about the same as on cotton-dairy 
farms. 

Labor returns per cow were likewise greater on dairy & cotton 
farms. This return was 118 percent greater, or more than twice as 
great as the labor return on farms where emphasis was placed mainly 
on cotton. It was, however, only 9 percent greater than labor return 
per cow on farms placing major emphasis on the dairy enterprise. 



Cotton Production Costs and Returns 

Cotton was produced on 32 of the 40 farms on which records 
were kept. An average of 21.8 acres of cotton was produced on 
each farm. Actual bales ginned per farm was 20.2 or nearly one 
bale per acre. The number of 500-pound bales produced per farm 
was 21.3. The average price received per pound of lint cotton for 
all farms was 21.21 cents, and the cost to produce one pound of lint 
was 13.28 cents. 

A study of table 11 shows the amount of cost items for the 
average cotton enterprise on 32 farms. The average cost of each 
item is shown for the total cotton enterprise, one acre of seed cotton, 
one 500-pound bale and seed, 500 pounds of lint, total lint, total seed, 
the cost of producing one pound of lint, and the proportionate part 
each item of cost was of the total cost of producing one pound of lint. 
Items of cotton cost are discussed in the following paragraphs. 



22 MISSISSIPPI AGRICCJLTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Man Labor 



It will be observed, table 11, that man labor was the largest item 
of costs in producing cotton. The total man-labor cost for the aver- 
age cotton enterprise on 32 farms in Northeast Mississippi was 
$1,089. This labor cost was $50 per acre of cotton grown, $51 per 
500-pound bah and seed, and $40 per 500 pounds of lint. Man-labor 
cost per pound of lint was 8.04 cents, which constituted 60.5 percent 
of the total cost to produce one pound. Consequently, any steps taken 
by farmers to reduce the cost of producing cotton will necessarily 
include the consideration of man labor. 

The man labor required to grow an acre of cotton amounted to 
141 hours, and only 3 hours more were required to produce a 500- 
pound bale since production was so near one bale per acre. The 
range in hours required per acre of cotton on the 32 farms was from 
63 to 176. Barring the fact that there were differences in yield per 
acre among farms, there still would be much room for increasing 
the efficiency of labor. And since this cost item is 60.5 percent of 
the total cost of production, farmers could well look to using available 
labor on the farm, as well as hired labor, to a more distinctive ad- 
vantage.

FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 23 



Horse Labor 

Labor performed by workstock held the second place in magni- 
tude of cost. Horse labor used to produce cotton averaged $195 per 
farm or $8.95 per acre. The cost of horse labor to produce one pound 
of lint cotton was 1.42 cents, or 10.8 percent of the total cost to 
produce one pound. 

Land 

Land costs (interest on investment, taxes, improvements) per 
farm for the cotton enterprise on 32 farms in Northeast Mississippi 
v^as $67. This amounted to $3.08 per acre and $3.14 per 500-pound 
bale and seed. The land cost per 500-pound bale of lint was $2.47, 
and the average cost per pound of lint was 0.5 cent. This one-half 
cent land cost per pound of lint was 3.7 percent of the total cost to 
produce a pound of lint. The average value per acre of land only 
for the 32 farms was $23.96. Total farm investment per acre was 
$63.20. 

Fertilizer 

All but six of the 32 farms used fertilizer in the production of 
cotton. Fertilizer costs for cotton were $107 per farm or $4.92 per 
acre. This was considerably more than the cost of land per acre. 
The fertilizer expense per pound of lint was 0.79 cent, or 6 percent 
of the total cost of 13.28 cents to produce a pound of lint. 

Manure 

Twenty-six of the 32 farms growing cotton applied manure in its 
production. The amount used was very small, since the average 
value of manure applied per acre on farms growing cotton was only 
$1.76 or $38 per farm. Thus the manure cost per pound of lint cotton 
was 0.28 cent. This was 2.1 percent of the total cost of producing one 
pound of lint. 

Cottonseed 

Cottonseed for planting cost $43 per farm and $1.97 per acre of 
cotton. This expense amounted to 0.32 cent per pound of lint and 
2.4 percent of the cost of producing one pound of lint. 

Tractor Expense 

Tractor expense for producing cotton averaged $22 per farm 
for the farms growing cotton. Seventeen of these farms owned 
tractors. Since the average cost per hour for operating tractors was 
49 cents, it is readily seen that the tractors were used only for a few 
hours on the cotton enterprise. When tractors were used, it was 
principally for plowing early in the year. 



24 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMKNT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Other Equipment 

Other equipment consisted of all equipment on farms except 
tractors. This cost averaged $54 per farm or $2.48 per acre for the 
equipment used in producing cotton. Equipment cost per pound of 
lint amounted to 0.40 cent, or 3 percent of the total cost to produce 
one pound of lint. 

Ginning 

The expense of ginning averaged $108 per farm and $4.96 per 
acre of cotton. This cost averaged $5.06 per 500-pound bale. This 
charge was fairly standard in all communities. Ginning cost v^as 
0.80 cent per pound of lint and 6 percent of the total cost to produce 
one pound of lint. This cost per pound of lint v^as twice that of farm 
equipment and almost twice the cost of land. As an expense of pro- 
duction, ginning came next in importance after man and horse labor 
costs. 

Miscellaneous Costs 

Miscellaneous costs amounted to $3.53 per acre and 0.57 cent per 
pound for lint. This expense was 4.3 percent of the total cost of 
producing one pound of lint. 

Total Costs of Producing Cotton 

The average cost of producing the cotton enterprise on each of 
the 32 farms was $1,800, which amounted to $83 per acre. (See table 
11.) The cost to produce 500 pounds of lint was $66, which gave a 
cost of 13.28 cents per pound for lint cotton. This return from one 
acre of cotton for lime and seed was $104 and $17.57, respectively. 
The total return from the enterprise per farm was $2,646, thereby 
leaving a profit of $846 for the cotton enterprise and $38.90 per acre 
produced. With a cost per pound of lint at 13.28 cents and an average 
price of 21.21 cents received per pound, this gave a profit of 7.93 cents 
per pound of lint to the farmers growing cotton. 

Costs of Cotton Production on Different Type Farms 

Table 12 shows the average amount of cotton produced per farm 
for 32 farms in Northeast Mississippi as well as the amounts produced 
on dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton farms. Items of 
cost of production are also given. There was much variation in the 
acreage devoted to cotton production on the three types of farms. 
The range was from 9.1 acres per farm on dairy-cotton farms to 39.9 
acres on cotton-dairy farms. Dairy & cotton farms produced 12.1 
acres, which was only 3 acres more than was produced on dairy-cotton 
farms, and less than one-third of the acres grown on cotton-dairy 
farms. The number of acres produced on the five low-cost farms 
and the five high-cost farms was about the same, and approximately 
the same as was produced on dairy & cotton farms.

1 Based on cost per pound of lint. 

The items of cost in the production of cotton varied considerably 
in value for the three types of farms. Man labor per acre, the most 
important cost item, was least on dairy-cotton farms and the most 
on cotton-dairy farms, $28 and $54 respectively. This cost was $49 
per acre on dairy & cotton farms. Horse labor costs followed the 
same pattern. The low cost of man labor to produce an acre of cotton 
on dairy-cotton farms probably was due more to the smaller yield of 
cotton per acre than to more efficient use of labor on dairy & cotton 
farms. 

Fertilizer costs varied from $2.39 per acre on dairy-cotton farms 
to $5.32 on cotton-dairy farms. The five farms producing cotton at 
the least cost per pound used $5.33 worth of fertilizer per acre. The 
total cost of producing a pound of lint on the three types of farms did 
not vary much, but was least on dairy & cotton farms. (See table 12.) 
It will be seen that the cost of production per pound on the five low 
cost farms was only 8.24 cents, while on the five high cost farms, the 
cost to produce one pound of lint was 17.17 cents. 

Cotton Returns on Diiferent Type Fanns 

Total returns per acre of cotton was the smallest on dairy-cotton 
farms. (See table 12.) This is largely the reflection of a low yield per 
acre for this type of farming. The average return per acre for all 
types was $122; for dairy-cotton, $84; for cotton-dairy, $124; and for 
dairy & cotton, $132. Profits per acre were $39, $27, $38, and $48, 



26 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



respectively. The five farms producing cotton at the lowest cost per 
pound — 8.24 cents — had a profit of $75 per acre, v^hereas $18.38 v^as 
the profit per acre on the five farms producing cotton at the highest 
cost per pound, which was 17.17 cents. 

Considering returns and profits as a whole, it appears that the 
yield per acre was the most important factor determining the cost to 
produce a pound of cotton and the return the farmer got for his labor.

Thirty-seven of the 40 farms keeping records produced corn. 
Acres per farm averaged 25.3 and the production per acre was 23.3 
bushels. On the average, 27.8 man hours and 26.7 horse hours of 
labor were required per acre.

The total average cost per farm for the corn enterprise was 
$563, or $22.23 per acre. (See table 13.) With a production of 23.3 
bushels per acre, this resulted in a cost of 95.5 cents per bushel. 
Again, as can be seen, the largest item of cost was labor. Man labor 
cost amounted to 35 percent of the total cost to produce a bushel of 
corn. Horse labor accounted for 28.3 percent. It will be recalled 
that the proportionate part of the total cost to produce one pound of 
cotton was 60.5 percent for man labor and 10.8 percent for horse 
labor. In the case of corn, horse labor has assumed a larger part of 
the cost. Again it will be noticed that the land cost to produce a 
bushel of corn was 13.8 cents. This amounts to 14.5 percent of the 
total cost to produce a bushel of corn, whereas the land cost to produce 
a pound of cotton was 0.5 cent, or 3.7 percent of the total cost to 
produce a pound. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 27 



The total return per farm from the corn enterprise was $714, or 
$28.19 per acre. The average farm value per bushel was $1.25. 
With a cost of 95.5 cents per bushel, this gave the farmers a profit of 
$151 for the corn enterprise, $5.96 per acre, and 25.5 cents per bushel. 
The labor return per hour spent on corn was $0.49. 

Costs and Returns for Hogs 

Thirty-eight of the 40 farms produced hogs. Only a few farmers 
produced for the market. Sales by others were for the purpose of 
disposing of a small surplus produced. 

Table 14 shows that it cost $12.41 gross to produce 100 pounds 
of live pork. Of this amount 83.5 percent was for feed. On an 
average, 306 pounds of corn valued at $7.54, 82 pounds of other feed 
valued at $2.66, and pasture valued at 16 cents constituted the kinds, 
amounts, and values of feeds fed to produce this 100 pounds of live 
pork. It required 5.8 hours of man labor per 100 pounds of pork 
valued at $1.46 which represented 11.8 percent of the total cost to 
produce 100 pounds of pork. 

Considering credits of manure and miscellaneous credits which 
amounted to $0.38 per 100 pounds, the net cost to produce 100 pounds 
was $12.03. The value per 100 pounds of live pork produced was 
$12.53, which left a profit of $0.50 per 100 pounds. This small profit 
on producing hogs was due to the unfavorable hog-corn ratio in 
Northeast Mississippi in 1944.

Workstock Costs 

Workstock was used on all farms and there was an average of 
4.3 head per farm. Each head of workstock worked 462 hours, or 46 
work days of 10 hours each during the year. The average cost for all 
farms was 22.9 cents per hour. 

Table 15 shows the items of cost included in keeping workstock 
for one year. Feed amounted to $88 per head which was 78.1 percent 



28 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



of total costs. Two thousand seventy-six pounds of concentrates, 
principally corn, were fed per head at a cost of $52. Roughage fed 
per head amounted to 2,263 pounds valued at $30. Pasture was 
charged at actual cost or $6.47 per head. Man labor to care for one 
head of workstock for a year was 35.8 hours, which cost $9.89. Costs 
other than feed and man labor amounted to $14.95. A manure credit 
of $7.50 per head was deducted from total gross costs per head of 
$113, w^hich resulted in a net cost of $106 to keep one head of work- 
stock for a year. 

Since workstock worked only 46 days per head during the year, 
some attention should be given to utilizing workstock labor more 
efficiently.

Factors That Affect Costs and Returns 
Size of Business 

Size is an important factor that affects all business enterprise 
and particularly is this true of farming. Farm income and the family 
standard of living are largely determined by this factor. The size of 
a farm business can be measured in several ways. Number of acres 
operated, capital investment, crop acres, amount of labor used, num- 
ber of units comprising the major enterprises such as acres of cotton, 
number of milk cows in the herd, are measures commonly used. The 
more desirable measure to use in determining the size of a farm 
business depends a great deal on the type of farming followed. 

Some of the measures used to show the size of the 40 farm busi- 
nesses are shown in table 16. Acres per farm for all farms averaged 
170, with a total investment of $10,743. Cotton-dairy farms had 
more total acres, cotton acres, crop acres, and a larger investment than 
the dairy-cotton or dairy & cotton farms. This could be expected 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 29 



since emphasis was placed on cropping. As a whole, cotton-dairy 
businesses were the largest, dairy-cotton farms next, and the dairy 
& cotton farms the smallest. 

When considering the size of business in the Northeast Prairie, 
Northeast Highland, and Pontotoc Ridge Soil Areas, it will be noticed 
that the Prairie farms ranked highest in all measures. (Table 16). 
The Northeast Highland Area was next in all measures and the 
Pontotoc Ridge Area was the lowest in all measures.

Man work units.^ Since man labor is a common denominator of 
all farms, table 17 was constructed to show the relation of man work 
units per farm to and among other important factors. As the man 
work units per farm increased, the number of cows increased, acres 
of cotton increased very pronouncedly, and labor income increased. 
Costs and returns and the efficiency in the use of labor are not shown 
in this table because the averages for these important casual factors 
were found to be significantly different for the three types of farm- 
ing; namely, dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton. 

Number of cows. When considering the relation of the number 
of milk cows per farm to production, costs and returns, the relation- 
ships were not altogether consistent. (See table 18.) The five smallest 
herds had the highest production per cow, the lowest cost per 100 
pounds of milk, and the highest return per hour of labor. However, 
it should be pointed out that after getting away from these small 
herds, man hours per cow did decrease, and the labor return per hour 
spent on cows increased, as the number of milk cows in the herd in- 
creased.

The same relationship was obtained when all 40 of the farms 
were likewise considered. A larger number of cases would no doubt 
show a more direct relationship between the size of herd and other 
important factors. 

Acres of cotton. Acres of cotton per farm varied considerably. 
(See table 19.) 

Labor requirements increased per 500-pound bale produced as 
the acres of cotton per farm increased on farms that grew more than 
10 acres. Under increasing mechanization conditions the reverse 
of this relationship would be expected. However, practically all of 
the cotton production on the 32 farms was performed by man and 
horse labor. Thus it would appear that labor is being used less ef- 
ficiently on the larger farms. The same relationship exists when 
considering cotton-dairy farms alone. 

Larger farms have more cropper tenants, and according to data 
presented in table 19, such labor is no't as efficient as the labor 
furnished by the operator, members of his family, and the small 
amount of labor hired during the year on the smaller farms. Labor 
income increases as the size of the cotton enterprise increases, but 
labor income does not necessarily reflect efficient use of cropper 
labor on farms when considering the size of the business.

Labor Efficiency 

Using labor to the best advantage is one of the most important 
problems with which farm operators deal. Labor requirements are 
much greater for some enterprises than for others, and at the same 
time, the demands on all farms for labor is highly seasonal, particular- 
ly for crops. Labor requirements for crops constitute the largest 
cost item in their production. For cotton, this cost amounts to 60.5 
percent of the total expenses of growing the crop. Labor require- 
ments for corn, hay, and other crops were somewhat less, but still 
were the highest single cost item. 

Work units per man available on farms. The amount of labor 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 31 



accomplished per man varied from farm to farm, and as the available 
man equivalent per farm increased, the units worked per man avail- 
able decreased. (See table 20.) Also, as the available man equivalent 
per farm increased, the acres of cropland per farm increased. Farms 
v^ith an average of 38 acres of cropland had an average of 1.63 man 
equivalent of labor available. 

Since the amount of work accomplished per man available for 
work on the farm decreased as the size of business (measured by crop 
acres) increased, farmers operating large acreages should give more 
attention to using more efficiently the labor they have available under 
their management. It will be noticed that the acres of cropland per 
man did not vary much whether on a small farm or a large farm, yet 
the cost to produce an acre of cotton, or a pound of cotton, was greater 
as the size of farm business increased, and as the labor performed 
per man available decreased. The fact that larger farms had the 
most tenants, and since it was on these farms that labor was used less 
efficiently, this would tend to explain the unfavorable relationship of 
cropland per man and the greater cost of producing cotton on the 
larger farms. 

Man hours per cow. The amount of labor used per cow ranged 
from 86 hours to 262 hours, and the average amount of man labor 
per cow was 145 hours for the 40 farms. (See table 21.) There was 
practically no relationship between hours used per cow and the amount 
of milk produced per cow. However, as man hours expended per cow, 
increased, the cost to produce 100 pounds of milk increased, and the 
labor return per hour decreased. Thus the labor used per cow should 
be kept at a minimum in keeping with the ability of the cow to pro- 
duce milk. While feed is the most expensive cost item in the produc- 
tion of milk, the labor cost ranks next and much careful attention 
should be given to its use.

1/ Man work units accomplished per man available was determined by dividing 
the total hours of productive work accomplished per farm by the man equivalent of 
labor found on the farm. The operator and man cropper tenants were considered 
as one man each available for 12 months of work. Family labor of the operator 
and family labor of the man cropper were converted to the equivalent of man labor.

varied very much also. (See table 22.) Seven farms averaged only 
77 man hours per acre while a like number of farms averaged 168 
hours. As the man hours per acre increased, the pounds of cotton 
produced per acre increased, v^hich was unlike the relationship of 
labor expended per cow and the milk produced per cow. However, 
as the pounds of cotton per acre and labor per acre increased, the cost 
to produce an acre of cotton increased. Unlike the application of 
labor to cows, as labor on cotton per acre increased, the cost to pro- 
duce one pound of lint decreased and the labor return per hour in- 
creased up to 150 hours per acre and then decreased. Consequently, 
a farmer should be very careful about increasing the hours of labor 
used per cow and the labor used per acre of cotton above 150 hours 
under conditions similar to those on the 40 farms in Northeast Mis- 
sissippi. The part of his total time as operator of the farm that 
should be devoted to the entire dairy enterprise is another problem 
and should be considered in the organization of the entire farm 
business.

Rates of Production 

Again the reader might be reminded that the 40 farms keeping 
records in 1944 were divided into three groups or types: (1) dairy- 
cotton farms where there was a relatively high number of milk cows 
per farm compared with acres in cotton ; (2) cotton-dairy farms where 
the reverse of (1) above was true; and (3) dairy & cotton farms 
where the number of milk cows and acres in cotton per farm were 
about the same. 

Types of farming and rates of production. In table 23 the types 
of farms were listed according to the pounds of milk produced per 
cow. Farms placing the most emphasis on cotton (cotton-dairy 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 33 



farms) kept cows which had the lowest production, or 3,400 pounds 
each. Farms where major emphasis was placed on the dairy enter- 
prise (dairy-cotton farms) kept cows that produced an average of 
4,000 pounds each. And farms which placed about the same empha- 
sis on both dairy and cotton enterprises kept milk cows that produced 
an average of 4,400 pounds of milk each.

There was little relationship between the amount of milk produced 
per cow and the size of herd or the amount of concentrates fed per 
cow. Roughages fed per cow decreased as milk production increased 
and labor used per cow followed the same trend. It will be noticed 
that where there was a balance between number of cows and acres of 
cotton per farm that labor per cow was the lowest and milk production 
per cow was the highest. This made for more profitable milk pro- 
duction as shown in table 24.

The cost to keep a cow for one year decreased by types of farming 
as the production per cow increased among the types. (See table 24.) 
Cost per cow was $148 on cotton-dairy farms, $138 on dairy-cotton 
farms, and $133 on dairy & cotton farms. Cost of producing 100 
pounds of milk on dairy & cotton farms was the lowest, amounting 
to $2.83. The cost on dairy-cotton and cotton-dairy farms per 100 
pounds of milk was $3.27 and $4.09, respectively. Farmers who 
placed major emphasis on producing cotton and minor emphasis on 
producing milk lost an average of $7 per cow. Dairy-cotton farms 
made a profit of $36 per cow, and dairy & cotton farmers made $42 
on each cow kept. Likewise, the return per hour for labor used on 
milk cows was highest on dairy & cotton farms, amounting to $0.61. 
Labor return per hour for this enterprise on dairy-cotton and cotton- 
dairy farms was $0.47 and $0.22, respectively. 

Milk per cow. A study of the dairy enterprise on farms in 
Northeast Mississippi finds, as in similar studies elsewhere, that low 



34 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



producing cows are not profitable and that as production per cow 
increases, profits per cow increase. 

Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds of milk per year showed 
a loss of $15.75 per year, whereas cows producing an average of 5,438 
pounds netted the farmer $44. (See table 25.) Only four farms had 
cows producing below 3,000 pounds. The yearly cost to keep a cow 
increased as the amount of milk per cow increased. (See table 26.) 
It cost $124 per year to keep a cow producing an average of 2,575 
pounds, and it cost $175 to keep a cow that averaged 5,438 pounds. 
Thus the cost to produce approximately an extra 3,000 pounds of 
milk above the average production of the low producing cows was $51. 
That is the same as stating that farmers who kept cows that produced 
above 5,000 pounds, produced the last 3,000 pounds of milk at a cost 
of $1.70 per hundred.

Feed costs per cow increased as production increased, and the 
cost to produce 100 pounds of milk decreased. Profit per cow in- 
creased as production per cow increased. The cost to produce milk 
with a cow producing 5,000 pounds was 31 percent less than with a 
cow producing 2,500 pounds, and the labor return per cow was 500 
percent greater for 5,500-pounds production cows.

Concentrates fed per cow increased as production increased. 
Likewise, the cost to keep a cow for one year increased. There was 
no relationship between production per cow and man hours used 
per cow. 

Cost to produce 100 pounds of milk was $4.51 for farmers having 
cows that produced 2,575 pounds annually. Whereas, the cost was 
$3.11 per 100 pounds on farms having cows that averaged 5,438 
pounds. Labor returns per hour spent on milk cows increased as the 
milk produced per cow increased. Again, it might be pointed out 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 35 



that though the farmers with the lowest producing cows made a minor 
profit per cow, they had a labor return of $14 per cow. Assuming 
the farmer could not use his labor more profitably on some other en- 
terprise, and though his cows were low producers, his cows did pay 
all expenses other than labor and gave the farmer a return of $14 
per head as part payment for the labor he spent on them during the 
year. Labor return per cow was $85 where cows averaged producing 
above 5,000 pounds of milk. 

Milk per coiv by types of farming. The highest producing cows 
were not found on farms that placed major emphasis on keeping milk 
cows, but were found on the dairy & cotton type of farm. (See table 
27.) Concentrates fed per cow producing milk at various levels varied 
considerably among the three types of farms. However, the general 
trend was an increase in the feeding of concentrates per cow as the 
production increased. There was less relationship of this trend 
among cotton-dairy farms. 

It will be noticed that on cotton-dairy farms it was only when 
milk production reached the 5,000-pound mark that these farmers 
received a profit per cow. The cost of 100 pounds of milk increased 
as production per cow increased for dairy & cotton farms, which is 
inconsistent with each of the other types of farms and when all 40 
farms are likewise considered. This may be due to the feeding of 
considerably more concentrates to the cows producing above the 
3,000-pound level on the dairy & cotton farms. Also, it is quite 
possible for the cost to produce 100 pounds of milk to increase as 
production increased, but at a lesser rate and thereby show a favor- 
able return.

Pounds of cotton per acre. The production of cotton per acre 
ranged from 196 pounds to 837 when considering all farms. Seventy- 
five percent of all farms growing cotton had an average yield above 
400 pounds per acre and 44 percent of the farms producing cotton had 
a yield above 500 pounds. (See table 28.) 

As production per acre increased, man hours and total cost per 
acre increased. Likewise, profit per acre and labor return per hour 
increased. The farmers who produced above 770 pounds per acre 
received nearly one dollar per hour for their labor used on cotton.

Pounds of cotton per acre by types of farming. All types of 
farming showed an increase in man hours required per acre, total 
costs per acre, and profit per acre as the pounds of cotton produced 
per acre increased. (See table 29.) It was previously pointed out 
that man labor was the greatest cost item in the production of cotton 
amounting to 60 percent of total costs. This cost is shown by types 
of farming as related to pounds of cotton per acre for land, man labor 
and other factors. 

Where there was much emphasis placed on producing cotton 
(cotton-dairy farms), both land and labor costs increased as produc- 
tion increased up to where the average production was 604 pounds 
per acre, and then decreased as production went higher. This re- 
lationship was not obtained for the other types of farms. A larger 
number of cases might have given the same relationship. The lack 
of a sufficient number of farms in each class interval or grouping, 
should be considered before attempts are made to draw conclusions. 

The total cost to produce one pound of lint cotton on dairy & 
cotton farms decreased rather definitely as the yield per acre in- 
creased. This trend was not as consistent on the other two types of 
farms. The relation between increased yields per acre and labor 
returns per hour spent on cotton was fairly direct.

Dairy-cotton farmers received less for their labor when using it 
on cotton than did cotton-dairy and dairy & cotton farms. Low 
yields were partially responsible for this. Dairy & cotton farms re- 
ceived a labor return of 81 cents; cotton-dairy farms, 61 cents; and 
dairy-cotton farms, 49 cents for each hour spent in producing cotton. 
It should be noticed that the return per hour for labor used producing 
cotton was greater for those farms where there was a fairly well 
balanced emphasis on dairying and cotton. Likewise, this type of 
farming produced cotton at the lowest cost and received the highest 
profit per acre of cotton raised. 

Types of Farming 

The yield of cotton per acre varied considerably on the 32 farms 
producing it. Table 30 shows this variation by types of farming. 
Cotton-dairy farms grew four times the acreage of cotton as was 
grown on dairy-cotton farms and a little more than three times the 
amount grown on dairy & cotton farms. The yield per acre was 
slightly more than a bale per acre on both cotton-dairy and dairy & 
cotton farms, whereas the yield was only two-thirds bale per acre on 
dairy-cotton farms.

The cost of producing a pound of cotton varied little between 
types of farms, but varied considerably between individual farms. 
The cost per pound on dairy-cotton and cotton-dairy farms was 13.3 
and 13.5 cents, respectively. The cost to produce a pound of cotton 
on dairy & cotton farms was 12.4 cents, or one cent less than for the 
other farm types. The range in cost to produce a pound of cotton 
on the 32 farms was from 6.67 cents to 21.16 cents. Seventy-five 
percent of the farms produced cotton at a cost range from 10 to IG 
cents per pound with an average cost of 13.3 cents for all farms. 

Labor returns per hour spent on cotton averaged 63 cents for the 
32 farms. Low yields per acre undoubtedly account for the low labor 
return on dairy-cotton farms. On the other hand, yields were ap- 
proximately the same for cotton-dairy and dairy & cotton farms. 
Yet, the returns per hour of labor on dairy & cotton farms was 33 
percent higher than on dairy-cotton farms. This difference was due 
largely to the fact that the cotton-dairy farms used 31 hours more 
labor per acre, or 26 percent more than was used by dairy & cotton 
farms. 

Combination of Enterprises 

The combination of crops and animal enterprises for 39 farms 
and for the three types of farming in Northeast Mississippi are shown 
in table 31. The most important crop enterprises were cotton, corn, 
and hay. Corn and hay were grown for livestock feed. Hay was 
a cash crop on two farms. 

Cotton and milk cows are the major income enterprises on farms 
in Northeast Mississippi, and anything affecting these two enterprises 
plays an important role in determining the well-being of farmers in 
this area. The most profitable combination of cotton and milk cows 
and contributing enterprises constitutes a question that has not been 
satisfactorily answered in the area under study. 

Generally, a farmer receives the most of his income from the 
farm enterprise on which he spends the most of his labor. The 
average farm had 14.2 milk cows on which 205 ten-hour days of pro- 
ductive work were spent. Also, farms producing cotton had an 
average of 21.8 acres in that crop on which 307 ten-hour days of 
productive work were spent. Thus 49 percent more labor was used 
on the cotton enterprise than on the dairy enterprise for all farms.

All farms produced milk for the market. Only 32 farms pro- 
duced cotton. Therefore, for eight farms, the sale of milk was the 
only source of cash income except for miscellaneous sales of surplus 
stock, eggs and feed, which contributed considerably to labor income 
on some farms. All of the farms sold surplus livestock such as calves 
and heifers, eggs, hens, hogs, and a few sold some hay and corn. 
Labor income for eight farms in the dairy-cotton farm group not 
producing cotton was 73 percent of average labor income for the entire 
group of dairy-cotton farms. In other words, farms including cotton 
in their farm program along with milk cows in this type of farming 
had a larger labor income. However, profit per herd on the eight 
farms depending on cows for their cash income was $883, or 33 
percent above the average herd profit of $665 for dairy-cotton farms ; 
and more than twice as much profit per herd as for the 40 farms, 
which was $370. 

Type of farming related to enterprise profits. Farms placing 
major emphasis on cotton lost $7 per cow annually and $89 per herd. 
But they made a profit of $38 per acre on cotton and a profit of $1,516 
on the cotton enterprise. (See table 32.) Farms placing about the 
same emphasis on both milk cows and cotton received the greatest 
return per cow and per acre of cotton. Labor income was slightly 
higher than for the other types of farming — dairy-cotton and cotton- 
dairy. Since the dairy & cotton farms were slightly smaller than 
dairy-cotton farms, and only about 50 percent as large as cotton-dairy 
farms, it appears that much attention should be given to the desir- 
ability of organizing farms so that major emphasis is placed on both 
the cotton and dairy enterprises in the area of this study.

Weather conditions were very favorable in Northeast Mississippi 
to cotton production in 1944 and only fair for feed crops and pastures. 
These conditions should be considered when making an appraisal of 
the results of this report. The fact that cotton-dairy farms with a 
larger investment did not make a larger labor income was due to the 
loss they sustained on their dairy herds and to using farm labor less 
efficiently. 

Combination of enterprises on high and loiv income farms, A 
comparison of enterprises on farms found in the upper one-third labor 
income group ($2,444) and the lowest one-third labor income group 
($416) of the farms under study is also given in table 31. Crop acres 
were 85.7 for the upper income group and 47.2 acres for the low in- 
come group with an average of 61.3 acres for all farms. Thus, the 
size of business looms up as an important factor affecting income. 
Cotton acreage in the upper one-third income group was more than 
twice as great as in the lowest one-third income group, whereas milk 
cows were only three less in the low income group than in the upper 
income group. Forty-one percent of the crop acreage on the low 
income farms was in hay and 27 percent was in hay on the upper 
income group. 

Combination of enterprises on high and lotv cost farms. The 
combination of enterprises on farms producing cotton and milk at 
the highest and lowest costs per pound of lint and per 100 pounds of 
milk are shown in table 33. The 10 farms producing cotton at the 
lowest cost, or 9.44 cents per pound, had 14.3 acres in cotton, and the 
10 high-cost farms — 16.99 cents per pound — had 16.3 acres in cotton. 
The difference in acreage was not significant. However, acres of 
cotton produced on the highest-milk-cost farms ($4.51 per 100 
pounds) were twice as many as were found on the 10 farms produc- 
ing milk at the lowest cost, or at $2.30 per 100 pounds. 

The difference in the emphasis placed on milk cows and other 
livestock on high and low cost farms for both cows and cotton (table 
33) was of little significance, which means that the difference in milk 
costs due to other factors such as the capacity of cow, feeding 
practices, time of calving, pasture per cow, efficient use of labor, and 
emphasis placed on other enterprises. The fact that the 9 farms 
producing milk at the highest cost had twice the acreage of cotton 
as was found on the 10 farms producing milk at the lowest cost, bears 
out earlier findings that milk was produced less efficiently on farms 
giving major emphasis to cotton.

The number of milk cows on the 10 farms producing cotton at ^.he 
lowest cost and the 10 farms producing cotton at the highest cost 
were practically the same. Likewise, acres per farm in cotton vere 
about the same. However, the 10 farms producing cotton at the 
lowest cost, produced an average of 114 pounds per acre more than 
on the 10 farms producing cotton at the highest cost. The farms 
producing cotton at the lowest cost kept cows that produced more 
milk by 370 pounds than was the production per cow on farms produc- 
ing cotton at the highest cost. 

The 10 farms producing milk at the lowest cost kept cows that 
averaged 4,470 pounds of milk each, whereas the average production 
per cow on the 9 highest cost farms was 3,811 pounds — an annual 
difference of 659 pounds. On the other hand, the yield of cotton was 
greatest per acre on farms with the highest milk production costs. 
This again points out the fact that milk was produced less efficiently 
on farms placing the most emphasis on cotton. Also, it has been 
shown that labor is used less efficiently on farms with a large acreage 
of cotton. 

SoU Fertility 

Detail soil maps for each of the 40 farms in this study were 
furnished by the Soil Conservation Service of Mississippi and the 
Bureau of Plant Industry. These maps were used to study in detail 
the soil types on each farm. A staff member of the Experiment 
Station Soils Department assisted in this work by making a visit to 
each farm to study the types of soils with special emphasis on the 
fertility and adaptability of crops to the soils on which they were 
being grown. Farms were then classed as high, medium, and low 
in fertility for the purpose of finding relationships between farms of 
different fertility levels and the costs of production and income. 



42 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Soil fertility related to costs and returns. Half of the farms in 
the Black Prairie Area were classed high in fertility. One-half of 
the farms in the Northeast Highland Area were low in fertility, and 
85 percent of the farms in the Pontotoc Ridge Area also were classed 
low in fertility. 

For the areas as a whole, the cdst to produce one pound of cotton 
increased as soil fertility decreased. (See table 34.) The difference 
in costs between farms of high fertility and low fertility was ap- 
proximately two cents per pound. With a market price of 20 cents 
for cotton, a spread of 2 cents per pound amounts to $10 per bale. 
Interest at 5 percent on an investment of $200 amounts to $10. Con- 
sequently, a farmer can afford to pay considerably more for land of 
high fertility when purchasing land for the purpose of growing 
cotton. The rate of cotton production was greater on farms of high 
soil fertility, as would be expected. This, of course, was a major 
factor in influencing the smaller cost of producing a pound of cotton 
y)n these farms. •

Soil fertility related to various factors. The foregoing soil 
fertility cost relationship for the 32 farms were the same for the Black 
Prairie Area except that the difference between cost of producing a 
pound of cotton on high and low fertility farms was greater. (See 
table 35.) In the Pontotoc Ridge and Northeast Highland Areas, the 
same general relationship existed. However, the value of these find- 
ings is limited by the few farms in this study located in the Northeast 
Highland Area and in the better grades of land in the Pontotoc 
Ridge Area.

Farms high in fertility produced an average of 508 pounds of lint 
cotton per acre, but both medium and low fertility farms produced 
well above 400 pounds per acre. (See table 36.) 

Profit per acre of cotton decreased as soil fertility decreased. 
Farms of low fertility spent more for fertilizer per acre than did 
farms of medium fertility, yet received less profit per acre. Labor 
income was inconsistent in its relationship to soil fertility; however, 
labor income on farms of low fertility was much less than labor in- 
come on farms of medium and high fertility.

Soil Crop Adaptation 

Growing a crop on the type of soil to which it is best adapted 
usually gives the highest labor returns. Progressive farm operators 
give much thought to placing crops in their farm layouts so that this 
relationship exists. Table 37 shows the relationship of the adaptation 
of crops to soils on the 40 farms in this study. On 22 farrrs the 
adaptation of crops to soils on which they were grown was "good"; 
on 14 farms, "fair" ; and on 4 farms it was "poor". The adaptation 
of crops to soils on the farm as a whole was used as a basis for the 
above classification.

The rate of production was highest where soil crop adaptation 
was good. It cost 12.42 cents to produce a pound of lint cotton where 
adaptation was good, 15.05 cents where it was fair, and 15.17 cents 
where adaptation was poor. The cost to produce a bushel of corn 
was 94 cents where soil crop adaptation was good, $1.10 where it was 
fair, and $1.41 where soil crop adaptation was poor. The cost of 
producing cotton per pound was 23 percent greater on farms with poor 
soil crop adaptation than on farms when the soil crop adaptation was 
good. It cost 50 percent more to produce corn on farms where the 
soil crop adaptation was poor than where the soil crop adaptation 
was good. Also, it will be observed that labor return per hour spent 
on cotton was 73 cents where soil crop adaptation was good, 61 cents 



44 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



where it was fair, and 54 cents on farms where it was poor. Labor 
income was highest on farms where soil crop adaptation was good 
and lowest on farms with poor soil crop adaptation. 

Milk Production by Seasons 

Seasonal fluctuation of the production of milk was trczn3ndously 
great on a large majority of the farms. This variation in the amount 
of milk produced per cow^ from season to season, or from winter to 
summer, is due primarily to the seasonality of pasture production and 
breeding practices as well as to feeding practices. Since few farmers 
grow winter pastures and with many feeding lightly in the winter, 
milk production is piled up from April to September. In fact, 64 
percent of the milk produced by 571 cows on 40 farms was produced 
from April to September, or in just 50 percent of the year. Figure 2 
\shows the monthly trend of total milk sold on the 40 farms as well 
Vs the trend for the monthly butterfat test. 

\ This great fluctuation in milk production during the year affects 
vftry little the efficient operation of the farm business as they are now 
oWnized, since the labor spent on a cow varies only a small amount 
fr^m season to season. On the other hand, milk processing plants 
are faced with a very difficult problem. Since their equipment, 
which represents a relatively large investment, is used only for pro- 
ces^ng whole milk, these plants are forced to carry equipment and 
labo^ necessary for capacity production for less than 6 months during 
the j^^ar and then operate much under capacity for a large portion of 
the y^ar. Should the milk plants in the area shut down during their 
slack season, there would be no market outlet for farmers producing 
milk, which would be disastrous to the dairy business. Yet most 
dairy larmers permit their cows to virtually shut down in production 
during the winter months and expect milk plants running at one- 
fourth capacity or less to continue operation. 

Seasonal production related to costs and returns. Thirteen 
farms milked cows that produced for sale during the months of Janu- 
ary, February, and March, only 146 pounds each per month. (See 
table 38.) That was less than % gallon daily per cow. For the 40 
farms as a whole, the average daily amount sold per cow in the months 
of January, February, and March was only 7.3 pounds of milk. That 
was less than 1 gallon per day. Cows producing above 5,000 pounds 
for sale during the year averaged 11.6 pounds of milk per day in the 
first quarter of the year and reached a production of slightly less 
than 2 gallons per day in the months of July, August, and September

— their highest producing quarter. Milk sold per cow, on the aver- 
age, was 1.3 pounds per day less than was produced. This amount 
was consumed by the family or by calves. Cows producing less than 
5,000 pounds of milk sold per year reached their peak of daily produc- 
tion in the second quarter of the year. 

Figure 3 shows the trend of milk sold monthly per cow in each 
of the quarters of the year, as well as the labor return per hour for 
labor used on milk cows. Increase in production for the second 
quarter of the year was rather abrupt. The increase for cows pro- 
ducing below 3,000 pounds sold annually was approximately 90 per- 
cent, and over 100 percent for cows producing from 3 to 4 thousand 
pounds. This increase in the springtime was not as great for cows 
above the 4,000-pound mark. It is showm further that production 
per cow declined gradually from the second quarter to the third 
quarter, except when more than 5,000 pounds were sold per cow, and 
then dropped precipitously in the fourth quarter, reversing the move- 
ment in the spring months. 

Figure 2 shows the monthly trend of total milk sold on the 40 
farms as well as the trend for the monthly percent butterfat test. 
This monthly trend of milk sold coincides closely with pasture con- 
ditions. It should be noticed that cows producing from 340 to 350 
pounds of salable milk monthly in January, February, and March, 
which is approximately 1.3 gallons per day, gave a labor return of 
more than twice as much per hour as was given by cows producing 
an average of 146 pounds per month. 

Cows producing below 3,000 pounds of market milk per year 
and dropping very low in winter production, produced milk at a cost 
of $3.88 per 100 pounds with a labor return of $0.25 per hour. Cows 
producing from 4,000 to 5,000 pounds of market milk annually pro- 
duced it at a cost of $3.41 per 100 pounds and gave a labor return 
of $0.58 cents per hour. 

Farm Practices 

Practices followed by farmers in operating their businesses are 
very important in the effect upon costs and income and the profitable- 
ness of the farm as a whole. Farmers often follow different practices 
and get practically the same results. If the results are good, then 
both practices may be good under the given conditions. However, 
if farmers are using poor practices, results obtained very seldom give 
pleasure and profit in the business. 

Practices followed in feeding cows varied from farm to farm 
giving varying results. Records of these methods of feeding show 
that the combination of feeds and the capacity of cows to convert feed 
materials into milk play a greater part in profitable milk production 
than do mere quantities of feed. A few farmers feed for winter 
production and may feed to keep their cows alive until spring grass 
comes. Others feed for winter production and then practically quit 
feeding when the cows begin to get a few nibbles of grass in the spring. 
A few dairymen are beginning to provide winter grazing by planting 
oats, or other winter crops. All indications point to the need for a 
more detailed study of feeding practices by dairymen under actual 
farm conditions.

Producing milk for the winter market. Farmers milking cows 
that have a relatively high production in the winter when compared 
with those having a low production in the winter months, produce 
milk more cheaply and receive the largest return per cow. Line 
graphs of monthly production per cow when production was low and 
when relatively high in winter months are shown in figure 4. 

Low winter producers had an average production of only 121 
pounds in January, or 4 pounds per day. Their production was 165 
and 158 pounds, respectively, for November and December, and 160 
pounds for February. Their peak production of 425 pounds per 
month was reached in May. Production for low winter producers 
almost doubled in the 2-month period of September and October. 

When winter production was relatively high, the average produc- 
•tion per cow for January was 392 pounds, or 13 pounds per day. 
Low winter producers gave less than V2 gallon of milk per day, which 
indicates that the low producers were practically dry. 

The yearly per day cost of keeping the average cow on the five 
farms where production of milk was low in winter months was $0.29. 
The yearly per day market value of the milk produced on these same 
farms was 3.72 cents per pound. With a cow producing 4 pounds 
per day, the daily value of milk per cow was 14.88 cents. Thus the 
average cow on the five farms where Tvinter production was low was 
kept at a loss of about 15 cents per day during January. The loss 
per day would have been greater if the daily cost had been determined 
for the month of January. This unfavorable situation continued 
through February and on into the spring months until production 
increased sufficiently to equal cost of production. In the fall months, 
production dropped to the point where daily costs per cow for the 
months of October, November, and December were greater than the 
daily value of milk produced. 

On the other hand, the yearly per day cost to keep the average 
cow on the five farms where production of milk was relatively high 
per cow in the winter months was 39.7 cents. The yearly per day 
market value of the milk produced on those same farms was 3.85 
cents per pound, and with a cow producing 13 pounds of milk per day 
in January, the daily value of milk produced was 50.1 cents. There- 
fore, the average cow on the five farms where venter milk production

Figure 4. Five farms with very low winter milk production per cow, and five 
farms with relatively high winter production per cow related to various factors, 1944. 

Milk production per month for 571 cows increased 117 percent from January to 
May and decreased 50 per cent from July to November. This fluctuation in milk 
makes it very difficult for milk plants to operate efficiently throughout the year. 
Also, it creates a problem for milk truckmen. Since more winter production usually 
results in higher profit per cow, farmers need to consider more seriously the prob- 
lem of seasonal production. 



50 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



was relatively high was kept at a gain of 10.4 cents per day. Thia 
gain was above all costs including labor. 

On farms where winter production per cow was low, the amount 
of milk produced per cow during the year was 1,733 pounds less than 
the amount produced by cows relatively high in winter production. 
(Figure 3.) Concentrates fed per cow were considerably less on the 
low-winter production farms. They did feed, however, a little more 
roughage per cow than was fed on high winter production farms. 
Profit per cow was three times greater and labor returns per hour 
used on cows was twice as great on farms where winter production 
per cow was relatively high. Also, the cost to produce 100 pounds of 
milk was 53 cents less on those farms. The foregoing shows that it 
was much more profitable to keep cows producing relatively high in 
the winter months as well as during summer. 

Cotton production with and without sharecroppers. Thirty-two 
of the 40 farms on which records were kept produced cotton. Eight 
of these farms did not have sharecroppers. The work was done by 
the operator and members of the family, by swapping labor with 
neighbors, ^nd by hiring a small amount of cash labor in rush periods. 

Farms with sharecroppers produced nearly four times as many 
acres of cotton as were produced by farms without sharecroppers. 
(See table 40.) The cost to produce one acre of cotton was greater 
where sharecroppers were used, but this was due principally to the 
high cost of labor which was paid with one-half of the cotton crop and 
to less efficient use of this labor on the larger farms. 1944 was a 
very favorable year for producing cotton in Northeast Mississippi, 
and the half of the cotton crop going to the tenant as payment for his 
labor explains to a large extent the difference in cost per acre. Labor 
on farms without croppers was valued at the current rate paid labor 
without lodging and meals.

Labor returns per hour spent on cotton for sharecropper farms 
were slightly above the labor returns on farms where there were no 
sharecroppers. The larger yield on farms with sharecroppers con- 
tributed to this difference. Farms with sharecroppers had soils 
with higher fertility and better soil-crop adaptation, all of which was 
a contributing factor affecting labor returns. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 51 



Summary 

This study was based on farm records kept by 40 farmers in 5 
counties of Northeast Mississippi for the year 1944. Farms were 
selected in the Black Prairie, Northeast Highland, and Pontotoc 
Ridge soil areas, and were further selected on the basis of emphasis 
placed on milk cows and cotton. 

The average acreage per farm was 170 with cropland amounting 
to 44 percent. Open, tillable pasture amounted to 25 percent of all 
land, and open non-tillable land represented 12 percent. 

Milk cows were the most numerous livestock on the average farm 
with 14 head each. The range in number was from 4 to 40. 

The average investment per farm was $10,743. Total real estate 
investment amounted to $38 per acre and livestock, equipment, feeds, 
and miscellaneous supplies amounted to $25.20, which gave a total 
farm investment of $63.20 per acre. Average farm receipts amount- 
ed to $5,930 ; farm expenses were $3,973, and the average labor income 
was $1,420 per farm. 

Milk was produced for sale on all farms. There was an average 
of 14 milk cows per farm with an annual production each of 3,931 
pounds. The feed cost was 59.6 percent of the total cost of producing 
100 pounds of milk. Man labor amounted to 27.3 percent. The net 
farm cost to keep a cow for one year was $120.98, and the net farm 
cost to produce 100 pounds of milk was $3.08. With an average 
hauling charge of 25 cents per 100 pounds, the cost of 100 pounds 
delivered at the plant was $3.33. 

The cost of producing milk delivered at the plant on dairy-cotton, 
cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton farms was $3.27, $4.09, and $2.83, 
respectively. Similarly the profit per cow was $36, — $7, and $42. 
The average cost to keep a cow for 1 year on dairy-cotton farms was 
$120 ; on cotton-dairy farms, $130 ; and $113 on dairy & cotton farms. 
(Price received at plant.) It will be noticed that costs were least and 
labor returns were highest on dairy & cotton farms. 

Thirty-two farms produced cotton averaging 21.8 acres and 20.2 
bales ginned per farm. The average price received per pound of 
lint cotton was 21.21 cents, and the cost to produce one pound of lint 
was 13.28 cents. Man labor constituted 60.5 percent of the total 
cost to produce 1 pound of lint. An average of 141 hours of man 
labor was required on the 32 farms to grow 1 acre of cotton. On 
dairy-cotton farms, 112 hours of man labor were required to produce 
1 acre of cotton. On cotton-dairy farms, 151 hours were required, 
and dairy & cotton farms required 120 hours. The cost to produce 
a pound of lint cotton on dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton 
farms was 13.31 cents, 13.55 cents, and 12.42 cents, respectively. 

The cost to produce a bushel of corn was 95.5 cents; 100 pounds 
of live pork, $12.41 ; and the cost to keep one head of workstock for 
a year was $105.82. 



52 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Cotton-dairy farms had more total acres, cotton acres, crop acres, 
and a larger investment than the dairy-cotton or dairy & cotton 
farms. Farms in the Black Prairie soil area ranked highest in all 
measures of size of farm business. The Northeast Highland came 
second and the Pontotoc Ridge Area was third. 

As the man work units per farm increased, the number of cows 
increased, acres of cotton increased, and labor income increased. 
Labor returns per hour of labor increased as the number of cows in 
the herd increased. In general, as the acres in cotton per farm 
increased, the man hours of labor required to produce one bale in- 
creased. This seems to be due to the fact that as the size of the farm 
increased, the number of sharecroppers per farm increased, which 
indicates that sharecropper labor was used less efficiently. Also, 
as the man equivalent available for work on the farms increased, the 
units worked per man decreased. With man labor constituting 60.5 
percent of the cost of producing a pound of lint cotton, the efficient 
use of labor is of vital importance. Labor requirements per cow 
were lowest on dairy & cotton farms. 

Cotton-dairy farms kept the lowest producing cows and dairy 
& cotton farms kept the highest producers. There was little relation- 
ship between the amount of milk produced per cow and the size of 
the herd. Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds of milk per year 
showed a loss of $15.75 per head, whereas cows producing above 5,000 
pounds netted the farmers $44 each. The average annual produc- 
tion per cow for the 40 farms was 3,931 pounds, and production per 
cow on dairy & cotton farms was 4,392 ; on dairy-cotton farms, 3,993 
pounds ; and on cotton-dairy farms, 3,413 pounds. Farmers keeping 
cows that produced above 5,000 pounds produced the last 3,000 pounds 
of milk at a cost of $1.70 per hundred when compared with production 
per cow of less than 3,000 pounds. Labor returns per hour spent 
on milk cows increased as the milk produced per cow increased, and 
the annual labor return per cow was $85 where production averaged 
above 5,000 pounds. 

The production of lint cotton per acre ranged from 196 pounds 
to 837 pounds. Seventy-five percent of the farms producing cotton 
had an average yield of about 400 pounds per acre, and 44 percent 
had a production above 500 pounds per acre. All types of farming 
showed an increase in man hours required per acre, total costs per 
acre, and profit per acre as the pounds of cotton produced per acre 
increased. The yield was slightly more than a bale per acre on both 
cotton-dairy and dairy & cotton, and only 2/3 bale per acre on dairy- 
cotton farms. 

The principal combination of farm enterprises on farms was 
cotton, milk cows, corn and hay. Cotton and milk cows were the 
major income enterprises. Farms placing major emphasis on cotton 
lost $7 per milk cow, but made a profit of $38 per acre on cotton. 
Farms placing about the same emphasis on both cotton and milk 
cows received the greatest return per cow and per acre of cotton. 
Farms producing milk at the highest cost produced twice the acreage 
of cotton that was produced on low cost farms. Variations in the 
proportionate combinations of enterprises on farms producing cotton 
and milk at a high cost and a low cost (table 33) was not significant, 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 53 



except for the difference in cotton acreage, which would indicate that 
differences in costs were due more to such factors as capacity of 
cows, feeding practices, pasture per cow, quality of seed, amount of 
fertilizer used, soil fertility, labor efficiency and the managerial 
ability of the farmer. 

The cost to produce one pound of cotton increased as soil fer- 
tility decreased. The cost relationship was the same for each of 
the soil areas. 

The rate of crop production was highest where soil-crop adapta- 
tion was good. The cost of producing cotton per pound was 23 per- 
cent greater on farms with poor soil-crop adaptation than on farms 
where soil-crop adaptation was good. It cost 50 percent more to 
produce corn on farms where the soil-crop adaptation was poor than 
where it was good; and labor income was highest on farms where 
soil-crop adaptation was good, and lowest on farms with poor soil-crop 
adaptation. 

Sixty-four percent of the milk produced by 571 cows on 40 farms 
was produced from April to September, inclusive, or in one-half of 
the year. The daily average amount of milk sold per cow in the 
months of January, February, and March was 7.3 pounds, or less 
than 1 gallon. Milk production per month for the 571 cows increased 
117 percent from January to May, and decreased 50 percent from 
July to November. Cows producing below 3,000 pounds of market 
milk per year, and dropping very low in winter production, produced 
milk at a cost of $3.88 per 100 pounds with a labor return of 25 cents 
per hour. Cows producing from 4,000 to 5,000 pounds of market 
milk annually produced at a cost of $3.41 per 100 pounds and gave 
a labor return of $0.58 per hour. 

On five farms where milk production was lowest per cow in 
January, the average amount produced daily by each cow was 4 
pounds — less than 1/2 gallon. These same cows reached their peak 
production of 14 pounds of milk per day or 1.6 gallons in May. On 
five farms where winter production was relatively high, the average 
daily production per cow in January was 13 pounds. Low winter 
producers were kept at a loss of 15 cents per day in January, and 
relatively high winter producing cows were kept at a gain of 10.4 
cents per day. Profit per cow was three times as great and labor re- 
turns per hour were twice as great, on farms where winter production 
per cow was relatively high. 

The cost to produce one acre of cotton was greater where share- 
croppers were used, but this was due principally to the high cost of 
labor which was paid with one-half of the cotton crop and to less 
efficient use of this labor available on the larger farms. 



54 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Recommendations 

In summary, the findings of this study appear to suggest the 
following recommendations : 

Keep high producing coivs. Cows with a production below 3,000 
pounds gave an annual labor return of $14. On farms where produc- 
tion was above 5,000 pounds, the return was $85 per cow. 

Groiv cotton on soils of high fertility. The cost to produce cotton 
on farms of high soil fertility was 12.58 cents per pound, whereas the 
cost was 14.67 cents on farms of low soil fertility, or a cost spread of 
nearly 2 cents. This spread of cost between high and low fertility 
farms was nearly 4 cents per pound in the Black Prairie area. On 
land that produced between 700 and 800 pounds of lint per acre, the 
profit on each acre was $83. On land that produced between 200 and 
300 pounds of lint, the profit per acre was only $15. 

Use labor more efficiently. Cows on which 125 hours were 
spent gave a labor return of $0.56 per hour, and cows on which more 
than 200 hours were spent gave a labor return of only $0.18 per hour. 

The average cost to grow a pound of lint was 13.28 cents. Labor 
amounted to 8.04 cents of this cost, or 60.5 percent of the total cost to 
produce a pound of lint cotton. On farms where the average labor 
performed per man available was less than 100 days during the year, 
the man labor cost to produce 1 pound of lint cotton was 9.3 cents. 
Where the days of labor per man were 250 and above, the man labor 
cost was 5.2 cents per pound. 

Place major emphasis on both cotton and dairy enterprises. 
There is a definite place for both cotton and milk cows in the or- 
ganization of farms in Northeast Mississippi. This combination of 
enterprises permits more efficient use of labor and farm by-products, 
and cotton and dairy cows supplement each other by giving the farmer 
a higher return per hour for his labor. 

Labor return per hour spent on milk cows on dairy & cotton 
farms was $0.61. On dairy-cotton farms the returns were $0.47 
per hour and on cotton-dairy farms it was only $0.22 per hour. On 
dairy & cotton farms labor returns per hour spent on cotton was 
$0.81, whereas it was $0.49 and $0.61, respectively, on dairy-cotton 
and cotton-dairy farms. 

Groiv crops on soils to which they are best adapted. On farms 
where soil-crop adaptation was good, the cost to produce a pound of 
cotton was 12.42 cents, and the cost to produce a bushel of corn was 
$0.94. Where soil-crop adaptation was poor, the cost was 15.17 cents 
per pound for cotton and $1.41 per bushel of corn. 

Feed cows for winter production. Low winter producers gave 
a labor return of $0.35 per hour. Relatively high winter producers 
returned $0.72 per hour. 

Breed for tvinter production. Cows bred to calve in the late fall 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 55 



are available for their best flow of milk in the winter months as well 
as in the spring and early summer months. 

Reduce costs by increasing rates of production. Farms that 
produced cotton at the lowest cost had the highest yields, or 1.14 
five-hundred pound bales per acre, and farms producing cotton at 
the highest cost had the lowest yields or 0.78 five-hundred pound bale 
per acre. 

Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds of milk annually, pro- 
duced it at a cost of $4.51 per 100 pounds, and cows producing more 
than 5,000 pounds produced it at a cost of $3.11 per 100 pounds, or a 
difference of $1.40. 

. Large farms should use available labor more fully. Days of 
work (10-hour days) per man on farms with more than three man 
equivalents available averaged less than 125 for the year. Days of 
work per man on farms with 1.6 man equivalents available averaged 
310. 

Keep only workstock needed. The net cost to keep one head of 
workstock for a year was $106. 

Use workstock more efficiently. The average head of workstock 
was used only 46 ten-hour days during the year.

INTRODUCTION 

Forests are one of Mississippi's most important natural re- 
sources. About 54 percent of the land in the State or 16-1/2 million 
acres are devoted to forests. About 14 percent of the annual income 
in Mississippi is derived from forest products. Forests and related 
activities also contribute approximately 13.3 percent of the tax paid 
into the State Treasury. It is estimated that the average annual in- 
come from farm woodlands alone amounted to $16,890,000 during the 
period from 1941 to 1944. However, there are a great many farm 
forestry problems and thus a dire need for better woodland manage- 
ment throughout Mississippi. 

There are many evidences of existing problems and the need for 
better forestry practices. One of these is the fact that abuu*^ ^.700,000 
acres of forest land have burned, on the average, each year for the 
past 5 years. Another obvious condition is that only a very small 
percentage of farmers thin their forests or make improvement or 
liberation cuttings, nor do they harvest only the timber that is ready 
to harvest. In too many cases no cutting is done for several years 
and then everything is cut. In other words, clear cutting is too gen- 
erally practiced. Other unsatisfactory practices could be mentioned 
but the fact that the average annual growth per acre is only about 
100 board feet is evidence enough that better practices are needed. 
Forestry specialists estimate that the average production per acre 
per year of Mississippi's forests should be 300 board feet or better 
with the use of good forestry practices. 

Through chemical and other research, many new wood products 
and uses of forest products are being found each year. Many of 
these products are necessary and some are indispensible in everyday 
life. Thus, forests are becoming, from day to day, increasingly im- 
portant. 

With the realization, by agricultural leaders and farmers, of 
these facts, viz., that forests provide a good part of the farm income, 
that forest products are becoming more important, and that farm 
woodlands could be made to provide a much greater income, there has 
been an increasing demand for information on this subject. The 
amount of experimental information on farm forestry is somewhat 
limited, especially in Mississippi, when compared to some other agri- 
cultural products. However, an attempt is made in this bulletin to 
bring together results of many experiments and other information 
available that seem applicable to Mississippi conditions and con- 
dense it as much as possible and yet cover the subject of forestry so 
far as it relates to farm woodlands and practices. 

It is hoped that this information will be helpful to agricultural 
leaders in directing and teaching farmers and farm boys to use better 
forestry practices, thereby increasing their farm income.

PART I 

FOREST ECONOMY OF MISSISSIPPI 

This first section is written with the view of giving the technical 
agriculture workers in Mississippi a clearer insight of the importance 
of forestry in the State. The discussion on economic importance 
was taken largely from an article by the Mississippi Forest and 
Chemurgic Association. 

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 

Mississippi's first principal industry was that of manufacturing 
forest products. As a foundation of industry and as a source of em- 
ployment of our people, timber has continued to hold this foremost 
place to this day. In 1944, the sale value of finished forest products 
in Mississippi was $137,025,852, as revealed by the State Tax Com- 
mission. During this period some 60,000 Mississippians were em- 
ployed as industrial workers and many more thousands as woods and 
maintenance crews. 

TIMBER A MAJOR SOURCE OF INCOME TO THE RAILROADS 

Most of the railroads in Mississippi were built primarily for the 
moving of timber products, many are still dependent to a great extent 
on timber movements and some could not exist were it not for the 
revenues they receive from this source. 

The Interstate Commerce Commission records show that the 
class-one railroads operating in Mississippi originated in carload lots 
11,149,230 tons of revenue forest products in the years of 1943 and 
1944. This tonnage amounted to 45 percent of the total tonnage 
originated by these roads during this 24-month period. 

According to records of the Mississippi Public Service Com- 
mission, all railroads operating in Mississippi in 1944 originated 
in carload lots 6,079,050 tons of revenue forest products, which 
amounts to 47 percent of all carlot tonnage originating in the State 
in 1944. 

TIMBER CONTRIBUTES TO SUPPORT OF MANY OTHER 
BUSINESS ENTERPRISES 

Truck, automobile and gas businesses supported by timber opera- 
tions contribute millions of dollars to our State, County, and City 
Governments and furnish employment to many thousands of our 
citizens. Some operators and tax authorities state that the taxing 
units of the State receive more revenue from the automotive business 
engaged in timber operations than that received from the railroads' 
timber business. 

The State-wide distribution of forest income makes the most 
useful, versatile and stabilizing factors of the many manufacturinjr 
pursuits of the State. 

TIMBER AS A TAXPAYER 

How timber taxes affect the State Treasury, As revealed by the 
Manufacturers' Tax Division of the State Tax Commission the sales 
value of finished forest products manufactured in Mississippi from 



8 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



June 1, 1943, to December 31, 1944, a period of 19 months, was 
$216,957,608 or an average of $11,418,822 each month. This new 
money coming direct from the State's forests is worth millions to the 
State annually in the form of manufacturing and income taxes. 

During the past 41/2 years, Mississippi has produced approxi- 
mately 2,400,000,000 feet of forest products annually and information 
collected indicated that each thousand feet manufactured incurred a 
labor and handling cost of $40, which presents an annual payroll 
of some $96,000,000. 

From a sales tax standpoint, if this payroll were spent one time 
it would net the State $1,920,000. If it were spent four times, which 
seems to be the approximate turnover, it would net the State 
$7,680,000 in sales tax alone. To be safe in the calculation, it might 
be said that if half of the transaction of money spent is on items which 
carry no sales tax, there would still be an annual sales tax revenue 
to the State of $3,840,000. 

Timber operation taxes collected in 1944 by State Tax Commission 



Sales tax on labor earnings, turnover $3,840,000 

Manufacturers tax of 1/4 of 1 percent 342,564 

Severance tax 250,242 

Income tax on forests products 

Manulacturers 2,155,239 



Total $6,588,045 



Other taxes collected on timber operations of which definite 
amounts are unknown but considered 'to equal or surpass those cited 
above, are: 

JOBBERS AND WHOLESALERS TAX 1/8 OF 1 PERCENT. 
RETAIL SALES TAX ON FOREST PRODUCTS 2 PERCENT. 
INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX EARNED FROM TIMBER 
OPERATIONS. 

TAXES COLLECTED FROM RAILROADS IN PROPORTION 
FOR TONNAGE OF FOREST PRODUCTS MOVED. 

PRIVILEGE TAX ON WOOD USING PLANTS. 

ADVALOREM TAX ON PLANTS AND INVENTORY 
STOCKS. 

TAX ON TRUCKS, CARS AND MOTOR EQUIPMENT IN 
TIMBER OPERATIONS. 

The farm woodlands play an all important part in the over-all 
forest economy Mississippi as is shown in the following paragraph: 

According to the 1940 census about 54 percent of the total land, 
or 16,500,000 acres, was devoted to forest. The same census shows 
that of this acreage, farmers ow^ned 6,068,000 acres. A more recent 
survey of forest ownership in the South, including Mississippi, shows 
farm ownership to be approximately 10,000,000 acres. 

The Severance Tax Division of the State Tax Commission esti- 
mates that 80 percent of the total State production of forest products 
during the period 1941-1945 came from farm woodlands. On this 
basis, and using the 2,400,000,000 board feet annual cut production 
figures for Mississippi for that period, the farmers produced 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI

1,920,000,000 board feet of forest products each year from 1941 to 
1944. 

If it had been possible for all the farmers to deliver these forest 
products to the rail head, the average price received v^ould have been 
about $20 per thousand in the log or a total of $38,400,000 annually. 
It is estimated that 80 percent of the farmers sold their timber on the 
stump at an average price of $6 per thousand or a total of $9,210,000. 
The remaining 20 percent delivered their products to the market and 
at an estimated price of $20 per thousand, or a total of about 
$7,680,000. Adding these two figures together the farmers of Mis- 
sissippi have received approximately $16,890,000 annually from 1941 
to 1945 for forest products. Whereas, as already stated, they might 
have received over $38,000,000 if all of them could have delivered 
their products to the market. It should be pointed out that the 20 per- 
cent who delivered their products to market received more than 80 
percent as much for their products as the remaining 80 percent of the 
farmers received for theirs on the stump. Of course, it may not be 
possible for all farmers to deliver their forest products to the market 
but the difference in the prices is certainly an incentive for them to 
make every effort possible to do this. 

EMPLOYMENT 

The forests provide, directly and indirectly, employment for a 
large percentage of the people in Mississippi who are employed, es- 
pecially in the industrial groups. According to the 1945 report of the 
State Forest Service in cooperation with the U. S. Forest Service, 
55,000 people are employed in the woods and plants manufacturing 
forest products. The report further shows that 11 people are em- 
ployed in the woods and forest industry for each 5 people employed 
by transportation, 5 in construction, and 15 in all other manufactur- 
ing. In other words, for each 11 people employed in woods and forest 
industry there are 25 employed in transportation, construction, and 
all other manufacturing. 

According to the Southern Forest Experiment Station, approxi- 
mately 61 acres of forest land will provide full-time employment for 
one person. This includes forest management, fire protection, cut- 
ting, loading, and hauling, as well as milling of all products. On this 
basis, Mississippi's 16,500,000 acres of forest land would provide 
full-time employment for over 254,000 men. Mississippi has, ac- 
cording to 1940 U. S. Census, 291,092 farm operators (all nationali- 
ties). Assuming that these operators could spare only one-fourth 
of their time for forest work, this number would be equivalent to 
72,773 full-time workers in the forests. Thus, it can be seen that 
a very large number of additional workers could be employed in 
Mississippi in the forests alone. In order to put all of the Mississippi 
forests under proper management and supervision, it would require 
a detailed and thorough educational program which would necessitate 
the employment of a large number of technical workers in the edu- 
cational field, such as farm forester's supervisors, educational in- 
structors in public schools, etc. 

The forest is certainly one of Mississippi's most important na- 



10 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



tural resources. Up to the present time the subject of forestry has 
been sadly neglected in our educational program in Mississippi. It 
is imperative that steps be taken to conserve this resource to the 

maximum and at the same time increase the annual income from 
forests through better forestry practices.

PART III 

SOME PRINCIPLES OF FARM WOODLAND MANAGEMENT 

A few years ago farm woodlands were considered as so much 
poor pasture or waste land. More recently they have been used as 
a source of income for the payment of taxes on the farm, and many 
farmers are using them as a reliable "cash crop" in addition. Except 
in unusual cases farm woodlands will, undoubtedly, never provide the 
major source of farm income in the Delta and Prairie Counties, but 
in other parts of the State some are already providing the major 
source of farm income and with proper timber management this may 
be brought about in many of the counties of the State. The proper 
increase in the yearly production income may provide a very real 
source of off-season employment as well. 

With so many farmers really interested in the proper handling 
of their woodlands, it will be desirable to review the more important 
principles of good timber management and to assist farmers whenever 
possible to set up a desirable plan of management. Although the 
woodland has great financial possibilities, farmers should at the same 
time realize that it is impossible to change a badly mismanaged and 
practically worthless timber stand into a highly productive one over- 
night, just as it is impossible to change a worn out and badly eroded 
field into a highly productive one in a few months. The principal 
topics discussed below on this subject of farm woodland management 
are: (1) Improvement cuttings, which includes (a) liberation cut- 
tings, (b) thinning, and (c) pruning; (2) harvest cutting, which 
includes discussions on (a) selective cutting (individual tree and 
group selection), (b) seed tree method and (c) clear cutting method 
with natural and artificial reproduction. 

IMPROVEMENT CUTTINGS 

An ''improvement cutting," as the name implies, is the cutting of 
timber in a forest or woodland for the purpose of improving the con- 
dition and composition of the stand. When it involves the freeing 
of young, desirable growth from competition with "wolf" trees or 
cull trees, it is called a liberation cutting, and when it is made in 
immature stands for the purpose of increasing the growth of the 
trees that are left, it is called thinning. 

LIBERATION CUTTINGS 

Practically all woodlands contain from a few to a large number 
of low quality or practically worthless trees, usually called "wolf" 
trees or cull trees, as a result of past cutting practices whereby each 
time a stand is cut over, the better trees are usually removed and no ef- 
fort is made to get rid of the ones that have little value. Before any 
serious attempt is made to manage such a stand, these low quality and 
worthless trees should be removed if they have any value, or girdled if 
valueless. Very crooked, very limby, rotten, and other cull trees may 
reduce the effective growing area of a woodland by one-half or more, 
and attempting to grow a crop of timber on such areas is very similar 
to an attempt to grow a good crop of corn in an uncultivated field : the 
yield in both cases will be inversely proportional to the number of

sales. Tops left after loggings were used for pulpwood and fuel wood.

weeds present. Girdling of these trees by cutting the through bark and 
cambium layer (if unmerchantable), of course, costs money or effort. 
However, studies made by the Southern Forest Experiment Station 
have indicated that increased growth on the reserved trees as a result 
of girdling the w^orthless trees, will usually more than pay for the 
operation within a 5-year period. Even in mature stands that are to 
be cut selectively, the first cutting which takes out the low quality 
and worthless trees may be considered an improvement cutting, even 
though 40 percent of the total volume of the stand is removed. 

As pointed out in Part VII of this bulletin in the Fuel Wood 
Section, this type timber may be used for fuel wood and the cuttings 
made as the need arises for such products. More time may be re- 
quired to make improvement cuttings in this way, but certainly it 
would be a dual purpose cutting in that at the same time improvement 
cuttings are made, farm needs are being fulfilled and a waste of 
timber is also prevented. 

The maximum possible growth and profit from the management 
of timberlands are not possible except through improvement cuttings 
of the proper intensity made at the proper times in the life of the 
stand. 

In some cases a part of such cuttings may be used for crossties, 
or sawlogs if the timber is of sufficient quality. If the owner is not 
equipped to make his own improvement cuttings, he can mark the 
trees to be cut and sell by contract to the highest bidder even though 
the trees might be small. 

THINNING 

In order to grow tall, straight trees, it is necessary that they be 
grown close together. Otherwise, they will develop heavy side limbs 
and short boles or trunks. Competition for light forces height 
growth, and prevents the over-development of side limbs. As height 
increases, the lower limbs die, and fall off or break off from the effect 
of the wind or other mechanical forces. This results in earlier grow- 
ing of knot-free lumber. 

Crowding, in time, works to the harm of the trees in that root 
competition for water and minerals and crown competition for 
light, as the tree increases in size, reduces the percentage of tree in 
live crown, thereby lowering the food manufacturing part of the tree. 
This causes the tree to slow down in growth in proportion to crown 
reduction, the crown being the upper part of a tree including the 
branches with their foliage. The trees thus reach a point where na- 
tural mortality off -sets the increase in volume per acre. This point 
is known as stand stagnation and is the time for a thinning, which 
by reducing competition and affording more growing space, will 
increase the growth of the remaining trees. This, in part, is brought 
about by increased development of the crowns of crop trees. No 
other thinning will be needed until the crowns of crop trees once more 
become crowded and begin to interlace with each other. 



16 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 




FIGURE 3 — A stand of young longleaf pine in need of thinning. 



If nalux e is permitted to take its own course, competition will be so 
keen that a percentage of the trees will die annually. This is an econom- 
ic waste because by thinning at the right time, all the trees that will 
eventually drop out and be wasted can be utilized for fuelwood, pulp- 
wood, small sawlogs, and small poles. The net result being that the 
final crop will be 60 to 120 trees, 16 to 24 inches in diameter, in both 
cases. The difference is that by proper thinning the trees can be 
grown to that size in anywhere from 10 to 30 years sooner than by 
natural thinning, and a cash return from each thinning made for the 
owner instead of being wasted otherwise. 

A study in thinning is underway at the Crossett Experiment Sta- 
tion, Crossf'tt. Arkansas, with a stand of loblolly pines. At the be- 
ginning of the test the trees were 40 years of age and there was an 
average of 40C trees per acre. The trees had been stagnated for 
nearly 20 years, showing very little net increase (0.01 cord per acre 
year, 1939). The small growth o i the living trees was practically 
wiped out, on an acre basis, by th' annual loss in trees dying out from 
overcrowding. To try to find out how many trees should be re- 
moved, five 1-acre plots were cut over, each one heavier than the 
former. One acre of trees (400 per acre) were left unthinned as a 
check plot. The results of this thinning one year afterwards is 
shown below :

Glancing at the above results it might appear that removing 200 
trees per acre and leaving 200 crop trees per acre v^as by far the 
best method. This is true for the first year and maybe for the first 
2 years; however, several factors enter the picture at this point. 
After 2 or 3 years the stands with 100, 70, and 40 cash trees per acre 
left, showed a rapid increase in their net growth per acre over that 
of 0.45, 0.38, and 0.31 cords per acre per year, as shown above for the 
first year, while the net increase per acre of the plot with 200 trees 
increased very little above its first year net of 0.97 cords per acre. 
By the end of the third year after thinning, the first plot with 200 
trees per acre was ready for another thinning because the crowns 
had grown together again, forming a closed canopy. The stands of 
100 trees per acre probably will not have to be thinned for 5 years 
after the original thinning, while the 70 and 40 trees per acre will 
probably need no more thinning, reaching financial maturity without 
becoming too crowded again. 

Studying these results it would appear that if a farmer had a 
similar stand of trees he would have to decide several things before 
cutting any trees: First, would he like to have an income from his 
timber at short intervals of say 2 to 4 years and get the maximum 
production from his land? Second, does he have to have more money 
at the time of harvest than a light thinning would provide? Third, 
can he wait 5 to 10 or 15 years until the next timber harvest? If his 
decision is the first, then he would leave (in a stand of the same con- 
ditions as described above) between 150 to 200 trees per acre. If his 
decision is either of the last two, then he can remove more trees, leav- 
ing 40 to 100 trees per acre, depending on how long he wants to wait 
for the next harvest. It is taken for granted here that 200 trees per 
acre was the maximum number and 40 the minimum number to be left. 

Farm woodland owners should, therefore, plan to start thinning 
dense stands as soon as the trees become merchantable (at fuel wood 
or pulpwood size) and should make repeated light thinnings in order 
to prevent slowing up of the growth rate. At the same time as many 
trees as will grow satisfactorily should be carried on each acre. 

Spacing of trees left. One rule of thumb for spacing of trees 
is to add four to the number of inches which the diameter of the tree 
measures at breast height and use this number in feet for the spacing 
of trees. Example : For a 5-inch tree add 4 to 5 which equals 9 ; thus 
5-inch trees should be spaced about 9 feet apart. Likewise, 7-inch 



18 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



trees should be 11 feet apart, and so on. This will usually give a 
crown space of an opening between any two trees as wide as the crown 
itself. The crop trees left will then grow at a more or less constant 
rate until the crowns of adjoining trees begin to interlock. The stand 
then is ready for the next harvest cutting. On pines this may mean a 
harvest cutting every 4 to 8 years. 

Careful pulpwood thinning may be made at any time of the year 
although winter cutting is the safest to protect remaining trees from 
insect damage.

than, the number to be left, mark those to be left. Dry paint or chalk

trees to be cut are relatively few, mark them rather than those to 
remain. Be sure an owner does not mark one stand one way and 
another just the opposite. Experienced cutters, once they are thor- 
oughly accustomed to thinning, can thin without preliminary mark- 
ing. Special attention should be given to selection of trees to be left. 
Trees to be cut then are merely those not desirable to leave. They 
can be thought of as trees to be cut not for the sake of cutting, but 
rather because they are interferring with the development of the se- 
lected trees or because they are not needed in the stand. 

Make frequent checks of the number of trees being left, in order 
to keep the thinning along the lines of the method decided upon. Ex- 
perience and judgment, however, should have full play and the mark- 
ing should be governed by these factors rather than by average fig- 
ures as given here. Local conditions require local treatment. 

Mark and thin by relatively small units, such as quarter-acres or 
small groups of trees, in order to keep the spacing as regular as pos- 
sible. Thus 200 trees per acre should be thought of as, say, 50 trees 
per quarter-acre or as trees spaced about 15 feet apart. Spacing 
should be sacrificed, however, to secure good, sound, straight, and 
vigorous trees. 

PRUNING 

Another good forestry practice is the pruning of the lower limbs 
of trees which are to be reserved for future saw timber. If trees are 
grown in fully stocked stands, natural pruning will usually result, but 
in open stands, the side limbs persist indefinitely. Thus, pruning 
open stands improves the quality of timber and increases the value 
considerably. This is true because if a tree is pruned when it is very 
small the knot formed because of the limb, is likewise small and con- 
fined to the center of the tree. But if the tree is quite large before 
it is pruned, either artificially or naturally, large knots are formed 
which in turn lowers the grade of timber. Pruning open-grown 
timber also increases the body length of trees. Again the earlier this 
is done in the life of the tree, the higher the quality of crop trees 
and the resulting products. 

It is not a good practice to use an axe in pruning as serious in- 
jury may result from wounds made in the living parts of the tree. A 
saw should be used instead. 

Doubtless the best time for forest pruning of pines in Mississippi 
is during the fall and winter. Incidentally, the limbs taken in prun- 
ing could be used to very good advantage as brush for checking erosion 
in gullies or as mulch on eroding land surfaces. 

Trees under 20 feet in height, prune up to 50 percent of total 
height. Trees 20 feet in height and over may safely be pruned up to 
two-thirds of total height of the tree. Pruning should be carried on 
with a view of producing at least one and sometimes two 16-foot logs. 

The selection of the trees to be pruned is of the highest import- 
ance, requiring good judgment and careful consideration. The one 
who selects the trees to be pruned must size up both the merits and 
defects of the trees, their vigor of growth and promise, their distri- 
bution or distance from other trees of the same class ; in other words.

he must select his crop trees and visualize the stand as it is expected 
to appear 5, 10, 15 or more years later, depending upon its present 
age, rate of growth, and the kinds of products to be grown. 

Prune only the crop trees, that is, those that will produce poles, 
piling (although here large knots are not so much of a defect as in 
poles), veneer logs, and clear sawlogs. It is rarely practicable to 
prune trees that promise the production only of crossties, pulpwood, 
fuel wood, or other rough-timber products. There will usually be 
from 50 to 200 trees per acre ranging in diameter from. 3 inches to 
8 inches that are considered crop trees and only those trees should 
be pruned. 

Experimental work has shown that the labor cost of pruning 
open-grown limby pines amounted to approximately 2 cents each for 
4-inch trees, 3 cents for 6-inch trees and 4 cents for 8-inch trees. 
These costs were more than off-set by the increased quality and value 
of the products sold from the same trees when mature.

HARVEST CUTTING METHODS 

There are many cutting methods described by various authorities. 
Only a few of these are discussed below but it is thought that under 
Mississippi conditions it is not necessary to discuss all the methods. 
Those described below are (1) selective cuttings by (a) individual 
tree selection, and (b) group selection-; (2) seed tree; and (3) clear 
cutting. In connection with clear cutting, natural reproduction and 
artificial planting are discussed. 

Since these methods are discussed separately one might get the idea 
that a farmer could select any one of them and follow it in making his 
harvest cuttings. However, that is not the procedure intended or 
suggested. On the other hand, a farmer should take the situation 
he has and apply these cutting methods according to the conditions 
that exist on his farm, using the method or methods needed. He may 
have even-aged or uneven-aged timber stands or possibly both on the 
same farm. If he has both conditions, he will need to employ a com- 
bination of cutting methods. Also, a farmer may have even-aged 
stands altogether and want to convert them to uneven-aged stands 
in order to have harvest cuttings and cash returns more often and at 
the same time possibly get a faster average growth. Too, in any 
harvest cutting of mature timber, plenty of seed trees should be left. 

Some parts of the farm woodland may need improvement cut- 
tings which might be made along with the harvest cutting. Therefore, 
it is not likely that there are many cases where a farmer would use 
the principles involved in only one cutting method. But he should 
use the combination that will give the best growth, returns, and na- 
tural reproduction with the particular conditions at hand. 



22 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



SELECTIVE CUTTING METHOD 

Individual tree selecfAon. As the name implies, individual tree 
selection is that of selecting individual trees for harvest throughout 
the woodland or forest that are mature or that are retarding the 
growth of better trees that would otherwise make faster growth and 
better quality sawlogs than those selected for harvest. 

The practice of selective harvesting is now widely employed in 
the large commercial forests, but is equally suitable and valuable 
on smaller farm woodlands. 

The objective of selective harvesting, as with other good forestry 
practices, is to assist nature in growing a continuous crop of trees so 
that after each subsequent harvest of trees, the remaining forest or 
woodland will be self -replenishing. 

Selective harvesting, although it includes the principles of im- 
provement cutting, refers in general to the cutting of mature timber. 
As pointed out previously, the cutting of defective mature timber is 
sometimes referred to as an improvement cutting. Ordinarily, se- 
lective harvesting does not take place until the timber stand is brought 
into good growing conditions as a result of the necessary improvement 
cuttings which have been made at periodic intervals in the develop- 
ment of the timber stand. Several thinnings may have to be made

over a period of 10 or 15 years before the selective cutting operations 
begin. 

A well-stocked, 40-acre tract of the Crossett Experimental 
Forest, Crossett, Arkansas, is being managed as a farm woodland, 
from which the growth is removed each year. Only low quality ma- 
terial was removed in earlier cuttings. In 1940, the stumpage value 
of all products was $2.97 per acre. The average for the 8-year period 
1938-45 was $3.99, while the value in 1945 was $4.91 per acre per 
year. Thus, income from the tract has steadily increased. When the 
wood was cut and delivered, the returns per acre per year averaged 
$14.55 for the 8-year period. For 1945 this was $15.09 per acre. 

Figures on this 40-acre tract are shown below as to volume of 
the various products cut, as well as the stumpage value and value 
delivered to the market for the past 8 years, and for 1945. Also a 
description of the timber stand is shown before cutting in 1945.

FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI

A special study on 32 farms in Northeast Mississippi last year 
by Dr. W. J. Edens, State College, Mississippi, shows that labor re- 
turns per hour on cotton in 1944 was approximately $0.63. The 
yield per acre was 0.98 of a bale. The labor returns per acre were 
$88.92 which is much higher than shown above for timber; however, 
the wage per hour is higher from timber. 

The stand on this 40-acre tract is in better condition than in the 
beginning and more than one-third of the original volume has been 
cut and the forest volume is more than the original volume when cut- 
ting began in 1938. Another advantage of selective harvesting is 
that there is no long waiting period for returns. The above tables 
show that a crop of timber can be harvested annually or the farm 
tract can be divided into smaller tracts, cutting one of them each year 
80 that all tracts will be cut over every 3 to 5 years which also gives 
an annual harvest. 

There are markets for sawlogs or lumber throughout Mississippi. 
Hence, the timber grower can plan on producing sawlogs with reason- 
able assurance of finding a favorable market for his product. Since 
the tree crop is not perishable, he can postpone his cutting operation 
for one or more years, if the market is unfavorable. In other words, 
he can 'Vait out the depression" without financial loss or without 
sacrificing his timber, and the trees continue to increase in volume and 
value while standing there. 

Mature trees, or those that have reached the approximate end 
of their fast growing years, should be marked for cutting, unless they 
are needed for seed trees. (Always take into account that nature 
can replant from seed trees much more effectively or efficiently and 
very much cheaper than can man by artificial means.) But even 
some smaller trees may be marked for cutting if their removal will 
speed the growth of better quality trees nearby. 

While going about the job of selective harvesting, two purposes 
are accomplished — increased revenue and an improved woodland. 

Ordinarily the selective harvesting of timber should occur at in- 
tervals of from 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 years, depending upon the individual 
farmer's needs and the need of the individual tracts of timber. A 
i general type farmer with sources of income other than timber, may 
need to make heavier cuttings or harvests at less frequent intervals, 
or when he has years of short income from these other sources of in- 
come (excluding timber), rather than follow a. regular cutting cycle. 
However, the harvest should never exceed the growth since the last 
cut. In other words, if a 40-acre tract of farm w^oodlands averaged 
3500 board feet per acre after it has been cut over, and in 5 years has 
increased to 5,000 board feet and it is decided to make another har- 
vest, do not remove over 1,500 board feet per acre. It would be even 
better if only 500 board feet per acre were cut, the growing stock 
would then be built up to 4,500 board feet instead of the 3,500 board 
feet. After the first harvest cutting, the annual growth might in- 
crease to 320 board feet per acre over the next 5 years. This v/ould 
mean a per year increase of from 4,500 to 6,100 board feet per acre 



26 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



or a net growth of 1,600 board feet. Now if he decided that 5,000 
board feet per acre is near a fully stocked stand for his land then he 
can harvest 1,100 board feet per acre. A fully stocked forest of all 
sawlog size trees should average, in Mississippi, from 5,000 to 8,000 
board feet per acre. Just as with cotton or corn, you have to have 
a fully stocked stand of trees to get the highest production returns 
per acre. For example, a stand with only 2,000 board feet per acre 
may increase at the rate of 150 to 200 board feet per acre, whereas 
a stand of 6,000 board feet per acre may produce 250 to 300 board 
feet per acre. 

At the Crossett Experimental Forest, Crossett, Arkansas, a cut- 
ting plan has been worked out whereby a volume equivalent to the 
total growth is removed if the stand is fully stocked or contains 1,469 
cubic feet or approximately 10,000 board feet per acre. If on a par- 
ticular woodland, however, the stand contained only 292 cubic feet 
per acre, or approximately 2,000 board feet, he should remove only 
half of the growth. And if the stock is somewhere between 2,000 and 
10,000 feet, he should remove a proportionate percentage (between 
50 an,d 100 percent of the growth). On this basis the following table 
which indicates the percentage of the growing stock to be cut if the 
area is to be cut over every year or every 3, 6, or 9 years has been 
computed :

From the above it can t.e seen that if the stand is fully stocked 
and the area is to be cut over every year, 6.0 percent of the total 
volume can be cut each year and this should be restored by growth 
during the following year. If the sam-^ lully-stocked stand is to be 
cut over every 3 years, 16 percent of the total volume can be removed 
and the growth during the following 3 years should build the stand 
back up to the original volume If the stand contains only 2,000 board 
feet (292 cubic feet) per acre, 3 percent of the total volume would be 
cut if the area was cut over every year or 8 percent :>f the total volume 
would be cut if the stand was to be cut over every 3 years. 

There always has been some woodland owners, who because of 
the need for ready cash or because of the appeal of a lump-sum pay- 
ment have cut or allowed all of their timber, with perhaps the ex- 
ception of a few seed trees, to be cut. In some cases, where it is 
absolutely necessary to have the money to save the farm, such practice 
is necessary, but should be avoided wherever possible. 

In such cases, however, the owner of the woodland disposes of the 
possibility of a good steady income in the future for a comparatively 
small amount of money in a lump-sum payment. 

Practically all shortleaf -loblolly pine-hardwood stands, even old- 
field stands that are of one age, contain trees of many different sizes. 
Any clear cutting, therefore, removes not only the financially mature 
trees but also a large number that are not financially mature and that 
are just at the point of beginning to earn the owner a good return 
on the investment. Data from recent studies on the value of growth 
of various sizes when the material is sold for pulpwood may help to 
bring out this point. Data of interest from this study are as fol- 
lows:

These data show that 4-inch pine trees increase 114 percent in 
volume and value for 1-inch increases in diameter by the time they 
become 5-inch trees. Likewise 5-inch trees increase 80 percent in 
value for 1-inch increases in diameter, 6-inch trees increase 70 per- 
cent, 8-inch trees increase 36 percent, and 10-inch trees increase 28 
percent. Since it takes, on the average, about 3 years for a well 
spaced pine tree to increase 1 inch in diameter, 4-inch trees of this 
class are increasing about 38 percent per year, 6-inch trees about 23 
percent per year, 8-inch trees about 12 percent per year, and 10-inch 
trees about 9 percent per year. Even in normal times when other 
good investments will yield 4 or 5 percent per year the increase in 
value of small timber as a result of growth is more than worthy of 
consideration. 

Farmers who sell all trees 4 to 12 inches in diameter for either 
pulpwood or sawlogs are losing money at a rapid rate. It is equiva- 
lent to selling off all the hens in a flock of chickens that are laying 
from 200 to 300 eggs per year. 

A study in which logs were the end product of the management 
gave similar results. Twelve-inch trees increased in volume and 
value at the rate of about 30 percent per year, 13-inch trees increased 
at the rate of about 25 percent per year, 15-inch trees at the rate of 
about 21 percent per year, and 17-inch trees at the rate of about 14 
percent per year. This, too, is a pretty good return on the invest- 
ment; however, the same results could not be expected when a normal 
growth, or 1-inch in diameter every three years, was not secured. 

The owner should possess a knowledge of forestry before at- 
tempting to select trees for harvest and should also be able to estimate 
the volume of lumber or other wood products in the trees that he 
plans to cut. 

Pines in Mississippi reach financial maturity when they reach the 
sizes of 16 to 26 inches in diameter depending upon soil site and many 
other factors. In determining when a good straight sawlog tree is 
mature and ready to cut, other factors to be considered in addition 
to its rate of growth and earning power described above, are physical 
factors. These are: on pines, trees become flat-topped; signs of 
redheart may be seen ; a fungus growth may appear in the form of 
a shelf -like outgrowth high on the trunk of the tree or a wound or a 
knot from which resin is running down the trunk ; bark may become 
thin and reddish in color, and dying of branches may be seen in top of 
trees ; on hardwoods, branches dying in top of tree is the most common 
symptom. 

Group selection method. In defining the selection method it was 
stated that the trees cut at any one time might be standing singly or 
in small groups. There are certain advantages in maintaining a 
group-wise arrangement of trees of the same age. Less breakage 
among younger trees is caused in felling and removing the oldest age 
class. The cost of logging may be slightly reduced. More light is 
provided for the development of seedlings and young trees. This is 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



29 



of especial importance in the case of the so-called light-demanding 
species. Such species should not be managed under a method of 
single tree selection. An advantage is that the grouping enables the 
individual trees within each group to grow under conditions prevail- 
ing in even-aged stands, thus obtaining greater freedom from 
branches and more cylindrical stems than might be secured in single 
tree selection stands. 

By varying the size of the group, great flexibility in application 
is possible. The oldest groups may contain only two to five trees and 
from this range up to more than a hundred, occupying ordinarily 1 to 
4 acres. It is possible that even larger groups can be employed. 
Where the groups occupy more than a quarter of an acre, the stand 
tends to lose its uneven-aged form. With larger groups, one of the 
distinctive characteristics of the selection method is minimized or 
reduced, namely, the protection afforded the soil and reproduction. 
The groups should be small enough, so that seed can be distributed in 
abundance over the cleared area, and so that surrounding trees may- 
conserve soil moisture and shelter or protect reproduction. 

Where groups too large for adequate distribution of seed from the 
side are cut, it becomes necessary either to reproduce the center of the 
cleared patch artificially or, as is more customary, to leave a few 
seed trees scattered over the area. 

Unless an area basis is used to control the extent of the territory 
cut over at one time it becomes very easy to over-cut in applying the 
group selection method. 

SEED TREE METHOD 

With this method the area is cut clear except for certain trees 
(called seed trees) left standing singly or in groups for the purpose of 
furnishing seed to restock naturally the cleared area. Only a small 
percentage of the total volume, ordinarily less than 10 percent, is left 
standing as seed trees. 

Usually from 4 to 10 seed trees should be left per acre, the num- 
ber depending on the number of seed produced per tree, weight of the 
seed, and the conditions under which the seed must germinate. 

When enough seedlings to make a full stand become established, 
the purpose for which the seed trees were left is accomplished. It 
may pay to remove them at this point if the reproduction is large 
enough to be beyond danger of destruction by most fires, which may 
be from 8 to 12 years of age. This would leave the new stand to 
develop unhampered, to be utilized according to their quality, size 
and height, for merchantable purposes or for use on the farm. 

In some classifications the seed tree method has been included 
under clear-cutting methods. The leaving of seed trees, together with 
the fact that the seed supply is furnished by these seed trees standing 
on the area cut instead of by trees cut in the clearing operation or by 
trees standing outside the area cleared, warrants the separation into 
two methods. 



30 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



As a result of the seed tree method an even-aged stand is pro- 
duced. There may be a range of 5 to 10 years in age between the 
young seedlings which start on the cut-over area, but not enough dif- 
ference to prevent the stand from being even-aged. 

It is important that good seed trees be selected. Trees well root- 
ed are not as apt to blow down. They should be old enough to produce 
abundant fertile seed and tall enough to scatter the seed thoroughly 
over the area. In selecting pine seed trees to leave, choose good 
straight trees 10 to 16 inches d.b.h. that have at least one-third of 
total height in live crown. A tree that will produce at least two 
16-foot logs when it is later harvested will earn the best dividends n 
timber growth. 




CLEAR CUTTING METHOD 

In this method the area is cut clear. Reproduction is secured 
after the cutting, either artificially by seeding or planting, or natural- 
ly by seed distributed from trees standing outside the area cleared, or 
from trees cut in the clearing operations. This method resolves 
however into either (1) clear cutting with artificial reproduction or 
(2) clear cutting with natural reproduction.

CLEAR CUTTING WITH NATURAL REPRODUCTION 

Here ^h ^ stand is cut clear and reproduction springs up naturally 
on the clear -rea. This reproduction, to secure best results, should 
start immediately but frequently requires several years. The seed 
from which the new stand originates comes from two sources: 

(a) Trees standing outside (usually adjacent to) the area cleared. 
The seed are disseminated (by wind) over the cleared area most 
thickly, close to the parent trees on the borders of the clearing, and in 
decreasing amount toward the center. Reproduction arising from 
such seeding is likely to be too dense around the edges and too sparse 
or lacking altogether in the middle. For best results the cleared area 
should )iot be wider than a distance equal to one or two times the 
height of the adjacent timber. 




FIGURE 8 — Group clear cutting. Never clear cut unless there are enough seed trees adjoining 

the clear cut strip or group to reseed the area clear cut. The clear cut area should not be wider than 
a distance equal to one or two times the height of the adjacent seed trees. 



32 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



(b) Ripe seed on the trees at time of cutting. A uniform and com- 
plete reproduction frequently will follow where this source of seed is 
available on the cleared area. 

Successful natural reproduction following a clear-cutting depends 
first on an abundant seed supply over the entire area and second upon 
the existence of conditions favorable to the germination of the seed 
and development of the young seedling. The method involves a 
sudden and complete exposure of the ground. In order to secure a 
new crop, the species being reproduced must be capable of establishing 
itself under these difficult conditions. 

Where clear cutting is practiced it may be necessary that one of 
the following treatments be given the area in order to make con- 
ditions favorable for germination of seed and survival of seedlings: 

1. Treatment of^ live vegetation likely to compete. Frequently 
trees of inferior species and low quality are left on a cut-over area. 
This appears most frequently on clear cut areas. If this is true, such 
trees with more space will likely develop spreading crowns and hamper 
and prevent growth of the seedlings and it may be necessary to re- 
move them. However, they might be poisoned or girdled. In some 
cases, some vegetation such as grasses, shrubs, and other plans offer 
interference with reproduction. 

2. Treatment of the soil. Where the soil has been exposed 
previous to cutting the timber, soil conditions may need to be im- 
proved. This may exist where forests are repeatedly burned-over and 
there is no vegetation or organic material on the ground. Therefore, 
falling seed lie exposed on the soil which is clean or barren and which 
may be very hard. In such cases, cultivation with a harrow or 
similar tool may be helpful.

CLEAR CUTTING WITH ARTIFICIAL REPRODUCTION 

Where is is possible, natural reproduction is better than arti- 
ficial. Certainly it is cheaper and more practical. However, plant- 
ing is necessary in some cases to maintain or improve existing stands 
of timber, also where new stands are established on land retired from 
cultivation or to control erosion.' 

One important difference between natural reproduction and 
planting should be emphasized at the start. If, because of a poor 
seed crop or of drought, natural reproduction fails in any one year 
despite correct selective cutting of an existing stand, no great harm 
is done. The seed-producing trees are still there, increasing in size 
and value, and should still produce seed enough for reproduction 
another year. In contrast, planting represents an outlay of cash 
and labor, and if an error in any one of the numerous steps in the 
planting process causes the plantation to fail, there is no growth go- 
ing on and no free ''second chance" ; the only way to get a plantation 
is by a second expenditure of labor and cash. For this reason 
practices and results should be checked carefully before planting is 
planned, recommended, or supervised. 

One strong similarity between natural reproduction and planting, 
too often ignored or overlooked, should also be emphasized at the start. 
The object of planting and the result of successful planting, is not, 
as is sometimes assumed, the establishment of some queer, freakish, 
extra-special kind of forest stand that follows laws different from 
those of natural stands. On the contrary, the object of planting is 



34 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



to establish a fully stocked, rapidly growing, increasingly valuable 
forest stand, capable of producing a variety of products over a long 
term of years. 

A thorough understanding of these two-points, the importance of 
proceeding soundly step by step through the entire planting process, 
and the fact that the object is to produce a good and readily managed 
stand, furnishes a sound basis for planning, recommending, and es- 
tablishing plantations, and should help greatly in acquiring the de- 
tailed, locally adaptable information needed to make planting a 
success. 

Factors affecting initial survival. These are of concern largely 
during the actual planting. The principal ones are: 



(Planter's responsi- 
bility and under his 
control). 



(Of major import- 
ance when planta- 
tions are planned or 
advised). 



1. Choice of species for site; of site for species 

2. Preparation of site (especially in erosion control). 

3. Storage; perhaps heeling-in of stock. 

4. The planting itself. 

5. Protection from fire; from grazing. 

6. Weather. (Planter can merely study this, and 
allow for the peculiarities of his locality.) 

Factors affecting thrift, development and value. 

1. Choice of species for site; of site lor species. 

2. Spacing. 

3. Continued protection against fire, grazing, 
and possibly insects and disease. 

4. Cleanings and liberation cuttings. 

5. Pruning. 

6. Thinnings and improvement cuttings. 

Planting Stock. One-year-old nursery-grown seedlings are pre- 
ferred for planting. The Mississippi State Department of Forestry 
maintains a forest nursery from which stock may be obtained free for 
planting on farms within the State; orders should be placed in late 
summer or early fall with the area ranger or county agent. 

Seedlings that have come up on old fields or along roads near 
the planting site have been used with good success, especially if grown 
in full sunlight and transplanted with earth still around their roots. 
On the whole, however, such wild stock is likely to cost more and to 
give less satisfactory results. 

Digging Seedlings. Where wild seedlings are used by farmers, 
the seedlings should be dug carefully, the soil falling from the roots 
gradually so as to cause the least possible injury to the rootlets. The 
roots should be kept moist at all times and never be allowed to become 
the least bit dry. If the taproots are long, they should be pruned 
back to about eight inches in length, using a large sharp knife and 
a board. If planting is to be done nearby or soon, the bundles of 
trees are kept moist in wet moss or wet burlap. If not, they should 
be ''heeled" in fresh soil. To do this, a trench is dug in a shaded or 
cool location with one sloping side, preferably sloping toward the 
north. The bundles of trees are laid close together and the roots and 
stems, but not the leaves or tops, are then covered with one thickness 
of burlap, some brush or soil and if they become dry they should be 
well watered. In this manner seedlings may be safely kept for 
weeks. The sooner the seedlings are planted on the site where they 
are to grow, the better the chance of their survival. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 35 




Dig V-shaped trench in moist shady place. Break bundles 
and spread seedlings out evenly in trench, being careful not 
to curl or jam roots at bottom of trench. 




Fill in loose soil and water well. Complete filling trench with 
soil, until roots are well covered to the same depth they grew 
in the nursery, but no deeper. Water **heel-in" bed daily. 

FIGURE 10 — Heeling-in seedlings. 

Sites and species. Much can be learned about choice of land to 
plant and choice of species by studying the various species on similar 
soils nearby. Some species of pine can be planted successfully on 
almost any land formerly in pine and on many farmed-out soils 
originally in upland hardwoods. It is most worthwhile on good land 
restocking too slowly (as from lack of seed trees nearby) or requiring 
a thick cover to control erosion. 

When there is doubt about which species to plant, or enough of 
one species to cover the entire area is not obtainable, it is well to mix 
two species — preferably an acre of one and an acre of another. Such 
a mixture may prevent total loss from some insect or disease attacking 
a single species and is thought to produce healthier, better-formed 
trees. Use the specie of trees native to the land on which they are to 
be planted. 

Plantation spacing. From studies made of earlier plantations of 
pine at Bogolusa, Louisiana, by the Southern Forest Experiment Sta- 
tion it was found that : 



36 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



1. Close spacing reduces rate of diameter growth. 

2. Close spacing increases rate of self-pruning. 

3. A closely spaced plantation is easier to mark for thinning 
than a widely spaced plantation, permits more complete re- 
moval of crooked, forked, and infected trees at the first cut, 
and leaves more trees, better spaced, for later cuts. Close 
spacing with skillful thinning results in very nearly the 
ideal of stand management. 

4. Wide spacing produces a better turpentine size tree at an 
earlier age. 

5. Wide spacing produces trees of turpentining size at an earlier 
age. 

6. Wide spacing produces trees of pulpwood size at an earlier 
age. 

7. When pulpwood can be cut, however, especially in small sizes 
or where thinnings can be used for fuelwood, wide spacing 
does not make as full use of the ground by any means as close 
spacing, for, say, the first 15 years. 

8. Where pulpwood or other small products cannot be cut (as 
on some extensive industrial holdings), the lack of early 
thinnings might cause a plantation as close as 5 x 5 feet to 
suffer serious reduction in growth, become stagnant, and 
cause waste through the death of suppressed trees. 

Slow diameter growth (Point 1 above) counts against close spac- 
ing only in that it slightly delays the first cut. It is actually ad- 
vantageous in that it helps keep the number of rings per radial inch 
within specifications for structural timber and piling, and, with point 
2, in that it confines knots to a small central area. 

Rapid self -pruning (point 2 above) seems to apply particularly 
in the case of loblolly pine, which is often excessively branchy because 
of attack by tip moth; and of longleaf pine, which starts height 
growth irregularly, so that at wide spacing the fastest growing trees 
become limby through insufficient crowding by their neighbors. 

The advantage for wide spacing in point 6 (early pulpwood pro- 
duction) is distinctly offset by the disadvantage of incomplete utiliza- 
tion of the land. The 8x8 spacing produces a cut sooner than the 
5 X 5 if only the trees 6 or 7 inches and up are acceptable for pulp- 
wood, but at the same age produces far less than the 5 x 5 if the trees 
down to 4 inches d.b.h. can be used. 

Recommendations for a spacing of SVo x 51/2^ or 5 x 5 feet 
are strengthened by accessibility to a pulpmill. Where expenditures 
are being made for fences and firebreaks, recommendations for close 
spacing are further strengthened by the fact that the costs of fencing, 
and making firebreaks are pro-rated over more trees. In other 
words, why have $100.00 worth of fence protect only three-fourths 
or one-half the merchantable material it can be made to cover? 

Even after due weight has been given to the points already dis- 
cussed, the most important factor in choosing the correct spacing 
may be entirely overlooked. This factor is the survival it is reason- 
able to expect. Many planters and planting advisors are so obsessed 
with the cost per thousand trees and the labor of planting them that 
they forget that the stand they are going to mark and thin will consist 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



37 



only of the trees, perhaps relatively few, that will reach an age of 1 5 
years, or thereabouts, and not of the many trees they buy and plant. 

Table 8 shows the number of trees per acre that will be available 
at the first cut, at various spacings and survival percentages- -as- 
suming survival to be measured at 15 years. By reducing these fig- 
ures 30 percent to 50 per cent an approximate picture of the stand 
left for further growth and a second cut m: y be obtained. These 
figures are a strong argument for close spacing where local experience 
shows that survival is likely to be low.

Planting. The essentials of good planting are (1) to keep the 
roots wet; (2) set the tree with its roots spread out in a natural po- 
sition; (3) firm or pack the soil in the hole; (4) set the tree a little 
deeper than it stood in the nursery or field; and (5) draw a little 
loose soil or leaf litter around the tree as a mulch over the soil. 

The trees should be set at regular intervals, 5 x 5 or 6 x 6 de- 
pending on spacing desired. Two men make a good working unit, 
one digging the holes ; the other setting the trees, carried along in a 
bucket containing water, wet moss or wet burlap. One man planting 
crews may be used very satisfactorily. 

In setting seedlings, take advantage of favorable locations such 
as small openings, natural soil pockets, close by old logs or stumps 
and away from heavy shading bushes or trees. 

A mattock (mattox or mattax) is a good planting tool. Some 
grubbing hoes have a blade that is not too wide and therefore suitable. 
A narrow spade may do well, especially a tilling spade. The hole 
should be large and deep enough to allow spreading of the roots, in- 
cluding the main taproot, in a natural position. If the main roots are 
left bent upward in the hole, the trees soon die. The planter should 
hold the tree in a natural position slightly lower than it formerly stood 
in the plant bed, and gradually fill the hole by drawing fresh soil in 
around the roots, meanwhile pressing the soil about the roots with 
the hands and at least twice with the sole of the shoe. A test of good 
planting is to pull upward on the stem. The tree should be firm with 
no upward "give" to the main stem. Some loose soil or leaf litter 
should be drawn about the tree to act as a mulch in preventing a 
rapid drying of the soil. 

In loose, sandy soil, planting can often be done successfully and 
cheaply with a dibble or planting bar. This tool, shown in figure 12, 
is a narrow, thin, flat iron blade of 7/8-inch iron, tapered in a round- 
ing point and attached to an iron rod as a handle. The tree is set 
by inserting seedling in the slit pushing it down to the bottom of 
slit and pull back up until seedling is at the same ground level as it 
was in the nursery. This is to make sure the seedling roots are not 
turned upward in the slit. The seedling is held in this position by 
one person while another person sinks the dibble about 4 inches back 
of the slit, presses backward to close bottom of the slit then forward 
to close the top. It is sometimes advisable to repeat this process in 
light soils to get the slit properly closed. To complete the planting 
operation the dibblemen's right heel is thrust into the closed slit back 
of the planting seedling to close up any air pocket around the roots. 

After workers get accustomed to the method of planting, a crew 
of two men or boys working in loose soil should set out from 900 
to 1,200 trees, or up to an acre in a day. 

Procedure and details for planting seedlings with both planting 
bar and mattox are shown below in figure 12.

Insert bar as indicated; and pull back 
to free blade, leaving hole deep enough 
for root length, far side of hole straight 
and undisturbed. Keep seevllings m a 
bucket with plenty of wet moss a- 
round the roots. Remove one at a 
time to plant. 

Place seedling at same depth it grew 
in nursery, seeing that root is not 
crooked at bottom of hole, and that 
lateral roots are spread uniformly.

Protection of plantations. Protection of seedlings from fire, 
livestock, diseases and other injuries is \ ary necessary to successful 
survival and grov^th. This is more important during the first fev^ 
years after planting. Detailed discussion on these injuries, controls, 
etc., are found in part VIII of this bulletin, entitled, "Forest Pro- 
tection."

Southern Pines," pp. 2, 3, 4, and 8, Washington, D. C, 1938. (2) United States

Reclaiming eroded land with trees. The amount of erosion on land 
well stocked with forest is amazii^gly low compared to that devoted 
to row crops or even pasture or f^arren land. Too, a reduction in 
erosion, other factors being equal, means greater absorption of water 
by the soil in inverse proportion to the amount of erosion, which in 
turn provides more moisture for crops on the land. 

Certain lands in Mississippi have eroded to such an extent, or 
have such slope and soil types that they will not produce any other 
crops, excepting forests, economically. If the former situation exists 
and yet the slope and soil type is such that it would produce good 
yields from row crops when erosion is controlled, the land might be 
put to forests for a period of time and then back to row crops. 

A study was begun by the Southern Forest Experiment Station 
in 1929 in the silt loam uplands east of the Mississippi River, com- 
prising an area about 500 miles long, and 35 to 100 miles wide. This 
area includes all of the brown loam section of Mississippi and an 
additional strip of land on each side as well. 

Detailed plots were established in 1931 on areas near Holly 
Springs, Mississippi, all differing as to cover type and land use. A 
summary of these results are shown below, as well as a summarized 
discussion of same.

The soil loss from the black locust plantation was undoubtedly 
femaller than the data indicated ; disturbances on this plot during the 
first 5 months of the study caused abnor^.^J erosion, as is indicated 
by the fact that almost 50 percent or tne total soil loss occurred dur- 
ing that period. Soil losses from the barren and cultivatea plots were 
enormous, and were proportionate with the run-off from these plots. 

The ratio of the soil lost from the two cultivated plots to that lost 
from each of the oak forest plots was 4,300 to 1 and 1,528 to 1. The 
barren plots lost 3,519 times as much soil as did the forest plots. The 
erosion rate during the 2-year period indicates that the enormous 
rainfall of 1,789 inches would be required to erode a pound of soil 
from a forest plot, but that less than one-half inch rainfall would be 
required to erode a cultivated plot with rows on a slope. The sta- 
bility of the soils havmg a plant cover is further illustrated by a 
calculation as to the number of years needed to erode the upper & 
inches of surface soil under the different systems of land use. 

During the 2-year period, the indicated run-off from an acre 
of cultivated land totaled 6 acre-feet, while run-off from an acre of 
iorest land amounted to but little more than 1 acre-inch. 

The ability of soils having a forest or grass cover, to absorb 
practically all the rainfall demonstrates that such vegetation is very 
valuable in the storage and holding of water that would otherwise 
be destructive. 

That forestry, pasture development, and the production of forage 
cover crops are types of land management deserving wider usage 
is also implied by the results of this study. 

The study has disclosed evidence on several points relating to 
forest management. The data indicate that an inferior cover of scrub 
oak possesses distinct value for the protection of watersheds. They 
bring out also the extent to which the protective efficiency of forest 
cover can be reduced by annual fires and other abuses. Thus the 
scrub oak stand, which has replaced old-growth oak forest, permitted 
a soil loss 15 times as great as that permitted by normal forest cover 
and a rainfall loss by direct run-off 10 times as great. A cover of 
black locust and Osage-orange, established less than 23 years previous^ 
ly, was found to have converted an eroded abandoned field into a 
stable site capable of absorbing 98 percent of the rainfall. Analysis 
of the soil of the planted area showed 3 percent of organic matter in 
the upper 6-inch layer or in the same proportion as occurs in the

PART IV 

HARDWOOD TIMBER 

Hardwoods are important in certain sections in Mississippi. 
This is true in the Delta counties, the larger river bottoms of the 
State, and in the brown loam counties. They thrive well on most 
bottomlands, in fact to the extent that they crowd out the pine timber. 
Since they are better adapted to bottomlands than pine trees, it is im- 
portant that farmers know how to manage hardwood forests in order 
to derive most from hardw^oods where they are grown. 

Roughly estimated, 40 percent of the Delta's 4.2 million acres of 
land is in woods ; or about one and one-half million acres. The bottom- 
land forest area of the Mississippi Valley totals 13 1/2 millon acres 
out of the South-wide total of 28 million. The major portion of the 
Delta forests is in the backwater area above Vicksburg, along the 
Mississippi River on lands not protected by levees, and in the poorly 
drained interstream depressions or valleys. Eighty percent of this 
acreage is held by owners of cotton plantations, .v^ith more than two- 
thirds of it in holdings less than 1,000 acres. W . th the exception of 
the backwater area there are few unbroken for^?t areas remaining. 

'^Southern Forestry, A Study of the South's Renewable Natural 
Resources," prepared and published by the Illinois Central System, 
has this to say about hardwoods: **No single species of Southern 
hardw^ood has the economic importance of the pines, but taken to- 
gether the hardwoods support important and substantial lumber, 
flooring, millwork, furniture, plywood, cooperage, box, and related 
industries in the South." 

Just as it takes a long time to rebuild exhausted soils, so does 
it take years to produce a new crop of timber when you have to begin 
with seedlings. Growth rates, management, sales, in the relatively 
short period of 5 years, have already proven we can take the woods 
we have and make them pay their way as they are restored to sus- 
tained, quality yield. 

There are innumerable practical things correlated with manage- 
ment that the average farmer can do, based on the research work at 
Stoneville Branch Experiment Station. An outstanding example is 
the utilization of poorer species for fence posts after preservative 
treatment. 

The hardw^ood forest at Stoneville is typical of much of the woods 
of the entire Delta; the actual cutting and utilization is typical of 
what might be done on any plantation, and the results are typical of 
what the average landowner might expect from forest farming. To 
this, however, might well be added a word of warning from Mr. 
Maisenhelder, Delta Unit Forester, "Even though the Delta Experi- 
mental Forest is typical of most of the Delta woods, unfortunately 
there are some areas in worse condition and ovmers of the latter areas 
cannot expect as good returns as we have had."

RESULTS OF RESEARCH 

A special study was started several years ago by the Agriculti.ral 
Experiment Station, at Stoneville, Mississippi, in cooperation with i he 
Southern Forest Experiment Station, New Orleans, Louisiana. 1 his 
study with its various phases covered the entire woodland area of 
the Mississippi Delta. 

Tree cutting in the Delta some 30 years ago was done to take out 
sawlogs; even then, only in certain varieties. Since that time, con- 
tinued carelss logging, fuelwood cutting, and fire, have destroyed a 
large part of our woodlands. However, at Stoneville, since 1939, 
tree cutting has been done for the purpose of improving the quality 
of a growing forest in an attempt to bring back to productivity and 
beauty a typical Delta bottomland woods. The growth in the Delta 
Experimental Forest was originally logged about 1913 and up until 
October, 1939, had been burned over frequently and had suffered all 
the abuses of trespassing. Consequently, the woods were full of 
relatively worthless trees, and very poorly stocked with trees of good 
quality and high value. The tract before 1939 was, unfortunately,, 
typical of the majority of our woodlands today. 

GROWTH RATES 

The improvement cutting that has taken place on over 2,000 acres 
at Stoneville, include some 24 different tree species. However, since 
the stands were not fully stocked and since the test is not old enough, 
it is impossible to show at this point the value of proper management 
in hardwoc forests. Research indicates, however, that with proper 
management, the Delta hardwood forests' annual production could 
be increased from the very low rate of 119 board feet per year per 
acre up to 300 or maybe as much as 500 board feet. 

COMPARISON OF INCREMENT AND DRAIN 

During the years 1932 and 1938, the volume of saw timber and 
growing stock decreased about 2 percent. The matter of timber size, 
timber quality, and maintenance of a desirable proportion of more 
valuable species was less favorable. More than half of the saw- 
timber drain was the manufacture of lumber, veneer, and cooperage, 
and came largely from the stock of higher-quality timber of the more 
valuable species. Even for other uses, the general practice is, and 
has been for a long time, to select the better trees for cutting and to 
leave trees of low quality and less valuable species. Regardless of the 
seasons back of such practice, the result of it is reflected in a high 
proportion of low-grade trees and less valuable species in many of the 
present stands. Reversal of this trend will depend largely on the 
extent to which timber comes to be handled as a crop instead of aa 
something that just grows. 

From 1932 through 1937, the saw-timber drain on the growing 
stock has tended to increase. From a surplus of growth over drain 
of 23 million board feet in 1932, the situation has shifted to deficit 



46 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



of growth of 68 million board feet in 1937. In 1938, owing to a 
sharp decline in commodity drain arising from lowered demand, this 
trend was reversed. Since then, however, and particularly in 1940, 
it is estimated that the deficit of saw-timber increment in relation to 
drain is higher than it was 3 years previously. 

IMPROVEMENT CUTTINGS 

As a result of the above mentioned study, directions were develop- 
ed for making improvement cuttings. 

SETTING UP CUTTINGS STANDARDS 

There are no hard and fast rules for the making of improved 
cuttings. In general terms, poor trees are cut and good trees are left. 
Since these terms are very indefinite, some cutting rules or recom- 
mendations should be followed as a guide in making such cuttings. 

First, however, there are some considerations that affect the 
decision as to whether or not any given tree should be cut in an im- 
provement cutting, namely: (1) species, (2) size, (3) form and quali- 
ty, (4) vigor and thrift, and (5) position and space occupied. These 
five considerations are discussed in order below. 

Species. There are many separate species of trees in most 
bottomland hardwood forests and they are best considered in three 
separate groups, namely: "best", ''intermediate", and "poorest", 
based primarily upon commercial values. These species are listed 
below according to this grouping. 



Poorest species (weeds) 

Box elder 

Hawthorn 

Waterlocust 

Planertree 

Ironwood 

Swamp privet 



Intermediate species 

Overcup oak 

White elm 

Rock elm 

Winged elm 

Hackberry 

Willow 

Red maple 

Sweet pecan 

Bitter pecan 

Hickories 

Honeylocust 

Sycamore 

Blackgum 

Swamp Cottonwood 



Best species 

Bottomland 
Willow oak 
Water oak 
Cherry oak 
Cow oak 
Cottonwood 
White ash 
Green ash 
Redgum 
Persimmon 
Mulberry 
Cypres* 



red oak 



Size. Two size classes are considered here: Under-sawlog size 
and sawlog size. The boundary line between these two classes is set 
arbitarily at 14 inches d.b.h. and a good lower limit in an improvement 
cutting is about 5 inches, d.b.h. 

Form ^-nd quality. The goal of management here is assumed to 
be production of straight, high-quality logs, suitable in large sizes for 
lumber and veneer, and small sizes for cooperage, etc. These are 
logs for which there is a good market and are referred to as high 
grade logs. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI

Vigor and thrift. From this standpoint, there are two classes of 
trees that always should be removed in an improvement cutting :(1) 
''poor risks", and (2) ''over-mature trees". A "poor risk" is a tree 
containing good material that is unlikely to live until the next im- 
provement cutting is made. An "over-mature tree" is one that has 
already attained large size for its species and shows some evidence 
of decreases in vigor and quality. This may be recognized by slower 
growth rates, scanty and pale foliage, crowns with large dead 
branches at the top. 

Position and space occupied. This consideration is important 
mainly where most of the trees are desirable. Only three classes of 
trees need be considered here: (1) trees with poor growing space — 
those that are overtopped by others or seriously crowded by trees 
of similar or large size; (2) trees that interfere with better trees — 
those so closely spaced as to prevent best development of better in- 
dividuals; and (3) wolf trees — those with unusually large crowns 
occupying excessive space and which usually are of low quality and 
have short trunks. 

CUTTING RULES 

It is impossible to make a specific statement as to how far to go 
in removing undesirable trees. It may be determined by the size of 
the area to be improved and the extent to which the forest products 
can be used or sold. However, the principle that the poorest trees 
should always be removed first, seems to be applicable in all cases. 
In the suggested cutting rules presented below, it is -probably best 
to make the first cutting light, removing only the very poorest trees. 
If a heavier cutting seems desirable, the second set of rules might be 
used. For a still heavier cutting, the third set of rules should be 
added. Going beyond this point is probably inadvisable except under 
certain conditions such as the immediate need for a large volume of 
wood per unit of area or where the stand is well or over-stocked. If 
such a cutting is made, the fourth set of rules should be used. 

Trees cut according to the suggested rules below should be cut 
into products of greatest value or use. Trees that are of no value or 
use should be girdled or poisoned. 

Cut first: (1) poor risks, (2) trees seriously decayed or grubby, 
hence likely to decrease in value, (3) over-mature trees, which have 
passed their optimum development and should be harvested before 
further deterioration occurs, and (4) sawlog-size trees of the poorest 
species that do not contain at least one high-grade log, and of inter- 
mediate species that do not contain at least one usable log. 

Cut second: (1) Trees of the poorest or intermediate species, re- 
gardless of size that do not or will never contain at least one high- 
grade log and are either (a) wolf trees (occupying excessive space), 
or (b) trees that will have poor growing space even after the im- 
provement cutting. (2) Trees of the poorest or intermediate species 
that interfere seriously with the growth of better trees (a) of the best 
species at least 4 inches in d.b.h., or (b) of intermediate species at 
least 6 inches in d.b.h. 



48 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



Cut 'f^drd: (1) Remaining sawlog-size trees of the poorest species 
regardless of position or quality. (2) under-sawlog size trees of the 
poorest or intermediate species that interfere seriously with the 
growth of better trees (a) of the best species at least 1 inch in d.b.h. 
or (b) of intermediate species at least 4 inches in d.b.h. (3) Sawlog- 
size of intermediate species that do not contain at least one high-grade 
log, or that are very large wolf trees not containing more than one 
high-grade log. (4) Under-sawlog-size trees of the best species that 
(a) will never contain at least one high-grade log and will have poor 
growing space even after improvement cutting, or (b) interfere 
seriously with better trees of intermediate or best species at least 
4 inches in d.b.h. (5) Wolf trees of the best species that do not or 
will never contain at least one high-grade log, or more than one high- 
grade log if more than 20 inches d.b.h., unless needed for seed, and 
(6) sawlog-size trees of the best species that do not contain at least 
one usable log, unless needed for seed. 

Cut fourth: (1) Remaining under-sawlog-size trees of the poorest 
species ; (2) remaining under-sawlog-size trees of intermediate species 
that will never contain at least one high-grade log; and (3) remain- 
iuo; trees of the best species that do not or will not contain at least one 
merchantable or usable log, unless needed for seed. 

COTTONWOOD PLANTING 

Cottonwood is in demand for a great variety of uses and usually 
brings a good stumpage price. Rapid growth and relatively high 
value makes cottonwood a very desirable tree to grow in plantations. 

Idle lands cost money as do those areas badly in need of reforesta- 
tion. The Delta needs a tree to put these acres into production. Be- 
cause cottonwood produces wood faster than any other tree in the 
Delta and is a general purpose wood that finds a ready market as 
lumber, pulpwood, and for other purposes, the propagation of cotton- 
wood by cuttings and seedlings has been a subject of intensive study 
since 1937 at the Stoneville Branch Experiment Station. 

Farmers who have marginal or submarginal agricultural lands 
that need to be planted to trees or who own batture lands will be in- 
terested in the bulletin, "Planting Cottonwood on Bottomlands", pub- 
lished by the Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station, State 
College, Mississippi, and prepared by Henry Bull and H. H. Muntz. 
Recommendations on planting are summarized in the above-mentioned 
bulletin as follows : 

"(1) Plant only on bottomland sites that are neither extremely 
dry in the late summer and fall, nor deeply flooded in the winter and 
spring. Sites so sandy and dry or so low and often flooded, that 
they support little or no natural vegetation, are not suitable for 
cottonwood. 

"(2) Plant at 6-foot intervals in plowed furrows 10 feet apart. 
If the planting site is densely covered with undesirable vegetation, 
burn or disk the area before plowing. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



49 



"(3) Plant during the winter, when cottonwood is dormant, pre- 
ferably in February. 

*'(4) Plant 1- or 2-year-old cottonwood seedlings collected from 
natural stands or grown in nurseries. Trim the roots to a length of 
15 inches or less (to a point where the taproot is stiff enough to in- 
sert in the planting hole), and the tops to 10 inches. Make 20-inch 
cuttings from the tops thus cut off. 

"(5) Plant seedlings with a rod that makes a hole V2-inch in 
diameter and 15-inches deep. Plant cuttings '/ to the same depth 
with a rod that makes a hole 14-inch in diameter, or if the ground 
is soft simply push them in. 

"(6) Release the trees from the competition of other vegetation 
at least once and preferably twice during their first growing season 
by hoeing away all vegetation within about 18 inches of each tree 
before it is overtopped. 

"(7) Protect the trees from fire and grazing/' 

Those carrying on these studies believe that the main problem 
now is one of developing a cheap and satisfactory means of cultivation 
• during the first year after planting in order to eliminate weed 
competition. Trees of pulpwood size can be grown on favorable 
sites in about 10 years. One planter of the Delta has a small cotton- 
wood plantation with a survival of above 80 percent. 

To complement the regeneration work on cottonwood, tests are 
now underway on various methods of producing cottonwood planting 
stock at low cost. Unless a convenient source of natural seedlings 
is available, nursery-grown cuttings from closely planted rootstocks 
appear now to hold the greatest promise. 

1/ More recent studies at Stone ville favors the use of cuttings made from 1- and 
2-year-old cottonwood seedlings. The cuttings are made about 19 inches long with 
15 inches planted below ground level leaving 4 inches above ground.

PART V 

NAVAL STORES PRODUCTION 

It is generally known that the outmoded but unshed name of the 
naval stores industry was derived from the former uses of its products 
for caulking wooden ships and for preservative treatment of their 
rigging. 

Pines and some other cone-bearing trees, when wounded, exude 
a mixture of turpentine and resin acids. The mixture is an oleoresin 
or crude gum. This gummy fluid is not the sap of the tree; it is a 
secretion found in a network of minute openings called resin ducts. 
When crude gum is heated, the turpentine is distilled off and the 
residue, upon congealing, forms rosin. In former times, when rosin 
was considered almost worthless, crude gum was called crude turpen- 
tine or simply turpentine, and the volatile fraction of the gum waa 
known as spirits of turpentine. 

Gum or crude turpentine is a valuable and important product of 
certain species of pine in Mississippi. In recent years, especially^ 
farm income in certain counties in the southern area of Mississippi 
has been materially increased through naval stores production, par- 
ticularly where good turpentining practices were used. This has 
been particularly true during the past several years with advanced 
prices of crude gum. This phase of forest industry will probably 
become more important in the future with the growing scarcity of 
turpentine timber. 

LONGLEAF AND SLASH PINES— GUM PRODUCERS 

There are only two species of pine in Mississippi that producet 
crude gum economically, namely, longleaf and slash. 

Longleaf pine possesses two qualities which make it a profitable 
forest tree in Mississippi: (1) It grows on the driest and deepest 
sandy soils and on wet lands. (2) It withstands to an uncommon 
degree the injurious effects of fire. 

Slash pine excels all other native pines in quantity of gum which 
flows from the trees when chipped. Its gum, when freshly exuded, 
is clear and about the color of light-yellow honey. As compared with 
longleaf or "hill" yellow pine, its nearest competitor, slash pine yields 
from its dip and scrape combined, a slightly higher percentage of 
spirits of turpentine and a higher grade of rosin. In contrast to 
longleaf it produces only a little scrape. 

SELECTING TURPENTINE FARMING AS A BUSINESS 

Before a farmer goes into turpentine farming he should con« 
sider the following : 

1. Determine whether or not timber is suitable for turpentine 
purposes. In all cases when it is planned to place timber 
into naval stores production, it should first be determined 
whether or not the timber is suitable for turpentining pur- 
poses. Several factors should be considered in reaching thi» 
decision, among which are: 



52 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



A. The class of timber. Only longleaf and slash pines 
should be used. A comparison of the value of an acre 
for sawlogs, poles, and pulpwood, at its stands, should 
always be made with its value for the same purposes 
after having been worked for turpentine, to determine 
whether or not the turpentine profits will equal or ex- 
ceed the reduction of the timber value for other pur- 
poses. 

B. Accessibility. Timber highly suitable for turpentine is 
often found in almost inaccessible swamps and bays. 
Such timber should not be cupped because high water 
may prevent its being worked for a portion of the sea- 
son, and the hauling costs may become prohibitive 
during such times. 

C. Density of stand. Area being worked for turpentine at 
the present time averages 19 faces per acre. This av- 
erage includes the entire acreage, both hill and swamp 
lands. Areas affording less faces per acre is probably 
not ripe for turpentining, and should be left until more 
trees come into the diameter specifications. A farmer 
who plans to do his own work may cup a more scattered 
area than if he must hire the work done, due to the re- 
luctance of turpentine labor to work scattered areas. 
This is particularly true where the labor is paid on a 
piece-work basis (per thousand faces or per barrel of 
dip). 

2. Determine ivhether or not landoioner is in position to go into 
turpentine farming. In deciding this point careful con- 
sideration should be given the following factors : 

A. Time to do necessary work or supervise same. It is 
essential that timber be worked regularly to obtain 
maximum yields. Therefore timber owners not having 
sufficient time to do this or to properly supervise the 
work should not attempt gum farming. It is un- 
desirable to streak timber every 3 to 4 weeks, and spend 
the remainder of the time working other farm crops. 
In no case should more than 2 weeks elapse between 
streaks. 

B. Financial condition. It requires a considerable and im- 
mediate cash outlay to go into turpentine farming. It 
is, of course, necessary that farmers be in a position 
to finance the business. 

C. Availability of market. Markets should be near enough 
to the producer so that the cost of hauling to market 
will be within reason. It is also true that several mar- 
kets within reach create keener competition for gum, 
sometimes resulting in higher prices to the farmer. 

D. Transportation or hauling equipment. In the event the 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



53 



farmer does not own a truck with which to haul his gum 
to market, he should build a small ramp on the best road 
of his forest and bunch his barrels of dip there by means 
of a wagon or ''slide", to be picked up by the truck en- 
gaged to do his hauling. 

YIELDS OF CRUDE GUM 

The long-range production trend has been definitely downward, 
and is due largely to a combination of two factors: (1) decrease in 
the size and number of trees available for turpentining; and (2) 
increasing competition from other raw materials, notably mineral 
spirits and wood naval stores products. 

In today's scattered stands, the turpentine worker spends ap- 
proximately two-thirds of his time walking from tree to tree. He 
can chip an average of only 5,000 faces per week, as compared to the 
10,000-face crop which his grandfather worked in the more fully 
stocked virgin forests of his day. Moreover, because the timber is 
considerably smaller than in the virgin forest, the yield per tree is 
much less. Thus, because of decrease in tree size and number per 
acre, the season's production of each turpentine chipper has fallen to 
not more than one-quarter of what it was 50 years ago. 

TURPENTINE ORCHARDS COMPARED WITH NATURAL STANDS 

The scattered second-growth stands of the turpentine belt aver- 
age about 20 working trees per acre. Although fire protection, tur- 
pentining and cutting practices have improved in recent years, pro- 
gress toward better stocking has been slow. Most of the timber is 
handled according to a naval-stores-dominated system of management 
which is not conducive to the building up or maintenance of well- 
stocked stands of slash and long-leaf pines. The trees are relatively 
small, averaging only 11 to 12 inches in diameter at breast height, 
because of almost universal tapping as soon as they reach 9 inches 
in diameter. Gum yields are accordingly low, averaging about 8.3 
pounds per tree per year. Per acre production thus amounts to only 
166 pounds of gum per season. 

Further inefficiency results from the wide range in tree sizes 
found in the average stands. The larger trees generally produce 
more gum and fill their cups faster, so to avoid loss from overflow 
from these trees the entire crop must be dipped long before the 
majority of the cups are full of gum. 

Thus, the large amount of unproductive walking time, the neces- 
sity for frequent gum collection, the low yields per tree and per acre, 
all tend to lower efficiency and increase production costs in the 
average natural second-growth forest. 

Plantations of slash pine have made excellent growth on aban- 
doned fields of low fertility. Trees that were planted on such areas 
in 1930 are now being worked for naval stores under regular com- 
mercial operating procedure. Plantings on better sites would come 
into production much sooner. 



54 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



Assuming that with a planting of slash pine, 12 x 12 foot spacing, 
and that 80 percent of the trees would survive and attain workable 
size at about the same time, a planted turpentine orchard should 
have at least 242 trees per acre. This is more than 12 times the 
number of working trees in the average natural forest at the present 
time. 

SUMMARIZED STATEMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS ON 
TURPENTINE PRACTICES 

In 1923 a number of experiments were started by the Southern 
Forest Experiment Station at Starke, Florida, for the purpose of de- 
termining the best naval stores practice in second-growth slash and 
longleaf pines, the two species that are the main source of naval 
stores in the United States. The practice so determined should supply 
the definite information needed to avoid the severe damage to timber 
stands wrought by present and past turpentining methods and to 
combine profitable, sustained turpentining with timber conservation. 

Summarized statements and conclusions as to the results of these 
experiments are given below. 

The principal studies were undertaken in dense second-growth, 
35-year-old slash pine and open 25-year-old, second-growth longleaf 
pine. 

The height-of-streak test, in which three heights, 0.32, 0.5 and 
0.73 inch, were tried out, revealed the following advantages in favor 
of low chipping : 

Low chipping produces fully as much gum in 5 years' time as 
higher working. 

Low working permits the continuous chipping of one face on 
trees 11 or more inches in diameter for 10 to 12 years, whereas, 
moderately chipped faces are worked out in 7 years and high-chipped 
faces in 5 years. 

This additional working should furnish from 25 to 50 percent 
more gum for each face. 

The longer working period provides a longer healing period be- 
fore back facing is begun and avoids the delay of a long rest period 
before back faces can be put on. 

In naval stores management the longer working period allows for 
sustained operation without interruption, yielding greater returns 
at lower operating costs. 

Where timber is soon to be cut and only a short working period 
is permitted, low chipping reduces damage to the butt log nearly 50 
percent over that resulting from high chipping. 

The low streak results in a smaller amount of damage from dry 
facing. 

The depth-of-streak tests comprised four depths, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 
and 1 inch. The dense slash timber suffered a greater amount of 
damage than would have occurred in more open stands. The results 
obtained in this test revealed the following advantages in favor of 
shallow working: 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



55 



Although different depths of streak produce no significant dif- 
ference in total gum yield from 5 years' working, a greater reduction 
in yield from year to year accompanies the deeper work, indicating 
a considerably lower total yield for deep chipping if the work be 
extended to 7 or more years . 




FIGURE 14 — The slash pine above is 10 inches in diameter at 15 years of age. Note change 
from Number 1 to 00 back. 



Eleven-inch or larger trees may be worked with shallow streaks 
for 7 years (or even longer with lower streaks) before the gum 
yields are reduced to an unprofitable point, as opposed to 5 years' 
work with deep chipping. Mechanical weakening of the trees is 
avoided. 

On shallow-chipped slash, dry faces are only one-third as numer- 
ous as on deeply chipped slash pine. Injury from insect and fungus 
attacks on dry faces is correspondingly lessened. 

In the width-of-face tests, two series of face widths were used — 
in one case one-fourth, one-half, and three-fourths of the circum- 
ference, and in the other case one-fourth, one-third and three-eighths. 

Only 5 years' work is possible on the 75 percent faces, because 
the extreme width of face precludes the possibility of back facing. 
Three sets of faces, covering a minimum of 15 years, are possible 



56 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



on the narrow-faced group without intermediate resting periods, and 
one set of back faces on medium-faced (50 percent) trees. Total 
yields for wide, medium, and narrow faces may thus be estimated 
at 168.8, 262.5, and 372 barrels of turpentine per crop, respectively. 

The second series of tests showed that the groups of faces that 
are one-third and three-eighths of circumference, yielded, respective- 
ly, 8 and 9 percent more than the narrow faces. However, three sets 
of faces may he cut in succession without interruption on the 
one-fourth circumference group, whereas some resting period may 
be required in the case of the wider faces before the trees can be 
worked with two sets of back faces. 

A study of density of stand as it affects gum yields and the 
ability of the trees to be turpentined without damage indicated that 
more open-growing trees yield considerably more than trees in 
dense stands, and that there is less reduction in yield from year to 
year where the trees have plenty of space. A study of yield in re- 
lation to crown size indicated that more gum is obtained from the 
trees with larger crowns. Furthermore, on these large-crowned 
trees growing in the open there is less dry facing and faces heal more 
rapidly than in crow ded stands. 

A study of the effect of diameter size on naval stores yield 
brought out the fact that yields increase with size of tree and that 
trees smaller than 9 inches cannot be chipped with any assurance 
of obtaining a satisfactory profit unless the market prices are high 
or the trees considerably more vigorous than the average. 

All chipping resulted in a reduction of diameter growth rate. 
This reduction increased with greater height of streak, greater depth 
of streak, and the use of two simultaneous faces as opposed to single 
faces. 

Studies in 1920 by the U. S. Forest Service in Florida showed 
that growth of 1-face trees was reduced 27 percent and 2-face trees 
were reduced 40 percent. 

Turpentining in fairly open longleaf stands apparently did not 
affect the ability of the trees to produce cones. 

Dry facing is an important item in naval-stores management as 
it impairs the value of lumber and increases the likelihood of further 
degrade caused by insects and fungi. Dry facing is more serious in 
slash pine stands than in longleaf. It increases with density of stand 
and with greater depth of chipping and is normally more serious 
whenever any other destructive agencies have weakened the trees. 

The principal insect associated with turpentining work is the 
turpentine borer (Buprestis apricons). Damage by this borer may 
be kept under control by the use of conservative methods, such as 
shallow chipping and the cutting of narrow faces. Tacking tins and 
avoiding the use of ax cuts in the face also reduces the likelihood of 
damage from these borers. 

The whole series of tests show that timber may be chipped for 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI

a much longer time than under present commercial methods, with 
a higher sustained yield and less damage to the trees, provided low 
streaks, shallow streaks, and narrow faces are used. Also, if work 
is confined to trees above 9 inches in diameter, well spaced, and wit>i 
plenty of crown, gum yields may be considerably increased. The 
results from all the stands under observation at Starke indicate chat 
annual mortality in second-growth turpentine stands may be kept 
down to 0.5 percent, provided conservative methods are employed. 

The latest detailed experimental information on turpentining 
practices may be secured from Southern Forest Experiment Station, 
New Orleans, Louisiana.

THE USE OF CHEMICAL STIMULANTS TO INCREASE GUM YIELDS 

Research during recent years have proven that various chemical 
stimulants have increased gum yield from longleaf and slash pines, 
iVTany different stimulants have been used and all the acids used 
caused some stimulation of gum flow with certain concentrations. 
However, only two were consistently outstanding in promoting large 
increases in gum production, namely, sulphuric and hydrochloric 
acid. Of the two acids, sulphuric seems to be superior as a stimu- 
lant. 

In addition to increased flow of gum it seems that the number 
of chippings can be reduced by the use of these stimulants. One of 
the biggest problems encountered in the use of these stimulants has 
been developing a satisfactory way of applying them to the streaks 
or faces. Research is still active in the various phases of this work 
and positive conclusions have not been made as to the best practices 
in applying stimulants which increases gum flow. Therefore detailed 
results of experiments to date are not included in this bulletin.. For 
those who are interested in this subject it is suggested that for 
information on progress from time to time they may contact the 
Southern Forest Experiment Station, New Orleans, Louisiana. 

It might be added that no tree that has been in the experiment 
thus far has been killed by chemical treatments, and most important, 
^trees that are now in their fourth year of treatment are still produc- 
ing more gum than those not treated. 

Another important fact is that from results thus far neither the 
acid or caustic soda treatment has had any effect on resin grades.

PART VI 

PRESERVATIVE TREATMENTS OF FARM TIMBER 

The quality of wood used on the farms of the country and ex- 
posed to decay is very great. The total is difficult to estimate, but 
it undoubtedly amounts to several billion board feet annually. This 
wood is used in various forms, such as fence posts, buildings, bridges, 
culverts, shingles, telephone poles, silos, vine stakes, and small* build- 
ings. For such uses durability is usually of great importance. 

Some woods resist decay better than others. A post of one kind 
of wood may last 10 years or more, while one of another kind may 
last only two years under the same conditions. There is also a great 
difference in the durability of wood of the same species under dif- 
ferent conditions. When the posts are actually submerged in water 
or a very dry situation they will last longer than in a situation 
where the ground is simply damp or alternately wet and dry. It will 
last better in a compact clay soil than in a loose sandy soil. A warm, 
moist climate is more favorable to decay than a dry one, or one that 
has long, cold winters. 

Durable woods are continually growing scarcer and higher priced 
in most localities and less durable woods must be used in their stead. 
Many of the non-durable woods in their natural condition will last 
only two or three years in situations favorable to decay. It will 
readily be seen, therefore, that any reasonably cheap method of in- 
creasing their life will save money for the user. 

For a number of years experiments on the preservative treat- 
ment of fence posts, poles, and other forms of timber exposed to de- 
cay, have been made by federal and state forest services in cooperation 
with agricultural experiment stations, farmers, and various com- 
panies. They have proved conclusively that when a suitable preserva- 
tive treatment is given posts or poles that would ordinarily rot quickly 
they can be made to last 12 to 25 years and that similar resistance to 
decay can be obtained with other forms of timber. 

REQUIREMENTS OF PRESERVATIVES 

There are six important requirements for a preservative for 
general use: (1) it should be safe to use, (2) should be reasonably 
cheap, (3) should penetrate wood readily, (4) should not be corrosive 
to metal, (5) should not evaporate or wash out of the wood easily, and 
(6) should be poisonous to fungi. For special purposes there are, 
of course, additional requirements. 

Details are given below for preservative treatment of fence posts 
with Pentachlorophenol, which, according to the Mississippi Agricul- 
tural Experiment Station, shows promise of being a practical, ef- 
ficient method of preserving farm timbers. 

If details are desired on various other methods of preservative 
treatments, they may be secured by writing the Mississippi Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station for Bulletin No. 439, "Fence Posts: 
Production and Treating Costs", by W. C. Hopkins, November, 1946.

PENTACHLOROPHENOL COLD SOAKING TREATMENT 
FOR FENCE POSTS' 

Recent experiments at State College have shown that fence posts 
can be satisfactorily treated by an inexpensive and simple method 
which requires little equipment and which promises a service life 
of 12 to 20 years per post. The following sets forth in detail the 
procedure to be followed in using the pentachlorophenol cold soaking 
treatment on fence posts. 

EQUIPMENT NEEDED 

The only equipment required is a watertight tank six inches 
longer than the longest post to be treated. The tank may be any 
convenient depth and width. A rectangular tank about 2' x 2' x 8* 
is suggested. 

The tank may be built of 2" x 12" tongue-and-grove lumber 
caulked with cotton, red lead or some other caulking material. One 
hundred twelve board feet of 2" x 12" lumber is required for a tan<k 
2' X 2' X 8'. Needed are six pieces eight feet long and four pieces 
two feet long. Such a tank will hold 12 to 20 posts of 4" to 6" in 
diameter and will require about 150 gallons of preservative to start 
with. If posts longer than 71/2 feet are to be treated, the tank must 
be accordingly longer. 

PRESERVATIVE 

Pentachlorophenol concentrated solution, diluted with No. 2 fuel 
oil in the proportions recommended by the manufacturer may be ob- 
tained from: 



Chapman Chemical Company 
Pere Marquette Building 
New Orleans, Louisiana 
or 

Memphis 9, Tennessee 

Wood Treating Chemicals Company 
St. Louis, Missouri 



Permatox Concentrate which is used one 
gallon of concentrate to ten gallons of 
fuel oil. 



Timbertox concentrate as well as per- 
matox should be mixed with fuel oil so 
that a 5 percent solution is obtained. 
Follow manufacturer's instructions on 
container to obtain this mixture. 

Monsanto Chemicals Company "Permassan 60". Ready to use. 

St. Louis, Missouri 

The concentrates cost about $2.00 per gallon, and fuel oil costs 
about 10 cents per gallon. The preservative solution recommended 
— 1 gallon of concentrate to 10 gallons of fuel oil — would, therefore, 
cost about 27 cents, or 7 cents per quart of solution. Approximate 
cost of solution per treated post may be figured from table 11 below, 
showing number of quarts of preservative solution required for posts 
of different sizes. Examples : posts 6-7 feet long, 3-4 inches diameter 
at top, will require 1 quart of solution, costing 7 cents each; posts 
8-9 feet long, 5-6 inches diameter, will require 3 quarts of solution, 
costing 21 cents each.

TREATMENT 

Posts must be well peeled (all bark, both outer and inner re- 
moved) and dried for at least 60 days in the summer and 120 days 
in the winter. Peeling is most .easily done in the spring. Figure 22 
shows simple tools for peeling posts. Figure 23 shows a mechanical 
peeling machine, 

Assort posts for treating, placing those of the same length, 
diameter, and species together. Figure 24 shows a good method of 
stacking posts. 




FIGURE 24 — Fence posts peeled and stacked for seasoning period of 60 days in summer, 120 days 
in winter. They will then be ready for preservative treatments. Posts peeled by chain barker at Newton 
Branch Experiment Station of Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station. 



66 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 




FIGURE 25 — Machine peeled (chain barker) does better job of removing inner bark than hand 
peeled posts as shown in picture. The three posts on top, foreground were hand peeled, the rest machine 
peeled. Machine peels pine posts at rate of 50-75 per hour, oak, ironwood, and sweetgum 20-35 per 
hour. Posts must be freshly cut in March-April and May to get best results from peeling. Work donp 
at Newton Branch Station, Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station. 

Place posts in tank leaving a minimum of 8 inches from the to)) 
of tank down to top layer of posts. Barely cover posts with preserva- 
tive. Then determine number of quarts to be absorbed by each batch 
of posts by referring to table 11. For example, 20 posts 3 to 4 inches 
in diameter, 7 feet long would require 20 quarts of preservative to 
treat properly. Thus, you would add 20 quarts of preservative to 
that already in the tank (which already barely covers the posts). 
Weight posts down to prevent floating and leave posts in tank 
until preservative drops back to the level where posts oegan to show 
above fluid. Remove posts from tank, stack to dry, then add a new 
batch of posts and repeat process. 

Keep livestock away from treating tank.

PART VII 

MARKETING AND UTILIZATION OF FARM TIMBERS 

MARKETS 

An attempt is made here to show the various classes of products 
that are manufactured in Mississippi from forests; also the names 
and addresses of the manufacturing plants. This means that such 
plants afford available market for various classes of timber. How- 
ever, as shown in discussions below, there are in many cases local 
dealers who buy farm timber and/or products that are in turn sold to 
the manufacturing plants either in Mississippi or elsewhere. 

SAWLOGS 

There is a market for sawlogs or lumber in every county and 
even in most communities in Mississippi. In most cases there is a 
local person who owns a portable or other type sawmill, who yviW 
buy the farmer's timber. Farm timber is sold too often by tracts 
for a given sum of money. In some cases, however, it is sold subject 
to a log or lumber scale, or the standing timber is estimated, either of 
which is a better method than selling for a lump-sum without esti- 
mating or measuring the timber to be sold. 

PULPWOOD 

Farmers in most communities of Mississippi can market pulp- 
wood either to local buyers or receivers or by delivering the timber to 
plants. The Masonite Plant, Laurel; Flintkote Plant, Meridian; 
Gypsum Plant, Greenville; and International Paper Mill of Pasca- 
goula, are all located within the State. Several out-of-state mills 
have local representatives at various railroad points, almost through- 
out the State, who will buy either standing pulpwood timber, or buy it 
cut and stacked at the farm, or delivered to the railroad. 

Having available markets for pulpwood is very important. 
Where thinning of small trees is necessary, the timber can be sold for 
pulpwood, thereby giving farmers wages for their time in doing a 
necessary job and, also, a market for timber that might otherwise 
be wasted. 

PULP AND BOARD MILLS 

Below is a list of plants in Mississippi and neighboring states 
that provide markets for pulpwood : 

Paper Mills 

Name of firm (handle unpeeled wood) Addresses 

Gaylord Container Corporation Bogalusa, Louisiana 

Brown Paper Company Monroe, Louisiana 

Southern Craft Division of International Bastrop and Springfield, Louisiana, 

Paper Company Mobile, Ala., Pascagoula, Miss. 

Gulfstates Paper Company Tuscaloosa, Alabama 

Hollingsworth & Whitney Mobile, Alabama 

National Gypsum Mobile, Alabama 

Board Mills 

Flintkote Company Meridian, Mississippi 

Masonite Corporation Laurel, Mississippi 

United States Gypsum Company Greenville, Mississippi 

Meade Corporation Kingsport, Tennessee 

The last three companies use only peeled wood and they also use hardwoods 
with the exception of Oak, hickory, and dogwood.

POLES, PILING, AND CROSSTIES 



Marketing poles and piling is very important since the price of 
these products is much higher as a rule, when based on the number 
of board feet, then pulpwood or sawlogs. This is true because of 
the scarcity of timber that is of sufficient size and length and straight 
enough to make desirable poles. 

Unlike sawlogs and pulpwood, the markets for poles and piling 
in Mississippi are not so plentiful. However, poles can be shipped 
by rail or delivered by truck to various points in the State. They 
must be creosoted, thus, they are usually delivered to creosoting 
plants regardless of who might buy them. 

In many places very few or no poles are sold and thus there are 
no local buyers. In such cases it may be necessary to contact some 
of the firms that handle these products. 

Below is a list of firms that handle poles, piling, and/or crossties:

There are many local buyers or dealers of crossties in the State 
and they are probably too numerous in number to list at this point 
However, practically all crossties are bought directly for or sold to 
creosoting companies; therefore, if there is not a local market for 
crossties, farmers might contact the nearest creosote company for 
information on prices, delivery points and names of buyers. 

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS 

There are quite a few special products made from forest timbers 
in Mississippi, namely, boxes and crates, building materials, caskets, 
shuttle blocks, farm implements, furniture, implement handles, sash 
doors, staves, trailers and bodies, veneer board, wagons, prefabricat- 
ed houses, and shipbuilding repairs. The towns where some or 
most of these various products are made are listed below: 

Chemical naval stores and by-products from pine stumps. Plants 
are located in Laurel, Hattiesburg, Gulfport, Columbia, and Picayune.

72 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



ridian, Lucedale, Canton, Newton, Ecru, Pontotoc, and Mendenhall, 
in which various items, too numerous to list, are manufactured. 
However, these shops provide a market for a limited amount of 
various kinds of timber, principally hardwoods. 

There are quite a few plants in the State that produce gum, 
turpentine, arfd resin from crude gum. However, naval stores are 
discussed in another chapter in this bulletin and these plants are 
listed in that section.

in Mississippi," p. 10 to 52, Jackson, Mississippi. January, 1943. 

SELLING TIMBER ON A GRADE BASIS, ALSO DELIVERED PRICES 

vs. FARM PRICES 

In the table below is shown comparisons of estimated returns 
from saw-timber, pulpwood, crossties and piling, on the stump and de- 
livered to the railhead. This table might be helpful to the farmer in 
deciding what type of product to sell and whether or not to sell on the 
stump or deliver to local markets. 

The prices used in making these estimates were estimated aver- 
age prices received in 1945 by farmers in Mississippi. The volumes 
in board feet w^ere calculated from the Scribner Decimal C. Rule 
which is about equal to green lumber tally for a portable sawmill. 

The prices used for products delivered to the railhead are for 
processed products in the case of saw-timber and crossties and are 
probably not comparable to pulpwood and piling.

From the above table and figures it can be readily seen that the 
farmer's income from timber depends to a large degree on the type 
of product sold, when it is sold, and whether or not it is processed. 
Table 16 shows that a 48-foot tree, 12 inches d.b.h., containing 110 
board feet could be sold for $0.36 or $1.44 at the stump using the two 
price extremes or the high and low possibles. Delivered to the rail- 
head, the tree might be sold for $1.86 or as much as $4.80. It is 
evident from these figures that all pine trees with enough body length 
and that are large and straight enough should be sold for poles or 
piling. If not, they should be sold as sawlogs or made into lumber, 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



73 



if they are 10 inches or more in diameter and not culls. However, 
if a tree is 10 inches in diameter or larger, it may be made into cross- 
ties and bring the farmer more money than if sold for pulpwood. If 
a farmer has plenty of labor at certain times of the year so he may 
manufacture crossties by hand, when he does not have access to a 
sawmill, he can get the additional price shown above. Whether or 
not a farmer cuts his itmber for piling, poles, lumber, or crossties 
should depend upon the grade of the timber. In case it is used for 
lumber or crossties, whether it is manufactured and/or delivered 
to the railhead should be determined by the labor and equipment 
available. 

Information below, including tables, might be helpful to farmers 
in deciding what use should be made of the various kinds and sizes of 
trees on his farm. 

PILING AND POLES 

Table 13 shows the value of various sizes and length of pine trees, 
for piling. The specifications for piling are very exacting because to 
drive them into the ground, top down, they must be sound and abso- 
lutely straight ; also they must have an even and gradual taper from 
butt to top. 

The prices used in tables 13, and 14 are as of December, 1942, 
f.o.b. cars.

Poles are graded into several classes and the specifications are 
not as exacting as they are for piling. Because the poles are set in 
the ground with the small end up, the taper does not need to be exact 
and gradual and there may be small bulges or slight reverse curves 
so long as the pole has a straight line from end to end and is sound. 
Many pines that will not meet the piling specifications will manu- 
facture into poles of good grade and high market value, as shown in

LUMBER 

After the piling and poles have been selected from the timber 
stand, lumber in point of value is next in importance. The most 
commonly used log rules are the International Scribner Decimal C. 
and the Doyle rules. The International rule will give the timber 
grower the greatest volume of board feet of lumber from logs of the 
prevailing second growth timber. 

If it is desirable to sell standing timber for lumber, a fairly ac- 
curate estimate can be made by use of table 15 which is an Inter- 
national log rule table. 

To compute the stumpage of standing trees, using a price of 
$10.00 per thousand board feet, multiply the number of board feet in 
a tree by one cent.

CROSSTIES 

After the piling poles and lumber trees have been selected the 
next wood product in point of value is crossties. Most standard 
gauge railroads use a standard length tie of Si/^-foot and 7V2-foot 
length and one company uses a 9-foot length tie as its standard. The 
most common dimension of standard ties are 7" x 9", 7" x 8", 6" x 8", 
and 6" x 7", and more recently some roads are using ties that are just 
slabbed on two sides to a standard of 7 inches and 6 inches thick. 

The minimum diameters at small end inside bark of logs 8V^ 
feet long that will hew out ties of the standard dimensions are as fol- 
lows: For 7" X 9" ties, minimum diameter of 111/2 inches; for T' x 8" 
ties, minimum diameter of lOl/o inches; for 6" x 8" ties, minimum 
diameter of 10 inches ; for 6" x 7" ties, minimum diameter of 9 inches. 

The approximate number of ties of the varying dimensions that 
may be cut from standing trees may be arrived at by estimating the 
diameter of the tree inside the bark at 8 1/2 f^et from the stump and 
continue up the tree estimating the diameter at points in multiples of 
8 1/2 feet until the diameter of the tree is reduced to minimum of 9 
inches. 



76 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 




FIGURE 29 — Farmers In Wayne County having crossties ins^pected by buyer at railroad siding. 
Farmers today are receiving $0.85 to $1.30 for crossties delivered. 



In the latter part of 1942 and first part of 1943, tie prices for 
814-foot standard dimensions were approximately: for 7" x 9", 
$1.20; 7" X $1.00; 6" x 8", $0.80; 6" x T\ $0.70 f.ob. cars. The 
stumpage value usually runs about 25 percent of the f .o.b. car prices. 

The following table will illustrate the various dimensions of ties 
that may be hewn from 81/^ -foot length logs of minimum diameters 
at small end inside bark and the approximate stumpage value. at 25 
percent of the f .o.b. car prices.

PULPWOOD 

After the piling, poles, lumber and ties have been selected, the 
tops or otherwise waste portion of the pines have a salvage value and 
should be sold as pulpwood or fuelwood. Also thinnings of small 
lumber from thick stands can be used for pulpwood. 

Pulpwood is usually sold by the unit of 160 cubic feet and when 
the sticks are 5 feet long and put into stacks 4 feet high and 8 feet 
long (5' X 4' X 8') it makes a unit. Pulp mills require the sticks to be 
cut usually from 3 inches to 5 inches longer than 5 feet (63 inches to 
65 inches) which runs well over the 160 cubic feet per unit but th« 
price usually remains the unij price. 




FIGURE 30 — Homer Taylor, tenant on farm of C. B. Carlee, Alcorn County. Using his own 
wagon and team, he has cut, peeled, and is shown hauling pulpwood to the railroad car. The farmer 
received from $9.99 to $14.00 per unit for this type of wood loaded on the railroad car. 

The following pulpwood table will serve as a guide for computing 
the approximate number of units that may be cut from standing pines 
of various diameters and heights.

following table :

For an example of comparative value from the above pulpwood 
table, it requires 60 of the average pines at 5 inches d.b.h. to make 
a unit of pulpwood at $2.00 per unit stumpage value, or the stumpage 
value is a fraction over 3 cents per pine. It requires 5 of the average 
pines 12 inches d.b.h. to make a unit of pulpwood at $2.00 per unit 
stumpage value or the stumpage value is 40 cents per pine. 

Where timber is sold for pulpwood, it is very much to the farm- 
er's advantage to cut his own timber during odd times and deliver it 
to the railhead. As shown above, 1000 board feet or 2 units will 
bring about $3.00 stumpage and $15.20 delivered to the railhead. 
Practically all farmers have the horse power and equipment necessary 
to deliver pulpwood to the highway or railhead and by so doing they 
would probably make good wages. Most farmers can also deliver 
crossties to the railhead, while only a small percentage might be able 
to deliver logs, lumber or piling. However, in most cases, they can 
cut their own timber and hire the logs hauled to the market and make 
good wages for the time used in cutting and managing these opera- 
tions. For instance, timber at the present time is about $10.00 per 
thousand board feet stumpage while logs delivered to the railhead 
brings about $20.00, thus a farmer gets $10.00 for cutting and de- 
livering his logs, and the chances are the cutting and hauling would 
cost far less than that amount. Where timber owner and laborers 
cut and deliver logs and pulpwood on a partnership basis, the owner 
should furnish the timber and equipment for delivery and receive 
about 65 percent of the delivered price while labor should receive 
about 35 percent. 

A comparison of the costs of cutting, handling and hauling pulp- 
wood and logs in 1940 and 1945 is shown below in table 20. The in- 
crease in costs is significant. However, a large part of costs is for 
labor. Thus, if a farmer does his own cutting and hauling he can 
provide a good source of wages for himself and other farm labor 
during slack farming seasons.

Reference; Occasional Paper No. 107, "Pulpwood-and Log-Production Costs 
In 1945 as Compared with 1940," page 6, Southern Forest Experiment Station, 
New Orleans, Louisiana. December 1945. 

In summarizing, it might be said that a farmer should sell his 
timber that is ready for marketing ; first, as piling or poles if possible, 
that is, if it is suitable. Timber that will not make piling or poles 
should be sold as sawlogs or made into lumber, if it is of sufficient 
quality, or some of it may be sold for crossties in certain cases. Trees 
which are large enough but do not meet specifications on either of 
these three products should be used for pulpwood. In other words, 
if trees are crooked, limby, or if for other reasons the quality will not 
permit the production of these products, they can be used for pulp- 
wood or may even be used for fuel wood. This does not mean that 
pulpwood is not important or that it is not important to have a market 
for pulpwood because it is very necessary that a large amount^ of 
timber be cut because it is cull timber insofar as lumber, crossties, 
and piling is concerned. It is also necessary that a lot of small 
timber be thinned in order for the timber left to grow at a maximum 
rate. In both cases, this timber can be sold for pulpwood whereas 
it might otherwise be wasted in a large percentage of cases. 

COMPARISON OF VOLUME AND VALUE OF VARIOUS 
SIZE LOGS AND TREES 

Unless small trees are crowded, injured, or for some other reason 
are culls, they should not be cut for market. This is borne out by the 
fact that, as shown in figure 32, a 16-foot log 16 inches in diameter 
contains about 9 times as many board feet as a log 8 inches in diame- 
ter the same length. Also, a log 16-feet long and 24-inches in 
diameter has 25 times as much lumber as one 8 inches in diameter. 
Thus, while a tree triples in diameter it increases in lumber volume 
25 times. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



81 



At the same time, larger trees are usually higher in price since 
more valuable timbers can be cut from larger trees. Thus, it is 
estimated that a 24-inch log 16 feet long would bring $3.60 compared 
to $1.20 for 25 eight-inch logs with the same number of board feet. 
In other words, one 16-foot log 24 inches in diameter has the same 
value as 75 logs the same length and 8 inches in diameter. It may not 
be practical for farmers to grow 24-inch trees but these figures and 
illustrations are evidence enough that the forests should be managed 
so that the harvest trees will be as large as possible and practical. 
As long as conditions are such that trees will make a normal or 
economical growth, they should not be harvested unless financial 
conditions demand it.

Should I sell all my timber now so as to take advantage of present 
high prices of timber? This is one question often asked by farmers. 
They have a tendency to do just that when prices are high. 

According to the chart below, a 10-inch tree is worth 20 cents 
as a sawlog, at a stumpage price of $10.00 per thousand board feet, 
Doyle scale. A farmer, with such trees, may sell now and get 20 
cents or he may leave it and take a chance that prices will be lower 
in the years to come. If he sells, it will take about 30 years to replace 
a 10-inch tree. 

If he leaves the tree 6 years to grow into a 58-cent tree with no 
change in stumpage values, it is worth more money than the 10-inch 
tree now plus another 10-inch tree 30 years from now, assuming 
prices to remain as they are now. Then if prices remain high for 30 
years, he might leave the same tree and it would be worth $3.44; ' 
whereas, two 10-inch trees would only bring 40 cents at the same 
stumpage prices. 

Taking a pessimistic view, however, one might assume that prices 
will drop to the depth of $1.00 per thousand board feet. In this case 
the 10-inch tree, if left to grow 30 more years, would be worth only 
34 cents. On the other hand, if it were cut now, bringing 20 cents 
and another 10-inch tree is grown in its place it would be worth only 
2 cents. So the two 10-inch trees would be worth only 22 cents com- 
pared with 34 cents if the tree is left to grow another 30 years. 

In addition, if the 10-inch tree is left standing 30 years, becom- 
ing 20 inches in diameter, it may be sold for poles or piling which 
bring, as a rule, about a 30 percent higher price than sawlogs. 

Then too, when timber prices drop, prices of other commodities 
are likely to drop in the same proportion. If so, the returns from a 
given size tree may have the same proportionate buying power as 
it has at the present price level.

ESTIMATING AND SELLING TIMBER 

Growing timber or other forest products is a business in the same 
sense as farming, cattle raising, operating a filling station, running 
a store, or any other similar business. Success or failure is measured 
by the amount of income derived from the enterprise over and above 
the cost of operation or production. It is just as important for a 
timberland owner to know the amount of standing timber he has for 
s.ale and its approximate value as it is for the farmer to know the 
number of bales of cotton he has produced and the market price per 
pound at the time he is ready to make a sale. Without this know- 
ledge, it would be impossible to dispose of the crop, whether it be 
timber or agricultural products, at a price that would justify continua- 
tion in business. 

It has been the rule rather than the exception that the majority 
of timber sales, particularly those embracing small acreages, have 
been made without the owner or seller having any conception of the 
quantity or value of timber included in the transaction. The re- 
sults in many instances have been discouraging to the seller and, as 
a consequence, he has permitted his lands to be abused by overcutting, 
uncontrolled forest fires, and indiscriminate grazing. 

In order to obtain the most for his timber, the owner should have 
a reliable estimate and appraisal made either by himself or a compe- 
tent timber cruiser. The Agricultural Extension Service has farm 
foresters assisting farmers in 16 counties with this type of farm 
forestry work. Any group of farmers desiring help on how to esti- 
mate timber, how to harvest timber, how to determine which trees to 
sell and where to sell them, may arrange for a neighborhood or com- 
munity demonstration to be held in the woods on the interested 
farmer's land. The U. S. Forest Service, the Soil Conservation Serv- 
ice, and the Mississippi Forest Service all have foresters helping 
farmers v^th their woodland problems. The farmer can^ arrange 
to get this type of service through his vocational teacher, his county 
agent, area ranger and by writing direct to the extension forester, 
Mississippi State College, State College, Mississippi. Furthermore, 
increased profits may be realized from the timber operation when 
the owner does his own cutting and hauling provided he has suitable 
equipment for this type of work. 

The old time timber cruiser or "land looker" and to a limited 
extent his present day counterpart, has sometimes surrounded himself 
with an air of mystery that has more or less baffled the average per- 
son who is unfamiliar with such terms as board feet, log scale, Doyle 
rule and lumber tally. When the task of timber cruising^ is clearly 
viewed, it is found that basically the determination of timber vol- 
umes is common sense plus simple arithmetic.

ESTIMATING TIMBER 

There are four principal units of measurement which are used 
in estimating and selling timber, namely: 

1. Board foot Represented by a board one foot long, one foot 
wide, and one inch in thickness. 

2. Linear foot. A foot in length without regard to width or 
thickness. 

3. Cord. A pile of wood 4 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 8 feet 
long, containing 128 cubic feet. 

4. Piece. A single unit of any timber of a kind which is sold 
by unit pieces, such as fence posts and railroad ties. Lumber and 
logs are measured in terms of board feet, poles and piling by linear 
feet, fuel wood and pulpwood by cords. 

A log rule is nothing more or less than a table which gives the 
estimated or calculated amount of lumber which can be sawed from 
logs of given lengths and diameters. Numerous log rules have been 
developed over the years and needless to say each gives a different 
calculated quantity of lumber which can be sawed from a log. Scrib- 
ner, Scribner-Decimal C, International, and Doyle are some of the 
more commonly used log rules. The Doyle rule is most frequently 
used by lumbermen in Mississippi in measuring timber and logs 
although some sellers insist on the International rule. The Doyle 
rule favors the buyer in small size timber for the logs will actually 
saw out more lumber than the rule gives while the International 
rule gives a very close approximation to the amount of lumber that 
can be cut from a log. However, with a full understanding of the 
comparative values for each rule it really makes very little difference 
which rule is used. In practice the contents of logs are measured 
with a scale stick which is graduated in inches on the edge and shows 
for logs of different diameters and lengths the corresponding contents 
in board feet according to a given log rule. If a sale of logs is based 
on the Doyle rule, a scale stick with the Doyle rules values thereon 
must be used. The diameters of the logs are measured at the small end 
and inside the bark, although in some localities it is customary 
to include the measurement of one bark when scaling by the Doyle 
rule. The Doyle rule and the International rule are given in the 
tables that follow.

A volume table shows, for a given species, the average contents 
of trees of given sizes in a specific unit of volume. 

Estimating the volume of a tree comprises the measurement of 
the diameter of the tree to the nearest even inch at a point 4^/2 
feet above the ground and estimating the total height of the tree or the 
number of merchantable 16-foot logs it contains, depending upon 
whether the volume table to be used in computing volumes is based 
on total height or the number of logs in the tree. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI

There are numerous instruments that have been designed for use 
in timber estimating. For instance, a pair of tree calipers or a 
diameter tape may be used to measure diameters and a hypsometer 
or an Abney Level to measure heights. Recently a "cruiser's stick" 
has found considerable favor among estimators. This stick may be 
used to measure diameters as well as heights by following a few 
simple instructions. Most county agents, the extension forester, vo- 
cational agriculture teachers or the state forester have "cruiser's 
sticks" which may be secured on temporary loan or purchased for 
about fifty cents. After the tree measurements have been made, the 
board contents of the tree may be obtained from the volume table by 
reading the volumes corresponding to the individual tree measure- 
ments. 

The following tables give tree volumes for second-growth South- 
ern pine and have general application for most sections of Mississippi. 
One table is based on the Doyle rule and the other the International 
rule. (As pointed out previously, the Doyle rule gives values some- 
what lower than the International for trees up to 30 inches d.bh., 
above 30 inches the Doyle gives the greater scale.) These tables 
should be used only for pine and if oak, gum or some other species 
is to be cruised, volume tables for these species should be secured 
by writing to the state forester, extension forester, or by contacting 
local county agent or teacher of vocational agriculture.

Example: A tree 15 inches in diameter at breast height has a diameter inside 
bark of 12 inches at height of 16 feet: 12 X 100 = 4/5 x 100 or 80. Therefore the 
form class is 80. 15 

Timber with a form class higher than 80 will have slightly more 
volume than shown in volume tables above and timber with a lower 
form class will have less volume than shown in these tables. 

Cubic foot estimates of standing trees for f uelwood or pulpwood 
may be made by applying the individual tree measurements to the 
following volume table : 

(Top utilization, i. e., merchantable length of tree in feet, is as- 
sumed to average 5 inches outside of bark, varying from 3.8 inches 
to 6 inches.)

The units of "linear feet" or "pieces" in standing trees are de- 
termined by actually counting the linear feet or the pieces that can 
be cut from the individual tree. It usually requires more training 
and skill to properly estimate the quantity of such specialized pro- 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



91 



ducts than it does to estimate board foot or cubic foot contents. 
However, the owner should attempt to acquaint himself with market 
conditions for specialized products as they frequently bring a premium 
over and above that which could be obtained if all the trees are cut 
into sawlogs. 

To estimate the amount of board feet or number of specialized 
products which can be cut from a woodland tract of small area, it is 
desirable to make an estimate of each tree. Totals for each species 
should be obtained since there are ordinarily considerable variations 
in prices for the various kinds of timber. 

There are several ways of estimating standing timber. Some 
of these require special equipment and technical training neither of 
which may be practical for the average farmer to have. The "cir- 
cular plot cruise" or the "strip cruise" is entirely practical for the 
average farmer to use. A detailed discussion and instructions for 
making estimates by these two methods are given below : 



2 CHAINS 




FIGURE 34 — Diagram of circular plot cruise. (40-acre plot). 



92 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



Circular plot cruise. Following the drawing above, directions 
are given at this point for estimating 40 acres of timber by the cir- 
cular plot cruise: 

1. Begin at the northwest corner of the plot, measure 5 chains 
east which is the beginning point of the cruise. 

2. Measure 2 chains south and at this point draw a circle with 
a 52.7 foot radius and estimate timber within this circle. 

3. Continue 4 chains south and repeat the estimate. 

4. Continue this process until 5 circular plots of timber are 
estimated. The first and last plots will be 2 chains from the 40 line 
and the remainder will be 4 chains apart. 

5. When the number 5 plot is estimated (which will be 2 chains 
from the S-40 line), go east 10 chains, and make another circular plot 
estimate. 

6. Then go north 4 chains at a time, and make similar counts 
until 5 counts are made, the number 5 being 2 chains from the N-40 
line and 5 chains from the E-40 line. 

This will give a 5 percent cruise, therefore, to estimate the total 
timber on the entire plot, multiply the sum total of the 10 plots esti- 
mated by 20. 

The number of board feet in these plots of course may be esti- 
mated by the use of tables on pages 87-89 and with certain types of in- 
struments if a person desires to use instruments. 

Strip cruise. In making the strip cruise the drawing and direc- 
tions below may be followed : 

1. Go to a point 5 chains east of the northwest corner of the 
plot and measure a strip 1 chain or 66 feet wide all the way across 
the 40-acre plot or whatever the size of the plot may be. 

2. Then measure 10 chains east (which will be 5 chains from 
the east side) and measure another strip 66 feet or one chain wide 
all the way across the plot. 

3. Tally all merchantable trees on each strip as the strips are 

run. 

4. Since this is a 10 percent cruise, multiply the sum total of 
board feet obtained from the volume table in the strips by 10 to get 
a total estimate of board feet on the entire area. 

The directions above were given beginning at the northwest 
corner, however, one can begin from any corner in the plot and make 
a similar cruise; in fact, where the strip cruise is made, the strips 
should run at right angles to streams or rivers in order to get a fair 
estimate of the different kinds of timber. This is true because if 
part of the land is on the hills and part of it in the bottoms, there 
are usually different types of timber growing on these elevations. 
Thus, if the strips ran parallel to the streams the estimate might 
show all hardwood or all pine timber depending on whether the strips 
were in the bottoms or on the hills. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



93 




FIGURE 35 — Diagram of strip plot cruise. (40-acre plot). 



The circular plot method described above gave a 5 percent esti- 
mate. The strip method gave a 10 percent estimate. By changing 
the number of cruise lines which are run across a fourth, or by 
changing the size of plot or width of strip, the percent estimated by 
either method could be varied. Any partial estimate is, of course, 
subject to some error, because the sample taken may not happen to 
represent truly average conditions. This is particularly true of 
small woodlots which contain a variety of kinds and sizes of timber. 
In spite of the possibility of error in such mechanical sampling, the 
ordinary landowner will do better to stick to one of these methods 
rather than to attempt to pick out, by using his own judgment, a 
sample acre or two representative of the whole tract. Even ex- 
perienced timber cruisers have difficulty in doing this. For small 
woodlots of considerable value, that is, those containing a large 
proportion of good sawlogs, poles, or piling, it may well be worth the 



94 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



owner's while to make a 100 percent estimate, actually tallying 
every tree. 

Trees to be harvested selectively should be double marked for 
cutting at the time the measurements are made. The marking may 
be indicated by an axe blaze, brand, or paint spot (the hitter is pre- 
ferred) at a point below stump height and at breast height. The 
top mark indicating the tree is to be cut and the lower spot serves 
as a check on the cutters. This method will permit the sellers to 
offer only the marked trees for sale. Furthermore, the owner will 
be able to reserve desirable trees for future cutting and for seed tree 
purposes and at the same time have a reliable means of checking the 
cutting operations against the terms of the sale contract. 



SELLING TIMBER 

The price received for standing timber is primarily dependent 
upon the quality of the timber, distance from markets, and the diffi- 
culties of logging. In planning a timber sale a thorough investiga- 
tion of available markets should be made with the view of contacting 
operators qualified to utilize the timber to the best advantage. It 
is a good policy to get as many different buyers as possible including 
those out of the area where the timber is located, to bid on the timber. 

The sale of timber should always be covered by a written agree- 
ment or contract signed by the owner and the purchaser with signa- 
tures witnessed and notarized. A properly executed contract will 
eliminate misunderstandings and provide protection to the buyer as 
well as the seller. A timber sale contract should give the location 
of the timber by legal subdivision, method of cutting, schedule of 
payments, period allowed for cutting, and the responsibility of the 
buyer for protection against fire or other unnecessary damage.

UTILIZATION OF TIMBER ON THE FARM 

A good percentage of farm timber is used and possibly more 
should be used on the farms and locally for (1) the construction and 
repair of farm buildings, (2) fuel wood, and (3) production of char- 
coal and other miscellaneous products. Maximum use of farm 
timber for these uses should make for: (1) better living conditions, 
(2) use of available farm labor, and (3) use of otherwise, in many 
cases, cull trees. Each of the above named uses for farm timber 
is discussed separately below. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI

FUEL WOOD 

The big increase in the demand for coal required by industry 
and the heavy load that the transportation systems are bearing have 
turned more attention to wood for fuel. 

Several classes of material make up the potential supply of fuel 
wood. Because of the widespread practice of leaving poor trees 
uncut, there has accumulated in Mississippi forests a vast number 
of culls unfit for sawlog use either now or later. On an average, an 
acre of Mississippi forest land bears at least a cord of cull material 
good only for fuel. 

In logging and in milling forest products, a large volume of 
wood is cast aside in such forms as tops, limbs, slabs, edging, and 
ends. Some of this waste from milling operations is already being 
utilized for fuel, or sold as by-products. Little of the waste in the 
forest, however, is now recovered. A great deal of this wood could 
and should be utilized for fuel and will reduce forest-fire hazards. 

Not all jf our timber crop reaches maturity. Each year in the 
United States more than 2 billion cubic feet of timber is killed by 
such destructive agencies as fire, insects, and disease. A high 
proportion of these trees would make excellent fuel wood if used" 
before decay advanced very far. 

As pointed out earlier in this bulletin another excellent way to 
obtain fuel wood is to weed the undesirable trees from the woodlands 
and thin out the over dense stands. Inferior species and suppressed 
trees are often entirely satisfactory as fuel. 

According to the 1940 Census the average size of farms in 
Mississippi was 65.8 acres. It is estimated that 10 million acres 
are in farm woodlands, and as is estimated and pointed out elsewhere 
in this bulletin. An average of about 34 of the 65.8 acres per farm is 
in forests and there were 291,092 farms in Mississippi the same year. 
If every farmer would cut all of his fuel wood from these trees that 
are unmerchantable or those that are crowding or shading small 
trees, cutting those that are doing the worst damage first and con- 
tinue this process, they could probably make all the improvement 
and liberation cuttings necessary and bring their timber into good 
growing conditions in this way in less than 10 years. The average 
farmer probably uses more than 10 cords of fuel wood annually. 
Therefore, it would not take long to cut out the undesirable wolf 
trees and those that are suppressing growth of the good clean growing 
stock on 34 acres of land if all the fuel wood was secured from this 
type timber. 

Production of fuel wood can therefore be made to yield twofold 
returns in connection with good forestry practices such as making 
improvement cuttings, thinning and salvaging dead and down trees 
promptly. Properly carried out, these operations would do more 
to conserve the values in Mississippi forests, as a whole, than 
any other measure except fire protection. Similarly, the use of mill 
waste as fuel not only increases opportunities for immediate profit 
but tends to conserve natural resources. 



96 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



Comparison of heating value of different woods. Moisture in 
the wood is the most important factor in the heating value. When 
wood is burned, the water in it must be raised to the boiling point, 
converted into steam, and finally superheated to the temperature 
of the flue gases. Hence the heat required to drive off the moisture 
does not serve to warm the stove or furnace. Generally from 25 to 
45 percent of the weight of green wood is water, and in such species 
as Cottonwood and willow it may even be 55 to 60 percent. By drying 
out much of this water, the heating value of the wood is considerably 
increased. For example, green shagbark hickory weighs about 800 
pounds more per cord than air-dried wood of the same species, the 
difference representing mostly water. Table 21 below shows that 
this extra moisture reduces the heat value about one-sixth. This 
table also shows the comparison of the available heat in various woods, 
both green and air-dried as well as tons of coal required to equal one 
cord of each kind of wood.

FARM BUILDINGS 

Many farmers with timber on their land suitable for sawing into 
lumber have overlooked the opportunity to construct good farm 
buildings. Some, who have been cutting and selling timber for years, 
have not learned to utilize their forest products and labor resources 
for the improvement of their own farm buildings. Others have not 
been able to finance the structures necessary for the successful 
operation of their farms. When materials and labor must be pur-

chased, and the cash income from the farm is low and hardly takes 
care of family needs, there is little prospect of making extensive 
repairs or erecting new buildings. Consequently, the condition of 
farm structures has steadily deteriorated in Mississippi until many 
of them are in poor condition and some unfit for habitation. A large 
percentage of the farmhouses in Mississippi have poor roofs, 
chimneys, walls, foundations, and should be replaced with new build- 
ings or given major repairs. Many are in fair living condition but 
need some repairs; while others are in good condition, requiring 
only general maintenance. 

In some communities farmers have pointed the way to a practical 
solution of the rural housing problem through a self-help program, 
using native materials, such as timber, stone, sand, and gravel, avail- 
able on the farm or in the locality. 

LUMBER 

Wood is a natural building material in Mississippi. Frequently, 
in cutting timber for sale, farmers reserve a few of their larger, 
straighter trees — often called "board trees" — to meet future lumber 
needs ; hence, the farm woods can rightfully be regarded as insurance 
on farm buildings. Farmers have shown that by using homegrown 
timber, repairs can be made and new buildings constructed without 
resorting to a mortgage or other burdensome indebtedness, and 
without using funds needed for carrying on farming operations. The 
growing of a few large "board trees'' should therefore have a place 
in the management of every farm. 

Mississippi has a number of hardwoods and pines suitable for 
farm construction. Some of the more important woods are given in 
table 22 along with lumber uses, sizes of material, and specifications. 
The term "southern pine" includes several species, such as longleaf, 
slash, loblolly, and shortleaf. It is important to have lumber well 
manufactured and to use air or kiln-dried stock as specified.

LOGS AND POLES 

These products can be employed advantageously in the building 
of dwellings and other farm conveniences where timber is plentiful. 
This method of construction permits utilization of local material 
and labor. 

The principles of log construction are few and simple. However, 
they are not well understood by the general public of today. Some 
suggestions are given below as to selection of trees, logs and species, 
and it is believed that one should have little difficulty in planning 
an attractive home as well as other useful structures. 

Selecting trees for logs. Before starting construction, a 
thorough survey of the w^oodland should be made to determine the 
number, species, and size of trees available, and their sale value. 
Many species of trees have commercial value which warrants their 
being left standing until convenient to market. By following this 
procedure, considerable money might be available later for defraying 
the expense of building, or for other purposes; also, such a survey 
will be of help in determining the design of the proposed structure. 

Suitable species. As a matter of economy one should as far as 
practicable use the trees found on the site. Pine is a very good 
species for building purposes. Short-lived woods like the cottonwood 
and v.iliow, unless very thoroughly protected from dampness, are 
not so suitable. Cedar is excellent but might be valuable if good 
markets are available. Many of the hardwoods are almost as de- 
sirable but are less frequenty used, chiefly on account of their weight 
and hardness. Other species can be used, but it is advisable to 
choose the more durable w^oods and, for the sake of appearance, to 
employ the same species in like parts of the building. 

Size of logs. Logs of from 4 to 10 inches in diameter are usually 
employed, yet larger logs are not uncommon. It is desirable, though 
not essential, that the logs have only a slight taper. The length of 
the logs should preferably be a little greater than a length of a room, 
to allow for intermembering ; tree trunks longer than 20 feet are 
heavy and difficult to handle, they are seldom necessary since the 
length of a room does not often exceed 20 feet. While logs used in 
a wall can be spliced by halving the abutting ends, this is not con- 
sidered good practice as it weakens the wall and detracts from the 
appearance. Short lengths can be utilized for panels between wall 
openings. By careful designing, detail can be worked into a struc- 
ture so as to make use of a large number of short lengths of small 
diameter logs, thus utilizing to advantage a limited supply of timber 
and at the same time effecting a saving in the large trees and in the 
amount of labor required in building.

Use of Logs and Poles in Farm Construction," pp. 1 and 2, Washington, D. C, 
September, 1940.

CHARCOAL 

Charcoal is a valuable product of the forest. It may be produced 
on certain farms at least to provide farm and local needs, or in some 
cases it may be produced on a commercial basis. 

Charcoal should be produced from cull timber, thereby increasing 
the farm woodland income and increasing grov^i:h of the better trees. 

Directions below might be helpful to the average farmer who is 
interested in making charcoal on a small scale. 

By this procedure as little as one cord of wood can be used at a 
burning and only one day is required to burn a cord in kiln. 

Steps in making charcoal: 

1. Cut poles 3 to 8 inches in diameter by 8 feet long, mostly 
6 to 8 inches in diameter. 

2. Lay one of the larger logs flat on the ground. Lay another 
of the larger logs parallel to the first one, leaving an air space be- 
tween them of about three-fourths of the diameter of the log and 
fill said space with kindling, such as grass, leaves, twigs, and small 
limbs. Lay another of the larger logs on each side of the first logs 
and against them on the ground. 

3. Build the pile up by placing pole above pole or log on top 
of log in an oval or half round shape. Lay the smaller poles next to 
the outside and on top — fartherest from the center of starting fire. 

4. Slope the ends up by using short sticks with kindling wood 
between on the bottom to extend the first pile of kindling to out-ends 
of kiln. 

5. Cover with brush, weeds, pine straw, canes, or whatever 
similar materials is handy, to hold up a layer of sod dirt. Then cover 
with the first layer of sod dirt, turned upside down. 

6. Then add another layer of brush and another layer of sod 
until the kiln is well covered, of course, leaving the ends of the 
kindling exposed through holes in the dirt. 

7. Set the kindling afire early next morning or the same morn- 
ing but not later than nine o'clock for pine — perhaps earlier for oak 
and other hardwood, if you do not wish to sit up and watch the kiln 
until it burns down. 

8. When kiln gets to burning good, place brush or a large chunk 
of wood over the kindling hole at one end of kiln and cover with sod 
dirt until no smoke gets out at that place. Then do the same at the 
other end of the kiln. 

9. Allow gray smoke to ooze out all over kiln all of the while 
until the kiln caves in. But if a hole comes in kiln allowing black 
smoke to escape, put a large chunk of wood, if necessary, and more 
dirt until it is stopped. 

10. Six to 8 hours later the kiln should fall in and it will also 
quit smoking. Then about one hour later, tramp all over it thorough- 
ly. Place plenty of dirt at ends and elsewhere, if it is needed, to keep 
out wind or air.

11. Next morning, rake all dirt off and pour in plenty of water 
(if fire starts up, pour in more water). Sack up and use. Kiln 
should be near a creek, pond, lake, or some other source of water.

County, to the Extension Forester, giving Albert Russell's, a local negro farmer,

PART VIII 

FOREST PROTECTION 

PROTECTION FROM AND CONTROL OF FIRES V 
LOSS AND INJURY CAUSED BY WOOD FIRES 

Fire is an enemy of thrifty and profitable woods. The deep 
spongy layer of leaves, twigs, and humus covering the forest floor 
keeps soil cooler than the surrounding soil in summer and warmer 
in winter, conserves the moisture supply for the growing trees and 
for springs, and effectively checks soil erosion. According to the 
Mississippi Forest Service 3,700,000 acres of forest land have burned 
in the State each year for the past 5 years. This is about 22 percent 
of the forest area of Mississippi. These fires cause a tremendous 
loss in timber growth, litter, humus, and many other items, also 
loss in reproduction which keeps the stands constantly understocked. 
Everybody loses when timber burns — the owner, the community, and 
the Nation. The national loss is estimated at $20,000,000 annually. 
The longleaf pine is more resistant to fire than other species. How- 
ever, fire retards diameter and height growth of longleaf seedlings 
about 20 percent. In sapling and pole-size trees, heavy defoliation 
results in one year's growth loss (normal height) being distributed 
over about 3 years, 60, 30, and 10 percent, respectively. 

What fires do to the forest: 

1. Forest fires kill tree seed and seedlings and thus destroy the 
future forest. 

2. Forest fire injures saplings and trees and slows down their 
rate of growth. 

3. Fire scars on tree trunks provide access to organisms to 
decay and insects that seriously injure or kill trees. 

4. Fire destroys the mulch on the forest floor, thereby reduc- 
ing the productivity of the soil. 

5. With fire destroying the soil mulch, less rainfall is absorbed 
and trees are deprived of needed moisture; less water seeps 
down to maintain the flow of springs and streams and more 
of the rainfall flows off the ground surface. 

6. Increased surface run-off of rainfall means soil erosion and 
rapid silting up of stream beds to cause destructive over- 
flows of bottomlands. In other words, unburned forests 
protect soil, springs, wells, and streams, and guard against 
soil erosion and flood damage.

are listed at end of same.

7. Forests provide ideal condition for wildlife. Burning the 
woods drives away useful birds and desirable animals, and 
the eroded material carried into streams, drives the best 
fish away.

Slash and loblolly pine seedlings are especially susceptible to fire, 
killing for the first 3 to 5 years of their life, and even a light burn 
during this period will kill most if not all of the young trees. With 
complete fire exclusion, however, and with simple management 
practices, the growth on sites, average or better, can be maintained 
at 1 to 1 1/4 cords per acre per year ; while without active fire protec- 
tion, natural regeneration is slow and scattered, resulting in under- 
stocked stands with low volume-per-acre increments. With fire 
control and management, 25 to 40 cords per acre can be produced 
in 20 years, as contrasted with the usual 5 to 15 cord yield from un- 
protected, unmanaged stands of the same age.

CAUSES OF WOODS FIRES 

Carelessness is usually the cause of woods fires. Often such 
fires occur when burning is being done to clean up tracts of new or 
old land, or they are set by smokers, who fail to extinguish matches 
and tobacco in cigars, cigarettes, and pipes. A few fires may be set 
maliciously, or, especially in the South, may be set by people who 
still think burning exterminate boll weevils, cattle ticks, and other 
insect enemies. 

PREVENTION OF WOODS FIRES 

Most woods fires on farms can be prevented if the proper at- 
titude toward fire hazards is maintained by the landowner and the 
tenant. Farmers, by their efforts, can generally keep their wood- 
lands from burning. They can stimulate and lead public sentiment 
against the heavy economic loss that occurs when timber burns. 

Some useful precautions are the posting of fire-warning notices, 
maintaining a watchful lookout or patrol over the woodlands during 
dangerous fire periods, and maintaining firebreaks along dangerous 
boundary lines, and interior fire breaks connecting vital streams, 
highv/ays, or roads. Plowed firebreaks serve to stop fire and in 
emergency of a serious fire serve as a base for backfiring — a hazard- 
ous but sometimes advisable action. Another method of preventing 
a fire is by plowing furrows several feet apart and burning the grass, 
etc., between the furrows as shown in the picture below.

REDUCING HRE HAZARDS 



Some of the more important fire hazards, or bad fire conditions 
which make fire likely to farm woodlands, and the protective meas- 
ures that can be taken to reduce the danger of forest fires are the 
following : 



Woodland fire hazards: 

1. Long dry spells when the entire for- 
est area with its litter may be as 
dry as powder. 



2. Large timbered areas unbroken by 
clean roads, creeks, and open fields. 



Heavy slash left on the ground after 
a logging Job. 



4. Stands of dead timber or groups 
of trees killed by fire or insects. 

6. Idle land grown up with weeds, dry 
sedge, and other grasses. 



6. Roadside slash and brush left by 
clearing. 



7. Heavy windfalls and snags. 



Dead weeds, grass, and brush border- 
ing farm building and other fire 
hazards around farm. 



Waisrte materials and open fires 
around town and village dumps that 
border woodlands. 



Protective measures: 

Neighboring farmers and communities 
should keep in constant watch for fires 
and help one another if fire starts. 
Keep out hunters and all others during 
such dry periods. 

Make fire lanes or breaks through and 
around the woods, and remove all 
timber from roads. Prescribed burning 
may be advisable under some condi- 
tions, but as prescribed burning is a 
technical job and dangerous, it should 
not be done without first discussing it 
with the forest fire warden. Every 
care must be taken to prevent excessive 
damage and escape of the fire to the 
lands of others. Talk over fire con- 
ditions with cattle grazers and others 
vv'ho use the woods and ask them to 
help in keeping out fire. 
Lop off limbs, pull heavy tops away 
from standing trees, or when desirable 
burn slash during a damp period under 
direction of a local forester. V^Hien 
harvesting trees, cut low stumps to get 
more timber and to reduce fire danger. 
Remove and use recently killed timber 
and treat the tops and brush as in 3. 
If the land can be used for crops or 
pasture, improve and use it; if it Is 
low-grade land, plant to trees. Seed- 
ling trees can be purchased from the 
State Forestry Department. 
Report to local or State highway of- 
ficials or to the local forest ranger. 
Take care that warning fires do not 
escape. 

Use windfalls if timber has value; 
otherwise clean up fallen trees, scatter 
brush, and burn during a damp period. 
Cut all snags near firebreak or road 
as they may fall across the fire lane 
or cause sparks which may spread the 
fire. 

Clean up such fire hazards around the 
home, barn and other buildings. Keep 
weeds cut, clean up brush and rub- 
bish, and use the grass if possible. 
Sedge or brush burning should be done 
only during damp periods of low fire 
risk and after 5 o'clock in the evening. 
Report such conditions to the town or 
village officials and to local represen- 
tatives of the State Forestry Depart- 
ment. 



106 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



Woodland fire hazards: (continued) 
10. Trash, sawdust piles, abandoned 
buildings, etc., around mill sites. 



11. Waste materials and other trash 
around camp and picnic grounds 
near forest areas. 



Protective measures: (continued) 

If possible, reduce fire danger by clean- 
ing up trash, plow fire lines around 
the mill site, and keep close watch for 
.ires. If mill is operating, warn the 
workers of the danger oi" firer. escap- 
ing into the woods. 

Post fire-prevention and keep-clean 
signs. Visit areas troquently, make fire 
lines, and in bad dry spells, close the 
areas to visitors. 



ORGANIZED ¥/OODS OR FOREST-FIRE PROTECTION 

The State Department of Forestry maintains efficient forest- 
fire organizations whereby they aid woodland owners in fire preven- 
tion and suppression. The protection work is carried on in coopera- 
tion v/ith the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 
under provisions of Section 2 of the Clarke-McNary Forestry Act. 
At the present time, the forest landowner himself pays 2 cents per 
acre (usually with counties as local units, and fire wardens, rangers, 
and towermen are employed.) Thousands of farmers participate in 
these close-knit organizations as volunteer firefighters for forest 
protection at a small cost. The one objective of such cooperative 
mutual aid is to prevent fires, and if they do occur, to stop them as 
quickly as possible. The fire tower is used by the Department of 
Forestry in locating outbreaks of fires. 





FIGURE 40 — One of the fire towers used 
by the State Forestry Department In de- 
tecting forest fires. 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 107 



COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION 

Two types of safeguards have already been set forth: (1) the 
elimination, so far as possible, of needless fire danger; and (2) in- 
dividual or home preparedness for extinguishing fires before they 
reach serious proportions. The third type of safeguard is community 
fire protection. 

To bring out more clearly the relation of the third and final fire 
safeguard, community fire protection, to the other two, let it be 
assumed that in a certain farm community the suggestions already 
given have been adopted and followed in a practical way. In other 
words, let it be assumed that in this community all farmers give 
reasonable attention to the elimination of fire hazards in the con- 
struction and maintenance of their buildings, and exercise reasonable 
care in the selection and handling of equipment and material used 
in connection with household fires, and in the prevention of fire in 
their woodlands ; also that each farm in this community is supplied 
with certain simple fire-fighting equipment which is readily at hand 
in designated places and with which a fire can be promptly reached 
and extinguished before it has attained seriously destructive pro- 
portions. 

In such a farm community the average fire loss will be small. 
Accidental fires will occur only rarely, and of those that do occur, 
a substantial percentage will be extinguished before the loss is serious. 
However, it is reasonably certain that even in such a community some 
fires will occur, and that occasionally one of these fires will not be 
discovered until it is beyond control by means of any ordinary home 
fire-protection equipment. In such cases, an individual needs help 
in putting out the fire, or at least in keeping it from spreading to 
other buildings, property, or woods. 

The need for such organized protection is more pronounced in 
the more typical farm community in which fire prevention and home 
fire-fighting equipment are given only meager attention. 

A rural fire department may not be able in many cases to save 
the building in which fire breaks out, particularly if this building 
happens to be the barn. But in most cases, it will prevent the fire 
from destroying other property on the place and will thereby sub- 
stantially lessen the loss that otherwise would occur. 

FIGHTING WOODS FIRES 

In view of the fact that in spite of all the precautions farmers 
may use, some woods fires will occur and every farmer should have 
certain fire fighting equipment to extinguish such fires as quickly 
as possible. 



108 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT 

The average farmer possesses the necessary equipment to ex- 
tinguish fires, especially in the early stages of woods fires. A 
suggested list of equipment with a discussion of each is shown below: 

1. Portable pump. A 5-gallon tank strapped to the back, with 
a pump operated by hand, is capable of projecting water 25 
to 30 feet. 

2. Stvatters. A common method of direct attack on surface 
fires is to beat them out with swatters. The best swatter 
for the purpose is a broad rubber flap attached to a handle. 
The long-employed pine brush or wet burlap ("crocus") 
sacks can be used as substitutes. 

3. Rakes. It is often unnecessary to wait for a fire to reach 
a firebreak before attacking. It can be stopped by making 
a temporary firebreak nearer the fire. This can be done 
by raking a strip 4 or 5 feet wide to clear away all com- 
bustible matters, such as pine needles and leaves. 

The best tool for this purpose is a rake of the saw-tooth, 
or mowing-blade type, rather than a rake with slender tines. 
This can be made from an old mowing blade. 

4. Hoes. Where there is grass and weeds, the hoe is useful, 
but progress is slower than where rakes are used. 

5. Shovels. Shovels are useful in dealing with ground fires to 
dig trenches and to smother smoldering fires with dirt. 

6. Mattocks and grub hoes. These are especially needed in dig- 
ging trenches to control ground fires where the ground is 
too hard to shovel. 

7. Axes. For removing snags that are likely to burn and spread 
live embers under the force of the wind, and for cutting out 
logs or fallen timber that obstruct the progress of the fire 
truck axes and crosscut saws are important. 

8. Bush hook. A bush hook is often useful in clearing out 
passage ways and in removing palmettos, gallberry and other 
bushes that are capable of burning. 

9. Plow. A temporary firebreak to arrest a 'fire can be quickly 
plowed in the more open areas of the forest. 

10. Drags. A strongly constructed drag, slanted to push debris 
to the side opposite the fire, can be used effectively on fairly 
open, level areas of the forest, but they are not likely to be 
widely adapted because of obstructions they will meet and 
the injury they will do to seedlings. 

11. Barrels and buckets. A constant supply of water is essential. 
Preparation should be made to carry water in barrels by 
truck from the nearest stream and supply it to portable 
pumps by buckets.

MOPPING-UP 

Fire in the forest is not completely subdued until completely 
eradicated. Where there is smoke, there is smoldering fire. One of 
the most dangerous remnants of a fire is in dead tree snags and 
stumps, especially pine snags and stumps which can harbor a smold- 
ering fire for several days only to be fanned into flames and to 
scatter burning embers in a wind to start another fire. This is why 
it is recommended that all dead snags be cut down along firebreaks 
as a fire control measure. 

Fires smolder in the duff or humus accumulated in depres- 
sions or holes in the forest floor. Mopping up these fires is important 
when near a firebreak or the edge of a suppressed fire. This can be 
done with water or with covering of soil. 

The **moppers-up" should patrol the rim of the fire for 12 hours 
or more after the fire has been suppressed to see that smoldering fires 
start no new flames. 

POINTERS IN FIGHTING FIRES 

To prevent and control forest fires in a farming community, 
keep a careful watch for fire or smoke, get to the fire quickly, and 
stop it before it covers much ground. Neighbors can help each other 
by watching for fires in woods not easily seen by the owners. School 
children, timber haulers, rural mail carriers, salesmen, and others 
using the highways, can be of real service to the community when 
they see a fire if they notify the nearest farmer and nearest forest 
ranger. Often times, a fire just getting started can be stopped on 
the spot. Remember that the easiest way to control fire is to dis- 
cover it quickly and extinguish it while it is still small. 



110 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



Other pointers in fighting fires are : 

1. Be alert during all dry spells and fire seasons. 

2. Try to locate the fire accurately, and notify the fire warden 
in your area by telephone. If you have no warden call 
neighbors for help and go immediately to the fire. If the 
fire is on a neighbor's land, notify him immediately and help 
him to extinguish it just the same as you would help him 
extinguish a fire in his house or barn. 

3. Be prepared by having fire fighting equipment listed above. 
A team of mules and a plow may also be helpful in making 
fire lanes. 

4. Size up the fire and plan the attack so as to use your help 
to best advantage in fighting the fire. 

5. When possible fight the fire at its head (place where it is 
burning hardest and fastest). 

A. Pinch off the head of a fire or fight it directly if it is 
not burning too hard. 

B. Beat out fire or make fire lane along sides and rear. 

C. Take advantage of woods roads, trails, firebreaks, etc. 

D. Watch fire lane, snags, roots, etc., closely, to keep the 
fire from breaking over. 

E. Be sure the fire is entirely out before leaving it. 

6. Backfire to bring fire under control. 

A. Use this method only when fire is too large and moving 
too rapidly to fight directly. Carefully plan the back- 
firing and keep it to the smallest possilale area to avoid 
unnesessary damage and to prevent fire from burning 
the property of neighbors. 

B. Use roads, firebreaks, and natural barriers from which 
to backfire. 

C. Make sure the backfiring lane is free of trash and wide 
enough to keep the backfire from crossing it; proceed 
slowly and with caution. 

D. Keep a sharp eye on the backfiring lane so that if the 
fire crosses the land it can be quickly whipped out. 

7. Patrol the fire lanes until all flames and sparks are out. 

8. Try to determine who or what started the fire. 

9. Estimate the acreage covered by the fire and the damage 
done to merchantable timber and young growth. 

10. Report the facts about the fire to your local fire warden.

PROTECTION OF FOREST FROM CATTLE GRAZING 

Grazing Cattle on Longleaf Pine Forests 

The opportunities of cattle grazing in rounding out forestry 
operations have long attracted owners of southern pineland. Some 
land owners graze cattle to consume grass and thus reduce the forest 
fire hazard. Others, especially when open range grazing prevails, 
look with favor upon cattle under fence as an aid to more complete 
control of their own land, affording better production from trespass 
and uncontrolled fires. Still others are interested in making full 
use of all the land resources, including a fair financial return from the 
grass-cattle combination so as to pay land taxes or other maintenance 
costs, particularly on clear-cut land or other areas where there is an 
expensive lag in harvesting merchantable timber. 

In Mississippi there are evidences at present of increased interest 
in livestock grazing; namely, (1) an all-time high in cattle numbers, 
(2) better-quality herds, and (3) more adequate care and feed pro- 
vided. But forest landowners, whether with or without cattle, face 
urgent problems in coordinating cattle grazing with timber produc- 
tion. Some questions asked are: What are the real values and 
limitations of grazing to the forest enterprise? What special pro- 
visions are necessary in handling the cattle and in keeping the herd 
fully productive? These and other considerations are gradually be- 
coming clearer as a result of special studies of forest grazing in the 
South. The Southern Forest Experiment Station, in cooperation 
with the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station, recently com- 
pleted a study,* based on interviews with 118 farmers who graze 
cattle on forest range at some time during the year. The results, 
along with information from experiments in other parts of the South, 
should be of interest, and should help answer some of the questions 
about woods grazing. 

Trees of first importance. Questions invariably arise when cat- 
tle grazing on forest land is mentioned, because trees are the primary 
crop. How about possible grazing damage to trees? What is the 
actual reduction in fire hazard? Does prescribed woods burning 
fit in, and if so, how? The answers to some of these questions are 
clear-cut, but most need further study for a satisfactory solution. 

Damage to pine seedlings. The Louisiana farmers interviewed 
reported that when ranges are moderately stocked, cattle do little 
damage to pine seedlings. They may graze some hardwood seedlings, 
especially during the spring, when buds are tender and growing. 

Grazing reduces forest fire haard. The Louisiana farmers re- 
ported that cattle grazing reduces the fire hazard an average of 27 
percent. Estimates in other parts of the South are higher, averag- 
ing as high as 60 percent. During the spring of 1944 cattle utilized 
over 40 percent of the new green growth of a broomsedge type in one 
pasture on the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana. Furthermore,

Station Bulletin 380, 43 pages, illustrated, June, 1944. 



112 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 432 



close grazing encourages the spread of such low-growing plants as 
carpet grass, Dallis grass, and lespedeza and brings about a cor- 
responding reduction in the growth of large coarse grasses as broom- 
sedges and wire-grass, which form the highly inflammable rough on 
many forest ranges. The invading plants, being better forage, are 
closely cropped and, consequently, present a negligible fire hazard 
in contrast to the usual lightly grazed or ungrazed rough. Thus, on 
grazed ranges, accidental fires usually do much less damage than on 
ungrazed areas. 

^ Burning. Interviews with farmers in North Carolina, Georgia, 
and Louisiana, disclosed almost unanimous opinion that indiscrimi- 
nate fires damage both the trees and the forage. Stockmen who op- 
pose uncontrolled burning feel that it thins the stand of forage, may 
lead to serious erosion, and actually removes plant material needed 
by cattle. 

Some foresters in the longleaf pine belt practice carefully pre- 
scribed burning to reduce the rough and to remove excess fire hazard. 
This fits in very well v/ith grazing management in that type. In a 
cooperative study at Tifton, Georgia, the Appalachian Forest Ex- 
periment Station found that the forage on burned wiregrass range 
made earlier growth, was more nutritious and palatable, yield was 
slightly higher, and cattle made better weight gains than on unburned 
range. Very similar results were reported for the well-known 
McNeil, Mississippi, study. On the other hand, experiments in the 
reed or switch cane forage type in North Carolina indicated that fire 
is not desirable as far as grazing is concerned, since it reduces the 
grazing capacity and shortens the season. 

Prescribed burning is not recommended outside the longleaf 
pine type of forest . 

Many farmers grazing cattle on forest range operate on the 
basis of keeping costs to a minimum in the belief that better feeding 
may not pay off, at the same time recognizing that improved practices 
will increase calf crops and beef production. However, studies in 
the South have indicated definite increases in net operating returns 
per farm in proportion to increases in calf crop. 

Many farmers graze cattle on forest range throughout the year, 
where there is a desirable combination of pine forest for spring and 
summer grazing with bottomland hardwood for winter. However, 
chemical analysis in nearly every state from North Carolina to Texas 
show the native forage to be deficient in certain essential nutrients 
during much of the year. Protein, phosphorus, calcium, and other 
essential minerals are inadequate to maintain even dry cows, and far 
below that needed by cows nursing calves and by growing animals. 
(See Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station Bulletin 27, 1943.) 
Consequently, cattle owners depending on forest range should con- 
sider ways in which their herds can be provided better year-long 
nutrition. An improved season of forest grazing is one way to at- 
tain immediate betterment in cattle production. Depending upon 
the individual set-up, seasonally grazed forest range can be compli- 
mented by other sources of forage such as improved pastures, farm- 
raised forage and feeds, (including both hay and concentrates), 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



113 



winter cover crops, and supplemental feeds. 

As to supplemental feeding, the common practice is to feed cattle 
a concentrate such as cottonseed meal, frequently with hulls, through- 
out the worst winter months, usually from January to March, in- 
clusive, although the average ration now is a subsistence rather than 
an adequate maintenance ration. Based on research already done, 
it appears that minerals and concentrated protein feeds as supple- 
ments to range should go far to attain better forage utilization ; reduce 
death losses ; increase the calf crop, the weight, condition, and market 
value of calves at selling time; and step up the rate of growth and 
development in young animals. Costs would be substantially less 
than the increased returns. 

The use of forest range should thus be fitted into the season 
when it can be grazed most effectively. There are three main types 
of operation: 

(1) Year-long forest range grazing with supplemental feeding 
as needed during the winter to keep herds alive. In- 
dividuals with this type of operation in Louisiana study 
averaged 35 to 40 percent calf crop, calves weighing 250 
to 275 pounds at weaning age, and death losses 5 to 10 
percent. There were outstanding exceptions with much 
higher production, where adequate supplemental feed was 
furnished in winter. 

(2) Long-season forest grazing from spring through summer 
and fall, with grazing on farm pastures or cover crops and 
necessary supplemental feeding during winter. This type 
of operation was more productive as animals usually were 
in at least fair condition year-long. 

(3) Short-season forest range grazing commonly in spring and 
early summer, with cattle on other kinds of forage for 
the balance of the year, i. e., on farm pastures, field after- 
math, cover crops, and adequate supplemental feed in 
winter. This type of operation in the Louisiana study 
averaged 70 to 80 percent calf crops, calves weighing 350 
pounds or more, and with death losses around 2 percent 
or less. 

Grazing on managed forest land. Good forest management 
makes more problems for the grazer. Ample palatable grasses will 
grow on clear-cut or partially restocked land, but profitable grazing 
management under a fully stocked forest is a different matter. This 
is due to the gradual lessening in amount and perhaps quality of 
forage, following shading-out by trees. Farmers interviewed in the 
Louisiana grazing survey estimated an average reduction of 2.5 per- 
cent per year in grazing capacity as the canopy of a fully stocked 
stand closed over. How^ever, there will always be openings in any 
well-managed forest, occurring both naturally and through cuttings. 
Also, wide fire lanes, both of which if seeded to improve pasture 
grasses, can be maintained to furnish a continuous base on which 
to carry the herd.

Cattle Grazing in Loblolly-Shortleaf Pine and Hardivood Forest 

The grazing discussion thus far is applicable only to the south- 
ern or Iqngleaf pine area of Mississippi. Grazing of woodlands in 
the loblolly-shortleaf, hardwood and both bottomland and upland 
hardwood forest types in the rest of the State is an entirely different 
situation. 

GRAZING HARDWOODS 

Studies made at the Purdue Experiment Station, Lafayette, 
Indiana, on effects of grazing in hardwood forests show that the 
exclusion of livestock is the first step in the management of farm- 
woods. Without such protection natural regeneration is impossible 
and a gradual transition through successive stages from woodland 
to pasture takes place. This and other studies show that livestock 
damage the roots in many cases, also the bodies and branches of 
small trees. 

Trampling of the soil decreases water absorption, also makes 
conditions less favorable for reproduction. Overgrazing is believed 
to cause an increase in butt decay. 

Studies on browsing of trees by the Forest Service show that 
the foliage of a number of the more valuable hardwood species is 
particularly palatable to livestock, while less valuable species are less 
palatable. This means that continuous grazing of hardwood timber 
encourages the growth of poorer species while the species of young 
seedlings of the better species disappear and eventually the forest 
is one of poor or less valuable species.

GRAZING LOBLOLLY PINE 

A test was started in October, 1938, on the Crossett Experimental 
Forest in Arkansas to discover what effect modification of the na- 
tural seedbed had upon the germination, initial growth, and survival 
of loblolly pine seedlings on cut-over old-field areas. The experiment 
consisted of six over story (upper crown cover) conditions and three 
seedbed treatments on both grazed and ungrazed plots. (That is, 
36 combinations of factors (6x3x2) were tested.) 

Half of the plots were fenced in to prevent grazing. The un- 
fenced areas were subject to free range grazing, which was some- 
what heavier on the thinned plots than in the adjoining woods, owing 
to a greater abundance of forage in the more open spaces brought 
about by the cuttings. 

Seedbed or surface conditions tested were (1) cultivated soil, 
(2) mineral soil bared by raking away litter, and (3) unaltered soil 
covered with pine straw, hardwood leaves, and occasionally a pine 
top or other logging debris. The cultivated surface was moderately 
rough, no attempt being made to break up clods in the process of 
turning under litter and surface soil. This surface was subjected 



FARM FORESTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



115 



to considerable washing and settling in subsequent rains, which had 
a tendency to cover seeds with soil during the first few weeks after 
sowing. Raking exposed from 75 to 95 percent of the surface min- 
eral soil, leaving the remainder occupied by grasses, shrubs, and 
other firmly fixed vegetation. The cover on the check plots con- 
sisted of litter varying in depth from 0.1 to 1.0 inch, some logging 
debris, and vegetation conditions similar to those on the raked plots. 

Immediately after surface treatment, 170 loblolly seed (30 per- 
cent germinative capacity) were sown broadcast on each plot. Seed- 
lings resulted from this sov/ing were counted and marked in April and 
May, 1939, and this value was used as the total germination count 
In February, 1940, the seedlings were again examined and height 
measurements made of all survivors. 

The results of this test are summarized as follows: 

(1) Little more than half as many loblolly pine seed germi- 
nated on the grazed plots as on the ungrazed plots, how- 
ever, some of the damage might have been caused by 
predators such as birds and mice. Subsequent mortality 
indicates that grazing during the first growing season 
following germination was of little consequence. - 

(2) The influence of over story '/ is not clear, maximum germi- 
nation having occurred under the most dense and the least 
dense lolbolly stands. Stands of intermediate density pro- 
vided neither effective protection nor the best germinating 
conditions. The mortality during the growing season 
would indicate that seedlings under dense overstories found 
it more difficult to survive than those in comparatively 
open situations. 

(3) Loosening mineral soil through cultivation, or exposing the 
surface by raking, materially increased the number of 
germinating seeds. Cultivation increased seedling sur- 
vival over that in either a raked or an untreated seedbed. 
At the end of the first growing season the number of lob- 
lolly seedlings in the cultivated beds was definitely greater 
than that in the raked seedbeds, and the latter in turn 
was greater than the number on undistributed surfaces. 

(4) Cultivation under overstories of either dense or very open 
stands gave the most seedlings during the first year. 

(5) The variable factors studied had no manifest effect on 
height growth in the first growing season. 

(6) The results of this study indicate that in managing a forest 
of loblolly pine during a period of regeneration, reproduce 
tion can be increased by : 

A. Partially exposing the mineral soil before seedfall by 
cultivation or raking, or possibly by logging, or per- 
haps in rare cases by burning. 

B. Not permitting grazing during the winter and spring 
following a seedfall.

DAMAGE FROM GRAZING HOGS IN THE LONGLEAF PINE AREA V 

The damage inflicted upon longleaf pine regeneration by hogs on 
woods range is very great. Hogs root up the seedlings and often 
return to the spot annually to consume those missed earlier until 
in perhaps 3 to 5 years after seed germination, there are few or 
none left. Such damage often exceeds that of fires in certain areas. 

Hogs are attracted to the main taproot. Lateral roots of seed- 
lings are rarely touched. However, large laterals of saplings are 
more attractive to hogs than small roots. Occasionally, hogs dig 
trenches reaching 35 feet to get to the roots. The inner bark is 
especially attractive, more in the spring when other food such as oak 
mast is scarce or when high waters have driven the animals from 
hardwood bottoms and swamps ; and since the surface soil in the piney 
woods is soft, it is easy for seedlings to be readily uprooted. 

Hog damage is usually concentrated near rural settlements and 
on the less w^ell-drained longleaf soils. In such areas, hogs have been 
observed to kill 8,320 two-year-old longleaf pine seedlings per acre 
at rates estimated at from 200 to 400 per day. This rate was doubled 
or tripled over short periods where the stand was readily accessible 
and rooting easy. Thus, one hog might destroy an acre of planted 
pines in one day. In another case, hogs were observed to kill about 
60 percent of a well-stocked stand of longleaf pine in the grass stage 
over a period of several months. In this instance 10 percent of the 
surviving seedlings were damaged. 

An open-range survey on the DeSoto National Forest in Missis- 
sippi revealed that hogs attacked nearly one-third of the longleaf pine 
saplings 2 to 8 inches in diameter but did relatively little damage. 
Greater harm was done to saplings 5 to 15 feet high. Most seriously 
injured were the seedlings between 2 and 48 inches high; among 
these, from 9 to 44 percent were attacked in different districts. 

Consumption of seeds by hogs is usually far less serious than 
injury to seedlings. However, hogs sometimes devour longleaf pine 
seeds almost as soon as they fall, leaving only a few to germinate. A 
study2/ of such damage in unprepared seed spots in southern Mis- 
sissippi disclosed that in 10 nights 1 old sow with 6 pigs removed 
3,454 seeds out of 12,000 available. Of those taken, 61 percent were 
from the burned and 39 percent from the unburned portion of the 
area.

DAMAGE TO LONGLEAF PINE BY GRAZING OF SHEEP AND GOATS^/ 

Sheep and goats, unlike hogs, do not usually damage longleaf 
seedlings until the pointed bud is formed. These animals browse 
and nip buds from the terminal shoot of larger seedlings. Above 
3 or 4 feet the buds are again relatively safe, but occasionally, a sheep 
or goat may bend down saplings to get at their buds. The smaller 
seedlings in the grass stage are likewise relatively safe, the damage 
from trampling being negligible except in long-established bedding 
sites. Indirect harm to the pines, however, results from compaction 
of the soil. 

Sheep may attack longleaf pines at any season of the year if the 
buds are 0.4 inches or more in length. About three-fourths of the 
buds are removed from October to April. Little reduction in height 
results from removal of a single terminal bud from a thrifty pine, 
because during active growth it is promptly replaced by an adven- 
tious bud, which is a bud that appears where it normally would not 
be found. Both natural and substitute terminal buds, however, may 
be broken off repeatedly on areas heavily stocked with sheep^/. 
Many of the broken buds may not be succeeded by dual leaders, and 
crooks in stems grown from side buds are slight. Hence, in time, 
early stem deformity will be completely obliterated. 

Sheep damage to longleaf pine has been studied on the Leaf 
River district of the DeSoto National Forest, Mississippi. One sheep 
to each 12 acres was admitted to a range of 1,300 acres of regenera- 
tion, with all other stock excluded. Within the tract the sheep had 
access to seedlings 2 to 48 inches tall but were excluded from seed- 
lings on small, fenced sample plots. In 2 years, 83 percent of the 
unprotected seedlings were injured by removal of terminal buds. 
Mortality from disease and grazing amounted to 2.3 percent in the 
ungrazed sample plots, and 4.6 percent in the area grazed by sheep. 
Seedlings up to 40 inches high were most affected, the damage being 
greatest in the smaller or medium-size classes. The loss in height 
growth in 2 years averaged about 20 percent; for trees from 10 to 24 
inches tall, it was 40 percent. These tests showed that sheep should 
be excluded from longleaf regeneration areas until the land is 
reasonably well stocked with seedlings 40 inches or more in height. 

A more extensive survey of grazing damage covering 23,640 
acres of longleaf pine open range on the Leaf River district showed 
the following results: Of 3,485 longleaf seedlings examined, the 
proportion multilated by sheep ranged from 4 percent on one grazing 
unit to 92 percent on another, averaging 56 percent. An average of 
47 acres of range was available to each animal. Of the 705 saplings 
5 to 15 feet high on sample areas, 28 percent bore substantial marks 
of earlier injury by sheep. Among 445 dead seedlings (2 to 28 inches 
high), fire and sheep together destroyed 58 percent, hogs 31 percent, 
rust canker 6 percent, brown spot 4 percent, and mechanical agents 
1 percent.

INSECTS AND DISEASES 

Insects and diseases do some damage in Mississippi forests each 
year, however, it has not proven practical to apply control measures 
in very many cases. On the other hand, preventative measures should 
be practiced. Therefore, the discussion below is directed mainly in 
that direction. 

INSECTS V 

Controlling the most important forest insects. A number of 
species of insects attack forest trees. Some of these attack the leaves, 
but the most destructive insects feed on the cambium layer and rear 
their young between the bark and the wood. Most of them normally 
attack dying forest trees and recently felled timber. When present 
in unusually large numbers a few of these species may infest and kill 
healthy trees or those only slightly injured from other causes. 

The only pine-feeding species that can be controlled without 
felling infested trees is the black turpentine beetle. These beetles 
attack pine trees near the ground, each pair making a short burrow 
lengthwise of the trunk under the bark. Eggs are placed in this 
burrow and, after hatching, the young, feeding on the cambium layer, 
enlarge this burrow into a cavity, sometimes extending over several 
square feet. Th^ presence of the insects under the bark is indicated 
by pitch tubes extending outward from openings in the bark. There 
may be one pitch tube for each colony of insects. These insects can 
be removed by cutting the bark around the edges of the cavity with a 
chisel. Spraying the wound with kerosene will kill any that might 
be mature enough to survive outside the cavity. The black turpentine 
beetle seldom if ever kills trees but causes cat faces on them and 
affords means of entrance of more destructive species. 

Two beetles belonging to the genus Ips 2/ and the southern pine 
sawyer normally feed under the bark of dying pine trees and recently 
felled timber. Where pine sawlogs are left too long in the forest or 
the slash is not properly disposed of, a large number of beetles may 
be produced that will attack and kill healthy trees and those only 
slightly injured from other causes. The Ips beetles attack the trunk, 
usually above 10 feet high, and the larger limbs. They make pitch 
tubes at the entrance of their burrows in large limbs. They also 
make pitch tubes at the entrance of their burrows in living trees. 
The burrows of this species also extend lengthwise of the trunk. 
Eggs are placed in niches in the side of these burrows and when 
hatched make burrows at right angles to the burrow made by adults. 
A number of broods may infest a tree and completely girdle and 
kill it. 

The southern pine sawyer also feeds between the bark and the 
wood and under some conditions may attack living trees and kill them 
by destroying all the cambium layer beneath the bark. 

The hardwoods are also subject to attack by a number of species 
of bark-beetles under certain conditions. The two most destructive 
species are the shot-hole borer, which also attacks fruit trees, and

the hickory bark beetle. The shot-hole borers are usually found in 
rather large numbers but seldom kill trees unless they have been 
injured previously from other causes. They usually breed in drying 
branches or recently cut trees, and if dead wood is not kept out of 
forests these beetles may be produced in numbers large enough to 
attack living trees and kill those that are weakest. The hickory bark 
beetle feeds under the bark of dying hickory trees and is capable of 
attacking and killing healthy trees when large numbers of adults 
are present. . 

The only control measures known for insects that feed between 
the bark and the wood of trees is to fell infested trees and utilize the 
usable parts, or remove the bark from them and the stumps, and 
burn the bark and the slash. Pine logs can be floated in water until 
they are used, while hickory and possibly other hardwoods can be 
submerged in water. 

Controlling insects in forests after trees become infested may 
require the sacrifice of valuable timber. If the insects are not con- 
trolled, the loss is still greater. The least expensive control measures 
are those applied to prevent insect damage. The best control can 
be obtained by practices that will reduce to a minimum the numbers 
of insects produced. For this purpose all timber that is cut during 
the summer should be used or treated within a month to prevent in- 
sect breeding, and that cut during the winter should be disposed of 
by March 15. All unusable parts should be burned, including the 
bark of the stump. Logs that will float can be placed in deep water 
and those that do not can be submerged in shallow water until they 
are used. If logs are to be left in the forest for some time the bark 
should be removed. 

The logs may be subject to attack by another class of insects 
called ambrosia beetles, which cause pin holes in lumber. Branches 
with bark on them should be used for fuel during the winter provided 
it is all used by March 15 or placed where any beetles that emerge 
will not be able to infest other timber. 

The sometimes recommended practice of cutting trees in small 
numbers at different times of the year and leaving the tops on the 
ground so that each new brood of insects that emerges will find worth- 
less material ready for attack may prevent serious damage in some 
cases. However, the hazard is there as long as any material capable 
of being infested is left on the ground. The practice of cutting all 
the usable timber on a piece of woodland in the summer and leaving 
the tops on the ground, often results in nearby timber being serious- 
ly injured by beetles. 

There are a few insects that feed on the leaves of forest trees and 
sometimes defoliate them. The young of a species of sawfly some- 
times attacks pine trees and in some cases may defoliate numbers of 
trees. The forest tent caterpillar has attracted much attention in 
southeast Mississippi during recent years by its defoliation of sweet 
gums and some other trees over many thousands of acres. Defoliat- 
ed trees may not be killed but they are injured and may be made more

susceptible to attacks by bark beetles. Where forest trees used for 
ornamental purposes become infested they may be dusted or sprayed 
with poisons. 

The pine tip moth is also occasionally injurious to pine trees 
but under forest conditions it is hardly practical to attempt control. 

Specimens of any insects attacking forest trees should be sent 
to the Entomologist at State College for identification and recom- 
mendations for control. 

DISEASES V 

; Tree diseases take a heavy toll each year from forests and farm 
Woodlands. Much of this loss is preventable if attention is given to 
timber defects and the factors which lead to them. Some diseases 
kill trees outright, but the major loss results from those that cause 
standing timber to rot or otherwise become defective. Trees that 
are rotting faster than they put on new wood will never produce a 
product of value; hence they should be removed from the woodland. 

Trees are susceptible to disease from the seedling stage to ma- 
turity and the grower should be constantly on the alert for "sick" 
trees so that they may be removed or treated. When a "sick" tree 
is found, it is a good practice to send a specimen of the tree to the 
Forestry Department at the State Experiment Station, State Col- 
lege, Mississippi. 

In operating a woodland, it is a good practice to cut out defective 
trees and salvage any salable portion during the regular logging 
operation. Sometimes a defective tree may be considered as "not 
worth cutting," so it is left standing. Such trees take up room and 
furnish inoculum which may infect the adjacent healthy trees. Logs 
should be removed as quickly as possible after they are cut. If cut 
logs are left lying on the woodlot for any appreciable time, wood rots 
and wood stains develop which reduce the value of the logs. In addi- 
tion to the loss from wood rots and stains, there is also considerable 
danger of loss from fire. With careful logging practices and fire 
controls, a woodlot should increase in value each year. 

According to Dr. Paul V. Siggers, Bureau of Plant Industry, 
Saucier, Mississippi, there is only one forest tree disease of economic 
importance in Mississippi in which the control is simple and 
economical to the extent that it might be used by farmers. Dr. 
Siggers says: "This disease is the brown spot needle blight, of 
economic importance in parts of 12 or 13 counties grouped in the 
southeastern corner of Mississippi, i. e., in areas where longleaf pine 
is the major forest type. This disease occurs on the foliage of many 
southern pines but does not, in nature, affect the growth of any 
species of pine, except longleaf and on this host it is serious only in 
the seedling stage."

J. T. Presley, Plant Pathologist, State Plant Board, State College, Mississippi, and

''Prescribed burning," which is where fire is used only for certain 
recognized purposes and on lands where these uses are valid, will 
control the brown spot needle blight. When a ground fire passes 
through a stand of infected longleaf seedlings in winter the mass of 
diseased needles is destroyed. The reduction in amount of the 
disease permits seedlings to retain their needles for the second grow- 
ing season, thus furnishing the stimulus for vigorous growth in 
height." 

Prescribed burning involves the technique of handling fire. 
Therefore, for farmers attempting to use this control measure, it 
might be well to contact their area Forest Ranger and arrange for 
assistance in the application of this measure.

Some Factors Related to Food Preparation 

By DOROTHY DICKINS 

Head, Home Economics Department 



It is the purpose of this report to ex- 
amine some of the factors probably re- 
lated to family food preparation — factors 
such as family composition, schooling, 
and food and nutrition information of 
homemaker, economic status of family, 
family background of homemaker and 
male head, time expenditures in food 
preparation, scheduling of homemaker, 
type of menus served, equipment for 
food preparation, and arrangement of 
this equipment. It is important to learn 
more about these factors and how they 
are related to food preparation, for it 
is on the basis of such information that 
practical suggestions for improving prep- 
aration can be formulated. Better food 
preparation is one way of raising the 
level of living of a family. The food 
supply one has can be made more ade- 
quate by following the methods of prep- 
aration that conserve nutrients. A more 
adequate food supply will result in bet- 
ter health and better health in higher 
levels of living. 

Scope of Study 

This is part of a large study of food 
preparation of small town families of 
Mississippi. It includes 160 of the 
1,158 families in the larger study ,^ 
selected so that there were 16 or more 
families in each of eight groups: white 
families in the Delta and Shortleaf Pine 
Area towns with housing values of $20.00 
and under, and of $20.01 to $40.00; and 
Negro famihes in the Delta and Shortleaf 
Pine Area towns with housing values of 
$7.50 and under, and of $7.51 to $20.00. 
(By housing value is meant monthly rent 
or rental value of house or apartment 
unfurnished in which the family re- 
sides.)-^-/ Families with housing values 
of more than $40.00 were not included 
in this study, since there were too few 
of the 1,158 families to secure a large 
enough record sample. 



Data were obtained in the summer of 
1943 from records kept by homemakers 
and from schedules filled out by means 
of personal interviews with these women. 
White and Negro home economists su- 
pervised record keeping and secured oth- 
er information by interviewing the home- 
maker.-^ 

The homemakers were asked to keep 
a record of methods used in preparing 
12 foods served in the home during one 
week. (See Appendix for record forms 
used.) The foods for which the records 
were kept were limited to: (1) cooked 
vegetables, (2) meat, fish, poultry, or 
(^) breads, and (4) vegetabk 
salads. The homemaker was asked to 
limit records of any one food, such as 
cornbread, string beans, to 3, unless va- 
riety of foods served in this period was 
so limited that more than 3 records of 
a food must be kept to yield 12 prepara- 
tion records. It was asked that records 
be kept of those foods ordinarily served 
when the food was in season and sug- 
gested that a good distribution would be 
six cooked vegetables, one vegetable salad 
(if served that often), and remaining 
five — breads, eggs, meat, fish, and poul- 
try — as the homemaker preferred. It 
was requested that no changes in meth- 
ods of preparation be made during the 
study. Measuring cups, spoons, and 
scales were furnished. 

Other records kept by the homemaker 
during the week of the study were of her 
own activities during each day, of assis-

tance in homemaking activities,-^ and of 
all foods served during this period. The 
supervisor obtained information from 
families in which records were kept con- 
cerning kind and condition of equipment 
for food preparation and concerning kit- 
chen arrangement. She also secured in- 
formation pertaining to family history of 
homemaker and male head that might 
throw some light on the food prepara- 
tion pattern of the family. Data con- 
cerning family composition, schooling, 
food and nutrition education, and eco- 
nomic status were secured in the initial 
study from which these families were 
selected. 

How Representative Arc the Families 

In the larger study, one or two general 
questions concerning the usual methods 
of preparation and/or serving 12 common 
foods had been obtained from each of the 
families. When the information obtain- 
ed from the larger group and from the 
record keeping group of the same race 
and housing value are compared, some- 
what better practices concerning prepara- 
tion and /or serving were found on the 
part of the record sample than of the 
entire group. This was much more true 
of Negro families than of white families. 
Keeping records, even when one has the 
help of a supervisor, is too difficult for 
women of little schooling and thus co- 
operation of the near-illiterate is definite- 
ly limited. Median school grade com- 
pleted by Negro homemakers in the larg- 
er study was the sixth, by record keeping 
Negro homemakers in this study, the 
eighth. Median grade completed by 
white homemakers in both groups was 
the twelfth. 

Also, it may be that there is more in- 
terest in keeping food preparation rec- 
ords on the part of those who have bet- 
ter practices. The fact that record keep- 
ers with the same schooling as non-rec- 
ord keepers reported, for example, some- 
what greater use of milk and eggs in 
cooking, more enriched flour, less drain- 



ing of canned beans, would indicate that 
record keeping may select those with 
somewhat better practices. 

Records of Food Preparation 

The 160 white and Negro homemakers 
in this study kept records of 1,857 of the 
dishes they served during the record 
week. The average number of prepara- 
tion records kept of the different types 
of food per family (i.e., vegetables, meat 
and eggs, breads, vegetable salads) is giv- 
en in table 1. As will be noted, white 
homemakers kept more records of vege- 
tables and of vegetable salads; Negro 
homemakers more of meat and eggs and 
of breads. Vegetables and vegetable sal- 
ads were more frequently served during 
the record week in homes of white fam- 
ilies; breads in homes of Negro families 
(table a in Appendix). Greater frequ- 
ency of preparation would, therefore, ac- 
count for more records being kept. The 
reason that Negroes kept more records 
of meat and egg dishes, when fewer of 
these dishes were prepared ttian in case 
of whites (table a in Appendix), may 
be that they wanted to cooperate by furn- 
ishing 12 records, yet variety of foods 
prepared was limited. Therefore, they 
had to keep more meat and egg prepara- 
tion records. They preferred doing this 
to turning in a number of records of 
cornbread and biscuit preparation, though 
they were free to do so. 

Preparation records of sliced tomatoes 
served to the family during the record 
week are included under vegetable salads, 
since the number of vegetable salads pre- 
pared in these 160 families during the 
study week was small (table a in Appen- 
dix). Sliced tomatoes are not a vege- 
table salad, but since they were frequent- 
ly used and since their preparation, it 
was thought, would be indicative of the 
way the family would prepare salad, il

was decided to accept records for pre- 
paring sliced tomatoes. 

Table b in the Appendix gives a com- 
plete list of foods for which preparation 
records were kept. Records of prepara- 
tion of Irish potatoes, field peas (com- 
mon name for cowpeas), butter beans 
(common name for small lima beans), 
string beans, corn, and okra were the 
vegetables records most often submitted. 
All these vegetables were in season al 
the time of the study. More families 
kept records of cornbread preparation 
than of biscuit preparation. More Negro 
women submitted records of pork dishes; 
more white women of egg dishes. A 
number of both groups kept records of 
preparation of chicken, usually fried 
chicken. Chicken of frying size was in 
season at the time of the study. 

Poor Preparation Practices 

Poor preparation practices are prac- 
tices that are contrary to recommenda- 



tions of food and nutrition specialists. 
Some homemakers in preparing a par- 
ticular dish followed four or even more 
practices contrary to recommendations of 
specialists, while others observed in every 
detail recommendations of specialists. 
Table 2 gives the average number of poor 
preparation practices by food type for the 
four groups of families. 

As will be noted, there were many 
more poor practices in connection with 
preparation of cooked vegetables than 
with the preparation of meat and eggs, 
with breads, and with vegetable 
salads. This was because vegetables 
contain vitamins very easily destroy- 
ed by poor methods of cooking 
and storage. There has been more re- 
search on losses in cooking vegetables 
than in the case of foods of other types 
and, therefore, more possibility for vege- 
table practices receiving a poor rating.

have the problem of the cooking water 
which is sometimes drained off during 
cooking or after cooking is complete. 

In table 3 are listed kinds of poor prac- 
tices found in the 880 records kept of 
vegetables. Most frequent poor prac- 
tices by white and Negro women were 
starting vegetables in cold water, exces- 
sive cooking, and poor storage between 
cooking and serving. 

The frequency of starting vegetables 
in cold water was probably related in 
part to the kind of vegetables used. Rec- 
ords of preparation of butter beans, field 
peas, Irish potatoes, and corn constituted 
somewhat more than 50 percent of the 
vegetable records. In a previous study it 
was shown that some homemakers had 
been taught by their mothers or some- 
one in the parental homes, preparation 
rules such as: "Put all vegetables except 
leafy vegetables on in cold water." "Start- 
ing beans and peas in cold water makes 
more tender."-^ Evidently, a number of 
homemakers were following preparation 
rules learned from mother. Nutrition- 
ists advise starting vegetables in boiling 
water to reduce cooking time and de- 
stroy oxidases quickly. 

Since time of cooking varies with kind 
of vegetable, with maturity of vegetable, 



with quantity cooked, with size and kind 
of cooking utensil, it was often difficult 
to draw a dividing line between over- 
cooked and properly cooked vegetables. 
Vegetables classified as "excessive cook- 
ing" are those which were without doubt 
cooked too much. In making this classi- 
fication, the time table for boiling vege- 
tables given in "Hows and Whys of 
Cooking," by Halliday and Noble, was 
consulted.-^ 

The practice of allowing a sufficiently 
cooked vegetable to remain in the warm- 
er, in the oven, or on the back of the 
stove until served was regarded as poor 
storage between cooking and serving. 
V egetables were cooked oftentimes in the 
middle of the morning and kept warm 
after cooking until dinner time when 
they were served. This practice was 
classified as poor storage between cook- 
ing and serving. Keeping vegetables 
warm until served was not considered a 
poor practice when total time of cook- 
ing and of keeping warm did not ex- 
ceed time regarded as excessive cooking.

SOME FACTORS RELATED TO FOOD PREPARATION 



9 



The practice of cooking foods in the 
early morning to be served at noon is 
said to have come originally from desire 
to reduce to the minimum heat from 
cooking in the house. In farm homes 
in which most of these homemakers were 
reared, wood was used as fuel and con- 
tinued heat in the kitchen is especially 
enervating in warm weather. 

Fifty-one of the 80 white families and 
one of the 80 Negro families had gas. 
electric, or oil cookstoves. Seventy-one 
percent of the vegetable dishes in white 
families and 68 percent in Negro fam- 
ilies with wood and /or coal cookstoves 
only, were poorly stored from time be- 
tween cooking and serving. Forty-six 
percent of the vegetable dishes, in white 
families with gas, electric, or oil cook- 
stoves, were poorly stored between cook- 
ing and serving. It would thus seem 
that the poor practice is not entirely due 
to absence of an electric, gas, or oil cook- 
stove. It may be that practices have been 
held over from parental homes where 
wood cookstoves were used. Work sched- 
ules as well as methods of preparation 
may be handed down from mother to 
daughter. 

Storage of vegetables indoors, usually 
in the kitchen (not refrigerated) over- 
night before using and /or preparing vege- 
tables for cooking the afternoon or night 
before were classified as poor storage be- 
tween harvesting and cooking. Twenty- 
six percent of the vegetable records kept 
by homemakers in white families of $20.00 
and under housing value, used poor stor- 
age between harvesting or purchasing 
and cook'ng. About 8 percent of the 
vegetable records kept by homemakers in 
the other three groups had this poor prac- 
tice. Homemakers in white families of 
120.00 and under housing value were 
particularly prone to harvest vegetables 
the afternoon of the day before using and 
to prepare them then. Shelling butter 
beans and field peas ahead was fairly 
common. Research studies show that 
beans and peas stored in pods lose less 



vitamin C than if stored shelled. 

An important factor no doubt respon- 
sible for homemakers in white families of 
$20.00 and under housing, shelling peas 
and beans ahead of time more frequently 
than homemakers in other groups was 
that they had more young children. Pre- 
paring vegetables ahead was perhaps one 
means of distributing their work load. 
They spent, during the record week, an 
average of 69 hours in homemaking ac- 
tivities. Total time spent by homemakers 
in the higher housing value white group 
averaged 63 hours, and by Negro home- 
makers in both housing value groups, 60 
hours.-/ Homemakers need a list of food 
activities that can best be done in ad- 
vance. 

There were three general types of sup- 
per meals served by families of this study 
during the study period: (1) left-overs 
from dinner, (2) sandwiches, (3) a meal 
somewhat resembling breakfast. The first 
was the most common. It was more com- 
mon among white families than among 
Negro families. It was more common in 
white families of low housing than of 
high housing value. Vegetables left 
from dinner were usually eaten without 
being reheated. Sometimes these vege- 
tables were stored in safes (a movable 
stand with shelves, closed back and sides, 
and screened doors in front, used for 
keeping provisions from insects), in the 
oven, or in the warmer, in the interval 
between dinner and supper. No relation 
was found in ownership of a refrigerator, 
or in type of refrigerator, and storage 
of vegetables between meals. However, 
all white families, except one, owned eith- 
er an ice or a mechanical refrigerator. 
Only 12 Negro families did not have a 
refrigerator of either kind. These 12 
families kept few vegetables from one 
meal to the next. In fact, some of them 
served no supper meal at all. 

The practice of storing left-over vege-

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 433 



tables on stoves or in safes has no doubt 
been carried over from the time when 
there were no refrigerators. The factor 
responsible for continuation of this prac- 
tice on the part of some is preference for 
vegetables such as those that remain at 
room temperature. The fat hardens on 
refrigerated vegetables and this is un- 
palatable. Then, too, space in refriger- 
ators is often quite limited. Homemak- 
ers need instruction concerning foods 
that can best be left out of the refriger- 
ator. 

As will be noted, the practice of using 
soda in preparation of vegetables was al-. 
most altogether limited to Negro fam- 
ilies (table 3). Recent studies have shown 
that the use of soda is not destructive of 
vitamins when only a small amount is 
used and the vegetable cooked until ten- 
der and no longer, and served soon aft- 
er. However, families in this study using 
soda cooked the vegetable excessively 
and /or allowed it to stand on a stove 
for some time before serving. 

It is interesting here to note that even 
though a number of homemakers used 
poor practices in vegetable preparation, 
most vegetables were eaten and liked by 
family members. All family members 
were reported as having eaten 95 percent 
of the vegetable dishes for which records 
were kept. However, record keeping 
was limited to those vegetable dishes 
ordinarily served when the vegetable was 
in season. 

Poor practices in meat and egg prep- 
aration were in most cases frying meat 
and eggs in smoking grease, or boiling 
rather than s'mmcring eggs. Other poor 
practices included cooking chicken in 
water in which soda had been added in 
order to make tender, soaking young 
chicken in soda water, soaking liver in 
boiling water before cooking to draw out 
the blood. 

Poor practices in bread preparation in- 
cluded, for the most part, using more soda 
than the recommended amount, one-half 
teaspoonful to a cup of sour milk. (This 



amount would vary with acidity of the 
milk and for this reason some of the 
bread records may have been incorrectly 
rated.) Several white homemakers pre- 
pared rolls with yeast, soda and baking 
powder. The use of such a recipe was 
regarded as a poor practice, since no sour 
milk was used to neutralize the soda, 
and since sufficient yeast had been added 
to make rolls light. Use of excess soda 
gives a yellow color and a disagreeable 
flavor. In addition, an alkaline reaction 
favors the destruction of thiamin by heat. 

The most common poor practice in 
connection with preparation of sliced to- 
matoes was slicing sometime before the 
meal and placing on the dining table 
where they would be eaten later. Other 
poor preparation practices in salad prep- 
aration included grinding cabbage for 
slaw; peeling, cutting into small pieces, 
boiling, then draining potatoes for potato 
salad; cutting up fine all vegetables and 
allowing to stand in water before drain- 
ed and made into salad. 

Food Preparation Rated 

Poor practices found in preparation 
records of each homemaker were check- 
ed, totaled, and divided by number of 
food preparation records kept. Families 
were then classified into three groups. 
(1) Good preparation. Less than 1 poor 
practice per dish; (2) Fair preparation^ 
From 1 to 1.5 poor practices per dish; 
(3) Poor preparation. More than 1.5 
poor practices per dish. This classifica- 
tion has two main weaknesses: (1) All 
poor practices are not equally poor; (2) 
Families in which more vegetable rec- 
ords were kept were more likely to have 
a lower preparation rating than other 
families. One might say in answer to 
these two criticisms that very poor prac- 
tices and many poor practices seemed to 
be related and that most families kept 
about the same number of vegetable prep- 
aration records. 

The method of classifying families ac- 
cording to number of poor practices per 
dish prepared for which a record was

kept, will be used in this bulletin. No 
detailed information concerning methods 
of preparing particular dishes or foods 
will be given here. These data will be 
combined with preparation data obtained 
by the schedule method from several 
hundred other families and included in 
another report. 

Twenty-nine percent of the 160 families 
were rated as having good preparation, 
40 percent as fair preparation, and 31 
percent as poor preparation when classi- 
fied by the method described above. 
Family Composition and Food 
Preparation Rating 

As will be noted from table 4, there 
was a tendency for families with pre- 
school and school children to have some- 
what better food preparation ratings. In 
this study, homemakers in families with 
children were younger than homemakers 
in families without children and since 
younger homemakers made higher food 
preparation ratings than older home- 
makers (table 5), families with children 
would be expected to have higher food 
preparation ratings. Younger homemak- 
ers without children were not, as a rule, 



interested in cooperating in this record 
study. 

In a previous study of this series^ a 
tendency on the part of older homemak- 
ers to try fewer new dishes within a stat- 
ed period of time than of younger home- 
makers was found. Nutrition investi- 
gators are making available from day to 
day results of studies on conservation of 
food value in cooking, and hence the 
group who fails to change with new rec- 
ommendations is the group using- more 
poor practices. 

Since smaller families of this study 
were more often families with older 
homemakers, there was a tendency, 
though not marked, for smaller families 
to have lower food preparation ratings 
than larger families. Thirty-six percent 
of the white families of two members 
and 39 percent of four or more members, 
had preparation ratings of good, while 
22 percent of the Negro families of two 
members and 30 percent of four or more

members had preparation ratings of good. 
White famiUes of this study averaged 3.5 
members, Negro families 3.6 members. 
Median size of family (the size halfway 
between the largest and smallest) for 
both whites and Negroes was three mem- 
bers. 

The fact that younger homemakers, 
especially younger Negro homemakers, 
had more schooling than older homemak- 
ers may account, at least in part, for 
differences in food preparation ratings of 
older and younger women. More school- 



ing makes for more understanding of the 
printed word, in which form findings of 
research in food preparation are available. 
Most of .the white homemakers with col- 
lege training, and most of the Negro 
homemakers with 10 grades or more 
schooling, were under 45 years of age.

white and Negro homemakers with vary-

be noted, there were twice as many white 
famihes and five times as many Negro 
famiHes with preparation ratings of good 
in famiHes classified in category of most 
schooHng for homemaker as classified in 
category of least schooling for homemak- 
er. The fact that there were 19 women 
with less than seven grades schooling 
willing to cooperate in this study, was be- 
cause other members of their families 
with more schooling were willing to keep 
the records for them and, also, because 
they had a supervisor to assist them. 

Foods courses, such as are taught in 
departments of home economics of junior 
high schools, senior high schools, colleges, 
and by agricultural extension clubs, give 
up-to-date information on food prepara- 
tion. Unfortunately, classroom and club 
teaching is not always carried back into 
the home. Then, too, this subject mat- 
ter is continually changing. Methods of 
preparation recommended in 1923 or 
1933 cannot be used today. However, if 
food teachers do a good job, their stu- 



dents will be well aware of the chang- 
ing nature of this science of food prepara- 
tion and be ever on the alert for the 
latest developments. 

Families in which there were one or 
more members who had had training in 
home economics were more likely to own 
books, bulletins, pamphlets, and to sub- 
scribe to magazines dealing with food 
in its various aspects. 

In table 7 and figure 2, food prepara- 
tion ratings of families with one or more 
members having studied home economics 
in school, college, or club are compared 
with families with no member having 
had such training. About three-fourths 
of the white families and four-tenths of 
the Negro families had one or more mem- 
bers with some training in home eco- 
nomics — a much higher proportion than 
was the case with families of the larger 
study from which these famiHes were 
drawn. More home economics training 
in families of this record sample may 
have been one factor in their better rec-

Economic Status of Family and 
Food Preparation Rating 

Housing value (monthly rent or rent- 
al value, unfurnished, of house or apart 
ment in which the family resided) was 
used in this study as a basis for classify- 
ing families into economic groups. As 
will be noted from table 8 and figure 3, 
forty-six percent of the white families 
with housing values of $20.00 and under, 
and 18 percent with housing values of 
120.01 to $40.00, had preparation ratings 
of poor. Thirty-three percent of the 
Negroes with housing values of $7.50 
and under, and 24 percent with housing 
values of $7.51 to $20.00, had preparation 
ratings of poor. Members of families re 
siding in houses of less value had com- 
pleted fewer grades in school. The wom 
en and girls in these families had less 
often studied home economics. These 
families had less reading material to as- 
sist ihem in better food preparation. Fa- 



cilities for food preparation were not as 
good as for the group with higher hous- 
ing value. The low socioeconomic status 
family is, therefore, doubly disadvantaged 
as far as food consumed by the family 
is concerned. The food supply it con- 
sumes is less adequate in amounts of the 
various nutrients. The methods of prep- 
aration and /or serving they use are less 
likely to be methods that conserve the 
nutrients. 

Family Background of Homemaker 
and Male Head and Food 
Preparation Rating 

Husbands and wives in families of this 
study were rather homogeneous as far 
as family background was concerned. On 
the family history schedule, the following 
question was asked: "Any other factors 
that might account for methods of food 
preparation used: nationality of homemak- 
er and male head, religion, experience of 
parents or grandparents?" Practically all 
homemakers and male heads in the 16G 
families included were Protestant, native 
white or Negro, reared on a Mississippi

farm. In only 13 families, 10 white and 
3 Negro, had both male head and home- 
maker been reared in town. In only 
three families had both been reared out- 
side the State, and in two of these fam- 
ilies they had been reared in another 
Southern state. 

In nearly 60 percent of the Negro fam- 
ilies, either the homemaker, male head, 
or their parents had been house servants 
in the home of a white family, during 
which period they had eaten in the home 
of this family. Homemakers in 30 of 
the 80 Negro families had, themselves, 
worked and eaten regularly in homes of 



white families. 

As will be noted from table 9, Negro 
homemakers who had eaten regularly in 
homes of white families, less often had 
food preparation records scoring poor 
than did those who had not had this ex- 
perience. However, there were slightly 
more Negro homemakers scoring good 
in food preparation in the group who 
had never eaten regularly in the home of 
a white family. Included in this group 
were Negro women who were especially 
advantaged as far as schooling and eco- 
nomic status were concerned-

homemakers of this study had assisted 
with preparation of food in parental 
homes. Assistance ranged from watch- 
ing the bread or turnip greens to doing all 
the cooking for the parental family. The 
principal reasons given for no preparation 
experience in parental home was a sister 
helping with the cooking, and the home- 
maker being responsible for other house- 
hold or farm tasks, and not being per- 
mitted by the cook to come into the kit- 
chen. There was a rather marked ten- 
dency for families in which the home- 
maker had not had experience in food 
preparation in her parental home to make 
higher preparation ratings. It may be 
that women without previous experience 
in preparation are less tradition bound. 
However, the number of cases of those 
without preparation experience in par- 
ental home was small. Methods used in 
the preparation of vegetables and breads 
were often reported by homemakers as 
those taught them in their parental 
homes. The source of the methods of 
preparation for meats and for vegetable 
salads was less often that of the parental 
home. 

Male heads in 25 of the white families 
and in 18 of the Negro families had as- 



sisted parental families with food prepara- 
tion. One homemaker stated that her 
husband had taught her to cook. 

Time Expenditures in Food Prepara- 
tion and Scheduling of Homemaker 

Most of the dishes for which records 
were kept were prepared by the home- 
maker. Ninety-four percent of the 
breads, 91 percent of the vegetable dishes, 
90 percent of the meat dishes, and 80 per- 
cent of the salads were thus prepared. 

White families in which the minimum 
time was spent in food preparation more 
often made preparation ratings of good 
than did white families in which the 
maximum time was spent in food prep- 
aration (table 10). In the Negro fam- 
ilies, however, there were slightly more 
ratings of good in the group spending 
the maximum time, but more ratings also 
of poor in this group. Homemakers, 
both white and Negro, in families with 
poor preparation ratings spent on the av- 
erage a little more time in food prepara- 
tion than did those in families with good 
ratings. 

There was, however, a closer relation 
ship in the time in which the homemaker 
scheduled food preparation activities and

percent of the white famihcs and 30 per- 
cent of the Negro famiHes rated good, 21 
percent of the white families and 22 per- 
cent of the Negro families rated poor. 
When the interval between beginning 
preparation and serving was more than 
IVz hours, 17 percent of the white fam- 
iHes and 10 percent of the Negro fam- 
ilies rated good, 67 percent of the white 
families and 35 percent of the Negro 
families rated poor. A homemaker may 
put her greens on at 9:00 a. m. and leave 
them cooking while she cleans house and 
does the laundry, or she may clean the 
house and start the laundry before put 
ting on the greens. In either case, hei 
time expenditures in preparation of the 
greens would be the same. The product, 
however, would differ. 

Time scheduling is important in food 
preparation. That there was such a close 
relation in time of starting dinner and 
rating in food preparation was because 
starting dinner early usually meant start- 
ing vegetables early and this meant over- 
cooking or having to keep them warm 
until serving time, or both. Of those 
white families in which all vegetables, for 
which records were kept, were excessively 
cooked and/or stored warm until served, 
the interval between beginning dinner 
preparation and serving dinner of 14 per- 
cent was XVj hours, and of 50 percent, 
more than lYi hours (table 12). Per- 
centages for corresponding groups in 



which 50 percent or fewer vegetables, for 
which records were kept, were excessively 
cooked and/or stored warm until served 
were 50 and 17, respectively. 

Poor cooking practices are no doubt 
tied up in part with time patterns in- 
herited by homemakers from the past. 
There is need for continual study of best 
time for doing various preparation tasks. 
Which foods can be prepared first and 
which reserved for last minute prepara- 
tion.? The answer to these questions 
changes with the developments of re- 
search, new products, and equipment. 
Then, too, other tasks of the homemak- 
er must be considered, for food prepara- 
tion is only one of a number. 

Type of Menu Served and 
Preparation Rating 

From table 13, it would seem that fam- 
ilies serving the least and the most dishes 
during the study week were more likely 
to have poorer methods of preparation 
than those serving a moderate number. 
The group serving 75 or fewer dishes 
during the study week were Negro fam- 
ilies of low economic status. They had 
had little schooling and had been less 
often exposed to modern food preparation 
instruction. Facilities for preparing and 
for serving were limited. 

Dishes served were of three types: (1)

prepared for the meal in which served, 
were considered as prepared dishes Pre- 
pared dishes left from a previous meal 
were classified as left-overs. Milk, butter, 
crackers, bakery rolls, jelly (either home- 
make or purchased) are examnles of 
ready-prepared dishes. These dishes are 
in a form ready for eating with little or 
no expenditure of time in preparation. 

About 11 percent of the dishes served 
by white families serving from 76 to 110 
dishes during the study week were left- 
overs. About the same percentage serv- 
ed by Negro families serving fewer than 
76 dishes and serving from 76 to 110 
dishes during this period were left-overs. 
However, 20 percent of the dishes served 
by white families serving more than 110 
dishes were left-overs. Many families in 
the white group servina: so many dishes 
were following the traditional menu pat- 
tern for supper — left-overs from dinner 
for supper. This meant for supper a repe- 
tition of dinner rather than a simpler 
meal. Homemakers who follow tradition 
al menu patterns may also follow tradi- 
tional methods of preparation. This 
would account for lower preparation rat- 
ings with the greater use of left-overs. 

In table 14, white and Negro families 
in the three preparation rating groups 
are classified according to number of left- 



overs served during the record week. As 
will be noted, families serving the great- 
est number of left-overs more often had 
preparation ratings of poor, while those 
serving the fewest number more often 
had preparation ratings of good or fair. 
Cooked vegetables even when stored cov- 
ered in the refrigerator lose some nutri- 
tive value. Therefore, the practice of 
serving for supper left-over vegetables 
from dinner is not desirable. From a 
nutritional standpoint, a supper with a 
hot dish and fresh salad or fruit, or of 
sandwiches, salad, and fruit, is more de- 
sirable. 

Families serving more prepared and 
ready-prepared dishes, more often had 
food preparation scores of good than 
those serving fewer of these dishes. Those 
serving fewer prepared and ready-prepar- 
ed dishes more often had food prepara- 
tion ratings of poor (table 15). The fact 
that families of higher economic status 
served more prepared and ready-prepar- 
ed dishes would account in part for their 
better preparation ratings (table 8).

owned by Negroes to any extent and, 
therefore, it is not possible to compare 
preparation ratings of groups with and 
without such equipment. Only two of 
the 80 Negro families had kitchen sinks 
with one or more drain boards; only one 
an electric, gas or oil cookstove; only 8 
mechanical refrigerators. 

In table 16, the relation of ownership 
of these three types of equipment by 
white families and their food prepara- 
tion ratings are shown. Families who did 
not own this equipment made more fre- 



quently low food preparation ratings. 
Difference in economic status of the 
groups owning and not owning the 
equipment may account for much of the 
difference in preparation ratings. 

That ownership of an electric, gas, or 
oil cookstove seemed more favorable than 
did ownership of a sink with drains or a 
mechanical refrigerator was, as has been 
previously suggested, because homemak- 
ers with wood and/or coal ranges only, 
often cook dinner in the cool of the morn- 
ing to avoid having continued heat in

the kitchen. (All white families except 
one not having a mechanical refrigerator, 
had an ice refrigerator; only 14 of the 50 
families not having a sink with drains 
had no sink; and the remaining 36 had 
a sink with no drain boards.) They 
keep the dinner warm until noon when it 
is served. This practice is destructive of 
vitamins. Figure 5 shows the prepara- 
tion ratings of white families with and 
without electric, gas or oil cookstoves. 

There seemed to be little relation in 
ownership of common cooking utensils 



and preparation rating (table c in Ap- 
pendix). In other words, families own- 
ing double boilers or equivalent made 
about as good preparation ratings as those 
not owning them. Families owning 
roasting pans made about as good rat- 
ings as those who did not. However, 
families with measuring cups and spoons 
and with paring knives, more frequently 
had good ratings, less, poor ratings.

might affect food preparation, a very 
large kitchen causing extra steps and 
time, a very small kitchen causing crowd- 
ed work facilities, resulting also in loss 
of time. Such situations might encour- 
age homemakers to start meal prepara- 
tion sooner than would be the case with 
a kitchen of moderate size. 

As will be noted from table 17, fam- 
ilies, both white and Negro, with kit- 
chens of 100 square feet and less, made 
lower ratings than did those with larger 
kitchens. Families with moderate sized 
kitchens more often rated fair and less 
often poor than did families with large 
or small kitchens. However, white and 
Negro families of this study with large 
kitchens were more likely to have food 
preparation ratings of good. 

Storage Facilities and Preparation 
Rating 

In table d in the Appendix, white and 
Negro families in the three food prepara- 
tion rating groups are classified by kit- 
chen storage facilities which they have. 
Families with kitchen closets or pantries, 
with built-in kitchen cabinets, with oth- 
er kitchen cabinets such as cabinets with 
compartments for flour, sugar, a rolling 
board, and with cellars or outhouses, had 
better preparation ratings than did those 
without such facilities. This was, at least 



in part, because families with better stor- 
age facilities were also families of bet- 
ter economic status and education. 

One interesting exception to the rule 
"ownership of storage facilities — better 
food preparation" was ownership of a 
kitchen safe, an outmoded piece of kit- 
chen equipment, formerly quite popular 
for storage of cooked foods. Fifty-three 
percent of the white families and 38 per- 
cent of the Negro families with a kit- 
chen safe had poor preparation ratings, 
while 28 percent of the white families and 
25 percent of the Negro families having 
no kitchen safe had poor preparation rat- 
ings. Those with safes rated low be- 
cause they used poor storage. Evidently 
those using better methods of storage had 
disposed of their safes.-^ 

^/Distance from the kitchen to the garden 
was also another factor considered as affecting 
food preparation. If, for instance, the garden 
was far from the kitchen, the homemaker might 
gather or have gathered the vegetables ahead of 
time, storing them inadequately until prepara- 
tion time, whereas, if the garden was near 
the kitchen, she might go out when she was 
ready to prepare the meal, gather the vegetables, 
bring them in, and cook them immediately. 
This may be true of farm families whose gar- 
dens are often far from the house. In these 
town families, distance of the garden did not 
seem important. However, the majority of gar- 
dens were less than 36 feet from the kitchen.

Convenience as well as possession of 
storage facilities and food preparation rat- 
ing are related (table 18). Here, too, 
economic situation is one factor, families 
with dish cabinets near sinks more often 
being families of higher economic status. 

Location of Dining Table With 
Respect to Stove and Serving Unit 
and Food Preparation Rating 

According to Miss Maud Wilson, two 
important connections between working 
surfaces and areas concerned with prepa- 
ration and consumption of food are: (1) 
stove near to dining table; (2) serving 
unit near to dining table.—/ These con- 
nections were investigated in this study 
as it was thought that convenience of 
stove to dining table, and of serving unit 
to dining table, might mean less stand- 
ing around of food, and hence, better 
prepared food. "Near to" was defined 
as connecting or only two or three steps 
between, with no other equipment to be 
walked around. 

Another connection mentioned as im- 



portant by Miss Wilson was nearness of 
refrigerator to serving unit. However, in 
this study there were only 24 families 
(19 white and 5 Negro) with the re- 
frigerator near the serving unit. Most of 
these 24 families were owners of me- 
chanical refrigerators. Ice refrigerators 
are often kept outside the kitchen.^ 

When the stove and dining table were 
near, when the serving unit and dining 
table were near, there were more ratings 
of good food preparation, fewer of poor 
food preparation (tables 19 and 20). As 
will be noted, 50 percent of the white

ii/Other connections studied were location of 
stove with respect to dishwashing unit; location 
of mixing unit with respect to dishwashing unit; 
location of dining table with rtspcct to dish- 
washing unit. Families with these areas con- 
necting or only two or three steps between with 
no other equipment to be walked around had 
no better, and in many cases not as good, prep- 
aration ratings than did those with areas not 
near.

4n 8 white families and 29 Negro families, the serving unit and the dining table were the same 



families and 38 percent of the Negro fam- 
ilies with stove and dining table near 
made preparation ratings of good, while 
27 percent of the white families and 20 
percent of the Negro families in which 
this equipment was not near made prep- 
aration ratings of good (table 19). Forty- 
six percent of the white families and 
31 percent of the Negro families with 
serving unit and dining table near, and 
21 precent of the white families and 18 
percent of the Negro families with this 
equipment not near made preparation 
ratings of good. This suggests that con- 
venience of stove to dining table, of serv- 
ing unit to dining table, may mean bet- 
ter prepared food. Further investigation 
is needed here. 

Nearly 60 percent of the white fam- 
ilies and about 75 percent of the Negro 
families ate entirely or most of the time 
in their kitchens. However, about 70 
percent of the white families had a din- 
ing room or both dining room and break- 
fast room. Forty percent of the Negro 
families had a dining room. Families 
in this study who ate in the kitchen all 
or part of the time made on the whole 
somewhat better preparation ratings than 
families eating in another room. 
Summary and Conclusions 

The purpose of this investigation was 
to study some of the factors probably re- 
lated to food preparation. The factors 
examined were family composition, 
schooling, and food and nutrition in- 
formation of homemaker, economic status 



of family, family background of home- 
maker and male head, time expenditures 
in food preparation, scheduling of home- 
maker, type of menus served, equipment 
for food preparation, and arrangement 
of this equipment. 

One hundred and sixty families were 
included — 80 white families with hous- 
ing value of $20.00 and under and of 
$20.01 to $40.00, and 80 Negro families 
with housing value of $7.50 and under 
and of $7.51 to $20.00. (Housing value 
is defined as monthly rent or rental value, 
unfurnished, of house or rooms in which 
the family resided.) 

Data were obtained in the summer of 
1943 from records kept by homemakers 
and from schedules filled out by means of 
personal interviews with these women. 
White and Negro home economists su- 
pervised record keeping and secured oth- 
er information by interviewing the home- 
maker. 

The 160 white and Negro homemakers 
kept records of 1,857 of the dishes they 
prepared during the record week. The 
dishes for which records were kept were 
limited to vegetables, meat and eggs, 
breads and vegetable salads. Most of the 
dishes for which records were kept were 
prepared by the homemaker — 94 percent 
of the breads, 91 percent of the vegetable 
dishes, 90 percent of the meat dishes, and 
80 percent of the salads. Food prepara- 
tion of each family was rated according 
to average number of poor practices (or 
practices contrary to recommendations of 



SOME FACTORS RELATED TO FOOD PREPARATION

food and/or nutrition specialists) per 
I dish per preparation record kept. Fam- 
ilies were classified into three groups: 

(1) good prcfparation, including those 
with less than one poor practice per dish; 

(2) fair preparation, those with from 1 
to 1.5 poor practices per dish; (3) poor 
preparation, those with more than 1.5 
poor practices per dish. Twenty-nine 
percent of the 160 families rated thus 
had good preparation, 40 percent fair 
preparation, and 31 percent poor prepara- 
tion. 

Families with younger homemakers 
made better preparation ratings. The fact 
that younger homemakers had more 
schooling than older homemakers was in 
part responsible. Schooling of home- 
maker and preparation rating seemed to 
be related. 

Families in which one or more mem- 
bers had studied home economics in 
school, college, or club had somewhat bet- 
ter preparation ratings than those in 
which no member had had this training. 

Families residing in houses of lower 
rent or rental value more frequently made 
preparation ratings of poor than did those 
residing in houses of higher rent or rent- 
al value. Homemakers in the lower hous- 
ing value groups had less schooling. The 
lower housing value families less often 
had members who had studied home eco- 
nomics, less often had reading material 
to assist them in better food preparation, 
had poorer facilities for food preparation. 

Negro homemakers who had eaten 
regularly in homes of white families less 
frequendy had food preparation records 
scoring poor than did those who had not 
had a similar experience. However, 
there were slightly more Negro home- 
makers scoring good in food preparation 
in the group who had never eaten reg 
ularly in the home of a white family. 

Methods used in the preparation of 
vegetables and of breads were often re- 
ported by homemakers as those taught 
them in their parental homes. The 



source of the method of preparation for 
meats and for vegetable salads was less 
often reported by homemakers as that 
taught them in parental home. 

There was a tendency for those fam- 
ilies in which the maximum time was 
spent in food preparation to have more 
often ratings of poor. There was like- 
wise a tendency for families with home- 
makers spending more time in food prep- 
aration to have lower preparation ratings. 

There was, however, a closer relation- 
ship in the time in which the homemak- 
er scheduled food preparation activities 
and food preparation rating than in total 
time she spent in such activities and food 
preparation ratings. When the interval 
between beginning preparation and serv- 
ing dinner was lYz hours or less, 55 per- 
cent of the white families and 30 per- 
cent of the Negro families rated good, 21 
percent of the white families and 22 per- 
cent of the Negro families rated poor. 
When the interval between beginning 
preparation and serving dinner was more 
than 2^/2 hours, 17 percent of the white 
families and 10 percent of the Negro 
families rated good, 67 percent of the 
white families and 35 percent of the 
Negro families rated poor. Starting din- 
ner early often meant starting vegetables 
early and this meant overcooking or hav- 
ing to keep them warm until meal time. 

Families serving the greatest number 
of left-overs at meals during the study 
week more often had preparation ratings 
of poor. The traditional supper meal is 
left-overs from dinner. Homemakers 
who follow traditional menu patterns may 
also follow traditional methods of prep- 
aration. 

Families serving more prepared and 
ready-prepared dishes at meals during the 
study week more often had preparation 
ratings of good; those serving fewer of 
these dishes less often had ratings of 
good. The number of these two types of 
dishes served seems to be related to eco- 
nomic status of the family.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 433 



Families owning food preparation 
equipment such as a sink with one or 
two drains, an electric, gas or oil cook- 
stove, a mechanical refrigerator, had bet- 
ter preparation ratings than those not 
owning such equipment. Ownership of 
an electric, gas or oil cookstove seemed 
favorable for good preparation. This 
was not only because families of high- 
er economic status more often had such 
equipment, but because wood and/or coal 
ranges used in lieu of the others cause 
continued heat in the kitchen. To avoid 
this, many homemakers cook dinner in 
early morning, allowing it to remain on 
the stove until served. This practice is 
destructive of vitamins. 

Families with kitchens of 100 square 
feet or less made lower preparation rat- 
ings than did those with larger kitchens. 
Small kitchens cause crowded work fa- 
cilities and inadequate storage. Families 
with good storage facilities such as kit- 
chen pantries, built-in cabinets, kitchen 
cabinets, had better preparation ratings 
than did those without such facilities. 
Convenience as well as possession of stor- 
age facilities seemed important in food 
preparation. 

When the stove and dining table were 
near, and when the serving unit and din- 
mg table were near, there were more 
ratings of good preparation, fewer of poor 
food preparation. Convenience of this 
equipment may mean less standing around 
of food, and hence, better prepared food 

Preparation ratings are the sum total 
of many factors. No single one can ac- 



count for ratings of "good." In this par- 
ticular investigation there were too few 
families to study the interrelationships of 
all the factors. 

White families seemed a more homo- 
geneous group on the basis of food prep- 
aration rating and education when an- 
alyzed statistically. There is need for 
further study of this problem, f6r it is 
on the basis of such study that effective 
programs to improve practices can be de- 
veloped. 

From this study it would seem thai 
better preparation would result (1) with 
more schooling, especially for homemak- 
ers in low socioeconomic families, since 
better preparation is dependent in part on 
better understanding of the spoken and 
printed word; (2) with home economics 
training for all homemakers; (3) with 
higher incomes for low socioeconomic 
status groups in order that they may ob- 
tain more of the material, and cultural 
equipment that makes better preparation 
more easily obtainable; (4) with clearer 
understanding on the part of home eco- 
nomics educators of the role of tradition 
in food preparation, in menu patterns, in 
time expenditure patterns and the source 
of such traditions; (5) with clearer under- 
standing on the part of home economists 
of activities that go on in homes m order 
that better assistance can be given in time 
scheduling and in the choice, use, and 
arrangement of equipmnet that facilitates 
good preparation. Close coordination be- 
tween management and food and nutri- 
tion is very much needed.

The Vitamin A Potency of 
Creamery Butter Produced 
In Mississippi 



By F. H. HERZER AND MARVIN GIEGER 



MISSISSIPPI STATE COLLEGE 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION 
CLARENCE DORMAN, Director 
STATE COLLEGE MISSISSIPPI 



THE VITAMIN A POTENCY OF CREAMERY BUTTER 
PRODUCED IN MISSISSIPPI 

By F. H. HERZER and MARVIN GIEGER 



The Food and Nutrition Board of the 
National Research Council, in making 
wartime food recommendations, recogniz- 
ed that a seasonal variation in the vitamin 
A potency of milk and butter existed. 
While previous studies have disclosed 
many fundamental facts regarding the 
vitamin A content of butterfat, the act- 
ual variation of this substance in the 
butter offered the consuming public in 
the various sections of the United States 
at different seasons of the year was not 
known. A nation-wide study to learn 
these facts was recommended by the Bu- 
reau of Dairy Industry and the Office of 
Experiment Stations, To date the Ex- 
periment Stations of 19 states have par- 
ticipated in this project. The Mississippi 
Station began its first studies in March 
1943. 

An appraisal of the actual contribution 
which dairy products make to the na 
tional requirements was suggested by 
Palmer and Jenness, who estimated that 
the total vitamin A potency in the milk 
and milk products consumed in the Unit- 
ed States is adequate to supply the vita- 
min A needs of 42,000,000 people. If 
by conserving the carotene in hays and 
silages and developing winter grazing, 
the vitamin A potency of winter milk 
could be increased to that of average 
summer milk, the vitamin A require- 
ments of 11,000,000 more people could 
be satisfied. This would mean that 40 
percent of the total units now considered 
essential in the human diet would be 
contributed by the dairy industry. 

Since the vitamin A potency of milk 
depends upon the carotene content of the 
feeds consumed by the cow, conditions 
which are conducive to fresh growing 
pasture grasses, properly cured hay, and 
preserved silage, will enhance the vita- 
min value of the milk and at the same 
time stimulate production. Unquestion- 



ably, a higher vitamin A potency of milk 
and butter can be secured immediately 
and economically through better pasture 
management and the proper care of cur- 
ed roughages. 

Methods 

Samples of butter were secured from 
three creameries located within a radius 
of 25 miles. These plants make about 
60 percent of the butter manufactured 
in Mississippi. The samples selected by 
these plants represented butter of three 
general types, namely: that made from 
cream separated on the farm and deliver- 
ed sweet to the creamery, designated as 
A; that firom cream separated on the 
farm and held in most instances until 
sour before delivery to the plant, design- 
ated as B; and that from sweet cream 
secured by separating sweet milk at the 
plant, designated as C. 

Much of the cream delivered to cream- 
ery A averaged 0.18 to 0.25 percent aci- 
dity. This cream was heated to 160° F. 
by a steam jet and agitated in a ccM 
pasteurizer for 30 minutes at 155° F. be- 
fore cooling to churning temperature. 
The bulk of this cream was churned 
within 1 or 2 hours after pasteurization. 

The butter used in this project from 
creamery B was made from sour cream 
ranging in acidity from 0.5 to 1 percent, 
much of which originated with smaller 
shippers and cream stations scattered 
throughout the State. This was neutral- 
ized with sodium carbonate and sodium 
bicarbonate to approximately 0.25 percent 
acidity, forewarmed to 90° F. and flash 
pasteurized at 210° F. in a high 
temperature vacuum-type unit. As the 
hot cream sprayed into the vacuum com- 
partment the temperature dropped to 
140° F. This cream was immediately 
cooled to churning temperature over a 
surface cooler, held from 1 to 2 hours, 
and churned. -^f-^: ^v'

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 434 



The cream used by creamery C was 
secured by separating fresh milk deliver, 
cd to the plant. This cream had a very 
low acidity of 0.10 percent to 0.12 per- 
cent and was heated to 155° F. in a 
coil vat, pasteurized and held for 30 min- 
lites before being cooled to churniaig 
temperature in the vat. 

One pound samples of butter were 
secured from these creameries the first of 
each month. Analyses for carotene, vi- 
tamin A, and composition, (moisture, 
salt, curd, and butterfat) were made im- 
mediately. The butter was held in a 
45° to 50° F. refrigerator to simulate stor- 
age conditions in the retail store and 
home refrigerator. At the end of 15 
days and 30 days storage the same an- 
alyses were made. Since much of the 
butter produced in April, May, and June 
goes into cold storage, additional one- 
pound samples were stored at 0° F. for 5 
months. This butter was then placed in 
a 45° F. storage, analyzed immediately 
and after storage for 15 days and after 
30 days, to learn what effect, if any, 
storage and marketing routine might 
have on the vitamin A content. 

Analytical Methods 

The antimony trichloride method of 
determining vitamin A was used, the 
procedure being that of Koehn and Sher- 
man.* Crystalline vitamin A alcohol 
(Distillation Products, Inc., 755 Ridge 
Road West, Rochester, New York) was 
used for vitamin A, Standard. 

EXPERIMENTAL 
Effect of Season 

Approximately twice as much butter 
was made during the months of May, 
June, July, and August as in December, 
January, February, and March. This is 
shown in table 1 which lists the percent- 
age of years' production of creamery but- 
ter manufactured each month during the 

1 Koehn, C. J. and Sherman, W. C. The De- 
termination of Vitamin A and Carotene with a 
Photoelectric Colorimeter. Jour. Biol. Chem., 132: 
527-538. 1940. 



year period from 1940 to 1944. 

A statistical study of the analyses show- 
ed that there was no significant change 
in carotene and vitamin A content of the 
butter during the 15- and 30-day holding 
periods. All analyses of the nine sam- 
ples of butter examined each month were 
therefore averaged in establishing the sea- 
sonal trend. The monthly variation in 
International Units of vitamin A per 
pound of butter throughout the year is 
shown in table 2 and graphically present- 
ed in figure 1. 

A high level of vitamin A potency con- 
tinued through July, August, September, 
and October 1943 and was resumed dur- 
ing April, May, and June of 1944. Dur- 
ing these months the samples of butter 
averaged 18,230 International Units per 
pound. Since these values are probably 
representative of the entire State's make, 
approximately 70 percent of the annual 
butter production would be expected to 
contain a relatively high vitamin A pot- 
ency. 

The lack of feed of high carotene con- 
tent such as properly preserved silage, 
high grade hay, fall and winter cover 
crops, is reflected in the lower levels 
reached during November, December. 
January, February, and March. During 
these months the total vitamin A potency 
averaged slightly over 12,000 Interna- 
tional Units, the lowest level of 10,128 
Units being reached in February. 

With the appearance of pasture grasses 
and clovers some increase in vitamin A 
content is shown on March 1st, however, 
the effect of a plentiful supply of green 
feed is shown by the increase to 18,860 
International Units on April 1st. 

The carotene content of the butter 
reached both higher and lower levels 
than the vitamin A, ranging from 1.55 
in March to 7.86 micrograms per gram 
of butter in August. The vitamin A con- 
tent remained between the rather nar- 
row limits of 4.42 on February 1st and 
7.5 micrograms per gram of butter on

April 1st. The vitamin A recovered from 
its downward trend March 1st, one 
month earlier than the carotene. How- 
ever the carotene increased from 1.55 on 
March 1st to 5.6 on April 1st, which 
was the greatest spread between any two 
months of either material. During the 
months of low carotene intake, namely 
November, December, January, Febru- 
ary, and March, approximately 20 percent 
of the total vitamin A potency was furn- 
ished, by carotene, while during the re- 
mainder of the year 30 percent was sup- 
plied by carotene. 



Effect of Short Storage 

The values in table 3 are based on 
the average carotene and vitamin A con- 
tent of the butter from the three cream- 
eries for the first, fifteenth, and thirtieth 
of each month. This butter was held 
in a 45° to 50° F. refrigerator in quarter- 
pound prints, and storage corresponded 
to retail store and home refrigerator con- 
ditions. The data presented indicate that 
both carotene and vitamin A were very 
stable.

and vitamin A due to 15- and 30-day

(igurc 2. Seasonal variation of carotene and viumin A in butter from three Mississippi 
creameries. 



Storage was not significant. F values for 
the 15- and 30-day storage periods were 
1.00 for vitamin A and 0.51 for caro- 
tene. To be statistically significant at 
odds of 20 to 1, the F value for either 
carotene or vitamin A would need to 
exceed 3.11. On numerous sequences the 
15- or 30-day storage samples were high- 
er in carotene or vitamin A than fresh 
butter. These disturbing results have 
been reported by other Stations and a\ 
this time are not exDlainable. 

No trends were established which in- 
dicated any deterioration in the vitamin 
potency due to holding for one month at 
45° to 50° F. 



Effect of Long Storage 

Much butter goes into cold storage dur- 
mg the season of greatest production. 
This butter is generally held at 0° to -10° 
F. for 3 to 6 months and is then brought 
out during seasonal shortage, whereupon 
it follows the ordinary marketing chan- 
nels at relatively high temperatures. Ad- 
ditional samples of butter were secured 
durmg April, May, and June from the 
same churnings used in the original tests. 
These samples were held in a 0° to -10* 
F. storage room for 5 months, then re- 
moved and placed in a 45° F. refrigerator. 
This butter was analyzed on the 1st, 15th, 
and 30th day after removal from the low

temperature room, and the data are pre- 
sented in table 4. 

From the data obtained, no trend in- 
dicating that the carotene or vitamin A 
decreased due to storage at 0° F. or dur- 
ing the succeeding 30-day holding period 
at 45° F. was established. ^ 

The average values secured for the 
carotene and vitamin A after 5 months 
storage were actually higher than the or- 
iginal samples. While there were a few 
tests which might be questioned, most 
determinations were within the range of 
experimental error and indicate that the 
carotene and vitamin A were not adverse- 
ly affected by 5 months storage at 0° F. 

Effect of Holding Cream 

Of interest was the somewhat lower 
potency of the butter from creamery B, 
the source of the sour cream butter. Al- 
though the three creameries in the study 
were located in the same immediate ter- 
ritory, a study of the data showed a 
significantly lower carotene and vitamin 
A content in the butter from this one 
plant. 

While the higher acidity in the cream 
used in making the samples of butter se- 
cured from creamery B might be expect- 
ed to minimize any reduction in vitamin 
A potency, a series of tests was conduct- 
ed to learn if holding cream at fairly 
high temperatures with accompanying 
high acid, yeast and mold development, 
and partial neutralization, uiight fhave 
some influence. 



Five tests were completed wherein 
fresh cream was collected directly from 
the separator, divided into five lots, and 
made into butter after different holding 
periods. Lot 1 was churned immediately 
without pasteurizing. Lot 2 was pas- 
teurized at 155° F. for 30 minutes, cool- 
ed and churned. The remaining lots 
\^'e^e held at room temperatures, neutral- 
ized, pasteurized and churned at 3-day 
intervals. 

Some of the samples held at 80° to 90' 
F. developed a very high acidity (1 per- 
cent to 1.9 percent) and a yeasty moldy 
condition. Although the butter was not 
held for a prolonged storage period, 
much of the butter made from sour 
:ream partially neutralized was actually 
in storage for several weeks before be- 
ing analyzed. An examination of table 
6 shows that while there was the same 
fluctuation in the carotene and vitamin 
A content experienced in some of the 
Dther tests, no significant reduction in 
vitamin A potency was recorded in the 
iour cream butter. Since feed and pas- 
ture conditions are quite similar in the 
territory immediately surrounding these 
plants, the fact that creamery B receiv- 
sd cream from direct shippers and cream 
stations located in various parts of the 
State possibly not so favored with satis- 
factory pasture, offers the most logical 
cfxplanation. The most noticeable spread 
between the three butters, occurs in the 
fall and winter months, when many small 
Jairymen make little effort to supply a 
high quality roughage for their cows.

hen heated to 90° F. before entering the

a steam jet which heated it to 200° to 
215° F, then quickly sprayed into a 
v'acuum pan where the temperature drop- 
ped to approximately 140° F. This cream 
chen passed over a surface cooler and 
A^as cooled to churning temperature. Four

taken from the forewarmer before treat- 
ment and again off the cooler after be- 
ing completely processed. The samples 
of cream were churned and the butter 
inalyzed. The results of this brief study 
recorded in table 7 indicate that this

Summary 

1. The butter analysed in this study 
ontained approximately 18,000 Inter- 
national Units of vitamin A per pound 
from April to October inclusive. The 
butter exam ned from November through 
March contained an average of approxi- 
mately 12,000 International Units per 
j ound. 

The similarity of the vitamin A con- 
tent of butter produced in Mississippi to 
the national average as determined from 
results secured by the 19 participating 
states is most striking. The U. S. De- 
partment of Agriculture Miscellaneous 
Publication No. 571, "Vitamin A in But- 
ter," records that the summer butter av- 
eraged 18,000 International Units of vit- 
amin A per pound while winter butter 
contained approximately 11,200 units per 
pound. 

2. Approximately seventy percent of 
(he butter made in Mississippi is produc- 
crci during the months of high vitamin A 
i^otency. 

3. Holding the butter at 45° F. for 
one month did not lower the carotene 
or vitamin A content. 



4. Holding the butter at 0° F. for 
5 months followed by 30 days storage 
at 45° F. did not lower the carotene or 
vitamin A content. 

5. The development of varying aci- 
dities in cream and subsequent neutral- 
ization before pasteurization did not low 
er the carotene or vitamin A content. 

6. The use of high temperature vacu- 
um type of pasteurization did not affect 
the carotene or vitamin A content. 

7. The carotene content of the butter 
examined showed a much greater sea- 
sonal variation than the vitamin A con- 
tent. 

Discussion 

The contribution of vitamin A through 
the medium of dairy products is of ma- 
jor nutritional importance to the consum- 
ing public. Figure 1 shows that the 
lowest level of vitamin A potency of milk 
products occurs in the winter months 
when other foods comprising the human 
diet are also low in vitamin A. It 
would be most desirable if the vitamin 
A content of winter butterfat could be 
held at a higher level. 

Koehn, of the Alabama Station found 



12 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 434 



that the milk from cows placed on a 
temporary pasture of Abruzzi Italian rye, 
crimson and white Dutch clover in Feb- 
ruary, increased in 2 weeks time to a 
vitamin A content equal to that of good 
summer milk and remained at that level 
until the permanent pastures were ready 
for spring grazing. An equal increase 
in vitamin A can be expected from the 
grazing of any other growing cover crop. 

Oats, wheat and vetch, in particular, 
have become popular in many sections 
of Mississippi, The Dairy Department 
of Mississippi State College used a mix- 
ture of 1 Yz bushels oats, Yz bushel wheat, 
and 15 pounds vetch to the acre; more 
recently the amount of seed has been in- 
creased to 2 bushels oats, 1 bushel wheat, 
md 15 pounds vetch. 

While, from the standpoint of the nu- 
tritionist, this increase in vitamin A in 
dairy products is of particular importance, 
the actual benefits of direct value to the 
dairyman extend far beyond the improve- 
ment in the quality of milk. 

Financial Returns 

Numerous tests run by the Mississippi 
Station have shown that grazing winter 
cover crops is profitable, and consequent- 
ly cover crops grazing has been practiced 
by the Dairy Department for the past 
20 years. In a specific test reported by 
f. S. Moore in the December 1943 Farm 
Research, 12 acres were disked and plant- 
ed to oats and vetch in September. By 
November 10th there was a stand of oats 
averaging 8 to 15 inches in height. While 
the dairy herd was already on full win- 
ter ration, 52 cows and 18 heavy spring- 
ers were turned on this field for 15 days. 
The yield of milk increased 16.3 precent 
the first week and 24.6 percent during 
the second week. The value of the in- 
creased produciion, together with silage 
saved and $31.50 credit for the physical 
miprovement of the springers, were giv- 
en a minimum estimate of $176.55 that 
could be attributed to the first 15 days 



grazing. Ordinarily one or two more 
grazing periods can be expected depend- 
ing upon the season. 

Feed 

Moore reports another test wherein 80 
to 90 acres were planted to a mixture of 
oats, wheat and vetch. By the end of 
December sufficient grazing had been 
obtained from these crops to pay all costs 
of seed, preparation of land, and plant- 
ing. One field was not grazed after 
lanuary 1st. The seed was allowed to 
ripen and the crop was harvested for 
feed, yielding 1,678 pounds of grain and 
2,425 pounds of straw per acre. To secure 
this same feed value from corn as a grain 
crop would require a yield of about 30 
bushels of corn per acre. The winter graz- 
ing crop was grown when the land would 
otherwise have been idle, required no 
work after planting, and furnished a 
good cover crop which protected the soil 
from erosion during the winter months. 
A yield of IY4 tons of hay per acre was 
secured after fall and early spring graz- 
ing. This crop was removed early 
enough to plant corn. Where the grain 
was allowed to mature it was followed 
with sorghum for silage, sagrain for 
grain or silage, and soybeans for hay. 

Green Manure 

In the above test a portion of the 
crop was disked in for soil building. 
This was done on March 24th, after tak- 
mg the cows off on March 15th, and 
amounted to about 5,645 pounds of green 
manure to the acre. Some of the phos- 
phorus and potash of the soil was prob- 
ably conserved and changed to a more 
easily assimilated form, and it was esti- 
mated I6V2 additional pounds of nitro- 
gen were added to the soil together with 
organic matter. This organic matter im- 
proves the physical condition of the soil, 
permits greater infiltration of rainfall, 
and prevents or greatly diminishes soil 
loss diK \(' vvntcr erosion at the most 
critical period of the year.

Erosion 

Russell Woodburn reports that tests at 
the Mississippi Station show an average 
loss of 83 tons of soil per acre on a bare 
plot on a 9 percent slope over a 3-year 
period. A maximum loss of 141 tons 
per acre or almost one inch of soil oc- 
curred in 1944 due to the severe rainfall. 
A cotton plot nearby on a slope of 10 
percent, with winter vetch cover, lost 25 
tons per acre in 1944. This loss was 
almost entirely during the cotton season 
from April 1 to October 1. Of further 
interest is the fact that turning under 
vetch on other experimental plots permit- 
ted ten times more soil loss during the 
1944 cotton season than disking in. While 
the plot having the disked vetch lost 
2.3 tons of soil per acre from April to 
October, the bare plot lost 83 tons dur- 
ing the same period. 

Physical Condition of the Cow 

Kuhlman, of the Oklahoma Station, 
states that many dairy cattle in the South 
receive rations so low in carotene that 
normal functional performance cannot 
be attained. This is due to the feeding 



of large quantities of low grade hay, cot- 
tonseed hulls, and lack of good silage. 
The Oklahoma Station states that 40 to 
45 micrograms of carotene per pound 
body weight is about the minimum 
amount which will meet the daily re- 
quirements of cows of the Jersey breed, 
permit normal calving and the initiation 
of a normal lactation period. When the 
carotene intake fell below this point dur- 
ing the last 90 days before calving, many 
of the calves were either dead or very 
weak at birth, the cows developed symp- 
toms of vitamin A deficiency, and some 
indication of a shortened gestation pe- 
riod was noted.

Cotton Variety Tests in the Yazoo- 
Mississippi Delta, 1943-45 

By J. WINSTON NEELY and SIDNEY G. BRAIN 

Delta Branch Experiment Station, Stoneville 



For many years the Delta Branch Sta- 
tion has been testing varieties of cotton 
at Stoneville and on selected plantations 
in other representative sections of the 
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta in an effort to 
evaluate the performance of the various 
cottons under as nearly as possible the 
same conditions that they are to be 
grown by Delta planters. 

It has been the policy of the station to, 
adapt the variety tests to the current needs 
of producers, buyers, spinners, weavers, 
and oil-mill operators for information 
relative to the characteristics of varieties. 
During the time that the boll weevil was 
first becoming a factor in production, in- 
formation was obtained regarding the 
relative boll-weevil tolerance of cotton 
varieties because of earliness. When 
pathogenic wilt became a production fac- 
tor in some parts of the Delta, informa- 
tion was provided regarding the relative 
wilt resistance of the different varieties. 

At the present time cotton mills are 
paying a great deal of attention to ten- 
sile strength of fiber and fiber length uni- 
formity, since these characteristics, along 
with length, give an indication of the 
resulting manufacturing quality of the 
cotton. The current report is the third 
from the Delta Station in which tensile 
strength of fiber and fiber length uni- 
formity for each of the varieties grown 
at each of the locations have been re- 
ported. 

As additional information relative to 
the characteristics of cotton varieties is 
required, the tests will be planned to 
supply as much of this information as 
possible. 

During the past 3 years, the follow- 
ing characteristics of the most common- 



ly planted varieties have been determin- 
ed: (1) Yield of seed cotton, (2) yield 
of lint, (3) gin turn-out, (4) staple 
length, (5) size of boll, (6) earliness, 
(7) fiber tensile strength, (8) length uni- 
formity of fiber, and (9) money value 
per acre. 

The yields of seed cotton are based 
upon the weights harvested from ten, 
one-row plots at each location each sea- 
son. 

The yields of lint are based upon the 
respective yields of seed cotton and gin 
turn-outs. 

Gm turn-out values were determined 
by ginning ten, 100-boll samples which 
were picked trom each variety at each 
location during each of the three sea- 
sons. 

The staple lengths of each variety at 
each location were determined by class- 
ers of the Staple Cotton Cooperative As- 
sociation, Greenwood, Mississippi, and 
of the Greenwood office of the Board of 
Cotton Examiners, Production and Mar- 
keting Administration, of the U. S. De- 
partment of Agriculture. 

The sizes of boll are based upon the 
average weight of ten, 100-boll samples 
from each variety at each location. 

The percentage of cotton obtained from 
the first picking, which is considered a 
measure of earliness, was determined by 
dividing the weight of the first picking 
by the weight of the total production. 

The fiber tensile strength and the 
length uniformity of fiber were de- 
termined in the Stoneville Fiber Labora- 
tory of the Production and Marketing 
Administration. 

The money values per acre are based 
upon: (1) Yields of seed and lint, (2)

values for three grades — Middling, Strict 
Low Middling, and Low Middling — are 
given. The average prices for cotton of 
the respective grades and several lengths 
for 10 weeks of the 1945 marketing sea- 
son in Memphis were used. The seed 
were evaluated on a basis of $56 per ton, 
with premiums and discounts in accord- 
ance with official standards for grading 
cottonseed set up by the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. The seed analyses 
were made in the Stoneville Laboratory 
of the Production and Marketing Ad- 
ministration of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture. 

The current report is divided into two 
parts: (1) The 1945 tests, and (2) the 
1943 to 1945 tests. 

Results of the 1945 Tests 

During the 1945 season the Delta 
Branch Experiment Station conducted 
cotton variety tests at the following lo- 
cations in the Yazoo-Mississippi . Delta: 
Stoneville, Jonestown, Money, Heathman, 
Valley Hill, Yazoo City, and Kelso. 

Excessive amounts of rainfall during 
the planting, growing, and harvesting 



seasons occurred at all locations. 
Stoneville Test 

The Stoneville test was located at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station and 
was conducted in cooperation with the 
late J. W. Whitaker, county agent of 
Washington County. The soil is a sandy 
loam, typical of banks along upper Deer 
Creek. A nitrogenous fertilizer was 
"bedded on" about 2 weeks before plant- 
ing. The test was planted on April 27. 
The first picking was made on Septem- 
ber 18, and the second and third pickings 
were made on October 11 and December 
7, respectively. Results of the 1945 
Stoneville tests are given in table 1. 

When comparisons are based upon 
Middling grade, the following varieties 
were leading money-value producers: 
Delfos 9169, Coker 100-9, Stoneville 2B, 
Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, and Delfos 
444. If comparisons are made on the 
basis of Strict Low Middling grade, the 
leading varieties are Delfos 9169, Stone- 
ville 2B, Coker 100-9, Coker 100-Staple 
Strain 1, Miller, and Bobshaw 1. The 
following varieties are leading money- 
value producers when comparisons are

ple Strain 1. 

Jonestown Test 

The Jonestown test was conducted in 
cooperation with Carey Cocke, Jr., farm 
operator, and Harris Barnes, county 
agent of Coahoma County. The test is 
located on the Eagle Nest Plantation west 
of Jonestown. The soil is a sandy loam 
and is well drained. A nitrogenous fer- 
tilizer was "bedded on" and the test 
planted on May 11. The first and sec- 
ond pickings were made on October 18 
and February 21, respectively. The 
plants were rank. There was a light 
boll-weevil infestation and considerable 
boll rot. Pathogenic wilt killed a few 
plants but probably was of no conse- 
quence. There was some falling out of 
cotton between the first and last pick- 
ings, but very little difference in this 
respect between varieties was noted. The 
results of the tests conducted at Jones- 
town in 1945 are given in table 2. 

The upper money value producing 
group includes Delfos 9169, Bobdel, 
Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, Bobshaw 1, 



Delfos 53 IC, and Miller when compari- 
sons are made on the basis of Middling 
grade. Delfos 9169, Bobdel, Bobshaw 1, 
Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, Miller, and 
Delfos 531C are leading money-value 
producers in the Strict Low Middling 
comparisons. Delfos 9169, Bobshaw 1, 
Bobdel, Miller, and Coker 100-Staple 
Strain 1 lead in regard to money value 
per acre when comparisons are based 
upon the Low Middling grade. 

Money Test 
In cooperation with H. L. Gary, presi- 
dent of Wildwood, Incorporated, and J. 
S. McBee, county agent of Leflore Coun- 
ty, a test was conducted near Money on 
the east banks of the Tallahatchie River. 
The soil is a fine, sandy loam and is well 
drained. A nitrogenous fertilizer was 
"bedded on" before planting. The test 
was planted on April 19. "Damping 
off" of seedlings resulted in irregular 
stands, but apparently none of the vari- 
eties were discriminated against because 
of poor stands. The first picking was 
made on September 28 and the second 
picking on November 23. The results 
of the 1945 Money tests are given in 
table 3.

of Bobshaw Chemurgic Plantation, and 
H. A. Carpenter, county agent. The 
field is located on Highway 82. The 
soil is a light colored, well drained, silt 
loam. A nitrogenous fertilizer was "bed- 
ded on" before planting. The test was 
planted on May 5. Stands were irregular 
due to "damping off," but apparently 
none of the varieties were discriminated 
against because of poor stands. Boll- 
weevil infestations were heavy. The first 
picking was made on September 24 and 
the second picking on November 28. The 
results of the Heathman test are given 
in table 4. 

When comparisons were made upon 
the basis of Middling or Strict Low Mid- 
dling grades, Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, 
Delfos 53 IC, and Delfos 444 were lead- 
ing money-value-per-acre producers. Cok- 
er 100-Staple Strain 1, Delfos 444, Delfos 
531C, Delfos 9169, and Stoneville 2B 
produced significantly higher money val- 
ues per acre than did the other varieties 
when comparisons were based upon Low 
Middling grade. 



Valley Hill Test 

In cooperation with L. S. Hemphill, 
landowner, and R. A. Cooper, county 
agent, a test was conducted at Valley 
Hill in Carroll County about 6 miles 
east of Greenwood on Highway 82. The 
test is on the eastern border of the Delta. 
The surface soil is a light colored, well 
drained, silt loam made up of outwash 
from the hills. A nitrogeous fertilizer 
was "bedded on" before planting. The 
test was planted on May 23. An earlier 
planting on April 20 failed to give suf- 
ficient stands. Pathogenic wilt was very 
bad. Delfos 651, Delfos 444, Delfos 
531C, Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, and 
Coker 100-9 were the most susceptible 
varieties. Miller and Bobshaw 1 were 
the most resistant varieties. Boll-weevil 
infestations were very heavy, and losses 
due to weevil were of some consequence, 
particularly in the late varieties. The 
test was picked on October 19. Earliness 
data are not available. The results of the 
1945 Valley Hill test are given in table 5. 

Delfos 9169, Bobdel, Miller, Bobshaw 
1, and Coker 100-S'taple Strain 1 were

leading money-value producers when 
comparisons were made upon the basis 
of Middhng grade. 

When comparisons were made on the 
basis of Strict Low Middling or Middhng 
grades, Delfos 9169, Bobdel, Miller, and 
Bobshaw 1 were leading money-value- 
per-acre producers. 

Yazoo City Test 

The Yazoo City test was conducted on 
the Marx Schaefer farm 3 miles west of 
Yazoo City in cooperation with Mr. 
Schaefer and with A. R. Ruby, county 
agent of Yazoo County. The soil is a 
fine sandy loam and is well drained. A 
nitrogenous fertilizer was "bedded on" 
and the test planted on April 12. There 
was considerable "damping off" of seed- 
lings, but the stands were fairly good. 
The plants grew tall, and the foliage was 
very heavy. Boll rot and boll-weevil in- 
festations were very bad. The test was 
picked on September 26 and again on 
November 29. Results of the Yazoo 
City test are given in table 6. 

Leading money-value producers were 
Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, Delfos 9169, 



Deltapine 14, Bobshaw 1, Delfos 444. 
Delfos 531C, Delfos 651, and Stoneville 
2B when comparisons are made on the 
basis of Middling grade. Delfos 9169. 
Deltapine 14, Coker 100-Staple Strain 1. 
Bobshaw 1, Delfos 444, Stoneville 2B. 
Delfos 531C, and Delfos 651 lead in re- 
gard to money value per acre when com 
parisons are based upon Strict Low Mid- 
dling grade. When comparisons are 
based upon Low Middling grade, the 
following varieties were the leading 
money-value producers: Deltapine 14. 
Delfos 9169, Bobshaw 1, Coker 100- 
Staple Strain 1, Stoneville 2B, Delfos 
444, and Delfos 531C. 

Kelso Test 

The Kelso test was conducted in ca 
operation with James Hand of Kelso 
Plantation and C. L. Cary, county agent 
of Sharkey County. It is located on the 
Sharkey-Issaquena county line 11 miles 
south of Cary on Highway 61. The 
soil is a sandy loam and is well drained. 
The test was planted in check rows on 
April 17. The rows were 40 inches apart 
each way. Six plants were left in each

hill. The plants grew very tall, and the 
foliage was very heavy. Boll-wcevil in 
festations were bad. The entire produc- 
tion was picked on October 16. Earli- 
ness data were 'not obtained. Results of 
the 1945 Kelso test are given in table 7. 

Delfos 53 IC, Stoneville 2B, Delfos 444. 
Cooker 100-9, Delfos 651, Coker 100- 
Staple Strain I, and Delfos 9169 were 
leading money-value-per-acre producers 
when comparisons were made on the 
basis of Middling and Strict Low Mid- 
dling grades. When comparisons were 
made on the basis of Low Middling 
grade, Stoneville 2B, Delfos 531C, Del- 
fos 444, Coker 100-9, Delfos 651, Delfos 
9169, and Bobshaw 1 were leading 
money-value-per-acre producers. 

Results From 2- and 3-Year 
Variety Studies 

Seasonal conditions have a marked ef- 
fect upon the yield and other character- 
istics of cotton varieties. For this rea- 
son, data from a variety study conducted 
for only one season are probably not in- 
dicative of long-time performance. The 
results obtained by averaging the data 



obtained by conducting variety tests over 
a period of years provide much more 
useful information. 

Variety tests similar to those describ- 
ed above were conducted during the 3 
years 1943 to 1945 at Stoneville, Money, 
Heathman, Valley Hill, and Yazoo City, 
and during the years 1944 and 1945 at 
Kelso. Only 10 varieties were common 
to tests grown during all of the seasons. 

Methods of conducting the tests, col- 
lecting samples, and analyzing data are 
the same as outlined for the 1945 tests. 
Dates of planting and picking at the 
different locations in 1943 and 1944 are 
given in bulletins 398 and 416 of the 
Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. The, dates for the 1945 tests were 
given earlier in this report. 

The 1943 and 1944 growing seasons in 
the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta were char- 
acterized by marked deficiencies of soil 
moisture during the boll-maturation per- 
iod. The staple lengths of all varieties 
were shorter than normal, and the 
lengths of Bobdel, Coker 100, and the 
Delfos strains were affected more by dry

weather than were the lengths of the 
slower maturing varieties. Excessive 
amounts of rainfall during the planting, 
growing, and harvesting seasons occurred 
at all locations in 1945. 

The yields of seed cotton and lint, gin 
turn-out, staple length, boll size, earli- 
ness, fiber tensile strength, uniformity of 
fiber length, and total money values, 
based upon Middling, Strict Low Mid- 
dling, and Low MiddHng, are given in 
tables 8 to 13 for the respective locations. 

The yields of seed cotton were deter- 
mined by averaging the seed cotton yields 
obtained during each of the seasons that 
the tests were conducted at a given loca- 
tion. 

The yield of lint was obtained by mul- 
tiplying the average gin turn-out by the 
average yield of seed cotton per acre. 

The gin turn-out data presented in 
each table were obtained by determining 
the mean lint percentages of 30 samples 
for each variety for the 3-year tests and of 
20 samples for the 2-year tests. 

The staple length, the number of bolls 
required for a pound of seed cotton, the 
percent of seed cotton picked during the 
first picking, the fiber tensile strength, 
and the fiber length uniformity ratio, 
were determined by averaging the values 
obtained for each variety during the sea- 
sons that the tests were conducted at a 



given location. 

The total money values per acre were 
obtained by using the average yields of 
seed cotton and lint, the average staple 
length for the 2- or 3-year period, the 
average seed grade for 1944 and 1945, 
and the price of lint for the respective 
grades and lengths for 1945. 

During the 3-year period 1943 to 1945, 
the leading money value producing va- 
rieties at Stoneville were Stoneville 2B, 
Deltapine 14, and Coker 100. 

At Money the leading money-value 
producers were Stoneville 2B, Deltapine 
14, and Bobshaw 1. 

The leading money-value producers at 
Heathman, based on the 3-year averages, 
were Stoneville 2B and Deltapine 14. 

Stoneville 2B, Miller, Bobshaw 1, and 
Deltapine 14 were leading money-value 
producers at Valley Hill during the 3- 
year period. 

The total money values produced by 
Deltapine 14, Stoneville 2B, and Bob- 
shaw 1 were higher than the values pro- 
duced by the other seven varieties at 
Yazoo City during the years 1943 to 
1945. 

A.t Kelso the leading money-value pro- 
ducing varieties during the 2-year period 
1944 to 1945 were Delfos 531C, Coker 
100, and Stoneville 2B.

PRODUCTION OF HAIRY VETCH AND ITS UTILIZATION 
FOR COTTON PRODUCTION 



By J. L. ANTHONY 



The use of winter legumes for soil 
improvement has greatly increased in 
Mississippi during comparatively recent 
years. 

Of the several kinds of winter legumes 
adapted to Mississippi conditions, vetch 
is by far the most popular. Of the total 
acreage seeded in 1945, more than half 
was seeded to vetch. 

Although sometimes utilized for hay, 
or seed, or grazing, winter legumes are 
mainly grown in Mississippi for soil im- 
provement; and for this purpose are 
turned or plowed under in early spring 
and in time for planting the succeeding 
crop, usually cotton or corn. 

No information is available as to the 
number of acres of cotton and corn, re- 
spectively, which follow vetch plowed 
under. Personal observation and esi- 
mates gathered at random from unofficial 
sources seem to indicate that approxi- 
mately three-fourths of the vetch plowed 
under in Mississippi is followed by cot- 
ton, and approximately one-fourth by 
corn. 

Problems in Vetch Production and 
Utilization 

Many years ago when farmers in large 
numbers first began to plant winter le- 
gumes for soil improvement, the prob- 
lems of production and utilization ap- 
peared to be quite simple of solution. 
From early writings it appeared that all 
one had to do to secure bumper yields 
was to sow winter legumes in the fall 
and turn them in the spring. Disap- 
pointments were quite common during 
the early days of vetch history, due per- 
haps most largely to lack of knowledge 
of plant food nutrients required for the 
optimum production of vetch, as well as 
the closely related plant food require^ 



ments for the optimum production of 
cotton following vetch. 

The Mississippi Agricultural Experi- 
ment Station has done much work with 
vetch, especially during the past 12 years. 
Publications reporting this work have 
shown that in the hill sections of Missis- 
sippi, annual applications of phosphate 
are required for best vetch production. 
In common with other legumes, vetch 
has the capacity under favored growing 
conditions, to draw its requirements in 
nitrogen from the air. Cotton requires 
a complete fertilizer including nitrogen, 
phosphate, and potash; and cotton follow- 
ing vetch turned under utilizes the vetch 
plant residue, including nitrogen, so that 
most or all of the nitrogen is thus se- 
cured, leaving only potash and phosphate 
required for optimum cotton produc- 
tion. 

Experiments have shown that an ex- 
cellent crop of vetch plowed under sup- 
plies nitrogen available to the succeed- 
ing plant equivalent to about 32 pounds 
of actual nitrogen from commercial ma- 
terials (200 pounds nitrate of soda, 100 
pounds ammonium nitrate, or other 
equivalent material in nitrogen content). 
In addition to nitrogen (which vetch 
draws from the air and which the suc- 
ceeding crop of cotton draws from the 
decomposed vetch material) both cotton 
ind vetch require phosphate, potash, and 
probably lime. 

That the relationship of vetch produc- 
tion and utlilization is a complex one 
is apparent when two important factors 
are kept in mind: (1) Used for soil im- 
provement, vetch is valued exactly to the 
extent that yields of the following crops 
are increased; and (2) the needs and re- 
quirements for optimum production of 
both vetch and cotton must be consider-

ed, and that in relation to the soil and 
Its cropping history. 

Numerous farmers who produce vetch 
toi soil improvement have been con- 
fronted with numerous problems incident 
CO the two crops. 

For example, since phosphate and pot- 
ash are required by both vetch and cot- 
ton in the hill sections of Mississippi, 
many farmers are asking questions such 
is these: 

May the needed amounts of phosphate 
and potash be applied either to vetch or 
cotton with equal results and with equal 
benefits in increased cotton yields? 

Should the fertilizer application be 
made to the vetch or to the cotton, or 
should the required amounts be used in 
split applications, one-half applied to 
vetch and one-half to cotton? 

Another question in which farmers 
are interested: Since relatively largf" yields 
of vetch are often produced, and s.nce 
hay is produced in insufficient quantities 
on most Mississippi farms, would it be a 
profitable practice to use the vetch as 
hay and to apply required amounts of 
commercial nitrogen to the following 
crop of cotton? 

In a vetch-cotton rotation, how neces- 
sary is potash, and what quantities should 
be used for maximum profit? 

What is the place of lime in the vetch- 
cotton production program? 

Fertilizer Experiments Conducted 

To more nearly determine the effect of 
crop removal on the plant food supply 
of soils, to study the relationship existing 
between vetch production and cotton 
production, and to secure answers to 
many of the problems confronting farm- 
ers who utilize vetch for soil improve- 
ment, the Mississippi Experiment Station, 
in cooperation with the Tennessee Val- 
ley Authority, is conducting experiments 
at two locations in Mississippi. 



On the farm of W. M. and R. C. 
Stinson, Lowndes County, Columbus, 
Mississippi, crop responses on Savannah 
fine sandy loam, a yellowish, sandy clay 
soil, have been studied. 

The topography of the plot land is 
level to gently rolling, and the soil is 
fairly productive when properly ferti- 
lized. 

In the main, this soil is usually low in 
its native supply of phosphorus and pot- 
ash, and before maximum cotton produc- 
tion can be obtained, liberal amounts of 
these plant food nutrients must be sup- 
plied. This is especially true if winter 
legumes are used to furnish the nitro- 
gen for the following crop of cotton. 

At the Holly Springs Branch Station, 
Holly Springs, Mississippi, crop response 
on Grenada silt loam soil has been 
studied. The soil is largely silt and is 
fairly well drained. The topography is 
almost level and the soil is fairly pro- 
ductive even without fertilizer. Many 
crops, however, respond to fertilizers 
when applied and good yields are ob- 
tained in most cases. 

Experiments on Savannah 
Fine Sandy Loam Soils 

In the experiment conducted on the 
Stinson farm near Columbus, Mississippi, 
the following problems were studied: 

1. The effect on the production of 
vetch of 500 pounds 0-8-4 fertilizer per 
acre, applied to vetch rather than to the 
succeeding cotton, whether the vetch is 
cut for hay or turned under. 

2. The efTect on the production of 
vetch of 500 pounds of 0-8-4 fertilizer per 
acre applied to cotton, rather than to 
the vetch, whether the vetch is cut for 
hay or turned under. 

3. The eflect of fertilized vetch (re- 
moved for hay) on the production of 
the following crop of unfertilized cotton. 

4. The effect of fertihzed vetch

14. The effect of an additional 100 
pounds of 50 percent muriate of potash

Fertilizer Applied to Vetch or Cotton 
Since under the conditions of this test 
and according to numerous other experi- 
ments, both cotton and vetch require 
liberal amounts of phosphorus and per- 
haps of potash for optimum production, 
especially when the vetch is removed for 
hay, two questions naturally arise: 

1. Should required amounts of ferti- 
lizer be applied to vetch or to cotton; and 

2. What effect does removing a crop 
of vetch for hay have on the succeeding 
crop of cotton.^ 

The results (table I7 indicate a slight 



6 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 436 



advantage in the direct application of 
the fertilizer to cotton rather than to 
vetch, and that cotton yields following 
vetch removed for hay were reduced con- 
siderably. 

In the comparison in which vetch was 
removed for hay, where the fertilizer was 
applied to vetch and none to cotton, the 
succeeding crop of cotton yielded 709 
pounds of seed cotton per acre; where 
the vetch was unfertilized and the suc- 
ceeding crop of cotton was fertilized, the 
yield of seed cotton was 872 pounds. 

In the comparison in which the vetch 
was turned under, cotton following the 
fertilized vetch crop yielded 953 pounds, 
whereas fertilized cotton following un- 
fertilized vetch yielded 1072 pounds. 

Vetch Cut for Hay or Turned 

In this test the same comparisons are 
shown for vetch as for cotton, and sim- 
ilar results were obtained. The results 
(table 1) indicate slightly higher yields 
of vetch when the fertilizer was applied 
to vetch rather than to cotton, and that 
vetch yields following the removal of 
vetch for hay were less than yields of 
vetch after the preceding crops of* vetch 
had been turned under. 

In the comparison in which the vetch 
was removed for hay: where the vetch 
was fertilized and cotton unfertilized, 
the succeeding crop of vetch yielded 4,815 
pounds of green vetch per acre; where 
the vetch was unfertilized and the suc- 
ceeding crop of cotton was fertilized, the 
yield of green vetch was 3,489 pounds. 

In the comparison in which the ferti- 
lized vetch was turned and followed by 
unfertilized cotton, the vetch yield was 
5,533 pounds; whereas unfertilized vetch 
following fertilized cotton yielded 4,227 
pounds. 

It is clear from the foregoing that vetch 
produced for the purpose of increasing 
cotton production is more efficiently uti- 
lized when the entire crop is turned un- 



der than when the hay is removed and 
only the roots and stubble are turned 
under. 

It will be noted that cotton following 
vetch removed for hay produced 244 
pounds less seed cotton per acre than 
cotton following turned vetch. It ap- 
pears that the removal of vetch for hay 
had less effect on the production of vetch 
than on cotton, since an increase of less 
than 1000 pounds were obtained follow- 
ing turned vetch. 

The discussion above relates only the 
average yield and increase yields, since 
annual yields do not show definite trends 
due largely to weather conditions. For 
instance, during the year of 1941, the 
vetch and cotton crops on the Stinson 
farm resulted in a complete failure, 
weather conditions being such that vetch 
yields were negligible. The following 
crop of cotton was planted in early May, 
but there was not enough moisture to 
germinate the seed, and stands were not 
secured until after July 1. Cotton made 
good growth and put on a good crop of 
fruit, but was entirely destroyed by the 
boll weevil. 

Commercial Nitrogen Applied to Cotton 
Following Fertilized and Unfertilized 
Vetch Removed for Hay 

Vetch grown for the purpose of in- 
creasing cotton production is more ef- 
ficiently utilized when the entire crop 
is turned than when the hay is removed 
and only the roots and stubble are turn 
ed. However, economic factors may en 
ter into the picture on many farms, and 
the value of vetch-hay must not be over- 
looked. It will be noted (table 1) that 
cotton following fertilized vetch removed 
for hay produced approximately 250 
pounds of seed cotton per acre less than 
when the vetch was turned, and ferti- 
lized cotton following unfertilized vetch 
removed for hay produced approximate- 
ly 150 pounds seed cotton per acre less

than when the vetch was turned. The 
question then arises: Can the vetch tops 
be removed as hay without loss in yield 
if the required amount of commercial 
nitrogen is applied to the cotton crop? 

The use of 100 pounds of nitrate of 
.o(ja per acre applied to cotton following 
fcriilizcd and unfertilized vetch removed 
for hay increased cotton yields 58 pounds 
ind 97 pounds of seed cotton per acre, 
respectively, over yields where the vetch 
was turned and no additional nitrogen 
was supplied. 

Vctcii yields were not affected by the 
commercial nitrogen applied to cotton. 
When the vetch was fertilized with 500 
pounds of 0-8-4 fertilizer per acre, the 
yield of green vetch was approximately 
5000 pounds, which is in the neighbor- 
hood of one ton of hay. Removal o! 
approximately a ton of hay necessitates 
the application of 100 pounds of soda 
(or equivalent) per acre to maintain and 
slightly increase cotton yields. 

Whether it is preferable to turn under 
[he vetch crop, or to harvest it for hay 
and add nitrogen fertilizer, is a matter 



for the individual farmer to determine. 
The Application of Lime in Addition to 
Phosphorus and Potash 

In one of the comparisons made in the 
[est, 500 pounds of lime was applied in 
addition to the 500 pounds 0-8-4 fertilizer 
applied under vetch. This treatment 
yielded 5,660 pounds of green vetch per 
.icre, and was slightly more than when 
the same fertilizer was applied without 
lime. 

The cotton which followed the ferti- 
lized and lime-treated vetch received no 
additional fertilizer and yielded 1,042 
pounds of seed cotton. This is the high- 
"st yield of cotton in the vetch series, 
and was 89 pounds superior to the no- 
lime treatment. The data are shown in 
table 3. 

The Value of Basic Slag for Vetch 
and Cotton 

The application of 500 pounds per acre 
>i 0-8-0 (basic slag) under vetch result- 
ed in the production of 4,203 pounds of 
:rctn veich. The following crop of cot- 
•on, unfertilized, yielded 648 pounds of 
»eed cotton.

The split application of basic slag (ap- 
plied at the rate of 250 pounds 0-8-0 
under vetch and 250 pounds under cot- 
con) produced approximately the same 
amounts of vetch and cotton as did the 
single application of 500 pounds applied 
to vetch. 

Yields under these basic slag treatments' 
were the lowest in the test with the ex- 
ception of the crop receiving no vetch 
and no fertilizer, and compare with 1,042 
pounds of seed cotton per acre produced 
on the plots on which fertilizer and lime 
were applied to the vetch and no ferti- 
lizer was applied to the following crop 
of cotton. 

Basic slag contains approximately 10 
percent of P^'Or. anJ approximately 50 per- 
cent lime. It contains no potash. That 
potash may be essential to optimum pro- 
duction on this soil is indicated by a 
test made in 1945 in which additional 
quantities of potash were used and which 
is discussed in a following section. 
Complete Fertilizer Applied to Cotton 

The highest 6-year average yield of 
seed cotton in the test was made when 
500 pounds of 6-8-4 complete fertilizer 
per acre was applied to cotton and no 
vetch was employed (table 5). This 
treatment yielded 1,087 pounds seed cot- 



ton per acre, compared with 1,027 pounds 
when 500 pounds of 0-8-4 fertilizer was 
applied to cotton following unfertilized 
vetch, to 1,042 pounds following vetch 
fertilized with 500 pounds 0-8-4 and 500 
pounds of dolomitic limestone, and to 
455 pounds when no vetch and no ferti- 
lizer were used. 

Since the same amounts of phosphate 
and potash were used on the vetch and 
no-vetch plots, there is a direct compari- 
son of vetch nitrogen and commercial 
nitrogen. The results agree with num- 
erous other results of tests in the hill 
section, in indicating that a good crop 
of vetch is equal in cotton yield to 24 to 
32 pounds of nitrogen (obtained from -75 
to ^0 pounds of nitrate of soda or ^ ^ 
to-^ pounds of ammonium nitrate). 

It is evident that for best cotton pro- 
duction on this soil, adequate fertiliza- 
tion is necessary, for yields were approxi- 
mately doubled by both treatments. It 
is evident, too, that it makes little or no 
difference whether the nitrogen is se- 
cured from commercial sources or from 
vetch grown and turned under to supply 
the nitrogen. 

Additional Potash Applied During 1945

ash may profitably be used for cotton

production, 100 pounds of 50 percent 
muriate of potash per acre in addition to 
the specified annual applications was ap- 
plied to cotton on one-half of all plots in 
the spring of 1945. The results are shown 
in table 6, 

With minor exceptions, the several 
comparisons clearly indicate that on this 
soil an abundant supply of potash is re- 
quired for optimum cotton production. 
In two of the comparisons the addition 
of 100 pounds of potash resulted in a 
loss in cotton production. It appears that 
when the 0-8-4 fertilizer was applied di- 
rectly to cotton following unfertilized 
turned vetch, there was sufJicient potash 
for optimum production, and that when 
cotton was fertilized with a complete 
fertilizer (500 pounds 6-8-4, no vetch) 
there was also no need for additional 
potash. These results are for 1945 only, 
hence are to be accepted only as a lead. 

The outstanding response to additional 
potash was shown by the two basic slag 
treatments. These plots, of coure, receiv- 
ed no potash, whereas all other fertilized 
plots in the test received 40 pounds of 
muriate of potash per acre annually for 
the 6-year period. 

Without potash, the basic slag plots 
[produced 648 and 657 pounds of seed 
cotton per acre, respectively, during the 



6-year period, and each produced 928 
pounds during the single year 1945. 
These yields were the lowest in the test, 
except the untreated plot which received 
neither fertilizer nor vetch. 

With the application of 100 pounds of 
potash during 1945, the plot on which 
500 pounds of 0-8-0 (basic slag) per acre 
was applied under vetch gave a yield of 
1,979 pounds, an increase of 1,051 pounds 
seed cotton per acre. The crop on which 
250 pounds 0-8-0 (basic slag) was applied 
to the vetch plus 250 pounds applied to 
the cotton, was increased to 2,056, an in- 
crease due to potash of 1,127 pounds per 
acre. 

It is worthy of note that without pot- 
ash the two basic slag plots were lowest 
in yield among the treated plots, but 
that with the additional potash the basic 
slag plots were second and third highest 
in the 1945 test. 

Unfertilized cotton following turned 
vetch fertilized with 500 pounds of 0-8-4 
and 500 pounds of lime per acre, pro- 
duced the highest yields of seed cotton 
in the vetch series for the 6-year period. 
The 6-year average was 1,042 pounds 
seed cotton. The production for the one 
year 1945 was 1,880 pounds without ad- 
ditional potash, and 2,232 pounds with 
additional potash, an increase of 352

pounds of seed cotton per acre due to ad- 
ditional potash. 

Plots that received the same fertilizer 
treatment as above but having no lime, 
produced a 6-year average yield of 953 
pounds of seed cotton per acre. The 
1945 yield without additional potash was 
1,771 pounds, whereas the plots receiv 
ing additional potash yielded 1,931 
pounds, an increase of 160 pounds due 
to additional potash. 

The yields of cotton following vetch 
removed for hay were less than those 
following turned vetch in every case. 
However, when the fertilizer was applied 
directly to the cotton, the cotton yields 
were reduced less than when the ferti- 
lizer was applied to the vetch and follow- 
ed by unfertilized cotton. 

Additional potash applied to the 1945 
cotton crop, following fertilized vetch re- 
moved for hay, produced 1,416 pounds 
seed cotton per acre as compared to 1,040 
pounds without additional potash, an in- 
crease of 376 pounds due to additional 
potash. Additional potash applied to the 
cotton crop in 1945 following fertilized 
turned vetch produced 1,931 pounds of 
seed cotton per acre, whereas without 
additional potash the yield was 1,771 
pounds, an increase of 160 pounds. 
Fertilized cotton following unfertiliz- 



ed vetch removed for hay produced 1,394 
pounds of seed cotton for the one year 
1945; but when 100 pounds of addition- 
al potash was applied to fertilized cot- 
10.'^ following unfertilized vetch removed 
for hay, the cotton yield was 1,552 
pounds, an increase of 158 pounds. 

It is interesting to note that cotton 
yields were slightly depressed when ad- 
ditional potash was applied to cotton fer- 
tilized annually with 500 pounds 0-8-4 
and following unfertilized turned vetch. 
Plots receiving the additional potash 
yielded 1,752 pounds seed cotton per acre, 
whereas the plot that had not been ferti- 
lized with additional potash yielded 1,856 
pounds, a loss of 104 pounds seed cotton 
per acre. 

The cotton plot that had been ferti- 
lized annually with 500 pounds 6-8-4 per 
acre (no vetch) yielded 1,888 pounds 
seed cotton in 1945 without additional 
potash and 1,819 pounds with additional 
potash, which also resulted in a loss of 
69 pounds seed cotton. It is entirely 
possible that the decline in cotton yields 
in both cases was due to soil variations 
rather than to the potash treatment. 
However, it is evident when applied di- 
rectly to cotton that the 20 pounds of 
actual potash carried in 500 pounds of 
0-8-4 and 6-8-4 is enough to supply the

potash needed for good cotton produc- 
tion on this soil, even with turned-under 
vetch in the picture. 

In one comparison cotton fertiHzed an- 
nually with 500 pounds of 3-8-4 per acre 
arn following unfertilized vetch remov- 
ed for hay, yielded 1,664 pounds of seed 
cotton per acre for the year 1945; cotton 
receiving the same fertilizer treatment 
plus 100 pounds of muriate of potash per 
acre yielded 1,947 pounds, an increase 
of 283 pounds of seed cotton per acre. 

The no-vetch, no-fertilizer plot yield- 
ed 632 pounds of seed cotton per acre, 
as compared to 675 pounds when the 
additional 100 pounds of muriate of 



potash was applied, an increase of only 
13 pounds of seed cotton. This perhaps 
indicates that adequate quantities of all 
three plant food nutrients are required, 
nitrogen and phosphorus as well as pot- 
ash. 

Summary of Experiments Conducted on 
Savannah Fine Sandy Loam Soil 

Cotton and vetch production studies 
were made on the farm of W. iM. and 
R. C. Stinson near Columbus, Mississip- 
pi. The soil was Savannah fine sandy 
loam, a fairly productive soil when ade- 
quate quantities of plant fond nutrients 
are supplied. 



12 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 436 



These studies during the 6-year and 7- 
year period seem to indicate the follow- 
ing: 

1. In order to produce cotton at prof- 
itable levels on soils that are not natural- 
ly fertile, annual applications of phos- 
phate nutrients are required whether in 
a soil improvement program making use 
of legumes, or whether by the applica- 
tion of sufficient amounts of complete 
fertilizers. 

2. Vetch produced for soil improve- 
ment is best utilized when turned back to 
the soil; however, by using 100 pounds 
of nitrate of soda per acre applied to 
cotton following vetch removed for hay, 
the cotton yields are slightly better than 
yields obtained from cotton following 
turned vetch. 

3. Annual applications of lime ap- 
plied to vetch at the rate of 500 pounds 
per acre for the 7-year period, did not 
increase vetch yields; however, cotton 
yields were significantly increased when 
lime was applied to the vetch and fol- 
lowed by cotton. 

4. Basic slag alone applied to vetch 
at the rate of 500 pounds 0-8-0 per acre 
yielded less green vetch and less seed 
cotton than any of the 0-8-4 fertilizer 
treatments where the vetch was turned 
under. 

5. The 500 pounds of 6-8-4 fertilizer 
treatment (no vetch) produced a 6-year 
average yield of 1,087 pounds of seed 
cotton per acre, whereas the 0-8-4 ferti- 
lizer plus vetch nitrogen yielded 1,027 
pounds, and the no-vetch and no-ferti- 
lizer plot yielded only 455 pounds. A 
slight advantage was shown for com- 
mercial nitrogen over vetch nitrogen. 

6. Potash applied at the rate of 100 
pounds per acre under cotton in 1945 
and following vetch fertilized with basic 
slag at the rate of 500 pounds 0-8-0 per 
acre, and the split application of 250 
pounds of 0-8-0 basic slag applied to 



cotton — increased yields of seed cotton 
1,051 pounds and 1,127 pounds, respec- 
tively. Yields of vetch following the 
1945 treatment of potash applied to cot- 
ton were increased 2,528 pounds and 2,784 
pounds of green vetch per acre, respec- 
tively. 

Additional potash increased cotton 
yields 160 pounds and 376 pounds of 
seed cotton per acre, respectively, follow- 
ing turned and removed vetch fertilized 
with 500 pounds 0-8-4 fertilizer per acre, 
and 352 pounds following turned vetch 
fertilized with 500 pounds of 0-8-4 ferti- 
lizer plus 500 pounds of lime per acre. 

Additional potash applied to unferti- 
lized cotton following fertilized vetch 
was by far more valuable than when 
applied to fertilized cotton following un- 
fertilized vetch. 

Experiments on Grenada 
Silt Loam Soil 

In the experiment conducted on the 
Holly Springs Branch Station, at Holly 
Springs, Mississippi, the same problems 
were studied as on the Stinson farm near 
Columbus, with one exception. Field ob- 
servations and results obtained at this 
location indicated that this soil is fairly 
well supplied with potash, therefore the 
use of additional potash was not tested. 

Vetch Removed for Hay or Turned 
Under 

In two of the treatments, direct com- 
parisons may be had of the vetch yields 
when removed for hay and when turned 
under, and the yields of the following 
crops of cotton when the vetch was re- 
moved for hay or turned. In both cases 
it is clear that for optimum cotton pro- 
duction vetch should be turned rather 
than removed for hay. In point of the 
weight of green vetch produced per acre, 
it appears to make little or no dilTerence 
whether the vetch is removed for hay 
or turned under, since vetch yields were

practically the same under both condi- 
tions. 

When 500 pounds of 0-8-4 fertilizer 
was applied under vetch and no fertilizer 
was applied to the following crop of cot- 
ton, the 7-ycar average green-weight yield 
of vetch from the plot cut for hay was 
4,710 pounds, while the yield of the vetch 
turned was 4,811 pounds. The yield of 
cotton following vetch removed for hay 
was 953 pounds of seed cotton, whereas 
the yield of cotton following the crop 
of vetch turned under was 1,068 pounds. 
The yields of unfertilized cotton follow- 
ing fertilized vetch removed for hay re- 
sulted in a loss of 115 pounds of seed 
cotton per acre. Results are shown in 
table 7. 

It is clear from the foregoing that on 
this soil, vetch produced for the purpose 
of increasing cotton production is more 
efliciently utilized when the entire crop 
is turned under than when the hay is 
removed and only the roots and stubble 
are turned under. However, the value of 
vetch used for hay can not be overlooked, 
and in some instances it may be of equal 
or greater value as feed. A fuller dis- 
cussion of economic factors involved is 



included in the discussion of the similar 
test on sandy loam soil. 
Fertilizer Applied to Vetch or to Cotton 
Since under the conditions of this test, 
the fertilization of both cotton and vetch 
is to be considered, the question natural- 
ly arises: Should required amounts of 
fertilizers be applied to vetch or to cot- 
ton? The results indicate a slight ad- 
vantage in the application of the ferti- 
lizer directly to the vetch for best vetch 
production, whether turned or removed 
for hay; but whether the fertilizers were 
applied to vetch or to cotton had but 
little efTect on the production of cotton 
following vetch removed for hay or 
turned. 

In the comparison in which vetch was 
removed for hay, where the vetch was 
fertilized and the cotton unfertilized, the 
succeeding crop of cotton yielded 953 
pounds of seed cotton per acre. Where 
the vetch was unfertilized and the suc- 
ceeding crop of cotton was fertilized, the 
yield of cotton was 915 pounds, an in- 
crease of 38 pounds. It is doubtful that

lized vetch crop yielded 1,068 pounds of 
seed cotton per acre; whereas fertiUzed 
cotton following unfertilized vetch yield- 
ed 1,108 pounds. This slight advantage 
in favor of direct application of the fer- 
tilizer to the cotton following turned 
vetch is similarly of doubtful significance. 
Data shown in table 7, 

Commercial Nitrogen Applied to Cotton 
Following Vetch Removed for Hay 

When vetch is grown for the purpose 
of increasing cotton production, it is more 
efficiently utilized when the entire crop 
is turned than when the hay is removed 
and only the roots and stubble are turn- 
ed under. However, economic factors 
may enter into the picture on many farms. 
The value of vetch hay can not be over- 
looked, and the farmer is justified in 
asking, Can I aflord to use the vetch 
tops as hay and keep cotton yields at 
high levels by applying required amounts 
of commercial nitrogen to the cotton 
crop.f^ 



The results (table 8) show little or no 
difference in cotton production follow- 
ing fertilized vetch removed for hay or 
turned under, when the cotton follow- 
ing removed vetch received commercial 
nitrogen. However, commercial nitrogen 
applied to cotton following unfertilized 
vetch removed for hay showed a sub- 
sinntial increase. 

One hundred pounds of nitrate of 
soda per acre applied to cotton following 
feriilized vetch removed for hay, pro- 
duced a 6-year average yield of 1,079 
pounds of seed cotton per acre, whereas 
cotton following fertilized turned vetch 
(no commercial nitrogen) yielded 1,068 
pounds. In these comparisons the same 
amount of vetch was removed for hay 
as that turned under, being approximate- 
ly 4,800 pounds of green vetch per acre 
in each case. 

Cotton fertilized with 500 pounds of 
5-8-4 fertilizer per acre following the 
removal of approximately 3,000 pounds 
unfertilized green vetch for hay, yielded

1,131 pounds of seed cotton per acre. 
Cotton fertilized with 500 pounds 0-8-4 
per acre (no additional nitrogen) follow- 
ing the removal of approximately the 
same amount of green vetch, yielded 915 
pounds. This is an increase of 216 
pounds attributable to the application of 
nitrogen after the vetch tops had been 
removed for hay. 

The Application of Lime in Addition to 
Phosphorus and Potash 

In one of the comparisons made in 
the test, 500 pounds of lime was applied 
in addition to the application of 500 
pounds 0-8-4 fertihzer under vetch. The 
7-year average vetch yield following this 
treatment was 6,849 pounds of green 
vetch per acre, the highest yield of green 
vetch in the test. Unfertilized cotton 
following this 6,849 pounds of turned 
vetch, yield 1,221 pounds of seed cot- 
ton per acre, which was the highest cot- 
ton yield in the vetch series, except one 
treatment that produced 10 pounds more 
seed cotton per acre. 

Vetch fertilized with 500 pounds of 
0-8-4 fertilizer and no lime produced 4,811 
pounds of green vetch per acre, and un- 
fertilized cotton following this amount 
of turned vetch, yielded 1,068 pounds, an 



increase of 153 pounds of seed cotton per 
acre attributable to the 500-pound lime 
treatment. These results are shown in 
table 9. 

The Value of Basic Slag 

The application of 500 pounds per 
acre of basic slag under vetch resulted 
in the production of 5,842 pounds of 
green vetch. The following crops of un- 
fertilized cotton yielded 1,172 pounds of 
seed cotton. 

The split application of basic slag, in 
which 250 pounds of 0-8-0 (basic slag) 
was applied under vetch and 250 addi- 
tional pounds applied under the succeed- 
ing crop of cotton, showed no appre- 
ciable benefits to vetch or cotton. The 
7-year average yield of vetch was 5,779 
pounds of green vetch when half the 
basic slag was applied to vetch and half 
to cotton, as compared to 5,842 pounds 
for the application of 500 pounds of 0-8-0 
(basic slag) applied to vetch. Cotton 
fertilized with 250 pounds of 0-8-0 (basic 
slag) per acre and following turned vetch 
that had received 250 pounds of 0-8-0 
(basic slag) per acre, yielded 1,231 
pounds of seed cotton per acre; this was 
the highest cotton yield in the vetch 
series.

Basic slag contains approximately 10 
percent of P-Or. and approximately 50 per- 
cent lime. It contains no potash. The 
results obtained from the use of basic 
slag are similar to those obtained from 
0-8-4 fertilizer plus lime, in that the 
highest vetch and cotton yields were ob- 
tained following the phosphate-plus-lime 
treatments in the vetch series. Results 
are shown in table 10. 

Other tests have shown that this soil 
is fairly well supplied with potash. 

Complete Fertilizer Applied to Cotton 

The highest 6-year average yield in the 
test was made when 500 pounds of 6-8-4 
fertilizer per acre was applied to cotton 
and no vetch was employed. 

This treatment yielded 1,321 pounds 
of seed cotton per acre, compared with 
787 pounds seed cotton from the no- 
vetch, no-fertilizer plots; and to 1,108 
pounds seed cotton when 500 pounds 
0-8-4 was applied to cotton following un- 
fertilized vetch. The results show an in- 
crease attributable to complete fertilizer 
of 534 pounds seed cotton per acre over 
the no-vetch, no-fertilizer plot, and of 
213 pounds seed cotton per acre over the 
vetch nitrogen plot (table 11). 



Relation of Cotton Yields to Vetch Yields 

It has been generally accepted during 
recent years that a good crop of vetch is 
approximately 6,000 pounds of green ma- 
terial per acre, and that such a yield of 
vetch turned imder would supply suflici- 
eent nitrogen to enable approximately the 
maximum production in the following 
crop of cotton. A comparison of vetch 
yields with yields of following crops of 
cotton, shown in tables 1 and 7, gives 
scant information on the relationship be- 
tween the amount of vetch turned under 
and the amount of cotton produced in 
the following crop. 

On Savannah fine sandy loam soil, 
vetch fertilized with 500 pounds of 0-8-4 
fertilizer produced a 7-year average yield 
of 5,533 pounds of green vetch per acre, 
and was followed by unfertilized cotton 
that yielded 953 pounds seed cotton; 
whereas, fertilized cotton following 4,227 
pounds of unfertilized green vetch per 
acre produced 1,027 pounds of seed cot- 
ton. This difference is perhaps due to 
the fertilizer being applied directly to 
the cotton rather than to the vetch and in- 
dicates that a direct application of the fer- 
tilizer to the cotton is of more value to the 
cotton crop than its application to vetch.

On Grenada silt loam soil a 7-year 
average yield of 4,811 pounds of ferti- 
lized vetch was turned under, and un- 
fertilized cotton following this vetch 
yielded 1,068 pounds of seed cotton per 
acre; whereas, fertilized cotton following 
3,657 pounds of green vetch per acre 
yielded 1,108 pounds of seed cotton. Here 
again, the lowest yields of vetch was 
followed hy the highest yields of cotton, 
which is also perhaps due to the direct 
application of the fertilizer to the cot- 
ton crop rather than to the vetch crop. 

Summary of Experiments Conducted on 
Grenada Silt Loam Soils 

Grenada silt loam soil was used for 
che cotton and vetch production studies 
made at the Holly Springs Branch Ex- 
periment Station, Holly Springs, Missis- 
sippi. Grenada silt loam is of Brown 
loam origin, and is a fairly productive 
soil even without fertilizer. However, 
most crops respond to applied fertilizers 
and in most cases good yields are ob- 
tained. 

From the above mentioned studies 
during the 6-year and 7-year period, the 
results seems to indicate the following: 

1. In order to produce cotton more 
profitably on this soil, annual applica- 
tions of phosphorus and lime are re- 



quired, whether supplied in a legume 
soil improvement program or whether by 
the addition of sufficient amounts of 
complete fertilizers. 

2. Fertilized cotton following unferti- 
lized vetch turned under, yielded slightly 
more seed cotton per acre than did un- 
fertilized cotton following fertiHzed vetch 
turned under. 

3. The removal of fertilized vetch for 
hay depressed cotton yields 115 pounds 
of seed cotton per acre, whereas the re- 
moval of unfertilized vetch for hay de- 
pressed cotton yields 193 pounds. 

4. When a 7-year average yield of 
4,818 pounds of fertilized vetch per acre 
was removed for hay and followed by 
cotton that had been fertilized with 100 
pounds of nitrate of soda per acre, cot- 
ton yields were slightly better than those 
obtained following approximately the 
amount of vetch turned under, but with- 
out the aid of commercial nitrogen. 

When 7-year average yields of 3,085 
pounds and 3,178 pounds of unfertilized 
vetch, respectively, were removed for hay, 
and followed by cotton fertilized with 
500 pounds of 3-8-4 fertilizer and 500 
pounds of 0-8-4 fertilizer per acre, the 
cotton yields were 1,131 pounds and 915 
pounds, respectively. This is an increase 



18 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 436 



of 216 pounds seed cotton in favor of 
the added nitrogen. 

5. The treatment using 500 pounds of 
0-8-4 fertihzer plus 500 pounds of lime 
produced a 7-year average yield of 6,849 
pounds of green vetch per acre, the high- 
est yield in the test. Unfertilized cotton 
following this treatment and this amount 
of vetch turned under yielded 1,221 
pounds of seed cotton per acre, as com- 
pared to 1,068 pounds for unfertilized 
cotton following turned vetch that had 
been fertilized with 500 pounds 0-8-4 
fertilizer and no lime. An increase of 
153 pounds of seed cotton per acre fol- 
lowing the lime treatment. 

6. The 500 pounds of 0-8-0 (basic 
slag) treatment applied to vetch produced 
a 7-year average yield of 5,842 pounds of 



green vetch per acre, the second highest 
yield in the experiment. Unfertilized cot- 
ton following this treatment and this 
amount of vetch turned under yielded 
1,172 pounds of seed cotton per acre, as 
compared to 1,231 pounds that was pro- 
duced following the split application of 
basic slag and with approximately the 
same amount of vetch turned under. 

7. The treatment using 500 pounds 
of 6-8-4 fertilizer (no vetch) produced a 
6-year average yield of 1,321 pounds of 
seed cotton per acre, whereas the 0-8-4 
fertilizer plus vetch nitrogen yielded 1,108 
pounds, and the no-vetch and no-ferti- 
lizer plat yielded 787 pounds. An in- 
crease of 213 pounds seed cotton for com- 
mercial nitrogen over vetch nitrogen and 
534 pounds over no-vetch, no-fertilizer.

THE RELATION OF SOIL FERTIUTY 

To 

HUMAN NUTRITION 



By 

OLIVE SHEETS 



MISSISSIPPI STATE COLLEGE

STATE COLLEGE MISSISSIPPI 



SUMMARY 



Experimental evidence is lacking which 
would support the belief that plant and 
animal foods produced in deficient soil 
areas have a lower nutritive value than 
the same foods produced on fertile soil. 
Few animal experiments and no experi 
ments on humans have been undertaken 
which give information on this subject. 

The great majority of the experiments 
showing the effects of soil fertility on 
the nutritive value of foods have been 
made on plants. 

Many factors affect the nutritive value 
of plants. These include the nature and 
composition of the soil, fertilizer treat- 
ments, variety of the plant, climate, and 
weather conditions. Studies have shown 
that of these factors, variety and climatic 
conditions may have a greater effect on 
the nutrients in the plant than soil fer- 
tility. Light has been found to have a 
marked influence on vitamin C forma- 
tion. 



A number of experiments have been 
cited which show that well grown plants 
from fertilized soil may under certain 
conditions have a lower content of sev- 
eral nutrients than poorly grown plants. 
Thus, turnip greens fertilized with ni- 
trogen gave a higher yield but contain- 
ed less calcium, phosphorus, iron, and 
vitamin C than plants produced from the 
same seed on unfertilized soil. 

Hay grown on phosphorus deficient 
soil, was found by one group of investiga- 
tors to be as digestible and to produce as 
good growth in animals as hay grown on 
the same soil fertilized with phosphorus. 

The poor nutritive conditions found 
among people living in poor soil areas 
seem to be directly related to the unpro- 
ductivity of the soil and the resulting pov- 
erty of the people. They do not produce 
enough food of the right kinds for an 
adequate diet, and because of low incomes, 
they do not purchase it. 



The Relation of Soil Fertility to Human 

Nutrition 

By OLIVE SHEETS 



No one would question the fact that 
a most fundamental relationship exists 
between the fertility of the soil and the 
diet of people. The importance to human 
welfare of conserving and increasing the 
fertility of the soil can hardly be over- 
emphasized. 

It is commonly assumed, however, that 
the relationship between soil and human 
nutrition is a direct one. As one writer 
has expressed it, "If the soil does not have 
it in it, the plants and animals that 
grow there do not, or the people who 
eat these plants and animals." To many 
people this means that a person may eat 
all of the recommended foods in suffi- 
cient amounts, yet his diet will still be 
inadequate if the foods have been pro- 
duced on deficient soil. 

A statement expressing this view may 
be quoted from a popular leaflet. The 
author states that a "good diet," that 
is, one recommended by a recognized 
authority "is not enough." He goes on 
to say, "Theoretically, such a diet should 
meet all your bodily requirements. Ac- 
tually, however, it cannot meet these re- 
quirements unless the food has been pro- 
duced on completely fertile soil. Thus, 
a person could consume in excess of the 
recommended quantities of all the foods 
listed in such a "health diet" if they came 
from deficient soils and still fail by a 
wide margin of supplying all the min- 
erals and vitamins which he requires for 
maintenance of health." 

Such beliefs are based upon the follow- 
ing evidence: (1) It has been observed 
for many years that livestock produced in 
certain poor soil areas in the United 
States and other parts of the world suf- 
fer from nutritional diseases. Further 
study has shown that there were mineral 
deficiencies in the soil and in the forage. 



(2) Humans also suffer from nutrition- 
al diseases which seem to be the direct 
result of soil deficiencies. 

If this evidence is carefully examined, 
we find that while nutritional diseases of 
animals, such as anemia, goiter, and bone 
diseases, may be traced to the lack of 
specific soil constituents, only goiter in 
humans can be so traced. This disease 
both in animals and man develops in 
areas where the plants and water lack 
iodine, indicating a soil deficiency in 
available iodine. 

Statements assuming a direct relation- 
ship between plant, animal, and human 
nutrition are impressive. They have 
great popular appeal in pointing out the 
importance of good agricultural practices 
and soil improvement to the health and 
welfare of rural people. 

To establish the truth of such state- 
ments, however, scientific evidence is 
necessary. This evidence can come only 
from many carefully controlled experi- 
ments. These experiments would have 
to prove that plants grown on poor soils 
have a lower nutritive value than the 
same varieties of plants grown on good 
soil. They would have to prove that 
animal foods produced in poor soil areas 
are deficient in nutrients as compared 
with those produced in good soil areas. 
It would be necessary for the animals 
from which the animal foods in the two 
areas were obtained to eat the same kinds 
of food in about the same amounts. 

Finally, the experiments would have 
to prove that groups of people living in 
poor soil areas suffer from nutritional 
deficiencies not found among comparable 
groups living in good soil areas when 
both groups eat the same kniJs and 
amounis of locally grown foods. In both 
the animal and human studies, careful 



4 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 437 



analysis would have to be made of all 
foods eaten and the nutritional condition 
of the animals and human subjects de- 
termined. 

Not many studies have been made of 
the kind described in the foregoing list 
of experiments. Of these, nearly all relate to 
the nutritive value of plants as mfluenced 
by soil fertility. Very few relate to ani- 
mal studies and no studies of the kind 
described have been made on humans. 

Some information, however, is avail- 
able which indicates the relation of soil 
fertility to human nutrition. In this bul- 
letin an attempt will be made to sum- 
marize studies giving such information, 
under the following headings: 

1. Studies showing the effect of soil 
fertility, including fertilizer treatment, 
and other factors on the nutritive value 
of plants. 

2. Animal feeding experiments. 

3. Human dietary studies. 

Studies Showing the Effect of 
Soil Fertility and Other Fac- 
tors on the Nutritive Value 
of Plants 

There are many factors which influ- 
ence the nutritive composition of plants. 
Among them are soil, fertilizers, climate 
or weather conditions, and species or va- 
rieties. These factors are interrelated. 
Thus, the addition of one or more soil 
nutrients affects the absorption of others. 
Also, weather conditions, such as rain- 
fall, temperature, and light, have an im 
portant effect upon the nutrients taken 
up by the plant and the way in which 
they are utilized. As a consequence, the 
same varieties grown on the same soil 
will vary in composition from season to 
season and from year to year. 

Because of great variations in the na 
ture and composition of soils and the 
influence which the other factors men- 
tioned have upon soil and the uptake of 
its nutrients by plants, it is not surpris- 
ing that the results of independent stu- 



dies are often conflicting. 

In this paper, studies in which the 
Mississippi Experiment Station partici- 
pated will be described, and the results 
of other studies summarized. An attempt 
will be made to bring out some of the 
most important findings which relate to 
the effect of soil, fertilizer, and other fac- 
tors on the mineral and vitamin content 
of plants.

Cooperative Experiments on Turnip 
Greens 

Cooperative studies were made by a 
group of workers in several southern 
experiment stations, in which the depart- 
ments of Home Economics, Chemistry, and 
Horticulture of the Mississippi Experiment 
Station participated. Extensive field ex- 
periments were carried out on turnip 
greens and cowpeas.^ ~ ^ 

The effects of fertilizer, soil composi- 
tion, and certain climatic conditions on 
the calcium, phosphorus, and iron con- 
tent of turnip greens were studied. One 
variety of greens (Seven Top) from the 
same lot of seed, and with the same ferti- 
lizer treatments, was grown in 19 local- 
ities in six southern states during suc- 
cessive seasons. 

A total of 30 crops were produced, each 
being one experiment. A factorial de- 
sign was used for the experiments; that 
is, one which included all combinations 
of several different sets of treatments or 
"factors." There were 16 fertilizer treat- 
ments with two replications for each 
treatment, so that there were 32 plots for 
each experiment. Nitrogen (N), calcium 
(Ca), phosphorus (P), and potassium 
(K) were added singly and in all com- 
binations. The low level for each of the 
four nutrients was a check plot consisting 
of the natural untreated soil. The 16 
fertilizer treatments were as follows: 
NPKCa, NPK, NPCa, NP, NKCa, NK, 
NCa, N, PKCa, PK, PCa, P, KCa, K, 
Ca and check. 

The quantities of fertilizer used were

*The iron data were averages of two experiments in Virginia. 



60 pounds per acre of N from ammon- 
ium sulfate, 60 pounds per acre of P2OB 
from triple superphosphate, 60 pounds per 
acre of K2O from muriate of potash, and 
120 pounds per acre of Ca from gymsum. 
In all localities a relatively poor soil was 
selected in order to study the effects of 
the fertilizer treatments. The majority 
of the soils were deficient in both nitro- 
gen and phosphorus, and about one third 
of them were deficient in calcium. The 
greens from every experiment were har- 
vested at a mature stage, and samples 
were analyzed from each of the 32 plots 
constituting one experiment. Samples of 
the soil were also analyzed. Yield rec- 
ords were taken from 13 experiments. 

Effects of fertilizer treatments. The 

data from all experiments were combin- 
ed and analyzed statistically. Twenty- 
nine of the 30 experiments were includ- 
ed in the results on calcium and phos- 
phorus and 28 experiments in the results 
on iron, because of incomplete data from 
the experiments which were omitted. The 
average effects of the four fertilizer fac- 
tors, N, P, K, and Ca on the calcium, 



phosphorus, and iron content of the 
greens are shown in table 1. By means 
of the statistical analysis, it was possible 
to determine the effects of each of the 
factors whether each was added singly or 
in combination with one or more of the 
other three factors. For example, in each 
experiment there were 16 plots to which 
nitrogen was added out of a total of 32 
plots. The total number of plots for ni- 
trogen in 29 experiments would there- 
fore be 16x29, or 464 plots. 

Of the four fertilizer factors studied, the 
application of nitrogen had the greatest 
effect on the mineral content of the 
greens. It decreased the calcium in 28 
out of 29 experiments, and the iron in 
26 out of 28 experiments. This decrease 
was statistically significant for calcium 
in 24 experiments, and for iron in 14 ex- 
periments. 

When results are statistically significant 
there is little probability that they are due 
to mere chance. Nitrogen also reduced 
the phosphorus content of the greens in 
18 experiments, the reduction being signi- 
ficant in 12 of them. The effect of nitro-

gen on the phosphorus in the greens was, 
however, less consistent than its effect 
on calcium and iron, as there were six 
experiments in which it increased the 
phosphorus. 

Phosphorus, when apphed to the soil, 
increased the phosphorus content of the 
greens in 27 out of 29 experiments, 
and significantly in 18 of them. There 
was an over-all tendency, however, for 
applied phosphorus to decrease both the 
calcium and the iron in the greens, al- 
though its effects varied in different 
localities and in different seasons. 

The addition of calcium to the soil in- 
creased the calcium content of the greens 
in 20 experiments, but significantly in 
only four of them. Calcium also tend- 
ed to increase the phosphorus, but the 
increase was significant in only three ex- 
periments. Calcium had no significant 
effect on the iron in the greens. 

The effects of adding potassium varied 
with the experiment and were not consis- 
tent. 

In the 13 experiments in which yield 
records were taken, nitrogen had the 
greatest effect, increasing the yield in 
8 of the the 13 experiments. 

In most instances, as will be seen from 
table I, the effects of the fertilizer treat- 
ments were relatively small, and therefore 
could not be regarded as important from 
a dietary standpoint. The largest ef- 
fects for minerals were those of nitrogen 
on the calcium, phosphorus, and iron 
in the greens, calcium and iron being 
reduced significantly. The actual reduc- 
tion averaged about 12 percent of the 
calcium, 18 percent of the iron, and 1.1 
percent of the phosphoru?^ found in the 
greens from the check plots. Nitrogen 
had an important effect on yield, increas- 
ing it 72.71 grams (lYz ounces) per foot 
of row. This was an increase of more 
than 50 percent over the average yield 
from the check plots. 

It would seem that the increase in yield 
caused by nitrogen might account for 



the decrease which it produced in the 
mineral content, since the minerals tak- 
en up by the plant would be distributed 
in a greater quantity of plant tissue. The 
statistical analysis indicated that this was 
the case. 

In view of the fact that most of the 
soils upon which the greens were grown 
were deficient in nitrogen and phos- 
phorus, and some of them in calcium, 
it is interesting to compare the mineral 
content of the greens from the plots to 
which all four fertilizer factors were 
added, with the mineral content of the 
greens from the plots which received 
no fertilizer. The results for the aver- 
age calcium, phosphorus, and iron con- 
tent of the turnip greens from the 
N'PKCa and check plots, for each sta- 
tion and for the 30 experiments, are giv- 
en in table 2. 

It will be seen that the greens from 
the check plots contained more calcium 
at every station than those from the 
NPKCa plots. The same was true for 
iron with the exception of the Texas plots. 
The check plots contained less phos- 
phorus, however, than the NPKCa plots. 
Averaging all experiments, the greens from 
the check plots contained 13.7 percent 
more calcium, 28.8 percent more iron, and 
8.2 percent less phosphorus than the 
greens from NPKCa plots. Thus the 
average effect of increasing the fertility 
of the soil by the addition of four ferti- 
lizer factors, two of which were known 
to be deficient in the majority of the 
soils, was an actual decrease in the nu- 
tritive value of the greens with respect 
to calcium and iron, and only a small 
increase in phosphorus. 

Effects of soil constituents. The ques- 
tion arises as to the effects of the soil 
constituents in the original soil on the 
mineral content of the greens, and the 
ways in which the fertilizer treatments 
might modify these effects. In order 
that this question might be studied, the 
soils were analyzed before fertilizer was 
added. They were classified into low, 



THE RELATION OF SOIL FERTILITY TO HOME NUTRITION 



9 



medium, and high with respect to their 
content of three important soil constitu- 
ents, namely, calcium, phosphorus, and 
organic matter. Using this classification, 
the data from the check as well as from 
the fertilized plots were studied, and the 
average effects of the soil constituents 
determined. The results on the check 
plots were as follows: 

It was found that the calcium in the 
greens increased as the soil calcium in- 
creased. The same was also true for 
phosphorus. Organic matter had little 
effect on calcium and phosphorus, but 
did have an important effect upon the 
iron content of the greens. The iron in- 
creased with increased organic matter. 
The greens grown on the high organic 
matter soils averaged over two and a half 
times as much iron as those grown on the 
low organic matter soils. Neither soil, 
calcium, or phosphorus affected the iron 
in the greens. 

It should be kept in mind, however, 
that the results just described were ob- 
tained on the unfertilized plots. Since 
the majority of the soils were poor, ferti- 
lizers would have been added, particularly 
nitrogen, if good agricultural practices 
were followed. 

The results on the fertilized plots were 
similar to those obtained on the same 
plots for the 29 unclassified soils. 
Nitrogen again had the most marked 
effect, decreasing the calcium, phosphorus, 
and iron in the greens. This occurred 
at all three levels of the soil constituents 
for calcium and iron, but nitrogen de- 
creased phosphorus only in the low phos- 
phorus soils, of which there were 22. In 
general, soil constituents had a greater 
effect on the minerals studied than did 
the added fertilizers. It should be point- 
ed out, however, that with regard to cal- 
cium and phosphorus, this may have 
been due to the difference in the soil 
levels of these two minerals as compared 
with the amounts in the fertilizer. For 
example, the differences in the high and 



low calcium soils amounted to about 2,000 
pounds per acre, as compared with 120 
pounds added as fertilizer. 

Effects of climatic conditions. In field 
studies it was not possible to separate the 
effects of the various factors associated 
with climate and weather, such as tem- 
perature, light, humidity, and rainfall. 
It was possible, however, to study sea- 
sonal and yearly differences in the min- 
eral content of greens grown at the same 
place, since they were grown on the same 
kind of soil, and received the same ferti- 
lizer treatments. The largest differences 
were in iron content. 

Table 3 shows the average percent of 
iron in the greens from N, P, K, Ca, and 
check plots, in which the seasonal or year- 
ly difference in greens grown at the same 
place was 50 percent or more. These 
plots were selected, since the effects of 
a combination of fertilizer factors added 
to the soil did not enter into the varia- 
tion, as would have been the case if 
more than one factor had been added. It 
will be seen that in some instances the 
seasonal variation was greater than that 
between places, and that the spring greens 
contained about twice as much iron as 
the fall greens. A comparison of the 
average iron content of the spring and 
fall crops in 29 experiments disclosed 
that of the 14 crops having the higher 
iron content, only one was grown in 
the fall. However, the study did not 
extend over a long enough period and 
the data were insufficient to obtain con- 
clusive results. While the data were in- 
sufficient to make a complete study of 
the effects of season on mineral content, 
they indicate that variations due to sea- 
son or climate might more than offset 
variations due to soil. 

The effect of place. By far the great- 
est differences found in the mineral con- 
tent of the greens were associated with 
the place where they were grown. This 
is brought out in figures 1, 2, and 3. 
Figure 1 shows the average calcium.

figure 2 the average phosphorus content 
of the greens in each of the 30 crops, 
and figure 3 shows the average iron con- 
tent in each of 29 crops, for all fertilizer 
treatments. 

The greatest variation occurred in the 
iron, and the least variation in the phos- 
phorus content. The range for the av- 
erage percent of calcium in the 30 crops 
was 1.74 percent at Sandhill, South Caro- 
line, to 5.08 percent at West Point, Mis- 
sissippi, and the range for phosphorus 
from .3531 percent at West Point, Mis- 
sissippi, to .7203 percent at Stoneville, 
Mississippi. The iron content in each 
of the 29 crops varied from .01052 percent 
at West Point to .05985 percent at Blairs- 
ville, Georgia. 

It seemed that variations in yield be- 
tween different places might account for 
the variations in the mineral content of 
the greens. A statistical analysis of the 
data showed, however, that this was not 
the case. 

In comparing the Ca, P, and Fe content 
of the greens from the different places, 
it will be noted that greens which were 
high in one mineral might be low in one 
or both of the other two minerals. The 
most outstanding example of this was 
the West Point greens. The greens from 
Blairsville and Blacksburg, however, were 
exceptionally high in iron and a little 
above average in calcium and phosphorus.

It is evident from the experiments on 
turnip greens that there were many fac- 
tors responsible for the large variation 
in the mineral content of the greens grown 
in different places. Soil composition is 
only one of these factors, and in many 
instances may have had less influence 
than a combination of other factors. 
Mississippi Studies on Leafy 
Vegetables 

Studies were made on several vegetables 
by the Home Economics Department of 
the Mississippi Experiment Station, most 
of them previous to the cooperative stu- 
dies. While these studies were prelimi- 
nary in nature, the results seem worth re- 
porting in view of the results obtained 
from the cooperative studies. 

Experiments on mustard and turnip 
greens. Mustard and turnip greens from 
the same lots of seed were grown at three 
branch stations in Mississippi in the 
spring of 1928. The greens were to be 
harvested at 7, 8, and 9 weeks after the 
planting dates, but all three harvests were 
made only at Poplarville (tab'e 4). All 
lots of greens were analyzed for iron. 
Yield records were not taken, but the 
condition and growth of the plants were 
carefully noted. Table 4 shows the iron 
content of the greens harvested at 7, 8 
and 9 weeks, for all samples which were 
secured. It will be noted that the poor- 
ly grown greens from Stoneville and

Raymond had a higher iron content than 
the well grown greens at Poplarville. 

The soil analysis indicates that both 
the Stoneville and Raymond soils, par- 
ticularly the former, were more fertile 
than the Poplarville soil (table 5), yet 
the Poplarville greens were succulent and 
of excellent quality in contrast to the 
greens from Stoneville and Raymond, 
which v/ere stunted and tough. Informa- 
tion on rainfall was not obtained and it 
may have been an important factor influ- 
encing the growth of the plants. The 
results show, however, that potentially fer- 
tile soils may produce inferior vegetables, 
while much poorer soils may produce su- 
perior vegetables with respect to eating 
qualities. They also show that a well 
grown vegetable may be inferior in nu- 
tritive value, at least with regard to iron, 
to a poorly grown vetgetable. The growth 
of a vegetable is, therefore, not necessarily 
a criterion of its nutritive value. 

Experiments on spinach and tender- 
greens. Nitrogen fertilizer experiments 
on spinach and on tendergreens were 
carried out on the same soil in the spring, 
but in different years, by the Horticul- 
ture Department. Soil analysis as well as 
the growth of crops in the same place in 
previous years had demonstrated that the 
soil was fairly fertile. It was not deficient 



in available minerals, including calcium, 
phosphorus, potassium, and manganese, 
although the addition of nitrogen improv- 
ed production considerably in the early 
spring crops because the low soil tempera- 
tures made the nitrogen less available to 
the plants. 

The Home Economics Department was 
interested in the effect of the nitrogen 
on the mineral content of the greens, so 
samples of the vegetables were taken for 
analysis from the high nitrogen and the 
check plots. The samples were analyzed 
for calcium, phosphorus, iron, and nitro- 
gen. The results of the analyses are 
shown in table 6. The data on nitrogen 
are included, since it was thought the re- 
sults might be of interest. 

In all three experiments, although the 
vegetables were grown in different years, 
the plants from the plots which 
received no nitrogen contained more 
calcium, phosphorus, and iron than 
those from the high nitrogen plots. With 
respect to nitrogen, the differences between 
the no nitrogen and high nitrogen plots 
were very small in two experiments, al- 
though it is the general observation that 
the application of nitrogen increases the 
nitrogen content of plants. Data on yield 
were secured only from the experiment 
on tendergreens. The yield from the high 



THE RELATION OF SOIL FERTILITY TO HOME NUTRITION 



13 



nitrogen plots was nearly ten times that 
from the no nitrogen plots. Yield differ- 
ences between the high nitrogen and 
check plots in the two experiments on 
spinach would doubtless have been even 
greater, since there was a greater differ- 
ence in the sizes of the plants from the 
two plots. 

In these experiments on spinach and 
tendergreens the effects of the applica- 
tion of nitrogen on calcium and iron 
content and upon yield are in accordance 
with the results obtained in the coopera- 
tive experiments on turnip greens. They 
also give further evidence that poorly 
grown plants may have a higher mineral 
content than well grown plants. 

Studies on Cowpeas 

A study similar to that on turnip greens 
was conducted on cowpeas.^ Peas of the 
same variety (Cream Crowder) and from 
the same seed source were grown in 22 
locations in five of the six states where 
the turnip greens were grown. The 
places of the experiments and the ferti- 
lizer treatments were the same as those 
for turnip greens. 

A study of the average calcium, phos- 
phorus, and iron content of the cowpeas 
from each experiment showed much less 
variation in mineral content than was 
found for turnip greens. The range in 
calcium content was .063 to .100 per 
cent; in phosphorus content, .367 to .590 
percent; and in iron content, .0040 to 
.0079 percent. As in turnip greens, iron 
showed the greatest variation. 

The fertilizer treatments had less effect 
on the calcium and phosphorus content 
of cowpeas than on that of turnip greens. 
In eight out of the 21 experiments for 
which complete data were secured, the 
calcium and phosphorus in the cowpeas 
was neither increased or decreased signi- 
ficantly by the addition of fertilizer. 

Adding fertilizer to the soil affected 
the iron more than it did the calcium and 
phosphorus in the peas, since there were 
only four experiments in which no 



significant effects of fertilizer on iron 
were observed. 

The effects of fertilizer, however, vari- 
ed so much with the experiment and place 
where the cowpeas were grown that there 
were no outstanding effects of any one 
fertilizer treatment on mineral content, 
as was the case with turnip greens. Nitro- 
gen, however, decreased the calcium, phos- 
phorus, or iron content of the peas in 
more experiments than it increased them. 

Summary of Other Investigations 
On Minerals 

In a review of recent literature entitled, 
"The Effect of Mineral Supply on the 
Mineral Concentration and Nutritional 
Quality of Plants,"'* Beeson points out 
that very few studies in this field have 
been made on human foods. The ma- 
jority of such studies have dealt with for- 
age crops. Although in many instances 
the results were conflicting, Beeson was 
able to arrive at some general conclusions, 
most of which are included in the fol- 
lowing summary: 

1. The amounts of phosphorus in most 
forage plants can be increased slightly 
by the use of phosphate fertilizers. The 
evidence indicates that the effect of ap- 
plied phosphates on the phosphorus con- 
tent of plants is largely dependent on the 
nature of the soil. 

2. The effects of applied nitrogen on 
the phosphorus in the plant are variable. 

3. Adding calcium to the soil decreases 
plant phosphorus under some conditions 
and has no effect under others. This is 
probably due to the nature of the soil. 

4. In general, applied calcium in- 
creases the calcium in the plant, although

generally reduced the percentage of cal- 
cium in the plant. 

7. The number of soil experiments in 
which the effects of micronutrients (bo- 
ron, cobalt, copper, manganese, iron) 
have been studied are so few that no 
conclusions can be drawn as to their in- 
fluence on the composition of the plant. 

The effects of applied phosphorus, cal- 
cium, nitrogen, and potassium, as stated 
in the foregoing conclusions, agree on 
most points with the results of the co- 
operative experiments on turnip greens. 
Studies on Vitamins 

Many investigators have studied the ef- 
fects of fertilization and other factors on 
the vitamin content of plants. These 
studies have dealt chiefly with vitamin 
C and carotene, the form in which vit- 
amin A exists in plants. As in mineral 
studies, the findings have frequently been 
conflicting partly because different plants 
were studied, partly because the experi- 
ments were not carried out under the 
same conditions, and partly because all 
factors were not, or could not, be con- 
trolled. 

Cooperative Experiments. Three of the 
6 stations which cooperated in the study 
on the mineral content of turnip greens, 
made a study of vitamin C content as 
well.'' At these stations, the same samples 
were used for both mineral and vitamin 
studies. Samples were analyzed for vitamin 
C from four localities: two in Virginia, one 
in Georgia, and one in Oklahoma. Oif the 
four fertilizer factors. N. P, K, and Ca. 
only nitrogen and potassium had a sig- 
nificant average effect when data from 
the four places were combined. 

Although the average effect of nitrogen 
was to decrease the vitamin C content of 
the greens, there was a significant in- 
crease at one place. Potassium decreased 
the vitamin C in the greens in all four 
places and significantly in three of them. 
The greens were grown on different types 
of soil at the four places, but in this 
study no differences in vitamin C content 



could be attributed to the soil with the 
data which were available. 

As in the case of minerals, the greatest 
variation in vitamin C was associated with 
the place where the greens were grown. 
A study of weather conditions indicated 
that sunshine might have had an impor- 
tant effect on the vitamin C content of 
the greens, since those from the two ex- 
periments giving the highest content were 
produced during periods when there was 
the most clear weather. 

Experiments at the Mississippi Station. 
In field experiments on turnip greens 
harvested at 2-week intervals, considerable 
variation in the vitamin C content of the 
greens was observed for the different har- 
vests. As this variation did not seem to 
be due to plant maturity, it was thought 
that it might be explained by weather 
conditions, particularly with reference to 
light, since it is known that light has an 
important influence on the formation of 
vitamin C in plants. 

To study the effect of light under field 
conditions, an experiment was conduct- 
ed on another plot of turnip greens plant- 
ed in a row 2-3 feet wide. A 5-foot por- 
tion of the row where the growth of the 
greens was uniform was shaded with 
canvas for 4^2 days. At the end of this 
time samples of the shaded greens, as 
well as the unshaded greens just beyond 
each end of the shaded portion, were tak- 
en. The leaf blades were analyzed for 
vitamin C. 

Table 7 shows the results of this an- 
alysis. It will be noted that shading the 
greens with canvas for only 4^2 days 
caused considerable reduction in vitamin 
C content. The two samples of unshaded 
greens differed litde in the amount of 
vitamin C found, but averaged over 31 
percent more than the shaded greens. Dur- 
ing the 4V2 days of the experiment, the 
second day was partly cloudy and the 
other days were clear. The greens were 
harvested at 1:00 p. m. 
The experiment was conducted in No-

view of the Hterature, they cite other ex- 
periments in which the vitamin C con 
centration in unfertilized spinach and in 
tomatoes was higher than that in the fer- 
tilized vegetable, particularly when nitro- 
gen alone was used. Fertilization studies 
with apples and grapefruit have also given 
results similar to those on vegetables. The 
fruit from trees which were not fertilized 
or received a low supply of nitrogen had 
a higher concentration of vitamin C than 
fruit from the fertilized trees. 

Apparently, decreased growth of plants 
resulting from a variety of conditions may 
cause an increase in the concentration 
of vitamin C. This has been observed not 
only when there was a lack of nitrogen, 
but also when there was a lack of iron 
and magnesium. Decreased growth due 
to dry weather may also result in an in- 
crease in vitamin C in plants. A part of 
this increase, however, is due to sunshine. 

The effect of light intensity on the vit- 
amin C content of turnip greens has been 
studied.^ Turnip greens which had been 
grown in pots were placed in a special 
chamber and exposed 16 hours daily for 
one week to various light intensities. The 
intensities varied from 200 to 5,000 foot 
candles. The vitamin C content of the 
leaves increased as the light intensity in- 
creased. The greens which were exposed 
to an intensity of 200-foot candles con- 
tained 28.2 milligrams of vitamin C per 
100 milligrams of fresh weight while 
those which were exposed to a light in- 
tensity of 5,000-foot candles contained 
235.5 milligrams, or over eight times as 
much. This experiment shows that the 
intensity of light which varies with the 
climate, the season, and the kind of day 
is a very important factor influencing the 
vitamin C content of plants. 

The influence of variety or strain on 
the amount of vitamin C found in vege- 
tables and fruits has been studied by a 
number of investigators. While environ- 
ment or the place where the plant was 
grown had considerable effect on vitamin 



C content, the effect of variety was usu- 
ally greater than that of other factors re- 
lated to the environment such as climate 
or soil and fertilization. 

Carotene and Other Vitamins 

The cooperative experiments on turnip 
greens and those made at the Mississippi 
station did not include carotene and other 
vitamins, although experiments are in 
progress which do include them. A sum- 
mary of the results of other investigations 
will, therefore, be given. 

In a number of studies, some of them 
quite recent, fertilization with nitrogen 
has been found to increase the carotene 
content of the plants. Other studies, how- 
ever, report no effect on carotene from 
the use of nitrogen. The results of ex- 
periments in which various fertilizer 
treatments were tried indicated that ferti- 
lization had little effect on the amount 
of carotene in the plant. These experi- 
ments included extensive studies on to- 
matoes and turnip greens. 

Experiments in which boron was added 
to the soil have, however, given more con- 
sistent results. The application of boron 
has been found to increase the carotene 
content of plants grown on a boron- 
deficient soil. 

Some studies on tomatoes have been 
reported which indicate that light affects 
the carotene content of plants, as tomatoes 
grown in the green house had less caro- 
tene in them than tomatoes grown out 
of doors. 

As has been pointed out, the majority 
or vitamin studies have dealt with the 
effects of fertilization and other factors 
on the carotene and vitamin C content 
of plants. This is due to the fact that 
chemical methods for the determination 
of the other vitamins have been develop- 
ed more recently and the results of an- 
alysis are less rehable. 

Most of the studies on other vitamins 
have been made on cereals. The amounts 
of Bi (thiamine) in the same kinds of 
cereals have been found to vary with 



THE RELATION OF SOIL FERTILITY TO HOME NUTRITION 



17 



the variety and the place where they 
were grown, but this was not true of Bs 
(riboflavin). There is little evidence that 
fertilizers have an important effect upon 
either the Bi or the B2 content of wheat. 

The niacin (pellagra-preventing vita- 
min) content of foods is of particular 
interest in the South. Recent studies on 
corn varieties and strains indicate that 
variety may be one of the most important 
factors influencing the niacin content of 
cereals. 

Summary on Vitamins 

The vitamin content of plants is influ- 
enced by many factors which include va- 
riety and strain, soil and fertilizers, cli- 
mate and weather conditions. 

The results on the effects of fertilizers 
are conflicting but there is evidence that 
under some conditions they may have a 
significant effect upon the vitamin C 
and carotene content of plants. This is 
particularly true of nitrogen which in 
several studies has been found to decrease 
the amount of vitamin C but increase 
the amount of carotene. 

Factors affecting the growth of plants 
also affect the concentration of vitamin 
C. Stunted plants are apt to contain 
more vitamin C than well grown plants. 

Experiments have demonstrated that 
conditions associated with chmate and 
weather, particularly light intensity, have 
a very important effect on the vitamin 
C content of plants, and influence their 
carotene content. 

Studies have shown that variety and 
strain may have a greater influence on 
the vitamin C, Bi, and niacin present 
in foods of plant origin than the environ- 
ment in which they were produced. 

Discussion of the Relation of Soil 
Fertility and Other Factors to 
the Nutritive Value of Plants 

The estimation of the nutritive value of 
foods, including those of plant origin, is 
usually based upon their composition as 
determined by chemical analyses. This 



is due to the fact that biological tests (ani- 
mal feeding experiments where the food 
is fed under controlled conditions) are 
very time consuming, laborious, and ex- 
pensive, although the best means of in- 
vestigating the nutritive value of foods. It 
has been found that on the whole the 
results of chemical analysis agree fairly 
well with the results of biological tests. 
In this discussion, judgement as to the 
nutritive value of a food is based upon 
the results of chemical analyses. 

From the information which has been 
given concerning the influence of various 
factors on the mineral and vitamin con- 
tent of foods of plant origin, it is evi- 
dent that soil fertility is only one of many 
factors. It is also evident that the many 
factors working at the same time, and 
affecting each other make it very difficult 
to determine the actual effects of soil 
fertility on the nutritive value of foods. 
Extensive and very carefully controlled 
experiments are necessary and few of these 
have been made. It has been shown that 
factors other than soil, such as variety, 
and climatic or weather conditions may 
be more important than soil fertility in 
influencing the amount of certain nu- 
trients in plants. It cannot be said, there- 
fore, that the amounts of these nutrients 
depend upon soil fertility alone. 

It has also been shown that when soil 
fertility is improved by the addition of 
nitrogen and other fertilizer factors so 
that the plants make better growth, 
the concentration of certain nu- 
trients, such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, 
and vitamin C, may actually be reduced. 
Thus, poorly grown plants which are the 
result of soil deficiencies may have a 
higher nutritive value on the whole than 
well grown plants not suffering from 
these deficiencies. This does not support 
the common assumption that poor soil 
produces plants of lower nutritive value 
than good soil. 

It may be concluded that evidence is 
lacking to show that the nutritive value 



Mississippi AORICtJLTURAL EXPERIMI.NT STATION BULLETIN 437 



of plants is chiefly dependent upon soil 
fertility. 

Animal Feeding Experiments 

As Beeson points out, most animal feed- 
ing experiments in which the effects of 
pasture fertilization are studied show only 
the effects of pasture improvement result- 
ing from increased yield and the introduc- 
tion of more nutritious species of plants. 
The increase in production of animal 
products per acre is used to measure the 
effects of fertilization. No study is made 
to show how fertilization influences the 
nutritive value of the same kinds of 
plants. 

Studies in which biological tests were 
used to measure the effects of soil fer- 
tility have been reported by Albrecht and 
co-workers.^ ^ Animals (lambs and 
rabbits) were fed hay crops produced on 
soil fertilized with superphosphate and 
lime and their growth compared with that 
of animals fed hay from untreated soils. 
The animals fed the hay from the fer- 
tilized soil made the best growth. It 
was concluded that such hay was superior 
to that grown on the untreated soil, even 
though little difference was found in the 
chemical composition of the two hays 
when analyzed for nitrogen, calcium, and 
phosphorus. The assumption was that 
there were nutritional differences in the 
two hays not shown by the chemical an- 
alyses. The experiments of Albrecht and 
co-workers have been criticized in the 
following respects: 

1. In the earlier studies they failed to 
take into account possible variations in 
the kinds of plants present in the two 
hays. 

2. Although chemical analyses failed 
to show nutritional differences, no experi- 
ments were made to determine the di- 
gestibility of the two hays. 

3. The differences between the gains 
in weight of the two sets of animals were 
very small; and it was not demonstrated 
that this difference was statistically sig-

4, In some of the experiments only 
three animals were used, although a 
minimum of six to eight is usually regard- 
ed as necessary, since there is considerable 
variability in the way in which different 
animals respond to the same feed, even 
when they are carefully selected for uni- 
formity. 

Animal feeding experiments are also be- 
ing carried out by investigators at the U.S. 
Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory at 
Ithaca, New York, in connection with 
studies to determine the ettect of phos- 
phorus on the nutritive value of plants. 
Two sheep feeding experiments have 
been completed.' ' In the lirst one, two 
lots of Sudan grass hay produced on a 
low phosphorus soil in the same field 
fertilized with potash and nitrogen were 
tested for their nutritvie value. The two 
lots of hay differed only in that one lot 
had been fertilized with superphosphate 
in addition to potash and nitrogen. When 
the two lots were fed to lambs neither 
growth tests or digestion experiments in- 



THE RELATION OF SOIL FERTILITY TO HOME NUTRITION 



19 



dicated a difference in nutritive value. 
The second experiment in which Canada 
field peas w^ere fed led to similar results. 

The results of the Ithaca studies would 
seem to be contradictory to the observa- 
tions that livestock in poor soil areas de- 
velop nutritional diseases because the 
soil in lacking in certain minerals and, 
therefore, the plants which the animals 
eat. It may be pointed out, however, 
that the forage eaten by the Ithaca ani- 
mals differed in kind and amount from 
that which would be available to the ani- 
mals in poor soil areas. The nutritive 
value of species of plants which will grow 
in poor soil is naturally low, the amount 
produced may be limited, and such species 
may have a low digestibility. 

Human Dietary Studies 

Many dietary studies have been made 
among rural people which show that low 
or very low income families usually have 
a deficient diet. In some instances, the 
physical condition of the people has been 
correlated with the diet. In no instances, 
however, have careful studies been made 
accompanied by studies showing the nu- 
tritional condition of the people in which 
one group living in a deficient soil area 
was compared with a similar group living 
in a good soil area. 

Only one study has furnished definite 
information as to the kinds of food eaten 
by people living in different soil areas. 
This study entitled, "Family Living on 
Poorer and Better Soils," was made by 
the Home Economics Department of the 
Mississippi Station. ^- 

Records of menus served by 125 white 
families were kept for two days in Febru- 
ary, July, and November of one year. 
The foods were classified and the num- 
ber of times they were not served were 
tabulated for the families living on poorer 
soil and those living on better soil. The 
results are shown in table 8. 

The families living on poorer soils 
served milk, as well as meat and eggs, less 



often than those living on better soils. 
It was also found that families living on 
poorer soil produced less milk, meat, and 
other food than those living on better 
soils. Although dietary studies among 
the two types of families were not made, 
it may be inferred from the study of 
the menus and the food produced that 
the diets of the families living on poorer 
soil were inferior to those living on 
better soil. 

Relation of Soil Fertility To 
The Diet of Humans 

The scientific evidence now available 
does not confirm the belief that the nu- 
tritive value of the diet of humans living 
in deficient soil areas is direcdy related 
to the fertility of the soil. The locally 
produced foods which the people eat may 
be no less nutritious than the same kinds 
of food produced on fertile soil. The 
evidence which has been presented shows 
that this is true with regard to foods 
of plant origin. It is probably true also 
for foods of animal origin, although in- 
formation on this point is lacking. 

Experiments comparing the nutritive 
value of foods derived from poorly nour- 
ished animals with the nutritive value of 
the same kinds of foods derived from well 
nourished animals have not been made. 
It is known, however, that the composition 
of cows' milk with respect to fat protein, 
and mineral content is not greatly changed 
by the diet of the animal. 

It seems most probable, therefore, that 
people living in poor soil areas are poor- 
ly nourished, not because of deficiencies 
in the plant and animal foods produced 
there, but because these people do not 
produce enough foods of the right kind. 
Their diets are apt to include too little 
of the protective foods — meat, milk, eggs, 
fruit, and green vegetables. Dietary stu- 
dies dealing with poor rural people in- 
dicate this. Incomes are low, because of 
low production, and foods needed to 
supplement the diet are not purchased.

The Production and Utilization of Kudzu 



By R. E. O'BRIEN and D. W. SKELTON' 
INTRODUCTION 

Kudzu is reported to have been introduced into the United States from 
Japan in 1876. Being a perennial vine plant and having large leaves it 
was ideally suited for use on trellises to form a shade around homes. Its 
earlier popularity came from this use. Its value for erosion control and as 
a forage crop was not fully realized until rather recent years. During the 
past 30 years it has gained popularity rather rapidly and within the last 
15 years its use has become widespread in the Southeast. Owing to its ex- 
ceptional value for erosion control, it has been given great impetus by the 
Soil Conservation Service. 

The large amount of gullied land and sheet-eroded slopes on many 
Mississippi farms has created a critical need for a plant that will grow 
vigorously enough under somewhat unfavorable soil conditions to check 
the loss of soil. There are also few perennial legumes well adapted to 
southern conditions that offer promise for hay and forage production on 
moderately low fertility soils. 

Kudzu seems to fit remarkably well into these needs. In fact it has a 
number of qualifications that make it a valuable plant for many Missis- 
sippi farms. Its perennial nature offers certain advantages over the annual 
legumes. Being a vino that roots at the nodes gives it special merits for 
erosion control that can be found in few other plants. Its deep root system 
makes it more resistant to dry weather than most legumes. 

The abundant production of large palatable leaves, relished by all 
types of livestock, gives it the necessary qualifications for being a good hay 
or forage plant. As a hay crop it has the unique characteristic of not hav- 
ing a critical stage of growth for cutting as is true of most hay plants if the 
best quality hay is to be obtained. A further advantage is that it is seldom 
bothered by insects or diseases. 

The plant has one outstanding handicap, that has undoubtedly limited 
its use, in that it cannot be quickly and easily established from seed. 

Kudzu has been used successfully by farmers in Mississippi and 
throughout the Southeast as a temporary pasture for various types of live- 
stock for summer grazing when permanent pastures are in low production, 
as a leguminous hay crop, and as such it is comparable to alfalfa in feed- 
ing value; as a soil improvement crop on thin or eroded fields to bring un- 
productive soils back to a level of fertility necessary for profitable crop 
production. 

Probably its most outstanding use so far has been for erosion control 
on steep, sheet-eroded slopes and gullied lands that have been mutilated 
to the extent that they are seemingly beyond further use for agricultural 
purposes. In this latter use kudzu has made an outstanding contribution.

PRODUCriON AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 



DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANT 

Kudzu is a deep-rooted, vigorous, per- 
ennial legume with broad-leafed foliage, 
that grows as a vine rather than as an 
upright plant. It is a decidious plant 
and sheds its leaves after the first kill- 
ing frost in the fall. The vines grow 
outward in every direction from the or- 
iginal plant and under ideal conditions at- 
tain a length of as much as 50 feet or 
more in a single season. At the nodes 
along the vines that are in contact with 
moist soil, roots are developed and new 
plants are originated. Gradually the vine 
connecting these new plants with the or- 
iginal one dies leaving the newly formed 
plants as individuals. These are called 
crowns and these crowns are a commonly 
used method of propagation. 

The new plants in turn produce vines 
that spread over the surface and in this 
way kudzu spreads over an area until 
it completely covers the ground with a 
mass of interlaced vines that bind the 
soil in place and protect it from erosion. 
The abundance of leaves produced, if not 
otherwise used, is returned to the soil each 
fall, gradually decay, and enrich the or- 
ganic content of the soil. The leaves are 
large and palatable and are relished by 
many types of livestock. If properly man- 
aged, they may be grazed during the 
growing season or cut for hay without in- 
juring the stand or lessening its value 
for erosion control. 

Kudzu produces rather large fleshy 
roots that are sometimes several inches in 
diameter. When undisturbed for sev- 
eral years the roots may penetrate to a 
depth of 3 feet or more under favorable 
soil conditions. The plant maintains it- 
self by storing large amounts of starchy 
material in the roots, and from this 
stored reserve of food it starts its growth 
in the spring. If continuous grazing or 
frequent mowing is practiced without a 
rest period to allow the plants to store up 
this reserve of food in the roots, the vigor 



of the plants is reduced and the stand 
is gradually depleted. 

There is considerable flowering in 
kudzu but a relatively small number of 
seed are set under conditions prevailing 
in the South. Where seed can be ob- 
tained, seedling plants can be produced 
and used in establishing a stand. 

SOIL AND CLIMATIC 
ADAPTATION 

Kudzu can be successfully grown on 
a wide range of soil types with only a 
limited number of exceptions. The most 
important requirement is that the soil 
have good internal drainage. Soils of 
light to medium texture — sandy loam to 
silt loam — are best. It does not make 
good growth on infertile sands or on 
poorly drained heavy clay soils. It is not 
well adapted to the heavy soils of the 
Black Belt and it should not be planted 
on soils containing a hardpan, or shal- 
low soils in which bedrock is near the 
surface. The deep-rooted nature of the 
plant makes such soils unsuitable. Soils 
with these undesirable physical character- 
istics are of comparatively limited extent 
in the State, however, and therefore mosl 
farms contain land that is well adapted 
to kudzu. 

The fertility of the soil is not a de- 
termining factor in where kudzu may be 
grown. However, like other leguminous 
forage crops, a moderate level of fertility 
is necessary for satisfactory growth. It 
has been strongly recommended and 
widely used on eroded land, areas where 
sheet-erosion or gullying have left the 
land unsuitable for row crops. It is an 
excellent plant for such aieas, but proper 
fertilization is essential for satisfactory 
growth. Any soils that have been deplet- 
ed of plant nutrients by cropping should 
be fertilized for the establishment of 
kudzu. It should be stressed that kudzu 
is not a plant that is best adapted to poor 
eroded soils; it is recommended for such 
areas because it will grow better under 
such conditions than most any other crop

and therefore protect the land from ero- 
sion. Kudzu makes its best growth on 
fertile soils, and maximum production of 
forage for hay or pasture results from 
plantings on such soils. 

Climatic conditions in Mississippi are 
ideal for the growth of kudzu. Maxi- 
mum growth is made where the frost-free 
season is long and rainfall is ample and 
well distributed. Growth starts in the 
early spring and continues until the first 
killing frost in the fall. Periods of dry 
weather, while checking growth, have no 
serious effect on established stands be- 
cause of the deep, well developed root 
system. Severe winter temperatures kill 
the vines back to the original plant but 
in Mississippi the vines normally survive 
the winter and continue to grow in the 
spring. 

ESTABLISHING A STAND 
OF KUDZU 

Since kudzu produces seed very spar- 
ingly and only a portion of those produc- 
ed are viable, other methods of propaga- 
tion — primarily the use of crowns and 
seedlings — have been most commonly 
used. This makes the establishment of 
a stand more difficult and somewhat 
more expensive than forage crops that 
are easily established from seed, and us- 
ually requires about two years time. The 
initial establishment of a stand is the 
most important aspect of a successful crop 
and therefore special attention should be 
given to proper preparation of the land, 
selection and handling of planting stock, 
fertilization and cultivation. 

Methods of Propagation 

There are four methods that may be 
used to establish a stand of kudzu: (1) 
crowns taken from a well established 
stand; (2) seedling plants produced in a 
nursery and transplanted to the field; 
(3) vine cuttings taken from a well es- 
tablished field; (4) seed planted direcdy 
in the field. The first two methods have 



been most commonly used. All methods 
of vegetative propagation should be done 
during the time that the plants are dor- 
mant. 

Crowns 

Vines lying in contact with loose, 
moist soil develop roots at the nodes 
(joints) and as the internodes of the vine 
gradually die these rooted nodes become 
independent plants and are called crowns. 
When the crowns have developed sufficient 
root system they can be dug or plowed up 
and used for new plantings. This meth- 
od of propagation is very satisfactory and 
has been widely used. Various work- 
ers have made studies to determine what 
age and size of crowns are best for plant- 
ing stock. Sturkie and Grimes of the 
Alabama Experiment Station (1) have 
found that 2-year-old or older crowns with 
a sound bud and well developed fleshy 
roots 8 to 10 inches long are most de- 
sirable. Moderately large crowns are 
more likely to live and produce vigorous 
plants than small ones. A good crown 
has at least one fleshy root one-half inch 
or more in diameter and at least six in- 
ches long, and one or more sound buds. 
Bruised or broken crowns should not be 
used. Where possible, crowns should be 
obtained locally so they can be set within 
a few hours after they are dug and the 
roots should be kept moist at all times. 
Crowns that are purchased from a seeds- 
man should be heeled in moist soil as soon 
as received and planted as soon as possi- 
ble. From an established field of kudzu 
the crowns may be obtained by deep plow- 
ing or digging with a mattock without 
serious injury to the stand. It is report- 
ed by Bailey (2) that an average of ap- 
proximately 15,000 crowns can be ob- 
tained from an acre of well established 
kudzu. More crowns are usually pro- 
duced on sandy soils than on clay soils. 

Seedlings 

The use of seedling plants is a satisfac- 
tory method of propagation. It involves 
particular care in producing the plants

PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 



in nursery beds, and of course a source 
of seed must be available. Seed may be 
handpicked from vines that grow on some 
form of support that keeps them off the 
ground. Few seeds are produced on 
vines growing on the ground. Seed are 
borne in pods but the pods are often 
poorly filled. The seed are very small, 
there being 40,000 to 45,000 per pound. 
The seed coat is so hard that scarification 
is necessary for a satisfactory percentage 
of germination. 

Seedling plants have been produced 
rather extensively by the Soil Conserva- 
tion Service for use by cooperating far 
mers; and this organization has made 
considerable study of methods of produc- 
ing plants in nursery beds. For farmers 
who have an available source of seed and 
wish to produce their own plants, the Soil 
Conservation Service has issued a mimeo- 
graphed leaflet from the Regional Office 
at Spartanburg, South Carolina, suggest- 
ing the following procedure: 

1. Select an area that is free of nut 
grass, wild onion and nematodes, and 
as free of crab grass and weeds as possible. 
A sandy soil that can be cultivated eas- 
ily is preferable. Heavy clay soils that 
bake and crust following rains are not 
desirable. It is extremely difficult to get 
satisfactory stands on heavy soils. A red 
subsoil is desirable but not absolutely es- 
sential. 

2. Break the land and harrow it thor- 
oughly several weeks before seed is to be 
planted. Lay off deep furrows on the 
contour 30 to 36 inches apart. Apply 600 
to 800 pounds of a complete fertilizer per 
acre in the furrows and bed on the fer- 
tilizer, at least two weeks before plant- 
ing. Young kudzu seedlings are injured 
more easily by fertilizer than cotton plants. 
Drag the beds down almost flat and allow 
the soil to be well settled before planting. 

3. Begin planting at cotton planting 
time. Freshen the surface of the beds 
with light harrow so as to get a surface 
seedbed such as would be desirable for 
planting small seeded garden vegetables. 



Plant 15 to 25 scarified seeds per linear 
foot of row (seed returned by nurseries 
is already scarified). Cover the seed ap- 
proximately V4 inch deep and press the 
soil firmly over the seed with a press 
wheel or some other type of roller. 

4. Kudzu seedlings are very delicate 
and require hand weeding until they are 
large enough to be cultivated with a plow. 
A small garden plow can be used to good 
advantage in reducing the amount of 
hand weeding. Too much emphasis can 
not be placed on clean cultivation from 
the time the plants are up until they are 
large enough to produce runners and cov- 
er the ground. 

5. If plants do not grow vigorously, 
it is advisable to side dress with nitrate 
of soda at the time of cultivation, 

6. The quality of kudzu seedlings has 
been seriously damaged where the tops 
were mowed for hay during late summer 
or early fall. Do not remove any top 
growth until the seedlings are to be dug 
for transplanting. 

7. In digging seedlings be sure to get 
as much as eight inches of sound un- 
damaged root with each plant. Plants 
may be lifted with a round pointed shov- 
el where only small quantities are produc- 
ed. Where large quantities are to be dug, 
a plow that will go deep enough to get 
eight inches of sound roots may be used. 
After plants are dug, transplant them im- 
mediately to the field or heel them in 
carefully so as to avoid spoilage. 

Vine Cuttings 
That vine cuttings can be used as 
a means of propagation has been shown 
by various workers, although some diffi- 
culty has been encountered in obtaining 
a good stand. Sturkie and Grimes of 
the Alabama Experiment Station (1) re- 
porting on a comparison between vine 
cuttings and crowns in 1939 found a 
much higher survival of crowns; from 
three dates of planting used for different 
types of planting stock February was 
preferable to December or April. The 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 438 



7 



results of plantings in February from the 
use of various planting stock and meth- 
ods of planting were as follows: 

Crowns planted level with the surface 
of the ground, 77 percent survival. 

6-foot vines planted with the terminal 
bud out, 48 percent survival. 

6-foot vines completely covered, 21 per- 
cent survival. 

2-node cutting with the terminal bud 
out, 16 percent survival. 

From this investigation the Alabama 
workers advise that when using vine cut- 
tings they should be of 5- to 6-£oot lengths, 
dropped in furrows, and covered 2 to 3 
inches in depth with the top end bud 
left uncovered. 

Investigations made by Dr. G. W. John- 
ston of the Mississippi Experiment Sta- 
tion (3) in 1944 and 1945 resulted in an 
improved method of establishing kudzu 
from vine cuttings. The method involves 
the use of 2-node cuttings treated with 
a dilute solution of potassium perman- 
ganate which acts as a fungicide and also 
promotes root development. Johnston 
states that successful establishment by 
this method requires close adherence to 
a procedure involving thorough soil prep- 
aration, logether with proper selection, 
treatment, and setting of the cuttings. 
Following is the procedure recommended 
by him for using vine cuttings. 

Vines for cuttings should be carefully 
selected. The size of vines used should 
be those from pencil size up to one-half 
inch in diameter. Vines of a grayish- 
tan to tan color are more vigorous than 
dark brown or black ones. Those that 
appear even slightly dry or britde or 
that show any internal discoloration 
when cut should not be used. Often the 
tip of the vine is injured by cold to the 
extent that it is not usable. 

Proper handling at cutting time saves 
labor in later operations. Beginning at 
the tip and working back toward the 
attachment point, cut the vine into pieces 
having two nodes (joints) each having 
not more than three inches of vine ex- 



tending below the bottom node of each 
cutting. The cuttings must not dry out; 
therefore containers of water should be 
kept on hand during the cutting. As 
fast as the cuttings are gathered stand 
them in 4 to 5 inches of water with the 
basal end of the cutting in the water 
and the top end (end toward the tip of 
the vine) up. It is a good practice to 
allow the cuttings to stand in water over- 
night, or at least for several hours. 

The cuttings should be treated just prior 
to setting in a one-tenth of one percent 
solution of potassium permanganate (one 
ounce of permanganate dissolved in 7^4 
gallons of water makes the proper con- 
centration). Place the cuttings in a con- 
tainer and pour in enough permanganate 
solution to cover the cuttings to a point 
at least two inches above the bottom node; 
or transfer the cuttings from water to a 
container of the solution, being sure that 
the basal 5 to 6 inches of each cutting 
is immersed. After a period of 20 min- 
utes to one hour the cuttings should be 
removed from the solution and set im- 
mediately. The cuttings should not be- 
come dry between the time of treating and 
the time of setting. Leaving them in the 
solution for a period exceeding one hour 
is preferable to setting them while dry. 

Seed 

Low production of seed by kudzu and 
a relatively low percentage of germination 
of those produced has discouraged the 
use of seed as a means of propagation. 
An added disadvantage is that the seed 
must be handpicked from vines growing 
off the ground. In former years import- 
ed seed from Japan could be obtained on 
the commercial market. If the demand 
justifies it, this source of seed may again 
be used when trade relations are re-estab- 
lished with that country. 

The hard seed coat characteristic of the 
kudzu seed make scarification essential 
for any appreciable percentage of germi- 
nation. Several investigators have re- 
ported discouraging results even after 



8 



PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 



scarification. McKee and Stephens (4) 
report as follows in U.S.D.A. Farmers' 
Bulletin 1923: 

"Laboratory tests and field experience 
show that low germination of kudzu seed 
must be expected. Scarified seed usually 
germinates only 50 percent, and subse- 
quent loss will so reduce the stand that 
only about a fifth of the germinable seed 
can be expected to become established 
nursery plants." 

Experiments conducted in 1939 by Dr. 
H. W. Bennett of the Mississippi Experi- 
ment Station (5) gave excellent results 
from the use of sulfuric acid to treat the 
seed before planting. The acid removes 
part of the hard seed coat and thereby im- 
proves the germination. In the experi- 
ment concentrated sulfuric acid proved 
to be more effective than any rate of 
dilution. The seed were treated for 1, 3, 
and 6 minutes and the stand counts show- 
ed that germination was faster with those 
seed treated for six minutes. Maximum 
germination had been reached in 4 to 5 
weeks. Unscarified seed gave a germina- 
tion of 24 percent as compared to an av- 
erage of 88 percent for the seed treated 
with concentrated sulfuric acid. Dr. Ben- 
nett outlines the following procedure for 
treating seed with acid and planting di- 
rectly in the field: 

"Place seed in a glass, earthenware, or 
wooden container. Pour in commercial 
sulfuric acid while stirring until the seed 
are well moistened. Continue stirring 
for three to six minutes. Pour onto a 
screen and wash well. Seed may then 
be planted or dried and planted. Prevent 
the acid from touching the body or cloth- 
ing, as it may burn severely." 

"The following directions should be 
followed in planting kudzu seed: lay off 
rows six feet apart by throwing two to 
four furrows on the row. This should be 
done three to four weeks before planting 
in order that a firm seedbed may be 
obtained. During the month of May form 
beds on the row at six-foot intervals. Plant 
20 to 30 seed per hill and cover very light- 



ly. Prevent crust from forming by scratch- 
ing around the hill with a rake or hoe. 
When planted in this manner, one pound 
of seed is sufficient for one acre. The 
kudzu planting should be cultivated and 
hoed soon to be kept free of grass and 
weeds during the first year." 

Soil Preparation, Planting, 
and Spacing 

Thorough preparation of the soil is 
one of the most important considerations 
in the successful establishment of a stand 
of kudzu. The preparation is the same 
regardless of the type of planting stock 
to be used. It should be as thorough as 
for corn or any other row crop. Land 
that has been out of cultivation or that 
has grown foul with weeds should be 
plowed, and harrowed with a disk or 
spike-tooth harrow. Plowing should be 
deep, especially on the heavier soils to 
enable the roots to penetrate the soil. At 
least 30 days prior to planting the land 
should be bedded into rows to insure 
a firm, moist bed for planting. The width 
of rows will be governed by the plan of 
spacing and cultivation. 

Planting of kudzu whether it be 
crowns, vine cuttings or seedling plants 
should be done during the dormant stage 
of growth, that is usually from Decem- 
ber through February or early March. 
Various methods of planting have been 
used. Probably the most satisfactory but 
also the most time consuming is that of 
digging holes along the bed for each in- 
dividual plant. Make the hole deep 
enough to allow the full extension of the 
roots, but avoid placing the roots in di- 
rect contact with fertilizer or manure 
that has been applied before bedding. 
Firm the soil around the plant from bot- 
tom to top leaving the bud slightly above 
the surface of the ground. This method 
of planting is made faster by opening a 
furrow in the bed with a bull tongue or 
small shovel. 

Where treated vine cuttings are to be 
used as described earlier from Dr. John- 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 438

ston's work the following procedure is 
advised: 

"Setting is done either entirely by hand 
or by a combination of plow and hand. 
Though the former method usually gives 
better results, the latter saves bodi time 
and labor. When setting by hand, holes 
should be dug in the bed with a mattock, 
hoe, etc. Dig the holes as deep as pos- 
sible without striking the fertilized area, 
or the subsoil in case no fertilizer was ap- 
plied. Set the vines, treated end down, 
as nearly upright as possible and firm the 
soil around them from bottom to top. The 
cuttings should be covered to within a 
short distance of the top node. In cases 
where the length of the cuttings prohibits 
such procedure, cover as much of the stem 
as possible. 

When using the plow-hand method, 
open the beds either with a turning plow 
or long shovel. Two furrows per row 
will usually be needed in order to open 
a trench of sufficient depth. Stand the 
cuttings upright in the furrow and pack 
the soil firmly around the base with the 
hand or feet. Then, using the turning 
plow, throw soil as high as possible around 
the cuttings without covering the top 
node. The bed should not be opened too 
far in advance of setting as the loss of 
moisture will hinder the rooting of the 
cuttings." 

A variety of methods of spacing kudzu 
plants in the field have been used and 
each method has its own merits. No one 
specific procedure serves all purposes. 
Spacing should be determined by the in- 
dividual in accordance with the specific 
factors involved. 

If an ample supply of planting stock 
is available and rapid coverage of the land 
is desired, close spacing should be used. 
Planting 1,000 plants per acre gives rela- 
tively close spacing and with proper fer- 
tilization and clean cultivation will usual- 
ly give a full stand in one year. Using 
42-inch rows and setting plants six feet 
apart in the row on every other row re- 
quires approximately 1,000 plants per acre. 



The alternate rows may be planted to 
corn or some other row crop the first 
year. 

If there is no hurry to establish the 
stand or if it is desirable to obtain a 
stand at less cost the number of plants 
per acre can be reduced to 500 by setting 
plants six feet apart on every fourth row; 
and again the remaining rows may be 
planted to a row crop that will be clean 
cultivated during the first two years. With 
this method, provided the plants grow 
vigorously, a full stand may be expect- 
ed by the end of the second year. It is 
not necessary to plant an intertilled crop 
with kudzu but it is usually advisable 
since the land must be cultivated to keep 
it from becoming foul, and by using an 
intertilled crop some return may be got- 
ten from the land while the kudzu is be- 
coming established. A one-year old stand 
of kudzu interplanted with corn is shown 
in figure 1. 

On terraced land, especially on steep 
slopes, kudzu may be established by plant- 
ing along the terrace ridges. It should 
be fertilized and cultivated the first year 
to enable the plants to become well estab- 
lished. Cultivation of the land between 
terraces may be continued until the kudzu 
has spread over these areas; or the kudzu 
may be kept confined to the terrace by 
continuous clean cultivation of the inter- 
vals between. 

Methods of spacing need not be con- 
fined to those described above. Any plan 
may be devised to fit into the conditions 
of a particular situation. Spacing in the 
row may be reduced to 3 or 4 feet or in- 
creased to more than six feet and spacing 
between rows planted to kudzu may be 
varied according to the individual situa- 
tion. 

Preparation of the soil, planting and 
spacing for the control of erosion on 
gullied land, on banks and fills, and in 
diversion ditches is a somewhat different 
problem from that of an open field. Each 
case presents its own specific problems. 
Thorough preparation of the soil, ferti- 



10 



PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 



lization, and care in planting are just 
as essential as for field plantings. These 
practices will be discussed later under 
use of kudzu for erosion control. 

Fertilization of Kudzu 

When plantings of kudzu are made on 
eroded land and soils of low fertility, 
fertilization is essential to the successful 
establishment of a stand. It is advisable 
to use commercial fertilizer and man- 
ure on most soils for the initial establish- 
ment of a stand to insure vigorous growth 
of the plants and especially to hasten the 
development of a good root system. Fail- 
ures may easily result from plantings on 
infertile eroded soils unless sufficient 
plant food is supplied to insure the estab 
lishment of the plants. 

For field plantings on thin soils where 
the land is bedded into rows, the fertilizer 
and manure should be applied in a fur- 
row and the rows bedded on it. When 
manure is available apply 1 to 3 tons 
per acre, and 200 to 400 pounds of super- 
phosphate per acre or its equivalent in 
some other form of available phosphatic 
fertilizer. If manure is not available use 
300 to 600 pounds per acre of an 0-14-7 
fertilizer with sufficient nitrogenous fer- 
tihzer added to supply about 20 to 30 
pounds of nitrogen per acre. On more 
fertile soils the nitrogen may be omitted, 
but it is good insurance to hasten estab- 
lishment of plants. 

The fertilizer and manure should be 
applied in a deep furrow and the rows 
bedded on it at least one month and pre- 
ferably a longer time before planting, to 
allow the fertilizer to dissolve and the 
manure to decompose. Severe injury or 
death of plants will likely result from 
placing plant roots in contact with un 
rotted manure or a concentration of fer- 
tilizer. 

If individual holes are to be used for 
planting around gullies or on banks or 
fills, dig the hole to a depth of 12 to 15 
inches, mix a small amount of manure 
and 1 or 2 pounds of fertilizer with the 



soil in the lower part of the hole, then 
refill the hole. This should be done far 
enough in advance to allow the manure 
to rot and the soil to be settled by rain 
before the plants are set. 

When established stands of kudzu fail 
CO make good growth it is advisable to 
apply a broadcast application of fertilizer, 
particularly phosphate. Fertilizer investi- 
gations with kudzu in various southeast- 
ern states have generally shown more pro- 
nounced response to phosphate than to 
potash or lime. 

A series of experiments were conducted 
on five depleted soils in Alabama by 
Richardson (6) of the Soil Conservation 
Service to determine the effect of phos- 
phate from different sources, and of pot- 
ash and lime on the yield of kudzu. A 
comparison of basic slag, superphosphate 
and triple superphosphate showed that 
these materials did not differ in their ef- 
fects on yields when applied on an equiva- 
lent phosphoric acid content basis. 

In a summary table of the several ex- 
periments (table I) Richardson shows the 
effects of phosphate applied at two rates, 
potash and lime, alone and in combina- 
tion, on the yields of kudzu. A single 
broadcast application was made on estab- 
lished stands and yields were obtained 
over a period of two to four years follow- 
ing the applications. The use of potash 
or lime alone gave little or no increase 
In yield, but when used together a mark- 
ed increase resulted. 

The applications of 64 pounds of phos- 
phoric acid alone resulted in a very pro- 
nounced increase in yield, with further 
increases when it was used in combina- 
tion with potash or lime or both. The 
128-pound application of phosphoric acid 
alone produced a significantly higher yield 
than the lower rate of application, but 
little additional increase resulted from ap- 
plications of potash and lime in conjunc- 
tion with it. 

Further evidence of the value of ferti- 
lizing kudzu may be seen from the follow-

ing statements made by Bailey (2) in 
U.S.D.A. Farmers' Bulletin 1840: 

"Fertilizer field trials conducted in 
1938 on 41 plantings of kudzu on heavy 
clay valley soils and gravelly hill soils 
in the Anniston, Alabama, demonstra- 
tion area of the Soil Conservation Service 
included comparable strips which receiv- 
ed applications of basic slag at the rates 
of 800 and 1,600 pounds per acre and 
one strip on which 600 pounds of basic 
slag and 1^50 pounds of nitrate of soda 
per acre were applied. The fertilizer was 
broadcast in the early spring. In some 
cases the land was thoroughly disked aft- 
er the fertilizer was applied, and on oth- 
er areas the surface of the soil was not 
disturbed." 

"The results of the fertilizer treatments 
showed conclusively that kud/v! respond- 
ed to phosphate on all soils inchniecl in 
the trials. In every case there was p 
marked increase in growth where phos- 
phate was applied, and the heavier ap- 
plications produced greater growth than 
did the lighter ones. Growth of plants 
treated with nitrate of soda and basic 
slag was not so good as that of plants 
treated with basic slag only. Weeds and 
grass grew vigorously in the spring on 
the strip where nitrate of soda was ap- 
plied. It was thought that competition 
from these plants retarded the growth of 
kudzu. In most of these trials where 
kudzu was planted in the spring of 1936, 



the fertilized strips in 1938 made enough 
growth to provide a fair cutting of hay, 
whereas the unfertilized strips made bare- 
ly enough growth to cover the ground. 
Disking after the fertilizer was applied 
destroyed weeds and grass and appeared 
to stimulate the growth of kudzu." 

"Applications of phosphate and man- 
ure on various soils in the Southeast in 
1937 and 1938 gave results which showed 
conclusively that both of these materials 
stimulate the growth of kudzu on severe- 
ly eroded areas and lessen the time re- 
quired for establishing a stand. Com- 
parative results from fertilized and unfer- 
tilized kudzu on severely eroded areas on 
many farms under cooperative agreement 
with the Soil Conservation Service dem- 
onstrate that the use of phosphate is neces- 
sary and also that stable manure is an 
important factor in establishing a stand." 

Cultivation 

The clean cultivation of new plantings 
of kudzu is just as important as any 
other aspect of stand establishment. The 
following discussion from Farmers' Bul- 
letin 1840 by Bailey (2) outHnes the 
practices that should be followed and ex- 
plains why cultivation of new plantings 
is necessary. 

"Clean cultivation during the first and, 
sometimes, the second growing season is 
one of the most important requirements 
for the establishment of a stand. The 



12 



PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 




root system of a kudzu plant is drastical- 
ly reduced when the plant is dug. As a 
result of this reduction, competition for 
moisture by other types of vegetation 
growing along the rows seriously retards 
the growth of kudzu during the first 
spring and summer, unless clean cultiva- 
tion is given. It is essential that plants 
be given clean cultivation along the rows 
during the entire growing season the first 
year. If necessary, weeds and grass 
should be hoed out of the rows. Suffic- 
ient plowing along the rows to control 
other vegetation, to keep the soil well 
broken, and to keep the vines dragged 
back to a relatively narrow strip along 
each row is necessary." 

"Such a system of cultivation prevents 
competition by weeds and grass and also 
results in the development of a thick 



stand of plants along the rows. Cultiva- 
tion keeps the surface of the soil in good 
condition for vines to take root at the 
nodes. Soil thrown on runners by the 
plow also induces root formation at the 
nodes, thus further increasing the number 
of new plants formed." 

"It is important that the middles be- 
tween the rows of kudzu be plowed in 
the spring and planted to clean-cultivated 
row crops. Cotton or corn is more de- 
sirable for this purpose than legumes such 
as cowpeas, soybeans, or velvetbeans. The 
cultivation necessary for the row crops 
will control weeds in the middles and 
keep the soil in good condition for the 
establishment of new kudzu plants dur- 
ing the latter half of the growing season, 
after cultivation with the plow has been 
completed. 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 438

"This system of cultivation has the ad- 
vantage that a crop return may be ob- 
tained from the land during the period 
required for the establishment of kudzu. 
Such use of the land is important, par- 
ticularly on farms with limited acreage 
for the production of feed crops. The 
greater part of the cultivation necessary 
for kudzu is thus obtained as a by-prod- 
uct in the production of other crops. 

**On fairly fertile soils, where kudzu 
makes rapid growth, the plants will usu- 
ally produce runners that take root and 
establish new plants between the rows 
after plowing is discontinued the first 
summer. Where this results in a fail 
stand of plants over the entire surface 
of the soil between the rows, it is prob- 
ably not advisable to cultivate the sec- 
ond year. If, on the other hand, the land 
is very poor and the first-year growth of 
kudzu is not sufficient to establish a fair 
stand of plants in the middles during the 
latter half of the summer, it is advisable 
to plant clean-tilled row crops in the mid- 
dles the second year. It is very impor- 
tant that a strong vigorous stand of 
plants be established along the original 
row before cultivation of row crops in 
the middles is discontinued." 

"Frequently a few scattered plants are 
established in the middles during the lat 
ter half of the first growing season and 
cultivation is discontinued the second sea- 
son because of the possibility of destroy- 
ing these plants. Under such conditions, 
it is usually advisable to plow the middles 
and plant at least two rows of a clean 
tilled crop in each the second year, even 
though a few plants are destroyed. 

"By giving enough cultivation to con- 
trol weeds and to keep the surface of the 
soil in good condition, a much larger 
number of plants will be formed and a 
thicker stand will be established than if 
cultivation is discontinued before a vigor- 
ous stand is established along the original 
row. If grass and weeds are allowed to 
grow in the middles the second year, 
they will support the runners and prevent 



their coming in contact with the soil suf- 
ficiently to give a thick stand of new 
plants. It is extremely important that 
a thick stand of plants be obtained be- 
cause a thick stand produces more effec- 
tive ground cover and larger yields of 
hay. No other operation in connection 
with the establishment of a stand of kud- 
zu is more important than clean first- 
year cultivation, and second-year cultiva 
tion where needed." 

Disking established stands of kudzu 
has proven to be a beneficial practice. 
This serves several purposes. On newly 
established stands (2 or 3-years old) cut- 
ting the vines with a disk results in a 
thicker stand and a higher proportion 
of leaves. Weeds and grasses are de- 
stroyed. When the stands are first estab- 
lished it is advisable to make broadcast 
applications of fertilizer and the disking 
will serve to work it into the soil. The 
entire area should be disked including the 
original rows where the kudzu was plant- 
ed. Light disking is all that is necessary 
to cut the vines and work them into some 
loose soil. Deep disking that turns the 
soil and cuts the roots loose at a depth 
of several inches may be injurious and 
should be avoided. 

USES OF KUDZU 

Kudzu may be used to serve many pur- 
poses on the farm. For controlling badly 
eroded and gullied areas it is one of the 
best plants that can be used. Fields that 
have been depleted of fertility by continu- 
ous cropping may be greatly improved by 
planting to kudzu for a period of years 
allowing the growth produced to go back 
to the land and thereby greatly improving 
the organic content of the soil. When it 
is properly managed kudzu is excellent 
for supplementary pasture or as a legume 
hay crop. On many farms in Mississippi 
kudzu can be used to good advantage for 
one or more of these purposes. 

Kudzu For Pasture 

On a number of Mississippi farms kud- 
zu is now being used for pasture, prim-

PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU

kudzu is five years old. It is on land that was poorly suited to cultivation. 



arily for supplementary grazing during 
the summer months. It is very palatable 
and is relished by many types of live- 
stock. It has been used for beef cattle, 
dairy cows, hogs, and chickens. Its use 
as a pasture crop for livestock is by no 
means new. As early as 1917 the Ala- 
bama Experiment Station used it for graz- 
ing dairy cattle to determine its palatabil- 
ity and its effect on the flavor of the 
milk. Investigations in recent years have 
shown it to be of great value as a sup- 
plementary grazing crop when permanent 
pastures are in low production. 

Kudzu For Beef Cattle 
The value of kudzu for temporary pas- 
ture for beef cattle has been under in- 
vestigation at the Natchez Branch Station 
since 1940. This work has been carried 
out by H. W. Bennett, S. P. Crockett, 



and R. W. Williams of the Mississippi 
Experiment Station staff. A 7-acre field 
too eroded for profitable use for row 
crops, was planted to kudzu in March 
1940, at the rate of 500 crowns per acre. 
Corn was grown between the kudzu rows 
during the first two years. By the third 
year (1942) the kudzu had made sur**- 
a growth that it was allowed to cover the 
entire area. Just before frost, the latter 
part of October, 1942, the kudzu was 
mowed for hay and produced a yield of 
1.5 tons per acre. In January of 1943 the 
entire area was disked three times. The 
disking resulted in a thicker stand with 
a higher proportion of leaves, and destroy- 
ed many weeds present in the stand. 
Figure 2 shows cattle grazing on this field 
after the kudzu was well established. 
In 1943 the 7-acre field of kudzu was

used for temporary pasture for beef cat- 
tle. On June 4 a group of 23 cows and 
7 calves were put on the field and grazed 
for a 28-day period. During this time the 
animals made a total gain of 540 pounds, 
equivalent to 77 pounds per acre or 2.75 
pounds of beef per acre per day. After 
this heavy rate of grazing — over four ani- 
mals per acre — tlie field was stocked with 
six yearling heifers vvh'ch were put on 
[uly 7 and grazed until August 27, a pe- 
riod of 51 days. At the end of this graz- 
ing period the animals had made a total 
gain of 450 pounds or 75 pounds per ani- 
mal. This amounts to 64.3 pounds gain 
per acre or an average daily gain of 1.26 
pounds per acre. Combining the two 
grazing periods the 7-acre field of kudzu 
produced a total gain in liveweight of 
the animals of 990 pounds during the 79- 
day grazing period, or 141 pounds per 
acre. And this was produced at a time 
when the permanent pasture was produc- 
ing very little and would have been seri- 
ously over-grazed had there been no sup- 
plementary pasture available. 

During 1944 the kudzu was nof used 
for grazing but a crop of hay was har- 
vested which produced an average of 2.3 
tons per acre. Grazing tests were con- 
tinued in 1945 and 1946. 

In 1945 grade Hereford and native 
steers (yearlings and 2-year olds) were 
used and 15 steers were grazed on the 7- 
acre field for a period of 60 days during 
July and August. The rate of stocking 
the pasture was approximately two ani- 
mals per acre or 1.09 animal units per 
acre. The results are summarized in 
table 2. The 60 days grazing produced 



a total gain of 1,525 pounds, an average 
of 218 pounds per acre, or an average 
daily gain of 3.63 pounds per acre. The 
native 2-year old steers made much more 
total gain than the grade Herefords and 
more than twice as much as the native 
yearlings. 

To obtain further information in 1946 
on the value of the kudzu for various 
types of animals, a group of 10 mature 
native cows without calves were grazed 
from August 1 to September 25, a period 
of 56 days. The cows ranged in weight 
from 550 to 940 pounds, with an aver- 
age weight of 703 pounds, which made 
the rate of stocking one animal unit per 
acre. The average weight of the cows 
showed no appreciable gain at the end 
of the first 28-day period, but all animals 
gained rapidly during the second 28 
days. At the end of the grazing period 
the group had made a total gain in live- 
weight of 1,135 pounds or an average of 
113.5 pounds per animal. With these 
animals the kudzu produced 162 pounds 
liveweight per acre or an average daily 
(Tain of 2.9 pounds per acre. 

The results at the Natchez Branch Sta- 
tion show that kudzu, even on land un- 
suited to cultivation, furnishes excellent 
temporary pasture for various types of 
beef cattle and that it can be rather heav- 
ily grazed during the summer for a pe- 
riod of at least 60 days. If grazing is to 
be continued for a period of two months 
or longer the rate of stocking should not 
be heavier than the equivalent of one 
animal unit per acre. A longer grazing 
period may be used by stocking at a low- 
er rate. When stocked so that all of the 



16 



PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 



growth made is not consumed, grazing 
may be continued until killing frost. And. 
after growth has been stopped by frost, 
the surplus remaining may then be grazed 
if additional grazing is needed at that 
time. Particular caution should be ex- 
ercised while kudzu is being pastured to 
prevent over-grazing, for such a practice 
will damage the stand and lessen its value 
the following year. Too heavy grazing 
or too frequent mowing prevents the 
plants from storing an ample reserve of 
carbohydrates in the roots from which 
to start growth the following spring. 
Kudzu For Dairy Cattle 
That kudzu is also excellent pasturage 
for dairy cattle has been shown by in- 
vestigations carried out by the Alabama 
Experiment Station (1). Following is a 
report of an experiment conducted in 
1934. 

"During the summer of 1934, a study 
was inaugurated by the Dairy Department 
at Auburn to observe the relative merits 
of kudzu versus native grass pasture for 
dairy cows. Two cows were grazed on a 
luxuriant growth of kudzu and were al- 
ternated with two cows on native grass 
pasture at 28-day intervals. Both lots of 
cows were fed grain at the rate of one 
pound daily to each 2.5 pounds of milk 
produced. The observations covered 
three 28-day periods, June 11 to Septem- 
ber 2, 1934, after which the test was dis- 
continued because of severe drought. Dur- 
ing the 84 days the two cows on kudzu 
pasture produced a total of 426 pounds 
more milk and 22 pounds more butterfat 
than the two cows on native grass pasture. 
The two cows on kudzu gained in body 
weight a total of 108 pounds and the two 
cows on grass pasture lost a total of 52 
pounds." 

A second experiment carried out in 
1938 was made to compare milk produc- 
tion of cows grazing on kudzu with no 
supplementary feed to cows on native 
grass pasture with the same grain supple- 
ment as used in 1934. There were three 
cows in each lot and the duration of the 



test was 140 days. The cows on grass 
pasture with grain supplement (10.9 
pounds grain per cow per day) gave only 
a slightly higher daily production. The 
daily increase per cow was .91 pounds of 
milk and .06 pounds of butterfat. These 
results indicate that cows will produce 
well on kudzu pasture without supple- 
mentary feed if the pasture is stocked at 
the rate of not more than one cow per 
acre. 

Kudzu For Hogs 

The value of kudzu pasture for hogs 
was studied by the Alabama Experiment 
Station (1) over a 3-year period, from 
1937 to 1939. Various sizes and ages of 
hogs were used, from a sow with suckling 
pigs to medium sized shoats. It was 
found that it was necessary to supplement 
the pasture with grain feeding if satis- 
factory gains were to be made. Results 
of the test with shoats in 1939 are sum- 
marized in table 3. These results show 
that kudzu alone is little better than 
carrying pasture for the shoats. The fol- 
lowing recommendations are made on the 
basis of the results of the experiments. 

"Suckling sows grazing kudzu should 
be fed from 2 to 2.5 pounds of grain sup- 
plement per head daily for each 100 
pounds liveweight. Pigs weighing from 
25 to 75 pounds should receive 1 pound 
of grain supplement daily per 100 pounds 
liveweight. One acre of good kudzu will 
carry from 4 to 6 head of mature hogs. 
Hogs like the fleshly roots of the kudzu 
plant and are bad about rooting it up. 
Rings should be placed in the noses of 
hogs before they are turned on kudzu 
pasture. F^^en this may not prove com- 
pletely effective if the kudzu is growing 
on sandy soil." 

Kudzu For Laying Hens 

Investigations conducted by the Poul- 
try Department of the Alabama Experi- 
ment Station (1) have shown that kudzu 
is an excellent grazing crop for laying 
hens. In tests carried over a period of 
five years the kudzu was grazed from

about May 1 until October 1. Compar- 
able lots of hens given the same base ra- 
tion were used to compare kudzu graz- 
ing to no green feed. The hens grazing 
kudzu produced an average of 10 eggs 
per bird per month while those with no 
green feed produced only 6.2 eggs per 
bird per month. The following state- 
ments were made concerning the use of 
kudzu for grazing chickens. 

"It will furnish grazing from about 
May 1 until frost. Kudzu will not stand 
continuous grazing and for best results 
the chickens should be rotated every 30 
to 45 days. One-half acre of well estab- 
hshed kudzu divided into two lots is 
sufficient for 100 hens." 

Kudzu For Hay 

Kudzu has a number of advantages as 
a hay crop for Mississippi farms. It is 
a perennial plant and once established it 
will continue to produce over a period of 
years. With proper fertilization it will 
produce good yields of hay on land that 
cannot be profitably used for cultivated 
crops. It does not have a critical stage 
of growth for cutting as do most hay 
plants, but may be cut at any convenient 
time from early summer to late fall. Un- 
like the annual hay plants in which germ- 
ination or growth may be seriously af- 
fected by weather conditions, particularly 
droughts, kudzu can be depended upon 
to make a fair yield of hay every year. 
Its feeding value is comparable to alfalfa 
hay. 

One or two cuttings may be made dur- 



ing a season. More than two cuttings 
per season is likely to weaken the plants 
and deplete the stand. One cutting can 
be made in June or July whenever its 
most convenient. When two cuttings 
are made, the first one should be early in 
the summer and the second late in the 
fall just before the normal date of the 
first killing frost. 

Considerable work has been done by 
the Alabama Experiment Station to de- 
termine the proper time and frequency of 
cutting that would give the highest yield 
of hay and maintain the stand of kudzu. 
Results of some of this work are shown 
in table 4 in which one, two, and three 
cuttings per season were compared, as well 
as the time of making the cuttings. This 
experiment was conducted on an Orange- 
berg sandy loam soil at Monroeville, Ala- 
bama. Soils of this series occur exten- 
sively in Southern Mississippi and to a 
lesser extent in the Central and North- 
eastern parts of the State. The results 
in the table show that three cuttings yield 
no more hay than two cuttings per sea- 
son; that three cuttings so depleted the 
stand in six years time that further cut- 
ting had to be discontinued; that June 1 
and November 1 were the optimum times 
for cutting in order to maintain a good 
stand that would be free of weeds. It 
should be noted that an average of over 
three tons of hay per acre were produced 
on this soil. 

In good haying weather kudzu cures 
rapidly and ordinarily can be stored in the 
barn the day after it is mowed. Cutting 



18 



PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 



should be done when the ground and the 
kudzu are dry, left in the swath for a few 
hours, then windrovved. The next morning 
after the dew is off, the windrows should 
be turned; and by afternoon the hay may 
be baled or put in the barn. Some dif- 
ficulty may be experienced in mowing, 
particularly fields that are being mowed 
for the first time, in getting the swath to 
separate from the uncut vines. A simple 
shop-made rider bar which is attached to 
the outer shoe of the mower blade great- 
ly simplifies the mowing problem. This 
device was originated by the Agricultural 
Engineering Department at Auburn, Ala- 
bama, and is described in Alabama Ex- 
periment Station Leaflet No. 16. 

To determine the value of kudzu hay 
for wintering beef cattle of various ages 
the Animal Husbandry Department of 



the Mississippi Experiment Station (7) 
conducted feeding trials in the winter 
of 1941-42, in which animals fed only 
kudzu hay were compared to animals fed 
the standard wintering ration of Dallis 
grass hay, sorghum silage, and cottonseed 
meal. Calves, yearling heifers, and ma- 
ture cows were used in the tests. The 
calves weighing just over 350 pounds 
and fed 12 pounds of kudzu hay daily, 
lost three pounds per head during the 
first two weeks; while those on standard 
ration gained 20 pounds per head dur- 
ing the same time. The condition of 
the calves fed kudzu was considered to 
be so unsatisfactory that the test was 
not continued. 

Mature Hereford cows in a high state 
of condition and weighing about 1,200 
each were fed 12 pounds of kudzu hay

iThe stand was so poor that the plot was not cut in 1939. The kudzu was left to re-establish 
a stand.

in Alabama, Page 7. 



for a period of 63 days. During this pe- 
riod they lost an average of 65 pounds per 
head while those fed the standard ration 
gained 46 pounds each. The loss in 
weight of the cows fed kudzu was not 
considered serious because of their orig- 
inal high state of condition. 

Yearling heifers were carried in the 
feeding trials for a 90-day wintering pe- 
riod. Those fed kudzu (slightly over 11 
pounds per head daily) approximately 
maintained their weight; those on stan- 
dard ration gained 85 pounds per head. 

On the basis of these preliminary trials 
it was stated that where other feeds are 
not available, or are too expensive, kudzu 
hay may serve as the principal feed for 
bringing yearling heifers or bred cows 
through the winter in a satisfactory con- 
dition; especiaUy if as much of this hay 
is fed as is usually fed of most other hays 
for wintering cattle of these ages. It 
was not considered a satisfactory feed for 
wintering beef calves. 

Polk and Gieger (8) of the Mississippi 
Experiment Station made a study involv- 
ing the use of kudzu meal to replace al- 
falfa meal in the starting ration of grow- 
ing chicks. The results of this work were 
reported in Experiment Station Bulletin 
414 in March, 1945. The experiments 
showed that there was no significant dif- 
ference in the final average weights of 
chicks grown in batteries up to nine 



weeks of age when fed alfalfa meal, kud- 
zu meal, or kudzu leaf meal at the rate 
of nine percent of the ration. Under the 
conditions of the experiment, kudzu prod- 
ucts compared favorably to alfalfa meal 
from the standpoint of average chick 
weights, mortality, grade, and feed re- 
quired to produce one pound of gain. 

Kudzu For Erosion Control 

Erosion is a serious problem on many 
Mississippi farms and in many cases it 
has caused abandonment of fields that 
were once cultivated. The erosion prob- 
lem is most serious on hill farms in which 
most of the cultivated land is continuous- 
ly planted to clean cultivated row crops 
with little or no precautionary measures 
being observed to prevent erosion. 

Areas that have become gullied to the 
extent that cultivation is no longer profit- 
able can be satisfactorily brought under 
control by planting to kudzu, and with- 
in a few years time yield additional re- 
turn as temporary pasture. Kudzu is an 
ideal plant for a variety of situations 
where the soil is subjected to erosion. In 
addition to gullied land and steeply slop- 
ing fields, diversion channels, terrace out- 
lets, highway and railway banks and fills 
when covered with a good stand of kud- 
zu are well protected against erosion. 

The value of kudzu for the protection 
of banks and fills against erosion may be 
seen in many places along Mississippi

PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF KUDZU 



Figure 4. On Highway 60 near Port Gibson, Mississippi, kudzu has completely covered the 
banks and gives them good protection from erosion. Note how it covers over nearly vertical 
banks where few other plants could be established. 



highways. Figure 4, a view along High- 
way 60 near Port Gibson, Mississippi 
shows how kudzu will cover over almost 
vertical banks. The abundance of leafy 
vegetation together with the mass of in- 
terlaced vines and accumulated organic 
material protects the soil from direct rain- 
fall and impedes surface run-off as well 
as increasing infiltration of the water. 
That gullies can be completely brought 
under control is shown in figures 5 and 
6 showing a gully at the Natchez Station 
before and after it was planted to kudzu 
The effectiveness of kudzu in prevent- 
ing water run-off and soil loss is shown 
in table 4, from work done by the Soil 
Conservation Service at the Southern 
Piedmont Conservation Experiment Sta- 
tion at Watkinsvillc, Georgia, on land 
that was classed as suitable for only oc- 
casional or limited cultivation. The av- 
erage annual rainfall at this location was 



50.37 inches. The data show that only 
a negligible amount of soil was lost un- 
der kudzu and that only about one- 
fourth as much water was lost as under 
continuous cotton. 

In making plantings on gullied areas 
the plants should be set in and around 
the gullies in places where there is suf- 
ficient soil to insure establishment of the 
plants. In areas above and between gul- 
lies the plants should be set in rows on 
the contour to facilitate cultivation. In 
the immediate vicinity of gullies, and in 
the gullies, it will generally be necessary 
to set the plants in individually prepared 
holes. The holes should be made 12 to 
18 inches in diameter and 12 to 15 inches 
deep; mix fertilizer and manure with 
the soil, refill the hole and allow suf- 
ficient time for rains to settle the soil be- 
fore setting the plants. It is a good prac- 
tice to set two plants in each hole.

Brush dams built across small gullies 
causing an accumulation of silt will pro- 
vide a place to set plants in the gully. In 
large caving gullies plants may be set 
in topsoil that has fallen into the gully. 
Plants should also be spaced along the 
rim of the gully a few feet from the gully 
wall. With liberal use of manure and 
fertilizer, the plants will gradually cover 
over the gully and prevent further ero- 
sion. A gully at the Natchez Branch 
Station that has been completely cover- 
ed over by kudzu is shown in figure 6. 

Kudzu can be established on banks and 
fills where it is very difficult or impos- 
sible to get a grass-legume sod establish- 
ed. Plants set along the top of a bank 
will readily spread down over the slope 
and give it good protection from erosion. 

Kudzu For Soil Improvement 

Fields that have been continuously 
cropped to clean cultivated row crops un- 
til the soil has reached such a low level 
of production that it is hardly profitable 
to continue cultivating can be greatly 
improved in a few years time by planting 
to kudzu. The kudzu not only protects 
the land from erosion, but produces an 
abundance of vegetation that when plow- 
ed under greatly increases the productive- 
ness of the soil. That kudzu is an excel- 
lent plant for soil improvement has been 
shown by work done by the Alabama Ex- 
periment Station (1). 

In an experiment at Auburn, Alabama, 
kudzu was planted in the early spring of 
1916, allowed to grow for three years 
then turned under in the spring of 1919. 
The land was then continuously cropped 
from 1919 through 1929, during which 
time two crops of sorghum hay, four 



crops of corn, and seven crops of oats were 
grown on the area devoted to the experi- 
ment. The average yields of these crops 
grown following kudzu and where kud- 
zu was not grown (table 5) shows the 
effect of kudzu on succeeding crops. The 
increased yields of crops resulting from 
planting them following kudzu were as 
follows: 

Sorghum hay, 2,536 pounds per acre- 
Corn, 19.3 bushels per acre; 
Oats, 7.9 bushels per acre. 

Even 10 years after the kudzu was 
plowed under, crops still showed beneficial 
effects. 

A second investigation was conducted 
between 1930 and 1939 to study the ef- 
fect of kudzu on the fertility of the soil. 
Experiments were conducted at two lo- 
cations in which the kudzu was planted 
and allowed to remain for four years, 
after which it was plowed under and five 
successive crops of corn were grown. 
Prior to planting the kudzu the land pro- 
duced 7 to 10 bushels of corn per acre. 
The 5-year average yield of corn follow- 
ing kudzu was 34 bushels at one loca- 
tion and 30 bushels at the other. These 
results show the marked effect of kudzu 
on the fertility of the soil. 

The Alabama workers state that with 
the soil improvement value of kudzu, it 
would be a good crop in a rotation if a 
means by which it could be easily estab- 
lished every few years were devised. They 
suggest the possibility of using it on hilly 
areas that are terraced. Get kudzu estab- 
lished on the terraces and when it is de- 
sirable to establish it on the intervals be- 
tween terraces, corn could be planted and 
laid by early thereby giving the vines a

chance to run across the corn rows and 
take root. After a few years in kudzu 
the land could be plowed and again plant- 
ed to row crops, leaving the kudzu on 
the terraces. By clean cultivation ii 
could be kept confined to the terraces; 
and at the same time this growth would 
always serve to re-establish the field when- 
ever it was desirable. Such a plan of 
handling kudzu is now under investigation 
by the Alabama Experiment Station. 

Further information on the soil im- 
provement value of kudzu is available 
from the work done in Alabama by E. 
C. Richardson of the Soil Conservation 
Service. Tests were conducted on a num- 
ber of different soils throughout Alabama 
to study the effect of stands of kudzu 
plowed down on the subsequent yields 
of corn. In most cases kudzu had been 



on the land for four years or longer. The 
stands were plowed down and corn was 
planted in 1940. The first year's results 
are shown in table 6 together with the 
yield of corn before kudzu was planted. 
These data show increases in corn yields 
ranging from 10 to 36 bushels per acre 
with an average increase for all tests 
of 23 bushels per acre. Recovery of the 
kudzu on the land after the corn was laid 
by was fair to good in all but one test. 

CONTROL OF KUDZU 

Since kudzu is a very vigorous growing 
plant that under favorable conditions will 
spread rapidly over an area, the idea has 
developed that it could easily become a 
pest that would be very difficult to con- 
trol after it had established itself well. 
It would offer some difficulty on areas

healed the gully from erosion and now furnishes excellent grazing for cattle. 



that could not be plowed, grazed or mow- 
ed. However those experienced in hand- 
ling it know that under field conditions 
it is not a difficult problem to eradicate. 
Generally one or two years of continuous 
heavy grazing will destroy an established 
stand of kudzu. On land suitable for 
cultivation an established stand can be 
destroyed in one year by plowing and 
planting a clean cultivated row crop. 
Frequent mowing weakens a stand the 
same as heavy gazing, and if practiced 
will exhaust the roots to the extent that 
the stand will be destroyed. Numerous 
reports give evidence that kudzu can be 
easily controlled or confined to a definite 
area such as a terrace, by clean cultivation 
of adjacent areas. This prevents vines 
from rooting at the nodes and does not 
allow it to become established. 
INSECTS AND DISEASES 
While there have been no reports as 



yet of loss of kudzu stands by insects or 
diseases, some rather serious injuries have 
occurred and it may be well to be fam- 
iliar with some that are known to attack 
kudzu. As its use becomes more wide- 
spread there is greater possibility of en- 
countering some problems with insects 
and diseases. 

The plant is susceptible to nematodes 
which cause a condition on the roots com- 
monly called root knot. It is a small eel- 
like worm that is a serious pest on some 
crops, although it has not been known to 
kill stands of kudzu. Some trouble has 
been encountered in Mississippi in estab- 
lishing stands with nematode-infected 
crowns. Poor stands are likely to result 
from planting nematode-infected plants 
or planting on nematode-infested soil. 
Plantings should not be made on soils 
that are known to be infested. It would 
be wise to observe carefully the roots of

purchased plants to make sure that they 
are not infected with nematodes. 

Grasshoppers sometimes attack kudzu 
but they are not Hkely to cause serious 
damage. Heavy infestations may give 
the leaves a very ragged appearance but 
unless the attack comes late in the fall, 
a new crop of foliage will be produced 
before frost. 

The velvetbean caterpillar attacks kud- 
zu as well as several other leguminous 
plants. Serious infestations on kudzu oc- 
curred in the fall of 1943 in southern Mis- 
sissippi according to a report made by 
Clay Lyle (9). Fields of kudzu may be 
stripped of their leaves when heavy in- 



festations occur- The caterpillar is a 
tropical or subtropical insect which 
moves northward through Florida and 
Texas each year, usually reaching Missis- 
sippi in late summer or early fall. When 
full-grown the caterpillar is about 1.5 
inches long, greenish or blackish in color 
and has several narrow, light stripes ex- 
tending full length along its back and 
sides. Its general appearance is similar 
to the leafworm or "armyworm" on cot- 
ton. The safest and most economical con- 
trol is dusting with cryolite at 7 to 12 
pounds per acre. The material does not 
burn the plants and it is not dangerous 
for livestock on pastures or hay. 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 438

Bacterial halo blight of kudzu has been 
observed on some stands of kudzu in 
Mississippi. In 1946 infections were ob- 
served on stands in the Holly Springs area 
and were estimated to cause a loss of 10 
to 15 percent of the hay crop. This dis- 
ease was first described by Hedges (10) 
in Georgia in 1928. It occurs on the 
leaves, leaf petioles, and vines of the plant. 
The early symptoms of the disease are 
very small spots bordered by a pale yel- 
lowish halo one-fourth to one inch in 
diameter. Several spots on a leaflet may 



cause the entire leaflet to become chlorotic 
(pale yellowish color) and more or less 
drawn and deformed. In the latter stages 
of a heavy infection the leaves die and 
drop from the plant. Damp and rainy 
weather creates ideal conditions for de- 
velopment of the disease. It may be 
spread on seed or on vegetative parts of 
the plant such as on crowns or in hay. 
Investigations are now underway by the 
Mississippi Experiment Station to find 
a strain of kudzu resistant to the disease.

FENCE POSTS: PRODUCTION 
AND TREATING COSTS 




Good fencing is necessary on modern farms. The one above was constructed with fence posts 
treated in the fence post preservative treatment research program at State College, 



MISSISSIPPI STATE COLLEGE 

AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION 

CLARENCE DORMAN, Director 
STATE COLLEGE MISSISSIPPI 



Fence post supplies in Mississippi are entirely inadequate to meet a 
demand, estimated to be 6,000,000 posts per year for the next two decades. 
If we are to avoid excessively high costs of post replacement resulting from 
the use of non-durable posts, some preservative treatment is a necessity. 

Any such treatment must be simple but effective. In any case it must 
be inexpensive. Results of the work at Mississippi State College in 1946 
indicate that there are two methods and two preservatives which meet 
these specifications. 

Zinc Chloride, applied by the steeping method will give a post at a 
cost of 2 6/10 cents per year. 

Pentachlorophenol, applied by a cold soaking method will give a post 
costing not over 2 2/10 cents per year. 

Farmers may economically use either of these methods which require 
no special equipment. 

There seems to be some possibility of the development of small com- 
munity treating plants to serve areas as large as a county. More investiga- 
tions on this phase of post treatment are necessary. 

Caution. All preservatives are more or less poisonous. Cattle should 
be excluded from the vicinity of the farm treating plant and reasonable care 
must be exercised by persons using wood preservatives.

FENCE POSTS: PRODUCTION AND TREATING COSTS 

By W. C. HOPKINS 



Farmers and other users of fence posts, 
located in regions or states devoid of 
naturally durable tree species, have al- 
ways been without a simple, but satis- 
factory method of treating these fence 
posts. This has come about, not because 
of lack of research work on the prob- 
lems, but simply because the known, ef- 
fective preservatives have not been of 
a nature which lends itself to simple 
treating methods. Within the past ten 
years new preservatives and new proces- 
ses have been developed, some of which 
seem to give promise of simple, econom- 
ical use by farmers. 

In order to be suitable for farmer ap- 
plication a preservative must be relatively 
easy to use, must require no elaborate or 
expensive equipment, and must not in- 
volve any work which has to be done 
at the farmer's busy season. These are 
rigid specifications which heretofore have 
ruled out almost every preservative and 
every method of treating. 

The famous hot and cold bath method 
so widely discussed and the chief basis 
for U.S.D.A. Farmers' Bulletin No. 744,^ 
is virtually eliminated from any considera- 
tion by these specifications. Other much 
talked about treatments such as the tire 
tube method,^ ^ are not satisfactory if 
any number of fence posts are to be 
treated. The application of the preserva- 
tive although seemingly simple, is time 
consuming. 

Two factors made a study of the various 
treating methods of great importance to 
the farmers of Mississippi. First, there 
is only a very small area of the state which 
has tree species naturally durable enough 
to make satisfactory fence posts. Second, 
it is now apparent that a more diversified 
type of agriculture, requiring a much 
greater amount of fencing, will soon be 
prevalent in the state. This interacts with 
the scarcity of suitable fence post species to 
create a necessity for a simple, economical 
treatment. 



Wood is subject to attack by two 
agencies which cause deterioration. Fungi 
actually grow on the wood fibers, break- 
ing them down by chemical action and 
utilizing them for food. Insects too. 
use wood for food, but the action of 
destruction is mechanical. Both agencies 
thrive best in a moist atmosphere, but 
both also require air, food, and certain 
temperatures. In the moist warm climate 
of Mississippi, conditions are favorable 
to these destructive organisms. 

Since we cannot control the conditions 
of temperature or air, any attempts at 
preservative treatment must be concerned 
with poisoning the food supply and re- 
ducing the moisture content of the wood. 
Oil preservatives usually aim at both of 
these objectives, whereas the water solu- 
ble preservatives deal primarily with 
poisoning. 

The species of wood which are by na- 
ture resistant to the attacks of insects and 
fungi possess this characteristic because 
they contain large amounts of heartwood 
which has in it natural oils that not only 
resist penetration by water, but which are 
also toxic. 

FENCE POST REQUIREMENTS AND 
SUPPLY IN MISSISSIPPI 

Normal annual consumption of fence 
posts in Mississippi is between 3.5 and 
4 million posts. The accumulated, war- 
postponed fencing of the past five years 
will easily boost requirements for the 
next three years to 6 million per year. 
When the factor of diversification of 
farm enterprise is taken into account, it 
appears that this requirement of 6 million 
posts per year will continue for some 
time, possibly as much as 20 years. A 
further demand on our supply is being 
made by out-of-state markets. At present 
posts of durable species are being shipped 
in carload quantities to middle-western 
states which have no fence post supply. 
Presumably, this demand will continue 
and possibly will increase as wire and

staples become available and war-deferred 
fencing programs get under way. 

Mississippi's resource of natural fence 
posts is very limited. Five species: Bois 
D'Arc, black locust, red cedar, red mul- 
berry, and old growth cypress are the only 
durable woods remaining in any quantity 
and they are found in numbers only lo- 
cally. 

Bois D'Arc was formerly found widely 
scattered over the delta and black belt 
sections as hedge fences, but most of 
these have been grubbed out until it is 
now confined almost entirely to the black 
belt section of the state. Black locust is 
native to Mississippi only on the Pontotoc 
Ridge. Although it has been very widely 
planted over the state, it has been almost 
a complete failure on the pine soils, con- 
sequently only a small supply is available. 
Red cedar, while scattered throughout the 
state, is present in quantity only on the 
Ume soils of northeast Mississippi. Red 
mulberry occurs throughout the state on 
rich soils but is abundant in no locality. 
The supply of this species is so small as 
to be of minor importance in meeting 
the requirements. Cypress is found in 
relatively small quantities only in the 
delta section and in river bottoms. 

The region of greatest concentration ot 
these satisfactory fence post species is the 
very area which should see the greatest 
diversification of farming. As a result, 
many of the posts produced within the 
region will be used right there. There 
will be very few for export to other sec- 
tions of the state. 

The need, over much of Mississippi, 
for a simple, efficient means of prolong- 
ing the life of a fence post is obvious. 
The native durable woods give service 
from 15 to 30 years, but few others will 
last six years. Many posts being placed 
in service have a life expectancy of not 
more than two or three years. Fence 
post replacement involves far more than 
the cost of the post. The costs of setting 
and nailing on the fence, in the case of 
the cheap non-durable posts so widely 



used, equals or exceeds the cost of the 
post. Every time a farmer sets a pine 
post and puts a fence on it, he spends 
about 20 cents. 

These posts will last no more than 
three years. In fifteen years, therefore, 
he spends one dollar. A pine post given 
a good treatment with one of the more 
recently developed preservatives, penta- 
chlorophenol, should last 20 years at a cost 
of forty-three cents. This cost includes 
ten cents for placement and fastening the 
wire. The untreated post, then, costs 
6-2/3 cents a year, whereas the treated 
post costs only 2-1/6 cents a year. Four 
and one-half cents per post per year 
amounts to considerable saving, even on 
a small farm. 

Great opportunities for utilization of 
many of the inferior hardwood species 
exist in the field of fence post treatment. 
Experiments at Mississippi State College 
during 1946 have definitely proven that 
species such as elm, red gum, water oak, 
blackjack oak, and post oak, can be treat- 
ed efficiently. Service records on these 
posts are not yet available, nor will they 
be for a long period of time. Ten year 
service records on pine posts treated with 
the same preservatives _are available, how- 
ever, and these posts are standing up re- 
markably well. 

It now appears possible to treat almost 
anything in the woods and make a good 
post of it. This is a very important con- 
sideration because it helps to relieve the 
demand on the few durable woods we 
have, conserves pine posts which are 
more valuable if left to grow to larger 
size, and helps us develop a system of 
cutting in our woodlands which will be 
an aid in controlling the encroachment of 
hardwoods. 

PREPARATION OF POSTS 
FOR TREATMENT 

In all but one of the treatment meth- 
ods to be discussed in detail in the next 
section, some pre-treatment preparation 
of the posts is necessary. The two steps

of this preparation are peeling and sea- 
soning. 

Peeling 

Peeling, or removal of all bark from 
the post, is one of the most expensive op- 
erations in connection with fence post 
treatment. Unfortunately, it is also a 
very necessary operation. Preservatives, 
ordinarily, will not penetrate even the 
thin inner bark of trees, so that all bark, 
both outer and inner, must be removed 
from each post to be treated. Many tools 
have been used to do this job and each 
has its proponents. Most used in Mis- 
sissippi, probably, is an old hoe, straight- 
ened out and ground down on the cut- 
ting edge so that a concave edge is ob- 
tained. In use, this tool is pushed along 
the log or post, removing a narrow strip 
of bark in the process. 

A tool recently developed at the Mis- 
sissippi Agricultural Experiment Station 
seems to be somewhat better.- This tool 
was made from the tip of the blade of 



an old round pointed shovel, ground con- 
cave on the cutting edge and fitted with 
a handle. It too, is used as a push tool, 
but has an advantage over the hoe in 
greater weight and more rigid construc- 
tion. Another tool was constructed from 
the top half of the shovel blade and it 
also appears to be more satisfactory than 
the hoe. These three tools are shown in 
figure 1. 

Peeling is most easily done in the 
spring and early summer when the sap 
is flowing more freely in the trees. The 
bark is loose at this time and is easily 
removable from most species of trees. 
However, this is the farmer's busy season 
and it is not expected that many will be 
able to fit this phase of post preparation 
into an already crowded time budget. 
Delayed peeling seems to have some pos- 
sibilities. This method involves stack- 
ing the posts with the bark on for some 
time before attempting to remove the 
bark. Drying coupled with the activities

of some bark insects loosens the bark 
so that it comes off with comparatively 
little effort. Use of this method enables 
the farmer to cut his posts late in the 
summer or early in the fall and then re- 
move the bark from seasoned posts a 
short time prior to treating. Post prep- 
aration and treating may then become 
winter activities which will not serious- 
ly hamper other work. 

Seasoning 

Several of the treating methods to be 
discussed, including the one which seems 
most promising, require that the posts 
be well seasoned or dried prior to applica- 
tion of the treatment. Good seasoning re- 
quires that the posts be piled and allowed 
to dry for 60 to 120 days, depending up- 
on the time of year. Posts seasoned dur- 
ing the summer will dry more rapidly 
than those seasoned during the winter. 

Proper piling is necessary if posts are 
to be seasoned without incurring attack 



by decay causing organisms. An open 
pile, so constructed that air will circulate 
freely around each post is best. The bot- 
tom of the pile should be raised at least 
a foot from the ground. Such a pile is 
illustrated in figure 2. Another method 
of piling, not so desirable, is shown in 
figure 3. 

Posts should never be closely piled, or 
piled on the ground for seasoning. The 
large amounts of moisture present in the 
ground and in the posts create optimum 
conditions for the incidence of decay or- 
ganisms. An illustration of very poor 
seasoning practice is shown in figure 4. 

As posts season, cracks and checks de- 
velop on the surface. It is important that 
all checking take place prior to treat- 
ment because checks which develop after 
treatment may expose untreated wood 
and form an entrance for decay. Check- 
ing could be so severe as to detract from 
the nail-holding characteristics of the post. 



FENCE POSTS: PRODUCTION AND TREATING COSTS 



7 



If seasoning is to be done during the hot 
summer months and it is suspected that 
checking may be severe, the posts may be 
piled for seasoning in the shade where 
they will dry less rapidly. 

Although there are no data to prove its 
value, it is recommended, without excep- 
tion, that the tops of all posts be sharpen- 
ed to a sharp edge with an axe. This gives 
the post a sloping roof which sheds water 
and prevents decay from the top. The 
smoothest saw cut is not satisfactory be- 
cause it leaves a fuzzy surface which will 
retain some water. An axe cut, on the 
other hand, gives a very smooth surface. 
The operation should be performed after 
seasoning in order that no end checks will 
develop and prior to treating so that the 
superficial top treatment to be recom- 
mended will coat the cut surface. 

Posts may be cut at any season of the 
year if properly cared for. As a rule, 
on the farm, they will be cut during 
the fall and winter. In any case, they 



should be piled to season immediately 
following cutting. 

METHODS OF PRESERV- 
ATIVE TREATMENT 

Wood preservatives fall into two gen- 
eral categories: (1), the oil or oil soluble 
preservatives and (2) the water soluble 
preservatives. Each has its uses and for 
some purposes the water soluble preserva- 
tives are quite satisfactory. It is felt 
that the oily chemicals will prove far 
superior for fence post treating in a 
climatic region which has as high annual 
rainfall as does Mississippi. It may well 
be that the service records will prove that 
we can obtain satisfactory treatments with 
some of the water soluble salts. 

The Mississippi Agricultural Experi- 
ment Station began an experiment on 
preservatives and methods of application 
early in 1946. At that time it was de 
cided to use two of the oil preservatives, 





Figure 3.

two of the soluble salts, and one which 
is a combination of the two. These pres- 
ervatives were to be applied by different 
methods to five different species of posts 
— pine, red gum, red oak, post oak, and 
elm. Thirty posts of each species were 
to be treated by each method and each 
post was to be numbered and placed in 
service in the Dairy Department fences. 

The first phase of the study, that in- 
volving the collection of data on costs of 
cutting, preparing, and treating, is now 
complete. Certain inferences as to ex- 
pected service from posts in each treat- 
ment may be drawn from service records 
at other places. 

It is felt that a publication embodying 
complete descriptions of each method of 
treatment and comparing costs of treat- 
ments may be of value at this time. At 
least one of the methods of treatment to 
be discussed below has much to recom- 



mend it to the farmer who has to treat 
fence posts. 

Oil Preservatives 

Hot and Cold Bath, Creosote 

For a good many years the standard 
method of applying oil preservatives on 
a small scale has been by using a hot 
and cold bath plant. This involves im- 
mersion of the posts in a bath of hot 
preservative for several hours, removal 
from the hot bath, and immediate trans- 
fer to the cold preservative bath for a pe- 
riod of an hour or so. The principle un- 
derlying this method of treatment is the 
fact that a partial vacuum is created 
within the hot post when it is plunged 
into the cold preservative and ordinary 
atmospheric pressure forces the preserva- 
tive into the wood. 

Creosote, both pure and in mixture 
with other oils such as used crankcase 



FENCE POSTS: PRODUCTION AND TREATING COSTS 9 



oil, has been the standard preservative 
for use with this method. This preserva- 
tive, in small lots, is expensive and it is 
not very pleasant to handle or vi^ork 
around, especially when hot. 

A considerable investment in a treat- 
ing plant is necessary, too. The experi- 
mental treating plant at State College was 
built at a cost of $200.00, and it is close 
to the minimum operable size. A picture 
of this plant is shown in figure 5. 

The plant requires two tanks at least 
four feet deep. This automatically rules 
out the 55 gallon oil drums which are 
most readily available. 100 gallon oil 
drums would serve, but cannot be found. 
The tanks in the plant pictured were 
secured by buying a 500-gallon oil tank 
and cutting it in half. This gave 2 tanks 
of 250 gallon capacity. Beneath one tank 
a furnace must be constructed for the 



purpose of heating the creosote. The 
furnace need not be elaborate, but should 
be almost as large as the diameter of the 
tank and works best if rough grates are 
constructed- The flue will be safer if 
led away from the tank underground for 
several feet before being turned up. This, 
too, gives adequate room to work about 
the tank. The tanks must either be set 
up on a bank or a ramp must be built 
up alongside them to facilitate handling 
the posts. 

In figure 5 it will be noted that the 
two tanks are set down in the ground, 
the hot tank on the left of the picture 
being slightly higher than the cold tank 
on the right. A pole rack leads up to the 
hot tank, extends between the two tanks, 
and then leads away from the cold tank. 
This facilitates handling of the posts be- 
tween the tanks. If a roof is to be con- 




Figure 5. Experimental Post Treating Plant at State College, Miss

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 439 



structed over the tanks, it should be, at 
the lowest point, six feet above the top 
of the tank. 

Older bulletins have advised that a 
rack with projecting screws or nails 
should be placed in the bottom of the 
tanks. Posts, impaled on these nails or 
screws, would then remain immersed. 
The work here has proven that posts can 
be held immersed to half of their length 
without such a device. Most of them are 
heavy enough to stay down and the few 
which persist in rising a few inches can 
either be wedged between other posts or 
held down with a brick or small rock 
laid on top of them. 

In operation the plant is simple. A 
good fire is built beneath the hot tank 
which has been filled to a depth of two 
feet with pure creosote or creosote and 
used crankcase oil in the proportion of 
1 to 1. The oil in this tank is heated 
to a temperature of 220° to 240° Fahren- 
heit. Meantime, 30 or 40 posts have 
been placed on the rack leading to the hot 
tank and the cold tank has been filled 
with pure creosote to a depth of two 
feet. 

When the temperature reaches 220' 
Fahrenheit, posts are placed in the tank, 
butt end down, one at a time until no 
more can be gotten in or until the level 
of the oil in the tank rises to within six 
inches of the top. Care must be taken 
not to splash the oil over onto the fire. 
The time is noted so that after two hours 
have elapsed, the posts may be removed. 
An ordinary candy thermometer may be 
used to determine the temperature of 
the oil. The oil in the cold tank should 
have a temperature of about 100° Fahren- 
heit and if treating is being done during 
the winter, it may be necessary to add 
some hot oil from the hot tank. 

After two hours have elapsed, the posts 
are removed from the hot tank and trans- 
Icrred at once to the cold tank, where 
they should remain for a period of time 
which may vary from 15 minutes to 1 
hour. Treating schedules (length of 



time required in each tank) indicated by 
the experiments at State College are 
shown in table 1.

Actually, all posts were treated on a 
schedule of 2 hours hot bath and one hour 
cold bath. The desired objective was an 
absorption of 6 pounds of creosote per 
cubic foot of wood, which translated to 
terms of posts mean an absorption of 3 
pounds per post since each post was 
treated only half length and since each 
post averaged about one cubic foot in 
volume. The average absorptions ob 
tained are shown in table 2. Table 1 haj- 
been constructed by applying the author's 
best judgment to the absorptions actualh 
obtained on the 2-1 schedule. 

Absorptions were obtained by measur 
ing the depth in inches of the creosote in 
the cold tank immediately after placing 
the posts in it and just prior to removing 
the posts from it. The latter, subtracted 
from the former gives the number of 
inches change in depth, and this multiplied 
by the number of gallons represented b} 
one inch of depth of tank, gives the gal- 
lons absorbed. This is easily translated 
to pounds by weighing one gallon of the 
preservative. The average absorption 
was then obtained by dividing the num 
her of pounds absorbed by the number 
of posts in the charge. 

If species of posts other than those list- 
ed are to be treated by this method, a 
few trial batches should be run at dif- 
ferent schedules to determine which is 
best. Ordinarily, six pounds of creosote 
per cubic foot of wood will give a very 
satisfactory fence post.

In this, as in all tests at the college, 
half of the posts were also given a super- 
ficial, top treatment which consisted sim- 
ply of dipping the top half of the post 
in the cold creosote a sufficiently long 
time to insure coating it with the pres- 
ervative. Although data to substantiate 
the concept of top failure are lacking, it 
is recommended that such a top treat- 
ment be given in all instances. Because 
the top of the post is not subjected to long 
periods of dampness as is the bottom, 
the more effective hot and cold bath 
treatment does not seem necessary. 

DIP METHOD— CREOSOTE 

Creosote has been used and is still be 
ing used in a simple dipping or brushing 
process. This may afford sufficient pro 
tection for- wood not in contact with the 
ground or not subjected to a great amount 
of moisture for considerable periods ol 
time. For fence posts, however, it rep^ 
resents a waste of time and money simply 
because there is no absorption of the oil 
and the thin outer coat is ineffective in 
preventing absorption of water and en 
trance of decay causing organisms. 

The method consists of simply dipping 
the post for an hour or so in warm creo- 
sote, or in painting warm creosote on 
the surface of the post with a brush. Posts 
held for two hours in a very hot bath of 
creosote absorbed no appreciable amounts 
of the preservative. 

A comparison of the penetration ob- 
tained by the hot and cold bath method 
as against the dipping method is shown 
in figure 6. 

PENTACHLOROPHENOL 

Within the past ten years a new chem- 
ical, pentachlorophenol, has come into 



the wood preservative field. Now coming 
onto the market in fair quantities, under 
various trade names, and put out by sev- 
eral chemical companies,--^ it holds great 
promise of becoming one of the most eas- 
ily applied and most satisfactory wood 
preservatives. Although tests thus far 
are not comprehensive enough and serv- 
ice records are not long enough to prove 
conclusively the value of this preservative, 
it is 10 to 100 times as toxic as creosote 
and much easier to use. 

Pentachlorophenol is available in eith- 
er a dry flake or concentrated solution 
form. Tn most cases the concentrated 
solution will be somewhat easier to use. 
Soluble in very thin petroleum oils, it 
has much the same property as water in 
that it will penetrate wood very rapidly 
and easily. While it may also be applied 
by the hot and cold bath method, there 
are much simpler methods which will 
give an effective fence post treatment. 
In the experiments which form the basis 
of this report it was applied by both the 
hot and cold bath and the cold soaking 
methods. The preservatives used in these 
experiments were contributed by A. D. 
Chapman and Co., and Wood Treating 
Chemicals Co.

employed. Due to the very dangerous 
inflammability of the solution of penta- 
chlorophenol in ordinary kerosene, hot 
water was substituted in the hot tank. 
A five percent solution of pentachloro- 
phenol was placed in the cold tank. The 
water was much more difficult to heat 
to the desired temperature and hold there, 
so it was decided to hold the posts in 
the hot tank between three and four 
hours. At the end of this time the posts 
were immediately transferred to the cold 
tank where they remained for one hour. 
The average absorptions obtained by this 
treatment are shown in table 3. 

The Forest Products Laboratory ^ " says 
that at least one-half gallon of preserva- 
tive per post must be retained to give 
a good treatment. This, however, ap- 
plies to posts treated full length. The 
posts in this experiment were treated only 
half length so that retention between

half of the posts were subjected to a one 
hour dip treatment of the top end, the 
others not being treated. 

The use of hot water in the hot bath 
seems to have no deleterious effect on 
the absorption of preservative. This is 
probably due to the fact that most of the 
water taken up by the posts in the hot 
bath is in the form of steam when the 
posts are removed from the hot bath.

preservative condenses this steam and

the preservative into the wood. 
Cold Soaking Method 

Water and thin oil solutions are very 
readily soaked up by dry wood. This 
fact makes possible the use of a simple 
method of treating fence posts with penta- 
chlorophenol solutions. The only equip- 
ment necessary is a tank or drum which 
will permit submerging the post to a 
point 8 or 12 inches above the ground 
line. Dry posts left in this solution for 
5 to 24 hours will absorb amounts of pres- 
ervative equal to that absorbed in the 
hot and cold bath process. 

Absorptions obtained by this method 
at State College are given in table 4. 

In the pentachlorophenol tests a 5 per- 
cent solution was used. This was ob- 
tained by mixing the concentrated solu- 
tion of pentachlorophenol with ordinary 
kerosene in the proportions advised by 
the manufacturers. Other light petrol- 
eum oils such as diesel fuel oil are less 
expensive and should be used when avail- 
able. 

This cold soaking treatment has much 
to recommend it. It involves very little 
expenditure of labor in the actual treat- 
ing process since it is quite possible 
for a farmer to place a batch of posts 
in the preservative in the morning, go 
away and work all day at something else, 
and remove the posts that night. If he 
were treating by the hot and cold bath 
method, he would have to stay close by 
to maintain the fire. 

The experiments at the college have 
shown that it is possible to obtain absorp- 
tions with this method fully equal to 
those obtained by use of the hot and cold 



bath. As a matter of fact, absorptions 
equal to those generally obtained in pres- 
sure treating fence posts are possible. 
The pentachlorophenol solutions used at 
the college were about six cents cheaper 
per gallon than the creosote. If some 
solvent other than kerosene were used, 
a saving of ten cents a gallon might be 
effected. Due to the fact that absorption 
is much faster with some species than 
others, as shown by Table 4, each specie 
should be treated separately. This is true 
of all treating methods. Penetrations ob- 
tained in the cold soaking treatment are 
shown in figure 7. 

Water Soluble Preservatives 

Research in the field of wood preserva- 
tion has been done on water soluble 
chemicals for many years. Some of the 
most promising of these chemicals have 
been in use as wood preservatives in 
arid regions for long periods of time. In 
such regions they have given good re- 
sults, simply because the treated wood 
was not subjected to water in sufficient 
amounts to wash the chemicals out. Even 
in very moist climates, the record on at 
least one such chemical is sufficiently 
good to warrant its use, especially since 
the process is so simple and the chemical 
so inexpensive that a very low cost post 
results. Certainly this one treatment is 
better than none. 

The water soluble chemicals and meth- 
ods of application to be discussed here 
are those which have been used in the 
experiments at the college. Again, we 
have no service records here to indicate 
the expected life of these posts. We are, 
however, able to compare the costs of the 
various chemicals and draw certain in- 
ferences from service tests elsewhere.

CHROMATED ZINC CHLORIDE 

Chromated zinc chloride is an outgrowth 
of one of the most used water soluble 
preservatives, zinc chloride. This chem- 
ical has been used long enough to prove 
that there are excellent possibilities for 
treating with it in arid regions. Experi- 
ments at Clemson, S. C.^ indicate that 
it may be used satisfactorily in more 
moist localities. 

The method of application used here 
has been used in other localities with 
success. A tank or trough twelve or fif- 
teen inches deep with a rack built up 

round it to hold the posts upright, is 
•the only equipment necessary. The 
trough might be placed next to a wall 
or fence and the posts leaned against this 
for support. It is important that the 
treating be done under a shed. Rain- 
water, falling into the trough, will dilute 
the solution and ruin the treatment. 
A solution made by mixing two pounds 



of chromated zinc chloride, with one 
gallon of water, is placed in this tank. 
One-half gallon of solution should be al- 
lowed for each post. Posts should be 
cut and placed in the solution within 
twenty four hours after cutting, large end 
down. The bark must not be removed 
from the posts. If only the amount of 
solution for the number of posts to be put 
in the tank is poured in, the posts should 
be left until all of the solution is absorb- 
ed. If more than enough solution is 
placed in the tank, the number of gal- 
lons absorbed may be measured and the 
posts removed when the average absorp- 
tion reaches one-half gallon per post. 

This absorption may require only a 
few hours, or it may extend over a period 
of a week depending upon the porosity 
of the wood and the rate of drying of 
the top of the post. The solution is pull- 
ed up into the post by capillary action. 
As the post dries at the top, the native 



FENCF POSTS: PRODUCTION AND TREATING COSTS 



15 



liquids are pulled up in the post and 
the preservative solution in turn moves 
up through the pores of the v^ood. 

Upon completion of absorption and re- 
moval from the trough, the posts are 
stood up, top end down, for two to four 
weeks to permit any excess solution in 
the butts to flow down into the top. The 
posts are now ready for placement. 

Chromated zinc chloride and zinc 
chloride may be obtained from any chem- 
ical house.-^ Zinc chloride is slightly less 
expensive and on the basis of service tests 
at the Harrison Experimental Forest, 
somewhat better. This treatment, while 
it will not give as durable posts as oil 
treatments, is very simple, consumes lit- 
tle time, and is inexpensive. It will ef- 
fect considerable saving over the practice 
of no treatment at all. 

THE OSMOSE PROCESS 

The Osmose Wood Preserving Com- 
pany, of Buffalo, New York, has develop- 
ed a process, and patented two preserva- 
tives for use with it, which makes use 
of the principle of osmosis. Osmosis is 
a natural process occurring in plants and 
animals whereby two solutions of differ- 
ent strength separated by a thin mem- 
brane such as a cell wall, tend to equal- 
ize. That is, the chemicals in the strong- 
er solution move through the membrane 
into the weaker solution until there is 
an equal concentration of chemical sub- 
stance on either side of the membrane. 

The application of this process in wood 
preservation consists simply of coating 
the outside of a green post or piece of 
wood with a strong chemical solution and 
then placing the wood under a water- 
proof, more or less airtight cover. Os- 
mosis sets in and over a period of 30 to 
90 days the chemicals placed on the out- 
side of the wood gradually become in- 
corporated. 

Two patented chemical mixtures are 
used for treating posts by this method.-^ 
One is a dry salt which is used to make a 
water solution applied to the post by 



brushing or dipping. The other is a tar 
solution, containing the same chemicals, 
which is applied only to the groundline 
area of the post with a brush. 

Osmosalts 
This is the mixture of chemicals which 
is used to make a water solution to be 
applied by brushing or dipping. The 
mixture used in the experiments at State 
College was 4 parts of water to 3 parts 
of dry chemical. This was applied to the 
posts with a cheap 4-inch paint brush, 
the posts being closely piled as the pres- 
ervative was applied. After all posts 
were piled and treated, the stack was 
covered with waterproof tar paper and 
earth was banked up around the bottom 
to exclude air. The posts remained in 
this stack for 75 days before the cover 
was removed. Good penetration was ob- 
tained on all species. The method of 
piling and preservative application is 
shown in figure 8. Extent of penetration 
is shown in figure 9. 

Posts which are being treated by this 
method must be cut and peeled not over 
twenty-four hours before treatment. This 
is a decided drawback from the farmers' 
standpoint because he cannot always af- 
ford the time during the proper peeling 
season. 

Osmoplastic 

This preservative is applied only to a 
small section of the post about twelve 
inches below groundline and three inches 
above groundline. The posts, which must 
be treated within 24 hours after cutting, 
are brought in with the bark on. The 
bark is then peeled only from the sec- 
tion to be treated and the tarlike solu- 
tion of Osmoplastic painted on heavily 
with a paint brush. A small piece of 
waterproof paper is then wrapped tight -

ly about the treated section of the post 
and tacked in place. The post, ready 
for treatment and after treatment is com- 
pleted, is shown in figure 10. After treat- 
ment the posts should be stood up and 
allowed to dry for 30 days before place- 
ment. 

Service records on posts treated in this 
manner are not sufficiently long to in 
dicate whether or not it will prove eco- 
nomical. 

COSTS OF FENCE POSTS 

In the past much has been written con- 
cerning preservative treatment of fence 
posts without mentioning the various 
items of cost which go into treated and 
untreated fence posts. One of the main 
objectives of the work at State College 
has been to collect data on the man-hour 
requirements of each of the jobs involved 
in harvesting and treating fence posts. 
Since some preservative treatments re- 
quire posts which have been peeled, stack- 
ed and seasoned, others require posts 
peeled but still green, and still others re- 



quire posts green with the bark on, data 
on the separate job of felling and buck- 
ing, peeling, hauling and stacking, is 
desirable. 

Each treatment, too, differs from every 
other in the amount of labor required in 
the process. Some preservatives cost more 
than others and a good post may require 
more of one preservative than another. 
All of these factors become items of 
cost, and cost to the farmer is a very 
important consideration. 

Labor requirements in this study have 
been recorded in terms of man hours so 
that any prevailing wage rate could be 
applied. The work was actually done by 
day labor paid at the rate of forty cents 
per hour. Labor costs in the following 
tables then are obtained by multiplying 
the total man hours expended by the 
hourly rate of forty cents. These costs 
may be adjusted to prevailing wage rates 
in any similar area simply by substitut- 
ing the prevailing hourly rate for the 
hourly rate of forty cents used in these 
tables. 



FENCE POSTS: PRODUCTION AND TREATING COSTS 



17 



No attempt has been made to separate 
the costs by species worked with. Admit- 
tedly, it is less expensive to make posts 
from pine than from any of the other 
species used but it is hoped that hereafter 
a good many fence posts will be harvest- 
ed from the gum, red oak, post oak, elm, 
and other low grade hardwoods. The 
cost figures set forth herein will be ap- 
plicable to these species. 

There is no doubt that all of these 
costs are higher than they would be with 
experienced woods labor. The labor used 
on the project consisted of Negro farm 
hands, most of whom had never done 
any woods work. Peeling was for all of 
them a new task, consequently it was 
accomplished with the expenditure of 
much more time than would be required 
with labor accustomed to peeling. How- 



ever, it was considered desirable, in this 
study, to make use of part time farm 
labor. The study was designed to furn- 
ish information for the farmer and the 
use of trained woods labor would have 
led to a fallacy in the costs which would 
have been misleading. Any farmer with 
his ordinary farm labor can secure his 
posts at a cost not to exceed those set 
up herein. Many men, who have hands 
more accustomed to woods work, will 
obtain their posts at a cost considerably 
less than this. 

Hot and Cold Bath Treatment 

The factors contributing to the costs 
of this method of treating are cost of 
plant, labor cost (including cutting, peel- 
ing, hauling, seasoning and treating), cost 
of preservative, and cost of fuelwood.

*Hauling costs will vary with length of haul and equipment used. In this study the distance 
averaged about one mile. About '/4 of the posts were hauled on a pickup truck, 2/3 of them 
on a 1/4 ton truck and the balance with a team and wagon. 



As mentioned previously, the experi- 
mental plant at Mississippi State College 
cost approximately $200.00. Actual cost 
was $191.50 which is broken down as 
follows: tanks, $28.50 (an old 500 gallon 
gasoline tank cut in half crosswise to 
make two 250-gallon tanks about 4*/4 
feet deep); other materials (roofing, etc.) 
$73.00; labor $50.00; and supervision, 
$40.00. 

The farmer building his own plant 
might not include any cost for supervision. 
If he put no roof over the tank he would 
reduce the labor cost by 50 percent. He 
might then, build a workable plant, with- 
out any shed, for a figure close to $75.00. 
Such a plant is not to be recommended 
since the treating will presumably be 
done in the fall and winter when rain is 
probable. Work can go right on if there 
is a shed over the tanks. 

If we assume a depreciation charge 
of one cent per post and a cost of $200.00 
for the plant, we have to treat 20,000 
posts to pay for the plant. This charge 
for depreciation would probably run clos- 
er to 3 or 4 cents per post. 

The labor cost on posts treated by this 
method is high because of the necessity 
of peeling and of maintaining a fire un- 
der the hot tank all of the time while 
treating. From table 5 the cost per post 
for labor would run between 29 and 31 
cents. 



Preservative cost varies with the pres- 
ervative used. Grade I coal tar creosote 
costs 33-1/3 cents per gallon in 50-gallon 
lots. If the desirable absorption of ^4 
gallon per post (butt treatment only) is 
obtained, the cost per post would bs slight- 
ly over 8 cents per post. When the top is 
then given a dip treatment, the preserva- 
tive cost would approach 9 cents per post. 

Pentachlorophenol (1 to 10 concentrate) 
costs $2.00 per gallon. Mixed with 10 
gallons of kerosene at 10 cents per gallon, 
the cost of 11 gallons of preservative solu- 
tion becomes $3, or 27.2 cents per gallon. 
This cost may be reduced to 23.6 cents 
per gallon by use of diese! fuel at 6 cents 
per gallon, as a solvent. If the desired 
absorption of Ya of a gallon per post is 
obtained, the cost of preservative would 
be about six cents. Here again, the top 
treatment would run the cost per post up 
to about seven cents. 

Considerable fuelwood is consumed in 
heating the hot tank and maintaining it 
at the proper temperature. Some differ- 
ence would occur, dependent upon the 
kind of wood used for fuel and whether 
creosote or water was used in the hot 
tank. About one-half cord of wood per 
hundred posts was used in the experi- 
ments at State College and the cost of 
this wood at the plant was figured at $5 
per cord. Cost of fuel per post then, was 
lYz cents. Three cents is thought to be 
a better figure for the pentachlorophenol

treatment because of the longer time re- 
quired to heat the water and the neces- 
sity of a hotter fire to maintain it at 
the required temperature. 

Some charge for depreciation of equip- 
ment other than the treating plant should 
be made. One cent per post should cov- 
er all expenses other than those discuss- 
ed before. This charge will apply to all 
treatments. 

Table 6 gives a comparison of the cost 
of the hot and cold bath method with 
creosote and with pentachlorophenol. 

It should be emphasized that the cost 
of preservative included in the above 
table is the cost only of the preservative

actually absorbed. This method of treat- 
ment (with tanks the size of those ai 
State College) requires an additional 
seventy gallons of preservative in the cold 
tank. In the case of creosote, where the 
oil is used in the hot tank, another addi- 
tional 100 gallons of preservative is need- 
ed. The initial costs then should be in 
creased as follows: 
Creosote treatment: 

170 gallons creosote at $0,333 = 
156.61 

Pentachlorophenol treatment: 
70 gallons pentachlorophenol 5% 
solution at $0,236 = $16.52. 
There is no way of distributing these 
figures as a cost per post because the 
leftover oils m&y be saved and used again. 
The factor of initial cost, however, is heav-^ 
ily in favor of pentachlorophenol. 

Posts treated with creosote by the Hoi 
and Cold Bath Method are good for 



20 years. It appears likely that penta- 
chlorophenol treated posts will be just as 
good. The cost per post per year will be 
in both cases oniy slightly over two 
cents. 

Creosote Dip Treatment 

This treating method involves labor 
costs of cutting, peeling, hauling, season- 
ing and treating a small cost for pres- 
ervative, and the cost of equipment de- 
preciation. No cost of plant is involved 
because any old drum or barrel may be 
used provided it does not leak and 
will permit submersion to half the length

of the post. Little preservative cost is 
incurred because there is neghgible ab- 
sorpton and penetration. One gallon of 
preservative will easily treat ten posts. 
Table 7 shows a breakdown of the 
costs of treating by dipping in the 
experiments at State College. 

Posts so treated might be expected to 
last five years. The cost per post per 
year, therefore, is slightly over 5 cents 
or 3 cents more than for posts treated by 
the hot and cold bath. The dip treatment 
is little better than no treatment and ii 
involves the same costs of preparation as 
are incurred with the hot and cold bath.

ment with creosote.

Osmose Treatment 

The osmose treatment with Osmosalts 
is more expensive than the hot and cold 
bath or dip methods. The same costs 
of preparation are incurred. No plant is 
necessary, but this saving is more than 
taken up in the labor of treating. The 
preservative is more expensive too, and 
it is doubtful if posts so treated will give 
as long service as creosoted or penta- 
chlorophenol treated posts. A dipping 
process, instead of a brushing process, 
would undoubtedly give much lower costs. 

Table 8 breaks down the cost of the 
brush treatment with osmosalts. For com- 
parative purposes it is assumed that the 
labor involved in dipping would cost the 
same as for dip creosoting and a figure 
which may be valid for dip treatment 
is also given. Some saving of preserva- 
tive would be affected by use of a dip 
method but no attempt to estimate this 
is made. 

The saving in preservative on the dip 
method might run to 5 cents per post. 
Even this much would still mean a cost 
of at least 41 cents per post. For the

brush method the cost per post per year 
would run from 4^2 to seven cents if 
we assume a 10 to 15 year service life 
for these posts. Ten-year service records 
are available which indicate that these 
posts may last longer. 

The Osmoplastic ground-line treatment 
is somewhat less expensive since this meth- 
od does not involve so much labor of 
peeling. The cost break-down on this 
method is as follows in table 9. The 
preservative costs $5.25 per gallon and 
two and one-half gallons were required 
to treat 150 posts. 

Service tests in south Mississippi show 
that some of the posts treated by this 
method have decayed within four years. 
It is believed that a five-year average life 
of such posts will be good under the 
climatic and soil conditions in Missis- 
sippi. This would make the cost six 
cents per post per year.

Chromated Zinc Chloride 
Steeping Treatment 

This method of treatment is one of 
the least expensive of any tested at Mis- 
sissippi State College during 1946. N'o 
cost of peeling enters into the total cost 
and the chemical used is inexpensive. No 
elaborate plant is required either, any 
trough or barrel which will hold 10 or 15 
inches of water being satisfactory. Chro-

mated Zinc Chloride in 50-pound lots 
costs 15 cents per pound and Zinc Chlo- 
ride 1414 cents per pound. Costs of the 
posts treated by the steeping method at 
State College are shown in table 10. 

It will be noted that an average absorp- 
tion of 1.36 pounds of salts per post was 
obtained. If the recommended absorp- 
tion of 1 pound per post had been adhered 
to, preservative cost and total would have 
been reduced five cents. The total would 
then be 26 cents per post. Service tests 
elsewhere indicate that a ten-year average 
life of post may be expected. This would 
give a cost per post per year of 2.6 cents.

Pentachlorophenol Cold 
Soaking Treatment 

AH of the costs of preparation incident 
to the hot and cold bath treatment are 
incurred with this method, but the cost 
of actual treating is somewhat less. Pres- 
ervative costs are about the same, depend- 
ing of course upon how long the posts re- 
main in the solution and how much pres- 
ervative they absorb. Table 11 shows the 
cost of this treatment when absorption 
is held to the desired !4 gallon per post. 

Posts treated in this way may be ex- 
pected to last fully as long as posts treated 
by the hot and cold bath method since 
just as good absorptions are obtained. 
While service records are only ten years 
old, there is every indication of a 20-year 
average life. If posts treated in this man-

ner will last so long, the cost per post per 
year is only one and six-tenths cents. 

Table 12 constitutes a summary and 
comparison of the costs of treating by the 
various methods. 

Community Treating Plants 

Thus far all discussion in this treatise 
has centered about methods of treatment 
and plants which may be used by an in- 
dividual farmer. There is, however, con- 
siderable interest about the state in small 
commercial or cooperative treating enter- 
prises designed to fit the needs of com- 
munities. Without a separate study on 
the needs tor such plants, costs of opera- 
tion, etc., it is hard to make any definite 
recommendations. Some information, 
however, has been collected in connection 
with the other work on treating and may 
be of value to persons interested in these 
small scale treating plants. 

Most Mississippi counties will probably 
support a profitable small plant. A good 
county has 10 or 12 townships each of 
which would require about 100,000 posts 
to divide it into 160 acre lots. If we ac- 
cept the anticipated demand of 6,000,000 
posts a year for the state and divide by 
the number of counties, we arrive at an 
annual county demand for nearly 75,000 
posts. A good efficient plant of the hot 
and cold bath type can probably handle 
about 600 posts per day. If nothing but 
posts were treated in this plant, a demand 
of 180,000 per year would be necessary to 
insure continuous operation. There is no 
reason, however, why all kinds of con- 
struction material, bridge tunbers, etc., 
should not be handled at the same plant. 

Types of Plants Adapted to 
Community Use 

There are almost as many ideas about 
the most suitable type of small scale treat- 
ing plant as there are persons interested 
in such plants. No one, however, (except 
the manufacturers) recommends small 
pressure plants. They undoubtedly give 
superior treatment, but the cost of such a 
plant is excessive and highly trained per-

sonnel is required to operate it. Estimates 
obtained on such plants during the course 
of this investigation ranged from $20,000 
to $75,000. No one would be justified in 
investing so much in a plant to serve only 
a community. 

The only other alternative is some large 
scale adaptation of the hot and cold bath 
plant. The cold soaking process with 
pentachlorophenol would not be satisfac- 
tory because it consumes too much time 
for use in a commercial operation. Con- 
tinuous production is an important fac- 
tor in the economical operation of these 
small plants. 

Georgia's vocational agriculture teach- 
ers have set up and are operating a num- 
ber of community creosoting plants which 
are based on the hot and cold bath process. 
Most of these plants consist of a single 
tank made of reinforced concrete or steel 
plate and heated through coils in the bot- 
tom which carry steam from a gin or 
community cannery. In operation the 
posts are heated in the creosote, the steam 
tucned off and the posts and creosote al- 
lowed to cool together. There are some 
disadvantages to this method, chief of 
which are the facts that absorption is hard- 
er to control and only one charge per day 
can be run through the plant. Their tanks 
are usually 4 feet deep x 4.5 feet wide and 
range in length from 15 to 30 feet. Posts 
are handled by an overhead travelling 
hoist. 

The Delta Branch Experiment Station, 
Stoneville, Mississippi, has an experiment- 
al installation which works on the true 
hot and cold bath principle of two tanks. 
These tanks are semi-circular in cross sec- 
tion, 5 feet wide at the top x 2.5 feet deep 
and about 20 feet long. The tanks are 
placed end to end with about four feet be- 
tween them. A brick, dutch-oven furn- 
ace was constructed under one. A travel- 
ling, overhead hoist is used to pick up 
bundles of posts, place them in the tanks 
and transfer them from one tank to the 
other. With some modification, this de- 



sign appears to be satisfactory for small 
scale community plants. 

A satisfactory plant might consist of 
two rectangular steel tanks 4 feet deep 
by 4 feet wide by 25 feet long, set two 
feet in the ground and heated with 
steam coils. Steam might be supplied 
by a gin or sawmill boiler if available. 
The cold tank should be supplied with 
coils too, so that exhaust steam from the 
hot tank or cold water may be used to 
raise or lower the temperature of the oil 
in the cold bath. Average absorptions 
will be easy to check if a gauge, reading 
in gallons, is installed on the cold tank. 
A thermometer should be placed on the 
hot tank. An overhead, traveling hoist 
should be provided for moving charges, 
and several dollies would be a distinct ad- 
vantage in moving charges to the tanks 
and away from them. Charging the tanks 
would be facilitated if oil storage tanks of 
carload capacity were provided. A shed 
should cover the entire plant. Posts may 
be treated half-length only by providing 
a removable skeletal partition to divide 
each tank into compartments 4x5 feet. 
Some method of exerting pressure to sub- 
merge charges to be treated full length is 
necessary. A hinged rack could be devis- 
ed which would be operated by means of 
cables and pulleys, the power to be furn- 
ished by the overhead hoist. 

Figure 10 and 11 show the diagram- 
matic layout of such a plant. 

An advantageous adjunct to any small 
treating plant would be a small, mechan- 
ical, peeling machine. Several have been 
developed, but the field is still wide open. 
A machine somewhat similar to the pole 
sizing machine in use at large treating 
plants, but on a smaller scale, might be 
satisfactory. 

Costs of Operation 

A very complete plant sufficient to serve 
the needs of a county could be built for 
a cost of $10,000. Such a plant would 
have a hfe of at least 10 years. It would 
have a capacity of at least 600 posts per 



26 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 439 



day. In a year's time, operating 300 days 
out of the year it would treat the equiva- 
lent of 180,000 posts. The plant could be 
operated by three men. Labor costs might 
be 85 cents an hour for the trained oper- 
ator and 65 cents an hour for the other 
two men. A supply of posts, necessary to 
start operations might cost 10 cents each. 
An estimate of the daily and per post 
cost of operation is given in table 13. 

Profit of 3 cents on the post (or post 
equivalent) would return over 50 percent 
of the investment to the operator in a 
year's time. A system whereby the farm- 
er could bring in green, unpeeled posts 
and trade them, paying the difference in 
cash, for treated posts, would be very ad- 
vantageous. 

The best preservative for use in these 
plants will probably be creosote as it is 
somewhat cheaper in carload lots than is 
pentachlorophenol. The cost of preserva- 
tive may be reduced by diluting the oil in 
the hot bath with fuel oil, crank case 
oil, etc., in the proportion of 1 to 1. 

All of the figures and ideas presented 
in this section are theoretical and are 
based on the author's best judgment rath- 



er than on any actual operations. This 
must be borne in mind when attempting 
to use them in any contemplated plant 
construction or operation. The local con- 
ditions with respect to demand for treat- 
ed posts, labor, equipment cost, and op- 
erating costs should be carefully investigat- 
ed. We have merely attempted here to 
outline some of the possibi-Uties.

Breeding and Feeding in Spring Lamb 
} Production 

! By HENRY H. LEVECK 

i 

Profitable lamb production in Mississippi depends to a great ex- 
tent on the ability of producers to have lambs of desirable conforma- 
tion and quality reach ideal market weights and finish in time to sell 
on the April and May markets. 

Lambs coming to market at this time usually find the highest 
prices, due to the public's greater demand for lamb during these 
months, and to the fact that few lambs are finished for market 
at this time. Fed lambs from the corn belt have been marketed in 
previous months, and it is not generally practicable for producers of 
milk fat lambs in the North to have lambs ready for market this 
early in the season. 

The marketing of lambs during April and May offers three other 
advantages for Mississippi producers. In the first place, it is easier 
to maintain bloom on lambs before the weather becomes too warm. 
Secondly, lambs take full advantage of our good spring clover pas- 
tures, directly as feed for themselves, and indirectly as feed to encour- 
age their dams in milk production. Thirdly, lambs are marketed 
before the warm weather build-up of parasites, thereby eliminating 
many parasitic troubles that one would have to combat in marketing 
later in the summer. 

This bulletin includes the results of four tests which have been 
completed by the Mississippi Experiment Station to study some of 
the most important factors influencing the economical production of 
high quality spring lambs. It is arranged in four parts: 

Part 1. Grain supplement in the production of spring lambs 
on good pasture. 

Part 2. A study of the influence of type and breeding in spring 
lamb production. 

Part 3. The value of Corriedale, Hampshire, and Southdown 
breeding in spring lamb production. 

Part 4. Northwestern, Southwestern, and Corriedale-native ewes 
in wool and spring lamb production.

PART I 

Grain Supplement In the 
Production of Lambs on 
Good Pasture* 

Does it pay to feed grain to lambs on 
good pasture? This question is often 
asked by producers of milk fat lambs 
in Mississippi. 

The demand for well finished lambs 
is evident by the ''spread" or difference 
in the market value of choice, good, and 
medium grades of lambs. Finish, at de- 
sirable market w^eight, early in the year, 
are perhaps the three most important 
factors in spring lamb production. The 
importance of these factors prompted 
this study to determine the influence of 
grain feeding on the rate of gain and 
finish of lambs being produced to market 
at weaning time. 

The general objective of this test was 
to study the influence of supplementing 
pasture with grain, both when fed to 
the lambs and when fed to the ewes, on 
the rate of gain of lambs, the degree of 
finish at time of slaughter, and the quali- 
ty and palatability of the meat produced. 
The following lots were compared: 

Lot 1. Pasture alone for ewes and 
lambs. 

Lot 2. Pasture for ewes and lambs, 
and the lambs creep-fed cot- 
tonseed meal. 

Lot 3. Pasture for the ewes and 
lambs, and the lambs creep- 
fed a mixture of corn, oats, 
and wheat bran. 

Lot 4, Pastures for both ewes and 
lambs, and the ewes fed a 
daily ration of 3/4 pound 
of corn and 1/4 pound of 
cottonseed meal. (This lot 
was used during 1929 and 
1931, and the results were 
used in this study to de- 
termine the possibility of 
increasing the milk flow of 
the ewes by grain feeding. 



thereby increasing ihe rate 
of gain and finish at mar- 
ket time of the lambs.) 

Methods Used in Test 

The lambs used in each of these tests 
were out of native, first cross, second 
cross, and high grade Southdown ewes. 
All ewes were handled as a group, other 
than during the time the lambs were on 
test. On June 1 of each year, lambs 
that had not previously been removed 
from their dams were removed and sold 
or put in a separate pasture and retained 
for flock replacements. The ewes were 
watched for 8 or 10 days and ewes pro- 
ducing large quantities of milk were 
milked to prevent spoiled udders. The 
ewes were then placed on good pasture, 
largely of dallis and Bermuda grass, ap- 
proximately 90 percent dallis grass, where 
they remained until July 1. 

The pasture used during the month of 
June was of sufficient quality to cause 
the ewes to gain from 6 to 8 pounds 
each, which is considered sufficient gain 
in weight to serve as a "flush". This 
flushing tends to speed up conception 
and to result in an increased number of 
twin lambs being produced. 

On July 1 purebred Southdown rams 
were turned in with the flock. The rams 
were left with the ewes until approxi- 
mately October 1. The ewes remained 
on pasture until December 1 when lamb- 
ing began, and the flock was moved to 
winter quarters where oat pasture was 
provided. During the breeding season 
and prior to lambing time (July 1 to 
December 1) the ewes were kept on per- 
manent pasture where an abundance of 
forage was available at all times. The 
plants present were largely dallis grass 
with a small amount of Bermuda grass. 

*This project was conducted in cooperation 
with Bureau of Animal Industry, United States 
Department of Agriculture, as one of the in- 
vestigations in the cooperative projects, "A Study 
of the Factors which Influence the Quality and 
Palatability of Meat." Only the production phases 
are given m this report. 



BREEDING AND FEEDING IN SPRING LAMB PRODUCTION 



5 



The ewes were corralled in a dog-proof 
•corral each night. They had access to 
salt and clean pond water. Internal par- 
asites were controlled by drenching the 
ewes once every two weeks with four 
ounces of a one percent solution of cop- 
per sulphate. This method of controlling 
internal parasites has been replaced by the 
more easily administered Phenothiazine- 
salt mixture. 

Cattle and sheep were run together 
on the same pasture with no noticeable 
ill effect to the cattle or sheep. It was 
felt that the pasture was improved for 
grazing by the cattle, as the sheep's pref- 
erence for a variety of forage caused 
them to consume many weeds that were 
unpalatable to cattle, thereby enabling 
more desirable plants to grow. 

The lambs used were yeaned largely 
in December and January. Previous to 
the initial date of the experiment the 
lambs with their dams had free access 
to a limited amount of oat pasture. In 
addition to the oat pasture the ewes were 
fed 1/2 pound of cottonseed meal and 
1 1 /3 pound nf lohnson grass hay. As 
long as there was an abundance of oat 
pasture the ewes refused approximately 
60 percent of this hay. Ewes and lambs 
had access to salt and to deep well water. 
No parasite treatment was given during 
this time. Both ewes and lambs were 
housed in an open shed type barn. The 
period in winter quarters extended from 
approximately December 1 to March 15. 

The lambs were put on test at the 
start of the pasture season, approximately 
March 20, when the lambs averaged 40 
pounds, and continued on test until the 
lambs averaged approximately 70 pounds 
liveweight. The permanent pasture used 
during the period of the test consisted of 
wild barley, bur clover, yellow hop clo- 
ver, white clover, Kentuckv blue grass, 
Bermuda and dallis grass; yellow hop clo- 
ver furnished approximately 75 percent 
of the forage during this period. Both 
water and salt were available at all times. 

During the test period the lambs were 



drenched once every two weeks with a 
one percent copper sulphate solution. 
Each lamb received 1 1/2 ounces of this 
solution at 40 pounds liveweight, and 
an additional 1/2 ounce for each 10 
pound mcrease in liveweight until a four 
ounces dose was given. This method was 
found satisfactory for controlling stom- 
ach worms in lambs, but was time con- 
suming and not too popular with our 
producers. This treatment has been re- 
placed by the Phenothiazine-salt mixture. 
No barns or sheds were available; the 
flock was corralled in a dog proof corral 
each night. 

Since the pastures used in this study 
were of different sizes, and although 
within a half-mile radius of each other, 
they did vary as to the soil type, fertility, 
and plant population; it was therefore 
decided to alternate the lambs so that by 
the end of three years each group would 
have been confined in each pasture for 
one experimental period. At the comple- 
tion of three tests it was decided to con- 
duct a fourth test, rotating the lots at 
the end of every two weeks. Lot 4, which 
was conducted only two years, was pas- 
tured in a fourth pasture and was not 
included in this rotation. 

At the begmning of the test all lambs 
were carefully selected and divided equal- 
ly as to breeding of dams, weight of 
lambs, and number of twins in each 
group. The lambs were individually 
weighed on three consecutive days, at 
the beginning and end of the test. The 
average of these three weights were used 
as the initial and final weights. Month- 
ly weights were secured during the test. 

At the conclusion of the test all lambs 
were shipped to Beltsville, Maryland, 
where they were slaughtered and informa- 
tion secured as to carcass weights, dressing 
percent, and carcass grade. The right 
leg from each lamb carcass was cooked 
by a standard method and information 
was secured as to the quality and palata- 
bility of the meat. This work was con- 
ducted iointly by the Bureau of Animal

Husbandry and the Bureau of Home 
Economics. 

Results of these four tests and the av 
erage for the four tests are shown in ta- 
bles 1 and 2. Table 3 shows the in- 
fluence of the different pastures on the 
rate of gain, dressing percent, market 
grade, market value, and feed per hun- 
dred pounds of gain in each of the lots 
handled during this experiment. 

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 
Creep Feeding 

The lambs were not confined to the 
area of the creeps but had access to them 
at all times. The creeps were in the cor- 
rals where the ewes and lambs were con- 
fined for some 14 hours out of each 24 
hours. It is probable that the creep-fed 
lambs failed to consume enough grain 
to make any material difference in the 



rate of gain and finish of the lambs at 
time of marketing. It was observed that 
the lambs were very full when closed in 
the corral in late afternoon and that they 
seemed more anxious to rush out to the 
clover pasture when the corral was open- 
ed in the mornina: than to remain near 
the creep where the grain was available. 

Pasture 

In studying table 3 with reference to 
the influence of pasture on lamb produc- 
tion, it will be noted that there was con- 
siderable difference in the size of the 
pastures used in these tests. Cattle were 
in each pasture with the sheep so that 
the livestock unit per acre was compara- 
ble. An abundance of forage was avail- 
able in all pastures throughout the test 
period. The center east pasture and the 
woods pasture contained a higher percent 
of clover and were freer from weeds and

Other undesirable plants than was the west 
woods pasture. While there was an 
abundance of clover in the west woods 
pasture, the natural tendency for sheep 



to consume a variety of plants might 
have caused the ewes to consume many 
of these plants, undesirable from a nu- 
tritive point of view, leaving less room

resulted in a decrease in the milk produc- 
tion of the ewes. 

Prices Used 

In studying the prices used, one notes 
quite a difference in the selling price per 
hundred pounds from year to year. This 
difference in price from year to year was 
due to the actual difference in market 
value of the lamb rather than to any dif- 
ference in the finish or quality of the 
lambs. The lambs were graded as slaugh- 
ter lambs each year and the average for 
all lambs each year was "low choice." They 



varied less than one-third of a market 
grade. 

SUMMARY 

I. The average for the 4 tests ns given 
in the summary table show: 

A. That while there was no signifi- 
cant difference in the rate of gain, mar- 
ket grade, or price per hundred weight, 
the lambs creep-fed cottonseed meal did 
gain slightly faster, graded higher as 
slaughter lambs, and sold for slightly 
more per hundred weight. 

B. The dressing percents were 47.87, 
48.04, 49.23, and 50.50, for lots 1 through 
4, respectively.

C. The return per lamb above cost of 
teed, pasture not included, was greatest 
tor the lambs creep-fed cottonseed meal 
while with their dams on good pasture. 
The lambs receiving no feed in addition 
CO their dams' milk and pasture were 
second, and the lambs receiving a mix- 
ture of corn, oats, and wheat bran in 
addition to their dams' milk and pas- 
ture was third. 

D. The value of lambs above the cost 
of feed for the lambs in lot 4 is not 
shown. These lambs were produced only 
two years and their average price would 
include one low and one high year, 
whereas, the other two groups included 
three years of high prices and only one 
year of low prices. While the lambs pro- 
duced in this lot gained as rapidly as 
the lambs creep-fed cottonseed meal and 
had a higher dressing percent than the 
other three lots, the high feed cost per 
hundred pounds of gain would make 
them the least profitable group. 

II. That the quality of pastures sur- 
passed the influence of supplemental 
feeding is shown by the fact that: 
A. Though an abundance of grazing 



material was available in all pastures, the 
average rate of gain, dressing percent, 
market grade, and value per hundred 
weight for the three years was highest 
for the groups in the superior center east 
pasture and least for those in the inferior 
west woods pasture. 

B. Regardless of how the lambs were 
handled, the rate of gain was greatest for 
the group in the center east pasture and 
least for the group in the west woods 
pasture. 

C. When the group was rotated every 
two weeks the difference between the 
groups was not significant, although the 
rate of gain, dressing percent, and mar- 
ket value favored the cottonseed meal 
fed lambs. 

III. Quality and palatability of lambs. 

A. The market grade of lambs on fool 
and in the carcass, and the palatability 
of the cooked meat of lambs slaughtered 
at aproximately 4 to 5 months of age, 
was influenced relatively little by grain 
feed as a supplement on good to choice 
pasture while lambs were suckling theii 
dams.

PART II 

Influence of Type and Breed- 
ing In Spring Lamb 
Production 

How much can I pay for a purebred 
ram and can I afford to save ewe lambs 
for replacement purposes in order to 
grade-up an improved flock on my farm? 
These questions are foremost in the 
minds of most progressive sheep men. 

The results of many demonstrations 
indicate the possibility of improving 
farm flocks through the use of purebred 
rams of some recommended breed and 
the replacement of old ewes with their 
grade daughters. Many practical farmers 
have felt for some time that the relative 
high value of grade lambs at markci 
time, as c«;mpared to the low cost of na- 
tive ewes, favored the buying of native 
ewes for flock lenlacemenr. Parasites, 



which in the past claimed many lambs 
during the first summer of their lives, 
and the delay of one year in breeding 
ewe lambs, makes this means of securing 
flock replacements a rather unpopular 
one. 

While the grading-up method has its 
disadvantages, it does enable one to im- 
prove the type and breeding of his flock 
through the use of good purebred rams 
and offers a means of selecting early- 
maturing ewes of desirable type from 
early yeaning, heavy milking, twin-bear- 
ing dams. 

The purpose of this study was to de- 
termine the influence of type and of 
breeding. The following groups were 
used: 

Lot 1, native ewes bred to native rams. 
Lot 2, native ewes bred to Southdown 
rams.

Lot 3, high grade Southdown ewes

Description of Ewes 

The native sheep used in this study 
were those common to the Coastal Plains 
area of this state. They were long of leg. 
with long narrow heads and necks, long 
narrow shallow bodies, with long thinly 
fleshed thighs. Wool of half-blood grade 
covered the body with the exception of 
rhe head, legs, and belly. These portions 
of the body were covered with coarse 
white hair. The grade Southdown ewes 
carried three or more crosses of South- 
down breeding out of a native founda- 
tion flock. The Southdown rams were 
of present day type, being deep, broad, 
low-set, compact throughout, straight 
Hned, thickly fleshed. 

Methods Used in Test 

The ewes were pasture bred to produce 
their lambs in December, January, and 



February. Their summer and fall man- 
agement was the same as described for 
the ewes in Part I of this bulletin. The 
lambs were yeaned in December, January, 
and February. They were pastured with 
their dams on oat pasture until ap- 
proximately April 1, when they were 
moved to permanent pasture. Previous 
to lambing and while in winter quarters 
the ewes were fed a daily ration of 1 
1/3 pounds Johnson grass hay and 1/2 
pound cottonseed meal. After lambing 
and until the flock was moved to perma- 
nent pasture, the ewes and lambs were 
pastured on winter oats and the ewes 
were fed 3/4 pound of Johnson grass 
hay and 1/2 pound of cottonseed meal 
daily. No feed in addition to pasture 
was fed to either the ewes or lambs once 
they were moved to permanent pasture, 
as previous tests at this Station showed 
conclusively that the rate of gain, grade 
of lamb, and palatability of the meat of 



12 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 440 



lambs slaughtered at 4 to 5 months of 
age, were influenced relatively little by 
grain fed as a supplement on good to 
choice pasture while the lambs were 
suckling their dams. Pasture used during 
this period was the same as described 
in Part T of this bulletin. 

The birth weight of the lambs was 
used as the initial weight, and the aver- 
age of three weights taken on successive 
days at the conclusion of the test was us- 
ed as the final weights for these lambs. 
The lambs were graded as slaughter 
lambs. Half of the lambs were sold on 
the National Stock Yards Illinois mar- 



ket. The remaining half of the lambs 
in each lot were slaughtered and infor 
mation secured as to the grade of car- 
cass, dressing percent, cut-out yields, and 
plumpness of leg. The right leg of the 
lambs were cooked by a standard method 
and information secured as to cooking 
losses and as to palatability of the cooked 
meat. The cooking was done under the 
supervision of the Home Economics De- 
partment of the Mississippi Experiment 
Station.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 
In studying the results of this test, ont 
must keep in mind that no special atten 
tion was given to the selection of ewes 



for twinning, date of yeaning, rate of 
gain, milking qualities, or wool produc- 
tion. The only thought in selecting the 
ewes for this study was to secure natives 
showing no indication of improved 
breeding and to secure grade Southdown 
ewes of desirable mutton type. Twin- 
ning, milk production, date of yeaning

and other desirable characteristics can 
surely be influenced by selecting replace- 
ment ewes from dams having these de- 
sirable qualities. Twin lambs were con- 
sidered in determining the percent lamb 
crop produced by these three groups. 
There was no uniformity as to number 
of twin lambs in each lot and for that 
reason they were not considered in the 
comparisons shown in tables 4 and 5. 

The prices used in 1933 and 1934 were 
the actual prices paid by the packer buy- 
er on the National Stock Yards Illinois 
market for half of the lambs marketed 
from each of the three groups during 
those years. No prices were secured for 
1935. The price used in table 5, show- 
ing the average for the three tests, is the 
average price per hundred weight ac- 
cording to the market grade of lamb as 
given by the report of the Bureau of Agri- 
cultural Economics, Livestock Division, 



for the last Monday in May for the years 
1927 through 1934 covering lambs sold 
on the National Stock Yards Illinois mar- 
ket. Prices for choice lambs were as low 
as $7.75 per hundred weight and as high 
as $18.00 per hundred weight during this 
period. The price for wool cited in ta- 
ble 5 was the average price paid for wool 
during the same years. Prices varied 
from as low as 23 cents per pound to as 
high as 50 cents per pound. 

SUMMARY 

1. The high grade Southdown lambs 
though slightly lighter than the first- 
cross lambs at birth, gained more rapidly 
and were heaviest at we'inincr time. 

2. The high grade lambs graded 
"choice", as compared to "good" for the 
first cross lambs, and "medium" for the 
native lambs. The high grade lambs 
brought $1.04 more per hundred pounds 
live weight than the first-cross lambs.

and $2.42 per hundred pounds more thar 
the native lambs, 

3. The grade ewes produced an av 
erage of 119 lambs per 100 ewes, as com- 
pared to 116 lambs per 100 ewes for the 
native ewes. 

4. The grade ewes produced an av 
erage of 5.5 pounds of half-blood wool 
as compared to 4.6 pounds for the native 
ewes. 

5. The range in drejsing perceni 
was from 53.33 for the high grade 
lambs, 52.10 percent for the Southdown 
natives, and 50.84 percent for the native 
lambs. 

6. The carcass grades were "medium' 
for the native, "good" for the Southdown 
natives, and "choice" for the high-grade 
Southdown lambs. The length of car- 
cass becomes shorter, the color of fai 
brighter, and the weight of pelt lighter 



as the lambs approach ideal mutton type 
and breeding. 

7. The percent of leg, loin, and rib, 
(the three most valuable cuts of the lamb 
carcass) and the plumpness of leg, were 
greatest for the lambs of improved type 
and breeding. 

8. The total cooking losses from evap- 
oration and drippings was greatest for 
the higher conditioned high-grade lambs 
and least for the thinner native lambs. 

9. The results of the palatability 
study shows that the high-grade lambs 
had a slight advantage in tenderness of 
the cooked meat, quality of juiciness, and 
flavor of fat and lean. 

10. In essential respects the high-grade 
ewes were superior for lamb and wool 
production to native ewes, and native 
ewes bred to registered rams were super- 
ior to native ewes bred to native rams.

Figure 9. Yearling ewes sired by Corriedale-rams and out of Native ewes. 



PART III 

The Value of Corriedale, 
Hampshire, and Southdown 
Breeding In Spring Lamb 
and Wool Production 

The high prices paid for lambs mar- 
keted in April and May (the returns from 
an 80-pound lamb will usually purchase 
a replacement yearling ewe), coupled 
with the "trouble" of raising ewe lambs 
to replacement age, has caused many of 
our flock owners to adopt a system of 
selling all lambs produced and of pur- 
chasing their flock replacements. Tests 
conducted locally indicate that unless 
specially desirable breeds are used, and 
unless care is taken to select early yean- 
ed, rapid maturing ewe lambs from heavy 
milking, twin-bearing dams, this practice 
is probably a desirable one. Usually the 
ideal lamb to keep for flock replacement 



is the lamb most likely to top the market 
at weaning time. When such lambs are 
sold, and the small, slow-gaining, late- 
yeaned lambs that have little market 
value are maintained for flock replace- 
ment, the breeding efficiency of the flock 
is sure to be lowered. 

The matter of securmg good ewes for 
flock replacement is a problem in Missis- 
sippi. The only ewes generally available 
are the natives of the Coastal Plain area 
of the State. These sheep, while infer- 
ior in mutton conformation and lacking 
in wool covering, are very hearty and 
good doers if given a chance. Producers 
in the Coastal Plain area, in general, give 
their flocks very little attention. Few 
fat lambs are sold, and most of the in- 
come is derived from the sale of wool and 
the occasional sale of surplus ewes to 
producers in the lamb producing section 
of this state. The need of a breed to

Methods Used in Test 

The objective of this study was to study 
the influence of Corriedale, Hampshire, 
and Southdown breeding in spring lamb 
and wool production. 

A group of yearling and 2-year-old 
native ewes were purchased from South 
Mississippi, They were typical "natives," 
being the long legged, narrow shallow 
bodied type, with a covering of white 
hair over the face, legs, and belly. They 
were divided uniformly as to age and 
size, and were bred to representative 
rams of the Corriedale, Hampshire, and 
Southdown breeds. One group of ewes 
was bred to a native ram. 

The ewe lambs produced by the above 
crosses were graded as slaughter lambs 
at weaning time. They were retained 
and bred to Southdown rams to determ- 
ine their relative value in wool and spring 
lamb production. The wether lambs 
produced by these crosses were graded 
and sold as fat lambs at weaning time. 

Table 7 gives the Information as to 
birth weight, final weight, rate of gain, 
dressing percent, and market value of 
these first-cross lambs out of native ewes 
by the Corriedale, Hampshire, South- 
down and native rams. 

The first-cross and native ewes produc- 
ed for this study were handled as one 
group. They were bred first as year- 



lings to Southdown rams of present day 
type. The ewes were handled during the 
breeding and summer pasture season in 
the same manner as reported in Part I ot 
this bulletin, with the exception that no 
treatment for parasites was given to the 
ewes or lambs during the period of these 
tests. 

The ewes yeaned during December, 
January, and February. Prior to yeaning 
the ewes received a ration of 1 1/3 
pounds Johnson grass hay and 1/2 pound 
of cottonseed meal daily. With the excep- 
tion of the winter period for 1938-39, 
and 1939-40, the ewes and lambs were 
pastured on oats pasture, and the ewes 
were fed 3/4 pounds of lespedeza hay 
and 1/2 pound of oats daily. Due to 
the very dry fall of 1938 no winter pas- 
ture was available, and winter pasture 
was very limited during the winter 1939- 
40. During these winter periods the 
ewes received a ration of ground corn, 
cottonseed meal, sorghum silage, and les- 
pedeza hay. 

The ewes and lambs were moved to 
permanent pasture about March 20, where 
they remained until the lambs were wean 
ed for market. Yellow hop clover rep- 
resented approximately 75 percent of the 
permanent pasture forage; however, small 
amounts of wild barley, bur clover, white 
clover, Kentucky blue grass, Bermuda 
^rass, and dallis grass, were available. 
Neither the ewes nor the lambs received

any feed in addition to pasture during 
this period, as previous tests showed con- 
clusively that the rate of gain, grade of 
lamb, and palatability of meat of lambs 
slaughtered at approximately 4 to 5 
months of age, were influenced relative- 
ly little by grain fed as a supplement on 
good to choice pasture while the lambs 
were suckling their dams. 

Birth weights were used as the initial 
weight and the average of 3 weights 
taken on consecutive days at weaning 
time were used as final weights. 

The ewes were clipped the second 
week in April and records kept as to the 
amount of wool produced. The results 
of the 3 tests completed on this project 
are shown in tnble 8. Table 9 gives an 
average of the 3 tests completed, and the 
pvernqe wool clip from the grade ewes as 
yearling, two-year old, and three-year old 
ewes. 



DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 

A study of table 7 shows the influence 
of Corriedale, Hampshire, and South- 
down rams on the lambs produced ou; 
of native ewes. While there was rela- 
tively little difference in rate of gain of 
lambs from birth to weaning, the gain 
did favor the lambs sired by Corriedale 
and Hampshire rams. The dressing per 
cent for the wethers slaughtered favored 
the lambs produced by the Southdown 
and Hampshire rams. The slightly high- 
er dressing percent of native wethers 
over the wethers by the Corriedale rai . 
can be explained by the heavier pelts of 
the Corriedale-native wethers. 

The lambs by the Southdown and 
Hampshire rams graded one-third of r 
market grade higher than the lambs by 
the Corriedale rams and two-thirds grade 
higher than those sired by the native 
ram. The carcasses of the wether lambs 
sired by the Southdown and Hampshire

rams graded two-thirds of a market grade 
higher than the lambs by the Corriedale 
or native rams. 

Table 8 give the results of the 1939, 
1940, and 1941 tests wherein the first-class 
Corriedale-native, Hampshire-native and 
Southdown-native ewes produced in the 
tests reported in table 7 were bred to 
Southdown rams to determine their rela- 
tive value in wool and in spring lamb 
production. The average of these three 
tests is given in table 9. 



A study of this table shows that the 
Corriedale-native ewes lambed 19 days 
earlier than the Hamphire-native ewes 
and 28 days earlier than the Southdown- 
native ewes, with relatively no difference 
in the daily gain of the lambs out of these 
first-cross ewes. This earliness of lamb- 
ing resulted in the lambs out of the Cor- 
riedale-native ewes being approximately 
four pounds heavier at market time than 
those out of Hampshire-native ewes and 
approximately nine pounds heavier than

the lambs out of the Southdown-native 
ewes. 

The average rate of gain for the three 
tests are low in all lots. This was due, 
at least partially, to the large amount of 
dry lot feeding required during the first 
two tests. Insufficient winter pasture 
was available for the ewes and lambs dur- 
ing these tests. The lambs out of these 
ewes averaged "good-plus" as slaughter 
lambs. This grade has been sufficiently 
high to sell within 50 cents per hundred of 
the prices paid for market lambs sold 
prior to June 1 during the years 1927- 
1941. 

Table 9 shows the average weight of 
wool produced by these grade ewes as 
yearling, two-, and three-year-old ewes 
This table shows the Corriedale-native 
ewes led in wool production as yearling 
two- and three-year-old ewes. They av- 
eraged 7.49 pounds of wool for the three 



years, as compared to 5.78 pounds for 
the Hampshire-native ewes and 5.38 
pounds for the Southdown-native ewes. 

SUMMARY 

1. The lambs from each group of 
ewes, when sired by Southdown rams, 
averaged "good-plus" as market lambs. 

2. The average birth weight and rate 
of gain of the lambs slightly favored the 
Corriedale and Hampshire grade ewes. 
The difference was insignificant. 

3. The Corriedale-native ewes yeaning 
19 days earlier than the Hampshire-native 
and 28 days earlier than the Southdown^ 
native ewes, resulted in heavier lambs at 
a fixed market date. 

4. The Corriedale-native ewes aver- 
aged 1.71 pounds more wool each year 
as yearling, two-, and three-year-old ewes 
than the Hampshire-native ewes, and 2.11 
pounds more wool than the Southdown- 
native ewes.

PART IV 

Norlhwestern, Southwestern, 
and Corriedale-Native Ewes 
In Lamb and Wool 
Production* 

Recent trends in securing replacement 
ewes for our farm flocks have been to- 
ward buying ewes from the northwestern 
or southwestern states, rather than buying 
native ewes from the coastal plain section 
of Mississippi. The western ewes are 
largely out of grade Rambouillet ewes 
and sired by rams of Hampshire, Corrie- 
dale, or other mutton-type breeds. Thev 
are superior to our coastal plain sheep, 
being deeper, broader, and more compact 
of body, shoiter necked and legeed, and 
heavier fleshed. They are larger, weigh- 
ing from 130 to HO pounds at maturity, 
and produce a heavier wool clip. Coming 

*The first two years of this experiment was 
conducted by Ray H. Means. 



from the range section, they are reason- 
ably free from internal parasites. Since 
they are of a fine wool foundation, they 
tend to breed in time to lamb in Decem- 
ber, January, and February. 

The test reported in part three of this 
bulletin indicates the high value of Cor- 
riedale breeding for improving the value 
of our native flocks in wool yields and 
as replacement ewes for flocks used to 
produce spring lambs. A number of rams 
of this breed have been used in the south- 
ern section of Mississippi and seem well 
adapted to that area. 

With this information in mind this 
test was conducted to determine the rel- 
ative value of Northwestern, Southwes- 
tern, and Corriedale-native ewes in wool 
and lamb production. 

Sources of Ewes 

A group of native ewes was purchased 
from south Mississippi, bred to Corrie- 
dale rams, and the ewe lambs kept to

compare with ewes purchased from Mon- 
tana and from Texas. The ewes from 
Montana were largely Rambouillet and 
Hampshire crosses, whereas the ewes 
from Texas were of Rambouillet with 
evidences of Hampshire and Southdown 
breeding. Both groups of western ewes 
reached the Mississippi Station the mid- 
dle of July, 1942. 

Methods Used in Test 

Southdown rams were placed in the 
pasture with these ewes and remained 
with them until October 15. The Cor- 
riedale-native ewes were not available un- 
til the 1943 breeding season. During the 
1944, 1945, and 1946 tests the three 
groups of ewes were handled as one 
flock. They were pasture bred to South- 
down rams to lamb in December, Janua- 
ry, and February. 

During the breeding season and until 
approximately December 1 they were 
handled as were the ewes reported in part 
three of this bulletin. From December 
1 to March 15 the ewes with their lambs 
had the run of a temporary grazing crop 



of oats, and in addition the ewes were 
fed a daily ration of 1/2 pound of whole 
oats and a small amount of mixed hay 
(alfalfa and Johnson grass). The lambs 
received no feed in addition to their 
dams' milk and winter pasture. 

The ewes with their lambs were put 
on permanent pasture (see description 
of permanent pasture as given in Part I 
of this bulletin) on or about March 15 
each year where they remained without 
additional feed until the last week in 
May when the lambs were weaned, weigh- 
ed, graded as market lambs, and sold. 
The ewes were clipped the week follow- 
ing Easter Sunday, and a record was 
made of the wool produced. 

During the 1945 test each ewe receiv- 
ed a drench containing 25 grams of 
phenothiazine when placed on pasture. 
The ewes and lambs had access at all 
times to a mixture of nine parts granulat- 
ed salt and one part phenothiazine. 

Information as to birth weights of the 
lambs, weight at slaughter, wool clip pro- 
duced and other interesting data collect-

ed during these tests are shown in the 
following tables. Table 10 gives the an- 
nual results for the years 1944, 1945, and 
1946, respectively. Table 11 gives an av- 
erage for these three tests. 

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 

Attention is called to the fact that the 
results of the first year's production ol 
the Montana and Texas ewes are not 
shown in the above tables. They were 
not included because the Corriedale-na- 
tive ewes were not available until the 
following year. Although not included 
in this study, a statement of the produc- 
tion of these western ewes during their 
first year in Mississippi will be of inter- 
est to those interested in buying replace- 
vnent ewes. 

During their first year in Mississippi, 
the Montana ewes averaged a 56 percent 
lamb crop and produced an average of 
5.79 pounds ol wool, as compared to a 
46 percent lamb crop and 5.69 pounds 
of average wool clip for the Texas ewes. 
It is possible that this poor production 
record was due to the late arrival of these 
western ewes in Mississippi and stresses 
the importance of buying your ewes for 
early arrival should you use this method 
of securing ewe replacements. Yearling 
Corric dale-native ewes produced in Mis- 
sissippi weaned a 100 percent lamb crop 
and produced 8.5 pounds of wool. 

Attention is also called to the fact that 
the Corriedale-native ewes used were first- 
cross ewes out of South Mississinni native 
ewes. Should Corriedale rams be used 
in our range section for a period of years 
the percent of Corriedale breeding in 
our range flocks would be increased, re- 
sulting in a replacement ewe that should 
be superior in wool and in lamb produc- 
tion to the first-cross ewes used in this 
study. 

It will be noticed that both the Corrie- 
dale-native and Texas ewes lambed ear- 
lier than did the Montana ewes. How- 
ever, the faster gaining lambs from the 
Montana ewes were heavier at market 



time. 

It will also be noticed that the lambs 
from the Montana and Texas ewes grad- 
ed higher than did the lambs from the 
first-cross Corriedale-native ewes. A study 
of the pictures of these ewes will show 
the Montana and Texas ewes to be su- 
perior in mutton conformation and in 
fleshing qualities, which undoubtedly in- 
fluences the market grade of their lambs. 

The gross returns per ewe were based 
on the actual prices received for the 
lambs and wool when sold in cooperative 
lamb and wool pools. The variance in 
gross income per ewe from year to year 
was due, in a large measure, to the dif- 
ference in prices paid for lamb and wool 
from year to year. The higher gross re- 
turns for the Texas and Corriedale-native 
ewes was due to the higher percent lamb 
crops produced by these two groups. 

SUMMARY 

1. The percent lamb crop and gross 
returns per ewe were highest for the 
Texas ewes and lowest for the Montana 
ewes. 

2. The Corriedale-native and Texas 
ewes yeaned earlier than did the Mon- 
tana ewes. However, the faster gaining 
lambs from the Montana ewes were 
heaviest at weaning or market age. 

3. The wool clip was highest for the 
Montana ewes, followed closely by the 
Corriedale-native ewes. 

4. There was relatively no difference 
in the market grade of the lambs produc- 
ed by the Montana and Texas ewes, both 
of which graded higher than did the 
Corriedale-native ewes. 

5. The Corriedale-native ewes were 
approximately eaual in wool and lamb 
production to the Texas ewes and the Mon- 
tana ewes. The experiment clearly indi- 
cates that either of the three methods of 
securing replacement ewes will prove sat- 
isfactory, with a slight advantage favor- 
ing the Corrieda'e-native and Texas ewes 
provided other good management prac- 
tices are carried into effect.

CORN HYBRIDS AND VARIETIES IN MISSISSIPPI^ 

By ROBERT C. ECKHARDT, W. A. DOUGLAS and A. L. HAMNER^' 



Corn performance tests designed to de- 
termine the most desirable strains, were 
continued in 1946 on four experiment 
stations in Mississippi. The most prom- 
ising new hybrids from neighboring 
states were tested with the best open- 
pollinated varieties and older hybrids. 

It is well recognized that open-polli- 
nated varieties of corn differ greatly in 
adaptation and performance, but many 
farmers do not realize that some hybrids 
may be unsuited for planting in Missis- 
sippi, particularly hybrids that have been 
bred for conditions differing from those 
existing in the South. The performance 
tests of previous years have proven clear- 
ly that most northern hybrids are un- 
suited for use as full-season corns in the 
South because of poor husk extension and 
soft grain which makes them subject to 
serious insect damage. Only one north- 
ern hybrid. Pioneer 300, was included 
in the 1946 comparisons. It was includ- 
ed because a large amount of seed of 
it was offered for sale in the Delta in 
the spring of 1945 and 1946. 

Each test contained 25 entries arranged 
in a balance lattice square design with 
six replications. Each plot was 2 rows 
wide and 10 hills long with rows and 
hills usually spaced 40 inches apart. Four 
seeds were planted per hill and later thin- 
ned to two plants per hill. Some of 
these tests had fertilizer appHed before

mology and Plant Quarantine, Agricultural Re-

planting and all tests received at least 
32 pounds of nitrogen per acre. 

The hybrids and varieties tested and 
the source of seed are shown in table 1. 

Seasonal Conditions 

A very wet spring and early summer 
was unfavorable for crop growth, especial- 
ly at Natchez and West Point. The Nat- 
chez test was not harvested because of 
irregular stands due to very heavy rains 
at the time of emergence. Corn yields 
for the entire state were slightly above 
the ten year average of 15.3 bushels per 
acre. The estimated 1946 yield was 
16.5 bushels per acre. 

Explanation of the Data Reported 

Yields are based on 70 pounds of husk- 
ed earcorn per bushel. Any two kinds 
of corn should differ by at least the num- 
ber of bushels shown opposite the nota- 
tion "least significant difference (5 per- 
cent level)" before any great confidence 
can be placed on the two entries being 
really different in yielding ability. 

The percentages of plants lodged are 
based on actual counts, all plants broken 
below the top ear-bearing node (joint) 
were classified as stalk lodged, while all 
plants leaning 30 degrees or more from 
the vertical were classified as root lodg- 
ed. Husk length is reported as the esti- 
mated husk extension beyond the ear tip, 
in inches. Although the percentages of 
earworm infested ears vary somewhat, 
these differences probably are not signi- 
ficant, and none of the inbreds, hybrids, 
and varieties can be considered to have 
shown any material degree of resistance 
to the earworm in these tests. All other 
notes are self-explanatory. 

State- Wide Results 
Hybrids 

Fifteen of the entries were planted at 
all locations. The 4-station average for 
these entries are reported in table 2. Sev-

en hybrids, all in commercial production, 
were at the top in yield. 

Two Dixie hybrids, Dixie 17 and Dixie 
11, led in yield with average 4-station 
yields of 73 and 68 bushels, respectively. 
Dixie is a name given hybrids developed 
by members of Southern Corn Improve- 
ment Conference (consisting of U.S.D.A. 
and State Experiment Station workers in 
the Southeast). These hybrids must have 
been tested for a period of years at a 
number of locations and have been ap- 
proved by the Conference to receive the 
regional designation "Dixie." 

Dixie 11 (formerly Mississippi Experi- 
mental hybrid 5111) is similar in per- 
formance to Louisiana Hybrid 468. These 
two hybrids have three of their four com- 
ponent inbred lines in common. Dixie 
11 has an excellent record for yield for 
the two years tested. It is a prolific white 
hybrid with medium to small sized ears 



which have sufficient husk protection 
against rice weevil for all but the south- 
ern part of Mississippi. The main fault 
of Dixie 11 is its susceptibility to lodging 
under some conditions. 

Dixie 17 was the outstanding hybrid 
in yielding ability. Dixie 17 has an out- 
standing yield record for the past two 
years in Mississippi, Tennessee, North 
Carolina and Georgia where it has been 
thoroughly tested. It is similar in adap- 
tation to Tennessee Hybrid 10 and as 
seed becomes available v/ill undoubtedly 
replace much of the acreage now planted 
to Tennessee 10. Dixie 17 does not have 
as much protection from rice weevil as 
does Dixie 11 but has about the same de- 
gree of protection as Tennessee 10 and 
Station Mosby. 

Louisiana Hybrid 502 differs by only 
one inbred from Louisiana Hybrid 468 
and Dixie 11. It has a good yield rec-

ord, and is slighdy later, higher eared 
and somewhat more weevil resistant than 
either Louisiana 468 or Dixie 11. 

Funk G714 and N. C. Hybrid 27 were 
about the same in yielding ability but N. 
C. 27 had less lodging and fewer ears 
damaged by rice weevils. Both hybrids 
have yellow grain, and lack husk protec- 
tion for South Mississippi. Although not 
included in these tests, Louisiana Hybrid 
1030 has been grown in many other tests 
over a period of years. It had the least 
damage from earworm on infested ears 
and the greatest percent of ears without 
earworm damage of any hybrid tested. 
It has had a good yield record and is 
fairly resistant to damage by rice weevil. 
The grain is mixed in color and of high 
quahty. This hybrid is recommended 
for the area in Mississippi south of U. S. 
Highway 82. 

Open-Pollinated Varieties 

As in past years. Station Mosby was 
the highest yielding open-pollinated va- 
riety with Jarvis the lowest yielding va- 
riety. Jellicorse and Station Laguna 
were also high in yield, ranking below 
Station Mosby. None of the high yield- 
ing open-pollinated varieties had as much 
husk protection from rice weevil as is 



desired in South Mississippi. 

Three strains of Jarvis were tested in 
1946. Sewell Jarvis was the best in yield, 
Calloway next and Holly Springs poor- 
est. Sewell Jarvis has a medium dent 
kernel and is fairly soft while the other 
two strains are hard and flinty. The 
yield of the best strain, Sewell Jarvis, 
was considerably less than that of the 
better open-pollinated strains such as Sta- 
tion Mosby. 

Varieties Planted Only in 
South Mississippi 

In addition to the varieties planted at 
all locations, several additional varieties 
were planted at Poplarville (table 3). 
These were the Louisiana strain of Tux- 
pan, Whatley Prolific, Yellow Whatley, 
Smith Mosby, Stewart Corn, and Pigott 
Red Cob. All yielded less than the hy- 
brids and most of the other open-pollin- 
ated varieties in test. 

They all have one desirable character — 
a long tight husk which makes them 
relatively resistant to weevil. The low- 
est yielding variety, Pigott Red Cob, had 
the smallest percentage of ears infested 
with rice weevil. However, it is very 
doubtful whether a farmer can afford 
to take a 20 to 30 percent loss in yield

dition to those planted at all stations 
(tables 4, 5, 6). These hybrids were 
Pioneer 300, Dixie 44, and Funk G708. 
Pioneer 300 was the lowest yielding en- 
try in test at Holly Springs and S'tone- 
ville and only Holly Springs Jarvis was 
lower at West Point. Pioneer 300 is a 
single-eared hybrid of Corn Belt type with 
no husk protection against birds and wee- 
vils. Except for early hogging off, or 
for late planting, there seems to be no 
place for these early Corn Belt hybrids 
in Mississippi. 

Funk G708 has not had as good a per- 
formance record as Funk G714. It is sus- 
ceptible to stalk lodging late in the sea- 
son. 

Dixie 44 is a yellow hybrid which is 
primarily single-eared and relatively 
early. It has no husk protection against 
rice weevil but can be grown in north 
Mississippi where rice weevils are not a 
problem. Dixie 44 has equaled Station 
Mosby in yield on land producing 60 
bushels or less per acre, but is not as 
productive as Station Mosby on land pro- 
ducing yields above 60 bushels. Dixie 44 
stands well at harvest time and could 
profitably replace most of the acreage 
now grooving early Corn Belt types such 
as Pioneer 300, or Jarvis, if an early yel- 
low corn is desired. 

General Recommendations 

Adapted hybrids can be expected to 
yield from 10 to 20 percent more than 
the best open-pollinated varieties and as 
much as 50 percent more than poor open- 
pollinated varieties and unadapted hy- 
brids. A 20 percent increase on a 30- 
bushel yield level is 6 bushels per acre 
but the same 20 percent increase on a 70- 
bushel yield level is 14 bushels per acre.

Recommended Cultural 
Practices 

In order to obtain the most profitable 
return from an investment in hybrid seed 
corn, certain cultural practices are neces- 
sary. The following recommendations 
should be followed in order to grow corn 
profitably: 

1. Seed: Plant an adapted high yield- 
ing variety or hybrid. 

2. Fertilizer: Delta Area — apply 300 
pounds of ammonium nitrate, or 600 
pounds of nitrate of soda (96 pounds of 
nitrogen) per acre in a band at the bot- 
tom of the old furrow and bed on this 
band. If land is to be flatbroken, apply 
in a band with fertilizer attachment on 



CORN HYBRIDS AND VARIETIES IN MISSISSIPPI, 1946 



D 



breaking plow. On land deficient in 
phosphorus and potash, 500 pounds of 
6-8-4 can be substituted for 100 pounds 
of ammonium nitrate or 200 pounds of 
nitrate of soda. The 6-8-4 should be ap- 
plied before or during the planting. 

Hill Area — use the same amount of 
fertilizer as above except apply 1/3 be- 
fore or during planting and 2/3 as a side 
dressing when corn is 1 to 3 feet high. 
Complete fertilizer should go under corn 
or in bands on each side of and slightly 
below seed when applied with fertilizer 
attachment on corn planter. 

3. Time of planting: North Mississippi, 



April 15 - May 1; Central Mississippi, 
April 1 - April 15; South Mississippi, 
March 15 -April 1; or as soon thereafter 
as possible. 

4. Rate of planting: 10,000 plants per 
acre should be the goal. This is approx- 
imately one plant each 15 inches in rows 
40 inches apart. This rate should be used 
to make efficient use of the large amounts 
of fertilizer. Thick spacing also shades 
out weeds. In order to obtain the above 
stand, plant at least one seed every 12 
inches to allow for losses caused by in- 
sects, etc. 

5. Cultivation: The land should be cul- 
tivated often enough to control weeds.

Cotton Variety Tests. 1946 



By J. F. O'KELLY 



The field data for these tests were col- 
lected by S. P. Crockett at Holly Springs 
and H. A. York at Raymond. 

Cotton variety trials extending over 
many years have rather definitely estab- 
lished the merits of varieties available to 
farmers of this State. The number used 
could very well be reduced to a half 
dozen or less without a reduction in the 



farmer's income and without reducing 
the quality or quantity of the State's pro- 
duction. 

Weather and insect damage in the 1946 
season were so severe at the Poplarville 
Station that no attempt was made to har- 
vest any cotton. Conditions were litde 
better at Raymond and State College, 
and moderate yields were possible only 
through the use of calcium arsenate for 



Table 1. Yields at the several locations, 1946.

boll weevil control. Probably 80 percent 
of the cotton obtained at State College 
was set in August. This percentage of 
the crop is usually set in July. Condi- 
tions were only slightly better at Holly 
Springs. 

Tests at all locations were liberally fer- 
tilized. This made it possible for the 
plants to recover with the appearance of 
normal weather in late July and August 
and, hence, to set bolls under the protec- 
tion of calcium arsenate. A late frost 
permitted many of these late bolls to open 
normally. 

Prices for lint cotton used in the cal- 
culations were based on ten weeks of 



the marketing season at Memphis, Ten- 
nessee, beginning early in September. 
The value used for seed was $60.00 a 
ton. This is conservatively low in com- 
parison with prices received for seed after 
controls were lifted. In computing acre 
values the same price was used for seed 
regardless of whether the assumed lint 
grade was middling, strict low middling, 
or low middling. This means that acre 
values are a little high where low grades 
of lint are assumed. There is no indica- 
tion, however, that this difference ma- 
terially affects the showing made by any 
particular variety. 

A study of the averages indicates there

MISSISSIPPI ACJRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 442 



is no change in the varieties best suited 
to the hill areas of the state. These in- 
clude Deltapine and the Stoneville strains, 
with Coker 100 Wilt coming to the 
front as a strong competitor. A few oth- 
er varieties are equally as good in special 
cases. 

Empire, a Stoneville selection from 
Georgia, has made a very creditable show- 
ing since its introduction a few years ago. 
It yields quite well and, like Bobshaw, 
has a strong fiber. It can be used more 
as soon as a source is established for an 
adequate supply of breeder seed. 

Seed for these tests was obtained in 



all cases from the originators. 

The'-c is some indication that the sup 
ply of good planting seed for the 1947 
season may be inadequate, especially if 
there should be a considerable increase 
in acreage planted and much planting 
over should be necessary. Farmers would 
do well to: 

1. Make certain that any seed to be 
planted will germinate well. Send a sam- 
ple to the State Seed Laboratory, State 
College, if necessary. 

2. Provide enough surplus seed to 
plant over at least one-fourth of the acre 
age if necessary.

COTTON VARIETIES FOR HILL SOILS OF MISSISSIPPI, 1946 



Plenty of good seed for prompt plant- 
ing when conditions are right is excellent 
crop insurance. 

At least a small surplus of planting 
seed is especially desirable for the grower 



of certified seed and certified lint. Hav- 
ing to plant a part of the acreage over 
with another kind of cotton can com- 
pletely upset the farmer's plans for cer- 
tification.

Farm Management 
And Production Costs

NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI

Farm Management and Production Costs 

ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 

By W. J. EDENSi 



This bulletin reports a study, by the 
cost account method, of 40 dairy and cot- 
ton farms in Northeast Mississippi for 
the calendar year 1944. The purpose of 
the study was to determine farm costs and 
farm management practices in their rela- 
tion to production problems and incomes, 
especially on farms producing milk for 
sale, and with possible recommendations 
for adjustments. Attention in particular 
is given to the costs of producing milk 
and cotton in their relationship to types 
of farm organization, and profits derived 
from these major enterprises as well as 
from minor enterprises and the farm busi- 
ness as a whole. 

Most of the farms in Northeast Missis* 
sippi produce cotton and a large number 
keep milk cows. Cotton has been the 
principal income crop since the area was 
first settled. Since the turn of the cen- 
tury, it has been demonstrated that a 
single row-crop enterprise as the main 
source of income involves considerable 
risk and does not give a return to the 
farm business as a whole comparable to 
that which is realized when income enter- 
prises are more diversified. Consequent- 
ly, farmers and various agricultural 
agencies have been endeavoring to find 
the best means and methods to be used 
in providing the most profitable combina- 
tion of enterprises for farms in each of 
the naturally defined areas of the State. 

Emphasis has been placed on more live- 
stock production as well as improved 
practices in growing crops. For the past 
three decades, much attention has been 
given to dairying as a supplement to cot- 
ton production. Agricultural and vari- 
ous business and civic agencies have en- 
couraged the establishment of milk pro- 
cessing plants such as cheese factories, 
creameries, and condenseries in many 
communities of the State with most of 



the larger plants located in Northeast 
Mississippi, Fifty-seven of these plants 
have been established since 1912. At pres- 
ent, 31 are in operation with most of the 
fatalities having occurred among cream- 
eries. Nineteen of the 31 plants now in 
operation are located in the 11 counties 
constituting the Northeast Mississippi 
Milkshed Area.^ 

With the coming of these plants, the 
dairy cow population in the respective 
communities, or patronage areas, increas- 
ed considerably. Many thought that this 
step in farm enterprise diversification 
would solve the one-crop system of farm- 
ing. It has helped; but other problems 
have arisen such as low production per 
cow, unprofitable methods of feeding, 
high-cost transportation, low production 
during winter months making it difficult 
for milk plants to operate efficiently dur- 
ing that period, and dairy cattle diseases, 
and parasites. While some farmers appear- 
ed to be profiting by adding dairying to 
their business, others appeared to be de- 
riving little benefits from milking cows 
along with the production of cotton. 

Method of Selecting Farms 

Farms selected for this study were sug- 
gested by county agricultural agents, milk 
plant managers and their field men, coun- 
ty representatives of the Agricultural Ad- 
justment Agency, and local representa- 
tives of the Soil Conservation Service. 
These agricultural leaders were requested 
by personal interview to suggest farmers 
who, they thought, were progressive in 
their farm operations, would be interest- 
ed in making a study of their farm busi-

ness, and wnulH be willing to keep the 
necessary records. 

The enterprise organization of each 
farm was studied by means of the 1944 
farm plan sheets made available by the 
several county AAA officers. Farms 
were then divided into three groups de- 
termined by the emphasis placed on the 
production of milk and cotton, and farm 
types were so designated. Farms with 
a large number of cows compared with 
the number of acres in cotton comprised 
one group, or dairy-cotton farms. A few 
farms in this group did not grow cotton 
after having planned to do so. Where 
the number of acres of cotton was large 
in proportion to the number of cows, the 
farm type was designated cotton-dairy. 
The farms having about the same number 
of cows as acres of cotton constituted the 
third type, or dairy & cotton. Of the 40 
farms keeping records, 16 were dairy- 
cotton, 12 cotton-dairy, and 12 dairy & 
cotton. This manner of grouping was 
selected in order that comparisons could 
be made relative to cost factors and in- 
come for the various farm enterprises un- 
der different organization conditions. 

Operators of the farms thus selected 
were interviewed on their farms where 
consent was obtained to keep the neces- 
sary records. The supervision of the 
keeping of the records was done by a 
member of the Experiment Station staff, 
and each farm was visited once every 
4 weeks. 

Description of Farms Studied 
Land Utilization 

The average amount of land per farm 
for the 40 farms was 170 acres (Table 1). 
Cropland accounted for 75 acres per farm, 
or 44 percent of total land. Open, tillable 
pasture land amounted to 43 acres per 
farm, representing 25 percent of all land; 
and open non-tillable pasture land 
amounted to 21 acres, or 12 percent. Thus, 
81 percent of all lard was open land. 
Woods pastured accounted for 8 percent 



of the land per farm; woods not pastured, 
5 percent; and the other land used for 
miscellaneous purposes, 5 percent. It will 
be noted that pasture land of all kinds 
amounted to 88 acres, or slightly more 
than one-half of the total average acre- 
age per farm. 

On farms where cotton was the major 
enterprise, 55 percent of the land was 
cropland. Where dairy cows were the 
major enterprise, 30 percent of the land 
was cropland; and where the two enter- 
prises ranked about the same, 42 percent 
of the land was devoted to crops. It will 
be noted that where major emphasis was 
placed on dairy cows, slightly rnore than 
half of the total land was devoted to 
open pasture. Where cotton received 
major emphasis, only 30 percent of the 
farm acreage was used for open pasture 
land. 

Crop Acres 

On the average, more acres of land 
were devoted to corn than to cotton. Corn 
and cotton acreages were about the same 
on cotton-dairy farms. Hay constituted 
the largest acreage of any crop (table 2). 
Other than cotton, cash crops were rela- 
tively unimportant on most farms. Two 
farms produced hay for sale and one rais- 
ed watermelons and cantaloupes for the 
market. It will be noted that less than 
one-half acre per farm was used for grow- 
ing silage crops. Only six farmers grew 
silage. These six farms grew an average 
of 2 acres per farm. 

On farms where dairying was the ma- 
jor enterprise, 74 percent of the acres 
cropped was devoted to feed crops; on 
cotton-dairy farms, 69 percent; and on 
dairy & cotton farms, 69 percent. Acres 
of oats per farm averaged 6.8. However, 
only 14 of the 40 farms actually growing 
oats had an average of 19.4 acres per 
farm. 

Hay was an important crop on most of 
the farms. Johnson grass predominated 
in the Northeast Prairie Area, but in

the Pontotoc Ridge and Northeast High- 
land Areas, soybean acreage for hay was 
greatest. Lespedeza was next in impor- 
tance. A considerable number of farms 
interplanted corn with soybeans and har- 
vested the plants for hay or stocked them 



down. Most of the farmers growing soy- 
bean hay, ground it before feeding it to 
dairy cows and other livestock. 
Classes of Livestock 

Dairy cows were the most numerous 
livestock on the average farm (table 3). 



FARM MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS 



7 



The average number of dairy cows per 
farm was 14, with a total value of $981 
per farm, or an average value of $69 per 
cow. Milk cows constituted 47.3 percent 
of the total farm investment in livestock. 
The range in number of dairy cows for 
all farms was from 4 to 40. Only two 
farms milked less than 6 cows; 4 less 
than 7 cows; and 10 less than 10 cows. 
Nine farms milked 20 or more cows. 
Nineteen herds averaged 4,000 pounds 
per cow or more, and 8 had an average 
production of more than 5,000 pounds of 
milk per year. The range in the amount 
of milk produced per cow per year was 
from 2,200 pounds to 5,800 pounds with 
4 herds producing less than 3,000 pounds 
per cow. 

Farm Investment 

The investment per farm amounted to 
110,743 (table 4). Cotton-dairy farms had 
the largest investment, as might be ex- 



pected on account of larger cropland re- 
quirements. Dairy-cotton and dairy & 
cotton farms were more nearly equal in 
real estate investment and total invest- 
ment. 

The average investment in real estate 
for the 40 farms was 60.2 percent. On 
cotton-dairy farms the investment in real 
estate was 68 percent, while dairy-cotton 
and dairy & cotton farms had a real estate 
investment of 52.5 and 56.1 percent, re- 
spectively. Investment in livestock was 
lowest on cotton-dairy farms. The rela- 
tive investments in feeds and equipment 
were about the same. 

Farm Receipts and Expenses 

Farm receipts are the total income from 
farm sources. They include money re- 
ceived or due from the sale of the current 
year's crops, sale of livestock and live- 
stock products, sale of equipment and

supplies, and any increase in the inven- 
tory value of the farm property. Farm 
receipts for the 40 farms averaged $5,930 
(see table 5). 

Farm expenses represent the cost of 
operating the farm business, except for 
interest on investment and value of the 
operator's time. Farm expenses include 
all cash expenses for labor, feed, supplies, 
taxes, etc.; the value of unpaid family 
labor other than the operator's; the value 
of board furnished hired help; the cost 
of livestock and equipment purchased; 
and any decrease in the inventory value 
of farm property. Farm expenses, or 
farm business expenses, do not include 
family living expenses. The average 
farm expenses for 40 farms was $3,973. 
Farm Returns 

Farm income, which is farm receipts 
less farm expenses, amounted to $1,957 
for the 40 farms as a whole. Deducting 
from farm income the amount of inter- 
est at 5 percent on the average invest- 
ment, gives a labor income of $1,420. 
Labor earnings are found by combining 
labor income and contributions made by 
the farm to family living, such as house 
rent and foods. This amounted to $2,010 
per farm. 

Return on the average farm investment 
was $1,400 or 13 percent. The operator's 
time may have been undervalued. If that 
were true, the percentage return on in- 
vestment would be less in proportion to 
the increase of the value of the operator's 
time. 

Farm receipts and expenses for the dif- 
ferent types of farms varied direcdy with 
the size of the investment. However, it 
will be noticed that labor income did 
not vary much from one type to another. 
Causes for these differences and similar- 
ities will be discussed in following sec- 
tions of this study. 

Costs and Returns for Milk 
Production 

Milk was produced for sale on all 



farms. About 12 percent of all milk pro- 
duced was used on the farm. Practically 
all of the remaining 88 percent was sold 
to cheese plants and condenseries. A few 
farmers sold their milk to wholesale dis- 
tributors. 

The average number of milk cows per 
farm was 14. (See table 6). Milk pro- 
duced per farm amounted to 55,991 
pounds, or 3,931 pounds per cow. The 
family used 3,861 pounds of milk, and 
the average farm fed 2,729 pounds of 
milk to calves. 

Feed Costs 

Feed was the largest item of cost in 
the production of milk. The feed cost 
per herd for one year on all farms aver- 
aged $1,109. Of this, concentrates 
amounted to $608; roughage, $372; and 
pasture, $129. This total feed cost amount- 
ed to 59.6 percent of total milk produc- 
tion costs. On a per cow basis, this feed 
cost per year was $78, and the feed cost 
to produce 100 pounds of milk was $1.98. 

The amount of feed per cow varied 
considerably, and much of this variation 
was due to whether there was available 
suitable land for hay and pasture produc- 
tion in the three soils areas in Northeast 
Mississippi — Black Prairie, Northeast 
Highland, and Pontotoc Ridge. The five 
farms feeding the least concentrates av- 
eraged 642 pounds per cow. The five 
farms feeding the most concentrates av- 
eraged 2,898 pounds per cow. The five 
farms feeding the least roughage averaged 
969 pounds per cow, and the five farms 
feeding the most roughage averaged 5,157 
pounds per cow. The capacity of milk 
cows, the I^nowledge of farmers relative 
to desirable feeding standards, and high 
feed costs were other factors contributing 
to the wide variation in the amounts of 
feed fed on various farms. 

When concentrates fed per cow were in- 
creased, milk produced per cow increased 
(table 7). On the other hand, when 
roughage per cow was increased, there 
was a slight decrease in the amount of

milk produced (table 8). The cost to 
produce milk increased as the amount of 
both concentrates and roughage fed per 
cow was increased. 

Concentrates fed during the year to 
cows on dairy-cotton farms amounted to 
$50.51 per cow, which was the highest 
value of the three types of farms (table 
9). This could be expected on farms 
where farmers placed the most emphasis 
on the dairy enterprise. However, these 
same farms had the least roughage cost 
of 123.70 per cow, compared with $32.14 



for cotton-dairy farms, and $24.66 for 
dairy & cotton farms. Total feed costs 
were the greatest on dairy-cotton farms, 
next on cotton-dairy, and least on dairy 
& cotton farms. 

The five farms producing milk at low- 
est cost, fed $43.10 worth of feed per cow, 
and the five farms producing milk at the 
highest cost fed $96.34 worth of feed. 
Since cows on high cost farms produced 
only 3,230 pounds each, this would in- 
dicate that the farm operators were at-

tempting to get high production out of 
cows of low efficiency. 

Man Labor Costs 

The cost of labor per herd was $507 
(table 7). The average number of man 
hours spent on one cow per year was 
145, and was valued at $35.62. This 
amounted to 91 cents per 100 pounds 
of milk produced. The labor cost range 
for 100 pounds of milk was from 46 cents 
to $1.65. The amount of labor used per 
cow for one year ranged from a low of 
96 hours for the 10 lowest farms to a 
high of 209 hours per cow for the 10 
farms requiring the greatest amount of 
labor. The average cost of labor per hour 
spent on milk cows on all 40 farms was 
24.5 cents. The range for this man-hour 
cost was from 16.4 cents to 39.5 cents. 
In producing milk, man labor accounted 
for 27.3 percent of the gross farm cost 
to produce 100 pounds of milk. Con- 
sequently the efficient use of labor is an 
important factor in producing milk eco- 
nomically. 

Profit 

Total milk returns per herd amounted 
to $2,219. Net farm costs per herd plus 
hauling charges amounted to $1,849. Thus 
the profit per herd was $370 and per cow, 
$25.99. The profit per 100 pounds of 
milk was the average price received 
($4.02) less the total cost per 100 pounds 
($3.33), and amounted to $0.69. 

Labor Return 

Assuming that profit on the enterprise 
is also a return to labor, the total return 
to labor would be profit on the enterprise 
plus man labor charges to the enterprise. 
The sum of $370 (profit) and $507 (labor 
charges) gives a labor return of $877. 
This amounts to $61.61 per cow, and 
$1.59 per 100 pounds of milk sold. 

Much of the labor used on the farms in 
this study was unpaid family labor. Oft- 
entimes this labor may be used on an en- 
terprise when the cost of production is 
relatively high, particularly where it is 



convenient to engage in that enterprise, 
and still receive income that adds to the 
well-being of the farmer and his family. 
In case of the dairy enterprise, the farmer 
charges the cows with grain, hay, and 
other feeds at farm value (market value 
less transportation costs) instead of what 
they actually cost. Consequently, an en- 
terprise may show a loss when its physical 
input costs are charged at farm value, yet 
the farmer can afford to go right along 
producing the enterprise and will be bet- 
ter off by doing so unless some alterna- 
tive enterprise opportunity appears where- 
by he can get more for his input costs 
or values. 

Of the 10 farms that made minus in- 
comes on dairy cows, only 3 made a minus 
labor return per cow. One farmer lost 
$31 per cow, but his labor return per 
cow was $30 and the labor per hour spent 
producing milk was $0.17, Another farm- 
er had a loss of $4 per cow, yet his labor 
return per cow was $51 and the return 
per hour spent on milk cows was $0.32. 
If profit and loss had been computed on 
the basis of actual costs of producing feed 
on the farm, the return for labor would 
have been considerably more. Therefore, 
if a farmer receives the cost of produc- 
tion for 100 pounds of milk or a hundred 
pounds of cotton, that price includes the 
current wage rate for his labor and for 
all unpaid famliy labor. However, farm- 
ers are entided to a fair profit above act- 
ual costs, as is expected in any other busi- 
ness, in order that they build up reserves 
for depression periods and for old age. 

Costs and Returns per Cow on 
Different Type Farms 

A study of table 10 shows costs and 
returns for the dairy enterprise by types 
of farming on a per cow basis. The av- 
erage costs and returns per cow for the 
40 farms is repeated for comparative pur- 
poses. 

The annual net cost to keep a cow for 
one year on dairy-cotton farms amounted 



12 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPI-RIMLNT STATION BULLETIN 443 



to 1 120. The costs on cotton-dairy farms 
were $130, and $113 on dairy & cotton 
farms. The annual profit per cow was 
$36 for dairy-cotton farms. There was 
a loss of $7 per cow for cotton-dairy 
farms, and a gain of $42 on dairy & cot- 
ton farms. It will be noticed that the 
profit was considerably greater on the 
farms where there was balanced emphasis 
on milk cows and cotton. Also, it will 
be noticed that cows on the dairy & cot- 
ton farms produced an average of 4,392 
pounds of milk. That was a production 
of 400 pounds per cow above the dairy- 
cotton farms, and 1,000 pounds more 
than on cotton-dairy farms. Feed costs 
and net farm costs per cow were less than 
on the other two types of farms. 

The differences between farm types 
pointed out in the preceding paragraph 
are favorable to those farmers who placed 
about the same emphasis on both cotton 
and milk cows in their farm program. 
Since, dairy & cotton farms used fewer 
man hours per cow, spent less for feed, 
and got a higher production from their 
cows, it would seem that their cows were 
more profitable because labor was used 
more efficiently and their cows were more 
efficient in converting feeds into milk. 

Labor returns per cow were likewise 
greater on dairy & cotton farms. This 
return was 118 percent greater, or more 
than twice as great as the labor return on 
farms where emphasis was placed mainly 
on cotton. It was, however, only 9 per- 
cent greater than labor return per cow on 
farms placing major emphasis on the 
dairy enterprise. 

Cotton Production Costs and 
Returns 

Cotton was produced on 32 of the 40 
farms on which records were kept. An 
average of 21.8 acres of cotton was pro- 
duced on each farm. Actual bales gin- 
ned per farm was 20,2 or nearly one bale 
per acre. The number of 500-pound bales 
produced per farm was 21.3. The aver- 



age price received per pound of lint cot- 
ton for all farms was 21.21 cents, and the 
cost to produce one pound of lint was 
13.28 cents. 

Man Labor 

Man labor was the largest item of cost 
in producing cotton (table 10). The total 
man-labor cost for the average cotton en- 
terprise on 32 farms in Northeast Missis- 
sippi was $1,089. This labor cost was 
$50 per acre of cotton grown, $51 per 
500-pound bale and seed, and $40 per 
500 pounds of lint. Man-labor cost per 
pound of lint was 8.04 cents, which con- 
stituted 60.5 percent of the total cost to 
produce one pound. Consequently, any 
steps taken by farmers to reduce the cost 
of producing cotton will necessarily in- 
clude the consideration of man labor. 

The man labor required to grow an 
acre of cotton amounted to 141 hours, 
and only 3 hours more were required to 
produce a 500-pound bale since prodi' 
tion was so near one bale per acre. The 
range in hours required per acre of cot- 
ton on the 32 farms was from 63 to 176. 
Barring the fact that there were differ- 
ences in yield per acre among farms, there 
still would be much room for increasing 
the efficiency of labor. And since this 
cost item is 60.5 percent of the total cost 
of production, farmers could well look 
to using available labor en the farm, as 
well as hired labor, to a more distinctive 
advantage. 

Total Costs of Producing Cotton 

The average cost of producing the cot- 
ton enterprise on each of the 32 farms 
was $1,800, which amounted to $83 per 
acre. (See table 10). The cost to pro- 
duce 500 pounds of lint was $66, which 
gave a cost of 13.28 cents per pound for 
lint cotton. This return from one acre 
of cotton for lint and seed was $104 and 
$17.57, respectively. The total return from 
the enterprise per farm was $2,646, there- 
by leaving a profit of $846 for the cot- 
ton enterprise and $38.90 per acre pro-

duced. With a cost per pound of lint at 
13.28 cents and an average price of 21,21 
cents received per pound, this gave a 
profit of 7.93 cents per pound of lint to 
the farmers growing cotton. 

Costs of Cotton Production on 
Different Type Farms 

There was much variation in the acre- 
age devoted to cotton production on the 
three types of farms (table 11). The 
range was from 9.1 acres per farm on 
dairy-cotton farms to 39.9 acres on cotton- 
dairy farms. Dairy & cotton farms pro- 
duced 12.1 acres, which was only 3 acres 
more than was produced on dairy-cotton 
farms, and less than one-third of the acres 
grown on cotton-dairy farms. The num- 
ber of acres produced on the five low- 
cost farms and the five high-cost farms 
was about the same, and approximately 
the same as was produced on dairy & cot- 
ton farms. 

The items of cost in the production of 
cotton varied considerably in value for 
the three types of farms. Man labor per 
acre, the most important cost item, was 
least on dairy-cotton farms and the most 
on cotton-dairy farms, |28 and $54 re- 
spectively. This cost was $49 per acre on 
dairy & cotton farms. Horse labor costs 
followed the same pattern. The low cost 
of man labor to produce an acre of cot- 
ton on dairy-cotton farms probably was 
due more to the smaller yield of cotton 
per acre than to more efficient use of la- 
bor on dairy & cotton farms. 

FertiHzer costs varied from $2.39 per 
acre on dairy-cotton farms to $5.32 on cot- 
ton-dairy farms. The five farms produc- 
ing cotton at the least cost per pound 
used $5.33 worth of fertilizer per acre. 
The total cost of producing a pound of 
lint on the three types of farms did not 
vary much, but was least on dairy & cot- 
ton farms. (See table 12.) It will be 
seen that the cost of production per pound 
on the five low cost farms was only 8.24 
cents, while on the five high cost farms, 



the cost to produce one pound of lint 
was 17.17 cents. 

Cotton Returns on Different Type 
Farms 

Total returns per acre of cotton was 
the smallest on dairy-cotton farms. (See 
table 12.) This is largely the reflection 
of a low yield per acre for this type of 
farming. The average return per acre 
for all types was $122; for dairy-cotton, 
$84; forxotton-dairy, $124; and for dairy 
& cotton, $132. Profits per acre were 
$39, $27, $38, and $48, respectively. The 
five farms producing cotton at the lowest 
cost per pound — 8.24 cents — had a profit 
of $75 per acre, whereas $18.38 was the 
profit per acre on the five farms produc- 
ing cotton at the highest cost per pound, 
which was 17.17 cents. 

Considering returns and profits as a 
whole, it appears that the yield per acre 
was the most important factor determin- 
ing the cost to produce a pound of cotton 
and the return the farmer got for his 
labor. 

Costs and Returns for Other 
Enterprises 
Costs and Returns on Corn 

Thirty-seven of the 40 farms keeping 
records produced corn. Acres per farm 
averaged 25.3 and the production per 
acre was 23.3 bushels. On the average, 
27.8 man hours and 26.7 horse hours 
of labor were required per acre. 

The total average cost per farm for 
the corn enterprise was $563, or $22.23 
per acre. (See table 12). With a produc- 
tion of 23.3 bushels per acre, this resulted 
in a cost of 95.5 cents per bushel. Again, 
as can be seen, the largest item of cost 
was labor. Man labor cost amounted to 
35 percent of the total cost to produce a 
bushel of corn. Horse labor accounted 
for 28.3 percent. It will be recalled that 
the proportionate part of the total cost 
to produce one pound of cotton was 60.5 
percent for man labor and 10.8 percent

for horse labor. In the case of corn, 
horse labor has assumed a larger part ol 
the cost. Again it will be noticed that 
the land cost to produce a bushel of corn 
was 13.8 cents. This amounts to 14.5 
percent of the total cost to produce a 
bushel of corn, whereas the land cost 
to produce a pound of cotton was 0.5 
cent, or 3.7 percent of the total cost to 
produce a pound. 

The total return per farm from the 
corn enterprise was $714, or $28.19 per 
acre. The average farm value per bushel 
was $1.25. With a cost of 95.5 cents 
per bushel, this gave the farmers a profit 
of $151 for the corn enterprise, $5.96 per 
acre, and 25.5 cents per bushel. The 
labor return per hour spent on corn was 
$0.49. 

Costs and Returns for Hogs 

Thirty-eight of the 40 farms produced 
hogs. Only a few farmers produced for 
the market. Sales by others were for 
the purpose of disposing of a small sur- 
plus produced. 

It cost $12.41 gross to produce 100 
pounds of live pork. Of this amount 
83.5 percent was for feed. On an aver- 
age, 306 pounds of corn valued at $7.54. 
82 pounds of other feed valued at $2.66. 



and pasture valued at 16 cents constituted 
the kinds, amounts, and values of feeds 
fed to produce this 100 pounds of live 
pork. It required 5.8 hours of man la- 
bor per 100 pounds of pork valued at 
$1.46 which represented 11.8 percent of 
the total cost to produce 100 pounds of 
pork. 

Considering credits of manure and mis- 
cellaneous credits which amounted to 
$0.38 per 100 pounds, the net cost to pro- 
duce 100 pounds was $12.03, The value 
per 100 pounds of Hve pork produced was 
$12.53, which left a profit of $0.50 per 
100 pounds. This small profit on pro- 
ducing hogs was due to the unfavorable 
hog-corn ratio in. Northeast Mississippi 
in 1944. 

Workstock Costs 

Workstock was used on all farms and 
there was an average of 4.3 head per 
farm. Each head of workstock worked 
462 hours, or 46 work days of 10 hours 
each during the year. The average cost 
for all farms was 22.9 cents per hour. 

Feed amounted to $88 per head which 
was 78.1 percent of total costs. Two thou- 
sand seventy-six pounds of concentrates, 
principally corn, were fed per head at 
a cost of $52. Roughage fed per head 



16 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPl.RIMENT STATION BULLETIN 4-13 



amounted to 2,263 pounds valued at $30. 
Pasture was charged at actual cost or 
$6.47 per head. Man labor to care for 
one head of workstock for a year was 
35.8 hours, which cost $9.89. Costs oth- 
er than feed and man labor amounted 
to $14.95. A manure credit of $7.50 per 
head was deducted from total gross costs 
per head of $113, which resulted in a 
net cost of $106 to keep one head of 
workstock for a year. 

Since workstock worked only 46 days 
per head during the year, some atten- 
tion should be given to utilizing work- 
stock labor more efficiently. 

Factors That Affect Costs and 
Returns 

Size of Business 

Size is an important factor that af- 
fects all business enterprise and particular- 
ly is this true of farming. Farm income 
and the family standard of living are 
largely determined by this factor. The 
size of a farm business can be measured 
in several ways. Number of acres oper- 
ated, capital investment, crop acres, 
amount of labor used, number of units 
comprising the major enterprises such as 
acres of cotton, number of milk cows in 
the herd, are measures commonly used. 
The more desirable measure to use in de- 
termining the size of a farm business 
depends a great deal on the type of farm- 
ing followed. 

Some of the measures used to show 
the size of the 40 farm businesses are 
shown in table 13. Acres per farm for 
all farms averaged 170, with a total in- 
vestment of $10,743. Cotton-dairy farms 
had more total acres, cotton acres, crop 
acres, and a larger investment than the 
dairy-cotton or dairy & cotton farms. This 
could be expected since emphasis was 
placed on cropping. As a whole, cotton- 
dairy businesses were the largest, dairy- 
cotton farms next, and the dairy & cotton 
farms the smallest. 

When considering the size of business 



in the Northeast Prairie, Northeast High- 
land, and Pontotoc Ridge Soil Areas, it 
will be noticed that the Prairie farms 
ranked highest in all measures (table 13). 
The Northeast Highland Area was next 
in all measures and the Pontotoc Ridge 
Area was the lowest in all measures. 

Man work units. Since man labor is a 
common denominator of all farms, table 
14 was constructed to show the relation 
of man work units per farm to and 
among other important factors. As the 
man work units (10 hours of production 
from work performed by one man) per 
farm increased, the number of cows in- 
creased, acres of cotton increased very 
pronouncedly, and labor income increas- 
ed. 

Acres of cotton. Acres of cotton per 
farm varied considerably. (See table 15.) 

Labor requirements increased per 500- 
pound bale produced as the acres of cot- 
ton per farm increased on farms that 
grew more than 10 acres. Under increas- 
ing mechanization conditions the reverse 
of this relationship would be expected. 
However, practically all of the cotton pro- 
duction on the 32 farms was performed 
by man and horse labor. Thus it would 
appear that labor is being used less ef- 
ficiently on the larger farms. The same 
relationship exists when considering cot- 
ton-dairy farms alone. 

Larger farms have more cropper ten- 
ants, and according to data presented in 
table 15, such labor is not as efficient 
as the labor furnished by the operator, 
members of his family, and the small 
amount of labor hired during the year 
on the smaller farms. Labor income in- 
creases as the size of the cotton enter- 
prise increases, but labor income does not 
necessarily reflect efficient use of cropper 
labor on farms when considering the size 
of the business. 

Labor Efficiency 

Using labor to the best advantage is 
one of the most important problems with

which farm operators deal. Labor re- 
quirements are much greater for some en- 
terprises than for others, and at the same 
time, the demands on all farms for labor 
is highly seasonal, particularly for crops. 
Labor requirements for crops constitute 
the largest cost item in their production. 
For cotton, this cost amounts to 60.5 per- 
cent of the total expenses of growing the 
crop. Labor requirements for corn, hay, 
and other crops were somewhat less, but 
still were the highest single cost item. 

Man hours per cow. The amount of 
labor used per cow ranged from 86 hours 
to 262 hours, and the average amount of 



man labor per cow was 145 hours for the 
40 farms. (See table 16.) There was 
practically no relationship between hours 
used per cow and the amount of milk 
produced per cow. However, as man 
hours expended per cow increased, the 
cost to produce 100 pounds of milk in- 
creased, and the labor return per hour 
decreased. Thus the labor used per cow 
should be kept at a minimum in keeping 
with the ability of the cow to produce 
milk. 

Man hours per acre of cotton. The la- 
bor used per acre of cotton varied very 
much also. Seven farms averaged only 



18 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAP F.XPFRIMENT STATION BULLETIN 443 



77 man hours per acre while a like num- 
ber of farms averaged 168 hours. As 
the man hours per acre increased, the 
pounds of cotton produced per acre in- 
creased, which was unlike the relation- 
ship of labor expended per cow and the 
milk produced per cow. However, as 
the pounds of cotton per acre and labor 
per acre increased, the cost to produce an 
acre of cotton increased. Unlike the ap- 
plication of labor to cows, as labor on 
cotton per acre increased, the cost to pro- 
duce one pound of lint decreased and 
the labor return per hour increased up 
to 150 hours per acre and then decreased. 
Consequently, a farmer should be very 
careful about increasing the hours of la- 
bor used per cow and the labor used per 
acre of cotton above 150 hours under 
conditions similar to those on the 40 
farms in Northeast Mississippi, 

Rates of Production 

Types of farming and rates of produc- 
tion. Farms placing the most emphasis 
on cotton (cotton-dairy farms) kept cows 
which had the lowest production, or 3,400 
pounds each (table 17). Farms where 
major emphasis was placed on the dairy 
enterprise (dairy-cotton farms) kept cows 
that produced an average of 4,000 pounds 

Table 17 



each. And farms which placed about 
the same emphasis on both dairy and cot- 
ton enterprises kept milk cows that pro- 
duced an average of 4,400 pounds of milk 
each. 

There was litde relationship between 
the amount of milk produced per cow and 
the size of herd or the amount of con- 
centrates fed per cow. Roughages fed 
per cow decreased as milk production in- 
creased and labor used per cow followed 
the same trend. It will be noticed that 
where there was a balance between num- 
ber of cows and acres of cotton per farm 
that labor per cow was the lowest and 
milk production per cow was the high- 
est. This made for more profitable milk 
production as shown in table 18. 

The cost to keep a cow for one year 
decreased by types of farming as the pro- 
duction per cow increased among the 
types. Cost per cow was $148 on cotton- 
dairy farms, $138 on dairy-cotton farms, 
and $133 on dairy & cotton farms. Cosl 
of producing 100 pounds of milk on 
dairy & cotton farms was the lowest, 
amounting to $2.83. The cost on dairy- 
cotton and cotton-dairy farms per 100 
pounds of milk was $3.27 and $4.09, re- 
spectively. Farmers who placed major 
emphasis on producing cotton and minor

emphasis on producing milk lost an av- 
erage of |7 per cow. Dairy-cotton farms 
made a profit of $36 per cow, and dairy 
& cotton farmers made $42 on each 
cow kept. Likewise, the return per hour 
for labor used on milk cows was high- 
est on dairy & cotton farms, amounting 
to $0.61. Labor return per hour for 
this enterprise on dairy-cotton and cotton- 
dairy farms was $0.47 and $0.22, re- 
spectively. 

Milk per cow. A study of the dairy 
enterprise on farms in Northeast Missis- 
sippi finds, as in similar studies else- 
where, that low producing cows are not 
profitable and that as production per cow 
increases, profits per cow increase. 

Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds 
of milk per year showed a loss of $15.73 
per year, whereas cows producing an av- 
erage of 5,438 pounds netted the farmer 
$44. (See table 19.) Only four farms 
had cows producing below 3,000 pounds. 
The yearly cost to keep a cow increased 
as the amount of milk per cow increased. 
It cost $124 per year to keep a cow pro- 
ducing an average of 2,575 pounds, and 
it cost $175 to keep a cow that averaged 
5,438 pounds. Thus the cost to produce 
approximately an extra 3,000 pounds of 
milk above the average production of the 
low producing cows was $51. That is the 
same as stating that farmers who kept 
cows that produced above 5,000 pounds, 
produced the last 3,000 pounds of milk 
at a cost of $1.70 per hundred. 

Feed costs per cow increased as pro- 
duction increased, but the cost to pro- 
duce 100 pounds of milk decreased. Profit 



per cow increased as production per cow 
increased. The cost to produce milk with 
a cow producing 5,000 pounds was 31 
percent less than with a cow producing 
2,500 pounds, and the labor return per 
cow was 500 percent greater for 5,500- 
pounds production cows. 

Cost to produce 100 pounds of milk 
was $4.51 for farmers having cows that 
produced 2,575 pounds annually. Where- 
as, the cost was $3.11 per 100 pounds 
on farms having cows that averaged 5,438 
pounds. Labor returns per hour spent 
on milk cows increased as the milk pro- 
duced per cow increased. Again, it 
might be pointed out that though the 
farmers with the lowest producing cows 
made a minor profit per cow, they had 
a labor return of $14 per cow. Assum- 
ing the farmer could not use his labor 
more profitably on some other enter- 
prise, and though his cows were low pro- 
ducers, his cows did pay all expenses oth- 
er than labor and gave the farmer a re- 
turn of $14 per head as part payment 
for the labor he spent on them during 
the year. Labor return per cow was $85 
where cows averaged producing above 
5,000 pounds of milk. 

Pounds of cotton per acre. The pro- 
duction of cotton per acre ranged from 
196 pounds to 837 when considering all 
farms. Seventy-five percent of all farms 
growing cotton had an average yield 
above 400 pounds per acre and 44 per- 
cent of the farms producing cotton had 
a yield above 500 pounds. (See table 20.) 

As production per acre increased, man 
hours and total cost per acre increased.

Likewise, profit per acre and labor return 
per hour increased. The farmers who 
produced above 770 pounds per acre re- 
ceived nearly one dollar per hour for their 
labor used on cotton. 

Types of Farming 

The yield of cotton per acre varied 
considerably on the 32 farms producing 
it. Table 21 shows this variation by types 
of farming. Cotton-dairy farms grew 
four times the average of cotton as wa-i 
grown on dairy-cotton farms and a little 
more than three times the amount grown 
on dairy & cotton farms. The yield per 
acre was slightly more than a bale per 
acre on both cotton-dairy and dairy & 
cotton farms, whereas the yield was only 
two-thirds bale per acre on dairy-cotton 
farms. 

The cost of producing a pound of cot- 
ton varied little between types of farms, 
but varied considerably between individ 
ual farms. The cost per pound on dairy- 
cotton and cotton-dairy farms was 13.3 
and 13.5 cents, respectively. The cost to 
produce a pound of cotton on dairy & 
cotton farms was 12.4 cents, or one cent 
less than for the other farm types. The 



range in cost to produce a pound of cot- 
ton on the 32 farms was from 6.67 cents 
to 21.16 cents. Seventy-five percent of 
the farms produced rotton at a cost range 
from 10 to 16 cents per pound with an 
average cost of 13.3 cents for all farms. 

Labor returns per hour spent on cotton 
averaged 63 cents for the 32 farms. Low 
yields per acre undoubtedly account for 
the low labor return on dairy-cotton 
farms. On the other hand, yields were 
approximately the same for cotton-dairy 
and dairy & cotton farms. Yet, the re- 
turns per hour of labor on dairy & cotton 
farms was 33 percent higher than on 
dairy-cotton farms. This difference was 
due largely to the fact that the cotton- 
dairy farms used 31 hours more labor per 
acre, or 26 percent more than was used 
by dairy & cotton farms. 

Combination of Enterprises 

The combination of crops and animal 
enterprises for 39 farms and for the three 
types of farming in Northeast Mississippi 
are shown in table 22. The most impor- 
tant crop enterprises were cotton, corn, 
and hay. Corn and hay were grown for 
livestock feed. Hay was a cash crop on

two farms. Cotton and milk cows are 
the major income enterprises. 

Generally, a farmer receives the most 
of his income from the farm enterprise 
on which he spends the most of his la- 
bor. The average farm had 14.2 milk 
cows, on which 205 ten-hour days of pro- 
ductive work were spent. Also, farms 
producing cotton had an average of 21.8 
acres in that crop on which 307 ten-houi 
days of productive work were spent. 
Thus 49 percent more labor was used on 
the cotton enterprise than on the dairy 
enterprise for all farms. 

All farms produced milk for the mar- 
ket. Only 32 farms produced cotton. 
Therefore, for eight farms, the sale of 
milk was the only source of cash income 
except for miscellaneous sales of surplus 
stock, eggs and feed, which contributed 
considerably to labor income on some 
farms. All of the farms sold surplus live- 
stock such as calves and heifers, eggs, 
hens, hogs, and a few sold some hay and 
corn. Labor income for eight farms in 
the dairy-cotton farm group not produc- 



ing cotton was 73 percent of average la- 
bor income for the entire group of dairy- 
cotton farms. In other words, farms in- 
cluding cotton in their farm program along 
with milk cows in this type of farming 
had a larger labor income. However, prof- 
it per herd on the eight farms depending 
on cows for their cash income was $883, 
or 33 percent above the average herd 
profit of $665 for dairy-cotton farms; 
and more than twice as much profit per 
herd as for the 40 farms, which was $370. 

Type of farming related to enterprise 
profits. Farms placing major emphasis 
on cotton lost $7 per cow annually and 
$89 per herd. But they made a profit 
of $38 per acre on cotton and a profit 
of $1,516 on the cotton enterprise. (See 
table 23.) Farms placing about the same 
emphasis on both milk cows and cotton 
received the greatest return per cow and 
per acre of cotton. Labor income was 
slightly higher than for the other types 
of farming — dairy-cotton and cotton- 
dairy. Since the dairy & cotton farms 
were slightly smaller than dairy-cotton 
farms, and only about 50 percent as large

as cotton-dairy farms, it appears that 
much attention should be given to the de- 
sirabiHty of organizing farms so that 
major emphasis is placed on both the 
cotton and dairy enterprises in the area 
of this study. 

Weather conditions were very favorable 
in Northeast Mississippi to cotton produc- 
tion in 1944 and only fair for feed crops 
and pastures. These conditions should 
be considered when making an appraisal 
of the results of this report. The fact 
that cotton-dairy farms with a larger in- 
vestment did not make a large labor in- 
come was due to the loss they sustained 
on their dairy herds and to using farm 
labor less efficiently. 

Soil Crop Adaptation 

Growing a crop on the type of soil to 
which it is best adapted usually gives the 
highest labor returns. Progressive farm 
operators give much thought to placing 
crops in their farm layouts so that this 
relationship exists. On 22 farms the 
adaptation of crops to soils on which they 
were grown was "good"; on 14 farms, 
"fair"; and on 4 farms it was "poor" 
(table 24.) The adaptation of crops to 
soils on the farm as a whole was used as 
a basis for the above classification. 

The rate of production was highest 
where soil crop adaptation was good. It 



cost 12.42 cents to produce a pound of 
lint cotton where adaptation was good, 
15.05 cents where it was fair, and 15.17 
cents where adaptation was poor. The 
cost to produce a bushel of corn was 94 
cents where soil crop adaptation was good, 
$1.10 where it was fair, and $1.41 where 
soil crop adaptation was poor. The cost 
of producing cotton per pound was 23 
percent greater on farms with poor soil 
crop adaptation than on farms when the 
soil crop adaptation was good. It cost 
50 percent more to produce corn on farms 
where the soil crop adaptation was poor 
than where the soil crop adaptation was 
good. Also, it will be observed that 
labor return per hour spent on cotton was 
73 cents where soil crop adaptation was 
good, 61 cents where it was fair, and 54 
cents on farms where it was poor. Labor 
income was highest on farms where soil 
crop adaptation was good and lowest on 
farms with poor soil crop adaptation. 
Milk Production by Seasons 
Seasonal fluctuation of the production 
of milk was tremendously great on a 
large majority of the farms. Since few 
farmers grow winter pastures and with 
many feeding lightly in the winter, milk 
production is piled up from April to 
September. In fact, 64 percent of the 
milk produced by 571 cows on 40 farms 
was produced from April to September. 



FARM MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS 



23 



This great fluctuation in milk produc- 
tion during the year affects very Httle the 
efficient operation of the farm business 
as they are now organized, since the la- 
bor spent on a cow varies only a small 
amount from season to season. On the 
other hand, milk processing plants are 
faced with a very difficult problem. Since 
their equipment, which represents a rela- 
tively large investment, is used only for 
processing whole milk, these plants are 
forced to carry equipment and labor nec- 
essary for capacity production for less 
than 6 months during the year and then 
operate much under capacity for a large 
portion of the year. Should the milk 
plants in the area shut down during their 
slack season, there would be no market 
outlet for farmers producing milk, which 
would be disastrous to the dairy business. 
Yet most dairy farmers permit their cows 
to virtually shut down in production dur- 
ing the winter months and expect milk 
plants running at one-fourth capacity or 
less to continue operation. 

Seasonal production related to costs 
and returns. Thirteen farms milked cows 
that produced for sale during the months 
of January, February, and March, only 
146 pounds each per month. That was 
less than gallon daily per cow. For 
the 40 farmers as a whole, the average 
daily amount sold per cow in the months 
of January, February, and March was 
only 7.3 pounds of milk. That was less 
than 1 gallon per day. Cows producing 
above 5,000 pounds for sale during the 
year averaged 11.6 pounds of milk per 
day in the first quarter of the year and 
reached a production of slightly less than 
2 gallons per day in the months of July, 
August, and September — their highest 
producing quarter. Milk sold per cow, 
on the average, was 1.3 pounds per day 
less than was produced. This amount 
was consumed by the family or by calves. 
Cows producing less than 5,000 pounds of 
milk sold per year reached their peak of 



daily production in the second quarter 
of the year. 

The trend of milk sold monthly per 
cow in each of the quarters of the year, 
as well as the labor return per hour for 
labor used on milk cows is shown in fig- 
ure 2. Increase in production for the sec- 
ond quarter of the year was rather abrupt. 
The increase for cows produced below 
3,000 pounds sold annually was approxi- 
mately 90 percent, and over 100 percent 
for cows producing from 3 to 4 thousand 
pounds. This increase in the springtime 
was not as great for cows above the 4,000- 
pound mark. It is shown further that pro- 
duction per cow declined gradually from 
the second quarter to the third quarter, ex- 
cept when more than 5,000 pounds were 
sold per cow, and then dropped precipit- 
ously in the fourth quarter, reversing the 
movement in the spring months. 
Farm Practices 
Practices followed in feeding cows 
varied from farm to farm giving varying 
results. Records of these methods of feed- 
ing show that the combination of feeds 
and the capacity of cows to convert feed 
materials into milk play a greater part in 
profitable milk production than do mere 
quantities of feed. A few farmers feed 
for winter production and many feed to 
keep their cows alive until spring grass 
comes. Others feed for winter produc- 
tion and then practically quit feeding 
when the cows begin to get a few nibbles 
of grass in the spring. A few dairyme)i 
are beginning to provide winter grazing 
by planting oats, or other winter crops. 
All indications point to the need for a 
more detailed study of feeding practices 
by dairymen under actual farm condi- 
tions. 

Producing milk for the winter market. 

Farmers milking cows that have a rela- 
tively high production in the winter when 
compared with those having a low pro- 
duction in the winter months, produce 
milk more cheaply and receive the largest 
return per cow.

FARM MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS 



25 



When winter production was relatively 
high, the average production per cow for 
January was 392 pounds, or 13 pounds 
per day. Low winter producers gave less 
than Y2 gallon of milk per day, which in- 
dicates that the low producers were prac- 
tically dry. 

The yearly per day cost of keeping the 
average cow on the five farms where pro- 
duction of milk was low in winter months 
was $0.29. The yearly per day market 
value of the milk produced on these same 
farms was 3.72 cents per pound. With 
a cow producing 4 pounds per day, the 
daily value of milk per cow was 14.88 
cents. Thus the average cow on the five 
farms where winter production was low 
was kept at a loss of about 15 cents per 
day during January. The loss per day 
would have been greater if the daily cost 
had been determined for the month of 
January. This unfavorable situation con- 
tinued through February and on into the 
spring months until production increased 
sufficiently to equal cost of production. 
In the fall months, production dropped to 
the point where daily costs per cow for 
the months of October, November, and 
December were greater than the daily 
value of milk produced. 

On the other hand, the yearly per day 
cost to keep the average cow on the five 
farms where production of milk was rela- 
tively high per cow in the winter months 
was 39.7 cents. The yearly per day mar- 
ket value of the milk produced on those 
same farms was 3.85 cents per pound, 
and with a cow producing 13 pounds of 
milk per day in January, the daily value 
of milk produced was 50.1 cents. There- 
fore, the average cow on the five farms 
where winter milk production was rela- 
tively high was kept at a gain of 10.4 
cents per day. This gain was above all 
costs including labor. 

Summary 

Th's study was based on farm records 
kept by 40 farmers in 5 counties of North- 
east Mississippi for the year 1944. Farms 



were selected in the Black Prairie, North- 
east Highland, and Pontotoc Ridge soil 
areas, and were further selected on the 
basis of emphasis placed on milk cows and 
cotton. 

The average acreage per farm was 
170 with cropland amounting to 44 per- 
cent. Open, tillable pasture amounted to 
25 percent of all land, and open non- 
tillable land represented 12 percent. 

Milk cows were the most numerous 
livestock on the average farm with 14 
head each. The range in number was 
from 4 to 40. 

The average investment per farm was 
110,743. Total real estate investment 
amounted to |38 per acre and livestock, 
equipment, feeds, and miscellaneous sup- 
plies amounted to $25.20, which gave a 
total farm investment of $63.20 per acre. 
Average farm receipts amounted to 
$5,930; farm expenses were $3,973, and 
the average labor income was $1,420 per 
farm. 

Milk was produced for sale on all 
farms. There was an average of 14 milk 
cows per farm with an annual production 
each of 3,931 pounds. The feed cost was 
59.6 percent of the total cost of produc- 
ing 100 pounds of milk. Man labor 
amounted to 27.3 percent. The net farm 
cost to keep a cow for one year was 
$120.98, and the net farm cost to produce 
100 pounds of milk was $3.08. With an 
average hauling charge of 25 cents per 
100 pounds, the cost of 100 pounds de- 
livered at the plant was $3.33. 

The cost of producing milk delivered 
at the plant on dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, 
and dairy & cotton farms was $3.27, $4.09, 
and $2.83, respectively. Similarly the 
profit per cow was $36, — $7, and $42. 
The average cost to keep a cow for 1 
year on dairy-cotton farms was $120; on 
cotton-dairy farms. $130; and $113 on 
dairy & cotton farms. (Price received 
at plant.) It will be noticed that costs 
were least and labor returns were highest 
on dairy & cotton farms. 



26 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 443 



Thirty-two farms produced cotton av- 
eraging 21.8 acres and 20.2 bales ginned 
per farm. The average price received per 
pound of hnt cotton was 21.21 cents, and 
the cost to produce one pound of lint 
was 13.28 cents. Man labor constituted 
60.5 percent of the total cost to produce 
1 pound of lint. An average of 141 hours 
of man labor was required on the 32 
farms to grow 1 acre of cotton. On dairy- 
cotton farms, 112 hours of man labor were 
required to produce 1 acre of cotton. On 
cotton-dairy farms, 151 hours were requir- 
ed, and dairy & cotton farms required 120 
hours. The cost to produce a pound of 
hnt cotton on dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, 
and dairy & cotton farms was 13.31 cents. 
13.55 cents, and 12.42 cents, respectivelv- 

The cost to produce a bushel of corn 
was 95.5 cents; 100 pounds of live pork, 
$12.41; and the cost to keep one head of 
workstock for a year was $105.82. 

Cotton-dairy farms had more total 
acres, cotton acres, crop acres, and a larg- 
er investment than the dairy-cotton or 
dairy & cotton farms. Farms in the 
Black Prairie soil area ranked highest in 
all measures of size of farm business. 
The Northeast Highland came second 
and the Pontotoc Ridge Area was third. 

As the man work units per farm in- 
creased, the number of cows increased, 
acres of cotton increased, and labor in- 
come increased. Labor returns per hour 
of labor increased as the number of cows 
in the herd increased. In general, as 
the acres in cotton per farm increased, 
the man hours of labor required to pro- 
duce one bale increased. This seems to 
be due to the fact that as the size of the 
farm increased, the number of sharecrop- 
pers per farm increased, which indicates 
that sharecropper labor was used less ef- 
ficiendy. Also, as the man equivalent 
available for work on the farms increas- 
ed, the units worked per man decreased. 
With man labor constituting 60.5 percent 
of the cost of producing a pound of lint 
cotton, the efficient use of labor is of 



vital importance. Labor requirements 
per cow were lowest on dairy & cotton 
farms. 

Cotton-dairy farms kept the lowest pro- 
ducing cows and dairy & cotton farms 
kept the highest producers. There was 
little relationship between the amount of 
milk produced per cow and the size of the 
herd. Cows producing less than 3,000 
pounds of milk per year showed a loss 
of $15.75 per head, whereas cows pro- 
ducing above 5,000 pounds netted the 
farmers $44 each. The average annual 
production per cow for the 40 farms was 
3,931 pounds, and production per cow 
on dairy & cotton farms was 4,392; on 
dairy-cotton farms. 3,993 pounds; and on 
cotton-dairy farms, 3,413 pounds. Farmer.; 
keeping cows that produced above 5,000 
pounds produced the last 3,000 pounds 
of milk at a cost of $1.70 per hundred 
when compared with production per cow 
of less than 3,000 pounds. Labor returns 
per hour spent on milk cows increased as 
the milk produced per cow increased, 
and the annual labor return per cow was 
$85 where production averaged above 
5,000 pounds. 

The production of lint cotton per acre 
ranged from 196 pounds to 837 pound-;. 
Seventy-five percent of the farms produc- 
ing; cotton had an average yield of about 
400 pounds per acre, and 44 percent had 
a production above 500 pounds per acre. 
All tvpes of farming showed an increase 
in man hours required per acre, total 
costs per acre, and profit per acre as the 
pounds of cotton produced per acre in- 
creased. The yield was slightly more 
than a bale per acre on both cotton-dairv 
and dairy & cotton, and only 2/3 bale 
per acre on dairy-cotton farms. 

The principal combination of farm en- 
terprises on farms was cotton, milk cows, 
corn and hay. Cotton and milk cows 
were the major income enterprises. Farms 
placing major emphasis on cotton lost 
$7 per milk cow, but made a profit of 
$38 per acre on cotton. Farms placing 



FARM MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS 



27 



about the same emphasis on both cotton 
and milk cows received the greatest re- 
turn per cow and per acre of cotton. 
Farms producing milk at the highest cost 
produced twice the acreage of cotton that 
was produced on low cost farms. Varia- 
tions in the proportionate combinations ol 
enterprises on farms producing cotton and 
milk at a high cost and a low cost (table 
23) was not significant, except for the 
difference in cotton acreage, which would 
indicate that differences in costs were due 
more to such factors as capacity of cows, 
feeding practices, pasture per cow, qual- 
ity of seed, amount of fertilizer used, soil 
fertility, labor efficiency and the man- 
agerial ability of the farmer. 

The cost to produce one pound of cot- 
ton increased as soil fertility decreased. 
The cost relationship was the same for 
each of the soil areas. 

The rate of crop production was high- 
est where soil-crop adaptation was good. 
The cost of producing cotton per pound 
was 23 percent greater on farms with 
poor soil-crop adaptation than on farms 
where soil-crop adaptation was good. It 
cost 50 percent more to produce corn on 
farms where the soil-crop adaptation was 
poor than where it was good; and labor 
income was highest on farms where soil- 
crop adaptation was good, and lowest on 
farms with poor soil-crop adaptation. 

Sixty-four percent of the milk produc- 
ed by 571 cows on 40 farms was produced 
from April to September, inclusive, or in 
one-half of the year. The daily average 
amount of milk sold per cow in the 
months of January, February, and March 



was 7.3 pounds, or less than 1 gallon. 
Milk production per month for the 571 
cows increased 117 percent from January 
to May, and decreased 50 percent from 
July to November. Cows producing be- 
low 3,000 pounds of market milk per 
year, and dropping very low in winter 
production, produced milk at a cost of 
$3.88 per 100 pounds with a labor re- 
turn of 25 cents per hour. Cows pro- 
ducing from 4,000 to 5,000 pounds of 
market milk annually produced at a cost 
of $3.41 per 100 pounds and gave a la- 
bor return of $0.58 per hour. 

On five farms where milk production 
was lowest per cow in January, the av- 
erage amount produced daily by each 
cow was 4 pounds — less than 1/2 gallon. 
These same cows reached their peak pro- 
duction of 14 pounds of milk per day or 
1.6 gallons in May. On five farms where 
winter production was relatively high, 
the average daily production per 'cow in 
January was 13 pounds. Low winter 
producers were kept at a loss of 15 cents 
per day in January, and relatively high 
winter producing cows were kept at a 
gain of 10.4 cents per day. Profit per 
cow was three times as great and labor 
returns per hour were twice as great, on 
farms where winter production per cow 
was relatively high. 

The cost to produce one acre of cot- 
ton was greater where share-croppers were 
used, but this was due principally to the 
high cost of labor which was paid with 
one-half of the cotton crop and to less 
efficient use of this labor available on 
the larger farms. 



In summary, the findings of this study appear to suggest the following recom- 
mendations: 

Keep high producing cows. Cows with a production below 3,000 pounds gave 
an annual labor return of $14. On farms where production was above 5,000 pounds, 
the return was $85 per cow. 

Grow cotton on soils of high fertility. The cost to produce cotton on farms of 
high soil fertility was 12.58 cents per pound, whereas the cost was 14.67 cents on 
farms of low soil fertility, or a cost spread of nearly 2 cents. This spread of cost 
between high and low fertility farms was nearly 4 cents per pound in the Black Prairie

area. On land that produced between 700 and 800 pounds of lint per acre, the profit 
on each acre was $83. On land that produced between 200 and 300 pounds of lint, 
the profit per acre was only $15. 

Use labor more efficiently. Cows on which 125 hours were spent gave a labor 
return of $0.56 per hour, and cows on which more than 200 hours were spent gave 
a labor return of only $0.18 per hour. 

The average cost to grow a pound of lint was 13.28 cents. Labor amounted 
to 8.04 cents of this cost, or 60.5 percent of the total cost to produce a pound of lint 
cotton. On farms where the average labor performed per man available was less than 
100 days during the year, the man labor cost to produce 1 pound of lint cotton 
was 9.3 cents. Where the days of labor per man were 250 and above, the man labor 
cost was 5.2 cents per pound. 

Place major emphasis on both cotton and dairy enterprises. There is a definite 
place for both cotton and milk cows in the organization of farms in Northeast Mis- 
sissippi. This combination of enterprises permits more efficient use of labor and farm 
by-products, and cotton and dairy cows supplement each other by giving the farmer 
a higher return per hour for his labor. 

Labor return per hour spent on milk cows on dairy & cotton farms was $0.61. 
On dairy-cotton farms the returns were $0.47 per hour and on cotton-dairy farms it 
was only $0.22 per hour. On dairy & cotton farms labor returns per hour spent 
on cotton was $0.81, whereas it was $0.49 and $0.61, respectively, on dairy-cotton and 
cotton-dairy farms. 

Grow crops on soils to which they are best adapted. On farms where soil-crop 
adaptation was good, the cost to produce a pound of cotton was 12.42 cents, and the 
cost to produce a bushel of corn was $0.94. Where soil-crop adaptation was poor, the 
cost was 15.17 cents per pound for cotton and $1.41 per bushel of corn. 

Feed cows for winter production. Low winter producers gave a labor return 
of $0.35 per hour. Relatively high winter producers returned $0.72 per hour. 

Breed for winter production. Cows bred to calve in the late fall are available 
for their best flow of milk in the winter months as well as in the spring and early 
summer months. 

Reduce costs by increasing rates of production. Farms that produced cotton at 
the lowest cost had the highest yields, or 1.14 five-hundred pound bales per acre, and 
farms producing cotton at the highest cost had the lowest yields or 0.78 five-hundred 
pound bale per acre. 

Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds of milk annually, produced it at a cost 
of $4.51 per 100 pounds, and cows producing more than 5,000 pounds produced it 
at a cost of $3.11 per 100 pounds,, or a difference of $1.40. 

Large farms should use available labor more fully. Days of work (10-hour days) 
per man on farms with more than three man equivalents available averaged less than 
125 for the year. Days of work per man on farms with 1.6 man equivalents avail- 
able averaged 310. 

Keep only workstock needed. The net cost to keep one head of workstock for 
a year was $106. 

Use workstock more efficiently. The average he?d of workstock was used only 
46 ten-hour days during the year.

Mississippi Delta Peach Culture 



By L. R. FARISHi 



In past years tree fruit production in 
general, and peach production in par- 
ticular, was believed to be more con- 
fined mainly to areas of higher eleva- 
tions. Most men who were considered 
authorities on peaches warned against 
planting the trees in valleys of low ele- 
vations. 

This is because the cold air on frosty 
nights settles from higher to lower ele- 
vations and often causes more frost in- 
jury to the fruit buds, blossoms or young 
fruit on trees at the bottom than at the 
top of the hill. If the valley is narrow 
with hills nearby on either side, the cold 
air will settle into the valley from both 
directions and often causes much frost 
injury, and some . years the whole fruit 
crop is lost. This trouble is also apt to 
occur at the bottom of the "foot hills" 
on the east side of the Delta where the 
cold air settles down to level land from 
the adjacent hills. 

However, it does not seem to occur in 
the open Delta area several miles from 
the "foot hills". The indications are, 
from observations made at various times, 
that no more frost injury to peaches oc- 
curs in the middle of the Mississippi 
Delta than in the hills section of this 
state of the same latitude. In other words^ 
trees grown in a large valley several miles 
from a hill do not seem to be affected by 
the settling of cold air from higher to 
lower elevations. 

Some very good fruit has been produc- 
ed in recent years in some of the small 
peach orchards of the Mississippi Delta 
plantings and some of the well-drained 
Delta soils seem to be well adapted to 
peach production. 

Propagation of Peach Trees 

Peach trees are usually budded on 
peach seedlings grown from Tennessee 

^Horticulturist at the Delta Branch Experi- 
ment Station, Stoneville, Mississippi. 



native peach seeds. The seeds are strati- 
fied for approximately 3 months before 
planting out in the nursery rows in early 
spring. 

Seeds are stratified by placing in some 
moist medium such as sand. Place a lay- 
er of sand in a box, then a layer of seed. 
Repeat this until the box is full or all 
seeds are used, covering the top layer of 
seed with about two inches of sand. Place 
m a cool location and keep moist at all 
times, but do not allow water to stand 
in it. The box should have enough holes 
or cracks in the bottom to allow good 
drainage. 

The best temperature for stratification 
is from 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If 
a cold storage room is available at this 
temperature the box can be left in it for 
about three months, but if not, place in 
a cool shady place and leave exposed to 
the winter temperatures. 

The seedlings may be budded in late 
June if the trees grow off vigorously; 
then the tops are cut off to force out the 
inset buds approximately 15 days after 
budding. If this practice is followed, 
they may be transplanted to the orchard 
the following winter as "June-budded" 
trees. 

Another practice of producing the 
nursery stock is to bud them in August 
or early September and wait until the 
following spring to cut off the tops to 
force out the inset buds. The trees are 
grown in the nursery the remainder of 
that growing season and then transplant- 
ed to the orchard the second winter as 
1 -year-old trees. The top will be 1 year 
old and the roots 2 years old. The T-bud 
is the type of budding most commonly 
used with peaches. 

Location of the Orchard 
Convenience to home. The home or- 
chard will have better care and the frui. 
will have more protection from "visitors"

if it is set near the dweUing of the opera 
tor or caretaker. The house is usually 
located on a rise that affords good drain- 
age which is essential if peach trees are 
to grow properly. 

Soil adaption. Peach trees are adapted 
to a rather wide range of soil type. The 
subsoil must have good drainage as well 
as the top soil because peach roots ex- 
tend several feet into the ground in well- 
drained porous soil. It is essential for the 
trees to have a good root system in order 
to have a great absorption capacity dur- 
ing dry periods of the summer months. 
Trees grown in a heavy, poorly-drained 
soil do not form an extensive root system, 
and as a result, the trees suffer badly 
from the lack of root absorption capacity 
during summer droughts. 

Delta sandy loam and silt loam soils 
with well-drained subsoils are considered 
good peach soils, while most buckshot 
soils are not good peach soils because of 
their poor internal drainage. 

Avoid setting new orchards behind old 
one. Some farmers have a certain area 
set aside for a home orchard and when 
one peach tree is removed, another is set 
in the same spot. This is a bad practice 
because roots of the old trees often car- 
ry disease organisms that will attack the 
roots of the new trees. If nematodes are 
present on roots of the old trees, they are 
almost certain to attack roots of the 
young peach trees if set in the sam-: 
place. 

Another objection to setting new peach 
trees where old ones have been removed 
is the fact that roots of old peach trees 
become toxic to the roots of new trees 
planted in the same place where the old 
ones were grown. This toxic effect on 
the roots retards the growth of the young 
trees. 

A good example of this was observed 
in a young peach variety planting at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station, Stone- 
ville, Mississippi. The test with an old 



orchard was completed and the trees 
pulled in the late summer of 1942. 
Young peach trees for a variety test were 
set the following winter (1942-43) in the 
same locations where the old ones had 
been removed. Then 1 year later another 
variety planting was made in the same 
orchard. This planting was in the same 
.'■ows but half way between the trees set 
m ihe winter of 1942-43. It was observed 
that the trees set in the winter of 1942-43 
in the locations where the old peach 
trees had been removed did not grow at 
all satisfactorily. They were fertilized 
well with nitrate of soda but still the 
growth was depressed. The trees set a 
year later half way between the sites 
from which the old ones had been re- 
moved grew normally. At the end of the 
growing season of 1944 the trees that had 
grown in the orchard for only one year 
were larger than those that had grown 
there 2 years, and in the late summer 
of 1945 the 2-year-old trees were larger 
th.nn the 3-year-old ones. 

Measurements and photographs (figure 
1 ) were taken of both lots of trees in th^ 
winter of 1946-47 after the younger 
group had grown in the orchard 3 years 
and the older ones 4 years. The measure- 
ments (table 1) show that the average 
trunk diameter and top area of the 
younger trees were much greater than 
that of tb: older ones. 

Both groups of trees were grown in 
the same rows and had the same cultural 
treatments except that the older trees 
were given a higher nitrate application 
than the younger ones in order to over- 
come some of the dwarfing effects. The 
toxic effect of the old peach roots on the 
4-year-old trees is believed to be respon- 
sible for the dwarfing of these trees. 

Choice of Varieties 

Peach variety studies have been con 
ducted at the Delta Branch Experiment 
Station for a number of years. Yield 
records have been kept of individual

were grown half way between the sites where the old peach trees had been remov-

old peach trees on the roots of these trees, while the growth of the 3-year-old trees was normal.

*The 4-year-old trees were set in the spots where the old trees had been removed and the

been removed. Roots of the old trees were toxic to the 4-year-old trees. Dwarfing of this group 
of trees was the result. 



ed. Late varieties are more apt to become 
infested with Oriental fruit moth larvae 
and brown rot than the early or mid- 
season varieties. The early or mid-season 
varieties are also in more demand than 
late ones in certain localities. The ability 
to withstand handling is very important. 
Some varieties, such as Golden Jubilee 
and Oriole, have good eating quality but 



trees and fruit buds examined after hard 
freezes to determine their ability to with 
stand low temperatures. Eating quality 
of the fresh, frozen and canned products 
from some of the varieties have been stu- 
died. Tree vigor and hardiness have also 
been observed for a number of the va- 
rieties.

are not desirable commercial varieties be- 
cause of their poor handling qualities. 

Some of the popular older varieties and 
more promising new ones that have 
been tested here are described briefly be- 
low in groups according to ripening per- 
iods. 

Very Early Varieties 
Dixiered. This is a new variety de- 
veloped by the Bureau of Plant Industry 
at Fort Valley, Georgia. It is very early, 
ripening about a week later than May- 
l lower. It has good eatmg quality for a 
peach ripening at that season, and the 
flesh is yellow which is usually preferred 
over the white flesh. 

Early Varieties 
Redhaven. This is a very attractive 
early peach, ripening about 3 weeks later 
than Mayflower. It is said to be a little 
small in some localities but his "sized 
up" well in the Delta Branch Experiment 
Station. It is a fairly good canning and 



freezing peach and is considered good 
for peach pickles. However, the fruit 
buds and trees do not seem to be very 
hardy. 

Oriole. The flavor is extra good in 
this variety, but it is too small and to; 
soft for commercial handling. It is recom- 
mended only for home use. 

Cumberland. None of the peaches ex- 
cel this one in setting fruit buds, and 
they are very hardy. However, the quali- 
ty is just fair and very soft for handling 
or for canning. It is suggested only for 
home use. 

Golden Jubilee. I'his is a large yel- 
low peach which has borne well at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station for the 
past 2 years. The fruits are large and at- 
tractive but are too soft for commercial 
handling or for canning. It has good 
fresh eating quality and also good freez- 
ing quality. 



MISSISSIPPI DELTA PEACH CULTURE

Medium Early Varieties 

Sunhigh. This is a new variety which 
IS becoming very popular as a commer- 
cial peach in the East. It has good eat- 
ing and canning qualities and is a very 
attractive peach with a yellow firm 
flesh of fine texture. It should become 
a popular peach in this locality. 

Halehaven. This variety has become 
very popular in many areas in recent 
years. It is an attractive peach with good 
eating, canning, and freezing qualities. 
Some objections have been raised on its 
size in some localities, but it has "sized 
up" well in the Delta. 

Vedette. This is a good peach, but it 
ripens the same time as the Halehaven 
and has not proved to be any better 
than the latter at the Delta Experiment 
Station. 

Hiley. The eating quality of this 
peach is good. It is a white peach and is 
similar to the Belle of Georgia except 
that it is about 10 days earlier than 
the latter. 

Triogem. This variety is rather new 
in this locality but has looked very good 
at the Delta Branch Experiment Station 
the past 3 years. The flesh is rather 
firm and is a good canning peach. 

Ambergem. This is a clingstone yel- 
low peach with very high quality after 
it has been processed for canning. The 
flesh is very firm and handles well, but 
it is a little tough for eating fresh; how- 
ever, it becomes a very fine texture and 
has a pleasing taste when canned. It 
is excellent for peach pickles but must 
be processed longer than most varieties. 

Main Crop Varieties 
Belle of Georgia. This is the most 
popular white peach in this area. The 
fresh eating quality is of the best among 
peaches, but it is a litde soft for com- 
mercial handling. It is considered good 
for canning so far as white peaches are 
concerned, but white peaches are not as 
popular for canning as yellow ones. 



Early Elberta. This is a very beauti- 
ful large yellow peach of high quality 
for eating fresh, canning or freezing. It 
is about a week earlier than Elberta, is 
not as firm as the Elberta, and has more 
peach fuzz than does most varieties. 

Elberta. For many years this has been 
the "Peach King" in commercial plant- 
ings, and it is still the most popular var- 
iety on the market. It is large, fairly 
firm, and good for canning or for freez- 
mg. It produces well. 

Setting the Orchard 

Type of trees and their care from nur- 
sery to orchard. A grower may pur- 
chase from most southern nurseries eith 
er "June-budded" or "year-old" trees. 
The "June-budded" trees are usually 
cheaper and if they are vigorous plants 
are often more desirable in many res- 
pects than the "year-old" trees. The old- 
er trees have often been stunted by be- 
ing over-crowded in the nursery row; and 
the branches are usually in the wrong 
place or poorly shaped. Desirable 
branches are more apt to form at the 
proper locations on young trees than on 
older ones. The "June-budded" trees 
have a greater root system in proportion 
to the top, and they usually grow faster 
and often are larger at the end of the 
second year than older trees. 

When the trees are taken from the 
nursery, they should be dug with a good 
root system and the trees picked up im- 
mediately and handled carefully in or- 
der not to injure either the tops or 
roots. The roots should be kept covered 
and not allowed to become dry. 

If the trees are purchased from a nur- 
sery, they should be unpacked and 
"heeled in" immediately after receiving 
them, being sure that all the roots are 
covered with moist soil. Trees are "heel- 
ed in" by digging a trench, placing the 
young trees in this trench with the tops 
extending upward in a slanting posidon, 
and then covering the roots with moist

soil. It is better that the trees be "heeled 
in" near the new orchard and only a few 
trees taken up at a particular time, be- 
ing certain that they are transplanted 
immediately to avoid drying of the roots. 

Time, distance and method of setting 
trees. Peach trees may be set in this 
locality any time during the dormant 
period, mid-winter being a good time 
for transplanting them. 

The rate of tree growth, which is 
determined by the orchard care and soil 
fertility, determines the planting dis 
tance that should be used in setting a 
peach orchard. If good care is given the 
trees grown in fertile, well-drained soil, 
they will grow large and should be set 
in rows from 25 to 30 teet apart and the 
trees 20 feet or more apart -in the row. 

Some growers set the trees on a square 
(25 X 25 ft.) However, if the rows are 
wider apart than the trees in the row, it 
makes the spraying and care of the or- 
chard more convenient than if set on a 
square. Rows 30 feet apart with the 
trees 20 feet apart in the row allow am- 
ple room between rows for orchard op- 
erations. This distance is satisfactory for 
peach trees on most Delta soil; however, 
It might be best to space the trees in 
the row 22 or 24 feet apart in some of 
the most fertile Delta soils. If thv° 
branches begin to interlock in the row, 
they can be cut back some on the two 
sides of the tree which will prevent 
crowding. 

The holes for setting the trees should 
be large enough to prevent crowding of 
roots in the hole, and the roots should 
be spread out in all directions if possi- 
ble- The tree should be set 2 or 3 inches 
deeper than it grew in the nursery. It 
is better to place about three shovels full 
of loose soil and tamp it well before 
filling the hole. 

Cultural Practices 
Sod Culture. Sod culture, using both 
grasses and legumes separately, and the 



two combined, have been used very suc- 
cessfully in apple and pear orchards. 
This practice seems to be successful in 
this locality as it is elsewhere with these 
two crops. Sod culture has also been 
fairly satisfactory with peaches in some 
localities under certain conditions; how- 
ever, the degree of success with peaches 
has been more confined to special con- 
ditions than is true with its use in apple 
and pear production. 

When sod culture is used in peach 
orchards, the herbage should be clipped 
Wxth a mower rather frequently during 
the spring and early summer. Sometimes 
a straw or legume mulch is used around 
each tree in combination with the sod 
culture. This system seems to be more 
satisfactory with peaches in most areas 
than sod culture without the mulching. 

Clean culture. Many of the commer- 
cial peach growers in other states prac- 
tice clean cultivation without any herb- 
age growing in their orchards at any 
season of the year. This may not be 
the best system, but when it is practiced, 
it is usually necessary to apply nitrogen 
fertilizers in some form each year in or- 
der to keep the trees growing vigorously. 
If ample fertilizers are applied, this sys- 
tem seems to be satisfactory in some 
areas. In fertile soils, it is not always nec- 
essary to add a great deal of fertilizer 
each year. 

Clean culture in summer plus legume 
cover crops in winter. Many of the 
more successful peach growers supply a 
part, or all, of the nitrogen for their 
trees by growing a winter legume covei 
crop in the orchard and disking it in 
each spring. Vetch, winter peas, and bur 
clover are some of the crops often used 
in peach orchards. This system seems 
to be very satisfactory in the Mississippi 
Delta, and bur clover seems to be well 
adapted to Delta soils for this purpose. 

Cultural Studies Conducted at Delta 
Experiment Station 

In 1943 a preliminary cultural test was

Figure 3. A row of 5-yc.ii-(»ld iicti ^'kjvnu iti 

initiated at the Delta Experiment Station 
to determine whether or not it would be 
practical to grow peaches in this locality 
under sod culture. The following treat- 
ments were used: (1) sod, (2) clean 
culture, and (3) clean culture in summer 
plus bur clover as a winter cover crop. 
This was set up in a young orchard 
which was set for a variety planting. 
The cultural treatments ran across the 
varieties which were set in straight rows 
with one variety in each row. Each cul- 
tural treatment was two trees wide and 
five trees long, and each treatment had 
two trees of each of the five varieties. 
Trunk measurements as well as height 
and spread of tree measurements were 
taken in the winter of 1946-47, which 
was the end of the fifth growing season 
in the . orchard. Photographs were also 
taken in the spring of 1947 or repre- 
sentative trees in the sod culture and in 
the cultivated block (figures 3, 4 and 5). 
All three of the tree measurements

(table 3) were greater in the cultivated 
treatments than in the sod treatments, 
and the average yield per tree of market- 
able fruit over 2% inches in diameter 
was much greater in the cultivated 
blocks. The percent of living trees in 1946 
was also greater in the cultivated 
plots. Each of the three tree measure- 
ments was greater in the bur clover 
treatments than in the cultivated ones 
vv^ithout a cover crop, but there was no 
difference in the average yield of mar- 
ketable fruit per tree in these treatments 
for the years 1945 and 1946. 

Table 4 gives the three tree measure- 
ments and percent living plants of 2-year- 
old trees grown in four different cul- 
tural treatments. This table shows that 
nitrogen increased the growth of trees 
grown in sod and also in clesn culture. 
Cultivated trees were much larger than 
the ones in sod, and cultivated trees with 
no fertilizer were larger than those in 
sod with nitrogen applied.

Growing crops between peach rows. 

No production is expected for the first 
2 years, and sometimes very little is ob 
tained the third year after setting the 
peach trees. Another cash crop, such as 
cotton or soybeans, may well be grown 
between the peach rows for the first 2 



years and even during the third year if 
a crop of fruit does not set. No summer 
cash crop should he planted between the 
peach rows after they come into full 
production. Tall growing crops, such as 
corn and sunflowers, should not be 
planted in the peach orchard at any

time. When other crops are grown in 
the young peach orchard, they should 
not be planted too close to the young 
trees. Ample space should be left be- 
tween the trees and other crops to allow 
cultivation of the trees without injuring 
them. 

Fertilization 

Although peaches require a complete 
fertilizer for maximum product-ion in 
some of the sand hills of the South At- 
lantic Coastal States, they seem to re- 
spond only to applications of nitrogen on 
the fertile soils of the Mississippi Delta. 
Nutritional studies at the Delta Experi- 
ment Station indicate that peaches do 
not respond to applications of either 
phosphorus or potash on the Deer Creek 
loam soil. Observations made at the Del- 
ta Station indicate that bur clover, used 
as a winter cover crop, supplies an ample 
amount of nitrogen to bearing peach 
trees and that no extra nitrogen is need- 



ed where a good crop of bur clover is 
grown each year. 

According to observations made, the 
indications are that an economiccal meth- 
od of peach culture in this locality would 
be to grow either cotton or soybeans as 
a cash crop between the peach rows for 
the first 2 years after setting the orchard. 
Apply approximately Vi pound of nitrate 
of soda per tree per year for these 2 
years; then seed the orchard to bur clov- 
er in the late summer of the second year, 
let the bur clover mature seeds the first 
spring before disking, and let it mature 
seed every 2 or 3 years thereafter. 

Bearing peach trees in this locality 
which do not have a winter legume 
growing around them should be fertiliz- 
ed with some kind of nitrogen fertilizer. 
The early spring is a good time to make 
this nitrigen application, and it should 
be scattered under the spread of the 



MISSISSIPPI DELTA PEACH CULTURE 



13 



trees' branches and disked into the 
soil. 

Trees from 3 to 5 years old should 
have from 1 to 2 pounds of nitrate of soda 
or its equivalent per tree each year. Trees 
6 years old or more of age should have 
from 2 to 4 pounds of nitrate of soda 
or its equivalent per tree each year. 

Older trees with poor vigor need more 
nitrogen to stimulate new growth than 
do thrifty trees. Trees in poor soil will 
also need more nitrogen to keep the 
trees growing vigorously than do those 
in fertile soil. As a general rule, peach 
trees growing in good Delta soils do not 
require as much nitrogen as trees in the 
sand hills. • 

Pruning 

Training the young trees. The most 
critical stage in developing a well formed 
peach tree is during the first two grow- 
ing seasons in the orchard. The pruning 
given during these first years is known 
as "training" and this is very important 
to form a tree with the proper shape and 
strong crotches between the main trunk 
and scaffold limbs. This training should 
begin at the time of setting in the or- 
chard, if the young trees contain any 
branches. 

The undesirable branches, those with 
sharp crotches and those out of place, 
should be removed. Some of the ones left 
may need cutting back; however, ^'June- 
budded" trees with no branches will not 
usually need any pruning before the 
voung branches start out in the spring. 
Then the desirable ones in the proper 
locations should be selected and the oth- 
ers removed. They may be pinched off 
if removed when very young and ten- 
der. 

The young trees should be gone over 
two or three times during the first 
spring and summer to remove undesira- 
ble branches or those in the wrong lo- 
cations; then thev should be gone over 
once or twice the second spring and 



once the second winter to remove 
branches that are out of place. The trees 
will be fruiting the third year if they 
grow properly. 

Pruning the bearing trees. There is 
very little summer pruning to be done 
after the peach trees come into bearing, 
which is usually the third growing sea- 
son in the orchard. Water suckers grow- 
mg out of place may be removed during 
the summer, but one good pruning dur- 
ing the dormant season is usually suf- 
ficient for most bearing trees. Pruning 
for the first 3 bearing years of the peach 
trees should be mostly a "thinning out ' 
of the small and weak branches and also 
those crowding in the tree. If some of 
the branches are growing too tall, thev 
may be cut back some to keep them 
within reasonable bounds. However, it 
does not seem practical to head back 
peach trees in the Mississippi Delta, as 
low as is the common practice in some of 
the commercial peach areas of Georgia 
and South Carolina. They grow too rap- 
idly and too large on good well-drained 
soil in this locality to attempt to make 
dwarf trees of them. The large trees give 
higher production under favorable grow- 
ing conditions. 

Heading back older trees. After peach 
trees have been bearing for several year-^ 
in fertile soil of this locality, some of 
them have a tendency to form long 
slender branches with most of the fruit- 
ing surface on the ends of these branches. 

Under such conditions, the fruit is too 
far from the trunk and the branches 
have a tendency to break or split and 
the production of large fruits might be 
reduced. In other instances, the branches 
might become injured with scale or bv 
machinery. Under either of these condi- 
tions, it is usually advisable to cut back 
the main branches from 3 to 5 feet from 
the trunk and form a new head of bear- 
ing wood. A crop of fruit will be lost 
the first year after cutting back, but a 
fair crop will be expected the second 



14

year and a full crop the third year. 

This kind of treatment often puts 
some trees back into production that 
might otherwise become unprofitable to 
keep in the orchard. It is usually not 
advisable to give all the trees in the or- 
chard this treatment at once unless the 
fruit buds have been killed by a hard 
freeze; it is then often advisable to do 
some rather heavy cutting back of older 
trees. 

Fruit Thinning 

Fruit thinning is a very important 
step in the production of large fancy 
peaches in this locality. Thrifty trees us- 
ually set more fruit than they can devel- 
op into a high percentage of attractive 



peaches. Although thinning of the fruits 
might not increase the total pounds or 
bushels of fruit, it greatly increases the 
percent of large fancy fruit. Since the 
large size fruits are much more valuable 
than the small ones, the total value of the 
crop is usually increased by thinning 
when the fruit set is heavy. When the 
fruit set is light, it might not always pay 
to thin. 

Thinning is usually started when th^ 
young peaches are about the size of quail 
eggs and continued until finished. The 
job should be finished before fruits are 
the size of bantam hen eggs. When per- 
forming the thinning operations, all the 
deformed fruits and those damaged by in- 



MISSISSIPPI DELTA PEACH CULTURE 



15 



sects should be removed. Only the large 
normal shaped ones should be left and 
they should not be touching each other. 
The crevices between touching fruits of 
fer perfect protection for insects anii 
disease organisms to gain an entrance. 
Therefore, this danger should be cor- 
rected at fruit thinning time. 

No set rule can be laid down on the 
exact number of fruit to leave on each 
twig because a large vigorous branch can 
support two or three times as much fruit 
as a small weak twig of the same length. 
In case a vigorous shoot has only a few 
fruits set and they are all within a short 
distance on the twig, two or three fruits 
may be left fairly close together and still 



develop into large peaches, provided 
they are located in such a manner that 
they will not touch each other before 
maturity. On thrifty twigs the fruit 
should average 4 to 6 inches apart. 

The young fruits should be destroyed 
or buried soon after being removed 
from the trees. This practice will destroy 
many curculio larvae that would other- 
wise develop into adult beetles which 
lay the eggs for the later generation of 
worms attacking the peaches at the rip 
ening stage. In other words, the worm 
infestation of ripe fruits can be reduced 
by a careful thinning job, provided the 
young peaches are destroyed soon after 
being removed from ihe trees.

Harvesting the Crop 

Peaches which are to be eaten fresh or 
frozen immediately after harvest should 
be picked when fully ripe, but if the 
fruits are soft, they will not stand much 
handling. In other words, tree-ripened 
peaches must be handled like eggs to 
avoid bruising. The main peaich crop 
which is to be handled commercially 
must be picked before the fruits becomxe 
soft. They are usually picked by color 
at the stage called "firm ripe." 

A careful worker can soon learn the 
color of some of the leading varieties which 
appear just before the fruits become 
soft. This is the correct stage of ripen- 
ing to harvest the crop. The fruits can be 
handled at this stage much better than 
they can after they become soft. Howev- 
er, careful handling must be employed 
at all times from the tree to the con- 
sumer in order to prevent bruising. Th." 
fruits might be bruised rather easily ev- 
en if they are still firm. 

The baskets of fruit should be handled 
with care as well as the individual fruit, 
and the hauling of the crop over rough 
ground should also be done very care- 
fully to avoid bruising. Baskets of fruit 
kept over night should be in a room or 
shed with a continuous air circulation. If 
some of the crop is held for 2 days or 
more, it should be in a refrigerated room 
at temperatures slightly above freezing. 

Control of Disease and Insect Pests 

The old adage of "an ounce of pre 
vention is better than a pound of cure" 
is certainly true in the control of peach 
disease and insect pests. If the grower 
waits until his fruit become badly in- 
fested with brown rot or curculio before 
starting the control measures, he is most 
certain to lose the bulk of his current 
crop. However, if he starts early in the 
season and makes timely applications of 
the correct materials in the proper man- 



ner, and practices sr.nitary control in con- 
nection with spraying or dusting, he can 
expect a reasonable degree of success. 
Good spraying is usually more effective 
than dusting, but good dusting is con- 
sidered better than a poor spraying job. 

In order to do a good job of spraying, 
it is essential to have a good power spray 
machine. An auxiliary motor and tank 
holding 300 gallons or more of liquid 
is almost essential to do a good job of 
spraying a commercial peach orchard. 
A small machine might be used in a 
small orchard, but it is usually difficult 
to do a satisfactory spraying job with a 
Miiall machine. 

Workers at the Delta Experiment Sta- 
tion have tried spraying both from the 
ground and from the top of the spray 
tank, and they much prefer the latter. 
This system only requires two men, one 
to do the spraying from the tank and 
the other to drive the tractor. The 
machine is kept moving all the time, 
slowly for large trees and faster for small 
ones. It makes a round trip for each row; 
goes up one side and back on the other, 
spraying the trees from both directions. 
A "broom" type of gun with six noz- 
zles is used, and the regulator set so that 
the pressure reads approximately 400 
pounds on the pressure guage. 

If the peach orchard is set in an open 
field away from woods, creek banks, and 
ditch banks, which provide good hiber- 
nation quarters for curculio, good con- 
trol of peach pests is usually much easier 
to obtain. If the infested fruits and the 
"drops" and young fruits removed in 
thinning are also destroyed, the pest in- 
festation of the orchard is likewise re- 
duced. 

Refer to the Mississippi Spray Calen- 
dar for details' on the materials to use 
for specific pests and the proper times 
of application.

SUMMARY 

(1) Peaches can be successfully grown in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta on good 
soils. The trees are usually propagated by budding on Tennessee peach seedlings. 

(2) The orchard should be located near the dwelling of the attendant and should 
be on well-drained soil. The young peach orchard should not be set immediately 
on an old site. 

(3) Not more than 10 or 12 varieties would be desired in a home orchard and 
less th.ui this number in commercial plant. ngs. Some of the newer varieties are recom- 
mended, and others look very promising 

(4) Young, vigorous, either "june-budded" or "year-old" trees should be used, 
and they should be set in the orchard or "heeled in" immediately upon arrival. They 
should be set during the dormant season. Mid-winter is a good time for the planting. 
Trees should be set 2 or 3 inches deeper in the orchard than they grew in the nursery. 

(5) Cultural studies at the Delta Experiment Station indicate that peaches must 
be cultivated for best results in the Delta area. Cultivation of peaches in this locality 
seems to be as essential as cultivation of cotton. Peach trees grown in sod did very 
poorly at Stoneville. A low-growing crop may be grown between the young peach 
rows until the trees come mto production 

(6) Peach trees in the fertile Delta soils seem to respond only to nitrogen fertilizer. 
This may be supplied with applications of mineral nitrogen fertilizer or by growing 
a crop of bur clover each year in the orchard. 

(7) Pruning during the first two years in the orchard consists entirely of training 
the young trees. This may be done mostly during the growing season but some may 
also be done in the dormant period. Pruning of the bearing trees consists mostly of 
thinning out the weak and thick branches, and this is done almost entirely in the 
dormant season. Old trees may sometimes need heading back to encourage new 
growth. 

(8) Fruit thinning is a practical process and it often is necessary in order to 
produce large fancy fruit. 

(9) That portion of the crop used for eating fresh or home freezing may be har- 
vested when soft or tree ripened, but the bulk of the crop that is handled commercially 
must be picked when 'firm ripe" in order to handle it. The crop must be handled 
with care at all times to avoid bruising. 

(10) Thorough application of adapted insecticides and fungicides at the proper 
times, is most essential in the control of peach disease and insect pests. A good spray 
machine is necessary to do a satisfactory job of spraying and workers at the Delta 
Station prefer making the application with the operator standing on top of the spray 
tank provided a large machine is used. Refer to the Mississippi Spray Calendar for 
details on the time of application and materials to use.

COTTON VARIETIES IN THE YAZOO-MISSISSIPPI DELTA 

By JAMES B. DICK and SIDNEY G. BRAIN 



Cotton variety tests have been conduct- 
ed for many years by the Delta Branch 
Station at Stoneville and upon planta- 
tions in representative sections of the 
Yazoo-Mississippi alluvial area to obtain 
information concerning the relative per- 
formance of the leading varieties with 
production conditions approximating those 
under which cotton is grown in the Del- 
ta. A continuous effort is made to adapt 
the variety tests to the current needs of 
producers, buyers, spinners, and oil mill 
operators, and to furnish information to 
all who are interested in the characteris- 
tics of the varieties of cotton tested. 

More attention is being given to the 
spinning quality of cotton than ever be- 
fore. Fiber properties which influence 
yarn strength and spinning quality most 
are length, tensile strength, and uniform- 
ity. These properties are reported upon, 
as in the three previous years. Other 
characteristics which have been determin- 
ed are: Yield of seed cotton and of lint 
in pounds per acre, gin turn-out, number 
of bolls required to make a pound of seed 
cotton, earliness, and total money value 
per acre based upon Middling, Strict Low 
Middling, and Low Middling grades. 

The yields of seed cotton are based up- 
on the weights harvested from ten one- 
row plots at each location each season. 
The yields of lint are based upon the re- 
spective yields of seed cotton and gm 
turn-outs. 

Gin turn-out values are the results of 
ginning ten lOO-boU samples from each 
variety for each location. 

The staple lengths of each variety for 
each location are determinations by class - 
ers of the State Cotton Cooperative As- 
sociation, Greenwood, Mississippi, and of 
the Greenwood Office of the Board of 
Cotton Examiners, Production and Mar- 
keting Administration, U. S. Department 
of Agriculture. 

The sizes of bolls are based upon the 



average weight of ten lOO-boU samples 
from each variety at each location. 

The percentage of cotton from the first 
picking, which is considered a measure 
of earliness, is calculated by dividing 
the weight of the first picking by the 
weight of the total production. 

The fiber tensile strength and the length 
uniformity of fiber are the findings from 
tests made of these cottons in the Knox- 
ville Laboratory of the Division of Cot- 
ton and Other Fiber Crops, U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 

The money values per acre are based 
upon: (1) Yields of seed and lint, (2) 
staple lengths, and (3) seed grades. The 
values for three grades — Middling, Strict 
Low Middling, and Low Middling — are 
given. The average prices for cotton 
of the respective grades and several 
lengths are for 10 weeks of the 1946 
marketing season, Memphis market. The 
seed is evaluated upon a basis of $70 per 
ton, with premiums and discounts in 
accordance with official standards for 
grading cottonseed set up by the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture. The seed 
analyses were made by the Barrow-Agee 
Laboratory, Inc., Leland, Mississippi. 

Differences representing significance be- 
tween varietal averages for each of the 
characteristics are included in the bot- 
tom two lines of the tables. To be con- 
sidered significant, the differences be 
tween any two varietal averages in a col- 
umn must be greater lh:m the item de- 
signated as "barely significant." 

Rainfall was ample at each test loca- 
tion and original stands for the 1946 tests 
were good to excellent. Abnormally li :. 
rainfall during the early growing season 
was followed by a dry, late growing sea- 
son and an excellent harvesting season. 

The current report is divided into two 
parts: (1) The 1946 tests, and (2) the 
average of 2- and 3-year tests at the same 
location.

COTTON VARIETIES IN THE YAZOO-MISSISSIPPI DELTA 



5 



Results of the 1946 Variety Trials 

The 1946 variety trials were located at 
Stoneville, Tunica, Jonestown, Money. 
Valley Hill, Yazoo City, and Kelso Plan- 
tation, Gary, Mississippi. There are 12 
varieties of cotton included. Most of 
them are grown commercially in the Del- 
ta. 

In each test the varieties are arranged 
according to the average of the money 
value per acre for the 3 grades: Middling, 
Strict Low Middling, and Low Middling. 

Stoneville Test 

The Stoneville test was located at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station. The 
soil is a sandy loam, typical of the banks 
along upper Deer Greek. A nitrogenous 
fertilizer was "bedded on" about 2 weeks 
before planting. The test was planted 
on April 21. The first picking was made 
September 9, and the second picking on 
October 24. Results of the test are giv- 
en in table 1. 

The leading varieties in the Stoneville 
test, based upon the average of the rank- 
ings of money value per acre for Mid- 
dling, Strict Low Middling, and Low 
Middling grades were Stoneville 2B, Del- 
tapine 15, Delfos 9169, and Goker 100- 
Staple (1946). There was no difference 
in ranking of varieties for the 3 grades. 

Tun'ca Test 

In cooperation with E. G. (Gene) John- 
son, landowner, and H. J. Vickery, Coun- 
ty Agent, a variety test was conducted in 
the northern part of the Delta in Tun- 
ica County, 9 miles south of Tunica on 
Highway 61. The test was on Forrest- 
dale silty loam soil, classification num- 
ber 425, commonly known as white oak 
or white sandy land. A nitrogenous fer- 
tilizer was "bedded on" and the test 
planted on April 23. Excessive rainfall 
during May damaged the test to a Hmit- 
ed extent. Favorable conditions during 
June and July were followed by a hot, 
dry August. The plants were small but 
well fruited. The first picking was made 
on September 11, and the second pick- 



ing on October 22. Results of the Tun- 
ica test are given in table 2. 

The leading varieties were Bobshaw 1, 
Coker 100 Staple, Goker 100 Wilt, Miller, 
Delfos 651, and Stoneville 2B. 

Jonestown Test 

The test near Jonestown was conduct- 
ed in cooperation with Carey Cocke, Jr., 
farm operator, and Harris Barnes, Coun- 
ty Agent of Coahoma County, and was 
located on the Eagle Nest Plantation west 
of Jonestown. The soil is a sandy loam, 
generally well drained. A nitrogenous 
fertilizer was "bedded on" and the test 
planted on April 22. Excessive rains in 
fune damaged the west end of the test 
and dwarfed the plants. Growth through- 
out the balance of the test was rank with 
considerable boll rot. Pathogenic wilt was 
present but was probably of little con- 
sequence. The first picking was made 
October 8, and the second picking on 
December 16. Results of the Jonestown 
test are given in table 3. 

The varieties with highest average 
rankings are Deltapine 15, Coker 100 
Staple, Stoneville 2B, Coker 100 Wilt. 
Miller, and Bobshaw 1. 

Money Test 

The Money variety trial was conduct- 
ed in cooperation with H. L. Gary, presi- 
dent of Wildwood, Inc. The test was 
located on the east banks of the Talla- 
hatchie River on Wildwood Plantation. 
The soil is a fine sandy loam and is well 
drained. A nitrogenous fertilizer was 
"bedded on" and the test planted April 
26. Stands were very good. Boll weevils 
were plentiful late in the season. Heavy 
rains caused excessive growth and reduc- 
ed yields considerably. The first and 
second pickings were made on Septem- 
ber 20 and October 31, respectively. The 
results of the test conducted at Money are 
given in table 4. 

Leading varieties in the Money test 
were Delfos 651, Bobshaw 1, Stoneville 
2B, and Delfos 9169.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 445 



Valley Hill Test 

In cooperation with L. S. Hcriphill. 
landowner, a test was conducted ac Val- 
ley Hill in Carroll County about 6 miles 
east of Greenwood on Highway 82. Th? 
test is located at the eastern border of the 
Delta and is on a light colored, well 
drained silt loam made up of outwash 
from the hills. A nitrogenous fertilizer 
was "bedded on" before planting. The 
test was planted April 19. Good stands 
were obtained on most varieties but early 
"damping off" of seedlings resulted in 
irregular stands. However, later counts 
showed an average stand for all varieties. 
Damage from pathoo:enic wilt was 
severe on the De1fo<; S31C and Delfo? 
444 varieties. Cokcr 100 Wilt and Miller 
were highly resistent to the wilt. Boll 
wppvil infestation was hep-W, and the 
yield of all varieties was affected. First 
and second pickings were made on Sep- 
tpmher 19 and October 29. re<:nectively. 
The results of the Valley Hill test are 
given in table 5. 

Stoneville 2B, Miller, Bobshaw 1, Del- 
fos 9169, and Coker 100 Staple were the 
leading monev-vnlue-per-acre producers 
in the Vallev Hill test. 

Yazoo Ci*v Test 

Tn cooperation with Marx Schaefer, 
landowner, and A. R. Ruby, County 
Agent, the Yazoo Citv variety trial was 
conducted on the Schaefer Farm 3 miles 
west of Yazoo City. The soil is a fine 
sandy loam and is well drained. A nitro- 
genous fertilizer was "bedded on" and 
the test planted on April 18. The plants 
grew tall and the foliage was very 
heavy. Boll weevils appeared early and 
caused serious damage to all varieties, 
entirely destroying the top crop. The en- 
tire prduction was harvested on Septem- 
ber 30, and no data on "earliness" are 
available. Results of the Yazoo City 
test are given in table 6. 

Leading average money value produc- 
ers were Coker 100 Staple, Delfos 9169, 
and Stoneville 2B. 



Kelso Test 

The Kelso test was conducted in coop- 
eration with James Hand of Kelso Plan- 
tation and C. L. Cary, County Agent 
of Sharkey County. It is located on the 
Sharkey-Issaquena county line 11 miles 
south of Cary on Highway 61. The 
soil is very productive fine sandy loam, 
well drained, and typical of lower Deer 
Creek soil. The test was planted in check 
rows on April 29. The rows were 40 
inches apart each way and were culti- 
vated with four-row equipment through- 
out. Six plants were left in each hill. 
Excessive rains occurred during the early 
season and the boll weevil infestations 
were very heavy. The plants were tall 
with rank foliage. Considerable boll rot 
occurred. The cotton was late in opening, 
and the entire production was picked 
on November 22. No data on earliness 
were available. Results of the Kelso test 
are given in table 7. 

Deltapine 15, Stoneville 2B, Coker 100 
Staple (1946), and Miller were the high- 
est ranking varieties in total value per 
acre. 

Averages of Results from 2- and 3-Year 
Variety Studies 

The yield of cotton is greatly affected 
bv seasonal conditions. Average results 
of the several variety tests conducted at 
different locations in the Delta in any 
one year provide interesting and useful 
information on some varietal character- 
istics. It is believed that the average re- 
sults of tests conducted over a period of 
several years in a given locality provide 
the grower in the vicinity of the test 
or farming on a similar soil type, with 
more reliable information on the behav- 
ior of a variety under average conditions 
Average results of tests conducted at the 
same locality during the years from 1944 
to 1946 are given. 

Variet}' trials similar to those describ- 
ed above were conducted during the ^ 
years, 1944 to 1946, at Stoneville,

The staple lengths of all varieties were 
shorter than normal. Excessive amounts 
of rainfall during the planting, growing 
and harvesting seasons occurred at all 
locations in 1945. The amount of rain- 
fall during the early 1946 growing season 
was generally excessive, followed by a 



dry late growing season and excellent 
harvesting season. Staple lengths were 
about normal.

The yields of seed cotton were deter- 
mined by averaging the seed cotton 
yields obtained during each of the sea- 
sons that the tests were conducted at a 



given locality. The yield of lint was ob- 
tained by multiplying the average gin 
turn-out by the average yield of seed

picked during the first picking, the fiber 
tensile strength, and the fiber length uni- 
formity ratio, were determined by aver- 
aging the values obtained for each variety 
during the seasons that the tests were 
conducted at a given location. 

The total money values per acre for 
each grade were obtained by averaging 
the total money-per-acre values for the 
2- or 3- year period for that particular 
grade for each variety. Money values for 
Middling, Strict Low Middling and Low 
Middling grades were averaged, and in 
each table the varieties are arranged ac- 
cording to these averages. 

During the 3-year period, 1944-1946 
the leading varieties at Stoneville were 
Stoneville 2-B, Deltapine, Coker 100, and 
Bobshaw 1. 

Bobshaw 1, Coker 100, Stoneville 2B, 
Miller and Deltapine were the leading 



varieties at Tunica for the 2 years, 1944 
and 1946. 

At Jonestown the leading money-value 
producing varieties during the 2-year per- 
iod, 1945 and 1946, were Coker 100 Sta- 
ple, Deltapine, Delfos 9169, Bobshaw 1, 
Stoneville 2B and Miller. 

Leading varieties at Money for the 
3-year period were Bobshaw 1, Stone- 
ville 2B and Delfos 651. 

Stoneville 2B, Bobshaw 1, Miller and 
Coker 100 were leading money-value pro- 
ducers during the 3-year period at Valley 
Hill. 

Leading varieties at Yazoo City for the 
3-year period were Stoneville 2B, Coker 
100, Deltapine and Bobshaw 1. 

At Keso the highest ranking varieties 
were Stoneville 2B, Delfos 531C, Coker 
100 and Deltapine.

RESULTS OF FERTILIZER TESTS OF SUGARCANE IN 
MISSISSIPPI DURING PERIOD 1941-1946 

By I. E. STOKES and T. E. ASHLEY^ 



This report briefly summarizes the re- 
sults of ten fertilizer tests of sugarcane 
conducted at three locations in Missis- 
sippi during the period 1941 to 1946. 
The tests were designed^ to determine 
the general influence of several sources 
of nitrogen fertilizer mixtures, and meth- 
ods of application on yields of cane and 
sirup per acre rather than a critical eval- 
uation of specific fertilizer practices. 
However, the data furnish some prac- 
tical information related to the fertiliza- 
tion of sugarcane under certain soil and 
climatic conditions in Mississippi. Two 
varieties, Co. 290 and C. P. 29/116, were 
used in the tests. 

Tests were conducted on farms near 
Meridian and near Laurel, Mississippi, 
and on the South Mississippi Branch Sta- 
tion at Poplarville, Mississippi. The most 
uniform areas of soil available at each 
location were selected for the tests. A 
sandy phase of the Susquehanna soil ser- 
ies was utilized for the tests at Meridian; 
the tests at Laurel were conducted on a 
Ruston Atwood fine sandy loam soil; 
and Ruston sandy loam soil was used for 
the tests at Poplarville. In each case the 
soil was well drained and characterized 
by a slightly rolling topography.

bed preparation, methods of planting,

and cultivation were utilized at each lo- 
cation. The rate of planting in all of 
the tests was two stalks. Tests at Pop- 
larville were planted during the fall sea- 
son, usually about November 1. Tests 
at Laurel were planted in the spring, 
about March 15. One of the tests at 
Meridian, summarized in table 1, was 
planted in the spring and the other test 
ac that location; summarized in table 2, 
was planted in the fall. 

Standard commercial fertilizer mater- 
ials were used in all of the tests. Sour- 
ces of nitrogen are indicated for each 
test in tables 1 to 6. Phosphoric acid 
(P2O5) was obtained in each case from 20 
percent superphosphate. Potash was ob- 
tained in each case from muriate of pot- 
ash. 

Each treatment, in the tests, was repli- 
cated three times except in the test at 
Meridian, summarized in table 2, where 
the treatments were replicated four times. 
Plots approximately 1/100 acre were 
utilized in all of the tests. 

A uniform method of applying the 
fertilizer was followed in all tests. Fer- 
tilizer materials were applied during 
March in all treatments. Where two ap- 
plications were involved, the second ap- 
plication was applied during the latter 
part of June. Two applications were in- 
volved in all of the experiments except 
some of the treatments in the tests sum- 
marized in tables 1 and 6. 

Fall planted cane utilized for most of 
the tests was off-barred during the early 
part of March. Fertilizer treatments 
were then applied by hand in narrow 
bands on the bottom of the off-bar fur- 
rows approximately 3 inches from the 
cane and covered to a depth of approxi- 
mately 4 inches by harrowing the soil 
from the middles. The second applica- 
tion was applied in small furrows about

3 inches from the cane on each side of 
the rows, the fertihzer being covered im- 
mediately to a depth of about 4 inches 
during the cultivation operation. 

A variation from the general procedure 
described above for applying the fertil- 
izer was followed at Meridian in the test 
summarized in table 1; prior to the plant- 
ing operation phosphate (P2O5) was ap- 
plied and mixed thoroughly with the soil 
at a depth of approximately 1 inch below 
the furrow in which the cane was planted. 
The method of applying nitrogen in this 
test was the same as the general proce- 
dure described above for other tests. 

All of the tests were harvested, in ac- 
cordance with usual commercial practices, 
during the period November 1 to 15, ex- 
cept in a few cases where some of the 
second year stubble tests were harvested 
during the latter part of October. Yields 
of cane per acre were based on plot 
weights of stripped cane. Border rows 
on each plot were eliminated from plot 
weights to avoid the influence of border 
effect from the various fertilizer treat 
ments. 

Yields of sirup per ton of cane were 
based on sirup tests, conducted on a lab- 
oratory scale evaporator, that involved 



composited samples of juice extracted 
from field samples of from 15 to 25 
stalks selected at random from each plot 
of each treatment. 

Discussions 

The results of the fertilizer tests sum- 
marized in tables 2 to 6, inclusive, show 
that yields of cane and sirup per acre 
were improved in each case by the addi 
tion of fertilizer except in a single in- 
stance (table 6) where half of the fertil- 
izer was applied to second year stubble 
in March and the remainder in June. 
Yields observed in all tests no doubt were 
influenced to some extent by seasonal 
conditions and by physical conditions and 
original fertility of the soil. 

Results of tests given in table 1 vary, 
the observed yield of cane and sirup 
from approximately one-third of the to- 
tal number of fertilized plots being some- 
what lower than yields from the unfer- 
tilized check plots. Reason for the lower 
yields, as compared with increased yields 
from all other fertilized plots in these 
tests and increased yields from fertilized 
plots in other tests, is not apparent. How- 
ever, the variations in observed yields 
may have resulted from obscure varia- 
tions in physical conditions and fertility 
of the soil throughout the tract of deep

Measurable effects of the fertilizer 
treatments were more pronounced in the 
yields of cane per acre and were in turn 
reflected in yields of sirup per acre. 
Yields of sirup per ton of cane were not 
influenced greatly by the fertilizer treat- 
ments except in a few cases where high 
applications of nitrogen resulted in im- 
mature cane at the time of harvest which 
lowered the yields. Yields of cane and 
sirup per acre improved with successive 
increases in fertilizer applications within 
certain general limitations. 

The greatest response at each location 
was associated with the nitrogen appli- 
cations. Yields of cane and sirup per 
acre increased with increased applications 
of nitrogen up to from 40 to 60 pounds 
per acre. In some cases the increase in 
yields continued with higher applications 



of nitrogen, though the proportionate in- 
creases were less pronounced from appli- 
cations above 60 pounds per acre. The 
response to the nitrogen applications were 
influenced by seasonal conditions. 

Applications of from 96 to 120 pounds 
of nitrogen as compared to applications 
of from 40 to 60 pounds of nitrogen per 
acre, frequently lowered the yields of 
sirup per ton of cane, but usually result- 
ed in a slight increase in yield of cane 
and sirup per acre. In some instances 
applications of nitrogen supplemented by 
20 to 40 pounds of P1-O-, on Ruston sandy 
loam soil (table 5) resulted in better 
yields of cane and sirup, but in some 
other instances applications of nitrogen 
alone was as effective as when both BOs 
and nitrogen were used. 

On a Susquehanna soil (sandy phase) 
near Meridian (table 1) applications of 
100 pounds of P2O5 per acre as compared 
with no phosphate resulted in increased

yields of cane and sirup per acre. In 
other tests on that soil, and in tests on 
other soils, increasing the quantity of 
Pi-'On from 40 to 80 pounds or from 64 to 
128 pounds per acre without changing 
the quantities of nitrogen and potash re- 
sulted in an increase in yields of cane 
and sirup in some instances, while in 
other instances no increase in yield was 
ohtained. The more favorable effect of 
applying PlO- was in the case of stubble 
crops. 

Inorganic sources of nitrogen were 
equally as effective as cottonseed meal as 
measured by the yields of cane and sirup 
per acre from comparable treatments. 
In some instances the inorganic sources 
of nitorgen, ammonium sulphate in par- 
ticular, resulted in slightly higher yields 



than comparable treatments where cotton- 
seed meal was used as a source of nitro- 
gen, and in other instances the reverse 
was the case. 

The results as a whole do not show 
appreciable differences in yields from ef- 
fect of nitrogen from the inorganic sources 
used, cyanamid, nitrate of soda, and am- 
monium sulphate. Although the data 
(table 1) indicate slightly more favorable 
effect from PsO^ when inorganic sources 
of nitrogen were used than when cotton- 
seed meal was used, the results are too 
limited to serve as more than an indica- 
tion of possible effect. 

Summary 

1. Inorganic sources of nitrogen (cy- 
anamid, nitrate of soda, and ammonium 
sulphate) were equally as satisfactory as 



RESULTS OF FERTILIZER TESTS OF SUGARCANE IN MISSISSIPPI

cottonseed meal in the total production 
of a good quality of sirup per acre. 

2. Applications of nitrogen, usually 
from 20 to 60 pounds per acre improved 
the yields of cane and sirup per acre in 
essentially all tests; the response depend- 
ing largely upon the soil type and gen- 
eral fertility of the land. In some of the 
tests, applications of nitrogen higher than 
the 60 pounds per acre had a detrimental 
effect on yield of sirup per ton of cane 
and on yield of sirup per acre. 

Applications of 100 pounds of P-'Os per 
acre as compared to no phosphate on 
Susquehanna soil (sandy phase) gener- 
ally improved the yield of cane and sirup 
per acre. In other tests on that and on 
the other soils, increasing the quantity of 
Pi^O-. from 40 to 80 or from 64 to 128 
pounds per acre resulted in an increase 
in yields in some instances and no in- 
crease in other instances. The more 
favorable effect of applying P2O5 was in 
the case of stubble crops. 



3. Fertilizer applied in one applica- 
tion in March was as effective as when 
the same quantity was applied in two ap- 
plications, one in March and one in June, 
in most of the tests. Two applications 
gave better results in some of the second 
year stubble tests. 

4. Because of the widely varying soil 
types and soil fertility throughout the 
sugarcane growing area of Mississippi, it 
is not feasible to recommend kinds and 
quantities of fertilizer which will prove 
most suitable under all conditions. In 
general, based on the results from tests 
conducted at Meridian, Laurel, and Pop- 
larville, a mixed fertilizer high in nitro- 
gen such as a 6-8-4 (N, P.-Q-., K2O) should 
be applied at the rate of from 400 to 
800 pounds per acre, depending upon 
the soil type and previous crop history of 
the land. Light sandy soils, low in fer- 
tility require, in addition to the mixed 
fertilizer, a supplemental application of 
from 20 to 30 pounds of nitrogen per 
acre.

INTRODUCTION 



This report contains information both general and specific 
about the soils and agricultural practices of Quitman County. The 
main purpose of such a publication is to aid and assist the farmers 
of this county in making the best use of their land. Every farmer 
or landowner in the county will be given an individual soil map 
of his farm, together with this Bulletin which explains and gives 
the management recommendations for every soil type on the farm. 
With this information at hand each farmer in Quitman County 
can adjust the crops best suited to the various soils, establish 
proper drainage for every field, arrange the rows and locate roads, 
so that the farm as a whole will be managed in the most profitable 
manner. The farmers can call on the County Agent and other agri- 
cultural leaders for further details and assistance in planning 
their farm programs and for other information concerning the use 
of the soils on their farms. 



SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 

Recommended for 
QUITMAI^ COUNTY 

By C. G. Morgan* and H. B. Vanderford 

All soils are developed by nature with certain properties so that 
some are adapted for production of certain crops while others are 
adapted for growth of other crops, just as some cattle are suitable 
for the production of meat and others for the production of milk. 

The soils of Quitman County are derived from sediments trans- 
ported by four different streams: the Mississippi River, Coldwater 
River, Little Tallahatchie River, and the Yocona River, (figure 1). 
The inherent qualities of the sediments from these various streams 
and the forces of nature determine the type of soil that is formed. 
Crop adaptation, drainage, and fertilization vary widely on different 
soil types. 

It is the purpose of the soil survey to study and classify and 
map these different soils, then provide information that will aid 
the farmer in making the best practical use of each soil type on 
his farm. 

This bulletin is intended for use with accompanying soil map of 
the operator's farm. It contains directions for using the soil map, 
a discussion of general principles of soil management,2 and a dis- 
cussion of specific management for each soil type. The soil map 
shows the location of soil boundaries, the type and slope of soil in 
each area, roads, houses, ditches, and section lines. The discussion 
of management covers general soil management problems and 
describes the best adapted crops, rotations, fertilizers, and other 
practices for each soil type. 

Definitions 

Some general definitions and explanations are given to aid 
and assist the farmers in getting the full benefits of the report. 

1. Alluvium — material deposited by streams. 



iSoil Survey made by Thomas Fowlkes, L. A. Davidson, C. G. Morgan, J. A. Herren, 
G. E. Rogers, E. J. McNutt, and D. A. Yost, Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station

Conservation Service. 



^Management includes all practices relating to soil use (fertilizers, adapted crops, 
rotations, drainage, and row direction).

2. Colluvium — material deposited by gravity; colluvium is 
found at the foot of steep slopes or embankments. 

3. Complex — an area where it is impractical to separate the 
individual soils because two or more soils are mixed in a 
complicated pattern or the area is densely wooded. 

4. Depression — low places where water is slow to drain off 
or does not drain off. 

5. Escarpment — a steep bank or "jump off". 

6. Management — includes all practices relating to soil use 
such as fertilizers, adapted crops, rotations, drainage, and 
row direction. 

7. Fallow — a tillage practice where no crop is grown and the 
area is plowed frequently to kill weeds. 

Explanations 

1. The soil map is furnished through the county agent. To 
find what soils are on any farm or tract of land, the town- 
ship, range, and section number should be known. Then, 
by using land marks shown on the map, such as roads, 
streams, houses and other features, the exact location can be 
found. 

2. Each kind of soil mapped within the farm or tract is marked 
on the map with a syn^bol. This symbol is composed of three 
numbers. The first of the three numbers refers to the po- 
sition of the soil, the second to internal drainage, and the 
third to the texture of the surface (sand, silt or clay). For ex- 
ample, an area marked with the symbol 322 is a soil that 
occupies a low bottom position, has poor internal drainage, 
and has a clay surface. All areas marked with 322 are the 
same kind of soil. By looking in the "Legend of Soils" in the 
index, page 36, it can be seen that 322 refers to the soil type 
named Sharkey clay. 

3. In Quitman County there are ten groups of soils, according 
to the position and source of material from which they were 
developed. The soils formed from Mississippi River alluvium 
are shown on the maps as groups 200 through 400. The soils 
formed from mixed Mississippi River and Coldwater River al- 
luvium are shown as groups 500 through 800. The soils 
formed from Little Tallahatchie River and Yocona River are 
shown as groups T500 through T800. All of these groups are 
listed blow. 

Soils derived from Mississippi River Alluvium 

(a) Group 200, depressional soils. These soils occur in low 
wet places.

(b) Group 300, low bottom soils. These soils occur in back- 
water or slackwater areas of the Mississippi River flood 
plain. They are known locally as "buckshot" soils. 

(c) Group 400, low terrace soils. These soils usually occur on the 
highest elevations in the "delta," generally near old streams 
or bayous. They are acid in reaction and are known locally 
as ranging from "sandy soils" to "light buckshot." 

Soils Derived from Mixed Mississippi and Coldwater River 

Alluvium 

(d) Group 500, first bottom soils. These soils occur near the 
Coldwater River and consist of recently deposited alluvium 
of this stream. Most areas are overflowed frequently and 
are known locally as "made land". 

(e) Group 600, depressional soils. These soils are derived from, 
mixed Coldwater and Mississippi River alluvium and occur 
in low wet places similar to group 200. 

(f) Group 700, low bottom soils. These soils are derived from 
mixed Missdssippi and Coldwater River alluvium and 
occur in broad areas on the lowest elevations in the county. 
They are similar to soils in group 300 in most respects 
except that they overflow more frequently. 

(g) GrouD 800, low terrace soils. These soils are ^erived irom^ 
mixed Mississippi and Coldwater River alluvium and occur 
along the present Coldwater River channel and its tribu- 
taries. 

S0 I3 33eriv8d from Little Tallahatchis or Yocona River 

Alluvium 

(h) T500, first^ bottom soi^s These soils occur along the Little 
Tallahatchie or Yocona Rivers and consist of recently de- 
posited alluvium of these streams. Before the present Talla- 
hatchie River Canal was dug, most of the areas were over- 
flowed frequently. These soils are locallv known as "made 
land". 

(i) T600, depressional soils. These soils are derived from Little 
TalJahatchie or Yocona River alluvium and occur in low 
Vv^et places similar to group 200 soils. 

(j) T800, low terrace soils. These soils are derived from LittJe 
Tallahatchie and Yocona River alluvium and occur in the 
southeastern part of the county and are very acid in re- 
action. 



4. There are six degrees of internal drainage recognized in 
Quitman County, ranging from very poorly drained to ex-

cessively drained. The internal drainage generally governs 
the amount of surface run-off on a soil. 

5. The surface textures found are as follows: clay, silty clay, 
silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand. 
The surface texture governs how easily a particular soil is 
to till. 

6. To find what general soil management practices are ap- 
plicable to all soils in Quitman County see "General Soil 
Management," page 11. 

7. To find the drainage, crop adaptation, rotation and fertilizer 
recommendations for each individual soil type, see"Manage- 
ment by Soil Type,"' page 19. 

THE SOIL MAP AND ITS USE 

The soil map is a complete sketch of the farm, the same size as 
the AAA aerial photograph (scale 8 inch~ l mile). It is designed 
to show all important soil types as well as other material and 
artificial features such as rivers, bayous, roads, railroads, houses, 
ditches and section lines. (See "Legend of Symbols on the Soil 
Map," page 9). On the soil map there are two types of lines to 
indicate soil boundaries; one, a solid line (see symbol on page 10) 
which indicates an abrupt change in soil type; and the other, a 
dotted line (see symbol on page 10) which indicates a gradual 
change between two soil types. The number inside each separate 
area on the map is the symbol for the soil type in that area. The 
letter following a soil number indicates the slope of the soil. (See 
"Management by Soil Type," starting on page 19, for soil name 
and recommendations). 

To the individual farmer the soil map has many practical uses. 
By using the information discussed in this bulletin and suggestions 
from the Coimty Agent the soil map can be used to help each farm- 
er make more efficient use of the land on his farm, A natural 
system of secondary drainage can be laid out for each farm by lo- 
cating ditches in the center of the depressional soils shown on 
ihe soil map. By using the soil boundaries on the soil map as field 
boundaries more uniform field layouts and proper row direction 
can be determined for each farm. After fields have been laid out by 
soil types, each farmer can by experimentation determine the 
proper fertilization for the various soil types on his farm (see Coun- 
ty Agent). The soil map can also be used as a base map for locating 
roads and houses on each farm. 

LEGEND OF SYMBOLS ON THE SOIL MAP

457A. The letter following the soil number indicates the slope 
of the area. The absence of a letter or the use of A" shows 
that the area is depressional (no erosion problem); A° 
nearly flat (no erosion problem): A, slightly sloping, 1-4 
to 2 percent, (very little erosion problem); B", used only 
for colluvial soils occurring at the bottom of slopes (very 
little erosion problem); B, ridges or gently sloping, 3 
percent to 5 percent, (erosion problem); C, sloping, 6 per- 
cent to 10 percent (erosion problem); D, steeply sloping, 
over 10 percent, (erosion problem).

This discussion of soil management is applicable to all soils 
in the Quitman County area. It deals with general principles 
which are fundamental for efficient soil use regardless of the 
type of soil. Specific recommendations for each soil type are given 
in "Management by Soil Type" (page 19). Table 1 contains esti' 
mates of corn and cotton yields that may be expected on each 
soil type where good management practices are used continuously. 
Many of these yields will be exceeded where good management 
practices are used for a number of years. 

Drainage: A system of surface drainage is essential to the 
proper utilization of the majority of Quitman County soils. Before 
an extensive system of ditches are dug on any area, the productive 
capacity, crop adaptation and fertilizer needs of the soil should be 
considered. It is not economical to drain land when the cost of the 
ditching exceeds the value of the land. 

By using the soil map a system of natural surface drainage can 
be laid out for each farm provided the main or primary drainage 
has been provided. All ditches should be located in the natural low 
depression, and the width and depth of the ditch should be govern- 
ed by the size of the area which it drains and the soil types occur- 
ring within the water shed area. Surface run-off from sandy soils 
is much less than on heavier soils, therefore small V'shape ditches 
provide excellent surface drainage. 

The cutting of ditches across ridges should be avoided except 
where it is absolutely essential to drain isolated depressions. The 
omission of these cross ditches makes possible longer rows which 
are essential to mechanized farming.

^These 


yields are estimated for soils on A 


slopes 


that are protected from 


river 



overflow by a levee. Soils not protected by a levee will produce higher yields except 
when damaged by flood. As a rule, soils on B slopes produce slightly lower yields than 
those indicated in this table. See page 19 for management recommendations. 

^Crops are often damaged by standing water. Where good surface drainage is poss- 
ible, yields are about the same as for Panther silty clay.

Soils which have 4, 5, or 6 as the middle number (numbers 
indicate well, excellent, and excessive internal drainage) in their 
symbol generally require shallow V-shaped ditches in the asso- 
ciated depressions. Soils which have 1, 2, or 3 as the middle number 
(numbers indicate very poor, poor, and fair internal drainage) in 
the symbol generally require deeper ditches to provide adequate 
surface drainage. The spoil from all ditches should be spread back 
so that cultivation is not hindered.

MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION 



No. 447 



In the eastern and southeastern part of the county where the 
soil number is preceded by the letter T, main or primary drain- 
age is insufficient for the most efficient land use. After a system 
of primary drainage is established in this area, the local or second- 
ary drainage can be handled as mentioned above. 

Field Layouts and Row Direction 

Where practicable, field boundaries should be placed on soil 
boundaries, then each field will contain only the soils that respond 
to the same management. Rotations, fertilizer treatments, and other 
management practices that are suitable for the entire field can 
then be planned. 

As mentioned before, solid lines indicate an abrupt or sharp 
change between two soil types and, generally, field boundaries 
should be located along the solid line soil iDoundaries. 

Dotted lines indicate a gradual change between two soil types 
and should not always be used as field boundaries. The only time 
a dotted line soil boundary should be used as a field boundary is 
when the two soil types separated by the dotted line soil boundary 
require a different type of soil management. 

Where possible roads should serve as field boundaries and 
should be located on soil boundaries. Roads that cross soil bound- 
aries and field boundaries rather than follow them tend to divide 
the fields in smaller units which are unsuited to mechanized farm^- 
ing. The boundaries of soils with C or D slopes as well as escarp- 
ments and bayou banks are ideal locations for roads. 

Row direction in any field should be governed by the following 
factors: soil type, slope of the land, and the method of tillage. Rows 
on depressional soil (no letter following the soil number) should be 
run with or parallel to the ditch, generally found in the lowest 
part of the depression. Rows on soils with A° slope should run so as 
to provide the best possible run-off. On soil types where the middle 
soil type number is 1, 2, or 3 and the slope is A, each row should 
run so that it has slope enough to carry the water that falls on it 
to a ditch or outlet. On soil types where the middle soil type num- 
ber is 4, 5, or 6, rows should be run on the contour (with the slope, 
not up and down) so that each row will hold the water that falls 
on it. The soils just mentioned have a si^b-soil which allows water 
to move readily down through the soil. Water should not be allowed 
to run off these soils to more poorly drained soils. Rows on all 
B", B, C, and D slopes should be run on the contour in order to pre- 
vent harmful erosion and to conserve moisture. 

Where mechanized methods of tillage are to be used, long rows 
are more efficient. By following the above suggestions on field 
layouts and row dircetion, longer rows and larger units can be had. 



JULY, 1947 SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR QUITMAN COUNTY 15 

FERTILIZATION 
Nitrogen and Organic Matter 

Nitrogen has long been recognized as the main fertihzer 
element lacking in all Delta soils. Additions of nitrogen and organic 
matter to the soil increase the productivity for non-legume crops. 
Properly inoculated legume crops in the rotation provide the cheap- 
est and best source of both nitrogen and organic matter. Bur 
clover and vetch are well adapted winter legumes for soil which 
have 5, 6, or 7 as the last number of their symbols. Vetch or 
winter peas are both adapted for growth on soils which have their 
last number as 2, 3, or 4. Where it is not practical to grow legum- 
inous crops, commercial nitrogenous fertilizers must be used on 
all non-legume crops if maximum yields are to be obtained. Where 
a heavy leguminous crop has been turned under, additions of 
commercial nitrogenous fertilizer may cause excessive stalk growth 
on cotton and corn and lower yields may result. Depressional and 
first bottom soils which are overflowed every three or four years 
maintain a relatively high nitrogen level and do not require 
additions from commercial sources. In fields where small depress- 
ions are numerous more efficient use of nitroger.ous fertilizer 
can be had by leaving the fertilizer off the rows that occur in the 
depression and use it to increase the amount applied to the ridges. 

Recent experimentation with anhydrous ammonia shows that 
fertilization by this source has great promise, especially where 
mechanization is contemplated. Until further studies have been 
made definite information cannot be supplied. 

Phosphorus and Potassium 

Experimental work with phosphorus and potassium carrying 
fertilizer on "delta" soils has been somewhat limited, and it is 
impossible to make specific recommendations for their use. How- 
ever, in Quitman County some phosphorus and potassium carrying 
fertilizers have been used and observations indicate that on cer- 
tain soil types applications of phosphorus and potassium might be 
profitable. Laboratory tests indicate the approximate content of 
available phosphorus and potassium in a soil, but field tests are 
necessary before specific recommendations can be made. 

Phosphorus deficiency is most likely to occur more on soils of the 
low terrace group formed from mixed Mississippi River and Cold- 
water River alluvium and from Little Tallahatchie and Yocona 
River alluvium, (Figure 1). The symbol numbers of these soils be- 
gin with 8 and T8. Observations have indicated that the Forestdale 
series, soil numbers 424 and 425, respond to applications of phos- 
phorus. Soil acidity should be corrected by liming before phos- 
phatic fertilizers are used. 

Potassium deficiency is most likely to occur in sandy soils, es- 
pecially in the group having their soil number begin with 8 and 



16 



MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMNT STATION 



No. 447 



T8. Soils that are deficient in potassium produce weak plants with 
slender stalks and stems. Rust or blight spots in cotton fields ofter' 
indicate a deficiency of potassium in the soils. 

Some soils have no obvious limiting physical characteristics 
such as poor drainage or steep slopes, yet do not produce average 
yields for that type when recommended practices are followed. 
In such cases, farmers may determine the cause of the low yields 
by fertilizing a small area of about six rows with several different 
fertilizers. These tests are most likely to be needed on low terrace 
soils (400, 800, and T800 groups) that are not organic phases. Yields 
from the fertilized plots should be carefully weighed, then com- 
pared with some adjoining plots of the same size that received 
no fertilizer. The County Agent should assist in selecting the fer- 
tilizers and arranging plots.

PASTURE AND FORAGE CROPS 

Experimental work with pastures on Quitman County soil types 
is very limited, however, the practices in pasture follow those 
found essential and efficient in other sections of the state. The soils 
that are best adapted to cotton and corn are generally the best 
adapted soils for pasture. The acreage of first class land on many 
farms is limited, so less productive soils are commonly used for 
pastures. Good management is essential for efficient use of any 
soil type for pasture. 

A firm seedbed is essential to the establishment of a good 
pasture. It is recommended in Mississippi Experiment Station 
Bulletin 356 that "in cases where soil preparation is made, it should 
be done far enough in advance of planting for the seedbed to be- 
come firm. Where time is not allowed for firming, areas should 
be disked, harrowed, seeded, and cultipacked" (7). 



JULY, 1947 SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR QUITMAN COUNTY 



17 



Soils that have symbols ending in number 1, 2, or 3 may make 
good pasture with good management, and soils that have symbols 
ending in 5, 6, or 7 usually make excellent pastures under proper 
management. Soils that have 6 as the middle number are excessively 
sandy and require special management; see ''Management by 
Soil Type," page 19. Acid soils should be limed before being seed- 
ed. Where clovers are to be grown the soil needs plenty of lime, 
phosphate and potash. Soil testing information available indicates 
that soils having their symbols beginning with 8 and T8 may 
require application of lime, phosphate and potash before clovers 
can be grown effectively. For season grazing and pasturing recom- 
mendations see Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station Ser- 
vice Sheet No. 402 and Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion Information Sheet No. 323. 

FORESTRY 

Approximately 30 percent of Quitman County^ is growing 
some kind of timber at the present time. The total amount of forest 
land according to the Department of Forestry, State College, Miss- 
issippi, is 85,800 acres. Much of this forest land is subject to fre" 
quent overflows and is suited only for forest production. 

Four fairly distinct types of bottom land hardwoods are found 
in Quitman County. They are as follows: 

1. Swamp type. This type is made up primarily of cypress and 
tupelo gum. The land occupied by this forest type usually re- 
mains under water the year around. Soils numbered 213, 613, 
and T613 generally support this forest type. 

2. Slough type, known as the Overcup Oak-Bitter Pecan type. 
This type is usually found on the lower elevations of the com- 
plexes numbered 322'A(A-) and 322 A°(A-), 722 A(A-), 722 A«(A-), 
and T824 A(A"), and on the depressional soils where water re- 
mains standing most of the year. Other species associated with 
this type include soft elm, maple, green ash, hackberry, per- 
simmon, sweet gum, and willow oak. 

3. Cherry bark and cow oak-hickory type. This is a very mixed and 
variable type, but is usually identified by having one or all of 
the above species together with other species such as post oak, 
black gum and winged elm. The higher elevation of the soil com- 
plex numbers, 424 A(A-), 824 A(A-), and T824 A(A:), support this 
type. 

4. Water oak-gum type. This type is always characterized by 
either the gum or the oaks in varying portions. The higher ele" 
vation of the soil complexes number 322 A(A-), 322 A°(A-), 
722 A(A-), and 722 A°(A-) support this type.

In Quitman County there are large wooded areas (shown as 
wooded soil complexes on the soil map) where primary drainage 
is inadequate. Where this is the case the potential agricultural 
value of the land can be determined by examining the soil map and 
determining whether or not the predominating soil types found in 
this area are desirable. If the soil types occurring in this area will 
not justify the expenses of providing drainage, it is recommended 
that this land stay in timber and proper timber management prac- 
tices be applied. 

With the present timber prices being at an all time high, and 
with new developments in the chemurgic field, the prospects for 
future markets and better utilization of forest products is very good. 

Less than 5 percent of the land owners in Quitman Count^^ 
are today managing their timber as a crop. It is hoped that as more 
information on management of bottomland hardwoods is made 
available to the landowners of the county by the Delta Branch Ex- 
periment Station, that farmers will not only recognize timber as a 
crop but will begin to manage it as one. 

Cropping Systems Recommended For Use In Quitman County 

For convenience in determining adapted cropping systems for 
the soils in Quitman County, the soil types are grouped into five 
management classes on the basis of fertility, drainage, adapted 
crops, and workability^ The class of each soil type is listed in table 
1 on page 12. 

The cropping systems for all classes are listed in table 3, page 
19. A complete discussion of the management for each soil type 
is given under " Management by Soil Type," beginning on page 19. 

All cropping systems are planned to maintain the most effi- 
cient production of adapted crops on a permanent basis. Cotton is 
considered the principal cash crop and is given the most favorable 
position in rotations for soils where it is adapted. Supplemental 
rotations are also given for each class in which grain or hay pro- 
duction, or both, are given consideration.

MANAGEMENT BY SOIL TYPE 

This discussion covers drainage, crop adaptation, rotation, and 
fertilizer recommendations for each soil type. Fertilizer recom-

mendations are omitted where no experimental work or apparent 
deficiency symptoms indicate a need for commercial fertilizers. 
Rotations and management recommendations are based on experi- 
ment station results, practices followed by the best farmers and 
practices that should prove satisfactory under Quitman County 
conditions. Where there is a possibility that a crop practice may 
not be adapted, a notation advises that it be tried on a small scale 
at first. Cotton is assumed to be the principal cash crop on most 
all farms. The principles discussed under "General Soil Manage- 
ment, (page 11), must be followed if best yields are to be ob- 
tained from any soil. 

MISSISSIPPI RIVER ALLUVIUM 

A. DEPRESSIONAL SOILS. GROUP 200 (derived from Miss^ 
issipp River alluvium). 

Soil Type 212. Dowling clay. 

This is a very poorly drained fertile clay soil that is diffi- 
cult to manage and is limited in productivity by its fine texture 
(clay) and its low position. Deep ditches must be provided before 
cultivation is possible. 

This soil is adapted to soybeans, sagrain, sorghum, and sudan 
grass. Corn makes fair yields when the season is favorable, but 
may fail completely when moisture conditions are not satisfactory. 
A 100 to 200 pound application of a nitrogenous fertilizer should 
be applied when corn is grown, if soil has been in cultivation 
many years. 

For row crops, this soil should be bedded with three furrows 
early in the fall and left until spring. 

Soil type 213. Dowling silty clay 

This is a very poorly drained soil that remains under water 
most of the year and normally supports cypress or tupelo gun) 
tree growth. Without artificial drainage this soil is of very little 
agricultural value. When drained it responds to the same manage- 
ment as 212, Dowling clay, (see page 20). 

Soil type 223. Panther silty clay 

This is a poorly drained silty clay soil that responds to the same 
management as 212, Dowling clay, (see page 20). It differs from 
212, Dowling clay in that shallow ditches often provide adequate 
drainage. Cotton and corn occasionally make fair yields. 

Soil type 224. Panther silty clay loam 

This is a poorly drained soil with a somewhat coarser texture 
(less clay) on the surface than 223, Panther silty clay. This soil 
responds to the same management as 212, Dowling clay (see page

20), except that shallow ditches often provide adequate drainage. 
Cotton and corn occasionally make fair yields. 

Soil type 225. Panther silt loam 

This is a poorly drained soil with a silt loam surface (not as 
much clay as silty clay loam), consequently it is easier to till. This 
soil responds to the same management as 212, Dowling clay (see 
page 20), except that shallow ditches often provide adequate drain- 
age and it is better adapted, for cultivated crops. Cotton and corn 
often make fair yields. 

Soil type 235. Souva slit loam 

This is a fairly well drained soil with a silt loam surface. 
This soil can ordinarily be used to best advantage when it re- 
ceives treatment similar to that of the bordering soils. Shallow 
ditches are needed to obtain good drainage except when it is on a 
B" slope. It is not necessary to follow rotations on this soil, and ap- 
plication of commercial fertilizers should be light. Rows should 
usually be arranged to run in the same general direction as the 
strips of soil. This permits these areas to be planted and cultivated 
when they have proper moisture content without having to delay 
or disrupt cultivation of the remainder of the field. An arrange- 
ment of rows such as this prevents a concentration of drainage 
water in the depression where it is not needed and helps avoid 
poor crop stands. 

Soil type *235. Souva silt loam (organic phase) 

This is ' a fairly well drained dark colored more fertile soil 
than normal Souva silt loam, and responds to the same treatments. 

Soil type 256. Oakwood loam. 

This is an excellently drained sandy soil that responds to the 
same managem.ent as 235, Souva silt loam and *235, Souva silt loam, 
(organic phase) (see above). 

B. LOW BOTTOM SOILS. GROUP 300 (derived from Miss- 
issippi River alluvium). 

Soil type 322. Sharkey clay 

This is a poorly drained soil limited in productivity by its 
''heaviness," (high clay content). Frequent ditches are necessary 
to provide satisfactory drainage for this soil where it has either 
A or A° slopes. 

Soybeans, oats, cotton, vetch, and Austrian, winter peas are 
adapted crops for this-soil. Corn should not be grown except on "new 
ground" or areas where heavy crops of legumes have been plowed 
under. Alfalfa and sweet clover are adapted where this soil is 
neutral or alkaline. Alfalfa should not be planted on poorly drained 
flat areas unless adequate drainage ditches are provided.

MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION 



No. 44-7 



Experimental work at the Delta Experiment Station (4) indicates 
that 40 to 50 pounds of commercial nitrogen was used profitably 
under cotton on a "buckshot soil" similar to 322, Sharkey clay. 
Where leguminous crops have been turned under commercial nitro- 
gen application should be light. Ten-year average results at the 
Delta Station show that a crop of hairy vetch equals 55.4 pounds of 
commercial nitrogen, and increased cotton more than did 30 pounds 
of nitrogen every year except one (5). 

Recent data (8) show that application of more than 30 pounds 
of nitrogen under oats causes considerable lodging which results 
in lower yields. Oats should be fertilized with 150 to 200 pounds of 
nitrogenous fertilizer unless a leguminous crop has been turned 
under the preceding year.

These rotations are arranged to provide sufficient green 
manure crops to maintain a satisfactory content of organic matter 
and nitrogen in the soil. The presence of organic matter in large 
quantities makes cultivation of this soil easier and will raise the 
productivity level. 

In the second year of rotation No. 1, the vetch stubble and 
straw should be turned under as soon as the vetch seed have been 
harvested, and cowpeas or soybeans should be planted. In the fall, 
the cowpeas or soybeans should be turned under before frost and 
the land bedded. 

In rotations No. 2 and 3 soybeans should be turned under in 
late July or early August and the oats planted in October. In early 
spring, soybeans or lespedeza should be drilled in the oats and 
then turned under in the fall when maximum growth has been 
reached. It may be desirable in some cases to harvest the soybean 
or lespedeza seed with a combine and then plow under the stubble 
and straw. 



JULY, 1947 SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR QUITMAN COUNTY 



23 



Where soil tests (see County Agent) show the soil to be 
neutral or alkaline, alfalfa can be substituted in rotation No. 3 the 
second year. After the oats have been harvested in early summer 
the soil should be turned as deeply as practical with a pan or 
flat bottom breaking plow and fallowed until early fall. Before al- 
falfa is planted the field should have surface drains plowed out 
with a grader plow or single disk section. These drains should be 
used on most A slopes and on all A° slopes and should be placed 
every 20 or 30 feet apart for satisfactory surface drainage. 

After 3 or 4 years when the alfalfa stand has become thin, 
the field should be plowed in August and prepared for winter oats. 
Cotton should be grown for two or three years after alfalfa has 
been turned under, then either rotation No. 1 or No. 3 should be 
used before reseeding to alfalfa. 

Soil type 322 A(A ). Sharkey-Tunica-Panther complex 

This complex of soils contains gently undulating, forested 
ridges and poorly drained depressions. The predominating soils 
are 322, Sharkey clay, with 212, Bowling clay; 213, Bowling silty 
clay; and 223, Panther silty clay. Small areas of 424, Forestdale 
silty clay loam and 333, Tunica silty clay are also included. After 
these areas are cleared, corn or cotton can be grown continuously 
until yields start dropping. Then the soils will respond to the same 
management as 322, Sharkey clay (see page 21), and 212 Bowling 
clay (see page 20). 

Soil type 322 A«(A-). Sharkey-Panther complex 

This complex of soils is similar to 322 A(A"), Sharkey-Tunica- 
Panther complex (see above), except that the topography is near- 
ly flat and there is no 333, Tunica silty clay, in the area. Extensive 
drainage systems are usually necessary before these areas can be 
cultivated successfully. Unless sufficient drainage is provided, it 
is recommended that this complex stay in timber. When properly 
drained, these soils will respond to the same management as 322, 
Sharkey clay (see page 21), and 212, Bowling clay (see page 20). 

Soil type 323. Sharkey silty clay 

This is a poorly drained "buckshot" soil, having less clay 
in the surface than 322 Sharkey clay. This soil responds to the same 
management as 322, Sharkey clay (see page 21). 

Soil type 333. Tunica silty clay 

This is a fairly well drained "buckshot" soil that responds to 
the same management as 322, Sharkey clay (see page 21) except 
that little artificial drainage is necessary. Most areas can be ade- 
quately drained by a few small ditches. 



24 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION No. 447 



Soil type 334. Low Bottom escarpment 

The soil type in this escarpment is similar to 322, Sharkey 
clay, except that it occurs on steep slopes and requires no artificial 
drainage. Where possible this soil should be put into a permanent 
pasture. If, however, cultivated crops are grown, rows should be run 
on the contour rather than up and down the slope. 

Soil type 344. Tunica-Dundee complex 

The soil types found in this complex respond to the same 
management as 322, Sharkey clay, except that little artificial 
drainage is necessary. Some of these areas are sandy and suitable 
for corn and truck crop production. In this case management sug- 
gestions made for 424, Forestdale silty clay loam (see page 24) are 
applicable. 

C. LOW TERRACE SOILS, GROUP 400 (derived from Miss- 
issippi River alluvium). 

Soil type 424. Forestdale silty clay loam 

This is a poorly drained soil with a silty clay loam surface 
that is low in fertility. Careful management is necessary to produce 
profitable returns. Frequent small drains leading to fairly deep 
outlet ditches are necessary to provide adequate drainage where 
this soil has an A slope. No artificial drainage is necesary where 
this soil has a B slope. 

Soy beans, oats, cotton, Austrian winter peas and vetch are 
fairly well adapted to this soil. Corn should not be grown excepc 
on "new ground", or areas where large quantities of organic matter 
have been plowed under. 

Cotton and oats should be fertilized with 150 to 200 pounds 
of nitrogenous fertilizer unless a good crop of green manure has 
been turned under, as shown in the suggested cropping systemis as 
in rotation No. 2 in the fourth year.

Alfalfa is not too well adapted to this soil but can be grown. 
Two tons of ground limestone per acre should be applied. Areas 
where water table remains high and where surface drainage is 
poor should not be seeded to alfalfa. If alfalfa is grown, a c.rop of 
soybeans should be turned under in July or early August and the soil 
fallowed until September when alfalfa is planted. 
Soil type 424 ACA ). Forestdale-Dundee-Sharkey-Panther complex 

This complex of soils contains gently undulating, forested 
ridges and poorly drained depressions. The predominating soil types 
are 424, Forestdale silty clay loam; 434, Dundee silty clay loam; 
435, Dundee silt loam; 322, Sharkey clay; and 223, Panther silty 
clay. After these areas have been cleared, these soils can be recog- 
nized and managed according to recommendations mentioned for 
these soil types, (see ^'Management by Soil Type," pages 19 to 26). 
Soil type 425. Forestdale silt loam 

This is a poorly drained soil with a silt loam surface. This soil 
works easily and is responsive to good management. Small drains 
leading to shallow outlet ditches should be used to drain this soil 
where it has an A slope. 

All local crops are fairly well adapted to this soil after adequate 
surface drainage is provided. This is an acid soil and lime should be 
applied before legumes are grown. If alfalfa or sweet clover is 
grown, 2 tons of lime per acre should be applied. One ton of lime 
per acre should be applied where soybeans and winter cover crops 
are grown. Cotton and corn on this soil may give profitable response 
to applications of a complete fertilizer. A small area should be 
selected (see County Agent) for experimental work in order that 
effects from various fertilizer treatments can be determined. Cotton 
and corn should be fertilized with 200 pounds of a nitrogenous 
fertilizer unless a good legume crop has been plowed under, as 
shown in the suggested cropping systems as in rotation No. 2. in 
the fourth year.

No. 447 



In rotation No. 1, seed may be harvested from the soybeans be- 
fore the straw and stubble are plowed under. However, best re- 
sults will be obtained from the succeeding crops if the soybeans 
are plowed under while green. Following winter cover crops, 
corn should not be planted until the cover crop has matured enough 
seed to reseed itself the following fall, or in the case of bur clover, 
it may be desirable to harvest a seed crop. Winter cover crops 
should be planted on this soil when possible. If winter cover crops 
are grown the land should be disked thoroughly and bedded at 
least two weeks before cotton is planted. Where winter cover 
crops are not grown, this soil should be flat broken and bedded, 
or disked and bedded in late fall or early winter. 

Good bur clover stands may be difficult to establish on this soil. 
Application of borax (15 pounds per acre) may correct this situation. 
Yellowing of the leaves and eventual dying of the plants may be 
indications of boron deficiency. 

Soil type 434. Dundee silty clay loam 

This is a fairly well drained soil with a silty clay loam surface. 
This soil responds to the same management as 424, Forestdale silty 
clay loam (see page 24), except that less artificial drainage is 
necessary. 

Soil type 435. Dundee silt loam^ 

This is a fairly well drained soil with an easily tilled silt loam 
surface. This soil responds to the same management as 425, Forest- 
dale silt loam, (see page 25), except that less artificial drainage 
is necessary. The organic phase of this soil, *435, is slightly more 
productive than the regular 435, Dundee silt loam and responds to 
the same management as 436, Dundee loam (see page 26). 

Soil type 436. Dundee loam 

This is a fairly well drained sandy fertile soil that is esaily man- 
aged. A few small V-type ditches provide adequate surface drainage. 

This soil is well adapted to all local crops but is generally 
used for cotton and corn production. High yields of cotton and corn 
can be maintained if leguminous winter cover crops are grown or 
sufficient commercial fertilizer is added. Bur clover and vetch are 
excellent winter crops for this soil. From 150 to 200 pounds of a 
nitrogenous fertilizer should be applied to cotton and corn if a 
leguminous cover crop is not grown, as shown in the suggested 
cropping systems and in rotation No. 2 in the fourth year. Recent 
observations have indicated that in some cases it has been profit- 
able in corn production to double the stand and double the amount 
of nitrogenous fertilizer.

This soil is very well adapted for corn production, therefore 
rotation No. 2 is highly recommended. 

A substitute rotation for No. 2 rotation is to plant cotton the 
first year with bur clover planted in the fall. Harvest bur clover 
seed the second year and plant corn behind the bur clover in June. 
Then follow with two years of cotton. 

Before alfalfa is seeded one ton of ground limestone per acre 
should be applied. Alfalfa should not be planted where a thick stand 
of bur clover is likely to volunteer. Rotation No. 1 or No. 2 should 
follow rotation No. 3. If alfalfa begins to turn yellow, applications of 
boron may prove profitable. 

Soil type 445. Dubbs silt loam^ 

This is a moderately well drained moderately fertile soil 
with an easily tilled silt loam surface. This soil is adapted to all 
local crops and responds to the same management as 435, Dundee 
silt loam. On some areas where the best management has not been 
practiced and fertility is low, rotations suggested for soil type 
425, Forestdale silt loam (see page 25) should be used. Two tons of 
ground limestone should be applied per acre where alfalfa is to 
be grown. If soybeans and vdnter cover crops do not grow well, 
one ton of lime should be applied per acre. 

Soil type 446. Dubbs loam^ 

This is moderately well drained fertile soil with an easily 
tilled sandy surface. It is adapted to all crops and responds 
to the same management as 436 A, Dundee loam. A ton of ground 
limestone per acre should be applied for alfalfa unless the soil is 
an organic phase.

Some areas make excellent bur clover seed patches. This soil on 
a C slope often produces good yields of all crops and is excellent 
for pasture. 

Soil type 456. Bosket loam' 

This is a well drained fertile sandy soil easily managed that 
responds to the same management as 436, Dundee loam (see page 
26). No artificial drainage is necessary. This is one of the most pro- 
ductive soils in the county. 

Soil type 457. Bosket sandy loam^ 

This is a well drained fertile soil somewhat sandier than 456, 
Bosket loam that responds to the same management as 436, Dundee 
loam, (see page 26). No artificial drainage is necessary. 

Soil type 467. Clack sandy loam 

This is an excessively drained somewhat droughty sandy soil 
that requires no artificial drainage. This soil is difficult to man- 
age because of its "droughty" nature. Where cotton and corn are 
grown, yields are very uncertain. The soil, where practical, should 
be planted to some early maturing crops such as sweet corn. 
Drouth resistant hay or pasture crops can be grown with profitable 
results. Sudan grass can be grown for early pasture. Soybeans 
may make fair yields of seed during favorable seasons. Black 
locust seedlings for fence post production should be grown on a 
small trial area. A 1000-pound application of limestone every five 
years may increase growth of legumes. 

Soil type 468. Clack loamy sand 

This is an excessively drained extremely "draughty" sandy soil 
and no row crops should be grown. It is unsuitable for anything 
but early pasture, hay and timber growth.

Corn, soybeans, and sorghum make good growth without fertilizer 
so long as overflows are frequent enough to maintain soil fertility. 
Where this soil is protected by a levee, it will respond to the same 
management as soil type 424, Forestdale silty clay loam (see page

Soil type 534 A(A ). Coldwater Commerce Panther complex 

This complex of soils contains undulating forested ridges 
occurring along the banks of Coldwater River and are subject 
to frequent overflow. The predominating soil types in this complex 
are 534, Coldwater Commerce silty clay loam; 535, Coldwater 
Commerce silt loam; and 623 Coldwater Panther silty clay. Where 
these areas are cleared and protected from overflow, the soils res- 
pond to the same type of management as specified for soils 534 and 
535, (see page 28 and 29). 

Soil type 535. Coldwater Commerce silt loam 

This is a fairly well drained moderately fertile soil with an 
easily tilled silt loam surface. Many areas of this soil overflow- 
frequently, and should be used only for corn, soybeans, and sor- 
ghums. Artiticial drainage of this soil is seldom necessary. 

Where protected from overflow, this soil is well adapted for 
the growing of all local crops. It is an excellent soil for truck crops, 
cotton and corn production. It will respond to the same manage- 
ment as 436, Dundee loam (see page 26), except that phosphorus and 
potassium fertilizers may be needed to maintain maximum produc- 
tion permanently and little artificial drainage is necessary.

(nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) may give profitable re- 
sults when applied to corn or cotton. Experimental areas should

Tallahatchie and Yocona River alluvium) 

A better system of main or primary drainage is necessary be- 
fore most of the soils formed from Little Tallahatchie and Yocona 
River alluvium can be utilized for cultivated crops. Under the 
present system of main drainage the best management practices 
cannot be followed. Approximately 30 percent of these soils are 
in timber. Where practical the lower areas should be left in timber 
and good timber management practices put into effect (see page 17). 

Where these soils have been put into cultivation and adequate 
drainage provided general management practices (see page 11) 
apply.

All of these soils (denoted by the letter T before the soil type 
number) are strongly acid and should have applications of lime be- 
fore legumes are grown (see County Agent). The limited amount of 
experimental data on these soils indicate that applications of a com- 
plete fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) may be 
profitable under cotton and corn. 

The following recommendations are made on the basis that 
adequate main drainage has been provided. 

Soil type T524. Tallahatchie Mhoon silty clay loam 

This is a poorly drained "fresh" soil with a silty clay loam sur- 
face, and it responds to the same management as 424, Forestdale 
silty clay loam (see page 24), except that more artificial drainage 
is necessary and a complete fertilizer may be needed. 

Soil type T525. Tallahatchie Mhoon silt loam 

This is a poorly drained "fresh'' soil with an easily tilled silt 
loam surface, and it responds to the same management as 425, 
Forestdale silt loam (see page 25), except that more artificial 
drainage is necessary and a complete fertilizer may be needed. 

Soil type T534. Tallahatchie Commerce silty clay loam 

This is a fairly well drained "fresh" soil with a silty clay 
loam surface and it responds to the same management as 424, 
Forestdale silty clay loam (see page 24).

This complex of soils contains gently undulating forested areas. 
The predominating soil types are T534, Tallahatchie Commerce silty 
clay loam; T524, Tallahatchie Mhoon silty clay loam; and T623, 
Tallahatchie Panther silty clay loam. When cleared and protected 
from overflow, the soils respond to the same management as men- 
tioned in "Management by Soil Type" (see pages 19 to 26). 

Soil type T535. Tallahatchie Commerce silt loam 

This is a fairly well drained moderately productive soil with an 
easily tilled silt loam surface.. Small V-type ditches in low places 
provide adequate surface drainage. This soil is excellent for truck 
crops, cotton, corn, and pasture. It will respond to the same manage - 
ment as 436, Dundee loam, (see page 26), except that a complete 
fertilizer may be needed. Alfalfa is not recommended for this soil 
In rotation No. 3 oats and soybeans should be substituted for alfalfa.

AMMONIA 

AS A SOURCE OF NITROGEN 




Applying anhydrous ammonia before planting cotton. 



MISSISSIPPI STATE COLLEGE 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION 

RUSSELL COLEMAN, Acting Director 
STATE COLLEGE MISSISSIPPI 



Anhydrous ammonia is the cheapest 
source of nitrogen available. It may be 
handled in the tanks used for propane, 
used in flame cultivation. 

The pressure which anhydrous am- 
monia exerts varies with the temperature 
and may reach 250 pounds per square 
inch on hot summer days. This high 
pressure is not dangerous provided the 
equipment contains the necessary safely 
devices. 

Anhydrous ammonia may be diluted 
with water to form a 30 percent am- 
monia solution which, exerts little or no 
pressure except with high summer tem- 
peratures, and then only a low pressure 
is obtained. Anhydrous ammonia and 
solutions of ammonia have equal value 
for crop production. 

In experimental work anhydrous am- 
monia and solutions of ammonia (aqua 
ammonia) have been found to have crop- 
producing value equal to or superior to 
ammonium nitrate for row crops. Where 
the application of nitrogen at depths of 4 
to 6 inches is superior to shallovvcr ap- 
plications, ammonia may be applied at 
these depths more easily than can solid 
sources of nitrogen. 

For small grains ammonia is a good 
source of nitrogen; however, there are 
problems connected with its application 
in the spring to fall-planted small grain 
which may limit its use. 

Ammonia will kill germinating seed 
if it comes in contact with them. In 
two known cases farmers have applied 
ammonia in the zone where the seed 
were later placed and poor stands of cot- 
ton resulted. However, where ammonia 
has been placed 4 to 6 inches below the 



planting depth of the seed no injuries 
to the germinating seed have been ob- 
tained. 

The data on crop response to am- 
monia and information on the equip- 
ment for applying it were made avail- 
able on March 7. At that time no equip- 
ment was available for applying it. At 
the present time there are more than 
200 machines for applying ammonia, 
most of which are in Mississippi. It is 
anticipated that ammonia will be ap- 
plied to more than 100,000 acres this year. 

With the equipment which is now in 
use for applying anhydrous ammonia 
and solid sources of nitrogen, farmers 
can apply anhydrous ammonia with one 
man and a tractor to about twice as many 
acres as can be fertilized by two men and 
a tractor with solids. The acreage cov- 
ered per day with anhydrous ammonia 
is 35 to 60 acres. 

Both anhydrous ammonia and aqua 
ammonia are suited for pre-planting or 
side-dressing applications. Anhydrous am- 
monia has been applied in the following 
operations by farmers in the Mississippi 
Delta: 

(1) Before planting on level land. (2) 
Before planting on bedded land. (3) Be- 
fore planting and bedding simultaneous- 
ly with listers. (4) As a side dressing. 

In side dressing with ammonia it is 
recommended (without data) that it be 
applied not more than six inches from 
the plants. Where ammonia is applied 
in the water furrow in side dressing it is 
recommended that it be plowed out to- 
ward the plants after it has been in the 
soil for one week. 



Ammonia as a Source of Nitrogen 

A Progress Report on Crop Response to Anhydrous Ammonia and 
Aqua Ammonia, and on Equipment and Methods of Application 

By W. B. ANDREWS, F. E. EDWARDS, and J. G. HAMMONS^ 2 



Until about 100 years ago farmers de- 
pended upon animal manure, green man- 
ure crops, and crop rotations to supply 
nitrogen to crops. During the last cen- 
tury nitrogen has been obtained in com- 
mercial forms: first from Chile, next as a 
by-product from the coking industry, and 
more recently from the air by synthetic 
nitrogen fixing plants. 

This nitrogen obtained from the air is 
treated with hydrogen under high pres- 
sure and in the presence of iron rust to

al Engineer attached to the Agronomy Depart-

form ammonia which contains 82 percent 
nitrogen. 

Ammonia is then used in the manufac- 
ture of several common types of solid 
nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium ni- 
trate, nitrate of soda, and urea. The 
cost of the manufacturing processes 
which are required to change ammonia 
into a solid nitrogen fertilizer acounts 
for about half of the total cost of the 
product. 

Since the application of ammonia di- 
rectly to the soil offered possibilities of 
obtaining nitrogen fertilizer at a great 
reduction in cost, work was started by 
the Mississippi Agricultural Experiment 
Station in 1943 to determine crop re- 
sponse to ammonia as a source of nitro- 
gen.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 448 



The research program, supported joint- 
ly by the Mississippi Station and the 
Tennessee Valley Authority, included the 
development of suitable equipment for 
applying ammonia to the soil, of labora- 
tory studies on the behavior of ammonia 
in the soil, and of measuring the effic- 
iency of the ammonia in terms of crop 
yields- 

As a result of experiments conducted 
during the past four years it has been 
determined that ammonia is a good ni- 
trogen fertilizer, if it is applied properly. 

Properties of Anhydrous Ammonia 

At atmospheric pressure and normal 
temperatures ammonia is a gas. It exists 
as a liquid below — 28° F., and boils at this 
temperature. At 50° F. it has a pressure 
of 75 pounds per square inch. At 100° 
F. it has a pressure of 197 pounds per 
square inch. The pressure is about the 
same as that for commercial propane, 
which is used for flame cultivation, and 
anhydrous ammonia may therefore be 
handled in propane equipment. Butane 
equipment, which is unsatisfactory for 
propane, is also unsatisfactory for an- 
hydrous ammonia. The precautions need- 
ed with propane are necessary with an- 
hydrous ammonia, except there is little 
danger from ammonia catching on fire. 
There should be no chemical reaction be- 
tween ammonia, and any left-over butane 
or propane. Preferably, tanks should be 
left open a few days and blown before 
changing from one to the other. 

Properties of Aqua Ammonia 

Anhydrous ammonia may be diluted 
with water to give a 30 percent ammonia 
solution. This solution has no pressure 
except at high temperatures. Ammonia 
diluted with water, and anhydrous am- 
monia, have equal value for crop produc- 
tion. 

Cost of Nitrogen in Various 
Forms 

Ammonia is the cheapest form of ni- 
trogen available. At the present time, the 



retail cost of nitrogen from different 
sources is approximately: 

Cost per pound 



Source of nitrogen of nitrogen 

Anhydrous ammonia 6 cents 

Ammonium nitrate 10 cents 

Cyanamid 13 cents 

Nitrate of soda 16 cents 



There are patents on the use of anhy- 
drous ammonia, and on equipment for 
applying it. 

Crop Response to Ammonia 
and Ammonium Nitrate 

When properly applied as a fertilizer, 
ammonia goes into solution in the soil 
water, from which it combines with the 
clay. While ammonia is on the clay it 
does not leach out of the soil; however, 
it comes off of the clay particles suf- 
ficiendy rapid to supply crops with ni- 
trogen. 

Young corn and cotton plants prefer am- 
monia to nitrate nitrogen, and they grow 
off more rapidly when ammonia nitrogen 
is applied before planting than when ni- 
trate nitrogen is applied before planting. 
Older plants prefer nitrate nitrogen. When 
only nitrogen is considered, preplanting 
application of ammonia to supply young 
plants with ammonia, which later is 
changed to nitrate for the older plants, 
is ideal. ^ 

If ammonia is to be used to give young 
plants a quick start, it is necessary that 
it be applied immediately before planting 
or while the plants are small. If ammonia 
is to be applied in the spring several v.ceks 
in advance of planting, it will be changed 
over to nitrates on fertile soils before the 
plants can use it as ammcni.i. 

When crops are exposed to the fumes 
of ammonia from either anhydrous am 
monia or aqua ammonia the leaves are 
killed; however, the buds are usually not 
affected and growth continues. Young 
cotton plants are killed out right by the 
fumes of ammonia. In side dressing 
with ammonia, it should be applied and

are not exposed to the fumes. 

It is desirable that ammonia be ap 
pHed where it is to stay; however, oc 
casionally farmers may find it desirable 
to plow it up for some reason. Aftei 
ammonia has been in the soil for about 
four days it should be fixed so that no 
loss of nitrogen occurs on plowing it up 
If it is applied five or six inches deep ii 
should not be disturbed by shallow cul- 
tivation. 

The Response of Cotton to Anhydrous 
Ammonia and Ammonium Nitrate 

In twelve tests with cotton where am 
monia and ammonium nitrate were ap- 
plied side by side, 62 times, at a depth of 
4 inches before planting, ammonium ni- 
trate increased the yield 305 pounds of 
seed cotton per acre and ammonia in 
creased the yield 386 pounds per acre. 
The odds are more than 19 to 1 that this 
difference was due to the superiority of 
anhydrous ammonia over ammonium ni- 
trate. 



The 6-inch depth of application of am- 
monia increased the yield 424 pounds of 
seed cotton per acre. Data collected at 
Stoneville also indicate that a 6-inch depth 
is superior to a 4-inch depth of applica- 
tion. 

In one other test where the soil was in 
such poor physical condition that the am- 
monia could not be completely sealed at 
the 4-inch depth, ammonia was inferior 
to ammonium nitrate; however, the 6-inch 
depth of application of ammonia was su- 
perior to ammonium nitrate at the 4-inch 
depth. 

In seven tests with cotton conducted 
in cooperation with the Delta Branch Ex- 
periment Station, the yield of seed cot- 
ton was 2,091 pounds per acre from am- 
monium nitrate and 2,046 pounds per 
acre from anhydrous ammonia. These 
data show that ammonium nitrate pro- 
duced slightly more seed cotton than 
anhydrous ammonia. However, the vari- 
ations in the yield of cotton obtained were 
such as to suggest that there was no

sources of nitrogen in these tests. 

When nitrogen was apphed as a side 
dressing to cotton, the following yields 
were obtanied in the 12 tests which con- 
tained 62 side-by-side comparisons:

These tests were conducted in 1945 and 
1946 when rainfall was ample. 

In 1944 when dry weather prevailed, 
ammonia applied 5 inches deep as a side 
dressing was much superior to surface- 
applied ammonium nitrate in most tests, 
and a large number of tests were con- 
ducted. The difference in favor of am- 
monia in the side dressing experiments 
on the dry year is attributed entirely to 
depth of placement.

The above data on corn were collected

In 1944, when rainfall was very low, 
anhydrous ammonia applied at a depth of 
approximately 5 inches, usually gave much 
greater increases in yield than ammon- 
ium nitrate applied on the surface. The 
ammonia was applied in the root zone 
where it was available to the plants, while

into the root zone. 

On the basis of the data presented, it 
is reasonable to conclude that ammonia 
as a source of nitrogen is at least as good 
as ammonium nitrate. 

Where depth of placement and uni- 
formity of application are factors in crop 
production, ammonia has advantages over

The Response of Oats to Anhydrous 
Ammonia 

Top dressing small grains with am- 
monia presents problems which are not 
present in row crop fertilization. Fall 
planted oats apparently use nitrate and 
ammonia nitrogen equally well in the 
fall. However, in the spring nitrogen 
applied as ammonia must be changed in- 
to nitrate nitrogen before it is used by 
oats. 

The acidity of the soil as measured 
by pH is closely associated with rate of 
nitrification. Nitrification was found to 
be slow in soils with a pH of 5.1 or less, 
and rapid in soils with a pH of 5.5 or 
higher. The data shown in table 6 were 
obtained for fall applied ammonia as 
compared to spring applied ammonia ni- 
trate. In soils of pH 5.1 or lower the 
rate of nitrification was slow and fall 
applied ammonia was retained by the 
soil through the winter, and gave larger 
yields than spring applied ammonium ni- 
trate. In soils with a pH of 5.5 or high- 
er the rate of nitrification was rapid 
and part of the fall applied ammonia 
was changed to nitrate nitrogen and was 
leached out before spring, and lower 
yields were produced from ammonia ap- 
plied in the fall than from spring ap- 
plied ammonium nitrate. 

On one soil with a pH of 4.95 the 
following data on oats were obtained:

The March application of ammonia on

oats to make maximum use of the nitro-

The ammonia was changed to nitrate 
nitrogen rapidly on this soil and March 
application was satisfactory. The fall ap- 
plication of ammonia was unsatisfactory. 

More data are needed on the fertiliza- 
tion of oats with ammonia. However, 
the data presented suggest that ammonia 



Note two anhydrous ammonia transport trucks, 

should be applied to soils with a pH of 
5.1 or less before February, and that on 
soils with a pH greater than 5.1 ammonia 
should be applied after February 1. 

Ammonia was applied in bands of 15 
or 16 inches apart and about 5-inches 
deep in the above tests. Some data are 
available which indicate that a wider 
spacing is satisfactory; however, more 
data are needed. 

Ammonia is superior to ammonia ni- 
trate for fall application to oats planted 
for grain production. In tests planted 
for grain the yields are reported in 
table 7. 

The unused nitrogen from ammonia 
is retained for spring growth to a much 
greater extent than if the nitrogen were 
ammonium nitrate. 

Ammonia was equal to ammonium ni- 
trate on oats planted in the fall for graz- 
ing (table 8). The data show little dif- 
ference between anhydrous ammonia and 
ammonium nitrate for the production of 
forage by fall planted oats. However, 
they do show that high rates of nitrogen

are essential. The data presented above 
on fall applied ammonia and ammonium 
nitrate to oats for grain production show 
that the unused nitrogen from ammonia 
is carried over until spring, when grain 
is produced, better than that from am- 
monium nitrate. It appears that anhy- 
drous ammonia and aqua ammonia are 
ideal sources of nitrogen for fall planted 
small grains which are to be used for 
grazing. These materials may be ap- 
1 plied conveniently to oats before plant- 
ing. 



Equipment for Storing and 
Applying Anhydrous 
Ammonia 

The development of a machine to ap- 
ply anhydrous ammonia was started at 
the Mississippi Agricultural Experiment 
Station in 1944. 

The first eq-uipment used for applying 
anhydrous ammonia was a 1-row mach- 
ine. It consisted of a side-mounted stan- 
dard 100-pound anhydrous ammonia tank, 
atlantic seamless steel high pressure hose

feed line, rotameter (recommended for 
experimental work) and mounting, con- 
trol globe valve, distribution line, and 
applicator shank. This equipment was 
mounted on a tractor equipped with a 
2-row cultivator. 

Later, 2-row and 4-row equipment was 
developed. The tank mounting was 
changed to the rear of the tractor to fa- 
cilitate loading of 150-pound capacity an- 
hydrous ammonia tanks. A report on this 



machine, which was designed for research, 
has been accepted for publication in June 
or July issue of the Journal of the Ameri- 
can Society of Agricultural Engineers. 

The present equipment for applying 
anhydrous ammonia on the farm was de- 
veloped as a result of the experience ob- 
tained with the research machine describ- 
ed above. In changing the research mach- 
ine over to a more practical type farm 
machine, the following changes were

AMMONIA AS A SOURCE OF NITROGEN 



11 



made: (1) the propane flame cultivator 
tank and mounting was used instead of 
the standard 150-pound capacity anhy- 
drous ammonia cylinder, (2) a differen- 
tial pressure regulating valve and gauge, 
or needle valve and gauge, was used to 
replace the rotameter for metering, and 
(3) the number and size of orifices in 
the manifold was changed. 

Setting Up Field Equipment 

Propane storage and tractor tanks, 
which meet Mississippi specifications, are 
satisfactory for the handling of anhydrous 
ammonia. (Table 9). However, it is 
necessary to change the bronze valves and 
fittings used with propane to special iron 
or steel valves and fittings for handling 
anhydrous ammonia. 

All fittings should be built for a work- 
ing pressure of 250 pounds per square 
inch. Storage and tractor tanks should 
have a working pressure of 200 pounds 
per square inch if tested according to the 
Mississippi specifications for propane 
tanks. With a less strenuous test, high- 
er pressure tanks should be used. Specifi- 
cations for over-the-road tanks will be 



made by the Interstate Commerce Com- 
mission. 

The farm storage tanks may be mount- 
ed permanently or they may be mounted 
on trailers or a combination may be used. 
The same type fittings are used on stor- 
age and tractor tanks. At present, the 
most commonly used storage is 1000-gal- 
lon tanks mounted on trailers. The trac- 
tor mounted tank is customarily of 80 
to 110 gallons in capacity.

The fittings for the tanks are as fol- 
lows: 

1. 300-pound gauge. 

2. A % to Yz inch gas outlet valve 
with short pipe extending into the tank 
which should not permit filling to over 
90 percent capacity. This valve may 
also be used for gas escape in filling by 
bleeding. 

3. A % to 1 inch vapor return valve 
for filling with a pump or compressor. 

4. Safety or pop-off valves. Size: Stor- 
age tank lYz inch; tractor tank, % to 
1 inch; setting, 250 pounds per square 
inch. 

5. A % to 1 inch liquid inlet filling 
valve. 

6. Liquid outlet feed valve connected 
to a down pipe equipped with a 1/64 
inch mesh strainer. Size: storage tank ^ 
to 1 inch; tractor Yi to Y^ inch. 

7. A standard glass gauge graduated 
in gallons per hour. 

The glass gauges indicate the amount 
of ammonia in the tanks. Tn the trac- 
tor the gauge is located on the side of 
the tank next to the tractor. It should 
be shielded for the driver's protection 
and should be enclosed in a very heavy 
clear plastic tube with drain holes at the 
bottom. This same type gauge should be 
used on the storage tank and its location 
will depend upon the build of the tanks. 

Metering Equipment 

At the present time a differential pres- 
sure regulating valve or needle valve and 
pressure gauge is used for metering or 
regulating the flow of anhydrous am- 
monia through orifices in the manifold. 
A short nipple connects the tank feed 
line valve to a quarter turn cut-off valve 
which is connected to the regulator valve. 
The manifold connects to the low pres- 
sure side of the regulator valve. The 
regulator valve should be built to with- 
stand 250 pounds pressure per square 
inch on the tank side and 100 pounds per 
square inch on the manifold side. The 
manifold is made of short tees, elbows, 



and anhydrous ammonia flange unions 
into which the orifices are fitted. After 
this metering system was built, it was 
calibrated by the rotameter to give the 
readings in table 13. 

When one applicator is used per row 
the size of the orifices is 3/32 of an inch. 
When the application is made with mid- 
dle busters or listers or other equipment 
where two applicator furrows are made 
per row, the orifices feeding these lines 
should have one-half of the area and not 
one-half of the diameter of 3/32 orifices. 
The diameter of the one-half sized orifice 
is approximately 1/16 inch. 

The feed lines leading from the mani- 
fold to the applicators should be 150- 
pound test 14 -inch rubber air hose. 

Anhydrous ammonia has been applied 
in the following operations in the Mis- 
sissippi Delta: 

1. Before planting on prepared level 
land, in which the applicators are mount- 
ed on cultivator frames and the am- 
monia is sealed with disc hillers. 

2. Before planting on bedded land, in 
which the applicators are mounted on 
cultivator frame and the ammonia is 
sealed by disc hillers. 

3. Before planting while bedding with 
listers, which seal the ammonia. 

4. In the planting operation, in which 
the applicators are mounted on the cul- 
tivator frame. 

5. In side dressing, in which the ap- 
plicators are mounted on cultivator frame 
and the ammonia is sealed with a disc 
hiller or by the cultivator sweeps. 

The number of applicators and size of 
orifices for the different types of opera- 
tions are shown in table 10. 

The applicators should be run to a 
depth of 5 to 6 inches; and the disc hillers, 
where used, should be set at approximate- 
ly half the depth of the applicators so that 
they will completely seal the ammonia, 
[f it is desired to apply ammonia to small 
grain the applicators should be run 5 to 
6 inches deep and spaced 16 inches apart. 



AMMONIA AS A SOURCE OF NITROGEN 



13 



There is some difficulty in sealing the 
material in top dressing oats and re- 
search is being continued on the devel- 
opment of satisfactory sealing methods. 
Construction of Applicators 
During the process of machinery de- 
velopment, several different types of ap- 
plicators were built. The most satisfac- 
tory one was made from a 5^ -inch x 2- 
inch steel bar. The width of the bar 
stock was reduced by cutting out !4-inch 
in the middle of the front and tapering 
the cut out at each end. The bar stock 
was cut at a 30-degree angle at the bot- 
tom. The applicator was curved and 
drawn out to a knife edge at the front, 



and a %-inch x 1-inch suction point was 
drawn out at the bottom. When the ap- 
plicator is curved properly, there should 
be a horizontal distance of SYz inches be- 
tween the point of the applicator and a 
vertical line drawn from the back side 
of the top of the applicator to the level 
of the point. This curve should grad- 
ually blend out at 4^2 inches from the top 
of the applicator. 

The standard is round and about 4^2 
inches long. The fork holder is of two 
pieces of /2-inch x 2-inches x 4 1^ -inches 
bar steel welded to each side of the stan- 
dard separated by a distance of V^-inch 
to take the applicator. The applicator

should be set at a 15-degree angle with 
the fork holder. The overall vertical 
height of the applicator, holder and stan- 
dard should be 19 to 20 inches. The ap- 
plicator is placed in the fork, after which 
suitable holes spaced V/i inches apart are 
drilled. The upper hole is drilled for a 
3/16-inch bolt, while the lower hole is 
drilled for a 1/^-inch bolt. Bolts placed 
in these holes fasten the applicator in the 
fork that is welded to the round standard, 
and the 3/16-inch bolt at the top acts as 
a break pin. 

A %-inch pipe through which the feed 
hose passes is spot-welded at the top and 



bottom to the back of the knife. The 
pipe should not come closer than 3 inches 
to the bottom of the fork and V/i 
inches above the point of the applicator. 

The pipe should be split up %-inch 
from the bottom and cut off, leaving a 
small strip that can be bent down to 
clamp the hose to the applicator. The hose 
is cut at a 30 degree angle at the bottom. 
It should have \ Vi inches clearance when 
the applicator is set in operating position. 
After the hose has been cut and clamped 
at the bottom, the pipe should be flatten- 
ed in order to decrease the wear on it 
and hold the hose in the pipe.

with stationary fill depth pipe in tank. (3) Pop-off valve. (4) Liquid outlet and valve. 
(5) Liquid transfer. 



Filling Operation 

The ways of filling tanks with anhy- 
drous ammonia are as follows: (1) by 
bleeding gas off the tank being filled 
with the liquid line connected between 
tanks, (2) by pumping the liquid with 
the vapor line connected between tanks, 
and (3) by compressing the gas vapor 
from the tank being filled into the stor- 
age tanks with the liquid line connected. 

Bleeding off to fill tanks is carried out 
in the following order: (1) connect the 
vapor hose to the tractor tank, (2) con- 
nect the liquid line between the tanks, 
(3) barely open the vapor valve on tract- 
or tank, (4) open the liquid valve on 
tractor tank, (5) open the liquid valve 
on the hose line next to the tractor tank 
(if not already open; it should be open), 
(6) open the valve on liquid line on the 
storage tank, and (7) continue to open 
the vapor valve on the tractor tank until 
the pressure gauge shows 10 to 20 pounds 



less pressure than is shown by the gauge 
on the storage tank. If a greater pressure 
differential is obtained, one may expect 
a greater loss of ammonia, as shown in 
table 11. 

The recommended difference in gaug? 
reading 10 to 20 pounds will give a 
very low loss of from 1 to 2 percent, yet 
this difference should give a very quick 
filling time. If bleeding is rapid enough 
to accumulate moisture on the tank, and 
particularly for ice to form on the tank, 
the loss of ammonia is excessive. In fact, 
bleeding to atmospheric pressure may 
result in a loss as high as 36 percent of 
the total ammonia. 

When the tank is filled to 90 percent 
of capacity, a white spray will start es- 
caping from the vapor line. When the 
white spray starts, the valve on the liquid 
line on the storage tank should be closed 
at once. Then the vapor line valve on 
the tractor tank followed by the liquid 



16 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPHRIMKNT STATION BULLETIN 448 



hose valve next to the tractor should be 
closed, after which the filling valve on 
the tractor tank is closed. The union 
should then be loosened and the ammonia 
in the short nipple should be drained be- 
fore the connection is completely broken. 
The filling hose should be drained in or- 
der to prevent accidents such as bursting 
of the hose or releasing ammonia on the 
operator while making connections. 

In filling with the pump, the procedure 
should be in the following order: (1) con- 
nect the vapor hose line to the vapor out- 
lets, (2) open valves on vapor line, (3) 
connect the liquid line, (4) open the fill 
valve on the tractor tank, (5) open the 
liquid line valve next to the tractor rank, 
(6) open the liquid line valve 3n the 
storage or field tank, (7) open the depth 



fill gauge valve on tractor tank and (8) 
start the pump. 

As soon as the white spray starts to 
escape from the vapor valve the pump 
should be cut off, and the valves closed 
in the following order: (1) liquid valve 
on storage tank, (2) vapor valve on stor- 
age tank, (3) vapor valve on tractor 
tank, (4) disconnect vapor line connec- 
tion on tractor tank, (5) close depth 
gauge valve on tractor tank, (6) close 
liquid valve on hose line next to tractor 
tank, (7) close fill valve on tractor tank, 
(8) loosen liquid Une connection on tract- 
or tank and let the material in the short 
nipple drain out. The line is then com- 
pletely disconnected and drained. 

In filling with a compressor, the opera- 
tion of valves and connections are the

same as in filling with the pump except 
the compressor is connected into the vapor 
line. 

Operating the Tractor Equipment 

The first step in the operation of the 
field machine is to determine the rate 
of ammonia to be applied per hour. The 
amount of ammonia to be applied is regu- 
lated by the use of a differential pressure 
regulating valve. The rate of delivery 
of ammonia is in relation to time and 
not to the speed of the tractor. Con- 
sequendy, the speed of the tractor must 
be determined. 

To find the speed of the tractor in 
feet per second: first, set the applicators 
and covers at the correct depth to com- 
pletely seal the ammonia (6 inches below 
the seed level is recommended); second, 
make a trial run to get the correct throt- 
de, covers, applicator, and gear setting; 
third, measure off a distance of 300 to 
500 feet and record the time required to 
cover this distance; fourth, divide the 



distance in feet by the time in seconds, 
which gives feet per second. 

After the speed of the tractor in feet 
per second has been determined, the 
pounds of ammonia per hour may be 
obtained from table 12. As an example, 
the table shows that 340 pounds of am- 
monia per hour is required to give 40 
pounds of nitrogen per acre with rows 
42 inches wide and a tractor speed of 
5.88 feet per second. The table is made 
up for 4-row equipment, and the pounds 
of ammonia per hour should be divided 
by two for 2-row equipment. 

The rate of ammonia per hour was 
calculated by the following formula: 
speed of tractor in feet per second x 3,600 
X number of rows x row width in feet 
X pounds of nitrogen per acre divided by 
43,560 times 0.83 as shown below: 
5.88 X 3,600 X 4 X 31/2 X 40 divided by 
43,560 X 0.82 equals 332 pounds of am- 
mcnia per hour. Since the table is set 
up in 20-pound divisions the table shows 
340 instead of 332.

Determing the Setting of the 
Differential Pressure Valve 

The equipment as used by the Missis- 
sippi Experiment Station has a manifold 
with 3/32-inch orifices which distribute 
the ammonia to the individual rows. The 
rate at which ammonia flows through 
orifice depends upon the tank pressure. 
After the rate of ammonia per hour has 
been determined, it is necessary to deter- 
mine the pressure on which the regulat- 
ing valve must be set to give the desired 
pounds of ammonia. 

Table 13 shows the regulating valve 
pressure settings which are necessary to 
supply a given amount of ammonia per 
hour with different tank pressures. As 
an example, where 340 pounds of am- 
monia per hour is desired and the tank 
pressure is 115 pounds per square inch, 
the regulator valve should be set on 49 
pounds pressure per square inch. For 
2-row equipment the reading is obtain- 
ed for twice the desired amount of am- 
monia. If 170 pounds of ammonia were 
required for 2-row equipment, the valve 
setting would be for 340 pounds per hour 
as shown in the table. 



It is recommended that manufacturers 
of equipment obtain a rotameter and cali- 
brate the equipment which they build. 
The size of the orifices and the pressure 
shown by the regulating valve determine 
the rate of flow of ammonia. 

Equipment for Storing and 
Applying Aqua Ammonia 

Aqua ammonia (30 percent ammonia) 
exerts no pressure below 70 degrees Fah- 
renheit. At 110 degrees Fahrenheit a 
pressure of 10 pounds per square inch 
is exerted. In order to avoid the loss 
of ammonia from aqua ammonia it 
should be maintained in a closed system 
at all times. Where tanks have openings 
into the air some ammonia will be lost 
constantly. 

All tanks for handling aqua ammonia 
should have the following fittings: 

1. Filling valve. 

2. Pop-off valve set on 10 pounds pres- 
sure. 

3. Bleeding valve. 

4. Air inlet check valve. 

5. Outlet valve and hose. 

6. Glass indicator gauge. 

All fittings should be made of iron

or steel. Copper or brass fittings are 
not suitable. 

All tanks and fittings should be tested 
for a working pressure of 30 pounds per 
square inch. Where 30 percent aqua 
ammonia is used, normally the highest 
anticipated pressure is 10 pounds per 
square inch, but where tanks are not 
shaded the pressure may go higher in 
the summer and the above tank specifi- 
cations are suggested to cover extremes. 

The material handled in this equip- 
ment normally has no pressure. This 
makes it possible to use a low pres- 
sure metering pump to meter the mater- 
ial to the applicators. The type of pump 
used is a 20 DV Yale-Towne rotary posi- 
tive deplacement pump with variable 
volume manual control that will give a 
maximum 1.5 gallons per hundred revolu- 
tions. 

The pump is driven from the tractor 
axle through a counter shaft which steps 
the speed up to 400 R.P.M. A l!4-inch 
liquid line connects the pump to the 
tractor tank on the suction side of the 
pump. Then, there should be a 5- to 
10-pound pressure relief discharge valve. 
The valve is used to cut off the small 



flow of liquid through the pump when 
the tractor is standing still. Connected 
to the pressure relief valve is the manifold 
built from !4-inch x 2-inch pipe nipple, 
with 3/32-inch orifices installed into !4- 
inch ammonia flange unions. The top of 
the cap of the union is turned out !4-inch 
deeper to take the orifice, and the other 
side is threaded so that the orifice may 
be screwed into it. The ^/4-inch 150-test 
rubber hose connects the manifold to the 
same type of applicator as described 
above, and disc hillers are used for cov- 
ering when the equipment is mounted 
on the tractor with the cultivator. 

The size of orifices would have to 
change for different hook ups as shown 
above. 

When a metering pump has been de- 
veloped to operate under high pressure 
ammonia, and suitable for mounting on 
a tractor, anhydrous ammonia may be ap- 
plied in a manner similar to that de- 
scribed above for aqua ammonia. 

The one great advantage of the meter- 
ing pump is that the rate of distribution 
is timed with ground speed of the tractor. 

A hose pump was developed for the 
application of aqua ammonia by the Ten- 



20 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 448 




nessee Agricultural Experiment Station as 
reported in Circular 87. The pump con- 
sists of heavy walled rubber tubing, size 
!4 to Vi inch, mounted over rollers, 
spaced 2 inches from the shaft which are 
driven by a chain or belt. The revolu- 
tions of the pump vary up to 200 per 
minute. 

The quantity of aqua ammonia de- 
livered per 100 revolutions by hose of 
different size is: 



Inside diameter 


Gallons per 


of tube in inches

1/4 


0.16 


5/16 


0.20 


3/8 


0.31 


1/2 


0.56 



The quantity of ammonia delivered 
is varied by varying (a) the size of the 
sprocket wheels or drive pulleys, (b) the 
number of hoses for the width covered, 
and (c) the size of the hoses. 

Since aqua ammonia should be main- 
tained in a closed system to avoid the 



loss of ammonia, the field tanks should 
have a valve which admits air when 
pressure is lowered as the aqua ammonia 
is pumped out of the tank. It was ad- 
vised in Tennessee Agricultural Experi- 
ment Station Circular 87, that aqua am- 
monia be diluted with water to avoid 
pressure when the temperature is above 
80 degrees Fahrenheit. 

If the increase in pressure above this 
temperature interferes with the operation 
of the pump it is necessary to operate it at 
atmospheric pressure and ammonia will 
escape through the gas outlet in the tank. 
Evidently, information is needed on this 
detail of the pump. 

Several farmers have used the hose 
pump satisfactorily, presumably at -at- 
mospheric pressure. If this pump does 
handle the pressure developed by aqua 
ammonia, it has a very definite advantage 
in that sizes may be made which are 
suitable for one-horse as well as tractor 
equipment.

Preparation of Vegetables in Small Town 
Families of Mississippi 



r 



By DOROTHY DICKINS 



This study reports methods used in 
preparation of 9,246 cooked vegetables 
and vegetable salads by 844 families in 
six small towns of Mississippi. Methods 
used in preparation of vegetables are im- 
portant, since vegetables are an excellent 
source of vitamins and minerals. Vita- 
mins can easily be destroyed by poor 
methods of preparation and storage. Min- 
erals can be lost by draining during 
cooking or after cooking is complete. 

Methods of preparation in use will be 
compared with methods recommended by 
food and/or nutrition specialists. Sug- 
gestions for improving vegetable prepara- 
tion will be given. 

Methods and Scope of Study 

Two methods of securing information 
concerning vegetable preparation were 
used in this study (1) the record method, 
whereby detailed day-by-day records of 
steps in preparation of particular vege- 
tables served during the report week were 
kept by homemakers; (2) the schedule 
method, whereby homemakers were in- 
terviewed with the use of schedules con- 
cerning preparation of vegetables. 

Both record and schedule methods 
were used in securing preparation in- 
formation since somewhat more accurate 
information concerning preparation can 
be obtained by the record method, but 
families willing to keep detailed day-by- 
day preparation records have superior 
practices.^ The schedule method, in ad- 
dition to giving a more representative

aration," Dorothy Dickins, Miss. Agr. Exp. Sta.

Town Families of Mississippi," and "Tradition- 
al Food Preparation Rules," Bulletins 415 and

sample, has the further advantage of be- 
ing less expensive. A large coverage of 
families is important in securing infor- 
mation about preparation of particular 
vegetables, since there are many vege- 
tables used by only a few famihes. 

The information of this study was se- 
cured from three sources: (1) from rec- 
ords kept one week by homemakers in 
80 white and 80 Negro families in Acker- 
man, Eupora, and Marks. The families 
were representative of the main groups 
in which families in the survey study 
from which they were drawn had been 
classified.-^ (2) From schedules filled 
out by personal interview with homemak- 
ers in 145 white and 121 Negro fam- 
ilies in Ackerman, Eupora, Marks, and 
Tunica. The families included consti- 
tuted a random sample of families in the 
survey towns not in the record study. 
(3) From schedules filled out by per- 
sonal interview with homemakers in all 
eligible families (295 white and 123 
Negro) in Calhoun City and Friars 
Point. To be eligible for all of these 
studies, the family must have been a 
housekeeping family with a female home- 
maker and no more than one boarder. 

The two schedule studies were limited 
in the main to preparation of vegetables 
for which no preparation records, or only 
a few preparation records, had been kept 
in the record study. There were a few 
exceptions, since it seemed desirable to 
compare preparation practices when the 
two methods of getting information were 
used. Information concerning prepara- 
tion of new string beans, cabbage, and 
Irish potatoes, as well as preparation of 
string beans, cabbage, and Irish potatoes, 
was asked for, since in the survey men- 
tioned above, a number of homemakers 
reported preparation rules concerning 



4 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



"new" vegetables (the first mess or mes- 
ses), especially new Irish potatoes. In- 
formation secured was limited to vege- 
tables ordinarily served by the family 
when in season. 

Forms used in the record and schedule 
studies are shown in the Appendix. 

Description of Families 

Median size of families in this study 
was three members. It was the same for 
Negro as for white families. Home- 
makers in white families had completed 
a median of 12 grades; in Negro families, 
a median of 6 grades. (By median is 
meant that there v^ere as many families 
with more than three members as with 
less than three members; as many white 
homemakers with less than 12 grades of 
schooling as with more than 12 grades 
of schooling. The median is the mid- 
point.) 

The main occupation of 374 of the 
844 families included was unskilled, semi- 
skilled, and skilled wage work in non- 
agricultural pursuits. In 145 families, 
the main occupation was white collar 
work; in 130 famiHes, professional work 
or operation of independent businesses. 
One hundred and eight families were 
farmers (owners, renters, croppers or 
wage workers). Eighty-seven families 
had no occupation, but were living from 
dependency allotments, pensions, relief 
and/or investments. 

The main occupation of relatively two 
times more Negro than white families 
was wage work and farming. The oc- 
cupation of white famiHes was much 
more often white collar work, profes- 
sional work, and business ownership. 
Only 17 of the 324 Negro families in- 
cluded had these as main occupations. 
About the same proportion of Negro as 
of white families had no occupation — 
11 percent as compared with 9 percent. 

Five hundred and fifty-four of the 844 
families resided in houses with monthly 
rent or rental values of $20.00 or less, 
254 in houses with monthly rent or rent- 



al values of $20.01 to $40.00, and 36 in 
houses of over $40.00. All Negro fam- 
ilies resided in houses with a monthly 
rent or rental value of $20.00 and under. 

Families in the record and schedule 
samples differed in certain respects. The 
main occupation of families in the rec- 
ord sample was somewhat more likely 
to be professional work or business own- 
ership, somewhat less likely to be v/age 
work (table 1 in Appendix). Home- 
makers in the record sample in famiHes 
with rent or rental value the same, were 
younger than those in the schedule sam- 
ple. Record-keeping Negro homemak- 
ers had completed a median of 8 grades 
as compared with 5 grades for non-rec- 
ord keepers. There was no difference in 
the median grade completed by vv^hite 
homemakers in the record and schedule 
samples. 

Who Prepared and Source of 
Methods Used 

Information as to who prepared and 
source of the methods in use were se- 
cured from homemakers in the record 
study. Eighty-nine percent of the vege- 
table dishes for which preparation rec- 
ords were kept were prepared by the 
homemaker. 

Methods used in preparation of 70 per- 
cent of the cooked vegetable dishes were 
reported as those taught by mother. The 
source of the method used in about 10 
percent of the cooked vegetables was 
stated as unknown. In about 5 percent 
it was said to be original. 

In a previous study of this series in 
which 1,158 homemakers had been ques- 
tioned about new vegetable dishes tried 
during the past year and source of recipe, 
friends were the source most often men- 
tioned.-/ However, in the record study, 
homemakers were asked to keep records 
of dishes ordinarily prepared, when the 
food was in season, and most of the pre-

paration records were of boiled ;,triiig 
beans, butter beans, field peas, and Irish 
potatoes or vegetable dishes prepared in 
homes of parents and grandparents of 
these homemakers. The fact that cook- 
ed vegetable dishes for which records 
were kept were traditional dishes would 
account for the large number being re- 
ported as learned from mother. 

Source of the recipes for raw vege- 
table dishes (vegetable salads) most oft- 
en mentioned was original (or made it 
up). Mother was not so often the source 
of information as for cooked vegetables. 

Methods of Preparing 
Vegetables 

Ninety-three percent of the reports with 
which this bulletin is concerned are re- 
ports of cooked vegetable dishes. Seven 
percent are reports of raw vegetable 
dishes. (See table 2 in Appendix). 
Three-fourths of the reports of cooked 
vegetable dishes are reports of cooked 
fresh vegetables. The majority of fam< 
ilies in the six towns included in this 
study produced most of their vegetable 
supply in the summer and some of it in 
winter. The fact that a number of fam- 
ilies produce their vegetables would ac- 
count for the large number of fresh 
vegetable reports secured. 

Cooked Vegetable Dishes 
Fresh Leafy Vegetables 
Preparation reports of 11 different 
leafy vegetables were secured: beet tops, 
cabbage, Swiss chard, collards, kale, leaf 
lettuce, mustard greens, rape, spinach, 
tender greens, and turnip greens. (See 
table 2 in Appendix.) In all, 1,932 re- 
ports were obtained. Only 94 of these 
were from the record study. The rec- 
ord study was made in summer when 
fresh leafy vegetables were not usually 
available in home gardens, or if available, 
were not at their best eating stage. Fifty 
of the 94 records were of cooked cab- 
bage, 23 of cooked turnip greens, and 14 
of cooked collards. 



The majority of leafy vegetables used 
by the families were reported as usually 
home produced. One exception was cab' 
bage. About 50 percent in both the rec- 
ord and schedule groups reported that 
they purchased cabbage. 

The usual procedure followed was to 
wash leafy vegetables several times in 
cold water. However, collard, turnip, 
and mustard greens were rather frequent- 
ly washed in soda water by Negro wom- 
en. About one-third of the Negro wom- 
en interviewed in the schedule study 
reported that they washed collard greens 
in soda water; one-seventh reported they 
washed turnip greens in soda water, and 
one-tenth that they washed mustard 
greens in soda water. 

Homemakers in both schedule studies 
were questioned about practices concern- 
ing use of stems and midribs of greens. 
Seventy-six percent said they discarded 
all stems. Forty-eight percent of the 
homemakers said they stripped the cen- 
ter (removed the midrib) when greens 
were old and tough, and 4 percent that 
they stripped the center always. 

About 10 percent of the leafy vegetables 
were soaked before cooking, usually in 
cool water. This practice was much 
more common in case of collard and cab- 
bage than other greens. Soda was added 
to the soaking water by a few — more oft- 
en by Negro than white women and in 
preparation of collards than in othei 
greens. Nearly 10 percent of the Negro 
homemakers in the schedule study added 
soda to the water when soaking collard 
greens, in only one of the collard pre- 
paration records kept by a Negro wom- 
an, the greens were soaked in soda wa- 
ter before cooking. 

Greens were more often started to cook 
in a kettle with boiling water and partly 
cooked salt pork than by any other meth 
od. About two-thirds reported that col- 
lards, turnip greens, tender greens, and 
kale were thus started; about one-half 
cabbage, mustard and rape; one-third, 



6

beet tops and Swiss chard; and one fifth, 
spinach. 

The typical method of preparing spin- 
ach was to start in a small amount of 
boiling water, cook until tender and 
drain. This was also the method follow- 
ed by the majority reporting preparation 
of beet tops and Swiss chard. Families 
using salt pork in cooking these three 
leafy vegetables as well as in cooking kale, 
rape, and mustard, often mixed and cook- 
ed along with turnip greens. Collards 
and turnip greens were the leafy vege- 
tables most often started in cold water 
with raw salt pork. About 20 percent 
reporting on those two vegetables stated 
that this was the usual method. 

Butter or oleo was used by the most 
families in seasoning spinach and b^ 
the fewest families in seasoning collards 
In fact, no homemaker reported butter 
or oleo as the usual seasoning added to col- 
lard greens. Only two or three reported 
these fats ordinarily used in seasoning 
turnip, mustard, and tender greens. Sah 
pork or bacon grease and lard were used 
by a number of homemakers. Some- 
times these fats were used along with 
?alt pork "to make the pork go further.'" 

About one-half of the women report- 
ed that they tore up or stripped largf 
leaves before cooking. Small leaves were 
generally cooked whole. About one 
third quartered cabbage, and the remain 
der cut it in small pieces before cooking. 

Five or more homemakers reported or- 
dinarily adding soda in cooking of cab- 
bage, collards, kale, mustard, rape, ten- 
der greens, and turnip greens. Seven- 
teen percent reported adding soda dur- 
ing cooking of collarrl greens, 10 percent 
during cooking of turnip greens, and 8 
percent during cooking of cabbage. Only 
3 percent reporting on tender greens said 
they usually added soda during cook- 
ing. The practice of adding soda dur- 
ing cooking was much more common in 
the Negro than in the white household. 
For example, only two of the 36 adding 



soda to collards during cooking were 
white women; only one of the 29 adding 
soda to turnip greens was a white woman. 

Parboiling leafy vegetables, that is, 
cooking a few minutes, then draining, 
adding more water and continuing cook- 
ing, was most common for spinach. 
About 14 percent reported parboiling. 
Cabbage, turnip greens, and mustard 
greens were other vegetables usually par- 
boiled by a few homemakers. Parboil- 
ing was a practice more common in the 
white than in the Negro group. 

In the two schedule studies homemak 
ers were asked whether they cooked vege 
tables with lid off or on, and cabbage 
was the only vegetable mentioned as be 
ing cooked with lid off. 

In both schedule studies homemakers 
were asked if they started vegetables in 
no water, a Httle water, one-half cover 
ed, covered, or more than covered. The 
majority replied in a little water for all 
vegetables about which questioned, ex- 
cept new Irish potatoes, beets, and col 
lards. The first two were most often 
reported as started as covered; collards as 
started one-half covered. The practice 
was to add water during cooking, rather 
than to begin with large amounts. 

Record keeping homemakers also used 
only a little water in starting vegetables. 
Data concerning total amounts used by 
this group were not satisfactory, since 
many forgot to record amounts added 
during cooking. For this reason, these 
data were not summarized. 

A few homemakers added sugar to all 
vegetables which they prepared. A num- 
ber added it in preparation of particular 
vegetables only. From 30 to 40 percent 
added sugar to turnip greens, rape, col- 
lards, mustard greens, and kale (40 per- 
cent to turnip greens and 30 percent to 
kale.) Nineteen percent added sugar in 
preparation of cabbage, 15 percent in 
preparation of chard, and 11 percent in 
preparation of tender greens. Less than 
10 percent used sugar in preparation of 
spinach and beet tops.

Homemakers varied considerably as to 
time of adding salt. About one-third 
added salt at the time of putting the 
vegetable on to cook, a little less than one- 
third added it during the cooking process 
and a little more than one-third at the 
end of the cooking period. The propor- 
tion following the various practices as 
to adding salt was about the same for 
all greens. 

In testing the forms to be used in 
the schedule studies, it was found that 
homemakers seemed to give more accur- 
ate information concerning the usual hour 
of putting vegetables on the stove and 
the usual hour of serving the mea!. 
Therefore, this information was asked for 
in the schedule studies rather than: How 
long do you cook turnip greens, mustard 
greens? Time between cooking and 
serving the meal was worked out for 
each vegetable when editing the schedule- 
Median, minimum and maximum time 
I between putting on to cook and serving 
t reported for the different leafy vegetables 
I by homemakers in the two schedule stu- 
dies is given in table 1. In the interval 
between completing cooking and serving 



most homemakers kept the vegetable on a 
cooler part of the stove, or in the warm- 
ing oven. However, a few dished it up 
and placed it on the dining table. Some 
homemakers arranged cooking time so 
there was no interval between completing 
cooking and serving. In the record stu- 
dies in which a record was kept of time 
from putting on range to completing cook- 
ing and of time between completing 
cooking and serving, in about one-third 
of the records of leafy vegetables there 
was no interval. 

As will be noted in table 1, collards 
turnip greens, kale, mustard, rape, ten- 
der greens, and cabbage were the leafy 
vegetables which had the longest cook- 
ing and standing periods. These were also 
the leafy vegetables most often seasoned 
with salt pork. Median time between 
putting on to cook and serving was less 
for vegetables not seasoned with salt pork 
than for vegetables seasoned with salt 
pork. For example, the median interval 
for spinach when seasoned with salt pork 
was two hours; when not seasoned with 
salt pork, 30 minutes. 

There was wide variation in minimum

and maximum time between putting the 
vegetable on the range to cook and serv- 
ing (table 1). The variation was less 
in case of coUards and turnip greens, the 
two vegetables in which minimum time 
was greatest. 

Most homemakers reported that they 
either had no pot liquor or that the 
liquor they had was consumed by the 
family. Only 10 percent of the leafy 
vegetable records showed pot liquor not 
consumed. Pot liquor from beet tops, 
kale, rape, and spinach was the kind of 
pot hquor most frequently reported not 
eaten; while pot liquor from cabbage, 
turnip greens, and mustard greens was 
the pot liquor least frequently reported 
as not eaten. Pot liquor is the Uquid 
seasoned with fat on the vegetable at the 
time of serving. 

Negro homemakers in the record study 
kept records, with the help of a Negro 
supervisor, of 43 cookings or lots of cab- 
bage cooked. Information concerning 
the usual method of cooking cabbage was 
obtained from 110 Negro homemakers 
in the schedule study. Data are, there- 
fore, available for comparing the prac- 
tices of the record and schedule groups. 

In 10 percent of the preparation rec- 
ords of Negro homemakers, cabbage was 
soaked in cold water before cooking; in 
2 percent it was soaked in cold soda 
water. Twenty-one percent of the Negro 
homemakers in the schedule group re- 
ported that cabbage was soaked before it 
was cooked; 6 percent reported it soaked 
in cold soda water. 

In none of the cabbage preparation 
records of Negro homemakers was the 
cabbage parboiled, but 8 percent of the 
Negro homemakers in the schedule group 
reported parboiling cabbage one time. 
About 10 percent of the cabbage prepara- 
tion records kept by Negro homemakers 
showed soda added during cooking. 
About one-fourth of the Negro home- 
makers in the schedule study reported 
using soda in cooking cabbage. 



Negro women in the schedule study 
reported an interval of one and one-half 
hours (median time) from the time of 
putting cabbage on the stove to serving 
it. Cabbage preparation records kept by 
Negro women showed a median time of 
45 minutes from putting on the range 
to completing cooking. In 70 percent 
of these records, there was an interval 
of 30 minutes (median time) from time 
of completing cooking to serving. 

The leafy vegetable reports also per- 
mit comparison of preparation of cabbage 
and new cabbage. There was little if any 
difference in preparation methods used 
in preparing mature and young cabbage. 
Whatever difference there was could be 
attributed to more white families, fewer 
Negro families in the new cabbage group; 
more Negro families, fewer white families 
in the cabbage group. 

Fresh Legumes 

Preparation reports of four different 
fresh legumes were secured: butter beans, 
(lima beans) string beans (shelled), Eng- 
lish peas, field peas (cow peas) and mix- 
tures of the same. (See table 2 in the 
Appendix.) Five hundred and sixty- 
seven reports were obtained; 275 were 
from the record study. The record study 
was made in the summer when butter 
beans, string beans, and field peas were 
in season. 

In both schedule studies, all 684 home- 
makers were asked three questions (based 
on findings of record studies) about shell- 
ing green butter beans and field peas 
ahead: (1) Are green butter beans and 
peas shelled more than one-half hour 

before cooking: often sometimes 

never ? (2) Are green butter beans 

and peas purchased shelled: often 

sometimes never ? (3) If pur- 
chased shelled or if shelled ahead, where i 
are they kept before cooking: refriger- 
ator table in kitchen window 

back porch in pan of cool water ? 

Forty-five percent stated that they nev- 
er shelled beans and peas more than one-

half hour before cooking, 28 percent stat- 
ed that they seldom did, and 27 percent 
that they often did. Seventy-six percent 
stated that they never purchased beans 
and peas already shelled. Tw^enty per- 
cent said they did sometimes, and 4 per- 
cent that they did often. Seventy percent 
of those shelling beans and peas ahead 
or purchasing them shelled kept these 
vegetables in the refrigerator until cook- 
ing time, 22 percent kept them on the 
table in the kitchen, and the remainder 
in a windov^, on the back porch, or in a 
pan of cool water. Only two homemak- 
ers reported using a pan of cool water. 

The typical pattern followed by home- 
makers in the record study was to shell 
beans and peas shortly before cooking. 
However, about 8 percent of the cookings 
or lots for which preparation records were 
kept were shelled ahead. This practice 
was more common in the group of fam- 
iUes in which there were young children. 
The supply of fresh legumes used by 
most homemakers was home produced. 

Soaking shelled peas and beans in wa- 
ter before cooking was somewhat less 
common in the case of legumes than of 
leafy vegetables. In a little less than one- 
tenth of the legume preparation records, 



soaking was reported. It was reported 
three times more frequently by Negro 
than white women. No homemaker said 
that fresh legumes were soaked in soda 
water. 

In about three-fourths of the preparation 
reports for English peas, butter beans, and 
field peas the vegetable was started in 
cold water. In the preparation of butter 
beans and field peas, one or more thin 
slices of salt pork or bacon were usually 
added at the beginning. However, but- 
ter or oleo was the most common season- 
ing used for English peas. About one- 
half of the homemakers reported season- 
ing English peas with butter or oleo. 
One-fourth of the lots of butter beans for 
which records were kept were seasoned 
with butter or oleo. Only four of the 
124 lots of field peas were seasoned with 
butter or oleo. In 114 of the 292 reports 
on English peas and in 2 of the 145 rec- 
ords on butter beans, milk, white sauce 
or cream was used. 

Only five homemakers reported addi- 
tion of soda during cooking of fresh 
legumes. None reported parboiling them. 

About one-third of the homemakers re- 
ported addition of sugar to English peas. 
In about one-fifth of the butter bean 



10 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



records and one-tenth of the field pea 
records it was added. In about one-half 
of the legume reports salt was not added 
until the beans or peas were tender. One- 
third reported salt added at the time of 
putting the legume on the range. 

In table 2 is given median, minimum, 
and maximum time between putting on 
to cook and serving, time between put- 
ting on the range and completing cook- 
ing, and time between completing cook- 
ing and serving of the fresh legumes for 
which preparation information was se- 
cured. As will be noted median interval 
between putting on range and serving 
was greater for field peas than for but- 
ter beans and English peas. Field peas 
was the legume most often seasoned with 
salt pork; English peas, the least often 
seasoned with salt pork. As in the case 
of leafy vegetables, there was great varia- 
tion in cooking time. 

Two-thirds of the lots of butter beans 
and field peas for which records were 
kept had an interval between completing 
cooking and serving. About 80 percent 
of each of these lots of vegetables were 
held on the back of the stove; about 17 
percent, on the dining table; and the re- 
mainder, in the warmer of the range. 

Very few homemakers reported pot 
liquor from legumes not eaten. About 
one in ten of the butter bean and field 
pea records showed pot liquor not eaten. 
Only 5 percent of the homemakers re- 
porting on preparation of English peas 
stated that there was generally pot liquor 
which family members did not consume. 

In relatively more of the white record- 
keeping families residing in houses of 
higher rent or rental value, there was no 
interval between completing cooking and 
serving beans and peas. Negro home- 
makers more often cooked beans and 
peas ahead than white families with the 
same rent or rental value. 

Ninety-four women kept one prepara- 
tion record of butter beans. Eighteen 
kept two preparation records and five 



women kept three preparation records.-*^ 
One lot of beans was rarely prepared just 
exactly as another, but there was much 
more variation in usual methods used by 
different women than in methods used 
in these different cookings by any one 
woman. A homemaker who started but- 
ter beans in cold water one morning usu- 
ally started them in cold water another 
morning. One who completed cooking 
butter beans well before serving time on 
Tuesday usually completed cooking them 
well before serving time on Friday. 

Roots and Tubers | 

Preparation reports of seven different 
roots and tubers were obtained: beets, car- 
rots, onions, Irish potatoes, sweet pota- 
toes, rutabagas, and turnips. (See table 
2 in the Appendix.) 

In all of the 2,032 reports obtained, 
only 175 were from the record study. 
Seventy-eight percent of the 175 were 
records of Irish potatoes. At the time 
of the study, Irish potatoes were in sea- 
son, but not sweet potatoes. The supply 
of sweet potatoes from the previous sea- 
son had been used up and the new supply 
was not available, except in very limited 
amounts. 

Most of the homemakers giving re- 
ports on preparation of beets, onions, 
turnips, new Irish potatoes, and carrots 
stated that the supply was home produc- 
ed. Forty-seven percent of the lots of 
Irish potatoes from the record study were 
home produced. The study was made 
after the home producedi supply of many 
families was exhausted. Bliss Triumph 
is the most common variety of Irish po- 
tato grown in Mississippi. It is popular 
because it is an early potato and because 
gardeners are accustomed to growing a 
red variety. However, it does not keep 
so well. For this reason, many garden- 
ers produce only a limited supply. About 
one-third of the homemakers reported 

•^Cooperators were asked not to turn in any 
more than three preparation records for any one 
food served during the report week. 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 



11 



producing most of their supply of sweet 
potatoes. Only two homemakers report- 
ed rutabagas were home produced. Ruta- 
bagas are less suitable for Mississippi 
climatic conditions than are many other 
vegetables and are, hence, seldom pro- 
duced. 

Roots and tubers were generally scrap- 
ed, peeled, or skinned before cooking, ex- 
cept for beets and sweet potatoes. Bak- 
ing was the method of preparation re- 
ported by 60 percent of the homemakers 
giving preparation information about 
sweet potatoes. Soaking of roots and tub- 
ers before cooking was not a common 
practice except for Irish potatoes. About 
one-fifth of the homemakers interviewed 
about new Irish potatoes reported soaking 
them in water before cooking. In 14 
percent of the Irish potato records turned 
in, the potatoes were soaked before cook- 
ing. 

Homemakers varied considerably as to 
the practice of cooking roots and tubers 
whole or in pieces. Beets were always 
cooked whole, and all homemakers except 
4 percent reported new Irish potatoes 
cooked whole. Carrots, turnips and ruta- 
bagas were almost always cut up before 
cooking. About three-fourths of the lots 
of mature Irish potatoes of which pre- 
paration records were kept were sliced 
or cut up before cooking. About one- 
third of the homemakers reporting on 
onions and sweet potatoes said these two 
vegetables were usually cut up before 
cooking. 

Boiling was the method of cooking 
used in preparation of leafy vegetables 
and legumes, but other methods of cook- 
ing were most frequently used by a num- 
ber of homemakers in cooking certain 
of the roots and tubers. Twenty-seven 
percent of the homemakers reported that 
frying was the most frequent meth- 
od of cooking onions. Ten percent re- 
ported that sweet potatoes were most 
frequently fried. Of the records of Irish 
potatoes kept during the record study, 18 



percent were of fried Irish potatoes. Four 
percent were of baked Irish potatoes. 
Fifty-seven percent of the women inter- 
viewed about preparation of sweet pota- 
toes stated that baking was the most 
common method of preparation. Boiling 
was the method of cooking beets, car- 
rots, new Irish potatoes, rutabagas, and 
turnips. 

In about 90 percent of the boiled beets, 
new Irish potato, and onion reports, in 
80 percent of the Irish potato reports, 
in nearly 70 percent of the carrot and 
sweet potato reports, and in 45 percent 
of the rutabaga and turnip reports, the 
vegetables were started in cold water. 

Beets were always drained. New Irish 
potatoes were almost without exception 
drained. In about 60 percent of the boil- 
ed mature Irish potato reports and 33 
percent of the boiled sweet potato reports, 
the potatoes were drained. Nearly 20 
percent reported drainage of boiled onions 
before seasoning. Sixteen percent of the 
homemakers reporting on carrots said 
they drained the liquor. Turnips and 
rutabagas were rarely drained. 

Boiled beets were most frequently sea- 
soned with sugar and vinegar; onions, 
carrots, and new Irish potatoes with but- 
ter or oleo (about 40 percent of the home- 
makers reported that milk was added to 
new Irish potatoes). Boiled sweet pota- 
toes were most frequently candied. Tur- 
nips and rutabagas were generally cook- 
ed with salt pork. About one-fourth 
of the lots of boiled mature potatoes for 
which records were kept were served as 
salad, one-fourth as stewed or boiled po- 
tatoes, and one-half as mashed potatoes. 
Mature potatoes were more often sea- 
soned with grease than were new pota- 
toes. However, the majority used but- 
ter or oleo for seasoning mature Irish 
potatoes. In 24 of the 53 lots of mashed 
potatoes, milk was added. 

The practice of parboiling roots and 
tubers was rarely reported, except in the 
case of new Irish potatoes. Two hun- 



12 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



dred and fifty-two of the 400 families 
parboiled new Irish potatoes; 212 par- 
boiled one time, 29 parboiled two times, 
and 11 parboiled more than two times. 
Only 72 of the 252 women parboiling 
new potatoes were Negro women. Nine 
white women and four Negro women 
added soda during parboiling. Ten of 
the 93 women reporting on preparation 
of rutabagas and three of the 315 re- 
porting on preparation of turnips men- 
tioned adding soda during cooking. Young 
turnips are usually cooked with turnip 
greens. It is only the more mature turn- 
ips that are cooked alone. 

Salt was most often added to roots 
and tubers when tender or done, and 
least often during cooking. Thirty-five 
of the 183 women reporting on prepara- 
tion of fried and boiled sweet potatoes 
stated that they did not use salt. One 



hundred and forty-nine of the 349 re-l 
porting on preparation of beets stated that 
they did not use salt. These were wom- 
en giving a record of preparation fori 
pickled beets. 

Ninety percent of the homemakers re- 
ported using sugar in preparation of' 
beets; 40 percent in preparation of sweet 
potatoes; 20 percent in preparation of 
carrots; 15 percent in preparation of 
turnips; and 14 percent in preparation of 
rutabagas. It was used by less than 10 1 
percent of the women in preparation of 
onions and Irish potatoes. 

As will be noted in table 3, time be- 
tween putting roots and tubers on the 
range and serving, between putting on 
to cook and completing cooking and be- 
tween completing cooking and serving 
varied greatly for any particular vege- 
table.

PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 



L3 



The period between putting on to cook 
and serving was greatest for beets, but 
most of the beets were served cold, as 
pickled beets. They were prepared well 
in advance of the time to serve. Fam- 
ilies reporting on buttered beets (38 so 
reported) had a shorter interval between 
beginning cooking and serving. Median 
time was IK hours. 

Median cooking time (time from put- 
ting on stove to completing cooking) was 
35 minutes for cut up potatoes; 50 min- 
utes for whole Irish potatoes. About two- 
thirds of the Irish potato records showed 
a holding period; that is, an interval be- 
tween completing preparation and serv- 
ing. 

At the time of making this study, the 
pressure sauce pan was not available. A 
number of families owned steam pressure 
canners, but these were not ordinarily 
used for cooking vegetables. 

Discarding pot liquor from roots and 
tubers was uncommon. In about 6 per- 
cent of the onion and carrot preparation 
records, pot liquor not consumed was re- 
ported. In the other vegetables of this 
group, less than 1 percent reported pot 
liquor left. Draining of roots and tubers 
before adding seasoning was common, 
especially in certain of the vegetables, and 
for this reason, there would be in many 
cases no liquor to consume. 

Other Fresh Vegetables 

Preparation reports of nine other fresh 
vegetables were obtained: string beans, 
cauliflower, corn, eggplant, okra, green 
pepper, summer squash, tomato, and veg- 
etable mixture (three or more fresh vege- 
tables). In all, 1,849 reports were se- 
cured. Two hundred and eighty-one of 
these were from the record study; the re- 
mainder from the two schedule stu- 
dies. 

From 66 to 88 percent of the home- 
makers reporting on eight of the nine 
vegetables stated that the supply was usu- 
ally heme produced. The ninth vege- 
table — cauliflower —was purchased by 



those using it. Cauliflower is not gen- 
erally grown in Mississippi. 

In preparation for cooking, string beans 
were broken into small pieces (no home- 
maker reported shredding string beans. 
Only 11 reported cooking them whole, 
and 10 of these were reports of "new" 
string beans). Thirteen of the 24 rec- 
ords on cauliflower stated that cauliflow- 
er was cooked whole; 11, that it was 
broken into flowerets. Seventeen percent 
of the corn reports showed it cooked 
on the cob, 83 percent cut and scraped 
from the cob. Eggplant, squash, tomato 
and vegetable mixture were cut up or slic- 
ed before cooking. Okra was usually 
boiled whole. 

Soaking in water before cooking was 
a practice rarely followed, except in pre- 
paring cauliflower and eggplant. One- 
fourth of those reporting on cauliflower 
and nearly one half of those reporting on 
eggplant said they soaked the vegetable 
before cooking. Eggplant to be fried 
was generally sliced and soaked in cool 
water, usually salt water, before cook- 
ing. 

As in the case of roots and tubers, fry- 
ing was the method of cooking most oft- 
en used by some of the homemakers for 
certain of these other vegetables. Eighty- 
four percent of those reporting on egg- 
plant stated that frying was the most 
common method. Proportions reporting 
frying as the usual method of prepara- 
tion of other vegetables in this group 
were: 33 percent okra, 7 percent tom- 
atoes (green tomatoes), and 7 percent 
corn. Homemakers cooking corn with 
lard or bacon or salt pork grease and add- 
ing no liquid were classified as frying 
corn. 

The sliced eggplant was dipped in 
flour, cornmeal, or a batter of flour, eggs, 
and milk, before frying. Twenty-seven 
of the 132 homemakers reported tliat 
eggplant was usually first boiled, then 
drained, mashed, salt and flour added, 
and the eggplant batter resulting fried. 



14 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



Okra was generally dipped in cornmeai; 
green tomatoes in either flour or corn- 
meal before frying. 

String beans, cauliflower, corn, squash, 
tomato, and vegetable mixture were gen- 
erally started in a litde cold water. In 
about one-half of the reports, okra was 
started in cold water; in the other half, 
in boiling water. In this latter group, 
there were a number in which the okra 
had been cooked on the top of boiling 
field peas. 

String beans was the only vegetable in 
this group usually seasoned with salt 
pork. In about 85 percent of the string 
bean records, it was the fat used. Stew- 
ing was the usual method of preparation 
by 75 percent of those reporting on corn. 
Stewed corn was generally seasoned with 
bacon or salt pork grease. Only about 
33 percent reported butter or oleo and 
16 percent milk used. Squash was like- 
wise usually seasoned with grease. 

Cauliflower was seasoned with butter 
or oleo by one-half of the group and 
with white sauce by the other half. Okra, 
tomatoes, and vegetable mixture were 
seasoned with butter or oleo by the ma- 
jority. In the 19 records of vegetable 
mixture and in 10 of the 21 records of 
fresh tomatoes, soup was made. This soup 
was generally prepared by adding a lit- 
tle water to the tomato or to the vege- 
table mixture, boiling, adding fat (gen- 
erally butter or oleo), salt, pepper and 
oftentimes a little sugar. Spaghetti was 
reported as being added in several of the 
lots of tomato soup. In all of the vege- 
table mixtures except one, fresh tomatoes 
were used (canned tomatoes was used in 
this lot). In 13, butter beans were used; 
in 12, okra; in 10, corn; in 10, onion; in 
9, potato. Other fresh vegetables found 
in not more than four of the records were 
carrots, peppers, and field peas. 

The majority reporting on cauliflower 
drained it before adding butter, oleo, or 
white sauce. Other vegetables which were 
drained by about one-third reporting were 



okra, eggplant, and squash. Corn cooked 
on the cob was, of course, drained. 

The practices of parboiling vegetables 
and of adding soda during cooking were 
limited in this group of other vegetables 
to preparation of string beans. About 1 
percent of those reporting on string beans 
and 4 percent on new string beans re- 
ported parboiling. Six percent showed 
the use of soda in cooking string beans, i 
and 9 percent in cooking new string 
beans. 

Salt was more often added after the 
vegetable was tender in the preparation of 
string beans, cauliflower, and squash. In i 
one-fifth of the string bean records, in 
one-third of the new string bean records, 
in about four-tenths of the corn records, 1 
and in one-third of the squash records, 
a little sugar was added. Sugar was also 
found in most of the preparation records 
of fresh tomatoes and of vegetable mix- 
tures. 

As will be noted in table 4, median 
interval between putting on the range 
and serving, for string beans, was greater 
than for the other vegetables listed. Cook- 
ing time was as great for scalloped egg- 
plant as for new string beans, but the 
eggplant must be boiled first on the top 
of the stove and then baked in an oven 
after other ingredients, such as eggs, | 
bread crumbs, onions, milk, were added. 

There was great variation in time of 
preparing vegetables by different home- 
makers. For example, in the record 
study, one homemaker cooked string j 
beans 20 minutes; another, 2 hours and ! 
35 minutes. One homemaker cooked okra 
15 minutes; another, V/z hours. 

In this study, 50 reports of string beans 
were obtained by the record method and 
259 by the schedule method. Only one of 
the lots in the record study (2 percent) 
showed the use of soda in cooking string 
beans, while 7 percent of the reports in 
the schedule study showed the use of 
soda. Intervals between putting on the j 
range and serving in the two groups I 
were similar.

Practices in preparation of new string 
beans differed very litde from practices 
in preparation of string beans. 

Canned Vegetables 

Preparation reports of 22 different can- 
ned vegetables were secured: butter beans, 
pork and beans, string beans, beets 
(roots), cabbage, carrots, Swiss chard, 
corn, eggplant, kraut, mustard, okra, 
English peas, field peas, sweet potatoes, 
spinach, squash, tomatoes, turnip greens, 
pumpkin, and vegetable mixtures (table 
2 in Appendix). In all, 1,712 reports 
were obtained; only 60 of these were se- 
cured from the record study. The rec- 
ord study, as has been stated before, was 
made at a time when a plentiful supply 
of fresh vegetables was available in many 
of the home gardens. Twenty-four of 
the 60 records were preparation records 
of canned English peas. 



As will be noted in table 5, the supply 
of canned asparagus, pork and beans, 
corn, English peas, sweet potatoes, and 
spinach was purchased by the majority of 
homemakers reporting for these v ege- 
tables. Those giving reports on canJied 
string beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, kraut, 
mustard, field peas, squash, and vege- 
table mixture usually canned their sup- 
ply at home (table 5). 

Cabbage, kraut, and tomatoes were the 
vegetables in which one-third or more 
of the women reported ordinarily using 
the open kettle method. The water bath 
method was most frequently used by 
50 percent or more of those reporting on 
home canning of string beans, cabbage, 
and vegetable mixtures; the steam pres- 
sure method by 50 percent or more of 
those reporting on home canning of 
corn, mustard, okra, squash, and turnip

greens. Oven canning was seldom re- 
ported as the usual method of canning 
a particular vegetable. 

Findings of this study in regard to 
method of canning used were not out of 
line with those of the study made by the 
Bureau of Agricultural Economics in 
1945. In this study, 38 percent of farm 
homemakers reported using the open ket- 
de method for canning tomatoes, 12 per- 
cent for other vegetables. Thirty-one 
percent reported using the water bath 
method for canning tomatoes; 43 per- 
cent in canning other vegetables. Eleven 
percent reported using the pressure can- 
ner for canning tomatoes; 35 percent for 
canning other vegetables. 

From one-third to one-half of the 
homemakers reported canned string 



beans, mustard, English peas, and squash 
either drained or partly drained before 
heating, or drained after heating before 
adding seasoning. Canned asparagus, 
beets, cabbage, carrots, eggplant, kraut, 
okra, spinach, and turnip greens were re- 
ported by from 55 to 100 percent of the 
homemakers as usually drained or partly 
drained before heating, or drained after 
heating and before adding the seasoning. 
Pork and beans, tomatoes, and vege- 
table mixture were the only canned vege- 
tables of which there were several rec- 
ords, where draining was not reported. 

Twenty-three of the 59 women report- 
ing on canned kraut stated that they not 
only drained, but also washed before 
heating. Seven reported soaking it in 
cold water before cooking. Other can- 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 



17 



ned vegetables in which washing and 
soaking were reported by several were: 
string beans, cabbage, okra, and turnip 
greens. 

Draining was more common in case 
of canned leafy vegetables than of canned 
legumes. However, the practice of drain- 
ing varied among the different leafy and 
legume vegetables. For example, 81 per- 
cent of the homemakers stated that they 
drained kraut; 47 percent that they drain- 
ed mustard greens. Thirty-seven per- 
cent reported draining English peas; 15 
percent, field peas. 

Salt pork was used much less often in 
seasoning canned vegetables than in sea- 
soning fresh vegetables. In only two of 
the 22 canned vegetables for which there 
were records, turnip greens and string 
beans, pork was used more often than 
grease. Butter beans, squash, and spin- 
ach were most often seasoned with bacon 
or salt pork grease. 

Favorite seasoning or ways of cooking 
fresh vegetables were, however, impor- 
tant in canned vegetables. For example, 
butter or oleo was an important seasoning 
for fresh carrots, English peas, and okra. 
It was often used also in seasoning can- 
ned carrots, canned English peas, and 
canned okra. Frying was an important 
method of preparing fresh eggplant and 
fresh okra. It was also frequently used 
in preparing canned eggplant and okra. 
Pickled beets was the favorite vegetable 
dish made from fresh beets. It was also 
the favorite from canned beets. 

Canned tomatoes and vegetable mixtures 
were most frequently served in soup — 
usually a soup with water, fat and season- 
ings added. Meat or meat stock was used, 
but by about one-third of those report- 
ing. 

Some practices used with fresh vege- 
tables, such as adding soda during cook- 
ing, were rarely reported in connection 
with preparation of canned vegetables. 
Only seven women giving information 
about preparing string beans stated that 
soda was added in cooking. Seven home- 



makers reported its use in connection with 
preparing canned tomato dishes. Its use 
was not mentioned in connection with 
preparation of the other 20 canned vege- 
tables. , 

Sugar was about as frequently used 
in preparation of canned vegetables as 
it was in preparation of fresh vegetables. 
It was most often used in the prepara- 
tion of canned beets, tomatoes, sweet po- 
tatoes, English peas, mustard, and turnip 
greens. Salt was not always added, since 
vegetables are salted in canning, and 
since they were often seasoned with sal- 
ty grease or pork. However, when salt 
was used, the time of adding was very 
likely to be at the beginning of the 
preparation process. 

In scheduling preparation of canned 
vegetables, homemakers seem to allow 
about one-half less time interval between 
starting to cook and serving than in the 
case of fresh vegetables (table 6). Hold- 
ing period, as well as cooking period, A 
canned vegetables was less than of fresh 
vegetables. Thus median time between 
putting on to cook and serving fresh 
string beans was 135 minutes; of canned 
string beans, 60 minutes, for families in 
the schedule studies. For those in the 
record studies, median time between put- 
ting on to cook and completing cooking 
was, for fresh beans, 90 minutes; for 
canned beans, 45 minutes. Median time 
between completing cooking and serving 
was 30 minutes for the former, and 15 
minutes for the latter. 

As in the case of fresh vegetables, there 
was great variation in cooking time used 
by different homemakers. 

It is interesting here to note that the 
fresh vegetables which received longest 
cooking period were usually the canned 
vegetables which also received longest 
cooking. Vegetables which received short- 
est cooking period when fresh, usually re- 
ceived it when canned. Thus, both 
fresh and canned string beans, field peas, 
and turnip greens received the longer 
cooking periods; both fresh and canned

English peas, okra, and spinach, the 
shorter cooking periods. 

The practice of not consuming pot 
Hquor was less common in canned than 
fresh vegetables, no doubt because so 
many homemakers drained canning 
liquid before seasoning. Fifteen women 
reported canned butter bean pot liquor: 
seven canned string bean pot liquor; 
three canned spinach and canned turnip 
green pot liquor, not consumed by the 
family. Pot liquor is seasoned liquid in 
vegetable at time of serving. 

Dried Vegetables 

Preparation reports of three dried vege- 
tables (all legumes) were secured — but- 
ter) (lima) beans, navy beans, and field 
peas. (See table 2 in Appendix.) A 
total of 474 preparation reports was ob- 
tained, 29 in the record study and the 



remainder by personal interview with 
the homemaker. 

Most homemakers stated that the dried 
peas and beans used by the family were 
purchased. As has already been pointed 
out, home canning or fresh butier beans 
and field peas was quite common. Evi- 
dendy, these small-town women prefer- 
red to store the legumes they produced 
canned in the green state rather than 
dried. 

Practices in soaking field peas and but- 
ter beans before cooking were similar 
(table 7). In both, overnight soaking 
was most common. Those not soaking 
overnight usually soaked 3 hours or less. 
Differences in soaking practices of but- 
ter beans and field peas and of navy 
beans may be accounted for by the fact 
diat there were only 10 preparation rec-

ords of navy beans, and 9 of these were 
furnished by Negro women. Seven 
homemakers reported adding soda to 
soaking water of butter beans; six, to 
soaking water of field peas. Fourteen 
women reported soaking butter beans 
and 21 soaking field peas in hot water 
rather than cold. 

About one-fifth of those reporting on 
preparation of dry legumes parboiled 
them. Some women parboiled rather 
than soaked them, though a number 
reported both practices. 

Dried legumes were usually started in 
cold water with a piece of raw salt pork. 
More than half of the women said they 
added the salt after the beans or peas were 
tender. These practices correspond rath- 
er closely with practices in connection 
with cooking the fresh beans and peas. 

The principal differences in prepara- 
tion of dry and fresh beans and peas were 
a longer cooking period for the dry beans 
and peas (table 8), and more frequent 
use of soda in cooking. Dry field peas 
were cooked a little more than were dry 
butter beans, and navy beans were cook- 
ed longest of all. The higher proportion 
of preparation records from Negroes than 
whites in the record sample than in the 



schedule samples may account for long- 
er cooking periods used in the record 
group. 

Fourteen homemakers reported using 
soda in cooking dry peas and 13 in cook- 
ing dry butter beans. Although the prac- 
tice of adding soda was much more fre- 
quent than in the case of the fresh vege- 
tables, it was followed by only one out 
of 20 women reporting. 

Less than 1 percent of the group re- 
ported pot liquor not consumed by the 
family. The legumes were evidently 
cooked low and there was little if any 
pot liquor to consume. 

Frozen Vegetables 

Preparation reports of only six frozen 
vegetables were secured: butter beans, 
mustard, okra, English peas, field peas, 
and turnip greens. Only 37 reports were 
obtained (table 2 in Appendix). Most 
of these reports were secured from wom- 
en in Marks and Tunica, the two towns 
with cold storage lockers. Use of frozen 
vegetables was limited to the higher rent 
or rental value white groups. No Negro 
family or white family with rent or rent- 
al value of $20 and less reported on the 
preparation of frozen vegetables.

About two-thirds of those reporting on 
preparation of frozen vegetables report- 
ed on vegetables which they had put in 
the community freezer locker plant. As 
will be noted from table 9, vegetables ob- 
tained from the locker plant with the 
exception of field peas, were usually har- 
vested the morning of the day sent to 
the locker plant. Field peas were most 
frequently harvested the afternoon before. 
Several women reported purchasing field 
peas from farmers who gathered them in 
the late afternoon and delivered them 
early the next morning. 

Butter beans and field peas which took 
longer to prepare for blanching and 
packing were less likely to get to the lock- 
er plant in the morning. However, the 
number of records of other vegetables 
is limited. About half of the vegetables 
for which reports were given reached the 
plant in the morning, the remainder in 
the afternoon. 

Blanching and packing of vegetables 
for the locker was done in the home, in 
three-fourth of the reports. It was done 
at the locker plant in the other fourth. 

In 25 of the 37 reports on frozen vege- 



tables, they were put on the range while 
still frozen. Two reported partly thaw- 
ing and nine completely thawing. In one 
report it was stated that no set procedure 
was followed. 

Starting the frozen vegetable to cook 
in a little cold water seemed to be the 
practice of the majority. Frozen vege- 
tables were seasoned very much as were 
fresh vegetables, except butter or oleo 
was more frequently used in seasoning 
butter beans and English peas than in 
seasoning these vegetables when fresh. 
This may have been because families 
using frozen butter beans and English 
peas were in higher rent or rental value 
groups or groups in which use of butter 
or oleo for seasoning these legumes was 
more common. Salt pork was generally 
used in seasoning frozen field peas and 
frozen greens, as it was in seasoning 
these vegetables when fresh. 

Median time from putting frozen vege- 
tables on the range to serving was about 
half of that for fresh vegetables. Vege- 
tables receiving longest cooking when 
fresh, that is, field peas, and turnip 
greens, received longest cooking when

frozen (table 10). There was great varia- 
tion in minimum and maximum interval 
between putting on to cook and serving 
reported by different homemakers pre- 
parmg the same frozen vegetable. 

Practices such as parboiling and addi- 
tion of soda were not reported in cook- 
ing frozen vegetables. 

The women reporting on preparation 
of frozen vegetables were asked if they 
considered the frozen vegetable: as good, 
not quite as good, not nearly as good, 
as the fresh vegetable. In 19 of the 37 
reports, the homemaker stated as good, 
in 15 not quite as good, and m 3 not 
nearly as good. One woman reporting on 
frozen okra and two on frozen field peas 
reported them not nearly so good. 

Raw Vegetable Dishes 

Preparation reports of four kinds of 
raw vegetable dishes were secured: sliced 
tomatoes, cole slaw, orher mixed vege- 
table salads, and congealed vegetable salad 
(see table 2 in Appendix). In all, 643 
reports were obtained — 121 in the rec- 
ord study and 522 in one of the schedule 
studies. 

In preparing cabbage for slaw, two- 
thirds of those reporting said they cut 
the cabbage with a knife. Fourteen per- 
cent grated the cabbage and 3 percent 
ground it in a meat chopper. The re- 
mainder (about 16 percent) shredded it 
in a shredder. 



About 10 percent of the women re- 
porting on cole slaw said they generally 
used a dressing of vinegar and season- 
ings. Most of the others used either salad 
dressing or mayonnaise; less than 5 per- 
cent used French dressing. Salad dress- 
ings or mayonnaise were also used by 
the great majority on other mixed vege- 
table salads and congealed vegetable sal- 
ads. 

Vegetables most often reported used 
in other mixed vegetable salads and in 
congealed vegetable salads were toma- 
toes, celery, peppers, carrots, lettuce, 
onions, radishes and cabbage. 

In table 11, time scheduling in con- 
nection with raw vegetable dishes is giv- 
en. In the interval between completed 
preparation and serving, one-half of the 
lots of tomatoes in which there was an 
interval were kept in the refrigerator, the 
remainder on the dining table. Other 
raw vegetable dishes prepared ahead were 
as a rule kept in the refrigerator. How- 
ever, about one-fourth of the homemak- 
ers reporting on cole slaw stated that 
they placed the slaw on the dining tabic 
as soon as preparation was complete. 

Storage From One Meal 
to the Next 

One of the questions on the forms 
used by homemakers keeping prepara- 
tion records concerned whether the vege- 
table dish was eaten at another meal. 
If so, where it had been stored and how

prepared. Forty-nine percent of the cook- 
ed vegetable dishes for which records 
were kept were served at another meal, 
usually at supper. In the interval, a 
little more than one-half (54 percent) 
of the vegetables were stored in the re- 
frigerator, about one-fourth on the din- 
ing table or in a cabinet, and the re- 
mainder in the oven, the warming oven, 
or on the top of the stove. All except 
13 of the 160 families included in the 
record study owned a refrigerator. 

The practice of storing left-over vege- 
tables on the table, in a cabinet, or on 
the stove was a practice carried over 
from the time when there were no re- 
frigerators. The factor responsible for 
continuation of this practice on the part 
of some is preference for vegetables such 
as those that remain at room temperature. 
Then, too, space is often limited in re- 
frigerators. About one-fifth (21 percent) of 
the left-over cooked vegetables were heat- 
ed before serving. 

In 11 percent of the tomato records, 
45 percent of the cole slaw records, and 
30 percent of the other mixed vegetable 
salad records, there were left-overs for 
the next meal. However, in all cases, 
these were stored in the refrigerator in 
the interval between the two meals in 
which they were served. 



Methods of Preparing Vege- 
tables Compared With 
Recommended Procedures 
Cooked Vegetable Dishes 

Fresh Leafy Vegetables 

Seventy-six percent of the homemakers 
questioned reported that all stems of 
greens were discarded. Forty-eight per- 
cent reported stripping centers (remov- 
ing the midrib) when greens were old 
and tough, and 4 percent reported strip- 
ping centers always. Since stems and 
midribs have a lower mineral and vita- 
min content than do leaves, the practice 
of discarding stems and midribs is 
sound. This is especially true for fam- 
ilies who produce their greens and have 
a large supply to draw from, as did fam- 
ilies of this study. Also, by discarding 
tough stems and midribs, it is possible 
to reduce cooking time and hence, losses 
in cooking. 

About one-half of the women report- 
ed that they tore up or stripped large 
leaves before cooking. Small leaves were 
generally cooked whole. About two- 
thirds reported that they cut cabbage in 
small pieces before cooking. These pro- 
cedures shorten the cooking period and 
for this reason are desirable. However, 
when vegetables are cut up, losses in nu- 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 23 



trients arc greater if pot liquor is not 
consumed. 

Soaking leafy vegetables in water be- 
fore cooking was reported for about 10 
percent of the leafy vegetables. This 
practice was much more common in case 
of collards and cabbage than other greens. 
According to recent investigations in nu- 
trition, the loss of vitamins during soak- 
ing is small. Even though the loss is 
small, the practice is useless unless per- 
haps in case of wilted vegetables. How 
much cooking time is reduced and flavor 
improved by soaking wilted vegetables is 
not known. However, it is known that 
soaking wilted vegetables does not re- 
store the vitamin C lost in wilting. 

Most leafy vegetables were started to 
cook in boiling water, usually with a lit- 
tle partly-cooked salt pork. Collards and 
turnip greens were the leafy vegetables 
' most often started in cold water. About 
I one-fifth of the homemakers reported 
starting these two vegetables in cold wa- 
ter with raw salt pork. Nutrition special- 
I ists recommend starting all vegetables in 
! boiling water to shorten cooking time and 
destroy oxidases. 

Approximately one-third of the home- 
makers reported adding salt at the be- 
ginning of the cooking process; another 
' third, during cooking; and the remain- 
der, when tender. The practice of not 
I adding salt until tender may have been 
passed down from the period when large 
amounts of salt were used in curing pork 
and when most vegetables were seasoned 
1 with salt pork. Food specialists recom- 
I mend that salt be added at the beginning 
of the cooking period, as adding then 
tends to preserve ascorbic acid. It also 
[ helps to retain color of the green vege- 
table and improves flavor. 

From 30 to 40 percent of the women 
added sugar to turnip greens, rape, col- 
lards, mustard greens, and kale. Nine- 
teen percent added sugar in preparation 
of cabbage, 15 percent in preparation of 
chard, and 11 percent in preparation of 
tender greens. Less than 10 percent used 



sugar in preparation of spinach or beet 
tops. Adding a little sugar may improve 
flavor, especially if the vegetable is drain- 
ed. Sugar is one of the flavoring sub- 
stances that comes out in the cooking 
water. 

Homemakers stated that vegetables 
were cooked with lid on except cab- 
bage. In cooking cabbage, a number re- 
ported cooking without lid. Beginning 
to cook with the lid reduces the time it 
takes the vegetable to come to the boil- 
ing point. Cooking with the lid after 
the boiling point is reached conserves vi- 
tamin C and fuel. 

Practices such as soaking in soda wa- 
ter, adding soda during cooking, and 
parboiling were not reported for the 
majority in cooking any of the leafy 
vegetables. Use of soda in preparation or 
during cooking of leafy vegetables was 
rare among white women, but fairly 
common among Negro women. It was 
more common in the schedule than in 
the record study. Recent investigations 
have demonstrated that a small amount 
of soda can be added provided cooking 
time is short. 

Parboiling leafy vegetables was most 
common for spinach. About 14 percent 
reported parboiling. Cabbage, turnip 
greens, and mustard greens were other 
vegetables usually parboiled by a few 
homemakers. Parboiling was more com- 
mon in the white than the Negro group. 
Nutrients are lost in parboiling. 

According to the time table for cook- 
ing vegetables in the Handbook of Food 
Preparation-/ boiling time for beet greens 
is 5 to 15 minutes; for green cabbage 
quartered, 10 to 15 minutes; for Swiss 
chard, 10 to 20 minutes; for collards 10 
to 15 minutes; for kale, 10 to 20 minutes; 
and for spinach, 3 to 10 minutes. Time 
for cooking mustard greens, rape, tender 
and turnip greens is not given. However, 

-^Handbook of Food Preparation, American 
Home Economics Association, Washington, 1946, 
p. 41. 



24 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



in School Lunch Recipes issued by the 
Bureau of Human Nutrition and Home 
Economics, a boiling time of from 10 to 
20 minutes is given for mustard and 
turnip greens. Tendergreens are a ten- 
der variety of turnip greens, and rape 
leaves are somewhat similar in texture 
to cabbage leaves, but the leaves are 
deeply lobed. They are not hairy like 
those of the turnip. 

Evidently, the cooking times for col- 
lard, turnip, and mustard greens apply 
to very young vegetables. The more ma- 
ture vegetables would certainly not get 
tender in time recommended. It re- 
quires a comparatively long time to ten- 
der fibrous mature leaves of these leafy 
vegetables. 

Since information regarding cooking 
time obtained from cooperating home- 
makers in this study included time of 
putting the vegetable on the range, time 
of completing cooking and time of serv- 
ing, it is not possible to make exact com- 
parisons with recommended boiling time. 
Ft is, however, possible to make some 
rough comparisons. For example, recom- 
mended boiling time for turnip greens 
is 10 to 20 minutes. Median interval 
from putting turnip greens on the range 
to completing cooking in families in the 
record study was 80 minutes. Median 
interval from completing cooking turnip 
greens to serving in families in the record 
study was 30 minutes. Median interval 
from putting turnip greens on the range 
to serving by those in the schedule stu- 
dies was 120 minutes. It would thus 
seem that even though greens were ma- 
:ure that excessive cooking periods were 
jsed by a number reporting. 

Cabbage, collards, kale, mustard, rape, 
tender and turnip greens were the leafy 
vegetables which seemed to be most oft- 
en overcooked. Spinach, Swiss chard, 
and beet tops were the vegetables which 
seemed to be least often overcooked. The 
former group of vegetables were those 
most often seasoned with salt pork; the 



latter group, those least often seasoned 
with salt pork. Intervals between put 
ting on the range, completing cooking 
and serving were somewhat greater for 
Negro than for white families, somewhat 
greater for families in the schedule stu- 
dies than in the record study. This was 
particularly true of Negro families in 
the record and schedule studies. Nutri- 
tion specialists recommend short cook- 
ing periods, to conserve vitamins. The 
practice of allowing a sufficiently cook- 
ed vegetable to remain on the back of 
the stove or in the warmer until served 
is destructive of vitamins. 

Only 10 percent of the leafy vegetable 
records showed pot liquor not consumed 
by family members. Families in this 
study cooked vegetables down low, so 
that quite a number of women reported 
that there was very little pot liquor to 
consume. Discardiing pot liquor is, of 
course, one method of losing valuable 
nutrients. 

Practices in preparing new cabbage and 
cabbage were similar. There is no rea- 
son why these practices should differ. Be- 
liefs in the evilness of the first "messes" 
of leafy vegetables (on which traditional 
rules for preparing new vegetables are 
based) have no scientific basis. 

Fresh Legumes 

Forty-five percent of the homemakers 
in the schedule studies stated that they 
never shelled beans and peas more than 
one-half hour before cooking; 28 percent 
>tated that they seldom did; and 27 per- 
•ent that they often did. Seventy-six per- 
cent stated that they never purchased 
beans and peas already shelled. Twenty 
percent said they did sometimes, and 
I percent that they often did. Seventy 
□ercent of those shelling beans and peas 
ahead or purchasing them shelled kept 
these vegetables in the refrigerator until 
cooking time. The typical pattern fol- 
lowed by homemakers in the record study 
was to shell beans and peas shortly be- 
fore cooking. However, about 8 percent 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 



25 



of the lots for which preparation rec- 
ords were kept were shelled ahead. Re 
search studies show that beans and peas 
stored in pods lose less vitamin C than if 
stored shelled, that losses are less when 
vegetables are stored in the refrigerator. 

About three-fourths of the preparation 
records of the legumes reported that they 
were started to cook in cold water. As 
mentioned before, nutrition specialists 
recommend starting all vegetables in boil- 
ing water. 

Butter or oleo was the most common 
seasoning used for English peas; salt 
pork, the most common seasoning for 
field peas (cowpeas) and butter beans 
(lima beans). About one-fourth of the 
cookings or lots of butter beans for 
which records were kept were seasoned 
with butter or oleo. Only 4 of the 124 
lots of field peas were seasoned with 
butter or oleo. 

Tn about one-half of the legumes rec- 
ords, it was reported that salt was not 
added until the vegetable was tender. 
The practice was as common in cooking 
English peas as in cooking field peas. 
In other words, salting after tender wns 
not limited to legumes generally seasoned 
with salt pork. 

About one-third of the homemakers 
reported addition of sugar to English 
peas. In about one-fifth of the butter 
bean records and one-tenth of the field 
pea records, it was added. Addition of 
sugar has no effect on nutritive value ex- 
cept in calorics. It may improve flavor. 

Boiling time given for green limas 
Abutter beans) and for English peas in 
the Handbook of Food Preparation was 
20 to 30 minutes for the former and 8 
to 20 minutes for the latter. Boiling time 
was not given in Handbook for field 
peas (cow peas). However, fresh young 
neas should cook tender in 30 minutes. 
Median time between putting on the 
range to cook and completing cooking 
recorded was, for butter beans, 70 min- 
utes; for field peas, 90 minutes. Median 



holding period for both was the same — 
30 minutes. Median interval between 
putting on the range and serving Eng- 
lish peas was 60 minutes. It would thus 
seem that the majority of homemakers 
overcooked legumes. The practice of 
holding warm already overcooked le- 
gumes was also destructive of nutrients. 
In preparation of field peas there was a 
greater interval between putting on the 
range and serving than in case of the 
other 2 legumes. This was the legume 
most often seasoned with salt pork. 

Practices such as soaking in water be- 
fore cooking, parboiling, adding soda and 
discarding pot liquor were uncommon in 
connection with preparation of legumes. 
White homemakers in higher rent or rent- 
al value groups less often cooked legumes 
ahead than did those in lower rent or 
rental value groups. Negro home- 
makers more often cooked beans and peas 
ahead than white homemakers in the 
same rent or rental value group. 
Roots and Tubers 

Roots and tubers (except beets and 
sweet potatoes) were generally scraped, 
peeled or skinned before cooking. Bak- 
ing was the method of preparation report- 
ed by 60 percent of the homemakers giv- 
ing preparation information about sweet 
potatoes. Boiling or baking in jackets is 
a rule usually given by nutrition spe- 
cialists. 

Beets were always cooked whole, and 
all homemakers except 4 percent re- 
ported new Irish potatoes cooked whole. 
Carrots, turnips and rutabagas were 
almost always cut up before cooking. 
About three-fourths of the lots of ma- 
ture Irish potatoes of which preparation 
records were kept were sliced or cut up 
before boiling. About one-third of the 
homemakers reported onions and sweet 
potatoes cut up before boiling. When 
vegetables are cut across fiber, cooking 
losses are greater unless liquor is used. 

Soaking of roots and tubers before 
cooking was not a common practice ex- 



26 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



cept for Irish potatoes. One-fifth of the 
homemakers interviewed about new Irish 
potatoes reported soaking them in water 
before cooking. In 14 percent of the 
mature boiled Irish potato records turned 
in, potatoes were soaked before cooking. 
Soaking potatoes for a short time is prob- 
ably not very destructive of vitamins. 

Boiling was the method of preparing 
beets, carrots, new Irish potatoes, ruta- 
bagas, and turnips. It was also the meth- 
od most frequently used in preparation 
of onions and mature Irish potatoes. How- 
ever, 27 percent reporting on onions and 
18 percent on mature Irish potatoes gave 
preparation for fried onions and pota- 
toes. Baking was the method most oft- 
en reported for sweet potatoes. Only 4 
percent of the preparation records of ma- 
ture Irish potatoes were of baked Irish 
potatoes. Fried vegetables are not as easy 
to digest as are baked and boiled vege- 
tables. 

About 90 percent of the reports on 
boiled beets, new Irish potatoes, and 
onions, 80 percent of the reports on the 
mature Irish potatoes, nearly 70 percent 
of the reports on carrots and sweet 
potatoes, and 45 percent of the reports 
on rutabagas and turnips stated that 
vegetable was started to cook in cold 
water. The practice of starting roots and 
tubers in cold water may be related to the 
preparation rule, "Always put vegetables 
that grow under the ground on in cold 
water, and above the ground in hot 
water," which had been reported by sev- 
eral homemakers as taught by their moth- 
ers or someone else in the parental 
home.-/ This rule has no scientific basis. 

The practice of draining before season- 
ing varied considerably among the dif- 
ferent roots and tubers. Beets were al- 
ways drained. New Irish potatoes were 
almost without exception drained. About 
60 percent of the boiled mature Irish 

-^Traditional Food Preparation Rules, Dorothy 
Dickins, Miss. Agr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 418, June 
1945, p. 29. 



potatoes and 33 percent of the boiled 
sweet potatoes were drained. About 20 
percent of those reporting on boiled 
onion and 16 percent on carrots reported 
draining. Nutrients are lost when the 
vegetable is drained, unless the vegetable 
is cooked with skin or peeling on. 

Turnips and rutabagas were the only 
roots and tubers seasoned with salt pork. 
Butter or oleo was used in seasoning most 
of other roots and tubers except beets, 
which were not ordinarily seasoned with 
fat. 

The practice of parboiling roots and 
tubers was rarely mentioned except for 
new Irish potatoes. Two hundred and 
fifty-two of the 400 families parboiled 
new Irish potatoes; 212 parboiled one 
time, 29 parboiled two times, and 11 par- 
boiled more than two times. Only 72 of 
the 252 women parboiling new potatoes 
were Negro women. The rule, "Par- 
boil new Irish potatoes," as has been 
shown in a previous publication, result- 
ed from the fact that there have been 
persons made ill from eating new pota- 
toes.-/ Most of the cases of illness re- 
ported are said to be due to bacterial 
infection. New potatoes, because of their 
higher content of water, decompose much 
more readily than old ones. 

In preparing boiled or fried roots and 
tubers, salt (if added; it was not used 
by some homemakers in preparing beets 
and sweet potatoes) was most often add- 
ed when the vegetable was tender or 
about done. As mentioned before, food 
specialists usually suggest addition of 
salt at the beginning of cooking. 

Use of soda in cooking roots and tub- 
ers was rare. Pot liquor, when available, 
was generally consumed. 

According to the time table for cook- 
ing vegetables in the Handbook for Food 
Preparation, boiling time for beets was 
30 to 90 minutes, for sliced carrots 10 to 
20 minutes, for onions 15 to 35 minutes, 

7/ibid, p. 25. 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 



27 



for medium whole Irish potatoes 25 to 40 
minutes, for quartered Irish potatoes 15 
to 25 minutes, for whole sweet potatoes 
25 to 35 minutes, for quartered sweet 
potatoes 15 to 25 minutes, for sliced ruta- 
bagas 20 to 30 minutes, and for sliced 
turnips 15 to 20 minutes. Baking time 
given for Irish potatoes was 45 to 60 
minutes, for sweet potatoes 30 to 45 
minutes.-^ 

As will be noted, when comparing 
these boiling times with times listed 'n 
table 3, over-cooking of roots and tubers 
was less on the whole than overcooking 
of leafy vegetables and legumes. How- 
ever, roots and tubers were overcooked, 
or at least kept warm, for excessive pe- 
riods between completing cooking and 
serving. Longer cooking of turnips than 
of carrots may have been due to the fact 
that tuinips were often cooked with salt 
pork. Another factor may be that car- 
rots have been introduced into menus of 
many families fairly recently; that is, 
since the development of the science of 
nutrition. 

All Other Fresh Vegetables 

Before putting on to cook, eggplant, 
squash, tomato, and vegetable mixture 
were cut up or sliced. Corn was cut 
from the cob by 83 percent of those re- 
porting. String beans were almost with 
out exception broken up before cooking. 
Nearly 50 percent reported cauliflower 
broken into flowerets before boiling. Okra 
was usually cooked whole, except for fry- 
ing. When breaking or cutting up before 
cooking reduces cooking time, it is de- 
sirable, especially if pot liquor is con- 
sumed. 

Soaking in water before cooking was 
a practice rarely followed with these oth- 
er vegetables, except in preparing cauli- 
flower and eggplant. Soaking vegetables 
before cooking is probably a traditional 
practice, as evidenced by the fact that ref- 

sVOp. cit. A.H.E.A., p. 41. 



erence to soaking vegetables is found in 
old cook books.^ 

String beans, cauliflower, corn, squash, 
tomato, and vegetable mixture were usu- 
ally started in a little cold water. Okra 
was as often started in boiling as in cold 
water. Other methods than boiling were 
used more often in cooking eggplant 
and peppers. Eggplant was usually fried, 
peppers stuffed and baked. 

String beans were most often seasoned 
with salt pork; corn and squash with 
salt pork or bacon grease; okra, tomatoes 
and vegetable mixture with butter or 
oleo; and cauliflower with butter or oleo, 
or white sauce. 

The majority of homemakers report- 
ed cauliflower drained before adding sea- 
soning. About one-third of the home- 
makers reported draining okra, squash, 
and eggplant. As before stated, nutrients 
are lost in draining. 

Boiling time given in the Handbook 
of Food Preparation was, for string beans 
15 to 30 minutes; for cauliflower whole 
20 to 30 minutes; in flowerets 8 to 15 
minutes; for corn on the cob 5 to 15 
minutes; for eggplant sliced 10 to 20 
minutes; for okra sliced 10 to 20 min- 
utes; for summer squash sliced 10 to 
20 minutes; and for tomatoes 7 to 15 
minutes. Vegetable mixture with but- 
ter beans would take no more than 30 
minutes.--/ 

As will be noted, in comparing these 
recommended boiling times with inter- 
vals between putting on the range, com- 
pleting cooking and serving found in 
table 4, most of these other vegetables 
were overcooked, or kept warm for ex- 
cessive periods after sufficient cooking. 
This seems to be especially true of string 
beans and tomatoes. A boiling time of 
from 15 to 30 minutes is given for string 
beans. Median interval from putting 
on the range to serving reported by home- 
makers in the schedule study was 135 

^/Op. cit., Dickins, p. 20. 
i-O/Op. cit. A.H.E.A., p. 41. 



28 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



minutes. Time between putting on the 
range and completing cooking of those 
in die record study was 90 minutes. 

The most common traditional rule re- 
ported by homemakers in the survey 
study, previously referred to, was one thai 
implied that long cooked string beans 
were more tasteful.^-^ It would seem 
that these traditional rules concerning 
cooking time of string beans were being 
followed at the present time to a large 
extent. Some of the rules were: "Cook 
string beans until they shrivel," "The 
longer you cook string beans, the better 
they are," "String beans have to be 
cooked a long time to be good." 

Tomatoes in soup with meat were 
cooked considerably longer than tomatoes 
in soup without meat. Since fresh toma- 
toes require only a short cooking period, 
it seems desirable when using them in a 
mixture with other vegetables requiring 
longer cooking, to cook other vegetables 
and then add the tomatoes. Such sche- 
duling will conserve vitamin C tor which 
tomato is so valuable. Then, too, acid 
in the tomato delays other vegetables in 
getting tender. Preparation pracdces 
used in cooking string beans and new 
string beans differed little. 

Canned Vegetables 

In the majority of canned vegetables 
for which preparation reports were se- 
cured, the supply was stated as home 
canned. One-third or more of the wom- 
en said they ordinarily used the open 
kettle method in canning cabbage, kraut, 
and tomatoes. The water bath method 
was most frequently used by 50 percent 
or more of those reporting on home can- 
ning of string beans, cabbage, and vege- 
table mixtures; the steam pressure meth- 
od by 50 percent or more of those re- 
porting on home canned corn, mustard 
greens, okra, squash, and turnip greens. 
Oven canning was seldom reported as 
the usual method of canning a particular 

-3-i/Op. cit., Dickins, pp. 28 and 29. 



vegetable. Food specialists recommend 
that tomatoes be canned by the water 
bath method and that all other vege- 
tables be canned in the steam pressure 
canner. Scientific research has shown 
that these are the methods best suited 
for making harmless the organisms which 
are found on the vegetables. 

Twenty-three of the 59 women report- 
ing on canned kraut stated that they 
washed it before heating. Seven re- 
ported soaking it in cold water before 
cooking. Other canned vegetables in 
which washing and soaking were re- 
ported by several were: string beans, 
cabbage, okra, and turnip greens. It is 
possible these practices had been passed 
down from the period when excessive 
amount of salt had been used in making 
kraut, when canning acid or vinegar was 
used in canning nonacid vegetables. 
Washing and soaking canned vegetables 
are undesirable practices, both from the 
standpoint of palatability and nutrition. 
They are unnecessary when good canning 
practices are used. 

From one-third to one-half of the 
homemakers reported canned string 
6eans, mustard, English peas, and squash 
either drained or pardy drained before 
heating, or drained after heating before 
adding seasoning. Canned asparagus, 
beets, cabbage, carrots, eggplant, kraut, 
okra, spinach, and turnip greens were 
reported by from 55 to 100 percent of the 
homemakers as usually drained or part- 
ly drained before heating, or drained aft- 
er heating before adding seasoning. Many 
canned vegetables are more palatable if 
canning liquid is drained and quickly 
evaporated and then added to the vege- 
table. Other uses for canning liquid are 
in gravies, soups, and cocktails. Some 
of the minerals, vitamins, and flavor are 
dissolved in the liquid. 

Canned vegetables were seasoned very 
much as were the vegetables when fresh. 
Salt pork was most often used in season- 
ing string beans and turnip greens, but- 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 



29 



ter or oleo in seasoning carrots and okra. 
However, salt pork was used much less 
frequently — bacon or salt pork grease 
much more frequently — in seasoning can- 
ned vegetables than in seasoning fresh 
vegetables. 

Practices such as adding soda during 
cooking and not consuming pot liquor 
were uncommon. Salt was not always 
used in preparing canned vegetables, 
since it had been added during canning 
and since canned vegetables were often 
seasoned with bacon or salt pork grease. 
When used, however, it was generally 
added at the beginning of the prepara- 
tion process, 
i Sugar was used about as often in prep- 
aration of canned vegetables as in prep- 
aration of fresh vegetables. Adding a 
little sugar would replace the sugar dis- 
solved from the vegetable during the can- 
ning process and would improve the 
flavor. 

Canned vegetables are sufficiently 
cooked and, therefore, need to be heated 
and seasoned only. This is, however, 
not true of nonacid vegetables canned 
at home in the open kettle, water bath, 
or in the oven. Such vegetables should 
be boiled 10 minutes with lid on to in- 
sure destruction of organisms and toxins 
that may be present because of unsafe 
canning methods. Boiling 10 minutes 
is not necessary for nonacid vegetables 
canned by recommended methods; i.e., 
in a steam pressure canner, and for vege- 
tables commercially canned. 

From median intervals between put- 
ting on the range and completing cook- 
ing and between putting on the range 
and serving it would seem that most com- 
mercially canned vegetables as well as 
home canned vegetables were boiled more 
than 10 minutes. In fact, it is probably 
due to the practice of cooking thoroughly 
that there have been so few persons 
made ill from eating nonacid vegetables 
canned at home in the open kettle, wa- 
ter bath, and oven. 



In scheduling preparation of canned 
vegetables, homemakers allowed about 
one-half less time between starting to 
cook and serving than for fresh vege- 
tables. Holding period as well as cook- 
ing period of canned vegetables was also 
less than of fresh vegetables. There were 
some exceptions — canned cabbage, for in- 
stance. Intervals from putting on the 
range to serving were about the same as 
for fresh cabbage. There were only 11 
reports of canned cabbage. It is not a 
palatable product (the flavor, texture and 
color are undesirable). Homemakers who 
can cabbage may be from families hav- 
ing low standards for cooked cabbage. 

The great variation in scheduling used 
in cooking canned tomatoes resulted from 
different uses to which the tomato was 
puL Cooking and holding periods were 
greatest for tomatoes in soup made with 
beef. Long cooking periods of canned 
tomatoes is especially destructive of vi- 
tamin C. 

Dried Vegetables 

About 40 percent of the homemakers 
interviewed stated that they soaked beans 
and peas overnight, about 23 reported 
soaking 1 to 3 hours, about 23 percent 
less than 1 hour, and 14 percent not at 
all. Soaking before cooking shortens the 
cooking period and for this reason is 
desirable. However, soaking to shorten 
the cooking period must continue until 
peas and beans have absorbed enougt 
water to weigh nearly double their dry 
weight. If soaked in cold water this 
will take 7 or 8 hours; if put to soak in 
boiling water, probably 4 or 5 hours is 
sufficient. Negro homemakers much less 
often soaked peas and beans overnight 
than did white homemakers. 

Seven homemakers reported adding 
soda to the soaking water of butter beans, 
six to the soaking water of field peas. 
Snyder found that one-eighth of a tea- 
spoon of soda per pint of water was suf- 
ficient for soaking to shorten the cooking 



30

time except with very hard water.^ 
Soaked beans are lighter in color and 
less strong in flavor than nonsoaked ones. 

About one-fifth of those reporting on 
preparation of dried beans and peas par- 
boiled them. Some parboiled rather 
than soaked, though several reported both 
practices. Valuable nutrients are lost in 
parboiling. , 

Only a few homemakers reported using 
soaking water in cooking. Masters found 
that discarding the soaking water gave 
no greater loss than when the beans were 
cooked in water in which soaked.—/ 

Dried legumes were usually started in 
cold water with a piece of raw salt pork. 
As stated before, starting in cold water 
lengthens cooking time and increases 
cooking losses. More than half of those 
interviewed reported adding salt after 
beans or peas were tender. This prac- 
tice is contrary to recommendations of 
food and nutrition specialists. 

Adding soda during cooking was un- 
common (only 6 percent reported its 
use). Soda added to the cooking water 
is likely to make the beans mushy on the 
outside, while the center is still hard. 
Addition of soda to the soaking water i^ 
preferrable to the addition of soda to 
the cooking water. Addition of soda is 
undesirable at any time, if the vegetable 
is overcooked or if used in excess. 

Dried legumes require a longer cooking 
period than do fresh legumes. The time 
it takes to get tender differs somewhat 
with variety. "Good cooking" varieties 
of field peas and butter beans should get 
tender in a boiling period of one hour, 
provided the legumes have been soften- 
ed by soaking. As will be noted, median 
time from putting on to cook and serv-

ing was, for dried butter beacis, 2 hours; 
for dried field peas, 214 hours (table 8). 
One factor in longer cooking may have 
been failure to soak sufficiently before 
cooking. Long cooking periods increase 
loss of nutrients. Intervals between put- 
ting on the stove and completing cook- 
ing, between completing cooking and 
serving, between putting on the stove 
and serving, were greater for Negro than 
for white women. 

Pot hquor from dry peas and beans 
was almost always consumed by family 
members. 

Frozen Vegetables 

About two-thirds of those reporting 
on preparation of frozen vegetables gave 
information on vegetables which they 
had put in the community freezer lock- 
er plant. Vegetables sent to the plant 
except field peas were usually harvested 
the morning of the day carried to the 
locker plant. Field peas were generally 
harvested the afternoon before. Vege- 
tables were as a rule prepared for blanch- 
ing in the morning, or morning and aft- 
ernoon. Blanching and packing were re- 
ported as done at home for three-fourths 
of the vegetables. In the remainder it 
was done at the locker plant. About 
one-half reported that vegetables were 
taken to the locker in the morning; the 
other half that they were taken in the 
afternoon. One should aim at a max- 
imum time of two hours from garden 
to freezer (and try to make it less), since 
a short interval means better vegetables. 
Preparing vegetables for freezing is often 
quite time consuming, and too large an 
amount should not be prepared on any 
one day. It is desirable to do the blanch- 
ing and packing of vegetables at home, 
unless there is sufficient assistance at 
the locker plant to take care of the vege- 
table soon after it is brought to the 
locker. 

In 25 of the 37 reports on frozen vege- 
tables, they were put on the range to cook 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES IN SMALL TOWN*FAMILIES IN MISSISSIPPI 31 



frozen. Two reported partly thawing 
and nine completely thawing. In one 
report it was stated that no set procedure 
was followed. It is unnecessary and un- 
desirable to thaw most frozen vegetables 
prior to cooking. If they are thawed 
completely, they lose a high percent of 
the vitamin C and some flavor. How- 
ever, corn on the cob must be thawed, 
or the cob may still be frozen when 
kernels are cooked. 

Starting the frozen vegetable to cook 
in a little cold water was the usual prac- 
tice. The recommended procedure is 
to put a small amount of lightly salted 
water in the sauce pan to K cup 
of liquid is enough). Bring the liquid 
to boil, add frozen vegetable, and when 
boiling starts again, cover the pan tight- 
ly. After 2 or 3 minutes, break the melt- 
ing mass of food apart with a fork so 
the heat will reach all parts evenly, then 
cover ^gain. 

Frozen vegetables were seasoned very 
much as were fresh vegetables, except 
butter or oleo was more frequently used 
in seasoning butter beans and English 
peas than in seasoning these two vege- 
tables when fresh. 

Practices such as parboiling and addi- 
tion of soda were not reported in cook- 
ing frozen vegetables. 

Median time from putting frozen vege- 
tables on the range to serving was about 
half the time used for the fresh vege- 
table. Cooking time for frozen vege- 
tables is just about half that for fresh 
vegetables. It is less since frozen vege- 
tables have been partially cooked in the 
blanching process and since freezing soft- 
ens the tissues still further. Cooking 
and/or holding periods for fresh vege- 
tables were for the majority of families 
excessive. Therefore, cooking and/or 
holding periods for frozen vegetables were 
for the majority of families excessive. 

Raw Vegetable Dishes 

In preparing cabbage for slaw, two- 
thirds of those reporting said they cut 



the cabbage with a knife. Fourteen per- 
cent grated the cabbage and 3 percent 
ground it in a meat chopper. The re- 
mainder (about 16 percent) shredded it 
in a shredder. Grating, grinding, shred- 
ding in a shredder are destructive of vi- 
tamin C. Cabbage for slaw should be 
cut with a sharp knife. 

Soaking vegetables in cool water be- 
fore making into salad was no more 
common than was soaking leafy vege- 
tables to be boiled. 

For the majority, there was a short 
interval between completing preparation 
and serving; for a few quite a long in- 
terval. About one-half of those report- 
ing on sliced tomatoes and one-fourth 
on cole slaw stated that the salad was 
placed on the dining table when prepara- 
tion was complete. Losses would be 
greater if stored on the table rather than 
in the refrigerator. 

Storage From One Meal 
to the Next 

Forty-nine percent of the cooked vege- 
table dishes for which records were kept 
were served at another meal, usually at 
supper. In the interval, a little more 
than one-half (54 percent) of the vege- 
tables were stored in the refrigerator, 
about one-fourth on the dining table or 
in a cabinet, and the remainder in the 
oven, the warming: oven, or on the top 
of the stove. In 11 percent of the to- 
mato records, 45 percent of the cole slaw 
records, and 30 percent of the other 
mixed vegetables salad records, there were 
left-overs for the next meal. These salads 
were in all cases kept in the refrigerator 
in the interval between the two meals 
in which served. Losses in nutrients are 
less when refrigerator storage is used. 

SUMMARY 

This studv reports methods used in 
preparation of 9,246 vegetable dishes by 
844 families in six small towns of Mis- 
sissippi.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 449 



Two methods of securing the informa- 
tion were used: (1) The record method, 
whereby detailed day-by-day records of 
steps in preparation of particular vege- 
tables served during the report week were 
kept by 80 white and 80 Negro home- 
makers. (2) The schedule method, 
whereby 440 white and 244 Negro home- 
makers were interviewed with the use 
of schedules concerning preparation of 
vegetables. 

Great variation was found in prepara- 
tion practices used by different families. 
In no one step in preparation did all 
homemakers report good practices (prac- 
tices recommended by food and nutri- 
tion specialists), nor did all homemakers 
report poor practices. However, in some 
steps in preparation, the majority used 
good practices; in other steps in prepara- 
tion, the majority used poor practices. 

Good preparation practices reported by 
the majority were: 

(1) Discarding stems and stripping old 
and tough midribs of leafy vegetables. 

(2) Starting leafy vegetables in boiUng 
water. 

(3) Cooking vegetables with lid on. 

(4) Shelling peas and beans shortly 
before cooking. 

(5) Using baking as the principal 
method of preparing sweet potatoes. 

(6) Blanching and packing vegetables 
to be frozen, at home rather than taking 
to locker plant where facilities for prompt 
handling are not usually available, 

(7) Starting frozen vegetables to cook 
frozen. 

(8) Cutting cabbage for slaw or salad 
with a knife rather than grating, grind- 
ing, shredding in shredder. 

(9) Preparing raw vegetable dishes 
just before using, or if ahead, placing in 
the refrigerator during the interval. 

(10) Consuming vegetable pot liquor. 

(11) Storing left-over cooked and raw 
vegetable prepared dishes in the refrig- 
erator. 



Poor preparation practices reported by 
the majority were: 

(1) Not adding salt to the vegetable 
until tender. 

(2) Excessive cooking of vegetables — 
cooking longer than is needed to be ten- 
der. 

(3) Keeping vegetables warm for a 
period before serving after* sufficiently 
cooked. 

(4) Starting legumes, roots, and tubers 
to cook in cold water. 

(5) Little use of baking as a method of 
preparing Irish potatoes. 

(6) Not making use of water drained 
from vegetables before seasoning, espe- 
cially canning liquid. 

(7) Parboiling new Irish potatoes. 

(8) Canning tomatoes by methods oth- 
er than water bath method. Canning 
other vegetables by methods other than 
steam pressure canner. 

(9) N'o soaking or inadequate soaking 
of dry legumes. 

(10) Too great an interval between 
harvesting vegetables for freezing and 
putting in quick freezer. 

Negro homemakers reported more poor 
practices in preparation of vegetables 
than did white homemakers. Greater 
number of poor practices in the Negro 
family is particularly serious, since Negro 
families usually have low incomes. Low- 
income families are more likely to have 
an inadequate supply of food than are 
higher-income families. 

The traditional preparation rule con- 
cerning parboiling new vegetables (the 
first "mess" or "messes" of a vegetable 
harvested) was not being followed to any 
extent except in preparation of new Irish 
potatoes. 

Preparation practices seem associated. 
For example, those who cook collard 
greens excessively are more likely to add 
soda during cooking.

Improving Vegetable Preparation 



One likes what one is used to. Since 
this is true, family members may like 
vegetables cooked by methods using poor 
practices. Evidence that they did is that 
only 50 persons were reported as not eat- 
ing the cooked vegetable dishes; only 7 
as not eating the raw vegetable dishes for 
which records were kept. 

Herein is a real challenge to the home- 
maker: To teach members of her family 
to like vegetables prepared according to 
good practices. To do this job effec- 
tively may mean first of all learning her- 
self to like vegetables prepared by good 
practices. If the homemaker does not 
like vegetables prepared according to good 
practices, family members usually know 
it. Teaching members of the family to 
like well prepared vegetables will cer- 
tainly mean knowing what good prepara- 
tion practices are. Good practices are 
not the same today as they were yester- 
day. They depend on research findings 
and developments in processing. If one 
is using vegetable preparation rules learn- 
ed when a child, one is not using prac- 
tices recommended by food and/or nu- 
trition specialists. 

Some pointers for Improving vegetable 
preparation: 

(1) In cooking mixtures with vege- 
tables, start with the ingredient requir- 
ing most cooking and add later ingred- 
ients requiring less cooking. (For ex- 
ample, in preparing vegetable soup with 
fresh vegetables, start with soup bone. 
Boil it until practically tender, add but- 
ter beans and other vegetables requiring 
20 to 30 minutes boiling, add tomatoes 
about 10 minutes before serving.) 

(2) Avoid the use of tough vegetables. 
Follow rules of successive planting. 



(3) In preparing vegetables not before 
served to the family, be sure to use good 
preparation practices. Establish good 
habits for new vegetables. 

(4) Watch storage between completing 
cooking and serving. If, because of 
other duties, vegetables must be prepared 
ahead, slightly undercook, if storage pe- 
riod is to be short; complete cooking, cool 
quickly, put in the refrigerator, and heat 
just before serving, if storage period is 
to be long. 

(5) If in the habit of excessive cooking 
of vegetables, gradually reduce cooking 
time. Family members are less likely to 
notice changes when gradually made. 

(6) If accustomed to excessive cooking 
of vegetable with salt pork, reduction in 
cooking time will be 'loticed less if sea- 
soning is chancjedj as there may be ^an 
association in flavors from long cooking 
and seasoning. For example, if turnips 
have been excessively cooked with salt 
pork, try the following method: Peel, 
slice, boil quickly in a little salted water, 
drain (the little cooking water is delicious 
in vegetable soup), add a Httle milk, oleo 
or butter, and black pepper. Heat and 
serve. 

(7) Recommendations of food and nu- 
trition specialists concerning preparation 
of vegetable change as research findings 
and developments in processing are made 
available. Homemakers must keep up- 
to-date in vegetable cookery, if they want 
to use good practices. This means join- 
ing clubs, attending demonstrations where 
such information is given, reading, con- 
sulting one's home demonstration agent, 
home economics teachei or Farmers 
Home Administration home supervisor. 
Old cook books or methods learned when 
a child cannot be relied upon.
