COMPILED ESPECIALLY POR THEM BY 

Miss FANNIE MERRITT FARMER, 

PRINCIPAL BOSTON COOKING SCHOOL. 



We published last year (1897) a series of menus which we found 
were greatly appreciated. 

We have published herein an entirely new and second series, 
which, if tried, will be found valuable, useful, practical, and economical. 

If it has troubled you to know what to get for meals, keep our 
Cook and Menu Books, and they will save you lots of trouble.

f 

In ordering goods by express or mail, please 

note the following instructions, to save 
delay : 

Write name and address plainly, specifying 
what express, if any, is preferred. 

Send money enough to fully pay charges 
and mailing, and if too much is received we 
will return balance in package. 

Send money by registered letter, or P. O. 
or Express money order. Unless so sent we 
will not be responsible. 

Preparations of our own manufacture sent 
C. O. D. Twenty-five cents will be charged 
for packing all goods other than our own 
preparations, but no charge will be made if 
the purchaser buys an original package or 
quantity as we receive it from manufacturers. 

When necessary to remit coin in small 
amounts, cut opening in cardboard exact size of 
piece of money sent, and fasten it firmly by 
passing strong pieces of paper over each side 
of coin, securing ends of paper with mucilage. 



OUR ENORMOUS BUSINESS INSURES YOU FRESH GOODS. 



We oftentimes recommend our own piviia.aujiis lu our customers, because we are interested to please 
and suit tlieni: 

Well knowing that by pleasinf? them we will merit a continuance of tlieir patronage. 

Oftentimes a customer is after a cure, and •' in our experience," many times when he has tried variously 
advertised preparations without benefit he asks for some preparation, knowing nothing of its value simply 
because he has heard of that one, or seen it advertised. ' 

Now, all things considered : 

Why shouldn't a customer take a prepaiation that is Ruaranteed to cure— (in case it proves unsatis 
factory the purchase money will be refunded)— rather than an experiment f 

You'll always find our prices as low as the lowest, and our quality the best. 

We never allow ourselves to be undersold. We often reduce prices, but 
never mark them up. 



WE are the ONLY Drug- 
gists in New England 
who Manufacture 
their 
OWN PREPARATIONS 

in their 

OWN LABORATORY

We are the largest Retail Drug-gists in New England. 

We manufacture all our own preparations in our own laboratory, which 
covers nearly 1-4 of an aCre of floor space, and is under the 
immediate supervision of a skilled chemist, and none but men of long expe- 
rience are employed. 

We buy the very best goods obtainable. 

We were the first and are still the only retail druggists who can guarantee 
their own preparations, and they are guaranteed because we know their 
superiority. 

Our salesmen are all experienced men, and can give you a great deal of 
valuable information. 

We guarantee everything we sell to be exactly aS represented,

IF YOU Want the Best Insect Powder there is^^ 
in the United States, use 

JAYNES' MAGIC INSECT POWDER, 

which will KILL and is Guaranteed to Kill, 
or Money Refunded. 

DON'T EXPERIMENT with cheap Insect Powder because the price 

is a trifle lower. 

Don't fill your rooms with worthless powder only to find that it 
DOES NOT KILL the bugs. 

il^^We are the only flrm in the United States who import the materials 
used in the manufacture of this lusect Powder, and 

ITS EQUAL CANNOT BE FOUND IN THIS COUNTRY. 

ir»"There is NO POWDER, PASTE or LIQUID that will so quickly rid 
your house of WATER BUGS, ROACHES, and all Insect Pests, as JAYNES' 
MAGIC INSECT POWDER. 

i8^-Dou't confound THIS POWDER with Dalmatian and other Powders 
asually sold ; it is entirely different. 

j!^"It will KILL where others simply stupefy or driye them away for the 
time hein^. 

JAYNES' MAGIC INSECT POWDER 

will not drire the Bugs from one apartment to another, or from one part of the 
building to another, but driyes them out and KILLS them. 

^^"Take home a box and try it, and if it does not KILL the Bugs we will 
refund the money. No one else has the confidence to do this. 

jT^-JAYNES' MAGIC INSECT POWDER is put up only in Tin Cans, 
which preycnts losing its strength, and is always in condition to use. It should 
only be used in a Bellows, as the Dust KILLS the Bugs — they do not eat it — 
and if used in this way WE WARRANT IT TO KILL, OR REFUND THE 
MONEY. 

I^^If you haye been disgnsted by using Insect Powders that were not satis^ 
&ctory, try 

JAYNES' MAGIC INSECT POWDER, 

and if it does not do the work we will REFUND THE MONEY. 

I^^-JAYNES' MAGIC INSECT POWDER is put up in four sizes, and wiU 
be sent by express upon receipt of price, or by mail on receipt of price and 
postage.

JAYNES' 

CASTORMELS 



A Pleasant Laxative Confection. 



Xjacfa Oastormel contains one teaspoonful of pure Castor Oil, compounded with other 
ingredients, and flavored to make it a delightful confection. 

It has been acknowledged for centuries past by the most eminent authorities in 
Medical Science, that Oleum Kiiini, Castor Oil, is the most thorough cathartic that can 
be used by the 

AGED OR YOUNG IN ALL CASES. 

The only reason that Castor Oil is not one of the most extensively used of medi- 
cines is on account of its nauseating and disagreeable taste. • 

Pills and Capsules have been offered containing Castor Oil, and professing to 
contain the active principle; but they all failed to do the work as satisfactorily as the 
clear oil. 

The CASTORMELS will Immediately relieve and eventually cure the most 

obstinate and chronic cases of Biliousness, Constipation, Headache, 

Lassitude, and all troubles arisingr from a sluggish condition 

of the bowels and torpid liver. 

The use of one CASTORMEL a day will regulate the bowels. 

If for a physic more should be taken. It is a HousEHOLn Remedy that is indis- 
pensable. DIRECTIONS ON THE BOX. 

PRICE, 23 CENTS PER BOX. 



JAYNES' PILLS ^ ^ 

^ ^ FOR KIDNEY ILLS 

Are a Certain Cure for ALL DISEASES of the KIDNEYS. 

It is a well-known fact that the minor Kidney diseases, if not attended to, run into 
Bright's Disease, the first symptoms of which can hardly be distinguished from those 
of other diseases. One of the most common sy'mptoms.of Kidney Disease is a deranged 
stomach ; it is also manifested by Headache, Pain in the Back, etc.; the water is thick 
and discolored with a heavy red sediment, like brick dust, deposited on the bottom of 
the vessel, and a scum or crust on top. 

All remedies should by their action assist the weak parts to throw off the secre- 
tions, which impair the healthy action of the organs and produce disease. This remedy 
will do that, and gradually, by no violent action, restore you to perfect health. 

These Pills will cure 

Inflammation of the Kidneys, Congestion of the Kidneys, 

Rheumatism of the Kidneys, Diseases of the Bladder, 

Sallow Complexion (when due to Inactive Kidneys), 

Dizziness, Neuralgia, Headache, and Impure Blood (when due to Diseased 

Kidneys). 

If you are troubled with any of these symptoms, do not wait until the organs are 
so weak and depleted that recovery is impossible, but at once use a box of Jaynes' 
Kidney Pills, and if relief is not afforded, we will refund the money, in every case 
where the directions are followed, if not satisfactory. 

PRICE. 33 CENTS PER BOX OF 100 PILLS. 

Double the quantity for the money of any i.thtr Ki.lney Pills sold.

JAYNES' BALSAM OV TAR 

HAS ATTAINED 

The Largest Sale of Any Cough Remedy 

before the public, and this e^itirely on its merits, never having been advertised, but sold 
by the recommendations of parties who have used it. As a remedy for 

Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Hoarseness and Asthma it is Linequailed. 

Regular Size, 50 Cents. Large Size, Three Times the Quantity, $1.00. 

It is acknowledged by the Leading Physicians to be a safe and reliable 
remedy for all Pulmonary Diseases. 

WHAT IS A COLD? 

Symptoms : At first commonly sneezing, pain in the forehead, difficult breathing 
through the nose, which may develop into Influenza or La Grippe, as in the years 183* 
and 1889-90, as water running from the nose and eyes and a slight discharge from the 
mouth and nose, gradually increasing until expectoration becomes thick and yellow, 
aching back, thirst and loss of appetite, chills followed by flashes of heat, and if neg- 
lected it leads to many serious troubles, as emaciation, loss of energy, chronic cough, 
pneumorfia and consumption. 

CURE THE COLD AND PREVENT THIS. 

Treatment: In mild cases, soak the feet in warm water ; keep warm and awa> 
from a draft ; and if more serious, place the patient in bed, putting bottles of hot wate? 
to the feet and sides. The patient 
should not venture into the open air 
until the unpleasant sense of chilli- 
ness, peculiar to the disease, ceases 
to be produced by exposure. In the 
meantime, use Jaynes' Balsam of Tar, 
carefully following directions, and if 
it does not cure you we will refund 
your money. 

IT IS GUARANTEED TO CURE 

Or We Will Refund the Money. 



TESTI3IONIALS. 

Messrs. JAYNES & CO. 

Last Spring while visiting; in Boston a friend 
pave me a sample bottle of your Balsam of 
Tar, lvno\vin« tliat I was a great sufferer from 
chronic Bronchitis for ovei- five years. After 
coming home I tried the sample and it seemed 
to relieve me at once. Sueh relief from a 
sample bottle led nie to try it further. I sent 
by express to Boston for a large bottle. I 
have used it, and I have not been so well as I 
am now any time during the past five years. 

I think your medicine ought to be sold all 
over the country. Yours, 

P. S. SHAW, So. Berwick, Maine. 
Mrs. C. A. RICHARDSON, 94 Lexington St., E. 
Boston, says : 

I highly recommend Jaynes' Balsam of Tar 
for coughs, colds, etc. I have u<ed it myself 
and recommend it to others. Have also sent 
it to my brother who is in Maine, and it has 
cured him of a severe cold. Am perfectly 
willing to be interviewed on the subject, and 
can say that Jaynes' Balsam of Tar cannot be 
too highly recommended.

Mkssrs.: I liave been a long and awful sufferer from Indigestion and sick Headache; would V)e taken 
suddenly with dizziness and be obliged to grasp something for support or sit down until it had passed 
away. When the dizziness left nie, then came the awful Headache and sick stomach. Have had 
doctor after doctor and no cure; advertised remedies I tried until I was discouraged. I always found the 
money in the advertising instead of in the medicine. 

I used two boxes of your Dyspepsia Tablets and found relief from the first, and I can now say lam 
completely cured, and want everyone to know that there is a remedy for the worst case of Dyspepsia,^ 
that will cure. Yours tridy, 

Mrs. ANNIE BOSSEY, 17 Davis St.. Linden, Mass. 

Mr. JOHN BUTLER. 11 Agrocola St., Halifax, says : 

Have not been able to eat only just such food for years, and then was greatly troubled with indiges- 
tion. Have tried doctors luUll I was disgusted ; taken patent medicine by the dozen bottles without 
relief. I was advised to try Jaynes' Dyspepsia Tablets by some one whom they had benefited. I bought 
a box. They helped me. I have used now six boxes, and can say they liave cured me. 

Miss MAY ELLSWORTH, 194 Harrison Ave., Boston, says : 

Have tried a great many different kinds of Dyspepsia cures (so-called), and have never received any 
benefit until I took Jaynes' Dyspepsia Tablets.

JAYNES & CO., Boston: 

It may be of some good to you, as well as to some of your manv patrons, to know of the good you are 
doing with the medicines yon compound in yonr own Laboratory. I have had snch good results from the 
use of O.vE Bottle of J.VYNES' SARSAPARILL.A, with loninic of Potassium, that I want to write and 
tell you about it : I have for a long time been troubled with Scrofulous Swelling of the Cilands of the Neck 
and under the Arms, at times very painful and always disfiguring. One bottle of Jaynes' Sarsaparilla, 
COMBINED WITH loDiDE OF PoTAS«iuM. very nearly removed them in both places. 

Yours respectfully, E. BRISSON, 53 Caruoll St., Chelsea, Mass. 

Mrs. COLBATH, of 1.59 Bridge Street. East Cambridge, says that .Tavnes' Sarsaparilla has done her a 

frreat service in eradicating blood-poisoning which she accidentally contracted in her foot. She was suflfer- 
ng greatly when her husband brought home a bottle of the Sarsaparilla. and was very much pleased to 
find after taking it for a day or two that the painful symptoms were subsiding. As she 'persisted in its use 
■he found that her general health became very much improved and all traces of the blood-poisoning 
disappeared. She has taken four bottles in all, and is now in perfect health and spirits.

I am a painter by trade, and about a year ago was compelled to give up mj- work on account ot 
rheumatism. I went to the hospital, and paid out over ?600 to doctors, but did not pet any better. My wife 
went into your store one evening and boufjht me a larpe bottle of your Blood and Nerve Tonic I wa« 
induced by her (much against my will) to try It. It helped me from the very first, and before I had finished 
the bottle I was entirely cured. I consider it also a wonderful remedy as a Nerve Tonic. Have recom- 
mended it to a great many people

A sure and instant relief for the attacks of Spasmodic Asthma. Many bad cases

RELIEF WARRANTED OR YOUR MONEY REFUNDED 
Price, 35 and 60 cents. 



F. H. THAYER, Cor. Union & Middle Sts., E. Braintree, Mass., says : 

I take pleasure in recommendiBg Jaynes' Asthma Cure. My mother, Mrs. Delia Thayer, a lady eighty- 
one years old, has been troubled for a long time with asthma so bad that she could not rest nights. 
Having tried a great many so-called Asthma Cures was induced finally to use yours. Two boxes and a 
half cured her, and she has had one-half box in the house for a long time but has not had to use it. 

Mr. N. E. YOUNG, Cohasset, Mass., says : 

I have. been troubled with Asthma since boyhood, developing from a case of Phthisis. After trying 
all manner of cures, besides travelling to California, also the Sandwich Islands, with no permanent benefit, 
I tried Jaynes' Astbma cure, and am now completely rid of the trouble and use nothing whatever. 



You wear a 



TRUSS 



And when you were fitted to it you had to pay A HIGH PRICE. Don't do it again. 

When you renew the old one, come and get our prices and be fitted to a good trass at 
a reasonable price. 

OUR 




Department 



We make a specialty of the mechanical treatment of Rupture. Our truss depart- 
ment is one of the most complete in New England, and is in charge of persons who have 
made rupture and its treatment a study for years, and who are thoroughly conpeient in the 
fitting of trusses. We guarantee perfect satisfaction, and will refund the money in case 
we are not successful in perfectly holding the rupture with ease and comfort to the 
patient. Our prices are from 33 per cent to so per cent less than are cofn^nonly asked. 

If you are a sufferer from this most unfortunate aflSiction, you will surely profit by 
i consultation with our sjpecialists in this department. 

HERNIA (Rupture). ITS TREATMENT. 

Hernia is the protrusion of any viscus from its normal cavity. The form of hernia 
i;o which we wish to call attention is that most commonly known, when a part of the 
contents of the abdominal cavity protrudes through some weak part in the abdominal 
wall. The common situations are the groin (inguinal hernia), upper part of the thigh 
(femoral hernia), and the umbilicus or naval (umbilical hernia). The exciting cause of 
hernia is_ generally some strain or overexertion in any powerful effort, as lifting a 
heavy weight, or in consequence of constipation or excessive coughing. A person 
aflSicted with hernia should not neglect proper treatment for a day- The best authori- 
ties agree that the most rational and successful treatment is a properly fitted truss. 

Our truss department is most complete. Our specialists in charge have had years 
of experience, and are exceptionally competent to attend to this branch of our business. 
We have made a radical reform in the prices for trusses and their application, and we 
can save you from 33 to 50 per cent from prices usually asked, and guarantee perfect 
satisfaction. 



Remember we are the lowest priced Druggists in New England.

TESTIIVIONIALS. 

ftlr. THOMAS PUNCHARD, 5 Keiffer Court, Brooklink, Mass., says . 

Two years ago I was troubled by a slight, persistent cough that quickly developed to & rery bao 
sne. It settled upon my lungs, caused loss of appetite, and so wrecked my nervous force I could no 
obtain restful sleep. A friend advised the use of liydrolitie. I used it until a nightmare of empty bottles 
collected about the house ; nearly two years had elapsed and my health as had as its yorst. At the time 
I came to your store for another buttle a clerk advised that I try your EMULSIOIv'', and I relucl»ntly 
took one bottle of it. 

TflAT ONE BOTTLE HAS CURED ME. 
It h«8 ;done what a two years' treatment of advertised remedies could not do. I cannot praise it toe 
highly. 

Mr. P. R. ANDREWS, of 37 A Streict, Boston, says : 

I liad a very severe ci^ld on my hings, and I couldn't find anything to help me until r.ne day 
i was recommended to try a bottle of Jaynes' Kmulsion of Cod Liver Oil, and upon using one bottle I felt 
greatly relieved, and was very much surprised, upon weighing myself, to find that I had gained ten 
poimds, and I cheerfully recoinnientl it to any one who is suffering with lung trouble. 

Messrs. JAYNES & Co., Boston, Mass.

W. C. ANDREWS, De Leon Springs, Fla. 
THOS. RYAN, 2.3 Merriam St., Somerville, Mass., says :
