PREFACE 

The plan in this little book has been to give a simple 
basis for the pupil to work from, leaving the teacher 
free to present the lesson in her own way. The princi- 
pal points to be brought out are suggested by the 
questions at the end of each lesson. These questions 
are to be answered by the pupil in the spare moments 
which are so often wasted in the course of an ordinary 
cookery period. 

This course may be completed in one school year, 
or in two, according to the frequency of the lessons. 
The book is divided into two parts for the convenience 
of classes which devote two years to the subject. 



PART I 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME 
ECONOMICS 

SUGGESTIONS FOR HOUSEKEEPING 

Let each pupil provide herself with two large, plain, 
white aprons made from cambric, long cloth, or linen; 
avoid lawn because it wears so short a time and rumples 
so easily. In addition to the aprons, every girl should 
have her own small hand-towel and cookery holder; the 
towel need not be more than eighteen inches long, and 
the holder should not be over five inches square. 

When working in the cookery room, keep the wrists 
free from bracelets and the fingers free from rings; let 
the hair be neat and away from the face. 

Before beginning the lesson see that the hands are 
thoroughly washed and the nails well cleaned. Keep 
the hand-towel fastened at the waist, ready for imme- 
diate use. 

When the lesson is over, fold both apron and towel 
neatly and place in the locker assigned. Before leav- 
ing the class-room be siu-e that all utensils are in perfect 
order and, if possible, that yoiu- notes are all placed in 
yoiu- text-book. 



4 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Dish-Washing 

Clean all plates and dishes; if they are greasy, use 
brown paper; if not, scrape with a rubber scraper or 
with a case-knife. 

Arrange neatly and in the most convenient manner. 
Use hot, soapy water, filling the dishpan about one- 
third full. Change the water frequently if many dishes 
are to be washed. Rinse all dishes with clear, hot 
water and wipe with clean towels free from lint. 

Wash glassware first. If an extra polish is desired, 
wipe from the soapy water. 

After the glassware, wash the silver, then the china, 
and then the cooking utensils. 

Take fresh, hot water and wash the towels thor- 
oughly, rinse in clear water, stretch carefully and hang 
to dry; fold the dishcloth evenly and hang to dry. 

Be very careful to keep bone, ivory, or wooden handles 
of knives or forks out of the water, and make sure, 
when washing a Dover egg-beater, that only the part 
below the wheel touches the water. 

If a saucepan has become burned place a few tea- 
spoons of baking soda in the pan, fill with warm water 
and let it stand for several hours or over night.

Turn the gas on freely before lighting. 

Keep the blaze free from yellow flame and as low 
as is allowable with the heat required. 

In lighting the oven be sure that there is no free gas 
to cause an explosion. (Usually it is wiser to open the 
oven door before lighting.)

10 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

FOOD 

The food which we eat may be divided into three 
distinct classes: proteins, carbohydrates, fats. These 
will be studied in detail as we advance in the work. 
Try to remember now that protein foods are the chief 
sources of tissue and muscle, and that the carbohydrates 
and fats give us energy and fat. 

MILK 

The first food that children take is milk, and for the 
young child this seems an almost perfect food. Since 
all young children must live on it, it is necessary for 
us to know how to tell good milk and how to care for 
it. It is very difiicult to get fresh, pure milk in the 
large cities, and nothing that comes into the house 
requires more care. 

Care of Milk 

Select the best dairy you can find. Wipe milk bottles 
when brought into the house. Place in -refrigerator or 
cold closet,. If turned from bottles, place in glass, ag'ate- 
ware, earthenware, granite, or aluminmn, and keep 
covered. If doubtful about the purity, scald. To 
scald the milk, heat over hot water; when a bead-like 
ring forms around the edge, it is scalded. Remove 
directly. Greater heat makes the milk less digestible.

HOUSEKEEPING 
Care of Refrigerator 

Look over the refrigerator daily to see that no food 
is left to spoil. Food with a strong flavor, or hot food, 
should not be put into the refrigerator. 

Once a week every part of the refrigerator should be 
washed with a solution of washing-soda, a dish mop 
being used. Rinse, wipe as dry as possible, and air 
thoroughly before using again. Flush the waste-pipe 
with the soda solution. 

Care of the Sink 

Always pour dishwater through a sink strainer, and 
put the refuse left in strainer in garbage pail. 

When dish-washing is finished, wash every part of 
the sink and sink strainer with hot, soapy water. Wash 
above and around the sink, and use a scrubbing brush 
and a skewer when necessary. 

Flush the sink with boiling water every day, and 
about once a week with a strong, hot solution of washing- 
soda. (Cover 1 c. washing-soda with 6 qts. boiling 
water and let remain on the fire until all the soda is 
dissolved. Pour this, boiling hot, into the pipes, using 
2 to 3 qts. for each sink.) 

Garbage 

Garbage should be burned, or should be put into 
large pails to be collected several times a week. These 



18 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

garbage pails should be cleaned thoroughly with the 
hose, after emptying, and dried well in the sun. When 
necessary, a strong, hot solution of washing-soda should 
be used to clean them. 

Scraps in the kitchen should be put into a granite- 
ware pail. This scrap pail should be emptied into the 
garbage pail every day. It should be washed as any 
other dish and thoroughly dried. Once a week it should 
be washed with the soda solution. 

Care of the Range 

When grease or other material is spilled on the range 
while cooking is being done, rub off at once with paper. 

Beside cleaning out the ashes from the range every 
day, the space above and below the oven should be 
cleaned out about once a month, as the soot and ashes 
collected there prevent the proper heating of the oven. 

Never blacken the range without cleaning it first. 
Moisten some stove poHsh with cold water and rub it 
over the range with a brush or cloth. Blacken when 
stove is cold. 

Use a dry brush for pohshing, rubbing very brisklysk 
Begin at front of range when the stove is warm. 

To Clean Metals 

Always wash articles carefully before cleaning. After 
cleaning, wash in hot water containing ammonia, and 
dry carefully. The following cleansing agents may be 
used: 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 19 

Tin. â€” Sapolio or silver-polish; whiting, moistened 
with ammonia, alcohol, or water. 

Steel Knives. â€” Brick or Sapolio.

and fold in lightly the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff, 
and the grated pineapple. . Serve cold with cream. 



To what class of foods does cornstarch belong? 
What is its special use in the body? 

CEREALS 

The most important cereal food products are those 
prepared from wheat, corn, rice, and oats. 

Composition 

"Cereals contain all the food principles; they aver- 
age about two-thirds carbohydrates, one-tenth protein, 
one-tenth water, and they contain a httle fat and min- 
eral matter." 



22 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Their chief value, however, lies in their starch com- 
position, and because of this they require thorough 
cooking. 



Rules for Cooking 

Allow 3^ tsp. salt to 1 c. boiling water. 
Allow 1 c. rolled cereal to 2 c. boiling water. 
Allow 1 c. coarse cereal to 3 c. boiling water. 
Allow 1 c. fine cereal to 4 c. boiling water. 

Add salt to water and stir in cereal with a fork. Cook 
directly over the fire for five minutes, stirring constantly, 
then place in double boiler or fireless cooker. 

Cook the coarse grains 7 or 8 h. 

Cook the rolled grains in double boiler 45 or 60 m. 

Cook the fine grains in double boiler 30 or 45 m. 



Gruels 

In many cases of sickness the patient is unable to 
take any soHd food, and a gruel is prescribed by the 
physician. This is nothing but a cereal cooked with a 
much larger proportion of water; usually we use one 
tablespoonful of the cereal to one cup of water or milk, 
and cook very thoroughly. The gruel is then strained, 
seasoned with salt, and served very hot. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 25 

Indian Meal Gruel

Blend meal with a little cold water and stir into boil- 
ing water. Boil gently 2 hrs. Salt to taste. Sweeten if 
necessary, and add milk if desired. Strain, and serve 
hot. 

Flour Gruel 

1 c. milk. Spk. salt. 

1 tbsp. flour. 1 doz. raisins. 

Stone and quarter raisins, then add water to cover 
them; cook slowly until water has all boiled away. 
Add to gruel just before serving. 

Gruel : Mix the flour with a little cold milk and stir 
into scalded milk. Cook in a double boiler 3^ h., first 
boiling well over the fire. Add salt and raisins; strain 
and serve. 

Note. â€” Do not use the raisins if the patient has 
bowel trouble. 

Oatmeal Gruel 

2 tbsp. rolled oats.

RICE 

Rice contains more starch and less fat than any 
other grain. It is a good food for people in tropical 
countries and is very easily digested. It should be 
combined with eggs, milk, or meat. 

Boiled Rice 

3 qts. boiling water. 
1 c. well washed rice. 
1 tbsp. salt. 



A HANDBOOK OP HOME ECONOMICS 25 

To wash rice well, put into a strainer and set in a 
deep dish of cold water. Rub the rice, and lift the 
strainer in and out of the water, changing the water 
until it is clear. 

Drain, drop the rice into the boiling water slowly, 
and lift up grains of rice from bottom of pan with a 
fork until the water is boiling rapidly again. Cook 20 
m. to J^ h., or until soft, and add the salt when nearly 
done. 

' Drain in the strainer and dry in an open oven, or 
leave in stewpan, cover with napkin, and set back on 
stove to steam and become dry. 

Save water in which the rice is boiled and use for 
soup, gravy, or rice pudding. 

Molded Rice 

1 c. well washed rice. 

2 c. hot milk. 

1 c. boiling water. 
1 tsp. salt. 

Scald milk in a double boiler, add rice, boiling water 
and salt, cover and let cook 45 m., or until kernels are 
soft. When cooked, uncover, that the steam may 
escape. (More water and less milk may be used.) 

Place a layer of rice in cup. 

Add layer of prepared dates, another layer of rice. 
Press firmly together. Turn from cups and serve with 
sugar and cream or milk.

removed first, then food, then clean dishes, then 
crumbs. 

When folding the tablecloth or napkins always fold 
very carefully in the same creases. 



PART II 



EGGS 

Eggs are a tissue-building food, the chief protein 
being a form of albumen. In food value and in digesti- 
bility they compare favorably with meat, and during 
the spring and summer should be freely used. 

When an egg is perfectly fresh it will sink to the 
bottom of a brine made in the proportion of two ounces 
of salt to one pint of water; if stale, the egg will float 
upon the surface. If a stale egg is shaken gently it will 
give a rattling sound. 

Soft-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 6 to 8 m. 

Hard-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 40 to 45 m. 

[ Poached Eggs on Toast 

Have a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling, salted 
water, allowing 1 tsp. salt to 1 pt. water. Put a slightly 
buttered muffin-ring in the water. 



38 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Break egg carefully into a cup and slip into muffin- 
ring. The water should cover the egg. 

When there is a film on top, and the white is firm,

General Rules for Custards 

When using milk and eggs together in cooking, cook 
them at a low temperature. Soft custards should be 
cooked in a double boiler. Baked custards should be 
set in a pan of hot water while baking. 

When putting hot milk and cold egg together, pour 
the milk on the egg very slowly, while stirring. 

Stir a soft custard all the time while cooking, and 
when done take out of the hot water immediately. 

Should the custard curdle, place the saucepan in cold 
water and beat the custard with a Dover egg-beater. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 41 

A soft custard is done when it forms a coating on a 
spoon. 

A baked custard is done when a silver knife inserted

Yolks of 2 eggs. }/^ tsp. vanilla. 

J^ c. sugar. 

Heat the milk in a double boiler. Beat the egg yolk 
slightly, add the sugar and salt. 

Pour the hot milk over this mixture, stirring until 
the egg is all removed from the sides of the bowl. 

Return to the double boiler, and cook until a 
coating is formed. Strain the custard and, when cool, 
flavor. 

Three egg yolks must be used if the custard is not to 
be used as a sauce. 

Baked Custards 

2 c. milk. 34 c. sugar. 

3 eggs. )^ tsp. salt. 
1 tsp. vanilla or a little grated nutmeg.

MILK 

Signs of Good Milk 

"There should be no sediment of dirt after standing. 
There should be about one-sixth the total depth of 
cream â€” the narrowing neck of the bottle may make it 
seem even more. The milk should keep sweet twenty- 
four hours, and when it tastes sour it should separate 
into curds and whey, not be simply a uniform white 
mass, as is likely to happen when soda is used to keep 
it." 1 

Cottage Cheese 

Heat thick, sour milk over hot water until the whey 
separates. Place in cheesecloth and let drain until no 
whey remains. Salt to taste, adding a little cream to 
give the right consistency. Shape into balls of the de- 
sired size. 

Butter 

Use thick, sour cream. If a large amount, place in 
churn; if small, beat with spoon or egg-beater. When 
small globules of butter have formed, drain off the 

â€¢ Mrs. Richards's " Food Materials and their Adulterations."

Flavoring: vanilla, nutmeg. 
(1 tbsp. liquid rennet may be used instead of junket.) 

Place the milk in double boiler and warm it. Do 
not let it become hot. 

Add the rennet dissolved in the cold water, and stir. 
Add flavoring. 

Keep in a warm place till thick. Then set in a cool 
place, taking care not to shake it. 

Serve cold with a custard sauce.

CREAM SOUPS 

Cream soups are a combination of strained, cooked 
vegetable pulp and white sauce; sometimes a small 
amount of white stock is also used. The proportions 
are equal parts of pulp and white sauce. The vegetables 



44 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

generally used are peas, beans, corn, asparagus, celery, 
and potatoes. 

Usually the vegetable is cooked in a small quantity 
of water, and this is mixed with the pulp before meas- 
uring and adding to the white sauce, but with potatoes 
the water is not used. 

The amount of starch in the vegetable used will make 
it necessary for more or less flout to be used in the 
white sauce; the final consistency of the soup should 
be that of good cream. If the soup stands any length 
of time it will become too thick, but may be thinned 
with hot milk. Allow one cup of soup for each person 
when planning your meal. 

Potato Soup 

1 c. potatoes. 3 tbsp. butter. 

3 c. milk. 2 tbsp. flour. 

1 c. water. Y^ tsp. salt.

MEAT 

The most important of the protein foods are found 
among the different varieties of meat. All meat is 
composed of water, protein and fat, the proportions of 
each varying in different cuts from the same animal, 
and in different animals. 

Beef is more commonly used than any other meat. 
It is best when taken from a young, full-grown animal, 
four to eight years old. The lean meat should be firm 
yet juicy, and should turn a bright red when cut. The 
fat should be generous in amount, creamy white in 
color, and firm to the touch. 

Next to beef, in importance, stands mutton; this, 
like beef, is found in the market the year round, and, 
if the sheep be not more than three or four years old,Â» 
is good. The lean meat should be bright red in color, 
fine grained and juicy. The fat, however, is stronger 
in taste, whiter in color, harder in appearance, and less 
digestible than beef fat. 

Veal, lamb, and pork are less digestible than beef 
and mutton and require more thorough cooking. 

Poultry includes all domestic fowls; it is more expen- 
sive than the varieties of meat already mentioned, and 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 47 

likewise contains less nourishment, but the flavor is 
usually more delicate. 

Game includes all varieties of wild animals used as 
food, such as venison, bear, partridge, quail, rabbits, 
wild turkeys, and squirrel.

FISH 

Fish stands next to eggs and meat as a protein food. 
All fish may be divided into three classes â€” white fish, 
oily fish, shellfish. The oily fish are the richest in ex- 
tractives and fat, but are less easily digested than the 
white fish. 

Only fresh fish should be pm-chased; if good, the 
flesh will be firm and plump, the gills red, and the eyes 
bright.

Boiled Fish 

Wash the fish well in cold water, wipe carefully, and 
rub with a little salt. 

Wrap in cheesecloth, tie the ends, and place in fish 
kettle. Cover with boiling water. Add 

1 tsp. salt. SUce of onion. 

1 bay leaf. Sprig of parsley. 

Cover and simmer 10 m. to every pound. Take 
the fish from the .water as soon as it is done, drain, 
remove the cloth carefully; turn the fish on a hot 
plate and garnish with slices of lemon and parsley. 

Fried Fish 

Clean the fish and wipe as dry as possible. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, roll in flour, then dip in white 
of egg and roll in bread crumbs or corn meal. 

Put into a frying-pan 2 tbsp. of fat which must 
become very hot before the fish is put in. Turn the 
fish with a broad knife or pancake turner, with care 
not to break the fish. 

When cooked an amber color it is ready to turn. 
In serving lay the slices of fish overlapping each other 
on a hot dish, and garnish with slices of lemon and 
parsley. 

Baked Fish 

Scrape the fish free from all scales. Make a small 
opening down the under side and remove the vitals.

Creamed Codfish 

Split salt fish into small pieces. Soak in cold water 
over night. Pour boiling water over it twice in the 
morning. Drain and stir into a white sauce to which 
you have added three eggs, hard cooked, and cut into 
small pieces. Proportions: 

2 c. fish. 3 eggs. ^ c. white sauce. 

Serve with baked potatoes. 

BEANS 

Sometimes we cannot obtain either meat or fish, or 
we do not care to serve animal food, yet we must have 
our protein in some form. Then we find that certain 
vegetables will work in very well, and peas and beans 
head the list. This form of protein is not so easily 
digested, nor is it so thoroughly assimilated by the 
system, and it would be very unwise to use it commonly, 
but occasionally it is most acceptable. 

We may serve plain boiled lima beans, Boston baked 
beans, or bean soup; but with many the Spanish beans 
will prove to be the most appetizing. 

Spanish Beans 

2 tbsp. vinegar. Salt to taste. 

1 onion. 1 spk. cayenne. 

2 tbsp. sugar. 2 c. tomato.

HOUSEKEEPING 
Laundry Work 

When preparing for laundry work, sort out the clothes 
carefully, remove stains, prepare the first water, and 
place the more delicate articles in it. If the water is 
hard, soften by the use of a very little soda water (sal 
soda dissolved in hot water) or borax water. Vary the 
amount of soap according to the kind used. Soak all 
white clothes for an hour or more before washing; 
wash the delicate articles without rubbing; put clothes 
through five waters, if possible. Make bluing water 
the shade of the clear sky at the zenith. 

Set the color in delicate fabrics. Sugar of lead is 
good for blues. Use 1 oz. to 1 gal. of water, and 
soak 1 h. (Remember that this is a poison and keep 
it on a high shelf, plainly marked.) Ordinary colors 
will do well with salt in the rinsing-water after the 
first time; allow 1 tbsp. salt to 1 qt. of water. Vine- 
gar is often used for lavender and purple; the propor- 
tion is the same as salt. Alum is good for green; the 
proportion is the same. 

When possible, boil all white clothes, using a small 
amount of soap in the water. 

Hot starch should be used generally for all clothes 
that are to be stiffened. Use 

1 tbsp. starch. Yi tsp. borax. 



A HANDBOOK .^OF<HOME ECONOMICS 63 

Mix with a little cold water and stir in boiling water 
until transparent. 

Flannel and silk should be washed in warm, soapy- 
water (Wool Soap or Ivory Soap will give good results), 
rinsed carefully in water of the same temperatm-e, and 
hung to dry immediately. (Always wash these by hand, 
without using the washboard.) Iron the silk before it 
is fully dry, but allow the flannel to dry thoroughly. 
Very soft silk may be dipped in water in which gum 
arable has been dissolved. Mix 1 oz. of gum with 1 pt. 
of hot water, strain through a cloth, and use 2 tsp. to 
1 c. of water. 



To Remove Stains 

Tea or Coffee. â€” Rinse well and pour boiling water 
over the stain. 

Chocolate. â€” Sprinkle with powdered borax and soak 
well in cold water. Add boiling water. 

Fruit. â€” Dip into Javelle water and rinse thor- 
oughly, or treat like tea stains. 

Ink. â€” Soak two or three hours in coal oil, remove 
and wash in strong soap-suds, or rub with lemon juice 
and salt. 

Calla lily. â€” Nothing satisfactory; try ammonia 
several times. 

Milk. â€” Wash quickly in cold water. 

Scorch. â€” Hang in sun and try soap solution. 

Grass. â€” Wash in alcohol and rub well. 



64 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Paint. â€” Rub with benzine or turpentine. 

Blood. â€” Soak in cold water until stain turns brown, 
then wash in warm water and soap. 

Mildew. â€” Rub lemon juice upon the spots and place 
in sunshine. Salt may also be used. 

Iron Rust. â€” Spread carefully over bowl in which 
you have placed J^ tsp. borax and 1 pt. water. Drop 
by drop apply acid until the stain brightens; then dip 
directly in water. Repeat if necessary. It is often 
wise to add ammonia to the rinsing water.

BATTERS 

Any mixture of flour and liquid thin enough to be 
beaten is called a batter. Batter may be divided into 
three classes, â€” thin, thick, and drop-batters. 

The proportions for the thin batters are equal parts 
of flour and liquid. 

The proportions for the thick batter are tAvice as 
much flour as liquid. 

A drop-batter requires enough flour to cause it to 
fall readily from the spoon.

BREAD 

In our work with marmalade we have been very 
careful to destroy anything that might cause fermenta- 
tion in our finished product. Now we are going to work 
with just the opposite idea in mind. Our earlier lessons 
in doughs have been where the carbon dioxide was 
quickly formed and quickly escaped. When we study 
bread, we find that even the quickest process requires 
several hours, and frequently six to eight hours pass 
before the finished loaves come from the oven. 

The foundation of good bread is good flour and good 
yeast; let either of these be poor and the result is a 
partial failure. By good yeast is meant fresh, pure 
yeast which will grow rapidly and help to produce the 
carbon dioxide we want, and only that. Yeast is a tiny 
plant that grows very rapidly but cannot be seen with- 
out a microscope; to develop thus rapidly it must have 
a warm, not hot, atmosphere, with plenty of food and 
drink. As it grows in the dough it splits up the sugar 
in the mixture, and from this comes the carbon dioxide 
which makes the bread light. A certain amount of 
alcohol is also thrown off, but this escapes before the 
bread is thoroughly baked. 

Remember first the tlirce necessary ingredients in 



good bread: good flour, good yeast, milk or water; then 
the three accessories which are added to make it taste 
better: sugar, salt, shortening. 

The kneading is necessary to make the gluten elastic, 
for without this we could not have spongy bread. If 
possible, let this be done in the home with the bread- 
mixer, leaving the hand-kneading to the end of the 
process when the dough is shaped into loaves. 

Bread Made with Milk or Water 

2 c. boiling water, or 1 tbsp. sugar. 

1 c. milk and 1 c. water. J^ tbsp. salt. 
1 tbsp. butter. J^ yeast cake. 

1 tbsp. lard. 3^ c. lukewarm water. 

About 6 c. sifted flour. 

Place shortening, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, pour 
in the boiling water, or boiling water and scalded milk. 

When the mixture is blood warm, add the dissolved 
yeast cake and 5 c. flour. Stir till thoroughly mixed, 
using a knife or wooden spoon. 

Add remaining flour, mix, turn on a floured board, 
leaving a clean bowl. Knead until the mixture is 
smooth and elastic to the touch, and bubbles may be 
seen under the surface. 

Return to the bowl, cover with a clean cloth and a 
board or tin cover, let it rise over night in a tempera- 
ture of 65Â° F. Or, use a whole yeast cake and let it rise 
for 2 or 3 h., or until 2)/^ times its original size. 



80 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Turn on floured board, knead, shape in loaves or bis- 
cuits, place in greased pans, having the pans nearly full. 

Let the dough rise to double its size, and bake in a

THE CARE OF THE BEDROOM 

The only room in which we are likely to pass six to 
ten hours daily, without any change, is our sleeping- 
room. No other room in the whole house should be 
more carefully selected or better ventilated than this. 
The best of all is to sleep out of doors, but only a 
few can do this, and we must try to make the air 
in our rooms as much like outdoor air as we possibly 
can. 

In selecting our sleeping-room let us have a sunny 
exposure, with windows, if possible, on two sides, and 
the space so planned that a bed may fit in without 
standing in front of one window. If we can, let us 
have a hardwood floor, or a painted one, with a few 
rugs that can be easily cleaned; if this is not possible, 
the floor may be covered with a good matting. The 
furnishings should be Ught, simple, and such as may 
be easily cleaned. The walls should be of soft tone, 
and the curtains light, so that the air will pass through 
readily. 

For the bed itself select a light brass or iron frame 
and put all the money you can afford into your mat- 
tress. Whatever kind you select, let it be the best 
possible, but not too soft. Be sure that the spring is 
firm; where this gives too much one does not rest so well. 
Cover the mattress with a case of unbleached muslin 
that can be easily removed and laundered, and place 
a thin washable pad under the sheet. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 83 

Let the sheets be long enough to tuck in securely at 
the bottom and turn over well at the top, and make 
them of firm, well-woven sheeting. Choose several 
light-weight covers rather than one heavy one, using 
blankets whenever you can afford them â€” wool blank- 
ets, or those that are three-quarters wool. 

Let the spread be simple and light and easily laun- 
dered, and make the pillow-slips long enough to really 
cover the pillows.

SALADS 

There is no line of cookery in which more care and 
study are required to gain the best results than in salad- 
making. Yet, when understood, nothing is more simple. 



84 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Certain things are essential to success â€” such as crisp 
lettuce, good oHve oil, a well-made dressing, fresh fruits 
and vegetables, well-prepared meat and fish. 

All lettuce must be well washed, the leaves dried in 
a soft cloth, then placed close to the ice in a cheese- 
cloth, or, if nothing else is at hand, a paper bag. The 
uncooked vegetables must be tender and thoroughly 
chilled; the cooked vegetables cut into attractive shapes, 
when desired, and then kept unbroken; fish should be 
freed from all skin and bone and separated into distinct 
flakes; meat must be diced after being freed from bone, 
fat, and all gristle. 

When using cooked vegetables, or meat and fish, 
mix the French dressing with the prepared ingredients 
a half hour or more before serving. The best result is 
obtained by mixing each kind separately, putting to- 
gether just before serving. 

Always try to make the salad dainty and attractive 
when serving. If in individual form, shape the lettuce 
leaves into cup shapes, and garnish â€” where possible â€” 
with some special vegetables, or with olives. 

Remember that the simpler salad-dressings are the 
more wholesome, and should be the ones most com- 
monly used. 

French Dressing 

1 tbsp. vinegar or lemon juice. Yi tsp. salt. 

3 tbsp. olive oil. Spk. pepper. 

yi tsp. paprika 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 85 

Place the salt and pepper in a bowl, add oil slowly,

Add vinegar and water, then butter, and put in a 
double boiler, stirring until thick. 

This dressing will keep several weeks in a covered jar. 
When ready to use, add sour cream, sweet cream, or 
milk, to thin it to the desired consistency. The pro- 
portions of water and vinegar vary with the strength 
of the vinegar. 

Note. â€” 1 tsp. of flour and one whole egg may be 
used in place of three yolks. 

Apple and Celery Salad 

2 c. apples, cut in small cubes.

FROZEN DISHES 

Some of our best and simplest desserts are the sher- 
bets, ices, and creams. An ice is simply fruit juice, 
water, and sugar, frozen together. A sherbet is, usu- 
ally, the same as an ice with the addition of stiff egg 
whites. A cream should be pure cream, flavoring, and 
sugar, or a rich custard with cream added, in equal 
quantities. This last combination is the richest of all. 

In packing the freezer use three parts of ice to one of 
salt. See that the crank works easily before beginning 
to pack, and test occasionally while filling with the ice 
and salt. Do not fill the can more than two-thirds full 
of the ice cream or sherbet, otherwise it will run over 
before it is frozen. Turn very slowly at first, stopping 
once or twice; when too hard to turn, remove dasher, 
pack down, cover closely, repack with salt and ice, and 
allow it to stand several hours to harden. 

Fruit Sherbet 

3 oranges. 3 c. sugar. 

3 lemons. 3 c. water. 

1 banana. 2 egg whites. 

Yi can apricots.

sary, pack and freeze. 

Lemon Milk Sherbet

2 c. chopped pineapple (or 1 qt. can). 

1 c. orange juice. 

3^ c. lemon juice. 

Boil water, sugar, and pineapple 20 m. 
Add fruit juice; cool, strain, and dilute with ice water. 
Any of the following fruits may be added:

PREFACE 

The plan in this little book has been to give a simple 
basis for the pupil to work from, leaving the teacher 
free to present the lesson in her own way. The princi- 
pal points to be brought out are suggested by the 
questions at the end of each lesson. These questions 
are to be answered by the pupil in the spare moments 
which are so often wasted in the course of an ordinary 
cookery period. 

This course may be completed in one school year, 
or in two, according to the frequency of the lessons. 
The book is divided into two parts for the convenience 
of classes which devote two years to the subject. 



PART I 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME 
ECONOMICS 

SUGGESTIONS FOR HOUSEKEEPING 

Let each pupil provide herself with two large, plain, 
white aprons made from cambric, long cloth, or linen; 
avoid lawn because it wears so short a time and rumples 
so easily. In addition to the aprons, every girl should 
have her own small hand- towel and cookery holder; the 
towel need not be more than eighteen inches long, and 
the holder should not be over five inches square. 

When working in the cookery room, keep the wrists 
free from bracelets and the fingers free from rings; let 
the hair be neat and away from the face. 

Before beginning the lesson see that the hands are 
thoroughly washed and the nails well cleaned. Keep 
the hand-towel fastened at the waist, ready for imme- 
diate use. 

When the lesson is over, fold both apron and towel 
neatly and place in the locker assigned. Before leav- 
ing the class-room be sure that all utensils are in perfect 
order and, if possible, that your notes are all placed in 
your text-book. 



4 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Dish-Washing 

Clean all plates and dishes; if they are greasy, use 
brown paper; if not, scrape with a rubber scraper or 
with a case-knife. 

Arrange neatly and in the most convenient manner. 
Use hot, soapy water, filling the dishpan about one- 
third full. Change the water frequently if many dishes 
are to be washed. Rinse all dishes with clear, hot 
water and wipe with clean towels free from lint. 

Wash glassware first. If an extra polish is desired, 
wipe from the soapy water.

FOOD 

The food which we eat may be divided into three 
distinct classes: proteins, carbohydrates, fats. These 
will be studied in detail as we advance in the work. 
Try to remember now that protein foods are the chief 
sources of tissue and muscle, and that the carbohydrates 
and fats give us energy and fat. 

MILK 

The first food that children take is milk, and for the 
young child this seems an almost perfect food. Since 
all young children must live on it, it is necessary for 
us to know how to tell good milk and how to care for 
it. It is very difficult to get fresh, pure milk in the 
large cities, and nothing that comes into the house 
requires more care. 

Care of Milk 

Select the best dairy you can find. Wipe milk bottles 
when brought into the house. Place in refrigerator or 
cold closet. If turned from bottles, place in glass, agate- 
ware, earthenware, granite, or aluminum, and keep 
covered. If doubtful about the purity, scald. To 
scald the milk, heat over hot water; when a bead-like 
ring forms around the edge, it is scalded. Remove 
directly. Greater heat makes the milk less digestible.

HOUSEKEEPING 
Care of Refrigerator 

Look over the refrigerator daily to see that no food 
is left to spoil. Food with a strong flavor, or hot food, 
should not be put into the refrigerator. 

Once a week every part of the refrigerator should be 
washed with a solution of washing-soda, a dish mop 
being used. Rinse, wipe as dry as possible, and air 
thoroughly before using again. Flush the waste-pipe 
with the soda solution. 

Care of the Sink 

Always pour dishwater through a sink strainer, and 
put the refuse left in strainer in garbage pail. 

When dish-washing is finished, wash every part of 
the sink and sink strainer with hot, soapy water. Wash 
above and around the sink, and use a scrubbing brush 
and a skewer when necessary. 

Flush the sink with boiling water every day, and 
about once a week with a strong, hot solution of washing- 
soda. (Cover 1 c. washing-soda with 6 qts. boiling 
water and let remain on the fire until all the soda is 
dissolved. Pour this, boiling hot, into the pipes, using 
2 to 3 qts. for each sink.) 

Garbage 

Garbage should be burned, or should be put into 
large pails to be collected several times a week. These 



18 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

garbage pails should be cleaned thoroughly with the 
hose, after emptying, and dried well in the sun. When 
necessary, a strong, hot solution of washing-soda should 
be used to clean them. 

Scraps in the kitchen should be put into a granite- 
ware pail. This scrap pail should be emptied into the 
garbage pail every day. It should be washed as any 
other dish and thoroughly dried. Once a week it should 
be washed with the soda solution. 

Care of the Range 

When grease or other material is spilled on the range 
while cooking is being done, rub off at once with paper. 

Beside cleaning out the ashes from the range every 
day, the space above and below the oven should be 
cleaned out about once a month, as the soot and ashes 
collected there prevent the proper heating of the oven. 

Never blacken the range without cleaning it first. 
Moisten some stove polish with cold water and rub it 
over the range with a brush or cloth. Blacken when 
stove is cold. 

Use a dry brush for polishing, rubbing very briskly. 
Begin at front of range when the stove is warm. 

To Clean Metals 

Always wash articles carefully before cleaning. After 
cleaning, wash in hot water containing ammonia, and 
dry carefully. The following cleansing agents may be 
used: 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 19 

Tin. â€” Sapolio or silver-polish; whiting, moistened 
with ammonia, alcohol, or water.

CEREALS 

The most important cereal food products are those 
prepared from wheat, corn, rice, and oats. 

Composition 

"Cereals contain all the food principles; they aver- 
age about two-thirds carbohydrates, one-tenth protein, 
one-tenth water, and they contain a little fat and min- 
eral matter." 



22 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Their chief value, however, lies in their starch com- 
position, and because of this they require thorough 
cooking. 



Rules for Cooking 

Allow 34 tsp. salt to 1 c. boiling water. 
Allow 1 c. rolled cereal to 2 c. boiling water. 
Allow 1 c. coarse cereal to 3 c. boiling water.

Gruels 

In many cases of sickness the patient is unable to 
take any solid food, and a gruel is prescribed by the 
physician. This is nothing but a cereal cooked with a 
much larger proportion of water; usually we use one 
tablespoonful of the cereal to one cup of water or milk, 
and cook very thoroughly. The gruel is then strained, 
seasoned with salt, and served very hot.

SERVICE 
The Breakfast Table 

Arrange cups and saucers, creamer and sugar bowl, in 
front of the hostess. A coffee-stand should be placed 
at the right of the hostess for the coffee-pot. 

All heavy dishes are placed in front of the host, so 
that he may serve. 

With fruit, finger bowls should be used. 

The Dinner Table 

The carving set and knife and fork rests should be 
laid in front of the host. The host serves the fish and 
meat. 

The soup ladle should be placed in front of the host- 
ess, handle to the right. The hostess should serve the 
soup, salad, dessert, and coffee, and usually the vege- 
tables.

A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 33 

Rules for Serving 

Cold food should be served on cold dishes, hot food 
on hot dishes. 

Never fill glasses or cups more than three-fourths 
full. Fill before each course. 

Do not let the table become disorderly during the 
meal. 

When passing a dish, hold it so that the thumb will 
not rest upon the upper surface. 

The waitress should stand at the back of the hostess, 
or while the meat is being carved, at the back of the 
host. She should take each plate from the left as it is 
ready to serve, in her right hand, and place it before 
the person for whom it is intended. Everything is 
served at the left, except liquids in glasses, or cups and 
saucers. 

In passing dishes from which a person is to help 
himself, pass always to the left side, so that the food 
may be taken with the right hand. 

All soiled dishes should be removed from the left. 
The waitress should never pile one dish upon another. 

When one course is finished, soiled dishes should be 
removed first, then food, then clean dishes, then 
crumbs. 

When folding the tablecloth or napkins always fold 
very carefully in the same creases. 



PART II 



EGGS 

Eggs are a tissue-building food, the chief protein 
being a form of albumen. In food value and in digesti- 
bility they compare favorably with meat, and during 
the spring and summer should be freely used. 

When an egg is perfectly fresh it will sink to the 
bottom of a brine made in the proportion of two ounces 
of salt to one pint of water; if stale, the egg will float 
upon the surface. If a stale egg is shaken gently it will 
give a rattling sound. 

Soft-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 6 to 8 m. 

Hard-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 40 to 45 m. 

Poached Eggs on Toast 

Have a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling, salted 
water, allowing 1 tsp. salt to 1 pt. water. Put a slightly 
buttered muffin-ring in the water. 



38 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Break egg carefully into a cup and slip into muffin- 
ring. The water should cover the egg. 

When there is a film on top, and the white is firm, 
carefully take up ring and egg with a buttered griddle- 
cake turner and place egg on a circular piece of buttered 
toast.

Beat eggs slightly with a fork, add milk and season- 
ing. Melt butter in saucepan, turn in the egg mixture, 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 39 

and stir over a slow fire until it begins to set. Remove 
from fire and cook over hot water until firm, but not 
hard. Serve at once on slices of buttered toast. 

Light Omelet 

2 eggs. % tsp. salt. 

1 tsp. butter. 1 spk. pepper. 

2 tbsp. water. 

Separate yolk from white of eggs. Beat yolks until 
light and creamy, add salt, pepper, and water. Beat 
whites until stiff, cut, and fold them into the yolks. 

Heat omelet pan, and butter sides and bottom. Turn 
in the mixture, spread evenly, place where it will cook 
slowly, occasionally turning the pan that omelet may 
brown evenly. 

When omelet is well risen and delicately browned 
underneath, place pan on oven grate to finish cooking. 
Fold and turn upon a hot platter. 

French Omelet 

3 eggs. Y2 tsp. salt. Spk. pepper. 

Beat the eggs, with the seasoning, just enough to 
break the yolks. Melt Y2 "tsp. butter in a frying-pan. 
Turn in the egg mixture, and with a fork lift the cooked 
portions of the egg, allowing the liquid on top to run 
down underneath. When the egg is cooked, but still 
quite soft on top, slip the knife underneath and roll 



40 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

the omelet to the center. Let it cook for a moment, 
then turn upon a hot platter. Serve at once. 



Estimate cost of each recipe and note the number of

and pour over the toasted bread. 

Press the yolks through a strainer and sprinkle over 
the top. 

General Rules for Custards 

When using milk and eggs together in cooking, cook 
them at a low temperature. Soft custards should be 
cooked in a double boiler. Baked custards should be 
set in a pan of hot water while baking. 

When putting hot milk and cold egg together, pour 
the milk on the egg very slowly, while stirring. 

Stir a soft custard all the time while cooking, and 
when done take out of the hot water immediately. 

Should the custard curdle, place the saucepan in cold 
water and beat the custard with a Dover egg-beater. 



A HANDBOOK: OF HOME ECONOMICS 41 

A soft custard is done when it forms a coating on a 
spoon. 

A baked custard is done when a silver knife inserted 
in the custard comes out clean. 

Custard Sauce 

13^2 c. milk. Y% * S P- sa lt- 

Yolks of 2 eggs. Y2 tsp. vanilla. 

Y c. sugar. 

Heat the milk in a double boiler. Beat the egg yolk 
slightly, add the sugar and salt. 

Pour the hot milk over this mixture, stirring until 
the egg is all removed from the sides of the bowl. 

Return to the double boiler, and cook until a 
coating is formed. Strain the custard and, when cool, 
flavor. 

Three egg yolks must be used if the custard is not to 
be used as a sauce. 

Baked Custards 

2 c. milk. Y c. sugar. 

3 eggs. Y% tsp. salt. 
1 tsp. vanilla or a little grated nutmeg. 

Beat the eggs and sugar together until light. Add 
milk and vanilla. Pour into buttered custard cups. 
Stand in pan of hot water. 

Bake in oven until custards are firm in the middle. 
Turn out when cold.

MILK 
Signs of Good Milk 

"There should be no sediment of dirt after standing. 
There should be about one-sixth the total depth of 
cream â€” the narrowing neck of the bottle may make it 
seem even more. The milk should keep sweet twenty- 
four hours, and when it tastes sour it should separate 
into curds and whey, not be simply a uniform white 
mass, as is likely to happen when soda is used to keep 
it." * 

Cottage Cheese 

Heat thick, sour milk over hot water until the whey 
separates. Place in cheesecloth and let drain until no 
whey remains. Salt to taste, adding a little cream to 
give the right consistency. Shape into balls of the de- 
sired size. 

Butter 

Use thick, sour cream. If a large amount, place in 
churn; if small, beat with spoon or egg-beater. When 
small globules of butter have formed, drain off the 

1 Mrs. Richards's " Food Materials and their Adulterations." 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 43 

buttermilk, wash in clear, cold water, salt to taste, and 
shape in rolls or balls. 

Junket or Thick Milk 

1 qt. milk. 2 tbsp. cold water. 

1 junket tablet. 34 c. sugar. 

Flavoring: vanilla, nutmeg. 
(1 tbsp. liquid rennet may be used instead of junket.) 

Place the milk in double boiler and warm it. Do 
not let it become hot. 

Add the rennet dissolved in the cold water, and stir. 
Add flavoring. 

Keep in a warm place till thick. Then set in a cool 
place, taking care not to shake it. 

Serve cold with a custard sauce.

CREAM SOUPS 

Cream soups are a combination of strained, cooked 
vegetable pulp and white sauce; sometimes a small 
amount of white stock is also used. The proportions 
are equal parts of pulp and white sauce. The vegetables 



44 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

generally used are peas, beans, corn, asparagus, celery, 
and potatoes. 

Usually the vegetable is cooked in a small quantity 
of water, and this is mixed with the pulp before meas- 
uring and adding to the white sauce, but with potatoes 
the water is not used. 

The amount of starch in the vegetable used will make 
it necessary for more or less flour to be used in the 
white sauce; the final consistency of the soup should 
be that of good cream. If the soup stands any length 
of time it will become too thick, but may be thinned 
with hot milk. Allow one cup of soup for each person 
when planning your meal. 

Potato Soup 

1 c. potatoes. 3 tbsp. butter. 

3 c. milk. 2 tbsp. flour. 

1 c. water. 3^ tsp. salt. 

1 stalk celery. Spk. pepper. 

34 onion. Spk. celery salt. 

Boil potatoes, and mash. Cook milk, celery, and onion 
together 20 m. in double boiler. Add to potato, thicken 
as for white sauce, strain, and serve at once. 

Mock Bisque Soup 

2 c. milk. 3 tbsp. butter. 

3 tbsp. flour. Spk. pepper. 

2 c. tomato juice. 34 tsp. baking soda. 

Yi tsp. salt. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 45 

Combine milk, butter, flour, salt, and pepper as for 
white sauce. Heat tomato and stir in soda, let the

J/g tsp. celery salt. 

Cook corn and water fifteen minutes. Strain. Cook 
the onion in the milk, in a double boiler, before making 
the white sauce. Add the strained corn pulp and sea- 
soning to white sauce, and serve. 

Tomato Soup 

1 pt. strained tomato juice. 

1 pt. water in which peas and pea pods have been 
cooked.

MEAT 

The most important of the protein foods are found 
among the different varieties of meat. All meat is 
composed of water, protein and fat, the proportions of 
each varying in different cuts from the same animal, 
and in different animals. 

Beef is more commonly used than any other meat. 
It is best when taken from a young, full-grown animal, 
four to eight years old. The lean meat should be firm 
yet juicy, and should turn a bright red when cut. The 
fat should be generous in amount, creamy white in 
color, and firm to the touch. 

Next to beef, in importance, stands mutton; this, 
like beef, is found in the market the year round, and, 
if the sheep be not more than three or four years old, 
is good. The lean meat should be bright red in color, 
fine grained and juicy. The fat, however, is stronger 
in taste, whiter in color, harder in appearance, and less 
digestible than beef fat. 

Veal, lamb, and pork are less digestible than beef 
and mutton and require more thorough cooking. 

Poultry includes all domestic fowls; it is more expen- 
sive than the varieties of meat already mentioned, and 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 47 

likewise contains less nourishment, but the flavor is 
usually more delicate. 

Game includes all varieties of wild animals used as 
food, such as venison, bear, partridge, quail, rabbits, 
wild turkeys, and squirrel.

FISH 

Fish stands next to eggs and meat as a protein food. 
All fish may be divided into three classes â€” white fish, 
oily fish, shellfish. The oily fish are the richest in ex- 
tractives and fat, but are less easily digested than the 
white fish. 

Only fresh fish should be purchased; if good, the 
flesh will be firm and plump, the gills red, and the eyes 
bright.

Creamed Codfish 

Split salt fish into small pieces. Soak in cold water 
over night. Pour boiling water over it twice in the 
morning. Drain and stir into a white sauce to which 
you have added three eggs, hard cooked, and cut into 
small pieces. Proportions: 

2 c. fish. 3 eggs. % c. white sauce. 

Serve with baked potatoes. 

BEANS 

Sometimes we cannot obtain either meat or fish, or 
we do not care to serve animal food, yet we must have 
our protein in some form. Then we find that certain 
vegetables will work in very well, and peas and beans 
head the list. This form of protein is not so easily 
digested, nor is it so thoroughly assimilated by the 
system, and it would be very unwise to use it commonly, 
but occasionally it is most acceptable. 

We may serve plain boiled lima beans, Boston baked 
beans, or bean soup; but with many the Spanish beans 
will prove to be the most appetizing. 

Spanish Beans 
2 tbsp. vinegar. Salt to taste. 

1 onion. 1 spk. cayenne. 

2 tbsp. sugar. 2 c. tomato. 

1 pt. pink beans. 34 of a red pepper. 

4 tbsp. butter. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 61 

1. Soak the beans over night; boil in salted water 
until tender. 

2. Change the water three times during cooking. Be 
sure to add boiling water each time. 

3. Remove two-thirds of the beans. 

4. Add remaining materials, with exception of 
salt and butter, to beans left in kettle, and boil 

5. Press these beans, with the onion, etc., through a 
sieve; add the water they were boiled in. 

6. Pour this mixture over the whole beans, heat 
again, adding 4 tbsp. butter, and salt to taste. 

Note. â€” A 2-in. piece of fat salt pork may be boiled 
with the beans, and less butter used. 



Lima Beans 
1 pt. dried Lima beans. 

Pick over carefully, wash, soak in cold water over 
night. Place in fresh boiling water and cook gently 1 
to 1M h. 

Drain, season with salt and butter, and serve hot.

HOUSEKEEPING 

Laundry Work 

When preparing for laundry work, sort out the clothes 
carefully, remove stains, prepare the first water, and 
place the more delicate articles in it. If the water is 
hard, soften by the use of a very little soda water (sal 
soda dissolved in hot water) or borax water. Vary the 
amount of soap according to the kind used. Soak all 
white clothes for an hour or more before washing; 
wash the delicate articles without rubbing; put clothes 
through five waters, if possible. Make bluing water 
the shade of the clear sky at the zenith. 

Set the color in delicate fabrics. Sugar of lead is 
good for blues. Use 1 oz. to 1 gal. of water, and 
soak 1 h. (Remember that this is a poison and keep 
it on a high shelf, plainly marked.) Ordinary colors 
will do well with salt in the rinsing-water after the 
first time; allow 1 tbsp. salt to 1 qt. of water. Vine- 
gar is often used for lavender and purple; the propor- 
tion is the same as salt. Alum is good for green; the 
proportion is the same. 

When possible, boil all white clothes, using a small 
amount of soap in the water. 

Hot starch should be used generally for all clothes 
that are to be stiffened. Use 

1 tbsp. starch. Yo tsp. borax. 



A HANDBOOK OF. HOME ECONOMICS 63 

Mix with a little cold water and stir in boiling water 
until transparent. 

Flannel and silk should be washed in warm, soapy 
water (Wool Soap or Ivory Soap will give good results), 
rinsed carefully in water of the same temperature, and 
hung to dry immediately. (Always wash these by hand, 
without using the washboard.) Iron the silk before it 
is fully dry, but allow the flannel to dry thoroughly. 
Very soft silk may be dipped in water in which gum 
arabic has been dissolved. Mix 1 oz. of gum with 1 pt. 
of hot water, strain through a cloth, and use 2 tsp. to 
1 c. of water. 



To Remove Stains 

Tea or Coffee. â€” Rinse well and pour boiling water 
over the stain. 

Chocolate. â€” Sprinkle with powdered borax and soak 
well in cold water. Add boiling water. 

Fruit. â€” Dip into Javelle water and rinse thor- 
oughly, or treat like tea stains. 

Ink. â€” Soak two or three hours in coal oil, remove 
and wash in strong soap-suds, or rub with lemon juice 
and salt. 

Calla lily. â€” Nothing satisfactory; try ammonia 
several times. 

Milk. â€” Wash quickly in cold water. 

Scorch. â€” Hang in sun and try soap solution. 

Grass. â€” Wash in alcohol and rub well. 



64 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Paint. â€” Rub with benzine or turpentine. 

Blood. â€” Soak in cold water until stain turns brown, 
then wash in warm water and soap. 

Mildew. â€” Rub lemon juice upon the spots and place 
in sunshine. Salt may also be used. 

Iron Rust. â€” Spread carefully over bowl in which 
you have placed J/Â£ tsp. borax and 1 pt. water. Drop 
by drop apply acid until the stain brightens; then dip 
directly in water. Repeat if necessary. It is often 
wise to add ammonia to the rinsing water. 



Javelle Water 

4 lbs. washing soda. 
4 qts. boiling water. 
1 lb. chloride of lime. 

Dissolve soda in water in agate or granite-ware 
kettle, boil 10 m., stir in the lime gradually. When 
cold, strain through cloth and place in bottles. For 
ordinary bleaching, use 1 c. to 8 qts. of water. Do not 
leave in the water over 5 m.

BATTERS 

Any mixture of flour and liquid thin enough to be 
beaten is called a batter. Batter may be divided into 
three classes, â€” thin, thick, and drop-batters. 

The proportions for the thin batters are equal parts 
of flour and liquid. 

The proportions for the thick batter are twice as 
much flour as liquid. 

A drop-batter requires enough flour to cause it to 
fall readily from the spoon.

BREAD 

In our work with marmalade we have been very 
careful to destroy anything that might cause fermenta- 
tion in our finished product. Now we are going to work 
with just the opposite idea in mind. Our earlier lessons 
in doughs have been where the carbon dioxide was 
quickly formed and quickly escaped. When we study 
bread, we find that even the quickest process requires 
several hours, and frequently six to eight hours pass 
before the finished loaves come from the oven. 

The foundation of good bread is good flour and good 
yeast; let either of these be poor and the result is a 
partial failure. By good yeast is meant fresh, pure 
yeast which will grow rapidly and help to produce the 
carbon dioxide we want, and only that. Yeast is a tiny 
plant that grows very rapidly but cannot be seen with- 
out a microscope; to develop thus rapidly it must have 
a warm, not hot, atmosphere, with plenty of food and 
drink. As it grows in the dough it splits up the sugar 
in the mixture, and from this comes the carbon dioxide 
which makes the bread light. A certain amount of 
alcohol is also thrown off, but this escapes before the 
bread is thoroughly baked. 

Remember first the three necessary ingredients in 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 79 

good bread: good flour, good yeast, milk or water; then 
the three accessories which are added to make it taste 
better: sugar, salt, shortening. 

The kneading is necessary to make the gluten elastic, 
for without this we could not have spongy bread. If 
possible, let this be done in the home with the bread- 
mixer, leaving the hand-kneading to the end of the 
process when the dough is shaped into loaves. 

Bread Made with Milk or Water 

2 c. boiling water, or 1 tbsp. sugar. 

1 c. milk and 1 c. water. 3^2 tbsp. salt. 
1 tbsp. butter. 34 yeast cake. 

1 tbsp. lard. 34 c. lukewarm water. 

About 6 c. sifted flour. 

Place shortening, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, pour 
in the boiling water, or boiling water and scalded milk. 

When the mixture is blood warm, add the dissolved 
yeast cake and 5 c. flour. Stir till thoroughly mixed, 
using a knife or wooden spoon. 

Add remaining flour, mix, turn on a floured board, 
leaving a clean bowl. Knead until the mixture is 
smooth and elastic to the touch, and bubbles may be 
seen under the surface. 

Return to the bowl, cover with a clean cloth and a 
board or tin cover, let it rise over night in a tempera- 
ture of 65Â° F. Or, use a whole yeast cake and let it rise 
for 2 or 3 h., or until 2J^ times its original size.

Turn on floured board, knead, shape in loaves or bis- 
cuits, place in greased pans, having the pans nearly full.

THE CARE OF THE BEDROOM 

The only room in which we are likely to pass six to 
ten hours daily, without any change, is our sleeping- 
room. No other room in the whole house should be 
more carefully selected or better ventilated than this. 
The best of all is to sleep out of doors, but only a 
few can do this, and we must try to make the air 
in our rooms as much like outdoor air as we possibly 
can. 

In selecting our sleeping-room let us have a sunny 
exposure, with windows, if possible, on two sides, and 
the space so planned that a bed may fit in without 
standing in front of one window. If we can, let us 
have a hardwood floor, or a painted one, with a few 
rugs that can be easily cleaned; if this is not possible, 
the floor may be covered with a good matting. The 
furnishings should be light, simple, and such as may 
be easily cleaned. The walls should be of soft tone, 
and the curtains light, so that the air will pass through 
readily. 

For the bed itself select a light brass or iron frame 
and put all the money you can afford into your mat- 
tress. Whatever kind you select, let it be the best 
possible, but not too soft. Be sure that the spring is 
firm; where this gives too much one does not rest so well. 
Cover the mattress with a case of unbleached muslin 
that can be easily removed and laundered, and place 
a thin washable pad under the sheet. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 83 

Let the sheets be long enough to tuck in securely at 
the bottom and turn over well at the top, and make 
them of firm, well-woven sheeting. Choose several 
light-weight covers rather than one heavy one, using 
blankets whenever you can afford them â€” wool blank- 
ets, or those that are three-quarters wool. 

Let the spread be simple and light and easily laun- 
dered, and make the pillow-slips long enough to really 
cover the pillows.

SALADS 

There is no line of cookery in which more care and 
study are required to gain the best results than in salad- 
making. Yet, when understood, nothing is more simple. 



84 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Certain things are essential to success â€” such as crisp 
lettuce, good olive oil, a well-made dressing, fresh fruits 
and vegetables, well-prepared meat and fish. 

All lettuce must be well washed, the leaves dried in 
a soft cloth, then placed close to the ice in a cheese- 
cloth, or, if nothing else is at hand, a paper bag. The 
uncooked vegetables must be tender and thoroughly 
chilled ; the cooked vegetables cut into attractive shapes, 
when desired, and then kept unbroken; fish should be 
freed from all skin and bone and separated into distinct 
flakes; meat must be diced after being freed from bone, 
fat, and all gristle. 

When using cooked vegetables, or meat and fish, 
mix the French dressing with the prepared ingredients 
a half hour or more before serving. The best result is 
obtained by mixing each kind separately, putting to- 
gether just before serving. 

Always try to make the salad dainty and attractive 
when serving. If in individual form, shape the lettuce 
leaves into cup shapes, and garnish â€” where possible â€” 
with some special vegetables, or with olives. 

Remember that the simpler salad-dressings are the 
more wholesome, and should be the ones most com- 
monly used.

FROZEN DISHES 

Some of our best and simplest desserts are the sher- 
bets, ices, and creams. An ice is simply fruit juice, 
water, and sugar, frozen together. A sherbet is, usu- 
ally, the same as an ice with the addition of stiff egg 
whites. A cream should be pure cream, flavoring, and 
sugar, or a rich custard with cream added, in equal 
quantities. This last combination is the richest of all. 

In packing the freezer use three parts of ice to one of 
salt. See that the crank works easily before beginning 
to pack, and test occasionally while filling with the ice 
and salt. Do not fill the can more than two-thirds full 
of the ice cream or sherbet, otherwise it will run over 
before it is frozen. Turn very slowly at first, stopping 
once or twice; when too hard to turn, remove dasher, 
pack down, cover closely, repack with salt* and ice, and 
allow it to stand several hours to harden.

3 oranges. 3 c. sugar. 

3 lemons. 3 c. water. 

1 banana. 2 egg whites.

PREFACE 

The plan in this little book has been to give a simple 
basis for the pupil to work from, leaving the teacher 
free to present the lesson in her own way. The princi- 
pal points to be brought out are suggested by the 
questions at the end of each lesson. These questions 
are to be answered by the pupil in the spare moments 
which are so often wasted in the course of an ordinary 
cookery period. 

This course may be completed in one school year, 
or in two, according to the frequency of the lessons. 
The book is divided into two parts for the convenience 
of classes which devote two years to the subject. 



PART I 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME 

ECONOMICS 

SUGGESTIONS FOR HOUSEKEEPING 

Let each pupil provide herself with two large, plain, 
white aprons made from cambric, long cloth, or linen; 
avoid lawn because it wears so short a time and rumples 
so easily. In addition to the aprons, every girl should 
have her own small hand-towel and cookery holder; the 
towel need not be more than eighteen inches long, and 
the holder should not be over five inches square. 

When working in the cookery room, keep the wrists 
free from bracelets and the fingers free from rings; let 
the hair be neat and away from the face. 

Before beginning the lesson see that the hands are 
thoroughly washed and the nails well cleaned. Keep 
the hand-towel fastened at the waist, ready for imme- 
diate use. 

When the lesson is over, fold both apron and towel 
neatly and place in the locker assigned. Before leav- 
ing the class-room be sure that all utensils are in perfect 
order and, if possible, that your notes are all placed in 
your text-book. 



4 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Dish-Washing 

Clean all plates and dishes; if they are greasy, use 
brown paper; if not, scrape with a rubber scraper or 
with a case-knife. 

Arrange neatly and in the most convenient manner. 
Use hot, soapy water, filling the dishpan about one- 
third full. Change the water frequently if many dishes 
are to be washed. Rinse all dishes with clear, hot 
water and wipe with clean towels free from lint. 

Wash glassware first. If an extra polish is desired, 
wipe from the soapy water. 

After the glassware, wash the silver, then the china, 
and then the cooking utensils. 

Take fresh, hot water and wash the towels thor- 
oughly, rinse in clear water, stretch carefully and hang 
to dry; fold the dishcloth evenly and hang to dry. 

Be very careful to keep bone, ivory, or wooden handles 
of knives or forks out of the water, and make sure, 
when washing a Dover egg-beater, that only the part 
below the wheel touches the water. 

If a saucepan has become burned place a few tea- 
spoons of baking soda in the pan, fill with warm water 
and let it stand for several horn's or over night.

FOOD 

The food which we eat may be divided into three 
distinct classes: proteins, carbohydrates, fats. These 
will be studied in detail as we advance in the work. 
Try to remember now that protein foods are the chief 
sources of tissue and muscle, and that the carbohydrates 
and fats give us energy and fat. 

MILE 

The first food that children take is milk, and for the 
young child this seems an almost perfect food. Since 
all young children must live on it, it is necessary for 
us to know how to tell good milk and how to care for 
it. It is very diflScult to get fresh, pure milk in the 
large cities, and nothing that comes into the house 
requires more care. 

Care of Milk 

Select the best dairy you can find. Wipe milk bottles 
when brought into the house. Place in refrigerator or 
cold closet. If turned from bottles, place in glass, agate- 
ware, earthenware, granite, or aluminum, and keep 
covered. If doubtful about the purity, scald. To 
scald the milk, heat over hot water; when a bead-like 
ring forms around the edge, it is scalded. Remove 
directly. Greater heat makes the milk less digestible.

HOUSEKEEPING 
Care of Refrigerator / 

Look over the refrigerator daily to see that no food 
is left to spoil. Food with a strong flavor, or hot food, 
should not be put into the refrigerator. 

Once a week every part of the refrigerator should be 
washed with a solution of washing-soda, a dish mop 
being used. Rinse, wipe as dry as possible, and air 
thoroughly before using again. Flush the waste-pipe 
with the soda solution. 

Care of the Sink 

Always pour dishwater through a sink strainer, and 
put the refuse left in strainer in garbage pail. 

When dish-washing is finished, wash every part of 
the sink and sink strainer with hot, soapy water. Wash 
above and around the sink, and use a scrubbing brush 
and a skewer when necessary. 

Flush the sink with boiling water every day, and 
about once a week with a strong, hot solution of washing- 
soda. (Cover 1 c. washing-soda with 6 qts. boiling 
water and let remain on the fire until all the soda is 
dissolved. Pour this, boiling hot, into the pipes, using 
2 to 3 qts. for each sink.) 

Garbage 

Garbage should be burned, or should be put into 
large pails to be collected several times a week. These 



18 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

garbage pails should be cleaned thoroughly with the 
hose, after emptying, and dried well in the sun. When 
necessary, a strong, hot solution of washing-soda should 
be used to clean them. 

Scraps in the kitchen should be put into a granite- 
ware pail. This scrap pail should be emptied into the 
garbage pail every day. It should be washed as any 
other dish and thoroughly dried. Once a week it should 
be washed with the soda solution. 

Care of the Range 

When grease or other material is spilled on the range 
while cooking is being done, rub off at once with paper. 

Beside cleaning out the ashes from the range every 
day, the space above and below the oven should be 
cleaned out about once a month, as the soot and ashes 
collected there prevent the proper heating of the oven. 

Never blacken the range without cleaning it first. 
Moisten some stove polish with cold water and rub it 
over the range with a brush or cloth. Blacken when 
stove is cold. 

Use a dry brush for polishing, rubbing very briskly. 
Begin at front of range when the stove is warm. 

To Clean Metals 

Always wash articles carefully before cleaning. After 
cleaning, wash in hot water containing ammonia, and 
dry carefully. The following cleansing agents may be 
used: 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 19 

Tin. â€” Sapolio or silver-polish; whiting, moistened

CEREALS 

The most important cereal food products are those 
prepared from wheat, com, rice, and oats. 

Composition 

"Cereals contain all the food principles; they aver- 
age about two-thirds carbohydrates, one-tenth protein, 
one-tenth water, and they contain a little fat and min- 
eral matter.'' 



22 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Their chief value, however, lies in their starch com- 
position, and because of this they require thorough 
cooking. 



Rules for Cooking 

Allow J^ tsp. salt to 1 c. boiling water. 
Allow 1 c. rolled cereal to 2 c. boiling water. 
Allow 1 c. coarse cereal to 3 c. boiling water.

Gruels 

In many cases of sickness the patient is unable to 
take any solid food, and a gruel is prescribed by the 
physician. This is nothing but a cereal cooked with a 
much larger proportion of water; usually we use one 
tablespoonf ul of the cereal to one cup of water or milk, 
and cook very thoroughly. The gruel is then strained, 
seasoned with salt, and served very hot.

1 c. white sauce. 

Prepare carrots according to directions, cut into ^^ 
inch dice, boil until tender in salted water, drain, and 
serve in white sauce. 

Young carrots will cook in twenty to thirty minutes; 
the older ones will require one hour. 

Green Peas 

Prepare peas as directed. Wash the pods carefully 
and boil in a small quantity of water. Cook the peas 
in this water. 



32 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

If young and fresh, the peas will cook in thirty 
minutes; when old, allow forty-five to sixty minutes. 
Drain, season with salt and butter, and serve. If de- 
sired, the liquid may be thickened like a white sauce 
and the peas served in this. 

Always save the liquid in which peas have been 
cooked, as it may be used in soups. 



SERVICE 
The Breakfast Table 

Arrange cups and saucers, creamer and sugar bowl, in 
front of the hostess. A coffee-stand should be placed 
at the right of the hostess for the coffee-pot. 

All heavy dishes are placed in front of the host, so 
that he may serve. 

With fruit, finger bowls should be used. 

The Dinner Table 

The carving set and knife and fork rests should be 
laid in front of the host. The host serves the fish and 
meat. 

The soup ladle should be placed in front of the host- 
ess, handle to the right. The hostess should serve the 
soup, salad, dessert, and coffee, and usually the vege- 
tables. 

The soup spoons should be placed at the right of 
the knives at each place, bowls up. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 33 

Rules for Serving 

Cold food should be served on cold dishes, hot food 
on hot dishes. 

Never fill glasses or cups more than three-fourths 
full. Fill before each course. 

Do not let the table become disorderly during the 
meal. 

When passing a dish, hold it so that the thmnb will 
not rest upon the upper surface. 

The waitress should stand at the back of the hostess, 
or while the meat is being carved, at the back of the 
host. She should take each plate from the left as it is 
ready to serve, in her right hand, and place it before 
the person for whom it is intended. Everything is 
served at the left, except liquids in glasses, or cups and 
saucers. 

In passing dishes from which a person is to help 
himself, pass always to the left side, so that the food 
may be taken with the right hand. 

All soiled dishes should be removed from the left. 
The waitress should never pile one dish upon another. 

When one course is finished, soiled dishes should be 
removed first, then food, then clean dishes, then 
crumbs. 

When folding the tablecloth or napkins always fold 
very carefully in the same creases. 



PART n 



EGGS 

Eggs are a tissue-building food, the chief protein 
being a form of albumen. In food value and in digesti- 
bility they compare favorably with meat, and during 
the spring and summer should be freely used. 

When an egg is perfectly fresh it will sink to the 
bottom of a brine made in the proportion of two ounces 
of salt to one pint of water; if stale, the egg will float 
upon the surface. If a stale egg is shaken gently it will 
give a rattling sound. 

Soft-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 6 to 8 m. 

ft 

Hard-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 40 to 45 m. 

[ Poached Eggs on Toast 

Have a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling, salted 
water, allowing 1 tsp. salt to 1 pt. water. Put a slightly 
buttered muffin-ring in the water. 



38 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Break egg carefully into a cup and slip into muffin- 
ring. The water should cover the egg.

General Rules for Custards 

When using milk and eggs together in cooking, cook 
them at a low temperature. Soft custards should be 
cooked in a double boiler. Baked custards should be 
set in a pan of hot water while baking. 

When putting hot milk and cold ^gg together, pour 
the milk on the ^%% very slowly, while stirring. 

Stir a soft custard all the time while cooking, and 
when done take out of the hot water immediately. 

Should the custard curdle, place the saucepan in cold 
water and beat the custard with a Dover egg-beater. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 41 

A soft custard is done when it forms a coating on a 
spoon. 

A baked custard is done when a silver knife inserted 
in the custard comes out clean.

Yolks of 2 eggs. 3^ tsp. vanilla. 

}4: cÂ» sugar. 

Heat the milk in a double boiler. Beat the egg yolk 
slightly, add the sugar and salt. 

Pour the hot milk over this mixture, stirring until 
the egg is all removed from the sides of the bowl. 

Return to the double boiler, and cook until a 
coating is formed. Strain the custard and, when cool, 
flavor. 

Three egg yolks must be used if the custard is not to 
be used as a sauce. 

Baked Custards 

2 c. milk. yi c sugar. 

3 eggs. }/i tsp. salt. 
1 tsp. vanilla or a little grated nutmeg.

MILK 
Signs of Good Milk 

There should be no sediment of dirt after standing. 
There should be about one-sixth the total depth of 
cream â€” the narrowing neck of the bottle may make it 
seem even more. The milk should keep sweet twenty- 
four hours, and when it tastes sour it should separate 
into curds and whey, not be simply a uniform white 
mass, as is likely to happen when soda is used to keep 
it." 1 



Â«i 



Cottage Cheese 

Heat thick, sour milk over hot water until the whey 
separates. Place in cheesecloth and let drain until no 
whey remains. Salt to taste, adding a little cream to 
give the right consistency. Shape into balls of the de- 
sired size. 

Butter 

Use thick, sour cream. If a large amount, place in 
churn; if small, beat with spoon or egg-beater. When 
small globules of butter have formed, drain ofif the

CREAM SOUPS 

Cream soups are a combination of strained, cooked 
vegetable pulp and white sauce; sometimes a small 
amount of white stock is also used. The proportions 
are equal parts of pulp and white sauce. The vegetables 



44 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

generally used are peas, beans, com, asparagus, celery, 
and potatoes. 

Usually the vegetable is cooked in a small quantity 
of water, and this is mixed with the pulp before meas- 
uring and adding to the white sauce, but with potatoes 
the water is not used. 

The amount of starch in the vegetable used will make 
it necessary for more or less flour to be used in the 
white sauce; the final consistency of the soup should 
be that of good cream. If the soup stands any length 
of time it will become too thick, but may be thinned 
with hot milk. Allow one cup of soup for each person 
when planning your meal. 

Potato Soup 

1 c. potatoes. 3 tbsp. butter. 

3 c. milk. 2 tbsp. flour. 

1 c. water. )^ tsp. salt. 

1 stalk celery. Spk. pepper.

together 20 m. in double boiler. Add to potato, thicken 
as for white sauce, strain, and serve at once. 

Mock Bisque Soup 

2 c. milk. 3 tbsp. butter.

MEAT 

The most important of the protein foods are found 
among the different varieties of meat. All meat is 
composed of water, protein and fat, the proportions of 
each varying in different cuts from the same animal, 
and in different animals. 

Beef is more commonly used than any other meat. 
It is best when taken from a young, full-grown animal, 
four to eight years old. The lean meat should be firm 
yet juicy, and should turn a bright red when cut. The 
fat should be generous in amount, creamy white in 
color, and firm to the touch. 

Next to beef, in importance, stands mutton; this, 
like beef, is found in the market the year round, and, 
if the sheep be not more than three or four years old, 
is good. The lean meat should be bright red in color, 
fine grained and juicy. The fat, however, is stronger 
in taste, whiter in color, harder in appearance, and less 
digestible than beef fat. 

Veal, lamb, and pork are less digestible than beef 
and mutton and require more thorough cooking. 

Poultry includes all domestic fowls; it is more expen- 
sive than the varieties of meat already mentioned, and 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 47 

likewise contains less nourishment, but the flavor is 
usually more delicate. 

Game includes all varieties of wild animals used as 
food, such as venison, bear, partridge, quail, rabbits, 
wild turkeys, and squirrel.

FISH 

Fish stands next to eggs and meat as a protein food. 
All fish may be divided into three classes â€” white fish, 
oily fish, shellfish. The oily fish are the richest in ex- 
tractives and fat, but are less easily digested than the 
white fish. 

Only fresh fish should be purchased; if good, the 
flesh will be firm and plump, the gills red, and the eyes 
bright.

head the list. This form of protein is not so easily 
digested, nor is it so thoroughly assimilated by the 
system, and it would be very unwise to use it commonly, 
but occasionally it is most acceptable. 

We may serve plain boiled lima beans, Boston baked 
beans, or bean soup; but with many the Spanish beans 
will prove to be the most appetizing. 

Spanish Beans 

2 tbsp. vinegar. Salt to taste. 

1 onion. 1 spk. cayenne. 

2 tbsp. sugar. 2 c. tomato. 

1 pt. pink beans. J^ of a red pepper. 

4 tbsp. butter.

1. Soak the beans over night; boil in salted water 
until tender. 

2. Change the water three times during cooking. Be 
sure to add boiling water each time. 

3. Remove two-thirds of the beans. 

4. Add remaining materials, with exception of 
salt and butter, to beans left in kettle, and boil 

5. Press these beans, with the onion, etc., through a 
sieve; add the water they were boiled in. 

6. Pour this mixture over the whole beans, heat 
again, adding 4 tbsp. butter, and salt to taste. 

Note. â€” A 2-in. piece of fat salt pork may be boiled 
with the beans, and less butter used. 



Lima Beans 

1 pt. dried Lima beans. 

Pick over carefully, wash, soak in cold water over 
night. Place in fresh boiling water and cook gently 1

HOUSEKEEPING 
Laundiy Work 

When preparing for laundry work, sort out the clothes 
carefully, remove stains, prepare the first water, and 
place the more delicate articles in it. If the water is 
liard, soften by the use of a very little soda water (sal 
soda dissolved in hot water) or borax water. Vary the 
amount of soap according to the kind used. Soak all 
white clothes for an hour or more before washing; 
wash the delicate articles without rubbing; put clothes 
through five waters, if possible. Make bluing water 
the shade of the clear sky at the zenith. 

Set the color in delicate fabrics. Sugar of lead is 
good for blues. Use 1 oz. to 1 gal. of water, and 
soak 1 h. (Remember that this is a poison and keep 
it on a high shelf, plainly marked.) Ordinary colors 
will do well with salt in the rinsing-water after the 
first time; allow 1 tbsp. salt to 1 qt. of water. Vine- 
gar is often used for lavender and purple; the propor- 
tion is the same as salt. Alum is good for green; the 
proportion is the same. 

When possible, boil all white clothes, using a small 
amount of soap in the water. 

Hot starch should be used generally for all clothes 
that are to be stiffened. Use 

1 tbsp. starch. J^ tsp. borax. 



A HANDBOOK ^OF<HOME ECONOMICS 63 

Mix with a little cold water and stir in boiling water 
until transparent. 

Flannel and silk should be washed in warm, soapy- 
water (Wool Soap or Ivory Soap will give good results), 
rinsed carefully in water of the same temperature, and 
hung to dry immediately. (Always wash these by hand, 
without using the washboard.) Iron the silk before it 
is fully dry, but allow the flannel to dry thoroughly. 
Very soft silk may be dipped in water in which gum 
arabic has been dissolved. Mix 1 oz. of gum with 1 pt. 
of hot water, strain through a cloth, and use 2 tsp. to 
1 c. of water. 



To Remove Stains 

Tea or Coffee. â€” Rinse well and pour boiling water 
over the stain. 

Chocolate, â€” Sprinkle with powdered borax and soak 
well in cold water. Add boiling water. 

Fruit â€” Dip into Javelle water and rinse thor- 
oughly, or treat like tea stains. 

Ink. â€” Soak two or three hours in coal oil, remove 
and wash in strong soap-suds, or rub with lemon juice 
and salt. 

CaUa lily. â€” Nothing satisfactory; try anunonia 
several times. 

MUk. â€” Wash quickly in cold water. 

Scorch. â€” Hang in sun and try soap solution. 

Grass. â€” Wash in alcohol and rub well. 



64 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Paint. â€” Rub with benzine or turpentine. 

Blood. â€” Soak in cold water until stain turns brown, 
then wash in warm water and soap. 

Mildew. â€” Rub lemon juice upon the spots and place 
in sunshine. Salt may also be used. 

Iron Rust. â€” Spread carefully over bowl in which 
you have placed J^ tsp. borax and 1 pt. water. Drop 
by drop apply acid until the stain brightens; then dip 
directly in water. Repeat if necessary. It is often 
wise to add ammonia to the rinsing water. 



Javelle Water 

4 lbs. washing soda. 
4 qts. boiling water. 
1 lb. chloride of lime. 

Dissolve soda in water in agate or granite-ware 
kettle, boil 10 m., stir in the lime gradually. When 
cold, strain through cloth and place in bottles. For 
ordinary bleaching, use 1 c. to 8 qts. of water. Do not 
leave in the water over 5 m.

BATTERS 

Any mixture of flour and liquid thin enough to be 
beaten is called a batter. Batter may be divided into 
three classes, â€” thin, thick, and drop-batters. 

The proportions for the thin batters are equal parts 
of flour and liquid. 

The proportions for the thick batter are twice as 
much flour as liquid. 

A drop-batter requires enough flour to cause it to 
fall readily from the spoon. 

Popovers

BREAD 

In our work with marmalade we have been very 
careful to destroy anything that might cause fermenta- 
tion in our finished product. Now we are going to work 
with just the opposite idea in mind. Our earlier lessons 
in doughs have been where the carbon dioxide was 
quickly formed and quickly escaped. ^Vhen we study 
bread, we find that even the quickest process requires 
several hours, and frequently six to eight horn's pass 
before the finished loaves come from the oven. 

The foundation of good bread is good flour and good 
yeast; let either of these be poor and the result is a 
partial failure. By good yeast is meant fresh, pure 
yeast which will grow rapidly and help to produce the 
carbon dioxide we want, and only that. Yeast is a tiny 
plant that grows very rapidly but cannot be seen with- 
out a microscope; to develop thus rapidly it must have 
a warm, not hot, atmosphere, with plenty of food and 
drink. As it grows in the dough it splits up the sugar 
in the mixture, and from this comes the carbon dioxide 
which makes the bread light. A certain amount of 
alcohol is also thrown ofT, but this escapes before the 
bread is thoroughly baked. 

Remember first the three necessary ingredients in 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 79 

good bread: good flour, good yeast, milk or water; then 
the three accessories which are added to make it taste 
better: sugar, salt, shortening. 

The kneading is necessary to make the gluten elastic, 
for without this we could not have spongy bread. If 
possible, let this be done in the home with the bread- 
mixer, leaving the hand-kneading to the end of the 
process when the dough is shaped into loaves. 

Bread Made with Milk or Water 

2 c. boiling water, or 1 tbsp. sugar. 

1 c. milk and 1 c. water. J^ tbsp. salt. 
1 tbsp. butter. J^ yeast cake. 

1 tbsp. lard. J^ c. lukewarm water. 

About 6 c. sifted floiu'. 

Place shortening, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, pour 
in the boiling water, or boiling water and scalded milk. 

When the mixture is blood warm, add the dissolved 
yeast cake and 5 c. floiu'. Stir till thoroughly mixed, 
using a knife or wooden spoon. 

Add remaining flour, mix, turn on a floured board, 
leaving a clean bowl. Knead until the mixtiu^e is 
smooth and elastic to the touch, and bubbles may be 
seen under the surface. 

Return to the bowl, cover with a clean cloth and a 
board or tin cover, let it rise over night in a tempera- 
ture of 65Â° F. Or, use a whole yeast cake and let it rise 
for 2 or 3 h., or until 2}/^ times its original size. 



80 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Turn on floured board, knead, shape in loaves or bis- 
cuits, place in greased pans, having the pans nearly full. 

Let the dough rise to double its size, and bake in a

THE CARE OF THE BEDROOM 

The only room in which we are likely to pass six to 
ten hours daily, without any change, is our sleeping- 
room. No other room in the whole house should be 
more carefully selected or better ventilated than this. 
The best of all is to sleep out of doors, but only a 
few can do this, and we must try to make the air 
in oiu* rooms as much like outdoor air as we possibly 
can. 

In selecting oiu' sleeping-room let us have a simny 
exposiu^, with windows, if possible, on two sides, and 
the space so planned that a bed may fit in without 
standing in front of one window. If we can, let us 
have a hardwood floor, or a painted one, with a few 
rugs that can be easily cleaned; if this is not possible, 
the floor may be covered with a* good matting. The 
fiu'nishings should be light, simple, and such as may 
be easily cleaned. The walls should be of soft tone, 
and the curtains light, so that the air will pass through 
readily. 

For the bed itself select a light brass or iron frame 
and put all the money you can afford into your mat- 
tress. Whatever kind you select, let it be the best 
possible, but not too soft. Be sure that the spring is 
firm; where this gives too much one does not rest so well. 
Cover the mattress with a case of unbleached muslin 
that can be easily removed and laundered, and place 
a thin washable pad under the sheet. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 83 

Let the sheets be long enough to tuck in securely at 
the bottom and turn over well at the top, and make 
them of firm, well-woven sheeting. Choose several 
light-weight covers rather than one heavy one, using 
blankets whenever you can afford them â€” wool blank- 
ets, or those that are three-quarters wool. 

Let the spread be simple and light and easily laun- 
dered, and make the pillow-slips long enough to really 
cover the pillows.

SALADS 

There is no line of cookery in which more care and 
study are required to gain the best results than in salad- 
making. Yet, when understood, nothing is more simple. 



84 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Certain things are essential to success â€” such as crisp 
lettuce, good olive oil, a well-made dressing, fresh fruits 
and vegetables, well-prepared meat and fish. 

All lettuce must be well washed, the leaves dried in 
a soft cloth, then placed close to the ice in a cheese- 
cloth, or, if nothing else is at hand, a paper bag. The 
uncooked vegetables must be tender and thoroughly 
chilled; the cooked vegetables cut into attractive shapes, 
when desired, and then kept unbroken; fish should be 
freed from all skin and bone and separated into distinct 
flakes; meat must be diced after being freed from bone, 
fat, and all gristle. 

When using cooked vegetables, or meat and fish, 
mix the French dressing with the prepared ingredients 
a half hour or more before serving. The best result is 
obtained by mixing each kind separately, putting to- 
gether just before serving. 

Always try to make the salad dainty and attractive 
when serving. If in individual form, shape the lettuce 
leaves into cup shapes, and garnish â€” where possible â€” 
with some special vegetables, or with olives. 

Remember that the simpler salad-dressings are the 
more wholesome, and should be the ones most com- 
monly used. 

French Dressing

1 tbsp. vinegar or lemon juice. J^ tsp. salt. 

3 tbsp. olive oil. Spk. pepper.

FROZEN DISHES 

Some of our best and simplest desserts are the sher- 
bets, ices, and creams. An ice is simply fruit juice, 
water, and sugar, frozen together. A sherbet is, usu- 
ally, the same as an ice with the addition of stiff egg 
whites. A cream should be pure cream, flavoring, and 
sugar, or a rich custard with cream added, in equal 
quantities. This last combination is the richest of aD. 

In packing the freezer use three parts of ice to one of 
salt. See that the crank works easily before beginning 
to pack, and test occasionally while filling with the ice 
and salt. Do not fill the can more than two-thirds full 
of the ice cream or sherbet, otherwise it will run over 
before it is frozen. Turn very slowly at first, stopping 
once or twice; when too hard to turn, remove dasher, 
pack down, cover closely, repack with salt and ice, and 
allow it to stand several hours to harden. 

Fruit Sherbet 

3 oranges. 3 c. sugar. 

3 lemons. 3 c. water. 

1 banana. 2 egg whites. 

J^ can apricots.

PREFACE 

THE plan in this little book has been to give a simple 
basis for the pupil to work from, leaving the teacher 
free to present the lesson in her own way. The princi- 
pal points to be brought out are suggested by the 
questions at the end of each lesson. These questions 
are to be answered by the pupil in the spare moments 
which are so often wasted in the course of an ordinary 
cookery period. 

This course may be completed in one school year, 
or in two, according to the frequency of the lessons. 
The book is divided into two parts for the convenience 
of classes which devote two years to the subject.

PART I 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME 
ECONOMICS 

SUGGESTIONS FOR HOUSEKEEPING 

Let each pupil provide herself with two large, plain, 
white aprons made from cambric, long cloth, or linen; 
avoid lawn because it wears so short a time and rumples 
so easily. In addition to the aprons, every girl should 
have her own small hand- towel and cookery holder; the 
towel need not be more than eighteen inches long, and 
the holder should not be over five inches square. 

When working in the cookery room, keep the wrists 
free from bracelets and the fingers free from rings; let 
the hair be neat and away from the face. 

Before beginning the lesson see that the hands are 
thoroughly washed and the nails well cleaned. Keep 
the hand-towel fastened at the waist, ready for imme- 
diate use. 

When the lesson is over, fold both apron and towel 
neatly and place in the locker assigned. Before leav- 
ing the class-room be sure that all utensils are in perfect 
order and, if possible, that your notes are all placed in 
your text-book. 



4' ; A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Dish-Washing 

Clean all plates and dishes; if they are greasy, use 
brown paper; if not, scrape with a rubber scraper or 
with a case-knife. 

Arrange neatly and in the most convenient manner. 
Use hot, soapy water, filling the dishpan about one- 
third full. Change the water frequently if many dishes 
are to be washed. Rinse all dishes with clear, hot 
water and wipe with clean towels free from lint. 

Wash glassware first. If an extra polish is desired, 
wipe from the soapy water. 

After the glassware, wash the silver, then the china, 
and then the cooking utensils. 

Take fresh, hot water and wash the towels thor- 
oughly, rinse in clear water, stretch carefully and hang 
to dry; fold the dishcloth evenly and hang to dry. 

Be very careful to keep bone, ivory, or wooden handles 
of knives or forks out of the water, and make sure, 
when washing a Dover egg-beater, that only the part 
below the wheel touches the water. 

If a saucepan has become burned place a few tea- 
spoons of baking soda in the pan, fill with warm water 
and let it stand for several hours or over night.

FOOD 

The food which we eat may be divided into three 
distinct classes: proteins, carbohydrates, fats. These 
will be studied in detail as we advance in the work. 
Try to remember now that protein foods are the chief 
sources of tissue and muscle, and that the carbohydrates 
and fats give us energy and fat. 

MILK 

The first food that children take is milk, and for the 
young child this seems an almost perfect food. Since 
all young children must live on it, it is necessary for 
us to know how to tell good milk and how to care for 
it. It is very difficult to get fresh, pure milk in the 
large cities, and nothing that comes into the house 
requires more care. 

Care of Milk 

Select the best dairy you can find. Wipe milk bottles 
when brought into the house. Place in refrigerator or 
cold closet. If turned from bottles, place in glass, agate- 
ware, earthenware, granite, or aluminum, and keep 
covered. If doubtful about the purity, scald. To 
scald the milk, heat over hot water; when a bead-like 
ring forms around the edge, it is scalded. Remove 
directly. Greater heat makes the milk less digestible.

HOUSEKEEPING 
Care of Refrigerator 

Look over the refrigerator daily to see that no food 
is left to spoil. Food with a strong flavor, or hot food, 
should not be put into the refrigerator. 

Once a week every part of the refrigerator should be 
washed with a solution of washing-soda, a dish mop 
being used. Rinse, wipe as dry as possible, and air 
thoroughly before using again. Flush the waste-pipe 
with the soda solution. 

Care of the Sink 

Always pour dishwater through a sink strainer, and 
put the refuse left in strainer in garbage pail. 

When dish-washing is finished, wash every part of 
the sink and sink strainer with hot, soapy water. Wash 
above and around the sink, and use a scrubbing brush 
and a skewer when necessary. 

Flush the sink with boiling water every day, and 
about once a week with a strong, hot solution of washing- 
soda. (Cover 1 c. washing-soda with 6 qts. boiling 
water and let remain on the fire until all the soda is 
dissolved. Pour this, boiling hot, into the pipes, using 
2 to 3 qts. for each sink.) 

Garbage 

Garbage should be burned, or should be put into 
large pails to be collected several times a week. These 



18 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

garbage pails should be cleaned thoroughly with the 
hose, after emptying, and dried well in the sun. When 
necessary, a strong, hot solution of washing-soda should 
be used to clean them. 

Scraps in the kitchen should be put into a granite- 
ware pail. This scrap pail should be emptied into the 
garbage pail every day. It should be washed as any 
other dish and thoroughly dried. Once a week it should 
be washed with the soda solution. 

Care of the Range 

When grease or other material is spilled on the range 
while cooking is being done, rub off at once with paper. 

Beside cleaning out the ashes from the range every 
day, the space above and below the oven should be 
cleaned out about once a month, as the soot and ashes 
collected there prevent the proper heating of the oven. 

Never blacken the range without cleaning it first. 
Moisten some stove polish with cold water and rub it 
over the range with a brush or cloth. Blacken when 
stove is cold. 

Use a dry brush for polishing, rubbing very briskly. 
Begin at front of range when the stove is warm. 

To Clean Metals 

Always wash articles carefully before cleaning. After 
cleaning, wash in hot water containing ammonia, and 
dry carefully. The following cleansing agents may be 
used: 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 19 

Tin. Sapolio or silver-polish; whiting, moistened 
with ammonia, alcohol, or water.

CEREALS 

The most important cereal food products are those 
prepared from wheat, corn, rice, and oats. 

Composition 

"Cereals contain all the food principles; they aver- 
age about two-thirds carbohydrates, one-tenth protein, 
one-tenth water, and they contain a little fat and min- 
eral matter." 



22 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS

Gruels 

In many cases of sickness the patient is unable to 
take any solid food, and a gruel is prescribed by the 
physician. This is nothing but a cereal cooked with a 
much larger proportion of water; usually we use one 
tablespoonf ul of the cereal to one cup of water or milk, 
and cook very thoroughly. The gruel is then strained, 
seasoned with salt, and served very hot.

Rules for Serving 

Cold food should be served on cold dishes, hot food 
on hot dishes. 

Never fill glasses or cups more than three-fourths 
full. Fill before each course. 

Do not let the table become disorderly during the 
meal. 

When passing a dish, hold it so that the thumb will 
not rest upon the upper surface. 

The waitress should stand at the back of the hostess, 
or while the meat is being carved, at the back of the 
host. She should take each plate from the left as it is 
ready to serve, in her right hand, and place it before 
the person for whom it is intended. Everything is 
served at the left, except liquids in glasses, or cups and 
saucers. 

In passing dishes from which a person is to help 
himself, pass always to the left side, so that the food 
may be taken with the right hand. 

All soiled dishes should be removed from the left. 
The waitress should never pile one dish upon another. 

When one course is finished, soiled dishes should be 
removed first, then food, then clean dishes, then 
crumbs. 

When folding the tablecloth or napkins always fold 
very carefully in the same creases. 



PART II 



EGGS 

Eggs are a tissue-building food, the chief protein 
being a form of albumen. In food value and in digesti- 
bility they compare favorably with meat, and during 
the spring and summer should be freely used. 

When an egg is perfectly fresh it will sink to the 
bottom of a brine made in the proportion of two ounces 
of salt to one pint of water; if stale, the egg will float 
upon the surface. If a stale egg is shaken gently it will 
give a rattling sound. 

Soft-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 6 to 8 m. 

Hard-cooked Eggs 

Place egg in stewpan of boiling water, using a spoon. 
Cover closely and place where water will keep hot, but 
where it will not boil. Cook 40 to 45 m. 

Poached Eggs on Toast 

Have a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling, salted 
water, allowing 1 tsp. salt to 1 pt. water. Put a slightly 
buttered muffin-ring in the water. 



38 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Break egg carefully into a cup and slip into muffin- 
ring. The water should cover the egg. 

When there is a film on top, and the white is firm, 
carefully take up ring and egg with a buttered griddle- 
cake turner and place egg on a circular piece of buttered 
toast.

Scrambled Eggs 

4 eggs. J^ tsp. salt. 

2 tbsp. milk. Spk. pepper. 

J/2 tbsp. butter. 

Beat eggs slightly with a fork, add milk and season- 
ing. Melt butter in saucepan, turn in the egg mixture, 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 39 

and stir over a slow fire until it begins to set. Remove 
from fire and cook over hot water until firm, but not 
hard. Serve at once on slices of buttered toast. 



Light Omelet 

2 eggs. y% tsp. salt. 

1 tsp. butter. 1 spk. pepper. 

2 tbsp. water. 

Separate yolk from white of eggs. Beat yolks until 
light and creamy, add salt, pepper, and water. Beat 
whites until stiff, cut, and fold them into the yolks. 

Heat omelet pan, and butter sides and bottom. Turn 
in the mixture, spread evenly, place where it will cook 
slowly, occasionally turning the pan that omelet may 
brown evenly. 

When omelet is well risen and delicately browned 
underneath, place pan on oven grate to finish cooking. 
Fold and turn upon a hot platter. 

French Omelet 
3 eggs. y^ tsp. salt. Spk. pepper. 

Beat the eggs, with the seasoning, just enough to 
break the yolks. Melt ^ tsp. butter in a frying-pan. 
Turn in the egg mixture, and with a fork lift the cooked 
portions of the egg, allowing the liquid on top to run 
down underneath. When the egg is cooked, but still 
quite soft on top, slip the knife underneath and roll 



40 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

the omelet to the center. Let it cook for a moment, 
then turn upon a hot platter. Serve at once. 



Estimate cost of each recipe and note the number of 
people it will serve. 

Egg Vermicelli

and pour over the toasted bread. 

Press the yolks through a strainer and sprinkle over 
the top. 

General Rules for Custards 

When using milk and eggs together in cooking, cook 
them at a low temperature. Soft custards should be 
cooked in a double boiler. Baked custards should be 
set in a pan of hot water while baking. 

When putting hot milk and cold egg together, pour 
the milk on the egg very slowly, while stirring. 

Stir a soft custard all the time while cooking, and 
when done take out of the hot water immediately. 

Should the custard curdle, place the saucepan in cold 
water and beat the custard with a Dover egg-beater. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 41 

A soft custard is done when it forms a coating on a 
spoon. 

A baked custard is done when a silver knife inserted 
in the custard comes out clean. 



Custard Sauce 

c. milk. Y% tsp. salt. 

Yolks of 2 eggs. J^ tsp. vanilla. 

J4 c. sugar. 

Heat the milk in a double boiler. Beat the egg yolk 
slightly, add the sugar and salt. 

Pour the hot milk over this mixture, stirring until 
the egg is all removed from the sides of the bowl. 

Return to the double boiler, and cook until a 
coating is formed. Strain the custard and, when cool, 
flavor. 

Three egg yolks must be used if the custard is not to 
be used as a sauce. 

Baked Custards 

2 c. milk. J4 c - sugar. 

3 eggs. y% tsp. salt. 
1 tsp. vanilla or a little grated nutmeg. 

Beat the eggs and sugar together until light. Add 
milk and vanilla. Pour into buttered custard cups. 
Stand in pan of hot water. 

Bake in oven until custards are firm in the middle. 
Turn out when cold.

MILK 
Signs of Good Milk 

"There should be no sediment of dirt after standing. 
There should be about one-sixth the total depth of 
cream the narrowing neck of the bottle may make it 
seem even more. The milk should keep sweet twenty- 
four hours, and when it tastes sour it should separate 
into curds and whey, not be simply a uniform white 
mass, as is likely to happen when soda is used to keep 
it." l 

Cottage Cheese 

Heat thick, sour milk over hot water until the whey 
separates. Place in cheesecloth and let drain until no 
whey remains. Salt to taste, adding a little cream to 
give the right consistency. Shape into balls of the de- 
sired size. 

Butter 

Use thick, sour cream. If a large amount, place in 
churn; if small, beat with spoon or egg-beater. When 
small globules of butter have formed, drain off the

buttermilk, wash in clear, cold water, salt to taste, and 
shape in rolls or balls. 

Junket or Thick Milk 

1 qt. milk. 2 tbsp. cold water. 

1 junket tablet. }/ c. sugar. 

Flavoring: vanilla, nutmeg. 
(1 tbsp. liquid rennet may be used instead of junket.) 

Place the milk in double boiler and warm it. Do 
not let it become hot. 

Add the rennet dissolved in the cold water, and stir. 
Add flavoring. 

Keep in a warm place till thick. Then set in a cool 
place, taking care not to shake it. 

Serve cold with a custard sauce.

CREAM SOUPS 

Cream soups are a combination of strained, cooked 
vegetable pulp and white sauce; sometimes a small 
amount of white stock is also used. The proportions 
are equal parts of pulp and white sauce. The vegetables 



44 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

generally used are peas, beans, corn, asparagus, celery, 
and potatoes. 

Usually the vegetable is cooked in a small quantity 
of water, and this is mixed with the pulp before meas- 
uring and adding to the white sauce, but with potatoes 
the water is not used. 

The amount of starch in the vegetable used will make 
it necessary for more or less flour to be used in the 
white sauce; the final consistency of the soup should 
be that of good cream. If the soup stands any length 
of time it will become too thick, but may be thinned 
with hot milk. Allow one cup of soup for each person 
when planning your meal. 

Potato Soup 

1 c. potatoes. 3 tbsp. butter. 

3 c. milk. 2 tbsp. flour. 

1 c. water. J^ tsp. salt. 

1 stalk celery. Spk. pepper. 

J4 onion. Spk. celery salt. 

Boil potatoes, and mash. Cook milk, celery, and onion 
together 20 m. in double boiler. Add to potato, thicken 
as for white sauce, strain, and serve at once. 

Mock Bisque Soup 

2 c. milk. 3 tbsp. butter. 

3 tbsp. flour. Spk. pepper. 

2 c. tomato juice. J^ tsp. baking soda. 
Yz tsp. salt. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 45 

Combine milk, butter, flour, salt, and pepper as for 
white sauce. Heat tomato and stir in soda, let the

1 pt. canned corn. }/2 tsp. salt. 

1 pt. white sauce (thin). J/ tsp. pepper. 
% tsp. celery salt. 

Cook corn and water fifteen minutes. Strain. Cook 
the onion in the milk, in a double boiler, before making 
the white sauce. Add the strained corn pulp and sea- 
soning to white sauce, and serve. 

Tomato Soup 

1 pt. strained tomato juice. 

1 pt. water in which peas and pea pods have been 
cooked. 

1 tbsp. onion. 

2 tbsp. butter. 

3 tbsp. flour.

MEAT 

The most important of the protein foods are found 
among the different varieties of meat. All meat is 
composed of water, protein and fat, the proportions of 
each varying in different cuts from the same animal, 
and in different animals. 

Beef is more commonly used than any other meat. 
It is best when taken from a young, full-grown animal, 
four to eight years old. The lean meat should be firm 
yet juicy, and should turn a bright red when cut. The 
fat should be generous in amount, creamy white in 
color, and firm to the touch. 

Next to beef, in importance, stands mutton; this, 
like beef, is found in the market the year round, and, 
if the sheep be not more than three or four years old, 
is good. The lean meat should be bright red in color, 
fine grained and juicy. The fat, however, is stronger 
in taste, whiter in color, harder in appearance, and less 
digestible than beef fat. 

Veal, lamb, and pork are less digestible than beef 
and mutton and require more thorough cooking. 

Poultry includes all domestic fowls; it is more expen- 
sive than the varieties of meat already mentioned, and 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 47 

likewise contains less nourishment, but the flavor is 
usually more delicate. 

Game includes all varieties of wild animals used as 
food, such as venison, bear, partridge, quail, rabbits, 
wild turkeys, and squirrel.

FISH 

Fish stands next to eggs and meat as a protein food. 
All fish may be divided into three classes white fish, 
oily fish, shellfish. The oily fish are the richest in ex- 
tractives and fat, but are less easily digested than the 
white fish. 

Only fresh fish should be purchased; if good, the 
flesh will be firm and plump, the gills red, and the eyes 
bright.

Fried Fish 

Clean the fish and wipe as dry as possible. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, roll in flour, then dip in white 
of egg and roll in bread crumbs or corn meal. 

Put into a frying-pan 2 tbsp. of fat which must 
become very hot before the fish is put in. Turn the 
fish with a broad knife or pancake turner, with care 
not to break the fish.

BEANS 

Sometimes we cannot obtain either meat or fish, or 
we do not care to serve animal food, yet we must have 
our protein in some form. Then we find that certain 
vegetables will work in very well, and peas and beans 
head the list. This form of protein is not so easily 
digested, nor is it so thoroughly assimilated by the 
system, and it would be very unwise to use it commonly, 
but occasionally it is most acceptable. 

We may serve plain boiled lima beans, Boston baked 
beans, or bean soup; but with many the Spanish beans 
will prove to be the most appetizing.

HOUSEKEEPING 
Laundry Work 

When preparing for laundry work, sort out the clothes 
carefully, remove stains, prepare the first water, and 
place the more delicate articles in it. If the water is 
hard, soften by the use of a very little soda water (sal 
soda dissolved in hot water) or borax water. Vary the 
amount of soap according to the kind used. Soak all 
white clothes for an hour or more before washing; 
wash the delicate articles without rubbing; put clothes 
through five waters, if possible. Make bluing water 
the shade of the clear sky at the zenith. 

Set the color in delicate fabrics. Sugar of lead is 
good for blues. Use 1 oz. to 1 gal. of water, and 
soak 1 h. (Remember that this is a poison and keep 
it on a high shelf, plainly marked.) Ordinary colors 
will do well with salt in the rinsing-water after the 
first time; allow 1 tbsp. salt to 1 qt. of water. Vine- 
gar is often used for lavender and purple; the propor- 
tion is the same as salt. Alum is good for green; the 
proportion is the same. 

When possible, boil all white clothes, using a small 
amount of soap in the water. 

Hot starch should be used generally for all clothes 
that are to be stiffened. Use 

1 tbsp. starch. J/4 tsp. borax. 



A HANDBOOK OF, HOME ECONOMICS 63 

Mix with a little cold water and stir in boiling water 
until transparent. 

Flannel and silk should be washed in warm, soapy 
water (Wool Soap or Ivory Soap will give good results), 
rinsed carefully in water of the same temperature, and 
hung to dry immediately. (Always wash these by hand, 
without using the washboard.) Iron the silk before it 
is fully dry, but allow the flannel to dry thoroughly. 
Very soft silk may be dipped in water in which gum 
arabic has been dissolved. Mix 1 oz. of gum with 1 pt. 
of hot water, strain through a cloth, and use 2 tsp. to 
1 c. of water. 



To Remove Stains 

Tea or Coffee. Rinse well and pour boiling water 
over the stain. 

Chocolate. Sprinkle with powdered borax and soak 
well in cold water. Add boiling water. 

Fruit. Dip into Javelle water and rinse thor- 
oughly, or treat like tea stains. 

Ink. Soak two or three hours in coal oil, remove 
and wash in strong soap-suds, or rub with lemon juice 
and salt. 

Calla lily. Nothing satisfactory; try ammonia 
several times. 

Milk. Wash quickly in cold water. 

Scorch. Hang in sun and try soap solution. 

Grass. Wash in alcohol and rub well. 



64 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Paint. Rub with benzine or turpentine. 

Blood. Soak in cold water until stain turns brown, 
then wash in warm water and soap. 

Mildew. Rub lemon juice upon the spots and place 
in sunshine. Salt may also be used. 

Iron Rust. Spread carefully over bowl in which 
you have placed % tsp. borax and 1 pt. water. Drop 
by drop apply acid until the stain brightens; then dip 
directly in water. Repeat if necessary. It is often 
wise to add ammonia to the rinsing water. 



Javelle Water 

4 Ibs. washing soda.

BATTERS 

Any mixture of flour and liquid thin enough to be 
beaten is called a batter. Batter may be divided into 
three classes, thin, thick, and drop-batters. 

The proportions for the thin batters are equal parts 
of flour and liquid. 

The proportions for the thick batter are twice as 
much flour as liquid. 

A drop-batter requires enough flour to cause it to 
fall readily from the spoon.

BREAD 

In our work with marmalade we have been very 
careful to destroy anything that might cause fermenta- 
tion in our finished product. Now we are going to work 
with just the opposite idea in mind. Our earlier lessons 
in doughs have been where the carbon dioxide was 
quickly formed and quickly escaped. When we study 
bread, we find that even the quickest process requires 
several hours, and frequently six to eight hours pass 
before the finished loaves come from the oven. 

The foundation of good bread is good flour and good 
yeast; let either of these be poor and the result is a 
partial failure. By good yeast is meant fresh, pure 
yeast which will grow rapidly and help to produce the 
carbon dioxide we want, and only that. Yeast is a tiny 
plant that grows very rapidly but cannot be seen with- 
out a microscope; to develop thus rapidly it must have 
a warm, not hot, atmosphere, with plenty of food and 
drink. As it grows in the dough it splits up the sugar 
in the mixture, and from this comes the carbon dioxide 
which makes the bread light. A certain amount of 
alcohol is also thrown off, but this escapes before the 
bread is thoroughly baked. 

Remember first the three necessary ingredients in 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 79 

good bread: good flour, good yeast, milk or water; then 
the three accessories which are added to make it taste 
better: sugar, salt, shortening. 

The kneading is necessary to make the gluten elastic, 
for without this we could not have spongy bread. If 
possible, let this be done in the home with the bread- 
mixer, leaving the hand-kneading to the end of the 
process when the dough is shaped into loaves. 

Bread Made with Milk or Water 

2 c. boiling water, or 1 tbsp. sugar. 

1 c. milk and 1 c. water. Y% tbsp. salt. 
1 tbsp. butter. % yeast cake. 

1 tbsp. lard. J4 c. lukewarm water. 

About 6 c. sifted flour. 

Place shortening, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, pour 
in the boiling water, or boiling water and scalded milk. 

When the mixture is blood warm, add the dissolved 
yeast cake and 5 c. flour. Stir till thoroughly mixed, 
using a knife or wooden spoon. 

Add remaining flour, mix, turn on a floured board, 
leaving a clean bowl. Knead until the mixture is 
smooth and elastic to the touch, and bubbles may be 
seen under the surface. 

Return to the bowl, cover with a clean cloth and a 
board or tin cover, let it rise over night in a tempera- 
ture of 65 F. Or, use a whole yeast cake and let it rise 
for 2 or 3 h., or until 2 3/2 times its original size.

Turn on floured board, knead, shape in loaves or bis- 
cuits, place in greased pans, having the pans nearly full. 

Let the dough rise to double its size, and bake in a

THE CARE OF THE BEDROOM 

The only room in which we are likely to pass six to 
ten hours daily, without any change, is our sleeping- 
room. No other room in the whole house should be 
more carefully selected or better ventilated than this. 
The best of all is to sleep out of doors, but only a 
few can do this, and we must try to make the air 
in our rooms as much like outdoor air as we possibly 
can. 

In selecting our sleeping-room let us have a sunny 
exposure, with windows, if possible, on two sides, and 
the space so planned that a bed may fit in without 
standing in front of one window. If we can, let us 
have a hardwood floor, or a painted one, with a few 
rugs that can be easily cleaned; if this is not possible, 
the floor may be covered with a good matting. The 
furnishings should be light, simple, and such as may 
be easily cleaned. The walls should be of soft tone, 
and the curtains light, so that the air will pass through 
readily. 

For the bed itself select a light brass or iron frame 
and put all the money you can afford into your mat- 
tress. Whatever kind you select, let it be the best 
possible, but not too soft. Be sure that the spring is 
firm; where this gives too much one does not rest so well. 
Cover the mattress with a case of unbleached muslin 
that can be easily removed and laundered, and place 
a thin washable pad under the sheet. 



A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 83 

Let the sheets be long enough to tuck in securely at 
the bottom and turn over well at the top, and make 
them of firm, well-woven sheeting. Choose several 
light-weight covers rather than one heavy one, using 
blankets whenever you can afford them wool blank- 
ets, or those that are three-quarters wool. 

Let the spread be simple and light and easily laun- 
dered, and make the pillow-slips long enough to really 
cover the pillows.

SALADS 

There is no line of cookery in which more care and 
study are required to gain the best results than in salad- 
making. Yet, when understood, nothing is more simple. 



84 A HANDBOOK OF HOME ECONOMICS 

Certain things are essential to success such as crisp 
lettuce, good olive oil, a well-made dressing, fresh fruits 
and vegetables, well-prepared meat and fish. 

All lettuce must be well washed, the leaves dried in 
a soft cloth, then placed close to the ice in a cheese- 
cloth, or, if nothing else is at hand, a paper bag. The 
uncooked vegetables must be tender and thoroughly 
chilled; the cooked vegetables cut into attractive shapes, 
when desired, and then kept unbroken; fish should be 
freed from all skin and bone and separated into distinct 
flakes; meat must be diced after being freed from bone, 
fat, and all gristle. 

When using cooked vegetables, or meat and fish, 
mix the French dressing with the prepared ingredients 
a half hour or more before serving. The best result is 
obtained by mixing each kind separately, putting to- 
gether just before serving. 

Always try to make the salad dainty and attractive 
when serving. If in individual form, shape the lettuce 
leaves into cup shapes, and garnish where possible 
with some special vegetables, or with olives. 

Remember that the simpler salad-dressings are the 
more wholesome, and should be the ones most com- 
monly used.

FROZEN DISHES 

Some of our best and simplest desserts are the sher- 
bets, ices, and creams. An ice is simply fruit juice, 
water, and sugar, frozen together. A sherbet is, usu- 
ally, the same as an ice with the addition of stiff egg 
whites. A cream should be pure cream, flavoring, and 
sugar, or a rich custard with cream added, in equal 
quantities. This last combination is the richest of all. 

In packing the freezer use three parts of ice to one of 
salt. See that the crank works easily before beginning 
to pack, and test occasionally while filling with the ice 
and salt. Do not fill the can more than two-thirds full 
of the ice cream or sherbet, otherwise it will run over 
before it is frozen. Turn very slowly at first, stopping 
once or twice; when too hard to turn, remove dasher, 
pack down, cover closely, repack with salt and ice, and 
allow it to stand several hours to harden. 

Fruit Sherbet 

3 oranges. 3 c. sugar. 

3 lemons. 3 c. water. 

1 banana. 2 egg whites. 

Yz can apricots.
