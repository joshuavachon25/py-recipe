Recipes contained in this little 
cook book have been carefully test- 
ed by me and are recommended for 
their wholesomeness, palatability 
and very moderate cost of materials. 
They certainly should help many a 
housewife to reduce her cost of 
living.

The Housewife's Problem 
in a Nutshell 



This little cook book is intended to help the 
frugal housewife to feed her family well. In 
these days of high cost of living this is not an easy 
problem. The woman who has a limited amount 
to spend on her table, must spend it wisely if the 
members of her household are to be well nourished 
and enjoy their food. 

True economy does not mean poor living. It 
means eliminating waste — getting the most for 
your money. It is quite possible to spend much 
and get little, in the way of wholesome food. 
Knowledge alone can save the housewife from such 
error. In the purchase and preparation of food 
she must know food values, how to get them at 
lowest cost, how to prepare them into appetizing 
dishes, how to save unnecessary waste. 

It may be poor economy to buy inexpensive 
food. The family must have certain elements to 
grow and work. Food may be cheap and worth- 
less, or inexpensive and valuable. One must 

7 



"know." It is really a simple matter to choose 
nutritious food, and have it so prepared that there 
is no waste. Waste is responsible for much of 
what we call ''high cost of living". Extravagance 
is evidenced not only by what people throw away, 
but also by what they leave in the shops because 
they do not know how to prepare it. Butchers put 
a high price on the cuts of meat which anybody 
can cook without loss of flavor. Parts requiring 
skill in preparation can be bought for much less. 

For health the human body requires proteids, 
carbohydrates, fats and mineral matter. The pro- 
teids are the muscle-builders. Meat is chief among 
them; hence it has a prominent place on our tables. 
Eggs, cheese, nuts and vegetables belonging to the 
pulse family (such as dried peas, beans and lentils) 
are all rich in proteid, and where economy is de- 
sired should often take the place of meat. The car- 
bohydrates are starches and sugars. These sub- 
stances furnish energy. They are found largely in 
cane sugar and the root vegetables, such as potatoes, 
beets, turnips, carrots, etc. White bread contains 
much starch, as do all the cereals. Fats and oils 
make heat and energy. They are found in cream, 
butter, oils, fat of meats, etc. The minerals have 
various uses, one of which is bone building. Green 
vegetables and grains supply them largely. 



No one food contains all of these valuable prop- 
erties. They usually are combined in varying pro- 
portions. Hence the need of a varied diet. A well 
planned meal includes foods from each of these 
large subdivisions, so insuring a full satisfaction 
of the body's needs. This is the reason why meat 
is served with potatoes and a green vegetable. 
Meat, or the proteid-bearing portion of the menu, 
is usually the most expensive. 

Food which is well cooked and contains suffi- 
cient variety of body building elements is certain 
to please the appetite. It is the ill nourished who 
crave other stimulants — or become tired of the 
menu. This is one cause of liquor drinking, espe- 
cially among men whose work is hard or heavy. 
Their food is insufficient or poorly balanced; it 
does not satisfy. A stronger stimulant is required, 
which, of course, is much more costly than any 
normal food. 

Every dollar saved on your food bill, without 
lessening food value or impairing its appetizing 
relish, is a dollar ahead. It will do you much 
more good in a savings bank earning interest than 
it will in being uselessly spent.

How to Prepare Inexpensive Cuts of Meat 

CHAPTER II 

When the housekeeper attempts to 
reduce her meat bill by using the less 
expensive cuts, she commonly has two 
difficulties to contend with: toughness 
and lack of flavor. These are readily 
overcome. Long cooking at moder- 
ate temperature softens the fibres, 
and pounding or chopping may be 
employed to break and cut the tough 
muscle. Proper cooking will develop 
natural flavor, which may also be en- 
riched by including vegetables and 
herbs with the meat. Directions follow 
herein for cooking some of the tough- 
est and cheapest cuts of meat so that 
they will be quite as nutritious as por- 
terhouse steak — and as appetizing. 

Hamburg steak may be made into 
dishes both appetizing and attractive 
in appearance. 

Take one cup of stale bread crumbs, 
?^i?^"''^ and soften with two tablespoons of 
water or milk, mixed with one slightly 
beaten egg. Stir until well blended. 

10 



Loaf 



Beef 

Cecils 



Minced 
Stew 



Add a chopped onion, 1 teaspoon 
of minced parsley or celery tops, 
salt and pepper. Mix with two pounds 
of Hamburg steak and bake at moder- 
ate heat one hour in a greased loaf pan. 
When done turn out of the pan and 
serve with a brown sauce. Strained 
tomato, tomato sauce or brown gravy 
may be used to moisten the loaf instead 
of milk. Two pounds of steak are 
enough for five persons. 

As a variation from the loaf, mix 
the Hamburg steak as directed and 
form into flat cakes. Brown them in 
a frying pan over a slow fire, turning 
often to secure even cooking. 

For two persons, buy a half pound 
of Hamburg steak. Put one cup of 
boiling water into a skillet. Add salt 
and pepper to the meat and then stir- 
ring, cook in the boiling water until 
most of the latter has evaporated. Place 
spoonfuls of the steak on thin slices 
of toast and pour the gravy left in the 
pan over it. 

11 



Brown 
Stew with 
Dump- 
lings 



Stuffed 
Heart 



Two pounds of beef from the neck, 
shin or shank will make this appetiz- 
ing stew. Cut the beef into one-inch 
cubes; put ^ cup of suet into a sauce- 
pan. When the fat is rendered, take 
out the cracklings, throw the meat into 
the hot fat and shake it over the fire 
until browned. Add two tablespoons 
flour and one quart stock or water. Stir 
until boiling, season with salt, pepper 
and a small onion; cover and cook 
slowly for Ij/^ hours. Ten minutes be- 
fore serving take 1 cup flour, add ^ 
teaspoon salt and 2 level teaspoons bak- 
ing powder; sift and add sufficient milk 
to moisten. Drop this dough by spoon- 
fuls on top of stew, cover, and cook for 
10 minutes without lifting the cover. 
Arrange the dumplings around the 
edge of the platter, place the stew in 
center and serve. 

Beef heart is inexpensive. House- 
keepers should use it more often. The 
best way to prepare is to stuff it 
and bake. Have the butcher remove 
the gristle and tough red part at the 
top. Wash the heart carefully, then 

12 



parboil for half an hour in water that 
just simmers. Make a stuffing of 1 
cup of stale bread crumbs, 2 table- 
spoons of lard, suet or salt pork 
chopped fine, ^ teaspoon salt, dash of 
pepper, 2 sprigs of parsley chopped 
fine, and Y^. cup of any cold vegetable 
on hand. Fill the three holes of the 
parboiled heart with this stuffing. Sew 
up the openings, dredge with flour and 
bake 1^ hours in a hot oven. Baste 
often. Serve with Chili sauce. 

Hungarian 2 lbs. top round of 1 onion 

Goulash beef 2 bay leaves 

2 ounces salt pork 6 whole cloves 

2 cups tomatoes 6 peppercorns 

1 stalk celery 1 blade mace 

Cut the beef into two-inch pieces 
and sprinkle with flour; fry the salt 
pork until light brown, add the beef 
and cook slowly for 35 minutes, stir- 
ring occasionally. Cover with water 
and simmer for two hours. Make a 
sauce of the vegetables and spices as 
follows: Cook all together in suffi- 
cient water to cover for 20 minutes; 
then rub through a sieve, and add to 

1.3

Stew 



some of the stock in which the meat is 
cooked. Thicken with flour, using 2 
tablespoons (moistened with cold wa- 
ter) to each cup of liquid, and bring 
to the boiling point. Serve the meat 
on a platter with the sauce poured 
over it. 

Pound flour into both sides of a 
round steak, using as much as the meat 
will take up. Sear in drippings, then 
add water enough to cover it. Cover 
the dish tightly, so that the steam can- 
not escape, and allow the meat to sim- 
mer for two hours, or until tender. 

1 pound round of beef 1 cup soft stale bread 
Yi. lb. lean fresh pork crumbs 





1 small onion 


1 egg 




1 green pepper 


2 cups stewed to 


Filipino 


1 teaspoon salt

Beef 


2 tablespoons butter 


2 slices bacon 

4 tablespoons flour 



Remove the seeds from the pepper 
and chop fine with the meats and onion. 
Add crumbs, beaten egg and salt. 
Shape into a roll, place in a shallow 
greased baking dish, pour the strained 
tomatoes around it, put the bacon on

Flank 
Stew

Stew 



top, and bake 45 minutes, basting with 
the tomatoes. Thicken the gravy with 
the flour cooked in the butter. A little 
seasoning, such as a bay leaf, a clove, 
and a small piece of onion, improves 
the tomato sauce. This dish will serve 
6 to 8 people. When the meat is 20 
cents a pound and every other item is 
valued at usual town market prices, 
the total cost is about 50 cents. 

When preparing to broil a porter- 
house steak, cut off the tough flank and 
serve for stew at another meal. 

2 lbs. of neck mutton 6 potatoes 

2 tablespoons of drip- Parsley 

pings Salt 
2 onions 

Cut the meat into pieces about two 
inches square, washing carefully to re- 
move bits of bone. Sear the outside of 
the meat in the hot drippings. Slice 
the onions and add to the meat with 
the parsley. Cover with cold water. 
Bring rapidly to the boiling point, then 
let it simmer until tender. (Fast boil- 
ing toughens the meat.) After the 
meat has cooked two hours add the 

15 



Smoked 

White 

Fish 



Finnan 
Haddie 



potatoes, pared and cut into cubes. 
Cook until potatoes are done. Do not 
use any more water than is necessary. 
The stew should be thick. 

Fish is highly nutritious, easily di- 
gested, and usually much less in price 
than other meats. At least once or 
twice a week it should appear upon the 
menu. The price of fresh fish is rarely 
high, while smoked and dried fish may 
be purchased from the smallest allow- 
ance. Of smoked whitefish or trout a 
delicious dish may be concocted. 

Pick the fish into small pieces with 
fork or fingers, removing all skin and 
bones. To a cupful of the fish add a 
cupful of cold boiled potatoes chopped. 
Make a sauce of 2 tablespoons butter, 2 
tablespoons flour, y^ teaspoon salt and 
1 cup of milk. Stir sauce into fish. 
Place in a small baking dish and brown 
in the oven. 

Finnan Haddie may be prepared 
like smoked whitefish. Soak ^ hour 
in hot water before removing skin, etc. 
Put buttered bread crumbs on top be- 
fore setting in oven to brown. 

16 



Codfish 
Balls 



Fish 
Souffle 



Buy the salt codfish in one piece. 
This is more economical and tastes bet- 
ter than that already shredded. Soak 
the fish over night, drain and pick into 
fine pieces. To a cup of the fish add 
1^ cups of raw potatoes sliced. Place 
fish and potatoes in a saucepan, cover 
with boiling water and cook until the 
potatoes are soft. Drain off the water 
and press fish and potatoes through a 
sieve. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 2 
tablespoons milk, and beat all together 
with a fork. Cool the mixture and 
mold into flat cakes. Fry in deep fat, 
and drain on brown paper. 

Use 1 cup of Finnan Haddie which 
has soaked in warm water for 2 hours 
or more, and has been then flaked; 1 
cup cold mashed potatoes, 1 tablespoon 
butter, j^ cup hot milk, the yolk of 1 
egg well beaten. Stir all together and 
beat 3 minutes. Beat the whites of 2 
eggs until stifif. Fold lightly into the 
fish mixture and pile quickly into a 
baking dish. Bake in a moderate oven 
until firm. 

17 



Veal and 
Lamb 



Poultry 



Veal and lamb are usually expen- 
sive; they are neither so nutritious nor 
digestible as beef and mutton, hence 
are not entitled to consideration here. 
Poultry should be bought sparingly by 
the economical housewife, for in no 
other meat is there so much waste. 
With fowl one pays for a larger per 
cent of bone and refuse than with any 
other meat. When the apparent price 
of chicken is 20 cents, its real price is 
about 50 cents per pound. The most 
economical chicken to buy is the stew- 
ing chicken. By cooking in a small 
amount of water, closely covered, much 
nutriment may be saved that is lost 
when roasting, broiling, etc.

CHAPTER III 

The food value of eggs is so great 
that even when the price is high, they 
are less expensive than good meat. The 
ways of cooking eggs are practically 
without end. The following are some 
of the most appetizing. 

Boil five eggs hard. Remove whites 
from yolks. Chop whites fine and stir 
into 1 cup of white sauce. Mash the 
yolks with a fork and add ^ teaspoon 
salt. Arrange slices of buttered toast 
upon a flat dish. On each slice pour 2 
spoonfuls of sauce containing the egg 
whites. Sprinkle the mashed yolks 
upon the top. 

Bake large white potatoes. When 
done, remove from oven. Cut a por- 
tion of the skin from the side of each 
potato and, without splitting the re- 
maining skin, take out a large spoonful 
of the potato. Into the cavity drop 1 
raw egg. Return to oven and cook 
until egg is "set."

Allow 1 egg for each person to be 
served. Drop the whites into a bowl 
and place each yolk in a separate 
saucer. Whip the whites until stiff, 
adding a pinch of salt. Pile the whites 
lightly into a buttered baking dish, 
making a slight depression in the mass 
with a spoon, one cavity for each egg 
yolk. Drop an egg yolk, unbroken, 
into each depression. Place dish in a 
moderate oven and brown. 

Eggs are considered more digestible 
if cooked in water which has just 
boiled, but does not boil during the 
cooking of them. Eggs cooked this 
way are called soft or hard coddled 
eggs. A longer time is required for 
cooking, naturally. 

Boil y^ cup of rice in 1 quart of boil- 
ing salted water until tender. Drain 
off the water at once. Pile rice on a 
platter, to resemble nests. In each 
nest place a soft poached egg. 

Allow 1 egg for each person to be 
served. Beat yolks and whites together 
until the mass can be picked up in 
spoonfuls. For each tgg used add 1

tablespoon thick tomato sauce. Turn 
into a hot skillet in which 1 or 2 tea- 
spoons of butter have been melted, and 
scramble. Serve on hot toast. 

Boil 1 cup spaghetti in salted water 
25 minutes. Drain and dispose on a 
platter. Sprinkle with salt and tiny 
pieces of butter. Poach 4 eggs. Lift 
carefully and arrange on the spaghetti. 

Beat 6 eggs, whites and yolks to- 
gether, until well blended. Add 3 ta- 
blespoons of milk, 1 onion chopped 
fine, 1 chopped tomato, or >4 cup of 
canned tomatoes, 1 teaspoon chopped 
parsley, }i teaspoon of salt. Pour into 
buttered timbale moulds and bake un- 
til firm, setting the moulds in a pan of 
boiling water while they cook. When 
brown, turn out of the moulds on a 
serving platter and serve with tomato 
sauce. 

Pecan meats make the best scramble. 
Allow ^ cup of nuts to 6 eggs. Beat 
the eggs, whites and yolks together, un- 
til well blended. For each 6 eggs add 
3 tablespoons of water, ji teaspoon salt.

Stir in nut meats, turn into a hot

Compared with other foods, cheese 
ranks high in nutriment value. It 
contains nearly twice as much protein, 
weight for weight, as beef of average 
composition, and its fuel value is twice 
as great. It is also rich in fat, excel- 
ling beef, eggs, milk, bread and pota- 
toes. It is an error to consider cheese 
difficult of digestion. In this respect it 
ranks favorably with other staple foods, 
and is quite as thoroughly assimilated 
as others. Cheese should be a favorite 
with the housekeeper who wishes to 
furnish nourishing meals at low cost. 

1 cup cheese cut into 1 cup milk 

small pieces 3 eggs 

1 cup soft stale bread Yi teaspoon salt

Scald the milk and add the bread 
crumbs. Beat the egg yolks ; add these 
and the cheese and salt. Lastly, fold in 
the egg whites beaten stifif. Bake 20 
minutes in a moderate oven. Serve at 
once.

quarts boiling salted water. Drain. 
Grease a baking dish. Place ^ the 
rice in the bottom. Cover with tomato, 
parsley and onion. Add the remaining 
rice and sprinkle the grated cheese on 
top. Place in the oven to brown the 
cheese. 

Macaroni or spaghetti, when pre- 
pared with milk, cheese or eggs, should 
not be accompanied in the menu with 
meat. These dishes contain sufficient 
proteid. The most popular dish of 
macaroni is au gratin.

into a buttered baking dish, then a 
layer of sauce and cheese, then maca- 
roni again, and so on in layers, until the 
dish is full, reserving enough of the 
cheese to cover the top. Brown in the 
oven. As a variation melt the cheese 
in the sauce; add macaroni, pour into 
dish and place crumbs upon the top. 

Prepare the dish as macaroni au 
gratin, using tomato sauce instead of 
the white sauce. ^ To make tomato 
sauce, let the tomatoes from 1 can stew 
slowly with 1 onion sliced, 3 sprigs of 
parsley and 1 bay leaf. When reduced 
one-half, strain and use. 

Lentils contain a high percentage of 
proteids, or muscle-building material. 
They are grown largely in Europe, 
where they form the main fare of the 
peasants. Usually they are to be found 
in our markets dried. One pound of 
lentils is sufficient for a meal for six 
persons. 

When made thick, this soup, supple- 
mented with bread and butter, is almost 
a meal in itself. Wash 1 cup of len- 
tils, soak several hours, then boil slowly

Press all through a strainer, add salt, 
1 tablespoon catsup, 1 tablespoon but- 
ter, or other fat, and hot milk to thin to 
desired consistency. 

Wash 1 cup of lentils and soak in 2 
quarts of cold water over night. In the 
morning put the lentils on to boil in 
cold water. Boil slowly until they can 
be pierced with a needle. The length 
of time will depend upon the age of the 
legumes. Drain the lentils, saving the 
water for soup, and place in a greased 
baking dish, with 2 large tablespoons 
of drippings, salt, pepper, 1 tablespoon 
of vinegar, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. 
Bake in the oven until tender. 

Wash, soak and boil the lentils as in 
the preceding recipe, allowing them to 
boil until quite tender. Strain and 
press through a sieve. To the pulp add 
^ cup of the liquor in which they were 
boiled, y2 teaspoon salt, a dash of pep- 
per, 2 tablespoons of drippings, 1 ta- 
blespoon parsley, chopped fine. Beat 
well and mould into croquettes, adding 

25 



milk if the mixture appears too dry. A 
well-beaten egg is an improvement. 
When firm, roll the croquettes in fine 
dry crumbs, dip in egg (1 slightly- 
beaten egg and 2 tablespoons cold 
water), then in crumbs again and fry. 
The covering serves to form a shell 
which prevents the croquettes from 
soaking fat. 

Soak 2 cups of split peas over night. 
In the morning place over the fire in 2 
Split Pea Q^^^ts of water, with a good-sized onion 
cut into slices. Allow to simmer until 
quite tender. Add 1 cup of milk, 1 ta- 
blespoon butter, pepper, and salt, and 
serve.

Tie up in a piece of cheesecloth a little 
thyme, summer savory and parsley, and 
let boil in the strained soup for 10 min- 
utes. Add a tablespoon of butter, salt 
and pepper.

tablespoon hot water), ^ teaspoon salt, 
y2 cup flour. Mix in order mentioned 
and bake on hot griddle. 

Pour the boiled cereal left from 
breakfast into a shallow pan to harden. 
Next morning slice it, dip each slice 
into crumbs and fry brown. Serve with 
syrup. 

Shape cold mashed potatoes into 
small flat cakes. Roll in flour and 
brown each side in a hot frying pan. 
Drippings from bacon make a good fat 
in which to brown these cakes. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into slices. 
Season with salt and pepper. Brown 
on both sides in a hot greased skillet. 

Slice leftover beets. Marinate in 
vinegar and serve next day cold. 

Leftover vegetables make delicious 
cream soups. Almost any vegetable 
may be used, carrots, peas, asparagus, 
spinach, potatoes and cauliflower being 
among the best. To make a cream 

29 



soup, melt 1 tablespoon butter in the 
upper pan of a double boiler. When 
the butter bubbles, stir in 1 tablespoon 
flour, Yz teaspoon salt, dash of pepper, 
and cook until smooth. Place over 
boiling water and add 1 cup of milk 
slowly. When blended, add the vege- 
table, which must have been mashed 
fine with a fork. Cook over the boil- 
ing water five minutes, strain, then 
serve. 

Odds and ends of vegetables may be 
utilized in clear soups, a tablespoon or 
less of each not to exceed three kinds. 
Let the vegetable heat in the soup. 

Bits of cold vegetables may be com- 
bined into a salad, using not more than 
three kinds. If the vegetables have 
been served with either butter or a 
sauce, wash quickly in cold water and 
let dry before using for salad. A boiled 
dressing is best for vegetable salad. 
Arrange the vegetables upon crisp let- 
tuce leaves before serving. 

Use any leftover vegetable. Cut it

Pastry scraps may be utilized to 
make dainties for luncheon. Roll the 
dough left from pies into a thin sheet 
and spread with chopped dates, raisins, 
figs, nuts, a mixture of whatever hap- 
pens to be on hand; lay another sheet 
of paste on top and press lightly with 
the roller. Cut into shapes and bake 
a delicate brown. 

Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar in be- 
tween pieces of paste, or on top, using

Another use for pastry scraps is to 
sprinkle the rolled-out dough with 
grated cheese, seasoned with salt and 
cayenne pepper. Cut into long strips 
and bake.

add enough of the hot potatoes to hold 
the fish balls together. Shape the mix-

as much potato as fish. The addition 
of one egg is an improvement, as it 
holds the mixture together better.

Food Value of Milk 

CHAPTER V 

Milk and milk products are whole- 
some and economical foods, which may 
readily be used in quantity in the diet. 

Quality and cleanliness in handling 
are important topics which must be 
considered, as well as food value. 

Cow's milk is a perfect food. It 
contains, first, materials which are 
needed for growth; second, materials 
which repair the bodily machinery; 
and, third, materials which provide 
the heat and energy necessary for work. 
This does not mean, however, that milk 
can be used as an exclusive food, either 
for grown-ups or children. Variety is 
also required. 

Compared with other animal foods, 
milk is cheap as well as nutritious. A 
quart of milk supplies practically as 
much of both protein and energy as 
three-quarters of a pound of beef of 
average composition, or eight average 
eggs, and can generally be bought for 
less money. In case milk is 6 cents a 

36 



quart, beef 20 cents a pound, and eggs 
24 cents a dozen, 10 cents spent for milk 
will buy a little more protein and much 
more energy than 10 cents spent for 
beef or 10 cents spent for eggs. Thus, 
milk may be used as an economical sub- 
stitute for either of them. 

Some vegetable foods, like flour, are 
much cheaper than milk when both 
price and nutritive value are consid- 
ered, and as a matter of fact form the 
bulk of human food; but of the animal 
foods, milk is one of the cheapest. 
Milk should be used instead of more 
expensive foods — not in addition to 
them. A glass of milk reduces the 
amount of meat or other proteid mate- 
rial required. From the point of view 
of bodily need, serving both at one 
meal is extravagant. Any appetizing 
milk dish can take the place of eggs, 
meat, etc. 

As a wholesome and nutritious food, 
Butter- buttermilk is also valuable. It has 3 
^^^^ per cent of proteids, and a quart con- 

tains one-fourth as much proteid as a 
man needs in a day, even if the most 



37 



liberal estimate of his needs is taken. 
It is said to possess hygienic value as 
well, the theory being that lactic-acid 
bacteria may grow in the intestines, 
crowding out other and undesirable 
kinds. 

Though not much different in nutri- 
tive value, buttermilk obtained as a by- 
product in butter-making has a differ- 
ent quality or texture and a different 
flavor from so-called skim-milk butter- 
milk referred to above. 

Pure milk is easily spoiled by im- 
Handling proper treatment in the home; for in- 
,^ . stance, by putting it in unclean recep- 

Milk tacles, by too much exposure to the air, 

by failure to keep it cool, by exposing 

to flies. 

Milk readily absorbs impurities and 
bacteria from the air or from unclean 
surfaces, and warm milk is a good 
breeding ground for all kinds of germs. 
They multiply rapidly in milk which 
remains very long at 50° F. or higher. 

Impure or germ-laden milk is dan- 
gerous. It may contain the bacteria of 

38 



contagious diseases or the more com- 
mon bacteria which cause indigestion 

Care of ^^^ cholera infantum in babies. 

Milk 

in the Careful handling at home is quite as 

Home important as the securing of pure milk 
from the source of supply. 

The best way of buying milk is in 
Receiving bottles. Dipping milk from large cans 
the and pouring it into customers' recep- 

3Iilk ^^^igg Qj^ |.j^g street, with all the incident 

exposure to dusty air not always the 
cleanest, is a bad practice. Draw- 
ing milk from the faucet of a re- 
tailer's can is almost as bad as dip- 
ping, because, although the milk may 
be exposed to the street air a little less 
than by the dipping process, it is not 
kept thoroughly mixed, and some con- 
sumers will receive less than their pro- 
portion of cream. If situated so that it 
is impossible to get bottled milk, do not 
set out overnight an uncovered vessel 
to collect thousands of bacteria from 
street dust before milk is put into it. 
Have the milk delivered personally to 
some member of the family if possible; 

39 



Milk 

Vessel 

Covered

be Left 
in Sun 



if not, set out a bowl covered with a 
plate, or better still, use a glass preserv- 
ing jar in which nothing but milk is 
put. In the latter case, use a jar with 
a glass top, but omit the rubber band. 
Paper tickets are often more or less 
soiled; hence, if they are used do not 
put them in the can, bowl or jar. For 
the same reason, money should not be 
put in the can. 

Take the milk into the house as soon 
as possible after delivery, particularly 
in hot weather. Never allow the sun 
to shine for any length of time on the 
milk. Sometimes milk delivered as 
early as 4 a. m. remains out of doors 
until 9 or 10 o'clock. This is wrong. 
If it is inconvenient to receive the milk 
soon after it is delivered, indicate to 
the driver a sheltered place, or provide 
a covered box in which the milk bottle 
or can may be left. 

On receiving the milk, put it in the 
Keep Cold refrigerator at once and allow it to 
remain there when not using it. Ex- 
cept in cold weather milk can not be 

40 



properly kept without ice. Unless the 
milk bottle is in actual contact with the 
ice it will be colder at the bottom of the 
refrigerator than in the ice compart- 
ment, as the cold air settles rapidly. 

Keep milk in the original bottle till 
needed for immediate consumption; 
do not pour it into a bowl or pitcher 
for storage. Carefully wipe or rinse 
the bottle, especially the mouth, before 
pouring any milk from it, so that dust 
or dirt which may have gathered there- 
Keep ill oj^ or Q^ the cap will not get into the

milk which has been exposed to the air 
by being placed in other vessels. Keep 
the bottle covered with a paper cap as 
long as milk is in it and when not actu- 
ally pouring from it. If the paper cap 
has been punctured, cover the bottle 
with an inverted tumbler. 

Milk deteriorates by exposure to the 
air of pantry, kitchen or nursery. Do 
not expose uncovered milk in a refrig- 
erator containing food of any kind, not 
to mention strong-smelling foods like 

41 



Bottle 



fish, cabbage or onions. An excellent 
way of serving milk on the table, from 
the sanitary standpoint, is in the origi- 
nal bottle; at all events pour out only 
what will be consumed at one meal. 

When milk is received in a bowl or 
pitcher instead of in a bottle, observe 
the spirit of the foregoing remarks: 
Keep the milk vessel covered; expose 
uncovered milk to the air of any room 
as little as possible; do not expose it at 
all in a refrigerator. 

Remember that exposure of milk to

engers may convey germs of typhoid

The from such a cause, and 100,000 fecal

examination of 414 flies showed an 
average of 1,250,000 bacteria per fly. 

Keep the refrigerator clean and 
sweet. Personally inspect it at least 
once a week. See that the outlet for 
water formed by the melting ice is kept 
open, and that the space under the ice 
rack is clean. The place where food 
is kept should be scalded every week; 
a single drop of spilled milk or a small 
particle of other neglected food will 
contaminate a refrigerator in a few 
days. 

As soon as a milk bottle is empty, 
rinse it in lukewarm water until it ap- 
pears clear, then set it bottom up to 
drain. Do not use it for any other pur- 
pose than for milk. There is no objec- 
tion to the consumer's washing and 
scalding the milk bottle, but this is un- 
necessary, as the dealer will wash it 
again when it reaches his plant. He 
can not, however, do this properly if he 
receives the bottle in a filthy condition, 
and if you return such a bottle your 
negligence may result in the subsequent 

43 



Bottles 



delivery of contaminated milk to some 
consumer, possibly yourself. 

All utensils with which milk comes 
Scald Milk i^ contact should be rinsed, washed 
and scalded every time they are used. 
Use fresh water; do not wash them in 
dishwater which has been used for 
washing other utensils, or wipe them 
with an ordinary dish towel; it is bet- 
ter to boil in clean water and set them 
away unwiped. 



Sour 
Milk 



Curd 
Pie 



Sour milk is used to a large extent 
in cookery, and the sour milk itself, or 
more commonly the sour-milk curd, is 
considered by many persons a palatable 
and wholesome dish. Sour cream is 
also used in many ways in the house- 
hold in the making of sauces and dress- 
ings and in cookery. 

Sweet curds may be made into a good 
filling for pies or tarts. The curd is 
obtained by adding rennet to warm 
milk and allowing the milk to stand un- 
til it hardens. The curd is then broken 
up and strained. To the curd from 1 
quart of milk add 1 level tablespoon 

44 



Whey 



Cottage 
Cheese 



of butter, % of a cup of sugar, the yolks 
of 2 eggs, and a few Zante currants or 
chopped raisins, and a little nutmeg. 
In earlier times the sweet curd from 
cheese-making was much used as a 
food, but is not common today, though 
sometimes served where it can be read- 
ily obtained from a cheese factory. 
Whey was also much used in earlier 
times and is still a favorite beverage 
with many, and employed especially in 
invalid dietetics. 

Perhaps the most common name in 
the United States for the freshly sepa- 
rated skim-milk curd is cottage cheese, 
though other names, for instance, 
schmierkase, are also well known. 

Cottage cheese contains all the pro- 
teids of milk and part of the fat. It is 
made either by heating the curd 
slightly and straining, or by straining it 
without heating. If any heat is used, 
it should be very gentle, or the curd 
will become hard and unpalatable. A 
safe way of heating is to pour boiling 
water into the curd. This is a good 
way also for those who do not care for 

45 



French 
Cheese 



the taste of lactic acid, for the hot water 
serves to remove part of this. 

Cottage cheese would probably be a 
more popular dish if it were served in 
a greater variety of ways. For many 
palates it needs to be enriched with a 
little butter or cream. The French va- 
riety is commonly served with sugar 
and cream, and a similar dish is eaten 
in the United States, often being sea- 
soned with a little ground cinnamon or 
nutmeg. 

Cottage cheese is always a good addi- 
tion to or accompaniment of salads. A 
good luncheon which can be served in 
one course consists of cottage cheese in 
which the first portions are eaten with 
dressed lettuce or water cress, and the 
last portion with a little of some rather 
sweet fruit preserve, such as strawberry 
or raspberry jam or preserved quinces. 
Served with bread and butter and tea, 
this makes a well-balanced meal. 

Cheese Cottage cheese flavored in different 

Sandwich ways may be used for sandwiches. In 
busy households it may be well to pre- 
pare the filling and to allow the various 

46 



Lunch 
Cheese 



members of the family to make their 
own sandwiches at the table. Caraway 
seeds, chopped stuffed olives of differ- 
ent sorts, and chives (a vegetable which 
may be easily grown in the kitchen 
window, as well as the kitchen garden) 
make good flavors. Instead of the dif- 
ferent kinds of stuffed olives, plain 
olives and pimentos may be chopped 
separately and added, but this requires 
more work. 

The question is likely to arise why 
Sour Milk sour milk and its products are consid- 
Safe ered safe food to be eaten raw, while 

stale sweet milk is looked upon with 
some suspicion unless it has been 
cooked. The reason is that for a long 
time after the milk is drawn all the bac- 
teria which enter into it increase in 
number, the increase being more or less 
rapid, depending chiefly on the temper- 
ature at which the milk is kept. Some 
of these bacteria may be kinds that 
produce disease. Finally, however, 
when milk sours, the harmless lactic- 
acid bacteria and the lactic acid which 
they produce tend to destroy other or- 
ganisms. 

47 



Milk 
Gravies 



Milk 
Toast 



3Iilk 
Chowder 



A great variety of milk gravies, 
thickened with flour and enriched with 
butter or other fat, may be served with 
potatoes or other vegetables or poured 
over toast. The proportions are 2 level 
tablespoons of flour and 2 level ta- 
blespoons of butter to 1 cup of milk. 
To this may be added chipped beef, 
codfish or other fresh or salt fish, hard- 
boiled eggs, small portions of chicken 
or veal, or grated cheese. Milk gravy 
flavored with cheese makes a good and 
very nutritious sauce to pour over caul- 
iflower and cabbage or to serve with 
boiled rice or hominy. 

A good way to serve milk toast 
is to toast bread very thoroughly and to 
pour hot milk over it at the time of 
serving. In serving milk toast in this 
way all the dishes should be kept very 
hot. A heavy earthenware pitcher may 
be used for serving the hot milk, as it 
retains heat for a long time. 

Chowders are also a very acceptable 
means of serving milk. In making 
rich chowders the proportions used 
are: Two cups of milk or of milk and 

48 



water, 1 cup of potatoes cut into small 
pieces and 1 pound of fish. The flavor- 
ing is onions and fat fried from salt 
pork. While these proportions make 
a rich dish, it is possible to reduce the 
amount of fish greatly, to leave it out 
entirely, to use small portions of left- 
over fish or some salt codfish which has 
been freshened, or to substitute corn 
for it. Such dishes are palatable and 
of reasonably high nutritive value, pro- 
viding the greater part of the liquid 
used is milk. 

Junket served very cold is a refresh- 
ing dessert in hot weather, as are the 
Milk numerous milk sherbets, frozen cus- 

Desserts tards, and similar desserts in which milk 
is used. Baked milk, made by cooking 
sweetened and flavored milk for a long 
time in a slow oven, is also good. 
Many different kinds of puddings are 
made by baking milk with cereals and 
either molasses or sugar. The cereal 
may be rice, cornmeal, or buttered 
white or whole-wheat bread. In this 
class of food belongs, so far as nour- 
ishment is concerned, the scalloped po- 
tatoes made by cooking sliced raw po- 
tatoes for a long time in a large amount 
of milk.

Food Value of Vegetables and How to 

Prepare Them 



Simple 
Prepara- 
tion 



Should be 
Crisp 



CHAPTER VI 

The most common method of pre- 
paring vegetables for the table is boil- 
ing, though they are often baked, 
roasted, steamed or fried. Usually the 
simplest methods are best to bring out 
flavor and to aid digestion. 

All green vegetables, roots and 
tubers should be crisp and firm when 
put on to cook. If for any reason a 
vegetable has lost its firmness it should 
be soaked in very cold water until it 
becomes plump and crisp. With new 
vegetables this may take only a few 
minutes, but it may require hours to 
freshen old roots and tubers. All vege- 
tables should be thoroughly cleaned 
just before cooking. Vegetables that 
form heads, such as cabbage, cauli- 
flower, Brussels sprouts, should be 
soaked head down in salted cold water 
a half hour longer. If there are any 
worms or insects in them these will 
crawl out. 

50 



For best results, all vegetables ex- 
Boiling cept dry legumes, should be put on the 
fire in boiling salted water and the wa- 
ter kept boiling throughout the cook- 
ing. Herbaceous vegetables should 
boil rapidly all the time. Tubers, 
roots, cauliflower, etc., should not boil 
violently enough to break them. Green 
vegetables should merely simmer. To 
secure the most palatable dishes, only 
tender vegetables should be cooked. If, 
however, they are unavoidably tough, 
a small quantity of baking soda may be 
added to the cooking water to help 
soften the cellulose. No vegetable 
should be cooked closely covered. 
Allow the steam to escape, and cook 
until perfectly tender, but not long 
enough to lose shape. Avoid using a 
large quantity of water, as more of the 
savor and nutritious substances will be 
lost. 

In preparing vegetables for the table 

Loss From ^^^^ ^°^^ °^ edible matter nearly 

Parings always accompanies paring, seeding, 

etc. ; but with care this may be lessened 

appreciably and is well worth consid- 

61 



eration. Whenever possible, cook with- 
out paring, and thus save a goodly por- 
tion. Potatoes boiled or baked in jack- 
ets lose very little in cooking. Always 
peel beets, salsify, carrots, etc., after 
cooking. The tough skins keep the in- 
ner juices from escaping. Peas may be 
boiled in the pod, too. When possible, 
leave vegetables in large pieces; there 
is much less loss than when small pieces 
are used. 

For economy's sake, never buy vege- 

Buy Vege- tables out of season. Their cost then 

tables in is out of all proportion to the nutriment 

Season gained. Buy each in its natural season. 

They also have much better flavor then, 

and are much more likely to be fresh. 

Potatoes and other winter roots may be 

bought to advantage when the main 

crop is marketed and stored for later 

use. But one must be careful to store 

properly in a dry, cool place, else the 

ultimate loss of spoiled food will show 

an expense. 

Some fresh vegetables can never be 
bought in cities as cheaply or of such 

52 



good flavor as the best canned goods; 
Canned peas and corn, for instance. But in 
Goods buying canned food, never buy the 

cheapest, for the cheapest in price is 
likely to prove the most expensive. The 
can of water-packed tomatoes, green 
hard peas, the handful of berries in a 
pint of water, or poor quality beans 
disguised with tomato dressing, offered 
at a low price, are low in food value. 
Goods which are strictly standard give 
the best food value for the cost; but do 
not pay for fancy sizes. A medium 
sized pea is as nutritious as extra sifted 
and does not cost so much. Get the 
average size in beans, corn, tomatoes, 
asparagus too. Many cents may be 
saved by purchasing canned vegetables 
by the dozen or case, rather than by 
single cans. 

It is seldom an economy for house- 
Canning wives in cities to can at home. This 
at Home may be done only when there is a sur- 
plus in one's own garden.

Miscellaneous Economies in Cooking 

CHAPTER IX 

Save the water in which spinach 

Spinach or asparagus has been cooked. This 

Water water contains many valuable mineral 

salts. Use it instead of fresh water 

when making soup or boiling meat. 

Potatoes baked or boiled in their 
Potatoes jackets are more nutritious than those 
in Jackets cooked after peeling. The skin pre- 
vents considerable nutriment from go- 
ing to waste. 

The water from boiled rice con- 
•^^*^® tains nutriment. Use it in cooking the 

^ breakfast cereal. 

Much food, such as green vegetables 
Take Care and fruits, is wasted after purchasing, 
of Perish- ^y spoiling before it is used. If prop- 
able Food gj.jy cared for, much of this might be 
saved. 

Spread out in a thin layer berries 
Keeping of every sort, and keep them in a cool. 
Berries dry and dark place. If they seem soft 

and unlikely to keep, stew them in a 

little sugar syrup.

Lettuce 



Celery 



Asparagu* 



Wash lettuce carefully, so as not to 
bruise. Put it, dripping, into a closely 
covered earthenware pot. Set in a cool 
place. Lettuce thus prepared will keep 
fresh and crisp for several days. 

Celery, cress and endive should be 
treated the same way. 

Set asparagus bunches in a few 
inches of cold water to keep them 
fresh; the water should not come more 
than half way up the stalks. 

To keep egg yolks from drying, put 

Egg Yolks in a jelly glass and just cover with olive 

oil. Put on ice and pour ofif the oil 

when ready to use. Cover egg whites 

with a little water. 

Dry scraps of bread in the oven. 
Bread When enough has accumulated, roll to 

Scraps powder with the rolling pin and put 

away in jars or tin boxes for croquettes, 

breading, etc. 

Bits of Neufchatel or cream cheese 

Cheese ^^Y be served again by mixing them 

Bits with butter or cream and spreading on 

thin crackers. Or, make them into 

sandwiches and serve with salad.

Cottage 
Cheese 



Potatoes should be thinly pared, as 
the best part lies next the skin. 

If cheese becomes too hard for 
use on the table, grate it and put away 
in bottles. It may be used for maca- 
roni, sandwiches, sauces and in many 
ways as a relish. 

When eggs are high, wash each egg 
carefully before opening. Save the 
shells to clear coffee. 

Save all fat fried out from cooking 
bacon and use it instead of butter for 
sauteing. This may also be used in- 
stead of fresh shortening in pancakes, 
waffles, and corn bread; also as the fat 
in vegetable purees. 

If milk sours it may be used in cook- 
ing in place of sweet milk and baking 
powder, by using soda instead of the 
latter. Proportion, 1 teaspoon to a pint 
of sour milk. Many people prefer this 
sour milk in biscuits, pancakes, gems, 
etc. 

Sour milk makes nutritious cheese 
called cottage cheese. Use milk which 
has loppered. When quite thick, hang

in a cheesecloth bag to drain off the 
whey. Let drip over night, then salt 
and mix with cream to desired consist- 
ency, breaking up the curd with a fork. 

Bread may be made with all water 
instead of milk if two additional tea- 
spoons of shortening are used. Knead 
the bread half again as long as milk 
bread.

How to Save Gas, Ice and Fuel 

CHAPTER X 

Fuel is always one of the big items of house- 
hold expenditure, and a few hints on its economical 
use will be helpful. 

The oven consumes the most gas, hence its use 
should be watched. Whenever it is necessary to 
heat the oven for bread or cake, plan to use it for 
cooking as many other articles as it will contain. 
Meat on that day may be roasted, potatoes and 
apples baked; the whole dinner may be cooked 
in a casserole. Never heat the oven for the few 
minutes needed to brown meringue or crumbs on a 
pudding. Have these dishes only on days ^yhen 
the oven must be in use anyway, for other things. 
Do not turn the burners on top of the stove high 
enough for rapid boiling unless the motion is 
needed, as in cooking rice or macaroni. When it 
is heat only that is wanted, adjust the flame so that 
the water just boils. Anything more than that is a 
pure waste of gas. The food will cook no quicker 
or better. To boil is to boil. No amount of heat 
can raise the temperature of water, or food in 
water, higher than 212" F. Never leave gas burn- 
ing while you go for materials, etc. Even when 
left for a moment the gas will be found much more 
expensive than matches. There are sauce pans 
made so that two or three vegetables may cook over 
one flame. Place a pan, inverted, over heating 
flat-irons. Less gas will be needed.

It is possible to do without ice during many 
months of the year. A box placed on its side with- 
out the kitchen window sill, facing in, makes an 
admirable and convenient cooling receptacle. 

During the hottest weather it is extremely diffi- 
cult to keep meat, butter and milk without ice. 
Indeed, milk requires it if kept for any length of 
time. To keep butter firm without ice, place it 
on an inverted bowl which lies in a pan of water. 
Do not let the water touch the butter. Over the 
butter put a large cloth, the ends extending into 
the water on all sides. Meat may be kept accept- 
ably a short time in the same way. Cooked meat 
keeps better than raw. Always sear a cut of meat 
in hot weather. 

Where there is no ice-box, a temporary substi- 
tute may be made on the fireless cooker plan. Line 
a box, cover sides and bottom with many thick- 
nesses of newspaper. Ice inside this box will keep 
a long time if tightly closed. Pack the food to be 
preserved next the ice. 

Ice in a refrigerator will last longer if the 
ice is wrapped in newspaper or canton flannel 
cloths before it is put in the ice chamber. It lasts 
longer this way, but does not keep the food quite 
as cold, as it is melting ice which draws the heat 
from the articles near it. 

Always be careful to close and latch the refrig- 
erator doors. If doors are left open, the warm air 
enters and helps melt the ice.
