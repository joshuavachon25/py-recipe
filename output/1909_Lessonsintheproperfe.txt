INTRODUCTION 

This book is for housekeepers with varying incomes from the 
very poorest to those having as much as $25 a week. It is in- 
tended to be used under the instruction of the visiting teacher of 
foods and cooking, who adapts the instruction to the needs of each 
home. In all cases the aim is to help the housekeeper to use her 
income to best advantage. 

The bills of fare have not been planned for persons who have 
been improperly fed for a long time. In the case of such persons 
it is important not to cut down on such foods as butter and milk, 
as their proper use helps to build up our bodies and keep them in 
condition to throw off disease. 

When using this book, remember : 

First: That only the most important points in each subject 
are spoken of. For example, when you know how to cook one 
kind of cereal properly, you can use this knowledge to help you in 
cooking any other kinds. When you learn how to economize heat 
in cooking one kind of meat, you will know how to apply this 
knowledge to a variety of meats. 

Second: When you use the first set of bills of fare, remember 
they show you only the very smallest amount you can give the 
family, to keep them well. For a variety which is best, you 
will have to spend about seven cents more every day for each 
person. It is not expected that any one will follow the bills of 
fare exactly as they are printed; they, are planned merely as 
examples of the kinds of food that are most valuable. 

Third: The recipes do not try to give the exact amount need- 
ed for any particular number of persons, but only the correct 
proportion of materials. The quantity needed will vary and must 
be decided by each housekeeper for herself. 

Fourth : All measurements in this book are level unless it is 
otherwise noted. Do not use heaped or rounded measures, as this 
will give bad results. The housekeeper must, however, make 
some allowance for different grades of flour, as the amount of 
moisture taken up will sometimes vary, and the recipe must be 
accordingly changed. 



THIS BOOK. WILL TELL YOU 

1. What food to eat. 

2. How to get the most food for the least money. 

3. How to cook your food. 

4. How to manage your kitchen. 

If you wish to spend one dollar for a practical cook book, order 
the Home Science Cook Book, by Mary J. Lincoln and Anna 
Barrows, at any book store. Some of the recipes in this book are 
taken from the Home Science Cook Book. 

If you wish to know more about these things, send a postal 
card to Washington, and the U. S. Government will send you free 
practical information about common foods, meat, milk, fish, eggs, 
cereals and bread.* 

HOW TO BUY 

Remember that you save money if you buy in quantities. 
When you get your money at the end of the week, buy as much of 
the week's supply of food as you can. Sugar, flour, tea, eggs, 
dried fruits, cocoa, butter, rice, oatmeal, and many other things 
can be bought more cheaply in this way. If you buy three cents' 
worth of tea or five cents' worth of butter you have to pay much 
more than if you bought by the pound. 

Buy by Weight 

When you buy a definite weight — a quarter pound, a half 
pound, a pound or more — you can test it and know whether you 
are getting your money's worth. Protect yourself in this way, 
and your money will go much further.

Delicatessen Stores. 

Do not make a practice of buying food at delicatessen stores 
for you have to pay the keeper of the store for preparing the 
food and you can do this much cheaper yourself. 

Cheap Food 

Cheap food is the food that gives most strength for the least 
money. 

For example : Potatoes are often thought to be a cheap food, 
but ten cents' worth of potatoes will not give nearly so much 
strength as ten cents' worth of cereals or bread. 

Your body is like a fire, always burning out; the main reason 
for eating is to keep your engine going. Food keeps the fire alive. 

Food that does not keep you well and make you strong is not 
good food. 

Fruits and Vegetables 

These are expensive during a large part of the year, but if 
you watch the market you will often find a healthful fruit or 
green vegetable to add to your meal for a few cents. 

Bread 

If you do not make your own bread, always buy the stale 
loaves", because in most stores fresh loaves cost twice as much 
as stale loaves, and the stale loaves are more wholesome. 

Milk 

Always buy milk from a clean place and keep it in clean 
dishes covered, so as to keep out dust. If necessary, loose milk 
may be used for cooking, but for use uncooked it is safer to buy 
bottled milk. The very lives of the children may depend on the 
purity of the milk, so it is worth while to save money from 
other foods to procure this necessity for the children. 



HOW TO BUY MEAT 

Remember that some of the cheap cuts of meat will give a 
large amount of strength, and that they may be made tender 
by long, slow cooking. 

Do not send to the market for ''fifteen cents' worth of steak,"" 
but learn the cuts and prices, and select meat so that you will 
get the most good for your money. 

Always ask for a piece of suet, even if it is not to be used at 
the time. Try it out, strain it and put it away in a clean cup 
for gravy or shortening. 

Beef suet cost ten cents a pound, and is one of the best fats 
to use. 

Here is a list of the cuts of beef and mutton in common use, 
with the average New York prices :

WHAT FOOD SHOULD DO 

1. Keep your muscles strong. 

2. Keep you warm. 

3. Keep your blood in good order. 

4. Make you feel strong and like working. 

Some foods make you strong, some warm, some keep your 
blood clean ; what you need is a good combination of all these 
kinds. 

Lean meat, milk, eggs, and cereals make muscle. 
Butter, fat meat, sugar and cereals keep you warm. 
Cereals, sugar, milk, butter and any fats make you fat. 
Sugar and cereals make you want to work. 
Vegetables, fruit and water keep your blood cle^n. 

The most nutritious of these are the muscle makers. 

You will see that most foods do several things for our bodies. 

The average family needs equal quantities of muscle making 
food and of fat making food, and three and one-half times that 
amount of the food that makes us feel like working. 

Here are some bills of fare that give you what you need. 

They are planned for a family — four children, two adults; 
average cost one day, 95 cents. 

EXPLANATION OF FIRST SET OF BILLS OF FARE. 

When you plan your meals for a day it is wise first to decide 
how to divide the money. Take care of the children first, and 
set aside money to give them milk, even if you cannot have the 
greatest variety of other foods. Milk is a food in itself, and the 
best one for children. Then decide how much to spend for 
meat. In this book the meat for one day never costs more than 
thirty cents for six persons, and often less. 

These bills of fare are meant to show the kinds of food 
that are good for us, and are planned for busy women who can 
not give time to fancy cooking. 

Notice that although more money is spent in the second set 
than in the first set, the simple, inexpensive meats are still used. 

8 



No allowance is made for buying in quantities, the prices of 
butter and eggs are those of winter, and a careful housekeeper 
can probably cut at least one dollar from the week's expense 
if she knows how to plan. When making your plans do not cut 
down on milk or the muscle-makers, but try to save on pota- 
toes or change from one of the puddings to fresh or stewed fruit. 

Notice that there is no butter in plan for fourth and sixth 
days. This is made up by bacon, pork and cornmeal. All of 
these do the same thing for us that butter does — that is, make 
us warm. 

The main dish of each breakfast is a cereal (makes you want 
to work) with sugar, with bread or toast, and coffee for the old- 
er members of the family, and hot cocoa shells for the children. 

Each dinner has one substantial dish, either meat or some other 
muscle maker, and a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes or rice. 
Two or three times in the week there is a simple pudding and a 
fresh vegetable. 

The supper is simple, with one main dish and tea, and milk for 
the children. 

If you can spend more money, use it for fresh vegetables and 
simple puddings, rather than for more expensive meats. 

When you make changes in the bills of fare, do not leave out 
the muscle making food. 

When eggs are cheap, cut out i quart of milk and give each 
person an egg. 

The first set of bills of fare covers two separate weeks, the 
first in winter and the second in summer. 

The second column in the Bills of Fare gives the materials 
needed for the whole day, without trying to say just how much 
milk, tea, bread, butter, etc., should be used at each meal.

SECOND SET OF BILLS OF FARE 

This set of bills of fare, requiring an average daily cost of 
23 cents per person or $1.38 for six, is planned for families who 
can afford an ample variety. Its purpose is to show that it is 
best to buy simple food, but to select such as will give us the 
most strength, even when it is not necessary to economize closely 
on the table.

cooked cereal, milk and sugar, a soft cooked tgg, bread and butter, 
milk or cocoa or cocoa shells. 

The dinner should be : Some meat cooked without grease, a 
baked potato, a fresh vegetable, a simple pudding, bread and 
butter.

HOW TO COOK MEAT 

The object of cooking meat is to make it tender and to keep 
in the juice and preserve the flavor. To keep in the juice and 
preserve the flavor, sear the meat on both sides, that is, press it 
down quickly on a hot pan, and then turn and sear the other side. 
When the meat turns a whitey brown color, a coating has been 
formed which will keep in the juice. After searing the meat, 
cook it slowly on a low fire. This will make it tender. Beef and 
mutton are the meats that are best for all persons. 

Meats, such as heart, liver, pork and kidney, should never be 
given to young children or persons who are not well. 

Pork should be used only in cold weather, and not frequently, 
even then. 

Fried Food 

If food is browned in the frying pan, be careful to have the 
pan just oiled with no loose grease, and to see that it is sizzling 
hot before the food goes in, otherwise it will be soaked with 
grease, and be very harmful. Do not fry steak. See direction 
for braising, p. 24, and for "pan broiling," p. 25. 

22 



To make soup, you need to draw out the juice. To do this, 
place the meat in cold water, bring to boiling and cook gently 
until tender. 

Wipe meat with wet cloth; do not wash in cold water, as 
this will draw out and waste the juice. 

Do not add salt to raw meat as it draws out the juice. 

For stew, plunge meat in cold water, bring quickly to boiling 
point and let simmer, not boil, until tender. 

For pot roast, put meat into boiling water, then let simmer. 

Minced Liver 

• Boil liver one half hour, remove stringy portions and chop 
fine. Moisten with water, add butter, salt and pepper. Serve 
hot with toast or potatoes. * 

Beefs Liver 

Cut in one half inch slices, place in boiling water for ten 
minutes, drain, remove skin, dip in melted pork or bacon fat, 
and broil or fry. 

Meat Pie 

Use stew, or remnants of cold meat covered with brown gravy, 
add a sliced onion, and if liked, two sliced potatoes. Place meat 
with gravy in baking dish, cover top with a baking powder biscuit 
crust, and bake in a hot oven. 

Corned Beef Hash 

Use equal parts of chopped meat and boiled potatoes, season, 
put in hot greased frying pan, moisten with milk, spread evenly 
and brown. 
Meat Soup or Soup Stock^ 

Best kind of beef, shin. 

Proportion — lean meat 2/3 — bone and fat 1/3. 

Wipe meat with damp cloth, cut lean meat in one inch pieces 
to draw out juice. Heat frying pan and brown 1/3 of the lean 
meat. Place fat, bone and remaining lean meat in kettle, cover 
with cold water, one pint to each pound of meat bone and fat, 
let stand one hour. Add browned meat and cook five or six

hours at a low heat. Add vegetables, salt and flavoring during 
last hour of cooking. Cool and skim. Bits of cold meat, left 
over vegetables or cereals may be added to the soup. 

Irish Stew"^ 

Three pounds of lamb (or i^ lbs. of lamb and i^^ lbs. 
of beef) cover with boiling water and cook slowly two hours 
or until tender. After cooking one hour, add one half cup each 
of carrot and turnip cut in cubes, and one onion cut in slices. Fif- 
teen minutes before serving add four cups parboiled (to par 
boil, cook for lo minutes) sliced potatoes, thickened with one- 
quarter cup flour rubbed smooth in cold water. Add flour very 
slowly, stirring all the time. Season and serve with dump- 
lings. 
Dumplings'^ 

2 cups flour ^ teaspoon ful salt 

4 tsp. baking powder 2 " butter 

^ cup milk. 

Sift dry materials, work in butter with finger tips, add milk 
slowly, toss on floured board, cut out, place on perforated pie 
plate, put plate over a kettle of boiling water, cover closely and 
steam twelve minutes. 
Pot Roast* 

Wipe meat, place in kettle, cover with boiling water, add i tsp. 
salt, a dash of pepper and a bit of bay leaf. Cook slowly until 
meat is very tender. Watch meat carefully and keep just enough 
water on it to prevent burning. 
Beef Cutlets Braised"^"^ 

Cut any inexpensive meat in pieces for serving, cover with 
brown gravy, bake in covered dish until meat is tender. Flank 
or chuck will do for this. 

Beef Roll • 

Hamburg steak, seasoned and make into firm roll, sear in hot 
fat, cover with brown gravy, place in covered pan, and bake for

i^ tablespoons molasses 

}i teaspoon mustard 

3 scant teaspoons butter 

3 scant teaspoons vinegar 

^/i teaspoon salt. 

Pepper. 

Soak the beans over night and boil till very soft, strain, mash 
and mix with molasses and spices, form in cakes and brown in 
a hot greased pan. 

Cheese Fondu 

I cup milk 

I cup bread crumbs

FISH 

Serve fish once or twice a week instead of meat. 
Below is a list of moderate priced fish : 

''Market Cod" 6 cents— 8 cents 

Haddock . 7 " 

Weakfish lo " 

Flounder lO " 

Porgies lo " 20 '* 

The "Market Cod" is only for boiling. 

27 



When cooking fish always save head and bones with some 
meat dinging to them, and make them into a fish stock. Fish 
stock is made just as meat stock is: cover bones and head 
with cold water; bring to boiling point and simmer one or two 
hours; this can be thickened with flour, seasoned with parsley, 
and, with milk added, it becomes a very good ''cream of fish." 
Add seasoning, milk and thickening to suit the taste. 

Boiled fresh cod or haddock: Cook in boiling salted water until 
flesh is tender. This may be served with a milk sauce, with one 
or two chopped hard boiled eggs in it. Fish may be baked, 
broiled or fried, but the richer varieties are expensive. 

Salmon Loaf"^ 

Mince one can of salmon and add one cup of stale bread 
crumbs, one Qgg beaten stiff, ^ cup milk. Season with salt, 
pepper and minced parsley, bake thirty minutes. 

Canned salmon is economical, as there is no waste. 

Codfish Hash 

1 cup salt fish, shredded 

2 cups diced boiled potatoes 
^2 teaspoon of pepper 

j4 tablespoon of melted dripping. 

Mash potatoes, stir into fish, place in pan with enough melted 
fat to moisten mixture, heat thoroughly, brown on both sides 
and serve. Codfish should always be freshened by pouring on 
boiling water until salt is washed out. Do not soak nor boil. 

Creamed Codfish 

Pick up codfish, freshen by pouring on boiling water, do not 
soak. When fish is freshened to suit taste, place it in pan, 
sprinkle with flour, cover with cold milk, cook, stirring constantly 
until soft and thick. Season. 

EGGS 

For a large part of the year eggs are very expensive, but 
during the months when they are reasonable in price, they 
* Home Science Cook Book. 

28 



should be used as often as possible, especially for children. Eggs 
do the same thing for us as meat, that is, give us strength. In 
cooking eggs take care not to use extreme heat, as this hardens 
the white and makes it indigestible. 

Scalloped Eggs 

■ Chop hard-boiled eggs, moisten with white sauce, add equal 
parts soft crumbs and brown in oven, after sprinkling top with 
crumbs. 

Boiled Eggs 

Plunge eggs in boiling water, cover, place on back of stove 
and allow to remain for five to ten minutes, according to degree 
of hardness desired, or — place in cold water and bring to boiling 
point. 

Scrambled Eggs 

Break eggs into a bowl, add one tablespoon of milk for each 
Qgg, beat with fork, pour into greased frying pan, add salt and 
pepper, and cook until creamy, stirring constantly. Be very 
careful not to cook eggs until they are hard.

hot milk, which has been thickened with corn starch. Cook in 
small sauce pan set in pan of hot water until mixture thickens 
and coating forms on a spoon. Strain and cool. 

SOUPS 

Directions for making beef soup are given in the chapter on 
meats (page 23). Vegetable soup may be made of dried vegetable 
pulp, with milk for a foundation, and fresh vegetables may be 
used in the same way.

VEGETABLES 

During a large part of the year green vegetables are very ex- 
pensive, but they should be used as often as possible, as they are 
very valuable in keeping the blood in good order. Some vege- 
tables also contain mineral matter which is useful in building 
up the bones. Spinach, carrots and onions are among the most 
valuable. Lettuce, peas, string beans are also useful. A simple 
salad of fresh or cold cooked vegetables should be used as 
often as possible. Dress the salad with a dressing like this : 

French Dressing 

Yi teaspoon salt 

34 teaspoon pepper 
2 tablespoons vinegar 
4 tablespoons olive oil 
Stir or beat material until well mixed. 

HOW TO COOK \^EGETABLES. 

Nearly all vegetables contain a woody substance which must 
be softened before the vegetable is fit for food. They also con- 
tain starch which if put to cook in cold water becomes like paste, 
but if started in boiling water is easily digested. Salt should be 
added at the start to improve the flavor. 

* Miss Farmer. 

31 



Dried vegetables should be soaked over night if possible. This 
shortens the time needed for cooking. 

Any cold boiled vegetables may be stewed in milk, according to- 
directions for creamed codfish. (See page 28.) 

FRUITS 

Bananas are nourishing, and if ripe will not harm any child 
who is strong and well. 

Baked Bananas 

Bananas can be very 4uickly baked. This makes them sweet 
and more easily digested. They are safe in this form for many 
children who would be injured by raw bananas. Peel before 
baking. 

Bananas With Lemon Juice 

Make a syrup of lemon juice and sugar. Pour over sliced 
bananas, cover with plate and let stand for thirty minutes. This 
is a good dessert. 

Dates 

Dates are nourishing and may be eaten with bread or added to 
cereals. 

Prunes 

Prunes are excellent for children. Wash the prunes and stew 
slowly until they will fall away from the stones. 

Dried Apples 

Dried apples make a good sauce and apple puddings. 
Scalloped apples and huckleberry pudding are prepared like 
apple pudding. 

Fruit Toast 

Any stewed fruit, sweetened and poured over toast, while hot. 
Watch the market and buy fruit fresh or dried, whenever 
you have a few cents to spare.

CEREALS 



Points to Remember 

( 1 ) Have water boiling 

(2) Add salt 

(3) Sift cereal in slowly 

(4) Cook over fire until thickening begins 

(5) Place kettle in larger kettle containing boiling water, 
and cook several hours, according to kind. It may be 
cooked over night. 

(6) Different kinds of cereals need different amounts of 
water. A general rule is two and a half times as much 
water as grain, and a teaspoon of salt for every quart of 
water. 

Chopped dates may be added to cooked mush. This 
makes a good dessert.

able, as they furnish two of the necessary kinds of food, sugar 
and starch. 

Bread and jelly or bread and molasses make a good dessert 
for children.

DRINKS 

Water is very necessary to the health of the body; you should 
drink at least four glasses a day. 

Nearly everyone uses either tea or coffee. These will not harm 
grown people, if they are used moderately, but children should 
never have either tea or coffee. 

WHY TEA AND COFFEE HARM CHILDREN 

I. Tea and coffee give a feeling of rest when insufficient food 
has been taken. This is what we call stimulation. What we mean 
is that the nerves have been acted upon so that we feel refreshed 
although we have received no real strength such as comes to us 
from food. When children's nerves are abused in this way, they 
will be irritable and weak, and apt to become ill. 

2. Tea and coffee, if used to excess, weaken the kidneys. 

3. Coffee affects the heart and is dangerous if the heart is 
weak. Badly made tea is a real poison for both children and 
grown people. Follow directions very carefully. 

DRINKS IN PLACE OF TEA AND COFFEE 
Milk — A real food. Makes blood and strength. 

39 



*' Cambric Tea" — Equal parts of hot milk and water sweetened 
to taste. 

Cocoa — A food drink. Makes flesh, heat, and strength. 

Cereal Coffee — A drink for variety. Will not affect the nerves. 

Cocoa Shells. — The outside of the cocoa bean ground fine, not 
a food, but an excellent drink. 

RULES FOR MAKING HOT DRINKS 

Coffee. — I heaping tablespoon of coffee for each cup. Measure 
amount of water needed, add half of this cold to coffee,

The kitchen sink needs special care. Keep it absolutely free 
from refuse and grease. Two or three times a week pour round 
the drain a solution of washing soda in boiling water. 

The Kitchen Cloths 

Unclean dish cloths cause disease. After each using, dish cloth 
and towels should be washed in soap and water and rinsed in 
scalding water, then dried thoroughly. This treatment will keep 
them sweet and clean. 

Insects 

Perfect cleanliness will help you to keep free from water bugs, 
but if they do get into the kitchen, they may be driven away by 
sprinkling powdered borax in all crevices around the sink. Be 
careful to keep all food under cover, as the odors of food attract 
bugs quickly.

to the ice. 

(2) Once a week, cleanse all parts of the food compartment 
with soap and hot water. 

(3) Never put warm food away in the refrigerator. 

(4) Do not allow milk and butter to stand uncovered beside 
fruit or vegetables, as they will absorb flavors and odors. 

(5) Keep dishes absolutely clean. 

(6) Go through the refrigerator every day, to use up remnants 
of food while still fresh, and to keep every part in order. 

WASTE 

Be careful not to waste any food. Use trimmings of meat for 
soup. 

Save dry bread for making dried crumbs to be used in many 
ways. 

Use small amount of cereals and vegetables in soup.
