{As Compiled from Data of Record by the Undersigned^) 

Nothing was further from Mr. Ewell's thoughts than going 
into the milk business when, many years ago, he loaned a rela- 
tive and friend some money to engage in the business. Their 
subsequent failure forced him to take the business to secure 
himself. Becoming interested after a little experience, Mr. 
Ewell soon found out, what few people knew, viz. : That but a 
small proportion of the milk sold in this city is absolutely 
pure, and the idea occurred to him that a large and profitable 
business might be built up by furnishing such an article. Not 
knowing the meaning of the word fail, he commenced experi- 
menting. Starting with the idea that young, healthy cows, 
with plenty of good, wholesome food, fresh air, pure water, 
.good pasture and proper treatment, would produce the best 
milk, and having all these requisites to start with, at his 800- 
acre ranch, seven miles from the city, on the San Bruno road, 
Mr. Ewell for years experimented with all kinds of feed (for 
be it known that good pasture alone does not produce the rich- 
est milk, as most every one thinks), both ground and dry, his 
experience teaching him finally that cooked food gave better 
results than dry, and that corn, wheat, Egyptian corn, bran, 
peas, beans, broomcorn seed and middlings, in their seasons, in 
various combinations, cooked to the consistency of mush, with 
plenty of squash when in season, cut fine and fed green, giving a 
cow all she can eat twice a day, with plenty of good Bur clover 
hay for a change, is the best. This liberal feeding, with good 
pasture, has enabled Mr. Ewell to produce a milk richer and 
superior to the production of any other dairy, as the analysis 
of two of the most prominent analytical chemists of this city 
(which will be given hereafter) will sufficiently demonstrate, 
their samples being taken at their own volition, at widely 
different dates. 

Having satisfied himself as to the quality of his milk, Mr. 
Ewell took for his motto : 

' ' The Purest and Best in the World, ' ' 

And then turned his attention to its delivery to consumers, 
and the best means of getting it to them as pure and fresh as 
when it leaves the cow, for it must be admitted that the old 
system of delivering milk has disadvantages that should have 
condemned it long ago, for its lack of cleanliness and its oppor- 
tunities for contamination, and Mr. Ewell firmly believes that, 
with all his care and trouble, and efforts to produce the best of 
milk, his business would have been a failure had he adhered 
to the old system of delivery. 

Bottling milk warm from the cow is an original idea of Mr. 
Ewell, and to its adoption, two years ago, Mr. Ewell attributes

the wonderful success of his business, it having increased from. 
500 quart- customers a day, to over 4500, and there seems to be 
hardly any limit to its possible extension, so popular is it with 
all who have tried it, together with the exceeding richness of 
the milk. 

AN INCORPORATED COMPANY. 

About the time of introducing this system of delivering 
milk, Mr. Ewell, in order to get the most faithful and devoted 
service from his large number of employes, incorporated his 
business, letting all of them, who desired, have stock, at a 
mere nominal rate, at which price he will either buy or sell to 
them, at any time, thus encouraging his men to save their 
wages, and at the same time make one per cent, per month on 
their savings. This system has worked so well that most all of 
his employes are now interested in the business. The company 
is known as the K well's X. L,. Dairy Bottled Milk Company, 
and while paying one per cent, per month dividends, as before 
stated, since its incorporation, has accumulated a large surplus 
fund of over $5000, a most wonderful showing in so short a 
time. The headquarters in this city are at the northwest corner 
of Folsom and Twenty-first streets, where also are located their 
large stables for the fifty horses and delivery wagons, and where 
are accommodations for as many of the men to sleep, as may 
desire. C. P. JONKS.

MESSRS. EWELL & Co., SAN FRANCISCO : 

Gentlemen I have made a careful chemical analysis of your milk, and have 
visited your dairy in San Mateo county. I have also investigated your 
methods for supplying fresh and pure milk to your customers, and can affirm 
that I commend your idea of bottling your milk immediately after its removal 
from the cows, and then put into bottles, thoroughly cleansed with boiling 
water, in order to secure the destruction of organic germs. I find that your 
milk, at ordinary temperature and atmospheric conditions, still retains its, 
amphisteric reaction on litmus paper for fully 36 hours, showing the value of 
your method in securing and retaining the characters of unchanged and fresh, 
milk during this period. 

I would further state that I have used your bottled milk in my family during 
the past two years with perfect satisfaction . 

The following is the result of my analysis of an average sample, which 
proves that it is fully up to the standard of a pure article :

YOUNG AND OLD IN HEALTH AND IN SICKNESS IT MAKES 
TEETH, BONE, MUSCLES AND BRAINS. 



Milk has been, since the dawn of Pastoral life, one of the 
chief mainstays of mankind, in health and in sickness. Two 
substances in daily use contain, each of them, the elements 
necessary to support life. The first is milk, which consists 
of carbonaceous, nitrogenous and phosphatic elements in a 
watery menstruum; the second is wheat, provided that the 
flour used is Graham, or unbolted. 

Strange to say, however, they are, of all food stuffs, the 
most reduced in nutritive quality. The milk by watering, 
skimming, and the substitution of that of sickly or ill-fed 
cows. The wheat, by the process of manufacturing fine white 
flour, whereby it is deprived of almost all nitrogenous and 
phosphatic elements. 

For infants, milk is the only safe, and therefore requisite 
diet. Before eight months, the glands which secrete the fluid 
by which starchy flood is digested, have not developed. The 
success which the lower animals have in rearing their young to 
maturity, ought to be a lesson to our boasted civilization, where 
nearly one half of the children die before reaching the age of 
five years. Milk, pure and simple, should be given to infants, 
properly diluted and sweetened. And to children, with insist- 
ance that it be drank slowly, and in much larger quantity than 
is usual. Sugar, 'molasses, butter, arrowroot, white flour, 
etc., which the latter unfortunates are generally fed on, do not 
contain any tooth, bone, muscle or brain-forming elements; 
their constituents are carbonaceous, fat-forming and heat-giving, 
and, given in excess, increase the tendency to inflammatory 
affections. 

Milk from the cow, can be rendered very similar to human 
milk, when we take into consideration the distinctive charac- 
teristics of the two, the difference being that the former con- 
tains more casein (nitrogenous material) and less sugar than the 
latter. 

Prepared milk, for infants, can be made as follows: If we 
heat milk very gently, a thin skin will form on the surface; this 
is casein, and, by skimming it off one or more times, we de- 
prive the milk of any desired proportion, each infant's digest- 
ive power being the most correct guide. The best method of 
sweetening is to use sugar of milk, the properties of which are 
entirely different from cane sugar; it can be readily obtained 
from any druggist. The temperature at which milk, at all 
ages, should be given, is important; it ought to be 95 F.

The source of supply from which the city family receives its 
milk, should be chosen with great consideration; the health of 
the children, and the comfort of parents and guardians, depend 
upon the milk being sweet and pure. The cows should be well 
fed, healthy, and surrounded by good sanitary conditions. 
The milk should be immediately strained and placed in some 
cool, cleanly apartment, where germs of disease and fatal 
emanations can not reach it. Nothing takes up the evils of 
the surrounding atmosphere more quickly or surely than milk; 
it forms a culture fluid for them when introduced, and, as a 
large proportion of registered deaths are attributed to the lower- 
ing of the vitality of the masses by the use of vitiated and 
improper food, it is undoubtedly necessary to exercise care in 
this case at least. Moreover, it is now a well-ascertained fact, 
that disease and poisonous material from certain herbs can be 
taansmitted from the cow through the milk. A great question 
of the day is, the communicability of disease from animals to 
mankind; it promises to be a still greater one in the future. 
The science of the prevention of disease is in its infancy, that 
of the treament of disease, has been, in many instances, a gre- 
vious failure. 

Not a word can be said in favor of keeping a dairy within 
city limits; want of space and proper ventilation for the cows, 
the dangers of contamination to the milk, and the water, often 
impure, which is added, render the risk so great that many 
Boards of Health prohibit it altogether. 

For young children, the milk of the cow furnishes the most 
proper elements of nutrition. In selecting the food to accom- 
pany it, much will depend upon the inherited tendencies and 
constitution of the child. Should it be fat, .heavy and stupid, 
too much carbonaceous food such as white flour, butter, 
sugar and cream are being given; on the other hand, is a child 
precocious (and such is acknowledgedly the most difficult to 
rear), lean meat, oaten meal, cracked wheat, and other highly 
nitrogenous and phosphatic articles of food tend to develop the 
muscles and brain too rapidly. These are the two extremes, 
and between them, there is a large range of other children 
whose dieting likewise requires judgment and care. Milk, 
and, as a rule, Graham bread, lean meats, fish, fruit and vege- 
tables, should not be neglected; white bread, sugar, butter, 
preserves and fat meats may. 

For the sick, we must be careful to have milk very sweet 
and fresh; it is better to obtain the milk twice daily, having 
the morning delivery for use during the day, and the evening 
supply for night time. It is usual to skim it in intestinal dis- 
orders, as the cream is not always digested. It may be pep- 
tonized by the following process, for sometimes the greatest 
dangers arise from the stomach and pancreas suddenly striking 
work. 

Pancreatized Milk. Milk is digested in great part in the 
small intestines; there it is acted on by the pancreatic secre-

addition of wine or vinegar. 

To Fry Clams. 

Get them from the shell and thoroughly clean them, lay them on a double 
napkin to dry out the water ; then roll a few at a time in wheat flour, until 
they will take no more, have ready a frying pan with plenty of hot salted 
lard, lay close together and fry gently until one side is a delicate brown, then 
turn carefully and brown the other side, then place on a hot dish, garnish with 
parsley. 

Boil Clams. 

Wash the clams until perfectly clean, put them into a kettle, add a pint of 
water, set them over a brisk fire ; when the shells open they are done. When 
done take them from the shell, toast some thin slices of bread, butter them 
and cut them small, and put them in a deep dish ; place the hot or warm 
v olams over the toast bread with some of the clam juice.

tion, which is akaline add to one pint of milk five grains of 
Pancreatic Ext. (Fairchild's), and 15 grains Bicarbonate of 
Soda, having previously dissolved them in a little water. Put 
in a bottle and immerse it in hot, not boiling, water. Cover 
carefully in order to retain the heat, and allow it to stand in a 
warm place for an hour and a-half. At the end of this time, 
the product will be found of a greyish, yellow color, much 
thinner, and with a bitter taste. By placing it on ice, or in 
boiling water, the digestive process can be stopped, and it may 
be kept like ordinary milk. In many acute diseases such as 
typhoid and scarlet fever, milk is largely given. In the former, 
its value is extreme, and in the latter, owing to milk having 
diuretic properties, albuminuvia is less likely to occur. 

A Milk Diet. In chronic diseases much attention has of 
late years been paid to a steady milk diet. This has been par- 
ticularly the case in London, where dyspepsia, gastralgia, chronic 
diarrhoea, dysentry, gastric catarrh, ascites, anasarca, albumin- 
uria, diabetes, eczema, gout and gouty affections have been 
effectually removed by the use of milk alone. 

Great resolution on the part of the patient is necessary, be- 
cause, as a rule, though taken readily at first, it soon begins to 
pall upon the appetite, and a distressing sense of emptiness is 
felt at the pit of the stomach. The mouth becomes pasty, and 
the tongue coated with a whitish fur. Constipation, more or 
less obstinate, is not unusual; when diarrhoea occurs it is a sign 
that the milk is disagreeing with the patient and peptonized 
milk or koumiss may be tried. Weight is lost at first, and the 
pulse quickens, the arterial tension being much lowered. After 
a time, however, the waste ceases and the pulse becomes normal. 
Weakness is often experienced, in fact a certain degree is usual; 
this need not cause alarm. In rare cases vertigo and faintness 
occur. Usually, however, but little trouble is experienced. 

Four ounces may be taken every three hours at the com- 
mencement of the treatment, the amount being gradually in- 
creased until the patient can take all he or she can assimilate, 
the milk being slightly warmed and drank slowly. Some phy- 
sicians, soon after the patient has ceased to lose weight, make 
a gradual change to a mixed diet; they commence at the end of 
the third week and gradually increase the quantity of solid food 
until the end of the sixth week, after which time a full mixed 
diet, consisting largly of milk, may be continued for a number 
of months, 

Finely formed men and women, having good teeth, lungs, 
muscles and brains, would be much less uncommon were the 
milk of the cow, unskimmed and unadulterated, to enter more 
largely into the dietary of infants, children, and growing lads 
and lasses. I cannot urge too strongly the use in every house- 
hold of pure milk and Graham bread.

added to thicken; season with about one tablespoonful of butter, salt and pep- 
per to taste. Have ready small paste pans lined with good puff paste. Bake 
the crust in a brisk oven, then fill the pans and set in the oven a few minutes 
to brown over slightly. 

M^orced Meat Rails. 

Mix with one pound of chopped veal or meat one egg, a little butter, one 
cup of bread crumbs, the whole to be well moistened with EWELL'S X. L. 
DAIRY BOTTLED MILK; season with salt and red pepper, make up in 
small balls and fry them brown. 

Chicken Cheese. 

Two chickens boiled tender, chop fine or picked in small pieces, salt and 
pepper to taste; three eggs boiled and sliced, line dishes or moulds with them; 
add to the chicken and liquor they were boiled in three tablespoons EWELL'S 
X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM, pour in the moulds the chicken and 
liquor; when cold, slice. Boil in as little water as possible. 

Chicken Pie No. 1.

To Choose a Goose. 

Be careful in choosing a goose that it is young; an old goose is very poor 
fare. If the skin and joints are tender and easily broken, it is young. The 
bill and feet of a young goose are yellow, in an old one they are red. 

To Roast a Goose. 

Pick it clean, cut off the legs at the joints, and singe it nicely ; wash the in- 
side of the body with cold water ; rub it with a mixture of salt and pepper ; 
prepare the stuffing. Cut one loaf of wheat bread in slices, pour over one 
pint EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTIED MILK, to wet ; then add a tea- 
spoon of salt, the same of pepper, and a quarter of a pound of butter, with a 
tablespoonful of sage, a little thyme, if liked. Fill the body, then sew up 
the slit, tie the ends of the legs together, put a pint of water in the pan to baste 
with ; have a steady fire, allow fifteen minutes for each pound of meat. 

Gravy. 

If the gravy is very fat take some of it off ; put the pan over the fire, then 
stir into it a thin batter of a tablespoonful of flour wet with EWELL'S X. L. 
DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, stir it until it is brown and smooth, and pour it 
through a strainer into a gravy tureen. 

Pigeon Pie. 

Make a fine paste ; lay a border of it arotmd a dish, and cover the bottom 
with a veal cutlet ; season with salt, cayenne pepper and mace. Prepare as, 
many pigeon as can be put in one layer in the dish ; put in each pigeon a small 
lump of butter, season with pepper and salt; lay them in the dish, breast 
downward, cut in slices half a dozen hard-boiled eggs and lay in with the 
birds ; put in one-half pint EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, and 
cover the whole with crust. Bake one hour and a-half. 

Roast Goose. 

Stuff and roast in the same manner as duck. Cover the goose with a paste 
of flour and water, while baking. Make a sauce with the drippings in the 
pan in which the game is roasted, thicken the gravy with brown flour moist- 
ened with EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK. 

Quail on Toast. 

Cut the birds open down the back, salt and pepper them, dredge them with 
flour. Break down the breast and backbone so they will lay flat, place them 
in a pan with butter and very little water in a hot oven, covering them up 
tightly until nearly done ; then place them in a spider in hot butter and fry 
to a nice brown. Have ready slices of baker's bread, toasted, upon a platter, 
on this place the quail. Make a sauce in the pan. thickened lightly with 
brown flour moistened with EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, and 
pour over each quail and the tuast. 

Rice Chicken. 

Place a full grown chicken and about one pound of pickled pork, with a 
pod of red pepper and a bunch of thyme, in a pot with water enough to cover. 
When perfectly tender put the chicken and pork in a steamer which fits the 
pot ; wash your rice and boil it seventeen minutes in the water from which 
the meat was taken ; make a gravy tureen full of drawn butter sauce, to 
which you add two hard-boiled eggs sliced, and capers ; use about one pint of 
EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK for the sauce. When you 
serve place the rice on a large flat dish and chicken on top. 

Duck. 

When roasted, use dressing as for turkeys with the addition of a few 
slices of onions. Make a sauce with the drippings in the pan in which the 
game is roasted, and to which are put the chopped giblets which are previ- 
ously well cooked. Thicken t,he gravy with brown flour moistened with 
EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK. Serve with currant jelly. 



Chicken Pie with Sweet Potatoes. 

Cut up a chicken and put it on to stew ; and after it has boiled for a while, 
add six medium sized sweet potatoes peeled and cut in halves. Stew until 
tender, and then place the pieces of chicken and potatoes alternately in a deep 
pie dish lined with crust. Season with salt and pepper, little onion, and the 
gravy furnished by stewing the chicken and potato ; cover with crust and 
bake. 

Poultry Croquettes. 

Melt a small piece of butter in a stew pan ; put into it chopped parsley 
and mushrooms, two teaspoonfuls of flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg, fry it and 
pour in half -pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, or better, 
cream, cut up any poultry which has been cooked the day before into dice, 
put them into the sauce and let it get cold; form it into balls, and cover them 
with bread crumbs, wash them in eggs which have been beaten up, and roll 
them in bread crumbs second time. Fry them to a light brown ; serve with 
parsley. 

Wild l>iick. 

All wild duck which have a fishy taste before roasting should be parboiled 
with a small carrot put within each, which will absorb the unpleasant taste. 
Chop apples fine and stuff them for roasting, gives them a much nicer flavor 
than the ordinary stuffing. 

Pressed Chicken. 

Clean, wash and cut the fowl in small pieces ; place them in a kettle with 
a tight cover ; put in two cups of water, salt and pepper ; let it cook slowly 
until the meat cleans from the bones ; shred all the meat (freed from skin, 
bones and gristle) about as for chicken salad, season well, put into a deep dish 
and pour the remnant of the juice in which it was cooked over it. This will 
be : jelly when cold and can then be sliced ; it will not jelly if too much 
water is put over. Do not HL\OW the water to boil away entirely while 
cooking. 

To make si irl's Nest. 

Boil some macaroni gently until it is quite tender ; have it in about five 
inch pieces, and lay them on a dish like a straw nest. Truss pigeons with the 
heads on (having picked and clean); turn under the left wing; leave the feet 
on, and having stewed them, arrange them as in a nest ; pour the gravy over 
and serve. The nest may be made of bread cut in pieces the length and thick- 
ness of the macaroni and fried a light brown in hot lard ; season with pepper 
and salt. Any small bird may be stewed and served in this way. 

*Vicassee of Chicken. 

Scald and skin, cut into joints, place in a stew pan with one good sized 
raw onion cut in slices, a litlle chopped parsley, salt and pepper, add butter 
about the size of an egg, and fill in a pint of water ; cover close and stew for 
an hour and half over a slow fire, then lift and strain off the gravy, into which 
beat gradually a half pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM 
and the yolk of one egg ; heat up the gravy, but not boil, and pour it over the 
fricassee. 

Roast Prairie Chicken. 

The flesh being very dry should be either larded, or better, wide strips of 
bacon or pork placed over the breast. A mild seasoning stuffing will improve 
the flavor of the birds : dust a little flour over them. Baste often. 

Curry Chicken. 

Slice an onion and brown in a little butter ; add a teaspoonful of curry 
powder ; cover for a few minutes to cook ; add a little more butter and put in 
chicken cut up in small pieces; thicken with a little flour. A good way to 
freshen up cold chicken or veal. Rice is excellent with curry chicken.

Roast Beef. 

Prepare for the oven by dredging lightly with flour and seasoning with salt 
and pepper ; place in the oven and baste frequently while roasting. Allowing 
a quarter of an hour for a pound of meat, if you like it rare, longer if well 
done. Serve with a sauce made from the drippings in the pan, to which has 
been added three tablespoons of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM. 
Thicken with brown flour and serve in a gravy boat. 

Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding. 

Set a piece of beef to roast upon a grating, or several sticks laid across a 
dripping-pan. (Allow fifteen minutes to a pound.) Three quarters of an hour 
before it is done, mix the pudding and pour into the pan. Continue to roast 
the beef, the dripping meanwhile falling upon the pudding below. When both 
are done cut the pudding into squares and lay around the meat when dished. 
Drain off most of the fat from the pan before putting the pudding in. 

Recipe for Pudding One pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK, four eggs, whites and yolks, beaten separately ; two cups of flour, one 
teaspoon salt. Be carefulin mixing not to get the batter too stiff. 

Yorkshire Pudding. 

To be eaten with roast beef instead of a vegetable: Three tablespoons 
flour, mixed with one pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK ; 
three eggs and a little salt. Pour into a shallow baking pan ; put into oven, 
an hour before dinner, for ten minutes ; then put it under the roasting beef 
and leave it till you take up the beef ; leave it in about five minutes after you 
take up the beef. 

Boiling. 

Before boiling joints of meat it should be decided whether the juices are 
g o into the water, as in soup and gravies, or to be retained in the meat it- 
self. If they are to be retained, put the meat into fast boiling water, and let 
it boil for fifteen minutes, and thus prevent the juice from escaping ; after, let 
it boil moderately until done. Care must be taken to remove the scum when 
the water is on the point of boiling. If you wish to extract the juice from raw 
meat, cover it with cold water and simmer slowly. 

Boiled ,> of Mutton. 

Wash nicely a leg of mutton ; put it into a pot and cover it with boiling 
water ; add a little salt. Allow it to boil five minutes ; skim clean ; let it boil 
slowly until done ; time two hours to two and a half. Mutton is much im- 
proved by hanging up two or three days before using, four or five in cool 
weather. 

The liqiior from the boiling may be converted into a soup by adding three 
grated potatoes, pepper, seasoning to taste. 

Mutton Broth for the Sick. 

Boil a piece of mutton until it will fall from the bones ; then strain off the 
broth, let it cool, skim off the fat ; add salt and swelled rice ; cook gently for 
twenty minutes. 

Curry Mutton. 

Put six small onions, cut fine, and an ounce of butter into a saucepan 
with an ounce of curry powder, a teaspoonful of salt, one of flour, and half a 
pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM; stir until smooth. 
Cut two pounds of mutton into small pieces, and fry a light brown; put the 
meat into a saucepan, pour the sauce over it and boil gently for one hour and 
a half; place the meat on a hot dish, and arrange a border of hard boiled eggs, 
cut in thick slices, around it. 

Veal may be used instead of mutton, or cold meats, with less cooking. 



30 

Roast Veal. 

Prepare a leg of veal for the oven by washing, drying and larding it with 
strips of fat bacon, and dredging it with flour, seasoning with pepper and salt; 
baste frequently and serve with the gravy thickened. A roast fillet of veal 
should be prepared by stuffing it with bread crumbs, well wet with EWELL'S 
X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, seasoned with chopped ham, summer 
savory, salt and pepper. 

Shoulder of Veal. 

Put a piece of butter the size of an egg into a kettle; put it on the stove. 
When this begins to fry, put in the veal, season it, and let it fry until done 
brown- then add water sufficient to cook it. When done, thicken EWELL'S 
X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM with flour and stir well. Two pounds 
of veal will make a dinner for six. 

Veal Pie. 

Three pounds of lean veal, two slices of salt pork, chopped fine, one cup 
of bread crumbs, two eggs, salt and pepper to taste; mix thoroughly with one- 
half cup EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK; bake one hour and a 
half. Use cold as a relish. 

Veal JLoaf. 

Three pounds raw veal, one half pound raw salt pork chopped fine, three 
Boston crackers rolled fine, three eggs, little mace, little sage, one teaspoon 
black pepper, one of salt. Make into a loaf, and baste while baking, with 
butter the size of an egg melted in a little of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOT- 
TLED MILK. Put outside of the loaf a small quantity of rolled crackers. 
Bake three hours. Is very nice cold, cut in thin slices. 

Filled Veal. 

Boil the veal tender, pick it up fine, put in a mould; add to the water in 
which it was boiled a little flour, well mixed with EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY 
BOTTLED MILK, seasoned with salt and pepper; a layer of hard boiled eggs 
improves it. 

Fricoudeau. 

Three pounds of cold roast veal chopped fine, one teaspoon of salt, one of 
pepper, one-half nutmeg, five rolled crackers, three eggs, butter the size of an 
egg, tablespoon of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTILED MILK. Form this 
into a roll, and spot it over with bits of butter; then strew over it the pounded 
crackers, put in the oven, and from time to time add a little water. Cook 
slowly for two hours. 

Iate of Veal. 

Three pounds of leg of veal fat and lean, chopped fine, seven small crackers 
rolled fine, two eggs, piece of butter the size of an egg, one teaspoon salt, one 
of pepper, and one of nutmeg, a slice of salt pork chopped fine ; work all to- 
gether with a little of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, in the 
form of a loaf. Bake two hours ; to slice when cold. 

Veal Cutlets a la Fried Oysters. 

Cut the veal into pieces three inches square, dry with a towel, season to 
taste ; have ready a beaten egg and crackers rolled fine, each on separate 
dishes ; dip each piece of the cutlet in the egg, then in the rolled cracker ; 
have enough lard or butter hot in your pan so as to cover the cutlets. A rich 
gravy can be made after the meat is done by adding a little of EWELL'S X. 
L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK. 

Veal I, oaf. 

Six Boston crackers, three eggs, one tablespoon of salt, pepper and sage, 
three pounds of veal. The veal must be raw and chopped fine ; mix all well 
together and pack it hard in a deep pan, bake slowly for one hour. Two table- 
spoons of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM improves it. Nice 
for tea, sliced thin when cold. 



31 

Sauce 'rsiristr.

and cover with cold water, add half cup of vinegar and let it simmer for half 
an hour, then place it in cold water a few minutes, dry each piece, rub sweet 
oil on them and broil, when done lay bits of butter on them with juice of half 
a lemon. 

Sweet Bread. 

Choose white sweet breads, put them in warm water to draw out the blood, 
let them remain one hour, then put them in boiling water, let them simmer fif- 
teen minutes, take them out, drain them, and dip them in egg and then in 
bread crumbs, drop on them a little melted butter and put into a moderately 
heated oven, let them bake three-quarters of an hour ; serve them on toasted 
bread and pour over a gravy.

AN INTERESTING LETTER. 
PURE MILK PUT TO THE TEST. 



SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., January 2, 1888. 
L. J. Ewell & Co., Proprietors XL Dairy, 

Twenty-first and Folsom Sts., San Francisco 
GENTLEMEN : Having obtained samples of milk from your 
dairy through various sources for chemical analysis, as 
requested by you, the same has been exhaustively examined, 
and I give herein its chemical constituents. The mere tabu- 
lated statement of the result would be unintelligible, except to 
chemists, without some practical comparison. That you may 
understand the more clearly, permit me to first present the 
accepted analysis of the average milk that is consumed in the 
United States, according to the National Dispensatory, by Stille 
& Maisch, which is the recognized authority. Of course, it 
varies in all animals according to the time that elapsed since 
the birth of its offspring, but the average chemical constituents 
of the milk from the cow are : 

Albuminoids 4.1 

Fat, Butter 4.0 

Milk, Sugar 4.2 

Salts (chiefly phosphates) 0.7 

Total Solids 13.0 

Water 87.0 

Total 100.0 

A careful analysis of .the samples of milk from your dairy 
developed the following constituents : 

Albuminoids 5.0 

Fat, Butter 5.1 

Milk, Sugar 4.8 

Salts '. 0.7 

Total Solids - 15.6 

Water 84.4 

Total 100. o 

Of course, it goes without saying that as between two sani- 
pies, that is the purest and best milk that contains the most of 
the wholesome solids and the least water. Thus the advantage 
in your favor from the above figures is 20 per cent. Your sam- 
ple develops one-fifth more solids, and, of course, proportion- 
ally less water, than the average sample of pure milk ; in 
other words, one-fifth or 20 per cent, better than the established 
average. Respectfully yours,

A Valuable Suggestion. 

Soak your ham or salt pork (cut in slices for boiling or frying) in a quart 
of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK over night for breakfast. The 
milk may be either fresh or sour. 

>i<-<> Breakfast Dish. 

Chopped cold meat well seasoned ; wet with gravy, put it on a platter ; 
then take cold rice made moist with EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK and one egg, season with pepper and salt ; if not sufficient rice add 
powdered bread crumbs ; place this around the platter quite thick ; set it in 
the oven to heat and brown. 

Glutton Hash with Poached Kggs. 

Take a pound of the remains of roast mutton, chop it fine and put it into 
a stewpan with a cupful of mutton gravy ; season with pepper and salt and 
little grated nutmeg, add a teaspoonful of flour, and let the meat heat grad- 
ually until hot ; do not let it boil ; simmer 20 minutes and serve with poached 
eggs placed around the dish. 

Curry Mutton. 

Put six small onions, cut fine, and an ounce of butter into a saucepan 
with an ounce of curry powder, a teaspoonful of salt, one of flour, and half a. 
pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM ; stir until smooth, cut 
two pounds up into small pieces and fry a light brown ; put the meat into a 
saucepan, pour the sauce over it and boil gently one hour and a half ; place the 
meat on a hot dish and arrange a border of hard boiled eggs, cut in thick slices, 
around it. Veal may be used instead of mutton, or cold meats with less 
cooking. 

Meat from Soup Hones. 

Before putting in the vegetables take out a bowl of the liquor ; take the 
meat from the bones, chop it fine, season with sage, thyme, salt and pepper ; 
pour over the liquor, which should be thick enough to jelly when cold, put 
into molds and serve cold in slices. 

Potato and Beef Hash. 

Mince same cold beef, a little fat with the lean, put to it as much cold 
boiled pototoes as you like, season with pepper and salt ; add as much gravy 
or EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK as will make it moist, then 
put in a stew pan over a gentle fire ; stir it about with a spoon, cover the stew 
pan and let it simmer for fifteen minutes. Dish it with or without a slice of 
toast under it:

Stewed Tripe. 

Soak a pound of tripe all night in cold water; next day wash it in warm 
water with a piece of soda in it the size of a pea, but do not let it soak in this, 
as the soda will harden the tripe. Place the tripe in plenty of cold water and 
boil. If the water has not a pleasant smell put in fresh water and boil again 
Simmer gently for about six hours. Skin and scald two onions; add them one' 
hour before the tripe is ready; mix one ounce of flour with half a pint of EW- 
ELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK; add half a pint of the liquor the tripe 
has been boiled in; boil five minutes, chop the onions, c\it the tripe into neat 
pieces, add to it the sauce with pepper and salt, and serve. 

Sausage Pudding.

in hot water, then throw them into cold water and afterwards remove the 
skins. Line the pudding basin with suet paste, fill it with the sausages, and 
pour upon them the following preparation: Chop one onion and three sage 
leaves; boil these three minutes in water, drain them upon a seive, and then 
fry them in butter. As soon as light brown add a tablespoon of flour and a tea- 
cupful curry paste, season with pepper and salt, and moisten with half a pint 
good broth. Stir the sauce upon the fire, and when boiled fifteen minutes rub 
it through a sieve, and use it as above directed. Cover the pudding with paste, 
bake for two hours, and send to table with plain gravy under it. 

Cheap Meat Pie. 

Cut one-half pound cold meat into thin slices. Skin, scald and slice two 
small onions, and brown them slightly with half an ounce of dripping; pour 
away the dripping, one teaspoonful flour with a little water, add it with the 
rest of the water, one teacupful; also a sprig of herb, a little salt and pepper 
to the onions. Simmer till onions are tender, stirring to prevent flour stick- 
ing to the pan. Remove the sprig and let the sauce cool. Pour it into a pie 
dish; place the pieces of meat in it. Mash one pound cold potatoes, add half 
ounce dripping and one tablespoon EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED

in flat cakes, in the cracker. Fry in butter. 

Beefsteak and Oyster Pie. 

Cut three pounds of rump steaks into large scallops, fry them quickly 
over a very brisk fire, so as to brown them before they are half done ; then 
place them on the bottom of the dish, leaving the center open in two succes- 
sive layers ; fill the center with four dozen oysters prrviously parboiled and 
breaded, season with pepper and salt, and pour the following preparation 
over the whole : when the scallops of beef have been fried in a frying pan,

tHis over the fire for one minute, and then add a pint of good gravy, two table- 
spoonfuls of mushroom catsup and an equal quanty of Harvey sauce and the 
liquor from the oysters. Stir the whole over the fire and keep it boiling for a 
quarter of an ho'ar. Half an hour after this sauce has been poured in the pie

SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., Oct., 23d, 1889. 
MESSRS. EWELL & Co., SAN FRANCISCO : 

Gentlemen I have made a careful chemical analysis of your milk, and have 
visited your dairy in San Mateo county. I have also investigated your 
methods for supplying fresh and pure milk to your customers, and can affirm 
that I commend your idea of bottling your milk immediately after its removal 
from, the cows, and then put into bottles, thoroughly cleansed with boiling 
water, in order to secure the destruction of organic germs. I find that your 
milk, at ordinary temperature and atmospheric conditions, still retains its 
amphioteric reaction on litmus paper for fully 36 hours, showing the value of 
your method in securing and retaining the characters of unchanged and fresh 
milk during this period. 

I would further state that I have used your bottled milk in my family during 
the past two years with perfect satisfaction. 

The following is the result of my analysis of an average sample, which proves 
that it is fully up to the standard of a pure article : 
Butter Fat ......................................................... 4.19

Sauces foi* ]^eat, Etc. 

I>rawn Butter. 

Drawn butter forms the basis of most sauces. From this a r great variety 
may be made, by adding to this different flavors. A good standard receipt for 
drawn butter is as follows : Rub one tablespoon of flour with one-quarter of 
pound of butter ; when well mixed, put in a saucepan with a pint of 
EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK; set it in a dish of boiling water, 
shaking it well until the butter melts and is nearly boiling. If set directly on 
the stove or over the coals, makes the butter oily and spoils it, 

I*arsely Sauce. 

One tablespoon of butter, one teaspoon of flour, rubbed together ; one 
tablespoon parsely, first boiled five minutes in water and squeezed out, two 
cupfuls EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK. Shake over a clear 
fire, one way, until it boils ; add the parsely gradually. 

To Brow HI Flour for Sauces. 

Take some flour into a pan and set it over coals, stir it continually about 
that it may not burn, but nicely browned. Keep it in a dredging box for 
browning gravies. 

To Make Drawn Butter. 

Put half a pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK in a stew- 
pan, and set it over a moderate fire ; put into a bowl a heaping teaspoonful of 
flour, quarter of a pound of butter, little salt ; work these well together with 
the back of a spoon ; then pour into it, stirring it all the the time, half a pint 
of boiling water ; when it is smooth, stir it into the boiling milk ; let it simmer 
for five minutes. 

Parsley Sauce. 

Put one pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK in a stew-pan, 
and set it over a moderate fire ; rub together one tablespoonful of wheat flour 
and two of butter ; then pour into it a little boiling water, stirring all the time ; 
when it is smooth stir it into the boiling milk ; cut a bunch of parsley very 
fine, and stir into drawn butter a few minutes before taking up. 

Ulint Sauce. 

Mix one tablespoon of white sugar to half a teacup of vinegar ; add two 
tablespoons green mint, cut fine ; let it infuse for half an N hour in a cool place 
before sending to the table. Serve with roast lamb or mutton. 

Celery Sauce. 

Mix two tablespoons of flour with half a cut of butter; have ready a pint of 
EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, boiling ; stir the flour and butter 
into the milk ; take three heads of celery, cut into small bits, and boil for a 
few minutes in water, which strain off; put the celery into the melted butter, 
and keep it stirred over the fire for ten minutes. Nice with boiled fowl or 
turkey. 

Cream Sauce. 

Cream together a large tablespoon of butter with a little flour, and put over 
a gentle heat ; add a little chopped parsley, a little grated onion, pepper, salt 
and nutmeg ; when these ingredients are well mixed, add a pint of EWELL'S 
X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM ; let it boil for fifteen minutes. 

Cream Sauce* 

Put in a saucepan one pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, 

set it over a moderate fire ; cream together a large tablespoon of butter and 
one of flour ; add a little chopped parsely, a little grated onion, pepper, salt ; 
mix well together, and stir them into the milk ; cook ten minutes. If used for 
fish, add a little horse radish.

HOW TO TEST IT. 

The importance of knowing, absolutely, that you are getting 
pure milk, is not appreciated as it should be by the citizens of 
San Francisco. For the sake of fifty cents per month, many 
families are taking milk that is very nearly half water, to 
say nothing of the vile compounds that are frequently sold to 
cheap restaurants for milk, that have little of the elements of 
milk about them. The Head of a family, that daily spends from 
ten to fifty cents for cigars or liquor, insists upon his wife, taking 
milk of poor quality, to save fifty cents per month ; thereby 
robbing his children of proper nourishment, if not entirely 
disgusting them with the use of milk as a beverage : for a pint 
of the EWELL X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK will make 
a quart of as good milk, as is regularly served to many families. 
Why, then, is it not of sufficient interest to find out absolutely 
what you are buying ? The politicians cry out for a Milk 
Inspector, to make a place for another lamb ! We assert that 
there is really no need for any such official, as any one can test 
their milk at any time, at an expense of ten cents. The lacto- 
meter, that would ordinarily be used by a milk inspector, could 
not be near so efficacious as the following test, as skimmed milk 
shows a greater density than fresh milk, from which the cream 
has not been taken. 

At the risk of being somewhat verbose, yet to make it so 
perfectly plain, and easy to tell, to a certainty, the quality of 
the milk you are paying for, that the simplest person cannot 
be mistaken if they will only take the trouble to follow these 
directions : 

In the first place, it is necessary to have a standard to go by, 
without which you could hardly compare fair to good milk, 
with the VERY BEST that can be produced. That standard we

Boil three or four white onions until they are tender, and then mince them 
fine : put one pint EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK over to

the minced onion and a tablespoon of flour which has been moistened with 
water ; let it cook in boiling water. 

Oyster Sauce. 

Put half a pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK into a stew- 
pan, set it over a fire ; mix a tablespoon of flour with two of butter ; when the 
milk has boiled put to it a pint of small oysters, then pour into the butter and 
flour half a pint of boiling water, stirring until smooth ; then add to the milk ; 
season with salt and pepper to taste.

the delicate green leaves, shreds the white part like straws; lay this in a glass 
dish in the form of a nest, mince all the white meat of a boiled fowl without 
the skin, and put it in the nest, making a salad dressing thus: Rub the yolks 
of two hard boiled eggs to a smooth paste with a tablespoon of salad oil, add 
to it two teaspoonfuls of mustard, a teaspoon of fine sugar, a large cup of 
strong vinegar, four tablespoons of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK. Make a wreath of the most delicate leaves of the celery around the 
edge of the nest. Pour the dressing over the chicken when ready to serve. 

Suggestion. 

White heart lettuce may be used for the nest instead of celery. EWELL'S 
X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK good for babies. 

Suggestion. 

An old fowl is fit for nothing but soup. EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOT- 
TLED MILK cures dyspepsia. 

Valuable Suggestion. 

Chicken for salad should boil until it parts easily from the bone. It is always 
better to shred it than to cut or chop. Equal parts of butter and salad oil are 
by many preferred to the entire quantity of either. Many use EWELL'S X. 
L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM instead. The addition of the liquor in which 
the fowl is boiled is a great improvement to moisten the salad with. 

Turkey. 

To choose a turkey, a hen turkey is more plump and round, and is best 
for boiling. Be sure and choose EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK. 

Chicken Salad. 

Three chickens chopped fine, both light and dark meat, juice of two 
lemons, eight eggs boiled hard, the whites chop fine and the yolks mashed fine; 
moisten with six teaspoons of melted butter, two of sweet oil, to which add 
one tablespoon of mustard, one of pepper, one of salt, one of sugar, three table- 
spoons of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED CREAM, and lastly add six 
large bunches of celery chopped fine, with sufficient vinegar to moisten the 
whole.

claim to be "The EWELL X. I,. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK." 
Be sure and get it from one of their own wagons, and make no 
mistake on this point, as envious competitors are now selling 
bottled milk, that would not compare with Ewell's, while yet 
very fair milk. After procuring a quart bottle, turn it up 
and down a few times to thoroughly mix the cream with the 
milk, or your test would not be a fair one. Then take five 
glasses or goblets, of ordinary size, and put them in a conve- 
nient place, where they can remain unmolested four or five days. 
Fill No. i with the milk full to the brim, and bear in mind 
that this one is to be your standard of what is pure, rich milk* 
The amount of cream on the top will indicate its richness. 
The balance will simply be, solid clabber, with no appearance of 
water. Fill No. 2 to within a quarter of an inch of the brim, 
No. 3 to within half an inch of the top; No. 4 to within three- 
quarters of an inch, and No. 5 to within one inch, and then fill 
Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 full with pure, clear water. After four or 
five days according as the weather may be warm or cold, 
note the results. Each of the numbers, 2, 3, 4 and 5, will have 
some cream on top; in the bottom of each will be clabber, and 
between the two just the amount of water you put in, and no 
more. After satisfying yourself of the correctness of the test, 
and noting carefully the amount of cream on glass No. i , you 
can test any other milk by setting it aside to turn to clabber, 
the cream on top indicating its proportion of richness, and if 
there is any water between it and the clabber, rest assured it 
was put there by the dealer who supplies you, and you can tell 
whether The EWELL'S X. L- DAIRY BOTTLED MILK is 
worth the difference they charge or not. 

If milk is diluted, over half, the mixture will not clabber, 
but simply get sour, or take a very long time to clabber. As 
only about one-half of all the milk sold in San Francisco is 
fairly pure or good, the importance of testing your milk should 
be apparent to all.

Vegetables. 



Boiled Potatoes. 

Old potatoes are better for being peeled and put in cold water two hours 
before boiling. They should be put into fresh cold water when set over the 
fire. New potatoes should always be put into boiling water, and it is best to 
prepare them just in time for cooking. They are better steamed. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Old potatoes, when unfit for plain boiling, may be mashed; take off all the 
skin and imperfections, and lay them in cold water for one hour; then put 
them into a stew-pan with a teaspoon of salt. Cover with cold water and let 
them boil for half an hour; take them up with a skimmer into a wooden bowl 
and mash them fine. Melt a piece of butter the size of an egg into half a pint 
of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK; mix it with the mashed pota- 
toes until it is thoroughly smooth. The quantity of milk must be in proportion 
to the quantity of potatoes. 

Mashed potatoes may be made a highly ornamental dish. After shaping 
it as taste may direct, turn the edge of the plate with a wreath of celery leaves 
or green parsley. 

Potatoes and Cream. 

Mince cold boiled potatoes fine; put them into a spider with hot butter

over the top.

EWELL'S X. L. DAERY BOTTLKD MILK; stir occasionally that it may 
not burn. Serve hot. This is decidedly the best manner of stewing tomatoes; 
then may add an onion cut fine. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. 

Turn nearly all the juice off from a can of tomatoes; salt and pepper this, 
by the way, and put aside in a cool place for some other day's soup. Put a 
layer of bread crumbs in the bottom of a dish well buttered, on them a layer 
of tomatoes; sprinkle with salt, pepper and some bits of butter, also a little 
sugar; another layer of crumbs, another of tomatoes, seasoned; then a top layer 
of very fine crumbs. Pour over one cup of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOT-

of the Business. 



Some allusion has been made in previous pages to the initial, 
or starting point, of the immense business of The E WELL'S 
X. L- DAIRY BOTTLED MILK CO. From small beginnings 
it has grown to its present proportions in the short space of 
two years and three months. Yet few people who now enjoy 
the luxury of this most excellent milk can have any idea of 
the worry and strain, the vexations and disappointments of 
years of experiments to bring it to its present high standard. 
Only those who have stood by Mr. Ewell in these years of trial 
can appreciate the triumph he now enjoys. Step by step, 
month by month, and year by year, regardless of expense, he 
has bent his mind to the work of producing milk so rich in all 
the essentials of a perfectly pure article that competition seems 
to be almost out of the question. 

Yet the details of these many triumphs over unforeseen ob- 
stacles deserve more than a passing mention. After deter- 
mining that the old methods of delivery were entirely incom- 
patible with this idea of serving milk direct to consumers, so as 
to prevent the many ways of tampering with it, so well known 
to all milkmen, and after adopting his original idea of bottling 
his milk, warm from the cow, one of the first difficulties that 
presented itself was the cleaning of the bottles. This was 
overcome by utilizing his steam power, used in cooking his 
feed, to run a system of fast-revolving brushes, whereby each 
bottle is put through a boiling solution of sal soda and soap, 
then rinsed in boiling hot water, after which they are placed 
in the sun to dry. 

The filling of the bottles was another obstacle met by Mr. 

Ewell by an invention whereby 16 bottles are filled at a time, 

and this going on during the whole time of milking. By the 

time the milking is done the entire product of ten thousand

EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY furnishes the purest and best milk in.the world. 



62 

pounds of milk, or five thousand quart bottles, are all filled and 
sealed, and put away in the cold storage chamber in boxes of 
one dozen each, ready for the heavy teams to bring them into 
town. 

Not the least of the difficulties of producing such an immense 
quantity of milk is the procuring and having on hand the feed 
for seven hundred and fifty cows, for, as before stated, while 
the cows are up to their knees in rich grass, they are fed daily 
seven and one-half tons of other food, such as has been hereto- 
fore mentioned viz.: Wheat, peas, beans, Egyptian corn, 
broom corn seed, middlings, corn and bran in combination, 
varying according to the season and cooked to the consistency 
of mush, amounting to about four tons. In addition there is 
fed daily three and one-half tons of burr clover hay, and from 
two to three tons of squash, fed green, when it can be had. 

This will give the reader some idea of what it is to run a 
large dairy, and yet Mr. Bwell considers his business but in its 
infancy.

ment of the Pacific Bank, the oldest incorporated bank in San

Ball of the Bottles. 



BY AUN*T FANNY ANN. 

It was New Year's night, and all the house was wrapped in 
slumber. The beautiful young ladies of the family, after the 
festivities of the day, were dreaming the pleasures all over 
again, and enjoying them with even greater zest. The fire,, 
too, had settled down to a quiet nap, with just a few red coals 
glowing to keep itself warm. The cat on the hearth had 
ceased her purring, and gave forth a little snore, now and then. 
The sweet flowers that decorated the elegant rooms, had 
drooped their lovely heads, and they too slept. 

But strange to say, on the side board, which had been trans- 
ferred to the back parlor, all was bustle and merriment. 

" Now," spoke up a little fat jug of Curaco, " we are ready, 
but there are so many late why must some bottles, like 
humans, be always late ! " 

" Now, Mrs. Curaco," spoke up Mr. Whiskey, a little thick- 
ly, " you can't shay that of me. I've been here all day and 
and night, too." 

"Yes, you and Mr. Gin are very faithful. As for that, Mr. 
Brandy, too. You stick closer than a brother, if once one is 
at all friendly with you." 

" O, yesh, yesh! we don't forsake a friend, specially if he's 
got the cash," grinned Mr. Whiskey. 

"But there's little Miss Ketchup, the pert little thing, and 
Miss Pepper Sauce these two think they are the world, and 
try and snub me sometimes, and call me "fat," but when I 
shine in a beautiful bright flame on a big plum pudding, I can 
see they nearly faint with envy, specially when somebody si 
making wry faces, because of too much of their company," 
and Mrs. Curaco smoothed out her seal-brown dress, and 
tittered. 

"Yes," Said Mr. Brandy, in a deep voice, that seemed to 
come from the bottom of his boots, ' ' this envy is a dreadful 
thing, the inferior qualities, ' ' casting a sidelong look at Mr. 
Whisky, who luckily did not notice it, or the party might, 
have been broken up before it had begun "are constantly 
envying and aping we of the tipper ten, ' ' and he swelled his 
portly person out to the fullest extent. ' ' But here comes Miss 
Vinegar How do you do, happy New Year, and may you, 
have many of them," and he almost embraced her in his warm 
effusion of good wishes, for it was a well-known fact in bottle 
society that fat Mr. Brandy was a little ' ' struck ' ' on slim Miss 
Vinegar. 

Soon the bottles began to come in two's and three's and

four's, till the side-board was full and crowded. And Mrs. 
Curaco, who had taken upon herself to be mistress of cere- 
monies, with Mr. Whiskey as assistant Mr. Brandy being 
rather too fat and heavy and between us, this was why he 
was angry and sarcastic moved to adjourn to the dining table 
which was an unusually large one. So when they had accom- 
plished the difficult feat of removal, with only a few accidents, 
especially to Mr. Whiskey, who being a little 4 ' oft, ' ' came 
near breaking a leg, so was artistically lame for the rest of the 
night, the dance began. And such laughing and shouting you 
never heard, when suddenly the bell rang loudly, and Miss 
* ' Bottled Milk ' ' was announced, and as she entered with her 
stately tread, and her beautiful shining white dress, all eyes 
were turned towards her in admiration. For a while the dance 
was completely stopped, as every male present wanted her for 
a partner, and as she couldn't be in two places at once, a waltz 
had to be started, and she took a turn around the table with 
each of her admirers, till the poor thing was nearly exhausted, 
and of course she was hated with a deadly hate, and fearfully 
scandalized the rest of the night by all the lady bottles present. 
-So much one has to pay for being the " Belle of the Ball." 
After awhile the dancing became general again, the males pre- 
sent seeing the impossibility of all having Miss Bottled Milk 
for a partner, choose lesser lights, but still quite aristocratic, 
for there was Miss Salad Dressing in her pale yellow robe, 
and Miss Tomato Catsup in red, and Miss Mustard in gold, 
and Miss Ceyenne Pepper in terra cotta. All Mr. Ward McAl- 
listers "Four Hundred" were there, including Mr. Black Pep- 
per; and all the varieties of Wines from France, Italy, Spain, 
Portugal and from our own Golden California. 

When they were tired of dancing, refreshments were served 
the remains of the family's feast of a few hours before and 
then around the warmth of the hanging lamp, whose extin- 
guishment had been forgotten, the good old English custom of 
telling anecdotes and stories, was indulged in. 

Mr. Whisky, soon grew red then black in the face, with 
anger, at all the evil, crime and misery laid at his door, and he 
spoke up saucily. 

''Well there's one thing I can do that none of you can, I 
can make a man feel like a millionaire, if he has a couple of 
drinks of me, and a dime in his pocket for a cigar. ' ' 

"Yes, and then ?" spoke up sober Mr. Black Pepper, 

who was rather a parson in his dress and speech. But Mr. 
Whisky was silent, ^mowing that the end of his votaries, was 
.generally the gutter.

of me. I do good to the sick, as well as to the well," and no 
bottle said nay. 

But the fancy sauces were voted as of little account, except 
as relishes, but Pepper, Salt and Vinegar held their own. All 
the Foreign Mr. Wines listened to the discussion in silence, 
with a high bred simper on their faces. Then Mr. California 
Claret spoke up. 

1 ' There is a distinguished guest present, who with native mod- 
esty, has forbore to parade her claims to distinction and honor 
before this august company, but she and her family are bound to 
work a revolution in the drinking world; the good she has accom- 
plished, is something wonderful; the good she will accomplish, 
is too great to be told. How many babes she has saved from 
death, helping them to grow up into beautiful healthy Califor- 
nia children; how many men she has saved from the gutter, 
and restored to their homes and families, cannot now be told, 
or how she has modestly stood among a lot of vile companions 
on a bar, and shamed them with her purity and goodness her 
very sight quenching the inebriate's fiery thirst she has come 
liere to stay allow me to introduce Miss Bottled Milk, the 
purest and best in the world, from the clean, wholesome, una- 
dulterated article furnished by the EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY 
BOTTLED MILK COMPANY," and such a clapping of hands 
you never heard in fact, some of the bottles are chipped to 
this day, from their enthusiasm. 

Just then such a noise sounded outside. 

" Oh! " cried Mrs. Curaco, " Those low, vulgar beer | bottles, 
are mad at not being invited, and are giving a chiveri; oh, the 
brutes. ' ' But Mr. Whiskey, would not stand having his. poor 
relations abused, tho' he did it himself sometimes, yet it was 
a very different thing to allow others to do so, so he spoke up 
angrily: 

' ' And what are you, you fat old scandal-monger ? you haven't 
a good word for anyone, their music is just as good as you 
make with your gab, gab, gab! " 

"Oh, oh, oh! Mr. Brandy, quick!" cried Mrs. Curaco, and she 
was about to faint in his arms, but he, too, felt himself agrieved 
at the epithet ' fat,' so said, in his deep voice: 

' ' Let me get at him ! ' ' and with one blow from his good right 
hand he landed Mr. Whiskey, smashed and broken, on the floor. 
Then Mr. Gin thought he'd take a hand, and he shared the 
same fate; then Mr. Absinthe smiled a green smile of envy at 
Mr. Brandy's strength, and he lay on the floor, as well. 

Miss Pepper Sauce said: 

" For shame! " for she rather liked the handsome stranger; 
but Miss Bottled Milk looked on serene, knowing it was better

for the dear people, were all their enemies thus destroyed. 
But Miss Vinegar began to cry, as a big chip flew out of Mr. 
Brandy's side, and he soon rolled off the table, with a sigh, 
and joined his victims on the floor. Mrs. Curaco was knocked 
down in the fray, but she was just as happy as ever, knowing 
her fate was to be painted and decorated with ribbons, by Mis- 
tress Port, and to become a parlor ornament. And when the 
simpering foreigners the Wines began to grow excited, and 
to take a hand, Miss Bottled Milk drew her silver hat over 
her eyes, to shut out the disgraceful sight, and the clock struck 
one! 



No other business college on the coast can boast such a long 
term of usefulness as this well-known institution. Its gradu- 
ates are to be found in almost every mercantile establishment 
in the State, and numbers of them have won the highest posi- 
tions in the community. As a training school for business it is 
unequaled, and the general public appreciation of its merits is 
evidenced by the large attendance, which often reaches as high 
as five hundred pupils. This is a practical world, and the de- 
mand is for practical young men and women. A business edu- 
cation one that can be applied so as to enable the student to 
earn a living is worth a great deal of ornamental knowledge, 
and parents are awakening to that fact. The course of in- 
struction at Heald's Business College includes all the ordinary 
commercial branches, book-keeping, penmanship, commercial 
law, shorthand, typewriting, telegraphy and languages. Half 
the stenographers of San Francisco graduated from this institu- 
tion, and the thoroughness of its instruction in every depart- 
ment is generally recognized. It is a school of which San 
Francisco has reason to be proud.

Fruitless Search for trie Mythical 
Co\v ^witri trie Iron Tail. 



[Written for the Chronicle, and published October 6, 1889.] 
There are a great many San Franciscans who dismiss the 
subject of the milk supply from their minds with the brief 
reflection that some person unknown has milked certain cows, 
to them unknown, in some suburban dairy, and has brought a. 
quart of the yield to their doorstep at 5 o'clock in the morning. 
It does not seem to have occurred to these uninquisitive gentry 
that something like a system is required to supply milk twice a 
day, with unfailing regularity, to 300,000 people. 

The milkman is a much-maligned individual. It has been 
cynically affirmed that the milk supply will never run short so 
long as pumps, wells, flumes and hydrants yield a sufficiency 
of water. The caricature of the cow with the iron tail is as old 
as the hills, and in the great cities of Europe, with the notable

exception of Paris, the insinuation as to the connection between 
the milkman and the pump handle is fully justified. We recall 
the old story of the lodging-house keeper and the dairyman. 
" This is very poor milk," remonstrated the indignant land- 
lady, as she gazed at the sky-blue liquid in the milk pitcher. 
"Sorry for it, ma'am," said the dairyman with an evanescent 
look of gravity, "but the cow lay all night in a wet pasture, 
and the rain soaked in through her hide." 

It is fair to say, however, that the people of San Francisco, 
as a rule, get very good milk. The 180 dairies which supply 
the city range from the smallest capacity, represented by a one- 
horse team and an output of twenty gallons per diem, up to 
enterprises of the joint-stock order, which daily send six-horse 
teams to town, the team and milk representing a cash value of 
$2000. 

The dairymen in the small way of business get their milk 
chiefly fram the ranches in Alameda, Marin and San Mateo 
counties by boat and train, but the larger concerns are located 
in the Mission, and especially in the Guadaloupe valley, on the 
San Bruno road, seven miles from the new City Hall. The 
approach to these big milk ranches is by a very pleasant drive 
round an arm of the bay, with stretches of marsh land and 
pleasing expanses of clear-blue water. Of course the water is 
salt, a circumstance which appears to be in some mysterious 
way associated with the success of a dairy-farming enterprise. 
Another object gained by locating a dairy farm on the shores 
of the bay is the advantage offered for transportation of the 
enormous quantities of hay and special feed required for the 
cows. 

A representative of the Chronicle^ who visited one of these 
large dairy ranches, went away a wiser though not a sadder 
man. The first object that met his eye was a big wagon with

six horses harnessed to it, and loaded up for the journey to town. 
It was just 10:30 A. M. and the milk, duly strained and cooled, 
was ready for transportation to the city office, there to be dis- 
tributed to 2,000 consumers the same afternoon. The cows are 
milked twice a day, and as there are 600 of them the sixteen 
milkers are kept busy. To insure dispatch in this particular 
each man milks the same cows every day, for it is a well estab- 
lished fact that an animal always yields more when handled by 
a familiar milker. It is also a fact that, though there are 600 
cows on the ranch and the stalls are exactly alike, every cow 
will walk without hesitation into her own stall when the hour 
of milking arrives. 

The milking for the morning's supply has to be completed by 
9 o'clock of the preceding evening. The wagon is loaded up 
by 10 o'clock and reaches the city delivery office at midnight. 
The delivery teams, about a dozen in number, then commence 
the distribution of the load, and begin to deliver at the doors 
of consumers about i A. M., the process being completed in six 
hours. 

The numerous references to ' ' swill milk ' ' in medical com- 
ments on the milk supply of towns naturally prompted the 
inquiry whether the cows of the great San Bruno dairies 
are fed on "swill," which it may be parenthetically stated, is 
the refuse of distilleries. It is well known to medical men that 
cows fed in this manner soon get into an unhealthy febrile 
condition, and yield poor milk, entirely unsuited for children 
and invalids. For reply to the question, the Chronicle represen- 
tative was shown the special food prepared for the cows. In a 
large shed was placed a boiler containing three tons of feeding 
material, and an adjoining tank containing two tons more, 
cooked by steam. The food consisted of Egyptian corn, wheat, 
beans, peas and bran. The cooked food, which is clean and

sweet enough for human consumption, is run off when cold 
into troughs adjoining the stalls, so arranged that each cow can 
get her share without hinderance. Every pound and a half of 
this food produces a pound of milk. The common notion that 
cows will give all the milk required on grass feed alone is 
rudely dispelled by the statistics of a dairy ranch. Provision 
is, however, made for the cows on this particular ranch to 
obtain a share of grass food. When the Chronicle representa- 
tive visited the place the cows, 600 in number, were turned out 
on a range of 800 acres, and they also received daily four tons- 
of clover. Lastly, the skim milk is added to the cows' feed. 
The healthy appearance of the herd gave abundant evidence of 
the beneficial results of the treatment. 

Said the manager : " Our experience is that the production 
of milk, to be made a commercial success, must be conducted 
on commercial principles; that is to say, by producing on a large 
scale an article of the best quality at a good price. Not a drop 
of water is added to our milk, because a certain standard is re- 
quired by our consumers, which would not pay us to depart 
from. In smaller dairies it will often happen that the milk has 
to be watered to make up for a short supply, for even the daily 
yield of a cow is an uncertain matter. I can point to my record 
books, and merely by glancing at the figures, pick out the hot 
and cold days, for cows are very susceptible of atmospheric 
influences, and when the temperature varies [greatly from 65 
degrees, the yield of milk decreased." 

The herd of 600 made a brave show on the hillside. They 
were of all breeds Devons, Jerseys, Shorthorns, Ayreshires, 
and Denmarks, while a great many crosses were noticed. It is 
found in modern dairy farming that the thoroughbred cow is not 
the best for dairy purposes, but that judicious crossing, with an 
eye single to the yield of milk, gives the best results.

Some of the Obstacles that Have 
to be Overcome. 



WHY DOCTORS RECOMMEND IT. 



Some allusion has heretofore been made in these articles, on 
this subject, yet the attention of the public cannot be too 
earnestly fixed on this important point of their milk supply. 

While claiming to produce a better and richer milk than any 
other dairy that serves milk in this city, the E WELL'S X. L. 
DAIRY BOTTLED MILK CO. do not claim that good, pure 
milk is not served by other dairies. Many times it is not the 
fault of the dairies, but of the men employed to deliver it. 

A weak man (morally) on a very moderate salary is often 
tempted to stop at a saloon, wet, cold, and frequently hungry, 
and withal, a not over-plethoric purse. The temptation to make 
terms with the saloon man is obvious. Result: Several gallons 
of top of can milk is furnished the saloon, and water substi- 
tuted, and the poor victims are the customers that happen to 
come next. This is only one of the incidental risks overcome 
by Mr. Ewell's<system of bottling milk warm from the cow, to 
say nothing of the fact that, by fcis system, every bottle must 
and can be accounted for. . 

Another important item in this manner of delivering milk is

Mountain Cake, No. 1. 

Sift carefully through one pound of sifted flour two heaping teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder, whip to cream half pound of butter, then stir into the butter 
one pound of sugar, the yolks of six eggs and about half of the flour; then add 
one cup of E WELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK and the remainder of 
the flour; lastly the whites of six eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and lemon, vanilla 
or orange extract to flavor; bake in a slow oven. 

Cocoanut Pound Cake. 

One cup of butter, two and two-thirds cups sugar, four cups flour (scant 
cups), four eggs, one cup cocoanut, one cup sweet milk (E WELL'S X. L. 
DAIRY, PUREST AND BEST IN THE WORLD), two teaspoonfuls yeast 
powder. 

Corn Starch Cake. 

Whites of six eggs, one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, two cups of flour, 
one scant cup of corn starch, one cup milk (X. L. ), one-half teaspoonful yeast 
powder. Very nice. 



PIES. 



Pie Crust. 

For good common pie crust, mix thoroughly two teaspoons of baking pow- 
der with one quart of flour, well sifted, dry ; then take half a pound of short- 
ening, more or less, as you may prefer the cooked article more or less short ; 
crust looks nicer when lard is used, but part butter makes a better taste. 
Rub half of the shortening with three- fourths of the flour, add a little salt if 
lard only is used for shortening ; when well mixed, add just sufficent cold 
water to make it roll out easily ; divide the crust into two equal parts, use 
one for the under crust ; flour the rolling board and pin with some of the flour; 
for the upper crust, use the rest of the paste, adding the other half of the 
shortening and the remainder of the flour. Do not warm the shortening to a 
melted state, or the crust will not be flaky. Less shortening will be required 
when baking powder is used than if made without. 

Squash Pie. 

Steam the squash over boiling water until soft ; strain through a colan- 
der ; one pint of squash, one pint E WELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK, three eggs, one cup of sugar, one teaspoonful of ginger, and one of nut- 
meg, a little salt ; bake without top crust. 

Pumpkin Pie, No. 1. 

Pare and grate raw pumpkin ; to one pint of grated pumpkin add one 
quart of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, two cups sugar, one 
teaspoonful of ginger and one of cinnamon, half a teaspoonful of salt, three 
well beaten eggs ; bake in custard pans with an under crust. 

Pumpkin Pie, No. 3. 

Pare nice, ripe pumpkin, slice into small pieces, boil or stew them with 
water enough to prevent burning ; when quite tender rub the pulp through a 
colander ; to one pint, add one pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK, two eggs, one cup sugar and one teaspoonful of nutmeg and ginger.

its cleanliness. Under the old way, every vessel used, /. <?., the 
milk can, the cover, the utensil for receiving it furnished by 
the customer, must necessarily be exposed to the dust, dirt and 
street sweepings, generally, every time milk is transferred from 
the wagon-can to the customer's receptacle in dry weather, to 
say nothing of the drippings from oilcloth coats, etc., during 
the rainy season. All these and many more reasons can be 
mentioned in favor of bottling milk as soon as strained, and im- 
mediately hermetically sealed, not the least being the well- 
known adaptability of milk to absorb odors prevalent about all 
dairies, notwithstanding the utmost care is taken to keep every- 
thing clean. 

Another good feature is the fact that every bottle shows at 
once the cream on top ; if not uniform it would show at once. 
And if you find your milk varies, by this system, you have only 
to insist that your bottle be not opened by the servant until placed 
before you on the table. Do not conclude at once that your 
milk is not as heretofore, before insisting on this. Good rich 
milk is frequently a great temptation to servants, who appre- 
ciate it quite as much as yourselves. It is risky to tamper with 
EWEU/S BOTTLED MILK, on the part of servants, if the 
master or mistress are only ordinarily careful. 

A story told the writer by one of San Francisco's most suc- 
cessful retail merchants will illustrate this, and is as follows : 

Being put by his physician upon a milk diet for a disordered 
stomach, and having heard a great deal about EWELL'S BOT- 
TLED MILK, he concluded to try it, using altogether, himself 
and family, four quarts per day, his personal allowance being 
three bottles. Very much to his disgust, one day he found his 
milk very different from what it had been, and, as usual in such 
cases, began abusing his milk man with such expressions as

Sweet Potato Vie. 4 

Boil or bake sufficient sweet potatoes to make a pint of the pulp when 
rubbed through a colander ; add a pint of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOT- 
TLED MJLK, a small cup of sugar, a little salt, the yolks of two eggs, a tea- 
spoonful of lemon ; bake in a shallow pan lined with a rich crust. When done, 
beat the whites of the eggs with powdered sugar for the top, and brown it in 
the oven. 

Rice Pie. 

To a quart of boiling water, add a teacupful of rice, boil until very soft * 
remove it from the fire and add a quart of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK, a teaspoonful of salt, five beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of nutmeg extract; 
sugar to taste, and bake in deep pie-plates with an under crust and rim of 
pastry. 

Cocoanut Pie. 

For a pie put a cnp of grated cocoanut to soak over night, if it is dessi- 
cated ; place in a coffeecup and fill it with EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOT- 
TLED MILK. When ready to bake, take two teaspoonfuls of flour, mix it 
with a cup of EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK ; place on the stove 
in a tin pail placed in a kettle of boiling water ; stir it until it thickens ; add a

" ' Never knew a man to keep up his standard after making a 
success," "Just as I thought it would be; can't depend on any 
t>ne!" And, waxing warmer as he reflected upon the perfidy of 
man, and particularly of milk men, he finally ordered his milk 
stopped, and told his wife never to take any more of that 
EWELL'S MILK. The terrific outburst finally became so 
warm that his much more level-headed wife appealed to the 
servant as to the cause of such deterioration of the milk, who, 
"with the utmost sangfroid, stated that, having an urgent neces- 
sity for some cream to use in some of her culinary concoctions, 
she had taken the cream from each and every bottle and simply 
filled them up with what was left, without reporting the matter 
to her mistress. It is needless to say the order to discontinue 
taking EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK was im- 
mediately countermanded, and the great merchant, meeting 
the writer, was so overjoyed at finding that there was at least 
one honest man, opened out upon the scribe about thusly: 
H 'Say, you have something to do with that man Ewell, have 
you not?" "Yes," replied the knight of the lead pencil, 
1 ' what of it ? " " Well, I want you to tell Ewell when you see 
liim that I think he furnishes the best milk in the world;" and, 
getting the cool reply, ''Well, Mr. Ewell knows that; why 
should I tell him that ? ' ' This so astonished the man full of 
EWELL'S BOTTLED MILK that he almost fainted, and com- 
ing down to business told the story as given above, and hence- 
forth will no doubt be a walking advertisement of EWELL'S 
X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK, the noted improvement in 
his looks being enough to attract the attention of all his friends, 
whose name is legion. 

Another case showing the advantage of a milk diet when it 
is indeed milk, is that of a prominent boot and shoe dealer on 
Market street, whose friends about two years ago did not ex-

pect him to live. Meeting the writer one day recently, the noted 
improvement in his looks called forth the jocular remark, 
' ' Well, I am beginning to think you will pass for life insur- 
ance; hadn't you better let me put in an application for ten 
thousand ? " Very much to our surprise his reply was: " That 
is just what I did last week." This astounding piece of in- 
formation so upset the writer, who has a friend in the life insur- 
ance business, and is accustomed to throw his influence that 
way, that he felt it incumbent to ask what had occasioned so 
notable an improvement. ' ' My doctor put me on a milk diet 
and ordered me to take EWELL' S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK. As my case was almost hopeless I complied, and for 
many months lived almost wholly upon milk, using as much at 
times as four quarts per day, but now I am only using two 
bottles, and weigh 165 pounds. Before going upon the milk 
diet I was reduced to less than 100 pounds, and if Mr. Ewell 
wants any reference as to the quality of his milk he has only to 
call upon me. I think the milk saved my life." 

Thus it will be seen there is as much of philanthrophy as 
profit in producing milk upon which infants, invalids and well 
people thrive, the only disappointment being the difficulty of 
overcoming dishonest competition. If the few honest dealers 
that supply only about one-half of the milk used in this 
city would combine, and admit none into their association but 
those who furnish pure milk, and charge as Mr. Ewell does, 
ten cents per quart for it, and no less, they might control the 
better portion of the family trade and leave the cheap restaur- 
ant part of it to vendors who can produce only cheap milk. The 
unparalleled success of the EWELL X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED 
MILK CO. shows that people are willing to pay a fair price for 
a good article.

THK TRIALS OF THE BUSINESS. 

Very few of our citizens have any idea of the enormous diffi- 
culties that have to be overcome by the milkmen of this city 
who really have dairies. We do not include the so-called 
dairies who keep their cows in large barns and feed them 
entirely on brewery slop, but, of course, they being in the city, 
have the use of good roads. But the milkmen who have 
large ranches of hundreds of acres, cannot, of course, find pas- 
tures for their cows on this peninsula, but have to go down 
into San Mateo county. The past winter has been a hard 
one on them. Through the blunders of - the Street Depart- 
ment, and the indifference of the contractors for the Omnibus 
railroad extension, the old San Bruno road has been rendered 
impassable at times, and the strange fact has been brought 
to the attention of the public that we have not, by land, a 
decent outlet for San Francisco, or a single road that an 
ordinary load can be hauled over by the best of horses. 

We unhesitatingly assert that there is not in the whole 
United States another city of its size that is so completely 
isolated in winter, in bad weather, as this city. It is a disgrace 
to the municipality that there is not a single good all-through- 
the-year road or drive leading out of this city. 

During the past winter for months the EWELL'S X. L. 
DAIRY have been obliged to double the cost of hauling their 
product on account of the deplorable condition of the San 
Bruno road, and at one time had actually to abandon it. The 
product of one milking that should have been brought into 
their depot at Twenty-first and Folsom Streets by a single six- 
horse team was started one night in two six-horse wagons, one 
four-horse and one two-horse ; at one point on the road one of 
the six-horse wagons actually sunk so deep in the road that it

Mr. Kwell, who realizes how much inconvenience results 
from his customers not getting their milk at the accustomed 
time, chartered a steamer, and for many days brought his milk

Such enterprise only illustrates why Mr. KwelJ. succeeded in

where it ministers to our necessities, as in so important a thing-

CONTRASTS. 



Why Swell's X. L. Milk Must be a 
Superior Article. 



This book, in previous pages, has endeavored to demonstrate 
the superior advantages of E WELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOT- 
TLED MILK over milk deposited, transported and delivered 
in metal receptacles, and the greater nutrition that is, and 
must necessarily be, contained in a pure article, kept free from 
occuous contact, and which is from animals whose healthy 
condition and careful and proper nutrition are the prime consid- 
erations in the production of the article. All this goes without 
saying to the intelligent mind ; and, for the avoidance of repeti- 
tion, we will only here repeat the axiom, which is every day 
demonstrated, that "the best is the cheapest." The main 
object of this particular chapter is to draw 

THE CONTRASTS 

Between a pure, honest, carefully and physiologically produced 
article with that of the product of shiftlessness and ignorance. 
It is not worth while to charge' adulterations, because that such 
are freely practiced by unscrupulous persons is as well known 
to the reading community if not to every consumer as the 
fact that men will stretch their consciences and their goods 
just the least leetle bit in the struggle for existence and the pur- 
suit of the almighty dollar. Numberless newspaper sensations 
and volumes of scientific scintillations have been devoted to 
" swill" milk. Happily, "swill" milk is a rarity in San 
Francisco, but it exists all the same ; and, while but few milch

cows are fed on distillery swill as* strange to say, California, 
while a great grain-producing State, contains but few distli- 
leries and imports the major portion of the spirits consumed in 
her borders there is, in many instances, in the vicinity of San 
Francisco a dairy feeding which is as injurious to the cow, and, 
consequently, as detrimental to the purity of the milk, as if the 
animals were fevered on a diet of distillery swill. Now, as to 
the contrast between metal and glass, admitting, for the mo- 
ment, that all milk sold in San Francisco is from cows equally 
fed and cared for [which is not the case], let us reason a little 
on the matter. In the first place, the pores of metal are more 
sensitive to the absorption of filth than are those of glass, and 
are less easily cleansed. There is no body liquid or solid 
which in the nature of its constituents is more sensitive to the 
absorption of atmospheric, metallic, animal or vegetable poison- 
ous particles than milk. If these particles permeate the pores 
of the vessel in which the milk is contained, a poisonous residue 
remains, which in the case of some so-called dairies is never 
removed by cleaning, but remains as a typhoidic condition in 
the pores of the metal till the defunct can finds its way to its 
Potter's Field in the junk shop. That 

' ' GOOD FOOD 

Makes good blood," and that the blood is the life, are two ex- 
pressions that we cannot forbear quoting in this connection; 
although we have promised to endeavor to avoid repetition as 
to the hygienic features of the production of EWELL/S X. L. 
DAIRY BOTTLED MILK ; but, having, either purposely 
or inadvertently, been led into this lapse, we will now discuss 
this question from a chemical standpoint. This we propose to 
do in a homely way, as freely as possible from technical terms 
or scientific phrases. One of the active principles of milk is 
lactic acid. All acids, whether animal, vegetable or mineral,

have a reactive effect on the ignoble metals, and tin and iron 
come in this category. This action is the freeing of mineral 
salts, and every metallic salt is a poison. Many of these salts 
are used in medicine, however, but only in infinitesimal quan- 
tities under the prescription of a physician. Lactic acid is as 
liable to produce these salts as is sulphuric, nitric or any of the 
stronger acids of chemistry or commerce. No such effect can 
come from glass, as that material is impervious to the action of 
acids and contains no poisonous qualities to be freed, to enter 
into the composition of the contents of the containing vessel. 
Were metals as non-sensitive to disintegration by acids as is glass 
the chemical works would not go to the expense and trouble of 
confining acids in the clumsy and costly carboy, but would en- 
close them in neat and handy metal packages. Agitation of acid 
against metal is certain to free the metallic salts, and the rapid 
transportation necessary in the delivery of the milk from 
the dairy to the consumer necessarily causes agitation, 
and also a fermentation, which causes are sure solvents of 
the metallic salts in the metal of which the containing 
vessel is composed. If our milkmen would substitute gold 
or silver milk cans for tin-plated iron, this chemical action 
would not take place, for the nobler metals do not respond to 
'the action of acids. As all dairymen cannot be Solomons, 
Neros, Caligulas, Mammons, Croesuses, Vanderbilts, Jay 
Goulds, Railroad Princes or Bonanza Kings, the consumer can 
not expect to have his milk carried to him in gold or silver 
cans ; and, therefore, the next best thing is glass, which is in- 
ocuous and easily and readily cleaned. Even were glass sub- 
ject to the chemical action of lactic acid as is metal, even then 
EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK would be safer 
than the milk carried in cans ; for, the bottles being filled to 
the brim and hermetically sealed, there is no chance for agita-

tion or "churning" in carriage, and hence no possibility of 
fermentation. 

LACTIC ACID, 

As chemically known, is sugar in solution induced by albu- 
minous ferments, exposed in said solution to the atmosphere, 
producing 'an element known as diastase. This is a strong 
absorbent, as anybody can demonstrate by placing an open 
vessel containing milk in a closed receptacle, as an ice chest or 
cupboard where other food articles are contained, and it will be 
found that the milk has absorbed the odors of the other articles 
thus brought in contact ; or, if said milk be set in the open air, 
it will be found to readily absorb floating atmospheric particles 
of whatever nature. Now, if we place milk in glass and her- 
metically seal the orifice of the vessel, which has a cap so 
handily arranged that you can draw just such quantity as is 
required for use at the time being, and then re-seal the 
bottle, it must be apparent that the fluid so protected must be 
free from contamination from the outer atmosphere, as well as 
protected from the opportunity of the absorption of sur- 
rounding elements, animal, vegetable or otherwise ; that is to 
say, if this milk is put in the same cupboard with Limburger 
cheese it will not rob the cheese of its perfume, and if onions 
happen to be on the same shelf in the closet the milk in the 
bottle will not absorb the scent of the onion. 

Lactic acid in milk fresh from the cow and uncontaminated 
by atmospheric or metallic chemical influences, is not only 
nutriment, but medicine. Set this acid free by taking it up 
with bi-carbonate of soda, the casein separated therefrom fer- 
ments, and by the addition of soda, the sugar of milk contained 
becomes butyric acid. The effect of this acid on iron is to pro- 
duce the lactate of iron, which causes oxidization of the metal. 
Now all these chemical products from the action of lactic acid

on metal are good in their places in the drug stores ; but we 
don't want them in our milk which we use ourselves or feed to 
our tender infants. The writer once heard Brigham Young 
preach a sermon on butter. . It was at the inception of the Gen- 
tile migration through Utah to Montana, when the Mormons 
found ready cash customers for their farm products, which was 
something new to them, as before that all their business trans- 
actions were carried on by what they called ' 'Trade, ' ' or, in other 
words, swapping. Said Brigham : 

' ' I want to say a few words to the sisters before we sing the 
doxology. These sons of Belial, these Gentiles who are pass- 
ing through Zion in search of Mammon, complain that they 
find hairs in the butter they buy from the Saints. Now, 
brethren and sisters, we all know that hair is a good thing in 
its place, but nobody wants it in his butter. ' ' 

So with metallic salts and other poisons that may be useful 
in medicine ; they are good enough in their place, but we don't 
want them in our milk. 

One of the diseases for which butyric acid is prescribed by 
physicians is chlorosis. One of the attendants of this com- 
plaint is an abnormal and morbid craving for chalk, which is 
eaten with avidity. Victims of this ailment need not expect to 
find relief in this particular in EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY MILK ; 
but, for purity and nutritive qualities, all invalids will find that 
this milk is true to name and cannot be XL/d. 

A RESUME. 

Mr. Ewell does not for a moment intend to claim or convey 
that PURE MII,K in properly cleansed tin vessels is poisonous or 
injurious to health, because pure milk is life and health-giving. 
But what he does claim is the superiority of glass over metal 
as the containing vessel, on the score that under the metal 
system there is always a liability of the absorption of impurities 
by contact, atmospheric or otherwise, and a possibility of inte- 
gration into the milk, by agitation, of the poisonous salts con-

tained in the enclosing metal. Such contingencies are abso- 
lutely impossible under the glass system as pursued by Mr. 
Bwell. 

During the summer season one can scarcely pick up a news- 
paper without reading accounts of wholesale poisoning by ice 
cream. Ice cream is delicious and refreshing in heated times, 
and, when properly prepared from pure ingredients, is no more 
injurious than is a beefsteak to a healthy and hungry man in 
mid-winter. The poisons generated in ice cream may be, and 
are, due to various causes, as follows: A dirty freezer, with 
the decomposed particles of former freezings permeating the 
pores, the metalic salts contained in milk held in cans and trans- 
ported to the picnic or church social through the agitation of 
transportation, or the febrile or otherwise unhealthy condition 
of the milk or cream itself. Such conditions are not only im- 
probable, but next to impossible, in ice cream made from pure 
milk, protected from the influences of milk thus exposed and 
enclosed and conveyed in cans; and, for making ice cream; there 
as richness and less danger in EWEU-/S X. L,. MILK than in 
the alleged cream of the ordinary dairy; because, it being a pure 

article, and protected against the unadventitious conditions 



that attend milk by the can system, the danger of the disinte- 
gration of the salts of the metal of which the freezer is con- 
tained is reduced to a minimum, and, if the freezer has been prop- 
erly scoured, the presence of metalic salts is so infinitesmal that 
the amount contained in a freezerfull of ice cream couldn't dis- 
turb the stomach of a humming bird.

POWDERED MILK. 



Invention of a S^viss Savant Wnicht 
Reverses Known. Natural 



The idea of reducing cow's milk to a dry powder, says the 
American Dairyman, and shipping it in this condition all over 
the world, seems to have first originated with Dr. Krueger, 
a Swiss savant, and under his management a company was 
organized to make milk powder in Switzerland. 

It is claimed that milk in this form is much better than 
canned or condensed milk for one reason it has no sugar in 
it. It is well known that condensed milk cannot be used in 
many departments of cooking on account of this sugar, and this 
also makes it objectionable for use with very young children, 
not that sugar itself is injurious to children, for it is always put 
into their milk, we believe, but it is better that this sugar be 
put in fresh at the time of preparing milk for the child. 

How far this powdered milk will answer these objects re- 
mains to be seen. One thing is certain, the powder would be 
much better for transportation and more handy to have in the 
house than either plain or condensed milk, provided it is a 
success. 

It looks somewhat dubious as a complete substitute for plain; 
milk, not only on account of necessary expense, but we do not 
find any kind of food capable of being thoroughly dried and 
afterward made over with water so as to closely resemble the 
original article, and we never expect to see it done with cow's 
milk. 

Nature has a way of mingling these things that thus far maa 
has not been able to closely imitate. 

The above from a recent issue of the Call shows how utterly 
hopeless is the idea of ever producing any substitute for pure 
rich cow's milk, such as is produced by E WELL'S X. L. 
DAIRY BOTTLED MILK CO., bottled warm from the cow.

FEED VS. BREED. 



It is a singular fact that notwithstanding Mr. Ewell's expe- 
rience years ago taught him that feed, and the manner of pre- 
paring it, was of more importance than fancy breeds of cattle, 
the following from the Breeder and Sportsman of this city is the 
first acknowledgment of this important point we have noticed 
by any prominent authority : 

' ' In breeding dairy stock, individual merit and the posses- 
sion of desirable qualities are more to be considered than the 
breed, which is valuable only as it indicates the probable 
possession of these qualities, with the power to transmit them. 
The breed or the individual animal that possesses the most de- 
sirable points and gives the best return, in milk, beef or work, 
is the one to be desired. In breeding for beef, not only quan- 
tity but quality should be considered. If for work, both weight 
and endurance, coupled with activity, should be aimed at. 
The dairy animal should be bred more for quality than lor 
quantity, more for value of the returns at the pail than for size . 
Too many Holsteins have been reared because they were Hoi- 
steins, and too many Jerseys because they were Jerseys, and so 
on. The small animal with the rich mess of milk needs to be 
bred up and have the flow increased. The large animal with 
the large yield of only fairly good milk needs to be bred for the 
improvement of the quality of the milk. This can be done by 
selecting and breeding from the animals giving the richest 
milk. We want more lean meat in our hogs, which means 
more nitrogenous food and exercise. For mutton sheep we 
want the large carcass of lean and fat well mixed and tender, 
and for wool we want not only weight but fine and even fibre, 
strong and elastic. In short, we must always have a purpose 
in view in breeding, and subordinate everything else to that 
purpose. 

' ' It will generally be observed that big feed and big yield go 
together. There is nothing unphilosophical about this. So

long as the yield increases with increase of feed, it pays, no 
matter how much may be fed, provided the cow's system will 
stand it and convert the extra feed into milk and butter. It 
becomes thus far a mere question of converting raw material 
into manufactured product. A cow cannot make something 
out of nothing, and the point to be determined is only how 
much may be fed with a paying profit. In some of the re- 
markable tests it would not be strange if the feed should be 
pushed beyond the point of profit, nor if the cow should be in- 
jured by forcing her beyond her normal capacity. The Hoi- 
stein- Friesian Register calls attention to the feed of the Jersey 
cow Cromwell Maid, when from July 2ist to July 27, 1887, she 
averaged 19^ quarts of milk per day, which made 29 pounds 
and 1 2 ounces of butter. Her daily grain feed was 6 quarts of 
corn meal, 7 quarts oat meal, 2 quarts of pea meal, i quart of 
oil meal and 6 quarts of middlings. This is figured out to be 
34.87 pounds of grain feed daily, which is certainly very high 
for a goo-pound cow. But how could she be expected to pro- 
duce such a prodigious result without it ? Comparison is made 
with the feed of the Holstein-Friesian cow De Kol 2d, which 
made 33 pounds and 6 ounces of butter in 7 days. The daily 
ration was 18 pounds of hominy chop, 7}^ pounds of wheat 
bran and 3^ pounds of cotton seed meal a total of 29 pounds 
of grain. She weighed 1500 pounds, and averaged a pound of 
butter for 6^> ounces of grain feed, while the Jersey consumed 
S 7-32 ounces of grain feed for a pound of butter. Thus it ap- 
pears that a pound of Jersey butter costs more grain feed than 
a pound of Holstein-Friesian butter, the smaller animal eating 
the more. We do not question the fairness of this statement, 
as far as it goes ; but unfortunately there is a big omission. 
Only the grain feed is given. How much grass, hay, or other 
food did each animal consume ? With this omission, the com- 
parison is incomplete. ' ' 

And yet no large dealers have so far adopted his system of 
cooking all his grains. As has been mentioned in former arti- 
cles in this book, cooking feed for cows enables him to use a 
greater variety of food than can be fed by simply grinding and 
feeding it moistened. For instance, he uses corn, wheat,

Candy. 



Molasses Candy. 

Take one pint of granulated sugar, one pint of New Orleans molasses; 
place over a slow fire and boil, stirring all the time to prevent burning; when 
nearly done, add butter the size of an egg; when a little dropped in cold water 
becomes hard and snaps, it is sufficiently boiled; take from the fire, add one 
saltspooii of soda, rubbed fine, stir quickly to mix, and pour on large buttered 
platters to cool; let it run down flat; as it cools keep turning in the outer edges 
toward the center, so that the whole may cool evenly; when cool enough to 
handle without burning the hands, pull it over a hook or in the hands, as fast 
as possible; the more the candy is worked the lighter it will be. 

Molasses Candy. 

One cup of New Orleans molasses, two cups of sugar, one tablespoonful of 
vinegar, a little butter; boil until brittle if dropped in cold water; pour on but- 
tered platters to cool, and pull. 

Molasses Candy Taffy. 

Put a pint of New Orleans molasses in a stew pan over a slow fire to boil; 
stir it to prevent its boiling over; take it off when it has boiled half an hour, 
try it by taking some in a saucer; when cold, if it is brittle it is done; flavor 
with lemon, sassafras or vanilla and pour it quarter of an inch deep in buttered 
pans; shelled peanuts or almonds may be stirred into it, enough to make thick, 
or but few. 

Scotch Butter. 

One pound of brown sugar, one teacupful of water, one -half cup butter, half 
teaspooiiful essence of lemon; put the sugar and water into a saucepan and beat 
the butter to a cream; when the sugar has dissolved, add the butter and keep 
stirring the mixture over the fire until it sets when a little is poured into cold 
water; just before the Scotch is done add the essence of lemon; pour it over a 
buttered tin; when cool, break it in regular pieces; ginger can be used in place 
of vanilla. 

Yankee Cream. 

Six ounces of loaf sugar, one ounce of soaked isinglass and one pint of 
EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK put in a saucepan; boil slowly and 
stir all the time until the isinglass is dissolved; strain the mixture, and when a. 
little cool mix it with a coffee-cup of cream; beat thoroughly until it thickens; 
pour into a mould and put away to cool.

Egyptian corn, bran, peas, beans, broom corn seed and mid- 
dlings, in various combinations, cooked to the consistency of 
mush, many of the most valuable of which cannot be used by 
simply grinding, as cows will not eat it raw, thus enabling 
him to feed his cows a greater variety ; and they do not be- 
come tired of having the same food too often. 

Another clipping from the same valuable journal gives some 
information on the milk question in Boston, giving analyses of 
milk from all the best dairies, in none of which do their tests 
come anywhere near the grade of the milk regularly served by 
the EWELL'S X. L. DAIRY BOTTLED MILK COMPANY 
of this city to their patrons, as has been shown by the analysis 
of two of the most prominent chemists in this city, from milk 
taken at random from their delivery wagons on the street, 
with no thought of submitting it for a test. 

" The Boston people or, rather, milk dealers appear to be 
considerably waked up on the milk question. They are trying 
to get at some scale whereby milk may be bought and sold 
without doing injustice to any one. Naturally their first drive 
is at the amount of solids contained in the average milk of the 
different heards. Analyses of 391 samples showed 19 below n 
per cent, of solids, 121 between n and 12, 192 between 12 and 
13, 51 between 13 and 14, and 8 above 14 per cent of solids. 
Car No. i contained 88 samples averaging 12^ ; car No. 2 con- 
tained 1 1 samples averaging a little over 1 2 ; car No. 3 con- 
tained 52 samples averaging 12 ; car No. 4 contained 71 sam- 
ples averaging 12, and car No. 5 contained 112 samples 
averaging 12^ per cent, of solids. The low average is 
attributed to the wet weather and the extra succulency of the 
feed. The milk is said to be deficient in sugar and fat. The 
lack of sugar in sweet corn, which has been noticed by many, 
is given as evidence of the truthfulness of this conclusion: The 
quantity of milk has been increased, but the quality lowered. 
The increase has been mainly in the element of water. It 
causes lower figures, but the extra amount makes up for this 
loss in price and keeps the dairyman's receipts at about a fair

average. Now all this analysis of milk and development of 
facts is interesting and confirmatory of the popular opinion 
about the effect of excessive moisture on quality, but what 
does it settle as far as the equity of the cause is concerned ? 
The analyses shows only the condition at the time when the 
samples were taken, but do not touch the future at all. There 
is a constant daily variation in quality which must daily be 
ascertained in order to do justice to all concerned. Have the 
Boston men discovered any method, whereby they can test the 
milk of any dairy on every car that reaches them ? If not, they 
are still beating the air. The test for solids is as simple and just 
as any, as it is made by simple evaporation. Can this be done 
every day ? And then can average samples of every herd be 
always taken ? This taking of samples is a nice thing to do. 
One or two cans may not truly represent the rest, and the sam- 
ple taken from a single can may not truly represent the con- 
tents of the whole can. The obstacles in the way of reaching 
perfect justice are many." 



On page 144 will be found the advertisement of Messrs. 
James Duffy & Co., in which a point is made that deserves the 
serious consideration of our well-to-do people. There is prob- 
ably no other city in the world where white walls predominate 
as in this city, and a more incongruous conglomeration than 
handsome furniture, an elegant carpet, and white walls, can- 
not be imagined. Besides wall paper in endless variety, they 
offer a fine assortment of other decorations to finish off a room, 
artistically, too numerous to mention. 

On page 148 is the advertisement of the M. I. S. T. Com- 
pany, the most prominent feature of which is the honest manner 
in which they advertise the merits of their remedy. You are 
not referred to people living in the State of Maine or in Pata- 
gonia, as is too often the case, but the names of well-known 
citizens of this city are given, with their address, located in 
various parts of the city, convenient for any one to refer to.

a stewpan until it becomes quite clear ; add the juice of one lemon and a little 
white wine. *

I arn broken down and discouraged, and

This remark we often hear from both men and 
women that are positively in that condition 
that life is no longer to them a pleasure, but 
instead a continual bore. THE GREAT SI- 
ERRA KIDNEY AND LITER CURE is es- 
pecially adapted for just such cases. It acts 
gently on the bowels, purifies the blood with- 
out unsightly blotches, renovates the kidneys 
and liver, the great organs of existence that 
must be kept clear. By thus doing its work 
it brings the nervous system into a healthy 
condition, producing sound and refreshing 
sleep. For all female complaints, leucorrhea, 
suppressed menses, no matter from what 
cause, attended by severe pain, and all other 
complaints so common among women, it im- 
mediatel} 7 relieves and effects a permanent 
cure. Put aside all prejudice and give this 
most wonderful and best of all remedies a 
trial. Warranted purely vegetable. Delight- 
ful to the taste. For sale by all druggists.

The above cut of the "Blind Goddess of Justice " is the best 
exemplification of the policy pursued by the EWELL X. L- 
DAIRY BOTTLED MILK CO. towards their customers 
that could be found, as there is positively no possibility of one 
getting any better milk than another. Their policy of bottling 
milk warm from the cow precludes the possibility of any selec- 
tion. As the milk is brought in from each string of milkers 
every few minutes, put through the same strainer, and the 
bottling process constantly going on, it is evident that there 
can be no choice, every bottle containing the average of their 
daily product. Their employees are often importuned to "be 
sure and serve us your best -milk. ' ' By this system there is abso- 
lutely no such thing as best, all are served exactly alike and at 
the same price. The family taking ten quarts per day pays ten 
cents per quart for each and every quart bottle, and has no 
preference over the family taking a single quart bottle per day. 
A short trial will convince anyone that their milk is uniform in 
quality and cannot possibly vary. When you get the E WELL'S 
X. L. BOTTLED MILK, you get the best that can possibly 
be produced. 

Occasionally a new patron of the E WELL'S X. L- DAIRY 
BOTTLED MILK CO. complain that their milk has a peculiar 
taste. This is because they are not used to milk so thick, and 
by using a sufficient quantity of water they will find the taste 
such as they have been accustomed to.
