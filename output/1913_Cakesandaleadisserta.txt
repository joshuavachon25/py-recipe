JOHN CORLETT 

flLANDEST OF HOSTS, BEST OF TRENCHERMIJI 

I DEDICATE 

(without any SORT OF PERMISSION) 

THIS BOOK 



PREFACE 

A LONG time ago, an estimable lady fell at the 
feet of an habitual publisher, and prayed unto 
him : — 

" Give, oh ! give me the subject of a book for 
which the world has a need, and I will write it 
for you." 

" Are you an author, madam ? " asked the 
publisher, motioning his visitor to a seat. 

" No, sir," was the proud reply, " I am a poet." 

" Ah ! " said the great man. " I am afraid 
there is no immediate worldly need of a poet. If 
you could only write a good cookery book, now ! " 

The story goes on to relate how the poetess, 
not rebuffed in the least, started on the requisite 
culinary work, directly she got home ; pawned 
her jewels to purchase postage stamps, and wrote 
far and wide for recipes, which in course of time 
she obtained, by the hundredweight. Other 
recipes she " conveyed " from ancient works oi 
gastronomy, and in a year or two the magnum opu 
was given to the world ; the lady's share in the 



X CAKES AND ALE 

profits giving her "adequate provision for the 
remainder of her life." We are not told, but it 
is presumable, that the publisher received a little 
adequate provision too. 

History occasionally repeats itself; and the 
history of the present v^ork begins in very much 
the same vv^ay. Whether it vv^ill finish in an 
equally satisfactory manner is problematical. I do 
not possess much of the divine afflatus myself; 
but there has ever lurked writhin me some sort 
of ambition to w^rite a book — something held 
together by "tree calf," "half morocco," or 
" boards " ; something that might find its way 
into the hearts and homes of an enlightened 
public ; something which will give some of my 
young fi-iends ample opportunity for criticism. 
In the exercise of my profession I have written 
leagues of descriptive " copy " — mostly lies and 
racing selections, — but up to now there has been 
no urgent demand for a book of any sort from 
this pen. For years my ambition has remained 
ungratified. Publishers — as a rule, the most faint- 
hearted and least speculative of mankind — have 
held aloof. And whatever suggestions I might 
make were rejected, with determination, if not 
with contumely. 

At length came the hour, and the man ; the 
introduction to a publisher with an eye for 
budding and hitherto misdirected talent. 

" Do you care, sir," I inquired at the outset,' 



PREFACE xt 

" to undertake the dissemination of a bulky work 
on Political Economy ? " 

"Frankly, sir, I do not," was the reply. 
Then I tried him with various subjects — social 
reform, the drama, bimetallism, the ethics of 
starting prices, the advantages of motor cars in 
African warfare, natural history, the martyrdom 
of Ananias, practical horticulture, military law, 
and dogs ; until he took down an old duck-gun 
from a peg over the mantelpiece, and assumed a 
threatening attitude. 

Peace having been restored, the self-repetition 
of history recommenced. 

" I can do with a good, bold, brilliant, lightly 
treated, exhaustive work on Gastronomy," said 
the publisher, " you are well acquainted with the 
subject, I believe ? " 

" Fm a bit of a parlour cook, if that's what 
you mean," was my humble reply. " At a salad, 
a grill, an anchovy toast, or a cooling and cun- 
ningly compounded cup, I can be underwritten 
at ordinary rates. But I could no more cook a 
haunch of venison, or even boil a rabbit, or make 
an economical Christmas pudding, than I could 
sail a boat in a nor'-easter ; and Madam Cook 
would certainly eject me from her kitchen, with 
a clout attached to the hem of my dinner jacket, 
inside five minutes." 

Eventually it was decided that I should com- 
mence this book. 



xii CAKES AND ALE 

" What I want," said the publisher, " is a 
series of essays on food, a few anecdotes of stirring 
adventure — you have a fine flow of imagination, 
I understand — and a few useful, but uncommon 
recipes. But plenty of plums in the book, my 
dear sir, plenty of plums." 

" But, suppose my own supply of plums should 
not hold out, what am I to do ? " 

" What do you do — what does the cook do, 
when the plums for her pudding run short ? Get 
some more ; the Museum, my dear sir, the great 
storehouse of national literature, is free to all 
whose character is above the normal standard. " 
When your memory and imagination fail, try the 
British Museum. You know what is a mightier 
factor than both sword and pen ? Precisely so. 
And remember that in replenishing your store 
from the works of those who have gone before, 
you are only following in their footsteps. I only 
bar Sydney Smith and Charles Lamb. Let me 
have the script by Christmas — d'you smoke ? — 
mind the step — good morning." 

In this way, gentle reader, were the trenches 
dug, the saps laid for the attack of the great work. 
The bulk of it is original, and the adventures in 
which the writer has taken part are absolutely 
true. About some of the others I would not be 
so positive. Some of the recipes have previously 
figured in the pages of the Sporting Times^ the 
Lady's Pictorial^ and the Man of the World^ to 



PREFACE xiii 

the proprietors of which journals I hereby express 
my kindly thanks for permission to revive them. 
Many of the recipes are original ; some are my 
ow^n ; others have been sent in by relatives, and 
friends of my youth ; others have been adapted 
for modern requirements from works of great 
antiquity ; whilst others again — I am nothing if 
not candid — have been " conveyed ** from the 
works of more modern writers, who in their turn 
had borrowed them from the works of their 
ancestors. There is nothing new under the sun ; 
and there are but few absolute novelties which 
are subjected to the heat of the kitchen fire. 

If the style of the work be faulty, the reason — 
not the excuse — is that the style is innate, and 
not modelled upon anybody else's style. The 
language I have endeavoured to make as plain, 
homely, and vigorous as is the food advocated. If 
the criticisms on foreign cookery should offend 
the talented chef^ I have the satisfaction of know- 
ing that, as I have forsworn his works, he will 
be unable to retaliate with poison. And if the 
criticism? on the modern English methods of 
preparing tood should attract the attention of the 
home caterer, he may possibly be induced to give 
his steam-chest and his gas-range a rest, and put 
the roast beef of Old England on his table, 
occasionally ; though I have only the very faintest 
hopes that he will do so. For the monster eating- 
houses and mammoth hotels of to-day are for the 



xiv CAKES AND ALE 

most part " run " by companies and syndicates ; 
and the company within the dining-room suffer 
occasionally, in order that dividends may be 
possible after payment has been made for the 
elaborate, and wholly unnecessary, furniture, and 
decorations. Wholesome food is usually sufficient 
for the ordinary British appetite, without such 
surroundings as marble pillars, Etruscan vases, 
nude figures, gilding, and looking-glasses, which 
only serve to distract attention from the banquet. 
It is with many a sigh that I recall the good old- 
fashioned inn, where the guest really received a 
warm welcome. Nowadays, the warmest part of 
that welcome is usually the bill. 

It is related of the wittiest man of the nine- 
teenth century, my late friend Mr. Henry J. 
Byron, that, upon one occasion, whilst walking 
home with a brother dramatist, after the first 
performance of his comedy, which had failed to 
please the audience, Byron shed tears. 

" How is this ? " inquired his friend. " The 
failure of my play appears to affect you strangely." 

" I was only weeping," was the reply, " because 
I was afraid you'd set to work, and write another." 

But there need be no tears shed on any page 
of this food book. For I am not going to 
" write another."

BREAKFAST 



" The day breaks slow, but e'en must man break-fast." 

formal or informal? — An eccentric old gentleman — The 
ancient Britons — Breakfast in the days of Good ^ueen 
Bess — A few tea statistics — *' Garraway's " — Something 
about coffee — Brandy for breakfast — The evolution of the 
staff of life — Free Trade — The cheap loaf, and no cash to 
buy it. 

This is a very serious subject. The first meal 
of the day has exercised more influence over 
history than many people may be aware of. It 
is not easy to preserve an equal mind or keep a 
stiff upper lip upon an empty stomach ; and in- 
digestible food -stuffs have probably lost more 
battles than sore feet and bad ammunition. It 
is an incontestable fact that the great Napoleon 
lost the battles of Borodino and Leipsic through 
eating too fast. 

When good digestion waits on appetite, great 
men are less liable to commit mistakes — and a 
mistake in a great man is a crime — than when 
dyspepsia has marked them for her own ; and 
this rule appHes to all men. 

There should be no hurry or formality about 



3 CAKES AND ALE 

breakfast. Your punctual host and hostess may 
be all very well from their own point of view ; 
but black looks and sarcastic welcomings are an 
abomination to the guest who may have overslept 
himself or herself, and who fails to say, " Good- 
morning" just on the stroke of nine o'clock. 
Far be it from the author's wish to decry the 
system of family prayers, although the spectacle 
of the full strength of the domestic company, 
from the stern-featured housekeeper, or the chief 
lady's-maid (the housekeeper is frequently too 
grand, or too much cumbered with other duties 
to attend public worship), to the diminutive page- 
boy, standing all in a row, facing the cups and 
saucers, is occasionally more provocative of mirth 
than reverence. But too much law and order 
about fast-breaking is to be deplored. 

" I'm not very punctual, I'm afraid. Sir John," 
I once heard a very charming lady observe to her 
host, as she took her seat at the table, exactly ten 
minutes after the line of menials had filed out. 

"On the contrary. Lady V " returned the 

master of the house, with a cast-iron smile, " you 
are punctual in your unpunctuality ; for you have 
missed prayers by the sixth part of one hour, 
every morning since you came." Now what 
should be done to a host like that ? 

In the long ago I was favoured with the 
acquaintance of an elderly gentleman of property, 
a most estimable, though eccentric, man. And 
he invariably breakfasted with his hat on. It did 
not matter if ladies were present or not. Down 
he would sit, opposite the ham and eggs — or 
whatever dish it might chance to be — with a 



BREAKFAST 3 

white hat, with mourning band attached, sur- 
mounting his fine head. We used to think the 
presence of the hat was owing to partial baldness ; 
but, as he never wore it at luncheon or dinner, 
that idea was abandoned. In fact, he pleaded that 
the hat kept his thoughts in ; and as after break- 
fast he was closeted with his steward, or agent, 
or stud-groom, or keeper, for several hours, he 
doubtless let loose some of those thoughts to one 
or the other. At all events we never saw him 
again till luncheon, unless there was any hunt- 
ing or shooting to be done. 

This same old gentleman once rehearsed his 
own funeral on the carriage drive outside, and 
stage-managed the solemn ceremony from his 
study window. An under-gardener pushed a 
wheelbarrow, containing a box of choice cuttings, 
to represent the body ; and the butler posed as 
chief mourner. And when anybody went 
wrong, or the pall-bearers — six grooms — failed to 
keep in step, the master would throw up the 
window-sash, and roar — 

" Begin again ! " 

But this is wandering from the subject. Let 
us try back. 

Having made wide search amongst old and 
musty manuscripts, I can find no record of a 
bill-of-fare of the first meal of the ancient 
Britons. Our blue forefathers, in all probability, 
but seldom assisted at any such smart function as 
a wedding-breakfast, or even a hunting one ; 
for the simple reason that it was a case with 
them of, "no hunt, no breakfast." Unless one 
or other had killed the deer, or the wild-boar, or 



4 CAKES AND ALE 

some other living thing to furnish the refection 
the feast was a Barmecide one, and much as we 
have heard of the strength and hardiness of our 
blue forefathers, many of them must have died of 
sheer starvation. For they had no weapons but 
clubs, and rough cut flints, with which to kill 
the beasts of the country — who were, however, 
occasionally lured into pitfalls ; and as to fish, 
unless they " tickled " them, the denizens of the 
streams must have had an easy time of it. They 
had sheep, but these were valuable chiefly on 
account of their wool ; as used to be the case in 
Australia, ere the tinned meat trade was estab- 
lished. Most of the fruits and vegetables which 
we enjoy to-day were introduced into Britain 
by the Romans. Snipe and woodcock and (in 
the north) grouse may have been bagged, as well 
as hares. But these poor savages knew not 
rabbits by sight, nor indeed, much of the feathered 
fowl which their more favoured descendants are 
in the habit of shooting, or otherwise destroying, 
for food. The ancient Britons knew not bacon 
and eggs, nor the toothsome kipper, nor yet the 
marmalade of Dundee. As for bread, it was not 
invented in any shape or form until much later ; 
and its primitive state was a tough paste of flour, 
water, and (occasionally) milk — something like 
the " damper " of the Australian bush, or the 
unleavened chupati which the poorer classes in 
Hindustan put up with, after baking it, at the 
present day. 

The hardy, independent Saxon, had a much 
better time of it, in the way of meat and drink. 
But with supper forming the chief meal of the 



BREAKFAST 5 

day, his breakfast was a simple, though plentiful 
one, and consisted chiefly of venison pasty and 
the flesh of goats, washed down with ale, or 
mead. 

"A free breakfast-table of Elizabeth's time," 
says an old authority, "or even during the more 
recent reign of Charles II., would contrast oddly 
with our modern morning meal. There were 
meats, hot and cold j beef and brawn, and boar's 
head, the venison pasty, and the 

Wardon Pie 

of west country pears. There was hot bread, 
too, and sundry ' cates ' which would now be 
strange to our eyes. But to wash down these 
substantial viands there was little save ale. The 
most delicate lady could procure no more suitable 
beverage than the blood of John Barleycorn. 
The most fretful invalid had to be content 
with a mug of small beer, stirred up with a sprig 
of rosemary. Wine, hippocras, and methegHn 
were potations for supper-time, not for breakfast, 
and beer reigned supreme. None but home pro- 
ductions figured on the board of our ancestors. 
Not for them were seas traversed, or tropical 
shores visited, as for us. Yemen and Ceylon, 
Assam and Cathay, Cuba and Peru, did not send 
daily tribute to their tables, and the very names 
of tea and coffee, of cocoa and chocolate, were 
to them unknown. The dethronement of ale, 
subsequent on the introduction of these eastern 
products, is one of^he most marked events which 
have severed the social life of the present day from 
that of the past." 



6 CAKES AND ALE 

With the exception of the Warden pie and 
the " cates," the above bill-of-fare would probably 
satisfy the cravings of the ordinary "Johnny" of 
to-day, who has heard the chimes at midnight, 
and would sooner face a charging tiger than 
drink tea or coffee with his first meal, which, 
alas ! but too often consists of a hot -pickle 
sandwich and a "brandy and soda," with not 
quite all the soda in. But just imagine the fine 
lady of to-day with a large tankard of Burton 
ale facing her at the breakfast- table, 

which is said to have been introduced into China 
by Djarma, a native of India, about a.d. 500, 
was not familiar in Europe until the end of the 
sixteenth century. And it was not until 1657, 
when Garraway opened a tea-house in Exchange 
Alley, that Londoners began tea-drinking as an 
experiment. In 1662 Pepys writes — 

" Home, and there find my wife making of 
tea" — two years before, he called it "tee (a 
China drink)" — "a drink which Mr. Felling the 
Pothicary tells her is good for her cold and 
defluxions." 

In 1740 the price of tea ranged from 7s. to 
24s. per lb. In 1725, 370,323 lbs. were drunk 
in England, and in 1890, 194,008,000. In 
1840 the duty was 2s. 2\d. per lb.; in 1858 
IS. 5d. per lb. ; and in 1890 4d. per lb.

root, or road-scrapings, forms a most agreeable 
beverage to those who can digest it, was not 
known to the Greeks or Romans, but has been 
used in Abyssinia and along the north-east coast 
of Africa almost as long as those parts have been 
populated. Here, in merry England, where 
cofFee was not introduced until the eighteenth 
century, it was at first used but sparingly, untii 
it almost entirely took the place of chocolate, 
which was the favoured beverage of the duchesses 
and fine madams who minced and flirted, and 
plotted, during the reign of the Merry Monarch, 
fifty years or so before. The march of know- 
ledge has taught the thrifty housewife of to-day 
to roast her own cofFee, instead of purchasing it 
in that form from the retail shopkeeper, who, as 
a rule, under-roasts the berry, in order to " keep 
the weight in." But do not blame him too 
freely, for he is occasionally a Poor Law Guardian, 
and has to " keep pace with the Stores." 

During the Georgian era, the hard-drinking 
epoch, breakfast far too often consisted chiefly 
of French brandy ; and the first meal was, in 
consequence, not altogether a happy or whole- 
some one, nor conducive to the close study of 
serious subjects. 

The history of 

The Staff of Life^ 

would require a much larger volume than this, 
all to itself. That the evolution of bread-making 
has been very gradual admits of no denial ; and 

^ It is incorrect to speak of bread as the sole " staff of life." 
Eggs, milk, cheese, potatoes, and some other vegetables, supply

as late as the Tudor and Stuart periods the art 
was still in its infancy. The quality of the 
bread consumed was a test of social standing. 
Thus, whilst the haut monde^ the height of 
society, lords and dukes, with countesses and 
dames of high degree, were in the habit of 
consuming delicate manchets, made of the finest 
wheaten flour, of snowy purity, the middle classes 
had to content themselves with white loaves of 
inferior quality. To the journeyman and the 
'prentice (who had to endure, with patience, the 
buffets of master and mistress) was meted out 
coarse but wholesome brown bread, made from 
an admixture of wheat and barley flour ; whilst 
the agricultural labourer staved off starvation 
with loaves made from rye, occasionally mixed 
with red wheat or barley. The introduction of 

Free Trade 

— by no means an unmixed blessing — has changed 
all this ; and the working-classes, with their wives 
and families, can, when out of the workhouse, in 
the intervals between "strikes," enjoy the same 
quality of bread, that " cheap loaf " which appears 
on the table of the wicked squire and the all- 
devouring parson. In Yorkshire, at the present day, 
almost the worst thing that can be urged against 
a woman is that she " canna mak' a bit o' bread." 
"Just look," wrote an enthusiastic Free Trader, 
a quarter of a century ago," at the immense change 

between them far more phosphoric acid than is to be got from 
bread, either white or brown. And a man could support 
existence on " beer and baccy " as well as he could do so on bread 
alone. 



BREAKFAST 9 

that has latterly taken place in the food of the 
English peasantry. Rye bread and pease-pudding 
exchanged for wheaten loaves. A startling 
change, but not greatly different from what has 
occurred in France, where, with the abuses of 
the Bourbon rule, an end was put to the semi- 
starvation of French tillers of the soil. Black 
bread is now almost as much a rarity in France 
as on our side of the Channel ; while barley in 
Wales, oats in Scotland, and the potato in Ireland, 
are no longer the food-staples that they were." 

I have no wish for anything of a contentious 
nature to appear in this volume ; but may deliver, 
with regard to the above, the opmion that pease- 
pudding is by no means despicable fare, when 
associated with a boiled leg of pork ; and I may 
add that too many of the English peasantry, 
nowadays, have been reduced, by this same Free 
Trade, to a diet of no bread at all, in place of 
wheaten, or any other loaves. 

Wedding breakfasts, with the formal speeches, 
and cutting of the cake, have gone out of fashion, 
and the subject of the British breakfast of to-day 
demands a new chapter. 



CHAPTER II 

BREAKFAST [continued) 

"Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table." 

Country-house life — An Englishwoman at her best — Guests' 
comforts — What to eat at the first meal — A few choice 
recipes — A noble grill-sauce — The poor outcast — Appetising 
dishes — Hotel "worries" — The old regime and the new — 
"No cheques"; no soles, and "whitings is hoft" — A 
halibut steak — Skilly and oakum — Breakfast out of the 
rates. 

By far the pleasantest meal of the day at a large 
country-house is breakfast. You will be staying 
there, most likely, an you be a man, for hunting 
or shooting — it being one of the eccentric dis- 
pensations of the great goddess Fashion that 
country-houses should be guestless, and often 
ownerless, during that season of the year when 
nature looks at her loveliest. An you be a 
woman, you will be staying there for the especial 
benefit of your daughter ; for flirting — or for 
the more serious purpose of riveting the fetters 
of the fervid youth who may have been taken 
captive during the London season — for romping, 
and probably shooting and hunting, too ; for lovely 



BREAKFAST ii 

woman up-to-date takes but little account of such 
frivolities as Berlin wool-work, piano-practice, 
or drives, well wrapped-up, in a close carriage, 
to pay calls with her hostess. As for going out 
with the " guns," or meeting the sterner sex at 
luncheon in the keeper's cottage, or the specially- 
erected pavi'.ion, the darlings are not content, 
nowadays, unless they can use dapper little 
breechloaders, specially made for them, and some 
of them are far from bad shots. 

Yes, 'tis a pleasant function, breakfast at the 
Castle, the Park, or the Grange. But, as observed 
in the last chapter, there must be no undue 
punctuality, no black looks at late arrivals, no 
sarcastic allusions to late hours, nor inane chafF 
from the other guests about the wine cup or the 
whisky cup, which may have been drained in the 
smoking-room, during the small hours. 

Her ladyship looks divine, or at all events 
regal, as she presides at what our American 
cousins would call the " business end " of the 
long table, whilst our host, a healthy, jolly- 
looking, "hard-bitten" man of fifty, faces her. 
His bright keen eye denotes the sportsman, and 
he can shoot as straight as ever, whilst no fence 
is too high, too wide, nor too deep for him. 
Sprinkled about, at either side of the table, 
amongst the red and black coats, or shooting 
jackets of varied hues — with a vacancy here and 
there, for « Algie " and « Bill," and the " Angel," 
who have not yet put in appearance — arc 
smart, fresh-looking women, young, and "well- 
preserved," and matronly, some in tailor-made 
frocks, and some in the silks and velvets suited

1* CAKES AND ALE 

for those of riper age, and some in exquisitely- 
fitting habits. It is at the breakfast-table that the 
Englishwoman can defy all foreign competition ; 
and you are inclined to frown, or even say things 
under your breath, when that mincing, wicked- 
looking little Marquise^ all frills, and ribbons, 
and lace, and smiles, and Ess Bouquet, in the 
latest creation of the first man-milliner of Paris, 
trips into the room in slippers two sizes too 
small for her, and salutes the company at large in 
broken English. For the contrast is somewhat 
trying, and you wonder why on earth some 
women will smother themselves with scents and 
cosmetiques^ and raddle their cheeks and wear 
diamonds so early in the morning ; and you lose 
all sense of the undoubted fascination of the 
Marquise in speculating as to what manner of 
" strong woman " her femme de chamhre must be 
who can compress a 22-inch waist into an 18- 
inch corset. 

There should, of course, be separate tea and 
coffee equipments for most of the guests — at all 
events for the sluggards. The massive silver 
urn certainly lends a tone to the breakfast-table, 
and looks "comfortable-like." But it would be 
criminally cruel to satisfy the thirst of the multi- 
tude out of the same tea-pot or cofFee-pot ; and 
the sluggard will not love his hostess if she pours 
forth "husband*s tea," merely because he is a 
sluggard. And remember that the hand which 
has held two by honours, or a " straight flush " 
the night before, is occasionally too shaky to pass 
tea-cups. No. Do not spare your servants, my 
lord, or my lady. Your guests must be "well 



BREAKFAST 13 

done," or they will miss your " rocketing " 
pheasants, or fail to go fast enough at that brook 
with the rotten banks. 

" The English," said an eminent alien, " have 
only one sauce." This is a scandalous libel -, but 
as it was said a long time ago it doesn't matter. 
It would be much truer to say that the English 
have only one breakfast-dish, and its name is 

Eggs and Bacon. 

Pardon, I should have written two ; and the 
second is ham and eggs. A new-laid egg — 
poached, not fried, an ye love me, O Betsy, best 
of cooks — and a rasher of home-cured hog are 
both excellent things in their way ; but, like a 
partridge, a mother-in-law, and a baby, it is quite 
possible to have too much of them. The 
English hostess — I do not refer to the typical 
''her ladyship," of whom I have written above, 
but to the average hostess — certainly launches 
out occasionally in the direction of assorted fish, 
kidneys, sausages, and chops, but the staple food 
upon which we are asked to break our fast is, 
undoubtedly, eggs and bacon. 

The great question of what to eat at the first 
meal depends greatly upon whether you sit down 
to it directly you emerge from your bedroom, or 
whether you have indulged in any sort of exercise 
in the interim. After two or three hours 
"amateur touting" on such a place as New- 
market Heath, the sportsman is ready for any 
sort of food, from a dish of liver and bacon to a 
good, thick fat chop, or an underdone steak. I 
have even attacked cold stewed eels (!) upon an 



14. CAKES AND ALE 

occasion when the pangs of hunger would have 
justified my eating the tom-cat, and the land- 
lady as well. But chops and steaks are not to be 
commended to furnish forth the ordinary break- 
fast-table. I am coming to the hotel breakfast 
presently, so will say nothing about fried fish 
just yet. But here follows a list of a few of what 
may be called 

Allmjuahle Breakfast Dishes 

Mushrooms (done plainly in front of the fire), 
sausages (toasted), scrambled eggs on toast, 
curried eggs, fish balls, kidneys, savoury omelette. 
Porridge may be useful for growing boys and 
briefless barristers, but this chapter is not written 
solely in their interests. Above all, do not, oh ! 
do not, forget the grill, or broil. This should be 
the feature of the breakfast. Such simple recipes 
as those for the manufacture of fish balls or 
omelettes or curried eggs — though I shall have 
plenty to say about curries later on — need not be 
given here ; but the following, for a grill-sauce, 
will be found invaluable, especially for the 
" sluggard." 

Gubhins Sauce 

The legs and wings of fowl, turkey, pheasant, 
partridge, or moor-hen should only be used. Have 
these scored across with a sharp knife, and divided 
at the joints. And when your grill is taken, " hot 
as hot," but not hurnt, from the fire, have poured 
over it the following sauce. Be very particular 
that your cook pours it over the grill just before it 
is served up. And it is of the most vital importance 
that the sauce should be made, and well mixed, on 



BREAKFAST 15 

a plate over hot water — for instance, a slop-basin 
should be filled with boiling water and a plate 
placed atop. 

Melt on the plate a lump of butter the size of a 
large walnut. Stir into it, when melted, two tea- 
spoonfuls of made mustard, then a dessert-spoonful 
of vinegar, half that quantity of tarragon vinegar, 
and a table-spoonful of cream — Devonshire or 
English. Season with salt, black pepper, and 
cayenne, according to the (presumed) tastes and 
requirements of the breakfasters. 

Let your sideboard — it is assumed that you 
have a sideboard — sigh and lament its hard lot, 
under its load of cold joints, game, and pies, 
— I am still harping on the country-house ; and 
if you have a York ham in cut, it should be 
flanked by a Westphalian ditto. For the blend 
is a good one. And remember that no York 
ham under 2olb. in weight is worth cutting. 
You need not put it all on the board at once. 
A capital adjunct to the breakfast-table, too, is a 
reindeer's tongue, which, as you see it hung up in 
the shops, looks more like a policeman's truncheon 
in active employment than anything else ; but 
when well soaked and then properly treated in 
the boiling, is very tasty, and will melt like 
marrow in the mouth. 

A simple, excellent August breakfast can be 
made from a dish of freshly-caught trout, the legs 
and back of a cold grouse, which has been roasted, 
not baked, and 

A Large Peach, 

But what of the wretched bachelor, as he 



i6 CAKES AND ALE 

enters his one sitting-room, in his humble lodg- 
ing ? He may have heard the chimes at mid- 
night, in some gay and festive quarter, or, like 
some other wretched bachelors, he may have 
been engaged in the composition of romances 
for some exacting editor, until the smallish 
hours. Poor outcast ! what sort of appetite will 
he have for the rusty rasher, or the shop egg, the 
smoked haddock, or the " Billingsgate pheasant," 
which his landlady will presently send up, to- 
gether with her little account, for his refection ? 
Well, here is a much more tasty dish than any 
of the above ; and if he be "square" with Mrs. 
Bangham, that lady will possibly not object to 
her "gal" cooking the different ingredients 
before she starts at the wash-tub. But let not 
the wretched bachelor suffer the "gal" to mix 
them. 

I first met this dish in Calcutta during the 
two months of (alleged) cold weather which 
prevail during the year. 

Calcutta Jumble. 

A few fried fillets of white fish (sole, or plaice — 
sole for choice), placed on the top of some boiled 
rice, in a soup plate. Pour over them the yolks of 
two boiled eggs, and mix in one green chili, chopped 
fine. Salt to taste. 

" Another way : " 

Mix with the rice the following ingredients : — 

The yolks of two r/jzv eggs, one table-spoonful 

anchovy sauce, one small teaspoonful curry powder 

(raw), a sprinkling of cayenne, a little salt, and one 

green chili chopped fine. Each ingredient to be 



BREAKFAST 17 

added separately, and the eggs and curry powder to 
be stirred into the rice with a fork. Fillets of sole 
to be served atop. 

How many cooks in this England of ours can 
cook rice properly ? Without pausing for a 
reply, I append the recipe, which should be 
pasted on the wall of every kitchen. The many 
cookery books which I have read give elaborate 
directions for the performance of what is a very 
simple duty. Here it is, in a few lines — 

To cook Rice for Curry ^ etc. 
Soak a sufficiency of rice in cold water for two 
hours. Strain through a sieve, and pop the rice into 
boiling water. Let it boil — " gallop " is, I believe, 
the word used in most kitchens — for not quite ten 
minutes (or until the rice is tender), then strain oiF 
the water through a sieve, and dash a little cold 
water over the rice, to separate the grains. 

Here is another most appetising breakfast 
dish for the springtime — 

Asparagus with Eggs. 
Cut up two dozen (or so) heads of cooked 
asparagus into small pieces, and mix in a stewpan 
with the well -beaten yolks of two raw eggs. 
Flavour with pepper and salt, and stir freely. Add 
a piece of butter the size of a walnut (one of these 
should be kept in every kitchen as a pattern), and 
keep on stirring for a couple of minutes or so. 
Serve on delicately-toasted bread. 

Jn Hotel Breakfast, 
What memories do these words conjure up of 
a snug coffee-room, hung with hunting prints. 



iS CAKES AND ALE 

and portraits of Derby winners, and churches, 
and well-hung game ; with its oak panellings, 
easy arm-chairs, blazing fire, snowy naperies, 
and bright silver. The cheery host, with well- 
lined paunch, and fat, wheezy voice, which 
wishes you good-morning, and hopes you have 
passed a comfortable night between the lavender- 
scented sheets. The fatherly interest which 
" William," the grey - headed waiter, takes in 
you — stranger or habitue — and the more than 
fatherly interest which you take in the good 
cheer, from home-made " sassingers " to new-laid 
eggs, and heather honey, not forgetting a slice 
out of the mammoth York ham, beneath whose 
weight the old sideboard absolutely grunts. 

Heigho ! we, or they, have changed all that. 
The poet who found his " warmest welcome in 
an inn " was, naturally enough, writing of his 
own time. I don't like fault-finding, but must 
needs declare that the "warmest" part of an 
inn welcome to be found nowadays is the bill. 
As long as you pay it (or have plenty of luggage 
to leave behind in default), and make yourself 
agreeable to the fair and haughty bookkeeper 
(if it's a "she") who allots you your bedroom, 
and bullies the pageboy, nobody in the modern 
inn cares particularly what becomes of you. You 
lose your individuality, and become " Number 
325." Instead of welcome, distrust lurks, large, 
on the very threshold. 

"iVd? Cheques Accepted^' 

is frequently the first announcement to catch the 
eye of the incoming guest j and although you 



BREAKFAST 19 

cannot help admiring the marble pillars, the oak 
carving, the gilding, the mirrors, and the electric 
light, an uncomfortable feeling comes over you 
at meal times, to the effect that the cost of the 
decorations, or much of it, is taken out of the 
food. 

" Waiter," you ask, as soon as your eyes and 
ears get accustomed to the incessant bustle of 
the cofFee-room, and your nostrils to the savour 
of last night's soup, " vi^hat can I have for 
breakfast ? " 

"What would you like, sir ? " 

"I should Hke a grilled sole, to begin w^ith.** 

" Very sorry, sir, soles is hofF — get you a nice 
chop or steak." 

"Can't manage either so early in the day. 
Got any w^hitings ? " 

"Afraid we're out of whitings, sir, but I'll 
see." 

Eventually, after suggesting sundry delicacies, 
all of which are either "hoflF," or unknown to 
the waiter, you settle down to the consumption 
of two fried and shrivelled shop eggs, on an 
island of Chicago ham, floating in an iEgean Sea 
of grease and hot water ; whilst a half quartern 
loaf, a cruet-stand the size of a cathedral, a 
rackful of toast of the " Zebra " brand, and about 
two gallons of (alleged) coffee, are dumped down 
in succession in front of you. 

There are, of course, some hostelries where 
they "do" you better than this, but my ex- 
perience of hotel breakfasts at this end of the 
nineteenth century has not been encouraging, 
either to appetite or temper ; and I do vow and 



ao CAKES AND ALE 

protest that the above picture is not too highly 
coloured. 

The toothsome, necessary bloater is not often 
to be met with on the hotel's bill-of-fare j but, 
if soft roed — use no other — it will repay perusal. 
Toast it in a Dutch oven in front of a clear fire, 
and just before done split it up the back, and put 
a piece of butter on it. The roe should be well 
plumped, and of the consistency of Devonshire 
cream. A grilled sole for breakfast is preferable 
to a fried one, principally because it is by no 
means impossible that the fried sole be second- 
hand, or as the French call it rechauffe. And 
why, unless directions to the contrary be given, 
is the modest whiting invariably placed, tail in 
mouth, on the frying pan ? A grilled whiting 
— assassinate your cook an she (or he) scorches 
it — is one of the noblest works of the kitchen, and 
its exterior should be of a golden brown colour. 

Do not forget to order sausages for breakfast if 
you are staying at Newmarket ; there is less 
bread in them than in the Metropolitan brand. 
And when in Lincoln attempt a 

Halibut Steak^ 

of which you may not have previously heard. 
The halibut should, previous to grilling or frying 
in salad oil^ be placed on a shallow dish and 
sprinkled with salt. Then the dish should be 
half filled with water, which must not cover the 
salt. Leave the fish to soak for an hour, then 
cut into slices, nearly an inch thick, without 
removing the skin. Sprinkle some lemon juice 
and cayenne over the steaks before serving. 



BREAKFAST 21 

If you wish to preserve an even mind, and be 
at peace with the world, a visit to 

The Hotel Parish 

is not to be recommended. The Irish stew at 
dinner is not bad in its way, though coarse, and 
too Hberally endowed with fat. But the break- 
fasts ! Boiled oatmeal and water, with salt in 
the mess, and a chunk of stale brown bread to 
eat therewith, do not constitute an altogether 
satisfactory meal, the first thing in the morning ; 
and it is hardly calculated to inspire him with 
much pride in his work, when the guest is placed 
subsequently before his " task " of unbroken flints 
or tarred rope. 



CHAPTER III 
BREAKFAST [continued) 

** There's nought in the Highlands but syboes and leeks, 
And lang-leggit callants gaun wanting the breeks." 

Bonnie Scotland — Parritch an' cream — Fin'an baddies — A knife 
on the ocean wave — vf la Fran^ais — In the gorgeous East 
— C/wta kazri — English as she is spoke — Dak bungalow fare 
— Some quaint dishes — Breakfast with "my tutor" — A 
Don's absence of mind. 

For a "warm welcome" commend me to Bonnie 
Scotland. Though hard of head and " sae fu* o' 
learning " that they are " owre deeficult to con- 
veence, ye ken," these rugged Caledonians be 
tender of heart, and philanthropic to a degree. 
Hech, sirs ! but *tis the braw time ye'll hae, gin 
ye trapese the Highlands, an' the Lowlands as 
well for the matter o* that — in search o* guid 
refreshment for body an* soul. 

Even that surly lexicographer, Doctor Samuel 
Johnson (who, by the way, claimed the same 
city for his birthplace as does the writer), who 
could not be induced to recognise the merits of 
Scotch scenery, and preferred Fleet Street to 



BREAKFAST as 

the Trossachs, extolled the luxury vf a Scotch 
breakfast above that of all other countiies. And 
Sir Walter Scott, who never enthused much about 
meat and drink, is responsible in Waverley for 
a passage calculated to make the mouths of most 
people w^ater : 

" He found Miss Bradwardine presiding over 
the tea and coffee, the table loaded with warm 
bread, both of flour, oatmeal, and barley meal, in 
the shape of loaves, cakes, biscuits, and other 
varieties, together with eggs, reindeer ham, 
mutton and beef ditto, smoked salmon, and 
many other delicacies. A mess of oatmeal 
porridge, flanked by a silver jug which held an 
equal mixture of cream and buttermilk, was 
placed for the Baron's share of the repast." 

"And," as Mr. Samuel Weller would have 
observed, " a wery good idea of a breakfast, too." 

A beef-ham sounds like a " large order " for 
breakfast, even when we come to consider that 
the Scotch " beastie," in Sir Walter Scott's time, 
was wanting in " beam " and stature. I have 
seen and partaken of a ham cut from a Yorkshire 
pig, and weighing 52 lbs. j but even a Scotch 
beef- ham must have topped that weight con- 
siderably. Fortunately the sideboards of those 
times were substantial of build. 

Missing from the above bill-of-fare is the 
haddock. 

The FirCan Haddie^ 

a bird which at that period had probably not been 
invented. But the modern Scottish breakfast- 
table is not properly furnished without it. The 



H CAKES AND ALE 

genuine " Fin'an " is known by its appetising 
savour and by its colour — a creamy yellow, which 
is totally distinct from the Vandyke browny hue 
of the haddock which is creosoted in the neigh-

"Strip off the skin," says the recipe in one cookery 
book, "and broil before the fire or over a quick 
clear one." Another way — my way^ is not to 
strip off the skin and to steam your baddies. 
Place them in a dish which has been previously 
heated. Throw boiling water on them, and 
cover closely with a plate ; place on a hot stove, 
and in from lo to 15 minutes the Fin'ans will 
be accomplished. Drain, and serve hot as hot, 
buttered, with a sprinkling of cayenne, and, may- 
be, a dash of Worcester sauce. 

Salmon is naturally a welcome guest at the 
table of the land of his birth, served fresh when 
in season, and smoked or kippered at all times. 

A Salmon Steak 

with the " curd " between the flakes, placed 
within a coat of virgin-white paper (oiled) and 
grilled for 15 minutes or so, is an excellent 
breakfast dish. A fry of small troutlets, a ditto 
of the deer's interior economy— Af^w. When up 
at the death of a hunted stag, always beg or 
annex a portion of his liver — are also common 
dishes at the first me^l ^crved by the"gudewife"; 
and I once met a cold haggis at 9.30 a.m. But 
this, I rather fancy, was "a wee bit joke " at my 
expense. Anyhow I shall have plenty to say 
about the " great chieftain o* the puddin' race " 
in a later chapter. 



BREAKFAST 15 

Off to Gold-land! 

Those that go down to the sea in ships, and 
can summon up sufficient presence of mind to 
go down to the saloon at meal times, have far 
from a bad time of it. Living was certainly 
better on the ocean wave in the days when live- 
stock was kept on board, and slaughtered as 
required ; for the effect of keeping beef, pork, 
and mutton in a refrigerating chamber for any 
length of time is to destroy the flavour, and 
to render beef indistinguishable from the flesh of 
the hog, and mutton as tasteless as infantine pap. 
But the ship's galley does its little utmost ; and 
the saloon passenger, on his way to the other side 
of the equator, may regale himself with such a 
breakfast as the following, which is taken from 
the steward's book of a vessel belonging to the 
Union Line : — 

Porridge, fillets of haddock with fine herbs, mutton 
chops and chip potatoes, savoury omelet, bacon on 
toast, minced collops, curry and rice, fruit, rolls, 
toast, etc., tea and coffee. 

Cannot my readers imagine a steward entering 
the state-room of the voyager who has succumbed 
to the wiles, and eccentricities of the Bay of 
Biscay, with the observation: "Won't you get 
up to breakfast, sir ? — I've reserved a beautiful fat 
chop, with chips, o' purpose for you, sir." 

And the lot of the third-class passenger who 
is conveyed from his native land to the Cape of 
Good Hope, for what Mr. Montague Tigg would 
have called "the ridiculous sum of" ^16 : 16s., 



16 CAKES AND ALE 

is no such hard one, seeing that he is allotted a 
" bunk " in a compact, t'lough comfortable cabin, 
and may break his fast on the following substan- 
tial meal : — 

Porridge, Yarmouth bloaters, potatoes, American 
hash, grilled mutton, bread and butter, tea or coffee. 

An American breakfast is as variegated (and I 
fear I must add, as indigestible) as a Scotch one ; 
and included in the bill of fare are as many, or 
more, varieties of bread and cake as are to be 
found in the land o' shortbread. The writer has, 
in New York, started the morning meal with 
oysters, run the gamut of fish, flesh, and fowl, 
and wound up with buckwheat cakes, which are 
brought on in relays, buttered and smoking hot, 
and can be eaten with or without golden syrup. 
Bnt^ a3 business begins early in New York and 
other large cities, scant attention is paid to the 
first meal by the merchant and the speculator, 
who are wont to " gallop " through breakfast and 
luncheon, and to put in their " best work " at 
dinner. 

A Mediterranean Breakfast 

is not lacking in poetry ; and the jaded denizen 
of Malta can enjoy red mullet (the "woodcock 
of the sea " ) freshly taken from the tideless 
ocean, and strawberries in perfection, at his first 
meal, whilst seated, maybe, next to some dreamy- 
eyed hourly who coos soft nothings into his ear, 
at intervals. The wines of Italy go best with 
this sort of repast, which is generally eaten with 
" spoons." 



BREAKFAST %-j 

In fair France, breakfast, or the dejeuner a la 
fourchette^ is not served until noon, or thereabouts. 
CofFee or chocolate, with fancy bread and butter, 
is on hand as soon as you wake ; and I have 
heard that for the roysterer and the p't'it creve 
there be such liquors as cognac^ cura^oa^ and 
chartreuse verte provided at the first meal, so 
that nerves can be strung together and headaches 
alleviated before the " associated " breakfast at 
mid-day. In the country, at the chateau of 
Monsieur et Madame^ the groom-of-the-chambers, 
or maitre d'hotel^ as he is designated, knocks at 
your bedroom door at about 8.30. 

"Who's there?" 

" Good-morning, M^sieu. Will M^sieu partake 
of the chocolate or of the cafi-au-lait^ or of the 
tea ? " 

Upon ordinary occasions, M'*steu will partake of 
the chocolat — if he be of French extraction ; 
whilst the EngHsh visitor will partake of the 
cafe-au-latt — tea-making in France being still in 
its infancy. And if M^sieu has gazed too long on 
the wine of the country, overnight, he will occa- 
sionally — reprobate that he is — partake instead of 
the vieux cognac^ diluted from the syphon. And 
M^steu never sees his host or hostess till the 
" assembly " sounds for the mid-day meal. 

I have alluded, just above, to French tea- 
making. There was a time when tea, with our 
lively neighbours, was as scarce a commodity as 
snakes in Iceland or rum punch in Holloway 
Castle. Then the thin end of the wedge was 
introduced, and the English visitor was invited to 
partake of a cup of what was called (by courtesy) 



tg CAKES AND ALE 

M/, which had been concocted expressly for her 
or him. And tea a la Fran^aise used to be 
made somewhat after this fashion. The cup was 
half- filled with milk, sugar a discretion being 
added. A little silver sieve was next placed over the 
cup, and from a jug sufficient hot water, in which 
had been previously left to soak some half-dozen 
leaf-fragments of green tea, to fill the cup, was 
poured forth. In fact the visitor was invited to 
drink a very nasty compound indeed, something 
like the "wish" tea with which the school- 
mistress used to regale her victims — milk and 
water, and " wish-you-may-get " tea ! But they 
have changed all that across the Channel, and 
five o'clock tea is one of the most fashionable 
functions of the day, with the beau monde ; a 
favourite invitation of the society hel/e of the Jin de 
siecle being : " Voulez-vous fivoclocquer avec moi ? " 

The dejeuner usually begins with a consomme^ a 
thin, clear, soup, not quite adapted to stave ofi 
the pangs of hunger by itself, but grateful enough 
by way of a commencement. Then follows an 
array of dishes containing fish and fowl of sorts, 
with the inevitable cotelettes a la somebody-or- 
other, not forgetting an omelette — a mess which 
the French cook alone knows how to concoct to 
perfection. The meal is usually washed down 
with some sort of claret ; and a subsequent cafe^ 
with the accustomed chasse ; whilst the welcome 
cigarette is not " defended," even in the mansions 
of the great. 

There is more than one way of making coffee, 
that of the lodging-house " general," and of the 
street- stall dispenser^ during the small hours, 



BREAKFAST 29 

being amongst the least commendable. Without 
posing as an infallible manufacturer of the re- 
freshing (though indigestible, to many people) 
beverage, I would urge that it be made from 
freshly-roasted seed, ground just before wanted. 
Then heat the ground coffee in the oven, and 
place upon the perforated bottom of the upper 
compartment of a cafeture^ put the strainer on 
It, and pour in boiling water, gradually. " The 
Duke" in Genevieve de Brabant used to warble 
as part of a song in praise of tea — 

And 'tis also most important 

That you should not spare the tea. 

So is it of equal importance that you should 
not spare the coffee. There are more elaborate 
ways of making coffee ; but none that the writer 
has tried are in front of the old cafetiere^ if the 
simple directions given above be carried out in 
their entirety. 

As in France, sojourners (for their sins) jn 
the burning plains of Ind have their first break- 
fast, or diota hazri^ at an early hour, whilst the 
breakfast proper — usually described in Lower 
Bengal, Madras, and Bombay as " tiffin " — comf/S 
later on. For 

Chota Hazri 

(literally "little breakfast") — which is scii^ed 
either at the Mess-house, the public Bath, or in 
one's own bungalow, beneath the verandah — 
poached eggs on toast are de rtgueur^ whilst I have 
met such additions as unda ishcamble (scrambled 
eggs), potato cake, and (naughty, naughty ! ) 



30 CAKES AND ALE 

anchovy toast. Tea or coffee are always drunk 
with this meal. " Always," have I written ? 
Alas ! In my mind's eye I can see the poor 
Indian vainly trying to stop the too-free flow of 
the Belati pant (Hterally "Europe water") by 
thrusting a dusky thumb into the neck of the 
just-opened bottle, and in my mind's ear can I 
catch the blasphemous observation of the subaltern 
as he remarks to his slave that he does not require, 
in his morning's "livener," the additional flavour 
jf Mahommedan flesh, and the " hubble-bubble " 
pipe, the tobacco in which may have been 
stirred by the same thumb that morning. 

" CoflFee shop " is a favourite function, during 
the march of a regiment in India, at least it used 
to be in the olden time, before troops were 
conveyed by railway. Dhoolies (roughly made 
palanquins) laden with meat and drink were 
sent on half way, overnight ; and grateful indeed 
was the cup of tea, or coffee, or the " peg " 
which was poured forth for the weary warrior 
who had been "tramping it" or in the saddle 
since 2 a.m. or some such unearthly hour, in 
order that the column might reach the new 
camping-ground before the sun was high in the 
heavens. It was at "coffee-shop" that "chaff" 
reigned supreme, and speculations as to what the 
shooting would be like at the next place were 
indulged in. And when that shooting was likely 
to fake the form of long men, armed with long 
guns, and long knives, the viands, which con- 
sisted for the most part of toast, biscuits, poached 
eggs, and unda bakum (eggs and bacon), were 
devoured with appetites all the keener for the 



BREAKFAST 31 

prospect in view. It is in troublous times, be 
it further observed, that the Hindustan khit \z 
seen at his best. On the field of battle itself I 
have known cofFee and boiled eggs — or even a 
grilled fowl — produced by the fearless and devoted 
nokhur^ from, apparently, nowhere at all. 

At the Indian breakfast proper, all sorts ot 
viands are consumed j from the curried prawns 
and Europe provisions (which arrive in an her- 
metically sealed condition per s.s. Nomattawot)^ 
to the rooster who heralds your arrival at the 
dak bungalow, with much crowing, and who 
within half an hour of your advent has been 
successively chased into a corner, beheaded, 
plucked, and served up for your refection in a 
scorched state. I have breakfasted off such 
assorted food as curried locusts, boiled leg of 
mutton, fried snipe, Europe sausages. Iron ishtoo 
(Irish stew), vilolif{ve2\ olives, and more correctly 
a dinner dish), kidney toast — chopped sheep s 
kidneys, highly seasoned with pepper, lime-juice, 
and Worcester sauce, very appetising — parrot 
pie, eggs and bacon, omelette (which might also 
have been used to patch ammunition boots with), 
sardines, fried fish (mind the bones of the Asiatic 
fish), bifishtake (beef steak), goat chops, curries 
of all sorts, hashed venison, and roast peafowl, 
ditto quail, ditto pretty nearly everything that 
flies, cold buffalo hump, grilled sheep's tail (a 
bit bilious), hermetically -sealed herring, turtle 
fins, Guava jelly, preserved mango, home-made 
cake, and many other things which have escaped 
memory. I am coming to the " curry " part of 
the entertainment later on in the volume, but 



3a CAKES AND ALE 

may remark that it is preferable when eaten in 
the middle of the day. My own experience was 
that few people touched turry when served in 
its normal place at dinner — as a course of itself — 
just before the sweets. 

" Breakfast with my tutor ! " What happy 
memories of boyhood do not the words conjure 
up, of the usually stern, unbending preceptor 
pouring out the coffee, and helping the sausages 
and mashed potatoes — we always had what is 
now known as " saus and mash " at my tutor's — 
and the fatherly air with which he would remind 
the juvenile glutton, who had seated himself just 
opposite the apricot jam, and was improving the 
occasion, that eleven o'clock school would be in 
full swing in half an hour, and that the brain 
• and, by process of reasoning, the stomach) could 
not be in too good working-order for the fervid 
young student of Herodotus. The ordinary 
breakfast of the " lower boy " at Eton used to be 
of a very uncertain pattern. Indeed, what with 
"fagging," the preparation of his lord-and- 
master's breakfast, the preparation of " pupil- 
room " work, and agile and acute scouts ever on 
the alert to pilfer his roll and pat of butter, that 
boy was lucky if he got any breakfast at all. If 
he possessed capital, or credit, he might certainly 
stave off starvation at " Brown's," with buttered 
buns and pickled salmon ; or at " Webber's," or 
"the Wall," with three-cornered jam tarts, or 
a " strawberry mess " ; but Smith minor^ and 
Jones minimus as often as not, went breakfastless 
to second school. 

At the University, breakfast with " the Head " 



BREAKFAST 33 

or any other "Don" was a rather solemn function. 
The table well and plentifully laid, and the host 
hospitality itself, but occasionally, nay, frequently, 
occupied with other thoughts. A departed 
friend used to tell a story of a breakfast of this 
description. He was shaken warmly by the 
hand by his host, who afterwards lapsed into 
silence. My friend, to " force the running," 
ventured on the observation — 

"It's a remarkably fine morning, sir, is it 
not ? " 

No reply came. In fact, the great man*s 
thoughts were so preoccupied with Greek roots, 
and other defunct horrors, that he spoke not a 
word during breakfast. But when, an hour or 
so afterwards, the time came for his guest to take 
leave, the " Head " shook him by the hand 
warmly once more, and remarked abstractedly — 

"D'you know, Mr. Johnson, I don't think 
that was a particularly original remark of yours? " 



CHAPTER IV 

LUNCHEON 

" Tis a custom 
More honoured in the breach than the observance." 

Why lunch? — Sir Henry Thompson on overdoing it — The 
children's dinner — City lunches — Ye Olde Cheshyre Cheese 
— Doctor Johnson — Ye pudding — A great fall in food — 
A snipe pudding — Skirt, not rumpsteak — Lancashire hot 
pot— A Cape " brady." 

"'More honoured in the breach,' do you say, 
Mr. Author ? " I fancy I hear some reader in- 
quire. " Are these your sentiments ? Do you 
really mean them ? '* Well, perhaps, they ought 
to be qualified. Unless a man breakfast very 
early, and dine very late, he cannot do himself 
much good by eating a square meal at 1.30 or 
2.0 P.M. There can be no question but that 
v/hilst thousands of the Heges — despite soup- 
kitchens, workhouses, and gaols — perish of 
absolute starvation, as many of their more fortu- 
nate brethren perish, in the course of time, from 
gluttony, from falling down (sometimes literally) 
and worshipping the Belly-god. 



LUiNCHEON 



35 



Years ago Sir Henry Thompson observed to a 
friend of the writer's : 

" Most men who seek my advice are suffering 
under one of two great evils — eating too much 
good food, or drinking too much bad hquor ; and 
occasionally they suffer under both evils." 

"This luncheon," writes OHver Wendell 
Holmes, " is a very convenient affair ; it does 
not require any special dress ; it is informal j 
and can be light or heavy as one chooses." 

The American — the male American at all 
events — takes far more count of luncheon than 
of breakfast. 

But in many cases luncheon and early dinner 
are synonymous terms. Take the family 
luncheon, for instance, of the middle classes, 
where mother, governess, and little ones all 
assemble in front of the roast and boiled, at the 
principal meal of the day, and the more or less 
snowy tablecloth is duly anointed with gravy 
by "poor baby," in her high chair, and the 
youngest but one is slapped at intervals by his 
instructress, for using his knife for the peas — 
at the risk of enlarging his mouth — or for 
swallowing the stones of the cherries which 
have been dealt him, or her, from the tart. 
This is not the sort of meal for the male friend 
of the family to " drop in " at, if he value the 
lappels of his new frock-coat, and be given to 
blushing. For children have not only an evil 
habit of " pawing " the visitor with jammy 
fingers, ^ but occasionally narrate somewhat 
" risky " anecdotes. And a child's ideas of 
the Christian religion, nay, of the Creator 



36 CAKES AND ALE 

himself, are occasionally more quaint than 
reverent. 

"Ma, dear," once lisped a sweet little thing 
of six, " what doth God have for hith dinner ? " 

"S-sh-sh, my child!" replied the horrified 
mother, "you must not ask such dreadful 
questions. God doesn't want any dinner, re- 
member that." 

" Oh-h-h ! " continued the unabashed and 
dissatisfied enfant terrible. And, after a pause, 
" then I thuppose he hath an egg with hith tea." 

In a country-house, of course, but few of the 
male guests turn up at the domestic luncheon, 
being otherwise engaged in killing something, 
or in trying to kill something, or in that sport 
which is but partially understood out of Great 
Britain — the pursuit of an evil-savoured animal 
who is practically worthless to civilisation after 
his capture and death. 

It is in "the City" that vile man, perhaps, 
puts in his best work as an eater of luncheons. 
Some city men there be, of course — poor, 
wretched, half-starved clerks, whose state nobody 
ever seems to attempt to ameliorate — whose 
mid-day refections are not such as would have 
earned a meed of commendation from the late 
Vitellius, or from the late Colonel North. For 
said refections but seldom consist of more im- 
portant items than a thick slice of bread and a 
stale bloater ; or possibly a home-made sandwich 
of bread and Dutch cheese — the whole washed 
down with a tumbler of milk, or more often a 
tumbler of the fluid supplied by the New River 
Company. During the winter months a penny- 



LUNCHEON 37 

worth of roasted chestnuts supplies a filling, 
though indigestible meal to many a man 
whose employer is swilling turtle at Birch's or 
at the big house in Leadenhall Street, and 
who is compelled, by the exigencies of custom, 
to wear a decent black coat and some sort of 
tall hat when on his way to and from 
" business." 

But the more fortunate citizens — how do they 
" do themselves " at luncheon ? For some there 
is the cheap soup-house, or the chop-and-steak 
house reviled of Dickens, and but kittle changed 
since the time of the great novelist. Then, for 
the " gilt-edged " division there is 

Birch's, 

the little green house which, although now 
"run" by those eminent caterers, Messrs. Ring 
and Brymer, is still known by the name of the 
old Alderman who deserved so well of his 
fellow citizens, and who, whilst a cordon bleu of 
some celebrity, had also a pretty taste as a play- 
wright. The old house has not changed one 
jot, either in appearance, customs, or fare. At 
the little counter on the ground floor may be 
obtained the same cheesecakes, tartlets, baked 
custards, and calfVfoot jellies which delighted 
our grandfathers, and the same brand of Scottish 
whisky. Upstairs, in the soup-rooms, some of 
the tables are covered with damask tablecloths, 
whilst at others a small square of napery but 
partially obscures the view of the well-polished 
mahogany. 



ii CAKES AND ALE 

Turtle Soup 

is still served on silver plates, w^hilst the cheaper 
juices of the bullock, the calf, and the pea, 
"with the usual trimmings," repose temporarily 
on china or earthenware. Pates^ whether of 
oyster, lobster, chicken, or veal-and-ham, are still 
in favour with habitue and chance customer 
alike, and no wonder, for these are something 
like pates. The " filling " is kept hot like the 
soups, in huge stewpans, on the range, and when 
required is ladled out into a plate, and furnished 
with top and bottom crust — and such crust, 
flaky and light to a degree ; and how different 
to the confectioner's or railway-refreshment pate^ 
which, when an orifice be made in the covering 
v/ith a pickaxe, reveals nothing more appetising 
than what appear to be four small cubes of frost- 
bitten indiarubber, with a portion or two of 
candle end. 

A more advanced meal is served in Leadenhall 
Street, at 

« The Ship and Turtle^'' 

said to be the oldest tavern in London, and 
which has been more than once swept and 
garnished, and reformed altogether, since its 
establishment during the reign of King Richard 
II. But they could have known but little about 
the superior advantages offered by the turtle as 
a life-sustainer, in those days ; whereas at the 
present day some hundreds of the succulent 
reptiles die the death on the premises, within a 
month, in order that city companies, and stock- 
brokers, and merchants of sorts, and mining 



LUNCHEON 39 

millionaires, and bicycle makers, and other 
estimable people, may dine and lunch. 

Then there are the numerous clubs, not for- 
getting one almost at the very door of "The 
House," where the 2000 odd (some of them very 
odd) members are regaled on the fat of the land 
in general, and of the turtle in particular, day by 
day ; and that mammoth underground palace the 
" ralmerston," where any kind of banquet can be 
served up at a few minutes' notice, and where 
" special Greek dishes " are provided for the 
gamblers in wheat and other cereals, at the 
adjacent " Baltic." There be also other eating- 
houses, far too numerous to mention, but most 
of them worth a visit. 

A " filling " sort of luncheon is a portion of a 

Cheshire Cheese Pudding, 

A little way up a gloomy court on the north 
side of Fleet Street — a neighbourhood which 
reeks of printers' ink, bookmakers' "runners," 
tipsters, habitual borrowers of small pieces of 
silver, and that " warm " smell of burning paste 
and molten lead which indicates the " foundry " 
in a printing works — is situated this ancient 
hostelry. It is claimed for the "Cheese" that 
it was the tavern most frequented by Dr. 
Samuel Johnson. Mr. C. Redding, in his Fifty 
Tears' Recollections^ Literary and Personal,^ 
published in 1858, says: "I often dined at the 

" Cheshire Cheese^'* 

Johnson and his friends, I was informed, used to 
do the same, and I was told I should see indi- 



40 CAKES AND ALE 

viduals who had met them there. This I found 
to be correct. The company was more select 
than in later times, but there are Fleet Street 
tradesmen who well remembered both Johnson 
and Goldsmith in this place of entertainment." 

Few Americans who visit our metropolis go 
away without making a pilgrimage to this ancient 
hostelry, where, upstairs, " Doctor Johnson's 
Chair " is on view ; and many visitors carry 
away mementoes of the house, in the shape of 
pewter measures, the oaken platters upon which 
these are placed, and even samples of the long 
" churchwarden " pipes, smoked by habitues after 
their evening chops or steaks. 

Te Puddingy 

which is served on Wednesdays and Saturdays, 
at 1.30 and 6.0, is a formidable-looking object, 
and its savour reaches even into the uttermost 
parts of Great Grub Street. As large, more or 
less, as the dome of St. Paul's, that pudding is 
stuffed with steak, kidney, oysters, mushrooms, 
and larks. The irreverent call these last named 
sparrows, but we know better. This pudding 
takes [on dit) 17^ hours in the boiling, and the 
" bottom crust " would have delighted the hearts 
of Johnson, Boswell, and Co., in whose days the 
savoury dish was not. The writer once witnessed 
a catastrophe at the " Cheshire Cheese," com- 
pared to which the burning of Moscow or the 
bombardment of Alexandria were mere trifles. 
1.30 on Saturday afternoon had arrived, and the 
oaken benches in the refectory were filled to 
repletion with expectant pudding-eaters. Bur- 



LUNCHEON 41 

gesses of the City of London were there — good, 
"warm," round-bellied men, with ploughboys' 
appetites — and journalists, and advertising agents, 
and " resting " actors, and magistrates' clerks, and 
barristers from the Temple, and well-to-do 
tradesmen. Sherry and gin and bitters and other 
adventitious aids (?) to appetite had been done 
justice to, and the arrival of the "procession" 
— it takes three men and a boy to carry the pi}ce 
de resistance from the kitchen to the dining-room 
— was anxiously awaited. And then, of a sudden 
we heard a loud crash ! followed by a feminine 
shriek, and an unwhispered Saxon oath. " Tom" 
the waiter had slipped, released his hold, and the 
pudding had fallen downstairs ! It was a sight 
ever to be remembered — steak, larks, oysters, 
" delicious gravy," running in a torrent into 
Wine Office Court. The expectant diners 
(many of them lunchers) stood up and gazed 
upon the wreck of their hopes, and then filed, 
silently and sadly, outside. Such a catastrophe 
had not been known in Brainland since the 
Great Fire. 

Puddings of all sorts are, in fact, favourite 
autumn and winter luncheon dishes in London, 
and the man who can " come twice " at such a 
" dream " as the following, between the hours of 
one and three, can hardly be in devouring trim for 
his evening meal till very late. It is a 

Snipe Pudding, 

A tkin slice of beef-skirt,^ seasoned with pepper 

* In most recipes for puddings or pies, rump steak is given. 
But this is a mistake, as the tendency of that part of the ox is to

and salt, at the bottom ot the basin ; then three 
snipes beheaded and befooted, and with gizzards 
extracted. Leave the liver and heart in, an you 
value your life. Cover up with paste, and boil (or 
steam) for two-and-a-half hours. For stockbrokers 
and bookmakers, mushrooms and truffles are some- 
times placed within this pudding ; but it is better 
without — according to the writer's notion. 

Most of the fowls of the air may be treated in 
the same way. And when eating cold grouse for 
luncheon try (if you can get it) a fruit salad 
therewith. You will find preserved peaches, 
apricots, and cherries in syrup, harmonise well 
with cold brown game. 

Lancashire Hot- Pot 

is a savoury dish indeed ; but I know of but one 
eating-house in London where you can get 
anything like it. Here is the recipe — 

Place a layer of mutton cutlets, with most of the 
fat and tails trimmed off, at the bottom of a deep 
earthenware stewpan. Then a layer of chopped 
sheep's kidneys, an onion cut into thin slices, half- 
a-dozen oysters, and some sliced potatoes. Sprinkle 
over these a little salt and pepper and a teaspoonful 
of curry powder. Then start again with cutlets, and 
keep on adding layers of the different ingredients until 
the dish be full. Whole potatoes atop of all, and 
pour in the oyster liquor and some good gravy.

Besides the skirt — the thick skirt — there be tit-bits to be cut from 
around the shoulder. 



LUNCHEON 45 

Not too fierce an oven, just fierce enough to brown 
the top potatoes. 

In making this succulent concoction you can 
add to, or substitute for, the mutton cutlets 
pretty nearly any sort of flesh or fowl. I have 
met rabbit, goose, larks, turkey, and (frequently) 
beef therein ; but, believe me, the simple, 
harmless, necessary, toothsome cutlet makes the 
best lining. 

In the Cape Colony, and even as high up as 
Rhodesia, I have met with a dish called a Brady^ 
which is worthy of mention here. It is made in 
the same way as the familiar Irish stew; but 
instead of potatoes tomatoes are used.

LUNCHEON — (continued)

Shooting luncheons — Cold tea and a crust — Clear turtle — Such 
larks ! — ^Jugged duck and oysters — Woodcock pie — Hunt- 
ing luncheons — Pie crusts — The true Yorkshire pie — Race-

There is no meal which has become more 
" expanded " than a shooting luncheon. A crust 
of bread with cheese, or a few biscuits, and a 
flask of sherry sufliced for our forebears, who, de- 
spite inferior weapons and ammunition, managed 
to "bring 'em down " quite as effectually as do 
the shootists of this period. Most certainly and 
decidedly, a heavy luncheon is a mistake if you 
want to " shoot clean " afterwards. And bear this 
in mind, all ye " Johnnies " who rail at your 
host's champagne and turtle, after luncheon, in a 
comfortable pavilion in the midst of a pheasant 
battue^ and whose very beaters would turn up 



LUNCHEON 



45 



their noses at a pork pie and a glass of old ale, 
that there is nothing so good to shoot upon as 
cold tea, unless it be cold cofFee. I have tried 
both, and for a shooting luncheon par excellence 
commend me to a crust and a pint of cold tea, 
eaten whilst sitting beneath the shelter of an 
unpleached hedge, against the formal spread which 
commences with a consomme^ and finishes with 
guinea peaches, and liqueurs of rare cura^oa. 
Of course, it is assumed that the shooter wishes 
to make a bag. 

But as, fortunately for trade, everybody does 
not share my views, it will be as well to append 
a few dishes suitable to a scratch meal of this sort. 

First of all let it be said that a 

Roast Loin of Pork^ 

washed down with sweet champagne, is not 
altogether to be commended. I have nothing to 
urge against roast pork, on ordinary occasions, or 
champagne either ; but a woodcock takes a lot of 
hitting. 

Such a pudding as was sketched in the 
preceding chapter is allowable, as is also the 
Lancashire Hot-Pot. 

Shepherd's Pie^ 

i.e. minced meat beneath a mattress of mashed 
potatoes, with lots of gravy in the dish, baked, is 
an economical dish, but a tasty one ; and I have 
never known much left for the beaters. Rabbit 
Pie, or Pudding, will stop a gap most eiFectually, 
and 



+6 CAKES AND ALE 

Plover Pudding 

— the very name brings water to the lips — is 
entitled to the highest commendation. 

This is the favourite dish at the shooting 
luncheons of a u^ell- known Royal Duke, and 
when upon one occasion the discovery was made 
that through some misunderstanding said pud- 
ding had been devoured to the very bones, by the 
loaders^ the — well, "the band played," as they 
say out West. And a stirring tune did that 
band play too. 

Such Larks / 

Stuff a dozen larks with a forcemeat made from 
their own livers chopped, a little shallot, parsley, 
yolk of egg, salt, bread crumbs, and one green chili 
chopped and divided amongst the twelve. Brown in 
a stewpan, and then stew gently in a good gravy to 
which has been added a glass of burgundy. 

This is a plat fit for an emperor, and there will 
be no subsequent danger of his hitting a beater 
or a dog. Another dainty of home invention is 

yugged Duck with Oysters. 

Cut the fleshy parts of your waddler into neat 
joints, and having browned them place in a jar with 
nine oysters and some good gravy partly made from 
the giblets. Close the mouth of the jar, and stand 
it in boiling water for rather more than an hour. 
Add the strained liquor of the oysters and a little 
more gravy, and turn the concoction into a deep 
silver dish with a spirit lamp beneath. Wild duck 
can be jugged in the same way, but without the 
addition of the bivalves ; and a mixture of port wine 



LUNCHEON 47 

and Worcester sauce should be poured in, with a 
squeeze of lemon juice and cayenne, just before 
serving. 

Another dish which will be round "grateful 
and comforting " is an old grouse — the older the 
tastier. StufF him with a Spanish onion, add a 
little gravy and seasoning, and stew him till the 
flesh leaves the bones. All these stews, or 
"jugs" should be served on dishes kept hot by 
lighted spirit beneath them. This is most 
important. 

A Woodcock Pie 

will be found extremely palatable at any shoot- 
ing luncheon, although more freq^uently to be 
met with on the sideboards of the great and 
wealthy. In fact, at Christmas time, 'tis a pie 
which is specially concocted in the royal kitchen 
at Windsor Castle, to adorn Her Most Gracious 
Majesty's board at Osborne, together with the 
time-honoured baron of specially fed beef. This 
last named joint hardly meets my views as part 
of a breakfast menu; but here is the recipe for 
the woodcock pie. 

Bone four woodcocks — 1 don't mean take them 
off the hooks when the gentleman is not in his shop, 
but tell your cook to take the bones out of one 
you've shot yourself — put bones and trimmings into 
a saucepan with one shallot, one small onion, and a 
sprig of thyme, cover them with some good stock, 
and let this gravy simmer awhile. Take the giz- 
zards away from the heart and liver, pound, and mix 
these with some good veal forcemeat. Place the 
woodcocks, skin downwards, on a board ; spread over 



48 CAKES AND ALE 

each two layers of forcemeat, with a layer of sliced 
truffles in between the two. Make your crust, 
either in a mould, or with the hands, put a layer of 
forcemeat at the bottom, then two woodcocks, then 
a layer of truffles, then the other two woodcocks, 
another layer of truffles, and a top layer of force- 
meat, and some thin slices of fat bacon. Cover the 
pie, leaving a hole for the gravy, and bake in a 
moderate oven. After taking out pour in the 
gravy, then close the orifice and let the pie get cold 
before serving. 

N.B. — It will stimulate the digging industry if one 
or two whole truffles have been hidden away in the 
recesses of the pie. 

Another good pie I have met with — in the 
north country — was lined with portions of 
grouse and black game (no bones), with here 
and there half a hard-boiled egg. Nothing else 
except the necessary seasoning. 

With regard to 

Hunting Luncheons 

it cannot be said that your Nimrod is nearly as 
well catered for as is the "Gun." For, as a 
rule, the first-named, if he be really keen on the 
sport of kings has to content himself, during the 
interval of a "check," with the contents of a 
sandwich-case, and a flask, which may contain 
either brown sherry or brandy and water — or 
possibly something still more seductive. I have 
heard of flasks which held milk punch, but the 
experience is by no means a familiar one. If 
your Nimrod be given to " macadamisins;," 
instead of riding; the line, or if he sicken of the 



LUNCHEON 49 

business altogether before hounds throw off, he 
can usually " cadge " a lunch at some house in 
the neighbourhood, even though it may only 
"run to" bread and cheese — or, possibly, a 
wedge of a home-made pork-pie -with a glass, 
or mug, of nut brown ale. Not that all ale is 
"nut brown," but *tis an epithet which likes 
me well. Would it were possible to give practical 
hints here as to the true way to manufacture a 
pork-pie ! To make the attempt would, I fear, 
only serve to invite disaster ; for the art of 
pork-pie making, like that of the poet, or the 
playactor, should be born within us. In large 
households in the midland counties (wherein 
doth flourish the pig tart) there is, as a rule, but 
one qualified pie-maker — who is incapable of any 
other culinary feat whatever. I have even been 
told that it requires " special hands " to make 
the crust of the proper consistency ; and having 
tasted crusts and crusts, I can impHcitly believe 
this statement. Here is a recipe for a veritable 
savoury 

Tor k shire Pie, 

Bone a goose and a large fowl. Fill the latter 
with the following stuffing : — minced ham, veal, 
suet, onion, sweet herbs, lemon peel, mixed spices, 
goose-liver, cayenne, and salt, worked into a paste 
with the yolks oJf two eggs. Sew up the fowl, truss 
it, and stew it with the goose for twenty minutes in 
some good beef and giblet stock, with a small glass 
of sherry, in a close stewpan. Then put the fowl 
inside the goose, and place the goose within a pic- 
mould which has been lined with good hot-water 
paste. Let the goose rest on a cushion of stuffing, 



50 CAKES AND ALE 

and in the middle of the liquor in which he has 
been stewed. Surround him in the pie with slices 
of parboiled tongue and chunks of semi-cooked 
pheasant, partridge, and hare, filling in the vacancies 
with more stuffing, put a layer of butter atop, roof 
in the pie with paste, bake for three hours, and eat 
either hot or cold — the latter for choice. 

For a skating luncheon 

Irish Stew 

is the recognised entree^ served in soup-plates, 
and washed down with hot spiced ale. 
In the way of 

Race-course Luncheons 

our caterers have made giant strides in the last 
dozen years. A member of a large firm once 
told me that it was " out of the question " to 
supply joints, chops, and steaks in the dining- 
rooms of a grand stand, distant far from his base 
of operations, London. "Impossible, my dear 
sir ! we couldn't do it without incurring a 
ruinous loss." But the whirHgig of time has 
proved this feat to be not only possible, but one 
which has led to the best results for all concerned. 
In the matter of chops and steaks I hope to see 
further reforms introduced. These succulent 
dainties, it cannot be too widely known, are not 
at their best unless cut fresh from loin or rump, 
just before being placed on the gridiron. The 
longer a cut chop (raw) is kept the more of its 
virtue is lost. It might, possibly, cause a little 
extra delay, and a little extra expense, to send 



LUNCHEON 51 

ofF loins and rumps from the butcher's shop, 
instead of ready-cut portions, but the experiment 
would answer, in the long run. The same rule, 
of course, should apply to restaurants and grill- 
rooms all over the world. 

During the autumn and winter months, 
racecourse caterers seem to have but one 
idea of warm comforting food for their 
customers, and the name of that idea is Irish 
stew. This is no doubt an appetising dish, 
but might be varied occasionally for the 
benefit of the habitual follower of the sport 
of kings. Why not pea-soup, jugged hare 
(hares are cheap enough), hotpot, Scotch broth, 
mullagatawny, hotch-potch, stewed or curried 
rabbit, with rice, shepherd's pie, haricot oxtails, 
sheep's head broth (Scotch fashion), and hare 
soup ! What is the matter with the world- 
renowned stew of which we read in The Old 
Curiosity Shop — the supper provided by the land- 
lord of the "Jolly Sandboys " for the itinerant 
showmen ? Here it is again : 

" * It's a stew of tripe,' said the landlord, smack- 
ing his lips, * and cowheel,' smacking them again, 
* and bacon,' smacking them once more, * and 
steak,' smacking them for the fourth time, *and 
peas, cauliflowers, new potatoes, and sparrowgrass, 
all working up together in one delicious gravy.' 
Having come to the climax, he smacked his lips a 
great many times, and taking a long hearty sniff of 
the fragrance that was hovering about, put on the 
cover again with the air of one whose toils on earth 
were over. 

" ' At what time will it be ready ? ' asked Mr. 



5« CAKES AND ALE 

Codlin faintly. * It'll be done to a turn,' said the 
landlord, looking up at the clock, * at twenty-two 
minutes before eleven.' 

"*Then,' said Mr. Codlin, 'fetch me a pint of 
warm ale, and don't let nobody bring into the room 
even so much as a biscuit till the time arrives.' " 

And I do vow and protest that the above 
passage has caused much more smacking of lips 
than the most expensive, savoury menu ever 
thought out. True, sparrowgrass and new 
potatoes, and any peas but dried or tinned ones 
are not as a rule at their best in the same season 
as tripe ; but why not dried peas, and old potatoes, 
and rice, and curry powder, and onions — Charles 
Dickens forgot the onions — with, maybe, a 
modicum of old ale added, for " body " — in this 
stew, on a cold day at Sandown or Kempton ? 
Toujours Irish stew, like toujours mother-in-law, 
is apt to pall upon the palate ; especially if not 
fresh made. And frost occasionally interferes 
with the best-laid plans of a race-course caterer. 

" I don't mind a postponed meeting," once 
observed one of the " readiest " of bookmakers ; 
" but what I cannot stand is postponed Irish stew." 

Than a good bowl of 

Scotch Broth^ 

what could be more grateful, or less expensive ? 

Shin of beef, pearl barley, cabbages, leeks, tur- 
nips, carrots, dried peas (of course soaked overnight), 
and water — "all working up together in one de- 
licious gravy." 

Also 



LUNCHEON 53 

Hotch Potch, 

With the addition of cutlets from the best 
end of a neck of mutton, the same recipe as the 
above will serve for this dish, w^hich it must be 
remembered should be more of a " stodge " than 
a broth. 

There are more ways than one of making a 
" hot-pot." The recipe given above would hardly 
suit the views of any caterer who wishes to make 
a living for himself ; but it can be done on the 
cheap. The old lady whose dying husband was 
ordered by the doctor oysters and champagne, 
procured whelks and ginger beer for the patient, 
instead, on the score of economy. Then why 
not make your hot-pot with mussels instead of 
oysters ? Or why add any sort of mollusc ? In 
the certain knowledge that these be invaluable 
hints to race-course caterers, I offer them with all 
consideration and respect. 

The writer well remembers the time when the 
refreshments on Newmarket Heath at race-time 
were dispensed from a booth, which stood almost 
adjoining the " Birdcage." Said refreshments 
were rough, but satisfying, and consisted of thick 
sandwiches, cheese, and bread, with "thumb- 
pieces " (or " thumbers " ) of beef, mutton, and 
pork, which the luncher was privileged to cut 
with his own clasp-knife. Said "thumbers" 
seem to have gone out of favour with the 
aristocracy of the Turf; but the true racing 
or coursing sandwich still forms part of the 
impedimenta of many a cash - bookmaker, of his 
clerk, and of many a "Httle" backer. 'Tis a 



54 CAKES AND ALE 

solid, satisfying sandwich, and is just the sort 
of nourishment for a hard worker on a bitter 
November day. Let your steak be grilling, 
whilst you are enjoying your breakfast — some 
prefer the ox- portion fried, for these simple 
speculators have strange tastes — then take the 
steak ofF the fire and place it, all hot, between 
two thick slices of bread. The sandwich will 
require several paper wrappings, if you value the 
purity of your pocket-linings. And when eaten 
cold, the juices of the meat will be found to 
have irrigated the bread, with more or less 
" delicious gravy." And, as Sam Weller ought 
to have said, " it*s the gravy as does it." 

" But what about the swells ? " I fancy I 
hear somebody asking, " Is my Lord Tomnoddy, 
or the Duke of Earlswood to be compelled to 
satisfy his hunger, on a race-course, with tripe 
and fat bacon ? Are you really advising those 
dapper-looking, tailor-made ladies on yonder drag 
to insert their delicate teeth in a sandwich which 
would have puzzled Gargantua to masticate ? " 
Not at all, my good sir, or madam. The well- 
appointed coach should be well-appointed within 
and without. Of course the luncheon it contains 
will differ materially according to the season of 
the year. This is the sort of meal I will provide, 
an you will deign to visit the Arabian tent 
behind my coach, at Ascot : 

Lobster mayonnaise, salmon cutlets with 
Tartar sauce [iced\ curried prawns [iced)^ lobster 
cutlets, chaud-froid of quails, foie gras in aspic, 
prawns in ditto, plovers* eggs in ditto, galantine 
of chicken, York ham, sweets various, including 



LUNCHEON 55 

iced gooseberry fool j and, as the piece de re- 
sistance^ an 

AngeVs Pie, 

Many people would call this a pigeon pie, for in 
good sooth there be pigeons in it ; but 'tis a pie 
worthy of a brighter sphere than this. 

Six plump young pigeons, trimmed ot all super- 
fluous matter, including pinions and below the 
thighs. Season with pepper and salt, and stuff these 
pigeons with foie gras, and quartered truffles, and 
fill up the pie with plovers' eggs and some good 
force-meat. Make a good gravy from the super- 
fluous parts of the birds, and some calf's head stock 
to which has been added about half a wine-glassful 
of old Madeira, with some lemon-juice and cayenne. 
See that your paste be light and flaky, and bake in 
a moderate oven for three hours. Pour in more 
gravy just before taking out, and let the pie get 
cold. 

This is a concoction which will make you 
back all the winners j whilst no heiress who 
nibbles at it would refuse you her hand and 
heart afterwards. 

This is another sort of 

Pigeon Pie 

which is best served hot, and is more suited to 
the dining-room than the race-course. 

Line a pie dish with veal force-meat, very highly 
seasoned, about an inch thick. Place on it some 
thin slices of tat bacon, three Bordeaux pigeons 
(trimmed) in halves, a veal sweetbread in slices, an 



56 CAKES AND ALE 

ox palate, boiled and cut up into dice, a dozen 
asparagus tops, a few button mushrooms (the large 
ones would give the interior of the pie a bad colour) 
and the yolks of four eggs. Cover with force-meat, 
and bake for three hours. Some good veal gravy- 
should be served with this, which I have named 

Suffolk Pride, 

It is a remarkable fact in natural history that 
English pigeons are at their best just at the 
time when the young rooks leave the shelter of 
their nests. Therefore have I written, in the 
above recipe, " Bordeaux " pigeons. 

Here is a quaint old eighteenth-century recipe, 
which comes from Northumberland, and is given 
verbatim^ for a 

Goose Pie. 

Bone a goose, a turkey, a hare, and a brace of 
grouse ; skin it, and cut oft all the outside pieces — 
I mean of the tongue, after boiling it — lay the goose, 
for the outside a few pieces of hare ; then lay in the 
turkey, the grouse, and the remainder of the tongue 
and hare. Season highly between each layer with 
pepper and salt, mace and cayenne, and put it 
together, and draw it close with a needle and thread. 
Take 20 lbs. of flour, put 5 lbs. of butter into a 
pan with some water, let it boil, pour it among the 
flour, stir it with a knife, then work it with your 
hands till quite stiff. Let it stand before the fire 
for half an hour, then raise your pie and set it to 
cool ; then finish it, put in the meat, close the pie, 
and set it in a cold place. Ornament according 
to your taste, bandage it with calico dipped in fat. 
Let it stand all night before baking. It will take a 
long time to bake. The oven must be pretty hot 



LUNCHEON 57 

for the first four hours, and then allowed to slacken. 
To know when it is enough, raise one of the orna- 
ments, and with a fork try if the meat is tender. 
If it is hard the pie must be put in again for two 
hours more. After it comes out of the oven fill up 
with strong stock, well seasoned, or with clarified 
butter. All standing pies made in this way. 

Verily, in the eighteenth century they must 
have had considerably more surplus cash and 
time, and rather more angelic cooks than their 
descendants ! 

During cold weather the interior of the coach 
should be well filled with earthenware vessels 
containing such provender as hot-pot, hare soup, 
mullagatawney, lobster a V America ine^ curried 
rabbit, devilled larks — with thew^^/nV/ for heating 
these. Such cold viands as game pie, pressed 
beef, boar's hta.dy /oie gras (truffled), plain truffles 
(to be steamed and served with buttered toast) 
anchovies, etc. The larks should be smothered 
with a paste made from a mixture of mustard, 
Chili vinegar, and a little anchovy paste, and kept 
closely covered up. After heating, add cayenne 
to taste. 

Gourmets interested in menus may like to 
know what were the first dejeuners partaken of by 
the Tsar on his arrival in Paris in October 1869. 

On the first day he had huitres, consomme, 
ceufs a la Parisienne, filet de boeuf, pommes de 
terre, Nesselrode sauce, chocolat. 

Next day he ate huitres, consomme, oeufs 
Dauphine, rougets, noisettes d'agneau marechal, 
pommes de terre, cailles a la Bohemienne, 
poires Bar-Ie-Duc.

The writer can recall some colossal luncheons 
partaken of at dear, naughty Simla, in the long 
ago, when a hill station in India was, if anything, 
livelier than at the present day, and furnished plenty 
of food for both mind and body. Our host was 
the genial proprietor of a weekly journal, to 
which most of his guests contributed, after their 
lights ; " sport and the drama " falling to the 
present writer's share. Most of the food at 
those luncheons had been specially imported from 
Europe ; and although the whitebait tasted more 
of the hermetical sealing than of the Thames 
mud, most of the other items were succulent 
enough. There were turtle soup, and turtle fins ; 
highly seasoned pates of sorts ; and the native 
khansama had added several dishes of his own 
providing and invention. A young florican 
(bustard) is by no means a bad bird, well roasted 
and basted ; and though the eternal vilolif (veal 
olives) were usually sent away untasted, his snipe 
puddings were excellent. What was called 
picheese (twenty-five years old) brandy, from the 
atelier of Messrs. Justerini and Brooks, was served 
after the coffee j and those luncheon parties seldom 
broke up until it was time to dress for dinner. 
In fact, our memories were not often keen as 
to anything which occurred after the coffee, 
and many *^' strange things happened " in con- 
sequence ; although as they have no particular 
connection with high -class cookery, they need 
not be alluded to in this chapter. 

But, as observed before, 1 am of opinion that 
luncheon, except under certain circumstances, is 
a mistake. 



CHAPTER VI 



DINNER 

** Some hae meat and canna eat, 
And some wad eat that want it j 
But we can eat and we hae meat, 
And sae the Lord be thankit." 

Origin — Early dinners — The noble Romans — "VitelHus the 
Glutton" — Origin of haggis — The Saxons — Highland hospi- 
tality — The French invasion — Waterloo avenged — The bad 
fairy "yf/a" — Comparisons — The English cook or the foreign 
food torturer ? — Plain or flowery — Fresh fish and the flavour 
wrapped up — George Augustus Sala — Doctor Johnson again. 

It is somewhat humiliating to reflect that wc 
Britons owe the art of dining to our first con- 
querors the Romans — a smooth-faced race of 
voluptuaries whose idea of a bonne bouche took 
the form of a dormouse stewed in honey and 
sprinkled with poppy-seed. But it was not 
until the Normans had fairly established them- 
selves and their cookery, that the sturdy Saxon 
submitted himself to be educated by the foreign 
food-spoiler ; and at a later period the frequent 
invasions of France by Britain — when money 
was " tight " in the little island — were un- 
F 



6o CAKES AND ALE 

doubtedly responsible for the commencement 
of the system of " decorating " food which so 
largely obtains to-day. 

The name "dinner" is said — although it 
seems incredible that words should have become 
so corrupted — to be a corruption of dix heures^ 
the time at which (a.m.), in the old Norman 
days, the meal was usually partaken of j and the 
time at which (p.m.), in later years, when none of 
the guests ever knew the hour, in that loose-and- 
careless period, the meal was occasionally par- 
taken of at Limmer's and at Lane's, in London 
town. Froissart, in one of his works, mentions 
having waited upon the Duke of Lancaster at 
5 P.M., " after his Grace had supped " ; and it is 
certain that during the reigns of Francis L and 
Louis XIL of France, the world of fashion was 
accustomed to dine long before the sun had 
arrived at the meridian, and to sup at what we 
now call "afternoon tea time." Louis XIV. 
did not dine till twelve ; and his contemporaries, 
Oliver Cromwell and the Merry Monarch, sat 
down to the principal meal at one. In 1700, 
two was the fashionable time; and in 1751 we 
read that the Duchess of Somerset's hour for 
dinner was three. The hour for putting the 
soup on the table kept on advancing, until, after 
Waterloo, it became almost a penal offence to 
dine before six ; and so to the end of the century, 
when we sit down to a sumptuous repast at a 
time when farm -labourers and artisans are either 
snug between the blankets, or engaged in their 
final wrangle at the "Blue Pig." 

The Romans in the time of Cicero had a 



DINNER 61 

light breakfast at 3.30 a.m., lunched at noon, 
and attacked the coena at periods varying between 
3 and 7 P.M. — according to the season of the 
year. They commenced the first course with 
eggs, and each noble Roman was supposed to 
clear his palate with an apple at the conclusion 
of the third course. "A banquet with Vitellius," 
we read, "was no light and simple repast. 
Leagues of sea and miles of forest had been swept 
to furnish the mere groundwork of the entertain- 
ment. Hardy fishermen had spent their nights 
on the heaving wave, that the giant turbot might 
flap its snowy flakes on the Emperor's table, 
broader than its broad dish of gold. Many a 
swelling hill, clad in the dark oak coppice, had 
echoed to ringing shout of hunter and deep- 
mouthed bay of hound, ere the wild boar yielded 
his grim life, by the morass, and the dark grisly 
carcase was drawn ofF to provide a standing dish 
that was only meant to gratify the eye. Even 
the peacock roasted in its feathers was too gross 
a dainty " — especially the feather part, we should 
think — "for epicures who studied the art of gastro- 
nomy under Caesar j and that taste would have 
been considered rustic in the extreme which 
could partake of more than the mere fumes and 
savour of so substantial a dish. A thousand 
nightingales had been trapped and killed, indeed, 
for this one supper, but brains and tongues were 
all they contributed to the banquet ; while even 
the wing of a roasted hare would have been 
considered far too coarse and common food for 
the imperial table." Talk about a beanfeast I 
According to Suetonius (whose name suggests 



62 Cakes and ale 

"dufF") the villain Nero was accustomed to dine 
in a superb apartment, surrounded with mechani- 
cal scenery, which could be " shifted " with 
every course. The suppers of "Vitellius the 
Glutton " cost, on the average, more than ^^4000 
a-piece — which reads like a " Kaffir Circus " 
dinner at the Savoy — and the celebrated feast to 
which he invited his brother was down in the 
bill for ^40,350. Now a-nights we don't spend 
as much on a dinner, even when we invite other 
people's wives. " It consisted " — I always think 
of Little Dombey and the dinner at Doctor 
Blimber's, on reading these facts — "of two 
thousand different dishes of fish, and seven 
thousand of fowls, with other equally numerous 
meats." 

" Sharp - biting salads," salted herrings, and 
pickled anchovies, were served, as hors d'oeuvres 
during the first course of a Roman banquet, to 
stimulate the hunger which the rest of the meal 
would satisfy ; but although Vitellius was, 
according to history, " a whale on " oysters, they 
do not appear to have been eaten as a whet to 
appetite. And it was the duty of one, or more, 
of the Emperor's " freedmen " to taste every dish 
before his imperial master, in case poison might 
lurk therein. A garland of flowers around the 
brows was the regular wear for a guest at a 
"swagger" dinner party in ancient Rome-, and, 
the eating part over, said garland was usually 
tilted back on the head, the while he who had 
dined disposed himself in an easy attitude on his 
ivory couch, and proffered his cup to be filled 
by the solicitous slave. Then commenced the 



DINNER 63 

" big drink." But it must be remembered that 
although the subsequent display of fireworks was 
provided from lively Early Christians, in tar 
overcoats; these Romans drank the pure, un- 
adulterated juice of the grape, freely mixed with 
water ; so that headaches i' th' morn were not 
de rigueur^ nor did the subsequent massacres and 
other diversions in the Amphitheatre cause any 
feeHngs of "jumpiness." 

The Roman bill-of-fare, however, does not 
commend itself to all British epicures, one of 
whom wrote, in a convivial song — 

" Old Lucullus, they say. 
Forty cooks had each day. 

And Vitellius's meals cost a million j 
But I like what is good, 
When or where be my food, 

In a chop-house or royal pavilion. 

At all feasts (if enough) 

I most heartily stuff. 
And a song at my heart alike rushes. 

Though I've not fed my lungs 

Upon nightingales* tongues, 
Nor the brains of goldfinches and thrushes.** 

My pen loves to linger long over the gastro- 
nomies of those shaven voluptuaries, the ancient 
Italians ; and my Caledonian readers will forgive 
the old tales when it is further set forth that the 
Romans introduced, amongst other things, 

Haggis 

into Bonnie Scotland. Yes, the poet*s "great 
chieftain o' the puddin' race " is but an Italian 



<4 CAKES AND ALE 

dish after all. The Apician pork haggis ^ was a 
boiled pig's stomach filled with fry and brains, 
raw eggs, and pine apples beaten to a pulp, and 
seasoned with liquamen. For although some of 
the Romans* tastes savoured of refinement, many 
of them were " absolutely beastly." The idea of 
pig's fry and pineapples mixed is horrible enough ; 
but take a look into the constitution ef this 
liquamen^ and wonder no longer that Gibbons 
wrote his Decline and Fall with so much feeling 
and gusto. This sauce was obtained from the 
intestines, gills, and blood of fishes, great and 
small, stirred together with salt, and exposed in 
an open vat in the sun, until the compound 
became putrid. When putrefaction had done 
its work, wine and spices were added to the 
hell-broth, which was subsequently strained and 
sent into the Roman market. This liquamen 
was manufactured in Greece, and not one of all 
the poets of sunny Italy seems to have satirised 
the " made-in-Greece " custom, which in those 
days must have been almost as obnoxious as the 
"made -in -Germany" or the " made-in- White- 
chapel " scare of to-day. 

The usual farinaceous ingredient of the 
Roman haggis was frumenty, but frequently 
no grain whatever was applied ; and instead 

^ The cannie Scot, however, never made his haggis from any- 
thing belonging to the pij. The dislike of the Scots to pork 
dates from very long ago, as we read in a note to Sir Walter 
Scott's JVaverley. King "Jamie" carried this prejudiceto England, 
an<i is known to have abhorred perk almost as much as he did 
tobacco. His proposed banquet to the " Deil " consisted of a 
loin of pork, a poll (or head) of ling, with a pipe of tobacco for 
digestion. 



DINNER 65 

of mincing the ingredients, as do the Scots, 
the ancients pounded them in a mortar, well 
moistened with liquamen^ until reduced to pulp. 
We are further told in history that a Roman 
gladiator was capable, after playing with eggs, 
fish, nightingales' tongues, dormice, and haggis, 
of finishing a wild boar at a sitting. But as 
the old lady remarked of the great tragedy, this 
happened a long time ago, so let's hope it isn't 
true. 

The Saxon dining -table was oblong, and 
rounded at the ends. The cloth was crimson, 
with broad gilt edgings hanging low beneath 
the table, and, it is to be feared, often soiled by 
the dirty boots of the guests, who sat on chairs 
with covered backs, the counterfeit presentments 
of which are still to be seen in the Tottenham 
Court Road. The food consisted of fish, fowls, 
beef, mutton, venison, and pork — wild and 
domestic — either boiled, baked, or broiled, and 
handed to the company by the attendants on 
small spies, A favourite " fish joint " of the old 
Saxon was a cut out of the middle of a porpoise ; 
and bread of the finest wheaten flour reposed in 
two silver baskets at each end of the table, above 
the salt, the retainers having to content them- 
selves with coarser " household " out of a wooden 
cradle. Almost the only vegetable in use amongst 
the Saxons was kalewort, although the Romans 
had brought over many others, years before ; 
but hatred of anything foreign was more 
rampant in early Saxon days than at present. 
Forks were not introduced into England until 
during the reign of King "Jamie" : so that our 



66 CAKES AND ALE 

ancestors had perforce to " thumb " their victuals. 
The fair Queen Elizabeth (like much more 
modern monarchs) was accustomed to raise to 
her mouth with her virgin fingers a turkey leg 
and gnaw it. But even in the earliest days of 
the thirteenth century, each person was provided 
with a small silver basin and two flowered napkins 
of the finest linen, for finger-washing and wiping 
purposes. Grapes, figs, nuts, apples, pears, and 
almonds, constituted a Saxon dessert; and in 
the reign of Edward III. an Act of Parliament 
was passed, forbidding any man or woman to 
be served with more than two courses, unless on 
high days and holidays, when each was entitled 
to three. 

Here is the bill for the ingredients of a big dinner 
provided by a City Company in the fifteenth 
century : " Two loins of veal and two loins of 
mutton, IS. 4d. ; one loin of beef, ^d. ; one dozen 
pigeons and 12 rabbits, gd. ; one pig and one 
capon, IS. ; one goose and lOO eggs, is. oj^d. ; 
one leg of mutton, 2jd. ; two gallons of sack, 
IS. 4d. ; eight gallons of strong ale, is. 6d. ; 
total, 7s. 6d." Alas ! In these advanced days 
the goose alone would cost more than the 
" demmed total." 

Cedric the Saxon's dining table, described in 
Ivanho£y was of a much simpler description than 
the one noted above ; and the fare also. But 
there was no lack of assorted liquors — old wine 
and ale, good mead and cider, rich morat (a mixture 
of honey and mulberry juice, a somewhat gouty 
beverage, probably), and odoriferous pigment — 
which was composed of highly- spiced wine, 



DINNER 67 

sweetened with honey. The Virgin Queen, at 
a later epoch, was catered for more delicately ; 
and we read that she detested all coarse meats, 
evil smells, and strong wines. During the 
Georgian era coarse meats and strong wines 
were by no means out of favour ; and Highland 
banquets especially were Gargantuan feasts, to 
be read of with awe. The dinner given by 
Fergus Maclvor, in honour of Captain Waverley, 
consisted of dishes of fish and game, carefully 
dressed, at the upper end of the table, immediately 
under the eye of the English stranger. " Lower 
down stood immense clumsy joints of beef," says 
the gifted author, "which, but for the absence 
of pork, abhorred in the Highlands, resembled 
the rude festivity of the banquet of Penelope's 
suitors. But the central dish was a yearling lamb, 
called a "hog in har'st," roasted whole. It was 
set upon its legs, with a bunch of parsley in its 
mouth, and was probably exhibited in that form 
to gratify the pride of the cook, who piqued 
himself more on the plenty than the elegance 
of his master's table. The sides of this poor 
animal" — the lamb, not the cook, we suppose is 
meant — " were fiercely attacked by the clansmen, 
some with dirks, others with the knives worn in 
the same sheath as the dagger, so that it was 
soon rendered a mangled and rueful spectacle." 

A spectacle which reminds the writer of a 
dinner table at the Royal Military College, 
Sandhurst, in the early sixties. 

"Lower down," continues Sir Walter, "the 
victuals seemed of yet coarser quality, though 
sufficiently abundant. Broth, onions, cheese, and 



68 CAKES AND ALE 

the fragments of the feast, regaled the sons of 
Ivor, who feasted in the open air." 

The funeral baked meats used after the inter- 
ment of the chief of the Clan Quhele (described 
in The Fair Maid of Perth) were also on a very 
extensive scale, and were, like the other meal, 
" digested " with pailfuls of usquebaugh, for 
which no Highland head that supported a bonnet 
was ever " the waur i' th' morn." And the 
custom of placing bagpipers behind the chairs 
of the guests, after they have well drunk, 
which is still observed in Highland regiments, 
was probably introduced by the aforesaid 
Fergus Maclvor, who really ought to have 
known better. 

And so the years rolled on ; and at the com- 
mencement of the nineteenth century, old Eng- 
land, instead of enjoying the blessings of universal 
peace, such as the spread of the Gospel of Chris- 
tianity might have taught us to expect, found 
herself involved in rather more warfare than 
was good for trade, or anything else. The first 
" innings " of the Corsican usurper was a short 
but merry one ; the second saw him finally 
"stumped." And from that period dates the 
" avenging of Waterloo " which we have suffered 
in silence for so long. The immigration of 
aliens commenced, and in the tight little island 
were deposited a large assortment of the poison- 
ous seeds of alien cookery which had never 
exactly flourished before. The combat between 
the Roast Beef of old England and the bad fairy 
" Ala^^ with her attendant sprites Grease, Vinegar, 
and Garlic, commenced j a combat which at the 



DINNER 69 

end of the nineteenth century looked excessively 
like terminating in favour of the fairy. 

It has been repeatedly urged against my former 
gastronomic w^ritings that they are unjustly 
severe on French cookery ; that far greater 
minds than mine own have expressed unqualified 
approval thereof ; that I know absolutely nothing 
about the subject ; and that my avowed hatred 
of our lively neighbours and their works is so 
ferocious as to become ridiculous. These state- 
ments are not altogether fair to myself. I have 
no " avowed hatred " of our lively neighbours ; 
in fact, upon one occasion on returning from the 
celebration of the Grand Prix, I saw a vision of 

but that is a different anecdote. My lash 

has never embraced the entire batter ie de cuisine 
of the chef^ and there be many French plats 
which are agreeable to the palate, as long as we 
are satisfied that the materiel of which they are 
composed is sound, wholesome, and of the best 
quality. It is the cheap restaurateur who should 
be improved out of England. I was years ago 
inveigled into visiting the kitchen of one of these 

grease-and-garlic shops, and but the memory 

is too terrible for language. And will anybody 
advance the statement that a basin of the tortue 
claire of the average <:A^ deserves to be mentioned 
in the same breath with a plate of clear turtle at 
Birch's or Painter's ? or that good genuine 
English soup, whether ox-tail, mock-turtle, pea, 
oyster, or Palestine, is not to be preferred to the 
French puree^ or to their teakettle broth flavoured 
with carrots, cabbages, and onions, and dignified 
by the name of consomme F 



70 CAKES AND ALE 

Then let us tackle the subject of fish. Would 
you treat a salmon in the British way, or smother 
him with thick brown gravy, fried onions, garlic, 
mushrooms, inferior claret, oysters, sugar, pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, en Matelote^ or mince him fine 
to make a ridiculous mousse ? Similarly with the 
honest, manly sole ; would you fry or grill him 
plain, or bake him in a coat of rich white sauce, 
onion juice, mussel ditto, and white wine, or 
cider, a la Normande ; or cover him with toasted 
cheese a la Cardinal P 

The fairy ^^j^Ia" is likewise responsible for 
the clothing of purely English food in French 
disguises. Thus a leg of mutton becomes a 
gigoty a pheasant (for its transgressions in 
eating the poor farmer's barley) a faisan^ and is 
charged for at special rates in the bill ; whilst 
the nearest to a beefsteak our lively neighbours 
can get is a portion of beef with the fibre 
smashed by a wooden mallet, surmounted by an 
exceedingly bilious-looking compound like axle- 
grease, and called a Chateaubriand -, and curry 
becomes under the new regime^ hart. 

Undoubtedly, the principal reason for serving 
food smothered in made-gravies lies in the in- 
feriority of the food. Few judges will credit 
France with the possession of better butcher's- 
meat — with the exception of veal — than the 
perfidious island, which is so near in the matter 
of distance, and yet so far in the matter of 
custom. And it is an established fact that the 
fish of Paris is not as fresh as the fish of London. 
Hence the sole Normande^ the sole au gratin^ 
and the sole smothered in toasted cheese. But 



DINNER ^1 

when we islanders are charged at least four times 
as much for the inferior article, in its foreign 
cloak, as for the home article in its native 
majesty, I think the time has come to protest. 
It is possible to get an excellent dinner at any 
of the "Gordon" hotels, at the "Savoy," the 
^* Cecil," and at some other noted food-houses — 
more especially at Romano's — by paying a stiff 
price for it ; out it is due to a shameful lack of 
enterprise on the part of English caterers that a 
well-cooked English dinner is becoming more 
difficult to procure, year after year. There be 
three purely British dishes which are always "hoff" 
before all others on the programme of club, hotel, 
or eating-house j and these are, Irish stew, liver- 
and-bacon, and tripe-and-onions. Yet hardly a 
week passes without a new diner Paris ten 
making its appearance in the advertisement 
columns of the newspapers ; whilst the cheap- 
and-nasty table d'hote^ with its six or seven 
courses and its Spanish claret, has simply throttled 
the Roast Beef of Old England. 

"Sir," said Dr. Johnson, after examining a 
French menu^ " my brain is obfuscated after the 
perusal of this heterogeneous conglomeration of 
bastard English ill-spelt, and a foreign tongue. 
I prithee bid thy knaves bring me a dish of 
hog's puddings, a slice or two from the upper 
cut of a well-roasted sirloin, and two apple- 
dumplings." 

"William," said George Augustus Sala to 
the old waiter at the "Cheshire Cheese," "I've 
had nothing fit to eat for three months j get me 
a point steak, for God's sake ! " 



72 CAKES AND ALE 

The great lauder of foreign cookery had only 
that day returned from a special mission to France, 
to " write up " the works of the cordon bleu for 
the benefit of us benighted Englishmen. No 
man in the wide wide world knew so much, or 
could write so much, on the subject of and in 
praise of the fairy " Jla^^ as George Sala ; and 
probably no man in the wide wide world so little 
appreciated her efforts. 

But how has it come about that the fairy 
" Ala " has gained such headway in this island of 
ours ? The answer must commence another 
chapter. 



CHAPTER VII 
DINNER [continued) 

" It is the cause ! " 

Imitation — Dear Lady Thistlebrain — Try it on the dog — 
Criminality of the English Caterer — The stove, the stink, 
the steamer — Roasting -v. Baking — False Economy — Dirty 
ovens — Frills and fingers — Time over Dinner — A long- 
winded Bishop — Corned beef. 

Now for the cause, alluded to at the end of the 
last chapter. 

Imprimis^ the French invasion is due to the 
universal craze for imitation, which may be the 
sincerest form of flattery, but which frequently 
leads to bad results. For years past the fair sex 
of Great Britain have been looking to Paris for 
fashion in dress, as well as in cookery ; whilst 
the other sex have long held the mistaken notion 
that "they manage things better in France." 
The idea that France is the only country cap- 
able of clothing the outer and the inner man, 
artistically, has taken deep root. Thus, if the 
Duchess of Dulverton import, regardless of 
expense, a divine creation in bonnets from the 



^4 CAKES AND ALE 

Rue de Castigllone, and air the same in church, 
it is good odds that Httle Mrs. Stokes, of the 
Talbot Road, Bayswater, will have had the 
chapeau copied, at about one-twentieth of the 
original cost, by the next Sabbath day. Dear 
Lady Thistlebrain, who has such taste (since she 
quitted the family mangle in Little Toke Street, 
Lambeth, for two mansions, a castle, and a deer 
park), and with whom money is no object, pays 
her chef the wages of an ambassador, and every- 
body raves over her dinners. Mrs. Potter of 
Maida Vale sets her "gal" (who studied higher 
gastronomy, together with the piano, and flower- 
painting on satin, at the Board School) to work 
on similar menus — with, on the whole, disastrous 
results. The London society and fashion journals 
encourage this snobbish idea by quoting menus^ 
most of them ridiculous. Amongst the middle 
classes the custom of giving dinner parties at 
hotels has for some time past been spreading, partly 
to save trouble, and partly to save the brain of the 
domestic cook ; so that instead of sitting down to 
a plain dinner, with, maybe, an entree or two sent 
in by the local confectioner — around the family 
mahogany tree, all may be fanciful decoration, 
and not half enough to eat, electric light, and 
a la with attendance charged in the bill. 

The only way to stop this sort of thing is to 
bring the system into ridicule, to try it on the 
groundlings. A fair leader of ton^ late in the 
sixties, appeared one morning in the haunts of 
fashion, her shapely shoulders covered with a cape 
of finest Russian sables, to the general admiration 
and envy of all her compeers. Thereupon, what 



DINNER 75 

did her dearest friend and (of course) most deadly 
rival do ? Get a similar cape, or one of finer 
quality ? Not a bit of it. She drove ofF, then and 
there, to her furriers, and had her coachman and 
footman fitted with similar capes, in (of course) 
cheaper material ; and, when next afternoon she 
took the air in the park, in her perfectly appointed 
landau, her fur-clad menials created something 
like a panic in the camp of her enemy, whilst fur 
capes for fair leaders of " ton^'' were, like hashed 
venison at a City luncheon, very soon " hofF." 

It is extremely probable that, could it be 
arranged to feed our starving poor, beneath the 
public gaze, on soles Normandes^ cotelettes a la 
Reform^ and salmi de gihier truffi ; to feast our 
workhouse children on bisque d'^ecrevisses and 
Ananas a la Creole^ the upper classes of Great 
Britain would soon revert to plain roast and 
boiled. 

But after all it is the English caterer who is 
chiefly to blame for his own undoing. How is 
it that in what may be called the " food streets " 
of the metropolis the foreign food-supplier should 
outnumber the purveyor of the Roast Beef of Old 
England in the proportion of fifty to one ? 
Simply because the Roast Beef of Old England 
has become almost as extinct as the Dodo. There 
are but few English kitchens, at this end of the 
nineteenth century, in the which meat is roasted 
in front of the fire. 

In order to save the cost of fuel, most English 
(save the mark !) cooking is now performed by 
gas or steam ; and at many large establishments 
the food, whether fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables or 



76 CAKES AND ALE 

pastry, all goes, in a raw state, into a species of 
chest of drawers made of block-tin, in which 
receptacle the daily luncheons, dinners, and 
suppers are steamed and robbed of all flavour, 
save that of hot tin. The pity of it ! Better, 
far better for mankind the a la system than 
to be gradually " steamed " into the tomb ! 

It is alleged that as good results in the way of 
roasting can be got from an oven as from the 
spit. But that oven must be ventilated — with 
both an inlet and an outlet ventilator, for one 
will not act without the other. It is also 
advisable that said oven should be cleaned out 
occasionally ; for a hot oven with no joint therein 
will emit odours anything but agreeable, if not 
attended to ; and it is not too sweeping a state- 
ment to say that the majority of ovens in busy 
kitchens are foul. The system of steaming food 
(the alleged " roasts " being subsequently browned 
in an oven) is of comparatively recent date ; but 
the oven as a roaster was the invention of one 
Count Rumford, at the beginning of the nine- 
teenth century. In one of his lectures on oven- 
roasting, this nobleman remarked that he despaired 
of getting any Englishman to believe his words ; 
so that he was evidently confronted with plenty 
of prejudice, which it is devoutly to be prayed 
still exists in English homes. For I do vow and 
protest that the oven odours which pervade the 
neighbourhood of the Strand, London, at midday, 
are by no means calculated to whet the appetite 
of the would-be luncher or diner. This is what 
such an authority as Mr. Buckmaster wrote on 
the subject of the spit versus the oven : 



DINNER 77 

" I believe I am regarded as a sort of heretic on the 
question of roasting meat. My opinion is that the 
essential condition of good roasting is constant bast- 
ing, and this the meat is not likely to have when shut 
up in an iron box ; and what is not easily done is 
easily neglected." 

In this connection there are more he^'etics 
than Mr. Buckmaster. But if during my life- 
time the days of burning heretics should be 
revived, I shall certainly move the Court of 
Criminal Appeal in favour of being roasted or 
grilled before, or over, the fire, instead of being 
deprived of my natural juices in an iron box. 

Some few " roast " houses are still in existence 
in London, but they be few and far between ; 
and since Mr. Cooper gave up the "Albion," 
nearly opposite the stage- door of Drury Lane 
Theatre, the lover of good, wholesome, English 
food has lost one old-fashioned tavern in the 
which he was certain of enjoying such food. 

It has been repeatedly urged in favour of 
French cookery that it is so economical. But 
economy in the preparation of food is by no 
means an unmixed blessing. I do not believe 
that much sole-leather is used up in the ordinary 
ragout, or salmi ; but many of us who can afford 
more expensive joints have a prejudice against 
" scrags " ; whilst the tails of mutton chops 
frequently have a tainted flavour, and the drum- 
sticks and backs of fowls are only fit to grill, or 
boil down into gravy. And it is not only the 
alien who is economical in his preparation of the 
banquet. Many of the dwellers in the highways 
and byeways of our great metropolis will boil 



78 CAKES AND ALE 

down the outer skin of a ham, and place a portion 
thereof, together with such scraps as may also be 
purchased, at a penny or twopence the plateful, 
at the ham and beef emporium, with maybe a 
"block ornament" or two from the'^ butcher's, 
in a pie dish, with a superstructure of potatoes, 
and have the " scrap pie " cooked at the baker's for 
the Sunday dinner. Poor wretches ! Not much 
"waste" goes on in such households. But I 
have known the " gal " who tortured the food in 
a cheap lodging-house throw away the water 
in which a joint had just been boiled, but whether 
this was from sheer ignorance, or " cussedness," 
or the desire to save herself any future labour in 
the concoction of soup, deponent sayeth not. By 
the way, it' is in the matter of soup that the 
tastes of the British and French peasantry differ 
so materially. Unless he or she be absolutely 
starving, it is next to impossible to get one of the 
groundlings of old England to attempt a basin of 
soup. And when they do attempt the same, it 
has been already made for them. The Scotch, 
who are born cooks, know much better than this ; 
6ut do not, O reader, if at all thin of skin, or 
/efined of ear, listen too attentively to the thanks 
which a denizen of the " disthressful counthry " 
will bestow upon you for a " dhirty bowl o' bone- 
juice." 

How many modern diners, we wonder, know 
the original object of placing frills around the 
shank of a leg or shoulder of mutton, a ham, 
the shins of a fowl, or the bone of a cutlet ? 
Fingers were made before — and a long time 
before — forks. In the seventeenth century — 



DINNER 79 

prior to which epoch not much nicety was 
observed in carving, or eating — we read that 
" English gentlewomen were instructed by school- 
mistresses and professors of etiquette as to the 
ways in which it behoved them to carve joints. 
That she might be able to grasp a roasted chicken 
without greasing her left hand, the gentle house- 
wife was careful to trim its foot and the lower 
part of its legs with cut paper. The paper frill 
which may still be seen round the bony point 
and small end of a leg of mutton, is a memorial 
of the fashion in which joints were dressed for the 
dainty hands of lady-carvers, in time prior to the 
introduction of the carving-fork, an implement 
that was not in universal use so late as the 
Commonwealth." 

How long we should sit over the dinner-table 
is a matter of controversy. At the commence- 
ment of the nineteenth century, in the hard- 
drinking times, our forefathers were loth indeed 
to quit the table. But the fairer portion of the 
guests were accustomed to adjourn early, for tea 
and scandal in the withdrawing-room, the while 
their lords sat and quarrelled over their port, with 
locked doors ; and where they fell there they 
frequentl^l^ passed the night. The editor of the 
Almanack des Gourmands wrote : '' Five hours at 
table are a reasonable latitude to allow in the case 
of a large party and recondite cheer." But the 
worthy Grimod de la Reymiere, the editor afore- 
said, lived at a period when dinner was not served 
as late as 8.30 p.m. There is a legend of an 
Archbishop of York " who sat three entire years 
at dinner." But this is one of those tales which 



So CAKES AND ALE 

Specially suited the dull, brandy-sodden brains of 
our ancestors. The facts are simply as follows : — 
the archbishop had just sat down to dinner at 
noon when an Italian priest called. Hearing that 
the dignitary was sitting at meat the priest whiled 
away an hour in looking at the minster, and 
called again, but was again " repelled by the 
porter." Twice more that afternoon did the 
surly porter repel the Italian, and at the fourth 
visit " the porter, in a heate, answered never a 
worde, and churlishlie did shutte the gates upon 
him." Then the discomfited ItaHan returned to 
Rome ; and three years later, encountering an 
EngHshman in the Eternal City, who declared 
himself right well known to His Grace of York, 
the Italian, all smiles, inquired : " I pray you, 
good sir, hath that archbishop finished dinner 
yet ? " Hence the story, which was doubtless 
originally told by a fly- fisher. 

It is not a little singular that with increasing 
civilisation, a gong, which is of barbaric, or semi- 
barbaric origin, should be the means usually em- 
ployed to summon us to the dinner-table. In 
days of yore the horn, or cornet, was blown as 
the signal. Alexander Dumas tells us that "at 
the period when noon was the dinner hour, the 
horn or cornet [le cor) was used in great houses 
to announce dinner. Hence came an expression 
which has been lost ; they used to say cornet (or 
trumpet) the dinner {cornez le diner). ^^ And we 
are asked to believe that to this practice " corned " 
beef owes its derivation. " In days when inferior 
people ate little meat in the winter months save 
salted beef, the more usual form of the order was 



DINNER 8x 

cornez le bceuf^ or 'corn the beef.* Richardson 
errs egregiously when he insists that corned beef 
derived its distinguishing epithet from the grains 
or corns of salt with which it was pickled. 
Corned beef is trumpeted beef, or as we should 
nowadays say, dinner-bell beef." 

Well — "I hae ma doots," as the Scotsman 
said. I am not so sure that Richardson erred 
egregiously. But after all, as long as the beef be 
good, and can be carved without the aid of pick 
and spade, what does it matter l Let us to 
dinner !

A Christmas dinner in the early Victorian era ! 
^elle fete magnifique I The man who did not 
keep Christmas in a fitting manner in those days 
was not thought much of. " Dines by himself 
at the club on Christmas day ! " was tiie way 
the late Mr. George Payne of sporting memory, 
summed up a certain middle-aged recluse, with 
heaps of money, who, although he had two 
estates in the country, preferred to live in two 
small rooms in St. James's Place, S.W., and to 
take his meals at " Arthur's." 

And how we boys (not to mention the little 
lasses in white frocks and black mittens) used to 
overeat oiirselves, on such occasions, with no f^ar 



DINNER 83 

of pill, draught, or "staying in," before our 
eyes ! 

The writer has in his mind's eye a good 
specimen of such an old-fashioned dinner, as 
served in the fifties. It was pretty much the 
same feast every Christmas. We commenced 
with some sort of clear soup, with meat in it. 
Then came a codfish, crimped — the head of that 
household would have as soon thought of eating 
a sole au vin hlanc as of putting before his family 
an uncrimped cod — with plenty of liver, oyster 
sauce, and pickled walnuts ; and at the other end 
of the table was a dish of fried smelts. Entrees ? 
Had any of the diners asked for an entrie^ his or 
her exit from the room would have been a some- 
what rapid one. A noble sirloin of Scotch beef 
faced a boiled turkey anointed with celery sauce; 
and then appeared the blazing pudding, and the 
mince-pies. For the next course, a dish of 
toasted (or rather stewed) cheese, home-made 
and full of richness, was handed round, with dry 
toast, the bearer of which was closely pursued by 
a varlet carrying a huge double-handed vessel of 
hot spiced-ale, bobbing or floating about in the 
which were roasted crab -apples and sippets of 
toast ; and it was de rigueur for each of those 
who sat at meat to extract a sippet, to eat with 
the cheese. 

How the old retainer, grey and plethoric with 
service, loved us boys, and how he would 
manoeuvre to obtain for us the tit-bits ! A favoured 
servitor was "Joseph" ; and though my revered 
progenitor was ostensibly the head of the house, 
he would, on occasion, " run a bad second " to 



84 CAKES AND ALE 

"Joseph." Memory is still keen of a certain 
chilly evening in September, when the ladies 
had retired to the drawing-room, and the male 
guests were invited to be seated at the small 
table which had been wheeled close to the 
replenished fire. 

"Joseph," said the dear old man, "bring us a 
bottle or two of the yellow seal — you know — 
Bin F." 

The servitor drew near to his master, and in a 
stage whisper exclaimed : 

" You can't afFord it, sir ! ** 

" What's that ? " roared the indignant old 
man. 

" You can't afFord it, sir — Hawthornden's won 
th' Leger ! " 

« Good Gad ! " A pause— and then, " Well, 
never mind, Joseph, we'll have up the yellow 
seal, all the same." 

One of the writer's last Christmas dinners was 
partaken of in a sweet little house in Mayfair ; 
and affords somewhat of a contrast with the 
meal quoted above. We took our appetites away 
with a salad composed of anchovies, capers, 
truffles, and other things, a Russian sardine or 
two, and rolls and butter. Thence we drifted 
into Bouillabaisse (a tasty but bile - provoking 
broth), toyed with some filets de sole a la 
Parisienne (good but greasy), and disposed of a 
tourmdos^ with a nice fat oyster atop, apiece [et 
parlez-moi d^fa I). Then came some dickey- 
birds sur canape — alleged to be snipe, but destitute 
of flavour, save that of the tin they had been 
spoiled in, and of the "canopy." An alien cook 



DINNER 85 

can not cook game, whatever choice confections 
he may turn out — at least that is the experience 
of the writer. We had cressons^ of course, with 
the birds ; though how water-cress can possibly 
assimilate with the flesh of a snipe is questionable. 
" Water-creases " are all very well at tea in 
the arbour, but don't go smoothly with any 
sort of fowl J and to put such rank stuff into 
a salad — as my hostess's cook did — is absolutely 
criminal. 

To continue the Mayfair banquet, the salad 
was followed by a souffiee a la Noel (which re- 
minded some of the more imaginative of our 
party of the festive season), some cheese straws, 
and the customary ices, coffee, and liqueurs. 
On the whole, not a bad meal ; but what would 
old Father Christmas have said thereto ? What 
would my revered progenitor have remarked, 
had he been allowed to revisit the glimpses of 
the moon } He did not love our lively neigh- 
bours ; and, upon the only occasion on which he 
was inveigled across the Channel, took especial 
care to recross it the very next day, lest, through 
circumstances not under his own control, he 

might come to be "buried amongst these d d 

French ! " 

The following menu may give some idea as to 
how 

Royalty 

entertains its guests. Said menu^ as will be seen, 
is comparatively simple, and many of the dishes 
are French only in name : —

Truly a pattern dinner, this ; and 'twould be 
sheer impertinence to comment thereon, beyond 
remarking that English dishes should, in common 
fairness, be called by English names. 

Her Imperial Majesty the Tsaritza, on the 
night of her arrival at Darmstadt, in October 
1896, sat down, together with her august husband, 
to the following simple meal ; —

the same quarter of the red deer]. 



Terrine de Perdreaux 



Ponche Royale 



Poularde de Metz 



Choux de Bruxelles 



Bavarois aux Abricots 



Glaces Panachees 

The partiality of crowned heads towards 
" Bavarois aux Abricots " — " Bavarois " is simply 
Bavarian cheese, a superior sort of blanc mange — 
is proverbial. And the above repast was served 
on priceless Meissen china and silver. The 
only remarks I will make upon the above menu 
are that it is quite possible that the capon may 
have come from Metz, though not very probable. 
French cooks name their meat and poultry in 
the most reckless fashion. For instance, owing 
to this /eckless nomenclature the ^belief has 
grown that the best ducks come from Rouen. 
Nothing of the sort. There are just as good 
ducks raised at West Hartlepool as at Rouen. 
" Rouen " in the bill-of-fare is simply a corrup- 



88 CAKES AND ALE 

tion of "roan " ; and a "roan duck " is a quacker 
who has assumed (through crossing) the reddish 
plumage of the wild bird. As for (alleged) Surrey 
fowls, most of them come from Heathiield in 
Sussex, whence ^142,000 worth were sent in 
1896. 

Let us enquire into the composition of some 
of the high-sounding plats^ served up by the 
average chef. 

Bouillabaisse, — Of it Thackeray sang — 

" This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is — 
A sort of soup, or broth, or brew, 

Or hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes 
That Greenwich never could outdo : 

Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron, 

Soles, onions, garlic, roach, and dace ; 

All these you eat at Terre's tavern, 
In that one dish of Bouillabaisse." 

Avoid eels and herrings in this concoction as 
too oily. Soles, mullet, John Dory, v^rhiting, 
flounders, perch, roach, and mussels will blend 
well, and allow half a pound of fish for each 
person. For every pound of fish put in the 
stewpan a pint of water, a quarter of a pint of 
white wine, and a table-spoonful of salad oil. If 
there be four partakers, add two sHced onions, 
two cloves, two bay-leaves, two leeks (the white 
part only, chopped), four cloves of garlic, a 
table-spoonful chopped parsley, a good squeeze 
of lemon juice, half an ounce of chopped capsi- 
cums, a teaspoonful (or more ad lib.) of saffron, 
with pepper and salt. Mix the chopped fish in 
all this, and boil for half an hour. Let the 



DINNER 89 

mixture " gallop " and strain into a tureen with 
sippets, and the fish served separately. 

Tournedos — No relation to tornado, and you 
won't find the word in any Gallic dictionary. 
A tournedos is a thin collop of beef, steeped in 
a marinade for twenty-four hours (personally I 
prefer it without the aid of the marine) and fried 
lightly. Turn it but once. The oyster atop is 
simply scalded. Try this dish. 

Bisque. — In the seventeenth century this was 
made from pigeons by the poor barbarians who 
knew not the gentle lobster, nor the confiding 
crayfish. Heat up to boiling-point a Mirepoix 
of white wine. You don't know what a 

Mirepoix 

is ? Simply a taggot of vegetables, named after 
a notorious cuckold of noble birth in the time 
of Louis XV. Two carrots, two onions, two 
shalots, two bay-leaves, a sprig of thyme and a 
clove of garlic. Mince very small, with half a 
pound of fat bacon, half a pound of raw ham, 
pepper and salt, and a little butter. Add a 
sufficiency of white wine. In this mixture 
cook two dozen crayfish for twenty minutes, 
continually tossing them about till red, when 
take them out to cool. Shell them, all but the 
claws, which should be pounded in a mortar and 
mixed with butter. The flesh of the tails is 
reserved to be put in the soup at the last minute ; 
the body-flesh goes back into the mirepoix^ to 
which two quarts of broth are now added. Add 
the pounded shells to the soup, simmer for an 
hour and a half, strain, heat up, add a piece of 



90 CAKES AND ALE 

butter, the tails, a seasoning of cayenne, and a 
few quenelles of whiting. 

Vol-au-vent Financiere, — This always reminds 
me of the fearful threat hurled by the waiter in 
the " Bab Ballads " at his flighty sweetheart : 

** Flirtez toujours, ma belle, si tu oses, 
Je me vengerai ainsi, ma ch^re : 
Je lui dirai d'quoi on compose 
Vol-au-vent \ la Financiere ! " 

Make your crust — light as air, and flaky as snow, 
an you value your situation — and fill with button 
mushrooms, truffles, cock's-combs, quenelles of chicken, 
and sweetbread, all chopped, seasoned, and moistened 
with a butter sauce. Brown gravy is objection- 
able. Garnish the Vol with fried parsley, which 
which goes well with most luxuries of this sort. 

There are some words which occur frequently 
in French cookery which, to the ordinary per- 
fidious Briton, are cruelly misleading. For 
years I was under the impression that Brillat 
Savarin was a species of filleted fish (brill) in a 
rich gravy, instead of a French magistrate, who 
treated gastronomy poetically, and always ate his 
food too fast. And only within the last decade 
have I discovered what a 

Pre Sale 

really means. Literally, it is "salt meadow, or 
marsh." It is said that sheep fed on a salt marsh 
make excellent mutton ; but is it not about time 
for Britannia, the alleged pride of the ocean, and 
ruler of its billows, to put her foot down and 
protest against a leg of "prime Down" — but 



DINNER 91 

recently landed from the Antipodes — being 
described on the card as a Gigot de pre sale ? 

The meals, like the ways, of the " Heathen 
Chinee " are peculiar. Some of his food, to 
quote poor Corney Grain, is ''absolutely beastly." 

Li Hung Chang 

was welcomed to Carlton House Terrace, London, 
with a dinner, in twelve courses, the following 
being the principal items: — Roast duck, roast 
pork and raspberry jam, followed by dressed 
cucumber. Shrimps were devoured, armour and 
all, with leeks, gherkins, and mushrooms. A 
couple of young chickens preserved in wine and 
vinegar, with green peas, a puree of pigeon's legs 
followed by an assortment of sour jellies. The 
banquet concluded with sponge cakes and tea. 
In his own land the 

Chinaman^ s Evening Repast 

is much more variegated than the above. It is 
almost as long as a Chinese drama, and includes 
melon seeds, bitter almonds, bamboo sprouts, 
jelly-fish, cucumber, roast duck, chicken stewed 
in spirit dregs,^ peas, prawns, sausages, scalleons, 
fish-brawn, pork chops, plum blossoms, oranges, 
bird*s-nest soup, pigeons' eggs in bean curd — the 
eggs being " postponed " ones — fungus, shrimps, 
macerated fish-fins, ham in flour, ham in honey, 
turnip cakes, roast sucking-pig, fish maws, roast 

^ This dish must somewhat resemble the "Fixed Bayonet," 
which at one time was the favourite tit-bit of " Tommy Atkins," 
when quartered in India. It consisted of a fowl, stuffed with 
green chilis, and boiled in rum. The fowl was picked to the 
bones, and the soldier wound up with the soup. Very tasty ! 
H 



9* CAKES AND ALE 

mutton, wild ducks' feet, water chestnuts, egg 
rolls, lily seeds, stewed mushrooms, dressed crab 
with jam, chrysanthemum pasties, heche-de-mer^ 
and pigs' feet in honey. Can it be wondered at 
that this nation should have been brought to its 
knees by gallant little Japan ? 

The Englishman in China 

has not a particularly good time of it, in the 
gastronomic way, and H.M. forces in Hong 
Kong are largely dependent on Shanghai for 
supplies. There is "plenty pig" all over the 
land ; but the dairy-fed pork of old England is 
preferable. And the way "this little pig goes 
to market " savours so strongly of the most 
refined cruelty that a branch of the R.S.P.C.A. 
would have the busiest of times of it over yonder. 
Reverting to French cookery, here is an 
appetising dish, called a 

Bernardin Salmi, 

It should be prepared in the dining-room, before 
the eyes of the guests j and Grimod de la 
Reyniere (to whom the recipe was given by the 
prior of an abbey of Bernardin monks) recom- 
mends that the salmi should be conveyed to the 
mouth with a fork, for fear of devouring one's 
fingers, should they touch the sauce. 

Take three woodcocks, underdone, and cut them 
into neat portions. On a silver dish bruise the 
livers and trails, squeeze over them the juice of 
four (?) lemons, and grate over them a little of the 
thin rind. Add the portions of woodcock, seasoned 
with salt, and — according to the prior — mixed spices 



DINNER 93 

and two teaspoonfuls of French mustard ; but the 
writer would substitute cayenne seul : over all half 
a wine-glass of sherry ; and then put the dish over 
a spirit lamp. When the mixture is nearly boiling, 
add a tablespoonful of salad oil, blow out the light, 
and stir well. Four lemons are mentioned in this 
recipe, as at the time it was written lemons were 
very small when " cocks " were " in." 7wo imported 
lemons (or limes) will amply suffice nowadays. 

A Salmi of Wild Duck 

can be made almost in the same way, but here 
the aid of that modern instrument the Duck- 
Squeezer is necessary. 

Cut the best of the meat in slices, off a lightly- 
roasted wild-duck, after brought to table ; break up 
the carcase and place in a species of mill (silver) 
called a "duck-squeezer," which possesses a spout 
through which the richness of the animal escapes, 
after being squeezed. Make a gravy of this liquor, 
in a silver dish (with a spirit lamp beneath), added 
to a small pat of butter, the juice of a lemon, a 
table-spoonful of Worcester sauce, with cayenne and 
salt to taste, and half a wine-glassful of port wine. 
Warm the meat through in this gravy, which mus 
not boil. 

Of course these two last-named dishes are only 
intended for bachelor- parties. Lovely woman 
must not be kept waiting for " duck-squeezers " 
or anything else. 

The Jesuits 

introduced the turkey into Europe, of which 
feat the Jesuits need not boast too much j for to 



94 CAKK6 AND ALE 

some minds there be many better edible birds ; and 
the " gobbler " requires, when roasted or boiled, 
plenty of seasoning to make him palatable. The 
French stuiF him in his roasted state, with 
truffles, fat forcemeat, or chestnuts, and invariably 
" bard " the bird — " bard " is old English as well 
as old French — with fat bacon. The French 
turkey is also frequently brazed, with an abundant 
mirepoix made with what their cooks call 
"Madere," but which is really Marsala. It is 
only we English who boil the " gobbler," and 
stuff him (or her, for it is the hen who usually 
goes into the pot) with oysters, or forcemeat, 
with celery sauce. Probably the best parts of 
the turkey are his legs, when grilled for breakfast, 
and smothered with the sauce mentioned in one 
of the chapters on " Breakfast " ; and 

Pulled Turkey 

makes an agreeable luncheon -dish, or entrh at 
dinner, the breast-meat being pulled off the bone 
with a fork, and fricasseed, surrounded in the dish 
by the grilled thighs and pinions. 

Who introduced the turkey into America 
deponent sayeth not. Probably, like Topsy, 
it " growed " there. Anyhow the bird is so 
familiar a table-companion in the States, that 
Americans, when on tour in Europe, light very 
shy of him. "Tukkey, sah, cranberry sarce," 
used to be the stereotyped reply of the black 
waiter when interrogated on the subject of the 
bill of fare. 

Coloured Help 

is, however, gradually being ousted (together 



DINNER 95 

with sulphur matches) from the big hotels in 
New York, where white waiting and white food 
are coming into, or have come into, regular use. 
In fact, with the occasional addition of one or 
other of such special dishes as terrapin, soft-shell 
crab, clam chowder, and the everlasting pork 
and beans, a dinner in New York diiFers very 
little at the time of writing (1897) from one in 
London. The taste for 

Clam Chowder 

is an acquired one, nor will stewed tortoise ever 
rank with thick turtle in British estimation, 
although 'tis not the same tortoise which is used in 
London households to break the coals with. A 

Canvass-back Duck^ 

if eaten in the land of his birth, is decidedly the 
most delicately-flavoured of all the "Quack" 
family. His favourite food is said to be wild 
celery, and his favoured haunts the neighbourhood 
of Chesapeake Bay, from whose waters comes 
the much prized " diamond -back " terrapin, 
which is sold at the rate of 50$ or 60S the dozen. 
The canvass-back duck, however, suffers in trans- 
portation ; in fact, the tendency of the ice-house 
aboard ship is to rob all food of its flavour. 
But however good be the living in 

New Tork City 

— where the hotels are the best in the world, and 
whose Mr. Delmonico can give points to all 
sorts and conditions of food caterers — it is "a 
"bit rough " in the provinces. There is a story 



9(5 CAKES AND ALE 

told of a young actor, on tour, who "struck" 
a small town out West, and put up at a small 
inn. In the course of time dinner was served, 
and the landlord waited at table. The principal 
cover was removed, disclosing a fine joint of 
coarsish, indifFerently-coolced beef. Our young 
actor was strangely moved at the sight. 

" What ? " he cried. " Beef again ? This is 
horrible ! I've seen no other food for months, 
and Vm sick and tired of it. I can't eat beef." 

Whereupon his host whipped out a huge 
" six-shooter " revolver, and covering the recalci- 
trant beef-eater, coolly remarked : 

" Guess you kin ! " 

But I don't believe that story, any more than 
I believe the anecdote of the cowboys and the 
daylight let through the visitor who couldn't eat 
beans.

" What's in a name ? " inquired the love-sick 
Juliet. " What .? " echoes the bad fairy " Ala'' 
After all the fuss made by the French over their 
soups, we might expect more variety than is 
given us. If it be true that we English have only 
one sauce, it is equally true that our lively neigh- 
bours have only one soup — and that one is a broth. 
It is known to the frequenters of restaurants 
under at least eleven different na.mes : ^Brunoise^ 
Jardiniere^ Printanier^ Chiffonadey Macedoine^ 



98 CAKES AND ALE 

Julienne^ Fauhonne^ Paysanne^ Flamande^ Mlton- 
nage^ Croute au Pot^ and, as Sam Weller would 
say, " It's the flavouring as does it." It is simply 
bouillon^ plain broth, and weak at that. The 
addition of a cabbage, or a leek, or a common 
or beggar's crust, will change a potage a la 
yard'in'iere into a Croute au Pot^ and vice versa. 
Great is " Ma " j and five hundred per cent is 
her profit ! 

The amount of money lavished by diners- 
about upon the productions of the alien chef 
would be ludicrous to consider, were not the 
extravagance absolutely criminal. The writer 
has partaken of about the most expensive dinner — 
English for the most part, with French names to 
the dishes — that could be put on the table, the 
charge being (including wines) one guinea per 
mouth. Another banquet, given by a gay youth 
who had acquired a large sum through ruining 
somebody else on the Stock Exchange — the meal 
positively reeking of Ala — was charged for by 
the hotel manager at the rate of sixteen pounds per 
head, also including wines. I was told afterwards, 
though I am still sceptical as to the veracity of 
the statement, that the flowers on the table at 
that banquet cost alone more than ;f 75. And 
only on the previous Sunday, our host's father 
— a just nobleman and a God-fearing — had 
delivered a lecture, at a popular institution, on 
"Thrift." 

Here follows the menu of the above-mentioned 
guinea meal,

tod CAKES AND AL^ 

There are only three faults I can find in the 
above programme : ( i ) Confusion to the man 
who expects the British Army to swallow green 
fat in French. (2) Whitebait is far too delicately 
flavoured a fowl to curry. (3) Too much eating 
and drinking. 

City Dinners 

are for the most part an infliction (or aflliction) 
on the diner. With more than fourscore sitting 
at meat, the miracle of the loaves and fishes is 
repeated — with, frequently, the fish left out. 

'' I give you my word, dear old chappie," once 
exclaimed a gilded youth who had been assisting 
at one of these functions, to the writer, " all I 
could get hold of, during the struggle, was an 
orange and a cold plate ! " 

The great and powerful system of 

Baksheesh^ 
of course, enters largely into these public enter- 
tainments ; and the man who omits to fee the 
waiter in advance, as a rule, " gets left." Book- 
makers and others who go racing are the 
greatest sinners in this respect. A well-known 
magnate of the betting-ring (1896) invariably, 
after arriving at an hotel, hunts up the chefy and 
sheds upon him a " fiver," or a " tenner," accord- 
ing to the size of the house, and the repute of its 
cookery. And that metallician and his party 
are not likely to starve during their stay, 
whatever may be the fate of those who omit to 
" remember " the Commissariat Department. I 
have seen the same bookmaker carry, with his own 
hands, the remains of a great dish of " Hot-pot " 



DINNER i6l 

into the dining-room of his neighbours, who had 
been ringing for a waiter, and clamouring for 
food for the best part of an hour, without effect. 
The same system prevails aboard ship ; and 
the passenger who has not propitiated the head 
steward at the commencement of the voyage 
will not fare sumptuously. The steamship com- 
panies may deny this statement ^ but 'tis true 
nevertheless. 

Dinner Afloat, 

Here is an average dinner-card during a life 
on the ocean wave : 

Julienne soup, boiled salmon with shrimp sauce, 
roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, jugged hare, 
French beans a la Maitre d^Hotel, chicken curry, 
roast turkey with puree of chestnuts, fanchouettes 
(what are they ? ), sausage rolls, greengage tarts, 
plum-puddings, lemon -jellies, biscuits and cheese, 
fruit, coffiM*, 

Plenty of variety here, though some epicures 
might resent the presence of a sausage-roll (the 
common or railway-station bag of mystery) on 
the dinner table. But since the carriage of Hve 
stock aboard passenger ships has been abandoned, 
the living is not nearly as good ; for, as before 
observed, the tendency of the ice-house is to 
make all flesh taste alike. Civilisation has, 
doubtless, done wonders for us ; but most people 
prefer mutton to have a flavour distinct from 
that of beef. 

^y Ideal Dinner 

was partaken of in a little old-fashioned hostelry 



102 CAKES AND ALE 

(at the west end of London), whose name the 
concentrated efforts of all the wild horses in the 
world would not extract. Familiarity breeds 
contempt, and publicity oft kills that which 
is brought to light. Our host was a wine- 
merchant in a large way of business. 

" I can only promise you plain food, good sirs," 
he mentioned, in advance — "no foreign kick- 
shaws ', but everything done to a turn." 

Six of us started with clear turtle, followed by 
a thick wedge out of the middle of a patriarchal 
codfish, with plenty of liver. And here a pause 
must be made. In not one cookery-book known 
to mankind can be found a recipe for cooking the 

Liver of a Cod, 

Of course it should not be cooked with the fish, 
but in a separate vessel. The writer once went 
the rounds of the kitchens to obtain information 
on this point. 

" 'Bout half-an-hour," said one cook, a " hard- 
bitten " looking food-spoiler. 

" Ma foi ! I cook not at all the liver of the 
cod," said an unshorn son of Normandy. " He 
is for the malade only." 

AfteJ^' asking a number of questions, and a 
journey literally " round the town," the deduction 
made from the various answers was that a piece 
of liver enough for six people would take eight- 
een minutes, after being placed in boiling water. 

To continue with our dinner. No sauce 
with the oysters, but these simply scalded in 
their own liquor. Then came on a monster 
steak, an inch thick, cut from the rump immedi-

ately before being placed on the gridiron. And 
here a word on the grilling of a steak. We 
English place it nearer the fire than do our 
lively neighbours, whose grills do not, in conse- 
quence, present that firm surface which is the 
charm of an English steak. The -late Mr. 
Godfrey Turner of the Daily Telegraph (who 
was almost as great an authority as Mr. Sala 
on gastronomies) once observed to the writer, 
"Never turn your steak, or chop, more than 
once." Though by no means a disciple of 
Ala^ he was evidently a believer in the French 
method of grilling, which leaves a sodden, flabby 
surface on the meat. The French cook only 
turns a steak once j but if he had his gridiron as 
close to the fire as his English rival, the chef 
would inevitably cremate his morgeau (Tbceuf. I 
take it that in grilling, as in roasting, the meat 
should, in the first instance, almost touch the 
glowing embers. 

We had nothing but horse-radish with our 
steak, which was succeeded by golden plovers 
(about the best bird that flies) and marrow 
bones. And a dig into a ripe Stilton concluded 
a banquet which we would not have exchanged 
for the best efforts of FrancatelH himself. 

Yes — despite the efforts of the bad fairy Jla^ 
the English method of cooking good food — if 
deftly and properly employed — is a long way the 
better method, • Unfortunately, through the fault 
of the English themselves, this method is but 
seldom employed deftly or properly. And at a 
cheap English eating-house the kitchen is usu- 
ally as dirty and malodorous as at an inexpensive 



I04 CAKES AND ALE 

foreign restaurant. As both invariably serve as 
sleeping apartments during the silent watches of 
the night, this is, perhaps, not altogether to be 
wondered at. 

But there is one plat in the French cookery 
book w^hich is not to be sneered at, or even con- 
demned vv^ith faint praise. A properly-dressed 
fricandeau is a dainty morsel indeed. In fact the 
word fricand means, in English, "dainty." 
Here is the recipe of the celebrated Gouffe for 
the Fricandeau : 

Three pounds of veal fillet, trimmed, and larded 
with fat bacon. Put in the glazing stewpan the 
trimmings, two ounces of sliced carrot, two ditto 
onion, with pepper and salt. Lay the fricandeau on 
the top ; add half a pint of broth ; boil the broth 
till it is reduced and becomes thick and yellow ; 
add a pint and a half more broth, and simmer for an 
hour and a quarter — the stewpan half covered 
Then close the stewpan and put live coals on the 
top. Baste the fricandeau with the gravy — pre- 
sumably after the removal of the dead coals — every 
four minutes till it is sufficiently glazed ; then take 
it out and place on a dish. Strain the gravy, skim 
off the fat, and pour over the meat. It may be 
added that a spirit lamp beneath the dish is (or 
should be) de rigueur. 

In their clubs, those (alleged) " gilded saloons 
of profligacy and debauchery, favoured of the 
aristocracy," men, as a rule dine wisely, and well, 
and, moreover, cheaply. The extravagant diner- 
out, with his crude views on the eternal fitness 
of things, selects an hotel, or restaurant, in the 
whichj although the food may be of the worst 



DINNER los 

quality, and the cookery of the greasiest, the 
charges are certain to be on the millionaire scale. 
For bad dinners, like bad lodgings, are invariably 
the dearest. 

At the Mess-Table 

of the British officer there is not much riot or 
extravagance nov^adays, and the food is but in- 
differently well cooked ; though there was a 
time when the youngest cornet would turn up 
his nose at anything commoner than a "special 
cuvee " of champagne, and would unite with his 
fellows in the "bear -fight" which invariably 
concluded a "guest night," and during which 
the messman, or one of his myrmidons, was 
occasionally placed atop of the ante-room fire. 
And there was one messman who even preferred 
that mode of treatment to being lectured by his 
colonel. Said officer was starchy, punctilious, 
and long-winded, and upon one occasion, when 
the chaplain to the garrison was his guest at 
dinner, addressed the terrified servant somewhat 
after this wise : 

"Mr. Messman — I have this evening bidden 
to our feast this eminent divine, who prayeth 
daily that we may receive the fruits of the earth 
in due season ; to which I, an humble layman, 
am in the habit of responding : 'We beseech thee 
to hear us, good Lord.' Mr. Messman, don't 
let me see those d~ d figs on the table again." 

At a military guest-night in India, a turkey 
and a " Europe " ham are — or were — de rigueur 
at table j and on the whole the warrior fares 
well, if the khansamah do not attempt luxuries.

His chicken cutlets are not despicable, and we 
can even forgive the repetition of the vilolif^ but 
his bifisteakishtoo (stevi^ed steak) is usually too 
highly-spiced for the European palate. Later in 
the evening, however, he will come out strong 
with duvlebone^ and grilled sardines in curlpapers. 
The presence of the bagpipes, in the mess-room 
of a Highland regiment, when men have well 
drunk, is cruelly unkind — to the Saxon guest at 
all events. The bagpipe is doubtless a melodious 
instrument (to trained ears), but its melodies are 
apt to "hum i' th' head o'er muckle ye ken," 
after a course of haggis washed down with 
sparkHng wines and old port. 

"Tell me what a man eats," said Brillat 
Savarin, " and Til tell you what he is." 



Peter the Great 

did not like the presence of "listening lacqueys" 
in the dining-room. Peter's favourite dinner was, 
like himself, peculiar : " A soup, with four cabbages 
in it ; gruel ; pig, with sour cream for sauce ; cold 
roast meat with pickled cucumbers or salad ; 
lemons and lamprey, salt meat, ham, and Limburg 
cheese." 

"Lemons and lamprey" must have had a 
roughish seat, atop of pig and sour cream. I 
once tasted lampreys — only once. It was in 
Worcestershire, and said lampreys were stewed 
(I fancy) in burgundy, and served in a small 
tureen — en casserole^ our lively neighbours would 
have called the production, which was grateful, 
but much embarrassed with richness.

DINNER 107 

Napoleon the Great^ 

whose tastes were simple, is said to have preferred 
a broiled breast of mutton to any other dinner- 
dish. Napoleon III., however, encouraged ex- 
travagance of living ; and Zola tells us in Le 
Debacle that the unfortunate emperor, ill as he 
was, used to sit down to so many courses of rich 
foods every night until "the downfall" arrived 
at Sedan, and that a train of cooks and scullions 
with (literally) a ^^ batterie^'^ de cuisiney was 
attached to his staff. 

Her Majesty 
Queen Victoria's dinner-table is invariably graced 
with a cold sirloin of beef, amongst other joints ; 
and the same simple fare has satisfied the aspira- 
tions and gratified the palate of full many a 
celebrity. The great 

Duke of Wellington 
was partial to a well-made Irish stew; and 
nothing delighted Charles Dickens more than a 
slice out of the breast of a hot roast-goose. 

A word about the mushroom. Although said 
to be of enormous value in sauces and ragouts, I 
shall always maintain that the mushroom is best 
when eaten all by his quaint self. His flavour is 
so dehcate that 'tis pitiful to mix him with fish, 
flesh, or fowl — more especially the first- named. 
I have seen mushrooms and bacon cooked 
together, and I have seen beaf- steak (cut into 
small pieces) and bacon cooked together, 
and it was with some difliculty that my Irish 
host got me but of the kitchen. If ever I am 
I 






io8 CAKES AND ALE 

hanged, it will be for killing a cook. Above 
all never eat mushrooms which you have not 
seen in their uncooked state. The mushroom, 
like the truffle, loses more flavour the longer he 
is kept ; and to " postpone " either is fatal. 

" The plainer the meal the longer the life." 
Thus an eminent physician — already mentioned 
in these pages. "We begin with soup, and 
perhaps a glass of cold punch, to be followed by 
a piece of turbot, or a slice of salmon with 
lobster sauce ; and while the venison or South- 
down is getting ready, we toy with a piece of 
sweetbread, and mellow it with a bumper of 
Madeira. No sooner is the mutton or venison 
disposed of, with its never- failing accompani- 
ments of jelly and vegetables, than we set the 
whole of it in a ferment with champagne, and 
drown it with hock and sauterne. These are 
quickly followed by the wing and breast of a 
partridge, or a bit of pheasant or wild duck ; and 
when the stomach is all on fire with excitement, 
we cool it for an instant with a piece of iced 
pudding, and then immediately lash it into a fury 
with undiluted alcohol in the form of cognac 
or a strong liqueur ; after which there comes 
a spoonful or so of jelly as an emollient, a morsel 
of ripe Stilton as a digestant, a piquant salad to 
whet the appetite for wine, and a glass of old port 
to persuade the stomach, if it can, into quietness. 
All these are more leisurely succeeded by dessert, 
with its baked meats, its fruits, and its strong 
drinks, to be afterwards muddled with coffee, 
and complicated into a rare mixture with tea, 
floating with the richest creaiii/' 



DINNER 109 

Hoity, toity ! And not a word about a French 
pldt^ or even a curry, either ! But we must 
remember that this diatribe comes from a gentle- 
man who has laid down the theory that cold 
water is not only the cheapest of beverages, but 
the best. Exception, too, may be taken to the 
statement that a " piquant salad " whets the 
appetite for wine. I had always imagined that a 
salad — and, indeed, anything with vinegar in its 
composition — rather spoilt the human palate for 
wine than otherwise. And what sort of " baked 
meats " are usually served with desert ?

An esteemed friend who has seen better days, 
sends word how to dine a man, his wife, and

way of a full-flavoured combination ot poisson

Prison Fare. 

Another simple meal. Any visitor to one 
of H.M. penitentiaries may have noticed in 
the cells a statement to the effect that " beans 
and bacon" may be substituted for meat, for 
the convicts' dinners, on certain days. "Beans 
and bacon" sounds rural, if not absolutely bucolic. 
" Fancy giving such good food to the wretches ! " 
once exclaimed a lady visitor. But those who 
have sampled the said " beans and bacon " say 
that it is hardly to be preferred to the six ounces 
of Australian dingo or the coarse suet -duff 
(plumless) which furnish the ordinary prison 
dinner. For the table-spoonful of pappy beans 
with which the captive staves off starvation are 
of the genus " haricot " ; and the parallelogram 
of salted hog's-flesh which accompanies the beans 
does not exceed, in size, the ordinary railway 
ticket.

Item, the Potato, earth-apple, murphy, or spud ; 
the most useful, as well as the most exasperating 
gift of a bountiful Providence. Those inclined to 
obesity may skip the greater part of this chapter. 
You can employ a potato for almost anything. 
It comes in very handy for the manufacture of 
starch, .sugar, Irish stew, Scotcb whisky, and 
Colorado beetles. Cut it in half, and with one 
half you restore an old master, and with the other 
drive the cat from the back garden. More deadly 
battles have been waged over the proper way to 
cook a potato, than over a parish boundary, or 
an Irish eviction. Strong-headed men hurl the 



112 CAKES AND ALE 

spud high in air, and receive and fracture it on 
their frontal bones ; whilst a juggler like Paul 
CinquevalH can do what he likes with it. Worn 
inside the pocket, it is an infallible cure for 
chronic rheumatism, fits, and tubercular menin- 
gitis. Worn inside the body it will convert a 
living skeleton into a Daniel Lambert. Plant 
potatoes in a game district, and if they come up 
you will find that after the haulms have withered 
you can capture all your rich neighbour's pheas- 
ants, and half the partridges in the country. A 
nicely-baked potato, deftly placed beneath the 
root of his tail, will make the worst "jibber" in 
the world travel ; whilst, when combined with 
buttermilk, and a modicum of meal, the earth- 
apple has been known to nourish millions of the 
rising generation, and to give them sufficient 
strength and courage to owe their back rents, 
and accuracy of aim for exterminating the brutal 
owner of the soil. 

The waiter, bless ye ! the harmless, flat-footed 
waiter, doesn't know all this. Potatoes to him are 
simply 2d. or 3d. in the little account, according 
to whether they be " biled, mash, or soty " ; and 
if questioned as to the natural history of the 
floury tuber, he would probably assume an air of 
injured innocence, and assure you that during his 
reign of "thirty-five year, man and boy," that 
establishment had "never 'ad no complaints." 

The potato is most eccentric in disposition, 
and its cultivator should know by heart the 
beautiful ode of Horace which commences 

Aequam memento rebus in arduis . . . 



VEGETABLES 113 

The experiences of the writer as a potato 
grower have been somewhat mixed, and oc- 
casionally like the following : — Set your snow- 
flakes in deeply - trenched, heavily - manured 
ground, a foot apart. In due time you will get 
a really fine crop of groundsel, charlock, and 
slugs, with enough bind-weed to strangle the sea- 
serpent. Clear all this rubbish off, and after a 
week or two the eye will be gladdened with the 
sight of the delicate green leaf of the tuber peep- 
ing through the soil. Slow music. Enter the 
Earl of Frost. No ; they will not all be cut ofF. 
You will get one tciber. Peel it carefully, and 
place it in the pig-stye — the peeling spoils the 
quality of the pork. Throw the peeling away — 
on the bed in which you have sown annuals for 
choice — and in the late Spring you will have a 
row of potatoes which will do you credit. 

But this is frivolous. The origin of the 
potato is doubtful ; but that it was used by the 
ancients, in warfare, is tolerably certain. Long 
before the Spaniards reached the New World it 
was cultivated largely by the Incas ; and it was 
the Spaniards who brought the tuber to Europe, in 
the beginning of the sixteenth century. It was 
brought to England from Virginia by Sir John 
Hawkins in 1563 j and again in 1586 by Sir 
Francis Drake, to whom, as the introducer of 
the potato, a statue was erected at OfFenburg, in 
Baden, in 1853. In schools and other haunts of 
ignorance, the credit for the introduction of the 
tuber used to be and is (I believe) still given to 
Sir Walter Raleigh, who has been wrongly 
accredited with as many "good things" as have 



114 CAKES AND ALE 

been Theodore Hook or Sidney Smith. And I 
may mention en parenthese, that I don't entirely 
believe that cloak story. For many years the 
tuber was known in England as the "Batata" — 
overhaul your Lorna Doone-^znA in France, until 
the close cf the eighteenth century, the earth apple 
was looked upon with suspicion, as the cause of 
leprosy and assorted fevers j just as the tomato, 
at the close of the more civilised nineteenth 
century, is said by the vulgar and swine-headed 
to breed cancer. 

Now then, With or without the jacket ? And 
the reader who imagines that I am going to 
answer the question has too much imagination. 
As the old butler in Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone 
observes, there is much to be said on both sides. 
Personally I lean to the " no-jacket " side, unless 
the tuber be baked ; and I would make it penal 
to serve a potato in any other way than boiled, 
steamed, or baked.^ The bad fairy Ala should 
have no hand in its manipulation ; and there be 
few aesthetic eaters who would not prefer the old- 
fashioned " ball of flour " to slices of the sodden 
article swimming in a bath of grease and parsley, 
and called a Saute, The horrible concoction 
yclept "preserved potatoes," which used to be 
served out aboard sailing vessels, after the passen- 
gers had eaten all the real articles, and which 
tasted like bad pease-pudding dressed with furni- 
ture polish, is, happily, deceased. And the best 
potatoes, the same breed which our fathers and 
our forefathers munched in the Covent Garden

The Cabbage is a fine, friendly fellow, who 
make? himself at home, and generally useful, in 
the garden ; whilst his great heart swells, and 
swells, in the full knowledge that he is doing his 
level best to please all. Though cut down in 
the springtime of his youth, his benevolence is so 
great that he will sprout again from his headless 
trunk, if required, and given time for reflection. 
The Romans introduced him into Great Britain, 
but there was a sort of cow-cabbage in the island 
before that time which our blue forefathers used 
to devour with their bacon, and steaks, in a raw 
state. 

"The most evolved and final variety of the 
cabbage," writes a savant^ " is the Cauliflower, 
in which the vegetative surplus becomes poured 
into the flowering head, of which the flowering is 
more or less checked ; the inflorescence becoming 
a dense corymb instead of an open panicle, and 
the majority of the flowers aborting " — the head 
gardener usually tells you all this in the Scottish 
language — "so as to become incapable of pro- 
ducing seed. Let a specially vegetative cabbage 
repeat the excessive development of its leaf paren- 
chyma, and v/e have the wrinkled and .glistered 
Savoy, of which the hardy constitution, but com- 
parative coarseness, become also more intelligible ;

an easily grown and hardy winter variety.

and not from the ordinary cauliflower, a sprouting

In Jersey the cabbage -stalks are dried, var- 
nished, and used as spars for thatched roofs, as 
also for the correction of the youthful population. 
Cook all varieties of the cabbage in water already 
at the boil, with a little salt and soda in it. The 
French sprinkle cheese on a cauliflower, to make 
it more tasty, and it then becomes 

Choufleur au Grat'in, 

Remove the green leaves, and underboil your 
cauliflower. Pour over it some butter sauce in 
which have been mixed two ounces of grated cheese 
— half Gruyere and half Parmesan. Powder with 
bread crumbs, or raspings, and with more grated 
cheese. Lastly, pour over it a teaspoonful of oiled 
butter. Place in a hot oven and bake till the 
surface is a golden brown, which should be in from 
ten to fifteen mmutes. Serve in same dish. 

Vegetarians should be particularly careful to 
soak every description of cabbage in salt and 
water before cooking. Otherwise the vegetarians 
will probably eat a considerable portion of animal 
food. 

Here occurs an opportunity for the recipe for 
an elegant dish, which the French call Perdrix 
aux Choux^ which is simply 

Partridge Stewed with Cabbage^ etc, 

A brace of birds browned in the stewpan with 
butter or good dripping, and a portion of a hand of 
pickled pork in small pieces, some chopped onion 



VEGETABLES 117 

and a clove or two. Add some broth, two carrots 
(chopped), a bay-leaf, and a chopped sausage or two. 
Then add a Savoy cabbage, cut into quarters, and 
seasoned with pepper and salt. Let all simmer 
together for an hour and a half. Then drain the 
cabbage, and place it, squashed down, on a dish. 
Arrange the birds in the middle, surround them 
with the pieces of pork and sausage, and pour over 
all the liquor from the stew. 

This is an excellent dish, and savours more of 
Teutonic than of French cooking. But you 
mustn't tell a Frenchman this, if he be bigger 
than yourself. 

The toothsome Pea has been cultivated in 
the East from time immemorial, though the 
ancient Greeks and Romans do not appear to 
have had knowledge of such a dainty. Had 
Vitellius known the virtues of duck and green 
peas he would probably have not been so wrapt up 
in his favourite dormice, stuffed with poppy-seed 
and stewed in honey. The ancient Egyptians 
knew all about the little pulse, and not one of 
the leaders of society was mummified without a 
pod or two being placed amongst his wrappings. 
And after thousand of years said peas, when 
sown, have been known to germinate. The 
mummy pea-plant, however, but seldom bears 
fruit. Our idiotic ancestors, the ancient Britons, 
knew nothing about peas, nor do any of their 
descendants appear to have troubled about the 
vegetable before the reign of the Virgin Queen. 
Then they were imported from Holland, together 
with schnapps, cura^oa, and other things, and 
no "swagger" banquet was held without a dish 



If 8 CAKES AND ALE 

of "fresh -shelled 'uns," which were accounted 
" fit dainties for ladies, they came so far and cost 
so dear." In England up-to-date peas are 
frequently accompanied by pigeon pie at table ; 
the dove family being especially partial co the 
little pulse, either when attached to the haulm, 
in the garden, or in a dried state. So that the 
crafty husbandman, who possesses a shot gun, 
frequently gathereth both pea and pigeon. A 
chalky soil is especially favourable to pea cultiva- 
tion J and deal sawdust sprinkled well over the 
rows immediately after the setting of the seed 
will frustrate the knavish tricks of the field 
mouse, who also likes peas. The man who 
discovered the affinity between mint and this 
vegetable ought to have received a gold medal, 
and I would gladly attend the execution of the 
caitifF who invented the tinned peas which we 
get at the foreign restaurants, at three times the 
price of the Engfish article. 

Here is a good simple recipe for Pea Soup, 
made from the dried article : 

Soak a quart of split peas in rain-water tor twelve 
hours. Put them in the pot with one carrot, one 
onion, one leek, a sprig or two of parsley (all chopped), 
one pound of streaky bacon, and three quarts of the 
liquor in which either beef, mutton, pork, or poultry- 
may have been boiled. Boil for nearly three hours, 
remove the bacon, and strain the soup through a 
tammy. Heat up, and serve with dried mint, and 
small cubes of fat bacon fried crisp. 

Green-Pea Soup is made in precisely the 
same way ; but the peas will not need soaking 



VEGETABLES 119 

beforehand, and thrifty housewives put in the 
shells as well. 

Harmless and nutritious a vegetable as the 
Bean would appear to be, it did not altogether 
find favour with the ancients. Pythagoras, who 
had quaint ideas on the subject of the human 
soul, forbade his disciples to eat beans, because 
they were generated in the foul ooze out of 
which man was created. Lucian, who had a 
vivid imagination, describes a philosopher in 
Hades who was particularly hard on the bean, 
to eat which he declared was as great a crime 
as to eat one's father's head. And yet Lucian 
was accounted a man of common sense in his 
time. The Romans only ate beans at funerals, 
being under the idea that the souls of the dead 
abode in the vegetable. According to tradition, 
the " caller herrin' " hawked in the streets of 
Edinburgh were once known as " lives o' men," 
from the risks run by the fishermen. And the 
Romans introduced the bean into England by way 
of cheering up our blue forefathers. In the Roman 
festival of Lemuralia, the father of the family was 
accustomed to throw black beans over his head, 
whilst repeating an incantation. This ceremony 
probably inspired Lucian's philosopher — for 
whom, however, every allowance should be made, 
when we come to consider his place of ':esidence 
— with his jaundiced views of the Faba vulgaris. 
Curiously enough, amongst the vulgar folk, at the 
present day, there would seem to be some sort of 
prejudice against the vegetable ; or why should 
" I'll give him beans " be a synonymous threat 
with " I'll do him all the mischief I can ? "

There is plenty of nourishment in a bean ; 
that is the opinion of the entire medical faculty. 
And whilst beans and bacon make a favourite 
summer repast for the farm - labourer and his 
family, the dish is also (at the commencement 
of the bean season) to be met with at the tables 
of the wealthy. The aroma of the flower of the 
broad bean was once compared, in one of John 
Leech's studies in Punchy to " the most delicious 
'air oil," but, apart from this fragrance, there is but 
little sentiment about the Faba vulgaris. A much 
more graceful vegetable is the Phaseolus vulgaris^ 
the kidney, or, as the idiotic French call it, the 
haricot bean. It is just as sensible to call a leg 
of Welsh mutton a pre sale^ or salt meadow. 
No well-behaved hashed venison introduces 
himself to our notice unless accompanied by a 
dish of kidney beans. And few people in Europe 
besides Frenchmen and convicts eat the dried 
seeds of this form of bean, which is frequently 
sown in suburban gardens to form a fence to 
keep out cats. But the suburban cat knows a 
trick worth a dozen of that one ; and no bean 
that was ever born will arrest his progress, or 
turn him from his evil ways. It is criminal to 
smother the kidney bean with melted butter at 
table. A little oil, vinegar, and pepper agree 
with him much better. 

In the great continent of America, the kidney- 
bean seed, dried, is freely partaken of. Pork and 
" Borston " beans, in fact, form the national dish, 
and right good it is. But do not attempt any 
violent exercise after eating the same. The 
Mexicans are the largest bean -eaters in the 



VEGETABLES lai 

world. They fry the vegetables in oil or stew 
them with peppers and onions, and these frijoles 
form the principal sustenance of the lower orders. 
An English " bean feast " (Vulg. beano) is a feast 
at which no beans, and not many other things, are 
eaten. The intelligent foreigner may take it that 
beano simply means the worship of Bacchus. 

With the exception of the onion there is no 
more useful aid to cookery of all sorts than the 
lowly carrot, which was introduced into England 
— no, not by the Romans — from Holland, in the 
sixteenth century. And the ladies who attended 
the court of Charles I. were in the habit of wear- 
ing carrot leaves in the hair, and on their court 
robes, instead of feathers. A similar fashion 
might be revived at the present epoch, with 
advantage to the banking account of vile man. 

As the Flemish gardeners brought over the 
roots, we should not despise carrots cooked in the 
Flemish way. Simmer some young carrots in 
butter, with pepper and salt. Add cream (or 
milk and yolk of eggs), a pinch of sugar, and a 
little chopped parsley. 

H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, according to 
report, invariably eats carrot soup on the 26th of 
August. The French call it " Cr^cy " soup, 
because their best carrots grow there ; and Crecy 
it may be remembered was also the scene of a 
great battle, when one Englishman proved better 
than five Frenchmen. In this battle the Black 
Prince performed prodigies of valour, afterwards 
assuming the crest of the late Bohemian King — 
three ostrich feathers (surely these should be 
parrot tops ?) with the motto " Jch Dien^'' 



iM CAKES AND ALE 

Crecy Soup, 

Place a mirepoix of white wine in the pot, and 
put a quantity of sliced carrots atop. - Moisten with 
broth, and keep simmering till the carrots are done. 
Then pour into a mortar, pound, and pass through 
a tammy. Thin it with more broth, sweeten in 
the proportion of one table-spoonful of sugar to two 
gallons of soup ; heat up, pop a little butter in at the 
finish, and in serving it add either small cubes of fried 
bread, or rice boiled as for curry (see page 145). 



CHAPTER XI 

VEGETABLES — [continued) 

"Earth's simple fruits ; we all enjoy them. 
Then why with sauces rich alloy them ? " 

The brief lives of the best — A vegetable with a pedigree — 
Argenteuil— The Elysian Fields — The tomato the emblem of 
love — " Neeps " — Spinach — " Stomach- brush" — The savoury 
tear-provoker — Invaluable for wasp-stings — Celery merely 
cultivated " smallage " — The " Apium " — The parsnip — O 
Jerusalem ! — The golden sunflower — How to get pheasants — 
A vegetarian banquet — " Swelling wisibly." 

It is one of the most exasperating laws and 
ordinations of Nature that the nicest things shall 
last the shortest time. "Whom the gods love 
die young," is an ancient proverb ; and the pro- 
duce of the garden which is most agreeable to 
man invariably gives out too soon. Look at peas. 
Every gardener of worth puts in the seed so that 
you may get the different rows of marrow-fats and 
telephones and ne plus ultras in " succession " ; 
and up they all come, at one and the same time, 
whilst, if you fail to pick them all at once, the 
combined efforts of mildew and the sun will soon 

K 



124 CAKES AND ALE 

save you the labour of picking them at all. Look 
at strawberries ; and why can't they stay in our 
midst all the year round, like the various members 
of the cabbage family ? 

Then look at Asparagus. The gardener 
who could persuade the heads of this department 
to pop up in succession, from January to 
December would earn more money than the 
Prime Minister. The favourite vegetable of the 
ancient Romans was introduced by them, with 
their accustomed unselfishness, into Britain, where 
it has since flourished — more particularly in the 
alluvial soil of the Thames valley in the neighbour- 
hood of Mortlake and Richmond, ground which 
is also especially favourable to the growth of 
celery. In an ancient work called De Re Rustica^ 
Cato the Elder, who was born 234 B.C., has much 
to say — far more, indeed, than I can translate 
without the aid of a dictionary or " crib " — about 
the virtues and proper cultivation of asparagus ; 
and Pliny, another noble Roman, devotes several 
chapters of his Natural History (published at the 
commencement of the Christian era) to the same 
subject. " Of all the productions of your garden " 
says this Mr. Pliny, " your chief care will be your 
asparagus." And the cheerful and sanguine 
householder of to-day who sows his asparagus, 
and expects to get it " while he waits " has ample 
consolation for disappointment in the reflection 
that his labours will benefit posterity, if not the 
next tenant. 

The foreigners can beat us for size, in the 
matter of asparagus ; but ours is a long way in 
front for flavour. In France the vegetable is 



VEGETABLES 115 

very largely grown at Argenteuil on the Seine, a 
district which has also produced, and still produces, 
a wine which is almost as dangerous to man 
as hydrocyanic acid, and which was invariably 
served in the restaurants, after the sitting had been 
a lengthy one, no matter what special brand 
might have been ordered. English hosts play the 
same game with their " military " ports and 
inferior sherries. The Argenteuil asparagus is 
now grown between the vines — at least 1000 
acres are in cultivation — whence the peculiar flavour 
which, however grateful it may be to Frenchmen, 
is somewhat sickly and not to be compared with 
that of the " little gentleman in Green," nearly 
the whole of whom we English can consume 
with safety to digestion. 

According to Greek mythology, asparagus 
grew in the Elysian fields ; but whether the 
blessed took oil and vinegar with it, or the " bill- 
sticker's paste,'* so favoured in middle -class 
kitchens of to-day, there is no record. It goes 
best, however, with a plain salad dressing — a 
" spot " of mustard worked into a table-spoonful 
of oil, and a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, 
with pepper and salt ad lib. 

Asparagus is no longer known in the British 
pharmacopoeia, but the French make large medi- 
cinal use of its root, which is supposed to still 
the action of the heart, like foxglove, and to act 
as a preventive of calcuH. In cooking the 
vegetable, tie in small bundles, which should be 
stood on end in the saucepan, so that the delicate 
heads should be steamed^ and not touched by the 
boiling water. Many cooks will contest this 



126 CAKES AND ALE 

point i which, however, does not admit of argu- 
ment. 

There was once a discussion in a well-known 
hostelry, as to whether the 

Tomato 

was a fruit or a vegetable. Eventually the head- 
waiter was invited to solve the great question. 
He did so on the spot. 

" Tumarter, sir ? Tumarter's a hextra." 
And as a "hextra" it has never since that 
period ceased to be regarded. A native of South 
America, the plant was introduced into Europe 
by the Spaniards, late in the sixteenth century, 
and the English got it in 1596. Still until a 
quarter of a century ago the tomato has not been 
largely cultivated, save by the market gardener ; 
in fact in private gardens it was conspicuous by 
its absence. Those who eat it do not invariably 
succumb to cancer ; and the dyspeptic should 
always keep it on the premises. As the tomato 
is also known as the " love-apple," a great point 
was missed by our old friend Sergeant Buzfuz, 
in the celebrated Bardell v. Pickwick trial, when 
referring to the postscript, "chops, and tomato 
sauce." Possibly Charles Dickens was not an 

authority on veget I beg pardon, " hextras." 

Here is a French recipe for 

Tomate au Gratin : 

Cut open the tops and scoop out the pulp. Pass 
it through a sieve, to clear away the pips, and mix 
with it either a modicum of butter, or oil, some 
chopped shalot and garlic, with pepper and salt. 



VEGETABLES 127 

Simmer the mixture for a quarter of an hour, then 
stir in some bread-crumbs, previously soaked in broth, 
and some yolks of egg. When cold, fill the tomato 
skins with the mixture, shake some fine bread rasp- 
ings over each, and bake in quick oven for ten or 
twelve minutes. 

The 

Turnip 

is not, as might be sometimes imagined, entirely 
composed of compressed deal splinters, but is a 
vegetable v^^hich was cultivated in India long 
before the Britons got it. The Scotch call 
turnips " neeps " ; but the Scotch w^ill do any- 
thing. Probably no member of the vegetable 
family is so great a favourite w^ith the insect 
pests sent on earth by an all -wise Providence 
to prevent mankind having too much to eat. 
But see that you get a few turnips to cook when 
there is roast duck for dinner. 

Spinach 

was introduced into Spain by the Arabs, and as 
neither nation possessed at that time, at all 
events, the attribute of extra- cleanliness, they 
must have eaten a great deal of " matter in the 
wrong place," otherwise known as dirt. For if 
ever there was a vegetable the preparation of 
which for table would justify any cook in giving 
notice to leave, it is spinach. 

The Germans have nick-named it "stomach- 
brush," and there is no plant growing which 
conduces more to the health of man. But there 
has been more trouble over the proper way to 



i2« CAKES AND ALE 

serve it at table than over Armenia. The French 
chop up their epinards and mix butter, or gravy, 
with the mess. Many English, on the other 
hand, prefer the leaves cooked whole. It is all 
a matter of taste. 

But I seem to scent a soft, sweet fragrance 
in the air, a homely and health -giving reek, 
which warns me that I have too long neglected 
to touch upon the many virtues of the 

Onion. 
Indigenous to India in the form of 

Garlic 

(or gar-leek^ the original onion), the Egyptians 
got hold of the tear-provoker and cultivated it 
2000 years before the Christian era. So that 
few of the mortals of whom we have ever read 
can have been ignorant of the uses of the onion, 
or gar -leek. But knowledge and practice have 
enabled modern gardeners to produce larger bulbs 
than even the most imaginative of the ancients 
can have dreamt of. To mention all the uses 
to which the onion is put in the kitchen would 
be to write a book too weighty for any known 
motive power to convey to the British Museum ; 
but it may be briefly observed of the juice of 
the Cepa that it is invaluable for almost any 
purpose, from flavouring a dish fit to set before 
a king, to the alleviation of the inflammation 
caused by the poison - bearing needle which the 
restless wasp keeps for use within his, or her, tail. 
In fact, the inhabited portion of the globe had 
better be without noses than without onions. 



VEGETABLES 129 

Like the tomato, Celery is a " hextra " — and 
a very important one. If you buy the heads at 
half-a-crown per hundred and sell them at three- 
pence a portion, it will not exercise your calcu- 
lating powers to discover the profits which can 
be made out of this simple root. Celery is 
simply cultivated " smallage " ; a weed which 
has existed in Britain since the age of ice. It 
was the Italians who made the discovery that 
educated smallage would become celery ; and it 
is worthy of note that their forefathers, the 
conquerors of the world, with the Greeks, seem 
to have known " no touch of it " — as a relish, at 
all events ; though some writers will have it that 
the "Apium," with which the victors at the 
Isthmian and other games were crowned was 
not parsley but the leaf of the celery plant. But 
what does it matter ? Celery is invaluable as a 
flavourer, and when properly cultivated, and not 
stringy, a most delightful and satisfactory sub- 
stance to bite. In fact a pretty woman never 
shows to more advantage than when nibbling a 
crisp, " short " head of celery — provided she 
possess pretty teeth. 

With boiled turkey, or ditto pheasant, celery 
sauce is de rigueur ; and it should be flavoured 
slightly with sHces of onion, an ounce of butter 
being allowed to every head of celery. The 
French are fond of it stewed ; and as long as the 
flavour of the gravy, or jus^ does not disguise the 
flavour of the celery, it is excellent when thus 
treated. Its merits in a salad will be touched 
upon in another chapter. 

The Parsnip is a native of England, where 



130 CAKES AND ALE 

it is chiefly used to make an inferior kind of 
spirit, or a dreadful brand of wine. Otherwise 
few people would trouble to cultivate the parsnip ; 
for we can't be having boiled pork or salt 
fish for dinner every day. The Vegetable 
Marrow is a member of the pumpkin family and 
is a comparatively tasteless occupant of the 
garden, its appearance in which heralds the 
departure of summer. In the suburbs, if you 
want to annoy the people next door, you cannot 
do better than put in a marrow plant or two. 
If they come to anything, and get plenty of 
water, they will crawl all over your neighbour's 
premises ; and unless he is fond of the breed, 
and cuts and cooks them, they make him mad. 
The frugal housewife, blessed with a large 
family, makes jam of the surplus marrows ; but 
I prefer a conserve of apricot, gooseberry, or 
greengage. Another purpose to which to put 
this vegetable is — 

Scoop out the seeds, after cutting it in half^ 
lengthways. Fill the space with minced veal 
(cooked), small cubes of bacon, and plenty of season- 
ing — some people add the yoke of an egg — put on 
the other half marrow, and bake for half-an-hour. 

This Baked Marrow is a cheap and homely 
dish which, like many another savoury dish, 
seldom finds its way to the rich man's dining- 
room. 

The Artichoke is a species of thistle ; and 
the man who pays the usual high-toned restaurant 
prices for the pleasure of eating such insipid 
food, is an — never mind what. Boil the thing 



VEGETABLES 131 

in salt and water, and dip the ends of the leaves 
in oil and vinegar, or Holland sauce, before 
eating. Then you will enjoy the really fine 
flavour of the — oil and vinegar, or Holland 
sauce. 

The so-called Jerusalem Artichoke is 
really a species of sunflower. Its tuber is not a 
universal favourite, though it possesses far from a 
coarse flavour. The plant has nothing whatever 
to do with Jerusalem, and never had. Put a 
tuber or two into your garden, and you will 
have Jerusalem artichokes as long as you live on 
those premises. For the vegetable will stay with 
you as long as the gout, or the rate-gatherer. 
Pheasants are particularly partial to this sort of 
crop. 

By far the best vegetable production of the 
gorgeous East is the 

Brtnjal 

'Tis oval in shape, and about the size of a hen's 
egg, the surface being purple in colour. It is 
usually cut in twain and done " on the grating " ; 
I have met something very like the hrinjal in 
Covent Garden ; but can find no record of the 
vegetable's pedigree in any book. 

Although there are still many vegetarian 
restaurants in our large towns, the prejudice 
against animal food is, happily, dying out ; and 
if ridicule could kill, we should not hear much 
more of the "cranks" who with delightful 
inconsistency, would spurn a collop of beef, 
and gorge themselves on milk, in every shape 
and form. If milk, butter, and cheese be not 



132 CAKES AND ALE 

animal food I should like to know what is? 
And it is as reasonable to ask a man to sustain 
life on dried peas and mushrooms as to feed a 
tiger on cabbages. 

Once, and only once, has the writer attempted a 

Vegetarian Banquet, 

It was savoury enough ; and possessed the 
additional merit of being cheap. Decidedly 
" filling at the price " was that meal. We — I 
had a messmate — commenced with (alleged) 
Scotch broth — which consisted principally of 
dried peas, pearl barley, and oatmeal — and a large 
slice of really excellent brown bread was served, 
to each, with this broth. Thereupon followed a 
savoury stew of onions and tomatoes, relieved by 
a "savoury pie," apparently made from potatoes, 
leeks, bread crumbs, butter, and "postponed" 
mushrooms. We had "gone straight" up to now, 
but both shied a bit at the maccaroni and grated 
cheese. We had two bottles of ginger beer 
apiece, with this dinner, which cost less than 
three shillings for the two, after the dapper little 
waitress had been feed. On leaving, we both 
agreed to visit that cleanly and well-ordered 
little house again, if only from motives of 
economy ; but within half an hour that pro- 
gramme was changed. 

Like the old lady at the tea-drinking, I 
commenced to " swell wisibly " ; and so did my 
companion. 

"Mon alive ! " he gasped. " I feel just for all 
the wor-rld like a captive balloon, or a puffy- 



VEGETABLES 



133 



dunter — that's a puffing whale, ye ken. Til 
veesit yon onion-hoose nae mair i' ma life ! " 

And I think it cost us something like half a 
sovereign in old brandy to neutralise the effects 
of that vegetarian banquet. 



CHAPTER XII 



CURRIES 

" Thou com'st in such a questionable shape 
That I will speak to thee." 

Different modes of manufacture — The "native" fraud — "That 
man's family " — The French kari — A Parsee curry — " The 
oyster in the sauce " — Ingredients — Malay curry — Locusts — 
When to serve — What to curry — Prawn curry — Dry curry, 
a champion recipe — Rice — The Bombay duck. 

The poor Indian grinds his coriander seeds, green 
ginger, and other ingredients between two large 
flat stones ; taking a whiff at the family " hubble- 
bubble" pipe at intervals. The frugal British 
housewife purchases (alleged) curry powder in 
the warehouse of Italy — where it may have lived 
on, like Claudian, " through the centuries " — 
stirs a spoonful or two into the hashed mutton, 
surrounds it with a wall of clammy rice, and calls 
it Benares Curry, made from the recipe of a 
very dear uncle who met his death while tiger- 
shooting. A.nd you will be in the minority if 
you do not cut this savoury meat with a knife, 
and eat potatoes, and very often cabbage, with 



CURRIES 135 

it. The far-seeing eating-house keeper corrals a 
Lascar or a discharged Mehtar into the firm, 
gives him his board, a pound a month, and a 
clean puggaree and Kurnmerhund daily, and "stars " 
him in the bill as an " Indian chef^ fresh from the 
Chowringhee Club, Calcutta." And it is part 
of the duties of this Oriental — supposed by the 
unwary to be at least a prince in his native land 
— to hand the portions of curry, w^hich he may 
or may not have concocted, to the appreciative 
guests, who enjoy the repast all the more from 
having the scent of the Hooghly brought across 
the footlights. I was once sadly and solemnly 
reproved by the head waiter of a very " swagger " 
establishment indeed for sending away, after one 
little taste, the (alleged) curry which had been 
handed me by an exile from Ind, in snow-white 
raiment. 

"You really ought to have eaten that, sir," 
said the waiter, " for that man's family have been 
celebrated curry-makers for generations." 

I smole a broad smile. In the Land of the 
Moguls the very babies who roll in the dust 
know the secret of curry -making. But that 
" that man " had had any hand in the horrible 
concoction placed before me I still resolutely 
decline to believe. And how can a man be 
cook and waiter at the same time ? The " native 
curry-maker," depend on it, is more or less of a 
fraud ; and his aid is only invoked as an excuse 
for overcharging. 

At the Oriental Club are served, or used to be 
served, really excellent curries, assorted ; for as 
there be more ways than one of killing a cat, so 



n6 CAKES AND ALE 

are there more curries than one. The French 
turn out a horrible mixture, with parsley and 
mushrooms in it, which they call kari ; it is 
called by a still worse name on the Boulevards, 
and the children of our lively neighbours are 
frequently threatened with it by their nurses. 

On the whole, the East Indian method is the 
best ; and the most philanthropic curry I ever 
tasted was one which my own Khtt?nughar had 
just prepared, with infinite pains, for his own 
consumption. The poor heathen had prospected 
a feast, as it was one of his numerous " big 
days " ; so, despising the homely dhal^ on the 
which, with a plate of rice and a modicum of 
rancid butter, he was wont to sustain existence, 
he had manufactured a savoury mess of pottage, 
the looks of which gratified me. So, at the risk 
of starting another Mutiny, it was ordained that 
the slave should serve the refection at the table 
of the " protector of the poor." And a pukkha 
curry it was, too. Another dish of native 
manufacture with which the writer became 
acquainted was a 

Parsee Curry, 

The eminent firm of Jehangeer on one occasion 
presented a petition to the commanding-officer 
that they might be allowed to supply a special 
curry to the mess one guest-night. The request 
was probably made as an inducement to some of 
the young officers to pay a little on account of 
their " owings " to the firm ; but it is to be 
feared that no special vote of thanks followed the 
sampling of that special curry. It was a curry I 



CURRIES 137 

I tasted it for a week (as the Frenchman did 
the soup of Swindon) ; and the Parsee chef 
must have upset the entire contents of the spice- 
box into it. I never felt more like murder than 
when the hotel cook in Manchester put nutmeg 
in the oyster sauce ; but after that curry, the 
strangling of the entire firm of Jehangeer would, 
in our cantonments, at all events, have been 
brought in "justifiable homicide." 

" Oyster sauce " recalls a quaint simile I once 
heard a bookmaker make use of. He was talking 
of one of his aristocratic debtors, whom he de- 
scribed as sure to pay up, if you could only get 
hold of him. " But mark you," continued the 
layer of odds, "he's just about as easy to get 
hold of as the oyster in the sauce^ at one of our 
moonicipal banquets ! " But return we to our 
coriander seeds. There is absolutely no reason 
why the frugal housewife in this country should 
not make her own curry powder from day to 
day, as it may be required. Here is an average 
Indian recipe ; but it must be remembered that 
in the gorgeous East tastes vary as much as 
elsewhere, and that Bengal, Bombay, Madras 
(including Burmah), Ceylon, and the Straits 
Settlements, have all different methods of pre- 
paring a curry. 

A few coriander and cumin seeds — according to 
taste — eight peppercorns, a small piece of turmeric, 
and one dried chili, all pounded together. 

When making the curry mixture, take a piece of 
the heart of a cabbage, the size of a hen's egg ; chop 
it fine and add one sour apple in thin slices the size 
of a Keswick codlin, the juice of a medium-sized 



138 CAKES AND ALE 

lemon, a saltspoonful of black pepper, and a table- 
spoonful of the above curry powder. Mix all well 
together ; then take six medium-sized onions which 
have been chopped small and fried a delicate brown, 
a clove of garlic, also chopped small, two ounces of 
fresh butter, two ounces of flour, and one pint of 
beef gravy. Boil up this lot (which commences 
with the onions), and when boiling stir in the rest of 
the mixture. Let it all simmer down, and then 
add the solid part of the curry, i.e. the meat, cut 
in portions not larger than two inches square. 

Remember, O frugal housewife, that the 
turmeric portion of the entertainment should be 
added with a niggard hand. "Too much tur- 
meric" is the fault which is found with most 
curries made in England. I remember, when a 
boy, that there was an idea rooted in my mind 
that curries were made with Doctor Gregory's 
Powder, an unsavoury drug with which we were 
periodically regaled by the head nurse ; and there 
was always a fierce conflict at the dinner-table 
when the bill-of-fare included this (as we supposed) 
physic-al terror. But it was simply the taste of 
turmeric to which we took exception. 

What is Turmeric ? A plant in cultivation 
all over India, whose tubers yield a deep yellow 
powder of a resinous nature. This resinous 
powder is sold in lumps, and is largely used for 
adulterating mustard ; just as inferior anchovy 
sauce is principally composed of Armenian Bole, 
the deep red powder with which the actor makes 
up his countenance. Turmeric is also used 
medicinally in Hindustan, but not this side of 
Suez, although in chemistry it affords an in- 



CURRIES 139 

fallible test for the presence of alkalies. The 
Coriander has become naturalised in parts of 
England, but is more used on the Continent. 
Our confectioners put the seeds in cakes and 
buns, also comfits, and in Germany, Norway, 
Sweden, and (I fancy) Russia, they figure in 
household bread. In the south of England, 
coriander and caraway seeds are sown side by 
side, and crops of each are obtained in alternate 
years. The coriander seed, too, is largely used 
with that of the caraway and the cumin, for 
making the liqueur known as Kummel. 

Cumin is mentioned in Scripture as something 
particularly nice. The seeds are sweet-savoured, 
something like those of the caraway, but more 
potent. In Germany they put them into bread, 
and the Dutch use them to flavour their cheeses. 
The seeds we get in England come principally 
from Sicily ^nd Malta. 

And now that my readers know all about the 
ingredients of curry-powder — it is assumed that 
no analysis of the chili, the ginger-root, or the 
peppercorn, is needed — let them emulate the pupils 
of Mr. Wackford Squeers, and " go and do it." 

Another Recipe for curry-powder includes 
fenugreek, cardamoms, allspice, and cloves ; but 
I verily believe that this was the powder used in 
that abominable Parsee hell-broth, above alluded 
to, so it should be cautiously approached, if at all. 
" Fenugreek " sounds evil ; and I should say a 
curry compounded of the above ingredients 
would taste like a "Number One" pick-me-up. 
Yet another recipe (Doctor Kitchener's) 
specifies six ounces of coriander seed, five ounces 



140 CAKES AND ALE 

of turmeric [ower muckle^ Pth of ope en ion) two 
ounces each of black pepper and mustard seed 
{ochone !\ half an ounce of cumin seed, half an 
ounce of cinnamon {donner und hlit%en!\ and 
one ounce of lesser cardamoms. All these things 
are to be placed in a cool oven, kept therein one 
night, and pounded in a marble mortar next 
morning, preparatory to being rubbed through a 
sieve. " Kitchener " sounds like a good cooking 
name ; but, with all due respect, I am not going 
to recommend his curry-powder. 

A Malay curry is made with blanched 
almonds, which should be fried in butter till 
hghtly browned. Then pound them to a paste 
with a sliced onion and some thin lemon-rind. 
Curry powder and gravy are added, and a small 
quantity of cream. The Malays curry all sorts 
of fish, flesh, and fowl, including the young 
shoots of the bamboo — and nice tender, succulent 
morsels they are. At a hotel overlooking the 
harbour of Point de Galle, Ceylon, "run," at 
the time of the writer's visit, by a most convivial 
and enterprising Yankee, a cunning concocter of 
all sorts of " slings " and " cocktails," there used 
to be quite a plethora of curries in the bill-of-fare. 
But for a prawn curry there is no place like the 
City of Palaces. And the reason for this super- 
excellence is that the prawns — but that story had, 
perhaps, best remain untold. 

Curried Locusts formed one of the most 
eccentric dishes ever tasted by the writer. There 
had come upon us that day a plague of these all- 
devouring insects. A few billions called on us, 
in our kitchen gardens, in passing j and whilst 



Curries ui 

they ate up every green thing — including the 
newly-painted wheelbarrow, and the regimental 
standard, which had been incautiously left out of 
doors — our faithful blacks managed to capture 
several impis of the marauding scuts, in revenge ; 
and the mess-cook made a right savoury plat of 
their hind-quarters. 

It is criminal to serve curry during the entree 
period of dinner. And it is worse form still to 
hand it round after gooseberry tart and cream, 
and trifle, as I have seen done at one great house. 
In the land of its birth, the spicy pottage invari- 
ably precedes the sweets. Nubbee Bux marches 
solemnly round with the mixture, in a deep dish, 
and is succeeded by Ram Lai with the rice. 
And in the Madras Presidency, where dry curry 
is served as well as the other brand, there is a 
procession of three brown attendants. Highly- 
seasoned dishes at the commencement of a long 
meal are a mistake ; and this is one of the reasons 
why I prefer the middle cut of a plain-boiled 
Tay salmon, or the tit-bit of a lordly turbot, or 
a flake or two of a Grimsby cod, to a sole 
Normande^ or a red mullet stewed with garlic, 
mushrooms, and inferior claret. I have even met 
homard a V Americaine^ during the fish course, at 
the special request of a well-known Duke. The 
soup, too, eaten at a large dinner should be as 
plain as possible ; the edge being fairly taken ofF 
the appetite by such concoctions as bisque^ bouilla- 
baisse^ and mulligatawny — all savoury and tasty 
dishes, but each a meal in itself. Then I main- 
tain that to curry whitebait is wrong ; partly 
because curry should on no account be served 



H* CAKES AND ALE 

before roast and boiled, and partly because the 
flavour of the whitebait is too delicate for the 
fish to be clad in spices and onions. The lesson 
which all dinner-givers ought to have learnt from 
the Ancient Romans — the first people on record 
who went in for aesthetic cookery — is that highly- 
seasoned and well-peppered dishes should figure 
at the end, and not the commencement of a 
banquet. Here follows a list of some of the 
productions of Nature which it is allowable to 
curry. 

What to Curry, 

TuRBOT. Sole. Cod. 

Lobster. Crayfish. Prawns, — but not the so- 
called "Dublin Prawn," which is delicious when 
eaten plain boiled, but no good in a curry. 

Whelks.^ Oysters. Scallops. 

Mutton. Veal. Pork. Calf's Head. Ox Palate. 
Tripe.^ 

Eggs. Chicken. Rabbit (the " bunny " lends itself 
better than anything else to this method of cooking). 
Pease. Kidney Beans. ^ Vegetable Marrow. 
Carrots. Parsnips. Bamboo Shoots. Locust 
Legs. 

A mistaken notion has prevailed for some time 
amongst men and women who write books, that 
the Indian curry mixture is almost red-hot to the 
taste. As a matter of fact it is of a far milder 
nature than many I have tasted " on this side." 
Also the Anglo-Indian does not sustain life 
entirely on food flavoured with turmeric and garlic. 
In fact, during a stay of seven years in the

CURRIES 143 

gorgeous East, the writer's experience was that 
not one in ten touched curry at the dinner table. 
At second breakfast — otherwise known as "tiffin" 
— it was a favoured dish ; but the stuff prepared 
for the meal of the day — or the bulk thereof — 
usually went to gratify the voracious appetite of 
the ^^ mehters^"* the Hindus who swept out the 
mess-rooms, and whose lowness of "caste" 
allowed them to eat " anything." An eccentric 
meal was the mehter's dinner. Into the empty 
preserved-meat tin which he brought round to 
the back door I have seen emptied such assorted 
pahulwn as mock turtle soup, lobster salad, plum 
pudding and custard, curry, and (of course), the 
surplus vilolif'y and in a few seconds he was 
squatting on his heels, and spading into the 
mixture with both hands. 

In the Bengal Presidency cocoanut is freely 
used with a curry dressing ; and as some men have 
as great a horror of this addition, as of oil in a 
salad, it is as w^ell to consult the tastes of your 
guests beforehand. 

A Prawn Curry I have seen made in 
Calcutta as follows, the proportions of spices, 
etc., being specially written down by a munshi : — 

Pound and mix one table-spoonful of coriander 
seed, one table-spoonful of poppy seed, a salt-spoonful 
of turmeric, half a salt-spoonful of cumin seed, a pinch 
of ground cinnamon, a ditto of ground nutmeg, a small 
lump of ginger, and one salt-spoonful of salt. Mix 
this with butter, add two sliced onions, and fry till 
lightly browned. Add the prawns, shelled, and pour 
in the milk of a cocoanut. Simmer for twenty 
minutes, and add some lime juice. 



144 CAKES AND ALE 

But the champion of curries ever sampled by 
the writer was a dry curry — a decided improve- 
ment on those usually served in the Madras 
Presidency — and the recipe (which has been 
already published in the Sporting Times and 
Lady^s Pictorial)^ only came into the writer's 
possession some years after he had quitted the 
land of temples. 

Dry Curry, 

I lb. of meat (mutton, fowl, or white fish). 
I lb. of onions. 

1 clove of garlic. 

2 ounces of butter. 

I dessert-spoonful of curry powder. 

I dessert-spoonful of curry paste. 

I dessert-spoonful of chutnee (or tamarind pre- 
serve, according to taste). 

A very little casareep, which is a condiment (only 
obtainable at a few London shops) made from the juice 
of the bitter cassava, or manioc root. Casareep is the 
basis of that favourite West Indian dish " Pepper-pot." 

Salt to taste. 

A good squeeze of lemon juice. 

First brown the onions in the butter, and then 
dry them. Add the garlic, which must be mashed 
to a pulp with the blade of a knife. Then mix the 
powder, paste, chutnee, and casareep into a thin paste 
with the lemon juice. Mash the dried onions into 
this, and let all cook gently till thoroughly mixed. 
Then add the meat, cut into small cubes, and let all 
simmer very gently for three hours. This sounds a 
long time, but it must be remembered that the recipe 
is for a dry curry ; and when served there should be 
no liquid about it. 

'Tis a troublesome dish to prepare ; but, 



CURRIES 145 

judging from the flattering communications 
received by the writer, the Heges would seem to 
Hke it. And the mixture had better be cooked 
in a double or porridge-saucepan, to prevent any 
" catching." 

Already, in one of the breakfast chapters, has 
the subject of the preparation of rice, to be served 
with curry, been touched upon ; but there will 
be no harm done in giving the directions again. 

Rice for Curry 

Soak a sufficiency of rice in cold water until by 
repeated strainings all the dirt is separated from it. 
Then put the rice into boiling water, and let it 
"gallop" for nine or ten minutes — no longer. Strain 
the water off through a colander, and dash a little 
cold water over the rice to separate the grains. Put 
in a hot dish, and serve immediately. 

A simple enough recipe, surely ? So let us 
hear no more complaints of stodgy, clammy, 
" puddingy " rice. Most of the cookery books 
give far more elaborate directions, but the above 
is the method usually pursued by the poor brown 
heathen himself. 

Soyer*s recipe resembles the above ; but, after 
draining the water from the cooked rice, it is re- 
placed in the saucepan, the interior of which has 
in the interim been anointed with butter. The 
saucepan is then placed either near the fire (not 
on it), or in a slow oven, for the rice to swell. 

Another way: 

After washing the rice, throw it into plenty of 
boiling water — in the proportion of six pints of water 



146 CAKES AND ALE 

to one pound of rice. Boil it for five minutes, and 
skim it; then add a wine-glassful of milk for every 
half pound of rice, and continue boiling for five 
minutes longer. Strain the water off through a 
colander, and put it dry into the pot, on the corner 
of the stove, pouring over the rice a small piece of 
butter, which has been melted in a table-spoonful of 
the hot milk and water in which the rice was boiled. 
Add salt, and stir the rice for five minutes more. 

The decayed denizen of the ocean, dried to the 
consistency of biscuit, and known in Hindustan 
as a Bombay Duck, which is frequently eaten 
with curry, "over yonder," does not find much 
favour, this side of Port Said, although I have 
met the fowl in certain city restaurants. The 
addition is not looked upon with any particular 
favour by the writer. 

" I have yet to learn " once observed that great 
and good man, the late Doctor Joseph Pope,^ to 
the writer, in a discussion on " postponed " 
game, " that it is a good thing to put corruption 
into the human stomach."

CHAPTER XIII 



SALADS 

** O green and glorious, O herbaceous meat ! 
'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat. 
Back, to the world he'd turn his weary soul. 
And dip his fingers in the salad bowl ! " 

Nebuchadnezzar v. Sydney Smith — Salt? — No salad-bowl — French 
origin — Apocryphal story of Francatelli — Salads and salads 
— Water-cress and dirty water — Salad-maker born not made 
— Lobster salad — Lettuce, Wipe or wash ? — Mayonnaise — 
Potato salad — Tomato ditto — Celery ditto — A memorable 
ditto. 

If Sydney Smith had only possessed the experience 
of old King Nebuchadnezzar, after he had been 
" turned out to grass," the witty prebend might 
not have waxed quite so enthusiastic on the 
subject of "herbaceous meat." Still the subject 
is a vast and important one, in its connection 
with gastronomy, and lends itself to poetry far 
easier than doth the little sucking pig, upon 
whom Charles Lamb expended so great and 
unnecessary a wealth of language. 

But look at the terse, perfunctory, and far 
from satisfactory manner in which the Ency- 



14? CAKES AND ALE 

clopadia attacks the subject. "Salad," we read, 
" is the tef m given to a preparation of raw herbs 
for food. It derives its name from the fact that 
salt is one of the chief ingredients used in dressing 
a salad." This statement is not only misleading 
but startling ; for in the " dressing " of a salad it 
would be the act of a lunatic to make salt the 
" chief ingredient." 

Long before they had learnt the art of dress- 
ing the herbs, our ancestors partook of cresses 
(assorted), celery, and lettuces, after being soaked 
in water for a considerable period ; and they 
dipped the raw herbs into salt before consuming 
them. In fact, in many a cheap eating-house 
of to-day, the term " salad " means plain lettuce, 
or cress, or possibly both, absolutely undressed — 
in a state of nature, plus plenty of dirty water. 
Even the English cook of the end of the nine- 
teenth century cannot rid himself, or herself, of 
the idea that lettuce, like water-cress, knows the 
running brook, or the peaceful pond, as its 
natural element. And thirty years before the 
end of that century, a salad bowl was absolutely 
unknown in nine-tenths of the eating-houses of 
Great Britain. 

There is no use in blinking the fact that it 
is to our lively neighbours that we owe the 
introduction of the salad proper. Often as the 
writer has been compelled, in these pages, to 
inveigh against the torturing of good fish and 
flesh by the alien cook, and the high prices 
charged for its endowment with an alien flavour, 
let that writer (figuratively) place a crown of 
endive, tipped with baby onions, upon the brows 



SALADS 149 

of the philanthropist who dressed the first salad, 
and gave the recipe to the world. That recipe 
has, of course, been improved upon ; and although 
the savant who writes in the Encylop^dia pro- 
claims that "salad has always been a favourite 
food with civilised nations, and has varied very 
little in its composition," the accuracy of both 
statements is open to question. 

" Every art," observes another writer, " has its 
monstrosities ; gastronomy has not been behind- 
hand ; and though he must be a bold man who 
will venture to blaspheme the elegancies of 
French cookery, there comes a time to every 
Englishman who may have wandered into a 
mistaken admiration of sophisticated messes, 
when he longs for the simple diet of his native 
land, and vows that the best cookery in the 
world, and that which satisfies the most refined 
epicureanism, sets up for its ideal — plainness of 
good food, and the cultivation of natural tastes." 

And yet the French have taught us, or tried to 
teach us, how to prepare a dish of raw herbs, in 
the simplest way in the world ! 

"Now a salad," says the same writer, "is 
simplicity itself, and here is a marvel— it is the 
crowning grace of a French dinner, while, on the 
other hand, it is little understood and villainously 
treated at English tables." Ahem ! I would 
qualify that last statement. At some English 
tables I have tasted salads compared with which 
the happiest effort of the ^/f^ deserves not to be 
mentioned in the same garlic-laden breath. And 
"garlic- laden breath" naturally reminds me of 
the story of Francatelli — of which anecdote I do 



I50 CAKES AND ALE 

not believe one word, by the way. It was said 
of Franc, whilst chef 2X the Reform Club, that 
his salads were such masterpieces, such things of 
beauty, that one of the members questioned him 
on the subject. 

" How do you manage to introduce such a 
dehcious flavour into your salads ? " 

" Ah ! that should be my secret," was the 
reply. " But I will tell him to you. After I have 
made all my preparations, and the green food is 
mixed with the dressing, I chew a little clove of 
garlic between my teeth — so — and then breathe 
gently over the whole." 

But, as observed before, I do not believe that 
garlic story. 

O salad, what monstrosities are perpetrated in 
thy name ! Let the genteel boarding-house 
cook-maid, the young lady who has studied 
harmony and the higher mathematics at the 
Board School, spread herself over the subject ; 
and then invite the angels to inspect the matter, 
and weep ! For this is the sort of " harmony " 
which the "paying guest," who can appreciate 
the advantages of young and musical society, an 
airy front bed-chamber, and a bicycle room, is ex- 
pected to enthuse over at the table d'hote: a melange 
of herbs and roots, including water-cress and giant 
radishes, swimming in equal parts of vinegar and 
oil, and a large proportion of the water in which 
the ingredients have been soaking for hours — said 
ingredients being minced small, Hke veal collops, 
with a steel knife. And the same salad, the very 
identical horror, obtrudes itself on the table at 
other genteel establishments than boarding-houses. 



SALADS 151 

For they be "mostly fools" who people the 
civilised world. 

Let it be laid down as a golden rule, that the 
concoction of a salad should never, or hardly ever, 
be entrusted to the tender mercies of the British 
serving-maid. For the salad-maker, like the poet, 
is born, not made ; and the divine afflatus — I 
don't mean garlic — is as essential in the one as 
in the other. We will take the simple mixture, 
what is commonly known as the 

French Salad^ 

first. This is either composed, in the matter of 
herbs, of lettuce, chopped taragon, chervil, and 
chives ; or of endive, with, " lurking in the bowl," 
a chapon^ or crust of bread on which a clove of 
garlic has been rubbed. But the waiter, an he 
be discreet, will ask the customer beforehand if 
he prefer that the chapon be omitted. The dress- 
ing is simplicity itself: 

Within the bowl of a table-spoon are placed, in 
succession, a spot of made mustard, and a sprinkling 
of black pepper and salt. The bowl is filled up with 
vinegar, and with a fork in the other hand the waiter 
stirs quickly the mustard, etc., afterwards emptying 
the contents of the spoon over the green-stuff. Then 
the spoon is refilled — either twice or thrice, ad lib. — 
with Lucca oil, which is also poured over the salad. 
Then the final mixing takes place, in the salad bowl. 

But there be many and elaborate ways of salad- 
making. Here is the writer's idea of a 

Lobster Salad 
for half-a-dozen guests : 



t52 CAKES ANt) Alt 

In a soup plate, mix the yolks of two hard-boiled 
eggs — boiled for thirty minutes, and afterwards 
thrown into cold water — into a smooth paste with a 
teaspoonful of made mustard, and a table-spoonful ot 
plain vinegar, added drop by drop. Keep on stirring, 
and add a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, a few 
drops of essence of anchovies, a teaspoonful {not 
heaped') of salt, about the same quantity of sifted 
sugar, and a good pinch of cayenne. [The tendency 
of black pepper is to make a salad gritty, which is 
an abomination.] Lastly, add, drop by drop, three 
table -spoonfuls of oil. Pour this dressing (which 
should be in a continual state of stir) into your salad 
bowl. Add the pickings of a hen lobster cut into 
dice, and atop of the lobster, lettuces which have 
been shred with clean fingers, or with ivory forks ; 
a little endive may be added, with a slice or two 
of beetroot ; but no onion (or very little) in a 
lobster salad. A few shreds of anchovy may be 
placed atop ; with beetroot cut into shapes, the 
whites of the eggs, and the coral of the lobster, for the 
sake of effect ; but seek not, O student, to achieve 
prettiness of effect to the detriment of practical 
utility. I need hardly add that the sooner after its 
manufacture a salad is eaten, the better will be its 
flavour. And the solid ingredients should only be 
mixed with the dressing at the very last moment ; 
otherwise a sodden, flabby effect will be produced, 
which is neither pleasing to the eye, nor calculated 
to promote good digestion. 

I am perfectly aware that the above is not a 
strict Mayonnaise dressing, in which the egg 
yolks should be raw, instead of cooked. But, 
like the Scotsman, I have " tried baith," and pre- 
fer my own way, which more resembles the 
sauce Tartare^ than the Mayonnaise of our lively 



SALAt)S 153 

neighbours, who, by the way, merely wipe, in- 
stead of wash, their lettuces and endive, to 
preserve, as they say, the flavour. Of course 
this is a matter of taste, but the writer must own 
to a preference for the baptised article, which must, 
however, on no account be left to soak, but be 
simply freed from dirt, grit, and — other things. 

What is the origin of the word "Mayon- 
naise " ? No two Frenchmen will give you the 
same answer. " Of or belonging to Mayonne '* 
would seem to be the meaning of the word ; but 
then there is no such place as Mayonne in the 
whole of France. Grimod de la Reyniere main- 
tained that the proper word was " Bayonnaise," 
meaning a native of Bayonne, on the Spanish 
frontier. Afterwards Grimod, who was a 
resourceful man, got hold of another idea, and 
said that the word was probably "Mahonnaise," 
and so named in honour of Marshal Richelieu's 
capture of the stronghold of Mahon^ in the 
island of Minorca. But what h^d this victory 
got to do with a salad dressing ? What was the 
connection of raw eggs and tarragon vinegar with 
Marshal Richelieu ? Then up came another 
cook, in the person of Careme, who established 
it as an absolute certainty that the genuine word 
was " Magnonnaise," from the word " manier^'' 
to manipulate. But as nobody would stand this 
definition for long, a fresh search had to be 
made ; and this time an old Provencal verb was 
dug up — mahonner^ or more correctly maghonner^ 
t-o worry or fatigue. And this is now said 
by purists to be the source of Mayonnaise — 
"something worried," or fatigued. And the 



154 CAKES AND ALE 

reason for the gender of the noun is said to be 
that in ancient times lovely woman was accus- 
tomed to manipulate the salad with her own fair 
fingers. In the time of Rousseau, the phrase 
retourner la salade avec les doigts was used to 
describe a woman as being still young and 
beautiful ; just as in Yorkshire at the present 
time, " she canna mak' a bit o' bread " is used to 
describe a woman who is of no possible use in the 
house. So a Mayonnaise or a Mahonnaise — I care 
not which be the correct spelling — was a young 
lady who " fatigued " the salad. More shame to 
the gallants of the day, who allowed " fatigue " 
to be associated with youth and beauty ! 

But can it possibly matter what the word 
means, when the mixture is smooth and savoury ; 
and so deftly blended that no one flavour 
predominates ? And herein lies the secret or 
every mixture used for the refreshment of the 
inner man and woman ; whether it be a soup, 
a curry, a trifle, a punch, or a cup — no one 
ingredient should be of more weight or im- 
portance than another. And that was the secret 
of the " delicious gravy " furnished by the cele- 
brated stew at the "Jolly Farmers," in The 
Old Curiosity Shop of Charles Dickens. 

Mayonnaise (we will drop for the nonce, 
the other spelHng) is made thus : 

In the proportions of two egg yolks to half a 
pint of Lucca oil, and a small wine-glassful of tarragon 
vinegar. Work the yolks smooth in a basin, with a 
seasoning of pepper (cayenne for choice), salt, and 
— according to the writer's views — sifted sugar. 
Then a few drops of oil, and fewer of vinegar ; 



SALADS 155 

stirring the mixture all the time, from right to left, 
with a wooden, or ivory, spoon. In good truth 'tis 
a " fatiguing " task ; and as in very hot weather the 
sauce is liable to decompose, or " curdle," before the 
finishing touches are put to it, it may be made over 
ice. 

" Stir, sisters, stir. 
Stir with care ! '* 

is the motto for the Afayonnaise-mlxer. And 
in many cases her only reward consists in the 
knowledge that through her art and patience 
she has helped to make the sojourn of others 
in this vale of tears less tearful and monotonous. 
" Onion atoms " should " lurk within the 
bowl," on nearly every occasion, and as for a 
potato salad — don't be afraid, I'm not going to 
quote any more Sydney Smith, so don't get 
loading your guns — well, here is the proper way 
to make it. 

Potato Salad. 

Cut nine or ten average-sized kidney potatoes 
(cooked) into slices, half an inch thick, put them in 
a salad bowl, and pour over them, after mixing, two 
table-spoonfuls of vinegar, one table-spoonful of tarra- 
gon vinegar, six table-spoonfuls of oil, one of minced 
parsley, a dessert-spoonful of onions chopped very 
fine, with cayenne and salt to taste. Shredded 
anchovies may be added, although it is preferable 
without ; and this salad should be made a couple of 
hours or so before partaken of. 

The German recipe for a potato salad is too 
nasty to quote -, and their Herring Salad, 
although said to be a valuable restorative of nerve 



156 CAKES AND ALE 

power, by no means presents an attractive ap- 
pearance, when served at table. Far more to 
the mind and palate of the average epicure is a 

Tomato Salad, 
This is the author's recipe : 

Four large tomatoes and one Spanish onion, cut 
mto thin slices. Mix a spot of mustard, a little 
white pepper and salt, with vinegar, in a table-spoon, 
pour it over the love apples, etc., and then add two 
table-spoonfuls of oil. Mix well, and then sprinkle 
over the mixture a few drops of Lea and Perrins's 
Worcester Sauce. For the fair sex, the last part of 
the programme may be omitted, but on no account 
leave out the breath of sunny Spain. And mark 
this well. The man, or woman, who mixes tomatoes 
with lettuces, or endives, in the bowl, is hereby 
sentenced to translate the whole of this book into 
Court English. 

Celery Salad. 

An excellent winter salad is made with beetroot 
and celery, cut in thin slices, and served — with or 
without onions — either with a mayonnaise sauce, or 
with a plain cream sauce : to every table-spoonful of 
cream add a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, a little 
sugar, and a suspicion of cayenne. This salad looks 
best served in alternate slices of beet and celery, on 
a flat silver dish, around the sauce. 

J Gentleman Salad Maker. 

Although in the metropoHs it is still custom- 
ary, in middle-class households, to hire "outside 
help" on the occasion of a dinner-party, we ha^'c 



SALADS 



157 



not heard for some time of a salad-dresser who 
makes house-to-house visitations in the exer- 
cise of his profession. But, at the end of the 
1 8th century, the Chevaher d'Allignac, who 
had escaped from Paris to London in the evil 
days of the Revolution, made a fortune in this 
way. He was paid at the rate of ^5 a salad, and 
naturally, soon started his own carriage, "in 
order that he might pass quickly from house to 
house, during the dining hours of the aristo- 
cracy." High as the fee may appear to be, it is 
impossible to measure the width of the gulf 
which lies between the salad as made by a lover 
of the art, and the kitchen-wench ; and a perfect 
salad is, like a perfect curry, " far above rubies." 

A Memorable Salad 

was once served in my own mansion. The 
dxef^ who understood these matters well, when 
her hair was free from vine leaves, had been 
celebrating her birthday or some other festival ; 
and had mixed the dressing with Colza oil. Her 
funeral was largely attended.

It has, I hope, been made sufficiently clear that

dressed salad ; from the which I would also exclude 
such " small deer " as mustard and cress. There 
is, however, no black mark against the narrow- 
leaved Corn Salad plant, or " lamb's lettuce " ; 
and its great advantage is that it can be grown 
almost anywhere during the winter months, when 
lettuces have to be " coddled," and thereby robbed 
of most of their flavour. 

Instead of yolk of egg, in a dressing, cheese may 
be used, with good results, either cream cheese — not 
the poor stuff made on straws, but what are known as 
"napkin," or "New Forest" cheeses — or Cheddar.

Squash it well up with oil and vinegar, and do not 
use too much. A piece of cheese the size of an 
average lump of sugar will be ample, and will lend 
a most agreeable flavour to the mixture. 

Roman Salad 

Lucullus and Co. — or rather their cooks — 
had much to learn in the preparation of the 
" herbaceous meat " which delighted Sydney 
Smith. The Romans cultivated endive ; this 
was washed free from "matter in the wrong 
place," chopped small — absolutely fatal to the 
taste — anointed with oil and liquamen^ topped up 
with chopped onions, and further ornamented 
with honey and vinegar. But before finding 
fault with the conquerors of the world for mixing 
honey with a salad, it should be remembered that 
they knew not " fine Demerara," nor " best lump," 
nor even the beet sugar which can be made at 
home. Still I should not set a Roman salad 
before my creditors, if I wanted them to have 
" patience." An offer of the very smallest dividend 
would be preferable. 

Italian Salad, 

The merry Italian has improved considerably 
upon the herbaceous treat (I rather prefer " treat " 
to "meat") of his ancestors ; though he is far 
too fond of mixing flesh-meat of all sorts with his 
dressed herbs, and his boiled vegetables. Two 
cold potatoes and half a medium sized beet sliced, 
mixed with boiled celery and Brussels sprouts, 
form a common salad in the sunny South ; the 
dressing being usually oil and vinegar, occasionally 



i6o CAKES AND ALE 

oil seule^ and sometimes a Tar tare sauce. Stoned 
olives are usually placed atop of the mess, which 
includes fragments of chicken, or veal and ham. 

Russian Salad, 

This is a difficult task to build up ; for a sort 
of Cleopatra's Needle, or pyramid, of cooked 
vegetables, herbs, pickles, etc., has to be erected 
on a flat dish. Carrots, turnips, green peas, 
asparagus, French beans, beetroot, capers, pickled 
cucumbers, and horse-radish, form the soHd 
matter of which the pyramid is built. 

Lay a stratum on the dish, and anoint the stratum 
with Tartare sauce. Each layer must be similarly 
anointed, and must be of less circumference than the 
one underneath, till the top layer consists of one 
caper. Garnish with bombs of caviare, sliced lemon, 
crayfish, olives, and salted cucumber ; and then give 
the salad to the policeman on fixed-point duty. At 
least, if you take my advice. 

Anchovy Salad, 

This is usually eaten at the commencement 
of dinner, as a hors d^oeuvre. 

Some shreds ot anchovy should be arranged 
"criss-cross" in a flat glass dish. Surround it with 
small heaps of chopped trufiles, yolk and white of 
hard-boiled eggs, capers, and a stoned olive or two. 
Mix all the ingredients together with a little Chili 
vinegar, and twice the quantity of oil. 

The mixture is said to be invaluable as an 
appetiser ; but the modest oyster on the deep 
shell — if he has not been fattened at the bolt-hole 
of the main sewer — is to be preferred. 



SALADS AND CONDIMENTS i6i 

Cooked vegetables, for salad purposes, are not, 
nor will they ever be, popular in England, Nine 
out of ten Britains will eat the " one sauce " 
with asparagus, in preference to the oiled butter, 
or plain salad dressing, of mustard, vinegar, 
pepper, salt, and oil ; whilst 'tis almost hopeless 
to attempt to dissuade madame the cook from 
smothering her cauliflowers with liquefied paste, 
before sending them to table. Many a wild weed 
which foreign nations snatch greedily from the 
soil, prior to dressing it, is passed by with scorn 
by our islanders, including the dandelion, which 
is a favourite of our Hvely neighbours, for salad 
purposes, and is doubtless highly beneficial to the 
human liver. So is the cauliflower ; and an 
eminent medical authority once gave out that the 
man who ate a parboiled cauliflower, as a salad, 
every other day, need never send for a doctor. 
Which sounds rather like fouling his own nest. 

Fruit Salad, 

This is simply a French compote of cherries, 
green almonds, pears, limes, peaches, apricots in 
syrup slightly flavoured with ginger ; and goes 
excellent well with any cold brown game. Try it. 

Orange Salad. 

Peel your orange, and cut it into thin slices. 
Arrange these in a glass dish, and sugar them well. 
Then pour over them a glass of sherry, a glass of 
brandy, and a glass of maraschino. 

Orange Sauce. 
Cold mutton, according to my notions, is 



1 62 CAKES AND ALE 

"absolutely beastly," to the palate. More happy 
homes have been broken up by this simple dish 
than by the entire army of Europe. And 'tis 
a dish which should never be allowed to wander 
outside the servants' hall. The superior domestics 
who take their meals in the steward's room, would 
certainly rise in a body, and protest against the 
indignity of a cold leg, or shoulder. As for a 
cold loin — but the idea is too awful. Still, 
brightened up by the following condiment, cold 
mutton will go down smoothly, and even grate- 
fully : — 

Rub off the thin yellow rind of two oranges on 
four lumps of sugar. Put these into a bowl, and 
pour in a wine-glass of port, a quarter pint of dis- 
solved red -currant jelly, a teaspoonful of mixed 
mustard — don't be frightened, it's all right — a finely- 
minced shallot, a pinch of cayenne, and some more 
thin orange rind. Mix well. When heated up, 
strain and bottle off. 

But amateur sauces should, on the whole, be 
discouraged. The writer has tasted dozens of 
imitations of Lea and Perrins's " inimitable," and 
it is still inimitable, and unapproachable. It is the 
same with chutnee. You can get anything in 
that line you want at Stembridge's, close to 
Leicester Square, to whom the writer is indebted 
for some valuable hints. But here is a recipe 
for a mixture of chutnee and pickle, which must 
have been written a long time ago ; for the two 
operations are transposed. For instance, the 
07iions should be dealt with first.

Chutnine. 

Ten or twelve large apples, peeled and cored, put 
in an earthenware jar, with a little vinegar (on no 
account use water) in the oven. Let them remain 
till in a pulp, then take out, and add half an ounce 
of curry powder, one ounce of ground ginger, half a 
pound of stoned raisins, chopped fine, half a pound 
moist sugar, one teaspoonful cayenne pepper, one 
table-spoonful salt. Take four large onions {this 
should be do?ie jirst\ chop very line, and put them in 
a jar with a pint and a half of vinegar. Cork tightly 
and let them remain a week. Then add the rest 
of the ingredients, after mixing them well together. 
Cork tightly, and the chutnine will be ready for 
use in a month. It improves, however, by keeping 
for a year or so. 

R.aw Chutnee 

is another aid to the consumption of cold meat, 
and I have also seen it used as an accom- 
paniment to curry, but do not recommend the 
mixture. 

One large tomato, one smaller Spanish onion, one 
green chili, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Pulp 
the tomato ; don't try to extract the seeds, for life 
is too short for that operation. Chop the onion and 
the chili very fine, and mix the lot up with a pinch 
of salt, and the same quantity of sifted sugar. 

I know plenty of men who would break up 
their homes (after serving the furniture in the 
same way) and emigrate ; who would go on 
strike, were roast beef to be served at the dinner- 
table unaccompanied by horse-radish sauce. But 
this is a relish for the national dish which is 
frequently overlooked.

Horse-radish Sauce. 

Grate a young root as fine as you can. It is 
perhaps needless to add that the fresher the horse- 
radish the better. No vegetables taste as well 
as those grown in your own garden, and gathered, 
or dug up, just before wanted. And the horse- 
radish, like the Jerusalem artichoke, comes to 
stay. When once he gets a footing in your 
garden you will never dislodge him j nor will 
you want to. Very well, then : 

Having grated your horse, add a quarter of a pint 
of cream — English or Devonshire — a dessert-spoonful 
of sifted sugar, half that quantity of salt, and a table- 
spoonful of vinegar. Mix all together, and, if for 
hot meat, heat in the oven, taking care that the 
mixture does not curdle. Many people use oil 
instead of cream, and mix grated orange rind with 
the sauce. The Germans do not use oil, but either 
make the relish with cream, or hard-boiled yolk of 
egg. Horse-radish sauce for hot meat may also be 
heated by pouring it into a jar, and standing the 
jar in boiling water — "jugging it" in fact. 

Celery Sauce^ 

for boiled pheasant, or turkey, is made thus : 

Two or three heads of celery, sliced thin, put 
into a saucepan with equal quantities of sugar and 
salt, a dust of white pepper, and two or three ounces 
of butter. Stew your celery slowly till it becomes 
pulpy, but not brown^ add two or three ounces of flour, 
and a good half- pint of milk, or cream. Let it 
simmer twenty minutes, and then rub the mixture 
through a sieve.

The carp as an item or food is, according to 
my ideas, a fraud. He tastes principally of the 
mud in which he has been wallowing until 
dragged out by the angler. The ancients loved 
a dish of carp, and yet they knew not the only 
sauce to make him at all palatable. 

Sauce for Carp, 

One ounce of butter, a quarter pint of good beef 
gravy, one dessert-spoonful of flour, a quarter pint 
of cream and two anchovies chopped very small. 
Mix over the fire, stir well till boiling, then take off, 
add a little Worcester sauce, and a squeeze of lemon, 
just before serving. 

Christopher North's Sauce, 

This is a very old recipe. Put a dessert-spoonful 
of sifted sugar, a salt-spoonful of salt, and rather 
more than that quantity of cayenne, into a jar. Mix 
thoroughly, and add, gradually, two table-spoonfuls of 
Harvey's sauce, a dessert -spoonful of mushroom 
ketchup, a table-spoonful of lemon juice, and a large 
glass of port. Place the jar in a saucepan of boiling 
water, and let it remain till the mixture is very hot, 
but not boiling. If bottled directly after made, the 
sauce will keep for a week, and may be used for 
duck, goose, pork, or (Christopher adds) " any broil." 
But there is but one broil sauce, the Gubbins Sauce, 
already mentioned in this work. 

Sauce for Hare. 

What a piece of work is a hare ! And what 
a piece of work it is to cook him in a laudable 
fashion ! 

Crumble some bread — a handful or so — soak it

Serve as hot as possible. 

Mackerel is a fish but seldom seen at the tables 
of the great. And yet 'tis tasty eating, if his 
Joseph's coat be bright and shining when you 
purchase him. When stale he is dangerous to 
life itself. And he prefers to gratify the human 
palate when accompanied by 

Gooseberry Sauce^ 

which is made by simply boiling a few green goose- 
berries, rubbing them through a sieve, and adding a 
little butter and a suspicion of ginger. Then heat 
up. "A wine-glassful of sorrel or spinach-juice," 
observes one authority, "is a decided improvement." 
H'm. I've tried both, and prefer the gooseberries 
unadorned with spinach liquor. 

Now for a sauce which is deservedly popular 
all over the world, and which is equally at home 
as a salad dressing, as a covering for a steak off a 
fresh-run salmon, or a portion of fried eel; the 
luscious, the invigorating 

Sauce Tartare^ 

so called because no tallow- eating Tartar was 
ever known to taste thereof. I have already 
given a pretty good recipe for its manufacture, 
in previous salad-dressing instructions, where the 
yolks of hard-boiled eggs are used. But chopped 
chervil, shallots, and (occasionally) gherkins, are 
added to the Tartare arrangement ; and frequently

pint of water, for a few minutes, and pour over 
them a cupful of finely grated crumbs. Let them 
soak well, then beat up with a fork, and stir in about 
a gill of oiled butter. Add two table-spoonfuls of the 
brown gravy made for the pig, a glass of port, and a 
pinch of salt. Stir the sauce well over the fire. It 
is also occasionally served with roast venison ; but 
not in the mansions of my friends.

Put two ounces of green sage leaves into a jar with

fortnight, then pour off the liquid into a tureen ; 
or boil with some good gravy. This sauce will keep 
for a week or two, bottled and well corked up. 

And now, having given directions for the 
manufacture of sundry "cloyless sauces" — with 
only one of the number having any connection 
with Jla^ and that one a sauce of world-wide 
reputation, I will conclude this chapter with a 
little fancy work. It is not probable that many 
who do me the honour to skim through these 
humble, faultily-written, but heartfelt gastronomic 
hints are personally acquainted with the cloyless

who is a lady of dusky origin. But let us quit 
metaphor, and direct the gardener to 

Cut the finest and straightest cucumber in his

remainder into two-inch lengths. Peel these, and 
let them repose in salt to draw out the water, which 



SALADS AND CONDIMENTS 169 

is the indigestible part of the cucumber. ^ Then 
take each length, in succession, and with a very 
sharp knife — a penknife is best for the purpose — 
pare it from surface to centre, until it has become 
one long, curly shred. Curl it up tight, so that it 
may resemble in form the spring of a Waterbury 
watch. Cut the length through from end to end, 
until you have made numerous long thin shreds. 
Treat each length in the same way, and place in a 
glass dish. Add three green chilies, chopped fine, 
a few chopped spring onions, and some tiny shreds 
of the Blue Fish of Java. Having performed a fish- 
less pilgrimage in search of this curiosity, you will 
naturally fall back upon the common or Italian 
anchovy, which, after extracting the brine and bones, 
and cleansing, chop fine. Pour a little vinegar over 
the mixture. 

" Sambal " will be found a delicious accompani- 
ment to curry — when served on a salad plate — 
or to almost any description of cold meat and 
cheese. It is only fair to add, however, that the 
task of making the relish is arduous and exasper- 
ating to a degree ; and that the woman who 
makes it — no male Christian in the world is 
possessed of a tithe of the necessary patience, 
now that Job and Robert Bruce are no more — 
should have the apartment to herself. For the 
labour is calculated to teach an entirely new 
language to the manufacturer. 



CHAPTER KV 



SUPPER 

" We are such stuff 
As dreams are made of." 

Cleopatra's supper — Oysters — Danger in the Aden bivalve- 
Oyster stew — Ball suppers — Pretty dishes — The Tuj Mahal 
— Aspic — Bloater paste and whipped cream — Ladies' recipes 
— Cookery colleges — Tripe — Smothered in onions — North 
Riding fashion — ^An hotel supper — Lord Tomnoddy at the 
" Magpie and Stump." 

That cruel and catlike courtesan, Cleopatra, is 
alleged to have given the most expensive supper 
on record, and to have disposed of the bonne louche 
herself, in the shape of a pearl, valued at the 
equivalent of ^250,000, dissolved in vinegar of 
extra strength. Such a sum is rather more than 
is paid for a supper at the Savoy, or the Cecil, 
or the Metropole, in these more practical times, 
when pearls are to be had cheaper ; and there is 
probably about as much truth in this pearl story 
as in a great many others of the same period. I 
have heard of a fair declassee leader of fashion at 
Monte Carlo, who commanded that her major 
domo should be put to death for not having 



SUPPER 171 

telegraphed to Paris for peaches, for a special 
dinner ; but the woman who could melt a pearl 

in vinegar, and then drink halte la ! Perhaps 

the pearl was displayed in the deep shell of the 
oyster of which the " noble curtesan '* partook ? 
We know how Mark Antony's countrymen valued 
the succulent bivalve ; and probably an oyster 
feast at Wady Haifa or Dongola was a common 
function long before London knew a " Scott's," 
a " Pimm's," or a " Sweeting's." 

Thanks partly to the "typhoid scare," but 
principally to the prohibitive price, the "native" 
industry of Britain has been, at the latter end 
of the nineteenth century, by no means active, 
although in the illustrated annuals Uncle John 
still brings with him a barrel of the luscious 
bivalves, in addition to assorted toys for the 
children, when he arrives in the midst of a 
snow-storm at the old hall on Christmas Eve. 
But Uncle John, that good fairy of our youth, 
when Charles Dickens invented the "festive 
season," and the very atmosphere reeked of 
goose-stuffing, resides, for the most part, "in 
Sheffield," in these practical days, when sentiment 
and goodwill to relatives are rap-idly giving place 
to matters of fact, motor cars, and mammoth 
rates. 

The Asiatic oyster is not altogether commend- 
able, his chief merit consisting in his size. Once 
whilst paying a flying visit to the city of Kurachi, 
I ordered a dozen oysters at the principal hotel. 
Then I went out to inspect the lions. On my 
return I could hardly push my way into the 
cofFee-room. It was full of oyster ! There was 



I7Z CAKES AND ALE 

no room for anything else. In fact one Kurachi 
oyster is a meal for four full-grown men. 

More tragic still was my experience of the 
bivalves procurable at Aden — which cinder-heap 
I have always considered to be a foretaste of even 
hotter things below. Instead of living on coal- 
dust (as might naturally be expected) the Aden 
oyster appears to do himself particularly well on 
some preparation of copper. The only time I 
tasted him, the after consequences very nearly 
prevented my ever tasting anything else, on 
this sphere. And it was only the comfort 
administered by the steward of my cabin which 
got me round. 

"Ah ! " said that functionary, as he looked in 
to see whether I would take hot pickled pork 
or roast goose for dinner. " The last time we 
touched at Aden, there was two gents 'ad 'ysters. 
One of 'em died the same night, and the other 
nex' mornin'." 

I laughed so much that the poison left my 
system. 

Yet still we eat oysters — the Sans Bacilles 
brand, for choice. And if we can only persuade 
the young gentleman who opens the bivalves to 
refrain from washing the grit off each in the tub 
of dirty water behind the bar, so much the better. 
And above all, the bivalves should be opened on 
the deep shell, so as to conserve some of the juice ; 
for it is advisable to get as much of the bivalve 
as we can for the money. Every time I crunch 
the bones of a lark I feel that I am devouring an 
oratorio, in the way of song ; and whilst the 
bivalve is sliding down the " red lane " it may 



SUPPER 173 

be as well to reflect that " there slips away 
fourpence " ; or, as the Scotsman had it, " bang 
went saxpence ! " 

In connection with Mr. Bob Sawyer's supper 
party in Pickwick^ it may be recollected that " the 
man to whom the order for the oysters had been 
sent had not been told to open them ; it is a very 
difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp knife 
or a two-pronged fork : and very little was done 
in this way." 

And in one's own house, unless there be an 
adept at oyster-opening present, the simplest way 
to treat the bivalve is the following. It should 
be remembered that a badly-opened oyster will 
resemble in flavour a slug on a gravel walk. 
So roast him, good friends, in his own fortress. 

Oysters in their own Juice, 

With the tongs place half-a-dozen oysters, mouths 
outwards, between the red-hot coals of the parlour 
or dining-room fire — the deep shell must be at the 
bottom — and the oysters will be cooked in a few 
minutes, or when the shells gape wide. Pull them 
out with the tongs, and insert a fresh batch. No 
pepper, vinegar, or lemon juice is necessary as an 
adjunct ; and the oyster never tastes better. 

At most eating-houses, 

Scalloped Oysters 

taste of nothing but scorched bread-crumbs ; and 
the reason is obvious, for there is but little else 
in the scallop shell. Natives only should be used. 

Open and beard two dozen, and cut each bivalve 



174 CAKES AND ALE 

in half. Melt two ounces of butter in a stewpan, 
and mix into it the same allowance of flour, the 
strained oyster liquor, a teacupful of cream, half a 
teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, and a pinch of 
cayenne — death to the caitiff who adds nutmeg — 
and stir the sauce well over the fire. Take it off, 
and add the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, a table- 
spoonful of finely chopped parsley, and a teaspoonful 
of lemon juice. Put in the oysters, and stir the 
whole over a gentle fire for five minutes. Put the 
mixture in the shells, grate bread-crumbs over, place a 
small piece of butter atop, and bake in a Dutch oven 
before a clear fire until the crumbs are lightly browned, 
which should be in about a quarter of an hour. 

Oyster Stew 

is thoroughly understood in New York City. 
On this side, the dish does not meet with any 
particular favour, although no supper-table is 
properly furnished without it. 

Open two dozen oysters, and take the beards off. 
Put the oysters into a basin and squeeze over them 
the juice of half a lemon. Put the beards and the 
strained liquor into a saucepan with half a blade of 
mace, half a dozen peppercorns ground, a little grated 
lemon rind, and a pinch of cayenne. Simmer gently 
for a quarter of an hour, strain the liquid, thicken it 
with a little butter and flour, add a quarter of a pint 
(or a teacupful) of cream, and stir over the fire till 
quite smooth. Then put in the oysters, and let 
them warm through — they must not boil. Serve in 
a soup tureen, and little cubes of bread fried in bacon 
grease may be served with the stew, as with pea-soup. 

Be very careful to whose care you entrust 
your barrel, or bag, of oysters, after you have got 



SUPPER 175 

them home. A consignment or the writer's

mas Eve, consigned to the back dairy, by Matilda

disappointment, disagreeable language. 

Ball Suppers. 

More hard cash is wasted on these than even 
on ball dresses, which is saying a great deal. The 
alien caterer, or charcutier^ is chiefly to blame 
for this ; for he it is who has taught the British 
matron to wrap up wholesome food in coats of 
grease, inlaid with foreign substances, to destroy 
its flavour, and to bestow upon it an outward 
semblance other than its own. There was 
handed unto me, only the other evening, what I 
at first imagined to be a small section of the 
celebrated Taj Mahal at Agra, the magnificent 
mausoleum of the Emperor Shah Jehan. Refer- 
ence to the bill-of-fare established the fact that I 
was merely sampling a galantine of turkey, 
smothered in some white glazy grease, inlaid 
with chopped carrot, green peas, truffles, and 
other things. And the marble column (also 
inlaid) which might have belonged to King 
Solomon's Temple, at the top of the table, turned 
out to be a Tay salmon, decorated a la mode de 
charcutter^ and tasting principally of garlic. A 
shriek from a fair neighbour caused me to turn 
my head in her direction j and it took some 
little time to discover, and to convince her, that 
the item on her plate was not a mouse, too 
frightened to move, but some preparation of the 
liver of a goose, in " aspic." 



176 CAKES AND ALE 

This said Aspic — which has no connection 
with the asp which the fair Cleopatra kept on 
the premises, although a great French lexico- 
grapher says that aspic is so called because it is 
as cold as a snake — is invaluable in the numerous 
" schools of cookery " in the which British 
females are educated according to the teaching 
of the bad fairy Ala, The cold chicken and 
ham which delighted our ancestors at the supper- 
table — what has become of them ? Yonder, my 
dear sir, is the fowl, in neat portions, minced, 
and made to represent fragments of the almond 
rock which deHghted us whilst in the nursery. 
The ham has become a ridiculous mousse^ placed 
in little accordion-pleated receptacles of snow- 
white paper ; and those are not poached eggs 
atop, either, but dabs of whipped cream with a 
preserved apricot in the centre. 

It was only the other day that I read in a 
journal written by ladies for ladies, of a dainty 
dish for luncheon or supper : croutons smeared 
with bloater paste and surmounted with whipped 
cream ; and in the same paper was a recipe for 
stuffing a fresh herring with mushrooms, parsley, 
yolk of egg, onion, and its own soft roe. I am 
of opinion that it was a bad day for the male 
Briton when the gudewife, with her gude- 
daughter, and her gude cook, abandoned the 
gude roast and boiled, in favour of the works of 
the all-powerful Ala. 

And now let us proceed to discuss the most 
homely supper of all, and when I mention the 
magic word 



SUPPER 177 

Tripe 

there be few of my readers who will not at once 
allow that it is not only the most homely of 
food, but forms an ideal supper. This doctrine 
had not got in its work, however, in the 'sixties, 
at about which period the man who avowed 
himself an habitual tripe-eater must have been 
possessed of a considerable amount of nerve. 
Some of the supper-houses served it — such as 
the Albion, the Coal Hole, and more particu- 
larly, " Noalces's," the familiar name for the old 
Opera Tavern which used to face the Royal 
ItaHan Opera House, in Bow Street, Covent 
Garden. But the more genteel food-emporiums 
fought shy of tripe until within three decades of the 
close of the nineteenth century. Then it began 
to figure on the supper bills, in out-of-the-way 
corners ; until supper-eaters in general discovered 
that this was not only an exceedingly cheap, but 
a very nourishing article of food, which did not 
require any special divine aid to digest. Then 
the price of tripe went up 75 per cent on the 
programmes. Then the most popular burlesque 
artiste of any age put the stamp of approval upon 
the new supper-dish, and tripe-dressing became 
as lucrative a profession as gold-crushing. 

There is a legend afloat of an eminent actor 
— poor " Ned " Sothern, I fancy, as " Johnny " 
Toole would never have done such a thing — 
who bade some of his friends and acquaintance 
to supper, and regaled them on sundry rolls 
of house flannel, smothered with the orthodox 
onion sauce. But that is another story.

Practical jokes should find no place in this

How to Cook Tripe, 

Ask for "double-tripe," and see that the dresser 
gives it you nice and white. Wash it, cut into 
portions, and place in equal parts of milk and water, 
boiling fast. Remove the saucepan from the hottest 
part of the fire, and let the tripe keep just on the 
boil for an hour and a half. Serve with whole 
onions and onion sauce — in this work you will not 
be told how to manufacture onion sauce — and 
baked potatoes should always accompany this dish to 
table. 

Some people like their tripe cut into strips 
rolled up and tied with cotton, before being 
placed in the saucepan ; but there is really no 
necessity to take this further trouble. And if 
the cook should forget to remove the cotton before 
serving, you might get your tongues tied in 
knots. In the North Riding of Yorkshire, 
some of the farmers* wives egg-and-bread- 
crumb fillets of tripe, and fry them in the drip 
of thick rashers of ham which have been fried 
previously. The ham is served in the centre 
of the dish, with the fillets around the pig-pieces. 
This is said to be an excellent dish, but 1 
prefer my tripe smothered in onions, like the 
timid "bunny." 

Edmund Yates, in his "Reminiscences," de- 
scribes " nice, cosy, Httle suppers," of which in his 
early youth he used to partake, at the house of his 
maternal grandfather, in Kentish Town. " He 



SUPPER 179 

dined at two o'clock," observed the late pro- 
prietor of the World^ "and had the most de- 
lightful suppers at nine ; suppers of sprats, or 
kidneys, or tripe and onions ; with foaming 
porter and hot grog afterwards." 

I cannot share the enthusiasm possessed by- 
some people for Sprats, as an article of diet. 
When very "full-blown," the little fish make 
an excellent fertiliser for Marshal Niel roses j 
but as " winter whitebait," or sardines they are 
hardly up to " Derby form." 

Sprats are not much encouraged at the 
fashionable hotels ; and when tripe is brought 
•to table, which is but rarely, that food is nearly 
always filleted, sprinkled with chopped parsley, 
and served with tomato sauce. 

This is the sort of supper which is provided in 
the " gilt-edged " caravanserais of the metropolis, 
the following being a verbatim copy of a bill of 
fare at the Hotel Cecil : — 

SouPER, 55. 

Consomme Riche en tasses. 

Laitances Frites, Villeroy. 

C6te de Mouton aux Haricots Verts. 

Chaudfroid dc Mauviettes. Strasbourg evisie. 

Salade. 

Biscuit Cecil. 

A lady-like repast this ; and upon the whole, 
not dear. But roast loin of mutton hardly 
sounds tasty enough for a meal partaken of 
somewhere about the stroke of midnight. Still, 
such a supper is by no means calculated to 
"murder sleep." Upon the other hand it is a 



i8o CAKES AND ALE 

little difficult to credit the fact that the whole of 
the party invited by " My Lord Tomnoddy " to 
refresh themselves at the "Magpie and Stump," 
including the noble host himself, should have 
slumbered peacefully, with a noisy crowd in the 
street, after a supper which consisted of 

" Cold fowl and cigars, 
Pickled onions in jars, 
Welsh rabbits and kidneys, 
Rare work for the jaws.'* 



CHAPTER XVI 



SUPPER [continued) 

" To feed were best at home ; 
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony ; 
Meeting were bare without it." 

Old supper-houses — The Early Closing Act — Evans's — Cremorne 
Gardens — The " Albion " — Parlour cookery — Kidneys fried 
in the fire-shovel — The true way to grill a bone — " Cannie 
Carle " — My lady's bovver — Kidney dumplings — A Middle- 
ham supper — Steaks cut from a colt by brother to " Strafford " 
out of sister to " Bird on the Wing." 

The Early Closing Act of 1872 had a disastrous 
effect upon the old London supper - houses. 
What Mr. John Hollingshead never tired of 
calling the " slap-me-and-put-me-to-bed law" 
rang the knell of many a licensed tavern, well- 
conducted, where plain, well -cooked food and 
sound liquor were to be obtained by men who 
would have astonished their respective couches 
had they sought them before the small hours. 

Evans*s, 

The " Cave of Harmony " or Thackeray was 
a different place to the " Evans's " of my youth- 



i?2 CAKES AND ALE 

fill days. Like the younger Newcome, I was 
taken there in the first instance, by the author 
of my being. But Captain Costigan was con- 
spicuous by his absence; and "Sam Hall" was 
mn est. I noted well the abnormal size of the 
broiled kidneys, and in my ignorance of anatomy, 
imagined that Evans's sheep must be subjected 
to somewhat the same process — the "ordeal by 
fire" — as the Strasbourg geese. And the 
potatoes — zounds, sirs ! What potatoes ! " Shall I 
turn it out, sir ? " inquired the attentive waiter ; 
and, as he seized the tuber, enveloped in the snow- 
white napkin, broke it in two, and ejected a 
floury pyramid upon my plate, I would, had I 
known of such a decoration in those days, have 
gladly recommended that attendant for the Dis- 
tinguished Service order. In the course of many 
visits I never saw any supper commodity served 
here besides chops, steaks, kidneys, welsh-rarebits, 
poached eggs, and (I think) sausages ; and the 
earliest impression made upon a youthful memory 
was the air of extreme confidence which pervaded 
the place. We certainly "remembered" the 
waiter ; but not even a potato was paid for until 
we encountered the head functionary at the exit 
door ; and his peculiar ideas of arithmetic would 
have givfin Bishop Colenso a succession of fits. 

Who *' Evans " was, we neither knew nor 
cared. "Paddy" Green, with his chronic 
smile, was enough for us ; as he proffered his 
ever-ready snufF-box, inquired after our relatives 
— " Paddy," like " Spanky " at Eton, knew every- 
body — and implored silence whilst the quintette 
Integer Vitte was being sung by the choir. We 



SUPPER 183 

used to venerate that quintette far more than any 
music we ever heard in church, and I am certain 
" Paddy " Green would have backed his little 
pack of choristers — who, according to the general 
belief, passed the hours of daylight in waking the 
echoes of St. Paul's Cathedral, or Westminster 
Abbey, and therefore, at Evans's, always looked 
a bit stale and sleepy — against any choir in the 
world. As for Harry Sidney, the fat, jolly-looking 
gentleman who was wont to string together the 
topics of the day and reproduce them, fresh as 
rolls, set to music, we could never hear enough 
of him ; and I wish I had now some of the half- 
crowns which in the past were bestowed upon 
Herr Von Joel, the indifferent siffieur^ who was 
"permanently retained upon the premises," and 
who was always going to take a benefit the 
following week. 

"Kidneys and 'armony" — that was the old 
programme in the " Cave." And then the march 
of time killed poor old Paddy, and another 
management reigned. Gradually the "lady 
element " was introduced, and a portion of the hall 
was set apart for the mixed assembly. And then 
came trouble, and, finally, disestablishment. And 
for some time before the closing of the Cave as 
a place of entertainment, it was customary to 
remove the fine old pictures (what became of 
them, I wonder), from the walls, at "'Varsity 
Boat Race " time. For the undergraduate of those 
days was nothing if not rowdy. Youth will have 
its fling ; and at Evans's the fling took the form 
of tumblers. Well do I recollect a fight in " the 
old style " in the very part of the " Cave " where 



i84 CAKES AND ALE 

eminent barristers, actors, and other wits of a 
past age, used to congregate. The premier boxer 
of Cambridge University had been exercising his 
undoubted talents as a breaker of glass, during 
the evening, and at length the overwrought 
manager obliged him with an opponent worthy of 
his fists in the person of a waiter who could also 
put up his fists. Several rounds were fought, 
strictly according to the rules of the Prize Ring, 
and in the result, whilst the waiter had sustained 
considerable damage to his ribs, the " Cambridge 
gent " had two very fine black eyes. Well do I 
remember that "mill," also the waiter, who 
afterwards became an habitual follower of the 
turf. 

If Cremorne introduced the fashion of " long 
drinks," sodas, and et ceteras, the suppers served 
in the old gardens had not much to recommend 
them. A slice or two of cold beef, or a leg 
of a chicken, with some particularly salt ham, 
formed the average fare ; but those who possessed 
their souls with patience occasionally saw some- 
thing hot, in the way of food — chiefly cutlets. 
The great virtue of the cutlet is that it can be 
reheated ; and one dish not infrequently did 
duty for more than one party. The rejected 
portion, in fact, would " reappear " as often as a 
retiring actor. " I know them salmon cutlets," 
the waiter in Pink Dominoes used to observe, "as 
well as I know my own mother ! " In fact, 
Cremorne, like the " night houses " of old, was 
not an ideal place to sup at. 

But, per contra^ the " Albion " was. Until 
the enforcement of the "slap-me-and-put-me-to- 



SUPPER 185 

bed " policy there was no more justly celebrated 
house of entertainment than the one which 
almost faced the stage door of Drury Lane 
theatre, in Great Russell Street. One of the 
brothers Cooper — another kept the Rainbow in 
Fleet Street — retired on a fortune made here, 
simply by pursuing the policy of giving his 
customers the best of everything. And a rare, 
Bohemian stamp of customers he had, too — a 
nice, large-hearted, open-handed lot of actors, 
successful and otherwise, dramatic critics ditto, 
and ditto journalists, also variegated in degree -, 
with the usual, necessary, leavening of the 
" City " element. The custom of the fair sex 
was not encouraged at the old tavern ; though 
in a room on the first floor they were per- 
mitted to sup, if in " the profession *' and accom- 
panied by males, whose manners and customs 
could be vouched for. In winter time, assorted 
grills, of fish, flesh, and fowl, were served as 
supper dishes ; whilst tripe was the staple food. 
Welsh rarebits, too, were in immense demand. 
And I think it was here that I devoured, with 
no fear of the future before my plate, a 

Buck Rarebit. 

During the silent watches of the rest of the 
morning, bile and dyspepsia fought heroically for 
my soul J and yet the little animal is easy enough 
to prepare, being nothing grander than a Welsh 
rarebit, with a poached egg atop. But the little 
tins (silver, like the forks and spoons, until the 
greed and forgetfulness of mankind necessitated 
the substitution of electro- plate) which the Hebes 



i86 CAKES AND ALE 

at the " Old Cheshire Cheese " fill with fragments 
of the hostelry's godfather — subsequently to be 
stewed in good old ale — are less harmful to the 
interior of the human diaphragm, 

A favourite Albion supper -dish during the 
summer months was 

LamVs Head and Mince. 

I have preserved the recipe, a gift from one 
of the waiters — but whether Ponsford, Taylor, 
or "Shakespeare" (so-called because he bore not 
the faintest resemblance to the immortal bard) I 
forget — and here it is : 

The head should be scalded, scraped, and well 
washed. Don't have it singed, in the Scottish 
fashion, as lamb's wool is not nice to eat. Then 
put it, with the liver (the sweetbread was chopped up 
with the brain, I fancy), into a stewpan, with a 
Spanish onion stuck with cloves, a bunch of parsley, 
a little thyme, a carrot, a turnip, a bay leaf, some 
crushed peppercorns, a table-spoonful of salt, and 
half a gallon of cold water. Let it boil up, skim, 
and then simmer for an hour. Divide the head, 
take out the tongue and brain, and dry the rest of 
the head in a cloth. Mince the liver and tongue, 
season with salt and pepper, and simmer in the 
original gravy (thickened) for half-an-hour. Brush 
the two head-halves with yolk of egg, grate bread 
crumbs over, and bake in oven. The brain and 
sweetbread to be chopped and made into cakes, fried, 
and then placed in the dish around the head-halves. 

Ah me ! The old tavern, after falling into 
bad ways, entertaining " extra - ladies " and 
ruined gamesters, has been closed for years. 



SUPPER 187 

The ground floor was a potato warehouse the 
last time I passed the place. And it should be 
mentioned that the actors, journaHsts, etc., who, 
in the 'seventies, possessed smaller means, or more 
modest ambitions, were in the habit of supping 
— on supping days — at a cheaper haunt in the 
Strand, off (alleged) roast goose. But, according 
to one Joseph Eldred, a comedian of some note 
and shirt-cuff, the meat which was apportioned 
to us here was, in reality, always bullock's heart, 
sliced, and with a liberal allowance of sage and 
onions. " It's the seasoning as does it," observed 
Mr. Samuel Weller. 

Then there was another Bohemian house of 
call, and supper place, in those nights — the 
" Occidental," once known as the " Coal Hole," 
where, around a large, beautifully polished ma- 
hogany table, many of the wits of the town — 
" Harry " Leigh and " Tom " Purnell were two 
of the inveterates — sat, and devoured Welsh 
rarebits, and other things. The house, too, 
could accommodate not a few lodgers ; and one 
of its great charms was that nobody cared a 
button what time you retired to your couch, or 
what time you ordered breakfast. In these 
matters, the Occidental resembled the "Lim- 
mer's" of the "Billy Duff" era, and the 
" Lane's " of my own dear subaltern days. 

Parlour Cookery. 

It was after the last-named days that, whilst 
on tour with various dramatic combinations — 
more from necessity than art, as far as I was 
concerned — that the first principles of parlour 



1 88 CAKES AND ALE 

cookery became impregnated in mine under- 
standing. We were not all "stars," although 
we did our best. Salaries were (according to 
the advertisements) "low but sure"; and (ac- 
cording to experiences) by no means as sure as 
death, or taxes. The "spectre" did not invari- 
ably assume his " martial stalk," of a Saturday ; 
and cheap provincial lodgings do not hold out 
any extra inducement in the way of cookery. 
So, whilst we endured the efforts of the good 
landlady at the early dinner, some of us deter- 
mined to dish up our own suppers. For the true 
artist never really feels (or never used to feel, at 
all events) like "picking a bit" until merely 
commercial folks have gone to bed. 

Many a time and oft, with the aid of a cigar 
box (empty, of course), a couple of books, and 
an arrangement of plates, have I prepared a 
savoury supper of mushrooms, toasted cheese, 
or a kebob of larks, or other small fowl, in front 
of the fire. More than once have I received 
notice to quit the next morning for grilling 
kidneys on the perforated portion of a handsome 
and costly steel fire-shovel. And by the time I had 
become sufficiently advanced in culinary science 
to stew tripe and onions, in an enamel-lined 
saucepan, the property of the " responsible gent," 
we began to give ourselves airs. Landladies* 
ideas on the subject of supper for " theatricals," 
it may be mentioned, seldom soared above yeast 
dumplings. And few of us liked the name, 
even, of yeast dumplings. 

But perhaps the champion effort of all was 
when I was sojourning in the good city of 



SUPPER 189 

Carlisle — known to its inhabitants by the pet 
name of " Cannie Carle." A good lady was, for 
her sins, providing us with board and lodging, in 
return for (promised) cash. My then companion 
was a merry youth who afterwards achieved fame 
by writing the very funniest and one of the most 
successful of three-act farces that was ever placed 
upon the stage. Now there is not much the 
matter with a good joint of ribs of beef, roasted to 
a turn. But when that beef is placed on the table 
hot for the Sunday dinner, and cold at every 
succeeding meal until finished up, one's appetite 
for the flesh of the ox begins to slacken. So we 
determined on the Wednesday night to " strike " 
for a tripe supper. 

" Indeed," protested the good landlady, " ye'U 
get nae tripe in this hoose, cannie men. Hae ye 
no' got guid beef, the noo ? " 

Late that night we had grilled bones for 
supper ; not the ordinary 

Grilled Bones 

which you get in an eating house, but a vastly 
superior article. We, or rather my messmate, cut 
a rib from oflF the aforementioned beef, scored the 
flesh across, and placed the bone in the centre of a 
beautifully clear fire which had been specially 
prepared. It was placed there by means of the 
tongs — a weapon of inestimable value in Parlour 
Cookery — and withdrawn by the same medium. 
Some of the black wanted scraping off the surface 
of the meat, but the grill was a perfect dream. 
The GuBBiNS Sauce, already mentioned in this 
volume, had not at that time been invented ; but 



I90 CAKES AND ALE 

as I was never without a bottle of Tapp Sauce — 
invaluable for Parlour Cookery ; you can get it at 
Stembridge's — we had plenty of relish. Then 
we severed another rib from the carcase, and 
served it in the same manner. For it was winter 
time and we had wearied of frigid ox. 

Next morning the landlady's face was a study. I 
rather think that after some conversation, we propi- 
tiated her with an order for two for the dress circle ; 
but it is certain that we had tripe that evening. 

An ideal supper in miladi's boudoir is associated, 
in the writer's mind, with rose-coloured draperies, 
dainty china, a cosy fire, a hberal display of 
lingerie^ a strong perfume of heHotrope and orris 
root — and miladi herself. When next she invites 
her friends, she will kindly order the following 
repast to be spread : — 

Clear soup, in cups. 

Fillets of soles Parisienne, 

Chaudfroid of Quails. 

Barded sweetbreads. 

Perigord pat6. 

By way of contrast, let me quote a typical 
supper-dish which the " poor player " used to 
order, when he could afford it. 

Kidney Dumpling, 

Cut a large Spanish onion in half. Take out the 
heart, and substitute a sheep's kidney, cut into four. 
Season with salt and pepper, join the two halves, 
and enclose in a paste. Bake on a buttered tin, in 
a moderate oven, for about an hour. 

N.B. — Be sure the cook bakes this dumpling, as it 
is not nice boiled. 



SUPPER 191 

An artistic friend who at one time of his life 
resided near the great horse- training centre of 
Middleham, in Yorkshire, gave a steak supper at 
the principal inn, to some of the stable attendants. 
The fare was highly approved of. 

" Best Scotch beef I ever put tooth into ! " 
observed the " head lad " at old Tom Lawson's 
stables. 

" Ah ! " returned the host, who was a bit of 
a wag, " your beef was cut from a colt of Lord 
Glasgow's that was thought highly of at one time; 
and he was shot the day before yesterday." 

And it was so. For Lord Glasgow never sold 
nor gave away a horse, but had all his " failures " 
shot. 

And then a great cry went up for brown 
brandy. 



CHAPTER XVll 



'"''CAMPING OUT 

" Thou didst eat strange flesh. 
Which some did die to look on." 

The ups and downs of life — Stirring adventures — Marching on to 
glory — Shooting in the tropics — Pepper-pot — With the 
Rajah Sahib — Goat-sacrifices at breakfast time — Simla to 
Cashmere — Manners and customs of Thibet — Burmah — No 
place to get fat in — Insects — Voracity of the natives — 
Snakes — Sport in the Jungle — Loaded for snipe, sure to meet

1'he intelligent reader may have gathered from 
some of the foregoing pages that the experiences 
of the writer have been of a variegated nature. 
As an habitual follower of the Turf once 
observed : 

" When we're rich we rides in chaises, 
And when we're broke we walks like ** 



Never mind what. It was an evil man who said 
it, but he was a philosopher. Dinner in the 
gilded saloon one day, on the next no dinner at 
all, and the key of the street. Such is life ! 

Those experiences do not embrace a mortal 



"CAMPING OUT" 193 

combat with a " grizzly " in the Rockies, nor a 
tramp through a miasma-laden forest in Darkest 
Africa, with nothing better to eat than poisonous 
fung'i^ assorted grasses, red ants, and dwarfs ; nor 
yet a bull fight. But they include roughing it 
in the bush, on underdone bread and scorched 
kangaroo, a tramp from Benares to the frontier 
of British India, another tramp or two some way 
beyond that frontier, a dreadful journey across 
the eternal snows of the Himalayas, a day's shoot- 
ing in the Khyber Pass, a railway accident in 
Middlesex, a mad elephant (he had killed seven 
men, one of them blind) hunt at Thayet Myoo, 
in British Burmah, a fine snake anecdote or two, 
a night at Cambridge with an escaped lunatic, a 
tiger story (of course), and a capture for debt by 
an officer of the Sheriff of Pegu, with no other 
clothing on his body than a short jacket of gaily 
coloured silk, and a loin cloth. My Hfe's history 
is never likely to be written — chiefly through 
sheer laziness on my own part, and the absence 
of the gambling instinct on that of the average 
publisher — but like the brown gentleman who 
smothered his wife, I have "seen things." 

In this chapter no allusion will be made to 
" up river " delights, the only idea of " camping 
out " which is properly understood by the 
majority of " up to date " young men and maidens ; 
for this theme has been already treated, most 
comically and delightfully, by Mr. Jerome, in the 
funniest book I ever read. My own camping 
experiences have been for the most part in foreign 
lands, though I have seen the sun rise, whilst 
reclining beneath the Royal trees in St. James's 



194 CAKES AND ALE 

Park ; and as this book is supposed to deal with 
gastronomy, rather than adventure, a brief sketch 
of camp life must suffice. 

On the march ! What a time those who 
"served the Widdy'* — by which disrespectful 
term, our revered Sovereign was not known in 
those days — used to have before the continent of 
India had been intersected by the railroad ! The 
absence of one's proper quantum of rest, the forced 
marches over kutcha (imperfectly made) bye- 
roads, the sudden changes of temperature, raids 
of the native thief, the troubles with " bobbery " 
camels, the still more exasperating behaviour of 
the bail-wallahs (bullock -drivers), the awful 
responsibiHties of the officer- on -baggage -guard, 
on active duty, often in the saddle for fifteen 
hours at a stretch, the absolutely necessary cattle- 
raids, by the roadside — all these things are well 
known to those who have undergone them, but 
are far too long "another story" to be related 
here. As for the food partaken of during a 
march with the regiment, the bill-of-fare differed 
but little from that of the cantonments ; but the 
officer who spent a brief holiday in a shooting 
expedition had to " rough it " in more ways than 
one. 

There was plenty of game all over the con- 
tinent in my youthful days, and the average shot 
need not have lacked a dinner, even if he had not 
brought with him a consignment of " Europe " 
provisions. English bread was lacking, certainly, 
and biscuits, native or otherwise — "otherwise" 
for choice, as the bazaar article tasted principally 
of pin-cushions and the smoke of dried and Hghted 



"CAMPING OUT" 195 

cow -dung — or the ordinary chupattt^ the flat, 
unleavened cake, which the poor Indian manu- 
factures for his own consumption. Cold tea is 
by far the best liquid to carry — or rather to have 
carried for you — whilst actually shooting; but 
the weary sportsman will require something 
more exciting, and more poetical, on his return 
to camp. As for solid fare it was usually 

Pepper-pot 

for dinner, day by day. We called it Pepper- 
pot — that is to say, although it differed somewhat 
from the West Indian concoction of that name, 
for which the following is the recipe : — 

Put the remains of any cold flesh or fowl into a 
saucepan, and cover with casaripe — which has been 
already described in the Curry chapter as extract of 
Manioc root. Heat up the stew and serve. 

Our pepper-pot was usually made in a gipsy- 
kettle, suspended from a tripod. The foundation 
of the stew was always a tin of some kind of 
soup. Then a few goat chops — mutton is bad 
to buy out in the jungle — and then any bird or 
beast that may have been shot, divided into 
fragments. I have frequently made a stew of 
this sort, with so many ingredients in it that the 
flavour when served out at table — or on the 
bullock-trunk which often did duty for a table — 
would have beaten the wit of man to describe. 
There was hare soup "intil't" (as the Scotsman 
said to the late Prince Consort), and a collop or 
two of buffalo -beef, with snipe, quails, and 
junffle-fowl. There were half the neck of an 



196 CAKES AND ALE 

antelope and a few sliced onions lurking within 
the bow!. And there were potatoes "intil't," 
and plenty cf pepper and salt. And for lack of 
casarine /^e flavoured the savoury mess with 
mango chutnee and Tapp sauce. And if any 
cook, English or foreign, can concoct a more 
worthy dish than this, or more grateful to the 
palate, said cook can come my way. 

The old dak gharry method of travelling in 
India may well come under the head of Camping 
Out. In the hot weather we usually progressed 
— or got emptied into a ditch — or collided with 
something else, during the comparative " coolth " 
of the night ; resting (which in Hindustan 
usually means perspiring and calling the country 
names) all day at one or other of the dak bunga- 
lows provided by a benevolent Government for 
the use of the wandering sahih. The larder at 
one of those rest-houses was seldom well filled. 
Although the khansamah who prostrated himself 
in the sand at your approach would delare that 
he was prepared to supply everything which the 
protector -of- the- poor might deign to order, it 
would be found on further inquiry that the 
khansamah had, like the Player Oueen in Hamlet, 
protested too much — that he was a natural 
romancer. And his "everything" usually re- 
solved itself into a " spatch-cock," manufactured 
from the spectral rooster, who had heralded the 
approach of the sahibs caravan. 

A Rajah's 

ideas of hospitality are massive. Labouring under 
the belief that the white sahib when not eating 



«CAMPlNO OUT*' 197 

must necessarily be drinking, the commissariat 
arrangements of Rajah dom are on a colossal scale 
— for the chief benefit of his major domo. I 
might have bathed in dry champagne, had the 
idea been pleasing, whilst staying with a certain 
genial prince, known to irreverent British sub- 
alterns as " Old Coppertail " ; whilst the bedroom 
furniture was on the same liberal scale. True, 
I lay on an ordinary native charpoy^ which might 
have been bought in the bazaar for a few annas, 
but there was a grand piano in one corner of the 
apartment, and a buhl cabinet containing rare 
china in another. There was a coloured print 
of the Governor- General over the doorway, and 
an oil painting of the Judgment of Solomon over 
the mantelshelf. And on a table within easy 
reach of the bed was a silver-plated dinner 
service, decked with fruits and sweetmeats, and 
tins of salmon, and pots of Guava jelly and mixed 
pickles, and two tumblers, each of which would 
have easily held a week -old baby. And there 
was a case of champagne beneath that table, with 
every appliance for cutting wires and extracting 
the corks. 

Another time the writer formed one of a small 
party invited to share the hospitality of a potentate, 
whose estate lay on the snowy side of Simla. The 
fleecy element, however, was not in evidence in 
June, the month of our visit, although towards 
December Simla herself is usually wrapt in the 
white mantle, and garrisoned by monkeys, who 
have fled from the land of ice. Tents had been 
erected for us in a barren -looking valley, some- 
what famous, however, for the cultivation of 



198 CAKES AND ALE 

potatoes. There was an annual celebration of 
some sort, the day after our arrival, and for break- 
fast that morning an al fresco meal had been 
prepared for us, almost within whispering distance 
of an heathen temple. And it was a breakfast ! 
There was a turkey stuffed with a fowl, to make 
the breast larger, and there was a "Europe" 
ham. A tin of lobster, a bottle of pickled 
walnuts, a dreadful concoction, alleged to be an 
omelette, but looking more like the sole of a 
tennis shoe, potatoes, boiled eggs, a dish of Irish 
stew, a fry of small fish, a weird-looking curry, 
a young goat roasted whole, and a plum pudding ! 
The tea had hardly been poured out — Kus- 
sowlee beer, Epps's cocoa, and (of course) 
champagne, and John Exshaw's brandy were also 
on tap — when a gentleman with very little on 
proceeded to decapitate a goat at the foot of the 
temple steps. This was somewhat startling, 
but when the (presumed) high-priest chopped 
off the head of another bleating victim, our meal 
was interrupted. The executions had been 
carried out in very simple fashion. First, the 
priest sprinkled a little water on the neck of the 
victim (who was held in position by an assistant), 
and then retired up the steps. Then, brandish- 
ing a small sickle, he rushed back, and in an 
instant off went the head, which was promptly 
carried, reeking with gore, within the temple. 
But if, as happened more than once, the head 
was not sliced off at the initial attempt, it was 
left on the ground when decapitation had been 
at length effected. The deity inside was evi- 
dently a bit particular I 



"CAMPING OUT" 199 

Nine goats had been sacrificed, ere our 
remonstrances were attended to ; and we were 
allowed to pursue our meal in peace. But I 
don't think anybody had goat for breakfast that 
morning. 

Later on, the fun of the fair commenced, and 
the paharis^ or hill men, trooped in from miles 
round, with their sisters, cousins, and aunts. 
Their wives, we imagined, were too busily 
occupied in carrying their accustomed loads of 
timber to and fro. Your Himalayan delights in 
a fair, and the numerous swings and roundabouts 
were all well patronised ; whilst the jugglers, and 
the snake charmers — in many instances it was 
difficult to tell at a glance which was charmer 
and which snake — were all well patronised. 
Later on, when the lamps had been lit, a hurra 
natch was started, and the BengaH Baboos who 
had come all the way from Simla in dhoolies to 
be present at this, applauded vigorously. And 
our host being in constant dread lest we should 
starve to death or expire of thirst, never tired of 
bidding us to a succession of banquets at which 
we simply went through the forms of eating, to 
please him. And just when we began to get 
sleepy these simple hill folks commenced to dance 
amongst themselves. They were just a little 
monotonous, their choregraphic efforts. Parties 
of men linked arms and sidled around fires of 
logs, singing songs of their mountain homes the 
while. And as they were evidently determined 
to make a night of it, sleep for those who under- 
stood not the game, with their tents close handy, 
was out of the question. And when, as soon as we 



200 CAKES AND ALE 

could take our departure decently and decorously, 
we started up the hill again, those doleful 
monotonous dances were still in progress, al- 
though the fires were out, and the voices de- 
cidedly husky. A native of the Himalayas is 
nothing if not energetic — in his own interests be 
it understood. 

A few months later I formed one of a small 
party who embarked on a more important 
expedition than the last named, although we 
traversed the same road. It is a journey which 
has frequently been made since, from Simla to 
Cashmere, going as far into the land of the 
Great Llama as the inhabitants will allow the 
stranger to do — which is not very far j but, in 
the early sixties there were but few white men who 
had even skirted Thibet. In the afternoon of 
life, when stirring the fire has become prefer- 
able to stirring adventure, it seems (to the 
writer at all events) very like an attempt at 
self-slaughter to have travelled so many hundreds 
of miles along narrow goatpaths, with a khud 
(precipice) of thousands of feet on one side or 
the other ; picking one's way, if on foot, over 
the frequent avalanche (or "land slip," as we 
called it in those days) of shale or granite; or 
if carried in a dhoolie — which is simply a ham- 
mock attached by straps to a bamboo pole — 
running the risk of being propelled over a 
precipice by your heathen carriers. It is not the 
pleasantest of sensations to cross a mountain 
torrent by means of a frail bridge (called a.jhuia) 
of ropes made from twigs, and stretched many 
feet above the torrent itself, nor to " weather " 



"CAMPING OUT" 201 

a corner, whilst clinging tooth and nail to the 
face of a clifF. And when there is any riding to 
be done, most people would prefer a hill pony to 
a yak^ the native ox of Thibet. By far the best 
part of a yak is his beautiful silky, fleecy tail, 
which is largely used in Hindustan, by de- 
pendants of governors - general, commanders-in- 
chief, and other mighty ones, for the discomfiture 
of the frequent fly. A very little equestrian 
exercise on the back of a yak goes a long way ; 
and if given my choice, I would sooner ride a 
stumbling cab-horse in a saddle with spikes in 
it. 

But those days were our salad ones ; we were 
not only "green of judgment," but admirers of 
the beautiful, and reckless of danger. But it 
was decidedly "roughing it." As it is advisable 
to traverse that track as lightly laden as possible, 
we took but few " Europe " provisions with us, 
depending upon the villages, for the most part, 
for our supplies. We usually managed to buy 
a little flour, wherewith to make the inevit- 
able chupati^ and at some of the co-operative 
stores en route^ we obtained mutton of fair 
flavour. We did not know in those days that 
flesh exposed to the air, in the higher ranges of 
the Himalayas, will not putrefy, else we should 
nave doubtless made a species of biltong of the 
surplus meat, to carry with us in case of any 
famine about. So " short commons " frequently 
formed the bill of fare. Our little stock of 
brandy was carefully husbanded, against illness ; 
and, judging from the subsequent histories of two 
of the party, this was the most miraculous 



202 CAKES AND ALE 

feature of the expedition. For liquid refresh- 
ment we had neat water, and the a la mode cle 
Thibet. Doctor Nan sen, in his book on the 
crossing of Greenland, inveighs strongly against 
the use of alcohol in an Arctic expedition ; but 
I confess that the first time I tasted Thibet tea 
I would have given both my ears for a soda and 
brandy. I'he raw tea was compressed into the 
shape of a brick, with the aid of — we did not 
inquire what ; its infusion was drunk, either 
cold or lukewarm, flavoured with salt, and a 
small lump of butter which in any civilised 
police court would have gained the vendor a 
month's imprisonment without the option of a 
fine. 

The people of the district were in the habit 
of gorging themselves with flesh when they 
could get it ; and polyandry was another of their 
pleasant customs. We saw one lady who was 
married to three brothers, but di-d not boast of 
it. Thibet is probably the most priest-ridden 
country in the world, and ought to be the most 
religious; for the natives can grind out their 
prayers, on wheels, at short intervals, in pretty 
much the same way as we grind our coffee in 
dear old England. 

But we reached the promised land at last ; 
and here at least there was no lack of food and 
drink. Meat was cheap in those days ; and one 
of the party, without any bargaining whatever, 
purchased a sheep for eight annas, or one shilling 
sterling. Mutton is not quite as cheap at the 
time of writing this book (1897), ^ beheve ; but 
in the long ago there were but few English 



"CAMPING OUT" ±03 

visitors to the land of Lalla Rookh, and those 
who did go had to obtain permission of the 
Rajah, through the British Resident. 

With improved transit, and a railroad from 
Rangoon to Mandalay, matters gastronomic 
may be better in British Burmah nowadays j but 
in the course of an almost world-wide experience 
I have never enjoyed food less than in Pagoda- 
land during the sixties. And as a Burmese built 
house was not a whit more comfortable than a 
tent, and far less waterproof, this subject may 
well be included in the chapter headed " Camp- 
ing Out." Fruits there were, varied and plenti- 
ful ; and if you only planted the crown of a pine- 
apple in your compound one evening you would 
probably find a decent-sized pine-apple above 
ground next — well, next week. At least so 
they told me when I arrived in the country. 
This fruit, in fact, was so plentiful that we used 
to peel the pines, and gnaw them, just like a school- 
boy would gnaw the ordinary variety of apple. 
But we had no mutton — not up the country, 
that is to say ; and we were entirely dependent 
upon Madras for potatoes. Therefore, as there 
was only a steamer once a month from Madras 
to Rangoon, which invariably missed the 
Irrawaddy monthly mail-boat, we " exiles " had 
to content ourselves with yams, or the abomin- 
able " preserved " earth-apple. The insects of 
the air wrestled with us at the mess-table, for 
food ; and the man who d,id not swallow an 
evil -tasting fly of some sort in his soup was 
lucky.' As for the food of the Burman himself, 

^ Our then commanding officer was noted for his powers of

"absolutely beastly" was no name for it. 
Strips of cat-fish the colour of beef were served 
at his marriage feasts ; and he was especially 
fond of a condiment the name of which was 
pronounced nuppee — although that is probably 
not the correct spelling, and I never studied 
the language of that country — which was con- 
cocted from a smaller description of fish, buried 
in the earth until decomposition had triumphed, 
and then mashed up with ghee (clarified — and 
"postponed" — butter). There was, certainly, 
plenty of shooting to be obtained in the district j 
but, as it rained in torrents for nine months in 
every year, the shooter required a considerable 
amount of nerve, and, in addition to a Boyton 
suit, case-hardened lungs and throat. And, 
singularly enough, it was an established fact that 
if loaded for snipe you invariably met a tiger, or 
something else with sharp teeth, and vice versa. 
Also, you were exceptionally fortunate if you 
did not step upon one of the venomous snakes of 
the country, of whom the hamadryad's bite was 
said to be fatal within five minutes. I had 
omitted to mention that snake is also a favourite 
food of the Burman j and as I seldom went home 
of an evening without finding a rat-snake or two 
in the verandah, or the arm-chair, the natives had 
snake for breakfast, most days. The rat-snake 
is, however, quite harmless to life. 

I have "camped out" in England once or 

self-control. I once noticed him leave the table hurriedly, and 
retire to the verandah. After an interval he returned, and 
apologised to the President. Our revered chief had only swal- 
lowed a flying bug. And he never even used a big D.

twice ; once with a select circle of gipsies, the 
night before the Derby. I wished merely to 
study character ; and, after giving them a few 
words of the Romany dialect, and a good deal of 
tobacco, I was admitted into their confidences. 
But the experience gained was not altogether 
pleasing, nor yet edifying ; nor did we have 
baked hedgehog for supper. In fact I have 
never yet met the "gippo" (most of them keep 
fowls) who will own to having tasted this bonne 
houche of the descriptive writer. Possibly this 
is on account of the scarcity of the hedgehog. 
"Tea-kettle broth" — bread sopped in water, 
with a little salt and dripping to flavour the soup 
— on the other hand, figures on most of the 
gipsy menus. And upon one occasion, very 
early in the morning, another wanderer and the 
writer obtained much-needed liquid refreshment 
by milking the yield of a Jersey cow into each 
other's mouths, alternately. But this was a long 
time ago, and in the neighbourhood of Bagshot 
Heath, and it was somebody else's cow ; so let 
no more be said about it. 

I fear this chapter is not calculated to make 
many mouths water. In fact what in the world 
has brought it into the midst of a work on gas- 
tronomy I am at a loss to make out. However 
here it is. 



CHAPTER XVIII

" Flow wine ! Smile woman ! 
And the universe is consoled." 

Derivation of punch— " Five "—The "milk" brand— The best 
materials — Various other punches — Bischoff or Bishop — 
" Halo " punch— Toddy— The toddy tree of India— Flip— 
A " peg " — John Collins — Out of the guard-room. 

The subject of Punch is such an important 
one that it may be placed first on the list of 
dainty beverages which can be made by the art 
or application of man or woman. 

First, let us take the origin of the word. 
Doctor Kitchener, an acknowledged authority, 
during his lifetime, on all matters connected 'with 
eating and drinking, has laid it down that punch 
is of West Indian origin, and that the word when 
translated, means "five"j because there be five 
ingredients necessary in the concoction of the 
beverage. But Doctor Kitchener and his dis- 
ciples (of whom there be many) may go to the 
bottom of the cookery class ; for although from 
the large connection which rum and limes have 



COMPOUND DRINKS 207 

with the mixture, there would seem to be a West 
Indian flavour about it ; the word "five," when 
translated into West Indianese, is nothing like 
"punch." Having satisfied themselves that this is a 
fact, modern authorities have tried the East Indies 
for the source of the name, and have discovered 
that panch in Hindustani really does mean "five." 
" Therefore," says one modern authority, " it is 
named punch from the five ingredients which 
compose it — (i) spirit, (2) acid, (3) spice, (4) 
sugar, (5) water." Another modern authority 
calls punch " a beverage introduced into England 
from India, and so called from being usually 
made of five (Hindi, panch) ingredients — arrack, 
tea, sugar, water, and lemon juice." This sounds 
far more like an East Indian concoction than the 
other ; but at the same time punch — during the 
latter half of the nineteenth century at all events 
— was as rare a drink in Hindustan as bhang in 
Great Britain. The panch theory is an ingeni- 
ous one, but there are plenty of other combina- 
tions (both liquid and solid) of five to which the 
word punch is never applied ; and about the last 
beverage recommended by the faculty for the 
consumption of the sojourner in the land of the 
Great Mogul, would, I should think, be the en- 
trancing, seductive one which we Britons know 
under the name of punch. Moreover it is not 
every punch-concoctor who uses five ingredients. 
In the minds of some — youthful members of the 
Stock Exchange, for the most part — water is an 
altogether unnecessary addition to the alcoholic 
mixture which is known by the above name. 
And what manner of man would add spice to 



20? CAKES AND ALE 

that delight of old Ireland, "a jug o' punch ?" 
On the other hand, in many recipes, there are 
more than five ingredients used. 

But after all, the origin of the name is of but 
secondary importance, as long as you can make 
punch. Therefore, we will commence with a 
few recipes for 

Milk Punch. 

I. Three bottles of rum. 

The most delicately-flavoured rum is the "Liquid 
Sunshine '* brand. 

One bottle of sherry. 

1 3 lbs of loaf-sugar. 

The rind of six lemons, and the juice of twelve. 

One quart of boiling skimmed milk. 

Mix together, let the mixture stand eight days, 
stirring it each day. Strain and bottle, and let it 
stand three months. Then re-bottle, and let the 
bottles lie on their sides in the cellar for two years, 
to mature. The flavour will be much better than 
if drunk after the first period of three months. 

It is not everybody, however, who would care 
to wait two years, three months, and eight days 
for the result of his efforts in punch-making. 
Therefore another recipe may be appended ; and 
in this one no '• close time " is laid down for the 
consumption of the mixture. 

z. Put into a bottle of rum or brandy the thinly- 
pared rinds of three Seville oranges, and three lemons. 
Cork tightly for two days. Rub off on 2 lbs of lump 
sugar the rinds of six lemons, squeeze the juice from 
the whole of the fruit over the 2 lbs of sugar, add 
three quarts of boiling water, one of boiling milk, 
half a teaspoonful of nutmeg, and mix all thoroughly 



COMPOUND DRINKS 209 

well together until the sugar is dissolved. Pour in 
the rum or brandy, stir, and strain till clear ; bottle 
closely. 

There is more than one objection to this 
recipe, (i) Rum, and not brandy (by itself), 
should be used for milk punch. (2) There is an 
" intolerable amount " of water ; and (3) the nut- 
meg had better remain in the spice-box. 

3. Cut off the thin yellow rind of four lemons 
and a Seville orange, taking care not to include even 
a fragment of the white rind, and place in a basin. 
Pour in one pint of Jamaica rum, and let it stand, 
covered over, twelve hours. Then strain, and mix 
with it one pint of lemon juice, and two pints of 
cold water, in which one pound of sugar-candy has 
been dissolved ; add the whites of two eggs, beaten 
to a froth, three pints more of rum, one pint of 
madeira, one pint of strong green tea, and a large 
wine-glassful of maraschino. Mix thoroughly, and 
pour over all one pint of boiling milk. Let the 
punch stand a little while, then strain through a 
jelly-bag, and either use at once, or bottle off. 

Here let it be added, lest the precept be for- 
gotten, that the 

Very best Materials 

are absolutely necessary for the manufacture of 
punch, as of other compound drinks. In the 
above recipe for instance by " madeira," is meant 
"Rare Old East Indian," and not marsala, 
which wine, in French kitchens, is invariably 
used as the equivalent of madeira. There must 
be no inferior sherry, Gladstone claret, cheap 
champagne, nor potato-brandy, used for any of 



210 CAKES AND ALE 

my recipes, or I will not be responsible for the 
flavour of the beverage. The following is the 
best idea of a milk punch known to the writer : — 

4. Over the yellow rind of four lemons and one 
Seville orange, pour one pint of rum. Let it stand, 
covered over, for twelve hours. Strain and mix in 
two pints more of rum, one pint of brandy, 
one pint of sherry, half-a-pint of lemon juice, 
the expressed juice of a peeled pine-apple, one 
pint of green tea, one pound of sugar dissolved in 
one quart of boiling water, the whites of two eggs 
beaten up, one quart of boiling milk. Mix well, let 
it cool, and then strain through a jelly- bag, and 
bottle off. 

This punch is calculated to make the epicure 
forget that he has just been partaking of conger- 
eel broth instead of clear turtle. 

Cambridge Milk Punch, 

This a fairly good boys' beverage, there being 
absolutely " no offence in't." Put the rind of half 
a lemon (small) into one pint of new milk, with 
twelve lumps of sugar. Boil very slowly for fifteen 
minutes, then remove from the fire, take out the 
iemon rind, and mix in the yolk of one egg, which 
has been previously blended with one table-spoonful 
of cold milk, two table-spoonfuls of brandy, and four 
of rum. Whisk all together, and when the mixture 
is frothed, it is ready to serve. 

Oxford Punch, 

There is no milk in this mixture, which 
sounds like " for'ard on ! " for the undergraduate 
who for the first time samples it. 



COMPOUND DRINKS 211 

Rub off the yellow rind of three lemons with 
half-a-pound of loaf sugar. Put the result into a 
large jug, with the yellow rind of one Seville orange, 
the juice of three Seville oranges and eight lemons, 
and one pint of liquefied calf's-foot jelly. ' Mix 
thoroughly, then pour over two quarts of boiling 
water, and set the jug on the hob for thirty minutes. 
Strain the mixtttre into a punch-bowl, and when 
cool acki one small bottle of capillaire (an infusion 
of maiclenha-** ^'rn, flavoured with sugar and orange- 
flower water) ; one pint of brandy, one pint of rum, 
half-a-pint of dry sherry, and one quart of orange 
shrub — a mixture of orange-peel, juice, sugar, and 
rum. 

After drinking this, the young student will 
be in a fit state to sally forth, with his fellows, 
and " draw " a Dean, or drown an amateur 
journalist. 

I have a very old recipe, in MS., for 
" BischofF," which I take to be the original 
of the better known beverage called " Bishop," for 
the manufacture of which I have also directions. 
For the sake of comparison I give the two. 

Bischoff. 

Cut into four parts each, three Seville oranges, 
and slightly score the rinds across with a sharp 
knife. Roast the quarters lightly before a slow fire, 
and put them into a bowl with two bottles of claret, 
with a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Infuse this 
mixture over a slow heat for five or six hours, then 
pass it through a jelly-bag, and sweeten. It may be 
drunk hot or cold, but in any case must never be 
allowed to boil. 



2IZ CAKES AND ALE 

Bishop, 

Two drachmas each of cloves, mace, ginger, 
cinnamon, and allspice, boiled in half-a-pint of 
water for thirty minutes. Strain. Put a bottle of 
port in a saucepan over the fire, add the spiced 
infusion, and a lemon stuck with six cloves. Whilst 
this is heating gradually — it must not boil — take 
four ounces of loaf sugar, and with the lumps grate 
off the outer rind of a lemon into a punch-bowl. 
Add the sugar, and juice, and the hot wine, etc. Add 
another bottle of port, and serve either hot or cold. 

I am prepared to lay a shade of odds on the 
"op" against the "off." 

Another old recipe has been quoted in some 
of my earlier public efforts, under different names. 
I have improved considerably upon the propor- 
tion of the ingredients, and now hand the 
whole back, under the name of 

Halo Punch. 
With a quarter pound of loaf sugar rub off the 
outer rind of one lemon and two Seville oranges. Put 
rind and sugar into a large punch-bowl with the 
juice and pulp, mix the sugar well with the juice 
and one teacupful of boiling water, and stir till cold. 
Add half-a-pint of pine-apple syrup, one pint of 
strong green tea, a claret-glassful of maraschino, a 
smaller glassful of noyeau, half-a-pint of white rum, 
one pint of brandy, and one bottle of champagne. 
Strain and serve, having, if necessary, added more 
sugar. 

Note well the proportions. This is the same 
beverage which some Cleveland friends of mine, 
having read the recipe, thought boiling would 



COMPOUND DRINKS 213 

improve. The result was — well, a consider- 
able amount of chaos. 

Glasgow Punch. 

The following is from Peter's Letters to his 
Kinsfolk^ and is from the pen of John Gibson 
Lockhart : — 

The sugar being melted with a little cold water, 
the artist squeezed about a dozen lemons through a 
wooden strainer, and then poured in water enough 
almost to fill the bowl. In this state the liquor goes 
by the name of sherbet, and a few of the connoisseurs 
in his immediate neighbourhood were requested to 
give their opinion of it — for in the mixing of the 
sherbet lies, according to the Glasgow creed, at least 
one-half of the whole battle. This being approved 
of by an audible smack from the lips of the umpires, 
the rum was added to the beverage, I suppose, in 
something about the proportion from one to seven. 

Does this mean one of sherbet and seven of 
rum, or the converse ? 

Last of all, the maker cut a few limes, and run- 
ning each section rapidly round the rim of his bowl, 
squeezed in enough of this more delicate acid to 
flavour the whole composition. In this consists the 
true tour-de-maitre of the punch-maker. 

Well, possibly \ but it seems a plainish sort of 
punch ; and unless the rum be allowed to pre- 
ponderate, most of us would be inclined to call 
the mixture lemonade. And I do not believe 
that since Glasgow has been a city its citizens 
ever drank much of that. 

A few more punches, and then an anecdote. 



tH CAKES AND ALE 

Ale Punch. 

One quart of mild ale in a bowl, add one wine- 
glassful of brown sherry, the same quantity of old 
brandy, a table-spoonful of sifted sugar, the peel and 
juice of one lemon, a grate of nutmeg, and an ice- 
berg. 

N.B. — Do not insert old ale, by mistake. And 
for my own part, I think it a mistake to mix John 
Barleycorn with wine (except champagne) and spirits. 

Barhadoes Punch* 

A table-spoonful of raspberry syrup, a ditto of sifted 
sugar, a wine-glassful of water, double that quantity 
of brandy, half a wine-glassful of guava jelly, liquid, 
the juice of half a lemon, two slices of orange, one 
slice of pine-apple, in a long tumbler. Ice and shake 
well and drink through straws. 

Curafoa Punch, 

Put into a large tumbler one table-spoonful of 
sifted sugar, one wine-glassful of brandy, the same 
quantity of water, half a wine-glassful of Jamaica 
rum, a wine-glassful of cura9oa, and the juice of half 
a lemon ; fill the tumbler with crushed ice, shake, 
and drink through straws. 

Grassot Punch. 

This has nothing to do with warm asparagus, so 
have no fear. It is simply another big -tumbler 
mixture, of one wine-glassful of brandy, a liqueur- 
glassful of cura9oa, a squeeze of lemon, two tea- 
spoonfuls sugar, one of syrup of strawberries, one 
wine-glassful of water, and the thin rind of a lemon ; 
fill up the tumbler with crushed ice, shake, and put 
slices of ripe apricots atop. Drink how you like. 



COMPOUND DRINKS 21 ^ 

Most of the above are hot-weather beverages, 
and the great beauty of some of them will be 
found in the small quantity of water in the mix- 
ture. Here is a punch which may be drunk in 
any weather, and either hot or cold. 

Regent Punch, 

Pour into a bowl a wine-glassful of champagne, 
the same quantities of hock, cura9oa, rum, and 
madeira. Mix well, and add a pint of boiling tea, 
sweetened. Stir well and serve. 

Apropos of the derivation of "punch," I was 
unaware until quite recently that Messrs. Brad- 
bury's & Agnew's little paper had any connection 
therewith. But I was assured by one who knew 
all about it, that such was the case. 

" What ? " I exclaimed. " How can the 
London Charivari possibly have anything to do 
with this most seductive of beverages ? " 

" My dear fellow," was the reply, " have you 
never heard of Mark Lemon ? " 

I turned to smite him hip and thigh ; but the 
jester had fled. 

And now a word or two as to "Toddy." 
One of the authorities quoted in the punch 
difficulty declares that toddy is also an Indian 
drink. So it is. But that drink no more 
resembles what is known in more civilised lands 
as toddy than I resemble the late king Solomon. 
The palm-sap which the poor Indian distils into 
arrack and occasionally drinks in its natural state 
for breakfast after risking his neck in climbing 
trees to get it, can surely have no connection 
with hot whisky and water ? iYet the authority 



ai6 CAKES AND ALE 

says so ; but he had best be careful ere he pro- 
mulgates his theory in the presence of Scotsmen 
and others who possess special toddy- glasses. 
This is how I make 

IVlnsky Toddy. 

The Irish call this whisky punch. But do not 
let us wrangle over the name. Into an ordinary- 
sized tumbler which has been warmed, put one 
average lump of sugar, a ring of thin lemon peel, and 
a silver tea-spoon. Fill the tumbler one quarter 
full of water as near boiling point as possible. Cover 
over until the sugar be dissolved and peel be infused. 
Then add one wine-glassful — not a small one — of the 
best whisky you can find — the " Pollok " brand, and 
the "R.B." are both excellent. Then drink the 
toddy, or punch ; for should you attempt to add any 
more water you will incur the lifelong contempt of 
every Irishman or Scotsman who may be in the 
same room. If Irish whisky be used, of course you 
will select "John Jameson." 

'Twixt ale-flip and egg-flip there is not much 
more difi^erence than 'twixt tweedledum and tweedle- 
dee. Both are equally "more-ish" on a cold evening ; 
and no Christmas eve is complete without a jug of 
one or the other. 

Ale-flip, 

Pour into a saucepan three pints of mild ale, one 
table-spoonful of sifted sugar, a blade of mace, a clove, 
and a small piece of butter; and bring the liquor to 
a boil. Beat up in a basin the white of one egg and 
the yolks of two, mixed with about a wine-glassful of 
cold ale. Mix all together in the saucepan, then 
pour into a jug, and thence into another jug, from a 
height, for some minutes, to froth the flip thoroughly • 
but do not Jet it get cold. 



COMPOUND DRINKS 117 

Heat one pint of ale, and pour into a jug. Add 
two eggs, beaten with three ounces of sugar, and 
pour the mixture from one jug to the other, as in 
the preceding recipe. Grate a little nutmeg and 
ginger over the flip before serving. 

Were I to ask What is 

J PegP 

I should probably be told that a peg was some- 
thing to hang something or somebody else on, or 
that it was something to be driven through or into 
something else. And the latter would be the more 
correct answer, for at the time of my sojourn in 
the great continent of India, a peg meant a 
large brandy-and-soda. At that time whisky 
was but little known in Punkahland, and was 
only used high up in the Punjaub during the 
"cold weather" — and it is cold occasionally in 
that region, where for some months they are 
enabled to make ice — but that is une autre histoire. 
Rum I once tasted at Simla, and gin will be 
dealt with presently. But since the visit of 
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, a peg has always 
signified a w/^/j-fv-and-soda. And yet we have 
not heard of any particular decrease in the death- 
rate. Despite what those who have only stayed 
a month or two in the country have committed 
to print, alcohol is not more fatal in a tropical 
country than a temperate one. But you must 
not overdo your alcohol. I have seen a gay 
young spark, a fine soldier, and over six feet io 
height, drink eight pegs of a morning, ere he got 



2i8 CAKES AND ALE 

out of bed. There was no such thing as a " split 
soda " — or a split brandy either — in those days. 
We buried him in the Bay of Bengal just after a 
cyclone, on our way home. 

By the way, the real meaning of " peg " was 
said to be the peg, or nail, driven into the coffin 
of the drinker every time he partook. And the 
coffin of many an Anglo-Indian of my acquaint- 
ance was all nails. A 

yohn Collins 

is simply a gin-sling with a little cura^oa in it. 
That is to say, soda-water, a slice of lemon, 
cura^oa — and gin. But by alt^ering the pro- 
portions this can be made a very dangerous potion 
indeed. The officers of a certain regiment — 
which shall be nameless — were in the habit of 
putting this potion on tap, after dinner on a 
guest night. It was a point of honour in those 
evil, though poetical, times, to send no guest 
empty away, and more than one of those enter- 
tained by this regiment used to complain next 
morning at breakfast — a peg, or a swizzle, and a 
hot pickle sandwich — of the escape of " Private 
John Collins " from the regimental guard-room. 
For towards dawn there would not be much 
soda-water in that potion — which was usually 
served hot at that hour.

I SUPPOSE there are almost as many recipes for 
claret cup as for a cold in the head. And of 
the many it is probable that the greater propor- 
tion will produce a cup which will neither cheer 
nor inebriate ; for the simple reason that nobody, 
who was not inebriated already, would be phy- 
sically capable of drinking enough of it. Let us 

first of all take the late Mr. Donald's recipe for 




120 CAKES AND ALE 

Claret Cup : 

A. I bottle claret. 

1 wine-glassful fine pale brandy. 
\ do. chartreuse yellow. 
J do. cura9oa. 

\ do. maraschino. 

2 bottles soda or seltzer.^ 

I lemon, cut in thin slices. 

A few sprigs of borage ; not much. 

Ice and sugar to taste. 

Here is a less expensive recipe : 

B, Put into a bowl the rind of one lemon pared 
very thin, add some sifted sugar, and pour over it a 
wine-glassful of sherry ; then add a bottle of claret, 
more sugar to taste, a sprig of verbena, one bottle of 
aerated water, and a grated nutmeg ; strain and ice 
it well. 

Once more let the fact be emphasised that the 
better the wine, spirit, etc., the better the cup. 

Here is a good cup for Ascot, when the sun 
is shining, and you are entertaining the fair sex. 

C Put in a large bowl three bottles of claret (St. 
Estephe is the stamp of wine), a wine-glassful (large) 
of cura^oa, a pint of dry sherry, half a pint of old 
brandy, a large wine-glassful of raspberry syrup, three 
oranges and one lemon cut into slices ; add a few 
sprigs of borage and a little cucumber rind, two 
bottles of seltzer water, and three bottles of Stretton 
water. Mix well, and sweeten. Let it stand for an

be widely known, and are superior to most of the foreign ones 



CUPS AND CORDIALS zii 

hour, and then strain. Put in a large block of ice, and 
a few whole strawberries. Serve in small tumblers. 

Another way and a simpler : 

D. Pour into a large jug one bottle of claret, add 
two wine-glassfuls of sherry, and half a glass of maras- 
chino. Add a few sliced nectarines, or peaches, and 
sugar to taste (about a table-spoonful and a half). 
Let it stand till the sugar is dissolved, then put in a 
sprig of borage. Just before using add one bottle of 
Stretton water, and a large piece of ice. 

My ideal claret cup : 

E. 2 bottles Pontet Canet. 
2 wine-glassfuls old brandy. 
I wine-glassful cura^oa. 

1 pint bottle sparkling moselle, 

2 bottles aerated water. 

A sprig or two of borage, and a little lemon peel. 
Sugar ad lib, : one cup will not require much. 
Add the moselle and popwater just before using ; 
then put in a large block of ice. 

Those who have never tried can have no idea 
of the zest which a small proportion of moselle 
lends to a claret cup. 

My earliest recollection of a cup dates from old 
cricketing days beneath " Henry's holy shade," 
on " a match day " — as poor old " Spanky " used 
to phrase it ; a day on which that prince of 
philosophers and confectioners sold his wares for 
cash only. Not that he had anything to do 
with the compounding of the 

Cider Cup. 
Toast a slice of bread and put it at the bottom of 



lit CAKES AND ALE 

a. large jug. Grate over the toast nearly half a small 
nutmeg, and a very little ginger. Add a little thin 
lemon rind, and six lumps of sugar. Then add two 
wine-glasses of sherry, and (if for adults) one of brandy. 
(If for boys the brandy in the sherry will suffice.) 
Add also the juice of a small lemon, two bottles of 
lively water, and (last of all) three pints of cider. 
Mix well, pop in a few sprigs of borage, and a block 
or two of ice. 

Remember once more that the purer the 
cider the better will be the cup. There is an 
infinity of bad cider in the market. There used 
to be a prejudice against the fermented juice of 
the apple for all who have gouty tendencies ; 
but as a " toe-martyr " myself, I can bear testi- 
mony to the harmlessness of the " natural " 
Norfolk cider made at Attleborough, in the which 
is no touch of Podagra. 

For a good 

Champagne Cup 

vide Claret Cup J. Substituting the " sparkling " 
for the "ruby," the ingredients are precisely the 
same. 

A nice, harmless beverage, suitable for a tennis 
party, or to accompany the " light refreshments " 
served at a " Cinderella " dance, or at the " break- 
ing-up " party at a ladies' school, is 

Chablis Cup. 

Dissolve four or five lumps of sugar in a quarter of 
a pint of boiling water, and put it into a bowl with 
a very thin sJ'ce of lemon rind ; let it stand for half- 
an-hour, then add a bottle of chablis, a sprig of ver- 
bena, a wine-glassful of sherry, and half-a-pint of 



CUPS AND CORDIALS 223 

water. Mix well, and let the mixture stand for 
a while, then strain, add a bottle of seltzer water, a 
few strawberries or raspberries, and a block of ice. 
Serve in small glasses. 

Balaclava Cup, 

" Claret to right of 'em, 
' Simpkin ' to left of 'cm- 
Cup worth a hundred ! " 

Get a large bowl, to represent the Valley — which 
only the more rabid abstainer would call the " Valley 
of Death." You will next require a small detach- 
ment of thin lemon rind, about two table-spoonfuls of 
sifted sugar, the juice of two lemons, and half a 
cucumber, cut into thin slices, with the peel on. 
Let all these ingredients skirmish about within the 
bowl ; then bring up your heavy cavalry in the shape 
of two bottles of Chateau something, and one of the 
best champ:igne you have got. Last of all, unmask 
your soda-water battery ; two bottles will be sufficient. 
Ice, and serve in tumblers. 

Crimean Cup, 

This is a very serious affair. So was the w^ar. 
The cup, however, leads to more favourable 
results, and does not, like the campaign, leave a 
bitter taste in the mouth. Here are the in- 
gredients : 

One quart of syrup of orgeat (to make this vide 
next recipe), one pint and a half of old brandy, half 
a pint of maraschino, one pint of old rum, two large 
and one small bottles of champagne, three bottles of 
Seltzer-water, half-a-pound of sifted sugar, and the 
juice of five lemons. Peel the lemons, and put the 
thin rind in a mortar, with the sugar. Pound them 



ZZ4 CAK-ES AND ALE 

well, and scrape the result with a silver spoon into 
a large bowl. Squeeze in the juice of the lemons, 
add the seltzer water, and stir till the sugar is quite 
dissolved. Then add the orgeat, and whip the 
mixture well with a whisk, so as to whiten it. Add 
the maraschino, rum, and brandy, and strain the whole 
into another bowl. Just before the cup is required, 
put in the champagne, and stir vigorously with a 
punch ladle. The champagne should be well iced, 
as no apparent ice is allowable in this mixture. 

Orgeat. 

Blanch and pound three-quarters of a pound of 
sweet almonds, and thirty bitter almonds, in one 
table-spoonful of water. Stir in by degrees two pints 
of water and three pints of milk. Strain the mixture 
through a cloth. Dissolve half-a-pound of loaf 
sugar in one pint of water. Boil and skim well, and 
then mix with the almond water. Add two table- 
spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and half-a-pint of 
old brandy. Be careful to boil the eau sucre well, as 
this concoction must not be too watery. 

Ascot Cup. 

Odds can be laid freely on this ; and the host 
should stay away from the temptations of the 
betting-ring, on purpose to make it. And — 
parenthetically be it observed — the man who has 
no soul for cup-making should never entertain at 
a race meeting. The servants will have other 
things to attend to ; and even if they have not 
it should be remembered that a cup, or punch, 
like a salad, should always, if possible, be mixed 
by some one who is going to partake of the 
same. 



CUPS AND CORDIALS zi^ 

Dissolve six ounces of sugar in half-a-pint of 
boiling water ; add the juice of three lemons, one 
pint of old brandy, a wine-glassful of cherry brandy, 
a wine-glassful of maraschino, half a wine-glassful of 
yellow chartreuse, two bottles of champagne. All 
these should be mixed in a large silver bowl Add 
a few sprigs of borage, a few slices of lemon, half-a- 
dozen strawberries, half-a-dozen brandied cherries, 
and three bottles of seltzer water. Put the bowl, 
having first covered it over, into the refrigerator for 
one hour, and before serving, put a small iceberg 
into the mixture, which should be served in little 
tumblers. 

How many people, I wonder, are aware that 

Champagne and Guinness^ Stout 

make one of the best combinations possible .? 
You may search the wide wide world for a 
cookery book which will give this information ; 
but the mixture is both grateful and strengthen- 
ing, and is, moreover, far to be preferred to what 
is known as 

Rich Mans Shandy Gaf^ 

which is a mixture of champagne and ale. The 
old Irishman said that the " blackgyard " should 
never be placed atop of the " gintleman," intend- 
ing to convey the advice that ale should not 
be placed on the top of champagne. But the 
" black draught " indicated just above is well 
worth attention. It should be drunk out of a 
pewter tankard, and is specially recommended 
as a between-the-acts refresher for the amateur 
actor. 



226 CAKES AND ALE 

^le Cup, 

Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a round of hot 
toast ; lay on it a thin piece of the rind, a table- 
spoonful of pounded sugar, a little grated nutmeg, 
and a sprig of balm. Pour over these one glass of 
brandy, two glasses of sherry, and three pints of mild 
ale. Do not allow the balm to remain in the 
mixture many minutes. 

One of the daintiest of beverages is a 

Moselle Cup, 

Ingredients : One bottle of moselle. One glass 
of brandy. Four or five thin slices of pine-apple. 
The peel of half a lemon, cut very thin. Ice ; and 
sugar ad lib. Just before using add one bottle of 
sparkling water. 

Sherry Cobbler 

although a popular drink in America, is but little 
known on this side of the Atlantic. Place in a soda- 
water tumbler two wine-glassfuls of sherry, one table- 
spoonful of sifted sugar, and two or three slices of 
orange. Fill the tumbler with crushed ice, and shake 
well. Drink through straws. 

Champagne Cobbler, 

Put into a large tumbler one table -spoonful of 
sifted sugar, with a thin paring of lemon and orange 
peel ; fill the tumbler one-third full of crushed ice, 
and the remainder with champagne. Shake, and 
ornament with a slice of lemon, and a strawberry or 
two. Drink through straws.

Home Ruler, 

This was a favourite drink at the bars of the 
House of Commons, during the reign of the 
Uncrowned King. It was concocted of the yolks of 
two raw eggs, well beaten, a little sugar added, then 
a tumbler of hot milk taken gradually into the 
mixture, and last of all a large wine-glassful of " J. J." 
whisky. 

Cordials, 

In treating of cordials, it is most advisable that 
they be home made. The bulk of the cherry 
brandy, ginger brandy, etc., which is sold over 
the counter is made with inferior brandy 5 and 
frequently the operation of blending the virtue of 
the fruit with the spirit has been hurried. 

We will commence with the discussion of the 
favourite cordial of all, 

Cherry Brandy, 

This can either be made from Black Gean 
cherries, or Morellas, but the latter are better for 
the purpose. Every pound of cherries will require 
one quarter of a pound of white sugar, and one pint 
of the best brandy. The cherries, with the sugar 
well mixed with them, should be placed in wide- 
mouthed bottles, filled up with brandy ; and if the 
fruit be previously pricked, the mixture will be 
ready in a month. But a better blend is procured 
if the cherries are untouched, and this principle holds 
good with all fruit treated in this way, and left 
corked for at least three months. 

Sloe Gin, 

For years the sloe, which is the fruit of the 
black-thorn, was used in England for no other 



lis CAKES AiSfD ALE 

purpose than the manufacture of British Port. 
But at this end of the nineteenth century, the 
pubHc have been, and are, taking kindly to the 
cordial, which for a long time had been despised 
as an " auld wife's drink." As a matter of fact, 
it is just as tasty, and almost as luscious as cherry 
brandy. But since sloe gin became fashionable, 
it has become almost impossible for dwellers 
within twenty or thirty miles of London to make 
the cordial at home. For sloes fetch something 
like sixpence or sevenpence a pound in the market j 
and in consequence the hedgerows are " raided " 
by the (otherwise) unemployed, the fruit being 
usually picked before the proper time, i.e. when 
the frost has been on it. The manufacture of sloe 
gin is as simple as that of cherry brandy. 

All that IS necessary to be done is to allow i 
lb. of sugar (white) to i lb. of sloes. Half fill 
a bottle — which need not necessarily be a wide- 
mouthed one — with sugared fruit, and "top up" 
with gin. If the sloes have been pricked, the liquor 
will be ready for use in two or three months ; but 
c^o not hurry it. 

In a year's time the gin will havfe eaten all the 
goodness out of the unpricked fruit, and it is in 
this gradual blending that the secret (as before 
observed) of making these cordials Hes. As a 
rule, if you call for sloe gin at a licensed house of 
entertainment, you will get a ruby -coloured 
Hquid, tasting principally of gin — and not good 
gin "at that" This is because the making has 
been hurried. Properly matured sloe gin should 
be the colour of full-bodied port wine. 



CUPS AND CORDIALS 229 

Apricot Brandy. 

This is a cordial which is but seldom met with 
in this country. To every pound of fruit (which 
should not be quite ripe) allow one pound of 
loaf sugar. Put the apricots into a preserving-pan, 
with sufficient water to cover them. Let them 
boil up, and then simmer gently until tender. 
Remove the skins. Clarify and boil the sugar, then 
pour it over the fruit. Let it remain twenty-four 
hours. Then put the apricots into wide-mouthed 
bottles, and fill them up with syrup and brandy, 
half and half. Cork them tightly, with the tops of 
corks sealed. This apricot brandy should be pre- 
pared in the month of July, and kept twelve months 
before using. 

Highland Cordial, 

Here is another rare old recipe. Ingredients, 
one pint of white currants, stripped of their stalks, 
the thin rind of a lemon, one teaspoonful of essence 
of ginger, and one bottle of old Scotch whisky. 
Let the mixture stand for forty-eight hours, and 
then strain through a hair sieve. Add one pound of 
loaf sugar, which will take at least a day to thoroughly 
dissolve. Then bottle off, and cork well. It will 
be ready for use in three months, but will keen 
longer. 

Bitters, 

One ounce of Seville orange-peel, half an ounce 
of gentian root, a quarter of an ounce of cardamoms. 
Husk the cardamoms, and crush them with the 
gentian root. Put them in a wide-mouthed bottle, 
and cover with brandy or whisky. Let the mixture 
remain for twelve days, then strain, and bottle off 
for use, after adding one ounce of lavender drops. 



Z30 CAKES AND ALE 



Ginger Brandy, 

Bruise slightly two pounds of black currants, 
and mix them with one ounce and a half of ground 
ginger. Pour over them one bottle and a half of 
best brandy, and let the mixture stand for two days. 
Strain off the liquid, and add one pound of loaf sugar 
which has been boiled to a syrup in a little water. 
Bottle and cork closely. 

^^ Jumping Powder^ 

comes in very handy, on a raw morning, after 
you have ridden a dozen miles or so to a 
lawn meet. " No breakfast, thanks, just a wee 
nip, that's all." And the ever ready butler hands 
round the tray. If you are wise, you will declare 
on 



Orange Brandy 



which, as a rule, is well worth sampling, in a 
house important enough to entertain hunting 
men. And orange brandy "goes" much better 
than any other liqueur, or cordial, before noon. 

It should be made in the month of March. 
Take the thin rinds of six Seville oranges, and put 
them into a stone jar, with half-a-pint of the strained 
juice, and two quarts of good old brandy. Let it 
remain three days, then add one pound and a quarter 
of loaf sugar — broken, not pounded — and stir till 
the sugar is dissolved. Let the liquor stand a day, 
strain it through paper till quite clear, pour into 
bottles, and cork tightly. The longer it is kept the 
better.

CHAPTER XX 

THE DAYLIGHT DRINK 

" Something too much of this." 
" A nipping and an eager air." 

Evil effects of dram-drinking — The " Gin-crawl " — Abstinence 
in H.M. service — City manners and customs — Useless to 
argue with the soaker — Cocktails — Pet names for drams — 
The free lunch system — Fancy mixtures — Why no Cassis ? 
— Good advice like water on a duck's back. 

Whilst holding the same opinion as the epicure 
who declared that good eating required good drink- 
ing, there is no question but that there should 
be a limit to both. There is, as Shakespeare 
told us, a tide in the affairs of man, so why should 
there not be in this particular affair ? Why 
should it be only ebb tide during the few hours 
that the man is wrapped in the arms of a 
Bacchanalian Morpheus, either in bed or in 
custody ? The abuse of good liquor is surely as 
criminal a folly as the abstention therefrom ; and 
the man who mixes his liquors injudiciously 
/acks that refinement of taste and understanding 



THE DAYLIGHT DRINK 233 

which is necessary for the appreciation of a good 
deal of this book, or indeed of any other useful 
volume. Our grandfathers swore terribly, and 
drank deep ; but their fun did not commence 
until after dinner. And they drank, for the 
most part, the best of ale, and such port wine as 
is not to be had in these days of free trade 
(which is only an euphemism for adulteration) 
and motor cars. Although mine own teeth are, 
periodically, set on edge by the juice of the grape 
consumed by an ancestor or two ; although the 
gout within me is an heritage from the three-, 
aye ! and four-, bottle era, I respect mine ancestors, 
in that they knew not " gin and bitters." The 
baleful habit of alcoholising the inner sinner be- 
tween meal times, the pernicious habit of dram- 
drinking, or "nipping," from early morn till 
dewy eve, was not introduced into our cities 
until the latter half of the nineteenth century 
had set in. " Brandy-and-soda," at first only used 
as a " livener " — and a deadly livener it is — was 
unknown during the early Victorian era ; and 
the " gin-crawl," that interminable slouch around 
the hostelries, is a rank growth of modernity. 

The "nipping habit" came to us, with other 
pernicious "notions," from across the Atlantic 
Ocean. It was Brother Jonathan who established 
the bar system ; and although for the most part, 
throughout Great Britain, the alcohol is dis- 
pensed by young ladies with fine eyes and a 
great deal of adventitious hair, and the " bar- 
keep," with his big watch chain, and his " guns," 
placed within easy reach, for quick-shooting 
jaloon practice, is unknown on this side, the 



234 CAKES AND ALE 

hurt of the system (to employ an Americanism) 
"gets there just the same." There is not the 
same amount of carousing in the British army 
as in the days when I was a " gilded popinjay " 
(in the language of Mr. John Burns ; "a five- 
and-twopenny assassin," in the words of some- 
body else). In those days the use of alcohol, if 
not absolutely encouraged for the use of the 
subaltern, was winked at by his superiors, as 
long as the subalterns were not on duty, or on 
the line of march — and I don't know so much 
about the line of march, eithe. But with any 
orderly or responsible duty to be done, the 
beverage of heroes was not admired. " Now 
mind," once observed our revered colonel, in the 
ante-room, after dinner, " none of you young 
officers get seeing snakes and things, or otherwise 
rendering yourselves unfit for service ; or Fll try 

the lot of you by court martial, I will, by ." 

Here the adjutant let the regimental bible drop 
with a bang. Tea is the favourite ante-room 
refreshment nowadays, when the officer, young 
or old, is always either on duty, or at school. 
And the education of the modern warrior is never 
completed. 

But the civilian — sing ho! the wicked 
civilian — is a reveller, and a winebibber, for the 
most part. Very little business is transacted 
except over what is called "a friendly glass." 
" I want seven hundred an' forty-five from you, 
old chappie," says Reggie de Beers of the "House," 
on settHng day. "Right," replies his friend 
young " Berthas " : " toss you double or quits. 
Down with it ! " And it would be a cold day 



THE DAYLIGHT DRINK 235 

were not a magnum or two of " the Boy " to be 
opened over the transaction. The cheap eating- 
house keeper who has spent his morning at the 
"market," cheapening a couple of pigs, or a dozen 
scraggy fowls, will have spent double the money 
he has saved in the bargain, in rum and six- 
penny ale, ere he gets home again ; and even a 
wholesale deal in evening journals, between two 
youths in the street, requires to be " wetted." 
Very sad is it not ? But, as anything which I 
— who am popularly supposed to be something 
resembling a roysterer, but who am in reality one 
of the most discreet of those who enjoy life — can 
write is not likely to work a change in the 
system which obtains amongst English-speaking 
nations, perhaps the sooner I get on with the 
programme the better. Later on I may revert 
to the subject. 

Amongst daylight (and midnight, for the 
matter of that) drinks, the Cocktail, that 
fascinating importation from Dollarland, holds a 
prominent place. This is a concoction for 
which, with American bars all over the Metro- 
polis, the cockney does not really require any 
recipe. But as I trust to have some country 
readers, a few directions may be appended. 

Brandy Cocktail, 

One wine-glassful of old brandy, six drops of 
angostura bitters, and twenty drops of cura^oa, in

a small silver tumbler — shake, and pour into glass 
tumbler, then fill up with crushed ice. Put a shred

Put into a half-pint tumbler a couple of lumps 
of best ice, one teaspoonful of sifted sugar, one 
teaspoonful of orange bitters, half a wine-glassful of 
brandy. Top up with bottled cider, and mix with 
a spoon. Serve with a strawberry, and a sprig of 
verbena atop. 

Manhattan Cocktail. 

Half a wine-glassful of vermouth (Italian), hair 
a wine-glassful of rye whisky (according to the 
American recipe, though, personally, I prefer Scotch), 
ten drops of angostura bitters, and six drops of 
cura9oa. Add ice, shake well, and strain. Put a 
shred of lemon peel atop. 

Turn Turn Cocktail. 

Break the yolk of a new-laid egg into a small 
tumbler, and put a teaspoonful of sugar on it. 
Then six drops of angostura bitters, a wine-glassful 



THE DAYLIGHT DRINK 237 

of sherry, and half a wine-glassful of brandy. Shake 
all well together, and strain. Dust a very little 
cinnamon over the top. 

Gin Cocktail. 

Ten drops of angostura bitters, one wine-glassful 
of gin, ten drops of cura9oa, one shred of lemon 
peel. Fill up with ice, shake, and strain. 

Newport Cocktail. 

Put two lumps of ice and a small s/ke of lemon 
into the tumbler, add six drops of angostura bitters, 
half a wine-glassful of noyau, and a wine-glassful of 
brandy. Stir well, and serve with peel atop. 

Saratoga Cocktail. 

This is a more important affair, and requires a 
large tumbler for the initial stage. One teaspoonful 
of pine-apple syrup, ten drops of angostura bitters, 
one teaspoonful of maraschino, and a wine-glassful of 
old brandy. Nearly fill the tumbler with crushed 
ice, and shake well. Then place a couple of straw- 
berries in a small tumbler, strain the liquid on them, 
put in a strip of lemon peel, and top up with 
champagne. 

Whisky Cocktail. 

Put into a small tumbler ten drops of angostura 
bitters, and one wine-glassful of Scotch whisky. Fill 
the tumbler with crushed ice, shake well, strain 
into a large wine-glass, and place a strip of peel 
atop. 

But the ordinary British " bar-cuddler " — ^as 
he is called in the slang of the day — recks not of 
cocktails, nor, indeed, of Columbian combinations 



238 CAKES AND ALE 

of any sort. He has his own particular " vanity," 
and frequently a pet name for it. "Gin-and- 
angry-story" (angostura), " slow-and-old " (sloe- 
gin and Old Tom), "pony o' Burton, please 
miss," are a few of the demands the attentive 
listener may hear given. Orange-gin, gin-and- 
orange-gin, gin-and-sherry (O bile where is thy 
sting ? ), are favourite midday " refreshers " ; and 
I have heard a well-known barrister call for 
"a split Worcester" (a small wine-glassful of 
Worcester sauce with a split soda), without a 
smile on his expressive countenance. " Small lem. 
and a dash " is a favourite summer beverage, and, 
withal, a harmless one, consisting of a small 
bottle of lemonade with about an eighth of a 
pint of bitter ale added thereto. In one old- 
fashioned hostelry I wot of — the same in which 
the chair of the late Doctor Samuel Johnson is 
on view — customers who require to be stimulated 
with gin call for "rack," and Irish whisky is 
known by none other name than " Cork." The 
habitual " bar-cuddler " usually rubs his hands 
violently together, as he requests a little attention 
from the presiding Hebe ; and affects a sort of 
shocked surprise at the presence on the scene of 
any one of his friends or acquaintances. He is 
well-up, too, in the slang phraseology of the day, 
which he will ride to death on every available 
opportunity. Full well do I remember him in 
the " How's your poor feet ? " era ; and it seems 
but yesterday that he was informing the company 
in assertive tones, " Now we shant be long ! " 
The " free lunch " idea of the Yankees is only 
thoroughly carried out in the " North Countree^" 



THE DAYLIGHT DRINK 139 

where, at the best hotels, there is often a great 
bowl of soup, or a dish of jugged hare, or of 
Irish stew, pro bono publico; and by publico is 
implied the hotel directorate as well as the 
customers. In London, however, the free lunch 
seldom soars above salted almonds, coffee beans, 
cloves, with biscuits and American cheese. But 
at most refreshment-houses is to be obtained for 
cash some sort of a restorative sandwich, or bonne 
bouche^ in the which anchovies and hard-boiled 
eggs play leading parts ; and amongst other re- 
storative food, I have noticed that parallelograms 
of cold Welsh rarebit are exceedingly popular 
amongst wine-travellers and advertisement-agents. 
The genius who propounded the statement that 
"there is nothing Hke leather" could surely 
never have sampled a cold Welsh rarebit ! 

Bosom Caresser, 

Put into a small tumbler one wine-glassful of sherry, 
half a wine-glassful of old brandy, the yolk of an egg, 
two teaspoonfuls of sugar, and two grains of cayenne 
pepper ; add crushed ice, shake well, strain, and 
dust over with nutmeg and cinnamon. 

A Nicobine^ 

(or " Knickerbein " as I have seen it spelt), used 
to be a favourite "short" drink in Malta, and 
consisted of the yolk of an egg (intact) in a 
wine-glass with layers of cura^oa, maraschino, 
and green chartreuse ; the liquors not allowed to 
mix with one another. The "knickerbein" 
recipe differs materially from this, as brandy is 



240 CAKES ANU ALE 

substituted for chartreuse, and the ingredients 
are shaken up and strained, the white of the egg 
being whisked and placed atop. But, either way, 
you will get a good, bile -provoking mixture. 
In the 

West Indies^ 

if you thirst for a rum and milk, cocoa-nut milk 
is the "only wear"; and a very delicious potion 
it is. A favourite mixture in Jamaica was the 
juice of a " star " apple, the juice of an orange, 
a wine-glassful of sherry, and a dust of nutmeg. 
I never heard a name given to this. 

BulPs Milk. 

This is a comforting drink for summer or 
winter. During the latter season, instead of 
adding ice, the mixture may be heated. 

One teaspoonful of sugar in a large tumbler, half- 
a-pint of milk, half a wine-glassful of rum, a wine- 
glassful of brandy ; add ice, shake well, strain, and 
powder with cinnamon and nutmeg. 

Fairy Kiss. 

Put into a small tumbler the juice of a quarter of 
lemon, a quarter of a wine-glassful each of the follow- 
ing : — Vanilla syrup, cura^oa, yellow chartreuse, 
brandy. Add ice, shake, and strain. 

Flash of Lightning, 

One-third of a wine-glassful each of the following, 
in a small tumbler : — Raspberry syrup, cura9oa, 
brandy, and three drops of angostura bitters. Add 
ice, shake and strain. 



THE Daylight brink: 241 

Flip Flap, 

One wine-glassful of milk in a small tumbler, one 
well-beaten egg, a little sugar, and a wine-glassful of 
port. Ice, shake, strain, and sprinkle with cinna- 
mon and nutmeg. 

Maiden's Blush, 

Half a wine-glassful of sherry in a small tumbler, a 
quarter of a wine-glassful of strawberry syrup, and a 
little lemon juice. Add ice, and a little raspberry 
syrup. Shake, and drink through straws. 

J thole Brose 

is compounded, according to a favourite author, 
in the following manner : — 

" Upon virgin honeycombs you pour, according 
to their amount, the oldest French brandy and the 
most indisputable Scotch whisky in equal pro- 
portions. You allow this goodly mixture to stand 
for days in a large pipkin in a cool place, and it is 
then strained and ready for drinking. Epicures 
drop into the jug, by way of imparting artistic 
finish, a small fragment of the honeycomb itself. 
This I deprecate." 

Tiger's Milk. 

Small tumbler. Half a wine-glassful each of cider 
and Irish whisky, a wine-glassful of peach brandy. 
Beat up separately the white of an egg with a little 
sugar, and add this. Fill up the tumbler with ice ; 
shake, and strain. Add half a tumbler of milk, and 
grate a little nutmeg atop. 

Wyndham, 
Large tumbler. Equal quantities (a liqueur glass 



24-2 CAKES AND ALE 

of each) of maraschino, cura9oa, brandy, with a little 
orange peel, and sugar. Add a glass of champagne, 
and a small bottle of seltzer water. Ice, and mix 
well together. Stir with a spoon. 

Happy Eliza. 

Put into a skillet twelve fresh dried figs cut open, 
four apples cut into slices without peeling, and half 
a pound of loaf sugar, broken small. Add two quarts 
of water, boil for twenty minutes, strain through a 
— where's the brandy ? Stop ! I've turned over 
two leaves, and got amongst the Temperance Drinks. 
Rein back ! 

Mint Julep, 

This, properly made, is the most delicious of all 
American beverages. It is mixed in a large tumbler, 
in the which are placed, first of all, two and a half 
table - spoonfuls of water, one table - spoonful of 
sugar (crushed), and two or three sprigs of mint, 
which should be pressed, with a spoon or crusher, 
into the sugar and water to extract the flavour. 
Add two wine-glassfuls of old brandy — now we 
shan*t be long — fill up with powdered ice, shake 
well, get the mint to the top of the tumbler, stalks 
down, and put a few strawberries and slices of 
orange atop. Shake in a little rum, last of all, 
and drink through straws. 

Possets. 

(An eighteenth-century recipe.) 

"Take three gills of sweet cream, a grated rind 
of lemon, and juice thereof, three-quarters of a pint 
of sack or Rhenish wine. Sweeten to your taste 
with loaf sugar, then beat in a bowl with a whisk 



THE DAYLIGHT DRINK 243 

for one hour, and fill your glasses and drink to the 
king." 

We are tolerably loyal in this our time j still 
it is problematical if there exist man or woman 
in Merry England, in our day who would whisk 
a mixture for sixty minutes by the clock, even 
with the prospect of drinking to the reigning 
monarch. 

Brandy Sour, 

This is simplicity itself. A tea-spoonful of sifted 
sugar in a small tumbler, a little lemon rind and 
juice, one wine-glassful of brandy. Fill nearly up 
with crushed ice, shake and strain. Whisky Sour is 
merely Scotch whisky treated in the same kind, 
open-handed manner, with the addition of a few 
drops of raspberry syrup. 

Blue Blazer. 

Don't be frightened ; there is absolutely no 
danger. Put into a silver mug, or jug, previously 
heated, two wine-glassfuls of overproof (or proof) 
Scotch whisky, and one wine-glassful oi boiling water. 
Set the liquor on fire, and pass the blazing liquor 
into another mug, also well heated. Pass to and 
fro, and serve in a tumbler, with a lump of sugar 
and a little thin lemon peel. Be very particular not 
to drop any of the blazer on the cat, or the hearth- 
rug, or the youngest child. This drink would, T 
should think, have satisfied the aspirations of Mr. 
Daniel 2^ilp. 

One of the most wholesome of all "re- 
freshers," is a simple liquor, distilled from black- 
currants, and known to our lively neighbours 
as 



244 CAKES AND ALE 

Cassts, 

This syrup can be obtained in the humblest 
cabaret in France ; but we have to thank the 
eccentric and illogical ways of our Customs 
Department for its absence from most of our own 
wine lists. The duty is so prohibitive — being 
half as much again as that levied on Frenr,h 
brandy — that it would pay nobody but said 
Customs Department to import it into England ; 
and yet the amount of alcohol contained in cassis 
is infinitesimal. Strange to say nobody has ever 
started a cassis still on this side. One would 
imagine that the process would be simplicity 
itself J as the liquor is nothing but cold black- 
currant tea, with a suspicion of alcohol in it. 

Sligo Slop, 

This is an Irish delight. The juice of ten 
lemons, strained, ten table-spoonfuls of sifted sugar, 
one quart of John Jameson's oldest and best whisky, 
and two port wine-glassfuls of cura9oa, all mixed to- 
gether. Let the mixture stand for a day or two, 
and then bottle. This should be drunk neat, in 
liqueur -glasses, and is said to be most effectual 
"jumping-powder." It certainly reads conducive to 
timber-topping. 

Take it altogether the daylight drink is a 
mistake. It is simply ruin to appetite j it is 
more expensive than those who indulge therein 
are aware of at the time. It ruins the nerves, 
sooner or later ; it is not conducive to business, 
unless for those whose heads are especially hard ; 
and it spoils the palate for the good wine which 



THE DAYLIGHT DRINK 245 

is poured forth later on. The precept cannot be 
too widely laid down, too fully known : 

Do not drink between Meals ! 

Better, far better the three-bottle-trick of our 
ancestors, than the " gin-crawl " of to-day. 



CHAPTER XXI 

GASTRONOMY IN FICTION AND DRAMA 

" Let me not burst in ignorance. " 
" A chiel's amang ye, taking notes." 

Thomas Carlyle — Thackeray — Harrison Ains worth — Sir Walter 
Scott— Miss Brad<Jon— Marie Corelli— F. C. Philips— Black- 
more — Charles Dickens — Pickiuick reeking with alcohol 
— Brandy and oysters — Little Dorrit — Great Expectations — 
Micawber as a punch-maker — David Cv^perjield — " Prac- 
ticable" food on the stage — "Johnny" Toole's story of Tiny 
Tim and the goose. 

Considering the number of books which have 
been published during the nineteenth century, it is 
astonishing how few of them deal with eating 
and drinking. We read of a banquet or two, 
certainly, in the works of the divine William, 
but no particulars as to the cuisine are entered 
into. " Cold Banquo " hardly sounds appetising. 
Thomas Carlyle was a notorious dyspeptic, so it 
is no cause for wonderment that he did not 
bequeath to posterity the recipes for a dainty 
dish or two, or a good Derby Day " Cup." 
Thackeray understood but little about cookery. 



GASTRONOMY IN FICTION AND DRAMA 247 

nor was Whyte Melville much better versed in 
the mysteries of the kitchen. Harrison Ains- 
w^orth touched lightly on gastronomy occa- 
sionally, w^hilst Charles Lamb, Sydney Smith, 
and others (blessings light on the man who in- 
vented the phrase "and others") delighted 
therein. Miss Braddon has slurred it over 
hitherto, and Marie Corelli scorns all mention 
of any refreshment but absinthe — a weird Hquid 
which is altogether absent from these pages. In 
the lighter novels of Mr. F. C. Philips, there is 
but little mention of solid food except devilled 
caviare, which s6unds nasty ; but most of Mr. 
Philips's men, and all his women, drink to excess — 
principally champagne, brandy, and green char- 
treuse. And one of his heroines is a firm 
behever in the merits of cognac as a " settler " of 
champagne. 

According to Mr. R. D. Blackmore, the natives 
of Exmoor did themselves particularly well, in the 
seventeenth century. In that most delightful 
romance Lorna Doone is a description of a meal 
set before Tom Faggus, the celebrated highway- 
man, by the Ridd family, at Plover's Barrows : — 

"A few oysters first, and then dried salmon, and 
then ham and eggs, done in small curled rashers, 
and then a few collops of venison toasted, and next 
a little cold roast pig, and a woodcock on toast to 
finish with." 

This meal was washed down with home- 
brewed ale, followed by Schiedam and hot water. 

One man, and one man alone, who has left 
his name printed deep on the sands of time 
as a writer, thoroug;hly revelled in the mighty 



248 CAKES AND ALE 

subjects of eating and drinking. Need his name 
be mentioned ? What is, after all, the great 
secret of the popularity of 

Charles Dickens 

as a novelist ? His broad, generous views on the 
subject of meals, as expressed through the 
mouths of most of the characters in his works ; 
as also the homely nature of such meals, and 
the good and great deeds to which they led. 
I once laid myself out to count the number of 
times that alcoholic refreshment is mentioned 
in some of the principal works of the great 
author ; and the record, for Pickwick alone, was 
sufficient to sweep from the surface of the earth, 
with its fiery breath, the entire Blue Ribbon 
Army. Mr. Pickwick was what would be 
called nowadays a " moderate drinker." That is 
to say, he seldom neglected an "excuse for a 
lotion," nor did he despise the " daylight drink." 
But we only read of his being overcome by his 
potations on two occasions ; after the cricket 
dinner at Muggleton, and after the shooting 
luncheon on Captain Boldwig's ground. And 
upon the latter occasion I am convinced that the 
hot sun had far more to do with his temporary 
obfuscation than the cold punch. Bob Sawyer 
and Ben Allen were by no means exaggerated 
types of the medical students of the time. The 
" deputy sawbones " of to-day writes pamphlets, 
drinks coffee, and pays his landlady every 
Saturday. And it was a happy touch of Dickens 
to make Sawyer and Allen eat oysters, and wash 
them down with neat brandy, before breakfast. 



GASTRONOMY IN FICTION AND DRAMA 249 

I have known medical students, aye ! and full- 
blown surgeons too, who would commit equally 
daring acts ; although I doubt much if they 
would have shone at the breakfast-table after- 
WLrds, or on the ice later in the day. For the 
effect exercised by brandy on oysters is pretty 
well known to science. 

Breathes there a man with soul so dead as not 
to appreciate the delights of Dingley Dell ? Free 
trade and other horrors have combined to crush 
the British yeoman of to-day ; but we none the 
less delight to read of him as he was, and I do 
not know a better cure for an attack of " blue 
devils " — or should it be " black dog ? " — than a 
good dose of Dingley Dell. The wholesale 
manner in which Mr. Wardle takes possession 
of the Pickwickians — only one of whom he 
knows intimately — for purposes of entertain- 
ment, is especially delightful, and worthy of 
imitation ; and I can only regret the absence 
of a good, cunningly - mixed " cup " at the 
picnic after the Chatham review. The wine 
drunk at this picnic would seem to have been 
sherry ; as there was not such a glut of " the 
sparkling" in those good old times. And the 
prompt way in which " Emma'* is commanded 
to " bring out the cherry brandy," before his 
guests have been two minutes in the house, 
bespeaks the character of dear old Wardle in 
once. " The Leathern Bottle," a charming old- 
world hostelry in that picturesque country lying 
between Rochester and Cobham, would hardly 
have been in existence now, let alone doing a 
roaring trade, but for the publication of Pick^

wick; and the notion of the obese Tupman 
solacing himself for blighted hopes and taking 
his leave of the world on a diet of roast fowl 
bacon, ale, etc., is unique. The bill-of-fare at 
the aforementioned shooting luncheon might 
not, perhaps, satisfy the aspirations of Sir Mota 
Kerr, or some other nouveau r'lche of to-day, but 
there was plenty to eat and drink. Here is the 
list, in Mr. Samuel Weller's own words : 

" Weal pie, tongue : a wery good thing when 
it ain't a woman's : bread, knuckle o' ham, reg'lar 
picter, cold beef in slices ; wery good. What's 
in them stone jars, young touch-and-go ? " 

"Beer in this one," replied the boy, taking 
from his shoulder a couple of large stone bottles, 
fastened together by a leathern strap, "cold punch 
in t'other." 

"And a wery good notion of a lunch it is, 
take it altogether," said Mr. Weller. 

Possibly ; though cold beef in slices would be 
apt to get rather dryer than was desirable on a 
warm day. And milk punch hardly seems the 
sort of tipple to encourage accuracy of aim. 

Mrs. Bardell's notion of a nice little supper 
we gather from the same immortal work, was "a 
couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese." 
The pettitoes were presumably simmered in milk, 
and the cheese was, undoubtedly, " browning away 
most delightfully in a little Dutch oven in front of 
the fire." Most of us will smack our lips after this 
description ; though details are lacking as to the 
contents of the " black bottle " which was pro- 
duced from "a small closet." But amongst students 
of Pickwick^ " Old Tom " is a hot favourite. 



GASTRONOxVIY IN FICTION AND DRAMA 251 

The Deputy Shepherd's particular "vanity" 
appears to have been buttered toast and reeking 
hot pine-apple rum and water, v^^hich sounds like 
swimming-in-the-head i and going straight 
through the book, we next pause at the de- 
scription of the supper given by the medical 
students, at their lodgings in the Borough, to 
the Pickwickians. 

" The man to whom the order for the oysters 
had been sent had not been told to open them ; 
it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with 
a limp knife or a two-pronged fork ; and very 
little was done in this way. Very little of the 
beef was done either; and the ham (which was 
from the German-sausage shop round the corner) 
was in a similar predicament. However, there 
was plenty of porter in a tin can ; and the cheese 
went a great way, for it was very strong." 

Probably the oysters had not been paid for in 
advance, and the man imagined that they would 
be returned upon his hands none the worse. For 
at that time — as has been remarked before, in 
this volume on gastronomy — the knowledge that 
an oyster baked in his own shells, in the middle 
of a clear fire, is an appetising dish, does not 
appear to have been universal. 

It is questionable if a supper consisting of a 
boiled leg of mutton "with the usual trimmings" 
would have satisfied the taste of the " gentleman's 
gentleman" of to-day, who is a hypercritic, if 
anything ; but let that supper be taken as read. 
Also let it be noted that the appetite of the 
redoubtable Pickwick never seems to have failed 

him, even in the sponging-house — five to one 

s

can be betted that those chops werc/ried — or in 
the Fleet Prison itself. And mention of thrs 
establishment recalls the extravagant folly of Job 
Trotter (who of all men ought to have know^n 
better) in purchasing "a small piece of raw^ loin 
of mutton " for the refection of himself and ruined 
master; v^^hen for the same money he could surely 
have obtained a sufficiency of bullock's cheek or 
liver, potatoes, and onions, to provide dinner for 
three days. Fide the " Kent Road Cookery," in 
one of my earlier chapters. The description of 
the journeys from Bristol to Birmingham, and 
back to London, absolutely reeks v^^ith food and 
alcohol ; and it has always smacked of the mys- 
terious to myself how Sam Weller, a pure Cock- 
ney, could have known so much of the capacities 
of the various hostelries on the road. Evidently 
his knowledge of other places besides London was 
" peculiar." Last scene of all in Pickwick requir- 
ing mention here, is the refection given to Mr. 
Solomon Pell in honour of the proving of the 
late Dame Weller's last will and testament. 
" Porter, cold beef, and oysters," were some of the 
incidents of that meal, and we read that " the 
coachman with the hoarse voice took an imperial 
pint of vinegar with his oysters, without betray- 
ing the least emotion." 

It is also set down that brandy and water, as 
usual in this history, followed the oysters ; but 
we are not told if any of those coachmen ever 
handled the ribbons again, or if Mr. Solomon 
Pell spent his declining days in the infirmary. 

In fact, there are not many chapters in Charles 
Dickens' works in which the knife and fork do 



GASTRONOMY IN FICTION AND DRAMA 253 

not play prominent parts. The food is, for the 
most part, simple and homely ; the seed sown in 
England by the fairy Jla had hardly begun 
to germinate at the time the novels were written. 
Still there is, naturally, a suspicion of Jla at the 
very commencement of Little Dorrit^ the scene 
being laid in the Marseilles prison, where Monsieur 
Rigaud feasts off Lyons sausage, veal in savoury 
jelly, white bread, strachino cheese, and good 
claret, the while his humble companion, Signor 
John Baptist, has to content himself with stale 
bread, through reverses at gambling with his 
fellow prisoner. After that, there is no mention 
of a " square meal " until we get to Mr. Casby's, 
the " Patriarch." " Everything about the patri- 
archal household," we are told, " promoted quiet 
digestion " j and the dinner mentioned began 
with " some soup, some fried soles, a butter-boat 
of shrimp sauce, and a dish of potatoes." Rare 
old Casby ! " Mutton, a steak, and an apple 
pie" — and presumably cheese — furnished the 
more solid portion of the banquet, which appears 
to have been washed down with porter and sherry 
wine, and enlivened by the inconsequent remarks 
of "Mr. F.'s Aunt." 

In Great Expectations occurs the celebrated 
banquet at the Chateau Gargery on Christmas 
Day, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and 
greens, a pair of roast stuffed fowls, a handsome 
mince pie, and a plum-pudding. The absence 
of the savoury pork- pie, and the presence of 
tar- water in the brandy are incidents at that 
banquet familiar enough to Sir Frank Lockwood, 
Q.C., M.P., and other close students of Dickens, 



254 CAKES AND ALE 

whose favourite dinner-dish would appear to have 
been a fowl, stuffed or otherwise, roast or boiled. 

In Oliver Twist we get casual mention of 
oysters, sheep's heads, and a rabbit pie, with 
plenty of alcohol ; but the bill of fare, on the 
whole, is not an appetising one. The meat and 
drink at the Maypole Hotel, in Barnahy Rudge^ 
would appear to have been deservedly popular ; 
and the description of Gabriel Varden's breakfast 
is calculated to bring water to the most callous 
mouth : 

"Over and above the ordinary tea equipage 
the board creaked beneath the weight of a jolly 
round of beef, a ham of the first magnitude, and 
sundry towers of buttered Yorkshire cake, piled 
slice upon slice in most alluring order. There 
was also a goodly jug of well- browned clay, 
fashioned into the form of an old gentleman not 
by any means unlike the locksmith, atop of whose 
bald head was a fine white froth answering to his 
wig, indicative, beyond dispute, of sparkling home 
brewed ale. But better than fair home-brewed, 
or Yorkshire cake, or ham, or beef, or anything to 
eat or drink that earth or air or water can supply, 
there sat, presiding over all, the locksmith's rosy 
daughter, before whose dark eyes even beef grew 
insignificant, and malt became as nothing." 

Ah-h-h ! 

There is not much eating in A Tale of Two 
Cities; but an intolerable amount of assorted 
"sack." In Sketches by Bo% we learn that 
Dickens had no great opinion of public dinners, 
and that oysters were, at that period, occasionally 
opened by the fair sex. There is a nice flavour 



GASTRONOMY IN FICTION AND DRAMA 255 

of fowl and old Madeira about Do?nbey and Son, 
and the description of the dinner at Doctor 
Blimber's establishment for young gentlemen is 
worth requoting : 

"There was some nice soup ; also roast meat, 
boiled meat, vegetables, pie, and cheese." [ Cheese 
at a small boys' school !] " Every young gentle- 
man had a massive silver fork and a napkin ; and 
all the arrangements were stately and handsome. 
In particular there was a butler in a blue coat and 
bright buttons" [surely this was a footman?] 
"who gave quite a winey flavour to the table 
beer, he poured it out so superbly." 

Dinner at Mrs. Jellyby's in Bleak House is 
one of the funniest and most delightful incidents 
in the book, especially the attendance. "The 
young woman with the flannel bandage waited^ 
and dropped everything on the table wherever it 
happened to go, and never moved it again until 
she put it on the stairs. Tne person I had seen 
in pattens (who I suppose to have been the cook) 
frequently came and skirmished with her at the 
door, and there appeared to be ill-will between 
them." The dinner given by Mr. Guppy at 
the " Slap Bang " dining house is another feature 
of this book — veal and ham, and French beans, 
summer cabbage, pots of half-and-half, marrow 
puddings, "three Cheshires " and "three small 
rums." Of the items in this list, the marrow 
pudding seems to be as extinct — in London, at all 
events — as the dodo. It appears to be a mixture 
of bread, pounded almonds, cream, eggs, lemon 
peel, sugar, nutmeg, and marrow j and sounds

. David Copperfield's dinner in his Buck- 
rngham Street chambers was an event vi^ith a 
disastrous termination. "It was a remarkable 
want of forethought on the part of the ironmonger 
who had made Mrs. Crupp's kitchen fireplace, 
that it was capable of cooking nothing but chops 
and mashed potatoes. As to a fish-kettle, Mrs. 
Crupp said ' Well ! would I only come and look 
at the range ? She couldn't say fairer than that. 
Would I come and look at it ? ' As I should not 
have been much the wiser if I had looked at it 
I said never rnind fish. But Mrs. Crupp said, 
' Don't say that j oysters was in, and why not 
them ? ' So that was settled. Mrs. Crupp then 
said ' What she would recommend would be this. 
A pair of hot roast fowls — from the pastry cook's ; 
a dish of stewed beef, with vegetables — from the 
pastry cook's j two little corner things, as a raised 
pie and a dish of kidneys — from the pastry cook's ; 
a tart, and (if I liked) a shape of jelly — from the 
pastry cook's. This,' Mrs. Crupp said, 'would 
leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind 
on the potatoes, and to serve up the cheese and 
celery as she could wish to see it done.' " 

Then blessings on thee, Micawber, most 
charming of characters in fiction, mightiest of 
punch-brewers ! The only feult I have to find 
with the novel of David Copperfield is that we 
don't get enough of Micawber. The same 
fault, however, could hardly be said to lie in the 
play; for if ever there was a "fat" part, it is 
Wilkins Micawber, 

Martin Chuzziewit bubbles over with eating 
and drinking ; and " Todgers " has become as

proverbial as Hamlet. In Nicholas Nickleby^ too, 
we find plenty of mention of solids and liquids ; 
and as a poor stroller myself at one time, it 
has always struck me that " business " could not 
have been so very bad, after all, in the Crummies 
Combination j for the manager, at all events, 
seems to have fared particularly well. Last on 
the list comes The Old Curiosity Shop^ with the 
celebrated stew at the "Jolly Sandboys," the 
ingredients in which have already been quoted by 
the present writer. With regard to this stew 
all that I have to remark is that I should have 
substituted an ox-kidney for the tripe, and left 
out the " sparrowgrass," the flavour of which 
would be quite lost in the crowd of ingredients. 
But there ! who can cavil at such a feast ? 
"Fetch me a pint of warm ale, and don't let 
nobody bring into the room even so much as a 
biscuit till the time arrives." 

Codlin may not have been "the friend" j but he 
was certainly the judge of the " Punch " party. 

In this realistic age, meals on the stage have to 
be provided from high-class hotels or restaurants ; 
and this is, probably, the chief reason why there 
is so little eating and drinking introduced into 
the modern drama. Gone are the nights of 
the banquet of pasteboard poultry, " property " 
pine-apples, and gilded flagons containing nothing 
more sustaining than the atmosphere of coal-gas. 
Not much faith is placed in the comic scenes of 
a pantomime nowadays ; or it is probable that 
the clown would purloin real York hams, and 
stuff Wall's sausages into the pockets of his 
ample pants. Champagne is champagne under 



258 CAKES AND ALE 

the present regime of raised prices, raised salaries, 
raised everything ; and it is not so long since 1 
overheard an actor-manager chide a vi^aiter from 
a fashionable restaurant, for forgetting the 
Soubise sauce, when he brought the cutlets. 

In my acting days we usually had canvas 
fowls, stuffed with sawdust, when we revelled 
on the stage ; or, if business had been particularly 
good, the poultry was made from breakfast rolls, 
with pieces skewered on, to represent the limbs. 
And the potables — Gadzooks ! What horrible 
concoctions have found their way down this 
unsuspecting throttle ! Sherry was invariably re- 
presented by cold tea, which is palatable enough 
if home-made, under careful superintendence, 
but, drawn in the property-master's den, usually 
tasted of glue. Ginger beer, at three-farthings 
for two bottles, poured into tumblers containing 
portions of a seidlitz-powder, always did duty 
for champagne ; and as for port or claret — well, 
I quite thought I had swallowed the deadliest of 
poisons one night, until assured it was only the 
cold leavings of the stage-door-keeper's coffee ! 

The story of Tiny Tim who ate the goose 
is a pretty famiHar one in stage circles. When 
playing Bob Cratchit, in The Christmas Carol at 
the Adelphi, under Mr. Benjamin Webster's 
management, Mr. J. L. Toole had to carve a real 
goose and a " practicable " plum-pudding during 
the run of that piece, forty nights. And the 
little girl who played Tiny Tim used to finish 
her portions of goose and pudding with such 
amazing celerity that Mr. Toole became quite 
alarmed on her account.

"'I don*t like it,' I said," writes dear friend 
"Johnny," in his Reminiscences; "'I can't 
conceive where a poor, delicate little thing like 
that puts the food. Besides, although I like the 
children to enjoy a treat' — and how they kept 
on enjoying it for forty nights was a mystery, 
for I got into such a condition that if I dined 
at a friend's house, and goose was on the table, 
I regarded it as a personal affront — I said, re- 
ferring to Tiny Tim, ' I don't like greediness ; 
and it is additionally repulsive in a refined- 
looking, deHcate Httle thing like this ; besides, 
it destroys the sentiment of the situation — and 
when I, as Bob, ought to feel most pathetic, I 
am always wondering where the goose and the 
pudding are, or whether anything serious in the 
way of a fit will happen to Tiny Tim before 
the audience, in consequence of her unnatural 
gorging ! ' Mrs. Mellon laughed at me at first, 
but eventually we decided to watch Tiny Tim 
together. 

"We watched as well as we could, and the 
moment Tiny Tim was seated, and began to 
eat, we observed a curious shuffling movement 
at the stage-fireplace, and everything that I had 
given her, goose and potatoes, and apple-sauce 
disappeared behind the sham stove, the child 
pretending to eat as heartily as ever from the 
empty plate. When the performance was over, 
Mrs. Mellon and myself asked the little girl 
what became of the food she did not eat, and, 
after a little hesitation, she confessed that her 
little sister (I should mention that they were 
the children of one of the scene-shifters) waited 



26o CAKES AND ALE 

on the other side of the fireplace for the supplies, 
and then the whole family enjoyed a hearty 
supper every night. 

" Dickens was very much interested in the 
incident. When I had finished, he smiled a 
little sadly, I thought, and then, shaking me by 
the hand, he said, ' Ah ! you ought to have given 
her the whole goose.' " 



CHAPTER XXII 



RESTORATIVES 

" Raze out the written troubles of the brain, 
And with some antibilious antidote 
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff 
Which weighs upon the soul." 

William of Normandy — A " head " wind at sea — Beware the 
druggist — Pick-me-ups of all sorts and conditions — Anchovy 
toast for the invalid — A small bottle — Straight talks to 
fanatics — Total abstinence as bad as the other thing — 
Moderation in all things — wisely and slow — Carpe diem — 
But have a thought for the morrow. 

"I CARE not," observed William of Normandy 
to his quartermaster- general, on the morning 
after the revelry which followed the Battle of 
Hastings, " who makes these barbarians' wines ; 
send me the man who can remove the beehive 
from my overwrought brain." 

This remark is not to be found in Macaulay's 
History of England ; but learned authorities who 
have read the original MS. in Early Norman, 
make no doubt as to the correct translation. 

" It is excellent," as the poet says, " to have 
a giant's thirst ; but it is tyrannous to use it 



262 CAKES AND ALE 

like a giant." And not only " tyrannous " but 
short-sighted. For the law of compensation is 
one of the first edicts of Nature. The same 
beneficent hand which provides the simple fruits 
of the earth for the delectation of man, furnishes 
also the slug and the wasp, to see that he doesn't 
get too much. Our friend the dog is deprived 
of the power of articulation, but he has a tail 
which can be wagged at the speed of 600 revolu- 
tions to the minute. And the man who overtaxes 
the powers of his inner mechanism during the 
hours of darkness is certain to feel the effects, to 
be smitten of conscience, and troubled of brain, 
when he awakes, a few hours later on. As this 
is not a medical treatise it would be out of place 
to analyse at length the abominable habit which 
the human brain and stomach have acquired, of 
acting and reacting on each other ; suffice it to 
say that there is no surer sign of the weakness 
and helplessness of poor, frail, sinful, fallen 
humanity than the obstinacy with which so 
many of us will, for the sake of an hour or two's 
revelry, boldly bid for five times the amount of 
misery and remorse. And this more especially 
applies to a life on the ocean wave. The 
midshipmite who over-estimates his swallowing 
capacity is no longer " mast - headed " next 
morning ; but the writer has experienced a 
cyclone in the Bay of Bengal, ere the effects of 
a birthday party on the previous night had been 
surmounted ; and the effects of " mast-heading " 
could hardly have been less desirable. In that 
most delightful work for the young, Dana's Two 
years before the Masty we read : 



KE3TORATIVES t6'i 

" Our forecastle, as usual after a liberty-day, was 
a scene of tumult all night long, from the drunken 
ones. They had just got to sleep toward morn- 
ing, when they were turned up with the rest, 
and kept at work all day in the water, carrying 
hides, their heads aching so that they could 
hardly stand. This is sailors' pleasure." 

Dana himself was ordered up aloft, to reef 
" torpsles," on his first morning at sea ; and he 
had probably had some sort of a farewell carouse, 
'ere quitting Boston. And the present writer 
upon one occasion — such is the irony of fate — 
was told off to indite a leading article on " Tem- 
perance " for an evening journal, within a very few 
hours of the termination of a " Derby " banquet. 

But how shall we alleviate the pangs ? How 
make that dreadful " day after " endurable enough 
to cause us to ofFer up thanks for being still allowed 
to live ? Come, the panacea, good doctor ! 

First of all, then, avoid the chemist and his 
works. I mean no disrespect to my good friend 
Sainsbury, or his "Number One rick-me-up," 
whose corpse-reviving claims are indisputable ; 
but at the same time the habitual swallower of 
drugs does not lead the happiest life. I once 
knew a young subaltern who had an account 
presented to him by the cashier of the firm of 
Peake and Allen, of the great continent of India, 
for nearly 300 rupees ; and the items in said account 
were entirely chloric ether, extract of cardamoms 
— with the other component parts of a high-class 
restorative, and interest. Saddening ! The next 
thing to avoid, the first thing in the morning, 
is soda-water, whether diluted with brandy or 



z64 CAKES AND ALE 

whisky. The " peg " may be all very well as 
an occasional potation, but, believe one who has 
tried most compounds, 'tis a precious poor 
" livener." On the contrary, although a beaker 
of the straw-coloured (or occasionally, mahogany- 
coloured) fluid may seem to steady the nerves for 
the time being, that effect is by no means lasting. 
But the same panacea will not do in every 
case. If the patient be sufficiently convalescent 
to digest a 

Doctor 

(I do not mean a M.R.C.S.) his state must be far 
from hopeless. A "Doctor" is a mixture of 
beaten raw egg — not forgetting the white, which 
is of even more value than the yolk to the 
invalid — brandy, a little sifted sugar, and new 
milk. But many devotees of Bacchus could as 
soon swallow rum-and-oysters, in bed. And do 
not let us blame Bacchus unduly for the matutinal 
trouble. The fairy Ala has probably had a 
lot to do with that trouble. A "Doctor" can 
be made with sherry or whisky, instead of brandy ; 
and many stockbrokers' clerks, sporting journal- 
ists, and other millionaires prefer a 

Surgeon-Major^ 

who appears in the form of a large tumbler con- 
taining a couple of eggs beaten, and filled to the 
brim with the wine of the champagne district. 

A Scorcher 

is made with the juice of half a lemon squeezed 
into a large wine-glass ; add a liqueur-glassful of 



RESTORATIVES 265 

old brandy, or Hollands, and a dust of cayenne. 
Mix well, and do not allow any lemon-pips to 
remain in the glass. 

Prairie Oyster, 

This is an American importation. There is 
a legend to the effect that one of a hunting party 
fell sick unto death, on the boundless prairie of 
Texas, and clamoured for oysters. Now the 
close and cautious bivalve no more thrives in a 
blue grass country than he possesses the ability 
to walk up stairs, or make a starting-price book. 
So one of the party, an inventive genius, cudgelled 
his brains for a substitute. He found some 
prairie hen's eggs, and administered the unbroken 
yolks thereof, one at a time, in a wine-glass con- 
taining a tea-spoonful of vinegar. He shook the 
pepper-castor over the yolks and added a pinch 
of salt. The patient recovered. The march of 
science has improved on this recipe. Instead of 
despoiling the prarie hen, the epicure now looks 
to Madame Gobble for a turkey tgg. And a 

Worcester Oyster 

is turned out ready made, by simply substituting 
a tea-spoonful of Lea and Perrins' most excellent 
sauce for vinegar. 

Brazil Relish. 

This is, I am assured, a much-admired restorative 
in Brazil, and the regions bordering on the River 
Plate. It does not sound exactly the sort of 
stimulant to take after a "bump supper," or a 
" Kaffir " entertainment, but here it is : Into a 



266 CAKES AND ALE 

wine-glass half full of cura^oa pop the unbroken 
yolk of a bantam's egg. Fill the glass up with 
maraschino. According to my notion, a good 
cup of hot, strong tea would be equally effectual, 
as an emetic, and withal cheaper. But they 
certainly take the mixture as a pick-me-up in 
Brazil. 

Port-flip 

is a favourite stimulant with our American 
cousins. Beat up an egg in a tumbler — if you 
have no metal vessels to shake it in, the shortest 
way is to put a clean white card, or a saucer, over 
the mouth of the tumbler, and shake — then add 
a little sugar, a glass of port, and some pounded 
ice. Strain before drinking. Leaving out the 
ice and the straining, this is exactly the same 
" refresher " which the friends of a criminal, who 
had served his term of incarceration in one of 
H.M. gaols, were in the habit of providing for 
him ; and when the Cold Bath Fields Prison was 
a going concern, there was a small hostelry hard 
by, in which, on a Monday morning, the con- 
sumption of port wine (fruity) and eggs ("shop 
'uns," every one) was considerable. This on the 
word of an ex-warder, who subsequently became 
a stage-door keeper. 

One of the most unsatisfactory effects of good 
living is that the demon invoked over-night does 
not always assume the same shape in your 
waking hours. Many sufferers will feel a loath- 
ing for any sort of food or drink, except cold 
water. "The capting," observed the soldier- 
servant to a visitor (this is an old story), "ain't 



RESTORATIVES 267 

very well this morning, sir ; he've just drunk his 
bath, and gone to bed again." And on the other 
hand, I have known the over-indulger absolutely 
ravenous for his breakfast. "Brandy and soda, 
no, dear old chappie ; as many eggs as they can 
poach in five minutes, a thick rasher of York 
ham, two muffins, and about a gallon and a half 
of hot coffee — that's what I feel like." Medical 
men will be able to explain those symptoms in the 
roysterer, who had probably eaten and drunk 
quite as much over-night as the " capting." For 
the roysterer with a shy appetite there are few 
things more valuable than an 

Anchvuy Toast, 

The concoction of this belongs to bedroom 
cookery, unless the sitting-room adjoins the sleep- 
ing apartment. For the patient will probably be 
too faint of heart to wish to meet his fellow-men 
and women downstairs, so early. The mixture 
must be made over hot water. Nearly fill a slop- 
basin with the boiling element, and place a soup- 
plate over it. In the plate melt a pat of butter 
the size of a walnut. Then having beaten up a 
raw egg, stir it in. When thoroughly incorpor- 
ated with the butter add a dessert-spoonful of 
essence of anchovies. Cayenne ad lib. Then 
let delicately-browned crisp toast be brought, hot 
from the fire. Soak this in the mixture, and 
eat as quickly as you can. The above propor- 
tions must be increased if more than one patient 
clamours for anchovy toast ; and this recipe is of 
no use for a dinner, or luncheon toast ; remember 
that. After the meal is finished turn in between 



268 CAKES AND ALE 

the sheets again for an hour ; then order a 
" Doctor," or a " Surgeon-Major " to be brought 
to the bedside. In another twenty minutes the 
patient will be ready for his tub (with the chill 
off, if he be past thirty, and has any wisdom, or 
liver, left within him). After dressing, if he live 
in London and there be any trace of brain-rack 
remaining, let him take a brisk walk to his hair- 
dresser's, having his boots cleaned en route. This 
is most important, whether they be clean or dirty ; 
for the action of a pair of briskly-directed brushes 
over the feet will often remove the most distress- 
ing of headaches. Arrived at the perruquier's, let 
the patient direct him to rub eau de Cologne^ or 
some other perfumed spirit, into the o'er-taxed 
cranium, and to squirt assorted essences over the 
distorted countenance. A good hard brush, and 
a dab of bay rum on the temples will complete 
the cure ; the roysterer will then be ready to face 
his employer, or the maiden aunt from whom he 
may have expectations. 

If the flavour of the anchovy be disagreeable, 
let the patient try the following toast, which is 
similar to that used with wildfowl : Melt a pat 
of butter over hot water, stir in a dessert-spoonful 
of Worcester sauce, the same quantity of orange 
juice, a pinch of cayenne, and about half a wine- 
glassful of old port. Soak the toast in this mixture. 
The virtues of old port as a restorative cannot be 
too widely known. 

St. Mark's Pick-me-up. 

The following recipe was given to the writer 
by a member of an old Venetian family. 



RESTORATIVES 269 

Ten drops of angostura in a liqueur- glass, 
filled up with orange bitters. One wine-glassful 
of old brandy, one ditto cold water, one liqueur- 
glassful of cura^oa, and the juice of half a lemon. 
Mix well together. I have not yet tried this, 
which reads rather acid. 

For an 

Overtrained 

athlete, who may not take kindly to his rations, 
there is no better cure than the lean of an under- 
done chop {not blue inside) hot from the fire, on a 
hot plate, with a glass of port poured over. A 

Hot-pickle Sandwich 

should be made of two thin slices of crisp toast 
(no butter) with chopped West Indian pickles in 
between. And for a 

Devilled Biscuit 

select the plain cheese biscuit, heat in the oven, 
and then spread over it a paste composed of finely- 
pounded lobster worked up with butter, made 
mustard, ground ginger, cayenne, salt, chili 
vinegar, and (if liked) a little curry powder. 
Reheat the biscuit for a minute or two, and 
then deal with it. Both the last-named restora- 
tives will be found valuable ( ? ) liver tonics ; and 
to save future worry the patient had better 
calculate, at the same time, the amount of Estate 
Duty which will have to be paid out of his 
personalty, and secure a nice dry corner, out of 
the draught, for his place of sepulture. A 



270 CAKES AND ALE 

Working-Man's Livener^ 

(and by "working-man" the gentleman whose 
work consists principally in debating in taverns is 
intended) is usually a hair of the dog that bit 
him over- night ; and in some instances where 
doubt may exist as to the particular " tufter " of 
the pack which found the working-man out, 
the livener will be a miscellaneous one. For 
solid food, this brand of labourer will usually 
select an uncooked red -herring, which he will 
divide into swallow-portions with his clasp-knife, 
after borrowing the pepper-castor from the tavern 
counter. And as new rum mixed with four- 
penny ale occasionally enters into the over-night's 
programme of the horny - handed one, he is 
frequently very thirsty indeed before the hour of 
noon. 

I have seen a journalist suck half a lemon, 
previously well besprinkled with cayenne, prior to 
commencing his matutinal "scratch." But rum 
and milk form, I believe, the favourite livener 
throughout the district which lies between the 
Adelphi Theatre and St. Paul's Cathedral. And, 
according to Doctor Edward Smith (the chief 
English authority on dietetics), rum and milk 
form the most powerful restorative known to 
science. With all due respect to Doctor Smith 
I am prepared to back another restorative, com- 
monly known as " a small bottle " ; which means 
a pint of champagne. I have prescribed this 
many a time, and seldom known it fail. In case 
of partial failure repeat the dose. A valuable if 
seldom-employed restorative is made with 



RESTORATIVES ^^x 

Bovril 

as one of the ingredients. Make half-a-pint of 
beef-tea in a tumbler with this extract. Put the 
tumbler in a refrigerator for an hour, then add a 
liqueur-glassful of old brandy, with just a dust of 
cayenne. This is one of the very best pick-me- 
ups known to the faculty. A 

Swizzle^ 

for recuperative purposes is made with the follow- 
ing ingredients : — a wine-glassful of Hollands, a 
liqueur-glassful of cura^oa, three drops of angos- 
tura bitters, a little sugar, and half a small bottle 
of seltzer-water. Churn up the mixture with a 
swizzle-stick, which can be easily made with the 
assistance of a short length of cane (the ordinary 
school-treat brand) a piece of cork, a bit of string, 
and a pocket knife. 

A very extraordinary pick-me-up is mentioned 
by Mr. F. C. Philips, in one of his novels, and 
consists of equal parts of brandy and chili vinegar 
in a large wine-glass. Such a mixture would, in 
all probability, corrode sheet-iron. I am afraid 
that writers of romance occasionally borrow a 
little from imagination. 

The most effectual restorative for the total 
abstainer is unquestionably, old brandy. It 
should be remembered that a rich, heavy dinner 
is not bound to digest within the human frame, 
if washed down with tea, or aerated beverages. 
In fact, from the personal appearances of many 
worthy teetotallers I have known digestion can- 
not be their strong suit. Then many abstainers 



272 CAKES AND ALE 

only abstain in public, for the sake of example. 
And within the locked cupboard of the study 
lurks a certain black bottle, which does not 
contain Kopps's ale. Therefore I repeat that 
the most effectual restorative for the total abstainer 
— whether as a direct change, or as a hair of the 
dog — is brandy. 

Our ancestors cooled their coppers with small 
ale, and enjoyed a subsequent sluice at the pump in 
the yard ; these methods are still pursued by stable- 
helpers and such like. A good walk acts benefi- 
cially sometimes. Eat or drink nothing at all, 
but try and do five miles along the turnpike road 
within the hour. Many habitual roysterers hunt 
the next morning, with heads opening and shut- 
ting alternately, until the fox breaks covert, when 
misery of all sorts at once takes to itself wings. 
And I have heard a gallant warrior, whilst engaged 
in a Polo match on York Knavesmire, protest that 
he could distinctly see two Polo balls. But he 
was not in such bad case as the eminent jockey 
who declined to ride a horse in a hood and 
blinkers, because "one of us must see, and I'm 
hanged if / can ! " It was the same jockey who, 
upon being remonstrated with for taking up his 
whip at the final bend, when his horse was 
winning easily, replied : " whip be bio wed ! it 
was my balance pole : I should have fell ofF with- 
out it I " 

Straight Talks. 

In the lowest depth there is a lower depth,

For such I labour not. The seer of visions, the 
would-be strangler of serpents, the baffled rat- 
hunter, and other victims to the over-estimation 
of human capacity will get no assistance, beyond 
infinite pity, from the mind which guides this 
pen. The dog will return to his own vomit ; the 
wilful abuser of the goods sent by a bountiful 
Providence is past praying for. But to others 
who are on the point of crossing the Rubicon of 
good discretion I would urge that there will 
assuredly come a time when the pick-me-up 
will lose its virtue, and will fail to chase the 
sorrow from the brow, to minister to the dis- 
eased mind. Throughout this book I have 
endeavoured to preach the doctrine of moderation 
in enjoyment. Meat and drink are, like fire, 
very good servants, but the most oppressive and 
exacting of slave-drivers. Therefore enjoy the 
sweets of life, whilst ye can ; but as civilised 
beings, as gentlemen, and not as swine. For 
here is a motto which applies to eating and 
drinking even more than to other privileges 
which we enjoy : 

" Wisely, and slow ; 
They stumble who run fast ! " 

A resort to extremes is always to be deprecated, 
and many sensible men hold the total abstainer 
in contempt, unless he abstain simply and solely 
because a moderate use of " beer znd baccy " 
makes him ill ; and this man is indeed a rarity. 
The teetotaller is either a creature with no will- 
power in his composition, a Pharisee, who thanks 
Providence that he is not as other men, or a 



274 CAKES AND ALE 

lunatic. There can be no special virtue in 
"swearing ofF" good food and good liquor; 
whether for the sake of example, or for the sake 
of ascending a special pinnacle and posing to 
the world as the incarnation of perfection and 
hoHness. In the parable, the Publican was 
"justified" rather than the Pharisee, because the 
former had the more common sense, and knew 
that if he set up as immaculate and without 

uile he was deceiving himself and nobody else. 

ut here on earth, in the nineteenth century, 
the Publican stands a very poor chance with the 
Pharisee, whether the last-named assume the 
garb of " Social Purity," or " Vigilance," or the 
sombre raiment of the policeman. This is not 
right. This is altogether wrong. The total 
abstainer, the rabid jackass who denies himself — 
or claims that he does so — the juice of the grape, 
and drinks the horrible, flatulent, concoctions 
known as "temperance beverages," is just as 
great a sinner against common sense as that 
rabid jackass the habitual glutton, or drunkard, 
who, in abusing the good things of life — the 
gifts which are given us to enjoy — is putting 
together a rod of rattlesnakes for his own back. 

There is nothing picturesque about drunken- 
ness ; and there is still less of manliness therein. 
There is plenty of excuse for the careless, happy- 
go-lucky, casual over-estimater, who revels, on 
festive occasions, with his boon companions. 
'Tis a poor heart that never rejoices ; and 
wedding-feasts, celebrations of famous victories, 
birthday parties, and Christmas festivities have

low, from the earliest times. But there is no 
excuse, but only pity and disgust, for the sot 
who sits and soaks — or, worse still, stands and 
soaks — in the tavern day after day, and carries 
the brandy-bottle to bed with him. I have lived 
through two-thirds of the years allotted to man, 
and have never yet met the man who has done 
himself, or anybody else, any good by eating or 
drinking to excess. Nor is the man who has 
benefited himself, or society, through scorning 
and viHfying good cheer, a familiar sight in our 
midst. "Keep in the middle of the road," is 
the rule to be observed ; and there is no earthly 
reason why the man who may have applied "hot 
and rebellious liquors " to his blood, as a youth, 
should not enjoy that " lusty winter " of old age, 
"frosty but kindly," provided those warm and 
warhke liquors have been applied in moderation. 
I will conclude this sermon with part of a 
verse of the poet Dryden's imitation of the 
twenty-ninth Ode of Horace, though its heathen 
carpe diem sentiments should be qualified by a 
special caution as to the possible ill effects of 
bidding too fierce a defiance to the " reaction 
day." 

** Happy the man, and happy he alone, 
He who can call to-day his own ; 
He who, secure within, can say ; — 
To-morrow, do thy worst, I've liv'd to-day ! "

A GREAT LITERARY DISCOVERY 



JULIETTE DROUET'S LOVE-LETTERS TO 
VICTOR HUGO 

Edited with a Biography of Juliette Drouet by Louis 

Guimbaud ; translated by Lady Theodora Davidson. 

Demy 8vo , cloth gilt, with many illustrations, 10/6 

net. 
What is described as the most fascinating and notable human 
document seen for many years has recently been discovered in Paris 
by a distinguished French author, whose work has received the crown 
of the Academy. This writer, after ten years' patient work, has 
brought to light a collection of letters written by Juliette Drouet to 
Victor Hugo. 

The story of Juliette's love for the great French novelist is one of the 
most romantic in history. Becoming devotedly attached to him when 
he first noticed her playing a humble part in " Lucrezia Borgia," she 
followed him in his exile to Brussels, Guernsey and Jersey, where she 
inspired some of his greatest poems. To console herself whenever he 
was absent, she wrote down " everything that came into her head, 
everything that caused her heart to beat." These are not ordinary 
love-letters, but " scribbles," as Juliette herself called them, thrown 
upon paper hour after hour, cast into a corner without being read over, 
and secured by the lover at each of his visits, as so many trophies of 
passion. 

These letters were written so constantly that they number in all as 
many as 15,000, and of these a careful selection has been made for 
publication. M. Louis Guimbaud, who is responsible for the discovery 
of the letters, has added an extremely interesting biographical study of 
Juliette and her relations with Victor Hugo. The book, which is 
illustrated by a remarkable series of illustrations from the Victor 
Hugo Museum, contains many of the most tender and passionate 
love-letters ever written. 



LIFE AND LETTERS IN THE ITALIAN RENAIS- 
SANCE 

By Christopher Hare, author of ' ' Men and Women of 
the Italian Reformation," etc. 

Demy 8vo, cloth gilt, illustrated, 12/6 net. 
In this author's previous books on the Renaissance, he has told the 
story of Illustrious Ladies, of Emperors and Kings, Popes and Warriors, 
as makers of history in Italy and other lands. The present work is 
concerned with a finer and more enthralling subject : the lives of writers 
and thinkers as contrasted with the mere pomp and splendour of the 
time. The Poet, the Humanist, the Historian, the Diplomatist, and 
the Letter- writer, from Lorenzo the Magnificent to ^lachiavelli and 
Baldassare Castiglione, are treated in turn, in a bright, illuminating 
narrative. 

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF QUEEN ADELAIDE 

By Mary F. Sandars, Author of ' ' Princess and Queen 

of England," etc. 
Demy Svo, cloth gilt, with many rare illustrations, 16/- net. 
The wife of William IV. came as a foreigner to be Queen of England, 
and found herself surrounded by difficult and trying circumstances, 
both political and domestic. In dread of an impending revolution 
she exerted all her influence on the side of peace, and by this and the 
purity of her life and aims she earned the title of " Good Queen 
Adelaide." 

THE MARTYR OF LOVE : The Life of Louise de 

LA VaLLIERE 

By Claude Ferval, with an introduction by Jean 

Richepin ; translated by Sidney Dark. 
Demy 8vo, cloth gilt, illustrated, 16/- net. 
No more poignant account of the romance of Louise de la Valliere 
has ever been written than this by Claude Ferval, the well-known 
French romantic writer. In its always interesting setting of the gay, 
intriguing court at Fontainebleau, it tells in delightful, sympathetic 
language the story of the first mistress of Louis XIV. It is at once a 
vivid historical study and a passionate romance. 

IMPERIAL AMERICA 

By J. M. Kennedy, Author of " Tory Democracy," etc. 

Demy Svo, cloth gilt, illustrated, 12/6 net. 
Thoughtfully and lucidly, Mr. J. M. Kennedy, who is a well-known 
authority on international affairs, describes the " imperialistic " 
attitude of the United States in their relation to the European Powers 
and especially to Great Britain. The history of the States is traced 
in this light, the objects of the Monroe Doctrine are explained, and a 
description is given of the working of the U.S.A. home politics. The 
book is essentially up-to-date in its assignment of the place of the 
United States in European controversies. 



IRELAND : Vital Hour. 

<fediiq'By Arthur Lynch, M.P., Author of " Modern Authors : 

A Review and Forecast," "Approaches : The Poor 

Scholar's Quest of a Mecca," " Our Poets," "Human 

ij Documents," " Prince Azreel," " Psychology : "A 

^" New System," " Purpose and Evolution," " Sonnets 

of the Banner and the Star," etc., etc. 

In Demy Svo, cloth gilt, 10/6 net. 

Here, at length, is a fearless and illuminating book, written with 
inside knowledge of Irish politics. The author has had opportunity 
given to few of possessing essential knowledge of Irish organisations . 
He writes, however, less as an historian than as an engineer. He has 
entered upon the work in that rare spirit of patriotism which seeks the 
weaknesses and the strength of the materials of which the Irish nation 
of the future must be built. He tests the materials remorselessly, 
cutting down beneath surface-show till he finds sound substance. 

Animated as he is by hope for Ireland he discards flattery and 
flummery, and some of his criticisms of the existing state of affairs, 
particularly the influence of the clergy in politics, will produce a deep 
impression, and perhaps provoke fierce rejoinders. These remarks 
apply not to the priests only, but to their Orange confreres. His fer- 
vent desire is to see religious strife and bigotry eliminated from Irish 
public life. 

On the whole the book is both conciliatory and unifying, and the true 
way of Ireland's concord with England is pointed out. While daringly 
thrusting his hand into the furnace of burning questions of the day, the 
author has written in an easy, discursive style, lightening the pages by 
humourous touches, after the manner of his " Human Documents," or 
by graphic personal descriptions of famous men — such as Parnell, 
Davitt and Synge — whom he has encountered in his career. He prefers 
to illustrate a point by anecdote rather than belabour it by an argument. 

One of the chapters is in part Autobiograpical ; another chapter speaks 
of Parliament, with piquant notes of irony ; a fresh and lively dis- 
cussion of Irish Literature illustrates the author's characteristic style of 
uttering deep sayings in a light mood ; whilst another chapter, deal- 
ing with the Irish in America, will be read with peculiar interest at the 
present time. 

Altogether an original, bold, sincere, and, above all, upbuilding book. 

MARCHING SONGS. 

A pocket book for our soldiers. 

In cloth limp, 6d, net. 
" A merry heart goes all the day — your sad tires in a mile-a." Every 
soldier knows that without the rousing song each mile grows longer and 
longer. The object of this little handbook of melody is to help our 
weary warriors on their way. Songs which they sang as boys, and still 
sing as men, are here collected — songs with stirring tunes, swinging 
choruses, and all in correct time for marching. There is nothing to 
learn ; half the men in a Company would already know both the words 
and music of most, and the book is but a peg for the memory. To suit all, 
the tunes are given in the old, and in the tonic-sol-fa notation.

THE PRINCESS MATHILDE BONAPARTE 

By Philip W. Sergeant, Author of " The Last Empress 
of the French," etc. 

Demy Svo, cloth gilt, fully illustrated, 16/- net. 
Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, the niece of the great Emperor, died 
only ten years ago. She was the first serious passion of her cousin, the 
Emperor^Napoleon III, and she might have been, if she had wished, 
Empress of the French, Instead, she preferred to rule for half a 
century over a salon in Paris, where, although not without fault, she 
was known as " the good princess." 

JEJIOM JUNGLE TO ZOO 

"/ By Ellen Velvin, F.Z.S., Author of "Behind the 

Scenes with Wild Animals,'* etc. 

Large crown Svo, cloth gilt, with many remarkable 

photographs, 6/- net. 
A fascinatmg record of the many adventures to which wild animals 
and their keepers are subject from the time the animals are captured 
until their final lodgment in Zoo or menagerie. The author has studied 
wild animals for sixteen years, and writes from personal knowledge. 
The book is full of exciting stories and good descriptions of the methods 
of capture, transportation and caging of savage animals, together 
with accounts of their tricks, training, and escapes from captivity. 

THE ADMIRABLE PAINTER : A study of Leonardo 
da Vinci 
By A. J. Anderson, Author of *' The Romance of Era 
Filippo Lippi,*' " His Magnificence,*' etc. 
Demy Svo, cloth gilt, fully illustrated, 10/6 net. 
In this book we find Leonardo da Vinci to have been no absorbed, 
religious painter, but a man closely allied to every movement of the 
brilliant age in which he lived. Leonardo jotted down his thoughts in 
his notebooks and elaborated them with his brush, in the modelling 
of clay, or in the planning of canals, earthworks and flying-machines. 
These notebooks form the groundwork of Mr. Anderson's fascinating 
study, which gives us a better understanding of Leonardo, the man, as 
well as the painter, than was possible before. 

WOMEN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ERA 

By Lieut. -Col. Andrew C. P. Haggard, D.S.O., Author 

of " Remarkable Women of France, 1431—1749," etc. 

Demy Svo, cloth gilt, fully illustrated, 16/- net. 

Lleut.-Col. Haggard has many times proved that history can 

bie made as fascinating as fiction. Here he deals with the women 

whose more or less erratic careers influenced, by their love of display, 

the outbreak which culminated in the Reign of Terror. Most of them 

lived til) after the beginning of the Revolution, and some, like Marie 

Antoinette, Th6roigne de M^ricourt and Madame Roland, were sucked 

down in the maelstrom which their own actions had intensified.

"' No historian has ever succeeded in placing scenes and persons so 
vividly before the eyes of his readers as did tlie Duke de St. Simon. 
He was a born observer ; his curiosity was insatiable ; he had a keen 
insight into character ; he knew everybody, and has a hundred anec- 
dotes to relate of the men and women he describes. He had a singular 
knack of acquiring the confidential friendship of men in high office, 
from whom he learnt details of important state affairs. For a brief 
while he served as a soldier. Afterwards his life was passed at the 
Court of Louis XIV, where he won the affectionate intimacy of the 
Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Burgundy. St. Simon's famous 
Memoirs have recently been much neglected in England, owing to the 
mass of unnecessary detail overshadowing the marvellously fascinating 
chronicle beneath. In this edition, however, they have been carefully 
edited and should have an extraordinarily wide reception. 

BY THE WATERS OF GERMANY 

By Norma Lorimer, Author of " A Wife out of Egypt," 
etc. With a Preface by Douglas Sladen. 
.^, Demy 8vo, cloth gilt, with a coloured frontispiece and 

16 other illustrations by Margaret Thomas and Erna 
i^ Michel, 12/6 net. 

' This fascinating travel-book describes the land of the Rhine and the 
Black Forest, at the present time so much the centre of public interest. 
The natural and architectural beauties of Germany are too supreme 
for even the sternest German-hater to deny ; and this book describes 
them and the land around them well. But apart from the love-story 
which Miss Lorimer has weaved into the book, a particularly great 
interest attaches to her description of the home life of the men who, 
since she saw them, have deserved and received the condemnation of 
the whole civilized world. 

BY THE WATERS OF SICILY

New and Cheaper Edition, reset from new type, 
Large Crown Svo, cloth gilt, with a coloured frontis- 
piece and 16 other illustrations, 6/-. 
This book, the predecessor of " By the Waters of Germany," was 
called at the time of its original publication " one of the most original 
books of travel ever published." It had at once a big success, but for 
some time it has been quite out of print. Full of the vivid colour of 
Sicilian life, it is a delightfully picturesque volume, half travel-book, 
half story ; and there is a sparkle in it, for the author writes as if glad 
to be alive in her gorgeously beautiful surroundings.

THE NEW FRANCE, Being a History from the 

ACCESSION OF LOUIS PhILIPPE IN 1830 TO THE 

Revolution of 1848, with Appendices 
By Alexandre Dumas. Translated into English, with 

an introduction and notes by R. S. Garnett. 
In two volumes, Demy Svo, cloth gilt, profusely illus- 
trated with a rare portrait of Dumas and other pictures 
after famous artists. 24/- net. 

The map of Europe is about to be altered. Before long we shall be 
engaged in the marking out. This we can hardly follow with success 
unless we possess an intelligent knowledge of the history of our Allies. 
It is a curious fact that the present generation is always ignorant of 
the history of that which preceded it. Everyone or nearly everyone has 
read a history — Carlyle's or some other — of the French Revolution of 
1789 to 1800 ; very few seem versed in what followed and culminated 
in the revolution of 1848, which was the continuation of the first. 

Both revolutions resulted from an idea — the idea of the people. In 
1789 the people destroyed servitude, ignorance, privilege, monarchical 
despotism ; in 1848 they thrust aside representation by the few and a 
Monarchy which served its own interests to the prejudice of the country. 
It is impossible to understand the French Republic of to-day unless 
the struggle in 1848 be studied : for every profound revolution is 
an evolution. 

A man of genius, the author of the most essentially French book, 
both in its subject and treatment, that exists (its name is The Three 
Musketeers) took part in this second revolution, and having taken part 
in it, he wrote its history. Only instead of calling his book what it was 
— a history of France for eighteen years — that is to say from the 
accession of Louis Philippe in 1830 to his abdication in 1848 — he called 
it The Last King of the French. An unfortunate title, truly, for while 
the book was yet a new one the " last King" was succeeded by a man 
who, having been elected President, made himself Emperor. It will 
easily be understood that a book with such a title by a republican was 
not likely to be approved by the severe censorship of the Second 
Empire. And, in fact, no new edition of the book has appeared for 
sixty years, although its republican author was Alexandre Dumas. 

During the present war the Germans have twice marched over his 
grave at Villers Cotterets, near Soissons, where he sleeps with his brave 
father General Alexandre Dumas. The first march was en route for 
Paris ; the second was before the pursuit of our own and the French 
armies, and while these events were taking place the first translation of 
his long neglected book was being printed in London. Hahent sua fata 
tihelli. 

Written when the fame of its brilliant author was at its height, this 
book will be found eminently characteristic of him. Although a 
history composed with scrupulous fidelity to facts, it is as amusing as a 
romance. Wittily written, and abounding in life and colour, the long 
narrative takes the reader into the battlefield, the Court and the Hotel 
de Ville with equal success. Dumas, who in his early days occupied a 
desk in the prince's bureaux, but who resigned it when the Due 
d'Orleans became King of the French, relates much which it is curious 
to read at the present time. To his text, as originally published, are 
added as Appendices some papers from his pen relating to the history 
of the time, which are unknown in England.

Mr. John Calvin Brown, after many years of heavy commercial 
experience in England, in the United States, and on the Continent, 
reviews the most burning National reforms of the British Empire and 
of the United States. This narrative is made good reading even for 
the non-student of national and industrial affairs by the very large 
number of apposite stories interspersed among the plain arguments of 
the book, so that from cover to cover it reads like a most clearly in- 
structive, yet spicily humorous, after-dinner speech. 

SHORT CUTS TO FIRST AID

reap %vo (6J X ^), Id. net. 

At this particular time when thousands of active men have been 
suddenly uprooted from their normal life to serve as soldiers, special 
constables, and in other corps, the need is strongly felt for this book 
of Short Cuts to First Aid. It is not intended for students or experts, 
but for the man who wants to be ready to help those around him, and 
even, if necessary, to apply bandages to minor injuries on himself. 
England is training men to-day at double-quick time, and this book 
will give all the necessary information without redundant words or 
waste of time.

is the more difficult and more useful task of discovering the root causes

Extract from Editor''s preface, ** The want of a collection of short 

pieces for home use, which, while worthy of professional representation 

shall not be too exacting for amateur rendering, and shall be well 

within the limits of drawing-room resources, has often been pressed 

upon the Editor, and the difficulty of securing such pieces has alone 

delayed his issue of a collection. 

** Performances may be given in drawing-rooms, school rooms, and 
lecture halls, privately or for charitable purposes unconditionally, 
except that the authorship and source must be acknowledged on any 
printed programmes that may be issued, but permission must be

tributors reserves all dramatic rights for their performance in theatres 
and music halls or by professionals for professional purposes."

THE A.B.C. OF HERALDRY 

By Guy Cadogan Rothery, Author of " Symbols, 

Emblems and Devices," etc. ; With over 274 

illustrations in line and half-tone. 

This book traces the evolution of heraldry from its origin in ancient 

tribal totemism, through the feudal system, subordinating to some 

extent, the purely technical details to the romantic, sociological and 

artistic aspects. Nevertheless, to those who desire a handy reference 

book on the subject, giving information readily without dullness, it 

will be as useful as it will be to those who only seek a description of a 

subject wrapped in history and romance. 

THE A.B.C. OF THE ENGLISH CATHEDRALS 

By W. F. Taylor, Author of "The Charterhouse of 

London," etc. ; with over 120 photographs by the 

Author. 

This book, including both an historical section and a descriptive 

itinerary to each cathedral, deals with its subject broadly, yet with 

sufficient detail to make both an effective guide-book on the spot and a 

readable record for study. The numerous photographs by the author, 

while illustrating the essential points of the architecture, portray 

excellently the beauty of the old buildings. 

TJLE A.B.C. OF CHURCH ARCHITECTURE 

'^' By Sidney Heath, Author of "Our Homeland 
Churches," etc. ; with 60 pages of illustrations from 
photographs and drawings. 
While explaining clearly every feature of the different architectural 
styles, this book also shows in what way historical, religious and socio- 
logical events and ideas influenced the theories of building in the 
different centuries. To those interested in architecture, there is a 
constant fascination in the evolution of one style from another, and 
Mr. Heath has put many illuminating suggestions into his book. 

THE A.B.C. OF INDIAN ART 

By J. F. Blacker, Author of " The A.B.C. of Japanese 
Art," etc. ; richly illustrated. 
A complete survey of the art of India, forming a companion volume 
to " The A.B.C. of Japanese Art." Palaces, temples, and tombs 
represent the architecture ; armour, musical instruments, jewellery 
and metal work, show the craftsmanship ; paintings and carvings in 
wood and marble are carefully dealt with, while idols in stone, wood, 
and bronze speak of the inspiration of religion.

FANTOMAS 

By Pierre Souvestre and Marcel Allain. 

The authors of " Fantomas " have created a character that catches 
the imagination of the world. To find Fantomas, " the genius of 
crime," to know whether he is an individual or the directing spirit of 
a highly organised company, is the life-work of a detective, Juve, a 
character possessing as much actuality as Sherlock Holmes or Le Coq, 
or any of the famous figures in the fictional annals of crime. And 
when these two men are set against each other — Fantomas with 
his daring aud his cleverly planned and executed criminal 
operations, and Juve with his deductive reasoning and his 
dogged, silent, weasel-like pursuit of the man whom it is his fixed 
intention to run down — we have a story of imaginative ingenuity and 
strength that will rank with the best achievements of Gaboriau. 

SCHOOL FOR LOVERS 

By E. B. DE Rend ON ^•^^^'mT**. 

Love-making as an art is the theme of this novel in which the Latin 
spirit is revealed in its relation to the sexes. With scarcely an ex- 
ception, this particular expression of the Latin spirit in novels is only 
known to English readers through the medium of translations, but in 
a " School for Lovers " we have a novel written in English by a Latin 
on a vital human question — one as old as the first man and woman, 
and as perennially new as the dawn of To-Day. Seeing that the bonds 
of brotherhood between the Anglo-Saxon and the Latin races grow 
daily more close, is being more and more deeply realised in the storm 
and stress of the world struggle into which we have been plunged by 
an unscrupulous foe, the author is convinced that all Anglo-Saxons 
will feel more and more inclined to open their hearts to this Latin 
spirit as manifested in sex relations ; that at least they will perceive 
that, though sometimes too frank in expression, none the less is it 
essentially good-hearted, chivalrous and spiritual. Love Romantic 
is the Latin's watchword, not Love Sentimental. The latter form of 
love is, more often than not, tainted with hypocrisy, and is at bottom 
hard and self-seeking and brutal. In a " School for Lovers " the 
course of a Love Romantic is traced to its happy ending. 

THE WOMAN WHO LOOKED BACK 

By M. Hamilton, Author of " Cut Laurels," " Mrs. 
Brett," etc. 

This novel tells of a husband and wife who love each other deeply 
but quite undemonstratively until an unexpected discovery opens a 
way for deceit to come between. This is a story that will make a strong 
appeal to women, for it is written with deep insight into character 
and the power of emotion.

By Rafael Sabatini, Author of " The StrolHng Saint," 
" The Lion's Skin," etc. 
A romance of love. loyalty and intrigue in the days of George I. 
A mystery surrounds an agent of the exiled Stuarts, whose adventures 
are described with a dash that makes the book memorable among 
modern historical novels. The story moves swiftly, the rush and 
turmoil of events being interwoven with a love story as sweet and 
romantic as any that Mr. Sabatini has yet given us. 

THE FLUTE OF ARCADY 

By Kate Horn, Author of " Frivole," etc. 
A lightly written story of a young couple who conspire together to 
secure their own happiness by bringing romance into the lives of their 
unwilling guardians. The scene is laid chiefly in Paris and Versailles, 
where the heroine, Nina Menzies has been brought up in a convent. 
The secret of Miss Kate Horn's popularity is the brightness and humour 
of her clever character-drawing.

" The Passion of Kathleen Duveen," " Ruffles," etc.

MISS BILLY

The Glad Book," etc.

unknowingly upsets the quiet and dignity of a household of three 
bachelors, whose life had hitherto been strictly ordinary and unevent- 
ful. The story has many amusing situations and a refreshing romance 
which endears Billy, as well as her three crusty, but good-hearted 
friends, to the reader. There is an immense fascination about the 
brightness of the story. It is a book with a sparkle. 

RODING RECTORY 

By Archibald Marshall, Author of " Exton Manor," 
"The Honour of the Clintons," etc. 
** Roding Rectory," with its view of life in a small English country 
town, is undoubtedly Mr. Marshall's best novel, and will even bear 
comparison with the " Barchester " Series of Anthony Trollope. It 
presents a most dramatic situation in Dr. French's defence against the 
antagonism of the truculent Gosset and the scheming Miss Budd in 
bringing to light a fault of the Rector's youth and promoting a cam- 
paign of jealousy against him. 

THE DOUBLE HOUSE

" Clive Lorimer's Marriage," etc. 
An old, rambling manor-house in Somersetshire, is shared by Colonel 
Colquhoun, who has resigned his commission after being wrongly 
suspected of murder, and the beautiful Lois Enderby. The two soon 
become attached, but each is involved in a net of mystery, and not 
until these have been unravelled can they reach happiness together. 

A " WATER-FLY'S " WOOING : A Drama of Black 

and White Marriages 

By Annesley Kenealy, Author of " Thus Saith Mrs. 
Grundy," " The Poodle -Woman," etc. 

The novels of INIiss Annesley KeneaJy have always a good deal of 
thought behind them, and are founded on subjects of considerable 
moment. In " A ' Water-Fly's ' Wooing," she has written a vigorous 
tale of intense human interest. As the sub-title implies it deals with 
the ever-present race problem, and presents it in a way that will make 
a wide appeal. 

SWORD AND CROSS 

By Silas K. Hocking, Author of " Her Benny," etc. 
" Sword and Cross " is the story of a brilliant young minster who 
takes a firm stand upon a matter of public enthusiasm. His congregation 
falls away, his acquaintances publicly shun him, he is hooted in the 
streets, and his windows are stoned by the mob. The story is one of the 
most enthralling that this popular novelist has ever written.

THE UNDYING RACE . iIIT 

By Rene Milan. 

Ren6 Milan is a French torpedo-boat commander, at present 
serving in the Flying Corps of the French navy. Like his brother 
officer, " Pierre Loti," he wields the pen as well as the sword. His 
novel " The Undying Race," which has had a splendid success in 
France, is based on the survival of a family from very early Tartar 
days down to quite modern times. The story is unhesitatingly recom- 
mended as a book of wonderful interest and originality. 

LITTLE MADAME CLAUDE 

By Hamilton Drummond, Author of *' Shoes of Gold," 
:. "The Winds of God," etc. 

This story centres round the struggle between a man and a woman 
for possession of Little Madame Claude, the daughter of Louis XII. of

intrigue which, although waged in secret, goes keenly and bitterly to 
its end. 

PASSION AND FAITH 

By Dorothea Gerard, Author of " The City of 
Enticement," " The Waters of Lethe," etc. 
This vivid story depicts the conflict between passion and faith in 
the soul of Marion Escott, a generous but headstrong woman whose 
love for the man she should marry is challenged by the tribunal of her 
faith. The struggle wages with varying fortunes down to the issue, 
which is reached with this author's usual sympathy and strength. 

THE SAILS OF LIFE ^irr 0> 

By Cecil Adair, Author of " Gabriers Garden," etc. 

This novel tells the life-story of a young clergyman in an East End 
parish, who works on lines of his own and finds a lack of sympathy 
from those outside. A young cousin, Molly Rutland, comes to take a 
deep interest in his work, but he goes abroad and there meets the 
woman of his love. He finds, however, that she cannot share his life 
in East London, and so his love-problem is worked out. 

LADY VARLEY 

By Derek Vane, Author of ** The Secret Door," etc. 

f A character study of two men and two women brought together in 
a lonely country house by the mysterious death of another man in a 
London flat. Among them is hidden the secret of the mystery, and the 
reader is kept on the tip-toe of expectation as one after another is 
threatened with exposure. A good, animated story.

when Cesare Borgia exercised all the craft for which he was famous to 
wrest this rich state from its hereditary princes. The adventures of 
the Duke Grindobaldo in escaping with only two companions to safety, 
together with a romantic love-story, form the theme of a novel set 
in one of the most turbulent and brilliant periods of Italian history. 

A GENTLEWOMAN OF FRANCE 

By Rene Boylesve, Author of " A House on the Hill," 
etc. 
This story, although quite unlike the typical French novel, was 
crowned by the Academy and attained great popularity on the Con- 
tinent. It is the story of a young woman who makes a marriage of 
convenience and then, meeting the man whom she would have wished 
to make her husband, stands firm in all trials and temptations. In 
simple, direct fashion she tells her story, and it rings extraordinarily 
true. 

THE CREEPING TIDES 

By Kate Jordan. 

The scene of " The Creeping Tides " is laid in a quiet, old-built 
** backwater " in one of the busiest parts of a foreign city. An English 
soldier, concealing a shattered reputation, meets a young girl also 
harassed by dread of detection, and this strong and appealing novel 
tells how together they face the creeping tides of exposure and reach 
peace and safety. 

THE GREAT MIRACLE .j ,.. , 

By J. P. Vanewords. ^ ^. 

The hero of this novel becomes possessed of a spell, wliich confers 
on its holder immunity from death, pain or restraint. The effect of

described in a story of adventure which leads through prison, law-court, 
battleship, and palace to its denoument.

By Violet Hunt, Author of "The Doll," "The 
Celebrity's Daughter," etc. 
Alfred Pleydell, a charming and artistic person with very little 
capacity for earning money, marries against the wishes of his uncle, a 
millionaire collector of old furniture and antique mirrors, and finds 
himself disinherited. How Rosamund, his wife, by what amounts to 
effacing herself, succeeds in gaining for her husband his uncle's in- 
heritance and the House of Many Mirrors is the theme of Miss Violet 
Hunt's new story. 

THISTLES : A Study of the Artistic Temperament 
By CoRALiE Stanton and Heath Hosken, Authors of 
"The Swelling of Jordan," etc. 
A strong dramatic novel of modern life, in which mysterious Chinese 
conspirators lead the way through a maze of exciting incidents. The 
adventures of the hero, threatened, captured, and escaping, will be 
followed with zest by all lovers of a thrilling story. These popular 
collaborators are here at their best in a novel full of rapid action. 

ON DESERT ALTARS 

"" Norma Lorimer, Author of " A Wife out of Egypt," etc. 

Miss Lorimer, with characteristic courage and delicacy, has tackled 
another elemental problem. A woman finds that the only way to get 
the husband whom she adores out of the swamps of the Gold Coast, 
which are killing him with fever, and to find him work by her side in 
London, is to receive for a few weeks the visits of a great financier, who 
is passionately fond of her, but whom she detests. The husband comes 
home and recovers his health, but eventually discovers what his wife 
has done. 

Once more Miss Lorimer has given us a very human woman wrestling 
with her longing for a larger life. 

THE HOUR OF CONFLICT 
u By A. Hamilton Gibbs. 

The love-story of Everard, a young Oxonian, and a pretty French 
girl, Toinette, in a delightful little French watering-place. It is 
admirably written, it shows a real knowledge of life and human nature, 
and it contains several studies of character of unusual excellence. It 
is a clever piece of work, which may be described as " a story of passion, 
remorse, and atonement." 

A WIFE OUT OF EGYPT 

By Norma Lorimer, Author of " The Second Woman," 
" By The Waters of Germany," etc. 
A beautiful and gifted girl, half English, half-Syrian, after education 
in England returns to Egypt and finds that she — as a Syrian — has no 
social status. She is soon in conflict with her very English soldier 
lover, whose place is afterwards taken by a man less squeamish in 
matters merely social. 

A thoroughly good Egyptian romance.
