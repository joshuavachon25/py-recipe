OLD AND NEW COOK BOOK, 



BY 



MRS. MARTHA PRITCHARD STANFORD, 
OF NEW ORLEANS, LA. 



We may live without friends; we may live without books; 
But civilized man cannot live without cooks. 



He may live without love, what is passion but pining ? 
But where is the man that can live without dining fLucik.

THE AUTHOR'S NOTICE. 



In presenting THE OLD AND NEW COOK BOOK to 
my friends and to the public, I do so in full confidence in the 
knowledge that every one of the 576 recipes contained in the 
volume has been successfully used in my own kitchen. These 
recipes were selected from many hundreds gathered by my family 
through several generations. In preparing dishes from these 
recipes, directions as to proportions and materials used must be 
carefully followed, else the excellence of results will not be ob- 
tained. Nearly all of the recipes are intended to serve from six 

to eight persons.
