HINTS ON MAKING DOUGHNUTS. 

To have fried cakes good, the fat should be of the 
,i.d h^at. When it is hot enough it will -ase to bub 
tnd be perfectly still. At least two pounds ot a»' .^^Ul

hfa few sec^^^^^^^ to the top, and occasion a bubbbng in 
t^l e fat it will swell, and the underside .ju'ckly bcconie 
own It should then be turned over ; they should he 
me two or three times. In order to juoge wle 
c o led break open one. When done dram them we

Al>out a half an liour will be required to cook them after 
thoy begin to roast. The oven should be hot when the 
birds are put in. Send to the table hot on buttered toast. 

FRYING YOUNG CHICKENS. 

When frying young chiekens, cut up, season with pep- 
per, salt, and put in the stewpan with very little water, 
and boil until heated througli. It seasons them better, 
and prevents that raw look next to the bone. 

ROAST TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 

Clean, wash, and wipe dry, rub with salt inside. Fill 
with dressing made of bread crumbs soaked in cold water 
and squeezed out as dry as possible, and seasoned with 
butter, pepper, and salt to taste, and sage and thyme (or 
any dressing preferred), then sew up and truss. Put in 
the roasting pan with water and a piece of butter, or, 
better still,"a few slices of fat salt f>ork. Baste often until 
nearly done. Chop the giblets tine, and cook in a sauce- 
pan until tender. When the fowl is done, add them to 
the gravy, which thicken with wetted flour. Bake the 
fowl until tender, and of a rich brown. 

ROAST TURKEY WJTII POTATO SrUFFlNG. 

Choo.se a short, plump turkey with yellowish white 
skin, and a soft tip to the lower end of the breast bone. 
This show;i that the bird is co young that the cartilage 
has not yet hardened into bone. Remove all the small 
feathers, singe . ft' the hairs with lighted brown paper, or 
with a little alcohol burning on a plate. Wipe the binl 
carefully with a damp cloth, cut away the oil-sack from 
the upper part of the tail, scrape the skin from the legs

open and pull it forward until the crop and wind-pipe can 
be cut away without scattering their contents Ihen 
make a cut under one leg from its junction with the body 
down to and around the vent. By introducing the hand 
into this cut, the intestines can be loosened from the body 
of the bird and removed without tearing them apart or 
breaking them ; and if this is done the turkey does not 
need washing, and conseriuently does not lose its flavor 
bv soaking in water. Stuff the bird with halt a dozen 
larjie potatoes, peeled boiled, and mashed, with a season- 
ing of salt, pepper and ground thyme, savory, or marjo- 
ram ; a cup of highly seasoned sausage meat, or cold meat 
of any kind is a great addition to this stufling. When 
the turkey is stuffed and the cuts sewed up. it is to be 
trussed, or tied in shape, placed in a dripping pan, and 
browned quickly in a hot oven. When it is browned it 
can be seasoned, and occa-sionally basted with its own 
dripping, or a little butter; if a frothed surface is desired 
a little flour should be dredged over the turkey just be- 
fore bast'ng. An eight or nine pound turkey will roast 
in about two hours and a-half. A good gravy may be 
made by browning a tablespoonful of flour in some of 
the drippings, adding a pint of water and seasoning to 

^^^^''' BROILED BEEF STEAKS. 

Have d bright, clear fire, rub the gridiron over with a 
bit of beef suet, and lay on the steak. (It is a good 
plan to pound it before putting to cook, as it renders it 
more tender when cooked.) When it begins to broi turn 
the upper side down, and so continue to turn it back and 
forth till it is done. Have your dish ready with a good 
bit of butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Ser\'e very

delicious with a simple dressing of pepper, salt, and butter. 

A BREAKFAST DISH. 

Cut slices from the breast of a cold fowl, or cold veal, 
or any other white meat may be used. Dip in beaten

BOILED PIGS' FEET. 

Thoroughly clean, and soak in salted water a few days. 
Remove from tlic brine, and put on to scald in clear boil- 
ing water, let boil five or ten minutes, pour oti' the water, 
put on fresh and let boil Hve or ten minutes longer. Pour 
off the water again, and put on fresh, and let boil until 
thoroughly done. Have ready enough boiling hot vinegar 
to cover them, spiced with cloves, mace, and peppercorns. 
Put the pigs' feet in a jar, pour over them the sj)iccd vine 
gar. Let stand until cold, and they are ready to send to 
the table. 

TO BOIL A UAM. 

Soak the ham for twenty-four hours in cold water, 
i'ut on to boil in cold water. When it is done, draw off' 
ihe skin, and strew rasped bread over it. Boil four or five 
hours. 

broil?:d ham. 

Prepare the ham as for frying, but cut the slices thinly, 
removfe most of the fat; the fire must be clear or the ham 
will have a smoky flavor, far from agreeable. Serve 
jtoached eggs with broiled ham. 

HAM AND EGGS. 

Chop finely some cold boiled ham, fat and lean together. 
Allow a pound for four eggs. Put a piece of butter in 
the ])an, then the ham. Let it get well warmed through, 
then beat the eggs light and stir them in briskly. Dust 
in a little pepper. 

BAKED BEANS WITH PORK. 

Look over, wash, and put to soak over night, a quart 
of dry beans. In the morning put on to boil in two 
quarts of cold water, boil slowly half an hour ; then drain 



I

off the water, an«l put on the same quantity as before of 
hot water, boil half an lio'ir and pour off ajjain ; now put 
on enough hot water to a good deal more than cover the 
beans. i*ut half a pound of pork, which has l)een washed 
and the skin well scraped, into the kettle, and boil slowly 
until both are cooked, addin<,' water from time to time if 
necessary. Remove to a bakin^j pan, add pepper and 
s&lt if needed. Put the pork in the centre of the dish, 
with the skin side scored up, and bake in a hot oven 
until both beans and pork are of a golden brown. When 
cold, baked beans should cut smooth and «' "'d like cheese; 
if they crumble they have been baked too ilry. 

TO TRUSS A FOWL. 



Cut off the legs at first joint if for roasting, lor boiling 
cut off the claws, dip the legs in boiling water for a few 
minutes, when the skin can be easily scraped off'. Cut 
off the entire neck, having drawn back the skin an inch 
or two, so that when brought forward it will cover the 
end of the bone. Turn the pinions under, run a skewer 
through them and the middle of the legs, which should 
be pa.ssed through the body to the pinion and leg, on the 
other side, one skewer securing the limbs on both sides. 
Tie the legs together by passing trussing needle threa«led 
with twine through the back bone and securing it on the 
other side.

on Its back in a roastin/^r pan, in which sliould be a cupful 
of liot water and u piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Kej)lenish the water as it boils away, fo.- the flavor will 
be injured if allowed to .scorch. CoVer tlie breast of the 
duck with Hlice-s of fat salt jwrk, as thin as they can be 
cut, to season it while cooking, and in the cooking it will 
shrivel and abnost disa})pear if cut thin enough. Haste 
fnvjuontly with l)utter and water until nearly done. Tlie 
duck should be of a dark rich brown color and very 
tender when done. The giblets .should ],e cooked in a 
saucepan by themselves, then chopped fine ready to a(l<l 
to the gravy when the duck is done. Thi<ken the gravy 
with a little Hour and water.and .send to the table in a'sauce 
boat. About a teaeupful of hot water will be sutfieient 
to add to the pan, after the duck or ducks are removed 
to the platter. The rind should be cut from the pork 
used. Have a moderate oven. A duck will recpiire an 
hour and a-lialf or two hours to cook. A duck that 
requires parboiling should never be cooked. The wood 
duck, black duck, red hea<l, teal, and canvas back are the 
best. The blue-bill, broad-bill, widgeon, and ).ini.ail 
should be next in choice. These are the only kinds lit to 
use, although other varieties are often in tlie market.

the turkey and platter. Serve boiling hot. This sauce 
must be made while the turkey is still in the steamer, so 
that it can be poured over the turkey as .soon as it is taken 
up. 

CALF'S BRAINS STEWED. 

Take the brains of half a dozen calves' heads ; let them 
soak in cold water for about an hour. Render a little 
bacon in a saucepan with a few sliced carrots and onions 
mixed, some parsley, thyme, bay leaves, etc. When they 
have simmered a little while add half a bottle of claret 
wine, with a little salt and a whole pepper. As .soon as it 
commences to boil add the brains, let them boil about 
twenty minutes on a slow fire then take them out, bind 
the liquid with a little flour and butter mixed and al- 
ready cooked. Let it reduce until al)out half the (piantity 
is left, then strain through a sieve ; put it into a .saucepan 
with some bacon cut in small .sc^uares, about two dozen

M.ike a weak synip of one cup of su^jar to two cups of 
cold water. Allow this ([uantity for every quart jar. 
Boil the syrup briskly for about fifteen minutes, then 
skim, set on the back part of the stove whcni it will keep 
warm, but not cook while the fruit is being prepared. It 
is well to have an open frame made to tit the bottom of 
a clothes boiler in wliich to set the jars while boiling the 
fruit. Have the jais perfectly clean. Drop the fruit 
gently into the jars ; fill up to the brim. Strawberr'es 
should be hulled tirst. Cherries should Ik; left unstoned. 
Plums shoidd be pricked thoroughly to prevent their 
bursting. Pears should be cut in halve.i. Peaches ^hould 
be pared, cut in half and the stones removed. As soon as 
the jars are filled with the prepared fruit, the syrup 
should be poured over tl»em immediately. Put the jars 
in the wooden frame in the boiler. (If you cannot obtain 
the wooden frame, wrap a cloth around each jai-, or put 
plenty of cl»an straw between the jars to prevent them 
knocking together, while boiling). Fill the boiler with 
water about the temj)erature of the .syrup in the jars, and 
should reach the necks of the jars. Allow berries, 
cherries, plums, peaches, pears, grapes, and jtine-applcs, 
about twenty minutes to boil. Then remove each jar 
carefully from the boiling water, unscrew the top, fill up 
the space wliere the syrup has boiled down, with fresli 
boiling syrup from the stove, put on tlie rubbers and 
screw on the tops again as tightly as possible. When tlie

S(pieozin<^', and dioj) thiin into a :j^em jar of salt anil water, 
a handful of salt to the iiuart. Wlicn the pools of a 
dozen orani,fes and lemons have thus been colloet«;(l, re- 
move them fioni tlu- hrino, ])ut tliom on the fire in cold

they aro tender onouiili to run a straw throu'di them, re- 
move from the lire, and out into hits an inch loni^f, and a

slowly till the peels aro clear, then more rapidly till there 
is so little li(juid left that tney are in danger of buridng; 
draw the poL to the back of the stove, and allow the re- 
maining syrup to dry entirely away. At this stage 
sprinkle half a pound of sugar through them, spread 
them out on plates, put them in the oven with the door 
open, and let them remain all night to dry.

syruj) of the sugar and water, and boil until it is thick 
enough to " pull " as for candy. Remove to the back of 
the stove and stir until it shows signs of granulation. It 
is well to stir freciuently while it is cooking to secure this 
end. When there are grains or crystals on the spoon 
drop in thr cherries a few at a time. Let each supply 
lie in the boiling syrup two minutes, when remove to a 
sieve, and sot over a (lish. Shake gently and long; then

tablespoonfid each of cloves and allspice. Put on the tire 
and stew until the tomatoes and onions are c[uite tender

KOK^

It is a ffi'oat mistake to liavo lari,^.' ijnaiititios of fruit, 
liiscuit, etc., lying alioiit tho sick room. Friemls some- 
times with mistaken kindness l)iing in large l>asinf'uls of 
liuiriMe compounds, which they dignify with the namij 
of gruel, sago, or tapioca, as the case may ho. 'J'he mere 
siidit of food seemed to set the invalid airainst it. If a 
little care had heen hestowed upon its ])reparation, and 
a small (juantity ])rovi<led, instea<l of the large amount Ikj 
or she would i)iobal)ly have partaken ot" it with ])leasure. 
A few grapes, an orange ])eeled and divided, and two or 
three milk or watei" biscuits are ([uite enough to have dis- 
playetl at once. Provide dainty morsels of food, display 
them temptingly arranged, and take them to the bedside 
(pnte unex])ecte(ll\\ A gre.-it error is to keep asking the 
patients if tlu'V could eat this thing or the other. 'l"he 
an^wei- most likely would Ik;: " No, thaid<s, 1 don't fetd 
inclined to eat." A very (juick and simj)le way of cook- 
ing a bit of chicken oi' lish is to buttei- a ])aper thickly, 
place the food to be cooketl within the paper, and place 
it on the gridiron over a clear tire. 

now TO rREPAKE AN UNCOOKED EGG. 

This is a delicate, strengthening and valuable pre[)ai'a- 
tion for an invalid. Heat well the yolk and atea.spoonful 
of sugar in a goblet, then stir in one (»!• two teaspoonfuls 
of brandy, sherry, or port wine. Add to this naxture

desired flavor the egg with mitnieg. Some invalids do 
not like the yolk of egg. It may be left out if desired. 

BEEF TEA. 

Cut a piece of lean, juicy beef iuto j)ieees an inch 
S(iuare, put them into a wide-mouthed bottle, a "gem" 
'!ir is excellent for the purpose, and cork it tight. Set 
the l)ottle into a kettle of cold water and boil it an hour 
and a-half. This mode of making beef tea concentrates 
the nourishment more than any other. Another way is 
as follows: Choose a lean, juicy piece of beef, the size 
of your hand; take oil' all the fat ; broil it only three or 
four minutes on very hot coals, being very careful not to 
scorch or blacken it. Lay it in a porringer or bowl, 
sprinkle it with salt, ami pour upon it two or three gills 
of boiling water ; then cut it into suiall pieces as it lies in 
the water. Cover it close, and let it stand where it will 
keep hot, but not boil. It is lit for use in half an hour, 
and does well vvdiere such nourishment is wanted imme- 
diately. 

INVALID'S JELLV. 

(>velve shanks of mutton, three tpiarts of water, a 
iuiich of sweet herbs, pepper an<l salt to taste, three 
blades of mace, one onion, one pound ol" lean beef, a crust 
of bread toasted brown. Soak the shanks in plenty of 
water for some hours, and scrul> them well. Put them 
with the l>eef and other ingretlients into a .saucepan with 
the water, and let them simmer very gently for live hours. 
Strain the broth, and when cold take off all the fat. It 
may be eaten either warmed up or colil a,s a jelly.

Scra])e very fine two or three tablespoonfuls of fresh, 
juicy, tender raw beef ; season it sliglitly with salt and 
j)ei>per ; spread it between two slices of slightly buttered^ 
bread ; cut it neatly into diamonds about two and a-half 
inches long and an inch wide. 

OATMEAL GRUEL FOR INVALIDS. 

Two cups of Irish or Scotch oatmeal, two quarts of 
water, one teaspoon salt. Let oatmeal soak over night in 
half tlie water; strain. Add the rest of the water with 
the salt, and boil until it thickens. Let it cool to a jelly. 
Eat with jtowdered sugar and cream. A ilelicate way to 
vary an invalid's daily toast, is to heat a little clear, sweet 
cream, and <lip the toast into it. 

SOLIDIFIED BEEF TEA. 

One way to beguile an invalid into taking more beef 
tea than lie is willing for, is to add gelatine to it, and let 
it cool into a moidd. When it is hard and like jelly 
serve it with salt, and with wafers. 

MUTTON BROTH (QUICKLY MADE.
