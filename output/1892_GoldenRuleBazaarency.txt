PREFACE. 



Perhaps one caa say that the subject of Cookery has never 
ceived so much and so intelligent attention as at the present 
me. Not that more people have deliberately concluded that 
■lie wisdom of the ages is to "live to eat," but a great many 
•jareful observers and close thinkers are convinced that thp 
height of human wisdom is to "eat to live." Famous Cooks 
receive higher salaries than learned College Professors. The 
convictions of the older philosophers, and the rythm of earth's 
sweetest poet's are alike forgotten when placed side by side 
with the attractions of a fragrant roast, or an appetizing joint. 
A new and unproved recipe, tested and approved by a noted 
cook, recieves more attention than the discovery of an asteroid, 
or a theory of creation. And there is reason for the choice. 
The perfection of brain and body are equally dependend on the 
perfection of the food consumed, and its method of prepara- 
tion. The vast number of dyspeptics who make a tra' esty of 
life t=nd living are proof -^ositive that thers is still room foi 
improvement in cooking. 

And so it is that there are Cook Books, and Cook Books of 
all sizes, shapes, clahns and pretentions — Cook Books every- 
where — and at prices that range from "Take one," to figures 
that startle the would be purchaser. Amidst this vast number 
of books we trust there is a place for the present volume and 
that it wiU receive a friendly greeting from a goodly number 
of the careful intelligent cooks who are so intimately associated 
with the health and happiness of- our homes. Never was there 
a time when so much attention has been given to the plain 
|)ractical demands of every day life, and a cook book designed 
for liw peoi^ at laxge. containing the tbeories of no " craaka," 



nor the death dealing concoctions of any embryo professronals, 
ought to be, and we believe will be acceptable in any intelligent 
household. 

The present volume is made up of tested recipes and i» 
designed for use. Herein will be found much information that 
will interest every house-keeper. For those who desire, full 
directions are given for making the best Bread, Pastry, Soups, 
Preserves, Pickles, Sauces, and Condiments. The most ap- 
proved methods for cooking all kinds of Meats, Fish, Fowls and 
Vegetables are clearly explained, and the secrets of making 
delicious Confectionery and the richest Ice Creams are herein 
rfoen to aJl whe will read. 

The subject of e'arving is very carefully treated and very 
fully illustrated. No subject connected with house-hold man- 
ners and accomplishments deserves so much attention^, and 
scarcely any one receives so little attention as carving. The 
InslruetloQ and the illustrations herein given, if carefully 
heeded, will transform the most awkward wlelder of the kuif e 
and fork, into a personation of ease and elegance. 

The Book of Knowledge and Reliable Recipes— which is a 
part of this volume, gives more than a,thon8and ways of getting 
rich. TItese recipes are of the highest interest alike to the 
Matron and Maid, whetl^er IboMng for the useful and the 
pleasing in the home, or for beauty and. attraction in form and 
feature, to the Man who Is searching for dollars, and the Boy 
who is interested in fish and game, or in business ezperim<>nts 

This is perhaps the most valuable conpilation of Bei^^pe* 
ever given to the public.

THE EVERYDAY COOK-BOOK. 



Of all the arts npon which the physical well-being 
of man, in his social state, is dependent, none has been 
more neglected than that of cookery, though none is 
more important, for it snpjdies the very fountain of life. 
The preparation of hnman food, so as to make it at once 
wholesome, nutritive, and agreeable to the palate, has 
hitherto been beset by imaginary difficulties and strong 
prejudices. 

Many persons associate the idea of wealth with culv 
nary perfection; others consider unwholesome, as well 
as expensive, everything that goes beyond the categories 
of boiling, roasting, and the gridiron. All are aware that 
wholesome and luxurious cookery is by no means incom- 
patible with limited pecuniary means; whilst in roasted, 
boiled, and broiled meats" which constitute what is termed 
true American fare, much that is nutritive and agreeable 
is often lost for want of skill in preparing them. Food 
of every description is wholesome and digestible in pro- 
portion as it approaches nearer to the state of complete 
digestion, or, in other words, to that state termed chytne^ 
whence the chyle or milky juice that afterwards forms 
blood is absorbed, and conveyed to the heart. Kow noth- 



2 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

and thereby begin that elaboration which is consummated 
in the siomach. The preparatory process, which forms 
the cook's art, is more or less perfect in proportion as 
the aliment is softened, without losing any of its juices 
or flavor — for .flavor is not only an agreeable but a neces- 
sary accompaniment to wholesome food. Hence it fol- 
lows, that meat very much underdone, whether roasted or 
boiled, is not so wholesome as meat well done but retain- 
ing all its juices. And here comes the necessity for the 
cook's skill, which is so often at fault even in theise ■simple 
niodes of preparing human nourishment. 

Pork, veal, lamb, and all young meats, when not 
thoroughly cooked, are absolutely poison to the stomach; 
and if half-raw beef or mutton are often eaten wi h im- 
punity, it must not be inferred that they are '■ whole- 
some in their semi-crude state, but only less w)i jlesome 
than the young meats. 

Vegetables, also, half done; which is the state in 
which they are often sent to the table, are productive 
of great gastric derangement, often of a predisposition 
to cholera. 

A great variety of relishing, nutritive, and even ele- 
gant dishes, may be prepared from the most homely ma- 
terials, which may not only be rendered more nourishing, 
but be made to go much farther in a large iamily than 
they usually do. The great secret of all cookery, except 
in roasting and broiling, is a judicious use of butter, 
flour and herbs, and the application of a very slow fire — 
for good cooking requires only gentle simmering, but no 
boiling up which ouly renders the, meat hard. Good 
roasting can only be acquirecl by practice, and the perfec- 
tion lies in cooking the whole joint thoroughly without 
drying up tbe juice of any part of it. This is also the 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK, o 

case -with broiling; while a joint under process of boil- 
ing as we have said, should be allowed to simmer gently. 

With regard to made-Sishes, as the horrible imita- 
tions of French cookery prevalent in America are termed, 
we must admit that they are very unwholesome. All the 
juices are boiled out of the meat which is swimming in 
a heterogeneous compound, disgusting to the sight, and 
seasoned so strongly with spice and Cayenne pepper 
enough to inflame the stomach of an ostrich. 

French cookery is generally mild in seasoning, and 
free from grease; it is formed upon the above- stated prin- 
ciple of reducing the aliment as near to the state of chyme 
as possible, without injury to its nutritive qualities, ren- 
dering it at once easy of digestion and pleasant to the 
taste. 

HINTS ON MARKETING. 

In the first place, the housewife ought where it is 
possible, to do her marketing herself, and -pay ready 
money for everything she -purchases. This is the only 
way in which she can be sure of getting the best goods 
at the lowest price. We repeat that this is the only way 
compatible with economy; because, if a servant be en- 
trusted with the buying, she will, if she is not a good 
judge of the quality of articles, bring home those she can 
get for the least money (and these are seldom the cheap- 
est); and even if she is a good judge, it is ten to one 
against her taking the trouble to make a careful selec- 
tion. 

When the ready-money system is found inconven- 
ient, and an account is run with a dealer, the mistress of 
the house ought to have a pass-book in which she should 
write down ^U the orders herself, leaving the dealer to fill 



A THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 

in on y the prices. Where this is not done, and the mis- 
tress neglects to compare the pass-book with- the goods 
orde] ed every time they are brought in, it sometimes 
happens, -either by mistake, or the dishonesty of the 
deal«r, or the servant, that goods are entered which were 
never ordered, perhaps never had, and that those which 
were ordered are overcharged; and if these errors are not 
detected at the time, they are sure to be difficult of ad- 
justment afterwards. For these and other economic rea- 
sonB, the housewife should avoid rv\nning accounts, and 
pay ready money. 

RULES FOR EATI.N'G-. 

Dr. Hall, on this important subject, gives the fol- 
low ing advice: 

1. Never sit down to table with ait anxious or dis- 
turbed mind; 'better a hundred times intermit that meal, 
for there will then be that much more food in the world 
tor hungrier stomachs than yours; and besides, eating 
under such circumstances can only, and will always, pro- 
long and aggravate the condition of things. 

2. Never sit down to a meal after any intense mental 
effort, for physical and mental injury are inevitable, and 
no one has a right to deliberately injure body, mind, or 
estate. 

3. Never go to a full table during bodily exhaus- 
tion — designated by some as being worn out, tired to 
death, used up, overdone, and the like. The wisest thing 
to be done under such circumstances is to take a cracker 
and a cup of warm tea, either black or green, and no more. 
In ten minutes you will feel a degree of refreshn?ent and 
liveliness wbicb will be pleasantly surprising to yon; wt 



TPE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 5 

of the transient kind which a glass of liquor affords, but 
permanent ; but the tea gives present stimulus and a 
little strength, and before it subsides, nutriment begins 
to draw from the sugar, and cream, and bread, thus allow- 
ing the body gradually, and by safe degrees, to regain its 
usual vigor. Then in a couple of hours, a full meal may 
be taken, provided that it does not bring it later than 
two hours before sundown; if later, then take nothing 
for that day in addition to the cracker and tea, and the 
next day you will feel a freshness and vigor not recently 
known. 

No lady will require to be advised a second time, 
who will conform to the above rules; while it is a fact of 
no unusual observation among intelligent physicians, that 
eating heartily and under bodfly exhaustion, is not un- 
frequently the cause of alarming and painful illness, and 
sometimes sudden death. These things being so, let 
every family make it a point to assemble around the table 
with kindly feelings — with a cheerful humor, and a cour- 
teous spirit; and let that member of it be sent from it 
in disgrace who presumes to mar the reunion by sullen 
silence, or impatient look, or angry tone, or complaining 
tongue. Eat ever in thankful gladness, or away with, 
yon to the kitchen you " ill-tenipered thing that yon 
are." There was good philosophy in the old-time custom 
of having a buffoon or music at the dinner-table. 

HOW TO CHOOSE MEATS. 
Ox-beef, when it is young, will have a fine open 
grain, and a good red color; the fat should be white, for 
when it is of a deep, yellow color, the meat is seldom 
very good The grain of cow-beef is closer, the fat whiter, 
wid the lean scarcely so red as that of ox-beef. When 



« THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

you see beef of which the fat is hard and skinny, and 
the lean of a deep red, you may be sure that it is of an 
inferior kind; and when the meat is old, you may know 
it by a line of hor/iy texture running through the meat 
of the ribs. 

MuTTOn must be chosen by the firmness and fineness 
of the grain, its good color, and firm white fat. It is not 
considered prime until the ,sheep is about five years old. 

Lamb will not keep long after it is killed. It can 
be discovered by the neck end in the fore-quarter if it. 
has oeen killed too long, the veins in the neck being blu- 
ish wiien the meat is fresh, but green when it is stale. In 
the hind quarter, the same discovery may be made by 
examining the kidney and the knuckle, for the former 
has a slight smell, and the knuckle is not firm when the 
me9,t has been killed too Ion 

PoEK should have a thin rind; and when it is fresh, 
the meat is smooth and cool; but, when it looks fiabby, 
and is clammy to the touch, it is not good; and pork, 
above all meat, is disagreeable when it is stale. It you 
perceive many enlarged glands, or as they are usually 
termed, kernels, in the iat of the pork, you may con- 
clude that the pork cannot be wholesome. 

Veal is generally .preferred of a delicate whiteness, 
but is more juicy and well-flavored when of a deeper 
color. Butchers bleed calves profusely in order to pro- 
duce this white meat; but this practice must certainly 
deprive the meat of some of its nourishment and flavor. 
When you choose veal, endeavor to look at the loin, whicH 
affords the best means of judging of the veal generally, 
for if the kidneys, which may be found on the under side 
of one end of the loin, be deeply enveloped in white and 
firm-looking :b,t, the meat will certainly be good; and 




ROAST SIRLOESr 6F BEEF. 

Take a piece of sirloin, comprising ttie best part of the fillet: sawoB 
the chine bone; flatten the flap and tie it under to the fillet; trim the joint; 
tie a layer of suet over the flUet and cover the sirloin with buttered paper; 
tie it up, and put it on the spit, to roast before an even fire; ten minutes 
before the meat is done, take off the paper and sprinkle the joint with salt. 




ROAST LEG OF MTJTTOJN, 



Take a 6-lb. leg of mutton; saw off the shank bon<i one and a half 
inches below the knuckle; put it on the spit to roast belore an even fire 
for in hour and a half; put two gills of broth in the dripping-pan, and 
^aste well during cooking; sprinkle with two pinches of salt five minutes 
before taken frojn the fire. 







VEAIi— Calf's Head and Fbki., 
The pieces of veal used for roasting are: the neck, loin, and chump end 
of the loin : never buy any but very white veal, with clear, transparent fat. 
Avoid lean veal of a reddish tint, and the kidney of which is surrounded by 
red-looking fat. 







Fish.— Cakp— Eel— Pike. 
A fi-esh flsh is recognizable by the redness of the gills, the brightness 
of the eyes, and the firmness of the flesh. It Is not enough to be guided by 
the smell: it may have laid days on Ice without acauirfng a&y noticeable 
smell; but the flesh, in such a ease, will be duUaud fiacoidj anaeareBboald 
be taken not to use flsh in that ooudltion. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 7 

the same appearance will enable you to judge if it has 
been recently killed. The kidney is the part which 
changes the first; and then the suet around it becomes 
soft and the meat flabby and spotted. 

Bacon, like pork, should have a thin rind; the fat 
should be firm, and inclined to a reddish color; and the 
lean should firmly adhere to the bone, and have no yel- 
low streak in it. When you are purchasing a ham, have 
a knife stuck into it to the bone, which, if the ham be 
well cured, may be drawn out again without having any 
of the meat adhering to it, and without your perceiviilg 
any disagreeable smell. A short ham is reckoned the 
best. 

HOW TO CHOOSE FISH. 

TuBBOT, which is in season the greater part of the 
year, should have the under side of a yellowish white, for 
when it is very transparent, blue, or thin, it is not good; 
the whole fish should be thick and firm. 

Salmon should have a fine red flesh and gills ; the 
scales should be bright, and the whole fish firm. Many 
persons think that salmon is improved by keeping a day 
or two. 

CoD'ehould be judged by the redness of the gills, the 
whiteness, stiffness, and firmness of the flesh, and the 
clear freshness of the eyes ; these are the iniallible proofs 
of its being good. The whole fish should be thick and 
firm. 

WmTE-FisH may be had good almost throughout 
the year; but the time in which they are in their prime 
is early in the year. The white-fish is light and delicate, 
and in choosing it you must examine whether the fins, 
and flesh be firm. 



8 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

Feesh-Watek Fish may be chosen by similar ob- 
servations respecting the firmness of the flesh, and the 
clear appearance of the eyes, as salt-water fish. 

In a Lobster lately caught, yon may put the claws in 
motion "by pressing the eyes; but when it has been long 
caught, the muscular action, is not excited. The fresh- 
ness of boiled lobsters may be determined by the elas- 
ticity of the tail, which is flaccid when they have lost any 
of their wholesomeness. ' Their goodness, independent 
of freshness, is determined by their weight. 

Ceabs, too, must be judged of by their weight, for 
when they prove light, the flesh is generally found to be 
wasted and watery. If in perfection, the joints of the 
legs will be stiff!, g,nd the body will have an agreeable 
smell. The eyes, by a dull appearance, betray that the 
crab has been long caught. 

HOW TO CHOOSE POULTRY. 

hi the choice of poultry the age of the bird is the 
chief point to which you should attend. 

A young Tuekey has a smodth black leg; in an old 
one the legs are rough and reddish. If the bird be fresh 
killed the eyes will he full and fresh, and the meat moist. 

Fowls, when they are young, the combs and the 
legs will be smooth, and rough when they are old. 

In Geese, when they are young, the bills and the 
feet are yellow a!nd have a few hairs upon them, but they 
are red if the bird be old. The feet of a goose are pli- 
able when the bird is fresh killed, and dry and stiff when 
it has been killed some time. Geese are called green till 
they are two or three months old. 

Ducks should be chosen by their feet, which should 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 9 

be Bnpple; and they should also have a plump and hard 
breast. The feet of a tame duck are yellowish, those of 
a wild one, reddish. 

Pigeons shonld always be eaten while they are fresh; 
when they look flabby and discolored about the under 
part, they have been kept too long. The feet, like those 
of poultry, show the age of the bird; when they are 
supple, it is young; when stiff, it is old. Tame pigeons 
are larger than wild ones. 

HOW TO CHOOSE GAME. 

Venisoit, when young, will have the fat clear and 
bright, and this ought also to be of considerable thick- 
ness. When you do not wish to have it in a very high 
state, a knife plunged into either haunch or the shoulder, 
and drawn out, will by the smell enable you to judge if 
the venison is sufiiciently fresh. 

With regard to venison, which, as it is not an every- 
day article of diet, it may be convenient to keep for some 
time after it has begun to get high or tainted, it is useful 
to know that the animal putrefaction is checked by fresh 
burnt charcoal; by means of which, therefore, the veni- 
son may be prevented from getting worse, although it 
cannot be restored to its original freshness. The meat 
should be placed in a hollow dish, and the charcoal pow- 
der strewed over it until it covers the joint to the thick- 
ness of half an inch. 

Hakes and Eabbits, when the ears are dry and 
tough the haunch thick, and the claws blunt and rugged, 
they are old. Smooth and sharp claws, ears that readily 
tear, and a narrow cleft in the lip, are the marks of a 
young hare. Hares may be kept for so-ne time after 
they have been killed; Indecsd many people say they are 



10 THE EVEKYDAY COOK BOOK. 

not fit for the table until the inside begins to i yjt a 
little. Care, however, should be taken to prevei ; the 
inside from becoming musty, which yould destroy the 
flavor of the stuffing. 

Pakteidges have yellow legs and a dark-colored bilJ 
when young. They are not in season till after the firs*' 
of September. 

HOW TO CHOOSE EGG-S- 
In putting the hand round the egg, and presenting 
to the light, the end which is not covered, it should be 
transparent. If you can detect some tiny spots, it is not 
newly laid, but may be very good for all ordinary pur- 
poses except boiling soft. If you see a large spot near 
' the shell, it is bad, and should not be usM on any ac- 
count. The white of a newly-laid egg boiled soft is likie 
milk; that of an egg a day old is like rice boiled in milk ; 
^nd that of an old egg, compact, tough and difficult to 
digest. A cook ought not to give eggs two or three 
days old to people who really care for fresh eggs, under 
the delusion that they will not find any difference; for 
an amateur will find it out in a moment, not.only by the 
appearance, but also by the taste. 

CARVING-. 

The seat for the carver should be somewhat elevated 
above the other chairs; it is extremely ungraceful to 
carve standing, and it is rarely done by any person ac- 
customed to the business. Carving depends more on 
skill than on strength. "We have seen very small women 
carve admirably sitting down; and very tall men who 
knew not how to cut a piece of beefsteak without rim^g 
on their feet to do it. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 11 

The carving-knife should be very sharp, and not 
heavy; and it should be held firmly in the hand; also 
the dish should not be too far from the carver. It is 
customary to serve the fish with a fish-trowel, and ngt 
with a knife. The middle part of a fish is generally con- 
sidered the best. In serving it, avoid breaking the 
flakes, as that will give it a mangled appearance. 

In carving ribs or sirloin of beef begin by cutting 
thin slices oflE the side next to you. Afterwards you may 
cut from the tenderloin, or cross-part near the lower end. 
Do not send anyone the outside piece, unless you know 
they particularly wish it. 

In serving beefsteak put none of the bone on the 
plate. In cutting a round of corned beef begin at the 
top; but lay aside the first cut or outside piece, and send 
it to no one, as it is always dry and hard. In a round of 
beefa-la mode the outside is frequently preferred. 

A leg of mutton begin across the middle, cutting 
the slices quite down to the bone. The same with a leg 
of pork or a ham. The latter should be cut in very thin 
slices, as its flavor is spoiled when cut thick. 

To taste well, tongue should be cut crossways in 
round slices. Cutting it lengthwise (though the practice 
at many tables) injures the flavor. The middle part of 
the tongue is the best. Do not help anyone to a piece 
of the root; that, being by no means a favored part, is 
generally left in the dish. 

In carving a fore-quarter of lamb first separate the 
shoulder part from the breast and ribs by passing the 
knife under, and then divide the ribs. II the lamb is 
large, have another dish brought to put the shoulder in. . 

For a loin of veal begin near the smallest end, and 
separate the ribs; serving a part of the kidney (as far as 



12 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK 

it will go) with each.piece. Carve a loin of pork or mut- 
ton in the same manner. 

In carving a fillet of veal begin at the top. Many 
persons prefer the first cut or outside piece. Serve a 
portion of the stuffing with each slice. 

In a breast of veal there are two parts very different 
in quality, the ribs and the brisket. You will easily per- 
ceive the division; enter your knife at it and cut through, 
which will separate the two parts. Ask the person you 
are going to help whether they prefer a rib or a piece of 
the brisket. ' 

For a haunch of venison first make a deep incision 
by passing your knife all along the side, cutting quite 
down to the bone. This is to let out the gravy. Then 
turn the broad end of the haunch toward you, and cut it 
as deep as you can in thin slices, allowing some of the 
fat to each person. 

For a saddle of venison, or of mutton, (5ut from the 
tail to the other end on each side of the backbone, mak- 
ing very thin slices, and sending some fat with each. 
Venison and roast mutton chill very soon. Currant jelly 
is an indispensable appendage to venison, and to roast 
mutton and to ducks. 

A young pig is most generally divided before it 
comes to table, in which case it is not customary to send 
in the head, as to many persons it is a revolting spec- 
tacle after it is cut oif. When served up whole, first 
separate the head from the shoulders, then cut off the 
limbs, and then divide the ribs. Serve some of the stuff- 
ing with each piece. 

To carve a fowl, begin by sticking your fork in the 
pinion, and draw it towards the leg; and then passing 
your knife underneath take off the wing at the joint* 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 13 

Next, slip your knife between the leg and the body, to 
cut through the joint; and with the fork turn the leg 
back, and the joint will give way. Then take off the 
other wing and leg. If the fowl has oeen trussed (as it 
ought to be) with the liver and gizzard, help the liver 
with one wing, and the gizzard with the other. The 
liver-wing is considered the best. After the limbs are 
taken off enter your knife into the top of the breast, and 
cut under the merry-thought, so as to loosen it, lifting it 
with your fork. Afterwards cut slices from both sides 
of the breast. Next take off the collar-bones, which lie 
on each side of the merry-thought, and then separate the 
side-bones from the back. The breast and wings are 
considered the most delicate parts of the fowl; the back, 
as the least desirable, is generally left in the dish. Some 
persons, in carving a fowl, find it more convenient to 
take it on a plate, and as they separate it return each 
part to the dish, but this is not the usual way. 

A turkey is carved in the same manner as a fowl; 
except that the legs and wings, being larger, are sep- 
arated at the loW'Cr joint. The lower part of the 
leg (or drum-stick, as it is called), being hard, tough, 
and stringy, is never served to any one, but allowed to 
remain in the dish. First cut off the wing, leg, and 
breast from one side; then turn the turkey over, and cut 
them off from the other, j 

To carve a goose separate the leg from the body, by 
putting the fork into the small end of the limb ; press- 
ing it close to the body, and then passing the knife un- 
der, and turning the leg back, as you cut through the 
joint. To take off the wing, put your tork into small 
end of the pinion, and press it closely to the body; then 
slip the knife under, and separate the joint, '^ext cut

cx>d'3 head and shodldbbs. 

Introduce the fish-slice at 1, and out quite through the back, as far 
as 2, then help pieces from between 3 and 4, and with each slice give 
a portion of the sound, which lines the under side of the back 
bone. It is thin, and of a darker color than the other part of the fish, 
and is esteemed a delicacy. 

Some persons are partial to the tongue and palate, for which you 
must insert a spoon into the mouth. The jelly part is about the 
jaw.lhe firm part within the head, on which are some other delicate 
pickings; the finest portions may be found about the shoulders. 




TUBBOf. 

The under Side of this fish is the most esteemed, and ib placed up- 
permost on the dish. - The fish-slice must be introduced at 1, and an 
incision made as far as 2; then cut from the middle, which is the 
primest part. After helping the whole of that side, the upper part 
must be attacked, and as it is difficult to divide the back bone, raise 
it with the fork, whUe you separate a portion with the fish-slice; this 
part is mere solid, and is preferred by some, though it is less delicate 
than the under side. The fins are esteemed a nicety, and should be 
attended to accordingly. 

BKILXi, BOUSS, FIiAICE, 

and all fish in general, may be served in the same manner as a Turbot. 



CABVINO. 
SECTION II. 

JOINTS. 

In helping the more fleshy joints, such as a Sirloin of Beef, Leg of 
Mutton, Fillet of Veal, out thin smooth ellces, and let the knife pass 
through to the bones of Mutton and Beef. 

In some boiled joints, round an aitch-bone of beef for instance, 
the water renders the outsides v^pid, and of course unfit to be eaten; 
you will therefore be particular to cut oflf and lay aside a thick slice 
from ttie ton, before you begin to serve. 




SHODLDEB as MTriTON. 

Cut in to the boQO at the line l,and help thin slices of lean from 
each side of the inuision; the prime part of the fat lies at the outer 
edge, at 2. 

Should more meat be required than can be got from that part, cut 
on either side of the line 3, which represents the blade-bone, and some 
good and delicate slices may be procured. By cutting horizontally 
from the under side, many "nice bits" will be obtained. 




liEQ OF MUTTON. 

The finest part is situated in the center, at 1, between the knucMa 
and farther end; insert the knife there, and cut thin, deep slices each 
wa;y, as far in as 3. The outside rarely being very fat, some neat cuts 
may be pbtained off the broad end, at 3. The knuckle of a fine leg is 
tender, though dry, and many prefer it, although the other is the 
most j#ioy. There are some good cuts on the broad end of the back 
of ^le l(Bg, from whiBh slices-may be procured lengthwise. 

"Ehft era.mp bone is by some esteemed a delicacy; to get it out, out 
down to the thighbone, at 4, and pass the knife under it in a semicir' 
oular course, to 6. 



OARVINQ. 

UanH OP MUTTON. 

Ab the bones of this joint are divided, it is very easily managed. 
Begin at the nanow end and take off the chops; when the joints are 
cut througli, some slices of meat may be obtained between tbebonett. 




FOBE QUABTEB OF LAMB. 

First divide the shoulder from the scoven, which consists of the 
breast and ribs, by passing the kniEe under the knuckle, in the direc- 
tion of 1, 2, 3, and cutting- so as to leave a fair ijortion of meat on the 
libs; lay it on a separate dish, and squeeze the juice of half a Seville 
orange over the other part, which, after being sprinkled with pepper 
and salt, should be divided in the line 3-4. This will separate the ribs 
from the gristly part, and you may help from either, as may' be 
chosen, cutting as directed by the lines 5, 6. 

IX)TS OF IjAMB I 

may be helped similar to a loin of mutton. (See liOiN of mutton.) 
This,, and the two foregoing, being small joints, should be helped 
sparingly, as there is very little meat on them, especially when first 
in season. 




AITCH-BONB OP BEEP. 

Cut off and lay aside a thick slice from the entire surface, as 
marked 1-2, then help. There are two sorts of fat to this joint, and, 
as tastes differ, it is necessary to learn which is preferred The solid 
fat will be found at 3, and must be cut horizontally; the softer, which 
resembles marrow, at the back of the bone, below 4. 

A silver skewer should be substituted for the one which keep^ the 
meat4)roperly together while boiling, and it may be withdrawn whep 
you cut down to it. 



OABVIJm. 



StBLOIN OF BXBF. 



There are two modes of helping this joint. The better way is bj 
carving long, thin slices; the other way is by cutting it across, which 
however, spoils it. There will also be found some delicate fat, par 
of Which should be given with each piece. 



EIB3 OB BEEF 



. may be carved similar to the Sirloin, always commencing at the thii 
end of the joint, and cutting long slices so as to give fat and leai 
together. 




A TONGWE. 

Cut nearly through the middle, at the line 1, and take thin slice 
from each side. The fat is situated Underiieath, at the root of th 
■tongue. I 




A CALF'S HEAD. 

Cut thin slices from 1 to 2, and let the knife penetrate to the bom 
At the thick part of the neck end, 3, the throat sweetbread is siti 
ated; carve slices from 3 to 4, and help with the other part. Sh oul 
the eye be asked for, it must be extracted with the point of the k nif 
and a portion given. The palate, esteemed a delicacy, is situate 
under the head, and some flie lean may be found by removing th 
jaw-bone, portions of each of these should be helped round. 



CARVim. 



A BKEAflT OP VEAIi 



is composed of the ribs and brisket, which must be separated H' tat- 
ting through the line 1-2; the latter is the thickest and hat fvis- 
tles. Divide each portion into convenient pieces, and proceed t> '> Ip, 




FILLET OP VEAL 



resembles a round of beef, and should be carved similar to it, in thin 
and very smooth slices, off the top; cut deep into the flap, between 1 
and 2, for the stuffing, and help a portion of it to each person. 
Slices of -lemon are always served with this dish. 



HAND OP PORK. 



Cut thin slices from this delicate joint, either across near the 
knuckle, or from the blade bone, as directed for a shoulder of mut- 
ton. • This forms a nice dish for a tete-a-tete dinner; there is not suf- 
ficient for a third person. 




KOAST PIG. 

As this is usually divided as above, before sent to table, little 
remains to be carved. First separate a shoulder from the body, and 
then the leg; divide the ribs into convenient portions, and send round 
with a Sufficiency of the stuffing and gravy. Many prefer the neck 
and between the shoulders, although the ribs are considered the 
finest part; but as this all depends oh taste, the question should be 
pirt -The ear is reckoned a delicacy. 

Should the head not be divided, it must be done, and the brains 
taken ovlt,. and mixed with the gravy and stuffing. 

_,", . -'* A LOIN OP PORK 

is out up iu the ej^me manner as a loia of Mutton. See pa|{e xU. 



CARVimi, 




The usual mode of carving this joint, is by long delicate slices, 
through the thick fat, in the direction 1-2, laying open the bone at 
each out, which brings you to the prime part at once. A more sav- 
ing way is to commence at the knuckle and proceed onwards. 

Some persons take out a round piece at 3, and enlarge the hole, by 
cutting thin circular slices with a sharp knife. This keeps the meat 
moist, and preserves the gravy, but seldom looks handsome. 



SECTION III. 

POULTBY, GAME, ETC. 

The carving knife for poultry is smaller and lighter than the meat 
carver; the point is more peaked and the handle longer. 

In cutting up a Turkey, Goose, Duck or Wild Fowl, more prime 
pieces may be obtained by carving slices from pinion to pinion, with- 
out making wings; this is an advantage when your party is large, as 
it makes the bird go farther. 




It will be more convenient in carving this to take it on your plate, 
and lay the joints, as divided, neatly on the dish. Fix your fork in 
the iniddle of the breast, and take the wing off in the direction of 
1-2: divide the joint at 1, lift up the pinion with your fork, and draw 
the wing toward the leg, which will separate the fleshy part more 
naturally than by the knife; cut between the leg and body at 3 to 
the bond 2, give the blade a sudden turn, and the joint will break 



CARVING. 

K he fowl is not old. When a Bimilsr operation is performed on the 
ot ^er side, take off the merrythought, by cutting into the bone at 4, 
anH turning it ba^, which will detach it J next remove the neck 
bones and divide tm breast from the back, by cutting through the 
whole of the ribs, close to the breast. Turn up the back, ;pr«ss the 
point of the knife about half way between the neck and ruH^, and 
on raising the lower end it will separate easily. Turn the rump from 
you, take off the sidesmen, and the operation is complete. 

The breast and wings are the most delicate parts, but the leg is 
more juicy in a young bird. Great care should be taken to cut the 
wings as handsome as possible. 

A TTJBKET. 

The finest parts of this bird are the breast and wings; the latte' 
will bear some delicate- slices being taken oB After the fore quar- 
ters are severed, the thighs must be divided from the drumsticks, 
which, being tough, should be reserved till last. In other respects, 
a turkey must be dealt with exactly as recommended for a fowl, ex- 
cept that it has no merrythought. 

Give a portion of the stufSng or forced-meat, which is inside the 
breast, to each person. 

A PAKTKrDGE 

s cut up in the same manner as a fowl, only, on account of the small' 
ness of the bird, the merrythought is seldom divided from the breast' 
The wings, breast, and merrythought are the finest parts of it, but 
the wing is considered the best, and the tip of it is reckoned the 
the most delicious morsel of the whole. 

WOODCOCKS, GROUSE, BTO. 

are carved similar to a fowl, if not too small, when they may be out 
in quarters and helped. 
Snipes, being smaller, should be divided in halves. 




PIGEONS. 



The usual way of carving these birds is to insert the knife at I, and 
cut to 2 and 8, when each portion may ,be divided into tWe pieces 
and helped; sometimes they are cut in halves, either across or down 
rfie middle, but as the lower part is thought the best, the firs* mod« 
is the fairest. 



14 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

under the merry- thougM, and take it off; and then cut 
slices from the breast. Then turn the goose, and dis- 
member the other side. Take off the two upper side- 
bones that are next to the wings, and then the two lower- 
side bones. The breast and legs of a goose afford the 
finest pieces. If a goose is old there is no fowl so tough ; 
and, if difficult to carve, it will be still more difficult to 
eat. 

Partridges, pheasants, grouse, etc., are carved in the 
same manner as fowls. Quails, woodcocks, and snipes 
are merely split down the back ; so also are pigeons, giv- 
ing a half to each person. 

In serving any one to gravy, or to melted butter, do 
not pour it over their meat, fowl, or fish, but put it to 
one side on a vacant part of the plate, that they may use 
just as much of it as they like. In filling a plate never 
heap one thing on another. 

In serving vegetables, do not plunge the spoon 
down to the bottom of the dish, in case they should not 
have been perfectly well drained, and the water should 
have settled there. 

By observing carefully how it is done you may ac- 
quire a knowledge of the joints, and of the process of 
carving, which a little daily practice will convert into 
dexterity. If a young lady is ignorant of this useful art, 
it will be well for her to take lessons of her father, or her 
brother, and a married lady can easily learn from, her 
husband. Domestics who wait at table may soon,, from 
looking on daily, become so expert that, when neces- 
sary, they can take a dish to the side-table and carve it 
perfectly well. 

At a dinner-party, if the hostess is quite young, she 
is frequently glad to be relieved of the trouble of carv. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 15 

ing by tlie gentleman who sits nearest to her; but it she 
is familiar with the business, she usually prefers doing 
it herself. 

SOUPS. 



GENERAL EEMAEKS. 

Be careful to proportion the quantity of water to 
that of the meat. Somewhat less than a quart of water 
to a pound of meat is a good rule for common soups. 
Ilich soups, intended for company, may have a still 
smaller allowance of water. 

Soup should always be made entirely of fresh meat 
that has not been previously cooked. An exception to 
this rule may sometimes be made in favor of the re- 
mains of a piece of roast beef that has been very miick 
under-done in roasting. This may be added to a good 
piece of raw meat. Cold ham, also, may be occasion- 
ally put into white soups. 

Soup, however, that has been original!}' made of 
raw meat entirely is frequently better the second day 
than the first, provided it is reboiled only for a very 
short time, and that no additional water is added to it. 

Unless it has been allowed to boil too hard, so as to 
exhaust the wpter, the soup-pot will not require replen- 
ishing. When it is found absolutely necessary to do so, 
the additional water must be boiling-hot when poured in;' 
-if lukewarm or cold, it will entirely sj)oil the soup. 

Every particle of fat should be carefully skimmed 
from the surface. Greasy soup is disgusting^and un- 
wholesome. The lean ot meat is much better for soup 
than the fat. 

Long and slow boiling is necessary to extract the 
strength from the meat. If boiled fast over a large fire, 



16 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

the meat becomes Hard and tough, and will not give out 
its juices. 

Potatoes, if boiled in the soup, are thought hy some 
^to render it unwholesome, from the opinion that the wa- 
ter in which potatoes have been cooked is almost a poi- 
son. As potatoes are a part of every dinner, it is very 
easy to take a few out of the pot in which they have 
been boiled by themselves, and to cut them up and add 
them to the soup just before it goes to the ta^Jjle. Ee- 
move all shreds of meat and bone. 

The cook should season the soup but very slightly 
with salt and pepper. If she puts in too much it may 
spoil it for the taste of most of those who are to. eat it; 
but if too little it is easy to add more to your own plate. 

STOCK SOUP. 

Four pounds of shin of beef, or four pounds of 
knuckle of veal, or two pounds of each; any bones, trim- 
mings of poultry, or fresh meat, quarter pound of lean 
bacon or ham, two ounces of butter, two large onions, 
each stuck with cloves; one turnip, three carrots, one 
head of celery, three lumps of sugar, two ounces of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of whole pepper, one large blade of 
mace, one bunch of savory herbs, four quarts and half 
^pint of cold water. 

Out up the meat and bacon, or ham; into pieces of 
about three inches square; rub the butter on the bottom 
of the stewpan; put in half a pint of water, the meat, 
and all the other ingredients. Cover the stewpan, and 
place it on a sharp fire, occasionally stirring its contents. 
When the bottom of the pan becomes covered with a 
pale, jelly-like substance, add the four quarts of cold 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 17 

water, and simmer very gently for five hours. As we 
have said before, do not let it boil quickly. Remove 
every particle of scum while it is doing, and strain it 
through a fine hair sieve. 

This stock is the basis of many of the soups after- 
wards mentioned, and will be found quite strong enough 
for ordinary purposes. 

Time : Five and one-half hours. Average cost, twen- 
ty-five cents per quart. 

WHITE STOCK SOUP. 

Six pounds knuckle of veal, half pound lean bacon, 
two tablespoontuls of butter rubbed in one of flour, two 
onions, two carrots, two turnips, three cloves stuck in an 
onion, one blade of mace, banch of herbs, six quarts of 
water, pepper and salt, one cup of boiling milk. 

Cut up the meat and crack the bones. Slice carrots, 
turnips, and one onion, leaving that with the cloves 
whole. Put on: with mace, aud all the herbs except the 
parsley, in two quarts of cold water. Bring to a slow 
boil; take off the scum, as it rises, and at the end of an 
hour's stewing, add the rest of the cold water — one gal- 
lon. Cover and cook steadily, always gently, four hours. 
Strain off the liquor, of which there should be about five 
quarts; rub the vegetables through the colander, and 
pick out bones and meat. Season these highly and put, 
as is your Saturday custom, into a wide-mouth jar, or a 
large bowl. Add to them three quarts of stock, well 
salted, and, when cold, keep on ice. Cool to-day's stock; 
remove the fat, season, put in chopped parsley, and put 
over the fire. Heat in a saucepan a cup of milk, stir in 
the floured butter; cook three minutes. When the soup 



18 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

has simmered ten minutes after the last boil, and been 
carefully skimmed, pour into the tureen, and stir in the 
hot thickened milk. 

SHIN OF BEEF SOUP. 

Get a shin-bone of beef weighing four or five pounds; 
let the butcher saw it in pieces about two inches long, 
that the marrow may become the better incorporated 
with the sonp, and so give it greater richness. 

Wash the meat in cold water; mix together of salt 
and pepper each a tablespoonf ul, rub this well into the 
meat, then put into a soup-pot; put to it as many quarts 
of water as there are pounds of meat, and set it over a 
moderate fire, until it comes to a boil, then take oH" what- 
ever scum may have risen, after which cover it close, and 
set it where it will boil very gently for two hours longer, 
then skim it again, and add to it the proper vegetables, 
which are these — one large carrot grated, one large turnip 
cut in slices (the yellow or ruta baga is best), one leek 
cut in slices, one bunch of parsley cut small, six small 
potatoes peeled and cut in half, and a teacupful of pearl 
barley well washed, then cover it and let it boil gently 
for one hour, at which time add another tablespoonful of 
salt and a thickening made of a tablespoonful of wheat 
fiour and a gill of water, stir it in by the spoonful; cover 
it for fifteen minutes and it is done. 

Three hours and a half is required to make this 
soup; it the best for cold weather. Should any remain 
over the first day, it may be heated with the addition of 
a little boiling water, and served again. - 

Take the meat from the soup, and if to be served 
with it, take out the bone* and lay it closely and neatly 



THE EVEErOAY COOK BOOK. 19 

on a dish, ana garnish with sprigs of parsley ; serve made 
mnstard and catsup with it. It is very nice pressed and 
eaten with muBtard and vinegar or catsup. 

MUTTON SOUP WITH TAPIOCA 

Three pbunds perfectly lean mutton. The scrag 
makes good soup and costs little. Two or three pounds 
of bones well pounded, one onion, two turnips, two car- 
rots, two stalks of celery, a few sprigs of parsley; it you 
have any tomatoes left from yesterday, add them, four 
tablespoonfuls of pearl or granulated tapioca (not heap- 
ing spoonfuls), four quarts of water. 

Put On the meat, cut in small pieces, with the bones, 
in two quarts of cold water. Heat very slowly, and when 
it boils, poui ii^- two quarts of hot water from the kettle. 
Chop the vegetables, cover with cold water. So soon as 
they begin to simmer, throw off the first water, replen- 
ishing with hot,\ and stew until tliey are boiled to pieces. 
The meat- should cook steadily, jiever fast, five hours, 
keeping the pot-lid on. Strain into a great bowl; let it 
cool to throw the fat to the surface; skim and return to 
the fire. Season with pepper and salt, boil up, take off 
the scum; add the vegetables with their liquor. Heat 
together ten minutes, strain again, and bring to a slow 
boil before the tapioca goes in. This shoitld have been 
soaked for one hour in cold water, then cooked in the 
same within another vessel of boiling water until each 
grain is clear. It is necessary to stir up often from the 
bottom while cooking. Stir gradually into the soup 
until the tapioca is dissolved. 

Send around grated cheese with this soup. 



20 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

VEAL SOUP 

To about three pounds of a joint of veal, which 
must be well broken up, put four quarts of water and 
set it over to boil. Prepare one-fourth pound of maca- 
roni by boiling it by itself, with sufficient water to cover 
it; add a little butter to the macaroni when it is tender, 
strain the soup and season to taste with salt and pepper, 
then add the macaroni in the water in which it is boiled. 
Tlie addition of a pint of rich milk or cream and celery 
flavor is relished by many. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

Take two ox tails and two whole onions, two carrots, 
a small turnip, two tablespoonfuls ot flour, and a little 
white pepper, add a gallon of water, let all boil tor two 
hours; then take out the tails and cut the meat into 
small pieces, return the bones to the pot, for a short 
time, boil for another hour, then strain the soup, and 
rinse two spoonfuls of arrowroot to add to it with the 
meat cut from the bones, and let all boil for a quarter of 
an hour. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Two pounds of coarse, lean beef, cut into strips, two 
pounds of knuckle of veal chopped to pieces, two pounds 
of mutton bones, and the bones left from your cold veal 
cracked to splinters, pound of lean ham, four large car- 
rots, two turnips, two onions, bunch of herbs, three 
tablespoonfuls of butter, and two of flour, one table- 
spoonful of sugar, salt and pepper, seven quarts of water. 

Put on meat, bones, herbs and water, and cook slow- 
ly five hours. Strain the soup, of which there should 
be five quarts. Season meat and bones, and put into the 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 21 

stock-pot with three quarts of liquor. Save this for days 
to come. While the soup for to-day is cooling that you 
may take off the fat, put the butter into a frying pan 
with sliced carrots, turnips and onions, and fry to a light 
brown. Now, add a pint of the skimmed stock, and 
stew the vegetables tender, stir in the flour wet with wa- 
ter, and put all, with your cooled stock, over the fire in 
the soup-kettle. Season with sugar, Cayenne pepper 
and salt, boil five minutes, rub through a colander, then 
a soup-sieve, heat almost to boiling, and serve 

MACARONI SOUP. 

To a rich beef or other soup, in which there is no 
seasoning other than pepper or salt, take half a pound of 
small pipe macaroni, boil it in clear water until it is ten- 
der, then drain it and cut it in pieces of an inch in 
length, boil it lor fifteen minutes in the soup and serve. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Swell quarter of a pound of vermicelli in a quart of 
warm water, then add it to a good beef, veal, lamb or 
chicken soup or broth with quarter of a pound of sweet 
butter; let the soup boil for fifteen minutes after it is 
added. 

CHICKEN CREAM SOUP. 

Boil an old fowl, with an onion, in fonr quarts of 
cold water, until there remain but two quarts. Take 
it out and let it get cold. Cut ofi^ the whole of the 
breast, and chop very fine. Mix with the pounded yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs, and rub through a colander. 
Cool, skim, and strain the soup into a soup-pot. Season, 



22 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

add the chicken-and-egg mixture, simmer ten minutes, 
and pour into the tureen. Then add a small cup of boil- 
ing milk. 

MOCK-TURTLE SOUP. 

Clean and wash a calf's head, split it in two, save the 
brains, boil the head until tender in plenty of water; put 
a slice of fat ham, a bunch of parsley cut small, a sprig 
of thyme, two leeks cut small, six cloves, a teaspoonful 
of pepper and three ounces of butter, into a gtew-pan, 
and fry them a nice brown ; then add the water in which 
the head was boiled, cut the meat from the head in neat 
square pieces, and put them to the soup ; add a pint of 
Madeira and one lemon sliced thin, and Cayenne pepper 
and salt to taste; let it simmer gently for two hours, 
then skim it clear and serve. 

Make a forcemeat of the brains as follows: Put 
them in a stew pan, pour hot water over, and set it over 
the fire for a few minutes, then take them up, chop them 
small, with a sprig of parsley, a saltspoonful of salt and 
pepper each, a tablespoonful of wheat flour, the same of 
butter, and one well-beaten egg; make it in small balls, 
and drop them in the soup fifteen minutes before it is 
taken from the fire; in making the balls, a little more 
flour may be necessary. Egg-balls may also be added. 

HABD PEA SOUP. 

Many persons keep the bones of their roast in order 
to convert them into stock for pea soup, which is, to my 
taste, one of the most relishable of all soups, and a fa- 
mous dish for cold weather, with this advantage in its 
favor, that it may be made from almost anything. Cap- 
ital stock for pea soup can be mnrlp. from a knuckle of 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOIC 23 

ham or from a piece of pickled pork. Supposing that 
some such stock is at hand to the extent of about two 
quarts, procure, say, two pounds of split peas, wash them 
well, and then soak them for a night in water to which 
a very little piece of soda has been added (the Hoating 
peas should be all thrown away), strain out the peas and 
place them in the stock, adding a head of celery, a cut- 
down carrot and a large onion or two, and season with a 
pinch of curry powder, or half an eggspoonful of Cay- 
enne pepper. Boil with a lid on the pot till all is sott, 
skimming off the scum occasionally, and then carefully 
strain into a well-warmed tureen, beating the pulp 
through the strainer with a spoon. Serve as hot as pos- 
sible, placing a breakfastcupful of crumbled toast (bread) 
into the tureen before the soup is dished. Much of the 
success in preparing this soup lies in the "straining," 
which ought to be carefully attended to. A wire sieve 
is best; but an active housewife must never stick. If 
she has not a sieve made for the purpose, she can fold a 
piece of net two or three times, and use that. When a 
knuckle of ham has been used to make the stock it 
should form a part of the dinner, with potatoes, or it 
may be used as a breakfast or supper relish. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Wash a small quarter of lamb in cold water, and 
put it into a soup-pot with six quarts of cold water; add 
to it two tablespoonfuls of salt, and set it over a moder- 
ate fire — let it boil gently for two hours, then sldm it 
clear, add a quart of shelled peas, and a teaspoonful of 
pepper; cover it, and let it boil for half an hour, then 
having scraped the skins from a quart of small young 
potatoes, add them to theaoup; cover the pot, and let 



24 THE EVEBTDAT COOK BOOK. ^ 

it boil for half an hour longer; work quarter of a pound 
of butter, and a dessert spoonful of flour together, and 
add them to the soup ten or twelve minutes before tak- 
ing it off the fire. 

Serve the meat on a dish with parsley sauce over, 
and the soup in a tureen. 

POTATO SOUP 

Potato soup is suitable for a cold day. Make it in 
the following manner: Get as many beef or ham bones 
as you can, and smash them into fragments. Add a little 
bit of lean ham to give flavor. Boil the bone and ham 
for two hours and a half at least. The bone of a roast 
beef is excellent. Strain off the liquor carefully, empty 
the bones and debris of the ham, restore the liquor to the 
pot, and place again on the fire. Having selected, washed 
and pared some nice potatoes, cut them into small pieces, 
and boil them in the stock till they melt away. An 
onion or two may also be boiled among the bones to help 
the flavor. I do not like thick potato soup, and I usu- 
ally strain it through a hair sieve, after doing so placing 
it again on the fire, seasoning it with pepper and salt to 
taste. A stick of celery boiled with the bones is an im- 
provement. Make only the quantity required for the 
day, as potato soup is best when it is newly made. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Tomato soup is a much relished American dish, and 
is prepared as follows: Steam, or rather stew slowly, a 
mess of turnips, carrots, and onions, also a stalk of celery, 
witij ball i pem4 af leas "mtk ap4 a lUth Ui ef freib 



quarts of diluted stock or of other liquor in which meat 
has been boiled, as also eight or ten ripe tomatoes. Stew 
the whole for an hour and a half, then pass through the 
sieve into the pan again; add a little pepper and salt, 
boil for ten minutes and serve hot. 

G-AME SOUP. 

Two grouse or partridges, or if you have neither, use 
a pair ot rabbits; half a pound of lean Lam; two medium- 
sized onions; one pound of lean beef, fried bread; butter 
for frying; peppei-, salt, and two stalks of white celery 
cut into inch lengths; three quarts of water. 

Joint your game neatiy; cut the ham and onions 
into small pieces, and fry .:. ■-. butter to a light brown. 
Put into a soup-pot with the J^eef, cut into strips, and a 
little pepper. Pour ou '■'.o water; heat slowly, and stew 
gently two hours. Take out the pieces of bird, and cover 
in a bowl; cook the soup an hour longer; strain; cool; 
drop in the celery, and simmer ten minutes. Pour upon 
fried bread in the tureen. 

CELERY SOUP. 

Celery soup may be made with white stock. Cut 
down the white of half a dozen heads of celery into little 
pieces and boil it in four pints of white stock, with a 
quarter of a pound of lean ham and two ounces of butter. 
Simmer gently for a full hour, then drain through a sieve, 
return the liquor to pan and stir in a few spoonsful of 
cream with great care. Serve with toasted bread, and, if 
liked, thicken with a little flour. Season to taste. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Two qriart& of oyBters, one quart of milk, two table- 



gpooninlg of butter, one teaonpftil hot watei^ pepper, 
salt. 

Strain all the liquor f pom the oysters; add the water 
and heat. When near the boil, add the seasoning, then 
the oysters. Cook about five minutes from the time 
they begin to simmer, until fekey " ruffle." Stir in the 
butter; cook one minute and po»r in-to tlie tureen. Stir 
in the boiling milk, and send t© table. 

IRISH STEW.-STOVED POTATOES. 

These form excellent and nutritious dishes. The 
former dish can be made from a portion of the back ribs 
or neck of mutton, the fleshy part of which must be cut 
into cutlets. Flatten these places of meat with a roller, 
and dip them in a composition of pepper, salt and flour. 
Peel potatoes and slice them to the extent of two pounds 
of potatoes for every pound of meat. An onion or two 
sliced into small bits will be required. Before building 
the materials into a goblet, melt a little suet or dripping 
in it, then commence by laying in the pot a layer of po- 
tatoes, which dust well with pepper and salt, then a layer 
of meat sprinkled with the chopped onions, and so on 
till the goblet is pretty full. Fill in about a breakfast- 
cupful of the gravy, if there be any in the house; if not, 
water will do. Finish off with a treble row of potatoes 
on the top. Let the mess stew slowly for about three 
hours, taking great care to keep the lid so tight that none 
of the virtue can escape — letting away the steam is just 
letting away the flavor. Shake the pot- occasional Ij'' with 
some force, to prevent burning. Some cooks in prepar- 
ing this dish, boil the potatoes for some time, and then 
pour and dry then> well; others add a portion of kidney 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 27 

to the stew; while extravagant people throw in a few 
oysters, a slice or two of lean ham, or a ham shank. 
Irish stew should be served as ho> as possible. It is a 
savory and inexpensive dish for cold weather. — Stoved 
potatoes are prepared much in the same way. Cut down 
what of the Sunday's roast is left, and proceed with it 
just as you would with the neck of mutton. Some cooks 
would stew the bones of the roast, in order to make a 
fl^ravy in wliich to stove the meat and potatoes, but the 
oones will make excellent p«tato soup. Irish stew is an 
excellent dish for skaters and curlers. It is sometimes 
known as "hot pot." 

TO Q-ET UP A SOUP IN HASTE. 

Chop some cold cooked meat fin-e, and put a pint 
into a stew-pan with some gravy, season with pepper and 
salt and a little butter if the gravy is not rich, add a 
little flour moistened with cold wat«r, and three pints 
boiling water, boil moderately half an hour. Strain over 
some rice or nicely toasted bread, and serve. Uncooked 
meat may be used by using o«ne quart of cold water to .\ 
pound of chopped meat, and letting it stand half an hour 
before boiling. Celery root may be grated in as season- 
ing, or a bunch of parsley thrown in. 

TO COLOR SOUPS. 

A fine amber color is obtained by adding finely. 
p-ated carrot to the clear •tock when it is quite free from 
Beam. 

Red is obtained by ufiijag red skinned tomatoes from 
which the Bkins and seeds have been strained out. 



28 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 

Only white vegetables should be used in whi 
soups, as chicken. 

Spinach leaves, pounded in a mortar, and the jui 
expressed, and addeil to the soups, will give a grei 
coior. 

Black beans make an excellent brown soup. Tl 
same color can be gotten by adding burnt sugar 
browned flour to clear stock.

FISH. 



Fish are good, when the gills are red, eyes are fuU, 
and the body of the fish is firm and stiff. After wash- 
ing them well, they should be allowed to remain for a 
short time in salt water sufficient to cover them; before 
cooking wipe theiti dry, dredge lightly with flour, and 
season with salt and pepper. Salmon, trout and other 
small fish are usually fried or broiled; all large fish 
should be put in a cloth, tied closely with twine, and 
placed in cold water, when they may be put over the 
fire to boil. When fish are baked, prepare the fish the 
same as for boiling, and put in the oven on a wire grid- 
iron, over a dripping pan. 

BOILED SALMON. 

The middle slice of salmon is the best. Sew up 
neatly in a mosquito-net bag, and boil a quarter of an 
hour to the pound in hot, salted water. When done, un- 
wrap with care, and lay upon a hot dish, taking care not 
to break it. Have ready a large cupful of drawn butter, 
very rich, in which has been stii'red a tablespoonful of 
minced parsley and the juice of a lemon. Pour half up- 
on the salmon, and serve the rest in a boat. Garnish 
with parsley and sliced eggs. 

Here is a recipe for a nice -pickle for cold salmon 



60 THE EVERTDAr COOK BOOK. 

made out of the liquor in which the fish has been boiled, 
of which take as much as you wish, say three breakfast 
cupfuls, to which add vinegar to taste, (perhaps a tea- 
cupful will be enough), a good pinch of pepper, a 
dessert-spoonful of salt. Boil for a few minutes with a 
sprig or two of parsley and a little thyme. After it has 
become quite cold, pour it over the fish. 

BROILED SALMON. 

Cut some slices about an inch thick, and broil them 
over a gentle bright fire ot coals, for ten or twelve min- 
iates. "When both sides are done, take them on to a hot 
dish; butter each slice well with sweet butter; strew over 
each a very little salt and pepper to taste, and serve. 

BAKED SALMON. 

Clean the fish, rinse it, and wipe it dry ; rub it well 
outside and in, with a mixture of pepper and salt, and 
fill it with a stufiing made with slices of bread, buttered 
freely and moistened with hot milk or water (add sage 
or thyme to the season if liked) ; tie a thread around the 
fish so as to keep the stuffing in (take off the thread be- 
fore serving); lay muffin rings, or a feci vet in a dripping 
pan, lay bits of butter over the fish, dredge fiour over 
and put it on the rings ; put a pint of hot water in the 
pan, to baste with; bake one hour if a large fish, in a 
quick oven; baste frequently. When the fish is taken 
up, having cut a lemon in very thin slices, put them in 
the pan and let them try a little; then dredge in a tea- 
spoonful of wheat flour; add a small bit of butter; stir 
it about, and let it brown without burning for a little 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 81 

while, then add half a teacupful or more of boiling wa- 
ter, stir it smooth, take the slices of lemon into the gravy 
boat, and strain the gravy over. Serve with boiled pota- 
toes. The lemon may be omitted if preferred, although 
generally it will be liked 

SALMON-TROUT. 

Dressed the same as salmon 

SPICED SALMON (PICKLED). 

Boil a salmon, and after wiping it dry, set it to 
cool; take of the water in which it was boiled, and good 
vinegar each equal parts, enough to cover it; add to it 
one dozen cloves, as many small blades of mace, or sliced 
nutmeg, one teaspoonful of whole pepper, and the same 
of alspice; make it boiling hot, skim it clear, add a small 
bit of butter (the size of a small egg) and pour it over 
the fish; set it in a cool place. When cold it is fit foi 
use, and will keep for a long time, covered close in a p 
place. Serve instead of pickled oysters for supper. 

A fresh cod is very nice done in the same manner, 
as is also a striped sea bass. 

SALMON AND CAPER SAUCE. 

Two slices of salmon, one quarter pound butter, one 
half teaspoonful of .chopped parsley, one shalot; salt, 
pepper and grated nutmeg to taste. 

Mode : Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, place pieces 
of butter over it and add the other ingredients, rubbing 
a little of the seasoning into the fish ; baste it frequently; 
when done take it out and drain for a minute or two; 



32 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

lay it in a dish, pour caper sauce over it and «erve; sal 
mon dressed in this way, with tomato sauce, is very de 
licious. 

SALMON CUTLETS. 

Out tlie slices one inch thick and season them wit! 
pepper and salt; butter a sheet of white paper, lay eacl 
slice on a separate piece with their ends twisted; boi 
gently over a clear fire and serve with anchovy or capei 
sauce. When high seasoning is required, add a fev 
chopped herbs and a little spice. 

DRIED OR SMOKED SALMON. 

Cut the fish down the back, take out the entrails anc 
roe, scale it, and rub the outside and in with common salt 
and hang it to drain for twenty-four hours. 

Pound three ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of coarse 
alt and two of coarse brown sugar; mix these well to- 
gether and rub the salmon over every part with it, then 
lay it on a large dish for two days, then rub it over with 
common salt, and in twenty-four hours it will be fit to 
dry. Wipe it well, stretch it open with two sticks and 
hang it in a chimney, with a smothered wood fire, or a 
smoke-house, or in a dry, cool place. 

Shad done in this manner are very fine. 

BOILED COD. 

Lay the fish in cold water, a little salt, for half an 
hour. Wipe dry, and sew up in a linen cloth, coarse and 
clean fitted to the shape of the piece of cod. Have but 
one fold over each part. Lay in the fish kettle, cover 




VEGETABLES. 
The first consideration in the purchase o£ veeetables is to have ( 
gard to tho variations of taste anJappearancewEich the same veg 
undergo in different seasons. Spn rig carrots, (or instance, are vt 
lerentfrom those of Autumn andWmter.

with boiling water, salted at discretion. Allow nearly 
an hour for a piece weighing four pounds. 

COD PIE. 

Any remains of cold cod, twelve oysters, sufficient 
melted butter to moisten it; mashed potatoes enoagh to 
fill up the dish. 

Mode : Flake the fish from the bone, and caretully 
take away all the skin. Lay it in a pie-dish, pour over 
the melted butter and oysters (or oyster sauce, if there is 
any left), and cover with mashed potatoes. Bake for half 
an hour, and send to table of a nice brown color. 

DRIED CODFISH. 

This should always be laid in soak at least one night 
before it is wanted; then take off the skin and put it in 
plenty of cold water; boil it gently (skimming it mean- 
while) for one hour, or tie it in a cloth and boil it. 

Serve with egg sauce; garnish with hard-boiled eggs 
cut in slices, and sprigs of parsley. Serve plain boiled 
or mashed potatoes with it. 

STEWED SALT COD. 

Scald some soaked cod by putting it over the fire in 
boiling water for ten minutes; then scrape it white, pick 
it in flakes, and put it in a stew-pan, with a tablespoonful 
of butter worked into the same of flour, and as much 
milk as will moisten it ; let it stew gently for ten min- 
utes; add pepper to taste, and serve hot; put it in a deep 
dish, slice hard-boiled eggs over, and sprigs of parsley 

around the edge, 
a 



This is a nice relish for breakfast, witfi coffee and 
tea, and rolls or toast. 

CXJDFISH CAKES. 

First boil soaked cod, then ctiop it fine, put to it an 
equal quantity of potatoes boiled and mashed; naoisten 
it with beaten eggs or milk, and a bit of butter and a 
little pepper; form it in small, round cakes, rather more 
than a half inch thick; ilour the outside, and fry in hot 
lard or beef drippings until they are a delicate brown; 
like fish, these must be fried gently, the lard being boil- 
ing hot when they are put in ; when one side is done turn 
the other. Serve for breakfast. 

BOILED BASS. 

i*ut enough water in the pot for the fish to swim 
in, easily. Add half a cup of vinegar, a teaspoonful of 
salt, an onion, a dozen black peppers, and ablade of mace. 
Sew up the fish in a piece of clean net, fitted to its shape. 
Heat slowly for the first half hour, then boil eight min- 
utes, at least, to the pound, quite fast. Unwrap, and pour 
over it a cup of drawn butter, based upon the liquor in 
which the fish was boiled, with the juice of half a lemon 
stirred into it. Garnish with sliced lemon. 

FRIED BASS. 

Clean, wipe dry, inside and out, dredge with flour, 
and season with salt. Fry in hot butter, beef-dripping, 
or sweet lard. Half-butter, half -lard is a good mixture 
for ifyvn^ fish. The momen t the fish are done to a good 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 85 

brown take them from the fat and drain in a hot col- 
ander. Garnish with parsley. 

TO FRY OR BROIL FIH PROPERLY. 

After the iish is well cleansed, lay it on a folded 
towel a;id dry ont all the water; when well wiped and 
dry, roll it in wheat flour, rolled crackers, grated stale 
bread or Indian meal, whichever may be preferred; wheat 
flonr will generally be liked. 

Have a thick-bottomed frying-pan or spider wirli 
plenty of sweet l-ird salted (a tablespoontul of salt to eacii 
pound of lard) for fresh fish which have not been pre- 
viously salted; let it become boiling hot, then lay tlie 
fish in and let it fry gently until one side is a fine deli- 
cate brown, then turn the other; when both are done take- 
it up carefully and serve quickly, or keep it covered with 
a tin cover, and set the dish where it will keep hot. 

BAKED BLACK BASS. 

Eight good-sized onions chopped fine, half that quan- 
tity of bread crumbs, butter size of hen's egg, plenty of 
pepper and salt, mix thoroughly with anchovy sauce un- 
til quite red; stuff your fish with this compound and 
pour the rest over it, previously sprinkling it with a lit- 
tle red pepper. Shad, pickerel and trout are good the 
same way. Tomatoes can be used instead of anchovies, 
and are more economical. If using them, take pork in 
place of butter and chop fine. 

BROILED MACKEREL. 

J*epper and salt to taste, a small quantity of oil. 



Mackerel should never be washed when intended to be 
broiled, but merely wiped very clean and dry after taking 
out the gills and inside. Open the back, and put in 
a little pepper, salt, and oil ; broil it over a clear fire, 
turn it over on both sides, and also on the back. When 
sufficiently cooked, the flesh can be detached from the 
bone, which will be in about ten minutes for a small 
mackerel. Chop a little parsley, work it up in the but- 
ter, with pepper and salt to taste, and a squeeze of lemon 
juice, and put it in the back. Serve before the butter is 
quite melted. 

Mode : Scale and clean the pike, and fasten the tail 
in its mouth by means of a skewer. Lay it in cold water, 
and when it boils throw in the salt and vinegar. The 
time for boiling depends, of course, on the size of the 
fish; but a middling-sized pike will take about half an 
hour. Serve with Dutch or anchovy sauce, and plain 
melted butter. 

Mackerel baked will be found palatable. Clean and 
trim the fish nicely, say four large ones, or half a dozen 
small ones, bone them and lay neatly in a baking dish, 
or a bed of potato chips well dusted with a mixture of 
pepper and salt; on the potatoes place a few pieces of 
butter. Dust the fish separately with pepper and salt, 
and sprinkle slightly with a diluted mixture of a,nchovy 
sauce and catsup. Bake three-quarters of an hour. 

SALT MACKEREL WITH CREAM SAUCE. 

Soak over night in lukewarm water, changing this 
in the morning for ice-cold. Hub all the salt off, and 
wipe dry. Grease your gridiron with butter, and rub the 
fish on both sides with the same, melted- Then broil 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK 37 

quickly over a clear fire, turning with a cake-turner so as 
not to break it. Lay upon a hot water dish and cover 
until the sauce is ready. 

Heat a small cup of milk to scalding. Stir into it a 
teaspoonful of corn-starch wet up with a little water. 
When this thickens, add two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Eeat an egg light, 
pour the sauce gradually over it, put the mixture again 
over the fire, and stir one minute, not more. Pour upon 
the fish, and let all stand, covered, over the hot water in 
the chafing dish. Put fresh boiling water under the dish 
before sending to table. 

BOILED EELS, 

Four small eels, sufficient water to cover them; a 
large bunch of parsley. 

Choose small ells for boiling, put them on a stew- 
pan with the parsley, and just sufficient water to cover 
them; simmer till tender. Take them out, pour a little 
parsley and butter over them, and serve some in a 
tnrsen. 

FRICASSEED EELS. 

After skinning, cleaning, and cutting five or six eels 
in pieces of two inches in length, boil them in water nearly 
to cover them, until tender; then add a good-sized bit of 
butter, with a teaspoonful of wheat flour or rolled cracker, 
worked into it, and a little scalded and chopped parsley ; 
add salt and pepper to taste, and a wine-glass of vinegar 
if liked ; let them simmer for ten minutes and serve hot. 

FRIED EELS. 
After cleaning the eels well, cut them in pieees twp 



38 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

inches long; wash them ana wipe tbem ory; roll ther 
in wheat flour or rolled cracker, and fry as directed fo 
other fish, in hot lard or beef dripping, salted. The 
should be browned all over and thoroughly done. 

Eels may be prepared in the same manner an^ 
broiled. 

COLLARED EELS. 

One large eel, pepper and salt to taste; two blade 
of mace, two cloves, a little alspice very finely poundec 
six leaves of sage, and a small bunch of herbs mince 
very small. 

Mode : Bone the eel and skin it ; split it, and sprinkl 
it over witii che ingredients, taking care that the spice 
are very finely pounded, and the herbs chopped ver 
small. Roll it up and bind with a broad piece of tape 
and boil it in water, mixed with a little salt and vinegai 
till tender. It may either be served whole or cut i 
slices; and when cold, the eel should be kept in the lie 
uor it was boiled in but with a little more vinegar pr 
to it. 

FRIED TROUT. 

They must, of course, be nicely cleaned and trimme 
all round, but do not cut off their heads. Dredge thei 
well with flour, and fry in a pan of boiling hot fat or oi 
Turn them from side to side till they are nicely brownec 
and quite ready. Drain off all the fat before sending tl 
fish to table; garnish them with a few sprigs of parsle; 
and provide plain melted butter. If preferred, the troi 
can be larded with beaten egg, and be then dipped i 
bread crumb. The frying will occupy from five to eigl 



THE JJriBKYDAY COOK BOOK. 39 

minntes, according to size. Very large trout can be cut 
in pie. 

TROUT IN JELLY (or other Fish). 

This is a beautiful supper dish, and may be arranged 
as follows: Turn the fish into rings, with tail in mouth, 
prepare a seasoned water in which to boil the trout; the 
water should have a little vinegar and salt in it, and may 
be flavored with a shallot or clove or garlic. When the 
water is cold, place the trout in it, and boil them very 
gently, so as not to hash or break them. When done, 
lift out and drain. Baste with fish jelly, for which a 
recipe is given elsewhere, coat after coat, as each coat 
hardens. Arrange neatly and serve. 

BOILED TROUT. 

Let the water be thouroughly a-boil before you put 
in the fish. See that it is salt, and that a dash of vinegar 
has been put in it. Eemove all scum as it rises, and boil 
the fish till their eyes protrude. Lift them without 
breaking, drain off the liquor, and serve on a napkin if 
you like. To be eaten with a sauce according to taste^ 
that is, it it can be made of anchovies or shrimps. 

BROILED TROUT. 

Clean and split them open, season with a little salt 
and Cayenne; dip in whipped egg, dredge with iiour and 
brander over a clear fire. Serve with sauce. 

BAKED HADDOCK. 

Choose a nice fish of about six pounds, which tna 



40 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK.. 

and scrape nicely, gutting it carefully, fill the vacut 
with a stuffing of veal, chopped ham, and bread cruml 
sew up with strong thread, and shape the fish rouD 
putting its tail into its mouth, or, if two are required, 1 
them along the dish reversed — that is, tail to head; ri 
over with plenty of butter, or a batter of eggs and floi 
and then sprinkle with bread-crumbs. Let the oven 
pretty hot when put in. In about an hour the fish w 
be ready. Serve on the tin or aisset in which they ha 
been baked, placing them on a larger dish for that pu 
pose. Mussel sauce is a good accompaniment. 

CURRIED HADDOCK 

Curried Haddock is excellent. FiUet the fish ai 
curry it in a pint of beef stock slightly diluted wil 
water, and thickened with a tablespoonf ul of curry po^ 
der. Some cooks chop up an onion to place in the ste' 
it will take an hour to ready this fish. If preferred, fi 
the fish for a few minutes in clean lard oil before stewir 
it in the curry. 

RIZZARED HADDOCK. 

First, of course, procure your fish, clean them tho 
oughly, rub them well with salt, and let them lie for oi 
night, after which hang them in the open air to dry, in 
shady place. In two days they will be ready for tl 
gridiron. Before cooking them, take out the backboi 
and skin them, if desired (I never do skin them), bro 
till ready, eat with a little fresh Jsntter. 

Haddocks can be boiled with advantage; all that 
necessary is plenty of salt in the water, and not to sen 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK, 41 

them till they are well done. As a general rule, it may 
be ascertained when fish is sufficiently cooked by the 
readiness with which the flesh lifts frona the bone. Stick 
a fork into the shoulder of a cod or haddock and try it. 
If living sufficiently near the sea, procure sea water in 
which to boil your haddocks. 

BROILED WHITE-FISH-FRESH. 

Wash and drain the fish; sprinkle with pepper and 
lay with the inside down upon the gridiron, and broil 
over fresh, bright coals. When a nice brown, turn for a 
moment on the other side, then take up and spread with 
butter. This is a very nice way of broiling all kinds of 
fish, fresh or salted. A little smoke under the fish adds 
to its flavor. This may be made by putting two or three 
cobs under the gridiron. 

BAKED WHITE-FISH. 

Fill the fish with a stuffing of fine bread-crumbs 
and a little butter; sew up the fish; sprinkle with butter, 
pepper and salt. Dredge with flour and bake one hour, 
basting often and serving with parsley sauce or egg sauce. 

TO CHOOSE LOBSTERS. 

These are chosen more by weight than size; the 
heaviest are best; a good, small-sized one will not unfre- 
quently be found to weigh as heavily as one much larger. 
If fresh, a lobster will be lively and the claws have a 
strong motion when the eyes are pressed with the- finger. 

The male is best for boiling; the flesh is firmer, and 
the shell a brighter red; it may be readily distinguished 



42 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

from the female; the tail is narrower, and the two ii 
permost fins within the tail are stiff and hard. Those 
the hen lobster are not so, and the tail is broader. 

Hen lobsters are preferred for sauce or salad, on i 
count of their coral. The head and small claws s 
never used. 

BOILED LOBSTER. 

These crustaceans are usually sold ready-boih 
When served, crack the claws and cut open the body, i; 
neatly on a napkin-covered dish, and- garnish with 
few sprigs of parsley. Lobster so served is usually eat 
cold. 

CURRIED LOBSTER. 

Pick out the meat of two red lobsters from the she 
into a shallow sauce-pan, in the bottom of which has be 
placed a thin slice of tasty ham, with a little Cayen 
pepper and a teaspoonful of salt. Mix up half a cup! 
of white soup and half a cupful of cream and pour ov 
the meat. Put it on the fire and let it simmer for abo 
an hour, when you will add a dessert-spoonful of cun 
and another of flour rubbed smooth in a little of the li 
uor taken out of the pot; in three minutes the curry w 
be ready to dish. Some add a dash of lemon to tl 
curry (I don't), and the cream can be dispensed with 
necessary. Put a rim of well-boiled rice round the di 
if you like, or serve the rice separately. 

LOBSTER CHOWDER. 
Four or five pounds of lobster, chopped fine; ta 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 43 

the green part and add to it four pounded crackefs; stir 
this into one quart of boiling milk; then add the lobster, 
a piece of butter one-halt the size of an egg, a little pep- 
per and salt, and bring it to a boil. 

CHOWDER. 

Cut some slices of pork very thin, and fry them out 
dry in the dinner-pot; then put in a layer of fish cut in 
slices on the pork, then a layer of onions, and then po- 
tatoes, all cut in exceedingly thin slices ; then fish, onions, 
potatoes again, till your materials are all in, putting some 
salt and pepper on each layer of onions; split some hard 
biscuits, dip them in water, and put them round the sides 
and over the top; put in water enough to come up in 
sight; stew lor over halt an hour, till the potatoes are 
done; add half a pint of milk, or a teacup of sweet cream, 
five minutes before you take it up 

TO FRY SMELTS. 

Egg and bread-crumbs, a little ffour, boiling lard. 
Smelts should be very fresh, and not washed more than 
is necessary to clean them. Dry them in a cloth, lightly 
flour, dip them in egg, and sprinkle over with very fine 
bread-crumbs, and put them into boiling lard. Fry of a

roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be spoiled. 
Dry them before the fire on a drainer, and serve with 
plain melted butter.

butter, two blades of pounded mace; salt and Cayeni 
to taste. "Wash, and dry the fish thoroughly in a clot 
and arrange them nicely in a flat bakiag dish. Gov 
them with fine bread-crumbs, and place little pieces ^ 
butter all over them. Season and bake for fifteen mi: 
ntes. But before serving, add a squeeze of lemon-juic 
and garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon, 

RED HERRINGS or YARMOUTH BLOATER! 

The best way to cook these is to make incisions i 
the skin across the fish, because they do not then requii 
to be so long on the fire, and will be far better than whe 
cut open. The hard roe makes a nice relish by pounc 
ing it in a mortar, with a little anchovy, and spreading : 
on toast. 

If very dry, soak in warm water, one hour befor 
dressing. 

POTTED FISH. 

Take out the backbone of the fish; for one weighin 
two pounds take a tablespoonful of alspice and clove 
mixed; these spices should be put into little bags of no 
too thick muslin ; put sufficient salt directly upon ead 
fish; then roll in a cloth, over which sprinkle a littl 
Cayenne pepper; put alternate layers of fish, spice an( 
sago in an earthen jar; cover with the best cider vinegar 
cover the jar closely with a plate and over this put a cov 
ering of dough, rolled out to twice the thickness of pii 
crust. Make the edges of paste, to adhere closely to th< 
sides of the jar, so as to make it air-tight. Put the ja

into a pot of cold water and let it boil from three to five 
hours, according to quantity. Eeady when cold. 

OYSTERS ON THE SHELL. 

Wash the shells and put them on hot Coals or upon 
the top of a hot stove, or bake them in a hot oven; open 
the shells with an oyster-knife, taking care to lose none 
of the liquor, and serve quickly on hot plates, with toast. 
Oysters may be steamed in the shells, and are excellent 
eaten in the same manner. 

OYSTERS STEWED WITH MILK. 

Take a pint of fine oysters, put them with their own 
liquor, and a giU of milk into a stew-pan,. and if liked, a 
blade of mace, set it over the fire, take off any scum 
which may rise; when they are plump and white turn 
them into a deep plate; add a bit of butter, and pepper 
to taste. Serve crackers and dressed celery with them. 
Oysters may be stewed in their own liquor without 
milk. 



OYSTERS FRIED IN BATTER. 



I 



Half a pint of oysters, two eggs, half pint of milk, 
sufficient flonr to make the batter; pepper and salt to 
taste; when liked, a little nutmeg; hot lard. Scald the 
oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and lay them on 
a cloth, to drain thoroughly. Break the eggs into a 
basin, mix the flour with them, add the milk gradually, 
with nutmeg and seasoning, and put the oysters in a bat- 
ter. Make some lard hot in a deep frying-pan, p-ut in 
the oysters, one at a time; when done, take them i?^ with

melted, dredge ia sufBcient flour to dry it up; add th 
stock, cream and strained liquor, and give one boil. Pu 
in the oysters and seasoning; let them gradually hea 
through, but not boil. Have ready the scallop-shell 
buttered ; lay in the oysters, and as much of the liquii 
as they will hold ; cover them over with bread-crumbs 
over which drop a little oiled butter. Brown them in th 
oven, or before the fire, and serve quickly, and very ho1 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Take large oysters from their own liquor on to 
thickly folded napkin to dry them off; then make ; 
tablespoonful of lard or beef fat hot, in a thick-bottome( 
frying-pan, add to it half a saltspoonful of salt; dip eacl 
oyster in wheat flour, or cracker rolled fine, until it wil 
take up no more, then lay them in the pan, hold it over i 
gentle fire until one side is a delicate brown; turn th 
other by sliding a fork under it; five minutes will fr 
them after they are in the pan. Oysters may be fried ii

the oyster liquid poured in the pan after the oysters are 
done; let it boil up, then put it in the dish with the oys- 
ters; "when wanted for breakfast, this should be done. 

Oysters to be fried, after drying as directed, may be 
dipped into beaten egg first, then into rolled cracker. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Make some rich puff paste and bake it in very small 
tin patty pans; when cool, turn them out upon a large 
dish ; stew some large fresh oysters with a few cloves, a 
little mace and nutmeg; then add the yolk of one egg, 
boiled hard and grated; add a little butter, and as much 
of the oyster liquid as will cover them. When they have 
stewed a little while, take them out of the pan and set 
them to cool. When quite cold, lay two or three oysters 
in each shell of puff paste. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

Drain the oysters well and dry them with a napkin. 
Have ready a griddle hot and well buttered; season the 
oysters; lay them to griddle and brown them on both 
sides. Serve them on a hot plate with plenty of butter. 

CLAM FRITTERS. 

Take fifty small or twenty-five large sand clams from 
their shells; if large, cut each in two, lay them on a 
thickly folded napin; put a pint bowl oi wheat flour into 
a basin, add to it two well-beaten eggs, half a pint of . 
sweet milk, and nearly as much of their own liquor; beat 
the batter until it is smooth and perfectly free from 
lamps; then stir in the clams. Eut plenty of lard or

beef fat into a thick-bottomed frying pan, let it becom 
boiling hot; put in the batter by the spoonful; let thei 
fry gently; when one side is a delicate brown, turn tt 
other. 

SOFT-SHELLED CLAMS. 

Those are very fine if properly prepared. They ar 
good only during cold weather and must be perfectl 
fresh. 

Soft-shelled clams may be boiled from the shelli 
and served with butter, pepper and salt over. 

TO BOIL SOFT-SHELL CLAMS. 

Wash the shells clean, and put the clams, the edge 
downwards, in a kettle; then pour about a quart of boil 
ing water over them ; cover the pot and set it over a bris] 
fire for three-quarters of an hour; pouring boiling wate 
on them causes the shells to open quickly and let out th 
sand which may be in them. 

Take thefli up when done, take off the black skii 
which covers the hard part, trim them clean, and pn 
them into a stew-pan ; put to them some of the liquor ii 
which they were boiled; put to it a good bit of butte 
and pepper and salt to taste: make them hot; serve witl 
cold butter and rolls. 

CLAM CHOWDER. 

Butter a deep tin basin, strew it thickly with grate( 
bread-crumbs or soaked crackers ; sprinkle some peppe 
over and bits of butter the size of a hickory nut, and, i 
liked, some finely chopped parsley; then put a doubl( 



THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. 49 

layer of clams, season with pepper, put bits of butter over, 
thea another layer of soaked crackers; after that clams 
andbits of butter; sprinkle pepper over; add a cup of 
milk or water, and lastly a layer of soaked crackers. Turn 
a plate over the basin, and bake in a hot oven for three- 
quarters of an hour; use half a pound of soda biscuit, 
and a quarter of a pound of butter with fifty clams. 



50 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 



MEATS. 



ROAST BEEF. 

Prepare for the oven by dredging lightly with Uanr, 
and seasoning with salt and pepper; place in the oven, 
and baste frequently while roasting. ^ Allow a quarter of 
an hour for a pound of meat, if you like it rare; longer 
if you like it well done. Serve with a sauce made frorc. 
the drippings in the pan, to which has been added a ta- 
blespoon of Harvey or "Worcestershire sauce, and a table- 
spoon of tomato catsup. 

ROUND OF BEEF BOILED. 

See that it is not too large, and that it is tightly 
bound all round. About twelve pounds or fourteen 
pounds form a convenient size, and a joint of that weight 
w'll require from three hours to three hours and a quar- 
ter to boil. Put on with cold water — as the liquor is val- 
uable for making pea-soup — and let it come slowly to the 
boil. Boil carefully but not rapidly and skim frequently; 
as a rule, keep the lid of the pot well fixed. The meat 
may be all the better if taken out once or twice in the 
process of cooking. Carrots and turnips may be boiled 



THEEVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 61 

to serve with the round; they will, of course, cook in 
abont a third of the time necessary to boil the beef. 

BEEF SALTED, OB CORNED, RED. 

To Keep fop Years. 

Cut up a quarter of beef. For each hundred weight 
take half a peck of coarse salt, quarter of a pound of salt- 
petre, the same weight of salaratus, and a quart of mo- 
lasses, or two pounds of coarse brown sugar. Mace, cloves 
and alspice may be added for spiced beef. 

Strew some of the salt in the bottom of a pickle-tub or 
barrel ; then put in a layer of meat, strew this with salt, 
then add another layer of meat, and salt and meat alter- 
nately until all is used. Let it remain one night. Dis- 
solve the salaratus and saltpetre in a little warm water, 
and put it to the molasses or sugar; then put it over the 
meat, add water enough'to cover the meat, lay a board on 
it to keep it under the brine. The meat is fit for use 
after ten days. This receipt is for winter beef. Eather 
more salt may be used in warm weather. 

Towards spring take the brine from the meat, make 
it boiling hot, skim it clear, and when it is cooled return 
it to the meat. 

Beef tongues and smoking pieces are fine pickled in 
this brine. Beef liver put in thi^ brine for ten days and 
then wipe dry and smoked, is very fine. Cut it in slices, 
and fry or broil it. The brisket of beef, after being 
ccmedj may be smoked, and is very fine for boiling. 

Lean pieces of beef, cut properly from the hind quar- 
ter, are the proper pieces for being smoked. There may 
be some fine pieces cut from the fore-quarter. 



52 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

After the beef has been in brine ten daya^or more, 
wipe it dry and hang it in a chimney where wood is 
burnt, or make a smothered fire of sawdust or chips, and 
keep it smoking for ten days; then rub fine black pepper 
over every part, to keep the flies from it, and hang it in 
a dry, dark, cool place. After a week it is fit for use. A 
strong, coarse brown paper folded around beef and 
fastened with paste, keeps it nicely. 

Tongues are smoked in the same manner. Hang 
them by a string put through the root end. Spiced brine 
for smoked beef or tongues will be generally liked. 

For convenience, make a pickle as mentioned for 
beef, keep it in the cellar ready for pickling beef at any 
time. Beef may remain in three or four or more days. 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF. 

Put the beef in water enough to cover it, and let 
it heat slowly, and boil slowly, and be careful to take off 
the greace. Many think it much improved by boiling 
potatoes, turnips and cabbage with it. In this case the 
vegetables must be peeled, and all the grease carefully 
skimmed as fast as it rises. Allow about twenty min • 
utes of boiling for each pound of meat. 

A NICE WAT TO SERVE COLD BEEF. 

Cut cold roast beef in slices, put gravy enough to 
cover them, and a wineglass of catsup or wine, or a 
lemon sliced thin; if you have not gravy, put hot water 
and a good bit of butter, with a teaspoonf ul or more of 
browned flour; put it in a closely covered stew-pan and 
let it simmer gently for half an hour. If you choose, when 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 53 

the meat is down, cut a leek in thin slices, and chop a 
bunch of parsley small, and add it; serve boiled or 
mashed potatoes with it. This is equal to beef-arla- 
mode. 

Or, cold beef may be served cut in neat slices, gar- 
nished with sprigs of parsley, and made mustard, and 
tomato catsup in the castor; serve mashed, if not new 
potatoes, with it, and ripe fruit, or pie, or both, for des- 
sert, for a small family dinner. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Four pounds of round of beef chopped fine; take 
from it all fat; add to it three dozen small crackers rolled 
fine, four eggs, one cup of milk, one tablespoon ground 
mace, two tablespoons of black pepper, one tablespoon 
melted butter; mix well and put in any tin pan that it 
will just fill, packing it well ; baste with butter and water, 
and bake two hours in a slow oven. 

BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

Lay a thick tender steak upon a gridiron over hot 
coals, having greased the bars with butter before the 
steak has been put upon it (a steel~ gridiron with slender 
bars is to be preferred, the broad flat iron bars of grid- 
irons commonly used fry and scorch the meat, imparting 
a disagreeable flavor.) When done on one side, .have 
ready your platter warmed, with a little butter on it; lay 
the steak upon the platter with the cooked side down, 
that the juices which have gathered may run on the plat- 
ter, but do not press the meat; then lay your beefsteak 
again upon the gridiron quickly and cook the other side. 



54 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK 

When done to your liking, put again on the platter, 
spread lightly with butter, place where it will keep warm 
for a few moments, but not to let the butter become oily 
(over boiling steam is. best); and then serve on hot plates. 
Beefsteak should never be seasoned with salt and pepper 
while cooking. If your meat is tough, pound well with 
» steak mallet on both sides. 

FRIED-eEEFSTEAK. 

Out some of the fat from the steak, and put it in a 
frying pan and set it over the fire; if the steaks are not 
very tender, beat them with a rolling pin, and when the 
fat is boiling hot, put the steak evenly in, cover the pan 
and let it fry briskly until one side is done, sprinkle a 
little pepper and salt over, and turn the other; let it be 
rare or well done as maybe liked; take the steak on a hot 
dish, add a wineglass or less of boiling water or catsup 
to the gravy; let it boil up once, and pour it in the dish 
with the steak. 

BEEFSTEAK PIE. 

Take some fine tender steaks, beat them a little, sea- 
son with a saltspoonful of pepper and a teaspoonful of 
salt to a two-pound steak; put bits of butter, the size of 
a hickory nut, over the whole surface, dredge a teaspoon- 
ful of flour over, then roll it up and cut it in pieces two 
inches long; put a rick pie paste around the sides and 
bottom of a tin basin ; put in the pieces of steak, nearly 
fill the basin with water, add a piece of butter the sjze of 
a large egg, cut small, dredge in a teaspoonful of flour, 
add a little pepper and salt, lay skewers across the basin. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 55 

1 a top crust to half an inch thickness, cut a slit in the 
alter; dip your fingers in flour and neatly pinch the top 
nd side crust together all around the edge. Bake one 
aour in a quick oven. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON. 

Mutton, water, salt. A leg of mutton for boiling 
should not hang too long, as it will not look a good color 
when dressed. Cut off the shank-bone, trim the knuckle 
and wash and wipe it very clean; plunge it into sufficient 
boiling water to cover it; let it boil up, then draw the 
saucepan- to the side of the fire, where it should remain 
till the finger can be borne in the water. Then place it 
■sufficiently near the fire, that the water may gently sim- 
mer, and be very careful tha,t it does not boil fast, or the 
meat will be hard. Skim well^ add a little salt, and in 
about two and one-quarter hours after the water begins 
to simmer, a moderate-sized leg of mutton will be done. 
Serve with carrots and mashed turnips, which may be 
boiled with the naeat, and.send caper sauce to table with 
it in a tureen. 

ROAST LOIN OF MUTTON. 

Loin of mutton, a little salt. Cut and trim off the 
superfluous fat, and see that the butcher joints the meat 
properly, as thereby much annoyance is saved to the 
carver, when it comes to table. Have ready a nice clear 
fire (it need not be a very wide, large one), put down the 
meat, dredge with flour, and baste well until it is done. 

BROILED MUTTON CHOPS. 
Loin of mntton, pepper and salt, a small piece of 



56 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

butter. Cut the chops from a well-hung, tender loin of 
mutton, remove a portion of the fat, and trim them into 
a nice shape; slightly beat and level them; place the 
gridiron over a bright, clear fire, rub the bars with a little 
fat, and lay on the chops. While broiling, frequenily 
turn them, and in about eight minutes they will be done. 
Season with pepper and salt, dish them on a very hot 
dish, rub a small piece of butter on each chop, and serve 
very hot and expeditiously. 

MUTTON CHOP FRIED. 

Out some fine mutton chops without much fat, rub 
over both sides with a mixture of salt and pepper, dip 
them in wheat flour or rolled crackers, and fry in hot lard 
or beef drippings; when both sides are a fine brown, take 
them on a hot dish, put a wineglass of hot water in the 
pan, let it become hot, stir in a teaspoonful of browned 
flour, let it boil up at once, and serve in the pan with the 
meat. 

ROAST FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB. 

Lamb, a little salt. To obtain the flavor of lamb in 
perfection it should not be long kept; time to cool is all 
that is required ; and though the meat may be somewhat 
thready, the juices and flavor will be infinitely superior 
to that of lamb that has been killed two or three days. 
Make up the fire in good time, that it may be clear and 
brisk when the joint is put down. Place it at sufficient 
distance to prevent the fat from burning, and baste it 
constantly till the moment of serving. Lamb should be 
very thoroughly done without being dried up, and not 



THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK 87 

the slightest appearance of red gravy should be visible, 
as in roast mutton; this rule is applicable to all young 
white meats. Serve with a little gravy made in the drip- 
ping-pan, the same as for other roasts, and send to table 
with a tureen of mint sauce. 

LAMB SWEETBREADS. 

Two or three sweetbreads, one-half pint of veal 
stock, white pepper and salt to taste, a small bunch. of 
green onions, one blade of pounded mace, thickening of 
butter and flour, two eggs, nearly one-half pint of cream, 
one teaspoonf al of minced parsley, a very little grated 
nutmeg. ' 

Mode: Soak the sweetbreads in lukewarm water, 
and put them into a saucepan with sufiicient boiling 
water to cover them, and let them simmer for ten min- 
utes; then take them out and put them into cold water. 
Now lard them, lay them in a stewpan, add the stock, 
seasoning, onions, mace, and a thickening of butter and 
flour, and stew gently for one-quarter of an hour or 
twenty minutes. Beat up the egg with the cream, to 
which add the minced parsley and very little grated nut- 
meg. Put this to the other ingredients; stir it well till 
quite hot, but do not let it boil after the cream is added 
or it will curdle. Have ready some asparagus tops, 
boiled ; add these to the sweetbreads, and serve. 

Lamb Steak dipped in egg, and then in biscuit or 
breadcrumbs, and fried until it is brown, helps to ^ake 
variety for the breakfafit table. With baked sweet pota- 
toes, good coffee, and buttered toast or com muffins, one 
may begin the day with courage. 

TO ROAST VEAL. 
Bioee the meat in cold water; if any part is bloody, 



58 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 

wash it off; make a mixture of pepper and salt, . 
ing a large teaspoonf ul of salt and a saltspoonful of pep" 
per for each pound of meat; wipe the meat dry: t^^Zil 
rub the seasoning into every part, shape it neat\~j v:ri*. 
fasten it with skewers, and put it on a spit, or &3t it cii 
a trivet or muffin rings, in a pan; stick bits o£ butter 
over the whole upper surface; dredge a little flfor over, 
put a pint of water in the pan to baste with, an '3 roast i£ 
before the fire in a Dutch oven or reflector, or put it in- 
to a hot oven ; baste it occasionally, turn it if iiecessary 
that every part may be done; if the water '.?astes add 
more, that the gravy may not bum ; allow /iftsen min. 
utes for each pound of meat; a piece weig' dug four or 
five pounds will then require one hour, or ■c> fecsjir JHli 
a quarter. 

VEAL CHOPS. 

Cut veal chops about an inch thick ; beat them flat 
with a rolling pin, put them in a pan, pour boiling 
water over them, and set them over the fire for five 
minutes; then take them up and wipe them dry; mix a 
tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonf ul of pepper for 
each pound of meat; rub each chop over with this, then 
dip them, first into beaten egg, then into rolled crackers 
as much as they will take up; then finish by frying in 
hot lard or beef drippings ; or broil them. For the broil 
have some sweet butter on a steak dish ; broil the chops 
until well done, over a bright clear fire of coals; (let 
them do gently that they may be well done,) then take 
them on to the butter, turn them carefully once or twice 
in it, and serve. Or dip the chops into a batter made 
of Qm egg be9.ten with Mi a teacup qf pjiy? ^xH as 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK 69 

much wheat flour as may be necessary. Or simply dip 
the chops without parboiling into wheat flour; make 
some lard or beef fat hot in a frying-pan; lay the chops 
in and when one side is a fine delicate brown, turn the 
other. When all are done, take them up, put a very lit- 
tle hot water into the pan, then put it in the dish with 
the chops. 

Or make a flour gravy thus: After frying them as 
last directed, add a tablespoonful more of fat to that in 
the pan, let it become boiling hot; make a thin batter of 
a small tablespoonful of wheat flour and cold water; add 
a little more salt and pepper to the gravy, then gradu- 
ally stir in the batter; stir it until it is cooked and a nice 
brown; then put it over the meat, or in a dish with it if 
it is thicker than is liked, add a little boiling water. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

Two or three pounds of veal cutlets, egg and bread- 
crumbs, two tablespoonf uls of minced savory herbs, salt 
and pepper to taste, a little grated nutmeg. 

Cut the cutlets about three-quarters ot an inch in 
thickness, flatten them, and brush them over with the 
yolk of an egg; dip them into bread-crumbs and minced 
herbs, season with pepper and salt and grated nutmeg, 
and fold each cutlet in a piece of buttered paper. Broil 
them, and send them to the table with melted butter or 
a good gravy. 

STUFFED FILLET OF VEAL WITH BACON. 

Take out the bone from the meat, and pin into a 
YoxJ^nd with gkewers. Bind securely with soft tapes. 



60 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

Fill the cavity left by the bone with a force-meat ot 
crumbs, chopped pork, thyme, and parsley, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, nutmeg and a pinch of lemon peel. 
Cover the top of the fillet with thin slices of cold cooked, 
fat bacon or salt pork, tying them in place with twines 
crossing the meat in all directions. Put into a pot with 
two cups of boiling water, and cook slowly and steadily 
two hours. Then take from the pot and put into a drip- 
ping-pan. Undo the strings and tapes. Brush the meat 
all over with raw egg, sift rolled cracker thickly over it, 
and set in the oven tor half an hour, basting often with 
gravy from the pot. When it is well browned, lay upon 
a hot dish with the pork about it. Strain and thicken 
the gravy and serve in a boat. 

If your fillet be large, cook twice as long in the pot. 
The time given above is for one weighing five pounds. 

VEAL CAKE (a convenient dish for a picnic.) 

A few slices of cold roast veal, a few slices of cold 
ham, two hard boiled eggs, two tablespoonfuls of minced 
parsley, a little pepper, good gravy, or stock No. 109. 

Out off all the brown outside from the veal, and cut 
the eggs into slices. Procure a pretty mold; lay veal, 
ham, eggs, and parsley in layers, with a little pepper be- 
tween each, and when the mold is full, get some strong 
stock, and fill up the shape. Bake for one hall-hour, and 
when cold, turn it out. 

VEAL PIE. 

Cut a breast of veal small, and put it in a stewpan, 
■with hot water to cover it; add to it a tablespoonful of 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 6\ 

salt, and set it over the fire; take off the scum as it rises; 
when the meat is tender, ti^rn it into a dish to cool ; take 
out all the small bones, butter a tin or earthern basin or 
pudding-pan, line it with a pie paste, lay some of the 
parboiled meat in to half fill it; put bits of butter, the 
size of a hickory nut, all over the meat; shake pepper 
over, dredge wheat flour over until it looks white; then 
fill it nearly to the top witTi some of the water in which 
the meat was boiled; roll a cover for the top of the crust, 
puff paste it, giving it two' or three turns, and roll it to 
nearly half an inch thickness ; cut a slit in the center, 
and make several small incisions on either side of it; lay 
some skewers across the pie, put the crust on, trim the 
edges neatly with a knife; bake one hour in a quick 
oven. A breast of veal will make two* two-quart basin 
pies; half a pound of nice, corned pork, cut in thin slices 
and parboiled with the meat, will make it very nice, and 
very little, if any butter, will be required for the pie; 
when pork is used, no other salt will be necessary. 

I 

BOILED CALF HEAD (without the skin). 

Gait's head, water, a little salt, four tablespoontuls oi 
melted butter, one taUlespoonful of minced parsley, pep- 
per and salt to taste, one tablespoonful of lemon-juice. 

After the head has been thproughly cleaned, and the 
brains removed, soak it in warm water to blanch it. Lay 
the brains also into warm water to soak, and let them 
remain for abont an hour. Put the head into a stewpan, 
with sufficient cold water to cover it, and when it boils, 
add a little salt; take off every particle of scum as it rises, 
and boil the head until perfectly tender. Boil the braina, 



62 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

chop them, and mix with them melted butter, minced 
parsley, pepper, salt and lemon-juice in the above pro- 
portion. Take up the head, skin the tongue and put it 
on a small dish with the brains round it. Have ready 
some parsley and butter, smother the head with it, and 
the remainder send to table in a tureen. Bacon, ham, 
pickled pork or pig's cheek are indispensable with calf's 
head. The brains are sometimes chopped with hard- 
boiled eggs. 

CALF'S HEAD CHEESE. 

Boil a calf's head in water enough to cover it, until 
the meat leaves the bones, then take it with a skimmer 
into a wooden bowl or tray; take from it every particle 
of bone; chop it small; season with pepper and salt; a 
heaping tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonf ul of pep- 
per will be sufficient; if liked, add a tablespoonful of 
finely chopped sweet herbs ; lay a cloth in a colander, put 
the minced meat into it, then fold the cloth closely over 
it, lay a plate over, and on it a gentle weight. When 
cold it may be sliced thin for supper or sandwiches. 
Spread each slice with made mustard. 

BOILED CALF'S FEET and PARSLEY 
BUTTER. 

Two calf's feet, two slices of bacon, two ounces of 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, salt and whole 
pepper to taste, one onion, a bunch of savory herbs, four 
cloves, one blade of mt ce, water, parsley and butter. 

Procure two white calf's feet; bone them as far as 
the first joint, and put them into warm water to soak iof 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 61 

two honrs. Then pat the bacon, butter, lemon-juice, 
onion, herbs, spices and seasoning into a stewpan ; lay in 
the feet and pour in just sufficient water to cover the 
whole; stew gently for about three hours; take out the 
feet, dish them and cover with parsley and butter. 

The liquor they were boiled in should be strained 
and put by in a clean basin for use; it will be found very 
good as an addition to gravies, etc., etc. 

CALF'S LIVER AND BACON. 

Two or three pounds of Uver, bacon, pepper and salt 
to taste, a small piece of butter, flour, two tablespoonf uls 
of lemon-juice, one-quaiter pint of water. 

Cut the liver in thin slices, and cut as many slices of 
bacon as there are of liver; fry the bacon first, then put 
that on a hot dish before the fire. Fry the liver in the 
fat which comes from the bapon, after seasoning it with 
pepper and salt and dredging over it a very little fiour. 
Turn the liver occasionally to prevent its burning, and 
when done lay it round the dish with a piece of bacon 
between each. Pour away the bacon fat, put in a small 
piece of butter, dredge in a little flour, add the lemon- 
juice and water, give one boil, and pour it in the middle 
of the dish. 

SWEETBREADS. 

Three sweetbreads, egg, and bread-crumbs, oiled but- 
ter, three slices of toast, brown gravy. 

Choose large white sweetbreads; put them into warm 
water to draw out the blood and to improve the color; 
let them remain for rather more than one Jjour; then put 



M THE EVEEYPASr COOK BOOK. 

them into boiling water and allow them to simmer for 
about ten minutes, which renders them firm. Take them 
np, drain them, brush over the egg, sprinkle with bread- 
crumbs; dip them in egg again and then into more bread- 
crumbs. Drop on them a little oiled butter, and put the 
sweetbreads into a moderately heated oven and let them 
bake for nearly three-quarters of an honr. Make three 
pieces of toast; place the sweetbreads on the toast and 
pour round, but not over them, a good brown gravy. 

EGG-ED VEAL HASH. 

Chop fine remnants of cold roast veal. Moisten 
with the gravy or water. "WTjoji hot, break into it three 
or lour eggs, according to the quantity of veal. When 
the eggs are cooked stir into it a spoonful of butter and 
serve quickly. It to your taste, shake in a little parsley. 
Should you lack quantity, half a cup of fine stale bread- 
crumbs are no disadvantage. 

ROAST BEEF WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Have your meat ready for roasting on Saturday, al- 
ways. Roast itpon a grating of several clean sticks (not 
pine) laid over the dripping-pan. Dash a cup of boiling 
water over the beef when it goes into the oven; baste 
often, and see that the fat does not scorch. About three- 
qaarters of an hour before it is done, mix the pudding. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

One pint of milk, four eggs, whites and yolks beaten 
separately, two cups of flour (prepared flour is best), one 
tBBspootdxdotaalt. 



THB Ey£BYDAT COOK BOOK. 01 

Use less flour if the batter grows too stiff. Mix 
quickly; pour off the fat from the top of the gravy in 
the dripping-pan leaving just enough to prevent the pud- 
ding from sticking to the bottom. Pour in the batter 
and continue to roast the beef, letting the dripping fall 
upon the pudding below. The oven should be brisk by 
this time. Baste the meat with the gravy you have taken 
out to make room for the batter. In serving, cut the 
pudding into squares and lay about the meat in tbediah. 
It is very delicious. 

BEEF HEART BAKED OR ROASTEB. 

Cut a beef heart in two, take out the strings from 
the inside, wash it with warm water, rub the inside with 
pepper and salt and fill it with a etufSng made of bread 
and butter moistened with water and seasoned with pep- 
per and salt, and, if liked, a sprig of thyme made fine; 
put it together and tie a string around it, rub the outside 
with pepper and salt, stick bits of butter on, then dredge 
flour over and set it on a trivet, or muflln rings, in a 
dripping-pan ; put a pint of water m to baste with, then 
roast it before a hot fire or in a hot oven ; turn it aionnd 
and baste frequently. One hour will roast or bake it; 
when done take it up, cut a lemon in thick slices and put 
it in ^he pan with a bit of butter dredged in a teaspoon- 
f ul of flour; let it brown ; add a small teacup of boiling 
water, stir it smooth and serve in a gravy tureen. 

BEEF KIDNEY 

Out the kidney into thin slices, flonr them and try 
of a nice brown. When ~ done make a gravy in the pan 



by pouring away the fat, putting in a small piece of but- 
ter, one-quarter pint of boiling water, pepper and salt 
and a tablespoonful of mushroon catsup. Let the gravy 
just boil up, pour over the kidney and serve. 

POTTED BEEF. 

Two pounds of lean beef, one tablespoonful of water, 
one-quarter pound of butter, a seasoning to taste of salt, 
Cayenne, pounded mace and black pepper. Procure a 
nice piece of lean beef, as free as possible from gristle, 
skin, etc., and put it into a jar (if at hand, one with a 
lid) with one teaspoonful of water. Cover it closely, and 
put the jar into a saiicepan of boiling water, letting the 
water come within two inches of the top of the jar. Boil 
gently for three and a half hours, then take the beef, 
chop it very small with a chopping-knife, and pound it 
thoroughly in a mortar. Mix with it by degrees all or a 
portion of the gravy that will have run from it, and a 
little clarified butter; add the seasoning, put it in small 
pots for use, and cover with a little butter just warmed 
and pour over. If much gravy is added to it, it will 
keep but a short time ; on the contrary, if a large propor- 
tion of butter is used it may be preserved for some time. 

BOILED TONGUE. 

One tongue, a bunch of savory herbs, water. In 
choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it has been dried 
or pickled, and select one with a smooth skin, which de- 
notes its being young and tender. If a dried one, and 
rather hard, soak it at least twelve hours previous to 
cooking it; if, however, it is fresh from the pickle, two 



THE EVEETDAT COOK BOOK. 67 

or three hours will be sufficient for it to remain in soak. 
Put the tongue into a stewpan with plenty of cold water 
and a bunch of savory herbs; let it gradually come to a 
boil, skim well, and simmer very gently until tender. 
Peel off the skin, garnish with tufts of culiflowers or 
Brussels sprouts, and serve. Boiled tongue is frequently 
sent to table with boiled poultry instead of ham, and is, 
by many persons, preferred. If to serve cold, peel it, 
fasten it down to a piece of buard by sticking a fork 
through the root and another through the top to straight- 
en it. "Wlien cold, glaze it and put a paper ruche round 
the root and garnish with tufts of parsley. 

FRICASSEED TRIPE. 

Cut a pound of tripe in narrow strips, put a small 
cup of water or milk to it, add a bit of butter the size of 
an egg, dredged in a large teaspoonful of flour, or work 
it with the butter; season with pepper and salt, let it 
simmer gently for half an hour; serve hot. A bunch of 
parsley cut small and put with it, is an improvement. 

BROILED TRIPE. 

Prepare tripe as for frying; lay it on a gridiron over 
a clear fire of coals; let it boil gently; when one side is a 
fine brown, turn the other side (it must be nearly done 
through before turning); take it up on a hot dish, butter 
it, and, if liked, add a little catsup or vinegar to the gravy. 

BOAST RABBIT. 

Empty, skin, and thoroughly wash the rabbit; wipe 
it dry; li'ie the iaside with sausage-meat and force-meat 



68 THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. 

(the latter of bread-crumbs, well seasoned and worked 
up). Sew the stuffing inside, skewer back the head be- 
tween the shoulders, cut oH the fore joints of the shoul- 
ders and legs, bring them close to the body, and secure 
them by means of a skewer. "Wrap the rabbit in buttered 
paper, keep it well basted, and a few minutes before it is 
done remove the paper, flour and froth it and let it ac- 
quire a nice brown color. It should be done in three- 
quarters of an hour. Take but the skewers and serve 
with brown gravy and red-current jelly. To bake the 
rabbit, proceed in the same manner as above. In a good 
oven it will take about the same time as roasting. Most 
cooks garnish the rabbit with slices of lemon and serve 
up with current jelly. Sometimes the head is cut off 
before sending to the table, but this is a matter of indi- 
vidual taste. 

STEWED RABBIT, LARDED. 

One rabbit, a few strips of bacon, rather more than 
one pint of good broth or stock, a bunch of savory herbs, 
salt and pepper to taste, thickening of butter and flour, 
one glass of sherry. Well wash the rabbit, cut it into 
quarters, lard them with slips of bacon and fry them; 
then put them into a stewpan with the broth, herbs and 
a seasoning of pepper and salt; simmer gently until the 
rabbit is tender, then strain the gravy, thicken it with 
butter and flour, add the sherry, give one boil, pour it 
over the rabbit and serve. Garnish with slices of cut 
lemon. 

FRICASSEED RABBITS. 
The best way of cooking rabbits is to fricassee them. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 69 

Cnt them up, or disjoint them. Put them into a stew- 
pan i season them with Cayenne pepper, salt and some 
chopped parsley. Pour in a pint of warm water (or of 
real broth, if you have it) and stew it over a slow fire till 
the rabbits are quite tender; adding (when they are 
about half done) some bits of butter rolled in flour. 
Jnst before you take it from the fire, enrich the gravy 
with a gill or more of thick cream with some nntmeg 
' grated into it. Stir the gravy well, but take care not to 
let it boil after the cream is in, least it curdle. Put the 
pieces of rabbit on a hot dish, and pour the gravy over 
them. 

A PRETTY DISH OF VENISON. 

Cut a breast of venison in steaks, make quarter of a 
pound of butter hot, in a pan, rub the steaks over with a 
mixtnre of a little salt and pepper, dip them in wheat 
flour, or rolled crackers, and fry a rich brown ; when both 
sides are done, take them np on a dish, and pnt a tin 
cover over; dredge a heaping teaspoonful of flour into 
the butter in the pan; stir it with a spoon nntil it is 
brown, withont burning; put to it a small teacup of boil- 
ing water, with a tablespoonful of currant jelly dissolved 
into it, stir it for a few minutes, then strain it over the 
meat and serve. A glass of wine, with a tablespoonful 
of white sugar dissolved in it, may be nsedfor the gi^vy, 
instead of the jelly and water. Yenison may be boiled, 
and served with boiled vegetables, pickled beets, etc., airJ 
sauce. 

TO BROIL, VENISON STEAKS. 
Xet the gridiron become hot, rub the bars with a 



70 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

bit of suet, then lay on the steaks, having dipped them 
in rolled crackers or wheat flour, and set it over a bright, 
clear, but not fierce fire of coals; when one side is done, 
take the steak carefully over the steak dish, and hold it 
so that the blood may fall into the dish, then turn it 
on the gridiron, let it broil nicely; set a steak dish where 
it will become hot, put on a bit of butter the size of an 
egg for each pound of venison, put to it a saltspoon of 
salt, and the same of black pepper, put to it a table- 
spoonful of currant jelly, made liquid with a tablespoon- 
ful of hot water or wine; lay the steaks on, turn them 
once or twice in the gravy, and serve hot. Or they may 
be simply broiled, and served with butter, pepper and 
salt ; or having broiled one side, and turned the steaks, 
lay thin slices of lemon over, and serve in the dish with 
the steaks. 

BEEFSTEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING-. 

Two pounds of rump- steak, two kidneys, seasoning 
to taste of salt and black pepper, suet crust made with 
milk {see Pastky), in the proportion of six ounces of 
suet to each one pound of flour. 

Mode : Procure some tender rump-steak (that which 
has been hung a little time), and divide it into pieces 
about an inch square, and cut each kidney into eight 
pieees. Line the dish (of which we have given an en- 
graving) with crust made with suet and flour in the 
above proportion, leaving a small piece of crust to over- 
lap the edge. Then cover the bottom with a portion of 
the steak and a few pieces of kidney; season with salt 
and pepper (some add a little flour to thicken the gravy, 
but it is not necessary), and then add another layer of 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOQJi. 71 

steak, kidney and seasoning. F'roceed in this manner 
till the dish is full, when pour in sufficient-water to come 
within two inches of the top of the basin. Moisten the 
edges of the crust, cover the pudding over, press the two 
crusts together, that the gravy may not escape, and turn 
up the overhanging paste. Wring out. a cloth in hot 
water, flour it, and tie up the pudding; put it into boil- 
ing water, and let it boil for at least four hours. If the 
water diminishes, always replenish with some, hot in a 
Jug, as the pudding should be kept covered all the time, 
and not allowed to stop boiling. When the cloth is re- 
moved, cut a round piece in the top of the crust, to pre- 
vent the pudding bursting, and send it to table in the 
basin, either in an ornamental dish, or with a napkin 
pinned round it. Serve quickly.

BREAKFAST DISHES. 



HASHED COLD MEAT. 

Take your bones and stew them in a little water 
with an onion, some salt and pepper, and, if you like, a 
little savory herbs ; when the goodness is all out of the 
bones, and it tastes nice, thicken the gravy with a tea- 
spoonful of corn starch, and if it is not very strong 
put in a bit of butter, then place your stewpan on the 
hot hearth and put in your slices of meat. Warm but 
not boil. Serve with toasted bread, 

POTATO AND BEEF HASH. 

Mince some cold beef, a little fat with the lean, put 
to it as much cold boiled potatoes chopped as yon like 
(the quantity as of meat or twice as much), season with 
pepper and salt; add as much gravy or hot water as will 
make it moist, then put in a stewpan over a gentle fire; 
dredge in a small quantity of wheat iiour ; stir it about 
with a spoon, cover the stewpan and let it simmer for 
half an hour; take care that it does not burn. Dish it 
with or without a slice of toast under it for breakfast. 
This hash may be made without potatoes, if water is used 



THB EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. 73 

instead of gravy; a bit of butter may be added, more or 
less, aocotding to the proportion of fat with the lean 
meat. 

DRIED BEEF. 

The most common way of serving dried or smoked 
beef is to shave it into thin slices or chips, raw; but a 
more savory relish may be made of it with little trouble. 
Put the slices of uncooked beef into a frying pan with 
just enough boiling water to cover them; set them over 
the fire for ten minutes, drain ofE all the water, and with 
a knife and fork cut the meat into small bits. Eeturn 
to the pan, which should be hot, with a tablespoonful of 
butter and a little pepper. Have ready some well-beaten 
eggs, allowing four to a half pound of beof ; stir them 
into the pan with the minced meat and toss and stir the 
mixture for about two minutes. Send to table in a cov- 
ered dish. 

CHICKEN CUTLETS. 

Season pieces of cold chicken or turkey with salt 
and pepper. Dip in melted butter; let this cool on the 
meat, and dip in beaten egg and in fine bread-crumbs. 
Fry in butter till a delicate brown. Serve on slices of 
hot toast, with either a white or curry sauce poured 
around. Pieces 6i cold veal make a nice dish, if pre- 
pared in this manner. 

BEEF PATTIES. 

Chop fine some cold beef; beat two eggs and mix 



74 TH^ EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

with the meat and add a little milk, melted butter, and 
salt and pepper. Make into rolls and fry. 

JELLIED VEAL. 

. Boil the veal tender, pick it up fine, put in a mold, 
add the water it was boiled in, and set it in a cold place; 
season with salt and pepper to taste; a layer, of hard- 
boiled eggs improves it. 

RICE AND MEAT CROQUETTES. 

One cupful of boiled rice, one cupful of finely- 
chopped cooked meat — any kind; one teaspoonful of 
salt^ a little pepper, two tablespoonf uls of butter, half a 
cupful of milk, one egg. Put the milk on to boil, and 
add the meat, rice and seasoning. "When this boils, add 
the egg, well beaten; stir one minute. After cooling, 
shape, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry as before directed. 

AMERICAN TOAST. 

To one egg thoroughly beaten, put one cup of sweet 
milk and a little salt. Slice light bread and dip into the 
mixture, allowing each slice to absorb some of the milk; 
then brown on a hot buttered griddle; spread with but- 
ter, and serve hot. 

MEAT AND POTATOES. 

Mince beef or mutton, small, with onions, pepper 
and salt; add a little gravy, put into scalloped shells or 
small cups, making them three parts full, and fill them 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 75 

up with potatoes mashed with a little cream, put a bit 
of butter on the top and brown them in an oven. 

BREADED SAUSAG-ES. 

Wipe the sausages dry, Dip them in beaten egg 
and bread-crumbs. Put them in the frying-basket and 
plunge into boiling-fat. Cook ten minutes. Serve with 
a garnish of toasted bread and parsley. 

HAM CROQUETTES. 

One cupful of finely -chopped cooked ham, one of 
bread-crumbs, two of hot mashed potatoes, one large 
tablespoonful ot butter, three eggs, a speck of Cayenne. 
Beat the ham, Cayenne pepper, butter, and two of the 
eggs into the potato. Let the mixture cool slightly, and 
shape it into croquettes. EoU in the bread-crumbs, dip 
in beaten egg and again in crumbs, put in the frying- 
basket and plunge into boiling fat. Cook two minutes. 
Drain, and serve. 

A NICE BREAKFAST DISH. 

Chopped cold meat well seasoned; wet with gravy, 
if convenient, put it on a platter; then take cold rice 
made moist with Uailk and one egg, season with pepper 
and salt; if not sufficient rice, add powdered bread- 
crumbs, place this around the platter quite thick; set in 
oven to heat and brown. 

CHICKEN IN JELLY 

A little cold chicken (about one pint), one cupful of 
water or stock, one-fifth of a box of gelatine, half a tea- 



76 THE EVEETDAY COOK BOOK. 

spoonful of curry powder, salt and pepper. Cut the 
meat from the bones of a chicken left from dinner. Put 
the bones on with water to cover, and boil down to one 
cupful. Put the gelatine to soak in one-fourth of a cup- 
ful of cold water. When, the stock is reduced as much 
as is necessary, strain and season;. add the curry and 
chicken ; season and simmer ten minutes, then add the 
gelatine and stir on the table until it is dissolved ; turn all 
into a mold and set aWay to harden. This makes a nice 
relish for tea or lunch. If you have mushrooms omit 
the curry and cut four of them into dice; stir into the 
mixture while cooking. This dish can be varied by using 
the whites of hard-boiled eggs or bits of boiled ham. 
To serve: Dip the mold in warm water and turn out on 
the dish; warnish with parsley. 

A GOOD DISH. 

Minced cold beef or lamb; if beef, put in a pinch of 
pulverized cloves; if lamb, a pinch of summer savory to 
season it, very little pepper and some salt and put it in 
a Jjaking dish; mash potatoes and mix them with cream 
and butter and a little salt and spread them over the 
meat; beat up an egg with cream or milk, a very little, 
spread it over the potatoes and bake it a short time, sufiB- 
cient to warm it through and brown the potatoes. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 77 



POULTRY, GAME, ETC. 



In choosing poultry, the best way to determine 
whether it is young is to try the skin under the leg or 
wing; if it is easily broken it is yoting; or turn the 
wing backwards; if the joint yields readily it is tender; 
ft fat foul is best for any purpose. 

After a chicken or fowl is killed, plunge it into a 
pot of scalding hot water, then pluck off the feathers, 
taking care not to tear the skin ; when it is picked clean 
roll up a sheet of white wrapping paper, set fire to it, 
singe off all the hairs. Poultry should be carefully 
picked and nicely singed. 

If a fowl is fresh killed the vent will be close and 
the flesh have a pleasant smell. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

Carefully pluck the bird, singe it with white paper 
and wipe it thoroughly with a cloth; draw it, preserve 
the liver and gizzard and be particular not to break the 
gall-bag, as no washing will remove the bitter taste it 
imparts were it once touches. Wash it inside well and 
wipe it thoroughly with a dry cloth; the outside merely 
requires wiping nicely. Cut off the neck close to the 
back, but leave enough of the crop-skin to turn over; 
break the leg bones close below the knee, draw out the 
strings from the thighs and flatten the breast bone to 



78 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

make it look plump; have ready your dressing of bread 
crumbs mixed with butter, pepper, salt, thyme or sweet 
marjoram ; fill the breast with this and sew the neck over 
to the back. Be particular that the turkey is firmly 
trussed; dredge it lightly with flower and put a piece of 
butter into the basting ladle; as the butter melts baste 
the bird with.it. "When of a nice brov\(n and well frothed 
serve with a tureen of good brewn gravy and one of 
bread sauce. The liver should be put under one pinion 
and the gizzard under the other. Fried sausages are a 
favorite addition to roast turkey; they make a pretty 
garnish besides adding much to the flavor. When these 
are not at hand, a few force-meat balls should be placed 
round the dish as a garnish. Turkey may also be stuffed 
with sausage-meat and a chestnut force-meat with the 
same sauce, is, by many persons, mtich esteemed as an 
accompaniment to this favorite dish. 

Second Recipe — After drawing and cleansing the 
turkey, prepare a dressing of chopped sausage and bread 
crumbs, mixing in butter, pepper, salt and thyme to 
flavor. Fill the craw and the body of the turkey ^ith 
this and sew up carefully; dredge with flonr and put in 
the oven to roast, basting freely^ first with butter and 
water, then with the gravy from the pan. The time it 
takes to roast will depend both on the age and weight of 
the turkey. If you have a good fire you will be safe to 
allo^ ten minutes or so to the pound. Roast to a fine 
brown and serve with the chopped giblets, which should 
be well stewed; add cranberry sauce. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Hen turkeys are the best for boiling. They are the 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 79 

whitest and, if nicely kept, tenderest. Of course the 
sinews must be drawn, and they ought to be trussed with 
the legs out so as to be easily carved. Take care to clean 
the turkey well after it has been singed. Place the fowl 
in a sufficiently large pot with clean water sufficient to 
cover ic and little more; let the fire be a clear one but 
not too fierce, as the slower the turkey boils the plumper 
it will be. Skim carefully and constantly, and simmer 
for two hours and a half in the case of a large fowl, and 
two hours for a smaller one, and from an hour and ten 
to forty minutes for still smaller turkeys. Some people 
boil their turkeys in a fioured cloth. I don't; the white- 
ness being mostly in the turkey itself. My staffing for 
a boiled turkey is thought good. I prepare it of crumbs 
of stale bread with a little marrow or butter, some finely 
fehred parsley and two dozen of small oysters, minus their 
beards, of course, and neatly trimmed. Stuff with this 
and a little chopped ham in addition if desired. 

TO ROAST A FOWL OR CHICKEN. ' 

Have a bright, clear, and steady fire tor roasting poul- 
try; prepare it as directed; spit it, put a pint of hot 
water in the dripping-pan, add to it a small tablespoon- 
f ul of salt, and a small teaspoonful of pepper, baste fre- 
quently, and let it roast quickly, without scorching; when 
nearly done, put a piece of butter the size of a large egg 
to the water in the pan; when it melts, baste with it, 
dredge a little flour over, baste "again, and let it finish; 
half an hour will roast a full-grown chicken, if the fire is 
right. "When done take it up, let the giblets (heart, liver 
and gizzard) boil tender, and chop them very fine, and 
put them in the gravy ; add a tablespoonf ul of browned 



80 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

flour and a bit of butter, stir it over the fire for a few 
minutes, then serve in a gravy tureen-. Or put the gib- 
lets in the pan and let them roast. 

BOILED CHICKENS. 

Clean, wash and stuff as for roasting. Baste a flour- 
ered cloth around each, and put into a pot with enough 
boiling water to cover them well. The hot water cooks 
the skin at once, and prevents the escape of the juices. 
The broth will not be so rich as if the fowls are put on in 
cold water, but this is proof that the meat will be more 
nutritious and better flavored. Stew very slowly, for 
the first half hour especially. Eoil an hour or more, 
guiding yourself by size and toughness. Serve with egg 
or bread sauce. 

BROILED CHICKEN". 

Prepare in the same way as for boiling, cut them in 
two through the back, and flatten them ; place on a cold 
gridiron over a nice red fire. After a little time, when 
they have become thoroughly hot, set them on a plate or 
other dish, and lard them well with a piece of butter; 
pepper and salt them to taste, chiefly on the inside, then 
place them on the brander and continue turning till done; 
they will take fully twenty minutes. Serve hot, with a 
little dab of butter and plenty of stewed mushrooms — 
a delightful dish. 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicJien in pieces, lay it in salt and water 
which change several times ; roll'each piece in flour; fry 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 81 

in very hot lard or butter; season with salt and pepper; 
fiy parsley with them also. Make a gravy of cream 
seasoned with salt, pepper and a little mace, thickened with 
a little flour in the pan in which the chickens were fried ^ 
pouring off the lard. 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN- 

Cut into joints, scald and skin, place in a stewpan, 
with two raw onions cut into eight parts, a little chopped 
parsley, salt and pepper, and the least squeeze of lemon- 
juice. Add a bit of butter as large as an egg, and fill in 
a pint of water. Stew for an hour under a very close lid, 
then lift-and strain off the gravy, into which beat gradu- 
ally a teacupful of cream and the yolks of two eggs; heat 
up the gravy, taking care that it does not boil, and pour 
it over the fricassee. 

TO CURRY CHICKEN. 

Slice an onion and brown in a little butter; add a 
spoonful of curry powder; allow it to remain covered for 
a few minutes to cook; add a little more butter and put 
in chicken, veal, etc.; cut up small, thicken with a little 
flour. This is excellent. 

PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Cut up the fowls and place in a kettle with a tight 
cover, so as to retain the steam; put about two teacups 
of water and plenty of salt and pepper over the chicken, 
then let it cook until the meat cleaves easily from the 
bones; cut or chop all the meat (freed from skin, bone

into a dish and pour theremnant of the juice in which it 
was cooked over it. This will jelly when cold, and can 
then be sliced or set on the table in shaoe. Nice for tea 
or lunch. The knack of making this simple dish is not 
having too much water; it will not jelly if too weak, or 
if the water is allowed to boil away entirely while 
cooking. 

CHICKEN POT-PIE. 

Skin and cut up the fowls into joints, and put the 
neck, legs and back bones in a stew pan, with a little 
water, an onion, a bunch of savory herbs, and a blade of 
mace;' let these stew for an hour, and, when done, strain 
off the liquor; this is for gravy. But a layer of fowl at 
the bottom oi a pie-dish, then a layer of ham, then one 
of force-meat and hard-boiled eggs, cut in rings; between 
the layers put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, 
- pepper and salt. Pour in about half a pint of water, 
border the edge of dish with puff -crust, put on the cover, 
ornament the top and glaze it by brushing over it the 
yolk of an egg. Bake for about an hour and a half, and, 
when done, pour in at- the top the gravy made from the 
bones. 

A CHICKEN SALAD. 

Take a fine white bunch of celery (four or five 
heads), scrape and wash it white; reserve the delicate 
green leaves; shred the white part like straws, lay this in 
a glass, or white china dish, in the form of a nest. 
Mince all the white meat of a boiled, or white stewed 
fowl, without the skin, and put it in the nest. 

Make a salad dressing thus: Bub the yolks of two 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 83 

hard-boiled eggs to a smooth paste, with a dessert- 
spoonful of salad oil or meltsd butter; add to it two 
teaspoonfuls of made mustard, and a small teaspoonful 
ot fine ^hite sugar, and put to it gradually (stirring it 
in) a large cup of strong vinegar. 

Make a wreath ot the most delicate leaves of the 
celery around the edge of the nest, between it and the 
chicken; pour the dressing over the chicken, when ready 
to serve; if the dressing is poured over too soon it will 
discolor the celery. 

White heart lettuce may be used for the nest in- 
stead of celery, 

JELLIED CHICKEN. 

Boil a fowl till it will slip easily from the bones; let 
the water be reduced to about one pint in boiling; pick 
the meat from the bones in good sized pieces, taking out 
all gristle, fat and bones; place in a wet mold; sMm the 
fat from the liquor; a little butter; pepper and salt to 
the taste, and one-half ounce of gelatine. When this dis- 
solves, pour it hot over the chicken. The liquor must be 
seasoned pretty high, for the chicken absorbs. 

CHICKEN* PATES. 

Mince chicken that has been previously roasted or 
boiled, and season well; stir into this a sa!uce made of 
half a pint of milk, into yhich while boiling a teaspoon- 
ful of corn starch has been added to thicken, season with 
butter, about a teaspoonful, and salt and pepper tp taste.

SAGE-AND-ONION STUFFING-^ FOR GEESE, 
DUCKS AND PORK. 

Four large onions, ten sage leaves, one-quarter 
pound of bread crumbs, one and one-half ounce of but- 
ter, salt and pepper to taste, one egg. Peel the onions, 
put them into boiling water, let them simmer lor five 
nlinutes or rather longer, and, just before they are taken 
out, put in the sage-leaves foraminute or two to take off 
their rawness. Chop both these very fine, add the bread^ 
seasoning and butter, and work the whole together with 
the yolk of an egg, when the stuffing will be ready for 
use. It should be rather highly seasoned, and the sage- 
leaves should be very finely chopped Many cooks do not 
parboil the onions in the manner just stated, but merely 
use them raw. The stuflBng then, however, is not nearly 
so mild, and, to many tastes, its strong flavor would be 
very objectionable. When made fof goose, a portion of 
the liver of the bird, simmered for a few minutes and 
very finely- minced, is frequently added to this stufiing; 
.and where economy is studied, the egg may be dispensed 
with. 

TO ROAST A GOOSE. 

Having drawn and singed the goose, wipe out the 
inside with a cloth, and sprinkle in some pepper and salt. 
Make a stuffing of four good-sized onions, minced fine, 
and half their quantity of green sage-leaves, minced also, 
a large teacupful of grated bread-crumbs, a piece of but- 
ter thesize of a walnut, and the beaten yolks of two egga 
with a little pepper and salt. Mix the whole togethei^ 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 8ti 

and incorporate them well. Put the stuffing into the 
goose, and press it in hard ; but do not entirely fill up 
die cavity, as the mixture will swell in cooking. Tie the 
goose securely round with a greased or wetted string; 
and paper the breast to prevent it from scorching. The 
fire must be brisk and well kept up. It will require 
from two hours to two and a half to roast. Baste it at 
first with a little salt and water, and then with its own 
gravy. Take off the paper when the goose is about half 
done, and dredge it witii a little flour towards the last. 
Having parboiled the liver and heart, chop them and put 
them into the gravy, which must be skimmed well and 
thickened with a little brown flour. 

Send apple sauce to table with the goose; also 
mashed potatoes. 

A goose may be stuffed entirely with potatoes boiled 
and mashed with milk, butter, pepper and salt. 

You may make a gravy of the giblets, that is the 
neck, pinions, liver, heart and gizzard stewed in a little 
water, thickened with butter, rolled in flour and seasoned 
with pepper and salt. Before you send it to table take 
out all but the liver and heart, mince them and leave 
them in the gravy. This gravy is by many preferred to 
that which comes from the goose in roasting. It is well 
to have both. 

If a goose is old it is useless to cook it, as when hard 
and tongh it cannot be eaten. 

ROAST DUCKS. 

Wash and dry the ducks carefully. Make a stuffing 
of sage and onion, insert and sew up completely that the 
seasoning may not escape. If tender, ducks do not re- 



88 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

quire more than an hour to roast. Keep them well 
basted, and a few minutes before serving dredge lightly 
with flour to make them froth and look plump. Send to 
table hot with a good brown gravy poured not round but 
over them. Accompany with current jelly and, if in 
season, green peas. 

ROAST PIG-EONS. 

Clean the pigeons and stufE them the same as chick- 
ens; leave the feet on, dip them into scalding water, strip 
off the skin, cross them and tie them together below the 
breast bone, or cut them off; the head may remain on; 
if so, dip it in scalding water and pick it clean, twist the 
wings back, put the liver between the right wing and the 
body and turn the head under the other, rub the outside 
of each bird with a mixture of pepper and salt, spit 
them and put some water i^n the dripping-pan; for each 
bird put a bit of butter the size of a small egg, put them 
before a hot fire and let them roast quickly, baste fre- 
quently, half an hour will do them ; when nearly done, 
dredge them with wheat flour and baste with the blotter 
jn the pan, turn them that they may be nicely and easily 
browned ; when done take them up, set the pan over the 
fire, make a thin batter of a teaspoonful of wheat flour 
and cold water; when the gravy is boiling hot stir it in; 
continue to stir it for a few minutes until it is brown, 
then pour it through a gravy sieve into a tureen and 
serve with the pigeons. 

TO MAKE A BIRD'S NEST. 
Boil some yellow macaroni gently until it xs quite 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 87 

swelled out and tender, then cut in pieces the length of 
a iinger and lay them on a dish like a straw nest. 

Truss pigeons with the heads on (having scalded and 
picked them clean) turned under the left wing, leave the 
feet on, and, having stewed them, arrange them as in a 
nest; pour the gravy over- and serve. 

The nest may be made of boiled rice or bread cut in 
pieces the length and thickness of a finger and fried a 
nice brown in hot lard seasoned with pepper and salt; or 
make it of bread toasted a yellow brown. Any small 
birds may be stewed or roasted and served in this way. 

PIG-EONS IN JELLY. 

Wash and truss one dozen pigeons. Put them in a 
kettle with four pounds of the shank of veal,- six cloves, 
twenty-five pepper-corns, an onion that has been fried iu 
one spoonful of butter, one stalk of celery, a bouquet of 
sweet herbs and four and a half quarts of water. Have 
the veal shank broken in small pieces. As soon as the 
contents of the kettle come to a boil skim carefully and 
set for three hours where they will just simmer. After 
they' have been cooking one hour add two tablespoon fals 
of salt. When the pigeons are done take them up, being 
careful not to break them, and remove the strings. Draw 
the kettle forward where it will boil rapidly, and keep 
there for forty minutes; then strain the liquor through a 
napkin and taste to see if seasoned enough. The water 
should have been boiled down to two and a half quarts. 
Have two molds that will each hold six pigeons; put a 
thin layer of the jelly in these and set on ice to harden. 
When hard arrange the pigeons in them and cover with 
the jelly, which must be cold but liquid. Place in the 



88 THE Everyday cook book. 

ice-chest' for six or (better still) twelve hours. There 
should be only one layer of the pigeons in the mold. 

To serve: Dip the mold in a basin of warm water 
for one minute and turn on a cold dish. Garnish with 
pickled beets and parsley. A Tartare sauce can be 
served with this dish. 

If squabs are used, two hours will xook them. All 
small birds, as well as partridge, grouse, etc., can be pre- 
pai^ed in the same manner. Eemember that the birds 
must be cooked tender, and that the liquor must be re- 
duced that it will become jellied. 



PIGEON PIE. 

Clean and truss three or four pigeons, rub the out- 
side and imvith a mixture of pepper and salt; rub the 
inside with a bit of butter, and fill it with a bread-and- 
butter stufiing, or mashed potatoes; sew up the slit, 
butter the sides of a tin basin or pudding-dish, and line 
(the sides only) with pie paste, rolled to quarter ot an 
inch thickness; lay the birds in; for three large tame 
pigeons, cut quarter of a pound of sweet butter and put 
it over them, strew over a large teaspoonful of salt and a 
small teaspoonful of pepper, with a bunch of finely-cut 
parsley, if liked; dredge a large teaspoonful of wheat 
fiour over; put in water to nearly fill the pie; lay skew- 
ers across the top, cover with a puff paste crust; cut a 
slit in the middle, ornament tbe edge with leaves, braids, 
or shells of paste, and put it in a moderately hot or 
quick oven for one hour; when nearly done, brush the 
top over with the yolk of an egg beaten with a little

THE TABLE LAID-THE SOUP SERVED. 

A dinner party should consist, of an equal number of gentlemen and 
ladies; those being invited who itis thought will like to meet. It is not nec- 
essary to introduce all the membei-s of the party to each other; in a friend's 
house all talk to each other without introduction, and without this form

DESSEBT. 

All the dishes for dessert are now usually placed down the center of the 
t,i l)le, dried or fresh fruit alternately, the former being arranged on small 
nnnid or oval glass plates, and the latter on the dishes with stems. The 
fruit shouldalways Be gathered on the same day that it is reaulred for the

milk, and finish. The pigeons for this pie may be cut 
in two or more pieces, if preferred. 

Any small birds may be done in this manner. 

WILD DUCKS. 

Nearly all wild dncks are liable to have a fishy fla- 
vor, and when handled by inexperienced cooks, are 
sometimes uneatable from this cause. Before roasting 
them guard against this by parboiling them with a small 
carrot, peeled, put within each. This will absorb the 
unpleasant taste. An onion will have the same effect; 
but unless you mean to use onion in the stuffing, the 
carrot is preferable. In my own kitchen, I usually put 
in the onion, considering the suspicion of garlic a desid- 
eratum in roast duck, whether wild or tame. 

ROAST WILD DUCK. 

Parboil as above directed; throw away the carrot or 
onion, lay in fresh water half an hour; stufl with bread- 
crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt, sage, and onion, and 
roast until brown and tender, basting lor half the time 
with butter and water, then with the drippings. Add to 
the gravy, when you have taken up the ducks, a tea- 
spoonful of currant jelly and a pinch of Cayenne. 
Thicken with browned flour and serve in a tureen. 

WILD TURKEY. 

Draw and wash the inside very carefully, as with 
all game. Domestic , fowls are, or should be, kept up 
without eating for at least twelve hours before they are 
Idiled; but we must shoot wild when we can get

the change, and of course it often happens that their 
crops are distended by a recent hearty meal of rank or 
green food, Wipe the cavity with a dry, soft cloth be- 
fore you stuff. Have a rich force-meat, bread-crumbs, 
some bits of fat pork, chopped fine, pepper and salt. 
Moisten with milk, and beat in an egg and a couple of 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Baste with butter and 
water for the first hour, then three or four times with 
gravy; lastly, five or six times with melted butter. A 
generous and able housekeeper told me once that she al- 
ways allowed a pound of butter for basting a large wild 
turkey. This was an extravagant quantity, but the meat 
is drier than that of the domestic fowl, and not nearly 
so fat. Dredge with flour at the last,.froth with butter, 
and when he is of a tempting brown, serve. Skim the 
gravy, add a little hot water, pepper, thicken with the 
giblets chopped fine and browned floiir, boil up, and pour 
into a tureen. At the South the giblets are not put in 
the gravy, but laid whole, one under each wing, when 
the turkey is dished. Garnish with small fried sausages, 
not larger than a dollar, crisped parsley between them. 
Send around currant jelly and cranberry sauce with it. 

TO ROAST SNIPES, "WOODCOCKS, OR 
PLOVERS. 

Pick them immediately; wipe them and season 
them slightly with pepper and salt. Cut as many slices 
of bread as you have birds. Toast them brown, butter 
them, and lay them in the pan. Dredge the birds with 
flour and put them in the oven with a brisk fire. Baste 
them with lard or fresh Ijutter. They will be done in 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOS. 91 

twenty or thirty minntes. S6rve them np laid on the 
toast, and garniBh with sliced orange, or with orange 
jelly. 

ROAST PARTRIDG-E. 

Choose young birds, with dark-colored bills and yel- 
lowish legs, and let them hang a few days, or there will 
be no flavor to the flesh, nor will it be tender. The time 
they should be kept entirely depends on the taste of 
those for whom they are intended, as what some persons 
would consider delicious, would be to others disgusting 
and offensive. They may be trussed with or without the 
head; the latter mode is now considered the most fash- 
ionable. Pluck, draw and wipe the partridge carefully 
inside and out; cut off the head, leaving sufficient skin 
on the neck to skewer back; bring the legs close to 
the breast, between it and the side-bones, and pass a 
skewer through the pinions and thick part of the thighs. 
When the head is left on it should be brought round 
and fixed on to the point of the skewer. When the bird 
is flrmly and plumply trussed, roast it before a nice 
bright fire; keep it well basted, and a few minutes be- 
fore serving flour and froth it well. Dish it, and serve 
with gravy and bread-sauce, and send to the table hot 
and quickly. A httle of the gravy should be poured 
over the bird. 

ROAST QUAIL, 

JPluck and draw the birds, rub a little butter over 
them, tie a strip of bacon over the breasts, and set them 
in the oven for twenty or twenty-five minutes. 

ROAST PRAIRIE CHICKEN. 

The bird being a little strong, and its flesh when 



)2 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

cooked a little dry, it should be either larded or wide 
strips of bacon or pork placed over its breast. A mild 
reasoned stuflBng will improve the flavor of old birds. 
Dust a little flour over them, baste occasionally, and 
serve. I'heasants may be managed in the same manner. 

LARDED GROUSE. 

Clean and wash the grouse. Lard the breast and 
legs. Put a small skeWer into the legs and through the 
tail. Tie firmly with twine. Dredge with salt, and rub 
the breast with soft butter; then dredge thickly with flour. 
Put into a quick oven. If it be very rare, cook twenty 
minutes; if wished better done, thirty minutes. The 
former time, as a general thing, suits gentlemen better, 
but thirty minutes is preferred by ladies. If the birds 
are cooked in a tin-kitchen, it should be for thirty or 
thirty-five minutes. When done, place on a hot dish on 
which has been spread bread-sauce. Sprinkle fried crumbs 
over both grouse and sauce. Garnisli with parsley. The 
grouse may, instead, be served on a hot dish, with the 
parsley garnish, and the sauce and crumbs served in sep- 
arate dishes. The first method is the better, however^ as 
you get in the sauce all the gravy that comes from the 
birds. 

PORK, HAMS, ETC. 

To Choose Poek. — If the rind of pork is tough and 
thick, and cannot easily be impressed with the finger, it 
is old. 

' If fresh, the flesh will look cool and smooth; when 
moist or clammy it is stale. The knuckle is the first to 
become tainted. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 93 

Pork is often what is called measly, and is then al- 
most poisonous; measly pork may easily be detected, the 
fat being full of small kernels. Swill or still-fed pork is 
not fit for curing; either dairy or corn-fed is good. 

Fresh pork is in season from October to April. 

In cntting up a large hog, it is first cut in two down 
the back and belly. The chine or back-bone should be 
cut out from each side the whole length, and is either 
boiled or roasted. The chine is considered the prime 
part. The sides of the hog are made into bacon, and the 
inside or ribs is cut with very little meat; this is the 
spare-ribs. 

CURING HAMS. 

Hang up the hams a week or ten days, the longer 
the tenderer and better, if kept perfectly sweet; mix for 
each good-sized ham, one teacup of salt, one tablespoon 
of molasses, one ounce of saltpetre; lay the hams in a 
dean dry tub; heat the mixture and rub well into the 
hams, especially around the bones and recesses; repeat 
iae process once or twice, or until all the mixture is used ; 
then let the hams lie two or three days, when they must 
be put for three weeks in brine strong enough to bear an 
egf;; then soak eight hours in cold water; hang up to 
dry in the kitchen or other more convenient place lor a 
week or more; smoke from three to five days, being 
careful not to heat the hams. Corn-cobs and apple-tree 
wood are good for smoking. The juices are better re- 
tained if smoked with the hock down. Tie up carefully 
in bags for the summer. 

TO ROAST A LEG OF PORK. 

Take a sharp knife and score the skin across in 



94 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

narrow strips (you may cross it again so as to form did 
monds) and rub in some powdered sage. Raise the skir- 
at the knuckle and put in a stuffing of minced onion and 
sage, bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, and beaten yolk of egg. 
Fasten it down with a buttered string, or with skewers. 
You may make deep incisions in the meat of the large 
end of the leg, and stuff them also, pressing in the filling 
very hard. Eub a little sweet oil all over the skin with 
a brush or a goose feather, to make it -risp and of a 
handsome brown. A leg of pork will require from three 
to four hours to roast. Moisten it all the time by brash- 
ing it with sweet oil, or with fresh butter tied in a rag. 
To baste it with its own drippings will make the skin 
tough and hard. SMm the fat carefully from the gravy, 
which should be thickened with a little flour. 

A roast leg of pork should always be accompanied 
by apple sauce, and by mashed potatioes and maahed 
turnips. 

PORK AND BEANS, 

Pick over carefully a q^uart of beans and let then^ 
soak over night; in the morning wash and drain in an- 
other water, put on to boil in cold water with half a tea- 
spoonful of soda, boil about thirty minutes (when done 
the skin of a bean will crack if taken out and blown 
upon), drain, and put in an earthen pot first a Blioe of 
pork and then the beans with two or three tablespoons 
of molasses. When the beans are in the pot, put in the 
centre half or three quarters of a pound of well-washed 
salt pork with the rind scored in slices or squares and 
uppermost, season with pepper and salt if needed, cover 
8,11 over with hot water and bake six hours or longer in a 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. OS 

moderate oven, adding hot water as needed; they cannot 
be baked too long. Keep covered so that they will not 
bum on top, but remove cover an hour or two before 
serving to brown the top and crisp the pork. 

PORK SAUSAGES. 

Take such a proportion of fat and lean pork as you 
like, chop it quite fine, and for every ten pounds of meat 
take four ounces of fine salt and one uf fine pepper; 
dried sage or lemon thyme, finely powdered, may be added 
il liked; a teaspoonful of sage, and the same of ground 
alspice ana cloves to each ten pounds of meat. Mix the 
seasoning through the meat; pack it down in stone pots 
or put in rouslin bags; or fill the hog's or ox's guts, hav- 
ing first made them perfectly clean, thus: empty them, 
cut them in lengths and lay them three or four days in 
salt and water, or weak lime water, turn them inside out 
once or twice, scrape them, then rinse them and fill with 
the meat. 

If you do not use the skins or guts, make the sau- 
sage meat up to the size and shape of sausages, dip them 
in beaten egg and then into wheat flouv or rolled crack- 
ers, or simply into wheat flour, and fry in hot lard ; turn 
them that every side may be a fine color; serve hot with 
boiled potatoes or hominy; either taken from the gravy 
or after they are fried, pour a little boiling water into 
the gravy in the pan and pour it over them; or first 
dredge in a teaspoonful of wheat fionr, stir it until it is 
smooth and brown, then add a little boiling water, let it 
boil up once, then put it in the dish with the sausages. 

Chopped onion and green parsley may be added to 
the aaosage meat when maMug ready to fry. 



98 , THE EVERYDAY COOK HOOK. 

Or sausage meat may be tied in a, muslin bag and 
boiled and served with vegetables ; or let it become cold 
and cut in slices. 

PORK CHOPS,,STEAKS and OUTLETS. 

Fry or stew pork chop^, after taking off the rind or 
X skin, the same as for veal. 

Cutlets and steaks are also fried, broiled or stewed, 
the same as veal. 

BOAST PIG. 

Thoroughly clean the pig, then rinse it in cold water., 
wipe it dry ; then rub the inside with a mixture of salt, 
and pepper, and if liked a little pounded and sifted sage; 
make a stuffing thus: cut some wheat bread in slices 
half an inch thick, spread butter on to half its thickness, 
sprinkled with pepper and salt, and if liked a little pound- 
ed sage and iriinced onion; pour enough hot water over 
the bread to make it moist or soft, then fill the body with 
it and sew it together, or tie a cord around it to keep the 
drsssins; in, then spit it, pat a pint of water in the drip- 
ping pan, put into it a tablespoonful of salt and a te&- 
spoonf nl of pepper, let the fire be hotter at each end than 
in the middle, put the pig down at a little distance from 
the fire, baste it as it begins to roast, and gradually draw 
it nearer; continue to baste occasionally; turn it that it 
may be eavenly cooked ; when the eyes drop out it is 
done; or a better rule is to judge by the weight-^fifteec 
minutes for each pound of meat, if the fire is right. 

Have a bright, clear fire with a bed of coals at the 
bottom; first put the roast at a little distance and gra^«- 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK 97 

ally draw it nearer; when the pig is done stir up the fire, 
take a coarse cloth with a good bit of butter in it, and 
wet the pig all over with it, and when the crackling is 
crisp take it np, dredge a little flour into the gravy, let 
it boil np once, and having boiled the heart, liver, etc., 
tender, and chopped it fine, add to it the gravy, give it 
one boil, then serve. 

PIG'S CHEEK

ROAST SPARE-RIB. 

Trim off the rough ends neatly, crack the ribs across 
the middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper, fold 
over, stuff with turkey dressing, sew up tightly, place io 
dripping pan with pint of water, baste frequently, turn- 
ing over once so as to bake both sides equally until a 
rich brown. 

PORK FRITTERS. 

Have at hand a thick batter of Indian meal and 
flour; cut a few slices of pork and fry them in the fry- 
ing pan until the fat is fried out, cut a few more slices 
of the pork, dip them in the batter and drop them in 
the bubbling fat, seasoning with salt and pepper; cook 
until light brown and eat while hot. 

BAKED HAM. 
Cover your ham with cold water, and simmer genii; 



98 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

just long enough to loosen the skin so that it can be 
pulled off. This will probably be from two to three 
hours, according to the size of your ham. When skinned 
put in a dripping pan in the oven, pour over it a teacup 
of vinegar and one of hot water, in which dissolve a tea- 
spoonful of English mustard, bake slowly, basting with 
the liquid, for two hours ; then cover the ham all over 
to the depth of one inch with coarse brown sugar, press 
it down firmly, and do not baste again until the sugar 
has formed 'a thick crust, which it will soon do in a very 
slow oven; let it remain a full hour in, after covering 
with 8,ugar, until it becomes a rich golden brown. When 
done, drain from the liquor in the pan and put on a dish 
to cool. When it is cool, but not cold, press by tutning 
another flat dish on top with a weight over it. Tou will 
never want to eat ham cpoked in any other way when you 
have tasted this, and the pressing makes it cut firmly for 
sandwiches or slicing. 

• TO BOIL A. HAM. 

Wash thoroughly with a cloth. Select a small size 
to boil, put it in a large quantity of cold water and boil 
twenty minutes for each pound, allowing it to boil slowly: 
take off the rind while hot and put in the oven to brown 
half an hour; remove and trim.

Cut some slices of ham, quarter of an inch thick, 
lay them in hot. water for half an hour, or give them a 
scalding in a pan over the fire; then take them up and 
lay them on a gridiron, over bright coals; when the out- 



•JmE irVTEliYDAY COOK BOOK. 89 

side is browned, tarn the other; then take the slices on 
a hot dish, butter them Ireely, sprinkle pepper over and 
serve. Or, after scalding them, wipe them dry, dip each 
slice in beaten egg, and then into rolled crackers, and fry 
or broil. 

FRIED HAM AND EG-G-S (a Breakfast Dish). 

Cut the ham into slices, and take care that they are 
of the same thickness in every part. Cut off the rind, 
and if the ham should be particularly hard and salt, it 
will be found an improvement to soak it for about ten 
minutes in hot water, and then dry it in a <sloth. Put it 
into a cold frying-pan, set it over the fire, and turn the 
slices three or four times whilst they are cooking. 
When done, place theji on a dish, which should be kept 
hot in front of the fire during the time the eggs are be- 
ing poached. Poach the eggs; slip them on to the slices 
of ham, and serve quickly. 

HAM TOAST. 

Mince finely a quarter of a pound of cooked ham 
with an anchovy boned and washed; add a little Cayenne 
and pounded mace; beat up two eggs; mix with the 
mince, and add just sufficient milk to keep it moist; 
make it quite hot, and serve on small rounds of toast or 
fried bread. 

HEAD CHEESE. 

Having thoroughly cleaned a hog's head or pig'e 
head, split it in two with a sharp knife, take out the eyesi 
take ont the brains, cut oS the ears, and pour scalding 



100 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

water over them and the head, and scrape them clean. 
Cut off any par* of the nose which may be discolored so 
as not to be scraped clean; then rinse all in cold water; 
and put it into a large kettle with hot (not boiling) water 
to cover it, and set the kettle (having (iovered it) o\'er the 
fire; let it boil gently, taking off the skum as it rises; 
when boiled so that the bones leave the meat readily, take 
it from the water with a skimmer into a large wooded 
bowl or tray; take from it every particle of bone, chop 
the meat small and season to taste with salt and pepper, 
and if liked, a little chopped sage or .thyme; Bpre<Mi a 
cloth in a colander or sieve; set it in a deep dish, aod 
put the meat in, then fold the cloth closely over it, lay a 
weight on which may press equally the whole surface (a 
sufficiently large plate will serve). Let the weight be 
more or less heavy, according as you may wish the cheese 
to be fat or lean ; a heavy weight by pressing out the fat 
will of course leave the cheese lean. When cold, take 
the weight off; take it from the colander or sieve, scrape 
off whatever fat may be found on the outside of the 
cloth, and keep the cheese in the cloth in a cool place, to 
be eaten sliced thin, with or without mustard, and vin- 
egar or catsup. After the water is cold in which the 
head was boiled, take off the fat from it, and whatever 
may have drained from the sieve, or colander, and cloth; 
put it together in some clean water, give it one boil; 
then strain it through a cloth, and set it to become cold; 
then take off the cake of fat. It is fit for any use. 

PIG-S' FEET SOUSED. 

Scald and scrap© clean the feet; if the covering of 
the toes will not come off without, singe them in hot em* 



llTte t:VEftYl)AY COOfe BOOK. m 

bers, Tintil they are loose, then take them off. Many per- 
sons lay them in weak lime water to whiten them. Hav- 
ing scraped them clean and white, wash them and put 
them in a pot of hot (not boiling) water, with a little salt, 
and let them boil gently, tintil by turning a fork in the 
flesh it will easily break and the bones are loosened. 
Take off the scum as it rises. When done, take them 
from the hot water into cold vinegar, enough to cover 
them, add to it one-third as much of the water in which 
they were boiled; add whole pepper and alspice, with 
cloves and mace if liked, put a cloth and a tight-fitting 
cover over the pot or jar. Soused feet may be eaten cold 
from the vinegar, split in two from top to toe, or having 
split them, dip them in wheat flour and fry in hot lard, 
or broil: and butter them. In either case, let them be 
nicely browned. 

TO MAKE LARD 

Take the leaf fat from the inside of a bacon hog, cut 
it small, and put it in an iron kettle, which must be per- 
fectly free from any musty taste; set it over a steady, 
moderate fire, until nothing but scraps remain of the 
meat; the heat must be kept up, but gentle, that it may 
not bum the lard ; spread a coarse cloth in a wire sieve, and 
strain the liquid into tin basins which will hold two or 
three quarts ; squeeze out all the fat from the scraps. When 
the lard in the .pans is cold, press a piece of new muslin 
close upon it, trim it off at the edge of the pan, and keep 
it in a cold place. Or it maybe kept in wooden kegs 
with close covers. Lard made with one-third as much 
beef suet as fat is supposed by many persons to keep better. 

TO TELL GOOD EO-GS. 
Pbt tbem ixk water — if the large end turns up, they 



are nvt fresh. This is an infallible! rule to distinguish a 
good egg from a bad one. 

KEEPING EG-G-S FRESH. 

"All it is necessary to do to keep eggs through sum- 
mer is to procure small, clean wooden or tin vessels, hold- 
ing from ten to twenty gallons, and a barrel, more or 
less, of common, fine-ground land plaster. Begin by put- 
ting on the bottom of the vessel two or three inches of 
plaster, and then, having fresh eggs, with the yolks un- 
broken, set them up, small end down, close to each other, 
but not crowding, and make the first layer. Then add more 
plaster and enough so the eggs will stand upright, and set 
up the second layer; then another deposit of plaster, fol- 
lowed by a layer of eggs, till the vessel is full, and finish by 
covering the top layer with plaster. Eggs so packed and 
subjected to a temperature of at least 85 degrees, it not 
90 degrees, during August and September, came out 
fresh, and if one could be certain of not having a temper- 
ature of more than 76 degrees to contend with, I am 
confident eggs could be kept by these meanes all the year 
round. Observe that the eggs must be fresh laid, the 
yolks unbroken, the packing done in small vessels, and 
with clean, fine-ground land plaster, and care must be 
taken that no egg so presses on another as to break the 
shell." 

Eggs may be kept good for a ylear in the following 
manner: 

To a pail of water, put of unslacked lime and coarse 
salt each a pint; keep it in a cellar, or cool place, and 
put the eggs in, as fresh laid as possible. 

It is well to keep a stone pot of this lime water ready 



THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. 108 

to receive the eggs as soon as laid; make a fresh supply 
every few months. This lime water is of exactly the 
proper strength; strong lime water will cook the eggs. 
Very strong lime water will eat the shell. 

POACHED EGG-S. 

Two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of milk, half a tea- 
spoonfal of salt, half a teaspoonfnl of bntter; beat the 
eggs and add the salt and milk; put the bntter in a small 
sancepan, and when it melts add the eggs ; stir over the 
fire nntil the mixture thickens, being careful not to let it 
cook hard; about two minutes will cook it. The eggs, 
when done, should be soft and creamy. Serve immedi- 
ately. 

DROPPED EGGS. 

Have a quart of boiling water and one tablespoonfnl 
of salt in a frying-pan. Break the eggs one by one into 
a saucer and slide carefully into the salted water; cook 
until the white is firm, and lift out with a griddle-cake 
turner and place on toasted bread. Serve immediately. 

STUFFED EGGS. 

Six hard-boiled eggs cut in two, take out the yolks 
and mash fine, then add two teaspoonfuls of butter, one 
of cream, two or three drops of onion juice, salt and pep- 
per to taste. Mix all thoBOUghly and fill the eggs with 
this mixture; put them together. Then there will be a 
little of the filHng left, to which add one well-beaten egg. 
Cover the eggs with this mixture and then roll in crack- 
er-cmmbs, Fry a light brown iu boiling fat. Plftip 



104 THE EVERTDAST COOK BOOK 

baked eggs make quite a pretty breakfast dish. Take a 
round white-ware dish, thick enough to stand the heat of 
the oven, put into it sufficient fresh butter, and break as 
many eggs in it as are desirable, putting a few bits of 
butter on the top, and set in a rather slow oven until 
they are cooked. Have a dish of nicely-made, buttered 
toast arranged symmetrically on a plate and garnish it 
and the dish of eggs with small pieces of curled parsley. 

EG-GS A LA SUISSE. 

Spread the bottom of a dish with two ounces of 
fresh butter, cover this with grated cheese, break eight 
whole eggs upon the cheese without breaking the yolks. 
Season with red pepper and salt if necessary, pour a lit- 
tle cream on the surface, strew about two ounces of grated 
cheese on the top, and set the eggs in a moderate ot^en 
for about a quarter of an hour. Pass a hot salamabder 
over the top "to brown it. 

EGGS BROyiLLE. 

Six eggs, half a cupful of milk, or, better slill, of 
cream, two mushrooms, one teaspoonful of salt, a little' 
pepper, three tablespoonfuls of butter, a slight grating 
of nutmeg. Cut the mushrooms into dice and fry them 
for one minute in one tablespoonful of the butter; beat 
the eggs, salt, pepper and cream together and put them 
in a saucepan; add the butter and mushrooms to these 
ingredients; stir over a moderate heat until the mixture 
begins to thicken. Take from the fire and beat rapidly 
\iQtil the eggs become quite thick and creamy. lEf^vQ 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 106 

slices ot toast on a hot dish. Heap the mixture on these, 
and garnish with points of toast. Serre immediately. 

CURRIED EGGS. 

Slice two onions and fry in butter, add a tablespoon 
curry-powder and one pint good broth or stock, stew tiU 
onions are quite tender, add a cup of cream thickened 
with arrowroot or rice flour, simmer a few moments, 
then add eight or ten hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices, and 
beat them well, but do not boil. 

CREAMED EGGS. 

Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make one pint of 
cream" sauce. Have six slices of toast on a hot dish. 
Put a layer of sauce on each one, and then part of the 
whites of the eggs, cut in thin strips and rub part of 
the yolks through a sieve on the toast. Bepeat this, and 
finish with a third layer of sauce. Place in the oven for 
ftbout three minutes. Garnish with parsley, and serve. 

SOFT-BOILED EGGS. 

Place the eggs in a warm saucepan, and cover with 
boiling water. Let them stand where they will keep hot, 
but not boil, for ten minutes. This method will cook 
both whites and yolks. 

EGGS UPON TOAST. 

Put a good lump of butter into a frying-pan. When 
it is hot, stir in four or five well-beaten eggs, with pep- 
per, salt, and a little parsley. Stir and toss for threQ 



106 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

minutes. Have ready to your hand some slices of but- 
tered toast (cut round with a tin cake cutter before they 
are toasted); spread thickly with ground or minced 
tongue, chicken, or ham. Heap the stirred egg upon 
these in mounds, and set in a hot dish garnished with 
parsley and pickled beets. 

DUTCH OMELET. 

Break eight eggs into a basin, season with pepper 
and salt, add two ounces of butter cut small, beat these 
well together, make an ounce of butter hot in a irying- 
pan, put the eggs in, continue to stir it, drawing it away 
from the sides, that it may be evenly done, shake it now 
and then to free it from the pan; when the under side 
is a little browned, turn the omelet into a dish, and serve; 
this must be done over a moderate fire. 

EGGS POACHED IN BALLS. 

Put three pints of boiling water into a stewpan ; set 
it on a hot stove or coals; stir the water with a stick un- 
til it runs rapidly around, then having broken an egg 
into a cup, taking care not to break the yolk, drop it into 
the whirling water; continue to stir it until the egg is 
cooked; then take it into a dish with & skimmer and set 
it over a pot ot boiling water; boil one at a time, until 
you have enough. These will remain soft for a long 
time. 

OMELET AU NATURAL. 

Break eight or ten eggs into a basin; add a small 
teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper, with a tablespoon^ 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 107 

ful of cold water; beat the whole well with a spoon or 
whisk. In the meantime put some fresh sweet butter 
into an omelet pan, and when it is nearly hot, put in an 
omelet; while it is frying, with a skimmer spoon raise 
the edges from the pan that it may be properly done. 
When the eggs are set and one side is a fine brown, double 
it half over and serve hot. These omelets should be put 
quite thin in the pan; the butter required for each will 
be about the size of a small egg. 

OMELET IN BATTER. 

Fry an omelet; when done, cut it in squares or 
diamonds; dip each piece in batter made of two eggs and 
a pint of milk, with enough wheat flour, and fry them 
in nice salted lard to a delicate brown. Serve hot, 

SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

Four eggs, one tablespoonful of butter, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Beat the eggs and add the salt to them. 
Melt the butter in a saucepan. Turn in the beaten eggs, 
stir quickly over a hot fire for one minute, and serve. 

OMELET (SPLENDID). 

Six eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately ; halt 
pint milk, six teaspoons corn starch, one teaspoon baking 
powder, and a little salt; add the whites, beaten to stiff 
froth, last; cook in a little batter.

VEGETABLES. 



BOILED POTATOES. 

Old potatoes are far better for being'peeled and pat 
in cold water an hour before being put over to boil. 
They should then be put into fresh cold water, when set 
over the fire. New potatoes should always be put in a 
boiling water, and it is better to prepare them just in 
time for cooking. Are better steamed than boiled. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Potatoes are not good for mashing until they are 
full grown; peel them and lay them in water for an hour 
or, more before boiling, for mashing. 

Old potatoes, when unfit for plain boiling, may be 
served mashed; cut out all imperfections, take off all the 
skin, and lay them in cold water for one hour or more; 
then put them into a dinner-pot or stewpan, with a tea- 
spoonful of salt; cover the stewpan and let them boil for 
Imlf an hour, unless they are large, when three-quarters 
of an hour will be required; when they are done take 
them up with a skimmer into a wooden bowl or tray, 
and mash them fine with a potato beetle; melt a piece 
of butterj the size of a large egg, into half a pint of hot 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 109 

milk; mix it with the mashed potatoes until it is thor- 
oaghly incorporated, and a smooth mass ; then put it in a 
deep dish, smooth the top over, and mark it neatly with 
a knife; pat pepper over and serve. The quantity of 
milk used must be in proportion to the quantity of po- 
tatoes. 

Mashed potatoes may be heaped on a flat dish; 
make it in a crown or pineapple; stick a sprig of green 
celery or parsley in the top; or first brown it before the 
fire or in an oven. 

Mashed potatoes may be made a highly ornamental 
dish; after shapins; it, as taste may direct, trim the edge 
of the plate with a wreath of celery leaves or green pars- 
ley; or first brown the outside in an oven or before the 
fire. 

FRIED POTATOES. 

Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices as nearly 
the same^iae as possible, make some butter or dripping 
-quite horin a frying pan, put in the potatoes and Iry 
them on both sides to a nice brown ; when they are crisp 
and done take them up, place them on a cloth before the 
fire to drain the grease from them, and serve very hot, 
after sprinkling them with salt. . These are delicious with 
rump steak, and in France are frequently served thus as 
a breakfast dish. The remains of cold potatoes may also 
be sliced and fried by the above recipe, but the slices 
must be cut a little thicker. 

BROILED POTATOES. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes in slices lengthwise quarter 
of ai> inch thick, dip each slice in wheat flour md lay

them on a gridiron over a bright fire of coals; when both 
sides are browned nicely, take them on a hot dish, put a 
bit of butter, pepper and salt to taste over, and serve hot 

POTATOES AND CREAM. 

Mince cold boiled potatoes fine, put them into a spi- 
der with melted butter in it, let them fry a little in the 
butter, well covered, then put in a fresh piece of butter, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and pour over cream or 
rich milk; let it boil up once and serve. 

POTATO PUFFS. 

Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potato. 
While hot shape in balls about the size of an egg; have 
a tin sheet well buttered and place the balls on it. As 
soon as all^are done, brush over with beaten egg; brown 
in the oven. When done, slip a knife under them and 
slide them upon a hot platter. Garnish with parsley 
and serve immediately. 

POTATO SNOW. 

Choose large white potatoes as free from spots as 
possible, boil them in their skin in salt water until per- 
fectly tender, drain and dry them thoroughly by the side 
of the fire and peel them. Put a hot dish before the 
fire, rub the potatoes through a coarse sieve on to this 
dish; do not touch them afterward or the fiakes will fall, 
and serve as hot as possible. 

POTATO BORDER.

one of salt, half a cnpfnl of boiling milk. Pare, boil 
and mash the potatoes. When fine and light add the 
bntter, salt and pepper and two well-beaten eggs. But- 
ter the border mold and pack the potato in it. Let this 
stand on the kitchen table ten minntes, then tnm out on 
a dish and brush over with one well-beaten egg. Brown 
in the oven. 

WHIPPED POTATOES 

Instead of mashing in the ordinary way, whip with 
a fork until light and dry, then whip in a little melted 
butter, some milk, and salt to taste, whipping rapidly 
until creamy. Pile as lightly and irregularly as yon can 
in a hot dish. 

SCALLOPED POTATOES. 

Prepare in this proportion: Two cups of mashed 
potatoes, two tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, and one 
of melted bntter; salt and pepper to taste. Stir the po- 
tatoes, bntter, and cream together, adding one raw egg. 
If the potatoes seem too moist, beat in a few fine bread- 
crumbs. Bake in a hot oven for ten minutes, taking care 
to have the top a rich brown. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. 

Pare, boil, and mash six good sized potatoes. Add 
one tablespoonfnl of butter, two-thirds of a enpful of hot 
cream or milk, the whites of two eggs well beaten, salt 
tad pepper to taste. When cool enough to handle, work 



112 THE EVSlEtl>Alr COOS BOOK. 

into shape, roll in eggs and bread-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. 

POTATOES A LA CREME. 

Heat a cupful of milk; stir in a heaping tablespoon- 
ful of butter cut up in as much flour. Stir until smooth 
and thick; pepper and salt, and add two cnpfnla of cold 
boiled potatoes, sliced, and a little very finely-chopped 
parsley. ■ Shake over the fire until the potatoes are hot 
all through, and pour into a deep dish. 

TO BOIL SWEET POTATOES. 

"Wash them perfectly clean, put them into a pot or 
Btewpan, and pour boiling water over to cover them; 
cover the pot close, and boil fast for half an hour, or more 
if the potatoes are large; try them with a fork; when 
do^e, drain off the water, take off the skins, and serve. 

Cold sweet potatoes may be cut in slices across or 
lengthwise, and fried or broiled as common potatoes; or 
they may be cut in half and served cold. 

ROASTED SWEET POTATOES. 

Having washed them clean, and wiped them dry, 
roast them on a hot hearth as directed for common pota- 
toes; or put them in a Dutch oven or tin reflector. 
Boasted or baked potatoes should not be cut, but broken 
open and eaten from the skin, as from ar shell. 

TO BAKE SWEET POTATOES. 

Wash them perfectly clean, wipe them dry, and bake 
in a quick oven, according to their size — ^half an hour for

THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. nS 

quite small size, three-quarters for larger, and a f ul' /lour 
for the largest. Let the oven have a good heat, aud do 
not open it, unless it is necessary to turn them, until 
they are done. 

FRENCH FRIED SWEET POTATOES. 

Prepare and fry the same as the white potatoes. Oi 
they can first be boiled half an hour, and then pared, 
cut and fried as directed. The latter is the better way, 
as they are liable to be a little hard if fried when raw. 

TURNIPS. 

Boil until tender; mash and season with butter, 
pepper, salt, and a little rich milk or cream. 

SPINACH. 

An excellent way to serve spinach is to first look it 
over carefully; wash it in two or three waters. If the 
stalks are not perfectly tender, cut the leaves from the 
stalk. Boil for twenty minutes in water with enough 
Bait dissolved in it to salt the spinach sufficiently. When 
done let it drain, then chop it fine, put it on the stove in 
a saucepan, with a lump of butter, salt, and pepper, and 
enough milk to moisten it. When the butter is melted 
and spinach steaming, take from the fire and put it in 
the dish in which it is going to the table. Garnish with 
hard-boiled eggs cut in slices or in rings — that is, with 
the yolk removed and rings of the white only left. 

BEETS. 
Clem these nicely, but do not pare them, leaving on 



114 tffE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

a short piece of the stalk. Then put over to boil in hot 
water. Young beets will cook tender in an hour; old 
beets require several hours' boiling. When done, skin 
quickly while»hot, slice thin into your vegetable dish, 
put on salt, pepper, and a little butter, put over a little 
vinegar, and serve hot or cold. 

TO PRESERVE VEGETABLES FOR WIN- 
TER USE. 

Green string beans must be picked when young; 
put a Jayer three inches deep in a small wooden keg or 
half barrel; sprinkle in salt an inch deep, then put an- 
other layer of bean's, then salt, and beans and salt in al- 
ternate layers, until you have enough; let the last be 
salt; cover them with a piece of board which will fit the 
inside of the barrel or keg, and place a heavy weight 
upon it; they will make a brine. 

When vfanted for use, soak them one night tir more 
in plenty of water, changing it once or twice, until the 
salt is out of them, then cnt them, and boil the same as 
when fresh. 

Carrots, beans, beet-roots, parsnips, and potatoes 
keep best in dry sand or earth in a cellar; turnips keep 
best on a cellar bottom, or they may be kept the same 
as carrots, etc. Whatever earth remains about them 
when taken from the ,ground, should not be taken off. 

When sprouts come on potatoes or other stored 
vegetables, they should be carefully cut off. The young 
sprouts from turnips are sometimes served as a salad, 
or boiled tender in salt and water, and served with but- 
ter and pepper over. 

Celery may be kept all winter by setting it in boses 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 116 

filled with earth; keep it in the cellar; it will jrow aad 
whiten in the dark; leeks may also be kept in this way. 

Cabbage set out in earth, in a good cellar, will keep 
good and fresh all winter. Small close heads of cabbage 
may be kept many weeks by taking them before the 
frost comes, and laying them on a stone floor; this will 
whiten them, and make them tender. 

Store onions are to be strung, and huBfr ia a dry, 
cold place. 

DELICATE CABBAG-E. 

Bemove all defective leaves, quarter and cut as for 
coarse slaw, cover well with cold water, and let remain 
several hours before cooking, then drain and put into 
pot with enough boiling water to cover; boil until 
thoroughly cooked (which will generally require about 
forty-five minutes), add salt ten or fifteen minutes before 
removing from fire, and when done, take up into a colan- 
der, press out the water well, and season with butter and 
pepper. This is a good dish to serve with corned meats, 
but should not be cooked with them ; if preferred, how- 
ever, it may be seasoned by adding some of the liquor 
and fat from thd boiling meat to the cabbage while cook- 
ing. Drain, remove, and serve in a dish with drawn 
butter or a cream dressing poured over it. 

RED CABBAGE. 

Select two small, solid heads of hard red cabbage, 
divide them in halves from crown to stem, lay the split 
side down, and cut downward in thin slices. The cab- 
bage will tbeo be in narrow strips or shreds. Pat into » 



116 THE ETBEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

saucepan a tablespoonfnl of clean drippings, butter, or 
any nice fat; when fat is hot, put in cabbage, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, three tablespoonf nls of vinegar (if the latter is 
very strong use but two) and one onion in which three or 
four cloves have been stuck, buried in the middle; boil 
two hours and a half; it it becomes too dry and is in 
danger of scorching, add a very little water. This is 
very nice. 

CAULIFLOWER 

Boil a fine cauliflower tied up snugly in coarse tarla- 
tan, in hot water, a little salt. Drain and lay in a deep 
dish, flower uppermost. Heat a cup of milk, thicken 
with two tablespoonfuls of butter cut into bits and rolled 
in flour; add pepper, salt, the beaten white of an egg, 
and boil up one minute, stirring well. Take from the 
fire, squeeze the juice of a lemon through a hair sieve 
into the sauce and pour half into a boat, the rest over 
the cauliflower. 

MASHED CARROTS. 

Scrape, wash, lay in cold water half an hour, then 
cook tender in boiling water; drain well, mash with a 
wooden spoon or beetle, work in a good piece of butter, 
and season with pepper and salt. Heap up in a vegeta- 
ble dish, and serve very hot. 

BOILED G-REEN CORN. 

Choose young sugar-corn, full grown, but not hard; 
test with the nail. When the grain is pierced the milk 
should escape in a jet and not be thick. Clean by strip- 



in 

pinif 00 VbB outer leaves, torn Isadc Hie inoermoet cover- 
ing caref ally, pick off every thread of silk and re-cover 
the ear with the thin husk that grew nearest it. Tie at 
the top with a bit of thread, put in boiling water salted, 
and cook fast from twenty minutes to half an hour, in 
proportion to size and age. Gut oS the stalks close to 
the cob and send whole to table wrapped in a napkin. 
Or you can cut from the cob while hot and season 
with butter, pepper and salt. Send to table in a vegeta- 
ble dish. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Shell and lay in cold water fifteen minutes. Cook 
from twenty to twenty-five minutes in boiling salted 
water. Drain, put into a deep dish with a good lump of 
butter, pepper and salt to taste. 

TO BOIL ONIONS. 
Take off the tops and tails and the thin outer skin, 
but no more, lest the onions should go to pieces. Lay 
them on the bottom of a pan which is broad enough to 
contain them without piling one on another; just cover 
them with water and let them simmer slowly till they 
are tender all through, but not till they break. Sarve 
them up with melted butter. 

FRIED ONIONS. 
Cut them in thin, slices and season them; have a 
piece of fat bacon frying to get the juice, take it out and 
put the onions in and stir until a pretty brown. 

BOILED PARSNIPS. 
Wash the parsnips, scrape them thoroughly, and.

them, and should they be very large cut the thick part 
into quarters; put them into a saucepan of boiling water, 
salted in the above proportion, boil them rapidly until 
tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork 
into them ; take them up, drain them and serve in a veg- 
etable dish. This vegetable is usually served with salt 
fish, boiled pork or boiled beef; when sent to table with 
the latter, a few should be placed alternately with car- 
rots round the dish as a garnish. 

PARSNIPS FRIED IN BUTTER. 

Scrape the parsnips and boil gently forty-five min- 
utes. When cold, cut in long slices about one-third of an 
inch thick. Season with salt and pepper. Dip in melt- 
ed butter and in fiour. Have two tablespoonfuls of butter 
in the frying-pan, and as soon as hot, put in enough 
parsnips to cover the bottom. Fry brown on both sides 
•and serve on a hot dish. 

CREAMED PARSNIPS. 

Boil tender, scrape and slice lengthwise. Put over 
tie fire with two tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper, and 
salt, and a little minced parsley. Shake until the mix- 
ture boils. Dish the parsnips, add to the sauce three 
tablespoonfuls of cream in which has been stirred a quar- 
ter spoonful of flour. Boil once and pour over the 
parsnips. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 

Boil four or five parsnips; when tender, take off the

skin and mash them fine; add to them a teaepoonful of 
wheat flour and a beaten egg; put a tablespoonfal of 
lard or beef drippings in a frying-pan over the fire, add 
to it a saltspoonful of salt; when boiling hot, put in the 
parsnips, make it in small cakes with a spoon ; when one 
side is a delicate brown, turn the other; when both are 
done, take them on a dish, put a very little of the fat ip 
which they were fried over, and serve hot. These re 
semble very nearly the taste of the salsify or oystei 
plant, and will generally be preferred. 

SALSIFY, OR VEG-ETABIiE OYSTER. 

Boil and serve as directed for parsnips, either 
plain boiled, or fried, or made fritters. 

ROILED VEGETABLE MARROW. 

■ Have ready a Ba,ucepan of boiling water, properly 
salted; put in the marrows after peeling them, and boil 
them until quite tender. Take them up with a slice; 
halve, and; should they be very large, quarter them. 
Dish them on toast, and send to table with them a tureen 
of melted butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of salt 
butter. Large vegetable marrows maybe preserved 
throughout the winter by storing them in a dry place: 
when wanted for use, a few slices should be out and 
boiled in the same manner as above; but, when once be- 
gun, the marrow must be eaten quickly, as it keeps but 
a short time after it is cut. Yegetable marrows are also 
very delicious mashed; they should be boiled, then 
drained, and mashed smoothly with a wooden spoon. 
Heat them in in a saucepan, add a seasoning of salt and

pepper, and a small piece of butter, and dish with a tew 
snippets of toasted bread placed round as a garnish. 

Vegetable marrows are delightful when sliced and 
fried for ten minutes in butter. Before being fried they 
may be dipped-in a batter of flour and water, seasoned 
with a little salt. Vegetable marrows may also be 
dressed as follows: Boil one, and when it is about ready, 
cut it in pieces, which place in a fresh saucepan, cov- 
ered with soup stock, either white or brown ; add a little 
salt in stewing. Serve in a deep dish when thoroughly 
Jender. Vegetable marrows are very nice plain boiled, 
and served upon buttered toast. Peel them and cut 
them so as to be able to remove the seeds. Marrows 
will take from twenty minutes to an hour to boil, accord- 
ing to size and age, After being parboiled, th^ymay be 
sliced down, dipped in egg, and then rubbed among 
bread-crumbs and fried; serve them as hot as possible. 

Tomatoes may be sliced thin and served with salt, 
pepper and vinegar over, for breakfast; or sliced^ and 
strewn with sugar and grated nutmeg for tea; for dinner 
they may be stewed or broiled, or baked. 

Tomatoes may be preserved in sugar, or as catsup, 
when out of season. Such as like them declare them to 
be equally excellent in each and every form or dressing. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Pour boiling water over six or eight large tomatoes, 
or a greater number of smaller ones; let them remain 
for a few minutes, then peel off the skins, squeeze out the 
seeds, and some of the juice, by pressing them gently in 
the hand; put them in a well-tinned stewpan, with a tea- 
spoonful of ^alt, a saltspopi^fol of pepper, a bit o^ butter, 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 121 

half as large as an egg, and a tablespoonful of grated 
bread or rolled crackers; cover the stewpan close, and set 
it over the fire for nearly an hour; shake the stewpan 
occasionally, that they may not burn; serve hot. 

This is decidedly the best manner of stewing toma- 
toes; they may be done without the bread-crumbs, and 
with less stewing if prefered. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Wash five or six smooth tomatoes; cut a piece from 
the stem end, the size of a twenty -five cent piece; put a 
ealtspoonfnl of salt, half as much pepper, and a bit <<f 
butter the size of a nutmeg in each ; set them in a dith 
or pan, and bake in a moderate oven for nearly one hour. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Twelve large, smooth tomatoes, one teaspoonf ul of 
salt, a little pepper, one tablespoonful d biiH(r, one of 
sugar, one cupful of bread-crumbs, one ic ispoonfui of 
onion-juice. Arrange the tomatoes in .i li.iking pan. 
Cut a thin slice from the smooth end i f i-.cli. With a 
small spoon scoop out as much of the ]iulp and juice as 
possible without injuring the shape. When all have 
been treated in this way, mix the pulp and juice v ' 
the other ingredients, and fill the tomatoes with this 
mixture. Put on the tops, and bake slowly three-quar- 
ters of an hour. Slide the cake turner under the tomatoes 
and lift gently on to a flat dish. Garnish with parsley, 
and serve. 

SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

Tom nearly all the juice off from a can of toma-

toes. Salt and pepper this, by the way, and put aside in 
a cool place for some other day's soup. Put a layer of 
bread-crumbs in the bottom of a buttered pie-dish; on 
them one of tomatoes; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and 
some bits of butter, also a little sugar. Another layer 
of crumbs, another of tomatbes — seasoned — then a top 
layer of very fine, dry crumbs. Bake covered until bub- 
bling hot, and brown quickly. 

TO PEEL TOMATOES. 

Put the tomatoes in a frying basket and plunge 
them into boiling water for about three minutes. Drain 
and peel. 

BAKED BEANS. 

Pick one quart of beans free from stones and dirt. 
Wash and soak in cold water over night. In the morn- 
ing pour off the water; cover with hot water; put two 
pounds of corned beef with them and boil until they be- 
gin to split open (the time depends upon the age of the 
beans, but it will be from thirty to sixty minutes); turn 
them into^the colander and pour over them two or three 
quarts of cold water. Put about half of the beans in a 
deep earthen pot, then put in the beef, and finally the 
remainder of the beans. Mix one teaspoonful of mustard 
and one tablespoonful of molasses with a little water; 
pour this over the beans and then add boiling water to 
just cover. Bake slowly ten hours. Add a little water 
occasionally. 

STRING- BEANS. 
String, snap and wash two -quarts beans, boil in 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. ' 12* 

plenty of water about fifteen minutes, drain off and put 
on again in about two quarts of boiling water; boil an 
hour and a half, and add salt and pepper just before 
taMng up, stirring in one and a halt tablespoonp butter, 
rubbed into two tablespoons flour and half pint sweet 
cream. Or boil a piece of salted pork, one hour, then 
add beans and boil an hour and a half. For shelled beans 
boil half an hour in water enough to cover, and dress as 
above. 

BUTTER BEANS. 

With a knife cut off the ends of pods and strings 
from both sides, being very careful to remove every shred ; 
cut every bean lengthwise, in two or three strips, and 
leave them for half an hour in cold water. Much more 
than cover them with boiling water; boil till perfectly 
tender. It is well to allow three hours for boiling. Grain 
well, return to kettle, and add a dressing of half a gill of 
cream, one and a half ounces of butter, one even tea- 
spoon of salt, and half a teaspoon of pepper. This is 
BuflBcient for a quart of cooked beans. 

ASPARAGUS WITH EG-G-S. 

Boil a bunch of asparagus twenty minutes ; cut off 
the tender tops and lay in a deep pie-plate, buttering, 
salting, and peppering well. Beat four eggs just enough 
to break up the yolks, add a tablespoonful of melted but- 
ter, vnth pepper and salt, and pour upon the asparagus. 
Bake eight minutes in a quick oven, and serve immedi- 
ately. 

ASPARAGUS UPON TOAST. 

Tie the bunch of asparagus up with soft string, when 



124 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 

you have cut away the wood, and cook about twenty-five 
minutes in salted boiling water. Have ready some slices 
of cruatless toast; dip each in the asparagus liquor; but- 
ter well while hot and lay upon a heated dish. Drain 
the asparagus, and arrange upon the toast. Pepper, salt, 
and butter generously. 

MUSHROOMS, STEWED. 

If fresh let them lie in salt and water about an hour, 
then put them in the stewpan, cover with water and let 
them cook two hours gently. Dress them with cream, 
butter and flour as oysters, and season to taste. 

MUSHROOMS, FRIED. 

When peeled put them into hot butter and let them 
heat thoroughly through — ^too much cooking toughens 
them. Season well with butter, pepper and salt. Serve 
on buttered toast; a teaspoon of wine or vinegar on each 
mushroom is a choice method. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS. 

Place some large flat ones nicely cleaned and 
trimmed on thin slices of weU-buttered toast, putting a 
little nudgel of butter in each, as also a snuff of pepper 
and salt; lay them on a baking-tray, and cover them 
carefully; heap the hoi ashes upon them, and let them 
bake on the hearth for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS.

MASHED SQUASH. 

Feel, seed and slice fresh summer squasnes. Lay in 
cold water ten minutes; pnt into boiling water, a Uttle 
salt, and cook tender. Twenty minutes will suffice if the 
eqnash be young. Mash in a colander, pressing out all 
the water; heap in a deep dish, seasoning with pepper, 
ealt and bntter. Serve hot. 



BAKED SQUASH. 

Ont in pieces, scrape well, bake fr(/m one to one and 
a half honrs, according to the thickness of the squash; 
to be eaten with salt and bntter as sweet potatoes. 

FRIED SQUASH. 

Out the squash into thin slices, and sprinkle it with 
salt; let it stand a few moments; then beat two eggs, 
and dip the squash into the egg; then fry it brown in 
bntter. 

STEWED CELERY 

Is an excellent winter dish, and is very easily cooked. 
Wash the stalks thoroughly, and boil in well -salted water 
till tender, which will be in about twenty minutes. Af- 
ter it is made ready as above, drain it thoroughly, place it 
on toasted bread, and pour over it a quantity of sauoe. 
A sauce of cream, seasoned with a little mace, may be 



136 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

served over the celery. It may also be served Tntb 
melted butter. 

STUFFED EGG-PLANT. 

Cut the egg-plant in two; scrape out all the inside 
and put it in a sanoepan with a little minced ham ; cover 
with water and boil with salt; drain off the water; add 
two tablespoonfnls grated crumbs, tablespoonfnl butter, 
half a minced onion, salt aud pepper; stuff each half of 
the hull with the mixture; add a small lump of butter 
to each, and bake fifteen minutes.

SAUCES FOR MEATS, FISH. 
POULTRY OR VEGETABLES. 



TO MAKE DRAWN BUTTER. 

Pat half a pint of milk in a perfectly clean stew- 
pan, and set it over a moderate fire; pnt into a pint bowl 
a heaping tablespoonfnl of wheat flour, quarter of 8 
ponnd of sweet bntter, and a saltspoonfnl of salt; work 
these well together with the back of a spoon, then pour 
into it, stirring it all the time, half a pint of boiling wa* 
ter; when it is smooth, stir it into the boiling milk, let 
it simmer for five minntes or more, and it is done. 

Drawn bntter made after this redpe will be found 
to be most excellent; it may be made less rich by nsing 
less bntter. 

PARSLE7 SAUCE.

parsley into boiling water, then cat it fine^ and stir into 
the drewn batter a few minntes before taking it np. 

EGO SAUCE.

quite fine, the white and yolk separately, and stir it int^ 
the Bance before serving. This is used for boiled fish oi 
vegetables. 

ONION SAUCE. 

Peel some nice white onions, and boil them tender; 
press the water from them ; chop them fine, and put 
them to a half pint of hot milk; add a bit of butter, and 
a teaspoonful of salt, and pepper to taste. Serve with 
boiled veal, or poultry, or mutton. 

ANCHOVY SAUCE. 

A 
Make the butter sauce, and stir into it four table- 

Bpoonfuls of essence of anchovy and one of lemon-juice. 
BREAD SAUCE. 

One pint milk, one cup bread-crumbs (very fine), 
one onion, sliced, a ^inch of mace, pepper and salt to 
taste, three tablespoonfuls butter. Simmer the sliced 
onion in the milk until tender; strain the milk and pour 
over the bread-crumbs, which should be put into a sauce- 
pan. Cover and soak half an hour;- beat smooth with 
an egg- whip, add the seasoning and butter; stir in well, 
boil up once, and serve in a tureen. If it is too thick, 
add boiling water and more butter. 

This sauce is for roast poultry. Some people add 
some ot the gravy from the dripping-pan, first straining 
it and beating it well in with the sauce. 

TOMATO SAUCE. 
Can be cheaply made either from the fresh truit or from 



THE EVISRYDAY COOK BOOK. 12ft 

the canned tomatoes, which are on sale in every grocer's 
shop. Squeeze as much as you require through a sieve, 
and then simmer slowly for a little time in a few table- 
spoonfuls of beef gravy, season with pepper and salt. 
Excellent for chops and cutlets, or for roasted beef. 

TOMATO MUSTABD. 

One peck of ripe tomatoes; boiled with two onions, 
six red peppers, four cloves of garlic, for one hour; then 
add a half pint or half pound salt, three tablespoons 
black pepper, half ounce ginger, half ounce alspice, 
half ounce mace, half ounce cloves; then boil again for 
one hour longer, and when coH add one pint of vinegar 
and a quarter pound of mustard; and if you like it very 
hot, a tablespoonfnl of Cayenne. 

MINT SAUCE. 
Mix one tablespoon of white sugar to half a teacup 
of good vinegar; add the mint and let it infuse for half 
an hour in a cool place before sending to the table. 
Serve with roast lamb or mutton. 

CELERY SAUCE. 
Mix two tablespoons of flour with half a teacup of 
butter; have ready a pint of boiling milk; stir the 
flour and butter into the milk; take three heads of cel- 
ery, cut into small bits, and boil for a few minutes in 
water, which strain off; put the celery into the melted 
butter, and keep stirred over the fire for five or ten min- 
utes. This is very nice with boiled fowl or turkey. 

GOVERNOR'S SAUCE.

peppers, one teacup grated horseradish, one teaspoon 
Cayenne and one of black pepper, one teaspoon mustard, 
half cup sugar; slice the tomatoes and sprinkle one tea- 
cup salt on, and lay all night; drain well in the morn- 
ing, then simmer all together till cooked through. 

CREAM SAUCE. 

One' cupful of milk, a teaspoonml of flour and a 
tablespoonf ul of butter, salt and pepper. Put the butter 
in a small frying-pan, and when hot, but not brown, add 
the flour. Stir until smooth; then gradually add the 
milk. Let it boil up once. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper, and serve. This is nice to cut cold potatoes in- 
to and let them jnst heat through. They are then 
creamed potatoes. It also answers as a sauce for other 
vegetables, omelets, fish and sweetbreads, or, indeed, for 
anything that requires a white sauce. It you have plen- 
ty .of cream, use it, and omit the butter. 

RUSSIAN SAUCE. 

I 
(Piquant) may be thus made: Grated horseradish, four 
tablespoonfuls, weak mustard, one spoonful, sugar, half 
a spoonful, a little salt, two or three grains of Cayenne, 
and a spoonful or two of vinegar. Mix thoroughly, and 
serve to cold meat. When wanted for fish, let it be 
added to melted Ijutter — two parts of butter to one of 
sauce. 

MAYONNAISE SAUCK

mustard, one of salt, and one and a half of vinegar; beat 



THE EVERrDAY COOK BOOK. 1^1 

in the yolk of a raw egg, then add very gradually halt a 
pint pure olive oil (or melted butter), beating briskly all 
the time. The mixture will become a very thick batter. 
Flavor with vinegar or fresh lemon-juice. Closely cov- 
ered, it will keep fo? weeks in a cold place, and is 
deli(3iouB. 

OYSTEB SAUOE. 

Take a pint of oysters and save out a little of their 
liquor; put them, with their remaining liquor and some 
mace and nutmeg, into a covered saucepan and simmer 
them on hot coals about ten minutes; then drain them. 
Oysters for sauce should be large. Having prepared in 
a saucepan some drawn or melted butter (mixed with 
oyster liquid instead of water), pour it into a sauceboat, 
add the oysters to it and serve it up with boiled poultry 
or with boiled fresh fish. Celery, first boiled and then 
chopped, is an improvement to oyster sauce. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Put the coral and spawn of a boiled lobster into a 
mortar with a tablespoonful of butter, pound it to a 
smooth mass, then rub it through a sieve; melt nearly a 
quarter of a pound of sweet butter, with a wineglass of 
water or vinegar, add a teaspoonf ul of made mustard, 
stir in the coral and spawn and a little salt and pepper, 
stir it until it is smooth, and serve. Some of the meat 
of the lobster may be chopped fiiie and stirred into it. 

CAPER SAUCE. 
Make a batter sauce, and stir into it one tablespoon- 



132 THE EVERYDAY COOK EOOK. 

lul of lemon juice, two of capers and one ol essence ol 
anchovy. 

MUSTARD SAUCE. 

Stir three tablespoonfuls of mixed mustard and a 
speck of Cayenne into a butter sauce. This is nice for 
devilled turkey and broiled smoked herrings. 

CURRY SAUCE. 

One tablespoonful of butter, one of flour, one tea- 
spoonful of curry powder, one large slice of onion, one 
large cupful of stock, salt and pepper to taste. Cut the 
onion fine and fry brown in the butter; add the flour and 
curry powder; 9tir for one minute, add the stock and 
season with salt and pepper; simmer five minutes, then 
strain and serve. This sauce can be served with a broil 
or saute of meat or fish. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

After removing all soft berries, wash thoroughly; 
place for about two minutes in scalding water, remove, 
and to every pound of fruit add three-quarters of a pound 
of granulated sugar and a half pint water; stew together 
over a moderate but steady fire. Be careful to cover and 
not to stir the fruit, but occasionally shake the vessel, 
or apply a gentler heat if in danger of sticking or burn- 
ing. If attention to these particulars be given, the ber- 
ries will retain their shape to a considerable extent, which 
adds greatly to their appearance on the table. Boil from 
five to seven minutes, remove from fire, turn into a deep 
dish and set aside to cool. If to be kept, they can be put 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 133 

up at once in air-tight jars. Or, for Btralned sauce, one 
and a half pounds of fruit should be stewed in one pint 
of water for ten or twelve minutes, or until quite soft, 
then strained through a colander, or fine wire sieve, and 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar thoroughly stirred 
into the pulp thus obtained; after cooling it is ready for 
use. Serve with roast turkey or game. When to be 
kept for a long time without sealing, more sugar may be 
added, but its too free use impairs the peculiar cranberry 
flavor. For dinner sauce, half a pound is more econo- 
mical, and really preferable to three-quarters, as given 
above. It is better, though not necessary, to use a porce- 
lain kettle. Some prefer not to add the sugar till the 
fruit is almost done, thinking this plan makes it more 
tender, and preserves the color better. 

PORT "WINE SAUCE FOR GAME. 

Half a tumbler of currant jelly, half a tumbler of 
port wine, half a tumbler of stock, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, two tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, four cloves, a 
speck of Cayenne. Simmer the cloves and stock togeth- 
er for half an hour. Strain on the other ingredients, and 
let all melt together. Part of the gravy from the game 
may be added to it. 

CURRANT JELLY SAUCE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of butter, one onion, one bay 
leaf, one sprig of celery, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
half a cupful of currant jelly, one tablespoonful of flour, 
one pint of stock, salt, pepper. Cook the butter and 
onion until the latter begins to color. Add the flower.

and herbs. Stir uqfel '«j'»»w7^ add the stock, and sim- 
mer twenty minutes, i^rain, and skim off all the fat. 
Add the jelly, and stir over the fire until it is melted. 
Serve with game. 

APPLE SAUCE. 

Eeel, quarter, and core, rich tart apples; put to 
them a very little water, cover them, and set them over 
the fire; when tender, mash them smooth, and serve 
with roasted pork, goose, or other gross meat.

BREAD AND BREAKFAST 
CAKES. 



YEAST. 

Put two quarts ot water and two tablespoontuls of 
hops on to boil. Pare and grate six large potatoes. 
When the hops and water boil strain the water on the 
grated potatoes, and stir well. Place on the stove and 
boil up once. Add half a cupful of sugar and one- 
fourth of a cupful of salt. Let the mixture get blood- 
warm ; then add one cupful of yeast, or one cake of com- 
pressed yeast, and let it rise in a warm place five or six 
hours. When well-risen turn into a stone jug. Cork 
this tightly, and set in a cool place. 

PLAIN WHITE FAMILY BREAD. 

Take one pint of flour and halt a pint of good hop 
yeast and stir it together about five o'clock in the after- 
noon; at nine put one-half gallon of flour in a tray, put 
the sponge in the middle of the flour with a piece of 
lard as large as a walnut. Knead it all up with tepid 
water made salt with two teaspoonfuls or more to taste; 
work it well, and put it in a jar to rise. Next morning 



i36 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

knead it over with a little flour; make it in two loaves; 
and set it in a warm place or oven until ready; then put 
it to bake, and when done, wrap it in a nice coarse towel. 
If you have no sugar in the yeast you use, stir a large 
teaspoonful in it before putting it in the flour. 

G-RAHAM BREAD. 

Take a little over a quart of warm water, one-half 
cup brown sugar or molasses, one-fourth cup hop-yeast, 
and one and one-half teaspoons salt; thicken the water 
with unbolted flour to a thin batter; add sugar, salt and 
yeast, and stir in more flour until quite stiff. In the 
morning add a small teaspoon soda, and flour enough to 
make the batter stiff as can be stirred with a spoon, put 
it into pans and let it rise again ; then bake in even oven, 
not too hot at flrst; keef warm -while rising; smooth 
over the loaves with a spoon or knife dipped in water. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD, 

One heaping cofis-cup each of corn, rye and Gra- 
ham meal. The rye meal should be as flne as the Graham, 
or rye flour may be used. Sift the three kinds together 
as closely as possible, and beat together thoroughly with 
two cups New Orleans or Porto Rico molasses, two cups 
sweet milk, one cup sour milk, one dessertspoon soda, 
one teaspoon salt; pour into a tin form, place in a kettle 
of cold water, put on and boil foifr hours. Put on to 
cook as soon as mixed. It may appear to be too thin, 
but it is not, as this recipe has never been known to 
fail. Serve warm, with baked beans or Thanksgiving 
turkey. The bread should not quite fill the form

(or s, tin pail with a cover will answer), as it must have 
room to swell. See that the water does not boil up to 
the top of the form ; also take care it does not boil en- 
tirely away or stop boiling. To serve it, remove the lid 
and set it a few moments into the open oven to dry the 
top, and it will then turn out in perfect shape. This 
bread can be used as a pudding, and served with a sauce 
made of thick, sour cream, well sweatened and seasoned 
with nutmeg, or it is good toasted the next day. 

CORN BREAD. 

Sift three quarts of com meal, add a tablespoonful 
of salt, one teaspoonful baking powder and mix suflScient 
water with it to make a thin batter; cover it with a bread- 
cloth and set it to rise; when ready to bake, stir it well, 
pour it into a baking pan and bake slowly. Use cold 
water in summer and hot water in winter. 

STEAMED BROWN BREAD. 

One quart each of milk and Indian meal, one pint 
rye meal, one cap of molasses, two tablespoonfuls of 
soda; add a little salt and steam four hours. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 

One teacup home-made yeast, a little salt, one table- 
spoon sugar, a piece of lard size of an egg, one pint milk, 
flour sufficient to mix; put the milk on the stove to scald 
with the lard in it; prepare the flour with salt, sugar and 
yeast; then add the milk, not too hot. Knead thoroughly 
when mixed at night; in the morning but very slight 
kneading is necessary. Then roll out and cut with large 



188 THE EVEEYDAST COOK liOOK. 

biscuit cutter. Spread a little butter on each roU and 
lap together. Let them rise very light, then bake in a 
quiclE oven. 

FRENCH ROLLS. 

One pint of milk, scalded; put into it while hot half 
a cup of sugar and one tablespoon of butter. When the 
milk is cool, add a little salt and half a cup of yeast, or 
one compressed yeast cake; stir in flour to make a stiff 
sponge, and, when light, mix as for bread. Let it rise 
until light, punch it down with the hand and let it rise 
again ; repeat two or three times, then turn the dough on 
to the molding-board and pound with the rolling-pin un- 
til thin enough to cut; cut out with a tumbler, brush the 
surface of each one with melted butter, and fold over. 
Let the rolls rise on the tins; bake, and, while warm, 
brush over the surface with melted batter to make the 

crust tender. 

BUNS. 

Break one egg into a cup ana fill with sweet milk; 

mix with it half cup yeast, half cup butter, one cup sugar, 

etough flour to make a soft dough; flavor with nutmeg. 

Let it rise till very light, then mold into buns with 

a few currants. Let rise a second time in pan; bake, 

and when nearly done, glaze with a little molasses and 

milk. Use the same cup, no matter about the size, for 

each measure. 

BISCUIT. 

Diisolve one rounded tablespoon of butter in a pint 
of hot milk; when lukewarm stir in on^ quart of flour, 
and one beaten egg, a little salt, and a teacup of yeast; 
work into dough until smooth. If winter, set in a warm 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 139 

place; if summer, a cool one to rise. In the morning 
work softly and roll out one-half inch and cut into bis- 
cuit and set to rise for thirty minutes, when they will be 
ready to bake. These are delicious. 

TO MAKE RUSKS. 

To every pound of flour add two ounces of butter, 
one-quarter pint of milk, two ounces of loaf sugar, three 
eggs, one tablespoonful of yeast. Put the milk and but- 
ter into a saucepan, and keep shaking it round until the 
latter is melted. Put the flour into a basin with the 
sugar, mix these well together, and beat the eggs. Stir 
them with the yeast to the milk and butter, and with 
this liquid work the flour into a smooth dough. Cover 
a doth over the basin, and leave the dough to rise by the 
side of the fire; then knead it, and divide it into twelve 
pieces; place them in a brisk oven, and bake for about 
twenty minutes. Take the rusks out, break them in half, 
and then set them in the oven to get crisp on the other 
side. When cold, they should be put into tin canisters 
to keep them dry; and, if intended for the cheese course, 
the sifted sugar should be omitted. 

SWEET MILK G-EMS. 

Beat an egg well, add a pint new milk, a little salt, 
and Graham flour until it will drop off the spoon nicely ; 
heat and butter the gem-pans before dropping in the 
dough; bake in a hot oven twenty minutes. 

BREAKFAST GEMS. 
One cup sweet milk, one and a half cups flour, one 



UQ THE EVEETDAT COOK BOOK, 

egg, one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon baking-powder, beaten 
together five minutes ; bake in hot gem-pans in a hot oven 
about fifteen minutes. 

G-RAHAM BREAKFAST CAKES, 

Two cups of Graham flour, one cup of wheat flour, 
rwo eggs well beaten; mix with sweet milk, to make a 
very thin batter; bake in gem-irons; have the irons hot, 
then set them on the upper grate in the oven; will bake 
ia fifteen minutes. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

One quart buckwheat flour; four tablespoonfuls 
yehst; one teaspoonfnl salt; one handful Indian meal; 
two tablespoonfuls molasses — not syrup. Warm water 
enough to make a thin batter. Beat very well and set 
to rise in a warm place. If the batter is in the least sour 
in the morning, stir in a very little soda dissolved in hot 
water. Mix in an earthen crock, and leave some in the 
bottom each morning — a cupful or so — ^to serve as sponge 
for the next night, instead of getting fresh yeast. In 
cold weather this plan can be successfully pursued for a 
week or ten days without setting a new supply. Of 
course you add the usual quantity of flour, etc., every 
night, and beat up well. Do not make your cakes too 
small. Buckwheats should be of generous size. Some 
put t-vo-thirds buckwheat, one-third oat-meal, omitting 
the Indian. 

FLANNEL CAKES. 

Beat six eggs very light, stir in them two pounds of 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK, 141 

flour, one gill of yeast, small spoonful of salt, and suffi- 
cient milk to make a thick batter. Make them at night 
for breakfast, and at ten in the morning for tea. Have 
your griddle hot, grease it well, and bake as buckwheat. 
Butter and send them hot to the table, commencing 
after the family are seated. 

RICE GRIDDLE-CAKES. 

Boil half a cup rice; when cold, mix one quart 
sweet milk, the yolks of four eggs, and flour sufficient to 
make a stiff batter; beat the whites to a froth, stir in 
one teaspoon soda, and two of cream tartar; add a little 
salt, and lastly, the whites of eggs ; bake on a griddle. 
A nice way to serve is to spread them while hot with 
batter, and almost any kind of preserves or jelly; roll 
them up neatly, cut off the ends, sprinkle them with 
sugar, and serve immediately. 

FRENCH PANCAKES. 

Two eggs, two ounces of butter, two ounces of sifted 
sugar, two ounces of flour, half pint of new milk. Beat 
the eggs thoroughly, and put them into a basin with the 
butter, which should be beaten to a cream; stir in the 
sugar and flour, and when these ingredients are well 
mixed, add the milk; keep stirring and beating the mix- 
ture for a few minutes; put it on buttered plates, and 
bake in a quick oven for twenty minutes. Serve with a 
cut lemon and sifted sugar, or pile the pancakes high 
on a dish, with a layer of preserve or marmalade between 

each. 

PANCAKES. 

Two cups ot prepared flour; six eggs; one salt- 



142 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

spoonful of salt; milk to a thin batter. Beat the eggs 
light; add salt, two cups of milk, the whites and flour 
alternately with milk, until the batter is of the right 
consistency. Run a teaspoonful of lard over the bottom 
of a hot frying-pan, pour in a large ladlef ul of batter and 
fry quickly. Roll the pancake up like a sheet of paper; 
lay upon a hoLdish; put in more lard, afid fry another 
pancake. Keep hot over boiling water, sending half a 
dozen to the table at a time. 

BREAD FRITTERS. 

One quart milk — boiling hot; two cups fine bread- 
crumbs; three eggs; one teaspoonful nutmeg; one 
tablespoonful butter — melted ; one saltspoonful salt, and 
the same of soda, dissolved in hot water. Soak the bread 
in the boiling milk ten minutes, in a covered bowl. 
Beat to a smooth paste; add the whipped yolks, the but- 
ter, salt, soda, and finally the whites, whipped stiff. 

QUICK SALLY LUNN. 

One cup of sugar, half cup of butter, stir well to- 
gether, and then add one or two eggs; put in one good 
pint of sweet milk, and, with suflScient flour to make a 
batter about as stiff as cake, put in three teaspoons of 
baking powder; bake and eat hot with butter, for tea or 
breakfast. 

BREAKFAST CAKE. 

One pint of flour, three tablespoons of butter, three 
tablespoons of sugar, one egg, one cup sweet milk, one 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 148 

teaspoon cream tartar, half teaspoon soda; to we eaten 
with bntter. 

QUICK WAFFLES. 

Two pints sweet milk, one cup butter (melted), sifted 
flour to make a soft batter; add the well-beaten yolks of 
six eggs, then the beaten whites, and lastly (just before 
baking) four teaspoons baking powder, beating very hard 
and fast for a few minutes. These are very good with 
four or five eggs, but much better with more. 

JOHNNY CAKE. 

Two-thirds teaspoon soda, three tablespoons sugar, 
one teaspoon cream tartar, one egg, one cup sweet milk, 
six tablespoons Indian meal, three tablespoonfuls flour, 
4nd a little salt. This makes a thin batter. 

MUSH. 

Indian or oatmeal mush is best made in the following 
manner; Put fresh water in a kettle over the fire to boil, 
and put in some salt; when the water boils, stir in hand- 
ful by handful corn or oatmeal until thick enough for 
use. In order to have excellent mush, the meal should 
be allowed to cook well and long as possible while thin, 
and before the final handful is added. When desired 
to be fried for breakfast, turn into an earthen dish and 
set away to cool; then cut in slices when you wish 
to fry; dio each piece in beaten eggs and fry on a hot 
griddle. 

CORN MUSH. 

Pat four quarts ireah water in a kettle to boil, salt 



144 THE EVEBYDAT COOK BOOK. 

to suit Vi}fi taste. When it begins to boil, stir in one and 
a half quarts meal, letting it sift through the fingers 
slowly to prevent lumps, aJding it a little faster at the 
last until as thick as can be conveniently stirred with 
one hand; set in the oven in the kettle (or take out into 
a pan), bake an hour and it will be thoroughly cooked. 
It takes corn meal so long to cook thoroughly that it is 
very diflBcult to boil it until done without burning. Ex- 
cellent for frying -when cold. Use a hard-wood paddle, 
two feet long, with a blade two inches wide and seven 
inches long, to stir with. The thorough cooking and 
baking in oven afterward takes away all the raw taste 
. that mush is apt to have, and adds much to its sweetness 
and delicious flavor. 

G-RAHAM MUSH. 

Sift meal slowly into boiling salted water, stirring 
briskly until it is as thick as can be stirred with one 
hand; serve with milk, or cream and sugar, or butter and 
syrup. It is much improved by removing from the ket- 
tle to a pan, as soon as thoroughly mixed, and steaming 
for three or four hours. It may also be eaten cold, or 
sliced and fried like corn mush.

SALADS, PICKLES, CATSUP. 



LETTUCE. 

The early lettuce, and first fine salad, are five or six 
leaves in a cluster ; their early appearance is their greatest 
recommendation; cabbage or white-heart lettuce is later 
and much more delicate; break the leaves apart one by 
one from the stalk and throw them into a pan of cold 
water; rinse them well, lay them into a salad bowl or a 
deep dish, lay the largest leaves first, put the next size 
upon them, then lay on the finest white leaves; cut hard- 
boiled eggs in slices or quarters and lay them at equal 
distances around the edge and over the salad; serve with 
vinegar, oil, and made mustard in the castor. Or, hav- 
ing picked and washed the lettuce, cut the leaves small; 
put the cut salad in a glass dish or bowl, pour a salad 
dressing over and serve ; or, garnish with small red rad- 
ishes, cut in halves or slices, and hard-boiled eggs cut in 
quarters or slices ; pour a salad dressing over when ready 
to serve. Serve vdth boiled lobster, boiled fowls, or roast- 
ed lamb or veal. 

LETTUCE SALAD.

ing a desertspoon of olive oil or melted butter ^aoe cut- 
ter always when it is difficult to get fresh oil); mix 
thoroughly, and then dilute by adding gradually a tea- 
cup of vinegar, and pour over the lettuce. Garnish by 
slicing another egg and laying oyer £he lettuce. This is 
sufficient for a moderate sized dish of lettuce. 

SALMON SALAD. 

One quart of cooked salmon, two heads of lettuce, 
two tablespoofuls of lemon juice, one of vinegar, two of 
capers, one teaspoonful of- salt, one-third of a teaspoonful 
of pepper, one cupful of mayonnaise dressing, or the 
French dressing. Break up the salmon with two silver 
forks. Add to it the salt, pepper, vinegar and lemon- 
juice. Put in the ice-chest or some other cold place, for 
two or three hours. Prepare the lettuce as directed for 
lobster salad. At serving time, pick out leaves enough 
to border the dish. Cut or tear the remainder in pieces, 
and arrange these in the centre of a flat dish. On them 
heap the salmon lightly, and cover with the dressing, 
Now sprinkle on the capers. Arrange the whole leaves 
at the base; and, if you choose, lay one-fourth of a thin 
slice of lemon on each -leaf. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

Put a large lobster over the fire in boiling water 
slightly salted; boil rapidly for about twenty minutes; 
when done it will be of a bright red color, and should be 
removed, as if boiled too long it will be J;ough; when 
cold, crack the claws, ri ter first disjointing, twist ofiE the 
head (which is used in garnishing), split the body in two 



THE EVEBYDAT COOK BOOK. 14T 

lengthwise, pick ont the meat in bits not too fine, earing 
the coral separate; cut up a large head of lettuce slightly, 
and place on a dish over which lay the lobster, putting 
the coral around the outside. For dressing, take the 
yolks of three eggs, beat well, add four tablespoons salad 
oil, dropping it in very slowly, beating all the time; then 
add a little salt, Cayenne pepper, half teaspoon mixed 
mustard, and two tablespoons vinegar. Pour this over 
the lobster, just before sending to table. 

TOMATO SALAD. 

Take the skin, juice and seeds from nice, fresh to- 
matoes, chop what remains with celery and add a good 
salad-dressing. 

SALAD DRESSING. 

Yolks of two hard-boiled eggs rubbed very fine and 
smooth, one teaspoon English mustard, one of salt, the 
yolks of two raw eggs beaten into the other, dessertspoon 
of fine sugar. Add very fresh sweet oil poured in by 
very small quantities and beaten as long as the mixture 
continues to thicken, then add vinegar till as thin as de- 
sired. If not hot enough with mustard, add a little Cay- 
enne pepper. 

SARDINE SALAD. 

Arrange one quart of any kind of cooked fish on a 
bed of crisp lettuce. Split six sardines, and if there are 
any bones remove them. Cover the fish with the sardine 
dressing. Over this put the sardines, having the ends 
meet in the center of the dish. At the base of the dish 



148 THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. ^ 

make a wreath of thiu slices of lemon; garnish with 
parsley or lettuce, and serve immediately. 

FRENCH SALAD DRESSING. 

Three tablespoonfuls ot oil, one of vinegar, one salt- 
spoonful of salt, one-half a saltspoonful of pepper. Put 
the salt and pepper in a cup and add one tablespoonf ul 
of the oil. When thoroughly mixed, add the remainder 
of the oil and the vinegar. This is dressing enough for a 
salad for six persons. If you like the flavor of onion, 
grate a little juice into the dressing. The juice is 'ob- 
tained by first peeling the onion and then grating with a 
coarse grater, using a good deal of pressure. Two strokes 
will give about two drops of juice. 

CREAM DRESSING- FOR COLD SLAW. 

Two tablespoons whipped sweet cream, two of sugar 
and four of vinegar; beat well and pour over cabbage, 
previously cut very fine and seasoned with salt. 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

Boil one chicken tender; chop moderately fine the 
whites of twelve haud-boiled eggs and the chicken ; add 
equal quantities of chopped celery and cabbage; mash 
the yolks fine, add two tablespoons butter, two of sugar, 
one teaspoon mustard, pepper and salt to taste; and, 
lastly, one-half cup of good cider vinegar; pour over 
the salad and mix thoroughly. If no celery is at hand. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 149 

Use chopped pickled encumbers or lettuce and celery seed. 
This may be mixed two or three days before using. 

RED VEGETABLE SALAD. 

One pint of cold boiled potatoes, one pint of cold 
boiled beets, one pint of uncooked red cabbage, six table- 
spoonfuls of oil, eight of red vinegar (that in which 
beets have been pickled), two teaspoonfuls of salt (unless 
the vegetables have been cooked in salted water), half a 
teaspoonful of pepper. Oat the potatoes in thin slices 
and the beets fine, and slice the cabbage as thin as pos- 
sible. Mix all the ingredients. Let stand in a cold 
place one hour, then serve. Red cabbage and celery may 
be used together. 

CELERY SALAD. 

One boiled egg, one raw egg, one tablespoonful salad 
oil, one teaspoonful white sugar, one saltspoonf al of salt, 
one saltspoon of pepper, four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
one teaspoonful made mustard. Prepare the dressing as 
for tomato salad; cut the celery into bits half an inch 
long, and season. Eat at once, before the vinegar injures 
the crispness of the vegetable. 

COLD SLAW. 

Chop or shred a small white cabbage. Prepare si 
dressing in the proportion of one tablespoonful ot oil to 
four of vinegar, a teaspoonful of made mustard, the 
same quantity of salt and sugar, and half as much pep- 
per. Pour over the salad, adding, if you choose, three 



150 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

tablespoonfuls of minced celery; toss up well and pnt 

into a glass bowl. 

SALAD DRESSING- (Excellent). 

Four eggs, one teaspoonlul of mixed mustard, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of white pepper, half that quantity 
of Cayenne, salt to taste, four tablespoonfulo of cream, 
vinegar. 

Boil the eggs until hard, which will be m about one- 
quarter hour or twenty minutes; put them into cold 
water, take off the shells, and pound the yolks in a mor- 
tar to a smooth paste. Then add all the other ingredients, 
except the vinegar, and stir them well until the whole 
are thoroughly incorporated one with the other. Pour 
in sufficient vinegar to make it of the consistency of 
cream, taking care to add but little at a time. The mix- 
ture will then be ready for use. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERS. 

Wash and wipe six hundred small cucumbers and 
two quaists of peppers. Put them in a tub with one and 
a half cupfuls of salt and a piece of alum as large as an 
egg. Heat to the boiling point three gallons of cider 
vinegar and three pints of water. Add a quarter of a 
pound each of whole cloves, whole alspice and stick cin- 
namon, and two ounces of white mustard seed, and pour 
over the pickles. 

TO PICKLE ONIONS. 

Peel the onions until they are white, scald them in 
strong salt and water, then take them up with a skim- 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 151 

mer; make vinegar enough to cover them, boiling hot; 
strew over the onions whole pepper and white mustard 
eeed, pour the vinegar over to cover them ; when cold, 
put them in wide-mouthed bottles, and cork them close. 
A tablespoonfnl of sweet oil may be put in the bottles 
before the cork. The best sort of onions for pickling are 
the small white buttons. 

PICKLED CAULIFLOWERS. 

Two cauliiiowers, cut up; one pint of small onions, 
three medium-sized red peppers. Dissolve half a pint 
of salt in water enough to cover the vegetables, and let

Heat two quarts of vinegar with four tablespoonfuls of 
mustard, until it boils. Add the vegetables, and boil 
for about fifteen minutes, or until a fork can be thrust 
through the cauliflower. 

RED CABBAO-E. 

Procure a firm good-sized cabbage, and after taking 
off any straggling or soiled leaves, cut it in very narrow 
slices, which, after you sprinkle them well with salt, lay 
aside for forty-eight hoars. Next drain off the salt 
liquor which has formed, and pour over the cabbage a 
well seasoned pickle of boiling hot vinegar; black pep- 
per and ginger are best for seasoning. Cover the pickle 
jars till the cabbage is cold, and then cork. 

TO PICKLE TOMATOES. 

Take the round, smooth green tomatoes, put them 
in salt and water, cover the vessel and put them over the 



162 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

fire to scald; that is, to let the water become boiling hot; 
then set the kettle off; take them from the pot into a 
basin of cold water; to enough cold vinegar to cover 
them, put whole pepper and mustard seed; when the to- 
matoes are cold take them from the water, cut each in 
two across, shake out the seeds and wipe the inside dry 
with a cloth, then put them into glass jars, and cover 
with the vinegar; cork them close or with a close-fitting 
tin cover. 

RIPE TOMATO PICKLES. 

To seven pounds of ripe tomatoes add three pounds 
sugar, one quart vinegar ; boil them together fifteen min- 
utes, skim out the tomatoes and boil the syrup a few 
minutes longer. Spice to suit the taste with cloves and 
cinnamon. 

CHOPPED PICKLE.

THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 158 

two of celery seed, two of alspice, one small box yellow 
mustard, pound brown sugar, one ounce of turmeric; 
slice the tomatoes and let stand over night in brine that 
will bear an egg; then squeeze out brine, chop cabbage, 
onions and beans; chop tomatoes separately, mix with 
the spices, put all in porcelain kettle, cover with vinegar 
and boil three hours. 

PICCALILLI. 

One peck of green tomatoes; (if the flavor of onions 
is desired, take eight, but it is very nice without any); 
four green peppers; slice all, and ]int in layers, sprinkle 
on one cup of salt, and let them remain over night; in 
the morning press dry through a sie\ c, put it in a porce- 
lain kettle and cover with vinegar; add one cup of sugar, 
a tablespoon of each kind of spice; put into a mnslin 
bag; stew slowly about an hour, or until the tomatoes 
are as soft as you desire. 

PICKLED "WALNUTS (Very Good). 

One hundred walnuts, salt and water. To each 
quart of vinegar allow two ounces of whole black pepper, 
one ounce of alspice, one ounce of bruised ginger. Pro- 
cure the walnuts while young; be careful they are not 
woody, and prick them well with a fork; prepare a strong 
brine of salt and water (four pounds of salt to each gal- 
loQ of water), into which put the walnuts, letting them 
remain nine days, and changing the brine every third 
day; drain them ofP, put them on a dish, place it in the 
sun UBtil they become perfectly black, which will be in 
tWQ or three days; have ready dry jars, Into which place 



154 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

the walnuts, and do not quite fill the jars. Boil sufficient 
vinegar to cover them, for ten minutes, with spices in 
the above proportion, and pour it hot over the walnuts, 
which must be quite covered with the pickle ; tie down 
with bladder, and keep in dry place. They will be fit 
for use in a month, and will keep good two or three 
years. 

GREEN TOMATO PICKLE. 

One peck green tomatoes sliced, six large onions 
sliced, one teacup of salt over both; mix thoroughly and 
let it remain over night; pour off liquor in the morning 
and throw it away; mix two quarts of water and one of 
vinegar, and boil twenty minutes; drain and throw

a good boil in just vinegar enough to cover it, adding a 
little alum. Drain again, and when cold, mix in a hall 
pint ground mustard; cover the whole with good cider 
vinegar; add turmeric enough to color, if you like. 

PICKLED MUSHROOMS. 

Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms, to each 
quart of mushrooms, two blades pounded mace, one 
ounce ground pepper; salt to taste. Choose some nice 
young button-mushrooms for pickling, and rub off the 
skin with a piece of flannel and salt, and cut off the 
stalks; if very large, take out the red inside, and reject 
the black ones, as they are too old. Put them in a stew- 
pan, sprinkle salt over them, with pounded mace and 
pepper in the above proportion; shake them well over a 
ciear fire until the liquor flows, and keep them tlicrt- 
until it is all dried up again; then add as much vinegiM 
as will cover them; just let it simmer for one minuh , 
and store it away in stone jars for use. When cold, tie 
down with bladder, and keep in a dry place; they will 
remain good for a length of time, and are generally 
considered delicious. 

FAVORITE PICKLES. 
One quart raw cabbage chopped fine; one quart 



156 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

boiled beets chopped fine; two cups sugar, tablespoon 
salt, one teaspoon black pepper, a quarter teaspoon red 
pepper, one teacup grated horseradish ; cover witt cold

ounces of brown sugar, eight ounces of stoned raisins, 
four ounces of Cayenne, four ounces of powdered ginger, 
two ounces of garlic, two ounces of shalots, three quarts 
of vinegar, one quart of lemon-juice. Chop the apples 
in small square pieces, and add to them the other in- 
gredients. Mix the whole well together, and put in a 
well-covered jar. Keep this in a warm place, and stir 
every day for a month, taking care to put on the lid after 
this operation; strain, but do not squeeze it dry; store it 
away in clean jars or bottles for use, and the liquor will 
^erve as an excellent sauee for meat or fish. 

PICKLED CHERRIES. 
Five pounds of cherries, etoned or OOt; one quart pf 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. J67 

vinegar, two pounds of sugar, one-half ounce of cinna-

jars and they are ready for use. 

SPICED PLUMS. 

Make a syrup, allowing one pound of sugar to one 
of plums, and to every three pounds of sugar a scant 
pint of vinegar. Allow one ounce each of ground cin- 
namon, cloves, mace and alspice to a peck of plums. 
Prick the plums; add the spices to the syrup, and pour, 
boiling, over the plums. Let these stand three days: 
then skim them out and boil down the syrup until it is 
quite thick, and pour hot over the plums in the jar in 
which they are to be kept. Cover closely. 

PEACHES, PEARS and SWEET APPLES. 

For six pounds of fruit use three of sugar, about 
five dozen cloves, and a pint of vinegar. Into each apple,

fore; put the liquor from them to that which was put 
aside, add to it one ounce and a quarter of whole pepper, 
forty cloves, half an ounce of nutmeg sliced and half an 
Ounce of ginger, and boil it for half an hour closely cov- 
ered, then strain it; when cold, bottle it for use. Secure 
the bottles with new corks, and dip them in melted resin. 

MUSHROOM CATSUP. 
To each peck of mushrooms one-half pound salt; to 
each quart of mushroom liquor one-quarter ounce of 
Cayenne, one-half ounce of alspice, one-half ounce of 
ginger, two blades of pounded mace. Choose full-grown

they are picked during a very heavy rain, the catsup 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. IBS 

from which they are made is liable to get musty, and will 
not keep long. Put a layer of them in a deep pan, 
sprinkle salt over them, and then another layer of mush, 
rooms, and so on alternately. Let them remain for a few 
hours, then break them up with the hand. Put them in 
a nice cool place for three days, occasionally stirring and 
mashing them well to extract from them as much juice 
as possible. Now measure the quantity of liquor with- 
out straining, and to each quart allow the above propor- 
tion of spices, etc. Put all into a stone jar, cover it up 
very closely, put it in a saucepan of boiling water, set it 
over the fire and let it boil for three hours. Have ready 
a nice clean stewpan, turn into it the contents of the jar, 
and let the whole simmer very gently for half an hour; 
pour into a jug, where it should stand in a cool place till 
next day, then pour it oft into another jug, and strain it 
into very dry, clean bottles, and do not squeeze the mush- 
rooms. To each pint of catsup add a few drops of brandy. 
Be careful not to shake the contents, but leave all the 
sediment behind in the jug; cork well, and either seal or 
resin the cork so as to perfectly exclude the air. When 
a very clear, bright catsup is wanted, the liquor must be 
strained through a very fine hair-sieve, or flannel bag, 
after it has been very gently poured off. If the opera- 
tion is not successful, it must be repeated until you have 
quite a clear liquor. It should be examined occasionally, 
and if it is spoiling should be reboiled with a few pepper- 
corns. 

BRINE THAT PRESERVES BUTTER 
A YEAR. 

To three gallons of brine strong enough to bear an

egg, add one-quarter pound good loaf-sugar and one 
tablespoonful of saltpetre; boil the brine, and when it 
is cold strain carefully. Pack butter closely in small 
jars, and allow the brine to cover the butter to the depth 
of at least four inches. This completely excludes the 
air. If practicable, make your butter into small rolls, 
wrap each carefully in a clean muslin cloth, tying up 
with a string; place a weight over the butter to keep it 
all submerged in the brine. This mode is most recom- 
mended by those who have tried both. 

BUTTER IN HASTE, 

FROM WINTER CEEAM, OE FKOM THE MILK OF OKE COW. 

Take milk fresh from the cow, strain it into clean 
pans, set it over a gentle fire until it is scalding hot; do 
not let it boil; then set it aside; when it is cold skim off 
the cream. The milk will still be fit for ordinary use. 
When you have enough cream, pnt it into a clean earthen 
basin, beat it with a wooden spoon until the butter is 
made, which will not be long; then take it from the milk 
and work with a little cold water until it is free from 
milk, then drain off the water, put a small tablespoonful 
of fine salt to each pound of butter, and work it in. A 
small teaspoonful of fine white sugar, worked in with 
the salt, will be found an improvement — sugar is a great 
preservative. Make the butter in a roll; cover with a 
bit of muslin, and keep it in a cool place. 

This recipe was obtained from one who practiced it 
for several winters.

PUDDINGS. 



GENERAL REMARKS, 

All boiled -pudding should be put on in boiling 
•water, which must not be allowed to stop simmering, 
and the pudding must always be covered with the water; 
if requisite the saucepan should be kept filled up. To 
prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from sticking to the 
bottom of the saucepan, place a small plate or saucer 
underneath it, if a mold is used, this precaution is not 
necessary; but care must be taken to keep the pudding 
well covered with water. For dishing a boiled pudding 
as soon as it comes out of the pot, dip it into a basin of 
cold water, and the cloth will then not adhere to it. 
Great expedition is necessary in sending puddings to 
table, as, by standing, they quickly become heavy, batter 
puddings particularly. For baked or boiled puddings, 
the molds, cups, or basins should be always buttered 
before the mixture is put into them, and they should be 
put into the saucepan directly they are filled.

flour, two pounds raisins, seeded, chopped and dredged 
with flour, two pounds currants, picked over carefully 
after they are washed, one-quarter pound citron, shred 
fine, twelve eggs, whites and yolk beaten separately, one 
pint milk, one cup brandy, one half ounce cloves, one- 
half ounce mace, two grated nutmegs. Cream the but- 
ter and sugar, beat in the yolks when you have whipped 
them smooth and light; next put in the milk, then the 
flour, alternately, with the beaten whites, then the brandy 
and spice, lastly the fruit, well dredged with flour. Mix 
all thoroughly, wringont your pudding-cloth in hot water, 
flour well inside, pour in the mixture and boil five hours. 



BOILED BATTER PUDDING. 

Three eggs, one ounce butter, one pint milk, three 
tablespoons flour, a little salt. Put the flour into a basin 
and add sufficient milk to moisten it; carefully rub down 
all the lumps with a spoon, then pour in the remainder 
of the milk and stir in the butter, which should be pre- 
viously melted; keep beating the mixture; add the eggs 
and a pinch of salt, and when the batter is quite smooth, 
put it into a well-buttered basin, tie it down very tightly, 
and put it into boiling water; move the basin about for 
a few minutes after it is put into the water to prevent the 
flour settling in any part, and boil for one and one-quar- 
ter hours. This pudding may also be boiled in a floured 
cloth that has been wetted in hot water; it will then take 
a few minutes less than when boiled in a basin. Send 
these puddings very quickly to table, and serve with 
sweet sauce, wine sauce, stewed fruit, or jam of any kind;

The whites of two eggs and the yolk of one, half a 
' cupful of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla, 
three tablespoonfuls of milk. Beat the whites of the 
eggs to a stiff froth, next, beat in the sugar, and then the 
yolk of the egg and the seasoning. Serve immediately. 
This sauce is for light puddings.

PASTRY. 



VERY GOOD PUPP-PASTB. 

To ever pound of flour allow one pound of butter, 
and not quite one-half pint of water. Carefully weigh 
the flour and butter, and have the exact proportion; 
squeeze the butter well, to extract the water from it, and 
afterwards wring it in a clean cloth, that no moisture 
may remain. Sift the flour; see that it is perfectly dry, 
and proceed in the following manner to make the paste, 
using a very clean paste-board and rolling-pin. Suppos- 
ing the quantity to be one pound of flour, work the whole 
into a smooth paste, with not quite one-half pint of 
water, using a knife to mix it with ; the proportion of 
this latter ingredient must be regulated by the discretion 
of the cook; if too much be added, the paste when 
baked, will be tough. Roll it out until it is of an equal 
thickness of about an inch; break four ounces of the but- 
ter into small pieces; place these on the paste, sift over 
it a little flour, fold it over, roll out again, and put another 
four ounces of butter. Repeat the rolling and buttering 
until the paste has been rolled out four times, or equal 
quantities of flour and butter have been used. Do not 
omit, every time the paste is rolled out, to dredge a little 
flour over that and the rolling-pin, to prevent both from 



180 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

sticking. Handle the paste as lightly as possible, and do 
not press heavily upon it with the rolling-pin. The next 
thing to be considered is the oven, as the baking of 
pastry requires particular attention. Do not put it into 
the oven until it is sufficiently hot to raise the paste; for 
the best prepared paste, if not properly baked, will be 
good for nothing. Brushing the paste as often as rolled 
out, and the pieces of butter placed thereon, with the 
white of an egg, assists it to rise in leaves or flakes. As 
this is the great beauty of puff-paste, it is as well to try 
this method. 

PLAINER PASTE. 

One pound of flour, a little more for rolling-pin and 
board, and half a pound of butter and half a pound of 
lard. Cut the butter and lard through the flour (which 
should be sifted), and mix with sufficient ice-water to roll 
easily. Avoid kneading it, and use the hands as little as 
possible in mixing. 

SUET CRUST, FOR PIES OR PUDDINGS 

To every pound of flour allow five or six ounces of 
beef suet, one-half pint of water. Free the suet from 
skin and shreds; chop it extremely fine, and rub it well 
into the flonr; work the whole to a smooth paste with 
the above proportion of water; roll it out, and it is ready 
for use. This crust is quite rich enough lor ordinary 
purposes; but when a better one is desired, use from 
one-half to three-quarters pound of suet to every pound 
of flour. Some cooks, lor rich crusts, pound the suet in 
a mortar, with a small quantity of butter. It should then 



THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. 181 

be laid on the paste in small pieces, the same as ior puflf- 
crust, aod wiU be found exceedingly nice for hot tarts. 
Five ounces of suet to every pound of flour will make a 
very good crust; and even one-quarter pound will answer 
very well for children, or where the crust is wanted very 
plain. 

TO ICE PASTRY. 

To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted 
for fruit tarts and sweet dishes of pastry, put the white 
of an-egg on a plate, and with the blade of a knife beat 
it to a stiff froth. When the pastry is nearly baked, 
brush it over with this, and sift over some pounded sugar; 
put it back into the oven to set a glaze, and in a few min- 
utes it will be done. Great care should be taken that 
the paste does not catch or burn in the oven, which it is 
very liable to do alter the icing is laid on. 

TO GLAZE PASTRY. 

To glaze pastry, which is the usual method adopted 
for meat or raised pies, break an egg, separate the yolk 
from the white, and beat the former for a short time. 
Then, when the pastry is nearly baked, take it out of the 
oven, brush it over with this beaten yolk of an egg, and 
put it back in the oven to set the glaze. 

MINCE-MEAT. 

Take five or six pounds scraggy beef — a neck piece 
will do — and put to boil in water enough to cover it; 
take off the scum that rises when it reaches the boiling 
point, add hot water from time to time until it is tender, 



188 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

then remoTe tlie lid from the pot, salt, let boil till almost 
dry, turning the meat over occasionally in the liquor; 
take from the fire and let stand over night to get thor- 
oughly cold; pick bones, gristle or stringy bits from the 
meat, chop very fine^ mincing at the same time three 
pounds of nice beef suet; seed and cut four pounds 
raisins, wash and dry four pounds currants, slice thin a 
pound of citron, chop fine foar quarts good cooking, tart 
apples; put into a large pan together, add two ounces 
cinnamon, one of cloves, one of ginger, four nutmegs, 
the juice and grated rind of two lemons, one tablespoon 
salt, one teaspoon pepper and two pounds sugar. Put in 
a porcelain kettle one quart boiled cider, or, better still, 
one quart currant or grape juice (canned when grapes are 
turning from green to purple), one quart nice molasses 
or syrup, also a good lump of butter; let it come to boil- 
ing point, and pour over the ingredients in the pan after 
having first mixed them well, then mix again thoroughly. 
Pack in jars and put in a cool place, and, when cold, pour 
molasses over the top an eighth of an inch in thickness, 
and cover tightly. This will keep two months. For baking, 
take some out of the jar; if not moist enough, add a little 
hot water, and strew a few whcJe raisins over each pie. In- 
stead of boiled beef, a beef's heart or roast meat may 
be used, and a good proportion for a few pies is one- 
third chopped meat and two-thirds apples, with a little 
suet, raisins, spices, butter and salt. 

MOCK MINCE PIE3. 

One egg, three or four large crackers, or six or eight 
small ones, one half cup of molasses, one-half cup sugar, 
one-half cup vinegar, one-half cup strong tea, one cop 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 188 

chopped raisins, a small piece batter, spice and salt. 
APPLE CUSTARD PIE. 

Peel sour apples and stew until soft and not much 
water is left in them, and rub through a colander. Beat 
three eggs for each pie. Put in proportion of one cup 
butter and one of sugar for three pies. Season with 
nutmeg. 

APPLE MERINGUE PIE. 

Pare, slice, stew and sweeten ripe, tart and juicy 
apples, mash and season with nutmeg (or stew lemon- 
peel with them for flavor), fill crust and bake till done; 
spread over the apple a thick meringue made by whip- 
ping to froth whites of three eggs for each pie, sweeten- 
ing with three tablespoons powdered sugar; flavor with 
vanilla, beat until it will stand alone, and cover pie three- 
quarters of an inch thick. Set back in a quick oven till 
well "set," and eat cold. In their season snbstitnte 
peaches for apples. 

APPLE PIE. 

Stew green or ripe apples, when you have pared and 
cored them. Mash to a smooth compote, sweeten to 
taste, and, while hot, stir in a teaspoon butter for each 
pie. Season with nutmeg. When cool, fill your crust, 
and either cross-bar the top with strips of paste, or bake 
without cover. Eat cold, with powdered sugar strewed 
over it. 

LEMON PIE. 

The juice and rind of one lemcu, two eggs, eight 



184 THE EVEBTDAY CX)OK BOOK. 

beapibr^ ablespoonfnls of sugar^ one small teacnpfnl of 
milk, OH' teaspoonful of corn starch. Mix the corn starch 
with a little of the milk. Put the remainder on the fire, 
and when boiling, stir in the com starch. Boil one min- 
ute. Let this cool, and add the yolks of the eggs, four 
heaping tablespoonfuls of the sugar, and the grated rind 
and juice of the lemon, all well beaten together. Have 
a deep pie-plate lined with pastej and fill with this mix- 
ture. Bake slowly half an hour. Beat the whites of 
the eggs to a stiff froth, and gradually beat into them 
the remainder of the sugar. Cover the pie with this, and 
brown slowly. 

CUSTARD PIE. 

Make a custard of the yolks of three eggs with milk, 
season to the taste; bake it in ordinary crust; put it in 
a quick oven, that the crust may not be heavy, and as 
soon as that is heated remove it to a place in the oven of 
a more moderate heat, that the custard may bake slowly 
and not curdle; when done, beat the whites to a froth; 
add sugar and spread over the top, and return to the oven 
to brown slightly ; small pinch of salt added to a custard 
heightens the flavor; a little soda in the crust prevents it 
from being heavy. Very nice. 

COCOANUT PIE. 

One-half pound grated cocoanut, three-quarters 
pound of white sugar (powdered), six ounces of butter, 
five eggs, the whites only, one glass of white wine, 
two tablespoonfuls rose-water, one tablespoonful of nut- 
meg. Cream the butter and sugar, and when well-mixed, 
beat very light, with the wine and rose water. Add the 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 185 

cocoanut with as little and as light beating as possible; 
finally, whip in the stiffened whites of the eggs with a 
few skillful strokes, and bake at once in open shells. 
Eat cold, with powdered sugar sifted over them. 

LEMON TABTS. 

Mix well together the juice ana grated rind of two 
lemons, two cups of sugar, two eggs, and the crumbs of 
spongecake; beat it all together until smooth; put into 
twelve patty-pans lined with puff-paste, and bake until 
the crust is done. 

PASTRY SANDWICHES. 

Puff-paste, jam of any kind, the white of an egg, 
sifted sugar. 

Boll the paste out thin; put half of it on a baking- 
sheet or tin, and spread equally' over it apricot, green- 
gage, or any preserve that may be preferred. Lay over 
this preserve another thin paste, press the edges together 
all round, and mark the paste in lines with a knife on 
the surface, to show where to cut it when baked. Bake 
from twenty minutes to half an hour; and, a short time 
before being done, take the pastry out of the oven, brush 
it over with the white of an egg, sift over pounded sugar, 
and put it back in the oven to color. When cold, cut into 
strips; pile these on a dish pyramidically, and serve. 
These strips, cut about two inches long, piled in circular 
rows, and a plateful of flavored whipped cream poured 
in the middle, make a very pretty dish. 

CHERRY PIE. 

Line the dish with a good crust and fill with ripe cher- 



188 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

ries, regulating the quantity of sugar you scatter over 
them by their sweetness. Cover and bake. 

Eat cold, with white sugar sifted over the top. 

SQUASH PIE. 

Two teacups of boiled squash, three-fourths teacup 
of brown sugar, three eggs, two tablespoons of molasses, 
one tablespoonful of melted butter, one tablespoonfnl 
of ginger, one teaspoonf ul of cinnamon, two teacups milk 
a little salt. Make two plate pies. 

CBEAM PIE. 

Pour a pint of cream upon a cup and a half pow. 
dered sugar; let stand until the whites of three eggs have 
been beaten to a stiflE froth; add this to the cream, and 
beat up thoroughly ; grate a little nutmog over the mix- 
ture and bake in two pies without uppfjr crusts. 

TARTLETS. 

Puff -paste, the wniteof an egg; pounded sugar. 

Mode: Poll some good puflf-paste out thin, and cut 
it into two and a half inch squares; brush each square 
over with the white of an egg, then fold down the corn- 
ers so that they all meet in the middle of each piece of 
paste; slightly press the two pieces together, brush them 
over with the egg, sift over sugar, and bake in a nice 
quick oven for about a quarter of an hour. When they 
are done, make a little hole in the middle ai the paste, 
and fill it np with apricot jam, marmalade, or red-currant 
jelly. Pile them hig^ in the centre of a dish, on a nap- 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 187 

kin, and garnish with the same preserve the tartlets are 
filled with. 

PEACH PIE. 

Line a pie-tin with puff -paste, fill with pared peaches 
in halves or quarters, well covered with sugar; put on 
upper crust and bake ; or make as above without upper 
crust, bake until done, remove from the oven, and cover 
with a meringue made of the whites of two eggs, beaten 
to a stiff froth with two tablespoons powdered sugar; re- 
turn to oven and brown slightly. Canned peaches may 
be used instead of fresh, in the same way. 

TABT SHELLS. 

EoU out thin a nice puff-paste, cut out with a 
glass or biscuit cutter, with a wine-glass or smaller cup 
cut out the centre of two out of three of these, lay the 
rings thus made on the third, and bake immediately; or 
shells may be made by lining patty-pans with paste. If 
the paste is light, the shell will be fine, and may be used 
for tarts or oyster patties. Filled with jelly and covered 
with meringue (tablespoonful sugar to white of one egg) 
and browned in oven, they are very nice to serve for tea. 

PUMPKIN PIE. 

One quart of stewed pumpkin, pressed through a 
sieve; nine eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately; two 
scant quarts of milk, one teaspoonful of mace, one tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, and the same of nutmeg; one and 
a half cnps of white sugar, or very light brown. Beat 



188 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

all well together, and bake in crust without cover. 

MINCE PIES. 

Three pounds of raisins, stone and chop them a lit- 
tle; three pounds of currants, three pounds of sugar, 
three pounds of suet chopped very fine, two ounces 
of candied lemon-peel, two ounces of candied orange-peel, 
six large apples grated, one ounce of cinnamon, two nut- 
megs, the juice of three '.crcois and the rinds grated, and 
half a pint of brandy, i xcelient.

CAKES. 



WHITE LADY-CAKE. 

Beat the whites of eight eggs to a high froth, add 
gradually a pound of white sugar finely ground, beat 
quarter of a pound of butter to a cream, add a teacup of 
sweet milk with a small teaspoonful of powdered vola- 
tile salts of salaratus dissolved in it; put the eggs to but- 
ter and milk, add as much sifted wheat flour as will 
make it as thick as pound-cake mixture, and a teaspoon 
of orange-flower water or lemon extract, then add a 
quarter oi a pound of shelled almonds blanched and 
beaten to a paste with a little white of egg; beat the 
whole together until light and white; line a square tin 
pac with buttered paper, put in the mixture an inch deep, 
ani bake half an hour in a quick oven. When done 
take it trom the pan ; when cold take the paper oif , turn 
it upside down on the bottom of the pan and ice the side 
which was down; when the icing is nearly hard, mark 
it in slices the width of a finger and two inches and a 
half long. 

MACAROONS. 

One-half pound of sweet almonds, one-half pound of 
sifted loaf sugar, the whites of Hi>ce eggs, waferpaper. 



190 THE EVEETDAr COOK BOOK. 

Blanch, skin, and dry the almonds and pound them well 
with a little orange-flower water or plain water; then add 
to them the sifted sugar and the whites of the eggs, 
which should be beaten to a stiff froth, and mix all the 
ingredients well together. When the paste looks soft, 
drop it at equal distances from a biscuit syringe on to 
sheets of wafer-paper; put a strip of almond on the top 
of each ; strew some sugar over, and bake the macaroons 
in rather a slow oven, of a light brown color. When 
hard and set, they are done, and must not be allowed to 
get very brown, as that would spoil their appearance. If 
the cakes when baked .appear heavy, add a little more 
white of egg, but let this always be well whisked before 
it is added to the other ingredients. We have given a 
recipe for making these cakes, but we think it almost or 
quite as economical to purchase such articles as these at 
a good confectioners. 

ALMOND ICING-, 

Whites of four eggs, one pound sweet almonds, one 
pound powdered sugar, a little rose water. Blanch the 
almonds by pouring boiling water over them and strip- 
ping off the skins. When dry, pound them to a paste, a 
few at a time, in a Wedgewood mortar, moistening it 
with rose water as you go on. When beaten fine and 
smooth, heat gradually into icing. Put on very thick, 
and when nearly dry cover with plain icing. 

■iX.' MAKE ICING FOR CAKES. 

Beat the whites of two small eggs to a high froth, 
then add to them quarter of a pound of white sugar, 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 191 

ground fine like flour, flavor with lemon extract or va- 
nilla, beat it until it is light and very white, but not quite 
so stiff as kiss mixture; the longer it is beaten the more 
firm it will become. No more sugar must be added to 
make it so. Beat the frosting until it may be spread 
smoothly on the cake. This quantity will ice quite a 
large cake over the top and sides. 

LOAF CAKE. 

One pound of butter beaten to a cream, two pounds 
sugar rolled fine, three pounds of sifted flour, six weU- 
beaten eggs, three teaspoonfuls of powdered salaratus 
dissolved in a little hot water, one tablespoonf ul of ground 
cinnamon and half a nutmeg grated ; add one pound of 
currants well washed and dried, one pound of raisins 
stoned and cut in two; work the whole well together, 
divide it in three loaves, put them in buttered basins and 
bake one hour in a moderate oven. 

RICH BRIDE-CAKE. 

Take four pounds of sifted flour, four pounds of 
sweet, fresh butter, beaten to a cream, and two pounds of 
white powdered sugar; take six eggs for each pound of 
flour, an ounce of ground mace or nutmegs and a table- 
spoonful of lemon extract or orange-flower water. 

LADY FING-ERS. 

Take eight eggs, whip the whites to a firm snow. In 
the meantime have the yolks beaten up with six ounces 
ot powdered sugar. Each ot these operations should be 
performed at least one hour. Then mix all together with 



192 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

eix ounces of silted flour, and when well incorporated 
stir in half a pint of rose or orange-flower water; stir 
them together for some time. 

Have ready some tin plates rubbed with white wax ; 
take a funnel with three or four tubes, fill it with the 
paste and press out the cakes upon the plates to the size 
and length of a finger; grate white sugar over each; let 
them lay until the sugar melts, and they shine; then put 
them in a moderate oven until they have a fine color; 
when cool take them from the tins and lay them together 
in couples by the backs. These cakes may be formed 
with a spoon on sheets of writing paper. Half this quan- 
tity will be trouble enough at one time. 

QUEEN CAKE. 

Beat one pound of butter to a cream, with a table- 
spoonful of rose-water, then add one pound ot fine white 
sugar, ten eggs beaten very light, and a pound and a 
quarter of sifted flour ; beat the cake well together, then 
add half a pound of shelled almonds, bleached and beaten 
to a paste; butter tin round basins, line them with white 
paper, put in the mixture an ir.ch and a half deep; bake 
one hour in a quick oven. 

CHOCOLATE MACAROONS. 

Put three ounces of plain chocolate in a pan and 
melt on a slow fire; then work it to a thick paste with 
one pound of powdered sugar and the whites of three 
eggs; roll the mixture down to the thickness of about 
one-quarter of an inch; cut it in smf ;', round pieces with 
a paste cutter, either plain or scaUoped; batter a pan 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 193 

slightly and dust it with flour and sugar in equal quan- 
tities; place in it the pieces of paste or mixture, and 
bake in a hot but not quick oven. 

CARAMEL CAKE. 

One cup of butter, two of sugar, s scant cup milk, 
one and a half cups flour, cup corn tbarch, whites of 
seven eggs, three teaspoons baking powaer in the flour; 
bake in a long pan. Take half pound brown sugar, scant 
quarter pound chocolate, half cup milk, batter size of 
an egg, two teaspoons vanilla; mix thoroughly and cook 
as syrup until stift enough to spread; spreac. on cake and 
set in the oven to dry. 

POUND CAKE. 

One pound of butter, one and a quarter pounds of 
flour, one pound of pounded loaf sugar, one pound of 
currants, nine eggs, two ounces of candied peel, one-lia}f 
ounce of citron, one-half ounce of sweet almonds; when 
liked, a little pounded mace. Work the butter to a 
cream, dredge in the flour, add the sugar, currants, can- 
died peel (which should be cut into neat slices) and the 
almonds (which should be blanched and chopped), and 
mix all these well together. "Whisk the eggs and let 
them be thoroughly blended with the dry ingredients. 
Beat the cake well for twenty minutes and put it into a 
round tin lined at the bottom and sides with a strip of 
white, buttered paper ; bake it from one and one-half to 
two hours, and let the oven be well heated when the cake 
is first put in ; as, if this is not the case, the currants 
will all sink to the bottom of it. To make this prepara- 



194 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

tion light, the yolks and whites of the eggs should be 
beaten separately and added separately to the other in- 
gredients. A glass of wine is added to the mixture; but 
this is scarcely necessary, as the cake will be found quite 
rich enough without it. 

COCOANUT SPONGE CAKE. 

Beat the yolks of six eggs with half a pound of 
eugar and a quarter of a pound of flour, add a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a teaspoonful of lemon essence and half a 
nutmeg grated ; beat the whites of the eggs to a froth 
and stir them to the yolks, etc., and the white meat of a 
coccanut, grated; line square tin pane with buttered 
paper, and, having stirred the ingredients well together, 
put the mixture in an inch deep in the pans ; bake in a 
qujck oven half an hour; cut it in squares to serve with 
or without icing. 

COCOANUT POUND CAKE. 

Eeat half a pound of butter to a cream ; add grad- 
;ially a pound of sifted flour, one pound of powdered 
sugar, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, a pinch of salt, 
a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel, quarter of a pound 
of prepared cocoanut, four well-beaten eggs, and a cupful 
of milk; mix thoroughly; butter the tins, and line them 
with buttered paper; pour the mixture in to the depth 
of an inch and a half, and bake in a good oven. When 
baked take out, spread icing over them, and return the 
cake to the oven a moment to dry the icing. 

COCOANUT CUP CAKE. 

• Two cups of sugar, two cups of butter, one cup of 



tHE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 19» 

milk, one teaspoonful of essence of lemon, half a nutmeg 
grated, four well-beaten eggs and the white meat of a 
cocoanut grated; nse as much sifted wheat flour as will 
make a rather stiff batter; beat it well, butter square tin 
pans, line them with white paper, and put in the mixture 
an inch deep; bake in a moderate oven half an hour, or 
it may require ten minutes longer. When cold, cut in 
smaJ squares or diamonds; this is a rich cake and is 
much improved by a thin icing. This cake should be 
nidde with fine white sugar. 

COCOANUT DROPS. 

Break a cocoanut in pieces, and lay it in cold water, 
then cut off the dark rind, and grate the white meat on a 
coarse grater; put the whites of four eggs with half a 
pound of powdered white sugar; beat it until it is light 
and white, then add to it a tablespoonf ul of lemon extract, 
and gradually as much grated cocoanut as will make it 
as thick as can be stirred easily with a spoon; lay it in 
heaps the size of a large nutmeg on sheets of white paper, 
place them the distance of half an inch apart; when the 
paper is full, lay it on a baking-tin, set them in a quick 
oven ; when they begin to look yellowish, they are done ; 
let them remain on the paper until nearly cold, then take 
them off with a thin-bladed knife. 

CITRON HEART CAKES. 

Beat half a pound ot butter to a cream, take six eggs, 
beat the whites to a froth, and the yolks with half a 
pound of sugar, and rather more than half a pound of 
sifted flour, beat these well together, add a wineglass of 



196 THE EVEEYDAT COOK BOOK 

brandy, and quarter of a pound ot citron cut in thin slips, 
bake it in small, heart-shaped tins or a square tin pan 
rubbed over with a bit of sponge dipped in melted but- 
ter; put the mixture in half an inch deep; bake fifteen 
or twenty minutes in a quick oven. These are very fine 
cakes. Shred almonds may be used instead of citron. 

IMPERIAL CAKE. 

One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar, four eggs, half a pound of 
currants well washed and dredged, half a teaspoonful of 
soda dissolved in hot water, half a lemon, grated rind 
and juice, one teaspoonful of cinnamon. Drop from a 
spoon upon well -buttered paper lining a baking pan. 
Bake quickly. 

PLUM CAKE. 

Make a cake of two cups of butter, two cups of 
molasses, one cup of sweet milk, two eggs well beaten, 
one teaspoonful of powdered salaratus dissolved with a 
little hot water, one teaspoonful of ground mace or nut- 
meg, one teaspoonful of ground alspice, a tablespoonful 
of cinnamon and a gill of brandy; stir in flour to make 
a batter as stiff as may be stirred easily with a spoon; 
beat it well until it is light, then add two pounds of 
raisins stoned and cut in two, two pounds of currants 
picked, washed and dried, and half a pound of citron cut 
in slips. Bake in a quick oven. This is a fine, rich cake, 
easily made, and not expensive. 

GOLD and SILVER CAKE. 

Gold fart : — Yolks of eight eggs, scant cup butter, 



THE E"\T:RTDAY cook BOOK. 197 

two of sugar, four of flour, one of sour milk, teaspoon 
soda, tablespoon corn starch; flavor with lemon and 
vanilla. 

Silver fart: — Two cups sugar, one of butter, four 
(scant) of flour, one of sour milk, teaspoon soda, table- 
spoon com starch, whites of eight eggs ; flavor with al- 
mond or peach. Put in pan, alternately, one spoonful of 
gold and one of silver. 

TO MAKE SMALL SPONGE CAKES. 

The weight of five eggs in flour, the weight of eight 
in pounded loaf sugar; flavor to taste. Let the flour be 
perfectly dry, and the sugar well pounded and sifted. 
Separate the whites from the yolks ot the eggs, and beat 
the latter up with the sugar; then whisk the whites until 
they become rather stiff, and mix them with the yolks, 
but do not stir them more than is just necessary to min- 
gle the ingredients well together. Dredge in the flour 
by degrees, add the flavoring; butter the tins well, pour 
in the batter, sift a little sugar over the cakes and bake 
them in rather a quick oven, but do not allow them to 
take too much color, as they should be rather pale. Re- 
move them from the tins before they get cold and turn 
them on their faces, where let them remain until quite 
cold, when store them away in a closed tin canister or 
wide-mouthed glass bottle. 

LEMON CHEESE CAKE. 

Two cups sugar, half cup butter, tln-ee-quarters cup 
sweet milk, whites of six eggs, three cups flour, thr6e 
teaspoons baking powder. 



198 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

S* eoE FOB LEMON CHEESE CAKE. — Grated rind and 
juice ot two lemons, yolks of three eggs, half cup but- 
ter, one cup sugar; mix all together and set on stove and 
cook till thick as sponge, stirring all the time; then use 
like jelly between the cakes. 

SNOW CAKE. 

One pound of arrowroot, half pound pounded white 
sugar, half pound butter, the whites of six eggs; flavor- 
ing to taste of essence of almonds, or vanilla, or lemon. 

Mode: — Beat the butter to a cream, stir in the sugar 
and arrowroot gradually, at the same time beating the

DESSERT and TEA DISHES. 



BOILED CUSTARD. 

One quart milk, eight eggs, one-half pound sugar; 
beat to a good froth the eggs and sugar. Put the milk 
in a tin pail and set it in boiling water; pour in the eggs 
and sugar and stir it until it thickens. 

LEMON CUSTARD. 

Beat the yolks of eight eggs till they are white, add 
pint boiling water, the rinds of two lemons grated, and 
the juice sweetened to taste; stir this on the fire till it 
thickens, then add a large glass of rich wine, and one- 
half glass brandy ; give the whole a good boil and put in 
glasses. To be eaten cold. Or, put the thin yellow rind 
of two lemons with the juice of three and sugar to taste 
into one pint of warm water. As lemons vary in size 
and juiciness, the exact quantity of sugar cannot be given. 
Ordinary lemons require three gills. It will be safe to 
begin with that quantity; more may be added if required. 
Beat the whites to a stiff froth, then the yolks; then beat 
both together; pour in gradually while beating the other 
ingredients; put all in a pail, set in a pot of boiling 



210 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

water and stir until thick as boiled custard; straia it in a 
deep dish. When cool, place on ice. Serve in glasses. 

SNOW CUSTARD. 

Half a package of Cox's gelatine, three eggs, two 
cups of sugar, juice of one lemon; soak the gelatine one 
hour in a teacup of cold water, add one pint boiling 
water, stir until thoroughly dissolved, add two-thirds of 
the sugar and the lemon juice; beat the whites of the 
eggs to a stiff froth, and when the gelatine is quite cold 
whip it into the whites, a spoonful at a time, from half 
an hour to an hour. Whip steadily and evenly, and 
when all is stiff pour in a mold, or in a dozen egg-glasses 
previously wet with cold water, and set in a cold place. 
In four or five hours turn into a glass dish. Make a 
custard of one and a half pints milk, yolks of eggs and 
remainder of the sugar ; flavor with vanilla, and when 
the meringue or snow balls are turned out of the mold, 
pour this around the base. 

TAPIOCA PUDDING. 

Three ounces of tapioca, one quart of milk, two 
ounces of butter, quarter of a pound of sugar, four eggs, 
flavoring of vanilla or bitter almonds. Wash the tapi- 
oca and let it stew gently in the milk by the side of the 
stove for quarter of an hour, occasionally stirring it; then 
let it cool; mix with it the butter, sugar and eggs, which 
should be well beaten, and flavor with either of the above 
ingredients. Butter a pie dish and line the edges with 
puff-paste; put in the pudding and bake in a moderate 
oven tor an hour. If the pudding is boiled, add a little 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 211 

more tapioca, and boil it in a buttered basiu one and a 
half hours. 

BLANC-MANGE, 

One quarter pound of sugar, one quart of milk, one 
and a half ounces of isingkss, th« rind of half a lemon, 
four laurel leaves. Put all the ingredients into a lined 
saucepan and boil gently until the isinglass is dissolved; 
taste it occasionally to ascertain when it is sufficiently 
flavored with the laurel leaves; then take them out and 
keep stirring the mixture over the fire for about ten min- 
utes. Strain it through a fine sieve into a jug, and when 
nearly cold pour it into a well-oiled mold, omitting the 
sediment at the bottom. Turn it out caretully on a dish, 
and garnish with preserves, bright jelly or a compote 
of fruit. 

IVORY BLANC-MANGE. 

Soak one ounce of gelatine for ten minutes in a lit- 
tle cold milk and pour over the gelatine, and stir it con- 
stantly until it is all dissolved; it may be placed in the 
dish and set on top of a boiling teakettle for a few min- 
utes; remove it and add a small cupful of sugar and two 
tablespoonfuls of sherry wine. Strain into molds. 

RICE BLANC-MANGE. 

One-quarter pound of ground rice, three ounces of 
loaf sugar, one ounce of fresh butter, one quart of milk, 
flavoring of lemon-peel, essence of almonds or vanilla, or 
laurel leaves. Mix the rice to a smooth batter with 
about one-half pint of milk, and the remainder put into 
a saucepan, with the sugar, butter, and whichever of the 
above flavorings may be preferred; bring the milk to the 



S12 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

boiling point, quickly stir in the rice, and let it boil fo/ 
about ten minutes, or until it comes easily away from the 
saucepan, keeping it well stirred the whole time. Grease 
a mold with pure salad oil; pour in the rice, and let it 
get perfectly set, when it should turn out quite easily; 
garnish it with jam, or pour round a compote of any kind 
of fruit, just before it is sent to table. This blanc-mange 
is better for being made the Jay before it is wanted, as it 
then has time to become firm. If laurel leaves are used 
for flavoring, steep three of them in the milk, and take 
them out before the rice is added ; about eight drops of 
essence of almonds, or from twelve to sixteen drops of 
essence of vanilla, would be required to flavor the above 
proportion of milk. 

APPLE TRIFLE. 

Ten good-sized apples, the rind of one-half lemon, 
six ounces of pounded sugar, one-half pint of milk, one- 
half pint of cream, two eggs, whipped cream. Peel, core, 
and cut the apples into thin slices; and put them into a 
saucepan, with two tablespoonfuls of water, the sugar, 
and minced lemon-rind. Boil all together until quite 
tender, and pulp the apples through a sieve ; if they should 
not be quite sweet enough, add a little more sugar, and 
put them at the bottom of the dish to form a thick layer. 
Stir together the milk, cream and eggs, with a little sugar, 
over the fire; and let the mixture thicken, but do not 
allow it to reach the boiling point. When thick, take it 
off the fire; let it cool a little, then pour it over the 
apples. Whip some cream with sugar, lemon-peel, etc., 
the same as for other trifles; heap it high over the cus- 
tard, and the dish is ready for table. It may be gar- 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 218 

nished, as fancy dictates, with strips of bright apple 
jelly, slices of citron, etc. 

LEMON TRIFLE. 

Juice of two lemons and gi'ated peel of one, one pint 
cream, well sweetened and whipped stiff, one cup of 
sherry, a little nutmeg. Let sugar, lemon-juice and peel 
lie together two hours before you add wine and nutmeg.

the frothed cream. Serve very soon, heaped in small 
glasses. Pass cake with this, as well as with the tea. 

FLOATING ISLAND. 

Take a (|uart of rich cream, and divide it in half. 
Sweeten one pint of it with loaf sugar, and stir it into 
sufficient currant jelly, to color it of a fine pink. I*ut it

almond sponge cake, or lady cake; every slice S]jread 
thickly with raspberry jam or marmalade, and laid evenly 
one on another. Have ready the other jjint of cream, 
flavored with the juice of two lemons, and beaten to a 
stiff froth. Heap it all over the pile of cake so as

whites of ten or a dozen eggs to a froth, and stir into the 
apples, as also some sifted sugar, say a teacupful; stir till 



2U THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK.

glass dish oi" serve in custard cnps, ornamented with 
spots of red currant jelly. 

Thick cream should at table be ladled out to the 
snow. 

TROPICAL SNOW. 

Ten sweet oranges, one cocoanut, pared and grated, 
two glasses sherrj^ one cup powdered sugar, six bananas. 
Peel and cut the oranges small, taking out the seeds. 
Put a layer in a glass bowl and wet with wine, then strew 
with sugar. Next, put a layer of grated cocoanut, slice

to cover them well. Put the creatn into a lined sauce- 
pan, with the sugar and lemon-rind, and let it remain by 
the side of the fire until the CFeam is well-flavored, when 
take out the lemon-rind. Mix the arrowroot smoothly 
with the cold milk; add this to the cream, and let it boil 
gently for about three minutes, keeping it well stirred.

lemon-juice, and pour the whole over the cakes. Gar- 
nish the cream with strips of angelica, or candied citron

omitted, and the mixture ponred over the dry cakes. 

ITALIAN CREAM. 

Take one qnart of cream, one pint of milk sweetened 
very sweet, and highly seasoned witli sherry wine and 
vanilla; beat it with a whip dasher, and rennive the froth

with a cake cutter. Hot lard, strawberry or other jam, 
or jelly, a little boiling milk. Cut the cake carefully and 
fry a nice brown. Dip each slice for a second in a bowl 
of boiling milk; draining this off on the side of the ves- 
sel, lay on a hot dish and spread thickly with strawberry 
jam, peach jelly, or other delicate conserve. Pile tbem 
neatly and send around hot, with cream to pour over 
them. This is a nice way of using stale cake, and if 
rightly prepared the dessert is almost equal to ISTeopolitan 

pudding. 

PEACH MERINGUE. 

Pare and quarter (removing stones) a quart of sound, 
ripe peaches; place them all in a dish that it will not 
injure to set in the oven and yet suitable to place on the 
table. Sprinkle the peaches with sugar, and cover them 
well with the beaten whites of three eggs. Stand the 
dish in the oven until the eggs have become a delicate 
brown, then i-emove, and when cool enough set on a dish 
of ice in a very cool place. Take the yolks of the eggs, 
add to them a pint of milk, sweeten and flavor and boil 
same in a custard kettle, being careful to keep the eggs 
from curdling. When cool, pour into a glass piteher 
and serve with the meringue when ready to use. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Whip one quart rich cream to a stiff troth, and drain 
well on a nice sieve. To one scant pint of milk add six 
eggs beaten very light; make very sweet; flavor high 
with vanilla. Cook over hot water till it is a thick cus- 
tard. Soak one full ounce Cox's gelatine in a very little 
water, and warm over hot water. When the custard is 
very cold, beat in lightly the gelatine and the whipped 



218 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

cream. Line the bottom of your mold with buttered 
paper, the sides with sponge cake or lady-fingers fastened 
together with the white of an egg. Fill with the cream, 
put in a cold place or in summer on ice. To turn out, 
dip the mold for a moment in hot water. In draining 
the whipped cream, all that drips through can be rewhip- 
ped. 

JELLIED GRAPES. 

A very delicate dish is made of one-third of a cup 
of rice, two cups of grapes, half a cup of water, and two 
spoons of sugar. Sprinkle the rice and sugar among the 
grapes, while placing them in a deep dish; pour on the 
water, cover close and simmer two hours slowly in the 
oven. Serve warm as sauce, or cold as pudding. If 
served warm as pudding, increase slightly the proportion 
of rice and sugar. 

JELLY AND CUSTARD. 

One-half package of gelatine, soaked in water enough 
to cover it; when soaked pour one pint of boiling water 
over it, then add one ciip of white sugar and squeeze the 
jnice of one large lemon into it and a little essence of 
lemon and set aside to stiffen. 

Make a custard with a pint and a half of milk, the 
yolks of three eggs, one tablespoonful of corn starch; 
sugar and flavoring. When the jelly is set, and just 
before using, cnt the jelly into squares, laying them in 
layers at intervals in tlie bottom of the dish, then pour 
in Fome ot the cold custard, another layer of jelly, and so 
on until the custard is all used. Beat the whites of the 
egga to a stiff froth, adding two or three teaspoonfuls of 
contectioners' sugar and kj oa in pieces with jelly 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 21?» 

between. All these recipes are better when prepared in 
a tin set inside of another in which there is a little water 
to prevent danger of burning. 

LEMON TOAST. 

Take the yolks of si.x eggs, beat them well and add 
three caps of sweet milk; take bakers' bread not too stale 
and cut into slices; dip them into the milk and eggs, and 
lay the slices into a spider, M'ith sufficient melted butter, 
hot, to try a nice delicate brown; take the whites of six 
eggs, and lieat them to a froth, adding a large cnp of 
white siiirar; add tiie iiiicc of two lemons, lieatinji; well, 
and adding two cnps boiling water. Serve over the toast 
as a sance, and you will find it a very delicious dish. 

DISH OF SNOWWHIPPED CREAM. 

To the whites of three eggs beaten to a froth, add a 
pint of cream and four tablespoonfulsof sweet wine, with 
three of fine white sugar and a teaspoonful of exti-act of 
lemon or vanilla; whip it tn a froth and serve in a glass 
dish; serve jelly or jam with it. Or lay lady-fingers or 
sliced sponge cake in a glass dish, put Pj>oonfuls of jelly 
or jam over, and heap tlio snow upon it. 

OMELET FOR DESSERT. 

Beat six eg^s light, add a teaspoonful of salt, and 
four or five macaroons pounded fine, beat them well 
together; fry as usual; strew jilentifully with sugar, and 
serve. 

JELLY FRITTERS. 

Make a batter of two egge, a pint of milk, and a pint 



220 THE EATERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

bowl of wheat flour or more; beat it light, put a table- 
spoonful of lard or beef fat in a frying or omelet-pan, add 
a saltspoonful of salt, make it boiling hot, put in the 
batter by the large spoonful, not too close; when one 
side is a delicate bi'own, turn the other; when done take 
them on to a dish with a doily over it, put a dessertspoon- 
ful of firm jelly on each, and serve.

PRESERVES, CANNED FRUITS, 
JELLY. 



TO PRESERVE PLUMS WITHOUT THE 
SKINS. 

Pour boiling water over large egg or magnum 
bonum plums, cover them until it is cold, then pull off 
the skins. Make a syrup of a pound of sugar and a tea- 
cup of water for each pound of fruit, make it boiling 
liot and pour it over; let them remain for a day or two, 
then drain it off and boil again; skim it clear and pour 
it hot over plums; let them remain until the next day, 
then put them over the fire in the syrup, boil them very 
gently until clear; take them from the syrup with a skim- 
mer into the pots or jars; boil the syrup until rich and 
thick, take off any scum which may rise, then let it cool 
and settle and poiir it over the plums. If brown sugar 
is used, which is quite as good, except for greengages, 
clarify it as directed. 

TO PRESERVE PURPLE PLUMS. 

Make a syrup of clean brown sugar, clarity it as 
directed in these recipes; when perfectly clear and boil- 
ing hot pour it o\er the plums, having picked out all 
ansound ones and stems, let them remain in the syrup 



222 THE EVI:RTDAY COOK BOOK. 

two days, then drain it off; make it boiling hot, skim it 
and pour it over again ; let them remain another day or 
two, then put them in a preserving kettle over the fire 
and simmer gently until the syrup is reduced and thick 
or rich. One pound of sugar for each pound of plums. 
Small damsons are very fine preserved as cherries or any 
other ripe fruit. Clarify the syrup and when boiling hot 
put in the plums; let them boil very gently until they 
are cooked and the syrup rich. Put them in pots or jars; 
the next day secure as directed. 

PRESERVED G-REENG-AGES TN SYRUP. 

To every pound of fruit allow one pound of loaf- 
sugar, one-quarter pint of water. Boil the sugar and 
water together for about ten minutes; divide the green- 
gages, take out the stones, put the fruit into the syi-up, 
and let it simmer gently until nearly tender. Take it off 
the fire, put it into a large pan, and, the next day, boil it 
up again for about ten minutes with the kernels from 
the stones, which should be blanched. Put the fruit 
carefully into jars, pour over it the sjn'up, and when cold, 
cover down, so that Ihe air is quite excluded. Let the 
syrup be well skimmed both the first and second day of 
boiling, otherwise it will not be clear. 

TO PRESERVE CHERRIES IN SYRUP. 

Four pounds of cherries, three pounds of sugar, one 
pint of white currant-juice. Let the cherries be as clear 
and as transparent as possible, and perfectly ripe; pick 
off the stalks, and remove the stones, damaging the fruit 
as little as you can. Make a syrup with the above pro- 
prtioB of sugar, jnix the cherries with it, and boil theiq 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 223 

for about fifteen minntes, carefully Bkimming them ; turn 
them gently into a pan, and let them remain till the next 
day; then drain the cherries on a sieve, and put the syrup 
and white-currant juice into the preserving-pan again. 
Boil these together until the syrup is somewhat reduced 
and rather thick; then put in the cherries, and let them 
boil for abou''. five minutes; take them off" the fire, sldm 
the syrup, put the cherries into small pots or wide- 
mouthed bottles; pour the syrup over, and when quite 
cold, tie them down carelully, so that the air is quite 
excluded. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

To six pounds of pears, four pounds of sugar, two 
cofi"eecups of water, the juice of two lemons, and the rind 
of one, a handful of whole ginger; boil all together for 
twenty minutes, then put in your pears and boil till solt, 
say about a quarter of an hour; take them out aud boil 
your syrup a little longer; then put back your fruit and 
give it a boil; bottle while hot; add a little cochineal to 
give them a nice color. 

TO PRESERVE PEACHES. 

Peaches for preserving may be ripe but not soft; 
cut them in halves, take out the stones, and pare them 
neatly; take as many pounds ot white sugar as of fruit, 
put to each pound of sugar a teacup of water; stir it until 
it is dissolved, set it over a moderate fire, when it is boil- 
ing hot, put in the peaches, let them boil gently until a 
pure, clear, uniform color; turn those at the bottom to 
the top carefully with a skimmer several times; do not 
hurry them ; when they are clear, take each half up with 
a spoon, and spread the halves on flat dishes to become 



224 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 

cold ; when all are done, let the syrup boil until it is quite 
thick, pour it into a large pitcher, and let it set to cool 
and settle. When the peaches are cold, put them care- 
fully into jars, and pour the fyrup over them, leaving 
any sediment which has settled at the bottom, or strain 
the syrup. Some of the kernels from the peach stones 
may be put in with the peaches while boiling. Let them 
remain open one night, then cover. 

TO PRESERVE CITRON. 

Pare the citrons and cut them into slices about an 
inch and a half thick, then into strips the same thick- 
ness, leaving them the full length of the fruit. Take out 
all the seeds with a small knife, then weigh, and to each 
pound of citron put a pound of white sugar; make a 
syrup; to ten pounds put a pint of water and simmer 
gently for twenty minutes, then put in the citron and 
boil for one hour, or until tender. Before taking off the 
fire put in two lemons sliced thin, seeds taken out, and 
two ounces of root ginger; do not let them boil long 
after the lemon and ginger are put in; do not stir them 
while boiling. The above is very fine if carefully at- 
tended to. 

CRAB-APPLES. 

To each pound of fruit allow half a pound of sugar, 
and a pint of water to three pounds of sugar. When the 
syrup is boiling hot, drop in the apples. They will cook 
very quickly. When done, fill a jar with the fruit, and 
fill it up with syrup. 

PINEAPPLE. 
Pare the fruit, and be sure you take out all the eyes 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 225 

and discolored parts. Cut in slices, and cut the ylicos in 
small bits, taking out the core. Weigh the fruit and put 
in a pan with half as many pounds of siigar as of fruit. 
Let it stand over night. In the morning put it over the 
fire and let it boil rapidly for a minute only, as cooking 
long discolors it. Put it in the jars as directed. 

GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

To every eight pounds of red, rough, ripe gooseber- 
ries allow one (juart of red-currant juice, five pounds o>T 
loaf-sugar. Have the fruit gathered in dry weather au' 
cut off the tops and tails. Prepare one quart of red-cur 
rant juice, the same as for red-currant jelly ; put it into n 
preserving pan with the sugar, and keep stirring until 
the latter is dissolved. Keep it boiling for about ii\e 
minutes; skim well; then put in the gooseberries and 
let them boil from one-half to three-quarters of an hour; 
then turn the whole into an earthen pan and let it remain 
for two days. Boil the jam up again until it looks clear; 
put it into pots, and when cold cover with oiled paper, 
and over the jars put tissue paper brushed over on both 
sides with the white of an egg, and store away in a dry 
place. Care must be taken in making this to keep the 
jam well stirred and well skimmed to prevent it burning 
at the bottom of the pan, and to have it very clear. 

BLACK-CURRANT JAM. 

Pick the currants carefully, and take equal quanti- 
ties of fruit and sugar. Pounded loaf sugar is best. 
Dissolve it over or mix it with the currants. Put in a 



226 THE EVEEYDAT COOK BOOK 

very little water or red-currant juice, boil and skim for 
twenty-five minutes. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

To five or six pounds of fine red raspberries (not too 

ripe) add an equal quantity of the finest quality of white 

sugar. Mash the whole well in a preserving kettle; add 

about one quart of currant juice (a little less will do) and 

boil gently until it jellies upon a cold plate, then put into 

small jars, cover with brandied paper and tie a thick 

white paper over them. Keep in a dark, dry and cool 

place. 

QUINCE PRESERVES. 

Pare, core and quarter your fruit, then weigh it and 
allow an equal quantity of white sugar. Take the par- 
ings and cores and put in a preserving kettle, cover them 
with water and boil for half an hour, then strain through 
a hair sieve and put the juice back into the kettle and 
boil the quinces in it a little at a time until they are ten- 
der; lift out as they are done with a drainer and lay on a 
dish; if the liquid seems scarce add more water. WheQ 
all are done throw in the sugar and allow it to boil ten 
minutes before putting in the quinces; let them boil 
until they change color, say one hour and a quarter, on a 
slow fire. While they are boiling occasionally slip a sil- 
ver spoon under them to see that they do not burn, but 
on no account stir them. Have two fresh lemons cut in 
thin slices, and when the fruit is being put in jars lay a 
slice or two in each. 

RED-CURRANT JELLY. 
Ked-currants; to every pint of juice allow three- 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. a27 

quarter pounds of loaf sugar. Have the fruit gathered 
in fine weather; pick it from the stalks, put it into a 
jar, and place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water 
over the fire, and let it simmer gently until the juice is 
well drawn from the currants ; then strain them through 
a jelly-bag of fine cloth, and, if the jelly is wished very 
clear, do not squeeze them too much, as the skin and 
pulp from the truit will be pressed through with the 
juice, and so make the jelly muddy. Measure the juice, 
and to each pint allow three-quarter pounds of loaf- 
sugar; put these into a preserving-pan, set it over the 
fire, and keep stirring the jelly until it is done, carefully 
removing every particle of scum as it rises, using a 
wooden or silver spoon for the purpose, as metal or iron 
ones would spoil the color of the jelly. When it has 
boiled from twenty minutes to a half hour, put a little 
of the jelly on a plate, and if firm, when cool, it is done. 
Take it off the fire, pour it into small gallipots, cover 
each of the pots with an oiled paper, and then with a 
piece of tissue paper brushed over on both sides with 
the white of an egg. Label the pots, adding the year 
when the jelly was made, and store it away in a dry 
place. A jam may be made with the currants, if they 
are not squeezed too dry, by adding a few fresh rasp- 
berries, and boiling all together with sufficient sugar to 
sweeten it nicely. As this preserve is not worth storing 
away, but is only for immediate eating, a smaller pro- 
portion of sugar than usual will be found enough; it 
answers very well for children's puddings, or f©r a nurs- 
ery preserve. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Apples, water; to every pint of syrup allow three* 



328 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar. Pare and cut the 
apples into pieces, remove the cores, and put them in a 
preserving-pan with sufficient cold water to cover them. 
Let them boil for an hour; then drain the syrup from 
them through a hair sieve or jelly-bag, and measure the 
juice; to every pint allow three-quarters of a pound of 
loaf-sugar, and boil these together for three-quarters of 
an hour, removing every particle of scum as it rises, and 
keep the jelly well stirred, that it may not burn. A lit- 
tle lemon-rind may be boiled with the apples, and a small 
quantity of strained lemon-juice may be put in the jelly 
just before it is done, when the flavor is liked. This 
jelly may be ornamented with preserved greengages, or 
any other preserved fruit, and will turn out very prettily 
for dessert. It should be stored away in small pots. 

BLACK-CURRANT JELLY. 

Pick each currant individually, and heat the lot. 
in a jar set in boiling water, squeeze as before, and allow a 
pint of juice to a pound of sugar, a little water may be 
added if thought proper, or a little red-currant juice. 
Boil for half an hour, carefully removing the skimmings. 
Another way: Clarify the sugar, and add the fruit to it 
whole, boil for twenty minutes, and strain, then boil a 
few minutes additional. Pot it and paper it when cool. 
The refuse berries may be kept as black-currant jam, for 
tarts, dumplings, etc. 

CRAB-APPLE JELLY. 

Wash the fruit clean, put in a kettle, cover with water, 
and boil until thoroughly cooked. Then pour it into a 
sieve, and let it drain. Do not press it through. For 



THE EVERYDAY COOK iiOOK. 229 

each pint of this liquor allow one pouad of sugar. Boil 
/rem twenty minutes to half an hour. 

OTHER JELLIES. 

Jellies can be made from quinces, peaches and apples 
by following the directions for crab-apple jelly. 

WINE JELLY. 

One box of Cox's gelatine, dissolved in one pint of 
cold water, one pint of wine, one quart of boiling water, 
one quart of granulated sugar, and three lemons. 

CALVES' FEET JELLY 

Should be made at any rate the day before it is required. 
It is a simple aflfair to prepare it. Procure a couple of 
feet and put them on the fire in three quarts of water; 
let them boil for five hours, during which keep skim- 
ming. Pass the liquor through a hair sieve into a basin, 
and let it firm, alter which remove all the oil and fat. 
Next take a teacupful of water, two wineglassfuls of 
sherry, the juice of half a dozen lemons and the rind of 
one, the whites and yolks of five eggs, half a pound of 
fine white sugar, and whisk the whole till the sugar is 
melted, then add the jelly, place the whole on the fire in 
an enameled stewpan, and keep actively stirring till the 
composition comes to the boil ; pass it twice through a 
jelly -bag, and then place in the molds. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Allow pound for pound. Pare half the oranges and 
cut the rind into shreds. Boil in three waters until ten- 



280 THE ETERYDAT COOK BOOK. 

der, and set aside. Grate the rind of the remaining 
oranges; take off and throw away every bit of the thick, 
white inner skin ; quarter all the oranges and take out 
the seeds. Chop, or cut them into small pieces; drain 
all the juice that will come away, without pressing them, 
over the sugar; heat this, stirring until the sugar is dis- 
solved, adding a very little water, unless the oranges are 
very juicy. Boil and skim five or six minutes; put in 
the boiled shreds, and cook ten minutes ; then the chop- 
ped fruit and grated peel, and boil twenty minutes lon- 
ger. When cold, put into small jars, tied up with blad- 
der or with paper next the fruit, cloths dipped in wax 
over all. A nicer way still is to put away in tumblers 
with self-adjusting metal tops. Press brandied tissue 
paper down closely to the fruit. 

LEMON MARMALADE. 

Is made as you would prepare orange — allowing a pound 
and a quarter of sugar to a pound of the fruit, and using 
but half the grated peel. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

Gather the fruit when fully ripe ; pare, quarter and 
core it; boil the skins with as many teacupfuls of water 
as you have pounds of quinces ; when they are soft, mash 
them, and strain the water from them, and put it to the 
quinces; boil them until they are soft enough to mash 
them fine; rub them through a sieve; put to the pulp as 
many pounds of sugar; stir them together, and set them 
over a gentle fire, until it will fall from a spoon, like 
jelly; or try some in a saucer. If it jellies when cold, it 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 231 

is enongh. Put it in pots or tumblers, and when cold, 
secure as directed for jelly. 

PEACH MARMALADE. 

Peel ripe peaches, stone them and cut them small ; 
weigh three-quarters of a pound of sugar for each pound 
of cut fruit, and a teacup of water for each pound of 
sugar; set it over the fire; when it boils, skim it clear, 
then put in the peaches, let them boil quite fast ; mash 
them fine and let them boil until the whole is a jellied 
mass and thick, then put it in small jars or tumblers. 
When cold, secure it as directed for jellies. Half a pound 
of sugar for a pound of truit will make nice marmalade. 

APPLE BUTTER. 

Boil one barrel of new cider down half, peel and core 

three bushels of good cooking apples; when the cider 

has boiled to half the quantity, add the apples, and when 

soft stir constantly for from eight to ten hours. If done 

it will adhere to an inverted plate; Put away in stone 

jars (not earthen ware), covering first with writing paper 

cut to fit the jar, and press down closely upon the apple 

butter; cover the whole with thick brown paper snugly 

tied down. 

LEMON BUTTER. 

Beat six eggs, one-fourth pound butter, one pound 
sugar, the rind and juice of three lemons; mix together 
and set in a pan of hot water to cook. Very nice for tarts 
or to eat with bread. 

PEACH BUTTER. 
Take pound for poaud of peacheB aud sugar; cook 



J332 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

peaches alone until they become soft, then put in one- 
half the sugar, and stir for one-half an hour; then the 
remainder ot the sugar, and stir an hour and a half. Sea- 
son with cloves and cinnamon. 

APPLE GINGER. 

(a dessert dish.) 

Two pounds of any kind of hard apples, two pounds 
of l6af sugar, one and one-half pints of water, one ounce 
ot tincture of ginger. Boil the sugar and water until 
they form a rich syrup, adding the ginger when it boils 
up. Pare, core and cut the apples into pieces, dip them 
in cold water to preserve the color, and boil them in the 
syrup until transparent, but be careful not to let them 
break. Put the pieces of apple into jars, pour over the 
syrup, and carefully exclude the air by well covering 
them. It will remain good for some time if kept in a 
dry place. 

ICED CURRANTS. 

One-quarter pint of water, the whites of two eggs, 
currants, pounded sugar. Select very fine bunches of 
red or white currants and well beat the whites of the 
eggs. Mix these with water; then take the currants, a 
bunch at a time, and dip them in; let them drain for a 
minute or two, and roll them in very finely-pounded 
sugar; lay them to dry on paper when the sugar will 
crystallize round each currant and have a very pretty 
effect. All fresh fruit may be prepared in the same 
manner, and a mixture of various fruits iced in this man- 
ner and arranged on opf difsbj Ipoke very we}J for ft ?IW|» 
mv 4e8S?rt. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 238 

TO BOTTLE FRESH FRUIT. 

(VEEY USEFUL IN WINTEK.) 

Fresh fruit, such as currants, raspberries, cherries, 
gooseberries, plums of all kinds, damsons, etc.; wide- 
mouthed glass bottles, new corks to fit them tightly. 
Let the fruit be full grown, but not too ripe, and gathered 
in dry weather. Pick it oft the stalks without bruising 
or breaking the skin, and reject any that is at all blem- 
ished; if gathered in the damp, or if the skins are cut at 
all, the fruit will mold. Have ready some perfectly dry 
glass bottles, and some nice new soft corks or bungs; 
bum a match in each bottle, to exhaust the air, and 
quickly place the fruit in to be preserved; gently cork 
the bottle, and put them into a very cool oven, where let 
them remain until the fruit has shrunk away a fourth 
part. Then take the bottles out, do not open them, but 
immediately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and 
cover them with melted rosin. It kept in a dry place, 
the fruit will remain good for months ; and on this prin- 
cipally depends the success of the preparation, for if 
stored away in a place that is the least damp, the fruit 
will soon spoil. 

TO GREEN FRUIT FOR PRESERVING IN 

SUGAR OR VINEGAR. 

Apples, pears, limes, plums, apricots, etc., for pre- 
serving or pickling, may be greened thus: Put vine- 
leaves under, between, and over the fruit in a preserving- 
kettle; put small bits of alum, the size of a pea, say a 
4o?en bits to a kett|eful j put enough watej- to cover the 



234 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

fruit, cover tfce kettle close to exclude all outer air, set it 
over a gentle fire, let them simmer; when they are ten- 
der drain off the water; if they are not a fine green let 
them heoome cold, then put vine-leaves and a bit of sal- 
eratus or soda with them, and set them over a slow fire 
until they begin to simmer; a bit of soda or saleratusthe 
size of a small nutmeg will have the desired effect; then 
spread them out to coal, after which finish as severally 
directed. 

TO COLOR PRESERVES PINK. 

By pntfeg in with it a little cochineal powdered 
fine, then inlsh in the syrup. 

TO COLOR FRUIT YELLOW. 

Sell the fruit with fresh skin lemons in water to 
cover them, until it is tender; then take it up, spread it 
on dishea to cool, and finish as may be directed. 

CANNED STRAWBERRIES. 

After the berries are pulled, let as many as can be 
put carefully in the preserve kettle at once, be placed on 
a platter. To each pound of fruit add three-fourths of a 
pound of sugar; let them stand two or three hours, till 
the juice is drawn from them ; pour it in the kettle and 
let it come to a boil, and remove the scum which rises; 
then put in the berries very carefully. As soon as they 
come thoroughly to a boil put them in warm jars, and 
seal while boiling hot. £e sure the cans are air-tight. 

CANNED PEACHES. 
Select some fine, free-stone peaches; pare, cut in 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 235 

two and stone them. Immerse in cold water, taking care 
not to break the fruit. See that the peaches are not over 
ripe. Place in the kettle, scattering sugar between the 
layers — the sugar should be in the proportion of a full 
tablespoonful to a quart of fruit. To prevent burning 
put a little water in the kettle. Heat slowly to a boil, 
then boil for three or four minutes. Can and seal the 
fruit. 

CANNED PEARS. 

Prepare and can precisely like peaches in preceding 
recipe, except that they require longer cooking. When 
done they are easily pierced with a silver fork. 

CANNED PLUMS. 

To every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar; for the thin syrup, a quarter of a pound 
of sugar to each pint of water. Select fine friiit, and 
prick with a needle to prevent bursting. Simmer gently 
in a syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and 
water. Let them boil not longer than fire minutes. Put 
the plums in a jar, pour in the hot syrup, and seal. 
Greengages are also delicious done in this manner. 

CANNED CURRANTS. 

Look them over carefully, stem and weigh them, 
allowing a pound of sugar to every one of fruit; put 
them in a kettle, cover, and leave them to heat slowly 
and stew gently for twenty or thirty minutes ; then add 
the sugar, and shake the kettle occasionally to make it 
mix with the fruit; do not allow it to boil, but keep as 
j^ as possible until the sugar is dissolved, then pour it

in cans and secure the covers at once. White currants 
are beautiful preserved in this way. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE. 

For six pounds of fruit when cut and ready to can 
make syrup with two and a half pounds of sugar and 
nearly three pints of water; boil syrup five minutes and 
skim or strain if necessary; then add the fruit, and let 
]t boil up ; have cans hot, fill and shut up as soon as pos- 
sible. Use the best white sugar. As the cans cool keep 
tightening them up. 

TO CAN QUINCES. 

Cut the quinces into thin slices like apples for pies. 

To one quart jarful of quince take a coffee-saucer and a 

half of sugar and a coffee-cup of water; put the sugar 

and watsr on the fire, and when boiling put in the 

quinces ; have ready the jars with their fastenings, stand 

the jars in a pan of boiling water on the stove, and when 

the quince is clear and tender put rapidly into the jars, 

fruit and syrup together. The jars must be filled so 

that the syrup overflows, and fastened up tight as quickly 

as possible. 

CANNING TOMATOES. 

Scald your tciuacoes, remove the skins, cut in small 
pieces, put in a porcelain kettle, salt to taste, and boil 
fifteen minutes; hive tin cans filled with hot water; 
pour the water out and fill with tomatoes; solder tops 
on immediately with shellac and rosin melted together. 

CANNED CORN,

water, and take one tablespoonful to two quarts of sweet 
corn; cook, and while boiling hot, fill the cans, which 
should be tin. When used turn into a colander, rinse 
with cold water, add a little soda and sugar while cook- 
ing, and season with butter, pepper and salt.

ICES, ICE-CREAM, CANDY. 



CURRANT ICE. 

One pint of currant-juice, one pound of sugar, and 
pint of water; put in freezer, and when partly frozen 
add the whites of three eggs well beaten. 

STRAWBERRY AND RASPBERRY ICE. 

One quart of berries. Extract the juice and strain; 
one pint of sugar, dissolved in the juice; one lemon, 
juice only; half pint water. 

ORANGE AND LEMON ICES. 

The rind of three oranges grated and steeped a few 

moments in a little more than a pint of water; strain 

one pint of this on a pound of sugar, and then add one 

pint of orange or lemon-juice; pour in a freezer, and 

when half frozen add the whites of four eggs beaten to 

a stiff froth. 

ICE-CREAM, 

One quart of new milk, two eggs, two tablespoons 
of corn starch; heat the milk in a dish set in hot water, 
then stir in the corn starch mixed smooth in a little of 
the milk; let it boil for one or two minutes, then remove 
from stove and cool, and etir in the egg and liaU a pouod

of sngar. If to be extra nice, add a pint of ricn crearn, 
and one-fourth pound of sugar, strain the mixture and 
when cool add the flavoring and freeze ae follows : Pre- 
pare freezer in the usual manner; turn the crank one 
hundred times, then pour upon the ice and salt a quart 
of boiling water from the tea kettle. Fill up again with 
ice and salt, turn the crank fifty times one way and 
twenty -five the other (which serves to scrape the cream 
from sides of freezer); by this time it will turn very 
hard, indicating that the cream is frozen sufficiently. 

VANILLA OR LEMON ICE-CREAM, 

Take two drachms of vanilla or lemon peel, one 
quart of milk, half a pound of sugar, one pint of cream 
and the yolks of three eggs ; beat the yolks well and stir 
them with the milk, then add the other ingredients; set 
it over a moderate fire and stir it constantly with a sil- 
ver spoon until it is boiling hot, then take out the lemon 
peel or vanilla and when cold freeze it. 

STRAWBERRY ICE-CREAM. 

Sprinkle strawberries with sugar, wash well and rub 
through a sieve; to a pint of the juice add half a pint ot 
good cream; make it very sweet; freeze, and when be- 
ginning to set, stir lightly one pint of cream whipped, 
and lastly a handful of whole strawberries, sweetened. 
It may then be put in a mold and imbedded in ice, or 
kept in the freezer; or mash with a potato pounder is aa 
earthen bowl one quart of strawberries with on* po«nd 
of sugar, rub it through a colander, add one qaart of

canned ones), mix juice with half a pint of cream, sweeten 
and freeze; when partially set, add whipped cream and 
strawberries. 

CHOCOLATE ICE-dREAM. 

Take six ounces of chocolate, a pint of cream, half 
a pint of new milk and half a pint of sugar. Rub the 
chocolate down into the milk and mix thoroughly, add- 
ing the cream and sugar. The milk should be heated 
almost to boiling. Heat until it thickens, stirring con- 
stantly. Strain and set aside to cool, afterwards freeze. 
This makes perhaps the most favorite of ice creams. 

CREAM CANDIES. 

Three and one-half pounds of sugar to one and one- 
half pints of water; dissolve in the water before putting 
with the sugar one-quarter of an ounce of fine white 
gum-arabic, and when added to the sugar put in one tea- 
spoon of cream of tartar. The candy should not be boiled 
quite to the brittle stage. The proper degree can be 
ascertained if, when a small skimmer is put in and taken 
out, when blowing through the holes of the skimmer, 
the melted sugar is forced through in feathery filaments; 
remove from the fire at this point, and rub the syrup 
against the sides of the dish with an iron spoon. If it is 
to be a chocolate candy, add two ounces of chocolate finely 
sifted and such flavoring as you may prefer, vanilla, rolls 
or orange. If you wish to make cocoanut candy, add 
this while soft and stir until cold. 

PINEAPPLE ICE-CREAM. 

Three pints of cream, two large ripe pineapples, two 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 241 

pounds powdered sugar; slice the pineapples thin, scat- 
ter the sugar between the slices, cover and let the fruit 
stand three hours, cut or chop it up in the syrup and 
strain through a hair sieve or double bag of coarse lace; 
beat gradually into the cream, and freeze as rapidly aa 
possible. Reserve a few pieces of pineapple unsugared, 
cut into square bits and stir through cream when half 
frozen, first a pint of well-whipped cream and then the 
fruit. Peach ice-cream may be made in the same way. 

ITALIAN CREAM. 

Put one ounce of soaked isinglass, six ounces of 
loaf-sugar, halt a stick of vanilla, and one pint of milk 
into a saucepan ; boil slowly; and stir all the time until 
the isinglass is dissGlyed; strain the mixture, and 
when a little cool mix with a pint of thick cream. Beat 
thoroughly until it thickens. Pour into large or indi- 
vidual molds, and put in ice-box until wanted. 

TO MAKE BARLEY-SUGAR. 

To every pound of sugar allow one-half pint of 
water, one- half the white of an egg. Put the sugar into 
a well-tinned saucepan, with the water, and when the 
former is dissolved, set it over a moderate fire, adding 
the well-beaten egg before the mixture gets warm, and 
stir it well together. When it boils, remove the scum 
as it rises, and keep it boiling until no more appears, and 
the syrup looks perfectly clear; then strain it through a 
fine sieve or muslin bag, and put it back into the sauce- 
pan. Boil it again like caramel, until it is brittle when 
a little is dropped into a basin of cold water; it is then 
sufficiently boiled. Add a little lemon.juice and a few 



«8 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

drops of the eesence of lemon, and let it stand for a min- 
ute or two. Hare ready a marble slab or large dish rub- 
bed over with salad oil, pour the sugar on it, and cut it 
into strips with a pair of scissors; these strips should 
then be twisted, and the barley-sugar stored away in a 
very dry place. It may be formed into lozenges or drops, 
by dropping th' sugar in a very small quantity at a time 
on to the oiled slab or dish. 

TO MAKE EVERTON TOFFEE. 

One pound of powdered loaf-sugar, one teacnpfnl of 
water, one-quarter pound of butter, six drops of essence 
of lemon. Put the water and sugar into a brass pan, and 
beat the butter to a cream. When the sugar is dissolved, 
add the butter, and keep stirring the mixture over the 
fire until it sets when a little is poured on a buttered 
dish; and just before liie toffee is done add the essence 
of lemon. Butter a dish or tin, pour on it the mixture, 
and when cool it will easily separate trom the dish. But- 
ter-Scotch, an excellent thing for coughs, is made with 
brown, instead of white sugar, omitting the water, and 
flavored with one-half ounce of ginger. It is made in 
the same manner as toflEee. 

COCOANUT DROPa 

To one grated cocoanut add half its weifkt of suga* 
and the white of one egg, cut to a stiff froth; mix 
thoroughly and drop on buttered white papw or tin 
■heete. Bake fifteen minutes. 

MOLASSES CANDY. 

One cap of MolMoai, two imm of eofir, ow iiiki» 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 243 

spoon vinegar, a little butter and vanilla, boil ten minutes, 
then cool it enough to pull. 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 

Two cups of brown sugar, one cup molasses, one cup 
chocolate grated fine, one cup of boiled milk, one table- 
spoon of flour; butter the size of a large English walnut; 
let it boil slowly and pour on flat tins to cool; mark off 
while warm. 

LEMON CANDY. 

Pnt into a kettle three and a half pounds of sugar, 
one and one-half pints of water and one teaspoonful of 
cream of tartar. Let it boil until it becomes brittle 
when dropped in cold water; when sufficiently done, take 
oiF the fire and pour in a shallow dish which has been 
greased with a little butter. When this has cooled so 
that it can be handled, add a teaspoon of tartaric acid 
and the same quantity of extract of lemon, and work 
them into the mass. The acid must be fine and tree 
from lumps. Work this in until evenly distributed, and 
no more, as it will tend to destroy the transparency of 
the candy. This method may be used for preparing all 
other candies, as pineapple, etc., using different flavors. 



244 THE EVEEYDAX" COOK BOOK. 



DRINKS. 



TO MAKE GREEN -TEA. 

Have ready a kettle of water boiling fast, pour eo^iie 
into the teapot, let it remain for a few minutes, then 
throw it out; measure a teaspoonful of tea for each two 
persons, put it in the pot, pour on it about a gill of boil- 
ing water, cover it close for five minutes, then fill it up ; 
have a covered pitcher of boiling water with it ; when two 
cups are poured from it, fill it up; you will thus keep 
the strength good and equal. If the company is large, it 
is best to have some of the tea drawn in the covered 
pitcher, and replenish the teapot or urn when it is 
exhausted. 

TO MAKE BLACK TEA. 

Make as directed for green tea. 

ICED TEA. 

Prepare tea in the morning, making it stronger and 
sweeter than usual; strain and pour into a clean stone 
jug or glass bottle, and set aside in the ice-chest until 
ready to use. Drink from goblets without cream. Serve 
ice broken in small pieces on a platter nicely garnished 
with well-washed grape leaves. Iced tea may be pre- 
pared from either green or black alone, but it is consid- 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK, 245 

ered an improvement to mix the two. Tea made like 
that for iced tea (or that left in the teapot after a meal) 
with sugar to taste, a slice or two of lemon, a little of 
tlie juice, and some pieces of cracked ice, makes a de- 
lightful drink. Serve in glasses. 

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

Take a good-sized cupful of ground coifee, and pour 
into a quart of boiling water, with the white of an egg 
and the crushed shell. Stir M'ell together, adding a half- 
cupful of cold water to clear. Put into the cofPee-hoiler 
and boil for about a quarter of an hour; after standing 
for a little while to settle, pour into yourcoiieepot, which 
should be well scalded, and send to the table. The cuffee 
should be stirred as it boils. To make coffee an lait, take 
a pint each of hot made coffee and boiling milk; strain 
through thin muslin into coffeepot, to get rid of the 
grounds, and serve hot. 

CHOCOLATE. 

Take six tablespoons scraped chocolate, or three of 
chocolate and three of cocoa, dissolve in a quart of boil- 
ing water, boil hard fifteen minutes, add one quart of rich 
milk, let scald and serve hot ; this is enough for six per- 
sons. Cacoa can be made after this recipe. Some boil 
either cocoa or chocolate only one minute and then serve, 
while others make it the day before using, boiling it foi- 
one hour, and when cool skimming off the oil, and when 
wanted for use, heat it to the boiling point and add the 
milk. In this way it is equally good and much more 
wholesome. Cocoa is from the seed of the fruit of a 
small tropical tree. There are several forms in which it 



a4« THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

is sold, the most nutritious and convenient being- cboco- 
late, tli« next cocoa, then cocoa nibs, and last cocoa, shells. 
The ground bean is simply cocoa; ground fine and mixed 
with sugar it is chocolate; the beans broken into bits are 
" nibs." The shells are the shells of the bean, usually 
removed before grinding. The beans are roasted ]ik<" 
coffee, and ground between hot rollers. 

LEMON SYRUP. 

Take the juice of twelve lemons, grate the rind of 
six in it, let it stand over night, then take six pounds of 
white sugar, and make a thick syrup. When it is quite 
cool, strain the juice into it, and squeeze as much oil 
from the grated rind as will suit the taste. A table- 
spoonful in a goblet of water will make a delicious drink 
on a hot day, far superior to that prepared from the stuff 
commonly sold as lemon syrup. 

STRAWBERRY SYRUP. 

Take fine ripe strawberries, crush them in a cloth, 
and press the juice from them; to each pint of it put a 
pint of simple syrup, boil gently for one hour, then let it 
become cold, and bottle it; cork and seal it. When 
served reduce it to taste with water, set it on ice, and 
serve in small tumblers half filled. 

RASPBERRY SYRUP. 
Make as directed for strawberry, 

STRAWBERRY SHERBET. 
Take fourteen ounces of picked strawberries, crush 



THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. 241 

them in a mortar, then add to them a quart of water; 
pour this into a basin, with a lemon sliced, and a tea- 
spoonful of orange-flower water; let it remain for two or 
three hours. Put eighteen ounces of sugar into another 
basin, cover it with a cloth, through which pour the 
strawberry -juice; after as much has run through as will, 
gather up the cloth, and squeeze out as much juice as 
possible from it; when the sugar is all dissolved, strain 
it again; set the vessel containing it on ice, until ready 

to serve. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

To four quarts of red raspberries, put enough vinegar 
to cover, and let them stand twenty-four hours; scald and 
strain it; add a pound of sugar to one pint of juice; boil 
it twenty minutes and bottle; it is then ready for use 
and win keep years. To one glass of water add a great 
spoonful. It is much relished by the sick. Very nice. 

LEMONADE. 

Take half a pound of loaf sugar and reduce it to a 
syrup with one pint of water; add the rind of five lem- 
ons and let stand an hour; remove the rinds and add the 
strained juice of the letoons; add one bottle of "Apol- 
linaris" water, and a block of ice in centre of bowl. 
Peel one lemon and cut it up into thin slices, divide each 
slice in two, and put in lemonade. Claret or fine cor- 
dials may be added if desired. Serve with a piece of 
lemon in each glass. 

EGG-NOG. 

Whip the whites and yolks of six eggs into a stiff 
cream, adding a half cupful of sugar. Pour into a quart 



us THE EVEKYDAY COOK BOOK. 

of rich milk, adding a half pint of good brandy and a 
little flavoring of nutmeg. Stir up and thoroughly mix 
the ingredients and add the whites of three additional 
eggs well whipped. 

RAISIN WINE 

Take two pounds of raisins, seed and chop them, a 
lemon, a pound of white sugar and about two gallons of 
boiling water. Pour into a stone jar and stir daily for 
six or eight days. Strain, bottle, and put in a cool place 
for ten days or so, when the wine will be ready for use. 

CURRANT WINE. 

The currants should be quite ripe. Stem, mash and 
strain them, adding a half pint of water, and less than a 
pound of sugar to a quart of the mashed truit. Stir well 
up together and pour into a clean cask, leaving the bung- 
hole open or covered with a piece of lace. It should 
stand for a month to ferment, when it will be ready for 
bottling. 

GINGER WINE. 

One-half pound of cinnamon bark, four ounces of 
pimento, two ounces of mace, three-quarters of an ounce 
of capsicum, three-quarters of a pouud of ginger root, 
five gallons of alcohol; macerate and strain or filter after 
standing fifteen days. Now make syrup, thirty pounds 
of white sugar, half pound tartaric acid, one and a half 
pounds of cream tartar dissolved with warm water, clar- 
ify with whites of two eggs, and add soft water to make 
forty gallons. Color with cochineal, and let it stand six 
months before use. 



THE EVEKYDAY COOK BOOK. 249 

FINE MILK PUNCH. 

Pare off the yellow rind of four large lemons, and 
steep it for twen*-y-four hours in a quart of brandy or 
rum. Then mix with it the juice of the lemons, a pound 
and a half of loaf sugar, two grated nutmegs and a quart 
of water. Add a quart of rich, unskimmed milk made 
boiling hot, and strain the whole through a jelly-bag. 
Ton may either use it as soon as it is cold, or make a 
larger quantity (in the above proportion), and bottle it. 
It will keep several months. 

CLARET CUP. 

One quart bottle of claret, one bottle of soda water, 
one lemon cut very thin, four tablespoons of powdered 
sugar, quarter of a teaspoon of grated nutmeg, one liquor 
glass of brandy, one wineglass sherry wine. Half an hour 
before it is to be used, put in a large piece of ice, so that 
it may get perfectly cold. 

ROMAN PUNCH. 

Grate the yellow rinds of four lemons and iwo 
oranges upon two pounds of loaf-sugar. Squeeze on the 
juice of the lemoas and oranges; cover it, and let it stand 
till next day. Then strain it through a sieve, add a bot- 
tle of champagne, and the wliites ot eight eggs beaten to 
a froth. You may freeze it or not. 

CREAM NECTAR. 

Dissolve two pounds of crushed sugar in three quarts 
of water; boil down to two quarts; drop in the white of 
aa egg while boiling; then strain, and put in the tartaiic 



250 THE EVERTDAT COOK BOOK. 

acid; when cold drop in the lemon to your taste; then 
bottle and cork. Shake two or three times a day. 

RED-CURRANT CORDIAL. 

To two quarts of red-currants put one quart of whis- 
key ; let it stand twenty-four hours, then bruise and strain 
through a flannel bag. To every two quarts of this 
liquor, add one pound of loaf-sugar, add quarter of a 
pound of ginger well bruised and boiled; let the whole 
stand to settle, then strain or filter; bottle and cork, seal 
the corks tightly. It is an improvement to have half 
red-raspberry juice if the flavor is liked. The above is 
fit for use in a month. 

ELDERBERRY SYRUP. 

Take elderberries perfectly ripe, wash and strain 
them, put a pint of molasses to a pint of the juice, boil 
it twenty minutes, stirring constantly^ when cold add to 
each quart a pint of French brandy; bottle and cork it 
tight. It is an excellent remedy for a cough. 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 251 



INVALID COOKERY. 



PORT WINE JELLT, 

Melt in a little warm water an ounce of isinglass ; 
stir it into a pint of port wine, adding two ounces of 
sugar candy, an ounce of gum-arabic and half a nutmet;- 
grated. Mix all well and boil it ten minutes, or till 
everything is thoroughly dissolved ; then strain it through 
muslin and set it away to get cold. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 

Wash the tapioca carefully in two or three waters, 
then soak it for live or six hours, simmer it then in a 
stewpan until it becomes quite clear, add a little of the 
juice of a lemon, wine if desired. 

ARROWROOT WINE JELLY. 

One cup boiling water, two heaping teaspoons arrow- 
root, two heaping teaspoons white sugar, one tablespoon- 
ful brandy or three tablespoonfuls of wine. An excel- 
lent corrective to weak bowels. 

JELLIED CHICKEN. 
Cook six chickens in a small quantity of water until 
the meat will part from the bone easily; season to taste 
•with salt and pepper. Just as soon as cold enough to 



252 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 

handle, remove bones and skin; place meat in a deep pan 
or mold just as it comes from the bone, using gizzard, 
liver and heart, until the mold is nearly full. To the 
water left in the kettle add three-fourths of a box of 
Cox's gelatine (some add juice ot lemon) dissolved in a 
little wann water, and boil until it is reduced to a little 
less than a quart, pour over the chicken in the mold, 
leave to cool, cut with a very sharp knife and serve. The 
slices will not easily break up if directions are followed. 

CHICKEN BBOTH. 

Half fowl or the inferior joints of a whole one, one 
quart of water, one blade of mace, half onion, a small 
bunch of sweet herbs, salt to taste, ten peppercorns. If 
a young one be used for this broth, the inferior joints 
may be put in the broth, and the best pieces reserved for 
dressing in some other manner. Pat the fowl into a 
saucepan with all the ingredients and simmer gently for 
one and a half hours, carefully skimming the broth well. 
When done, strain and put by in a cool place until 
wanted ; then take all the fat off the top, warm up as 
much as may be required, and serve. This broth is, of 
course, only for those invalids whose stomachs are strong 
enough to digest it, with a flavoring of herbs, etc. It 
may be made in the same manner as beef tea, with water 
and salt only, but the preparation will be but tasteless 
and insipid. When the invalid cannot digest this chicken 
broth with the flavoring, we would recommend plain beef 
tea in preference to plain chicken tea, which it would be 
without the addition of herbs, onions, etc. 
TO MAKE GRUEL. 

One tablespoonful of Robinson's patent groats, 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 253 

two tablespoonfnla of cold water, one pint of boiling 
water. Mix the prepared groats smoothly with the cold 
water in a basin, ponr over them the boiling water, stir- 
ring it all the time. Put it into a very clean saucepan, 
boil the gruel for ten minutes, keeping it well stirred ; 
sweeten to taste and serve. It may be flavored with a 
sma'U piece of lemon peel by boiling it in the gruel, or a 
little grated nutmeg may be put in; but in these matters 
the taste of the patient should be consulted. Pour the 
gruel in a tumbler and serve. When wine is allowed to 
the invalid, two tablespoonfuls of sherry or port make 
this preparation very nice. In case of colds, the same 
quantity of spirits is sometimes added instead of wine. 

BARLEY WATER. 

Pnt a large tablespoonful of well-washed pearl bar- 
ley into a pitcher, pour over it boiling water, cover it and 
let it remain until cold, then drain oif the water, sweeten 
to taste, and, it liked, add the juice of a lemon and grat- 
ed natmeg. 

ARROWROOT BLANC-MANGE. 

Pnt a quart of milk to boil, take an ounce of Ber- 
muda aiTOwroot ground fine, make it a smooth batter with 
cold milk, add a teaspoonful of salt; when the milk is 
boiling hot stir the batter into it, continue to stir it over 
a gentle fire (that it may not be scorched) for three or 
four minutes; sweeten to taste with double refined sugar 
and flavor with lemon extract or orange flour water, or 
boil a stick of cinnamon or vanilla bean in the milk be- 
fore putting in the arrowroot; dip a mold into cold 
water, strain the blanc-mange through a muslin into the 



254 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

mold, when perfectly cold tarn it out; eerve currant jelly 
or jam with it. 

LEMONADE FOR INVALIDa 

One-half a lemon, lump sugar to taste, one pint of 
boiling water. Pare off the rind of the lemon thinly, 
cut the lemon into two or three thick slices and remove 
as much as possible of the white outside pith and all the 
pips. Put the slices of lemon, the peel and lump sugar 
into a jug, pour over the boiling water, cover it closely 
and in two hours it will be fit to drink. It shoald either 
be strained or ponred oS from the sediment. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

Is frequently ordered as a preparation for invalids. For 
the sick-room such broth must be made as plainly as 
possible, and so as to secure the juice of the meat. Boil 
slowly a couple of pounds of lean mutton for two hours, 
skim it very carefully as it simmers, and do not put in 
very much salt. If the doctor permits, some vegetable 
as seasoning may be added, and for some broths a little 
fine barley or rice is added. 

FLAX SEED LEMONADE. 

Four tablespoons fiax seed (whole), one quart boiling 
water poured on the fiax seed, juice of two lemons, leav- 
ing out the peel; sweeten to taste; stew three hours in a 
covered pitcher. If too thick, put in cold water with the 
lemon juice and sugar. Ice for drinking. It is splendid 

for colds. 

ARROWROOT. 

This is very nourishing and light, either for invalids 



TAB EVEBYDAT COOK BOOK. 256 

or infants; make it with milk or water; put a pinf, of 
either into a stewpan, make it boiling hot, add a salt- 
spoonful of Bait, put a heaped teaspoonfnl of ground 
Bermuda aiTowroot into a cup, make it smooth with cold 
milk, stir it into the stewpan and let it simmer for two 
or three minutes; then turn it into a bowl, sweeten and 
grate nutmeg over, if liked ; should it be preferred thin, 
use less arrowroot. This should be made only as much 
as is wanted at a time, since it will become as thin as 
water if heated over. 

STEWED RABBITS IN MILK. 

Two very young rabbits, not nearly half grown; one 
and one-half pints of milk, one blade of mace, one des- 
sertspoonful of flour, a little salt and Cayenne. Mix the 
flour very smoothly with four tablespoonfuls of the milk, 
and when this is well-mixed, add the remainder. Cut up 
the rabbits into joints, put them into a stewpan with the 
milk and other ingredients, and simmer them very ^enilij 
until quite tender. Stir the contents from time to time, 
to keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning. 
Half an hour will be sufficient for the cooking of this 

dish. 

SLIPPERY-ELM BARK TEA. 

Break the bark into bits, pour boiling water over it, 
cover and let it infuse until cold. Sweeten, ice, and take 
for summer disorders, or add lemon-juice and drink for a 
bad cold. 

BEEF TEA. 

One pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces. Pat 
into a jar witboat a drop oi water; cover tightly, and set 



256 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK, 

in a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil, and 
continue this steadily for three or four hours, until the 
meat is like white rags, and the juice all drawn oat. 
Season with salt to taste, and when cold, skim. 

EGG "WINE. 

One egg, one tablespoonful and one-half glass of 
cold water, one glass of sherry, sugar and grated nutmeg 
to taste. Beat the egg, mixing with it a tablespoonful of 
cold water; make the wine and water hot, but not boil- 
ing; pour it on the egg, stirring all the time. Add sufS- 
cient lump sugar to sweeten the mixture, and a little 
grated nutmeg; put all into a very clean saucepan, set it 
on a gentle fire, and stir the contents one way until they 
thicken, but do not allow them to boil. Serve in a glass 
with snippets of toasted bread or plain crisp biscuits. 
"When the egg is not warmed, the mixture will be found 
easier of digestion, but it is not so pleasant a drink. 

TOAST WATER. 

Slices of toast, nicely browned, without a symptom 
of burning. Enough boiling water to cover them. Cover 
closely and let them steep until cold. Strain the water, 
sweeten to taste, and put a piece of ice in each glassful. 

ONION GRUEL. 

Is excellent for cold. Slice down a few onions and boil 
them in a pint of new milk, stir in a sprinkle of oatmeal 
and a very little salt, boil till the onions are quite tender, 
then sup rapidly and go to bed.

OOSMETIQUES. 



COMPLEXION "WASH. 

Put in a vial one drachm of benzoin gum in powder, 
one drachm nutmeg oil, six drops of orange-blossom tea, 
or apple-blossoms put in half pint of rain-water and 
boiled down to one teaspoonful and strained, one pint of 
sherry wine. Bathe the face morning and night; will 
remove all flesh worms and freckles, and give a beautiful 
complexion. Or, put one ounce of powdered gum of 
benzoin in pint of whiskey; to use, put in water in wash- 
bowl till it is milky, allowing it to dry without wiping. 
This is perfectly harmless. 

TO CLEAR A TANNED SKIN. 

"Wash with a solution of carbonate of soda and a lit- 
tle lemon-juice; then with Fuller's earth-water, or the 
juice of unripe grapes. 

OIL. TO MAKE THE HAIR CURL. 

Olive oil, one pound; oil of organum, one drachm; 
oil rosemary, one and one-half drachms. 

"WRINKLES IN THE SKIN. 

White wax, one ounce; strained honey, two ounces;

juice of lily-bulbs, two ounces. The foregoing melted 
and stirred together will remove wrinkles. 

PEARL WATER FOR THE FACE. 

Put half a pound best Windsor soap scraped fine into 
half a gallon of boiling water; stir it well until it cools, 
add a pint of spirits of wine and half an ounce of oil of 
rosemary; stir well. This is a good cosmetique, and 
will remove freckles. 

PEARL DENTIFRICE. 

Prepare chalk, one-half pound; powdered myrrh, 
two ounces; camphor, two drachms ; orris-root powdered, 
two ounces. Moisten the camphor with alcohol and mix 

all well together. 

WASH FOR A BLOTCHED FACE. 

Hose water, three ounces; sulphate of zinc, one 
drachm; mix. Wet the face with it, gently dry it and 
then touch it over with cold cream, which also gently 
dry off. 

FACE POWDER. 

Take of wheat starch, one pound; powdered orris- 
root, three ounces; oil of lemon, thirty drops; oil of 
bergamot, oil of cloves, each fifteen drops. Hub thor- 
oughly together. 

BANDOLINE. 

To one qiiart of rose-water add an ounce and a half 
of gum tragacanth; let it stand forty-eight hours, fre- 
quently straining it, then strain through a coarse linen 
cloth; let it stand two days, and again strain; add to it

a drachm of oil of roses; used by ladies dressing their 
hair, to make it lie in any position. 

A GOOD WASH FOR THE HAIR. 

One pennyworth of borax, half a pint of olive-oil, 
one pint of boiling water. 

Mode : Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil; 
let it cool ; then put the mixture into a bottle. Shake it be- 
foreusing,and apply it withaflannel. Camphor andborax, 
dissolved in boiling water and left to cool, make a very 
good wash for the hair; as also does rosemary water 
mixed with a little borax. After using any of these 
washes, when the hair becomes thoroughly dry, a little 
pomatum or oil should be rubbed in, to make it smooth 
and glossy. 



260 THE EVERYDAY GOOK BOOK. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 



AN EXCELLENT HARD SOAP. 

Pour twelve quarts soft boiling water on two and 
one-half pounds of unslacked lime; dissolve five pounds 
sal soda in twelve quarts soft hot water; then mix and 
let them remain trom twelve to twenty-four hours. Pour 
off all the clear fluid, being careful not to allow any of 
the sediment to run off; boil three and one-half pounds 
clean grease and three or four ounces of resin in the 
above lye till the grease disappears; pour into a box and 
let it stand a day to stiffen and then cut in bars. It is 
as well to put the lime in all the water and then add the 
soda. After pouring off the fluid, add two or three gal- 
lons of water and let it stand with the lime and soda 
dregs a day or two. This makes an excellent washing 
fluid to boil or soak the clothes in, with one pint in a 
boiler of water. 

TO WASH WOOLEN BLANKETS. 

Dissolve soap enough to make a good suds in boil- 
ing water, add a tablespoon of aq a ammonia; when 
scalding hot, turn over your blankets. If convenient, 
use a pounder, or any way to work th-^roughly through 
the suds without rubbing on a board. Einse well in hot 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. -iOi 

water. There is nsucilly soap enough from the first suds 
to make the second soft; if not, add a little soap and 
ammonia ; and after being put through the wringer let 
two persons, standing opposite, pull them into shape; 
dry in the sun. White flannels may be washed in the 
same way without shrinking. Calicoes and other colored 
fabrics can, before washing, be advantageously soaked for 
a time in a pail of water to which a sf)oonful of ox gall 
has been added. It helps to keep the color. A teacup 
of lye to a pail of water will improve the color of black 
goods when necessary to wash them, and vinegar in the 
rinsing water of pink or green will brighten those colors, 
as will soda for purple and blue. 

FOR CLOTHES THAT FADE. 

One ounce sugar of lead in a pail of rain water. Soak 
over night. 

LAMP-WICKS. 

To insure a good light, wicks must be changed often, 
as they soon become clogged and do not permit the free 
passage of the oil. Soaking wicks in vinegar twenty-four 
hours before placing in lamp insures a clear flame. 

TO MAKE OLD CREPE LOOK NEARLY 
EQUAL TO NEW. 

Place a little water in a teakettle and let it boil until 
there is plenty of steam from the spout; then, holding 
the crepe in both hands, pass it to and fro several times 
through the steam, and it will be clean and nearly e(jual 
to new. 

A CEMENT FOR STOVES. 

If the stove is cracked, a good cement is made for 



262 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

it as follows: "Wood ashes and salt in equal proportions, 
reduced to a paste with cold water, and filled in the 
cracks when the stove is cool. It will soon harden. 

TO CLEAN KID GLOVES. 

Rub with very slightly damp bread crumbs. If not 
effectual, scrape upon them dry Fuller's earth or French 
chalk when on the hands, and rub them quickly together 
in all directions. Do this several times. Or put gloves 
of a light color on the hands and wash the hands in a basin 
of spirits of hartshorn. Some gloves may be washed in a 
strong lather made of soft soap and warm water or milk; 
or wash with rice pulp; or sponge them well with ter- 
pentine, and hang them in a warm place or where there 
is a current of air, and all smell of terpentine will be 
removed. 

STAINS AND SPOTS. 

Children's clothes, table linens, towels, etc., should 
be thoroughly examined before wetting, as soap-suds, 
washing fluids, etc., will fix almost any stain past re- 
moval. Many stains will pass away by being simply 
washed in pure soft water; or alcohol will remove, before 
the articles have been in soap-suds, many stains. Iron- 
mold, mildew, or almost any similar spot, can be taken 
out by dipping in diluted citric acid; then cover with 
salt and lay in the bright sun until the stain disappears. 
If of long standing, it may be necessary to repeat the 
wetting and the sunlight. Be careful to rinse in several 
waters as soon as the stain is no longer visible. Ink, 
fruit, wine and mildew stains must first be washed in 
clear, cold water, removing as much of the spots as can 
be ; then mix one teaspoonful of oxalic acid and half a 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 263 

pint of rain water. Dip tte stain in this and wipe off 
in clear water. Wash at once, if a fabric that will bear 
washing. A tablespoonfnl of white currant juice, if any 
can be had, is even better than lemon. This preparation 
may be used on the most delicate articles without injury. 
Shake it up before using it, and be careful and put out of 
the reach of meddlers or little folks, as it is poisonous. 

TO REMOVE GREASE SPOTS. 

An excellent mixture to remove grease spots from 
boys' and men's clothing particularly, is made of four 
parts alcohol to one part of ammonia and about half as 
much ether as ammonia. Apply the liquid to the grease 
spot, and then rub diligently with a sponge and clear 
water. The chemistry of the peration seems to be that 
the alcohol and ether dissolve the grease, and the ammo- 
nia forms a soap with it which is washed out with the 
water. The result is much more satisfactory than when 
somethiui;- is used which only seems to spread the spot 
and make it fainter, but does not actually remove it. If 
oil is spilt on the carpet, and you immediately scatter 
corn meal over it, the oil will be absorbed by it. Oil may 
also be removed from carpets on which yuu do not dare 
to put ether or ammonia, by laying thick blotting paper 
over it and jiressing a hot flat-iron on it. Repeat the 

oration several times, nsing a clean paper each time. 

• 

STAINS ON MARBLE. 

Iron-rust stains on marble can usually be removed 
by rubbing with lemon juice. Almost all other stains 
may be taken off by mixing one ounce of finely-pow- 
dered chalk, one o£ pumice stone and two ounces of com- 



. 84 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOS. 

mon soda. Sift these together througn a fine sieve and 
mix with water. "When thoroughly mixed, rub this mix- 
tura over the stains faithfully and the stains will disap- 
pear. Wash the marble after this with soap and water, 
dry and polish with a chamois skin, and the marble will 
look like new. 



A thin coating of three parts lard melted with one 
part resin, applied to stoves and grates, will prevent their 
rusting in summer. 

PAINT OR VARNISH. 

Oil of turpentine or benzine will remove spots of 
pnint, varnish or pitch from white or colored cotton or 
woolen goods. After using it they should be washed in 
soap-suds. 

TO REMOVE INK FROM CARPETS. 

When freshly spilled, ink can be removed from car- 
pets by wetting in milk. Take cotton batting and soak 
up all the ink it will receive, being careful not to let it 
spread. Then take fresh cotton, wet in miik, and sop it 
up carefully. Kepeat this operation, changing cotton 
and milk each time. After most of the ink has been 
taken up in this way, with fresh cotton and clean, rub 
the spot. Continue till all disappears; then wash the 
spot in clear warm water and a little soap; rinse in clear 
water and rub till nearly dry. If the ink is dried in, we 
know of no way that will not take the color from the 
carpet as well as the ink, unless the ink is on a white 
jjpot. In that c.se, salts of lemon, or soft-soap, gtarcii 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 266 

/ind lemon juice will remove the ink as easily as if on 
cotton. 

TO REMOVE INK FROM PAPER. 

Put one pound of cloride of lime to four qx;arts of 
water. Shake well together and let it stand twenty-four 
hours; then strain through a clean cotton cloth. Add 
one teaspoonful of acetic acid to one ounce ot this pre- 
pared lime water, and apply to the blot, and the ink will 
disappear. Absorb the moisture with blotting paper. 
The remainder may be bottled, closely corked, and set 
aside for future use. 



An occasional feed of hard boiled eggs made fine 
and mixed with cracker crumbs, is good for canary birds. 
Feed a couple of thimblefuls at a time. 

INK ON ROSEWOOD OR MAHOGANY. 

If ink has i:een unfortunately spilled on mahogany, 
rosewood, or black walnut furniture, put half a dozen 
drops of spirits of nitre into a spoonful of water, and 
touch the stain with a feather wet in this; as soon as the 
ink disa])pears, rub the place immediately with a cloth 
ready wet in cold water, or the nitre will leave a white 
spot very difficult to remove. If after washing off the 
nitre the ink spot till lingers, make the mixture a little 
stronger and use the second time, and never forget to 
wash it off at once. 

COAL FIRE. 

If your coal fire is low, throw on a tablespoon of 
8alt, and it will help it very much. 



266 THE EVEEYDAY" COOK BOOK. 

POLISH FOR BRIG-HT STOVES AND STEEL 

ARTICLES. 

One tablespoonful of turpentine; one tablespoonful 
of sweet oil; emery powder. Mix the turpentine and 
sweet oil together, stirring in sufficient emery powder to 
make the mixture of the thickness of cream. Put it on 
the article with a piece of soft flannel, rub off quickly 
with another piece, then polish with a little emery pow- 
der and clean leather. 

TO PREVENT PUMPS FROM FREEZING. 

Take out the lower valve in the fall, and drive a 
tack under it, projecting in such a way that it cannot 
quite close. The water will then leak back into the well 
or cistern, while the working qualities of the pump will 
not be damaged. 



To keep starch from sticking to irons rub the irons 
with a little piece of wax or sperm. 

TO KEEP OFF MOSQUITOES. 

Rub exposed parts with kerosene. The odor is not 
noticed after a few minutes, and children especially are 
much relieved by its use. 

TO BRIGHTEN GILT FRAMES. 

Take sufficient flour of sulphur to give a golden 
tinge to about one and one-half pints of water, and in 
this boil four or five bruised onions or garlic, which will 
answer the same purpose. Strain off the liquid, and with 
i t^ when cold, wash, with St gof t bruslij any gilding which 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 267 

requires restoring, and when dry it will come out as 
bright as new work. 

TO MAKE HENS LAY IN WINTER. 

Keep them warm ; keep corn constantly by them, 
but do not feed it to them. Feed them with meat scraps 
when lard or tallow has been tried, or fresh meat. Some 
chop green peppers finely, or mix Cayenne pepper with 
corn meal to feed them. Let them have a frequent taste 
of green food, a little gravel and lime, or clam-shells. 

TO PRESERVE STEEL PENS. 

Steel pens are destroj'ed by corrosion from acid in 
the ink. Put in the ink some nails or old steel pens, and 
the acid will exhaust itself on them, and the pens in Ubu 
will not corrode. 

MICE.- 

Pumpkin seeds are very attractive to mice, and traps 
baited with them will soon destroy this little pest. 

CAMPHOR 

Placed in trunks or drawers will prevent mice from do. 
ing them injury. 

TO CLEAN COMBS, 

If it can be avoided never wash combe, as the water 
often makes the teeth split, and the tortoiseshell or horn 
of which they are made, rough. Small brushes, manu- 
factured purposely for cleaning combs, may be purchased 
at a trifling cost; with this the comb chould be well 



368 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

brushed, and afterward wiped with a cloth or towel. 

FOR CLEANING INK SPOTS. 

Ink spots on the fingers may be instantly removed 
by a little ammonia. Einse the hands after washing in 
clear water. A little ammonia in a few spoonfuls of al- 
cohol is excellent to sponge silk dresses that have grown 
"shiny" or rusty, as well as to take out spots. A silk, 
particularly a black, becomes almost like new when so 
sponged. 

FOR CLEANING JEWELRY. 

For cleaning jewelry there is nothing better than 
ammonia and water. If very dull or dirty, rub a little 
soap on a soft brush and brush them in this wash, i-inse 
in cold water, dry first in an old handkerchief, and theu 
rub with buck or chamois skin. Their freshness and 
brilliancy when thus cleaned, cannot be surpassed by any 
compound \ised by jewelers. 

FOR WASHING SILVER and SILVERWARE. 

For washing silver, put half a teaspoonful ammonia 
into the suds; have the water hot; wash quickly, using 
a small brush; rinse in hot water aud dry with a clean 
linen towel; then rub very dry with a chamois skin. 
Washed in this manner, silver becomes very brilliant, 
requires no polishing with any of the powders or whiting 
usually employed, and does not wear out. Silver-plate, 
jewelry and door plates can be beautifully cleaned and 
made to look like new by dropping a soft cloth or cham- 
ois skin into a weak preparation of ammonia-water and 
rubbing the articles with it. Put half a teaspoonful into 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 269 

clear water to wash tumblers or glass ot any kind, rinse 
and dry well, and they will be beautifully clear. 

FOR WASHING GLASS and GLASSWARE. 

For washing windows, looking-glasses, etc., a little 
ammonia in the water saves much labor, aside from giv- 
ing a better polish than anything else; and for general 
house-cleaning it removes dirt, smoke and grease most 
etiectually. 

INSECTS and VERMIN. 

Dissolve two pounds of alum in three or four cjuarts 
of water. Let it remain over night till all the alum is 
dissolved. Then, with a brush, apply, boiling hot, to 
every joint or crevice in the closet or shelves whei-e Cro- 
ton bugs, ants, cockroaches, etc., intrnde; also to the 
joints and crevices of bedsteads, as bedbugs dislike it as 
much as Croton bags, roaches or ants. Brush all the 
cracks in the floor and mop-boards, keeping it boiling 
hot while using. 

To keep woolens and fm-s from moths, two .things 
;iie to be observed — first, to see that none are in the arti- 
cles when they are put away, and, second, to put them 
where the parent moth cannot enter. Tin cases, soldered 
tiffht, whiskv barrels, headed so that not e\'en a liquid 
can get in or out, have been used to keep out moths. A 
piece of stron.^ brown paper with not a hole through 
which even a large pin can enter, is just as good. Put 
the articles in a close box and co\er every joint with 
paper, or resort to whatever will be a complete covering. 
A wrapper of common cotton cloth, m put around aijd 
Becured, is often used. Wherever a knitting needle will 



270 THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 

pass, the parent moth can enter. Carefully exclude the 
insect, and the articles will be safe. 

MOTHS IN CARPETS. 

Persons troubled with carpet moths may get rid of 
them by scrubbing the floor with strong hot salt and 
water before laying the carpet, and sprinkling the carpet 
with salt once a week before sweeping. 

SMOOTH SAD-IRONS. 

To have your sad-irons clean and smooth rub them 
first with a piece of wax tied in a cloth, and afterwards 
scour them on a paper or thick cloth strewn with coarse 
salt. 

TO SWEETEN MEAT. 

A little charcoal thrown into the pot will sweeten 
meat that is a little old. Not if it is anyway tainted — 
it is then not fit to eat — but only if kept a little longer 
than makes it quite fresh. 

STOVE POLISH. 

Stove lustre, when mixed with turpentine and 
applied in the usual manner, is blacker, more glossy and 
more durable than when mixed with any other liquid. 
The turpentine pi-events ruft, and when put on an old 
rusty stove will make it look as well as new. 

CLEANING WHITE PAINT. 

Spirits of ammonia, used in sufficient quantity to 
soften the water, and ordinary hard soap, will make the 
paiut look white and clean with half the effort of any 



THE EVEEYDAY COOK BOOK. 271 

other method I ever have tried. Oare should be taken 
not to have too much ammonia, or the paint will bf 
injured. 

TO CLEANSE THE INSIDE OF JARS. 

This can be done in a few minutes hy filling the jars 
with hot water (it need not be scalding hot), and then 
stirring in a teaspoonful or more of baking soda. Shake 
well, then empty the jar at once, and if any of the former 
odor remains about it, fill again with water and soda; 
shake well, and rinse out in cold water. 

FURNITURE POLISH. 

Equal proportions of linseed oil, turpentine, vinegar^ 
and spirits of wine. 

Mode: When used, shake the mixture well, and 
rub on the furniture with a piece of linen rag, and polish 
with a clean duster. Vinegar and oil, rubbed in with 
flannel, and the furniture rubbed with a clean duster, 
produce a very good polish. 



Squeaking doors ought to have the hinges oiled by 
a feather dipped in some linseed oil. 

A soft cloth, wet*-ed in alcohol, is excellent to wipe 
off French plate-glass and mirrors. 

A red-hot iron will soften old putty so that it can be 
easily removed. 

TO REMOVE STAINS FROM MATTRESSES. 

Make a thick paste by wetting starch with cold 
water. Spread this on the stain, first putting the mat- 



272 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

tress in the sun ; rub this oflf after an hour or go, and if 
the ticking is not clean try the process again. 

KALSOMINING. 
For plain white use one pound white glue, twenty 
pounds English whiting; dissolve glue by boiling in 
about three pints of water; dissolve whiting with hot 
water; make the consistency of thick batter; then add 
glue and one cup soft soap. Dissolve a piece of alum 
the size of a hen's egg, add and mix the whole thoroughly. 
Let it cool before using. If too thick to spread nicely 
add more water till it spreads easily. For blue tints add 
five cents' worth of Prussian blue, and a little Venetian 
red for lavender. For peach-blow use red in white alone. 
The above quantity is enough to cover four ceilings, six- 
teen feet square, with two coats, and will not rub off as 
the whitewash does made of lime. 

PAPERING WHITEWASHED WALLS. 
There are many ways, but we mention those that are 
the most reliable. Take a perfectly clean broom, and wet 
the walls all over with clean water; then with a small 
sharp hoe or scraper scrape off all the old whitewash you 
can. Then cut your paper of the right length, and, when 
you are all ready to put on the paper, wet the wall with 
strong vinegar. Another way is to make very thin paste 
by dissolving one pound of white glue in five quarts of 
warm water, and wash the walls with it before putting 
on the paper. A very good way is to apply the paste to 
both paper and wall. The paste may be made from 
either wheat or rye fiour, but must be put on warm. 

HOW TO CLEAN CORSETS. 
Take out the steels sA front and sides, then scrub 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 273 

thoroughly with tepid or cold lather of white castile soap, 
using a very small scrubbing brush. Do not lay them 
in water. When quite clean let cold water run oh them 
freely from the spigot to rinse out the soap thoroughly. 
Dry without ironing (after pulling lengthwise until they 
are straight and shapely) in a cool place. 

TO CLEAN HAIRBRUSHES. 

Do not use soap, but put a tablespoon of hartshorn 
into the water, having it only tepid, and dip up and down 
until clean; then dry with the brushes down, and they 
will be like new ones. If you do not have ammonia, use 
soda; a teaspoonful dissolved in the water will do very 
well. 

HOW TO WASH FLANNELS. 

There are many conflicting theories in regard to the 
proper way to wash flannels, but I am convinced, from 
careful observation, that the true way is to wash them in 
water in which you can comfortably bear your hand. Make 
Buds before putting the flannels in, and do not rub soap 
on the flannel. I make it a rule to have only one piece 
of flannel put in the tub at a time. Wash in two suds if 
much soiled; then rinse thoroughly in clean, weak suds, 
wring, and hang up ; but do not take flannels out of warm 
water and hang out in a freezing air, as that certainly 
tends to shrink them. It is better to dry them in the 
house, unless the sun shines. In washing worsted goods, 
such as men's pantaloons, pursue the same course, only 
do not wring them, but hang them up and let them 
drain; while a little damp bring in and press smoothly 
with as hot an iron as you can use without scorching 



274 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

the goods. Th(3 reason for not wringing them is to pre- 
vent wrinkles. 

CLEANING- LACE. 

Cream-colored Spanish lace can be cleaned and made 
to look like new by rubbing it in dry flour; rub as if you 
were washing in water. Then take it outdoors and shake 
all the flour out; If not perfectly clean, repeat the rub- 
bing in a little more clean flour. The flour must be very 
thoroughly shaken from the lace, ®r the result will be far 
from satisfactory. White knitted hoods can be cleaned 
in this way ; babies' socks, also, if only slightly soiled. 

NEW KETTLES. 

The best way to prepare a new iron kettle for use is 
to fill it with clean potato peelings, boil them for an hour 
or more, then wash the kettle with hot water; wipe it dry 
and rub it with a little lard; repeat the rubbing for half 
a dozen times after using. In this way you will prevent 
rust and all the annoyances liable to occur in the use of 
a new kettle. 

TO KEEP FLIES OFF GILT FRAMES. 

Boil three or four onions in a pint of water and 
apply with a soft brush. 

TO PREVENT KNIVES FROM RUSTING. 

In laying aside knives or other steel implements, 
they should be slightly oiled and wrapped in tissue paper 
to prevent their rusting. A salty atmosphere will in a 
short time quite ruin all steel articles unless some such 
precaution is taken. 



TH£ EVEETDAY COOK BOOK. 275 

CEMENT FOR O-LASBWARE. 

For mending valuable glass objeots, \7hich would be 
disfigured by common cement, chrome cement may be 
used. Xhia is a mixture of five parts of gelatine to one 
ot a solution of acid chromate of lime. The broken 
edges are covered with this, pressed together and ex- 
posed to sunlight, the effect of the latter being to render 
the compound insoluble even in boiling water. 

WATERPROOF PAPER. 

Excellent paper for paeking may be made of old 
newspapers; the tougher the paper of course the better. 
A mixture is made of copal varnish, boiled linseed oil 
and turpentine in equal parts. It is painted on the paper 
with a fiat varnish brush an inch and a half wide, and 
the sheets are laid out to dry for a few minutes. This 
paper has been very successfully used for packing plants 
for sending long distances, and is probably equal to the 
paper commonly used by nurserymen. 

RECIPE FOR VIOLET INK. 

To make one gallon, take one ounce of violet ana- 
line, dissolve it in one gill of hot alcohol. Stir it a few 
moments. When thoroughly dissolved add one gallon 
of boiling water, and the ink is made. As the analine 
colors^ vary a great deal in quality, the amount of dilu- 
tion must vary with the sample used and the flhade de- 
termined by trial. 

PERSPIRATION. 

The unpleasant odor produced by perspiration is fre- 
quently the source of vexation to persons who are sub- 



2f78 THE EVEBTDAT COOK BOOK. 

ject to it. Nothing is simpler than to remove this odor 
much more effectually than by the application of such 
costly unguents and perfumes as are in use. It is only 
necessary to procure some of the compound spirits of 
ammonia, and place about two tablespoonfuls in a basin 
of water. Washing the face, hands and arms with this 
leaves the skin as clean, sweet and fresh as one could 
wish. The wash is perfectly harmless and very cheap. 
It is recommended on the authority of an experienced 
physician. 

RENEWING- OLD KID GLOVES. 

Make a thick mucilage by boiling a handful of flax-, 
seed; add a little dissolved toilet soap; then, when the 
mixture cools, put the glove on the hands and rub them 
with a piece of white flannel wet with the tnixture. Do 
not wet the gloves through. 

COLOGNE WATER. 

Take a pint of alcohol and put in thirty drops of oil 
of lemon, thirty of bergamot, and half a gill of water. 
If mutk or lavender is desired, add the same quantity of' 
each. The oils should be put in the alcohol and shaken 
well before the water is added. Bottle it for use. 

TO CLEANSE A SPONGE. 

By rubbing a fresh lemon thoroughly into a soured 
sponge and rinsing it several times in lukewarm water, 
it will become as sweet as when new. 

ICY WINDOWS. 

"Windows may be kept free from ice and polished by 



THE ETEETDAY COOK BOOK. 277 

rubbing the glass with a sponge dipped in alcohol. 

To remove blood stains from cloth, saturate with 
kerosene, and after standing a little, wash in warm water. 

CAMPHOR ICE. 

One ounce of lard, one ounce of spermaceti, one 
ounce of camphor, one ounce of almond oil, one-half 
cake of white wax; melt and turn into molds. 

STARCH POLISH. 

Take one ounce of spermaceti and one ounce of 
white wax, melt and run it into a thin cake on a plate. 
A piece the size of a quarter dollar added to a quart of 
prepared starch, gives a beautiful luster to the clothes and 
prevents the iron from sticking. 

TO CLEAN FEATHERS. 

Cover the feathers with a paste made of pipe-clay 
and water, rubbing them one way onlj. When quite 
dry, shake off all the powder and curl with a knife. 
Grebe feathers may be washed with white soap in soft 
water. 

TO TEST NUTMEGS. 

To test nutmegs, prick them with a pin, and if they 
are good the oil will instantly spread around the punc- 
ture. 

TO CLEAN MICA. 

Mica, in stoves, when smoked, is readily cleaned by 
taking it out and thoroughly washing with vinegar a lit- 
tle diluted. If the black does not come off at once, let 
it soak a little. 



278 THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK 

TO SOFTEN HARD WATER. 

Add half a pound of the best quick lime dissolved 
in water to every hundred gallons. Snjaller proportions 
may be more conveniently managed, and if allowed to 
stand a short time, the lime will have united with the 
carbonate of lime and been deposited at the bottom of 
the receptacle. Another way is to put a gallon of lye 
into a barrelful of water. 

TO DESTROY VERMIN IN THE HAIR. 

Powdered cevadilla one ounce, powdered staves-acre 
one ounce, powdered panby seed one ounce, powdered 
tobacco one ounce. Mix well and rub among the roots 
of the hair thoroughly. 

TO REMOVE BRUISES FROM FURNITURE. 

Wet the bruised spot with warm water. Soak a 
piece of brown paper of several thicknesses in warm 
water, and lay over the place. Then apply a warm flat- 
iron until the moisture is gone. Repeat the process if 
needful, and the bruise will disappear. 

PEARL SMELLING SALT. 

Powdered carbonate of ammonia, one ounce; strong 

solution of ammonia, half a fluid ounce; oil of rosemary, 

ten drops; oil of bergamot, tea drops. Mix, and whilo 

moist put in a wide mouthed bottle which is to be well 

closed. 

POUNDED O-LASS, 

Pounded glass, mixed with dry corn-meal, and placed 
within the reach of rats, it is said, will banish them from 



THE EVEBYDAY COOK BOOK. 279 

the premises; or sprinkle Cayenne pepper in their holes. 

POLISH FOR BOOTS. 

Take of ivory-black and treacle each four ounces; 
sulphuric acid, one ounce; best olive oil, two spoonfuls, 
best white^wine vinegar, three half pints; mix the ivory- 
black and treacle well in an earthern jar; then add the 
sulphuric acid, continuing to stir the mixture; next pour 
in the oil, and, lastly, add the vinegar, stirring it in by 
degrees until thoroughly incorporated. 

TO CLEAN PLATE. 

Wash the plate well to remove all grease, in a strong 
lather of common yellow soap and boiling water, and 
wipe it quite dry; then mix as much hartshorn powder 
us will be required, into thick paste, with cold water or 
spirits of wine; smear this lightly over the plate with a 
piece of soft rag, and leave it for some little time to dry. 
When perfectly dry, brush it off quite clean with a soft 
plate-brush, and polish the plate with a dry leather. If 
the plate be very dirty, or much tarnished, spirits of wine 
will be found to answer better than water for mixing the 
paste. 

TO CLEAN DECANTERS. 

Roll up in small pieces some soft brown or blotting 
paper; wet them, and soap them well. Put them into 
the decanters about one-quarter full of warm water; 
shake them well for a few moments, then rinse with clear 
cold water; wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth, put 
the decanters to drain, and when dry t^ej will be almost 
as bright as new ones. 



280 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

SPOTS on TOWELS and HOSIERY. 

Spots on towels and hosiery will disappear with lit- 
tle trouble if a little ammonia is put into enough water 
to soak the articles,' and they are left in it an hour or two 
before washing; and it a cupful is put into the water in 
which white clothes are soaked the night before washing, 
the ease with which the articles can be washed, and their 
great whiteness and clearness when dried will be very 
gratifying. Remembering the small sum paid for three 
quarts of ammonia of common strength, one can easily 
see that no bleaching preparation can be more cheaply 
obtained. 

No articles in kitchen use are so likely to be neg- 
lected and abused as the dish-cloths and dish towels; and 
in washing these, ammonia, if properly used, is a greater 
comfort than anywhere else. Put a teaspoonful into the 
water in which these cloths are, or should be washed 
every day; rub soap on the towels. Put them in the 
water; let them stand a half hour or so, then rub theni 
out thoroughly, rinse faithfully, and dry out-doors in 
clear air and sun, and dish-cloths and towels need never 
look gray and dingy — a perpetual discotafort to all 

housekeepers. 

CROUP. 

Croup, it is said, can be cured in one minute, and 
the remedy is simply alum and sugar. The way to 
accomplish the deed is to take a knife or grater, and 
shave off in small particles about a teaspoonful of alum ; 
then mix it with twice its amount of sugar, to make it 
palatable, and administer it as quickly as possible. 
Almost instantaneous relief will foUow. 



In the summer season it is not an uncommon thing 



THE EYERTDAT COOK BOOK. 28t 

for persons going into the woods to be poisoned by con- 
tact with dogwood, ivy, or the poisoned oak. The severe 
itching and smarting which is thus produced may be 
relieved by first washing the parts with a solution of sal- 
eratns, two teaspoonf nls to the pint of water, and then 
applying cloths wet with extract of hamaramellis. Take 
a dose of Epsom salts internally or a double Eochellsr 
powder. 

CONVULSION FITS. 

Convulsion fits sometimes follow tlie feverish rrst- 
lessnesB produced by these causes ; in which cato a hot 
bath should be administered without delay, and the lower 
parts of the body rubbed, the bath being as hot i^s it can 
be without scalding the tender skin. 

BURNS AND GCAI.DS. 

A burn or scald is always painful ; but the pain can 
be instantly relieved by the ubc of 1 i-carbonatc of soda, 
*r common baking soda (saleratu&). Put two table- 
epoonfuls of soda in a half cup of water. "Wet a piece 
of linen cloth in the solution and ]..y it on (he burn. 
The pain will disappear as if by magic. If the burn is 
80 deep that the skin has peeled off, dredge the Cry soda 
directly on the part afiected. 

CUTS. 
For a slight cut there is nothing better to control 
the hemorrhage than common unglazed brown wrapping 
paper, such as is used by mafketmen and grocers; a 
piece to be bound over the wound. 

OLD ON THE CHEST. 
A flannel dipped in boiling water, and sprinkled 



282 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

with turpentine, laid on the chest as quickly as po8si1b«^, 
will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness. 

BLEEDING- FBOM THE NOSE. 

Many children, especially those of a sanguineous 
temperament, are subject to sudden discharges of blood 
from some part of the body; and as all such fluxes are 
in general the result of an effort of nature to relieve the 
system from some overload or pressure, such dischargss, 
unless in excess, and when likely to produce debility, 
should not be rashly or too abruptly checked. In gen- 
eral, these discharges are confined to the summer or 
spring months of the year, and follow pains in the head, 
a sense of drowsiness, languor or oppression, and as such 
symptoms are relieved by the loss of blood, the hemor- 
rhage should, to a certain extent, be encouraged. When? 
however, the bleeding is excessive, or returns too fre- 
quently, it becomes necessary to apply means to subdue 
or mitigate the amount. For this purpose the sudden 
and unexpected application ef .cold is itself sufficient in 
most cases to arrest the most active hemorrhage. A wet 
towel laid suddenly on the back, between the shoulders, 
and placing the child in a recumbent posture is often 
sufficient to effect the object; where, however, the effu- 
sion resists such simple means, napkins wrung out of 
cold water must be laid across the forhead and noBe,,the 
hands dipped in cold water, and a bottle of hot water 
applied to the feet. If, in spite of these means, the 
bleeding continues, a little fine wool or a few folds of 
lint, tied toge^>her bj a piece of thread, mast be pushed 
np the nofltr'l from whiok th* llUrad flswi; to act as a 
and presst'iTe on the bleedhi({ resceL TThen th* 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 283 

discharge has entirely ceased, the plug is to be pulled 
out by means of the thread. To prevent a repetition of 
the hemorrhage, the body should be sponged every morn- 
ing with cold water, and the child put under a course ot 
steel wine, have open-air exercise, and, if possible, salt 
water bathing. For children, a key suddenly dropped 
down the back betwen the skin and clothes, will often 
immediately arrest a copious bleeding. 

CHILBLAINS. 

Chilblains are most irritating to children. The fol- 
lowing is an infallible cure for unbroken chilblains: Hy- 
drochloric acid, diluted, one-quarter ounce; hydrocyanic 
acid, diluted, thirty drops ; camphor water, six ounces. 
This chilblain lotion cures mild cases by one application. 
It is a deadly poison, and should be kept under lock and 
key. A responsible person should apply it to the feet of 
children. This must not be applied to broken chilblains. 

TO CURE A STING OF BEE OR "WASP. 

Mix common earth with water to about the consist- 
ency of mud. Apply at once. 

FOR TOOTHACHE. 

Alum reduced to an iaipalpable powder, two drachms ; 
nitrous spirit of ether, seven drachms. Mix and apply 
to the tooth. 

CHOKING. 

-^ A piece of food lodged in the throat may sometimes 
be pushed down with the finger, or removed with a hair- 
pin qnickly straightened and booked at the end, or b^ 



284 THE EVEBTDAY COOK BOOK. 

two or three vigorous blows on the back between the 
shoulders. 



A very excellent carminative powder for flatulant 
infanta may be kept in the house, and employed with 
advantage, whenever the child is in pain or griped, by 
dropping five grains of oil of aniseed and two of pepper- 
mint on half an onnce of lump sugar, and rubbing it in a 
mortar, with a drachm of magnesia, into a fine powder. 
A small quantity of this may be given in a little water 
«t any time, and always with benefit. 

CUBEB BERRIES FOR CATARRH. 

A new remedy for catarrh is crushed cubeb berries 
smoked in a pipe, emitting the smoke through, the nose; 
after a few trials this will be easy to do. If the no_se is 
stopped up so that it is almost impossible to breathe', one 
pipeful will make the head as clear as a bell. For sore 
throat, asthma and bronchitis, swallowing the smoke ef- 
fects immediate relief. It is the best remedy in the 
world for offensive breatli, and will make the most foul 
breath pure and sweet. Sufferers from that horrid dis- 
ease, ulcerated catarrh^ will find this remedy unequalled, 
and a month's use will cure the most obstinate case. A 
single trial will convince anyone. Eating the uncrushed 
berries is also good for sore throat and all bronchial com- 
plaints. After smoking do not expose yourself to cold 
air for at least fifteen minutes. 

DIARRHCEA, 

For any form of diarrhoea that,, by excessive action, 
den|^g.nds a speedy correction, the most e^cacion| ^'ejuedy 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 286 

that can be employed in all ages and conditions of child- 
hood, is the tincture of Mno, of which from ten to thirty 
drops, mixed with a little sugar and water in a spoon, 
are to be given every two or three hours till the undue 
&^tion has been checked. Often the change of diet to 
ric^j, milk, eggs, or the substitution of animal for vegeta- 
ble food, vice versa, will correct an unpleasant and almost 
ehronio state of diarrhoea. 



II it is not convenient to fill flannel bags for the sick 
room with sand, bran will answer the purpose very well, 
and will retain the heat a long time. 

BITES OF DOQ-S. 

The lonly safe remedy in case of a bite from a dog 
suspected of madness, is to burn out the wound thor- 
oughly with red-hot iron, or with lunar caustic, for fully 
eight seconds, so as to destroy the entire surface of the 
wound. Do this as soon as possible, for no time is to be 
lost. Of course it will be expected that the parts touched 
with the caustic will turn black. ' 

MEASLES AND SCARLATINA. 

Measleu and scarlatina much resemble each other in 
their early stages; headache, restlessness and fretfulness 
are the symptoms of both. Shivering fits, succeeded by 
a hot skin ; pains in the back and limbs accompanied by 
sickness and (in severe cases) soar throat; pain about the 
jaws, difficulty in swallowing, running at the eyes, whiqh 
become red and inflamed, while the face is hot and flushed, 
often distinguish scarlatina from scarlet fever, of which 
H Ib only a mild form. While the case is doubtfnl, % 



286 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK 

dessertspoonful of spirits of nitre, diluted in water, given 
at bedtime, will throw the child into a gentle perspira- 
tion, and will bring ou* the rash in either case. In mea- 
sles, this appears first on the face; in scarlatina, -on the 
chest; and in both cases a doctor shouM be called in. In 
scarlatina, tartar-emetic powder or ipecacuhana may be 
administered in the meantime. 

STYE IN THE EYE. 

Styes are little abscesses which form between the 
roots of the eyelashes, and are rarely larger than a small 
pea. The best way to manage them is to bath them fre- 
quently with warm water, or in warm poppy water if 
very painful. When they have burst, use an ointmeat 
composed of one part of ci'tron ointment and four pjirts 
of spermaceti, well rubbed together, and smear along the 
edge of the eyelid. Give a grain or two of calomel with 
five or eight grains of rhubarb, according to the age of 
the child, twice a week. The old-fashioned and ap^r- 
ently absurd practice of rubbing the stye? with a ring, is 
as good and speedy a cure as that by any process of med- 
icinal application ;, though the number of times it is rub- 
bed, or the quality of the ring and direction of the 
strokes, has nothing to do with its success. That press- 
ure and the friction excite the vessels of the part and 
cause an absorption of the effused matter under the eye- 
lash. The edge of the nail, will answer as well as » ring. 

FOR CONSTIPATION. 

One or two figs eaten fastly is sufficient for sowe, 
and they are especially good in the case of children, as 
there is no trouble in getting them to take tkem. A spoo* 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 287 

of wbeaten bran in a glass of water is a simple remedy 
and quite effective. 

LEANNiSSS 

Is caused generally by lack of power in the digestive 
organs to digest and assimilate the fat-producing ele- 
ments of food. First restore digestion, take plenty of 
sleep, drink all the water the stomach will bear in the 
morning on rising, take moderate exercise in the open 
air, eat .oatmeal, cracked wheat, Graham mush, baked 
sweet apples, roasted and broiled beef, cultivate jolly 
people and bathe daily. 

SUPERFLUOUS HAIRS 

Are best left alone. Shaving only increases the strength 
of the hair, and all depilatories are dangerous and some- 
times disfigure the face. The only sure plan is to spread 
on a piece of leather equal parts of garbanum and pitch 
plaster, lay it on the hair as smoothly as possible, let it 
remain three or four minutes, then remove it with the 
hairs, root and branch. This is severe, but effective. 
Kerosene will also remove them. If sore after using, rub 

on sweet oil. 

THE BREATH. 

Nothing makes one so disagreeable to others as a 
bad breath. It is caused by bad teeth, diseased stomach, 
or disease of the nostrils. Neatness and care of the 
health will prevent and cure it. 

THE QUININE CURE FOR DRUNKENNESS. 

Pulverize one pound of fresh quill-red Peruvian 
bark, and aoak it in one pint ot diluted aleohol. Strain 



288 THE EVEEYDAr COOK BOOK. 

and evaporate down to one-half pint. For the first and 
second days give a teaspoonful every three hours. If too 
much is taken, headache will result, and in that , case 
the doses should be diminished. On the third day give 
one-half a teaspoonful; on the fourth reduce the dose to 
fifteen drops, then to ten, and then to five. Seven days, 
it is said, will cure average cases, though some require a 
whole month. 

FOR SORE THROAT. 

Cnt slices of salt pork or fat bacon; simmer a few 
moments in hot vinegar, and apply to throat as hot as 
possible. When this is taken off, as the throat is relieved, 
put around a bandage of soft flannel. A gargle of equal 
parts of borax and alum, dissolved in water, is also 
excellent. To be used frequently. 

A GOOD CURE FOR COLDS. 

Boil two ounces of flaxseed in one quart of water; 
strain and add two ounces of rock candy, one-h^lf pint of 
honey, juice of three lemons; mix, and let all boil well; 
let cool, and bottle. Dose: One cupful on going to 
bed, one-half cupful before meals. The hotter you drink 
it the better. 

TO STOP BLEEDINa. 

A handful of flour bound on the cnt. 

A HEALTHFUL APPETIZER. 

How often we hear women who do their own cook, 
ing say that by the time they have prepared a meal, and 
it is ready for the table, they are too tired to eat Ooe 



THE EVERY DA.Y COOK BOOK 289 

way to mitigate this is to take, about half an hour 
before dinner, a raw egg, beat it uptil light, put in a 
little sugar and milk, flavor it, and "drink it down;" 
it will remove the faint, tired-out feeling, and will 
not spoil your appetite for dinner. 

TO REMOVE DISCOLORATION FROM 
BRUISES. 

Apply a cloth wrong out in very hot water, and 
renew frequently until the pain ceases. Or apply 
raw beefsteak. 

EARACHE. 

There are scarcely any ache to wnich children are 
subject so hard to bear and difficult to cure as the 
earache; but there is a remedy never known to fail. 
Take a bit of cotton batting, put upon it a pinch of 
black pepper, gather it up and tie it, dip in sweet oil 
and insert into the ear; put a flannel bandage over 
the head to keep it warm. It will give immediate re- 
lief. As soon as any soreness is felt in the ear, let 
three or four drops of the tincture of arnica be pour- 
ed in and the orifice be filled wth a little cottonwool 
to exclude the air. If the arnica be not resorted to 
until there is actual pain, then the cure may not be as 
speedy, but it is just as certain, although it may be 
necessary to repeat the operation. It is a sure pre- 
ventive against gathering in the ear, which is the 
usual cause of earache. 

TO CURE TOOTHACHE. 

The worst toothache, or neuralgia coming from 
the teeth, may be speedily and delightfully ended by 
the application of a bit of clean cotton, saturated in 



290 THE EVERYDAY COOKBOOK. 

a solution of ammonia, to the defective tooth. 
Sometimes the late sufferer is prompted to momen- 
tary laughter by the application, but the pain will 
disappear. 

FOR FELON. 

Take common rock salt, as used for salting down 
pork or beef, dry in an oven, and pound it fine and 
mix with spirits of turpentine in equal parts; put it in 
a rag and wrap it around the parts effected; as it 
gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four hours you 
are cured. The felon will be dead. 



Coffee pounded in a mortar and roasted on an iron 
plate; sugar burned on hot coals, and vinegar boiled 
with myrrh and sprinkled on the floor and furniture 
of a sick room, are excellent deodorizers. 

Ti"" skin of a' boiled egg is the most efficacious 
remedy that can be applied to a boil. Peel it care- 
fully, wet and apply to the part affected. It will 
draw off the matter, and relieve the soreness in a 
few hours. 

TO CURE A WHITLOW. 

As soon as the whitlow has risen distinctly, a 
pretty large piece should be nipped out so that the 
watery matter may readily escape, and continue to 
flow out as fast as produced. A bread and water 
poultice should be put on for a few days, when the 
the wound should be bound up lightly with some 
mild oinment, when a cure will be speedily completed. 
Constant poulticing both before and after the open- 
ing of the whitlow is the only practice needed; but 
as the matter lies deep, when it is necessary to open 



THE Everyday cook book. 2fli 

the abscess the incision must be made deep to reach 
the suppuration. 

TAPE-WORMS. 

Tape-worms are said to be removed by refraining 
from supper and breakfast, and at eight o'clock 
taking one-third part of two hundred mincid pumkin 
seeds, the shells of which have been removed by hot. 
water; at nine take onother third, at ten the remain- 
der,and follow it at eleven with strong dose of costor 
oil. 

FOR A CAKED BREAST 

Bake large potatoes, put two or more in a woolen 
stocking; crush them soft and apply to the breast as 
hot as can be borne; repeat constanly till relieved. 

A good remedy for blistered feet from long walking 
is to rub the feet at going to bed with spirits mixed 
into the palm of the hand. 

A lady writes that sufferers from asthma should 
get a muskrat skin and wear it over their lungs, with 
the far side next to the body. It will bring certain 
relief. 

CHAPPED HANDS. 

Powdered starch is an excellent preventive of chap- 
ping of the hands, when it is rubbed over them after 
washing and drying them thoroughly. It will also 
prevent the needle in sewing from sticking and be- 
coming rusty. It is therefore advisable to have a 
small box of it in the work-box or basket, and near 
your wash-basin. 



THE EVERYDAIT COOie BOOK. 

LUNAR CAUSTIC. 

Lunar caustic, carefully applied so as not to touch 
the skin will destroy warts. 

CURE FOR RHEUMATISM AND BILIOUS 
HEADACHE. 

Finest Turkey rhubard, half an ounce; carbonate 

magne^a, one ounce; mixintimately; keep well corked 

■in glass bottle. Dose: One teaspoonfull, in milk 

and sugar, the first thing in the morning; reoeat till 

cured. Tried with success. 

FEVER AND AGUE. 

Four ounces galangal-root in a quart of gin, steeped 
in a warm place; take often. 



For a simple fainting fit a horizontal position and 
fresh air will usually suffice. If a person receive a 
severe shock caused by a fall or blow, handle care- 
fully without jarring. A horizontal position is best. 
Loosen all tight clothing from the throat, chest, and 
waist. If the patient can swallow^, give half tea- 
spoonfuU aromatic spirits of ammonia in a little 
water. If that cannot be procured, give whisky or 
brandy and water. Apply warmth to the feet and 
bowels. 

TO RESTORE FROM STROKE OF LIGHT- 
NING. 

Shower with cold water for two hours; if the pat- 
ient does not show signs of life, put salt in the water, 
and continue to shower an hour longer.

Relief For Inflamed Feet. 

The first thing to be done is to take off and throw 
away tight-fitting boots, wich hurt the tender feet 
as much as if they were put into a press. Then take 
one pint of wheat bran and one ounce of saleratus, 
and put it into a foot-bath, and add one ^rallon of 
hot water. When it has become cool enough put in 
the fef t, soak them for fifteen minutes, and the relief 
will -be almost immediate. Repeat this every night 
for a week, and the cure will be complete. The burn- 
ing, prickly sensation is caused by the pores of the 
skin being closed up so tightly by the pressure of the 
boots that they cannot perspire freely. 

WARM WATER. 

Warm w^ater is preferable to cold water as a drink to 
persons -who are subject to dyspeptic and bilious 
complaints, and it may be taken more freely than 
cold water, and consequently answers better as a 
diluent for carrying off bile, and removing obstruc- 
tions in the urinary secretion, in cases of stone and 
gravel. V'hen water of a temperature equal to that 
of the hnman body is used for drink, it proves con- 
siderablly stimulant, and is particularly suited to 
dyspeptic, bilious, gouty, and chlorotic subjects. 

CLEANING HOUSE. 

, SITTING AND DINNING ROOMS. 

By the time the upper part of the house is well 
cleaned and in 'good order, if it has been taken one 
room at a time, and leisurely, the dinning-room can 
be torn up on a warm and pleasant day, and, unless 
the alteratoins are to be extensive, scoured and got- 
ten to rights again before nightfall. And the sitting' 



294 THE EVERYDAY COOKfiOOK. 

room on another day. House cleaning, unless con< 
ducted on some plan which occasions little if any 
disturbance in the general domestic arrangement, is 
a fiuisance, particularly to the males of the house- 
hold. Nothing can be (next to a miserable dinner) 
more exasperating to a tired man, than to come 
'home and find the house topsy-turvy. And it cer- 
tainly raises his opinion of his wife's executive ability 
to find everything freshened and brightened, and 
that without his having been annoyed by the odor 
of Soapsuds, or yet having been obliged to betake 
himself to the kitchen for his meals. 

Butif the order of work is well laid out the night 
beforehand, the breakfast is leisurely eaten as usual, 
and the family dispersed in their various ways before 
commencing operations, then by working with a will 
wonders can be accomplished in. a very short time. 
It is not worth while to undertake a thorough clean- 
ing of all extra china, silver and glassware, which 
may be stored in the china closet in addition to the 
room itself. They can readily wait over tmtil an, 
other morning, as can the examination of table-linen. 
In cleaning any room after the furniture and carpets 
have been taked put and the dust swept out with a 
damp broom, the proper order is to begin with the 
ceiling, then take the walls and windows, and lastly 
the floor. Kalsomining or whitewash dries most 
quickly when exposed to free draughts of air, the 
windows being thrown wide open for the purpose; 
this process can also be aided by lighting a fire in the 
room, either in the stove left for the purpose, or in 
the grate. These means are equally good for dry- 
ing a freshly-scoured floor. 

In lieu of regulgr carpet wadding, layers of 



THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 295 

newspapers are very good padding under a carpet, 
or better yet, sheets of thick brown paper will an- 
swer very well. Mat ing and green linen shades are 
delightfully cool in either sitting or dining-room for 
summer use, or all through the hottest weather if 
the dining room can be left with a bare floor, and 
lightly washed oflF with cold water before breakfast 
each day it will add greatly to the coolness of the 
room. A. fire- place can be arranged w^ith a screen 
before it, or it can be left open, the fixtures taken 
away, and a large stone or pottery jar filled with 
fresh flowers daily set into it. Very showy flowers 
can in this w^ay be made effective in decorating a 
room. Jars covered with pictures of decalcomania 
are taw^dry-looking. Better far to paint them a dull 
black or bottle-green ; or a brick-red, with a plain 
band or geometric design traced in some contrasting 
color. 

In dining-room furniture oak wood w^itn green 
trimmings and light paint are good contrasting 
colors, w^hile black w^alnut or mahogany, with red 
carpet and shades of red predominating about the 
room, look well with dark paint. 

In arranging a sitting-room large spaces left 
empty look more comfortable and are more conven- 
ient in every way that a room huddled too full of 
furniture. A home is not a furniture wareroom nor 
a fancy bazaar,' but a place for people to live in, and 
grow in, one to move about in. 

House-cleaning time presents an opportunity for 
disposing of many ostensibly ornamental articles 
which only serve to fill up place, without being 
either beautiful or well made of their kind.

daubs. Good engravings and plain cheap frames are 
now obtained at such a trifling cost that almost 
every one can afford one or two excellent ones in 
their sitting-room. People, living at a distance can 
easily send to some large city for an engraving or 
two, or, if they, prefer colored pictures, to some well- 
known establishment for two orthreegood chromos. 
I have seen some of the best newspaper engravings 
pinned upon the sitting-room wall, framed in pressed 
ferns, with a very good effect indeed. Once a very 
simple bracket held a glass bumper of unique pat- 
tern, from which was trailed cypress vines, aud 
mingled with them, a bunch of scarlet lychnis. 
Against the white wall of the room they looked 
brilliant, and the effect was really beautiful. 

"When the sitting-room is torn up frequently an 
array of newspapers, missing books, etc. are found 
huddled together in some corner. In settling ,the 
room these shguld find their proper places, and it 
would be a good thing to keep them there ever' after, 
for, no matter how thorough the cleaning process, 
untidiness and litter will soon make any room ap- 
pear nearly as badly as before it was scoured. 

HOW TO DUST A ROOM. 

Soft cloths make the best of dusters. Jn dusting 
any piece of furniture begin at the top and dust 
down, wiping carefully with the cloth, which can be 
frequently shaken. A good many people seem to 
have no idea what dusting is intended to accomplish, 
and instead of wiping off and removing the dust it 
is simply flirted off into the air and soon settles 
down upon the articles dusted again. If carefully 
taken up hj the cloth it can be shaken off out of the 



THE EVERY DA.Y COOK BOOK. 297 

window into the open air. If the furniture will per- 
mit the use of a damp cloth, that will more easily 
take up the dust, and it can be washed out in a pail 
of soapsuds. It is far easier to save work by cover- 
ing up nice furniture while sweeping, than to clean 
the-dust out, besides leaving the furniture looking 
far better in the long run. The blessing of plainness 
in decoration is appreciated by the housekeeper who 
does her own work while dusting. 

GIRLS, LEARN TO COOK. 

Yes, yes, learn how to cook, girls ; and learn how 
to cook well. What right has a girl to marry and 
go into a house of her own unless she knows how^ to 
superintend every branch of housekeeping, and she 
cannot properly superintehd unless she has some 
practical knowledge herself. It is sometimes asked, 
sneeringly, "What kind of man is he w^ho would 
marry a cook ? " The fact is, that men do not think 
enough of this; indeed most men marry without 
thinking wrhether the woman of his choice is capable 
of cooking him a meal, and it is a pity he is so 
shortsighted, as his health, his cheerfulness, and, in- 
deed, his success in life, depend in a very great de- 
gree on the kind of food he eats : in fact, the whole 
household is influenced by the diet. Feed them on 
fried cakes, fried meats, hot bread and other indi- 
gestible viands day after day, and they will need - 
medicine to make them well. 

Let all girls have a share In housekeeping at 
home before they marry : let each superintend some 
department by turns. It need not occupy half the 
time to see that the house has been properly swept, 
dusted, and put in order, to prepare puddings and

make dishes, that many young ladies spend in read- 
ing novels which enenrate mind and body and unfit 
them for every-day life. Women do not, as a gen- 
eral rule, get pale faces doing housework. Their 
sedentary habits, in overheated rooms, combined 
with ill chosen food, are to blame for bad health. 
Our mothers used to pride themselves on their house- 
keeping and fine needlework. Let the present gen- 
eration add to its list of. accomplishments the art of 
properly pr^aring food for the human body- 

TEACH THE LITTLE ONES. 

There is scarcely a busy home mother in the land 
who has not at some time or other felt how much 
easier it would be to do all the work herself than to 
attempt to tea6h a child to assist her, whether it be 
in household matters or in sewing. Now, we speak 
particularly of the latter. But it seems almost the 
right of every little girl to be taught to sew neatly, 
even if it does cost the mother some self-sacrifice. 
Very few grown women are wholly exempt firom ever 
using a needle. On the contrary, almost every wo- 
man must take more or less care of her own war- 
drobe, even if she has no responsibility for that of 
any one's around her. Machines cannot sew up rips 
in gloves, replace missing buttons, or make or mend 
vrithout any needlework by hand. Some stitches 
must be taken, and how^ to sew^ neatly is an accom- 
plishment quite as necessary, if not more so, to the 
happiness of a majority of women than any other. 
If a little girl be early taught how to use her needle, 
it very soon becomes a sort of second nature to her, 
and very little ones can learn to thread the needle 
^d t^e simple s^^ches. Only the ^lother must be 



EVERY DAY COOR BOOK. 299 

patieat and painstaking with them, not letting poor 
work receive praise or permitting the child to slight 
what she undertakes. The stint can be a very short 
one with very little children. It is usually best so, 
but frequent lessons should be given. 

CHILDREN LOVE GAMES. 

Take advantage of this to give them physical 
training. Furnish them the apparatus for games 
which require a good deal of muscular exercise. 
Those curious little a£Fairs which require them to sit 
on the floor or gather about the table and remain in 
a cramped position, are not advisable. 

It is particularly desirable that the games should 
call them into the open air and sunshine. In this 
w^ay children lay in a stock of health and strength. 
Remember that, particularly in our younger j'ears, 
this is infinitely more important than all adornments 
of the person or study of books. 

Let it not be forgotton that symmetrical devel- 
opement of the body is of the utmost importance. 
A child, for example, is weak and round-shouldered. 
It is important that he should be made strong. It 
is not less important that he should be made straight. 
Every conceivable exercise may tend to increase the 
strength, but only special exercises tend to draw the 
shoulders back, and thus secure the rectitude which 
is the basis of spinal and visceral tone. It is not 
diflicult to give children such games and sports as 
w^ill have this special tendency. 

TEACH YOUR OWN CHILDREN. 

Some parents allow their children to acquire the 
rude and unmannerly habit of breaking in upon 



300 EVERY DAY COOK BOOK. 

their conversation and those of older persons with 
questions and remarks of their own. It is very un- 
civil to allow^ th^m to do so. So, even among their 
own brothers and sisters and schoolmates; of their 
own age, let them «peak without interrupting. If 
one begins to tell a story or bit of news, teach them 
to let him finish it ; and if he makes, mistakes that 
ought to be corrected, do it afterwards. Don't allow 
them to acquire the habit of being interrupters. 
Most of those who allow their own children to form 
this disagreeable habit will be exceedingly annoyed 
at the same conduct in other folks' children. The 
fault is that of the parents in not teaching their 
children. If they interrupt at home, tell them to 
wait till they ean converse without annoying, and 
see that they do-it. ' 

CULTITATING LESFISHNFSS IN CHIL- 
DREN. 

The mother who in the fhllness of generous love 
runs hither and thither continually to do for the var- 
ious members of the family those things which they 
should do themselves, comes to be regarded as a 
useful piece of machinery, suited to minister to their 
wants, but she is not regarded with one whit more 
of love or reverence, rather the reverse. By and by, 
when the mother is worn out in body and spirit, 
when the child, grown older, feels no need of her as 
slave, it finds other more attractive playmates and 
companions. 

The mother has necessarily far more labor, care 
and anxiety than any oi-her member of the house- 
hold. She is continually occupied, and her work 
seems to have no end. Neither husbaind nor children 



THE EVERY DAY COOK BOOK. 301 

will love her thejaore for sacxificing herself wholly 
to them, as many a sad, w^eary mother has learned 
to her cost. Let her be jnst to herself. Not that she , 
shotdd make slaves of the children any more than 
they should make a slave of her. But children like 
to be useful, like to feel that they are a real help to 
older persons, and if a little praise and perhaps, too, 
a little money is given them, they will learn to enjoy 
the pleasure of helping mother and of earning some- 
thing for themselves, and early taught the dignity of 
labor as w^ell as save their mother a little time to 
keep herself in advance of them in study and thought, 
in general information, and in spiritual growth, so 
as to be always reverenced as their intellectual and 
spiritual guide and iriend and counsellor. 

It has been truly said by Miss Sewell, author of 
an excellent w^ork on education, that "Unselfish 
mothers make selfish children." This may seem 
startling, but the truth is, that the mother who is 
continually giving up her own time, money, strength 
and pleasure for the gratification of her children 
teaches them to expect it always. They learn to be 
importunate in their demands, and to Expect more 
and more. If the mother wears an old dress that 
her daughter may have a new one, if she work that 
her daughter may play, she is helping to make her 
vain, selfish, and ignorant, and very likely she will 
be ungrateful and disrespectful, and this is equally 
true of the husband, and other members of the fam- 
ily. Unselfish wives make selfish husbands. 

PACKING AWAY FURS. 

All furs should be well switched and beaten lightly,- 
free from dust and loose hairs, well wraped in news 



302 THE EVERYDAY COOK BOOK. 

paper, with bits of camphor laid about them and in 
them, and put away in a cool dark place. If a cedar 
closet or chest is to be had, laid into that. In lieu of 
that new cedar chips may be scattered about. It is 
never well to delay packing furs away until quite 
late in the season, for the moth will early commence 
depredations. In packing them they should not be 
rolled so tightly as to be crushed and damaged. 

COURAGE. 

One may possess physical courage, so that in times 
of danger, a railroad accident, a steamboat collision 
or a runaway horse, the heart will not be daunted 
or the cheek paled, while on the other hand, one may 
be morally brave, not afraid to speak a wprd forthe 
right in season, though unwelcome, to preform a 
disagreeable duty unflinchingly or to refuse to do a 
wrong act, and yet be a physical coward, trembling 
and terrified in a thunder-storm, timid in the dark, 
and even scream at the sight of a mouse. Courage 
both moral and physical, is one of the finest attributes 
of character, and both can be cultivated and gained 
if desired and sought after. Some girls think it inter- 
esting and attractive to be ^terrified at insects, and 
will shriek with fright if they happen to be chased a 
few rodes by a flock of geese, but they only excite 
laughter and do not gain the admiration which a 
girl who tries to help herself would deserve. 

THE ART OF BEAUTY 1 DRESS. 

It is far easier to find fault with existing customs 
than to devise and put in practice other and better 
ones. J 

Ladies do not Uke to appear singular, and make 



EVERY DAY COOK BOOK. 

themselYCS conspicious by wearing such articles of 
dress as are laughed at, possibly, certainly jnot worn 
by any other persons in the city or country in which 
she may belong. And so the matter goes on. Manufac- 
turers, dry goods dealers, and milliners, and dress- 
makers, carry the day with a high hand. Yet there 
is alw^ays some choice, and as, thank to our civilized 
habits, a full-length mirror is obtainable by most 
ladies, given the resolution to make the most and 
best of themselves, the greater number of women can 
so study the art of dressing well as to produce some 
excellent results. 

It will hardy do to copy the old masters of paint- 
ing in the arrangement of drapery, at last anyways 
closely, for no matter how well the voluminous folds 
may look painted, they cirtainly w^ould be very much 
in the way in real life, and impede any free action of 
the muscles somewhat, while the lenght of sweeping 
gowns certainty looks more in place on pahited can- 
vas than it can do on an ordinary walking dress. 
Ladies have realized this fact, however, and the short 
walking-skirt, at once pretty and convenient, has 
been the restdt. 

In some places the common sense shoe can be 
fotmd, and this permits the muscles of the foot, if 
not the freest, yet fair play. One great mistake in 
dressing of the feet is in getting the covering to 
short. It will throw back the toe joints, and a bun- 
ion is only too frequently the result. If the soles of 
the shoes are to thin, the feet become chilled, and 
disease ensues. Yet in repeated instances they have 
been known to draw the feet and make them exceed- 
ingly tender and sore. A light corksole sewed to a 
knitted worsted slipper will give a foot covering, 
equally light and far less injurious in its result. 



364 f HE EVfiRYbAt dOOtC fiOOK. 

There are ladies wjio wholly ignore woolen ho- 
siery, preferring lisle thread, cotton or silk. Yet in 
winter time, particularly for children, woolen stock- 
ings are almost a necessity, particularly if woman is 
worn over the rest of the bodjr. There are some 
people w^ho can not alDide the feeling of woolen gar- 
ments next the skin, and they are obliged to get their 
warmth of clothing in other than their undergar- 
ments. Heavy outside garments are not quite so 
graceful as those of softer and lighter material. But 
if they must be worn they will bear a|plainercuttfaan 
such clothes as are naturally clinging, and adapt 
themselves to the figure. 

Solid and plain colors have a greater richness 
than mixed shades. If combined tints are used, they 
^ should only be such as harmonize well, and in the 
lull-lenght figure give a good personal effect. Pro- 
bably more ladies err in getting good general effects 
than in any other one particular. They have 
various garments, pretty enough, possibly, in them- 
selves, yet which do not harmonize well together, 
either in material, color or cut, or possibly with 
their particular style of figure and shade of hair and 
complexion. For example, the skirt will have one 
style of trimming, Xhe w^aist another, the bonnet- 
may Iciok exceedingly well with one suit, and be 
quiteout of keeping with another. A short dumpy 
person will wear flounces, a tall slim one stripes, 
while some red-haired women will fancy an exqusite 
shade of silk, while green or blue would have been 
much more becoming. 

Black generally makes people look smaller, and 
white larger. A very pale person can bear a certain 
amount of bright red. Any delicate complexion looks 



tHE EVfiRVDAY COOKfiOOfc. 3(M 

well with soft rucKings or laces at neck and wrist. 
Lace is so expensive that it cannot be so generally 
worn as it might be, with excellent effect. Probably 
no prettier head covering has ever been designed 
that the veils worn by the Spanish woman. Certain- 
ly they are infinitely more graceful than a modern 
poke bonnet. 

Dress goods cut up into little bits and sewed to. 
gether into fantastical shapes called trimmings, are 
apt if too frpelyused to give an air of ftissiness to the 
dress, and be withal a source of endless annoyance in 
catching dust and dirt. The former ideas of a border 
or hem to finish has become thegreater part of the 
garment. 

Nothing is gained in grace by making any outside 
garment skin-tight, while much is lost in comfort by 
so doing. A sleeve, for instance, to be serviceable 
and look w^ell, should be loose and adapt itself some- 
w^hatto curve of the arm. Likewise a dress waist 
looks far better a little loose, as well as being health- 
full and wearing better. 

Large, stout persons can add to their appearance 
much by wearing all outside skirts buttoned on to 
fited undergarments below the hips several inches, 
for gathers about the waist only add to their stout- 
ness of look and are uncomfortable to carry about. 
A yoked petticoat answers the purpose very well in 
lieu of the buttoned skirts. 

A wrapper for a tall slim person can have a Spanish 
flounce, while a slashed skirt with kilt inserts is 
more becoming to a short figure. Large folds are al- 
ways more graceful than small pleats and puckers. 
One very great fault of our dressmaking hes in not 



306 fiVERV DAY COOK BOOK. 

allowing the goods to fall In large and natural folds, 
but in bunching and pleating it in folding, and press- 
ing the goods down into fantastic and inartistic 
shapes. Added to this, paniers, and padding, bustles, 
and hoops, until an ordinary woman is forced to ap- 
pear like a stuflFed^ figure instead of a living human 
being. 

Every woman can modify, and arrange, and simp- 
lify, and that without becoming either ultra or con- 
spicuous. It will take time. That cannot be helped, 
yet possibly the saving in comfort and expense may 
fiiUy compensate for the few hours spent in studying 
her own dress with the mirror before her and with 
the,determination to make the verv best and most of 
herself. 

HOME DRESSMAKING. 

The art of dressmaking in America has been of late 
years so simplified that almost anyone with a reas- 
onable degree of excutive ability can manufacture a 
fashionable custom by using an approved pattern and 
following the directions printed upon it, selecting a 
new pattern for each disbinct style; while in Europe 
many ladies adhere to the old plan of cutting one 
model and usingit foreverything, trusting to personal 
skill or luck to gainthe desired formation. However, 
some useful hints are given which are w^ell w^orth off- 
ering after the paper pattern has been chosen. 

The best dressmakers here and abroad use silk for 
lining, but nothing is so durable or preserves the 
material as a firm slate twill. This is sold double 
with and should be laid out thus folded: place the 
pattern upon it with the upper part towards the cut 
end, the selvedge for the fronts. The side pieces for 
the |back will most probably be got out of the with, 



THE EVERY DA.Y COOK BOOK. 307 

wfjilc the top of the back will fit in the intersect of 
the front. A yard of good stuff may be often saved 
by laying tbe pattern out and well considering how 
one part cuts into another. Prick th«- outline on to 
the lining; these marks serve as a guide for the tack- 
ing. 

In forming the front side plaits be careful and do 
not allow a fold or crease to be apparent on the bo- 
dice beyond where the stiching commences. To 
avoid this, before beginning stick a pin through what 
is to be the top of the plait. The head will be on the 
right side, and holding the point, one can begin pin- 
ning the seam without touching the upper part of 
the bodice. To ascertain the size of the buttonholes 
put a piece of card beneath the button to be used and 
cut it an eighth of an inch on either side bey or d. 
Having turned down the piece in front on the button- 
hole side run a thread a sixteenth of an inch from 
the extreme edge, and again another the width of 
the card. Begin to cut the first buttonhole at the bot- 
tom of the bodice, and continue at equal distances.- 
The other side of the bodice is left wide enough to 
come w^eU under the buttonholes. The buttonholes 
must be laid upon it and a pin put through the cen- 
tre of each to mark where the buttonhole is to be 
placed. In, sew^ing on the buttons put the stitches 
on horizontally; if perpendicularly, they are likely 
to pucker that side of the bodice so much that it 
will be quite drawn up, and the buttons will not 
match the buttonholes. 

A WOMAN'S SKIRTS. 

Observe the extra fatigue which is insured to every 
woman in merely carrying a tray upstairs, frsm the 



SOa BVfiRY DAY G0OK B06K. 

skirts of the dress. Ask any young women who are 
studying to pass examinations whether they do not 
find loose clothes a sine qua non while pouring over 
their books, and then realize the harm we are doing 
ourselves and the race by habitually lowering our 
powers of life and energy in such a manner. As a 
matter of fact it is doubtful whether any persons 
have ever been found who would say that their stays 
were at all tight; and, indeed, by a muscular con- 
traction they can apparently prove that they are 
not so by moving them about on themselves, and 
thus probably believe what they say. That they are 
in error all the a.ame they can easily assure them- 
selves by first measuring around the waist outside 
the stay: then take them off, let them measure while 
they take a deep breath, with the tape merely laid 
on the body as if measuring for the quantity of braid 
to go around a dress, and mark the result. The in- 
jury done by stays is so entirely internal that it is 
not strange that the maladies caused by wearing them 
should be attributed to every reason under the sun 
except the true one, which is, briefly, that all the 
internal organs, being by them displaced, are doing 
their work imperfectly and under the least advanta- 
^ous conditions, and are, therefore, exactly in the 
state most favorable to the development of disease, 
whether hereditary or otherwise. — Maxwillan's 
Magazixte. 

TO MAKE THE SLEEVES. 

As to sleeves. Measure from the shoulder to the 
elbow and again from the elbow to the wrist. Lay 
these measurements on any sleeve patterns you may 
have, and lengthen or. shorten accordingly. The 
sleeve is eut in two pieces, the top of the arm and the 



THX BVBRYDAY COOK BOOK. 309 

under part, which is about an inch narrower than the 
outside. In joining the two together, if the sleeve is 
at all tight, the upper part is slightly fulled to the 
lower at the elbow. The sleeve is sewed to the armr 
hole with no cordings now, and the front seam 
should be about two inches in front of the bodice. 

Bodices are now worn very tight-fitting, and the 
French stretch the material well on the cross before 
beginning to cut out, and in cutting allow the lining 
to be slightly pulled, so that when on, the outside 
stretches to it and insures a better fit. An experi. 
enced eye can tell a French-cut bodice at once, the 
front side pieces being always on the cross. In dress 
cutting and fitting, as in evetything else, there are 
failures and discouragements, but practice overrules 
these little matters, and " trying again" brings a 
sure rew^ard in success. 

A sensible suggestion is made in regard to the 
finish in necks of dresses for morning wear. Plain 
colors have rather a stifiF appearance, tulle or crepe 
lisse frilling are expensive and frail, so it is a good 
idea to purchase a few yards of really good washing 
lace, about an inch and a half in depth ; quill or 
jilate and cut into suitable lengths to tack round the 
necks of dresses. This can be easily removed and 
cleaned when soiled. A piece of soft black Spanish 
lace, folded loosely round the throat close to the 
frillings, but below it, looks very pretty : or you may 
get three yards of scarf lace, trim the ends with 
frillings, place it around the neck, leaving nearly all 
the length in the right hand, the end lying upon the 
left shoulder being about half a yard Ipng. Wind 
the larger piece twice round the throat, in loose, soft 
folds, and festoon the other yard and a half, and fas- 
tea with brooch or flower at the aide— P& ff a dg/p AiB

oven after the bread is drawn, or into a stove oven, and steam 
the moisture from them. Grind coarsfely. Now pour upon the 
ground malt 3^ gallons of water at 170 or 172° of ^eat. The 
tub ia which you scald the malt should have a false bottom, 2 
or three inches from the real bottom; the false bottom should be

bitter, then ferment in the usual manner. The -wood sage is 
the best substitute for hops, and being free from any anodyne

six pounds of unslaked lime, and boil twenty minutes. l,et ft 
cool and settle, and then pour oflf the clear liquor very carefully 
and mix it with the soap solutibn. It improves it very much to 
add one quart of alcohol after mixing the two solutions. Smaller 
quantities can be made in the same proportions. If too strong, 
add water to suit

adding whiting, and it may be used on brass, copper, German 
silver, ect. 

Cement for Aquaria. — Many persons have attempted to make 
aqum'iuins, but have failed on account of the extreme difSeulty 
in making the tank resist the action of water for any length of 
time. Below is a recipe for a cement that can be relied upon;

plants; it sticks to glass, metal, weed, stone, etc., and ^lardetis 
underwater. A hundred different experiments witk cement 
have been tried, but there is nothing like it It is the same as 
that used in constructing the tanks used in the Zoological Car< 
dens, Iiondon, and is almost unknown in this country. One 
part, by measure, say a gill, of litharge; one gill of poster of 
Paris; one gill of dry, white sand; one-third of a gill of finely- 
powdered resin. Sift and keep corked tight until required for 
use, when it is to be made into a putty by mixing in boiled oil 
(linseed) with a little patent dryer added Never use it after it 
has been mixed (that is, with the oil) over fifteen honts. This 
cement can be used for marine as well as fresh water aqaaria, 
as it resists the action of salt water. The tank can be used 
immediately, but it is best to give it three or four hours to cby. 

Cement fer Attaching Metal to Glass, — ^Take two ounces of a 
thick solution of glue, and mix it vrith one ounce of lins««d-oil 
varnish, and half an ounce of pure turpentine; the whole are 
then boiled together in a close vessel. Tho two bodies should 
be clamped and held together for about two days after they are 
united, to allow the cement to become dry. The claaips may 
then be removed. 

Cement for Mending Broken China. — Stir plaster of Paris into a 
thick solution of gum arable, till it becomes a viscous paato. 
Apply it with a brush to the fractured edges, uid draw the parts 
closely together. 

Cement for Mending Steam Boilers. — ^Mix two parts of finely 
powdered litharge with one part of very fine sand, and one part 
of quicklime which has been allowed to slack spontaneously by 
exposure to the air. This mixture may be kept for any length 
of time without injury. In using it a portion is mixed into paste 
with linseed oil, or, still better, boiled linseed oil. In this state 
it must be quickly applied, as it soon becomes hard. 

Cheap Galvanic Battery. — Take a cylindrical vessd, and put an- 
other of porous porcelain inside of it; fill the vessel with dilated 
sulphwc acid, and the space between the two with sulphate e( 
copper (if you require to plate the article with copper); if not, a 
solution of the salt of gold, silver, etc., according to that wUch 
yon wish it to be; put a slip of zinc in thesulphni4ca^,and 
attadi a copper wire to it, and the other end to liiw metal or 



a BOOK OP KNOWLEDGE. 

other article you wish to plate, and immerse that in the other 
solution. Your battery is now complete. If you want the cop- 
per to be very thick, you must put a few solid crystals of copper 
in the solution; where you do not want it to come in contact, 
you must touch it with a little grease; if you want to take the 
copper off the article, you must do it over with a slight varnish. 

Cheap White Hoase Paint — ^Take skim milk, two quarts, eight 
ounces fresh slaked lime, six ounces linseei oil, . two ounces 
white Burgundy pitch, three pounds Spanish white. Slake the 
lime in water, expose it to the air, and mix in about one-%uarter 
of the milk; the oil, in which the pitch is previously dissolved 
to be added, a little at a time; then the rest of the milk, and 
afterwards the Spanish white. This quantity is sufficient for 
thirty square yards, two coats, and costs but a few cents. If the 
. other colors are wanted, use, instead of Spanish white, other 
coloring matter. 

Composition for House-Roofs. — Take one measure of fine sand, 
two of sifted wood-ashes, an^ three of lime, ground up with oil. 
Mix thoroughly, and lay on with ' a painter's brush, first a thij 
coat and then a thick one. This composition is not only cheap, 
but it strongly resists fire. 

Diamond Cement. — Isinglass, one ounce; distilled vinegar, five 
and a half ounces; spirits of wine, two ounces; gum ammoniacum, 
half an ounce, gum mastic, half an ounce. Mix well. 

French Polish. — To one pint of spirits of wine, add a quarter ol 
an ounce of gum copal,, quarter of an ounce of gum arable, and 
one ounce of shellac. Let the gums be well bruised, and sifted 
through a piece of muslin. Put the spirits and the gums to- 
gether in a vessel that can be closely corked; place them near'a 
warm stove, and frequently shake them; in two or three days 
they will be dissolved; strain the mixture through a piece of 
muslin, and keep it tightly corked for use. 

Furniture Oil for Polishing and Straining Mahogany. — Take of 
linseed oil, one gallon; alkanet root, three ounces; rose pink, one 
ounce. Boil them together ten minutes, and strain so that the 
o"il will be quite clear. The furnituire should be well rubbed with 
it every day until the polish is brought up, which will be more 
durable than any other.

mix. add a pint of gum arable, finely powdered. This will make 
furniture look 'almost as good as new, and can be easily applied, 
as it requires no rubbing. The bottle should be shaken, and 
the polish poured on a rag and applied to the furniture. 

Glue tor ready Use. — To any quantity of glue use common 
whiskey instead of water. Put both together in a bottle, cork 
tight, and set it away for three or four days, when it will be fit 
for use without the application of heat. 

A Quart of Ink for a Dime. — Buy extract of logwood, which may 
be had at three cents an ounce, or cheaper by the quantity. Buy 
also, for three cents, an ounce of bi-chromate of potash. Do not 
make a mistake, and get the simple chromate of potash. The 
former is orange red, and the latter clear yellow. Now, take 
half an ounce of extract of logwood and ten grains of bi-chro 
mate of potash, and dissolve them in a quart of hot rain water 
When cold, pour it into a glass bottle, and leave it uncorked fp» 
a week or two. Exposure to the air is indispensable. The ink 
)« then made, and has cost five to ten minutes' labor, and about 
three cents, besides the bottle. The ink is at first an intense 
«teel blue, but becomes quite black. 

An Excellent Substitute for Ink.— Vut a couple of iron naila into 
« teaspoonful of vinegar. - In half an hour pour in a tablespoon- 
ful of strong tea, and then you will have ink enough for a while. 

Ink, First-Hate ff/ac*.— Take twelve pounds of bruised galls, 
five pounds of gum Senegal, five pounds of green sulphate of 
iron, and twelve gallons of rain water. Boil the galls with nine 
gallons of water for three hours, adding fresh water to replace 
what is lost by evaporation. Let the decoction settle, and draw 
off the clear liquor; add to it a strained solution of the gum; dis- 
solve also the sulphate of iron separately, and mix the whole. 

Another. — Galls, three pounds; sulphate of iron, one pound; 
logwood, half a pound; gum half a pound; ale, four gallona 
Let it stand in loosely corkei bottles in a warm place for 3 week 
or two, shaking it daily.

applied to the cloth before writing, is composed of one ounce of 
peorlash, dissolved in four ounces of water, with a little gum 
arable dissolved in it. Wet the spot with this; dry and iron the 
cloth; then write. 

3. Nitrate of silver, five scruples; gum arabic, two drachms; 
sap green, one scruple; distilled water, one ounce. Mix together. 
Before writing on the article to be marked, apply a little of the

Ink, Indesiructible. — On many occasions itis of importami* to 
employ an ink indestructable by any prscess, that will act 
equally destroy the material on which it is applied. For black 
ink, twenty-five grains of copal, in powder, are te be dissolved 
in two hundred grains of oil of lavender, by the assistance of a 
gentle heat, and ate then to be mixed with two and a half grains 
of latap-black and half a grain of indigo. This ink is particu- 
larly useful for labelling phials, etc., containing chemical 
substances of a corrosive nature. 

Ink, for Marking Linen with Type. — Dissolve one part of asphal- 
tum in four parts of oil of turpentine, and lamp-black or black- 
lead, in fine powder, in sufficient quantity to render of proper 
consistency to print with type. 

Ink Powder for Immediate Use. — Reduce to powder ten ouncss 
of gall-nuts, three ounces of green copperas, two ounces each of 
powdered alum and gum arable put, |a little of this mixture into 
white wine, and it will be fit for immediate use. 

Ink Stains. — The moment the ink is spilled, take a little milk, 
and saturate the stain, soak it up with a rag, and apply a little 
more milk, rubbing it well in. In a few minutes the ink will be 
completely removed. 

Red Ink. — ^Take of the raspings of Brazil weed, quarter of a 
pound, and infuse them two or three days in colorless vinegar. 
Boil the infusion one hour and a half over a gentle fire, and after- 
ward filter it while hot, through paper laid in an earthenware 
cullender. Put it again over the fire, and disselve in it first 
half an ounce of gum arable, and afterward sf alum and white 
sugar each half an ounce. Care should be taken that the Brazil 
wood be not adulterated with the Braziletto or Campeachy wood. 

Resin-oil Ink. — Melt together thirteen ounces of resin, ene 
pound of resin-oil, and sue and a half ounces of soft soap. When 
cold, add lamp-black.

parts; mix together and write with a quill pen, which writiag 
«aK> be read only after beating iU 



a6 BOOK OF KN0WLEBGE. 

Sympathetic or Secret Inks. — Mix equal quantities of sulpiiate 
of copper aud sal ammoniac, and dissolve in water. Writing 
done -with this ink is invisible until the paper is heated, when 
it turns a yellow color. Lemon juice, milk, juice of onions, and 
some other liquids become black when the writing is held to 
the fire. 

Transfer Ink. — Mastic in tears, four ounces; shellac, six ounces; 
Venice turpentine, half an ounce; melt together, add wax, half 
a pound; tallow, three ounces. When dissolved further add 
hard tallow soap (in shavings), three ounces; and when the 
whole is combined, add lamp-black two ounces. Mix well, cool 
a little, and then pour it into molds. This ink is rubbed down 
with a little water in a cup or saucer, in the same way as water 
color cakes. In winter, the operation should be performed near 
the fire. 

Indian Glues, — ^Take one pound of the best glue, the stronger 
the beter, boil it and strain it very clear; boil also four ounces 
of isinglass- put the mixture into a double glue pot, add half a 
pound of brown sugar, and boil the whole until it gets thick; 
then pour it into thin plates or molds, and when cold you may 
cut and dry them in small pieces Tor the pocket. The glue is 
ased by merely holding it over steam, or wetting it with the 
mouth. Thi^ is a most useful and convenient article, being 
much stronger than comnion glue. It is sold under the name 
of Indian glue, but is much less expensive in making, and is 
applicable to all kinds of small, fractures, etc.; answers well on 
the hardest woods, and cements, china, etc., though, of~course, it 
will not resist the action of hot water. For parchment and 
paper, in lieu of gum or paste, it will be found equally con- 
venient. 

Japanese Cement. — Intimately mix the best powdered rice with 
a little cold water, then gradually add- boiling water until ^ 
proper consistence is acquired, bemg particularly careful to keep 
it well stirred all the time ; lastly, it must be boiled for one min- 
ute in a clean saucepan or earthern pipkin. This glue is beauti- 
fully white and almost transparent, for which reason it is well 
adapted for fancy paper work, which requires a strong and col. 
orless cement.

Mahogany Stain. — Break two ounces ofdragon's blood in pieces, 
and put them in a quart of rectified spirits of wine; let the bottle 
stand in a wajm place, and shake it frequently. When dissolved, 
it is fit for use, and will render common wood an excellent im- 
itation of mahogany. 

Marine Olue. — Dissolve four parts of india-rubber in thirty-four 
|jarts of coal tar naphtha, aiding the solution with Jheat and 
agitation. The solution is then thick as cream, and it should be 
added to sixty-four parts of powdered shellac, which must be 
heated in the mixture till ai; is dissolved. While the mixture is 
hotit is poured on plates ol metal, in sheets like leather. It can

Parchment — Paper parchment may be produced by immerang 
paper in a coacentratic solution of choloride of zinc. 

Silifer Plating Fluid. — Bissalve sne ounce of nitrate of silver in 
«ystal, in twelve ounces of soft water; then dissolve in the water 
two ounces cyanuret of potash, shake the whole together, and 
let it stand till it becomes clear. Have ready some half ounce 
vials, and fill half full of Par^s white, or fine whiting, and then 
fill up the bottles with the liquor and it is ready for use. The 
whiting does not increase the coating power — it only helps to 
clean the articles, and to save the silver fluid by half filling the 
bottle. 

Amalgam of Gold. — Place one part of gold in a small iron sauce- 
pan or ladle, perfectly clean, then add eight parts of mercury, 
and apply a gentle heat, when the gold will dissolve; agitate the 
mixture for one minute, and pour it out on a clean plate or stona 
slab. 

For gilding brass, copper, etc. The metal to be gilded is firs* 
rubbed over with a solution of nitrate of mercury, and then cov- 
ered over with a thin film of the amalgam. On heat being ap- 
plied the mercury volatilizes, leaving the gold behind. 

A much less proportion of gold is often employed than the 
above, where a very thin and cheap gilding is required, as by 
increasing the quantity of the mercury, the precious metal may 
be extended over a much larger surface. A similar amalgam 
prepared with silver is used for silvering. 

Amalgam for Mirrors, — Lead and tin, each one ounce; bismuth, 
two ounces; mercury, f6ur ounces; melt as before, and add the 
mercury. These are used to silver mirrors, glass globes, etc., 
by warming the glass, melting the amalgam, and applying it 

Annealing Steel. — i. For a small quantity. Heat the steel to a 
cherry red in a charcoal fire, then bury in sawdust, in an iron 
box; covering the sawdust with ashes. Let stay until cold.— 
2. For a larger quantity, and when it is required to be very * 'soft." 
Pack the steel with cast iron (lathe or plainer) chips in an iron 
■box, as fellows: Having at least }4 ox )4 inch in depth of chips 
in the bottom of box, put in a layer of steel, then more chips to 
fill spaces between the steel, and also the J4 or X iuch space be« 
iween the sides of box and steel, then more steel; and lastly, at 
least I iacb in depth of chips, well rammed down on top of ^eeL

To make Bell Metal. — i. Melt together under powdered char- 
coal, 100 parts of pure copper, with 20 parts of tin, and unite 
the two metals by frequently stirring the mass. Product very 
fine. — 2. Copper 3 parts; tin i part; as above. Some of the finest 
church bells in the world have this composition. — 3. Copper 2 
parts; tin i part; as above. — 4. Copper 72 parts; tin 26^ parts; 
iron i}4 parts. The bells of small clocks or pendules are made 
of this alloy In Paris. 

Brass to Maxe. i. Fine Brass. — 2 parts of copper to i part of 
zinc. This is nearly one equivalent each of copper and zinc, if 
the equivalent of the former metal be taken at 63-2; or 2 equi- 
valents of copper to i equivalent of zinc, if it be taken with 
Liebig and Berzelius, at 31-6. 

2. Copper 4 parts; zinc, r part. An excellent and very useful 
brass. 

Cleansing Solution for- Brass. — Put together two ounces sul. 
phuric acid, an ounce and a half nitric acid, one drachm salt- 
petre and two ounces rain water. Let stand for a few hours, 
and apply by passing the article in and out quickly, and then 
washing oflF thoroughly with clean rain water. Old discolored 
brass chains treated in this way will look equally as well as 
when new. The usual method of drying is in sawdust. 

To Coyer Brass with beautiful Lustre Colors. — One ounce of 
cream of tartar is dissolved in one quart of hot water, to which 
is added half an ounce of tin salt (protochloride of tm) dissolved 
in four ounces of cold water. The whole is then heated to boil- 
ing, the clear solution decanted from a trifliBg precipitate, and 
poured under continual stirring into a solution of three ounces 
hyposulphite of soda in one-half a pint of water, whereupon it is 
again heated to boiling, and filtered from the separated sulphiu:. 
This solution produces oa brass the various luster-colors, de- 
pending on the length of time during which the articles are al- 
lowed to stay in it, The colors at first will be light to dark gold 
yellow, passing through all the tints of red to an irrideeeent 
brov n. A similar series of colors is produced by sul J]*ide of 
copper and lead, which, however, are not remarkable for their 
stability; whether this defect will be obviated by the use of the 
Iki solution, experience and time alone can show.

Bronting Gun-Bamls.-~Th.c so-called Itutter of zinc used old 
for branzimg guu-1»arrel8 is made by dissolriiig zinc in hydro, 
chlaric acid till no more free acid is left; which is sectured by 
- placing zinc ia the acid until it ceases to be dissolved. The 
liquid is &en evaporated until a drop taken out and placed en 
a piece of glass solidifies in cooling, when it is mixed with two 
parts of olive.eil for every three parts of the liquid. The barreli 
must be cleansed and warmed before applying the so-called bu^

To S»tttn east-lren, for BrHling. — Heat to a cherry red, having 
it lie level in the fire, then with a pair-of cold tongs put on a 
meee of brimstone, a little less in size than you wish the hole to 
be when drilled, and it softens entirely through the piece; let it 
lie in the fire until a little cool, when it is ready to drill. 

To Weld Cust-lrep. — Take of good clear white sand, three parts; 
refined solton, one part; festeriue, one part; reck salt, one part ; 
mix all together. Take two. pieces of cast-iron, heat them in a 
moderate charcoal-fire, occasionally taking them out while heati 
ing, and dipping them into the composition, until they are of a 
proper heat to weld, then at once lay them on the anvil, and 
gently hammer them together, and, if done carefully by one 
who understands welding iron, you will have them nicely wel- 
ded together, ®ne man prefers heating the metal, then cooling 
it in the water of common beans, and heat it again for welding,

into an ir»a box, and covered with animal or vegetable charcoal, 
and cemented at a red heat, for a period varying • with the size 
and description of the articles operated on. 

2. Cow's horn or hoof is to be baked or thoroughly dried, and 
pulverized. To this add an equal quantity of bay salt; mix them 
with stale chamber-lye, or white wine vinegar; cover the iron 
with this mixture, and bed it in the same in loam, or inclose it 
in an iron box; lay it then on the hearth of the forge to dry and 
harden; then put it into the fire, and blow till the lump has a 
blead-red heat, and no higher, lest the mixture be burnt too 
laach. Take the iron out, and immerse it in water to harden. 

3. The iron previously polished and finished, is to be heated 
to a bright red and rubbed or sprinkled over with prussiate of 
p«tash. As soon as the prussiate appears to be decomposed and 
3isdpated, plunge the article into cold water. 

4. Make a paste with a concentrated solution of prussiate of 
potash and loam, and coat the iron therewith; then expose it to 
) strong red heat, and when it has fallen to a dull red, plunge 
die whole into cold water. 

Te recuf old Files and Hasps. — Dissolve 4 ounces of saleratns in 
I qaart of water, and boil the files in it for half an henr; then 
remove, wash, and dry them. Now have ready, in a glass or 
stone ware vessel, l quart of rain water, into which you have 
slowly added 4 ounces of best sulphuric acid, and keep the pro- 
portions for any amount used. Immerse the files in this pre- 
paration for from six to twelve hours, according to fineness or 
coarseness of the file; then remove, wash them clean, dry 
quickly, and put a little sweet oil on them to cover the surface. 
If the files are coarse, they will need to remain in about twelve 
hours, but for fine files six to eight hours is sufficient This plan 
is applicable to blacksmiths', gunsmiths', tinners', coppersmiths' 
and machinists' files. Copper and tin w6rkers will only require 
a short time to take the articles out of their files, as the soft 
metals with which they become filled are soon dissolved. Black- 
anuths' and saw-mill files require full time. Files may be re-cut

Chinese Uethod of Mending Holes in Iron. — The Chiaese saead 
boles in cast-iron vessels as folk>ws: They melt a small quantity 
of iron in a crucible the size of a thimble, and ponr the molten 
metal on a piece of felt covered with wood-ashes. This is pressed 
inside the vessel against the hole, and as it exudes en the other 
side it is struck by a small roll of feh covered with ash«s. The 
new iron then adheres to tie old. 

Common Pewter, — Melt in a crucible 7 pounds of tin, and when 
fused throw in, i pound of lead, 6 oz. of copper and 2 oz. ef zinc. 
-This cembiaation of metal will form an alloy of great durability 
and tenacity; also of considerable lustre. 

Best Pewter. — ^The best sort of pewter consists of 100 parts of 
tin, and 17 of regulus ef antimony. 

Hard Pewter. — Melt together^ia pounds of tin, i pound of r^

StUer, to Adhere to Brass or Copper.— Prepare a soldering solu- 
tion in this way : Pour a small quantity of muriatic acid on some 
zinc filings, so as to completely cover the zinc. Let it stand 
about an hour, and then pour off the acid, to which add twice 
its amount of water By first wetting the brass or copper with 
this preparation, the solder will readily adhere. 

Common Solder. — Put into a crucible 2 lbs. of lead, and when 
melted throw in l pound of tin. T&is alloy is that generally 
known by the name of solder. When heated by a hot iron and 
applied to tinned iron with powdered resin, it acts as a cement or 
solder. 

Tempering Stee/.—Poz tempering many kinds of tools, the 
steel is first hardened by heating it to a cherry red, and plung- 
ing it into cold water. AAerward the temper is drawn by 
moderately heating the steel again. Different degrees of hard- 
ness are required for different purposes, and the degree of heat 
for each of these, with the corresponding color, will be found in 
the annexed table. 

Very pale straw color, 4$eP — ^the temper required for lancets. 

A shade of darker yellow, 450° — for razors and surgical instru- 
ments. 

Darker straw-yellow, 470° — for penknives. 

Still darker yellow, 490° — chisels for cutting iron. 

A brown yellow 500° — axes and plane-irons. 

Yellow, slightly tinged with purple, °52o— table-knives and 
watch-springs. 

Tempering Liquid. — i. To 6 quarts soil water put in corrosive 
sublimate, I oz.; common salt, 2 handfuls ; when dissolved it is 
ready for use. The first gives toughness to the steel, while the 
latter gives the hardness. Be careful with this preparatian, as 
it is a dangereus poison. — 2. Salt, yi tea-cup ; saltpetre, }i oz. ; 
alum, pulverized. l tea-spoon; soft water, i gallon ; never heat 
over a cherry red, nor draw any temper. — ^3. Saltpetre, sal-am-

boil ten minutes longer; at the end v. ' that time turn it into tin 
molds or pans, and let them remain . <veeL .r ten days to dry; 
then turn them out of the molds. If you w isu to have the soap 
scented, stir into it an essential oil that has r~si agreeable smell, 
just before you turn it into the molds. This kind of soap is ex- 
cellent for shaving, and for chapped bands^ it is also good for 
eruptions on the face. It will be fit for use In the conrse of 
three or four weeks after it is made, but it is better for being 
kept ten or twelve or months. 

Chemical Sofip, (fortakingOil,Orease, etc., from Cloth |— Take 
fiveponndsofcastile soap, cut fine; one pint alcohol; one pint 
soft water; two ounces aquafortis; one and a half ounces lamp- 
black; two ounces of saltpetre; three ounces potash; one ounce 
of camphor; and four ounces of cinnamon, in powaer. First 
dissolve the soap, potash and saltpetre, by boiling; tnen add alt 
the other aiticles,and continue to stir until it cools; then pour in- 
to a box and tet it stand twenty-four hours and cut into cakes 

Cold Soap. — Mix twenty-six pounds of melted and straiueo 
grease with four pailfuls of ley made of twenty ponads of white 
petssh. Let the whole stand in the sun, stirrins it frequently. 
In the course of the week, fill the barrel with weak ley. 

Genuine Erasive Soap. — Two pounds of good castile soap; half 
a pound of carbonate of potash; dissolve in half a pint of hot 
water. Cut the soap in thin slices, and boil the soap with the 
potash until it is thick enough to mould in cakes; also add 
. alcohol, half an ounce; camphor, half an ounce; hartshorn,- halt 
an ounce; color with half an ounce of pulverized charcoal. 

Hard White Soap.— to fi^een pounds of lard or suet, made trail- 
ing hot, add slowly six gallons of hot lye, or solution of potash, 
that will bear up an egg high enough to leave a piece big as a 
shilling bare. Take out a little, and cool it If n<» grease rise 
it is done. If any grease appears, add tye, and boil till no 
grease rises. Add three quarts of fine salt, and t)oil up again.

LaboT'Saring Soap, — ^Take two pounds of sal-soda, two poands 
of yellow bar soap, and ten quarts of water. Cut the soap in 
■fain slices, and boil together for two hours; strain, and it will be 
U for use. Put the clothes in soak the night before you wash, 
jnd to every pail of'water in which you boil them, add a pound 
of soap. They will need no rubbing, merely rinse them out, 
and they w"ll be perfectly clean and white. 

To Make Good Soap. — ^To make matchless soap, take one gallon 
of soft soap, to which add a gill of common salt, and boil an 
hour. When cold, separate the lye from the crude. Add to the 
crude two pounds of sal soda, and boil in two gallons of soft 
water till dissolved. If you wish it better, slice two pounds of 
common bar soap and dissolve in the above. If the soft soap 
makes more than three pounds of crude, add in proportion to 
the sal soda and watet. 

To make Hard Soap trom Soft.— Take seven pounds of good 
soft soap; four pounds sal soda; two ounces borax; one ounce 
hartshom;half apound of resin; to be dissolved in twenty-two 
quarts of water, and boiled about twenty minutes. 

mate Oil Soap, (for the destmctioa of insects.) — rteuac com- 
mon lye caustic, by boiling it at full strength on quicklime; 
then take the lye and boil it with as much whale oil foot as it 
will saponify (change to soap), pour off into moulds, and, when 
cold, it is tolerably hard. Whale oil foot is the sediment pro- 
duced in refining whale oil, and is worth two dollars per barrel. 

Soluble Class.— 'Mis ten parts of carbonate of potash, fifteen 
parts of powdered quartz, and one pound of charcoal. Fuse 
well together. The mass is soluble in four or five parts of boil- 
ing water, and the filtered solution, evaporated to dryne», yields 
a transparant glass, permanent in the air. 

Tracing Paper. — In order to prepare a beautiful transparent, 
colorless paper, it is best to employ the varnish formed with 
Demarara resin in the following way: The sheets intended for 
this purpose are laid flat on each other, and the varnish spread 
over the uppermost sheet with a'brush, until the paper appears 
perfectly colorless, without, however, the liquid thereon being 
visible. The first dieet is then removed, hung up for di^tjig, 
and tiie second treated in the same manner. After being dded

jug, and one pound of ivory-black well pulverized, half a pound 
of loaf sugar, half an ounce of oil of vitriol, and seven ounces of 
sweet oil, Incorporate the whole by stirring, 

2. Take twelve punces each of ivoty-black and molasses; sper- 
maceti oil, four ounces; and white wine vinegar, two quarts. 
Mix thoroughly. This contains no vitriol, and therefore will 
not iiqure the leather. The trouble of making it.is very little, 
and it would be well to prepare it for one's self, were it only to 
be assured that it is not injurious, 

Varnish for Iron Work. — ^To make a good black varnish for iron 
work, take eight pounds of asphaltum and fuse it in an iron 
kettle; then add five gallons of boiled linseed oil, one pound of 
litharge, half a pound ef sulphate of zinc (add these slowly, or it 
will fume over), and boil them for about three hours. Now add 
one and a half pounds of dark gum amber, and boil for two 
hours lor^r, or until the mass will become quite thick whep 
cool, after which it should be thinned with turpentine to du<^

oraiiunala,andtrappets and gthcn who um it will be But* of 

success. 

To Catch Foxes.— Take oil of amber, and b«aver'« ofl, «ach 
equal partis, aad mb them over the trap before setting it. Set in 
the usual way. 

To Catch Mink. — Take oil of amber, and beaver's oil, and rub 
over the trap. Bait with fish or birds. 

To Catch Muekrat. — In the female mnskrat near the vagina is a 
small bag which hel'ds from 30 to 40 drops, Now all the trap-, 
per has to do, is to procure a few female m\ skrats and squeeze 
the centeats of a bag into a vial. Now, when in quest of musk- 
rats, sprmkle a few drops of liquid on the bushes over and around 
the trap. This will attract the male muskrats in large numbers, 
and if the traps are properly arranged, large numbers of them 
may be taken. 

*«*Iu trapping Muskrats, ste&. traps should be used, and they 
should be set in the paths and runs of the animals, where they 
'ome upen the banks, and in every case the trap should be set 
wider the watar, and carefully concealed; and care should be 
taken that it has sufficient length of chain to enable the animalis 
to reach the water after being caught, otherwise they are liable 
to escape by tearing or knawing of their legs. 

To Catch Beaver. — In trapping for beaver, set the trap at the 
edge of the water or dam, Kt the psiut where the animals, pass 
from deep to shoal water, and always beneath the snrface, and 
fasten it by means of a stout chain to a picket driven in the 
batik, or to a bush or tree. A flat stick should be made fast to 
the trap by a cord a few feet long, which, if the animal ctanced 
to carry away, the trap would float on the water and poitit oak 
its position. The trap should then be baited with the following 
preparation, called 

" T7te Beaver Medicine. " 

This is prepared-from a substance called castor, and is obtained 
from the glandulous pouches of the male animal. 

The contents of five or six of these castor bags arc mixed with 
a nutmeg, twelve or fifteen cloves and thirty grains of cinnamon 
in fine powderj and the whole thing well stirred together with ^' 
much whiskey as will give it the consistency of mixed mustor/-. 
^bV Reparation must be Mt closely corked up, and in fo«r qr 



46 BOOK OF KNOWLIDGK. 

five days the odor becomes wonderful; and this medicine smeared 
upon the bits of wood etc., with which the traps are baited, will 
attract the beaver from a great distance, and wishing to make a 
close inspection, the animal puts its legs into the trap and is 
caught. 

\*The same caution in regard to length of chain should be 
observed for Beaver, as forOtters, Muskrats, etc., for unless they 
can reach the water they are liable to get out of the trap and 
escape. 

ChinesB Art of Catching Fish, — ^Take Cocculus Indicus, pulverizw 
and mix with dough, then scatter it broadcast over the water, as 
you would sow seed. The fish will sieze it with great avidity, 
and will instantly become" so intoxicated that they will turn 
belly up on top of the water, by dozens, hundreds, or thousands, 
as the^case may be. All that yon now have to do, is to have a 
boat or other convenience to gather them up, and as you gather 
put them in a tub of clean water and presently they will be as 
lively and healthy as ever. 

This means of taking fish, and the manner of doing it, has, 
heretofore, been knoWn to but few. The value of such know- 
ledge admits of no question. This manner of taking fish does 
not injure the flesh in the least. 

Secret Art of Catching Fish. — Put the oil of rhodium on the bait, 
when fishing with the hook, and you will always succeed. 

To Catch Fish. — ^Take the juice of smallage or lovage, and mix 
with any kind of bait. As long as there remain any kiudo/ 
fish within many yards of your hook, you will find yourself busy 
pulling them out. 

To Catch Abundance of Eels, Fish, &c. — Get over the water after 
dark', with a light and a dead fish that has been smeared with 
the juice of stinking glawdin — ^the fish will gather round you in 
large qua^ntities, and can easily be scooped up. 



THE FINE ARTS AND SCIENCES.

Paria. Jerk it to drive out the air bubbles, and let \t stand one 
hour, when you have a fine impression. 

The Mew and Beautiful Art of Transferring on to Glct^s. — Colored 
or plain Engravings, Photographs,^ Lithographs, Water Colors, 
Oil Colors, Crayons, Steel Plates, Newspaper Cuts, Mezzotinto, 
Pencil, Writing, Show Cards, Labels, — or in fact anything. 

Directions. — Take glass that is perfectly clear — window glass 
will answer — clean it thoroughly ; then varnish it, taking care 
to have it perfectly smooth ; place it where it will be entirely 
from dust; let it stand over night; then take your engraving, lay 
it in clear water until it is wet through (say ten or fifteen min- 
utes) then lay it upon a newspaper, that the moisture may dry 
from the surface, and still keep the other side damp. Imme- 
diately varnish your glass the second time, then place your 
engraving on it, pressing it down firmly, so as to exclude every 
particle of air; next rub the paper from the back, until it is of 
-uniform thickness — so thin that you can see through it, then 
varnish it the third time, and let it dry. 

Materials used for the above Art. — ^Take two ounces balsam 
of fir, to one ounce of spirits of turpentine; apply with a camel's 
hairbrush. 

The Art of Potchiomoni. — ^Take plain glass jars or vases, in any 
shape, and clean them thoroughly ; then obtain two or three 
sheets of figures, flowers, or views, in imitation of Chinese, 
Egyptian, or Swiss painting. These goods, as well as the jars, 
can be obtained in any of the principal cities. Now, in what- 
ever style you determine to ornament your vase or I'arin, cut out 
the figures from your sheet, and secure them in different parts 
insideyonr jar, with the fig^ures looking outwards. The best 
material for making them adhere is, to boil a piece of parch- 
ment; this makes a good size. Having secured the prints, make 
a varnish of balsam of fir and turpentine, and apply all over in- 
side with a fine brush. When the first coat is dry, give another 
coat; now take any color you choose — black, blue," green, yel- 
low, white;. pink, brown or red — and grind the paint fine, with 
the best white varnish, and apply a coat of this paint over the 
whole inside; let it dry, and then repeat coat upon coat, until 
the color is xufficiently strong to show even and bright outside. 
Jan and vases may be decorated in endless variety by this

VeHT Mef/iod of Embalming. — Mix together five ponnds dry sul- 
phate of alumine, one quart of warm water, and one hundred 
grains of arseuious acid. Inject threeor four quarts of this mix- 
ture into aM the vessels of the human body. This applies as well 
to all animals, birds, fishes, &c.. This process supersedes the 
old and revolting mode, and has been introduced into the great 
anatomical schools of Paris. 

To Make Wax Flowers. — ^The following articles will be required 
to commence wax work: 2 pounds white wax, ^ pound hair 
wire, I bottle carmine, 1 ultramarine blue, i bottle chrome 
yellow, 2 bottles chrome green. No, i, 2 bottles chrome green. 
No. 2, I bottle rose pink, i bottle royal purple, I bottle scarlet 
powder, i bottle balsam fir, 2 dozen sheets white wax. This will 
do to begin with. Now have a clean tin dish and pour therein 
a quart or two of water; then put in about i pound of the white 
wax and let it boil; when coel enough, so the bubbles will not 
form on top, it is ready to sheet, whkth is done as follows: — Take 
half of a window pane, 7x9, and, after having washed it clean, 
dip i^to a dish containing weak soap-suds; then dip into the 
wax and draw out steadily and plunge it into the suds. When the 
sheet will readily come off. Lay it on a cloth or clean paper to 
dry. Proceed in like manner until you have enough of the 
white; then add enough of the green powder to make a bright 
color, and heat and stir thoroughljr until the color is evenly 
distributed; then proceed as for sheeiteig white wax, The other 
colors are rubbed into the leaves aft«r they are cut out, rubbing 
light or heavy according to shade. 

For patterns you can use any natural leaf, forming the creases 
in wax with the thumb nail or a needle; to put |the flowers to- 
gether or the leaves onto the stem, hold in the hand until warm 
enough to ^tick. If the sheeted wax is to be used in summer, 
put in a little balsam of fir to make it hard. If for winter, none 
will be required. 

You can make many flowers without a teacher; but one to as- 
sist in the commencement, would be a great help; though the 
most particular thing about it is to get the wax sheeted. The 
materials I have suggested can be procured at any drug store, 
and will cost from jt3 to 14.5a

FARMERS' DEPARTMENT. 

Hot/f to get New Yarifies of Potatoes. — When the vines are done 
growing and are turned brown; the seed is ripe; then take the 
balls and string with a large needle and strong thread; hang 
them in a dry place, where they will gradually dry and mature, 
without danger or injury from frost. In the month of April, 
soak the ball for several hours from &e pulp, when washed and 
dried, they are fit for sowing in rows, in a bed well prepared in 
the garden; they will sprout in a fortnight; they must be attended 
to like other vegetables. When about twO inches high, they may 
be thinned and transplanted into rows. As they increase in 
size, they should be hilled. In the autumn many of them will 
be the size of a walnut, and frem that to a pea. In the following 
spring they should be planted in hills, placing the large ones to^ 
gether, — they will in the second' season attain their full size, and 
will exhibit several varieties of form, and may then be selected 
to suit the judgment of the cultivater. I would prefer gathering 
the balls from potatoes of a good kind. The first crop from 
seeds thus obtained, will be productive, and will continue sofot- 
many years, gradually deteriorating, until they will need a re- 
newal by the process. 

To Destroy Rats. — Pill any deep smooth vessel of considerable 
capacity to within six inches of the top with water, cover the 
surface with bran, and set the vessel in a place most frequented 
by these pests. In attempting to get at the bran they willlfal] 
in and be drowned. Seveisl dozen have been taken by this 
simple method at a time. 

To Kill Raisin Barn and Riek.-^Ms\i hogs lard in a bottle plunged 
in water of temperature of 150° Fahrenheit; introduced into it 
half an ounce of ph«splj«rus for every pound of lard; then add a 
pint of proof spirits or wlii^ey; cork the bottle firmly after its 
contents have been to 150°, taking it out of the water and agitat- 
ing till the phosphorus becomes uniformly difflised, making a 
milky looking fluid. The spiritmay be poured offon the liquor 
cooling; and you then have a fatty compound, which after being 
warmed geatiy, may be iaoarporated with a miatttuwof wh«at

Diuretic Balls. — Castile soap scraped fine, powdered resin, each 
three teaspoonfuls; powdered nitre, four teaspoonfuls; oil «f 
juniper, one small teaspoonful; honey, a sufficient quantity to

To Prevent Horses from Being Teased by Flies. — Boil three hand- 
fuls of walnut leaves in three quarts of water; sponge the horse 
(before going out of the stable) between and upon the ears, neck 
and flank. 

To Prevent Botts. — Mix a little wood-ashes with their drink

soap, one quarter of an ounce. Mix with molasses to make a 
ball. 



CONFECTIONERS' DEPARTMENT. 

Ginger Candy. — Boil a pound of clarified sugar until, upon 
taking out a drop of it on a piece of stick, it will become brittle 
when cold. Mix and stir up with it, for a common article, about 
a t^spoonfiil of ground ginger; if for a superior article, instead 
ofthe ground ginger add half the white of an egg, beaten up 
previously with fine sifted loaf sugar, and twenty drops of 
strong essence of ginger. 

Another. — ^Take coarsely powdered ginger, two ounces; boiling 
water one and a quarter pints; macerate in a warm place for two 
hours, strain, and add seven pounds each of loaf and brown 
sugar. 

Ginger Drops. — ^Are the same, except that they are made with 
all loaf sugar. 

Ginger Lozenges. — ^Dissolve in one quarter of a pint of hot 
water half an ounce of gum arable; when cold, stir it up with one 
and a half pounds of loaf sugar, and a spoonful of powdered 
ginger, or twelve drops- of essence of ginger. Roll and beat the 
whole up into a paste; make it into a flat cake, and punch out 
fh« loMuges with a ronnd stamp; dry them near the fire or in aa

Peppermint Lozenges. — Best powdered white sugar, seven lbs. ; 
pure starch, «ne lb.; oil of peppermint to flavor. Mix with 
mucilage. 

Peppermint, Rose or Hearhound Candy. — ^They may be made as 
lemon candy. Flavor with essence of rose, or peppermint or 
finely powdered hoarhound. Pour it out in a buttered paper, 
placed in a square tin pan. 

to Clarify Sugar for Candies. — ^To every pound of sugar, put a 
large cup of water, and put it in a brass or copper kettle, over a 
slow fire, for half an hour; pour into it a small quantity of isin- 
glass and gum arable, dissolved together. This will cause all 
impurities to rise to the surface; skim it as it rises. Flavor ac- 
cording to taste. V 

All kinds of sugar for candy, are boiled as above directed. 
When boiling loaf sugar, add a tablespoonful of rum onrinegar, 
to prevent its becoming too brittle whilst making.. 

Loaf sugar when boiled, by pulling and making into small 
rolls, and twisting a little, will make what is called little rock, 
or snow. By pulling loaf sugar after it is boiled, you can make 
it as white as snow. 

Common Twist Candy, — Boil three pounds of common sugar 
and one pint of water over a slow lire for half an hour, without 
skimming. When boiled enough take it off; rub the hands over 
with butter, take that which is a little ceoled, and pull it as you 
would molasses candy, until it is white; then twist or braid it, 
and cut it up in strips. 

Fine Peppermint Lozenges. — Best powdered white sugar, seven 
pounds; pure starch, one poiuid ; oil of peppermint to flavor. 
Mix with mucilage. 

Everton Toffee. — To make this favorite and whoTesome candy, 
take I Ji pounds of-moist sugar, 3 ounces of butter, a teacup and 
a half '$f water and one lemon. Boil the sugar, butter, water, 
and half the rind of the lemon together, and when done — ^which 
wijl be knswn by dropping into cold water, when it should be 
qidte exjiQ^— l«t it staaS aside till the boiling has ceased, and

Inmp into a bowl of water, and put tte sugar into your preserving 
kettle. Boil it down and skiai it until perfectly clear, and in a 
candying state. When sufficiently boiled, have ready the fruits 
you wish to preserve. Large white grapes, oranges separated 
into small pieces, or preserved fruits, taken out of their syrup 
and dried, are very nice. Dip the fruits into the prepared sugar 
while it is hot; put them in a cold place; they will soon become 
hard. 

Popped Corn. — Dipped in boiling molasses and studc together 
forms an excellent candy. 

Liquorice Lozenges. — Extract of liquorice, i pound, powdered 
white sugar, 2 pounds. Mix with mucilage made with rose- 
water. 

Fig Candy. — Take i pound of sugar and i pint of water, set 

over a slew fire. When done, add a few dreps of vinegar and a 

.Inmp of butter, and pour into pans in which split figs are laid. 

Raisin Candy. — Can be made in the same manner, substituting 
stoned raisias for the figs. Common molasses candy is very 
nice with all kinds of nuts added. 

Scotcl) Butter Candy. — ^Take i poimd of sugar, i pint of water; 
dissolve and boil. When done add i taUespeooful of butter, 
and enough Icnen juice and oil of lemon to flavor. 

Mng for Cakm. — Beat the whites of two small eggs to a hign 
froth; then add to th«m a quarter of a pound of white, g^und 
or powdered sugar; beat it well until it will lie in a heap; flavor 
witi leuen er rose. This wtU frost the top of a common-sized 
cake. Heap what you suppose to be sufficient in the centre of 
of the cake, then dip a broad-bladed knife in cold water, and 
spread the ice evenly over the whole surface. 

Saffron Lozenges. — Finely powdered hay-safiron, one ounce; 
finely powdered sugar, one pound; finely powdered starch, eight 
ounces. Mucilage to mix. 

Chocetate Cri«/Fi.— Chocolate, scraped fine, yi ounce, thick 
cream, 1 pint; sugar, (best,) 3 ounees; heat it nearly to boiling, 
then remove it freai the fire, and mill it well. When cold add 
the whites ef four or five eggs; whisk rapidly and take up the

Candied Lemon or Peppermint for Colds. — Boil 1% pounds sugar 
in a half pint of water, till it begins to candy round the sides; 
put in eight drops of essence; pour it upon buttered paper, and 
cut it with a knife. 



FOR THE HOUSEHOLD AND EVERY 
DAY REQUIREMENTS. 

Alum in Starch. — For starching muslins, ginghams, and cal- 
icoes, dissolve a piece of alum the size of a shellbark, for every 
pint of starch, and add to it. By so doing, the colors will keep 
bright for a long time, which is very desirable when dresses must 
be often washed, and the cost is but a trifle. 

Cider Veast. — ^Take cider from sour apples, before it ferments, 
scald, skim thoroughly, and pour, while hot, upon flour enough 
to make a stiff' batter. When cool, add yeast of any kind, and 
let it rise, stirring it down as often as it tries to run over for 
several days, then put it in a cool place (where it will not freeze), 
and you will have something equal to the best hop yeast. It 
will keep until May without any further labor. 

To Destroy Cockroaches. — The following is said to be effectual. 
These vermin are easily destroyed, simply by cutting up green 
cucumbers at night, and placing them abbut where roaches com- 
mit depredations. What is cut ftom the cucumbers in preparing 
them for the table answers the purpose as well, and three ap- 
plications will destroy all the roaches in the house. • Remove 
the peelings in the morning, and renew them at night. 

Fire Kindlers. — ^Take a quart of tar and three pounds of resin, 
melt them, bring to a cooling temperature, mix with as much 
sawdust, with a little charcoal added, as can be worked in; 
spread out while hot upon a board, when cold break up into 
lumps of the size of a large hickory nut, and you have, at a small 
expense, kindling material enough for a household for ©ae year. 
They will easily ignite from a match and burn with a strong 
blaze, long enough to start any wood that is fit to biun. 

Remedy against Moths. — An ounce of gum camphor and one or 
the powdered shell of red pepper are macerated in eight ounces 
(rfatroiig alcohol for several days, then strained. VJUta ttiir

tincture the fiirs or cloth are sprinkled over, and rolled up in 
sheets. Instead of the pepper, bitter apple may be used. This 
remedy is used in Russia under the name of the Chinese tincture 
of moths. 

Substitute for /east. — Boil one pound of flour, one quarter 
pound of brown sugar and a little salt in two gallons of water 
for one hour. When milk-warm, bottle and cork close, and it 
will be ready for use in twenty-four hours. 

7b Make Lye. — Have a large tub or cask and bore a hole on 
one side for a tap, near the bottom; place several bricks near the 
hole and cover them with straw. Fill the barrel with strong 
wood ashes. Oak ashes are strongest, and those of apple tree 
wood make the whitest soap. Pour on boiling water until it 
begins to run, then put in the tap and let it soak. If the ashes 
settle down as they are wet, fill it until full. 

Tomato Wine. — ^Take ripe fresh tomatoes, mash very fine, 
strain through a fine sieve, sweeten with good sugar, to suit the 
taste, set it away in an earthen or glass vessel, nearly full, cover 
tight, with exception of a small hole for the refuse to work off 
through during its fermentation. When it is done fermenting 
it will become pure and clear. Then bottle, and cork tight. A 
little salt improves ite flavor; age improves it. 

To Color Brown on Cotton or Woolen. — For ten pounds of cloth 
boil three pounds of catechu in as much water as needed to, 
cover the goods. When dissolved, add four ounces of blue 
vitriol; stir it well; put in the cloth and let it remain all night; 
in the morning drain it thoroughly; put four ounces of bi-chio- 
mate of potash in boiling water sufficient to cover your goods; 
let it remain fifteen minutes; wash in cold water; color in iron. 

To Cleanse and Brighten Faded Brussels Carpet— Boil some bran 
in water and with this wash the carpet with a flannel and brush, 
using Fuller's earth for the worst parts. When dry the carpet 
must be well beaten to get out the fuller's earth, then washed 
over with a weak solution of alum to brighten the colors. Some 
housekeepers cleanse and brighten carpets by sprinkling them 
first with fine salt and then sweeping them thoroughly. 

To give Stoves a fim Brilliant Appearance.— A teaspoonful of 
imlverized alum mixe«l with stove polish will give th« stove •

Method of Keepiim Hams in Summer. — Make bags of tmbleached 
muslin; place in &e bottom a little good sweet hay; put in fhe 
hani, and then press around and over it firmly more hay; tie the 
bag and hang up in a dry place. Ham secured im this yiay wjtl 

keep for years. 

Honf to Cause Vegetabhs and Fruits to Grow to an Enormous Size 
and also to Increase the brilliancy and Fragrancy of Flowers. — ^ 
curious discovery has recently been made public in France, in 
regard to the culture of vegetable and fruit trees. By watering 
with a solution of sulphate of iron, the most wonderful fecundity 
has been attained. Pear-trees and beans, which have been sub' 
mitted to tbis treatment, have nearly doubled in the size of their 
productions, and a noticeable improvement has been remarked 
in their flavor. Dr. Becourt reports that while at the head of 
an establishment at Enghien, or the sulphurous springs, he had 
the gardens and plantations connected with it watered, during 
several weeks of the early spring, with sulphurous water, and 
not only the plantations prospered to a remarkable extent, but 
flowers acquired a peculiar brilliancy of coloring and healthy 
aspect which attracted universal attention. 

Drying Corn. — With a sharp knife shave the com from the ear. 
thea scrape the cob, leaving one-half the hull clinging to the cob. 
Place a tin or earthen vessel two-thirds full of this "milk of corn" 
over a kettle of boiling water, stir frequently until dry enough to 
spread upon a firm cloth without sticking, when the wind and sun 
(away from dust and flies) will soon complete the process. To 
prepare for the table, put iu cold water, set it where it will be- 
come hot, but not boil, for two hours; then season with salt and 
pepper, boil for ten minutes ; add of butter and white sugar a 
tablespoonful of each just before ready to serve. 

To Destroy Lice on Chickens. — The following will kill lice on 
the first apphcation : Put six cents worth of cracked Coculus In- 
dicus berries into a bottle that will hold a half pint of alcohol', 
fill the bottle with alcohol, and let it stand twenty-four hours. 
When the hen comes off with the young chickens, take the mix< 
tnre, and with a small cotton rag^ wet the head of each chicken 
enough to have it reach through the little feathers to the skin; 
also with the Same rag, wet the hen under her wings. Be care-

Cracked Wheat—Tor a pint of the crack«i gnin, havs two 
quarts of water boiHag in a smooth iron pet over a qdick fire; 
Btir in the wheat sl«wly; boil fast and stir caaitant^ f«r the 
first half hour cooking, or until it begins to thicken and "pop 
up;" then lift from the quick fire, and place the p«t where the 
wheat will cook slowly for an hour longer. Ke^ it covered 
closely, stir now and then, and be careful not to let it bum at 
the bottom. Wheat cooked thus is much sweeter and richer 
than when left to soak and simmer for hours, as many think 
necessary. White wheat cooks the easiest When ready to 
dish out, have your moulds moistered with cold water, cover 
lightly, and set in a cool place. Eat warm or cold with milk 
and sugar. 

Honf to hare Green Pea Seup in Winter. — Sow peas thickly in 
pots and boxes, say six weeks before the soup is wanted. Place 
them in a tesoperature of 60° or so, close to the glass in a house 
or pit. O''*' the plants a.' 9oon as they attain a ke^^t of from 
three to six inches, and r-r them through a sieve. The shoots 
alone will make a fair s. '-p. Mixed with dry peas, also 
passed through a sieve, no one could scarcely distinguish color 
or flavor from that of real green pea soup. There is, however, 
considerable difference in the flavor of pea leaves, as well as of 
the peas themselves. The best marrows, .such as Ne PlusUltra 
and Veitche's Perfection, yield the most piquant cuttings. Also 
the more light the plants receive the higher the flayer, plants 
drawn up or at all blanched, being by no means comparable 
with those well and strongly grown. 

In the spring, a few patches or rows may be sown in open 
quarters expressly for green cuttings. These are most perfect 
and full flavored when four inches high. When too long the 
flavor seems to have run to wood, and the peculiar aroma of 
green peas is weaker. 

There is yet another mode of making green pea soup at any 
season at very short notice. Chip the peas by steeping them in 
water and leaving them in a warm place for a few days. Then 
slightly boil or stew, chips and all, and pass tiiem through a 
sieve. The flavor is full and good, though such pea soup lacks 
eolor. Itis astonishing how much the mere vegetation of seads

a fact that might often be turned to useful account in the kitchen 
in flavoring of soups or dishes, with turnips, celery, parsley, &c. 

Composition for Restoring Scorcfied Linen. — Boil, to a good con- 
sistency, in half a pint of vinegar, two ounces of Puller's earth, 
an ounce of hen's dung, half an ounce of ca,ke soap, and the 
juice of two onions. Spread this composition over th6 whole of 
the damaged part; and if the scorching is not quite through, 
and the threads actually consumed, after suffering it to dry on, 
and letting it receive a subsequent good washing or two, the 
place will appear full ^ white and perfect as any other part of 
the linen. '^ 

To Bemove Indelible Inle Stains. — Soak the stained spot in strong 
salt water, then wash it with ammonia.' Salt changes the 
nitrate of silver into chloride of silver, and ammonia dissolves 
the chloride. 

To Cook Cauliflower. — Choose those that are close and white 
and of middle size, trim off the outside leaves, cut the stalk off" 
flat at the bottom, let them lie in salt and water an hout before 
you boil them. Put them into boiling water with a handful of 
salt in it, skim it well and let it boil slowly till done. Fifteen 
minutes will suffice for a small one, and twenty will be long 
enough for a large one. If it is txnled a minute or two after it 
is done the flavor will be impaired. 

To Pickle String Beans.— Piaee them in a pan with alternate 
layers of salt and leave them thns for twenty-four hours. Drain 
them and place them in a jar with allspice,- cloves, pepper,^ and 
a little salt. Boil enough vin^pr to cover them, pour over 
them and let them stand till the next day, boil the vinegar the 
second time, and pour it on again. The next day boil the 
vinegar for the last time, pour it over the beans, and when quite 
cold, cover the jar tightly and set in a cool closet. 

Chili Sauce.— twelve ripe' tomatoes, four ripe peppers, two 
onions, two tablespoofuls of salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
three tea-cups of vinegar, a little cinnamon; peel the tomatoes 
and chop them fine, also the peppers and onions, and boil all 
together one hour.

or mix with it a small quantity of magnesia. Abjure soothing 
syrups, and for colic give catnip or smellage tea. Give the baby 
a tepid bath at night as well as in the morning rubbing him 
well with the hand. After the bath, let him feed and then sleep, 
We find open air the best tonics for babies. Ours takes his naps 
out of doors in the shade during the warm weather, and his 
cheeks are two roses. 

To Can Gooseberries without Breaking them. — Fill the cans with 
berries, and partly cover with water, set the jars into a vessel of 
water, and raise the temperature to the boiling point. Boil eight 
minutes, remove from the kettle, cov^r with boiling water, and 
seal immediately. If sugar is used, let it be pure white, and al- 
low eight ounces to a quart of berries. Make into a syrup, and 
use in the cans instead of water. The glass cans with glass tops, 
a rubber and a screw ring, we have found the simplest and most 
perfect of the many kinds oflFered for sale in the market. 

Ready Mode of Mending Cracks in Stoves, Pipes, and Iron Ovens. 
— When a crack is discovered in a stove, through which the fire 
or smoke penetrates, the aperture may be completely closed in 
a moment with a composition consisting of wood ashes and com- 
mon salt, made up into paste with a little water, and plastered 
over the crack. The good eflFect is equally certain, whether the 
stove, etc., be cold or hot. 

Preservation of Milk and Cream. — Put the milk into bottles, 
then place them in a saucepan with cold water, and gradually 
raise it to the boiling point; take it from the fire, |and instantly 
cork the bottles, then raise the milk once more to the boiling 
point for half a minute. Finally let the bottles cool in the watei 
in which they were boiled. Milk thus treated will remain per- 
fectly good for six mouths. Emigrants, especially those having 
children will find the above hint add much to their comforl 
while on their voyage. 

To Keep Milk from Turning Sour. — Add a little sub-carbonate of 
soda, or of potash. This by combining with, and neutralizing 
the acetic acid formed, has the desired effect, and keeps the 
milk from turning sooner than it otherwise would. The addi- 
tion is perfectly harmless, and does not injure the taste. 

Strawberry Vinegar. — Put four pounds of very ripe strawberries, 
niodjr dreiced, into three quarts of the best vinegar, and let tlwm 



6o BOOK OF KNOWLSDGB. 

stand three or four days; then drain the vinegar thraugk a j«Uj- 
bag, and pour it on the same quantity of fruit. Repeat tiie process 
in the days for a third time. Finally, te each pound of the 
liquor thus ohtained, add one pound of fine sugar. Xottic, and 
let it stand covered, but not tightly corked, one week;,tteii cork 
it tight, and set it in a cool, dry place, where it will not freeze. 
Raspberry vinegar is made the same way. 

C/Ver Vinagar. — After cider has become too sour for use, set it 
in a warm place, put to it occasionally the rinsings of the sugar 
basis or molasses jug, and any remains of ale or oeld tea; let it 
remain with the bung open, and you will toon have the host of 
vinegar. 

To §ive Lustre to Silver. — Dissolve a quantity of alum in water, 
so as to make a pretty strong Inine, and skim it earaMljr; then 
add seme soap to it, and dip a linen rag in it, and mk over tba 
silver. 

To make Wator-Proof Ptroas Cloth. — Cloee water-proof elotb 
fabrics, suck as glazed oil-clotk, Indian-rubber, andgsttaycrdie 
cloth are completely water -proof, put do not permit porspiratioei 
and the exkalted gases from the skin to pass throu|^ them, fa^ 
cause they are air-tight as well as water-tight. Persons wfe.- 
wear air-tight garments soon become faint, if they are undpf 
going severe exercise, such as that to which soldiers are exposT ': 
when en march. A porous, water-proof cloth, th^efore, is tl '. 
best for outer garments during wet weather, for those whose d 
ties or labor causes them to prespire freely. The best way i :, 
preparing such cloth is by the following process: Take 2% H '■ 
of alum and dissolve this in 10 gallons of boiling water; tken.i i 
a separate vessel dissolve the same quantity of sugar of lead L-'i 
10 gallons of water, and mix the two selotiene. The clotii ; 
now wdl handled in this liquid, until every part of it is pe 
etrated; then it is squeozed and dried in the air, or in a wal 'i 
apartment, then washed in cold water and dried again, when ; 
is fit for use. If neeeasary, the cloth may be dijped in tl. .3 
liquid and dried twice before being washed. The liquor appea i 
curdled, when the alum and lead solutions are mixed togeACi 
This is the result of double decomposition, the sulphate of lea'^ 
which is an insoluble salt, being formed. The sulphate of lead f j-

or moisture, and yet it does not render Ihe cloth air-tight. Such 
cloth is also partially non-inflammable. A solution of alum it- 
self will render cloth, prepared as described, partially water- 
proof, but it is not so good as the sulphate of lead. Such cloth 
— cotttn or woolen— sheds rain like the feathers on the back of 
adu<&. 

To Cleanse Carpet. — i teaspoonful liquid ammonia. in i gallon 
warm water, will often restore the color of carpets, even if pro- 
duced by acid or alkali. If a ceiling has been whitewashed with 
carpet down, and a few drops are visible, this will remove it. 
Or, after the carpet is well beaten and brushed, scour it with ox- 
gall, which will not only extract grease but freshen the colors — 
I pint of gall in three gallons of warm water, will do a large 
carpet. Table flo<*-cloths may be thus washed. The suds left 
from a wash where ammonia is used, even if almost cold, cleanses 
these floor-cloths well. 

To keep Hams. — After the meat has been well cured by pickle 
and smoke, take some clean ashes from bits of coal; moisten 
them with a little water so that they will form a paste, or else 
jnst wet the hams a little, and rub on the dry ashes. Rubbed 
m thoroughly they serve as a capital insect protector, and the 
hams can be hung up in the smoke-house or wood-chamber 
without any danger of molestation. 

A Cold Cement for Mending Earthenware, says a recent English 
work, reckoned a great secret among workmen, fe made by 
grating i pound of old cheese, with a bread grater, into a quart 
of milk, in which it must be left for a period of fourteen hours. 
It should be stirred quite often. A pound of unslaked lime, 
finely pulverized in a mortar, is then added, and the whole is 
thoroughly mixed by beating. This done, the whites of twenty- 
five eggs are incorporated with the rest, and the whole is ready 
for use. There is another cement for the same purpose which 
is used hot. It is made of resin, beeswax, brick dust, and chalk 
boiled together. The substances to be cemented must be heated, 
and when the surfaces are coated with cement, they must b« 
mbbed hard upon each other, as in making a glue joint with 
■wood.

slit there will be a new cucumber as large as the first" 

White Cement— Take white (fish) glue, i lb. xo oz., dry white 
lead 6 oz. ; soft water 3 pints; alcohol i pint 

Dissolve the glue by putting it in a tin kettle or dish, 4ou- 
taining the water, and set this dish in a kettle of water, to pre- 
vent the glue from being burned; when the glue is- all dissolved, 
put in the lead and stir and boil until it is thoroughly mixed; 
remove from the fire, and when cool enough to bottle, add the 
alcohol, and bottle while it is yet warm, keeping it corked. This 
last recipe has been sold about the country for from twenty-five 
cents to five dollars, and one man gave a horse for it. 

To Clean Furniture. — An old cabinet maker says the best 
preparation for cleaning picture frames and restoring furniture 
especially that somewhat marred or scratched, is a mixture oj 
three parts linseed oil and one part spirits ot turpentine. It 
not only covers l!he disfigured surface, but restores wood to its 
natural color, and leaves a lustre upon its surface. Put on with 
a woolen cloth, and when dry, rub with woolen. 

Bruises on Furniture. — ^Wet the part in warm water; double u 
piece of brown paper five or six times, soak in the warm water, 
and lay it on the place, apply on that a warm, but not hot, flat- 
iron till the moisture is evaporated. If the bruise benotgonef 
repeat the process. After two or three applications the dent wiU 
be raised to the surface. If the bruise be small, merely soak i» 
with warm water, and hold a red-hot iron near the surface keep- 
ing the surface continually wet— the bruise will soon disappear. 

To Prevent Iron Bust. — ^Kerosene applied to stoves or farming 
implemeats, during summer, will prevent their rusting. 

To Color Sheop Skins. — Unslaked limeand litharge equal parts, 
mixed to a thin paste with water, 'will color buff— several coats 
will make it a dark brown; by adding a little ammonia and 
nitrate of silver a fine black is produced. Terra japoaica will 
impact «t "iaa color" to wool, and the red shade is deepened by 
spoagivg with a solution of lime and water, using a strong selu- 
tiaa ejidum water to "set" the colors; i part erystelized nlteate

Remi. -iy for Burns. — Take one teacup of lard and the whites of 
two eggs, work together as much as it can be, then spread on 
doths and apply. Change as often as necessary. 

How Sun mer Suits should be Washed. — Summer suits are nearly 
allmar'.Lof white or buff linen, pique, cambric, or muslin, and 
Ih'- art of preserving the new appearance after washing is a 
matter of the greatest iinportance. Common washwomen spoil 
everything with soda, and nothing is more frequent than to see 
the delicate tints of lawns and percales turned into dark blotches 
and muddy streaks by the ignorarce and vandalism of a laun- 
dress. It is worth while for ladies to pay attention to this, anc' 
insist upon having their summer dresses washed according tc. 
the directions which they should be prepared to give their laun. 
dresses themselves. In the first place, the water should be tepid, 
the soap should not be allowed to touch the fabric; it should be 
washed and rinsed quick, turned upon the wrong side, and hung 
in the shade to dry, and when starchr^d (in thin boiled but not 
boiling starch) should be folded in sheets or towels, and ironed 
upon the wrong side as soon as possible. But linen should be 
washed in water in which hay or a quart bag of bran has been 
boiled. This last will be found to answsr for starch as well, and 
is- excellent for pink dresses of all kinds, but a handful of salt i« 
very useful also to set the colors of light cambrics and dotte4 
lawns; and a little ox gall will not only set but brighten yellow 
and purple tints, and has a good affect upon green. 

How to Fasten Rubber to Wood and Metal. — As rubber plates and 
rings are now-a-days used almost exclusively for making con> 
nections between steam and other pipes and apparatus, xaxtA 
annoyance is often experienced by the impossibility or imper- 
fection of an air-tight connection. This is obviated entirely by 
employing a cement which fastens alike well to the rubber and 
to the metal or wood. Such cement is prepared by a solution 
of shellac in ammonia. This is bestmade by soaking pulveriatd 
gum shellac in ten times its weight of strong ammonia, when a 
slimy mass is obtained, which in three or four weeks will become 
liqtlid without the use of hot water. This soft^ans the rubber, 
and becomes, after volatilization of the ammonia, har^ aad ia>- 
panBWtbto to gases and flnida.

Renewing Maroon Colors on Woof. — ^Wash the goods in vety 
weak lye; then jinse thoroughly In clear water; thus you have * 
beautiful, even color, although your goods have been mucli 
faded and stained. Though the color thus obtained may not bi 
the exact shade as when new, it is, however, a very pretty one. 
The above will not answer for other than all woolen goods of fc 
maroon color. 

To make Water-Proof Cloth out of thick Ducking.— 'tne following 
French recipe is given: Take two pounds four ounces of alum, 
and dissolve it in ten gallons of water. In like manner dissolve 
the same quantity of sugar of lead in a similar quantity'Cf water, 
and mix the two together. They form a precipitate of the sul- 
phate of lead. The clear liquor is now withdrawn, and the clotk 
immersed one hour in tlie solution, when it is taken out ami 
dried in the shade, washed in clean water and dried again. 

Cochineal Coloring. — The following is a good recipe:— Cochineal, 
alum, cream tartar carb. potassa, each three drachms; watet , 
eight ounces; sugar six ounces. Rub the cochineal, alum and 
cream tartar, with eight ounces boiling water, and, when cold, 
gradually add carb. potassa, and strain; pour water on tho 
strainer sufficient to measure eight fluid ounces, then add tht) 
sugar. -' 

How to Stop a Pinhole in Lead Pipe.— Take a ten-penny naft 
place the square end upon the hole, and hit it two or three slight 
blows with s hammer, and the orifice is closed as tight as though 
you had employed a plumber to do it at a cost of a dollar or 
more. 

To Build a Chimney that Will Mot Smoke. — ^The Scientific AmeH' 
can gives the following hints to those who would "build a 
chimney that would not smoke:" — ^The chief point is to make 
the throat not less than four inches broad and 12 long; then the 
chimney should be abruptly enlarged to double the size, and so 
continue for one foot or more; then it may be gradually tapered 
oflF as desired. But the inside of the chimney throughout its 
whole length to the top, should be plastered very smooth with 
good mortar, which will harden with age. The area of a chimney 
should be at least half a square foot, and no flues less than sixty 
square inches. The best shape for a chimney is circular, or

To Prevent Turners' Wood Spfifti'ng. — Small pieces of valuable 
wood, such kinds as are used for turning, etc., are very liable to 
split readily — that is, outward from the centre. To prevent tiiis, 
soak the pieces, when first cut, in cold water for twenty-four 
hours, then boil in hot water for two or three hours, and after- 
ward dry slowly, and under cover. This will be found useful in 
making handsome mantle, toilet, and other articles from sumac, 
cherry, and other woods that never grow very large. 

To remove Dry Paint on Windows. — ^The most economical way 
to remove dry paint from the panes is to make a small swab hav- 
ing a handle some eight inches long, dip it in a little diluted 
oxalic acid, and rub off the paint with a swab. 

Everlasting Fence Posts. — I discovered many years ago that 
wood could be made to last longer than iron in the ground but 
thought the process so simple and inexpensive that it was not 
worth while making any stir about it I would as soon have 
poplar, basswood, or quaking ash as any other kind of timber 
for fence posts. I have taken out basswood posts after having 
been set seven years, which were as sound when taken out as 
when they were first put in the ground. Time and weather 
seemed to have no effect on them. The posts can be prepared 
for less than two cents a piece. This is the recipe: Take boiled 
linseed oil and stir it in pulverized charcoal to the consistency 
of paint. Put a coat of this over the timber, and there is not a 
man who will live to see it rotten. 

How to Test tlie Ricliness of Af//*.— Procure any longi glass 
vessel — a cologne bottle or long phial. Take a narrow strip of 
paper, just the length from the neck to the bottom of the phial, 
and mark it off with one hundred lines at equal distances; or 
fifty lines, and count each as two, and paste it upon the phial, 
so as to. divide its length into a hundred equal parts. Fill it to 
the highest mark with milk fresh from the cow, and allow it to 
stand in a perpendicular position twenty-four hours. The num- 
ber of spaces occupied by the cream will give you its exact pre- 
centage in the milk without any guess work. 

J, Uend Tinware by t/ie lieat of a Candle.— Take a vial about two-

Then, with the cork of the vial, wet the place to be mendeO 
with the preparation; then put a piece of sheet zinc over ttae fao^e, 
and hold a lighted caudle or spirit-lamp under the place, whicL 
melts the solder on the tin, and causes the zinc to adhere with, 
out further trouble. Wet the zinc also with the eolutlon; or ti 
little solder may be put on instead of the zinc, or with tlie /inc. 

To Remove Slains. — ^The stains of ink on cloth, paper, or wood 
may be removed by almost all acids; but those acids arft to b» 
preferred which are least likely to injure the texture of the 
stained substance. The muriatic acid, diluted with five or siv 
times its weight of water, may be applied to the spot, and after 
a minute or two may be washed off, repeating the application a% 
often as may be necessary. But the vegetable acids are attended 
with less risk, and are equally effected. A solution ot the ox 
Hlic, citric (add of lemons), or tartareous acids in water may b» 
applied to the most Aelicate fabrics, witnout any danger o< 
injuring them; and the same solutions will discharge writing bul 
not printing ink. Hence they may be appked in cleaning books 
which have been defaced by writing on the margin, without 
imparing the text. Lemon-juice and th» juice of sorrels wilt 
also remove ink-stains, but not so easily m the concrete acid of 
lemons or citric acid, 

to Prevent Snow-water or Ham from htnetrating the Safes oi 
Shoes or Boots in Winter. — ^This simple and effectual remedy is 
nothing more than a little beeswax aad mutton suet, warmed 
in a pipkin until in a liquid state. Then rub some of it lightly 
over the edges of the sole where the sticnes are, which will re- 
pel the wet, and not in the least prevent the blacking from having 
the usual effect. 

An Easy Method of preventing Moths in Fart or Woolens. — Sptiukle 
the furs or woolen stuffs, as well as the drawers or boxes in 
which they are kept, with spirits of turpentine; the unpleasant 
scent of which will speedily evaporate ' on exposure of the stuffs 
to the air. Some people place sheets of paper, moistened with 
spirits of turpentine, over, under, or between pieces of cloth, etc., 
and find it a very effectual mode. 

To keep Moths, Beetles, etc., from Clothea. — Put a piece of cam-

To make Sea-wttHr ft for Washing Linen at Sea, — Soda put into 
sea-water tendons it turbid: the lime and magnesia fall to the 
bottom. To make sea-water fit for washing linen at sea, as much 
soda must be put in it, as not only to efiect a complete precipita- 
tion on these earths, but to render the sea-watei sufficiently 
laxivial or alkaline. Soda should always be taken to sea for 
this purpose. 

To Destroy Insects. — When bugs have obtained a lodgment in 
walls or timber, the surest mode of overcoming the nuisance is 
to putty up every hole is moderately large, and oiVpaint the 
whole wall or timber. In bed-furniture, a mixture of soft soap, 
with snuff or arsenic, is useful to fill up the holes where the 
bolts or fastenings are fixed, etc. French polish may be applied 
to smoother parts of the wood. 

Poultice for Burns and Frozen Flesh. Tndian-meal poultices, 
covered with j^oung hyson tea; moister d with hot water, and 
laid over bums or frozen parts, as hot as jan be borne, will re- 
lieve the pain in five minutes, and blisters, if they have not, 
will not arise. One poultice is usually sufficient. 

Cracked Hippies. — Glyceine and tannin, equal weights, rubbed 
together into an ointment, is highly recommended, as is also 
mutton tallow and glycerine. 

To take the Impression of any Butterfly lit all its Colors. — Having 
taken a butterfly, kill it without spoiling its wings, which con- 
trive to spread out as regularly as possible in a flying position. 
Then, with a small brush or pencil, take a piece of white paper; 
wash part of it with gum-water, a little thicker than ordinary, 
so that it may easily dry. Afterwards, laying yonr butterfly on 
the paper, cut off the body close to the wings, and, throwing it 
away, lay the paper on a smooth board with the fly upwards; 
and, laying another paper over that, put the while preparation 
into a screw-press, and screw down very hard, letting it remain 
under that pressure for half an hour. Afterwards take off the 
wings of the butterfly and you will find a perfect impression of 
them, with all their various colors, marked distinctly, remain- 
ing on the paper. When this is done draw between the wing* 
of your impression the hoJy of the- butterfly, and color it after 
the insect itself.

of spirits of wine, three ouncss of French chalk powdered, and 
five ounces of pipe-clay. Mix the above' ingredients, and make 
them up ia rolls about the length of a finger, and you will find 
a never-failing remedy for removing grease from woollen or 
silken goods. N. B. — It is applied by rubbing on the spot either 
dry or wet, and afterwards brushing the place. 

Easy and Safe Method of discharging Orease from Woollen Cloths. 
— Fuller's earth and tobacco pipe-clay, being put wet on an oil- 
spot, absofibs the oil as the water evaporates, and leaves the 
vegetable or animal fibres of the cloth clean on being beaten or 
brushed out. When the spot is occasioned by tallow or wax, it 
is necessary to heat the part cautiously by an iron or the fire 
while the cloth is drying. In some kind of goods, blotting-paper, 
bran, or raw starch, may be used mth advantage. 

To Take out Spots of Ink. — As soon as Uie accident happens, wet 
the place with juice of sorrel or lemen, or with vinegar, and the 
best hard white soap. 

To take Iron-moulds out of Linen, — Hold the iron-mould on the 
cover of a tankard of boiling water, and rub on the spot a little 
juice of sorrel and a little salt; and when the cloth has thoroughly 
imbibed the juice, wash it in lye. 

To take out Spots on Silk. — Rub the spots with spirits of turpen- 
tine, this spirit exhaling, carries off with it the oil that causes 
the spot 

To take Wax out of Vehet of all Colors except Crimson. — Take a 
crumby wheaten loaf, cut in two, toast it before the fire, and, 
while very hot, apply it to the part spotted with wax. Then 
appiy another piece of toasted bread hot as before, and continue 
this application until the wax is entirely taken out. 

To Bleach Straw. — Straw is bleached by the vapors of sulphur, 
or a solution of oxalic acid or chloride of lime. It may be dyed 
with any liquid color. 

Windows, io Crystallize. — Dissolve epsom-salts in hot ale, or 
solution of gum arable, wash it over the window, and let it dry. 
If you wish to remove any, to form a border or centre-piece, do 
it with a wet cloth.

WfiSfewash. — Slack half a bushel of lime with boiling water, 
and cover the vessel to retain the steam. Strain the liquor, and 
add one peck of salt previously dissolved in warm water, 3 lbs. 
of rice boiled and ground to a paste, Spanish whiting, 8oz. ; glue, 
t pound; mix and add hot water, 5 gallons; let it stand a few 
•lays, and apply hot It makes a brilliant wash for inside or 
outside works. 

To Purify Water for Drinking. — Filter river-water through a 
sponge, more or less compressed, instead of stone or sand, by 
which the water is not only rendered more clean, but whole- 
some; for sand is insensibly dissolved by the water, so that in 
tour or five years it will have lost a fifth part of its weight. 
Powder of charcoal should be added to the sponge when the 
■water is foul or fetid. Those who examine the large quantity 
of terrene matter on the inside of tea-kettels, will be convinced 
all water should be boiled before drinking, if they wish to avoid 
being affected with gravel or stone, etc. 

To Purify the Muddy Waters of /Hirers or Pits. — Make a number 
of holes in the bottom of a deep tub; lay some clean gravel there- 
on, and above this some clean sand; sink this tub in the river or 
pit, so that only a few inches of the tub will be above the surface 
of the water; the river or pit water will filter through the sand, 
and rise clear through it to the level of the water on the outside, 
and will be pure and limpid. 

Metliod of Making Putrid Water Sweet in a Night's Time.— Fout 
large spoonfuls of unslacked lime, put into a puncheon of ninety 
gallonsof putrid water at sea, will, in one night, make it as 
c'earand sweet as the best spring-water just drawn; but unless 
the water is afterwards ventilated sufficiently to carbonize the 
I'me, it will be lime-water. Three ounces of pure unslacked 
lime should saturate 90 gallons of water. 

Tree of Lead. — Dissolve an ounce of sugar of lead in a quart of 
clean watet, and put it into a glass decanter or globe. Then 
suspend in the solution, near the top, a small piece of zinc of an 
irregular shape. Let it stand undisturbed for a day, and it will 
begin to shoot out into leaves, and apparently to vegetate. If 
left undisturbed for a few days, it will become extremely beauli- 
M; but it must be moved with great caution. It may appear to 
I nnacquainted with chemistry, tl»t the plwe ef ifaM •»■ 



tnally pats out leaves; but this is a mistake, for, if the zinc b« 
esamined, it will lie tound nearly unaltered. This phenomenoii 
is owing to the zinc having a greater attraction for oxygen than 
the lead has; consequently, it takes it from the oxide of lead, 
which re-appears in its metallic state. 

Arbor Martis, or Tree of Mars. — Dissolve iron filings in acqua. 
fortis moderately concentrated, till the acid is saturated; then 
add to it gradually a solution of mixed alkali, commonly called 
oil of tartar per deliquium. A strong efiFervescence will ensue; 
and the iron, instead of falling to the bottom of the vessel, will 
nfterwards rise so as to cover the sides, forming a multitude of 
;>amifications heaped one upon the other, which will sometimes 
Dassover the edge of the vessel, and extend themselves on the 
)utside with all the appearance of a plant. 

To keep Apples from Freezing, — Apples form an article of chief 
'lecessity in almost every family: therefore, great care is taken 
*o keep them from frost; it being well known that they, if left 
Unprotected, are destroyed by the first frost which occurs. They 
may be kept in the attic with impunity throughout the winter, 
uy simply covering them over with a liaen cloth: be sure to 
liave linen, for woolen or other cloth is of no avail. 

To Preserve Grapes. — ^Take a cask or barrel which will hold 
water, and put into it, first a layer of bran, dried in an oven or 
of ashes well dried and sifted, upon this place a layer of grapes 
well cleaned, and gathered in the afternoon of a dry day, belore 
Vhey are perfectly ripe; proceed thus with alternate layer?, of 
bran or ashes and grapes, till the barrel is full, taking care that 
the grapes do not touch each other, and to let the last layer be 
of bran or ashes, then dope the barrel so that the air may not 
penetrate, which is an essential point Grapes thus packed 
will keep fbr nine or even twelve months. To restore them to 
freshness, cut the end of the stalk of each bunch of grapes, and 
put it into red wine, as you would flowers into water. White 
grapes should be put into white wine. 

To Increase the Laying of Eggs.— The best method is to mix 
with their food, every other day, about a teaspoon of ground 
cayenne pepper to each dozen fowl. Whilst upon this subject, 
it would be well to say, that if your hens lay soft eggs, or eggs 
without shells, you should put plenty of old plaster, egg-shelb,

fo Preserve Afeafe.— Beef to pickle for long keeping. First, 
lAoroughly rub salt into it, and let it remain in bulk for twenty- 
four hours to draw oflF the blood. Second, take it up, letting it 
drain, and pack as desired. Third, have ready a pickle prepared 
as follows: for every loo pounds of beef use 7 pounds salt; salt- 
petre and cayenne pepper each, i ounce; molasses, i quart; and 
soft water, 8 gallons; boil and skim well, and when cold pout 
over the beef. 

Another method is to use 5 pounds salt, i pound brown sugar, 
and X ounce saltpetre, to each 100 pounds; dissolve the above 
in sufScient water to cover the meat, and in two weeks drain all 
off, and make more same as firsts It will then keep through the 
season. To boil for eating, put into boihng water; for soups, 
into cold water. 

Flies, to Destroy. — Boil some quafisia-chips in a little water, 
sweeten with syrup or molasses, and plac it in saucers. It is 
destructive to flies, but not to children. 

Walnuts to Pickle. — ^Take 100 young walnats, lay them in salt 
«nd water for two or three days, changing the water every day. 
(If required to be soon ready for use, pierce each walnut with 3 
larding pin that the pickle may penetrate.) Wipe them with » 
soft cloth, and lay them on a folded cloth for some hours. Then 
put them in ajar, and pour on them sufficient of the above 
spiced vinegar, hot, to cover them. Or they may be allowed to 
simmer gently in strong vinegar, then put into a jar with a 
handful of mustard-seed, i ounce of ginger, jounce mace, i 
ounce allspice, 2 heads of garlic, and 2 split nutmegs; and pour 
on them sufficient boiling vinegar to cover them. Some prefer 
the walnuts to be gently simmered with the brine, then laid on 
a cloth for a day or two till they turn black, put into ajar, and 
hot spiced vinegar poured on them. 

To Pickle Cucumbers and Gherkins. — Small cucumbers, but not 
too young, are wiped clean with a dry cloth, put into ajar, and 
boiling vinegar, with a handful of salt, poured on them. Boil 
up the vinegar every three days, and pour it on them until they 
become green ; then add ginger and pepper, and tie them 
up close for use, or cover them with salt and water (as above) in 
a stone jar; cover them, and set them on the hearth before the

Mushroom Ketchup. — Pickled mushrooms, 4 pounds; [salt, 2 
pounds. Sprinkle it on the mushrooms; and, when they liquefy, 
remove the juice; add pimento, 6 ounces; cloves, i ounce; boil, 
gently and strain; the remaining liquor, if any, may be treated 
with pepper, mace, and ginger for a second quality. 

Tomato Ketchup. — Proceed as for mushroom ketchup, and add 
a little Chili pepper vinegar. 

Court-plaster. — Court-plaster is made by repeatedly brushing ^ 
over stretched sarcenet with a solution of I part of isinglass in 8 
of water mixed with 8 parts of proof spirit, and finishing with a 
coat of tincture of benzoin, or of balsam of Peru.

Godfrey's Cordial, — ^The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy! to 
prevent the mischief arising from the different strengths of this 
compound, directs it to be prepared as follows: — Dissolve 2}i oz.

heat together over a gentle fire till they simmer, remove ,the 
scum, and, when sufficiently cool, add }i oz. of oil of sassafras 
dissolved in two pints of rectified spirit, and 24 fluid ounces of

CALICO PRINTERS* FAST DYES. 

Dya-stufk used by calico-printers for producing fast colors.— 
The mordants are thickened with gum, or calcined starch, wh^n 
applied with the block, rollers, plates, or pencil. 

Black. — The cloth is impregnated with acetate of iron (isoe 
liquor), and died in a bath of madder and logwood. 

Purple. — ^The preceding mordant of iron, diluted; with the 
same dyeing bath. 

Crimson. — ^The mordant for purple, united with a portion af 
acetate of alumina, or red mordant, and the above bath. 

Red. — Acetate of alumina is the mordant, and madder is the 
dye-stuflF. 

Pale Red cf different shades. — ^The preceding mordant, dilut«)< 
with water, and a weak madder bath. 

Brown, or Pompadour. — A mixed mordant, containing a some- 
what larger proportion of the red than of the black, and the 
dye of madder. 

Orange. — The red mordant; and a bath, first of madder, and 
then of quercitron. 

Yellow. — A strong red mordant; and the quercitron batli, 
whose temperature should be considerably under the boiling 
point of water. 

Blue. — Indigo, rendered soluble and greenish-yellow colore^ 
iy potash and orpiment. - It recovers its blue color by exposuHi 
to air, and thereby also fixes firmly on the cloth. An indif^o 
vat is also made, with that blue substance difiiised in water with 
quicklime and copperas. These substances are supposed to d«- 
oxidize indigo, and at the satne time to render it soluble. 

Golden-dye. — ^The cloth is immersed alternately in a splntioa 
of copperas and lime-water. The protoxide of iron precipitatnd 
«n the fiber, soon passes, by absorption of atmospherical oxyga^ 
into the golden-colored deutozide.

5. Blue. — Stain them green, then steep them in a hot and 
strong solution of pearlash. 

Remarks. — ^Xhe bones of living animals may bt dyed by mix- 
ing madder with theirfood. The bones of young pigeons may 
thus be tinged of a rose-color in 24 hours, and of a deep scarlet 
in 3 days; but the bones of adult animals take a fortnight to ac- 
quire a rose-color. The bones nearest the heart become tinged 
quickest. In the same way extract of logwood will tilige the 
bones of young pigeons purple.

when the water is boiling, and put the clothes in while boiling. 
Each lot of linen must boil half an hour, and the same liquid 
will answer for three batches of clothes. The white clothes 
must be put in soak over night, and if the collars and wristbands 
are soaped and rubbed lightly, so much the better, Clean colS 
water may be used for rincing. Some prefer boiling them for 
a few moments in clean blueing water, and afterwards rince in 
cold water. The cloths may not appear perfectly white while 
wet, but when dry will be clear white. 

Muak. — ^Artificial Musk is made by dropping 3^ ounces of 
nitric add on one ounce of rectified oil of amber. In a day on 
two, a black substance is produced, which smells similar to 
genuine miisk. 

Mahogany Furniture. — Stains and spots may be taken out of 
mahogany furniture by the use of a little aaquafortis, or oxalic 
add and water, by rubbing the part with the li«[uid, by means 
of a cork, till the color is restored, observing afterwards to well

purpose of defending it from the attacks of the little insect, the 
dermestes lardarius, which, hy laying its eggs in it, soon fills it 
with its larvse, or maggots. This troublesome and expensive 
process may be altogether superseded by the use of pyroligne- 
ous acid. With a painter's brush, dipped in the liquid, one man, 
in the course of a day, may effectually secure two hundred hams 
from all danger. Care should be taken to insinuate the liquid 
into all the cracks, etc., of the under surface. This method is 
especially adapted to the preservation of hams in hot climates. 

India-Rubber Blacking. — {Bryant and James' Paste.) — Ivory

Alterative Syrup. — American Sarsaparilla, Yellow Dockroot, 
Black Alder-bark, Prickly Ash-bark, Burdock-root, Sassafras- 
bark, Wintergreen, of each one ounce, makefourpints of syrup. 
Dose, a wineglassfuU, three or four times a day. This syrup is 
useful in all diseases where the blood or general system needs 
purifying. 

Bite of a Mad Dog. — Spirits of Hartshorn is said to be a certain 
remedy for the bite of a mad dog. The wound should be con- 
stantly bathed with it, and three or four dosea, diluted, taken 
inwardly, during the day. The hartshorn decomposes chemical- 
ly the virus insinuated into the wound, and immediately altera 
and destroys its deleteriousness. The writer, who resided in 
Brazil for some time, first tried it for the bite of a scorpion, and 
found that it removed pain and inflamation almost instantly. 
Subsequently, he tried it for the bite of the rattlesnake, with 
similar success. At the suggestion of the writer, an old friend 
and physician tried it in cases of Hydrophobia and always with 
BuecsBS.

water for one hour, then strain and sweeten with loaf sugar. 
Gargle the tliroat for ten or fifteen minutes at a time with this 
(nfusion; likewise a table-spoonful may be held in the mouth for 
some minutes; after which drink two table-spoonfuls of it Re- 
peat it several times a day, until a cure is effected. 

Cough Ca/irf/.— Cheap, Safe, and Excellent.— Take equal parts 
of Boneset, Spikenard, Elecampane, Comfrey, and Wild Cherry 
bark; make a strong decoction; to every pint of this decoction 
add molasses a pint; extract of liquorice, four ounces; and honey 
four ounces. Boil down to a proper consistence for forming a 
candy, when add oil of tar, one drachm; essence of sassafras, 
two teaspoonfuls. Work it up into a candy form by hand in 
the usual way. It may bi en freely. 

Bronzing of Medals. — Omamen..^ of copper, electrotypes, etc.— ■ 
Having thoroughly cleaned and polished the surface of the 
specimen, with a brush apply the common crocus-powder, pre- 
viously made into a paste with water. When dry, place it in an 
iron ladle, or on a common fire-shovel over a clear fire for about 
one minute; and when sufficiently cool, polish with a plate-brush. 
By this process a bronze similar to that on tea-urns is produced; 
the shade depending upon the duration of the exposure to the 
fire. 

1. By substituting finely powdered plumbago for crocus-pow- 
der in the above process, a beautiful, deep and permanent bronze 
appearance is produced. 

2. Rub the medal with a solution of livers of sulphur, or 
sulphuret of potassium, then dry. This produces the appearance 
of Antique bronze very exactly. 

Surface Bronzing. — ^This term is applied to the process for im- 
parting to the surfaces of figures of wood, plaster of Paris, etc., 
a metallic appearance, this is done by first giving them a coat 
of oil or size-varnish, and when this is nearly dry, applying with 
a dabber of cotton or a camel-hair pencil, any of the metallic 
bronze powders; or the powder may be placed in a little bag of 
muslin, and dusted over the surface, and afterwards finished off 
with a wad of linen. This surface must be afterwards varnished. 

Paper is bronzed by mixing the powders up with a little gum 
aii^ water, and afterwards buitiishing. 



78 BOOK. OF KNOWLS;rff>te 

Iron Castings may be bronzfid by thorougn cteamug, and Bdj- 
sequent immersioa in a solution of sulphate or copper, wn en 
they acquire a coat of th« latter metal. They must fae then 
washed in water. 

Buffer or Milk. — ^To remrwe its Turnip Flavor. This is said to 
be removed by either of tne following methods: When the milk 
is strained into the pan*, put to every six gallons one gallon oif 
boiling water. Or dissolve one ounce of flitre in a pint of spring 
water and put X pitit 'O every fifteen gallons of milk. 

Sillier Jelly. — ^Time to boil the feet, five hours and a half; to 
boil the jelly, twenty minutes. One set of calf's feet; one ounce 
of isinglass; one pint of the best gin; one pound of loaf sugar; 
juice of six lemons; peel of two; white of six eggs. Boil the 
calf s feet in four quarts of water, with the isinglass, until the 
feet are done to rags, and the water wasted to half the quantity; 
strain it, and when cold remove the feet, and the jelly from the 
sediment very carefully. Put the jelly into a stew-pan with the 
sugar, the juice of the lemons, and the peel of two; add the gin. 
When the flavor is thoroughly drawn from the lemon-peel, put 
in the whites of the eggs well beaten, and their shells broken 
up, place the stew-pan over the fire, and let it boil for twenty 
minutes, but do not stir in after the egg has been added. Dip a 
jelly-bag into hot water and squeeze it dry: run the jelly through 
it several times, until quite clear, and then pour it into the 
mould. If calf 8 feet cannot be obtained, two ounces of gelatine; 
and one ounce of isinglass will do as well. 

Gilding of Porcelain, Glass, etc. — ^This is performed by blending 
powdered gold with gum-water and a little borax, and applying 
it by means of a camel-hair pencil; the article is then heated 
sufficiently hot in an oven or furnace, by which means the giim 
is burnt, and the borax vitrifying cements the gold to the sur- 
face. When cold it is polished off with a burnisher. Names, 
dates, or any fancy device may thus be permanently and easily 
fixed on glass, china, earthenware, etc. 

Gilding of Silk, efc. — Silks, satins, woolens, ivory bones, etc., 
may be readily gilded by immersing them in a solution of nitro- 
muriate (terchloride) of gold (l of the salt to 3 or 4 water), and 
then exposing them to the action of hydrogen -gas. The latter 
part of the process may readily be performed by pouring some

diluted snipburic acid, or zinc or iron filings, in a bottle, and 
placing it under a jar or similar vessel, inverted at the top of 
which the articles to be gUded are to be suspended. 

The foregoing experiment may be very prettily and advantage- 
onsly varied as follows: paint flowers or other ornaments with a 
very fine camel-hair pencil, dipped in the above-mentioned 
solution of gold, on pieces of silk, satin, etc., and hold them 
over a Florence flask, from which hydrogen-gas is evolved, 
during the decomposition of the water by isulphuric acid and 
iron-filings. The painted flowers, etc., in a ;few minutes will 
shine with all the splendor of the purest gold. A coating of 
this kind will not tarnish on exposure to the air, or in washing 

Gilding Varnish. — ^This is oil-gilding applied to equipages, 
picture-frames, furniture, etc., the surface being highly varnish- 
ed and poUshed before it receives the size or gold color; and then, 
after the gilding has become quite dry, a coat of spirit varnish, 
fumed with the chafing-dish as above, is applied, followed by 
two or three coats of the best copal varnish, after which the 
work is carefully polished with tripoli and water. 

Sliders' Varnish.— Vte.'p. — Beeswax, 4 ounces, verdigris and 
sulphate of copper, of each I ounce; mix. 

Fire-eating. — ^The power of resisting the action of fire is given 
to the skin by frequently washing it with diluted sulphuric acid, 
until the part becomes sufiicienlly callous. It is said that the 
following mixture is very efficacious: — dilute sulphuric acid 3 
parts; sal ammoniac, I part; juice of onions, 2 parts; mix. It ia 
the acid, however, that produces the efiect. 

Impressions from Coins. — A very easy and elegant way of tak- 
the impressions of medals and coins, not generally known, is as 
follows. — Melt a little isinglass-glue with brandy, and pour It 
thinly over the medal, so as to cover its whole surface; let it re- 
main on for a day or two, till it has thoroughly dried and 
hardened, and then take it off, when it will be fine, clear, and as 
iiard as a piece of Muscovy glass, and will have a very elegant 
Impression of the coin. It will also resist the effects of damp 
air, which occasions alP other kinds of glue to soften and bend 
if not prepared in this way. (Shaw.) If the wrong side ol the 
isinglass be breathed on, and gold leaf applied, it will adhere, 
tnd be seen of the other side producing a very plea»ln^ elfer*;

Isinglass-glne, made with water alone, will do "nearly" as «dt 
as if brandy be used. 

Leaf-gilding. — This term is applied to the gilding of paper, 
vellum, etc., by applying leaf-gold to the surface, previously 
prepared with a coating of gum- water, size, or white of an egg. 
it is usually finished with an agate burnisher. 

Letter-gilding.'nie letters of signboards and similar ornamental 
gilding for outdoor work, is done by first covering the design 
with yellow or gold-color paint, then with oil gold size, and 
when this is nearly dry, applying the leaf-gold, observing to 
Shield it properly from the wind, lest it be blown away or be- 
come crumpled before being properly attached. This gilding is 
usually varnished. 

Mahogany Stains. — Pure Socotrine aloes, ounce,dragon's blood, 
}i ounce, rectified spirit, i pint; dissolve and apply 2 or 3 coats 
to the surface of the wood, finish off with wax or oil, tinged with 
alkauet. 

Simple Cosmetic. — Soft soap yi pound; melt over a slow fire 
with a gill of sweet oil, add half a jteacupful of fine sand, and 
stir the mixture together until cold. The shelly sea-sand, 
sifted from the shells, has been found better than that which has 
no shells. 

Remarks. — This simple cosmetic, has for several years past 
been used by many ladies who are remarkable for the delicate 
softness and whiteness of their hands, which they in a great 
measure, attribute to the use of it. Its cheapness is a strong 
recommendation. 

Essence of Patchouli. — Indian patchouli-leaves, 2 pounds; rec- 
tified spirit of wine, 9 pints; water, a gallon. Macerate for one 
week, freqi>ently shaking the vessel, then distill over exactly one 
gallon. A very fashionable perfume. 

Essence af Roses, (odorous) — ^Veiy fine article.-^ Attar of roses, 
I ounce; spirit of wine, i gallon. Mix in a close vessel, and 
assist the solution by placing it in a bath of hot water. As soon 
as the spirit gets warm, take it from the water and shake till 
quite cold. The next day filter. UnlesI the spirit of wine be 
of more than the common strength, it will not retain the whole 
©f the attar in solution in very cold weather.

CoHee Milk. — Boil a dessert-spoonful of ground coffee in about 
a pint of milk a quarter of an hour; then put into it a shaving or 
two of isinglass and clear it; let it boil a few minutes, and set it 
on the side of the fire to fine. This is a very fine breakfast, and 
should be sweetened with real Lisbon sugar.

finely ground vermilion. Mix well, remove the heat, and when 
the mass has cooled a little, add essence of roses [attar?] 3 oz,; 
do. of cloves and cinnamon, of each, one ounce; bergamot 2}i 
ounces; mix well, run the liquid mass through a tammy-cloth, 
and put it into the frames. If the soaps employed are not new, 
one or two quarts of water must be added to make them melt 
easily. A very fine article.

PRINTING INK. 



Printing Inlc. — 10 to 12 gallons of linseed-oil are set ever the 
fire in an iron pot capable of containing at least as much more, 
to allow of its swelling without running over. When it boils it 
is kept stirred with an iron ladle, and if it does not take fire of 
itself soon after the smoke begins to rise, it is kindled by means 
of a piece of burning paper, stuck in the cleft end of a long stick 
The pot is then shortly afterwards removed from the fire, an( 
the oil is suffered to burn for about half an hour, or till a sample 
of the varnish cooled upon a pallet knife, may be drawn into 
strings of about half an inch long, between the fingers. The 
flame is now extinguished by the application of a close-fitting 
tin cover, and as soon as the froth of the ebullition has subsided, 
black rosin is added, in the proportion of 6 pounds, to every 6 
quarts of oil thus treated; the mixture is next stirred until the 
rosin is dissolved, when i^ lbs. of brown soap, cut into slices 
is further added (cautiously), and the ingredients are again 
stirred with the spatula until united, the pot being once more 
placed over the fire to promote the combination. When this is 
effected, the varnish is removed from the heat, and after thorough 
stirring, covered over and set aside. It is necessary to prepare 
two kinds of this varnish, varying in consistence, from more or 
less boiling, to be occasionally mixed together as circumstances 
require; that which answers well in hot weather being too thick 
in cold, and vice versa. Large characters also require a thinner 
ink than small ones. A good varnish may be drawn into threads 
like glue, and is very thick and tenacious,

pounds; Lest vegetable lampblack, Z/4 pounds; put them into a 
suitable vessel and mix in gradually the warm varnish. The 
mixture must now be submitted to careful grinding, either in a 
mill or with a slab aud muUer. On a large scale steam power is 
employed for this purpose. 

(An extemporaneous superfine ink). Balsam of copaiba (pure) 
9 ounces; lampblack, 3 ounces; Indigo and Prussian Blue, of 
each,5 drachms; Indian Red.J^ ounces; yellow soap (dry), 3 oz., 
grind to an impalpable smoothness. Canada balsam may be 
substituted for balsam of copaiba where the smell of the latter 
is objectionable, but it dries quicker. 

Remarks. — Old linseed-oil is preferable to new. Yellow rosin 
soap is preferred for black and dark-colored inks, and white-cure 
soap for light ones. Vegetable lampblack takes the most varnish. 
The addition c<f Indigo and Prussian Blue is to correct the brown 
oolor of the bUck. The Indian red is added to increase the body 
■md richness of color. Some persons find much trouble in grind- 
ing up the indigo, from its running into a mass and clogging the 
mill; but this may be avoided by mixing it as above, or by first 
grinding it with sufficient quantity of Canada balsam or copaiba, 
and using a proportionate quantity of varnish and that of a little 
thicker consistence. The French employ nut-oil instead of lin- 
seed. Mr. Savage obtained the large medal of the Society of 
Arts for his black ink made as above. It is unrivaled. Colored 
inks are made in a similar way. The pigments used are, carmine, 
lake, vermilion, chrome red, red lead, orange red, Indian red, 
Venetian red, orange chrome, chrome yellow, burnt terra di 
Siena, gallstone, Roman ochre, yellow do., verdigris, Scheie's 
green, Schweinfurth's do., blues and yellows mixed for greens, 
indigo, Prussian blue, Antwerp do., cobalt do., charcoal do., 
luster, nmber, sepia, etc., etc. 

Paper Copying. — Make a stiff ointment with butter or lard and 
lampblack, and smear it thinly and evenly over soft writing- 
paper, by means of a piece of flannel, then wipe off the re- 
dundant portion with a piece of soft rag. Placed on paper and 
written on with a style, or solid pen. By repeating the arrange- 
ment, two or three copies of a letter may be obtained at once. 
This paper, set up in a case, forms the ordinary manifold writer.

design upon the Papier-mache, and decided upon the part to be 
inlaid with Pearl, take your nippers and cut or nip the pearl to 
your shape, which is afterwards to be finished with the file to 
the exact form required. You will now mix in a gallipot a 
small quantity of Gold Size and Vegetable Black, to the consis- 
tency of Ti-eacle; and taking a large brush, lay a rather thick 
coating upon the whole of Papier-mache. You will then stick 
on the pieces of pearl before cut out, according to your design, 
and let it remain until dry, which will be 24 hours. The surtace 
of your Papier-mache being perfectly dry, take Black Japan 
and give it a thick and even coating over the whole surface, not 
excepting the Pearl. It will require to be placed in an o\en of 
some sort, quite free from dust, and heat about 145 degreeo; but 
this is not particular, so long as it does iiot get hotter. It wilS 
be dry iu 24 hours, when to test its dryness, dip a rag in spirit 
of turpentine, and brush the edge of the papier-mache; if it soils 
the rag, it is not dry, and requires to be again] stoved. The 
articles require four coats of japan, and the above process to be 
repeated on each coat, the beauty of the articles entirely depend- 
ing on the japan being perfectly dry and hard. A piece of 
pumice-stone, rubbed flat on a flag, niust now be dipped in water, 
and rubbed on the papier-mache urtil it brings the whole to a 
level surface, and shows the pearl. Fine pumice powder and 
water upon a bit of list is now applied to remove the scratches 
made by the pumice-stone. Polish with putty powderupon a 
piece of wash-leather. 

If your desigh consists of flowers, etc., color the parts as re- 
quired with powder colors, mixed up with copal varnish, and 
diluted with turpentine, using nature as a guide. The orna- 
mental parts, not consisting of flowers, are to be painted and 
gilded according to your fancy. For gilding, take gold size and 
mix a little chrome yellow, ^ith which draw your design, and 
when partially dry in 5 or 10 minutes cut gold leaf in small pieces, 
apply it, and dab it on with cotton wool- lb 5 or 10 minutes

after rub the cotton lightly over the surface, to remove the 
superfluous pieces of gold. When the coloring is dry, varnish

The Arabian Charm for Taming Horses. — The horse castor is a 
wart or excrescence which grows on every horse's fore-legs, and 
generally on the hind-legs. It has a peculiar rank, musty smell, 
and is easily pulled off. For the Oil of Cumin the horse is said 
to have an instinctive passion, and the Oil of Rhodium possesses 
some very peculiar properties for animals. Produce some horse 
castor and grate it fine — also get some Oil of Rhodium and Oil 
«jf Cumin, and keep the three separate in Mr-tight bottles. Rub 
A little Oil of Cumin upon the hand, and approach the horse in 
the field on the windward side, so that He can smelV the Cutain— 
when he approaches, immediately rub your hand gently upon 
the horse's nose, getting a little oil on it. Then give him a lit. 
tie of the castor on a pietc of loaf sugar, apple, or potato. Thesr.

obtained by boiling the kernel of the fruit of a tree resembling 
the walnut, called in Malay, Badeau. The oil is mixed with 
other ingredients, and has a smell approaching to that of cre- 
osote. But the Macassar-oil sold iu this country has probably 
no relation to the above, except in name. The following is

Mrs. 

For Apliides. — Boil 2 oz. of lime and i oz. of sulphur in water, 
and strain. 

For Red Spiders. — A teaspoonful of salt in a gallon of water. 
In a few days wash the plant with pure water. 

To Mark on Glass. — Glass may be written on for temporary 
purposes, by French chalk; pencils of this substance will be 
found convenient. Glass may be written on with ink, if the 
surface be clean and dry, and the pen held nearly perpendicular. 

The shellac ink is the best for labels, as it resists damp, etc. 
"To scratch glass," a scratching diamond is used, ir a piece of 
flint, or crystal of quartz, or the point of a small three square 
file. "To engrave on glass," fluoric acid is used, either in the 
liquid state or in vapor. The glass must be warmed, and coated 
with wax or engravers' cement, and the writing or design traced 
through the wax with a bradawl or other pointed instrument. 
The liquid fluoric acid is poured on it, and left to act on the un. 
covered portions of the glass; or the fluor-spar may be powdered 
and made into a paste with oil of vitriol, and laid over the pre. 
pared surface, and covered with lead-foil or tea-lead: or bruisedi 
fluor-spar is put on a Wedgewood evaporating basin, with 
suflScient oil of vitriol to form a thin paste, and the prepared 
glass laid over the basin, so that the vapors may act on the por- 
tions from which the wax has been removed. "To cut glass," 
(besides the usual method of dividing cut glass by a glaziers 
diamond), the following means may be used: To divide glass 
tubes or rods, form a deep mark around them with the edge of a 
three square file: then with a hand placed on either side of the 
mark, break the rod with a slightly stretching as well as bending 
motion, A diamond or sharp flint may be substituted for a file. 
Flasks, globes, and retorts, ma^ be divided by means of iron 



BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE. gx 

4 ■ ' . 

rings, having a stem fixed in a wooden handle. Make the ring 
red-hot, and applj' it to the flask, etc. If the vessel does not 
break where it came it contact with the ring, wet the part, and 
it will generally separate. Another method is to twist together 

2 or 3 threads of cotton, such eis is used for wicks: moisten them 
with spirit of wine, and encircle the flask with them; then, 
holding the flask horizontally, set fire to the wick, and turn the 
flask with the fingers, so as to keep the flame in the direction 
of the thread. If the separation does not take place the first 
time, the process may be repeated after the glass has cooled. 
By these means a common oil-flask may be divided into an 
evaporating dish and a funnel. By means of a stout iron rod, 
fixed in a wooden handle, and terminating in a blunt point and 
heated to redness,- broken retorts, globes, and flasks, may be 
converted into useful evaporating dishes, etc. If any crack ex- 
ists, it may easily be led in any direction, as it will follow the 
motion of the heated iron, if no crack exists one must be 
produced by applying the point of the heated rod to any 
convenient spot on the edge of the broken glass, touching it 
afterwards with a moistened finger, if necessary. The edges 
of glass thus divided are rendered less apt to break by heating 
them in the flame of a blowpipe, or grinding them smooth 
with emery on a flat stone. 

To Silver Glass. — The term "silvering" is applied to the pro- 
cess of coating the surface of glass with amalgamated tin foil, in 
forming mirrors. The tinfoil is rubbed over with quicksilver, 
and more of the latter poured over it; the plate of glsss, perfect- 
ly clean and dry, is then applied to it in such a way as to exclude 
all air-bubbles, and to bring the glass and foil into perfect con- 
tacti The plate, after being inclined so as to allow the super- 
fluous quicksilver to drain off, is loaded with weights, [under 
which it remains till the adhesion is complete. To convex and 
concave mirrors, the amalgamated foil is applied by accurately 
fitting plaster moulds. The interic-r of globes is silvered by in- 
troducing a liquid amalgam, and turning about the globe till 
every part is covered with it. But a method of literally silvering 
glass has lately been patented by Mr. Drayton. He mixes i oz. 
of nitrate of siver, 3 oz. of water, i ounce of liquid ammonia, end 

3 oz. of spirit of wine, and filter the solution after it has stood 3 
or 4 hours. To every ounce of solution he adds % oz. of sugar 



BOOK OF KNOWLEDGB. 



(grape sugar, if possible,) dissolved in equal quantities of water 
and alcohol. The surface to be silvered is covered with this 
liquid, and a temperature of 160° F. maintained, till the deposi- 
tion of the silver is complete. When ouite dry, the coated s»r- 
face is covered with mastic varnish. 

Cement for Steam Pipes. — Good linseed-oil varnish, ground with 
equal weights of white lead, oxide of manganese, and pipeclay. 

Inks. — ^The following are specimens of the most useful kinds 
of ink: — 

B/ack Writing-ink. — Bruised Aleppo galls, 6 oz. ; soft water, 6 
pints. Boil together, add 4 oz. of sulphate of iron, and 4 oz. of 
gum arable. Put the whole in a bottle, and keep it in a warm 
place, shaking it occasionally. In two months pour it off into 
glass bottles, and add to each pint a grain of corrosive sublimale, 
t)r 3 or 4 drops of creosote. Add one ounce of brown sugar to 
the above, and it will make good copying ink. 

Blue Ink. — Prepare a solution of iodide of iron from iodine, 
iron, and water; add to the solution half as much iodine as fiist 
used, pour this solution into semi-saturated solution of fert 0- 
prussiate of potash, containing nearly as much of the salt as the 
whole weight of iodine. Collect the precipitate, wash it, and 
finally dissolve it in water, to form the blue ink. The so- 
lution from which the precipitate is separated, evaporated to 
dryness, and the residue fused, re-dissolved and crystalized, 
yields pure iodide of potassium. This process is patented. 

Gold and Silver -Ink. — Fine bronze-powder, or gold, or silvsr 
leaf, ground with a little sulphate of potash, and washed from 
the salt, is mixed with water, and a sufficient quantity of gutn. 

Ink for Marking Linen. — Nitrate of silver, 100 grains; distilled 
water, I ounce; gum arable, 2 drachms; sap green, a scruple. 
Dissolve. The linen is first to be wetted with the following 
"pounce," dried and rubbed smooth, then written on by a clefin 
quill or bone pen dipped in the ink. Pounce: Subcarbonate Df 
soda, I ounce; water, 8 ounces. 

Indelible Ink. — Take 20 parts of Dantzig potash, 10 of tanned 
leather parings, and 5 of sulphur; boil them in an iron pot wilh 
sufficient water to dryness; then raise the heat, stirring the mat- 
ter'constantly, till the whole becomes soft, taking care that it 
does not ignite. Add sufficient water, and filter through clotJi. 
it must be kept from the air. It resists many chemical agents.

Oilding. — Leaf-gold is affixed to various surfaces, properly pre- 
pared by gold size, or other adhesive medium. Metallic sur- 
faces are coated with gold by means ef amalgam of geld and 
mercury, applied with a wire brush, wet with an acid solution of 
mercury, made by dissolving 10 parts of mercury in 11 of nitric 
add, by a gentle heat, and adding 2% parts of water. The 
article thns coated is heated over charcoal till the mercury is 
dissipated, ahd afterwards burnished. To give it a redder color, 
it is covered with gilder's wax (a compound of verdjgps, ochre, 
alum, and yellow wax), again exposed to heat, andS|Mlerward8 
washed and cleaned by a scratch-brush and vinegar. An inferior 
4ind of gilding is effected by dissolving gold, with a fifth of its 
weight of copper, in nitro-muriatic acid, dipping rags in the so- 
/ution, drying and burning them, and rubbing the ashes on the 
■netallic surface with a cork dipped in salt and water. 

Electro Gilding is \\vxs performed: — A solution of 5 oz. of gold 
is prepared and boiled till it ceases to give out yellow vapors; 
the clear solution is mixed with 4 gallons of water, 20 pounds ol 
bicarbonate of potash added, "bnd the whole boiled for two hours. 
The articles, properly cleaned, are suspended on wires, and 
moved about in the liquid from a few seconds to a miiiute, then 
washed, dried, and colored in the usual way. The sdndon used 
in gilding with the voltaie apparatus is made by dissolving }i 
ounceef oxide of geld with 2 ounces of cyanide of potassium, 
in a pint ot distilled water. 

Balls for Cleaning C/o^Aes.— Bathbrick,4parts;pq)eclay,8part8;
