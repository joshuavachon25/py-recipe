The College Woman's 
cook'book 




First Edition 



The compiling and publishing 
^ ^ _ of this book of recipes has 
been the work of a group of college 
women, living in and near Evan- 
ston, 111., most of whom are grad- 
uates of Northwestern University. 

A portion of the profit accru- 

^ ing from the publishing of 

this cook-book is to be given each 
year for the support of a summer 
camp in Michigan, where unfortu- 
nate kiddies from the cities are 
given a real vacation. 



Over 2,500 college women, 
_ _ most of them housewives, 
were asked for their best tested 
recipes. From those submitted, 
500 of the best and most unusual 
have been selected and published 
in this handy volume. By follow- 
ing the names under each recipe, it 
will be observed that leading col- 
leges in all parts of the United 
States and Canada are represented.
