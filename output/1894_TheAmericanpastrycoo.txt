rpHIS BOOK is especially adapted for use in Hotels, Boarding-HoiiBes, 
-■- Confectionery-Caf^s, Eestaiirants and Eating-Houses generally, in which 
respect it enters upon a field hitherto unoccupied. The quantities of the 
receipts are calculated for what experience has taught the author are the 
avei'age orders of about fifty persons choosing from a bill of fare, but 
which are really only about thirty portions. In many of the more import-, 
ant matters, such as Puff Paste, Bread and EoUs, Cakes, Ices, Creams, and 
Pie Mixtures, and in Cold Meat Dishes, Corned Beef management, and 
Salads, the standard of one pound or quart used will be found to make the 
receipts equally useful for private families, and the trouble of dividing the 
larger quantities in other cases will probably be fully repaid by the simple 
conciseness of the directions, the absence of all technical jargon, aud the 
professional knowledge of the art of cookery imparted in every page. The 
book is unique also in having all the articles directed to be made graded 
in regard to cost, to meet the requirements both of those who do cooking 

m 

fov pleasure and those who are concerned in cooking for profit. 



Since the above was first printed another book has been issued by the 
same author, in- which all of the receipts are reduced to the guage of meals 
for six or eight. It is especially adapted to teach cooking as a trade for 
women in private houses, and includes everything likely to be of use for 
the purpose, arranged in order from the cheapest meals up to party dinners 
and suppers. It is called the Chicago Herald Cooking School. 



Introductory in the National Hotel Reporter. 



For any appurent presumptuousness there may be 
in spreading these cooking receipts and instructions 
before the professed cooks of the country in the most 
widely circulated and most influential hotel journal, 
I have to offer as apology that I was long ago im- 
pressed with the singular fact, that among idl the ex- 
cellent cooks, hardly any could be found who worked 
by any rule or measure. This was especially the 
case with American cooks. They knew how them- 
selves, but could not have given exact instructions 
even to their sons without first instituting a series of 
experiments, and their knowledge perished with 
them. 1 simply set to work to reduce my portion of 
the general knowledge to exact figures, and the merit 
claimed therefore is not for very extraordinary 
skill, but rather for the painstaking industry that 
has never allowed a receipt to be put away marked 
O. K., without being satisfied that it was quite re- 
liable. 

Another consideration offered is, that the stewards, 
and others, who buy for cooks to use, not being, in 
the great majority of cases, practical cooks them- 
selves, are apt to consider many of the demands of 
the cooks for certain kinds of materials necessary to 
good work, as but unreasonable whims, not worthy 
of notice, and it is difficult to see how the requisite 
explanations are ever to be made, unless through 
some such means and medium as the present,

RBOBIPT OR RBOIPB? 



Which is right? Worcester says that a recipe is a 
receipt for cooking ; also, that it is a formulary or 
prescription for mixing certain articles, particularly 
in medicine. Webster, also, makes recipe and re- 
ceipt appear nearly synonymous terms, and attaches 
to the former a particularly medical meaning that is 
nowhere made to belong to the other.. The French 
reeetU, which appears to be the original of our re- 
ceipt, is pronounced like it; and yet aU the translated 
French books have recipe instead. Of half a dozen 
different articles on the grocer's shelves, four have 
recipes printed on the packages while others give re. 
ceipts. Of six persons talking together, four or five 
will say recipe, the rest receipt. The label on the 
bottle tells you that the sauce beside your plate was 
prepared from the receipt of a nobleman of the 
county. But the nobleman's only authoritative 
English cook-book uses recipe. By its side is another 
later and very compendious work which is adver- 
tised as containing so many thousand receipts. Still 
another more recent and even more compendious 
London book, uses the other word. Both words are 
right, but which is the better? 

Several hundred pages of the matter which it is 
proposed to publish in this column, had been writ- , 



ten with the word recipe, according to the observed 
practice of the minority, but after all it was decided 
to change it, and for reasons perhaps as immaterial 
as the difference between the two words in question. 
Still, the minority side having been taken, it seems 
best to state the case. 

A city man, wise in the ways of bread making, 
was at an old Yankee farmer^ s house instructing 
his housekeeper in the best methods of making home- 
made Boston brown bread, and used the word recipe 
frequently. The old man was not illiterate, but ex- 
cessively old-fashioned, and the trisyllable annoyed 
him past bearing. He laid down the Churehman that 
he had been reading, and leaned back and listened. 
Then he took off his glasses. Then he began to re- 
monstrate. "Oh, don't bring those affected city 
words among us plain people. *Recipee,' " he re- 
peated, with immeasurable contempt. "My parents 
always said receipt ; my neighbors all say receipt, 
what would they think of us if we should go among 
them putting on such airs as that?" 

As I overheard this, and a cutting phillipio which 
followed, aimed at city affectations in general, my 
fiuth in the power of high-sounding recipe to soothe 
the savage breast was considerably weakened. A long 
time after, and at a very distant place, a lady school 
teacher was heard to say : "I am so glad if receipt is 
the right word instead of recipe ; the latter seems so 
much like a stranger in a foreign dress among our 
fi&miliar English words of the same dimensions. 
When I have taught my pupils to indite and recite, 
it is troublesome to make them understand that rec- 
ipe is not to be pronounced that way at all, and then, 
again, to stop them from making two syllables of 
ripe, wipe, and pipe." 

This was another blow at the aristocratic trisyllable, 
but it seemed hard to have to descend from the lofty 
heights where it prevailed to the level of the com- 
mon. Fortunately, just at that time, the great house 
of the Harpers published the most polite cook-book 
that has yet appeared. It made extreme correctness 
a special feature. It was typographically perfect. 
It hyplienated every cocoanut It split hairs on tea- 
spoonful. It followed Noah Webster whithersoever 
he might lead. It was "theglassof fkshion and the 
mould — I mean mold — of form," and with all this it 
adopted receipt instead of recipe. 

There was no more room for doubt. Higher prece- 
dent there could not be, and so, if the reader pleases, 
as far as this column is concerned, we will render 
unto the doctors the Latin trisyllable which is their, 
and use only the humbler but safer English receipt. 



NOTES TO THE SECOND EDITION. 



The *< American Pastry Cook" having met with so 
mnch faTor that a second edition has become neces- 
sary, it may perhaps be allowed me to make a state- 
ment of the simple origin of the book, as much as 
anything in acknoMrledgment of the kind encourage- 
ment of a great number of friends who bought un- 
doubtedly without any thought of using it. All 
such books, if worth considering at all, have had a 
motiTO, either to introduce foreign methods, found 
a new school of cookery, teach new extremes of or- 
namentation, or put into practice the theories of 
great chemists or of new idea doctors — Leibig, 
Graham, the Tegetarians and the like. The "OTen 
and Range ' series was not so deliberately planned 
and if a motive may be claimed in this case it is to 
make good cooks, such as are always wanted, and 
to raise the occupation of cooks in America at least 
to the dignity of a recognized trade. 

When, a good many years ago, I used to find my- 
self in positions on sea and river, in hotels and re- 
taurants where the assistants always coming and 
going were generally willing enough while they 
stayed, but could nob-do good work, I began to see 
the absurdity of knowing what I wanted done and 
yet being unable to make others understand, and I 
began pencilling down weights, measures and direc- 
tions for them to work by — not pastries alone but a 
little of everything— and hanging these directions 
on the nails along with each assistant's portion of 
the bill of fare for the next meal. All coo' s that 
are worthy of being called such are emulative and 
try to excel. They *'hit it exactly" in making a 
dish, sometimes, are highly elated and wish they 
could always have such *'good luck." In my own 
practice whenever any of us **hit it exactly" I 
simply penciled doirn how it was done, and kept on 
changing and improving until I was in a great 
measure independent of the circumstances of the 
boys ^'jumping out;" anybody smart enough to 
work by written directions oould make what I told 
them. These receipts were necessarily plain, and 
as necessarily correct and reliable, and they were 
of great value. In course of time there were some 
hundreds of them and they made a bulky package. 
Is there any wonder that the thought occurred that 
they would be more useful in print? Is there any 
need to explain further why the writer has confi- 
dence in his book ? Those exact and plainly word- 
ed receipU, with others, of course added, form the 

' Oven and Range" cook books. There has been 
nothing but pleased surprise, kind words and good 



reports connected with the circulation of the pastry 
book as far as it has gone already, the anxiety being 
expressed in numberless instances to obtain more 
books of the same sort. The careful plan adopted of 
making the work reliable in every particular has 
prevented its being written and finished in haste. 



Little Desserts. — ^This book has been taken 
up with avidity by many outside of hotels, seeking 
instructions how to make nice sweet dishes, some 
of whom seem to think they know all tiiey need to 
learn of meat cooking when they can broil and fry, 
but who acknowledge the difficulty that prevails 
everywhere when well-to-do people ask why they 
cannot have at least a few of the dainty trifles at 
their private tables that they have enjoyed in such 
profusion at a few very good hotels. It is, briefly, 
because pastry-cooking cannot be picked up like 
meat frying, but must be learned. In order to help 
the matter I will suggest things to be tried. Let 
those who would not have pies every day and only 
pies, practice the different cream fllUngs and make 
all sorts of delectable forms of pastry of them. I 
have called some of these conserves because the 
word cream is worked to death. The articles allud- 
ed to are pineapple cream or conserve, apple cream, 
orange conserve or tart filling, lemon conserve or 
lemon honey,tran8parent pie mixture, cocoanut and 
lemon pie mixtures, pastry cream or custard,chooo- 
late cream, cheese curd mixtures, and many more 
that are in the book but which need not be named. 
Let it be observed that all of the receipts for mak- 
ing them are perfectly reliable and they can be 
taken up and used any time without fear of failure. 
This will be found a perfect little mine of good . 
things. When they- are understood make tarts in 
patty pans of them, then covered tarts, then cheese 
cakes, apple shortcake, Napoleon cake, Saratoga 
shortcake, apple turnovers, mince patties,using the 
different creams or sweets at different times. Then 
make the open tarts with meringue on top like 
lemon pies; make apple shortcakes with meringue 
or frosting on top or between the layers, and so you 
can keep on indefinitely. 

T'jen take notice of the ftruit charlotte^ the apple 
and peach charlottes and friar's omelet. Since the 
book has been published I have seen two of the most 
accomplished French cooks of this part of the 
country practicing those articles with others from ii 
with evident interest and satisfacUon — for. it does 



THE AMEBICAN PASTKY COOK. 



not follow because a maa is a splendid cook already 
that he must have practiced everythiog that is 
Vnown; we are all still learning or trying some old 
favorite for the first time. 

Then, attention should be paid to the many 
varieties of boiled custards in cups. There are 
tapioca custard, rice, feirina, sago, manioca, granula 
cocoanut, chocolate, caramel, wine, and plain cus- 
tards flavored. The receipts give you the exact 
proportions to make them so that everybody likes 
them, and they direct you to serve them ice cold. 
There are custards with whipped cream on top, and 
with fk>osting browned over, and custards baked 
and steamed. Then remember the different dishes 
made with cake and custard, the floating islands, 
the gipsey pudding and then the different ways of 
making a charlotte russe. 

I write these lines in the interest of people who 
want nice things on their tables and not caring par- 
ticularly about the cost wish to know how it is that 
cooks in general have such a very limited know- 
ledge of this line of business. As the utmost pains 
has been bestowed upon the book in the hope to 
supply this' deficiency of knowledge I can do no 
less than point them and their cooks to these pages. 

Then there are the molded creams, which to know 
how to make perfectly is a pleasing art in itself; 
they are the blanc manges, the Bavarian, chocolate, 
strawberry, Roman and all that line. Most of the 
finest foreign menus have Bavarian cream in some 
form or under some name as BavaroUe aux /raises 
(with strawberries) or au chocolat, or o'herwise, 
and many of the diplomatic and court banquets 
show the same. They all can be easily made and 
are simple when once learned. I have always found 
that something of the sort is highly appreciated at 
the end of a dinner, particularly when there is no 
ice cream. 

While claiming to excel in making these creams 
myself and having made others working under me 
excel in the same line of articles, I must own that 
I would not, to use the common expression, touch 
with a ten-foot pole these so-called creams as they 
are commonly made by unskillful cooks. But they 
are served daily in great perfection at a few of the 
very best Chicago hotels. Everything necessary to 
be said about them has been set down in the di- 
rections in the book. 

The puddings alone will furnish a change and 
variety that may surprise many who try them, and 
some are so little like pudding they seem to de- 
serve a finer name. Where all are good it is 
scarcely fair to single out any, yet, to point the 
meaning I wi'l instance the birds-nest pudding as 
being almost a dish of baked fruit, and, not least, 
there remain the fritters both plain and with fruit, 
meringues of oake and fruit and pastry and fruit, 
frosted over, and jellies and compotes, and every 
one who delights in making little desserts is con- 



tinually inventing some new combination. And 
we have not yet mentioned the ice creams. 



About WMpped Oream. — In close con- 
nection with the Bavarian and Italian creams the 
pure whipped cream regarded as most delicious 
among desserts has to be considered. Those creams 
when genuine are made of pure cream whipped to 
ftroth and stiffened with gelatine. 

The amount of gelatine required is only half an 
ounce to a quart of oream when it is but to fill a 
charlotte russe, or be a simple cream in a mold, 
but if strawberry juice and pulp is to be added 
or maraschino or wine then an ounce to a quart 
will be needed. If you put pure cream in a deep 
pan, set it on ice and be at with the wireegg- whisk it 
will become thick and firm enough to fill small 
charlottes without anything added at all, except, of 
course, a little sugar and flavoring, and it will not 
go down again as long as it is kept cold. 
• When the greater firmness is wanted so that it 
can be turned out of a mold the half-ounce of gel- 
atine to a quart must be dissolved in a little warm 
milk and poured into the cream while you are 
whipping it light. 

But there is so much difficulty in most hotels in 
getting cream for the pastry cook to use that I 
have about given up the use of it altogether. It is 
not ^ways the question of cost that makes the dif- 
ficulty but the actual scarcity of cream and the 
greater need for it in other ways than in the pastry, 
so the receipts for the made creams and charlottes 
will be found to call for no cream, but use milk in- 
stead. They can be made so good that the lack of 
cream is never observed. The difficulty does not 
so generally exist when parties in private houses 
are to be given and I advise the use of pure cream 
when possible, although it is valuable to know how 
to do without. 



Individual Oharlotte-Busse.— A favorite 
little dainty of this sort is sold at the city confec- 
tioneries that is made in a paper case, size and 
shape of a common tin cup of the half pint size. A 
sheet of sponge cake is baked on paper, taken off 
and cut in pieces that will just fit inside the cnses, 
a bottom piece is put in and then the charlotte is 
filled with a spoonful of whipped cream, sweetened 
and flavored but whipped up without gelatine. 
But they are made for fine parties in paper cases of 
the shape of small tumblers, wider at top than at 
bottom BO that they can be taken out of the 
case when served, as the pattern with straight- 
up sides cannot. These are lined with either cake 
or lady fingers, but to give them firmness enough 
to be removed from the cases a little gelatine has 
to be added to the pure cream, as explained in the 
note about whipped cream. 

But another way most suitable of all when these 



THE AMBBIOAK PA8TBY COOK. 



little charlottes are to be served at ball suppers, as 
they can be held in gloved fingers, is to make them 
in handsome ornamented paper cases, size of small 
tumblers which may be bought ready made for the 
purpose in some places or otherwise can be made of 
fine unruled paper at home. The lining may be 
sometimes of white oake and another time of yel- 
low, and either pure whipped cream or any of the 
made creams can be used for filling. The same 
sort of charlottes are held in high favor at hotel 
dinners when they are formed in deep muffin rings 
without bottoms, kept very cold and slipped out 
of the rings when served. I have practiced that 
more than any other way. A cup of pure thick 
cream when whipped fills about eight of these small 
charlottes, so that a calculation can be made of 
how much will be required. 

Individual Paddinffs.— It is the practice in 
all the best hotels to serve the puddings in individ- 
ual forms. In the receipts in this book it will be 
found that the baked puddings are all directed to 
be cooked first by boiling the main ingredients to- 
gether then adding the eggs and then to be baked 
only a short time. This baking is done in white 
bowls that hold f^om a cupful to a pint and the 
puddings are served in the same bowl set in a plate 
and an individual pitcher of sauce with it, if the 
pudding needs a sauce, for fi&mily dinners granite 
ware or tin dishes are in use with an outside silver- 
plated dish to hold it and a plated ring to drop 
over and cover the rim. Custard puddings, mac- 
aroon, brandy, cabinet and a number of others de- 
scribed in the book can be cooked in the cups snd 
then turned out in the saucers to serve. Boiled or 
steamed puddings can be cooked in individual tin 
molds and turned out on saucers. 

An improved way of cooking steamed apple roll 
and other fruit puddings of the same sort is prac- 
ticed in places where the steaming facilities are 
good. The pudding is not a roll at all and no 
cloth is used, but a crust rolled out is laid on the 
bottom of a pan, then a layer of chopped apples, 
another crust, more apples and a third crust on top, 
then it is set in the steamer, cut out slices or 
squares. It is but little trouble and does just as 
well. A light dough made with plenty of baking 
powder and no shortening whatever is employed in 
some of the paying restaurants for steamed apple 
roll. 



loes. — Let none be deceived about the ices in 
this book because they are offered without the im. 
poseiveness of tremendous French names. There is 
no finer assortment of ices known than these in the 
following pages. The changes and combinations 
possible with them are practically endless and one 
who is master of them need have no fear of ever 
"getting left * in a competitive trial. It is hard to 



say in such matters as these exactly where old pat- 
terns are departed from and originality begins. It 
is true, however, that these are all newly adap. 
ted to hotel use being on the whole an invention of 
a set of ways of serving a magnificent array of ices in 
places where the resort to molds and brick shapes 
was not possible with the small number of hands 
employed and perhaps the comparative scarcity of 
ice. I keep up a constant run of novelties by serv- 
ing two kinds at once in the same saucer or glass 
and making ices of almost every kind of sweet and 
fhiity material. In order to do this without mak- 
ing incongruous mixtures less acceptable than com- 
mon ice cream the greatest care and skill must be 
exercised both in compounding, coloring and foot- 
ing. Even if we make the o'.d foreign favorites 
they have to be supplied with plainer names for 
hotel bills of fare. Take for instance **tutti-fhitti;'* 
when the hotel keeper has ice cream provided he of 
course wants the guests to know it and get the good 
of it, but not one in a hundred of them that come to 
hotels knows what tutti-frutti is by that name, and 
much disappointment may be felt on that account. 
I would not be understood as advising the use 
of even the terms attached in this book to the sev- 
eral combinations. That is a matter of indiffer- 
ence. When you have two fancy ices at once, per- 
haps a pale green grape ioe and a deep colored 
frozen custard call it ice cream in the style of your 
hotel or of some other fi^mous one. In regard to 
the tutti-frutti receipt in the book it ought perhaps 
to be said that the outer coating of orange ice is 
not necessary for common dinners, it is an extra 
touch for a mold or bombe. This sort of frozen 
pudding can be dished out of )he freezer with or 
without a white ice like a frozen sauce at the side. 
The sense of some of these extras is never appar- 
ent until you have a table decorated with crystal, 
china and fiowers to supply. The best workmen 
after they have made the three creams or f^uit 
ices for Neapolitan and frozen them in brick- 
shaped or Neapolitan molds take them out a good 
while before dinner time, wrap each form after it 
is taken out of the mold in manilla paper and put 
them in a large Areezer well packed with ice and 
salt and keep them there frozen and dry until they 
are wanted. This saves hurry and melting by 
handling while dinner is going on. Line your 
brick molds with manilla paper, or at least the 
bottom and top, before putting in the ice cream. 
It is easier to take the cream out and also makes 
the lids fit tighter. 



Bread. — A good deal of wholesome enthusiasm 
has been evoked by the contents of the *'book of 
breads;'* the slight drawback has been that those 
who followed out the proper method of wominjg 
the dough have been surprised by their bread be- 
coming too light; that is of being ready to bake 



THB AKEBIOAN PA8TBT COOK. 



before thej believed it could be and before they 
were ready for it. It ie stated in the directions 
that under proper methods the dough needs no 
coaxing, no setting under the stoTe, it will rise al- 
most anywhere. A hint may be taken from the 
management of Vienna bread, the dough for which 
is made light once, then well kneaded, made into 
loaTes, cut across t'ae tops and baked very soon 
after without being allowed to get much proof or 
rising in the loaf shape. It is put into an oven 
that is Tery hot at first but bui t with a low roof so 
that the bread crowded in fills the OTen with steam 
in which the baking is finished. Ovens not spe- 
cially built for Vienna bread have a steam pipe 
leading into the oven to serve the same purpose, 
and rotary ovens have wet bricks thrown into the 
fire to fill the oven with steam. However interest- 
ing the subject it will generally be found too much 
trouble to make stock yeast in very small houses, 
but a starting may be obtained from some 
friendly baker or else dry yeast cakes must be 
used to start the ferment. An attempt to do too 
much is very apt to end in weariness. But al^ 
pastry cooks ought to make stock sometimes, to 
keep in practice, even if they are using the com- 
pressed in a regular way. 

Attention is particularly called to the method 
in this book of taking a piece of light dough from 
the rolls or bread to make various light fancy 
breads, muffins, waffles and the like. It not only 
makes the directions short and plain but makes it 
easy to turn out a great variety with but little ex- 
tra trouble over common bread. One setting of 
sponge does for everything. 

Plain Covered Piee— It has happened sev- 
eral times during the introduction of the first 
edition that I have had to hear unfavorable com- 
ments upon the pies and pastries of some gener- 
ally good workmen, in the form of a hope by the 
steward, clerk, or proprietor, as the case has hap- 
pened to be, that the book would give them a bint 
to make the old fashioned covered pies, and not 
the heavy and greasy ones they were making. It 
is much to be feared that our book has fal'en short 
of its duty in this particular; still it has been said 
over and over that puff paste is not good unless it 
is perfect or nearly so. Some kitchens and pastry 
rooms are so hot it is Impossible to make fine paste 
in them, and, after all, the greater number of peo- 
ple are as well or better pleased with good short 
paste. Take two cups of lard to seven cups of 
flour — or a pound of shortening to two pounds of 
flour and a little salt and rub them together dry, 
wet them with ice water, mix up and give the 
lump of paste two or three rollings in order to 
make it flaky. The same sort of paste but more 
orisp and dry can be made with suet chopped ex- 
tremely fine, weighing or otherwise making sure 



that you have enough. But when suet Is used it 
will be found best to mix up with water slightly warm 
that the suet may be soft enough to spread and be 
flaky under the rolling-pin, and then let the paste 
stand in a cold place until wanted. Good cooking 
apples and other pie Aruits can be put in the pie 
raw and a little sugar sprinkled over, then a top 
crust put on. These after all, are the real American 
pies; our open pies with fine high puff pa te edges 
are tourtes,flan9 and voU-auvent, 



Strawberry Shortoake.— Some dissatisfao- 
tionhas been expressed at the strawberry shortcake 
question being left in this book in an unsettled 
condition. But it is a fact as everybody knows 
that when strawberries first come in all the con* 
fectioners* windows display different kinds of straw' 
berry shortcake that are anything but the true ar' 
tide, being sometimes squares of sweet cake with 
strawberries on top and whipped white of egg 
on that — as little like the proper thing as it possi- 
bly can be. I have no hesitation now in saying 
these are all wrong and the only genuine article is 
made as I was schooled Jut j making it myself years 
ago by the wife of the present Secretary of the In. 
terior, one of the most critical judges of cookery, 
as she is herself one of the most accomplished 
cooks among all the ladies in the land. 

Make the short paste as directed in the preced- 
ing note for covered pies, only using fresh butter 
to rub in the flour instead of lard. Roll out nearly 
as thic'i as for biscuits, place on jelly cake pans 
and bake. Cover the strawberries with powdered 
sugar In a bowl and shake them up to mix. Split 
the short cake, spread strawberries on both halves 
and place one on top of the other. There will be 
strawberries, of course, on top as well as between. 
Serve a pitcher of cold sweet cream at the side. 
There should not be baking powder or any other 
sort of rising in this cake but the cold butter alone, 
which makes it light enough. 



Oity and Ck>untry Pastry Oooks.— Hav- 
ing paid attention in the foregoing notes to some 
things that they in the front of the house have said, 
it is in turn to mention that some pastry cooks 
claim that it takes a much smarter man to l*ea first- 
class pastry cook or meat cook either in a country bo. 
lel or a hotel in any small city than it does in a per- 
fectly fitted-up great house in New York or Chica- 
go. It is argued with perfect justice that in these 
great establishments one man does but one set of 
duties within certain hours and has everything 
properly ada; ted for his use,and such a one could not 
begin to do as well as the general pastry cook in 
the ordinary hotels of small cities does with all the 
deficiencies and disadvantages he has to con\end 
with. This thing properly considered by employ- 
ers would often save them the disappointmenta 



THE AMEBZOAK PASTBT COOK. 



they ezperienoe when, thinkiDC they will be made 
up and get their worl^ done ngbt, they send for a 
pastry oook from the big city and find that he 
either cannot or will not try to get along when 
they have got him. The young men that have 
learned and practiced only one department of hotei 
cooking are not the ones that give satisfaction in 
small houses. The pastry cooks of these houses 
have to invent their own ways, and learn to do 
iiplendid work under conditions that would make 
the others afraid to take hold and try. On account 
of his thus becoming used to adapting himself to 
the place, the oven, and the uiensils the chances 
are much better for getting a great variety of flrst- 
class pastry work from an active, interested, gen- 
eral pastry cook who has learned in hotels of med- 
ium size than from those under the steady routine 
of the great caravansaries Hotel keepers should 
encpurage the training of pastry cooks in their 
own ways in their own houses, as there are no 
other places for them to learn general work in. 

About Ovens. — Brick ovens are indisputably 
the best for hotels, yet, because they are not very 
often met with, when one is put in, the pastry 
cook who has been used to baking in a portable 
sheet iron oven or a range or stove, finds it awk- 
ward to begin the new way. Good pie baking can 
be done in the portable ovens for they will bake on 
the bottom, and good use can be made of the top of 
the fire box to boil jelly and stew fruit when room 
on the range is not to be had, but still they are 
very imperfect; they scorch the bread on one side, 
they are entirely unsuitable for baking cake and 
will not keep anything hot without drying the bot- 
tom and sweating the top. There is an immense 
number of them in use, although many pastry 
cooks and bakers will not work with them at all. 
The same money that buys them would build a 
brick oven. Every town has one or more bricklayers 
or builders who can build an oven, and some have 
a specialty in that line. It will cost from forty or 
fifty dollars upwards to a hundred and fifty or 
more for an ordinary oven. The patent rotary 
ovens run ftrom five hundred to fifteen hundred 
dollars. They are for the largest establishments. 
The floor rotates over the fire, the heat comes up 
through a hole or hub in the center and around the 
circumference, the door is rarely closed but the ar- 
ticles put in as the bottom passes the door are car. 
ried around and, if small, when they come to the 
door again they are done. Revolving ovens carry 
the shelves and pans up and down, baking all over 
alike. Common ovens are of two patterns. The 
simplest and cheapest has no furnace but the fire is 
made in the oven itself, on the floor, and when hot 
enough the oven is raked out and mopped clean 
and the articles put in. Only one heat at a time 
can be had and the things that need the most heat 



go in first, then the bread, after that the cakes. 
The other sort has a furnace at the side, the heat 
goes into the oven on its way to the chimney hole 
in the top. It may be known when the oven is hot 
and where the cool corners are by the smoke that 
blackens it all over when the fire is first made but ' 
disappears and leaves the bricks white when they 
are hot. When you have an oven built be careful 
to stipulate for a good bed of sand under the tile 
bottom. It holds heat and is essential to the mak- 
ing of a good oven. After a few days practice one 
who has not been used to an oven learns how long 
before it is wanted the fire must be started to heat 
it, and learns by the feel and by the appearance of 
the inside when it is at the right heat for any pur- 
pose. 



Jelly Boll — On account of the common diffi- 
culty of getting blank paper to use I have done my 
part towards abolishing the need of it by baking 
sheets of Hponge on baking pans without paper. 
Very few, however, can manage it quickly enough 
and the cake dries and breaks. Newspapers can 
not be used for the purpose because they are apt 
to leave the news of the day impressed on the cake 
in printing ink. Either thin manilla or blank news 
paper should be fiimished to the pastry room. 



By Welffht and Measure.— It pays to have 
scales and be exact. The pastry cook does not 
want the pudding to come out soft and slop ove^ 
the saucers, nor the lemon pie to be soft and run 
off the crust, so he throws in a lot more eggs if he 
cooks by guess, because he knows they'will cook 
solid and dry it up. Or, he wants another pud- 
ding to be soft and mellow and he throws in a lot 
more butter, knowing that will prevent it being 
dry and tough. But in most oases the extra eggs 
used only to make sure of a doubt do more harm 
than good, and the softness, like custard, that is 
wanted can be produced better by adding water or 
milk than by butter. The whole course of guess 
work cooking is full of errors. The objection that 
ireighing takes up too much time must be met by 
placing scales and weights in a position where they 
are always ready for instant use, on a little shel^ 
nailed up about breast high at the back or end o^ 
the pastry table. Ppring balances are of no use be. 
cause they will not weigh by ounces. Common 
scales with common iron weights are by all odds 
the best, for graded beams take too much attention 
to find small quantities. The scales onee placed in 
easy reach there is nothing more needed to be done 
to get them into use, for the pastry cook is too glad 
to have ''a dead sure thing" on whatever he does, 
and no failures, to neglect the weighing that is 
made easy. There are certain proportions of ingred. 
ients in every article that make it so good it is im- 
possible for it to be made any better — even In common

Oup and Spoon Measure. 

Cooks who go to plaoes where there are no soales' 
to use will find the following table asefol. 

A oup^Means the common sise of white eoifee 
oup generally used in hotels, that holds half a 
pint. 

Watkr — "A pint is a pound all the world round'* 
and the standard. A eup being ^ pint is therefore 8 
ounces. 

Milk, Tinegar and most fluids same as water. 

MoLASsss — A cup holds 12 ounces a basting 
spoon 2 ounoes. Thin syrups do not weigh so 
heavy. 

Eoos — A oup of eggs broken is the same ac 6 

YoLKS—A oup holds 18 yolka-^ pound. 

yfums—A oup holds 9 whites—} pound. 

Whole loos — 10 average a pound. When you 
have a bowl of yolks or whites left over weigh or 
measure and you will know how many there are. 

BuTTxa — A oup of butter is 7} ounoes if pressed 
in solid. It is near enough generally to call 2 cups 
butter a pound, either pressed in or melted. 

Laud — Same as butter. 

Suet — Minced suet a cup is 4 ounoes. 

Chocolate — Orated cold chocolate a oup is 8 
ounces. 

SuoAB^—A level cup of granulated sugar is 7 
ounoes. Although sugar by the grain is heavier 
than water the air spaces make it measure lighter. 
A rounded cup is i pound Fine icing sugar a eup 
is but 6 ounoes, dry yellow the same. All the 
sugar that can be scooped up out of a barrel with a 
oup weighs 9 ounces. 

Bbsad Ckumb8->A eup of bread pressed in rath- 
er solid is 4 ounces. A pound is a pressed-in quart 

Flour — A level cup of flour is 4 ounces. A cup 
heaped up with all that can be dipped with it out 
of a barrel weighs 7 ounces, nearly twice the level 
Aill. A quart of flour Just rounded oyer is a pound. 

Co&N-MBAL — ^A cup of oom-meal is 6 ounces, 8 



rounded cups are a pound. A pound is a little less 
than a level quart. 

OATMSAir~>A level eup is 6 ounoes. All that can 
be dipped up with a oup weighs 7 ounces — ^nearly } 
pound. 8 cups water cooks 1 oup oatmeal. 

Rice — A level eup weighs 7 ounces. All that 
can be heaped in a cup weighs 9 ounoes. 8 cups 
water cooks 1 cup rioe. 

CoBN STABOH — ^A lovcl cup of oookiug staToh is 6 
ounces. All that can be heaped in a cup weighs 7 
ounces. 4 cups milk oooks 1 oup staroh. 

Fa&ina — Same as starch. 

Tapioca — Same as rioe. 

Light bkead douoh — A rounded oup of dough 
weighs from 6 to 8 ounoes according to lightness — 
8 cups are a pound. 1 pound makes 10 or 12 rolls- 

Raisibs^^A heaped oup without stems is 8 ounces. 
A pound without stems about fills a quart. 

CuRBABTB — ^A heaped oup dry weighs 6 ounces 

Gboubd ootfeb — A heaping oup is 4 ouneee — it 
makes 2 quarts of ooifee. 

Tea — A heaping cup is 2 ounoes — ^it makes 4 
quarts of tea. 

Otstbbs — A oup holds a doien selects or 2 doien 
small. 

A BASTiHChSPOON — 8ix bastlug-spoous of liquid 
fill a oup. It holds about 1} ounoes of melted but- 
ter or lard, same as siie of an egg, and 2 ounoes of 
thick molassess. 

A TABLE-SPOON — 14 tlmes quite ftill is a cup or } 
pint. 2 tablespoons butter is 1 ounce, melted. A 
heaping tablespoon of sugar is 1 ounce, 6 or 7 fill a 
cup. A heaping tablespoon of starch is 1 ounce, 4 
will fill a cup — starch can be heaped so much high 
er than sugar. A moderately heaped tablespoon of 
flour is 1 ounce, 8 will fill a cup if fully heaped. 

A TEA-SPOON — Is } a tablespoon. It is near 
enough in most cases to call a teaspoonful } ounce 
of dry articles rounded up, not including ground 
coffee or tea. 

Apples — 4 average a pound — they lose a third 
by paring. 

BuTTEB - Sise of an egg is anything ftrom 1 to 2 
ounces. 

There are 16 cups in a gallon. 

A common wooden pail holds 2} gallons or 10 
quarts or 40 cups. 



BisguEloB Cbbams — Sometimes called biscuit ices 
in bilid of fare are those which have a paste o^ 
fruit or nuts mixed with the cream. Bisque of 
pineapple !» one of the favorite varieties, the 
directions for making it are at Nos. 107 and 93- 
Another example is the bisque of nuts of any 
^ind at No. 96, and preserved or candied ginger 



makes another. There should be bits of the 
minced fruit found in the ice to show what it is, 
and that it is not merely flavored. 

Italian bisque has lady- fingers crumbled and 
moistened in wine, mixed in ice cream the same 
way. Nesseirode Ice Pudding and Diplomatic Ice 
Pudding will be found at Nos. 689 and 690. 



NOTES TO THE FOURTH EDITION. 



Tortillas. — It would be most gratifying to me 
if these books should grow to be so comprehen- 
sively American as to include the best of the 
cookery of all the various peoples on the conti- 
nent To learn aU that is charcteristic in the 
cookery of Mexico without departing from my 
rule of never putting anything into a book that I 
had not previously performed myself by the 
measures and directions given I should have to 
go through the experience of a correspondent, a 
former Chicago chef, and visit the principal cities 
of that country. He says: 

"In looking over your American Pastry 
Cook I particularly noticed No. 626 (Tortillas) 
which I find is a mistake. I have spent the past 
two years in Old Mexico, most of the time as 
proprietor of the Eating House at San Juan del 
Rio, about 125 miles from the City of Mexico, 
and have seen Tortillas made in all the principal 
cities in Mexico and at no place do they use com 
meal or boiling water, as there is not, nor never 
has been, such a thing as com meal in Mexico, 
only such as came from the United States to 
Americans located there. The way they do make 
Tortillas is as follows : Corn is soaked in water 
34 hours, then it is laid on a rock and rubbed 
with another rock shaped something like a rolling 
pin till it forms a paste, then it is made into flat 
cakes like a hotel pancake, only thin as a wafer, 
which are made by being patted between the 
hands to the proper size, then are baked on hot 
coals. As a proof of the above recipe I refer you 
to any one in Mexico." 

My friend " Al " Rutherford is right, of course. 
Still my Mexican said just what is printed about 
him. Knowing that a tortilla is a corn cake, he 
was content to call a corn cake a toriilla without 
caring much about the di£Eerent method of mak- 
ing. Here is a still more particular description 
written by Fannie Brigham Ward to the Spring- 
field Republican : 

** A Mexican kitchen is a study, and to do it 
and all Its queer uiensils justice would require a 
column's space. There are no cooking stoves in 
Mexico, or even anything like ^he fire-places of 
our grandmothers' days. One side of the room 
was occupied by a sort of shelf, built into the 
wall, about breasi* high, in the center of which a 
small wood fire if^ kept burning. 

" There is no wood here which a New England 
housewife would consider fit to burn— only the 



gnarled and twisted branches of mountain trees, 
and around a little heap of these the earthen 
cooking pots are ranged. If the family is small, 
sometimes this smoky process is improved upon 
by building a charcoal fire in a large earthen pot 
and setting the smaller cooking vessels within it. 
In many houses a mud oven Is built at one end of 
this shelf, or somewhere out of doors. To heat 
the oven a fire must be built inside of It, and the 
entrance closed with a hot stone. However, as 
baked food—* pies an' things,' according to the 
Englishman's advertisement — enter not into the 
household economy, an oven Is altogether a super- 
fluous luxury. 

<* In the center of the kitchen stands its most im- 
portant factor, the metate, for tortilla-making. It 
is a hollowed stone, the size of an ordinary bread 
bowl, having two stone legs, about six inches 
high, at one end, which inclines it at an angle of 
45 degrees. The tortilla-maker kneels on the dirt 
floor at the elevated end of the metate, and, the 
com having been previously boiled in weak lye, 
and still quite wet, she crushes It into paste with 
a stone rolling-pin, the mixture gradually sliding 
down the inclined plane into a dish placed to re- 
ceive it When a quantity has been thus cnished, 
it is rolled into balls and left until required. It Is 
astonishing what an amount of com a family of 
srdinary size will consume in a day, in the form 
of tortillas, the Mexican * staff of life.' 

** When a meal is on the tapis, the last act in the 
drama — the tragedy, we feel inclined to say, 
when suffering the after pangs of indigestion — is 
to heat the griddle, or more commonly a smooth 
flat* stone. Then the cook takes a very small 
lump at once of the prepared corn paste and 
shapes it into thin round cakes, with a little water 
and much loud spatting of the hands, with a 
sound exactly like spanking babies. The cakes 
are then baked brown in a jiffy> and, as a substi- 
tute for bread, one might go further and fare a 
grreat deal worse than subsist on tortillas. 

" Whatever else American housekeepers may 
find worthy of imitation in Mexican methods, I 
am sure that dish- washing, as that disagreeable 
duty is practiced here, will not be one of them. 
The Mexican dish-washer does not bother with a 
table and thereby saves her arms from scrubbing 
and her legs from standing — but seats herself 
serenely on the floor beside a pail of hot or cold 
water. She has no soap, but a little sliced amoSa

root makes a strong ■- and cleaner suds, and in 
lieu of a dishcloth she ases a tiny broom-brush 
like our smallest whisk brushes. 

** The only disagreeable suggestion about it is 
that these dish brooms are exactly like those used 
to brush hair— from the *head of the family' 
down to that of the humblest criado (there are 
few combs used in Mexico) — and the fear will in- 
trude that those brooms may sometimes get 
* mixed,' like Buttercup's babies! The dishes 
are never ^\iped, but are turned up to dry, some- 
times in a tray or on an adobe shelf, but generally 
on the hard dirt floor leaned against the wall. 
Strange to say they always come to the table clean 
and shining. The brass spoons and steel -bladed 
knives are kept bright enough to see your face 
in, though no bath -bricks or patent soaps are em- 
ployed in their polishing — nothing but pure un- 
adulterated dirt The servant, whose duty it is> 
takes them out of doors, kneels upon the ground, 
dips up a little fresh earth, and, holding the knife 
or spoon firmly on a stone, polishes at her leisure. 
Despite dirt floors and the absence of all those 
conveniences which we consider indispensable, I 
have never yet seen an untidy kitchen in Mexico. 
Everything is kept as bright and fresh as hands 
and amole can make it, even to the cooking pot- 
tery, which is of necessity smoked black when- 
ever used. If we could combine their innate 
neatness with our improved methods the result 
would be that cleanliness which we are told is 
<akin to godliness.*" 

A CORRESPONDENT having experience of life 
in Mexican hotels says the first thing to be done 
while there, according to the custom of the coun- 
try, is to "take" coffee — and if by any series of 
howls and poundings you can attract the atten- 
tion of a servant, there being no bells, the uni- 
versal light morning repast, called desaguno, will 
be served in your room without extra charge. 
Nothing more substantial can be had "for love 
or money" before noon. It consists of a small 
loaf of Mexican bread (resembling a cannon ball), 
minus butter, accompanied by only a small cup 
of coffee or chocolate. Should you be so un- 
reasonable as to require a couple of eggs, they 
may be obtained for a small consideration from 
the astonished host, who marvels within himself 
at the greediness of ** Los Americanos." 



that the foreigners would not recognize it The 
real Turkish sherbet is nothing but fruit juice 
and water, only mixed with sugar when the acid- 
ity af the fruit makes it requisite. Turldsh lemon 
sherbet is simply lemonade, and all other fruits 
are used in the same way. What we call water- 
ices are the real sherbets frozen ; both names are 
proper for them and there is no room for a dis- 
pute. On the other hand the French apply the 
name sorbet to sherbets which have liquors added 
to them; sorbet an kirsk is kirschwasser punch 
frozen and so on through the list of punches. It 
is easy therefore to find authority for almost any- 
thing in this line of goods with changeable names* 
for there is no ultimate authority at present to 
refer to. The popular understanding of the 
meaning of a term establishes it in each different 
country. 

Ice Cups and Compound Ices.-— The many 
friends who have assured me that they found this 
book a perfect mine of good things will not now, 
I am sure, suspect me of undue egotism, when I 
assert that a number of the compound ices have 
never been surpassed in points of luxury or orna- 
ment, and, if used in connection with the ice cups 
No. 1 18, they afford specialties for any occasion 
of which any one may be proud. These ice cups 
have been adopted by some experts in London, 
as a new thing and a few bills of fare of fine hotels 
in this country have "ice cups" called by the 
name of the hotel. I wish all my readers to get 
the full benefit of all the recipes that have been 
perfected for them with an amount of experi- 
mental labor that might seem to them incredible 
if told. 



Sherbets. — In regard to disputes, which spring 
up touching the propriety of the names of certain 
compounds it is necessary to take into considera- 
tion that the English, French, and Americans, 
too, have in many cases taken up a foreign name 
and applied to something slightly like the foreign 
original, but so changed to suit their own fancies 



Cooking in the Mountains.— When I first 
went to work in a very elevated town in the 
Rocky Mountains, at over 10,000 feet above sea 
level. I shared in the common surprise and per- 
plexity of all novices in that region of finding that 
many old recipes wouldn't work and times and du- 
rations of cooking processes were somehow disar- 
ranged. Without wishing to encourage the telling 
of marvelous stories about small variations, it has 
to be conceded that it is more difficult to cook vege- 
tables well done and to boil beef tender there 
than at the common levels and the most difficulty 
was found in making good cake. All the cus- 
tomary cake mixtures were too rich, they were 
all too light and after rising too much in the oven 
the cakes invariably went down again, dark and 
sticky, some of the cakes directed to be made 
with ammonia or baking powder or with whipped 
whites of eggs to make them light, would rise 
and run over, but if those raising materials were 
left out the cakes came out just right and light

enough. Still that did not meet the difficulty in 
many cases. People to whom I tell it, but who 
have never experimented for themselves, do not 
want 1o believe that it was the sugar that needed 
to be changed in proportions — ^they will stiffen 
the cake with more flour or reduce the butter or 
eggs. But after testing it thoroughly I found that 
by leaving out a quarter of the sugar, good cake 
could be made at the highest point inhabited by 
man. The cakes were not as sweet and rich, of 
course, as if made by the full pound recipes, but 
they could be relied upon to be good in all other 
respects. Most of the cake recipes in this book 
are constructed on the knowledge that sugar in 
excess causes the most failures in cake baking 
and fourteen ounces are named instead of a pound. 
But at the level of the sea the full pound can be 
used, if wished. It is useful to know which of 
the ingredients causes the trouble when there 
•« any. 

Gauffres, Waffles and Wafer Caisses.— In 
reply to requests for further information about 
the copper patty case frier shown on page 59: It 
should be bent over so as to hang on the edge of 
the saucepan of lard and rest there without hold- 
ing. The copper head need not be solid, but is 
better if hollow. At the New Orleans Exposi- 
tion some waffle bakers had a booth where they 
fried a crisp sort of waffle or wafer, as is described 
on page 59 for cases, having their waffle irons or 
coppers as large around as a saucer, shaped indeed 
like a round border mould such as is shown on 
page 76, and having long handles bent over to 
rest on the edge of the frying kettle. They dipped 
the irons in cake batter, let them fry in hot fat 
and took off the wafer when done and dusted it 
with powdered sugar. The price they put upon 
their waffle irons was $15 per pair, but offered to 
sell to hotels at $ia It is not known how low 
they would really have sold them, if anybody 
had really wanted to buy. The cook who cannot 
obtain these utensils can get along very well for 
small caisses by merely dipping common tin patty 
pans of any shape in batter — the outsides only — 
dropping them in a kettle of hot lard and letting 
fry till light brown and crisp. Take off the shell 
of batter and dip the patty pans again. 



New Pudding. Material.— Cerealine is a new 
starchy substance made of Indian com. A strong 
effort has been made to introduce it to general 
use, and much money spent in advertising, but 
with doubtful success. The article is good, but 
so much like com starch and so little better than 
any of the other pudding materials that nobody 
feels the need of it It is, in the packages, pre- 
cisely like the white mealy part of popped corn. 
It cooks quickly like starch, and can be used in 
the same way as starch, farina and com meaL 
Manioca is another article, not new, yet but little 
known, which is one of the most desirable pud- 
ding materials. It is a fine tapioca, and not fine 
rice, and makes the most delicate of puddings 
used ia the same manner as sago and pearl ta- 
pioca. 

A FEW corrections and subttitutions of new 
or improved recipes for old ones have been made 
for this edition. I have been careful, however, not 
to change or disturb any of the special features of 
the book, which have been the means of bringing 
me so many kind and enthusiastic letters. 

An InTitation. — All cooks, pastry cooks, con- 
fectioners and bakers who execute ornamental 
pieces, which they would like to preserve in a 
picture, are respectfully invited to send photo- 
g^phs of them to me to be engraved and inserted 
in the next edition of whichever of these books 
shall be reissued first thereafter. My latest pub« 
lished book, ** Cooking for Profit," contains a de* 
partment for artistic cookery in which are pictures 
of two prize pieces, one of which took the first prize 
at the French Cooks' Exhibition in Paris, the other 
won a gold medal in London. It seems unfor- 
tunate that of all the fine pieces exhibited by the 
cooks at their annual banquets in New York and 
other cities, and of all the elaborate work done 
for public and private parties so little is ever seen 
by those outside who could best appreciate its ar* 
tistic merits. It is earnestly desired that a collec* 
tion of pictures of such work may be made, and 
as new issues of these books are made at least 
once a year, it affords an opportunity to the artists 
to place their work in a permanent form to be a 
source of interest to many readers and of pride 
to themselves. J, W. 



The Scotch Haggis.— We are indebted to Mrs. 
Black, of the Glasgow School of Cookery, for the 
following, which may be considered an authentic 
recipe for the famous Caledonian dish: 

One sheep^s p'mck, a sheep's stomach, % lb. 
tuet, z onion, ^ lb. oatmeal, pepper and salt 
Procure a sheeps pluck and stomach-bag; wash 
the pluck well, and put it on in a pot to boll, 
allowing the windpipe to hang out ol the pot so 



that any impurities will come out by it, boU 
gently from one and a half to two hours. Get 
the stomach bag nicely cleaned by the butcher; 
wash it thoroughly in cold water -and bring it to 
the boil, which will cause the bag to contract. 
Take it out of the pot immediately, wash and 
scrape it well, and lay it in the salt and water un- 
til needed. Mince the best part of the lungs and 
the heart, leaving out all gristly parts; grate the

best parts of the liver, and put all in a large basin. 
Toast well the oatmeal, and add it to the contents 
of the basin. Chop the suet very finely, add a 
middling-sized onion very finely chopped up, two 
teaspoonsful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper, a 
breakfast cup of the liquor in which the pluck 
was boiled, to moisten, and mix the whole. Now 
take up the stomach-bag, keep the fat or smooth 
side inside, and fill it up, but not quite full ; sew 
up the opening, and put it in boiling water to boil 
gently for three hours. Prick the haggis several 
times with a darning-needle to prevent it from 
sticking to the bottom of the pot 



Wanted a Sobotitate.— A man in B>>, Ills., 
said recently that he would pay me a hundred 
and fifty dollars if I could show him how to 
make ice cream without using cream that 
would be as good as real cream and that would 
beat up as well. He did not make the offer to 
me direct, but a young man from Iowa, a 
strong partizan of my books, who told him that 
he could get the information in the American 
Pastry Cook at a much lower price. The man 
of B — did not want it that way, however, but 
wanted to pay a hundred and fifty dollars for 
some reason or other, and my young man ought 
to have been bolder, stayed with him, shown 
him how and collected the money on the spot, 
but he hesitated and referred the matter to me. 
Undoubtedly, the B— man is quite right. He is 
in the ice cream business, and the knowledge 
he seeks will be worth a hundred and fifty 
dollars, and he ought to pay it, and if he is a 
man of his word, after he has read this article 
and tried my directions, he may please send 
his hundred and fifty dollars right straight to 
the ofiice, where I will duly acknowledge the 
receipt with the customary thanks and a hope 
to receive further favors. 

It will be supposed that a man, who is anx- 
ious to pay a hundred and fifty dollars for a 
substitute for cream, has no motive but to use 
a cheap imitation instead of the dearer genuine 
article, but as he is to pay me such a respect- 
able fee he shall be defended against such an 
imputation. He cannot get enough real cream 
for the requirements of his business; what he 
does get, is not uniformly good; some of it is 
just on the point of turning sour when it comes; 
some, having been kept too long, has a flavor 
of mouldiness; the larger portion is so thin that 
he can hardly tell it from new milk. This is 
always the way with the products of nature, 
they lack uniformity, they are subject to great 
variations of quality and appearance; on the 
other hand, the products of art are always un- 



der control of the artist, who can make them 
always alike or vary them at pleasure. Cooks 
can make artificial cream, therefore they are 
artists. The B — man wants to be an artist, and 
offers a hundred and fifty dollars. Besides that, 
to freeze real cream is the lazy man*s way ; any- 
body can pour pure eream cold into the freezer 
(if they can only get the cream) with the requi- 
site amount of sugar and flavoring, and freeze 
it with such ease as to hardly miss the time ; 
but to make artificial cream requires one to be 
industrious, and industry is always praise- 
worthy ; the B— man wants to know the in- 
dustrious way, and says he will pay a hundred 
and fifty dollars, here it is: 

To make 4 gallons of artificial cream, which 
will be 6 gallons of ice cream after freezing, 
Uke 

4 gallons of new milk. 

7 pounds of granulated sugar. 

y pound of corn starch. 

24 yolks of eggs. 

Set half the milk over the fire to boil with all 
the sugar in it. Mix the starch in a pan with a 
quart of the remaining cold milk, then drop in 
the raw yoiks and beat to mix. When the milk 
on the fire boils, pour about a quart of it into 
the starch and egg mixture, then turn these 
into the boiling milk and at once remove the 
kettle from the fire, for the heat is sufficient to 
cook the starch and eggs. Add the cold milk 
and strain into the freezer. 

It is required that our artificial cream shall 
beat up as well as real cream, that is, become 
light and foamy, increase in volume and fill the 
freezer. This it will do perfectly, when only 
lightly cooked, as above directed. The boiling 
milk cooks the starch and half cooks the yolks 
so that they beat up by the motion of the 
freezer as light as sponge cake. But to beat up 
this or any other cream requires rapid motion. 
It is most perfect where the freezer is run by 
steam power, otherwise the old fashioned 
paddle should be used to finish, and when the 
artificial cream is so beaten up light, it canno( 
be known from real cream, that Is from goou 
fresh cream that is neither sour or mouldy, and 
if the two are tried together it will generally 
receive the preference by the taste alone. If 
that is not enough, and something that will 
beat up better than cream be wanted, then take 
the whites of the eggs, beat them up stiff when 
the cream is nearly frozen and mix them in, 
and continue beating and freezing and the 
cream will raise the lid presently and foam all 
over. Please remit. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



To be Tried. — It has been imparted to rae as 
a secret worth knowing that a peculiarly deli- 
cious ice cream can be made of new milk which 
has rennet mixed with it, as if it were to be 
made into cheese, but it is not to be allowed to 
become thoroughly curdled. Somebody want- 
ing a specialty in ice cream should try it. 
Something about milk and rennet can be found 
in this book, in connection with English cheese 
cakes and cream curd puddings. 



About Prepared Almond Paste.— It is a pity 
to have to say it, but the ready-prepared almond 
paste, which can be bought in tin cans at about 
. 25 cents per pound and makes such delicious 
macaroons, almond icing and almond ice cream, 
has been unfavorably mentioned by the chem- 
ists as being adulterated with prussic acid, 
which is a poison. However, it is the same 
poisonous prussic acid which gives the flavor 
to such fruits as the peach, apricot, cherry 
and plum, its flavor is strongest in peach 
kernels, yet these are never known to injure 
anybody, the quantity of the drug being too 
small to have any hurtful effect; it is prussic 
acid which gives the bitter flavor to peach 
leaves, laurel leaves and the bay leaves, which 
are so much used for seasoning. Almond paste, 
if used at all, should be used sparingly and not 
with the' excess which some pastry cooks 
practice because they And almond ice cream is 
a great favorite. Buyers of almond paste should 
deal only with reputable manufacturers. It is 
made, when genuine, of a mixture of sweet and 
bitter almonds, and is not hurtful, but cannot 
be so low-priced as an imitation flavored with 
drugs. 

To Use Almond Paste, shave it off the lump 
thinly, mix the shavings with granulated sugar 
and roll them together on the slab or table un- 
til the paste is thoroughly divided amongst the 
sugar, then use the sugar to make what is 
wanted. 



Another Plum Padding. — ^This receipt makes 
one good-sized pudding: Take half a pound of 
breadcrumbs, half a pound of flour, half a pound 
of beef suet chopped very fine, two ounces of 
sweet almonds cut in fillets, one pound of cur- 
rants, one pound of raisins (stoned), eight 
ounces of lemon-peel cut in thin stripes, two 
ounces of citron-peel, four ounces of brown 
raw sugar, the zest and juice of one lemon ; mix 
well together with eight eggs and a wineglass 
of brandy ; boil six hours, and hang up in the 
larder till required ; then boil up again for two 
or three hours — an hour or two will in no way 



injure a good plum-pudding — and always serve 
very hot, with brandy or rum sauce, as the case 
may be. 

Bakers' Cheap Cop Cakes. 

4 pounds butter. 

6 pounds sugar. 
32 eggs. 

2 quarts milk. 

2 quarts water. 

4 ounces ammonia. 

13 pounds flour, or enough to make dough a 
little thinner than pound cake. Mix like 
pound cake, adding the milk and water after 
the eggs, and flour and ammonia or powder 
last. Weigh off three-ounce cakes in small 
moulds. 



Bakers' Lady Fingers. 

I pound sugar. 
10 eggs. 

I pound flour. 
Beat the eggs (not separated) and the sugar 
together for half ah hour, stir in the flour 
lightly. Directions for forming and baking 
will be found in this book. This is a harder, 
less delicate and more serviceable kind than 
the receipts in the following pages. 



Why these "Notes" are Written.— As fast 
as any new thing comes up or any old and well- 
known thing is newly found out to be specially 
good for hotel use, I try to get it into these 
books as new editions are being printed. The 
following letter will please some readers, and 
pleases me because it shows up what I have al- 
ways contended for, that it is better to have a 
few special good things that everybody likes 
than to have a hundred or thousand far-away, 
strange dishes that nobody appreciates; this 
friend wanted the one receipt for ♦* Popovers " 
worse than he wanted the whole book besides, 
and expense is no object when a man wants a 
specialty. This receipt can be found in Cooking' 
for Profit and in the new edition of the Family 
Cook Booky in one of which the man from Ohio 
had it and now it is in this volume, also.

crack open and are hollow in centre and brown

PopoTers, or German Poflb.— These puffs 
are among the culinary curiosities, as they have 
neither powder nor any other raising material 
in jthem, yet they rise high above the tops of 
the cups and become quite hollow — if not 
spoiled by too much flour. Good, rich milk 
should be used to make them. The batter may 
be kept an hour or two after mixing and little 
batches of puffs baked fresh as wanted, and the 
last will be as good as the first. 
3 eggs. 
I pint of milk — or 2 cups. 

10 ounces of flour — or two slightly rounded 
cups. 

Salt, a small teaspoonf ul. 

Break the eggs into a bowl, beat them light 
and keep adding the milk while beating. That 
takes about five minutes. Add the salt, then 
the flour all at once and beat it smooth like 
cream. 

Bake in cups or deep muffin pans well but- 
tered, and only half fill them with the batter. 
Bake in a moderate oven about half an hour. 



Sootch Slices.— This favorite kind of cake, 
and likewise "aniseed slices," "caraway slices" 
and other names given by different bakers, are 
all made of Scotch shortbread, as follows: 

1 pound of flour. 
^ pound of butter. 
^ pound of sugar. 

2 eggs. 

Rub the butter into the flour, stir the eggs in 
the sugar until it is partly dissolved, mix all to- 
gether. It makes dough that can be rolled out 
and will be a trifle lighter for not being kneaded 
too much. 

To make Scotch or caraway slices, mix in a 
tablesp^onful or two of caraway seeds, for ani- 
seed slices use aniseed, for German slices use 
coriander seed. Roll the dough into a long roll, 
place on the baking pan and flatten it down to 
about an inch thick, bake with a dredging of 
sugar on top. When baked, cut off slices as 



from a loaf and serve with other kinds in the 
cake baskets. 



L. E. B., Ogdensbux^, ¥rrltet: "Can you tell 
me what use to make of surplus yolks of eggs? 
You do not mention but one kind of cake made 
with yolks. I ' am employed in a fine bakery or 
confectionery, and some times have several quarts 
of yolks left over In a week and have to throw 
them away spoiled." 

Ana. If you were doing hotel work you would 
find, on the contrary, the whites would be left 
over, there being so many more uses lor the 
yolks. The yolk contains all the richness of the 
^S^ >uicl gives color, flavor and smoothness to 
puddings, cream custards and sweet sauces, better 
alone than with the whites mixed In. We use the 
yolks also in fish sauces, salad dressings, in potato 
and other croquettes, also minced lor an orna- 
mental garnish, mixed with flour for "noodles'* 
and with batter lor another kind of soup, also 
thicken soups with them. Instead of flour or 
starch, and steam yolks In bulk like a cake, then 
cut up and use them as we would chicken meat 
for patties. We rub cooked yolks through aaleve 
making a sort of vermicelli, to serve with some 
dish, and we drop them whole, also, Into soup to 
substitute turtle eggs. We cut them up and mix 
with chicken meat, mushroona and sauce to fill 
the shells of fried bread with, and If there are any 
raw yolks left over after that, we mix them in the 
wafl3e batter. In a good bakery you will find 
nearly as many uses for this the bc»t part of the 
egg, no matter how many may be left over, from 
your using the whites In meringues, macaroons, 
Icing, etc, for the yolks may be mixed with water 
and used the same as whole eggs. Take a pint 
measure about two-thirds full of yolks, fill it up 
with water and you iiave a pint of eggs, which Is 
a pound, or equal to ten eggs, and the mixture of 
yolks and water can be used In making almost 
any sort of cakes, the only difference observable 
being that they are yelloi^er and richer than If 
whole eggs are employed. In this way you can 
utilize the yolks In all sorts of small cakes. In 
French coffee cakes, buns, rusks, tea-cakes, and 
In the sorts of sponge cakes and jelly rolls which 
are made light with powder Instead of whipped 
whites. If you make Ice creams, they alone — 
that Is the fancy kinds— should use up all of that 
material you can have to spare, and another good 
purpose to put surplus egg-yolks to is to mix them 
with lemon or orange syrup and a little butter 
and stir the mixture over the fire until it thickens 
into a jam, very good to fill tartlets. If after that 
any yolks of eggs remain on hand, put them fai 
the lemon and pumpkin pies.

The American Pastry Cook. 



L Anffel Food, or White Sponffe Oake. 

11 whites of eggs. 

10 ounces of fine granulated sugar — all that can 
be shaken and heaped on a cup. 

6 ounces of flour — a cup moderately heaped. 

2 rounded teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar. 

2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla or lemon extraet. 

Get two pans toj^ether, put the cream of tartar 
into the flour and mix them by sifting out of one 
pan Into the other six or seven times. 

Whip the whites firm enough to bear up an egg, 
put in the sugar, beat a few seconds, add the flay- 
oring, then stir in the flour lightly without beat- 
ing. When the flour is mixed in fairly out of sight 
it is finished. As soon as mixed put the cake in 
the oven. It needs'eareful baking like a meringue 
in a slack oven and should stay in from 20 to 80 
minutes. A deep smooth mold with an unusually 
large tube is (he best, but any other will do. The 
mold should not be greased, but when the cake is 
done turn it upside down, the tube or something 
else holding it up to let the air in, and leave it to 
get cold before trying to ta- e it out. Then cover it 
with the plain sugar glaze of the next receipt. 

The rule for angel food in large quantities is a 
pound of sugar, a pound of whites, half a pound of 
flour and an ounce of cream tartar. 



Angel food, as this peculiarly white and light 
sponge cake is fancifully named has quite a history 
to be recorded. ItoriginatedinSt Louis a few years 
ago and is seen oAener in the hotel bilh of fare of 
that city than anywhere else. S. Sides, who kept 
a large cafe or restaurant there invented it and did 
not fail to make the most of his discovery, and it 
soon came into such great demand that not only 
was no fine party supper complete without it but 
it was shipped to distant cities, orders coming even 
flrom London. For some time the method of mak- 
ing it was kept a profound secret but at length the 
inventor yielded so far as to sell the receipt for 
twenty-five dollars, having it understood that it 
. could not be made without a certain powder that 
could be obtained from him alone. It did not take 
long to discover that the powder was nothing but 
cream of tartar and the receipt once communicated 
gradually became common properly. Many of the 
caterers for parties maUe a specialty of it, for it is 
still sufficiently difficult to make always alike to 
prevent its becoming utterly common, and a con 
liderable number of the cnkes are sent out packed 



in boxes to surrounding towns, and occasionally to 
the east and south. The difficulty such as it is, 
that makes the caterers say this cake has been 
more trouble to them than anything else, and leads 
to the use of special molds to bake it in is the ten- 
dency to fall in at the centre after baking. The 
mold not being greased holds the cake up to its 
shape until cold. The lamb* s- wool texture of it 
may be made finer by stirring after the flour is ad- 
ded. The cake will be better when a day o'd than 
when first baked, but to keep the outside from dry- 
ing and to make it better eating, as it has no rich- 
ness in its ingredients, it is always covered with a 
flavored sugar glaxe or icing. It may have no di- 
rect connection with u, but Sides, who originated 
angel food, afterwards lost his reason and was 
taken to an insane asylum, his wife continuing the 
business he established. 



2. Pearl Glaze for Aiurel Food, etc. 

1 cupful of icing sugar. 

2 whites of eggs 

2 teaspoonfuls of flavoring extract. 

Mix them together in a bowl. As soon as the 
sugar is fairly wetted it is ready but may be 
whitened by beating one minute. It dries pearl 
white; takes but a few minutes to prepare. Spread 
it over the bottom and sides of angel food. It also 
gives a rich transparent sort of eatable appearance 
to the top of a fine jelly cake, and shows up orna- 
ments of finished white icing finely. 

It does nearly as well with the sugar only slight- 
ly wetted with water instead of white of egg, when 
it is to be spread on pastry, as the sugar dries 
white. It can also be colored pink, or with choc- 
olate, or made yellow by mixing with yolk of egg. 

3. Eiffht-BfffiT SpoDire Oake. 

1 pound of fine granulated sugar~2 rounded 
cups. 

8 eggs. 

6 tablespoonfuls of water — small } cup. 

12 x>unce8 of flour— 8 rounded cups. 

Separate the eggs, the white into a bowl, the 
yolks into the mixing pan. Put the water and 
sugar in with the yolks and beat them ten minutesi 
until they are a thick light batter. Have the flour 
ready.- Whip the whites to a very firm froth, then 
mix the flour with the yolk mixture and stir the 
whites in last. Bake in molds either large or small 
Good for large and small sponge cakes and lady 
fingers.

White JeUy Soil. 



The angel food cake does not answer to roll up, 
but nearly the same ingredients put together in 
another way make a fine roll and also white cake 
lining for charlotte-russe. 
10 ounces of granulated sugar — a heaping cupful. 
12 ounces of whites of eggs — 13 whites. 

6 ounces of fl3ur — a heaping cupful. 

2 rounded teaspoonfuls cream of tartar. 

Vanilla or lemon extract. 

Put the sugar and white of eggs into a deep pan, 
pail or brass kettle and beat them together with the 
vire egg whisk for about 20 minutes. If beaten 
rapidly in a cool place the mixture will then be like 
good cake frosting. Then add the cream of tartar 
and flavoring and beat one minute longer, next, stir 
in the flour with a spoon. It should be baked im- 
mediately. Lay a sheet of blank paper on the 
largest baking pan, spread the cake only just thick 
enough to hide the paper, bake about six or eight 
minutes. Brush the paper over with water to get it 
off". Spread lemon or orange honey or red jelly on 
the cake and roll up.

Finest Ohocolate Oake. 



Melt 4 ounces of common chocolate by merely 
warming it in a cup set on the side of the range. 

Make the snow cake mixture preceding, flavor it 
strongly with vanilla, and leave out the brandy. 
Pour in the melted chocolate and beat it in just be- 
fore the milk. 



O. 



Finest Wine Oake. 



Make the snow cake mixture and leave out the 
milk. Instead of it mix in at the last nearly a small 
teacupful of madeira wine, with enough either of 
red strawberry sjrrup or of drops of carmine to make 
the cake couUur de rote^ but only pale blush or 
peach bloom, not any dull red or purples for cake. 
The lemon juice is very necessary here; it changes 
red to bright pink. 



lO. 



Marble Oake. 



Make either of the white cake mixtures, take out 
about half a cupful and color it light red with straw- 
berry or currant syrup. 

Butter a cake mould, flour it, and shake out the 
surplus flour, leaving the mould thinly coated. 
Drop lumps of cake batter in the mould with a tea- 
spoon, paint them over with a knife dipped in the 
red baiter, but without flattening or smoothing or 
running the lumps together. Drop more spoonfuls 
of the cake mixture in the hollows and paint them 
over with the knife blade dipped in red as before, 
and so fill the mould to within an inch of the top. 
There will be fine waving lines of pink through the 
cake wh^ cut. 

Chocolate and white can be used in the same way. 
The snow cake mixture is apt to be too soft to keep 
form by spoonfuls, unless quite cold. 

*' Luck " is the poorest possible ingredient in cake 
making. The same cause will always produce the 
same eflect. The exact proportions that will make 
a splendid cake one time will make the same every 
time if put together the same way. The question is 
only to find the right proportions.

Turkish Cake , 



Fine chocolate cake with figs, almonds and 
:.Jsins. The snow cake mixture will not bear up 
the fruit. Make the lady cake mixture, and add to 
It 4 ounces of chocolate melted by heat in a cup. 
Then prepare 

8 ounces of chopped figi. 

8 ounces of almonds blanched and split. 

8 ounces of seedless raisins. 

Flavor the prepared cake batter with vanilla and 
a little brandy. Dust the fruit with flour and stir it 
in. 

What makes us think the ladies cannot make deli- 
cate cakes, for sure, just when they want them is 
the exhibition they sometimes make at a church 
fair where everybody contributes cake with their 
names on. They look awful — ^like a cake hospital. 



19. 



Almond Cake. 



Make the lady cake mixture — the first receipt of 
this series — and add to it a pound of almonds 
blanched (scalded and peeled) and split. Also use 
almond extract and rote extract to flavor with. 
Dust the almonds with flour. The snow cake mix- 
ture would be too delicate to bear up the almonds. 



13. 



White Baiein Cake. 



Like the preceding, with a pound of sultan* 
seedless raisins instead of almonds, and flavor with 
lemon and extract of nutmegs. This is best baked 
in shallow pans in sheets; but of that more further 
on. 

And it is for these church fairs or other public 
festivals the dwellers in the world of private houses 
try to succeed and show their best, if ever, but they 
seem to always fail. 



14. 



Queen Cake 



Made with the lady cake mixture, No. 5, except 
the milk. 

1 pound of the greenest colored candied citron. 

i pound of almonds, blanched and split. 

i pound of sultana seedless raisins. 

i cup of sherry or maderia wine. 

The citron to be cut in fine shreds and floured to- 
gether with the almonds and raisins before mixing 
in. This mixture also makes small queen cakes, 
baked in little patty-pans, and these frosted on to|> 
are among the finest possible. 

It is at these times they make the master of the 
b^use buy a cord of hickory wood and hire a man to 
saw it, because it makes such a nice steady heat to 
bake a cake with; and they send a boy on a horse 



to a friend's in the country to get some "right 
fresh eggs," because there are none in the whole 
town good enough. Then they have Julia to dry 
the flour, and Betsey to wash and pound the butter, 
and Susan and her little sister to beat the eggs, and 
it is bad for the poor cat if she gets in the way. 
We fellows who live in bakeries don't positively 
know that these things take place, but have picked 
up such impressions someway. But we do know 
how the cakes look when they get to the fair.

Hickory Nut Cake. 



8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of whites of eggs (9 whites.) 

I cupful of milk. 

1 rounded teaspoonful of baking powder. 

1 pound of flour. 
12 ounces of hickory nut kernels. 

Don't beat the whites to a froth. Warm the but- 
ter and sugar together and rub them to a cream the 
usual way, then add the eggs, then milk, powder, 
and the flour. When well mixed stir in the hickory 
nuts. Flavorings may be added at option. If 
brandy be used the baking powder should be left 
out. 

lO. 

There is one cake marked "presented by Mrs, A.* 
It rose one-sided. The top cracked all over, looked 
like all splits and gullies, and in the high side a 
crater opened and the lava kept rising and running 
and never would get cooked and stop, though all the 
rest of the cake was done hard long ago, and began 
to smell unpleasantly. That cake was poor, had 
too little butter and too much eggs, milk and flour, 
and probably was not put into bake for some hours 
after the batter was mixed. There is anothei 
"presented by Miss B.'* It rose and rose, flat- 
topped and even, but never got above the edge of 
the cake mould. It leaked over the top and hung 
in strings, and fell on the stove bottom and made a 
smell, and when it got tired of that it just sunk 
down and down again. That had too much sugar. 



11. 



Dream Cake. 



In a city that we know of there is an entire 
side of a building in a fashionable neighborhood 
painted in large letters with the words "celebratei* 
dream cake.** Evidently it was the aim to rival 
the fame of *« angel food," and this is certainly 
better eating, although scarcely so extremely 
white. 

1 pound of granulated sugar — H cupb. 
}i pound of butter — 1 cup. 

12 whites of eggs — 1^ cup. 
}i pint of milk — 1 cup. 

2 rounded teaspoons baking powder.

THE AXBBXO±Lxn ar ASTBT COOK. 



1 rounded teaspoon cream tartar. 

Vanilla or lemon extract 

1 pound good weight of flour — 4 cupe. 

Sift the flour, powder and cream tartar together 
three or four times over. 

Soften the butter and stir it and the sugar to- 
gether until white and creamy, gradually stir in 
the milk, tepid, and a handful of flour to keep 
them from separating. Whip the whites to froth, 
and add part whites and part flour until all are in, 
and flavoring extract at same time. Bake either 
in cake moulds or shallow pans and frost over 
when done. 

Kossuth Cakes. 



Make sponge drops large and thick, hollow out 
the bottoms, put in whipped cream or pastry 
cream, place two together and with a fork dip 
them in melted sweet chocolate or chocolate icing 
and set on tins to dry. A specialty of Baltimore 
confectioners. SeH at about a dollar a dozen.

Ordinary White wake. 



1 pound of sugar. 
8 ounces of butter, melted. 
10 whites of eggs. 

1 cupful of milk. 

2 teaspoonfuU of baking powder, 
li pounds of flour. 

Beat the sugar, melted butter and whites all to- 
gether a minute or two, add the milk, powder, flour 
and flavor. 

Now, if we had to make cakes in some place 
where people took notice and made remarks and 
said we did not know much about making good 
things in hotels nohow, and if they couldn't do 
better they would sell out, we should want to make 
the snow cake as beautiful and white as cotton bat- 
ting, bake it thin in jelly cake pans, spread some of 
the richest confections between the cakes, and ice 
the top, having the cake and the icing so near alike 
in whiteness as to be hardly distinguishable apart. 



19. 



Pistacliio Oream Oake. 



8 ounces of pistachio nuts, blanched and chopped. 
8 ounces of sugar, 
i cupful of water. 

2 ounces of butter. 
Whites of four eggs. 

Green juice from pounded spinach leaves for color- 
ing. 

3 jelly cake sheets of snow cake: 

Boil the sugar and water to thick syrup, throw in 
the butter, then the pistachio nuts, boil five 
minutes; then stir in the white of eggs and take it 
off when they thicken. Color it a little deeper than 
pistachio green. Spread this when cold between 
the three sheets of cake. 



8 ounces of fresh grated cocoamit. 

1 pound of sugar. 
4 large oranges. 

2 lemons. 

4 ounces of butter. 

6 yolks and 2 whole eggs. 

Grate the rinds and squeeze the juice of the 
oranges and lemons into the sugar and bring it to a 
boil, making a flavored syrup. Throw in the but- 
ter, then the cocoanut, and boil 5 minutes. Stir in 
the eggs and cook slowly till thick. Spread between 
layers of snow cake. 

Then they are strange the way they exclaim when 
they burn up a cake in the stove. Once we heard 
a lady sing, "Gee woicks gee whilikens, the dor- 
drotted thing's gone blackernaniggerbaby i" That 
was at the toll house at Shippingsport near Louis- 
ville, as we were going through the locks twenty - 
seven years ago last anniversary, and anybody could 
know it was a cake burnt up by the black smell that 
came across the canal. Now one of us fellows 
would only have remarked dam kind of quietly and 
lighted our pipe. . In fact, you have to bake these 
white eake sheets with scarcely any color at all to 
look well with colored creams between and icing on 
top. 



91. 



Glazed Oakes. 



We use the term for cakes glazed over with boiled 
icings of diff'erent colors to make a distinction from 
the usual iced or frosted cakes with raw sugar 
icing. All the richness of cream candy bon-bons 
belongs to these; they are better to cut, better to 
look at and better to eat than the common, and 
after a very little practice are quicker made and dry 
immediately. 



HtHtm Yellow Glaze or Boiled Icing*. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

i teacupful^f water. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

Flavoring extracts. 

Boil the sugar and water, without stirring, for 5 
minutes or more, or till a drop of the syrup in cold 
water sets so that it can hardly be flattened between 
the finger and thumb. A deep bowl-shaped sauce- 
pan holding one quart should be used. Have the 
yolks slightly beaten ready in a bowl. Pour the 
bubbling syrup to the yolks quickly while you 
rapidly beat them with an egg beater. Return to 
the fire and keep stirring while it cooks a minute or 
two. It will then do to pour on sheets of cake and 
|f the syrup was at the right point it will set hard 
and dry as soon as cold. 



THB AKSBIOAN PASTBT COOK. 



11 



But it is better to finish by beating the glaze 
rapidly while it is cooling, and add the flayoring 
just as it becomes too thick to beat. 

The above is the easiest of the kind to niake, as it 
does not make so much difference what point the 
syrup is boiled to— it will dry on the cakes anyway. 



28. White Qlaze or Boiled Icing*. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

i teacupful of water. 

4 whites of eggs. 

Flavoring extracts. 

Boil the sugar and water to a point thicker than 
for the yellow glaie, or till the drop in cold water 
sets hard and brittle. After the first mixing of the 
sugar and water these syrups should never be 
stirred — makes them turn to sugar. Don't beat the 
whites any more than enough to mix them. Pour 
the bubbling sjrrup to the whites, beating all the 
while. Set on the fire again and beat for a minute 
or two while it cooks. It is extremely liable to 
bum on the bottom. 

Then set the saucepan in a pan of ice-water, and 
heat the icing with a Dover egg beater till it becomes 
thick. It will be of a dazzling whiteness at last. 
Can be flavored to suit the fancy. If boiled to right 
point sets hard as soon as spread or poured over the 
cake. 



94* Bose Qlaze or Boiled Zcing*. 

Make the white glaze and color and flavor to suit, 
just as it begins to be so thick as to be hard to beat. 



95* Chocolate Glaze or Boiled Icing:. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 
i teacupful of water. 

3 ounces of grated chocolate. — the common sort. 

4 whole eggs. 

Vanilla flavoring extract. 

Boil the sugar and water together in a deep sauce- 
pan for five minutes, add the chocolate. 

When a drop in cold water sets hard almost as 
candy stir in the eggs rapidly, beating all the while* 
Let cook about five minutes more with constant 
stirring.' Flavor with vanilla. Beat more or less 
while it is cooling. Spread or pour it over sheets of 
cake. 

The confectioners, too, like us to make these 
glaze cakes for their windows and show cases; they 
take pleasure when the cake is as white as the icing, 
and red jelly between the layers, in putting them in 
the front rank. Having 3 or 4 different kinds of 
glaze and sheets of the whitest cakes only about a 
third of an inch thick to cover with them you can 
cut them when set in squares or diamonds and 
triangles, red, white, yellow and chocolate, and they 



make a very pretty stack. Besides, small cakes, 
such as sponge drops, can be dipped in the icings 
while hot and another assortment made, just the 
thing for ornamental baskets and pyramids. 



9B« Chocolate Olaze without ^ggn. 

1 pound of sugar. 

J teacupful of water. 

4 ounces of common chocolate, grated. 

Boil all together almost to candy point, flavor 
with vanilla when partly cooled, beat a short time, 
spread over the cake. 

Colored syruf of fruit juice and sugar boiled 
down thick enc .gh to bubble and rise in the sauce- 
pan can be used instead of icings to cover cake with 
a glassy surface.

Items about Puff Paste. 



When puff-paste has been rolled out and folded 
up again 4 times it lies just like 2 quires of tissue 
paper piled alternately a yellow sheet with a white 
sheet — a sheet of butter and a sheet of paste, all of 
the same evenness and regularity from bottom to top. 
It is hard to get butter and dough to lie so equally, 
but that is what has to be tried for, and we have to 
show how to make them come so. If baked then 
the sheets of paste or dough would be as sharp as knife 
blades, and might cut the mouth of the rash person 
who should try to eat them, the butter having all run 
out into the baking pan. One more rollijig and 
folding makes the layers two-thirds thinner, and 
eatable, and another rolling after that makes the 
layers thin enough to be blown away with the 
breath. 

The reason of these unfinished sheets of paste be- 
ing so sharp edged and continuous is, there is no 
shortening rubbed into the flour when fine puff- 
paste is wanted — the layers of dough are nothing 
but flour and water. Rubbing part or all of the 
butter or lard into the flour dry makes short-paste, 
but not the marvellous, flaky, high-flying puff-paste. 
Those who get their first instructions in home places 
never want to believe that. 

Some people say it is a matter of light totich, a 
peculiar temperament, a something inherited that 
makes certain individuals always and easily suc- 
cesses at making puff-paste and others always fail- 
ures. They say women make better paste than men. 
There is no grounds for such a distinction. The 
probability is, it is a matter of sense and study, of 
head work more than hand work. A giddy person 
does not make fine paste, but is is not their hand 
that's giddy, it's their head. It is cause and effect 
again, and some cannot see their relation. Some 
people cannot place rolls in straight rows in the pan, 
nor lay strips on pies diamond-wise.

THE ikMBBIOAN PA8TBT OOOK. 



It makes all the difference when a fresh cub comes 
in the kitchen to be pastry cook's boy, if he has 
been one of those young ones that stand with their 
chin on the kitchen table seeing their mother make 
pies. 

The others are amusing green and awkward. 
They will pour a pint of water into a big pan of flour 
and then go feeling around for the lumps it makes, 
and pick them out one by one. They could not 
work the lump of dough they get that way without 
a sledge hammer, and pie dough has to be about as 
soft as mush. The way is to pour the water in a 
hole made in the middle of the flour, and gently stir 
it round with two fingers till it has gathered in flour 
enough so it can be lifted out of the pan on to the 
table, there to be worked smooth and fit to roll out. 

The best puff-pa^te is that made in 10, 15 or 20 
minutes, according to the quantity, when one has no 
time to spare for packing it between pans of pounded 
ice, or for other foolishness, when the butter has 
been worked smooth and pliable beforehand, and 
lies ready in a pan of ice-water — when the ice- water 
stands ready to mix with, the flour is cold and the 
oven is hot and waiting — then you turn out paste 
that puffs and rises high and dry and wholesome. 
The reason is the ingredients don't have time to get 
warm and soggy, and there is an immense amount 
of labor and trouble saved over the ice packing way. 
Still, of course, the same method is not practicable 
in every place. 

When the plain, soft flour and water dougn nas 
been rolled out as if for cutting biscuits out of, but 
instead is covered all over with the required amount 
of butter in lumps, and then the dough is folded 
over it, the w.^jential thing and the only difficult one 
is to get the dough and butter to roll out again and 
again at even pace. Soft butter will give way under 
the rolling-pin and leave its place, burst through, or 
out at the ends. It is of no use trying with really 
soft butter, but when it is of medium firmness the 
dough may be mixed very soft to match it, and good 
paste may be made. With the flour and water ex- 
tremely cold, the butter often hardens in the paste 
instead of softening — that is success, whether done 
in one or two hours in an ice-chest or in ten minutes 
on a cold table. There is another difficulty in the 
way of even distribution — the more the dou^h is 
worked and rolled the tougher it beomes and 
springs back, while the butter doe* not. To over- 
come that, the paste is allowed to rest awhile after 
about three rollings, but it is better in warm 
weather to get along without such an interval, by 
not kneading the dough at all, and having it soft 
enough at the start. The experienced workman 
goes through a certain routine every day that meets 
all exigencies, and his work is always alike, while 
others talk about the luck and havinir *k light hand 
for fine paste. 



They make a great fuss — the people who make 
verses do — about the beauties of milking the cows; 
as if there were no flies and cows didn't kick I It b 
much more charming to be working the butter. We 
have seen them at summer resort houses. They gp 
where* the spring water runs cold, and work the 
lump of butter in a trough till it is just perfection 
to make puff paste with — ^though no dairy maid ever 
will let her fresh lump of butter go for such a pur- 
pose. We have to work the butter as well as the 
time allowable in the crowded forenoon permits by 
pounding it in a wooden bowl with a potato masher 
Cold butter that is not so broken and made pliable 
is as bad as warm, for it will not be pressed out by 
rolling, but cuts its way through in lumps every- 
where. 

We have another newer and entirely different 
way of making fine leaf paste, but like this common 
way the best for meeting all the varied requirements 
of hotel work, and this is the formula. 



98. 



Puff Paste. 



1 pint of water (2 coffeecupfuls.) 

Flour — all the water will take up. 

Butter — from 1} to 2 pounds. 

Mix the flour and water to soft dough. Roll it 
out about an inch thick. Take half the butter and 
drop it in lumps the size of eggs upon the sheet of 
dough, the width of two fingers between each lump. 
Sift a little flour over, press the butter into the 
dough slightly, then fold the dough over in three. 
Roll out to the same thickness as before, distribute 
the remaining half of the butter over it, dredge, and 
fold over in three again, and count that one fold — 
the former folding with only half the butter in counts 
nothing, or ** half a turn." Always keep the dough 
rolled out to square shape and turn the broad side 
towards you after folding. Roll and fold till you 
have counted 6 times. Use plenty of flour under 
and over until the last rolling when the surplus 
should be swept off. It is then ready for use. 
»9. 

After a few trials neither butter nor flour need be 
weighed — the rule of butter size of an egg two 
fingers apart is all that is wanted, and the amount 
to be made can be governed by the cups or dippers 
of water used.

Iiard for Puff-Paste. 



Then there is the question of expense. They hate 
to furnish first-rate butter enough to make gjood 
puff-paste ; people are fond of pies and pastries, and 
it costs like sixty. There is little use in making 
paste as rich as it can be made anyway, except when 
it is for fancy articles — the tall puffed up edges of 
pies are oftenest thrown away with all their fine 
butter in them — only because people cannot eat 



THB AMEBIOAN PASTB7 OOOX.

ever)rthing, and the middle of the pie goes first. 
Butter that is only just a little off does well enough* 
but butter that is bad spoils the whole article, filling 
and all, clear through. Good lard is far better than 
poor butter to make good eatable white and light 
pastry, and some sorts will make just as tall puff- 
paste as butter will. Oily and grainy lard will not ; 
it has to be the firm, tough tenacious kind of dried 
out lard. The very best everyday kind of paste is 
made with half butter and half good firm lard. 
Then a little salt must be strewn over the lumps of 
laid after they are spread on the dough. Butter 
alone carries salt enough. 



31. 



Compressed Lard. 



The most wonderfully light and tall puff-paste, 
that beat butter pastry all hollow, used to be made 
in the times when lard oil was used in immense 
quantities before kerosene came in, of the.stearine 
lard, the residue left after pressing out the oil. This 
was as hard as tallow, but of a. different texture. 
Oil is the greatest enemy to pufT-paste, and stearine 
contains none. Then we had vol*au vents that a 
small goose could be hid in, chat rose several inches 
high of their own lightness. 

It looks like the sweet fresh suet that comes in so 
plentifully with the fat loins of beef ought to be 
better f«r pastry than strong butter and miserable 
oily lard, and so it .is and comes next to the stearine 
lard mentioned above, but can only be used after 
going through a particular process. People try to 
use melted suet or tallow or drippings, and they 
mince raw suet and then pound it fine, but however 
good short paste these may make they will not pro- 
duce puff-paste. The suet or tallow is always com- 
posed of hard grains that cut through and destroy 
the fiakes. The proper process is something of a 
trade secret; a good thing for those who work for 
themselves to save butter by. 



S9. 



To Prepare Suet for Making: 
Puff-Paste. 



Cut the suet very small, leaving out all dark meat 
stained pieces, and set on the side of the range in a 
boiler with plenty of hot water. The suet must not 
boil but steep in scalding water for a few hours. 
Then pour water and all into a large strainer with a 
bottom of perforated tin — a gravy strainer — and rub 
the fat through with a potato masher. Get a pan 
of broken ice and water and a little salt in it, and 
dip the strained fat by ladlefuls into it, stirring the 
ice about at the same time. The fat sets instantly 
on falling into the cold water in crumbs like meal. 
Gather it by straining, press it together and pound it 
with a masher in a bowl as you would butter. Salt 
it for use. 



Some years ago — about the close of the war — the 
writer had a friendly contention with a fine cook 
who made splendid pastry, as to whether as fine puff 
paste could not be made by the old-fashioned way 
just explained, as by this following. It was finally 
decided, after both ways had been tested to the ut- 
most, that there was no difference in the results, but 
there are certain every-day work considerations in 
favor of the old way. The leaf paste is fine for 
fancy tarts. The workman who would be perfect in 
his trade will practice both. It's bad to have a fel- 
low come along and beat you. 



33« French Puff Paste or Feuilletage. 

It is requisite to have the butter very firm and 
free from water, and those who wish to have very 
superior pastry will use the very finest flour. 

Weigh your butter and flour in equal proportions, 
cut the butter into thin slices, take a little flour and 
roll it with a slice of butter into flakes, proceed thus 
until all the butter and flour are rolled together; 
gather the flakes into a heap, and sprinkle them 
with water, about a gill and a half is required for a 
pound of paste. Make into a smooth paste with the 
hand, and then roll it out to the thickness of half an 
inch. If a pound of paste, divide it into four parts, 
flour the board and roll out each part as thin as a 
wafer, fold over four or five times, and use as re- 
quired. Bake as soon as possible. 

Then try this, and hold fast that which you suc- 
ceed with the best. 



34. 



Fine Leaf Paste. Ten-Minute 
Paste, 



1 pound of cold butter. 

1 pound of cold flour. 

i pint of ice-water — a coffecupful. 

Cut the butter into pieces size of walnuts and put 
them in a vessel containing broken ice and water 
some time before using, to become very hard and 
cold. 

*Sift the flour into a pan and lay aside a handful 
to dust with. Throw in the lumps of butter, mix 
them with the dry flour, pour in the ice water and 
shake altogether, merely getting the flour dampened 
and stud: to the lumps of butter, without kneading 
or pressing. Scrape out the contents of the pan on 
to the table well floured, press it up together and 
then roll it out with all the force necessary to break 
the lumps of butter, and spread all out to a thin 
sheet. Now loosen it from the table with the 
palette knife and roll it up like a roly-poly pudding, 
and count 1. Roll it out again to half an inch, fold 
over in three like ordinary paste and count 2, and so 
roll and fold in three till you have counted 6 fold- 
ings. But when half done it should have an inter- 
val of 5 or 10 minutes to stand in a cold place and 
lose its elasticity.

8ff« Lemon Pie. Best Hotel Kind. 

1 pound of white sugar. 
5 lemons. 

1 quart of water or milk. 

2 ounces of com starch. 

16 yolks of eggs —or 8 whole eggs. 

1 ounce of butter. 

Pat the sugar in a saucepan, grate in the lerno^ 
rinds— the yellow only — and squeeze in the juice 
without the bitter seeds. Pour in the water and set 
the saucepan on to boil. Mix the 2 tablespoonfuls 
of stacrch with a little cold water, pour it into the 
saucepan when the syrup is boiling and immediately 
take it off the fire. Then mix in the yolks slightly 
beaten — and the butter. They are not to be cooked 
in it. Bake in pie pans lined with puff-paste rolled 
out thin. Sift powdered sugar over the pies when 
done, or else meringue over with the white of eggs 
and sugar. 

Can one advocate simplicity and short bills of fare 
and a few things well cooked, and then give six 
ways of making lemon pies and other things similar? 
Yes. Not for one person to make the same thing 
six ways so much as for six persons to pick out the 
method that suits their particular circumstances and 
style of table they cook for. And as with pie mix- 
ture so with many other things in this book. For

Place the sugar in a large bowl and grate the 
lemon rinds into it, using a tin grater, and then 
squeeze in the juice. Beat the yolks of eggs light 
and mix the cream with them; pour this to the 
lemon and sugar, and just before filling the pie 
crusts with the mixture whip the 6 whites to a froth 
and stir them in. No meringue needed for this rich

much the camal reader who thinks of pie only as 
some'hing to eat may be amused at the idea we as- 
sure him there are possibilities of taking high posi- 
tion among the fiber things of beauty on the weal 
thy table f r the hotel pie which do not exist for the 
priTate hcuse pie. or the baker's pie, or if th^ do 
are so remote it will take ages of domestic pie cul- 
ture to brirg them in sight. The experienced hotel 
Bieward knows now instantly when he has secured 
a ftiliy developed hotel or fine steamboat pie maker. 
Your baker trained to work for the hungry pie eater 
rather than fbr the luxurious admirers of beautify 
pies ooTers every pie with » top cnut» which is the 
first bign, but the great sign of his standing is f et 
up when he takes both hands and cuts off the pnst. 
ry by pressing against the edge of the plate, whirl- 
ing the pie round at the same time. Why should 
he make or wish to make fine leaf paste to press and 
mash in that wsyT But your first-class pastry cook 
having made his paste so that the flakes will rise 
and open as distinct and separate as the leaves of a 
rose and of a thinness more impalpable than tha*, 
no matter how rapidly he may work, will roll even- 
ly, throw it on the pie pan light'y, shake it down to 
place with a little jar upon the table, take it up on 
the fingers of the left hand and cut around with a 
sharp knife, not leaving the least sign of pressure, 
finger mark or drag or tear about iL These pies 
though having tall flake-piled edges are pretty sure 
to be'almost as dry and free from grease as flab y 
biscuits and quite wholesome both to eat and to see. 
If people say that hotel pies are not so we reply that 
it is because the pastry art is somewhat difficult and 
there are frw masters of i», the begi ners are slow ti 
get hold of the fi e touches and the hotels are full 
of half laughi beginners. We don't know anything 
about the private houses, and these remarks make 
no inridious reflections upon the household pie. 
With both bottom and top crust rolled thin and 
powdered sugar on top it i^ good. But the hotel pie 
contemplates^ife ftrom a different stand point and 
like all the products of high art it is somewhat aris- 



tocratic Literature is cheap and common — ^you can 
buy a mre classic for ten cents — the best thoughts 
of the best writers for a nickel — imitations not to be 
detected of the rarest gems for a dollar or two- but 
the ideal hotel pie is only for the few. 

So careful and tender is the good workman of his 
leaf paste that he slants the knife outwards when 
cutting that the paste may be wide and make a 
broad edge; and that broad edge he notches wi'h a 
sharp knift in the places where the pie is to be 
divided, lest with a rude pressure somebody will 
crush and spoil the flakes in cutting the pie after it 
is bakecL

43. Merinffue for Lemon Pies. 

The secret of making the meringue or frosting 
stand tall and thick on the pies is in the baking. 
Whip the whites of eggs to a froth that will not fall 
out of the bowl or pail when turned upside down, 
put in about a tablespoonfhl of granulated sugar for 
each white, stir very little, spread it on the pies 
when they are Just done and still baking hot with- 
out taking them out of the oven, and let them bake 
with the door open. If made hot enough to brown 
the meringue will surely fall and become worse than 
nothing. 5 to 10 minutes is enough to bake the 
meringue dry and straw-colored. Sift granulated 
sugar on top of the meringue as soon as spread, be- 
fore baking, to form a rich appearing crust for vari- 
ety. 



44. 



Ooooanut Oustcurd Pie. 



Make a common plain custard of 1 quart of milk, 
6 or 8 eggs and 6 ouncf's of sugar, then mix in 8 to 
12 ounces of gra'ed cocoaout. Bake in crusts. 

45. Ckxx>anat Pie. Hotel Ordinary, 



1 quart of milk. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of com starch. 
1 ounce of butter. 

8 ounces of grated cocoannt. 

6 eggs. 

Boil the milk, mix the starch in the sugar dry 
and stir them in and the butter and cocoanut, and 
then take the mixture ftrom the fire. Stir in the 
eggs after it has cooled a little. The eggs should be 
beaten quite light first. Sift powdered sugar over 
the pies afer baking. 

For cocoanut meringue pie make the preceding 
mixture with 12 yolks of eggs and take the whites 
to beat up for the meringue. Strew cocoanut on 
top before baking.

The same mixture as the above made ywj deli,

then stirring in instead of yolks 12 or 14 whites of 
eggs whipped to a froth, and a slight flavoring of 
rose and orange. 8ifi powdered sugar over when

Oranffe Pie. 



Generally made with the ob^eot of using up a sur- 
plus of perishable fruit. 

Peel half the number of oranges required. With 
a very sharp knife slice them across the oore, throw 
out the seeds, lay the slices over the bottoms of 
paste-lined pie pans alternately with slioes of un- 
peeled oranges. Strew sugar over and pour over 
that a cooking-spoonful of red wine. Bake slowly 
till the juice is become thick syrup.

Oran^re Butter Pie* 



8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of best fresh butter. 

9 eggs. 

2 oranges. 

Gratd the rinds and squeeze the juice of the oraa* 
ges into the sugar in a deep stueepan, put in the 
butter and then the fggs slightly beaten. Set the 
mixture over the fire and stir it till it becomes thick 
and ropy, like melted cheese. It may lessen the 
trouble, and danger of burning on the bottom to set 
it in a large saucepan containing boiling water. 
When done beat the mixture with an egg whisk a 
few minutes. The cooking of this mixture causes it 
to remain light and thick and rounded in the pies 
or tarts afler baking, instead of filling and becom- 
ing W4xy as it otherwise would do. Bake in a very 
siow oven or with a pan on the shelf above to ward 
off the heat. 



40. Oranffe Dariole Fillinff . Riohest* 



Requires deep pans for baking in as it flows over 
ordinary rims. 

1 pound of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

.4 oranges. 
. 10 eggs. 

Grate and squeeze the oranges into the sugcjr, add 
the butter and eggs and cook the mixture thi jk over 



the fire with constant stirring Let it cool and then 
beat it ligtit before ling the crusts. 



And yet some worthy hopefUls having seen pie 
edges stand two inches high in distinct flakes while 
weigbiug next to nothing, will do their brave en- 
deavors too, and lay a double edge on theirs, ma- 
king a band of paste to place on the rim of the plate 
first, washed with egg, and the proper pie crust laid 
on top. That is all wrong. We told them they 
could not make our hotel pies. For if the airiest 
crust that can be laid on a pie edge will hardly be 
Often is it not folly to double the weight and sub- 
etance? Puff-pasie perfectly made will rise high 
enough from one layer only from an eighth to a 
quarter inch thick. If it will not then it will not 
when doubled in thickness. And, besides, how 
much valuable time is wasted from better work, 
putting a useless double edge on the pies.

Apple Oream Pie. 



Marlborouffh Puddinff or Pie. 



1 pint of stewed i^ples. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

1 cupful of milk. 

4 ounces of bu Iter. 

4 egga. 

Little sherry wine and nutmeg* 

Mix all together. Bake in crusts. 



51. Apple Oustard Pie or Puddinff. 



1 quart of dry stewed apples. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

8 oi.nces of butter. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

Juice and riud of 1 lemon and nutmeg. 

Tbe apples should be slewed with as little water 
as possible with the steam shut in. Mash them 
through a strainer. Cook the pulp over the fire 
with the sugar and butter in and then add the beat- 
en yolks and flavor. Bake in crusts. 



And where it is so requisite to have the fine flakee 
of puff-paste lie straight and undisturbed care must 
be taken in handling the small portions when roll- 
ing out pie crusts. Green people always will take 
the trimmings of the last pie and work and knead 
and pound and press ^it to death. You musn't do 
that. Lay the scraps in layers in a pile loose on 
each other. Cut a chunk square and small from the 
large piece of paste and lay it on top of the scraps, 
rhen roll out to a quarter inch thickness. Now you 
don't want the bottom crust of the pie to be so thick 
as that — nobody wants to eat so much soggy under 
crust — but you do want that thickness for the edge. 
So double the sheet of paste over on itself in hal£

and with the end of the rolling pin toU that part 
that will be the middle of the pie to half the thiok- 
ness. You will of course have flour enough about 
it to preyent stiokiog together. Then open out the 
doubled sheet again and you have a hollow thinbot- 
tomed sheet of paste just ready to fit the pie pan. 
and with a thick edge to hold in the oustarda and 
lemon mixtures.

Apple Piee. 



1. Pare the apples and slice them off the cores in- 
to a bright pan or brass kettle. To every pound al- 
low on an aversge a quarter pound of white sugar 
and a cupful of water. Throw in 6 oloTes or some 
lemon peel for flayer, shut with a tight lid and let 
■tew slowly in the steam. Mash through a oolaa 
der. Bake in open pies. Apples of poor quality 
that turn blue in cooking are often improTed by the 
addition of the juice of a lemon. 

2. Apples cored and quartered and stewed in fla 
Tored syrup like preseryes without breaking may be 
filled into shell pies or Tol-au-yenta baked separately, 
as explained fiinher on. For eyery pound of the 
apple quarters allow 6 ounces of sugar and half cup 
of water with doyes and lemon peel. Let the syr- 
up boil first, throw in the apple quarters and shut 
in the steanu Simmer half an hour without stirring 
them. 

8. Early green apples. Wash and steam them 
whole. Mash through a colander, add sugar, but- 
ter and oinoamoTi or nutmeg. Bake with a top 
crust. Powd- red pugar over when done. 

4. Sliced apple pie. Use this way only the best 
ripe cooking apples Pare and core them and slice 
them thin across the core. Fill pasteJined pie pans, 
about 2 layers deep. Thinly eoyer the apple slices 
with sugar and grate nutmeg oyer. Put i<i each pie 
butter eiie of a walnut and a large spoonful of wa- 
ter. Bake without a top crust s)owly and dry. 
The apples become transparent and half candied. 



53. Pineapple Oream Pie. 



1 quart of pineapple either grated, or chopped 
and pounded. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

1 cupful of cream. 

12 yolks of eggs. 

Gjok the pineapple pulp and sugar together a fi»w 
minutes, add the cream and the yolks well beaten, 
bake in thin crusts. The same ingredients all stirr- 
ed oyer the fire till cooked thick, make a pineapple 
eream to spread on layer cakes, and fill tarta. 

54. 

Cranberries haye a better color oooked with the 
sugar. To a quart of cranberries allow a half pound 
of sugsr, and water to coyer the bottom of the yes- 
ael only, oook in their own steam about half an hour. 



They sooreh easily— should not be set in the hottest 
place. The juice that can be strained fh>m them 
without mashing makes the brightest jelly when 
cold. Mash the rest through a colander for pies. 

Strawberries should be put in the crusts raw and 
sugar strewn oyer. Canned strawberries shoutd be 
strained from the juice and that boiled down with 
sugar to about half, and the ftruit returned to it. 

Peaches use same as apples, also for peach custard 
pie. The peach kernels stewed with the fruit 
heighten the flayor. 

Gooseberries green require 12 ounces of sugar to 
a pound of f^uit; they should be partly mashed 
with the back of a spoon for better mingling with 
the sweet. 

Plums and such large fhiits are not seryioeable 
unless cut or broken. A can of currants or whortle- 
berries will make fiye pies and the same siied can 
of plums only two or three. 

Quinces giye an improyed flayor to apples stewed 
with them. Quince pies may be made by grating 
the fhiit and mixing with sugar, or by stewing 
sliced quinces with water and lemon j nice and then 
adding sugar to make a thin syrup. Best for shell 
pica. Bartlett pears make good pies. Some other 
yarieties can be used like quinces. 

Bhubarb should be oooked with only water 
enough to coyer the bottom of the kettle, a half 
pound of brown sugar to a pound of the stalks 
spread oyer the top and the steam shut in 

Baspberries, currants, blackberries and all such 
fhiits as are apt to become all juice should have the 
same ayoidance of water as rhubarb and be cooked 
in their own steam. 

Bananas and Plantains are made into pies in the 
South in the same manner as has been direeted for 
sliced apple pies, with mace and wine or brandy 
added. 

Tomatoes can be used in pies if boiled down with 
sugar. Scald and peel and let them drain of half 
their juice. To each pint of draied tomatoes allow 
4 ounces of sugar and a little bruised race ginger. 
Stew down thick. 

Figs either fivsh or dried can be made into pies, 
cut up and stewed in syrup with a lemon or two and 
some butter.

like those shown below. Roll out the paste to about 
a quarter of an inch in thickness, or even thinner, 
cut out with the double cutter, place the tartlets in 
pans like biscuits and bake in a brisk oven. They 
rise to three or four times the heigh th of the paste 
they are cut from. Lift out the little lid made by 
the cutter in the middle or else push it down and 
fill the c*vity wirh a spoonful of red currant jelly or 
lemon honey or any kind of fruit or preserves.

1. For the form shown in the middle roll out the 
finest leaf paste to about an eighth of an inch in 
thicWnes). Cut it in squares of about 2J inches and 
fold over the four coroers to meet in the middle 
where there should be a drop of water placed to 
make them s'ick. Stamp out a round piece of paste 
like a lozenge and lay on the center. Brush over 
with a little beaten egg-and-water without wetting 
the edges of the paste, and bake. The shell can be 
partly hollowed out when done, and filled with any

2. For the left hand figure roll out the same as 
the preceding and out and fold over the same and 
then out pieoes out of the four sides to make the 
shape shown. These leaf tartlets open out and rise 
as high in baking as the middle figure. Fill th® 
hollows with bright Aruit jelly

filliog— either mince or^salpicoD, or yellow or red 
ooDserye or jelly-baked in them. Boll out » sheet 
of puff-paste and out out like biscuits, with a large 
cutter. Place a teaspoonful of the filling in each, 
wet the edge of the paste and pinch it up in the 
shape of a threccornered hat. Brush oTcr with 
egg-and water and dredge with granulated sugar if 
^or a sweet tart. Bake in a rather slack oTon. 

Beside the foregoing, other shapes may be made 
by stamping out the & ^iot paste with an oval cut 
terand doubling the ats oTcr like French split 
rolls, and by doubling oTcr square outs. These 
open up like the .leaves of a book and jelly or pre-

Y3. American Popular loets. 



The combinations following are not too dreadftdly 
original in idea to be eminently proper ''according 
to Hoyle," neither are they copies. They are inno- 
cent American Tariations of the class of European 
*'iced-puddiDgSy*' and bombes a la Vtennoue, They 
are popular ices in the sense that they are among 
the things which make hotel tables popular with 
high-priced people. They are among the super.ez. 
cellenoes and quiet surprises which giTC — but there, 
we are getting beyond our depth — what we do want 
to say is that served individually they can be man- 
aged easily enough in the hotels which do not em- 
ploy a confectioner or men specially detailed to 
make the tees, but where the pastry cook has to be 
a man-o£>all-work; while the moulding in **bombes" 
invoWes a great expenditure of time and freezing 
material. These have all been well tried and often. 
The simplest and best methods of moulding, firoth- 
ing, freezing eto. will also be found explained among 
the commoner ices ftirther on. 



Kasterskill Ices. 



Combination of rose pink cream with pale green 
ice containing grapes and almonds. Two freezers 
required* 

14* Rofle Ice Cream* 

I quart of cream. 

12 ounces of sugar. 



12 eggs. 

A pinch of salt, coloring and flavoring. 

Take off a third of the cream, the thickest, from 
the top, and keep it cold to be whipped to froth, 
while the other is freezing. Boil toe rest of tne 
cream with the sugar in it, which prevents burning. 
Beat the eggs in a bowl as light as if for sponge 
cake, pour the boiling cream and sugar to them and 
cook about a minute together— enough to slightly 
thicken but not boil. Strain into a freezer immedi- 
ately, add a few drops of rose extract and some 
bright red fruit syrup such as the surplus juice from 
crimson strawberries in sugar, or else some drops of 
red coloring, to make the crevm light pink. Freeze, 
and when nearly finished whip the reserred cream 
to fix>th and beat it in. 

When cream thick enough to whip cannot be had 
keep out the whites of the eggs and use the same 
way instead. 

76. C^rape and Almond Ice. 

6 pints of sweet white muscat grapes free from 
stems. 

1 pint of angelica or other sweet wiM. 

l.pint of water. 

1 pound of sugar. 

1 large ripe lemon. 

1 pound of almonds blanched. 

Stew three pints of the grapes with the water and 
sugar and when tender rub the pulp through a 
strainer into a freezer, together with the syrup. 
Add the wine and the lemon cut in thick short 
slices with the seeds careftilly excluded, and 
fr*eeze the mixture. At the last drop in the 
blanched almonds and after a few more turns of the 
freezer add the remaining 2 pints of grapes previoua- 
ly made cold on ice. Cover down the freezer that 
the ice may become well frozen. 

To serve individually make a border of the 
cream with the spoon in broad champagne glasses or 
&ncy ice glasses, and in the middle pile the grape 
and almond sherbet. 

For fancy moulded creams line the moulds with 
the first part and fill the centers with the second. 

lO. 

A favorite form of banibe is frozen in a mould in 
the shape of a little glass jug with handle and all 
complete. This is coated inside with a translucent 
fruit or flavored syrup ice and the filling is of, for ex- 
ample, a maraschino ice erf am, or one dotted with 
strawberries. ^^ hen the bombe well frozen is taken 
out of its mould and set on the table on its folded 
napkin, you are, if you please, to knock off the neck 
of the ju« and dip out the contents. It is surmised

1 pound of sugar. 

8 ounces of desiccated cocoanut— the sugared kind

4 oranges. 

2 lemons. 

Bed fruit juice or*ooloring. 

Make a hot syrup of the water and sngur. Slice 
the oranges and lemons small and throw away the 
seeds, pat the slices in a bowl with the desiccated 
eoooanut, pour the hot syrup over them and let steep 
a short time. Then strain the flavored syrup into a 
freeser, add the wine and ooloriog to make it light 
pink and freexe. Mike the scalded orange and 
lemon slioes and ooooanut cold on ice and stir them 
into the sherbet when nearlj frozen, then pack down 
the freeser to freeze the contents firm. 

To serre indiYidually place the frozen custard in

and the sherbet pile up in the middle. 

And «iced-pudding" is no better name, although

Frozen Fruit in loeB. 



Broadly speaking it may be said, OTcrybody that 
likes fruit iocs or sherbets likes the frozen pieces of 
fruit scattered through them as well. But there are 
differences which it would be tedious to point in 
each case depending upon the degree" of sweetness 
of the fruit. Strawberries containing little or no 
sugar will freeze in a strawberry water ioe too un- 
reasonably solid to be good, while sweet Tokay and

not prevent rich eream from transforming itself into 
the semblance of skimmed milk. 

Now when they get through with that tedious 
ele^stric light subdivision perhaps the inventors will 
subdivide the artificial ice machines so that ice cream 
can be made in every little house in some lees clum-

Some Points on loe-oream and other 
loes. 

So I said to Johnny said I, Johnny you're stuck 
with this miserable little ice-cream saloon, and the 
little soTenty fiye dollars you* ye put in is gone sky* 
wards, don't you know iiT And you owe a month's 
rent beside. And here at the i-ame time are your 
dollars (hat ought to be and your tens and hundreds 
Bitting along on the hotel piazzas and riding by and 
walking right by your forsaken little den, but they 
won't come in. Of course they won't. Why should 
they when you don't know the first rudiments of the 
business. Johony, don't you remember when you 
used to turn the freezers for two mortal hours enough 
sight slower than the tick of your graod&ther's 
clock, when you ought to have been done in twenty 
or thirty minutes, wasting ice and salt, spoiling the 
cream and wearing out me? And now you'll go up 
for want of Irnowing something. Now if you was 
dead for instance and a smart boy had this instead 
it would not be this way. There are bigger resorts 
than this, don't you know? and some where the 
confectioneries and all are made under the s-^me 
roof, but, let me tell you, eyen there the extra fine 
creams and loes are in a side show and are extra 
charges, and more so at all commoner places unless 
<he pastry 'cook has uncommon ambition to shine. 
But you take a hotel that's got two hundred summer 
people, and there's two pastry cooks, but after 



they'ye worked up tlieir barrel of flour a day In 
all shapes, and other things in proportion, and hoi 
weather at thai, they don't feel much like spreading 
themseWes on fiancy creams and ices, and it's the 
same miserable lemon custard and yanilla oustard 
sort of frozfu any way to put it through at thisii(^ 
tel and that hotel, ftnd if the people are asked to 
▼isit at the other hotel they are sure to be treated 
to the same old thing again. Well then they go to 
the cafe and fine restaurant where iheee things aze 
made specialties, and that's what yon ought to be 
doing now Johnny if jou knew how. 

But in the first place yon don't hayeioe-oream on 
hand Iialf the time and people as they pass say '<oh 
its of no use, they hardly eyer haye any there," so 
they quit coming because th^y don't like to be dis- 
appointed, you must keep it if you haye to make a 
pint at a time in a quart cup eyen, as you easily can 
ifyou understand it, audit posit iyely must be al- 
ways good, always tip-top^ ifyou expect to build up 
atrade, and it can't be ifyou make it once a day, 
in the morning, and keep it all diiy and night; for 
the goodness of it is its smoothness and oreaminess, 
but that gets away when the cream in kept long 
Water in freezing will sep ^rate from eyerytbii^ 
else, so thai you get blear ice out of muddy riyers, 
and the water part of yinegar will tref ze and leaye 
the acid part by itself in the center of the barrel; 
just that way your cream fir^t gets grains of clear ice 
in it like sand, and by night your customers find 
rough chunks as big as pipe stems. For the yery 
same reasons good cream cannot be made by letting 
it stand and freeze itself. It wants rapid work. 

QUICK FBBEZIMO. 

Now, Johnny, you begin light. Qet yoa a stoat 
oaken box bound with hoop iron ifyou can, to pound 
the ioe small in. It will proye the cheapest way in 
the long run, for you must pound the ice small to 
do quick freezing and cheap, and no way beats 
pounding it with an old aze head in a deep box. 
You mnyturn your freezer two hours and do no 
good if it has only large lumps of ice just touching it 
with their edges. It is the salt acting on the ice 
and releasing the oold by melting it that causes your 
cream to fieeze and the quicker the melting takes 
place through thorough mixing of salt in fine ice the 
quicker your cream is done, and coarse saH is bet 
ter than fine because it won't paok in dead lumps, 
and because it grinds the ice away. We are not 
canng for strict science, only for the effects as they 
appear. So the quickest possible freezing is done 
with snow and ice mixed together. And, Johnny, 
don't you remember how snorting mad you used to 
be when I would come down on you fbr about twt 



THE AMERICAN PA8TKT COOK.

seooDds while you was see sawiog away at (hat frees 
er and say '<wby in thunder don't you let (be salt 
water out?" — and when I came again and found the 
water out it was "what in thunder did yuu let all 
the water out forT" 

Well, Johnny, I have no meringues in the oven 
DOW and PU stop to explain. Your oream never 
freezes much except where the brine of the melted 
ice and salt touches the freezer, as the brine rises 
•rtside you will find the freezing mark rises ioside; 
but when there gets to be too much water the ice ri- 
ses and floats and the bottom of ihe freezer bpgios 
to melt ag lin. You want to keep lettiog out a little 
w«ter from the bung-hole near the bottom of the 
freeziDg tub but not too much, aod always keep push- 
ing aad packing the ice down arou> d the freezer to 
keep it solid and touching both bottom and sides. In 
this way you can do freezing in twenty or thirty 
minutes better than in two hours. The amount of 
salt you want is about one bucket of salt to fiye of 
broken ice. Half fill your freezing tub with ice 
first, then begin putting in scoopfuls of salt with the 
ice, and it will work itself down Always finish vft 
the top with a layer of salt. Don't you see now 
what an idiot you was not to understand these little 
things, and the quality of the cream for two hundred 
high-toners depending on your ignorance? In order 
to get the little brine sometimes in the dead of win-' 
ter when eyery thing was too cold I have had to pour 
hot water on the ice in the freezing tub to start it. 
These points apply to all sorts of freezers that use 
ice and salt. The noted oooks across the sea who 
nyented some of the fine ices that you are going to 
make afrer awhile Johnny, neyer patronized our 
new patent freezers but did and perhaps still do their 
fine work with the old kind turned by hand. 

CBEAM AND ITS SUBSTITUTES. 

And, Johnny, you don't need real oream so much 
as you need a thorough beatin^r. If a man that knew 
how was to open next door in opposition toyou he might 
take milk and you might take cream, and soon you 
would hear customers say '<ah, the oream next door 
is the best, it certainly must be made of the purest 
cream, you can taste it, it is so rich I" when in fact 
it would be its foamy smoothness and delicacy that 
gave them the impression, while your real cream 
would be coarse with grains of ice, and heayy with 
sugar. It does not make nearly so much difi^erenoe 
how you make your cream as how you freeze it and 
keep it. Why you may take a sweet water ice, es- 
pecially a white cherry ice, or a peach ice mil do, 
some kind with the sweet pulp mashed in it, and 
make it according to diieotiens it will be so white, 



so soft and foamy, and will increi^e in bulk so much 
it can't be told from oream except by melting which 
I want to say shows that it isn't the cream itsel 
(hat makes the quality, since sweetened fruit juice 
will do so well, and better yet if mixed with' cream 
like our cherries in cream some way back, but tiie 
method. So haying prepared your cream, custard, 
or sherbet put it in a fr-eezer large enough to hold 
twice as much and strive to make the ice fill the 
freezer when done. 

The greatest help but not the only material for 
the purpose is sums raw but light -beaten white of 
eggs. The French cooks, some of them, use what 
they call Italian meringue, which is a boiling sugar 
yrup made of six cuoces of sugar, poared into four 
whites well whipped. If anyone who h^s tri d has 
found a difference in effect between that and the raw 
whites I will not gainsay (heir word, but, Johnny, yiu 
will find the shorter way good enough and it saves su- 
gar from wl;at is already generally too sweeL So when 
your ice is frozen mix in the whipped whites, and if 
it is a patent fieezer turn it aa fast as you can til 
you see the white ice forcing its way ont at the freeif 
er lid. That is if you want that sort, but if it is on- 
ly a demi-glaoe leave out the whites, like the pink 
pan of our Niagara ices, where the white desiccated 
cocoanut can be seeki powdered all through, as it 
could not be if the sherbet was beaten to whiteneas 
with egg. 

SAYS THE SUGAB 

And don't make the mistake of using too much su* 
gar. You must make a profit, and sugar is an ex 
penee in two ways, in its cost at first and then in 
ioe and salt for the more sugar* in your cre^m the 
more ioe it will take to freeze it. This you know is 
for common, though you want to be posted for fan- 
cy work too. When you go to Boston or Philadel- 
phia, Johnny, you'll find them advertising **VteBna 
ices," bombest bitquiia glciceea, etc. If made ''accord- 
ing to Hoyle" these Vienna ices have a pound of su- 
gar in every quart- of rich cream, and the ru'e for 
fhiit ices is a pound and a half to a quart. Just 
think of it — a cupful of granulated sugar in two 
oupfuls of thiok cream, and the fruit ices and sor 
beta all syrups heavier than soda syrups. When 
these are well frozen they are more of frozen con- 
fectioneries, or candies made by cold instead of 
heat then they are light refreshments. They are in. 
tended to be shaped in moulds and to have a good 
deal of solidity. Your rule for common ice-cream 
should be not more than half a pound of sugar to 
each quart of milk and three quarters of a pound to 
each quart of fhiit ioe or sherbet, and Johnny, 
though I would not write it so in a receipt for any- 



THE AMSBICAN PASTBT COOK. 



fM)d7, for it mif ht seem stingy, between you and me 
I tbink six ounces of sugar to eaoh quart of milk is 
enough for the ice-eream that is only a light refresh- 
ment that people may rat plenty of without hurting 
tbemseWee. They don't want food, but froien per- 
ftime. 

I got a les-on in popular ioe-cream making when 
I WHS a boy that has lasted me for oomparison of 
differeot feMows' ways evbr sinoe. at a gaily decora 
ted tent at New Orleans, on the levee and facing 
Tchoupitoulfls Ftreet. where their cream was sold 
as fast as tickets for a circus, handed rut in glaes<'s 
piled high, three or four colors and flaTors, and as 
many men freezing and beating, and as many more 
selling and forever yelling out, "Come up with an 
other freezer on the red/' and "come up with an- 
other freezer en the yaller." Their cream was 
light, and cheap and plentiAiI. It was late la May, 
and all the iee they used had come in ship loads 
from the north. They didn't sit down and see--s«w 
and Johnny, I don't think they used over pix ounces 
of sugar to a quart. But they had fine flavorings, 
and you don't think they had any real cream or 
wanted any, do you? 

AN -IBIUOTJS Id OBXAM. 

And you need n-t go into bankruptcy either 
merely because the big hotels are getting what little 
cream there is to be had and you can get none. 
They don't even get enough for coffee, after all. 
Some restaurant keepers buy the milk, skim it for 
thecreanrand trust to selling off the skimmed milk 
or part of it, so as to get their pure cream for freez- 
ing not soured and mouldy as country gathered 
eream often is, but that plan is not practicable for 
ioe-cream for thousands at a resort. Besides, who 
wants cream? you see these reeorts getting more 
crowded every year and more hotels and hrger ones 
being built, and that shows that the people find it 
pleasant living at them, but they wouldn't if they 
had the blues and felt tired and drowsy all the time 
as they would be if they were made bilious and dyi 
peptic with double cream and sugar. There it noth- 
ing 80 bad for the health and apirits at real buttery 
eream taken at the end of a full meal. Let the count- 
ry people who have nothing to do but sleep eat the 
oream, but you give iheresorters light refreshment 
and if your wares are well m^de they will come 
agMo ftft^f ^^^7 ^^^^ walked and danced and rolled 
ten pins. 

aSLATINK TK CBXAM. 

It is reckone'i quite a trie)* too, to put gelatine in 
your milk rr boiled cuwtard and gelatine is nice 
enough n** t^r as that goes, but somehow, John- 
ny, I find myself always letting it alone, though I 
don't know what I might do in oompe ition with 
others. Gelatine gives body 'o the mi' k and make<< 
it so it can be beaten up mo e light and f o'hy and 
the cream with ge'atine in will not melt down so 
quickly. It is a good enough rule to use i^elatine 



in milk and white of eggs in water ices, punches and 
so forth* The effect of both articles is about the 
same, bnt gelatine is the most ir uble But yon 
have to be very careful about the quantity of gela- 
tine used for if you don't look out it will set your 
eriram like b'anc-mange or jelly. One ounce to three 
quarts is th« big est you can use, Hnd it must be 
weU dissolved in warm n ilk before putting in. 

OBDINABT ICB-O; KAM. 

You will see some ice-cream makers put raw yolks 
of eggs in the cream because, they have found that 
cooking the eggs in it destroys the frothiog quality. 
I dont like that either, and I compromise by making 
a boiled s'areh custard with scant one ounce of 
8' arch to eaoh quart of milk, and beating two or 
three, or at most four yolks to a qtuirt light in a 
deep pan and pouring the scalding custard to them 
which htlf cooks the yolks and makes a oustard 
that can be churned to a fh>th if wanted. 



When you make a custard that way it saves ice to 
oook only half the milk with all the enriching ingre^ 
dients in and pour the other half cold to it after- 
wards. When you boil milk always boil the sugar 
in it, and that will prevent scorching on the bottom. 
Now, Johnny, brace up and go to*wr.rk, and when 
you get as fkr as moulding ice creams for party din- 
ners we will talk again. But that heavy iron sorap- 
er you have got made by a blacksmith is not^-ui'able, 
people of fine po'ceptinns cm taste iron in eream, be. 
sides you are liable to drive it through the bottom 
of your ft*eezer aod spoil all. The largest s'ze flezi. 
ble F alette knife is the best thing to loosen the fio- 
len cream Arom the sides of your old fhshioned 
freezer, and for the beating up of the oream make 
jourself a paddle of hard wood as long as a spade, 
but light and narrow; one that you can stand up 
wi h and have a good hold on to chum and beat 
with both hands. 

FLAVOniNQ 

Lemon and vanilla are the common popular flavors 
and lemon is the commonest of the two. U^e of 
them about a large basting spoonful of the extract to 
each gillnn of cream, remembering, however, that 
there is the common, the double and the triple extract 
of which latter of course less ought to do. ^' hen you 
get to doing a big business you will have the pleasure 
of offering ytiur customers a choice of as mnny flavors 
of eream as there are of soda syrups But all 
flavors except lemon and vanilla must be'u^ed very 
sparingly, a t^aspoonfUl of pineapple. Rtrawherry,

86« Frozen Veuelrode Puddiner- 

Glace Nesselrode or iced pudding. A frozen cus- 
tard made of pounded chestnuts, with fruit and fla- 
vorings : 

1 pound of large chestnuts— about 40. 

1 pint of rich boiled custard. 

1 cup sweet cream. 

2 ounces citron. 

2 ounces sultana raisins. 

2 ounces stewed pineapple. 

i cupful of maraschino. 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract. 

Pinch of salt in the chestnut pulp. 

Slit the shells of the chestnuts, boil them half an 
hour, peel clean, and pound the nuts to a paste, and 
rub it through a coarse sieve, moistening with 
cream. Then mix it with the boiled custard. Freeze 
this mixture, and when firm whip the cup of cream, 
and stir it in and freeze again. Then add the citron 
cut in shreds, the stewed or candied pineapple, like- 
wise the raisins, maraschino,* and vanilla extract. 
Beat up and freeze again, and either serve in ice 
cream plates out of the freezer, or pack the cream 
in a mold, and when well frozen send to table 
whole, turned out of the mold on to a folded napkin 
on a dish. 

The foregoing makes about enough to fill one of 
those brick • molds that have a large and deep 
stamped fruit pattern in the lid and when frozen 
firm it can be sliced into from 12 to 16 portions. 
When chestnuts are not convenient some of the large 
cafes use the ready prepared pounded almonds or 
walnuts that may be bought by the can at the con- 
fectioners* supply stores, and various additions or 
substitutions of green candied fruits are employed to 
make a handsome appearing compound without 
changing its general character Should be trebled in 
quantity for dinner for fifty.

but crowded out of place.

on about 2 quarts of water, with a lot of sugar in, 
and the pineapple juice, making a hot syrup of it, 
and then pour it to the grated rinds and juice in the 
bowl to draw the flavor. Strain into the freezer,

Cardinal Punch. 



A survival of the old-time spiced wine called 
"bishop;" the same was called cardinal when made 
with the best of red wine. The specialty about it is 
in roasting the oranges either before or over the fire, 
and letting them steep in good red wine, which, when 
thus flavored, is used either hot or cold. If to be 
frozen take 

1 quart of wine jelly (calPs foot or gelatine.) 

1 quart of claret or any good red wine. 

1 quart of port. 

1 quart of water. 

2 pounds of sugar.

Bake the oranges brown on a plate in the oven. 
Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and water with 
the cloves in it, drop the baked oranges into it, add 
the wine and let remain until cold. Cut the oranges 
and press I hem for the juice, and strain the punch 
into the freezer. Add the jelly (or white of eggs for 
a substitute) and freeze. If in season for red rasp- 
berry juice add some for brighter color.

Angelica Punch. 



2 cups California Angelica wine. 

2 cups hot water — a pint. 

1 cup sugar — i pound. 

1 cup stemmed raisins — } pound. 

1 lemon. 

2 whites of eggs and two tabiespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar to beat in. 

Chop the raisins, grate half the rind of the lemon, 
squeeze in all of the juice, pour the hot water to 
them, add the sugar, and stir until it is all dissolved. 
Strain the flavored .<;yrup thus obtained into a 
freezer, and rub the most of the raisin pulp through 
as well. Add the wine and freeze. When nearly 
frozen whip the two whites and the powdered sugar 
together till thick, add them to the punch and finish 
freezing. It is like cream. Serve in stem glns«e<. 



93b. 



Bisque Ice Creams. 



Ice creams with a proportion of the pulp of 
pounded fruit or nuts added are termed bisques, 



93c. Bisque of Pineapple Ice Cream. 

1 can pineapple or } pound. 

2 cups sugar. 
4 cups cream. 

Chop the pineapple small and put it in a bright 
pan or kettle with the sugar and a few spoonfnls of 
juice or water to dissolve the sugar to syrup. Sim- 
mer at the side of the range a short time. 

Whip the cream till it is half froth, then freeze it 
first by itself, because the pineapple added before 
freezing has a tendency to curdle it. Pound the 
phieap])le and syrup through a colander, mix it with 
the partly frozen cream, and freeze again. 

It can and ought to he managed to have the pine- 
apple in syrup prepared beforehand to he cold. In 
making these bisques it is not best to pound the 
fruit perfectly fine, but the small pieces about like 
grains of wheat should be perceptible and show that 
the creams are mixed with fruits and not merely 
flavored. 

98d. Bisque of Preserved Ginger. 

J pound of either preserved or candied ginger. 

i cup sugar. 

Juice of one lemon. 

4 cups of cream. 

Cut the candied ginger into very small pieces. 
Make a hot syrup of the sugar with a few spoonfuls 
of water and squeeze the lemon into it, then put in 
the ginger and let it soften and impart the flavor to 
the syrup. Put the cream and ginger and syrup all 
together, freeze and beat up. 



93c. 



Apricot Ice. 



3 cupfuls of apricots cut in pieces. 

1 cupful of sugar— 8 ounces. 

2 cupfuls of water. 

The kernels of half the apricots. 

2 whites of eg^s. 

The ripest and sweetest apricots, if the fresh fruit 
be used, should be kept out, one cupful to be mixed 
in the ice when finished. 

Slew the other two cupfuls and the peeled kernels 
in the water and sugar for a few minutes, rub 
the fruit then with the back of a spoon, through a 
strainer into the freezer along with the syrup. 
Freeze like ice cream and when it is nearly finished 
whip the two whites to a firm froth, mix them in and 
turn the freezer rapidly a short time longer. Stir in 
the cut apricots just before serving. Canned apri- 
cots can be used as well, and if in syrup that can be 
mixed in also.

enough to make it even and smooth. 

96. Hickory Nut lee Cream. 

1 pound of either pecan or hickory nut kernels. 

12 ouisces of sugar. 

1 quart of rich milk or cream. 

1 tAblespoooftil of burnt sugar coloring. 

Pick over the kernels careAiUy that there be no 
Aragraents of shells to make the cream gritty, then 
pound thf m in a morfar with part of the sugar and 
a few spoonfuls of milk or other fluid. Only a few 
can be pounded eftectoally at a time. Mix the milk 
with the pulp thus obtained, the rest of the sugar 
and caramel coloring enough to make it like coffee 
and cream, and run it through a strainer into the 
freezer. 

Freeze it aa usual and beat smooth with the pad- 
dle, then pack down with more ice to freeze firm.

3 pints of water. 

1 pound of sugar* 

6 or 6 oranges according to size. 

1 lemo.i, juice only, if the oranges are sweet. 

4 whites of e gs. 

Make a thick syrup of the sugar and very little 
water. Peel half the oraagci, divide them each in 
12 or more by pulling apart by the natural divis- 
ions and drop i he pieces of orange in the bailing 
syrup. Grate the yellow zest of the other 3 oran- 
ges into a bowl and squeeze in the juice, then pour 
the syrup ftrom the scalded drange slices a^so irto 
the bowl through a strainer and keep tbe pieces on 
ice to be mixed in at the last. Add the water and 
lemon jr.ice to the orange syrup in the bowl, strain 
and freeze. Beat in the whipped whites as usual 
and when finished stir in the sugared fruit. 

This4ce is cream-white, tinged with the orange 
ze-t and juice. 

Use the burnt almond cream for the outside and 
fill with the orange ice. 

98. Ohooolate Ioe Oream 

Use only 8 or 4 ounces of the common unsweete 
ened chocolate to a gallon of cream or boiled cus- 
tard. Chocolate cream is generally too strongly fla- 
vored for the majority. The foreign vanilla chocolate 
8 >iooui haif sugar ^nd mire of course can be used. 
Boil the chocolate in some niilk with sugar added, 
strain ii into tbe cream and flavor with vanilla be^ 
sides. Beat the ice cream to make it bright and 
rich colored. Melted chocolate cannot be mixed at 
once in cold cream, as it sets and makes trouble, it 
must be considerably diluted first.

very strong clear coffee to 3 quarts. Sugar as usu- 
al — 8 ounces to a quart. The best coffee for this 
purpose is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee 
in cold water over night and not boiling it at all.

Pick out a few of the berries to be mixed in the ice 
at last. Rub the rest through a strainer into the 
freexer with the nyrupani add the water. Freeze 
without much beatinfr if a crimson ice i9 wanted, and 
add coloring if neceft^ary. Throw the reserved ber- 
ries on top of the strawberry ice in the fireeser and 
mix them in when the ice is to be served. 



02. 



Ourrant Ice. 



Make ourrant water ice the same as the strawber- 
ry ice preceding, except that no whole fruit need 
be saved out. Cooked or canned currants are not 
suitable, being too gelatinous and of poor color, and 
only the best and ripest of the fresh fruit s&ould b 
employed for this purpose. The most luscious cur- 
rants do not grow in America. 

103. 

The hotel pastry cook has very little need of arti- 
ficial coloring. The rich colors of the various fruits 
n their season may be preserved with but slight 
^ uble by taking the surp'us juices and boiling 
them with plenty of sugar, often in the same kettle 
the fruit was cooked in for pie ', aud straining the 
syrup into bot'l^s. Such pyrups will keep a long 
time and while ihe writer is well aware that any 
elaborate process of the s^rt would never be put in 
practice in hotel work, he can recommend the 
seizing upon such things as come to hand this way 
as positive labor..saviiig expedients. A bottle of 
strawberry or raspberry syrup put away at an odd 
time comes spiei*didly in place to mix with a flreexer 
of cream in the winter or spring. 

104. Strawberry loe Oream. 

2 quarts of strawberries — red ripe and sweet. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

2 quarts of cream. 

Cover the fruit with the sugar and ma^h them 
together and rub the fruit a >d syrup through a 
seive into a bowl, adding a cupful of waier to the 
pulp at last. 

H If freeze the cream by itself and then add the 
strawberry syrup and finish the freezing as usual. 



105. 



Pineapple loe. 



2 cans of pineapple. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

2 quarts of water 

6 or 8 whites of eggs. 

S'rain the juice Arom the cans into the freezer. 
Make a boiling syrup of the sug<ir and 1 quart of 
water and throw in the pieces of pin«*app1e previously 
CI t in large d*ce. Let b^il a few minutes and then 
strain the flavored synip alpo into the freez<>r. Add 
the other quart of water and freeze. Strew some su- 
gar over the pieces of pineapple and set them on ice. 
When the syrup is nearly frozen add some red fruit 
ju'ce or coloring to make it rose p'nk, aod the 
whipped whites, beat and freeze aga'n. Throw the 
pieces of pineapple on top, cover down and let n- 
main till time to serre, then mix them in. 

The canned pineapple is generally riper and 
sweeter than the fr«sh fruit that iv sent to Northern 
markets. When the latter is used it should be cut 
up. have hot syrup poured over aod allowi^d to i^teep 
till cold. Two cans contain about 1} pounds of 
pineapple. The ju'ce of 1 or 2 lem n« is sometimes 
added to a pineapple ice when the fruit is very 
sweet.

white. 

lOT* Pineapple loe Oream. 

Make the same as directed in the preceding re- 
ceipt with 2 quarts of rich cream instead of water, 
and use no eggs. Pineapple syrup or pulp poured 
in cream will immediately curdle ir. The cream 
must be nearly frozen first and then the pineapple 
added to it and the freezing finished.

free from oil and rancidity is best. 

Make the custard as usual and stir in the cocoa- 
nut while it is still warm after straining. Freeze and 
beat as usual. A little lemon or orange flavoring 
can be added.

1 pound of sugar. 

1 quart of wa'er. 

Juice of one lemon. 

Mith the grapes and sugar together raw, add the 
lemon juioe and water, strain into a freez r with 
all the pulp obtainable, and freeze at once. The ice 
becomes lighter colored the more it is beiteo. The 
lemon juice he'ps to brighten it. The grapes should 
not be scalded or cooked.

"Wild Plum loo. 



As good in its turn as pineapple or lemon. The 
plums must not be cooked, howeyer. 

1 pound of wi'd plums^ripe and sweet, red or 
yellow. 

1 pound of sugar. 

1 quart of water. 

4 whites of eggs. 

Mash the plums and sugar together in a bright 
pan, add the water and rub the pulp and syrup 
through a strainer into a fireezer. Freeze, add the 
the whipped whites and beat up as usual. It makes 
a cream-white ice, that may be colored with a li'tle 
boiled red plum syrup or otherwise. 

Wild plum ice cream of sweet plMBS may also be 
m«de by the directions given for pineapple ice 
cream. The flayer is yery good.

The cook wanted to make a tapioca custard ice 
but the appearance of it on the bill of fare bothered 
him He knew it was good, tor sometimes ihe 
tapioca cup-cus^nrd had become half frozen where 
it was pet in ice to ge' cold, snd it wss extremely rich. 
He knew there was such a thing as iced pudding, 
but then it might be taken to mean only pudding 
iced oyer like cake, »nd besides ired pudding should 
b^ of two parts, cream and fruit. This was at a 
Sulphur Springs down in a warm State where they 
hud ices of some port for dinner eyrery day during 
three-f mrths of the year, and two kinds on Sun. 
diys, and the repeti'ions cf ice cream and lemon 
she- bet became ez'remely tiresome. So he con- 
cluded to put it on the bill of fare froun tapioca 
pudding. But the people who ate the dinners were 
not tired rf ices, and the eating of them had become 
a sort of habit, add to haye lefi out the ices would 
haye seemed as strange as to have left out coffee or 
bread. And when the young colonel, who was al 
ways ready to penetrate a witic^sm remarked sig. 
n^fieantly that if there Was one thing he did loye it 
was ice cream, and if there was one thing he did 
despise it was cold pudding, eyerybody look«^d n 



the bill of f^re, and the young ladies said, oh, dear! 
But the brig dier general S4id ho had half a mirid 
to try it and see what frozei pudding wa% and the 
old lady said he needn't be a bit afraid for eyery- 
hing they made there was good. But while they 
were talking the judge, who was wanted at the 
courthouse asain, had had his brought in, and he 
spoke up and said they couldn't fool him, it was ice 
cream. Then the young ladies said again how very, 
very ridiculous, and they misht bring them a Hi lie, 
please. And it ended badly, for through this nn. 
wonted advertising of the article it gave out and 
there was not over half enough to go round. But, 
begging the judges pardon, it was not ice cream, 
now what was it? 

119. Frozen Tapiooa Oustaxd, 

8 quarts of milk. 
20 ounces of sugar. 

6 or 7 ounces of tapiooa 

2 ounces of butter. 
12 yolks or 8 whole eggs. 

Flav-ring. 

1 cupfril of thick cream to whip in at last* 

The pearl tapioca is the most snitable. If the 
large grained sort is used crush it on the table with 
the rolling-pin and then sift away the dust. 

Steep the tapioca 2 hours in a quart of milk cold, 
but set it in a warm place. Boil the rest of the milk 
with the sugar in it, then add the steeped tapioca, 
cook for 15 minutes. Stir in the butter, then the 
beaten yolks and take the custard immediately off 
the fire, cool, flavor with vanilla or lemon, and 
freeze like ice cream, and when ne%rly finished add 
the cup of cream whipped to a froth, and beat well. 

113. Frozen Rice Oustard. 

Same as the preceding. Wash 6 ounces of rice in 
several waters and cook it in the milk. May be 
flavored with stick cinnamon. If made with rice 
previously cooked pass it tbrough a colander.

For the same purposes as the apples preceding, 
can be prepared in the same way. The object if 
slewing the fruit in thick syrup is to preyent it from 
breaking out of shape. The syrup can then be dilu- 
ted as desired. 



The quantities in all these receipts are calculated 
for the ayerag^ or probable orders of 50 lersons 
haying a yaried bill of ftire to choose from. When 
two ices are to be seryed in combination the quan. 
titles of each of course are reduced in proportion 
A liberal rule is to proyide a quart before freezing 
for eyery 10 persons, and the freezing process should 
increase its yolume considerably.

Lemon Ice. 



8 lemons. 

'8 pounds of sugar. 

8 quarts of water. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Gra'e the rinds of the lemons into a bowl and 
squeeze in the juice. Make a boiling syrup of the 
sug>ir and half the WMter and pour it hot to the 
lemon ze-t and juice and lei remain so till cold-

be used when they are large. The ice is perfectly 
white. 

118. Saratoga Ice Oups. 

For tbe following yery easy method of senring 
ices ornamentally there should be provided a suffi 
dent number of (in drinking cups made like ta>I 
tumbler glasees, to serve as molds. They need have 
no rimmed edge. Iheir slight flexibility makes

Take 4 dozen tumblers and set them in a freezing 
miz'ure o^" ice punded extremely fine and well 
mixed with pali and a little brine from the freezing 
tub. The freezing miiture may be in a common 
washtub, or wooden boa, and no deeper than the 
tumblers. Fill the glasses with thin strawberry, 
pineipple or lemon syrup, or with any of the prep- 
arations for fruit ices. Ck>yer oyer the top of the 



tub with a table doth and le^ve them to freeze. In 
from 16 t'^ 80 minutes the glasses or moulds will 
have a coating of ice inside perhaps an eighth-of-an- 
indi thick. The unfrozen syrup shot -Id then be 
poured out and the glasses returned to the freezing 
mixture for the inside c aiing of ice to freeze per- 
fectly dr^ and crystalized. The freezing mav be 
hastened by gently stirring the freezing mixture 
among tbe tumblers with a stick and by turning the 
tumblers with the fingers. 

When it is time to serve wipe the outside of the 
glass or mold with a cloth dipped in tepid water 
and turn out the shell of ice. Fill it with a curacao 
or caramel or nut ice cream or any ether of differ- 
ent color fhim the cup itself, or with a pure froihed 
cream swee ened and flayored and froztnin the same 
ice cup set in a sorbetiere 

Different colored cups maybe made with the green 
pyrop of pounded muscatel grapes, with Concord 
grapes, cherries, etc. Ob'serye that the less sugar 
these syrups contain the'easier the cup shapes will be 
to freeze and the slower to dissolve. They last longer 
on the table than the iM creams they are filled with. 

Ice cream in shape of eggs : A small number 
for a party table can be made without moulds by 
using eg{ shells of the largest sort. Procure some 
broad rubber bands from the stationers, fuch as are 
used for binding bundles of letter, etc , aud hnlf an

After that fill with chocolate ice. cream or yellow 
frozen custaid. The variations are endless.

A freezing box: It is a simple and easy matter to 
freeze ice orenm in a mold that can haye the lid pu 
on, be sealed and dropped into (he freezing tub from 
which the ice cream freezer has just been remoyed. 
A freezing box inyoWing the use of a larger amount 
of freezing material is, howeyer, indispensable for 
some articles. An empty ice cream ftreezer with the 
lid on, picked around and on top with ice and salt, 
is an example of what is wanted. A glass of cream 
placed inside might be frozen solid in an hour or 
two. But something more spacious can generally be 
improyised, such as a broad and shallow boiler set 
in a tub. The article must haye a lid that will ad- 
mit of ioe and salt being packed all oyer it without 
danger to the contents. 



**Now I haye liyed long enough to know that each 
generation says the same thing, and is laughed at 
for its pains by the generation following." — Savarin 
Preface. 

We haye adhered closely to one of the highest 
principles of the best cook which the present age, or 
perhaps that of Heliogabalus hath produced. This 
gre^t man, as is well known to all loyers of polite 
eating, begios at first by setting plain things before 
his hungry guests, using afterwards by degrees, as 
their s omachs may be supposed to decrease, to the 
yery quintessence of sauce and spices. By these 
means we doubt not but our reader may be rendered 
desirous to read on foreyer, as (he great person just 
aboye mentioned is supposed to haye made persons 
to ^dX:'— Fielding— Preface to Tom ,/oiwi— 1751. 

'<There is no doubt the delicacy of our manners 
could not suffer the Roman practice of using yomi- 
tories, bat we haye done better, and reach the same 



end by a method allowed by good taste. We haye 
inyented dishes fo attractiye that they unceasingly 
renew the appetite ; yet they are at the same time 
so light that they flatter (he palate without loading 
the stomach. We haye orriyed at such a point, thai 
if the calls of business did not force us to rVie from 
the table, or the want of sleep interpose, (he dura« 
tion of our repasts would be almost unlimited ; and 
there would be no fixed data for finding what time 
might elapse between the first glass of Madeira and 
the last tumbler of ^xincW* ^Qasbronomy — 1825. 

"Although this kind of ice is seldom seryed I haye 
thought it best to describe it ; it is just possible 
that, in this transition period, we may see an at- 
tempt made to improve the indififerent quality of 
the refreshments now served at evening parties ; and 
then such delicate preparations as these Iced Froths 
will be in request. They are cool to eat without 
fireeziog the palate; they are perfectly wholesome and 
suited to the weakest digestion." — Julet Chuff e

These ices often appear in the menus of banquets 
served at Delmonico's. They are whipped creams 
variously flavored; the froth is piled in glasses 
which are then set in a f^reezing box where it is al- 
lowed to f^reeze without any manipulation. Double 
cream must be used ; that is cream skimmed fVom 
the top of cream. It should be cold to froth easily. 
Sweeten and flavor it like any ice cream preparation, 
and churn it in a pail with a whip chum, such as 
may be procured at any tinners, or with a Doter 
egg beaier in a shallow bowl; take off the.firoth, 
place it on a fine seive to drain, and when all is 
whipped firm pile it in the glasses it is to be frozen 
and served in. 

Maraschino, chocolate, coffee, strawberry, lemon 
and vanilla creams are suitable but need to be more 
highly flavored than the ordinary ices. 

It will be found a great aid if all the operations 
can be performed in a cold place. 

For the pastry cook who makes sponge cake fire- 
quently, it will remoye the abtrusenees from two or 
three examples following to observe that they are 
nearly the same as lady-finger batter before the flour 
is added.

1 p uiid of sugar. 

1 tfiDa<l oup of water — nearly i pint 

8 yolks of eggs. 

1 pint of double cream. 

2 tablespooufuls of Tanilla extract. 

Make aboiliog syrup of the sugar and water. Beat 
the yor<8 light in a deep bowl, pour the boiling syi^ 
up to them and continue be&ting, with the bowl set 
in ice water, till the mixture U cold and Tery light. 
Whip the cream to f^oth and lightly mix it with the 
other, and add the flayoring. Sift powdered maca- 
roon oyer the rice paper oases, nearly fill them with 
the preparation, powder oyer the tops and set the 
biscuits in the freezing case for 2 or 8 hours. 

The practice so common in Italian and French 
cookery of using syrups of yarying density instead 
of sugar in making numerous other articles, as well 
as their especial yarieties of cakes, is a remnant 
of ancient times, for the Italians and the French 
were fine cooks long before the art of making dry 
crystalized sugar was known. Th^y used syrups 
and hooey,and the handicraft transmitted from father 
to son has not been wholly reyolutionized by the 
newer product.

24 yolks of e^rgs. 

6 whites of eggs. 

2 pounds of Bugar. 

1 pint of water. 

1 pint of kirschenwasser, or half as much maras- 
chino, curacoa, or a little peach brandy. 

Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and wa'er and 
pour it to the yolks preyiously beaten light. Beat the 
mixture till cool, pour it into a freezer and con inue 
beating with the wire egg whisk, turniog the freezer 
with the other hand, (ill it is pretty well frczeo, 
then add the liqueur a little at a time, and then 
the whites of eggs whipped firm. It looks like a 
yery spongy cake. Can be be put in paper oases 
)arge or small, or filled in a frozen charlotte. 

An ther yariety of the foregoing may be made by 
freezi'g 2 quarts of syrup with chocolate dissolyed 
in ii, aod wtien nearly finished add 12 whites of eggs 
whipped light, and beating all together. 

The receipt for fflace a la erenu Napolitaine origi- 
nally promulgated by M. M. Bernard aod Urbain.

s <me thirty years ago, had no reference to the brick

^-approximately a pint of double cream, a pound of 
sugar and a half a pint of water, 16 yolks, and <r^ 
ange flayor, concocted together by the Italian method, 
i. e. the boiling syrup pouredMo the yolks, and the 
mixture beaten up like sponge cake batter, the 
whipped cream incorporated with it, and the li^q^ht 
product frozen quickly.

Neapolitan molds : The^e are in the form of a cigar 
box or briok ; can be made much longer if desired. 
If ordered ttom a tinner h^ye them made with two 
bids and no bottom instead of box.like wi h one lid ; 
let the rim of the lids haye thick wire soldered on 
to rest upon another wire soldered on the box — 
much the Fame as ice cream freezer lids are made. 

Neapolitan is the Eoglish word. Napolitaine is the 
French. These are among the words that break us 
all up with our bills of fEtre. 



190. Neapolitan loes or Ice Oream. 



Prepare three ice creams, or creams and fruit ices 
or sponge ices, of different colors and flayers, and 
fill the mold (already made freezing cold) with them 
in equal layers. This is best done by filling one 
of the lids higher than its rim and leyeling it off, 
then pushing the mold down into it and then adding 
the other two layers as eyenly as possible. Put on 
the top lid, draw half a dozen rubber baods around 
each mold to keep the lids in place, fill the inter- 
stices with butter and then place the molds in the 
freezing tub and coyer them with pounded ice aod salL 
Let them remain 2 or 8 hours to harden. Some re-' 
gard should be bad to the compatibility of flayers 
chosen as, for instance, lemon and chocolate do not 
taste well together, but chocolate and cinnamon and 
yanil a do, aod an aloaond fl<iyored caramel cream is 
suitable with red grape and white cherry ices. 

Ices are said to haye been introduced into France 
from Italy by Ca* herine de Medici.

Collet, a French captain and refugee, made a small 
fortune in New York about the year 1815 by making 
ices and sherbets. Qajb ih^ Chronicler: *<The women 
in particular, never tired of this new pleasure, be- 
ing especially astonished that they could be kept so 
cold at a summer heat of ninety degrees." 

If sherbets have any distinguishing feature in 
their composition at all it is the admixture of jelly, 
either calf's foot or geiatine, recommended by some 
to give smoothness to the drink and substance to

tine in ice cream. Eiiher gelatine dissolved or fin-

According the lexicographers the word punch ia 
derived from East Indian pantsh, five, having refer- 
ence to the five ingredients of punch— water, spirit, 
sugar, lemoos and tea. But that is the old^iMhioned 
puoch to be drunk hot.

Roman punch is Cfsentially a strong and good 
lemonade with rum in it and whipped whites of

orange juice, wine or brandy or maraschino and 
sometimes spices and flavors. These sre not essen. 
tial ingredients but only individual fancies, but it 
results that there is nothing that cooks in hotels 
have to make that there are such various ideas 
about as the composition of Roman punch. Ag in, 
the caterers who have had the privilege of soiling 
the fashions maire other punches **a U Romoine,*' 
which are not Roman punch but are made in 'he

2. To make a more ezpensiye quality of punch 
use good French white wine instead of water, ex- 
cept water enough to dissolye the sugar. Rub the 
orange and lemon zests on lumps of sugar and the 
flayored syrup made with it need not be made hot. 
A larger number of lemons will be needed, and the 
rum is to be added at last as in the other case.

Not dictionary kisses. Uofortanately perhaps for 
the succintness of the following disquisition the dic- 
tionaries describe another kind of kisses which in 
some people's minds may possibly intrude and get 
mixed up with these. But they ought not, for it is 
not likely that the two varieties haye any qualities 
in common These kisses that we are going to tell 
you how to make are soft, tender, sweet, fragile, 
round, plump, smooth, delicate, nice, light, and they 
are hollow. That is to say, they should be so if per. 
fecLly well made, but some people go on trying all 
their lives and never prodice a perfect kiss. On 
second thoughts, fir fear of the idea of the diction, 
ary kiss perhaps we had betit^r cill these trifles by 
their FroLoh names. And you may find one of them 
if you will look in Mr. Thaokerty^s book, Pendennts. 
It must be about the middle of the first volume and 
can easily be found because the French words are in 
italics. Mr. P. comes to CUvering Hall and he 
finds the Claverings* young-one sittiug on the carpet 
with his fnce smeared all over < with the species of 
lather con'ained in the confec ion called meringvea a 
la crtme,^* That is one sort. Those are our egg 
kisses filled with whipped cream So of course they 
have to be made hollow, aod tew beside first-rate 
workmen o«(n make them so. But there are numer. 
0U4 rf,r\eti^3 of the kiss-meriogue, and they that can 
ni*>k^ them Mie generally proud of iheir knowledge*

Now p'eoty of people will make oke ioingand drop 
lumps of it ( n pans or on paper and bake them and 
call them kie^es or meringues; hftrd, rough and 
cracked open little lumps <f f-ugar as th^^y are, 
and many a country baker exhibits the same thing 
in his window, nt>Yer seeming to know that there is 
a trick and touch beyond that, with the same mate- 
rial, that makes the meringue swell and round itself 
like the top of a muahro ^m, into a shell as thin as 
paper — the meringues and finger macaroons of the 
^ne COD fee ionaries. There are measures and rules 
fur these, and the finest are easy enough when one 
knows how. 

Theee are trifles of course not to be compared with 
the importance of making good bread and puddings, 
yet if one makes such •'pretties" at ail they should 
be in the highest degree -excellent. We have found 
ornl instructions always useless to the many who have 
tried to make fine meringues. The cook-books give 
a dry formula and leaye you to hit or miss as it may 
hvppen. Therefore we shall be particular to explain 
all the trick there is about them, believing that at 
any rate printed words may be quite as good as 
actual exumples for intelligent readers, who can refer 
to them again if necessary. 



138. 



Merinffue Paste. 



This in yarious f ami h^s had to be mentioned 
often in these columns. It is always white of egg 
and sugar, but is sometimes soft meringue as on 
lemon pies, and sometimes nearly all sugar as in 
cake icing and ''kisses." 

139. Merinerues a la Orexne. 



These are made in two different ways, the first 
makes peihaps the finest and smoothest glazed mer- 
ingue resembling frosted glass, but the paste must 
be used immediately as it soon becomes too thin to 
keep shape. 

1 pound of powdered sugar. 
10 whites of eggp. 

1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of flaToriog extract. 

Have eTcry thing cold and dry to begin with. Whip 
the white of eggs in a deep bowl with a whisk made 
of a bunch of wires, till it will not fall out when 
turned upside down, add the sugar and flavoring all 
at once and stir it in just enough to mix it well and 
no more. Have ready some strips of writing paper 
two inches wide and pieces of boards (not pine) to 
bake the meringues on. Place spoonfuls egg- 
shaped on the stiips of paper, not too close, smooth 
them with a knife, sift powdered sugar all over them, 
shake off the surplus, place the strips on the boards 
and dry-bake them with the oven door partly open. 
They need tp bake nearly or quite half an hour 



They can be lifted off the paper when cold. The 
boards prevent a crust forming on the bottom and 
the soft remainder inside can be scooped out. Fill 
as directed in the next receipt. 

140. 

Meiinffue PufDs—An Easier "Way. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Flavoring extract. 

3 drops of acetic acid, or a pinch of tartaric, or a 
little lemon juice. 

Put half the whites in a bowl without beating, 
and all the sug<ir with them and beat together with 
a wooden spoon or paddle. It m^y save half the 
labor and iuRures success to have all the utensils and 
ingredients quite cold to begin with. It quickens 
the process if the beating can be done with two pad- 
dles, using both hands as regular workmen do. The 
bowl should be a deep one holdiog two quarts. 

The sugar and egg at first are as stiff as dough. 
Beat rapidly and constantly for about 15 minutes, 
when it should be white and rather firm cake idng. 
Now aid the remaining 4 whites of egg, one at a 
time, and beat a few minutes between each one, but 
before the last one is added put in the add and 
the fiavoring. 

The whole time of beating is about 25 minutes. 
An essential point is to beat the icing after the addi- 
tion of each ^hite until it will again draw up in 
peaks after the paddle is lifted from it, except the 
last white which should not be beaten much as it 
forms the gloss and smoothness on the meringues 
when they are baked. 

Drop this meringue paste in egg shapes on baking 
panf instead of on paper as in the last receipt, and 
these being made with granulated sugar instead of 
powdered do not need any Eugar sifted over, they 
look better without. 

Bake in a very slow oven till pale straw color and 
dry. They slip from the pans easily when cold. 

Gut out the thin bottom crusts with a penknifei 
and fill the meringues with whipped cream sweet, 
ened and flavored, or with wine jelly, and either 
pldce two together by ibe bottoms or join them 
two together side by side with melted candy 
or icing, like an open walnut shell, and pile wipped 
cream or chopped jelly upon them. These mer- 
ingues likewise look well singly as cups fliled with 
bright jellies of different colors and with ice creams. 



Instead of placing the meringue paste on the pans 
with spoon and knife it is much better to use the 
sack and tube, such as lady-fingers are made with 
— a funnel shaped canvas bag with a tin tube in the 
pointed end, the tube about } inch in diameter at 
the narrow end for these. Fill the sack with the 
ptiste and press it out in the size and shape desired. 



THE AlCEBIOAN PASTBT COOK. 



141. Rose MerlDffue Pufb 

H'lving m«de the meriDgae fft^te aooirding to the 
preceding directions, color it, or a part of it, of a 
delicate pink and flavor wi'h rose eztrsot. Drop 
with the pack and tube pieces like large marbles on 
baking pans preTiously greased and then wiped dry, 
and bake slowly without color These rise rounded 
and nearly hollow and have a gauzy appearance 
when rightly baked. 



8 innelinies th<> first panful of any of these yarie- 
(ies put into the range will run together and melt 
and come out worttiless. and the next come out 
perfi'ct meringues, or one side of a pan will be 
spoiled and the remainder good. This shows that 
the baking is the critical p«rt of the making, and 
' that is what we never can te^ch by word of mouth. 
At a certain gen<le he«t the egg in the meringues 
cooks and dries in shape, but at a h<gher degree the 
sugar melts and runs to candy in bubbles. At an 
insufficient degree of heat the meringue dries as it 
would in the sun and does not swell and change its 
appeftrance. In the brick oven after the bread has 
been withdrawn is the proper place to bake mer- 
ingues. 

149. Ohocolate Merinflfue Pu£D9. 



There is nothing of the kind choicer or more 
fragile than these. Only a slight change in the 
ingredients from the foregoing yarieties. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 
6 whiles of eggs. 

8 ounces of grated common chocolate— a heaping 
cupful 
8 drops ot acetic acid. 

2 teaapoonfuls of vanilla extract. 

Beat up the icing as directed for meringue puffs, 
using 6 whites instead of 8. and when it is finished 
mix in the chocolate thorougily. Drop round por- 
tions with the sack and tube on baking pans and 
bake at a very gentle heat These rise rounded 
like a mushroom, and nearly hollow. They slip 
from the pans ea-ily when cold. 



143, Alxnond Meringue PiifOs. 

T-ike some of the white icing as made for mer- 
ingue puffs, drop round portions like large marbles 
o t baking pans and stick 6 or 6 halves of almonds 
that have been blanched and split, in each one, in 
circular order, and bake carefully. 



144. Ooooanut Maoaroons. 

Make the white i3ing or meringue paste as directed 
for meringue puffs and add to it when finishf'd 8 
ouncef of desicoAted cocoanut. Drop pieces size of 
walnu s vi h a 00 on and knife point, on greased 
biikin : pans and bake in a very slack oven. These 



favorites for the cake baskets The HugHred kind 
of desiccated cocoanut is the best to use. C«re 
should be taken to have the icing well made a d 
firm before adding it, for no additions of flour or 
starch will do any good if the icing is inoUned to 
run in the first place. And too much care cannot 
be taken with the baking. Let the macaroons re- 
main on the pans till cold 

145. Almond Rings and Finffera. 



Make the same »s the preceding with 8 ounces of 
blanched almonds m'mced very small. Put a smaller 
tube in the forcing sack, and form finger shapes and 
rings of the almond mcingne paste on baking pans, 
and bake them in a very slack ov<>n. These sll bake 
light and nearly hollow and have a fine glazed sur. 
f ce. 

The foregoing varieties, which c%n all be made 
out of one large bowl of meringue paste, form a hand- 
some assortment for the cake stands, to build pyra 
mids, to place around glass bowls of fruit, to deco- 
rate cakes and to fill icing or nougat basket! with. 



140. 



Ck>m2non Macaroons. 



12 ounct's of almonds. 

8 ounces of granulated sugar. 

4 ounces of flour. 

4 eggs. Pinch of salt. 

Crush the almonds without taking off the skins, 
with a rolling.pin upon the table. Mix them and 
the sugar and flour together in a bowl. Drop the 
eggs in the middle and mix the whole into a rather 
soft dough. T'lnce in lumps size rf cherries' on 
baking pans very sligl.'t'y greased. Bake in a slack 
oven light brown. A few bitter almonds or peach 
kernels mixed in improves them. 



14 Y« Meringrue Oakes in Gheneral. 

Make white icing or meringue paste according to 
directions in preceding articles and add two more 
whites to thin it Color some of it and leave some 
white. Spread it over sheets of any sort of cake, or 
on small cakes and bake in a very slack ov^n with 
something under the cakes to keep them from too 
much baking at bottom. Granulated sugar may be 
sifted over the top before baking, or colored sugar 
sand on the white. 

148. About EffffS and "Rgg Beating. 

One of the very first cook-books I ever picked up 
cautioned the reader not to stop beating the eggs 
that were once commenced, because they would go 
down **aod no human power can whip them up 
light again.*' The statement is altogether erroneous 
and a very mischievous one for the clafrS of learners 



THE AKEBICAN PASTBY COOK.

who are always seeking excuses for bad work. And 
it went on to say, **and sometimes they cannot be 
whipped to perfect lightness at all In that case 
you should procure some firesher eggs," eto. 

Hotel work ad mi's of no apologies, and when the 
steward and cooks plan the dinner they cannot affori 
to make the appearance of a dish contingent upon 
the caprice of a dozen of eggs, whether they will 
choose to come up light br not. 

The ease or difficulty of beating up eggs, mmogue, 
icing, sponge cake and the rest depends upon the 
degree of density or viscidity of the eggs or the white 
of eggs, and that often depends upon the tempera- 
ture; they are thicker when old, and when xrarm 
the white of eggs sometimes becomes so thin as to 
haye no more power t) hold the air babbles beaten 
into it than so much water. 

Only last winter a man who had worked with me 
was boarding at a small hotel and happened in the 
bar room when some men who couldn't were try- 
ing to beat up the eggs for the Ohri<tmas egg nogg. 
They had the eggs in a tin pail and sat by the stoYS 
taking spells with each other and beating for all 
that was out, without the least sign of success. As 
soon as the man saw what was the matter he took 
the pail, went outside and set it on the snow, and 
in ten minutes h<)d succeeded in conTcrting the 
eggs into a pailful of foam, and the men who couldn't 
allowed that it was a little trick worth knowing. 

Sometimes the eggs can be beaten up quite as 
easily when warm, but that is when they haye lost 
part of the water they contain by eyaporation, as 
even eggs in the shell will do in dry weather, and 
thus become as thick as if made cold. 



140. 



Dried Bffgrs. 



White of eggs poured thinly on platters soon 
eyaporates and becomes a powder like pulyerized 
glass. This is easily soluble, eyen to the touch of a 
moist finger, can be kept a long time dry and then 
dissolved in water and used as well as fresh. If the 
powder obtained from two cups of white of eggs be 
dissolved iu only one cup of water it can be beaten 
to ftoth for icing, etc., in a minute or two whether 
warm or cold. That is the result of condensation. 
The yolks of eggs dried alone are not soluble but 
the entire egg beaten together and dried slowly in 
water, and more rapidly if mixed with sugar before 
drying.

The varieties of macaroons ''kisses" and meringues 

that might be given would fill several columns, but 
there is no need Scores of things of this class 
with imposing names are but the variations played 
upon the foundation of a few simple and well known 
combinations. Any one who has made perfectly the 
few varieties we have described can easily discover 
new changes for himself. The proportion of minced 



almonds in the white macaroons may be doubled ; 
meringues baked on boards may be made extremely 
small, placed two together with a spot of apricot 
Jam inclosed ; some may be dredged while still moist 
before baking with chopped pistAcbio nu<p, etc., etc. 
These things are not needed by name to vtv the 
hotel bill of fare as some other things that we have 
to do with are, but are always bunched together as 
assorted cakes, small cakes or cakes and confection, 
eries. The following summary will have meaning 
for those who may have essayed the making of 
meringuet a la creme, or macaroons, and failed. 

1 pound of sugar and 4 whites of eggs beaten 
with a paddle till light — about } an hour— makes a 
stiff cake icing and bakes hard and solid in the shape 
it is dropped on the pan. 1 pound of sugar and 6 
whites makes soft or finishing icing, and bakes in 
meringues that are partly hollow but still dry and 
hard, rattling together like walnuts. 1 pound and 
8 whites makes the thin and fragile meringue we 
have described and the finer qualities of macaroons, 
and when the paste beats up easily, as is the case 
when the conditions are right, another white may be 
added with advantage. 

For twelve whites to a ponnd whip the whites with 
a wire egg whisk at first. 

The acetic acid should be added to the icing only 
when it is nearly finished. Its efifoct in whitening 
and stiffening the icing will be seen at once. 

The common trouble in making icing or meringue 
paste is its tendency to run out of shape and drip off 
the cakes covered with it. This cannot be remedied 
by the addition of more sugar, which indeed only 
increases the trouble, but must be prevented by care 
in the beginning, by haring the ingrredients cold and 
not damp and by using enough sagar to the eggs at 
starting to make a stiff dough that can hardly be 
stirred, but will get thinner as the sugar dissolves, 
and the beating done must be rapid beating, not 
stirring around. Granulated sugar can be made into 
meringues or icing with more ease and certainty 
than powdered sugar. 

The annexed are candies but match well the mer« 
ingues and macaroons, with the drawback, however, 
of being solid sugar and costlier, for their size than 
the articles of their list. These caramels sell well in 
the shops. 

Ck>ooanut Oaramels, White and Bed.

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

8 ounces of desiccated cocoanut. 

A small half cupful of water.

Set the sugar and water over the fire in a small 
bright kettle and boil about 5 minutes, or till the 
syrup bubbles up thick and ropes from the spoon, 
aod do not stir it. Then put in the cocoanut, stir to

mix, and begia at once and drop the candy by table 
spoonfala oq a battered baking pan. Reeerye a fe«r 
spoonfiilSy make it hot again and color with cochineal 
and thin with a upoonful of water. Drop a spot of 
the red on each of the white c%ramels. Should the 
candy become set in the kettle before all is used it 
mfiy be dissoWed by adding a spoonful of water and 
setting it on the range again. When fresh grated 
cocoanut is used the sug«r needs to be boiled to the 
candy point, or 3 or 4 minutes longer. 

The yolk of an egg may be mixed with a portion 
of the c^ndy instead of red coloring as aboye to 
make a yellow color, and melted chocolate added for 
another yaricy. 

152. 

We set out white cakes, fruit cakes, pound and 

yeast raised cakes, but if we may judge by the cri 
terion of the quantity used where people have free 
choice, sponge cahe and the numerous yarieties 
firom the same mixture, all made without butter, 
hold the first place as fAyorites. Italian cakes is the 
general term for the class ; diet bread cake is the 
fanciful name for sponge cake sometimes found in 
old-time cook> books. The loaf cakes of this sort* 
whether large or email, are not so good when stale, 
and in some large confectionaries haying reputations 
to keep up, it is made a rule neyer to sell any oyer 
a day old oyer the counter, but such stock is disposed 
of at a reduced rate to small dealers. 

The good qaaliiy ot all these yarieties depends 
upon the same precautions being obseryed as in the 
case of meringues and macaroons, just fully ex. 
plained in the presediog columos. 

153, 

Lady Fingrers or Naples Biscuits. 

8 ounces of powdered sugar. 
Quarter cupf^ of water — } gill. 

9 eggs. 

10 ounces of flour. 

Separate the egg«, the whites from the yolks, and 
set the whites on ice in a large bowl. Haye the 
flour also in a cold place. 

Put the su ?ar and water in a deep bright saucepan 
oyer the fire, add the yolks of the eggs and beat 
with a wire egg whisk till the mix'ure is warm but 
not hot — 5 minutes Then set the pancepaa in a 
pan of cold water, and continue beating 15 minutes 
more till the mixture is become cold, thiok and 
whitish and twice its original bulk. Whip the whites 
to a firm froth that will not fall out of the bowl up 
side down, and mix them lightly wi h the other and 
then Rtir in the flour, also without beating, and only 
stirred with a spoon sufficiently to hide it from 
light. 

Ttie aboye receipt is well worth learning as it is 
good for a great yariety of Italian cakes and will 
not haye to be repea'ed here, except m we shall 
show another «ay of doing the same thing. 



To form the lady.fingers put some of the batter 
into the forcing sack haying a tin tube in it from a 
quarter to half an inch in diameter, and force it out 
in finger lengths on sheets of b^ank paper, with an 
inch of space between each one Sift powdered 
sugar plentifiilly all oyer them. Take hold of two 
comers of the sheet of paper (which may be of half 
newspaper sise) and shake off the surplus sugar on 
to the table, and lay the sheet of cakes on a baking 
pan placed ready? Bake 8 or 10 minutes in a mod- 
erate oyen, allowing the cakes to become no more 
than deep straw color. 

To get the lady-fiogers oft the p%per it is necessary 
to lay the sheet, cakes downwards, on a table and 
brush the paper oyer with yrater. The cakes will 
then peel off. Place them two together. The mois- 
ture will cause them to adhere. 

154. 

Assorted Italian Oakes— Six Ways* 

1. Sponge drops: Proceed as for lady-fingers and 
drop the batter on paper in round shape, large or 
small; according to &ncy. 

2. Place flat sponge drops by twos together with 
jelly spread between, or lemon or orange paste. 

8. Haye ready a lot of sponge drops. Make two 
or more colore and flayers of boiled icing or glaie, 
(directions for making which haye already been 
giyen,) and dip the bottom of each cake, holding it 
on a fork, then set the cakes on baking pans to dry. 

4. Instead of dipping the bottoms let the tops of 
the sponge drops receive the icing, and when dry 
place them by twos together of different colors of 
glaze with yellow orange paste or conserye between 
them. 

5. Haye some finely minced almonds, pistachios, 
hickory nuts, or desiccated cocoanut ready and mix 
with the batter after the manner of macaroons and 
dredge granulated sugar oyer the cakes instead of 
powdered before baking. 

6. Instead of mixing the minced almonds in the 
batter mingle powdered sugar with it and dredge it 
oyer the moist tops of the cakes before baking. 

155, 

Small Savoy Oakes or Savoy Bisouits. 

Make the same batter as for lady-fingers and 
flnvor it with yanilla. Bake it either in small psper 
oaFcs made oi writing paper, or in jem or patty pans 
fas'ened together by the dozen. Prepare the oases 
or pans by brushing them over with clear melted 
but* er and shaking powdered sugar about in them 
instead of flour as with other c%ke«, and sift powd- 
ered sugar oyer the tops of the cakes before baking. 
These cakes bake quickly and should be light col- 
ored. 

150. Savoy Oake» Larsre. 

The same as the preceding, baked in a large or 
fancy shaped mold coated with powdered sugar; 
powdered sugar also sifted on top of the cake form- 
ing a glazed surface when baked.

When we oome to examine thoroaghly the most 
anthoritatiTe, the most noted and the oosrliest works 
on cookery extant, and to sift their methods and 
directions in the full light of a lifetime's working 
experience in ord r to discoyer the simple princi- 
ples tfaat mast underlie eyery sucoessfhl method a 
good deal is reyealed that looks like charlatanry and 
owlish pretense. 

In this little matter of Italian cakes, to 9ook at 
the imposing lists of yarieties, each with its name, 
its own set of weights and proportions and mode of 
proo.dure, one would think it would take about a 
cectury to learn them all, but when we know in ad- 
yanoe that eyery one must rest upon the simple 
sponge cake mixture howeyer well disguised we are 
acquainted with the whole of them already. The 
standard sponge cake mixture, as it may fairly be 
called, is 1 pound of sugar, 12 eggs and 12 ou oes 
of flour. The nature of the ingredients will not 
admit of a deyiation of oyer an ounce or two. But 
if in writing a receipt we designate say three-fifths 
of these proportions of each article, and for the next 
yariety two-fifths or two-thirds or one-half, the only 
difference in result will be in the number of cake^ 
produced, but the unfamiliar weights aod numbers 
make it appear on the surface as if each yariety had 
an entirely different composition. 

The work thst the head of either culinary depart- 
ment of a hotel can actually do with his own hands 
must be but a small portion of the whole, and how. 
oyer skillful he may be he must be largely dependent 
upon his assistants for the general excellence of his 
department But these assistants cannot know and 
are not expected to leirn a different formula for 
eyery different thing they are required to make. Th' 
head man will get the more help fh>m those working 
under him the more he can simplify' the processes 
he giyes them to carry out 

The receipt already giye n undei the head of Naples 
biscuits is a good one, but it is only spo ge cake 
mixture at last, and there is a simpler way that may 
be intrusted to the boys with perfect safety to make 
all the yarieties of Italian cakes th%t are at all neces 
sary or desirable, and that is only to make common 
sponge cake batter in a plain and common way. ' 



15Y. 



Sponffe Oake. 



14 ounces of sugar. 

12 eggs 

12 ounces of fiour. 

Put the eggs aod sugar together in a kettle, tin 
pail, or deep pan, set in a yessel of ice water and 
beat the mixture rapidly f -r half an hour by the 
clock Then lightly stir in the flour. If the beat- 
ing be frtithful y performed this spooge cake batter 
can be used to make lady-fingers, sayoy cikes, plain 
unglszed epooge cakes, Jelly rolls and the ha^f dozen 
yarieties of Italian small c%kes already described. 



One day one of my boys showed me such an assort, 
moot as the aboye all made out of a kettle of spooge 
cake batter 4 times the quantity of the receipt, and 
whea they haye been approyed, with a sly look he 
said: *' But I was late and only beat the eggs and 
sug4r 20 minutes.*' 

'* Tour ingredients were in good condition and the 
atmosphere is dry and cold. There are exceptions 
to eyery rule, but yor. must work by the rule and not 
the excepti ^n. Besides there is a good deal in 
knowing how to beat effectively." 

158. Butter Sponge Oake. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

10 eggs. 

8 or 10 ounces of butter. 

1 cupful of milk—} pint. 

2 teaspoonfhls of baking powder. 
1} pounds of flour. 

Beat the sug«r and eggi together a few minotee 
AS if for sponge cake, melt the butter and beat it in, 
add the milk, then the powder and then the flour 
and stir up we I. Flayor if desired. 

If I had to lose the knowledge of all kinds of cakes 
but one I should choose the aboye. It is oompara- 
tiyety cheap; when fresh it is as good as any, and 
answers more purposes than any other mixture 
made. In the exigencies that oflea overtake us when 
the hotel busioess is good, I have frequently begun 
when the doors were just opened for dinner, and 
had large sheets of this light oake 1 or 2 inches 
I hick aod nicely glased with sugar baked on top 
retidy to send in when the plates were changed 
either a^ padding or cake— about 26 minutes from 
the time of beginning—whicli could not be done 
with uny richer mixture. 

159. White Butter Sponge Oake. 

The same as the preceding made with the surplus 
white of eggs often left over from salad making, etc. 
iJse 1 pound of whites instead of the 10 eggs and 
add an ounce more butter. 

It makes jelly oikes; may have raisins or currants 
mixed in, and if made cold enough to keep shape 
m%kes very fair sp'>nge drops or other small cakes. 
It is the best also for the following. 

160. 

Oream Oake or '^'Washlnffton Pie " 

Bake the butter sponge cake on jelly cake pans, 
quite thin, and place two sheets togerher with pastry 
cream thickly spread between. The pastry cream is 
the same that is used to fill oream pufls, which see 
or index. 

lOl. Oom Staroh Blano Man^e.

dissoWed, but do not let it boil lest the milk curdle. 
Strain it into a pan and set away to cool. After it 
has oooltd (tir in the flayoriog — lemon, Taoilia, al. 
mond, cinnamon or anj other — and the cup of cream. 
Pour it itito molds or custard cups, or an iDch deep 
in milk pans, to be cut when set, in squares or dia- 
monds and seryed with cream ir diluted fruit jelly. 

The foregoing is the basis of eeyeral kinds of 
creams to be desoribvd farther on, and will be re- 
ferred to and not repeated 

A useAil rule to keep in mind is — 1| ounces of 
gelatine to a quart of water for Jelly, etc., but 1 
ounce only to a quart of milk. 

Cooper's sheet gelatine sells at about half the price 
of the imported kinds; it is tasteless and as good as 
any except that is liable to curdle the milk on a3tual 
boiling. The transparent ge'atines or isinglass, on 
the other hand, are as liable to bum on the bottom 
and are troublesome to dlssolye. 

165. 

Ctondensinff Milk for Blano*Manff era and 
Oreaxns. 

Skimmed milk which is superabundant in many 
hotels can be immensely improYod for the pastry 
cook's purposes by condensation. N9 process is re< 
quired but to set 4 quarts of milk on the range in a 
shallow pan with the sugar in it that is required for 
2 quarts — probably 12 ounces — and let the milk sim. 
mer till reduced to 2 quirts. The cheesy coating 
that forma on boiling milk will not appear on that 
which has sugar in it. 



6 ounces of corn starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

A pinch of salt. FlaToriog. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it. Mix ]lhe starch 
with the extra cup of milk, stir it in and let cook 
a few minutes. Take from the fire, be it in the but- 
ter to whifen it, flayor, and put the blatc mange 
immediately into custard cups preyiously wet with 
water. When cold take Ifbut of the cups and serve 
eitherwi'h a little bweetened cream, or iruit, or fruit 
jelly. Instead of cups it may be spread in bright 
pans, cut in square blocks and served with the 
smooth bjttom bide up.

Com Starch Jelly. 



This can be very nice when nicely made ; If act 
made sour and harsh wirh too much lemon nor Iiard 
and opaque with too much starch. 

1 quart of water and a half pint OTer. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

1 small lemon. 

8 ouDCs of com starch — 8 heaping tablespoonftils. 

Boil the water with the sugar in it and add to it 
the juice of the lemon and about half the rind 
shnyed off tbin and cut in small pieces. Mix the 
starch witb the extra enp of water, stir it into the 
boiling syrup and let boil slowly for about 10 min- 
utes to lose its milky appearance and become almost 
cle-ir. Pour it into custard cups or any kind of 
molds. Serve in saucers with a spoonful 0% «iweet- 
ened cream whipped to flroth. This Jelly looks bet^ 
ter if colored either with burnt sugar or like the 
following kind. 



103. 



Tapioca Jelly. 



1 quart of raspberry or other firuit Juioe strained. 

1 cupful of water. 
12 ounces of sugar. 
4 oances of tapioca. 

Crush the tapioca, if the large kind, by rolling at, 
and Sleep it 2 hours in the water and some of the 
fhiit Juice. Boil the rest of the raspberry iuioe 
with the sugar in it, ad>i the 6teepe<{ tapioca and let 
simmer 15 minutes or more. Put it in cups or othef 
molds atd serve it cold with a spoonfUl of 'roTk of' 
egg custard in the siucer, or With whipped oream. 
This can a' so be mide with water and flavorings, as 
directed for corn surch jelly. 

104, Gelatine Blanc Mange. 

2 quarts of ricl) milk. 
12 ounces of sugnr. 

2 ounces of gelatine. 

Flavorings. 

1 small cupful of cream to whiten it^ 

Set the milk over the fire in a bright kettle with 
the sugar and gelatine in it, and etir them occasion- 
ally with a wire egg beater till the gelatine is all 



106. 



Jaune Mange. 



The blanc mange of the preceding receipt with 6 
yolks of eggs beaten in after tbe gelatine is discolved 
and just before taking from the fire. 

Divide the blano mange and color only hall of if 
yellow with 8 or 4 yolks, and thus have two colore 
cut in small blocks to serve in the same aittoers. 
Jaune is yellow, as blane is white. 

lOT* Almond Oream Blanc Mange. 

X pound of sweet almonds. 

2 ounces of bitter almonds or peach keniela. 

1 pound of sug-ir. 

1 quart of cold water. 

2 ( unces of gelatine. 

1 small cupfhl of cream. 

Boil the almonds 2 minutes, then fake off^ the skins 
and pound them a few at a time in a mortar, adding 
a little sugar and a spoonful of water occasionally. 
Put the almond paste in a bowl with the rest of the 
sugar and water and let steep a while. Dissolve 
the gelatine in a little warm water, add it to the 
milk.of-almonds, the cup of cream likewise and 
strain through a napkin with pressure. Set the 
blanc mange in molds on ice.

168. Floatingr Islands. 

^^ good general bill of fare name for a number ot 
usefal trifles ooid for dessert that are alike only in 
being sometbiog afloat in a sauce. 

1. "Whipped Syllabub" or '•Trifle:" An orna- 
mental bowl of whipped cream flayored with wioe, 
with a c«ke in it. 

8 pints of sweet cream. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

1 cupful of madeira or raisin wine 

2 thin jelly cakes size of saucers. 

Put the jelly cakes in 2 glass bow's Whip the 
sweet med and flavored cream with a whip— churn 
till half of it is froth« Pour the fluid portion ioto 
the bowls, pile the froth on top, and drop spots of 
red jelly or of cream, colored before churning, all 
OTf r the snrf'ice—* 'Missis Jane" will dip it out wi'h 
a siWer ladle, at the head of the table 

2. Italian cakes spread with jelly floatiog in 
wioe custard, with whipped cream on top. 

2 quarts (f boiled custard fltvortd with a cupful 
of maraschino. 

40 or 50 sponge drops spread with jelly. 

1 cupful of thick cream. 

Make the sponge drops as directed for lady^fingere, 
with a isp si'gar cnating on top Spread jelly on 
the bottoms and drop them, with the jelly side 
uppermost, in saucers nearly filled with the martis* 
chiuo costard. Whip the cream a little at a time as 
wanted f r filling tie orders and place a spoonful on 
each float as they are sent in. 

8. The preceding kind can be made cheaper with 
plain boiled custard and thin sheets of cake out in 
small squares. All the varieties must be very cold 
to be good 

4. Place 4 or more lady-fingers, niade small for 
the purpose and not doubled two together, ends 
downwHrdi in jePy glasses, and pile upon ihem some 
wine flavored whipped cream. 

5. Snow Eggs. Eggs a la Neige. Snow Ballti: 
12 whites of eggs. 

1 or 2 ounces of granulated sugar. 

Flavoring. 

1 quart of rick yolk-of-egg custard cold. Have a 
pan of boiling milk and wter ready in the oven. 
Let the whites of eggs be cold to begin with. Whip 
them firm, add the sugar, then drop egg shaped por- 
tions with a wet spoon into the boiling milk and 
water, and let them cook fk few minutes with the 
oven door open. They may either be turned over 
with a skimmer when half done or allowed to acq'iir * 
some color on top like other meringues. If conked 
too long these will shrink to almost nothing. Too 
much sugar likewise will spoil them. Serve them 
cold in a saucer of custird. These egg floats are 
very old favorites They may be variously flavored, 
and may have an ounce of melted common chocolate 



mixed with the whites while beating to make olioso- 
late float. 

6. Ma'fe 2 quarts of boiled custard, set in the 
oven, after letting it cool a little, and drop meringue, 
the same that is spread over lemon pies, by spoonfuls 
all over the top Let the merii gue d'y bake with 
the oven do->r open 6 or 8 minuti s, then set the pan 
away to get cold before serving. Dish up custard 
and a spoonful of the meriogue in saucers. Care is 
required not to let the custard cook too much while 
the meringue is baking. The pan may be set in 
another pan of water not boiling. 

160. Snow Float. 

Snow Pudding. Lemon Snow. Lemon Sponge. 
Mont Blanc, etc , etc , or Russian Jelly. 

2 qiarts of water. 

4 ounces scant of gelatine. 

2 pounds of sugar 

6 lemons— juice of all, rinds of 2 or 8. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Qrate the lemon rinds and squeeze the juice into 
the sugar ia a kettle, add the water and gelatine, set 
the kettle ov»r the fire and beat the cjntents fre- 
quently till the gela'ine is all 'dissolved, which will 
be at about the bjilirg point. Strain it into an ice 
cream freezer cr other vessel set in ice water, and 
when the jelly has become nearly cold beat it with 
a wire egg whisk till frothy a d almost whi e. Then 
whip the whites of eggs firm, stir them in and beat 
the whole again till it is set, when it wih be like 
snow. 

Make a yellow custard with n quart of milk, 8 
yolks and 4 ounces of sugar, and flavor, and serve 
it in the saucers with a spuonful of the fljat, ice 
cold. 



Articles like the foregoing come in serviceably 
when, as so often happens there is no milk to be had, 
for even the custards to go with them can be made 
with water. 

Fur a yellow variety ot the Russian jelly or gela- 
tine fljut, when it is just at the boiling point stir in 
the yolks of 8 or 10 eggs quickly and uke the jelly 
from the fire immediately before i hey become cooked. 
Fuvor with lemon extract if necessary and beat it 
up without the addition of white of egg*. 

Race ginger boiled in the jelly makes another 
kind. It shou.d be colored with burnt sugar and 
beaten up like the snow float. 

Lemon juice more or less is essential in them ali 
to correct the taste of gelatine. 

A spoonful of whipped cream can be served with 
I he floats instead of custard.. 

Snow float that is left over is all ready to be boiled 
and run through the jelly bag to make wioe jelly of 
the clearest for the next day. The white of egg in 
it clarifies it and then its strained out.

THE AKEBICAN PA8TBT COOK. 



Why do fifteen ftmilies, samberiog BeTenty-fiye 
8oul8, have fifteen very poor cooks preparing fifteen 
very poor dioners over fifteen different fires when, 
if they were all together, two skillful cooks with a 
helper and a man in the yard and two fires o>u!d 
prepfure a most excellent dinner at less cost for them 
all? 

170. Fruit Jelly Floats- 



Good firm jellies of fruits can be beaten partially 
light after the manner of the gelatine kinds pre- 
ceding, and whipped whites of eggs o%n be beaten in 
as a finish. Take qnino% pe«oh, currant, or other 
Jelly that is hard enough to cut with a knife and 
warm it sufficiently to beU. Set the bowl cont^n- 
ing it in a pan of ice water t;o cool it while beating, 
and to i pint of jelly allow } pound of powdered 
sugar. When light add the whipped whites of 6 
oggs. Beat 6 minutes more Keep cold Serye in 
saucers of cream. 

Why do fifteen families require as many persons 
to do the marketing for them, trusting to the 
butchers and bakers and others for the weights 
and measures, and trusting to luck for the quality 
of things bought because the qualities are too small 
to be w nh a person's attention, when, if all were 
tog- ther, one buyer could buy better for them all at 
once; aided by acquired judgment and knowledge of 
goods and prices, and scales, weights, measures and 
bookfr? 



171. Apple Float. 

1 pound of fine, mealy cooking apples pared and 
quartered. 
Half cup of water. 
1 lemon. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

1 ounce of butter. 

2 whole eggs and 6 whl'es. 
Glove or cionamoa exiract. 

Stew the apples wirh the water, ragar, lemon juice 
and sh<iyed or grated rind and the butter, in a 
saucepan with a lid, till they are tender. Rub the 
pulp through a seive. Add the 2 eggs and c^ok the 
mixture 6 or 10 minutes till ihick. Then cool, 
flavor, beat light and add the 6 whites ot eggs whip 
ped firm and beat 5 minutes more. Keep cold. 
Serve in saucers of custard. 



And why do fifteen families living separately have 
fifteen small porticos going to waste when, if all 
were together, the small portions in the b^nds of a 
ahillful cok would m<ike a dish of which neirly a^l 
wou d partake and save a large item in the mar^e . 



172. Baked Ck>ooanut Oustard* 

2 quarts of milk. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

6 ounces of corn starch. 

Butter size of a guinea egg— 1 os. 

8 eggs. 

8 ounces of desiccated eocoanut. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it. Mix the 
starch in a bowl with a liitle cold milk, add it to the 
milk on the fire and take off immediately wiihrut 
waiting for it to boil again. Beat in the butter, 
then the eggs, about half the eocoanut, and pour the 
custard into two buttered pans where it will be only 
an inch de?p. Sprinkle the rest of the cocoa ntii 
over the tops, and a little sugar over that and bake 
10 or 16 minutes till set and of a y»llow color on 
top. Must be cold to serve. May have a spoonful 
of sweetened cream in the saucers. 



And when the ice supply is exhausted and the 
delicious ice creams and water ices which the fif een 
families have learned to prize above all the other 
sontrivances for dessert suddenly fail to appear, 
why must fifteen persons at least worry over th-) 
situation and spend the days in unquie'Kess cinjur. 
ing up cold dishes that shall almost fill the ices' 
place, when one person making a trade of such 
knowledge could satisfy them all without effort? 



173. Peaohes and Oream. 

The harder kinds of peaohes should be chopped 
to the size of strawberries and mixed with sugar 2 
or 3 hours before the meal. Allow about 4 ounces 
of sugar to a quart Soft peaches, after peeling, 
are best only quartered or rliced. If admissible 
serve them io large glass bowls ornamented wih 
quarters of red or yellow peaches placed in order 
and a pitcher of cream with ench bowl separately. 
If served individually in saucers pour the oream 
over only as they are dished up. 



Once we read in the Atlantic Monthly a series of ar- 
ticks in which all such questions as ihe precediug wei e 
asked with the intent of advising a system of co- 
operative housekeeping under which the fifteen 
household mariyrs, one for each ct ihd naid fifteen 
families, instead of all Euffering at once sh uld lake 
turn aLd turn about doing the work of each depart- 
ment f jr the entire co-operating community. It is 
a good many years ago, but we remember thinking 
then thai the only practicable form of CD-operative 
housekeeping is the American hotel system, modi* 
fied perhaps in the matters of fv ider senaration of 
rooms and of individuiil frtedom. 



TEE AUEBICAN PASTBY COOK. 



174. Strawberries and Oream. 

It generftUy mellows and improyes the fruit to let 
it remain covered with sugar in a ciM place a short 
time before serTing. Serre same as peaches and 
oream* 

Strawberries, raspberries and peaches in sugar 
seryed in saucers of ice oream must be mentioned 
also as the great public festiyal delicacies of (he 
season of fruits. For ioe creams, either pure oream, 
ordinary, or com starch creams see index. 

For the oo^^peratiye housekeeping idea has the 
defect of leiTing out the power of discharging in- 
competents. Under the hotel system when dfflouUies 
arise the heads of departments will make almost 
superhuman efforts and accomplish almost impossi 
bilities, partly because of the pecuniary Talue of 
their positions but more on account cf the reputation 
for efficiency to be made or marred. But no co. 
operatiye could be a good cook, for exaifkple, who 
should be in office only one week and out four, and 
did not care much for (he office anyway There are 
a thousand rocks on which such a community would 
split up, like the following. 

175. Strawberry Shortoake. 

Scarcely two families or two persons make this 
alike or belicTe any other person's way U the best. 

We are not going t > lay down any rule, but as 
long as people are asked which part of a turkey they 
they prefer, or how they will have their beefsteak 
oooked we expect to ask them how they have their 
strawberry shortcake made. 

The bakers and confectioners, who often sell large 
quantities generally m^ke layers of sweet cake such 
as the butter sponge cake, and place 8 of the sheets 
with sweetened strawberries between. 

But plenty of people say (hat is not right, but 
what can you expect the bakers to know about home 
doings, and they make a rich flaky sort of biscuit 
dough with a' good deal of shortening in and bake a 
large round cake big as a dinner plate, split it open 
and place a plenty of strawberries between the two 
halves. 

And there are others, whose tastes have become 
vitiated through (he enjoyment of the best hotel 
pies, who say the foregoing kind of short cake is 
too poor and they want t};eir short cake to be short, 
80 (hey have the best light and dry puff paste, or 
the (rimmiogs of it which have been rolled more, 
rolled out tbin on jelly cake pans, nicely baked, 
rather dry and crispy, and strawberries with their 
sugary syrup spread pleniiftilly between two, and 
powdered sugar on top. 

But even after these ways have been tried there 
remain the weighty qne-tions of wiie(her after straw- 
berries have been spread between there shouM also 
be more strawbenries on the top, and whether the 



short cake of biscuit dough should be buttered before 
being berried, ard whether the l>erries may have 
cream mixed with them or whether c cam is to be 
served with the shortoake. In short, to quote the 
words of the song, '*How do you like your shortcake 
done?" 

The best kind of flaky light dough will be found 
in the receipt for roly-poly puddings. It. is made 
with half the pie-paste quantity of butter and half 
baking powder, rolled in. 

177. Bavarian Oream. 



1} pints of inilk. 

1} pints of thick oream. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of gelatine— ftill weight. 

1 cupful or less cf maraschino. 

Set the milk over the fire with the sugar and gel* 
atine in it and stir till the gelatine i^ all dissolved — 
nearly at the boiling point. Then strain it into an 
ice cream freezer set in ice water and let it get 
nearly cold. Whip the cream to froth. Beat the 
milk in tbe freezer likewise and then mix the two 
and continue booting till the Bavarian is a delicate 
white sponge, and mix in the maraschino while 
beating. 

178' These creams are the most acceptable of all 
the substitutes for ioe cream, and have the advantage 
that they can be s-t in molds, and different sorts 
placed on a set table at tbe same time, or a mold 
entire served at a family tab's For hotel tervice it 
is generally bpst to serve them out of the freezer in 
saucers with whipped cream or fruit. They then 
appear on the bill of fare as : 

Maraschino Bavarian Cream. 

Bavarian Cream wi'h Compote of Pears,— or with 
grapes, white cherries, or with strawberries not 
oooked; the comnotes of course to be ioe cold, a 
spoonful served like a sauce with the white cream. 



170. Bavarian Oream Oheapf^^. 

8 pints of rich milk. 

1 cupfUl of cream. 
12 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of gelatine. 
6 whites of eggs. 
Flavoring. 

Set the milk over tbe fire with the sugar and gel" 
atine in it and stir till the gelatine is all dissolved. 
D ) not let it boil Strain into a f^reeser placed in 
ioe water and when nearly cold enough to set add 
the cup of oream, beat 10 minutes, whip the 6 
whites firm, stir (hat in and beat (he oream 6 min- 
utes more. Flavor while headngwith lemon,vanilla, 
almond, or other extract, instead of maraschino.

THE AUEBICAN PASTBY COOK. 



King LouiB did not keep his hage establishments 
for profit and made his Bavarian about like this — 
quite cosily : 1 quart of double cream, 2| ounces of 
gelatine, 6 ounces of powdered sugar, 1 cup of milk, 
} cup of noyan or other liqueur. DissoWe the gela- 
tine in the milk in a warm place. Put the sug%r in 
the cream, whip it to troth, drain the froth and whip 
again what drips through. Put back in the pan, 
pour the dissolved gelatine to the whipped, orenm a 
little at a time, add the flavor and put the cream in 
molds slightly oiled with sweet oil and set on ice. 
This, it may be observed, is barely one remove from 
the iced froths noti3ed among the icea. The froth is 
•ongealed by means of gelatine very cold instead of 
frost, and might be in glasses as well. 

180. Strawberry Bavarian Oream 

BATAKTOISB AUX F&AISBB. 



1 quart of double oream* 

12 ounces of sugar. 

1 quart of strawberries. 

2} ounces of gelatine. 

Dissolve the gelatine in a little of the cream 
with as much milk added to thin it. Aub the straw- 
berries through a seive, and add half the sugar to 
them. Whip the oream with the rest of the sugar 
in it to froth, mix in the dissolved gelatin^ then the 
strawberry syrup and set in molds. 

181. Anothbb Wat. 

Line Jelly molds with strawberries dipped in 
melted jellj to make them stick, and the molds set 
in ice water. When set firm fill the lined molds 
with either of the foregoing Bavarian creams. 



182 Roman Oream^ 

I quart of milk. 

10 ounces of sugar. 

1^ ounces of gelatine — good weight. 

Piece of stick cinnamon. 

1 cupful of thick cream. 

12 yolks of eggs. 

1 cupful of ouracao, or Madeira wine. 

Set the milk over the fire and put in a piece of 
thick cinnamon, the sugar and gelatine and stir till 
the gelatine is all dissolved Beat the yolks light 
and pour the milk just about at the boiling point to 
them. Set on the fire again for a minute but do not 
let it boil. Strain into a freezer set in ice water. 
When nearly cold enough to pet whip the cupful of 
cream and beat it in and add the curaoao. Tnis is a 
fine dusky yellow cream light and spongy, that fa^ls 
apart in the saucers of its own weight. 



183. The particular touch about all of these 
creams \n the getting along with the smallest possi- 
ble quanti'7 of gelatine. They are quite another 



thing and are not really good when made firm and ' 
tough with iu The object of the gelatine is to give 
consistency enough to the mi^k to allow it to become 
spongy when beaten like lAiipped oream. This also 
necessitates the creams being served very cold, a 
point on which their excellence also greatly depends 



184. Italian Oream. 



Only another name for R man cream. The fol 
lowing if the form with pure cream which, if it 
were the only waj would generally preclude its 
appearance at hote^ tables. The Italians themselves 
Ii*e to flavor it strongly with rum and add ground 
cinnamon till it looks brown* 

1 quart of oream to boil. 

1 pint of double oream to whip cold. 

1 pound of sugar. 
16 yolks of eggs. 

2 ounces of gelatine. 

Stick of cinnamon and piece of orange peeL 
Curacao or sherry or Madeira to flavor. 
Put the geUtine in a cap of milk in a warm plaoe 
ti dissolve some time before wanted. Boil the quart 
(^f ere >m with the sugar, cinnamon and orange peel 
in it. Beat the yolks and pour them to the boiling 
cream And immediately take off and strain into a 
freeser surrounded with ice water. When nearly 
cold pour in the dissolved gelatine and beat up 
light, then whip the pint of double cream to froih 
and stir it in and lastly the liqueur. 

We will point out here that all of our own way^, 
which we call hotel ways, being short and direct, 
dispense with the separate dissolving of the gelatine, 
which is really a tronbleaome and time consuming 
little matter, ^^e dissolve it in the milk or cream 
on the fire, without evei a previous steeping. Still 
if we happen to drop into the work-rooms of some 
restaurant FraneaUe we shall find them proceeding 
in a different manner, and such receipts as the last 
serve to show what that manner is. 



186. 



Italian Oream with Oomi>ote of 
Fiffs 



Gut a pound of figs into small pieces and one or 
two lemons likewise and stew them together with 
sugar and water. Make the compote ice cold and 
serve it a spoonful in each saucer with the Roman 
or Italian cream. A compote of fruit is fruit stewr^ 
in a thick rich syrup. 



180. Rooky Mountain Oream. 



Make Bavarian cream, about half the quantity of 
the first Bavarian receipt, also prepare about a pint 
of sweet green muscatel grapes, and enough of 
bright clear jellies cut in dice to make another pint. 
When the oream is finished beating and about to set

Arm mix in the grapes and jellies lightly without 
breakiDg thenr, and pour into a biight milk pan 
where it will be aboitt 1} inches deep. Shako and 
smooth it down and set on ioe. When to be serred 
out across in strips 2 inches wide. Cut these again 
in triangle shapes. Place the piece in the sauoer 
with the point upwards, pyramid form, and a spoon- 
ftil of whipped cream around. 

There should be 8 oolors of jelly, olear lemon » 
amber and red wine. 

187. Ohocolate Oream* 

1 quart of milk. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

1 ounce of gelatine. 

2 ounces of grated common chooolate. 
8 yolks of eggs and 8 whites. 

1 cup of cream. 

Vaoilla extract. 

Set the milk over the fire with the sugar chocolate 
and gelatine in it. Beat as it heats with the wire 
whisk till all is diasoWed, Beat the yolks in a bowl 
and at the first sign of boiling add them to the milk 
on the fire, let remain about a minute then strain 
into a freeser set in ioe water. 

Rinse out the thick chocolate custard that adheres 
to the kettle with the cup of cream and add that to the 
other in the Areeser. FlaTor with Tanilla, beat up 
as it cools and at last add the 8 whites whipped firm 
and beat up 6 minutes more. Put the cream in oiled 
molds or serre it by spoonfuls out of the flreezer with 
a spoonftil of sweetened cream whipped to froth as 
a sanoe 



188. PlBtaohio Oream. 



Make Bayarian oream half the quanity of the 
first Bararian receipt Throw a pound of pistachio 
kernels in a yessel of boiling water and in two min- 
utes take them out, peel, and pound them a few at 
a time in a mortar with a spoonful of witer. Rub 
the paste through a seiTe, mix it with the Bavarian 
while beating and color with spinach green — the 
pressed out juice of spinach leayes mixed with 
sugar. 

Where this oream is desired only for its green 
color as when it is to fill a mold in imitation of a 
bunch of asparagus with green tops, almonds can be 
used instead of pistachios ; they are very much 
cheaper; and spinach juice coloring used the same. 

189. Rose Oream. 

Make Bavarian, flayor slightly with rose extract 
ani color it light pink. 

IGO. Charlotte Busse. 

Line a plain cake mold, or a small round tin pan, 
or a long and narrow mold made for the purpose 
with either lady fingers or large sponge dropjB. This is 



done by dipping the rdgea of the cakes in white of 
eggs and placing them bide by side overlapping each 
other. Then make Bavarian cream sufficient, and 
when finished beating, just as it begins to set, fill up 
the molds with it. ^ 

If poured in too thin the cream runs and covers 
up the cakes, yet it should be fiuid enough' to settle 
to the shape and bind them all together. 

Set the charlotte in the refligerator to become firm 
and cold. 

lOL Bavarian oream is designated as being the 
filling oftenest employed, but there is no rule in the 
matter and any other of the creams can be used as 
well. Charlotte a la Chantilly is charlotte-russe 
filled with the thickest of thick cream sweetened and 
flavored and whipped to froth and made firm enough 
to turn out simply by being made very cold. Char^ 
UftU rune au maratquin is the charlotte filled with 
maraschino Bavarian cream very highly flavored 
with the liqueur and with correspondingly less 
sugar. Charlotte ru§u aux firaUee is the charlotte 
filled with strawberry Bavarian oream, or with whole 
strawberries in whipped oream like the mode ohan- 
tUly. 

192. Individual Oharlottes 

It is easily praciicable to make them in oustard 
cups with 3 thin lady fingers trimmed a little to 
shape and not overlapped. Fill with any of the 
creams and place them in the refrigerator to set solid. 
When served have ready some thick whipped cream, 
turn out the charlottes on ice oream plates and top 
them with a spoonful of the ftoth. 

103. Serving Larire Oharlottes 

Says an old author — Fielding: '* Many exquisite 
viands might be rejected by the epicure if it was a 
sufficient cause for his contemning of them as com 
mon and vulgar, thiU something was to be found in 
the most paltry alleys under the same name. * * 
Where then lies the difference be' ween the food of 
the nobleman and *the porter, if both are at dinner 
on the same ox or calf, but m the eeaaomng, the dreee 
mg, the ffamiehinff, andtheeetUng forthf" 

Charlotte-russe is one of the few royal dishes that 
have become universally known — by name. But as 
commonly met with it is a fine thing < run to seed;*' 
one of the shabby genteel ; a very distant relation 
of the origin%l. Tl.'O first departure uses a uponge 
cake with the inside all cut out and the crust filled 
up with a cream or blanc-mange not so bad ; but it 
fklls from that to a lining of slices of any sort of 
stale cake, of burnt, scraped and trimmed cake, husks 
and scraps, filled with something sour and nasty. 

The individual style of servioe makes the long and 
. r arrow shane of mold desirable for slices to be out 



48 



THB AMERIOAN PASTBT COOK. 



soross, but the lining should alwAjs be of lady 
fingers, their thinneei and glaied sugar surfiu>e ma- 
king them the most suitable. 

But a large round charlotte may be elioed as well 
like a oake or cheese and the good workman will 
like to show in suoh broad slices the sponge-like 
texture of the cream filling. A spoonftU of thick 
sweetened cream ice cold should be placed in the 
plate or saucer firpt. 

104. A charlotte set on the table whole should 
be ornamented with small piping patterns of oake 
icing on the sides and a coat of thin icing on top 
colored very light brown with a red hot salamander 
held oTer it A chantilly charlotte should have no 
oake lining on the bottom of the mold, snd when 
turned out should haye whipped cream piled high 
on top and spotted with red or with pieces of colored 
jelly. A strawberry ohsrlotie in like manner should 
hare strawberries and whipped cream heaped upon 
it. A border of whipped cream placed around the 
base, or meringues iuTcrted like cups filled with 
berries or grapes and set around are other suitable 
and proper ornaments, and so are the shapes of gel- 
atine paste colored green with spinach juice as rec- 
ommended for molds of ice creanu 



105. Parisian Charlotte. 



^ Receipts and direct! ns fur making difierent colors 
of glaze or boiled icing were given in connection 
with white caxes near the beginning of this book. 
Cut some thin sponge drops or sheets of sponge cake 
in squares and dip one side of them by means of a 
fork in the g aze and let them dry and harden. Haye 
scTeral colors. Line plain drum shaped molds wiih 
these colored squares checkei^board fashion, dip. 
ping the edges in melted g'aze or candy to make 
them stick. Then fill up the molds with any of the 
creams. When cold and set turn out and set on the 
tab!e whole as directed for chariot te-russe. 



107. Charlotte for a Small Party. 

And now for the conTfn>erce of those wishing 
just one charlotterus-e and not enough for a hotel 
dinner we append a first-class working receipt that 
will suit. 

2} pints of thin cream. 

1 teacupful of maraschino. 

7 ounce* of sugar. 

1 package of Cox's gelatine— 1 J ounces. 

Put the extra ha^f pint of cream in a small sauce, 
pan and the gelstine and sugar with it, set over the 
fire and beat with the wire egg whisk till the gela- 
tine is all dissoWed— the quicker the better. Pour 
the maraschino into the cold cream, then strain in 
the contents of the saucepan, set the whole in a pan 
of ice water with salt in it and whip the cream mix- 
ture till it begins to set, when pour it into the pre- 
pared mold. 

The mold should be made ready beforehand. A 2 
quart Jelly mold wi'l do, or a cake mold. Line it 
with lady-fingers placed edge to edge, the edges 
wetted with white of egg. Omnment the top on 
taming out with whipped cream or meringue. 



106 Wanted— A Name. In eyerything and aU 
thid country really running to pie? A Chicago lady 
tourist kindly wishing to do the writer a serrice de. 
scribed for him her way of making a "Charlotte- 
ru<*8e'* that is highly fsteeroed among her circle of 
friends It accordingly here appears in place. Bake 
2 tbia shee's of sponge cake on jelly cake pans and 
while they nre i^till warm p'ace them on soup plates 
and press them lightly ti the shape. Pill one with 
whipped cream with gelatine in it (Ba?a'ian cream 
in effect) and place the other sheet of cake over it 
like a lid. This is convenient to cut. It can be 
covered with powdered sugar or with icing. It is 
good, excellent, but through some miserable preju- 
dice or other we don't like to call it charlotte-msse. 
It is too much like pie. 



108. Table JelUes. 

There are jellies made with pure fruit juice fik 
t«red through paper and set with gelatine— Preocb 
extras— we may touch upon them Airther on. These 
first considered are the everyday, off hand sort found 
on hotels tables and in the windows of the confto- 
tioners who sell them by the mold or glassful, or 
fUrnish party suppers. 

100. Stook Jelly. 

Once making of stock jelly serves for 2 or 8 mealfl. 
For 6 quarts take; 

6} quarts of water. 

8 pounds of sugar. 

8 ounces rf gelatine. 

10 lemons— juice of all, thin shaved rinds of 5. 

1 or 2 ounces of whole spices — cloves, maoe, 
cinnamon. 

10 whites of eggs. 

Put the water in a bright brass kettle, add all the 
other ingredienta — ^the lemon juice squeezed in 
without the seeds, the yellow rind pared very thin, 
and the white of eggs beaten a little with some water 
mixed in first. The clean egg shells may be put 
in also to assist in the clarification. Ukc the sheet 
gelatine that fioats, f^r preference. Then set the 
kettle on the side of the range and let it slowly come 
to a boil with occasional stirring. 

Let it boil about half an hour and above all, to 
avoid the trouble and waste of having to boil it 
again, be sure that the white foam of egg on top 
becomes thoroughly cooked so that it will go down 



THB AKEBICAN PASTBT COOK.

and mix with the Jelly again like bo much meal. 
Sometimes to aooomplieh this it is necessary to set 
the kettle (in the oven a few minutes to get heat 
enough on the top. 

Then run it' through the flannel jeUy bag bus- 
pended from a hook. The boiling haying been prop, 
erly attended to there should be not the slighest 
difficulty io getting it to run through not only dear 
but bright and transparent as glass. The first pour- 
ing coats the inside of the filtering bag with the 
congealed white of egg and every succeeding running 
through brightens the jelly. ^ 



The aboTC makes jelly of good quality. It can be 
made cheaper with less sugar and lemons. It may 
be set down as a rule that jelly o%nnot be made this 
way without more or less lemon juiee or some acid 
equiyalent — ^it will not run thiough a filtering bag 
without. 



2CX>. Jellies in Variety. 



The stock haying been made it can now be diyi. 
ded into as many kinds as may be desired, thanks to 
the flayoriog extract makers. 

But the stock jelly is already good and mildly 
flayored and care should be taken not to oyer season 
it, or injure its bright appearance. 

Jelly is quite as much for ornament as use. It 
can easily be made to attract notice at the finest table 
for its lustre and rich colors eyen if neyer tasted, 
therefore its appearance is the main oonsiddration. 
Lemon extract cannot be put in jelly because it 
makes a milky appearance and dims its brilliancy. 
Orange extract the same Most of the other extracts 
can be used to flayor. Use wine in small proportion 
to mix with some of the stock and color deep red, 
but run through the jelly bag again while it is yet 
warm. F^yor some with yanilla and color it either 
amber or brown with burnt sugar, and ran it 
through the jelly bag again. Flayor some with straw- 
berry and color it pink, and leare some plain, pale 
yellow. 



201. Soda Water Jellies. 

Haying a number of difierent colors and flayers 
prepared as above, fill a sufficient number of tall 
thin stem glasses with them, but not quite to the 
top, and set them in a cold place to harden. Make 
the foam for the tops by beating a pint of jelly with 
a wire egg whisk in a pan set in ice water and when 
it is partly frothed whip up the whites of 8 eggs, 
add them to the jelly and continue beating them 
together a minute or two. Then pile the white froth 
thus made on top of the glasses. Keep them in a 
cold place to solidify, and serye them yery cold. 
These make a fine appearance in pyramidal form on 
a set table. 



202. One Quart of Jelly. 



The rule is, for good quality : 
1 quart of water. 
1} ounce? of gelatine. 
. 8 ounces of sugar. 
1 or 2 lemons 

1 teaspoonful of whole mixed spices. 

2 whites of eggs and the dean shells. 

But a cupful of water more must be added to 
allow for eyaporation and loss unless it is intended 
to add i pint of wine to the stock jelly produced. 



For jellies to senre ordinarily at dinner pour them 
in' bright pans, an inch or more in depth and when 
set cut out little diamond shaped blocks and serre 
two such pieses of difierent color in the same saucer. 

203. Obampagne Jelly. 

DissoWe one package of Cox's or other fine shred 
gelatine in ^ pint of hot water with 6 ounces of 
sugar in it. Beat about oyer the fire to dissolve it 
quickly. Then strain the dissoWed gelatine into a 
quart of champagne in a large bowl. Set on ice and 
when it is about to set take out half a cupful and 
beat it with a wire egg whisk 1 minute. Return the 
frothed jelly to the bowl, stir round once and let it 
remain on ice to solidify, either in tlie bowl to be 
cut out in blocks, or in glasses. There will be bub. 
bles all through the jelly and a thin froth on top. 



204. SparUinff Wine Jelly. 

Take the brightest wine jelly, deep red, as made 
by the s'ock jelly method, ana froth a little of 
it and maoage as directed fur champagne jelly, stir- 
ring the froth in with only one turn — ^not beatiog, 
which would destroy its clearness — whipped jelly 
can be congealed in the bottom of a mold first, nearly 
cold jelly poured in and the whole turned out at last 
with the troth on top. 

205. Punch Jelly. 



Make a quart of stock jelly by the 1 quart re- 
ceipt, and when finished add to it a small cup of 
strong tea and a small cup of mixed wine and 
brandy. Gut a lemon in small thin slices and let 
them fioat in it* Dish up with pieces of lemon in 
each portion. 

206. Pure Fruit Juioe Jellies. 

For orange jelly : Put the thin shayed rind of 2 
oranges io a bowl, tqueese in the juice of 4. Boil 
a quart of water with a pound of sugar and pour 
the hot syrup to the orange peel and juice. Dissolye 
2 ounces of gelatine in a cup of hot water separately. 
.When the syrup has stood long enough to draw the

flavor of the orange peel flitter it ^instead of using 
wbite of eggs to clarify — through a flanuel bag lined 
with a sheet of blotiiog paper. Afterwards mix in 
the dissolved gelatine. 

All sorts of fresh fruit juices oao be jellifled in 
the aboTC manner For a guide to the proportions 
of fhiit snd sugar required in so much water see 
the receipts for fruit ices. The rule for gelatine is 
1} ounces to a quart of water or Juice. 

207. Oalf' 8 Foot Jelly. 

GalTes' feet make good jelly as does gelatine, it 
is only more brittle and liable to fkll apart of its 
own weight. 4 feet will produce about a gallon of 
jelly. Set them on to bcil in 8 gallons of wnter and 
keep them simmering at the back of the range till 
they are dissolved and the liquor is reduced to less 
than half, which may be in 8 or 10 hours. For 
further directions see the Book of Salads. When 
the cslf 's foot jelly has been diyested of grease it is 
the same thing as gelatine and water and is ready to 
have sugar and other ingredients added to make 
stock jelly in the usual way. 



208. Ornamental Jellies. 



1. Fruits in jelly: With the very clearest and bright* 
est jelly various pretty devices can be carried out. 
Place a flne bunch of grapes in a mold and fill up with 
jelly. Or partially line a mold with fruits dipped in 
jelly and let them get cold in place before filling up 
with jelly. Orange and lemon slices float, but they 
can be dipped in warm jelly and pushed down to 
line molds of jelly that is nearly set. Peach and 
apricot quarters may be done the same way. 

2. Fish and other illusions in jelly : Many jelly 
molds and articles of crockery ware have fishes and 
fruits stamped in for ornament. Pour a teaspoonftil 
of blano-maoge or jaune m%nge into the pattern, set 
it in ice water, turning it about so as to thinly coat 
it, then fill up the hollow with jelly and let it all 
set firm. Line a large jelly mold with a coating of 
clear jelly turned about in it in a pan of ice WMter, 
Place your Utile white or yellow fishes on the lining 
and when they baye become solidly set fill up the 
mold with clear jelly nearly cold. The fishes appear 
solid enough from the outside but when cut all that 
can be found of them is a small mark no thicker 
than a knife blade. 

8. Macedoine jelly : Cut different colored jellies 
in small dice and mix them together.- Moisten with 
a little clear jell;- melted but nearly cold and fill 
molds with it. 

4. Fill molds with 8 colors by letting one larger 
set solid and then pouring another kind upon it. 



200. Geneva Lake Oakea 

Derice for showing fioe icing work that is lost on 
large pieces Make 2 ielly cakes^of 8 or 4 layen 
evch and of diameter as broad as the largest cake 
stands will hold, and cut out the inside of all but the 
bottom layer of the cakes, making a basin sur. 
rounded by a wall Spread the inside with some 
kind of jam to hide the cake and then fill them to 
the brim with the clearest jelly, amber color for one 
and light red tor the other. Ice over the top sur- 
rounding rim^of cake. 

The jelly when poured, in must be just at the 
point of beginning to set. If too firm its transpar- 
ency will be destroyed, and if too thin it may soak 
into the cakes. 

On the glassy surfkoe of these lakes may be placed 
white swans of the finest icing, water lilies, boats, 
gondolas, arbors set on islands, trees, temples, foun- 
tains, all of the smallest practicable sise. Every 
thread of the finest icing shows plainly on the sur- 
face of these jelly charlottes, and besides they are 
▼ery good to eat. 



210. White Mountain Qema» 

Make thin sponge drops about the sizs of the 
top of a teacup and place spots of meringue paste or 
icing all around their edge to form a rim or border. 
The spots should be the size of small cranberries and 
a high, point should be drawn up as the tube leayes 
them. Bake a few minutes with the oven door 
open to dry the icing straw color. Fill the centers 
with a spoonfiil of wine or lemon jelly so nearly 
cold as not to run much. 

21L Sprioff Lake Qema. 



Make macaroon paste by the receipt for common 
macaroons, drop portions on baking pans and flat- 
ten them somewhat by means of two spoons. Bake 
the macaroons, and when slacked baked put them 
into patty pans or gem pans of corresponding size 
and press them into the shape to form a sort of little 
baskets when cold. Ornament the edges of these 
with small spots icing as in the preceding article, 
bake a minute or two, and' when cold flU the gems 
with minced wine jelly of diffierent colers mixed. 



212. Icinff and Ornamenting Oakes. 

As these matters have been mentioned iacidentally 
in other parts of the book we will recapitulate by 
obsenriog that there are three well-known ways of 
ornamenting calfes; first, by patterns in piping of 
white icing on the cake itself not iced, as on the 
fine yellow, glazed surface of a ssToy c^ike, or a 
dark chocolate cake, or a chariot te-russe ; second, 



THE AMEBICAN PA8TBT COOK.

by ooTeriDg t1i« eakes with different colored glaze or 
boiled ioing u described in oonnecioQ with white 
eakee, and, third, by firosiing with the raw ioing as 
made for meringae puffip and "kisaea/* and orna- 
menting with the same. 

The first requisite is to make the cake itself sym 
metrical and leyel by trinimiDg. The cakes of a 
skillful cake maker will rise in baking all round 
alike so that only a mere shaving will have to be 
taken off, bat whether little or much muet be cut it 
is obyiously useless to try to make an object that is 
not ^square with the world" look well by merely 
ooTcring its deformity with a coat of icing. 

Fnilt cakes always require two coats of icing, and 
all cakes that are to be handsomely ornamented 
should have the same double covering. 

Make the ioing as directed under the head of 
meringue puff^ and macaroons, with a pound of 
powdered sugar to 6 whites of eggs. Spread it all 
over the cake? with a palette knife, smooth over 
rough places, fill up hollows, cover the hole left by 
the cake mold in the center with a patch of writing 
paper and ice over that, and leave the cakes an 
hour or two to dry. 

For the second coat use powdered sugar sifted 
through a fioe eeive or Swiss muslin ; beat up a 
pound with 4 whites and then add 4 more whites one 
at a time, beatiog afty each addition till the icing 
is firm again, except the last white which makes the 
glossy surthce on the cake and should only be beaten 
in a little. Drop in the few drops of acetic acid 
sometime near the end of the beating and carefully 
add a drop or two of liquid bluing or dissolved 
indigo, to whiten the icing, and some flavoring 
extract. 

213. To get a fine surfkoe on the cakes as smooth 
and free ftrom marks as fine card board the icing 
must be first as firm by beating as it can be mide 
and thinned with the last vvbite of egg, and another 
if necessary till it will settle slowly to smoithoess 
on the c»kes, but will not actually drip off. Be. 
sides that the cakes must be made smoother by dex- 
terously drawing over them the edge of a band of 
paper. 

Cut a sheet of foolscap into ribbons 2 inches wide. 
Spread the prepared icing thickly on the the top of 
the cake, take the paper strip by the two ends and 
scrape off the surplus icing with the paper edge at 
one even stroke, drawing towards you. Persons in 
practice can so well manage a ribbon of paper held 
stretched between the fingers and thumbs of both 
hands that way that they can smooth over a cushion 
or any concave or convex shape covered with icing 
without leaving the mark of either beginning or 
ending. 

When the sides of the cakes have likewise been 
covered and smoothed set the cakes in a drying 
place. 



214. The ornamental piping on cakes is done 
by pressing stiff icing or meringue paste out of the 
cut point of a paper comet. Roll up half a sheet of 
note paper into flinnel shape and pin it, nearly fill 
with the icing, and double over the paper so as to 
shut it in. If you cut off the point of the cornet 
straight the piping pressed out will be a plain round 
cord. If a slanting side isnip is taking off the icing 
comes out like narrow tape. Cut the poi it of the 
paper like saw teeth and a three or four sided cord 
is formed, and th^re are many variations. We name 
the paper comet for example,but for constant use there 
are made tubes or points of the thinnest brass plate 
filed into the required shapes at the points, and 
these are dropped into paper cornets made large 
enough to receive them. 

The biass point that is filed into three saw teeth 
will form a border of leaves around a cake. The 
tooth that is uppermost is caused by a motion of the 
hand to make the indentaiion marks as the icing 
passes under and out, and a sudden breaking off 
draws out the leaf to a point. This will probably 
sufficiently explain the matter of cake ornamenta- 
tion for those who have never seen it done, the rest 
must come through actual practice and example. 



216. To Make Flowers for Oake Orna- 
ments. 



Flower making of ioing and gum paste is a trade 
of itself and it is generally cheaper to buy than to 
make them. But it oiten happens that the ready 
made article is not obtainable and we must do the 
best we can. 

Dip three or four sheets of writing paper in some 
wax melted on a plate and form the flowers with the 
comets or brass tubes on the waxed paper. The 
comet that has the point cut off slantwise when 
pressed will discharge the icing in a narrow ribbon 
form and it is not difficult with that to form five 
rounded leaves, the points all meeting in the center 
and making a pansy, or a number of narrower petals 
around a centre like a dahlia. To make the con- 
ventional red and white roses a core, or little 
pyramid an inch high has first to be made and 
let dry to form them on. These coves are of 
stiff icing forced out of a comet and drawn up 
high. They should stand on small pieces of waxed 
paper. V\hen dry and bard wrap a morsel of 
the ribbon icing pressed out of the comet over 
the point of the core, like the inside leaf of a rose- 
bud. After suddenly breaking off the ribbon com- 
mence again at the back of the first leaf and form 
another, covering the point of the core on the other 
side. Let the next leaf lean outwards a little and 
the next still more, making them all adhere to the 
core by one edge of the ribbon and miking the rose 
leaves larger and larger till the core is covered and 
there is room for no more. The flat four and five

leared flowers, euoh as resemble appie blossoms and 
pansies, sbould be painted with a few fine lines of 
oolor. The roses are made red by coloriLg the icing 
they are m * de of. 

After learning to use the cornets in making 
borders on cakes and making flowers, to mase 
raised ornamental work, such as lattice work, 
fences, sides of templed, etc , to be raised up and 
joined together on the cakes, or baskets and other 
objects it is onlj necessary to know that all such 
may be made on parer coated with white wix, and 
when the object is dry and hard the paper can be 
warmed and it will slip off, 

Most of the white plaster-like ornaments for cakes 
in the confectioners' windows, such as birds, baskets, 
lace leayes, yases and twelfth-cake figures are made 
of gum paste, a compound that could be eaten but 
probably never is, although it is ooe-half sugar. 



216. Gum Paste. 



1 ounce, or a little more of gum tragaoanth (gum 
dragon). 

8 ounces of finest powdered sugar- 

8 ounces of corn starch. 

The gum must be soaked 12 hours or more before 
it is used. Put it in a cup with half a cup of water, 
cover to keep out dust and set it on a warm shelf 
When dissolved squeeze it through a clean towel by 
twisting with considerable fbrce. Scrape up the 
gum, place it on a dish, add the sugar a little at a 
time and work them together with a paddle or 
wooden spoon. Add a drop of liquid blue to whiten 
it. When the sugar is all in begin adding the starch 
the same way. Pull out the paste as it becomes stifif. 
and d )uble and pull again, and when all the starch 
has been worked in the paste is ready for use. It 
may be pressed into shallow molds of fancy figures 
made in plaster of piris, or in carved boards and 
left in them till dry and hard. 



217- Almond Gum Paste. 



An eatable sort, and seoji- transparent: 

1 ounce of gum tragacanth^allow more for waste. 

1 pound of fine powdered sugar. 

4 ouiices of the paste of pounded almonds. 

8 ounces of corn starch. 

Blanch the almonds, pound them to a fine paste 
and pass it through a seive. Make the gum paste 
as directed in the preceding article and add the 
almond paste to it after the sugar and before the 
starch. This is suitable to make small cornucopia 
or horns of plenty, and other objects to be orna- 
mented with fine icing for a finish. 



218. Oandy Ornaments. 
A marble slab or marble top table is needed to 



form pane's, windows, and the like, of dear candy, 
on. Slightly oil the slab. Take a comet fil'ed with 
icing and form the outline frame of aehuroh window, 
for example, and into the rim so made pour dear 
colored candy. S'x or eight keystone shaped pftoels 
made the same way may be set up and joined together 
by the edges to form a basket, which in turn may 
be filled with macaroons. 

The rim to held the oandy in shape on the slab 
may be mide of dough oiled over, or of putty when 
large sheets of oandy are needed to build up large 
ornamental pieces. 



219. Piaster of Paris Molds. 



Are made by mixing dentist's plaster with water 
to the thinners almost of cream, pouring it into a 
shallow box and pressing the object qf which an 
impression is desired down into it. In a few min- 
utes the plaster hardens and presently the fhiit, or 
Stamped or curved obj^'ctcan be withdrawn. Articles 
so used should be oilei befire immersing. The 
molds should be baked at a gentle heat afterwards. 
A whole tomato or apple mold may be made by en- 
tirely covering the fruit in the liquid plaster and 
when it has hardened sawing in two and removing 
the fruit. A hole is cut into which the oandy may 
be poured when the two halves are tied together. 
Gum pase is pressed either with rolling-pin or pes- 
tle into shallow mold^ of shells, leaves and doll 
figures, which are left to dry and are afterwards 
painted or ornamented with icing. 



220. Glim Arabic lomff. 

To give to ctke icing the tenacity thi^ allows 
borders of fringe and loop work to be made on 
cakes, with strings of fine piping hanging between 
points several inches apart without breaking, mix 
with every pound of fine powdered sugar from 1 io 
2 ounces of gum arable. Powder the gum and dis- 
solve it first in a spoonful of hot water in a cup set 
on the side of the range, and add a little at a time 
to the icing while beating it up. The paste of gum 
tragaoanth (gum dragon) as prepared for making 
gum paste can also be used in the same manner. 

The ordinary methods and means employed for 
cake and senter piece ornamention having now been 
ezrlained the writer will here state that he has a 
different method of his own, which produces orna- 
mental effects incomparably superior to the common 
clumsy pyramid of cakes or the unmeaning and 
futile temple of gum pa«te, and which have gained 
the admiration of some of the people whose appro- 
bat ion in such matters decides the question of merit. 
The new method may be fully explained with the 
aid of illustrations, in a few additional pages at some 
future time.

921. A Few Candles for Amatenr Candy 
Pullers. 



The French confectioners recognize as many 
as twelve stages or degrees in boiling sugar, 
ranging from the ** petit lisse" to the «« caramel 
noir " — ^from simple sjrrup to burnt sugar canimel. 
However, we have not time to learn the degrees 
^only just a little time to make some candy. 

222. Oandy for Ohristmas Toys, Bto. 

2 pounds of granulated rugtr. 

1 pint, or rather leas, of water. 

1 large teaspoonf'il of powdered gum arable. 

1 level teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Flavoring. 

Dissolve the powdered gum in the water made 
wa'm for the purpose. Then add to the gum-water 
the sugar and cream of tartar and set on to boil Do 
not stir the sjiup after it is once well mixed Ir 
should boil about 16 minutes. Then trj u by drop- 
ping a little in cold water. When the lump retaini* 
its shape pretty well and can be worked between the 
fingers like gum paste it is ready. Poor it into the 
shallow planter of paris molds, either oiled or we* ted 
to make doll figures, or figures of animals, fishes, 
etc , etc. 

This, if cast without being stirn^, makes clear 
candy, but to have it white and opaque stir the 
Cindy in the kettle giving it only from 10 to 20 
turns with a spoon, before pouring it out. The flav- 
oriog oil may be added while stirri g Should the 
candy set in the kettle add water and make it hot 
again, with care that the candy does not immediately 
begin to burn to caramel. 



223. Rose Oream Oandy. 

The same ingredients and proportions as the pre- 
ceding receipt. Boil to the same degree. Then take 
the kettle from the fire, let it stand 5 mibuies to 
lose some of its heat, and red coloring; enough to 
make it pink, aod a few drops of rose extract. Have 
a buttered dish ready, stir the candy rapidly with a 
spoon till it begins to change its bright appearance 
to a dull color, that is a sign of setting, then pour it 
immediately into the dish. 

224. Lemon Oream Oandy. 

The same as rose cream candy. Flavor with oil 
of lemon and use no coloring. This is as white as 
cake icing. 

225. Ohooolate Oream Drops. 

These are lumps of cream candy coated by being 
dipped in melted chocolate. 
Make white cream candy by the method described 



for rofe cream candy, hut flavor it with va ilia if at 
alL Pour it hot int > plaster of pari^ molds if you 
have them, making hazelnut sizes of drops. If no 
molds form the cand> when nearly cold with the 
fingers, then taking them on a fork dip each piece in 
a bowl of chocolate, either common or sweet vanilla, 
melted by being set on the side of the range, and set 
the drops on buttered pans to cool and dry. Other 
shapes besides drops cin of course be made in the 
same manner. The boiled icings or glaze elsewhere 
described when left over from icing cakes can also 
be formed into cream drops and coated by dipping 
in melted chocolate, and so likewise can be used the 
common cake icing and macaroon mixtnres'that may 
be left over from their first purpose. 

226. Oocoanut C andy. 



Turti to receipt number 222, take the same ingre- 
dients and boil the candy to a degree a little nearer 
the brittle stage ; take it from the fire and put in 1 
pound of fresh grated cocoanut Stir rapidly to 
thoroughly mix, then pour the candy thinly in a 
buttered dish. When using desiccated coooanut 
which has no moisture to reduce the candy to thin- 
ness boil the candy only to the point named in the 
first receipt and the same as for cream candies. 



^ 227. Almond Candy. 

1 pound or a little less of almonds blanched and 
split. 

2 pounds of granulated.Bugar. 
1 pint scant of water. 

1 large teaspoonful of powdered gum arabic 

1 level teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Rose extract to slightly flavor. 

Dissolve the gum in the water made warm, add 
the sugar and cream tartar and boil without stirring 
16 or 20 minutes. When a drop in culd water sets 
nearly hard so that it can only just be pressed flat 
between the finger and thumb take the kettle o£f the 
fire. Drop the flavoring by spots over the surface, 
give the candy only one or two turns with a spoon to 
mix it in, then pour it into slightly buttered pans, in 
thin sheets. Push the split almonds into the warm 
candy with the fingers. Mark it before it gets cold 
for breaking by rolling over it the edge of a thin 
dinner plate. Sliced cocoanut can be used instead 
of almonds. 



228. Stiok Candy. 



Make and boil the same as in the preceding re. 
oeipt without the almonds. Pour the candy, or a 
portion of it, without stirring on to a marble slab. 
Drop fltvoriog over it when partly oooled, cut in 
strips and roll into round sticks.

229. White Suff ar Oandy to Pall. 

1 pound of white sugar. 

A small half pint of water. 

A half teaspoonful of cream tartar. 

1 ounce of butter 

Oil of peppermint or lemon or other flayoring. 

B-)il all together, ejoept the fla?oring, about 15 
mioutee. Try by dropping a little in cold water. It 
must t-et hard to be done. D i not s ir it at all, but 
pour on a buttered dinh and flavor when oool enough 
to handle. Pull it till it is) quite white. 

230. Peanut Candy. 

1 pound of sugar. 

8 ounces of peanuts. 

Make the peanuts hot in the oven. Set the sugar 
over the fire in a kettle to melt without any water. 
Stir it a little. When it is all melted and of the 
eolor of golden synip or light molasees mix in the 
peanuts* pour the eandy into a buttered shallow pan 
and when nearly cold out it into strips and blocks. 

281. Hiokory nut and almond is%nAy i^ mide in 
the above manner, and will be better with a found 
of the nuts iastead of half a pound. In the same 
manner with a pound of grated eocoanot a brown 
variety may be made to match the white and red 
oocoanut caramels (called also oocoanut cakes and 
coooanut gems) described at number 161. Nougat 
is the French name of nut candies made by melting 
the sugar without water as in the foregoing receipts. 

282. Nouffat Baskets—Corbeilles de 

Noiz. 

The hickory nut, almond, pecan, or oocoanut 
candies made as directed for peanut oandy may be 
pressed while cooling into basket shapes of tin or 
crockery ware, and sticks and twists of the same 
placed for handles and borders. Very small baskets 
formed in fancy gem pans are used to fill with straw- 
berries or other articles for ornamental purposes on 
set supper tables. For this purpose the proportion 
of nuts may be increased to 1} or even 2 pounds to 
1 pound of sugar. 

288. Almond Tafl^. 

CSalled in England Everton taffy, after a town of 
that name. 

1} pounds of brown sugar. 

8 ounces of best fresh butter. 

1 teaoupful of vinegar and water-— about h«lf and 
half 

8 to 12 ounces of almonds. 

Scald and peel the almonds, split them and spread 
them evenly on two large dishes slightly buttered. 
Boil the oihir ingreJi^nts together about 15 or 20 
minuter. Shake them together at first but do not 



stir, ^hen a drop of the candy sets quite bird and 
brittle in cold water take it from the fire and pour 
it evenly all over the almonds, only just deep 
enough to cover them. This kind cannot be stirred 
nor pulled, as the butter separates from the sugar 
which then turns grainy. 

284. Oaramel8» Plain or Maple. 

Make the candy of the preceding receipt, omitting 
the almonds htn it has cooled on the dishes 
mark it in «quar«s with the edge of a dinner plate 
rolled over i', aud when cold cut the markings 
through, making little square blocks. 

For maple caramels use maple sugar in the same 
way. 

235. Ohooolate Oaramela. 

1 pound of sugar— either brown or white will do 

1 ounce of butter. 
Half cup of milk. 

2 ounces of grated chocolate. 
Vanilla flavoring. 

Set the milk, butter and sugar on to boil, and stir 
in the grated chocolate and flavoring. After that 
do not stir the mixture again or it will go to sugar 
in the dish. Boil sbout 10 minutes. When a drop 
in cold water i>ets rather hard but not brittle pour 
the candy into a dish well buttered. Mark in little 
squnre blocks when set. Warm the dish or tin tray 
a Hi tie if the candy sticks. 



286. Molasses Oandy to Pull. 

1 large c 'ffiDe cupful of molasses. 

12 ounces of sugar, eitlier brown or white. 

One -third of a cupful of vinegar. 

Half cupful of wmer. 

1 ounce of butter. 

Put ail in a Icetrle himI t»«i> 1 '• •!«■ 20 minutes. Try 
in cold water. It mubt hiui ii I ihe drops set brittle 
and fiirly snap between the fingers. Then pour 
it on buttered plates. Pur. 



287. Molasses candy if not pulled but merely 
allowed to set on dishes is improved by hariog 
about a half teasponful of soda stirred in after it 
hss been taken from the fire and before i' is poured 
out. Flavorings may be added at the same time. 



238. Ohooolate Oandy to Pull. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of light colored molasses or syrup. 

Half oupfUi of cream. 

1 ounce of grated chocolate. 

VaoiiU to flavor. 

Boil the cream, molasses and sugar together about 
15 minutes, then throw in the chocolate and boil till 
the candy sets brittle in cold water. Pour on dishes^ 
flavor when cold enough to hand.e, and pull.

288(l« MintDropa 

1 pound pulverised sugar. 

1 heaping teaspoonful powdered gmn arabio. 

5 tablespoonfuls water. 

1 tablespoonful essence peppermint. 
Put the water on in a small saucepan or cup and 
the gum in it and let warm up. When the gum is 
dissoWed put about a quarter of the sugar in, let 
boil up and then add half the sugar that remains 
putting it in gradually without stirring. When it 
boils again take it to the table and star in the remain- 
ing sugar and after that the flaToring. Drop por. 
tions the size of quarter dollars on sheets of paper. 
They slip of the paper when cold. It may be nec- 
essary to add another tablespoonftil or two of sugar 
to glTO (be drops coosistency enough not to run on 
the paper, yet it is better to be too thin than too 
much the other way. 



288 e. Wintergreen Drops. 

The same as the preceding, but make them pink 
with a few drops of coohineal or yegetable red color- 
ing and use wintergreen extract for flaToring. 
These drops hare a smooth surface but are slightly 
granulated inside. CIoto drops, cinnamon drops, 
etc., same way. 



286 f . Honey Nonfat. 

A moist candy to be sliced, wrapped in way 
tissue paper. 

4 tablespoonfuls strained honey. 
2 ounced almonds, blanched. 

1 pound flour of sugar, or icing sugar. 
Make the honey hot without boiling, stir in the 
sugar a little at a time until it becomes too firm,then 
turn out on the table and knead in more sugar and 
also the almonds, which must be diy. When the 
nougat is firm enough to keep its form in a square 
bar like a brick split leng'h wise, sugar the ou'side, 
roll it in wax paper and keep it a day before slicing 
it up for sale. Wrap the little outs likewise in wax 
paper. 

888 ff. Tatti-Fnitti Oandy. 

Take the preceding receipt and add to it a tea- 
spoonftil of vanilla, two figs cut small and an equal 
amount of raisins seeded and cut; work up into a 
bar with all the fine, powdered sugar necessary to 
make it firm, cut in flices and wrap in wax tit-sue 
paper. 

288h. Walnut Oreaxns. 

1 pound fine icing sug^r. 

2 heaping teaspoonfuls powdered gum arabic. 

5 tablespooifuls water. 
8 dozen walnut kernels. 

1 teaspoonftil extract Tanilla. 
Put a little sugar in the water to make a eymp, 
and the gom in it, stir oTor the fire until the gum is 
dissolved . Take it off and work in the powdered 
sugar gradually with a wooden paddle. Add the 
yanilla. The more it is stirred and beaten with the 
paddle the whiter and finer the oandy becomes. At 
last turn out (he lump on to the table — it is like 
soft white dough — and roll it in one long roll, cut 
off slices, stick a half of a walnut kernel in each 
piece and pinch the paste up to hold it, by shaping 
it in the hollow of the left hand. Lay the fini^hed 
creams on a tray to dry. This makes about 6 
doten. The sugar is not boiled, only the hot gnm 
syrup is used. 

288 L Date Orecuns. 

The same as the preceding kind with dates cut m 
pieces to use instead of walnuts.

2 tablespoonfuls currants, mioced. 
1 teaspoonful lemon pxtract. 

DisspWe the gum in the water hot and stir in the 
sugar gradually, flayor, firuit end cocoanut. Work 
the paste on the table with sugar until it is firm 
enough, cut off pieces and roll into baUs a little 
larger than cherries. Sugar well outside and let 
dry. The si me can be msde with candy colored 
pink. The foregoing kinds are sU easy to make be- 
cause there is no boiling of sugar. 



388 XXL Ooooanut Oream Squares.

8 ounces cocoanut either flresh grated or desL 
Oated. 

1 small half cupful water. 
Set the sugar and water oyer the fire in a smal^ 
brighttkettle and boil about 5 minutes, or until the 
syrup bubbles up thick and ropes from the spoon, 
and do not stir it. Then pot in the cocoanut, stir to 
mix, and when it begins to look white pour it im- 
mediately into a shallow tin pm. As soon as it is 
set solid mark it off, and cut in little squares when 
cold. The same kind may be colored red, and also 
be made with chocolate. 



288 n. Oomxnon Boxed Mao€ut>ons. 

12 ounces almonds. 

8 ounces granulated sugar. 

4 ounces flour. 

4 eggs. Pinch of salt. 

1 teaapoonful ammonia.

sauce, then put in tne glue mo and lemon juice and 
cook at the side of the range about 16 minutes. 
Color a portion of it pink . When nearly cold mould 
it into any form and roll in powdered sugar. 

The aboTc compound is the cheap gum drop of the 
street Tenders. 



288 p. Frosted Ghrapes. 

Take grapes of two colors^as red Tokays and white 
Muscadels, and pull the bunches apart into clusters 
of three or four grapes each. Prepare a platter with 
the sort of pulTerized sugar known as fine granula- 
ted, and make it warm. Whip some white of eggs 
in a shallow bowl, dip the grapes in it, lay them on 
the sugar and sift more sugar on top. Lay them on 
sie?es to dry.

DiTide some bunches of grapes into small clustert. 
Put into a deep saucepan 
1 pound of sugar. 
1 large cup of water. 
} teaspoonftil cream tartar. 
Stir to dissolve the sugar, then set it on to boil as 
if for candy. 

When the syrup has boilea lO minutes try a drop 
in cold waser. ^hen it sets so that it is hard to 
press between fioger and thumb and the edges of 
drops are hard and brittle it is ready. 

Take it from the fire, dip the clusters of grapes in 
(without CTer stirring the candy) and lay them on 
dishes slightly greased to dry. Should the candy 
become set in the kettle it may have a spoonftil or 
two of water added and be made hot again. 



288 r. Frosted Oraiifires. 

Make plain white icing and use it to dip orange 
slices in just when it has become too thick with 
beating not to run off, and yet thin enough to settlis 
to smoothness. . Haye a long splinter or skewer 
ready for each one. Stick the point of a skewer 
into the edge of the orange section, dip into the 
fronting, push the other end of the skewer into a 
bowl of silt, audlet the pieces hang over the edge 
of the bowl in a warm place to dry.

Small PastrlB 

We hsTe bow to take ap and oonolade the list of 
small iMMtriea that was dropped in order that the 
book of ioes might appear in the rammer season. 

230. Shell Pie8,orVol-aa-vents of Fruit. 

Grasts of pies that may be baked beforehand and 
filled with stewed froit only as required. 

Corer the pie pan with a thin rolled sheet of puff- 
paste, not made thinner in the middle as for other 
pies but left of eren thickness and smooth. Cut a 
mark half way through the paste all round the rim 
of the plate, with the point of a knife and also score 
across the midd*e. When this crust has been baked 
the lid formed by the cutting can be lifted off in two 
halTCs and replaced when the pie is filled with fhiit. 

240. Apple Tumovenk 

Sometimes served as a '<sweet entree ;" . more suit- 
able to pur in place of pie ; best for luncheon, pic-nic 
partie9, and for sale; a ftkTorite form of pastry 
cTerywhere. 

Make the flaky pie paste with about 12 ounces of 
butter to a pound of flour, roll it out to a thin sheet 
and cut out flats nearly as large as saucers, with the 
lid of a baking powder can or similar cutter. 

Place a good spoonftil of dry stewed apple in the 
middle of each piece of paste and double oyer in 
half-moon shape. Press the two edges together and 
crimp them with the thumb and finger. When the 
the baking pan is ftiU of the turnovers brush them 
over with egg and water and dredge granulated 
rogar on top. Bake slowly till they are crisp, 
glaied, and of a fine reddish brown color. These 
• large dies ha'TC generally to be cut in two. They 
contain more fruit and are better eating than when 
made small. 

241. Caimelone of Fniit. 

Proceed as if for apple tumoTcrs, but cut the 
sheet of paste into squares. Place a spoonftil of 
any kind of firm fruit jelly lengthwise and roll up 
the piece of paste so to cover and inclose it. The 
word oannelon, like caoe, signifies a tube with a pith 
in it. Egg over, dredge with sugar and bake. 

242. MinoePattie& 



Roll out a sheet of pie paste, or puff paste if pre. 
ferred, very thin. Cut out flats with a large biscuit 
cutter. Put a spoonftil of mincemeat, or lemon 
mincemeat, or mock mincemeat, on one of the fla's, 
lay another on top and pinch the edges together all 
round. Egg them over, dredge, sugar and bake. 



243. Lemon Patties. 



May be made as above and filled with the lemon 
butter, number 89, or lemon paste. 



244. Saratoffa Shortcake. 

Drain the juice from canned strawberries into a 
quart measure. To a quart allow 12 ounces of ragar 
and pet it at the back of the range to simmer down 
as thick as ft-uii jelly. Then pat in the strawberries 
and cook a short time longer. Roll out two thin 
sheets of ordinary flaky pie paste and bake them 
on two baking pans of the same site. When dee 
spread the strawberry compote on one sheet, pUoe 
the other sheet on top— moving it by means of two 
palette knives slipped under — and over the top of 
that spread a coat of thin cake icing. Dry the 
icing in a slack oven and let it acqaire a little pale 
color. Cut in squares or diamonds when cold. 

246. Almond Shortcakes. 

Chop 1 pound of blanched almonds quite fine and 
mix with them 12 ounces of sugar and the whites of 
8 eggs, making a Sort of paste. A little orange or 
lemon zest may be added. Cover a baking pan with 
a thin sheet ot pie paste, spread the almond paste 
evenly over it and cover with another thin sheet of 
pie paste. Egg over the top, dredge sugar over and 
bake in a slack oven. Cut in oblongs or squares 
when cold. Several of the nut creams and conserves 
may be used in the same way instead of the minced 
almonds. With a coating of icing or glase on top 
the articles of this class made of pastry are found to 
be very saleable at the bakers' shops. 

246. Florentinee or Florentine Mer- 
ingues. 

Cover a baking pan with a sheet of pie paste 
rolled out thin. Spread over the paste some green 
gage jam, strawberiy jam, or fruit jelly, and bake 
it in a slow oven. While it is baking whip up the 
whites of ttom 6 to 12 eggs, and when firm spread it 
over the hot preserve. On top of t he white of egg sift 
some granulated sugar and some desiccated oocoaout 
should be strewn over that. Bake the cake about 
10 minutes more with the oven door open. Cut in 
squares when cold. 

247. Enfflish Oheesecakea 

12 ounces of sweet rennet curd. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

Pinch of salt. 

^ a nutmeg grated. 

Lemon extract to flavor. 

To prepare the curd see number 808. Rub the 
curd as taken from the draining cloth through a 
flour seive and mash it smooth. Add the other in- 
gredients and pound them all together. Line patty 
pans with tart paste and nearly fill them with the 
mixture. Bake about 16 minutes. The curd mix. 
ture though seemingly too firm at first melts and 
pufis up in the oven. Powdered sugar over the tops.

267. Fried Pies. 

Saleable in the baker's shops. Make them the 
same as directed ft>r apple tnmoTers with dough not 
Yery rich. Use milk to mix up with aod the dough 
will h%Te a better brown color thaa wiih water. 
Wet the edges with egg and water to make them 
stick and keep out the grease. Drop the turooTors 
into a pan of hot lard and fry them brown like 
faitters or doughnuts. 

268. German Pancakes. 



This is an antiole specially belonging to the restau- 
rant bill of fare, for its only difference from com- 
mon pancakes or good wheat flour batter cakes is in 
its being baked thick ; nearly as thick as the omelet 
pan is deep; and such a cake almost constitutes a 
a meal by itself. They hsTO usually to be mixed up 
at short notice. The following is the quicnest way: 

1 pint of milk to mix up with. 

10 yolks of eggs. ^ 

4 ounces of melted butter — 8 basting spoonftills. 

2 ounces of syrup — 1 basting spoonful. 
Little salt. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

1 pound or quart of flour. 

1 pint more m*lk to thia it down. 

Put one pint of milk ia a pan and all the other 
things with it. Stir hard, rubbing the soft dough 
smooth and free from lumps, and then add more 
milk gradually. Put a spoonful of hot lard in the 
small omelet frying pan, pour In about a ooifee cup. 




All of batter and bake it light brown on both sides. 
Serve with butter and syrup. These cakes are 
richer made with the yolks only than when the 
whole eggs are put in. 

269. French Pancakes— "Jenny Lind 
Pancakes " 

1 pound of flour. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

14 eggs. 

} pint of milk. 

I large spoonftil of melted bntter. 

1 pint of cream to whip. 

Half cop of brandy. 

Little salt. 

Separate the eggs and mix the yolks with the milk, 
throw in the sugar, butter, brandy and salt, then all 
the flour and mix up smooth. Whip the cream and 
mix that with the batter, then whip the whites and 
stir in. Bake thin pancakes in omelet pans. Being 
swt et they bum easily. When done on both sides 
spread a spoonfUl of currant jelly on the pancake 
and roll it up like an omelet. Sifc powdered sugar 
on top. Or, roll up plain and serre a little jelly in 
the dish For cheaper kinds see wheat batter cakes. 



260. Petits Pates— Small Patties. 



A delicate sort of small patties haTO the crust 
made by frying the coating of batter that will adhere 
to a solid copper shape that is dipped into it, by im- 
mersion in hot lard. The shell can be shaken off 
when done and the copper wiped and dipped in the 
batter again for another. The batter will not adhere 
if the copper shape is made too hot. The German 
pancake batter or that made tor waffles will answer; 
the best for the purpose is the French frying batter 
made with oil and wine. Fill the shells with chicken 
or partridge or other minced meat. 

The copper shape will hardly be found ready 
made Get a copper bolt made into the outward 
shape and size of a yery small fluted tumbler, but 
solid, and a handle a foot or two in length fastened 
in the top to dip it by.

2 poaods of butter or lard* 4 oupfnls. 
2 teispoonfnls of salt. 

1 quart of ice water. 
More flour to duet with. 

Rub the butter into the flour dry between the 
hands. Use salt onlj when lard is employed for 
shortening. Make a hollow, pour in the water 
mix up soft, and roll out on the table. 

It makes the cake flaky and part in layers to 
roll it and fold it a few times like pie paste. 

Roll out as thick as biscuit at last and bake on 
jelly cake pans. Split them open, spread apple 
cream thickly between and powdered sugar on top. 

.262. Apple Oream. 

4 cupfuls of grated apple. 

2 cupfuls of sugar. 
Butter size of an egg.

using a tin grater and scraping oflf with a fork 
what adheres. Squeeze in the juice, scrape out 
the pulp, chop it, put in the water and boil. Mix 
the sugar and flour together dry and and stir them 
into the boiling liquor. When half thickened take 
it off and let finish in the pies. 

The aboye makes two large pies or three small. 
It is necessary to be particular to get the right 
amount of flour. The mixture is pale yellow from 
the rind and sugar. 

For the crust rub half a pound of shortening 
into a pound of flour, mix with cold water and 
roll out three times. Put top as well as bottom 
crust on these pies. 



264. MaocLTOon Ocike. 

Often incorrectly ca led macaroni cake. A spec- 
ialty at some of the fine bakeries. 

It is a sheet of cake with macaroon paste baked 
on top and fruit jelly in spots. For the cake take 



1 pound of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

6 eggs. 

1 small capful of milk. 

1 taaspoonfnl of baking powder. 

Flour to roll out — about 2 pounds. 

Warm the buUer and sugar and stir them to- 
gether to a oream, add the eggs two at a time, 
then the milk, then the powder and moat of the 
flour. Work the deugh on the table by pressing 
out and folding it till it can be rolled out to a sheet. 
Roll it thin as.iffor cookies, out to the size of your 
baking pans, roll up the piece of doagh on the 
rolling-pin and unroll it on the pan, preyiously 
well greased. Bake Tery light colored and not 
quite done, because it has to be cooked again.

Little lemon extract. 

Stir the aboye ingredients together in a bowl, th< 
sugar and whites first and the cocoanut added. 

Place the paste, either with a teaspoon or with 
a tube and forcing-sack, in long cords across the 
sheets of cake, and then diagonally across to form 
diamond-shaped hollows. The cord of macaroon 
paste need be no thicker than a pencil. Then liakt 
in a slack oyen with the door open till top is brown. 
When cold drop spots of clear fruit jelly in th< 
hollows between the ridges of macaroon paste. 

266. Macaroon Tarts. 

Line small patty pans with sweet tart paste, 
half fill with macaroon paste, made either with 
grated cocoanut or minced almonds, and bake 
slowly in a yery slack oyen. The insides rise round* 
ed and partially hollow. 



267. Napoleon Oake. 

Roll out two sheeis of puff paste quite thin and 
bake on baking sheets. 

When done spread pastry cream (No. 285) upon 
one sheet, place the other on top of it, and finish

A Book of Pufb, Eolairs and Oream 
Fillixifirs. 



Sooner or l&ter it was morallj cerUin these 
things would get into the papers ; the common dark- 
ness surrounding the subject and the many inno- 
cent deceptions practiced for that reason makes this 
necessary. 

For bills-of-fare may promise fidrly enough, but 
there is not the least certainty that the promised 
puff fritter will come to table puffy, and it is differ- 
ent with it than with almost anything else in this 
world ; we are accustomed to speak of hollow ftnuds 
and hollow mockeries, but a puff fritter is only a 
fhkud when it is not hollow, and you can neyer 
properly call a puff fritter your "solid," unless it is 
a solid mockery of what it ought to be. 

There are at least a dozen cooks in Sleepy Hollow 
who can not make puff fntters hollow, and possibly 
the most of them do not eren know what they are, 
and yet would resent any hint that they are not 
first-class cooks. But they are not the only ones. 
There was a cook of considerable repute, who ran for 
seyeral successiye seasons on that splendid steamer, 
the Aberbrothock, and he made it a point to have 
what he called bell fritters, for one of his "sweet 
entrees" always for the last dinner of the trip. 

He went through the motions of making puff frit- 
ters, and he made a nice spongy sort of an article, 
but nobody could see why it was called bell fritter, 
because it wiu not "hollow as a bell," and had not 
eyen a space inside big enough to hang the smallest 
kind of a clapper. But one day, by some accident, 
he got the proportions just right, and, to his aston- 
ishment, when he dropped the fritters into the hot 
lard, they presently began to swell. The pieces of 
the paste he dropped in were as big as goose eggs at 
first, which was entirely too large in any case, but 
he had not been used to seeing them increase much. 
But this time they swelled and they swelled, and by 
the time they had attained to the size of canteloup 
melons, and the two at the bottom had hoisted all the 
rest and were about to pitch them over, the cook 
was thoroughly scared ; he thought Old Nick was 
inside them, and, hastily seizing the saucepan by the 
handle, he threw'it and the whole caboodle out of 
the cook-house window. 

Puff fritters, or, rather, the want of them, was the 
cause of a good deal of unhappiness at the Scylla 
Cottages, for several years. 

There is not a more delightftil winter resort than 
the Scylla Gottagesf on the dreamy Southern coast. 
It is noted the world oyer for its location iipon the 
rery verge of Percival's beautiful coral grove, where 
the purple mullet and the gold-fish rove, and is only 
a two hours' easy boat-row from the Isle of Calms, 
where the sea throws up some new and exquisite 
tropical shells every day, and Morris's folks, in pen- 
sive thought, can wander on the sea-beat shore in an 



atmosphere of perpetual Spring. But there had to 
be some eating done even in Eden, and the Scylla 
Cottages were kept as an hotel by an estimable land- 
lady. She prided herself upon her life-long experi- 
ence in housekeeping. 

Her regular patrons from the North, wh o arrived 
punctually each year just before New Year's, had 
discovered a spell to keep her in subjection. "What 
society shall we have this year? Whom do you ex- 
pect?" — and then — "Have you found a cook yet who 
can make those delightful souffle fritters? Oh, they 
make them so elegantly at Long Branch ! And you 
did not succeed with the receipt we sent you ? Dear 
me — and we procured it from one of the most cele- 
brated cooks, it must have been right. Why, they 
make them over there at the Charybdis Hotel, per- 
haps as elegantly as our cooks do at Long Branch, 
and that is quite a splendid place, the Charybdis, 
but we seem to have become attached to this spot 
O, if you only had a really good cook I" 

Of course these intellectual people were not in- 
earnest ; nobody cares for a fritter, more or less, but 
they knew that in this way they could infuse gall 
and bitterness into somebody's life, and when they 
were good natured they played the subject for sport, 
and when they were really mean through eating too 
much green turtle, they rung the changes for pure 
spite. They would even go over for a day or two to 
the Charybdis Hotel, which is r^lly a very fine 
place, with splendid shell roads uid two-forty nags 
to drive on them; magnificent rows of magnolias, 
fig orchards and oranges ; but, being a literary 
and artist sort of crowd, they better liked the aU 
mosphere of the Isle of Calms, for "the nightingales 
sing round it all the day long," and the Southern 
sunsets from that point are most gorgeous. 

As to the Charybdis Hotel fritters, they were hol- 
low, it is true, but they were little, old hardshell 
things, and whenever they were served the guests 
had to be furnished with nut-crackers to break them 
with. And yet, that cook was so proud of them that 
he guarded the secret of making them from the 
boys as carefully as if he had discovered a new 
Aladdin's cave. 

He needed not have been so careful. If there 
were any use of it, no doubt but as many as fifty va- 
rieties of hollow fritters could be made. The key to 
the whole matter is this: 2TO. 

If you make a very stiff, smooth, cooked paste of 
flour, then work in gradually about half its weight of 
raw eggs you have a fritter paste that when dropped 
in hot lard will swell, and each piece become as hollow 
as. an egg shell. Any other substance, com starch, 
corn meal, banana pulp, fruit pulp of any kind, cheese, 
almost anything smooth will act the same way, either 
alone or mixed with flour. We shall have more to 
say about this when we come to souffle pudding 

But these simple foundations are not particularly 
good eating, and have to be enriched. Their tenden- 



ea 



THB AXBRICAN PASTBY OOOX. 



07 to puff up is already at the strongest, and what- 
eyer is added must be so balanced — more eggs against 
more butter and sugar — as not to destroy it. In 
things like these requiring exact proportions it may 
make a difference if the eggs used be unusually large 
or small. There is no magic in the number ; it is 
weight you want. Ten eggs average a pound. And 
it may make a difference, too, if the water be aU 
lowed to boil away after being measured. 

The receipt next^foUowing gives the kind that was 
made by the Charybdis Hotel cook, and which he was 
so afraid lest anyone should find out. They used to 
be called Baptist fritters, because they are never truly 
good until they have been immersed — in syrup. In 
campmeeting countries where they are sold on the 
grounds by measure, the statute requires them to 
weigh four pounds to the bushel. They can be made 
to weigh less if made larger. The number of eggs 
in the receipt is left optional. The Charybdis man 
only used four because they were dear, and he had 
to careftdly round off the fritters as he dropped them, 
because while the rich kinds will smooth themselves 
in the frying fat, these only come out with all the 
rough comers magnified. You will like them with 
six eggs, and are not obliffed to furnish nut .crackers, 
even with the other proportion. 



9T1. 



Hardshell Fritters. 



1 pint of water. 

} pound of flour. 

4, 5, or 6 eggs. 

Slight seasoning of salt. 

Bring the water to a boil in a bowl-shaped sauce- 
pan of good size ; drop in the flour all at once and 
stir to a firm, smooth paste, which will require about 
five minutes over the fire. Then take it off and, 
after letting it stand a few minutes, work in the eggs 
one at a time with a large spoon. Beat the paste up 
against the side for at least five minutes. It does 
no harm to let the paste stand an hour or two before 
frying, after it is made, but it must not be allowed 
to get cold before the eggs are beaten in. Set on an 
iron frying kettle half filled with clarified meat fat, 
and when that is hot drop in pieces of the paste 
about as large as guinea eggs. Only a few at a time. 
When done, take up with a skimmer ; drain on a 
colander or seive ; serve with syrup. Makes twen- 
ty-five. 



37«. CORN STARCH FRITTERS. 



Balloon Fritters. 



The boss fritters of the tribe. Crisp and fine. No 
limit to their swelling capacity but the size of the 
kettle. When made of the size of footballs the ket- 
tle has to be set in the oven to finish, because they 
merely float on top of the fat and cannot cook 



through. Weigh the starch; don't trust the paek* 
ages for weight. 

1 pint of milk. 

i pound of com starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

8 eggs. Little salt. 

These are made same way as the ^'hardshells,'* 
except that the starch has to be mixed separately. 
Boil half the milk with the butter and salt in it, and 
mix the starch smooth with the other half; pour it 
in the saucepan and stir over the fire till it becomes 
a firm paste well cooked. 

Beat the eggs in one at a time. Have fresh sweet 
lard moderately hoi, and drop in pieces of the paste 
as large as guinea eggs, by pushing them off the 
point of a spoon. They need considerable time to 
ft-y. Serve vrith sauce ; transparent, wine, brandy, 
lemon or custard. Makes about twenty-five or 
thirty.

Fried Puff Borders. 



For individual entrees. Suitable to serve instead 
of Yorkshire pudding with any roasted or braised 
meat having a brown gravy. 

Make either the com starch fritter paste or the 
queen fritter paste next following. Put it in the 
lady.finger sack and press out in piping smaller than 
a little finger, on to a greased tin lid or a baking pan 
of small size. Form the piping into oval rings the 
size required for your individual dishes. When the 
frying fat is ready, turn the lid upside down with 
the rings on it and dip them in the fat. They will 
immediately slip off and retain their shape whUe 
frying, but puff considerably. Where many are 
wanted at once, a baking pan does best to fry in, a 
smaller sized tin pan that will go down in it being 
used to make the shapes on. Instead of forcing sack 
and tube, a half sheet of stiff paper, made into a 
cornet, pinned, and the point cut off, will do*

the "'sh. 



The two following are the kinds that they made so 
elegantly at Long Branch. *

would be better English than puff fritter, but com- 
mon usage seems to sanction the latter.

Boil the water and butter together in a bowl- 
shaped saucepan larfi^ enough to beat the mixture 
in. Put in the flour all at once and stir over the 
fire till jou have a firm, well-cooked paste. Take it 
from the fire, let it stand to lose a few degrees of 
heat, then work in the eggs one at a time with a 
spoon, and beat the paste well against the side of 
the saucepan. Fry same as the other varieties. 
Thej maj be glazed by sifting powdered sugar on 
them and melting it by setting in the top of a hot 
OTen, or else with a red hot salamander or shovel, 
held over. May be served also with raspberry vin- 
egar, lemon juice and sugar, custard, or any pud- 
ding sauce. The receipt makes forty to fifty. 

None of these fritters require any such thing as 
soda, or baking powder, or any substitute as is often 
absurdly directed ; neither do the eggs require beat- 
ing, otherwise than in the paste, as described. 

These remarks apply as well to all the baked pufis, 
eclairtf talmotueSf etc., of similar character. 

When any of them fail to puff up as expected, it 
usually requires another egg in the paste. There is 
a certain point of softness when the paste will al- 
most run out of a spoon, but not quite, that is the 
best for lightness, and is soon learned byjpractice. 

9T5. SPANISH PUFF FRITTERS. 



Beigaeta Souffles, a la Vanille. 

All the preceding kinds are unsweetened and 
cook light colored ; these contain sugar and require 
care to prevent their becoming too dark in frying. 

1 pint of water. 

7 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of sugar. 
10 ounces of flour. 

6 eggs, or 7 if small. 

2 teaspoonfuls extract vanilla. 
Boil the water with the butter and sugar in it, put 

in the flour and make the fritter paste same way as 
directed for the preceding kinds, adding the va- 
nilla with the last eggs. 

Fry in good lard slowly. They may be five min< 
utes before they begin to expand. Take them out 
with a skimmer ; drain on a colander ; dredge pow' 
dered sugar over and serve. Enough for average 
orders of fifty persons. 

Fritters fflacis mu rhum, or otheiwise, are fritters 
glaztd, either with a thick sugar syrup flavored with 
rum (a rich pudding sauce) poured over them, or 
else powdered sugar melted on the fritters in the 
manner before described.

light brown; drain on a colander; split them all

met is to be served hot for dinner, should be baked 
for the purpose, with sugar and batter, or else 
stewed in syrup. If to be served oold, preserved or 
brandy peaches can be used.

Bell Fritters. 



This is the way they were made by the cook of 
that splendid steamer, the Aberbrothock, when he 
made them right and threw them out of the cook- 
house window in alarm because they swelled. 

1 pint of water. 

8 ounces of butter, or lard. 

8 ounces of flour. 

5 eggs, or 6 if small. 

Make as directed for queen fitters. Good lard is 
preferable to bad butter. 

What do you do with the stale pieces of bread that 
are left over so abundantly, wherever there is an 
abundant table set and people pick and choose so ? 
Good bread; n t thorough, unshapely biscuits spoiled 
with inferior yellow baking bowder, top crust blis- 
tered and bottom crust soiled, so brittle and coarse 
that they crumble in the fingers, go down like saw- 
dust and leave a taste of soda and salt butter in the 
mouth, but nice slices of white bread, good rolls, 
flaky biscuits, fine gnuned muffins. There are about 
three-score-and-ten needs and uses for such as these 
in good cooking. In half of them nothing but bread 
will do, in the other half bread makes a good substi- 
tote for something else, as in this receipt.

take the paste from the fire and beat in the eggs one 
at a time as for other fritters. 

This makes a good fHtter, but less certain to be 
hollow than others; depends on the fineness of the 
bread. 



The next, made by a different method, is one of 
the most delicate preparations of the potato. But 
there are potatoes and potatoes. It would be labor 
thrown away to use any but the best flavored and 
mealiest for such a purpose.

Beifirnets de Poxmne de terre. 



Potato puree and eggs beaten light and fHed. Hors 
d' auTre, (side dish) or vegetable garnish for en- 
tress, or sweet entremet with brandy sauce. 
1} pounds of pared raw potatoes. 

4 ounces of flour. 

4 tablespoonfuls of cream. 

Same of whi<e wine or sherry. 

6 whole eggs and 4 yolks. 

Juice of half a lemon. Nutmeg. 

Boil the potatoes well done in salted water, drain 
dry and mash them thoroughly — ^better through a 
colander. While still warm, mix in aU the other 
ingredients except the flour. Then set the pan or 
bowl in ice-water and beat the mixture 15 minutes 
or more, like making sponge cake. When light stir 
in the flour. Fry small spoonfuls, egg-shaped, in 
hot lard. Drain on paper. Serve hot. Makes about 
60. Not hollow, but very light. 



281. Transparent Fritters. 



Crisp. White. Good to use up whites of eggs 
left out of mufiins, custards, etc., wherein they do no 
good. Serve with red wine sauce, or lemon juice 
and sugar. 

J pint of milk, or water. 

3 ounces of butter, or lard. 

8 ounces of corn starch. 

J pound of white of eggs (9 whites). 

Make as directed for other starch fritters. Fry 
slowly. If the batter is beaten too much after the 
whites are all in, the fritters are liable to explode 
when near done. (They never explode on the table 
— no danger.) 



We now come to cheese puffs and creams. In the 
great majority of instances when anything made 
with cheese appears in a bill of fare, the kind named 
is Parmesan. Besides this, the cook is directed to 
use various other foreign cheeses, according to what 
the purpose may be. In Italian cookery, one writer 
observes, "several varieties of cheese are much em- 
ployed : such as the cheese of Switzerland and Sa- 



voy, under different names; and Parmesan (named 
fh>m Parma), though it is made in all the north of 
Italy, and particularly in Lombardy. Gruyere 
cheese is, however, most used throughout Europe; 
Parmesan is twice or thrice the price out of Italy. 
In Italy, a platefUl of grated cheese is mostly served 
with the soup, when each guest takes what he likes 
and mixes it on his own plate." 

Another writer says: "My friends had two sur- 
prises of which I myself had not thought — Parmesan 
served with the soupe, and a glass of dry madeira 
after. * These were two novelties lately imported 
(into France) by Prince Talleyrand, the first of our 
diplomatists, to whom we owe so many wise and 
witty saiyings, etc.'* 

Every well r^ulated hotel storeroom of course has 
all the different varieties of cheese on shelf, properly 
labeled, so that the cook can have all the world be- 
fore him where to choose. But those who live where 
it is found difficult to obtain anything but American 
cheese, if they have not already read it, will begraU 
ified and interested in reading the following, tr m 
"Practical Cooking and Dinner Giving." 

"Among the best cheeses of England are the Stil- 
ton and Cheshire ; of France, are those of Neufchatel 
Brie and Roquefort. The iromage de Roquefort is, 
perhaps, one of the most popular of all cheeses. The 
Gruyere cheese of Switserland is also a well known 
cheese. It is made fh>m new milk, and flavored 
with a powdered herb. The Roquefort cheese is 
made of a mixture of sheep's and goat's milk. The 
Parmesan (an Italian cheese) is made of skimmed 
milk. It is a high-flavored and hard cheese, and is 
not oent to market until it is six months old, and is 
often kept three or four years. It is extensively 
used, grated, for cooking. 

Our American cheeses, since .ne introduction of 
the factory system, are exported in immense quanti- 
ties to England, where they are much ought for, and 
considered by epicures as great luxuries. This is 
generally astonishing to Americans abroad, who, at 
home, often consider it only in rule to offer guests 
cheese of forei£;n manufacture. 

» » » « » « 

Perhaps the cheapest of the foreign famous cheeses 
is the Neufchatel. It comes in little rolls about an 
inch thick and three inches long, is enveloped in tin- 
foil and costs about twenty cents a roll. 

The tariff may be saved by purchasing the Neufchatel 
manufactured in New Jersey and Westchester County, 
New York. As for that, the Stilton made in Cayuga 
county can hardly be dected from the Leicestershire 
manufacture itself; and in fact, nearly all the famous 
cheeses are very perfectly imitated in America, so that 
those who choose may indulge in foreig^n names and 
encourage home manufacture at the same time." 

The moral to be drawn fVom the preceding ax- 
tract is that for cooking purposes at least, American 
cheese will do very well, even for dishes au Parme- 
tarit or d la Parme$ane.

Parmesan Fritters with Apples. 

i pint of water. 
1 ounce of butter. 
4 ounces of flour. 

4 ounces of cheese. 

5 or 6 eggs. 

Grate the cheese, if dry enough, or else mince it 
extremely small. 

Make the pu£f fVitter paste by boiling the water 
with the butter in it and then stirring in the flour. 

When well cooked take the saucepan from the fire, 
add the grated cheese an d beat it into the hot paste 
with a pestle. Then work in the eggs one at a time 
and beat the mixture for several minutes. Fry 
smal fritters. They swell very much and are not 
good if dark colored. When done, drain them — on 
paper if necessary — open each one with a twist of a 
fork, and put in a teaspoonfUl of dry-stewed apple 
seasoned with fresh butter. When the cheese is of 
a very dry sort, a little more butter is needed to 
make the paste. 



The receipt preceding and the next to follow have 
been rehabilitated from some of those delightAilly 
▼ague instructions for making Italian or other dish- 
es, which say, "take a glass of water and a handful 
of cheese and a pounded anchovy, and some flour, 
and eggs enough to make a paste not too thin, etc " 
The anchovy is for flavor and can be added or not, 
at pleasure. 



983. lUuneqiiin PufGst. 



Make the cheese fHtter paste of the foregoing re- 
ceipt. 

Cut some manilla paper in broad ribbands, and 
brush them over with a little melted lard. 

Form the paste in ring shapes on these papers, by 
pressing it out of a paper cornet, or a sack. 

These are not slender rings, but more like flat 
cakes with a depression in the centre. 

Draw the bands of paper through the hot frying- 
fat and the puffs will slip off. They should be fried 
of a light color. Drain, then split them as you 
would mufiins, and spread between some creamed 
cheese or fondue. Dredge a little gra ed cheese on 
top, and set the pan containing them in the top of 
the oven for two minutes before serving. Care is re- 
quired in forming the shapes not to have them too 
large, as they expand considerably.

About Olarifyiner "Frying Fat. 



A number of articles have now been described in 
this column that have to be fried by being immersed 
in hot fat, enough at least to cover them. As it may 
be a long time before they will have to be mentioned 



again, a few explanations here come in place. 

When the clear fat — possibly several inches deep 
— is skimmed off the top of the soap stock boiler and 
strained into a frying kettle, it looki clear enough 
and ready for frying. But in fiict it contains a good 
deal of water and gelatinous matter that must be got 
rid of. 

When it is set on the range it soon boils rapidly, 
and inexperienced persons are apt to think that it 
is then ready to receive the articles to be fried, but 
if they are dropped in a^ that stage they only boil all 
away to a mush, and perhaps the grease foams over 
on to the range. If, however, the grease is allowed 
to continue boiling — it may take an hour — the water 
will all be expelled and the gelatinous matters, or 
gravy, will all be found coated over the bottom of 
the kettle. The grease is then motionless and will 
soon begin to smoke — it is hotter than boiUng water. 
If now poured off into a clean saucepan, it is clari- 
fled and ready for frying in, and may be set away to 
get cold and used whenever wanted without any 
more preparation. 

If, instead of pouring it into a clean saucepan, the 
articles to be fried are put into the grease in the same 
kettle it was boiled down in, they will dissolve more 
or less of the sediment on the bottom, the grease 
will become turgid and foam over and take fire, and 
instead of the articles browning they are apt to stick 
on the bottom and the whole contents acquire a 
burned and smoky taste. Hence the necessity of 
clarifying all fat that is saved from the cooking of 
meats. 

When meats are baking in the oven, all the 
fat that may be taken out as long as there is water 
in the pan is in precisely the same condition as that 
taken from the soup stock, and contains meat gravy. 
It is then what is called drippings. 

But when the meat has become browned and the 
gravy in the pan dried and browned too, then all the 
fat that remains is clarified and will set like tallow 
when cold ; it can be poured from the pan into 
a saucepan direct, and used to try with immedi- 
ately. 

When kidney C^t, or other fat pieces of meat are 
rendered down in a meat pan, they should be treated 
just like the baked meats; cooked with a little water 
in the pan at first, but allowed to dry out and let the 
glaze be fixed to the bottom before the clear grease is 
poured off. 

Articles properly made and properly fried and 
drained after frying have so little grease left about 
them that it is scarcely appreciated; but what they 
are liable to have about- them are sickly flavors of the 
nature of vegetable oils that the frying fat may have 
gathered from other vessels. The bay leaf, onion, 
celery and herbs; the cloves, mace, lemon, or what, 
ever is put in the soup are fine whilst they are liv- 
ing flavors, but their essential oils carried over in 
the fat to the frying saucepan are not so pleasant. 
Therefore the clear fat should be saved before any

lightest kind, but if fried in fat from siuflfed pork or

of will be the ghosts of departed onions. The table 
may be ftimished expensiyely, and the bill-of-fore be 
full of French terms, yet if these little matters be 
thought too trivial there will be an indescribable 
something that will detract from the pleasure of eat^ 
ing at your table. If fkt containing oil of onions 
must be used, keep it for frying onions in. Beef 
fat is well nigh tasteless, and is good alone; see that 
nothing goes into the rendering pan that will in- 
jure it. 



Frangipannl-Fraiicripaiie. 



A strange trait it is, but cinlized humanity al- 
ways seems to be ashamed of its subjection to the 
necessity of eating, and is always ready either to 
quarrel with its bread and butter or kugb at it. 
So strong is this tendency, that only a yery few au- 
thors of the utmost independence and decided power 
haye cared to treat of matters of food and drink in a 
serious manner. The nation that is credited with 
being the most highly ciyilixed in Europe, finding 
that all its ciTtlisation did not redeem it from the 
necessity of eating, made the best of the difiiculty, 
and elevated the entire matter to a point of re- 
spect, which the other peoples acknowledge whether 
they understand or not. 

But, "Oh, if we could only liye without eating I" 
is the common aspiration stilL Some &ncifUl story 
tellers hare imagined people living on air alone; 
quaffing the rich south wind as real people quaff 
wine. Others have come down a little lower, from 
airy nothings to trifles light as air. 

"That suits me exactly," says one of Disraeli's 
ladies, "I am a great foe to dinners, and, indeed, to 
all meals. I think when the good time comes we 
shall give up eating in public, except, perhaps, fruit 
on a green bank, with music." 

"It is a pity, my lord," says one of Bulwer's char- 
acters, "that we do not serve perftimes at dessert; it 
is their appropriate place. In confectionery (delicate 
invention of the Sylphs,) we imitate the forms of the 
rose and the jessamine; why not their odors, too?" 

"It is an exquisite idea of yours," said he, "and 
the next time you dine here we will have per- 
fumes." 

It seems likely enough that this very conceit grew 
out of the name, fittngipane, by which the cream or 
custard used for filling puffs is known to French 
cooks. Thackeray, who names a cook Champig- 
non, at the same time calls a milliner Mademoiselle 
Frangipanni. 

Frangipanni was as common a perfume, it ap. 
pears, as eau*de-cologne is now. Savarin, examin- 



ing the causes of obesity, finds his fat neighbors 
showing a partiality for such things as tourU de 
franffipane, which in English is cream pie. Wor. 
cester finds that both these are one word, the 
Italian being frangipanna, frangipane the French, 
but that it means two things— a perfume of jasmine, 
and milk boiled down thick and mixed with al- 
monds. So, as Tommy Traddles would say, "There 
you are I" The people had a perftime which they 
admired, but it would not satisfy hunger, they made 
an almond cream and thought it so good they named 
it perftime. An obvious compromise between ethe- 
rial longings and material needs. And thus it is the 
art of cookery meets every requirement, even 
of the delicate people who really eat nothing at 
all. 

Whatever it may have been, the frangipane of the 
present time is not made with condensed milk, and 
the nearest approach to the old definition is a receipt 
that directs almond macaroons to be brokon up in 
it. The compounds carrying the name are all made 
with flour, and the flavors vary.

FranffipaD 



The kind commonly used by bakers for filling 
cream pufis, etc. 
1 quart of milk. 
8 ounces of white sugar. 

4 ounces of flour. 

5 eggs. Pinch of salt. 
1 ounce of butter. 

I tablespoonflil of extract of lemon. 

Set the milk and butter on to boil. Mix the flour 
and sugar together while dry, very thoroughly, then 
sprinkle them in the milk rapidly and keep beating 
till it is well up to the boiling point again. It is 
worthless if in the least scorched. Move it to the 
side of the range and stir in the five eggs, cover and 
let simmer slowly for twenty minutes, or till well 
cooked. Flavor after cooling. 

ExTBA ToucHBs. — Three ounces of fresh butter 
lightly browned in a frying pan over the fire and 
then added to the pastry-cream, gives it richness, 
and flavor of nuts. Almond macaroons may be 
broken into the milk when first put on to boil. 

Thick whipped cream can be lightly stirred into 
the pastry-cream when the articles to be filled are 
for immediate use. 

When the pastry-cream is for cream pie, or tourU 
de frangipane; or for fauehonettett which are small, 
deep tarts nearly filled with it and meringued on 
top like lemon pies; or for cream cake, the difference 
required is only to use 8 yolks instead of the 5 
whole eggs, and make the cream as usual. The juice 
of a lemon may be added for pies. The whites of 
the eggs make the meringue.

1 pint of clear, yer strong coffee. 
1 pint of cream. 

Use these instead of the quart of milk, and make 
according to directions for common pastry-pream. 

On board ships and steamers where milk for cook- 
ing purposes can seldom be obtained, all the pastry- 
creams are made nearly as good with water. An 
ounce of butter extra is then needed. 



The reader peroeiyes that as cream fillings a yari- 
ety of dissimilar compounds here come together. 
They are alike, howeyer, in being each one adapted 
for seyeral uses, for spreading on toast, cakes, filling 
tarts, tartlets, pies, etc., besides filling cream pufis. 
In another point they are all alike, and one being 
learned the rest become the easier for it. They all 
haye to be stirred oyer the fire till thickened — that 
one touch of cookery makes the whole lot kin. Hye 
different English cook books contain directions for 
making the simple base of seyeral conseryes, to follow 
here presently, that is what is called there transpar- 
ent pudding, and on this side is pretty well known 
as transparent pie. Only two of the fiye giye the 
essential point of cooking the mixture oyer the fire 
before the pies are filled with it, and one of these 
copies yerbatim from the older one, except the 
change of a single word. One says stir till like 
buttered egg8» the other says till like batter. The 
consequence of it is that the mixture put into the 
pies raw will rise and look fine, but when done will 
go down and become like wax; whereas if preyiously 
cooked it remains light and delicious. 

288, Tran8i>arent Pie Mixture. 

Used aiso for pufls and tarts, yariously flayored. 

^ pound of sugar. 

i pound of butter. 

8 eggs. 

Nutmeg or yanilla fiayor and brandy, if desired. 



Melt and stir the butter and sugar together in a 
sauce pan; add the eggs, beaten a little first, and 
stir the mixture oyer the fire till it is half-cooked, 
ropes from the spoon, and looks like soft butter. If 
for puffs or tartlets it may be well cooked and fla- 
yored with orange or lemon. For pies, dredge a 
little powdered sugar oyer the top of the mixture 
when in the crusts — helps to preyent scorching on 
top. Slow oyen. Makes 4 or 5 pies. 



The French name for tarts or little pies, made 
with the preceding mixture and several yariations of 
it, is dariolft. Young Quentin Durward, of Scott's 
noyel, on his first arrival in France, is set down to a 
feast of a choice order, and is served with darioUt in 
the second course. One English definition of dari' 
oU is a custard tart. But the nearest the English 
cooks could come to fitting it with a term was to call 
it a cheesecake. Neither term is appropriate. The 
following, one of the danole fillings, is called in one 
place * 'cheesecake to keep several years." Although 
containing eggs, the keeping qualities of these prepa 
rations are such as to entitle them to be called oon-

Lemon Conserve. 



Also called darioU filling, lemon custard, lemon 
cheesecake, lemon paste, lemon honey, etc. For 
filling small puffs, tartlets, piee, and spreading on 
larger cakes. 

1 pound of sugar. 

6 or 6 lemons. 

4 ounces of butter. 

8 yolks and 1 whole egg. 

Put the butter and sugar in a bright saucepan, 
grate the yellow rinds of the lemons into i^ with a 
tin grater, scraping off with a fork what adheres; 
sqeeze in thejuioe without the seeds, then stir over 
the fire till the mixture boils. Beat the yolks and 
mix them in and stir about ten minutes more, or 
till cooked and thick like melted cheese. 

Lemons that are green, thick-skinned and acrid 
are not fit for this purpose. 

It is a rule useful to remember that these mixtures 
seldom if ever scorch when they have butter in 
them; they may be left to simmer at the side when 
time presses. 



990, Conserve aux Amandes. 



For small puffs, almond cream cake, tartlets, etc. 

8 ounces of almonds. 

\ pint of water. 

8 ounces of sugar.

6 bitter almonds and a little rose extract, If they 
are convenient. 

Scald the almonds and take off the skins, then 
chop them fine. 



THE AXEBICAK PA8TB7 COOK. 



Boil the sugar and water to a thick syrup; stir 
n the minoed almonds and the butter and boil five 
minutes. 

Then stir in the yolks of eggs and take the mix-

8 ounces of grated cocoanut. 

J cupful of milk, or water. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of butter. 

Whites of four eggs. 

Thin pared yellow rind of i an orange. 

Mince the orange peel and boil it with the sugar 
and milk. Stir in the cocoanut, the butter, and 
the beaten whites last. Take the mixture off when 
it thickens. 

The two preceding kinds giye a yellow and a 
white nut cream or conserye, Tery useful and orna- 
mental for spreading between layers of snow cake. 
Pistachios and hickory nuts can be substituted for 
either of the other kinds. Can be thinned with 
milk if too firm when cold. 



It is seldom necessary to keep any such compounds 
as these in hotel work for any length of time. The 
quantities prescribed are for the usual daily require- 
ments of 60 persons. It should be remembered, 
howeyer, that sunlight turns butter rancid, and 
anything containing it should be kept dark in cov- 
ered jars. 



Florida Jam. 



"Florida shall be the name of this new land," 
cried Ponce de Leon, "for, in truth, it is a flowery 
land. What sayest thou Padre Rotundo ?" 

"As thou sayest I say. Florid is* the red-bird 
flitting through the green bushes; florid the flamingo 
in the swamp; florid the sea weeds were that floated 
about our vessel as we passed yon enchanted islands 
set in a luminous sea.** 

"Beautiful isles of the sea," murmured Gonzalez. 

"Beautiful gems of the ocean," sighed Leonardo. 

"Surely," went on Ponce de Leon, "they are the 
veritable isles of the blessed that we thought were 
but fkbles of the ancients, and this is the garden of 
the Hesperides." 

"No gold, no gold," groaned Sebastiano, throwing 
down his prospecting pan and pick, "I have delved 
among the sands of yonder shore and found naught. 
Padre Rotundo, thou sayest these shell mounds show 
that this land was once the ocean's bed, show us, 
then, where lie the wrecks of ancient ships gold- 
laden; or. Padre, show us the streams that flow 
down flrom El Dorado." 

"And if," said Ponce de Leon, pursuing his own 
train of thought, "this be the garden of the Hesperi- 
des, somewhere in its glades exists the fountain of 



perpetual youth. That will I find. Perish thy 
thoughts of gold." 

"I am with thee in that search, Don Leon I" 
exclaimed Leonardo. "Oh, would I were a boy 
again!" 

"Listen to the mocking-bird," said Ponoe de 
Leon. 

"Aye," answered Leonardo, "and the woodpecker 
tapping the old hollow tree." 

"And the voice of the turtle is heard in the land," 
chimed in the oily voice of Padre Rotundo. 

"Land of love and sunny skies, bright with joy 
and beauty." exclaimed Leonardo. 

"Sebastiano, what ails thee," asked Ooniales, 
"why blinkest thou at the sky?* 

"Oh, *tis nothing; but a jay bird sat mi^eetio on 
yon hickory limb, and when he winked at.me should 
I not wink at him ? Perhaps he knows where there 
is gold.*' 

"Gold I believe in when I see it, but in omens 1 
do not believe." 

"I do. I had a dream the other night when eveiry- 
thing was still — " 

"A fig for thy dreams." 

"By our good Saint Augustine,'* said Padre Ro- 
tundo, "as thou saidst figs, we will have some figs. 
Bring me the figs of Smyrna that remain in the 
boat, and we will plant the seeds. Haply in this 
genial land the fig will prosper, and many that oome 
after us shall bless us. Yea, my son, there shall be 
in this land fountains and streams of perpetual 
youth. They shall flow from the North and Weet 
and East, and be of many generations. In magnolia 
parks and orange groves and by the river St. John's, 
eyes shall look love to eyes that speak again; and 
there shall be many a sly flirtation by the light of 
the chandelier in the halls of And 

there shall be gold, Sebastiano. but not for thee. The 
hotel-keepers of the future shall see it. Gold and 
letters of credit ftx>m the frozen North. Golden or- 
anges, too, that shall make this land wear a likeness 
to the gardens of thy native Seville." 

"Padre," said Ponce de Leon, drawing near and 
speaking in a low tone, "dost remember the convent 
garden near Seville, into which we stole, thou and I, 
when we were small boys, to see thy sister once 
more ? And dost remember the spicy breeze that 
was wafted to us from the refectory, where the sis- 
ters were preparing confections and conserves of or- 
ange flowers T And <1ost remember how they caught 
us and made us work till our arms did ache, at 
pounding orange rinds in a mortar; whilst thou 
didst nearly roast at stirring orange jam?** 

"Tut, tut," returned the Padre, "I choose not to 
remember such undignified incidents. Yet if thou 
wilt, thou mayst compare the delicate fimoy of those 
good women for confections made of flowers, with 
the cruel extravagance of the pagan Romans who 
desolated the groves, and made costly dishts of the

toDgiies of thousands of singing birds, and thou 
wilt concede the finer grace of the later day.'* 

But Ponce de Leon had not been listening. His 
thoughts were faraway, and he sighed, "Her bright 
smile haunts me still/

1 pound of sugar. 
4 large oranges. 

2 or 3 lemons— juice only. 
4 ounces of butter. 

6 yolks and 2 whole eggs. 

1 teaspoonful of extract of rose 

Put the sugar and butter in a bright saucepan; 
grate in the yellow rinds of the oranges and add an 
ounce of candied orange flowers, if you have them. 
Squeeze in the juice of the oranges and lemons with- 
out the seeds, and stir the syrup thus made over the 
fire till it boils. Beat the eggs and yolks a little, add 
them and let cook till the inixture becomes thick — 
about ten minutes. Add the rose extract after 
cooling. 

An ancient, cheap, but laborious way of making a 
conserve of oranges or lemons, is to boil the rinds in 
two or three waters for several hours, to extract the 
bitter taste and make them tender, then pound them 
to a paste in a mortar and boil the paste with either 
honey or syrup. 



A large proportion of the area of the Bahama Is- 
lands is devoted to the cultivation of pineapples. The 
appearance of the broad expanse of young fhiit with 
its clusters of delicately-tinted, but sharp and ser- 
rated leaves, rising only a short distance from the 
ground and covering the undulating fields, produces 
a very remarkable eflfect. As many as 1 ,500,000 of 
the fruit have been collected from a single acre

Grate or mince the cheese yery fine; put it and al 
the other ingredients in a saucepan and stir over the 
fire till it becomes thick and just begins to boil; but 
it must not quite boil, as that would spoil it. 

As the good quality of this preparation is depend- 
ent upon its being made only just before it is to be 
served, and cheese grating is one of the tedious 
operations, it will be found, for hotel use, more ex- 
peditious to pound the cheese and butter together, 
slightly warmed, then pour in milk and yolks and 
stir till thickened. Can be used as a sauce with 
Italian fritters, made a triflle thinner.

Cheese Fondu, or Melted Cheese. 



For Welch rare-bits, eanapSt au fromage, etc. 

See preceding receipt for creamed cheese, and 
substitute ale for the milk. Either of the ways an- 
swers for all the purposes of the other. 

For canapSt, spread the mixture on toast, and put 
in the oven three minutes before serving. 

The preceding form of melted cheese is also one 
form of the fondue, which does not come under the 
present category. It may be noted in passing, how- 
ever, that the fondue of which Savarin thought so 
much, was more like a dish of scrambled eggs with 
cheese, having no ale or other liquid added. He 
says it is of Swiss origin, and that the cayenne is not 
to be forgotten, that being a characteristic of the 
dish. He made his fondues, when entertaining a 
few friends, in a chafing dish over a spirit lamp. 
His inile would be singularly inappropriate in an ho- 
tel entertaining five hundred people He says al- 
low one egg for each guest, one-third as much 
cheese and half that of butter, etc. But it illus- 
trates the idea underlying small bills of fare, that 
every person will partake of the one dish, if that 
one dish be made of surpassing excellence. 



The reader perceives that as cream fillings a vari- 
ety of dissimilar compounds here come together. 
They are alike, however, in being each one adapted 
for several uses, for spreading on toast, cakes, filling 
tarts, tartlets, pies, etc., besides filling cream puffs. 
In another point they are all alike, and one being

OREAM FILLING-S.-Ck>noluded. 



If a list had to be made of the articles of pastry 
held highest in popular esteem, oream puffs would 
be found somewhere near the beginning. The pop- 
ular name, Boston cream puffs, might lead to the 
supposition that they are of American origin, but, 
far from it, there is so little in our trade that is new 
that I have a private opinion that Pharaoh's baker, 
the one who befriended Joseph, knew how to make 
them just as well as we do. There are many finer 
and more delicate articles that meet with less appre- 
ciation, and when we find a thing so prone to disap- 
pear, not only from the baker's windows, but fh>m 
well-set supper, lunch and dinner tables, too, as 
cream puffs are, it is the part of g^ood policy to see 
how we can make the best of them. There is more 
wit and humor in these puffs than in anything else we 
make If it were not for this they would be in still 
greater request than they are. Wit is defined as 
something which startles by its unexpectedness. W it 
often runs to practical jokes. When a person eating 
in haste, as the minority do, takes a bite of a puff 
that is filled with a cream insufficiently cooked and 
consequently in a fluid state, and the said cream is 
unexpectedly propeUed this way and that way over 
his apparel, the wit of it may be apparent to all, but 
is sure not to be relished by the victim. This sort 
of wit should be discouraged, to which end the vari- 
ous cautions about the proper preparations of the 
pastry creams have already been given. Humor is 
not so objectionable, and when pure most people en- 
joy it. It is defined as a faculty of kindly pleas- 
antry. The humor of cream puffs is seldom un- 
mixed. 

There is humor, but not of a kindly sort, in giv- 
ing a plate of empty puffs to a hungry beggar and 
watching the falling of his countenance when he 
discovers their emptiness; and there is humor in 
setting a plate of the same before the hotel boarders 
who habitually pick and peel the crust off eveiything 
before them— off the bread and rolls and com bread 
— the tops of the pies— the brown outside from all 
the meats — but this is humor of the kindly sort, as 
it makes such people happy to have something that 
they may peel, and be welcome, and leave no waste 
behind.

To the best bakers who make mem in large quan- 

tities daily, there is nothing easier than cream puffs, 
but it is not the less true that they are **mighty un- 
certain'' where made only occasionally and baked 
in the uneven heat of a cooking range, instead of an 
oven. 

A very ordinary workman, I once knew, traveled 
as a first-class pastry cook from town to town on the 
strength of a knack he had of making these trifles in 
greater perfection than anybody else. It was his 
one trick, but it stood him in good stead for short 
spells. 

The more the paste is beaten up against the side 
of the pan as the eggs are added, and after, the more 
the puffs' will expand in baking. 

When they are perfect they are nearly smooth and 
look like small cauliflowers, whence, perhaps, comes 
one of their French names. To make them so, the 
paste must be almost soft enough to run out of shape 
on the pans; another egg may be required. 

It is safer to use a little less lard or butter and a 
little more flour than the receipt, for a first trial. 

The puffs will not rise at all if the paste be al. 
lowed to become cold before the eggs are beaten in- 
to it. 

The handsomest puffs are those baked done with- 
out the ove** door ever being opened in the mean- 
time.

Make the desired number of cream pufis of

They are not to be filled with anything. They

after baking, first in thick sugar syrup and then in 
grated oocoanut mixed with granulated sugar on a 
plate. Dry the puffs in a warm place, that they may 
not be sticky when served. 

To make the syrup, pour half a cup of water on a

The English ruralists are great at making cheese- 
cakes in variety. A kind of tart made of sweet milk 
or cream curd is the genuine sort, and holds about 
the same relative importance at the well-provided 
tables of the better class that pumpkin pies do on 
this side. The scarcity of English culinary terms, 
however, has made cheesecake a name expansive 
enough to take in a number of French knick-knacks, 
such as the following, which only come in turn be- 
cause they are cream curd puffs. 

»08. 

Nothing can be made of milk curd, successftUly, 
unless the curd be scalded to firmness so that it can 
be pressed dry; a point that our receipts, as we find 
them, hardly ever mention. Curdle the milk or 
cream with rennet as if for cheese; then set the pan on 
the range and slowly come to the boiling point. Pour 
off the whey and hang up the curd in a napkin to 
drip dry, and then slightly press it. That is what 
is meant by *<well.prepared, firm curd," and a num- 
ber of good things, to be descrit)ed at some other 
time, can be made of it without fear of disappoint- 
ment.

The Best Minoe Pies in the "World. 



It is not so difficult to make good mince-meat as 
to make the pies healthful and enjoyable after it is 
made. Mince pies, too frequently, in hotels where 
the desire is to make them rich, are made so that 



they are little better than dabs of sweetened grease. 
The finest puff-paste is not suitable for them, but a 
medium quality should be made. The edges will not 
rise on mince pies much in any case, and rich puff- 
paste is lost upon them. They have the poorest ap- 
pearance of any pies if baked plain, but can be 
made most inviting by being glased, 

But don't paint them with yellow smears of egg- 
yolk. Mix the yolk of an egg thoroughly with 
twice as much water; brush the tops of the pies over 
with it before baking; sift a very thin coating of 
granulated sugar all over, and then bake in a mod- 
erate oven till the bottoms are baked dry and light 
brown, and the tops are covered with a crisp, glased 
crust. Minoe pies should have both bottom and top 
crusts rolled quite thin; otherwise the superfluous 
pastry edges are invariably thrown away. 



800. Mince-Meat a la Royale. 

Strictly first-class in all its appointments. 

2 pounds of lean roast or boiled beef. 

2 pounds of suet. 

2 pounds of apples. 

2 pounds of currants. 

2 pounds of seedless raisins. 

2 pounds of brown sugar 

1 pound of candied citron, 

2 ounces of ground spices — ^mace, nutmeg, cinna- 
mon and cloves. 

1 or 2 cans of Bartlett pears, with the juice. 

2 pounds of preserved ginger 

12 oranges — juice and grated rind. 

6 lemons— juice and grated rind. 

1 pint of rum. 

1 pint of brandy. 

1 quart of port wine. 

Chop all the ingredients small. DonU grind 'them 
in a machine. Then mix everything together — ^the 
dry articles first, and liquids poured over them. Put 
the mince-meat in jars, cover close, and let stand a 
week or two before using. 

When preserved ginger cannot be had, boil half a 
pound of common race ginger in syrup made with 2 
lbs. of sugar in 2 quarts of water. When boiled 
down to one quart, put the syrup in the mince, and 
further extract the ginger flavor by pouring the 
port wine upon it and making warm. This ginger 
is not to be used in the mincc-meat, only its ex- 
tracted flavor. 

When the oranges fUrnished are ripe and thin- 
skinned it is better to chop half of them after 
squeezing, and add them to the mince, instead of 
only grating. Grate the rest and use the juice of 
all after excluding the seeds.

The spirit eyaporates in baking. 

4 lemons. 

2 pounds of white sugar. 

2 pounds of currants. 

1 pound of seedless raisins. 

2 pounds of suet, 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices. 

^ pint of brandy and port-wine mixed. 

Use lemons that are ripe thin-skinned, not harsh 
and bitter. Boil them in a quart of water till the wa- 
ter is half boiled away. Then squeeze the juice into 
the sugar, throw away the seeds, and mince the 
lemon rinds small. 

Cut or chop the raisins, mince the suet fine and 
mix all the ingredients together. Keep in a coyered 
jar. 

The crater the lemons were boiled in should be 
added to the mince. This quantity makes about 20 
pies, according to size. 



3U. English Standard Minoe-Meat. 



2 pounds of lean roast or boiled beef. 
2 pounds of suet. 
. 2 pounds of apples. 
2 pounds of currants. 
2 pounds of seedless raisins. 
2 pounds of brown sugar. 

1 pound of candied citron. 

i pound of orange or lemon rinds, preyiously boiled 
tender. 

2 ounces of ground spices — mace, nutmeg, cloves 
and cinnamon. 

8 quarts of sweet cider. 

1 quart of common brandy. 

Chop the meat and suet fine, and season them 
with a little salt and pepper. Cut the citron in 
small bits, mince the lemon rinds, and chop or cut 
the raisins. Mix all together and let stand two 
weeks before using. If too dry, wine, cider or 
brandy, or all mixed, should be added when the pies 
are filled. Candied orange or lemon peel, of course, 
can be used instead of the stewed peel, but costs 
more and gives less flavor. This is enough for 50 or 
60 pies, according to size. 

With a standard like the foregoing receipt to start 
from, anyone can vary the quality and cost of mince 
meat, according to circumstances. Apples in excess 
make it poor and insipid. Raisins, currants and 
orange peel, and wioe or sweet cider, make it rich. 
The meat is only a foundation. Cheap mince-meat 
is made by dosing with ground spices, and leaving 
out the more expensive materials. 



319. Qood Ck>nimon Minoe-Meat. 



2 pounds of minced beef or tongue. 

8 pounds of suet. 

4 pouunds of currants. 



8 pounds of apples. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 pound of brown sugar. 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices. 

1 pound of candied citron, or the same of oraage 
and lemon rinds boiled tender. 

1 pint of common brandy. 

8 quarts of cider, or enough to make it juicy. 

Put the raisins in whole. Mince all the rest, sea- 
soning the meat and suet a little with salt and pep- 
per. Should be kept 8 or 4 weeks before using.. 
Makes about 40 or 50 pies. 

Nothing is saved by buying trashy currants. They 
have to be well washed and picked over free Arom 
stones, and the more dirt there is the more will wash 
away. Some currants are like small raisins, nice 
and clean and large. There is no waste in them. 

To Clean Currants. — Put them into a colander 
with holes not too large; set that down in a pan half 
ftill of warm water and stir the currants about vigor- 
ously. The dirt will go through the holes. Pour 
the water away two or three times. This is the 
quickest plan and most thorough. Spread the cur- 
rants out in a baking pan; pick them over and let 
them dry for use. fti^ 

To Clean Raisins. — When sultana seedless are 
furnished, or even the larger kind of seedless rais- 
ins, put them in a colander with a handful of flour - 
mixed in, and rub off the fine stems, which then by 
sifting about will &11 through the holes. When the 
greater part have been so got rid of, the raisins must 
be picked over separately, especially to remove the 
gravel stones that may chance to be among them. 
Layer raisins have to be seeded to be good in any- 
thing. A most tedious operation and requiring such 
help 'as can be had. 



Some thirty years ago the English Vegetarians 
made a good deal of noise in the world. Their head- 
quarters was in the Channel Islands, where their 
representative paper was published. It was called 
the Vegetarian Banner and Manx ffealthian Journal. 
Its motto was ''Fruits and Farinacea, the Proper 
Food of Man." Its leading idea was, that absti- 
nence fh)m meat diet would make the world better. 
Those who supported it set themselves to work earn- 
estly to get up a new system of cookery wherein 
meat should have no place, and a great many curi- 
osities in the way of bills-of-fare of dinners without 
meat were published in it in consequence. The an- 
nexed is one of their receipts. The cider excepted.

317. Finffer Bisouits. 

14 ounces of granulated sugar — 2 cups. 

8 eggs. 

6 tablespoonfuls of water. 

12 ounces of flour — 2 heaping cups. 

Separate the eggs, the whites into a good sited 
bowl, the yolks into the mixing pan. Put the su 
gar to the yolks and stir up then add the water and 
they can be beaten to a thick foam. It may take 
10 minutes. Have the flour ready. Whip the 
whites with the wire egg-whisk till they are firm 
enough to bear up an egg Mix the flour in the 
yolks and stir in the whipped whites last. 



Lay the mixtare in small finger-lengths with a

place until they are firm enough to bear up an egg, 
add the sugar and flavor and beat a few seconds 
longer. Put the meringue paste thus made into a 
sack and star-pointed tube or else into a stiff paper 
cornet having the point cut like saw teeth and press 
out portions sise of walnuts on to pans slightly 
greased and then wiped clean. Bake in a very

-ram HOTEL BOOK OF FGrDDINQS* 



GonsideriDg with what relactance the public are 
said to read prefaoes, it seems quite fortunate that 
puddings are such familiar things and there is nex 
to nothing to be said about them; and, besides, thej 
constitute such a remarkably numerous family — race 
Bums called it — that if only they all have to speak 
for themselves there will be quite a time. And that 
reflection alone must give us pause, for among them 
are some such hoary patriarchs, Tenerable relics of 
antiquity, as would hardly brook any levity from us 
the creatures of yesterday. Suppose one should say 
to some of these old respectabilities, "You old rel- 
ics, you are heaTy, you are indigestible; you are a 
black, unwholesome lump; you should be made over, 
shaken up, renovated like an old hotel; would they 
not rise up and annihiliate us with, 

'Pass, little mortal, pass, 
Thy days are but as grass.' 

But we were 

'Formed ages since, perhaps before the flood. 
We nurtured the stout dryads of the wood.' " 

Erery one mcst have obserred how natural it 
seems for artists to draw pud iings with faces, es- 
pecially Christmas plum puddings — depend upon it, 
there is something in it. If it would be such a 
heinous piece of presumption to attempt to change 
the nature of the old plum pudding, is it not almost 
as bad to change its form ? There is not much poe- 
try about pud dings, but what little mite there is belongs 
to the old time round pudding boiled in a bag. The 
tall fellow in fine fluted moulds is an upstart. A 
writer in the Baiar — it may be three years since — 
traced back the plum pudding to its infancy, when 
it was only porridge — a sort of porridge with plums 
in it; but it grew out of that, and although occa- 
sionally through the accident of coming untied in the 
kettle it relapses temporarily into it8 early state, it is 
respectable and to memory dear only as a pudding 
round and solid. In the sanctum where these lines are 
written— one that is next neighbor to all out of 
doors, looking off "where wilds immeasureably 
spread seem lengthening as you go" — there is upon 
the wall a picture from Harper' t Weekly of a Christ- 
mas at sea — "the pride of the ship's cook." He is 
carrying the plum pudding himself to the captain's 
cabin; none of the boys may touch that. The pict- 
ure is huDg up a little askew in order to straighten 
up the cook. It makes but little difference which 
way one hangs a picture of a yessel on a rolling sea, 
but the cook looks a little reeling, and that pudding 
must be kept right side up at all hazards. Let no 
one entertain the least question about that pudding, 
it is the traditional sort, dark and solid and round, 
and the holly is sticking in the top; the glossy, 
sharp-spiked, red-berried English holly; brought 



from shore when the Yessel started and carefully 
kept for the day. Who could dare lay innovating 
hands upon the composition of that ancient pud- 
ding ? Here it is.

^SnffUsh Boiled Plum Puddincr.

2 pounds of chopped suet. 
2 pounds of seedless raisins. 
1^ pounds of currants. 

1 pound of citron. 

2 ounces of mixed ground spices — cinnamon, mace, 
nutmeg and cloves. 

Mix all the above dry articles together in a pan. 

Then mix the following -fluids : 

1} pints of milk. 

\ cup of black molasses, large measure. 

8 eggs. 

1 pound of common yellow sugar. 

\ pint of brandy. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Then stir both mixtures together. This should 
be prepared over night, and next morning tied up in 
four or five pudding cloths and boiled without inter- 
mission six hours.

Some persons have hardly a speck of reverence 

for the antique, and had as lief add something to the 
time-honored English plum pudding as not, if they 
find it makes it lighter, more enjoyable and more 
digestible. Such people can add to the preceding 
receipts two pounds or less of fine white bread 
crumbs, and to the fluid part a half pint more milk. 
That is all, but it makes a difference. 

The quantity of pudding prescribed is enough for 
100 to 150 persons — that is to say, of persons having 
hotel dinners to eat besides. 



880. 

The addition of molasses to the preceding, and 

other puddings to come, is for the purpose of giving 
with the spices a dark color, but when refined 
syrups only can be bad burnt sugar must be added 
for coloring. Not only cooks but many others like- 
wise ought to feel grateful to Count Albufage Cara- 
mel, of Nismes, who iuTcnted caramel. It is used 
for giving a brown color to an immense number of 
eatable and drinkable articles, and is not only harm- 
less, but gives an agreeable flavor in some cases, as 
in creams. Put some sugar in a frying pan over the 
fire, let it bum darker than browned coffee, then fill 
up the pan with water; boil and strain. 



But there is another plum pudding, called in 
French bills-of fare poudin^ a /' AlUmande, which all 
who practice it will prefer to make nine times to the 
preceding kind once. It contains no flour, and can 
be boiled in half the time of Christmas pudding.

In deference to the temperance principles of some 
of their guests, the best hotels make it a rule to pre- 
pare two sauces for plum pudding, one being with- 
out spirit, the other the customary brandy sauce, set 
on fire just as the dish is sent in, or else the equally 
approved tauee tahayon. 

Another one of those revered patnarohs whom it 
were almost sacrilege to touch is Burn's, with <*hon* 
est sonsie fkce," the haggis. In the English plum 
pudding, however, there is a grim, unmistakable 
identity that is very satisfying as compared with the 
shadowy indefiniteness of the Scottish chief. It is a 
pity that one of the last minstrels, if only one of 
humble rank, did not fix unchangeably in verse the 
component parts of the national haggis, as some one 
has done the "Eve's pudding." and Sydney Smith 
did for his salad, and another did for mulled wine. 
We have a compound called haggis, without the pre- 
ceding article, composed of meat, chopped ancho- 
vies, eggs, bread, sour wine, pepper and salt. But 
that does not seem to correspond with the remarks 
of an editor of Bums, who says the haggis was to 
Scotland what the plum pudding is to England, 
and it was the pride of her people that all the in- 
gredients and even the bag it was boiled in were of 
native production. 

It was either the Edinbur|;h Magazine or Tham- 
ber*s Mitcellany that published the following receipt, 
used on anniversary occasions in the best Edinburgh 
hotels and said to have been contributed by a Fife- 
shire landlady, who obsenred, however, that the rich 
made the hnggis as good as they liked but the poor 
as good as they had means. We will not be too pre- 
sumptions, but call this a haggis. The hagg^ may 



yet exist, "great chieftain of (he pudding 

but in his makeup he will be found like a highland 

costume, not successfully transplantable. 



889. A Sootoh Haffffis- 



A kind of mince pudding, of the boiled plum 
pudding order, made with a large proportion of 
meat. 

A calf s heart and tongue~2} pounds. 

1 pound of chopped suet. 

1 pound of flour. 

1 pound of bread soaked in 

1 pint of milk. 

1 pound of chopped apples, or raisins. 

1 pound of white meat of chicken. 

6 eggs. Salt to season. 

} pint of home-made currant wine. 

1 tablespoonAil of mixed ground spices. 

Cook the heart and tongue half-done, then mince 
quite fine. Cut the breast of chicken in thin strips. 
Mix all the ingredients well together, the dry arti- 
cles first. Tie up in two pudding cloths and boil 4 
hours. 

Butter, sugar, and half cup of vinegar, all made 
hot and beaten together, for sauce. 



The great nugority of all the best puddings made 
are of bread, either wholly or in part. The next ia 
a good every day sort. 



888. Baked Bread Pudding. 



2 pounds of white bread slices. 

2 quarts of milk, or milk and water. 

4 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of white sugar. 

4 eggs. 

Nutmeg. 

The bread should be quite free from any dark 
crust. Spread the butter on the slices and then out 
them in dice shapes. Mix milk, sugar and eggs to- 
gether and pour over the squares of bread in the* 
baking pans. Bake till set in the middle. Any 
pudding sace will suit 

** Hotel puddings," said a gentleman of good 
judgment and extensive experience of hotel and club 
life, for whom the writer was to prepare a little 
complimentary dinner,* **hotel puddings I never eat 
nor do I care to offer them to friends. They are al- 
ways too sweet — nothing but sweet— cloying — too 
sweet and rich at first, then further spoiled by a 
sauce all sugar. How can hotel cooks be so dull as 
not to see that they spoil their own work ? Now I 
had a woman cook in New York whose efforts in that 
line were a perfect contrast to what I had found at 
hotel tables If you know of any pudding that is no^ 
an hotel pudding, you may add it to the list." 



THE AlCEBICAN PASTBY COOK.

There are no puddings that are not hotel pud 
dings. As in the case of English p urn puddings we 
follow old patterns too much, and oTerleap the mark 
trying to make the rich enough richer. 

884. Baked Bread Oustard. 



MADEIRA WINE SAUCE. 



2pr€ued in quarts of white bread crumbs. 

2 quarts of milk. 

4 ounces of butter melted. 

4 ounces of white sugar. 

1 lemon. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

Crumble the bread fine, either by grating or chop 
ping. Grate the rind of the lemon into it and 
squeexd the juice into the sugar. Beat the yolks of 
eggs and add them and the sugar to the milk, then 
the melted butter, and pour over the bread crumbs. 
Stir up well, turn it into two buttered milk pans and 
bake about half an hour. Buttering the pans allows 
of I he brown outside being taken out clean instead of 
sticking to the pans and going to waste. In this 
cheap, simple and excellent pudding, as in many 
others, the whites of the eggs would do no good; the 
pudding is richer without them. They can be used 
for other purposes 

885. 

The reader is adTised to note the preceding re- 
ceipt for bread custard, as several acceptable varie- 
ties are made by certain additions, as 

BAKED CITRON PUDDING, CREAM SAU( £. 
RAISIN PUDDING, PT. WINE SAU« E. 
CURRANT PUDDING, LEMON SAUCE. 

Made by adding one pound of either of those or 
other suitable fruit to the preparation. The fhiit 
must be strewn over the top after the puddings are 
in the pans; they sink to the bottom if stirred in. 
Pass a spoon over. to press the fruit slightly under, 
otherwise it comes out in black blisters. There is 
as much in oareftil baking as skillfUl making. 



Another use of the same mixture is for 
880. Bread Pudding Souffle. 

Or Bread Soufle. For this make the bread custard, 
but instead of baking stir . the mixture in a sauce- 
pan over the fire till it thickens and becomes like 
paste. Take it off, and when cool enough not to 
cook them add 6 or 8 beaten yolks. Then beat all 
the whites that have been left over to stiff froth, and 
stir them into the mixture. When this is baked it 
rises high above the top of the pan or mould. 

88T. Puddlnffs Souffles. 



It simplifies the making of puff puddings to re. 
member that nearly all sorts of puddings that are 
made with eggs, and many cf the pie mixtures, such 



as cream pies and cheesecakes and lemon and pump, 
kin and cor a starch custards, can be changed into 
twtfflSt by a very simple process which is the same 
with all kinds in the main, only slight differences 
haying to be made according to the various mixtures 
used. Pudding %ouffliz are of but little value for 
ordinary hotel dinners which run on for hours, be- 
cause they must be sent to table the minute they are 
done, while still puffed up, otherwise, when they 
have fallen, they are not so good as common pud- 
dings. But for dinners on the European plan, for 
parties, for dinners in courses and for individual 
service — anywhere that there can be a set time for 
serving the pudding these light trifles are much es- 
teemed. 

What is required to be done is to take the mix. 
ture already prepared for a baked pudding or cream 
pie and stir it over the fire till it assumes a pasty 
consistency, then add to it some beaten yolks of 
eggs raw; after, that the whites whipped firm and 
perhaps a little brandy. Then bake the finished 
mixture either in large moulds or pudding shapes, 
if for a party dining together, with a band of but- 
tered paper pinned round to make the mould higher 
— to be removed before serving— or, in small cups, 
silver scallops or shells, to be served in indiridua! 
style, or else in littl» paper cases made for the pur- 
pose. These little cases can be bought cheap, ready- 
made in the cities. They need to be buttered and 
baked slightly before using, to harden them. Cus- 
tard cups so used can be set in a pan of water while 
baking and need not be [made hot enough to spoil 
them; these little puddings bake in 16 or 20 min- 
utes. 

The mixtures so treated puff up either hollow or 
very spongy, and must be carried to table in that 
condition. Smooth mixtures like bread puddings 
and com starch or rice flour compounds puff more 
than rough.grained sorts,[such as coooanut creams or 
rice pudding. The pastry creams used for filling 
pufiis, also lemon] honey, pine apple conserve and 
the like, that are already cooked need only to have 
firom 4 to 6 yolks added and then the whipped 
whites to make the richest possible soufiles. Flavor- 
ings and brandy or wine are to be added according 
to taste. 

With these general explanations covering the 
whole matter, onlf a few examples will be given here 
and there as we go along. 



838.

INDIVIDUAL PUFF PUDDINGS. 

First make the fhbDgipane pastry cream : 1 quart 
of milk; 2 ounces of butter; 4 ounces of flour; 8 
ounces of sugari 6 eggs. Mix sugar and flour dry; 
stir into the boiling milk; cook awhile, then add the 
eggs, and simmer 20 minutes.

When this is partly cooled beat the yolks of 6 eggs 
and stir them in a little at a time; flavor with lem- 
on, yanilla or cinnamon extract Then whip the 
whites of 8 eggs quite firm and stir them in lightly. 
Bake either in cups or paper cases, 10 to 15 min- 
utes, in a brisk oven. , Sift on the top of each some 
powdered sugar flavored with Tanilla powder or 
lemon zest. No sauce required. The chocolate pas- 
try cream, and others to be found in <*Cream Fill- 
ings" can be used in precisely the same way. 

839. 

Bciked Brown Bread Puddiziff. 



POUDING A LA QOTHA. 



2 full pressed quarts of graham bread crumbs. 

2 quarts of water or milk (8 cups). 

4 ounces of molasses (2 cooking spoons). 

4 ounces of butter. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. 

Have the bread finely crumbled; melt the butter 
and mix it with the milk, eggs and molasses; stir all 
together and bake half an hour. 

The natural lightness of the bread counts for qual- 
ity in all these puddings, and it should not be de 
stroyed by either scalding or heating. 

Serve the precediog with honey and butter di- 
luted and made hot, or else with any good pudding 
sauce. 



Soufile puddings, it has been remarked, are not 
adapted for hotel dinners long drawn out, but they 
are Very handsomely replaced by meringues, which, 
— but stay; the Boston publisher's pudding must 
not be forgotten. Blessedf is the hotel guest whom 
the waiters delight to honor. The publisher was one 
of these — sojourning in a beautiful winter city — but 
whether it was a real Spartan like abstemiousness of 
habit or whether there could be nothing good out- 
side of Boston, all their efforts were thrown away 
until 

"Ha ! now you are bringing me something I 
Uke." 



840. Boston Bread PuddincTi 



WITH BRANDY SAUCE. 



2 pounds of bread in slices. 

i pound of butter — best fresh. 

2 quarts of milk. 

^ pound of sugar. 

4 whole eggs and 4 yolks. 

1 pound of clean picked currants. 

i a nutmeg, grated. 

Have the slices f^ee from dark crust. Spread 
them with the butter and place in two layers in two 
puddiog pans, with the currants sprinkled between 



and on top. Beat and mix the eggs, sufpir. milk 
and nutmeg together, pour over the bread, cover the 
puddings with either buttered paper or bread crusU, 
and bake about half an hour. To be good, this pud. 
ding must have plenty of custard in proportion to 
the bread, and be baked late and served hot. 

Lemon transparent sauce answers as well as 
brandy. 

* < They say' ' that we in hotels run too much to baked 
puddings and not enough to boiled and steamed. It 
need not be so. They, the complainants, are prob- 
ably English, Germans and Scotch, who all are ac- 
customed to puddings boiled rather than baked. 
The last boiled pudding we had was Scottish. Where 
else in old Scotland did we see a nice person making 
a boiled pudding, a favorite cosmopolitan sort not 
National in character ? Of course it was not Meg 
Merrilies stirring the witch-pot which so terrified 
Dominie Sampson, hun gry as he was; nor Flora Mac 
Ivor; nor Die Vernon; nor George Sands' s French im- 
itation of her, yet it was some one with a family resem- 
blance to them, only there was the dash of sea waves 
somewhere about. Mirando keeping house for Pros- 
peru in the island cavern in ihe Tempest ? No. Two 
young people cooking wild ducks on an island in 
Foul Play ? No; milder, further north, among 
cliffs and wild fowl. Noma, of the FitAil Head ? 
No; but near by in Scottish waters. It was Madcap 
Violet on board a yacht making an apricot jam 
puddiog, a real roly-poly pudding for the captain, 
and all hands if there were any besides Apricot 
jam pudding is real good. Green apple rolls are 
rather more popular on this side. Does Mr. William 
Black really wish it to be understood that over there 
the wealthy railroad builders' daughters all know 
how to make puddings ? This one, it seems, made 
her jam pudding with a heart ache; a very poor 
mixture; too heavy; baking powder is incomparably 
bet er, as you shall see. 

Boiled fruit rolls have the great recommendation 
of not requiring either milk or eggs in their compo- 
sition. Nowhere are eggs so lavishly used as in our 
American hotel kitchens. They are usually cheap 
enough, and if not it is best that articles requiring 
eggs should have enough to make them what they 
ought to be. but the need is, for times of scarcity, to 
cultivate a knowledge of articles of a plainer sort. 
These roll puddings and other plain combinations of 
flour and fruit are used everywhere in England. 
The Frenchman serves them at the best tables as 
le pouding TouUj or Ka ponding d V AUemande, or, d 

r Anglaite, 
when made with preserves or jam. 

Not many can, and perhaps not many try, to make 
the paste for boiled rolls as good as it is capable of 
being; but when good it can safely be said that none 
of our richest puddings are more in request than 
these following. 



THE AKBBICAN PASTBT COOK.

841. 



BoUed RoU Paste. 



It is required to be m light and dry-looking when 
boiled, as bread or biscuit, and to peel apart in 
flakes It is made in the same general manner as 
puff paste, but to secure the flakiness must be rolled 
only 4 times. No shortening nor powder to be rubbed 
in, but all to be rolled in layers. The softer the 
dough can be, to roll well, the better will be the 
pudding. 

2 pounds of flour. 

1 pint of water — ftiU measure. 

1 teaspoonfiil of-salt. 

} pound of firm, cold, sweet lard. 

4 teaspoonAils of baking powder. 

Butter can be used instead of lard, and the salt 
omitted. 

Lay aside a large handful of the ^ourto dust with. 
Pour the oold water in the middle of the rest of the 
flour and mix carefully to hare it smooth. Turn 
the dough on the floured table, work it very little, 
spread it out by rolling; drop the lard in lumps an 
inch apart all over, sprinkle the salt on that, sift a 
little flour OTor, fold it in three, and count that one 
turn. RoU it out again, spread two tea8poo^s of 
powder oyer it dry like so much flour, fold oTer and 
count two. At the next rolling spread on the rest 
of the p3wder, and one more rolling and folding, 
making four times, finishes it. Common short paste 
and biscuit dough can also be used for roll pud. 
dings; also biscuit dough improTed by hating shorts 
ening rolled in. 

349. Boiled Ghreen Apple Roll. 

Pare and slice enough good cooking apples to 
make two quarts when minced. Chop them in a 
bowl and use without cooking, to spread oTer the 
paste. 

Cut the paste already made into 4 pieces, roll out 
thin, spread the chopped apples evenly, roll up and 
tie in pudding cloths previously wetted and floured. 
Stick a pin in the middle to prevent swelling open| 
drop into plenty of boiling water and keep boiling 
without check from an hour to an hour and a half. 
Serve with butter and sugar hard sauce. 

These rolls can be steamed as well. The writer 
thinks they are better boiled. Dip each one a mo- 
ment in cold water when taking up, they come out 
of the cloth easier for it. 

313. Batter and Suffar Sauoe. 



HARD SAUCE. 

1 pound of powdered sugar. 

i pound of best butter. 

Nutmeg. 

Warm the butter and sugar sufficiently to mix 
welL Beat them together till perfectly white. 
Orate nutmeg over the smooth top. A fltvorite kind 
of saaoe for any plain pudding. 



844, Boiled Oranl>erry BolL 

2 quarts of cranberries. 

1 pound of white sugar. 

i pint of water. 

Wash and pick over the cranberries, place them 
in a bright kettle, strew the sugar over the top and 
pour the water over that. Put on a tight lid to keep 
in the steam, let them come to a boil slowly. Cook 
about half an hour. Mash through a colander and 
use the pulp for the boiled rolls. It ought to be cold 
before being used. 

All of these puddings are calculated for about fif- 
ty people's orders. 

Hotel oooks dishing up dinner like to sell out their 
wares, whether fish, entrees, pastries or creams, as 
well as people in market. The market varies a lit 
tie in its demands, but in a general way the roly. 
poly puddings finding the readiest sale are the two 
kinds proceeding; after them come 
CURRANT JELLY ROLL. 
APRICOT JAM ROLL. 
PEACH ROLL. 
HUCKLEBERRY ROLL, 
and then one made with molasses mixed with flour 
and vinegar. 



It takes baking-powder to make the preceding ar- 
ticles, but the less shortening. Light and whole- 
some preparations are taking the places of the too 
solid puddings of a little while back. But baking, 
powder cannot be had everywhere, and the cook is 
most independent of circumstances who is richest 
in resources. Other kinds of paste will do well, as 
will be shown further on. At present we are in 
haste tp get up some puddings for Sundays. Before 
getting too far away from them, however, it is nee- 
essary to remark that none of the plum puddings 
intended for boiling are of much account when 
baked, but the following, if carefully baked, will be 
found very satisfactory. 

To crumble bread when it cannot be grated, first 
slice it very thin, then cut in shreds and across in 
small squares. It is the only neat way. Puddings 
with white rough pieces of bread in the middle do 
not look well. 



84MI. Baked Fruit Pudding. 



1 pound of bread crumbs. 

i pound of chopped suet. 

i pound of raisins. 

i pound of currants. 

} pound of sugar. 

1 pint of milk or water. 

8 eggs. Salt. 

1 teaspoonfii! of mixed ground spices. 

1 level teaspoonful of soda 

Crumble the bread small; mix all the dry artidea

with it except soda, which dissolTe in the milk. 
Beat the eggs in the milk and stir up the pudding 
with it, add the brandy last. Bake one hour in 
buttered pans. Cover with paper to keep the fruit 
ftrom blistering. 

What the following pudding has done that it 
should be called the "queen of puddings" no one 
knows, but that is one name it is known by on both 
sides of the Atlantic. Cooks demur at the appella- 
tion, because there is always as good a pudding in 
their lepository as ever was brought out, and each 
one is the queen for the day. However this is a 
pretty pudding. 



84T. Nonpaxeil Pudding. 



JELLY PUDDINQ.MEBINQUE PUDDING, QUEEN 
OF PUDDINGS, ETC. 

1 pressed in quart of whiU bread orombs. 

1 quart of milk. 

} pound of butter melted. 

i pound of sugar. 

1 lemon. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

1 cup of fruit jelly. 

6 whites and 4 onnoes of sugar for the merin 
gue. 

The jelly is to spread' on top after the padding 
are baked. 

Mix all the ingredients preoeding it together cold 
— the lemon grated and squeeied. Bake till set in 
the middle. Take out and spread the jelly over the 
top. Beat the whites of eggs till they will not &11 
out of the bowl turned upside down; stir in the su- 
gar — granulated is best^-and a few drops of flavor- 
ing. Set the puddings back in the oven till the jelly 
on top is at boiling he^t, then spread the meringue 
over and let them stay with the oven doors wide 
open to dry.bake and acquire a slight color. - 



It seems impossible to get along very &st, for now 
there has to be a little talk about meringues. Me- 
ringue (marang) pastels the mixture of beaten white 
of egg and sugar. When we write lemon pie mi- 
ringui, it means that it is meringued. Meringues 
ake a wide scope. The icing and ornamenting on 
cakes is strictly meringue paste. Egg kisses, as they 
are called, are meringues. The diffsrenceB are only 
in the proportion of sugar to eggs. Let us call this 
on puddings and lemon pies soft meringue to distin- 
guish it from frosting. A tray full of saucers of 
pudding of the preceding sort looks very attractive 
when success has attended the making. The pud- 
ding should be shallow in the pan, and the meringue 
should be of about equal thickness; should be firm 
and cut square, only very often it does not do so, 
but falls after baking till it is nothing but a pitiful 



scum. Too much baking is generally the reason. 
Meringue needs only a very slight heat. Another 
thing that spoils meringue is spreading it on cold 
jelly or ftxiit. It never oooks at bottom but dis- 
solves to syrup. Have the puddings or pies baking 
hot when the meringue touches them and it will not 
disappoint you. As to getting the whites to beat up 
light with ease and certainty that can be accom- 
plished by having them cold to begin with, in a cold 
bowl and beaten in a cool place. Fifteen minutes of 
hard work may be avoided by taking this precan- 
tion, and five minutes' beating will do as well. 



The next is a fine pudding to make when you 
have used the last pint of milk obtainable for ice 
cream; for this needs to be made with water, to be 
semi-transparent. 

Lemon Merincrue Padding, with Sweet 
848, Oream. 



1 ftiU pressed quart of bread crumbs. 

1 quart of water. 

6 ounces of finely chopped suet. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

8 lemona— rinds of all, juice of 2. 

8 yolks of eggs- 

\ teaspoonftil of soda. 

Grate the rinds of the lemons into the bread 
crumbs — ^nsing a tin grater and scraping the sest 
from that with a lump of sugar-— also mix in the 
suet. Squeexe the lemon juice into the water, pour 
it over the bread, add the sugar, eggs beaten, and 
lastly the soda in a little water. Bake and finish 
by spreading meringue over the top^made of the 
whites left over — same as directed for nonpareil 
pudding pi'eceding. No jelly needed. For an 
acid pudding like this an extra sweetness and fine 
appearance maybe given by sifting granulated sugar 
on top of the meringue at the moment before putting 
it in the oven — makes a glazed crust. The lemon 
pcdding, of course, can be left plain, without merin- 
gue. Sweetened cream made hot, but not boiled, is 
the best sauce. 



840. Lemon Pudding Souffle. 

INDIVIDUAL LEMON PUDDINGS. 



Make the mixture for the lemon pudding of the 
preceding receipt. Instead of baking stir it over the 
fire in a bright saucepan till it becomes thick and 
pasty. Beat 4 or 6 more yolks quite light and stir 
them in; then beat all the whites left over to a stiff 
frx>th and mix them in likewise. Bake in cups or. 
paper cases. If wished >o ornament these small 
puddings make some meringue and drop a table- 
spoon ftil on top while baking, when done fkwn col- 
or drop some spots of bright red currant jelly on top 
of that. Send straight frt>m the oven to the table, 
as they soon fall.

Already there are two or three wajs indicated of 
'Hopping off" with meringue — plain; with a crust- 
ing of sugar on top; and with spots of red jelly on 
the white; ways that are equally applicable to flor- 
entines, fVuit compotes and othec dishes. The next 
specimen gives another variation. 



* 850. Baked Oocoanut Pudding. 
WITH ORANGE SYRUP. 



1 pound of cocoanut (less if the desiccated is 
used). 

1 f^ll pressed quart of bread crumbs. 

1 quart of milk. 

2 ounces of butter. 
2 ounces of sugar. 

1 lemon, or sour orange. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

Make up like preceding kinds; mix in half the 
cocoanut and bake in two buttered pans. Beat up 6 
whites of eggs, add to the firm froth 6 ounces of 
granulated sugar and the remaining half pound of 
cocoanut. Spread this cocoanut meringue over the 
puddings and bake again very slowly with the oven 
doors open. Cut in squares or diamond shapes and 
serve with orange syrup. 
851. 

There are numbers of good nondescript articles 
which we hardly know where to place on an Ameri- 
can hotel bill-of fiire. 

Their merit is proven by that best of tests, a con- 
stant appreciative demand. A good dinner gets to 
looking incomplete when occasionally they are left 
off. As these articles do not belong anywhere else 
they are by common consent and usage called ''sweet 
entrees*' — which is probably an Americanism — and 
with the entrees they stand, usually bringing up the 
rear. 

As already hinted, these "sweet entrees" are al. 
ways evidently welcome and undoubtedly make a 
difierence in the amount of pastry required after, 
wards. But one of these is enough at a time. ^ Bad 
taste, poor management and poverty of resource 
among meats and vegetables are apparent when a 
bill-of-fare with ten or twelve entrees shows half of 
them to be of a sweet or fkrinaceous character. 
Without the one each day a long line of fovorites, 
such as trvdi fitters, charlottes, rice cakes, sweet 
croquettes, patties, turnovers, rice with apples, pan- 
cakes, etc., etc., cou'd never appear at all. 

This, however, applies only to hotels furnishing 
ftill length bills-of-fare. There are greater numbers 
of houses, both public and private, where any one of 
these sweet entrees might suffice for the pastry 
coune, and this is particularly the reason for here 
describing the charlottes which are oftenest used as 
puddings 



^. itvM charlotte cannot be "thrown together" 
and be good. Its excellence, when carefully made, 



and its cheapness, make it worth the attention here 
given to details. , 



859. 



Apple Oharlotte. 
A LA PARISIENNE. 



Compote of apples, or apples stewed dry and 
sweet, baked between two layers of buttered bread 
and glazed with egg and sugar. 
40 small thin slices of French roUs. 

2 pounds of pared and quartered apples 

1 pound of sugar. 

f pound of butter. 

1 or 2 eggs for glaze. 

Nutmeg or cinnamon. 

Stew the apples soft with three-fourths of the su- 
gar and a pint of water and steam shut in; then 
mash with a spoon and grate nutmeg in. 

Dip the slices of rolls as lightly as possible in the 
butter melted in a deep pan — dip both sides without 
touchingthe salt dregs. Line two bright, three* 
quart pans with them, bottom and sides, divide the 
apple in, placing it well around the sides; lay more 
dipped slices all over the tops slightly pressed into 
the fruit, and bake the charlottes of a nice toast 
color, bottom crusts as well as top. Then with a 
brush wet them over with e^g and water; dredge 
the remaining sugar over and bake ten minutes more 
to glaze. 

To be dished out of the pans; no sauce needed 
unless for pudding, when sweet cream is best. 



For a charlotte to be served whole still greater care 
is needed in baking. Take a deep mould, a six ox 
eight sided cake or pudding mould does. Cut slices 
of bread to fit — bottom, top and sides. Spread but- 
ter rather thickly on one side the slices, dip the 
other side in beaten egg; place them with the butter 
next the tin, fill the inside with the apple compote; 
place the cover of bread on top and bake in a mod- 
erate oven over half an hour. Turn it out carefully 
on to the dish, glaze over with egg and sugar and 
the red-hot salamander and pour round it either 
diluted red jelly or else whipped cream. 

854, Buttered Apples on Toast. 



AMERICAN APPLE CHARLOTTE. 



This can only be made "just right" when extra 
good, easy-baking apples are at hand, because the 
raw apples should be done by the time the bread

side down, in close order in a shallow baking-pan; 
place half an apple or two quarters on each slice and 
bake brown with repeated bastings with a syrup

cinnamon. The apples ought to shine transparently 
without black edges when done. Dish up with an 
egg-slice. 

855, Charlotte a la Marialva. 



Named, probably, after a French cathedral town; 
possibly a monastery. It is a charlotte of the most 
elaborate degree, the bread cut in small fancy 
shapes and placed in patterns, or in fingers lapping 
edges, on the sides of a mould spread with butter. 
Apples and apricots, sugar and butter and fruit 
jelly all stewed down to a paste is used to fi 1. 
Baked, glazed, and wine sauce serred with it. 

The preceding directions and examples apply to 

PEACH CHARLOITES. 
PEAR CHARLOTTES. 
GHARLOTfES OF MIXED FRUITS. 

Almost any kind can be used. The poorest that can 
be used for such a purpose are the mulberries dyed 
with logwood, which are now being sold for canned 
blackberries. Mulberries with their own natural 
color, when mixed with sour apples, are good 
enough. 

Now here, in the next, is another knot to be un- 
tied. Not that the charbtte itself is a knot, else it 
were better cut than picked apieces, but the name, 
"friar's omelet," whence comes it ? The clue in this 
case is fainter than the almost inylsible thread which 
led through the maie to Fair Rosamond's bower. 
Why should a charlotte, or rather, perhaps a mix- 
ture of apples be called an omelet, unless, because, 
it looked like omelet ? And suppose the preceding 
charlotte a la Marialva came from a monastery and 
the English cooks made an ap .le mixture as near 
like it as they could and called it friar's omelet. 
And suppose the French cooks adopted the English 
mixture because it was good and called it English 
apple cake. That is how it seems to have been. 
There used to be a .saying about the longest way 
round being the shortest way home, and another 
about going from home to learn the news. Some 
English names t>eing placed backwards in French 
have come back to our language as new words, as 
canteen from tin can; so in French cook books we 
find that called English apple cake, which in Eng- 
lish on both sides of the Atlantic is called friar's 
omelet. 

Suppose once more that some person out of pa. 
tience with trying to line his charlotte mould with 
bread patterns of leaves, flowers, crosses and hearts 
and diamonds, just crumble the bread fine and 



pressed a blanket like coat of crumbs on to the thick 
buttered sides of the mould, filled that with the foU 
lowing mixture and baked it of a handsome reddish 
brown, why then you have a yerj flur conception of 
the way that many of our good but rough^nd-ready 
American dishes came to be made.

Pour in the apple mixture; cover the top with 
crumbs pressed in; moisten the top with melted but-

Turn the apple cake carefully upside down out of 
the mould and serve it either with whipped cream 
flavored with wine and sugar, (d la chantiUy) or 
with diluted red fruit jelly {tauce auzfruiU),

Are best and easiest made with either the friar's 
omelet mixture preceding, or the apple custard pud- 
ding following; use the deepest gem pans; if fluted 
or otherwise ornamented shapes, so much the better. 
Brush them over with a brush dipped in soft butter, 
coat with bread crumbs, fill and bake like the large 
apple cake. When done have somi? iauee dorie 
ready; mix into it a nearly equal amount of thick 
cream whipped to ftroth, and pour this around the 
charlottes Another way is to place a spoonftil of 
meringue on each one and set the charlottes back in 
the oven on a baking pan to color. Place two or 
three red raspberries on top of the meringue. No 
sauce required.

Here we have reached a boundary line. One step 
more would be out of the domains of pudding and 
over the borders of pie, for the last apple oustard 
with a little milk added makes nice apple cream

"Well, thank goodness, it was not a bread pud- 
ding, for we are so tired of bread puddings." 

"When did we have any bread puddings ? We 
have had queen of puddings, plum puddings, baked 
fruit pudding, lemon pudding, cocoanut pudding, 
charlottes, and souffles and meringues." 

"They all have bread in them, more or less, ex- 
cept the boiled roll puddings, and they are made of 
biscuit dough.*' 

"But they all and many more were made with 
bread, more or less, before our time; and they are 
none of the rough, unsightly bread crust abom- 
inations, but delicate compounds of fine, white 
crumbs." 

"There is no fault to be found with the puddings, 
but don't you see there's no more bread in the 
house ?" 

"Oh, well there are many good substitutes when 
bread cannot be obtained, but you will manage to 
admit just one more that is made with bread, more or 
less, both because it is a boiled pudding for a change, 
and has already once been called by name but never 
appeared. It is one of the best."

I pound of chopped apples.

1 teaspoouful of lemon extract. 

Stir all well together; tie the mixture in two cloths, 
leaving a little room to swell, and boil without stop- 
page 4 hours. When eggs are scarce 5 or 6 will do 
with half a cup of milk added. Butter, nnd sugar 
sauce is suitable; though one says, '*Adam won't 
like it without wine and sugar." 

"Such," says Bulwer, ' is the constant habit of 
young people. They think anything expensive is 
necessarily good." Bulwer was young himself at 
that time, and must have known how it was If the 
obverse was as invariably the case we should expect 
to find but few admirers of the following, which is 
the cheapest pudding made. Certainly it is not the 
case in this direction, for we find no difficulty in 
disposing of large quantities of this pudding of many 
names. However, it must be properly baked, and 
ought to be in a brick oven, otherwise it has no 
goodness at all. The theory of rice pudding is — 
by the way, perhaps you did not know there was a 
theory of rice pudding ? Yes, indeed. This is a 
great day for theories, and there is a pudding theory 
as well as a nebular theory and an atomic theory 
and an evolution theory;_ and as there wil' be unlim- 
ited time to study the others after we are done with 
pudding it is evident the pudding theory should 
stand first. — The rice pudding theory teaches that 
all the richness is derived from the evaporation and 
condensation of the milk. As one pint of rioe will 
absorb three pints of milk and no more, the baking 
has to be so protracted that the jpuddiog is made to 
contain the condensed richness of six pints of milk, 
half of it, the watery part being dried out in the 
oven. As a matter of course the richer the milk and 
the more cream it contains the better it will be to 
start with.

in a slow oven 8 or 4 hours. It may be best to use 
only 5 pints of milk at first, and add the other if 
the time allows the puddings to boil down dry 
enough. Scorching on top may be prevented by 
ooTering with paper preTiouslf greased. Almost 
any pudding sauce is suitable, and so is pure cream, 
but for preference, sauce dorie or golden sauce may 
be taken; it gives the best appearance to so plain a 
pudding.

So, sonny, you say you have a mother to help, and 
you have been trying everywhere and you can't get 
anything else whatever to do, therefore you want to 
get aji.b in the kitchen. Now, don't you see that 
is not at all. complimentry to the kitchen ? Hotel 
keepei-8 have a hard enough time without having to 
nnntend with the leavings and castaways of all other 
occupations and employments. Yet they always 
want smart, intelligent and industrious boys. You 
appear to have sense, perhaps you even have sense 
enough to become a good cook. And you might do 
worse. You will probably live to see the time when 
a man of sense and sensibility will not be ashamed 
in the United States to say he is a hotel cook. And 
we all want helpers of the right sort. Our good 
seconds, whose ways and dispositions we know, and 
who know ours, are continually drifting away from 
us. They are always wanted to go to the head of 



some othar kitchen. They take partnerships in res 
taurants. They open ice crt»m saloons, bakeries, 
railway eating houses, saloons, lunch stands; they 
go as stewards; and some are lost and never are 
found. So there is room for intelligent boys like 
you— if yon are intelligent. Phe keeps you clean 
and decent, doesn't she ? Can you read and write ? 
Yes. Have you worked in a kitchen before — know 
a stock boiler from a chopping machine ? Yes, you 
have worked about a kitchen a little. Good enough ; ' 
now go and make me this rice pudding. You can't 
make a rice pudding ? Oh, yes you can; the finest 
rice pudding you ever saw; just as good as I can. 
Take this receipt; hang it on the nail before you; 
follow it out; you will come out right But observe 
there is not a word tuo much, and every word means 
something. When it says buttered pans it means 
you are to butter the pans before you pour the pud. 
dings in. When it says well washed rice it means 
you are to sure enough wash the rice — ^rub it clean 
in cold water, pick out the specks; pour water on 
and off it till there is no more sign of meal in it It 
is the meal or flour in rice that bums at the bottom 
of the saucepan, not the rice alone. When you have 
made this suooessftilly preserve the receipt. Yon 
will not be a cook or pastry cook because that ona 
thing is done perfectly; it will take you five years to 
learn it a'l, and then there will be just as much more 
that you will never learn. But if you do some new 
thing each day and hold on to the knowledge, and 
observe all that is done around you ypu will have 
gained so much over and above your wages. Count 
it in dollars if you like; one dollar, five dollars; ac- 
cording to the desirableness of the article you have 
learned to produce; according to the difficulty of 
making it which you will have overcome. So in a year 
or two you will have a trade better for you than if 
your daddy had left you a fortune. Now scoot. 
Don't speak to me anymore till I speak to you. The 
other boys will show you where to find the rice, 
milk, sugar, butter, eggs. You will be slow at first. 
We don't allow youngsters to do guess work. Old 
hands may guess, but even they can't always hit it, 
and your ingredients cost money. Afterwards you 
must learn to work fast if you are going to be a ho- 
tel cook. I shall know by to-night exactly what you 
are worth. "For man is man and master of his 
fate." How goes that song ? I will make that boy 
learn it if it can ever be found again. 

<*Tum, Fortune, turn thy wheel and let it turn, 
Thy wheel and thee we neitherfear nor hate. 

Our lands are little but our hearts are great, 
And man is man and master of his fate," 

Or words to that effect.

it and it will not be Tery apt to burn. 

Any of these puddings left over can be used for

transparent sauce flavored with yanilla, or else with 
red wine, wUl be found most suitable. 

As with the bread custard and the plain rice the 
reader is advised to note particularly the preceding 
rice oustard, not only to avoid repetition here, 
which would be a small matter, but because the 
mystery is all removed from the variations when 
the basis of all has once been made.

add to it 1 whole egg and i pound of grated fresh 
cocoanut Mix all, and when the pudding is in the 
pans take 1 pound of pineapple in thin, small slices 
and lay over the top, slightly pressing it in. 

The pineapple, if fresh, should be stewed first in 
a little sugar syrup; then use the syrup to dilute the 
guava jelly for sauce. 

Bake these puddings no longer than till fairly set 



in the midd'e, as the fruit has a tendency to canse 
a watery separation of the eggs if cooked too 
long. Curacoa diluted a little and made hot is also 
a good sauce. 

For the same reason that apple charlottes were in- 
cluded, the following "sweet entrees'* are hero 
placed in succession; namely, because they are used 
as puddings on occasion.

We would never trouble about timbalea in a book 
of puddings if the word was not a stumbling block 
in the way. There are timbales of rice and sweet 
timbates of macaroni, etc., which in effect are orna- 
mental puddings. The word often appears in bills- 
of-fare when it means only rice cakes like the pre- 
ceding kinds. Timbale means kettle drum, and is 
in allusion to the shape of a pudding in an orna- 
mental pastry case. Suppose you take some yellow 
nouilles paste and by means of a mould form a shape

Let there be no mystery about these. Thej are 
little indiyidual rice oakes, bat they cannot be de- 
scribed, only suggested, for they are but the cook's 
notions, and are more than chameleon like, they 
•hange shape as well as color. 

They are of no oonsequenoe^nly passing fan- 
oies. They are unlooked for contingencies; unex- 
pected circumstances; dernier resorts; put in to fill 
up the bill, to decorate and set off the row of little 
dinner dishes before the guest. There are cameos 
and there are stage scenes laid on with a whitewash 
brush; both are^meritorous in their place. When 
the cook is tired of cuttlbg out rice or farina or ta- 
pioca cakea in squares, and dishing up ohar'ottes 
with a spoon, he takes some means of giving to each 
person an uncut, untouched and more or less deoo 
rated trifle in symmetrical shape. The main com 
pound for these little rice shapes is already found in 
the rice cake plain, precediog. A suggestion of ya- 
nation is found in the rioe cake with fruits. Sup. 
pose you take muffin rings, brush them inside with 
butter, coat them with fine grated bread crumbs, 
fill with rice cake, bake brown and serTO a green 
gage plum stewed in bright syrup, or half an apri- 
cot, or three red cherries with the thick juice on top. 
Or, instead of rings, take some handsome stamped 
gem pans, the deeper and more pyramidal the bet- 
ter, and on the buttered sidea place some shapes cut 
with yourfkncy vegetable cutters cut of the greenest 
candied citron, or watermelon rind; or else, instead 
of bread crumbs, use finely chopped yolks of eggs; 
or, instead of any of those, make some noutUes 
paste— which is flour moistened with yolk of egg, 
with a little salt and nothing else, and worked to 
smoothness — and cut. leaves, etc., out of that Then 
place rioe cake round, over the patterns— a sort of 
wall or casing — and inside fill with preserved finiit, 
jam or conserve. After baking these may be turned 
out, glazed with yo^k of egg and milk or sugar, and 
quickly browned again. Sometimes Utile rice 
ca^es, not- sweetened, are baked in the tiniest gem 
pans holding scarce a tablespoonfUl, and are served 
as decorations of entrees, and with fish. 



3T1. Plain Boiled Rioe Puddinff. 



The writer has not found occasion to be much 
concerned about boiled puddings of rice; hotel peo 
pie who require anything so pliiin being amply saU 
isfied with the rice prepared for a vegetable dish. 
If, however, the competition of the other restaurant 
U so severe that one mu-t give good meals for ten. 



or fifteen, or twenty cents, or if there is ChioaM 
help to be f^ a. boiled rice pudding is not so bad 
Besides, we have Dr. Andrew Combe's **Physiology 
of Digestion*' to prove that it is the etaiest of diges- 
tion of all puddings, and therBfl>rd oommended to 
dyspeptics. 

Wash a pint of rice; mix a haadftil or two of 
either raisins, currants or apples with it, tie up in a 
cloth with room enough to swell to three pints; put 
on in cold water and boil about an hour. Syrup or 
molasses for sauce. 

If the foregoing is a <*poor man's pudding," the 
next must certainly be his rich relation's. It can 
be handsomely fumed out of a handsome mould 
and the rich custard poured round It will not be 
good unless the tapioca be thoroughly s a^ed as di 
rected, and may take i pint more milk; the re- 
ceipt is on the safe side for turning out in good 
shape.

Sift the dust from tapioca. Sometimes it is bet- 
ter to wash it, besides, like rice. Soak it in half 
the milk about two hours in a warm place. Boil the 
rest of the milk with the sugar in it — the sugar pre- 
▼ents burning at bottom— oook the soaked tapioca 
in it about half an hour. Beat the eggs, mix all to- 
gether ani bake only till the puddings are just set 
in the middle, lest the custard in it curdle and sep- 
arate instead of being creamy rich. Any hot, clear, 
transparent sauce or lemon syiup suits, also brandy 
and wine sauces. This pudding is often serred cold 
with sweetened cream. Also may be cut cold in 
shapes, egged, breaded, and fried as fritters. 

Does it seem like extraTsgance to call for so many 
yolks of eggs for paddings ? Is is not. What 
might be so regarded in private house work is really 
the greatest economy in hotels where each ftesh 
meal is required to be as good as the one that pre- 
ceded it, and the whites of eggs left OTcr are needed 
in a hundred ways. The whites do no more good in 
puddings than so much flour or starch. The yolks 
give the richness and fine color. Probably at an- 
other time we shall haye a talk about silver cakes, 
snow cakes and a dozen others made with white of 
eggs, white cocoanut pies, white whips and floats, 
and the meringues must not be forgot.

«Now, Jerry, the bill of fkre— what pudding to- 
day?" 

**I thought I would give yon steamed pound if that 
will suit.'* 

•<wm suit first-rate if you don't fkil with it." 

<'Fail ?~f^ ?— there's no such word as fkil !" 
* « * 

<*Well, Jerry, it is time to dish up the puddings. 
How are they ? Look at them." 

"Failed fkiled— by the hoiypoker I" 

"Now, Jerry, this is too much for human nature. 
There is no need tofkil with steamed cake-puddings. 
There is a reason for everything, and pound pud- 
ding ftdls only because either there is too much 
sugar in the mixture or else because it does not get 
done enough. Now your mixture is all tight but 
your puddings are not done. There is a white, 
light layer on top where the steam was hottest, but 
all the rest is gum and sugar. Steamed sponge 
puddings are the easiest to cook; they take firom an 
hour and a quarter upwards according to sise. 
Pound puddings come next, but they must have near 
two hours, unless very small. Steamed fruit pud- 
dings take much longer. If you go to a high point 
in the mountains your puddings need to steam 
longer still. And remember the water below must 
never stop boiling, and time countc nothing if you 
have no steam up." 



Now who would have thought there was another 
pudding of bread, more or less, lurking back here t 
{^rry they are so numerous, but this is a very good 
one and steamed puddings are in demand.

1 quart of milk. 

4 whole eggs and 

8 jolks. 

1 teaspoonAil of baking powder. 

Lemon rind or extract. 

Mix the bread crumbs and sugar together. Put 
the butter in the milk and boil them. Pour the 
boiling miln and butter o?er the bread and let stand 
awhile to ste^p. Beat the eggs and jolks together 
and mix them in; the fla?oring, baking powder, then 
beat all together 2 or 3 minutes. Steam an hour or 
little longer in two buttered mou'ds. Serre with 
hard sauce, meringue sauce, butter sauce or maple 
sjrup. Better write it a finer name on the bill-of- 
&re. 



88S« Steamed SponflrePuddlxiff. 
WINE OR BRANDY SAUCE. 



14 ounces of granulated sugar. 

12 eggs. 

14 ounces of finest flour. 

Vanilla flavor, about two teaspoonAils. 

Beat the sugar and eggs together in a kettle half 
an hour by the c{pck. You can't time it by the arm 
ache, as ten minutes seems half an hour that way. 
Have the ingredients all cold and beat in a cool 
place. When the time is up the kettle will be half 
ftill of a foamy batter. Then stir in the flour in 
portions. Do not beat but stir round till the fiour 
is pretty well mingled and out of sight. Add the 
yanilla extfaot. To be perfect all sponge cake ar- 
ticles must be cooked as soon as the batter is fin- 
ished. Steam it in pudding moulds, jelly moulds, 
melon moulds or any kind you like — no matter 
about lids — about an hour and a half. 



Whenever any of these cake mixture puddings 
seem to be heavy or sticky, provided the fiuilt is not 
in the steaming, they may be corrected next time 
by using a .trifle less sugar. At great aUitudes 
the sugar has to be considerably less, and newly ar- 
rived pastry cooks are often "thrown*' through not 
understanding or being willing to believe it.

beaten. Then mix in the baking powder, after that 
the flour, milk , brandy, raisins. Steam in moulds 
from 1 ) to 2 hours. The wine sauce served with 
this pudding should have a lemon cut up in it. 
Raspberry vinegar is an excellent sauce for puddings 
of the above description.

There is something almost apalling in (he vaulting 
ambition ofthese cooks when they set themselves to 
naming puddings. How blest, then, is our lot,

belieying that it is not a Spenserite at all, but a 
tawny Italian oream pretending to oome accredited 
from 

"The court of Mab and of the ftery king." 
Then there would be * ■Princess Louise's pudding," 
"Beatrice pudding,*' and Marie Stuart's and Sir

As it is. we already haye the queen rose of I he rose

British roost, laurel crowned, with all his fierce snap- 
dragon flames around him; the sooialisi Jack Cade of 
puddings is coming on his way, and how do we know

haye been then. Meantime make way for the great; 
here comes imperial pudding. It is still a question 
whether this should be regarded as a 1' imperial or 
a r imperiale, but as padding is masculine in 
French probably it is imperial. No doubt but in 
this case the empress hud it made to suit the empe- 
ror, and not to suit herself, which makes it all the 
more remarkable.

Pineapple Puddinfirs Souffles. 



2 pounds of pineapple. 

1 pound of sugar. 

2 ounces of best butter. 

i pint, scant, of the pineapple juice. 

2 ounces of com starch. 
16 eggs. 

Qrate the pineapple if fresh, if canned mash fine 
as rossible adding the sugar at last to assist in re- 
ducing it to pulp. Then stir the pulp with the 
sugar and butter in it over the fire. Mix the starch 
with the juice and add to the fruit, and let it thick- 
en, after which add 8 y.)lks ot eggs, beat them in 
and let all cook 6 to 10 -minutes longer, and then 
set the mixture away to cool. 

Then beat the remaining 8 yolks in a bowl with a 
Dover egg beater. Whip the 16 whites to a firm 
fh)th that will not fall out of the bowl upside down, 
and stir in first the yolks and then the whites, 
lightly and without beating the mixture at all. 
Bake as soon as made in about 40 custard cups, 
buttered, or in sil? er scallops or shells, or else in 
paper cases. Ten minutes in a moderate oven is 
the time r<>quired to bike. Dredge powdered 
sugar on top before removing quite from the oven. 



The preceding receipt will answer as well for sev 
a-xl other varieties as if a column or t wo of repet ii ions 



wore written. Pears, quinces, apples, boaanM, par- 
haps other dry fruits may be used as well as pine- 
apple. The starch is to counteract the juiciness; 
with certain mealy kinds of apples it would not be 
needed. Bread or cracker crumbs have the same 
effect 8 yolks are cooked in the mixure and S 
well beaten are added raw. The whites must be 
beaten quite firm, and a wire whisk is the best to use 
for that purpose. The mixture when finished is as 
light and foamy as sponge cak e batter It rises and 
bakes cream color in the cups or cases Paper cases 
should be buttered inside and half baked befoie be- 
ing filled, and should be filled to the top to lo k 
well when done. Catefully wipe the outsides of 
cups before baking. These little fhiit puff pud- 
dings may be liked better with the addition of plain, 
thick cream for sauce. Sume people would add nut. 
meg or cinnamon or brandy to the composition of 
apple puffis. Any of these mixtures left over will do 
to fill tarts in patty pans. These are no better thaa 
other puddings. 1 hey are aH good.

THB AKBBIGAN PASTBY COOK. 



In oM tiineB» a rery Ionic while ago, there Uved a 
race of hotel cooks who ran in such a very little 
narrow rut, and had such verj small resources in 
their trade that whea they had made about three 
different puddings they were at their wit's end, and 
used to haye to butt their heads against the wall to 
shake up their memories, so they would know what 
on earth to make next. Then they would recollect 
something to make which required almonds, raisins 
and citron; but when they ran to the hotel store- 
room they found none of those articles in stock. 
Then ttaey had to butt their heads against the wall 
again harder, till they could think of something else, 
and that would require apples. But the store room 
would be bare of apples also. And then they had 
to go and find a harder place in the wall and butt 
their heads against it harder and longer every time. 
That was in the dark ages. What charity it wou^d 
have been, and what sufiering it would haye pre- 
yented if some person had stood up and told them 
what they might do in the case of a short store- 
room. How if they liad no bread they could use 
cake; if they had no yolks of eggs they could make 
a pudding of the whites; if they had no eggs at all 
nor milk they could do just as well with a pudding 
that would be ruined if even milk or eggs came 
near it; and if they had no pineapples they could do 
Tery well indeed with pumpkins. 

Pumpkin pudding must be older than pumpkin 
pie, because pumpkin pie is pumpkin pudding oyer 
the water. The first appearance of pumpkin in his- 
tory is in the story of a young person named Gin 
derella. who, finding her fine coach was cbaoged 
again into nothing but a hateAiI pumpkin that came 
rolling up to the door, felt yexed, and thought she 
would make a pudding of it. 

New Bncrlancl Pumpkin Pudding. 

8 pounds of dry stewed pumpkin. 

i pound of sugar or maple syrup. 

6 ounces of butter. 

1 pint of cream. 
10 eggs. 

J a nutmeg grated. 

\ teaspoonful of grated cinnamon. 

Steam the pumpkin and mash the reqtdred amount 
through a colander, as dry as possible. It is gener- 
ally well worth while to stew down the pumpkin 
with the sugar and butter in — which preyents burn- 
ing — till it has become thick and transparent. Then 
add the cream and eggs well beaten together, and the 
spices. Bake in two buttered pudding pans about 
half an hour. Is best when just done, but good 
either hot or oold. Brandy, rum or wine are some- 
times mixed in; but not necessary. 

Squash pudding can be made by the foregoing re- 
oeipt. Once and again I made the following for a 



crowd of passengers aground on a steamboat cp thr 
Arkansas, and they were g^ad I conld.

puree through a colander. Mix in the butter whi e 
still warm, then the sugar, liquor and yanilla. Sep- 
arate the eggs, beat the yolks into the mixture, and

2 heaping quarts of cracked wheat mush.

6 ounces of butter or chopped suet 

6 eggs. 

1} pints of milk. 

1 teaspoonful ot ground cinnamon. 

} pound of raisins. 

Mix and beat all the ingredients together, except 
raisins, the beaten eggs to be added last Strew the 
raisins on top in the pans; they sink if stirred in. 
Bake an hour. Maple syrup with butter for sauce. 



One large pint of cracked wheat raw will mace 
the aboye amount. The mush is expected to be dry, 
else use less milk or more eggs. The pudding has 
to be apparently quite fluid when put in the oven 
but comes out firm enough. When either of the pre 
ceding puddings are to be made, extra wheat should 
be put on for the brealifiELst mush, to secure the 
benefit of the three hours cooking. When the mush 
happens to be cold, mash it with the milk made hot, 
so as to have no lumps. Those are fayorite pud- 
dings and worth attention. 

Speaking of those titled personages brings to mind 
the Marchioness. Dickens* Marchioness and Dick 
Swiyeller. We haye particular business with Dick 
Swiyeller, for he must haye been the author and 
originator of the word duff, as applied to pudding. 
Else whence comes duff ? It is a word seyerely let 
alone by many people under the impression that it 
is blang; but slang is eyanescent, this word is stable 
and permanent. It cannot be eyen a yulgarism, for 
it permeates all through H. B. M's. most respect 
able army and nayy as well as the U. S's. Mid- 
shipman Easy undoubtedly used the word duff for 
pudding, and the entire orew of H M. S. Pinafore 
follow the same practice. It is simply a cockney 
ism, and cockneyisma extend all oyer the world. 8o 



the Greenwich pensioners and the Chelsea pension- 
ers; the Woolwich dock yard hands; the sailors on 
the high seas; the blue-coat children of charity 
marching down the streets and thoroughfkres which 
Dickens has made familiar, all haye their duff days 
— suet duff, currant duff, plain duff, plum duff 
Great days are the days marked by plum duff ! But 
they are not all. Thousands of factory operatiyea, 
thousands of railroad constructors of British, Cana 
dian, Australian and American railways all own a 
loying allegiance to King Duff I Now who will pre 
sume to laugh at Duff, with such a following, a new 
Jack Cade though he may be ? We shall do fikr bet- 
ter to discuss his merits, as the following pages are 
intended, not only Daff proper but his family and 
followers. But being but a new-comer, compara. 
tiyely, taking the place of old pudding, whence 
came the word. Did not some smallwit, such as we 
see in Thackeray's barrooms in the Newcomes, pre- 
tending the pudding was not cooked enough, call 
for more dough ? And did not another smallwit 
say if e n-o-u g-h spelt enuff, d-o-u-g«h spelt duff ? 
and they had had enuff duff. But this would neynr 
haye gone abroad if Dick SwiyeUer had not been 
there. He was a little stage struck and yery popu- 
lar at his boarding house. He had taken the Maiw 
chioness to the theatre iht night before, and on that 
day they took a sumptuous dinner at a London cheap 
boarding house. So when it came to calling for the 
pudding he remembered the smallwits and shouted 
to the waiter 

*'Laf on, Mack— Duff, and dumb be he that first 
cries, hold, enough I*' 

Poor Dick ! he is gone now. But duff is all oyer 
the world. In the copper mines of Lake Superior, 
and in the carbonate mines of the Rocky Mountains, 
they call for duff as glibly as on board the Alaska 
whalers; and in all those places all our fine pud 
dings would be called duff just the same 

InflBuitine pudd*n; feminine pudding; masculine 
duff. 

But 

**Quantum suf 
Ficit of duff," 

Yet here he comes. Shake him heartily. He is 
no popinjay **perfumed life a milliner," with flum- 
meries, frills and furbelows. He is an athlete in 
athletic garb; not now in fighting trim, but mellow 
with doing good; his countenance shining and hie 
sides shaking with fatness. Is he rough and plain? 
But think how he goes into the conyalesoent wards; 
the workhouses; the almshouses, the yeteran re- 
treats, the charity schools, the penitentiaries, the 
yery hulks, and they all smile to see him come. 
And what might not happen in bsrraoks army and 
nayy training schools, in camp and on the sea, were 
the regular weekly yisitsof this potentate arbitrarily 
forbidden ? Athlete, did we say t Why^ blest iia»

4Me. Plain Boiled Suet Padding. 

:i pounds of flour. 

1 pound of suet. 

1 J pints of water. 

A large teaspoonfUl of salt. 

Chop the suet, not too fine, and rub it into the flour. 
Mix with the water. It makes a soft dough. Beat 
it thoroughly wi'h a spoon. Put it in a conioal or fun- 
nel-shaped pudding bag, pre?ioualy wetted and 
floured, and boil about three hours. The water 
should be boiliog when the pudding is put in and 
not allowed to stop. The suet makes the pudding 
quite light and rich. Eat with butter and syrup.

Ourraat Suet Roll, 



1} pounds of flour. 

1 pound of chopped suet. 

1 pound of currants or raisiiis. 

1 pint of water. 
Salt. 

Mix altogether. Make the dough into two long 
riills, solid, tie op in cloths and boil two hours. The 
softer the dough can be to be, handled at all, the 
lighter the pudding will be. 

404« Bnfflish Suet Puddinff . 

2 pounds of flour.

1 pound of white sugar. 

1 pound of either raisins or currants. 

1 teaspoonftil of salt. 

Mix the aboTC together dry, then add 

1 pint of milk. 

2 eggs. 

A small teaspoonfUl of soda. 

Stir all thoroughly together. Boil in pudding 
bags 4 hours. 

More eggs in this pudding injures it. Can be 
made without any. Butter and sugar, cream sauce, 
or syrup, or ai^ kind of pudding sauce suits. 

405« Boiled Oinnamdn Pudding. 



A considerable Tariation of the preceding pudding 
is made by addinic to it 1 heaping teaspoonful of 
ground cinnamon — makes it of a pinkish color. 
Ground ginger may be used in the same way. Gi?e 
all these puddings room to swell and become light 
when tying the pudding bag.

cutting in thinnest slices and squares across. Mix 
all the dry articles together except sod k and salt, 
which dissolye in the milk. Grate the lemon rinds in. 
Mix up wiih the milk and eggs. Squeexe in the 
lemon juice at last. Tie up in 2 pudding c'oths, 
wetted and floured, and boil 8 hours. Hard sauce 
cream sauce, golden sauce or wine. 



The missing link in this eyolution of puddings

back to the place of beginning at plum pudding

Now if it were right and proper or eyen allowable 
to base an hypothesis upon pudding, we should say 
that the great mistake of Bulwer's life was in wish- 
ing that his countrymen were Frenchmen and in 
keeping them constantly reminded of his wish; and 
the great mistake of Dickens' life was in soeering at 
Americans for not being English. Dickens was for- 
giyen because of his world-wide Anglo-Saxonism;

Bclwer retains his hold onlj by sheer strength; 
through the polish and exaoi fit of his work, not 
through loTO or indulgence Diokens was English 
even to the ohops and tomato sauoe of Piokwick and 
all the little bread and oheese and kisses repasts of his 
people. Bulwer sneered at the national Yorkshire 
pudding, and blackberry pudding, and boiled yeal, 
and he is not popular. Hotel keepers are mindftil 
of the dread warning. When all nations and peo- 
ples shall hare come to think alike and eat alike, 
then the dreams of the uniyersal peace society will 
be realized and there will be an uniTersal language. 
In the meantime English inn keepers go on proyid- 
ing roast beef with Torkshire pudding; pease pud- 
ding; boiled apple dumplings and tea and toast; and 
American hotel keepers doing business for profit 
keep up the supply of ham and eggs, oyster soup, 
turkey with cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie and 
mince pie, and coffee and Parker House rolls All 
easy enough, and no need of stroking the ftir the 
wrong way. 

408. Yorkshire Padding. 



1 pound of flour. 
8 pints of milk. 

2 ounces of butter, melted. 
6 eggs. Bait. 

i teaspoonftil of baling powder. 

Haye the milk not too cold, else it sets the butter. 
Mix the flour with it by degrees, free from lumps. 
Add butter, salt, powder, the eggs well beaten and 
beat up all thoroughly. Butter a baking pan and 
make it warm in the oyen. Pour in the batter less 
than an inch in depth. Bake 15 minutes, or till 
lightly browned. When the pudding is made with 
water instead of milk add a spoonful of golden syrup 
to cause it to brown quickly. If made without the 
butter it will puff up at the sides, but soon foils and 
becomes tough. 



On the twentieth day of August, eighteen hun- 
dred and fifty.nine, in the heigh th of the Pike's 
Peak gold excitement in this country, Yorkshire 
pudding was served for diiner in the palace of 
Prince Frederick William of Prussia. It is best to 
be chronologically particular in noting these histo 
rical eyents, and this we know was a fact, for we 
.haye the printed menu with the royal crown and 
the date upon it, just as we haye another, showing 
that on the 6th day of July, 1868, His serene High- 
ness, the SuUan of Turkey, entertained Prince Je 
rome Bonaparte, where was seryed : 

Truffle omelet; p<ns9oni /nto; (doesn't say what 
kind of fried fish, but doubtless from the Bospborus.j 
courgtt farcin; (stuffed Jonah's gourds); beurek^ 
(wasn't that nice?) bifteeksauz pommet; (the potatoss 
a la' parisienne, of course); harieott verU; 



(those ubiqutous snap beans I) fHepkl*-\ (don't you 
wish you had some ?) gtUe au maroMquin; vimaii; 
ekmek. That caps the climax I Though it is not all 
the bill-of fare, only about two thirds 

Howeyer, we were trying to say that while we 
know by the documents that Yorkshire pudding was 
seryed at the palace as stated, the other matter 
which we know quite as well, yet cannot demon- 
strate, is that the cooks there separated the eggs and 
made the pudding magiifioent by beating the whites 
to a firm fVoth and stirring them in immediately 
before baking. This is the way the line reads : 

"Roast beef a I'AngUise^ York-Pudding " And 
it is preeeryed in the **em9ine eUurique." 



But it is not the Yorkshire pudding they long for 
so much. On these cruel cold dajs, when eyen the 
wild animals hedge up close to the cosy settlementt 
and the birds find wondrous attractions about the 
kitchen door steps, you may see poor, hungry chil- 
dren flattening their noses against cook shop and 
restaurant windows, gasing, when the inside steam 
allows, upon the luscious puddings, and fain would 
fill their bellies with the crusts that stick to the 
sides of the pans and no man gives unto them. They 
are huddle! in remnants of old shawls and cast off 
coats, twice too big, and dragging on the ground, 
their toee haye a too close acquaintance with the 
snow and mire, and all doors are shut. It is not 
the Yorkshire pudding that they wish so much, a'l 
swimming in rich grayy thongh it be, because that 
is connected with the thought of a piece of brown, 
fat roast beef, and their thoughts dare not mono t so 
high; but the pudding beside it, the batter pudding 
with fat in the hollows and raisins snuggling close 
together by twos and threes in the rich dimples. 
Just this square or that, and no man gives unto 
them.

when baked in a small pudding dish and set on the

it to about boiling heit; mind it don't bum at bot

curd up in the towel to drip dry — about 12 hours

LifB is ftiU of such compensations as these. 
Forbidden to use bread any more in our puddings 
we must manage to get along with cake. But wait, 
befure commencing on the laborious sayoy cake 
puddings there is something else. 

What a world of Aunt Betsey Trotwoods there 
used to be eating arrowroot pcdding fur the sake of 
poor blacks that neyer existed, with a solicitude 
like hers for Copperfield's imaginary sister I It is 
plain it was an adyertising scheme. The argument 
was : there are thora poor blacks in the West In- 
dies; you haye caused them to be freed from bond- 
age; there is nothing they can do for a Hying but 
make arrowroot; if they cannot sell their arrowroot 
they will die, therefore, to saye their liyes, you 
must eat arrowroot pudding. Then arrowroot found 
a good maiket and the great maiority of all the gold 
spectacled people in the ciyilized world were eating 
all they oouM. The gold spectacle distinction has 
to be made because people below that rank could 
not yery well afford it. as the poor people who made 
arrowroot would haye died if they had not sold it 
at a high price. Eating arrowroot pudding is not 
such a yery unpleasant way of being beneyolent, 
but, bless thdr kind hearts, there came a time when 
the gold spectacles could not possibly eat any more, 
aod barrels of arrowroot lined with blue paper be- 
came uncomfortably numerous in the merchants* 
warehouses. Then they began mixing it wiih rioe 
flour and starch and reducing the price, and there 
neyer being a yery striking difference bet ween starch 
and arrowroot the cheap article has at last yery 
nearly banished arrowroot altogether, except from. 
the drug stores. All the aonexed receipts fioor 
starch puddings will do equally well for arrow- 
root, in case there are any people solicitous for the 
welfare of arrowroot manufacturers still left in this 
world

2 ounces of butter. 

2 or 8 yolks of eggs 

} teaspoonftil of salt. 

Vanilla or almond flayoring. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it Mix the 
staroh with a little milk oold; thin it with some hot 
milk out of the kettle; pour it quioklj into the boil- 
ing milk and stir two minutes, or till it is well 
thickened. Hare ready the two yolks beaten with 
a spoonftil of milk, take off the kettle, beat the 
yolks in, the heat of the starch will cook them, then 
the butter and flayorings. Turn the pudding out of 
the kettle it wtt made in to a bright pan butteted 
slightly, and kelp warm till wanted. Serye with 
lemon syrup sauce or with iiot cream. 

There are not many puddings as cheap and simple 
as that. Nothing else is so quick, and it is neyer 
sUghied at table. **But why was it, the pudding so 
nice and rich and firm when first made afterwards 
turned to liquid in the pan and could not be dished 
up?" 

It was kept too hot and cooked too much. 



490. Boiled Farina Pudding. 

2 quarts of milk. 
} pound of sugar. 
7 ounoes of fkrina. 
4 ounoes of butter. 

3 yolks of eggs. 
Salt and flayoring. 

Nearly the same as oom staroh pudding. Boil 
the milk and sugar and sprinkle in the farina dry, 
beating like making mush. Let cook slowly half an 
hour with the lid on, at the back of the range. Then 
Add eggs and butter. Lemon, wine, yanilla, cus- 
tard, or cream sauce. 



'*Such puddings as the two last come in Just 
right for second puddings." 

•'What do you mean by second paddings ? — they 
are just right for first." 

''But to offset the rich pudding, just as rich as it 
can be, the other hu to be plain and of a lighter 
kind, such as your apple custards and fruit souffles 
and plain rice puddings to suit people of simpler 
Caates" 

"Not now. The fkshion of haying two hot pud. 
dings at once is abandoned in all the best hotels. 
Inste^id of matching your puddings, one lich and 
one plain, or one baked and oi.e steamed, you now 



match your one hot pudding with your oold creams 
and custards and floats and the pastries, and some 
of these are rich enough to require the pudding to 
be as simple as the oom staroh, if all are to be 
pleased. And don't haye a brandy sauce pudding 
at the same time with a cold tipsy oustard — giye the 
people who abhor liquor a chance."

2 quarts of milk, scant. 

i pound, good weight, of com starch. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

i teaspoonful of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of yanilla extract. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it — whioh preyents 
burning at bottom. Mix up the staroh with a little 
cold milk and then some hot, pour it quickly into 
the boiling milk in the kettle and almost immedi 
ately, or as soon as fkiriy mixed take it off the fiie. 
Beat in the butter immediately to cool it; then the 
yolks beaten up with a spoonful of milk; flayor and 
bake about 20 minutes or till the eggs are fairly 
set The art to be learned in all sorts of corn starch 
puddings is to cook the staroh enough so that the 
rawness cannot be tasted, yet not enough to cause 
it to turn watery. Serye with Sultana sauce.

Anyone who has made the nonpareil or queen 
pudding will understand this in a moment when told 
it is the same thing done in c^rn starch. Make the 
pudding of com starch as in the foregoing leceipt 
When barely set in the middle spread oyer the top — 
or drop portions with a spoon — of pi ach marmalade 
or preseryes. Make that hot on top and spread me- 
ringae of 8 whites whipped firm and 6 ounces of 
sugar oyer it. Bake again about 6 minutes with the 
oyen door open. Cream sauce. 

The writer has seen more partial failiires, prob- 
ably, with this class of puddings than with any 
others, and asks to be excused for dwelling upon 
trifling details for that reason. They are excellent 
when excellently made. The marmalade on top 
must be made cooking hot before the meringue 
touches it if you would ayoid haying an undesirable 
albuminous syrup oyerflowing the pudding, and the 
meringue must be only dry-baked. 



There are people who like chocolate in any form

i a nutmeg grated. 

Wash the barley in several waters to free it fh>m

back of the range about 8 hours, with a tight lid on. 
Mix the other ingredients in and bake about half 
an hour Currants and raisins can be added if de- 
sired. Two full quarts of barley ready cooked, if 
dry, answers the same. 



The reason for inserting the preceeding good pud- 
ding there in haste was the ever present fear of 
stepping into an American pie if we did not shut: off 
corn storch immediately. 



Strange, but true, almost every pudding we touch 
and begin to polish up whisks us up and carries us 
over the water as quick as the genii did those who 
rubbed Aladdin's lamp. That puddings do not 
often beluDg here is due to the fact that while Uncle 
Sam's childreu love not pudding less they love pie 
more, and are very apt to call all things of .native 
origination pie that would elsewhere be called pud- 
ding. Ihis has been more than once before observed 
in these columns, and here is an example. There 
were the soldiers Jin the late great war, many of 
them fh)m homes of plenty and luxury, little relish, 
iiig the rough fare of the anoiy commissariat, and 
some genius among them struck a culinary idea and 
invented '^Lincoln pie.'* Wherefore Pie? It was 
a hard tack pudding in reality, but was made pie in 
obeiieuce to a national instinct, and as Lincoln pie 



it had for a time an immense run of popularity Ikr 
outoide of the army, being sold in mil the bakeries 
The original was composed of hard-tack, bacon fat, 
mo1a«se8 and dried apples, with a tough flour enist, 
but fat times and fitt camps were ocoanonally en- 
countered and then Lincoln pie blossomed out to 
this.

paste. Pour in the mixture to be 1} inohee deep. 
Cover with another very thin sheet of paste. Brush 
over with milk. . Bake to a light color in a slow 
oven about three quarters of an hour. Out out 
squares either hot or cold.

Plain Short '^'aste. 



2 pounds of flour. 

i pound of good lard, butter, dripping8,or gnt«d 
suet. 

1 teaspoonfbl of salt. 

1 pint of water. 

A handful of flour more to roll out with. 

Rub the lard into the flour dry, till thoroughly 
mixed. Put in the salt and all the water, work it 
up to a smooth paste, roll it out once like pie paste, 
fold it over and it is ready for use. 

The water should always be poured into a hollow 
in the flour when making any kind of paste, and 
the flour drawn in rapidly but gradually while 8ti> 
ring with the fingers, otherwise the paste may be 
rough and lumpy and much working to correct the 
mistake will make it hard. 



427. Boiled Apple Dumplings. 

Make the plain short paste preceding. Pare and 
core good cooking apples; cut them in halves. Roll 
the paste to a sheet a quarter of an inch thick, put 
the apple under the edge, gather paste around snd 
pinch it off underneath, and so on, till all the sheet 
is used up. See that there are no holes or thin places 
to let in the water. Drop the dumplings into broad 
saucepans of boiling water, shut down the lids; let 
them cook about half an hour, or till the apples 
leave the fork when tried. Short paste cannot be

made any richer for these without breaking in the [ oth^r 
wvter. 



428. Dumplixiffs Cooked in Sauce. 

Make the dampUngs like the last rarietj, but use 
the roll-pudding paste made with baking-j^wder as 
directed in the earlj part of this book, adding an 
egg to the mixing water for farther precaution 
against breaking in, boiling. Then boll the dump- 
lings in their own sauce in the oyen. Thi9 is effected 
by half -filling two bright and clean baking pans 
with milk and water. When boiling drop in the 
dumplings and cook about half an hour with but- 
tered paper oyer the top to prevent browning, and 
baste occasionally with the liquor, which will glaxe 
tLem. Then put } pound of sugar and \ of butter 
in each pan, and strain the sauce thus made after 
the dumplings have been remoTed to another pan. 
Peach dumplings are better this way than any 

other. 

420. * Raspberry Puddinff. 



The directions for making this will answer foi 
every kind of fhiit that can be used for puddings 

Make the plain short paste as previously directed 
— ^if with suet it should be chopped with flour mixed 
in till it is as fine as powder. Line some deep earth 
enware bowls of any siie from a pint to two quarts 
with the paste rolled out to a thin sheet. Then fill 
quite full and rounded up with fVesh-picked rasp- 
berries. Wet the edges of the paste; roll out a 
round sheet of paste and lay it on top; cut off the 
surplus by rolling the edge with the rolling-pin, 
thereby closing it at same time. Wet and flour a 
pudding cloth, lay the middle on top of the pudding, 
gather the comers around the bottom of the bowl 
and tie safely. Drop the pudding upside down into 
plenty of boiling water and keep boiling from one 
to two hours, according to size and kind. When 
done dip the pudding a moment in cold water, take 
off the cloth] out a round hole in the top, put in a 
sufficiency of sugar and serve in the bowl set on a 
plate. No sauce needed. Several pleasant com- 
binations of sweet and sour kinds of fruit oan be 
made and used in this way; sometimes with a suit- 
able sauce. 



crust on them, then the remainder rf the 
cherries and a third sheet of dough on top. Set in 
a steamer and steam from 80 to 45 minutes and 
serve while hot and light, with sauce. 



All kinds of fruits can be used to make the above 
kind of steamed pudding, which has no shortening, 
but plenty of powder, and has the firuit in layers 
like apple roll. 

480 a. Fine Hominy Padding. 

2 large cupfuls of cooked fine hominy — hominy 
grits or s«mp. 

Butter sixe of an egg^l} ounces. 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar — 2 ounces. 

2 yolks or 1 egg. 

1 small cupful of milk. 

The hominy grits already cooked, should be dry 
and firm, otherwise use less milk or none. Mix all 
the ingredients together, the butter softened first, 
and bake in a buttered pudding pan about Cfteen 
minutes. It takes a quart pan to bake it in. Use 
yolks of eggs if a rich pudding is wanted. Serve 
with a sauce. If no hominy ready put on a large 
half cupful in full cup of water, and when it has 
boiled nearly dry add a small cup of milk and pinch 
of salt; never sti* it, but let cook with a lid on one 
half hour longer, at the back of the range. 



Boiled White Ck>m Meal Puddin^r- 



480. Stecuned Cherry Podding. 

1 quart of pitted cherries. 
8 heaping cups of flour. 

I teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

2 cupfuls of water. 

Mix the powder in the flour dry, make a hollow 
in the middle, throw in a little salt, pour in the 
water and mix up as soft as it can be handled. 
Work the dough on the table slightly by pressing it 
flat with the hands and doubling over. Lay a bot- 
ton crust of it in a tin pudding pan thnt holds 4 
quarts; spread half the pitted cherries on it, lay an- 



1 pound of white com meal (scant quart). 

1 quart milk. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

6 ounces of chopped suet. 

A little salt. 

3 eggs. 

1 lemon, juice and grated rind. 

2 teaspoonfuls of extract ginger. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it ; sprinkle intha 
meal and stir it over the fire five minutes. 

Then take it off, mix in the suet, salt, eggs beaten 
and ginger. Wet and flour a pudding bag ; place it 
in a bowl; pour in the pudding ; tie loose enough 
for it to swell to nearly double its bulk ; drop in 
plenty of boiling water and keep it boiling 6 hours. 
When to be taken up, dip it a moment in cold water 
and it will come out of the cloth smooth. Serve with 
butter and sugar hard sauce. 



430 c. Qranula Padding*. 

Qranula is claimed to be a healthfU dietetic of 
the same order as graham flour.* It is apparently 
parched wheat ground like corn meal, coarsely. It 
makes a pudding resembling Indian meal padding. 
Make it precisely as directed for farina, either 
boiled or baked. See Nos. 877 and 420. Use 4 
cups of milk or water to 1 cup of granula.

THS AMEBICAN FASTBY COOX. 



Had it not seemed perfeotly UBelesd to ask so 
simple a creature as that I should eertainlj have 
tried to learn some more various uses of the magnifi- 
cent chestnuts which we picked up in passing 
through the grand old manor grounds, but the fear 
of having her shortly answer, "Wbj roast them in 
the bard aod eat them " deterred me. If there were 
no larger and better chestnuts than these sold so 
pleniifu )y and cheaply on the streets there would 
not be much inducement even for the famous mon- 
key and catspaw business being fo'lowed, of placing 
chestnuts between the bars of open fire places till 
they burst and fly out^.but the Spanish and British 
chestnuts are of a larger growth. Good old Horace 
Greeley, or at least the paper under his direction, at 
one time became very earnest in recommending the 
extensive planting of chestnut trees in the west. It 
concerns us here only to hope that the result may be 
after a while plenty of chestnuts of the large variety, 
wherewith to compound the European chestnut 
puddings. _^.» 

For hotel cooks who have little time to peel and 
scrape the small chestnuts in quantities, the follow- 
ing two pudding receipts will probably be found 
sufficient, at least till we come to frozen pud- 
dings among the ices. 

There is a meal-co'ored, dumpy little elf, down 
stairs, chuckling audibly and saying there is a good 
deal more in dumplings than a little Short Paste 
knows, fiie language is that of Marguerite, but 
the accent is either that of Hans or Gretchen. The 
German elves are generally meal-colored. Queer old 
German stories there are of some of them going in a 
rolic to some tyrannio«l .baron s granaries in the 
myterious small hours^of night, grinding a 1 the 
wheat in a few minutes in the baron s own mill and 
carrying the bags of meal with many a Is ugh to all 
the widows' and orphans' homes without so much 
as marking them G. D. The noisiest of those 
below is only '*Davy Dompling, boiling in the pot,*' 
but it appears from the talk that dumpling is a 
Ctorman word, and is not much different in Swedish, 
Norwegian and Danish. 

There must be something in dumpling worth going 
to Rhineland to see about, but this chestnut pud- 
ding has to be made and steamed and baked first 

The English and French receipts always prescribe 
certain numbers of chestnuts, as two or three dozen. 
It takes from 150 to 200 of the plentiful American 
chestnuts to weigh a pound, hence the uselessnes of 

such receip's. 

431. Steamed Chestnut Padding. 

1 pound of chestnut pulp. 

} pint of cream. 

i pound of fresh butter. 



\ pound of sugar. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

6 whites of eggs. 

Pinch of salt. 

Vanilla or almond flavoring. 

Boil 1^ pounds of chestnuts in water one hour. 
Peel them, scrape off the furry outside; and mash the 
kernels through a seive, moistening with hot cream. 
Mix all the other ingredients with this puree except 
the whites of e^gs; the yolks haying been weU 
beaten before stirring in. 

Whip the whites firm, and lightly mix them in 
withoct beating. Steam in buttered moulds about 
one hour. Serve as soon as done, with diluted 
fruit jelly made hot for sauce, or e'se with French 
wine custard. 

48S. Chestnut Puddinsr SoufEle. 

Make the preceding pudding with only six of the 
yoUsand no whites. Stir it over the fire till it 
thickens. Take it off and add four raw ^olks and 
when nearly cold all the whites beaten firm, and 
( pint of brandy. Bake in a two-quurt mould 
about half an hour. Dredge vanilla flavored sugar 
over the top in the oven, and send it straight from 
oven to table. Powdered vanilla bean will flavor 
the sugar. 



Very often in the dinner bills of European plan 
hotels there appears in pudding's place *'Savarin 
Cake." Persons unaware of all our singular ways 
would be apt to think there was no pudding. In 
hotels where the cake is set on the table in baskets 
Savarin cake as pudding is pretty sure to get ost in 
the confusion. In United Stales parlance Savarin 
ca^e is Savarin pudding as follows: 



Savarin pudding is a hot cake, yeast raised but 
like sponge cake, with a liquor poured into it. and 
may be served with sweetened cream. My meal- 
colored eU downstairs, the muscular one who aits 
on the dough trough lid to keep the dough from 
raising it, says it takes German baiters and cooks to 
know how to make fine yeast-raised cakes, that 
American cooks and bakers are content to get along 
with pound and sponge cakes for every occasion. 

In a proposed book of breads yet to come we will 
have a course of yeast raised cakes beginning with 
the simplest and including Savarin. However, the 
common and satisfactory way is to use a good hot 
sponge or savoy cake for this pudding. Here 

are both ways. 

488« Savarin Cake. 



1 pound of good lively roll dough. 

1^ pounds of freshest buMer.

^ i pound of almonds. 
^ Lemon or nutmeg extract. 
\ This must be commenced five or six hours before 
)he meal. For a middaj dinner, take the roll dough, 
,^'or dough bought of a baker), at seyen in the morn- 



ing, put it in a pan with the sugar and butter and 
} set in a warm corner to get all warmed through. In 
^half an hour, beat tb em together, then begin adding 
'the eggs two at a time and the flour a handful at a 
time Beat like biitzen. It makes a soft batter 
like pound cake. Beat it some more agaiost the 
side of the pan. Set it in a moderately warm place 
for 'about two hours, when it shou'd be risen to 
about twice its original bulk, then best again for 
fire minutes; add the brandy and flaToring extract. 
B'anch and shred the almonds. Strew them eyeoly 
over the insides of two buttered cake moulds; put in 
the batter with a spoon; set to rise in the moulds 
again about 1} hours, then bake in a slow oven 
about 1 hour, or according to size and depth of 
cakes. When nicely baked these cakes are of a rich 
orange color and quite spongy. Set them on the 
dish upside down; push a small funnel down in 
seyeral places and by its means pour into the cake 
some hot orange syrup iaixed with ouraooa. Serv e 
warm. — 

434. Savarin Pudding. 

A large buquit de tavoie partly saturated with a 
fine Itguwr and served hot with cream. 

Prepare one or two cake moulds by brushiog over 
with the clear part of melted butter. When cold 
and set, or nearly so, sift in some powdered sugar 
to coat the moulds, and turn out the surplus. Then 
make the cake 

14 ounces of granulated sugar. 

12 eggs. 

12 ounces of flour — good weight. 

1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract. 

} pint of brandy. 

Have the ingredients all quite cold. Beat the 
sugar and eggs in a round bottomed kettle, wit-h a 
arge wire egg-whisk, half an hour by the clock. 
Then " cut in,'' or lightly stir in the flour with a 
spoon, then the extract and brandy. When all the 
flour is out of sight stop stirring and bake the cakes 
as soon as you can Sift gi^anulated sugar on top be- 
fore baking. Have a moderate oven and not the 
least dark color about the cakes. They bake easily 
in about half an hour. 

When done pour into them through holes made 
with a knife point or ftinnel about a pint of nice 
lemon or orange syrup with half as much curacoa 
or maraschino mixed in. Serve with either hot 
cream pweetened or a plain custard in the sau- 
cers. 

In about forty-nine out of every fifty places 
where these puddings are made they - have to be 
baked in ranges or sieves, and take their chance for 
their turn with meats, fishes, pies, potatoes, para- 



nips, etc., etc., so that special attentions and gradu- 
ated fires are out of the question. With the utmost 
respect for the fiftieth, the writer avows a greater 
desire to be of service to the forty- nine, and ^or an 
easier way recommends the annexed. 



435. Tipsy PuddinfiT With Oream. 

This is first cousin to the two preceding, and is 
popular, but is quite elastic in the way of detai s 
that is it can be made and sauced in different wajs 
not worth considering separate puddings, \iake

else a custard with maraschino or brandy Of you 
can partly saturate the sheets of cake, which shou'd 
be quite light colored, with spoonftils of brandy and 
have the ens ard plain. 



We have the next when we want to gild refined 
gold, for extra times, when all else seems stale, flat 
and unprofitable. 



is not very tedious to make and there is no difficulty 
except in getting enough of it. 

436. 

Baked Sponge Roll With Sauoe. 

Make the sponge cake mixture according to the 
directions under the head of Savarin pudding. 
Bather use less sugar than more. Too much sugar 
is one ftrequent cause of poor sponge cake. Qrease 
and flour some b king sheets or shallow roll pans 
Spread the batter over them as thin as can be, just 
to cover the iron. Bake in a brisk oven about five 
minutes, run a knife down the sides to loosen the 
cake. Turn it upside down on a clean table and 
shake the cake loose. 

Immediately spread red current jelly thinly a 1 
over and roll the cake up neatly. Serve warm, cut 
in suitable pieces, with a rich transparent 8«uce con- 
taining lemon juice and flavored poured over. 

It is too much trouble and wastes time to bake 
these sponge sheets on sheets of paper. Very little 
practice is needed to use the bare pan with greater 
advantage. Sometimes it helps a bad bake to roll 
up a briit'e sheet after the roll is made, in a sheet of 
paper to improve its shape. 



No one expected to find the above in a book of 
puddings, but Buskin says that cookery means the 
knowledge of all fruits and herbs and balms and

We ought not to forget thi^ white ooeoanut souffle. 
It is good to use up white of eggs, and good for 
other purposes. 



43T. Ck>ooanut Pudding Souffle. 

1 quart of milk. 

6 ounoes of sugar. 

8 ounces of oom starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

} pound of grated or desioated coooanut. 

12 whites of eggs, (10 or 12 ounces). 

Rose and lemon fla?of log. 

Set the milk on to boil. 

Mix the starch and sugar together dry; drop 
them at once into the boiling milk; stir up rapidly. 
As soon as it becomes thick beat in the butter then 
the coooanut, take it off tbe fire and let it oool, but 
not set firm. Then beat the whites to a firm fVoth 
Beat up the pudding mixture, stir in the whites add 
flavoring and bake about ten minutes in the usual 
manner, either in cups, shells, cases or in one round 
mould. Powdered sugar on top. 



This is a case of conscience. A I'ttle way back 
tipsy pudding was placed close after Sayarin pud- 
ding and called its first cousin, and now there is a 
fear that good old Brillat-SaTarin may be dis- 
honored by its being called his, as if it were all 
the same and as if be h«d been a tipsy 
man. Don't. Names are cheap; use some other. 
Bri>lat Savarin was well-di«po9ed towards cooks, as 
was also Lever, the elder Dumas and Thick eray, each 
after his own manner. You, reader, would make 
the tipsy pudding so excellently that the great ad- 
vocate of gastronomy would but smile indulgently, 
but suppose that down there where bad hotels exist 
some poor fellow following your example of license 
should make it inferentially sppear that Savarin was 
fond of sheets of cake saturated with horrible 
corn-juice whisky, and a turpentinish flavor of ran- 
cid lemon oil put up in a villsge drug store. Don't 
mix names; or if you must, take a slice of flne white 
bread and pour pure milk over it, and call that Sav- 
arin pudding. He would agree with us; bread and 
milk pure and simple is glorious in comparison. 

One of Savarin' s ideal dinners, a Barmacide feast 
which he spreads on paper, and which ii to "rive, 
every guest*s attention," at which «the faces of all; 
one after another, are seen to beam with an ecstasy 
of enjoyment, the perfect repose of bliss," fioisbes 
with a pyramid of vanilla and rose meringue caVe — 
a test sometimes useless, unless in the case of ladies, 
abbes, etc." 

What then, amongst the various article to which 
such a description might apply was this pyramid of 
vanilla and rose mer ngue-cake appearing at the 



end of dinner, if not something like these next 
described? 

A peculiarity about the meringae puddings next 
following (or call them merineue cakes as Savarin 
did, if you like), is that it takes a good p stry cook 
to make them successfully; but then they have the 
advantage of not being too common. They are not 
such as one would want to make every day; yet they 
are rich, elegant, ornamental and can be aerved 
either cold or hot, whole on the table or in individ- 
ual portions. They consist of three distinct p*rts; 
the cake bottom the cream layer in the middle and 
the ornamental meringue on top; yet the first speci- 
men being well made the half doxen others, all dif 
ferent, can be put through by the same methods, and 
the first trouble is not lost. 



438. Lemon Oream Meringue. 
Maffnolia Merinffue 



For the first part or bottom layer make this most 
useful cake mixture, called butter sponge cake. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 
10 eggs. 

i pound ot butter melted. 

} pint of milk, slight y warmed. ] 

H pounds of flour. 

2 teaspoonftils of baking powder. 
Vanilla or lemon flavor. 

Beat the sugar and eggs together about five nin- 
utes. Add the melted butter, the milk, the extract 
of vanilla, and beat all one minute more. Then beat 
in the baking powder, and into the light foamy batter 
thus made immediately stir the flour. 

This can be used for jelly cakes, cream cakes, 
and many other purposes. 

Butter and flour the bottoms of two bright pad- 
ding-pans^four quart milk pans are good — and 
spread the cake batter over thinly, like jelly cakes. 
Bake very light colored. Let the batter be well up 
to the edges so as to have the sheets level, not bulged 
up in the midd e. Then make the lemon oream. 

3 pints of water^Boant. 
} pound of sugar. 

4 lemons. 

8 ounces of com staroh. 

1 ounce of butter. 

10 yolks of eggs. 

Boil tbe water with the butter in it. Mix the 
starch, sugar and grated lemon rinds all together 
'iry, then stir rapid y into the boiling water. Take 
the mixture from tbe fire; add to it the juice of three 
of the lemons, (if large), and then tbe beaten yolks. 

Pour this mixture on top of the sheets of cake in 
the pans, without loosening them, and bake in a 
s'ow oven about 15 minutes on theshe^f of the oven, 
or with a ])an under to prevent the bottoms bak 
ing too much. 



THE AHEBICAN PASTBT COOK.

The preceding is almost lemon pie mixtare, bat 
k firm enough to cut square sided like oake. 

When the lemon cream is fairly set spread a thick 
layer of meringue on it while still hot and finish bak- 
ing with the oven door open; time about ten minutes. 
Senre out in tall but narrow diamonds or squares in 
plates or saucers with whipped cream around. Ten 
to fourteen whites and about as many ounces of 
sugar are required for the meringue. 

430. Almond Oream Meringue. 



Prinoess Merinffue. 



Make and bake the oake sheets in the pansj same 
as for the lemon cream meringue preceding, then 
make the a'mond as follows: 

8 pints of milk. 

4 ounces of sogar. 

8 ounoes of com staroh* 

} pound of almonds. 

1 ounce of butter. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Flavoring of rose. 

Pinch of salt. . 

Scald the almonds, peel, mince and then pound 
them to a rough paste. Boil the milk, mix the starch 
and sugar together dry, stir rap idly into the milk, 
take off, and add the other ingredients, the whites 
not beaten, except in the mixture, and the almonds 
and rose extract last. 

Bake this white oream on the cakes as before. 
Make the meringue a rose-pink color, flavor with 
vanilla and rose, and sift granulated sugar on top 
before baking. Serve with a port wine and lemon 



440. 



Ohooolate Oreazn Meringue. 
Gipey Merinffue. 

The same in the main as tt*e two preoeding with a 
chocolate oream for the middle. 

8 pints of milk. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of grated chocolate. 

8 ounces of corn starch. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

Vanilla flavoring. Little salt. 

Make same way as almond cream, boiling the 
grated chocolate in the milk. Make the meriogue 
white and very light baked; flavor it with almond 
«nd sift crimson sugar sand on top after baking. 

The object of baking the sheets of cake in the 
pans in which the meringue is made is to have them 
adhere to the bottom sufficiently to prevent their 
rising and floating in the cream mixture when 
poured in as otherwise they will do. Jelly cake 
sheets used this way have to be held to the bottom 
by means of a little beaten egg, baked by passing 
the pan a moment over the fire. 



441. Pineapple Oream Merln^rue. 



Eclipse Merinffue. 



1 quart of grated or minced pineapple, 

1 small cupful of port wine. 
i pound of sugar. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
4 ounces of butter. 

1 lemon rind grated. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

} pound of shred pistachio nuts. 

Stew the minced pineapple and wine and half the 
sugar together, till somewhat r* duoed and Hke fruit 
butter. Mix the starch and the rest of the 
sugar together, stir them and the butter into the 
pineapple add flavoring and yolks of egg 4. Bake 
this cream on bottom sheets of wtiiie cake. Mer- 
ingue over as usual Sift sugar on top befure baking 
and strew over the shred pistachio nuts. Dry bake 
to a fawn color with the oven door open. 

When these meringue puddings are to be set on 
the tab e whole, to be eaten cold the method has to 
be varied a little, by baking on jelly-cane pans with 
a stout paper hoop pinned or pasted around. But- 
ter the paper well, make the meringue in it instead 
of in a pan, then remove it carefully when the me- 
ringue is placed on its stand, being slipped from the 
j •lly-ca*' e fl t by means of a palet>e knif" In these 
cases the meringue can be placed in pyramidal form 
through a large tube or cornet forming dome shapes 
on top, etc , etc Here is one more for variety: 



449* Oranffe Oream Meringue. 
Natchez Merin^rue. 

To ornament the top of tbis, ctndled and sugared 
orange peel should be prepared, or green citron, or 
preserved water melon rind. The or nge peel first 
cut into the smallest possible squares is btewed in 
plenty of water to extract the biUer taste, then 
stewed in white syrup, then partly dried and rolled 
in granulated sugar to separate the pieces. Str< w 
this candied peel over the top of meringue after it- 
has become firm without removing it f^om the oven. 

The orange cream. 

8 oranges. 

1 lemon. 

i pound of sugar. 

2} pints of water (6 cups). 

3 ounces of corn starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

10 yolks of eggs 

Grate the rinds and squeeze the juice of oranges 
and lemon into the water, then bring it to a boil, 
add the starch and sugar and finish as directed for 
other kinds.

Very fine, cheap and wholesome. They are 
Qsuaiy boiled but can be raised and cooked io

well. 

2 pounds of good light bread dough. 

4 ounces of sugiir 

1 egg and 2 yolks, or 2 eggs. 

2 ounces of butter. 
1 pound of flour. 

If for midiJay dinner take the dough at seven in 
the morning, mix the sugar butter and eggs with it 
as well as can be, then set the pan in a warm place 
awhile, after which it can be beaten smooth. Work 



in the flour to make it a stiff d jugh again aid set it 
away to rise. At 11 o'clock work the dough by 
folding and presiiing out with the knuckles roll it 
out to a sheet, brush over s ightly with lard or but- 
ter, cut out like biscuits, let rise about half an hour - 
on greased pans, drop into boiling water and cook 
about 15 mioutes Butter and sugar or any kind 
of padding sauce, or rtewed fruit. 

The plain dough, or that of French rolls is often 
cooired as dumplings to be eaten with meat. The

to any desired degree.

Not as a matter of opinion as to what mif^t or 

ught to be the case but as a matter of fact it has to 
be observed again that the plain dumplings yeast- 
raised are but seldom made in ordinary hotels, the 
V wo or three manipulations required and the car y 
planning being against them In ten minutes a 
similar article can be made with soda and buitei^ 
milk or acid, or with baking powder, that answers 
every purpose. It is something of an art to make 
these so that they will remain light when done, yet 
it is a veiy simple one, the essential being only to 
have the dough very soft, made and dropped with a 
spoon like fritters.

Make same as macaroni pudding preceding. Bake 
in a pan, to be about an inch deep when done. Gut 
in strips, squares, or diamonds and serve with red 
froit jelly. 



450, Baked Vermioelli Pudding. 

The quality of vermicelli varies so much that no 
rate will serve tor all the sorts. Vermicelli ought to 
be parboiled and drained before being used for this 
porpose Some, however, will dissolve to a paste as 
soon as hot wat^ touches it. 

The same ingredients and proportions named .'or 
macaroni pudding serve for vermicelli. 

Boil a small piece of stick cinnamon in the milk ia 
lien of other flavoring. Break the vermicelli rather 
small before cooxing. Do not stir it except by shak- 
ing up with a fork. Always drop both vermicel i 
aod macaroni into milk or water that ia boiling 
already. 



Italian paste paddings, like everything else may 
have their day, but other pieces can be put upon the 
boards which will have a much more extensive run, 
especia'ly when presented in a spirite 1 manner, like 
the following with brandy or wine sauce. 



451. Baked Spoiiffe Puddixur. 

This is simply hot cake with sauce, and may be thb 
regular sponge cake mixture, but the following is 
easier, cheaper, and answers equally as well. 

1 pound of sugar. 
10 eggs. 

i pound of batter me' ted 
} pint of tepid milk. 
1} pounds of flour. 

2 teaspoonftils of baking powder. 

Beat the sugar and eggs in a kettle as if making 
sponge cake, but t wo or three minutes will do. Then 
add the other ingredients, the pow der just before the 
flour; beat up well, bake in shallow bakiog paos 
greased and floured, with granulsled sugar sified 
over the top before putting in the oven. The cake 
rises considerably and should be only half an inch 
deep when put in the pans. It should be baked of 
a very light color, and have a handsome g axed ap- 
pearance. Cut out in squares. Pienty of sauce is 
required. A suitable article to make on short 
notice, and may be varied by having raisius, etc., ' 
mixed in. 

The next is cottage pudding. It is supposed that 
in pastoral days it was called ?ove-in a-oottage pud- 
ding, because a very fkshionable belie said she saw a 
love of a pudding in tUe cottage wherb she stayed 
till the shower was over. But as love in a cotuge 
went out of fuhion, and it came to be love in a grand 
hotel with a suite of rooms and all the modern con- 
veniences the poor pudding lost half its title and 
remains as follows:

i pound of sugar.

6 eggs. 

1 pint of milk. 

H pounds of flour. 

8 teaspoonfals of baking-powder. 

Level teaspoonfUl of salt. 

Make up like pound cake, by creaming the sugar 
and butter together, adding the eggs two at a time, 
the milk and then the flour with powder and salt. 
Bake either in cake moulds and s ice like pound 
pudding, or else in a baking pan, shallow, to be cut 
in squares. Takes from twenty to forty minutes. 
Lemon syrup sauce is a good sukisiitute for nabeTvy 
vinegar. 



Rasberry vinegar is a favorite sauce with the 
English for all sorts of flour and egg puddings and 
pancakes. Directions for making it will be found at

THE AXBBIOAir P A8TST OOOK. 



From this timt forth stem dnij requirw ns to stay 
at home and deal only in American productions. In 
this little prirate exposition asmanj foreign coun- 
tries haTO been represented as small expositions 
generally can boast of. The space allott d Great 
Britain was necessarily the largest, but France was 
not tkt behind, albeit very few French flags were set 
to mark the nationa ity of the goods. One country 
is entire 'y unrepresented, that is Central AfHca; 
yet it is not the f uU of the culinary commissioners, 
but of the country itself. A careful examination of 
the books of Stanley's explorations ends fruitlessly. 
It appears p ainly that the interior of Africa, or the 
AfHcan's interior — and if there is any difference in 
the terms whichfver is right wi>l do — is altogether 
unacquainted with pudding. 453 

There is one nice pudding material which might, 
perhaps have been pieced in the rice departmt* nt of 
the Lower Nile but has been excluded through a 
pr^adioe against the label on the packages, which s 
a picture of ''natiyes maou&cturing manioca," and 
looks too much like **natives gathering chow ch«»w 
leaTcs for Doctor Helmbold's extract of ciiow 
chow." Manioca makes pudding quite equai to 
rice. Pound Some rice in a mortar, sift out the 
coarse, sift out the flour, use the middle, sago-like 
grains and you will not know it from manioca. ' The 
fkrina or rice pudding receipts will do for it. 

China ma es a fair showing if rice, yams, and 
birdsnesube credited to her. The East Indies 
has only one article, sago pudding, but that is quite 
impor ant iu its relation to this country. 

Every reader who will recall to mind the first 
American Indian romance he ever read will recol 
lect how they always used to greet each other with 
"Sago, sago, great chief!" Sago is the pith of a 
tree; and that is why the Indians got such a repu- 
tation tor short and pithy sentences. But there is 
more in it than thac. "Where did the Indians come 
from?" is a question never yet satisfactorily ans 
wered, notwithstanding the attempts to pr«>Ye them 
the lost ten tribes, and floaters across Behring's 
Straits. The word sago, it ii seen, is in spontan 
ecus use among them. Saco, sachem, saguache, 
saguiam etaego, (which the Eoglish used to pro- 
nounce hot-sago) and other words, all meanii g 
placed where they have something to eat are but 
corruptions or deviations from the same root. Sago 
is Asiatic. The sago tree which yields the ed ble 
pith is native in the East Indian islands Our 
Indians must have brought sago with them from 
that country. Now if the anthropo'cgical or some 
other suitable society would follow up this matter, 
perhaps they would be able tfi prove that our 
Indians came ftrom the land of sago in the East 
Indian Arobioelago, and thus settle a much mooted 
question. 

Our Indians have neverbeen accused of stupidity, 
but have often shown themselves to be true Amen 



cans by their ready appreciation of a good thing 
when they had it They had not been long in this 
country before they found out that American Indian 
com was far batter than East Indian sago, and so 
p eased were they with the discovery that — as is 
proven by Oatlin's magnificent worn on the North 
American Indians, and by the writings of all the 
poets and novelists from Longfellow down who have 
drawn their particulirs from that source — they 
instituted a green corn dance to take place yearly 
upon the first appearance of the succulent roasting- 
ears of which the following pudding is made:

1 quart of milk. 

Use tender roasting-ears. Free them carefully 
from silk Shave the corn from the cob with a sh«irp 
knife till you have the required amount — nearly two 
quarts. Melt the butter and stir it in, and the 
seasonings Beat the eggs and milk together; mix 
a>l; bake in a four quart milk pan about half an 
hour or till just set in the middle.

Individual Qreen Ck>m Pudding. 



Make tulip-shaped cups of the lower part of the 
green corn husks, the stem being cut 00*0 ose and 
the top edges ci*t rounded with a pair of shears. 
Dip the cups in hot, clear butter. Place them in 
gem pans of suitable size, fill with the c irn pud • 
ding preceding and bake in a slow oven from 10 to 
15 minutes without burning the husks out of color. 
When set lift the puddings out of the gem or muf- 
fin-paos and serve in the husks hot. 



As the green corn season is short, canned com has 
to do duty for it most of the year 

Two cans of the so called two-pound sise will 
make the receding amount That is if the honest 
canned corn be used, which is solid and has to be 
dug out with a spoon. When your house "gets 
stuck,*' on the fraudulent corn-and-water put up by 
the firm that dyes mulberries with logwood, for 
blHchberrie-i, and cans the logwood chips too, then 
use four cans instead of two; drain it as dry as 
pARsible and mash it^to a partial paste, to imitate tha 
iniveil green corn*

A book is advertised which foretells all the disas- 
t«n that will befiUl this poor earth in the next seven 



years. Also, at the same time, Scribner's publishes 
an article presaging to hotel people the calamity of 
an avalanche of dried peaches. Now, what have we 
done? It may be all very true ab ift the Delaware 
plains being " the peach garden of the continent, 
where the peaoh trees stand in rows a mi e long, 
luxuriating in a warm and mellow soil and a genial 
climate, and every farm counts its hundreds or 
thousands. There are forests of twenty thousand 
peach-trees standing in prim and stately lines. 
Some large eetates count ten, fifteen, or twenty 
thousand trees in one block. With a fair crop 
there will be five million baskets of peaches on these 
trees. A good crop will yield six million baskets — 
more peaches than the nation can eat while they are 
in good condition." That is pleasant ; so is this: 
"when, in April days, the blossoms of these million 
treei foretoken an abundant crop, the good news is 
telegraphed over the country." Tes, it is good news; 
everybody glories in millions ; we all love plenty. 
It is the conclusion that makes us unhappy. There 
is a new industry springing up. They have learned 
how to dry millions of baskets as peaches as easy as 
rolling off a log, as if there was not too many dried 
peaches already. The dried peach is a g od thing 
abstractly considered, yet, when presented in a 
practical shape to the hotel guest, a little of it goes 
quite a long way. The taste for it has to be cuiti 
vated, and it is tedious work for the cooks. Dried 
peaches keep well, but it does hotel people no par- 
ticular good to keep them. They might pay the 
Indians their annuities, perhaps, in dried peach* s, 
and get rid of the Delaware surplus in that way. 
If it will do any good towards checking the growing 
evil to show how to use up peaches, green or canned, 
here are a fsw ways to go on with, and some more 
may be studied up after awhile.

Not only in Delaware but in Maryland. Virginia, 
Tennessee, and we know not how many peach 
growing states beside, the kind of pie to be next 
described is called peaoh cobbler. Perhaps it 
would be as good by some other name, but being 
such a good medium for disposing of too plentiful 
truit its fkmiliar name that it can be readily called 
by had best not be tampered with The French 
name is jyArtois — D'Artois of peaches or cherries, 
etc, or D'Artois cake Ihere is a province of 
Artois in France which possibly may be as great a 
peach country as little De' aware. But the probi 
bility is that D' Artois of fruit gained its name from 
a Count D'Artoi**, who, they do say, was some akin 
to Marie Antoinette. Tbe English would scorn to 
call a peach cobbler anything but a peaoh pif, 
but as they cirnnot grow niillions of baskets of 
peaches— only a few on a warm a^'uth wall — they 
are not good authority on the subject. Like apple 
and peach charlottes, cobblers are good either in 
place of pudding or as sweet entrees.

A large pie baked in a shallow baking pan, from 
1 to 2 J inches in depth, with bottom and top crust, 
glazed and sugared on top and cut out in square or

Fine puff paste is too rich for this purpose. Ordi- 
nary flaky pie paste made with 10 or 12 ouooes of 
butter to a pound of flour is best. Cover the bottom 
of the fan with a sheet of paste rolled quite th n. 
Fill in with ripe peeled peaches, strew over them

Cover with another thin sheet of paste and bake 
about f hour. When half done brush over the top 
with rgg and water and strew granulated sugar 
over. Put back and bake it to a rich color. When 
the fruit is too dry to make its own a^rup make a 



sauoe to go with the cobb'er. A'1 sorts of fhiit and

be stewed down till the juice becomes thick before

Every one thus far has been a week-day pudding, 
that is to say, a hot. pudding.- Now a few are 
needed of another class. It does not seem to be 
quite well enough known that fashion has decreed 
it to be vulgar to eat hot pudding on Sunday, ex- 
cept at a railroad eating house, and it is vu'gar even 
there when the pudding is vtry hot and there is only 
ten ndnutes for dinner. The railroad companies do 
their part to guard the public against getting into 
such a predicament by running few or no trains oo 
Sundays. The various journals of civilisation never 
mention this new decree of fashion in their articles 
on tab e manners for the obvious reason that 
they cater only to the intellectual wants of 
first-class people who are already thor 
oughly informed. It would be very awkward 
for those journals to go about advising people not to 
eat hot pudding on Sunday who never do. It may 
be a little absurd to mention such a thing, but the 
cooks, and particularly those employed in hotels, 
are quite glad that hot Sabbath pudding is no longer 
countenanced by the best people. The change lets 
them out a little, and the result has not been, as 
some imagined, an overcrowding of the churches; 
many of those released proftssing to be well eaou^ 
p'eased with Strauss and Chopin, Verdi and Beeth 
oven in a so-called beer-garden Some talk about 
Whittier's broker f^ith and Bryant's idea of the 
woods being God's first temples, and Byron's pleas 
ure in the pathless woods and rapture on the lonely 
shore, or something of the sort. At any rate it is 
said they do better and morecarefiil wor< and show 
more natural energy and less pernicious stimu^a- 
ti' n after the rest afforded through the abolition of 
hot Sabbath pudding What, then, shall theiv be 
no more pudding after church? Yes, certainly 
there shatl be puddings plenty and of the most 
delicate and delicious descriptions but they are not 
good unless quite cold.

the custard in cups, place them in a steamer and 
steam fifteen minutes, takiog care they do not be- 
come cooked enough to curdle. Pile the meringue 
on top while they are still hot, set the cups in a 
baking pan and bake the tops very slightly. They 
may also be cooked by setting in a pan of water in 
the oven, but with more injury to the cups than by 
steaming

flavors, they always siip up in trying to guess what 
gives caramel creams and custards such a pleasant 
taste. 

46ir. 

Oaramel Oustard Meriuiruo. 

2 quarts of milk, or part cream. 

f pound of sugar. 

18 eggs. 

2 teaspoonfuls of almond extract. 

Four ounces of the sugar is to make the caramel, 
which must not be black like that used for coloring 
Put the sugar in a little brass kettle and set it on 
the fire without water. It will melt and turn brown. 
When it looks like golden syrup pour in a quart of 
the milk and let boil till the caramel is dissolved. 

Separate enough of the eggs to get out ten or 
twelve whites for the meringue Beat the others 
into the remaining quart of milk, add the sugar and 
flavor, mix in the caramel milk and bake till barely 
set in the middle. If not wanted meringued use 
fewer eggs. It is less necessafy Sa meringue this 
than chocolate oustard, which does not look well 
without.

} pound of sugar — more with soiir apples. 

f pound of best Aresh butter. 

2 tea«poonful8 of ground cinnamon. 

2 pounds of sweei psste for the crust. 

For the last named article, ' home folks'* use com- 
mon cookie dough, hotel cooks use sweet tart paste 
because it is easier to b^ke without burning. 

Break the butter in bits in two frying-pins, set 
on the range, and when melted put in the apples 
(pared and cored of course) and try them slowly 
and carefully till done. Put in the sugar and 
ground cinnamon and cook a little longer. The 
apples are expected to look brown. 

Butted a baking-pan and line it with the sweet 
paste rolled out thin; put in the apples and coyer 
with a thin crust Bake as long as you can with- 
out sco'chiug — about three-quarters of an hour. 
Turn the cake out, upside down on a board or sheet 
of tin and cut it in blocks or squares to serre

and many other articles, such as shell pies to be 
baked the day before and filled with preserres.

and extract. Bake in a shallow pan about twenty 
or thirty minutet. 

The preceding is everybody's aoquaintanoe and 
for a oold pudding is excellent without sauoe or any 
other addition. When ic turns watery it is because 
of too much baking. But when it is denred to add to 
it some of our abundant Aruit^, which would har- 
monise with ii so well, an unpleasantjtate of fluidity 
results in spite of otireful baking Then the cooks 
say it 48 the fault of water in the milk, and blame 
the cows for going and standing in the river, as they 
are known to do, soaking themselves through and 
through far houis at a time. The difficulty can 
be overcome and a nice line of fruit custards made 
in the following way.

ADDBNDA. 



Queen Mab's pudding it is not unlikely may have 
been the predecessor of well-known charlutte russe 
The writer remembers first seeing the name in a 
little cook-book by a titled lady, that must have 
been published half a century ago. It has since 
reappeared in m>iny places. Queen Mab's pud 
ding, is a charlotte made by lining a mould with 
lady-fingers striped with red jelly, and filling with 
the gelatine cream tbat is variously called lemon 
cream, velvet cream, [creme veloute)^ jaune-mange, 
and perhaps others names. It is not the purpose 
here to enter into the methods and merits of gela 
tine creams, and a short course will be taken with 
this: 



4TB. Queen Mab's Puddinff. 



Individual Oharlottes 



Spread some small lady fingers thickly with firm 
red currant jelly and place by twos together, then 
cut them lengthwise into stripes and line custard 
cups with these sojhat there will be red aud jellow 
stripes all round for the outsi le They may be 
kept in position by slightly wetting the edges of the 
cake in white of egg. It U well enough for pre- 
caution to wipe out the cups first with a touch of 
olive oil. 

For the filling make a rich boiled custard. To 
each quart allow an ounce of ge'atine, {it used to be 
isinglass), dissolved in water separate, or beaten in 
the milk while on the fire, which is the shorter way. 



F avor with lemon Strain. When cold and so 
nearly set that the cakes cannot rise and float in it 
pour this lemon cream into the lined cups, set on 
ice and turn them out when firm. May be orna- 
mented on top with jelly and whipped cream around 
in the saucers. 



Corrections. 



The bread custard rece pt, and a few others like 
it near the beginning of this book should have 
been written, two slightly pressed quarts cf bread 
crumbs, instead of pressed in or' full-pressed 
While a loose quart of bread crumbs has scarcly 
any weight it is found on the other hand that 
pastry cooks comiog down on it with a pressure of 
fifty pounds to the square inch Qiake much more of 
a cake and much less of a custard than the writer 
does of the same receipt. 

Also the few people who know how to cook rice 
dry, as it ought to be, wiU probably find the rice 
costard pudding requires in their hands about a 
pint more milk. 

Use less baking-powder than is directed for Cot- 
tage Pudding. The amount there specified is 
enough for twice the quantity. See variations and 
adulterations of baking-powder in Book of Breads 

There has been a painstakirg effort throughout 
this entire serif's to make each and every receipt so 
reliable that any person might choose among them 
with a reasonable certainty of success as complete 
on the first trial as at any subsequent time.

4T8. "^ine Sauce for PuddinffS. 



2 pounds of granulated sugar. 

1 teaoupful of water, 

1 pint of wine. 

1 dozen whole cloves. 

} a lemon. 

1 blade of i 



^Melt the sugar in the cup of water on the fire 
taking care it does not burn while dissolving. Throw 
in the spices and the lemon cut in bits — the seeds 
excluded — and let simmer to draw the flavors.. 
Remove fh>m the fire and add the wine, then strain. 
It should not boil after the wine is added. 



The foregoing is not qcite a simpie matter, or one 
for set instructions. Color is desirable in most cases 
and the wine is not always sufficient. Then ar- 
tificial means must be employed. The wines of Oal- 
ifomia are, happily, coming into use cheap enough 
for such purposes as these, and with the probabilities 
in favor of their purity. They are not always of 
desirable color. Burnt sugar caramel will make 
your sauce sherry or madeira color. Carmine, which 
is the coloring principal of C'lchineal, will make a 
handsome claret color, 'provided there be lemon 
juice or any > cid in the sauce, otherwise it is apt to 
make an unpleasant purple. Caramel and carmine 
mixed make port wine color ; but let the tints be 
weak rather than be overdone. 

Pudding sauces could perhaps be classified in four 
divisions, but they ought not, because it niay almost 
be said the more unmethodical our methods in this 
line can be the better. Not of course, the methods 
of making sauces, but of their application. This 
matter, almost inexplicable, it will be our task to 
talk at and around about in a succeeding column. 

The sauces at present touched upon it will be 
observed have had nothing in them to give body to 
their linked sweetness but pure sugar and fur richness 
only wine. 8o when more wine in used or when 
fruit or fruit juice insteid, more sugar has to be 
added for thickening for sweetened water or liquor 
is not desirable for anytbiog but a French beverage 
They tell of a notable French mnn who was so de- 
lighted when loaf sugar was first made that he 
declared when the price got down to two franco per 



pound he ^ould drink nothing but sugar-and- 
water. Surely sod t-fountains and raspberry and 
pineapple syrups had never then been thought of 
else why such a homely fancy?

J pint of port or claret wine 

Dissolve the sugar in the pineapple juice. Bring 
to a boil, strain, then add the wine and pineapple, 
keep hut without boiling. 

Instead of the wine half a pint of water and a 
few drops of red coloring — to make the sauce pink 
only — can be used. 



Red raspberries can be used in the place of pine- 
apple with the difference that the berries should be 
dropped singly into the boiling syrup while it is still 
thick and never be stirred In this way they retain 
their proper shape while coloring and flavoring the 
syrup. No wine needed. 

- Yery handsome sauces of other kinds of fhiit are 
made in the way above iodicated, by adding it to a 
strong syrup made with ha.f fruit juice and half 
water. White sweet grapes which furnish no syrup 
may be used to advantage thrown whole into boiling

■ Garaoao is a cordial made by steeping orange peel 
in proof spirit and then adding to the flayored spirit 
three times as much simple syrup. It is brandy 
colored. As a substitute make the clear syrup

pint to two pounds. Strain, flavor slightly with peach 
or almond extract, and add a quarter pint of gin. £x 
cellent for steamed paddings, rice and farina cakes 
and fried cream fritters. 



As long as butter and honey, silver drips and 
maple syrup are applied in such lavish proportions 
to horel waffles, hot breads and cakes as is the 
present custom there will be no reason to make 
excuse for the excessive sweetness of these clear 
syrup sauces. Rich as they are they can go a degree 
higher for such things as sponge puddings and 
boiled puddings of flour.

Boil all together ten minutes — the lemon cut in

j nice of the lemon is essential to brighten the color 

of the sauce.

1 pound of powdered sugar. 

8 ounces of butter, (large cap).

J cupful of brandy, or else nearly } pint of wine 
and no water. 

Warm the butter slightly in a bright pan, put the 
sugar with it and cream them by rubbing together 
as if for cake. Then set it on the range and while 
beating with an egg-whisk in one hand pour in the 
brandy and water or wine, with the other. When 
hot enough to s*rve it is ready. It must not boil, as 
that destroys its silvery whiteness and makes a gray 
syrup of it. Takes but a few minutes and should be 
made last thing. Good for souffle puddings of f^uit, 
drop dumplings and b'>iled puddings.

enough to coat the article and barely run enongh to

list preceding it is hardly practicable — they would be 
almost candy. The next sett are better for gloss. 

400. Corn Staroh Syrup Sauoe.

like the preceding and stew ^ pound raisins in it. 
Use the raisins as a garnish with the sauce. 

And then the transparent sauce goes still further.

1 pint of water. 
1 pint of thick sweet 
} cup of red fhiit sTrup. 
Vario'is flavorings. 

Tbe making of this sauce will be beet understood 
by the explanation that it is a pearly cream sauoe 
with a mixture of bOTeral agreable flavors. It should 
be pearl pink. Of old, when the spices, almonds, 
lem n zest, and flavors oif nectarine and peach h^d to 
be prepared separately this sauce . became a serious 
affair. Now, by boiling cinnamon, coves and 
grated peel in the pint ot water, fetirriog in the 
sugar and starch, then the cream, and judiciously 
adding drops of various extracts the sauoe can be 
made as j^ood as need be in a few minutes. It must 
be strained, of course. 



499. Raspberry Vinegar Sauoe. 



Vinaigre Framboise. 



The various firuit vinegars used extensively for 
sauces and beverages in Europe are but little enquir- 
ed for in the United States, but probably need only 
to be better known to be appreciated. The native 
wild raspberry of the Rocky Mountains, with its 
peculiar aromatic flavor and bright scarlet color and 
juice doubtless contains new possibilities in relishes 
and onofections, and could be cultivated to an unlim 
ited extent among its native barrens. Duiing is 
short season in the towns about which it grows it ha:! 
no rival amcTig fruits and brings a higher price than 
any other. 

To make raspberry vinegar, half fiU a stone jar 
with ripe raspberries of any kind, and pour ia pure 
cider vinegar enough to a little more than cover 
them. Let stand in a warm place twenty >four 
hours. Mash the berries in the jar; strain and 
press through a cloth and then run the liquor 
through the flannel jelly bag. To each pint allow a 
pound of sugar if for present use or two pounds if 
to be bottled. Boil and skim and it is leady for use 
when made cold. It can be kept in preserving jars 
or cans a long time, put up in the usual manner, or 
in stone jugs, sealed while hot and painted outside 
to exc ude air 



**Mio amieo, why do you, residing in the BauU- 
vard det Italuru, Pay* Oulmaire, yet writing Frenefa, 
caU that sambaoine which the French call n^ay&n, 
even when writing Fiench?" 

"Only because the French themselves call tbe same 
thing by two different names. The sauce or hot spirit* 
uous beverage is of Italian origin, and hae come down 
flrom the time when Italian cookery was in the 
ascendent, but the Italian spelling is Mombaerfm, the 
j being pronounced like i." 

Then I as tied my meal-eolored German elf what 
in his country they know about aabajf<m. He 
answered : "Why that is rfr«i/«<i;--only**— he adds, 
"when made slightly different with wine it is 
sehaito,** 

Th.en I asked the great Columbian oracie and he, 
smilingly answered, ' why that is scarcely different 
from Thomas and Jeremiah, — only we do not cook 
our tom-and-jerry quite so much as you cooks do." 

Then I went to an expert Englishman and asked 
him— **Say, Johnny I what is that sauce you make 
for plum pudding when you don*t have the common 
brandy sauce?" 

"That," says he, "is German Custard Sauoe,*' 

"Whst is its French name?" 

"Sabayon." 

Enough said. They are distinctions without 
much difference. The confusion comes from the 
same compound being mentioned in a Babel of many 
tongues. If an intelligent person but learn the 
base he can build up as many variations as heplease» 
himself. 

Tbe base may be learned by boiling a quart of 
Rhine wine, throwing in rugar enough to pleasantly 
sweeten, and a little spice ; then stirring in enough 
beaten yolks to thicken it to a custard-like consis- 
tency — about 10 yolks to a quart — and taking off 
before it quite boils. Mulled wine, a hot beverage, 
is an elaboration of this, having the whites of the 
eggs beaten to a froth and stirred into the nearly 
boiling mixture tbe minute before serving. 



Sauoe Sabayon. 



For plum puddings, fritters, etc.

pan as if making egg-nogg. Set the saucepan on the 
range ; siir in tbe wine a little at a time, and then 
with the egg- whisk whip the mixture to a froth till 
it has become hot and begins to thicken. It must 
not quite boil, and ought to be made only just be- 
fore it is needed. Either powdered cinnamon, vanlUn, 
or extracts can be added fur flavor. Brandy or mm 
mixed with the wine is generally considered an lis- 
provement.

503. Paper Cases for Individual 
Charlottes. 

iTocure half a dozen sheets of cap or fine book 
paper, which is like writing paper not ruled, and 
make a pattern for the paper cases by fitting a band 
of paper to the outside of a very small tumbler, 
such as is used for Roman punch, or some similar 
small shape. The band of paper, when cut to fit, 
will form a curve. Cut as many such pieces as are 
needed from the sheets, and then, placing three or 
four together, cut both top and bottom edges into 
fringe a quarter of an inch or less in depth. Make 
some corn starch paste very stiff, and paste the ends 
of the bands together, forming cup shapes, then cut 
around the edges, press the fringe bottom edges of 
the cups on to the paste, the fringe bent outward, 
and the shapes are made. 

503. Strawberry Charlottes in Oases 

'or Fifty. 

Having prepared 50 paper cases of about the 
capacity of very small tumblers, according to the 
directions in the preceding article; next bake 6 
sheets of cake of any kind that is suitable to roll up, 
or of the following, which b right in quantity for 50 
small charlottes. 

3 rounded cupfuls of granulated sugar — 1^ 
pounds. 

15 eggs. 

i cup of water. 

4 rounded cupfuls of flour — 18 ounces. 
Separate the eggs. Beat the yolks, sugar and 

water rapidly for ten minutes. 

Have the flour weighed or measured ready 
Whip the whites perfectly firm. Stir the flour into 
the beaten yolks, and the whipped whites last. 

Spread thinly on sheets of blank paper not 
greased, and bake in a quick oven about 6 minutes. 

Careful baking b required, because if dried or 
burnt the cake will break. 

Brush the paper, under side, with water, and it 
can be pulled off the cake. Should any of the sheets 
become too dry to roll or bend in spite of care in 
baking, lay them on top of each other after wetting 
the paper, and let lie so half an hour. 

Cut out the pieces of cake by the same paper pat- 
tern the shapes were cut by, but a trifle shorter, and 
put the lining of cake in the paper cases. No 
bottom of cake is needed, but little square pieces 
can be pushed down inside if wished. 

A short time before serving fill the charlottes with 
the cream intended for the purpose. 

504. Strawberry Whipped Cream for 

Fifty. 

I quart of red strawberries. 
6 pints of thick sweet cream. 
1 pound of sugar — 2 cupfuls. 
li ounces of gelatine — a package. 



Cover the fruit with the sugar in a bowl, mash 
together and rub through a seive. 

Dbsolve the gelatine in a cup of mUk extra, in a 
small vessel set in a place where it will warm gradu- 
ally. When the gelatine b dissolved put the cream 
into a pail or pan, take the large wire egg whisk and 
whip it to a froth, pour in the gelatine, and continue 
whipping, with the pan set on ice; then add the 
strawberry pulp or syrup, and when it U firm 
enough, and before it is quite set, fill the individual 
charlottes with it, well piled above the edge 

Cream without fruit, and only flavored with 
strawberry extract, does not need any gelatine. 



505. 



Peaches and Cream. 



The harder kinds of peaches should be chopped to 
the size of strawberries and mixed with sugar two or 
three hours before the meal. Allow about four 
ounces of sugar to a quart. Soft peaches, after peel- 
ing, are best only quartered or sliced. If admissible, 
serve them in large glass bowls ornamented with 
quarters of red or yellow peaches placed in order 
and a pitcher of cream with each bowl separately. 
If served individually in saucers, pour the cream 
over only as they are dished up. 



5oe. 



Compote of Apples. 



Thb is but another term for apples stewed in 
syrup. A compote of fruit is understood to be dif- 
ferent from stewed fruit, in being richer with sugar 
and the fruit being either whole or in large pieces. 

Fine ripe apples of a kind that have proved to be 
good to cook make a delightful sweet dbh for tea in 
this way: 

4 large apples. 

1 cupful of sugar. 

J cupful of water. 

Piece of orange peel or lemon peel, or cloves, or 
stick cinnamon for flavoring. 

Put the sugar, orange peel and water on to boil in 
a de^p saucepan. Pare the apples, cut each one in 
three and cut out the cores. Drop three or four 
pieces at a time into the boiling syrup, and let sim- 
mer about fifteen minutes, or until done and almost 
transparent ; take them out with a fork, and cook 
some more in the same syrup, and so on till all are 
done. Serve in dessert saucers. The apples can be 
colored pink by adding red fruit juice or currant 
jelly to the syrup. 

50T. Pineapple Sweet Salad. 

1 pineapple. 

1 teacupful of powdered sugar 

i cup of maraschino. 

Peel a pineapple, cut it into uniform slices and 
cover them with the sugar in a glass dish. Let it 
remain to form a syrup, and when to be served add 
the maraschino.

All the Mystery that Pertains to Teast 

511. 

Stout Party : "What deMeious bread you haye 
Who is your baker?'* 

Brtllat'Savarin : "Limet, io Rue de Richelieu 
He supplies the royal ftkmily; but I send there be- 
cause it is near, and continue doing so because ,1 
have proclaimed him to be the first bread-maker in 
the world" 

Stout Party : "I must take a note of his address 
I am a great eater of bread, and with such rois as 
those I could almost dispense with eyerything else." 



It is one of the most natural occurences in the 
world, when trayeliog hotel patrons stop at a good 
hotel — no matter what the rate per day if situated 
in the midst of the land of sweet butter— and find 
on the table hot rolls that are remarkably light, well- 
baked, w611-shaped, thin-crusted, soft, white, sweet, 
fine-grained, delicious and just splendid; so that 
/ley think they "could almost dispense with eyery- 
thing else;" for them to ask somebody as a special 
fkyor to procure them the receipt to make them by. 
But, more*s the pity, they seldom deriye any benefit 
from the reply; not only because the ingredients are 
but seldom weighed or measured, and the pastry 
cook may be unable and unwilling to supply the 
information, but because in the nature of the case 
the receipt is but a small part of a little system of 
bread-making that has to be faithftdly followed from 
small beginnings to great results, if uniformly fine 
rolls and bread are to be produced ; and that little 
^stem IS yet so large that it cannot be explained 
quite all in a minute. Happily howeyer, bread-makiog 
is not a yery complicated afiair compared with other 
branches of cookery where each new article may 
require a different method, but this ence learned 
becomes little more than a matter of routine. The 
first step is making the yeast. 



Common Teast, or Baker's Ferment. 

5ia. 

About 24 potatoes. 

2 pounds of flour. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

1 quart of stock yeast. 

Wash the potatoes thoroughly, using a brush for 
the purpose, and boil them in a kettle of water 
When done pour off what remains of the dark water 
and fill up again with fresh. When that boils turn 
out potatoes and boiling water on to the flour in a 
large pan and mash all to a smooth paste. Throw 
in the sugar. Thin down with ice water till like 
thick cream. Set the large colander oyer your 6- 
gallon stone jar (justflresh scalded out) and strain 
the yeast into it. When it is no more than about 
milk warm mix in the stock or other yeast to start 
it. Let stand in a moderately warm place, undis- 
tnrbed, for firom 12 to 24 hours—according to 



weather, aotiyity, and need of using It will then 
be ready for use, and should be kept cold 

Not much in that; yet it was once the subject of 
an Bnglish (latent. Somewhere between 1825 and 
1885. And in the days of our daddies was kept a 
profound secret and termed patent yeast, London 
yeast, and patent London potato yeast, long after 
the patent had expired. Now it is used in almost 
eyery household where bread Is made. 

To ayoid sourness in this fbrment it is quite essen- 
tial that the flour be well scalded, which is the rea- 
son for filling up the kettle the second time to haye 
plenty of boiling water to pour oyer it along with 
the potatoes. 



Ought not the potatoes be pared? 

Yts, they ought to be. In nice little hotds kept 
by ladies they are pared and the eyes scooped out. 
All the bakers wi 1 do that way when the millen« 
nium comes. At present the bakers haye a sort of 
superstition that the potato skins make the yeast 
stronger, and if it should fkil to be good would ba 
sure to lay the blame to the paring of the potatoes. 
Howeyer, they are obliged to wash them yery clean, 
and if they did not pour off the first water they are 
boiled in, its blackness would iigure their bread. 



There is no salt in the receipt. Ought not salt be 
added? 

It need not be. It seems about all the priyatf 
house authorities add salt. The baker's supersti- 
tions all are against it. Most bakers will not put 
salt in their first sponge. Salt in yeast probably 
does no harm; it certainly does no good. This little 
book teaches to make bread with such ease, certain- 
ty, and indiffisrence to trifle-i that you will be at 
liberty to do either way without impairiog success 



Not so with sugar. It has a chemical effect that 
is yery obseryable. People can go on for years 
making good bread without, but they neyer discoyer 
how quicK and strong yeast can be until they try 
the sugar experiment. 

513. 

But there is stock yeast mentioned. Where are 

we to get that? 

By all means make your own if you haye to make 
bread constantly and regularly, no matter in what 
quantity, for stock can be made either by the barrel 
or bottleful, and needs be made only once a month, 
because stock is not put into bread direct, but only 
used to make the common yeast or ferment. 

It costs only the trouble of making, the materials 
being almost too trifling in expense to count. Of 
course you can shuflBe along without. Some hotel 
pastry cooks do so all their liyes, neyer knowing 
bow to make stock. But then they are always de- 
pendent, begging from those who are unwilling to 



(84 



THE AMERICAN PASTE7 COOK. 



fiTe or sell it. Or else Uiej use ferment to start 
with over and over a^ain, and it carries the germs 
of Boetio fermentation, or seeds of sourness all the 
time; it is weak and makes rotten dough, while 
with stook used to start with eyery time, or at least 
alternately, it is the most difficult thing to make 
dough or bread become sour, even if you were to 
try it. 

Some who go on using the lifeless ferment made 
with ferment for years, blaming the flour and the 
luck, are astonished after all to find yeast made with 
perfect stock turning out rolls and loaTes twice as 
large and twice as good as e?er they had known 
them before. 

Stock yeast is the foundation comer stone of a 
trade. The receipt for making it is ncTer published. 
It is too Taluable to be spread broadcast in a news- 
paper, yet some way will be indicated at the end of 
this book by which those who really need it my ob- 
tain the desired information. 

But if no stock yeast, what then? 

A quart or more of good ferment flram the shop of 
A good baker is the best substitute. Next to that is 
dry hop yeast in cakes, (they are mude from stock 
yeast) not good f r making bread direct because of 
their taste, perceptible to all persons critical about 
their bread, but good to start ferment along with 
sugar. Use a liberal amount — about 6 cakea to each 
gallon of ferment made. Make a new start that way 
about once a month and use ferment for starting at 
other times. 



There are no hops. Don't you use hops in mak- 
ing yeastr 

Tes, in all cases where no stock can be had, tie up 
4 ounces of hops in a piece of muslin, boil them 
with the potatoes in the second water, and press 
out the liquor through the colander when straining 
theyeaH Hops are not needed;with stock for 
starting, as that is already bitter with them. 



The baker or pastry cook who makes perfect 
yeast is nsturally reluctant to take chances on other 
people's on making a new commencement, and will 
prefer to take along his own in the following easy 
and reliable manner. 



514. 



Dry Hop Teast. 



I pint of strong, thick, stock yeast. 
1 pint of fresh ferment. 
1 pound of com meal. 

1 pound of flour. 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

By thick stock is meant some that is not watered 
down to the common point of using, but left with 
more consistence for this purpose. 

Mix all together to a stiff dough, without knead- 



ing. Gut out in suitable cakes and dry them in a 
oool place as quickly as possible, turning oTcr tn 
quently. If covered with meal and dried under a 
slight pressure of board and weight till so much of 
the moisture is expelled that they cannot ferment, 
these cakes will be as free from breakage as the dry 
J east of the stores. Either way they will be found 
Tcry strong and ready both for bread or yeast 
making. 

515. 

A brand of dry yeast with a German name that is 

sold in tin-foil packages, is made as aboye with 
starch and flour. The starch absorbs more moist- 
ure — takes up more yeast. 



There are then scTcral kinds of yeast. Of com- 
pressed yeast, the all in all and first necessity with 
manybakers, this little book will not haye much to 
say. It is neither better nor worse than that we make 
ourseWes Its one merit is that it saves the trouble 
of making either stock or ferment In the largest 
hotels which have bakeries attached it is used and, 
saying labor, is as cheap as any. But it has to be 
purchased, and in the ordinary hotel and boarding 
house, after a month or two, the question inyariably 



"Can't you make your own yeastT So and so 
does, and they have splendid bread." 

Then the cook or pastry makes his own, and 
rather liking the independence it gives him, and 
not caring to change methods every month, the prac- 
tice of using homemade yeast becomes the hotel 
rule. 

All ignorant imaginings of luck, chance, water- 
witchery, mystery, hidden knowledge, moon's age 
and the like having to do with fermeuution should, 
one would think, have been banished long before 
this ; but such is not the case, as we are often re- 
minded seeing how easily even some old hands will 
give up trying under the least stress of accident 



Two men, a few months since, started a "French 
Bakery" — so their handsome new sign bad it — in 
the livest new city on the continent. The capitalist, 
wiih five years savings of some plodding business; 
the other partner, a routine shop baker firom an 
eastern dty. Large sise portable oven procured at 
great expense, very large tent, all other fixtures 
suitable , high hopes of course, scores of such begin- 
nings had become fioe stores doing a rushing busi 
ness First opening dny bread very bad — gray 
color lixe rye — Aill of holes — rolls all run together

called referees, proved best flour in the state. Next 
day bread no better, could not be worse^blamed 
water, oven, dough trough, weather. Next day

climate, salt. Ran to place of one of referees whera

that town any more, because he had made his first 
yeast in tbe wrong quarter of the moon I Sold out 
for a song--oapitali8t raised enough to go back home 
with— baker lost. 



Another case. The steward of a good hotel where 
tHe finet bread was known to be made, was sought 
by the owner of a bakery that had been running 
with t^ood Buce« ss for some time. 

**What bniud of flour do you ufe? I must get some 
or olo&e my shop. I haye no more go.d bread and 
my trade is leaving me." 

'*We use the best — such a brand.*' 

"Why, I haye that, but they must haye changed 
quality on me." 

'•That does not seem possible, for you got the other 
half of the same oar load as ours. Perhaps you will 
find the Ikult is with your baker. Be did well in 
warm weather; now the nights are cold. His yeast 
has run out " 

Correct. Some changes, and the business recoyer- 
ed and has grown. 



In one of those Florida hotels, years ago, they tried 
to do without engaging a pastry cook for the season, 
and might have got along yery well had it not been 
flor theinscruttble mystery that so eoyelops yeast as 
to make it impossible for ordinary home folk to ever 
penetrate to the bottom of it. The company was 
eoming but the yeast would not come nor the light 
bread. The family carryall was sent fi'ty miles for 
a baker, in haste. He came, he saw, he made some 
mash and poured it yery warm into their cold and 
inert yeast, and in an hour it was all life, overflow- 
ing the top and filling another jar besides. Such 
wonderflii witchcraft as he understood they never 
could expect to learn, so he had to stay the season 
through. It was well for him that he understood 
yeast. 



Scientists tell us that yeast is a plant, a festive 
801 1 of microscopic fungus, or multitudinous mass 
of it, of exuberant growth under tie usuual condi- 
tions favorable to pi mt life. There is any desired 
amount of natural philosophy besides the above to 
be found in studying the singular ways of yeast, 
such as the different kind of fermentation and the 
changes produced in the flour, but the really practi- 
cal thing for bread-makers' profit to remember i" 
that one point that yeast is a plant and to be cared 
as such As plants grow &st under the influence of 
warmth and moisture so does yeast Hot water 
poured into a bed of plants will kill them and the 
I excess of heat kills yeast, whether the ferment 



be too hot iito which (he starting yea t is poured, 
or whether the dough be made too hot when it U set 
with yeast in it to rise. Asa root or seed will be in 
the ground for months without growing if the 
ground be cold so will yrast remain without life in 
a similar condition. And as a pUnt may be un- 
naturally forced to a sickly rapidity of growth till it 
fiills of its own weight so do yeast and dough act 
when they are hurried too much by being kept as 
hot as they can be without killing them. 

The best bread and yeast are made by giving 
plenty of time and gentle temperature fur all the 
processes to be carried out in a natural manner. 

Accidental freexing solid does not kill yeast, nor 
seem to injure it. This refers only to common de- 
grees of coM, not extremes.

In fact, great emphasis has been laid upon the 
quality and manufacture of bread from early times, 
when the whitest and finest was called simnel cakes, 
and was concocted chiefly to please the palate of the 
rich and high-born, as welt as the wastel bread, not 
quite so aristocratic; whi^e the tourle, or twisied 
loaf, and black bread made fivm the coarsest por- 
tion of the wheat, or from some inferior grain, fell 
to the share of the poor. 

Nowadays we have^discovered that the coarse Ikre 
furnishes more nutriment, and the rich have adopt- 
ed it and made it popular — IIarper*s Bastar. 

Every cure of corpulence must begin with these three 
mxxims or absolute principles : discretion in eating, 
moderation in sleep, exercise on foot or horsebacn. 
To abstain more or lean rigorously from all that 
is floury and starchy tends to lessen corpulence. 
You like bread; then eat brown or rje bread 
At breakfast, take brown bread aii a matter of 
course, and chocolate rather than coffpe. Strong 
coffee, however, with milk , may be conceded Eat 
as little of the crumb of bread as possible. — Oaslrono' 
my as a I\m Art, 



Perfect yeast, quick and strong, and so sweet and 
tastele&s that no harm can result from using it 
plentifully is the first requirement for making perfect 
bread and the quality of the flour is next tobe tak<^n 
into account. The flour is too generally madA to 
bear all the blame of poor bakings. A good bread 
maker with good yeast c n make better bread from 
second rate flour than a second rate workman gen- 
erally can from the finest. Yet in good hands the 
finest flour will produce rolls and loaves half as 
large again for their weight as those made of infe- 
rior flour. Shop bakers who have to count their 
profit by the number of loaves that a barrel of flour 
can be made to produce, know that several mor^ 
loaves of the same weight, and of larger sixe, can hk 
made from fine flour than fh>m coarse, showing that 
the best takes up most water, and from the bread-

The usual testa for flour do not generally amount 
to much in assisting the buyer, The miller's brand 
is his trade mark, and most of them try to keep up 
the quality of their best at an eyen degree of exoel 
lenoe. The brand is often the best guide. 



If two or three samples of flour are placed in the 
hand side by side, and smoothed with a silyer knife, 
the finest may be known by its greater fVeedom 
from bran. Tet when one sample is flrom red wheat, 
another from white, the appearances may be deoep- 
tiye. White wheat does not make the whitest bread, 
in a general way. A handful of flour pressed in 
the hand, if good, will retain its shape, while coarse 
flour falls apart like sand. Yet the best flour new- 
ly ground will not answer to this test, and poor 
flour with age will. 



Spring wheat flour may be white, but will not, 
nnless in exceptional cases, make rolls and loayes 
of as good shape as winter wheat flour, they haying 
a tendency to run out of shape, the dough being soft 
and sticky. It is winter wheat flour that makes the 
tall round handsome rolls and loayes. 



Good flour is slow to go through the seiye, rolls 
up in balls and coats the sides. Poor flour passes 
through like buckwheat or meal. 



Flour improyes with keeping, especially in white- 
ness. It should haye six months age before beiog 
used for fine rolls. Bakers sometime buy flour thai 
has become caked ia the barrels throu/h long keep- 
ing, and mix portions of it with the newer flour to 
impart whiteness and strength. 

It often improyes the bread to mix two or three 
brands of flour together, particularly when one is 
older than the other. Spriog wheat flour may be 
beat worked off by haying some old winter wheat 
flour to mix with it. 

But this is all on the common assumption that 
good flour means fine, white flour, and the crowning 
glory of bread-making is to haye bread snowy-white 
and delicate in taste and texture. A yery large 
minority in our hotels, howeyer, make known their 
preference for yarious kinds of bread of a coarser 
Bort. 



Graham flour should be the unbolted meal of 
wheat, but not ooly that, the wheat should be good 
plump grain, suoh as would make fine flour. Very 
often the appearance and handling is such that 
graham flour seems little else than bran and shorts, 
aa if the thinnest wheat had been got rid of in that 
■hape. In other samples the flour is made by taking 
seconds flour and mixiog in an indefinite amount 



of bran, defhiuding the consumer of the finest por- 
tion of the flour altogether. The best remedy is to 
buy suoh flour only of a reputable miller who makes 
it a special care to select good wheat^generally 
white wheat — for the purpose. Another remedy is 
supplied by the proportions of the following receipts. 



51T. 



Graham Bread. 



A standing article on the bill of fare of most hotels. 

2 pounds of graham flour, not sifled. 

1 pound of white flour. 

1} pints of warm water. 

} pint of yeast. (1 cup). 

1 teaspoonfdl of salt. 

Commence 7 or 8 hours before time to bake. Mix 
the yeast and water together ; strain them into the 
graham. It makes a stiff batter. That is the sponge. 
Let it stand in a moderately warm place about 4 
hours. Then add the white flour, knead and pound 
the dough. Very slightly grease the pan it was 
started in, place the lump of dough in it, bru^h th^t 
oyer — no matter how slightly — with the butter brush 
and set to rise 2 hours more. Then make into 
loayes, rise and bake. 

Graham dough rises fhster than white, and after 
being made into loayes should not be a lowed to rise 
or proof too much, lest it be too crumbly to slice 
well. The bakers usually bake these in round 
moulds. 



Taking fine French rolls for the standard, graham 
rolls enjoy a degree of popularity in hotel seryice 
ayeraging about three to fiye They are more diffi- 
cult to ma'ie— orat least to bake— and a fine graham 
roll is not to be met with eyerywhere. They don' t 
all know how to make them as nice as these.

1 egg — 2 whites are better. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Set sponge with the graham at 9 or 10 in tha 
morning, for rolls for supper; at about 1 add all the 
other ingredients and make it stiff dough. Let rise 
till 4. Then work the dough bj spreading it out 
on the table, with the knuckles, folding oyer and 
pressing again repeatedly. Make into rolls in any 
of the ways to be hereinafter detailed for whi^« 
rolls. Grease slightly between eacn one witn a 
brush dipped in melted lard or butter. Brush oyer 
the tops with the same, and set the rolls to rist

Such is the force of habit or custom, one must not 
expect to be accounted the best breadmaker in the 
world if our graham and brown breads be not brown, 
and our giogei bread be not <'old-fuhioned," that 
is dark colored. Graham rolls are expected to be 
light-brown in color. They don't look natural 
otherwise; they are nicer so and not so likely to be 
taken for second-rate French rolls. But now that 
the march of ciTilizition has taken away our old- 
fashioned black molasses and given us colorless 
Illinois sorghum syrup instead, It is hard to see what 
else we can do but use a spoonftil of burnt sugar 
caramel for coloring, else our brown breads cannot 
possibly be brown. 



The trifle of sweetening called for in graham 
rolls makes the crust thin and soft. 

It is ttT better to set the sponge with the graham 
80 atf to soak and soften the bran, instead of taking 
up white bread sponge and working stiff with gra- 
ham, as is oftenest done '*for ehort." Best bread- 
makers in the world use themseWes to the right 
ways flrom the first. 



Pastrycooks do not and need not measure the 
flour. They measure the three-fourtbs water and 
one-fourth yeast, and add all the flour needed to 
make dougb. A cup, or half pint of fluid wets a 
pound of flour. 



It is immaterial whether the dough be made by 
setting sponge, or batter with yeast in it, as pre- 
▼iouiily directed, or all the ingredients put in a pan 
and mixed up at once. At night the latter way has 
to be adopted. The dough made by the receipt for 
grabam rolls over night can bi used ptvrt for loaves 
and part for muffins by the following short and easy 
method.

Graham Muffins. 



Makes about thirty. 

2 pounds of graham roll dough. 

2 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces (a bastingspoonful) of molasses. 

i cupfbl of milk. 



2 whole eggs and 2 yolks. 

Take tbe dough that has been already prepared 
for malting rolls. Warm it and the butter in a pan 
together. Put in the otber ingredients and beat all 
together about 6 minutes. Qrease tin muffin rings 
or gem pans. Hslf fill them. Rise half an hour. 
Bake 10 minutes. Brush over with butter or hot 
water. But if you have no light dough made the 
muffins can be set ftrom the beginning with : 

I pound graham; } pound white flour; } pint 
milk; I cup yeast; salt, molasses eggs, butUr, as in 
foregoing receipt. Mix and let rise 4 hours. Beat 
6 minutes, rise in rings till igbt, then bake. 

Many of the people in poor health who ft^quent 
the springs and pleasure places for recuperation are 
extremely critical in the matter of such hygienic 
articles of diet as graham rolls and gems, and all 
tbe hints here given will be found useful in the en^ 
deavor to meet their requirements.

THB AMBBIOAN PASTBT COOK. 



Ad hotel pa^irj cook and baVer who had grown 
ashamed of himself, once told me that for years he 
went from one hotel to another, as pastry cooks do, 
and always finding the people earnestly wished for 
Boston Brown Bread, he as earnestly protested that 
it could not be made unless there was a brick oven 
in which to bake it 8 hourr, and as only about one 
in fiAy of American hotels own a brick oven this 
usually ended the argument. 

And yet here and there would be some little house 
enjoying quite a reputation and a run of custom be 
cause of its much beloved Boston brown, or it might 
be only rye-and-injuo, hot for break&st or supper, 
or for Sunday mornings especially. No matter how, 
but as he grew wiser and older this pastry cook 
found the brick OTen was by no means an article 
indispensable, and Boston brown that was a thous- 
and times pronounced a*l that could be wished, he 
made by the following described methods. 

522. Boston Brown Bread. 
Raised with Yeast. 



1 quart of corn meal. 
1 quart of graham. 
1 quart rye flour. 
1 quart white flour. 
1 quart of boi'iog water. 
1 pint of yeast. 

1 small cup of molasses. 

2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 

} cup of burnt sugar coloring. 

The method here recommended is materially 
different ftrom the common troublesome process; 
first, because troublesome processes cannot and will 
not be carried out in hitels duin^ good business 
and secondly, because this way produces as good 
results as if one sat up all night about it. 

Scald the meal by i' self first, by pouring the boil- 
ing water on and stirring in a pan. Then add mo- 
lasses, saU, caramel. If still hot, let it stand awhile 
before adding anything else. Yihen only milk 
warm strain in the yeast, then mix in the graham 
and rye and the white fi /ur last. The dough will be 
like graham dough and ctin be worked on the table. 
Part of the white flour should be left oyer to dust 
with. After a little kneading, slightly grease the 
pan it was mixed in, place the dcugh in it, cover 
with a cloth and let rise moderately warm about 6 
hours. Turn on the table, knead a little, make into 
4 or 5 loaves, place in round moulds or pails, let rise 
about half an hour or an hour if to be baked instead 
of steamed. 

By this method no sponge is set, but the dough is 
mixed up stiff at once — care being taken not to let 
the yeast get rcalded in the hot meO — greatly lessen- 
ing the trouble. If commenced in the middle of the 
day the loaves will be ready for the oven after the 



rolls at night, and should be baked two or three 
hours at very moderate heat. Or, mixed at night 
and made into loaves very early the bread may be 
baked in time for breakfast. But the best way is 
this: 

Hake up the dough as directed, at 7 in the morn- 
ing. Work and make into loaves at 12 or 1. After 
rising one-half hour set the iron pails containing the 
loaves in the steam-chest, or in a boiler with water, 
and steam in this way till 5 80. Then bake one-h^lt 
hour and serve hot for supper, the remainder 
answering for cold bread to toast. 



When these loaves become hollow in the top it is 
because of too much rising or proof in the pails. 
Steaming does not arrest fermentation quicx enough 
and they get too light and fall. 

The foregoing is one way that requires good 
yeast. The next is shorter still and fakes baking 
powder instead. It is hard to sa^ which is the 
better. You can be happy with either. 



H^S. Steamed Brown Bread. 

Made with Bakin^r Powder. 

2 pounds of corn meal. 

1 quart of boiling water. 

1 cupfUl of dark molasses. 

1 pint of coid milk or water. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

6 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

1 pound of graham. 

I pound of white flour. 

Scald the meal with the boiling water. Add the 
mo'assesand then rest of the ingredients — the powder 
being mixed in the flour. Beat up thoroughly. It 
makes soft dough. Put it in 2 or 8 iron pails having 
lids and steam 6 hours or more, then bake about 
20 minutes. 



Hotel providers who would have brown bread by 
these easy methods always, need to provide a set of 
pails that will stand baking, having bales and lids. 
They should last for years and require to be made of 
the be-t Russia iron, as these properly c«red for, 
greased while hot and wiped out, never discolor the 
bread. 6 inches across, 8 inches deep.

Bye and Indian. 



No different method is needed but to change the 
ingredients of Boston Brown so as to leave out ttae 
grah'im and the flour and double the proportions 
of meal and rye in their place. 



Bakers' rye loaves are made by the same method 
as French lonves, and will be found in that oonneo- 
tion at a subsequent page.

The Best Wliite Bread suid How 
to Make it. 



525. 

Archesiraius, a friend of one of Pericles* sons; 
* * this great writer, dunng his trayels. did noi 
make inquiriug into the ujanners of nations, since 
they always I eoiain the eamo, but going into the 
laboratories where the de ioacies of the table are 
prepared, he only held intercourse with those who 
could advaLoe his pleasares. — Philosophieal Hiatory 
of Cookery. 

The ardent dietetic morality which extolled tbe 
bread that was coarsest, brownest, stalest and most 
truly home-mide, and caused fine white and fresh 
bread to be swallowed as if it were a sin against 
nature, is classed among the <*Isms of forty years 
ago'* in one of the January magazines. Dr. Syl- 
Yester Qraham of Connecticut, started the reform, 
which, running to great lengths at first, has result- 
ed, in the long run, in a happy mean, a modific - 
tion, a d greater variety in the popular bill of fhre. 
The people in great numbers, who find the white rolls 
and bread irresistible may reap satisfaction from 
finding so eminent an authority as the author of 
''Gastronomy** in their favor. His prescnption, the 
groundwork of his care for thinness, for "a young 
sylph, or other airy creature, who wishes to assume 
a more material form** is **first of all, maKe it a gen- 
eral rule to eat nothing but newly.baked bread, e»- 
peo a>ly the crumb, and plenty of it." And he had 
studit d such matters all his life. But as there are 
dinners and dinners, — so Cardinal Richelieu re- 
marks to his mi^jor domo, meaning that some are very 
bad,— so it st*ould be said about bread. The rolls 
of Limet, of Rue de Richelieu, could noi hurt any- 
body. 

520. 

On one occasion the writer wag called upon as a 

probably competent judge to pass opinion on the 
work of one of the reputed very best bread makers. 
There is a dubious kind of excellence in this line as 
in eyeryihiog else that does not feel able to stand 
alone but alwajs wants somebody to keep saying it 
excels. 8uch was tbe case here. The bread was 
extremely'fine, yet, I venture to say the people did 
not enjoy it except to look at, and felt that some 
esbciiti^l quality wa-< lacking. It was white as 
chalk and a g >od deal like it ; fine-grained as deli- 
cate cake, but had no toughness nor elasiciiy and 
crumbled when broken, like meal. It had a sweet- 
ish insipidity of taste, instead of the hearty relish- 
ing wheal flavor tf good bread. It was made so by 
an immense amount of kneading the wrong way. 

These people did not invite instruction nor criti- 
cism, only praise. I said tbe bread was superNtively 
fine, and tbe >ady was one of the best breadmakers 
in tbe world. That the bread was not good was a 
mental re*ervatijn. We all frequently make bread 
that is fine but not good, and they that have such 
for their regular diet sometimes find in a loaf of 



common bakeis* bread a new revelation of how 
swee the taste of bread can b^*, and wonder whence 
springs the difference. It is not what the bakers 
put in the bread but the proper method of working 

Just the other day a magazinist spoke of good 
bread making as a lost art. A figure of speech, 
perhaps, or else the opinion of a lover of good bread 
whose experiences have been bad ; but if there be 
any grounds for such an idea to rest on the cause 
may be found in the unwillingness of instructors in 
cookery to property dwell upon so seemingly simple 
and self-evident a matter as the proper way oi 
kneading dough. And very recently another inti- 
mated how many persons accustomed to *< biscuit 
streaked with saleratusand heavy with lard, regard 
rolls white and light as newly-fallen snow as some- 
thing belonging to tbe households of princes, to the 
King of France's Kitchen, but not to be freely eaten 
by common folks.'* Now it is cheaper to have good 
bread than bad, and the bare formula for making it 
being so little and the understanding how so much, 
we are going to do our best to endeavor to draw atten 
tion to what the knack of making bread both good and 
fine consisti in — ^yeatt and flour being good to begin 
with. 



It took one, otherwise excellent, pastry cook ten 
years to discover this knack for himself, but he was 
all tbe while the worst mystified man imaginable, 
because he had, when a boy, made rolls that people 
would eat in preference to anything else, while now 
every other kind of breid was preferred to his hand- 
somest ro I Is The faul t with them was the same as with 
the lady's fine, brittle and tasteless bread already 
spoken of. 

This man had been shown how to work in n 
routine way in a large bakery without ever being 
impressed with any idea of the particular way being 
essential to good quality, and when, atterwards, in 
a French kitchen where ornamentation was run to 
the extreme at the expense often of good flavor, he 
exercised his ingenuity till he could make rolls in 
forty different fancy shapes, he found, lifter all, they 
were in little demmd. He worked all the life out 
of the dough in making it into curliques. Then in 
a busy time a very common fellow came along and 
was set to make the rolls. He was too common even 
to have a name except a familiar Tom, Dicir, or 
Harry and was quite unconci ^us that the rolls he 
made were the firht that had ever been eaten with a 
real zest and favored with a constantly io creasing 
demand in that house. But after that the fancy 
breads were neglected and there was less cry for 
toast. Even the "help** — excellent judges of what 
is good, although discretely silent — would steal tbe 
new man's rolls out of tbe corners of the pans as 
they passed ~a thing never known to be done be- 
fore, as long as a biscnit cou3d be had. 



13\/ 



THB AMEBIOAK PASTRY COOK. 



Aod all the differcnoe wu in two different ways 
of working the s<ime materiftls The superiority of 
the common fellow's rolls and bread was all owing 
to his kneading the dough the right way. 



ai^t. Common Bread Douffh. 

As a rule use one-fourth yeast to three*fourths 
water. 

The good potato yeast with no germs of sourness 
in it, such as we haye already directed how to 
make, does no harm in still larger proportions whe a 
jhe weather is cold or time of mixing late. But 
the whitest bread is made when the dough can haye 
long time to rise, not hurried up. 

1 pint of yeasC. 

8 pints of warm water. 

1 heaping tablespoonAil of salt 

8 pounds of flour. 

Makes 8 loayes of conyenient dse. 



528. Settdnff Sponge. 

Strain the yeast and water into a pan and mix 
in half the flour. Beat the batt^ thus made 
thoroughly. Scrape down the sides of the pan. 
Pour a spoonful of melted lard on top and spread 
it with the baok of the fingers. This is to prevent 
a crust forming on top. Coyer with a cloth and set 
the sponge in a moderately warm place to rise 4 or 
6 hours. 



520. Making up the Dough. 



The vpooge baring been set at 8 in the morning, 
beat it again about une, add the salt and make up 
stiff dough with the rest of the flour. Knead the 
dough on the table, alteruately drawing it up in 
round shape and pressing the pulled-o?er edges 
into the middle and ihen pressing it out to a flat 
sheet, foldiogoyer and pressing out again. 

Brush the clean scraped pan oyer with the least 
touch of melted lard or butter — which prevents 
Slicking and waste of doughs place the dough in 
and brush that over, tjo. Where economy reigos 
the stricteni a Utile warm water in a cup, and tva- 
spoooful of lard melted in it will do for this brush* 
iug oyer and insures toe tiuest Raving and smooth- 
est bread. Let the dough rise till 4. 



530. 



The Important Ten Minutes Kneading 



A i about 4 o'clock spread the dough on the table 
by pressing out with the knuckles till it is a thin 
uneven sheet Double it over on itself and press 
the two edges together all around first. This 
imprisons air in the knuckle holes in large masses. 
Then pound and press the dough with the fists till 
it h IS become a thin sheet again, with the inclosed 



air distribute 1 in bubbles all through it. Fold < 
and repeat this process sever 1 1 times Then roll It 
up. It will be 

UKB AM AIR CUSHION. 

Let it stand a few minutes before making into 
plain rolls, cleft rolls, or loaves. 



Making Dough at Night. 



It would be a great hardship and in most 
impracticable to make the night dough by the 
sponge method, although the shop bakerd do so, and 
work it in the middle of the night. Quite as good 
bread oan be made by mixing up into stiff dough at 
first, provided proper precautions be observed. 
The danger is of too much fermentation, the dough 
being ready to bake hours before the time When 
a sponge is set the fresh flour added to it hours after 
checks fermentation, but when all the flour is wet- 
ted atoDce, there is no check except the coolness of 
night keeps it back. In summer the dough may 
be mixed up wiih ice w^ter instead of warm, at any 
time after supper and fermentation will not begin 
for some time after, while the flour is becoming 
whiter all the time for being so long in the dough 
state. 



How Muoh E^neading. 

Small quantities of dough can be easily injured by 
too much kneading. The true plan is to keep kneading 
till its India rubber-like toughness causes it to begin 
to break instead of spread out. Then stop and let 
it lose itd springiness beforekneadiag again. 

581. Premium Family Bread. 



To have bread superlatively white and floe grain- 
ed and good besides, put the dough through the 
preceding described Jcneadiog process three or four 
times half ai hour apart. The dough made U3 stiff 
over night should be kneaded at 4 in the morning 
and again an hour after, in order to make good rolls 
for breakfdsi This helps to make up for the loss of 
the thorough heatiogs of the sponge when the sponge 
method is practiced. 



532, Ckx>kB and Bakers. 



"Why, good heavens ! we have lost our way. But 
what a delightful smell there is here of hot bread, 
Andree.'* 

"That is by no means surprising," replied the 
other, "for we are close to the door of a baker's 
shop." — Dumas, 

Anciently, — we read in Roman antiquities — the 
cook and baker were one. In the hotel work of the 
pre!>ent the same rule holds. This little book recog- 
nizes a distioction between the hotel baker or pastry- 
cook and the shop baker. The latter seldom does 
well when he tries hotel work. The hotel pastry- 



THB AMEBIOAN PA8TB7 OOOK, 



131 



Mok goii g into a bakery geoeially makes the goods 
richer than shop rules and profits will allow. This 
book up plying to hotel WAys pursues a new path and 
Is necessarily a little at rariance with baker's 
methods. If it were a baker's routine we should 
haye to describe three bucket sponges or ten buc'iet 
sponges; and when the baker makes up his dough 
he adds to his three bucket sponge about as much 
more warm water 

This plan of adding mire liquid to the sponge is 
commendable for checking too rapid fermentation 
— best way when loaf bread only is to be made, but 
not for rolls or fancy breads The bakers' ways 
are referred to for illustrations for comparison 
chiefly. 

The essential points in bread making are the same 
whether in shops, hotel kitchens, or private houses. 
When to the baker's proper ways of wor ing, we in 
hotels add the small amount of enriching ingre- 
dients which they do not need and cannot afford in 
their larger operations, we produce the extra fine 
rolls a d extra bread, baring which people think 
they can almost dispense with eyerjthing else. 



The lump of dough already prepared, smooth and 
like an air cushion, lies in layers or flakes, and it 
is another part of the art of good bread making not 
to disturb them much in making up. It might be 
hard to explain why this stringy texture preserved 
in the loayes sbouli make a difference in the taste, 
but it is plain it does, and in this lies the defiirable^ 
ness of whatare known as French loaves. 

5dd. Baker's Oleft Bolls. 
Petlts Pains. 



Take a portion of the dough flat as it lies and 
without working it at all, spread it with hands find 
rollicg-pin to a sheet less than an inch thick. Cut 
this into 2^ inch squares. Take two opposite cor- 
ners and press them into the middle, making long 
cushion shapes with pointed ends. Place them 
smooth side up on bulking pans with plenty of room 
between. Brush over with water. Let rise nearly 
an hour. Just before putting in the oven cut them 
lengthwise with a down stroke so as to nearly diride 
the two halves. Bake in a hot oven about ten 
minutes. 



584, Baker's Frenoh Loaves. 

The same as the preceding, of larger size. Gut 
the entire piece of dough in about 10 pieces. Flat^ 
ten out without kneading Bring two opposite cor- 
ners together and press them into the middle and 
press the loaf sides together in long, pointed shape. 
Then there are two ways of proceeding. 



1. Place each loaf with the smouth side down in 
a flowered napkin or piece of clean flour s ck and 
set tbem to rise an hour that way, in a deep pan or 
box just touching. The oven being ready, turn the 
leaf right side up on to the peel, cut it lengthwise 
down nearly to the bottom, and sbp it to its place 
on the oven bottom. 

2. The itbove plan not being conveaient to prac- 
tice, make the loaves as before and place them rigl t 
side up in the usual hotel baking pans, brush over 
with water, rise, cut as before, and bakeia the pans. 
There should be plenty of room between. Brush 
with water again when done. 



The bakers pursue a method so laboiious in mak- 
ing their flaky, stringy Fieoch loaves as would for- 
ever deter weakly people from trjiug, if it were the 
only way. But in this c>ise kuow.edge u liicrally 
power The dough carefully kneaded on the table 
in the way that has been directed reaches the same 
condition as if it had been worked in a trough with 
water with an immense expenditure of strength. 



535. 



Hotel Loaves. 



The crusty cleft loaves not being suitable to slice 
foi* the table, nor for toast, we make of the same 
dough slightly worked, a better sort. Cut the 
dough in eight pieces and moutd them up round, 
but not enough to destroy the texture— only from 6 
to 12 turns. Let stand on the table a few minutes. 
Press them out like dinner plates. Bring over two 
opposite edges and press them into the middle and 
place the long loaves side by side in the pans. 



To Prevent Splittinff at the Bnds. 



It is curious to obrerve that the simple way of 
folding the loaf just described prevents splitting 
open at the ends in baking, while one more folding 
in of the other two sides has often the opposite effect 
and causes much waste of bread that cannot be 
sliced. 



It makes a thin crust to bread and the loaves to 
part clean and even if they are brushed over with a 
touch of melted lard when placed in the pans. 



53e. 



Plain Bolls. 



Mouid the doygh into little rouod balls and place 
tbem ju-t touching in the pano, slightly greased be- 
tween. Rise an hour; baV e 20 minutes; brush over 
with water when done. Keep hot without drying 
out or sweating the bottom on the iron pan. 



We shall come to the more delicate sorts of roUf 
further on.

Baker's Milk Bread. 



Make up the spooge and dough for this the same 
as for oommoa bread, but use sweet milk insteid of 
water. Its merit is its whiteoess, fine grain, and 
sweetness of taste like French rolls. There are three 
essential points to be observed. 

1. Beat the sponge and dough extremely well, 
only adding the flour gradua I7 and beating it in. 

2. Hare the dough as soft as it is possible to knead 
it well, too ^ oft to keep good shape as loayes apart, 
and bake the loayes in tin moulds. 

3. Put it in to bake after the rolls oome out. As 
it must be of light color outside and browns too 
easily it can only have a slack oven to bake in 
Brush OTcr the loaves with milk when done. 



588. 



Rye Bread. 



The proper method with rye bread is the same as 
with French loaves, *hat is, the dough is to be work- 
ed in layers and nothing added but salt to the ye«8t 
and water ; the dough made up rather stiff to keep 
good shape, and when the loaves are put in . the 
oven, instead of a long downward out merely score 
the rye loaves across diagonally three or four ti^es. 

But for hotel use, where there is no brick oven, 
it does as wed or better to make long loaves in pans 
as already directed for ordinary hotel bread.

kinds of "sweet cakes," in a continuous line from

safely say tbat there was a row of ten or a dozen

ened breads and good ginger bread seem to be more 
acceptable in the ordinary hotel where the *<balance

richer sorts yet to come.

German Baker's OoSee Oake. 

4 pounds of light bread dough. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter or lard. 

1 egg ( Not essential . ) 

Take the dough at noon and mix in the ingredU 
ents all slightly wi^rm Knead it on the table with 
flour sufficient. Set to rise until 4 o'clock. Knead 
it agsin by npreading it out on the table with the 
knuckles, foldin/ over and repeating Roll it.out to 
sheets scarcely thicker than a pencil, place on bak. 
ing pans, brush over with either water or melted 
lard, or milk. Rise about an hour. Score the cakes 
with a knife point as you put them in the oven to 
prevent the crust pufflng up. Bake about 15 min- 
utes. 

One of the attractions of this plain oake is the 
powdered cinnamon and sugar sified on top after 
baking, the cake being first brushed with sugar and 
water. Cut in squares and serve hot 

The foregoing makes a sheet of oake large enough 
tocover astove top.

Pio-Nio Bread. 



Another form of the coffee cake, cheap and good 
for school pic-nics and the like, and for sale. 

Mix a few ra'sins or currants in the German coffee 
cake dough. Roll out pieces to the size ,of dessert 
pfates and half inch thick, brush over with a little 
melted lard, double them over like large split rolls. 
Kipe and bake like bread, and brush over with a 
mixture of water, egg, and sugar. 



Currant Buns —Chelsea Buns. 
542. "Washinston Buns. 



Hot for supper. No eggs required. Favorite 
sort and quickly made. This makes 45. 

4 pounds of light bread dough. 

8 ounces of currants. 

8 ounces of softened butter. 

8 ounces of sugar 

It is soon enough to begin these 2 hours before 
supper. Take the dough from the rolls at say 4 
o'clock. Spread it out, strew the currants over and 
knead them in Roll out the dough to \ inch sheet.

other ingi edients. Let stand an hour, then knead 
thoroughly At 4 o'clock knead again, mou!d iut > 
round balls, grease between each one as you place 
them in the pans. Rise an hour, bake 20 minut«s. 
Placed close together in the pans they are the ordi-

are round flat buos; may be sugared on top and have 
ourrants or carraway seeds mixed in the dough.

Little cinnamon, or other spice. 

Flour to work up to soft dough. 

An egg or two does not hurt it. Make up by the 
coffee cake directions. Dredge granulated sugar 
over the top when done. Good for supper, hot. 



Speaking of gingerbread, howeyer, the next, 
although not made with bread dough, is the best sort 
yet discovered for hotel suppers. Gingerbread is 
inclined to be tricky and uncertain, or more proper, 
ly speaking, sticky and uneatable, if not made wi'h 
care. ^ Too much molasses or too much soda or 
powder are usually the faults. This can be made 
with buttermilk and sod'i if desired.

Spread a thin coating of butter on the baking pans, 
let it get quite cold and set, then spread the paste 
on it no thicker than a yisiting card, barely coyer^

A.n Inquiry into their Origin. 




Dishes worthy of special attention had Mieir name 
and quality ceremoniously proclaimed. — PhUosophi- 
cal fluiory of Cookery 

An uncommon dish was introduced to the sound 
of the flute, and the servants were crowned with 
flowers. In the time of supper the guests were en- 
tertained with mufic and dancing, « • • 
but the more sober bad only persons to read or re- 
peat select passages from books — Roman Antiquities 

The kinds of rolls shown in the cut, which are un- 
derstood to be par excellence French rolls, are of chief- 
est interest to us in hotels, for the two reasons that 
•rerybody likes them — most potent consideration 



where the aim and end of all endeayor is to pl cao e 
and that they, at least, appear to I* ) of Amerieas 
origin. 

1 snid as much once to an old and educated Ital- 
ian cook who had been a great trayeler, but he smil- 
ed: — '* America is too young to haye any cookery of 
her own ; yon can find a foreign origin for CTcry 
dish you have I remember seeing such rolls as 
those on the tables at restaurants and eafie in Eu- 
rope, when a boy, over fifty years ago " Yet at 
last this wa9 but a conjecture He could not be surt 
that what he saw were not the baker's cleft rolls 
mentioned some pages back, and which haye no 
greit merit oyer ordinary baker's bread. One of 
the best American domestic cok-books also men- 
tions <*the cleft rolls which we so often find on the 
tables or the city restaurants" And we still re- 
main in ignorance, eyen if they proye the same, 
whether they may not liaye been presented by 
America to Europe at first. The name. French roll, 
may be but an American application, as if it had 
been taken for granted that whateyer is admirable 
in cookery must be French. It is the popular under- 
standing of a split roll or pocket-book shape that can 
be pulled open hot, and admits a lump of butter 
within its melting clasp, but neyer so fkr as I can 
find out has been described in any but American 
book sand those domestic 

The earliest dated mention of French rolls I liaye 
met w*th in the merely cursory search which such a 
miaor matter justifies, is the following, recently 
republished in the Ripoetbe from "Forney's Pro- 
gress" : 

♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ " A public resort known as Spring 
Garden. The hotel attached to the premises was 
situated on the late site of the Museum, at the cor* 
uer of Ann street, (New York) In 1760 1 find the 
adyertisementof John Elkin, its proprietor, offering 
to the public, 'breakfast from 7 to 9 ; tea in the 
afternoon from 3 to 6 ; the best of green tea and hoi 
FVench roUt, pies and tarts drawn from 7 to 9 ; 
mead and cakes.' " 

This shows that French rolls were «the thing" at 
a date eyen anterior to the culminatiog period of 
modem French cookery, before the reyolution. 

But the French rolls of that adyertisement ; of 
the quotation from Sayarin at the opening of this 
book, of the quotation from Bulwer at the head of 
the next diyision — the French rolls of the tradeo- 
people who buy them hot for breakfast of the bakers 
in all the European towns are only little round 
loayes— crowded into the pans so that they rise to a 
tall shape, and taken from the oyen at interyals, 
kept smoking hot under green baise coyers — made 
a trifle richer than ordinary bakers' bread. The 
split roll shown in the picture is in all likelihood an 
American improyement 

In <'Quentin Duriyard" (chap, it) 8ir ll?alter 
Scott giy<*s the most explicit information in this re-

gard. At the breakfast — "There wai a delicate 
lagoaty with just thai petit point de V ail which Gas- 
eons loye and Scottishmen do not hate. There was 
the most exquisite white bread, made into little 
round loaves callei boulet, (whence the bakers took 
their French name Boulangers) of which the crust 
was so invitiog thai, even with water alone it would 
haye been a delicacy. But the water was not 
a'one *' 

The probability that split rolls are an American 
improyement is strengthened by the apparant ab- 
sence of any mention of tbem in the best foreign 
cojB books. Seeing how suitable the shape shown 
in the out is for saodwiches one would have expect- 
ed Jules Gouffe (about 1860) to adopt it instead of 
this circumstantial direction for *'rolls with foie- 
gras ;" he says, "Ta^^e 24 small French rolls of an 
o?al shape, 2} ioches by 1 J, rasp the rolls and s'it 
them open lenj^thwise withomt separating them ea- 
tirely." The Cuttiiu CUutiqw directs much the 
same way, to cut off the tops of roll and brioche, 
(sort of butter rolls) and remove the inside crumb, 
for sandwiches and timbales. So also the "Modern 
Cook," (1840) and, later, -Model Cookery,*' which 
only directs to make French rolls in loog shapes 
placed side by side. A number of lesser works 
either ignoie French rolls a together or treat the 
makiog up in round balls as a matter of course. 

On the contrary, the writer of these lines worked 
with a man, A. Nelson by name, making both the 
shapes shown, as far back a 1850, on one of the old. 
time, high*living floating palaces of New Orleans, 
and found them then as ever since the most popular 
of all. The man's home was at Nashville, Tenn. 
Judging from his age and experience and his un- 
conciousnois of there being any novelty in this sort 
of rolls it eeems fair to assume that he had been used 
to tbem for ten or fifteen years before. Some four 
or five years after I saw the same in Cincinnati and 
Evansviile, under the name of Parker House rolls 
bince then in numerous American publications they 
may be found ca led by those and other names — 
Tremont House rolls for one. 

Mr. Charles Wood, for an ordinary lifetime baker 
at the Tremont House, Boston, drawn out in reply 
to a newspaper paragraph crediting him with the 
origination of /V«ncA rolls in this country — mean- 
ing the split rolls shown in the cut— ojily dates back 
the making of his pattern about twentj-six years', 
and explains that Mr. Paran Stevens required him 
to make rolls like some he had seen on a European tour 
Mr. Wood does not in his published let ter say that the 
rolls he produced were the sime as the European, 
but only that after several months trial he produce t 
what satisfied Mr. Paran Stevens — who may still 
have had in mind the French brioche, or even the 



o^efl rolls whose texture is in flakes and ooils, tad 
their merit being individual loaves. 



It appears that the general hotel and traveler's 
understanding of the term is by no means univer- 
sal. Let us make rolls French, according to th«r 
European understanding, and never so good, if they 
be round, tall, oval, oblong or twisted, some person 
will send them back, and looking at the bill-of fare 
will say bring him some Drench rolls. And another 
great lover of bread will say, "these are all very 
well, but you ought to see the French rolls they 
have at — " some other house. Nevertheless a letter 
from Russia published *n the Rbpobter two years 
ago remarked how much better the de icate soft roils 
there were "than the French, which are nearly all 
crust.'- 

These Russian rolls were doubtless the same as our 
'^French." Puzzled by these diverse ideas I 
wrote to the Royal Baking Powder Co., who had ex- 
hibited the making of "Vienna Rolls" with powder 
at the Centennial, in Philadelphia, and the pres- 
dent kindly answered with drawings showing for 
French rolls, the cleft crusty loaves of the bakers — 
directions for making which bave alieady been given 
at length — and their Vienna rolls were in shape 
like those, plain ones, in our picture. There is a 
remark in one of the higher-class cook-books recent- 
ly published, that hot biends for breakfast and sup- 
per are but little used except in the West. Accord- 
ingly our hotel French rolls are no* described in it at 
all. And yet the Parker and Tremont Houses are 
in the East, and Boston people every vv here are exhib- 
iting their rolls to the heathen with pride. Are those 
Bos* on hotels to be regarded as deriving much of their 
fume firom the introduction of this peculiar invtitu- 
tioa where before it was unknown? As an example 
of how a thing n ay ha'> e various names in differ- 
ent loc •lities : Last year a ('aaadian hotel steward 
who went West and conducted a first-class house, 
well knew the merit* and importance of fine rolls, 
yet BO Utile acquainted with their rsual name that 
he had them printed on his bill-of-fare "buns." So 
without really appearing on the bill at all, the s lit 
ro h experienced an increasing demand firom three 
or four hundred to over eight hundred at a meal, 
and so it went till abo ^t the time the third batch of 
supper and breakfast bills were to De printed, when 
the pastrycook ventured to intimate that "buns" 
were very rarely called for, but the "no names"-^ 
the French rolls which did not appear at all upon the 
bill were having a tremendous run all the same. Then 
the name was printed right. It is not to be inferred 
that the hotel steward was ignorant, but only that 
these rolls were not familiarly known in the section 
whence he cam4. 

Perhaps nine out of ten of the people outside the 
circulatiug intelligence of our hute s, if ask'd the

meaning of the term "poo\et-book roll/' would 
guess it to mean a roll of five and ten dollar bills — 
sometimes called greenbacks, and sometimes Spin, 
nerisms. U is no such thing, but a roll ju«t like 
those in our cut, It is a local domestic name for 
the hotel French roll. A Western author, Miss Far- 
man, of Michigan, so descr'bes it and the method 
of making, in the ^'Cooking Club of Tuwh t Hol- 
low," in the children's Wide Awake, and speaks as 
if the appellation were one well known and under 
stood among home folk, althou,^h 'so strange to our 
hotel bill-of-fare. However, it mu^t be owned, our 
rolls are the more like a pocket-book, (with s.lk or 
satin covers) the better I hey are made; for there is more 
sense in having a somewhat flat shape, not too thick 
for a bite, than the taller form that is neither loaf 
nor slice 

Through all the foregoing, and many other con- 
siderations too tedious to mention, I haye arrived 
at the nipposttioru that French rolls, as understood 
by commercial travelers and other hotel frequenters, 
are of American origin; that they were evolved out 
of the competition between Boston hotels ; that 
they were first a specialty of the Parker House, 
that thence they spread rapidly to wherever there 
was good living, because the travelling people went 
braggiog about them, and that they have found their 
way like pilgrims and strangers into the domestic 
world, contentedly ta** ing any pet name that may 
have been thrust upon them. All of which is re- 
spectfully submitted. 

550. 

However that may prove to be, I would advise that 

rolls of any other shape be denomioMted oq the bill- 
offare simply hot rolls, and the term French roll, 
in American hotels, should always be understood to 
mean a split roll like these sh^wn.

Perhaps we, behind the scenes in hotels, take 
different views of what is important, from the ma- 
jority of people. With the matter in hand, for 
instance. Individuals, or a family, may never even 
see ft hot roll on their table, and ye never realize 
how unfortunate they are. The <'sour grapes'' phi- 
losophy m^y help them, and they believe hot rolls 
are not wholesome, anyway. It is really of no con- 
sequence in isolated cases. But when a whole hotel 
full of people show a decided liking for rolls, so (hat 
they could not well enjoy a meal without, does not 
the increased size of the matter justify our case? 
There are lean times, too, in hotels, when the meat 
is poor, game out of market and spring lajnb not 
come in ; when poultry almost disappears and 
oysters are no more ; neither choice vegetables nor 
new fruits have arrived. Then the regulars grow 
discontented and seek new pasture— at the restau- 
rants where sliced baker's bread is set before them 
— at the opposition hotel where, whatever else they 
may try to have, the rolls are unwholesome wads of 
dough, or dry and unpalateable biscuits and grimy 
cakes. Then the regulars return to their pr per 
homes like good boys, and say it is all very well 
over there, but they don't have good rolls— and 
w th such rolls as these they can almost dispense with 
everything else. In such c<ises may not the pastry- 
cook claim a right to loom up tall and exalt his 
trade?

2 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of lard or butter. 

4 pounds of flour 

Set sponge at 8 in the morning with half the flour.

All the detailed instructions for making the dough 
and kneading it the right way have been given 
already under the head of common bread. 

Afier the 4 o'clock kneading proceed to make the 
dough into rolls. 

Persons in practice find it quickest to pull off 
pieces of dough of right size and mould them up 
instantly. 

1. Others cut off strips of dough, roll them in 
lengths and cut these up in roll sizes. 

2. Mould them up round with no flour on the 
board and only a dust on the hands, and place them

3. Take a little rolling pin — ^it looks like a piece

the middle of each, as in (he cut. 

4. Brush these over with the least possible melt- 
e 1 lard or batter, using a tin-bonnd TamiBh bmsh 
for tha purpose. 

6. I>ouble the rolls, the two buttered sides to- 
gether as seen in the out below, and ptaee them in 
the pans diagonally, with plenty of room so they 
will not touch 




6. Brush oyer the tops of the rolls in the pans 
with the least possible melted lard again and set tl>em 
to rise about an hour — ^less or more according to 
temperature. 

7. Bake in a hot OTen, about 10 minutes. Brush 
oyer with clear water when done. 

Keep baking at short intenrala and keep hot with- 
out drying out 



The particular feature of these rolls, it is seen, is 
the folded shape, allowing them to be opened when 
done, and this is the result ofbrushing oyer with but-

The preceding receipt producing fine French rolls, 
good enough for anything, the next are no-names. 
The addition of eggs and butter does not make a yast 
difference, but still makes them creamy colored and 
crisp. 

And if a body choose to name either of the two 
for some fayorite hotel, need any other body kick? 
Possibly their name ma/ be Parker, Tremont, Re- 
yere, Brunswick, French, Chrendon, St James o'

they are?

1 ounce of salt. 

All the flour it will take up^or about 6 pounds. 

A larger proportion of yeast may be used in winter 
The dough ought not to want coaxing under a 
stoye to rise. Our yeast made from good stock 
brings the dough up fast enough anywhere in a 
warm room, and bread thus easily raised is alw ys 
the best and sweetest. Half yeast to half milk or 
water is better than too little. 



If these pocket-book shaped rolls are such general 
fayorites, why are they not uniyersally adopted and 
found eyerywhere? The directions a little way 
back numbered 1 to 7 explain the reason why. 

These rolls are yery tedious to make and take 
up one person's time from all other kinds of bread. 
When business is dull the pastrycook makes them in 
great perfection for the few people, but as soon as 
the house begins to fill up the work begins to 
crowd and the tedious split rolls are discon* 
tinned just at the time when they are really 
needed and would do most good. The reme- 
dies are, to leaye out the unimportant kinds and 
giye the time to these, and where it is impossible to 
giye these rolls the 5 or G handliogs, ra'her than 
abandon, cut them out instead. To do this, roll (he 
dough to a sheet as if for b'scuit. Brush oyer with 
melted lard. Cut cut and double oyer. French 
rolls made without yolk of egg will cnme out the 
smoothest-looking when baked, if made that way.

Finest Hotel Bread. 



Sometimes called Vienna bread, and French bread. 

Make the dough by the receipt fur French split 
rolls, and knead it several times according to the 
extended directions already given for common bread. 

This nukkes bread so white and fine that it vies 
with the napkins on the best appointed tables, and 
elicits admiration from the most f uttidious It is a 
feather in the hotel baker's cap when very particu- 
lar, excellent and discriminating housekeepers out- 
side, send to beg a loaf of this extra fine bread for 
their company days. That's the on y sort of pre- 
miums hoi el fellows are ever allowed to win. Re- 
member, this bread should be kneaded 3 or 4 differ- 
ent times, at intervals apart. 



558* Doughnuts for the Million. 

A regular tape Cod man with whom we parleyed, 

* * * he looned as if be sometimes saw a dough- 
n I, but never desceuded tu comfort — tuo grave to 
laugh, too tough to cry, as indifferent as a clam. 

* « « He stood in front of us lelling stories and

of the apple sauce and the doughnuts, which J 
thought had sustained the least detriment from the 
old man's shots. — Hioreau—Cape Cod. 

Why does everybody jaugh when there are dough- 
nuts in the case? Even Thoreau, who laughs but 
Mldom. There is a pleasant little piece about 



doughnuts in the Congrtuitmal Reeord, that yrA8 
spoken by a Pacific coa t senator— it is too long to 
repeat here— atid it is said all the senators laughed 
at that. But if we place on ihe board some royal 
doughnuts, perhaps the ovigiial kind wi'h their 
original German name Arff/y/m-'krapfen with apricots 
or wiih cheese, or flavored with orange flower water, 
it looks as if it will be bard to find the fun that 
dwells in native doughnuts, and, essentially, that is 
all these are, though they have appeared in regal 
billa-of-fare.

German Puffis. 



1 pound of light breikl dough. 
6 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces of sugar. 
i cup of milk. 

10 yolks of eggs. 

1} pounds of flour. 

Little salL 

These dan only be made the soft, light yellow 
puff-balls they ought to be, by a strict and thorough 
method of working the ingredients together. 

Take the dough 6 hours before the meal and mix 
in the butler, sugar, milk and salt. Set in a warm 
place awhile, then thoroughly be%t together. Add 
two yolks at a time and flour by littles alternately, 
beating against the side of the pan. Then turn out 
the dough and knead it on the table. Set away to 
rise about 8 hours Knead the dough twice more, 
as directed for rolls, but more thoroughly^ till air 
will snap firom the edges when pinched. Mould out 
in little balls. Brush these over with melted lard 
to prevent hardening outside. Rise half an hour 
or more on greased pans. Fry in sweet lard. May 
be sugared over or served with sauce, or as dough- 
nuts, cold. They soak grease if raised too much

'•Little Pittsburgh" Doughnuts. 

These are doughnuts with a little history attach, 
ed — but let us make them first. 

4 pounds of light bread dough. 

8 ounces of sugar and syrup mixed. 

2 eggs. 

2 or 3 ounces of lard, melted. 

Powdered sugar to dredge oyer. 

Lard to fry. 

Take the dough from the breakfast rolls, say at 9 
in the morning, in Winter. In Summer the dough 
worked up at mid-day will do. Mix in the ingre- 
dients, let stand half an hour. V\ork up stiff with 
flour sufficient, and pet to rise about 4 hours. Then 
knead, and roll it out to a sheet. Brush over the 
whole sheet of dough with very little melted lard. 
Cut out with a two-pound tomato can, and cut out 
the middle of each with a little empty two ounce 
ground cinnamon can. This makes rings, which

then dropped in hot lard. Sift sugar over when

When Leadyille first began grinding in erowds of 
miniog men poor, and grinding them out rioh, the 
poor men as they went in were often hard put to it 
for something to eat, and they never laughed at a 
doughnut, but treated it with respect. As saloons, 
boarding houses, clothing stores, stables, theatres, 
and eyen saw-mills and wood yards hastened to c*\\ 
themselves the "Little Pittsburgh," for the very fa- 
mous mine which was at first the life of the camp, 
the bakers did likewise, and the makers of the pre- 
ceding excellent doughni!ts finding them a sort of 
bonanza as yet undeveloped, hastened to call them 
Little Piitsburghs, too. Pursuing this vein they 
went o 1 and ad?ei tiled extensively. You could get 
a Little Pit'sburgh doughnut fof ten oems at an; 
hour of the day or night, and a glass of dried^pple 
cider for the same price ; Dut in a commutation 
arrangement you could get a d ughnut and a glass 
of tue cider together for fifteen cents. So Litile 
Pittsburgh doughnuti became a f arr, and indeed, a 
Is^ding feature of the camp. They were in two-line 
local notices scattered all through the papers, so 
that nobody could miss them. It seemed, in fiict, 
as if all the news was gathered for the express pur- 
pose of drawing attention to doughnuts. One day 
it would be: 

**Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars has 
been offered and refused for the Chrysolite mine." 
And as a sequel : 

**There'& noihiagin camp can equal those Little 
Pittsburgh doughnuts." Or, perhaps : 

"Our esteemed fellow ciiisen fell down a shaft 
500 feet deep, last e?ening. He struck on his head 
and probably never knew what hurt him." 

*'0 ! those Little Pittsburgh doughnuts are so 
very fine, if you try them once you'll buy them 
every time, at the Union Bakery." 

So, although the doughnuts were alwayn the same, 
there was always something fresh and pleasant to 
give them a new zest Sometimes it would be only 
a hanging, or a midnight garroting, but the chorus 
of doughnuts kept right on at the end of every per- 
formance, great or smalL As a consequence these 
doughnuts had a great run. It is hard to fathum 
motives. Perhaps some people ate them fr spi e, 
trying to abolish them and their <*damnab]e itera- 
tion," but of course that was useless, there were 
plenty more where these came from. They were 
placed in a tentative way on the best hotel tables, 
and they took — or at least the people took and par- 
took. Evidently these Little Pittsburghs were pop 
nlar with all. 

But the halcyon days of ten-cent doughnuts were 
short and few, for soon competition came and began 
cutting them out with three-pound tomato cans in- 



stead of two-pound, making them so much larger. 
Not satisfied with t bat, other competitors left out 
the eggs and half the i-ugar and sold a five cents. 
There waa no margin to pay fur advertiai- g i:i that. 
Little Pittsburgh doughnuts weakened aud cime 
down and the advertising c ased. None may know 
what subtle connection there may be in the oases, 
but both the Leadville newspapers soon after died, 
and the Little Pittsburgh mine itself experienced a 
temporary collapse I think it would have paid 
both the papers and the mining company to have 
gone on adTertising the doughnuts at bed-rock 
prices, or even free, for when t hey left them out 
they left out the spice of the paper, and as the dough- 
nuts had boosted Little Pittsburgh i' would only 
have been fair for Little Pittsburgh to boost- but it 
is useless moralizing. 

The next are the cheap, light-c )lored and large 
doughnuts that knoc*ied the bottom out of the ricl^ 
brown Little Pittsburghs.

4 ounces of butter or lard 

Make same way as the preceding. Take care to 
have the sugar all well dissolved, and having knead-

Only plain dough, or French roll dough. Cut out 
biecuit shapes, let rise, and fry. These . re very 
often found at railroad lunch stands ; nearly as 
cheap as bread and butter, and very saleable. 

There is a suspicion of tautology in ^the direction 
sometimes given to fry in hot lard ; however, that is 
the shortest way of saying the lard should be already 
hot.

A curled or crisped cake boiled in fat — Waiter, 

The bakers for doughnuts, but women should 

make the crullers every time. Too heavy a hand 

with the sugar and, worse still, with the baking 

powder will make them a burniog disgrace, a greisy 

s'ain upon hotel cookery. Besides, only wonien 

know how or have patience to curl crisp crullers 

into wonderful knots, twirls, twists and riogletM. 



The primitive form of cruller is plain beaten

ribbons, then fried. A handful of sugar added te 
the dough makes a better kind, and many are ihs

For hotel supper tables, to change with dou^h-

Orullers. Best and Quickest. 

2 pounds of flour. 

3 or 4 teaspoonfkils of baking powder. 
Large half pint of mUk. 

4 ounces of butter. 
6 ounces of sugar. 

4 eggs. Salt. Nutmeg flayor. 

Mix the powder in the flour. Dissolve ih$ w^ar 
in the milk, add the eggs, and the butter melted, 
salt and flayer. Pour this fluid mixture into the 
middle of the flour and mix up like biscuit. Cut out 
and fry right away. A quick way to shape them 
is to cut in rings with a double cutter, haying a small 
cutter in the middle, and another way is to cut the 
thin rolled sheet in bands with a paste Jagger, and 
diyide tliat into pieces like three fingers attached at 
one end~-or like a fork head. Sugar ovsr when 
done. 



These orullers take twice as mooh time to fky as 
doughnuts. 

565. 

Biohest Orullers, or Fried Oakes. 

Good to keep, to send to folks by stage or express, 
or to pack up for a fishing party or a mountain 
climbing. Don't put any baking powder in them. 

1^ ounces of powdered sugar. 

6 eggs. Flayoring. 

Half cup of milk. 

6 ounces of butter. 

2 pounds of flour. 

Mix up like cake, by creaming the butter and 
sugar together, then beating in the eggs and milk 
and flour. Boll out, cut in shapes and fry. 



In addition to the foregoing, it may be usefiil to 
remember, all the rusks, buns and brioches can be 
fried as dougnuts when there happens to be more 
dough than is needed to bake. 

5ee. 

Albany Bolls. Vienna Bolls. Delavan 
BoUs. 

Make good roll dough with the finest flour and 
knead it well in layers as already directed for other 
yarieties. 

The milk bread dough is understood to be the 
proper article, but the hotels where milk can be had 
for bread-making must be yery few, and no person 
not otherwise informed can tell the difference be- 
twixt that and our French roll dough. 

1. Mould out little balls as for split rolls. 

2. Boll these out in shape of plates, and very 
thin. 

8« Fold these by brining oyer two opposite 



edges and making them meet in the middle, and 
then bring oyer the other two edges likewise, mak- 
ing a square piece of folded dough. 

4. Boll this out a little flatter, brush oyer with 
melted butter or lard, and fold oyer like other split 
rolls. They are square ended instead of half moon 
shapes. 

This is the slowest and most tedious of all shapes, 
but the rolls are almost as flaky as pie paste. 



50T. BBIOOHB AND BUSKS, 

For Breakfast, Lunch and Tea. 

Perhaps you want to know what sort of a break- 
fast one gets at Young's. I wish this was an essay 
on housekeeping, so that eyery point could be en- 
larged upon. But the same wonder comes up at 
eyery notable restaurant, why people can't haye just 
as good eating at home eyery day and why they 
neyer by any possibility do so. Why the dining, 
room cannot be as cool, as orderly and spotless, the 
melon as orifip, the salad as ft'esh and piquant, the 
cutlet as brown without, a^ melting and juicy with- 
in, or the bread and buiter as perfect as that at 
Young's, will always be remarkable to any one con- 
demned to domestic interiors. — Boston Letter in N, 
r. World, 

Dust unto dust; what must be must. 
If you can't get crumbs, you had best eat crust. 

-^ Old Song. 

She would talk of the last tragedy with the em- 
phatic toneof aconnois eur, in tbe same b.eath that 
she wor.ld ask, with Maria Antoinette, why the poor 
people were so clamorous for bread wben they mijj^t 
buy such nice brioche for two-pence apiece — Bultoer- 
Pelham. 

The aboye allusion to brioche appears in nearly 
the same words also in one of Dumas* prefaces — 
'*Louise de la Valliere*' — I think, but the solecism 
circulates with the point open other articles of diet 
as well; as in one place the surprise is that poor 
peasants should prefer potatoes to meat, and only 
last month, in a magazine, it was a **French prin. 
cess," and "chicken broth " 



So far as Hying on the best of bread goes, there 
need be no reason why people condemned to do- 
mestic interiors should haye to suffer from the com- 
parison with those in hotels and restauraots, for 
after the details of the simple art of making tt, set 
forth in these columns, there is only needed dili- 
gence and a proper degree of pride in the resulting 
product. 



The English are corrupting our language dread, 
fully. They call our crackers biscuits; our biscuits 
they call Scotch scones; our muffins, if they haye 
them, seem not to be called muffins, for that name 
is giyen to a poorer sort that is baked on a kind of 
griddle, and in like manner they call our rusk buns, 
while fresh and hot, and only accept them as rusks 
when sliced and dried brown in the oyen.

ties of hot breads which seem to be popular 7 associ-

a'so forming parts of a course in some ''royal'' din-

At the great meat, fowl, fish and potato suppers 
and breakfiists of American hotels, these kinds seem 
to find no proper place. They are well worth prac- 
ticing, howcYer, for more domestic occasions, and 
htTe always been considered the highest test of 
skill in bread-making. 



568. Brioche, or Butter Busks. 



1 pound of good, liyely, roll dough. 
6 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces of sugar. 

Half cup of milk or oream* 
10 yolks of eggs. 

Little salt. 

l\ pounds of flour. 

They require 5 hours time to make, raise and

Beat in the yolks, two at a time, and most of the 
flour« gradually bringing the mixture to a smooth, 
yellow dough Then knead it thoroughly, and after 
that set it away to rise. In about three hours knead 
the dough the second time, and an hour after knead 
once more, then make out as direct ed for French 
rolls and notch the edges with a knife, to make the 
shape shown in the cut of rolls. 

They rise and bake in the same time as rolls. 
Brush oyer with butter when done. 

500. The Many ITses of Brioche. 

It being eminently French, and every French 
eook maning brioche by a different receipt — usu- 
ally with more buuer than the foregoing — as might 
be expected, this unsweetened kind of cake figures 
considerably in French cookery. One says it is a 
spongy kind of cake resembling Bath buns. An- 
other says it should be rich, yellow and like a 
sponge, whence ic tikes its name. One mixes rai- 
sins, currants and shred citron in it for lu ch and 
tea bread, and makes it in various fancy shapes and 
twists, also in large cakes. Another bakes the 
dough in form of round rolls, cuts off the top, takes 
out the crumb and fills with chicken or other meat, 
or, bakes in little moulds like oval gem pans, re- 
moves the inside and places in the shell or timbale 
thus made a cooked bird with its gravy and dishes a 
pyramid of these on a napkin. Still another steeps 



slices of brioche in orange syriip and fries them in> 
closed in batter as fritters; and at a costly and ele- 
gant dinner given in New York,, on last Christmas, 
'*brioche crusts, with firuit*' appeared among the 
pastries. But the following sweet varieties might 
be employed for that. 

One point in bread making that, like hand, 
moulding, can only be learned through practice is 
the right pitch of lightness to be allowed Some 
stress has been laid on thn lightness, sponginess and 
large size of rolls and lonves, because of the aver- 
sion we all have to heavy bread, which is ruinous 
to health. The inexperieoced are cautioned against 
running to the other extreme There is a point 
when the rolls have reached a certain height they 
begin to settle out of shape and to crack open. A 
little before this is the time to bake. 

Butter rusks of our pattern should open and curl 
backwards in baking, therefore should not be 
brushed over with butter when panned as rolls 
are. 



5TO. 



French Sweet Busks. Richest. 



The receipt for making these is inquired for at 
places where they are made in perfection, perhaps 
oftener than any other. They are cakes rather 
than bread ; very showy, and never fail to attract 
notice, {^hould only be attempted with the strong- 
est yeast or lightest dough, as they are otherwise 
slow to rise. The art to be acquired through prac- 
tice is to make them eUutie and pleasant eating, not 
clammy like half-baked bread. 

1 pound of light dough. 

6 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

6 yolks and 1 whole egg. 

Ha^f cup of milk. 

Flavoring as indicated below. 

1^ pounds of flour. 

If for afternoon tea, take the dough fh>m the 
breakfast rolls, and six hours before the rusks are 
wanted place it in a pan with the butter, sugar and 
cream. Let all get warmed through and the butter 
softened, then mix them thoroughly. Next add the 
eg 8 and flour by littles, alternately, beating the 
mixture up against the side of the pan, to make it 
smooth and elastic. Spread the last handful of 
flour on the table, knead the dough as for rol^s, 
pressing and spreading it out with the knuckle:), 
and folding it over repeatedly. Set it in a warm 
place for 2 or 3 hours. Then knead it the eec* 
ond time. Every time the dough is doub^ed on it- 
eelf the two edges should be pressed together first. 
When the dough of this and of the br'oche receipt is 
good and finished it looks silky, and air will snap 
from the edge when it is pinched. After thi.; seo-

5TT. Bnfflish Oonunon Muffins. 

Baked in rings on a huge griddle and carried 
around to customers, firom the phops. Simply a 
common bread sponge of the cheapest, the muffins 
being pulled apart and toasted, almost iayariably, 
before they are eaten. 

2 pounds of flour. 

1 quart of mixed water and yeast. 

1 tablespoonful of salt. 

Mix the aboTe together carefiilly, to haye no lumps 
in it, at noon. The water should be warm and the 
sponge set to rise in a warm place. At about 8 
beat the sponge thoroughly, and the longer the bet. 
ter, with spoon or paddle, and let ri«e agiin. Beat 
up again before using. Set tin riogi the size of 
saucers on the gridd'e, half fill thpm wi h the batter, 
let bake light b-own on the bottom, then turn them 
OTcr and bake the other side. The batter should be 
thicker than for pancakes and thinner than frit. 
ters. 



The preceding being the cheapest made for sale, 
private parties make richer qualities with milk and 
a little shortening. 

The Boston muffin man had a name for some kind 
of a hot breakfist and tea cake which the great 
word.cateher dictionaries have failed to rake in. 
The word was pyflit; his painted sign read "Muffins, 

Pyflifs, Oatcakes, Qofferi*, Made Here by .** 

His place was a red brick, private house on Li- 
quorpond street— of course everybody knows Li- 
quorpond street, Boston — it leads into High street 
on the north and the Witbam river runs at the back 
of the old brick stores on the fUrther side of that, 
and the river itself is as lively as a street when the 
tide is up, although its channel to tl.e sea is only 
maintained by means of bundles of wicker stuff, 
like the Mississippi jetties. The muffin man used 
to start out punctual to the moment, morning and 
evening, and cry "muffins and py flits" -> and them 
enly, so his literary customers must have known 
what "pyflils" meant. In that they had the advan. 
tage of these columns. In saying literary custo- 
mers we only give honor where honor is due, for 
Boston has always been fiBkmous for literature and 
good hotels. The Roberts Brothers were located in 
Narrow Bargate, opposite the "Red Lion Inn " 



They used to issue a compendium with their alma- 
nac, and tried to p^eafe the Middlemarch people a^d 
"lay over" John Noble, the other bookseller, by 
ieiving out the horse-doctoring matter and s'gns of 
Zodiac, and putting in fine pictures from the art 
union instead. These Roberts', striking into a new 
path right through the fences of old custom, were 
both young men. But of the hotels, the "Peacock" 
was the ooe patronized by the American travellers. 
(Hawthoroe's England and Italy.) The "Red 
Lion" was frequented, principally, by "Cripps. the 
Gamer," and the "White Hart" by the farmers, and 
the "White Horse" by market people. Boston stee-

architectural glory, into the woild of rookn i-nd 
crows, three hundred feet above these all. It can 
be seen thirty miles out at sea, and from Lincoln 
Minster, thirty miles the other way.. But of course 
evf ry Bostonian knows of the presence of this great 
tower, although he may never raise hii eyes to look 
at it so common, nor care to remember old John Cot

his mysterious pyflits, not to be found ia the una-

Hotel cooks probably have different estimates of 
the public likes and dislikes from other and domes- 
tic peoples'. Their opportunities are different. Th€i 
conditions are different. The restraints are re- 
moTcd from the peopl e who eat, and they indulge 
their tastes without the hindrances of economic 
considerations. The cooks know no individuals, 
but as the tide comes and goes they learn what the 
tide of humanity likes to consume the most of For 
instance, one fayorite article which is not found half 
often enough is graham cakes.

Speaking of the way the English mis-oall things, 
there is a very pretty London cook book making the 
remark that something in the batter cake line is 
baked^ona "girdle** in Scotland, where "gird- 
lea" are in common use, but as tbey are little 
known in England the cake must be baked on the 
stove plate. The idea of calling a griddle a girdle 1 
The griddle is in common use in New Jersey, but is 
little known in York Slate. And if no griddles in 
England what do tbey do for buckwheftt cakes ? 
Dreadful supposition — perhaps ihey have none ! 
Time for somebody to start American kitchens over 
there. So that is the reason why Scotland is apos- 
tr phtsed as 

•<Land o' cakes I and John o'Oroates," 
And barley bannocks; and England is not honored

After the first mixing with yeast some of the bat- 
ter may be t^aTed and used instead of yeast for seye- 
ral succeeding days. A teaspoon ful of carbonate of 
8>da may then be needed to be mixed in the batter 
n the morning, but cakes made that way, for some 
reason, are more palatable than with sweet yeast — 
care being taken to proportion the soda to the de- 
gree of slight soutness. 

The neatest way to grease the eake griddle is with 
a piece of ham rind out off large for the purpose, aod 
the batter should be poured from a pitcher, or a can 
haying a coffee pot spout. 

H here the smoke and smell is an objection the 
c%kes e*n be baked just as well without grease, not 
only on soapetone griddles but on iron ones as well, 
if they be rubbed with a cloth after every baking, to 
keep them polished. VI e do not insist on the adop 
tion of the cleaner plan, beoause cakes half fried

Bakinff Waffles. 



Waffles, it must be owned, are the terror of hotel 
cooks in ordinary positions, chiefly because people 
will persist in taking waffles just before they begin 
the meni, waffles for the meal, and more waffles just 
after the meal, making nine hundred orders of 
waffles for three hundred persons. But as waffles 
make a house popular and are a means of distaoc- 
iog competition hotel stewards and proprietors ofien 
fiod it good polipy to look upon waffles without 
prejudice, and proyide for their extensiye manufac 
ture by furoishing the proper waffle range, thus 
saying a hand and no end of confusion, waste, 
smoke, ioconyenience, profanity and disappoint- 
ment. Of course this applies to lai^ business. A 
stoye and the common waffle irons may do yery well 
for fifty persons — the guage of these receipts. 



Sweet waffles bum so easily that they cannot be 
baked fast. When waffles do not brown fast enough 
add sugar or syrup. The only remedy for waffles 
sticking to the irons is to keep the irons in constant 
US') with scraping and rubbing out with lard while 
hot, and ayoid letting ^hem bum with nothing in 
them. To bake waffles, pour in one side a spoonful 
of melted lard, shut up and turn oyer the iron two 
or three times and then place a spoonful of batter 
in each compartment. Shut and turn oyer to the 
fire frequently till both sides are brown.

But to diyert attention from waffles it is only 



necessary to announce clam pancakes. And su^^ely 
they are a Yankee inyention and of local fame only 
at that, for nowhere in print, not eyen on clam can- 
labels can such a dish apparently be found. This 
is the route by which clam pancakes haye reached 
these columns: A number of pleasure-seeking peo- 
ple occupying the broad piazza and the hundred ras- 
tic chairs at a hotel in the shadow of Pikes Peak, 
between dancing and promenading and the pause in 
the music got to talking about the sea-side and per 
consequence about dams. There was one among 
them who had trayelled on the staff of the Grand 
Duke Alexis, and speaking of yarious persons* likes 
and preferences it came at last to '<0, clams plain are 
all yery well, clam Aritters, clam stew, clam patties, 
but leaying out chowder there is nothing made of 
dams equal to our Yankee clam pancakes*'. 

"Why cant we haye them here?** 

"Why of course we can.*' 

It is tme Pikes Peak is a long way from Olamdom 
but canned clams do yery well. The cook had to be 
instracted, and after that still yentured to ask 
"What do you eat with them?** <*Butter and syrap, 
just like any the other batter cakes,"

butter rusks, sweet rusks and waffles the thorough

Sugar in small quantities makes bread crust 
paper-like, thin and soft.. Too much makes bread 
•puddingy. Yolk of eggs counteracts sugar, and 
dries the bread out, also makes the crust crisp and 
biittle. White of egg makes thick, tough crust 
like leather that has been wet and dried. Shorten- 
ing makes little difference besides lessening the 
siiinginess of well-made bread. Sweet rusks and 
cakes are slow to rise and slow to bake. Such bread 
as muffins and Sally Lunn usually rises too fast and 
too much.

About Bakhiff Powder, and How Not 
to Use It. 

Dost thou think, because thou art yirtuous, there 
shall be no more cakes and ale 7 — TSoelfih Night. 

After aU that has been shown of the manner of 
making the best of bread without baking powder, it 
must be plain to see that the way to ayoid the inju. 
ries arising ft'om baking powder adulteration is to 
use good yeast instead. The use of powder does not 
need tobecLCouraged, it, like many other non-es- 
sential articles, is good in its place, but it is the 
lazy cook's resort; it tends to inferiority in cooking; 
it causes an expenditure of money for that which is 
not nutriment but which at its yerv best is but empty 
air and at its w»rst carries after the air a residue of 
poison. And yet baking powder is good to a certain 
degree. But how few can make baking powder 
bread anything but a sorry substitute for bread 7

ciyilized places where men in haste and carelessness

ing powder is used in such vast quantities as people 
who liye where oooking is done might find impossi 
ble to belieYe. That its manufacture must be 
yifiTj profitable is shown in many ways; by the im- 
mense number of different brands, the number of 
new and expensive wajs of putting it up in pack- 
ages, and of employing agents, traveliDg equipment 8 
and printing and advertisiog, equaling the sewiog 
maohine business of patent times, or patent medioioe 
business of all times, and this without any monopoly 
for any one. Besides the immense fnotories of the 
large cities most of the small cities and outfitiing 
points of the west have finns engaged in the muiu- 
fhoture. Kansas City has one, Denyer has two, and 
of these one alone advertises that it ships fh»m three 
to four tons of powder per month to the mountain 
towns. At the same time oar loads are arriving of 
perhaps forty different brands fSrom the 



Baking powder was first eztensiYely advertised 
for sale and generally introduoed about the years 
1846 to 1860. Flaming posters appeared in all the 
towns oalling it Qerman yeast, or baking powder, 
claiming that a yield of about twenty pounds more 
bread trom a barrel of flour could be had by its use 
than by yeast raising, on the ground that ordinary 
yeast changes a portion of the flour into air in fer- 
mentation, and claiming for powder the effect ot 
eggp, and another saving. Chemists ceriificates 
were appended to say that the powder when evapo- 
rated in the bread left only an extremely smnll re- 
mainder, and that was but chloride of sodium, or 
oommon salt, and no disadvantage. 



Supposing the last to be true, it is on the pre- 
sumption that either cream of tartar or tortaric acid 
are used in makiug the powder, and that they are so 
perfectly proportioned as to exactly counteract each 
other and banish each other in the form of air, fri m 
the bread. Otherwise a residue of one or other 
must remain, and other acids and alkalis may be 
used having the same or stronger effects but leaving 
still more harmful remiinders. Both before and 
after the introduction of commercial bakiog powders 
pastry cooks used to make their own. But cream 
of tartar was found most unreliable because of lack 
of uniformity in its adulteration. Some samples 
would contain so much starch or worse nuktters that 
four teaspoonfuls were required to counteract one 
teaspoonful of soda. With tartaric acid ready pow- 
dered the eame difficulty was experienced. Tartaric 
acid in crystals, powdered in a mortar at home as 
wanted, was the only reliable recourse to avoid hav- 
ing biscuit spoiled either one way or the other. The 
proportious are one teaspoonful of powdered tartaric 
acid to two of carbonate of soda — the reverse of 
cream of tartar proportioned. The ScierUtfie Ameri- 
can has published a number of different formulas f t 
making baking powders. Many of the manufactur- 



ers accuse others of employing cheap but injurious 
substitutes for soda and acid, and here is a hint of 
another kind of deterioration. 



A man came around a new western town offering 
to sell a receipt for making baking powder which 
was to effect a great saving to all consumers. The 
price asked for the precious bit of information was 
one dollar. When my turn came to be canvassed I 
told him that knowing of quite a number of baking 
powder mixtures already I had just fifty cents worth 
of curiostiy left to know what he had to impart. So 
for that sum I obtained the following : 



XUBKKA BAKUra FOWDI&. 

Bi-oarbonate of soda, 16 ounces; tartaric add, 12 
ounces; cream of tartar, 2 ounces; fine flour 8 
pounds. 

There is two pounds of real baking powder and 
flour enough added to make five pounds weight. 
Starch has more the appearance of real baking 
powder than flour. Does not this go fkr to expUtiii 
the yariations in strength and the inducements to 
push the sale of cheap powders? Cost price of 
flour, 4 cents; starch, 10 cents; selling price of pow- 
der the difference.

It being our sole business to teach how to make 

good bread and to inquire into the nature of the ob- 
stacles that throw us, we have no remedies to offer 
against these adulterations other than the first men- 
tioned, viz : to use little or none at all, and employ 
good yeast instead. In the palmy days of French 
cookery, when culinary excellence was carried, un- 
der the auspices of fashion, to an extreme never sur* 
passed since, baking powder was unknown, and the 
bakers' more objeciionable carbonate of ammonia 
was un thought of. The finest cakes were made 
light either with brewer's yeast, like those at (he 
end of this book; with air beaten in mechanically, 
like our common sponge cakes; or with the fine parti- 
cles of cold butier as in pound cake^the same agent 
tbat imparls such extreme lightness to puff-paste. 
Waffles and pancakes at the same time were made 
of extreme delicacy by means of white of eggs whip- 
ped to a froth, being really a mass of air bubbles, 
fine as snow, incoi^orated in the mixture, there to 
expand in the heat of baking and raise the whole. 



Baking powder is the cook's labor-saiing friend, 
but if the friend be treacherous a d unreliable shall 
we not accept bis good offices with caution ? All we 
can gain from him is gas to expand into big holes in 
the bread in the oven, and a teaspoonful of soda to 
a pint of Eour buttermilk yields the same. In <*o]d 
fashioned" gingerbread a teaspoonfUl of soda added

There is no established limit to the times the 
dough may be beaten out, but after a few times it 
begins to break instead of spread. This injures it, 
and an internal should be allowed for the dough to 
lose its toughness. The air in the hollows beaten

603. Baking Powder Biscuit. 



2 pounds or quarts of flour. 

4 ounces of melted lard or butter. 

4 teasroonfuls of powder. 

1 « of salt. 

1} pints of tepid water or milk. 

Mix the powder in the flour dry. Place the melt- 
ed lard in a hollow in the middle, the salt and water 
or milk with that, and stir around, drawing the flour 
in graduaUy so as to make a smooh, soft d ugh

Of all the atrocious frauds in the way of bread 
perhaps the worst is the baking-powder biscuit of 
unskillful cooks, sometimes found iu boarding hous- 
es and low-prioed restaurants. The compulsory 
spoiling of biscuit through excessiye ecc>nomy of in- 
gredients may be pardonable in the cooks, but the 
atrocity of spoiling them with too much richness 
and wrong way of working, neyer. Such biscuit 
are yellow, dirty on the bottom, greasy to the touch; 
they haye rough sides, no edges, for they rise tall 
and narrowing towards the top ; they are wrinkled 
and fireckied and ugly ; they will not part into white 
and eatable flakes or slices, but tumble in brittle 
crumbs from the fingers, and eat like smoked saw- 
dust. Strange, that the same materials should make 
things so different as these and good biscuit. 

Biscuit dough should be made up soft. The short- 
eoirg should be melted and added to the fluid milk- 
warm, to insure thorough incorporauon. 

The priyate house way cf kneadiog the dough up 
into dumpliog shape, perpetually breikiog the 
layers and making the parted edges take up too 
much flour, is the wrong way that ruins biscuit. 
Tbe right way is giyen in the receipt.

When a seidlitz, or any efferresoent powder is 
dropped into a glass of water the gas produced rush- 
es to the top and immediately escapes, but if a poi^ 
tion of a raw egg be mixed in the water first, or 
some dissoWed gum arabic, it catches and holds the 
gas on top in the form of firoth, as in soda syrups. 
The same effect in some degree is observable when 
an egg is mixed in baking-powder bread. A film is 
formed that hold<9 the air, the dough may be aUow- 
ed a few minutes to become lighter, and the rolls 
are more spongy than if made without.

unaToidable in a cook book, where people seeking

While endeavoring to observe and respect the dis- 
tinction between solid insitruction and mere opinion 
we must say that the practice of yeast-raised cakes 
ought to be far more general among American pas- 
trycooks and bakers than it is. The dreary repeti- 
tion of middling pound cake and poor sponge cake, 
with a sorry variation or two, might with advantage 
be broken up by the introduction of some of the sorts 
which great cooks of old used to set before the king. 
That was before cooks began to begrudge a little 
work in behalf of excellence. 

In the European countries where they cannot af- 
ford to be so extravagant as we are, when there is 
to be a festival, the first thing the managers do is, 
go to the baker, either buy enough light dough, aod 
some notable housekeeper makes it into cheap but 
good cake for the multitude, or else the baker him- 
self gets the contract. In this way plum cake itself 
becomes a cheap treat, while still richer and fkr 
more delicate varieties are made for the wealthy by 
the same general method with difilerence of de*

* *. — Lever s Tom Burke. 

I have remarked before that not one person in a 
thoustnd knows bow to make good toast. The sim. 
plest dishes seem to be the ones oftenest spoiled* 
If, as is generally done, a thick slice of bread la 
hurriedly exposed to a hot fire, and the exterior of 
the bread is toasted nearly blaok, * * etc. 
£fenderson» 



There, you see, boya and girls, you had bettor 
make that toast right and not jam it down on the hot 
range top with gnashing of teeth so savagely. Not 
one in a thousand of you but knows how to make 
toast beautifully, but you have an invindble aversion 
to it; yon think a person who will order toast a 
monster, that to be hated needs but to be seen; you 
want to know why such people can't eat all these 
nice hot breads and batter cakes, and you call 
them pet names which it will never do to put in 
print. 

Of course you think it the cook's business to make 
toast, but that depends on circumstances, for toast 
must be nrade just as it is ordered, and one of the 
cooks is busy broiling beefsteak and h<im to order 
and another is busy dishmg up side dishes and fry- 
ing fresh potatoes. Baking cakes and waffles and 
dishing up breids keeps another agoing, so s me- 
body besides must make the toast. The vegetable 
ook might be hired with the understanding that 
toast making was one of the duties to be performed, 
and would do well at supper, but the two or three 
hours of breakfast is the vegetable cook's busiest 
time. It would not be so hard to make good toast 
if there was a place provided for it when the hotel 
kitchen is furnished and fitted up, but whoever in 
such a case ever thinks of that ? Put it upon the 
cook and he must almost perforce bake the toast by 
panfuls in the oven, but no persons, if they can bdp 
themselves, will eat that except as milk toast. The 
broiler is full and has no room but for mea's There 
is only the range top left available and that must be 
kept so hot that there is little chance of being able 
to do good, baking inside at the same time.

oharooal broiler aside from the meat work would be 
placed in every hotel kitohen at the first, when 
aaoh expenses are not so reluctantly incurred as af- 
ter some time of fcrambliog along without. 

In hotels where the t- ast difficulty is well over- 
oome there is ei her an extra hand from some other 
department appointed for the duty, and the t'ast 
range or broiler to work on, or else, in smaller 
houses where the dining room work is not rushing, 
the waiters them^elTes, preparing a little toast just 
befoie he doors are opened for a start, are able to 
mahe ir as wanted, and to suit the special orders. 

The best wRy where there is no special broiler, is 
to provide half a dozen wire hinged oyster broilers 
or toasters and lay them with the bread in them on 
top of the hot range. 



OIO. Oonoludinir Hints. 

Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all 
thy might. — Ancient Book. 

Things done by halves are never done right. — 
Modem Paraphrase, 

Considering how extensive is the domain of hotel 
cookery there is no likelihood that we shall ever re- 
cur to the items of bread and rolls again, and a few 
omissions in the foregoing matters must be nuUle 
good here. 

The hardest thing to teach the tyro in mixing bread 
is to mftke the small quantity of dough soft enough 
in warm weather. Fortunately, with large masses the 
labor with s iff dough is so severe that few people 
err that way, but a li'tle in active summer weather 
fermentation easily takes up too much flour and be- 
comes roogh and rotten, and all the instructions in 
the wor d will not help the "pastry" who does not 
know enough to temper the dough a.-cordiog to the 
weather. In winter when all the materials and tools 
are cold the stifier the dough the better; m summer 
use lessi yeast and mix soft. 

80 in mixing biscuit. I have, before now, when 
training down the rawness of a lot of picked-up 
summer resort help, placed all the ingredients for 
biscuits for the early breakfast of a party of tremen* 
dous trout fishers, in a pan, and then a baker who 
was a bread baker and nothing else has utterly 
spiled them in the mixing, making them harder 
than crackers and not half as good. Biscuit should 
be mixed as soft as fritter batter, so that when the 
scrapings vf the'panin flour and scraps of dough are 
added it can still be pressed out easily with the flat 
hands till worked smooth. Whenever your biscuit 
dough is so tough that the doubled fists must be 
used !o press it out, conclude that you have made 
the common mistake, and have something yet to 
learn about mixing biscuit. 

Mould out your dough for rolls in little round 



ball«. Easier said than done. The beginner takes 
the pieces of dough in hand but they won*t roll, but 
skate all over the table instead. You must brush 
away th « fl-^ur, have the table bo that the rolls wiU 
aim 'St s ick to it, very slightly dust your hands 
with flour, take two fresh, moist pieces and roll 
them under the hands with a slight pressure. The 
ball of the thumb draws the outside of the dough to- 
wards the palm and makes a smooth ball Of course 
you must mould two at once, using both hands, else 
yon will never get ready for breakfast. Expert 
hands seldom stop to out off the little pieces of 
dough; they can grab the right sized pieces for rolls 
from the lump with both hands, as quick as wink- 
ing. Vou injure the dough by much moulding. 
The quicker you can get a smooth outside the bet* 
ter. 



Brush your hot loaves from the oven with water. 
They are going to shrink as they cool, and if the 
crust will not give, the crumb will part inside and 
make broken slices. 

The bakers have a sayiugthat it don't matter how 
you mould up the loaves if yon make the dough 
good. But that is only a comparative way of 8p» an- 
ing, and they don't have to slice and toast their 
bread as we do, and see the rough ends and broken 
slices go to waste by the bushel. If the reader will 
turn back to our directions for moulding hotel loaves 
he will find a way that makes loaves as smooth and 
seamless as a watermelon, but it remains to s ly that 
m'>uldingtheloave8 round first isdone in either of two 
ways. If you are in practice with rol!s you can 
mould small loaves with both hands, the same way. 
If not, do ss the bakers do with 'Hin loaves" and 
Vienna bread. The shop bakers like to make loaves 
in tia moulds because they use for that soft dough 
carrying much water, and gaining for them several 
pounds in a barrel of flour The bread so made is 
moist to cut and to keep and does not crumble. But 
as every loaf will expand in the oven and may open 
Ht the ends like the gaping shell of a dead oyster, it 
is the business of the moulder to form and fold the 
loaf so that it shall open and rise just where he wills 
it, and nowhere else. 

To mould *<tin loaves :" Your dough being prop- 
erly kneaded in layers leave it lying in a rather 
thin sheet. Cut that into the right sized squares for 
loaves. The expert workman makes them a little 
longer one way than the other. Take one of the 
pieces, press it out with the knuckles, double it, 
making a square. Catch the furthest corner with 
the extended fingers and pull it over, and under the 
wrists, which press it in the middle. Turn the piece 
of dough under the hands and reach another corner. 
Six motions makes a round, smooth loaf with a mid- 
dle deprefsion made by the wrists. 

Now exiend this depression lengthwise, forming 
a trough shape by pounding and lengthening th« 



164 



THB AKBBIOAN PASTBT COOK. 



middle with the wrists while pulling over the round- 
iog side with the fingers. Finally roll over the thick 
urther side into the hollow middle, the other or 
near side formiog the top lap to the rolled up loaf, 
and place it in the briok-shaped mould. Pre^s it 
down slightly ia the mould to make square corners. 
This loaf will rise the way the bakers like to see — 
parted on one side, where the seam was left, and 
•bowing the whiteness of the inside without a break 
in the bread. 



Our pio-nio loaves described near the beginning 
are eallf d StolUn by the German bakers. This kind 
of sweetened bread is often made richer with addi 
tions of citron, etc. The bakers make up the loaves 
as just described, only doubling the two sides to- 
gether instead of rolling, making a long split roll 
without any brushing with lard at all. 

In addition to the names Kauglauff and Ktigtloff 
applied to tha Tarieties of yeast raised cakes, of 
which iSto/^ is one,Urbain-Dubois spells it Oongloff, 
making three authorised ways, all meaning the 
same as Polish Baba^ which is a general term for 
raised cakes, and French Savarin which, according 
to Dubois' umiiim serves to designate several vaiieties 
of cakes. These things are mentioned as helping 
to throw light on the mysteries of foreign fncniw, 
which "our own correspondents" in Europe delight 
to humiliate their Western cousins with. 



Now. about moulding French loaves. We have 
been unwilling to poach in the exclusive shop bak- 
er's grounds further than the thoroughness and use- 
fulness aimed at in our book compelled, and will 
only add tbis; If you wish to try a more workman- 
like way than that previously set forth, commence 
as for *Min loaves," with wrists and fingers msking 
the piece of dough into a round ball slightly de- 
pressed. Push these aside on a well floured part of 
the table till all are moulded. Make the trough .like 
depression across these with a rolling pin instead of 
the wrists, using plenty of flour, and depressing all 
before folding any. As no lard is used and bakers 
do not cut the loaves, the flour and the incidental 
drying of the dough while waiting, helps the desired 
parting open of the seam when baking. Having 
practised thus far you can double the loaves like 
split rolls— without any greasing — and experiment 
further at your pleasure. 

In a large western city the writer knew a baker 
who sold little French loaves (petite-pains) in quan- 
liiies that can best be described as cart loads, and 
he made ihem almost as just above described. Tak- 
ing the four corners of the little flat pieces of dougb, 
he pressed them with the points of the fingers into 
the middle, and with a blow of the edge of the open 
hand made the roll ready for a little rolling pin de- 
pression, making it very long and narrow, then 



f inching up the two thick sides together, slightly 
lapping one upon the other, and without any touch 
cf lard about them, he placed them in pans so that 
when raised and baked they opened out cleft rolls of 
very fine appearance and of flaky texture. 

Practice Makes Perfect. 



Pastry cooks and bakers wishing their French 
rolls to open up tall and lean backwards, only touch 
a streak of melted lard on one side of the deprefsed 
piece of dough, just where the lips, when the roll is 
doubled, meet, and none on the top. This gives the 
roll a start to open without quite making a split roll 
of iL Different stewards and bosses having different 
notions about how these things should be it is often 
difficult for a young man, however willing and cap- 
able, to get a foothold with them without the 
knowledge of just such variations of method as the 
above. 

e»o. 

Sorry there should be such a thing as a warmed 
over roll in the world, but there will always happen 
to be whole pans of the nicest rolls left over, and 
somebody will always want breakfast at four in the 
morning and expect hot bread. The very best way 
to warm over .rolls, so that none but the most criti- 
cal can tell them firom fireeh baked, is this : Wei a 
clean cloth in olean water— half a flour sack, for 
instance— 4Mid wring it out. Lay this over your 
cold rolls and set them in the oven. In about five 
minutes, or when the cloth is dry, the rolls will be 
warmed through and almost as good as new. 

Never, if it can be avoided, let the rolls stay ia 
pans over night — ^it soils the bottom cnist. Tom 
them out to dry. 

If your iron pails soil the crust of the steamed 
brown bread, it can be prevented by lining them 
with manilla paper, lightly brushed over with 
melted lard« The loaves come out looking as nice as 
oKke. 

By the way, we forgot to put the cross mark on 
the hot cross buns. It has no use, however, except 
once a year, on good Friday, to enable British chil- 
dren to make a few pennies by selling them, perpet} 
uating some old custom, nobody seems to know for 
a certainty what. 

A cross mark cut on the bans as they are placed 
in the pans will remain and show; but if yon let the 
buns rise half light enough, then with a chopping 
knife cut down deep, and let the buns finish rising, 
the depression will remain and make the buns ap- 
pear to be in four parts. 

Those bun-sellers make the **one-a-penny.bnns" 
a little richer than the «two-a-penny-bans;" and 
they have to be a little larger, too, or else when the 
oDe.a-penny-two-a.penny.hol-cross*buns are all in a 
basket together, they wouldn't know 'tother from 
which, you know.

TWENTY WAYS OF OOOKINa CORN 
eU. MEAL. 



"Com 18 the most widely oultiyftted grain in the 
world, with the ezeeption of rioe.*' 

**Ab to nutritiTe matter, com is only exceeded by 
wheat, and lollowed by rice among the leading arti- 
oles of food. Calculated according to the physilogi- 
cal wants of the system, a week's diet for an adult 
would only cost about twenty cents, and, excepting 
split peas, there is nothing approaching corn for 
economy." 

"Eren in the United* States, where thirty-seven 
million acres are devoted to the culture of Indian 
com, yielding a total product of thirteen hundred 
million bushels, while the wheat crop of the world 
is only seven hundred and sixty million bushels, we 
only understand the economic value of com as cattle 
food." 

"In buying wheat flour, the same outlay would 
purchase double the amount of nutriment in Indian 
meal. The prejudice against the use of com as an 
article of human food is based on ignorance in many 
cases, and on false pride in others. Wheat is most 
agreeable to the taste, and is preferred by a greater 
portion of the human family, or, at least, by those 
who are able to purchase it. While all the world is 
familiar with wheat as an article of food, not one- 
tenth of its population' ever heard of Indian com ex- 
cept as cattle food. It is quite remarkable that not- 
withstanding its acknowledged good qualities and its 
economy, yet it is but little known to the people oi 
those portions of Europe to whom cheap food is an 
absolute necessity ; and even in times of fkmine it 
has required judicious and persistent governmental 
efforts to induce famishing communities to use it." 

The preceding statements, taken here and there 
finom an able statistical article in the Boston CkUUva- 
tor, suggest the conclusion that it would be a good 
thing in a general way, if all people could be led to 
like corn better than wheat. It is our business to 
believe that such a consummation can be reached 
solely through the instrumentality of the cooks ; by 
the more general diffusion of knowledge of the best 
ways of using com meal, and encouragement to put 
in those extra careful touches which are needed to 
make even the best receipts thoroughly successful. My 
own experience as a cook warrants the assertion that 
corn bread properly made and carefully baked, can 
be made popular almost anywhere. The small loaf 
that at first finds no takers is presently in demand, 
and then gives place to one of twice or thrice the 
sixe, a proportionate amount of wheat bread being 
thereby displaced. 

That an entire community, state or nation may 
have a real preference for com over wheat bread, is 
shown by the fact of the matter in the Southern 
States, where com bread is never out of place, even 
at the best furnished tables. 



The rich breads and puddings with which we shall 
first lead com meal into general favor, are not com- 
mended on the score of cheapness, except in country 
places where eggs and butter have but little market 
value; but that it is a real liking for corn meal, pure 
and simple, and not for the condiments, which ob- 
tains among so large a proportion of the Southerners, 
is seen firom the fact that the prevailing dinner 
bread at the most expensively provided steamboat 
and hotel tables was formerly, and probably is yet, 
the com cake made of nothing whatever but meal 
and water. 

Why one section should prefer a com diet more 
than another when there is no consideratiion of econ- 
omy involved at all, I have never seen fUlly accounted 
for, and will venture the supposition that it shows 
the result of tastes trained in early life by a race of 
domestic cooks who knew how to make com bread 
g^od. What has been done can be done again. 

It will not be expected that we professed cooks 
shall dabble either in political economy or social sci- 
ence, but I, for one, cannot help thinking that a bet- 
ter knowledge of the ways to make com meal a pal- 
atable diet, diffused throughout the land, would re 
suit in bringing the fiifleen-cents-per-bushel com of 
Kansas and Nebraska into its proper use— of fUr. 
nishing cheap and wholesome food and luxuries for 
the million. 

In the culinary departments of the best American 
hotels, it is but reasonable to expect that the greatest 
perfection in compounding American specialties will 
have been attained. However there is only one not- 
able instance of a large hotel becoming celebrated 
for its corn bread, even that is nearly forgotten, now 
that there is no more call for special commissions to 
go and teach the art to Europe. 

I have seen "going the rounds," what purported 
to be a receipt for St. Charles com bread, which 
mentioned sugar as one of the ingredients, but can- 
not' consider it genuine. Different cooks may have 
had different ways, but the following was the form- 
ula in use on the floating palaces of the same day, 
such steamboats as the Southern Belle and the Mag- 
nolia, of the "coast" trade, and the long-trip boats 
which made the excellence of this bread known on 
the upper rivers. We used to bake it in cake moulds, 
and sometimes serve it with sauce as com pound 
pudding; more in fun than from any necessities of 
the case. It can be sliced thin like cake, and used 
in many ways : 



S99, St. Charles Oom Brecui. 



1 pound of white com meal (not quite a quart). 
4 ounces of fresh butter, melted (sise of two eggs). 
1 pint of boiling water. 
1 pint of cold milk. 
4 eggs. 1 level teaspoonfUl salt. 
1 teaspoonftxl of wholesome, home-made baking 
powder. 



Ibtf 



THE AMBBICAK PASTBT COOK. 



Pour the boiling water into the meal, wetting and 
scalding it all. Then add the melted butter, salt and 
milk, and then the eggs. Put the baking pan in the 
oyen tu get hot, without greasing it. Add the pow- 
der to the batter ; beat up with the large wire egg- 
whisk, then pour it into the pan. The batter is as 
thin as for batter cakes. IF the pan is hissing hot 
it never sticks, and there is no discoloration of burnt 
grease. This bread should be about an inch and a 
half deep in the pan, and bake half an hour or more. 
The sooner the top crust is formed the better, after 
that it needs to bake slowly. 

This, when done, is, of course, only com bread, 
but it has the peculiar characteristic, that everybody 
likes it. But pastry cooks, generally, <<hate to make 
it." It is a little hard to bake just right. For an- 
other sort, not too rich nor good for human nature's 
daily food, we have the reguhir stand-by — ^the com- 
mon hotel com bread, which may be good or other- 
wise, according to the skill of the maker. 



OS(3. Comznon Oom Bread. 



1 pound of white oom meal. 
8 ounces of melted lard (2 large basting-spoon- 
fUls). 

1 pint of boiling water. 

f pint of cold water or milk. 

2 eggs. 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 small teaspoonful of home-made baking powder. 

Scald about two-thirds of the meal with the boiling 
water, leaving the rest at the side of the pan to be 
stirred in with the other ingredients. Beat the 
powder in last, and bake as directed for the other 
kind. 

Now if com meal was always alike there would be 
no more to be said. But here is where the genius 
for making corn bread comes in. Both of these sorts 
should have a smooth crust rounded over like a good 
pound cake. The particular point is the scalding of 
the meal, and that varies according as the meal 
is fine or coarse ground. . I have known some few 
neophytes who saw into the deepest depths of this 
profound matter at the first glance, but others, seem- 
ingly as intelligent, would slip up every time a dif- 
ferent grade of meal came in hand. Sometimes the 
crust would rise and crack open forty ways, like a 
map of the B.ocky Mountains, and the bread would 
fall to pieces. That was because the meal was coarse 
and not sufficiently scalded, or not mixed thin 
enough Sometimes the bread would rise at first, 
but then cave in, all but the edges, like a pond gone 
dry, and cut like mush. That was because the meal 
was fine ground, and would not bear scalding much. 
White meal coarsely ground is the best. Some few 
peopU think they like yellow meal, but as surely as 
it is put to the test in hotel cookery the demand both 
for bread and mush falls off, and both are soon en- 
tirely neglected And yellow meal, for some reason, 



soon acquires a bitter, musty taste, which may haw 
as much to do with the small liking there is forcorm 
meal preparations as any other reason.

Oom Gems. 



Corn gems were instituted to meet the grave emer- 
gency that arises when more than four persons in 
one house want a comer piece of com bread. Their 
other use is for com bread in individual style. 

There is no need of special receipts, as both of the 
com bread mixtures already given are first rate. 
baked in gem pans. The richest, for individual 
loaves, should be baked in deep round pans. The 
people who call for comer pieces like the other, baked 
thin, to be nearly all crust. The gems should be 
finesh baked, every half-hour, served hot and not 
sweated in the pans.

The very best are made with yeast, but these are 
very good and can be made on shortest notice. 
** Whoe'er rejects them must be hard to please. 

And ripe for treasons, stratagems and spoils." 
1 pound of white commeal (not quite a quart). 
4 ounces of fresh butter, lard, or both mixed. 

1 pint of boiling water. 

1} pints of cold milk (3 cups). 
Half pound of flour. Salt. 
Yolks, only, of 4 eggs. ' 

2 small teaspoonfuls of baking powdej. 

Put the shortening in a saucepan with the water, 
boil, and scald the meal with them. Add the salt, 
then the milk and flour alternately, then the yolks, 
and lastly the powder beaten in well with the wire 
egg-whisk. 

Bake in greased muffin rings, 10 or 15 minutes, in 
a hot oven. Serve hot. 

The batter must be thin to make good muffins. 
Make the pan hot on which the rings are placed, be- 
fore filling, to prevent running under ; otherwise use 
rings with bottoms. 

In daily practice we learn short ways to work, 
with fewest vessels. When the object is to thoroughly 
scald the meal, it is not best to put the unmelted 
shortening with it first, but the way indicated above 
is good for all kinds of com breads. The milk is 
necessary to give good color in baking.

Tortillas. 



Now that direct trade between Chicago and Old 
Mexico is about to be opened, it might be as well to 
pay a little attention to Mexican preferences, too 

How romantic are all the words that come straying 
among us from that land of the sun I And how all 
the Mexican story-writers, from Captain Mayne 
Reid down, have revelled and gloried in the power

these sonoroas terms gave them over the imagination 
of their bewildered Northern readers ! Tarantula, 
arroya, caballero, ranchero, hacienda, cuisiniero, tor 
tilla I It was always the tortilla that crowned the 
closing day. The tempting tortilla ; the sweet, the 
delicious tortilla. 

But the story-writer has yet to be bom with self- 
denial enough to drop his romance and tell his won- 
dering readers what the tortilla is. 

Once I became acquainted with a Mexican youUif 
who was a native of the ancient city of the Montezu- 
mas. There was poetry in his name. It was Man- 
uel de Carralho. There was poetry in his face, for 
he had mebuicholy eyes and a sentimental mous- 
tache. His ancestors were Dons, but he, alas, was 
but valet to an English tourist. He had been through 
all the gay capitals of the Old World, yet nothing 
had ever prevailed to chase the cynical expression 
from his lips, or withdraw his thoughts from the 
home of his early days. 

And thenjie came to a noted pleasure resort that 
was frequented by wealthy Southern people. And 
on going into the bakery one day, he saw a griddle 
full of something that caused him to stop, open- 
mouthed, with delighted surprise ; and as soon as he 
was sure he could believe his eyes he struck an atti- 
tude, clasped his hands and shouted in ecstacy : 
"Ha, ha!— Tor— theel— as!" So at last Manuel 
was happy. And this is how the tortillas were 
made: 



Mezioan Tortdllajs. 

Mix a quart of white corn meal with boiling water 
enough to barely wet it, and cold water after that to 
make it like thin mush. Add a teaspoonAil of salt. 
Drop large spoonfUls on the hot griddle, and spread 
them out to form thin cakes. 

"But," you say, "your toritUas are nothing but 
the Southern hoe cakes." Yes, that's what they are. 
But many people like hoe cakes better if they are 
shortened a little.

:oe Oakes, or Oom Baxmooks. 



2 pounds of white corn meal. 

Half pound of lard. 

1 teaspoonftil of salt. 

Put the lard in the middle of the meal with the 
salt, and pour in a little boiling water to melt it. 
Then add cold water or milk to make like thin mush. 
Bake on a griddle or "hoe," placing the dough with 
a spoon and flattening out thin. 



"Why cannot we have this?" 
"You can have it." 

"What IS it folded 80 nicely in a napkin? Looks 
likv brown bread." 
"It is brown bread." 



"And you have brown bread plenty on hand all 
the time?" 

"0, but this is not bakers' Boston brown ; this is 
delicious." 

That was said before the Chicago lire. 0, incom- 
prehensible hotel boarders who live always on the £fit 
of the land and tire of it ! But in a well-regulated 
hotel you can have anything. This is one of the va 
rieties of bread made principally of corn meal which 
the Boston writer before quoted, had in mind : 

"On account of its lack of gluten, Indian meal is 
not well adapted for making bread without a slight 
admixture of wheat or rye flour." 

That is the eastern idea, not the southern or west- 
ern. 

This kind of bread is very It con- 

tains no shortening, except what may be conveyed 
by rich buttermilk, when that can be had instead of 
baking powder, and is probably very healthful eaten 
cold. Reckless inhabitants of the hotel world, gen- 
erally prefer to eat it right away quick while it is 
hot. And still very few deaths occur. 



Steamed,

2 pounds of com meal. 

1 quart of boiling water. 

Half pint of re-boiled, black molasses (coffee cup 
full). 

H pints of cold milk. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

4 heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

1 pound of graham flour. 

1 pound of white flour. 

Pour the water boiling into the meal and stir; then 
mix in the molasses and the other ingredients in the 
order as written — the powder in the flour — and stir 
up thoroughly. It makes a stiff batter, too soft to be 
handled. Put it in two pails with tight-fitting lids 
and steam ft*om 4 to 6 hours, then bake a short time 
to form a crust. The pails should be made for the 
purpose, of best stovepipe iron, a trifle wider at top 
than at bottom. Brush a little lard over the insides 
and then wipe it off thoroughly before putting in the 
dou|^, and there will be no stains on the crust when 
done. Where there is a steam chest to the range, over 
which vegetables are steamed, the pails can be set in- 
side in the water, and then there is nothing in the 
bread line more easily made than this. Makes 8 
pounds of bread ; cuts into about 4 dozen slices. 
Enough for the average orders of 75 people for one 
meal, there being other kinds of bread. But if yon 
have had it talked about all through the house 40 
people will get away with this much easily. Such is 
the effect of advertising. Should the bread cut sticky, 
use a little less liquid in mixing next time.

dings of Indian meal, of different degrees, and this 
following will,* probably, by good judges, be consid- 
ered the best. 

"Tell that cook," said a healthy St Louis capUin, 
his boat then laid up in the ice, *'to make this once 
more and let me know when, and then he may go to 
heaTen." 

Most of us have heard something like that in a 
sarcastic mood, but this was a jolly ban vtoanl, and 
was being helped the second time, so before "that 
cook" started to heaven, I preyailed upon him to 
abstract and perfect out of the chaos of his guess- 
work the following receipt. 



090. Mohawk Puddizicr- 

2 quarts of milk. 
10 ounces of com meaL 

4 ounces of f^h butter. 

6 ounces of rebelled black molasBas. 

5 whole eggs. 

6 yolks. 

1 large lemon. 

Pinch of salt. 

Make mush in the usual way by bringing the nulk 
to a boil, sprinkling in the meal and beating at the 
same time with egg whisk to prevent lumps. Stir 
over a fire a few minutes ; then put on a tight lid to 
keep the steam in ; push the saucepan to the back of 
the range and let the mush remain at cooking heat 
without burning, for two hours or more. Then turn 
it out into a pan and mix in the other ingredients — 
the eggs beaten light — ^the rind of the lemon grated 
and the juice squeezed in. Bake about half an 
hour, or till the egg in it is fiurly set, and no longer. 

This makes about 3 quarts of pudding ; enough 
for the average orders of 60 persons. It can be 
baked in fluted pudding moulds, and turned out 
whole if handled carefully, where so required, or else 
in two small pans well buttered. 

A mild, neutral sauce is best with this. If hot 
sweetened cream cannot be had try the following, 
which is as ornamental as useful.

Nutmeg extract to flavor. 

Boil the water in a bright saucepan. Mix the 
starch in the sugar dry, and rapidly stir them in. 
When it has boiled up, beat in the butter. Pour a 
little sauce to the yolks in a cup ; beat, then mix all 
together. Just before it begins to boil remove it from 
the fire, taking care the yolks do not curdle with too 
much cooking.

Brown Indian Souffle. 



Perhaps not the connoisseur's pudding, but 
thought by many to have less style and more real 
comfort in it than any other. It is something of a 
curiosity for its puify lightness, and should be served 
whole in that condition as soon as done, or else dish 
it 'up, if you wish to secure for the bubble reputation^ 
out of the oven's mouth. 

You will never know it at its best, unless you can 
procure the old-fashioned, thick, black molasses. 

8 pints of water. 
12 ounces of com meal. 

1 pound of re-boUed black molasses. 

8 ounces of butter. 

8 eggs. 

No salt needed but what is in the butter, and take 
care that it has not too much. 

Make mush by sprinkling the dry meal into the 
boiling water, and beating at the same time with the 
^;g whisk. When it has boiled a mijiute or two put 
in the butter and molasses, stir together, put on the 
lid and push the saucepan to the back of the range 
to simmer about an hour. It is not very apt to bum. 
Then turn the mixture into a pan, beat the 8 eggs a 
little and gradually stir them in. 

Bake in a slow oven about 45 minutes. Makes 
about 2^ quarts. 

Eat hot with cream, or, fiuling that, make this 
sauoe, which will relieve its want of color.

Mix the sugar, grated rind and starch together dry; 
stir them into the boiling water ; add the lemon juice 
and butter, and when it boils again pour in the beat- 
en yolks quickly and beat well. As soon as the eggs 
begin to thicken take the sauce firom the fire and

written— -the rinds of the lemons grated and juice 
squeezed in, and eggs all beaten light together. 
Dust the fruit with a small cup of flour. Steam in

plum pudding.

Ixidian Plum Pudding Baked. 



The same as the preceding, except that chopped 
apples can be used instead of currants, or in addi- 
tion to them, which would make the steamed pud- 
ding too soft. Spices can be added at option. May 
be baked in deep ornamental moulds, well buttered 
and dusted with flour, and serred with burning 
brandy sauce. Will bake in half the time required 
for steaming. 



Fatty Bread euid Buttermilk. 



This entree never appeared on any biU-of-fiure. It 
is hoped that nobody will make it, it might be 
thought too rich for good health. It is put in here 
merely in an historical sort of way, because it is 
strictly American and is not on record in any of the 
French books. To be still more precise, it is an in- 
stitution of Blackyille, and the people who believed 
in It had broad shiny &ces and did not know a 
thing about dyspepsia. Although again it is hoped 
nobody will ever make anything so greasy anymore, 
it has to be recorded that the boys who did not be- 
long in Blackville had a wonderftil knack of coming 
home from squirrel shooting at sundown, just at the 
most favorable time for snatching a portion of this 
peculiar feast; to which the Blackville people did not 
welcome them, and always declared it tasted better 
than buttemuta There are many Blackvilles in the 
United States, and the one where this dish came 
nearest bemg named in French was on Bayou Black, 
not very far from New Orleans, but you could not 
translate the French spoken there, and, moreover, 
calabashes AiU of sugar cane juice fh>m the nulls 



took the place of buttermilk, and it was not quite th« 
same thing. But there was a Blackville near that 
large hotel at White Sulphur Springs, and Black- 
ville near Brownsville, on Blackwater river, at the 
Sweet Springs in Missouri. 

It was only in the flush times of hog killing that 
Blackville could indulge in this luxury ; but if com- 
pany was expected from the opposition village, what- 
ever its name was, perhaps the young Blackvillans 
with their 'possum dogs would pass a whole night in 
the woods and Ml any number of trees till they had 
'possums enough. Because you can't make fatty 
bread without fat, and 'possum's fat does very well. 

Somebody has to chum in the morning and take 
the buttermilk down to the spring house to become 
cool. The rest of it is very simple : 

1 pound of com meal. 

i pound of lard or 'possum fkt. 

Salt. 

Pour the lard, melted, into the meal, and stir in 
enough cold water to make it like thin mush. 

Spread in thin cakes on the hot stove lid, and 
when fried on one side turn them over. . If you 
have no stove, but only a fireplace that takes in half 
a hickory tree trank at a time, rake out some coals 
and bake the cakes in a spider. 

To be eaten hot, with cold buttermilk. 



In extreme contrast to the foregoing is the White- 
ville variety of breai. 



68e. 



Oom Dodgers. 



The ordinary dinner bread of the South. 

Take the required quantity of com meal, say a 
quart, and stir it up with cold water enough to make 
it like thick mush, just so that it can be shaped. 
Make it with hand or spoon, in shapes like goose 
eggs, and place them almost touching in a baking 
pan that is kept hot on top of the range while they 
are being placed. Bake in a hot oven. 

It is usually insisted upon that no salt shall be put 
into this kind. Serve hot. 

Simple as this is, some persons can make it twice 
as palatable as others. One requirement is to make 
the meal take up- all the water it will carry without 
losing shape. Another is to bake it in a very hot 
oven, so that it will become brown without being too 
dry and hard. 

While everybody will agree that there must be a 
perfection point for every common article, beyond 
which it cannot be improved, it is hardly likely 
that anyone will take the trouble to scald the meal 
for batter cakes. There is not time for all these 
little things in hotd business, and yet it has to be 
set down that therein lies the point that beats com- 
mon work The following will do without:

THB AMBBIOAK PA8TBT COOK. 



63T. Ck>m Batter Oakes. 



1 pound of white com meal. 
i pound of flour. 

8 ounces of melted lard (} cup). 

2 eggs. A little salt. 

1 quart of milk or water. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Mix gradually to avoid having lumps in the bat- 
ter, add the lard, melted, and the powder last. If 
no milk, a spoonful of syrup is required to give col- 
or. But sometimes you have to work for thorough 
philomaizians who love com for itself alone and do 
not want any flour in theirs. In that case you must 
pcald the meal.

Ck>m Batter Oakes 'Without Flour. 



1} pounds of com meal. 

1 quart of water or milk. 

4 ounces of lard. 

4 eggs. Salt. 

1 teaspoonftil of baking powder. 

Scald the meal with half the water, and mix up 
the same as if for com bread. 

In all the preceding receipts where baking pow- 
der is directed to be used, it is to be understood that 
buttermilk and soda will do as well, if the butter, 
milk be genuine, not watered, and sour enough to 
counteract a small teaspoonful of soda to the pint. 

030. Theory and Practice. 

Since it has become the very general custom to eat 
one or other of the several varieties of mush as a first 
course at breakfast and supper, the best methods of 
preparing the simple dish so as to have it in perfec- 
tion can no longer be considered a matter too trifling 
for any first-rate cook's attention. Besides, what- 
ever of consequence mush may lack in the instance, 
it gains through diffusion, for thousands of cooks are 
wanted to make good mush for every one that is re- 
quired to prepare costly and omamental dinners; so, 
you see, from the utility point of view, well-cooked 
mush is a thousand times better than well cooked 
truffles. And if that reads like a riddle it will have 
to go, for there is no room here to straighten it out. 

When a lot of com meal is piled into a saucepan 
of water, not half enough for so much meal, and im- 
patiently stirred up and served ten minutes afterward, 
that is not mush. I don't know what it is. There is 
no name for it. But yet there are people so possessed 
with the idea that mush can never be cooked enough, 
that they become crotchety, one might almost say 
fanatical, in pursuing the other extreme. 

As we may have to go to the Germans for instruc- 
tion in German dishes, to the French when the mat- 
ter is French, and to the English when the excellence 
is reputedly theirs, perhaps no excuse is needed for 
going often to the Southern States, even to plantation 
life for instances, whilst American com meal has the 



front place. Down in that land of large estates and 
extensive operations, there used to be places where 
frt>m year's end to year's end the mush cauldron 
never stopped boiling, except as it was emptied and 
replenished once in every twenty-four hours, that 
being the time considered necessary for the meal to 
cook before it cduld become wholesome food for the 
scores of laborers whose principal food it was. These 
kettles, some with mush and some with hominy, 
hung in huge fireplaces, and were tended by old 
crones,with stirring pfKldles like boat oars, day and 
night, like the witches in Macbeth with their <*bub- 
ble, bubble, toil and trouble ; fire bum and cauldron 
bubble." How should we like to make mush for the 
folks that way ? There are a good many degrees b^ 
tween ten-minute mush and twenty-four hour mush, 
and as to the stirring there are very few hotels where 
even ten minutes can be bestowed upon that part 
asa regular thing. Fortunately there is little need 
of it. Heat and steam are restless enough to keep up 
a very fiur bubble of themselves without much manual 
labor. It seems to be with com meal as with rice, 
it will take up a certain amount of water and no 
more. Ten ounces of rice will absorb a quart of wa- 
ter and all the water that is added beyond that only 
tends to separate the particles and make a blue 
gruel. Five ounces of com meal will do the same as 
the ten ounces of rice, absorb a quart of water and 
no more. With a much less proportion of water the 
meal can never be well cooked, because the finer 
particles take up the water first and the course 
gnuns always must remain raw and hard, no matter 
how long on the fire. Rice will cook well done in 
three-quarters of an hour; com meal requires about 
three hours to reach the same point, although it may 
be passibly good after only one or two hours boil- 
ing. 

To reduce the time of cooking some people steep 
the meal in water several hours before. There is 
nothing to be said against tliis except that it is likelier 
to be forgot or neglected than remembered and be- 
comes a cause of Irregularity under the usual hotel 
conditions.

Oom Meal Mush. 



2 quarts of water. 
10 ounces of white com meal. 

1 rounded tablespoonful of salt. 

Use a flat-bottomed, bright iron sauoepaiL Bnuh 
the inside with the least possible amount of motted 
lard. This reduces the tendency to bum and les- 
sens the waste. Put the salt in the water, boil, and 
sprinkle the dry meal in with one hand while yon 
beat with the large wire egg-whisk in the other, till 
all is in and there are no lumps to be seen. Put on 
the lid, push the saucepan to the back of the range 
and let it simmer with the steam shut im tar tiuee 
hours.

Then turn it out and keep it hot in a bright sink 
in the steam chest. 

Where the mush has to be made on a cook-stove, 
a cast pot with feet, to raise the bottom an inch fVom 
the fire, is best. 

You will have the same measure of made mush as 
you had water at first ; four quarts of water and 
twenty ounces of meal producing one gallon. 

Double the quantity required for one meal should 
be made and half put away to become cold to fry. 
For this purpose rery slightly grease a bright tin 
pan, press the mush evenly into it, and slightly 
brush over with a brush dipped in melted lard again. 
No matter how little the grease, it prevents the for- 
mation of a crust by drying on top. Warm the pan 
a few seconds and the mush, when cold, will turn 
out without trouble. 

Each quart of cold mush will cut into about ten 
blocks or slices for frying.

Fried mufih is one of the things, as fried potatoes 
is another, that has a telling effect in giving the im- 
pression of excellence or otherwise of the hotel table. 
That indefinite something so often mentioned, called 
excellence of cutnne, is made up of hundreds of such 
trifles as properly fried mush. 

Recently a correspondent of a leading New York 
newspaper, and whose letter in part was reprinted 
in the Repobteb, had occasion to comment upon a 
break^ist at one of the famous hotels of Boston, and 
went into well trained ecstacies over the simple per- 
fection of it all. ^'0, the ineffable cumne!'* was the 
exclamation, and of course it was a woman writing, 
for men never think of original expressions ; one 
says ''the cooking was tip top," and all the succeed- 
ing thousands say the same words. Well, there was 
no mention of fried mush, but there was a hint of 
golden-hued cutlets — ^breaded cutlets — and the same 
conditions and effects pertain to both articles. 

There was an intimation of crisp salad, and deli- 
cately browned rolls and perfect, fresh butter. When, 
in any case, you are curious to know "upon what 
meat doth this our Caesar feed?" you may be sure 
that it is nothing more than you yourself can buy in 
the market, and at the best of breakfasts the cups 
are not so liable to be "filled with the nectar that 
Jupiter sips,' as with good coffee and chocolate. The 
guests prefer them. 

This tempting-looking fried mush — and breaded 
cutlets, too— cannot be had, as a rule to be depend- 
ed on, unless lard, good fresh lard, can be afforded 
for the frying. One thing essential to the houses of 
ineffable eumne, is to be always excellent, and not 
good for one observer and indifferent for the next. 
But cheap, home-saved material, if good sometimes, 
always carries a proviso. Meat drippings and soup 
stock toppings ar^ 'r*>*>d in a comparative sense, but 



are apt to make the fries dark colored. Also, these 
articles cannot be had perfect unless cracker meal 
can be afforded to bread them with. Stale bread 
dried and crushed and sifted is next best ; com 
meal for breading is the worst of all. But powdered 
bread produces a reddish brown, and when dripping 
for f^ing is used with it, the mush often looks more 
like smoked meat. I do not wish to be understood 
as advocating expensive ways. All the cheap ways 
are to be given in these columns ; ways of cooking 
without eggs, without cream, or milk, or butter, 
without baking powder ; and it will not have to be 
said the articles so made are as good as the best, only 
that they are good enough ; but the opportunity is 
here improved of showing -by one instance out of 
hundred8> how some tables are and must be better 
than the rest, and why people cannot have four dollar 
ikre for three dollars, nor three dollar fkre for^ two. 
When breaded articles like fried mush are made so 
good with crushed bread crumbs and melit fat ftrom 
the roasting pans that nobody observes any inferi- 
ority, the credit is wholly due to the skill and care- 
ftilness of the cook. Com meal for breading has such 
a bad appearance that it ought to be counted out. 
People who like the taste of fried meal, and will have 
even oysters breaded with it, have to forego the 
neatness and color that the other methods give. 

One of our French preceptors gives us a homily 
on frying, put in the readable form of a Count So- 
and-so lecturing his cook, who, on the occasion of a 
dinner to invited guests, had spoiled a choice fish 
through putting it into lard (oroil) not hot enough. The 
gist of it is, that if you put the breaded article into 
lard not hot enough to immediately cook the outside, 
the breading washes off, the juices of the fish or meat 
ooze out, and these cannot be browned at all without 
being entirely dried out. With an article so largely 
made up of water as mush, it is still more necessary 
to have the outside coat of egg and crumbs instantly 
set, otherwise it will merely melt away and be lost 



049. Fried Mush, Breaded. 



Take the pan of cold boiled mush, prepared as al- 
ready described, and having slightly warmed the 
bottom, turn it upside down on a clean paste-board, 
kept for the purpose. Cut the mush into blocks, 
square or diamond-shaped, or else into slices or f^uu 
cy forms, according to the use intended. 

For every quart of mush one egg is required, to be 
beaten up with an equal amount of water. 

Roll the pieces in this, and then in the meal mada 
by pounding and sifting crackers. 

Have a saucepan half fUU of lard made hot 
enough to hiss loudly when a drop of water touches 
it, but yet not smoking. Drop in the mush a few 
pieces at a time; f^ them yellow-brown — about 
ten minutes — ^then place them in a colander set 
in a pan, and in a hot place, to drain and dry before 
serving.

THB AKBBIOAH PA8TBT CCOK. 



Wonder by what miachanoe in the distribution of 
names, it happened that we drew mush from Gfer- 
man mu$, when the other corn-raising peoples nearly 
all drew Latin polenta ? 

For it is not to be supposed that we have the monop 
olyof mush, excepting the poor word itself. That, in- 
deed, does not seem to be known eyen to the English 
as a household word, for our mush, if they take it 
as an experiment, they call maixe porridge, our oat- 
meal mush is the Scotch oatmeal porridge, our 
cracked-wheat mush is the English frumenty, and 
mush they will not say at all. 

France, which raises annually thirty million bush, 
els of com, makes mush and mush puddings, but 
calls mush polenta. 

The term is specially applied to pudding made of 
the meal of chestnuts, the same that, possibly. Count 
Nesselrode was fond of, for, improved to a superlative 
degree, we now find a pudding of chestnuts called 
Nesselrode pudding ; but the Italian polenta, a com 
meal pudding, is also made in France, and polenta 
tor mush has a general application. Portugal raises 
fifteen million bushels of com, and makes com food, 
and there it is not prosaic mush but musical polenta. 
Italy exceeds them all, raises forty-five million bush- 
els, makes mush, and calls it polenta. Also, BriUat-Sa- 
▼arin, enumerating the various articles contributed 
by different countries to make a perfect euirine, says 
that Italy sends ^o^ta Uqueuers, and in the want of 
better knowledge, the supposition is unavoidable that 
he meant Italian com whisky or its compounds. 
Even our neighbor, Brasil, raising and using large 
amounts of com does not call mush our tasteless 
way, but speaking Portugese no doubt sups on mel- 
lifluous polenta. 

Now mush does well enough for every day use, 
but we want something for Sunday and company 
times, and mush, ' look at it any way you please, is 
positively too homely and humble to be elevated to 
any conspicuous position. The article mush is wanted 
to go to table with some very nice entrees ; it is 
pleasant to the sight and good for food, and can be 
cut handsomely and browned prettily and set up or- 
namentally, and is good for canapes Audfleuronst and 
eroustadet; but the word mush will never fit in 
gracefully where mush ought to be; it will not har- 
monize with the grand surroundings of notable open- 
ing days and splendid banquets at gilt-edged hotels; 
it will hardly be admitted to the finest bills of fare, 
to be printed in gold on satin, with borders of Jap- 
anese mocking-birds and garlands of roses from 
Bendemere's Stream, now will it? But you cannot 
say the same of polenta, the difference is immense. 

Polenta is Italian, and used to mocking-birds and 
roses and all that. Mush is Cinderella, but polenta 
is Cinderella changed to the princess. If this differ- 
ence is not already apparent, let us put it to the test. 
You cannot imagine mush being introduced with pro- 



priety into any line of tragic or heroic verse, but , 
polenta can be, and can hold its own. Take this ex- 
ample: 

*'0, Romeo, Romeo I wherefore art thou Romeo?" 
— ^instead of a member of some other family — and it 
will be seen that without the least loss of dignity our 
impassioned Juliet might shout : 

"0 Polenta, Polenta I wherefore art thou Po- 
lenta ?* * — instead of bread-crumbed trout. With due 
care taken to give the true lisp to the «t" in polenta, 
as it would be heard in some old moss-grown inn in 
Granada, under the shadow of the Alhambra or any 
other Castle in Spain, the paraphrase possesses a 
depth of plaintive passion that would set the mock 
heroics which do so murder the original at defiance. 
And yet polenta is mush, but note the difference : 

«0 Mush, Mush I wherefore art thou Mush?"— 
instead of Polenta. 

No use ; even capitals do not help it — ^will not 
ring in right at all, but you immediately think of 
Bottom, the weaver, and Starveling, his mate, and 
"0 Bottom, Bottom I thou art translated I" 

This is an idle fhncy, but it is serious, too, for we 
want to put mush, at least fried mush, on the finest 
bills of fiune that are gotten up— bills for the Oapa- 
lets and Montagus, stately as Romeo, dainty as Ju- 
liet, if not BO tragical. Some of the finest bills of 
fkre extant have, for a dainty dish, «* Marrow on 
Toast." Mush might well take the toast's place, 
yet, it is hard to say why, <<Marrow on Mush" 
does not seem so stylish. ''Border of Mush, Filled" 
with something, would not cut as grand a figure 
among the entrees as "Bordeur de Polenta Oamiei" 
now would it ? 

Speaking of Juliet, isn't it Juliet who says: 
"That, which we call a rose. 
By any other name would smell as sweet?" 

Literally taken, millions have agreed to that, 
but there is something behind the literal ; words are 
beguiling. 

''Who iB*t," quoth he, "that there reposes, 
Upon yon bank of summer roses?" 

Here the idea conveyed by reposes on roses is so 
pleasant that you forget about the probable thorns 
and go on reading to see what other pleasant things 
there are, and it is the same with eating as with 
reposing. Let a person spend a season at some de- 
lightful winter resort and write home about the "ex- 
quisite mush," and all the people written to would 
surely laugh. But let it be the other case, and let 
the expression be "0, the divine polenta," and they 
would no more laugh than they would at the di- 
vine Piccolomini or the divine Celestina, but would 
go on reading to see what other good things you 
were having, and would forget about the probable 
cheapness of polenta, which would be the thorn in 
this case. Thus, it is seen, mush has a very bad case, 
and it is hard to see what is to be done about it 
Perhaps somebody will help out this philological 
difficulty, and we will go right along with our ra- 
ceipts.

Polenta Frite. 



Fiied mufih can be used togoodadTanUgeinmany 
diBhes that usuallj have toast, or fried bread or fried 
potato garnishes, but in the guileless form of the com- 
mon break&st fried mush, it is open to the same ob- 
jection thai Brillat-SaTarin brings against the po- 
tato; he says: **I never take any. I think nothing 
of the potato unless as a stop-gap in times of great 
scarcity. It is, to my taste, most insipid." There- 
fore resort should be had to the g^tronome's ex- 
pedient in many similar cases; slice the mush thin, 
cut the shapes small, and mix minced cheese with 
the cracker meal to bread it with. The proportion 
of cheese is about one cupful, finely Qiinced, to three 
cupfuls of cracker meal, but it must depend upon the 
quality of the cheese. Needs extra care in frying, 
as it soon acquires a deep color. 



644. Polenta, a 1' Italienne. 



A cake of buttered mush, with cheese baked on 
the top. 

1 quart of water. 

6 ounces of yellow com meaL 

2 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of cheese, minced. 

Level teaspoonful of salt and pepper mixed. 

Half cupftil of cracker meal. 

Brush the inside of a small saucepan slightly with 
melted butter, and make mush with the water and 
meal in the usual way, letting it cook with a lid on, 
in its own steam, on the ftirthest comer of the range, 
about 2 hours. Then stir in half the butter and the 
pepper and salt. ' It should be a stiff, well-cooked 
mush. Spread the other ounce of butter on the 
baking pan bottom — a 2 qt., bright, shallow 
milk-pan is best — sift half the cracker meal 
on that, then place the mush by spoonfUls so as to 
smooth it over at last without disturbing the under 
crust. When leveled over, strew on the minced 
cheese, sift rest of cracker meal on top, and bake in 
a brisk oven half an hour, or till nicely browned at 
top and bottom. This is a good dish for lunch. May 
be served like macaroni and cheese, or macaroni 
cake. Is best baked en caiate^ that is, in little paper 
cases. 

When the cheese furnished is too dry to melt in 
the oven, moisten the top with the back of a spoon 
dipped in melted butter. When too rich and melt- 
ing, use less, and more cracker meal. 



045. 



To Fry -Mush "Without EfiTfiTS. 



Mix flour and water together to make thickening 
of the consistency of cream, without lumps. Roll 
the pieces of mush in it instead of egg and water, 
then in ci'acker meal, or bread crumbs, and fry in 
fthe usual way. A half cup of water or milk to two 



heaping tablespoontVils of flour makes it. Milk gives 
the better color. The f^ng grease has to be hotter 
and fewer pieces must be put in at once to make thii 
way nearly as good as the other. It answen very 
well, also, to roll the mush in rich milk without 
floor. 



64e. 



Mush Sautes. 



Sautes is tauteedf in meaning, according to Eng- 
lish terminations, and that means fried in a common 
frying-pan like fHed eggs, etc. The French or prop- 
er frying requires a quantity of hot fat or oil, as in- 
dicated in the preceding directions for fried mush. 

The word Sautee is perpetually appearing in hotel 
bills of fikre, but the people to whom it conveys any 
meaning are extremely few. It seems to be usually 
guessed to mean sauce. As it is a technical term, a 
person might read French a long time without meet- . 
ing with it elsewhere than at table. There is suffi- 
cient reason for its use, seeing that no other word ex- 
presses the same thing correctly. 

To saute mush, cut it in slices not over half an 
inch thick, and flour them all over. Place a spoon- 
ful of lard, clarified butter or clarified meat fat, in 
the f^ng pan, and when hot put in two or three 
slices, not near enough to touch. Brown it quickly, 
and turn over with an egg slice. Is only good when 
fried as wanted and served immediately. 



There is still another variety of mush, and wheth- 
er we make use of the knowledge or not, the neces- 
sity of at least being posted on them all was well ex- 
emplified in the luck of a certain man fh>m Boston. 
He came fVom one of the best hotels of that city, and 
obtained a good position in St. Louis. What he 
claimed to have been, or what he had been in the 
famous Boston house, is neither here nor there, but 
it was evident that his had been only one particular 
line of duty, for, unexcelled in some things, there 
were other smaller matters that baffled his efforts, 
and one of these was fried mush. He knew of but 
one kind, and that was fried mush balls, which, you 
see, was a great misfortune, considering that he was 
head cook of a large hotel, having assistants who did 
not think it best to do otherwise than as he directed. 
So mush balls they made and made them good, very 
likely, or else the demand was small and the style 
unnoticed, for that way lasted quite a while. But 
presently evil days came, and brought with them 
some people of grand import, who had been board- 
ing at the Hotel Terrible, up the avenue. 

They came in a huff, and soon began to sniff, and 
looking about for inferiorities, observed the fried 
mush balls. Then they pulled them apart, analyzed 
them, condemned them. If there was anything they 
did love, it was good fried mush ; but these mush 
balls were simply atrocious. They demanded what 
they were pleased to term the genuine article. But 
they might as well have called spirits from the vasty 



lo4 



THE AMERICAN PASTBT COOK. 



deep, that would not come when they did call them, 
for neither they themselves nor anybody else could 
tell what difference of process was required. So dis- 
satisfaction grew up on both sides. It took an earth, 
quake to "roll" the cooks out of their kitchens at 
Pompeii, and required an eruption of Yesuvius to 
make the bakers forget their bread in their ovens at 
Herculaneum, but that was in grander times than 
these, and it is not exceeding the truth to say that 
this sad fugitive from the modem Athens was im. 
pelled to sever his connection through no greater 
reason than the vacuity of his perceptions of- the in- 
herent possibilities of fried mush. Perhaps you 
think that after he was gone all was peace, and joy, 
and love, but it was not. His successor's mush was 

orthodox and irreproachable, but 

Well, there were some old habitues who had oon- 
oeived an affection for the other kind, they did not 
know what made the difference, but there was a 
solid sweetness in the other that the new kind did 
not possess. The new cook did not understand it 
either, for he only knew one way ; so they split the 
slices and double breaded them, and tried to make 
believe, and worried along, and I think they are all 
dead by this time and out of their troubles, but if 
ever you get into such a place after learning the fol- 
lowing receipt, you will know what they want, bet- 
ter than they know themselves. 



64T. 

Fried Mush Balls, or Fried Pone. 



1 pound of com meal. 

1 pint of boiling water. 

4 iablespoonfuls of melted lard. 

1 egg. i cup cold water. Salt. 

Scald the meal with the boiling water ; add the 
rest of the ingredients; flour your hands; make 
round balls, and fry in a saucepan of hot lard. They 
require long cooking. 



No doubt it could be easily demonstrated that four 
cooks in a hotel kitchen accomplish more in the culi- 
nary line than do forty domes ic cooks in twenty pri- 
vate houses. No particular credit to the hotel cooks, 
but it is owing to the larger scale and system of their 
work, the greater capacities of their ranges and uten- 
sils, the labor-saving conveniences, water and drain- 
age arrangements, and the larger quantities handled. 
It takes but little longer to cook five pounds than one, 
scarcely more trouble to make a gallon of soup for 
twenty persons than a quart for a family. But the 
emergencies are many, too. There has to be a drop-- 
ping off and leaving out of many long and tedious 
processes. That which cannot be made in short time, 
is most likely no^ to be made at all, or else attempted 
and spoiled. 

There are printed directions for numerous articles 
apparently desirable, that must be constantly stirred 
or otherwise worked one or two hours. To follow 



such in hotel work is simply impossible, it would re- 
quire a small army of assistants. The common objeo- 
tion is valid — ''0, we can't — ^there isn't time." The 
choice, then, lies between making many cheap and 
good preparations in a half-way manner; giving them 
up entirely, or finding out the reason why of the long 
processes and getting at the same results by shorter 
methods. There will be, it is hoped, many better il- 
lustrations than this of com meal puddings, yet this 
will serve, and may the sooner establish an under- 
standing of the motive of many directions that might 
otherwise seem peculiar. It is commonly said that 
com meal puddings must bake three hours or longer, 
but in a hotel doing a healthy business it is extremely 
inconvenient to- keep one minor article, and one so 
liable to bum, in the oven for that length of time 
Fishes and meats have to go in and out, then vegeta- 
bles and pastry; three hours baking involves three 
hours watching, and the strain upon memory lest it be 
neglected. There is no need of this. The only rea- 
son for long cooking is to cook the meal thoroughly, 
and that is better done in a saucepan with a lid on in 
any out-of-the-way comer, or even in a sink in the 
steam chest. To bake a pudding longer than till the 
eggs are well set, is generally an iigury. What is at 
a certain point rich, smooth and custard-like, b^ 
comes, with longer baking, watery and inferior, 
through the curdling of the eggs, just as is seen to 
happen when a custard is allowed to boil. Cook the 
materials as much as you please before the eggs are 
put in, but very little after. 

Several puddings of com meal have already been 
described, the next is a plainer and cheaper sort. 
Not necessarily the worse for that — ^it is mere matter 
of taste.

pna and mix, throw in a teaspoonful of salt, add 
the molasses and cold water, then the yeast and 
then the two kinds of flour. Line two sheet-iron 
brown bread pails with greased paper, put in the 
dough and let rise Arom one to two hours, then 
bake or steam for five hours. If steamed, bake the 
loaves afterward long enough to form a slight crust. 
A good sort of bread is m^e as above with a 
pound of graham sifted through a eommon flour 
sieye to remove the coarse bran, and the white flour 
omitted; or with all rye flour and no graham or 
white. Care should be taken not to scald the yeast 
by adding it to the hot meal before the cold water. 
When this kind of bread is sticky when sliced it 
shows it was made up too wet. When the loaves 
come out hollow or caved in it shows too much fer- 
mentation. 

660. Bngliflh Home-Made Brown Bread. 

8 pounds of sifted graham flour. 

1 quart of warm water. 

i ounce of compressed yeast 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

By sifted graham is meant flour with the ooanest 
b^an taken out Commence 7 or 8 hours before 
time to bake. Dissolve the yeast in the water and 
mix up half the flour with it, that is '^setting 
sponge.'* Place the pan in a warm comer, to re- 
main 4 hours. Then throw in the salt, mix np to 
stiff dough, scrape out the pan and knead smooth. 
Brush over the pan with the least possible amount 
of melted lard, or lard and hot water to prevent 
sticking, put in the lump of dough and brush it 
over, and let rise 2 hours more. Then knead, make 
inte loaves, rise again and bake. 

Where potato yeast is used instead of compressed, 
take about one-fourth as much yeast as water. 

The foregoing is the kind of bread fuhionably 
served with stewed slices of fish.

firoit jellies and marmalade. 



652 b, Peaoh Butter. 

8 cupfuls of sliced peaches. 

4 cupfuls of sugar. 
2 cupfuls of water. 

The peaches need not be peeled, but should be 
rubbed in a coarse towel before slicing. 

Put the water into a kettle or bright pan; then the 
peaches; shut in the steam and let cook at the back 
of the stove.or set on bricks, for an hour or longer* 
Then add the sug<ir, and do not leave it, as it burns 
very easily, but keep stirring irith a broad wooden 
paddle while it boils one-half hour more. Keep in 
ajar in a cool place.

653. Found Oake. 

14 or 15 oanoes of sugar. 
12 oanoes of batter. 
10 eggs. 

I poand of floar. 
Warm «he batter and sugar together slightly and 

work them with a spoon till oreamj and white. Add 
the eggs 2 at a time, and then the flour in 8 or 4 
portions. Beating- the batter after all the ingredi- 
ents are in tends to make the oake fine grained. 
Pound oako shoold not be flavored. 

Pound cake, doubtless is so called, beoause it can 
be m«de with a pound of each of the ingredients. The 
10 eggs weigh a pound. But so much butter makes 
it too rich to be good eating. 

654. Found Fruit Oake. 

The staple everj day sort of plum cake. The fruit 
does not sink to the bottom in this mixture. 
14 ounces of sugar. 
14 ounces of butter.

18 ounces of flour. 
Mix the above the same as pound cake^ then add 

to it: 

2 teaspoonftils of mixed ground spioee, cinnamon, 
mace, and alspioe. 

1 lemon, grated rind, and Juice. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 pound of currants. 

8 ounoes of citron. 

Half capful of whisky (opaonal). 

Ui!e seedless raisins. Nothing is good made fhU 
of raisin seeds. Mix the fruit together and dust it 
with flour before stirring it into the batter. The 
cakes require from 1 to 1} hours to bake. 

665. Oltron Oake. 

Either of the preceding pound cake mixtures with 
1 pound of citron out in shreds and added, and a 
little lemon extract.

1 pound of citron. 

8 ouooes of almonds, blanched* 

1 tablespoonful of mixed ground spices. 

Half pint of brandy. 

1 lemon, Juice and grated rind. 



Bake in molds lined with buttered paper. Takes 
from 1 to 2 hours according to depth. This cake 
cannot be cut while fresh withont cmmbUng,- but 
becomes moister and firm with a finr days keeping. 

657. mchest Fruit Oake-Blaok Cake* 

Prepaxe the ftuit first. 
2} pounds of seedless raisins. 
2} pounds of clean dry currants. 
1} pounds of citron, shred fine. 
2 ounces of mixed ground spices— cinnamon*

18 ounoes of flour. 

Mix up same as pound oake, after the flour is all 
in add the 2 ounces of spice, then the ooflbe, molas- 
ses, brandy and lemon extract. The batter will then 
be quite thin. Dust the flruit well with flour and 
and mix it in. 

Line two cake molds with buttered paper and di- 
vide the mixture into tbem. Set the molds in the 
middle of a sheet or two of greased paper, gather it 
up around them and tie with twine, thus wrapping 
the molds in paper to shield them from too much 
heat and avoid burning the flruit. Bake from 2 to 
2} hours in a slack oven. 

658. The black cake above should be at least 2 
or 8 days old before it is cut. The amount of cake 
batter only servee to hold \.he fruit together, but, it 
ought to be mentioned, the quantity of the pound 
oake mixture in it may be doubled and al! the other 
ingredients remain the same and it will still be a 
very rich black cake.

681. How to Make Stock Teaat. 

There are two parts to this process, requiring 
about 5 days time before new ferment can be made 
from the new stock. But as stock will keep at 
least a month and much longer if bottled and kept 
in the ice-house, the trouble does not recur very 
often. The first part is: ~^ 



682. 



Bottle Teaat. The Beffinninff of 
Yeast. 



Get a strong quart bottle, an ale or champagne 
bottle will do. Make some strong hop tea by boil- 
ing a large haadfiil of hops in a quart of water, 
cool it and strain it into the bottle, squeexiog the 
hops dry to get the ftiU strength. The bottle must 
only be t wo t h irds full. Then put into the bott le, be- 
sides, two handfuls of ground malt and one handftil 
of sugar. Shake up, cork, and tie the cork down 
with twine, like ginger-pop. Set the bottle on a 
warm sbelf in a comer of the kitchen where it will 
not be disturbed and will not be in danger of getting 
too warm in the heat of the day. Let it stand there 
from 44 to 48 hours, by which time it will be yeast 
on a small scale, ready to start fermentation in the 
stock itself. 

683. Second Part. Stock Teast. 

The bottle having stood long enough-— or two 
days after oorkiog it down — make about 2 gallons 
of hop tea by putting a pail of water into a kettle 
with a lot of hops — nearly a pound — and boiling 
them about an hour with a lid on the kettle. Put 2 
pounds of flour into a large jar, pan, or keg and 
strain some of the boiling hop water into it — enough 
to wet and scald the flour thoroughly when stirred 
up ; when there are no more lumps in the flour 
strain in all the rest of the hop water and oool it 
with a piece of ice. After that put in a quart of 
coarse ground malt and J pound of supar. When 
this mixture is no more than milk wamv take the 
bottle yeast, hold the neck downwards and o<^reftilly 
draw the cork— which will come out like the eork 



THB AMEBICAK PASTRY COOK.

from a bottle of champagne — and mix the two 
together. Set the jar or keg containing the 
stock in a warm comer where it may ferment 
undisturbed, and in a day and a hall or two days 
afterwards the stock will be read/ to start 
ferment with, as has already been directed at 
number 512* 

It is not necessary to make the bottle yeast 
every time that stock is made, for new stock may 
be started with some of the old stock remaining, 
but whenever the ferment seems weak and slow, 
and whenever the bread begins to turn sour be- 
fore it is light, then new stock should be started 
from the very foundation, in the bottle. 

It may be observed that the above method 
renders a person who can get the raw materials 
quite independent of e^ery other person's yeast 
and of an^ other kind of yeast to start with He 
makes his own from the very first gemu 



684. Oenuine VIeiina Bella 

4 pounds of flour. 

1 quart of milk. 

1 onnoe of (Isrman eomp weso d yeast. 

1 ounee of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of sugur. 

Make the milk lukewarm and disMlve the yeast 
in it. Set sponge at 9 in the morning, at noon add 
the salt and sugar and make ap stiff dough. Let 
rise till about 4. Then work the dough well on the 
table by pressing oat and folding over. 

Roll out the dough in one large sheet as thin as 
you can, whioh will be about the thinness of a din- 
ner plate edge ; then measuring with your hand out 
the dough into strips or bands as wide across as your 
hand is long. Gut these again into triangular pieces 
for rolls, not equal sided but long and narrow tri- 
angles. Roll these triangular pieces up, beginning 
at the broad bottom end, and the point wiU come up 
in the middle, and there will be a spiral mark 
aiouod flrom end to end. 

Oive each roll a few turns under the hands to 
smooth it and place it on the baking pan in the form 
of a crescent— just the shape and site of the new 
moon. Brush over with water. Let rise in the 
pans about half an hour and bake about ten minntos 




Genuinb Vienna Rolls 



Some time ago the writer saw a Vienna Model 
Bakery— so called — ^begin and flourish awhile, and 
at last go into bankruptcy in an attempt to introduce 
atid make the above described rolls popular in a 
community that had but little appreciation of their 
excellence. For one thing it erst the firm $2.50 per 
week for compressed yeast alone, to arrive on cer- 
taia days by express, when they might have made 
the common kind at a scarcely appreciable cost. 

The lesson is: German bread for the Germans* 
but Vienna rolls cannot be forced into the position 
of favoritism that is held by Parker House or Albany 
rolls, or split rolls by any other name Make the 
Vienna ehape, however, out of French roll dough. 
Brush over the sheet of dough with a little melted 
butter, then roll up the rolls, and af er baking they 
they can be unroUed, and |he people who eat will 
admire them. 

685« Baker's Apple Oake. 



A sheet of the coflhe cake dough (No. 640) covered 
with apples in slices stuck in edgewise and, after a 
liUle time allowed for it to rise, baked in a slack 
oven. Plain bread or toU dough is sometimes made 
to serve the purpose at the bakeries, and the apples 
are basted while baking with syrup and dredged 
with oinnamoD. 

A Plea for the Pastry Cook. 

<'In the time of Charles IX. of France, pastry 
cooks made such advance that the products of their 
industry held an honorable place in every feast; and 
they formed a considerable corporaticn, for we find 
that prince invest ing it wit h certain privileges ' ' So 
says our most respected advocate and authority, and 
oontinues: ** It is easy to entertain a large number 
of healthy appetites; with plenty of meat, venison, 
game, and some large pieces of fish, a feast for sixty 
is soon ready. But to please months that only open 
in affectation, to tempt women fhH of fkncies, to 
excite stomachs of papier maehe^ or rouse an appe- 
tite which is ever flickeriog in the socket, would 
require more genius, insight, and labor than the res- 
olution of one of the problems of the Geometry of 
the Infinite." 

The pastry cook's ocoupation ought at least to 
rank equal to the meat cook's in the organixation of 
the working force of a hotel. If it at present is 
held subordinate the reason may be found in the 
binding force of inherited customs; f)r the meat 
cook's office has existed ever since men first began 
to slay animals and toast their flesh over the camp 
fire for food, while the pnstry cook's is a later out- 
growth of the highest civilization But having the 
more delicate and difficult tasks to perform it de- 
minds for their perfect execution a rarer kind of 
alent. Almost any person of ordinary shrewdnen

and apitude OAsiwlIy thrown for awhile amongst the 
oookB in a hotel may set up with a fair cbanoe of 
niooeeding as a meat oook himself in (he Tastly pre- 
pondsrAtiog number of places where cheapness has 
to be the first coaaideration, and trom that may eas- 
Qy reach the more lucratiye positions ; but first-lass 
pastry-cooks, cannot be made in that way, for pas- 
try cooking, including bread making and baking, is 
a more exact trade, a matter depending upon weights 
and measures and a particular manipulations, not to 
be trusted to guess work without long prsTious 
practice. The products of the meat cook's labor are 
set before people prepared for their enjoyment with 
appetites sharpened by hunger. The cook, and the 
steward of practiced taste may discern in the soup 
a slight burnt or smoky or unpleasant flayor, yet 
the entire company will probably partake of it with 
eigoyment without perceiying anything amiss; but 
after the keen appetites have been appeased let 
something of the pastry cook's be sent to table burd- 
ened with a similar inferiority and it will be imme- 
diately and almost unanimously mgected. It used to 
be the frequent remark of a yery successftil hotel- 
keeper, that ''people iak$ mare notiee of the pastry 
than of any other part of the dinner." The chara^ 
ter of the table is more apt to be judged by the 
quality of the products of the pastry cook's labor, 
including the warm breads, waffles, and cakes, than 
by anything else, and if the working man or woman 
of the culinary department is possessed of taste and 
perception in a superior degree their quality can no- 
where be so well displayed as in the last course of 
a dinner upon the dainty dishes that are set about to 
bear oomparsion and to hold their place if they may 
among the rich fruits and nuts, the wines, the flowers 
of the dessert 

But if the pastry cook's art may claim considenu 
tion because of its capacity for contributing to what 
is delicate, elegant, and ornate, it has eyen greater 
claims on the score of usefulness. Up and down the 
crowded streets of one of the largest and busiest cities 
— Chicago to- wit— at frequent interyals maybe found 
restaurants with all sorts of meats, fish and fowls 
displayed with their gamishings in the most tempt- 
ing manner possible; and between them and twice 
as frequent are the beer halls with their lunch dis- 
played, more or lens free, of boiled meat, tripe, 
chopped cabbage and rye bread, the indications 
seeemiog to be that all the men are eaters only of 
meat and its "trimmings." But not so. There are 
other places where men lunch and dine. There are 



bakeries in Chicago which are in reality large facto* 
ries, as extensiye as seme pork packing establish- 
ments, and these making specialties of pies, bread, 
cakes, or crackers seem— if we may be allowed to 
make a rough guess — to supply about one.^aurth of 
the entire city. These large bakeries have shops for 
vstA^Ung, large double stores in the heart of the city, 
conyerted into lunch houses with long counters and 
rows of stools, and waiters, clerks and cashierfe, 
and they are crowded during about two hours 
of each meal time about six hours of the day, 
with men taking a meal of bread cakes, pies and oof- 
fee, tea, or milk. Nothing is cooked there except the 
colFee made by steam heat. They serre French split 
rolls and round graham rolls with butter, three for 
fiye cents, in little baskets ; cofiee-cakes made up in 
twists like one of our cuts, and brushed oyer with 
syrup, two for fiye cents ; yellow rusks in long shape 
like rolls; Boston brown bread, yery brown and 
baked in pails, or deep molds same shape. Apple 
cake they haye, and '•stoUen," and ''Lincoln pie," 
here called *' Washington pie;" small sponge cakes 
baked in pans the length of a finger, also lady- 
fingers, one cent apiece; milk bread baked in long 
tin molds, plum cake, baked "apple dumplings," 
and pies; homemade pies, with pumpkin and 
custard thick, eyen up to the brim, lemon pie with 
meringue on top, mince and apple. 

Our interest in this matter is that of a theorist 
liking to find his bellefli yerified. Meat is the most 
expensiye and wasteful article of hotel proyision« 
We haye found in hotels that in proportion as the 
breads and other articles included under the head of 
pastries rose in excellence the demand upon the 
meats was lessened, to the benefit, probably, of all 
concerned. The products of these large city baker- 
ies are good with the uniform excellence that might 
be expected of factory work and because they are good 
the sales are immense. The lunch or meal of this 
kind costs but from ten to thirty cents, yet its 
cheapness is not its only recommendation, for the 
crowds cf customers are not of the tramping class ; 
they are the foremen and workmen of the huge ware- 
houses near by, the compositors, machinists, clerks, 
salesmen, tradesmen and professional men who prac- 
tice the dietetic moralities. Good bread, good butter, 
and good coflfee— has it not almost passed into a pro- 
verb that these are the first requisites to an excelleat 
tabltf and taking the country over, away from the 
yery large bakeries and the very best hotels are there 
any articles seldomer to be found?

Fairy Butt«r. 



The yolkt of 4 hard boiled eggs. 

1 teacupful of the best butter. 

3 heaping taUespoonftils powdered sugar. 

1 teaspoonfnl orange flower water. 

Either grate the yolks or pound and rub them 
smooth in a bowl, mix the softened butter with them 
and the sugar and flavoring. Set the mixture where 
it will get cold, and afterward rub it through a 
sieye. It looks something like Termicelli. 

Pile the fairy butter lightly in the middle of a cake 
dish, cut the snow cake in slices and lay around. 
They are to be eaten together like bread and butter. 



Appl« 8oiifEL«. 



On account of the scarcity of culinary terms, the 
word soufflle has to stand for a great number of 
light articles that may have very little resemblance 
to each other. This consists of a border of dry 
stewed apple raised in a large dish or an ice cream 
saucer, as the case may be, the hollow middle filled 
with boiled custard and whipped white of egg and 
sugar, like the frosting on lemon pies, piled on top. 
It need not be baked, but the top may be browned 
by holding a red hot shovel over it on the shelf in 
the oven. Served cold. 

€87. Bggr X<emoiiad« for Fifty. 

8 quarts of water — a tin milk pail full. 

3 pounds of sugar— 6 or 7 cupfuls. 

2 dozen lemons. 

2 oranges. 

8 or 10 whites of eggs. 

Shaved or broken ice. 

Grate the rinds of 8 or 10 of the lemons and the 
oranges into a large bowl, using a tin grater, and take 
less or more, according to the size and degree of 
ripeness or greenness of the fruit. Scrape off the 
grated rind that adheres. Put a little sugar in the 
bowl, and mb the zest and sugar together with the 
back of a spoon. Squeeze in the juice of all, add 
*lhe sugar and some water and then the whites of 
eggs, and beat the mixture till the sugar is dissolved ; 
put in water to make the specified amount and 
strain the lemonade into another vessel containing 
ice. 

When to be served fill a glass three parts full, in- 
vert another on top, the rims close together, and 
shake up to make the foam.

PUun X««monado* 



Three or four lemons, according to size, and a 
small cup of sugar to a quart of water. Slice th^ 
lemons into the water beforehand, and let stand. 
Put shaved ice in the glasses before filling. 



Clear lemonade can be obtained by filtering it« 
when made, through blotting paper folded to fit in 
a glass funnel.

Oatawaba Gap. 



To each bottle of dry catawba allow two bottles 
of soda water and a quarter pint of curacoa, mix in 
a pitcher, and add ice abundantly. If not conveni- 
ent to get bottled soda, use water and sugar or 
lemonade to mix with the wine and liqueur. 

690. Tea I6r a Largo Party. 

To make what tea-drinkers call a real good cup of 
tea take nearly a teaspoonful of green tea for each 
cup, or 4 teaspoonfuls to 5 cups of water, the leaves 
absorbing 1 cup. But then there is a second draw- 
ing that brings this out. 

Four ounces of tea contain 28 teaspoonfuls or 2 
cupfuls, rounded up. Using mixed tea, and allow- 
ing time to draw to draw 2 cupfuls of tea is sufiicient 
to put into 40 cups of water, or a quarter>pound of 
tea to 2i gallons of water, which is the same thing 
in other words. 

The best way to make tea for a number is to have 
the water boiling in an urn and put the tea in a box 
made of perforated tin and drop it into the water, 
which must then be stopped from boiling. 



661. 



Wliite Coffee. 



Is made with coffee that, instead of being browned, 
is only baked to a slight yellow color and is not 
ground, or at most the berries are only bruised, and 
is made with one-half milk and one-half water. It 
requires twice as much coffee as the ordinary. 

For 8 cups t ke : 

2 cupfuls of light baked coffee berries. 

4 cupfuls of boiling water. 

6 cupfuls of boiliug milk. 

The berries may have been parched before, but 
when wanted heat them over again and throw them 
hot into the boiling water. Close the lid and let 
stand to draw for half an hour, then add the boiling 
milk through a strainer. 

When the milk is first set on to boil, put in a 
tablespoonfal or two of sugar to prevent burning at 
the bottom. Serve sugar with the coffee as usual, 
and, if for a party, a spoonful of whipped cream in 
each cup. 



661a. 



Ohocolate. 



1 quart of milk and water. 

i ounce of chocolate. 

Boil the milk and water in a small, bright sauce- 
pan. Scrape down an ounce as marked on the half 
pound cakes of common chocolate, throw it in and 
beat with a wire egg whisk about one minute, or till 
the chocolate is all dissolved.

MM. Mayonaiae Salad Dresaintf. 

**l%r€e Hma the spoon with oil of Lucca crowBi 

And anee with vmsyar procured from town«" 

3 or 4 raw yolks of eggs. 

1 teacupftil of olive oil. 

About half as much vinegar. 

A teaspoonful of salt. 

Drop the yolks into a bowl, soup plate, or deep, 
bright saucepan, add about as much oil and stir 
them together with a wooden spoon— Hir any other 
kind of a spoon — ^for a minute or two, then com- 
mence beating and add oil a tablespoonftil at a Ume. 
After five minutes stirring and beating, the oil being 
more than half in, throw in the salt and begin ad- 
ding the vinigar also by spoonfuls. On the addition 
of the salt the mayonalse will be very likely to 
thicken up at once and the vinegar is required to 
reduce it, as well as for flavor. 

The above is the way of making plain, straight- 
forward mayonaise that is practiced by cooks and 
their assistants daily all over the country, and being 
such a very simple operation there is no wonder if 
they do not see the reason for making so much ado 
about it. It takes ton or fifteen minutes to bring it 
to the proper consistence. There might be difficulty 
iftheingredients were warm; as a matter of habit 
oooks always keep the oil in a cold place. In hot 
weather set the bowl in ice water. Mayonaise of 
the required thickness cannot probably be made 
with a smaller proportion of oil, but the same yolks 
will take up much more if need be* 



A quicker way than the foregoing is: Pkoe the 
yolks in a deep quart bowl — set in ice water, if 
warm weatheis-edd a spoonfdl of oil and whip with 
a Dover egg beater. In half a minute add more oil, 
then the salt, and. the mixture will at onoe become 
like butter. Keep thinning with oil and vinegar as 
in the other casci three proportions of oil to one of 
rinegar. 



Uses of the Mayonaise. 



rhe mayonaise when right is like softened butter, 
only more tenacious— too thick to run. It is to be 
spread smoothly over the top of the pile or shape of 
salad material, over the fillet of fish or form of lob- 
ster or shrimp, or over the whole fish — giring a 
glossy yellow surface to be ornamented as desired. 
It is to be eaten with the salad material as butter 
would be. Sometimes for ornamental purposes it is 
stirred into the too loose material to make taller 
shapes. 

It is to be mixed with about an equal amonnt of

a«pio jelly — (the jelly being cold enough to be just 
on the point of aettieg) to form oold tartar sauce^ 
a yellow, flaTored ecid jelly. Also mixed with 
different pteparations it makes sauoet or dressiogs 
of other colors — emerald green and cardinal 
red. Besides these employments it is used in the 
form of 

€I95« SALAD OBKAX, 01 THIH MATOHAISI. 

Rednce the thick mayonaise to the consistency of 
cream by adding more vinegar or Tioegar and water 
— in some oases milk or cream— and if you wish to 
be particular use some clear strained chicken broth 
(cold) or unseasoned soup stock with the Tinegar, 
instead of water. For lobster and other shell fish, 
howcTer, all Tinegar may be used, as they take away 
its sharpness. This salad cream used as a sauce 
makes almost any kind of Tegetable, meat and fish 
palatable and relishiog if served with it cold and 
crisp. 



Palatable, that is, to those who do not dislike 
olive oil. And some of your people will make the 
thin mayonaise for themselves. Some will choose 
their dinner in courses even from su American form 
bill of fare, and salads are as *<£uniliar in their 
mouths as household words." Seeing you have 
mayonaise they are apt to order it plain and wiih 
the condiment s and relishes before them make their 
own variations on their own plates. 

My Italian friend who almost invariably for his 
own meals makes a falad, or at least something akin 
to salad, with oil poured over, looks askance at the 
vinegar and remarks : *< Along the shores of the 
M( diterranean the people, the wealthy people, the 
mercantile people, do not use vinegar more than to 
the amount of a squeese of a lemon — it is the com- 
mon people, the people of the interior, tlie pea'ants 
(and he shrugs his shoulders contemptuouslj) » onl? 
the peasants who pour vioegar plentifully over their 
green stuff and call it salad" A remark which 
nuty serve to give the right hang of that Spanish 
proverb about ealad-making: "A spendthrift for 
oil, a niggard f ^r vinegar, and a madman to mix the 
salad toge her " For there are those who think the 
one who pours*in any oil at all is the madman, and 
at any rate think it will be better to let the spend- 
thrift donate the vinegar instead of the oil. There 
are a^so motives of economy in fhvor of the wroog 
reading; but we cooks are perfectly disinterested 
and had just as lief make our dressing without oil 
as not. 



The following, if a rather large quantity for fifty 
persons for dinner, is not too much for a supper 
salad on a hot summer evening, when the thought 
alone of all other food is wearisome disgust. 



eOO. HoUandaise Salad Oream. 

i pint of good white wine vinegar. 

i pint scant of water. 

8 ounces of butter. 
12 yolks of eggs. 

1 tablespoonful made mustard. 

A pinch of cayenne. Salt. 

Boil the vinegar, water, and salt and batter aU 
together in a bright saucepan. Beat the yolks a 
little, add some of the boiling liquid and stir them 
together, then mix all and let come to Ute boiling 
point. It is on the same principal as making cus- 
tard. If allowed to thorougihlf boil it wUl curdle, 
and have to be thrown away; if taken off too soon it 
will not be rich and thick enough One minute of 
stirring after the yolks are added is usually enough. 
Strain and set on ioe to be cold for use. 



The preceding will be found eminently satlslkctory 
and can bo used in almoet every place that 
mayonaise would be employed. It can be made 
thicker or thinner as required, but when thinned 
must be rapidly beaten and the liquid — water or 
broth and vinegar — added by degrees, otherwise the 
dressing may separate and the butter oome to the 
top. This, however, seldom occurs. 

It is generally an object to have mayofiaiM creamy 
white, for which purpose lemon juice is added to it, 
but the hoUandaue dressing is golden yellow, an^ 
the better for vegetable salads like the following, 
which have no good looks of their own.

And my Italian friend looked on dubiously when

lima beans, and afterwards over com, and green 
peas, and string beans, as if he thought in Italian,

these are at least simple and firom their looks in- 
viting. And you cut also beets in dice and mix in, 
and they stain the cut potatoes, and the red juice 
mingles with the pale yellow of the mayonaise and 
makes an uneatable color." He put on his study-

ing o*p and presently adopted the butter beans 
salad, as well as the others, but he did not give up 
the cut beets ia saliid oream. Mere matters of fancy 
perhaps — but jet we presently disooYer which 
things are popular. 



Lima beans, so generally esteemed, in their green 
state haye but a very short season. Contrary to the 
general rule, the dried are better than the canned 
beans for winter use. 

e©8, 

The secret of cooking all dried beans soft is in the 
following : 

Wash and pick them over careAilly and put them 
on in plenty of cold water with a rounding teaspoon- 
fbl of soda for every two pounds of beans. 

Boil about 2 or 8 hours till they be^n to be sof^. 
Then pour them suddenly ^into a colander to drain, 
turn them back in the boiler and put in enough 
fresh cold water to coyer them. 

Set them to boil again — in half an hour more they 
will be thoroughly cooked. The sudden adding of 
eold water to the hot beans causes the skin to crack, 
after which they finish cooking easily. There is no 
eicuse for the stupidity of the mule-driying cooks 
told of in Seribner^M MonUdy (Rocky Mountain 
Cookery,) who carry the beans partly cooked in 
their kettles and recook them for three suooessiTC 
days in the Tain attempt to make them soft. Our 
lima beans are oomparatiyely easy, but the most 
refractory sample of nayy beans can be reduced in 
fiye hours by the aboye method eyen at an eleyation 
of 11,000 feet 



Oaulifiower Salad. 



4 to 6 pounds of cauliflower. 

The hoUandaise salad cream of the preceding re- 
ceipt 

A little oil and yinegar. 

Cut the branches of the cauliflower in the right 
•ised pieces for indiyidual dishes while raw, trim 
the stems off eyenly, let stand in a pan of cold 
water an hour or two. Set it on with plenty of cold 
water to coyer it, to boil, and add salt, but nothing 
else. Cook till the thick stems will leaye the fork 
as in boiling potatoeft-^-an hour or less. Drain 
without breaking the pieces and set away to get cold 

Mix a little oil and vinegar with the cauliflower as 
well as may be by careful pouring from one bowl to 
another. Over each piece placed on individual 
dishes pour a spoonfal of the salad cream, which 
should be thick enough to mask it and not run off in 
the ditth. 



Cauitfliwer salad is worth decorating. A few 
capers, French green peas shaken about in vinegar, 
■ome small patterns stamped out of beet slices, or a 
•prig of parsley. 



For luncheon or a party dinner build up the cau- 
liflower in pyramidal form, or like half a melon, with 
fork and knife, laying the pieces in order around 
the dish, the largest at the bottom, heads outward, 
and another tier on top of that, the salad cream to 
be poured over all, and decorate according to your 
taste.

The grains of com are required to be distinct and 
clean and free f^m mush, and should be washed In 
a colander for the purpose. 

Before going on to describe the other available 
everyday salad dressings let us include one more 
variety best dressed with the bright hoUandaise. 



TOl. Vegetable Salad— Plain. 

Take equal parts of four, five or six kinds of 
cooked vegetables — green peas, string beans, cauli- 
flowers, asparagus heads not too soft cooked, corn, 
Lima beans and potatoes, and a smaller proportion 
of onions — ^if small green ones so much the better — 
and a few slices of beets for ornament. Cut the po- 
tatoes in small dice, the string beans and onions to 
match, and pull the cauliflower apart in small sprigs- 
Mix all with a little reasoning of pepper and salt 
and shake them about in the salad eream in a bowl. 
Dish up with cut beets and chopped parsley sprink- 
eled over the top. 

Cooks who care to follow the analogist will have 
observed that hoUandaise salad cream is very like 
the hot hoUandaise sauce used so much in the high- 
est style cookery, not only for ' a fish sauce but 
equally for asparagus, cauliflower, artichoke, pota- 
toes, etc. The difference is only in the proportions 
and in this being used cold. HoUandaise or Dutch 
sauce by the English method is mitder, the French 
more concentrated and pungent Jhis dressing an* 
swers the question of what we shall do when we 
have no oil, and the people I have instruted with 
penciUings by the way, have generaU? taken more 
pleasure in making ii than the other more trouble* 
some varieties. 

Still when we have this and the genuine Frendi 
mayonaise there remains a want of which we are re- 
minded when people looking over a table unsatis- 
factorily furnished with lettuce without boUed eggs 
on top, and over a bill of fare equally incomplete 
send timidly asking the powers that be if they can't 
have a hard-boUed egg*or two for their salad. Such 
persons have been known to send written on a biU 
of fare the lines imputed to Sidney Smith :

Best Potato Salad. 



FaTorite hotel supper dish. 
2 quarts of boiled potatoes. 

1 8m>ill onion. 

2 lablespoonftils of chopped parsley. 

The popular talad dresoing of the preceding re- 
ceipt. 

Slice or break the potatoes, minoe the onion ex- 
tremely small, mix, pour the dreesiog over and 
combine thoroughly by turning the salad from one 
tewl to another three or four times. Throw the 
firesh chopped parsley into it just before serring. 
The wttites of the eggs may be added, cut in strips. 



The foregoing is the formula, the rut to run in, 
but how shall we iniuse life into it or explain the 
particular knack which makes one person's, potato 
salad so utterly unlike and superior to another's ? 
Gold potatoes which have remained in the dinner 
steamers three hours, then are peeled and sliced, 
may do — ^the dressing will carry the burden of their 
inferiority, but they are not best. 

Take new potatoes if you can, if not, good 
mealy old ones, pare aodj divide in large pieces. 
Throw them in cold salted water and boil about half 
an hour, or till j net done. Drain the water from 
them and break the largest pieces apart with a 
twist of a fork. When nearly cold mix the dressing 
with the potatoes and set the bowl on iee till wanted* 



We obtain the best salads with the least ftiss 
when we can get those tnfling cooks, two or more 
of them, to ran a rivalry with each other who can 
maJLe the best. The last described dressing is a 
little tedious, being a double compound of cooked 
and raw. The person dishing up vegetables during 
the slow latter end of dinner generally can prepare 
it between times to be ready for the next meal. 

All these salad dressings are susceptible of im- 
prevement by added flavorings, and the epicure 
gets in his extra harmonies in that way. Not to 
confuse cur directions WQ will treatr of the flavoring 
eomplications by themselves in a special chapter.

Bubbixiff the Dish with (Sarlic. 

There are yams and yams about great secrets in 
c.)okery andj their Ipossessors,! like one in the 
BxpoBTBB recently of a castaway Frenchman who 
made the fortune of a Russian innkeeper and of the 
town by imparting the secret of French chicken 
fricassee. What a curious scrap-book might be 
made if some of the people who have tfane.to play 
would collect these wonderftd gastronomioal and 
culinary anecdotes I 

The really good cooks of the country practice 
thousands of the fine touches which the uninitiated 
might term great secrets, and throw them all into 
the grand aggregate that is styled exceUence of the 
hotel cuisine. Some of these fine touches lie in 
flavoring salads, more particularly the salad dress* 
ings, and one of them is to rub the salad dish with 
garlic. There mm a head waiter in Boston once

who rubbed the dish with g«rUo and his talsde were 
in great repute, though none could leli the R'cret of 
the subtle aroma they possessed. If any looked for 
Tulgar garlic in the salad they found none. It was 
only a case of the scent of the roses that hung round 
it still. PoTt of hook baiting trick, an illusion, as it 
were. Possibly some otstaway Frenchman had im- 
parted this secret to this head waiter of the Boston 
hotel, but it was impos7ible for it to remain un- 
shared, and so a waiter, after a while, discoyered 
his superior rubbing the dish with garlic Now two 
persons possessed the secret and of ooiine they 
could not both lire in one house. There u«ed to be 
an awful story told about the great Oaptain Cook 
and his too smart cabin boy who, when at the anti- 
podes, was asked by the gleeful captidn if he knew 
where he was, and had the indiscretion to answer 
*'under London bridge." But the captidn would 
not allow anyone to remain in the Tcssel who knew 
as much as he did himself, and pitched the poor boy 
oTcrbeard, which was Tery shocking, and that is 
about what happened to this poor^ waiter, so he went 
Wert. 



Franca 



ancatelli instructing the English cooks in French 
cookery could not quite abandon garlic, but found 
it necessary to warn them not to use a head of gar- 
lic, but only one cIotc, and took occasion to remark, 
•'OTcr-seasoning is the bane of English cookery." 

A liitle touch of garlic is desirable, it is the petit 
point tTail in a ragout praised by Sir Walter Scott. 
And this is but one of many flaTorings to be used 
with discretion, for which no directions can be giv- 
en. The foregoing will perhaps give point to the 
following excerpt from Brillat-SaTarin, so far as to 
call attention to the flavorings named : 

** I prefer; to tell the story of a Frenchman of 
Limousin, who made his fortune in London by his 
skill in mixing a salad. Although his means were 
very limited, Albignac (so he was cilled, if I re- 
member right) went one day to dine in one of the 
most famous taverns in London. Whilst he was 
finishing his succulent beefsteak, there were five or 
six young dandies of good family regaling them- 
selves at a neighboring table. One of them came to 
him and sa'd very politely: <Sir, it is said that 
your nation excels in the art of making salads; will 
you be so good as oblige us by mixing one?' 

*<D'Albigoao consenting, after a litt?e hesitation, 
ordered all thai he thought necessary for the expect- 
ed masterpiece, used his best endeavors, and had 
the good luok to succeed. 

"Whilst studying the ingredients, he answered 
flrankly all questions about himself. He said he 
was an emigrant and admitted, not without some 
natural shame, that he was receiving assistance 
from the English government — a circumstance 
which no doubt authorized one of the young men to 
slip into the exile's hand a five-pound note, and in- 



sist on his keeping it. 

*<He had given his address, and some time after, 
he received a very civil note, requesting him to go 
and mix a salad in one of the finest houses in Gros- 
venor Square. D' Albignac arrived punctually, 
after fiimishing himself with tome special season- 
inge and maturing his plans. He bad the good luck 
to succeed again. 

"The first party for whom he had manipulated 
had exaggersted the merits of his salad, and the 
second company made so much more noise about it, 
that d' Albignac' s repntation^was already made. He 
was known as the fkshionable talad maker, and soon 
had a gig, in order to keep his appointments, with a 
servant to bring his mahogany case containing all 
the ingredients — such as vinegars of diflferentfla* 
vers, oils with or without a fhiity taste, soy, 
caviare, truffles, anchovies, ketchups, gravies, and 
even hard-boiled eggs. 

"Li^r he got oases made to order, furnished 
them completely and sold them by hundreds. In 
short he came to realise a fortune of more than 
eighty thousand firanos." 

T14. ^"""^ 

In those countries where butter is held in little 

esteem and olive oil in a large degree takes its 
place, it may naturally be surmised the fhstidious 
people are as particular in the quality of oil and its 
combinations and critical of their flavors as Ameri- 
cans and English of **Cf0ld Spring Creamery Oilt 
Edged" and the famous "Suffolk Dairy Butter." 
The impossibility of improving the flavor of butter 
by any addition does not exist in regard to oil, and 
it seems quite possible for connoiseurs to surprise 
the palate of their friends by new admixtures, 
especially in mayonaise and salads. In Bnssia, it it 
said, the oil of sunflower seed is largely used for 
salad making. The olive oil which now comes fh>m 
California has much the same nutty flavor, or pei^ 
haps more resembles the taste of beech nuts. The 
best we can ask for is to have oil as nearly tasteless 
as possible if we want to make salads more popular, 
and above all ngect the oil which is sold cheap 
because it has become rancid, just as we reject strong 
butter. 

If we cannot afford to select our oils of various 
brands — "with or without a fhiity taste" — accord- 
ing to the use intended, we need not be so restrict- 
ed in the choice of vinegars of various flavors, to 
give variety to the mayonaise. 

French cooks who disagree in most things are all 
agreed in using tarragon vinegar for salad dressings 
whenever it can^be had and look with a withering 
sort of pity on the American cook who has never had 
even a pint of it bought for his use in the whole 
course of his life. They don't know how tbankfbl 
be is if even the plain vinegar furnished proves not 
to be diluted sulphuric acid.

T15. Tarragon Vineffar. 



Qreen tarragon is a herb and oan be bought of the 
market gardeners in large cities. It is said to be 
best and strongest just as the plant is going into 
Uossom. 

1 pound of tarragon leaTce. 

4 quarts of white wine Tinegar. 

Let steep in a stone jar two weeks. 

Then filter it through a flannel jelly bag, add to it 
a quarter ounce of isinglass (gelatine will do) dis- 
solyed in warm cider or Tinegar, to clarify it, bottle 
it and let it stand a month, when it is to be decanted 
into small bottles to keep. 

Bat hotel cooks can neyer do all that, which is a 
foreign method for phlegmatic people. Reader, did 
yon CTcr go into the bar-room of a back country 
hotel— say in Missouri— though P§eJI^» Am says 
lowa^-and see on the back shelf a series of home 
made extracts, jars of whiskey with something in ii? 
One of these is tansy — green tansy leayes put in to 
flayer the liquor. That is for tansy bitters. An- 
other has peaches. That is for peach and sugar.* 
Others haye cherries, lemon peel, orange peel. They 
are for we know not what. But tarragon oan be 
steeped in cold yinegar like tansy in whisky, and 
half a pint of flayored yinegar thus be had at any 
time. Use it sparingly in piace of part of the plain 
yinegar in any of the salad dressings, not flayoring 
strongly, howeyer, as tarragon is a stranger to most 
of our people. 



Tarraffon Vinegar. 



1 pound of green tarragon, partly dried before 
using. 

6 small onions. 

1 ounce of long pepper. 

8 quarts of white wine or cider yinegar. 

Put the whole in a stone jug, cork and let steep 
seyeral weeks. Strain through a napkin or silk seiye 
before using.

2 pounds of the solid oelery roots and stalks th^t 
yoa cannot use on the table — all white, however, 



and sweet.

it to the oelery in a stone jar. Add a tablespoonftd 
of salt, stir up, let steep till next day then strain 
into a demyohn or stone jug and cork it tight. 
This may be used in almost all salads in place of part 
of the plain yinegar. 



Eight ounces of celery seed scalded with a quart 
of boiling yinegar and let stand to steep makes the 
same kind of flayored yinegar as the foregoing. 

But celery extract ready prepared is cheap enough 
and more conyenient than either.

7QS. Perpetual Hotel Salad. 



Although some of the things just examined into 
may be out of the regular routine, and occasion an 
impatient shrug, let us not pads them without some 
consideration, or rather let us go to the extreme 
contrast of the perpetual salad that we are used ta 
Perpetual salad has no dressing and wants no flavor- 
ing nor aromatic vinegars—only vinegar, pepper 
and salt. And — oh, yes, onions — lots of onions — 
we had nearly forgot. It is said Americans are 
scarcely more saltd-loving than the English, and 
some have never tasted salad, yet who does not 
know this one—the perpetual salad made by the 
frugal cook 7 It is always made after dinner. Into 
a deep tin pan — in nice places it may be a bowl — 
goes all the boiled potatoes that have been left over, 
and then an onion slictd* Then there will be some 
beets, beans, peas, butter beans, perhaps corn, then 
some onions, pepper, salt, vinegar, and it may be 
some fried bacon and the &t poured over, and this 
salad has been known to have diluted cook6d toma- 
toes mixed in. Some frugal cooks will make dis- 
tinctions — will have pnjudioes. One draws the line 
at com, and appeals to authority: **Who ever heard 
of corn beiog put in salad ?" Another will set his 
Ikoe against peas, and so on, but at aoy rate there 
will be potatoes and onions left, and beets, pepper, 
■alt and vinegar. No oil. It would be easy to make 
ftin of this, but wherefore 7 It is all right, only too 
crude, too perpetual. It is always for supper, and 
is at least better than none. It is so good it ought 
to be made still better and more various. 

With the potatoes cut in dice all of a size, the 
string beans cut in lengths diamond-shaped of size 
to match, the green peas washed from their sauce in 
warm water, the corn likewise, the onions greatly 
reduced in quantity and also out to match; with a 
little green stuff such as cress or parsley, or a very 
little green onion tops, or celery, sprinkied in, and 



'with carrots, pickles and capers, as well as beets, 
cut to correspond and mixed in only at the last 
minute, this salad will be fine, and need not be al- 
ways alike. With any one of the easy salad dress- 
ings already directed to be made poured over and 
shaken about in it the salad will be stylish, 
attractive, enjoyable. Or, without a dressing of 
the made kind, with a little oil added and some 
chopped eggs this combination of materials that 
costs next to nothing will be equal to some of the 
best salads of the best cooks, with high-sounding 
names. 

We will go on and instance various foreign mix- 
tures of the same class, first taking a lessen ftpom 
one of the noted French cooks — Jules Goufie— -and 
as it is not an exact receipt to be proven but rather 
a general lesson in salad making we copy the follow^ 
ing as we find it. He says : 

T94* MAOXDOINX SALAD. 

*<The following incident first led me to prepare this 
salad : Whilst staying at a friend's country house, 
the miatress of the house came ^to me in great dis- 
tress, and confided to me that her supplies having 
failed, she was quite at a loss how to entertain her 
numerous guests, and asked me to assist her. 
When I investigated the atate of the laxder, I found 
there nothing but cold meat and poultry, and cold 
game; all these I took, and, after carefully paring 
and cutting them up, I made them into a huge salad 
which I mixed with an abuLdant and highly sea* 
soned Maffonnaue sauce, adding lettuce, olives, an. 
chevies, hard boiled eggs, pickles, and some 
chopped tarragon, chervil and sbalota. This salad, 
preceded by a good soup, and followed by sweets 
and fruit, was highly appreciated by the hungry 
guests." 

With all the materials mentioned it cannot be said 
the cupboard was very bare anyway, and the salad 
was neither cheap nor simple, nor hard to imitate; 
but does not the proceeding show the difference in 
national customs? An American would never have 
thought of making a salad, nor would the American 
hostess have fell conifortable seeing all the provisions 
going into that sort of compound. Some of us in- 
stead would likely have made a bill of fare of about 
120 dishes out of the material used to make the din- 
ner described. 

A macedoine salad, like a maoedoine of vegeta- 
bles, or of fruits, or macedoine Jelly, is a mixture of 
any number of different kinds and colou all cut to 
one size. Gouffe says his abundant mayonaise was 
highly seasoned. Elsewhere he says mayonaise 
should be highly fltvored. Some salads contain 
very high flavored ingredients and a small quantity 
suffices, as nome reject them altogether. Mayonaise 
may contain a large amount of mustard, used in • 
place of part of the raw eggs. Salads may have the

1 cupful of chopped white cabbage. 

Pepper, salt, oil, yinegar.

and mioce it as nearly in dice shape as may be. 
The salsify may be substituted with potatoes if 
necessary, out in dice or lozenge shapes. Mix all 
wih oil, vinegar, pepper and salt. 

T»T. 

While wre are yet exploring for strong and pungent 

ingredients with which perhaps some knowing one 
m«ght "unwonted richness to the salad give," it 
m^y be noticed that the repertory of the salad-mak- 
iDg D' Albignac of Limousin included both caviare 
and truffles. People who CDJoy anchoyy toast; 
which is toast spread with anchovy paste or anchovy 
batter, or eanapis aitx anckois; pieces of toast with 
filleted anchovies, will doubtless like eaiiapSB au 
caviare. These are all good palad accompaniments, 
and as anchovies ar^ commonly used in salads there 
is no good reason why caviare might not, but^it is 
more likely it was used only in the way of decora- 
tion. As to what caviare is — and it used to be 
termed Russian caviare as if it had been of Russian 
invention — the Scientific American gives this infor- 
mation : 

'*Hyde Park, some eighty*three miles up the 
Hudson River from New York, is one of the prin- 
cipal fishiog stations for sturgeon, whose roe, when 
properly prepared, is known as caviare, a food 
preparation greatly enjoyed by our German and 
French ci'izens. not to forget the Russians, to whom 



'we eiport large quantities every year. The roe 
weighs about one -third as much as the fish. A fifiy 
pound roe is considered a large roe. thirty pounds 
being the average. As soon as the sturgeons reach 
shore they are opened and the roes taken out. 
Masses of roe are rubbed through wire seives. The 
eggs are then salted for a short time, afier which 
they are laid on hair seives to drain ofL When' 
thoroughly drained wbat was but a short time ago 
only halibut spawn, is now the toothsome caviare of 
which thousands of pounds are annually spread on 
bread and eaten with much relish." 

Caviare, like every other eatable thing, can now 
be bought in cans. It is black nearly as truffles. 
Softened with a little warm butter it can be used 
with good effect to ornament dishes of fish salads in 
pipiog and leaf patterns. In the times when fash- 
ionable ladies used to decorate their fiEioes with huge 
patches of fancy patterns stamped out of court 
plaster, and white and yellow dishes on the table 
had the same done for them with tn ffle slices, it is 
very likely a similar service was required for fish 
en mayonaise, of the high-flavored caviare, 

T28. Salads and Bills of Fare. 

There will be a question, now that we are to de- 
scribe the more formal dinner salads, as to their 
proper place in the bill of fare, aod it would be ex- 
tremely convenient if the bills in use the world over 
would kindly keep themselves accordiog to a few 
definite patterns as, »ay, French, Russian, Erglish 
and American. In fact, however, amoog fifry model 
menus of European court dinners there are scarcely 
two alike in their Arrangement of dishes and head- 
ings, and the promiscuous billd of £are of American 
hotels do not vary more in their minor features than 
those of the pal. ces of the European nations. The 
slight differences betwixt salads and the cold 
hors-d'oeuvre often make it appear as if salads ap- 
peared in two places on the same bill. The follow- 
ing examples will, however, show the general usages 
in this respect. The first menu, chosen for its 
brevity, contains the intermediate fh>sen punch 
which has come to be regarded the distioguishing 
feature of the thorough French menu, although in 
the collection before us it appears so rarely as to 
seem more the exception than the rule.

THE AMBRICAN COOK.

the entremets, as if in ao American hotel bill we 
shonld place lobster salad among the Togetables.

It would be a relief to anyone after scanning three 
score and ten snch menus as the foregoing and find- 
ing the salads wandering up and down in the bills 
and going to and fro in the midst of them, to be able 
to give them a local habitation and a place all their 
own, as happily we do in our American hotel bill 
of fare, the form that is unborrowed, that contains 
some features of all the precediog specimens, yet is 
different Arom all, and more suitable to the habits 
and customs of the people. Some of the most re 
nowned hotels of the United States use the exact 
form following, and a very large number b^ide 
only make the one or two changes of placing ttie lit^t 
of boiled meats above ins' ead of beside the ro'if'ts, 
and substituting the line *<cold dishes and salads'* 
for m<)yonaiBe, dispensing with the cold meat? head.

The last named salad is found in the menu of a

Belgium, white chicory Is sold at a cheap rate early 
in the spring, and supplies a grateftil salad long be- 
fore lettuces are to be had " Endive and suoeory 
are other names for chicory. 



The definite object in view in bringing in the 
foregoing perhaps somewhat formidable looking 
mass of French is to discover what the best Euro- 
pean bill of &re composers and eooks do when they 
do their highest endeavors for the greatest occasions 
that can arise in their particular world, and not at 
all to lead any callow geese on this side to copy and 
use tJie imposing words they do not understand. 
We must have a standard to judge American hotel 
work by, and as far as names and words can go to 
give an idea, these imperial menus and the salad 
dishes culled firom many others mark the topmost 
notch. There are some American hotels, their 
menu writers, caterers and cooks, who would not 
consent to be ranked below the European in any- 
thing, even in salads. However, there can be no 
dispute, for after we have learned what they make 
theie remains the greater question of perfection of 
work, skill, readiness, dexterity, and g)od taste, 
and that will always remain open. Salads made 
only to look at are out of place in a hotel. Orna* 
mentation that consumes hours of time is impracti- 
cable where a new banquet comes on every day. In- 
stead of one great dish of salad we have a hundred 
or two little dishes. Every person at table if he 
chooses has a complete dish to himself. Whatever 
fixing up is to be done must be done quickly or it 
will not be done at all. 



A great oheck might be put upon the vulgar nse ' 
of spurious French in bills of fare if guests and em* 
ployers were to grow inquisitive and quisxical, de- 
manding to know what each word means, of who- 
ever wrote it. There's a nice new game for winter 
time.

THE AMEBICAN COOK. 



729. Dressed Grab. 

Pick the meat from <he shell and olaws, out the 
solid parts into small pieces, dry the soft part with 
the addition of a spoonful of fine bread orumbStmiz 
all with a little oil, Yinesar and mustard. Wash 
and dry the shells and serve the meat in them 
placed on a bed uf something green — ^lettuce, oress, 
young oelery plants or parsley. 



729 a. Potato Salad Plain. 

1 p'nt bowl of cooked and sliced potatoes. 
1 small oiiioui Bl'oed or chopped. 
i cupful of vinegar. Parsley, salt, pepper. 
1 tablespoonful of salad oil, or of fried bac n fat. 
Mix all together by pouring from one bowl to an- 
other and shaking up. 

Hotel Dinner Salads. 



<*Inslpid? Gastronomic heresy ! There is nothing 
better than the potato. I eat them done in all the 
different ways, and should they appear ita the 
second oonrse, whether a la lyonaise or au souffle, I 
hereby eater a protest for the preservation of my 
rights.*' — Savartn, (Mem. To send them in also en 
salade.) 

A thorough first class cook of a first class hotel 
would not like to send to the dinner table the in- 
formal salads of the preceding part, which, however, 
do very well for ordinary supper and lunch, besides 
serving as examples for the employment of the half 
doien salad dressings already described. 



T30. Parisian Potato Salad. 

POMMES PABISIENNB BN MATONAISE. 

Parisian potatoes are so called when scooped out 
of large potatoes with a scoop which forms them in 
balls of the size and appearance of white cherries, or 
a little larger or smaller, for the scoops are sold of 
different sizes. 



1. Make the mayonaise sauce in the quick way 
with bowl and egg-beater, directed in the beginning 
of this book, aod add a tablespoonflU of made mus- 
tard and a very little cayenne. 

Scoop out about two quarts of Parisienne potatoes, 
set them on to boil in cold mik and water with a 
little salt in it, and take them off when just done, 
before they break out of shape. Drain in a colander 
and set away to get cold. 

Also scoop out about a cupfUl of cooked blood 
beets, to match the potatoes, and cover the beet balls 
with vinegar. 

Just before dinner set out flrom 16 to 26 smaU flat 
dishes (for the probable orders of 60 persons with a 
▼Mried bill to choose from). Place a spoonful of 
■wyonaise in a pan or bowl and shake the potatoes 



about in it to coat tl em. Pile 8 or 9 in each dish, 
draw a spoonful of m 'jronaise over so as to mask 
them, and finish by placing with two forks 8 or 4 of 
the beet balls around for ornament. 



2. Large dishes can be put up in the same gen- 
eral way, the beets may then be placed in a row or 
two diagonally across the top, as well, and some 
parsley added, giving the effect of a wreath of ber- 
ries. 

8. It is worth while to know that when the po- 
tatoes are of a mealy sort that break in the water 
they are better simmered till done in freeh butter, 
first melted and poured off the salt sediment, but 
not made fryi g hot. The potatoes are not tx> be 
allowed to become in the least brown, nor even to 
have a hard skin fried on them; only gently stewed 
in butter. The butter can afterwards be used for 
frying, etc. 

4. Instead of repeating, the next time use the 
allemande salad dressing, which, if made with ua- 
colored butter, is pearl white, and ornameot with 
parsley, and a few capers on top, or pickled nasiui^ 
tium seeds or pods, or some piokled red cabbage 
chopped and drained from its vinegar, the beets in 
this case being left out. 



T31. Beet and Potato Salad. 



Gut some cooked blood beets with yi ur sabaiier 
scollop knife into cubes or dice shapes with fiu ed 
sides, and keep the cut shapes in vioegar. 

Prepare some Parisienne potatoes — there hh<uld 
be about a quart of each— and the allemande salad 
dressing. Pile a few of the beet shapes in the mid- 
dle of the dishes, place the potatoes around as a 
border, and with a tablespoon pour the sauce over 
the potatoes, leaving the beets of their natural color. 
Oraament with a hasty sprig of parsley to each 
dish. 



« 'Characterless people who are like salsify th»t in 
always just going to taste like an oyster and never 
does." — Talmage, 

("Was ofieo thought but ne'erso well expressed.*' 
Mem. To give salsify a chance in allemande dress- 
ing.) 



T39. 



Salsify Salad. 



SALSinS EH HATONAISE. 

Wash the salsify roots and shave off the outside, 
throw them in oold water with salt in it and sei 
them on to boil. Try with a fork ro know when 
done. Salsify requires an hour or more to ooob. 
After draining fk-om the hot water put it immedia e- 
ly in a pan of cold to keep it of good color. 



THB AMEBICAN COOK. 



189 



1. Gut the Balsiff aoroBS ia rouDd losenge shapes 
as iifarly rf one size as possible. Pat it in a bowl 
and pour oyer it the allemande salad dressing with 
a little Chili Tinegar mixed in. 

Salsiff is best in the spring of the year, after it 
has had the winter frosts, and garden oress can then 
be had for garnish. Make a border of oress on the 
small flat dish or sauoer and plaoe a spoonftil of the 
salsify and its dressing in the middle. 



2. Gat the salsify ia lengths of about 2 inches, 
not usiog the largest roots for this purpose. Place 
3 or 4 of the pieces on each dish, diagonally across 
the dish, and pour over the pile a spooofUl of thick 
mayonaise. It is better if the pieces of salsify can 
steep in oil and yinegar, enough to moisten them, 
awhile before dinner. 



The cream hoUandaise, or the other dressings, can 
of coarse be used instead of the two preceding, and 
salsify does well to mix in salads wiUi other yegeta- 
bles. 

The making of the allemande dressin is not so 
simple but that it may be' easily spoiled if the oil 
and cream be added too hastily. Probably a half 
cup more of cream will be needed than the re- 
ceipt calls for, and it should not be ice cold nor 
added foster than a spoonfal at a time. This 
dressing is yaluabls for needing no eggs and but 
little oil, and ia suitable for all sorts of yegetables. 



**We Florentines mostly use name^ as we do 
prawns, and strip them of all flourishes before we 
trust them to our throats." — Ramola, 

The prawn is a larger kind of shrimp and for 
the cook's purposes is the same thing. It has 
longer horns, feelers or flourisht s than the shrimp, 
which causes it to be preferred for a buis9<m; it is of 
lighter color when cooked, and in the markets 
umally sells for a lower price than the shrimp. 



T88. 



Shrimp Salad. 



MATOHAISI or SHBIMP8 OB PRAWNS, OB SHBIMPS 
(OBSVETTES) EN MATONAlSB. 

1 Prepare about a quart of shrimps diyested of 
their coat of mail, tails, heads and flourishes, and 
place them in a bowl. 

Make the thm mayonaise or salad cream and pour 
it oyer the shrimps. 

Take some beads of lettuce from the pan of ice- 
water in which they haye lain, shake them free 
from water and shred them as floe as possible with 
a sharp knife, on a clean board kept for the pur- 
pose. About enough to fill a 2 quart pan will do. 

Place a liitle pile of the lettuce in the small, deep 
dish, ice cream saucer or deep glass plate; make a 
hollow in the middle, forming a border of lettuce, 



and in the hollow place a good spoonftil of the 
shrimps and dressing. Dish up these only as need- 
ed, for the lettuce soon dries and loses its color. 



2. Make the thick mayooaise, or else use that 
termed American Falad dressing, made of about the 
same consisienoe. 

Prepare the shrimps, put them in a bowl, poor in 
a basting-spoonful of yinegar, two of oil, a little 
white pepper, and shake about, making the shrimps 
look moist and shiniog. 

Prepare small white he«rts of lettuce, one fur 
each indiyidnal dish, pull them apart and lay the 
leayes slantwise, wreath fashion, around the dish. 
Plaoe a neat spoonful of the seasoned shrimps in the 
center and oyer them pour or spread a spoonftil of 
the mayonaise. 



8. For a large dish like the preceding fill the 
shrimps, atter seasoning with oil and yinegar, into 
a melon mould (a mould in shape of half a melon), 
and slighly press to giye them the shape. Tom 
them out onto a flat dish already prepared with 
leayes of heart lettuce Pour the mayonaise oyer 
the shrimps and decorate with eggs, oUyes, parsley, 
out shapes of beets, flowers, etc. 

4. Haying seasoned the shrimps shape them for 
indiyidual dishes by pressing a spoonftd into a cos- 
tard cup, or egg cup or similar mould. 

Prepare about a quart of celery by chopping it 
fine and seasoning in like manner as the shrimps, 
with oil. yinegar and white pepper, adding a little 
salt also. 

Turn the shrimps on to their dish and plaoe 
around a border of the celery with a teaspoon. 
Finish with a spoonftil of mayonaise on top of the 
shrimps. Or the mayonaise may be dispensed with, 
or, leaye the shrimps without a dressing, and pour 
the allemande dressing frt)m a spoon oyer the celery 
border. 



5. Plaoe a neat spoonftil of shrimps— either sea- 
soned or not, as the time may allow— on the small 
flat dish, and oyer the top spread a spoonful of may- 
onaise. Throw 8 or 4 capers in the center, place 2 
or 8 quarters of hard-boiled egg around, or 3 or 4 
olives, like the beet balls on the potato salad, or u»e 
both, and any other ornament such as cress or 
parsley that may be at hand. 



6. fieverse the order of any of the foregoing, 
when the shrimps are of good shape, and hand- 
somely coiled, by making a pile of shred lettuce or 
chopped celery in ihe middle and placing the 
shrimps around and upon it. A yery pretty mix- 
ture may be made of shrimps in oreM, or water 
oressj without any other dressing.

only interrupted that the guest might quaff Bur-

Perhaps a little &miliariiiog>talk about aspic Jelly 
will do more good than the bald receipt for making 
it alone. For, paradoxically enough, aspic Jelly is 
the one unnecessary article that we cannot possibly 
do without in the kitchen, not in the kitchen of a 
house that aims to be above the garnish of out car. 
rots siyle of Bioomsbury Square. Aspic Jelly is one 
of the barriers, greater a good deal than mayoaalse, 
which bhut off the European style, or, more strictly 
speaking, French cookery from the popular appre- 
ciation and adoption. You have opened a hotcL

foreign cook, but Instead of the decided improve-

most likely, engaged in the preparation of some un-

dishes garnished, ornamented, and he is not the

things and will forget them for a few dayg, to tbe 
great distreea of the oook. And when the/ do oome 
the sealeos fellow who means lo set your house on 
the yery top pinnacle of first classness may be seen 
working at night after all others are in bed doing' 
what seems foolishness— but he is carrying on his 
art And after that supply is exhausted and a new 
lot of ma'erials called for you may witk a« ^siTort 
remember that there was on the taD'ie a dish of cold 
birds in a bed of jelly> whion one or two out of fifty 
persons— a Lothair^ or some suoh stranger — saw and 
admired. Yon will remember the shapes or the 
border ot chopped jelly around the dishes that 
sparkled with it as if set in jewelry, and a boned 
turkey entirely coated with transparent jelly, of 
which somebody sitting near said, '*How pretty/' 
and "Is it good to eat?'* And then perhaps yon 
haTC to think over the ansatisfkotory condition of 
the roasts and the mashed potatoes and conclude 
that Frenoh cookery is one of the things that no 
fellow can noderstand, while the cook, discouraged, 
may be repeatiog some of the words of Monsieur 
Alcibiades Mirobolant aboTe quoted. There is a 
want of mutual understanding in these matters. 
The foreign cook knowing that these extra accom- 
plishments are what make him different from tbe 
home-bread article is apt to magoify their import- 
ance out of all reason, and not being u«ed to count 
the cost of labor and materiftl, is almost sure to take 
the longest way round about to reach the desired 
end. Hotel-keepers w^int French cooks with 
American ways, and American cooks with French 
knowledge. It is French to know how to make and 
how to use aspic jelly. For that reason we cannot 
quite do without making it once a fveek, and this 
regardless ' of whether people call for it or noL It 
is well known that it is not necessary to existence. 
Doctor Tanner quite recently lived forty days aod 
forty nights without once tasting aspic jelly; but it 
is a matter of fashion. It has been seen that aspic 
is mentioned often in the loftiest menus, and the 
initiated are cognisant of aspic in many dishes be- 
sides where it is not mentioned by name. Because 
the leaders on the other side choose, followers on 
this side must. The most delicate flattery of their 
table hotel-keepers ever receive, and geoerally the 
most highly appreciated, is when distinguished 
parties look on admiringly and say, '*Ton employ 
French cooks, don't you?" — ^though perhaps Pompey 
and Dina <*done been done it all tl/emseWes." 
Howerer, distinguished parties never say that when 
the French in the bill of fare is Choctaw. Meat 
jelly in the rough is no foreigner, however, but is 
native everywhere. The Eoglish name is savory 
jelly, aspic is the same refined. This ought to be 
better understood, that the first consideration should 
be to make and keep the jelly savory, so that tbe 
meat it goes with is improved by ir — the jelly com- 
bining several fine flavors and the essence of choice 



game, may be even more delicious and more sought 
after by epicures than the meat itself. That is where 
skill and refinement in cookery oome in. The great 
raised cold pork and venison pies or pastys, the 
brawn and the boars head on the oaken tables of 
Gedric and Athelstane, the Saxon carles ot Ivanhoe, 
were filled and set and solid with aspic jelly in the 
rough. It was the gravy set with its own richness, 
but dark gray and looked as if it wanted straining 
But the earls were invited by the French Prince 
John and his nobles to a feast, and there was a fine 
bird pie, cold, of which the gravy had been clarified. 
The birds were so rare and costly as to be almost 
priceless, and betwixt them the aspic jelly had been 
poured and looked like amber. And even Athelstane 
appreciated the merits of that pie filled with delicate 
aspic, for after he had gobbled the whole business 
he wiped his mouth and asked what that thiog was 
that was so good. Now, we don't want to say that 
aspic jelly, taking it all round, is better than rich 
gravy, but it certainly is far more ornamental, and 
while you are making it to serve with Ui little reed 
birds or rice birds because it is ornamental, take 
cai e it does not get dosed with unsuitable herbs and 
vegetables, and then stick and burn on the bottom, 
and taste worse than scorched beans. The cook and 
confectioner can take the jelly from the pigs-feet keg 
and bring it back looking as clear as glass, and 
when broken it will shine **like dew on the gowan 
lying " but the demands of refined cookery will not 
be satisfied unless it taste as good as it looks. 

184. 

Sometimes there is a remainder of a good looking 
amber dear soup left over that sets in jelly when 
cold, and you say involuntarily to yourself, '*how 
rich that was, and what a pity to throw it away." 
Perhaps it need not be. It will make savory jelly 
for something — for pressed corned beef and the like. 
But when there is a surplus of the broth that fowls 
and turkeys have been boiled in you have as good a 
material for aspic as can be made. Understanding 
this and a little rule or two, the terrors of jelly^ 
making and the dark mysteries of galantines and 
aspic salads will disappear. 

One and a half ounces of gelatine to a quart of 
water will make jelly, or 

One ounce of gelatine to a quart of good broth, and 
less still, the stronger the broth may be. 

One cairs foot boiled in 3 quarts of water will 
make a quart of jelly without any ge'atine. A pig's 
foot and shank does tbe same. Fowls either old or 
young boiled tender in the liquor are necessary for 
good quality. Veal and veal shanks and coarse 
beef are also used, but will not do very well alone. 



''Supper time approaching, Don Quixote retired 
to his apartment, and Sancho inquired of the host 
what they could have to eat. The landlord told 
him his palate should be suited — for whatever the

ftir, earth and sea produced; of birds, beast or fish, 
that inn was abundantly provided with. 'There is 
no need of all that/ quoth Sanoho; 'roast us bat a 
oouple of chiokens, and we shall be satisfied; for my 
master hath a delicate stomach, and I am no glut- 
ton.' 

" *A8 for chickens/ said^the^innkeeper, * truly we 
haye none, , for the kites have deronred them.' 
'Then let a pallet be roasted/ said Sancho; 'only see 
that it be tender/ 'A pullet? my fiktherl* answered 
the host; faith and troth, I sent about fifty yester- 
day to the city to be sold; but ezceptlDg pullets, ask 
for what you will.* 'Why, then,' quoth Sanoho, 
'e'en give us a good joint of veal or kid, for they 
cannot be wanting.' 'Veal or kid7' replied the host, 
'ah, now I remember we have none in the house at 
present, for it is all eaten; but next week there will 
be enough and to spare.' 'We are much the better 
for that/ answered Sancho; 'but I dare say all 
these deficiencies will be made up with plenty of 
^gs and bacon.* ' 'Fore heaven,' answered the 
host, <my customer is a choice guesserl I told him 
I had neither pullets nor hens, and he expects me 
to have eggs! Talk of other delicacies, but ask no 
more for hens.' 'Bodyofmel" quoth Sancho, 'let 
ns come to something — tell me in short what you 
have, Master Host, and let us have done with your 
flourishes.' 'Then,' quoth the inkeeper, 'what I 
really and truly have is a pair of cow-heels, that 
miy be taken for calves' feet; or a pair of calves' 
j^t that are like cow-heels. They are stewed with 
peas, onions and bacon, and at this very moment 
are crying out, 'come eat mel come eat mel' 'From 
this moment I mark them as my own,' quoth 
Sancho; 'let nobody lay a finger on them. I will 
pay you well, for there is nothing like them — give 
me but cow-heel, and I care not a fig for calves' 
feet.' "—Don Quixote. 



T85. 



Aspio Jelly. 



To make savory jelly, take 
12 pounds of meat and feet. 
12 quarts of water. 
12 hours to boil them gently. 

12 oloves. 

1 bay leaf. 

1 small turnip. 

1 small onion. 

1 carr jt. 

1 rounded tablespoonfhl of pepper. 

1 do do salt. 

8 to 6 lemons, juice only. 

6 eggs to olariQr the jelly. 
As has been already intimated it makes but little 
difference in ordinary life what kind of meat is used. 
For choice we will say 2 calves' feet, 2 pigs' feet 
with the shanks attached, 2 old fowls and some veal 
bones or shin of beef. Chop and break the pieces. 



Put them on in a boiler having a false bottom to 
prevent burning, or, otherwise, put a pie plate in 
before the meat. Fill with cold water. Bring to a 
boil and skim o£f what rises to the top. Then push 
the boiler to the back part of the range, and let sim- 
mer gently about 12 hours. It should by that time 
be reduced to about a third of the quantity of water 
first put in and will set in jelly when cold. But 
duriog the time of cooking the vegetables and salt 
and pepper should h|kve been added. White pepper 
is best, whole black pepper, broken a little, is next, 
and if yon have not these ground black pepper will 
do. 

Stndn off your 4 quarts of jelly and fht, from the 
meat and bones, and set it away to get quite cold. 
Then take off the grease from the top, and wipe off 
the last particles with a cloth dipped in warm water. 
Now melt the jelly in a good siied kettle or bright 
tin pan. Squeeie in some lemon juice— enough to 
give it a tart taste. Of the si i eggs Uke 2 entire, 
4 whites, and all the 'shells, and a cup of cold water, 
beat them up, add them to the melted jelly and beat 
up to mix. Then boil — about half an hour will be 
right. 

One reason of trouble in making jelly is the white 
ofegg does not get cooked enough, but runs like 
milk through the jelly bag and makes the jelly 
cloudy when it should be clear. If it boils over too 
much set the kettle and all in the oven till the white 
ofegg has become a gray curd; then it will strain 
clear. 

Another trouble is when you try to do without 
lemons the jelly very often is gummy and will not 
run through flannel, nor hardly through a seive. 
An acid cuts it and makes it limped. If you must 
use vinegar instead of lemon juice, you must. It 
will have the same effect — to make the jelly mn 
through. 

The jelly bag is made of red flannel-^about a yard 
— a wire ring to hold the top open — the bag running 
down to a point, ftinnel shaped. Suspend it by 
strings Uke the bail of a bucket. 

The clarifying process above may of course be 
applied to any soup stock or gelatine liquor, and 
applies with more force to sweetened JeUiee, 
which are harder to make than aspic. 

The aspic may be cooled on dishes, of right 
depth to stamp out fkncy shapes when cold. The 
color will likely be light straw color. A few drops 
of burnt sugar caramel will make it amber and a 
few more brandy or ale color. A few drops of 
red coloring will make pink of the dear and poit 
wine color of the brown. 

The other way will come more Ikmiliarly h<»ne 
to hotel cooks where the stock boiler is the al- 
ways ready resource.

T36. Aspic Jelly.— Hotel Method. 

Draw otf 4 quansof clear soup stock from ths 
stock boiUr. It has already beea lightly seasoned 
with the common TegetableM, and for this use should 
have a bead « f celery aod a handful of parsley ex- 
tra. Cbop about 2 pounds of lean beef fine like 
sausage. Mix a pint of cold water with it, then 
put the beef in the 4 quarts of stock and boil it a 
short lime. Strain this consomme from the beef 
through a fine gra^y straitier, and set it in the 
refrigerator that the grease may be all taken off 
when cold. 

Then add to it the whites and shells of 6 eggs, 
juice of 4 lemons, 1 bay leaf, a tableepoonfui of 
bruised pepper corns, or some while pepper, the 
same of salt, a ladleful of cold water beaten in the 
eggs, and 4 ounces of the cheap, white gelatine, 
that floats while dissoMng and can't bum. Bring 
the mixture to a boil, with frequent stirring. 
When done pour it 8 or 4 times through the Jelly 
tag. 



Now we haye a pail of sayory jelly in the ice 
chest always ready, and can go along with the salad- 
makiog. 



T3T. Shrimps in Aspic. 

ASPIC OP SHBIMPS Om PRAWNS. 

€k>od aspic or savory jelly is a really pleasant con* 
diment with shrimps and the like as well as very 
pretty ornament, but someone remarks in a common* 
sense way that it ought to be fish jelly instead of 
meat jelly. 

1. Pick a quart of shrimps and keep the largest 
and shapliest for this purpose, laying aside the 
broken pieces for fish sauce, etc Shake up the 
shrimps in oil and Tinegar enough to make them 
shine. 

Chop some bright amber-colored jelly. Slice ex- 
tremely fine, or chop— only just before it is to be 
used — some green lettuce, cress and mustard, or 
celery with half green tops, as may be conyenient, 
and season with oil, yinegar and salt. 

Put a spoonful of the green salad in each small 
dish and form a border with it. In the middle 
place a spoonful of the chopped jelly well spread 
out, and on that, well in the center, not to hide the 
border of jelly, place a spoonful of shrimps. Take 
up a little more of the chopped jelly on a silver fork 
and striking dredge it all oyer tbe dish. 

2. Melt some jelly and add lo it a flayoringof 
pepper s«uce, Ha'f ird sauce (poured o£f clear with- 
out dregs) and one drop of red coloring. 

Spread the shrimps close together and only two 
deep on the largest sised meat platter, pour enough 
of the jelly oyer just to cement tbe shrimps together 
and set the dish in tbe reflngerator to get cold. 

When to be dished up cut the shrimps in jelly in 
oakes, either with a sharp knife in oblongs, tri- 



angles, squares, or diamonds, leaving no residue, oz 
wiih a round or oval cutler. 

Dish up in combination with a green salad bor- 
der. One oblong cake on a bed of crew. Two 
small triangles set up against a pile of salad in tbe 
middle. 

8. The last is one of the speedy if somewhat 
rough*and-ready ways that are always practicable, 
while this takes time. 

Prepare a small bowl of chopped green lettuce, 
about a pint may do, and moisten it with some salad 
dressing. 

Pour a spoonfhl of flavored jelly in each one of 
about 25 slender conical shaped wine glasses, or 
moulds like them, let it run all around to coat the 
sides, stick the shrimps in order upon the jelly, and 
let it set in a odd place. When about two rows 
have been put in place, put a teaspoonful of the 
chopped lettuce in the cavity, and the shrimps 
dipped in jelly, on the point of a fork, can be 
placed in the upper rows easily. Fill up with the 
prepared lettuce and pour a spoonful of jelly on top 
of that and be sure the moulds stand level while the 
jelly is setting. The moulds or glasses have to be 
placed in ice water when the weather is not cold. 

To dish up, dip the mould a moment in warm water, 
wipe the outside and shake the shape of jellied 
shrimps out onto a bed of cress in its dish. Stick a 
plume of fennel or a flower in the top of the cone. 

4. The stsmping works now turn out a great 
variety of fhncy shapes of gem pans, some in form 
of scallop shells, that are well adapted for moulding 
these individual aspics in, and are less troublesome 
than border moulds. There is no good reason why 
this day's dinner should be just like any other day's 
dinner in these little ornamental accessories. 



138. 



Oyster Salad. 



6 dozen f^h oysters. 

6 heads of celery with part of their green tope. 

About half as much tender white cabbage. 

The m%yonaise salad dressing. 

1. Make the mayonaiee with Umon juice instead of 
vinegar— or use the juice of 2 lemons, 1 tableepoon- 
fui of tarragon vinegar and a little pepper sauce or 
chili »vinegar. 

After wasl.ing the celery and cabbage throw thell^ 
into boiling salted water, let them boil not less than 
5 nor more than 10 minutes, then drain and cover 
with cold water, then drain dry and chop them 
fine. 

The green celery leaves acquire an intenser green 
in the boiling water, and chopped with the stalks 
and roots give a tinge to the whole. 

Drain the liquor firom the oysters and bring it to 
aboil in order to remove the scum either by skim- 
ming or straining. After that add to it an equal 
quantityof good vinegar, a seasoning of broken 



104 



THB AMERICAN OOOK. 



pepper-corns, pepper eaaoe and salt, then pat in the 
oysters and briog ihem/tM^ to the boiling point and no 
more. Shake the sauoepan continnallj that the 
oysters may beoome set while cooking in round aod 
plamp shape. Then drain them from the liquor and 
set them away on a dish to become ice-eold. 

When to be dished seeson the chopped celery, 
etc., with oil and yinegar, slightly, but well mixed 
in, spread a spoonful of it in the middle of each 
small dish, on tbat lay some oysters side by side, 
and on top another spoonftd of the celery. Flatten 
the top slightlybutdon't smooth the sides. Pour 
the mayonaise oyer just thin enou to run. 

The foregoing Is fio< enough for the avenge orders 
of fifty persons. 

2. Prepare the ingredients as aboTC— but the 
allemande salad dressing or any other may be used 
as well. 

Fry some outside leaTce of lettuce, twice as many 
as you expect to use that you may select those 
which are the most like shells in shape and of the 
finest green-bronxe color after Arying. Good sweet 
lard should be used made hot in the potato ftryeri 
but not smoking hot. The leayes take about a 
minute or two to fry green colored but dry. When 
done lay them hollow side down on baking sheets 
aod let them drain perfectly in a hot place, then let 
them become cold. Shape little oyster (or lobster) 
salads in egg cups, and dish them up in these crisped 
lettuce leayes like a fish in a shell. Spread dressing 
over as usual. 

T39. Aspio of Oysters. 



Prepare the oysters as for salad by scalding (hem 
in seasoned Tinegar and oyster liquor. 

Prepare some green aspio jelly (ravigote jelly) by 
boiling some green celery leaves done, draining dry, 
pounding, mixing with clear aspio and then strain- 
ing it again. Cool the green jelly in the smallest 
flat dishes — it is to form foundations to lay the 
oysters on. 

Boil some eggs hard and chop the yolks for border 
ornament. Now place about four oysters diagonally 
side by side in the smallest flat dish, and pour oTor 
enough clear white or amber jelly, highly eeasoned 
with pepper sauce and lemon juice, to nearly cover 
them. When all are cold slip the shapes of green 
jelly from their dishes by means of a knife and 
place them bottom side up on the dishes they are to 
be serrtd in, then the sbape of oysters on tbat and 
ornament with the minced yolks or tiny leaTCS of 
heart lettuce. 

"Alleys of scarlet tomatoes, purple mulberries, 
giapee, lemons, oranges, quinces, pumpkins. 



'melons ; gourds of all shapes, sites, and colors, green 
and pinky and yellow and violet ; pearly rice from 
the fields about M%ntua; and ungronnd main, like 
beads of clouded amber. Flowers are in proftisioa 
— roses, camellias, and autumn violets; besides 
mountains of mulberry leaves for sUk-worm breed- 
en, pine cones for firing, flat baskets piled high 
with wrinkled olives, and sacks of shining brown 
chestnuts. 

'^Giving smile for smile, greeting for greeting, La 
Giulietta meanwhile makes her modest purchases ; 
lettuce and cress and sweet fonnel for salad : lentils 
and a handfUl of tawny fungi for soup ; a little pat 
of ft«sh butter wrapped in mulberry leaves; and the 
proffered morsel of stracchino for Uncle Sie&no's 
supper." — An Italian Marketplace. — Lord Bracken' 
bwy. 

"Another species of fonnel, called finocohio by the 
Italians, is also ueed for the same purposes, and a« a 
flavoring for soups.*' — Baaar, 

"In a comer, far away ftrom any group of talk- 
ers, two mutes were standing, well adorned with 
red tassels and collars. One of them carried wooden 
milk-veesels, the other a pair of panniers filled with 
herbs and salads. « * • * Nevertheless 
our stranger had no compuoction in awaking her, 
but the means he chose were so gentle that it seemed 
to the damsel in her dream as if a little sprig of 
thyme had touched her lips while she was stooping 
to gather the herbs.'* — An Italian Marketplace, — 
Romola, 

"Would you kindly get those Soissons haricots 
fotched, which I see at the end of the table. * * 
* * I beg also your favorable notice for the 
small marsh beans, sometimes called English beans; 
when still green they are a dish for the gods." — 
Savarin, 

* It is said that we are indebted to Alexander the 
Great for the introduction of this bean into Europe, 
for while marohiog on his victorious route in India 
his eye fell upon a field of these plants. They ap- 
peared lo him very inriting, and finding them good 
for food he highly recommended them to his coun- 
trymen." 

"The Romans preserved them with vinegar and 
garum, and they were handed round at the begin- 
ning of a feast to excite the appetites of the guests." 

"About Bari? Surely — a seaport on the Adriatic 
coast. You may see plenty of Bari trading vessels 
at Ancona and Venice. Our neighbor Sacch«, who 
understands the wholesale business as well as any 
man in town, gets all his oil from Bari. Being 
brought by sea to Venice, it comes cheaper than the 
oils of Florence and Luces, which have to be 
brought across the Apennines. Don't you know

pretty women 7 * *' — Lord Braekenbury,

Salade Jardiniere. 



With peat, aspangas points and other green 
regetablea really green, beeta blood red, and first- 
rate aspic jelly for border, and flowers, nothioggoes 
to table that is more showy than this. 

Gat a number of diflferent oolored root TOgetables 
in slices and boll them till done in salted water — a 
white tomip, a yellow rutabags, a red oarrot, salsi- 
fy, parsnip, broad oelery stalks, almost anything for 
Tsriety. 

When done stamp them all out in little star shapes 
or flower shapes, with a tin TOgetable cutter, not 
much larger than a^silrer dime. 

Also stamp out a quantity of the same star shapes 
of cojked beets, the deepest red, and keep them 
ready in Tinegsr, separate. 

Boil a corresponding proportion of asparagus 
heads ^re«i, also, some green peas (unless you can 
get the French peas, and ha?f a can may do), and 
string beans and chives, etc. A small quantity of 
the French ognofu, or smaU seed onions sold in hot- 
ties, is al8<> a desirable addition. Cut the string 
beans in diamond shapes. 

Mil all these Tegetables, except the beets and a 
spriniLling of the peas or asparagus points, together 
with enough oil and yinegar to moisten, and turn 
them from one bowl to another a few times. 

Pile in the middle of the dishes, and pour thin 
mayonaise oyer, aud scatter the star shapes of beeta 
and the green peas all oyer the top. 

Around the edge of the dishes place blocks of am 
ber jelly, lettuce leayes, tiny bunches of cress, flow- 
ers, etc., all or part, according to fhncy. 

The jelly should be cooled in dishes, in depth 
about half an inch, cut in perfect cubes, then cut . 
across, to form three-sided blocks. For all these 
ornamental purposes it is generally necessary to 
clarify the aspic jelly a second time— it makes it 
firmer and of a more golden richness of appearance. 
All things in this class are for style. Good work- 
manship tells. Better never attempt them at all 
than make them but tawdry imitations. 

T41« To Boil Veffotables QreeiL 



Let asparagus, peas and string beans lie in cold 
water an hour or two before cooking, then put them 
into water that is already boiling, but just before 
putting , them in, drop a little bi-carbonate of soda 
into it. A pinch of carbonate of ammonia does as 
well. Too much of either makes the vegetables soft 
and yellow. 

. The French green peas— ^e(ttej9ow — are better 
than ours, chiefly because they are gathered while 
young enough, so, likewise, are the English, but 
American peas never are — except in California. 



The French petiU pots are made so green by tbe 
addition of a small quantity of Vichy salt to the 
water they are canned in, an alkaline salt firom the 
f4mous springs. Bi-carbonate of soda with salt has . 
about the same effect. 

Spinach, summer cabbage, Brussels sprouts and 
the like are kept green while boiling by the ssme 
treatment as asparsgus and peas. Green celery 
leaves — ^useful in salad making — need no alkali to 
green then, the boiling water is sufficient. 

T4». 

When using the coarser outside stalks of celery 
for sny purpose that requires them to be cooked 
sorape the tough sinews from the back — much as 
you would scale a fish— and tbe celery will be great> 
ly improved. 

T48. 

"Heliveth well wholoveth well 
All things both great and small." 

— Ancient MaHner, 

" 'Are you a fkvorer of the olive 7* said Lord G— . 

<No,' said I, *I love^it.not ; it hath an under taste 
of sourness and an upper of oil, that do not make 
harmony to my palate*' " — Bulwer. 

In the taladejardiniere, and the two next to come, 
you can put away that bottle of queen olives — in the 
jardimere as a border ornament instead of jelly, and 
in the others as part of their composition, and be 
done with the perplexity. Fur it is perplexing, 
seeing the queen olive's visits to the kitchen are so 
fbw and fiir between, to have somebody set the bot- 
tle on the table in a perfectly matter-of-course way 
saying, "As we want this to be a very nice affair 
yon can have some olives for your salad,'* and then 
walk off*. Now what are you to do with queen 
olives to be fine for all they are worth? Tou have 
heard of a gentleman who is at all the outside par- 
ties and festivals where you have to send your con- 
tributions of boned turkeys and roast hams and 
things, who is a terror because he is a critic, and 
who always at|those places makes the people a salad 
with olives. And it is the olive part that gives the 
impression of style, wherefore you likewise must 
do something great, and there's your bottle of olives. 

Now you wish your people were Italians, to eat 
their olives plain, like these in Loihair: 

*'0n this mom, this violent morn, a few fishermen 
in one of the country boats happened to come in, 
about to dry a net upon a sunny bank. Lothair ad- 
mired the trim of the vessel, and got talking with 
the men as they ate their bread and olives, and a 
small fish or two." 

Or like these in Lord Brackenbury : 

"So La Giulietta hurries in to spread the table ; 
and presently they are all sitting together at their 
evening meal — a meal literally of Attic simplicity, 
oonsisUng of bread, salad, salted olives, a kind of 
sweet cake made with chestnut flour, and a measure 
I of country wine in a wicker flask*'

THE AMERICAN COOK. 



Or like tb«se in Don Quixote : 

"They were all good-lookiog young fellows ; each 
hid his wallet, which, as it eoon appeared, was well 
stored, at least with relishing incentiYes to thirst, 
and suoh as provoke it at two leagues distance. 

They laid themselves along on the ground, and, 
making the grass their table-dot h, there was 
presently a comfortable display of bread, salt, nuts, 
and cheese, with some bacon bones, which, though 
they would not bear picking, were to be sucked 
with advantage. Caviare too was produced— a kind 
of black eatable, made of the roes of fish : a notable 
awakener of thirst. Even olives were not wanting, 
and though somewhat dry, they were savory and in 
good keeping. But the glory of the ftost was six 
bottles of wine." 

An English authority, too, advising on the make- 
up of a supper, says it will be as well to provide a 
few olives for the gentlemen ; but means them plain, 
in pickle dishes. 

In a little menu of an ancient dinner of Washing- 
ton's, recently discovered among the fiunily relics, 
that was printed in the Reporter, olives plain ap- 
pears twice. However, our gentleman makes salads 
with olives in. 

Etailade de Leffumes, a ritalienne. 

A match to ih^ jardiniere salad, and, like it, made 
ofseveral varieties of vegetables cut in forms. No 
mayonaise needed unless for ornamental piping, 
like icing patterns on a cake. The distinctive 
feature is the border-mould of vegetable patterns 
and mosaics set in jelly ; in the hollow center the 
plainer colored vegetables being piled, seasoned only 
with oil, salt, pepper, and tarragon vinegar. As 
the large moulds are almost useless for individual 
setsdce, and even at parlies are seldom if ever cut, 
the writer uses individual border moulds, which 
any tinner can make. They are of Bize and shape 
to fit the smiU dishes, from 2} to 8 inches long» and 
form a trench or border an inch deep, the jelly, etc., 
moulded therein forming a rim for the dish, the 
centre beiog vacant. 

1. Take a scollop scoop— not too small and tedi- 
ous — one that scoops a sort of oblong shell shape or 
berry out of vegetables — and scoop about a cupftil 
of potatoes raw, and then cook them in salted water. 
Also a cupful of cooked beets, same shape, and per- 
haps other vegetables, and a like quanti y of shapes 
of white of eggs. Prepare likewise some cooked 
string beans by cuttiog them of same length, and 
stone a bot tie of olives. 

8^t the small border moulds in a pan that itr set in 
another pan of ice, water, and salt. Drop 8 or 4 
olives in each and fill in between with the mixed 



colored shapes of vegetables and white of eggs, and 
fill up with amber aspic jelly. 

While the borders are setting prepare the inride 
filling. Choore cauliflower, potatoes, asparagus, 
beets, and green peas ; cook them, divide the c uli- 
flower into small flowerets, oat the potatoes and 
beets in very small dice, use only the green heads 
of the asparagus, season them all with tarragon 
vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. Turn the jelly bor- 
ders out of their moulds and pile the other mizture 
in the middle. 

2. Another way without border moalda is to 
spread the mixed shapes of vegetables and egg white 
over a large platter, pour on jelly to cover them, 
and, when set, wii ha sharp knife cut across in 
diamonds, and then divide these across forming 
triangles, careftilly without dragging and displacing 
the vegetables. Take np these triaoglei with sugar 
tongs and dipping one edge in melted jelly set them 
up around the dish, and fill the ceotre as in the 
other. The olives m«y be used mixed in the centre 
filling, or as ornaments, alternating with the jelly 
shapes. 



Huge salads of this kind are made for banquets 
and baU suppers, sometimes in pyramidal form, the 
sides of the moulds elaborately decorated with pat- 
terns of white of eggs (that has been steamed in a 
mass shallow in a pan, for large leaves, etc , to be 
stamped cut), and asparagus set up in jelly in full 
length, with white and red roses of turnips and 
beets. These are ornamental pieces and for ndthing 
else. 



The honeycombed vegetables left after cutting or 
scooping can be steamed and mashed, the beets can 
often be chopped and used in another salad. 

There are knives rf peculiar shape sold for 
stoning olives. It makes a difierence if the olives 
be the large kind and not such as now sometimes 
come in kegs. 



T45. Salade a la Busae. 

Various mixtures of fish and vegeiabies, with 
olives, pickles, capers and the like are called Ras- 
eian salad, the disiinguishing feature, however, is 
the Russian salad dressing of highly (ea«oned jelly 
whipped to a froth. The gelatine maoufacturers have 
caused to be pretty well known certain sweet trifles 
made by whippiog lemon y\y whi!e cooling on ice 
10 a froth resembling white of egg«, aod then called 
lemon snow, snow pudding, aod the like. These 
are known as Russian jel'y or jelly a laRusse in 
French cookery. The Ru«8ian salad jelly is the 
same thing with salad seasonings instead of sweets. 
It may be either white, red, green or yellow ; and

when ornamental border moulds are made with it 
the yariatioDS are to get rrd fleshed fishes such as 
lobster?, shrimps and salmon to show in the white 
jelly, and white fish and sometimes chicken, scalded 
oysters and the like, to show in colored jelly. 
OliTfs, capers, green gherkins and pickled peppers 
are always in place in Russian salads, and cayiare 
is good fur their ornamentat'on. The inside of the 
border shapes may be filled with any mixture of 
Tegetables, like the Italian Tegeiable salad, and 
mayonaise poured over. 

Where so much depends upon indiyidual taste it 
seem? useless to giTe minute directions. 

To make the jelly melt a pint of good firm aspic 
jelly, then whip it with an egg beater, in a pan of 
ice water, adding at the same time a quarter pint of 
oUys oil and a little less of mixed yinegars— chili 
and tarragon— or lemon juice and some plain 
yinegar. To make the jelly yery white whip one or 
two whites of eggs to a froth and stir them in just as 
it begiDS to be too firm to beat. 

The red fishes should be cut in pieces of eyen sise, 
mixed in the jelly, together with the oliyes, capers 
and shapes of pickles, and the moulds immediately 
filled. A good effect m<iy be produced by dropping 
into the white jelly Uitle cubes of clear jelly of 
different colors. 

To color this whipped jelly red use beet yinegar, 
or lobster spawn pounded and rubbed through a 
fineeeiye. For yellow mix mayonaise dre.-sing in 
it instead of oil and yinegar. For green use the 
juice pressed out of pounded raw spinach leayes, or 
of cooked celery leayes. 

Stone the oliyes and fill them with chopped mixed 
pickles before putting them in the salad. 



If the lobster holds the most prominent place 
among salads we guess it must be because the Old- 
World cooks, puryeyors. mejor-domos and kings' 
tasters haye thrust it forward for its bright color to 
make their set tables look like pio:urei>. Looking 
back through an American cooking experience if 
about thirty yeirs the writer has never had reason 
to regard it as particularly delicious eating. Con- 
spicuous in the foreign menu cerihiaiy, but who 
can sjll to mind where any wiiter has eulogized 
lobster salad or held up the lobster for anything but 
a comparison fur somebody's red face? Somewhere 
Thackeray who mentions eyery thing eatable, and 
each at its proper style of table, and who knew wh^t 
was good, mentions lobster and lobster salad, but in 
both places they are in the hands of low-down per- 
sons ; one of them in a dusty place at a fiur. 

V46. Lobster Salad. 

MATONAISB DB HOMABD, ETO. 

1. The largest quantity of lobster can be dis- 
posed of at hotel tables by serying it (after taking 



the meat out of the shell) plain, with only a little 
good yineg%r poured oyer in the dish, and 2 or 3 
criep leayes of heart lettuce. It is one of the 
pleasures of the table for some people to make their 
own salads. 



2. Gut the lobster as nearly in dice shape as may 
be, leaying the scraps and crumbs to be used fof 
some other purpose — as fish saucs croquettes, lob- 
ster outlets, etc. — and mix it with an equnl quantity 
of boiled potatoes out to correspond, in the hollao- 
daise salad dressing. Use shred lettuce to garnish. 



8. Chop 6 or 8 heads of white celery and stir in* 
to it a Utile oil, yinegar, popper and salt. 

Select enough fine large pieces of the lobster meat 
for about 25 indiyidual dishes ; steep them in oil, 
yinegar, pepper and salt in a bowl, and dish one or 
two pieces laid diagonally on a spread out spoonftil 
of the celery. 



4. Prepare the mayonaise salad dressing with 
lemon juice insiead of yinegar, or part of the yine- 
gar. 

Chop six heads of celery with enough of the tend- 
erest green tops mixed in to make it all light green. 
Cut the lobster in pieces all of one sise and keep out 
the reddest meat in a dish by iteelf. 

Dish a layer of the chopped celery in flat indiyid- 
ual dishes ; then lobster on that with the red pieces 
strewn at the edge where they will show among the 
green ; then another spoonfUl of celery on top of the 
lobster, and press down the top slightly. Pour the 
mayonaise oyer just thin enough to run and mask 
without hiding the colors; These salads look like 
tufts of moss. 



5. Steep the lobster in oil, yinegar, pepper and 
salt. Dish on flat dishes, spread thick mayonaise or 
other dressing on top, and decorate with quarters 
of boiled eggs, oliyes, pickles, capers, chopped let- 
tuce, etc., as for shrimp salads. 



Lobsters, crabs, crayfish and shrimps are all 
cooked by dropping them aliye into boiling water, 
sailed. It is the old world fashion of the fishermen 
who bring in the daily market supply of shrimps, 
to boil them in sea water, on their way in. They 
haye boilers set in brick work in their boats for the 
purpose. And so, it is said, do the lobster fishers of 
Gaspe Bay, where lobsters do most abound. 
Shrimps take but a few minutes to cook, lobsters 
take half an hour and more.

THB AJUEBICAX COOK. 



The lobster coral or spawn, if these ftmished 
happen to coDtain any, can be used, pounded and 
rubbed through a Feive, to mix with majODaise to 
giTe it a red oolor and serve for yarietj in ornamen- 
tation. Another great use of the ooral is to make 
lobster butter by pounding it with an equal amount 
of fresh butter and rubbing through aseive. Add 
some lemon juioe and chopped parsley. A tolerable 
substitute is the red claw meat of the lobster. This 
butter is used for spreading on bread or toast to 
build up salads on, and for sticking Urge pieces of 
lobster together. If seldom eaten it may be that 
the nature and composition of red butter is not gen- 
erally understood. HoweTer, it goes well as a cold 
sauce with hot fish, and in that way is never wasted. 

Then there is green Muce. Just lately I was 
trapped into reading a bill of fiare. It was a Christ- 
maa bill, printed large, and set in a restaurant 
window among tbe ornamented dishes of an evident- 
ly good cook, and the novelty of H was salmon with 
green sauce. Why green sauce instead of rangoU, 
remoulade, McntpeUier, or something else that con* 
veys no picture to the mind T But green sauce 
stretches away back to the time of the old Romans, 
and perhaps beyond them to the Babylonians and 
Persians. 

■ Here, comparatively recent, yet written three 
hundred and seventy years ago, is a French book 
talking about green sauce : 

" <It is,' said Panurge, 'my lords the king of the 
clouted hose. I intend to make him an honest man. 
I will put him to a trade, and make him a crier of 
green-sauce. Go to, begin and cry ; Do you lack 
any green-cauce? And the poor devil began to 
cry. 

Truly, green sf^oe might mean "garden-sass" or 
other things, but here are particulars : 

"Pantagruel gave them a little lodge near the 
lower street, and a mortar of stone wherein to bray 
and pound their sauce." 

It must be inferred (hat green-sauce has at some 
times been cried as a marketable article like pop- 
corn. Qreen sauce, the simple base, in modern 
French cookery is called ravigoU, and consists of 
some half dozen kinds of herbs — tarragon, chives 
parslpy, bumet and others, pounded to a green 
pulp and then pressed though a seive. Of this 
Ude, and then G ireme made a dozen diff.-rent com- 
binations in hot sauces, like mint sauce with roast 
lamb, and cold green sauces and butters. Some of 
these are used solely for salads, Montpelier butter 
pfcrtioularly, spread on toast as an ornamental 
border or foundation for lobster and fish. The ex- 
pres«ed juice of pounded spinach leaves is relied 
upon for coloring a deeper green, and boiled oelery 
leaves will answer as well. These sauces and con- 
diments are not likely to become Americanized be- 
cause of the danger of ignorant cooks using artificial 
green colorings, which are nearly all poisonous. 



V48. Lobster in the SheU. 

Divide the lobster in convenient«sed pieces, craek 
the daws with a hammer, and serve plain ; the best 
pieces only, the frasments can be put to other uses. 
Send in a quarter of lemon on each dish. 

Buisson of Ijobstera or Prawna 

The buiuan or bush of lobsters, so often appear- 
ing in menus of banquets, is the same as would be a 
pyramid of anything else. It is an ornamental 
style of serving lobster in the shell for a large num- 
ber, and sometimes the smallest lobsters are chosen 
for the purpose. The ways are various. The lob- 
sters are fastened overlapping each other, tails up- 
wards, in pyramidal form on a tall and slender 
evergreen bush — a Christmas tree in effect — with 
their claws, horns and eyes looking out menacingly 
from among the green. Another way is to make a 
pyramid of pressed oomed beef incased in jelly and 
stick the lobsters in like form on that with silver 
headed skewers, filling in with greens and flowers. 
Prawns on the same plan and smaller scale Little 
pyramids of shrimps and prawns are made by cut- 
ting a long loaf of bread in pineapple shape and 
stiokiag the unpicked shrimps all over it by their 
horns. Picked shrimps are similarly made to cover 
tall shapes mou?ded in cold butter. There is plenty 
of room to depart from these suggestions and fur- 
nish new designs. 

**What a pleasure it is to have a good appetite, 
when one is certain of soon having an excellent din*

Some hotels now make a public exhibit of their 
Christmas meats and delicacies. I think sometime 
there will be a new fashion of parting off a portion 
of the dining room with a glass partition, in which 
room, as through a shop window, the eompul<.orJly 
idle guests instead of watching the clock hand drag 
its slow length along will be allowed to see going on 
the cleanly and fireless process of salad making and 
decoration ; the construction of the latest novelties 
in confeciioneries and boquets of fruits ; the oma-« 
mentation of boned turkeys and the like after new 
designs furnished by the Lrkkeside Society of Deoora- 
live Art— Culinary Bianch. Then the dining roim 
will not be so wrapped in a dim religious light, and 
so formidably closed and bolted but that the rirp- 
pered stewards and waiters may be seen busy with 
their preparations for the good dinner to oome

T50. Fish Salad. 

FILLETS or FISH EN MAT0MAI8B. 

1. The kinds of fish U at will full apart in flakes, 
Buoh as silmoD, turbot, ba^but, redfish, and fresh 
ood may be made ia salads ia the same ways as 
lobsters, shrimps and oysters, already directed. 
But table sauces, ketchups, soy, and essence of an* 
ehoTies, can be added to the dressings according to 
taste. 

Of India soy Sayarin says : <*It seems likely the 
Roman garum was a foreign sauce ; perhaps even 
the *soy' which we get from India, and which is 
known to be got by the fermentation of a mixture of 
fish and mushrooms." 

151. 

2. fillets offish are the whole sides freed from 
bones and skin. For individual dishes cut these 
into smaller fillets, abont the size of fingers. Lay 
them to steep a while in oil, Tioeg^r, pepper and 
salt, and dish on a bed of chopped celery. Then 
OTer each fillet pour a spoonful of mayonaise. 

8. For a msyoDaise of fillets of soles or brook 
trout : Skin the fish before cocking, and likewise 
split down the back and take the bones out. Boll 
the boned fish up in finger shape and lay tbem close 
together in a pan. Pour in some broth with a dash 
of Tinegar, salt, white pepper, a piece of onion and 
some parsley. Cover with a bright fiat lid, put bat- 
tered paper oyer that and cook in the oven 20 or 80 
miDutes. There should be little or no liquor left in 
the pan. Put a small weight on the lid to press the 
fillets, and set them away to get cold. 

When to be made in mayonaise trim the ends off. 
Moisten the fillets with oil and vinegar in a bowl, 
and build them up, if for a large di»h, around a 
conical pile of chopped celery or lettuce and pour 
the dressing over all. Garnish with lemons. 



tfk^. 



Bolllnff Fish. 



The get- along-wit bout policy of neglecting to pro- 
vide the kitchen with necessary utensils operates 
serious y against good cookery in average hotels. 

There is no question but that in the fitting up of 
every new hotel some money is wasted in buying 
useless articles to suit«the cranks and notions of the 
chef that is going to take charge— things like costly 
copper moulds, bain maries, patent machines, etc, 
which none of his successors in the same place will 
ever use, and proprietors having had experience' of 
snch follies are apt to take a grim revenge by re- 
fusing to buy any uncommon article at all. Now 
there must be, and it pays to have in the kitchens 
even of small and UDpretentious houses, a fish boi'er 
with its drainer or false bottom and hooked upright 
at each end to lift it and the fish out by ; a stock 
boiler with its folse bottom and fiiucet; a potato 
fryer with its suppended drainer ; a time-saving 



large coffee mill, and other things scarcely le^s im< 
port ant but none of them commonly to be found. 
It pajs" bpcause some of the fiopst fishes are finest 
flavored when boiled, and if they can not be for 
want of the proper appliances they have to suffer 
deterioration by more ei pensive frying and baking. 
A fish may be boiled in a stove wash-boiler and 
fished out with two sliimmers, but no company will 
insure it against breakage. What must be must, 
and in such a case you had better mil up the fi«h in 
a dem pudding-cloth, tying the ends and pinning 
the middle, and carefully roll it out on to its dish 
when done. 

Any tinner can make a poissoniere or fi^h boiler. 
It should be long enough for a good eizpd Mackinaw 
trout whole, and wide enough for two or three on 
the drainer. It has sides straight up and a lid. 

To boil a large trout, whitefish, redfish, sheephead 
or salmon for taiad : Scale, and dean the fish, clip 
off the fios but leave the head and tail on, and lay it 
in a pan of cold water. Draw some clear soup- 
stock into the fish kettle (the stock is already slight- 
ly seasoned with vegetables), to one-third fill it. 
Throw in a basting-spoonful of salt, a tablespoonful 
of pepper-corns, half a bayleaf, a small onion with 
six cloves stuck in it and a small piece of horse- 
radish. A'so a cupftil of wine if afforded, sherry or 
claret — ^keep the cheap sweet angelicas and the like 
for ices and jellies — if no wine half a cup of vinegar 
instead. Let this liquor come to a boil, then wipe 
the fish clean and dry, lay it on the drainer and let 
come to a boil quickly. Then put on the lid and 
move the ketde to the side of the range to simmer 
slowly. Rapid boiling breaks the fish. Too much 
cooking softens it. 

Half an hour is the average time it takes to boil a 
fish just done, but varies according to the size. 
Redfish and salmon, being solid fleshed, bear longer 
boiling than lake trout. Cool the fish in the liquor 
it was boiled in. 

153. 

Redfish, Whitefish or Trout in Aspio . 
Jelly. 



An ornamental dish. Border moulds are needed. 

» 

common jelly moulds will do. 

Take the boiled fish ice-cold from the liquor it 
was boiled in, wipe off with a napkin dipped in hot 
water, peel off the skin ; then wiih broad knives 
split the fish down the back, remove the bone and 
lay the two fillets on a cutting board. It makes the 
handsomest dish to have a red or pink or yellow- 
fleshed ^sh to alternate with the white. 

Get ready a pan of water, ice and SiU (freezing 
mixture) to dip the moulds in to set the jelly quick- 
ly. Cut the fishes in finger-like strips. 

Flavor some melted jelly with chili vinegar and 
table sauce poured off clear, then coat the moulds 
with it by turning a little around in tb«m till set. 



80O 



THE AUEBICAN OOOK. 



Place the pieces of fi-h ia upright order arouod 
the mould with Bometbing to make omameDtal 
stripes betwixt each pi*ce — it may be the chopped 
red meat of lobster, a fine line of chopped yolk oi 
egg, picked shrimps, or chopped parsley or lender 
greea celery leaTes. 

One side of the mould has to be fiuished at a time, 
a liitle jelly poured over aud allowed to set ia the 
ice water, to be (hen turned over and the other side 
lined. With a number of moulds to work on there is 
no tim^ lost. 

For the inside fitting mix aspio jelly and thick 
mnyonaisB in about equal qnantiiies, and beat it 
light on ice; just b<fote ii sets stir in chopped 
ce'ery or white lettuce, or both, and when the fish- 
lined moulds are filled — or the hollow border if 
border moulds be used — ^let them set in a cold place 
till to be served. The dishes should be garnished 
with a border of picked leaves of water cress, and 
something to show it is fish, as shrimps or piecee of 
lobster, or betier still, some of the smallest fish ob- 
tainable, incased in clear Jelly whole, like oysters in 
aspic, and laid in order around. 



A good deal of deteriorated and ill-savored food ia 
sent to hotel tables through the semi-accidentsl fer- 
mentation of soup stocks, liquors in which fish are 
left to cool, and the like, and never so much as 
when the preparation of a banquet requires some 
things to be made a good while before. This is not 
through want of skill in making, but want of care in 
keeping. It is next to impossible for a large kettle 
of fifb boiled over night, or a large body of soup 
stock to remain unchanged till next day, a sort of 
'^salt-rising** fermentarion pets in. This is not to 
run down hotel cookery but point the remedy. 
Always cool off soup stock in several shallow pans 
and stir once in a while, and never set fish away in 
the kettle more than one fish deep ; and the kettle 
should be tipped once or twice while coo log to ex- 
pel the heat from the center. Afier that there is no 
risk of a bad taste. 



And, before we get too far from green sauce: 

There is a book in the British museum all about 

trout, that was written by a cook and published 

within a few years of Izaak Walton's Complete 

Angler. In a rhyming preface the author says : 

* 'Forty years in ambassadors* kitchens I 
Learned the art of cookery. " 

And he hai *Hriiut pie lo eat hui," and "trout pie to 
eat cold,*' and "cold trout in armour of green," in 
which we find the s^me old pounded herbs, or 
ravigote, mixed with butter and seasonings, and 
spread smoothly all over the cold boiltd fidh, which 
is then ornamented with thin sliced pickles to imi- 
tate scales and gills. This is done with truffle slices 
in modem French cookery, and the dish g^es by 
another name. V54. 

Another dish of fish in armor of green, necessary 



for those to be ported in who would get up novel, if 
very old, dishes for banquets is: 

Mix thick mayonaise with a third as mnoh aspio 
jelly and color it green with the juice from pounded 
spinach leaves. When so nearly set as not to run 
spread it evenly over a cold boiled fish raised on a 
bread or chopped celery foundation, and deoorato 
with truffles, whole yolks of eggp, aspie jelly or 
sliced or quartered lemrns. 



For if the salad makers and their work had not 
some strange charm of mysteiy for the public why 
should the novelists make so much use of the man 
who can make a mayonaise 7 

That man is nearly ubiquitous in English fiction^ 
if we had time to follow him — not that mayonaise is 
always as plainly mentioned as in the instance in 
our opening column, but it is implied when not 
named as one of the branches of occult knowledge 
that is to give that personage, who is oflenest a 
valet, a {lold upon your imagination. 

The man who can make a mayonaise, whom every 
reader knows, is done up in the smallest parcel per- 
haps in /*«/» BoU: 

"Oh! one of those wonderfUl Southern fellows 
that make one's life easy. He's of no country in 
particular. I don't know whether he's most of a 
Jew, a Oreek. an Italian, or a Spaniard. He speaks 
five or six languages, one as well as another. He's 
cook, valet, major-domo, and secretary all in one | 
and what's more, he's an affectionate fellow— I can 
trust to his attachment. That's a sort of human 
specimen that doesn't grow here in England, I 
fknoy. » • • » The old servants 
will have t*) put up with my man Dominic, who will 
show them how to cook and do everything else, in a 
way that will rather astonish them.'* 

Here he crops out ia Thackeray's Vtrffimam : 

'*Gumbo had a hundred accomplishments. * * 
* * He was great at cooking mauy of his 
Virginian dishes, and learned many new oulinaiy 
secrets from my Lord's French man " 

Kow we all know those sccrsts were how to make 
a maycnaise or two, but the snthors do not always 
know as much as tl.eir obarMC'ers-^how valuable 
must have been the salad-m«kirg knowlege pos- 
sessed by Count Fosco, in the Woman in White — be 
an Italian, a Count, and with domestic proclivi- 
tiej — ^but which the author forgot to give to the 
world! 

These men of extraordinary knowledge have to do 
other things than make strange dishes for the 
Fiench reader. The same sort of valet or m»jor- 
domo, ' in Dumas' Queen*i Necklace, alone knows 
where there is but just one botile of a priceless 
wine left in the cellar of a distant chateau, and 
manages to steal it in time for a royal guest in so 
many hours and minutes by the clock. With ail 
his acquaintance with various dishes the author of

the Virginians missed it badly when in going over all 
he oould think of that the Colonists had to eat he 
quite forgot chicken safiid. Let us^see : 

•*Yoa know what I mean — shad and salmon and 
rockfish and ropdeer and hogs and buff^Ios and 
bisons. * * Count less quantities of shad 
and salmon, wild geese, wild swans, pigeons and 
ploYerSy and myraids of canvas-backed duckp. * 
* The gumbo was perfection, the shad were 
rich and fresh — stewed terrapins — sweets and flans 
— Mr. Justice, you love woodcook pie? ♦ • 
And now the sweets and pudding are come, of 
which I can give you a list if jou like; but what 
young lady cares for the puddings of to-day, much 
more for those which were eaten a hundred years 
ago?" 

It is of no use looking. There are some grand 
Virginian feasts but Hamlet is left out. There is 
cold roast *.urkey, but no Virginian chicken or turkey 



It is pretty certain if Madam Esmond, who had 
<*such a hand for light pastry," made chicken salad 
in Virginia a hundred years ago, the chicken was 
first but in bits about an inch long, and then pulled 
apart in shreds, for that is the way American house- 
wives of to-day say it should be done ; but then 
that lady had plenty of help. There is no 
slower operation than pulling chicken meat into 
fine shreds, and hotel cooks can'r.

Fowls to be cooked should always be sorted, and 
generally be boiled separately— the old and the 
youQg — for while some will be done in less than an 
hour others take 4 or 5 hours. To find when they 
are tender lift from the boiliog liquor with a fork 
and pinch the fiesh of the drumstick. To know 
when they are young, before cooking, try the point 
of the breast bone. When fowls have done growing 
the entire breast l>one hardens, before that it can be 
bent. A more reliable testis, try if you can push 
your thumb through the thin skin that stretches be- 
tween the joint of the wiogs. It is quite essential to 
make the matter of age sure before boiling a boned 
fowl done up in cloth.

Ohioken Salad. 



Boil 8 or 4 fowls in the stock boiler and when 
done tender set them away to get cold. 

1. Cut all the meat of the fowls into strips, and 
then across, making dice shapes, and as small as 
time will allow, but don't chop it. 

Cut 6 or 8 heads of celery the same way. 

Prepare either the mayonaise or the salad dressing 
made with cooked yolks. 

Mix with both the chicken and the celery, but 
seperately, a lir tie eil, vinegar, pepper and salt — 
just enough to moisten and make them look juicy — 



then press the chicken into an oval mould such as a 
melon mould or common jelly mould or a deep dish. 
The oil, etc., wi'l cause it to preserve a good shape. 
Turn it out on to a flat meat di*h. Spread the thick 
mayonaise all ov^r and smooth it with a knife, and 
place the seasoned celery around with a spoon. 
Decorate the salad with whatever may be con- 
venient, not always alike. A rose cut out of a beet, 
or a row of them, with parsley or other green, 
natural flowers, capers, sliced hard-boiled eggs and 
so forth, or chopped red cabbage sparingly sprinkled 
over, or cut lemons. 

Individual dishes just the same as above, but 
shaped in individual moulds, or in egg cups can 
have a cherry scooped out of a co( ked beet on top, 
or a green pickle — ways that are short and speedy, 
and olives either plain or stoned and stuffed come in 
good place. 

2. It is not essential to have a salad dressing for 
the above, but does well enough to add more oil and 
vinegar to the chicken and mince the celery fine. 
Celery so minced and mixed with oil and vinegar 
haa a buttery appearance and will keep shape 
when moulded, as it may be to form a border. Gar- 
nish with sliced or quartered eggs beside. 

8. Cut the chicken small. Prepare one-third as 
much celery and a similar quantity of green lettuce. 
Mix all and pour over a thin mayonaise or other 
dressing in a bowl. Combine thoroughly, and dish 
up spoonflils piled a little ia flat dishes. 

Border of small lettuce leaves, shred lettuce or 
minced yolks of eggs. This should «not be pasty, 
as thick dressing would make it. 

151. 

Veal salad may be made like chicken. It is best 
to call it veal salad and make it as good as chicken 
if possible. 



V58. 



Turkey Salad. 



The same as chicken salad. In cutting up the 
meat it is best to leave out the thick fat skin. With 
chickens it makes no difference. 



V5B. Mayonaise of Ohioken. 



Bone 4 young but plump chickens. There need 
be no difficulty in this. First out down the back 
and then cut close to the bones. It makes no 
difference if you do out through the skin once in a 
while. Carve through the hip joints, inside, and 
take the leg bones out after those of the carcass. 
Wash the chickens in cold water» dry them, lay out 
on a table and dredge plentifully with pepper and 
salt. Then lay two together, the white meat of one 
on the dark meat of the other, double or roll them 
up looeety, tie round with twine and boil them in 
the stock boiler an hour.

THE AKEBICAN OOOK. 



When done take off the twine and Inythe chiovf-ns 
oat flat on two large platters, place other platters 
on top, set in a cold place and a weight on to press 
them to about an inch in thickness. 

When quite cold cut the edges of the pressed 
fowls square and diyide them in shapes all of one 
site. Oblongs and parallelograms are most in style, 
and they laid not straight in the dish but slantwise, 
leaTiog the ends of the dish for the garnish. Pre- 
pare some mayonaise of savory jeily by mixing 
thick mayonaise with a third as maoh aspic jelly 
and when about to set pour a coating over each 
piece of the chicken placed on large dishes for the 
purpoee. 

Prepare the small dishes — 26 or 80 of them — 
with a bed sometimes of chopped green salad 
material or white celery, at others with finely 
minced eggs. 

Mince also a spoonAil of piclled blood beets, the 
same of green pickles and mix them with a like 
quantity of Ininoed yolk of eggs, but only the 
minute before using, less the beets color them alL 

When the dressing on the chicken is perfectly 
cold and set take each piece en a fork in the end 
and lightly dip the upper side in the minced beets 
etc., on a plate, and place it on its dish. At each 
end place a slice of lemon. 

Jelly mixed with cream sauce in proportion to 
make it set cah be used in place of the mayonaise. 

Chickens cut up in joints, after boiling and cool- 
ing, and the pieces smoothly trimmed, can be 
dressed as above and for a Urge dish may be piled 
around a center of lettuce salad. 

T60. FlUets of Fowl in Aspio. 

This way of getting the fillets ready, if not quite 
the best, is easier for cTerybody to practice than 
taking them off raw and braising with wine and 
seasonings. 

Cut the breasts Arom 4 boiled fowls while hot, 
taking them off with a pointed knife close to the 
'bone, with care not to tear or let the under fillet 
separate from the large one. 

Dip these whole fillets in the stock they were 
boiled in, dredge with salt and white pepper and 
then press them between two dishes with a weight 
on top. When quite cold trim the fillets into pear 
shape, then with a sharp knife diyide them in slices 
the flat way. Lay the slices in dishes and cover 
with clear amber jelly. When that is set out out 
the fillets and jelly with a tin cutter bent lo the 
shape. Eitherlay them on little dishes prepared 
with a bed of chopped jelly of another color, or bor- 
der them with piping of chopped jelly forced 
through a fiinnel or comet made of writing paper, 
and lay a slice of lemon on top. 

The fact is if the most splendid feasts of fioiton 



have been left incomplete and spoiled for the waat 
of salads, it is because salads are un-Eoglish and 
the aurhors are rather unfbrtunate than to blame. 
There is a remark in A Ui»tory of Our Own Timu to 
the effect that England is goTemed by phrases, and 
no phrase more powerful than to say a thing is un- 
English. And it has to be remembered King 
Richard fought Ssladin in Palestine as King James 
fought tobacco in England, and his countrymen and 
their descendants have been languidly putting 
down salad in Tarious ways ever since. Among all 
the ineomplete banquets of English noTslista, the 
man who can make a mayonaise was never so badly 
needed as at one in the beginning of TU Cioitter 
and the JItarth, The feast is, alas, a column long 
and though quite a curiosity to oulinarians is too 
long to copy. It is Aladdin's caTcm garden, with 
fhiit of g<dd and silTcr — the Land of Cockaigne 
with roast pig crying, "eat me !"— the wine flowing 
▼alley of Rasselas — a Vitellius banquet — a feast of 
Penelope's suitors— and a Lallah Roohk's attend- 
ance all joined in one Flemish prince's fiMtivity. 
Fifteen many-colored soups and as many wines, 
ilsh in a doien forms. Patties of lobster and al- 
monds mixed, and of almonds and cream and an 
immense Tariety of **brouetp," < 'known to us as 
rissoles." A whole hog with hair and eyes too 
naturally imitated with burnt sugar, an ox stuffed 
ftill of all sorts of small animals and roasted whole. 
Twenty different tarts of fruits and herbs. Con- 
fectioneiy on a gigantic scale. Hippooraa and 
Greek and Corsican wines. But no salads I And 
would not twenty different kinds of aaladSy 
jardiniere, Italienne, a la Busse, and aspics have 
shone gorgeously amidst all that splendor? It 
might be contended that Flanders was not a salad- 
making country, but Webster's dictionary says that 
the word slaw is nothing but Flemish slaa, and that 
is only their wny of pronouncing French salade ; 
and that kohl is the German for cabbage and we call 
kohl cold, so that cold slaw is in reality cabbage

Hot Slaw. 



8 quarts of finely shred cabbage. 

1 pint of yinegar. 

}pint of water. 

8 or 10 raw yolks of eggs. 

1 pod of red pepper, minced. 

8 ounces of butter. 

1 tablespoonful of salt 

Put the cabbage in a bright sink of the steam 
chest, or, otherwise, in a bright saucepan placed in 
another of boiling water. Beat the yolks in the 
Tiaegar and water till well mixed then add them 
and the butter and salt and pepper to the cabbage. 
Siir and turn oyer the cabbage frequently till the 
sauce thickens and becomes like cream. It ought 
not to boil more than a minute. 



The foregoing dish stands alone. It is a class by 
itselfl It cannot go under the head of salads but 
must take a place among the yegetables. But it is 
a general fhyorite. There is a popular usage of 
calling all cooked green yegetables salads as well as 
garden sauce; and there is foreign authority, 
though not yery "hefiy," for styling all hot yegeta* 
bles that haye a yinegar dressing, like our stewed 
beets with sour butter sauce, en aalade* 

But these are not dictionary definitions. The line 
most be drawn somewhere. All salads are cold. 



Here is a place where greens are called salad. It 
is from BwtrUifa Hiitory of Virfftma, and quoted by 
Thoreau: 

«Tbe Jamestown weed or thorn-apple, being an 
early plant, was gathered yery young for a boiled 
salad, by some of the soldiers sent to Virginia to 
quell the rebellion of Bacon ; and some of them ate 
plentifully of it, the effect of which was a yery 
pleasant comedy, for they turned natural fools upon 
it* for seyeral days : one would blow up a feather in 
the air ; another would dart straws at it with much 
Airy ; and another wa^ sitting up in a corner like a 
monkey, grinning and making mouths at them; a 



The proper definitions diyide salads in two ( 
the artificial, elaborate, compounded and peculiar 
like those just passed along, and the spontaneous, 
natural and uniyersal, the dinner of herbs and 
peace, like these remaining. These salads come in 
fhyor about the time the people who can are packing 
their trunks and discussing the merits and demerits 
of the different summer resorts.

Lettuce Salad. 



1. Keep the lettuces, after washing and trim- 
ming, in ice water till near dinner time. Shake the 
water from them and giye them time to drain upside 
down. Dish the tender heart leayes only in shallow 
bowls, and sliced hard-boiled eggs on top. 

The lettuce though cold and fresh should be dry, 
except for pieces of ice strewn over in warm weather. 
These bowls are to be eet on the dinner tables. 

The freshest eggs may look bad when turned blue 
by too long boiling, but it is not certain that even 
long boiling will *o discolor them if they be plunged 
immediately in the coldest water. Between the 
cooks, the pantrymen, the head waiter and the 
second steward it happens that the eggs on lettnoe 
nearly always come out blue. 

Bnl eggs six minutes; pour off the hot water im- 
mediately and fill up with cold.

2. Cut lettuce in shreds like oold slaw, with a 
sharp knife, on a board kept for the purpose. Have 
some chopped eggs ready on a plate and a onpful of 
Tinegar seasoned with pepper and salt in a pitcher. 

Dish up only as called for, some lettuoe in a deep 
dish, the yinegar poured over, and eggs dredged on 
top. 

8. Gut the lettuoe first in shreds and then across, 
quite small. It will not do to chop it in a bowl as

and a plate of <he smallest heart leayes of lettuce at 
hand. Dish up as called for, the lettuce in the dish,

set in for garnish. 

One.of the things that helps to lower the estima- 
tion people haye of hotel tables is the way they haye 
in some houses, where they take an interest in 
nothing but calm stagnation, of making lettuoe 
salads hours before they are wanted and dishing 
them black-looking, wilted and wamu 

It ruins lettuce to let it lie in yinegar long. 



Vea. Lettuoe Sweet Salad. 

6 or 8 heads of lettuce. 
12 small spring onions.

2 sprigs of garden mint. 

Gut the leituce small ; slice in the white part of the 
onions with yery little of the green ; chop the mint. 
Mix all. Serye cold. 

Some people say lettuoe should neyer be washed 
as water spoils it, but be gathered fresh from the 
garden and broken into the salad bowL That will 
do for the lady of a house^ but will neyer do for ho- 
tel work. Here is a story some centuries old of a 
giant, that will tell why : 

<'The story requireih that we relate what hap- 
pened unto six pilgrims, who came from Sebastian 
near to Nantes ; end who for i^helter that night, be- 
ing afraid of the enemy, had hid themselyes in the 
garden upon the chicheliog pease, among the cab- 
bages and lettioes. Oargantua, findmg himself 
somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any 
lettioe to make him a sallad ; and hearing that there 
^ere the greatest and fidrest in the country (for 
they were as great as plum trees) he would' go 
thither himself, and brought thence in his hand 
what he thought good, and withal carried away the 
six pilgrims, who were in so great fear, they did not 
dare to speak nor cough. 

''Washing them, therefore, first at the fountain, 
the pilgrims said one to another softly, *What shall 
we do ? we are almost drowned here amongst these 
lettioes, shall we speak ? but if we speak he will 



kill us for spies!* As they were thus deliberating 
what to do, Oargantua put them with the lettioe in- 
to a platter of the house as large as the huge tun of 
the Gislertians, which done, with oil, yinegar and 
salt, be eat them up, to refresh himself a lit le before 
supper, and had already swallowed up fiye of the 
pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally hid 
under the lettioe, except his staff that appeared, and 
nothing else; which Grangousier seeing, said to 
Giirgantua, *l think tbat is the horn of a shell snail, 
do not eat it.* 'Why not ?' said Oargantua ; *they 
are good all this month,* which he no sooner said 
but drawing up the staff, and therewith taking up 
the pilgrim, he eat him yexy well, then drank a ter- 
rible drauglit of excellent white- wine, and expected 
supper to be brought up.*' 

Nowadays we call those pilgrims mssete. Moral : 
wash your iettuce well and look between the leayee ; 
likewise your curled endiye, or chicory.

Onions. 



Sliced onions in vinegar are as much in demand 
as anything else in some places, however little the 
green bunches may be paronized on the hotel tabie. 
There is a great differeuca between the large white 
Spanish ooion which is mild and i nocent, and the 
strong red-skinned sorts. All of them may be im- 
proved by steeping the slices ia ice-water and then 
drying between two clean towels before patting in 
vinegar or mixing with sliced tomatoes or cucum- 
bers. 



TT4. 



Beeta 



Are most acceptable sliced in vinegar and served 
cold. Cooked of oourse till tender, though we find 
French directions for pu'ting beets in jars of 



vinegar with carraway and coriander seeds, without 
saying whether cooked or raw. Beets are used in 
Poland, Hungary and thereabouts, fermented and 
in many other ways that would seem very outlandish 
and perhaps disgusting to Americans. 



T15. 



Tomatoes. 



1. Serve them ofienest plain sliced in shallow 
bowls on the table either for breakfast or dinner, 
with only broken ice laid on them. 

2.' Make a tomato salad by mixing in a small 
proportion of sliced cucumbers and onions and 
pouring over them vinegar, pepper and salt. Gar- 
nisli with leaves of heart lettuce. 

8. Slice tomatoes in individual deep dishes and 
pour a salad dressing over. 

4. Tomatoes are liked by many people with a 
dressing of sugar and vinegar, like the lettuce sweet 
salad. 



For there is a natural craving for something 
herbaceous, green, and sour, and if debarred from 
regular salads, from vinegar and sugar, people seek 
such substitutes as nature ftimishes.

776. Mook Mayonaise. 

A ink who knows n >thing bat the best may 
fare badlj sometimes if be go to a restaarant where 
he is ezpeoted to make the folio wiog and is unable 
to meet the requirement: 

Make ihe cooked paste precisely as if for cream 
puffd (No. 296) using butter. Perhaps half of that 
receipt will suffice. . Work in eggs the same way. 
Mr hen it is nearly soft enough begin and add a 
little oil and a linle Tinegar, then another whole 
egg, a little mustard, more oil and yinegar, and so 
on until it is like mayonaise. A large quantity can 
be made wi h but little expense for olive oil in that 
way. This mock sauce is used to spread oTor the 
top of a chicken or lobster salad in many restaur, 
ants that are called first class. 



The custom is growing in &Tor CTeiywhere and 
8 particularly preTalent now in Ban Francisco of set- 
tiog a midday .lunch instead of dinner and haying 
the dinner at 6 or 6 o'clock in the eyening. 

This lunch makes a demand for good work in cold 
dishes of all kinds, and gives encouragement for its 
display that is never experienced under the plan of 
three hot meals a day. Tl.'C various articles con- 
sidered in this category of salads and cold dishes 
have everyone of them a use for the midday cold 
meal, they can be set out to the utmost advantage, 
and become as important a part of the steward' h 
and cooi&'s resources as the entrees, roasts and gume 
for a hot dinner.

G-alantines. 



A galantine, strictiy, is any kind of meat with 
the bones taken out, bat that is not the common un- 
deistandiug ; and it is not strictly obliged to be a 
cold dish — that is accordiog to dictionary definitions 
of the word— bi:t yet the general understanding is 
that \( should be. In one of the royal menus re- 
cen ly passtd ia review through this column there 
is a dish of gilantines of quail wiih truffles amoDg 
the entrees, and, although one has no means of 
reaching a certainty on such a point, it is quit<) as 
likely it was a hot dish of bonelsas qu«ils as a cold 
one. The boned legs of fowls stuffed with a force- 
meat are termed galantiues by one of our authorities, 
cold, however. 

Whaever may have been the meaning a hundred 
years ago it would lojk very ridiculous now to call 
a rolled up filet of veal or a boned ribs of beef 
rolled up, a galantine, or a boned boar's head a 
galantine. The term is applied only to fowls of all 
kinds and birds. 

Another unwritten distinction I find is made by 
cooks — and I have met with a good many of all 
sixes, and who never knew the drift of my cross-* 
questioning, and that is to call a bcned fowl a boned 



fowl, and only call it a galantine when it is oma. 
mented. This is as it should be, for the word 
galantine ia from the same root as the French 
gaUantm,, gtkW^nt, *'a beau," "something pleasant to 
look upon," * a nobby fellow," as it is variously de- 
fined. 

Many good things on the bill of fkre are partly 
thrown away for want of a popular underatanding 
of the names, hence we think the space devoted to 
this question is not wasted, and now will try to ob- 
scirve the distinction between plain boned turkey 
and turkey galantine.

through the columns of a daily newspaper. It is 
not quite the same as depositing matters snugly be- 
tween book covers, never to be opened, never tj be 
seen, and no harm d jne. Perhaps it is my du y to 
bring the little power much multiplied to the rescue 
of the noble bird of Thaaksgiving, the American 
turkey, from the prevai ing mitusage which makes 
it under the name of boned turkey to serve but as 
a distended lion's hide to c iver the recreant meat of 
a ciif, and this without intent of palming off a sham, 
but timply because of wrong teaching. 

S me two or three years ago it lay in my way to 
remark in these columns that a boned fowl ehould 
be stuffed with another boned fowl, and I have 
since been told that some old parties were as much 
astonished thereat as were certain other old parties 
when Oliver Twist asked for more. Still the world 
moves. 

As for the consumer's part no words are needed 
to show him that when he asks for a plate of boned 
turkey he should not receive for it a mess of hashed 
veal in a thin-stretched turkey's skin. 

As for the landlord or employer, who is mofet like- 
ly to be looked npon as responsible for the perpetra- 
tion of a species of fraud too small even to kick 
about, he knows nothing whatever about it, acd miy 
even have wondered that his own plate of boned 
turkey should seem so far from turkey and so near 
Bologna sausage. The fault is with the regular 
cooks, and primarily wiih the European teachers of 
cookeiy from whom all our hotel a la*M are derived. 
Were this a trick of the trade (but indeed there are 
very few tricks in our trade) of advantage econom- 
ically or otherwise, silence might be golden in 
respect to it, but while our prolific Southern and 
Western States turn off ih>u1^7 cheaper daring n

large portion of the year than Tea!, it must be 
matter of surprise that bnt few of our people know 
what genuine boned turkey is, for the reaaon that 
the eooks will push the poultry aside and Cake 
trouble to use Teal instead al a oost about a third 
higher. This is Old-World routine. The cook does 
as he learned of an older oook and the older refers to 
the books which direct to stuff boned turkeys, and 
indeed almost CTerything of the kind with minced 
Teal. Probably ttiose teachers had good reasons of 
ezpedieocy. Turkey mny haTe been an expensiTC 
luxury and had to be eked out. Possibly they 
made genuine boned turkey for kings and such, and 
thought Te«l good enough for people. At any rate 
they had while Tea? that might pass for chicken. 
In any European city may be seen, or might haTe 
been before Mr. Bergh's time, butchered carta 
packed with dying calTee lying on their backs, their 
heads hanging oTor the edge, their throats half cut, 
dripping blood OTer the oobble stones, making 
white Teal. Our butchers are lees brutal and our 
Teal is less white. Some of our butchers are so 
tender-hearted they will seldom kill a calf at all 
till his horns are well grown in the second year of 
his age, and do what you will that sort of Teal al- 
ways reftises to look like chicken. We hsTc to 
change our ways with the changed times. Our 
people are all able and wiiling to pay for boned 
turkey and they want it, and not beef sausage. 

We will hsTC another way of stuffing a boned 
turkey besides the annexed, but this, to use the 
words of a delighted club member, just recently, 
'■takes the cheese'* — wbaicTer that may mean. The 
gentleman is a Britisher hsTiog millions in mines, 
(can't get 'em out), but, thanks to the error of 
French cookery he had ncTcr stuck his fork before 
into so unmistakably genuine a galantine as this.

Boned Turkey. 



2 turkeys. 

1 corned tongue, already cooked. 

1 pound of dry salt pork. 

8 hard-boiled eggs. 

1 oupftil of aspic jelly. 

Seasonings. 

Take a large and a small turkey unopened, singe 
and wash and then bone them, cutting first down 
the whole length of the back. When boned lay 
them skin downwards on the table and season with 
pepper and salt, or with spiced salt. Gut the cooked 
red tongue and the fkt unsmoked bacon into strips 
pencil size and lay them alieroating on the turkey 
meat, lengthwise of the fowl, cutting gashes in the 
thickest parts to receiTC them CTcnly. Gut the 
yolks of the eggs in quarters and dispose them 
CTcnly among the strips, then chop the jelly and 
strew it OTcr. 



Yuu are now able to supply to the hotel patrons 
that long felt want, a turkey all breast. 

Boll, or rather double up carefully the smaller 
turkey and place it inside the other, remembering 
to turn it so that there will be f^und when the 
galantine is cut a breast at each end. Bring the 
two edges of the outside turkey together and sew it 
up with cotton twine and a large needle. Butter a 
cloth and roll the galantine up in it tightly and 
with a good many wraps, and either tie or sew it se- 
curely. Boil in soup stock with the tnrkey bones 
added. 



TVO« Boninff a Turkey. 

Some wonders ncTcr do cease. The same con- 
jurer's trick of the speaking head which GerTantes 
says so deeply impressed poor Don Quixote still 
astonishes and mystifies some portion of the public 
at the wixard'H show, and our wicked bu'chers still 
find some customers can be set strangely pondering 
when they are told that hotel cooks can take all the 
bones out of a turkey without cTer cutting the skin, 
as if it were a feat like drawing a large iron ring 
through the neck of a TiaL There was no difficulty 
in making the egg stand on end when Oolumbus 
bad damaged the shell a little, and you can get at 
the inwardness of a turkey quite easily after laying 
the skin of the back open. Gat close to the bone 
with a sharp-pointed knife till the hip joints and 
wingjoiots are reached and cut partially around, 
then with the he%Ty handle end of acarTing knifb ohop 
through those joints, and going a little ftiriher, 
loosening all along, the whole backbone portion can 
presently be pulled out forcibly, lesTing the limbs 
and breast to be boned separately. The wings and 
drumsticks haTc only to be boned part way, as the 
meat is tucked into the body ; the rest may be 
chopped oflT. While of course neat work is better 
than sloTcnly it does not quite spoil the job if the 
skin does get an unkind cut sometimes ; the Tory 
top of the breast bone is the place requiring the 
most care ; better cut into the bone a little than 
risk a perforation where it will show so plainly on 
the galantine. 

As the turkey is to be pressed in the cloth after 
cooking there should be no bulging ends or seams in 
the way to leaTC their mark.

They haTe a nioe letter press in the office and 
there ifl a clothes press in the housekeeper's room 
and another in the laundry, and a cider press in the 
milk house, that is only used once a year, but I 
don't think you have in the kitol:en a press at all for 
galantines or pressed beef or pigs' heads or head 
cheese, a press with assorted moulds and shapes and 
a metal tray to catch the overflow. 

Let the boned turkey when done remain in the 
liquor it was boiled in till cool enough to be handled, 
then place it between two large platters with a fifty 
pound stooe or sack of flour on the top. 

But if it is to be incused in jelly and decorated 
press it into a deep mould or pan of some sort. 

The long and narrow sinks of the steam chest, 
with their flaring sides, are suitable and make a 
handsome galantine, but common pans may answer 
if yon haye not special moulds. It is only the poor 
workman that finds &ult with his tools. Many of 
the pretty but useless articles of the French menu 
may be as well dispensed with but boned turkey is 
(to be) an American national dish, more than the 
huDiing beef or spiced round to the Old Eog.ish 
fquire, or than the boar's head to the S^ixon thane 
or Norman earl ; substantial, always welcome and 
when good highly appreciated, and therefore worthy 
of effort.

Boned Turkey in Asplo Jelly. 

Warm the mould or shape and take oat the 
pressed turkey. Remove the cloth, draw out the 
thread, wipe off all adhering jelly and ttX with a 
towel dipped in hot water aod shave off any dis- 
colored or ragged portions. With a vegeuble cutter 
stamp out half a dosen small shapes from a th ck 
sliced green pickle and place them on the boltom of 
the same mould, well washed and dried, that the 
turkey was pressed ia, and place the turkey restiog 
on them. This leaves a space under and around for 
a coating of aspic jelly to be poured in, and when 
quite cold and set the boned turkey can be turned 
out again on to its dish, thinly but evenly encased 
in dear jelly, which may be sliced and served with 
it. 



V89. 

To be used only to slice as cold meat the turkey 
need only have two or three coats of fresh butter 
melted and applied with a brush, the turkey being 
very cold. Ornaments of jelly, or of chopped jelly 
forced through a tube can still be added if desired in 
the individual dishes. 



Tour boned turk^, whether incased in jelly or 
not, will have a handsomer appearance to the con- 
sumers inside than outside, and when sent to table 
whole should always on some excuse or other be cut 



first, tbe halves or even the quarters of a turkey 
that is about all white meat can be edged and 
finished with decorations to look as well and in- 
finitely more appetising than any over-done "belle- 
vue" that is ever exhibited. 



We have spoken of the trifling divergence of oom«> 
mon usage from the strict definition of galantine, 
and have now to notice the same in regard to the 
description a la belUvue or m belUfme, It is ordi- 
narily understood by cooks and bill of fiare writers 
to mean that the article is incased in jelly and oma> 
mented. But it is applied by old authorities to sev- 
eral other sorts of decoration besides aspic jelly, 
even to hot dishes. The word means literally a pret- 
ty eight. The modem usage is to drop b4Ueou$ 
altogether and jnst say the galantine is decorated 
{deeorte.) 



When well done a something en bellevue is an* 
questionably a very handsome object ; the complaint 
is that a party may go to a ball supper and go away 
from it hungry for all the good a turkey done that 
WHy will do in the way of something to eat. It 
looks too pretty to cut — the jelly casing, not the 
turkey, ^bich indeed is not even seen — and besides 
is not suggestive of anything to eat at all. These 
things might better be made of cabinet work trans* 
parent glue and varnish and save the cook his 
wasted pains.

Pyramid of Boned Fowls, Decorated. 

Get the tinner to make three galantine moulds of 
differeut sizes flaring or taperiag so that piled on 
each other upside down they will form a pyramid. 
The largest may hold six quarts, the next four, the 
smallest two quarts. 

The long and narrow shape almost like a brick, 
with the edges sharp looks as well as any, though 
they may be six or eight^ided if preftrred. Pre- 
pare three boned and pressed fowls to correspond 
with the moulds, leaving plenty of room fbr the 
jelly. 

Prepare six quarts of aspic jelly clarified a second 
time and very firm. 

Prepare a large sheet of yellow custard made of 
sixteen yolks of eggs mixed with over half a cupfiil 
of clear broth and steamed in a six-quart milk pan 
set over a boiler— the pan to be buttered before the 
custard is poured in, but very slightly. 

Also prepare a similar sheet of white costard 
made of the whites of the eggs in the same way. 

These custards when cold are to be loosened 
round the edges and shaken out onto a slab, to be 
stamped out in fancy shapes, spear heads, leaves, 
stars, creecents, etc

To mix with these there may be also faooy shapes 
ent from slices of raw beets, carrot r and turnips, or 
some kinds of pickles, such as mangoes and large 
peppers, all well freed from moisture. The patterns 
ha^e to be graded in siye to oorrespond with the 
diffBrent siied moulds 

Set each mould in a pan of broken ice, water and 
salt. Pour in some melted jelly and on the jelly as 
it coats the sides onstruct the pattern desired, and 
when well set pour over another coat of jelly to se- 
cure it in its place. Finish perfectly CTen with the 
tops of the moulds with a bold pattern of spades or 
spear heads in close order, cut from some firm mate- 
rial, to add strength to the foundation edge. 

When the decoration is completed and well set 
place the boned fowls inside and fill the moulds 
around them with clear jelly so nearly cold as not to 
endanger melting the patterns from the sides. 

Obaerre that the boned fowls must be cut deep 
enough to rest on the bottom of the mould and 
reach quite CTen with the top, as the jelly will not 
bear any pressure and the blocks of meat must rest 
upon each other when built up. 

After building up these decorated galantines on a 
dish on a raised stand (sur socle) ornament with 
blocks and mouldings of aspic jelly, and, perhaps, 
if they be not regarded out of fashion, with orna- 
mental silTer skewers passed through wreaths of 
wax flowers.

Gktlantine Stufflng— Another Way. 

There is, to say the least, nothing better or more 
■atislkotory of its kind than this. For one medium 
turkey— anough sliced for 26 plates — make 8 pounds 
of forcemeat of another turkey or of chicken as foU 
lows: 



2 full-grown fowls boiled tender. 

6 ounces of fat talt pork. 

6 ounces of butter. 

6 ounces of white bread crumba. 

2 raw eggs. 

8 hard-boiled eggs. 

} pint of broth or stock. 

1 lemon. 

Salt and pepper. 

Tbke the dark meat of the fowls, ent it In very 
small dice and keep it separate. Take off the white 
meat, chop fine and then pound it to a sort of paste. 
Throw in the fat pork minced, the teaspoonfUl of 
pepper and salt and the bread crumbs and mix to- 
gether, and soften the butter and stir in. Mix the 
two raw eggs with the cup of broth and add the 
juice of the lemon, and with this mixture moisten 
the forcemeat. It is now ready for use. 

Lay the boned turkey ont flat and partly slice 
some of the meat from the thick parts and lap them 
over the thin, that the galantine may make even- 
appearing slioes and not seem in some parts all 
stuffing. Season with a teaspoonfhl of aromatic or 
spiced salt, if you keep that preparation on hand, 
otherwise dredge with pepper and salt ; then strew 
over the turkey about half the dark meat mince, and 
over that spread half the white forcemeat. Take 
the yolks of the hard-boiled tggs, cut them in 
quarters and scatter some over the forcemeat, then 
the rest of the minced dark meat, then the remain- 
ing forcemeat and egg yolks. 

Bring up the two edges of the boned turk^ over 
this stuffing and sew it securely. Then wrap, boil 
3 hours, and press it as already detailed for galan- 
tines. 

If you use truffles or f^esh grown mushrooms (not 
canned) they come in place in the white chicken 
forcemeat above instead of the egg yolks. The 
whites of the eggs look very well in all these galan- 
tines and may sometimes be added for variation.

Coat the sides of any sort of handsome mould— a 
fluted cake mould or jelly mould is as good as any — 
with clear jelly, according to the extended direc- 
tions for a pyramid already given ; line it with 
handsome slioes of turkey or chicken galantine, one 
slice slightly overlapping the other ; in the center 
drop a piece of the galantine not sliced, or a boned 
bird, fill up with Jelly, and when perfectly cold and 
set turn it ont onto its dish and decorate for the

flavors, which after all may not be appreciated as 
well as the natural flavor of the fowl, yet where

It is nothing, or next to nothing, to make aMlode 
a la Ruste or Museoyite or to put up a ffolantine de 
perdnauz a la royaU, Suppose not many can, not 
many want them and it comes out even. Bat there 
are some things that all hotel and eating-house 
keepers must do or haye done right that are quite 
difficult— getting the management of that heayiest 
item, the butcher meats, down to a fine point, for 
instance. The trying time of the man of the **back 
part of the house" does not come of the fine dishes, 
the uncommon things, the firash delicacies which 
money will procure in the markets ; the grand 
difficulty which so few can steadily fhoe and oyer- 
come is made up of a lot of small ones too ridiculous 
almost to specify — the difficulty of getting the coffee 
made always alike and sent in always hot and yet 
not spoiled by boiling ; of making somebody attend 
to their duty of keeping warm oups and plates; of 
getting cooks to make delicate fHed mush and con- 
scientious oatmeal porridge and deaiUooking firesh 
fried potatoes. 

We try to keep to a rule in these writings of not nn« 
derrating or passing by as useless anything that we 
haye not tried, sifted, proyed, weighed and 
measured and arriyed at the worth of, and in that 
way earn the right to repeat again and again, there 
are needed fifty thousand cooks (or call them what 
you will) who will take interest enough to make the 
common unconsidered (rifles well, for eyery one 
that is wanted to make ^iecM numUei and monstrosi- 
ties in wax and tallow. 

The sort of cooks to oultiyate, wUb are always 
wanted and for whom a little more wsges than the 
ordinary is no objection with hotel-keepers are those 
who will fry eggs clean, white and appetising, not 
black and smoked at the edges ; who can make 
batter-oakes as good without eggs as the common 
run can with half a dollar's worth mixed in ; who 
can make common rolls so good they can not be 
surpassed and take pride enough to rise half an 
hour earlier to do so; oooks who will bake pies well 



done on the bottom. And what profit is it to the 
hotel-keeper to haye in the larder 9kJambon a la 
gdu a la I^aneaiMe, which the guests may or may 
not reoognise and may or may not be afraid to oall 
for, if the corned beef is put on to cook only an 
hour or two befbre dishing-up time, is tough and 
ngected for dinner, sliced, rcsjeoted and thrown 
away after supper ? 

These minor obstacles to a perfbot table are neyez 
quite oyercome, but when I hear a hotel unoom • 
mooly well spoken of in this respect I am certain 
that a large measure of success has been attained, 
and I wonder then if there is not some one in the 
back part of that house looking thia-lhoed and 
tired? 

792. Oomed Beef Brine. 



6 gallons of water (about 8 pidlftilfl.) 

6 or 8 ounces of saltpetre— the large oiryatalfl kind* 

1 pint of molasses or sugar. 
' 10 pounds of salt. 

Set the water on the range in a boiler with the 
saltpetre in it to dissoWe first, because sometimee 
when the brine is so strong with salt as I o be what 
is called a saturated solution the saltpetre cannot 
melt in it but remains inoperatiye at the bottom. 
Then put in the molasses and the salt, let come to a 
boil and skim it. Pour into a clean ten-gallon keg. 

Two kegs of such brine are neoess^ry to haye for 
beef alone. It will keep good one or two months 
aooording to weather, but depending on how it is 
used. One is for dropping the course pieces of beef 
in firom day to day as they are culled l^m the - 
roasts and loios, the other is to change them oyer to 
when half oomed and touseoutofl But tongues 
and pork if pickled in the same kegs with the beef 
will spoil the brine yeiy quickly. There ought to 
be other and snmller yeesels of brine to reoeiye

Corned beef is an American <«stand-by," a per- 
manent fkyorite, and too much care can not be taken 
to haye it good. People tire of fish, of poultry, 
game and ham, but not of roast beef nor oomed 
beef, but wheneyer the hotel has to sell off its 
corned beef to get rid of it at a nominal price and 
buy the canned oomed beef of the packing housa 
because it is better it is tolerably certain there is a 
screw loose, and somebody is remiss in their duty oi 
lacking in skill and attention. 

The packing house oomed beef is good because it 
is made with good brine like that of the foregoing 
receipt, and because it is cooked almost to the sofU 
ness of jelly. It is too soft howeyer to be used hot 
It generally has just the right pink oolor, neither too 
red like raw meat nor too eolorless like boiled fresh 
beef, to make it look attraotiye on the table; this

long loins take out the bones— you need them in the 
stock-boiler — and roll up the boneless meat to about 
the siie of a wrist in diameter and of any convenient 
lengths, and bind these rolls tightly with cotton 
twine. They are generally finely streaked with 
lean and fix and when corned right color will slice 
cold into the very handsomest dishes of cold meat 
that can be set on a table, and are equally good in 
their way for hot corned beef on cabbage. 

If time allows it is best to shave the thick outer 
skin f^om such pieces of beef before rolling. Some 
lean and tough pieces such as come from the outside 
cut of the round, ftx>m the shoulder aod necE can 
be cut in thick steaks, quite large, thin steaks of 
ftt firom some other part laid on and both rolled up 
together, these as well as fragmenUry pieces are 
best used in the form of pressed corned beef. Throw 
the pieces when prepared into the brine, place a 
barrel head or board on top and a large stone to 
keep the beef under. Cover the keg with a cloth to 
keep flies oat and keep in a cold place. 

Hundreds and thousands of pounds of meat are 
epoiled in hotels and thrown away for want of de- 
cision in those who have to manage it, or, perhaps, 
for want of definite knowledge of what use each 
particular portion must be put to sooner or later. 
The choicest dose-trimmed joints of meat that can 
be purchased have some portion that is tough and 
hardly eatable with the ordinary five-minutes 
cooking, but even the worst can be made tender if 
cooked long enough in some suitable way — henoe 
the use of more ways than one in cookery, braising, 
stewing, potting, smothering, etc. 

It is the expedient of ignorance and inefficiency 
to get the rough aod tough off their hands by send- 
ing it to table as roast or steak, (we are speaking of 
good hotel tables, .of course), it is gone, to be sure, 
but will mostly be wasted just the same and some- 
body dissatisfied will eat something else. It is 
useless to hang a poor piece of beef on a hook «for 
the present" hoping in some indistinct way that 
something will turn up so that you will want just 
such a piece of meat as that. The meat you hesitate 
about in warm weather is losL It is the cook's 
business to know exactly what use every ounce can 
be put to. 



The minnis the meat cmnes ftt>m the batcher's, if 
possible, the portions that must be either salted or 
thrown away sooner or later should be taken off and 
put in the brine band, and if that can be kept in 
the ice house there need not be a pound leet even in 
the hottest season 

795. Boilinff Oornad Beef. 

Make it a rale of the day's work, whidi very 
soon wUl become a habit, to set on the salt meat 
boiler the first thing in the morning — say, at 6 
o'clock — and put in the corned beef at once. Fresh 
meats with all their juices in them should be 
dropped into boiling water, which immediately 
cooking the outdde prevents them from oosiog out 
into the water, but it is diflbrent with salt meats ; 
they have had iheir moisture withdrawn by the brine 
and are comparatively dry and should be dropped 
into cold water in the boiler. It is supposed the 
salt in them draws in the water till it reaohes cook- 
ing heat aod closes the outside. Corned beef treat- 
ed so cuts moist and fiiU of juices. 

Make it a rule that corned beef shall boil 5 honr^ 
Any late pieces or top pieces not thoroughly cooked 
should be allowed to continue boiling during din- 
ner, for corned beef reoooked next day to make it 
tenderer is never worth much — blocks washed out 
and is flavorless. 

19«. 

Of all the beef bought for hotd tables only a 
tbiid of the original weight arrives at the point of 
readiness to place on the gueat's plate ; only a 
fourth of the original weight actually reaches the 
table; probably onty half of that, oronedighthofthe 
raw weight is actually eaten ; so that for one hun- 
dred pounds of beef that really becomes sustenance 
to the hotel boarder eight hundred pounds of raw 
beef must be purchased. 

One-third of the raw wdght is bone ; one-third 
more is flat, skin, gristle, suet, disoolorations, blood 
stains, roughness and some scraps wasted in cutting ; 
the remaining one-third is dear meat in steaks and 
trimmed roasts. 

This one-third of dear meat loses at least a 
quarter of its weight in cooking, and if fat will lose 
a third, or even half. Of roast beef on the carving 
stand, after all these preceding losses, there U lost 
probably a fourth of the weight it has on leaving 
the fire. This weight is lost through bad carving, 
neglecting to clean the bones, gouging out choicer 
cuts for pet people and wasting much more, and 
through the flow of gravy and drying out by the 
heat, and finally by what is left over of the roasts 
not large enough or good enough to be used again.

weight will onlj tam out 1 10 pound galftotine alter 
oooking. 

If the beef ooets only 8 oentB per pound by the 
entire ourcaes, that whioh the hotel-keepers buy and 
the waiters oarry in to the guests on the indlTidual 
dishes will have oost in the neighborhood of 75 oents 
per pound, and what is aotually eaten by the guest 
will haye oost somebody about a dollar a pound, 
for some is left on the dishes entire and muoh more 
pulled about on the plates, oulled over, haoked and 
left. It is true there is one o£Bwt to all this — how- 
ever muoh more a hungry laboring man with only 
one dish might eat, the amount of any one kind of 
meat oonsumed by hotel boarders does not in an 
aTersge way exoeed two ounoes for eaeh person. 
But the proportion of waste is only the more enor- 
mous for that fact. 



It would require a Tolume to disonss the matters 
just speoified in all their bearings, but whosever 
business it may be it is not ours; we have enough 
to do with our oooking. It is amongjthe purposes 
and expedients of high intelligent oookery to lessen 
some of the great wastes of the raw material and 
lead people away firom olamoring for the Tory oon- 
densed essenoe of all that is dear and train their 
taste to the appreoiation of made dishes that are 
more the produots of skill than of oost, to the end 
that the prioe of living may be cheapened, and two 
persons may live well where one would starve at 
the present rate of reckless prodigality. It is ac- 
eepted as a truth, while nobody understands, that 
French oookery is essentially economical, and yet 
those who think they try it never find it so, but 
quite the contrary. It is those who are supposed 
to practice it) that are the wasters. 

The art and science is as high and worthy as 'any 
other, but the supposed followers are degenerate 
and unworthy. 

Qood cookery— call it French or what you will — 
consists, for example, in taking the bones that 
constitute one*third of the weight of the beef as the 
hotel man buys it, and extracting all they will 
yield by boiHng to make rich soups, and not only 
soups but stock to use in place of water to make a 
hundred common articles savory and nutritious, 
and in cooking the so-called rough pieces so well 
that they will be in greater demand than even the 
"choice cuts" of beef. 



797, Pressed Ck>med Beef. 



There is some advantage in merely pressing the 
large pieces after boiling, as it makes them firmer 
to slice, and some never go any further. The 
fltreaked rolls may be laid side by side and pressed 
to square or oval form. But pressed corned beef is 
generally expected to be something different from 
that. 



After boiling the beef 5 hours take it from the 
liquor, cut in pieces about as large as eggs and sim- 
mer it about 2 hours more, using for this second 
boiling some fresh soup stook or ohioken broth, Just 
enough to fairly cover it, and rich enough to bejel^ 
when cold. Season with a little pepper. 

Turn it out into the pan, tin pail or mould it is te 
be pressed in, the liquor with it, push a strainer 
down into it and take off the fkt that rises in the 
strainer. Place a plate or lid and a weight on td^ 
and set in a cold place. 

It is not best to drain pressed corned beef of the 
jelly completely. In making the finest and costliest 
paUs de eailUi, or of foist grot with truffles, trouble 
is taken when the baking is about finished t > in- 
troduce aspic jelly through an aperture left in the 
top for the purpose and pressed beef need not be 
made dryer and harder because it is a cheaper ar- 
ticle. Let the jelly be firm enough not to become 
soft on the table. 

798. Pressed Beef in Asplo Jelly. 

1. Cut the handsomest streaked rolls of cooked 
corned beef in slices, lay them on large platters, 
pour over enough clear melted aspic jelly to cover* 
When cold and set out out the slices of beef and 
jelly with a tin cutter, place on the dish they are 
to be served in and garnish with parsley, pickles 
and beets. 

2. Cut the cooked corned beef into dice quite 
small, simmer^for an,hour or two more in broth or 
stock strong enough to become jelly when cold. 
Then dip the meat into bright gem pans of some or- 
namental shape, in which you have first strewn 
some leaves of parsley. Set away to get cold, 
without pressure. When set firm take these in- 
dividual pamt de bauf from the moulds. Put at the 
bottom of each mould a slice of a piokle stamped in 
star shape and then return the cakes of beef to their 
places. Pour jelly in the thin space between the 
meat and the mould. Dish bottom side up and 
decorate. 

•*Cut and come again," it seems, has always been 
the motto of the English and Irish hunting squires 
when setting their boiled rounds of beef on the table 
— a free lunch for eyerybody. 

199. Oold Boiled Bound of Beef. 



Corn a whole round of beef in the corned beef 
brine, letting it remain from 10 to 14 days. Wash 
it, take out the bone from the center Out s'^me 
strips of unsinoked fat baoon as thick as a little 
finger and lard the beef with them, maiiog incisions 
with a oarviog knife aod drawing in the strips with

It is just necessary to mention that the larding 
with fat bacon is not essential, but is only an im- 
proTcment for the tough side of the round, and to 
the genera] appearance ; and that such beef rounds 
haye been boiled in home-brewed ale. 

800. Gk>ld Spioed Round of Beefl 

The same in general as the preceding but the meat 
tot pickled in a spiced brine. 

901. PioUe for Spiced Beef 

8 gallons of water. 

8 onnoee of saltpetre. 

8 pounds of salt. 

8 ounces of brown sugar. 

4 ounces of bruised black pepper corns. 

4 ounces of nuxed spices — allspice, doves and 



8 bay leaTCs. 

Tie the spices, pepper and bay leaTCs loosely in a 
cotton cloth and throw them into the ten-gallon keg. 
Make the brine as directed for corned beef and pour 
it hot upon the spices. 

The addition of half a head of garlic, or an ounce 
of coriander seeds, or one or two onions, or 
aromatic garden herbs can be made to the spiced 
pickle aboTO at option. Hotd cooking is the cos- 
mopolitan occupation and what may be offensiTe to 
one set of people often changes to the one thing 
most essential for another. The coriander seed ad- 
dition is, howcTor, generally acceptable. 



Spiced sheep's tongues, calyes' and pigs' feet and 
other oold meats can be pickled as well as beef in 
the spioed 'brioe— a method much surer, safer and 
better for the usual haste of hotel work than dry 
salting or pickling, whioh requires daily attention, 
turning and rubbing — and doesn't get it? 

801a. Oold Spiced Beef Rolls. 

Lay the solid lean pieces of the round of beef 
open in steaks, and on top of them lay thin sheets 
of fat salt pork. Boll up, tie, and keep in the spioed 
pickle two weeks. 



When to be cooked open the rolls, wash in cold 
water, spread over with parsley leaTCS plentifully, 
roll up again and tie. Place them in a saucepan 
and half fill with good soup stocE. Geyer to keep 
the steam in either with buttered paper and the lid 
or with a lid of flour-and-water paste and keep the 
rolls stewing about 5 hours. Cool in the same 
liquor ; press like corned beef; slice cold. 



By way of excuse for Arequeni qudations firom 
Sir Edward Bulwer Lyiton's first noTCl, Felham, we 
will kuaaer not moutofu long enough tc remark that 
the Lord Ouloseton of that noTcl is none other than 
Brillat-SaTarin, author of Otutranomy and Chutnm-' 
amen^ and almost the only writer of note on the 
subject, as the young and enthusiastie author 
imagined him after reading his book in the French. 
In his last novel, the Fariaiani, Lord Lytton re- 
turned to his earlj impresnons and introduced a 
character named Savarin 

"And thou most beautifhl of all, thouerening 
star of eiUremeU — thou that ddightest in truffles and 
gloriest in the dark cloud of sauces — exquisite /ote- 
^m/— Have I forgotten thee?. What though the 
goose, . of whioh thou art a part, has, indeed, been 
roasted by a dow fire, in order to increase thy di- 
vine proportions— yet has not our Almanach — the 
Almanach des Gourmands— truly declared that the 
goose rqoioed amid all her tortures — ^because of the 
glory that awaited her 7 0, exalted among birds— 
apotheosied goose, did not thy heart exult even 
when thy liver parched and swelled within thee, firom 
that most agoniiiog death ; and didst thou not, like 
the Indian at the stake, triumph in the very tor- 
ments whioh alone could render thee illustrious ?" 

—POkam. 

That settles it. We don't want any pretematur- 
ally enlarged fkt livers of geese if they have to be 
obtained in that way. 

In the countries where truffles grow and these ab- 
normal fU livers are produced the paUa or raised 
pies are made with about three livers partly split 
like pouches, and truffles out in pieces stufied into 
the cavities. The crust is of hot- water paste raised 
in a mould. The inside of the raised crust is first 
lined with a forcemeat made of chicken meat, bread 
crumbs, fat pork and herb seasonings, pounded and 
forced through a seive. The livers are laid in, 
truffles strewn in fragmeots over them, fat pork aod 
forcemeat over that and a top orust over alL The 
pie is baked over two hours, enveloped in buttered 
paper. When nearly done it is withdrawn from the 
oven and some cognac brandy poured in. It is re- 
turned to the oven, and when done is filled up with 
aspic jelly mixed with madeira wine. The pie is 
elaborately ornamented with patterns in paste, and 
the dish with jelly.

If you have no spioed salt add a bayleaf, pepper,

THE AMEBIOAN COOK 



«We have a fixed prioe for all oar proTisions. It 
sigoifies nothiog whether you eat much or little — 
whether you hare ten dishes or one— it is always 
the same prioe/' 

-^MofUe CkriaU>, 

<*Only ignoranoe can excuse those who senre up 
the quail otherwise than roasted or mpapiUote$f be- 
cause its flaTor is so easily lost that if the animal is 
plunged in any liquid it enkporates and disap- 
pears." 

8C3b. Gktlantines of Quails. 

First prepare the godioeau or forcemeat to fill out 
the thin parts of the quails: 

12 ounces of pork tenderloins. 

12 ouoees of cooked ohicken meat. 

20 ounces of fresh fot pork. 

Pound them smooth, the chicken first, the tender- 
loin added and then the fot Season with spiced 
salt and rub the paste through a seive. 

Then prepare these for filling, all out in small 
dice: 

1 cooked red corned tongue. 

1 pound of chicken livers — ^parboiled* 
12 ounces of cooked fat bacon. 
12 ouDces of cooked ham. 

2, 3, or 4 cans of truffles— or, some mushrooms. 

Salt, spices, madeira wine or sherry. 

Bacon slices to wrap the Urds in. 

Some meat glaze. 

Flour-and-water paste. 

When you have out the tongue, liTcrs, bacon fot, 
ham and tmffles in small dice season them either 
with spiced salt or with pepper and spices equiva- 
lent, and then stir in half a cup of wine. 
• Bone two doxen quails, wipe them dry and clean ; 
pare some meat from the breasts and lay it over the 
thin places; spread over them a little of the force- 
meat paste, over that a layer of the dice-cut mix- 
ture, and then fold up the quails to their original 
shape. losteadof sewing roll eich bird io a thin 
slice of unsmoked bacon or dry salt pork. These 
are now to be cooked separately and this is best 
done in deep muffin pans or gem pans of granite- 
ware — either round or oyal will do but they must 
be large enough to hold gravy above the quails, and 
in nests of ten or twelve fastened together the 
usual way. Press the galantines into the pans, 
pour over a little melted fresh butter mixed with 
meat glaze (natural meat gravy simmered down 
thick), cover each one with a crust of flour-aod- 
water paste, bake in a moderate oven about an hour, 
the gem pans or moulds set in a baking p^n con- 
taining boiling water. — They must not brown nor 
fty. 

When done take off the paste covers and let the 
quails cool a little, then press them by setting one 



nest cf pans or moulds on top of the other and 
weights on top of all. When quite cold take the 
galantines from the moulds, remove the covering of 
bacon, trim them and use in the ways of the larger 
galantines, either to slice in jelly, built in a pyramid 
and decorated, or to surround a larger galantine. 



The greatest care is required in seasoning the 
above lest they come out too salt, the ham, tongue 
and bacon all being likely to contribute some. The 
butter used should be poured off dear, and fresh 
pork may be used for outside wrapping instead of 
salt, rather than risk anything. 

Somewhere, I think, the Count of Monte Ghristo 
has a splendid cild supper set in a wonderful cave, 
and there is a large fowl, perhaps it was a turkey, 
surrounded by Corsican blackbirds Likely enough 
the heads of the blackbirds were set on again after 
the tiny galantines were cooked and ornamented. 
But it is not likely that the cook made a separate 
lot of fillings for the birds when he had just stuffed 
the turkey with another kind. He might haye had 
to do so had he been cooking for a houseful of 
boarders without appetites, to whom nothing tastes 
good, but he had to serve only transients, just ar- 
riTing and mostly delighted with all they meet with 
at the hotel table. The cook in that case used for 
the large galantine the same kind of forcemeat as 
that in our boned turkeys and chickens some dis- 
tance back, which is very good and not too arti- 
ficially flavored, and he took some of the same and 
added truffles cut small to it for the galantines of 
birds. When boning quails for a supper where 
there is no bill of fare to turn attention to them it is 
best to leave the legs on — ^bonedhalf way and stuffed 
•to show what they are. 

8<WcJ3oned Piff'a Head in Jelly. 

The head should be corned in the same kind of 
pickle as corned beef, but only lie in it 2 or 8 days. 

Bone the head before salting. It should be the 
head of a butcher's porker, not a flat bacon hog. 
Saw it in halves and cut the meat close to the bone. 
It is handier to slice made up in two halves than 
one whole head. You want besides! 

4 pounds of sausage meat ttom the buioher^s. 

2 corned red tongues, or 4 if pigs* tongues. 

2 pounds of fat salt pork. 

Take the two halves of the head from the brine, 
wash in cold water, trim off any discolored portions, 
take off the ears — ^they can be thrown in the boiler 
separate — ^then laying the head skin downwards 
slice off some of the meat from the thick parts and 
lay over the thin. Spread some sausage meat over ; 
cut the tongues and fat pork in strips and lay them 
on the sausage crosswise of the head. Cover the 
strips with the rest of ihe sausage meat. 

Boll up the two halves tightly, beginning with 
the snout, which is to be in the middle of the roll, 
and the rolls to be of even thickness from one end

Boil from 4 to 6 hours in a boiler that will hold six 
gallons of water, and put in with the head some 
sonp Tegetables and eage, and pepper and salt. 

When done press them in shape like any other 
galantine ; there is no better shape than tbe long 
and narrow sinks of the steam ohest. Some oheaper 
tins made like them should be kept on hand for suoh 
purposes. 

The liquor in whioh the head has boiled 5 hours 
will be a strong jelly when oold, without the addition 
of gelatine. 

The oloth wrapping for galantines and pig's heads 
that oomes the nearest to absolute purity is a pieoe

new oloth. It should be washed in olear water and 
kept white and dry for suoh uses. 

Take off the grease and olariQr the Jelly in the 
same way as directed for aspiOi and then use it to 
ooat the boned pigs' heads in their moulds by the 
same method as boned turkeys. 

They are adapted either to be set on the table

Split the heads, bone them, singe, scrape and

up the meat, strain the liquor through a fine gravy 
strainer, put cut meat and liquor back in the boiler 
and simmer 2 hours more with the seasonings added, 
cool and press in moulds or bright milk pans. 2

The next trifle was a wild boar, which emelled

it with two shrieks of dism ^y, and pinch so good a 
friend as Gerard ? Becau&e the duke's cuibinier 
had been too clever, had m»ide this excellent dish 
too captivating to tbe itight as well as taste. He 
had restored to the animal, by elaborate mimicry 
with burnt sugar and other edible c lors, the hair 
and bristles he had robbed him of by fire and water. 
To make him still m ire eatioing, the huge tusks 
were carefully preserved in tbe brute'a jaw, and 
gave to his mouth the winning smile that comes of

We have only to remark of the above ferocious 
monster that the tusks he showed were not his own, 
but were imitations made of tallow hardened with 
alum ; his mouth was made dreadful by being spread 
all over the inside with red butter colored either 
with beet juice or with lobster coral ; his savage grin 
was produced by propping up his lips, where the 
tusks protrude, while the head was warm after 
cooking, and letting it become very cold before 
taking the chips away, and his eyes were very 
likely of c^Uss marbles, or the proper made glass 
eyes used by taxidermists ; as for the bristles, tbe 
skin was first brushed over several times with meat 
glaie and when that was quite dry the confectioner 
came with some melted sugar taffy and a brush made 
of iron wires and made sugar hairs stand up all over 
it and then barbered them to the right heigbth.

809f: -Lothair. 

In the entire iist of foreign royal menus, some 
four score in number, preriously insanoed m these 
columns, only one has huUru aux citrotu, or raw 
oysters at all, and this is at the ducal palace of 
Hesse Darmatadt. in 1868, and the oysters preceded 
the meal. 

However, the Isshion cannot be very new, for 
they tell us the emperor Heliogabalus used to eat 
400 Bmndusium Blue Points every morning, to give 
himself an appetite for his breakfhst. 

According to a writer ia Leslu't Montklif, speak- 
ing for New York, the rule which declares oysters 
good only in the months spelled with 'y is but 
little regarded now, and the trade is becoming 
curiously systematized so that there is a difierent 
crop of oysters for difierent seasons and difierent 
purposes. The Prince's Bay's ru'e almost ex- 
clttsiTcIy in the summer months, succeeded by 
Sounds and Mill Ponds. The winter months br'ng 
the Bockaways and East Rivers, and the Blue 
Points, most esteemed, predomioate through the 
spring. There are long Saddle Rocks for roasts 
and broils; East Rivers and Virginias for slews, 
while for a raw dish the round, fat, large Blue 
Points and Shrewsburys are preferred. 



The effort at luxury now is to serve raw oysters 
in hollowed blocks of ice, and they might as well be 
in clear colored ices, sea gr«en and ocean blue, 
firosen in form with shells and pebbles — much 
easier to fireexe than sweet ices and motusea glae^u.

Cold Ham. 



It may be Just necessary to mention that hams te 
be roasted or baked are on rare occasions steeped 
in wine with spices and herbs, and are entirely 
covered with a flour-and-i»ater paste and so baked. 
They are also alter steeping (marinading) braised 
in covered iron saucepans, with seasoned soup stock 
and wine, and finished by baking brown. 

Put the ham in water slightly warm and let it 
soak all night. Wash and set it on in cold water 
and boil 8 to 4 hours. Take it up, remove the skin 
and bake it in a moderate oven half an hour. Then 
withdraw it, cover with all the cracker meal that 
can be made to stick with pressure, and bake a few 
minutes longer to brown the breading. Cracker 
meal is pounded and sifted crackers. Dried bread 
crumbs do as well, or raspings of bread. 

8a9h. To G-laze a Ham. 



Meat glaie may be defined as beef tea boiled 
down till it is as thick as syrup, and like gum when 
quite cold. It may be obtained in quantity by 
boiling down rich stock or stewed meat liquor. 

To glaze a ham, after baking it brown give it two 
or three coats with a brush dipped in glass, diying 
it in a warm place after each application. 

Another way, usefiil when there is no glaie ready, 
is, after baking the ham brown; cover it with all 
the granulated sugar that oaa be made to s ick to it 
with pressure of the hands. The ham shoild, 
however, be first freed as much as possible fkt>m 
grease by means of a dry doth. Put the sugar- 
coated ham back in the oven and watch it till the 
sugar has become caramel brown all over alike.

Sandwiches. 



1. Two thin slices of buttered bread and a slice 
of cold roast turkey, peppered and salted, laid be- 
tween. Cut the slices in square form, then across 
to make triangular sandwiches. Pile on a folded 
napkin. 

2. Melt a cupftil of butter in a saucepan. Mince 
an equal quantity of cold boiled ham and add it to 
the butter. Put in for seasoning a tablespoonful of 
made mustard, pepper and a chopped pickle. 
Spread one slice of bread with this mixture, another 
with plain butter and lay a very thin slice of cold 
roast veal between. 

8. Spread slices of cold ham with a little mus- 
tard and lay between two slices of buttered bread.

are preferable t'> sliced bread for sandwiches fbr

Ornamental Stands fbr Oold Diahee. 



Such artioles as white galantines, jardiniere salad 
and whole fishes ooTered with m^yonaise hsTO to 
be raised on tall stands* or tbey make no show at 
all on a set table, and an ornamental set-off is as 
valuable to a homely-looking dish as to some other 
homely things. A common glass oake stand can be 
so coated with while wax* or parrafio, and so 
ooYored with white wax flowers of a sort easily 
made, and artificial leaves, that it can nerer be 
recognised f r what it is, and a white galantine 
seems very much at home on that sort of stand. 
But the better expedient is to get a carpenter to 
make some stands of wood, something like glass 
cake stands* that is, consisting of a stem set in a 
broad oase, but of oval shapes, the top being a tray 
with a hoop-like rim to receiTC and hold the large 
meat platter. 

These cabinet-work stands being neatly made of 
white wood and smooth, are next to be coated oyer 
with parrafin melted and applied with a brush, 
then smoothed by holding before the fire. 

There are moulds to be had, imported from Paris, 
made of type metal and close fitting in which may 
be cast classical figures in white wax, sea-horses, 
dragons and the like to be set around the base of 
your stands, and beads and fiMses and birds for the 
ends of the platters. 

The making of the multitudinous roses is a very 



simple matter, and though they are not very life- 
like they answer the temporaxy purpose quite welL 
Tou take half a doien carrots of different siies and 
cut the ends as near as may be in the resemblanca 
of flowers, dip them in melted parrafin or wax and 
then immediately into cold water. The thin waxen 
mask of a fiower shape can then be polled off and 
another made. . These are of course easily set ^a 
clusters on the stands by means of melted matg #ad 
white leaves such as cakes are ornamented witliOQia* 
plete the garlands. But all sorts .f moulding; ogr* 
niees and borders can bO Ottd . on the oam. jgb^ 
Instead of wax these stands can be covered with 
cake icing, white or colored, and with ornaments of 
gum paste. 

One thing more : There is a little patcliing to be 
done in our trade as well as others. It is difficult 
to boil a fish so entire that it can be covered smooth- 
ly with a jelly and show no yawning chasms, and 
to have a boards head without an ugly twist in the 
comer of his mouth. To smooth over the breaks in 
the fish, or to stuff it In natural form make a paste 
of whitefish pounded with half as much bread, a little 
butter, and yolks of eggs, and bake the fish a little 
while, covered with buttered paper. For the other 
oase forcemeat will answer, glased over.

802 A;. Raised Pies. 

They are of two or more kinds, either raised by 
pressing a common paste into the shape of a dish, 
with the fingers, or made more ornamental with a 
richer paste in a tin mould. 

For the la'ter make the ordinary short paste the 
same as for covered pies or shortcake, of a pound 
of lard to two pounds cf flour and a little saU,mixed 
up pligbtly warm. Eoead it compact and smooth 

Put a buttered sheet of paper on a baking pan, 
butter the mould inside and set it on the paper; put 
in a bottom crust half an inch thick and then line 
the sides, wet-ing the lower edge and pressing it to 
join the bottom piece. 

The pie may be filled with anything in the meat 
line that is good to eat oold; there may be a boned 
chicken prepared exactly as directed for galantine, 
and some boned quails placed around it, and have 
truffles and 'mushrooms for seasonings and thin 
slices of fat unsmoked bacon en top. 

But to make it as fine as possible, the ioside of 
the crust should be spread over with liver pas e 
made as at No. 802, or preferably pezhaps, with fine 



sausage meat, before the fowls are put in. 

Then put on the top crust, pinch the edges, trim 
neatly, roll the scraps of paste thin and stamp out 
leaf shapes enough to cover the top. Leave a hole 
in the middle. Bru h over with egg and water, tie 
greased paper outside the same as in baking a ft*uit 
oake; bake the pie in a slack oven three or four- 
hours. Open the mould and take it off when the 
pie is nearly oold, and as no liquor is baked in the 
pie, some gravy made by boiling the bones of the 
fowl down rich enough to be jelly when cold, must 
be poured in the cavity left in the lid. 

The renowned Perigord pie has the inside lined 
wih slices of truffles set in liver paste seasoned with 
aromaiio salt, and the filling is of fat goose livers 
and truffles, bacon on top and aspic jelly mixed with 
Madeira wine poured in while the pie is cooling.

802 771. Ohioken or Turkey Sausage. 

Take the akin o£f a large fowl by first cutting 
down the back and cutting around the Joints to the 
akin as nearly whole as possible. 

Cut all the meat of the fowl fk^m the carcass with- 
out bone or gristle, chop it raw, like sausage meat, 
and then pound it with a maaher in the choppiog 
bowl. Weigh i^ and take half as much fat bacon, 
chop and pound it likewise. Mix the two pastes 
together, season like sausage-meat with pepper.sage 
and salt. Roll up in the skin of the fowl and then 
in a napkin, and boil the sausage in seasoned broih, 
with the bones of the fowl in it, for an hour. When 
done put it on a dish to cool in the napkin it was 
boiled in, and pnother dish or other weight on top 
to give it an even shape. Slice cold and ornament 
with lelly and p rsley. 



802 n. Truffled Obioken. 

1 fat pullet, and the breasts of 2 more. 

1 large can of truffles. 

} pound of fat salt pork. 

Seasonings. 
Bone the fowl according to directions at No. 779, 
and cut off the fiUe a or white meat of the other two 
and lay them all side by side on the table. Cut the 
fat pork in thin strips, score gashes in thick parts of 
the chic' en and lay the strips in, out the truffles and 
dispose the pieces evenly where they will show the 
b'aok spo's in the white meat when the chicken is 
sliced. Dredge well with salt and white pepper 
and a little nutmeg and powdered thyme. ' Then lay 
the chicken breasts in the thin places of the fowl, 
bring the two sides together and sew up the fowl 
into nearly its original shape. Do it up in a cloth, 
tie and pin it, and b il it two hours in salted broth. 
Press it while cooling. Take off the doth when 
cold, draw out the thread it is sewed with. Serve 
the fowl either incased in aspicjelly, or coated with 
melred butter, or slice it and display the slices in a 
dish. 



802 o. Sandwiches of Patted Quail. 
Make rolls, either split or rounded, but flat, and 



place inside a half of a potted quail, prepared ao- 
cording to the following receipt. 

802i>. Potted QualL 

1 dozen quail. 

1 pound of veal. 

1 pound of fat baoon. 

Seasonings and paste. 
Bone the birds as directed for boning fowls; a 
penknife may be used, and no great care is requir- 
ed, except to get all the meat and not tear the sides 
to tatters. Cut each in two. Chop the veal and 
baoon together into sausage meat, and season with 
a teaspoonful of mixed m<ice, cloves and white pep- 
per, and the same of salt, and a teaspoonful of finely 
miner d lemon rind. 

Select c jar or two small ones that the quail may 
be kept in after cooking, spread a thin layer of the 
veal and baoon forcemeat on the bottom, lay the 
halves ( f quail in order on- that, spread them with 
a little of the foroemeat and so on till all are in, hav- 
ing forcemeat for the top. Cover with a thin slice 
or two of bacon,, then with a crust of flour and water 
paste and bake by setting the jar in a pan of water 
in the oven, for three hours. 

^hen done take off the crust and drain away the 
fat and gravy and press by placing a small plate 
inside on the meat and a weight on that. When 
cold cover with clarified butter and cover tightly to 
exclude the air. 

In ca«e bacon is not liked in such pottings as the 
two preceding, fresh butter sufficient to cover and 
bake the meat or birds in can be used instead. 



802 ?. Potted Babbit. 

Potted meats will keep for months if required,and 
oan be drawn upon as the occasion requires. 

2 small rabbits or 1 large one. 

1 pound of fat bacon. 1 pound of veal. 

The liver of the rabbits. 

Salt, pepper and spices. 
Cut the rabbit in pieces and put it in a stone jar; 
cut the veal and baoon in large dice, mix them and 
add a teaspoonfhl of mixed mace, cloves and black 
pepper, and a tea<tpoonful of salt, and fill the spaces 
between the pieces of rabbit. Lay a thin slice or 
two of bacon on top and 1 bay leaf, then cover with 
a lid of p*ain paste made cf flour and water only, 
set the jar in a pan or pot containing water and 
bake in a slow oven 8 or 4 hours. There is no 
water needed in the meat. A greased paper on top 
will keep the paste from burning. 

When done,8et the jar away to become cold, pick 
the meat from the pieces of rabbit and pound them to 
a paste along with the veal, and baoon and fat, and if 
any gravy at the bottom boil down almost dry and mix 
it in. Taste for seasoning. Press solid into small Jan 
or cups,and cover the top with the dear part of 
melted butter. Keep tightly covered in a oool place.

them in, then the flour, and melt the butter and 
stir it in last Bake in shallow moulds, like, 
sponge cake, and in sheets to be cut in diamonds 
and iced over. * 

JELLY SLICES. 

Bake a sheet of Genolse cake, or any mixture 
you are used to that will bake level and not rise, 
rounded over in the middle, and have it less than I 
an inch thick when done. Turn it out of the pan, 



bottom side up, cut in long strips, split them and 
spread with red fruit jelly or jam same as jelly 
cake. Stir up a pearl glaze (No. a) and spread 
over the top of the strips of cake. This gla^ or 
icing can be made with water as well as with 
white of eggs, just enough to wet the powdered 
sugar so that it can be spread smoothly, and can 
be made pink by using fruit juice instead of 
water. When these large strips oi jelly cake have 
been iced over with it, cut them with a knife 
dipped in hot water, into long and narrow pieces 
and set them a little distance apart on pans for 
the Idng to dry. 

MERINGUE MARSES. 

Make jelly slices like the last but histead of 
plain sugar icing pile a thick covering of stiff 
meringue on top of the large strips, then with a 
knife dipped In hot water cut down through the 
meringue and cake and bring the knife straight 
up again, so as to divide the cake in narrow 
strips without displacing the meringue much. 
Smooth the sides and top of each piece, then bake 
in a slack oven to a light fawn color. The sheets 
of cake for this form need not be split, but jelly 
spread on the top and meringue on the jelly. 
The name " marse " is probably foreign. 



HINTS ABOUT MERINGUE PASTE. 

The whites of duck's eggs make the firmatt 
meringue. An ounce of sugar to an ounce of 
white of eggs is the rul \ The- whites should be 
beaten up quite firm at first — so that it will not 
slide about in the bowl and will stay in firm 
pieces wherever It is placed — and after that the 
sugar should be added in three or four portions 
and all beaten again. Too much heat in the oven 
will cause the meringue to shrivel and fall. 



MERINGUE SURPRISES. 

They are shallow pastry tarts containing hall a 
peach or apricot and built up high with meringue^ 
then, instead of being baked, are coated with hot 
fondant. The surprise consists in finding a fruit 
tart inside of what appears to be but a kiss me* 
ringue. Bake tarts In shallow patty pans. Cover 
with meringue by means of a bag and tube, lay- 
ing the meringue around the edge first and then 
another ring and another cone -shape until it ends 
in a tall point at the top. Run hot fondant all 
over it by means of a funnel with a handle, made 
for the purpose. When cold and dry remove the 
** surprises" with a knife from the marble slab on 
which the coating has been done, and the surplus 
drippings of sugar can be scraped up and Mved.

tion — color pink on one side with a brush dipped

of green vegetable coloring while melting. These

LfOndon confectioners. 



JELLY ROLL MIXTURB. 

I pound of sugar. 

14 eggs— or I or 2 less, if large. 

I pound of flour. 

}i cup lukewarm water. 

>^ teaspoonful of soda — smalL 

Lemon or vanilla flavor. 

Beat eggs and sugar together until light and 
thick and increased to three times the original 
bulk, gradually add the water while beating, with 
the soda dissolved in it Stir in the flour just 
long enough to put it well out of sight, as usual 
for sponge cake. 

Bake on manilla paper slightly buttered, and 
to get the roll of uniform thickness run the batter 
out of a lady-finger tube in lines on the paper al- 
most touching, that they may run together and 
make an even sheet of cake. 



SWISS ROLL. 

Having made the jelly-roll sheet as above, 
spread it with fruit jelly or jam, roll up, then brush 
•ver with sweetened water well flavored with 
lemon and roll it over in plenty of powdered 
sugar spread on a sheet of paper, then set it where 
the sugar coating will dry. 

VENICE ROLL. 

Roll up a sheet of cake spread with jelly or 
jam and ice it over with pink glaze or water icing 
(No. 2), made by wetting the icing sugar with 



red currant or cherry juice, or wine and coloring. 
Ornament the top and sides with a pattern in 
white egg-icing. 

PARIS ROLL. 

When the jelly roll is made, spread red currant 
jelly thinly all over the outside, then roll itift 
grated or desiccated cocoanut, enough to c«at it 
over. Some powdered sugar should be mixed 
with the cocoanut and then, if the roll be allowed 
to dry off, it yrill not be so liable to be sticky as 
the jelly and cocdanut alone will make it. 

CHOCOLATE ROLL. 

Make a jelly roll and cover the outside with 
chocolate icing (recipes for making different sorts 
may be found in the index), and then pipe on a 
wreath pattern in white egg-icing. 



JELLY ROLL COTELETTES. 

Make a jelly roll and with the rolling-pin roll 
down one side rather flat so that the slices, when 
cut, will have the shape of the meat part of a 
nicely trimmed mutton chop; the cake repre- 
sents the fat and the jelly the streaks of lean. To 
make the imitation better, ice the chops over 
with transparent glaze or water icing. When 
dry, build them in cake basket or dish in pyramid 
form. 

DECORATED JELLY ROLLS. 

Jelly rolls to serve whole on a set table may be 
covered with water icing or pearl glaze not beaten 
(No. 2), either while or pink, and then ornamented 
with white egg-icing in wreath or vine and leaf 
patterns down the whole length; or lines, or 
bands may be run down, and between the lines of 
icing run lines of currant jelly; or, place sugar 
flowers, crystallized fruits or small ornamental 
candies. Another way is to moisten the outside 
with water icing thinly spread with a knife and 
then roll in pink sugar-sand or granite sugar, 
which is of a larger grain.

ADVERTISEMENT, 



THIS BOOK is especially adapted for use in Hotels, Boarding-Houses, 
Confectionery-Caf^s, Restaurants and Eating-Houses generally, in which 
respect it enters upon a field hitherto unoccupied. The quantities of the 
receipts are calculated for what experience has taught the author are the, 
average orders of about fifty persons choosing from a bill of fare, but 
which are really only about thirty portions. In many of the more import-, 
ant matters, such as Puff Paste, Bread and Eolls, Cakes, Ices, Creams, and 
Pie Mixtures, and in Cold Meat Dishes, Corned Beef management, and 
Salads, the standard of one pound or quart used will be found to make the 
receipts equally useful for private families, and the trouble of dividing the 
larger quantities in other cases will probably be fully repaid by the simple 
conciseness of the directions, the absence of all technical jargon, and the 
professional knowledge of the art of cookery imparted in every page. The 
book is unique also in having all the articles directed to be made graded 
in regard to cost, to meet the requirements both of those who do cooking 
fov pleasure and those who are concerned in cooking for profit. 



Since the above was first printed another book has been issued by the 
same author, in which all of the receipts are reduced to the guage of meals 
for six or eight. It is especially adapted to teach cooking as a trade for 
women in private houses, and includes everything likely to be of use for 
the purpose, arranged in order from the cheapest meals up to party dinners 
and suppers. It is called the Chicago Herald Cooking School. 



Introductory in the National Hotel Reporter. 



For any apparent presuraptuousness there may be 
in spreading these cooking receipts and instructions 
before the professed cooks of the country in the most 
widely circulated and most influential hotel journal, 
I have to oflFer as apology that I was long ago im- 
pressed with the singular fact, that among all the ex- 
cellent cooks, hardly any could be found who worked 
by any rule or measure. This was especially the 
case with American cooks. They knew how them- 
selves, but could not have given exact instructions 
even to their sons without first instituting a series of 
experiments, and their knowledge perished with 
them. I simply set to work to reduce my portion of 
the general knowledge to exact figures, and the merit 
claimed therefore is not for very extraordinary 
skill, but rather for the painstaking industry that 
has never allowed a receipt to be put away marked 
0. K., without being satisfied that it was quite re- 
liable. 

Another consideration offered is, that the stewards, 
and others, who buy for cooks to use, not being, in 
the great majority of ca«es, practical cooks them- 
selves, are apt to consider many of the demands of 
the cooks for certain kinds of materials necessary to 
good work, as but unreasonable whims, not worthy 
of notice, and it is difficult to see how the requisite 
explanations are ever to be made, unless through 
some such means and medium as the present,

RECEIPT OR RECIPE? 



' Which is right ? Worcester says that a recipe is a 
receipt for cooking ; also, that it is a formulary or 
prescription for mixing certain articles, particularly 
in medicine. Webster, also, makes recipe and re- 
ceipt appear nearly synonymous terms, and attaches 
to the former a particularly medical meaning that is 
nowhere made to belong to the other.. The French 
recette, which appears to be the original of our re- 
ceipt, is pronounced like it; and yet all the translated 
French books have recipe inst-ead. Of half a dozen 
different articles on the grocer's shelves, four have 
recipes printed on the packages while others give re- 
ceipts. Of six persons talking together, four or five 
will say recipe, the rest receipt. The label on the 
bottle tells you that the sauce beside your plate was 
prepared from the receipt of a nobleman of the 
county. But the nobleman's only authoritative 
English cook-book uses recipe. By its side is another 
later and very compendious work which is adver- 
Ssed as containing so many thousand receipts. Still 
another more recent and even more compendious 
London book, uses the other word. Both words are 
right, but which is the better ? 

Several hundred pages of the matter which it is 
proposed to publish in this column, had been writ- 



ten with the word recipe, according to the observed 
practice of the majority, but after all it was decided 
to change it, and for reasons perhaps as immaterial 
as the difference between the two words in question. 
Still, the minority side having been taken, it seems 
best to state the case. 

A city man, wise in the ways of bread making, 
was at an old Yankee farmer's house instructing 
his housekeeper in the best methods of making home- 
made Boston brown bread, and used the word recipe 
frequently. The old man was not illiterate, but ex- 
cessively old-fashioned, and the trisyllable annoyed 
him past bearing. He laid down the Churchman that 
he had been reading, and leaned back and listened. 
Then he took off his glasses. Then he began to re- 
monstrate. "Oh, don't bring those affected city 
words among us plain people. 'Recipee,' " he re- 
peated, with immeasurable contempt. "My parents 
always said receipt ; my neighbors all say receipt, 
what would they think of us if we should go among 
them putting on such airs as that ?' ' 

As I overheard this, and a cutting phillipic which 
followed, aimed at city affectations in general, my 
faith in the power of high-sounding recipe to soothe 
the savage breast was considerably weakened. A long 
time after, and at a very distant place, a lady school 
teacher was heard to say: "lam so glad if receipt is 
the right word instead of recipe ; the latter seems so 
much like a stranger in a foreign dress among our 
familiar English words of the same dimensions. 
When I have taught my pupils to indite and recite, 
it is troublesome to make them understand that rec- 
ipe is not to be pronounced that way at all, and then, 
again, to stop them from making two syllables of 
ripe, wipe, and pipe." 

This was another blow at the aristocratic trisyllable, 
but it seemed hard to have to descend from the lofty 
heights where it prevailed to the level of the com- 
mon. Fortunately, just at that time, the great house 
of the Harpers published the most polite cook-book 
that has yet appeared. It made extreme correctness 
a special feature. It was typographically perfect. 
It hyp'henated every cocoanut It split hairs on tea- 
spoonful. It followed Noah Webster whithersoever 
he might lead. It was "the glass of fashion and the 
mould — I mean mold — of form," and with all this it 
adopted receipt instead of recipe. 

There was no more room for doubt. Higher prece- 
dent there could not be, and so, if the reader pleases, 
as far as this column is concerned, we will render 
unto the doctors the Latin trisyllable which is their, 
and use only the humbler but safer English receipt. 



NOTES TO THE SECOND EDITION, 



The "American Pastry Cook" having met with so 
much favor that a second edition has become neces- 
sary, it may perhaps be allowed me to make a state- 
ment of the simple origin of the book, as much as 
anything in acknofrledgment of the kind encourage- 
ment of a great number of frionds who bought un- 
doubtedly without any thought of using it. All 
such books, if worth considering at all, have had a 
motive, either to introduce foreign methods, found 
a new school of cookery, teach new extremes of or- 
namentation, or put into practice the theories of 
great chemists or of new idea doctors — Leibig, 
Graham, the vegetarians and the like. The <-Oven 
and Range ' series was not so deliberately planned 
and if a motive may be claimed in this case it is to 
make good cooks, such as are always wanted, and 
to raise the occupation of cooks in America at least 
to the dignity of a recognized trade. 

When, a good many years ago, I used to find my- 
self in positions on sea and river, in hotels and re- 
taurants where the assistants always coming and 
going were generally willing enough while they 
stayed, but could not do good work, I began to see 
the absurdity of knowing what I wanted done and 
yet being unable to ma'-je others understand, and I 
began pencilling down weights, measures and direc- 
tions for Lhem to work by — not pastries alone but a 
little of everything— and hanging these directions 
on the nails along with each assistant's portion of 
the bill of fare for the next meal. All coo? s that 
are worthy of being called such are emulative and 
try to excel. They "hit it exactly" in making a 
dish, sometimes, are highly elated and wish they 
could always have such "good luck." In my own 
practice whenever any of us "hit it exactly" I 
simply penciled dosvnhow it was done, and kept on 
changing and improving until I was in a great 
measure independent of the circumstances of the 
boys "jumping out;" anybody smart enough to 
work by written directions could make what I told 
them. These receipts were necessarily plain, and 
as necessarily correct and reliable, and they were 
of great value. In course of time there were some 
hundreds of them and they made a bulky package. 
Is there any wonder that the thought occurred that 
they would be more u.seful in print? Is there any 
need to explain further why the writer has confi- 
dence in his book ? Those exact and plainly word- 
ed receipts, with others of course added, form the 
• Oven and Range" cook books. There has been 
nothing but pleased surprise, kind words and good 



reports connected with the circulation of the pastry 
book as far as it has gone already, the anxiety being 
expressed in numberless instances to obtain more' 
books of the same sort. The careful plan adopted of 
making the work reliable in every particular has 
prevented its being written and finished in haste. 



Little Desserts.— This book has been taken 
up with avidity by many outside of hotels, seeiiing 
instructions how to make nice sweet dishes, some 
of whom seem to think they know all they need to 
learn of meat cooking when they can broil and fry, 
but who acknowledge the difficulty that prevails 
everywhere when well-to-do people ask why they 
cannot have at least a few of the dainty trifles at 
their private tables that thoy have enjoyed in such 
profusion at a few very good hotels. It is, briefly, 
because pastry-cooking cannot be picked up like 
meat frying, but must be learned. In order to help 
the matter I will suggest things to be tried. Let 
those who would not have pies every day and only 
pies, practice the difi"erent cream fillings and make 
all sorts of delectable forms of pastry of them. I 
have called some of these conserves because the 
word cream is worked to death. The articles allud- 
ed to are pineapple creamer conserve, apple cream, 
orange conserve or tart filling, lemon conserve or 
lemon honey, transparent pie mixture, cocoanut and 
lemon pie mixtures, pastry cream or custard, choco- 
late cream, cheese curd mixtures, and many more 
that are in the book but which need not be named. 
Let it be observed that all of the receipts for mak- 
ing them are perfectly reliable and they can be 
taken up and used any time without fear of failure. 
This will be found a perfect little mine of good 
things. When they are understood make tarts in 
patty pans of them, then covered tarts, then cheese 
cakes, apple shortcake. Napoleon cake, Saratoga 
shortcake, apple turnovers, mince patties, using the 
difi'crcnt creams or sweets at difi'erent times. Then 
make the open tarts with meringue on top like 
lemon pies; make apple shortcakes with meringue 
or frosting on top or between the layers, and so you 
can keep on indefinitely. 

Tlien take notice of the fruit charlottes, the apple 
and peach charlottes and friar's omelet. Since the 
book has been published I have seen two of the most 
accomplished French cooks of this part of the 
country practicing those articles with others from it 
with evident interest and satisfaction — for it doei 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



not follow because a man is a splendid cook already 
that he must have practiced everything that is 
Vnown; we are all still learning or trying some old 
favorite for the first time. 

Then, attention should be paid to the many 
varieties of boiled custards in cups. There are 
tapioca custard, rice, farina, sago, manioca, granula 
cocoanut, chocolate, caramel, wine, and plain cus- 
tards flavored. The receipts give you the exact 
proportions to malte them so that everybody likes 
them, and they direct you to serve them ice cold. 
There are custards with whipped cream on top, and 
with frosting browned over, and custards baked 
and steamed. Then remember the different dishes 
made with cake and custard, the floating islands, 
the gipsey pudding and then the diff'erent ways of 
making a charlotte russe. 

I write these lines in the interest of people who 
want nice things on their tables and not caring par- 
ticularly about the cost wish to know how it is that 
cooks in general have such a very limited know- 
ledge of this line of business. As the utmost pains 
has been bestowed upon the book in the hope to 
supply this deficiency of knowledge I can do no 
less than point them and their cooks to these pages. 

Then there are the molded creams, which to know 
how to make perfectly is a pleasing art in itself; 
they are the blanc manges, the Bavarian, chocolate, 
strawberry, Roman and all that line. Most of the 
finest foreign menus have Bavarian cream in some 
form or under some name as Bavaroise auzfraises 
(with strawberries) or au chocolat, or o herwise, 
and many of the diplomatic and court banquets 
show the same. They all can be easily made and 
are simple when once learned. I have always found 
that something of the sort is highly appreciated at 
the end of a dinner, particularly whea there is no 
icecream. 

While claiming to excel in making these creams 
myself and having made others working under me 
excel in the same line of articles, I must own that 
I would not, to use the common expression, touch 
with a ten-foot pole these so-called creams as they 
are commonly made by unskillful cooks. But they 
are served daily in great perfection at a few of the 
very best Chicago hotels. Everything necessary to 
be said about them has been set down in the dl 
rections in the book. 

The puddings alone will furnish a change and 
variety that may surprise many who try them, and 
some are so little like pudding they seem to de- 
serve a finer name. Where all are good it is 
scarcely fair to single out any, yet, to point the 
meaning I wi 1 instance the birds-nest pudding as 
being almost a dish of baked fruit, and, not least, 
there remain the fritters both plain and with fruit, 
meringues of cake and Jruit and pastry and fruit, 
frosted over, and jellies and compotes, and every 
one who delights in making little desserts is con- 



tinually inventing some new combination. And 
we have not yet mentioned the ice creams. 



About Whipped Oream — In close con- 
nection with the Bavarian and Italian creams the 
pure whipped cream regarded as most delicious 
among desserts has to be considered. Those creams 
when genuine are made of pure cream whipped to 
froth and stiffened with gelatine. 

The amount of gelatine required is only half an 
ounce to a quart of cream when it is but to fill a 
charlotte russe, or be a simple cream in a mold, 
but if strawberry juice and pulp is to be added 
or maraschino or wine then an ounce to a quart 
will be needed. If you put pure cream in a deep 
pan, set it on ice and be at with the wireegg-whisk it 
will become thick and firm enough to fill small 
charlottes without anythingaddedat all, except, of 
course, a little sugar and flavoring, and it will not 
go down again as long as it is kept cold. 

When the greater firmness is wanted so that it 
can be turned out of a mold the half-ounce of gel- 
atine to a quart must be dissolved in a little warm 
milk and poured into the cream while you are 
whipping it light. 

But there is so much difficulty in most hotels in 
getting cream for the pastry cook to use that I 
have about given up the use of it altogether. It is 
not always the question of cost that makes the dif- 
ficulty but the actual scarcity of cream and the 
greater need for it in other ways than in the pastry, 
so the receipts for the made creams and charlottes 
will be found to call for no cream, but use milk in- 
stead, They can be made so good that the lack of 
cream is never observed. The difficulty does not 
so generally exist when parties in private houses 
are to be given and I advise the use of pure cream 
when possible, although it is valuable to know how 
to do without. 



Individual Oharlotte-Russe.— A favorite 
little dainty of this sort is sold at the city confec- 
tioneries that is made in a paper case, size and 
shape of a common tin cup of the half pint size. A 
sheet of sponge cake is baked on paper, taken oflF 
and cut in pieces that will just fit inside the cases, 
a bottom piece is put in and then the charlotte is 
filled with a spoontnl of whipped cream, sweetened 
and flavored but whipped up without gelatine. 
But they are made for fine parties in paper cases of 
the shape of small tumblers, wider at top than at 
bottom so that they can be taken out of the 
case when served, as the pattern with straight- 
up sides cannot. These are lined with either cake 
or lady fingers, but Im give them firmness enough 
to be removed from the cases a little gelatine has 
to be added to the pure cream, as explained in the 
note about whipped cream. 

But another way most suitable of all when these 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



3 



little charlottes are to be served at ball suppers, as 
they can be held in gloved fingers, is to make them 
in handsome ornamented paper cases, size of small 
tumblers which may be bought ready made for the 
purpose in some places or otherwise can be made of 
fine unruled paper at home. The lining may be 
sometimes of white cake and another time of yel- 
low, and either pure whipped cream or any of the 
made creams can be used for filling. The same 
sort of charlottes are held in high favor at hotel 
dinners when they are formed in deep muflBn rings 
without bottoms, kept very cold and slipped out 
of the rings when served. I have practiced that 
more than any other way. A cup of pure thick 
cream when whipped fills about eight of these small 
charlottes, so that a calculation can be made of 
how much will be required. 



Individual Puddings.— It is the practice in 
all the best hotels to serve the puddings in individ- 
ual forms. In the receipts in this book it will be 
found that the baked puddings are all directed to 
be cooked first by boiling the main ingredients to- 
gether then adding the eggs and then to be baked 
only a short time. This baking is done in white 
bowls that hold from a cupful to a pint and the 
puddings are served in the same bowl set in a plate 
and an individual pitcher of sauce with it, if the 
pudding needs a sauce, for family dinners granite 
ware or tin dishes are in use with an outside silver- 
plated dish to hold it and a plated ring to drop 
over and cover the rim. Custard puddings, mac- 
aroon, brandy, cabinet and a number of others de- 
scribed in the book can be cooked in the cups and 
then turned out in the saucers to serve. Boiled or 
steamed puddings can be cooked in individual tin 
molds and turned out on saucers. 

An improved way of cooking steamed apple roll 
and other fruit puddings of the same sort is prac- 
ticed in places where the steaming facilities are 
good. The pudding is not a roll at all and no 
cloth is used, but a crust rolled out is laid on the 
bottom of a pan, then a layer of chopped apples, 
another crust, more apples and a third crust on top, 
then it is set in the steamer, cut out slices or 
squares. It is but little trouble and does just as 
well. A light dough made with plenty of baking 
powder and no shortening whatever is employed in 
some of the paying restaurants for steamed apple 
roll. 



Ices. — Let none be deceived about the ices in 
this book because they are offered without the im. 
poseiveness of tremendous French names. There is 
no finer assortment of ices known than these in the 
following pages. The changes and combinations 
possible with them are practically endless and one 
who is master of them need have no fear of ever 
"getting left ' in a competitive trial. It is hard to 



say in such matters as these exactly where old pat- 
terns are departed from and originality begins. It 
is true, however, that these are all newly adap. 
ted to hotel use being on the whole an invention of 
a set of ways of serving a magnificent array of ices in 
places where the resort to molds and brick shapes- 
was not possible with the small number of hands 
employed and perhaps the comparative scarcity of 
ice. I keep up a constant run of novelties by serv- 
ing two kinds at once in the same saucer or glass 
and making ices of almost every kind of sweet and 
fruity material. In order to do this without mak- 
ing incongruous mixtures less acceptable than com- 
mon ice cream the greatest care and skill must be 
exercised both in compounding, coloring and freez- 
ing. Even if we make the o'd foreign favorites 
they have to be supplied with plainer names for 
hotel bills of fare. Take for instance "tutti-frutti;" 
when the hotel keeper has ice cream provided he of 
course wants the guests to know it and get the good 
of it, but not one in a hundred of them that come to 
hotels knows what tutti-frutti is by that name, and 
much disappointment may be felt on that account. 
I would not be understood as advising the use 
of even the terms attached in this book to the sev- 
eral combinations. That is a matter of indiflfer- 
ence. When you have two fancy ices at once, per- 
haps a pale green grape ice and a deep colored 
frozen custard call it ice cream in the style of your 
hotel or of some other famous one. In regard to 
the tutti-frutti receipt in the book it ought perhaps 
to be said that the outer coating of orange ice is 
not necessary for common dinners, it is an extra 
touch for a mold or bombe. This sort of frozen 
pudding can be dished out of ■^he freezer with or 
without a white ice like a frozen sauce at the side. 
The sense of some of these extras is never appar- 
ent until you have a table decorated with crystal, 
china and flowers to supply. The best workmen 
after they have made the three creams or fruit 
ices for Neapolitan and frozen them in brick- 
shaped or Neapolitan molds take them out a good 
while before dinner time, wrap each form after it 
is taken out of the mold in manilla paper and put 
them in a large freezer well packed with ice and 
salt and keep them there frozen and dry until they 
are wanted. This saves hurry and melting by 
handling while dinner is going on. Line your 
brick molds with manilla paper, or at least the 
bottom and top, before putting in the ice cream. 
It is easier to take the cream out and also makes 
the lids fit tighter. 



Bread. — A good deal of wholesome enthusiasm 
has been evoked by the contents of the "book of 
breads;" the slight drawback has been that those 
who followed out the proper method of wording 
the dough have been surprised by their bread be- 
coming too light; that is of being ready to bake 



TEE AMERICAN PASTBY COOK. 



before they believed it could be and before they 
were ready for it. It is stated in the directions 
that under proper methods the dough needs no 
coaxing, no setting under the stove, it will rise al- 
most anywhere. A hint may be ta^.en from the 
management of Vienna bread, the dough for which 
is made light once, then well kneaded, made into 
loaves, cut across tlie tops and baked very soon 
after without being allowed to get much proof or 
rising in the loaf shape. It is put into an oven 
that is very hot at first but bui t with a low roof so 
that the bread crowded in fills the oven with steam 
in which the baking is finished. Ovens not spe- 
cially built for Vienna bread have a steam pipe 
leading into the oven to serve the same purpose, 
and rotary ovens have wet bricks thrown into the 
fire to fill the oven with steam. However interest- 
ing the subject it will generally be found too much 
tfouble to make stock yeast in very small houses, 
but a starting may be obtained from some 
friendly ba'Acr or else dry yeast cakes must be 
used to start the ferment. An attempt to do too 
much is very apt to end in weariness. But alj 
pastry cooks ought to make stock sometimes, to 
keep in practice, even if they are using the com- 
pressed in a regular way. 

Attention is particularly called to the method 
in this book of taking a piece of light dough from 
the rolls or bread to make various light fancy 
breads, muffins, waffles and the like. It not only 
makes the directions short and plain but makes it 
easy to turn out a great variety with but little ex- 
tra trouble over common bread. One setting of 
sponge does for everything. 



Plain Covered Pies- — It has happened sev- 
eral times during the introduction of the first 
edition that I have had to bear unfavorable com- 
ments upon the pies and pastries of some gener- 
ally good workmen, in the form of a hope by the 
steward, clerk, or proprietor, as the case has hap- 
pened to be, that the book would give them a hint 
to make the old fashioned covered pies, and not 
the heavy and greasy ones they were making. It 
is much to be feared that our book has fal'en short 
of its duty in this particular; still it has been said 
over and over that pufF paste is not good unless it 
is perfect or nearly so. Sonic kitchens and pastry 
rooms are so hot it is impossible to make fine paste 
in them, and, after all, the greater number of peo- 
ple are as well or better pleased with good short 
paste. Take two cups of lard to seven cups of 
flour — or a pound of shortening to two pounds of 
flour and a little salt and rub them together dry, 
wet them with ice water, mix up and give the 
lump of paste two or three rollings in order to 
make it fla'-^y. The same sort of paste but moi'e 
crisp and dry can be made with suet chopped ex- 
tremely fine, weighing or otherwise making sure 



that you have enough. But when suet is used it 
will be found best to mix up with water slightly warm 
that the suet may be soft enough to spread and be 
flaky under the rolling-pin, and then let the paste 
stand in a cold place until wanted. Good cooking 
apples and other pie fruits can be put in the pie 
raw and a little sugar sprinkled over, then a top 
crust put on. These after all, are the real American 
pies; our open pies with fine high puff pate edges 
are tourtes, flans and vols-au vent. 



Strawberry Shortcake. — Some dissatisfac- 
tionhas been expressed at the strawberry shortcaRe 
question being left in this book in an unsettled 
condition. But it is a fact as everybody knows 
that when strawberries first come in all the con" 
fectioners' windows display different kinds of straw" 
berry shortcake that are anything but the true ar' 
tide, being sometimes squares of sweet cake with 
strawberries on top and whipped white of egg 
on that — as little like the proper thing as it possi- 
bly can be. I have no hesitation now in saying 
these are all wrong and the only genuine article is 
made as I was schooled into making it myself years 
ago by the wife of the present Secretary of the In. 
terior, one of the most critical judges of cookery, 
as she is herself one of the most accomplished 
cooks among all the ladies in the land. 

Make the short paste as directed in the preced- 
ing note for covered pies, only using fresh butter 
to rub in the flour instead of lard. Roll out nearly 
as thick as for biscuits, place on jelly cake pans 
and bake. Cover the strawberries with powdered 
sugar in a bowl and shake them up to mix. Split 
the short cake, spread strawberries on both halves 
and place one on top of the other. There will be 
strawberries, of course, on top as well as between. 
Serve a pitcher of cold sweet cream at the side. 
There should not be baking powder or any other 
sort of rising in this cake but the cold butter alone, 
which makes it light enough. 



City and Country Pastry Cooks.— Hay- 
ing paid attention in the foregoing notes to some 
things that they in the front of the house have said, 
it is in turn to mention that some pastry cooks 
claim that it takes a much smarter man to be a first- 
class pastry cook or meat cook either in a country ho- 
tel or a hotel in any small city than it does in a per- 
fectly fitted-up great house in New York or Chica- 
go. It is argued with perfect justice that in these 
great establishments one man does but one set of 
duties within certain hours and has everything 
properly ada ted for his use, and such a one could not 
begin to do as well as the general pastry cook in 
the ordinary hotels of small cities does with all the 
deficiencies and disadvantages he has to contend 
with. This thing properly considered by employ- 
ers would often save them the disappointments 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



they experience when, thinking they will be made 
up and get their work done right, they send for a 
pastry cook from the big city and find that he 
either cannot or will not try to get along when 
they have got him. The young men that have 
learned and practiced only one department of hote^ 
cooking are not the ones that give satisfaction in 
small houses. The pastry cooks of these houses 
have to invent their own ways, and learn to do 
splendid work under conditions that would make 
the others afraid to take hold and try. On account 
of his thus becoming used to adapting himself to 
the place, the oven, and the utensils the chances 
are much better for getting a great variety of first- 
class pastry work from an active, interested, gen- 
eral pastry cook who has learned in hotels of med- 
ium size than from those under the steady routine 
of the great caravansaries Hotel keepers should 
encourage the training of pastry cooks in their 
own ways in their own houses, as there are no 
other places for them to learn general work in. 

About Ovens. — Brick ovens are indisputably 
the best for hotels, yet, because they are not very 
often met with, when one is put in, the pastry 
cook who has been used to baking in a portable 
sheet iron oven or a range or stove, finds it awk- 
ward to begin the new way. Good pie baking can 
be done in the portable ovens for they will bake on 
the bottom, and good use can be made of the top of 
the fire box to boil jelly and stew fruit when room 
on the range is not to be had, but still they are 
Very imperfect; they scorch the bread on one side, 
they are entirely unsuitable for baking cake and 
will not keep anything hot without drying the bot- 
tom and sweating the top. There is an immense 
number of them in use, although many pastry 
cools' s and bakers will not work with them at all. 
The same money that buys them would build a 
brick oven. Every town has one or more bricklayers 
or builders who can build an oven, and some have 
a specialty in that line. It will cost from forty or 
fifty dollars upwards to a hundred and fifty or 
more for an ordinary oven. The patent rotary 
ovens run from five hundred to fifteen hundred 
dollars. They are for the largest establishments. 
The floor rotates over the fire, the heat comes up 
through a hole or hub in the center and around the 
circumference, the door is rarely closed but the ar- 
ticles put in as the bottom passes the door are car, 
ried around and, if small, when they come to the 
door again they are done. Revolving ovens carry 
the shelves and pans up and down, baking all over 
alike. Common ovens are of two patterns. The 
simplest and cheapest has no furnace but the fire is 
made in the oven itself, on the floor, and when hot 
enough the oven is raked out and mopped clean 
and the articles put in. Only one heat at a time 
can be had and the things that need the most heat 



go in first, then the bread, after that the cakes. 
The other sort has a furnace at the side, the heat 
goes into the oven on its way to the chimney hole 
in the top. It may be known when the oven is hot 
and where the cool corners are by the smoke that 
blackens it all over when the fire is first made but 
disappears and leaves the bricks white when they 
are hot. When you have an oven built be careful 
to stipulate for a good bed of sand under the tile 
bottom. It holds heat and is essential to the mak- 
ing of a good oven. After a few days practice one 
who has not been used to an ovon learns how long 
before it is wanted the fire must be started to heat 
it, and learns by the feel and by the appearance of 
the inside when it is at the right heat for any pur- 
pose. 



Jelly Roll — On account of the common diffi- 
culty of getting blank paper to use I have done my 
part towards abolishing the need of it by baking 
sheets of sponge on baking pans without paper. 
Very few, however, can manage it quickly enough 
and the cake dries and breads. Newspapers can 
not be used for the purpose because they are apt 
to leave the news of the day impressed on the cake 
in printing ink. Either thin manilla or blank news 
paper should be furnished to the pastry room. 



By Weight and Measure. — It pays to have 
scales and be exact. The pastry cook does not 
want the pudding to come out soft and slop ove** 
the saucers, nor the lemon pie to be soft and run 
off the crust, so he throws in a lot more eggs if he 
cooks by guess, because he knows they [[will cook 
solid and dry it up. Or, he wants another pud- 
ding to be soft and mellow and he throws in a lot 
more butter, knowing that will prevent it being 
dry and tough. But in most cases the extra eggs 
used only to make sure of a doubt do more harm 
than good, and the softness, like custard, that is 
wanted can be produced better by adding water or 
milk than by butter. The whole course of guess 
work cooking is full of errors. The objection that 
weighing takes up too much time must bo met by 
placing scales and weights in a position where they 
are always ready for instant use, on a little shel^ 
nailed up about breast high at the back or end o^ 
the pastry table. Spring balances are of no use be. 
cause they will not weigh by ounces. Common 
scales with common iron weights are by all odds 
the best, for graded beams take too much attention 
lo find small quantities. The scales onee placed in 
easy reach there is nothing more needed to be done 
to get them into use, for the pastry cook is too glad 
to have "a dead sure thing" on whatever he does, 
and no failures, to neglect the weighing that is 
made easy. There are certain proportions of ingred- 
ients in every article that make it so good it is im- 
possible for it to be made any better — even in common

things lilte batter cakes and biscuits — and no person 
living can guess them and be always up to the high- 
est mark. 



Oup and Spoon Measure. 



Cooks who go to places where there are no scales 
to use will find the following table useful. 

A CUP — Means the common size of white coffee 
cup generally used in hotels, that holds half a 
pint. 

Water — "A pint is a pound all the world round" 
and the standard, A cup being ^ pint is therefore 8 
ounces. 

Milk, vinegar and most fluids same as water. 

Molasses — A cup holds 12 ounces a basting 
spoon 2 ounces. Thin syrups do not weigh so 
heavy. 

Eqos — A cup of eggs broken is the same ae 5 

eggs- 

Yolks — A cup holds 13 yolks — ^ pound. 

Whites — A cup holds 9 whites — ^ pound. 

Whole eggs — 10 average a pound. When you 
have a bowl of yolks or whites left over weigh or 
measure and you will know how many there are. 

Butter — A cup of butter is 7J ounces if pressed 
in solid. It is near enough generally to call 2 cups 
butter a pound, either pressed in or melted. 

Lard — Same as butter. 

Suet — Minced suet a cup is 4 ounces. 

Chocolate — Grated cold chocolate a cup is 3 
ounces. 

Sugar — A level cup of granulated sugar is 7 
ounces. Although sugar by the grain is heavier 
than water the air spaces make it measure lighter. 
A rounded cup is ^ pound Fine icing sugar a cup 
is but 6 ounces, dry yellow the same. All the 
sugar that can be scooped up out of a barrel with a 
cup weighs 9 ounces. 

Bread Crumbs — A cup of bread pressed in rath- 
er sold is 4 ounces. A pound is a pressed-in quart 

Flour — A level cup of flour is 4 ounces. A cup 
heaped up with all that can be dipped with it out 
of a barrel weighs 7 ounces, nearly twice the level 
full. A quart of flour just rounded over is a pound. 

Corn-meal — A cup of corn-meal is 5 ounces, 8 



rounded cups are a pound. A pound is a little less 
than a level quart. 

Oatmeal — A level cup is 6 ounces. All that can 
be dipped up with a cup weighs 7 ounces — nearly ^ 
pound. 3 cups water cooks 1 cup oatmeal. 

Rice — A level cup weighs 7 ounces. All that 
can be heaped iu a cup weighs 9 ounces. 3 cups 
water cooks 1 cup rice. 

Corn starch — A level cup 3f cooking starch is 6 
ounces. All that can be heaped in a cup weighs 7 
ounces. 4 cups milk cooks 1 cup starch. 

Farina — Same as starch. 

Tapioca — Same as rice. 

Light bread dough — A rounded cup of dough 
weighs from 6 to 8 ounces according to lightness — 
3 cups are a pound. 1 pound makes 10 or 12 rolls- 

Raisins — A heaped cup without stems is 8 ounces. 
A pound without stems about fills a quart. 

Currants — A heaped cup dry weighs 6 ounces 

Ground coffee — A heaping cup is 4 ounces — it 
makes 2 quarts of coffee. 

Tea — A heaping cup is 2 ounces — it makes 4 
quarts of tea. 

Oysters — A cup holds a dozen selects or 2 dozen 
small. 

A basting-spoon — Six basting-spoons of liquid 
fill a cup. It holds about 1^ ounces of melted but- 
ter or lard, same as size of an egg, and 2 ounces of 
thick molassess. 

A TABLE-SPOON — 14 tiffics quitc full is a cup or J 
pint. 2 tablespoons butter is 1 ounce, melted. A 
heaping tablespoon of sugar is 1 ounce, 6 or 7 fill a 
cup. A heaping tablespoon of starch is 1 ounce, 4 
will fill a cup — starch can be heaped so much high- 
er than sugar. A moderately heaped tablespoon of 
flour is 1 ounce, 3 will fill a cup if fully heaped. 

A TEA-SPOON — Is ^ a tablespoon. It is near 
enough in most cases to call a teaspoonful ^ ounce 
of dry articles rounded up, not including ground 
coffee or tea. 

Apples — 4 average a pound — they lose a third 
by paring. 

Butter -Size of an egg is anything from 1 to 2 
ounces. 

There are 16 cups in a gallon. 

A common wooden pail holds 2J gallons or 10 
quarts or 40 cups. 



Bisque Ice Creams — Sometimes called biscuit ices 
in bills of fare are those which have a paste o* 
fruit or nuts mixed wiih the cream. Bisque of 
pineapple i^ one of the favorite varieties, the 
ilirections for making it are at Nos. 107 and 93- 
Another example U the bisque of nuts of any 
J:ind at No. 95, and preserved or candied ginger 



makes another. There should be bils of the 
minced fruit found in the ice to show what it is, 
and that it is not mere'y flavored. 

Italian bisque has lady fingers crumbled and 
moistened in wine, mixed in ice cream the same 
way. Nesselrode Ice Pudding and Diplomatic Ice 
Pudding will be found at Nos. 689 and 690. 



NOTES TO THE FOURTH EDITION, 



Tortillas. — It would be most gratifying to me 
if these books should grow to be so comprehen- 
sivelj American as to include the best of the 
cookerj of all the various peoples on the conti- 
nent. To learn all that is charcteristic in the 
cookery of Mexico without departing from my 
rule of never putting anything into a book that I 
had not previously performed myself by the 
measures and directions given I should have to 
go through the experience of a correspondent, a 
former Chicago chef, and visit the principal cities 
of that country. He says : 

" In looking over your American Pastry 
Cook I particularly noticed No. 626 (Tortillas) 
which I find is a mistake. I have spent the past 
two years in Old Mexico, most of the time as 
proprietor of the Eating House at San Juan del 
Rio, about 125 miles from the City of Mexico, 
and have seen Tortillas made in all the principal 
cities in Mexico and at no place do they use corn 
meal or boiling water, as there is not, nor never 
has been, such a thing as corn meal in Mexico, 
only such as came from the United States to 
Americans located there. The way they do make 
Tortillas is as follows : Corn is soaked in water 
24 hours, then it is laid on a rock and rubbed 
with another rock shaped something like a rolling 
pin till it forms a paste, then it is made into flat 
cakes like a hotel pancake, only thin as a wafer, 
which are made by being patted between the 
hands to the proper size, then are baked on hot 
coals. As a proof of the above recipe I refer you 
to any one in Mexico." 

My friend " Al " Rutherford is right, of course. 
Still my Mexican said just what is printed about 
him. Knowing that a tortilla is a corn cake, he 
was content to call a corn cake a tortilla without 
caring much about the different method of mak- 
ing. Here is a still more particular description 
written by Fannie Brigham Ward to the Spring- 
field Republican : 

" A Mexican kitchen is a study, and to do it 
and all its queer utensils justice would require a 
column's space. There are no cooking stoves in 
Mexico, or even anything like the fire-places of 
our grandmothers' days. One side of the room 
was occupied by a sort of shelf, built into the 
wall, about breast high, in the center of which a 
small wood fire, i? kept burning. 

" There is no wood here which a New England 
housewife would consider fit to burn — only the 



gnarled and twisted branches of mountain trees, 
and around a little heap of these the earthen 
cooking pots are ranged. If the family is small, 
sometimes this smoky process is improved upon 
by building a charcoal fire in a large earthen pot 
and setting the smaller cooking vessels within it. 
In many houses a mud oven is built at one end of 
this shelf, or somewhere out of doors. To heat 
the oven a fire must be built inside of it, and the 
entrance closed with a hot stone. However, as 
baked food — ' pies an' things,' according to the 
Englishman's advertisement — enter not into the 
household economy, an oven is altogether a super- 
fluous luxury. 

" In the center of the kitchen stands its most im- 
portant factor, the metate, for tortilla-making. It 
is a hollowed stone, the size of an ordinary bread 
bowl, having two stone legs, about six inches 
high, at one end, which inclines it at an angle of 
45 degrees. The tortilla-maker kneels on the dirt 
floor at the elevated end of the metate, and, the 
corn having been previously boiled in weak lye, 
and still quite wet, she crushes it into paste with 
a stone rolling-pin, the mixture gradually sliding 
down the inclined plane into a dish placed to re- 
ceive it. When a quantity has been thus crushed, 
it is rolled into balls and left until required. It is 
astonishing what an amount of corn a family of 
srdinary size will consume in a day, in the form 
of tortillas, the Mexican ' staff of life.' 

" When a meal is on the tapis, the last act in the 
drama — the tragedy, we feel inclined to say, 
when suffering the after pangs of indigestion — is 
to heat the griddle, or more commonly a smooth 
flat stone. Then the cook takes a very small 
lump at once of the prepared corn paste and 
shapes it into thin round cakes, with a little water 
and much loud spatting of the hands, with a 
sound exactly like spanking babies. The cakes 
are then baked brown in a jiffy, and, as a substi- 
tute for bread, one might go further and fare a 
great deal worse than subsist on tortillas. 

" Whatever else American housekeepers may 
find worthy of imitation in Mexican methods, I 
am sure that dish- washing, as that disagreeable 
duty is practiced here, will not be one of them. 
The Mexican dish-washer does not bother with a 
table and thereby saves her arms from scrubbing 
and her legs from standing — but seats herself 
serenely on the floor beside a pail of hot or cold 
water. She has no soap, but a little sliced amole

root makes a strong •■ and cleaner suds, and in 
lieu of a dishcloth she ases a tiny broom-brush 
like our smallest whisk brushes. 

"The only disagreeable suggestion about it is 
that these dish brooms are exactly like those used 
to brush hair — from the 'head of the family' 
down to that of the humblest criado (there are 
few combs used in Mexico) — and the fear will in- 
trude that those brooms may sometimes get 
'mixed,' like Buttercup's babies! The dishes 
are never viiped, but are turned up to dry, some- 
times in a tray or on an adobe shelf, but generally 
on the hard dirt floor leaned against the wall. 
Strange to say they always come to the table clean 
and shining. The brass spoons and steel-bladed 
knives are kept bright enough to see your face 
in, though no bath-bricks or patent soaps are em- 
ployed in their polishing — nothing but pure un- 
adulterated dirt. The servant, whose duty it is> 
takes them out of doors, kneels upon the ground, 
dips up a little fresh earth, and, holding the knife 
or spoon firmly on a stone, polishes at her leisure. 
Despite dirt floors and the absence of all those 
conveniences which we consider indispensable, I 
have never yet seen an untidy kitchen in Mexico. 
Everything is kept as bright and fresh as hands 
and amole can make it, even to the cooking pot- 
tery, which is of necessity smoked black when- 
ever used. If we could combine their innate 
neatness with our improved methods the result 
would be that cleanliness which we are told is 
* akin to godliness.' " 



that the foreigners would not recognize it. The 
real Turkish sherbet is nothing but fruit juice 
and water, only mixed with sugar when the acid- 
ity af the fruit makes it requisite. Turkish lemon 
sherbet is simply lemonade, and all other fruits 
are used in the same way. What we call water- 
ices are the real sherbets frozen ; both names are 
proper for them and there is no room for a dis- 
pute. On the other hand the French apply the 
name sorbet to sherbets which have liquors added 
to them; sorbet an kirsh is kirschwasser punch 
frozen and so on through the list of punches. It 
is easy therefore to find authority for almost any- 
thing in this line of goods with changeable names> 
for there is no ultimate authority at present to 
refer to. The popular understanding of the 
meaning of a term establishes it in each different 
country. 



A CORRESPONDENT having experience of life 
in Mexican hotels says the first thing to be done 
while there, according to the custom of the coun- 
try, is to " take " coffee — and if by any series of 
howls and poundings you can attract the atten- 
tion of a servant, there being no bells, the uni- 
versal light morning repast, called desagmio^ will 
be served in your room without extra charge. 
Nothing more substantial can be had " for love 
or money" before noon. It consists of a small 
loaf of Mexican bread (resembling a cannon ball), 
minus butter, accompanied by only a small cup 
of coffee or chocolate. Should you be so un- 
reasonable as to require a couple of eggs, they 
may be obtained for a small consideration from 
the astonished host, who marvels within himself 
at the greediness of " Los Americanos." 



Sherbets. — In regard to disputes which spring 
up touching the propriety of the names of certain 
compounds it is necessary to take into considera- 
tion that the English, French, and Americans, 
too, have in many cases taken up a foreign name 
and applied to something slightly like the foreign 
original, but so changed to suit their own fancies 



Ice Cups and Compound Ices. — The many 
friends who have assured me that they found this 
book a perfect mine of good things will not now, 
I am sure, suspect me of undue egotism, when I 
assert that a number of the compound ices have 
never been surpassed in points of luxury or orna- 
ment, and, if used in connection with the ice cups 
No. 1 1 8, they afford specialties for any occasion 
of which any one may be proud. These ice cups 
have been adopted by some experts in London, 
as a new thing and a few bills of fare of fine hotels 
in this country have " ice cups " called by the 
name of the hotel. I wish all my readers to get 
the full benefit of all the recipes that have been 
perfected for them with an amount of experi- 
mental labor that might seem to them incredible 
if told. 



Cooking in the Mountains.— When I first 
went to work in a very elevated town in the 
Rocky Mountains, at over 10,000 feet above sea 
level, I shared in the common surprise and per- 
plexity of all novices in that region of finding that 
many old recipes wouldn't work and times and du- 
rations of cooking processes were somehow disar- 
ranged. Without wishing to encourage the telling 
of marvelous stories about small variations, it has 
to be conceded that it is more difficult to cook vege- 
tables well done and to boil beef tender there 
than at the common levels and the most difficulty 
was found in making good cake. All the cus- 
tomary cake mixtures were too rich, they were 
all too light and after rising too much in the oven 
the cakes invariably went down again, dark and 
sticky, some of the cakes directed to be made 
with ammonia or baking powder or with whipped 
whites of eggs to make them light, would rise 
and run over, but if those raising materials were 
left out the cakes came out just right and light

enough. Still that did not meet the difficulty in 
many cases. People to w horn I tell it, but who 
have never experimented for themselves, do not 
want to believe that it was the sugar that needed 
to be changed in proportions — they will stiffen 
the cake with more flour or reduce the butter or 
eggs. But after testing it thoroughly I found that 
by leaving out a quarter of the sugar, good cake 
could be made at the highest point inhabited by 
man. The cakes were not as sweet and rich, of 
course, as if made by the full pound recipes, but 
they could be relied upon to be good in all other 
respects. Most of the cake recipes in this book 
are constructed on the knowledge that sugar in 
excess causes the most failures in cake baking 
and fourteen ounces are named instead of a pound. 
But at the level of the sea the full pound can be 
used, if wished. It is useful to know which of 
the ingredients causes the trouble when there 
*v any. 

Gauffres, Waffles and Wafer Caisses. — In 
reply to requests for further information about 
the copper patty case frier shown on page 59: It 
should be bent over so as to hang on the edge of 
the saucepan of lard and rest there without hold- 
ing. The copper head need not be solid, but is 
better if hollow. At the New Orleans Exposi- 
tion some waffle bakers had a booth where they 
fried a crisp sort of waffle or wafer, as is described 
on page 59 for cases, having their waffle irons or 
coppers as large around as a saucer, shaped indeed 
like a round border mould such as is shown on 
page 76, and having long handles bent over to 
rest on the edge of the frying kettle. They dipped 
the irons in cake batter, let them fry in hot fat 
and took off the wafer when done and dusted it 
with powdered sugar. The price they put upon 
their waffle irons was $15 per pair, but offered to 
sell to hotels at $10. It is not known how low 
they would really have sold them, if anybody 
had really wanted to buy. The cook who cannot 
obtain these utensils can get along very well for 
small caisses by merely dipping common tin patty 
pans of any shape in batter — the outsides only — 
dropping them in a kettle of hot lard and letting 
fry till light brown and crisp. Take off the shell 
of batter and dip the patty pans again. 



New Pudding Material. — Cerealine is a new 
starchy substance made of Indian corn. A strong 
effort has been made to introduce it to general 
use, and much money spent in advertising, but 
with doubtful success. The article is good, but 
so much like corn starch and so little better than 
any of the other pudding materials that nobody 
feels the need of it. It is, in the packages, pre- 
cisely like the white mealy part of popped corn. 
It cooks quickly like starch, and can be used in 
the same way as starch, farina and corn meal. 
Manioca is another article, not new, yet but little 
known, which is one of the most desirable pud- 
ding materials. It is a fine tapioca, and not fine 
rice, and makes the most delicate of puddings 
used in the same manner as sago and pearl ta- 
pioca. 

A FEW corrections and substiirutions of new 
or improved recipes for old ones have been made 
for this edition. I have been careful, however, not 
to change or disturb any of the special features of 
the book, which have been the means of bringing 
me so many kind and enthusiastic letters. 



An Invitation. — All cooks, pastry cooks, con- 
fectioners and bakers who execute ornamental 
pieces, which they would like to preserve in a 
picture, are respectfully invited to send photo- 
graphs of them to me to be engraved and inserted 
in the next edition of whichever of these books 
shall be reissued first thereafter. My latest pub- 
lished book, " Cooking for Profit," contains a de- 
partment for artistic cookery in which are pictures 
of two prize pieces, one of which took the first prize 
at the French Cooks' Exhibition in Paris, the other 
won a gold medal in London. It seems unfor- 
tunate that of all the fine pieces exhibited by the 
cooks at their annual banquets in New York and 
other cities, and of all the elaborate work done 
for public and private parties so little is ever seen 
by those outside who could best appreciate its ar- 
tistic merits. It is earnestly desired that a collec- 
tion of pictures of such work may be made, and 
as new issues of these books are made at least 
once a year, it affords an opportunity to the artists 
to place their work in a permanent form to be a 
source of interest to many readers and of pride 
to themselves. J, W. 



The Scotch Haggis. — We are Indebted to Mrs. 
Black, of the Glasgow School of Cookery, for the 
following, which may be considered an authentic 
recipe for the famous Caledonian dish : 

One sheep's pluck, a sheep's stomach, ^ lb. 
suet, I onion, yi lb. oatmeal, pepper and salt. 
Procure a sheeps pluck and stomach-bag ; wash 
the pluck well, and put it on in a pot to boil, 
allowing the windpipe to hang out of the pot so 



that any impurities will come out by it, boil 
gently from one and a half to two hours. Get 
the stomach bag nicely cleaned by the butcher ; 
wash It thoroughly in cold water and bring it to 
the boil, which will cause the bag to contract. 
Take it out of the pot immediately, wash and 
scrape it well, and lay it in the salt and water un- 
til needed. Mince the best part of the lungs and 
the heart, leaving o\|t all gristly parts ; grate the

best parts of the liver, and put all in a large basin. 
Toast well the oatmeal, and add It to the contents 
of the basin. Chop the suet very finely, add a 
middling-sized onion very finely chopped up, two 
teaspoonsful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper, a 
breakfast cup of the liquor in which the pluck 
was boiled, to moisten, and mix the whole. Now 
take up the stomach-bag, keep the fat or smooth 
side inside, and fill it up, but not quite full ; sew 
up the opening, and put it in boiling water to boil 
gently for three hours. Prick the haggis several 
times with a darning-needle to prevent it from 
sticking to the bottom of the pot. 



Wanted a Substitute.— A man in B— , Ills., 
said recently that he would pay me a hundred 
and fifty dollars if I could show him how to 
make ice cream without using cream that 
would be as good as real cream and that would 
beat up as well. He did not make the offer to 
me direct, but a young man from Iowa, a 
strong partizan of my books, who told him that 
he could get the information in the American 
Pastry Cook at a much lower price. The man 
of B — did. not want it that way, however, but 
wanted to pay a hundred and fifty dollars for 
some reason or other, and my young man ought 
to have been bolder, stayed with him, shown 
him how and collected the money on the spot, 
but he hesitated and referred the matter to me. 
Undoubtedly, the B — man is quite right. He is 
in the ice cream business, and the knowledge 
he seeks will be worth a hundred and fifty 
dollars, and he ought to pay it, and if he is a 
man of his word, after he has read this article 
and tried my directions, he may please send 
his hundred and fifty dollars right straight to 
the office, where I will duly acknowledge the 
receipt with the customary thanks and a hope 
to receive further favors. 

It will be supposed that a man, who is anx- 
ious to pay a hundred and fifty dollars for a 
substitute for cream, has no motive but to use 
a cheap imitation instead of the dearer genuine 
article, but as he is to pay me such a respect- 
able fee he shall be defended against such an 
imputation. He cannot get enough real cream 
for the requirements of his business; what he 
does get, is not uniformly good; some of it is 
just on the point of turning sour when it comes ; 
some, having been kept too long, has a flavor 
of mouldiness ; the larger portion is so thin that 
he can hardly tell it from new milk. This is 
always the way with the products of nature, 
they lack uniformity, they are subject to great 
variations of quality and appearance; on the 
other hand, the products of art are always un- 



der control of the artist, who can make them 
always alike or vary them at pleasure. Cooks 
can make artificial cream, therefore they are 
artists. The B — man wants to be an artist, and 
offers a hundred and fifty dollars. Besides that, 
to freeze real cream is the lazy man's way ; any- 
body can pour pure eream cold into the freezer 
(if they can only get the cream) with the requi- 
site amount of sugar and flavoring, and freeze 
it with such ease as to hardly miss the time ; 
but to make artificial cream requires one to be 
industrious, and industry is always praise- 
worthy ; the B — man wants to know the in- 
dustrious way, and says he will pay a hundred 
and fifty dollars, here it is: 

To make 4 gallons of artificial cream, which 
will be 6 gallons of ice cream after freezing, 
take 

4 gallons of new milk. 

7 pounds of granulated sugar. 

^ pound of corn starch. 

24 yolks of eggs. 

Set half the milk over the fire to boil with all 
the sugar in it. Mix the starch in a pan with a 
quart of the remaining cold milk, then drop in 
the raw yolks and beat to mix. When the milk 
on the fire boils, pour about a quart of it into 
the starch and egg mixture, then turn these 
into the boiling milk and at once remove the 
kettle from the fire, for the heat is sufficient to 
cook the starch and eggs. Add the cold milk 
and strain into the freezer. 

It is required that our artificial cream shall 
beat up as well as real cream, that is, become 
light and foamy, increase in volume and fill the 
freezer. This it will do perfectly, when only 
lightly cooked, as above directed. The boiling 
milk cooks the starch and half cooks the yolks 
so that they beat up by the motion of the 
freezer as light as sponge cake. But to beat up 
this or any other cream requires rapid motion. 
It is most perfect where the freezer is run by 
steam power, otherwise the old fashioned 
paddle should be used to finish, and when the 
artificial cream is so beaten up light, it cannot 
be known from real cream, that is from goou 
fresh cream that is neither sour or mouldy, and 
if the two are tried together it will generally 
receive the preference by the taste alone. If 
that is not enough, and something that will 
beat up better than cream be wanted, then take 
the whites of the eggs, beat them up stiff when 
the cream is nearly frozen and mix them in, 
and continue beating and freezing and the 
cream will raise the lid presently and foam all 
over. Please remit.

To be Tried. — It has been imparted to me as 
a secret worth knowing that a peculiarly deli- 
cious ice cream can be made of new milk which 
has rennet mixed with it, as if it were to be 
made into cheese, but it is not to be allowed to 
become thoroughly curdled. Somebody want- 
ing a specialty in ice cream should try it. 
Something about milk and rennet can be found 
in this book, in connection with English cheese 
cakes and cream curd puddings. 



About Prepared Almond Paste.— It is a pity 
to have to say it, but the ready-prepared almond 
paste, which can be bought in tin cans at about 
25 cents per pound and makes such delicious 
macaroons, almond icing and almond ice cream, 
has been unfavorably mentioned by the chem- 
ists as being adulterated with prussic acid, 
which is a poison. However, it is the same 
poisonous prussic acid which gives the flavor 
to such fruits as the peach, apricot, cherry 
and plum, its flavor is strongest in peach 
kernels, yet these are never known to injure 
anybody, the quantity of the drug being too 
small to have any hurtful effect; it is prussic 
acid which gives the bitter flavor to peach 
leaves, laurel leaves and the bay leaves, which 
are so much used for seasoning. Almond paste, 
if used at all, should be used sparingly and not 
with the excess which some pastry cooks 
practice because they find almond ice cream is 
a great favorite. Buyers of almond paste should 
deal only with reputable manufacturers. It is 
made, when genuine, of a mixture of sweet and 
bitter almonds, and is not hurtful, but cannot 
be so low-priced as an imitation flavored with 
drugs. 

To Use Almond Paste, shave it off the lump 
thinly, mix the shavings with granulated sugar 
and roll them together on the slab or table un- 
til the paste is thoroughly divided amongst the 
sugar, then use the sugar to make what is 
wanted. 



Another Plum Pudding. — This receipt makes 
one good-sized pudding: Take half a pound of 
breadcrumbs, half a pound of flour, half a pound 
of beef suet chopped very fine, two ounces of 
sweet almonds cut in fillets, one pound of cur- 
rants, one pound of raisins (stoned), eight 
ounces of lemon-peel cut in thin stripes, two 
ounces of citron-peel, four ounces of brown 
raw sugar, the zest and juice of one lemon ; mix 
well together with eight eggs and a wineglass 
of brandy; boil six hours, and hang up in the 
larder till required ; then boil up again for two 
or three hours — an hour or two will in no way 



injure a good plum-pudding — and always serve 
very hot, with brandy or rum sauce, as the case 
may be. 

Bakers' Cheap Cup Cakes. ' 

4 pounds butter. 

6 pounds sugar. 
32 eggs. 

2 quarts milk. 

2 quarts water. 

4 ounces ammonia. 

12 pounds flour, or enough to make dough a 
little thinner than pound cake. Mix like 
pound cake, adding the milk and water after 
the eggs, and flour and ammonia or powder 
last. Weigh off three-ounce cakes in small 
moulds. 



Bakers' Lady Fingers. 

I pound sugar. 
10 eggs. 

I pound flour. 
Beat the eggs (not separated) and the sugar 
together for half an hour, stir in the flour 
lightly. Directions for forming and baking 
will be found in this book. This is a harder, 
less delicate and more serviceable kind than 
the receipts in the following pages. 



Why these "Notes" are Written.— As fast 

as any new thing comes up or any old and well- 
known thing is newly found out to be specially 
good for hotel use, I try to get it into these 
books as new editions are being printed. The 
following letter will please some readers, and 
pleases me because it shows up what I have al- 
ways contended for, that it is better to have a 
few special good things that everybody likes 
than to have a hundred or thousand far-away, 
strange dishes that nobody appreciates; this 
friend wanted the one receipt for " Popovers " 
worse than he wanted the whole book besides, 
and expense is no object when a man wants a 
specialty. This receipt can be found in Cooking 
for Profit and in the new edition of the Family 
Cook Book, in one of which the man from Ohio 
had it and now it is in this volume, also. 

, Kans., Dec. 9, 1887.

one of your Pastry Cook books, to find out of 
what and how to make the so-called Popovers \

ding cup about 3 inches high, when baked they 
crack open and are hollow in centre and brown

Popovers, or German Puffs.— These puffs 
are among the culinary curiosities, as they have 
neither powder nor any other raising material 
in them, yet they rise high above the tops of 
the cups and become quite hollow — if not 
spoiled by too much flour. Good, rich milk 
should be used to make them. The batter may 
be kept an hour or two after mixing and little 
batches of puffs baked fresh as wanted, and the 
last will be as good as the first. 
2 eggs. 
I pint of milk — or 2 cups. 

10 ounces of flour — or two slightly rounded 
cups. 

Salt, a small teaspoonful. 

Break the eggs into a bowl, beat them light 
and keep adding the milk while beating. That 
takes about five minutes. Add the salt, then 
the flour all at once and beat it smooth like 
cream. 

Bake in cups or deep mufiin pans well but- 
tered, and only half fill them with the batter. 
Bake in a moderate oven about half an hour. 



from a loaf and serve with other kinds in the 
cake baskets. 



Scotch Slices. — This favorite kind of cake, 
and likewise " aniseed slices," " caraway slices" 
and other names given by different bakers, are 
all made of Scotch shortbread^ as follows : 

1 pound of flour. 
^ pound of butter. 
^ pound of sugar. 

2 eggs. 

Rub the butter into the flour, stir the eggs in 
the sugar until it is partly dissolved, mix all to- 
gether. It makes dough that can be rolled out 
and will be a trifle lighter for not being kneaded 
too much. 

To make Scotch or caraway slices, mix in a 
tablesp®onful or two of caraway seeds, for ani- 
seed slices use aniseed, for German slices use 
coriander seed. Roll the dough into a long roll, 
place on the baking pan and flatten it down to 
about an inch thick, bake with a dredging of 
sugar on top. When baked, cut off slices as 



L. E. B., Ogdensburg, writes: "Can you tell 
me what use to make of surplus yolks of eggs? 
You do not mention but one kind of cake made 
with yolks. I am employed in a fine bakery or 
confectionery, and some times have several quarts 
of yolks left over in a week and have to throw 
them away spoiled." 

Ans. If you were doing hotel work you would 
find, on the contrary, the whites would be left 
over, there being so many more uses for the 
yolks. The yolk contains all the richness of the 
eggs, and gives color, flavor and smoothness to 
puddings, cream custards and sweet sauces, better 
alone than with the whites mixed in. We use the 
yolks also in fish sauces, salad dressings, in potato 
and other croquettes, also minced for an orna- 
mental garnish, mixed with flour for "noodles" 
and with batter for another kind of soup, also 
thicken soups with them, instead of flour or 
starch, and steam yolks in bulk like a cake, then 
cut up and use them as we would chicken meat 
for patties. We rub cooked yolks through a sieve 
making a sort of vermicelli, to serve with some 
dish, and we drop them whole, also, into soup to 
substitute turtle eggs. We cut them up and mix 
with chicken meat, mushroons and sauce to fill 
the shells of fried bread with, and if there are any 
raw yolks left over after that, we mix them in the 
waffle batter. In a good bakery you will find 
nearly as many uses for this the best part of the 
tgg^ no matter how many may be left over, from 
your using the whites in meringues, macaroons, 
icing, etc., for the yolks may be mixed with water 
and used the same as whole eggs. Take a pint 
measure about two-thirds full of yolks, fill it up 
with water and you have a pint of eggs, which is 
a pound, or equal to ten eggs, and the mixture of 
yolks and water can be used in making almost 
any sort of cakes, the only difference observable 
being that they are yellower and richer than if 
whole eggs are employed. In this way you can 
utilize the yolks in all sorts of small cakes, in 
French coffee cakes, buns, rusks, tea-cakes, and 
in the sorts of sponge cakes and jelly rolls which 
are made light with powder instead of whipped 
whites. If you make ice creams, they alone — 
that is the fancy kinds — should use up all of that 
material you can have to spare, and another good 
purpose to put surplus egg-yolks to is to mix them 
with lemon or orange syrup and a little butter 
and stir the mixture over the fire until it thickens 
into a jam, very good to fill tartlets. If after that 
any yolks of eggs remain on hand, put them in 
the lemon and pumpkin pies.

The American Pastry (lo(m.Ai'<]:^.^ 



1. Angel Food, or "WTiite Sponge Cake. 

11 whites of eggs. 

10 ounces of fine granulated sugar — all that can 
be shaken and heaped on a cup. 

5 ounces of flour — a cup moderately heaped. 

2 rounded teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar. 

2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla or lemon extract. 

Get two pans together, put the cream of tartar 
into the flour and mix them by sifting out of one 
pan into the other six or seven times. 

Whip the whites firm enough to bear up an egg, 
put in the sugar, beat a few seconds, add the flav- 
oring, then stir in the flour lightly without beat- 
ing. When the flour is mixed in fairly out of sight 
it is finished. As soon as mixed put the cake in 
the oven. It needs'careful baking like a meringue 
in a slack oven and should stay in from 20 to 30 
minutes. A deep smooth mold with an unusually 
large tube is the best, but any other will do. The 
mold should not be greased, but when the cake is 
done turn it upside down, the tube or something 
else holding it up to let the air in, and leave it to 
get cold before trying to take it out. Then cover it 
with the plain sugar glaze of the next receipt. 

The rule for angel food in large quantities is a 
pound of sugar, a pound of whites, half a pound of 
flour and an ounce of cream tartar. 



Angel food, as this peculiarly white and light 
sponge cake is fancifully named has quite a history 
to be recorded. It originated in St. Louis a few years 
ago and is seen oftener in the hotel bills of fare of 
that city than anywhere else. 8. Sides, who kept 
a large cafe or restaurant there invented it and did 
not fail to make the most of his discovery, and it 
soon came into such great demand that not only 
was no fine party supper complete without it but 
it was shipped to distant cities, orders coming even 
from London. For some time the method of mak- 
ing it was kept a profound secret but at length the 
inventor yielded so far as to sell the receipt for 
twenty-five dollars, having it understood that it 
could not be made without a certain powder that 
could be obtained from him alone. It did not take 
long to discover that the powder was nothing but 
cream of tartar and the receipt once communicated 
gradually became common property. Many of the 
caterers for parties make a specialty of it, for it is 
still sufficientlv difficult to make always alike to 
prevent its becoming utterly common, and a con 
fiderable number of the cakes are sent out packed 



in boxes to surrounding towns, and occasionally to 
the east and south. The difficulty such as it is, 
that makes the caterers say this cake has been 
more trouble to them than anything else, and leads 
to the use of special molds to bake it in is the ten« 
dency to fall in at the centre after baking. The 
mold not being greased holds the cake up to its 
shape until cold. The lamb's-wool texture of it 
may be made finer by stirring after the flour is ad- 
ded. The cake will be better when a day o^d than 
when first baked, but to keep the outside from dry- 
ing and to make it better eatiog, as it has no rich- 
ness in its ingredients, it is always covered with a 
flavored sugar glaze or icing. It may have no di- 
rect connection with it, but Sides, who originated 
angel food, afterwards lost his reason and was 
taken to an insane asylum, his wife continuing the 
business he established. 



2. Pearl Glaze for Angel Food, etc. 

1 cupful of icing sugar. 

2 whites of eggs. 

2 teaspoonfuls of flavoring extract. 

Mix them together in a bowl. As soon as the 
sugar is fairly wetted it is ready but may be 
whitened by beating one minute. It dries pearl 
white; takes but a few minutes to prepare. Spread 
it over the bottom and sides of angel food. It also 
gives a rich transparent sort of eatable appearance 
to the top of a fine jelly cake, and shows up orna- 
ments of finished white icing finely. 

It does nearly as well with the sugar only slight- 
ly wetted with water instead of white of egg, when 
it is to be spread on pastry, as the sugar dries 
white. It can also be colored pink, or with choc- 
olate, or made yellow by mixing with yolk of egg. 



3. Eight-Egg Sponge Cake. 

1 pound of fine granulated sugar— 2 rounded 
cups. 

8 eggs. 

6 tablespoonfuls of water — small ^ cup. 

12 ounces of flour— 3 rounded cups. 

Separate the eggs, the white into a bowl, the 
yolks into the mixing pan. Put the water and 
sugar in with the yolks and beat them ten minutes, 
until they are a thick light batter. Have the flour 
ready. Whip the whites to a very firm froth, then 
mix the flour with the yolk mixture and stir the 
whites in last. Bake in molds either large or small

fingers.

largest baking pan, spread the cake only just thick 
enough to hide the paper, bake about six or eight 
minutes. Brush the paper over with water to get it 
off. Spread lemon or orange honey or red jelly on 
the cake and roll up.

Don't beat the white of eggs before mixing, but 
beat the whole mixture thoroughly after the flour is 
in. Then mix in the lemon juice and flavoring and 
last of all the milk. 



o. 



Delicate Cake. 



14 ounces of granulated sugar. 
12 ounces of butter, 
12 ounces of white of eggs. 
8 ounces of flour. 
8 ounces of corn starch. 
Juice of half a lemon. 
2 teaspoonfulls of flavoring extracts. 
^ cup of milk. 

1 bastingspoonful of brandy. 
Don't beat the whites to a froth, but cream the 
butter and sugar together, add the whites by por- 
tions, then the starch and flour, and after them the 
lemon juice, milk, flavorings and brandy. Beat all 
together well. 



7. Snow Oake. 

14 ounces of granulated sugar. 
12 ounces of white dairy butter. 
1 pound of white of eggs — about 18 whites. 
8 ounces of fine flour. 
10 ounces of corn starch. 
Juice of one lemon. 
I cupful of milk. 
Flavoring extracts. 
Little brandy. 

Don't beat the whites to a froth. Cream the 
butter and sugar together, add the whites a little at 
a time, then the starch and flour, after that the 
lemon juice, flavorings and milk. Beat well. 



8. 



Finest Chocolate Cake. 



Melt 4 ounces of common chocolate by merely 
warming it in a cup set on the side of the range. 

Make the snow cake mixture preceding, flavor it 
strongly with vanilla, and leave out the brandy. 
Pour in the melted chocolate and beat it in just be- 
fore the milk. 



O. 



Finest Wine Cake. 



Make the snow cake mixture and leave out the 
milk. Instead of it mix in at the last nearly a small 
teacupful of madeira wine, with enough either of 
red strawberry syrup or of drops of carmine to make 
the cake couleur de rose, but only pale blush or 
peach bloom, not any dull red or purples for cake. 
The lemon juice is very necessary here; it changes 
red to bright pink. 



lO. 



Marble Cake. 



Make either of the white cake mixtures, take out 
about half a cupful and color it light red with straw- 
berry or currant syrup. 

Butter a cake mould, flour it, and shake out the 
surplus flour, leaving the mould thinly coated. 
Drop lumps of cake batter in the mould with a tea- 
spoon, paint them over with a knife dipped in the 
red batter, but without flattening or smoothing or 
running the lumps together. Drop more spoonfuls 
of the cake mixture in the hollows and paint them 
over with the knife blade dipped in red as before, 
and so fill the mould to within an inch of the top. 
There will be fine waving lines of pink through the 
cake when cut. 

Chocolate and white can be used in the same w»y. 
The snow cake mixture is apt to be too soft to keep 
form by spoonfuls, unless quite cold. 

" Luck" is the poorest possible ingredient in cake 
making. The same cause will always produce the 
same effect. The exact proportions that will make 
a splendid cake one time will make the same every 
time if put together the same way. The questioa is 
only to find the right proportions.

Turkish Cake 



Fine chocolate cake with figs, almonds and 
raisins. The snow cake mixture will not bear up 
the fruit. Make the lady cake mixture, and add to 
it 4 ounces of chocolate melted by heat in a cup. 
Then prepare 

8 ounces of chopped figs. 

8 ounces of almonds blanched and split. 

8 ounces of seedless raisins. 

Flavor the prepared cake batter with vanilla and 
a little brandy. Dust the fruit with flour and stir it 



What makes us think the ladies cannot make deli- 
cate cakes, for sure, just when they want them is 
the exhibition they sometimes make at a church 
fair where everybody contributes cake with their 
names on. They look awful — like a cake hospital. 



18. 



Almond Cake. 



Make the lady cake mixture — the first receipt of 
this series — and add to it a pound of almonds 
blanched (scalded and peeled) and split. Also use 
almond extract and ro«e extract to flavor with. 
Dust the almonds with flour. The snow cake mix- 
ture would be too delicate to bear up the almonds. 



13. 



White Baisin Cake. 



Like the preceding, with a pound of sultan* 
seedless raisins instead of almonds, and flavor with 
lemon and extract of nutmegs. This is best baked 
in shallow pans in sheets; but of that more further 
on. 

And it is for these church fairs or other public 
festivals the dwellers in the world of private houses 
try to succeed and show their best, if ever, but they 
seem to always fail. 



14. 



Queen Cake 



Made with the lady cake mixture, No. 5, except 
the milk. 

1 pound of the greenest colored candied citron. 

i pound of almonds, blanched and split. 

i pound of sultana seedless raisins. 

I cup of sherry or maderia wine. 

The citron to be cut in fine shreds and floured to- 
gether with the almonds and raisins before mixing 
in. This mixture also makes small queen cakes, 
baked in little patty-pans, and these frosted on toj^j 
are among the finest possible. 

It is at these times they make the master of the 
house buy a cord of hickory wood and hire a man to 
saw it, because it makes such a nice steady heat to 
bake a cake with; and they send a boy on a horse 



to a friend's in the country to get some "'* right 
fresh eggs," because there are none in the whole 
town good enough. Then they have Julia to dry 
the flour, and IJetsey to wash and pound the butter, 
and Susan and her little sister to beat the eggs, and 
it is bad for the poor cat if she gets in the way. 
We fellows who live in bakeries don't positively 
know that these things take place, but have picked 
up such impressions someway. But we do know 
how the cakes look when they get to the fair. 



15. 



Hickory Nut Cake, 



8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of whites of eggs (9 whites.) 

^ cupful of milk. 

1 rounded teaspoonful of baking powder. 

1 pound c f flour. 
12 ounces of hickory nut kernels. 

Don't beat the whites to a froth. Warm the but- 
ter and sugar together and rub them to a cream the 
usual way, then add the eggs, then milk, powder, 
and the flour. When well mixed stir in the hickory 
nuts. Flavorings may be added at option. If 
brandy be used the baking powder should be left 
out. 

1«. 

There is one cake marked "presented by Mrs. A.* 
It rose one-sided. The top cracked all over, looked 
like all splits and gullies, and in the high side a 
crater opened and the lava kept rising and running 
and never would get cooked and stop, though all the 
rest of the cake was done hard long ago, and began 
to smell unpleasantly. That cake was poor, had 
too little butter and too much eggs, milk and flour, 
and probably was not put into bake for some hours 
after the batter was mixed. There is another 
"presented by Miss B.'' It rose and rose, flat- 
topped and even, but never got above the edge of 
the cake mould. It leaked over the top and hung 
in strings, and fell on the stove bottom and made a 
smell, and when it got tired of that it just sunk 
down and down again. That had too much sugar. 



17, 



Dream Cake. 



In a city that we know of there is an entire 
side of a building in a fashionable neighborhood 
painted in large letters with the words "celebrated 
dream cake." Evidently it was the aim to rival 
the fame of "angel food," and this is certainly 
better eating, although scarcely so extremely 
W'hite. 

1 pound of granulated sugar — 2 cups, 
y, pound of butter — 1 cup. 

12 whites of eggs — \%, cup. 
Yz pint of milk — 1 cup. 

2 rounded teaspoons baking powdef 



10 



THE AMERIOAxN x-^ASTRY COOK. 



1 rounded teaspoon cream tartar. 

Vanilla or lemon extract. 

1 pound good weight of flour — 4 cups. 

Sift the flour, powder and cream tartar together 
three or four times over. 

Soften the butter and stir it and the sugar to- 
gether until white and creamy, gradually stir in 
the milk, tepid, and a handful of flour to keep 
them from separating. Whip the whites to froth, 
and add part whites and part flour until all are in, 
and flavoring extract at same time. Bake either 
in cake moulds or shallow pans and frost over 
when done. 



Kossuth Cakes. 



Make sponge drops large and thick, hollow out 
the bottoms, put in whipped cream or pastry 
cream, place two together and with a fork dip 
them in melted sweet chocolate or chocolate icing

Havana Cream Cake. 



18. 



Ordinary White vake. 



1 pound of sugar. 
8 ounces of butter, melted. 
10 whites of eggs. 

1 cupful of milk. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder, 
li^ pounds of flour. 

Beat the sugar, melted butter and white* all to- 
gether a minute or two, add the milk, powder, flour 
and flavor. 

Now, if we had to make cakes in some place 
where people took notice and made remarks and 
said we did not know much about making good 
things in hotels nohow, and if they couldn't do 
better they would sell out, we should want to make 
the snow cake as beautiful and white as cotton bat- 
ting, bake it thin in jelly cake pans, spread some of 
the richest confections between the cakes, and ice 
the top, having the cake and the icing so near alike 
in whiteness as to be hardly distinguishable apart. 



19. 



Pistachio Creazn Cake. 



8 ounces of pistachio nuts, blanched and chopped. 
8 ounces of sugar, 
i cupful of water. 

2 ounces of butter. 
Whites of four eggs. 

Green juice from pounded spinach leaves for color- 
ing. 

3 jelly cake sheets of snow cake. 

Boil the sugar and water to thick syrup, throw in 
the butter, then the pistachio nuts, boil five 
minutes; then stir in the white of eggs and take it 
off when they thicken. Color it a little deeper than 
pistachio green. Spread this when cold between 
the three sheets of cake. 



8 ounces of fresh grated cocoanut. 

1 pound of sugar. 
4 large oranges. 

2 lemons. 

4 ounces of butter. 

6 yolks and 2 whole eggs. 

Grate the rinds and squeeze the juice of the 
oranges and lemons into the sugar and bring it to a 
boil, making a flavored syrup. Throw in the but- 
ter, then the cocoanut, and boil 5 minutes. Stir in 
the eggs and cook slowly till thick. Spread between 
layers of snow cake. 

Then they are strange the way they exclaim when 
they burn up a cake in the stove. Once we heard 
a lady sing, "Gee woicks gee whilikens, the dor- 
drotted thing's gone blackernaniggerbaby !" That 
was at the toll house at Shippingsport near Louis- 
ville, as we were going through the locks twenty- 
seven years ago last anniversary, and anybody could 
know it was a cake burnt up by the black smell that 
came across the canal. Now one of us fellows 
would only have remarked dam kind of quietly and 
lighted our pipe. In fact, you have to bake these 
white cake sheets with scarcely any color at all to 
look well with colored creams between and ichig on 
top. 



SI. 



Glazed Cakes. 



We use the term for cakes glazed over with boiled 
icings of different colors to make a distinction from 
the usual iced or frosted cakes with raw sugar 
icing. All the richness of cream candy bon-bons 
belongs to these; they are better to cut, better to 
look at and better to eat than the common, and 
after a very little practice are quicker made and dry 
immediately. 

22, Yellow Glaze or Boiled Icings. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

i teacupful of water. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

Flavoring extracts. 

Boil the sugar and water, without stirring, for 6 
minutes or more, or till a drop of the syrup in coid 
water sets so that it can hardly be flattened between 
the finger and thumb. A deep bowl-shaped sauce- 
pan holding one quart should be used. Have the 
yolks slightly beaten ready in a bowl. Pour the 
bubbling syrup to the yolks quickly while you 
rapidly beat them with an egg beater. Return to 
the fire and keep stirring while it cooks a minute or 
two. It will then do to pour on sheets of cake and 
jf the syrup was at the right point it will set hard 
and dry as soon as cold. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



11 



But it is better to finish by beating the glaze 
rapidly while it is cooling, and add the flavoring 
just as it becomes too thick to beat. 

The above is the easiest of the kind to make, as it 
does not make so much difference what point the 
syrup is boiled to — it will dry on the cakes anyway. 



23. White Glaze or Boiled Icing:. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

^ teacupful of water. 

4 whites of eggs. 

Flavoring extracts. 

Boil the sugar and water to a point thicker than 
for the yellow glaze, or till the drop in cold water 
sets hard and brittle. After the first mixing of the 
sugar and water these syrups should never be 
stirred — makes them turn to sugar. Don't beat the 
whites any more than enough to mix them. Pour 
the bubbling syrup to the whites, beating all the 
while. Set on the fire again and beat for a minute 
or two while it. cooks. It is extremely liable to 
burn on the bottom. 

Then set the saucepan in a pan of ice-water, and 
beat the icing with a Dover egg beater till it becomes 
thick. It will be of a dazzling whiteness at last. 
Can be flavored to suit the fancy. If boiled to right 
point sets hard as soon as spread or poured over the 
cake. 



IS4. Rose Glaze or Boiled Icing'. 

Make the white glaze and color and flavor to suit, 
just as it begins to be so thick as to be hard to beat. 



35. Chocolate Glaze or Boiled Icing:. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

.^ teacupful of water. 
• 3 ounces of grated chocolate. — the common sort. 

4 whole eggs. 

Vanilla flavoring extract. 

Boil the sugar and water together in a deep sauce- 
pan for five minutes, add the chocolate. 

When a drop in cold water sets hard almost as 
candy stir in the eggs rapidly, beating all the while* 
Let cook about five minutes more with constant 
stirring. Flavor with vanilla. Beat more or less 
while it is cooling. Spread or pour it over sheets of 
cake. 

The confectioners, too, like us to make these 
glaze cakes for their windows and show cases; they 
take pleasure when the cake is as white as the icing, 
and red jelly between the layers, in putting them in 
the front rank. Having 3 or 4 different kinds of 
glaze and sheets of the whitest cakes only about a 
third of an inch thick to cover with them you can 
cut them when set in squares or diamonds and 
triangles, red, white, yellow and chocolate, and they 



make a very pretty stack. Besides, small cakes, 
such as sponge drops, can be dipped in the icings 
while hot and another assortment made, just the 
thing for ornamental baskets and pyramids. 



SO. Chocolate Glaze without Eggs. 

1 pound of sugar. 

i teacupful of water. 

4 ounces of common chocolate, grated. 

Poil all together almost to candy point, flavor 
with vanilla when partly cooled, beat a short time, 
spread over the cake. 

Colored syruj- of fruit juice and sugar boiled 
down thick enc „gh to bubble and rise in the sauce- 
pan can be used instead of icings to cover cake with 
a glassy surface.

Items about Puff Paste. 



When puff-paste has been rolled out and folded 
up again 4 times it lies just like 2 quires of tissue 
paper piled alternately a yellow sheet with a white 
sheet — a sheet of butter and a sheet of paste, all of 
the same evenness and regularity from bottom to top. 
It is hard to get butter and dough to lie so equally, 
but that is what has to be tried for, and we have to 
show how to make them come so. If baked then 
the sheets of paste or dough would be as sharp as knife 
blades, and might cut the mouth of the rash person 
who should try to eat them, the butter having all run 
out into the baking pan. One more rolling and 
folding makes the layers two-thirds thinner, and 
eatable, and another rolling after that makes the 
layers thin enotigh to be blown away with the 
breath. 

The reason of these unfinished sheets of paste be- 
ing so sharp edged and continuous, is, there is no 
shortening rubbed into the flour when fine puff- 
paste is wanted — the layers of dough are nothing 
but flour and water. Rubbing part or all of the 
butter or lard into the flour dry makes short-paste, 
but not the marvellous, flaky, high-flying puff paste. 
Those who get their first instructions in home places 
never want to believe that. 

Some people say it is a matter of light touch, a 
peculiar temperament, a something inherited that 
makes certain individuals always and easily suc- 
cesses at making puff-paste and others always fail- 
ures. They say women make better paste than men. 
There is no grounds for such a distinction. The 
probability is, it is a matter of sense and study, of 
head work more than hand work. A giddy person 
does not make fine paste, but is is not their hand 
that's giddy, it's their head. It is cause and effect 
again, and some cannot see their relation. Some 
people cannot place rolls in straight rows in the pan, 
nor lay strips on pies diamond-wise.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



It makes all the difference when a fresh cub comes 
in the kitchen to be pastry cook's boy, if he has 
been one of those young ones that stand with their 
chin on the kitchen table seeing their mother make 
pies. 

The others are amusing green and awkward. 
They will pour a pint of water into a big pan of flour 
and then go feeling around for the lumps it makes, 
and pick them out one by one. They could not 
work the lump of dough they get that way without 
a sledge hammer, and pie dough has to be about as 
soft as mush. The way is to pour the water in a 
hole made in the middle of the flour, and gently stir 
it round with two fingers till it has gathered in flour 
enough so it can be lifted out of the pan on to the 
table, there to be worked smooth and fit to roll out. 

The best puff-pa^te is that made in 10, 15 or 20 
minutes, according to the quantity, when one has no 
time to spare for packing it between pans of pounded 
ice, or for other foolishness, when the butter has 
been worked smooth and pliable beforehand, and 
lies ready in a pan of ice-water — when the ice-water 
stands ready to mix with, the flour is cold and the 
oven is hot and waiting — then you turn out paste 
that puffs and rises high and dry and wholesome. 
The reason is the ingredients don't have time to get 
warm and soggy, and there is an immense amount 
of labor and trouble saved over the ice packing way. 
Still, of course, the same method is not practicable 
in every place. 

When the plain, soft flour and water dougn nas 
been rolled out as if for cutting biscuits out of, but 
instead is covered all over with the required amount 
of butter in lumps, and then the dough is folded 
over it, the ^rsential thing and the only difficult one 
is to get the dough and butter to roll out again and 
again at even pace. Soft butter will give way under 
the rolling-pin and leave its place, burst through, or 
out at the ends. It is of no use trying with really 
soft butter, but when it is of medium firmness the 
dough may be mixed very soft to match it, and good 
paste may be made. With the flour and water ex- 
tremely cold, the butter often hardens in the paste 
instead of softening — that is success, whether done 
in one or two hours in an ice-chest or in ten minutes 
on a cold table. There is another difficulty in the 
way of even distribution — the more the dou^h is 
worked and rolled the tougher it beomes and 
springs back, while the butter does not. To over- 
come that, the paste is allowed to rest awhile after 
about three rollings, but it is better in warm 
weather to get along without such an interval, by 
not kneading the dough at all, and having it soft 
enough at the start. The experienced workman 
goes through a certain routine every day that meets 
all exigencies, and his work is always alike, while 
others talk about the luck and havinr? *^ light hand 
for fine paste. 



They make a great fuss — the people who make 
verses do — about the beauties of milking the cows; 
as if there were no flies and cows didn't kick ! It is 
much more charming to be working the butter. We 
have seen them at summer resort houses. They go 
where the spring water runs cold, and work the 
lump of butter in a trough till it is just perfection 
to make pufl" paste with — though no dairy maid ever 
will let her fresh lump of butter go for such a pur- 
pose. We have to work the butter as well as the 
time allowable in the crowded forenoon permits by 
pounding it in a wooden bowl with a potato masher 
Cold butter that is not so broken and made pliable 
is as bad as warm, for it will not be pressed out by 
rolling, but cuts its way through in lumps every- 
where. 

We have another newer and entirely different 
way of making fine leaf paste, but like this common 
way the best for meeting all the varied requirements 
of hotel work, and this is the formula. 



38, 



Puflf Paste. 



1 pint of water (2 coffeecupfuls.) 

Flour — all the water will take up. 

Butter — from \\ to 2 pounds. 

Mix the flour and water to soft dough. Roll it 
out about an inch thick. Take half the butter and 
drop it in lumps the size of eggs upon the sheet of 
dough, the width of two fingers between each lump. 
Sift a little flour over, press the butter into the 
dough slightly, then fold the dough over in three. 
Roll out to the same thickness as before, distribute 
the remaining half of the butter over it, dredge, and 
fold over in three again, and count that one fold — 
the former folding with only half the butter in counts 
nothing, or "half a turn." Always keep the dough 
rolled out to square shape and turn the broad side 
towards you after folding. Roll and fold till you 
have counted 6 times. Use plenty of flour under 
and over until the last rolling wlien the surplus 
should be swept off. It is then ready for use. 
39. 

After a few trials neither butter nor flour need be 
weighed — the rule of butter size of an egg two 
fingers apart is all that is wanted, and the amount 
to be made can be governed by the cups or dippers 
of water used.

Lard for Puff-Paste. 



Then there is the question of expense. They hate 
to furnish first-rate butter enough to make good 
puff"-ppste; people are fond of pies and pastries, and 
it costs like sixty. There is little use in making 
paste as rich as it can be made anyway, except when 
it is for fancy articles — the tall puff'ed up edges of 
pies are oftenest thrown away with all their fine 
butter in them — only because people cannot eat 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



18 



everything, and the middle of the pie goes first. 
Butter that is only just a little off does well enough* 
but butter that is bad spoils the whole article, filling 
and all, clear through. Good lard is far better than 
poor butter to make good eatable white and light 
pastry, and some sorts will make just as tall puff- 
paste as butter will. Oily and grainy lard will not ; 
it has to be the firm, tough tenacious kind of dried 
out lard. The very best everyday kind of paste is 
made with half butter and half good firm lard. 
Then a little salt must be strewn over the lumps of 
laid after they are spread on the dough. Butter 
alone carries salt enough. 



31. 



Compressed Lard. 



The most wonderfully light and tall puff-paste, 
that beat butter pastry all hollow, used to be made 
in the times when lard oil was used in immense 
quantities before kerosene came in, of the stearine 
lard, the residue left after pressing out the oil. This 
was as hard as tallow, but of a different texture. 
Oil is the greatest enemy to puff-paste, and stearine 
contains none. Then we had vol-au vents that a 
small goose could be hid in, that rose several inches 
high of their own lightness. 

It looks like the sweet fresh suet that comes in so 
plentifully with the fat loins of beef ought to be 
better far pastry than strong butter and miserable 
oily lard, and so it is, and comes next to the stearine 
lard mentioned above, but can only be used after 
going through a particular process. People try to 
use melted suet or tallow or drippings, and they 
mince raw suet and then pound it fine, but however 
good short paste these may make they will not pro- 
duce puff-paste. The suet or tallow is always com- 
posed of hard grains that cut through and destroy 
the flakes. The proper process is something of a 
trade secret; a good thing for those who work for 
themselves to save butter by. 



33. 



To Prepare Suet for Making: 
Puff-Paste. 



Cut the suet very small, leaving out all dark meat 
stained pieces, and set on the side of the range in a 
boiler with plenty of hot water. The suet must not 
boil but steep in scalding water for a few hours. 
Then pour water and all into a large strainer with a 
bottom of perforated tin — a gravy strainer — and rub 
the fat through with a potato masher. Get a pan 
of broken ice and water and a little salt in it, and 
dip the strained fat by ladlefuls into it, stirring the 
ice about at the same time. The fat sets instantly 
on falling into the cold water in crumbs like meal. 
Gather it by straining, press it together and pound it 
with a masher in a bowl as you would butter. Salt 
it for use. 



Some years ago — about the close of the war — the 
writer had a friendly contention with a fine cook 
who made splendid pastry, as to whether as fine puff 
paste could not be made by the old-fashioned way 
just explained, as by this following. It was finally 
decided, after both ways had been tested to the ut- 
most, that there was no difference in the results, but 
there are certain every-day work considerations in 
favor of the old way. The leaf paste is fine for 
fancy tarts. The workman who would be perfect in 
his trade will practice both. It's bad to have a fel- 
low come along and beat you. 



33., French Puff Paste or Feuilletage. 

It is requisite to have the butter very firm and 
free from water, and those who wish to have very 
superior pastry will use the very finest flour. 

Weigh your butter and flour in equal proportions, 
cut the butter into thin slices, take a little flour and 
roll it with a slice of butter into flakes, proceed thus 
until all the butter and flour are rolled together; 
gather the flakes into a heap, and sprinkle them 
with water, about a gill and a half is required for a 
pound of paste. Make into a smooth paste with the 
hand, and then roll it out to the thickness of half an 
inch. If a pound of paste, divide it into four parts, 
flour the board and roll out each part as thin as a 
wafer, fold over four or five times, and use as re- 
quired. Bake as soon as possible. 

Then try this, and hold fast that which you suc- 
ceed with the best. 



34. 



Pine Leaf Paste. Ten-Minute 
Paste, 



1 pound of cold butter. 

1 pound of cold flour. 

i pint of ice-water — a coffecupful. 

Cut the butter into pieces size of walnuts and put 
them in a vessel containing broken ice and water 
some time before using, to become very hard and 
cold. 

Sift the flour into a pan and lay aside a handful 
to dust with. Throw in the lumps of butter, mix 
them with the dry flour, pour in the ice water and 
shake altogether, merely getting the flour dampened 
and stuck to the lumps of butter, without kneading 
or pressing. Scrape out the contents of the pan on 
to the table well floured, press it up together and 
then roll it out with all the force necessary to break 
the lumps of butter, and spread all out to a thin 
sheet. Now loosen it from the table with the 
palette knife and roll it up like a roly-poly pudding, 
and count 1. Roll it out again to half an inch, fold 
over in three like ordinary paste and count 2, and so 
roll and fold in three till you have connted 6 fold- 
ings. But when half done it should have an inter- 
val of 5 or 10 minutes to stand in a cold place and 
lose its elasticity.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



35. Lemon Fie. Best Hotel Kind. 

1 pound of white sugar. 
6 lemons. 

1 quart of water or milk. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 

15 yolks of eggs —or 8 whole eggs. 

1 ounce of butter. 

Put the sugar in a saucepan, grate in the lemo'^ 
rinds — the yellow only — and squeeze in the juice 
without the bitter seeds. Pour in the water and set 
the saucepan on to boil. Mix the 2 tablespoonfuls 
of starch with a little cold water, pour it into the 
saucepan when the syrup is boiling and immediately 
take it off the fire. Then mix in the yolks slightly 
beaten — and the butter. They are not to be cooked 
in it. Bake in pie pans lined with puff-paste rolled 
out thin. Sift powdered sugar over the pies when 
done, or else meringue over with the white of eggs 
and sugar. 

Can one advocate simplicity and short bills of fare 
and a few things well cooked, and then give six 
ways of making lemon pies and other things similar? 
Yes. Not for one person to make the same thing 
six ways so much as for six persons to pick out the 
method that suits their particular circumstances and 
style of table they cook for. And as with pie mix- 
ture so with many other things in this book. For 
the cheapest covered lemon pie of the great baker- 
ies see No. 263. 



36. 



Club House Lemon Pie. 



20 ounces of sugar. 

9 large lemons. 

1 J pints of rich cream. 
18 yolks of eggs. 

6 whites. 

Place the sugar in a large bowl and grate the 
lemon rinds into it, using a tin grater, and then 
squeeze in the juice. Beat the yolks of eggs light 
and mix the cream with them; pour this to the 
lemon and sugar, and just before filling the pie 
crusts with the mixture whip the 6 whites to a froth 
and stir them in, No meringue needed for this rich 
acid kind. 



3T, 



Lemon Pie. Southern. 



2 pounds of sugar. 

1 pint of water. 
9 lemons. 

2 ounces of butter. 
12 eggs. 

Cut 3 of the lemons in thin slices and keep them to 
strew in the pies when filled. Grate the others into 
the sugar, squeeze in the juice, add water, make the 
mixture hot to draw the lemon flavor, then mix in 
the eggs well beaten. Let the lemon slices float in 
the pies; bake, and sift powdered sugar over when 
done. 



38. Lemon Butter Pie or Tart. 
Kichest. 

1 pound of sugar. 

5 lemons. 

4 ounces of'butter. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

1 whole egg. 

Make a boiling lemon syrup of the sugar, grated 
rinds and juice of the lemons — no water needed — 
and throw in the butter. When that is melted stir 
in the eggs. Let simmer on the range about 10 
minutes. 

Make the pies small, the paste rolled very thin, 
and bake dry. 



39. Lemon Butter. Baker's Way. 

Good for pies, jelly cakes, tarts, turnovers, etc. 

5 or six lemons. 

1 pound of sugar. 

1 cupful of water. 

2 ounces of butter. 
2 ounces of flour. 

6 eggs. 

Set the water on to boil with the grated lemon 
rinds and juice in it, and the butter. Mix flour and 
sugar together dry, beat them in the boiling liquor 
then add the eggs and stir over the fire 10 minutes. 



40. 



Lemon Tarts without Fruit. 



6 ounces of bread or cracker crumbs. 
1 quart of water. 
1 pound of sugar. 

1 rounded teaspoonful of tartaric acid. 

2 tablespoonfuls of lemon extract. 
5 eggs or ten yolks for richer color. 

Mix all the ingredients together cold. The imita- 
tion of lemon mixture is very close, and the pie is 
better than the real that is sometimes made with 
green and bitter lemons. 



41. Peach Flan. 

Said to have been for a few years a specialty, in 
the peach season, at a large hotel at Put-in-Bay, 
since burned down. 

Cover a shallow baking-pan with bottom crust of 
good pie paste, nearly cover that with quartered 
peaches — in the same style as bakers' apple cake — 
then fill up with custard made the same as fer cus- 
tard pie and bake slowly. Cut in squares when 
done and serve instead of pudding. It is necess- 
ary to place the pan in the oven before filling and 
add the custard by means of a long handled dipper. 
When they are soft, ripe peaches they need no 
previous cooking, but if hard must be stewed firet

4S. Imitation Lemon Pie. Aoid Pie. 



6 ounces of bread or cracker crumbs. 
1 quart of wafer. 
1 pound of sugar. 

1 rounded teaspoonful of tartaric acid, 

2 tablespoon sful of lemon extract. 
5 eggs, or 10 yolks for richer color, 

Miz all the ingredients together cold. The imita- 
tion of lemon mixture is very close and the pie is

It is not everyone that calls himself a pastry cook 
can turn out hotel pies artistically, and however 
much the casual reader who thinks of pie only as 
something to eat may be amused at the idea we as- 
sure him there are possibilities of taking high posi- 
tion among the «"ther things of beauty on the weal 
thy table for the hotel pie which do not exist for the 
private house pie, or the baker's pie, or if they do 
are so remote it will take ages of domestic pie cul- 
ture to bring them in sight. The experienced hotel 
steward knows now instantly when he has secured 
a fully developed hotel or fine steamboat pie maker. 
Your baker trained to work for the hungry pie eater 
rather than for the luxurious admirers of beaut ifu 
pies covers every pie with a top crust, which is the 
first sign, but the great sign of his standing is Eet 
up when he takes both hands and cuts off the past. 
ry by pressing against the edge of the plate, whirl, 
ing the pie round at the same time. Why should 
he make or wish to make fine leaf paste to press and 
mash in that way? But your first-class pastry cook 
having made his paste so that the flakes will rise 
and open as distinct and separate as the leaves of a 
rose and of a thinness more impalpable than tha^, 
no matter how rapidly he may work, will roll even- 
ly, throw it on the pie pan lightly, shake it down to 
place with a little jar upon the table, take it up on 
the fingers of the left hand and cut around with a 
sharp knife, not leaving the least sign of pressure, 
finger mark or drag or tear about it. These pies 
though having tall flake-piled edges are pretty sure 
to be almost as dry and free from grease as flaby 
biscuits and quite wholesome both to eat and to see. 
If people say that hotel pies are not so we reply that 
it is because the pastry art is somewhat difficult and 
there are few masters of it, the begirjners are slow t > 
get hold of the fi le touches and the hotels are ful^ 
of half taught beginners. We don't know anything 
about the private houses, and these remarks make 
no invidious reflections upon the household pie. 
With both bottom and top crust rolled thin and 
powdered sugar on top it is good. But the hotel pie 
contemplates life from a different stand point and 
like all the products of high art it is somewhat aris- 



tocratic. Literature is cheap and common — you can 
buy a rare classic for ten cents — the best thoughts 
of the best writers for a nickel — imitations not to be 
detected of the rarest gems for a dollar or two— but 
the ideal hotel pie is only for the few. 



So careful and tender is the good workman of his 
leaf paste that he slants the knife outwards when 
cutting that the paste may be wide and make a 
broad edge; and that broad edge he notches with a 
sharp knife in the places where the pie is to be 
divided, lest with a rude 'pressure somebody will 
crush and spoil the flakes in cutting the pie after it 
is baked. 



Greatest country, tallest mountains, longest rivers, 
biggest pies. 

43. Meringue for Lemon ?ies. 



The secret of making the meringue or frosting 
stand tall and thick on the pies is in the baking. 
Whip the whites of eggs to a froth that will not fall 
out of the bowl or pail when turned upside down, 
put in about a tablespoon ful of granulated sugar for 
each white, stir very little, spread it on the pies 
when they are just done and still baking hot with- 
out taking them out of the oven, and let them bake 
with the door open. If made hot enough to brown 
the meringue will surely fall and become worse than 
nothing. 5 to 10 minutes is enough to bake the 
meringue dry and straw-colored. Sift granulated 
sugar on top of the meringue as soon as spread, be- 
fore baking, to form a rich appearing crust for vari- 
ety.

Make a common plain custard of 1 quart of milk, 
6 or 8 eggs and 6 ounces of sugar, then mix in 8 to 
12 ounces of grated cocoanut. Bake in crusts. 



45. Oocoanut Pie. Hotel Ordinary, 



1 quart of milk. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
1 ounce of butter. 

8 ounces of grated cocoanut. 

6 eggs. 

Boil the milk, mix the starch in the sugar dry 
and stir them in and the butter and cocoanut, and 
then take the mixture from the fire. Sdr in the 
eggs after it has cooled a little. The eggs should be 
beaten quite light first. Sift powdered sugar over 
the pies after baking. 



For cocoanut meringue pie make the preceding 
mixture with 12 yolks of eggs and take the whites 
to beat up for the meringue. Strew cocoanut on 
top before baking.

White Oocoanut Pie. 



The same mixture as the above made very deli- 
cate and enow white by letiing it become cold and 
then stirring in instead of yolks 12 or 14 whites of 
eggs whipped to a froth, and a slight flavoring of 
rose and oiange. Sift powdered buzbt over when 
done Good to fill in pnste lined patty pans for

Orange Pie. 



Generally made with the object of using up a sur- 
plus of perishable fruit. 

Peel half the number of oranges required. With 
a very sharp knife slice them across the core, throw 
out the seeds, lay the slices over the bottoms of 
paste-lined pie pans alternately with slices of un- 
peeled oranges. Strew sugar over and pour over 
that a cooking spoonful of red wine. Bake slowly 
till the juice is become thick eyrup. 



Cocoanut and leraou juice may be mixed with or 
strewn over the above. Orang^i pi. s can be made 
by the lemon pie receipis, a? d wish part lemons.

Orange Butter Pie. 



8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of best fresh butter. 

9 eggs. 

2 oranges. 

Grate the rinds and squeeze the juice of the OTan- 
ges into the sugar in a deep saucepan, put in the 
butter and then the eggs slightly beaten. Set the 
mixture over the fire and stir it till it becomes thick 
and ropy, like melted cheese. It may lessen the 
trouble, and danger of burning on the bottom to set 
it in a large saucepan containing boiling water. 
When done beat the mixture with an egg whisk a 
few minutes. The cooking of this mixture causes it 
to remain light and thick and rounded in the pies 
or tarts after baking, instead of filling and becom- 
ing wixy as it o'herwise would do. Bake in a very 
Sfow oven or with a pan on the shelf above to ward 
off the hei\t. 

40. Orange Dariole Filling. Richest. 

Requires deep pans for baking in as it flows over 
ordinary rims 
1 pound of sugar. 
8 ounces of butter. 
4 oranges. 

10 eggs. 

Grate and squeeze the oranges into the sugs.r, add 
the butter and eggs and cook the mixture thiik over 



the fire with constant stirring. Let it cool and then 

beat it ligtit before ling the crusts. 



And yet some worthy hopefuls having seen pio 
edges stand two inches high in distinct flakes while 
weighing next to nothing, will do their brave en- 
deavors too, and lay a double edge on theirs, ma- 
king a band of paste to place on the rim of the plate 
first, washed with egg, and the proper pie crust laid 
on lop. That is all wrong. We told them they 
could not make our hotel pies. For if the airiest 
crust that can be laid on a pie edge will hardly be 
Citen is it not folly to double the weight and sub- 
stance? Puff-paste perfectly made will rise high 
enough from one layer only from an eighth to a 
quarter inch thick. If it will not then it will not 
when doubled in thickness. And, besides, how 
much valuable time is wasted from better work, 
putting a useless double edge on the pies. 



50. 



Apple Cream Pie. 



Marlborough Pudding or Pie. 



1 pint of stewed jypples. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

1 cupful of milk. 

4 ounces of butter. 

4 eggs. 

Little sherry wine and nutmeg. 

Mix all together. Bake in crusts. 



51, Apple Custard Pie or Pudding. 



1 quart of dry stewed apples. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

3 ounces of butter. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

Juice and rind of 1 lemon and nutmeg. 

The apples should be stewed with as little water 
as possible with the steam shut in. Mash them 
through a strainer. Cook the pulp over the fire 
with the sugar and butter in and then add the beat- 
en yolks and flavor. Bake in crusts. 



And where it is so requisite to have the fine flakes 
of puff-paste lie straight and undisturbed care must 
be taken in handling the small portions when roll- 
ing out pie crusts. Green people always will take 
the trimmings of the last pie and work and kuead 
and pound and press Jit to death. You musn't do 
that. Lay the scraps in layers in a pile loose on 
each other. Cut a chunk square and small from the 
large piect of paste and lay it on top of the scraps, 
then roll out to a quarter inch thickness. Now you 
don't want the bottom crust of the pie to be so thick 
as that — nobody wants to eat so much soggy under 
crust — but you do want that thickness for the edge. 
So double the sheet of paste over on itself in half. 



THE A3Sfl:EKICAN PASTRY COOK.

and with the end of the rolling pin roll that part 
that will be the middle of the pie to half the thick- 
ness. You will of crurse have flour enough about 
it to prevent sticking together. Then open out the 
doubled sheet again and you have a hollow thinbot = 
tomed sheet of pa te just ready to fit the pie pan 
and with a thick edge lo hold in the custards and 
lemon mixtures. 



53. 



Apple Pies. 



1. Pare the apples and slice them oflF the cores in- 
to a bright pan or brass kettle. To every pound al- 
low on an average a quarter pound of white sugar 
and a cupful of water. Throw in 6 cloves or some 
lemon peel for flavor, shut wi h a tight lid and le; 
stew slowly in the steam. M^sh through a colan 
der. Bike in open pies. Apfles of poor qua'ity 
that turn blue in cooking are often improved by the 
addition of the juice of a lemon. 

2. Apples cored and quartered and stewed in fla 
vored syrup like preserves without breaking may be 
filled into shell pies or vol au vents baked sepai-ately, 
as explained further on. For every pound of the 
apple quarters allow 6 ounces of sugar and half cup 
of water with cloves and lemon peel. Let the syr- 
up boil first, throw in the apple quarters and shut 
in the steam. Simmer half an hour without stirring 
them. 

3. Early green apples. Wash and steam them 
whole. Mash through a colander, aid sugar, but- 
ter and cinnamoi or nutmeg. Bake with a top 
crust. Powd red f-ugar over when done. 

4. Sliced apple pie. Use this way only the best 
ripe cooking apples Pare and core them and slice 
them thin across the core. Fill paste-lined pie pans, 
about 2 layers deep. Thinly cover the apple slices 
with sugar and grate nutmeg over. Put i\ each pie 
butter gize of a walnut and a large spoonful of wa 
ter. Bake without a top crust slowly and dry. 
The apples become transparent and half candied. 



53, Pineapple Cream Pie. 



1 quart of pineapple either grated, or chopped 
and pounded. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

1 cupful of cream. 

12 yolks of eggs. 

C )ok the pineapp'e pulp and sugar together a few 
minutes, add the cream and the yolks well beaten, 
bake in thin crusts. The same ingredients all stirr- 
ed over the fite till cooked thick, make a pineapple 
cream to spread on layer cakes, and fill tarts. 

54. 

Cranberries have a better color cooked with the 
sugar. To a quart of cranberries allow a half pound 
of sugar, and water to cover the bottom of the ves- 
sel only, cook in their own steam about half an hour. 



They scorch easily — should not be set in the hottest 
place. The juice that can be strained from them 
without mashing makes the brightest jelly when 
cod. Mash the rest through a colander for pies. 

Strawberries should be put in the crusts raw and 
sugar strewn over. Canned strawberries shouid be 
strained from the juice and that boiled down with 
sugar to about half, and the fruit returned to it. 

Peaches use same as apples, also for peach custard 
pie. The peach kernels stewed with the fruit 
heighten the flavor. 

Gooseberries green require 12 ounces of sugar to 
a pound of fruit; they should be partly mashed 
with the back of a spoon for better mingling with 
the sweet. 

Plums and such large fruits are not serviceable 
unless cut or broken. A can of currants or whortle- 
berries will make five pies and the same sized can 
of plums only two or three. 

Quinces give an improved flavor to apples stewed 
with them. Quince pies may be made by grating 
the fruit and mixing with sugar, or by stewing 
sliced quinces wish water and lemon juice and then 
adding sugar to m ike a thin syrup. Best for shell 
pies. Bartlett pears make good pies. Some other 
varieties can be used like quinces. 

Rhubarb should be cooked with only water 
enough to cover the bottom of the kettle, a half 
pound of brown sugar to a pound of the stalks 
spread over the top and the steam shut in 

Raspberries, currants, blackberries and all such 
fruits as are apt lo become all juice should have the 
same avoidance of water as rhubarb and be cooked 
in their own steam. 

Bananas and Plantains are made into pies in the 
South in the same manner as has been directed for 
sliced apple pies, with mace and wine or brandy 
added. 

Tomatoes can be used in pies if boiled down with 
sugar. Scald and peel and let them drain of half 
their juice. To each pint of draied tomatoes allow 
4 ounces of sugar and a little bruised race ginger. 
Stew down thick. 

Figs either fresh or dried can be made into pies, 
cut up and stewed in syrup with a lemon or two and 
some butter. 

"That was like Macready at the Palladium. Ed. 
Forrest he quit the Palladium to go to the Athenae- 
um, and Ed had been throwing 'em up some jam up 
punkin pies and a lot of the fellows that get up late 
n the morning after breakfast hours got to coming 
and saying 'give me a punkin pie and some cofiee 
and I can wait till dinner,' and some of *em would 
eat two regular. So when Ed quit, all the boss 
could find on the town was Macready. He had to 
go on the night watch and there was about 75 pies 
to make before morning. So Mac. he goes to the 
night head waiter and says he, 'Fruit's all right but

say, how do you go to work to make a punkin pie? 
•Well, the head waiter he growls and Bays he 'Oh, 
what do you take me for? who's hired night o?ok 
here — ^you or me?' So Mac goes to work and rolls 
out his pies and opens the cans of punkin and 
spoons 'em out into the crusts without no sweeten in' 
nor nothing and bakes 'em off. And along in the 
morning the fellows began to drop in and one of 
them gets up on the high stool to the lunch counter 
and says he 'give me my tn o punkin pies and coffee.' 
Well, sir, he took a bite and began to oat, and then 
he stopped with it in bis mouth and studied like, 
and then he spit it out on the floor and says he 
what in the Halifax sort of a punkin pie is that any- 
how. And the pie business was entirely broke up 
and Macready he got bounced."

70. Allowing that is not strictly in the line of 
hotel fellows* duty to pass opinions wpon manners 
aid ways people have but considering the many as- 
persions that are cast upon pie and its friends, may 
we not ask one question — it is not more American- 
like to like pie and say you like pie, and make it 
big and make it good, than to beat about the bu^h 
and try to hide an inordinate admiration of pie 
under such names as darioles, bouchees, mirlitons, 
flans, vol-au'veats, tourtes, tartelettes and a lot more 
as the French do, and turnovers, puflFs and tarts like 
the E ig'ish? You will find if you look thai Mr. 
Cliva Newcome, in The Newcomes, when a b y at col- 
lege was remarkably fond of raspberry tarts and it 
took all hii pocket money and much that he man- 
aged to get from a friend or two besides to purchase 
them, and there is nothing sardonic in Mr. Tbacke^ 
ray'ssfflteraentof that not uncommon trait of his. But 
those raspberry tarts are not to be conf -unded for a 
minute with the indescribab'e English household pie— 
the tar! 8 weie and are neither more nor leps — exc?pt 
in size — than our American open pie?. Could Mr. 
Clive be blamed for loving them? Why even Amer- 
ican collegians are not above such a weakness as 
that. 

Tarte, tourte, tart is the European for the Ameri- 
can pie, made open — that is without a top crust — or 
at most with only strips across. The tart proper is 
not larger than the palm of the hand, and is made 
in patty pans or small pie pans of any form, ova', 
oblong, square or round. People like pie for supper, 
and country hotels with the old style of long table 
set them on it. but Fashion does not allow it. But 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



you can circumvent Fashion (and ane will be secret- 
ly pleased thereby) by serving tarts both for lunch - 
ton and supper. 

Now tarls or tiny pies are tedious to make in 
numbers and advantage must be takeo, get the shal- 
low pafty-pans fastened together a dozen in a bunch. 
Roll out the paste to an eighth of an inch thickness 
in a large sheet, and cut out flats with a biscuit cut- 
ter or any oval or other cutter that will match your 
patty-pans. Press the paste with the thumbs to 
the shape, cut off the surplus even with the edges 
and put in a spoonful of any kind of pie fruit or of 
the mixtures just preceding, or of the various creams, 
apple or cocoanut cream etc , and you can give pie 
for supper luncheon and tea and Fashion will tever 
be the wiser. 




Ihe small tartlets using up the pie paste remain- 
ing after dinner and taking but a teaspoonful of fill-

The fine leaf paste or puff-paste being ready there 
is nothing easier to make than vol-au-vent tartlets 
like those shown below. Roll out the paste to about 
a quarter of an inch in thickness, or even thinner, 
cut out with the double cutter, place the tartlets in 
pans like biscuits and bake in a brisk oven. They 
rise to three or four times the heighth of the paste 
they are cut from. Lift out the little lid made by 
the cutter in the middle or else push it down and 
fill the CHvity with a spoonful of red currant jelly or 
lemon honey or any kind of fruit or preserves. 



The tin. smiths make and keep for sale the double 
cutters that cut out rings for doughnuts and jum- 
bies, like two of these in the cut with the inside cut- 
ter on a level with the outside and cutting the mid- 
dle of the paste clear through, but the vol-au-vent 
cutters have to be made to order. The inner cut- 
ting edge is a sixteenth of an inch below the outer 
and only marks out a lid.

finest leaf paste to about an eighth of an inch in 
thickness. Cut it in squares of about 2 J inches and 
fold over the four corners to meet in the middle 
where there should be a drop of water placed to 
make them slick. Stamp out a round piece of pasta 
like a lozenge and lay on the center. Brush over 
with a little beaten egg-and-water without wetting 
the edges of the paste, and bake. The shell can be 
partly hollowed out when done, and filled with any

kind of mince or sweetmeat. 

2. For the left hand figure roll out the same as 
the preceding and cut and fold over the same and 
then cut pieces out of the four sides to make the 
shape shown. These leaf tartlets open out and rise 
as high in baking as the middle figure. Fill th® 
hollows with bright frait jelly 

3. The three cornered bouchees or tarts have the 
filling — either mince or salpican, or yellow or red 
conserve or jelly-baked in them. Roll out a sheet 
of puff-paste and cut out like biscuits, with a large 
cutter. Place a teaspoonful of the filling in each 
wet the edge of the paste and pinch it up in the 
shape of a three-cornered hat. Brush over with 
fgg-and water and dredge with granulated sugar if 
W a sweet tart. Bake in a rather slack oven. 

Beside the foregoing, other shapes may be made 
by stamping out the s 'iet of paste with an oval cut- 
ter and doubling the a's over like French split 
rolls, and by doubling ever square cuts. These 
open up like the leaves of a book and jelly or pre- 
serves can be inserted in the cavities. . 



T3. American Popular Ices. 

The combinations following are not too dreadfully 
original in idea to be eminently proper "according 
to Hoyle," neither are they copies. They are inno- 
cent American variations of the class of European 
"iced-puddings," and bombes a la Viennoise. They 
are popular ices in the sense that they are among 
the tbirsgs which make hotel tables popular with 
high-priced people. They are among the super-ex- 
cellerces and quiet gurprises which give — but there, 
we are getting beyond our depth — what we do want 
to say is that served individually they can be man- 
aged easily eioughin the hotels which do not em- 
ploy a confectioner or men specially detailed to 
make the ices, but where the pastry, cook has to be 
a man-of-all-work; while the moulding in 'bombes" 
involves a great expenditure of time and freezing 
material. These have all been well tried and often. 
The simplest and best methods of moulding, froth- 
ing, freezing etc. will also be found explained among 
the commoner ices further on. 



Hastorskill Ices. 



Combination of rose pink cream with pale green 
ice containing grapes and almonds. Two freezers 
lequired. 

14, Rose Ice Cream* 

I quart of cream. 

12 ounces of sugar. 



12 eggs. 

A pinch of palt, coloring and flavoring. 

Take off a third of the cream, the thickeet, from 
the top, and keep it cold to be whipped to frothy 
while the other is freezing. Boil the rest of the 
cream with (he sugar in it, which prevents burning. 
Beat the eggs in a bowl as light as if for sponge 
cake, pour the boiling cream and sugar to them and 
cook about a minute together — enough to slightly 
thickea but not boil. Strain into a freezer immedi- 
ately, add a few drops of rose extract and some 
bright red fruit syrup such as the surplus juice from 
crimson strawberries in sugar, or else some drops of 
red coloring, to make the ere im light pink. Freeze, 
and when nearly finished whip the reserved cream 
to froth and beat it in. 

When cream thick enough to whip cannot be had 
keep out the whites of the eggs and use the same 
way instead. 

75. Grape and Almond Ice. 

6 pints of sweet white muscat grapes free from 
stems. 

1 pint of angelica or other sweet wine. 

1 pint of water. 

1 pound of sugar. 

1 large ripe lemon. 

1 pound of almonds blanched. 

Stew three pints of the grapes with the water and 
sugar and when tender rub the pulp through a 
strainer into a freezer, together with the syrup. 
Add the wine and the lemon cut in th ck short 
slices with the seeds carefully excluded, and 
freeze the mixture. At the last drop in the 
blanched almonds and after a few more turns of the 
freezer add the remaining 2 pints of grapes previous- 
ly made cold on ice. C^ver down the freezer that 
the ice may become well f ozen. 

To serve individually make a border of the 
cream with the spoon in broad champagne glasses or 
fancy ice glasses, and in the middle pile the grape 
and almond sherbet. 

For fancy moulded creams line the moulds with 
the first part and fill the centers with the second. 

YO. 

A favorite form of bombe is frozen in a mould in 
the shape of a little glass jug with handle and all 
compl< te. This is coated inside with a translucent 
fruit or flavored syrup ice and the filling is of, for ex- 
ample, a maraschino ice cream, or one dotted with 
strawberries. V hen the bombe well frozen is taken 
out of its mould and set on the table on its folded 
napkin, you are, if you please, to knock off the neck 
of the ju^ and dip out the contents. It is surmised 
that it is called a bomb because it goes off pretty

77, Yellow Frozen Custard. 
1 qu irt of cream or milk. 
12 ounces of sugar. 
12 yolks of eggs. 

Vanilla bean or extract to flavor. 
Boil the cream with the sugar and vanilla bean 

in it Beat the yolks light and pour the boiling 
cream to them. Set on the fire again for a minute. 
The custard will not froth in the freezer if cooked 
much, but should be taken off and strained aa soon 
as slightly thickened. Freeze and beat light. 

78. Orange and Cocoanut Ice* 
1 pittt of port wine, 
1 pint of water. 

1 pound of sugar. 
8 ounces of desiccated cocoanut — the sugared kind 

free from oil must be used. 
4 oranges. 

2 lemons. 

Red fruit juice or^coloring. 
M*ke a hot syrup of the water and sugar. Slice 

the oranges and lemons small and throw away the 
seeds, put the slices in a bowl with the desiccated 
cocoanut, pour the hot syrup over them and let steep 
a short time. Then strain the flavored syrup into a 
freezer, add the wine and coloring to make it light 
pink and freeze. M'ike the scalded orange and 
lem)n slices and cocoanut cold on ice and stir them 
into the sherbet when nearly frozen, then pack down 
the freezer to freeze the contents firm. 

To serve individually place the frozen custard in 
champagne glasses, spread out to make a border, 
and the sherbet pile up in the middle. 

And "iced-pudding" is no better name, although 
the language containing no other for such a com- 
pound, the English have had to use it. But their 
case is different, they have deep rooted respect for 
ancieot pudding, and ice cream does not seem to be 
degrrtded by being so calif d. Sydney Smith in es

Monitou Ices. 



Rocky Mountain scarlet wild raspberries iia ioei 
and a white cream. Two freezers required. 
79. White Starch Ice Cream. 
1 quart of rich milk. 
12 ounces of sugar. 

1 ounce of butter. 

2 rounded tablespoonfuls of corn starch. 
4 whites of eggs. 

1 tablespoonful of lemon extract. 
Boil the milk with the sugar in it. Mix the 

starch in a cup with a little cold milk and stir it in 
Take from the fire, and put in the butter and beat 
the mixture till that is melted. Strain, cool and fla 
vor it and freeze. W hen nearly finished freezing 
whip the whites to froth and stir them into the 
cream, then beat it with a paddle till it fills the 
freezer, and is as light as foam and white as snow. 
80. Scarlet Raspberry Ice, 

3 or 4 pints of Rocky Mountain wild raspberries. 
1^ pounds of sugar. 

2 pints of water. 

3 whites cf eggs. 
Pick out and reserve about a third of the berries 

to be dropped whole into the ice at last. 

Make a syrup of the sug^r and one pint of water, 
pour it hot upon the larger portion of raspberries in 

bowl and then rub them through a strainer togeth- 
er with the syrup, and use the other pint of water 
to help the pulp through when dry. Freeze, and 
add the whites of eggs beaten to froth when nearly 
finished and after beatipg up again drop in the 
whole raspberries and pack down the freezer with 
more ice and salt to remain till wantedo 

Serve the white cream in glasses or saucers with 
the red^ice piled in the hollow middle.

Frozen Fruit in Ices. 



Broadly speaking it may be said, everybody that 
likes fruit ices or sherbets likes the frozen pieces of 
fruit scattered through them as well. But there are

Tahoe Ices. 

Red grape ice and white cherries in cream. Two 
freezers required. 

82. Red Grape Ice. 

6 pin's of red Tokay grapes (4 pounds.) 

IJ pints of wafer. 

IJ pounds of sugar. 

1 lemon and 1 orange. 

4 whites of eggs. 

Select about a fourth part of the grapes to be 
dropped whole into the ice at last. Scald the rest 
in a syrup made cf the sug<ir and part of the water 
and rub the pulp through a strainer together with 
the syrup and pour over the skins the remaining 
portion of water, add the jiice of the lemon and 
reeze as usual. If to line a mould the whites of 
eggs may be omitted and a little red fruit juice or 
coloring can be added to make a more positive color, 
but for serving in glasses add the whites whipped 
firm and beat the ice till smooth and foamy. Cut 
the orange in strips, without peeling, and strew 
them in the ice, also the reserved grapes and cover 
down to freeze firm. 

83. White Cherry Cream. 

1 quart of pure sweet cream. 

8 or 4 pints of California white wax cherries. 

1 pound of sugar. 

^ pint of water. 

Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and water, 
drop in the cherries and let them simmer in it 
about 15 minutes, without stirring or breaking. 
Then strain the flavored pyrup into the freezer and 
set the fruit on ice, to be mixed in at last. Add the 
quart of cream to the syrup in the freezer, freeze 
and beat up well, then stir in the cherries and pack 
down with more ice and salt. 

Artificial ice made at a cost of one dollar a ton; 
ice cream same price. *'It were a consummation de- 
voutly to be wished." We are thinking not of the 



finished product after it has left our hands — perhaps 
the young gentlemen who take the young ladies out 
en summer evenings would not wish it quite so 
cheap — but of some easy and perfect process of freez- 
ing it such as is condensed and summed up in the 
idea conveyed by that rate of cheapness. For few 
know how difficult it is to get the drudgery of ice- 
cream freezing done properly, none perhaps but 
those who have to oversee its preparation along with 
a number of other skill-demanding productions for 
the hotel dinner. It is of little avail that we make 
the cre^m or custard or sherbet good and finely fla- 
vored if the transformations possible in the freezing 
process be not skilfully carried out. In freezing, if 
you know how, you can transform skimmed milk in- 
to the semblance of cream, and if you don't you can 
not prevent rich cream from transforming itself into 
the semblance of skimmed milk. 

Now when they get through with that tedious 
eleotrio light subdivision perhaps the inventors will 
subdivide theariificial ice machines so that ice cream 
can be made in every little house in some less clum- 
sy and imperfect way than the present with ice and 
salt. The great obstructionist in ice cream making 
is the lazy yardman, second pastry-cook or other 
helper who ought to turn the freezer fast and beat 
the cream thoroughly, and we want an electrical or 
chemical machine of some kind to supersede him.

'school marm who once did the copying of some of 
these receipts happened to be a White Mountain 
girl herself and when she reached this sett she sur- 
reptitiously took the name and placed it over anoth-

White Mountains or Green Mountains either for that 
matter. Red grapes indeed! Which sett she chose

Two freezers required. 

84. Vanilla Ice Cream— Best^ 

1 quart of good sweet cream.

utes, or till it fills the freezer. Cover down and 
pack with more ice and salt. 
85. Peacli Ice. 

3 pints of peeled mellow peaches. 

1 pound of sugar. 

2 pints of water. 

1 large cupful of bright red currant jelly. 
The kernels of half the peaches. 

4 whites-of eggs. 

The peaches should be choice, yellow or red 
fleshed and sweet. Half of them are to be cut in 
pieces as large as cherries, the other half cooked. 

Put the water, sugar, peach kernels and half the 
peaches on to stew together for a few minutes, mash 
the fruit with the back of a spoon, put in the currant 
jelly and then press all (except the kernels) through 
a strainer. Freeze as usual, add the whipped white . 
of eggs to to the ice and after beating also mix in the 
cut peaches. 

Line the moulds wih the cream and fill the center 
with the peach ice, or serve the cream in glasses or 
saucers as a border with the peach piled in the 
middle. 

Some Points on loe-oream and other 
Ices. 



So I said to Johnny said I, Johnny you're, stuck 
with this miserable little ice-cream saloon, and the 
little seventy five dollars you' ve put in is gone sky- 
wards, don't you know it? And you owe a month's 
rent beside. And here at the same time are your 
dollars that ought to be and your tens and hundreds 
sitting along on the hotel piazzas and riding by and 
walking right by your forsaken little den, but they 
won*t come in. Of course they won't. Why should 
they when you don't know the first rudiments of the 
business. Johnny, don't you remember when you 
used to turn the freezers for two mortal hours enough 
sight slower tlian the tick of your grandfather's 
clock, when you ought to have been done in twenty 
or thirty minutes, wasting ice and salt, spoiling the 
cream and wearing out me? And now you'll go up 
for want of knowing something. Now if you was 
dead for instance and a smart boy had this instead 
it would not be this way. There are bigger resorts 
than this, don't you know? and some where the 
confectioneries and all are made under the same 
roof, but, let me tell you, even there the extra fine 
creams and ices are in a side show and are extra 
charges, and more so at all commoner places unless 
the pastry cook has uncommon ambition to shine. 
But you take a hotel that's got two hundred summer 
people, and there's two pastry cooks, but after 



they've worked up their barrel of flour a day In 
all shapes, and other things in proportion, and hot 
weather at that, they don't feel much like spreading 
themselves on fancy creams and ices, and it's the 
same miserable lemon custard and vanilla oustard 
sort of frozen any way to put it through at this ho- 
tel and that hotel, and if the people are asked to 
visit at the other hotel they are sure to be treated 
to the same old thing again. Well then they go to 
the cafe and fine restaurant where these things are 
made specialties, and that's what you ought to be 
doing now Johnny if jou knew how. 

But in the first place you don*t have ice-cream on 
hand half the time and people as they pass say <<oh 
its of no use, they hardly ever have any there,'* so 
they quit coming because they don't like to be dis- 
appointed, you must keep it if you have to make a 
pint at a time in a quart cup even, as you easily can 
ifyou understand it, and it positively must be al- 
ways good, always tip-top, ifyou expect to build up 
a trade, and it can't be if you make it once a day, 
in the morning, and keep it all day and night; for 
the goodness of it is its smoothness and creaminess, 
but that gets away when the cream is kept long 
Water in freezing will separate from everything 
else, so that you get clear ice out of muddy rivers, 
and the water part of vinegar will treeze and leave 
the acid part by itself in the center of the barrel; 
just that way your cream first gets grains of clear ice 
in it like sand, and by night your customers find 
rough chunks as big as pipe stems. For the very 
same reasons good cream cannot be made by letting 
it stand and freeze itself. It wants rapid work. 

QUICK FREEZINO. 

Now, Johnny, you begin right. Get you a stout 
oaken box bound with hoop iron ifyou can, to pound 
the ice small in. It will prove the cheapest way in 
the long run, for you must pound the ice small to 
do quick freezing and cheap, and no way beats 
pounding it with an old axe head in a deep box. 
You may turn your freezer two hours and do no 
good if it has only Isrge lumps of ice just touching it 
with their edges. It is the salt acting on the ice 
and releasing the cold by melting it that causes your 
cream to freeze and the quicker the melting takes 
place through thorough mixing of salt in fine ice the 
quicker your cream is done, and coarse salt is bet 
ter than fine because it won't pack in dead lumps, 
and because it grinds the ice away. We are not 
caring for strict science, only for the effects as they 
appear. So the quickest possible freezing is done 
with snow and ice mixed together. And, Johnny, 
don't you remember how snorting mad you used to 
be when I would come down on you for about tw« 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK.

Beconds while you was see sawing away at Ihatfreez^ 
er and say "why in thunder don't yru let the salt 
water out?" — and when I came again and found the 
water out it was "what in thunder did yi>u let all 
the water out for?" 

Well, Johnny, I have no meringues in the oven 
DOW and I'll stop to explain. Your cream never 
freezes much except where the brine of the melted 
ice and salt touches the freezer, as the brine rises 
•rtside you will find the freezing mark rises inside; 
but when there gets to be too much water the ice ri- 
ses and floats and the bottom of the freez?r b g'ns 
to melt agiin. You want to keep letting out a little 
water from the bung-hole near the bottom of the 
freezing tub but not too much, and always keep push 
ingand packing the ice down arourd the freezer to 
keep it solid and touching both bottom and sides. In 
this way you can do freezing in twenty or thirty 
minutes better than in two hours. The amount of 
salt you want is about one bucket of salt to five of 
broken ice. Half fill your freezing tub with ice 
first, then begin putting in scoopfuls of salt with the 
ice, and it will work itself down. Always finish cfi 
the top with a layer of salt. Don't you see now 
what an idiot you was not to understand these little 
things, and the quality of the cream for two hundred 
high-toners depending on your ignorance? In order 
to get the little brine sometimes in the dead of win- 
ter when everything was too cold I have had to pour 
hot water on the ice in the freezing tub to start it. 
These points apply to all sorts of freezers that use 
ice and salt. The noted cooks across the sea who 
nvented some of the fine ices that you are going to 
make after awhile Johnny, never patronized our 
new patent freezers but did and perhaps still do their 
fine work with the old kind turned by hand. 

CBEAM AND ITS SUBSTITUTES. 

And, Johnny, you don't need real cream so much 
as you need a thorough beating. If a man that knew 
how was to open next door in opposition toyou he might 
take milk and you might take cream, and soon you 
would hear customers say "ah, the cream next door 
is the best, it certainly must be made of the purest 
cream, you can taste it, it is so rich!" when in fact 
it would be its foamy smoothness and delicacy that 
gave them the impression, while your real cream 
would be coarse with grains of ice, and heavy with 
sugar. It does not make nearly so much difference 
how you make your cream as how you freeze it and 
keep it. Why you may take a sweet water ice, es- 
pecially a white cherry ice, or a peach ice \7ill do, 
some kind with the sweet pulp mashed in it, and 
make it according to disectiens it will be so white, 



so soft and foamy, and will increiee in bulk so much 
it can't be told from cream except by melting which 
I want to say shows that it isn't the cream itsel 
that makes the quality, since sweetened fruit juice 
will do so well, and better yet if mixed with cream 
like our cherries in cream some way back, but ttie 
method. So having prepared your cream, custard, 
or sherbet put it in a freezer large enough to hold 
twice as much and strive to make the ice fill the 
freezer when done. 

The greatest help but not the only material for 
the purpope is seme raw but light-beaten white of 
eggs. The Freuch cooks, some of them, use what 
they call Italian meringue, which is aboiiing sugar 
yrup made of six runces of sugar, poured into four 
whites well whipped. If anyone who has tri d has 
fuund a difference in effect between that and the raw 
whites I will not gainsay their word, but, Johnny, y u 
will find the shorter way good enough and it saves su- 
gar from wl at 'm already generally too sweet. So when 
your ice is frozon mix in the whipped whites, and if 
it is a patent f.eezer turn it as fast as you can til 
y u see the white ice forcing its way out at the freezf 
er lid. That is if you want that sort, but if it is on- 
ly a demi-glace leave out the whites, like the pink 
part of our Niagara ices, where the white desiccated 
cocoanut can be seen powdered all through as it 
could not be if the sherbet was beaten to whiteness 
with egg. 

SAVE THE SUGAR 

And don't make the mistake tf using too much su- 
gar. You must make a profit, and sugar is an ex 
pease in two ways, in its cost at first and then in 
ice and salt for the more sugar^ in your creim the 
more ice it will take to freeze it. This you know is 
for common, though you want to be posted for fan- 
cy work too. When you go to Boston or Philadel- 
phia, Johnny, you'll find them advertising "Vieina 
ices," bombes, bisquitsglacees, etc. If made "accord- 
icg to Hoyle" these Vienna ices have a pound of su- 
gar in every quart of rich cream, and the rule for 
fruit ices is a pound and a half to a quart. Just 
think of it — a cupful of granulated sugar in two 
cupfuls of thick cream, and the fruit ices and sor 
be! s all syrups heavier than soda syrups. When 
these are well frozen they are more of frozen con- 
fectioneries, or candies made by cold instead of 
heat then they are light refreshments. They are in- 
tended to be shaped in moulds and to have a good 
deal of solidity. Your rule for common ice-cream 
should be not more than half a pound of sugar to 
each quart of milk and three quarters of a pound to 
each quart of fruit ice or sherbet, and Johnny, 
though I would not write it so in a receipt for any-

body, for it might seem stingy, between you and me 
I think six ounces ot sugar to eaoh quart of milk is 
enough for the ice-cream that is only a light refresh- 
ment that people may oat plenty of without hurting 
themselves. They don't want food, but frozen per- 
fume. 

I got a lesson in popular ice-cream making when 
I was a boy that has lasted me for comparison of 
different fellows* wajs ever since, at a gaily decora 
ted tent at New Orleans, on the levee and facicg 
Tchoupitoulas f treet, where their cream was sold 
as fast as tickets for a circus, handed cut in glasses 
piled high, three or four colors and flavors, and as 
many men freezing and beating, and as many more 
gelling and forever yelling out, "Come up with an 
other freezer on the red," and "como up with an- 
other freezer on the yaller." Their cream was 
light, and cheap and plentiful. It was late ia May, 
and all the iee they need had come in ship loads 
from the north. They didn't sit down and see-saw 
and Johnny, I don't think they used over six ounces 
of sugar to a quart. But they had fine flavorings, 
and you donH think they had any real cream or 
wanted any, do you? 

ANi'IBILIOUS ICE-CBEAM. 

And you need not go into bankruptcy either 
merely because the big hotels are getting what little 
cream there is to be had and you can get none. 
They don't even get enough for coffee, after all. 
Some restaurant keepers buy the milk, skim it for 
the cream and trust to selling off the skimmed milk 
or part of it, so as to get their pure cream for freez- 
ing not soured and mouldy as country gathered 
cream often is, but that plan is not practicable for 
ice-cream for thousands at a resort. Besides, who 
wants cream? you see these reeorts getting more 
crowded every year and more hotels and Iwirger ones 
being built, and that shows that the people find it 
pleasant living at them, but they wouldn't if they 
had the blues and felt tired and drowsy all the time 
as they would be if they were made bilious and dys- 
peptic with double cream and sugar. There is noth- 
ing 30 bad for the health and spirits as real buttery 
cream taken at the end of a full meal. Let the count, 
ry people who have nothing to do but sleep eat the 
cream, but you give the resorters light refreshment 
and if your wares are well made they will come 
again after they have walked and danced and rolled 
ten pins. 

GELATINE IN CBEAM. 

It is reckoned quite a triclr too, to put gelatine in 
your milk cr boiled custard aod gelatine is nice 
enough as f«r as that goes, but somehow, John- 
ny, I find myself always letting it alone, though I 
don't know what T might do in compe ition with 
others. Gelatine gives body to the mi? k and makes 
it BO it can be beaten up mo^e light and fio'hy and 
the cream with ge'atine in will not melt down so 
quickly. It is a good enough rule to use gelatine 



in milk and white of eggs in water ices, punches and 
so forth. The effect cf both articles is about the 
same, but gelatine is the most irjuble But you 
have to be very careful ab !ut the quantity of gela- 
tine used for if you don't look out it will set your 
cnam like b'anc-mange or jelly. One ounce to three 
quarts is the highest you can use, and it must be 
well dissolved in warm Uiilk before putting in. 

OBDINABY ICE-Cr EAM. 

You will see some ice-cream makers put raw yolks 
of eggs in the cream because, they have found that 
cooking the eggs in it destroys the frothing quality. 
I dont like that either, and I compromise by making 
a boiled sarch custard with scant one ounce of 
8 arch to each quart of milk, and beating two or 
three, or at most four yolks to a quart light in a 
deep pan and pouring the scaMing custard to them 
which h)lf cooks the yolks and makes a custard 
that can be churned to a froth if wanted. 



When you make a custard that way it saves ice to 
cook only half the milk with all the enriching ingre- 
dients in and pour the other half cold to it after- 
wards. When you boil milk always boil the sugar 
in it, and that will prevent scorching on the bottom. 
Now, Johnny, brace up and go to'wrrk, and when 
you get as far as moulding ice creams for party din- 
ners we will talk again. But that heavy iron scrap- 
er you have got made by a blacksmith is notjirui table, 
people of fine perceptions c^n taste iron in cream, be- 
sides you are liable to drive it through the bottom 
of your freezer and spoil all. The largest size flexi- 
ble palette knife is the best thing to loosen the fro- 
zen cream from the. sides of your old fashioned 
freezer, and for the beating up of the cream make 
jourself a paddle of hard wood as long as a spade, 
but light and narrow; one that you can stand up 
wi h and have a good hold on to churn and beat 
with both hands. 

FLAVOKINO 

Lemon and vanilla are the common popular flavors 
and lemon is the commonest of the two. Ui-e of 
them about a large basting spoonful of the extract to 
each gallon of cream, remembering, however, that 
there is the common, the doub'e and the triple extract 
of which latter of course less ought to do. " hen you 
get to doing a big business you will have the pleasure 
of offering yijur customers acho'ca of as many flavors 
of cream as there are of soda syrups. But all 
flavors except lemon and vanilla must be used very 
sparingly, a teaspoonful of pineapple, strawberry, 
pear and the like generally being as good as a large 
spoonful of the otho'-s, and of rose extr ict a few 
drops may do. Most of the flavorings excepting 
lemon, vanilla, rose, cinnamon, and nutmeg are 
made from orris root and butyric ether — which is 
obtained from rancid butter — and there is no won- 
der if the popular taste approves of them only in 
very small allowances.

86. Frozen Nesselrode Pudding. 

Glace Nesselrode or iced pudding, A frozen cus- 
tard made of pounded chestnuts, with fruit and fla- 
vorings : 

1 pound of large chestnuts — about 40. 

1 pint of rich boiled custard. 

1 cup sweet cream. 

2 ounces citron. 

2 ounces sultana raisins. 

2 ounces stewed pineapple. 

i cupful of maraschino. 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract. 

Pinch of salt in the chestnut pulp. 

Slit the shells of the chestnuts, boil them half an 
hour, peel clean, and pound the nuts to a paste, and 
rub it through a coarse sieve, moistening with 
cream. Then mix it with the boiled custard. Freeze 
this mixture, and when firm whip the cup of cream, 
and stir it in and freeze again. Then add the citron 
cut in shreds, the stewed or candied pineapple, like- 
wise the raisins, maraschino, and vanilla extract. 
Beat up and freeze again, and either serve in ice 
cream plates out of the freezer, or pack the cream 
in a mold, and when well frozen send to table 
whole, turned out of the mold on to a folded napkin 
on a di£h. 

The foregoing makes about enough to fill one of 
those brick molds that have a large and deep 
stamped fruit pattern in the lid and when frozen 
firm it can be sliced into from 12 to 16 portions. 
When chestnut! are not convenient some of the large 
cafes use the ready prepared pounded aUnonds or 
walnuts that may be bought by the can at the con- 
fectioners' supply stores, and various additions or 
substitutions of green candied fruits are employed to 
make a handsome appearing compound without 
changing its general character Should be trebled in 
quantity for dinner for fifty.

Cardinal Punch. 



A survival of the old-time spiced wine called 
"bishop;" the same was called cardinal when made 
with the best of red wine. The specialty about it is 
in roasting the oranges either before or over the fire, 
and letting them steep in good red wine, which, when 
thus flavored, is used either hot or cold. If to be 
frozen take 

1 quart of wine jelly (calPs foot or gelatine.) 

1 quart of claret or any good red wine. 

1 quart of port. 

1 quart of water. 

2 pounds of sugar. 
4 oranges. 

2 tablespoonfuls of whole cloves. 

Bake the oranges brown on a plate in the oven. 
Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and water with 
the cloves in it, drop the baked oranges into it, add 
the wine and let remain until cold. Cut the oranges 
and press them for the juice, and strain the punch 
into the freezer. Add the jelly (or white of eggs for 
a substitute) and freeze. If in season for red rasp- 
berry juice add some for brighter color. 



93a. 



Angelica Punch. 



2 cups California Angelica wine. 

2 cups hot water — a pint. 

1 cup sugar — J pound. 

1 cup stemmed raisins — J pound. 

1 lemon. 

2 whites of eggs and two tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar to beat in. 

Chop the raisins, grate half the rind of the lemon, 
squeeze in all of the juice, pour the hot water to 
them, add the sugar, and stir until it is all dissolved. 
Strain the flavored syrup thus obtained into a 
freezer, and rub the most of the raisin pulp through 
as well. Add the wine and freeze. When nearly 
frozen whip the two whites and the powdered sugar 
together till thick, add them to the punch and finish 
freezing. It is like cream. Serve in stem glasses. 



93b. 



Bisque Ice Creams* 



Ice creams with a proportion of the pulp of 
pounded fruit or nuts added are termed bisques, 

93c. Bisque of Pineapple Ice Cream. 

1 can pineapple or | pound. 

2 cups sugar. 
4 cups cream. 

Chop the pineapple small and put it in a bright 
pan or kettle with the sugar and a few spoonfnls of 
juice or water to dissolve the sugar to S)Tup. Sim- 
mer at the side of the range a short time. 

Whip the cream till it is half froth, then freeze it 
first by itself, because the pineapple added before 
freezing has a tendency to curdle it. Pound the 
pineapple and syrup through a colander, mix it with 
the partly frozen cream, and freeze again. 

It can and ought to be managed to have the pine- 
apple in syrup prepared beforehand to be cold. In 
making these bisques it is not best to pound the 
fruit perfectly fine, but the small pieces about like 
grains of wheat should be perceptible and show that 
the creams are mixed with fruits and not merely 
flavored. 

93d. Bisque of Preserved Ginger. 

i pound of either preserved or candied ginger. 

i cup sugar. 

Juice of one lemon. 

4 cups of cream. 

Cut tfie candied ginger into very small pieces. 
Make a hot syrup of the sugar with a few spoonfuls 
of water and squeeze the lemon into it, then put in 
the ginger and let it soften and impart the flavor to 
the syrup. Put the cream and ginger and syrup all 
together, freeze and beat up. 



93c. 



Apricot Ice. 



3 cupfuls of apricots cut in pieces. 

1 cupful of sugar — Bounces. 

2 cupfuls of water. 

The kernels of half the apricots. 

2 whites of eggs. 

The ripest and sweetest apricots, if the fresh fruit 
be used, should be kept out, one cupful to be mixed 
in the ice when finished. 

Stew the other two cupfuls and the peeled kernels 
in the water and sugar for a few minutes, rub 
the fruit then with the back of a spoon, through a 
strainer into the freezer along with the syrup. 
Freeze like ice cream and when it is nearly finished 
whip the two whites to a firm froth, mix them in and 
turn the freezer rapidly a short time longer. Stir in 
the cut apricots just before serving. Canned apri- 
cots can be used as well, and if in sjrrup that can be 
mixed in also.

Cumberland Ices 

Red cherry ice with nut cream. Two freezers re- 
quired. 

94. Red Cherry Ice. 

4 pints of sweet red or black cherries. 

2 pints ff water. 

IJ pounds of sugar. 

M»!sh the fruit raw and thoroughly so as to break 
the stones, and strain the juice through a fin« strain- 
er into the freezer. Boil the cherry pulp with some 
of the sugar and water to extract the flavor from 
the kernels, and ma?h that also through the strain, 
er, add the other pint of water and the sugar and 
freeze. Use no egg whites and only beat the ice 
enough to make it even and smooth, 

95. Hickory Nut Ice Cream. 

1 pound of either pecan or hickory nut kernels. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

1 quart of rich milk or cream. 

1 tablespconful of burnt sugar coloring. 

Pick over the kernels carefully that there be no 
fragments of shells to make the cream gritty, then 
pound them in a mortar with part of the sugar and 
& few spoonfuls of milk or other fluid. Only a few 
can be pounded efiectually at a time. Mix the milk 
with the pulp thus obtained, the rest of the sugar 
and caramel coloring enough to make it like coffee 
and cream, and run it through a strainer into the 
freezer. 

Freeze it as usual and beat smooth with the pad- 
dle, then pack down with more ice to freeze firm. 

Line the moulds with the cherry ice and fill the 
middle with the cream, or, dish the ice as a bord- 
er in shallow glasses with the cream piled in the 
center. 



Oape May Ices. 
Burnt almond ice-cream and orange ice. 
96. Almond Bisque. 

Take 1 pound of sugar. 

12 ounces of sweet almonds. 

2 ounces of bitter almonds. 

Blanch the almonds, split them and put them in 
a slack oven to dry and acquire a light yellow col- 
or. Put the sugar in a kettle on the fire without 
any water and stir it till it is all melted and of the 
color of go'den syrup or light molasses. Then put 
in the hot almonds, stir gently to mix, and pour the 
candy on to a large platter. 

When cold pound the candy quite fine, put it in- 
to 3 pints of rich milk, set it on the fire and when it 
boils add the beaten yolks of 10 eggs. Strain the 



burnt almond custard thus made into a freezer and 
freeze as usual and beat light, 

97. Orange Ice. 

3 pints of water. 

1 pound of sugar. 

5 or 6 oranges according to size. 

1 lemon, juice only, if the oranges are sweet. 

4 whites of e gs. 

Make a thick syrup of the sugar and very little 
wa<er. Peel half the oranges, divide l hem each in 
12 or more by pulling apart by the natural divis- 
ions and drop i he pieces of orange in the boiling 
syrup. Grate the yellow zest of the other 3 oran- 
ges into a bowl and squeeze in the juice, then pour 
the syrup from < he scalded orange slices a^so into 
the bowl through a strainer and keep the pieces on 
ice to be mixed in at the last. Add the water and 
lemon jnice to the orange syrup io the bowl, strain 
and freeze. Beat in the whipped whites as usual 
and when finished stir in the sugared fruit. 

This ice is cream-white, tinged with the orange 
zet and juice. 

Use the burnt almond cream for the oatside and 
fill with the orange ice. 



98. Chocolate Ice Oream 



Use only 3 or 4 ounces of the common unsweete 
ened chocolate to a gallon of cream or boiled cus- 
tard. Chocolate cream is generally too strongly fla- 
vored for the majority. The foreign vanilla chocolate 
s about ha' f sugar and more of course can be used. 
Boil the chocolate in some milk with sugar added, 
strain it into the cream and flavor with vanilla be- 
sides. Beat the ice cream to make it bright and 
rich colored. Melted chocolate cannot be mixed at 
once in cold cream, as it sets and makes trouble, it 
must be considerably diluted first. 



99. 



Coffee Ice Oream. 



Make with pure sweet cream only, and 1 pint of 
very strong clear coffee to 3 quarts. Sugar as usu- 
al — 8 ounces to a quart. The best coffee for this 
purpose is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee 
in cold water over night and not boiling it at all. 
Hot coffee from the urn will answer if taken when 
fresh made and not inky. 



and Maraschino Ice Creams. 



Curacoa 
lOO. 

For combinations with strawberry and pineapple 
ices. Use a cupful of curacoa to 3 qua^^ts of cream

or custard. Coif r the cream cafe-au-lait witli 2 oun- 
ces of sugar burnt to the color of golden syrup and 
then dissolved in milk. Beat the ice cream to make 
it gold color. Use the same proportion of mara- 
schino in pure cream and beat the ice cream to 
whiteness, 



lOl. 



Strawberry Ice. 



2 quarts of strawberries — red ripe and sweet. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

3 pints of water. 

Cover the strawberries with the sugar and let 
them remain some time to fyrm a thick red syrup 
Pick out a few of the berries to be mixed in the ice 
St last. Rub the rest through a strainer into the 
freezer with the syrup and add the water. Freeze 
without much beating if a crimson ice is wanted, and 
add coloring if necessary. Throw the reserved ber- 
ries on top of the strawberry ice in the freezer and 
mix them in when the ice is to be served. 



lO^. 



Currant Ice. 



Make currant water ice the same as the strawber- 
ry ice preceding, except that no whole fruit need 
be saved out. Cooked or canned currants are not 
suitable, being too gelatinous and of poor color, and 
only the best and ripest of the fresh fruit should b 
employed for this purpose. The most luscious cur- 
rants do not grow in America. 

103. 

The hotel pastry cook has very little need of arti- 
ficial coloring. The rich colors of the various fruits 
n their season may be preserved with but slight 
^rouble by taking the surplus ju*ces and boiling 
them with plenty of sugar, often in the same kettle 
the fruit was cooked in for pie^, and straining the 
syrup into botiUs. Such syrups will keep a long 
time and while the writer is well aware that any 
elaborate process of the sort would never be put in 
practice in hotel work, he can recommend the 
seizing upon such things as come to hand this way 
as positive labor-saving expedients. A bottle of 
strawberry or raspberry syrup put away at an odd 
time comes splendidly in place to mix with a freezer 
of cream in the winter or spring. 



104. Strawberry Ice Oream. 

2 quarts of strawberries — red ripe and sweet. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

2 quarts of cream. 

Cover the fruit with the sugar and mash them 
together and rub the fruit and syrup through a 
seive into a bowl, adding a cupful of water to the 
pulp at last. 

Half freeze the cream by itself and then add the 
strawberry syrup and finish the freezing as usual. 



105. 



Pineapple loe. 



2 cans of pineapple. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

2 quarts of water. 

6 or 8 whites of eggs. 

Strain the juice from the cans into the freezer. 
Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and 1 quart of 
water and throw in the pieces of pineapple previously 
crt in large d'ce. Let boil a few minutes and then 
strain the flavored syrup algo iuto the freezer. Add 
the other quart of water and freeze. Strew some eu- 
gar over the pieces of pineapple and set them on ice. 
When the syrup is nearly fiozen add some red fruit 
juice or coloring to make it rose pnk, and the 
whipped whites, beat and freeze again. Throw the 
pieces of pineapple on top, cover down and let re- 
main till time to serve, then mix them in. 

The canned pineapple is generally riper and 
sweeter than the fresh fruit that is sent to Northern 
markets. When the latter is used it should be cut 
up, have hot syrup poured over and allowed to steep 
till cold. Two cans contain about 1^ pounds of 
pineapple. The juice of 1 or 2 lem ns is sometimes 
added to a pineapple ice when the fruit is very 
sweet. 



Pineapple Water Ice or Sherbet. 
lOO. 

The same proportions as the preceding receipt 

Chop the pineapple small, scald it in the boiling 
syrup, then pound it through a strainer with the 
syrup and remaining quirt of water into a freezer. 
Freeze, add 4 whites of eggs and beat it perfectly 
white. 



lOT. Pineapple Ice Oream. 

Make the same as directed in the preceding t&> 
ceipt with 2 quarts of rich cream instead of water, 
and use no eggs. Pineapple syrup or pulp poured 
in'o cream will immediately curdle it. The cream 
must be nearly frozen first and then the pineapple 
added to it and the freezing finished. 

Frozen Cocoanut Custard or Oocoanut 
108. Ice Cream. 

3 quarts of milk. 

18 ounces of sugar. 

15 yolks of eggH. 

1 pound of desiccated cocoanut — the sugared kind 
free from oil and rancidity is best. 

Make the custard as usual and stir in the cocoa, 
nut while it is still warm after straining. Freeze and 
beat as usual. A little lemon or orange flavoring 
can be added. 

The ordinary ice cream or starch custard can be 
u3ed the same way as well. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK.

lOO. Concord Grape Ice. 



A reddish purple, useful for combinations and for 
Neapolitan or tri colored ices. 

4 ounces of ripe Concord grapes — a cupful. 

1 pound of sugar. 

1 quait of wafer. 

Juice of one lemon. 

Mi>-h »he graprs and sugar together raw, add the 
lemon Juice and water, strain into a freez r with 
all the pulp obtainable, and freeze at once. The ice 
becomes lighter colored the more it is beiten. The 
lemon juice he'ps to brighten it. The grapes should 
not be scalded or cooked. 



no. 



Wild Plum Ice. 



As good in its turn as pineapple or lemon. The 
plums must not be cooked, however. 

1 pound of wi'd plums — ripe and sweet, red or 
yellow. 

1 pound of sugar. 

1 quart of water. 

4 whites of eggs. 

Mash the plums and sugar together in a bright 
pan, add the water and rub the pulp and pyrup 
through a strainer into a freezer. Freeze, add the 
the whipped whites and beat up as usual. It makes 
a cream-white ice, that may be colored with a liitle 
boiled red plum syrup or otherwise. 

Wild plum ice cream of sweet pl»«s may also be 
m^de by the directions given for pineapple ice 
cream. The flavor is very good. 

111. 

The cook wanted to make a tapioca custard ice 
but the appearance of it on the bill of fare both' red 
him He knew it was good, for sometime? the 
tapioca cup-custard had become half frozen where 
it was set in ice to get cold, and it was extremely rich. 
He knew there waq such a thing as iced pudding, 
but then it might be taken to mean only pudding 
iced over like cake, and besides iced pudding should 
be of two parts, cream and fruit. This was at a 
Sulphur Springs down in a warm State where they 
had ices of some port for dinner every day during 
three-fourths of the year, and two kinds on Sun- 
days, and the repeti'ions cf ice cream and lemon 
shetbet became extremely tiresome. So he con- 
cluded to put it on the bill of fare frozen tapioca 
pudding. But the people who ate the dinners were 
not tired of ices, and the eating of them had become 
a sort of habit, and to have left out the ices would 
have seemed as strange as to have left out coffee or 
bread. And when the young colonel, who was al 
ways ready to penetrate a witicism, remarked sig. 
n^ficantly that if there was one thing he did love it 
was ice cream, and if there was one thing he did 
despise it was cold pudding, everybody looked at 



the bill of fare, and the young ladies said, oh, dear! 
But the brig dier gener»l s^id he had half a mind 
to try it and see what frozei pudding wa', and the 
old lady said he needn't be a bit afraid for every- 
hing they made there was good. But while they 
were talking the judge, who was wanted at the 
courthruse a|ain,^had had Ms brcught in, and he 
spoke up and naid they couldn't fool him, it was ice 
cream. Then the young ladies said again how very, 
very ridiculous, and they might brirg them a little, 
please. And it ended badly, for through this un- 
wonted advertising of the article it gave out and 
there was not over half enough to go round. But, 
begging the judges pardon, it was not ice cream, 
now what was it ? 



ll!S. Frozen Tapioca Oustard. 



3 quarts of milk. 
20 ounces of suj?ar. 

6 or 7 ounces of tapioca 

2 ounces of butter. 
12 yolks or 8 whole eggs. 

Flav-ring. 

1 cupful of thick cream to whip in at last. 

The pearl tapioca is the most suitable. If the 
large grained sort is used crush it on th.e table with 
the rolling-pin and then sift away the dust. 

Steep the tapioca 2 hours in a quart of milk cold, 
but set it in a warm place. Boil the rest of the milk 
with the sugar in it, then add the steeped tapioca, 
cook for 15 minutes. Stir in the butter, then the 
beaten yolks and tal^e the custard immediately off 
the fire, cool, flavor with vanilla or lemon, and 
freeze like ice cream, and when ne%rly finished add 
the cup of cream whipped to a froth, and beat well. 



113. Frozen Bice Oustard. 

Same as the preceding. Wash 6 ounces of rice in 
several wafers and cook it in the milk. May be 
flavored with stick cinnamon. If m»de with rice 
previously cooked pass it tbrough a colander. 



114, Frozen Scgo Oustard. 



Same as the tapioca custard. Steep the sago \% 
cold milk first it will then cook in a few minutes. 



115. 



Apple Ice. 



To be served in co^nbination with a frozen custard 
such as the preceding three. 
20 ounces of cored and sliced apples. 
12 ounces of sugar. 
1 quart of water. 
1 lemon. 

Use for this pu''p''se only ripe and sweet apples. 
Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and a cupful of 
water and throw in the apple quarters or slices and

the lemon— ccver with a lid and simmer slowly till 
dene without stirring or breaking Strain out the 
af plf 8 find set them on ice. Add the balance of the 
water to the syrup and freeze it without much beat- 
ing, then throw in the apples and finish the freezing. 
Thi^ makes a whitish ice. The apples should not be 
trozen very hard. 



Frozen Compotes of Pears and Oranges. 



For the same purposes as the apples preceding, 
can be prepared in the same way. The object ( f 
stewing the fruit in thick eyrup is to prevent it from 
breaking out of shape. The syrup can then be dilu- 
ted as desired. 



The quantities in all these receipts are calculated 
for the average or probable orders of 60 j ersons 
having a varied bill of fare to cboose fiom. When 
two ices are to be served in combination the quan. 
tities of each of course are reduced in proportion 
A liberal rule is to provide a quart before freezing 
for every 10 persons, and the freezing process should 
increase its volume considerably. 



UT. 



Lemon Ice. 



8 lemons. 

3 pounds of sugar. 

3 quarts of water. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Grate the rinds of the lemons into a bowl ard 
squeeze in the juice. Make a boiling syrup of the 
sugar and half the water and pour it hot to the 
lemon zest and juice and let remain so till cold. 
Then add the rest of the water, strain the lemonade 
into a fieezer, freeze as usual, and at last add the 
whites whipped to a firm froth, beat and freeze ogain 
Tbe scalding draws the flavor of the lemon; it should 
never, however, be boiled and fewer lemons shou'd 
be used when they are large. The ice is perfectly 
white. 



118. 



Saratoga Ice Cups. 



For the following very easy method of serving 
ices ornamentally there should be provided a suffi 
cient number of tin drinking cups made like tall 
tumbler glasses, to serve as molds. They need have 
no rimmed edge. Their slight flexibility makes 
them better tha • gl sses «o get the shell of ice out 
of. The ccmmonest thin tumblers will answer how 
ever. 

Take 4 dozen tumblers and set them in a freezing 
mixture of ice p ucded extremely fine and well 
mixed with salt and a little brine from the freezing 
tub. The freezing mixture may be in a common 
washtub, or wooden box, and no deeper than the 
tumblers. Fill the glasses with thin strawberry, 
pineipple or lemon syrup, or with any of the prep- 
arations for fruit ices. Cover over the top of the 



tub with a table cloth and leave them to freeze. In 
from 15 to 30 minutes ihe glasses or moulds will 
have a coaling of ice inside perhfipa an eight h-of-an- 
inch thick. 3 he unfrozen syiup shoild then be 
poured out and the glasses returned to thf^ freezing 
mixture for the inside c ating of ice to freeze per- 
fectly drj and crystalized. The freezing mav be 
hastened by gently stirring the freezing mixture 
among the tumblers with a stick and by turning the 
tumblers with the fingers. 

When it is time to serve wipe the outside of the 
glass or mold with a cloth dipped in tepid water 
and turn out the shell of ice. Fill it with a curacao 
or caramel or nut ice cream or any ether of diflFer- 
ent color from the cup itself, or with a puie froth d 
cream swee'ened and flavored and frozen in the same 
ice cup set in a sorbetiere 

Different colored cups m«y be made with the green 
syrup of pounded muscatel grapes, with Concord 
grapes, cherries, etc. Observe that the less sugar 
these syrups contain the easier the cup shapes will be 
to freeze and the slower to dissolve. They last longer 
on the table than the ioe creams they are filled with. 

Ice cream in shape of eggs : A small number 
for a party table can be made without moulds by 
using egg shells of the largest sort. Procure some 
broad rubber bands from the stationers, such as are 
used for binding bundles of letter, etc , and half an 
inch in breadth Emp^y the eggshel's by making a 
hole at each end. Fill them with ice cream, aofi and 
just freshly frozen. Draw the rubber bands over 
them so as to close the holes, brush over with melted 
butter besides to close a'l crevices against the salt, 
them drop them in the freezing tub and cover with 
the finely pounded ice and salt. 

IIO. 

Surprise ices : A more elaborate form of the fore- 
going egg shapes. Fill the shells with a white ice 
cream only partly frozen and fluid, close with the 
rubber bands and butter and immerse them in the 
freezing mixture about 15 minutes for a shell of 
cream to form inside. Then wash off the outside, 
remove the bands, pour or scoop out the cream that 
remains unfrozen in the middle, and place the shells 
in a freezer well packed in ice and salt to freeze dry 
and crystalized, as already directed for ice cups. 
After that fill with chocolate ice. cream or yellow 
frozen custard. The variations are endless. 



130. Biscuit Ices or Ice Cakes. - 

i BISCUITS GLACES. 

Ices, extra sweet and lich, in little paper cases 
made to imitate cakes, sometimes with a brown crust 
on top as if baked. Very handsome little rice paper 
cases can now be procured for this and similar pur. 
poses. Fill them with any kind of ice or with a 
number of different varieties. There is no rule as 
to kinds but nut creams, caramel, chocolate and 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



strawberry ice creams, and the sponge ices to be 
mentioned further on, are the most suitable Smooth 
over, roll some macaroons to powder and sift that 
over to give the brown appearance, then place the 
ice biscuits in a freezing box to remain till time to 
serve. 



Small quantities of ice creams, etc., for biscuits 
glaces and for lining a mold, can be frozen wi'hout 
the trouble of the regular packing of a freezer for 
each Vind in any sort of deep tin vessel set in a tub 
of ice and salt, by rapid stirring with a spoon or 
paddle while the vessel is tept in motion with the 
other hand. A quart in each can generally be fro- 
zen in 10 or 15 minutes. 



Ices for biscuits glaces that are made with 1 pound 
or IJ pounds of sugar to a quart have a glossy ap- 
pearance when well worked and draw from the 
spoon like pulled candy. 

131. 

A freezing I ox: It is a simple and ea«y matter to 
freeze ice crei>m in a mold that can have the Id pu 
on, be sealed and dropped into (he freeziag tub fropa 
which the ice cream freezer has just been removed. 
A freezing box involving the use of a larger amount 
of freezit g material is, however, indisprnsablfi for 
some articles. An empty ice cream freezer with the 
lid on, picked around and on top wish ice and salt, 
is an example of what is wanted. A glass of cream 
placed inside might be frozen solid in an hour cr 
two. But something more spacious can generally be 
improvised, f uch as a bro^d and shallow boi'er set 
in a tub. The article must have a lid that will ad- 
mit of ice and salt being packed all over it without 
danger to the contents. 



"Now I have lived long enough to know that each 
generation says the same thing, and is laughed at 
f( r its pains by the generation fullowing." — Savarin 
Preface. 



We have adhered closely to one of the highest 
piiociples of the best cook which the present ege, or 
perhaps that of Heliogabalus hath produced. This 
grcit man, as is well known to all lovers of polite 
eating, begios at first by setting plain things before 
his hungry guests, using afterwards by degrees, as 
their s omacUs may be supposed to decrease, to the 
very qsintessence of sauce and spices. By these 
mears we duubt not but our reader may be rendered 
desirous to read on forever, as the great person just 
above mentioned i<j supposed to have made persons 
to eat." — Fielding — Preface to Tom Jones — 1751. 

"There is no doubt the delicacy of cur manners 
could not suffer the Roman practice cf using vomi- 
tories, but we have done better, and reach the same 



end by a method allowed by good taste. Wo have 
invented dishes fo attractive that they unceasingly 
renew the appetite ; yet they are at the same time 
so light that they flatter the palate without loading 
the stomach. We have arrived at such a point, that 
if the calls of business did not force us to riee from 
the table, or the want of sleep interpose, the dura- 
tion of our repasts would be almost unlimited; and 
there would be no fixed data for finding what time 
might elapse between the first glass of Madeira and 
the last tumbler of punch." — Oastronomy — 1825. 



"Although this kind of ice is seldom served I have 
thought it best to describe it ; it is just possible 
that, in (his transition period, we mny see an a'- 
tempt made to improve the indiflfeverit quali y of 
the refreshments now served at evening parties ; and 
then such delicate preparations as these Iced Froths 
will be in request. They are cool to eat without 
freezing the palatr; they are perfectly whoiesome and 
suited to the weakest digestion." — Jules Qouffe 
—1865. 



*'Even if we do the same things as the ancients 
did, we do them in a different manner." — SavarMa

Iced Froths. 



MOUSSES GLACEES. 



These ices often appear in the menus of banquet^ 
served at Delmonico's They are whipped creami 
variously flavored; the froth is piled in glasse;} 
which are then set in a freezing box where it is al- 
lowed to freeze without any minipulation. Double 
cream must be used; that is cream skimmed fronj 
the top of cresm. It should be cold to froth easily. 
Sweeten and flavor it like any ice cream preparation, 
and churn it in a pail with a whip churn, such %% 
may be procured at any tinners, or with a Dovei 
egg bearer in a shallow bowl; take off the froth, 
place it on a fine seive to drain, and when all ia 
whipped firm pile it in the glasses it is to be frozen 
and served in. 

Maraschino, chocolate, coffee, strawberry, lemon 
and vanil'a creams are suitable but need to be more 
highly flavored than the ordinary ices. 

It will be found a great aid if all the operations 
can be performed in a cold place. 

For the pastry cook who makes sponge cake fre* 
quently, it will remove the abtrusenesa from two or 
three examples following to observe that they are 
nearly the same as lady-finger batter before the flouf 
is added.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



Vienna Glaoe Biscuit, or Ice Cake. 

153. 

1 pouud of sugar. 

1 email cup of water— nearly J pint. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

1 pint of double cream. 

2 tablespoonfula of vanilla extract. 

Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and water. Beat 
the yor^s light in a deep bowl, pour the boiling syr- 
up to them and continue beating, with the bowl set 
in ice water, till the mixture is cold and very light. 
Whip the cream to froth and lightly mix it with the 
other, and add the flavoring. Sift powdered maca- 
roon over the rice paper cases, nearly fiil them with 
the preparation, powder over the tops and set the 
biscuits in the freezing case for 2 or 3 hours. 

The practice so common in Italian and French 
cookery of using syrups of varying density instead 
of sugar in making numerous other articles, as well 
as their especial varieties of cakes, is a remnant 
of ancient times, for the Italians and the French 
were fine cooks long before the art of making dry 
crystalized sugar was kaown. Th-^y used syrups 
and honey,and the handicraft transmitted from father 
to son has not been wholly revolutionized by the 
newer product. 

Spongada, Fromasre Glace, or Sponge 

154. Ice. 



Sort of frozen '* Tom and Jerry "—needs no milk 
or cream. 
24 yolks of eggs. 

6 whites of eggs. 

2 pounds of sugar, 

1 pint of water. 

1 pint of kirschenwasser, or half as much maras- 
chino, curacoa, or a little peach brandy. 

Make a boiling syrup of the sugar and wa'er and 
pour it to the yolks previously beaten light. Beat the 
mixture till cool, pour it into a freezer and con'ioue 
beating with the wire egg whisk, turning the freezer 
with the other hand, till it is pretty well frozen, 
then add the liqueur a little at a time, and then 
the whites of eggs whipped firm. It looks like a 
very spongy cake. Can be be put in paper cases 
large or small, or filled in a frozen charlotte. 

An'>ther variety of the foregoing may be made by 
freezing 2 quarts of syrup with chocolate dissolved 
in if, and when nearly finished add 12 whites of eggs 
whipped light, and beating all together. 

The receipt for glace a la cremi Napolitaine origi- 
nally promulgated by M. M. Bernard and Urbain- 
Dubois from the royal palace at Vienna, perhaps 
some thirty years ago, had no reference to the brick 
shape of tri-colored ices of the present fashion. It 



was — 3 decil de creme doublo, trois quarts de litre 
de sirop a 25 dsg., 15 jaunes d'oeufs, 1 orange zeste 
— approximately a pint of double cream, a pound of 
sugar and a half a pint of wa^er, 15 yolks, and (r 
ange flavor,concocted together by the Italian method, 
i. e. the boiling syrup poured <o the yolks, and the 
mixture be- ten up like sponge cake batter, the 
whipped cream incorporated with it, and the liijbt 
product frozen quickly. 

135. 

Neapolitan molds : These are in the form of a cigar 
box or briok ; can be made much longer if desired. 
If ordered from a tinner have ihem made wih two 
bids and no bottom instead of box-like wiih one lid ; 
let the rim of the lids have thick wire soldered on 
to rest upon another wire soMered on the box — 
much the same as ice cream freezer lids are made. 

Neapolitan is the English word, Napolitaine is the 
French. These are among the words that break us 
all up with our bills of fare. 



ISO. Neapolitan Ices or Ice Cream. 



Prepare three ice creams, or creams and fruit ices 
or spoi ge ices, of different colors and flavors, and 
fill the mold (already made freezing cold) with them 
in equal layers. This is best done by filling ono 
of the lids higher than its rim and leveling it off, 
then pushing the mold down into it and then adding 
the other two layers as evenly as possible. Put on 
the top lid, draw half a dozen rubber bands around 
each mold to keep the lids in place, fill the inter- 
stices with butter and then place the molds in the 
freezing tub and cover them with pounded iceand salt. 
Let them remoin 2 or 3 hours to harden. Some re- 
gard should be had to the compatibility of flavors 
chosen as, for instance, lemon and chccolate do not 
taste well together, but chocolate and cinnamon and 
vanil a do, and an almond flavored caramel cream is 
suitable with red grape and white cherry ices. 

Ices are said to have been introduced into France 
from Italy by Catherine de Medici. 



Italian Fruit 
1ST. 



Ice Cream or Iced Plum 
Pudding. 



TUTTI FRUTTFf 

Make a quart of rich yolk-of-egg custard, color it 
cafe-au-lait wiih two ounces of sugar burnt to mola«- 
ses color and dissolved in milk, flavor with a quarter 
pint of curacoa, strain, freeze and boat up thoroughly. 

Fill a quart measure with a mixture of different 
kinds of sugared fruits, candied dates, preserved 
wa'er melon rind, candied citron, seedless raisins 
previously steeped in a liqueur, figs cut in pieces, 
some blanched almonds or ^nything^ of the sort that 
is good. Mix these fruUs with the frozen custard 
and pack down with ice and salt to remain while 
you prepare the molds. 



THE AMERICAN PASTBY COOK. 



Make also 2 quarts of orange ice in another freezer, 
add the white of eggs in the usual manner and beat it 
up whife ai'd smooth, then spread it evenly over the 
insides of 2 or 3 melon molds to coat them. Imbed 
ihe molds in the freezing mixture and when the coat- 
ing of orange ice is frozen firm fill up with the tutti 
frutM. Spread the orange ice also on top, put on 
the lids, secure with a number of rubber bands; 
close all spaces securely with butter and place the 
molds in the freezing mixture to remain 2 or 3 hours. 

When to be served wash the outsides with a cloth 
dipped in tepiJ water, carefully turn out the tutti 
frutti ou to a folded napkin on a dish, lay a decora- 
tion of gelatine paste upon the white surface and 
serve. 

Or it can be served individually in slines the 
same as Neapolitan ices. 

Nearly all ice cream molds, except the half melon 
shape, require a lid at each end because the pressure 
of air renders it difl&cult to withdraw the icei from 
a tall shape tightly soldered at the top. 



Gelatine Paste for Ornamenting loes 
138. 

Make clear jelly in the usual manner, then reduce 
it by slow boiling to little more than half, color it as 
desired, filter again, flavor, and cool it on large plat- 
ters. S'amp out leaves, fern leaves, flower shapes, 
etc , and have them ready to place on the molded 
ices as soon as they are turned out. 



There are few terms of more uncertain meaning 
than the word sherbet. At first perhaps a simple 
beverage of sweet fruit juice mixed with water and 
cooled with a handful of mountain snow, it has 
come to stand for anything from flavored sugar and 
water and lemonade to frozen champagne punch. 



1^9. 



London Sherbet. 



3 pints of water. 

1^ pints of wine — port or any sweet kind. 
2 pounds of sugar. 

4 t ranges. 
2 lemons. 

8 ounces of sultana seedless raisins. 
8 whiles of eggs. 
Nutm<»g. Red fruit juice or other coloring. 
Make a sjrup of the sugar and water and pour it 

hot upon the oranges and lemons all cut up in a 
bowl, and the raisins and half a nutmeg with them. 
When cool strain the syrup into a freezer, add the 
wine and coloring to make it pink, and freeze and 
beat up with the whites of eggs as usual. Add the 
fruit slicea at last and mix them in without break- 
i'>g. Only good thin-skinned fruit can be used this 
way. Exclude the seeds lest the sherbet be bitter. 



130. 



Turkish Sherbet. 



1 quart of port or any sweet wine. 

1 quart of water. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

2 lemons — juice only. 

6 oranges— juice only. 

8 ounces of blanched almonds. 

8 ounces of musca'el grapes. 

4 ounces of figs cut small. 

4 ounces of seedless raisins. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Cloves and cinnamon, and little coloring. 

Make a hot syrup of the sugar and water and 
pour it over the raisins and figs and 6 cloves and a 
small piece of cinnamon in a b )wl. When cool color 
pink, add the orange and lemon juice and wine, 
strain, and freeze it in the usual manner. Take out 
the spices and add the scalded raisins and figs and 
the grapes and almonds to the sherbet at last. 



Collet, a French captain and refugee, made a small 
fortune in New York about the year 1816 by making 
ices and sherbets. 8&jb the Chronicler: "The women 
in particular, never tired of this new pleasure, be- 
ing especially astonished that they could be kept so 
cold at a summer heat of ninety degrees." 



If sherbets have any distinguishing feature in 
their composition at all it is the admixture of jelly, 
either calf's foot or gelatine, recommended by some 
to give smoothness to the drink and substance to 
the ice Mention has already been made of gela- 
tine in ice cream. Either gelatine dissolved or fin- 
ished table jelly can be added at option to the Eher- 
bets preceding, but in that case leave out the whites 
of eggs which are the substitute for calf's foot jvl-y. 



According the lexicographers the word punch is 
derived from East Indian pantsh, five, having refer- 
ence to the five ingredients of punch — water, spirit, 
sugar, lemons and tea. But that is the old-fashioned 
punch to be drunk hot. 

131. 

Roman punch is essentially a strong and good 
lemonade with rum in it and whipped whites of 
egg?, and frozen. But almost every one adds to it 
orange juice, wine or brandy or maraschino and 
sometimes spices and flavors. These are not essen- 
tial ingredients but only individual fancies, but it 
results that there is nothing that cooks in hotels 
have to make that there are such various ideas 
about as the composition of Roman punch. Ag in, 
the caterers who have had the privilege of setting 
the fashions make other punches "a U Romaicp," 
which are not Roman punch but are made in ' he 
same manner with white of egg«, or Italian mer- 
ingue, (which is boiled icing and acts the same as 
the whites) and frozen. Rum punch becomes Ro* 



86 



THE AlttEBICAN PASTRY COOK. 



man punch by being put through the process just 
mentioned. The places where Roman punch, or 
something that passes for it is served wiih the des- 
sert in place of ice cream are far more numerous 
than where it is served as a course between the en 
trees and the game. 



139. 



Boman Punoh. 



2 pounds of sugar. 
8 pints of water. 

6 or 6 lemons — -juice of all, zest of 3. 

3 or 4 orangf 8— juice of all, zest of 1. 
8 whites of eggs. 

Half pint of Jamaica rum. 

Half pint of angelica or other sweet wine. 

Grate the rinds of 3 or 4 of the lemons and 1 or 
2 oranges, according to their size and ripeness, into 
a bowl and squeeze in the juice of all without the 
seeds. Make a hot syrup of the sugar and a pint of 
water, and when it has cooled a little pour it to the 
zests and juice, and let remain till cold. Add the 
wine and the other two pints of water, strain into 
a freezer, freeze, add the whipped whites, and a 
few minutes before serving put in the rum and beat 
to mix. 

2. To make a more expensive quality of punch 
use good French white wine instead of water, ex- 
oept water enough to dissolve the sugar. Rub the 
orange and lemon zests on lumps of sugar and the 
flavored syrup made with it need not be made hot. 
A larger number of lemons will be needed, and the 
rum is to be added at last as in the other case. 



133. 



Russian Punoh. 



1 quart of black tea made as for drinking, (1 oz. 
in a quart of water.) 

1 pint of water. 

1 pint of port wine. 

Half pint of brandy. 

1| pounds of sugar. 

3 lemons. 

Little caramel to color. 

Cut the lemons in small slices in a bowl, make a 
boiling syrup of the sugar and water and pour over 
them and let stand till cold. Then add the tea and 
liquors and strain the punch into a freezer and 
freeze as hard as the spirit in it will allow. Keep 
the lemon slices on ice and mix them in the frozen 
punch at last. This should be light ale colored. 
Use carmel if necessary. 



134. Maraschino Punoh. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

3 pints of water. 

2 lemons- juice only, 
2 oranges — juice only. 
1 pint of maraschino. 
6 whites of eggs. 



Mix the sugar and water and juice of fruits to 
gcther, strain, freeze, add the whipped whites and 
beat up. 



135. 



Strawberry Punoh. 



Prepare strawberry syrup as directed for straw- 
berry ice and add to it a pint of sweet wine and 
freeze. Color bright rose. 



130. 



Imperial Punoh. 



2 pounds of sugar. 

3 pints of water. 
1 ripe pineapple. 

4 oranges — juice of all, zest of 2. 
4 lemons — ^juice of all, zest of 2. 
1 nutmeg. 

8 whites of eggs. 

1 pint of equal parts of maraschino, noyeau, 
kirscb, and curacao. 

1 pint of champagne. 

Grate or mash the pineapple, add the zests and 
juice of the lemons and oranges and pour on them 
the hot sjrup made of the sugar and water. Let 
stand till cold Then strain and pres3 the syrup 
from the pineapple, freeze and add the whipped 
whites as usual, and a little while before serving add 
the liqueurs and champagne. 



13T. 



Kisses. 



Not dictionary kisses. Unfortunately perhaps for 
the succintness of the following disquisition the die 
tionaries describe another kind of kisses which in 
some people's minds may possibly intrude and get 
mixed up with these. But they ought not, for it is 
not likely that the two varieties have any qualities 
in common. These kisses that we are going to tell 
you how to make are soft, tender, sweet, fragile, 
round, plump, smooth, delicate, nice, light, and they 
are hollow. That is to say, they should be so if per- 
fectly well made, but some people go on trying all 
their lives and never prodi ce a perfect kiss. On 
second thoughts, for fear of the idea of the diction- 
ary kiss perhaps we had better call these trifles by 
their Freuch names. And you may find one of them 
if you will look in Mr. Thackeray's book, Pendenms. 
It must be about the middle of the first volume and 
can easily be found because the French words are in 
italics. Mr. P. comes to Clivering Hall and he 
finds the Claveri' gs' young-one sittiag on the carpet 
with his Uce smeared all over *'with the species of 
lather contained in the confec'ion called meringues a 
la creme." That is one sort. Those are our egg 
kisses filled with whipped cream. So of course they 
have to be made hollow, and few beside first rate 
workmen can make them so. But there are numer- 
ous varietias of the kiss-meringue, and they that can 
make them are generally proud of their knowledge* 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK.

Now plenty of people will make cake icing and drop 
lumps of it on pans or on paper and bake them and 
call them kisses or meringues ; hard, rough and 
cracked open little lumps of sugar as Ihey are, 
and many a country baker exhibits the same thing 
in his window, never seeming to know that there is 
a trick and touch beyond that, with the same mate- 
rial, that makes the meringue swell and round itself 
like the top of a mushroom, into a shell as thin as 
paper — the meringues and finger macaroons of the 
fine con fee ionaries. There are measures and rules 
for these, and the finest are easy enough when one 
knows how. 

These are trifles of course not to be compared with 
the importance of making good bread and puddings, 
yet if one makes such "pretties" at ail they should 
be in the highest degree excellent. We have found 
oral instructions always useless to the many who have 
tried to make fine meringues. The cook-books give 
a dry formula and leave you to hit or miss as it may 
hippen. Therefore we shall be particular to explain 
all the trick there is about them, belie-ving that at 
any rate printed words may be quite as good as 
actual examples for intelligent readers, who can refer 
to them again if necessary. 



138. 



Meringue Paste- 



This in various forms has had to be mentioned 
often in these columns. It is always white of egg 
and sugar, but is sometimes soft meringue as on 
lemon pies, and sometimes nearly all sugar as in 
cake icing and ^'kisses." « 



130. Meringues a la Creme. 



These are made in two different ways, the first 
makes perhaps the finest and smoothest glazed mer- 
ingue resembling frosted glass, but the paste must 
be used immediately as it soon becomes too thin to 
keep shape. 

1 pound of powdered sugar. 
10 whites of eggf. 

1 or 2 teaspoonfu's oT flavoring extract. 

Have everything cold and dry to begin with. Whip 
the white of eggs in a deep bowl with a whisk made 
of a bunch of wires, till it will not fall out when 
turned upside down, add the sugar and flavoring all 
at once and stir it in just enough to mix it well and 
no more. Have ready some strips of writing paper 
two inches wide and pieces of boards (not pine) to 
bake the meringues on. Place spoonfuls egg- 
shaped on the strips of paper, not too close, smooth 
them with a knife, sift powdered sugar all over them, 
shake oflF the surplus, place the strips on the boards 
and dry-bake them with the oven door partly open. 
They need tp bake nearly or quite half an hour. 



They can be lifted oflF the paper when cold. Tha 
boards prevent a crust forming on the bottom and 
the soft remainder inside can be scooped out. Fill 
as directed in the next receipt. 

140. 

Meringue Puffs— An Easier Way. 



1 pound of granulated sugar. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Flavoring extract. 

8 drops of acetic acid, or a pinch of tartaric, or a 
little lemon juice. 

Put half the whites in a bowl without beating, 
and all the sugar with them and beat together with 
a wooden spoon or paddle. It may save half the 
labor and insures success to have all the utensils and 
ingredients quite cold to begin with. It quickens 
the process if the beating can be done with two pad- 
dles, using both hands as regular workmen do. The 
bowl should be a deep one holding two quarts. 

The sugar and egg at first are as stifi" as dough. 
Beat rapidly and constantly for about 16 minutes, 
when it should be white and rather firm cake icing. 
Now add the remaining 4 whites of egg, one at a 
time, and beat a few minutes between each one, but 
before the last one is added put in the acid and 
the flavoring. 

The whole time of beating is about 25 minutes. 
An essential point is to beat the icing after the addi- 
tion of each white until it will again draw up in 
peaks after the paddle is lifted from it, except the 
last white which should not be beaten much as it 
forms the gloss and smoothness on the meringues 
when they are baked. 

Drop this meringue paste in egg shapes on baking 
pani instead of on paper as in the last receipt, and 
these being made with granulated sugar instead of 
powdered do not need any Eugar sifted over, they 
look better without. 

Bake in a very slow oven till pale straw color and 
dry. They slip from the pans easily when cold. 

Cut out the thin bottom crusts with a penknife* 
and fill the meringues with whipped cream sweet, 
ened and flavored, or with wine jelly, and either 
place two together by the bottoms or join them 
two together side by side with melted candy 
or icing, like an open walnut shell, and pile wipped 
cream or chopped jelly upon them. These mer- 
ingues likewise look well singly as cups filled with 
bright jellies of different colors and with ice creams. 



Instead of placing the meringue paste on the pans 
with spoon and knife it is much better to use the 
sack and tube, such as lady-fingers are made with 
— a funnel shaped canvas bag with a tin tube in the 
pointed end, the tube about J inch in diameter at 
the narrow end for these. Fill the sack with the 
paste and press it out in the size and shape desired. 



Sb 



THE AMERICAN PASTBT OOOK. 



141. Rose Meringue Pufife. 

Hiving made the meringue paste according to the 
preceding directions, color it, or a part of it, of a 
delicale pink and flavor with rose extract. Drop 
with the sack and tube pieces like large marbles on 
baking pans previously greased and then vfiped dry, 
and bake slowly without color. These rise rounded 
and nearly hollow and have a gauzy appearance 
when rightly baked. 

Sometimes the first panful of any of these varie- 
ties put into the range will run together and melt 
and come out worthless, and the next come out 
perfect meringues, or one side of a pan will be 
spoiled and the remainder good. This shows that 
the baking is the critical part of the making, and 
that is what we never can teach by word of mouth. 
At a certain gentle heat the egg in the meringues 
cooks and dries in shape, but at a higher degree the 
sugar melts and runs to candy in bubbles. A.t an 
insufficient degree of heat the meringue dries as it 
would in the sun and does not swell and change its 
appearance. In the brick oven after the bread has 
been withdrawn is the proper place to bake mer- 
ingues. 

143. Chocolate Merinarue Puffs. 



There is nothing of the kind choicer or more 
fragile than these. Only a slight change in the 
ingredients from the foregoing varieties. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 
6 whites of eggs. 

3 ounces of grated common chocolate — a heaping 
cupful 
3 drops of acetic acid. 

2 teaspoonfula of vanilla extract. 

Beat up the icing as directed for meringue puflFs, 
using 6 whites instead of 8, and when it is finished 
mix in the chocolate thoroughly. Drop round por- 
tions with the sack and tube on baking pans and 
bake at a very gentle heat These rise rounded 
like a mushroom, and nearly hollow. They slip 
from the pans ea-ily when cold. 



143. Almond Meringue Puffe. 

Take some of the white icing as made for mer- 
ingue puffs, drop round portions like large marbles 
01 baking pans and stick 5 or 6 halves of almonds 
that have been blanched and split, in each one, in 
circular order, and bake carefully. 

144. Oocoanut Macaroons. 



Make the white ising or meringue paste as directed 
for meringue puffs and add to it when finished 8 
ounces of desiccated cocoanut. Drop pieces size of 
walnu 8 v.ith a spoon and knife point, on greased 
baking pans and bake in a very slack oven. These 



favorites for the cake baskets. The sugared kind 
of desiccated cocoanut is the best to use. Care 
should be taken to have the icing well made a d 
firm before adding it, for no additions of flour or 
starch will do any good if the icing is inclined to 
run in the first place. And too much care cannot 
be taken with the baking. Let the macaroons re- 
main on the pans till cold. 

145. Almond Rings and Fingers. 

Make the same as the preceding with 8 ounces of 
blanched almonds minced very small. Put a smaller 
tube in the forcing sack, and form finger shapes and 
rings of the almond meringue paste on baking pans, 
and bake them in a very slack oven. These all bake 
light and nearly hollow and have a fine glazed sur. 
face. 



The foregoing varieties, which can all be made 
out of one large bowl of meringue paste, form a hand- 
some assortment for the cake stands, to build pyra- 
mids, to place around glass bowls of fruit, to deco- 
rate cakes and to fill icing or nougat baskets with. 



146. 



Common Macaroons. 



12 ounces of almonds. 

8 ounces of granulated sugar. 

4 ounces of flour. 

4 eggs. Pinch of salt. 

Crush the almonds without taking off the skins, 
with a rolling-pin upon the table. Mix them and 
the sugar and flour together in a bowl. Drop the 
eggs in the middle and mix the whole into a rather 
soft dough. Place in lumps size of cherries on 
baking pans very slightly greased. Bake in a slack 
oven light brown. A few bitter almonds or peach 
kernels mixed in improves them. 



147. Meringue Cakes in General. 

Make white icing or meringue paste according to 
directions in preceding articles and add two more 
whites to thin it Color some of it and leave some 
white. Spread it over sheets of any sort of cake, or 
on small cakes and bake in a very slack oven with 
something under the cakes to keep them from too 
much baking at bottom. Granulated sugar may be 
sifted over the top before baking, or colored sugar 
sand on the white. 

148. About Eggs and Egg Beating. 



One of the very first cook-books I ever picked up 
cautioned the reader not to stop beating the eggs 
that were once commenced, because they would go 
down "and no human power can whip them up 
light again." The statement is altogether erroneous 
and a very mischievous one for the clats of learners 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



who are always seeking excuses for bad work. And 
it went on to say, "and sometimes they cannot be 
whipped to perfect lightness at all In that case 
you should procure some fresher eggs," eto. 

Hotel work admi-s of no apologies, and when the 
steward and cooks plan the dinner thpy cannot afford 
to mvte the appearance of a dish contingent upon 
the caprice of a di zen of eggs, whether they will 
choose to come up light or not. 

The ease or difflcu'ty cf beating up eggs, mpringvie, 
icing, sponge cake snd the rest depends upon the 
degree of deufity or viscidity ( f the f g?s rr the white 
of eggs, and tha^ often depends upon the tempera- 
ture; they are thicker when c Id, and when x;arm 
the white of eggs sometimes becomes so tbin as to 
have no more power t > hold the air bubbles beaten 
into it than so much water. 

Only last winter a man who had worked with me 
was boarding at a small hotel and h^ippened in the 
bar room when some men who couldn't were try- 
ing to beat up the eggs for the Chri^tra^is egg nogg. 
Tfapy had the eggs in a tin pail and eat by the stove 
taking spells with each other and beating for all 
that was out, without the least sign of success. As 
soon as the man saw what was the matter he took 
the pail, went outride and set it on the snow, and 
in ten minutes h d succeeded in converting the 
eggs into a pailful of foam, and the men who couldo't 
allowed that it was a little trick worth knowing. 

Sometimes the eggs can be beaten up quite as 
easily when warm, bat thit is when they have lost 
part of the wa^er they contain by evaporation, as 
even ep'gs in the 8h?ll wi'l do in dry weather, and 
thus become as thick as if made cold. 



149. 



Dried Eggs. 



White of eggs poured thinly on platters soon 
evaporates and becomes a powder like pulverized 
glass. This is easily soluble, even to the touch of a 
moist finger, can be kept a long time dry and then 
dissolved in water and used as well as fresh. If the 
powder ( btained from two cups of white of eggs be 
diasolved in only one cup of water it can be beaten 
to fioth for icing, etc., in a minute or two whether 
warm or cold. That is the result of condensation 
The yolks of eggs dried alone are not soluble bu^ 
the entire egg beaten together and dried slowly in 
wUer, and mors npid.y if mixed with sugar before 
drying. 

150. 

The varieties of macaroons "kisses" and meringues 

that might be given would fill several columns, but 
there is no need Scores of things of this class 
with imposing names are but the variations played 
upon the foundation of a few simple and well known 
combinations. Any one who has made perfectly the 
few vaiieies we have described can easily discover 
new changes for himself. The proportion of minced 



almonds in the white macaroons may be doubled ; 
meringues baked on boards may be made extremely 
email, placed two together with a spot of apricot 
Jam inclosed ; some may be dredged while still moist 
before baking with chopped pistachio nurs, etc., etc. 
These things are not needed by name to vary the 
hotel bill of fare as some other things that we have 
to do with are, but are always bunched together as 
assorted cakes, small cakes or cakes and confection- 
eries. The following summary will have meaning 
for those who may have essayed the making of 
meringues a la creme, or macaroons, and failed. 

1 pound of sugar and 4 whites of eggs beaten 
with a paddle till light — about ^ an hour — makes a 
stiff cake icing and bakes hard and solid in the shape 
it is dropped on the pan. 1 pound of sugar and 6 
whites makes soft or finishifig icing, and bakes in 
meringues that are partly hollow but still dry and 
hard, rattling together like walnuts. 1 pound and 
8 whites makes the thin and fragile meringue we 
have described and the finer qualities of macaroons, 
and when the paste beats up easily, as is the case 
when the conditions are right, another white may be 
added with advantage. 

For twelve whites to a pound whip the whites with 
a wire egg whisk at first. 

The acetic acid should be added to the icicg only 
when it is nearly finished. Its effect in whitening 
and stiffening the icing will be seen at once. 

The common trouble in making icing or meringue 
paste is its tendency to run out of shape and drip off 
the cakes covered with it. This cannot be remedied 
by the addition of more sugar, which indeed only 
increases the trouble, but must be prevented by care 
in the beginning, by having the ingredients cold and 
not damp and by using enough sugar to the eggs at 
starting to make a stiff dough that can hardly be 
stirred, but will get thinner as the sugar dissolves, 
and the beating done must be rapid beating, not 
stirring around. Granulated sugar can be made into 
meringues or icing with more ease and certainty 
than powdered sugar. 

The annexed are candies but match well the mer- 
ingues and macaroons, with the drawback, however, 
of being solid sugar and costlier, for their size than 
the articles of their list. These caramels sell well in 
the shops. 



Oocoanut Caramels, White and Red. 

151. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 

8 ounces of desiccated cocoanut. 

A small half cupful of water. 

Coloring. 

Set the sugar and water over the fire in a small 
bright kettle and boil about 5 minues, or till the 
pyrup bubbles up thick and ropes from the spoon, 
and do not stir it. Then put in the oocoanut, stir to 



40 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



mix, and begin at once and drop the candy by table 
spoonfuls on a buttered baking pan. Reserve a few 
spoonfuls, make it hot again and color with cochineal 
and thin with a spoonful of water. Drop a spot of 
the red on each of the white caramels. Should the 
candy become set in the kettle before all is used it 
may be dissolved by adding a spoonful of water and 
setting it on the range again. When fresh grated 
cocoanut is used the sugar needs to be boiled to the 
candy point, or 3 or 4 minutes longer. 



The yolk of an egg may be mixed with a portion 
of the ^andy instead of red coloring as above to 
make a yellow color, and melted chocolate added for 
another variety. 

15S. 

We set out white cakes, fruit cakes, pound and 

yeast raised cakes, but if we may judge by the cri 
terion of the quantity used where people have free 
choice, sponge cake and the numerous varieties 
from the same mixture, all made without butter, 
hold the first place as favorites. Italian cakes is the 
general term for the class ; diet- bread cake is the 
fanciful name for sponge cake sometimes found in 
old-time cook-books. The loaf cakes of this sort* 
whether large or small, are not so good when stale, 
and in some large confectionaries having reputations 
to keep up, it is made a rule never to sell any over 
a day old over the counter, but such stock is disposed 
of at a reduced rate to small dealers. 

The good quality ol all these varieties depends 
upon the same precautions being observed as in the 
case of meringues and macaroons, just fully ex- 
plained in the preceding columns. 

153. 

Lady Fingers or Naples Biscuits. 

8 ounces of powdered sugar. 
Quarter cupful of water — J gill. 

9 eggs. 

10 ounces of flour. 

Separate the eggs, the whites from the yolks, and 
set the whites on ice in a large bowl. Have the 
flour also in a cold place. 

Put the sugar and water in a deep bright saucepan 
over the fire, add the yolks of the eggs and beat 
with a wire egg whisk till the mixture is warm but 
not hot — 5 minutes. Then set the saucepan in a 
pan of cold water, and continue beating 15 minutes 
more till the mixture is become cold, thick and 
whitish and twice its original bulk. Whip the whites 
to a firm froth that will not fall out of the bowl up- 
side down, and mix them lightly with the other and 
then stir in the flour, also without beating, and only 
stirred with a spoon suflBciently to hide it from 
tight. 



The above receipt is well worth learning as it is 
good for a great variety of Italian cakes and will 
not have to be repealed here, except as we shall 
show another v\ay of doing the same thing. 



To form the lady.fingers put some of the batter 
into the forcing sack having a tin tube in it from a 
quarter to half an inch in diameter, and force it out 
in finger lengths on sheets of blank paper, with an 
inch of space between each one Sift powdered 
sugar plentifully all over them. Take hold of two 
corners of the sheet of paper (which may be of half 
newspaper size) and shake off the surplus sugar on 
to the table, and lay the sheet of cakes on a baking 
pan placed readyt Bake 8 or 10 minutes in a mod- 
etate oven, allowing the cakes to become no more 
than deep straw color. 

To get the lady-fingers off the paper it is necessary 
to lay the sheet, cakes downwards, on a table and 
brush the paper over with water. The cakes will 
thea peel off. Place them two together. The mois- 
ture will cause them to adhere. 

154. 

Assorted Italian Oakes— Six Ways. 

1. Sponge drops: Proceed as for lady- fingers and 
drop the batter on paper in round shape, large or 
small; according to fancy. 

2. Place fiat sponge drops by twos together with 
jelly spread between, or lemon or orange paste. 

3. Have ready a lot of sponge drops. Make two 
or more colors and flavors of boiled icing or glaze, 
(directions for making which have already been 
given,) and dip the bottom of each cake, holding it 
on a fork, then set the cakes on baking pans to dry. 

4. Instead of dipping the bottoms let the tops of 
the sponge drops receive the icing, and when dry 
place them by twos together of different colors of 
glaze with yellow orange paste or conserve between 
them. 

5. Have some finely minced almonds, pistachios, 
hickory nuts, or desiccated cocoanut ready and mix 
with the batter after the manner of macaroons and 
dredge granulated sugar over the cakes instead of 
powdered before baking. 

6. Instead of mixing the minced almonds in the 
batter mingle powdered sugar with it and dredge it 
over the moist tops of the cakes before baking. 

155. 

Small Savoy Oakes or Savoy Biscuits. 

Make the same batter as for lady-fingers and 
flavor it with vanilla. Bake it either in small paper 
ca? es made oi writing paper, or in jem or patty pans 
fastened together by the dozen. Prepare the cases 
or pans by brushing them over with clear melted 
butler and shaking powdered sugar about in them 
instead of flour as with other cake3, and sift powd- 
ered sugar over the tops of the cakes before baking. 
These cakes bake quickly and should be light col- 
ored. 

156. Savoy Cake, Large. 

The same as the preceding, baked in a large or 
fancy shaped mold coated with powdered sugar; 
powdered sugar also sifted on top of the cake form- 
ing a glazed surface when baked. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



41 



When we come to examine thoroughly the most 
authoritative, the most noted and the cos'liest works 
on cookery extant, and to sift their methods and 
directions in the full light of a lifetime's working 
experience in ord r to discover the simple princi- 
ples that mu««t underlie every successful method a 
good deal is revealed that looks like charlatanry and 
owlish pretense. 

In this little matter of Italian cakes, to look at 
the imposing lists of varieties, each with its name, 
its own set of weights and proportions and mode of 
procjdure, one would think it would take about a 
century to learn them all, but when we know in ad- 
vance that every one must rest upon the simple 
sponge cake mixture however well disguised we are 
acquainted with (he whole of them already. The 
standard sponge cake mixture, as it may fairly be 
called, is 1 pound of sugar, 12 eggs and 12 ou ces 
of flour. The nature of the ingredients will not 
admit of a deviation of over an ounce or two. But 
if in writing a receipt we designate say three-fifths 
of Ihese proportions cf each article, and for the next 
variety two-fifths or two-thirds or one-half, the only 
difference in result will be in the number of cakes 
produced, but the unfamiliar weights and numbers 
make it appear on the surface as if each variety had 
an entirely different composition. 



The work that the head of either culinary depart- 
ment of a hotel can actually do with his own hands 
must be but a small portion of the whole, and how- 
ever skillful he may be he must be largely dependent 
upon his assistants for the general excellence of his 
department. But these assistants cannot know and 
are not expected to leirn a different formula for 
every different thing they are required to make. Th'^ 
head mnn will get the more help from those working 
under him the more he can simplify the processes 
he gives them to carry out. 

The receipt already given under the head of Naples 
biscuits is a good one, but it is only spo ge cake 
mixture at last, and there is a simpler way that may 
be intrusted to the boys with perfect safety to make 
all the varieties of Italian cakes that are at all neces 
sary or desirable, and that is only to make common 
sponge cake batter in a plain and common way. 



15Y. 



Spon&re Cake. 



14 ounces of sugar. 

12 eggs. 

12 ounces of flour. 

Put the eggs and sugar together in a kettle, tin 
pail, or deep pan, set in a vessel of ice water and 
beat the mixture rapidly f r half an hour by the 
clock Then lightly s*ir in the flour. If the beat- 
ing be fiithful y perform-^d this sponge cike batter 
can be used to make lady-fingers, savoy cike3, plain 
ung'azed e po-^ge cakes, jelly rolls and the ha-f dozen 
varieties of Italian small ekes alre-.dy described. 



One day one of my boys showed me such an as!»ort- 
ment as the above all made out of a kettle of sponge 
cake batter 4 times the quan ity of the receipt, and 
when (hey hive been approved, with a sly look he 
said: " But I was late and only beat the eggs and 
sugar 20 minutes." 

«' Your ingredients were in good condition and the 
atmosphere is dry and cold. There are exceptions 
to every rule, but yoi*. must work by the rule and not 
the excepti>n. Besides there ia a good deal in 
knowing how to beat effectively." 



168. 



Butter Spongfe Oake. 



1 pound cf granulated sugar. 

10 eggs. 

8 Of 10 ounces of butter. 

1 cupful of milk — J pint. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
1^ pounds of flour. 

Beat the sugir and eggs together a few minutes 
as if for sponge cake, melt the butter and beat it in, 
add the milk, then the powder and then the flour 
and stir up well. Flavor if desired. 

If I had to lose the knowledge of all kinds of cakes 
but one I should choose the above. It is compara- 
tive'y cheap; when fresh it is as good as any, and 
answers more purposes than any other mixture 
made. In the exigencies that often overtake us when 
the hctel business is good, I have frequently begun 
when the doors were just opened for dinner, and 
had large sheets of this light cake 1 or 2 inches 
thick and nicely glazed with sugar baked on top 
ready to send in when the plates were changed 
either as pudding or cake — about 25 minutes from 
the time of beginning— which could not be done 
with any richer mixture. 



150. White Butter Sponge Oake. 



The same as the preceding made with the surplus 
white of eggs often lefc over from salad making, etc. 
Use 1 pound of whiles instead of the 10 eggs and 
add an ounce more butter. . 

It makes jelly cakes; may have raisins or currants 
mixed in, and if made cold enough to keep shape 
makes very fair sponge drops or other small cakes. 
It is the best also for the f-llowing. 

160. 

Oream Oake or "Washington Pie *' 

Bake (he butter sponge cake on jelly cake pans, 
quite thin, and place two sheets together with pastry 
cream thickly spread between. The pastry cream is 
the same that is used to fill cream pufts, which see 
or index. 



161. Oorn Starch Blanc Mange. 

2 quarts of milk and a cupful mere. 
12 ounces of sugar. 



42 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



-^ 



6 ounces of corn starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

A pinch of salt. Flavoring. 

Boll the milk with the eugnr in it. Mix the starch 
with the extra cup cf milk, stir it in and let cook 
a few minutes. Take from the fire, be t in the but 
ter to whi'en it, flavor, and put the blai c mange 
immediately into custord cups previous'y wet with 
water. When cold take it "but of the cups and serve 
cither wi*h a little tiweeteced cream, or iruii, or fruit 
jelly. Infetead of cups it may be spread in bright 
pans, cut ia square blocks and served with the 
smooth bjttom side up. 



io;3. 



Corn Starch Jelly. 



This can be very nice when ricely made ; if not 
made sour and harsh wi<h too much lemon nor hard 
and opaque with too much etarch. 

1 quart of water and a half pint over. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

1 small lemon, 

3 ouncs of corn starch — 3 heaping tablespoonfuls. 

Boil the water with the sugar in it aod add to it 
the juice of the lemon and about half the rind 
shaved off thin and cut in small pieces. Mix the 
starch with the extra cup of witer, stir it into the 
boiling syrup and let boil slowly for about 10 min- 
utes to lose its milky appearance and become almost 
clear. Pour it into custard cups or any kind of 
molds. Serve in saucers with a sf oonful oi sweet- 
ened cream whipped to froth. This jelly looks bet, 
ter if colored either with burnt sugar or like the 
following kind. 



1G3. 



Tapioca Jelly. 



1 quart of raspberry or other fruit juice strained. 

1 cupful of water. 
12 ounces of sugar, 
4 ounces of tapioca. 

Crush the tapioca, if the large kind, by rolliog it, 
and steep it 2 hours in the water and some cf the 
fruit juic?. Boil the rest of the raspberry juice 
wih the sugar in i% adl the steepecj tapioc* and let 
simmer 15 minutes or more. Put it in cups or other 
molds ard serve it cold with a spoonful of 'roYk. cf- 
egg custard i.\ the saucer, or with whipped cream. 
This can a'so be m^de with water and flavorings, as 
directed for corn starch jelly, 

164. Gelatine Blanc Mange. 

2 quarts of rich milk, 
12 ounces of sugtr. 

2 ounces ot gelatine. 

Flavorings. 

1 small cupful of cream to whiten it. 

Set the milk over the fire in a bright kettle with 
the sugar and gelatine in it, and stir them occasion* 
ally with a wire egg beater till the gelatine is all 



dissolved, but do not let it boil lest the milk curdle. 
Strain it into a pan and set away to cool. After it 
hascool.d tt r ia the flavoring- -lemon, vanilla, al. 
mond, cinnamon or any other — and the cup of cream. 
Pour it into molds or custard cups, cr an inch deep 
in milk pans, to be cut when set, in squares or dia- 
monds and served with cream cr diluted fruit jelly. 

The foregoing is the basis of several kinds of 
creams to ba described further on, and will be re- 
ferred to and not repeattd. 

A useful rule to keep in mind is — IJ ounces of 
gelatine to a quart of water for jeliy, etc., but 1 
ounce only to a quart of milk. 

Cooper's sheet gelatine sells at about half the price 
of the imported kinds; it is tasteless and as good as 
any except that is liable to curdle the milk on actual 
boiling. The transparent ge amines or isinglass, on 
the other hand, are as liable to burn on the bottom 
and are troublesome to dissolve. 

105. 

Condensing Milk for Blanc-Mangers and 
Creams. 



Skimmed milk which is superabundant in many 
hotels cr\n be immensely improved for the pastry 
cook's purposes by condensation. No process is re- 
quired but to set 4 quarts cf milk on the range in a 
shallow pan with the sugar in it that is required f .r 
2 quarts — probably 12 ounces — and let the milk sim. 
mer till reduced to 2 quirts. The cheesy coating 
that forms on boiling milk will not appear on that 
which has sugar in it. 



160. 



Jaune Mange. 



The blanc mange of the preceding receipt with 6 
yolks of eggs b aten in after the gelatine is dissolved 
and jufet before taking from the fire. 

Divide the bltnc mange and color only half of if 
ye-low with 3 or 4 yolks, and thus have two colort 
cut in Hmall blocks to serve in the same saucers. 
Jaune is yellow, as blanc is white. 



lOT. Almond Cream Blanc Mange. 

1 pouud of sweet almonds. 

2 ounces of bitter almonds or peach kernels, 
1 pouud of sug^r, 

1 quart of cold water. 

2 ( unces of gefatine. 

1 small cupful of cream. 

Boil the almonds 2 minutes, then take off the skins 
and pound them a few at a time in a mortar, adding 
a little Eugar and a spoonful of water occasionally. 
Put the a'mond paste in a bowl with the rest of the 
sugar and water and let steep a while. Dissolve 
the gelatine in a little warm water, add it to the 
milk-of-almonds, the cup of cream likewise and 
strain through a napkin with pressurr-. Set the 
blanc mange in molds on ice. 



THE AMEBICAN PASTRY OOOK.

168. Floatingr Islands. 

ijL good general bill of fare name for a number of 
useful trifles cold for dessert that are alike only in 
being something afloat in a sauce. 

1. "Whipped Syllabub" or "Trifle:" An orna- 
mental bowl of whipped cream flavored with wine, 
with a cake in it. 

3 pints of sweet cream. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

1 cupful of madeira or raisin wine 

2 thin jelly cakes size of saucers. 

Put the jelly cakes in 2 glass bowls. Whip the 
sweetened and flavored cream with a whip — churn 
till half of it is froth. Pour the fluid portion into 
the bowls, pile the froth on top, and drop spots of 
red jeliy or of cream, colored before churning, all 
over the surface — "Missis Jane" will dip it out with 
a silver ladle, at the head of the table. 

2. Italian cakes spread with jelly floating in 
wine custard, with whipped cream on top. 

2 quarts of boiled custard flavored with a cupful 
of maraschino. 

40 or 50 sponge drops spread with jelly. 

1 cupful of thick cream. 

Make the sponge drops as directed for lady-fingers, 
with a crisp stgar coating on top. Spread jelly on 
the bottoms and drop them, with the jelly side 
uppermost^ in saucers nearly filled with' the maras- 
chino custard. Whip the cream a little at a time as 
wanted fur filling the orders and place a spoonful on 
each float as they are sent in. 

3. The preceding kind can be made cheaper with 
plain boiled custard and thin sheets of cake cut in 
small squares. All the varieties must be very cold 
to be good. 

4. Place 4 or more lady-fingers, made small for 
the purpose and not doubled two together, ends 
downwards in jel'y glasses, and pile upon them some 
wine flavored whipped cream. 

6. Snow Eggs. Eggs a la Neige. Snow Balls: 

12 whites of eggs. 

1 or 2 ounces of granulated sugar. 

Flavoring. 

1 quart of rich yolk-of-egg custard cold. Have a 
pan of boiling milk and water ready in the oven. 
Let the whites of eggs be cold to begin with. Whip 
them firm, add the sugar, then drop egg shaped por- 
tions with a wet spoon into the boiling milk and 
water, and let them cook a few minutes with the 
oven door open. They may either be turned over 
■with a skimmer when half done or allowed to acquire 
some color on top like other meringues. If cooked 
too long these will shrink to almost nothing. Too 
much sugar likewise will spoil them. Srrve them 
cold in a saucer of custird. These egg floats are 
very old favorites. They may be variously flavored, 
and may have an ounce of melted common chocolate 



mixed with the whites while beating to make choco- 
late float. 

6. Make 2 quarts of boiled custard, set in the 
oven, after letting it cool a little, and drop meringue, 
the same that is spread over lemon piep, by spoonfuls 
all over the top. Let the meriigue dy bake with 
the oven door open 6 or 8 minutts, then set the pan 
away to get cold before serving. Dish up custard 
and a spoonful of the meringue in saucers. Care is 
required not to let the custard cook too much while 
the meringue is baking. The pan maybe set in 
another pan of water not boiling. 

169, Snow Float. 



Snow Pudding. Lemon Snow. Lemon Sponge. 
Mont Blanc, etc , etc , or Russian Jelly. 

2 quarts of water. 

4 ounces scant of gelatine. 

2 pounds of sugar. 

6 lemons— juice of all, rinds of 2 or 3. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Grate the lemon rinds and squeeze the juice into 
the sugar in a kettle, add the water and gelatine, set 
the kettle over the fire and beat the C3ntent8 fre- 
quently till the gelatine is all dissolved, which will 
be at about the boiling point. Strain it into an ice 
cream freezer or other vessel set in ice water, and 
when the jelly has become nearly cold beat it with 
a wire egg whisk till frothy a d almost whi e. Then 
whip the whites of eggs firm, stir them in and beat 
the whole again till it is set, when it will be like 
snow. 

Make a yellow custard with a quart of milk, 8 
yolks and 4 ounces of sugar, and flavor, and serve 
i£ in the sancers with a spoonful of the float, ice 
cold. 



Articles like the foregoing come in serviceably 
when, as so often happens there is no milk to be had, 
for even the custards to go with them can be made 
with water. 

For a yellow variety of the Russian jelly or gela- 
tine float, when it is just at the boiling point stir in 
the yolks of 8 or 10 eggs quickly and take the jelly 
from the fire immediately before ihey become cooked. 
Flavor with lemon extract if necessary and beat it 
up without the addition of white of eggf. 

Race ginger boiled in the jelly makes another 
kind. It should be colored with burnt sugar and 
beaten up like the snow float. 

Lemon juice more or less is essential in them all 
to correct the taste of gelatine. 

A spoonful of whipped cream can be served with 
the floats instead of custard. 

Snow float that is left over is all ready to be boiled 
and run through the jelly bag to make wine jelly of 
the clearest for the next day The white of egg in 
it clarifies it and then its strained out.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



Why do fifteen families, numbering seventy-five 
souls, have fifteen very poor cooks preparing fifteen 
very poor dinners over fifteen different fires vfhen, 
if they were all together, two skillful cooks with a 
helpei and a man in the yard and two fires ould 
prepare a most excellent dinner at less cost for them 
all? 



170. Fruit Jelly Floats. 

Good firm jellies of fruits can be beaten partially 
light after the manner of the gelatine kinds pre- 
ceding, and whipped whites of eggs can be beaten in 
as a finish. Take quince, peich, currant, or other 
jelly that is hard enough to cut with a knife and 
warm it sufficiently to beit. Set the bowl contain- 
ing it in a pan of ice water to cool it while beating, 
and to ^ pint of jelly allow J pound of powdered 
sugar. When light add the whipped whites of 6 
eggs. Beat 5 minutes more. Keep cold. Serve in 
saucers of cream. 



Why do fifteen families require as many persons 
to do the marketing for them, trusting to the 
butchers and bakers and others for the weights 
and measures, and trusting to luck for the quality 
of things bought because the qualities are too small 
to be worth a person's attention, when, if all were 
together, one buyer could buy better for them all at 
once, aided by acquired judgment and knowledge of 
goods and prices, and scales, weights, measures and 
books? 

171. Apple Float. 



1 pound of fine, mealy cooking apples pared and 
quartered. 
Half cup of water. 
1 lemon. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

1 ounce of butter. 

2 whole eggs and 6 whites. 
Clove or cinnamon extract. 

Stew the apples with the water^ sugar, lemon juice 
and shaved or grated rind and the butter, in a 
saucepan with a lid, till they are tender. Rub the 
pulp through a seive. Add the 2 eggs and cook the 
mixture 5 or 10 minutes till thick. Then cool, 
flavor, beat light and add the 6 whites of eggs whip, 
ped firm and beat 5 minutes more. Keep cold. 
Serve ia saucers of custard. 



And why do fifteen families living separately have 
fifteen small portions going to waste when, if all 
Were together, the small portions in the hands of a 
skillful cook would make a dish of which nearly all 
would partake and save a large item in the marke'- 



172. Baked Ooooanut Oustard* 



2 quarts of milk. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

6 ounces of corn starch. 

Butter size of a guinea egg—l oz. 

8 eggs. 

8 ounces of desiccated oocoanut. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it. Mix the 
starch in a bowl with a liitle cold milk, add it to the 
milk on the fire and take off" immediately with<"ut 
waiting for it to boil again. Beat in the butter, 
then the eggs, about half the cocoanut, and pour the 
custard into two buttered pans where it will be only 
an inch de?p. Sprinkle the rest of the cocoanut 
over the tops, and a little sugar over that and bake 
10 or 15 minutes till set and of a yellow color on 
top. Must be cold to serve. May have a spoonful 
of sweetened cream in the saucers. 



And when the ice supply is exhausted and the 
delicious ice creams a^.d water ices which the fifteen 
families have learned to prize above all the other 
contrivances for dessert suddenly fail to appear, 
why must fifteen persons at least worry over the 
situation and spend the days in unquietness conjur- 
ing up cold dishes that shall almost fill the ices' 
place, when one person making a trade of such 
knowledge could satisfy them all without eflfort? 



173. Peaches and Cream. 

The harder kinds of peaches should be chopped 
to the size of strawberries and mixed with sugar 2 
or 3 hours before the meal. Allow about 4 ounces 
of sugar to a quart. Soft peaches, after peeling, 
are best only quartered or E>liced. If admissible 
serve them ia large glass bowls ornamented with 
quarters of red or yellow peaches placed in order 
and a pitcher of cream with each bowl separately. 
If served individually in saucers pour the cream 
over only as they are dished up. 



Once we read in the Atlantic Monthli/ a series of ar- 
ticles in which all such questions as the preceding were 
asked with the intent of advising a system of co- 
operative housekeeping under which the fifteen 
household martyrs, one for each of the said fifleen 
families, instead of all suffering at once sh uld take 
turn and turn about doing the work of each depart- 
ment far the entire co-operating community, It is 
a good many years ago, but we remember thinking 
then that the only practicable form of co-operative 
housekeeping is the American hotel system, modi- 
fied perhaps in the matters of ^ider separation of 
rooms and of individual freedom. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



174. Strawberries and Cream. 

It generally mellows and improves the fruit to let 
it remain covered with sugar in a old place a short 
time before serving. Serve same as peaches and 
cream. 

Strawberries, raspberries and peaches in sugar 
served in saucers of ice cream must be mentioned 
also as the great public festival delicacies of the 
season of fruits. For ice creams, either pure cream, 
ordinary, or corn starch creams see index. 

For the co-operative housekeeping idea has the 
defect of leaving out the power of discharging in- 
competents. Under the hotel system when dfflculties 
arise the heads of departments will make almost 
superhuman efforts and accomplish almost impossi 
bilities, partly because of the pecuniary value of 
their positions but more on account cf the reputation 
for eflSciency to be m ide or maired. But no c )• 
operative could be a good cook, for example, who 
should be in office only one week and out four, and 
did not care much for the office anyway There are 
a thousand rocks on which such a community would 
split up, like the following. 

176. Strawberry Shortcake. 



Scarcely two families or two persons make this 
alike or believe any other person's way ij the best. 

We are not going to lay down any rule, but as 
long as people are asked which part of a turkey they 
they prefer, or how they will have their beefsteak 
cooked we expect to ask them how they have their 
strawberry shortcake made. 

The bakers and confectioners, who often sell large 
quantities generally mike laycs of sweet cake such 
as the butter sponge cake, and place 3 of the sheets 
with sweetened strawberries between. 

But plenty of people say that is not right, but 
what can you expect the bakers lo know about home 
doings, and they make a rich flaky sort of biscuit 
dough with a good deal of shortening in and bake a 
large round cake big as a dinner plate, split it open 
and place a plenty of strawberries between the two 
halves. 

And there are others, whose tastes have become 
Titiated through the enjoyment of the best hotel 
pies, who say the foregoing kind of short ca'<e is 
too poor and they want their short cake to be short, 
so they have the best light and dry puff pastp, or 
the trimmings of it wh ch have been rolled more, 
rolled out thin on jelly cake pans, nicely baked, 
rather dry and crispy, and strawberries with their 
sugary syrup spread plentifully between two, and 
powdered sugar on lop. 

But even after these wnys have been tried there 
remain the weighty que tions of whether after straw- 
berries have been spread between there shou'd also 
be more strawberries on the top, and whether the 



short cake of biscuit dough should be buttered before 
being berried, ar d whether the berries may have 
cr am mixed with tliem or whether c eam is to be 
served with the 6hortc«ke. In short, to quote the 
words of the song, 'How do you like your shortcake 
done?" 

The best kind of flaky light dough will be found 
in the receipt for roly-poly puddings. It. is made 
with half the pie-pa-te quantity of butter and half 
baking powder, rolled in. 

177. Bavarian Oream. 



1 J pints of milk. 

1^ pints of thict cream, 

12 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of gelatine — full weight. 

1 cupful or leas of maraschino. 

Set the milk ovor the fire with the sug4r nnd gel- 
atine in it a' d s'ir till the gt^lstine i^ all dissolved — 
nearly at the boili'^g point. Then strain it into an 
ice c"eim freezer se*^^ in ice water and let it get 
nearly cold. Whip the cream to froth. Beat the 
milk in the frrezT likewise and then mix the two 
and continue be -ting till the Bivarian is a delicate 
while sponge, and mix ia the maraschino while 
beating. 

178. Thfse creams are the most acceptable of all 
the substitutes for ice ere m, and have the advantage 
tfeat they can be s t in molds, and different sorts 
placed on a set table at the same time, or a mold 
entire serv.d at a family tab'e For hotel tervice it 
is generally brst to serve them out of ihe ffcezer ia 
saucers with whipped cream or fruit. They then 
appear on the bill of fare as : 

Mara chino Bavarian Cream. 

B-ivari<in C^eam wi h Corapole of Pears,— or with 
grapes, white cherries, or with strawberri'-s not 
cooked; the comnotes of course to be ice cold, a 
spoonful served like a sauce with the white cream. 

179, Bavarian Oream Oheap<^'' 



3 pints of rich milk. 

1 cupful of cream. 
12 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of gelatine. 
6 whites of eggs. 
Flavoring. 

Set the milk over the fi'-e with the sugar and gel- 
atine in it and stir tiil the gelatine is all dissolved. 
Do not let it boil Strain into a freezer placed in 
ice water and when nearly cold enough to set add 
the cup of creana, beat 10 minutes, whip the 6 
whites firm, stir that in and beat the cream 5 min- 
utes more. Flavor while beating with lemon, vanilla, 
almond, or other extract, instead of miraschino. 



46 



THE AMEKICAN PASTKY COOK. 



King Louis did not keep hia huge establishments 
for profit and made hia Bavarian bbout like this — 
quite costly : 1 quart of double cream, 2\ ounces of 
gelatine, 6 ounces of powdered sugar, 1 cup of milk, 
J cup of noyan or other liqueur. Dissolve the gela- 
tine in the milk in a varm place. Put the sugir in 
the cream, "whip it to froth, drain the froth and whip 
again what drip"? through. Put back in the pan 
pour the dissolved gelatine to the whipped crjfra a 
little at a time, add fhe flavor and put the cream in 
molds slightly oiled with sweet oil and set ot ice. 
This, it may be observed, is barely one r3move from 
the iced froths notised nmong th ? ice«". The froth is 
congealed by means of geUtine very cjld instead cf 
frost, and might be in glasses as well. 



180. Strawberry Bavarian Oream 



BAVAaVOISE AUX FOAISES. 



1 quart of double cream. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

1 quart of strawberries. 

2^ ounces cf gelatine. 

Dissolve the gelatine in a little of the cream 
with as much milk added to thin it. Rub the straw- 
berriea through a sdve, and add half the sugir to 
them. Whip the cream with the rest of the sugir 
in it to froth, mix in the dissolved gelatine, then the 
strawberry syrup and set ia molds. 



181 Another Way. 

Line j'-lly molds with strawberries dipped in 
melted jel'y to make them stick, and the molds eet 
in ice water. When set firm fill the lined molds 
with either of the foregoing Bavarian creams. 

182 Komau Oream. 



I quart of milk, 

10 ounces cf suga*. 

1| ounces of gelatine — good weight. 

Piece of st'ck cinnamon. 

1 cupful of thick cream. 

12 yolks of eggs. 

1 cupful of curacao, or Madeira wine. 

Set the milk over the fire and put in a piece of 
thick cinnamon, the sugar and gelatine and stir till 
the gelatine ia all dissolved Be;it the yolks light 
and pour the milk just about at the boiling point to 
them. Set on the fire Rgain for a minute but do not 
let it boil. Strain into a freezer set in ice water. 
When nearly cold enonjrh to pet whip the cupful of 
oream and beat it in and fdd the caracao. T&is is a 
fine dusky yellow cre.im light and spongy, that falls 
apart in the saucers of its own weiglit. 

183. The particular touch about all of these 
creams is the gettiug along with the smallest possi- 
ble quantity of gelatine. They are quite another 



thing and are not really good when made firm and 
tough with it. The object of the gelatine is to give 
consistency enough to the milk to allow it to become 
spongy when b aten like whippe I cre^m. This also 
necessitates the creams b ing served very cold, a 
point on which their excellence a'so greatly depends 



184. Italian Cream. 

Only another name for R man cream. The fol 
lowing U the form with pure cream which, if it 
were the only way would genera- 'y prec'ude its 
appearance at hote^ tables The Italians themselves 
line to flavor it strongly with rum and add ground 
cinnamon till it look*? brown, 

1 quart of cream to boil, 

1 pint of d uble c earn to whip cold, 

1 pound of sugr. 
16 yolks of eggs. 

2 ounces of gelatine. 

Stick of cinnamon and piece of orange peel. 

Curacai or sherry or Madeira to flnvor. 

Put the gelitiue in a cup cf milk in a warm place 
to dissolve sora^ time bef <re wanted. Boil the quart 
uf creim with the sugar, cinr^amon and orange peel 
ia it. Beat. iLc yolks and pour them to the boiling 
cream and immediately take off and etraia into a 
freezer surrounded with ice water. When nearly 
cold pour in the dissolved gelatine and beat up 
light, then whip the pint of double cream to froth 
and stir it in and lastly the liqueur. 

We will point out here that all of our own ways, 
which we call hotel ways, being sh »rt and direct, 
dispense wi h the separate dissolving of the gelatine, 
which is really a troublesome and time consuming 
little matter. ^^ e dissolve it ia the milk or cream 
on the fire, without evei a previous steeping. Still 
if we hsppen to drop into the work-rcon;s of some 
restaurant Francaise we shall find them proceeding 
in a difierent manner, and such reoeipts as the last 
serve to show what that manner is. 



185. Italian Cream with Compote of 
Figs 

Cut a pound of fig«i into small pieces and one or 
two lemons likewise and stew them ti gether with 
sugar and water. Make the compote ice cold and 
serve it a spoonful in each saucer with the Roman 
or Italian cr<»am. A compote of fruit is fruit stewec? 
in a thick rich syrup. 

186. Rocky Mountain Oream. 



Make Bavarian cream, about half the quantity of 
the first Bavarian receipt, alvo prepare ab ut a pint 
of sweet green muscatel grapes, and enough of 
bright cleir jellies cut in dice to make another pint. 
When the cream is finished beating and about to set 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



47 



firm mix in the grapes and jellies lightly without 
breaking them, and pour into a bright milk pan 
where it will be about 1 J inches deep. Shal e and 
smooth it down and set on ice Wh?,a to bo served 
cut acr' S8 in strips 2 inches wide. Cut these again 
in triangle shapes. Place the piece in the paucer 
with the point upwards, pyramid form, and a spoon- 
ful of whipped cream around. 

There should be 3 colors of jelly, clear lemon, 
amber and red wine. 



187. Ohocolate Cream. 

1 quart of milk. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

1 ounce of gelatine 

2 ounces of grated common chocolate. 
8 yolks of eggs and ?. whites. 

1 cup of cream. 

Vanilla extract. 

Set the milk over the fire with the sugar chocolate 
and gelatine in it. Beat as it heats with the wire 
whisk till all is dissolved. Beat the yolks in a bowl 
and at the first sign of boiling add them to the miik 
on the fire, let remain about a minute then strain 
into a freezer set in ice water. 

Rinse out the thick chocolate custard that adheres 
to the kettle with the cup of cre^m and add that to the 
other in the freezer. Flavor with vanilla, beat up 
as it cools and at lait add the 3 whites whipped firm 
and beat up 5 minutes more. Put tho cre^m in oiled 
molds or serve it by epoonfuls out of the freezer with 
a spoonful of sweetened cream whipped to frcth as 
a sauce 



188. Pistachio Cream. 



Make Bavarian cream half the quanity of the 
first Bavarian receipt. Throw a pound of pistachio 
kernels in a vessel of boiling water and in two min- 
utes take them out, peel, and pound them a few at 
a time in a mortar with a spoonful of witer. Rub 
the pas'e through a seive, mix it with the Bavarian 
while beating and color with spinach green — the 
pressed out juice of spinach leaves mixed with 
sugir. 

Where this cream is desired only for its green 
color as when it is to fill a mold in imitation of a 
bunch of asparagus with green tops, almonds can be 
used inste id of pistachios ; they are very much 
cheaper; and spinach juice coloring used the same. 

189 Rose Cream. 

Make Bavarian, flavor elightly with rose extract 
ani color it light piuk. 



190 Charlotte Russe. 

Line a plain rak^ mold, or a small round tin pan, 
or a long and parrow mold made for the purpose 
with either lady fingers or large pponge d'ops. This is 



done by dipping the edges of the cakes in white of 
eggs and p'acing them ude by side overlapping each 
o:her. Then msike Bavarian cream sufficient, and 
when fi lishel beating, just as it begins to set, fill up 
the molds wiih it. 

If poured in too thin the cream runs and covers 
up the cakes, yet it should be fluid enough to settle 
to the shape and bind them all together. 

Set the charlotte in the refrigerator to become firm 
and cold. 



191. Bavarian cream is designated as being the 
filling oftenest empl >jed, but there is no rule in the 
matter and any other of the creams can be used as 
well. Charlotte a la Chantilly is charlotte-rus''e 
filled with the thickest of thick cream sweetened and 
flavored and whipped to froth and made firm enough 
to turn out simply by being mide very cold. Char- 
lotte russe au marasquin is the charlotte filled with 
marach"no B .varian cream very highly flavored 
with the liqueur and with corrrspondirgly less 
sugar. Charlotte russe auz /raises U the charlotte 
filled wiih strawberry Bavarian cream, or with whcle 
strawberries iu whipped cream like the mode chan- 
tilly. 

192 Individual Charlottes 



It is easily prac icable to make them in custard 
cups with 3 thin lady fingers trimmed a little to 
shape and tot overlapped. Fill with any of the 
creims and place thf m in the refrigera or to se' solid. 
When served have ready some thick whipped cream, 
turn out the charlottes on ice cream plates and top 
them with a spoonful of the froth. 

193. Serving Large Charlottes 

Says an old author — Fielding: *• Many exquisite 
viands m'ght be rejected by the epicure if it was a 
sufiicient cauee for his contemning of them as com 
mon and vulgar, that something was to be found in 
the most paltry aUeys under the same name. * * 
Where then lies the differ<?nce be ween the food of 
the nobleman and the porter, if boh are at dinner 
on the same ox or calf, but in the seasoning, the dress 
ing, the garnishing, and the setting forthV 

Charlotte-ruise is one of the few royal dishes that 
have become universally known — by name. But aa 
common'y met with it is a fine thing * run to seed;'* 
one of the shabby genteel ; a very distant relation 
of the original. Ti e first departure uses a pponge 
cake with the inside all cut out and the omst filled 
up with a cream or blaac-mange not so bad ; but it 
falls from that to a lining of slices of any sort of 
stale cake, of burnt, scraped and trimmed cake, husks 
and scraps, filled with something sour and nas'y. 

The individual siyle of service makes the long and 
, • arrow shai.e of mold desirable for slices ?o be cut 



48 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



across, but the lining should always be of lady 
fingers, their thinness and glazed sugar surface ma- 
king them the most suitable. 

But a large round charlotte may be sliced as well 
like a cake or cheese and tlie good workman will 
like to show in such broad slices the sponge-like 
texture of the cream filling. A spoonful of thick 
sweetened cream ice cold should be placed in the 
plate or saucer first. 

104. A charlotte set on the tab!e whole should 
be ornamented with small piping patterns of cake 
icing on the sides and a coat of thin icing on top 
colored very light brown with a red hot salamander 
held over it. A chantilly charlotte should have no 
cake lining on the bottom of the mold^ and when 
turned out should have whipped cream pi'.ed high 
on top and spotted wi'h red or wi'h pieces of colored 
jelly. A strawberry ch^irloMe in like manner should 
have strawbetriea and whipped cream heaped upon 
it. A border of whipped cream placed around the 
base, or meringues inverted like cups filled with 
berries or grapes and set around are other suitable 
and proper ornaments, and so are the shapes of gel- 
atine paste colored green with spinach juice as rec- 
ommended for molds of ice cream. 



195. Parisian Charlotte. 



Receipts and directions f^r making difterent colors 
of g^aza or boiled icing were given in connection 
with white cakes near the beginning of this book. 
Cut some thin sponge drops or sheets of fipooge cake 
in squares and dip one side of them by means of a 
fork in the g^aze and let thtm dry and harden. Have 
several colors. Line plain drum shaped molds with 
these colored squares checker-board fashion, dip- 
ping the edges in melted g'aze or candy to make 
them stick. Then fill up the molds with any of the 
creams. When cold and set turn out and set on the 
table whole as directed for charlotte-russe. 



196 Wanted — A Name. Is everything and a^l 
this country really running to pie? A Chic go lady 
tourist kindly wishing to do the writer a service de. 
scribed for him her way of making a "Charlotte- 
russe" that is highly esteemed among her circle cf 
friends. It accordingly here appears in place. Bake 
2 thin shee's of spongecake on jelly cake pans and 
while they are ftill warm p'ace them on soup plates 
and press them lightly to the shape. Fill one with 
whipped cream with gelatine in it (Bavarian cream 
in effect) and place the other sheet of cake over it 
like a lid. This is convenient to cut. It can be 
covered with powdered sugar or with icing. It is 
good, excellent, but through some miserable preju- 
dice or other we don't like to call it charlotte-russe. 
It is too much like pie. 



197. Charlotte for a Small Party. 



And now for the convcn'enoe of those wishing 
just one charlotte rus-e and riot enough for a ho^el 
dinner we append a first-class working receipt that 
will suit. 

2^ pints of thin cream. 

1 teacupful of maraschino. 

7 ounces of sugar. 

1 package of Cox's gelatine — 1 J ounces. 

Put the extra half pint of cream in a small sauce- 
pan and the gelatine and sugar with it, set over the 
fire and beat with the wire egg whisk till the gela- 
tine is all dissolved — the quicker the better. Pour 
the maraschino into the cold cream, then strain in 
the contents of the saucepan, set the whole in a pan 
of ice water with salt in it and whip the cream mix- 
ture till it begics to set, when pour it into the pre- 
pared mold. 

The mold should be made ready beforehand. A 2 
quart jelly mold wi 1 d'^, or a cake mold. Line it 
with lady-fingers placed edge to edge, the edges 
wetted with white cf egg. Ornament the top on 
turning out with whipped cream or meringue. 



198 Table Jellies- 



There are jellies made with pure fruit juice fil- 
tered through paper and set with gelatine — French 
extras- -we may touch upon them further on. These 
first considered are the everyd>=y, off hand sort found 
on hotels tables and in the windows of the confec- 
tioners who sell them by the mold or glassful, or 
furnish paity suppers. 



199. Stock Jelly. 

Once making of stock jelly serves for 2 or 3 meals. 
For 6 quarts take; 

6^ quarts of water. 

3 pounds of sugar. 

8 ounces of gelatine. 

10 lemons — ^julce of all, thin shaved rinds of 5. 

1 or 2 ounces of whole spices — cloves, mace, 
cinnamon. 

10 whites of eggs. 

Put the water in a bright brass kettle, add all the 
other ingredients — the lemon juice squeezed in 
without the seeds, the yellow rind pared very thin, 
and the white of egga'bealen a little with some water 
mixed in first. The clean egg shells may be put 
in also to assist in the clarification. Use the sheet 
gelatine that floats, f )r preference. Then set the 
kettle on the side of the range and let it slowly come 
to a boil with occasional stirring. 

Let it boil about half an hour and above all, to 
avoid the trouble and waste of having to boil it 
again, be sure that the white foam of egg on top 
becomes thoroughly cooked so that it will go down 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



49 



and mix with the jelly again like so much meal. 
Sometimes to accomplish this it is necessary to set 
the kettle jin the oven a few minutes to get heat 
enough on the top. 

Then run it through the flannel jelly bag sus- 
pended from a hook. The boiling having been prop- 
erly attended to there should be not the slighest 
difficulty in getting it to run through not only clear 
but bright and transparent as glass. The first pour- 
ing coats the inside of the filtering bag with the 
congealed white of egg and every succeeding running 
through brightens the jelly. ^ 

The above makes jelly of good quality. It can be 
made cheaper with less sugar and lemons. It may 
be set down as a rule that jelly cannot be made this 
way without more or less lemon juiee or some acid 
equivalent — it will not run through a filtering bag 
without. 



200. Jellies in Variety. 

The stock having been made it can now be divi- 
ded into as many kinds as may be desired, thanks to 
the flavoring extract makers. 

But the stock jelly is already good and mildly 
flavored and care should be taken not to over season 
it, or injure its bright appearance. 

Jelly is quite as much for ornament as use. It 
can easily be made to attract notice at the finest table 
for its lustre and rich colors even if never tasted, 
therefore its appearance is the main consideration. 
Lemon extract cannot be put in jelly because it 
makes a milky appearance and dims its brilliancy. 
Orange extract the same Most of the other extracts 
can be used to flavor. Use wine in small proportion 
to mix with some of the stock and color deep red, 
but run through the jelly bag again while it is yet 
warm. Flavor some with vanilla and color it either 
amber or brown with burnt sugar, and run it 
through the jelly bag again. Flavor some with straw- 
berry and color it pink, and leave some plain, pale 
yellow. 



201. Soda Water Jellies. 



Having a number of difterent colors and flavors 
prepared as above, fill a sufficient number of tall 
thin stem glasses with them, but not quite to the 
top, and set them in a cold place to harden. Make 
the foam for the tops by beating a pint of jelly with 
a wire egg whisk in a pan set in ice water and when 
it is partly frothed whip up the whites of 3 eggs, 
add them to the jelly and continue beating them 
together a minute or two. Then pile the white froth 
thus made on top of the glasses. Keep them in a 
cold place to solidify, and serve them very cold. 
These make a fine appearance in pyramidal form on 
a set table. 



202. One Quart of Jelly. 

The rule is, for good quality : 

1 quart of water. 

1^ ounces of gelatine. 

8 ounces of sugar- 

1 or 2 lemons 

1 teaspoonful of whole mixed spices. 

2 whites of eggs and the clean shells. 

But a cupful of water more must be added to 
allow for evaporation and loss unless it is intended 
to add J pint of wine to the stock jelly produced. 



For jellies to serve ordinarily at dinner pour them 
in bright pans, an inch or more in depth and when 
set cut out little diamond shaped blocks and serve 
two such pieces of different color in the same saucer. 



203. Champagne Jelly. 

Dissolve one package of Cox's or other fine shred 
gelatine in ^ pint of hot water with 6 ounces of 
sugar in it. Beat about over the fire to dissolve it 
quickly. Then strain the dissolved gelatine into a 
quart of champagne in a large bowl. Set on ice and 
when it is about to set take out half a cupful and 
beat it with a wire egg whisk 1 minute. Return the 
frothed jelly to the bowl, stir round once and let it 
remain on ice to solidify, either in Hie bowl to be 
cut out in blocks, or in glasses. There will be bub. 
bles all through the jelly and a thin froth on top. 



204. Sparkling Wine Jelly. 

Take the brightest wine jelly, deep red, as made 
by the sfock jelly method, ana froth a little of 
it and manage as directed for champagne jelly, stir- 
ring the froth in with only one turn — not beating, 
which would destroy its clearness — whipped jelly 
can be congealed in the bottom of a mold first, nearly 
cold jelly poured in and the whole turned out at last 
with the froth on top. 



205. Punch Jelly. 

Make a quart of stock jelly by the 1 quart re- 
ceipt, and when finished add to it a small cup of 
strong tea and a small cup of mixed wine and 
brandy. Cut a lemon in small thin slices and let 
them float in it. Dish up with pieces of lemon in 
each portion. 



206. Pure Fruit Juioe Jellies. 

For orange jelly : Put the thin shaved rind of 2 
oranges in a bowl, squeeze in the juice of 4. Boil 
a quart of water with a pound of sugar and pour 
the hot syrup to the orange peel and juice. Dissolve 
2 ounces of gelatine in a cup of hot water separately. 
When the syrup has stood long enough to draw the

THE A.MERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



flavor of the orange peel filiter it— instead of using 
white of eggs to clarify — through a flannel bag lined 
with a sheet of blotting paper. Afterwards mix in 
the dissolved gelatine. 

All sorts of fresh fruit juices can be jellified in 
the above manner. For a guide to the proportions 
of fruit and sugar required in so much water see 
the receipts for fruit ices. The rule for gelatine is 
l^ ounces to a quart of water or juice. 

207. Calf's Foot Jelly. 

Calves' feet make good jelly as does gelatine, it 
is only more brittle and liable to fall apart of its 
own weight. 4 feet will produce about a gallon of 
jelly. Set them on to bcil in 3 gallons of water and 
keep them simmering at the back of the range till 
they are dissolved and the liquor is reduced to less 
than half, which may be in 8 or 10 hours. For 
further directions see the Book of Salads. When 
the calf's foot jelly has been divested of grease it is 
the same thing as gelatine and water and is ready to 
have sugar and other ingredients added to make 
stock jelly in the usual way. 



208^ Ornamental Jellies. 



1. Fruits in jelly: With the very clearest and bright- 
est jelly various pretty devices can be carried out. 
Place a fine bunch of grapes in a mold and fill up with 
jelly. Or partially line a mold with fruits dipped in 
jelly and let them get cold in place before filling up 
with jelly. Orange and lemon slices float, but they 
can be dipped in warm jelly and pushed down to 
line molds of jelly that is nearly set. Peach and 
apricot quarters may be done the same way. 

2. Fish and other illusions in jelly : Many jelly 
molds and articles of crockery ware have fishes and 
fruits stamped in for ornament. Pour a teaspoonful 
of blanc-mange or jaune mange into the pattern, set 
it in ice water, turning it about so as to thinly coat 
it, then fill up the hollow with jelly and let it all 
set firm. Line a large jelly mold with a coating of 
clear jelly turned about in it in a pan of ice water. 
Place your little white or yellow fishes on the lining 
and when they have become solidly set fill up the 
mold with clear jelly nearly cold. The fishes appear 
solid enough from the outside but when cut all that 
can be found of them is a small mark no thicker 
than a knife blade. 

3. Macedoine jelly : Cut different colored jellies 
in small dice and mix them together.. Moisten with 
a little clear jell" melted but nearly cold and fill 
molds with it. 

4. Fill molds wiih 3 colors by letting one larger 
set solid and then pouring another kind upon it. 



209. Geneva Lake Cakes. 

Device f )r showing fine icing work that is lost on 
large pieces Make 2 ielly cakes of 3 or 4 layers 
each and of diameter as broad as the largest cake 
stands will hold, and cut out the inside of all but the 
bottom layer of the cakes, making a basin sur. 
rounded by a wall Spread the inside wi'h some 
kind of jam to hide the cake and then fill them to 
the brim with the clearest jelly, amber color for one 
and light red for the other. Ice over the top sur- 
rounding rim of cake. 

The jelly when poured in must be just at the 
point of beginning to set. If too firm its transpar- 
ency will be destroyed, and if too thin it may soak 
into the cakes. 

On the glassy surface of these lakes may be placed 
white swans of the finest icing, water lilies, boats, 
gondolas, arbors set on islands, trees, temples, foun- 
tains, all of the smallest practicable size. Every 
thread of the finest icing shows plainly on the sur- 
face of these jelly charlottes, and besides they are 
very good to eat. 



210. White Mountain Gems. 

Make thin sponge drops about the size of the 
top of a teacup and place spots of meringue paste or 
icing all around their edge to form a rim or border. 
The spots should be the size of small cranberries and 
a high point should be drawn up as the tube leaves 
them. Bake a few minutes with the oven door 
open to dry the icing straw color. Fill the centers 
with a spoonful of wine or lemon jelly so nearly 
cold as not to run much. 



211. Spring Lake Gems. 



Make macaroon paste by the receipt for common 
macaroons, drop portions on baking pans and flat- 
ten them somewhat by means of two spoons. Bake 
the macaroons, and when slacked baked put (hem 
into patty pans or gem pans of corresponding size 
and press them into the shape to form a sort of little 
baskets when cold. Ornament the edges of these 
with small spots icing as in the preceding article, 
bake a minute or two, and when cold fill the gems 
with minced wine jelly of different colers mixed. 



212. Icing and Ornamenting Cakes. 

As these matters have been mentioned incidentally 
in other parts of the book we will recapitulate by 
observing that there are three well-known ways of 
ornamenting cakes; first, by patterns in piping of 
white icing on the cake itself not iced, as on the 
fine yellow, glazed surface of a savoy cake, or a 
dark chocolate cake, or a charlotte-russe ; second, 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



61 



by covering tbe cakes with different colored glaze or 
boiled icing as described in conneciioa with white 
cakes, and, third, by frosting with the raw icing as 
made for meringue puff? and "kisses," and orna- 
menting with the same. 



The first requisite is to make the cake itself sym 
metricil and level by trin;ming. The cakes of a 
skillful cake maker will rise in baking all round 
alike so that only a mere shaving will have to be 
taken off, but whether little or much must be cut it 
is obvi jusly useless to try to make an object that is 
not "square with the world" look well by merely 
covering its deformity with a coat of icing. 

Fruitcakes always require two coas of icing, and 
all cakes th'it are to be handsomely ornamented 
should have the same double covering. 

Make the icing as directed under the head of 
mencgue puffi and macaroons, with a pound of 
powdered sugar to 6 whites of eggs. Spread it all 
over the cakei with a palette knife, smooth over 
rough places, fill up hollows, cover the hole left by 
the cake mold in the center with a patch of writing 
paper aid ice over that, and leave the cakes an 
hour or two to dry. 

For the pecoud coat use powdered sugar sifted 
through a fine geive or Swiss muslin ; beat up a 
pound with 4 whites and then add 4 more whites one 
at a time, beating aft^ each addition till the icing 
is firm again, except the last white which makes the 
glossy surface on the cake and should only be beaten 
in a little. Drop in the few drops of acetic acid 
sometime near the end of the beating and carefully 
add a drop or two of liquid bluing or dissolved 
indigo, to whiten the icing, and some flavoring 
extract. 

213. To get a fine surface on the cakes as smooth 
and free from marks as fine card board the icing 
must b3 first as firm by beating as it can be m^de 
and thinned with the last \\hite of egg, and another 
if necessity till it will settle slowly to smo ^thness 
on tlie cikes, but will not actually drip off. Be- 
sides that the cakes must be made smoother by dex- 
terously drawing over them the edge of a band of 
paper. 

Cut a sheet of foolscap into ribbons 2 inches wide. 
Spread the prepared icing thickly on the the top of 
the cake, take the paper strip by the two ends and 
scrape (ff the surplus icing with the paper edge at 
one even stroke, drawing towards you. Persons in 
practice can so well manage a ribbon of paper held 
stretched between the fingers and thumbs of both 
hands that way that they can smooth over a cushion 
or any concave or convex shape covered with icing 
without leaving the mark of either beginning or 
ending. 

When the sides of the cakes have likewise been 
OBvered and smoothed set the cakes in a drying 
place. 



214. The ornamental piping on cakes is done 
by pressing stiff icing or meringue paste out of the 
cut point of a paper cornet. Roll up half a sheet of 
note paper into funnel shape and pin it, nearly fill 
with the icing, and double over the paper so as to 
shut it in. If you cut off the point of the cornet 
straight the piping pressed out will be a plain round 
cord. If a slanting side snip is taking off the icing 
comes out like narrow tape. Cut the poiit of the 
paper like saw teeth and a three or four sided cord 
is formed, and there are many variations. We name 
the paper cornet for example,but for constant use there 
are made tubes or points of the thinnest brass plate 
filed into the required shapes at the points, and 
these are draped into paper cornets made large 
enough to receive them. 

The brass point that is filed into three saw teeth 
will form a border of leaves around a cake. The 
tooth that is uppermost is caused by a motion of the 
hand to make the indentation marks as the icing 
passes under and out, and a sudden breaking off 
draws out the leaf to a point, Tliis will probably 
sufficiently explain the matter of cake ornamenta- 
tion for those who have never seen it done, the rest 
must come through actual practice and example. 



215. To Make Flowers for Oake Orna- 
ments. 



Flower making of icing and gum paste is a trade 
of itself and it is generally cheaper to buy than to 
make them. But it often happens that the ready 
made article is not obtainable and we must do the 
best we can. 

Dip three or four sheets of writing paper in some 
wax melted on a plate and form the flowers with the 
cornets or brass tubes on the waxed paper. The 
cornet that has the point cut off slantwise when 
pressed will discharge the icing in a narrow ribbon 
form and it is not difficult with that to form five 
rounded leaves, the points all meeting in the center 
and making a pansy, or a number of narrower petals 
around a centre like a dahlia. To make the con- 
ventional red and white roses a core, or little 
pyramid an inch high has first to be made and 
let dry to form them on. These coves are of 
stiff icing forced out of a cornet and drawn up 
high. They should stand on small pieces of waxed 
paper. V\ hen dry and hard wrap a morsel of 
the ribbon icing pressed out of the cornet over 
the point of the core, like the inside leaf of a rose- 
bud. After suddenly breaking off the ribbon com- 
mence again at the back of the first leaf and form 
another, covering the point of the core on the other 
side. Let the next leaf lean outwards a little and 
the next still more, making them all adhere to the 
core by one edge of the ribbon and making the rose 
leaves larger and larger till the core is covered and 
there is room for no more. The flat four and five 



6ft 



THE AMERICAN PASTBY COOK. 



leaved flowers, such as resemble apple blossoms and 
pansies, s'lould be painted with a few fine lines of 
color. The roses are made red by coloring the icing 
they are m de of. 

After learning to use the cornets in making 
borders on cakes and making flowers, to mane 
raised ornamental work, such as lattice work, 
fences, sides of temples, etc , to be raised up and 
joined together on the cakes, or baskets and other 
objects it is only necessary to know that all such 
may be made on paper coated with white w ix, and 
when the object is dry and hard the paper can be 
warmed and it will slip off. 

Most of the white plaster-like ornaments for cakes 
in the confectioners' windows, such as birds, baskets, 
lace leaves, vases and twelfth-cake figures are made 
of gum paste, a compound that could be eaten but 
probably never is, although it is one-half sugar. 



216. Gum Paste. 

1 ounce, or a little more of gum tragacanih (gum 
dragon). 

8 ounces of finest powdered sugar. 

8 ounces of corn starch. 

The gum must be soaked 12 hours or more before 
it is used. Put it in a cup with half a cup cf water, 
cover to keep out dust and set it on a warm shelf 
When dissolved squeeze it through a clean towel by 
twisting with considerable force. Scrape up the 
gum, place it on a dish, add the sugar a little at a 
time and work them together with a paddle or 
wooden spoon. Add a drop of liquid blue to whiten 
it. When the sugar is all in begin adding the starch 
the same way. Pull out the paste as it becomes stiff, 
and double and pall again, and when all the starch 
has been worked in the paste is ready for use. It 
may be pressed into shallow molds of fancy figure:} 
made in plaster of paris, or in carved boards and 
left in them till dry and hard. 

217- Almond Gum Paste. 



An eatable sort, and semi- transparent: 

1 ounce of gum tragacanth — allow more for waste. 

1 pound of fine powdered sugar. 

4 ounces of the paste of pounded almonds. 

8 ounces of corn starch. 

Blanch the almonds, pound them to a fine paste 
and pass it through a stive. Make the gum paste 
as direcied in the preceding article and add the 
almond paste to it after the sugar and before the 
starch. This is suitable to make small cornucopia 
or horns of plenty, and other objects to be orna- 
mented with fine icing for a finish. 



218. Candy Ornaments. 
A marble slab or marble top table is needed to 



form panels, windows, and the like, of clear candy, 
on. S ightly oil the slab. Take a cornet filed with 
icing and form the outline frame of a church window, 
for example, and into the rim so made pour clear 
colored candy. S^x or eight keystone shaped panels 
made the same way may be set up and joined together 
by the edges to form a basket, which in turn may 
be fil'ed with macaroons. 

The rim to held the candy in shape on the slab 
may be made of dough oiled over, or of putty when 
large sheets of candy are needed to build up large 
ornamental pieces. 

219. Plaster of Paris Molds. 



Are made by mixing deuiist's plaster with water 
to the thinness almost of cream, pouring it into a 
shallow box and pressing the object of which an 
impression is desired down into it. In a few min- 
utes the plaster hardens and presently the fruit, or 
Stamped or carved objpct can be withdrawn. Articles 
so used should be oiled before immersing. The 
molds should be baked at a gentle heat afterwards. 
A whole tomato or apple meld may be made by en- 
tirely covering the fruit in the liquid plaster and 
when it has hardened sawing in two and removing 
the fruit. A hole is cut into which the candy may 
be poured when the two halves are tied together. 
Gum paste is pressed eiiher with rolling-pin or pes- 
tle into shallow molds of shells, leaves and doll 
figures, which are left to dry and are afterwards 
painted or ornamented with icing. 



220. Gum Arabic Icing. 

To give to cike icing the tenacity that allows 
borders of fringe and loop work to be made on 
cakes, with strings of fine piping hanging between 
points several inches apart without breaking, mix 
with every pound of fine powdered sugar from 1 to 
2 ounces of gum arable. Powder the gum and dis- 
solve it first in a spoonful of hot water in a cjip set 
ou the side of the range, and add a little at a time 
to the icing while beating it up. The paste of gum 
tragacanth (gum dragon) as prepared for making 
gum paste can also be used in the same manner. 



The ordinary methods and means employed for 
cake and center piece ornamention having now been 
explained the writer will here state that he has a 
difi'erent method of his own, which produces orna- 
mental effects incomparably superior to the common 
clumsy pyramid of cakes or the unmeaning and 
futile temple of gum paste, and which have gained 
the admiration of some of the people whose appro- 
bation in such matters decides the question of merit. 
The new method may be fully explained with the 
aid of illustrations, in a few additional pages at soms 
future time.

^21. A Few Candies for Amateur Candy 
Pullers. 



The French confectioners recognize as many 
as twelve stages or degrees in boiling sugar, 
ranging from the " petit lisse " to the " caramel 
noir " — from simple syrup to burnt sugar caramel. 
However, we have not time to learn the degrees 
— only just a little time to make some candy. 

222. Oandy for Christmas Toys, Bto. 

2 pounds of granulated sugar. 

1 pint, or rather less, of water. 

1 large teaspoonful of powdered gum arable. 

1 level teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Flavoring. 

Dissolve the powdered gum in the water made 
warm for the purpose. Then add to the gum-water 
the sugar and cream of tartar and set on to boil. Do 
not stir the syiup after it is once well mixed. It 
should boil about 15 minutes. Then try it by drop- 
ping a little in cold water. When the lump retains 
its shape pretty well and can be worked between the 
fingers like gum paste it is ready. Pour it into the 
shallow planter of paris molds, either oiled or wetted 
to make doll figures, or figures of animals, fishes, 
etc., etc. 

This, if cast without being stirred, makes clear 
candy, but to have it white and opaque stir the 
candy in the kettle giving it only from 10 to 20 
turns with a spoon, before pouring it out. The flav- 
oring oil may be added while stirricg. Should the 
oandy set in the kettle add water and make it hot 
again, with care that the candy does not immediately 
begin to burn to caramel. 



223. Rose Cream Candy. 



The same ingredients and proportions as the pre- 
ceding receipt. Boil to the same degree. Then take 
the kettle from the fire, let it stand 5 minutes to 
lose some of its heat, and red coloring enough to 
make it pink, and a few drops of rose extract. Have 
a buttered dish ready, stir the candy rapidly with a 
spoon till it begins to change its bright appearance 
to a dull color, that is a sign of setting, then pour it 
immediately into the dish. 

224. Lemon Cream Candy. 

The same as rose cream candy. Flavor with oil 
of lemon and use no coloring. This is as white as 
cake icing. 



225. Chocolate Cream Drops. 



These are lumps of cream candy coated by being 
dipped in melted chocolate. 
Make white cream candy by the method described 



for roFe cream candy, but flavor it with va-^illa if at 
all. Pour it, hot int-> plaster of pari*} molds if you 
have them, making hazelnut sizes of drops. If no 
molds form the candy when nearly cold with the 
fingers, then taking them on a fork dip each piece in 
a bowl of chocolate, either common or sweet vanilla, 
melted by being set on the side of the range, and set 
the drops on buttered pans to cool and dry. Other 
shapes besides drops cin of course be made in the 
same manner. The boiled icings or glaze elsewhere 
described when left over from icing cakes can also 
be formed into cream drops and coated by dipping 
in melted chocolate, and so likewise can be used the 
common cake icing and macaroon mixtures*that may 
be lett over from their first purpose. 



226. Ooooanut Candy. 



Turn to receipt number 222, tabe the same ingre- 
dients and boil the candy to a degree a little nearer 
the brittle stage ; take it from the fire and put in 1 
pound of fresh grated cocoanut. Stir rapidly to 
thoroughly mix, then pour the candy thinly in a 
buttered dish. When using desiccated cocoanut 
which has no moisture to reduce the candy to thin- 
ness boil the candy only to the point named in the 
first receipt and the same as for cream candies. 



227. Almond Candy. 

1 pound or a little less of almonds blanched and 
split. 

2 pounds of granulated. sugar. 
1 pint scant of water. 

1 large teaspoonful of powdered gum arable. 

1 level teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Rose extract to slightly flavor. 

Dissolve the gum in the water made warm, add 
the sugar and cream tartar and boil without stirring 
15 or 20 minutes. When a drop in cold water sets 
nearly hard so that it can only just be pressed flat 
between the finger and thumb take the kettle off" the 
fire. Drop the flavoring by spots over the surface, 
give the candy only one or two turns with a spoon to 
mix it in, then pour it into slightly buttered pans, in 
thin sheets. Push the split almonds into the warm 
candy with the fingers. Mark it before it gets cold 
for breaking by rolling over it the edge of a thin 
dinner plate. Sliced cocoanut can be used instead 
of almonds. 

228. Stick Candy. 



Make and boil the same as in the preceding re- 
ceipt without the almonds. Pour the candy, or a 
portion of it, without stirring on to a marble slab. 
Drop flavoring over it when partly cooled, cut in 
strips and roll into round sticks. 



64 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



229. "White Sugar Candy to Pull. 

1 pound of white sugat. 

A small half pint of water. 

A half teaspoonful of cream tartar. 

1 ounce of butter 

Oil of peppermint or lemon or other flavoring. 

Boil all together, except the flavoring, about 15 
minutes. Try by dropping a little in cold water. It 
must set hard to be done. Do not stir it at all, but 
pour on a buttered dish and flavor when cool enough 
to handle. Pull it till it is quite white. 

230. Peanut Candy. 

1 pound of sugar. 

8 ounces of peanuts. 

Make the peanuts hot in the oven. Set the sugar 
over the fire in a kettle to melt without any water. 
Stir it a little. When it is all melted and of the 
color of golden syrup or light molasses mix in the 
peanuts, pour the candy into a buttered shallow pan 
and when nearly cold cut it into strips and blocks. 



231. Hickory nut and almond candy is m<»de in 
the above manner, and will be better with a pound 
of the nuts instead of half a pound. In the same 
manner with a pound of grated cocoanut a brown 
variety may be made to match the white and red 
cocoanut caramels (called also cocoanut cakes and 
cocoanut gems) described at number 151. Nougat 
is the French name of nut candies made by melting 
the sugar without water as in the foregoing receipts. 



232. Nougat Baskets— Corbeilles de 
Noix. 



The hickory nut, almond, pecan, or cocoanut 
candies made as directed for peanut candy may be 
pressed while cooling into basket shapes of tin or 
crockery ware, and sticks and twists of the same 
placed for handles and borders. Very small baskets 
formed in fancy gem pans are used to fill with straw- 
berries or other articles for ornamental purposes on 
set supper tables. For this purpose the proportion 
of nuts may ba increased to 1^ or even 2 pounds to 
1 pound of sugar. 



233. Almond Taffy. 



Called in England Everton taflFy, after a town of 
that name. 

1 J pounds of brown sugar. 

8 ounces of best fresh butter. 

1 teacupful of vinegar and water — about half and 
half. 

8 to 12 ounces of almonds. 

Scald and peel the almonds, split them and spread 
them evenly on two large dishes slightly buttered. 
Boil the other ingredients together about 15 or 20 
minutes. Shake them together at first but do not 



stir. When a drop of the candy sets quite hard nnd 
brittle in cold water take it from the fire and pour 
it evenly all over the almonds, only just deep 
enough to cover them. This kind cannot be stirred 
nor pulled, as the butter separates from the sugir 
which then turns grainy. 



234. Caramels, Plain or Maple. 

Make the candy of the preceding receipt, omitting 
the almonds. ^^ hen it has cooled on the dishes 
mark it in squares with the edge of a dinner plate 
rolled over it, and when cold cut the markings 
through, making little square blocks. 

For maple caramels use ma,ple sugar in the same 
way. 



235. Chocolate Caramels. 



1 pound of sugar — either brown or white will do 

1 ounce of butter. 
Half cup of milk. • 

2 ounces of grated chocolate. 
Vanilla flavoring. 

Set the milk, butter and sugar on to boil, and stir 
in the grated chocolate and flavoring. After that 
do not stir the mixture, again or it will go to sugar 
in the dish. Boil about 10 minutes. "When a drop 
in cold water f^^ets rather hard but not brittle pour 
the candy into a dish well buttered. Mark in little 
square blocks when set. Warm the dish or tin tray 
a little if the candy sticks. 



236. Molasses Candy to Pull. 

1 large coffee cupful of molasses, 

12 ounces of sugar, either brown or white. 

One. third of a cupful of vinegar. 

Half cupful of water. 

1 ounce of butter. 

Put all in a kettle and boil 1 o or 20 minutes, Try 
in cold water. It must boil ti 1 the drops set brittle 
and fairly snap between the fingers. Then pour 
it on buttered plates. Pul'. 



237. Molasses candy if not pulled but merely 
allowed to set on dishes is improved by having 
about a half teasponful of soda stirred in after it 
has been taken from the fire and before it is poured 
out. Flavorings may be added at the same time. 

238. Chocolate Candy to Pull. 



8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of light colored molasses or syrup. 

Half cupful of cream. 

1 ounce of grated chocolate. 

Vanilla to flavor. 

Boil the cream, molasses and sugar together about 
15 minutes, then throw in the chocolate and boil till 
the candy sets brittle in cold water. Pour on dishes, 
flavor when cold enough to handle, and pull. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



238 a. Chocolate Cream Drops. 

^ pound fine icing sugar. 

1 teaspoon ful powdered gum arabio, 

2 tablespoons water. 

1 teaspoon ful extract vanilla. 
^ pound common chocolate. 

Cut up the cake of chccolate into a tin cup and 
set in a shallow pan of hot water to melt by heat 
alone without adding any water. 

Dissolve the gum arable in the two tablespoons 
of boiling (rater in a small bowl, then stir in fine 
powdered sugar enough to make it stiff dough, ad- 
ding the vanilla at the same time. Turn it on the 
table, roll into a cord, cut off in balls size of hazel 
nuts and dip these in the melted chocolate. Set on 
a pan or dish to haiden. Makes 75 to 100. 



238 b. Chocolate Creams— Best. 

Make the white inside the same as for the pre- 
ceding and make the balls up in any shape desired. 
Instead of common chocolate merely melted dip 
them in this chocolate icing: 

1 cup sugar. 

4 tablespoonfuls water. 

3 ounces common chocolate. 
Grate the chocolate and set it on with the sugar 
and water to melt gradually in a place not hot 
enough to burn it. When it has at length become 
boiling hot beat it to thoroughly mix, and dip in the 
articles to be glazed while it is hot. 



238 c. Chocolate Cream Dominoes. 

The white cream candy same as for chocolate 
drops. Roll it out thin and pour a layer of melted 
chocolate upon it. Cut when cold. 



238 cU Mint Drops. 

1 pound pulverized sugar. 

1 heaping teaspoonful powdered gum arable. 

6 tablespoonfuls water. 

1 tablespoonful essence peppermint. 
Put the water on in a small saucepan or cup and 
the gum in it and let warm up. When the gum is 
dissolved put about a quarter of the sugar in, let 
boil up and then add half the sugar that remains 
putting it in gradually without stirring. When it 
boils again take it to the table and stir in the remain- 
ing sugar and after that the flavoring. Drop por- 
tions the size of quarter dollars on sheets of paper. 
They slip of the paper when cold. It may be nec- 
essary to add another tablespoonful or two of sugar 
to give the drops consistency enough not to run on 
the paper, yet it is better to be too thin than too 
mnch the other way. 



238 e. Wintergrreen Drops. 

The same as the preceding, but make them pink 
with a few drops of cochineal or vegetable red color- 
ing and use wintergreen extract for flavoring. 
These drops have a smooth surface but are slightly 
granulated inside. Clove drops, cinnamon drops, 
etc., same way. 



238 f. Honey Nougat. 

A moist candy to be sliced, wrapped in wa> 
tis.^ue paper. 

4 tablespoonfuls strained honey. 

2 ounced almonds, blanched. 

1 pound flour of sugar, or icing sugar. 
Make the honey hot without boiling, stir in the 
sugar a little at a time until it becomes too firm,thei> 
turn out on the table and knead in more sugar and 
also the almonds, which must be dry. When the 
nougat is firm enough to keep its form in a square 
bar like a brick split lengthwise, sugar the outside, 
roll it in wax paper and keep it a day before slicing 
it up for sale. Wrap the little cuts likewise in wax 
paper. 



238 g. Tutti-Frutti Candy. 

Take the preceding receipt and add to it a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, two figs cut small and an equal 
amount of raisins seeded and cut; work up into a 
bar with all the fine, powdered sugar necessary to 
make it firm, cut in slices and wrap in wax tissue 
paper. 



238 h. Walnut Creams. 

1 pound fine icing sugar. 

2 heaping teaspoonfuls powdered gum arabio. 
5 tablespoonfuls water. 

3 dozen walnut kernels. 

1 teaspoonful extract vanilla. 
Put a little sugar in the water to make a syrup, 
and the gum in it, stir over the fire until the gum is 
dissolved. Take it off and work in the powdered 
sugar gradually with a wooden paddle. Add the 
vanilla. The more it is stirred and beaten with the 
paddle the whiter and finer the candy becomes. At 
last turn out the lump on to the table — it is like 
soft white dough — and roll it in one long roll, out 
off slices, stick a half of a walnut kernel in each 
piece and pinch (he paste up to hold it, by shaping 
it in the hollow of the left hand. Lay the finished 
creams on a tray ||to dry. This makes about 6 
dozen. The sugar is not boiled, only the hot gnm 
syrup is used. 

238 i. Date Creams. 

The same as the preceding kind with dates cut in 
pieces to use instead of walnuts.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



238 j. Pig Creams. 

Cut each fig in six or eight pieces and proceed as 
for walnut creams. 



238 k. Angrelica Creams. 

Flavor the cream candy with extract of straw- 
berry instead of vanilla. Cut green angelica or any 
other French candied fruit of a rich color and use 
as directed for walnut creams. 



238 1. Coooanut Cream Balls. 

1 pound pulverized sugar. 

1 teaspoonful powdered gum arable, 
6 tablespoonfuls water. 

2 tablespoonfuls cocoanut, minced. 
2 tablespoonfuls currants, mi need. 
1 teaspoonful lemon extract. 

Dissolve the gum in the water hot and stir in the 
sugar gradually, flavor, fruit and cocoanut. Work 
the paste on the table with sugar until it is firm 
enough, cut oflF pieces a')d roll into balls a little 
larger than cherries. Sugar well outside and let 
dry. The same can be made with candy colored 
pink. The foregoing kinds are all easy to make be- 
cause there is no boiling of sugar. 



238 m. Cocoanut Cream Squares. 

1 pound granulated sugar. 

8 ounces cocoanut either fresh grated or desL 
oaied. 

1 small half cupful water. 
Set the sugar and water over the fire in a smal^ 
brighttkettle and boil about 5 minutes, or until the 
syrup bubbles up thick and ropes from the spoon, 
and do not stir it. Then put in the cocoanut, stir to 
mix, and when it begins to look white pour it im- 
mediately into a shallow tin p-^n. As soon as it is 
set solid mark it off, and cut in little squares when 
oold. The same kind may be colored red, and also 
be made with chocolate. 



238 n. Conmaon Boxed Macaroons. 

12 ounces almonds. 

8 ounces granulated sugar. 

4 ounces flour. 

4 eggs. Pinch of salt. 

1 teaapoonful ammonia. 
Crush the almonds without taking off the skins, 
with a rolling-pin upon the table. Mix them and 
the powder, sugar and flour together in a bowl. 
Drop the eggs in the middle and mix the whole into 
a rather soft dough. Place in lumps size of cherries 
on baking pans very slightly greased. Bake in a 



slack oven light brown. A few bitter almonds or 
peach kernels mixed in improves them. 



238 o. Fig Paste. 

3 pints of water. 

IJ pounds of sugar. 

3 ounces of corn starch. 

Juice of half a lemon. 

6 ounce of glucose. 
Boil sugar and water together and thicken with 
the starch same as in making a thickened pudding 
sauce, then put in tne glucDse and lemon juice and 
cook at the side of the range about 15 minutes. 
Color a portion of it pink. When nearly cold mould 
it into any form and roll in powdered sugar. 

The above compound is the cheap gum drop of the 
street vendors. 



238 p. Frosted Grapes. 

Take grapes of twocolor8,as red Tokays and white 
Muscadels, and pull the bunches apart into clusters 
of three or four grapes each. Prepare a platter with 
the sort of pulverized sugar known as fine granul&< 
ted, and make it warm. Whip some white of eggs 
in a shallow bowl, dip the grapes in it, lay them on 
the sugar and sift more sugar on top. L<iy them on 
sieves to dry. 



238 q. Grapes Glazed With Sugar. 

Divide some bunches of grapes into small olasters. 
Put into a deep saucepan 
1 pound of sugar. 
1 large cup of water. 
J teaspoonful cream tartar. 
Stir to dissolve the sugar, then set it on to boil as 
if for candy. 

When the syrup has boilea lO minutes try a drop 
in cold waser. When it sets so that it is hard to 
press between finger and thumb and the edges of 
drops are hard and brittle it is ready. 

Take it from the fire, dip the clusters of grapes in 
(without ever stirring the candy) 'and lay them on 
dishes slightly greased to dry. Should the candy 
become set in the kettle it may have a spoonful or 
two of water added and be made hot again. 



238 r. Frosted Oranges. 

Make plain white icing and use it to dip orange 
slices in just when it has become too thick with 
beating not to run off, and yet thin enough to settle 
to smoothness. Have a long splinter or skewer 
ready for each one. Stick the point of a skewer 
into the edge of the orange section, dip into the 
frosting, push the other end of the skewer into a 
bowl of salt, aud let the pieces hang over the edge 
of the bowl in a warm plaoo to dry.

Small Pastris 



We have now to take up and conclude the list of 
small pastries that was dropped in order that the 
book of ices might appear in the summer season. 



239. Shell Pies.orVol- au-vents of Fruit 

Crusts of pies that may be baked beforehand and 
filled with stewed fruit only as required. 

Cover the pie pan with a thin rolled sheet of pufF- 
paste, not made thinner in (he middle as for other 
pies but left of even thickness and smooth. Cut a 
mark half way through the paste all round the rim 
of the plate, with the point of a knife and also score 
across the middle. When this crust has been baked 
the lid formed by the cutting can be lifted off in two 
halves and replaced when the pie is filled with fruit. 



240. Apple Turnovers. 



Sometimes served as a "sweet entree ;" more suit- 
able to put in place of pie ; best for luncheon, pic-nic 
parties, and for sale ; a favorite form of pastry 
everywhere. 

Make the flaky pie paste with about 12 ounces of 
butter to a pound of flour, roll it out to a thin sheet 
and cut out flats nearly as large as saucers, with the 
lid of a baking powder can or similar cutter. 

Place a good spoonful of dry stewed apple in the 
middle of each piece of paste and double over in 
half-moon shape. Press the two edges together and 
crimp them with the thumb and finger. When the 
the baking pan is full of the turnovers brush them 
over with egg and water and dredge granulated 
sugar on top. Bake slowly till they are crisp, 
glazed, and of a fine reddish brown color. These 
large sizes have generally to be cut in two. They 
contain more fruit and are better eating than when 
made small. 

241. Cannelons of Fruit. 



Proceed as if for apple turnovers, but cut the 
sheet of paste into squares. Place a spoonful of 
any kind of firm fruit jelly lengthwise and roll up 
the piece of paste so to cover and inclose it. The 
word cannelon, like cane, signifies a tube with a pith 
in it. Egg over, dredge with sugar and bake. 



242. Mince Patties. 



Roll out a sheet of pie paste, or puff paste if pre- 
ferred, very thin. Cut out flats with a large biscuit 
cutter. Put a spoonful of mincemeat, or lemon 
mincemeat, or mock mincemeat, on one of the fla's, 
lay another on top and pinch the edges together all 
round. Egg them over, dredge, sugar and bake. 



243. Lemon Patties. 

May be made as above and filled with the lemon 
butter, number 39, or lemon paste. 



244. Saratoga Shortcake. 



Drain the juice from canned strawberries into a 
quart measure. To a quart allow 12 ounces of sugar 
and set it at the back of the range to simmer down 
as thick as fruit jelly. Then put in the strawberries 
aad cook a short time longer. Roll out two thin 
sheets of ordinary flaky pie paste and bake them 
on two baking pans of the same size. When done 
spread the strawberry compote on one sheet, place 
the other sheet on top — moving it by means of two 
palette knives slipped under — and over the top of 
that spread a coat of thin cake icing. Dry the 
icing in a slack oven and let it acquire a little pale 
color. Cut in squares or diamonds when cold. 



245. Almond Shortcakes. 



Chop 1 pound of blanched almonds quite fine and 
mix with them 12 ounces of sugar and the whites of 
3 eggs, making a sort of paste. A little orange or 
lemon zest may be added. Cover a baking pan with 
a thin sheet of pie paste, spread the almond paste 
evenly over it and cover with another thin sheet of 
pie paste. Egg over the top, dredge sugar over and 
bake in a slack oven. Cut in oblongs or squares 
when cold. Several of the nut creams and conserves 
may be used in the same way instead of the minced 
almonds. With a coating of icing or glaze on top 
the articles of this class made of pastry are found to 
be very saleable at the bakers' shops. 



246. Florentines or Florentine Mer- 
ingues. 

Cover a baking pan with a sheet of pie paste 
rolled out thin. Spread over the paste some green 
gqge jam, strawberiy jam, or fruit jelly, and bake 
it in a slow oven. While it is baking whip up the 
whites of from 6 to 12 eggs, and when firm spread it 
over the hot preserve. On top of the white of egg sift 
some granulated sugar and some desiccated cocoanut 
should bo strewn over that. Bake the cake about 
10 minutes more with the oven door open. Cut in 
squares when cold. 

247. English Cheesecakes. 

12 ounces of sweet rennet curd. 
4 ounces of sugar. 

3 ounces of butter. 

4 yolks of eggs. 
Pinch of salt. 

^ a nutmeg grated. 

Lemon extract to flavor. 

To prepare the curd sea number 303. Rub the 
curd as taken from the draining cloth through a 
flour seive and mash it smooth. Add the other in- 
gredients and pound them all together. Line patty 
pans with tart paste and nearly fill them with the 
mixture. Bake about 15 minutss. The curd mix- 
ture though seemingly too firm at first melts and 
puffs up in the oven. Powdered sugar over the tops.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



248. Puff Paste and Cheese, or Bame 
quins. 



To be served with stewed fruit. Make puff paste, 
but not the richest — using about 12 ounces of butter 
to a pound of flour. When it has been rolled and 
folded twice, the shortening being all in, roll it out 
again and spread grated cheese all over it with the 
palette knife. Fold and roll out and spread cheese 
on it again, and then once more. When it has been 
folded 5 times in all roll it out thin, cut in squares 
about 2J inches wide, double these squares over 
something like split rolls, egg over and bake. A 
small piece cut from the pie paste when making 
may be enough to answer this purpose. 



249. Baked Bananas for Breakfast. 

Peel the fruit and cut it in halves lengthwise 
Lay these strips in close order in a baking pan, 
strew sugar over and some bits of fresh butter and 
bake in a moderate oven about half an hour. The 
fruit should be basted while baking with a f w 
spoonfuls of butter and sugar syrup and should 
come out glazed. Serve warm. 



250. 



Crisped Bananas, Nerj Orleans 
Stsrle. 



Peel and cut the bananas in two across and steep 
the pieces in white sugar syrup flavored with cut up 
oranges and nutmeg. When they have steeped an 
hour or two roll each piece in dry flour, giving it a 
a good coating, and fry in olive oil or clarified fresh 
butter. Serve hot with the orange syrup they were 
steeped in strained for sauce. 



251. Crisped Apples. 

Gore some good apples such as easily cook soft, 
then pare them and if large out them in two. Steep 
them several hours in sugar-and- water syrup well 
flavored with lemon. Take the apples out, roll them 
over and over in flour and fry them in hot lard. 
Serve with sauce. 

Crisped pears can be done the same way if soft 
varieties of the fruit are used. 



262. French Frying Batter. 



Fine for pine apple and orange fritters, scollops, 
oysters, frogs, etc. 

12 ounce'3 of flour. 

12 whites of eggs— J pint. 

3 ounces of olive oil — 6 large tablespoonfuls 

3 ounces of white wine or sherry. 

Salt, orange or lemon zest if for fruit fritters. 

Whip the whites firm in a bowl, pour in the oil 
and wine, then add the flour by shaking in a little 
at a time. Stir till well mixed, use immediate'y. 
When this has lost its first lightness by standing in 



a warm place a pinch of baking powder beaten in 
improves it. 



253. Common Frying Batter. 



1 pint of milk. 

3 or 4 eggs. 

Little salt. 

1 large spoonful of melted butter— 1 ounce. 

Half as much syrup. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

1 pound or quart of flour. 

Put the flour in a pan, mix half the milk and the 
other ingredients, exc<'pt powder, together, and stir 
up the flour with them to smooth dough. Thin it 
with the rest of the mil.k. Beat in the powder just 
before using. Good f r egg plant in batter, as well 
as fruit fritters. Spoonfuls of it fried in lard also 
make common fritters. 



254. 



Fritters a la Creme— Breakfast 
Dish. 



A sort of sliced custard breaded and fried, made of 

1 quart of milW, 

6 ounces of sugar. 

6 ounces of mixed corn starch and flour. 

7 yolks of egg". 

2 ounces of butter. 
Flavoring. Salt. 

Boil the milk with the butter and salt in it, Ww 
the sugar in the starch and flour dry and dredge arrt 
beat them into the boiling milk. Let it cook slowly 
at the side of the range about 10 minutes. Stir in 
the yolks of eggs and take it off". Flavor with lemon, 
cinnamon, nutmeg or vanilla and let it get cold in a 
buttered pan. Roll the slices in egg, then in cracker 
me-il, fry in lard, serve warm with syrup. Any 
good corn starch or farina pudding ei her baked or 
boiled when cold can be sliced and used in the same 
way. 

265 Sponge Fritters. 

A soft and spongy sort different from the common 
made with a boiled paste. 
1 pint of water. 

4 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of flour. 

1 ounce of sugar. 

Boil ihe waier, sugar and butfer together, then 
put in the flour all at once, as if making queen 
fritters, and let the paste cook about 5 minutes. 
Then take it from the fire and work in the following 
and beat well: 

2 ounces of flour. 
Half cup of water. 

5 f ggs Flavoring of nutmeg or vanilla. 
1 traspoonful of baking powder. 

Fry spoonfuls in a saucepan of hot lard Servo 
with wine or brandy Eauce. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY OOOK.

256. 



Bread in Batter— Smothered. 
Bread. 



Pain Pkedu. 



12 ounces of flour. 

1 pint of mila. 

2 ounces of butter melted. 
2 eggs, 

1 tablespoonful of golden syrup. 

25 slices of bread — French rolls best. 

Mix the flour and milk to make a thin batter and 
add the other ingredients. Let the bread slices 
steep a minute or two in it, then fry them in hot 
lard. They should be barely masked over with bat- 
ter, not thickly covered like fritters. May be sau. 
teed in frying pans as well. Serve with syrup, 
sauce, or jelly. 

267. Fried Pies. 

Saleable in the baker's shops. Make them the 
same as directed for apple turnovers with dough not 
very rich. Use milk to mix up with and the dough 
will have a better brown color thaa with water. 
Wet the edges with egg and water to make them 
stick and keep out the grease. Drop the turnovers 
into a pan of hot lard and fry them brown like 
faitters or doughnuts. 



268. German Pancakes. 



This is an anticle specially belonging to the restau- 
rant bill of fare, for its only difiference from com- 
mon pancakes or good wheat flour batter cakes is in 
its being baked thick ; nearly as thick as the omelet 
pan is deep; and such a cake almost constitutes a 
a meal by itself. They have usually to be mixed up 
at short notice. The following is the quicKest way: 

1 pint of milk to mix up with. 
10 yolks of eggs. 

4 ounces of melted butter — 3 basting spoonfulls. 

2 ounces of syrup — 1 basting spoonful. 
Little salt. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

1 pound or quart of flour. 

1 pint more m'lk to thin it down. 

Put one pint of milk in a pan and all the other 
things with it. Stir hard, rubbing the soft dough 
smooth and free from lumps, and then add more 
milk gradually. Put a spoonful of hot lard in the 
small omelet frying pan, pour in about a cofiee cup* 




ROCKY MOUNTAIN CREAM. 



ful of batter and bake it light brown on both sides. 
Serve with butter and syrup. These cakes are 
richer made with the yolks only than when the 
whole eggs are put in. 



269. 



French Pancakes— "Jenny Lind 
Pancakes " 



1 pound of flour. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

14 eggs. 

\ pint of milk, 

I large spoonful of melted butter. 

1 pint of cream to whip. 

Half cup of brandy. 

Little salt. 

Separate the eggs and mix the yolks with the milk, 
throw in the sugar, butter, brandy and salt, then all 
the flour and mix up smooth. Whip the cream and 
mix that with the batter, then whip the whites and 
stir in. Bake thin pancakes in omelet pans. Being 
sweet they burn easily. When done on both sides 
spread a spoonful of currant jelly on the pancake 
and roll it up like an omelet. Sift powdered sugar 
on top. Or, roll up plain and serve a little jelly in 
the dish For cheaper kinds see wheat batter cakes. 



260. Petits Pates— Small Patties. 



A delicate sort of small patties have the crust 
made by frying the coating of batter that will adhere 
to a solid copper shape that is dipped into it, by im- 
mersion in hot lard. The shell can be shaken cfT 
when done and the copper wiped and dipped in the 
batter ngain for another. The batter will not adhere 
if the copper shape is made too hot. The German 
pancake batter or that made for waflSes will answer; 
the best for the purpose is the French frying batter 
made wi'h oil and wine. Fill the shells with chicken 
or partridge or other minced meat. 

The copper shape will hardly be found ready 
made Get a copper bolt made into the outward 
shape and size of a very small fluted tumbler, but 
solid, and a handle a foot or two in lergth fastened 
in the top to dip it by.

261. Apple Creamcake. 

For 4 or 6 cakes for a hotel supper take: 

3 pounds of flour — 12 cupfuls. 

2 pounds of butter or lard --4 cupfuls. 

2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 

1 quart of ice water. 

More flour to dust with. 

Rub the butter into the flour dry between the 
hands. Use salt only when lard is employed for 
shortening. Make a hollow, pour in the water^ 
mix up soft, and roll out on the table. 

It makes the cake flaky and part in layers to 
roll it and fold it a few times like pie paste. 

Roll out as thick as biscuit at last and bake on 
jelly cake pans. Split them open, spread apple 
cream thickly between and powdered sugar on top. 



262. Apple Cream. 

4 cupfuls of grated apple. 

2 cupfuls of sugar. 

Butter size of an egg. 

2 tablespoonfuls of water. 

legg. 

Flavoring of minced orange or lemon peel. 

Either grate apples on a tin grater or finely 
mince them; put the specified quantity into a 
saucepan with all the other ingredients and stir 
them over the fire about ten minutes. 



263. Covered Lemon Pie— "Without Eggs. 

8 ounces of sugar — 1 large cupful. 

3 ounces of flour — 1 small cupful. 

1 lemon 

1 pint of water — 2 cupfuls. 

Grate rind of the lemon into a small saucepan, 
using a tin grater and scraping off with a fork 
what adheres. Squeeze in the juice, scrape out 
the pulp, chop it, put in the water and boil. Mix 
the sugar and flour together dry and and stir them 
into the boiling liquor. When half thickened take 
it off and let finish in the pies. 

The above makes two large pies or three small. 
It is necessary to be particular to get the right 
amount of flour. The mixture is pale yellow from 
the rind and sugar. 

For the crust rub half a pound of shortening 
into a pound of flour, mix with cold water and 
roll out three times. Put top as well as bottom 
crust on these pies. 



264. Macaroon Cake. 

Often incorrectly ca'led macaroni cake. A spec- 
ialty at some of the fine bakeries. 

It is a sheet of cake with macaroon paste baked 
on top and fruit jelly in spots. For the cake take 



1 pound of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

6 eggs. 

1 small cupful of milk. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Flour to roll out — about 2 pounds. 

Warm the butter and sugar and stir them to- 
gether to a cream, add the eggs two at a time, 
then the milk, then the powder and most of the 
flour. Work the dough on the table by pressing 
out and folding it till it can be rolled out to a sheet. 
Roll it thin as if for cookies, cut to the size of your 
baking pans, roll up the piece of dough on the 
rolling-pin and unroll it on the pan, previously 
well greased. Bake very light colored and not 
quite done, because it has to be cooked again. 



265. Macaroon Paste. 

12 ounces of grated cocoanut. 

8 ounces of powdered sugar. 

2 whites of eggs. 

Little lemon extract. 

Stir the above ingredients together in a bowl, ihi 
sugar and whites first and the cocoanut added. 

Place the paste, either with a teaspoon or with 
a tube and forcing-sack, in long cords across thfl 
sheets of cake, and then diagonally across to form 
diamond-shaped hollows. The cord of macaroon 
paste need be no thicker than a pencil. Then bak« 
in a slack oven with the door open till top is brown. 
When cold drop spots of clear fruit jelly in the 
hollows between the ridges of macaroon paste. 



266. Macaroon Tarts. 

Line small patty pans with sweet tart paste, 
half fill with macaroon paste, made either with 
grated cocoanut or minced almonds, and bake 
slowly in a very slack oven. The insides rise round* 
ed and partially hollow. 



267. Napoleon Cake. 

Roll out two sheets of puff paste quite thin and 
bake on baking sheets. 

When done spread pastry cream (No. 285) upon 
one sheet, place the other on top of it, and finish 
the top with the pearl glaae. No. 2. Cut in dia- 
monds or squares. 

Another pastry cake of the same sort will be 
found at No. 244. 



268. Bismarcks. 

Large doughnuts of the plain sort directed at 
No. 561, with a teaspoonful of stewed fruit inside, 
cut out like thin biscuits, allowed to rise and then 
fried.

A Book of Puffs, Eclairs and Cream 
Fillings. 



Sooner or later it was morally certain these 
things would get into the papers ; the common dark- 
ness surrounding the subject and the many inno- 
cent deceptions practiced for that reason makes this 
necessary. 

For bills-of-fare may promise fairly enough, but 
there is not the least certainty that the promised 
puflf fritter will come to table puffy, and it is differ- 
ent with it than with almost anything else in this 
world ; we are accustomed to speak of hollow frauds 
and hollow mockeries, but a puff fritter is only a 
fraud when it is not hollow, and you can never 
properly call a puff fritter your "solid," unless it is 
a solid mockery of what it ought to be. 

There are at least a dozen cooks in Sleepy Hollow 
who can not make puff fritters hollow, and possibly 
the most of them do not even know what they are, 
and yet would resent any hint that they are not 
first-class cooks. But they are not the only ones. 
There was a cook of considerable repute, who ran for 
several successive seasons on that splendid steamer, 
the Aberbrothock, and he made it a point to have 
what he called bell fritters, for one of his "sweet 
entrees" always for the last dinner of the trip. 

He went through the motions of making puff frit- 
ters, and he made a nice spongy sort of an article, 
but nobody could see why it was called bell fritter, 
because it was not "hollow as a bell," and had not 
even a space inside big enough to hang the smallest 
kind of a clapper. But one day, by some accident, 
he got the proportions just right, and, to his aston- 
ishment, when he dropped the fritters into the hot 
lard, they presently began to swell. The pieces of 
the paste he dropped in were as big as goose eggs at 
first, which was entirely too large in any case, but 
he had not been used to seeing them increase much. 
But this time they swelled and they swelled, and by 
the time they had attained to the size of canteloup 
melons, and the two at the bottom had hoisted all the 
rest and were about to pitch them over, the cook 
was thoroughly scared ; he thought Old Nick was 
inside them, and, hastily seizing the saucepan by the 
handle, he threw it and the whole caboodle out of 
the cook-house window. 

Puff fritters, or, rather, the want of them, was the 
cause of a good deal of unhappiness at the Scylla 
Cottages, for several years. 

There is not a more delightful winter resort than 
the Scylla Cottages, on the dreamy Southern coast. 
It is noted the world over for its location upon the 
very verge of Percival's beautiful coral grove, where 
the purple mullet and the gold-fish rove, and is only 
a two hours' easy boat-row from the Isle of Calms, 
where the sea throws up some new and exquisite 
tropical shells every day, and Morris's folks, in pen- 
sive thought, can wander on the sea-beat shore in an 



atmosphere of perpetual Spring. But there had to 
be some eating done even in Eden, and the Scylla 
Cottages were kept as an hotel by an estimable land- 
lady. She prided herself upon her life-long experi- 
ence in housekeeping. 

Her regular patrons from the North, who arrived 
punctually each year just before New Year's, had 
discovered a spell to keep her in subjection. "What 
society shall we have this year ? Whom do you ex- 
pect?" — and then — "Have you found a cook yet who 
can make those delightful soulfle fritters? Oh, they 
make them so elegantly at Long Branch ! And you 
did not succeed with the receipt we sent you ? Dear 
me — and we procured it from one of the most cele- 
brated cooks, it must have been right. Why, they 
make them over there at the Chary bd is Hotel, per- 
haps as elegantly as our cooks do at Long Branch, 
and that is quite a splendid place, the Charybdis, 
but we seem to have become attached to this spot. 
0, if you only had a really good cook!" 

Of course these intellectual people were not in 
earnest ; nobody cares for a fritter, more or less, but 
they knew that in this way they could infuse gall 
and bitterness into somebody's life, and when they 
were good natured they played the subject for sport, 
and when they were really mean through eating too 
much green turt-e, they rung the changes for pure 
spite. They would even go over for a day or two to 
the Charybdis Hotel, which is really a very fine 
place, with splendid shell roads and two-forty nags 
to drive on them ; magnificent rows of magnolias, 
fig orchards and oranges ; but, being a literary 
and artist sort of crowd, they better liked the at- 
mosphere of the Isle of Calms, for "the nightingales 
sing round it all the day long," and the Southern 
sunsets from that point are most gorgeous. 

As to the Charybdis Hotel fritters, they were hol- 
low, it is true, but they were little, old hardshell 
things, and whenever they were served the guests 
had to be furnished with nut-crackers to break them 
with. And yet, that cook was so proud of them that 
he guarded the secret of making them from the 
boys as carefully as if he had discovered a new 
Aladdin's cave. 

He needed not have been so careful. If there 
were any use of it, no doubt but as many as fifty va- 
rieties of hollow fritters could be made. The key to 
the whole matter is this: 370. 

If you make a very stiff, smooth, cooked paste of 
flour, then work in gradually about half its weight of 
raw eggs you have a fritter paste that when dropped 
in hot lard will swell, and each piece become as hollow 
as an egg shell. Any other substance, corn starch, 
corn'meal, banana pulp, fruit pulp of any kind, cheese, 
almost anything smooth will act the same way, either 
alone or mixed with flour. We shall have more to 
say about this when we come to souffle pudding 

But these simple foundations are not particularly 
good eating, and have to be enriched. Their tenden-

cy to puff up is already at the strongest, and what- 
ever is added must be so balanced — more eggs against 
more butter and sugar — as not to destroy it. In 
things like these requiring exact proportions it may 
make a difference if the eggs used be unusually large 
or small. There is no magic in the number ; it is 
weight you want. Ten eggs average a pound. And 
it may make a difference, too, if the water be al- 
lowed to boil away after being measured. 

The receipt nextToUowing gives the kind that was 
made by the Charybdis Hotel cook, and which he was 
so afraid lest anyone should find out. They used to 
be called Baptist fritters, because they are never truly 
good until they have been immersed — in syrup. In 
campmeeting countries where they are sold on the 
grounds by measure, the statute requires them to 
weigh four pounds to the bushel. They can be made 
to weigh less if made larger. The number of eggs 
in the receipt is left optional. The Charybdis man 
only used four because they were dear, and he had 
to carefully round off the fritters as he dropped them, 
because while the rich kinds will smooth themselves 
in the frying fat, these only come out with all the 
rough corners magnified. You will like them with 
six eggs, and are not obliged to furnish nut .crackers, 
even with the other proportion. 



21\. 



Hardshell Fritters. 



1 pint of water. 

^ pound of flour. 

4, 5, or 6 eggs. 

Slight seasoning of salt. 

Bring the water to a boil in a bowl-shaped sauce- 
pan of good size ; drop in the flour all at once and 
stir to a firm, smooth paste, which will require about 
five minutes over the fire. Then take it off and, 
after letting it stand a few minutes, work in the eggs 
one at a time with a large spoon. Beat the paste up 
against the side for at least five minutes. It does 
no harm to let the paste stand an hour or two before 
frying, after it is made, but it must not be allowed 
to get cold before the eggs are beaten in. Set on an 
iron frying kettle half filled with clarified meat fat, 
and when that is hot drop in pieces of the paste 
about as large as guinea eggs. Only a few at a time. 
When done, take up with a skimmer ; drain on a 
colander or seive ; serve with syrup. Makes twen- 
ty-five. 



3TS. CORN STARCH FRITTERS. 



Balloon Fritters. 



The boss fritters of the tribe. Crisp and fine. No 
limit to their swelling capacity but the size of the 
kettle. When made of the size of footballs the ket- 
tle has to be set in the oven to finish, because they 
merely float on top of the fat and cannot cook 



through. Weigh the starch; don't trust the paok> 
ages for weight. 

1 pint of milk. 

J pound of corn starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

8 eggs. Little salt. 

These are made same way as the "hardshells," 
except that the starch has to be mixed separately. 
Boil half the milk with the butter and salt in it, and 
mix the starch smooth with the other half; pour it 
in the saucepan and stir over the fire till it becomes 
a firm paste well cooked. 

Beat the eggs in one at a time. Have fresh sweet 
lard moderately hot, and drop in pieces of the paste 
as large as guinea eggs, by pushing them off the 
point of a spoon. They need considerable time to 
fry. Serve with sauce ; transparent, wine, brandy, 
lemon or custard. Makes about twenty-five or 
thirty. 



CROUSTADES SOUFFLES. 



3T3. 



Fried Puff Borders. 



For individual entrees. Suitable to serve instead 
of Yorkshire pudding with any roasted or braised 
meat having a brown gravy. 

Make either the corn starch fritter paste or the 
queen fritter paste next following. Put it in the 
lady-finger sack and press out in piping smaller than 
a little finger, on to a greased tin lid or a baking pan 
of small size. Form the piping into oval rings the 
size required for your individual dishes. When the 
frying fat is ready, turn the lid upside down with 
the rings on it and dip them in the fat. They will 
immediately slip off and retain their shape while 
frying, but puff considerably. Where many are 
wanted at once, a baking pan does best to fry in, a 
smaller sized tin pan that will go down in it being 
used to make the shapes on. Instead of forcing sack 
and tube, a half sheet of stiff paper, made into a 
cornet, pinned, and the point cut off, will do. 
Serve hot, with the meat in the centre and gravy in 
the '"sh. 



The two following are the kinds that they made so 
elegantly at Long Branch. 

Beignet is the French word for fritter. Souffle is 
puff. Souffle is puffed. Perhaps puffed fritter 
would be better English than puff fritter, but com- 
mon usage seems to sanction the latter. 

»T4. 

Queen Fritters. Beignet Souffles. 

Sometimes filled with pastry-cream and called

1 pint of water. 
4 ounces of butter. 
8 ounces of flour. 
10 eggs. 



THE AMEKICAN PASTBY COOK.

Boil the water and butter together in a bowl- 
shaped saucepan large enough to beat the mixture 
in. Put in the flour all at once and stir over the 
fire till you have a firm, well-cooked paste. Take it 
from the fire, let it stand to lose a few degrees of 
heat, then work in the eggs one at a time with a 
spoon, and beat the paste well against the side of 
the saucepan. Fry same as the other varieties. 
They may be glazed by sifting powdered sugar on 
them and melting it by setting in the top of a hot 
oven, or else with a red hot salamander or shovel, 
held over. May be served also with raspberry vin- 
egar, lemon juice and sugar, custard, or any pud- 
ding sauce. The receipt makes forty to fifty. 

None of these fritters require any such thing as 
soda, or baking powder, or any substitute as is often 
absurdly directed ; neither do the eggs require beat- 
ing, otherwise than in the paste, as described. 

These remarks apply as well to all the baked puflFs, 
eclairs, talmouses, etc., of similar character. 

When any of them fail to puff up as expected, it 
usually requires another egg in the paste. There is 
a certain point of softness when the paste will al- 
most run out of a spoon, but not quite, that is the 
best for lightness, and is soon learned by'practice.* 



»75. SPANISH PUFF FRITTERS. 



Beignets Souffles, a la Vanille. 



All the preceding kinds are unsweetened and 
cook light colored ; these contain sugar and require 
care to prevent their becoming too dark in frying. 

1 pint of water. 

7 ounces of butter. 
3 ounces of sugar. 
10 ounces of flour. 
6 eggs, or 7 if small. 

2 teaspoonfuls extract vanilla. 

Boil the water with the butter and sugar in it, put 
in the flour and make the fritter paste same way as 
directed for the preceding kinds, adding the va- 
nilla with the last eggs. 

Fry in good lard slowly. They may be five min- 
utes before they begin to expand. Take them out 
with a skimmer ; drain on a colander ; dredge pow- 
dered sugar over and serve. Enough for average 
orders of fifty persons. 



Fritters glaces au rhum, or otheiwise, are fritters 
glazed, either with a thick sugar syrup flavored with 
rum (a rich pudding sauce) poured over them, or 
else powdered sugar melted on the fritters in the 
manner before described. 



STO, Ring Puff's With Jelly. 

For luncheon or supper. 

Make a puff fritter paste, the Spanish puff prefer- 
able, but the others will answer. Put a tube in the 
forcing sack not much larger at the point than a pen- 



cil, and half fill the sack with the paste. Squeeae 
out piping and form rings of it the size of the top of 
a coffee cup, on tin lids previously greased over with 
lard. When the frying fat is hot, dip the lids in it 
upside down and the rings will slip off. Fry them 
light brown; drain on a colander; split them all 
round with a sharp penknife ; spread jelly, or fruit 
jam, or lemon butter between the halves ; place them 
together again, dredge powdered sugar over and pile 
on a stand covered with a napkin. 



STT. Ring Puffs With Peaches. 



Make the rings asin the preceeding case. Instead 
of splitting and spreading, place them in dishes or 
saucers and half a peach on top of each, the syrup 
to be poured under. The peach halves, if the entre- 
met is to be served hot for dinner, should be baked 
for the purpose, with sugar and butter, or else 
stewed in syrup. If to be served cold, preserved or 
brandy peaches can be used. 



378. 



Bell Fritters. 



This is the way they were made by the cook of 
that splendid steamer, the Aberbrothock, when he 
made them right and threw them out of the cook- 
house window in alarm because they swelled. 

1 pint of water. 

3 ounces of butter, or lard. 

8 ounces of flour. 

5 eggs, or 6 if small. 

Make as directed for queen fritters. Good lard is 
preferable to bad butter. 



What do you do with the stale pieces of bread that 
are left over so abundantly, wherever there is an 
abundant table set and people pick and choose so ? 
Good bread; not therough, unshapely biscuits spoiled 
with inferior yellow baking bowder, top crust blis- 
tered and bottom crust soiled, so brittle and coarse 
that they crumble in the fingers, go down like saw- 
dust and leave a taste of soda and salt butter in the 
mouth, but nice slices of white bread, good rolls, 
flaky biscuits, fine grained muffins. There are about 
three-score-and-ten needs and uses for such as these 
in good cooking. In half of them nothing but bread 
will do, in the other half bread makes a good substi- 
tote for something else, as in this receipt. 



StO. 



Bread Puff Fritters.

and mash to a smooth paste over the fire — five min- 
utes — then add the butter, and when it is worked iu

take the paste from the fire and beat in the eggs one 
at a time as for other fritters. 

This makes a good fritter, but less certain to be 
hollow than others; depends on the fineness of the 
bread. 



The next, made by a different method, is one of 
the most delicate preparations of the potato. But 
there are potatoes and potatoes. It would be labor 
thrown away to use any but the best flavored and 
mealiest for such a purpose.

FRENCH POTATO FRITTERS. 



Beignets de Pomme de terre. 



Potato puree and eggs beaten light and fried. Hors 
d' auvre, (side dish) or vegetable garnish for en- 
tress, or sweet entremet with brandy sauce. 
1 J pounds of pared raw potatoes. 

4 ounces of flour. 

4 tablespoonfuls of cream. 

Same of white wine or sherry. 

6 whole eggs and 4 yolks. 

Juice of half a lemon. Nutmeg. 

Boil the potatoes well done in salted water, drain 
dry and mash them thoroughly — better through a 
colander. While still warm, mix in all the other 
ingredients except the flour. Then set the pan or 
bowl in ice- water and beat the mixture 15 minutes 
or more, like making sponge cake. When light stir 
in the flour. Fry small spoonfuls, egg-shaped, in 
hot lard. Drain on paper. Serve hot. Makes about 
60. Not hollow, but very light. 



381. Transparent Fritters. 



Crisp. White. Good to use up whites of eggs 
left out of muffins, custards, etc., wherein they do no 
good. Serve with red wine sauce, or lemon juice 
and sugar. 

^ pint of milk, or water. 

3 ounces of butter, or lard. 

3 ounces of corn starch. 

J pound of white of eggs (9 whites). 

Make as directed for other starch fritters. Fry 
slowly. If the batter is beaten too much after the 
whites are all in, the fritters are liable to explode 
when near done. (They never explode on the table 
— no danger.) 



We now come to cheese puffs and creams. In the 
great majority of instances when anything made 
with cheese appears in a bill of fare, the kind named 
is Parmesan. Besides this, the cook is directed to 
use various other foreign cheeses, according to what 
the purpose may be. In Italian cookery, one writer 
observes, "several varieties of cheese are much em- 
ployed : such as the cheese of Switzerland and Sa- 



voy, under different names; and Parmesan (named 
from Parma), though it is made in all the north of 
Italy, and particularly in Lombardy. Gruyere 
cheese is, however, most used throughout Europe; 
Parmesan is twice or thrice the price out of Italy. 
In Italy, a plateful of grated cheese is mostly served 
with the soup, when each guest takes what he likes 
and mixes it on his own plate." 

Another writer says: "My friends had two sur- 
prises of which I myself had not thought — Parmesan 
served with the soupe, and a glass of dry madeira 
after. These were two novelties lately imported 
(into France) by Prince Talleyrand, the first of our 
diplomatists, to whom we owe so many wise and 
witty sayings, etc." 

Every well regulated hotel storeroom of course has 
all the different varieties of cheese on shelf, properly 
labeled, so that the cook can have all the world be- 
fore him where to choose. But those who live where 
it is found difficult to obtain anything but American 
cheese, if they have not already read it, will be grat- 
ified and interested in reading the following, fr m 
"Practical Cooking and Dinner Giving." 

"Among the best cheeses of England are the Stil- 
ton and Cheshire ; of France, are those of Neufchatel 
Brie and Roquefort. The fromage de Roquejort is, 
perhaps, one of the most popular of all cheeses. The 
Gruyere cheese of Switzerland is also a well known 
cheese. It is made from new milk, and flavored 
with a powdered herb. The Roquefort cheese is 
made of a mixture of sheep's and goat's milk. The 
Parmesan (an Italian cheese) is made of skimmed 
milk. It is a high-flavored and hard cheese, and is 
not rent to market until it is six months old, and is 
often kept three or four years. It is extensively 
used, grated, for cooking. 

Our American cheeses, since .ne introduction of 
the factory system, are exported in immense quanti- 
ties to England, where they are much ought for, and 
considered by epicures as great luxuries. This is 
generally astonishing to Americans abroad, who, at 
home, often consider it only in rule to offer guests 
cheese of foreign manufacture. 

* ^ * * * * 

Perhaps the cheapest of the foreign famous cheeses 
is the Neufchatel. It comes in little rolls about an 
inch thick and three inches long, is enveloped in tin- 
foil and costs about twenty cents a roll. 

The tariff may be saved by purchasing the Neufchatel 
manufactured in New Jersey and Westchester County, 
New York. As for that, the Stilton made in Cayuga 
county can hardly be dected from the Leicestershire 
manufacture itself; and in fact, nearly all the famous 
cheeses are very perfectly imitated in America, so that 
those who choose may indulge in foreign names and 
encourage home manufacture at the same time." 

The moral to be drawn from the preceding *r- 
tract is that for cooking purposes at least, American 
cheese will do very well, even for dishes au Parme- 
I tan, or d la Parmesane.

Parmesan Fritters with Apples. 

383. 

J pint of water. 
1 ounce of butter. 
4 ounces of flour. 

4 ounces of cheese. 

5 or 6 eggs. 

Grate the cheese, if dry enough, or else mince it 
extremely small. 

Make the puff fritter paste by boiling the water 
with the butter in it and then stirring in the flour. 

When well cooked take the saucepan from the fire, 
add the grated cheese an d beat it into the hot paste 
with a pestle. Then work in the eggs one at a time 
and beat the mixture for several minutes. Fry 
small fritters. They swell very much and are not 
good if dark colored. When done, drain them — on 
paper if necessary — open each one with a twist of a 
fork, and put in a teaspoonful of dry-stewed apple 
seasoned with fresh butter. When the cheese is of 
a very dry sort, a little more butter is needed to 
make the paste. 



The receipt preceding and the next to follow have 
been rehabilitated from some of those delightfully 
vague instructions for making Italian or other dish- 
es, which say, "take a glass of water and a handful 
of cheese and a pounded anchovy, and some flour, 
and eggs enough to make a paste not too thin, etc ' ' 
The anchovy is for flavor and can be added or not, 
at pleasure. 



383. 



Ramequin Puflfe. 



Make the cheese fritter paste of the foregoing re- 
ceipt. 

Cut some manilla paper in broad ribbands, and 
brush them over with a little melted lard. 

Form the paste in ring shapes on these papers, by 
pressing it out of a paper cornet, or a sack. 

These are not slender rings, but more like flat 
cakes with a depression in the centre. 

Draw the bands of paper through the hot frying- 
fat and the puffs will slip off. They should be fried 
of a light color. Drain, then split them as you 
would muffins, and spread between some creamed 
cheese or fondue. Dredge a little gra ed cheese on 
top, and set the pan containing them in the top of 
the oven for two minutes before serving. Care is re- 
quired in forming the shapes not to have them too 
large, as they expand considerably. 

384. 

About Clarifying Prying Pat. 



A number of articles have now been described in 
this column that have to be fried by being immersed 
in hot fat, enough at least to cover them. As it may 
be a long time before th^v will have to be mentioned 



again, a few explanations here come in place. 

When the clear fat — possibly several inches deep 
— is skimmed off the top of the soup stock boiler and 
strained into a frying kettle, it looks clear enough 
and ready for frying. But in fact it contains a good 
deal of water and gelatinous matter that must be got 
rid of. 

When it is set on the range it soon boils rapidly, 
and inexperienced persons are apt to think that it 
is then ready to receive the articles to be fried, but 
if they are dropped in at that stage they only boil all 
away to a mush, and perhaps the grease foams over 
on to the range. If, however, the grease is allowed 
to continue boiling — it may take an hour — the water 
will all be expelled and the gelatinous matters, or 
gravy, will all be found coated over the bottom of 
the kettle. The grease is then motionless and will 
soon begin to smoke — it is hotter than boiling water. 
If now poured off into a clean saucepan, it is clari- 
fied and ready for frying in, and may be set away to 
get cold and used whenever wanted without any 
more preparation. 

If, instead of pouring it into a clean saucepan, the 
articles to be fried are put into the grease in the same 
kettle it was boiled down in, they will dissolve more 
or less of the sediment on the bottom, the grease 
will become turgid and foam over and take fire, and 
instead of the articles browning they are apt to stick 
on the bottom and the whole contents acquire a 
burned and smoky taste. Hence the necessity of 
clarifying all fat that is saved from the cooking of 
meats. 

When meats are baking in the oven, all the 
fat that may be taken out as long as there is water 
in the pan is in precisely the same condition as that 
taken from the soup stock, and contains meat gravy. 
It is then what is called drippings. 

But when the meat has become browned and the 
gravy in the pan dried and browned too, then all the 
fat that remains is clarified and will set like tallow 
when cold ; it can be poured from the pan into 
a saucepan direct, and used to fry with immedi- 
ately. 

When kidney fat, or other fat pieces of meat are 
rendered down in a meat pan, they should be treated 
just like the baked meats; cooked with a little water 
in the pan at first, but allowed to dry out and let the 
glaze be fixed to the bottom before the clear grease is 
poured off. 

Articles properly made and properly fried and 
drained afler frying have so little grease left about 
them that it is scarcely appreciated; but what they 
are liable to have about them are sickly flavors of the 
nature of vegetable oils that the frying fat may have 
gathered from other vessels. The bay leaf, onion, 
celery and herbs; the cloves, mace, lemon, or what- 
ever is put in the soup are fine whilst they are liv- 
ing flavors, but their essential oils carried over in 
the fat to the frying saucepan are not so pleasant. 
Therefore the clear fat should be saved before any 



66 



THE AMERICAN PASTBY COOK. 



of these seasonings are put in the stock pot. An or- 
ange or pineapple fritter may have had the fruit 
soaked in good wine and the batter made of the 
lightest kind, but if fried in fat from stuffed pork or 
wild fowl, the first thing the tongue will be conscious 
of will be the ghosts of departed onions. The table 
may be furnished expensively, and the bill-of-fore be 
full of French terms, yet if these little matters be 
thought too trivial there will be an indescribable 
something that will detract from the pleasure of eat- 
ing at your table. If fat containing oil of onions 
must be used, keep it for frying onions in. Beef 
fat is well nigh tasteless, and is good alone; see that 
nothing goes into the rendering pan that will in- 
jure it. 



Frangipanni-Prangipane. 



A strange trait it is, but civilized humanity al- 
ways seems to be ashamed of its subjection to the 
necessity of eating, and is always ready either to 
quarrel with its bread and butter or laugh at it. 
So strong is this tendency, that only a very few au- 
thors of the utmost independence and decided power 
have cared to treat of matters of food and drink in a 
serious manner. The nation that is credited with 
being the most highly civilized in Europe, finding 
that all its civtlization did not redeem it from the 
necessity of eating, made the best of the difficulty, 
and elevated the entire matter to a point of re- 
spect, which the other peoples acknowledge whether 
they understand or not. 

But, "Oh, if we could only live without eating!" 
is the common aspiration still. Some fanciful story 
tellers have imagined people living on air alone; 
quaffing the rich south wind as real people quaff 
wine. Others have come down a little lower, from 
airy nothings to trifles light as air. 

"That suits me exactly," says one of Disraeli's 
ladies, "I am a great foe to dinners, and, indeed, to 
all meals. I think when the good time comes we 
shall give up eating in public, except, perhaps, fruit 
on a green bank, with music." 

"It is a pity, my lord," says one of Bui wer's char- 
acters, "that we do not serve perfumes at dessert; it 
is their appropriate place. In confectionery (delicate 
invention of the Sylphs,) we imitate the forms of the 
rose an5 the jessamine; why not their odors, too?" 

"It is an exquisite idea of yours," said he, "and 
the next time you dine here we will have per- 
fumes." 

It seems likely enough that this very conceit grew 
out of the name, frangipane, by which the cream or 
custard used for filling puffs is known to French 
cooks. Thackeray, who names a cook Champig- 
non, at the same time calls a milliner Mademoiselle 
Frangipanni. 

Frangipanni was as common a perfume, it ap- 
pears, as eau-de-cologne is now. Savarin, examin- 



ing the causes of obesity, finds Lis fat neighborii 
showing a partiality for such tilings as tourte de 
frangipane, which in English is cream pie. Wor- 
cester ^finds that both these are one word, the 
Italian being frangipanna, frangipane the French, 
but that it means two things — a perfume of jasmine, 
and milk boiled down thick and mixed with al- 
monds. So, as Tommy Traddles would say, "There 
you are !" The people had a perfume which they 
admired, but it would not satisfy hunger; they made 
an almond cream and thought it so good they named 
it perfume. An obvious compromise between ethe- 
rial longings and material needs. And thus it is the 
art of cookery meets every requirement, even 
of the delicate people who really eat nothing at 
all. 

Whatever it may have been, the frangipane of the 
present time is not made with condensed milk, and 
the nearest approach to the old definition is a receipt 
that directs almond macaroons to be broken up in 
it. The compounds carrying the name are all made 
with flour, and the flavors vary. 



PASTRY CREAM OR CUSTARD. 



385. 



Prangipan 



The kind commonly used by bakers for filling 
cream puffs, etc. 
1 quart of milk. 
8 ounces of white sugar. 

4 ounces of flour. 

5 eggs. Pinch of salt. 
1 ounce of butter. 

1 tablespoonful of extract of lemon. 

Set the milk and butter on to boil. Mix the flour 
and sugar together while dry, very thoroughly, then 
sprinkle them in the milk rapidly and keep beating 
till it is well up to the boiling point again. It is 
worthless if in the least scorched. Move it to the 
side of the range and stir in the five eggs, cover and 
let simmer slowly for twenty minutes, or till well 
cooked. Flavor after cooling. 

Extra Touches. — Three ounces of fresh butter 
lightly browned in a frying pan over the fire and 
then added to the pastry-cream, gives it richness, 
and flavor of nuts. Almond macaroons may be 
broken into the milk when first put on to boil. 

Thick whipped cream can be lightly stirred into 
the pastry-cream when the articles to be filled are 
for immediate use. 

When the pastry-cream is for cream pie, or tourte 
de frangipane; or for fauchonettes, which are small, 
deep tarts nearly filled with it and meringued on 
top like lemon pies; or for cream cake, the difference 
required is only to use 8 yolks instead of the 5 
whole eggs, and make the cream as usual. The juice 
of a lemon may be added for pies. The whites of 
the eggs make the meringue.

1 quart of milk. 

8 ounces of sugar. 
4 ounces of flour. 

2 ounces of grated chocolate. 
2 ounces of butter. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract. 

Boil the milk, butter and grated chocolate to 
gether. Mix sugar and flour drj and beat them into 
the boiling milk. Stir awhile to prevent burning, 
then set the saucepan on the side of the range and 
stir in the yolks, after beating them with a spoonful 
of milk. Let cook till well thickened. Flavor with 
the vanilla when cold. 



S87, Coffee Pastry Cream 



1 pint of clear, ver strong coflee. 
1 pint of cream. 

Use these instead of the quart of milk, and make 
according to directions for common pastry-cream. 



On board ships and steamers where milk for cook- 
ing purposes can seldom be obtained, all the pastry- 
creams are made nearly as good with water. An 
ounce of butter extra is then needed. 



The reader perceives that as cream fillings a vari- 
ety of dissimilar compounds here come together. 
They are alike, however, in being each one adapted 
for several uses, for spreadin2 on toast, cakes, filling 
tarts, tartlets, pies, etc., besides filling cream puffs. 
In another point they are all alike, and one being 
learned the rest become the easier for it. They all 
have to be stirred over the fire till thickened — that 
one touch of cookery makes the whole lot kin. Five 
different English cook books contain directions for 
making the simple base of several conserves, to follow 
here presently, that is what is called there transpar- 
ent pudding, and on this side is pretty well known 
as transparent pie. Only two of the five give the 
essential point of cooking the mixture over the fire 
before the pies are filled with it, and one of these 
copies verbatim from the older one, except the 
change of a single word. One says stir till like 
buttered eggs, the other says till like batter. The 
consequence of it is that the mixture put into the 
pies raw will rise and look fine, but when done will 
go down and become like wax; whereas if previously 
cooked it remains lio;ht and delicious. 



S88. Transparent Pie Mixtm-e. 



Used also for puffs and tarts, variously flavored. 

\ pound of sugar. 

^ pound of butter. 

8 eggs. 

Nutmeg or vanilla flavor and brandy, if desired. 



Melt and stir the butter and sugar together in a 
sauce pan; add the eggs, beaten a little first, and 
stir the mixture over the fire till it is half-cooked, 
ropes from the spoon, and looks like soft butter. If 
for puffs or tartlets it may be well cooked and fla- 
vored with orange or lemon. For pies, dredge a 
little powdered sugar over the top of the mixture 
when in the crusts — helps to prevent scorching on 
top. Slow oven. Makes 4 or 5 pies. 



The French name for tarts or little pies, made 
with the preceding mixture and several variations of 
it, is dariolts. Young Quentin Durward, of Scott's 
novel, on his first arrival in France, is set down to a 
feast of a choice order, and is served with durioles in 
the second course. One English definition of dari- 
ole is a custard tart. But the nearest the English 
cooks could come to fitting it with a term was to call 
it a cheesecake. Neither term is appropriate. The 
following, one of the dariole fillings, is called in one 
place "cheesecake to keep several years." Although 
containing eggs, the keeping qualities of these prepa 
rations are such as to entitle them to be called con- 
serves. 



389. 



Lemon Conserve. 



Also called dariole filling, lemon custard, lemon 
cheesecake, lemon paste, lemon honey, etc. For 
filling small puffs, tartlets, pies, and spreading on 
larger cakes. 

1 pound of sugar. 

5 or 6 lemons. 

4 ounces of butter. 

8 yolks and 1 Whole egg. 

Put the butter and sugar in a bright saucepan, 
grate the yellow rinds of the lemons into i^ with a 
tin grater, scraping off with a fork what adheres; 
sqeeze in the juice without the seeds, then stir over 
the fire till the mixture boils. Beat the yolks and 
mix them in and stir about ten minutes more, or 
till cooked and thick like melted cheese. 

Lemons that are green, tliick-skinned and acrid 
are not fit for this purpose. 

It is a rule useful to remember that these mixtures 
seldom if ever scorch when they have butter in 
them; they may be left to simmer at the side when 
time presses. 

200, Conserve aux Amandes. 



For small puffs, almond cream cake, tartlets, etc. 

8 ounces of almonds. 

\ pint of water. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of butter. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

6 bitter almonds and a little rose extract, if they 
are convenient. 

Scald the almonds and take off the skins, then 
chop them fine. 



THE AMERICAN PASTKY COOK. 



Boil the sugar and water to a thick syrup; stir 
n the minced almonds and the butter and boil five 
minutes. 

Then stir in the yolks of eggs and take the mix- 
tureoflFthe fire when they thicken. Add the rose 
flavor when cold. 



1391. 



Coooanut Conserve. 



8 ounces of grated cocoanut. 

^ cupful of milk, or water. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of butter. 

Whites of four eggs. 

Thin pared yellow rind of ^ an orange. 

Mince the orange peel and boil it with the sugar 
and milk. Stir in the cocoanut, the butter, and 
the beaten whites last. Take the mixture off" when 
it thickens. 

The two preceding kinds give a yellow and a 
white nut cream or conserve, very useful and orna- 
mental for spreading between layers of snow cake. 
Pistachios and hickory nuts can be substituted for 
either of the other kinds. Can be thinned with 
milk if too firm when cold. 

It is seldom necessary to keep any such compounds 
as these in hotel work for any length of time. The 
quantities prescribed are for the usual daily require- 
ments of 50 persons. It should be remembered, 
however, that sunlight turns butter rancid, and 
anything containing it should be kept dark in cov- 
ered jars. 



Florida Jam. 



"Florida shall be the name of this new land," 
cried Ponce de Leon, "for, in truth, it is a flowery 
land. What sayest thou Padre Rotundo?" 

*'As thou sayest I say. Florid is the red-bird 
flitting through the green bushes; florid the flamingo 
in the swamp; florid the sea weeds were that floated 
about our vessel as we passed yon enchanted islands 
set in a luminous sea." 

"Beautiful isles of the sea," murmured Gonzalez. 

"Beautiful gems of the ocean," sighed Leonardo. 

"Surely," went on Ponce de Leon, "they are the 
veritable isles of the blessed that we thought were 
but fables of the ancients, and this is the garden of 
the Ilesperides." 

"No gold, no gold," groaned Sebastiano, throwing 
down his prospecting pan and pick, "I have delved 
among the sands of yonder shore and found naught. 
Padre Rotundo, thou sayest these shell mounds show 
that this land was once the ocean's bed, show us, 
then, where lie the wrecks of ancient ships gold- 
laden; or, Padre, show us the streams that flow 
down from El Dorado." 

"And if," said Ponce de Leon, pursuing his own 
train of thought, "this be the garden of the Hesperi- 
des, somewhere in its glades exists the fountain of 



perpetual youth. That will I find. Perish thy 
thoughts of gold." 

"I am with thee in that search, Don Leon I" 
exclaimed Leonardo. "Oh, would I were a boy 
again!" 

"Listen to the mocking-bird," said Ponce de 
Leon. 

"Aye," answered Leonardo, "and the woodpecker 
tapping the old hollow tree." 

"And the voice of the turtle is heard in the land," 
chimed in the oily voice of Padre Rotundo. 

"Land of love and sunny skies, bright with joy 
and beauty," exclaimed Leonardo. 

"Sebastiano, what ails thee," asked Gonialez, 
"why blinkest thou at. the sky?' 

"Oh, 'tis nothing; but a jay bird sat majestic on 
yon hickory limb, and when he winked at me should 
I not wink at him ? Perhaps he knows where there 
is gold." 

"Gold I believe in when I see it, but in omens 1 
do not believe." 

"I do. I had a dream the other night when every- 
thing was still — " 

"A fig for thy dreams." 

"By our good Saint Augustine," said Padre Ro- 
tundo, "as thou saidst figs, we will have some figs. 
Bring me the figs of Smyrna that remain in the 
boat, and we will plant the seeds. Haply in this 
genial land the fig will prosper, and many that come 
after us shall bless us. Yea, my son, there shall bfe 
in this land fountains and streams of perpetual 
youth. They shall flow from the North and West 
and East, arid be of many generations. In magnolia 
parks and orange groves and by the river St. John's, 
eyes shall look love to eyes that speak again; and 
there shall be many a sly flirtation by the light of 
the chandelier in the halls of And 

there shall be gold, Sebastiano, but not for thee. The 
hotel-keepers of the future shall see it. Gold and 
letters of credit from the frozen North. Golden or- 
anges, too, that shall make this land wear a likeness 
to the gardens of thy native Seville." 

"Padre," said Ponce de Leon, drawing near and 
speaking in a low tone, "dost remember the convent 
garden near Seville, into which we stole, thou and I, 
when we were small boys, to see thy sister once 
more ? And dost remember the spicy breeze that 
was wafted to us from the refectory, where the sis- 
ters were preparing confections and conserves of or- 
ange flowers? And dost remember how they caught 
us and made us work till our arms did ache, at 
pounding orange rinds in a mortar; whilst thou 
didst nearly roast at stirring orange jam?" 

"Tut, tut," returned the Padre, "I choose not to 
remember such undignified incidents. Yet if thou 
wilt, thou mayst compare the delicate fancy of those 
good women for confections made of flowers, with 
the cruel extravagance of the pagan Romans who 
desolated the groves, and made costly dishts of the

tongues of thousands of singing birds, and thou 
wilt concede the finer grace of the later day." 

But Ponce de Leon had not been listening. His 
thoughts were far away, and he sighed, "Her bright 
smile haunts me still.' 



8»3. Florida Conserve of Oranges. 



For darioles, mountain cakes, eclairs auz confitures^ 
tartelettcs a V orange, etc. 

1 pound of sugar. 
4 large oranges. 

2 or 3 lemons — juice only. 
4 ounces of butter. 

6 yolks and 2 whole eggs. 

1 teaspoonful of extract of rose 

Put the sugar and butter in a bright saucepan; 
grate in the yellow rinds of the oranges and add an 
ounce of candied orange flowers, if you have them. 
Squeeze in the juice of the oranges and lemons with- 
out the seeds, and stir the syrup thus made over the 
fire till it boils. Beat the eggs and yolks a little, add 
them and let cook till the mixture becomes thick — 
about ten minutes. Add the rose extract after 
cooling. 



An ancient, cheap, but laborious way of making a 
conserve of oranges or lemons, is to boil the rinds in 
two or three waters for several hours, to extract the 
bitter taste and make them tender; then pound them 
to a paste in a mortar and boil the paste with either 
honey or syrup. 



A large proportion of the area of the Bahama Is- 
lands is devoted to the cultivation of pineapples. The 
appearance of the broad expanse of young fruit with 
its clusters of delicately-tinted, but sharp and ser- 
rated leaves, rising only a short distance from the 
ground and covering the undulating fields, produces 
a very remarkable effect. As many as 1,500,000 of 
the fruit have been collected from a single acre 



393. Corn Starch Pastry Cream. 

1 pint of water or milk. 
6 ounces of white sugar. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
2 ounces of butter. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

Flavoring. 

Boil the water or milk with the sugar in it. Mix 
the starch with a little water extra; pour it in the 
saucepan and stir up. Then before it has boiled 
again, add the eggs and butter and stir till the mix- 
ture becomes quite thick — perhaps ten minutes. 
Flavor when cool. 

Variation. — A small ripe lemon cut in shreds — 
the seeds thrown away — boiled with the sugar and 
water, makes or the preceding a lemon cream pie 



filling. It should be only half-cooked over the fire, 
and allowed to set in the pies in the oven. 

S94. 



Creamed Cheese. 



For filling cheese puff fritters — betgnets auparme- 
san— for ramequin puffs, canapes au/romage, etc. 

8 ounces of cheese. 

4 ounces of butter. 

1^ pint of milk. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

Little cayenne pepper and salt. 

Grate or mince the cheese very fine; put it and al 
the other ingredients in a saucepan and stir over the 
fire till it becomes thick and just begins to boil; but 
it must not quite boil, as that would spoil it. 

As the good quality of this preparation is depend- 
ent upon its being made only just before it is to be 
served, and cheese grating is one of the tedious 
operations, it will be found, for hotel use, more ex- 
peditious to pound the cheese and butter together, 
slightly warmed, then pour in milk and yolks and 
stir till thickened. Can be used as a sauce with 
Italian fritters, made a triflle thinner. 

S05. 

Cheese Fondu, or Melted Cheese. 



For Welch rare-bits, canapes au fromage, etc. 

See preceding receipt for creamed cheese, and 
substitute ale for the milk. Either of the ways an- 
swers for all the purposes of the other. 

For canapes, spread the mixture on toast, and put 
in the oven three minutes before serving. 



The preceding form of melted cheese is also one 
form of the fondue, which does not come under the 
present category. It may be noted in passing, how- 
ever, that the fondue of which Savarin thought so 
much, was more like a dish of scrambled eggs with 
cheese, having no ale or other liquid added. He 
says it is of Swiss origin, and that the cayenne is not 
to be forgotten, that being a characteristic of the 
dish. He made his fondues, when entertaining a 
few friends, in a chafing dish over a spirit lamp. 
His rule would be singularly inappropriate in an ho- 
tel entertaining five hundred people. He says al- 
low one egg for each guest, one-third as much 
cheese and half that of butter, etc. But it illus- 
trates the idea underlying small bills of fare, that 
every person Avill partake of the one dish, if that 
one dish be made of surpassing excellence. 



The reader perceives that as cream fillings a vari- 
ety of dissimilar compounds here come together. 
They are alike, however, in being each one adapted 
for several uses, for spreading on toast, cakes, filling 
tarts, tartlets, pies, etc., besides filling cream puffs. 
In another point they are all alike, and one being

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



A BOOK OF PUFFS, ECLAIRS AND 
CREAM FILLINGS—Conoluded. 



If a list had to be made of the articles of pastry 
held highest in popular esteem, cream puflfe would 
be found somewhere near the beginning. The pop- 
ular name, Boston cream puffs, might lead to the 
supposition that they are of American origin, but, 
far from it, there is so little in our trade that is new 
that I have a private opinion that Pharaoh's baker, 
the one who befriended Joseph, knew how to make 
them just as well as we do. There are many finer 
and more delicate articles that meet with less appre- 
ciation, and when we find a thing so prone to disap- 
pear, not only from the baker's windows, but from 
well-set supper, lunch and dinner tables, too, as 
cream puflFs are, it is the part of good policy to see 
how we can make the best of them. There is more 
wit and humor in these puflFs than in anything else we 
make If it were not for this they would be in still 
greater request than they are. Wit is defined as 
something which startles by its unexpectedness. Wit 
often runs to practical jokes. When a person eating 
in haste, as the majority do, takes a bite of a puff 
that is filled with a cream insufficientfly cooked and 
consequently in a fluid state, and the said cream is 
unexpectedly propelled this way and that way over 
his apparel, the wit of it may be apparent to all, but 
is sure not to be relished by the victim. This sort 
of wit should be discouraged, to which end the vari- 
ous cautions about the proper preparations of the 
pastry creams have already been given. Humor is 
not so objectionable, and when pure most people en- 
joy it. It is defined as a faculty of kindly pleas- 
antry. The humor of cream puffs is seldom un- 
mixed. 

There is humor, but not of a kindly sort, in giv- 
ing a plate of empty puffs to a hungry beggar and 
watching the falling of his countenance when he 
discovers their emptiness; and there is humor in 
setting a plate of the same before the hotel boarders 
who habitually pick and peel the crust off everything 
before them — off the bread and rolls and corn bread 
— the tops of the pies — the brown outside froa ell 
the meats — but this is humor of the kindly sort, as 
it makes such people happy to have something that 
they may peel, and be welcome, and leave no waste 
behind. 



eggs one at a time. Drop small spoonfuls of the 
paste on baking sheets very slightly greased, allow- 
ing an inch or more of space between them, and bake 
in a moderate oven about 20 minutes. Cut a slit in 
the side and fill the puffs with pastry cre>»m. Makes 
40 to 

S»T. 

To the best bakers who make them in large quan- 
tities daily, there is nothing easier than cream puffs, 
but it is not the less true that they are "mighty un- 
certain" where made only occasionally and baked 
in the uneven heat of a cooking range, instead of an 
oven. 

A very ordinary workman, 1 once knew, traveled 
as a first-class pastry cook from town to town on the 
strength of a knack he had of making these trifles in 
greater perfection than anybody else. It was his 
one trick, but it stood him in good stead for short 
spells. 

The more the paste is beaten up against the side 
of the pan as the eggs are added, and after, the more 
the puffs^will expand in baking. 

When they are perfect they are nearly smooth and 
look like small cauliflowers, whence, perhaps, comes 
one of their French names. To make them so, the 
paste must be almost soft enough to run out of shape 
on the pans; another egg may be required. 

It is safer to use a little less lard or butter and a 
little more flour than the receipt, for a first trial. 

The puffs will not rise at all if the paste be al- 
lowed to become cold before the eggs are beaten in- 
to it. 

The handsomest puffs are those baked done with- 
out the ove'' door ever being opened in the mean- 
time.

Oroam Puffs. 



Boston cream puffs of the baker's shops. Eclairs 
d la crSme, Profitiolles, Petits — ckoux, etc. 

1 pint of water. 

^ pound of lard or butter. 

J pound of flour. 
10 eggs. Little salt. 

Bring the water to a boil with the lard and salt 
in it. Put in the flour all at once, and stir the mix- 
ture over the fire about five minutes, or till it be- 
comes a stiff paste. Then take it off and beat in the

Finest. The name, eclair, is probably from the 
French word signifying a gap or clear place These 
became Sclairs au chocolat, or au cafe, according to 
the cream used for filling. Peiits-ehauz d la comtesse 
are small puffs dipped in chocolate icing and the 
coating dried on them before serving. 

1 pint of milk. 

6 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of corn starch. 
10 eggs. 

Boil half the milk with the butter in it. Mix the 
starch with the other half. Pour both together and 
cook to a smooth paste. Add the eggs one at a time 
— after removing from the fire and allowing the paste 
to fall below boiling heat — and beat thoroughly. The 
pieces of paste dropped on the baking pans should 
not be larger than guinea eggs. Makes 50.

Transparent Puffs. 



These rise in shape like bells, or inverted tea- 
cups. 
1 pint of water. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



11 



2 ounces of butter. 

6 ounces of corn starch. 

6 whole eggs and 4 whites. 



300. Ooooanut Puff Balls. , 



Eclairs au caramel. Excellent for set tables, for 
ball or concert suppers, and not too common. It is 
extremely wrong, however, to thus sugar-coat co- 
lapsed, dumpy, or burnt-up failures of puflfs, and 
try to pass them off as eclairs au caramel. The 
French never do that way, (we hope.) 

Make the desired number of cream puffs of 
whichever mixture you have the best success with. 

They are not to be filled with anything. They 
should be small, light-baked, but dry, smooth and 
hollow, and either round or egg-shaped. Roll them, 
after baking, first in thick sugar syrup and then in 
grated cocoanut mixed with granulated sugar on a 
plate. Dry the puffs in a warm place, that they may 
not be sticky when served. 

To make the syrup, pour half a cup of water on a 
pound of white sugar, and let it boil up without 
stirring. Chopped almonds can be used as well as 
cocoanut. 



301. Eclairs aux Confitures. 



Sweet cream puffs variously shaped and filled with 
fruit jelly, conserve, or any kind of sweetmeat. 

1 pint of water. 

7 ounces of butter. 

3 ounces of sugar. 
10 ounces of flour. 

6 or 7 eggs. 

1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract. 

Boil the water with the sugar and butter in it, 
then stir in the flour and make the paste as directed 
for the preceding varieties. 

Fancy shapes are made of this paste by using a 
lady-finger sack and tubes, to form fingers, cres- 
cents, etc., and egging and sugaring them before bak- 
ing. 



CHEESE PUFFS WITH ANCHOVY 
BUTTER. 



30S. Bamequins a 1' Italienne. 

^ pint of milk or water. 

2 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of flour. 

4 ounces of cheese. 

6 eggs. Salt. 

Make the paste of milk, butter and flour, as for 
cream puffs, and mix in the cheese — previously 
grated or minced — by pounding smooth while hot. 
Add the eggs one at a time. Place on the baking 
pans in small oblong shapes, and bake carefully. 
They are not good if in the least dark colored. Makes 
about 30. For filling, mix 4 ounces of fresh butter 



witfi 6 tablespoonfuls of essence of anchovies, both 
slightly warmed, and then made cold before using. 



The English ruralists are great at making cheese- 
cakes in variety. A kind of tart made of sweet milk 
or cream curd is the genuine sort, and holds about 
the same relative importance at the well-provided 
tables of the better class that pumpkin pies do on 
this side. The scarcity of English culinary terms, 
however, has made cheesecake a name expansive 
enough to take in a number of French knick-knacks, 
such as the following, which only come in turn be- 
cause they are cream curd puffs. 

303. 

Nothing can be made of milk curd, successfully, 
unless the curd be scalded to firmness so that it can 
be pressed dry; a point that our receipts, as we find 
them, hardly ever mention. Curdle the milk or 
cream with rennet as if for cheese; then set the pan on 
the range and slowly come to the boiling point. Pour 
off the whey and hang up the curd in a napkin to 
drip dry, and then slightly press it. That is what 
is meant by "well-prepared, firm curd," and a num- 
ber of good things, to be described at some other 
time, can be made of it without fear of disappoint- 
ment. 



304. Cheese Curd Puffs. 



Cheesecakes. Petits Talmouses au Parmesan. 

6 ounces of cream or milk curd. 

^ pint of milk or water. 

2 or 3 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of flour. 

4 ounces of grated cheese. 

6 eggs. 

Some pie paste for the bottoms. 

Of these ingredients make a paste the same aa for 
cream puffs, the curd and grated cheese to be pounded 
into it while hot. Roll out pie paste, the thinner 
the better; cut out flats with a biscuit cutter; place 
a teaspoonful of the paste in the middle of each, wet 
the edges and pinch them up in shape of a conti- 
nental three-cornered hat, inclosing the curd paste 
within. 

Brush them over with egg and water and bake in 
a moderate oven about 15 minutes. They expand 
in baking and become hollow. May be filled with 
creamed cheese. 



305. 



Cream Curd Puffs. 



Cheesecakes. Talmouses d, la creme. 

The same in form as the last, but sweet. Inclose 
a spoonful of the curd paste in a pastry bottom; egg 
over and dredge with sugar. 

6 ounces of cream curd. 

^ pint of milk. 

1 ounce of sugar. 



72 



THE A3MEERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



2 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of flour. 

5 eggs. Salt. 

2 teaspoonfuls of flavoring extract. 

Pie paste for the bottoms. 

Make a cooked paste as for cream pufts — the but- 
ter and sugar boiled in the milk — flour stirred in, 
then the curd; the eggs beaten in one at a time, and 
flavoring added last. 

These puff's can be partially filled with any of the 
creams or conserves, for making which, the direc- 
tions have already been givea. 



300. Pineapple Conserve. 

1 can of pineapple. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

1 ounce of butter. 

2 eggs. 

Reduce the fruit to a pulp by mashing in a bright 
saucepan; add to it half the juice from the can and 
the sugar and butter. Boil; add the eggs, and stir 
over the fire a few minutes, till thick. 

One pound of grated, fresh pineapple and a half 
cup of water answers the same as the canned. Sim- 
mer with the sugar till cooked and transparent- 
ooking, then finish like the other. 



30?. 



Cuban Conserve. 



For Cuban cream cake, Sclairs aux confitures, 
bouchees, etc. 

1 pound of sugar. 

8 ounces of fresh, grated cocoanut. 
4 or 5 oranges. 

2 lemons.^ 

4 ounces of butter. 

8 yolks of eggs, 

Grate the yellow rinds of all the fruit and squeeze 
the juice into the sugar, carefully excluding the bit- 
ter seeds. Boil the syrup thus made; add the but- 
ter and cocoanut; boil again, then beat in the yolks. 
Cook five minutes more. 

Desiccated cocoanut does as well; steep it first in 
•nilk enough to barely moisten it. 

308. 

The Best Mince Pies in the "World. 



It is not so difficult to make good mince-meat as 
to make the pies healthful and enjoyable after it is 
made. Mince pies, too frequently, in hotels where 
the desire is to make them rich, are made so that 



they are little better than dabs of sweetened grease. 
The finest pufF-paste is not suitable for them, but a 
medium quality should be made. The edges will not 
rise on mince pies much in any case, and rich puff"- 
paste is lost upon them. They have the poorest ap- 
pearance of any pies if baked plain, but can be 
made most inviting by being glazed. 

But don't paint them with yellow smears of egg- 
yolk. Mix the yolk of an egg thoroughly with 
twice as much water; brush the tops of the pies over 
with it before baking; sift a very thin coating of 
granulated sugar all over, and then bake in a mod- 
erate oven till the bottoms are baked dry and light 
brown, and the tops are covered with a crisp, glazed 
crust. Mince pies should have both bottom and top 
crusts rolled quite thin; otherwise the superfluous 
pastry edges are invariably thrown away. 



309. Mince-Meat a la Royale. 



Strictly first-class in all its appointments. 

2 pounds of lean roast or boiled beef. 

2 pounds of suet. 

2 pounds of apples. 

2 pounds of currants. 

2 pounds of seedless raisins. 

2 pounds of brown sugar 

1 pound of candied citron, 

2 ounces of ground spices — mace, nutmeg, cinna- 
mon and cloves. 

1 or 2 cans of Bartlett pears, with the juice. 

2 pounds of preserved ginger 

12 oranges— juice and grated rind. 

6 lemons — juice and grated rind. 

1 pint of rum. 

1 pint of brandy. 

1 quart of port wine. 

Chop all the ingredients small. Don't grind them 
in a machine. Then mix everything together — the 
dry articles first, and liquids poured over them. Put 
the mince-meat in jars, cover close, and let stand a 
week or two before using. 

When preserved ginger cannot be had, boil half a 
pound of common race ginger in syrup made with 2 
lbs. of sugar in 2 quarts of water. When boiled 
down to one quart, put the syrup in the mince, and 
further extract the ginger flavor by pouring the 
port wine upon it and making warm. This ginger 
is not to be used in the mincc-meat, only its ex- 
tracted flavor. 

When the oranges furnished are ripe and thin- 
skinned it is better to chop half of them after 
squeezing, and add them to the mince, instead of 
only gratirg. Grate the rest and use the juice of 
all after excluding the seeds.

quantity of strictly medicinal old port wine instead. 
The spirit evaporates in baking. 

4 lemons. 

2 pounds of white sugar. 

2 pounds of currants. 

1 pound of seedless raisins. 

2 pounds of suet, 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices. 

^ pint of brandy and port- wine mixed. 

Use lemons that are ripe thin-skinned, not harsh 
and bitter. Boil them in a quart of water till the wa- 
ter is half boiled away. Then squeeze the juice into 
the sugar, throw away the seeds, and mince the 
lemon rinds small. 

Cut or chop the raisins, mince the suet fine and 
mix all the ingredients together. Keep in a covered 
jar. 

The -srater the lemons were boiled in should be 
added to the mince. This quantity makes about 20 
pies, according to size. 

311. Bnglish Standard Mince-Meat. 



2 pounds of lean roast or boiled beef. 

2 pounds of suet. 

2 pounds of apples, 

2 pounds of currants. 

2 pounds of seedless raisins. 

2 pounds of brown sugar. 

1 pound of candied citron. 

J pound of orange or lemon rinds, previously boiled 
tender. 

2 ounces of ground spices — mace, nutmeg, cloves 
and cinnamon. 

3 quarts of sweet cider. 

1 quart of common brandy. 

Chop the meat and suet fine, and season them 
with a little salt and pepper. Cut the citron in 
small bits, mince the lemon rinds, and chop or cut 
the raisins. Mix all together and let stand two 
weeks before using. If too dry, wine, cider or 
brandy, or all mixed, should be added when the pies 
are filled. Candied orange or lemon peel, of course, 
can be used instead of the stewed peel, but costs 
more and gives less flavor. This is enough for 50 or 
60 pies, according to size. 

With a standard like the foregoing receipt to start 
from, anyone can vary the qualityand cost of mince 
meat, according to circumstances. Apples in excess 
make it poor and insipid. Raisins, currants and 
orange peel, and wine or sweet cider, make it rich. 
The meat is only a foundation. Cheap mince-meat 
is made by dosing with ground spices, and leaving 
out the more expensive materials. 

318. Good Common Mince-Meat. 



2 pounds of minced beef or tongue. 

3 pounds of suet. 

4 pouunds of currants. 



3 pounds of apples. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 pound of brown sugar. 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices. 

1 pound of candied citron, or the same of orange 
and lemon rinds boiled tender. 

1 pint of common brandy. 

3 quarts of cider, or enough to make it juicy. 

Put the raisins in whole. Mince all the rest, sea- 
soning the meat and suet a little with salt and pep- 
per. Should be kept 3 or 4 weeks before using. 
Makes about 40 or 50 pies. 

Nothing is saved by buying trashy currants. They 
have to be well washed and picked over free from 
stones, and the more dirt there is the more will wash 
away. Some currants are like small raisins, nice 
and clean and large. There is no waste in them. 

To Clean Currants. — Put them into a colander 
with holes not too large; set that down in a pan half 
full of warm water and stir the currants about vigor- 
ously. The dirt will go through the holes. Pour 
the water away two or three times. This is the 
quickest plan and most thorough. Spread the cur- 
rants out in a baking pan; pick them over and let 



them dry for use. 



314. 



To Clean Raisins. — When sultana seedless are 
furnished, or even the larger kind of seedless rais- 
ins, put them in a colander with a handful of flour 
mixed in, and rub off the fine stems, which then by 
sifting about will fall through the holes. When the 
greater part have been so got rid of, the raisins must 
be picked over separately, especially to remove the 
gravel stones that may chance to be among them. 
Layer raisins have to be seeded to be good in any- 
thing. A most tedious operation and requiring such 
help as can be had. 



Some thirty years ago the English Vegetarians 
made a good deal of noise in the world. Their head- 
quarters was in the Channel Islands, where their 
representative paper was published. It was called 
the Vegetarian Banner and Manx Healthtan Journal. 
Its motto was "Fruits and Farinacea, the Proper 
Food of Man." Its leading idea was, that absti- 
nence from meat diet would make the worli better. 
Those who supported it set themselves to work earn- 
estly to get up a new system of cookery wherein 
meat should have no place, and a great many curi- 
osities in the way of billsof-fare of dinners without 
meat were published in it in consequence. The an- 
nexed is one of their receipts. The cider excepted.

J pound of currants. 

\ pound of seedless raisins. 

1 pound of brown sugar and molasses mixed. 



74 



THE AllCEBIOAN PASTR7 COOK. 



A little salt and pepper. 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices — cinnamon, mace, 
cloves and alspice. 

I pound of crushed crackers or dry bread crumbs. 

1 pint of cold water. 

J pint of vinegar or hard cider. 

2 tablespoonfuls of lemon extract, 
f pound of butter, melted. 

4 beaten eggs. 

Mix all the dry articles in a bowl, then add the 
fluids to the eggs, and pour over and mix in the 
melted butter by hard stirring. The proportion of 
molasses to sugar may be according to kind. All 
syrup will do. Make like other mince pies. A 
half pint of brandy added makes the resem- 
blance very close. Makes about 10 pies, more or 
less, according to size. 



310. Cheapest Good Mince Meat. 

Suitable for charitable institutions, etc., and not 
easily distinguishable from the costlier mixtures. It 
will not intoxicate. 

1 J pounds of bi'ead. 

1 pound of boiled beef or ox heart. 

2 pounds of brown sugar. 
1 quart of good molasses. 

1 pound of common dried apples. 

IJ pounds of suet. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 pound of currants. 

4 ounces of ground cinnamon and other spices 
mixed. 

1 ounce of black pepper. 

1 pint of vinegar. 

Peel of 2 or 3 oranges. 

1 tablespoonful of salt. 

Pour two quarts of cold water over the bread; 
steep and mash. Boil the apples in two quarts of 
water, then chop them and add the j nice to the rest 
of the ingredients, all minced and mixed as usual. 
The orange peel should be boiled a little while and 
then minced fine. Any stewed fruit liquor or cider 
can be added with advantage. Makes 2 gallons — 
30 to 50 pies. 

317. Finger Biscuits. 

14 ounces of granulated sugar — 2 cup»- 

8 eggs. 

6 tablespoonfuls of water. 

12 ounces of flour — 2 heaping cups. 

Separate the eggs, the whites into a good sized 
bowl, the yolks into the mixing pan. Put the su 
gar to the yolks and stir up then add the water and 
they can be beaten to a thick foam. It may take 
10 minutes. Have the flour ready. Whip the 
whites with the wire egg-whisk till they are firm 
enough to bear up an egg Mix the flour in the 
yolks and stir in the whipped whites last. , 



Lay the mixture in small finger-lengths with a 
lady -finger tube and sack or a paper cornet, on a 
sheet of blank paper. Sift powdered sugar over 
them plentifully, catch up two corners of the sheet 
and shake off the surplus. Lay the sheet on a bak- 
ing pan. 

Bake about 6 minutes. Take off by wetting the 
paper under side and stick the cakes together while 
they are still moist. 

318. White Jelly Drops. 

The same mixture as number 3. Make drop 
cakes same as lady fingers, well glazed by letting 
the siftings of powdered sugar lie upon them a few 
minutes before baking. 

When done sandwich a slice of good wine jelly 
between two, and keep cold until time of serving. 

319. Star Kisses. 

1 pound of fine granulated sugar. 

8 whites of eggs 

Flavoring extract. 

Whip the whites with a bunch of wire in a cold 
place until they are firm enough to bear up an egg, 
add the sugar and flavor and beat a few seconds 
longer. Put the meringue paste thus made into a 
sack and star-pointed tube or else into a stiff paper 
cornet having the point cut like saw teeth and press 
out portions size of walnuts on to pans slightly 
greased and then wiped clean. Bake in a very 
slack oven about 10 minutes or till the kisses are of 
a light fawn color and swelled partially hollow. 
They slip off easily when cold 



320. Frozen Fig Pudding 

Figs cut small and mixed in caramel ice cream 
and frozen in brick molds in a most excellent com- 
bination — a modified tutti frutti. 

1 quart of milk. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

14 ounces of sugar. 

1 pound of figs. 

The caramel gives the flavor, but half a cupful of 
curacoa improves it. 

Take four tablespoonfuls of the sugar to make 
caramel, put it into a saucepan or frying-pan over 
t,he fire without any water, and let it melt and be- 
come a medium molasses color, not burnt, however, 
then pour in half a cupful of water, and let boil 
and dissolve. 

Make rich boiled custard of the milk, sugar and 
yolks, pour the caramel into it, strain into the 
freezer, and freeze as usual. Cut the figs small as 
raisins and mix them in- Put the frozen pudding 
into Neapolitan molds, and bed them in ice and 
salt for two hours.

321. Water Sponge Oake 

14 ounces of granulated sugar — 2 cups 

8 eggs. 

J pint of water— a large cup. 

18 ounces flour — 4 rounded cups. 

1 heaping teaspoonful baling powder. 

Separate the eggs, the whites into a good-sized 
bowl, the yolks into the mixing pan. 

Put the sugar and water with the yolks and beat 
up until they are light and thick. 

Mix the powder in the flour. 

Whip the whites to a very firm froth, and when 
they are ready stir the flour into the yolk mixture 
and mix in the whipped whites last. Bake either 
in small sponge cake molds— the little tin oblong- 
shaped pans joined a dozen together — or else 
spread in a large pan, and cut the cake in squares 
when it is cold. 



322. Strawberry Meringue. 

This is sold extensively at the fine bakeries un- 
der the name, generally, of strawberry shortcake. 
For the cake take the butter sponge cake, or 
8 ounces granulated sugar — 1 cup. 
5 eggs. 

4 ounces butter, melted — J cup, 
^ cup of milk. 
12 ounces of flour — 3 cups. 
1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 
Beat the sugar and eggs together a minute or two, 
add the melted butter, the milk, the powder and the 
flour. Bake on jelly-cake pans as thin as it can be 
spread, or, if preferred, on a large shallow baking 
pan. The cake is liable to rise in the middle and 
must be spread on the pan accordingly. 

When done cover the top of the cake with raw 
stiawbcrries and spread a thick covering of mer 
ingue on top of them. Set the cake in the oven one 
minute to bake a very light color on top, but the 
meringue paste must not be cooked through. 

The meringue paste or frosting is made by beat, 
ing 5 whites of eggs to a firm froth and then mixing 
in 4 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
Cut in squares to serve. 



323. Family Fruit Oake 

3 cupfuls of raisins — 1 pound. 

4 of currants — 1 pound. 
1 of sugar — 6 ounces, 

1 of butter — 6 ounces. 

1 molasses — 12 ounces 

2 eggs. 

1 cupful of sour milk. 
1 teaspoonful of soda. 
4 large cupfuls of flour — 18 ounces. 
Having prepared the fruit, make the butter soft 
mix it and the sugar, molasses, eggs and sour milk 



together in a pan, and beat well; mix the soda in 
the flour, put that in and beat again. Dust the 
fruit with flou., stir in, bake in a mold or shallow 
pan. 

Another cake of the same sort can be made by 
mixing fruit in the sponge ginger-bread. No. 220. 

324. Blackberry Meringue. 

Make the same as strawberry meringue at 
No. 322. 



325. Peach Meringue. 

Pare ripe peaches (not cooked), and out them to 
size of strawberries and make the same as straw- 
berry meringue at No. 322. 



326. Peach Shortcake. 

The same thing as strawberry shortcake, using 
chopped ripe peaches instead. It is a cake of short 
paste, not sweet, as large as a plate and thick as a 
biscuit, split in two after baking, peaches and sugar 
spread on the lower half, the other placed on top 
with the split side upward and more peaches 
spread upon that. It is eaten with cream. The 
ingredients required are: 

1 cupful of lard or butter — 8 ounces. 

3 cupfuls of flour — 12 ounces. 

^ teaspoonful salt. 

1 cup of ice water. 

1 quart of cut peaches. 

1 cupful of sugar. 
Pare the peaches, cut them small and shake up 
with the sugar before making the paste, and set them 
in a cool place. Bub the butter into the flour thor- 
oughly with the hands. Salt is needed only where 
lard is used. Make a hollow in the middle, pour in 
the wa'er, mix up soft, roll out on the table in flour 
reserved for the purpose. It makes the cake flaky 
and part in layers to roll it and fold it a few times 
like pie paste. 

Then make it up round,1et stand five minutes,roll 
out thick as biscuit and bake on a jelly-oake pan. 
Finish with fruit as above stated. 



327. Apple Shortcake. 

Use mellow apples of fine flavor and make the same 
as peach shortcake, the apples not to be cooked, but 
mixed with sugar and chopped and used immediately* 

Peach Cobbler. 

A peach pie made in a baking pan to be cut out 
in squares. Make common pie paste, roll out the 
larger half of it to a thin sheet and take up oflf the 
table by rolling it up on the rolling pin and so unrol^ 
it on the pan. Put in pared and cut peaches an 
inch deep, dredge a little sugar over them, oorer 
with the top crust and bake about half an hour.

THE HOTEL BOOK OF PUDDINGS. 



Considering with what reluctance the public are 
said to read prefaces, it seems quite fortunate that 
puddings are such familiar things and there is nex 
to nothing to be said about them; and, besides, thej 
constitute such a remarkably numerous family — race 
Burns called it — that if only they all have to speak 
for themselves there will be quite a time. And that 
reflection alone must give us pause, for among them 
are some such hoary patriarchs, venerable relics of 
antiquity, as would hardly brook any levity from us 
the creatures of yesterday. Suppose one should say 
to some of these old respectabilities, "You old rel- 
ics, you are heavy, you are indigestible; you are a 
black, unwholesome lump; you should be made over, 
shaken up, renovated like an old hotel; would they 
not rise up and annihiliate us with, 

'Pass, little mortal, pass, 
Thy days are but as grass.* 

But we were 

•Formed ages since, perhaps before the flood, 
We nurtured the stout dryads of the wood.' " 

Every one must have observed how natural it 
seems for artists to draw pudiings with faces, es- 
pecially Christmas plum puddings — depend upon it, 
there is something in it. If it would be such a 
heinous piece of presumption to attempt to change 
the nature of the old plum pudding, is it not almost 
as bad to change its form ? There is not much poe- 
try about puddings,but what little mite there is belongs 
to the old time round pudding boiled in a bag. The 
tall fellow in fine fluted moulds is an upstart. A 
writer in the Bazar — it may be three years since — 
traced back the plum pudding to its infancy, when 
it was only porridge — a sort of porridge with plums 
in it; but it grew out of that, and although occa- 
sionally through the accident of coming untied in the 
kettle it relapses temporarily into its early state, it is 
respectable and to memory dear only as a pudding 
round and solid. In the sanctum where these lines are 
written — one that is next neighbor to all out of 
doors, looking off "where wilds immeasureably 
spread seem lengthening as you go" — there is upon 
the wall a picture from Harper's Weekly of a Christ- 
mas at sea — "the pride of the ship's cook." He is 
carrying the plum pudding himself to the captain's 
cabin; none of the boys may touch that. The pict- 
ure is hung up a little askew in order to straighten 
up the cook. It makes but little difference which 
way one hangs a picture of a vessel on a rolling sea, 
but the cook looks a little reeling, and that pudding 
must be kept right side up at all hazards. Let no 
one entertain the least question about that pudding, 
it is the traditional sort, dark and solid and round, 
and the holly is sticking in the top; the glossy, 
•harp-spiked, red-berried English holly; brought 



from shore when the vessel started and carefully 
kept for the day. Who could dare lay innovating 
hands upon the composition of that ancient pud- 
ding ? Here it is. 

338. 

English Boiled Plum Puddingf. 

3 pounds of flour. 
2 pounds of chopped suet. 
2 pounds of seedless raisins. 
IJ pounds of currants. 

1 pound of citron. 

2 ounces of mixed ground spices — cinnamon, mace, 
nutmeg and cloves. 

Mix all the above dry articles together in a pan. 

Then mix the following fluids : 

1^ pints of milk. 

\ cup of black molasses, large measure. 

8 eggs. 

1 pound of common yellow sugar. 

^ pint of brandy. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Then stir both mixtures together. This should 
be prepared over night, and next morning tied up in 
four or five pudding cloths and boiled without inter- 
mission six hours. 

33» 

Some persons have hardly a speck of reverence 

for the antique, and had as lief add something to the 
time-honored English plum pudding as not, if they 
find it makes it lighter, more enjoyable and more 
digestible. Such people can add to the preceding 
receipts two pounds or less of fine white bread 
crumbs, and to the fluid part a half pint more milk. 
That is all, but it makes a difference. 

The quantity of pudding prescribed is enough for 
100 to 150 persons — that is to say, of persons having 
hotel dinners to eat besides. 



330. 

The addition of molasses to the preceding, and 

other puddings to come, is for the purpose of giving 
with the spices a dark color, but when refined 
syrups only can be had burnt sugar must be added 
for coloring. Not only cooks but many others like- 
wise ought to feel grateful to Count Albufage Cara- 
mel, of Nismes, who invented caramel. It is used 
forgiving a brown color to an immense number of 
eatable and drinkable articles, and is not only harm- 
less, but gives an agreeable flavor in some cases, as 
in creams. Put some sugar in a frying pan over the 
fire, let it burn darker than browned coffee, then fill 
up the pan with water, boil and strain. 



But there is another plum pudding, called in 
French bills-of f&re poudinff d V Allemande, which all 
who practice it will prefer to make nine times to the 
preceding kind once. It contains no flour, and can 
be boiled in half the time of Christmas pudding.

THE AMERICAN PASTBY OOOK. 



Boiled Plum Pudding. 



831. GERMAN PLUM PUDDING. 

2 pounds of white bread crumbs. 

1 pound of white sugar. 

1 pound of chopped suet. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 pound of currants. 

1 pint of milk. 

7 eggs. 

1 teaspoonful of mixed ground spices— -cinnamon, 
nutmeg and mace. 

^ cup of brandy. 

Salt, Pijich of soda. 

Mix the dry articles together — the bread crumbs 
being grated or chopped quite fine — then wet with the 
milk, eggs and brandy, the salt and soda dissolved 
in them; tie in four pudding cloths and boil four 
hours. 



Either of the plum puddings can be boiled or 
steamed in fancy moulds, to be sent to table 
whole. 

In deference to the temperance principles of some 
of their guests, the best hotels make it a rule to pre- 
pare two sauces for plum pudding, one being with- 
out spirit, the other the customary brandy sauce, set 
on fire just as the dish is sent in, or else the equally 
approved sauce sahayon. 

Another one of those revered patriarchs whom it 
were almost sacrilege to touch is Burn's, with "hon- 
est sonsie face," the haggis. In the English plum 
pudding, however, there is a grim, unmistakable 
identity that is very satisfying as compared with the 
shadowy indefiniteness of the Scottish chief. It is a 
pity that one of the last minstrels, if only one of 
humble rank, did not fix unchangeably in verse the 
component parts of the national haggis, as some one 
has done the "Eve's pudding," and Sydney Smith 
did for his salad, and another did for mulled wine. 
We have a compound called haggis, without the pre- 
ceding article, composed of meat, chopped ancho- 
vies, eggs, bread, sour wine, pepper and salt. But 
that does not seem to correspond with the remarks 
of an editor of Burns, who says the haggis was to 
Scotland what the plum pudding is to England, 
and it was the pride of her people that all the in- 
gredients and even the bag it was boiled in were of 
native production. 

It was either the Edinburgh Magazine or Cham- 
ber's Miscellany that published the following receipt, 
used on anniversary occasions in the best Edinburgh 
hotels and said to have been contributed by a Fife- 
shire landlady, who observed, however, that the rich 
made the haggis as good as they liked but the poor 
as good as they had means. We will not be too pre- 
Bumptious, but call this a haggis. The haggis may 



yet exist, "great chieftain of the pudding race," 
but in his makeup he will be found like a highland 
costume, not successfully transplantable. 



• 333. A Scotch Haggis. 

A kind of mince pudding, of the boiled plum 
pudding order, made with a large proportion of 
meat. 

A calf s heart and tongue — 2^ pounds. 

1 pound of chopped suet. 

1 pound of flour. 

1 pound of bread soaked in 

1 pint of milk. 

1 pound of chopped apples, or raisins. 

1 pound of white meat of chicken. 

6 eggs. Salt to season. 

^ pint of home-made currant wine. 

1 tablespoonful of mixed ground spices. 

Cook the heart and tongue half-done, then mince 
quite fine. Cut the breast of chicken in thin strips. 
Mix all the ingredients well together, the dry arti- 
cles first. Tie up in two pudding cloths and boil 4 
hours. 

Butter, sugar, and half cup of vinegar, all made 
hot and beaten together, for sauce. 

The great majority of all the best puddings made 
are of bread, either wholly or in part. The next is 
a good every day sort. 



333. Baked Bread Pudding. 



2 pounds of white bread slices. 

2 quarts of milk, or milk and water. 

4 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of white sugar. 

4 eggs. 

Nutmeg. 

The bread should be quite free from any dark 
crust. Spread the butter on the slices and then cut 
them in dice shapes. Mix milk, sugar and eggs to- 
gether and pour over the squares of bread in the 
baking pans. Bake till set in the middle. Any 
pudding sace will suit. 

"Hotel puddings," said a gentleman of good 
judgment and extensive experience of hotel and club 
life, for whom the writer was to prepare a litt'e 
complimentary dinner, "hotel puddings I never eat 
nor do I care to offer them to friends. They are al- 
ways too sweet — nothing but sweet — cloying — too 
sweet and rich at first, then further spoiled by a 
sauce all sugar. How can hotel cooks be so dull as 
not to see that they spoil their own work ? Now I 
had a woman cook in New York whose efforts in that 
line were a perfect contrast to what I had found at 
hotel tables If you know of any pudding that is not 
an hotel pudding, you may add it to the list." 



THE AMEBIOAN PASTRY COOK. 



79 



There are no puddings that are not hotel pud- 
dings. As in the case of English p'um puddings we 
follow old patterns too much, and overleap the mark 
trying to make the rich enough richer. 



334. Baked Bread Custard. 



MADEIRA WINE SAUCE. 



2 pressed in quarts of white bread crumbs. 

2 quarts of milk. 

4 ounces of butter melted. 

4 ounces of white sugar. 

1 lemon. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

Crumble the bread fine, either by grating or chop 
ping. Grate the rind of the lemon into it and 
squeeze the juice into the sugar. Beat the yolks of 
eggs and add them and the sugar to the milk, then 
the melted butter, and pour over the bread crumbs. 
Stir up well, turn it into two buttered milk pans and 
bake about half an hour. Buttering the pans allows 
of the brown outside being taken out clean instead of 
sticking to the pans and going to waste. In this 
cheap, simple and excellent pudding, as in many 
others, the whites of the eggs would do no good; the 
pudding is richer without them. They can be used 
for other purposes. 

335. 

The reader is advised to note the preceding re- 
ceipt for bread custard, as several acceptable varie- 
ties are made by certain additions, as 

BAKED CITRON PUDDING, CREAM SAUCE. 
RAISIN PUDDING, PT. WINE SAUc E. 
CURRANT PUDDING, LEMON SAUCE. 

Made by adding one pound of either of those or 
other suitable fruit to the preparation. The fruit 
must be strewn over the top after the puddings are 
in the pans; they sink to the bottom if stirred in. 
Pass a spoon over to press the fruit slightly under, 
otherwise it comes out in black blisters. There is 
as much in careful baking as skillful making. 



Another use of the same mixture is for 

336. Bread Puddingf Souffle. 

Or Bread Soufle. For this make the bread custard, 
but instead of baking stir ^the mixture in a sauce- 
pan over the fire till it thickens and becomes like 
paste. Take it ofi", and when cool enough not to 
cook them add 6 or 8 beaten yolks. Then beat all 
the whites that have been left over to stiflF froth, and 
stir them into the mixture. When this is baked it 
rises high above the top of the pan or mould. 

337. Puddingrs Souffles. 



It simplifies the making of puff puddings to re- 
member that nearly all sorts of puddings that are 
made with eggs, and many of the pie mixtures, such 



as cream pies and cheesecakes and lemon and pump, 
kin and corn starch custards, can be changed into 
souffles by a very simple process which is the same 
with all kinds in the main, only slight differences 
having to be made according to the various mixtures 
used. Pudding souses are of but little value for 
ordinary hotel dinners which run on for hours, be- 
cause they must be sent to table the minute they are 
done, while still puffed up, otherwise, when they 
have fallen, they are not so good as common pud- 
dings. But for dinners on the European plan, for 
parties, for dinners in courses and for individual 
service — anywhere that there can be a set time for 
serving the pudding these light trifles are much es- 
teemed. 

What is required to be done is to take the mix- 
ture already prepared for a baked pudding or cream 
pie and stir it over the fire till it assumes a pasty 
consistency, then add to it some beaten yolks of 
eggs raw; after that the whites whipped firm and 
perhaps a little brandy. Then bake the finished 
mixture either in large moulds or pudding shapes, 
if for a party dining together, with a band of but- 
tered paper pinned round to make the mould higher 
— to be removed before serving — or, in small cups, 
silver scallops or shells, to be served in individual 
style, or else in little paper cases made for the pur- 
pose. These little cases can be bought cheap, ready- 
made in the cities. They need to be buttered and 
baked slightly before using, to harden them. Cus- 
tard cups so used can be set in a pan of water while 
baking and need not be [made hot enough to spoil 
them; these little puddings bake in 15 or 20 min- 
utes. 

The mixtures so treated puff up either hollow or 
very spongy, and must be carried to table in that 
condition. Smooth mixtures like bread puddings 
and corn starch or rice flour compounds puff more 
than rough-grained sorts,|such as cocoanut creams or 
rice pudding. The pastry creams used for filling 
puffs, also lemon] honey, pine apple conserve and 
the like, that are already cooked need only to have 
from 4 to 6 "yolks added and then the whipped 
whites to make the richest possible souflBes. Flavor- 
ings and brandy or wine are to be added according 
to taste. 

With these general explanations covering the 
whole matter, only a few examples will be given here 
and there as we go along.

"Egg SouffleS' 



INDIVIDUAL PUFF PUDDINGS. 

First make the frangipane pastry cream : 1 quart 
of milk; 2 ounces of butter; 4 ounces of flour; 8 
ounces of sugarf 5 eggs. Mix sugar and flour dry; 
stir into the boiling milk; cook awhile, then add the 
eggs, and simmer 20 minutes.

When this is partly cooled beat the yolks of 6 eggs 
and stir them in a little at a time; flavor with lem- 
on, vanilla or cinnamon extract. Then whip the 
whites of 8 eggs quite firm and stir them in lightly. 
Bake either in cups or paper cases, 10 to 15 min- 
utes, in a brisk oven. Sift on the top of each some 
powdered sugar flavored with vanilla powder or 
lemon zest. No sauce required. The chocolate pas- 
try cream, and others to be found in "Cream Fill- 
ings" can be used in precisely the same way. 

339. 

Baked Brown Bread Puddinar. 



POUDING A LA GOTHA. 



2 full pressed quarts of graham bread crumbs. 

2 quarts of water or milk (8 cups). 

4 ounces of molasses (2 cooking spoons). 

4 ouiices of butter. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. 

Have the bread finely crumbled; melt the butter 
and mix it with the milk, eggs and molasses; stir all 
together and bake half an hour. 

The natural lightness of the bread counts for qual- 
ity in all these puddings, and it should not be de- 
stroyed by either scalding or heating. 

Serve the preceding with honey and butter di- 
luted and made hot, or else with any good pudding 



Souffle puddings, it has been remarked, are not 
adapted for hotel dinners long drawn out, but they 
are very handsomely replaced by meringues, which, 
— but stay; the Boston publisher's pudding must 
not be forgotten. Blessed is the hotel guest whom 
the waiters delight to honor. The publisher was one 
of these — sojourning in a beautiful winter city — but 
whether it was a real Spartan like abstemiousness of 
habit or whether there could be nothing good out- 
side of Boston, all their efforts were thrown away 
until 

**Ha 1 now you are bringing me something I 
like." 



340. Boston Bread Puddingr, 



WITH BRANDY SAUCE. 



2 pounds of bread in slices. 

^ pound of butter — best fresh. 

2 quarts of milk. 

^ pound of sugar. 

4 whole eggs and 4 yolks. 

1 pound of clean picked currants. 

^ a nutmeg, grated. 

Have the slices free from dark crust. Spread 
them with the butter and place in two layers in two 
pudding pans, with the currants sprinkled between 



and on top. Beat and mix the eggs, sugar, milk 
and nutmeg together, pour over the bread, cover the 
puddings with either buttered paper orbread crusts, 
and bake about half an hour. To be good, this pud- 
ding must have plenty of custard in proportion to 
the bread, and be baked late and served hot. 

Lemon transparent sauce answers as well as 
brandy. 

"They say" that we in hotels run too much to baked 
puddings and not enough to boiled-and steamed. It 
need not be so. They, the complainants, are prob- 
ably English, Germans and Scotch, who all are ac- 
customed to puddings boiled rather than baked. 
The last boiled pudding we had was Scottish. Where 
else in old Scotland did we see a nice person making 
a boiled pudding, a favorite cosmopolitan sort not 
National in character ? Of course it was not Meg 
Merrilies stirring the witch-pot which so terrified 
Dominie Sampson, hun gry as he was; nor Flora Mao 
Ivor; nor Die Vernon; nor George Sands' s French im- 
itation of her, yet it was some one with a family resem- 
blance to them, only there was the dash of sea waves 
somewhere about. Mirando keeping house for Pros- 
pero in the island cavern in the Tempest ? No. Two 
young people cooking wild ducks on an island in 
Foul Play ? No; milder; further north, among 
cliffs and wild fowl. Noma, of the Fitful Head ? 
No; but near by in Scottish waters. It was Madcap 
"Violet on board a yacht making an apricot jam 
pudding, a real roly-poly pudding for the captain, 
and all hands if there were any besides Apricot 
jam pudding is real good. Green apple rolls are 
rather more popular on this side. Does Mr. William 
Black really wish it to be understood that over there 
the wealthy railroad builders' daughters all know 
how to make puddings ? This one, it seems, made 
her jam pudding with a heart ache; a very poor 
mixture; too heavy; baking powder is incomparably 
bet'er, as you shall see. 

Boiled fruit rolls have the great recommendation 
of not requiring either milk or eggs in their compo- 
sition. Nowhere are eggs so lavishly used as in our 
American hotel kitchens. They are usually cheap 
enough, and if not it is best that articles requiring 
eggs should have enough to make them what they 
ought to be, but the need is, for times of scarcity, to 
cultivate a knowledge of articles of a plainer sort. 
These roll puddings and other plain combinations of 
flour and fruit are used everywhere in England. 
The Frenchman serves them at the best tables as 
le pouding roule, or &s pouding a I' Allemande, or, d 

r Anglaise, 
when made with preserves or jam. 

Not many can, and perhaps not many try, to make 
the paste for boiled rolls as good as it is capable of 
being; but when good it can safely be said that none 
of our richest puddings are more in request than 
these foP owing.

Boiled Roll Paste. 



It is required to be as light and dry-looking when 
boiled, as bread or biscuit, and to peel apart in 
flakes It is made in the same general manner as 
puff paste, but to secure the flakiness must be rolled 
only 4 times. No shortening nor powder to be rubbed 
in, but all to be rolled in layers. The softer the 
dough can be, to roll well, the better will be the 
pudding. 

2 pounds of flour. 

1 pint of water — full measure, 

1 teaspoonful of.salt. 

f pound of firm, cold, sweet lard. 

4 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Butter can be used instead of lard, and the salt 
omitted. 

Lay aside a large handful of the flour to dust with. 
Pour the cold water in the middle of the rest of the 
flour and mix carefully to have it smooth. Turn 
the dough on the floured table, work it very little, 
spread it out by rolling; drop the lard in lumps an 
inch apart all over, sprinkle the salt on that, sift a 
little flour over, fold it in three, and count that one 
turn. Roll it out again, spread two teaspoons of 
powder over it dry like so much flour, fold over and 
count two. At the next rolling spread on the rest 
of the powder, and one more rolling and folding, 
making four times, finishes it. Common short paste 
and biscuit dough can also be used for roll pud- 
dings; also biscuit dough improved by having short- 
ening rolled in. 



343. Boiled Green Apple Roll. 

Pare and slice enough good cooking apples to 
make two quarts when minced. Chop them in a 
bowl and use without cooking, to spread over the 

paste. 

Cut the paste already made into 4 pieces, roll out 
thin, spread the chopped apples evenly, roll up and 
tie in pudding cloths previously wetted and floured. 
Stick a pin in the middle to prevent swelling open; 
drop into plenty of boiling water and keep boiling 
without check from an hour to an hour and a half. 
Serve with butter and sugar hard sauce. 

These rolls can be steamed as well. The writer 
thinks they are better boiled. Dip each one a mo- 
ment in cold water when taking up, they come out 
of the cloth easier for it. 



343. Butter and Sugar Sauce. 



HARD SAUCE. 



1 pound of powdered sugar. 

J pound of best butter. 

Nutmeg. 

Warm the butter and sugar sufficiently to mix 
well. Beat them together till perfectly white. 
Grate nutmeg over the smooih top. A favorite kind 
of sauce for any plain pudding. 



344. Boiled Cranberry Roll. 

2 quarts of cranbei'ries. 

1 pound of white sugar. 

^ pint of water. 

Wash and pick over the cranberries, place I hem 
in a bright kettle, strew the sugar over the top and 
pour the water over that. Put on a tight lid to keep 
in the steam, let them come to a boil slowly. Cook 
about half an hour. Mash through a colander and 
use the pulp for the boiled rolls. Itought to be cold 
before being used. 

All of these puddings are calculated for about fif- 
ty people's orders. 

Hotel cooks dishing up dinner like to sell out their 
wares, whether fish, entrees, pastries or creams, as 
well as people in market. The market varies a lit 
tie in its demands, but in a general way the roly- 
poly puddings finding the readiest sale are the two 
kinds proceeding; after them come 
CURRANT JELLY ROLL. 
APRICOT JAM ROLL. 
PEACH ROLL. 
HUCKLEBERRY ROLL, 
and then one made with molasses mixed with flour 
and vinegar. 



It takes baking-powder to make the preceding ar- 
ticles, but the less shortening. Light and whole- 
some preparations are taking the places of the too 
solid puddings of a little while back. But baking, 
powder cannot be had everywhere, and the cook is 
most independent of circumstances who is richest 
in resources. Other kinds of paste will do well, as 
will be shown further on. At present we are in 
haste to get up some puddings for Sundays. Before 
getting too far away from them, however, it is nec- 
essary to remark that none of the plum puddings 
intended for boiling are of much account when 
baked, but the following, if carefully baked, will be 
found very satisfactory. 

To crumble bread when it cannot be grated, first 
slice it very thin, then cut in shreds and across in 
small squares. It is the only neat way. Puddings 
with white rough pieces of bread in the middle do 
not look well. 



346. Baked Fruit Pudding. 



1 pound of bread crumbs. 

^ pound of chopped suet. 

^ pound of raisins. 

^ pound of currants. 

^ pound of sugar. 

1 pint of milk or water. 

3 eggs. Salt. 

1 teaspoonful of mixed ground spices. 

1 level teaspoonful of soda 

Crumble the bread small; mix all the dry articles

with it except soda, which dissolve in the milk. 
Beat the eggs in the milk and stir up the pudding 
with it, add the brandy last. Bake one hour in 
buttered pans. Cover with paper to keep the fruit 
from blistering. 

What the following pudding has done that it 
should be called the "queen of puddings" no one 
knows, but that is one name it is known by on both 
sides of the Atlantic. Cooks demur at the appella- 
tion, because there is always as good a pudding in 
their lepository as ever was brought out, and each 
one is the queen for the day. However this is a 
pretty pudding. 



347. Nonpareil Pudding. 



JELLY PUDDING, MERINGUE PUDDING, QUEEN 
OF PUDDINGS, ETC. 

1 pressed in quart of white bread crumbs. 

1 quart of milk. 

^ pound of butter melted. 

J pound of sugar. 

1 lemon. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

1 cup of fruit jelly. 

5 whites and 4 ounces of sugar for the merin 
gue. 

The jelly is to spread on top after the pudding 
are baked. 

Mix all the ingredients preceding it together cold 
— the lemon grated and squeezed. Bake till set in 
the middle. Take out and spread the jelly over the 
top. Beat the whites of eggs till they will not fall 
out of the bowl turned upside down; stir in the su- 
gar — granulated is best — and a few drops of flavor- 
ing. Set the puddings back in the oven till the jelly 
on top is at boiling he it, then spread the meringue 
over and let them stay with the oven doors wide 
open to dry.bake and acquire a slight color. 



It seems impossible to get along very fast, for now 
there has to be a little talk about meringues. Me- 
ringue (marang) paste is the mixture of beaten white 
of egg and sugar. When we write lemon pie me- 
ringuS, it means that it is meringued. Meringues 
ake a wide scope. The icing and ornamenting on 
cakes is strictly meringue paste. Egg kisses, as they 
are called, are meringues. The diflferences are only 
in the proportion of sugar to eggs. Let us call this 
on puddings and lemon pies soft meringue to distin- 
guish it from frosting. A tray full of saucers of 
pudding of the preceding sort looks very attractive 
when success has attended the making. The pud- 
ding should be shallow in the pan, and the meringue 
should be of about equal thickness; should be firm 
and cut square, only very often it does not do so, 
but falls after baking till it is nothing but a pitiful 



scum. Too much baking is generally the reason. 
Meringue needs only a very slight heat. Another 
thing that spoils meringue is spreading it on cold 
jelly or fruit. It never cooks at bottom but dis- 
solves to syrup. Have the puddingg or pies baking 
hot when the meringue touches them and it will not 
disappoint you. As to getting the whites to beat up 
light with ease and certainty that can be accom- 
plished by having them cold to begin with, in a cold 
bowl and beaten in a cool place. Fifteen minutes of 
hard work may be avoided by taking this precau- 
tion, and five minutes' beating will do as well. 



The next is a fine pudding to make when you 
have used the last pint of milk obtainable for ice 
cream; for this needs to be made with water, to be 
semi-transparent. 



Lemon Meringue Pudding, with Sweet 
348. Cream. 



1 full pressed quart of bread crumbs. 

1 quart of water. 

6 ounces of finely chopped suet. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

3 lemons — rinds of all, juice of 2. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

^ teaspoonful of soda. 

Grate the rinds of the lemons into the bread 
crumbs — using a tin grater and scraping the zest 
from that with a lump of sugar — also mix in the 
suet. Squeeze the lemon juice into the water, pour 
it over the bread, add the sugar, eggs beaten, and 
lastly the soda in a little water. Bake and finish 
by spreading meringue over the top — made of the 
whites left over — same as directed for nonpareil 
pudding preceding. No jelly needed. For an 
acid pudding like this an extra sweetness and fine 
appearance may be given by sifting granulated sugar 
on top of the meringue at the moment before putting 
it in the oven — makes a glazed crust. The lemon 
pudding, of course, can be left plain, without merin- 
gue. Sweetened cream made hot, but not boiled, is 
the best sauce. 



349. Lemon Pudding Souffle. 



INDIVIDUAL LEMON PUDDINGS. 



Make the mixture for the lemon pudding of the 
preceding receipt. Instead of baking stir it over the 
fire in a bright saucepan till it becomes thick and 
pasty. Beat 4 or 6 more yolks quite light and stir 
them in; then beat all the whites left over to a stiff 
froth and mix them in likewise. Bake in cups or 
paper cases. If wished ;o ornament these small 
puddings make some meringue and drop a table- 
spoonful on top while baking, when done fawn col- 
or drop some spots of bright red currant jelly on top 
of that. Send straight from the oven to the table, 
as they soon fall. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK.

Already there are two or tbree ways indicated of 
"topping oflF" with meringue— plain; with a crust- 
ing of sugar on top; and with spots of red jelly on 
the white; ways that are equally applicable to flor- 
entines, fruit compotes and other dishes. The next 
specimen gives another variation. 

350. Baked Oocoanut Pudding. 
WITH ORANGE SYRUP. 



1 pound of cocoanut (less if the desiccated is 
used). 

1 full pressed quart of bread crumbs. 

1 quart of milk. 

2 ounces of butter. 
2 ounces of sugar. 

1 lemon, or sour orange. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

Make up like preceding kinds; mix in half the 
cocoanut and bake in two buttered pans. Beat up 6 
whites of eggs, add to the firm froth 5 ounces of 
granulated sugar and the remaining half pound of 
cocoanut. Spread this cocoanut meringue over the 
puddings and bake again very slowly with the oven 
doors open. Cut in squares or diamond shapes and 
serve with orange syrup. 
351. 

There are numbers of good nondescript articles 
which we hardly know where to place on an Ameri- 
can hotel bill-of fare. 

Their merit is proven by that best of tests, a con- 
stant appreciative demand. A good dinner gets to 
looking incomplete when occasionally they are left 
oflf. As these articles do not belong anywhere else 
they are by common consent and usage called "sweet 
entrees'' — which is probably an Americanism— and 
with the entrees they stand, usually bringing up the 
rear. 

As already hinted, these "sweet entrees" are al- 
ways evidently welcome and undoubtedly make a 
difference in the amount of pastry required after- 
wards. But one of these is enough at a time. Bad 
taste, poor management and poverty of resource 
among meats and vegetables are apparent when a 
bill-of-fare with ten or twelve entrees shows half of 
them to be of a sweet or farinaceous character. 
Without the one each day a long line of favorites, 
such as fruit fritters, charlottes, rice cakes, sweet 
croquettes, patties, turnovers, rice with apples, pan- 
cakes, etc., etc., cou'd never appear at all. 

This, however, applies only to hotels furnishing 
full length bills-of-fare. There are greater numbers 
of houses, both public and private, where any one of 
these sweet entrees might suffice for the pastry 
course, and this is particularly the reason for here 
describing the charlottes which are oftenest used as 
puddings 



and its cheapness, make it worth the attention here 
given to details. 



353. 



Apple Charlotte. 



A LA PARISIENNE. 



A fruit charlotte cannot be "thrown together" 
and be good. Its excellence, when carefully made, 



Compote of apples, or apples stewed dry and 
sweet, baked between two layers of buttered bread 
and glazed with egg and sugar. 
40 small thin slices of French roHs. 

2 pounds of pared and quartered apples 

1 pound of sugar. 

f pound of butter. 

1 or 2 eggs for glaze. 

Nutmeg or cinnamon. 

Stew the apples soft with three-fourths of the su- 
gar and a pint of water and steam shut in; then 
mash with a spoon and grate nutmeg in. 

Dip the slices of rolls as lightly as possible in the 
butter melted in a deep pan — dip both sides without 
touchingthe salt dregs. Line two bright, three- 
quart pans with them, bottom and sides, divide the 
apple in, placing it well around the sides; lay more 
dipped slices all over the tops slightly pressed into 
the fruit, and bake the charlottes of a nice toast 
color, bottom crusts as well as top. Then with a 
brush wet them over with egg and water; dredge 
the remaining sugar over and bake ten minutes more 
to glaze. 

To be dished out of the pans; no sauce needed 
unless for pudding, when sweet cream is best. 



For a charlotte to be served whole still greater care 
is needed in baking. Take a deep mould, a six or 
eight sided cake or pudding mould does. Cut slices 
of bread to fit— bottom, top and sides. Spread but- 
ter rather thickly on one side the slices, dip the 
other side in beaten egg; place them with the butter 
next the tin, fill the inside with the apple compote; 
place the cover of bread on top and bake in a mod- 
erate oven over half an hour. Turn it out carefully 
on to the dish, glaze over with egg and sugar and 
the red-hot salamander and pour round it either 
diluted red jelly or else whipped cream. 

354. Buttered Apples on Toast- 



AMERICAN APPLE CHARLOTTE. 



This can only be made "just right" when extra 
good, easy-bakin^ apples are at hand, because the 
raw apples should be done by the time the bread 
at bottom is browned. Pippins and bellflowers are 
best. 
40 thin, square slices of bread. 

2 pounds of pared apples. 

f pound of butter. 

f pound of sugar. 

Cinnamon or nutmeg. 

The slices of bread should be all of one size. Dip

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



one fide ia melted butter and place them, buttered 
side do?rn, ia close order in a shallow baking-pan; 
place lialf an apple or two quarters on each slice and 
bake brown with repeated bastings with a syrup 
made cf the sugar, butter and cup of hot water and 
cinnamon. The apples ought to shine transparently 
without black edges when done. Dish up with an 
egg-slice. 



355. Charlotte a la Marialva. 



Named, probably, after a French cathedral town; 
possib'y a monastery. It is a charlotte of the most 
elaborate degree, the bread cut in small fancy 
shapes and placed in patterns, or in fingers lapping 
edges, on the sides of a mould spread with butter. 
Apples and apricots, sugar and butter and fruit 
jelly all stewed down to a paste is used to fi 1. 
Baked, glazed, and wine sauce served with it. 



The preceding directions and examples apply to 

PEACH CHARLOTTES. 
PEAR CHARLOTTES. 
CHARLOTTES OF MIXED FRUITS. 

Almost any kind can be used. The poorest that can 
be used for such a purpose are the mulberries dyed 
with logwood, which are now being sold for canned 
blackberries. Mulberries with their own natural 
color, when mixed with sour apples, are good 
enough. 



Now here, in the next, is another knot to be un- 
tied. Not that the charlotte itself is a knot, else it 
were better cut than picked apieces, but the name, 
"friar's omelet," whence comes it ? The clue in this 
case is fainter than the almost invisible thread which 
led through the maze to Fair Rosamond's bower. 
Why should a charlotte, or rather, perhaps a mix- 
ture of apples be called an omelet, unless, because, 
it looked like omelet ? And suppose the preceding 
charlotte a la Marialva came from a monastery and 
the English cooks made an ap;le mixture as near 
like it as they could and called it friar's omelet. 
And suppose the French cooks adopted the English 
mixture because it was good and called it English 
apple cake. That is how it seems to have been. 
There used to be a saying about the longest way 
round being the shortest way home, and another 
about going from home to learn the news. Some 
English names being placed backwards in French 
have come back to our language as new words, as 
canteen from tin can; so in French cook books we 
find that called English apple cake, which in Eng- 
lish on both siJes of the Atlantic is called friar's 
omelet. 

Suppose once more that some person out of pa- 
tience with trying to line his charlotte mould with 
bread patterns of leaves, flowers, crosses and hearts 
and diamonds, just crumble the bread fine and 



pressed a blanket like coat of crumbs on to the thick 
buttered slides of the mould, filled that wilh the fol- 
lowing mixture and ba'^ed it of a handsome reddish 
brown, why then you have a very fair conception of 
the way that many of our good but rough-aud ready 
American dishes came to be made. 



356. English Sweet Apple Cake 

FRIAR'S OMELET. GATEAU DE POMMES REN- 
VERS"E. 

A kind of tirabale of apple custard baked with a 
casing of bread crumbs. 

1 quart of dry stewed apples, or baked apple 
pulp. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

4 ounces of butter. 

^ cupful of cream. 

6 eggs. 

Nutmeg and cinnamon. 

Bread crumbs, about a quart. 

Custard for sauce. 

Mash the drained apples through a colander, 
add the butter to it while warm, then the sugar and 
flavor, and the eggs and creim beaten together. 
Ppread some softened butter all over the inside of a 
mould or pudding pan and press on all the fine 
grated bread crumbs that can be made to stick. 
Pour in the apple mixture; cover the top with 
crumbs pressed in; moisten the top with melted but- 
ter and bake brown, and well set. 

Turn the apple cake carefully upside down out of 
the mould and serve it either with whipped cream 
flavored with wiue and sugar, {d la chantilly) or 
with diluted red fruit jelly [sauce auxfruiti). 



357. 



Individual Charlottes. 



Are best and easiest made with either the friar*s 
omelet mixture preceding, or the apple custard pud- 
ding following; use the deepest gem pans; if fluted 
or otherwise ornamented shapes, so much the better. 
Brush them over with a brush dipped in soft butter, 
coat with bread crumbs, fill and bake like the large 
apple cake. ^\hea done have somt sauce dorSe 
ready; mix into it a nearly equal amount of thick 
cream whipped to froth, and pour this around the 
charlottes Another way is to place a spoonfal of 
meringue on each one and set the charlottes back in 
the oven on a baking pan to color. Place two or 
three red raspberries on top of the meringue. No 
sauce required.

the mixture over the fire till it becomes thick. Take 
it oflF and add 4 beaten jolks, ^ cup of brandy, a 
teaspoonful of lemon extract and the same of ex- 
tract of cloves; then 6 whites of eggs beaten up firm. 
Bake in cups, shells or paper cases. If the apple 
justard be used — it is the richer of the two — observe 
that it is of double quantity and the added ingredi- 
ents must be doubled accordingly. 

350. Apple Custard Pudding. 
A L'AMERICAINE. 



2 quarts of dry stewed apples or baked apple 
pulp. 

1 pound of sugar. 

^ pound of butter. 
20 yolks of eggs. 

Lemon, nutmeg, or cinnamon flavor. 

Mash the drained apples through a strainer. Mix 
in the other ingredients. Bake in a bright pan pre- 
viously buttered. Use as pudding with either 
sweetened cream or wine sauce. 



Here we have reached a boundary line. One step 
more would be out of the domains of pudding and 
over the borders of pie, for the last apple custard 
with a little milk added makes nice apple cream 
pie. 

'•Well, thankgoodness, it was not a bread pud- 
ding, for we are so tired of bread puddings." 

"When did we have any bread puddings ? We 
have had queen of puddings, plum puddings, baked 
fruit pudding, lemon pudding, cocoanut pudding, 
charlottes, and souffles and meringues." 

«'They all have bread in them, more or less, ex- 
cept the boiled roll puddings, and they are made of 
biscuit dough." 

"But they all and many more were made with 
bread, more or less, before our time; and they are 
none of the rough, unsightly bread crust abom- 
inations, but delicate compounds of fine, white 
crumbs." 

"There is no fault to be found with the puddings, 
but don't you see there's no more bread in the 
house ?" 

"Oh, well there are many good substitutes when 
bread cannot be obtained, but you will manage to 
admit just one more that is made with bread, more or 
less, both because it is a boiled pudding for a change, 
and has already once been called by name but never 
appeared. It is one of the best."

Eve's Puddingf. 



A favorite variety of the plum pudding order, 
light and not too rich. Also called pouding d la 
Francaise. The pundit who put the receipt in 
verse was not concerned about the needs of large 
hotels. 



1 pound of bread crumbs cut fine. 

h pound of chopped suet. 

I pound of seedless raisins, or currants. 

f pound of chopped apples. 

J a nutmeg grated. 

Mix the above together dry; then beat together : 

9 eggs Salt. 

J pound of sugar. 

1 teaspoonful of lemon extract. 

Stir all well together; tie the mixture in two cloths, 
leaving a little room to swell, and boil without stop- 
page 4 hours. When eggs are scarce 5 or 6 will do 
with half a cup of milk added. Butter and sugar 
sauce is suitable; though one says, '-Adam won't 
like it without wine and sugar." 



"Such," says Bulwer, 'is the constant habit of 
young people. They think anything expensive is 
necessarily good." Bulwer was young himself at 
that time, and must have known how it was. If the 
obverse was as invariably the case we should expect 
to find but few admirers of the following, which is 
the cheapest pudding made. Certainly ii is not the 
case in this direction, for we find no difficulty in 
disposing of large quantities of this pudding of many 
names. However, it must be properly baked, and 
ought to be in a brick oven, otherwise it has no 
goodness at all. The theory of rice pudding is — 
by the way, perhaps you did not know there was a 
theory of rice pudding ? Yes, indeed. This is a 
great day for theories, and there is a pudding theory 
as well as a nebular theory and an atomic theory ' 
and an evolution theory; and as there will be unlim- 
ited time to study the others after we are done with 
pudding it is evident the pudding theory should 
stand first. — The rice pudding theory teaches that 
all the richness is derived from the evaporation and 
condensation of the milk. As one pint of rice will 
absorb three pints of milk and no more, the baking 
has to be so protracted that the pudding is made to 
contain the condensed richness of six pints of milk, 
half of it, the watery part being dried out in the 
oven. As a matter of course the richer the milk and 
the more cream it contains the better it will be to 
start with. '

1 pint of rice. 

1 pint of white sugar. 
6 pints of milk. 

Ground cinnamon or nutmeg. 
Very little salt. 

2 ounces of butter, optional. 

Wash the rice in three or four waters and divide 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



it in two pudding pans. Mix the sugar, salt and 
cinnamon equally with it, then pour in the milk 
cold. Add the butter if the milk is not rich. Bake 
in a slow oven 3 or 4 hours. It may be best to use 
only 5 pints of milk at first, and add the other if 
the time allows the puddings to boil down dry 
enough. Scorching on top may be prevented by 
covering with paper previously greased. Almost 
any pudding sauce is suitable, and so is pure cream, 
but for preference, sauce dorSe or golden sauce may 
be taken; it gives the best appearance to so plain a 
pudding. 

People who are weary of the sameness of egg- 
laden and butter-soaked hotel puddings, and who 
like simple flavors, will appreciate the foregoing 
plain rice pudding and the following wholesome 
variations of the same. 



SS2, Bioe and Apple Pudding. 



The plain rice pudding preceding, made with only 
4 pints of milk and 1 pound of good cooking apples, 
pared, cored and quartered. 

Drop the quartered apples in the puddings, bake 
3 or 4 hours and keep covered with buttered paper 
to prevent scorching, and black edges on the apples. 
An inch length of stick cinnamon to each pud- 
ding improves. Cream and sugar, or else hard 
sauce. 
363. 



Baked Bice and Raisin Puddingf. 



Same as the last with raisins instead of apples. 
None of the foregoing rice puddings should ever be 
stirred while baking. The rice grains should be 
whole when done. 



The next needs no help of sauce for its appear- 
ance. It is as rich and delicate as a rice pudding 
pure and simple can be made. 



So, sonny, you say you have a mother to help, and 
you have beea trying everywhere and you can't get 
anything else whatever to do, therefore you want to 
get aj^b in the kitchen. Now, don't you see that 
is not at all complimentry to the kitchen ? Hotel 
keepers have a hard enough time without having to 
contend with the leavings and castaways of all other 
occupations and employments. Yet they always 
want smart, intelligent and industrious boys. You 
appear to have sense, perhaps you even have sense 
enough to become a good cook. And you might do 
worse. You will probably live to see the time when 
a man of sense and sensibility will not be ashamed 
in the United States to say he is a hotel cook. And 
we all want helpers of the right sort. Our good 
seconds, whose ways and dispositions we know, and 
who know ours, are continually drifting away from 
us. They are always wanted to go to the head of 



some other kitchen. They take partnerships in res 
taurants. They open ice cream saloons, bakeries, 
railway eating houses, saloons, lunch stands; they 
go as stewards; and some are lost and never are 
found. So there is room for intelligent boys like 
you — if you are intelligent. ?he keeps you clean 
and decent, doesn't she ? Can you read and write ? 
Yes. Have you worked in a kitchen before — know 
a stock boiler from a chopping machine ? Yes, you 
have worked about a kitchen a little. Good enough ; 
now go and make me this rice pudding. You can't 
make a rice pudding ? Oh, yes you can; the finest 
rice pudding you ever saw; just as good as I can. 
Take this receipt; hang it on the nail before you; 
follow it out; you will come out right. But observe 
there is not a word too much, and every word means 
something. When it says buttered pans it means 
you are to butter the pans before you pour the pud- 
dings in. When it says well washed rice it means 
you are to sure enough wash the rice — rub it clean 
in cold water, pick out the specks; pour water on 
and oflF it till there is no more sign of meal in it It 
is the meal or flour in rice that burns at the bottom 
of the saucepan, not the rice alone. When you have 
made this successfully preserve the receipt. You 
will not be a cook or pastry cook because that one 
thing is done perfectly; it will take you five years to 
learn it a:I, and then there will be just as much more 
that you will never learn. But if you do some new 
thing each day and hold on to the knowledge, and 
observe all that is done around you you will have 
gained so much over and above your wages. Count 
it in dollars if you like; one dollar, five dollars; ac- 
cording to the desirableness of the article you have 
learned to produce; according to the difficulty of 
making it which you will have overcome. So in a jear 
or two you will have a trade better for you than if 
your daddy had left you a fortune. Now scoot. 
Don't speak to me anymore till I speak to you. The 
other boys will show you where to find the rice, 
milk, sugar, butter, eggs. You will be slow at first. 
We don't allow youngsters to do guess work. Old 
hands may guess, but even they can't always hit it, 
and your ingredients cost money. Afterwards you 
must learn to work fast if you are going to be a ho- 
tel cook. I shall know by to-night exactly what you 
are worth. "For man is man and master of his 
fate." How goes that song ? I will make that boy 
learn it if it can ever be found again. 

"Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and let it turn. 
Thy wheel and thee we neitherfear nor hate. 

Our lands are little but our hearts are great, 
And man is man and master of his fate," 

Or words to that efifect.

864. Rice Oustard Pudding. 



VANILLA SAUCE. 

2 full quarts of well cooked dry ric«. 

6 ounces of butter. 

8 ouuces of sugar. 

8 jolks of eggs. 

1 quart of milk. 

1 tab'espoonful of lemon extract 

The rice should be already cooked in water and 
milk. Measure it and while still hot stir in the 
butter and sugar. Beat the yolks with the mi'k 
gradually added; stir well into the rice; flavor 
slightly; pour the pudding into two buttered pans 
and bake about half an hour. 

To prepare the rice from the first boil 1 pound of 
well- washed rice in 1 quart of water, add a pinch 
of salt. When half done add 1 pint of milk and let 
simmer an hour with the steam shut in. Never stir 
it and it will not be very apt to burn. 

Any of these puddings lett over can be used for 
fritters. 

Full directions for making a score or more of good 
pudding sauces will be found all together, further 
on. For these richest rice compounds a clear 
traosparent sauce flavored with vanilla, or else with 
red wine, will be found most suitable. 



As with the bread custard and the plain rice the 
reader is advised to note particularly the preceding 
rice custard, not only to avoid repetition here, 
which would be a small matter, but because the 
mystery is all removed from the variations when 
the basis of all has once been made. 



Carolina Pudding, with Transparent 
305. Sauce. 



Make the rice custard pudding preceding, and add 
to it one egg more, and ^ pound each of seedless or 
seeded raisins, currants and candied orange peel. 
Flavor with orange extract very lightly. The fruit 
must be strewn evenly over the top after the pud- 
ding is in the baking pans, and slightly pressed in 
with a spoon; else it may all sink to the bottom. 



West Indian Pudding, 
360. Jelly. 



with Guava 



Make the rice custard pudding, preceding, and 
add to it 1 whole egg and ^ pound of grated fresh 
cocoanut. Mix all, and when the pudding is in the 
pans take 1 pounl of pineapple in thin, small slices 
and lay over the top, slightly pressing it in. 

The pineapple, if fresh, should be stewed first in 
a little sugar syrup; then use the syrup to dilute the 
guava jelly for sauce. 

Bake these puddings no longer than till fairly set 



in the midd'e, as the fruit has a tendency to cause 
a watery separation of tho eggs if cooked too 
long. Curacoa diluted a little and made hot is also 
a good sauce. 

For the same reason that apple charlottes were in- 
cluded, the following *'sweet entrees' are hera 
placed in succession; namely, because they are used 
as puddings on occasion. 

30T. 

Rice Cake; with Ourrant Jelly. 

2 quarts of well cooked dry rice. 

6 ounces of butter. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

^ pint of milk (or less, or none if the rice be not 
dry.) 

Flavor with nutmeg or vanilla. 

Mix all the ingredients together, mashing the rice 
with the spoon. Smooth it over, about an inch 
deep, in a buttered pan. Bake in a hot oven to get 
a quiclj brown on top. Cut out diamonds, squares, 
or other ceat shapes, and serve with red currant 
jelly placed tastefully on or about the rice cake. 



Articles like the above ought always be baked in 
bright tin pans. Iron meat pans, however clean, 
generally stain the under side and make the cakes 
uneatable. 



308. Rice Cake, with Fruits. 



Prepare the rice cake of the foregoing receipt; al- 
so any kind of rich, thick, stewed down fruit, or 
compote of lemons or oranges. 

Spread the bottoms of two bright pudding pans 
with butter and press on a coating of bread crumbs; 
all that will stick. Cover this with the rice cake 
mixture by spoonfuls, not displacing the crumbs. 
Spread a thin layer of the compote over that, then 
rice cake, then compote again, and finish with rice 
on top. Moisten and smooth over with a little 
cream. Sift on a little fine bread crumbs from a 
colander. Bake half an hour. The layers should 
be no thicker than those of ordinary jelly cake. 
Turn the cake out when done. Serve neat squares 
or diamonds with the brown bottom side up and the 
compote syrup, or any sauce around.

We would never trouble about timbales in a book 

of puddings if the word was not a stumbling block 
in the way. There are timbales of rice and sweet 
timbales of macaroni, etc., which in effect are orna- 
mental puddings. The word often appears in bills- 
of-fare when it means only rice cakes like the pre- 
ceding kinds. Timbale means kettle drum, and is 
in allusion to the shape of a pudding in an orna- 
mental pastry case. Suppose you take some ye^ow 
nouilles paste and by means of a mould form a shape

THE AMERICAN PASTHY COOK, 



like the castle in chess, anil fill that with rice cake 
and bake it. That is the simplest form. 



SBI'O. Petites Timbales de Riz. 



AUX FRUITS 



Let there be no mystery about these. They are 
little indiviJual rice cakes, but they caaaot be de- 
scribed, only suggested, fjr they are but the cook's 
notions, and are more than chameleon like, they 
ehange shape as well as color. 

They are of no consequence — on^y passing; fan- 
cies. They are unlocked for contingencies; unex 
pected circumstances; dernier resorts; put in to fill 
up the bill, to decorate and set off the row of little 
dinner dishes before the guest. There are camaos 
and there are stage scenes laid on with a whitewash 
brush; both are'meritorous in their place. When 
the cook is tired of cuttifn^ out rice or farina or ta- 
pioca cakes in squares, and dishing up charottes 
with a spoon, he takes some means of giving to e:ich 
person an uncut, untouched and more or less deco 
rated trifle in symmetrical shape. The main com 
pound for these little rice shapes is already found in 
the rice cake plain, preceding. A suggestion of va 
riation is found in the rice cake with fruits. Sup- 
pose you take muffin rings, brush them inside with 
butter, coat them with fine grated bread crumbs, 
fill with rice cake, bake brown and serve a green 
gage plum stewed in bright syrup, or halt an apri 
cot, or three red cherries with the thick juice on top. 
Or, instead of rings, take some handsome stamped 
gem pans, the deeper and more pyramidal the bet- 
ter, and on the buttered sides place some shapes cut 
with your fancy vegetable cutters out of the greenest 
candied citron, or watermelon rind; or else, instead 
of bread crumbs, use finely chopped yolks of eggs; 
or, instead of any of th^^^se, make some nouillps 
paste — which is flour moistened with yolk of egg, 
with a little salt and pothing else, and worked to 
smoothness — and cut.leives, etc., out of that Ttien 
place rice cake round, over the patterns— a sort of 
wall or casing— and inside fill with preserved fruit, 
jam or conserve. After baking these may be turned 
out, glazed with yolk of egg and milk or sugar, and 
quickly browned again. Sometimes lit ie rice 
cakes, not sweetened, are baked in the tiniest gem 
pans holding scirce a tablespoonfu!, and are served 
as decorations of entrees, and with fish. 

3 TI. Plain Boiled Rice Pudding. 

The writer has not found occasion to be much 
concerned about boiled puddings of rice; hotel peo 
pie who require anything so plain being amply sat- 
isfied with the rice prepared for a vegetable dish. 
If, however, the competition of the other restaurant 
is so severe that one must give good meals for ten, 



or fifteen, or twenty cents, or if there is Chinese 
help to be fed, a boiled rice pudding is not so bad. 
Besides, we have Dr. Andrew Combe's "Physiology 
of Digestion" to prove that it is the easiest of digep 
tion of all puddings, and therefore commended to 
dyspeptics. 

Waih a pint of rice; mix a handful or two of 
either raisins, currants or apples with it, tie up in a 
cloth with room enough to swell to three pints; put 
on in cold water and boil about an hour. Syrup or 
molasses fur s uce. 



If the foregoing is a "poor man's pudding," the 
next must certainly be his rich relation's. It can 
be hands me'y >urned out of a handsome mould 
and the rich custard poured round. It will not be 
good unless the tapi -ca be thoroughly s a' el as di 
rected, and may take ^ pint more milk; the re- 
ceipt is on the safe side for turning out in good 
shape. 

Steamed Tapioca Puddini?, with Custard 
S^S. Sauce. 

1 pound of tapioca 

3 pints of milk. 

^ pound of sugar. 

3 ounces of butter. 

G yolks of eggs. 

8 whole ejgs. Salt. 

1 lemon, juice aad grated rind. 

S'oak the tapioca in most of the milk in a warm 
place 2 hours. Then boil the remaining mi'k with 
the salt, sugar and butter; turn iu the s aked tapi- 
oca, let simmer 15 mi; utes with the steam shut in;

moulds, put in the mixture, and steam one and one- 
half hours. 



STEAMED SAGO PUDDINQ. 
STEAMED GROUND RICE PUDDING. 
STEAMED FARINA PUDDING. 

These can all be made by the foregoing receipt, 
but of farina use 2 ounces less, as it absorbs more 
liquid than the other substances. 



Enough has been said about rice cakes and tim- 
bales to dismiss the subject, but here is the sam© 
thing done in tapioca. 

3T4. 

Tapioca Cake, "with Apple Jelly. 



f pound of tipioca.

Orange flavoring. Salt. 
Soak the tapioca an hour or two in half the milk. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



89 



Boil the rest of the milk with the sugar f>nd salt in 
it; stir iu the tapioca and let cook gently half an 
hour. Then beat in the butter, eggs and flavoring 
and bake like rice cake, an iuch deep. 

375. Tapioca Custard Pudding. 



f pound of tapioca. 

8 pints of milk. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

3 ounces of butter. 

8 yolks and 

2 whole eggs, Salt. 

Grated lemon rind or other flavor. 

Sift the dust from tapioca. Sometimes it is bet- 
ter to wash it, besides, like rice. Soak it in half 
the milk about two hours in a warm place. Boil the 
rest of the milk with the sugar in it — the sugar pre- 
vents burning at bottom — cook the soaked tapioca 
in it about half an hour. Beat the eggs, mix all to- 
gether ani bake only till the puddings are just set 
in the middle, lest the custard in it curdle and sep- 
arate instead of being creamy rich. Any hot, clear, 
transparent sauce or lemon eyiup suits, also brandy 
and wine sauces. This pudding is often served coM 
with sweetened cream. Also may be cut cold in 
shapes, egged, breaded, and fried as fritters. 

Does it seem like extravagance to call for so many 
yolks of eggs for puddings ? Is is not. What 
might be so regarded in private house work is really 
the greatest economy in hotels where each fresh 
meal is required to be as good as the one that pre- 
ceded it, and the whites of eggs left over are needed 
in a hundred ways. The whites do no more good in 
puddings than so much flour or starch. The yo!ks 
give the richness and fine color. Probably at an- 
other time we shall have a talk about silver cakes, 
snow cakes and a dozen others made with white of 
eggs, white cocoanut pies, white whips and floats, 
and the meringues must not be forgot. 

3 TO. Tapioca Custard Meringue. 

Make the tapioca pudding preceding. When 
baked spread over the top some lemon conserve or 
orange marmalade. Beat whatever whites are left 
over to a froth; add sugar, about an ounce to each 
white, lightly stirred in, and vanilla flavor. Make 
the top of the pudding baking-hot again, then spread 
on the meringue and dry-bal e. 



3TT, Farina Custard Pudding. 



2 quarts of milk. 

7 ounces of farina. 
6 ounces of sugar. 
4 ounces of butter. 

8 yolks, or else 5 whole eggs. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it and a pinch of 



salt. Sprinkle in the farina dry, beating all tna 
while with the large eggwhip to avoid having; 
lumps in it, as if making mush. Let the farina cook 
slowly half an hour or more Farina kettles net 
needed when there is sugar in the mixture, and set 
at the back of the range. Then mix in the butter 
and beaten eggs. Bake in two buttered pans about 
20 minutes. 

3Y8. 

Farina Cake, with Quince Jelly. 



Make same as tapioca cake; an ounce less farina 
and no soaking needed. 

Farina Cake, with Fruit, Rum Sauce. 

Raisins, currants and citron baked in the farina

Small timbales on the same plan.

"Now, Jerry, the bill of fare — what pudding to- 
day ?" 

"1 thought I would give you steamed p:und if that 
will suit.'' 

"Will suit first rate if you don't fail with it." 

"Fail ? — fail ? — there's no such word as fail I" 
* * * 

"Well, Jerry, it is time to dish up ihe puddings. 
How are they ? Look at them." 

"Failed failed — by the holypoker I" 

"Now, Jerry, this is too much for human nature. 
There is no need to fail with steamed cake-puddings. 
There is a reason for everything, and pound pud- 
ding fails only because either there is too much 
sugar in the mixture or else because it does not get 
done enough. Now your mixture is all light but 
your puddings are not done. There is a white, 
light layer on top where the steam was hottest, but 
all the rest is gum and sugar. Steamed sponge 
puddings are the easiest to cook; they take from an 
hour and a quarter upwards according to size. 
Pound puddings come next, but they must have near 
two hours, unless very small. Steamed fruit pud- 
dings take much longer. If you go to a high point 
in the mountains your puddings need to steam 
longer still. And remember the water below must 
never stop boiling, and time counte nothing if you 
have no steam up." 



Now who would have thought there was another 
pudding of bread, more or less, lurking back here ? 
gorry they are so numerous, but this is a very good 
one and steamed puddings are in demand.

381. Steamed Bread Puddinir. 



1 J pounds of white bread crumbs. 

1^ pound of sugar. 

I pound of butter. 

1 quart of milk. 

4 whole eggs and 

8 yolks. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Lemon rind or extract. 

Mix the bread crumbs and sugar together. Put 
the butter in the milk and boil them. Pour the 
boiling milk and butter over the bread and let stand 
awhile to steep. Beat the eggs and yolks together 
and mix them in; the flavoring, baking powder, then 
beat all together 2 or 3 minutes. Steam an hour or 
little longer in two buttered mou'ds. Serve with 
hard sauce, meringue sauce, butter sauce or maple 
syrup. Better write it a finer name on the bill-of- 
fare. 



38;S. Steamed Sponge Pudding. 



WINE OR BRANDY SAUCE. 



14 ounces of granulated sugar. 

12 eggs. 

14 ounces of finest flour. 

Vanilla flavor, about two teaspoonfuls. 

Beat the sugar and eggs together in a kettle half 
an hour by the clock. You can't time it by the arm 
ache, as ten minutes seems half an hour that way. 
Have the ingredients all cold and beat in a cool 
place. When the time is up the kettle will be half 
full of a foamy batter. Then stir in the flour in 
portions. Do not beat but stir round till the flour 
is pretty well mingled and out of sight. Add the 
vanilla extiact. To be perfect all sponge cake ar 
tides must be cooked as soon as the batter is fin- 
ished. Steam it in pudding moulds, jelly moulds, 
melon moulds or any kind you like — no matter 
about lids — about an hour and a half. 

Whenever any of these cake mixture puddings 
seem to be heavy or sticky, provided the fault is not 
in the steaming, they may be corrected next time 
by using a .trifle less sugar. At great aUitudes 
the sugar has to be considerably less, and newly ar- 
rived pastry cooks are often "thrown" through not 
understanding or being willing to believe it. 

383, Steamed Pound Pudding. 



BRANDY, WINE OR CURACOA SAUCE. 



f pound of white sugar. 
I pound of fresh butter. 
10 eggs. 
1 pound of flour. 

Cream the butter and sugar together by warming 
and beating. Beat in the eggs, one or two at a time, 



then the flour in small portions. To beat the mix 
ture after flour is all in makes the pudding fin« 
grained and whiter, but not so light. Don't beat it 
much. Steam in fancy tall moulds if to go to table 
whole; to be dished up in slices any sort of cake or 
jelly moulds suit. 

These puddings need to be put on in good tight 
steamers when the water is already boiling, anl be 
kept steaming 1| hours, or longer. 

Pretty name, isn't it ? the next, sultana pudding. 
It is not going to be told here how it compares in 
goodness with the queen pudding which ve had 
away back, because a comparison between a queen 
and a sultana would be odious. However, this is a 
white rose.

Sultana Pudding. 



RED WINE SAUCE. 



^ pound of granulated sugar. 

^ pound of fresh butter. 

^ pound of white of eggs (9 whites). 

^ cupful of milk. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

1 pound of flour. 

^ cup of brandy. 

1 pound of sultana raisins. 

Cream the butter and sugar together as for pound 
cake. Add the whites same way — not previously 
beaten. Then mix in the baking powder, after that 
the flour, milt , brandy, raisins. Steam in moulds 
from 1^ to 2 hours. The wine sauce served with 
this pudding should have a lemon cut up in it. 
Raspberry vinegar is an excellent sauce for puddings 
of the above description. 

385. 

Steamed Ooccanut Pudding. 

WITH ORANGE JELLY. 



The same mixture as the preceding with ^ pound 
of cocoanut and some lemon extract instead of rais- 
ins and brandy. Almonds, citron, cherries and 
other fruits can be used in like manner. 

The same useful mixture also makes a good white 
cake, white raisin cake, etc. 

There is something almost apalling in the vaulting 
ambition ofthese cooks when they set themselves to 
naming puddings. How blest, then, is our lot, 
that for the purposes of this writing we are without 
the bounds of Great Britain and of Canada, other- 
wise we, the reader and the scribe, should inevitably 
encounter and have to pay attentions t ), let us see — 
"Her Majesty's pudding,'' "Empress Josephine's 
pudding," "Queen Mab's pudding " 

This last is cosmopolitan, however, and is a nice 
enough little pudding, but too fairy like to be eaten

wit-h a knife and fork. There is good reason fo 
believing that it is not a Spenserite at all, but a 
tawny Italian cream pretending to come accredited 
from 

"The court of Mab and of the faery king." 
Then there would be "Princess Louise's pudding," 
"Beatrice pudding," and Marie Stuart's and Sir 
Watkins'. Besides, there would be shadows in the 
distance of the illustrious Lord Dundreary's pud- 
ding and the honorable Earl of Flaxton's. So every 
cloud has its silver lining. We might be worse off. 
As it is, we already have the queen rose of the rose 
bud gar — I mean we already have the "queen of pud- 
dings" and the Sultana Scheherezade's fa v — atleast, 
that is, we have a very white sultaoa raisin pudding 
with carmine chee — that is to say, with carmine col- 
ored sauce; we have the king pudding that rules the 
British roost, laurel crowned, with all his fierce snap- 
dragon flames around him; the socialist Jack Cade of 
puddings is coming on his way, and how do we know 
but that to meet and dispute with gi'eat Haggis, the 
highland chief, there will arise from our steaming 
cauldron a stalwart Tuscarora chief, in a yellow 
mantle, with silk and tassel, just as be won over 
his Minnehaha long ago, whatever her name may 
have been then. Meantime make way for the great; 
here comes imperial pudding. It is still a question 
whether this should be regarded as a 1' imperial or 
a r imperiale, but as pudding is masculine in 
French probably it is imperial. No doubt but in 
this case the empress h id it made to suit the empe- 
ror, and not to suit herself, which makes it all the 
more remarkable. 



380. Imperial Steamed Puddingr. 

14 ounces of butter. 
12 ounces of sugar. 
11 eggs. 

1 pound of flour. 

Lemon and nutmeg extracts. 

I pound of almonds. 

i^ pound of citron. 

^ pound of raisics. 

Mix the former ingredients as if for pound cake. 
Sca'd, peel and chop the almonds, cut the citron in 
sbreds and take the seeds out of the raisins. Before 
adding the fruit to the cake mixture dust it well 
with 2 ounces more flour. 

Steam in ornamental moulds about 2 J hours Lem 
on, brandy, wine, meringue or sabayon sauce. 



Steamed Fruit Pudding. 
38T. Pudding. 



Pound Fruit 



14 ounces of butter. 
12 ounces of sugar. 
11 eggs. 

1 pound of flour. 

1 teaspoonful of mixed ground spioes. 



1 lemon, juice and grated rind. 

^ cup of brandy. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 pound of currants. 

^ pounl of citron. 

The first four articles are to be mixed first, as us- 
ual for cake, then the others added, not forgetting 
to dust the fruit well wi'h flour. 

It is one cf the most satisfactory puddings to make 
for hotel use; being reaUy a good plum pudding to 
replace the boiled, which requires twice as much 
time, Steam these fully 3 hour?; longer if in large 
moulds. 

388. 

Individual Steamed Puddicgs. 

Steam any of the foregoing varieties, and any oth- 
er kinds made of cake mixtures in eg? cups. They 
rise rounded on top and do not fall like so.ifiles. 
From 30 minutes to one hour is required for steam- 
ing, according to the lind, sponge puddings being 
soonest done. In restaurants they are commonly 
served in the cups with sauce in a little pitcher 
separate; but may be turned out and served in 
saucers as well. 



389. Steamed Cabinet Pudding. 

2 quarts of slices of cake. 
4 ounces of butter. 

^ pound of citron shred fine. 

3 pints of milk. 
8 eggs. 

^ cupful of red currant jelly. 

Sponge cake is best. A 2 quart milk pan will 
measure the slices. 

Use shallow pudding moulds having lids. Stick 
the shreds of citron around the insides on a coating 
of butter. Spread one side of the cake slices very 
fhinly with butter, the other side with jelly, and 
pile them in «hc mou'ds, not to fit tight. Beat the 
milk and eg^s together — no sugar needed— pour 
over the cake; when absorbed fill up again, fteam 
1^ hours. Turn the puddings out of the mouldsand 
serve whether who^e (r in slices with either merin* 
gue sauce or sauce ecumante poured over.

The same ingredients and amounts as the preced- 
ing. Cut the slices of cake wiih a small round, oc- 
tagonal or scalloped cutter, spread them with but. 
ter and jelly and pile them in custard cups. Fill 
with the mixed eggs and milk and refill when the 
first is soaked in Steam half au hour with a clo h 
over the s' earner under the lid to prevent diopping 
of water. Place a spoonfu! of meringue on top of 
each one when they are turned out of the cups, and 
brown them slightly with a red hot salamander or 
shovel held over.

391 , Steamed Brandy Pudding. 



2 quarts of slices of cake. 

^ pint of braody. 

^ pint of finely chopped, seedless raisins. 

4 ounces of butter. 

2 J pints of milk. 

8 eggs. 

J pound of almonds, blanched and split. 

Line the moulds with the split almonds stuck to a 
thin coating of butter. Spread the miuced raisins 
upon the slices of cake; fill up the moulds, sprink- 
ling in the brandy by spoonfuls, and the rest of the 
butter in bits. Then beat the eggs and milk together, 
pour in all the moulds will hold and the cake will 
absorb. Steam 1| hours. 

SOS. 

Individual Macaroon Puddings. 



Have as many egg or custard cups as there will 
probably be orders, about 40, and brush the insides 
with melted butter. PI ice in the bottom of each a small 
round sponge drop. Cover that with a thin layer of 
finely chopped raisins; ont hat place a maciroon and 
in that way fill the cup. The caVes must be sp'it if 
not thin. Make a rich cus'ard with 7 eggs beaten 
n a quart of thin cream and 2 ounces of sugar. 
Fill in with a spoon all the cakes will absorb. Steam 
half an hour. Serve in the cups with whipped 
cream, sweetened and flavored, piled on top. 

SOS. 

Pineapple Puddings Souffles. 

2 pounds of pineapple. 

1 pound of sugar. 

2 ounces of best butter. 

^ pint, scant, of the pineapple juice. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
16 eggs. 

Grate the pineapple if fresh, if canned mash fine 
as possible adding the sugar at last to assist in re- 
ducing it to pulp. Then stir the pulp isith the 
sugar and butter in it over the fire. Mix the starch 
with the juice and add to the fruit, and let it thick- 
en, after which add 8 yolks ot eggs, beat them in 
and let all cook 5 to 10 minutes longer, and then 
set the mixture away to cool. 

Then beat the remaining 8 yolks in a bowl with a 
Dover egg beater. Whip the 16 whites to a firm 
froth that will not fall out of the bowl upside down, 
and stir in first the yolks and then the whites, 
lightly and without beating the mixture at all. 
Bake as soon as made in about 40 custard cups, 
buttered, or in silver scallops or shells, or else in 
paper cases. Ten minutes in a moderate oven is 
the time required to bake. Dredge powdered 
sugar on top before removing quite from the oven. 

The preceding receipt will answer as well for sev 
eral other varieties as if a column or two of repetitions 



were written. Pears, quinces, apples, bananas, per- 
haps other dry fruits may be used as well as pine- 
apple. The starch is to counteract the juiciness; 
with certain mealy kinds of apples it would not be 
needed. Bread or cracker crumbs have the same 
effect. 8 yolks are cooked in the mix'ure and 8 
well beaten are added raw. The whites must be 
beaten quite firm, and a wire whisk is the best to use 
for that purpose. The mixture when finished is as 
light and foamy as sponge cake batter. It rises and 
bakes cream color in the cups or cases Paper casts 
should be buttered icside and half baked befoie be- 
ing filled, and should be filled to the top to lo^jk 
well when done. Caiefully wipe the cut sides of 
cups before baking. These little fruit puff pud- 
dings may be liked better with the addition of plain, 
thick cream for sauce. Some people would add nut- 
meg or cinnamon cr bratidy to the composition of 
apple puffs. Any of these mixtures left over will do 
to fill tarts in patty pans. These are no better than 
other puddings. Ihey are a^l good.

Make the precedir.g pineapple souffle mixture in 
all respects as directed, and bake in deep tin gem 
pans or dariole moulds well buttered. Bake ten or 
fifteen minutes, keep hot, light and spongy as possi- 
ble without drying them. Take out wi h a small 
knife and dish up in saucers with cream sauce. 



There need be nothing wasted. The two forego- 
ing compositions and the one to follow all make nice 
cream pies if diluted with a pint of milk, or with a 
quart of milk and 2 eggs. 



S05. Lemon Sponge Pudding 

A SOUFFLE TO BE SERVED WHOLE. 

2 pounds of grated ripe apples. 

1 pound of sugar. 

2 ounces of butter. 

4 lemons, grated rind of all, juice of 2. 

^ cup of milk. 

2 ounces of corn starch or flour. 
16 eggs. 

Make according to directions for the pineapple 
souffles. Bake in a silver dish or mould that will 
hoM 3 quarts Pin a band of buttered paper around 
the moull to make it higher. Fill with the lemon 
sponge m'xture and bake about half an hour. 
Dredge vanilla flavored sugar on top in the oven. 
Take off" the paper just before sending to the table. 
Sauce doree, or butter sauce with nutmeg or cream. 
It can of course be baked in individual style as well 
aa the others. 



THE AMEBIOAN PASTRY COOK. 



In old times, a -very long while ago, there lived a 
race of hotel cooks who ran in such a very little 
narrow rut, and had such very small resources in 
their trade that when they had made about three 
diflFerent puddings they were at their wit's end, and 
used to have to butt their heads against the wall to 
shake up their memories, so they would know what 
on earth to make next. Then they would recollect 
something to make which required almonds, raisins 
and citron; but when they ran to the hotel store- 
room they found none of those articles in stock. 
Then they had to butt their heads against the wall 
again harder, till they could think of something else, 
and that would require apples. But the store room 
would be bare of apples also. And then they had 
to go and find a harder place in the wall and butt 
their heads against it harder and longer every time. 
That was in the dark ages. What charity it would 
have been, and what suffering it would have pre- 
vented if some person had stood up and told them 
what they might do in the case of a short store- 
room. How if they had no bread they could use 
cake; if they had no yolks of eggs they could make 
a pudding of the whites; if they had no eggs at all 
nor milk they could do just as well with a pudding 
that would be ruined if even milk or eggs came 
near it; and if they had no pineapples they could do 
Tery well indeed with pumpkins. 



Pumpkin pudding must be older than pumpkin 
pie, because pumpkin pie is pumpkin pudding over 
the water. The first appearance of pumpkin in his- 
tory is in the story of a young person named Cin 
derella, who, finding her fine coach was changed 
again into nothing but a hateful pumpkin that came 
rolling up to the door, felt vexed, and thought she 
would make a pudding of it. 

300. 

New England Pumpkin Pudding. 

3 pounds of dry stewed pumpkin. 

^ pound of sugar or maple syrup. 

6 ounces of butter. 

1 pint of cream. 
10 eggs. 

^ a nutmeg grated. 

^ teaspoonful of grated cinnamon. 

Steam the pumpkin and mash the required amount 
through a colander, as dry as possible. It is gener- 
ally well worth while to stew down the pumpkin 
with the sugar and butter in — which prevents burn- 
ing — till it has become thick and transparent. Then 
add the cream and eggs well beaten together, and the 
spices. Bake in two buttered pudding pans about 
half an hour. Is best when just done, but good 
either hot or cold. Brandy, rum or wine are some- 
times mixed in; but not necessary. 



Squash pudding can be made by the foregoing re- 
ceipt. Once and again I made the following for a 



crowd of passengers aground on a steamboat up tbr 
Arkansas, and they were glad 1 could. 

39T. 

Baked Millet Seed Pudding. 



1 ^ pounds of millet seed. 

2 quarts of milk and water. 
6 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

5 eggs. Little salt. 

1 quart more milk to mix up. 

Nutmeg flavor. 

Wash the millet seed and let it cook at the back 
of the range about 3 hours, in the 2 quarts of milk 
and water; Then mash it a little and mix in the 
rest of the ingredients. Raisins, currants, etc., 
may be added. The preceding is a trifle richer in 
eggs than the steamboat pudding was. Syrup for 
sauce. 



398. Baked Yam Pudding. 

Sweet potatoes will do, but the large yams grown 
in the sandy soils of Louisiana and Texas are better 
for mealiness, and have less of the potato flavor. 
1^- pounds of potato. 

I pound of fresh butter. 

^ pound of sugar. 
12 eggs. 

I pint of brandy. 

^ pint of sherry. 

1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract. 

Boil the yams or sweet potatoes after paring, in 
salted water, and mash the required amount of dry 
puree through a colander. Mix in the butter whi'e 
still warm, then the sugar, liquorand vanilla. Sep- 
arate the eggs, beat the yolks into the mixture, and 
the whites after whipping to a firm froth. Bake in 
buttered pans about half an hour. Lemon syrup 
or wine or brandy sauce. 



Common potatoes that are very good and mealy 
can be used in the preceding manner, with more 
sugar and less wine. 

399. Steamed Yam Pudding. 



1 pound of potato, 
^ pound of butter. 

2 ounces of flour. 

3 ounces of sugar. 
8 yolks of eggs. 

4 whites. 

J cup of brandy. 

Vanilla flavoring. 

Pare and boil the yam or sweet potatoes in salted 
water. iVJash the required amount through a 
strainer. Add all the ingredients except the whites, 
beat well, whip the whites to a froth and stir in

Baked Cracked Wheat Puddingr. 



2 heaping quarts of cracked wheat, already well 
cooked and dry. 

6 ounces of butter, 
i^ pound of sugar. 

3 pints of milk. 

6 eggs (or 8 yolks). 

Cinnamon extract or grated nutmeg. 

The cracked wheat must be dry, else use a pint 
less milk. Thoroughly mix all, the butter first 
while the wheat is hot. Bake in two buttered pans 
about half an hour. Vanilla transparent sauce or 
almost any other kind. 

401. 

Brown Cracked Wheat Pudding". West 
Point Pudding. Graham Pudding. 



2 heaping quarts of cracked wheat mush. 

^ pound of molasses (a small cup). 

6 ounces of butter or chopped suet. 

6 eggs. 

li^ pints of milk. 

1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. 

^ pound of raisins. 

.Mix and beat all the ingredients together, except 
raisins, the beaten eggs to be added last Strew the 
raisins on top in the pans; they sink if stirred in. 
Bake an hour. Maple syrup with butter for sauce. 



One large pint of cracked wheat raw will ma^e 
the above amount. The mush is expected to be dry, 
else use less milk or more eggs. The pudding has 
to be apparently quite fluid when put in the oven 
but comes out firm enough. When either of the pre 
ceding puddings are to be made, extra wheat should 
be put on for the breakfast mush, to secure the 
benefit of the three hours cooking. When the mush 
happens to be cold, mash it with the milk made hot, 
so as to have no lumps. Those are favorite pud- 
dings and worth attention. 



Speaking'of those titled personages brings to mind 
the Marchioness. Dickens' Marchioness and Dick 
Swiveller. We have particular business with Dick 
Swiveller, for he must have been the author and 
originator of the word duflF, as applied to pudding 
Else whence comes duflF ? It is a word severely let 
alone by many people under the impression that it 
is slang; but slang is evanescent, this word is stable 
and permanent. It cannot be even a vulgarism, for 
it permeates all through H. B. M's. most respect 
able army and navy as well as the U. S's. Mid- 
shipman Easy undoubtedly used the word duflf for 
pudding, and the entire crew of H M. S, Pinafore 
follow the same practice. It is simply a cockney- 
ism, and cockneyisms extend all over the world. So 



the Greenwich pensioners and the Chelsea pension- 
ers; the Woolwich dock yard hands; the sailors on 
the high seas; the blue-coat children of charity 
marching down the streets and thoroughfares which 
Dickens has made familiar, all have their duflf days 
— suet duflf, currant duflf, plain duflf, plum duflf 
Great days are the days marked by pluoi duflf ! But 
they are not all. Thous nds of fiictory operatives, 
thousands of railroad constructors of British, Cana- 
dian, Australian and American railways all own a 
loving allegiance to King Duflf ! Now who will pre 
sume to laugh at Duflf, with such a followiag, a new 
Jack Cade though he may be? We shall do far bet- 
ter to discuss his merits, as the following pages are 
intended, not only Duflf proper but his family and 
followers. But being but a new-comer, compara- 
tively, taking the place of old pudding, whence 
came the word. Did not some small wit, such as we 
see in Thackeray's barrooms in the Newcomes, pre. 
tending the pudding was not cooked enough, call 
for more dough ? And did not another smallwit 
say if e n o-u g-h spelt enuflf, d-o-u-g-h spelt duflf? 
and they had had enuflf duflf. But this would never 
have gone abroad if Dick SwiveUer had not been 
there. He was a little stage struck and very popu- 
lar at his boarding house. He had taken the Mar* 
chioness to the theatre the night before, and on that 
day they took a sumptuous dinner at a London cheap 
boarding house. So when it came to calling for the 
pudding he remembered the smallwits and shouted 
to the waiter 

"Lay on, Mack— Duflf, and dumb be he that first 
cries, hold, enough !" 

Poor Dick ! he is gone now. But duflf is all over 
the world. In the copper mines of Lake Superior, 
and in the carbonate mines of the Rocky Mountains, 
they call for duflf as glib'y as on board the Alaska 
whalers; and in all those places all our fine pud 
dings would be called duflf just the same 

Infantine pudd'n; feminine pudding; masculine 
duflf. 

But 

•'Quantum suf 
Ficit of duflf." 



Yet here he comes. Shake him heartily. He is 
no popinjay "perfumed like a milliner," with flum- 
meries, frills and furbelows. He is an athlete in 
athletic garb; not now in fighting trim, but mellow 
with doing good; his countenance shining and his 
sides shaking with fatness. Is he rough and plain? 
But think how he goes into the convalescent wards; 
the workhouses; the almshouses, the veteran re. 
treats, the charity scho^-ls, the penitentiaries, the 
very hulks, and they all smile to see him come. 
And what might not happen in barracks army and 
navy training scl'ools in camp and on the sea, were 
the regular weekly visits of this potentate arbitrarily 
forbidden ? Athlete, did we say ? Why, bless u8,

408. Plain Boiled Suet Pudding. 

'2 pounds of flour. 

1 pound of suet. 

IJ pints of water. 

A large teaspoonful of salt. • 

Chop the suet, not too fine, and rub it into the flour. 
Mix with the water. It makes a soft dough. Beat 
it thoroughly with a spoon. Put it in a conical or fun- 
nel-shaped pudding bag, previously wetted and 
floured, and boil about three hours. The water 
should be boiling when the pudding is put in and 
not allowed to stop. The suet makes the pudding 
quite light and rich. Eat with butter and syrup. 



40S. 



Currant Suet Roll, 



IJ pounds of flour. 

1 pound of chopped suet. 

1 pound of currants or raisins. 

1 pint of water. 

Salt. 

Mix altogether. Make the dough into two long 
rolls, solid, tie up in cloths and boil two hours. The 
softer the dough can be to be, handled at all, the 
lighter the pudding will be. 



404. English Suet Pudding. 

2 pounds of flour. 

f pound of chopped suet. 

1 pound of white sugar. 

1 pound of either raisins or currants. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Mix the above together dry, then add 

1 pint of milk. 

2 eggs. 

A small teaspoonful of soda. 

Stir all thoroughly together. Boil in pudding 
bags 4 hours. 

More eggs in this pudding injures it. Can be 
made without any. Butter and sugar, cream sauce, 
or syrup, or any kind of pudding sauce suits. 

405. Boiled Cinnamon Pudding. 



A considerable variation of the preceding pudding 
is made by adding to it 1 heaping teaspoonful of 
ground cinnamon — makes it of a pinkish color. 
Ground ginger may be used in the same way. Give 
all these puddings room to swell and become light 
when tying the pudding bag. 



Jack Cade Duff's relatives moving in the highest so- 
ciety, and presently they will be found next of kin 
to old plum pudding himself. 

40G. Boiled Spice Pudding. 

WITH RUM SAUCE. 



Not a half dozen degrees removed and we find 



A brown suet pudding with molasses and spices. 

2 pounds of flour. 

f pound of chopped suet. 

1 pound of molasses. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices. 

1 smaU teaspoonful of soda. 

1 pint of milk. 

2 eggs. 

Mingle the dry articles together first, then the 
fluids poured in the middle, stir up. Boil 4 hours 
or longer. Transparent sauce with rum, brandy or 
wine. 

The next is a flaxen blonde, that will dispute for 
supremacy with the highest. 

40t. 

Boiled Lemon Pudding. English. 



A lemon suet pudding, pale yellow, rich. 

1 pound of flour. 

1 pound of suet chopped fine. 

1 pound of white bread crumbs. 

I2 pound of white sugar. 

4 lemons. 

4 eggs. 
2 pints of milk. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 level teaspoonful of soda. 

Make the bread crumbs fine either by grating or 
jutting in thinnest slices and squares across. Mix 
all the dry articles together except sod i and saH, 
which dissolve in the milk. Grate the lemon rinds in. 
Mix up with the milk and eggs. Squeeze in the 
lemon juice at last. Tie up in 2 pudding c'otbs, 
wetted and floured, and boil 3 hours. Hard sauce 
cream sauce, golden sauce or wine. 



The missing link in this evolution of puddings 
from duff to English plum is Eve's pudding, which 
can be found easily some distance back, and thence 
back to the place of beginning at plum pudding 
corner. 



Now if it were right and proper or even allowable 
to base an hypothesis upon pudding, we should say 
that the great mistake of. Bulwer's life was in wish- 
ing that his countrymen were Frenchmen and in 
keeping them constantly remin led of his wish; and 
the great mistake of Dickens' life was in sneering at 
Americans fur not being English Dickens was for- 
given because of his world-wide Anglo-Saxonism; 



96 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



Bulwer retains his hold only by sheer strength; 
through the polish and exact fit of his work, not 
through love or indulgence Dickens was English 
even to the chops and tomato sauce of Pickwick and 
all the little bread and cheese and kisses repasts of his 
people. Bulwer sneered at the national Yorkshire 
pudding, and blackberry pudding, and boiled veal, 
and he is not popular. Hotel keepers are mindful 
of the dread warning. When all nations and peo- 
ples shall t|tye come to think alike and eat alike, 
then the i^»ims of the universal peace society will 
be realized and there will be an universal language. 
In the meantime English inn keepers go on provid- 
ing roast beef with Yorkshire pudding; pease pud- 
ding; boiled apple dumplings and tea and toast; and 
American hotel keepers doing business for profit 
keep up the supply of ham and eggs, oyster soup, 
turkey with cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie and 
mince pie, and cofiFee and Parker House rolls All 
easy enough, and no need of stroking the fur the 
wrong way, 

408. Yorkshire Pudding. 



f pound of flour. 

3 pints of milk. 

2 ounces of butter, melted. 
^ 6 eggs. Salt. 

^ teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Have the milk not too cold, else it sets the butter. 
Mix the flour with it by degrees, free from lumps. 
Add butter, salt, powder, the eggs well beaten and 
beat up all thoroughly. Butter a baking pan and 
make it warm in the oven. Pour in the batter less 
than an inch in depth. Bake 15 minutes, or till 
lightly browned. "When the pudding is made with 
water instead of milk add a spoonful of golden syrup 
to cause it to brown quickly. If made without the 
butter it will puff up at the sides, but soon falls and 
becomes tough. 



On the twentieth day of August, eighteen hun- 
dred and fifty-nine, in the heighth of the Pike's 
Peak gold excitement in this country, Yorkshire 
pudding was served for dioner in the palace of 
Prince Frederick William of Prussia. It is best to 
be chronologically particular in noting these histo 
rical events, and this we know was a fact, for we 
have the printed menu with the royal crown and 
the date upon it, just as we have another, showing 
that on the 6th day of July, 1868, His serene High- 
ness, the Sultan of Turkey, entertained Prince Je 
rome Bonaparte, where was served : 

Truffle omelet; poissons frits\ (doesn't say what 
kind of fried fish, but doubtless from the Bosphorus.) 
courgea farcies; (stufi'ed Jonah's gourds); beurek, 
(wasn't that nice?) bi/tecks aux pommes; (the potatoss 
were a la' parisienne, of course); haricots verts; 



(those ubiqutous snap beans !) guephte; (don't you 
wish you had some ?) gelee au marasquin; visnali; 
ekmek. That caps the climax! Though it is not all 
the biil-of fare, only about two thirds 

However, we were trying to say that while we 
know by the documents that Yorkshire pudding was 
served at the palace as stated, the other matter 
which we know quite as well, yet cannoc demon- 
strate, is that the cooks there separated the eggs and 
made the pudding magiificent by beating the whiies 
to a firm froth and stirring them in immediately 
before baking. This is the way the line reads : 

"Roast beef a TAnglaise— York-Pudding '' And 
it is preserved in the "^cuisine classique.*' 



But it is not the Yorkshire pudding they long for 
so much. On these cruel cold days, when even the 
wild animals hedge up close to the cosy settlements 
and the birds find wondrous attractions about the 
kitchen door steps, you may see poor, huugry chil. 
dren flattening their noses against cook shop and 
restaurant windows, gazing, when the inside steam 
allows, upon the luscious puddings, and fain would 
fill their bellies with the crusts that sticV to the 
sides of the pans and no man gives unto them. They 
are huddle 1 in remnants of old shawls and cast off 
coats, twice too big, and dragging on the ground, 
their toes have a too close acquaintance with the 
snow and mire, and all doors are shut. It is not 
the Yorkshire pudding that they wish so much, a'l 
swimming in rich gravy though it be, because that 
is connected with the thought of a piece of brown, 
fat roast beef, and their thoughts dare notmou:.t so 
high; but the pudding beside it, the batter pudding 
with fat in the hollows and raisins snuggling close 
together by twos and threes in the rich dimples. 
Just this square or that, and no man gives unto 
them, 

4015. Batter Pudding. 

WITH RAISINS. 



1^ pounds of flour. 

3 quarts of milk or water. 

4 large basting-spoons of butter, melted. 
2 large basting spoons of golden syrup. 

12 eggs. Salt. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

1 pound of seedless raisins. 

Mix up as you would batter cakes, wetting the 
flour gradually to have no lumps; the milk tepid, 
the butter melted, the eggs well beaten and powder 
and sjrup last. Pour into 2 buttered pans made 
warm an inch deep, and sprinkle the raisins all 
over Bake about 20 minutes, or till light brown. 
Serve in squares with lemon syrup or any puHding 
sauce.

WITH APPLES. 



The preceding, with 2 quarts of apples in quar- 
ters, instead of raisins. The easiest cooking apples 
may be dropped in raw, but others need to be baked 
in the pan with sugar and butter syrup first, and 
the batter poured over them and baked. 



However good a plain pudding may look to hun- 
gry people, there are always others to exert them 
selves to make a better. The credit of the origina 
tion of the following is given to a duchess of Sun- 
derland. As here changed from cup and spoon 
measure it is 0. K.

Sunderland Pudding. 



BATTER PUDDING WITH RAISINS. 



J pound of seedless raisins. 
1 pound of flour. 

1 quart of milk. 

8 eggs, or 10 yolks, and powder. 
4 ounces of butter, melted. 

2 ounces of golden syrup. 
Salt. Baking powder optional. 

The pudding is made with the yolks of eggs. The 
whites are beaten to a firm froth and added last, or, 
if not so beaten, left out, and baking powder — 1 
teaspoonful — used instead. Make like the puddings 
preceding it. 

Birdsnest Pudding. 

For the inside take ten ounces of first quality 
white Chinese edible, glutinous birdsnests. They 
must be taken from the coast rocks on the day they 
are finished building, before they become soiled. 
Three ounces of the purple gelatinous moss from 
Sumatra. Twelve eggs of the golden turtle of Sa 
marcand. Two wine glasses of the liqueur called 
Tears of the widow of Malabar. For the outside or 
casing cut thin shavings of the ripe fruit of the 
Malayan bread-fruit tree; soak them a few hours in 
the clarified oil of fat puppy and — 

What, don't want it ? "Nay, then indeed I am 
unblest" — why not ? 

0, here is a regular Wilkie Collins of a plot. Some 
one has opened the book at the wrong page, and that 
was not it at all. 



4151. 



Birdsnest Pudding. 



WITH CREAM. 



No doubt derives its name from its appearance 
when baked in a small pudding dish and set on the 
table whole. The batter rises round the edges and 
the apples might be supposed to resemble eggs. In 



hotel service it is but an empty name, and this re- 
ceipt makes the puddiag sufficiently soft and custard 
like to stand the waiting of a long dinner. 
10 ounces of flour. 

3 pints of milk. 

^ pound of butter, melted. 

I pound of sugar. 

6 eggs. Salt, 

Apples enough for two three quart pudding pans. 

A little more sugar and butter to bake them 
with. 

Cinnamon or nutmeg. 

Pare and core the apples, put thoax in the pans 
whole. Fill the core holes with sugar and butter; 
grate nutmeg; allow water enough to wet the pans, 
then bake with a thick sheet of paper over till done, 
basting with their syrup occasionally. Then mix 
the other ingredients to a smooth batter, beat it 
well; pour over the coot ed apples; bake half an 
hour. 

First rate cooking apples small enough to be 
served entire with the batter round them are most 
desirable. Cream or cream sauce, or wine or lemon 
sauce. 

413. Poudmg a la St. Croix. 



INDIVIDUAL. 

3 pounds of banana pulp. 
^ pound of sugar. 
6 ounces of butter. 

1 pint of cream. 

12 eggs. Pinch of salt. 
^ pint of West India rum. 
^ teaspoonful of ground mace. 

2 pineapples. 

Peel the bananas and mash them to a pulp; 
weigh; put into a saucepan with the sugar and but- 
ter and stir over the fire till at boiling heat. 

Take it off, add the cream and flavorings, then the 
yolks of the eggs and lastly the whites whipped to a 
firm froth. Bake in custard cups .^r tin gem pans 
of handsome shape, and well buttered, about 10 or 
15 minutes. Slice the pineapples very thinly and 
make liot in a syrup of sugar and red wine. Serve 
the little puddings upside down on a slice or two of 
pineapple in a saucer and the syrup poured over. 



414. Baked Plantain Pudding. 



WITH FRENCH CUSTARD SAUCE. 

3 pints or i»ounds of plantain pulp. 
10 ounces of sugar. 

6 ounces of butter. 

1 pint of cream. 
10 eggs. 

J cupful of sherry. 

1 lemon, juice and grated rind.

THE AMERICAN PASTBY COOK. 



Plantains are not good for this purpose unless 
ripe. Peel and mash; stir over the fire with the 
butter and sugar till cooked semi-transparent; add 
all the ingredients, the eggs beaten separately, or at 
least very light. Bake in a buttered pan about half 
an hour. 



415. Oream Ourd Puddingr. 

1 pound of dry rennet curd (product of about 4 
quarts of milk). 

^ pound of butter. 

f pound: of sugar. 

4 whole eggs. 

6 yolks. Salt. 

^ pound of raisins and currants mixed. 

1 pint of milk. 

^ pound of fine bread crumbs. 

Flavoring of lemon, nutmeg or almond. 

Rub the curd as taken from the cheese vat or 
draining cloth through a seive or strainer by means 
of a masher. Add the other ingredients, the solids 
first, then the beaten eggs and cream, and flavorings. 
Bake in a buttered pudding pan about half an hour. 
Serve with custard or wine sauce. 

416. 

•'See, here is a whole eight-gallon can of milk gone 

sour." 

'•Pity. Those milkmen seldom take pains to 
thoroughly cool their milk before shutting it up in 
the cans." 

"Well, can you make any use of it ?" 
"Yes, it will do very well for the preceding pud- 
ding, and is liked as well as anything else in iis 
turn. Let it get a little better curdled, then bring 
it to about boiling he ^t; mind it don't burn at bot 
tom; then strain through a large towel and hang the 
curd up in the towel to drip dry — about 12 hours 
But take notice, this is not the best. It will be a 
curd pudding lemon flavored, but the sweet cream 
or milk curd made with rennet will make a pudding 
to resemble almonds." 

41T. 

Buy a dry rennet of the butcher. Place a piece 

of it in a bottle and fill up with water. When it has 
stood a few hours mix two or three spoonfuls of the 
liquor in a pan of milk. In two or three hours the 
milk will be curdled Then scald and drain the 
curd. Good for puddings, pies, cheesecakes, etc. 

418. 

Baked Cabinet Pudding. Meringue. 



Made with slices of cake and citron in small 
Blips; custard poured over and baked. 
2 quart panful of slices of cake. 
4 ounces of butter. 
^ pound of citron cut fine. 
2 quarts of milk. 
6 eggs. 

1 lemon, juice and grated rind. 
^ cupful of brandy. 
Meringue for the top. 



Butter two pudding pans. Place in a layer of 
Slices of cake. Then sprinkle in citron and bits of 
batter. Place another layer oa that v/iih citron 
and bu'uter again and there should fctiil be thin 
slices enough left to cover the citron with Mix the 
custard of eggs aud milk — no sugar needed— add 
brandy and lemon juice and rind, pour over the 
cake in the pans and bake about 20 minuies. When 
done meringue over in the way already detailed for 
meringue puddings. V.'hei dry s'ices of cake are 
used the lemon juice is still more needed to freshen 
the flavor. The brandy may be omitted without 
harm. 



A cabinet pudding to be served whole can have 
the citron in patterns on moulds spread with butter. 
Wrap paper about the outsides to prevent too haid 
baking of the crust. Bake half an hour. Meringue 
after turning out and brown the top with a red hot 
shovel. 



Life is full of such compensations as these. 
Forbidden to use bread any more in cur puddings 
we must manage to get along with cake. But wait, 
befure commencing on the laborious savo/ cake 
puddings there is something else. 

What a world of Aunt Betsey Trotwoods there 
used to be eating arrowroot pcdding f.r the sake of 
poor blacks that never existed, with a solicitude 
like hers for Copperfield's imaginary sister ! It is 
plain it was an advertising scheme. The argument 
was : there are those poor blacls in the West In- 
dies; you have caused them to be freed from bond- 
age; there is nothing they can do for a living but 
make arrowroot; if they cannot sell their arrowroot 
they will die, therefore, to save their lives, you 
must e it arrowroot pudding. Then arrowroot found 
a good market and the great majority of all the gold 
spectacled people in the civilized world were eating 
all they couM. The gold spectacle distinction has 
to be made because people below that rank could 
not very well aflford it as the poor people who made 
arrowroot would have died if they had not sold it 
at a high price. Eating arrowroot pud ling is not 
Euch a very unpleasant way of being benevolent, 
but, bless their kind hearts, there came a time when 
the gold spectacles could not possibly eat any more, 
and barrels of arrowroot lined with blue paper be- 
came uncomfortably numerous in the merchants' 
warehouses. Then they began mixing it with rice 
flour and starch and reducing the price, and there 
never being a very striking difference between starch 
and arrowroot the cheap article has at last very 
nearly banished arrowroot altogether, except from 
the drug stores. All the annexed receipts for 
starch puddings will do equally well for arrow- 
root, in case there are any people solicitous for the 
welfare of arrowroot manufacturers still left in this 
world

Boiled Corn Starch Puddingr- Oorn 

Starch Minute Pudding. Hasty 
410, Pudding. 



2 quarts of milk. 

^ pound of sugar. 

^ pound of corn starch, good weight. 

2 ounces of butter. 

2 or 3 yolks of eggs. 

^ teaspoouful of salt. 

Vanilla or almond flavoring. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it. Mix the 
starch with a little milk cold; thin it with some hot 
milk out of the kettle; pour it quic'ily into the boil- 
ing milk and stir two minutes, or till it is well 
thickened. Have ready the two yolks beaten with 
a spoonful of milk, take oflF the kettle, beat the 
yolks in, the heat of the starch will cook them, then 
the butter an i flavorings. Turn the pudding out of 
the kettle it was made in to a bright pan buttered 
slightly, and keep warm till wanted. Serve with 
lemon syrup sauce or with hot cream. 



There are not many puddings as cheap and simple 
as that. Nothing else is so quick, and it is never 
s'ighted at table. "But why was it, the pudding so 
nice and rich and firm when first made afterwards 
turned to liquid in the pan and could not be dished 
up?" 

It was kept too hot and cooked too much. 



4SO. Boiled Farina Pudding. 



2 quarts of milk. 
J pound of sugar. 
7 ounces of farina. 
4 ounces of butter 

3 yolks of eggs. 
Salt and flavoring. 

Nearly the same as corn starch pudding. Boil 
the milk and sugar and sprinkle in the farina dry, 
beating like making mush. Let cook slowly half an 
hour with the lid on, at the back of the range. Then 
add eggs and butter. Lemon, wine, vanilla, cus- 
tard, or cream s^uce. 



♦•Such puddings as the two last come in just 
right for second puddings." 

"What do you mean by second puddings ?— they 
are just right for first." 

"Buttoofiset the rich pudding, just as rich as it 
can be, the other has to be plain and of a lighter 
kind, such as your apple custards and fruit souffles 
and plain rice puddings to suit people of simpler 
tastes" 

"Not now. The fashion of having two hot pud- 
dings at once is abandoned in all the best hotels. 
Instead of matching your puddings, one lich and 
one plain, or one baked and o e steimed, you now 



match your one hot pudding with your oold cream? 
and custards and floats and the pastries, anl fcnn-s 
of these are rich enough to require the pudditig to 
be as simple as the corn starch, if all are to be 
pleased. And don't have a brandy sauce pudding 
at the tame time with a cold tipsy custard — give the 
people who abhor liquor a chance."

Baked Oorn Starch Pudding. 



2 quarts of milk, scant. 

^ pound, good weight, of corn starch. 
4 ounces of sugar. 

3 ounces of butter. 
6 yolks of eggs. 

^ teaspoouful of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of vanilla extract. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it — which prevents 
burning at bottom. Mix up the starch with a little 
cold milk aud then some hot, pour it quickly into 
the boiling milk in the kettle and a' most immedi 
ately, or as soon as fair'y mixed take it off the fi e. 
Beat in the butter immediately to cool it; then the 
yolks beaten up with a spoonful of milk; flavor and 
bake about 20 minutes or till the eggs are fair y 
set Ihe art to be learned in all sorts of corn starch 
puddings is to cook the starch enough so that the 
rawness cann( t be tasted, yet not enough to cause 
it to turn watery. Serve with Sultana sauce. 

4S3. 

Oorn Starch Meringue. New York Pud- 
ding. Oswego Pudding, Etc 

Anyone who has made the nonpareil or queen 
pudding wid understand this in a moment whento^d 
it is the same thing done in c">rn starch. Make the 
pudding of corn starch as in the foregoing receipt 
When barely set in the middle spread over the top — 
or drop portions with a spoon — of p ach mtrmalade 
or preserves. Make that hot on top and spread me- 
ringue of 8 whites whipped firm and 6 ounces of 
sugar over it. Bake again about 5 minutes with the 
oven door open. Cream sauce. 

The writer has seen more partial failures, prob- 
ably, with this class of puddings than with any 
others, and asks to be excused fur dwelling upon 
trifling details for that reason. They are excellent 
when excellently made. The marmalade on top 
must be made cooking hot before the meringue 
touches it if you would avoid having au undesirable 
albuminous syrup overflowing the pudding, and the 
meringue must be only dry-baked. 

There are people who like chocolate in any form 
three times a day, yet the liking is far trom general. 
The following pudding is probably as good as can be 
made of its class. It should only be brought on 
along with some other commoner sort for aiivraa- 
ive.

Corn starch Chocolate Pudding. 
483. 

2 quarts of milk. 

3 ounces of grated chocolate, 
f pound of sugar. 

6 ounces of com starch, 

1 ounce of butter. 

6 or 7 eggs. Pinch of salt. 

1 tab'espoonful of vanilla extract. 

Boil the milk with both the sugar and chocolate 
in it. Beat frequently till the chocolate is all dis- 
solved. Mix the starch as usual and stir it in, then 
immediately remove from the fire. Beat in the but 
ter, eggs and vanilla, and bake about 20 minutes, or 
till just set in the middle. Serve warm with but 
ter sauce or golden sauce, or cold with sweetened 
cream. 

The foregoing makes a very fine appearing pud 
ding when meringued over like the one preceed- 
ingit. 



4!94. Scotch Barley Pudding. 

1 pound of pearl or Scotch barlej. 

2 quarts of water. 
6 ounces of butter. 
8 ounces of sugar. 
6 eggs. Salt. 

1 J pints of milk to mix with. 

^ a nutmeg grated. 

Wash the barley in several waters to free it from 
the meal. Boil it in the 2 quarts of water at' the 
back of the range about 3 hours, with a tight lid on. 
Mix the other ingredients in and bake about half 
an hour. Currants and raisins can be added if de- 
sired. Two full quarts of barley ready cooked, if 
dry, answers the same. 



The reasn for inserting the preceeding good pud- 
ding there in haste was the ever present fear of 
steppi'-g into an American pie if we did not shut off 
corn starch immediately. 

Strange, but true, almost every pudding we touch 
and begin to polish up whisks us up and carries us 
over the water as quick as the genii did those who 
rubbed Aladdhi's lamp. That puddiogs do not 
often beluiig litre is due to the fact that while Uncle 
Sam's childrea love not pudding less they love pie 
more, and are very apt to call all things of native 
origination pieth*it would elsewhere be called pud- 
ding. 1 his has been more than once before observed 
in these columns, and here is an example. There 
were the soldiers "in the late great war, many of 
them from homes of plenty and luxury, little relish- 
ing the rough fare of the a»ni.y commissariat, and 
some genius among them struck a culinary idea and 
invented "Lincoln pie." Wherefore Pie? It was 
a hard tack pudding in reality, but was made pie in 
obedience to a national instinct, and as Lincoln pie 



it had for a time an immense run of popularity far 
outside of the army, being sold in all the bakeries. 
The original was composed of hard-tack, bacon fat, 
molasses and dried apples, with a tough flour crust, 
but fat times and fat camps were occasionally en- 
countered and then Lincoln pie blossomed out to 
this.

Lincoln Pie. 



Camp Little All-Right. 



1 pound of broken cracVers or bread. 

1 pound of brown sugar or^molasses. 

^ pound of currants. 

^ pound of raisins. 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices, chiefly cinna- 
mon. 

1 pint of cold water. 

^ pint of hard cider, or vinegar and water. 

1 pound of suet chop red fine, or lard. 

Some whisky and four eggs, if you are rich 
enough. Little salt. 

£'oak the crackers or bread in the fluids awhile. 
Mix everything together. Cover the bottom of a 
baking pan with a very thin sheet of common short 
paste. Pour in the mixture to be 1^ inches deep. 
Cover with another very thin sheet of paste. Brush 
over with milk. Bake to a light color in a slow 
oven about three quarters of an hour. Cut out 
squares either hot or cold. 



436. 



Plain Short Paste. 



2 pounds of flour. 

^ pound of good lard, butter, drippings,or grated 
suet. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 pint of water. 

A handful of flour more to roll out with. 

Rub the lard into the flour dry, till thoroughly 
mixed. Put in the salt and all the water, work it 
up to a smooth paste, roll it out once like pie paste, 
fold it over and it is ready for use. 

The water should always be poured into a hollow 
in the flour when making any kind of paste, and 
the flour drawn in rapidly but graduaVy while stir- 
ring with the fingers, otherwise the paste may bo 
rough and lumpy and much working to correct the 
mistake will make it hard. 



4ST. Boiled Apple Dumplings. 

Make the plain short paste preceding. Pare and 
core good cooking apples; cut them in halves. Roll 
the paste to a sheet a quarter of an inch thick, put 
the apple under the edge, gather paste around and 
pinch it offunderneath, and so on, till all the sheet 
is used up. See that there are no holes or thin places 
to let in the water. Drop the dumplings into broad 
saucepans of boiling water, shut down the lids; let 
them cook about half an hour, or till the apples 
leave the fork when tried. Short paste cannot be

cherries and a third 's&eet' 6f clbu^h'on top. Set in 
a Bteamer and steam from 30 to 45 minutes and 
serve while hot and light, with sauce, 



ir«ter. 

428. Dumplinsrs Cooked in Sauce. 



Make the dumplings like the last variety, but use 
the roll-pudding paste made with baking-powder as 
directed in the early part of this book, adding an 
egg to the mixing water for further precaution 
against breaking in boiling. Then boil the dump- 
lings in their own sauce in the oven. This is effected 
by half filling two bright and clean baking pans 
with milk and water. When boiling drop in the 
dumplings and cook about half an hour with but- 
tered paper over the top to prevent browning, and 
baste occasionally with the liquor, which will glaze 
them. Then put J pound of sugar and | of butter 
in each pan, and strain the sauce thus made after 
the dumplings have been removed to another pan. 
Peach dumplings are better this way than any 

other. 

420. Raspberry Pudding. 



The directions for making this will answer for 
every kind of fruit that can be used for puddings. 

Make the plain short paste as previously directed 
— if with suet it should be chopped with flour mixed 
in till it is as fine as powder. Line some deep earth-, 
enware bowls of any size from a pint to two quarts 
with the paste rolled out to a thin sheet. Then fill 
quite full and rounded up with fresh-picked rasp- 
berries. Wet the edges of the paste; roll out a 
round sheet of paste and lay it on top; cut off the 
surplus by rolling the edge with the rolling-pin, 
thereby closing it at same time. Wet and flour a 
pudding cloth, lay the middle on top of the pudding, 
gather the corners around the bottom of the bowl 
and tie safely. Drop the pudding upside down into 
plenty of boiling water and keep boiling from one 
to two hours, according to size and kind. When 
done dip the pudding a moment in cold water, take 
off the cloth; cut a>ound hole in the top, put in a 
JBufficienoy of sugar and serve in the bowl set on a 
plate. No sauce needed. Several pleasant com- 
binations of sweet and sour kinds of fruit can be 
made and used in this way; sometimes with a Buit^ 
able sauce. 



All kinds of fruits can be used to make the above 
kind of steamed pudding, which has no shortening, 
but plenty of powder, and has the fruit in layers 
like apple roll. 



430 a. Pine Hominy Puddingf. 

2 large cupfuls of cooked fine hominy — hominy 
grits or sdRnp. 

Butter size of an egg — IJ ounces, 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar — 2 ounces. 

2 yolks or 1 egg. 

1 small cupful of milk. 

The hominy grits already cooked, should be dry 
and firm, otherwise use less milk or none. Mix all 
the ingredients together, the butter softened first, 
and bake in a buttered pudding pan about £fteen 
minutes. It takes a quart pan to bake it in. Use 
yolks of eggs if a rich pudding is wanted. Serve 
with a sauce. If no hominy ready put on a large 
half cupful in full cup of water, and when it has 
boiled nearly dry add a small cup of milk and pinch 
of salt; never stir it, but let cook with a lid on one 
half hour longer, at the back of the range. 



Boiled White Com Meal Pudding. 



430. Steamed Cherry Pudding, 

1 quart of pitted cherries. 
8 heaping cups of flour. 

I teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

2 cupfuls of water. 

Mix the powder in the flour dry, make a hollow 
in the middle, throw in a little salt, pour in the 
water and mix up as soft as it can be handled. 
Work the dough on the table slightly by pressing it 
flat with the hands and doubling over. Lay a bot- 
ton crust of it in a tin pudding pan that holds 4 
quarts; spread half the pitted cherries on it, lay an- 



1 pound of white corn meal (scant quart). 

1 quart milk. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

6 ounces of chopped suet. 

A little salt. 

3 eggs. 

1 lemon, juice and grated rind. 

2 teaspoonfuls of extract ginger. 

Boil the milk with the sugar in it ; sprinkle intht 
meal and stir it over the fire five minutes. 

Then take it off, mix in the suet, salt, eggs beaten 
and ginger. Wet and flour a pudding bag ; place it 
in a bowl; pour in the pudding ; tie loose enough 
for it to swell to nearly double its bulk ; drop in 
plenty of boiling water and keep it boiling 5 hours. 
When to be taken up, dip it a moment in cold water 
and it will come out of the cloth smooth. Serve with 
butter and sugar hard sauce. 



430 c. Granula Puddingf. 

Granula is claimed to be a healthful dietetic of 
the same order as graham flour. It is apparently 
parched wheat ground like corn meal, coarsely. It 
makes a pudding resembling Indian meal pudding. 
Make it precisely as directed for farina, either 
boiled or baked. See Nos. 377 and 420. Use 4 
cups of milk or water to 1 cup of granula.

tried to learn some more rarious uses of the magnifi- 
cent chestnuts which we picked up in passing 
through the grand old manor grounds, but the fear 
of having her shortly answer, "Why roast them in 
the bars and eat them/' deterred me. If there were 
no larger and better chestnuts than these sold so 
plentifu'ly and cheaply on the streets there would 
not be much inducement even for the famous mon- 
ley and catspaw business being foMowed, of placing 
chestnuts between the bars of open fire places till 
they burst and fly out, but the Spanish and British 
chestnuts are of a larger growth. Good old Horace 
Greeley, or at least the paper under his direction, at 
one time became very earnest in recommending (he 
extensive planting of chestnut trees in the west. It 
concerns us here only to hope that the result may be 
after a while plenty of chestnuts of the large variety, 
wherewith to compound the European chestnut 
puddings. 

For hotel cooks who have little time to peel and 
scrape the small chestnuts in quantities, the follow- 
ing two pudding receipts will probably be found 
sufficient, at least till we come to frozen pud- 
dings among the ices. 



There is a meal-co'ored, dumpy little elf, down 
stairs, chuckling audibly and saying there is a good 
deal more in dumplings than a little Short Paste 
knows. The language is that of Marguerite, but 
the accent is either that of Hans or Gretchen. The 
German elves are generally meal-colored. Queer old 
German stories there are of some of them going in a 
rolic to some tyrannical .baron s granaries in the 
myterious small hoursj^^of night, grinding a 1 the 
wheat in a few minutes in the baron s own mill and 
carrying the bags of meal with many a laugh to all 
the widows' and orphans' homes without so much 
as marking them C. D. The noisiest of those 
below is only "Davy Dompling, boiling in the pot," 
but it appears from the ta^k that dumpling is a 
German word, and is not much diflFerent in Swedish, 
Norwegian and Danish. 

There must be something in dumpling worth going 
to Rhineland to see about, but this chestnut pud- 
ding has to be made and steamed and baked first 

The English and French receipts always prescribe 
certain numbers of chestnuts, as two or three dozen. 
It takes from 150 to 200 of the plentiful American 
chestnuts to weigh a pound, hence the uselessnes of 

■uch receip's. 

431. Steamed Chestnut Pudding. 

1 pound of chestnut pulp. 

J pint of cream. 

^ pound of fresh butter. 



J pound of sugar. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

6 whites of eggs. 

Pinch of salt. 

Vanilla or almond flavoring. 

Boil 1|^ pounds of chestnuts in water one hour. 
Peel them, scrape off the furry outside; and mash the 
kernels through a seive, moistening with hot cream. 
Mix all the other ingredients with this puree except 
the whites of eggs; the yolks having been weli 
beaten before stirring in. 

Whip the whites firm, and lightly mix them in 
without beating. Steam in buttered moulds about 
one hour. Serve as soon as done, with diluted 
fruit jelly made hot for sauce, or e'se with French 
wine custard. 

4SS. Chestnut Pudding SoufQe. 

Make the preceding pudding with only six of the 
yolks and no whites. Stir it over the fire till it 
thickens. Take it off and add four raw yolks and 
when nearly cold all the whites beaten firm, and 
^ pint of brandy. Bake in a two-quirt mould 
about half an hour. Dredge vanilla flavored sugar 
over the top in the oven, and send it straight from 
oven to table. Powdered vanilla bean will flavor 
the sugar. 

Very often in the dinner bills of European plan 
hotels there appears in pudding's place ' Savarin 
Cake." Persons unaware of all our singu'ar wajs 
would be apt to think there was no pudding. In 
hotels where the cake is set on the tab'e in baskets 
Savarin cake as pudding is pretty sure to get ost in 
the confusion. In United States parlance Savarin 
ca'je is Savarin pudding as follows: 



Savarin pudding is a hot cake, yeast laised but 
like sponge cake, with a liquor poured into it, and 
may be s'rrved with sweetened cream. My meal- 
colored elf downstairs, the muscular one who sits 
on the dough trough lid to keep the dough from 
raising it, says it takes German ba^^ers atid cooks to 
know how to make fine yeast-raised cakes, that 
American cooks and bakers are content to get along 
with pound and sponge cakes for every occasion. 

In a proposed book of breads yet to come we will 
have a course of yeast raised cakes beginning with 
the simplest and including Savarin. However, the 
common and sitisfactory way U to use a good hot 
sponge or savoy cake for this pudding. Here 

are both ways. 

433. Savarin Cake. 

1 pound of good lively roll dough. 

IJ pounds of freshest buWer. 

G ounces of sugar. 

14 eggs. 

1 pound of flour, 

J teacupful of brandy. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



103 



J pound of almonds. 

Lemon or nutmeg extract. 

This must be commenced five or six hours before 
the meal. For a midday dinner, tike the roll dough, 
(or dough bought of a baker), at seven in the morn- 
ing, put it in a pan with Ihe sugar and butter and 
set in a warm corner to get all warmed through. In 
half an hour, beat tbem together, then begin adding 
the eggs two at a time and the flour a handful at a 
time Beat like blitzen. It makes a soft batter 
like pound cake. Beat it some more against the 
side of the pan. Set it in a moderately warm place 
for about two hours, when it shoud be risen to 
about twice its original bulk, then beat again for 
five minutes; add the brandy and flavoring extract. 
B'anch and shred the almonds. Strew them evenly 
over the insides of two buttered cake moulds; put in 
the batter with a spoon; set to rise in the moulds 
again about IJ hours, then bake in a slow oven 
about 1 hour, or according to size and depth of 
cakes. When nicely baked these cakes are of a rich 
orange color and quite spongy. Set them on the 
dish upside down; push a small funnel down in 
several places and by its means pour into the cake 
some hot orange syrup mixed with curacoa. Serv e 



warm. 
434. 



Savarin Pudding. 



A large bisquit de savoie partly saturated with a 
fine liqueur and served hot with cream. 

Prepare one or two cake moulds by brushing over 
with the clear part of melted butter. When cold 
and set, or nearly so, sift in some powdered sugar 
to coat the moulds, and turn out the surplus. Then 
make the cake. 

14 ounces of granulated sugar. 

12 eggs. 

12 ounces of flour — good weight. 

1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract. 

\ pint of brandy. 

Have the ingredients all quite cold. Beat the 
sugar and eggs in a round bottomed kettle, with a 
arge wire egg-whisk, half an hour by the clock. 
Then "cut in," or lightly stir in the flour with a 
spoon, then the extract and brandy. When all the 
flour is out of sight stop stirring and bake the cakes 
as soon as you can. Sift granulated sugar on top be- 
fore baking. Have a moderate oven and not the 
least dark color about the cakes. They bake easily 
in about half an hour. 

When done pour into them through holes made 
with a knife point or funnel about a pint of nice 
lemon or orange syrup with half as much curacoa 
or maraschino mixed in. Serve with either hot 
cream pweetened or a plain custard in the sau- 
cers. 

In about forty-nine out of every fifty places 
where these puddings are made they have to be 
baked in ranges or stoves, and take their chance for 
their turn with meats, fishes, pies, potatoes, pars- 



nips, etc., etc., so that special attentions and gradu- 
ated fires are out of the question. With the utmost 
respect for the fiftieth, the writer avows a greater 
desire to be of service to the forty- nine, and ^or an 
easier way recommends the annexed. 



435. Tipsy Pudding With Cream. 



This is first cousin to the two preceding, and is 
popular, but is quite elastic in the way of details, 
that is it can be made and sauced in different ways, 
not worth considering separate puddings. Make 
the sponge cake mixture preceding or else tV-e 
quicker and easier butter sponge calie soon to fol- 
low, and bake on jelly cake pans which take scarce 
ly five minutes baking. Lay two or three of these 
flat sheets piled up in a bright pan and pour over a 
hot sauce of either cream with sugar and wine, or 
else a custard with maraschino or brandy Or, you 
can partly saturate the sheets of cake, which should 
be quite light colored, with spoonfuls of brandy and 
have the cus ard plain. 



We have the next when we want to gild refined 
gold, for extra times, when all else seems stale, flat 
and unprofitable. 



is not very tedious to make and there is no difficulty 
except in getting enough of it. 

436. 

Baked Sponge Roll With Sauce. 

Make the sponge cake mixture according to the 
directions under the head of Savarin pudding. 
Rather use less sugar than more. Too much sugar 
is one frequent cause of poor sponge cake. Grease 
and flour some b king sheets or shallow roll pan'. 
Spread the batter over them as thin as can be, jnst 
to cover the iron. Bake in a brisk oven about fire 
minutes, run a knife down the sides to loosen the 
cake. Turn it upside down on a clean table and 
shake the cake loose. 

Immediately ppread red current jelly thinly a 1 
over and roll the cake up neatly. Serve warm, cut 
in suitable pieces, with a rich transparent since con- 
taining lemon juice and flavored poured over. 

It is too much trouble and wastes time to bake 
these sponge sheets on sheets of paper. Very little 
practice is needed to use the bare pan with greater 
advantage. Sometimes it helps a bad bake to roll 
up a britt'e sheet after the roll is made, in a sheet of 
paper to improve its shape. 



No one expected to find the above in a book of 
puddings, but Ruskin says that cookery means th« 
knowledge of all fruits and herbs and balms and

8p!ces, and of all that is healing and sweet in fields 
and groves. • 

We ought not to forget this white cocoanut souffle. 
It is good to use up white of eggs, and good for 
other purposes. 

43 T. Cocoanut Pudding SouflQe. 

1 quart of milk. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

3 ounces of corn starch, 

1 ounce of butter. 

I pound of grated or desicated cocoanut. 

12 whites of eggs, (10 or 12 ounces). 

Rose and lemon flavoiing. 

Set the milk on to boil. 

Mix the starch and sugar together dry; drop 
them at once into the boiling milk; stir up rapidlj. 
As soon as it becomes thick beat in the butter then 
the cocoanut, take it off the fire and let it cool, but 
not set firm. Then beat the whites to a firm froth 
Beat up the pudding mixture, stir in the whites add 
flavoring and bake about ten minutes in the usual 
manner, either in cups, shells, cases or in one round 
mould. Powdered sugar on top. 



This is a case of conscience. A Ittle way back 
tipsy pudding was placed close after Savaria pud- 
ding and called its first cousin, and now there is a 
fear that good old Brillat-Savarin may be dis- 
honored by its being called his, as if it were all 
the same and as if he had been a tipsy 
man. Don't. Names are cheap; use some other. 
Bri lat Savarin was well-disposed towards cooks, as 
was also Lever, the elder Dumas and Thnckeray, each 
after his own manner. You, reader, would make 
the tipsy pudding so excellently that the great ad- 
vocate of gastronomy would but smile indulgently, 
but suppose that down there where bad hotels exist 
some poor fellow following your example of license 
should make it inferentially appear that Savarin was 
fond of sheets of cake saturated with horrible 
corn-juice whisky, and a turpentinish flavor of ran- 
cid lemon oil put up in a village drug store. Don't 
mix names; or if you must, take a slice of fine white 
bread and pour pure milk over it, and call that Sav- 
arin pudding. He would agree with us; bread and 
milk pure and simple i:? glorious in comparison. 



One of Savarin's ideal d'nners, a Barmacide feast 
which he spreads on paper, and which i^ to "rive, 
every guest's altention," at which "the faces of al'; 
one after another, are seen to beam with an ecstasy 
of enjoyment, the perfect repose of b'is?," fi:jishes 
with a pyramid of vanilla and rose meringue cake — 
a test sometiraps useless, unless in the case of ladies, 
abbes, etc." 

What then, amongst the various article to which 
such a description might apply was this pyramid of 
yanilla and rose meringue-cake appearing at the 



end of dinner, if not something like these next 
described? 



A peculiarity about the meringue puddings next 
following (or call them meringue cakes as Savarin 
did, if you like), is that it takes a good p stry cook 
to make them successfully; but then they have the 
advantage of not being too common. They are not 
such as one would want to make every day; yet they 
are rich, elegant, ornamental and can be served 
either cold or hot, whole on the table or in individ- 
ual portions. They consist of three distinct p'trts; 
the cake bottom the cream layer in the middle and 
the ornamental meringue on top; yet the first speci- 
men being well made the half dozen others, all dif- 
ferent, can be put through by the same methods, and 
the first trouble is not lost. 

438. Lemon Cream Meringue. 
Magnolia Meringue 



For the first part or bottom layer make this most 
useful cake mixture, called butter sponge cake. 

1 pound of granulated sugar. 
10 eggs. 

^ pound of butter melted. 

^ pint of milk, slight y warmed. J 

1^ pounds of flour. 

2 teaspoonfuls of bak ing powder. 
Vanilla or lemon flavor. 

Beat the sugar and eggs together about five min- 
utes. Add the melted butter, the milk, the extract 
of vanilla, and beat all one minute more. Then beat 
ill the baking powder, and into the light foamy batter 
thus made immediately stir the flour. 

This can be used for jelly cakes, cream cakes, 
and many other purposes. 

Butter and flour the bottoms of two bright pud- 
ding-pans — four quart milk pans are good — and 
spread the cake batter over thinly, like jelly cakes. 
Bake very light colored. Let the batter be well up 
to the edges so as to have the sheets level, not bulged 
up in the midd e. Then make the lemcn cream. 

3 pints of water — scant. 
I pound of sugar. 

4 lemons. 

3 ounces of corn starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

10 yolks of eggs. 

Boil the water with the butter in it. Mix the 
starch, sugar and grated lemon rinds all together 
'^ry, then stir rapid y into the boiling water. Take 
the mixture from the fire; add to it the juice of three 
of the lemons, (if large), and then the beaten yolks. 

Pour this mixture on top of the sheets of cake in 
the pans, without loosening them, and bake in a 
s'ow oven about 15 minutes on theshe'f c f the oven, 
or with a pan under to prevent the boUoms bak- 
ing too much. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



105 



The preceding is almost lemon pie mixture, but 
fai firm enough to cut square sided like cake. 

When the lemon cream is fairly set spread a thick 
layer of meringue on it while still hot and finish bak- 
ing with the oven door open; time about ten minutes. 
Serve cut in tall but narrow diamonds or squares in 
plates or saucers with whipped cream around. Ten 
to fourteen whites and about as many ounces of 
sugar are required for the meringue. 

430. Almond Cream Meringue. 



Princess Meringue. 



Make and bake the cake sheets in the pans, same 
as for the lemon cream meringue preceding, then 
make the almond as follows: 

3 pints of milk. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

3 ounces of corn starch, 

A pound of almonds. 

1 ounce of butter. 

8 whites of eggs. 

Flavoring of rose. 

Pinch of salt. 

Scald the almonds, peel, mince and then pound 
them to a rough paste. Boil the milk, mix the starch 
and sugar together dry, stir rap idly into the milk, 
take off, and add the other ingredients, the whites 
not beaten, except in the mixtifre, and the almonds 
and rose extract last. 

Bake this white cream on the cakes as before. 
Make the meringue a rose-pink color, flavor with 
vanilla and rose, and sift granulated sugar on top 
before baaing. Serve with a port wine and lemon 
sauce. 

440. 

Chocolate Cream Meringue. 

Gipsy Meringue 

The same in the main as t^^e Iwo preceding with a 
chocolate cream for the middle. 

3 pints of milk. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

3 ounces of grated chocolate. 

3 ounces of corn starch. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

Vanilla flavoring. Little salt. 

Make same way as almond cream, boiling the 
grated chocolate in the milk. Make the meringue 
white and very light baked; flavor it with almond 
•nd sift crimson sugar sand on top after baking. 



The object of baking the sheets of cake in the 
pans in which the meringue is made is to have them 
adhere to the bottom sufficiently to prevent their 
rising and floating in the cream mixture when 
poured in as otherwise they will do. Jelly cake 
sheets used this way have to be held to the bottom 
by means of a little beaten egg, baked by passing 
the pan a moment over the fir© 



441, Pineapple Cream Meringue. 



Eclipse Meringue. 



1 quart of grated or minced pineapple, 

1 small cupful of port wine. 
^ pound of sugar. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
4 ounces of butter. 

1 lemon rind grated. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

^ pound of shred pistachio nuts. 

Stew the minced pineapple and wine and ha'f the 
sugar together, till somewhat r. duced and like fruit 
butter. Mix the starch and the rest of the 
sugar together, stir them and the butter into the 
pineapple, add flavoring and yolks of egg 4. Bake 
this cream on bottom sheets of white cake. AJer- 
ingue over as usual Sift sugar on top before baking 
and strew over the shred pistachio nuts. Dry bake 
to a fawn color with the oven door open. 



When these meringue puddings are to be set on 
the tab'e whole, to be eaten cold the method has to 
be varied a little, by baking on jelly-cake pans with 
a stout paper hoop pinned or pasted around. But- 
ter the paper well, make the meringue in it instead 
of in a pan, then remove it carefully when the me- 
ringue is placed on its stand, being slipped from the 
j lly ca'e fl t by means of a palette knife. In these 
cases the meringue can be placed in pyramidal form 
through a large tube or cornet forming dome shapes 
on top, etc , etc Here is one more for variety: 



443. Orange Cream Meringue. 



Natchez Meringue. 

To ornament the top of this, cindied and sugared 
orange peel should be prepared, or green citron, or 
preserved water melon rind. The orange peel first 
cut into the smallest possible squares is stewed in 
plenty of water to extract the bitter taste, then 
stewed in white syrup, then partly dried and rolled 
in granulated sugar to separate the pieces. Strcw 
this candied peel over the top of meringue after it 
hag become firm without removing it from the oven. 

The orange cream. 

3 oranges. 

1 lemon. 

^ pound of sugar. 

2^ pints of water (5 cups). 

3 ounces of corn starch. 

1 ounce of butter. 

10 yolks of eggs 

Grate the rinds and squeeze the juice of oranges 
and lemon into the water, then bring it to a boil, 
add the starch and sugar and finish as directed foi 
other kinds.

THE A3SIBRICAN PASTRY COOK. 



My meal-colored elf, who still is sitting on the 
dough-trough as before, and converses so well, in » 
rich Hartz Mountain dialect, would be a delightful 
companion to wile away a witching midnight hour 
or two if he were not such an idol breaker. Native of 
Sinta Claus land as he is it wouM be glorious to sit 
in the stilly night, when stars are in the quiet skies 
and the cricket chirrups on the hearth, and hear 
him tell the weird wild stories of the Blac'i Forest, 
or the strange but mellowed legends, half told half 
hinted in the Pilgrims of the Rhine. But his realism 
is chilling in the extreme and he has no feeding of 
compunction: 

"Mephistopheles?" 

♦'No, not numerous. Never but one man really 
saw Mephistopheles, that was Gurthe." 

Then I suppose Gurthe is Goethe, and wonder 
where Sir Walter Scott found the name Gurth for 
his Saxon swineherd. But, says he, there was no 
Gurth, no Wamba,no Ivanhoe, and Friar Tucx never 
had a venison pasty! 

"But the Hartz Mountains — are they not full of 
the supernatural ?" 

"Nein. They are full of charcoal-burners, glass- 
blowers, miners, and people who make childrens' 
toys." 

**No headless horesmen who ride past you at 
night! No white lady of the what's its name moun- 
tain pass? No demons that come and tempt wood- 
choppers to do something? No haunted hotels in 
the Black Forest? No safes, no annunciators, no 
elevators?" 

"Ncin." 

'*No phantom herds of deer that vanish into the 
ground just as the guests on a hunt are about to 
come up with them? No Metheglin? No were- 
wolves, no vampires, no dampfnudeln?'* 

"0, yes, there are German dumplings." 

"Real and sure?" 

*'0, Yes; they are real enough." 

"'Tis well for the hungry boy who shouts with his 
sister at play; and well for the sailor lad 
who sings in his boat on the bay; that this much is 
solid in Fatherland, and cannot be reasoned away " 

443. German PuflF Dumplings. 

Very fine, cheap and wholesome. They are 
Usually boiled but can be raised and cooked in 
Bteamers, previously brushed over with butter as 
well. 

2 pounds of good light bread dough. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

1 egg and 2 yolks, or 2 eggs. 

2 ounces of butter. 
1 pound of flour. 

If for midday dinner take the dough at seven in 
the morning, mix the sugar butter and eggs with it 
as well as can be, then set the pan in a warm place 
awhile, after which it can be beaten smooth. Work 



in the flour to make it a stiff" dough again acd set it 
away to rise. At 11 o'clock work the dough by 
foMing and pressing out with the knuckles roll it 
out to a sheet, brush over s'ightly with lard or but- 
ter, cut out like biscuits, let rise about half an hour 
on greased pans, drop into boiling water and cook 
about 15 minutes Butter and si gar cr any kind 
of pudding sauce, or stewed fruit. 



The plain dough, or that of French roUs is often 
cool^ed as dumpling*? to be ea^en with meat. The 
receipt preceding may be made ri:'her by adding 
yolks'of eggs and more butter (but no more sugnr) 
to any desired degree. 

444. 

Not as a matter of opinion as to what might or 

ught to be the case but as a matter of fact it has to 
be observed cgaui that the plain dumplings yeast- 
raited are but eeldom made in ordinary hotels, the 
».wo or three manipulations required and the ear y 
planning being against them In ten minutes a 
similar article can be made with soda and butter- 
milk or acid, or with baking powder, that answers 
every purpose. It is something of an art to make 
these so that they will remain light when done, yet 
it is a very simple one, the essential being only to 
have the dough very soft, made and dropped with a 
spoon like fritters. 

445, Egg, or Drop Dumplings. 

1 pound or quart of flour. 

2 teaspoonfuls tf baking powder. 

3 yolks of eggs. 

Two thirJs pint of water (largest coff'ee cup.) 

Little salt. 

Mix fljur and powder together dry; drop the 
yolks in the middle, pour the water to them and 
beat up the batter with a spoon. Have ready a 
saucepan of water boiling; dip the spoon occasion 
ally in melted fat; form egg-shaped dumplings with 
it and drop them in. Coek with the lid on about ten 
minutes. If there is room theyl will turn them- 
selves over like fritters. Can also bo steamed as 

well. 

440. Egg Dumplings with Fruit. 

The yellow dumplings of the foregoing receipt, 
drained on a skimmer, rn'-y be EerveJ in a saucer 
with fruit and hot cream and sugar. 

44T. 

Blackberry Drop Dumplings. 

Flour the hands, take and shape spoonfuls of the 
soft-dough — either of the egg dumplings or made 
with one whole egg, or none — into biscuit shapes; 
put a spoonful of ripe berries in the middle, close 
up and drop the dumpUngs into a pan of boiling 
milk and water and cook inside the oven about 
twenty minutes. Baste with the milk and water 
twice to glaze. Serve with sauce. Halves of peaches 
can be used in the same way. 



THE AMERICAN FASTBT COOK.

A little dexterity, acquired by practice in hand 
ling the soft dough is usually rewarded with light 
enow flake affairs that do not turn heavy with 
waiting. 

448. Pilling for Sweet Timbale. 
Baked Macaroni Fuddinif. 



f pound of macaroni. 

3 pints of milk to stew in. 

J pound of sugar. 

J pound of butter. 

1 pint of cream to mix up with 

10 yolks, or 5 whole eggs. 

Salt; vanilla. 

Boil the milk with the sugar and butter in it 
and a pinch of salt. Put in the macaroni broken 
in inch lengths. Simmer with the lid on about half 
an hour. Beat the yolks and cream together, add 
flavoring, mix with the macaroni by shaking, with- 
out a spoon. Bake in a buttered pan about half 
an hour, or till set. Stew raisins in wine sau e 
to serve with it. 

449. 

Macaroni Cake with Fruit Jelly. 



f pound of macaroni. 

1 quart of milk. 

3 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of butter. 

3 eggs. 

Salt, vanilla or nutmeg. 

Keep out a cup of milk to beat up with the eggs. 
Make same as macaroni pudding preceding. Bake 
in a pan, to be about an inch deep when done. Out 
in strips, squares, or diamonds and serve with red 
fruit jelly. 



450. Baked Vermicelli Pudding. 

The quality of vermicelli varies so much that no 
rule will serve tor all the sorts. Vermicelli ought to 
be parboiled and drained before being used fur this 
purpose Some, however, will dissolve to a paste as 
soon as hot water touches it. 

The same ingredients and proportions named or 
macaroni pudding serve for vermicelli. 

Boil a small piece of stick cinnamon in the milk i i 
lieu of other flavoring. Break the vermicelli rather 
small before cooking. Do not etir it except by shak- 
ing up with a furk. Always drop both vermic:l i 
and macaroni into milk or water that is boiling 
a-r.ady. 



Italian paste puddings, like everything else may 
have their day, but other pieces can be put upon the 
boards which will have a much more extensive run, 
especially when presented in a spirite 1 manner, like 
the following with brandy or wine sauce. 



451. Baked Sponge Pudding. 



This is simply hot cake with sauce, and may be th^ 
regular sponge cake mixture, but the following is 
easier, cheaper, and answers equally as well. 

1 pound of sugar. 
10 eggs. 

^ pound of butter me' ted 
^ pint of tepid milk. 
1^ pounds of flour. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Beat the sugar and eggs in a kettle as if making 
sponge cake, but t wo or three minutes will do. Then 
add the other ingredients, the powder just before the 
flour; beat up well, bake in shallow baVirg jans 
greased and floured, with granulated sugar sifted 
over the top before putting in the oven. The cake 
rises considerably and should be only half an inch 
deep when put in the pans. It should be baked of 
a very light color, and have a handsome g azed ap- 
pearance. Cut out in squares. Picnty of sauce is 
required. A suitable article to make on short 
notice, and may be varied by having raisius, etc., 
mixed in. 

The next is cottage pudding. It is supposed that 
in pastoral days it was called }ove-in a-cottage pud- 
ding, because a very fashionable belle said she saw a 
love of a pudding in the cottage where she stayed 
till the shower was over. But as love in a cottage 
went out of fashion, and it came to be love in a grand 
hotel with a suite of rooms and all the modern con- 
veniences the poor pudding lost half its title and 
remains as follows: 

45». 

Cottage Pudding with Barberry Vin- 
egar. 

A flour compound midway between cake and bat- 
ter pudding. 
^ pound of sugar. 
I pound of butter. 
6 eggs. 

1 pint of milk. 
Impounds of flour. 

3 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 
Level teaspoonful of sa't. 

Make up like pound cake, by creaming the sugar 
and butter together, adding the eggs two at a time, 
the milk and then the flour with powder and salt. 
Bake either m cake moulds and s ice like pound 
pudding, or else in a baking pan, shallow, to be cut 
in squares. Takes from twenty to forty minutes. 
Lemon syrup sauce is a good substitute for rasberry 
vinegar. 



Rasberry vinegar is a favorite sauce with the 
English for all sorts of flour and egg puddings and 
pancakes. Directions for making it will be found ai 
the end of this book.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



From this time forth stem duty requires us to stay 
at home and deal only in American productions. In 
this little private exposition as many foreign coun - 
tries have been represented as small expositions 
generally can boast of. The space allott d Great 
Britain was necessarily the largest, but France was 
Dot far behind, albeit very few French flags were set 
to mark the nation* ily of the goods. One country 
is entirely unrepresented, that is Central Africa; 
yet it is not the f ult of the culinary commissioners, 
but of the country itself. A careful examination of 
the books of Stanley's explorations ends fruitlessly. 
It appears p'ainly that the interior of Africa, or the 
African's interior — and if there is any diflFerence in 
the terms whichever is right wi 1 do — is altogether 
unacquainted with pudding. 45^ 

There is one nice pudding material which might, 
perhaps have been placed in the rice department of 
the Lower Nile but has been excluded through a 
prejudice against the label on the packages, which s 
• picture of "natives manufacturing manioca," and 
looks too much like "natives gathering chow chow 
leaves for Doctor Helmbold's extract of chow 
chow." Manioca makes pudding quite equal to 
rice. Pound some rice in a mortar, sift out the 
coarse, sift out the flour, use the middle, sago-like 
grains and you will not know it from manioca. The 
farina or rice pudding receipts will do for it. 

China makes a fair showing if rice, yams, and 
birdsnestcbe credited to her. The East , Indies 
has only one article, sago pudding, but that is quite 
impor ant in its relation to this country. 

Every reader who will recall to mind the first 
American Indian romance he ever read will recol 
lect how they always used to greet each other with 
"Sago, sago, great chief!" Sago is the pith of a 
tree; and that is why the Indians got such a repu- 
tation lor short and pithy sentences. But there is 
more in it than thac, "Where did the Indians come 
from?" is a question never yet satisfactorily ans 
wered, notwithstanding the attempts to prove them 
the lost ten tribes, and floaters across Behring's 
Straits. The word sago, it is seen, is in spontan- 
eous use among them. Saco, sachem, saguache, 
saguiam etsego, (which the English used to pro- 
nounce hot-sago) and other words, all meaning 
places where they have something to eat are but 
corruptions or deviations from the same root. Sago 
is Asiatic. The sago tree which yields the ed ble 
pith is native in the East Indian islands. Our 
Indians must have brought sago with them from 
that country. Now if the anthropological or some 
other sultab'e society wou^d follow up this matter, 
perhaps tbey would be able to prove that our 
Indians came from the land of sago in the East 
Indian Archioelago, and thus settle a much mooted 
question. 

Our Indians have never been accused of stupidity, 
but have often shown themselves to be true Ameri 



cans by their ready appreciation of a good thing 
when they had it. They had not been long in this 
country before they found out that American Indian 
corn was far better than East Indian sago, and so 
p'eased were they with the discove-y that — as is 
proven by Catlin's magnificent work on the North 
American Indians, and by the writirgs of all the 
poets and novelists from Longfellow down who have 
drawn their particulars from that source — they 
instituted a green corn dance to take place yearly 
upon the first appearance of the succu'ent roasting- 
ears of which the following pudding is made: 



454. 

American Green Corn Pudding. 



Tuscarora Puddinjr. 



A "vegetable entree" or entremet. 
3 pounds of green corn. 
6 ounces of fresh butter. 

1 rounded teaspoonful of salt. 
^ teaspoonful of white pepper. 

2 eggs and 8 yolks, (or 6 eggs.) 
1 quart of milk. 

Use tender roasting-ears. Free them carefully 
from silk. Shave the corn from the cob with a sharp 
knife till you have the required amount — nearly two 
quarts. Melt the butter and stir it in, and the 
seasonings. Beat the eggs and milk together; mix 
all; bake in a four quart milk pan about half an 
hour or till just set in the middle. 

465. 

Individual Green Corn Pudding. 



Make tulip-shaped cups of the lower part of the 
green corn husks, the stem being cut ofi'cose and 
the top edges ci't rounded with a pair of shears. 
Dip the cups in hot, clear butter. Place them in 
gem pans of suitable size, fill with the orn pud- 
ding preceding and bake in a slow oven from 10 to 
15 minutes without burning the husks out of color. 
When set lift the puddings out of the gem or muf- 
fin-pans and serve in the husks hot. 



As the green corn season is short, canned corn has 
to do duty for it most of the year. 

Two cans of the so called two-pound size will 
make the preceding amount That is if the honest 
canned corn be used, which is solid and has to be 
dug out with a spoon. When your house "gets 
stuck," on the fraudulent corn and-water put up by 
the firm that dyes mulberries with logwood, for 
blackberries, and cans the logwood chips too, then 
use four cans instead of two; drain it as dry as 
possible and mash it to a partial paste, to imitate the 
shaved green corn.

Boil the milk with the sugar in it ; sprinVle in 
the meal and stir it over the fire 5 minutes. Add 
the other ingredients. Tie up in a bag with room 
enough to swell to nearly twice its bulk; boil 6 
hours.

A book is advertised which foretells all the disas- 
ters that will befall this poor earth in the next seven 



years. Also, at the same time, Scribner's publishes 
an article presaging to hotel people the calamity of 
an avalanche of dried peaches. Now, wbat have we 
done ? It may be all very true abvUt the Delaware 
plains being " the peach garden of the continent, 
where the peach trees stand in rows a mi'e long, 
luxuriating in a warm and mellow soil and a genial 
cHmate, and every farm counts its hundreds or 
thousands. There are forests of twenty thousand 
peach-trees standing in prim and stately lines. 
Some large estates count ten, fificen, or twenty 
thousand trees in one block. With a fair crop 
there will be five million baskets of peaches on these 
trees. A good crop will yield six million baskets — 
more peaches than the nation can eat while they are 
in good condition " That is p'easant ; so is this: 
"when, in April days, the blossoms of these million 
tree i foretoken an abundant crop, the good new^s is 
telegraphed over the country." Yes, it is good news; 
everybody glories in millions ; we all love plenty. 
It is the conclusion that makes us unhappy. There 
is a new industry springing up. They have learned 
how to dry millions of baskets as peaches as easy as 
rolling off a log, as if there was not too many dried 
peaches already. The dried peach is a g od thing 
abstractly considered, yet, when presented in a 
practical shape to the hotel guest, a little of it goes 
quite a long way. The taste for it has to be culti- 
vated, and it is tedious work for the coo'-s. Dried 
peaches keep well, but it does hotel people no par- 
ticular good to keep them. They might pay the 
Indians their annuities, perhaps, in dried peaches, 
and get rid of the Delaware surplus in that way. 
If it will do any good towards checking the growing 
evil to show how to use up peaches, green or canned, 
here are a few ways to go on with, and some more 
may be studied up after awhile. 

460. Delaware Peach Puddinaf. 

A pastry bottom, peach pudding filling, and mer- 
ingue on top. 

1 quart of ripe peach pulp. 
4 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
^ pound of sugar. 

A dozen peach kernels pounded small. 

8 yolks of eggs. 

1 small cup of cream, 

^ cup of peach brandy (optional.) 

Take ripe peeled peaches and mash with the Dack 
of a spoon enough to make a heaping quart. Set it 
to stew in a bright saucepan with the butter and 
peach kernels in it ; mix the starch and sugar to- 
gether dry, stir them into the peach, and in about 2 
minutes remove the mixture from the fire. Be t in 
the yolks and cream and brandy. Line two shallow 
milk-pans with common pie paste, pour in the pud- 
ding to be about 1 J inches deep. Bake 20 minutes

of sugar. Canned peaches will do if drained from 
theirjuice. When stirred over the fire with butter 
good peaches turn creamy yellow and remain so. 

401. Delaware Peach Meringue. 



Line two suitable shallow pudding-pans with pie 
paste and fill in three inches deep with halves of 
ripe peeled peaches. Strew over them about ^ pound 
of white sugir to each pan (or half the weight of the 
peaches in sugar) and ^ pound of best butter. 
Orate a little nutmeg over. Bake in a 
slow oven abjut half an hour, with paper over 
if in danger of blackening the fruit. There should 
be a thick, rich syrup of the peach juice and sugar 
in the pans and the fruit transparent. Spread mer- 
ingue ever while still in the oven, and dry-bake that 
to a light fawn color. Serve either hot or cold 

Not only in Delaware but in Maryland, Virginia, 
Tennessee, and we know not how many peach 
growing states beside, the kind of pie to be next 
described is called peach cobbler. Perhaps it 
would be as good by some other name, but being 
such a good medium for disposing of too plentiful 
fruit its familiar name that it can be readily called 
by had best not be tampered with The French 
name is D'Artois — D' Artois of peaches or cherries, 
etc , or D'Artois cake Ihere is a province of 
Artois in France which possibly may be as great a 
peach country as little Delaware. But the proba 
bility is that D'Artois of fruit gained its name from 
a Count D'Artois, who, they do say, was some akin 
to Marie Antoinette. The English would scorn to 
call a peach cobbler anything but a peach pie, 
but as they cannot grow millions of baskets of 
peaches — only a few on a warm south wall — they 
are not good authority on the subject. Lihe apple 
and peach charlottes, cobblers are good either in 
place of pudding or as sweet entrees. 

463. 

Peach Cobbler Southern Style. 



D'Artois de Peches. 



A large pie baked in a shallow baking pan, from 
1 to 2J inches in depth, with bottom and top crust, 
glazed and sugared on top and cut out in square or 
triangular pieces. 

Fine pufiF paste is too rich for this purpose. Ordi- 
nary flaky pie paste made with 10 or 12 ounces of 
butter to a pound of flour is best. Cover the bottom 
of the pan with a sheet of paste rolled quite th n. 
Fill in with ripe peeled peaches, strew over them 
half their weight of sugar and a very little nutmeg. 
Cover with another thin sheet of paste and bake 
about I hour. When half done brush over the top 
with egg and water and strew granulated sugar 
over. Put back and bake it to a rich color. When 
the fruit is too dry to make its own syrup make a 



sauce to go with the cobbler. All sorts of fruit and 
rhubarb can be used this way. Canned fruit should 
be stewed down till the juice becomes thick before 
being put iuo the paste lined pan.

New Orleans Banana Puddings. 



Jamaica SoufiQes. 

PufiF puddings baked in candied orange rinds. 

When oranges are used for jelly, sherbets, etc , 
save the rinds to form the cups or cases for this pur- 
pose. They can be cut as melons are cut, to make 
ornamental edges, or else the entire peel removed by 
being slit part way down, can be turned back to 
form shapes like tiger-lilies. Boil the rinds in sev- 
eral waters till tender, and the butter taste is all ex- 
tracted; then boil in thick sugar syrup; drain, roll 
in sugar and set them to dry in the shape required 
(ill wanted. 

2 pounds of banana pulp. 

f pound of best butter (or, olive oil with salt.) 

^ pound of sugar. 

16 eggs, less four whites left out. 

\ pint of brandy. 

^ teaspoonful of ground mace. 

Place the two pounds of mashed banana in a 
bright saucepan with the butter, sugar, mace and 
eight yolkg of eggs, and stir them over the fire till 
cooked to a sort of a marmalade, cool it, add the 
other eight yolks raw, then the brandy and beat 
thoroughly; then mix in the twelve whites whipped 
to a firm froth. Bake in the orange cups on a but- 
tered pan, in a slow oven about ten minutes. Pow- 
dered sugar flavored with vanilla on top. Serve as 
soon as done The rinds if skillfully candied with- 
out being made hard are a pleasant confection. 



It is difficult to make anything of almonds as 
good as it ought to be without a marb.e mortar and 
pestle to pound them to a paste in. 

If your house does not own one, a porcelain 
potato-masher and small deep kette may have to do 
for a substitute.

them — in a mortar a few at a time till all are re- 
duced to a paste at least as fine as farina. Moisten

as you proceed with the rose water to prevent 
oiling. Boil the sugar and water a few minutes to 
form a strong syrup. Throw in the butter, then 
the almond paste, then six yolks of eggs and stir 
till it cooks thick — about five minutes. Take it off, 
add the six remaining yolks raw and beat up well. 
Then the twelve whites whipped firm. Bake in cups 
or cases. 

Two ounces of starch added to the syrup along 
with the almond paste will make taller puddings 
when souflEles are wanted. 



Every one thus far has been a week-day pudding, 
that is to say, a hot pudding. Now a few are 
needed of another class. It does not seem to be 
quite well enough known that fashion has decreed 
it to be vulgar to eat hot pudding on Sunday, ex- 
cept at a railroad eating house, and it is vulgar even 
there when the pudding is very hot and there is only 
ten minutes for dinner. The railroad companies do 
their part to guard the public against getting into 
such a predicament by running few or no trains on 
Sundays. The various journals of civilization never 
mention this new decree of fashion in their articles 
on tab'e manners for the obvious reason that 
they cater only to the intellectual wants of 
first-class people who are already thor 
oughly informed. It would be very awkward 
for those journals to go about advising people not to 
eat hot pudding on Sunday who never do. It may 
be a little absurd to mention such a thing, but the 
cooks, and particularly those employed in hotels, 
are quite glad that hot Sabbath pudding is no longer 
countenanced by the best people. The change lets 
them out a little, and the result has not been, as 
some imagined, an overcrowding of the churches; 
many of those released professing to be well enough 
pleased with Strauss and Chopin, Verdi and Beeth 
oven in a so-called beer-garden Some talk about 
Whitfcier's bro ider fiith and Bryant's idea of the 
woods being God's first temples, and Byron's pleas- 
ure in the pathless woods and rapture on the lonely 
shore, or something of the sort. At any rate it is 
said they do better and more careful work and show 
more natural energy and less pernicious stimula- 
tion after the rest afforded through the abolition of 
hot Sabbath pudding. What, then, shall there be 
no more pudding after church? Yes, certainly 
there shall be puddings plenty and of the most 
delicate and delicious descriptions but they are not 
good unless quite cold. 

405. 

Chocolate Custard Meringue. 



2 quarts of rich milk, 
f pound of sugar. 

3 ounces common chocolate grated. 
16 eggs 

2 tablespoonfuls of vanilla extract. 



Boil the sugar and grafed chocolate in half the 
milk and beat till the chocolate is well dis- 
solved. Separate the eggs so as to get ten or 
twelve whites for the meringue. Beat the rest of 
the eggs and yolks into the remaining quart of cold 
milk, pour the chocolate milk into it; flavor, bake 
in a four quart milk-pan or dish about twenty min- 
utes. Custards are curdled and made watery by too 
long baking. As soon as fairly set in the middle 
have the meringue made as directed in manj pre- 
vious cases, ready to spread over the top while stih 
hot and baking. Sift sugar over it and bake about 
ten minutes with the oven door open. To be eaten 
cold, A very handsome and excellent dish when 
carefully baked. 



The above may be cooked and served in custard 
cups as well. The annexed directions for this will 
apply equally to several succeeding varieties.

Prepare the custard preceding with the best 
French chocolate and useless vanilla extract. Puur 
the custard in cups, place them in a steamer and 
steam fifteen minutes, taking care they do not be- 
come cooked enough to curdle. Pile the meringue 
on top while they are still hot, set the cups in a 
baking pan and bake the tops very sMghtly. They 
may also be cooked by setting in a pan cf water in 
the oven, but with more injury to the cups than by 
steaming 



In a guessing class when it comes to guessing 
flavors, they always slip up in trying to guess what 
gives caramel creams and custards such a pleasant 
taste. 

46T. 

Caramel Custard Meringue. 



2 quarts of milk, or part cream. 

f pound of sugar. 

18 eggs. 

2 teaspoonfuls of almond extract. 

Four ounces of the sugar is to make the caramel, 
which must not be black like that used for coloring 
Put the sugar in a little brass kettle and set it on 
the fire without water. It will melt and turn brown. 
When it looks like golden syrup pour in a quart of 
the milk and let boil till the caramel is dissolved. 

Separate enough of the eggs io get out ten or 
twelve whites for the meringue Beat the others 
into the remaining quart of milk, add the sugar and 
flavor, mix in the caramel milk and bake till barely 
set in the middle. If not wanted meringued use 
fewer eggs. It is less necessary io meringue this 
than chocolate custard, which does not look well 
without.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY CQOK. 



We have had charlottes and apple cakes hot and 
variously made; the next is of the sort of articles 
that are better than they look. It is rich enough to 
be eaten cold. 

468. Maryland Apple Cake. 

2 heaping quarts of apples in quarters. 

f pound of sugar — more with soUr apples. 

f pound of best fresh butter. 

2 teaspoonfuls of ground cinnamon. 

2 pounds of sweet paste for the crust. 

For the last named article, ' home folks" use com- 
mon cookie dough, hotel cooks use sweet tart paste 
because it is easier to bake without burning. 

Break the butter in bits in two frying-pans, set 
on the range, and when melted put in the apples 
(pared and cored of course) and fry them slowly 
and carefully till done. Put in the sugar and 
ground cinnamon and cook a little longer. The 
apples are expected to look brown. 

Butter a baking-paA and lioe it with the sweet 
paste rolled out thin; put in the apples and cover 
with a thin crust. Bake as long as you can with- 
out scorching — about three-quarters of an hour. 
Turn the cake out, upside down on a board or sheet 
of tin and cut it in blocks or squares to serve 
Thick cream cold is the best sauce. 



Common cookie dough for the preceding is made 
with: 

^ pound of sugar. 

} pound of butter. 

3 eggs. 

^ cupful of milk. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

And 1 pound of flour. 



Sweet tart paste is halfway between cake and pie- 
paste and better than common paste for apple-cake 
and many other articles, such as shell pies to be 
baked the day before and filled with preserves. 



469. 



Sweet Tart Paste. 



1 pound of flour. 

6 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces of powdered sugar. 
2 eggs. 

^ cupful of water, 

Rub the butter thoroughly into the flour dry. 
Allow a little salt if not enough in the butter. 
Break the eggs in the middle, add the sugar and 
water, mix up and knead smooth. 



4TO. 



Plain Baked Custard. 



2 quarts of milk or cream. 

^ pound of sugar. 

24 yolks of eggs, or 16 whole. 

2 tablespoonfuls of vanilla or lemon. 



Beat the sugar and eggs together; pour in the milk 
and extract. Bake in a shallow pan about twenty 
or thirty minutes. 

The preceding is everybody's acquaintance and 
for a cold pudding is excellent without sauce or any 
other addition. When it turns watery it i3 because 
of too much baking. But when it is de*ired to add to 
it some of our abundant fruits, which would har- 
monize with it so well, an unpleasant state of fluidity 
results in spite of careful baking. Then the cooks 
say it is the fault of water in the milk, and blame 
the cows for going and standing in the river, as they 
are known to do, soaking themselves through and 
through for hours at a time. The difficulty can 
be overcome and a nice line of fruit custards made 
in the following way. 

4T1. 

Ne"W Providence Pineapple Custard. 

1 quart of cream. 
^ pound of sugar, 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
10 yolks of eggs. 

I pound of pineapple. 

A small cup of milk to mix the starch. 

A pinch of salt. 

Cut the pineapple in small dice, and if not quite 
ripe and sweet stew it in some syrup formed by cov- 
ering it with white sugar. 

Boil the cream with the half pound of sugar in it. 
Mix the starch with the cup of mil's; pour the boil- 
ing cream to that, causing it to thicken without be- 
ing quite cooked; beat the yolks and stir in, and 
then the pineapple. Bake. 



47S. California Cherry Custard. 



Make a thick compote of white cherries by stew- 
ing two quarts, pitted, with f pound of sugar and 
half cup of water till the juice is reduced to thick 
syrup. Spread this in a thick layer over the bot- 
tom of a four-quart pan. Make the custard accord- 
ing to the receipt preceding, pour it over the ch rries 
and bake as usual. To dish up place a spoonful of 
cream in the ice-cream saucer and a neat spoonful of 
the cherry custard in that. 

473. Virginia Cherry Custard. 

With red morello, or black cherries. Butter the 
bottom of a four-quart milk-pan, place in it two 
quarts of pitted cherries and their juice and one 
pound of sugar and bake in a slow oven till the 
cherries will adhere to the pan and not mix with 
the custard. Make a plain egg custard of one 
quart of milk and 12 yolks and four ounces of 
sugar, pour on top of the cherries and bake. 
Serve cold with cream.

ADDENDA. 



Queen Mab's pudding it is not unlikely may have 
been the predecessor of well-known charlotte russe 
The writer remembers first seeing the name in a 
little cook-book by a titled lady, that must have 
been published half a century ago. It has since 
reappeared in many places. Queen Mab's pud 
ding, is a charlotte made by lining a mould with 
lady-fingers striped with red jelly, and filling with 
the gelatine cream that is variously called lemon 
cream, velvet cream, {creme veloute), jaune-mange, 
and perhaps others names. It is not the purpose 
here to enter into the methods and merits of gela 
tine creams, and a short course will be taken with 
this:

red currant jelly and place by twos together, then 
cut them lengthwise into stripes and line custard 
cups with these so^that there will be red and yellow 
stripes all round for the outside They may be 
kept in position by slightly wetting the edges of the 
cake in white of egg. It is well enough for pre- 
caution to wipe out the cups first with a touch cf 
olive oil. 

For the filling make a rich boiled custard. To 
each quart allow an ounce of gelatine, (it used to be 
isinglass), dissolved in water separate, or beaten in 
the milk while on the fire, which is the shorter way. 



Favor with lemon. Strain. When cold and so 
nearly set that the cakes cannot rise and float in it 
pour this lemon cream into the lined cups, set on 
ice and turn them out when firm. May be orna- 
mented on top with jelly and whipped cream around 
in the saucers. 



Corrections. 



The bread custard receipt, and a few others like 
it near the beginning of this book should have 
been written, two slightly pressed quarts of bread 
crumbs, instead of pressed in or full-pressed. 
While a loose quart of bread crumbs has sc;ircly 
any weight it is found on the other hand that 
pastry cooks coming down on it with a pressure of 
fifty pounds to the square inch make much more of 
a cake and much less of a custard than the writer 
does of the same receipt. 

Also the few people who know how to cook rice 
dry, as it ought to be, will probably find the rice 
custard pudding requires in their hands about a 
pint more milk. 

Use less baking-powder than is directed for Cot- 
tage Pudding. The amount there specified is 
enough for twice the quantity. See variations and 
adulterations of baking-powder in Book of Breads 



There has been a painstaking effort throughout 
this entire series to make each and every receipt so 
reliable that any person might choose among them 
with a reasonable certainty of success as complete 
on the first trial as at any subsequent time. 



4T7. "Home-Made" Pudding Sauce, or 
Sugar Dip. 

1 cupful of brown sugar. 

1 cupful of hot water. 

J cupful of butter. 

1 tablespoonful of flour. 

Mix flour and sugar together dry, pour the water 
to them, add the butter, and stir over the fire till it 
boils. The sauce should be thick.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



Simple Syrup Pudding Sauce. 



4TT. 

2 pounds of granulated sugar. 

1 pint of water. 

Boil them together in a clean, bright kettle, or 
new tin pan. Skim and strain for use. 

The above is often used p'ain and unflavored as 
Bauce for steamed pudding, pancakes, frijtters, pud- 
dings of green fruit, etc. 

478. Wine Sauce for Puddings. 



2 pounds of granulated sugar. 

1 teacupful of water, 

1 pint of wine. 

1 dozen whole cloves. 

^ a lemon. 

1 blade of mace. 

Melt the sugar in the cup of water on the fire 
taking care it does not burn while dissolving. Throw 
in the spices and the lemon cut in bits — the seeds 
excluded — and let simmer to draw the flavors. 
Remove from the fire and add the wine, then strain. 
It should not boil after the wine is added. 



The foregoing is not quite a simple matter, or one 
for set instructions. Color is desirable in most cases 
and the wine is not always sufficient. Then ar- 
tificial means must be employed. The wines of Cal- 
ifornia are, happily, coming into use cheap enough 
for such purposes as these, and with the probabilities 
in favor of their purity. They are not always of 
desirable color. Burnt sugar caramel will make 
your sauce sherry or madeira color. Carmine, which 
is the coloring principal of cochineal, will make a 
handsome claret color, 'provided there be lemon 
juice or any acid in the sauce, otherwise it is apt to 
make an unpleasant purple. Caramel and carmine 
mixed make port wine color ; but let the tints be 
weak rather than be overdone. 

Pudding sauces could perhaps be classified in four 
divisions, but they ought not, because it may almost 
be said the more unmethodical our methods in this 
line can be the better. Not of course, the methods 
of making sauces, but of their application. This 
matter, almost inexplicable, it will be our task to 
talk at and around about in a succeeding column. 

The sauces at present touched upon it will be 
observed have had nothing in them to give body to 
their linked sweetness but pure sugar and for richness 
only wine. So when more wine is used or when 
fruit or fruit juice instead, more sugar has to be 
added for thickening for sweetened water or liquor 
is not desirable for anything but a French beverage 
They tell of a notable Frenchman who was so de- 
lighted when loaf sugar was first made that he 
declared when the price got down to two francs per 



pound he would drink nothing but sugar-and- 
water. Surely sod i-fou mains and raspberry and 
pineapple syrups had never then been thought of 
else why such a homely fancy? 



4T9. 

Pineapple or 



Raspberry Sauce for 
Puddings. 



2 pounds of sugar. 

J pint of pineapple juice or syrup made by steep- 
ing the slices, or of liquor from the cans. 

^ pound of pineapple in shreds 

J pint of port or claret wine. 

Dissolve the sugar in the pineapple juice. Bring 
to a boil, strain, then add the wine and pineapple, 
keep hot without boiling. 

Instead of the wine h?ilf a pint of water and a 
few drops of red coloring — to m*ke the sauce pink 
only — can be used. 



Red raspberries can be used in the place of pine- 
apple with the diflference that the berries should be 
dropped singly into the boiling syrup while it is still 
thick and never be stirred. In this way they retain 
their proper shape while coloring and flavoring the 
syrup. No wine needed. 

Very handsome sauces of other kinds of fruit are 
made in the way above indicated, by adding it to a 
strong syrup made with ha'f fruit juice aud half 
water. White sweet grapes which furnish no syrup 
may be used to advantage thrown whole into boiling 
wine sauce. 



480. 



Lemon Syrup Sauce. 



2J pounds of sugar. 

3 lemons. 

1 pint of water. 

Grate the rinds of the lemons on a tin grater and 
scrape the zest with a fork into the sugar. Squeeze 
the juice in without the seeds Add water, boil up 
and pass through a fine strainer. One of the best 
sauces for pancakes and, if made a little less acid, 
for tapioca and all farinaceous and cake puddings. 

481. Orange Syrup Sauce. 



2 pounds of sugar. 

2 oranges. 

1 lemon. 

IJ cups of water. 

Make same as lemon syrup. 

The sauce preceding mixed with one third curacao 
is the proper sauce for Savarin pudding, to be 
poured into the pudding or cake hot.

Curacao is a cordial made by steeping orange peel 
in proof spirit and then adding to the flavored spirit 
three times as much simp'e syrup. It is brandy 
colored. As a substitute make the clear syrup 
sauce, the first of this series with a few cloves and 
some orange peel grated in it. Boil, strain and add 
half pint or less of good brandy. 



483. 



Maraschino Sauce. 



Sauce au Marasquin. 



Maraschino is made by steeping blac'i cherry

flavored spirit three times as much simp'e syrup 
It is c'earaod colorless for a substitute make the sim- 
ple syrup wiih the juice of canned white cherries — a 
pint to two pounds. Strain, flavor slightly with peach 
or almond extract, and add a quarter pint of gia. Ex 
cellent for steamed puddings, rice and farina cat es 
and fried cream fritters. 



As long as butter and honey, silver drips and 
map'e syrup are applied in such lavish proportions 
to ho' el waffles, hot breads and cakes as is the 
present custom there will be no reason to make 
excuse for the excessive sweetness of these clear 
syrup sauces. Rich as they are they can go a degree 
higher for such things as sponge puddings and 
boiled puddings of flour.

1 tablespoonful of whole spices — consistiug of

Boil all together ten minutes — the lemon cut in 
pieces — then strain through a fine strainer. The 
j nice of the lemon is essential to brighten the color 

of the sauce, 

485. Raisin Sauce. 



For macaroni puddings and timhales make a sauce

1 pound of powdered sugar. 

8 ounces of butter, (large cup). 

^ cupful hot water. 

J cupful of brandy, or else nearly J pint of wine 
and no water. 

Warm the butter slightly in a bright pan, put the 
sugar with it and cream them by rubbing together 
as if for cake. Then set it on the range and while 
beating with an egg-whisk in one hand pour in the 
brandy and water or wine with the other. When 
hot enough to s^rve it is ready. It must not boil, as 
that destroys its silvery whiteness and makes a gray 
syrup of it. Takes but a few minutes and should be 
made last thing. Good for souffle puddings of fruit, 
drop dumplings and boibd puddings. 



488. 



Maple Syrup Sauce.

Golden syrup made hot, two ounces of butter to

Olace, ice, glace, glass, g^aze, gloss; glacS, iced,

That is all very slippery. When a biil-of-fare in- 
stead of saying a dish has a sauce describes it as 
glac4 the glossy sauce is required to be thick 
enough to coat the article and barely run enough to 
sett e down smooth. With all sugar sauces lite the 
list preceding it is hardly practicable— they would be 
almost candy. The next sett are better for gloss.

to the boiling lemon water and let boil 6 minutes. 
Then beat in the butter and add the wine. Strain

Sauce Millefleurs. 



1 pound of sugar. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 
1 pint of water. 

1 pint of thick sweet cream. 

J cup of red fruit syrup. 

Various flavorings. 

The making of this sauce will be best understood 
by the explanation that it is a pearly cream sauce 
with a mixture of several agreable flavors. It should 
be pearl pink. Of old, when the spices, almonds, 
lemon zest, and flavors of nectarine and peach h id to 
be prepared separately this sauce .became a serious 
affair. Now, by boiling cinnamon, c'oves and 
grated peel in the pint ot water, btirriug in the 
sugar and starch, then the cream, and j udiciously 
adding drops of various extracts the sauce can be 
made as good as need be in a few minutes. It must 
be strained, of course. 



49tS. Raspberry Vinegar Sauoe. 



Vinaigre Framboise. 



The various fruit vinegars used extensively for 
aauces and beverages in Europe are but little enquir- 
ed for in the United States, but probably need only 
to be better known to be appreciated. The native 
wild raspberry of the Rocky Mountains, with its 
peculiar aromatic flavor and bright scarlet color and 
juice doubtless cantains new possibilities in relishes 
and confections, and could be cultivated to an unlim 
ited extent among its native barrens. During is 
short season in the towns about which it grows it has 
no rival among fruits and brings a higher price than 
any other. 

To make raspberry vinegar, ha-f fill a stone jar 
with ripe raspberries of any kind, and pour in pure 
cider vinegar enough to a little more than cover 
them. Let stand in a warm place twenty-four 
hours. Mash the berries in the jar; strain and 
press through a cloth and then run the liquor 
through the flannel jelly bag. To each pint allow a 
pound of sugar if for present use or two pounds if 
to be bottled. Boil and skim and it is ready for use 
when made cold. It can be kept in preserving jars 
or cans a long time, put up in the usual manner, or 
in stone jugs, sealed while hot and painted outside 
to exclude air 



**Mio amico, why do you, residing in the Boule- 
vard des Italiens, Pays Culinaire, yet writing French, 
caU that sambaoine which the French ca 1 sabayon, 
even when writing Fiench?" 

"Only because the French themselves call the same 
thing by two different names. The sauce or hot spirit- 
uous beverage is of Italian origin , and has come down 
from the time when Italian cookery was in the 
ascendent, but the Italian spelling is sambaojney the 
j being pronounced like i." 

Then I asked my meal-colored German elf what 
in his country they know about sabayon. He 
answered : "Why that is dreifutz\ — only" — he adds, 
"when made slightly different with wine it is 
schatto** 

Then I asked the great Columbian oracie and he, 
smilingly answered, * why that is scarcely different 
from Thomas and Jeremiah, — only we do not cook 
our tom-and-jerry quite so much as you cooks do." 

Then I went to an expert Englishman and asked 
him — "Say, Johnny! what is tbat sauce you make 
for plum pudding when you don' t have the common 
brandy sauce?" 

"That," says he, "is German Custard Sauce," 

"What is its French name?" 

"Sabayon." 

Enough said. They are distinctions without 
much difference. The confusion comes from the 
same compound being mentioned in a Babel of many 
tongues. If an intelligent person but learn the 
base he can build up as many variations as he please, 
himself. 

The base may be learned by boiling a quart of 
Rhine wine, throwing in sugar enough to pleasantly 
sweeten, and a little spice ; then stirring in enough 
beaten yolks to thicken it to a custard-like consis- 
tency — about 10 yolks to a quart — and taking off 
before it quite boils. Mulled wine, a hot beverage, 
is an elaboration of this, having the whites of the 
eggs beaten to a froth and stirred into the nearly 
boiling mixture the minute before serving.

Beat the yolks and sugar together in a deep sauce- 
pan as if making egg-nogg. Set the saucepan on the 
range ; stir in the wine a little at a time, and then 
with the egg-whisk whip the mixture to a froth till 
it has become hot and begins to thicken. It must 
not quite boil, and ought to be made only just be- 
fore it is needed. Either powdered cinnamon, vanilla, 
or extracts can be added for flavor. Brandy or rum 
mixed with the wine is generally considered an ia- 
provement.

Paper Cases for Individual 
Charlottes, 



jrrocure half a dozen sheets of cap or fine book 
paper, which is like writing paper not ruled, and 
make a pattern for the paper cases by fitting a band 
of paper to the outside of a very small tumbler, 
such as is used for Roman punch, or some similar 
small shape. The band of paper, when cut to fit, 
will form a curve. Cut as many such pieces as are 
needed from the sheets, and then, placing three or 
four together, cut both top and bottom edges into 
fringe a quarter of an inch or less in depth. Make 
some corn starch paste very stiff, and paste the ends 
of the bands together, forming cup shapes, then cut 
around the edges, press the fringe bottom edges of 
the cups on to the paste, the fringe bent outward, 
and the shapes are made. 



503. Strawberry Charlottes in Cases 
'or Fifty. 

Having prepared 50 paper cases of about the 
capacity of very small tumblers, according to the 
directions in the preceding article; next bake 6 
sheets of cake of any kind that is suitable to roll up, 
or of the following, which is right in quantity for 50 
small charlottes. 

3 rounded cupfuls of granulated sugar — 1^ 
pounds. 

15 eggs. 

i cup of water. 

4 rounded cupfuls of flour — 18 ounces. 
Separate the eggs. Beat the yolks, sugar and 

water rapidly for ten minutes. 

Have the flour weighed or measured ready 
Whip the whites perfectly firm. Stir the flour into 
the beaten yolks, and the whipped whites last. 

Spread thinly on sheets of blank paper not 
greased, and bake in a quick oven about 6 minutes. 

Careful baking is required, because if dried or 
burnt the cake will break. 

Brush the paper, under side, with water, and it 
can be pulled off the cake. Should any of the sheets 
become too dry to roll or bend in spite of care in 
baking, lay them on top of each other after wetting 
the paper, and let lie so half an hour. 

Cut out the pieces of cake by the same paper pat- 
tern the shapes were cut by, but a trifle shorter, and 
put the lining of cake in the paper cases. No 
bottom of cake is needed, but little square pieces 
can be pushed down inside if wished. 

A short time before serving fill the charlottes with 
the cream intended for the purpose. 



504. Strawberry Whipped Cream for 
Fifty. 

1 quart of red strawberries. 
3 pints of thick sweet cream. 
1 pound of sugar — 2 cupfuls. 
IJ ounces of gelatine — a package. 



Cover the fruit with the sugar in a bowl, mash 
together and rub through a seive. 

Dissolve the gelatine in a cup of milk extra, in a 
small vessel set in a place where it will warm gradu- 
ally. When the gelatine is dissolved put the cream 
into a pail or pan, take the large wire egg whisk and 
whip it to a froth, pour in the gelatine, and continue 
whipping, with the pan set on ice; then add the 
strawberry pulp or syrup, and when it is firm 
enough, and before it is quite set, fill the individual 
charlottes with it, well piled above the edge 

Cream without fruit, and only flavored with 
strawbeiry extract, does not need any gelatine. 



505. 



Peaches and Cream. 



The harder kinds of peaches should be chopped to 
the size of strawberries and mixed with sugar two or 
three hours before the meal. Allow about four 
ounces of sugar to a quart. Soft peaches, after peel- 
ing, are best only quartered or sliced. If admissible, 
serve them in large glass bowls ornamented with 
quarters of red or yellow peaches placed in order 
and a pitcher of cream with each bowl separately. 
If served individually in saucers, pour the cream 
over only as they are dished up. 



506. 



Compote of Apples, 



This is but another term for apples stewed in 
syruf). A compote of fruit is understood to be dif- 
ferent from stewed fruit, in being richer with sugar 
and the fruit being either whole or in large pieces. 

Fine ripe apples of a kind that have proved to be 
good to cook make a delightful sweet dish for tea in 
this way: 

4 large apples. 

] cupful of sugar. 

i cupful of water. 

Piece of orange peel or lemon peel, or cloves, or 
stick cinnamon for flavoring. 

Put the sugar, orange peel and water on to boil in 
a deep saucepan. Pare the apples, cut each one in 
three and cut out the cores. Drop three or four 
pieces at a time into the boiling syrup, and let sim- 
mer about fifteen minutes, or until done and almost 
transparent ; take them out with a fork, and cook 
some more in the same syrup, and so on till all are 
done. Serve in dessert saucers. The apples can be 
colored pink by adding red fruit juice or currant 
jelly to the syrup. 

50T. Pineapple Sweet Salad. 

1 pineapple. • 

1 teacupful of powdered sugar 

^ cup of maraschino. 

Peel a pineapple, cut it into uniform slices and 
cover them with the sugar in a glass dish. Let it 
remain to form a syrup, and when to be served add 
the maraschino.

THE HOTEL BOOK OF BREADS. 



AH the Mystery that Pertains to Yeast 



511. 

Stout Party : "What deHcious bread you have 
Who is your baker?" 

Bnllat-Savarin : "Limet, ia Rue de Richelieu 
He supplies the royal family; but I send there be- 
cause it is near, and continue doing so because I 
have proclaimed him to be the first bread-maker in 
the world " 

Stout Party : "I must take a note of his address 
I am a great eater of bread, and with such ro Is as 
those I could almost dispense with everything else." 

It is one of the most natural occurences in the 
world, when traveling hotel patrons stop at a good 
hotel — no matter what the rate per day if situated 
in the midst of the land of sweet butter— and find 
on the table hot rolls that are remarkably light, well- 
baked, well-shaped, thin-crusted, soft, white, sweet, 
fine-grained, delicious and just splendid ; so that 
/ley think they "could almost dispense with every- 
thing else;" for them to ask somebody as a special 
favor to procure them the receipt to mal^e them by. 
But, more's the pity, they seldom derive any benefit 
from the reply; not only because the ingredients are 
but seldom weighed or measured, and the pastry 
cook may be unable and unwilling to supply the 
information, but because in the nature of the case 
the receipt is but a small part of a little system of 
bread-making that has to be faithfully followed from 
small beginnings to great results, if uniformly fine 
rolls and bread are to be produced ; and that little 
system is yet so large that it cannot be explained 
quite all in a minute. Happily however, bread-making 
is not a very complicated aflfair compared with other 
branches of cookery where each new article may 
require a diflferent method, but this ©nee learned 
becomes little more than a matter of routine. The 
first step is making the yeast. 



Oommon Yeast, or Baker's Ferment. 

512. 

About 24 potatoes. 

2 pounds of flour. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

1 quart of stock yeast. 

Wash the potatoes thoroughly, using a brush fV)r 
the purpose, and boil them in a kettle of water 
When done pour oflf what remains of the dark water 
and fill up again with fresh. When that boils turn 
out potatoes and boiling water on to the flour in a 
large pan and mash all to a smooth paste. Throw 
in the sugar. Thin down with ice water till like 
thick cream. Set the large colander over your 6- 
gallon stone jar (just fresh scalded out) and strain 
the yeast into it. When it is no more than about 
milk warm mix in the stock or other yeast to start 
it. Let stand in a moderately warm place, undis 
iorbed, for from 12 to 24 hours— according to 



weather, activity, and need of using It will then 
be ready for use, and should be kept cold. 

Not much in that ; yet it was once the subject of 
an English patent. Somewhere between 1825 and 
1835. And in the days of our daddies was kept a 
profound secret and termed patent yeast, London 
yeast, and patent London potato yeast, long after 
the patent had expired. Now it is used in almost 
every household where bread is made. 



To avoid sourness in this ferment it is quite 
tial that the flour be well scalded, which is the rea- 
son for filling up the kettle the second time to have 
plenty of boiling water to pour over it along with 
ihe potatoes. 



Ought not the potatoes be pared? 

Yts, they ought to be. In nice little hotels kept 
by ladies they are pared and the eyes scooped out. 
All the bakers wi 1 do that way when the millen- 
nium comes. At present the bakers have a sort of 
superstition that the potato skins make the yeast 
stronger, and if it should fail to be good would ba 
sure to lay the blame to the paring of the potatoes. 
However, they are obliged to wash them very clean, 
and if they did not pour oflf the first water they are 
boiled in, its blackness would injure their bread. 



There is no salt in the receipt. Ought not salt be 
added? 

It need not be. It seems about all the priva'e 
house authorities add salt. The baker's supersti- 
tions all are against it. Most bakers will not put 
salt in their first sponge. Salt in yeast probably 
does no harm; it certainly does no good. This little 
book teaches to make bread with such ease, certain- 
ty, and indiflference to trifles that you will be at 
liberty to do either way without impairing success. 



Not so with sugar. It has a chemical eflfect that 
is very observable. People can go on for years 
making good bread without, but they never discover 
how quicii and strong yeast can be until they try 
the sugar experiment. 

513. 

But there is stock yeast mentioned. Where are 

we to get that? 

By all means make your own if you have to make 
bread constantly and regularly, no matter ia what 
quantity, for stock can be made either by the barrel 
or bottleful, and needs be made only once a month, 
because stock is not put into bread direct, but only 
used to make the common yeast or ferment. 

It costs only the trouble of making, the materials 
being almost too trifling in expense to count. Of 
course you c-in shuflie along without. Some hotel 
pastry cooks do so all their lives, never knowing 
how to make stock. But then they are always de- 
pendent, begging from those who are unwilling to

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



fire or sell it. Or else t-hey use ferment to start 
with over and over again, and it carries the germs 
of acetio fermentation, or seeds of sourness all the 
time; it is weak and makes rotten dough, while 
with stook used to start with every time, or at least 
alternately, it is the most difficult thing to make 
dough or bread become sour, even if you were to 
try it. 

Some who go on using the lifeless ferment made 
with ferment for years, blaming the flour and the 
luck, are astonished after all to find yeast made with 
perfect stock turning out rolls and loaves twice as 
large and twice as good as ever they had known 
them before. 



Stock yeast is the foundation corner stone of a 
trade. The receipt for making it is never published. 
It is too valuable to be spread broadcast in a news- 
paper, yet some way will be indicated at the end of 
this book by which those who really need it my ob- 
tain the desired information. 



But if no stock yeast, what then? 

A quart or more of good ferment from the shop of 
a good baker is the best substitute. Next to that is 
dry hop yeast in cakes, (they are made from stock 
yeast) not good fi>r making bread direct because of 
their taste, perceptible to all persons critical about 
their bread, but good to start ferment along with 
sugar. Use a liberal amount — about 6 cakes to each 
gallon of ferment made. Make a new start that way 
about once a month and use ferment for starting at 
other times. 



There are no hops. Don't you use hops in mak- 
ing yeast? 

Yes, in all cases where no stock can be had, tie up 
4 ounces of hops in a piece of muslin, boil them 
with the potatoes in the second water, and press 
out the liquor through the colander when straining 
the yeast Hops are not needed>ith stock for 
starting, as that is already bitter with them. 



The baker or pastry cook who makes perfect 
yeast is naturally reluctant to take chances on other 
people's on making a new commencement, and will 
prefer to take along his own in the following easy 
and reliable manner. 



514. 



Dry Hop Yeast. 



1 pint of strong, thick, stock yeast. 
1 pint of fresh ferment, 
1 pound of corn meal. 

1 pound of flour. 

2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

By thick stock is meant some that is not watered 
down to the common point of using, but left with 
more consistence for this purpose. 

Mix all together to a stiflF dough, without knead- 



ing. Cut out in suitable cakes and dry them in a 
cool place as quickly as possible, turning over fre- 
quently. If covered with meal and dried under a 
slight pressure of board and weight till so much of 
the moisture is expelled that they cannot ferment, 
these cakes will be as free from breakage as the dry 
yeast of the stores. Either way they will be found 
very strong and ready both for bread or yeast 
making. 

615. 

A brand of dry yeast with a German name that is 

sold in tin-foil packages, is made as above with 
starch and flour. The starch absorbs more moist- 
ure — takes up more yeast. 

There are then several kinds of yeast. Of com- 
pressed yeast, the all in all and first necessity with 
many bakers, this little book will not have much to 
say. It is neither better nor worse than that we make 
ourselves Its one merit is that it saves the trouble 
of making either stock or ferment. In the largest 
hotels which have bakeries attached it is used and, 
saving labor, is as cheap as any. But it has to be 
purchased, and in the ordinary hote] and boarding 
house, after a month or two, the question invariably 
comes : 

•'Can't you make your own yeast? So and so 
does, and they have splendid bread." 

Then the cook or pastry makes his own, and 
rather liking the independence it gives him, and 
not caring to change methods every month, the prac- 
tice of using home-made yeast becomes the hotel 
rule. 

All ignorant imaginings of luck, chance, water- 
witchery, mystery, hidden knowledge, moon's age 
and the like having to do with fermentation should, 
one would think, have been banished long before 
this ; but such is not the case, as we are often re- 
niinded seeing how easily even some old hands will 
give up trying under the least stress of accident. 



Two men, a few months since, started a "French 
Bakery" — so their handsome new sign had it — in 
the livest new city on the continent. The capitalist, 
with five years savings of some plodding business; 
the other partner, a routine shop baker from an 
eastern city. Large size portable oven procured at 
great expense, very large tent, all other fixtures 
suitable, high hopes of course, scores of such begin- 
nings had become fine stores doing a rushing busi 
ness. First opening day bread very bad — gray 
color like rye — full of holes — rolls all run together 
shsipele^s, worse than bread. Blamed flour. Sent 
for the merchant author of their ruin. Merchant 
called referees, proved best flour in the state. Next 
day bread no better, could not be worse — blamed 
water, oven, dough trough, weather. Next day 
bread no better — blamed the luck, moon, planet, 
climate, salt. Ran to place of one of referees wher«

gloriuus bread was made and borrowed eome good 
yeast. 

Next day had good average baker's bread. But 
no m«re customers. All parties demoralized. Baker 
on a STool smoking said it was no use^his trying in 
that town any more, because he had made bis first 
yeast in the wrong quarter of the moon!^ Sold out 
for a song — capitalist raised enough to go back home 
with — baker lost. 



Another case. The steward of a good hotel where 
the finest bread was known to be made, was sought 
by the owner of a bakery that had been running 
with good Buccfss for some time. 

"What brand of flour do you use? I must get some 
or close my shop. I have no more gocd bread and 
my trade is leaving me." 

"We use the best — such a brand." 

"Why, I have that, but they must have changed 
quality on me." 

''That does not seem possible, for you got the other 
half of the same car load as ours. Perhaps you will 
find the fault is with your baker. He did well in 
warm weather; now the nights are cold. His yeast 
has run out " 

Correct. Some changes, and the business recover- 
ed and has grown. 



In one of those Florida hotels, years ago, they tried 
to do without engaging a pastry cook for the season, 
and might have got along very well had it not been 
for theinscrutible mystery that so envelops yeast os 
to make it impossible for ordinary home fv^lk to ever 
penetrate to the bottom of it. The company was 
coming but the yeast would not come nor the light 
bread. The family carryall was sent fifty miles for 
a baker, in haste. He came, he saw, he made some 
mash and poured it very warm into their cold and 
inert yeast, and in an hour it was all life, overflow- 
ing the top and filling another jar besides. Such 
wonderful witchcraft as he understood they never 
could expect to learn, so he had to stay the season 
through. It was well for him that he understood 
yeast. 



Scientists tell us that yeast is a plant, a festive 
801 1 of microscopic fungus, or multitudinous mass 
of it, of exuberant growth under the usuual condi- 
tions favorable toplint life. There is any desired 
amount of natural philosophy besides the above to 
be found in studying the singular ways of yeast, 
such as the different kind of fermentation and the 
changes produced in the flour, but the really practi- 
cal thing for bread-makers' profit to remember is 
that one point that yeast is a plant and to be cared 
as such As plants grow fast under the influence of 
warmth and moisture so does yeast. Hot water 
poured into a bed of plants will kill them and the 
excess of heat kills yeast, whether the ferment 



be too hot into which the starting yea«t is poured, 
or whether the dough be made too hot when it ii set 
with yeast in it to rise. Asa root or seed will be in 
the ground for months without growing if the 
ground be cold so will y(ast remain without life in 
a similar condition. And as a plant may be un- 
naturally forced to a sickly rapidity of growth till it 
fallsof its own weight so do yeast and dough act 
when (hey are hurried too much by being kept as 
hot as they can be without killing them. 

The best bread and yeast are made by giving 
plenty of time and gentle temperature for all the 
processes to be carried out in a natural manner. 

Accidental freezing solid does not kill yeast, nor 
seem to injure it. This refers only to common de- 
grees of co'd, not extremes.

About Flour. Graham Bread, Rye-an'

In fact, great emphasis has been laid upon the 
quality and manufacture of bread from early times, 
when the whitest and finest was called simnel cakes, 
and was concocted chiefly to please the palate of the 
rich and high-born, as well as the wasiel bread, not 
quite so aristocratic; whi^e the tourle, or twisted 
loaf, and black bread made from the coarsest por- 
tion of the wheat, or from some inferior grain, fell 
to the share of the poor. 

Nowadays we have discovered that the coarse fare 
furnishes more nutriment, and the rich have adopt- 
ed it and made it popular — Ilarper's Bazar. 

Every cure of corpulence must begin with these three 
maxims or absolute principles : discretion in eating, 
moderation in sleep, exercise on foot or horsebaon. 
To abstain more or less rigorously from all that 
is floury and starchy tends to lessen corpulence. 
You like bread; then eat brown or rye bread 
At breakfast, take brown bread a« a matter of 
course, and chocolate rather than coflfee. Strong

my as a Fine Art. 



Perfect yeast, quick and strong, and so sweet and 
tasteless that no harm can result from using it 
plentifully is the first requirement for making perfect 
bread and the quality of the flour is next to be tak^-n 
into account. The flour is too generally made to 
bear all the blame of poor bakings. A good bread 
maker with good yeast c n make better bread from 
second rate flour than a second rate workman gen- 
erally can from the finest. Yet in good hands the 
finest flour will produce rolls and loaves half as 
large again for their weight as those made of infe- 
rior flour. Shop bakers who hnve to count their 
profit by the number of loaves that a barrel of flour 
can be made to produce, know that several mor* 
loaves of the same weight, and of larger size, can bt 
made from fine flour than from coarse, showing that 
the best takes up most water, and from the bre^J- 



126 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



maker's point of view may be as cheip as the poor 
flour which costs less money. 



The usual tests for flour do not g«nerally amount 
to much in assisting the buyer, The miller's brand 
is his trade mark, and most of them try to keep up 
the quality of their best at an even degree of excel- 
lence. The brand is often the best guide. 

If two or three samples of flour are pliced in the 
hand side by side, and smoothed with a silver knife, 
the finest may be known by its greater freedom 
from bran. Yet when one sample is from red wheat, 
another from white, the appearances maybe decep 
tive. White wheat does not make the whitest bread, 
in a general way. A handful of flour pressed in 
the hand, if good, will retain its shape, while coarse 
flour falls apart like sand. Yet the best flour new- 
ly ground will not answer to this test, and poor 
flour with age will. 



Spring wheat flour may be white, but will not, 
unless in exceptional cases, make rolls and loaves 
of as good shape as winter wheat flour, they having 
a tendency to run out of shape, the dough being soft 
and sticky. It is winter wheat flour that makes the 
tall round handsome rolls and loaves. 



Good flour is slow to go through the seive, rolls 
up in balls and coats the sides. Poor flour passes 
through like buckwheat or meal. 



Flour improves with keeping, especially in white- 
ness. It should have six months age before being 
used for fine rolls. Bakers sometime buy flour that 
has become caked in the barrels through long keep- 
ing, and mix portions of it with the newer flour to 
impart whiteness and strength. 

It often improves the bread to mix two or three 
brands of flour together, particularly when one is 
older than the other. Spring wheat flour may be 
best worked off" by having some old winter wheat 
flour to mix with it. 



But this is all on the common assumption that 
good flour means fine, white flour, and the crowning 
glory of bread-making is to have bread snowy-white 
and delicate in taste and texture. A very large 
minority in our hotels, however, make known their 
preference for various kinds of bread of a coarser 
sort. 



Graham flour should be the unbolted meal of 
wheat, but not only that, the wheat should be good 
plump grain, such as would make fine flour. Very 
often the appearance and handling is such that 
graham flour seems little else than bran and shorts, 
aa if the thinnest wheat had been got rid of in that 
■hape. In other samples the flour is made by taking 
Mconda flour and mixing in an indefinite amount 



of bran, defrauding the consumer of the finest por- 
tion of the flour altogether. The beat remedy is to 
buy such flour only of a reputable miller who makes 
it a special care to select good wheat — generally 
white wheat — for the purpose. Another remedy is 
supplied by the proportions of the following receipts. 



517. 



Graham Bread. 



A standing article on the bill of fare of most hotels. 

2 pounds of graham flour, not sifted. 

1 pound of white flour. 

1 J pints of warm water. 

^ pint of yeast. (1 cup). 

1 teaspoon ful of salt. 

Commence 7 or 8 hours before time to bake. Mix 
the yeast and water together ; strain them into the 
graham. It makes a stifi" batter. That is the sponge. 
Let it stand in a moderately warm place about 4 
hours. Then add the white flour, knead and pound 
the dough. Very slightly grease the pan it was 
started in, place the lump of dough in it, brueh that 
over — no matter how slightly — with the butter brush 
and set to rise 2 hours more. Then make into 
loaves, rise and bake. 



Graham dough rises faster than white, and after 
being made into loaves should not be a'lowed to rise 
or proof too much, lest it be too crumbly to slice 
well. The bakers usually bake these in round 
moulds. 



Taking fine French rolls for the standard, graham 
rolls enjoy a degree of popularity in hotel service 
averaging about three to five. They are more diffi- 
cult to make — or at least to bake — and a fine graham 
roll is not to be met with everywhere. They don' t 
all know how to make them as nice as these. 



518. 



Graham Rolls. 



This is for fifty rolls of small size. 

2 pounds of graham, not sifted. 

1 pound of white flour. 

H piuts of warm water. 

^ pint of yeast. 

^ cup of reboiled molasses. 

1 egg — 2 whites are better. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Set sponge with the graham at 9 or 10 in th« 
morning, for rolls for supper; at about 1 add ail the 
other ingredients and make it stiS" dough. Let rise 
till 4. Then work the dough by spreading it out 
on the table, with the knuckles, folding over and 
pressing again repeatedly. Make iuto rolls in any 
of the ways to be hereinafter detailed for whi** 
rolls. Grease slightly between eacn one witn a 
brush dipped in melted lard or butter. Brush over 
the tops with the same, and set the rolls to rlM 



THE AXEBICAN PASTBlT COOK. 



Id7 



about 45 minutes. Bake carefully about 15 minutes. 
Brush over with clear water on taking them from 
the oven. Keep hot without drying out. 



There ig philosophy or something like it in that 
one egg. It closes the pores in the crust and re- 
tains the air of fermentation that otherwise would 
escape from the rough graham flour, and the result 
is increased lightness, softness, and better shape. 
No shortening should be allowed in the mixture. 



Such is the force of habit or custom, one must not 
expect to be accounted the best breadmaker in the 
world if our graham and brown breads be not brown, 
and our gingerbread be not "old-fashioned," that 
is dark colored. Graham rolls are expected to be 
light-brown in color. They don't look] natural 
otherwise; they are nicer so and not so likely to be 
taken for second-rate French rolls. But now that 
the march of civilization has taken away our old- 
fashioned black molasses and given us colorless 
Illinois sorghum syrup instead, it is hard to see what 
else we can do but use a spoonful of burnt sugar 
caramel for coloring, else our brown breads cannot 
possibly be brown. 



The trifle of sweetening called for in graham 
rolls makes the crust thin and soft. 



It is far better to set the sponge with the graham 
so as to soak and soften the bran, instead of taking 
up white bread sponge and working stiflF with gra- 
ham, as is oftencst done "for short." Best bread- 
makers in the world use themselves to the right 
ways from the first. 

Pastrycooks do not and need not measure the 
flour. They measure the three-fourths water and 
one-fourth yeast, and add all the flour needed to 
make dough. A cup, or half pint of fluid wets a 
pound of flour. 



It is immaterial whether the dough be made by 
setting sponge, or batter with yeast in it, as pre- 
viously directed, or all the ingredients put in a pan 
and mixed up at once. At night the latter way has 
to be adopted. The dough made by the receipt for 
graham rolls over night can be used part for loaves 
»nd part for muffins by the following short and easy 
method. 



519. 



Graham MufiQns. 



Makes about thirty. 

2 pounds of graham roll dough. 

2 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces (a bastingspoonful) of molasses. 

^ cupful of milk. 



2 whole eggs and 2 yolks. 

Take the dough that has been already prepared 
for making rolls. Warm it and the butter in a pan 
together. Put in the other ingredients and beat all 
together about 5 minutes. Grease tin muffin rings 
or gem pans. Half fill them. Rise half an hour. 
Bake 10 minutes. Brush over with butter or hot 
water. But if you have nb light dough made the 
muffins can be set from the beginning with : 

1 pound graham; ^ pound white flour; f pint 
milk; 1 cup yeast; salt, molasses, eggi?, butter, as in 
foregoing receipt. Mix and let rise 4 hours. Beat 
5 minutes, rise in rings till iight, then bake. 



Many of the people in poor heaUh who frequent 
the springs and pleasure places for recuperation are 
extremely criiical in the matter of such hygienic 
articles of diet as graham rolls and gems, and all 
the hints here given will be found useful in the en- 
deavor to meet their requirements. 



590. 



Graham Gems. 



Made with Bakingr Powder. 

1 quart of unsifted graham. 

1 quart of white flour. 

4 spoonfuls of baking powder. 
3 large cups of milk,

2 ounces of lard melted. 

Have the milk tepid and mix the lard and egg in 
it; the powder and small teaspoon of salt to be mix- 
ed in the flour. Stir all together and beat for 3 min- 
utes. Have the iron gem pans hot; drop in round 
spoonfuls of the fritter-like batter and bake ten 
minutes. 



As it is none of our business to decide which are 
the very best gems, here is another receipt to be 
tried when the sameness of the foregoing has be- 
come wearisome: 

2 pounds of graham; 2 eggs; 4 teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder; 2 basting spoonfuls of syrup; small 
teaspoonful of salt; 1 J pints of milk or water. Beat 
all to a stiff" batter. Make the gem pans hot and 
grease them. Drop in spoonfuls. Bake in slow 
oven 15 minutes.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



An hotel pastry cook and baker who had grown 
ashamed of himself, once told me that for years he 
went from one hotel to another, as pastry cooks do, 
find always finding the people earnestly wished for 
Boston Brown Bread, he as earnestly protested that 
it could not be made unless there was a bric^x oven 
in which to bake it 8 hour?, and as only about one 
in fifty of American hotels own a brick oven this 
usually ended the argument. 

And yet here and there would be some little house 
enjoying quite a reputation and a run of custom be 
cause of its much beloved Boston brown, or it might 
be only rye-and-injun, hot for breakfast or supper, 
or for Sunday mornings especially. No matter how, 
but as he grew wiser and older this pastry cook 
found the brick oven was by no means an artic'e 
indispensable, and Boston brown that was a thous- 
and times pronounced all that could be wished, he 
made by the following described methods. 



592. 



Boston Brown Bread. 



Raised witli Yeast. 



1 quart of corn meal. 
1 quart of graham. 
1 quart rye flour. 
1 quart white flour. 
1 quart of boi'.ing water. 
1 pint of yeast. 

1 small cup of molasses. 

2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 

J cup of burnt sugar coloring. 

The method here recommended is materially 
different from the common troublesome process; 
first, because troublesome processes cannot and will 
not be carried out in hotels doing good business 
and secondly, because this way produces as good 
results as if one sat up all night about it. 

Scald the meal by itself first, by pouring the boil- 
ing water on and stirring in a pan. Then add mo- 
lasses, salt, caramel. If still hot, let it stand awhile 
before adding anything else. When only milk 
warm strain in the yeast, then mix in the graham 
and rye and the white flour last. The dough will be 
like graham dough and can be worked on the table. 
Part of the white flour should be left over to dust 
with. After a little kneading, slightly grease the 
pan it was mixed in, place the dough in it, cover 
with a cloth and let rise moderately warm about 6 
hours. Turn on the table, knead a little, make into 
4 or 6 loaves, place in round moulds or pails, let rise 
about half an hour or an hour if to be baked instead 
of steamed. 

By this method no sponge is set, but the dough is 
mixed up stiff at once — care being taken not to let 
the yeast get Ecalded in the hot meal — greatly lessen- 
ing the trouble. If commenced in the middle of the 
day the loaves will be ready for the oven after the 



rolls at night, and should be baked two or three 
hours at very moderate heat. Or, mixed at night 
and made into loaves very early the bread may be 
baked in time for breakfast. But the best way is 
this : 

Make up the dough as directed, at 7 in the morn- 
ing Work and make into loaves at 12 or 1. After 
rising one-half hour set the iron pails containing the 
loaves in the steam-chest, or in a boiler with water, 
and steam in this way till 5 30. Then bake one-h4f 
hour and serve hot for supper, the remainder 
answering for cold bread to toast. 



When these loaves become hollow in the top it is 
because of too much rising or proof in the pails. 
Steaming does not arrest fermentation quick enough 
and they get too light and fall. 



The foregoing is one way that requires good 
yeast. The next is shorter still and takes baking 
powder instead. It is hard to say which is the 
better. You can be happy with either. 

523, Steamed Brown Bread. 

Made with Baking Powder. 

2 pounds of corn meal. 

1 quart of boiling water, 

1 cupful of dark mola?ses. 

1 pint of cold milk or water. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

6 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

1 pound of graham. 

1 pound of white flour. 

Scald the meal with the boiling water. Add the 
molasses and then rest of the ingredients — the powder 
being mixed in the flour. Beat up thoroughly. It 
makes soft dough. Put it in 2 or 3 iron pails having 
lids and steam 5 hours or more, then bake about 
20 minutes. 



Hotel providers who would have brown bread by 
these easy methods always, need to provide a set of 
pails that will stand baking, having bales and lids. 
They should last for years and require to be made of 
the best Russia iron, as these properly cared for, 
greased while hot and wiped out, never discolor the 
bread. 5 inches across, 8 inches deep. 



524, 



Rye and Indian. 



No different method is needed but to change the 
ingredients of Boston Brown so as to leave out the 
graham and the flour and double the proportions 
of meal and rye in their place. 



Bakers' rye loaves are made by the same method 
as French loaves, and will be found in that connec- 
tion at a subsequent page.

The Best White Bread and How 
to Make it. 

686. 

Archestratus, a friend of one of Pericles' sons; 
* * this great writer, during his travels, did not 
make inquiring into the manners of nations, since 
they always remain the same, but going into the 
laboratories where the deicacies of the table are 
prepared, he only held intercourse with those who 
could advance his pleasures. — Philosophical History 
of Cookery. 

The ardent dietetic morality which extolled the 
bread that was coarsest, brownest, stalest and most 
truly home-made, and caused fine white and fresh 
bread to be swallowed as if it were a sin against 
nature, is classed among the "Isms of forty years 
ago" in one of the January magazines. Dr. Syl- 
vester Graham of Connecticut, started the reform, 
which, running to great lengths at first, has result. 
ed, in the long ran, in a happy mean, a modific .- 
tion, a d greater variety in the popular bill of fare. 
The people in great numbers, who find the white rolls 
and bread irresistible may reap satisfaction from 
finding so eminent an authority as the author of 
"Gastronomy" in their favor. His pr'escription, the 
groundwork of his cure for thinness, for "a young 
sylph, or other airy creature, who wishes to assume 
a more material form" is "first of all, make it a gen- 
eral rule to eat nothing but newly-baked bread, es- 
pec ally the crumb, and plenty of it." And he had 
Btudiid such matters all his life. But as there are 
dinners and dinners, — so Cardinal Richelieu re- 
marks to his major domo, meaning that some are very 
bad, — so it should be said about bread. The rolls 
of Limet, of Rue de Richelieu, could not hurt any- 
body. 



52G. 



On one occasion the writer was called upon as a 
probably competent judge to pass opinion on the 
work of one of the reputed very best bread makers. 
There is a dubious kind of excellence in this line as 
in everything else that does not feel able to stand 
alone but always wants somebody to keep saying it 
excels. Such was the case here. The bread was 
extremely fine, yet, I venture to say the people did 
not enjoy it except to look at, and felt that some 
essential quality was lacking. It was white as 
chalk and a good deal like it ; fine-grained as deli- 
cate cake, but had no toughness nor elasiicity and 
crumbled when broken, like meal. It had a sweet- 
ish insipidity of taste, instead of the hearty relish- 
ing wheat flavor of good bread. It was made so by 
an immense amount of kneading the wrong way. 

These people did not invite instruction nor criti- 
cism, only praise. I said the bread was superhtively 
fine, and the 'ady was one of the best breadmakers 
in the world. That the bread was not good was a 
inental reservation. We all frequently make bread 
that is fine but not good, and they that have such 
for their regular diet sometimes find in a loaf of 



common bakers' bread a new revelation of how 
swee; the taste of bread can be, and wonder whence 
springs the difference. It is not what the bakers 
put in the bread but the proper method of working. 

Just the other day a magazinist spoke of good 
bread making as a lost art. A figure of speech, 
perhaps, or else the opinion of a lover of good bread 
whose experiences have been bad ; but if there be 
any grounds for such an idea to rest on the cause 
may be found in the unwillingness of instructors in 
cookery to properiy dwell upon eo seemingly simple 
and self-evident a matter as the proper way oi 
kneading dough. And very recently another inti- 
mated how many persons accustomed to " biscuit 
streaked with saleratus and heavy with lard, regard 
rolls white and light as newly-fallen snow as some- 
thing belonging to the households of princes, to the 
King of France's Kitchen, but not to be freely eaten 
by common folks." Now it is cheaper to have good 
bread than bad, and the bare formula for making it 
being so little and the understanding how so much, 
we are going to do our best to endeavor to draw atten 
tion to what the knack of making bread both good and 
fine consist J in — yeast and flour being good to begin 
with. 



It took one, otherwise excellent, pastry cook ten 
years to discover this knack for himself, but he was 
all the while the worst mystified man imaginable, 
because he had, when a boy, made rolls that people 
would eat in preference to anything else, while now 
every other kind of bre id was preferred to his hand- 
somest rolls The fault with them was the same as with 
the lady's fine, brittle and tasteless bread already 
spoken of. 

This man had been shown how to work in a 
routine way in a large bakery without ever being 
impressed with any idea of the particular way being 
essential to good quality, and when, afterwards, in 
a French kitchen where ornamentation was run to 
the extreme at the expense often of good flavor, he 
exercised his ingenuity till he could make rolls in 
forty difl'erent fancy shapes, he found, after all, they 
were in little demand, lie worked all the life out 
of the dough in making it into curliques. Then in 
abusy time a very common fellow came along and 
was set to make the ro Is. He was too common even 
to have a name except a familiar Tom, Dic'<, or 
Harry and was quite unconcious that the rolls he 
made were the firetthat had ever been eaten with a 
real zest and favored with a constantly increasing 
demand in that house. But after that the fancy 
breads were neglected and there was less cry for 
toast. Even the "help" — excellent judges of what 
is good, although. discretely silent — would steal the 
new man's rolls out of the corners of the pans as 
they passed —a thing never known to be done be- 
fore, as long as a biscuit could be had. 



130 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



And all the difference was in two different ways 
of working the same materials The superiority of 
the common fellow's rolls and bread was all owing 
to bis kneading the dough the right way. 

58T, Oommon Bread Dough. 



As a rule use one-fourth yeast to three-fourths 
water. 

The good potato yeast with no germs of sourness 
in it, such as we have already directed how to 
make, does no harm in still larger proportions whea 
the weather is cold or time of mixing late. But 
the whitest bread is made when the dough can have 
long time to rise, not hurried up. 

1 pint of yeast. 

3 pints of warm water. 

1 heaping tablespoonful of salt. 

8 pounds of flour. 

Makes 8 loaves of convenient size. 



5S8. 



Setting Sponge. 



Strain the yeast and water into a pan and mix 
in half the flour. Beat the batter thus made 
thoroughly. Scrape down the sides of the pan. 
Pour a spoonful of melted lard on top and spread 
it with the back of the fingers. This is to prevent 
a crust forming on top. Cover with a cloth and set 
the sponge in a moderately warm place to rise 4 or 
6 hours. 

529, Making up the Dough. 



The sponge having been set at 8 in the morning, 
beat it again about one, add the salt and make up 
stiff dough with the rest of the flour. Knead the 
dough on the table, alternately drawing it up in 
round shape and pressing the pulled-over edges 
into the middle and then pressing it out to a flat 
sheet, folding over and pressing out again. 

Brush the clean scraped pan over with the least 
touch of melted lard or butter — which prevents 
sticking and waste of dough— place the dough in 
and brush that over, too. Where economy reigns 
the strictest a little warm water in a cup, and tea- 
spoonful of lard melted in it will do for this brush- 
ing over and insures tlie truest saving and smooth- 
est bread. Let the dough rise till 4. 

530. 

The Important Ten Minutes Kneading 



^.t about 4 o'clock spread the dough on the table 
by pressing out with the knuckles till it is a thin 
uneven sheet Double it over on itself and press 
the two edges together all around first. This 
imprisons air in the knuckle holes in large masses. 
Then pound and press the dough with the fists till 
it has become a thin sheet again, with the inclosed 



air distributed in bubbles all through it. Fold orer 
and repeat this process several times Then roll it 
up. It will be 

LIKE AN AIR CUSHION. 

Let it stand a few minutes before making into 
plain rolls, cleft rolls, or loaves. 

Making Dough at Night. 



It would be a great hardship and in most cases 
impracticable to make the night dough by the 
sponge method, although the shop bakers do so, and 
work it in the middle of the night. Quite as good 
bread can be made by mixing up into stiff dough at 
first, provided proper precautions be observed. 
The danger is of too much fermentation, the dough 
being ready to bake hours before the time. When 
a sponge is set the fresh flour added to it hours after 
checks fermentation, but when all the flour is wet- 
ted at once, there is no check except the coolness of 
night keeps it back. In summer the dough may 
be mixed up with ice Witer instead of warm, at any 
time after supper and fermentation will not begin 
for some time after, while the flour is becoming 
whiter all the time for being so long in the dough 
state. 



How Much Kneading. 



Small quantities of dough can be easily injured by 
too much kneading. The true plan is to keep kneading 
till its India rubber-like toughness causes it to begin 
to break instead of spread out. Then stop and let 
it lose its springiness beforekneading again. 

531. Premium Family Bread. 



To have bread superlatively white and fine grain- 
ed and good besides, put the dough through the 
preceding described kneading process three or four 
times half aa hour apart. The dough made up stiff 
over night should be kneaded at 4 in the morning 
and again an hour after, in order to make good rolls 
for breakfast. This helps to make up for the loss of 
the thorough heatings of the sponge when the sponge 
method is practiced. 



533. Cooks and Bakers- 

"Why, good heavens ! we have lost our way. But 
what a delightful smell there is here of hot bread, 
Andree." 

"That is by no means surprising," replied the 
other, "for we are close to the door of a baker's 
shop." — Dumas. 

Anciently, — we read in Eoman antiquities — the 
cook and baker were one. In the hotel work of the 
present the same rule holds. This little book recog- 
nizes a distinction between the hotel baker or pastry- 
cook and the shop baker. The latter seldom does 
well when he tries hotel work. The hotel pastry- 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



131 



cook going into a bakery geaeially makes the goods 
richer than shop rules and profits will allow. This 
book applying to hotel w iys pursues a new path and 
is necessarily a little at variance with baker's 
methods. If it were a baker's routine we should 
have to describe three bucket sponges or ten buciet 
sponges; and when the baker makes up his dough 
he adds to his three bucket sponge about as much 
more warm water. 

This plan of adding more liquid to the sponge is 
commendable for checking too rapid fermentation 
— best way when loaf bread only is to be made, but 
not for rolls or fancy breads. The bakers' ways 
are referred to for illuBtrations for comparison 
chiefly. 

The essential points in bread making are the same 
whether in shops, hotel kitchens, or private houses. 
When to the baker's proper ways of wor ing, we in 
hotels add the small amount of enriching ingre- 
dients which they do not need and cannot afford in 
their larger operations, we produce the extra fine 
rolls a d extra bread, having which people think 
they can almost dispense with everything else. 

The lump of dough already prepared, smooth and 
like an air cushion, lies in layers or flakes, and it 
is another part of the art of good bread making not 
to disturb them much in making up. It might be 
hard to explain why this stringy texture preserved 
in tbe loaves sboull make a difference in the taste, 
but it is plain it does, and in this lies the desirablei- 
nessof whatare known as French loaves. 



633. 



Baker's Cleft Rolls. 



Petits Pains. 



Take a portion of the dough flat as it lies and 
without working it at all, spread it with hands and 
roUicg-pinto a sheet less than an inch thick. Cut 
this into 2J inch squares. Take two opposite cor- 
ners and press them into the middle, making long 
cushion shapes with pointed ends. Place them 
smooth side up on baking pans with plenty of room 
betwaen. Brush over with water. Let rise nearly 
an hour. Just before putting in the oven cut them 
lengthwise with a down stroke so as to nearly divide 
the two halves. Bake in a hot oven abcut ten 
minutes. 



534. Baker's French Loaves. 

The same as the preceding, of larger size. Cut 
the entire piece of dough in about 10 pieces. Flat- 
ten out without kneading Bring two opposite cor- 
ners together and press them into the middle and 
press the loaf sides together in long, pointed shape. 
then there are two ways of proceeding. 



1. Place each loaf with tbe smooth side down in 
a flowered napkin or piece of c eaa fljur s ck and 
set them to rise an hour that way, ia a deep pan or 
box just touching. The oven being ready, turn tbe 
leaf right side up on to the peel, cut it lengthwise 
down nearly to the bottom, and sbp it to iis place 
on the oven bottom. 

2. The above plan not being couveoient to prac- 
tice, make the leaves as befor j and place them riglt 
side up in the usual hotel bakiug pans, brush over 
with water, rise, cutas before, and bake ia the pans. 
There should be plenty of room between. Brush 
with water again when done. 



The bakers pursue a method so laboiious in mak- 
ing their flaky, stringy French loaves as would for- 
ever deter weakly peop-e from (rjing, if ii were the 
only way. But in this Cise kuowiedge ii lierally 
power The dough carefully kneaded oq the table 
in the way that has been directed reaches the same 
condition as if it had been worked in a trough with 
water with an immense expenditure of strength. 



535. 



Hotel Loaves. 



The crusty cleft loaves not being suitable to s'ice 
for the table, nor for toast, we make of the same 
dough slightly worked, a better sort. Cut the 
dough in eight pieces and moutd them up round, 
but not enough to destroy the texture — only from 6 
to 12 turns. Let stand on the table a few minutes. 
Press them out like dinner plates. Bring over two 
opposite edges and press them into the middle and 
place the long loaves side by side ia ihe pans. 



To Prevent Splitting at the Ends. 

It is curious to obrerve that tie simple way of 
folding the loaf just described prevents splitring 
open at the ends in baking, while one more folding 
in of the other two sides has often the opposite effect 
and causes much waste of bread that cannot be 
sliced. 



It makes a thin crust to bread and the loaves to 
part clean and even if they are brushed over with a 
touch of melted lard when placed in the pans. 



536. 



Plain Rolls. 



Mould the dough into little round balls and place 
them ju-t touching in the pan?, slightly greased be- 
tween. Rise an hour; bake 20 minutes; brush over 
with water when done. Keep hot without drying 
out or sweating the bottom on the iron pan. 

We shall come to the more delicate sorts of rolls 
further on.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



53T. 



Baker's Milk Bread. 



Make up the sponge and dough for this the same 
as for common bread, but use sweet milk instead of 
water. Its merit is its whiteness, fioe gmin, and 
sweetness of taste like French rolls. There are three 
essential points to be observed. 

1. Beat the sponge and dough extremely well, 
only adding the flour gradually and beating it in. 

2. Have the dough as soft as it is possible to knead 
it well, too soft to keep good shape as loaves apart, 
and bake the loaves in tin moulds. 

3. Put it in to bake after the rolls come out. As 
it must be of light color outside and browns too 
easily it can only have a slack oven to bake in. 
Brush over the loaves with milk when done. 



538. 



Rye Bread. 



The proper method with rye bread is the same as 
with French loaves, that is, the dough is to be work- 
ed in layers and nothing added but salt to the yeast 
and water ; the dough made up rather stiflf to keep 
good shape, and when the loaves are put in the 
oven, instead of a long downward cut merely score 
the rye loaves across diagonally three or four times. 

But for hotel use, where there is no brick oven, 
it does as well or better to make long loaves in pans 
as already directed for ordinary hotel bread. 



Some Cheap and Good Varieties of 
539. Sweet Breads. 



There is old Lindsay of Pilscottie ready at my 
elbow, with his Athole hunting, and his "lofted and 
joisted palace of green timber; with all kind of drink 
to be had in burg and land, as ale, beer, wine, mus- 
cadel, ma'vaise, hippocras, and aquavitae; with 
wheat-bread, main-bread, ginge-bread, beef, mutton, 
veal, venison, goose, grice, capon, coney, crane, 
swan, partridge, plover, duck, drake, brissel^ock, 
pawnies, black-cock, muir-fowl and caper-cailzies; 
not forgetting the excelling stewards, cunning bax^ 
ters, excellent cooks, and pottingars, with confec- 
tions and drugs for desserts." — Old author quoted by 
Scott — Waverly. 

We had dinner — where by the way, and even at 
breakfast as well as supper at (he public houses on 
the road, the front rank is composed of various 
kinds of "sweet cakes," in a continuous line from 
one end of the table to the other. I think I may 
safely say that there was a row of ten or a dozen 
plates set before us two here. To account for which , 
they s«y that when the lumberers come out of the 
woods, they have a cnving for cakes and pies and 
such sweet things, which there are almost unknown. 
And these hungry men think a good deal of getting 
their money's worth. No doubt the balance of vic- 
tuals is restored by the time they reach Bangor — 
Mattawamkeag takes off the keen edge. — Thoreau — 
T/te Maine Woods. 

So it appears from these extracts "ginge-bread" 
has been thought worthy to be mentioned in pla e 
in the grandest kind of a feast, and there are places 



where all sorts of sweet cakes are eaten with a 
hearty relish. 

We who have to serve such kinds side by side 
with hot French rolls need such assurances as the 
above — seeing our sweet breads and cakes c jme 
back egain neglected. The simpler kinds of sweet- 
ened breads and good ginger bread seem to be more 
acceptable in the ordinary hotel where the "balance 
of victuals" is always nicely adjusted, than the 
richer sorts yet to come. 



540. 



German Baker's Coffee Cake. 



4 pounds of light bread dough. 

8 ounces of sugar. - 

8 ounces of butter or lard. 

1 egg. (Not essential.) 

Take the dough at noon and mix in the ingredi- 
ents all slightly warm Knead it on the table with 
flour sufficient. Set to rise until 4 o'clock. Knead 
it again by spreading it out on the table with the 
knuckles, folding over and repeating. Roll it out to 
sheets sca'-cely thicker than a pencil, place on bat- 
ing pans, brush over with either water or meited 
lard, or milk. Rise about an hour. Score the cakes 
with a knife point as you put them in the oven to 
prevent the crust puffing up. Bake about 15 min- 
utes. 

One of the attractions of this plain cake is the 
powdered cinnamon and sugar sifted on top after 
baking, the cake being first brushed with sugar and 
water. Cut in squares and serve hot 

The foregoing makes a sheet of cake large enough 
to cover a stove top. 



541. 



Pic-Nic Bread. 



Another form of the coffee cake, cheap and good 
for school pic-nics and the like, and for sale. 

Mix a few ra'sins or currants in the German coffee 
cake dough. Roll out pieces to the size of dessert 
plates and half inch thick, brush over with a little 
melted lard, double them over like large split rolls. 
Rise and bake like bread, and brush over with a 
mixture of water, egg, and sugar. 



Currant Buns —Chelsea Buns. 
542. Washington Buns. 



Hot for supper. No eggs required. Favorite 
sort and quickly made. This makes 45. 

4 pounds of light bread dough. 

8 ounces of currants. 

8 ounces of softened butter. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

It is soon enough to begin these 2 hours before 
supper. Take the dough from the rolls at say 4 
o'clock. Spread it out, strew the currants over and 
knead them in Roll out the dough to I inch sheet. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



133 



Spread the butter evenly over it and the sugar on 
top of that Cut in bands about as wide as y ur 
hand. Roll tbem up like roly-poly puddings. 
Brush these long rolls all over slightly with a little 
melted lard so that the buns will not stick together 
in the pans. Then cut off in pieces about an inch 
thiok. Place flit in a buttered pan, touching but 
not crowded. Rise nearly an hour. Bike 15 
minutes. Brush over with sugar and water. Dredge 
sugar and cinnamon over. 

543. 

Oommon Rusk, or Buns "without Eggs. 

4 pounds of light bread dough. 

6 ources of butter or lard, 

8 ounces of sugar. 

1 tablespoon ful of cinnamon extract. 

Take the dough at about noon and work in the 
other ingredients. Let stand an hour, then knead 
thoroughly At 4 o'clock knead again, mould int> 
round balls, grease between each oue as you place 
them in the pans. Rise an hour, bake 20 minutes. 
Placed close together in the pans they are the ordi- 
nary sweet ru3k8. Set some distance apart they 
are round flat butss; maybe sugared on top and havft 
currants or carraway seeds mixed in the dough. 
The richer French varieties will be f.und further 
on. 



544. Yeast-Raised Gingerbread. 

4 pounds cf good light bread dough. 

1 J pounds of d irk molasses. 

12 ounces of butter or lard. 

1 tablespoonful of ground ginger. 

Little cinnamon, or other spice. 

Flour to work up to soft dough. 

An egg or two does not hurt it. Make up by the 
cofiee cake directions. Dredge granulated sugir 
over the top when done. Good for supper, hot. 

Speaking of gingerbread, however, the nex^, 
although not made with bread dough, is the best sort 
yet discovered for hotel suppers. Gingerbread is 
inclined to be tricky and uncertain, or more proper- 
ly speaking, stieky and uneatable, if not made wi h 
care. Too much molasses or too much soda or 
powder are usually the faults. This can be made 
with buttermilk and sodi if desired. 

545. Sponge Gingerbread. 

Sometimes called black cake and spice cake. 

1 pound of molasses. 

6 ounces cf sugar. 

8 ounces of butter, melted. 

1 pint of milk. 

6 eggs. 

1 ounce of ginger. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powc-jr. 



2 pounds of flour. 
Mel! the butter in the milk ma^le warm, and pour 
them into the molasses and sugar, mix, add ^ggs, 
ginger, powder, flour. Beat up well. 



545 a. Fairy Gingerbread. 

No eggs needed. 

1 cup butter— 7 oz. 

2 cups light brown sugar — 13 oz. 
1 cup milk — ^ pint. 

4 cups flour — 1 pound. 

1 teifpoonful ground ginger. 
Warm the butter and sugar slightly and rub them 
together to a cream. Add the milk, ginger and 
flour. It ma'^es a paste like very thick cream. 
Spread a thin coating of butter on the baking pans, 
let it get quite cold and set, then spread the paste 
on it no thicker than a visiting card, barely cover- 
ing the pan fr m eight. Ba^ e in a slack oven, and 
when done cut the sheets immediately into the 
shape and size of common cards. 



54C5. 



"Old Fashioned" Gingerbread. 



1^ pounds of molasses. 
8 ounces of butter or lard. 
3 eggs. 
1 ounce of ground ginger. 

1 teaspoonful of soda, large. 

2 pounds of flour. 

1 pint of hot water. 

Salt when lard is used. 

Melt the butter and stir it into the molasses and 
then the eggs, ginger and soda. 

The mixture begins to foam up. Then stir in the 
flour, and lastly the hot water, a little at a time 
Bake in a shallow pan. 



The three varieties preceding do well as small 
cakes, baked in patty pans or gem pins. The next, 
besides doing for sheet gingerbread, can a^so be 
mads into the plainest ginger cookies. Need brush- 
ing over with milk to look well. Sugar or comfits 
may be dredged on top. 

547. 

Soft Gingerbread -without Eggs. 

1 pound of molasses. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

1 pint of milk. 

8 ounces of butter. 

1 tablespoonful of ground ginger. 

1 teaspoonful soda and same of baking powder, 

4 pounds of flour- 
Warm the butter with the sugar and molasses and 
beat up about 5 minutes. Mix in the soda and all 
the rest of ingredients.

THE AMERICAN PASTBY COOK. 



It makes dough that can be rolled out and baked 
on pans. 

However, it is easy enough to make ginger cakes. 
But the baking of them — "aye, there's the rub!" 
There are cooks who, while the range is hot, cook- 
ing supper, can bake gingerbread of a nice light 
color without burn, gall, or bitterness, but 

548. English Tea Cakes. 

2 pounds of light bread dough. 

12 ounces of sugar. 

12 ounces of butter. 

4 eggs. 

J pound of flour to work in. 

I pound of currants. 

Takes about 5 hours time. Mix all the ingredients 
with the dough in the middle of the day. Let ri^e 
till 4. Then beat the dough well with a spoon — it 
is a little too soft to handle— and spread it thin on 
buttered pie piates. Rise about an hour. Bake, 
and split open and butter them. 

One teaspoonful of carraway seeds will suit better 
than the currants in some countries. Where the 
children have been raised on "Abernethy biscuits," 
to wit ; and know what carraway seeds are. In 
contrary situations it hurts a hous?, and the cook's 
sensibilities to have people picking the seeds out, 
thinking they are dirt. 



540. Hotel "French Rolls • 



An Inquiry into their Origin. 




Dishes worthy of special attention had ttteir name 
and quality ceremoniously proclaimed. — Philosophi- 
cal History of Cookery. 

An uncommon dish was introduced to the sound 
of the flute, a^id the servants were crowned with 
flowers. In the time of supper the guests were en- 
tertained with mu-ic and dancing, * * * 
but the more sober had only persons to read or re- 
peat selec! passages from books — Roman Antiquities 

The kinds of rolls shown in the cut, which are un- 
derstood to he par excellence French rolls, are of chief- 
est interest to us in hotels, for the two reasons that 
§T«rybody likes them — most potent consideration 



where the aim and end of all endeavor is to please~> 
and that (hey, at least, appear to J ; of American 
origin. 

I sud as much once to an old and educated Ital- 
ian cook who had been a great traveler, but be smil- 
ed: — "America is too young to have any cookery of 
her own ; you can find a foreign origin for every 
dish you have I remember seeing such rolls as 
those on the tables at restaurants and cafis in Eu- 
rope, when a boy, over fifty years ago" Yet at 
last this wag but a conjecture He could not be sure 
that what he saw were not the baker's c'eft rolls 
mentioned some pages back, and which have no 
greit merit over ordinary baker's bread. One of 
the best Amercan domestic c ok-books also men- 
iions "theclefc rolls which we so often find on the 
tables of the city restaurants" And we still re 
main in ignorance, even if they prove the same, 
whether they may net have been presented by 
America to Europe at first. The name, French r 11, 
may be but an American application, as if it had 
been taken for granted that whatever is admirab e 
in cookery must be French. It is the popular under- 
standing of a split roll or pocket-book shape that can 
be pulled open hot, and admits a lump of butter 
within its melting clasp, but never so far as I can 
find out has been described in any but American 
book sand those domestic. 

The earliest dated mention of French rolls I have 
met with in the merely cursory search which such a 
mijor matter justifies, is the following, recently 
republished in the Reportee from "Forney's Pro- 
gress" : 

* * * * i« A public resort known as Spring 
Garden. The hotel attached to the premises was

French rolls, pies and tarts drawn from 7 to 9 ; 
mead and cakes.' " 

This shows that French, rolls were "the thing" at 
a date even anterior to the culminati'g period of 
modern French cookery, before the revolution. 

But the French rolls of that advertisement ; of 
the quotation from Savarin at the opening of this 
book, of the quotation from Bulwer at the head of 
the next division — the French rolls of the trades- 
people who buy them hot for breakfast of the bakers 
in all the European towns are only little round 
loaves — crowded into the pans so that they rise to a 
(all shape, and taken from the oven at intervals, 
kept smoking hot under green baize covers — made 
a trifle richer than ordinary bakers' bread. The 
sp'it roll shown in the picture is in all likelihood an 
American improvement 

In "Quenliu Durivard" (chap, iv) Sir Walter 
Scott gives the most explicit information in this re-

g»rd. At the breakfast — "There wai a delicate 
ragout, with just ih&t petit point de V ail which Gas- 
cons love and Scottiahmen do not hate. There wjs 
<ho most exquisite white bread, made iuto little 
round loaves called boules, (whence the bakers took 
their French name Boulangers) of which the crust 
was so inviting that, even with water alone it would 
have been a delicacy. But the water was not 
alone ** 

The probability that split rolls are an American 
improvement is strengihened by the apparant ab- 
sence of any mention of tbem in the best foreign 
cookbooks. Seeing how suitable the shape shown 
in the cut is for saadwicbes one would have expect- 
ed Jules Gouflfe (about 1860) to adopt it instead of 
this circumstantial direciion for • 'rolls with foie- 
gras ;" he says, "Taie 24 small French rolls of an 
oval shape, 2\ inches by 1^, rasp the rolls and sit 
them open lengthwise without separating them ea- 
tirely." The Cuisine Classique directs much the 
same way, to cut oflE" the tops of roll and brioche, 
(sort of butter rolls) and remove the inside crumb, 
for sandwiches and timbales. So a!so the "Modern 
Cook," (1840) and, later, '-Model Cookery," which 
only directs to make French rolls in long shapes 
placed side by side. A number of leaser works 
cither ignore French rolls a togethrr or treat the 
making up in round balls as a matter of course. 

On the contrary, the writer of these lines worked 
with a man, A. Nels m byname, making bo.h the 
shapes shown, as far back a 1850, on one of the dd 
time, high-living floating palaces of New Orleans, 
and found them then as ever since the most popular 
of all. The man's home was at Nashville, Tenn. 
Judging from his age and experience aad his un- 
conciou3ne3S of there being any novelty in this sort 
of rolls it seems fi.ir to assume that he had been used 
to them for ten or fifteen years before. Some four 
or five years after I saw the same in Cincinnati and 
Evansvi le, under the name of Parker House rolls 
Since then in numerous American publications they 
may be found ca led by those and other names — 
Tremont House rolls for one. 

Mr. Charles Wood, for an ordinary lifetime baker 
at the Tremont House, Boston, drawn out in reply 
to a newspaper paragraph crediting him with the 
origination of /VencA rolls in this country — mean- 
ing the split rolls shown in the cut— only dates back 
the making of his pattern about twentj-six years, 
and explains that Mr. Paran Stevens required him 
to make rollslike some he had seen on a European tour 
Mr. Wood does not in his published lei ter say that the 
rolls he produced were the s^ me as the Europem, 
but only that after several months trial he produce < 
what satisfied Mr. I'aran Stevens — who may still 
kave had in mind the French brioche^ or even the 



c'eft rolls whose texture is in flakes and coils, and 
their merit being individual loaves. 

It appears that (he general hotel and traveler's 
understanding of the term is by no means univer- 
sal. Let us n ake rolls French, accordiag to the 
European unders'anding, and never so good, if they 
be round, tall, oval, oblong or twisted, some person 
will send tbeoi back, and looking at the bill-of faro 
will say bring him some French rolls. And another 
great lover of bread will say, "these are all very 
we!1, but you ought to see the French rolls they 
have at — " some other house. Nevertheless a letter 
from Russia published 'n the Reporter two years 
ago remarked how much better the dedicate soft rolls 
there were "than the French, which are nearly all 
crust.'' 

These Russian rolls were doubtless the same as our 
"French." Puzzled by these diverse ideas I 
wrote to the Royal Baking Powder Co., who had ex- 
hibited the making of "Vienna Rolls" with powdpr 
at the Centennial, in Philadelphia, and the pres - 
dent kindly answered with drawings showing for 
French rolls, the cleft crusty loaves of the bakers — 
directions for making which bave already been given 
at length — and their Vienna rolls were in shape 
like those, plain ones, in our picture. There is a 
remark in one of the higher-class cook-books recent- 
ly published, that hot breads for breakfast and sup- 
per are but little used except in the West. Accord- 
ingly our hotel French rolls are no: described in it at 
all. And yet the Parker and Tremont Houses are 
in the East, and Boston people everywhere are exhib- 
iting their rolls to the heathen with pride. Are those 
Boson hotels to be regarded asderiving much of their 
fame from the introduction of this peculiar institu- 
tion where before it was unknown? As an example 
of how a thing nay haxe various names in difl"er- 
ent Jocilities : Last year a Canadian hotel steward 
who went West and conducted a first-class house, 
well knew the merit and importance of fine rolls, 
yet so little acquainted with their usual name that 
he had them printed on his bill-of-fare "buns." So 
without really appearing on the bill at all, the s lit 
ro Is experienced an increasing demand from three 
or four hundred to over eight hundred at a meal, 
and so it went till abo-it the time the third batch of 
supper and breakfast bills were to be printed, when 
the pastrycook ventured to intimate that "buns" 
were very rarely called for, but the "no names'*-^ 
the French rolls which did not appear at all upon the 
bill were having a tremendous runail the same. Then 
the name was printed right. It is not to be inferred 
that the hotel steward was ignorant, but only that 
these rolls were not familiarly known in the section 
whence he came. 



Perhaps nine out of ten of the people outside the 
circulatijg intelligence of our hotels, if agkrd tht 



136 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



meaning of the term "pocket-book roll," would 
guess it to mean a roll of five and ten dollar bills — 
sometimes called greenbacks, and sometimes Spin- 
nerisms. It is no such thing, but a roll just like 
Those in our cut, It is a local domestic name for 
the hotel French roll. A Western author, Miss Far- 
man, of Michigan, so describes it and the method 
of making, in the "Cooking Club of Tu-wh;t Hol- 
low," in the children's Wide Awake, and speaks as 
if the appellation were one well known and under 
stood among home folk, although so strange to cur 
hotel bill-of-fare. However, it must be owned, our 
rolls are the more like a pocket-book, (with s.lk or 
satin covers) the better t hey are made; for t here is more 
sense in having a somewhat flat shape, not too thick 
for a bite, than the taller form that is neither loaf 
nor slice 

Through all the foregoing, and many other con- 
siderations too tedious to mention, I have arrived 
at the suppositions that French rolls, as understood 
by commercial travelers and other hotel frequenters, 
are of American origin; that they were evolved out 
of the competition between Boston hotels ; that 
they were first a specialty of the Parker House, 
that thence tbey spread rapidly to wherever there 
was good livirig, because the travelling people went 
braogiyg about them, and that they have found their 
way like pilgrims and strangers into the domestic 
world, contentedly taking any pet name that may 
have been thrust upon them. All of which is re- 
spectfully submitted. 

650. 

However that may prove tobe, I would advise that 
rolls of any other shape be denominated on the bill- 
of fare simply hot rolls, and the term French roll, 
in American hotels, should always be understood to 
mean a split roll like these shown.

"Well," said Mr. Copperas who, occupied in fin- 
ishing the buttered cake, had hitherto kept silence, 
"I must be oflF. Tom,— I mean De Warens,— have 
you stopt the coach?" 

"Yees, sir." 



"And what coach is it?" 

"It be the Swallow, sir." 

"0, very well. And now Mr. Brown, having

before." — Bulwer — The Disowned. 

Perhaps we, behind the scenes in hotels, take 
different views of what is important, from the ma- 
jority of people. With the matter in hand, fur 
instance. Individuals, or a family, va^j never even 
see a hot roll on their table, and ye never realize 
how unfortunate they are. The "sour grapes'" phi- 
losophy may help them, and they believe hot rolls 
are not wholesome, anyway. It is really of no con- 
sequence in isolated cases. But when a whole hotel 
full of people show a decided liking for rolls, so that 
they could not well enjoy a meal without, does not 
the increased size of the matter justify our case? 
There are lean times, too, in hotels, when the meat 
is poor, game out of market and spring lamb not 
come in ; when poultry almost disappears and 
oysters are no more ; neither choice vegetables nor 
new fruits have arrived. Then the regulars grow 
discontented and seek new pasture — at the restau- 
rants where sliced baker's bread is set before them 
— at the opposition hotel where, whatever else they 
may try to have, the rolls are unwholesome wads of 
dough, or dry and unpalateable biscuits and grimy 
cakes. Then the regulars return to their pr per 
homes like good boys, and say it is all very well 
over there, but they doa't have good rolls — and 
w th such rolls as these they can almost dispense with 
everything else. In such cases may not the pastry- 
cook claim a right to loom up tall and exalt his 
trade?

French Rolls. 



For about 60 split rolls. 

3 large cups of water or milk. 
1 large cup of yeast. 

1 ounce of salt. (A heaping tablespoon.) 

2 ounces of sugar. 

2 ounces of lard or butter. 

4 pounds of fl )ur 

Set sponge at 8 in the morning with half the flour. 

At 12 or 1 add all the enriching ingredients and 
work up stiff. 

All the detailed instructions for making the dough 
and kneading it the right way have been given 
already under the head of common bread. 

Afer the 4 o'clock kneading proceed to make the 
dough into rolls. 

Persons in practice find it quickest to pull off 
pieces of dough of right size and mould them up 
instantly. 

1. Others cut off strips of dough, roll them - in 
lengths and cut these up in roll sizeso 

2. Mould them up round with no flour on the 
beard and only a dust on the hands, and place them

in regulf rows on the table — the smoothest side 
down 

3. Take a little rolling pin — it looks like a piece 
of new broom handle — and roll a depression across 
the middle of each, as in the cut. 

4. Brush these over with the least possible melt- 
ed lard or butter, using a tin-bound varnish brush 
for the purpose. 

5. Double the rolls, the two -buttered sides to- 
gether as seen in the cut below, and place them in 
the pans diagonally, with plenty of room so they 
will not touch 




6. Brush over the tops of the rolls in the pans 
with the least possible melted lard again and set tl em 
to rise about an hour — less or more according to 
temperature. 

7. Bake in a hot oven, about 10 minutes. Brush 
over with clear water when done. 

Keep baking at short intervals and keep hot with- 
out drying out. 

The particular feature of these rolls, it is seen, is 
the folded shape, allowing them to be opened when 
done, and this is the result ofbrushing over with but- 
ter. Rolls placed close together in pans will part clean 
and entirely separate wherever they have been so 
greased between in the making. 

The preceding receipt producing fine French rolls, 
good enough for anything, the next are no-names. 
The addition of eggs and butter does not make a vast 
diflFerence, but still makes them creamy colored and 
crisp. 

And if a body choose to name either of the two 
for some favorite hotel, need any other body kick? 
Possibly their name may be Parker, Tremont, Re- 
vere, Brunswick, French, Clarendon, St. James o^ 
Windsor rolls. Who shall decide or prove what 
they are?

1 ounce of salt. 

All the flour the fluids will take up, or ^ pounds 
Make up either sponge or stiff dough, as may be 
most convenient. The latter way is best at night. 
All the ingredients may be put in at once, but the 
milk should not be made too warm in summer, when 
the dough has to be made 12 hours before wanted. 



Ricl\,est. 



3 cups of sweet milk. 

1 cup of yeast. 

6 ounces of butter, melted. 

6 yolk s of eggs. 

3 ounces of sugar, 

1 ounce of salt. 

All the flour it will take up — or about 5 pounds. 

A larger proportion ofyeastmay beusedin winter 
The dough ought not to want coaxing under a 
stove to rise. Our yeast made from good stock 
brings the dough up fast enough anywhere in a 
warm room, and bread thus easily raised is alw ys 
the best and sweetest. Half yeast to half milk or 
water is better thao too little. 



If these pockel-book shaped rolls are such general 
favorites, why are they not universally adopted and 
found everywhere? The directions a little way 
back numbered 1 to 7 explain the reason why. 

These rolls are very tedious to make and take 
up one person's time from all other kinds of bread. 
When business is dull the pastrycook makes them in 
great perfection for the few people, but as soon as 
the house begins to fill up the work begins to 
crowd and the tedious split rolls are discon- 
tinued just at the time when they are really 
needed and would do most good. The reme- 
dies are, to leave out the unimportant kinds and 
give the time to these, and where it is impossible to 
give these rolls the 5 or 6 handlings, rather than 
abandon, cut them out instead. To do this, roll the 
dough to a sheet as if for biscuit. Brush over with 
melted lard. Cut out and double over. French 
rolls made without yolk of egg will come out the 
smoothest-looking when baked, if made that way. 



554. 



Butter Rolls. 



Sometimes called tea cakes, and also Sally Lunn. 

2 pounds of light bread dough. 
1 ounce of sugar (a spoonful). 
4 ounces of butter. 

3 yolks of of eggs. 

1 teacup of milk or cream. 

1 pound of flour to work in. 

Take the dough, already light, 4 hours before the 
meal, and mix in all the ingredients. Let rise 2 
hours. Knead, then make the dough into round 
balls and roll them flat. Brush over with melted 
butter and place two of the flats together, one on the 
other. Press in the center. Rise an hour, and 
bake. When done, slip a thin shaving of fresh but- 
ter inside each and brush the top over si ghtly, too. 
Should be made very small if to serve whole, or as 
large as saucers, to cut.

out thin. Fold over and roll out once more ; then

same as rolls. When no pie paste on hand, butter

Finest Hotel Bread. 



Sometimes called Vienna bread, and French bread. 

Make the dough by the receipt for French split 
rolls, and knead it several times accordiog to the 
extended directions already given for common bread. 

This makes bread so white and fiae that it vies 
with the napkins on the best appointed tables, and 
elicits admiration from the most f istidious. It is a 
feather in the hotel baker's cap when very particu- 
lar, excellent and discriminating housekeepers out- 
side, send to beg a loaf of this extra fine bread for 
their company days. That's the on y sort of pre- 
miums hotel fellows are ever allowed to win. Re- 
member, this bread should be kneaded 3 or 4 differ- 
ent times, at intervals apart.

A regular Cape Cod man with whom we par'eyed, 
*■ * * he looked as if be sometimes saw adough-

Why does everybody laugh when there are d ugh- 
Buts in the case? Even Thoreau, who laughs but 
Mldom. There is a pleasant little piece about 



doughnuts in the Congressional Record, that was 
spoken by a Pacific coa t senator— it is too long to 
repeat here— and it is said all the senators laughed 
at that. But if we place on the board some royal 
doughnuts, perhaps the original kind wi h their 
original Germ»in name A;rojt?/e7i— krapfen with apricots 
or wiih cheese, or flavored with orange flower water, 
it loo^s as if it will be bard to find the fun that 
dwells in native doughnuts, and, essentially, that is 
all these are, though they have appeared in regal 
bills-of-fare.

German Puffs. 



1 pound of light bread dough. 
6 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces of sugar. 
^ cup of milk. 

10 yolks of eggs. 

1 J pounds of flour. 

Little salt. 

These can only be made the soft, light yellow 
puff-balls they ought to be, by a strict and thorough 
method of working the ingredients together. 

Take the dough 6 hours before the meal and mix 
in the butter, sugar, milk and salt. Set in a warm 
place awhile, then thoroughly beat together. Add 
two yolks at a time and flour by littles alternately, 
beating against the side of the pan. Then turn out 
the dough and knead it on the table. Set away to 
rise about 3 hours Knead the dough twice more, 
as directed for rolls, but more thoroughly, till air 
will snap from the edges when pinched Mould out 
in little balls. Brush these over with melted lard 
to prevent hardening outside. Rise half an hour 
or more on greased pans. Fry in sweet lard. May 
be sugared over or served with sauce, or as dough- 
nuts, cold. They soak grease if raised too much

"Little Pittsburgh" Doughnuts. 

These are doughnuts with a little history attach, 
ed — but let us make them first. 

4 pounds of light bread dough. 

8 ounces of sugar and syrup mixed. 

2 eggs. 

2 or 3 ounces of lard, melted. 

Powdered sugar to dredge over. 

Lard to fry. 

Take the dough from the breakfast rolls, say at 9 
in the morning, in Winter. In Summer the dough 
worked up at mid-day will do. Mix in the ingre- 
dients, let stand half an hour. Work up stiff with 
fl jur sufficient, and set to rise about 4 hours. Then 
knead, and roll it out to a sheet. Brush over the 
whole sheet of dough with very little melted lard. 
Cut out with a two-pound tomato can, and cut out 
the middle of each with a little empty two ounce 
ground cinnamon can. This makes rings, which

done. They cook in about 5 minutes. 



When Leadville first began grinding in crowds of 
mining men poor, and grinding them out rich, the 
poor men as thej went in were often hard put to it 
for something to eat, and they never laughed at a 
doughnut, but treated it with respect. As saloons, 
boarding houses, clothing stores, stables, theatres, 
and even saw-mills and wood yards hastened to c ill 
themselves the "Little Pittsburgh," for the very fa- 
mous mine which was at first ihe life of the camp, 
the bakers did likewise, and the makers of the pre- 
ceding excellent doughnr.ts finding them a sort of 
bonanza as yet undeveloped, hastened to call them 
Little Pittsburghs, too. Purs ing this vein they 
went o J and advertised extensively. You could get 
a Little Pittsburgh doughnut for ten cen's at anj 
hour of the day or night, and a glass of dried-apple 
cider for the same price ; but in a commutation 
arrangement you could get a d ughnut and a glass 
of the cider together for fifteen cents. So Little 
Pittsburgh doughnuts became a part, and indeed, a 
leading feature of the camp. They were in two-line 
local notices scattered all through the papers, so 
that nobody could miss them. It seemed, in fact, 
as if all^the news was gathered for the express pur 
posf of drawing attention to doughnuts. One day 
it would be : 

*'Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars has 
been oflFered and refused for the Chrysolite mine." 
And as a sequel : 

"There's noihiugin camp can equal those Little 
Pittsburgh doughnuts." Or, perhaps : 

"Our esteemed fellow citizen fell down a shafi 
600 feet deep, last evening. He struck on his head 
and probably never knew what hurt him." 

"0 1 those Little Pittsburgh doughnuts are so 
very fine, if you try them once you'll buy them 
every time, at the Union Bakery." 

So, although the doughnuts were alwayn the same, 
there was always somethicg fresh and pleasant to 
give them a new zest Sometimes it would be only 
a hanging, or a midoight garroting, but the chorus 
of doughnuts kept right on at the end of every per- 
formance, great or small. As a consequence these 
doughnuts had a great run. It is hard to fathom 
motives. Perhaps some people ate them fur spi-e, 
trying to abolish them and their "damnable itera- 
tion," but of course that was useless, there were 
plenty more where these came from. They were 
placed in a tentative way on the best hotel tables, 
and they took — or at least the people took and par- 
took. Evidently the=e Little Pittsburghs were pop 
ular with all. 

But the halcyon days of ten-cent dcughnuts were 
Bhort and few, for soon competition came and began 
cutting them out wi h three-pound tomato cans in- 



stead of two-pound, making them so much larger. 
Not satisfied with that, other competitors left out 
the eggs and half the t-ugar and sold &> five cents. 
There wa=i no margin to pay fur advertisir g ia that. 
Little Pittsburgh doughnuts weakened and c<me 
down and the advertising c ased. None may know 
what subtle conLectiun there may be in the cases, 
but both the Leadville newspapers soon after died, 
and the Little Pittsburgh mine itself experienced a 
temporary collapse. I think it would have paid 
both the papers and the mining company to have 
gone on advertisi?)g the doughnuts at bed-rock 
pricrs, or even free, for when they left them out 
they left out the spice of the paper, and as the dough- 
nuts had boosted Little Pittsburgh i' would only 
have heen fair for Little Pittsburgh to boost- but it 
is useless moralizing. 

The next are the cheap, light-colored and large 
doughnuts that knocicd the bottom out of the rich, 
brown Little Pittsburghs.

have the sugar all well dissolved, and having knead-

Some KruUers. 



The cakes at tea ate short and crisp. — Goldsmith, 

Cruller, KruUer. Old English, crull, curled; 
crule to curl. German, kruUe, something curled. 

A curled or crisped cake boiled in fat — Webster. 

The bakers for doughnuts, but women should 
make the crullers every time. Too heavy a hand 
with the sugar and, worse still, with the baking 
powder will make them a burning disgrace, a greasy 
sain upon hotel cookery. Besides, only women 
know how or have patience to curl crisp crullers 
into wonderful knots, twirls, twists and ringlets. 



The primitive form of cruller is plain beaten 
biscuit dough, rolled extremely thin and cut into 
ribbons, then fried. A handful of sugar added to 
the dough makes a better kind, and many are the

people in the d'^mestic world who would not give 
them in exchange for any more cake-like varieties. 
For hotel supper tables, to change with dough- 
nuts, the following are the best. 

564. 

Crullers. Best and Quickest. 

2 pounds of flour. 

3 or 4 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
Large half pint of milk. 

4 ounces of butter. 
6 ounces of sugar. 

4 eggs. Salt. Nutmeg flavor. 

Mix the powder in the flour. Dissolve the sugar 
in the milk, add the eggs, and the butter melted, 
salt and flavor. Pour this fluid mixture into the 
middle of the flour and mix up like biscuit. Cut out 
and fry right away. A quick way to shape them 
is to cut in rings with a double cutter, having a small 
cutter in the middle, and another way is to cut the 
thin rolled sheet in bands with a paste Jagger, and 
divide that into pieces like three fingers attached at 
one end — or like a fork head. Sugar over when 
done. 



These crullers take twice as much time to fiy as 
doughnuts. 

565. 

Richest Crullers, or Pried Cakes. 

Good to keep, to send to folks by stage or express, 
or to pack up for a fishing party or a mountain 
climbiog. Don't put any baking powder in them. 

12 ounces of powdered sugar. 

6 eggs. Flavoring. 

Half cup of milk. 

6 ounces of butter. 

2 pounds of flour. 

Mix up like cake, by creaming the butter and 
sugar together, then beating in the eggs and milk 
and flour. Roll out, cut in shapes and fry. 



In addition to the foregoing, it may be useful to 
remember, all the rusks, buns and brioches can be 
fried as dougnuts when there happens to be more 
dough than is needed to bake.

Rolls. 



Make good roll dough with the finest flour and 
knead it well in layers as already directed for other 
varieties. 

The milk bread dough is understood to be the 
proper article, but the hotels where milk can be had 
for bread-making must be very few, and no person 
not otherwise informed can tell the difference be- 
twixt that and our French roll dough. 

1. Mould out little balls as for split rolls. 

2. Roll these out in shape of plates, and very 
thin. 

8. Fold these by bringing over two opposite 



edges and making them meet in the middle, and 
then bring over the other two edges likewise, mak- 
ing a square piece of folded dough. 

4. Roll this out a little flatter, brush over with 
melted butter or lard, and fold over like other split 
rolls. They are square ended instead of half moon 
shapes. 

This is the slowest and most tedious of all shapes, 
but the rolls are almost as flaky as pie paste. 



56T, BRIOCHE AND RUSKS. 



For Breakfast, Lunch and Tea. 



Perhaps you want to know what sort of a break- 
fast one gets at Young's. I wii^h this was an essay 
on housekeeping, so that every point could be en- 
larged upon. But the same wonder comes up at 
every notable restaurant, why people can't hive just 
as good eating at home every day and why they 
never by any possibility do so. Why the dining- 
room cannot be as coo', as orderly and spotless, the 
melon as crisp, the saiai as fresh and piquant, the 
cutlet as brown without, as melting and juicy with- 
in, or the bread and butter as perfect as that at 
Young's, will always be remarkable to any one con- 
demned to domestic interiors. — Boston Letter in N. 
Y. World. 

Dust unto dust; what must be must. 
If you can't get crumbs, you had best eat crust. 

— Old Song. 

She would talk of the last tragedy with the em- 
phatic toneof aconpois eur, in the same b.eath that 
she would ask, with Maria Antoinette, why the poor 
people were so clamorous for bread when they might 
buy such nice brioche for two-pence apiece — Bulwer- 
Pelham. 

The above allusion to brioche appears in nearly 
the same words also in one of Dumas' prefaces — 
"Louise de la Valliere"' — I think, but the solecism 
circulates with the point upon other articles of diet 
as well; as in one place the surprise is that poor 
peasants should prefer potatoes to meat, and only 
last month, in a magazine, it waa a ''French prin- 
cess," and "chicken broth " 



So far as living on the best of bread goes, there 
need be no reason why people condemned to do- 
mestic interiors should have to suffer from the com- 
parison with those in hotels and restaurants, for 
after the details of the simple art of making it, set 
forth in these columns, there is only needed dili- 
gence and a proper degree of pride in the resulting 
product. 



The English are corrupting our language dread- 
fully. They call our crackers biscuits; our biscuits 
they call Scotch scones; our muffins, if they have 
them, seem not to be called muffins, for thit name 
is given to a poorer sort that is baked on'akind of 
griddle, and in like manner they call our rusk buns, 
while fresh and hot, and only accept them as T-usks 
when sliced and dried brown in the oven. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK.

Brioches and French rusks, the half dozen varie- 
ties of hot breads which seem to be popular'y associ- 
ated with those names in the United Slates, ars un- 
surpassed for the afternoon teas which are becoming 
fashionable, and for lunch, and for French break- 
fasts of bread and cofifee 

We find *'brioche, with cheese," and wiih fruit, 
a- so forming parts of a course ia some "royal'' din- 
ner menus. 

At the great meat, fowl, fish and potato suppers 
and breakfasts of American hotels, these kiuds seem 
to find no proper place. They are well worih prac- 
ticing, however, for more domestic occasions, and 
have always been considered the highest test of 
skill in bread-making. 



508. Brioche, or Butter Rusks. 



1 pound of good, lively, roll dough. 
6 ounces of butter. 

2 ounces of sugar. 

Half cup of milk or cream. 
10 yolks of eggs. 

Little salt. 

1^ pounds of flour. 

They require 5 hours time to make, raise and 
bake. 

Warm the butter, sugar and cream, with the 
dough, together in a pan, and then mix thoroughly. 
Beat in the yolks, two at a time, and most of the 
flour, gradually bringing the mixture to a smooth, 
yellow dough. Then knead it thoroughly, and after 
that set it away to rise. In about three hours knead 
the dough the second time, and an hour after knead 
once more, then make out as direct ed for French 
rolls and notch the edges with a knife, to make the 
shape shown in the cut of rolls. 

They rise and bake in the same time as rolls. 
Brush over with butter when done. 

560. The Many Uses of Brioche. 

It being eminently French, and every French 
cook mailing briuche by a diff'erent receipt — usu- 
ally with more butter than the foregoing — as might 
be expected, this unsweetened kind of cake figures 
considerably in French cookery. One says it is a 
spongy kind of cake resembling Bath buns. An- 
other says it should be rich, yellow and like a 
sponge, whence it tikes its name. One mixes rai- 
sins, currants and shred citron in it for lu ch atd 
tea bread, and makes it in various fancy shapes and 
twists, also in large cakes. Another bakes the 
dough in f jrm of round rolls, cuts off" the top, takes 
out the crumb and fiJa with chicken or other meat, 
or, bakes iu little moulds like oval gem pans, re- 
moves the inside and places in the shell or timbale 
thus made a cooked bird with its gravy and dishes a 
pyramid of these on a napkin. Still another steeps 



slices of brioche in orange syrup and fries them in- 
closed in batter as fritters; and at a costly and ele- 
gant dinner given in New York, on last Christmas, 
"brioche crusts, with fruit" appeared among the 
pastries But the following sweet varieties might 
be employed for that. 

One poinr in bread making that, like hand- 
moulding, can only be learned through practice is 
the right pitch of lightness to be allowed. Some 
stress has been laid on the lightness, sponginess and 
large size of rolls and loives, because of the aver- 
sion we all have to heavy bread, which is ruinous 
to health. The inexpericLcd are cautioned against 
running to the other extreme There is a point 
when the rolls have reached a certain height they 
begin to settle out of shape and to crack open. A 
little before this is the time to bake. 



Butter rusks of our pattern should open and curl 
backwards in baking, therefore should not be 
brushed over with butter when panned as rolls 
are. 



5tO. 



French Sweet Rusks. Richest. 

The receipt for making these is inquired for at 
peaces where they are made in perfection, perhaps 
oftener than any other. They are cakes rather 
than bread ; very showy, and never fail to attract 
notice. Fhould only be attempted with the strong- 
est yeast or lightest dough, as they are otherwise 
slow to rise. The art to be acquired through prac- 
tice is to make them elastic and pleasant eating, not 
clammy like half-baked bread. 

1 pound of light dough. 

6 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

6 yolks and 1 whole egg. 

Ila'f cup of milk. 

Flavoring as indicated below. 

1^ pounds of flour. 

If for afternoon tea, take the dough from the 
breakfast rolls, and six hours before the rusks are 
wanted place it in a pan with the bulter, sugar and 
cream. Let all get warmed through and the butter 
softened, then mix them thoroughly. Next add the 
eg s and flour by littles, alternately, beating the 
mixture up against the side of the pan, to make it 
smooth and elastic. Spread the last handful of 
flour on the table, knead the dough as for rolls, 
pressing and spreading it out with the knuckles, 
and folding it over repeatedly. Set it in a warm 
placefjr2or 3 hours. Then knead it the sec- 
ond time. Every time the dough is doubled on it- 
self the two edges should be pressed together first. 
When the dough of this and of the brioche receipt is 
good and finished it looks sil'ay, and air will snap 
from the edg^ when it is p-nched. After this !•»■

tmd kneading the dough should stand an hour and 
then be kneaded once more and made into shapes

is perhaps the best for these. Do not brush over

A little flavoring may be added ia the dough ; 
either vanilla extract, vanilla and rose mixed, or- 
ange or nutmeg ; but for a nice variation grate in the 
rind of one or two lemons and squeeze in some of 
thejuice. 



If to be made overnight without light dough for a 
start, all the ingredients can be mixed at once bj 
taking a pint of yeast and half pint of milk — or 
nearly all yeast — adding ail the other articles atd 
flour to make soft dough. 



6Y1. 



French Sweet Rusks. 



Best Every-day Sort. 



2 pounds of light dough. 

4 ounces of sugar. 

4 ounces of butter. 

4 yolks of eggs. 

Large half cup of milk. 

Flour to make it soft dough. 



5TS. English, or Hot Cross Buns. 

1 pint of "liquor" — being half yeast, half water or 
mlk. 

1 teasjTOonful of salt. 
4 ounces of sugar. 

4 ounces of butter, melted. 

2 eggs— or 4 yolks, better. 
Nutmeg or other extract. 
Flour to mal,e s( ft, dough. 

Mix up everything at once. Manage according 
to extended directions f r rusks. Make into round 
balls flattened. Brush over with syrup when done. 

But then rusks will still be dry rusks or "tops and 
bottoms," according to some understandings of the 
term, and hotel pastry cooks are often called on to 
make them at pleasuring places,for wine parties, and 
fur ou'-door occasions. 



5Y3. 



Brussels Rusks. 



Take, for preference, the dough made by the re- 
eaipt for rusks designated as the best every day 
sort, and when finished make it ii long loaves and 
bake in tin moulds of bric'i shape. When a day 
old sllct these and brown the slices in the oven. 



Brioche dough is used in the same manner as the 
above, and also with carraway seeds mixed in. A 
teaspoonful does. 



5T4. 



Marlborough Rusks. 



Make the one pound common sponge mixture — it 
has already been twice given in the book of pud- 
dings—and add thereto one ounce of carraway seeds 
Rake in long, narrow moulds. When a day old 
slice, a d brown the slices in the oven. These 
crisped slices can be kept a long ) ime, and serve 
much the same purpose as sweet crackers. 

575. Russian Wine Rusks. 



This and the next succeeding kind want the same 
skill in making that sponge cake d . es. 1 hey belong 
properly to the department of cakes, and may be 
used as such as well as in the form of dry rusks. 

14 ounces of granulated sugar. 

12 eggs. 

8 ounces of almonds. 
8 ounces of unbolted flour. 
1 teaspoonful of almond extract. 

Cru>h the almonds with the rolling-pin on the ta- 
ble without removing the s' ins, and then mix them 
with the half pound of graham flour — which should 
have the coarsest bran sifted away from it before 
weighing. Beat the sugar and eggs together in a 
cool p'ace about half an hour. When perfectly 
light acd thick sfir ia the flavoring and the flour 
and almonds. Bake in long, narrow moulds. Slice, 
and brown the slices ia the oven. 



5TO. 



Anisette Rusks. 



8 ounces of granulated sugar. 
10 eggs. 

4 ounces of alnoonds. 

6 ounces of flour. 

A quarter ounce of anise seed. 
Mince the almonds as fine as possible, and without 
taking ofl* the skins. Mix them and the anise seed 
with the flour dry. Then beat the sugar and eggs 
quite light, as for sponge cake, and lightly stir in 
the flour, etc. Bake in long and narrow moulds, 
and when a day old slice, and brown the slices on 
both sides in the oven. 

Muffins, Waffles, Gaufres, Flapjaok» 

At last, to be sure, Mr. Warri-igton burst into a 
loud laugh. It was when the poor chaplain, after 
a sufficient discus^sion of muffins, eggs, tea, the news, 
the theaires, and S) forth, pulled out a schedule of 
his debts — Thackeray' s Virginisaiu.

5TT. Englisli Comraon Muffins. 

Baked in rings on a huge griddle and carried 
around lo customers, from the shops. Simply a 
common bread sponge of the cheapest, the muffins 
being puled apart and toasted, almost invariably, 
before they are eaten. 

2 pounds of flour. 

1 quart of mixed water and yeast. 

1 tablespoonful of salt. 

Mix the above together carefully, to have no lumps 
in it, at mon. The water should be warm and the 
sponge set to rise in a warm place. At about 3 
beat the sponge thoroughly, and the longer the bet- 
ter, with spoon or paddle, and let rise again. Beat 
up again before using. Set tin ring^ the size of 
saucers on the griddle, half fill them wi h the batter, 
let bake light b-own on the bottom, then turn them 
over and bake the other side. The batter should be 
thicker than for pancakes and thinner than frit- 
ters. 



The preceding being the cheapest made for sale, 
private parties make richer qualities with milk and 
a little shortening. 

The Boston muffin man had a name for some kind 
of a hot breakfast and tea cake which the great 
word-catcher dictionaries have failed to rake in. 
The word was pyflit; his painted sign read "Muffins, 

Py flits, Oatcakes, Goff^ers, Made Here by ." 

His place was a red brick, private house on Li- 
quorpond street — of course everybody knows Li- 
quorpond street, Boston — it leads into High street 
on the north and the Witham river runs at the back 
of the old brick stores on the further side of that, 
and the river itself is as lively as a street when the 
tide is up, although its channel to the sea is only 
maintained by means of bundles of wicker stuff, 
like the Mississippi jetties. The muffin man used 
to start out punctual to the moment, morning and 
evening, and cry "muffins and py flits"— and them 
only, so his literary customers must have known 
what "pyflits" meant. In that they had the advan- 
tage of these columns. In saying literary custo- 
mers we only give honor where honor is due, for 
Boston has always been famous for literature and 
good hotels. The Roberts Brothers were located in 
Narrow Bargate, opposite the "Red Lion Inn " 



They used to issue a compendium with their alma- 
nac, and tried to p'ease the Middlemarch [ eople and 
"I'ly over" John Noble, the other bok eller, by 
leaving out the horse-doctoring matter and s gns of 
Zodiac, and putting in fine pictures from the art 
union instead. These Roberts', strikln r into a new 
path right through the fences of old custom, were 
both young men. But of the hotels, the "Peacock" 
was the one patronized by the American travellers. 
(Hawthorne's England and Italy.) The "Rei 
Lion" was frequented, principally, by "Cripps, the 
Gamer," and the "White Hart" by the farmers, and 
the "White Horse" by market people. Boston stee- 
ple, that most remarkable landmark, towers, an 
architectural glory, into the world of rooks t nd 
crows, three hundred feet above these all. It can 
be seen thirty miles out at sea, and from Lincoln 
Minster, thirty miles the other way. But of course 
every Bostonian knows of the presence of this great 
tower, although he may never raise hia eyes to look 
at it so common, nor care to remember old John Cot 
ton, the preacher. Bat the Boston muffia man with 
his mysterious py flits, not to be found ia the una 
bridged, was an object of more immediate interest. 
The people "off the Skelligs," and John Halifax, 
Getit, should know whatpyfli'S are, but as for us we 
can only jump to the mild guess that they must have 
been crumpets under an ancient name.

Cheapest Yeast- Raised Batter Cakes 

Without Eggs 



English Crumpets. 

1^ pounds of flour. 

1 quart of warm water. 

1 cupful of yeast. 

1 basting-spoonful of melted lard. 

1 *• " of syrup 

1 small teaspoouful of salt 

Mix all the ingredients together like netting sponge 
for bread — with very cold water if made over night 
for breakfast, or else 6 hours before the meal with 
warm. Beat thoroughly both at time of mixing and 
just before baking. 

Such cakes as these, baked rather dry and not too 
thin, are made and sold in shops which have no 
other business but these and muffins in all the 
cities. 

The "crumpets" are commonly toasted in their 
native lands.

An hour before the^meal add the enriching ingredi- 
ents and beat well,

Baking Powder Batter Cakes. 

Mix up, just before the cakes are wanted as in the 
preceding receipt, but without yeast. Just bafore 
you begin to bake add two or three large teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder, take the large wire egg 
whisk and beat the batter thoroughly — a vast im- 
provement. 

Hotel cooks probably have dififerent estimates of 
the public likes and dislikes from other and domes 
tic peoples*. Their opportunities are dififerent. The 
conditions are dififerent. The restraints are re- 
moved from the people who eat, and they indulge 
their tastes without the hindrances of economic 
considerations. The cooks know no individuals, 
but as the tide comes and goes they learn what the 
tide of humanity likes to consume the most of For 
instance, one favorite article which is not found half 
often enough is graham cakes. 



581. 



Graham Batter Cakes. 



1 pound of graham flour, not sifted. 
1 pound of white flour. 
1 quart of warm water. 

1 cupful of yeast. 

2 eggs. Salt. 

*2 ounces of syrup. 

2 ounces of melted lard. 

Set the batter as a sponge like other yeast-raised 
cakes, either over night or 6 hours before supper, 
and add the enriching ingredients an hour before 
baking. 

And, anything for a change, sometimes your peo- 
ple take streaks, and the prevailing fashion is fo 
rice cakes. 



583. 



Rice Batter Cakes. 



One heaping cofifee cup of raw rice makes the fol 
lowing quantity: 

1 quart of cooked rice. 
1^ pints of m'lk. 
1 pound, or quart, of flour. 
1 basting-spoonful of syrup. 
4 to 6 eggs. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

2 " " baking powder. 

Mash the dry-cooked rice in a pan with a little of 
the milk, which should be warm, (ill there are no 
lumps left, then add flour and milk alternately, keep- 
ing it firm enough to work smooth. Add the other 
ingredients and beat well. Buttermilk and soda 
can be used if desired, instead of powder and sweet 
nulk.

Remove all the dark crust from the bread, and 
then soak it in a quart of the water several hours, 
with a plate to press it under. Mash smooth and 
add the flour, the pint of milk or waer, eggs and 
powder. It always improves batter cakes to beat 
the eggs light, before mixing them in. No shorten- 
ing nor syrup needed for the above.

Corn cakes will be found, with other preparations

Speaking of the way the English mis-call things, 
there is a very pretty London cook book malting the 
remark that something in the batter cake line is 
baked J|on a "girdle" in Scotland, where "gird- 
les" are in common use, but as they are itlle 
known in England the cake must be baked on the 
stove plate. The idea of calling a griddle a girdle 1 
The griddle is in common use in New Jersey, but is 
little known in York State. And if no griddles in 
England what do they do for buckwheat cakes ? 
Dreadful supposition — perhaps they have none 1 
Time for somebody to start American kitchens over 
there. So that is the reason why Scotland is apos- 
trophized as 

"Land o' cakes I and John o'Groates," 
And barley bannocks; and England is not honored 
wiih any such title — how can she be, with no ''gird- 
les ', What is home without a "girdle ?" Her 
people are emigrating. 



585. 



Buck-wheat Cakes. 



2 pounds of buckwheat flour. 

2 quarts of water. 

1 cupful of yeast. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 large basting-spoonful of syrup. 

1 " " " of melted lard. 

Make a sponge or bat'er, overnight, with the 
warm water, yeast and flour. In the morning add 
the enriching ingredients, beat up well and bake 
thin cakes oq a griddle 

The great mgority of people prefer buckwheat 
cakes with about a fifth part corn meal mixed with 
the buckwheat. And twice as much shortening as 
above will please them better. No eggs need ever 



THE AMEBIOAN PASTBT COOK. 



145 



be used with buckwheat. 



After the first mixing with yeast some of the bat- 
ter may be saved and used instead of yeast for seve- 
ral succeeding days. A teaspoon ful of carbonate of 
soda may then be needed to bg mixed in the batter 
n the morning, but cakes made that way, for some 
reason, are more palatable than with sweet yeast — 
care being taken to proportion the soda to the de- 
gree of slight sourness. 

The neatest way to grease the cake griddle is with 
a piece of ham rind cut oflflargefor the purpose, and 
the batter should be poured from a pitcher, or a can 
having a coflFee pot spout. 

Where the smoke and smell is an objection the 
cakes can be baked just as well without grease, not 
only on soapstone griddles but on iron ones as well, 
if they be rubbed with a cloth after every baking, to 
keep them polished. We do not insist on the adop 
tion of the cleaner plan, because cakes half fried 
are eaten tv ith a better relish than the others — and 
hotel cooks are not expected to be reformers. 

68T. 

Goffers are gaufres, and they are wafers, or thin 
cakes, whence waflles, which are, or used to be, 
called also soft wafers. But thin cakes were of more 
than one sort. Almond gaufres and some others 
are a kind of candy cakes, thin and crisp. Flemish 
gaufres are our waffles, but made so rich that they 
are used as a pastry dish for dinner with jellies and 
marmalades. They are also used in all their rich- 
ness for breakfast, where expense is no object, but 
can hardly come under the head of breakfast bread 
in ordinary. The next receipt is the happy mean 
which just suits.

Hotel Waffles. 



3 pounds of flour. 

3 pints of milk or water. 

1 pint of yeast. 

6 ounces of sugar or syrup, 

8 ounces of melted lard or butter.

enriching ingredients, beat up well.andlet rise again 
till 6, then bake in waffle irons.

Waffles for Early Breakfast. 

The waffle batter of the foregoing can be set over 
night with cold water, but it saves making a sepa- 
rate sponge when there ^is roll dough ready in the 
morning to take 2 pounds of the dough and work in 
the butter melted and a little of the milk made 
warm. Let stand a few minutes, then beat smooth,

As a rule, for those who would excel, it is well to 

remember that white of eggs makes waffles and pan- 
cakes tough and leathery unless added in the form 
of froth, which cirries fine air bubbles into the bat- 
ter. When not so beaten the cakes will be belter 
with the whiles left out altogether and powder used 
instead, along with the yolks which alone give the 
richness. Just such fine distinctions as these well 
observed make the diflFerence betwixt fine cooks and 
those who loaf, out of employment, on street cor- 



Baking Waffles. 



594. 



Waffles, it must be owned, are the terror of hotel 
cooks in ordinary positions, chiefly because people 
will persist in laking waffles just before they begin 
the me«il, waffles for the meal, and more waffles just 
after the meal, making nine hundred orders of 
waffles for three hundred persons. But as waffles 
make a house popular and are a means of distanc- 
ing competition hotel stewards and proprietors often 
find it good policy to look upon waffles without 
prejudice, and provide for their extensive manufac 
ture by furnishing the proper waffle range, thus 
gaving a hand and no end of confusion, waste, 
smoke, inconvenience, profanity and disappoint- 
ment. Of course this applies to large business. A 
stove and the common waffle irons may do very well 
for fifty persons — the guage of these receipts. 

Sweet waffles burn so easily that they cannot be 
baked fast. When waffles do not brown fast enough 
add lugar or syrup. The only remedy for waffles 
sticking to the irons is to keep the irons in constant 
use with scraping and rubbing out with lard while 
hot, and avoid letting them burn with nothing in 
them. To bake waffles, pour in one side a spoonful 
of melted lard, shut up and turn over the iron two 
or three times and then place a spoonful of batter 
in each compartment. Shut and turn over to the 
fire frequently till both sides are brown. 



595. 



Rioe Waffles. 



1 quart of dry cooked rice, 

IJ pints of milk. 

1 pound of flour. 

4 eegs. Salt. 

10 yolks. 

1 basting-spoonful of butter. 

1 " ** of syrup. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Mash the rice with the milk, mix up like rice 
batter cakes. 



But to divert attention from waffles it is only 



necessary to announce clam pancakes. And surely 
they are a Yankee invention and of local fame only 
at that, for nowhere in print, not even on clam can- 
labels can such a dish apparently be found. This 
is the route by which clam pancakes have reached 
these columns: A number of pleasure-seeking peo- 
ple occupying the broad piazza and the hundred rus- 
tic chairs at a hotel in the shadow of Pikes Peak, 
between dancing and promenading and the pause in 
the music got to talking about the sea-side and per 
consequence about clams. There was one among 
them who had travelled on the staff of the Grand 
Duke Alexis, and speaking of various persons' likes 
and preferences it came at last to "0, clams plain are 
all very well, clam fritters, clam stew, clam patties, 
but leaving out chowder there is nothing made of 
clams equal to our Yankee clam pancakes". 

"Why cant we have them here?" 

"Why of course we can." 

It is (rue Pikes Peak is a long way from Glamdom 
but canned clams do very well. The cook had to be 
instructed, and after that still ventured to ask 
"What do you eat with them?*' "Butter and syrup, 
just like any the other batter cakes," 



596. 



Olam Panoakes. 



2 cans of clams (2 lb. size). 

1 pound of flour. 

1 pint of the clam liquor 

1 pint of milk. Salt. 

10 yolks of eggs. 

4 ounces of butter, melted. 

A spoonful of syrup. 

1 heaping teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Cut or chop the clams a little larger than beans. 
Mix the batter as for other batter cakes, add the 
clams at last, and bake on a griddle. 

There is a biographical dictionary across the 
street, but no use looking in that for Sally Lunn. 
Who was she? A muffin peddler? Some common 
body, else she would not have been called Sally. 
Perhaps a female "good fellow," who invitf d folks 
to take a cup o' tea. Maybe a vi lage Hampden or 
a Howard, or a female Cromwell guiltless of any- 
body's blood, yet a great backbiter. But "no fur- 
ther seek her merits to disclose;" she might turn 
out to have been like a certain Aunt Melissy of 
Pennsylvania, recently sketched in a magazine, whe 
kept boarders, was famous for her savory pot-pies 
and doughnuts, but who sold whiskey and swore 
terrifically.

ters. 

Rise 3 hours. Beat again. Divide in four pie pans. 
Rise half an hour. Bake about 15 minutes. They brown 
very easily; are not so good when allowed to become 
too light ; should be brushed over with good butter 
when done. Cut in pieces like pie, but carefully, 
with up and down strokes of a sharp kni'"e, as it 
spoils the cakes to crush them with a heavy cut. 
Should be baked at intervals as the meal goes on, 
and not svseated in the pans. 



The next, and last in this division, are presented 
as something of a specialty in breakfast breads 
They have been very frequently complimented, 
(always remembering that nothing can quite sup- 
plant fine French split rolls) and once I heard thi-: 

•«We have penetrated behind the scenes to see if 
we can discover what pariicular trick it is that 
makes these muffins so delicate, so fine and elastic 

and like a sponge. We have boarded in the G 

House at Louisville, the B House at Cincinnati, 

the B House at Indianapolis," (these remarks 

were made several years ago) "but never met with 
any to equal these." 

"We use here the finest flour, perhaps that's the 
reason." 

"No, it isn't. So they do there, and have the best 
of pastrycooks, too." 

"Perhaps you come to breakfast here at season- 
able hours when the muffins are fresh baked and 
hot." 

"No, it is in the muffins themselves and the way 
you make them." 

Perhaps they had been used to regard hotel muf- 
fins as dry, little, unpalateable things that would 
grease the fingers to touch. The receipt for the sort 
which they esteemed so much better is here given, 
but that is not all. As was remarked about milk bread, 
butter rusks, sweet rusks and waffles the thorough 
beating properly performed with a cutting-under 
motion, so as to inclose air in the batter, is quite es- 
sential to insure fine quality.

2} pounds of light bread dough. 
4 ounces of but'er, melted.

6 yolks and 1 whole egg. 
2 teaspoonfuls of sugar. 
4 ounces of flour. 
Little salt. 



Take the dough from the breakfast bread at 5 in 
the morning If French roll dough no sugir need 
be added. Work (he butter and milk in, arid set in 
a warm place a few minutes. Then beat in the eggs 
and flour and keep beating a^inst the side of the 
pan till the batter is very elastic and smooth. Rise 
awhile. 

The tin muffin rings ehould be two inches across 
and one inch deep. Set them on a buttered baking 
pan, half fill with thebatfer — which should be thin 
enough to settle smooth, and thick enough not to 
run — let rise half an hour, bake about ten minutes 
in a hot oven. Bake small lots at intervals during 
the breakfast. 

599. MuflBlns from the Beginningf. 



When no other kind is made and there is no

1^ pounds of flour, 

1 pint of "liquor" — milk and yeast mixed. 

Make a soft dough of the above over night and 
add the ingredients of the preceding receipt except 
the flour. Beat up well in the morning. 

Sugar in small quantities makes bread crust 
paper-like, ( hin and soft. Too much makes bread 
puddingy. Yolk of eggs counteracts sugar, and 
dries the bread out, also makes the crust crisp and 
brittle. White of egg makes thick, tough crust 
like leather that has been wet and dried. Shorten- 
ing makes little difference besides lessening the 
stringiness of well-made bread. Sweet rusks and 
cakes are slow to rise and slow to bake. Such bread 
as muffins and Sally Lunn usually rises too fast and 
too much.

About Baking Powder, and How Not 

to Use It. 



Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there 
shall be no more cakes and ale ? — Twelfth Night. 

After all that has been shown of the manner of 
making the best of bread without baking powder, it 
must be plain to see that the way to avoid the inju- 
ries arising from baking powder adulteration is to 
use good yeast instead. The use of powder does not 
need tobeetiCouraged, it, like many other non-es- 
sential articles, is good in its place, but it is the 
lazy cook's resort; it tends to inferiority in cooking; 
it causes an expenditure of money for that which is 
not nutriment but which at its ver7 best is but empty 
air and at its worst carries after the air a residue of 
poison. And yet baking powder is good to a certain 
degree. But how few can make bakiog powder 
bread anything but a sorry substitute for bread ? 
In the mining and lumbering regions and such haif- 
civilized places where men in haste and carelessness 
mix up a sort of biscuit, any way for the easiest, bak- 



:48 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



ing powder is used in such vast quantities as people 
who liye where cooking is done might find impossi 
ble to believe. That its manufacture must be 
ijery profitable is shown in many ways; by the im- 
mense number of diflferent brands, the number of 
new and expensive ways of putting it up in pack- 
ages, and of employing agents, traveling equipments 
and printing and advertising, equaling the sewicg 
machine business of patent times, or patent medicine 
business of all times, and this without any monopoly 
for any one. Besides the immense factories of the 
large cities most of the small cities and outfitting 
points of the west have firms engaged in the manu- 
facture. Kansas City has one, Denver has two, and 
of these one alone advertises that it ships from three 
to four tons of powder per month to the mountain 
towns. At the same time car loads are arriving of 
perhaps forty different brands from the east. 



Baking powder was first extensively advertised 
for sale and generally introduced about the years 
1845 to 1860. Flaming posters appeared in all the 
towns calling it German yeast, or baking powder, 
claiming that a yield of about twenty pounds more 
bread from a barrel of flour could be had by its use 
than by yeast raising, on the ground that ordinary 
yeast changes a portion of the flour into air in fer- 
mentation, and claiming for powder the effect of 
eggs, and another saving. Chemists certificates 
were appended to say that the powder when evapo- 
rated in the bread left only an extremely small re- 
mainder, and that was but chloride of sodium, or 
common salt, and no disadvantage. 



Supposing the last to be true, it is on the pre- 
sumption that either cream of tartar or tortaric acid 
are used in making the powder, and that they are so 
perfectly proportioned as to exactly counteract each 
other and banish each other in the form of air, frum 
the bread. Otherwise a residue of one or other 
must remain, and other acids and alkalis may be 
used having the same or stronger eff"ects but leaving 
still more harmful remiinders. Both before and 
after the introduction of commercial baking powders 
pastry cooks used to make their own. But cream 
of tartar was found most unreliable because of lack 
of uniformity in its adulteration. Some samples 
would contain so much starch or worse matters that 
four teaspoonfuls were required to counteract one 
teaspoonful of soda. With tartaric acid ready pow- 
dered the same difficulty was experienced. Tartaric 
acid in crystals, powdered in a mortar at home as 
wanted, was the only reliable recourse to avoid hav- 
ing biscuit spoiled either one way or the other. The 
proportions are one teaspoonful of powdered tartaric 
acid to two of carbonate of soda — the reverse of 
cream of tartar proportioned. The Scientific Ameri- 
can has published a number of different formulas for 
making baking powders. Many of the manufactur- 



ers accuse others of employing cheap but injurious 
substitutes f r soda and acid, and here is a hint of 
another kind of deterioration. 

A man came around a new western town offering 
to sell a receipt for making baking powder which 
was to effect a great saving to all consumers. The 
price asked for the precious bit of information was 
one dollar. When my turn came to be canvassed I 
told him that knowing of quite a number of baking 
powder mixtures already I had just fifty cents worth 
of curiostiy left to know what he had to impart. So 
for that sum 1 obtained the following : 



EUREKA BAKING POWDEE. 



Bi-carbonate of soda, 16 ounces; tartaric acid, 12 
ounces; cream of tartar, 2 ounces; fine flour 3 
pounds. 

There is two pounds of real baking powder and 
flour enough added to make five pounds weight. 
Starch has more the appearance of real baking 
powder than flour. Does not this go far to explain 
the variations in strength and the inducements to 
push the sale of cheap powders? Cost price of 
flour, 4 cents; starch, 10 cents; selling price of pow- 
der the difference. 

OOl. 

It being our sole business to teach how to make 
good bread and to inquire into the nature of the ob- 
stacles that throw us, we have no remedies to offer 
against these adulterations other than the first men- 
tioned, viz: to use little or none at all, and employ 
good yeast instead. In the palmy days of French 
cookery, when culiLary excellence was carried, un- 
der the auspices of fashion, to an extreme never sur- 
passed since, baking powder was unknown, and the 
bakers' more objectionable carbonate of ammonia 
was unthought of. The finest cakes were made 
light either with brewer's yeast, like those at th^ 
end of this book; with air beaten ia mechanically, 
like our common sponge cakes; or with the fine parti- 
cles of cold butter as in pound cake — the same agent 
that imparts such extreme lightness to puff- paste. 
Waffles and pan cakes at the same time were made 
of extreme delicacy by means of white of eggs whip- 
ped to a froth, being really a mass of air bubbles, 
fine as snow, incorporated in the mixture, there to 
expand in the heat of baking and raise the whole. 

Baking powder is the cook's labor-saving friend, 
but if the friend be treacherous ar.d unreliable shall 
we not accept his good offices with caution ? All we 
can gain from him ia gas to expand into big ho'es in 
the bread in the oven, and a teaspoonful of soda to 
a pint of £0ur buttermilk yields the same. Ia "old 
fashioned" gingerbread a teaspoonful of soda added 
to the raw molasses makes a gassy foam just the 
and, independent of all the half dosen ways 



THE AMEBIOAN PASTRY COOK.

already fihown of introducing air for lightnesa into 
food compounds, there is the purely mechanical 
utilization of atmospheric air of the following 
method. 



60S, Virginia Beaten Biscuit. 



Old-Fashioned "Way. 



There has to be a maul, or Indian club over 2 
feet long, and a stout table, for the beating. The 
biscuit will not be right unless you have the maul 
made of hard maple, square-shaped at the heavy 
end, but waving, so as to make uneven hollows in 
the dough and a hole in the handle for a string to 
hang it up by. 

3 pounds of flour. 

1 large teaspoonful of salt. 

4 ounces of butter or lard. 
8 cups of milk or water. 

Have the milk tepid, mix the melted butter and 
ealt wiih it, and wet up the flour — nearly all — into 
8 .ft duugh. Knead it to smoothness on the table, 
and then beat it out to a sheet with the maul, fold 
it over on itself and beat out again. 

There is no established limit to the times the 
dough may b9 beaten out, but after a few times it 
begins to break instead of spread. This injures it, 
and an interval should be allowed for the dough to 
lose its toughness. The air in the hollows beaten 
into the dough makes it very light, and white and 
flaky 



Modern innovators on the preceding practice add 
a teaspoonful of soda sifted into the fl jur and mix 
up with buttermilk, beating besides in the regular 
manner. 



There are few things more generally aceptable 
in some localities than beaten biscuit rolled out very 
thin and fried. 



So that if baking powder were banished from the 
culinary world for the sins of its makers there 
would still be cakes and ale as of old. If we may 
believe the advertisements there is one brand of 
powder that is pure and honest, but is not that re- 
ducing our means of safety to a very slender plank? 
For if by any accident a little of some other powder 
should get mixed wifh that one there would be a 
terrible state of affairs ! 



Baking Po-wder Bread. 



He found her presiding over the tea and coflFee, 
the table loaded with warm bread, both of flour, 
oatmeal, and barley-meal, in the shape of loaves, 
cakes, Mscuits, and other varieties, together with 
eggs, reindeer ham, mutton and beef ditto, smoked 
salmon, marmalade, and all other delicacies which 



induced even Johnson himself to extol the luxury of 
a Scotch breakfast above that of all other countries. 
A mess of oatmeal porridge, flanked by a silver jug, 
which held an equal mixture of cream and butter- 
milk, was placed for the Baron's share of this re- 
past. — Waverly — Chap. XII, 

I could write a better book of cookery than has 
ever yet been written ; it should be a book on philo- 
sophical principles. — Dr. Johnson. 



603. Baking Powder Biscuit. 

2 pounds or quarts of flour. 

4 ounces of melted lard or butter. 

4 teasroonfuls of powder. 

1 « of salt. 

1^ pints of tepid water or milk. 

Mix the powder in the flour dry. Place the melt- 
ed lard in a hollow in the middle, the salt and water 
or milk with that, and stir around, drawing the flour 
in gradually so as to make a smoo'h, soft d -ugh. 
Turn out on the floured table. Press the dough 
out flat with the hands, fold it over again and eg in 
and press out till it is compact, even, and smooth. 
Let stand 5 minutes. Roll out and cut into biscuits. 
Bake immediately. 



Of all the atrocious frauds in the way of bread 
perhaps the worst is the baking-powder biscuit of 
unskillful cooks, sometimes found iu boarding hous- 
es and low-priced restaurants. The compulsory 
spoiling of biscuit through excessive economy of in- 
gredients may be pardonable in the cooks, but the 
atrocity of spoiling them with too much richness 
and wrong way of working, never. Such biscuit 
are yellow, dirty on the bottom, greasy to the touch; 
they have rough sides, no edges, for they rise tall 
and narrowing towards the top ; they are wrinkled 
and freckled and ugly ; they will not part into white 
and eatable flakes or slices, but tumble in brittle 
crumbs from the fingers, and eat like smoked saw- 
dust. Strange, that the same materials should make 
things so diflferent as these and good biscuit. 



Biscuit dough should be made up soft. The short- 
ening should be melted and added to the fluid milk- 
warm, to insure thorough incorporation. 

The private house way of kneading the dough up 
into dumpling shape, perpetually breaking the 
layers and making the parted edges take up too 
much flour, is the wrong way that ruins biscuit. 
The right way is given in the receipt. 



604. Baking Powder Bread. 



Because we in hotels are accustomed to make 
every article as rich as is allowed it should not be 
forgotten that shortening is byno means essential to 
make good biscuit, and the preceding receipt f-^r 
biscuit is just right for loaves of baking powder

Imitation French Rolls, with Baking 

Powder. 



"Vienna Rolls." 

2 pouQds or quarts of flour. 

4 heaping teaspooofuls of powder. 

2 *' " of sugar. 

1 " ♦« of salt. 

4 tablespoonfuls of butter or lard, melted. 

2 yolks of eggs. 

1 large pint of milk. 

See directions for biscuit and make this dough 
flame way. After it has stood a few minutes to lose 
its springiness make into split rolls. Cutting out is 
the qu'ckest, and best for baking powder dough. 
See directions for French rolls. Brush over with 
melted lard in the pans. Let stand 20 minutes to 
rise, if convenient. Bake as usual. 



When a seidlitz, or any eflfervescent powder is 
dropped into a glass of water the gas produced rush- 
es to the top and immediately escapes, but if a por- 
tion of a raw egg be mixed in the water first, or 
some dissolved gum arable, it catches and holds the 
gas on top in the form of froth, as in soda syrups. 
The same effect in some degree is observable when 
an egg is mixed in baking-powder bread. A film is 
formed that hold^ the air, the dough may be allow- 
ed a few minutes to become lighter, and the rolls 
are more spongy than if made without. 

Repetition, if odious to the thorough reader, is 
unavoidable in a cook book, where people seeking 
but one article will overlook all else. 



GOO. ow Flake Rolls or Biscuit. 



Another way of using powder by working it into 
the dough. Worth practicing. Very white. 
2 pounds or quarts of flour. 
4 heaping teaspoonfuls of powder. 

1 do do of salt. 

2 basting-spoonfuls of melted lard. 
1 large pint of milk. 

Mix up like biscuit but only put in a fourth part 
of the powder. Mix the rest with a handful of 
flour and sprinkle it over the dough every time that 
it is pressed out to a sheet. Knead long and well. 
Let stand awhile. Gut out thin. They rise. 

OOT. Buttermilk Sweet Rolls. 



Cheap and off-hand. Often made at stage stations 
&nd village inns. 
2 pounds of flour. 

2 teaspoonfuls of carbonate of soda. 
4 ounces of butter. 
4 ounces of sugar. Salt, 
2 eggs and 2 yolks more. 
1 large pint of buttermilk. 



Sift the soda in the flour. Mix all the other arti* 
cles with the buttermilk. Make up like biscuit or 
Vienna rolls. Glaze or sugar over when baked. 



The yellow specks in the crust for which the soda 
is blamed are oftener due to the particles of curd of 
sour milk, which brown quickly in the oven. If 
you use "clabber," pass it through a seive first.

While endeavoring to observe and respect the dis- 
tinction between solid instruction and mere opinion 
we must say that the practice of yeast-raised cakes 
ought to be far more general among American pas- 
trycooks and bakers than it is. The dreary repeti- 
tion of middling pound cake and poor sponge cake, 
with a sorry variation or two, might with advantage 
be broken up by the introduction of some of the sorts 
which great cooks of old used to set before the king. 
That was before cooks began to begrudge a little 
work in behalf of excellence. 

In the European countries where they cannot af- 
ford to be so extravagant as we are, when there is 
to be a festival, the first thing the managers do is, 
go to the baker, either buy enough light dough, and 
some notable housekeeper makes it into cheap but 
good cake for the multitude, or else the baker him- 
self gets the contract. In this way plum cake itself 
becomes a cheap treat, while still richer and far 
more delicate varieties are made for the wealthy by 
the same general method with difference of de- 
gree.

It is conceded that some practice is necessary to 
make these cakes perfectly, for the exact time when 
they are ready for the oven can only be known by 
observation. But as far as can be, the directions here 
following will be found eflfectual, and make the prac- 
tice easy. 



600. 



Scotch Seed Cake. 



Takes five hours time to make, raise, and bake, 
using dough to begin with, 

2 pounds of light-bread dough. 
12 ounces of sugar. 
12 ounces of butter. 

4 eggs. 

1 teaspoonful of carraway seeds. 
8 ounces of flour. 

Weigh out the dough at 7 in the morning. Set it 
with the butter and sugar in a warm place. At 
about 9 work all together and beat in the eggs one 
at a time, and add the carraway. Give it another 
half hour to stand and become smooth, then add 
the flour and give the whole ten minutes beating. It 
makes a stiff batter — not dough. 

Put it in two buttered cake moulds. Rise about 
an hour. It should not be too light, bake as you 
would bread, in a slack oven, less than an hour. 

610. 

Cheapest Cake Without Eggs. 

2 pounds of light-bread dough. 
8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of butter. 

1 teaspoonful of carraway seeds. 

1 pound of flour. 

The difference between this and the preceding 
kind is that this makes a soft dough, to be handled 
and kneaded like bread, then baked iu moulds. 
Brush over with a little melted lard when setting to 
rise. 

These raised cakes are like fresh bread, cannot 
be sliced till a day or two old, without waste. 

Once upon a time, so they say, an economical man 
fitted out his cow with a pair of green glass specta 
cles, and thus induced her to eat shavings, which 
looked like hay. 

In the warm, moist gardens of the south of Eng- 
land the camomile flowers make pretty borders, and 
saffron grows like a weed. An infusion of saffron 
gives the color of eggs to cake, and the people who 
are glad there to sell their new-laid eggs are very 
well content with the substitute. 

Perhaps saffron also gives something of the taste 
of eggs. Italian vermicelli is colored with it. 

611. Cornish Saffron Cake. 

The miner's dinner-pail cake in the region of 
Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains, as well as 
Penzance and Lands End. 

2 pounds of light dough. 



6 ounces of sugar. 
8 ounces of butter or poultry fat. 
8 ounces of dried cherries, or raisins. 
Half cup of strong saffron tea. 
1 pound of flour. 

Mix up like Scotch seed cal^e, manage and bake 
same as bread. One or two eggs improves the cake. 



61;^. 



Election Cake. 



Make the Scotch seed cake but with 1 pound of 
seeded or seedless raisins and half cupful of brandy 
and flavorings, and omit the carraway seeds. 



613. Polish Cake. Baba. 

Requires 5 hours time to make, raise and bake. 

1 pound of good, light roll dough. 

IJ pounds of butter. 

6 ounces of sugar. 
14 eggs. 

1 pound of flour. 

8 ounces of raisins. 

6 ounces of currants. 

4 ounces of citron. 

Half cup of brandy. 

Lemon and nutmeg extracts. 

These cakes made with dough are all started alike. 
Warm the dough, butter and sugar together, mix 
and then set away half an hour, when the ingredi- 
ents can be mixed better; then beat iu the eggs two 
at a time and handfuls of flour alternately. Beat 
well; rise 2 hours. Beat again, add the flavorings, 
brandy and fruit. Line the cake moulds with but- 
tered paper. Let the batter rise in the moulds 
about 2 hours, then bake, about an hour.

Savarin Cake. 



The preceding without the fruit. Used hot as a 
cake pudding with liqueur sauce. With dough from 
the breakfast rolls at 7 o'clock it can be made ready 
for midday dinner, 

A French authority says Kauglauff or Kugeloff, is 
a general name in German for all cakes made with 
yeast. Perhaps the common term "coffee cake" is 
but the attempt of English speaking tongues at 
"Kauglauff." The cheapest and commonest coffee 
cake has been described as a warm bread several 
columns back. We now give two varieties that are 
really rich cakes by the same name. 

615. Q-erman Kauglauff. 



1 pound of light dough. 

1 pound of flour. 

1 pound of butter. 

6 ounces of sugar. 

1 pound of currants. 

8 whole egg3 and 8 yolks. 

Half cup of milk or cream.

Extract of lemon. 

Ground cinnamon. 

Mix up like Polish cake, the cream and currants 
las', and rise in the moulds. 

When d >ne pass a brush dipped in sugar and milk 
over the cakes and dredge them with the ground 
cinnamon mixed with sugar. Use to slice cold. 



616. Vienna Cake or Kauglauff. 



1 pound of light dough, 
22 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of sugar. 
15 eggs. 
20 ounces of flour. 

Half pint of cream. 

Half cup of brandy. 

1 pound of almonds. 

Mix up and beat and raise according to preceding 
directions. Blanch and split the almonds and mix 
half cf them in the cake; use the remainder to 
stick all over the moulds with butter before the 
dough is put in. These mixtures all make the 
dough like fritter batter, just thick enough for al- 
mond«, fruit, etc., not to sink, 

Shrei citron or candied orange peel, pistachio 
nuts and the like are added at option. Sometimes 
the cakes are served hot, separated into layers with 
a sharp knife, and jelly spread between. 

617. Yeast-Raised Plum Cake. 



The slowest to rise. Use the liveliest dough, and 
in win'er it had better be saved overnight and 
m'xed up with the main part of the ingredients; 
add the fruit next morning, and bake after din- 
ner. 

2 p *undg of light bread dough. 

1 pound of black molasses and sugar, mixed. 

1 pound of butter, 

6 eggs. 
12 ouncps of flour. 

1 ounce of mixed ground spices. 

1 J pounds of sredless raisins. 

1 pound of currants. 

8 ounces of citron. 

Brandy, and lemon extract. 

V- arm the dough and all the ingredients slightly. 
Mix well, except the fruit and brandy. Beat the 
batter, aud set to rise in the mixing pan about 3 
hours. Beat again and add the fruit, previously 
floureJ. Line the moulds ^ith buttered paper, 
ha'f fill and set to rise again about 2 hours. Bake 
from one hour to two, according to size. Large 
cakes should have a coating of paper tied outside 
the moulds to protect the crust during the two 
hours baking. 

These cakes should not be turned out of the 
moulds till at least one day old. 



Hotel pastry cooVs wko think yeast-raised cakes 
too teuious, should nevertheless remember that ia 
some peaces no others are believed in, or a-lowed to 
be made, and these are simple enough after a few 
trials to learn the routine. 



To clean seedless raisins, rub the fine stems off" 
them with the hands and some flour mixed in, then 
stir around in a colander till the siftings all go 
through and leave the raisins clean.

Toast and Toasters. 



Excuse me, Tom, but if I have a weakness it is 
for Yarmouth bloaters, anchovy toast, milk, choco- 
late, marmalade, h^t rolls, and reindeer tongue * 
* *. — Leo^ s Tom Burke* 



I have remarked before that not one person in a 
thousand knows how to make good toast. The sim- 
plest dishes seem to be the ones oftenest spoiled. 
If, as is generally done, a thick slice of bread is 
hurriedly exposed to a hot fire, and the exterior of 
the bread is toasted nearly black, * * etc. 
Henderson. 



There, you see, boys and girls, you had better 
make that toast right and not jam it down on the hot 
range top with gnashing of teeth bo savagely. Not 
one in a thousand of you but knows how to make 
toast beautifully,but you have an invincible aversion 
to it; you think a person who will order toast a 
monster, that to be hated needs but to be seen; you 
want to know why such people can't eat all these 
nice hot breads and batter cakes, and you call 
them pet names which it will never do to put in 
print. 

Of course you think it the cook's business to make 
toast, but that depends on circumstances, for toast 
must be n^ade just as it is ordered, and one of the 
cooks is busy broiling beefsteak and h«im to order 
and another is busy dishing up side dishes and fry- 
ing fresh potatoes. Baking cakes and waffles and 
dishing up breads keeps another agoing, eo s me- 
body besides must make the toast. The vegetable 
cook might be hired with the understanding that 
toast making was one of the duties to be performed, 
and would do well at supper, but the two or three 
hours of breakfast is the vegetable cook's busiest 
time. It would not be so hard to make good toast 
if there was a place provided for it when the hotel 
kitchen is furnished and fitted up, but whoever in 
such a case ever thinks of that ? Put it upon the 
cook and he must almost perforce bake the toast by 
panfuls in the oven, but no persons, if they can help 
themselves, will eat that except as milk toast. The 
broiler is full and has no room but for mea's There 
is only the range top left available and that must be 
kept so hot that there is little chance of being able 
to do good baking inside at the same time.

charcoal broiler aside from the meat work would be 
placed in every hotel kitchen at the first, when 
such expenses are not so reluctantly incurred as af- 
ter some time of scrambling along without. 

In hotels where the tcast difficulty is well over- 
come there is ei her an extra hand from some other 
department appointed for the duty, and the t ast 
range or broiler k) work on, or else, in smaller 
houses where the dining room work is not rushing, 
the waiters themselves, preparing a little toast just 
before he doors are opened for a start, are able to 
make it as wanted, and to suit the special orders. 

The best way where there is no special broiler, is 
to provide half a dozen wire hinged oyster broilers 
or toasters and lay them with the bread in them on 
top of the hot range.

Ooncluding Hints. 



Whatsoever thy hand fiudeth to do, do it with all 
thy might. — Ancient Book. 

Things done by halves are never done right. — 
Modern Paraphrase, 

Considering how extensive is the domain of hotel 
cookery there is no likelihood that we shall ever re- 
cur to the items of bread and rolls again, and a few 
omissions in the foregoing matters must be made 
good here. 

The hardest thing to teach the tyro in mixing bread 
is to make the small quantity of dough soft enough 
in warm weather. Fortunately, with large masses the 
labor with s iff dough is so severe that few people 
err that way, but a li'tle in active summer weather 
f rmentation easily takes up too much flour and be- 
comes rough and rotten, and all the instructions in 
the wor d will not help the "pastry" who does not 
know enough to temper the dough a.'cording to the 
weather. In winter when all the materials and tools 
are cold the stiffer the dough the better; in summer 
use les:- yeast and mix soft. 

So in mixing biscuit. I have, before now, when 
training down the rawness of a lot of picked-up 
summer resort help, placed all the ingredients for 
biscuits for the early breakfast of a party of tremen- 
dous trvut fishers, in a pan, and then a baker who 
was a bread baker and nothing else has utterly 
sp.iled them in ihe mixing, making them harder 
than crackers and not half as good. Biscuit should 
be mixed as soft as fritter batter, so that when the 
scrapings (-f the'pan in flour and scr ps of doa^h are 
added ii can eti'.l be pressed out easily wih the flat 
hands till worked smooth. Whenever your biscuit 
dough is S-) tough that the doubled fists must be 
used ; press it out, conclude that you have made 
the common mistake, and have something yet to 
learn aboui mixing biscuit. 



Mould out your dough for rolls in little round 



hill". Easier said than done. The beginner takes 
the pieces of dough in hand but they won't roll, but 
skate a'l over the table instead. You must brush 
away the flnur, have the table so that the rolls wiU 
almost s iek to it, very slightly dust your hands 
with flour, take two fresh, moist pieces and roll 
them under the hands with a slight pressure. The 
ball of the thumb draws the outside of the dough to- 
wards the palm and makes a smooth ball. Of course 
you must mould two at once, using both hands, else 
you will never get ready for breakfast. Expert 
hands seldom stop to cut off the little pieces of 
dough; they can grab the right sized pieces for rolls 
from the lump with both hands, as quick as wink- 
ing. Vou injure the dough by much moulding. 
The quicker you can get a smooth outside the bet- 
ter. 



Brush your hot loaves from the oven with water, 
They are going to shrink as they cool, and if the 
crust will not give, the crumb will part inside and 
make broken slices. 



The bakers have a saying that it don't matter how 
you mould up the loaves if you make the dough 
good. But that is only a comparative way of speak- 
ing, and they don't have to slice and toast their 
bread as we do, and see the rough ends and broken 
slices go to waste by the bushel. If the reader will 
turn back to our directions for moulding hotel loaves 
he will find a way that makes loaves as smooth and 
seamless as a watermelon, but it remains to say that 
moulding the loaves round first is done in either of two 
ways. If you are in practice with rolls you can 
mould small loaves with both hands, the same way. 
If not, do as the bakers do with "tin loaves" and 
Vienna bread. The shop bakers like to make loaves 
in tia moulds because they use for that soft dough 
carrying much water, and gaining for them several 
pounds in a barrel of flour. The bread so made is 
moist to cut and to keep and does not crumble. But 
as every loaf will expand in the oven and may open 
at the ends like the gaping shell of a dead oyster, it 
is the business of the moulder to form and fold the 
loaf so that it shall open and rise just where he wills 
it, and nowhere else. 

To mould "tin loaves :" Your dough being prop- 
erly kneaded in layers leave it lying in a rather 
thin sheet. Cut that into the right sized squares for 
loaves. The expert workman makes them a little 
longer one way than the other. Take one of the 
pi ces, press it out with the knuckles, double it, 
mailing a square. Catch the furthest corner with 
the extended fingers atid pull it over, and under the 
wrists, which press it in the middle. Tura the piece 
cf dough under the hands and reach aaother corner. 
Six motions makes a round, smooth loaf with a mid- 
dle depre.sion made by the wrists. 

Now extend this depression lengthwise, forming 
a trough shape by pounding and lengthening the 



164 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



middle with the wrists while pulling over the round- 
ipg side with the fingers. Finally roll over the thick 
uriher side into the hollow middle, the oiher or 
near side forming the top lap to the rolled up loaf, 
and place it iu the brick-shaped mould. Press it 
down slightly in the mould to make square corners. 
This loaf will rise the way the bakers like to see — 
parted on one side, where the seam was left, and 
•howling the whiteness of the inside without a break 
in the bread. 

Our pic-nic loaves described near the beginning 
are called Stollen by the German bakers. This kind 
of sweetened bread is often made richer with addi 
tions of citron, etc. The bakers make up the loaves 
as just described, only doubling the two sides to- 
gether instead of rolling, making a long split roll 
without any brushing with lard at all. 

In addition to the names Kauglauff and Kugeloff 
applied to the varieties of yeast raised cakes, of 
which 5<oZZm is one,Urbain-Dubois spells it Congloff, 
making three authorized ways, all meaning the 
same as Polish Baba, which is a gsneral term for 
raised cakes, and French Savarin which, according 
to Dubois' menus serves to designate several varieties 
of cakes. These things are mentioned as helping 
to throw light on the mysteries of foreign menus^ 
which "our own correspondents" in Europe delight 
to humiliate their Western cousins with. 

Now about moulding French loaves. We have 
been unwilling to poach in the exclusive shop bak- 
er's grounds further than the thoroughness and use- 
fulness aimed at in our book compelled, and will 
only add this; If you wi-h to try a more workman- 
like WJiy than that previously set forth, commence 
as for "iin loaves," with wrists and fingers making 
the piece of dough into a round ball slightly de- 
pressed. Push these aside on a well floured part of 
the table till all are moulded. Make the trough-like 
depression across these with a rolling pin instead of 
the wrists, using plenty of flour, and depressing all 
before folding any. As no lard is used and bakers 
do not cut the loaves, the flour and the incidental 
drying of the dough whi'e waiting, helps the desired 
parting open of the seam when baking. Having 
practised thus far you can double the loaves like 
split rolls— without any greasing — and experiment 
further at your pleasure. 

In a large western city the writer knew a baker 
who sold little French loaves (petits-pains) in quan- 
tities that can best be described as cart loads, and 
he made them almost as just above described. Tak- 
ing the four corners of the little flat pieces of dougb, 
he pressei them with the points of the fingers into 
the midd'e, and with a blow of the edge of the open 
hand made the roU ready for a little rolling pin de- 
pression, making it very long and narrow, then 



pinching up the two thick sides together, slightly 
lapping one upon the other, and without any touch 
tf lard about them, he placed them in pans so that 
when raised and baked they opened out cleft rolls of 
very fine appearance and of flaky texture. 

Practice Makes Perfect. 

Pastry cooks and bakers wishing their French 
rolls to open up tall and lean backwards, only touch 
a streak of melted lard on one side of the depressed 
piece of dough, just where the lips, when the roll is 
doubled, meet, and none on the top. This gives the 
roll a start to open without quite making a split roll 
of it. Different stewards and bosses having diff"erent 
notions about how these things should be it is often 
difficult for a young man, however willing and cap- 
able, to get a foothold with them without the 
knowledge of just such variations of method as the 
above. 

030. 

Sorry there should be such a thing as a warmed 
over roll in the world, but there will always happen 
to be whole pans of the nicest rolls left over, and 
somebody will always want breakfast at four in the 
morning and expect hot bread. The very best way 
to warm over .rolls, so that none but the most criti- 
cal can tell them from fresh baked, is this : Wet a 
clean cloth in clean water — half a flour sack, for 
instance— and wring it out. Lay this over your 
cold rolls and set them in the oven. In about five 
minutes, or when the cloth is dry, the rolls will be 
warmed through and almost as good as new. 

Never, if it can be avoided, let the rolls stay in 
pans over night — it soils the bottom crust. Turn 
them out to dry. 

If your iron pails soil the crust of the steamed 
brown bread, it can be prevented by lining them 
with manilla paper, lightly brushed over with 
melted lard. The loaves come out looking as nice as 
cake. 



By (he-way, we forgot to put the cross mark on 
the hot cross buns. It has no use, however, except 
once a year, on good Friday, to enable British chil- 
dren to make a few pennies by selling them, perpet^ 
uating some old custom, nobody seems to know for 
a certainty what. 

A cross mark cut on the buns as they are placed 
in the pans will remain and show; but if you let the 
buns rise half light enough, then with a choppiug 
knife cut down deep, and let the buns finish rising, 
the depression will remain and make the buns ap- 
pear to be in four parts. 

Those bun-sellers make the **one a-penny-buns" 
a little richer than the *'two-a-penny-buns;" and 
they have to be a little larger, too, or else when the 
one-a-penny-two-a-penny-hot-cross buns are all in a 
basket together, they wouldn't know 'tother from 
which, you know.

TWENTY WAYS OF COOKING OOBN 
621. MEAL. 



"Corn is the most widely cultivated grain in the 
world, with the exception of rice." 

"As to nutritive matter, corn is only exceeded by 
wheat, and lollowed by rice among the leading arti- 
cles of food. Calculated according to the physilogi- 
cal wants of the system, a week's diet for an adult 
would only cost about twenty cents, and, excepting 
split peas, there is nothing approaching corn for 
economy." 

"Even in the United States, where thirty-seven 
million acres are devoted to the culture of Indian 
corn, yielding a total product of thirteen hundred 
million bushels, while the wheat crop of the world 
is only seven hundred and sixty million bushels, we 
only understand the economic value of corn as cattle 
food." 

"In buying wheat flour, the same outlay would 
purchase double the amount of nutriment in Indian 
meal. The prejudice against the use of corn as an 
article of human food is based on ignorance in many 
cases, and on false pride in others. Wheat is most 
agreeable to the taste, and is preferred by a greater 
portion of the human family, or, at least, by those 
who are able to purchase it. While all the world is 
familiar with wheat as an article of food, not one- 
tenth of its population ever heard of Indian corn ex- 
cept as cattle food. It is quite remarkable that not- 
withstanding its acknowledged good qualities and its 
economy, yet it is but little known to the people oi 
those portions of Europe to whom cheap food is an 
absolute necessity ; and even in times of famine it 
has required judicious and persistent governmental 
efforts to induce famishing communities to use it." 
The preceding statements, taken here and there 
from an able statistical article in the Boston Cultiva- 
tor, suggest the conclusion that it would be a good 
thing in a general way, if all people could be led to 
like corn better than wheat. It is our business to 
believe that such a consummation can be reached 
solely through the instrumentality of the cooks ; by 
the more general diflFusion of knowledge of the best 
ways of using corn meal, and encouragement to put 
in those extra careful touches which are needed to 
make even the best receipts thoroughly successful. My 
own experience as a cook warrants the assertion that 
corn bread properly made and carefully baked, can 
be made popular almost anywhere. The small loaf 
that at first finds no takers is presently in demand, 
and then gives place to one of twice or thrice the 
8i?e, a proportionate amount of wheat bread being 
thereby displaced. 

That an entire community, state or nation may 
have a real preference for corn over wheat bread, is 
shown by the fact of the matter in the Southern 
States, where corn bread is never out of place, even 
at the best furnished tables. 



The rich breads and puddings with which we shall 
first lead corn meal into general favor, are not com- 
mended on the score of cheapness, except in country 
places where eggs and butter have but little market 
value; but that it is a real liking for corn meal, pure 
and simple, and not for the condiments, which ob- 
tains among so large a proportion of the Southerners, 
is seen from the fact that the prevailing dinner 
bread at the most expensively provided steamboat 
and hotel tables was formerly, and probably is yet, 
the corn cake made of nothing whatever but meal 
and water. 

Why one section should prefer a corn diet more 
than another when there is no consideratiion of econ- 
omy involved at all, I have never seen fully accounted 
for, and will venture the supposition that it shows 
the result of tastes trained in early life by a race of 
domestic cooks who knew how to make corn bread 
good. What has been done can be done again. 

It will not be expected that we professed cooks 
shall dabble either in political economy or social sci- 
ence, but I, for one, cannot help thinking that a bet- 
ter knowledge of the ways to make corn meal a pal- 
atable diet, difiused throughout the land, would re 
suit in bringing the fiifteen-cents-per-bushel corn of 
Kansas and Nebraska into its proper use — of fur- 
nishing cheap and wholesome food and luxuries for 
the million. 

In the culinary departments of the best American 
hotels, it is but reasonable to expect that the greatest 
perfection in compounding American specialties will 
have been attained. However there is only one not- 
able instance of a large hotel becoming celebrated 
for its corn bread, even that is nearly forgotten, now 
that there is no more call for special commissions to 
go and teach the art to Europe. 

I have seen "going the rounds," what purported 
to be a receipt for St. Charles corn bread, which 
mentioned sugar as one of the ingredients, but can- 
not consider it genuine. Difierent cooks may have 
had diflFerent ways, but the following was the form- 
ula in use on the floating palaces of the same day, 
such steamboats as the Southern Belle and the Mag- 
nolia, of the "coast" trade, and the long-trip boats 
which made the excellence of this bread known on 
the upper rivers. We used to bake it in cake moulds, 
and sometimes serve it with sauce as corn pound 
pudding; more in fun than from any necessities of 
the case. It can be sliced thin like cake, and used 
in many ways : 



OSS. St. Charles Corn Bread. 



1 pound of white corn meal (not quite a quart). 
4 ounces of fresh butter, melted (size of two eggs). 
1 pint of boiling water. 
1 pint of cold milk. 
4 eggs. 1 level teaspoonful salt. 
1 teaspoonful of wholesome, home-made baking 
powder. 



16« 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



Pour the boiling water into the meal, wetting and 
scalding it all. Then add the melted butter, salt and 
milk, and then the eggs. Put the baking pan in the 
oven to get hot, without greasing it. Add the pow- 
der to the batter ; beat up with the large wire egg- 
whisk, then pour it into the pan. The batter is as 
thin as for batter cakes. IF the pan is hissing hot 
it never sticks, and there is no discoloration of burnt 
grease. This bread should be about an inch and a 
half deep in the pan, and bake half an hour or more. 
The sooner the top crust is formed the better, after 
that it needs to bake slowly. 

This, when done, is, of course, only corn bread, 
but it has the peculiar characteristic, that everybody 
likes it. But pastry cooks, generally, "hate to make 
it." It is a little hard to bake just right. For an- 
other sort, not too rich nor good for human nature's 
daily food, we have the regular stand-by — the com- 
mon hotel corn bread, which may be good or other- 
wise, according to the skill of the maker. 



OS3. Oolmnon Com Bread. 



1 pound of white corn meal. 
3 ounces of melted lard (2 large basting-spoon- 
fuls). 

1 pint of boiling water. 

1 pint of cold water or milk. 

2 eggs. 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 small teaspoonful of home-made baking powder. 

Scald about two-thirds of the meal with the boiling 
water, leaving the rest at the side of the pan to be 
stirred in with the other ingredients. Beat the 
powder in last, and bake as directed for the other 
kind. 

Now if corn meal was always alike there would be 
no more to be said. But here is where the genius 
for making corn bread comes in. Both of these sorts 
should have a smooth crust rounded over like a good 
pound cake. The particular point is the scalding of 
the meal, and that varies according as the meal 
is fine or coarse ground. I have known some few 
neophytes who saw into the deepest depths of this 
profound matter at the first glance, but others, seem- 
ingly as intelligent, would slip up every time a dif- 
ferent grade of meal came in hand. Sometimes the 
crust would rise and crack open forty ways, like a 
map of the Rocky Mountains, and the bread would 
fall to pieces. That was because the meal was coarse 
and not sufficiently scalded, or not mixed thin 
enough Sometimes the bread would rise at first, 
but then cave in, all but the edges, like a pond gone 
dry, and cut like mush. That was because the meal 
was fine ground, and would not bear scalding much. 
White meal coarsely ground is the best. Some few 
peopk think they like yellow meal, but as surely as 
it IS put to the test in hotel cookery the demand both 
for bread and mush falls otF, and both are soon en- 
tirely neglected And yellow meal, for some reason, 



soon acquires a bitter, musty taste, which may have 
as much to do with the small liking there is for cora 
meal preparations as any other reason. 



634. 



Corn Gems. 



Corn gems were instituted to meet the grave emer- 
gency that arises when more than four persons in 
one house want a corner piece of corn bread. Their 
other use is for corn bread in individual style. 

There is no need of special receipts, as both of the 
corn bread mixtures already given are first rate,, 
baked in gem pans. The richest, for individual 
loaves, should be baked in deep round pans. The 
people who call for corner pieces like the other, baked 
thin, to be nearly all crust. The gems should be 
fresh baked, every half-hour, served hot and not 
sweated in the pans.

Com Meal Muffins. 



The very best are made with yeast, but these arc 
very good and can be made on shortest notice. 
"Whoe'er rejects them must be hard to please. 

And ripe for treasons, stratagems and spoils." 
1 pound of white cornmeal (not quite a quart). 
4 ounces of fresh butter, lard, or both mixed. 

1 pint of boiling water. 

1^ pints of cold milk (3 cups). 
Half pound of flour. Salt. 
Yolks, only, of 4 eggs. 

2 small teaspoonfuls of baking powdej. 

Put the shortening in a saucepan with the water, 
boil, and scald the meal with them. Add the salt, 
then the milk and flour alternately, then the yolks, 
and lastly the powder beaten in well with the wire 
egg-whisk. 

Bake in greased muffin rings, 10 or 15 minutes, in 
a hot oven. Serve hot. 

The batter must be thin to make good muffins. 
Make the pan hot on which the rings ar« placed, be- 
fore filling, to prevent running under ; otherwise use 
rings with bottoms. 

In daily practice we learn short ways to work, 
with fewest vessels. When the object is to thoroughly 
scald the meal, it is not best to put the unmelted 
shortening with it first, but the way indicated above 
is good for all kinds of corn breads. The milk is 
necessary to give good color in baking.

Tortillas. 



Now that direct trade between Chicago and Old 
Mexico is about to be opened, it might be as well to 
pay a little attention to Mexican preferences, too 

How romantic are all the words that come straying 
among us from that land of the sun ! And how all 
the Mexican story-writers, from Captain Mayne 
Reid down, have revelled and gloried in the power

these sonorous terms gave them over the imagination 
of their bewildered Northern readers ! Tarantula, 
arroya, caballero, ranchero, hacienda, cuisiniero, tor 
tilla ! It was always the tortilla that crowned the 
closing day. The tempting tortilla ; the sweet, the 
delicious tortilla. 

But the story-writer has yet to be born with self- 
denial enough to drop his romance and tell his won- 
dering readers what the tortilla is. 

Once I became acquainted with a Mexican youth, 
who was a native of the ancient city of the Montezu- 
mas. There was poetry in his name. It was Man- 
uel de Carvalho. There was poetry in his face, for 
he had melancholy eyes and a sentimental mous- 
tache. His ancestors were Dons, but he, alas, was 
but valet to an English tourist. He had been through 
all the gay capitals of the Old World, yet nothing 
had ever prevailed to chase the cynical expression 
from his lips, or withdraw his thoughts from the 
home of his early days. 

And then he came to a noted pleasure resort that 
was frequented by wealthy Southern people. And 
on going into the bakery one day, he saw a griddle 
full of something that caused him to stop, open- 
mouthed, with delighted surprise ; and as soon as he 
was sure he could believe his eyes he struck an atti- 
tude, clasped his hands and shouted in ecstacy : 
"Ha, ha! — Tor — theel — as!" So at last Manuel 
was happy. And this is how the tortillas were 
made: 



Mexican Tortillas. 



Mix a quart of white corn meal with boiling water 
enough to barely wet it, and cold water after that to 
make it like thin mush. Add a teaspoonful of salt. 
Drop large spoonfuls on the hot griddle, and spread 
them out to form thin cakes. 

"But," you say, "your toritUas are nothing but 
the Southern hoe cakes." Yes, that's what they are. 
But many people like hoe cakes better if they are 
shortened a little. 



OST, 



Hoe Cakes, or Com Bannocks. 



2 pounds of white corn meal. 

Half pound of lard. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Put the lard in the middle of the meal with the 
salt, and pour in a little boiling water to melt it. 
Then add cold water or milk to make like thin mush. 
Bake on a griddle or "hoe," placing the dough with 
a spoon and flattening out thin. 



"Why cannot we have this?" 
"You can have it." 

"What 13 it folded so nicely in a napkin? 
liki. brown bread." 
"It is brown bread." 



"And you have brown bread plenty on hand all 
the time?" 

"0, but this is not bakers' Boston brown ; tHs is 
delicious." 

That was said before the Chicago fire. 0, incom- 
prehensible hotel boarders who live always on the fat 
of the land and tire of it ! But in a well-regulated 
hotel you can have anything. This is one of the va 
rieties of bread made principally of corn meal which 
the Boston writer before quoted, had in mind : 

"On account of its lack of gluten, Indian meal is 
not well adapted for making bread without a slight 
admixture of wheat or rye flour." 

That is the eastern idea, not the southern or west- 
ern. 

This kind of bread is very It con- 

tains no shortening, except what may be conveyed 
by rich buttermilk, when that can be had instead of 
baking powder, and is probably very healthful eaten 
cold. Reckless inhabitants of the hotel world, gen- 
erally prefer to eat it right away quick while it is 
hot. And still very few deaths occur.

steamed, or "Home-Made" Brown 
Bread. 



2 pounds of corn meal. 

1 quart of boiling water. 

Half pint of re-boiled, black molasses (coflfee cup 
full). 

1^ pints of cold milk. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

4 heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

1 pound of graham flour. 

1 pound of white flour. 

Pour the water boiling into the meal and stir; then 
mix in the molasses and the other ingredients in the 
order as written — the powder in the flour — and stir 
up thoroughly. It makes a stiff batter, too soft to be 
handled. Put it in two pails with tight-fitting lids 
and steam from 4 to 6 hours, then bake a short time 
to form a crust. The pails should be made for the 
purpose, of best stovepipe iron, a trifle wider at top 
than at bottom. Brush a little lard over the insides 
and then wipe it off thoroughly before putting in the 
dough, and there will be no stains on the crust when 
done. Where there is a steam chest to the range, over 
which vegetables are steamed, the pails can be set in- 
side in the water, and then there is nothing in the 
bread line more easily made than this. Makes 8 
pounds of bread ; cuts into about 4 dozen slices. 
Enough for the average orders of 75 people for one 
meal, there being other kinds of bread. But if you 
have had it talked about all through the house 40 
people will get away with this much easily. Such is 
the effect of ad vertising. Should th e bread cut sticky, 
use a little less liquid in mixing next time.

dings of Indian meal, of dilBFerent degrees, and this 
following will, probably, by good judges, be consid- 
ered the best. 

"Tell that cook," said a healthy St. Louis captain, 
his boat then laid up in the ice, "to make this once 
more and let me know when, and then he may go to 
heaven." 

Most of us have heard something like that in a 
sarcastic mood, but this was a jolly bon vivant, and 
was being helped the second time, so before "that 
cook" started to heaven, I prevailed upon him to 
abstract and perfect out of the chaos of his guess- 
work the following receipt. 



6:39. Mohawk Pudding. 



2 quarts of milk. 
10 ounces of corn meal. 

4 ounces of fresh butter. 

6 ounces of rebelled black molasses. 

5 whole eggs. 

6 yolks. 

1 large lemon. 

Pinch of salt. 

Make mush in the usual way by bringing the milk 
to a boil, sprinkling in the meal and beating at the 
same time with egg whisk to prevent lumps. Stir 
over a fire a few minutes ; then put on a tight lid to 
keep the steam in ; push the saucepan to the back of 
the range and let the mush remain at cooking heat 
without burning, for two hours or more. Then turn 
it out into a pan and mix in the other ingredients — 
the eggs beaten light — the rind of the lemon grated 
and the juice squeezed in. Bake about half an 
hour, or till the egg in it is fairly set, and no longer. 

This makes about 3 quarts of pudding ; enough 
for the average orders of 50 persons. It can be 
baked in fluted pudding moulds, and turned out 
whole if handled carefully, where so required, or else 
in two small pans well buttered. 

A mild, neutral sauce is best with this. If hot 
sweetened cream cannot be had try the following, 
which is as ornamental as useful, 

630. 

Sauce Doree, Golden Sauce, or Butter 

Sauce. 



1 pound of white sugar. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 

1 quart of water. 

4 ounces of best fresh butter. 

2 or 3 yolks of eggs. 
Nutmeg extract to flavor. 

Boil the water in a bright saucepan. Mix the 
starch in the sugar dry, and rapidly stir them in. 
When it has boiled up, beat in the butter. Pour a 
little sauce to the yolks in a cup ; beat, then mix all 
together. Just before it begins to boil remove it from 
the fire, taking care the yolks do not curdle with too 
much cooking. 



031. Ohickasa-w Pudding. 



Brown Indian Souflle. 



Perhaps not the connoisseur's pudding, but 
thought by many to have less style and more real 
comfort in it than any other. It is something of a 
curiosity for its puffy lightness, and should be served 
whole in that condition as soon as done, or else dish 
it up, if you wish to secure for the bubble reputation, 
out of the oven's mouth. 

You will never know it at its best, unless you can 
procure the old-fashioned, thick, black molasses. 

3 pints of water. 
12 ounces of corn meal. 

1 pound of re-boiled black molasses. 

8 ounces of butter. 

8 eggs. 

No salt needed but what is in the butter, and take 
care that it has not too much. 

Make mush by sprinkling the dry meal into the 
boiling water, and beating at the same time with the 
egg whisk. When it has boiled a minute or two put 
in the butter and molasses, stir together, put on the 
lid and push the saucepan to the back of the range 
to simmer about an hour. It is not very apt to burn. 
Then turn the mixture into a pan, beat the 8 eggs a 
little and gradually stir them in. 

Bake in a slow oven about 45 minutes. Makes 
about 2^ quarts. 

Eat hot with cream, or, failing that, make this 
sauce, which will relieve its want of color. 



63;3« Lemon Butter Sauce. 



Sauce Oitronne. 



1 pound of sugar. 

2 ounces of corn starch. 

1 quart of water. 

2 ounces of fresh butter. 

2 lemons' rind grated and juice of one. 

6 yolks of eggs. 

Mix the sugar, grated rind and starch together dry; 
stir them into the boiling water ; add the lemon juice 
and butter, and when it boils again pour in the beat- 
en yolks quickly and beat well. As soon as the eggs 
begin to thicken take the sauce from the lire and 
strain immediately. 

633. Thanksgiving Pudding. 



Indian Plum Pudding, Steamed. 



3 quarts of milk. 
1^ pounds of corn meal. 
8 ounces of butter, or minced suet. 
12 ounces of re-boiled^ black molasses. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY OOOK. 



159 



10 whole 
10 yolks. 

2 lemons. 

1 pound of seedless raisins. 

1 pound of good, clean currants. 

Pinch of salt. 

Make mush with the meal and milk and let it cook 
at back of the range, with tight lid on, for 2 hours or 
more. Then add the other ingredients in order as 
written — the rinds of the lemons grated and juice 
squeezed in, and eggs all beaten light together. 
Dust the fruit with a small cup of flour. Steam in 
pudding moulds an hour and a half or longer, ac- 
cording to size. This makes 4^ quarts. 

Butter the moulds and shake flour inside before 
filling. Serve with any sauce suitable for English 
plum pudding. 



635. Thanksgiving Pudding. 



Indian Plum Pudding Baked. 



The same as the preceding, except that chopped 
apples can be used instead of currants, or in addi- 
tion to them, which would make the steamed pud- 
ding too soft. Spices can be added at option. May 
be baked in deep ornamental moulds, well buttered 
and dusted with flour, and served with burning 
brandy sauce. Will bake in half the time required 
for steaming. 



634. 

Fatty Bread and Butteimilk. 



• This entree never appeared on any bill-of-fare. It 
is hoped that nobody will make it, it might be 
thought too rich for good health. It is put in here 
merely in an historical sort of way, because it is 
strictly American and is not on record in any of the 
French books. To be still more precise, it is an in- 
stitution of Blackville, and the people who believed 
in it had broad shiny faces and did not know a 
thing about dyspepsia. Although again it is hoped 
nobody will ever make anything so greasy anymore, 
it has to be recorded that the boys who did not be- 
long in Blackville had a wonderful knack of coming 
home from squirrel shooting at sundown, just at the 
most favorable time for snatching a portion of this 
peculiar feast, to which the Blackville people did not 
welcome them, and always declared it tasted better 
than butternuts. There are many Blackvilles in the 
United States, and the one where this dish came 
nearest being named in French was on Bayou Black, 
not very far from New Orleans, but you could not 
translate the French spoken there, and, moreover, 
•alabashes full of sugar cane juice from the mills 



took the place of buttermilk, and it was not quite the 
same thing. But there was a Blackville near that 
large hotel at White Sulphur Springs, and Black- 
ville near Brownsville, on Blackwater river, at the 
Sweet Springs in Missouri. 

It was only in the flush times of hog killing that 
Blackville could indulge in this luxury ; but if com- 
pany was expected from the opposition village, what- 
ever its name was, perhaps the young Blaokvillans 
with their 'possum dogs would pass a whole night in 
the woods and fell any number of trees till they had 
'possums enough. Because you can't make fatty 
bread without fat, and 'possum's fat does very well. 

Somebody has to churn in the morning and take 
the buttermilk down to the spring house to become 
cool. The rest of it is very simple : 

1 pound of corn meal. 

^ pound of lard or 'possum fat. 

Salt. 

Pour the lard, melted, into the meal, and stir in 
enough cold water to make it like thin mush. 

Spread in thin cakes on the hot stove lid, and 
when fried on one side turn them over. If you 
have no stove, but only a fireplace that takes in half 
a hickory tree trunk at a time, rake out some coals 
and bake the cakes in a spider. 

To be eaten hot, with cold buttermilk. 



In extreme contrast to the foregoing is the White- 
ville variety of breai. 



636. 



Corn Dodgers. 



The ordinary dinner bread of the South. 

Take the required quantity of corn meal, say a 
quart, and stir it up with cold water enough to make 
it like thick mush, just so that it can be shaped. 
Make it with hand or spoon, in shapes like goose 
eggs, and place them almost touching in a baking 
pan that is kept hot on top of the range while they 
are being placed. Bake in a hot oven. 

It is usually insisted upon that no salt shall be put 
into this kind. Serve hot. 

Simple as this is, some persons can make it twice 
as palatable as others. One requirement is to make 
the meal take up all the water it will carry without 
losing shape. Another is to bake it in a very hot 
oven, so that it will become brown without being too 
dry and hard. 

While everybody will agree that there must be a 
perfection point for every common article, beyond 
which it cannot be improved, it is hardly likely 
that anyone will take the trouble to scald the meal 
for batter cakes. There is not time for all these 
little things in hotel business, and yet it has to be 
set down that therein lies the point that beats com- 
mon work The following will do without :

THE AMERICAN PASTB7 COOK. 



63T. Com Batter Cakes. 



1 pound of white corn meal. 
J pound of flour. 

3 ounces of melted lard (J cup). 

2 eggs. A little salt. 

1 quart of milk or water. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Mix gradually to avoid having lumps in the bat- 
ter, add the lard, melted, and the powder last. If 
no milk, a spoonful of syrup is required to give col- 
or. But sometimes you have to work for thorough 
philomaizians who love corn for itself alone and do 
not want any flour in theirs. In that case you must 
pcald the meal. 



038. 

Corn Batter Cakes "Without Flour. 



IJ pounds of corn meal. 

1 quart of water or milk. 

4 ounces of lard. 

4 eggs. Salt. 

1 teaspoonful of baking powder. 

Scald the meal with half the water, and mix up 
the same as if for corn bread. 

In all the preceding receipts where baking pow- 
der is directed to be used, it is to be understood that 
buttermilk and soda will do as well, if the butter- 
milk be genuine, not watered, and sour enough to 
counteract a small teaspoonful of soda to the pint. 



G30, Theory and Practice. 

Since it has become the very general custom to eat 
one or other of the several varieties of mush as a first 
course at breakfast and supper, the best methods of 
preparing the simple dish so as to have it in perfec- 
tion can no longer be considered a matter too trifling 
for any first-rate cook's attention. Besides, what- 
ever of consequence mush may lack in the instance, 
it gains through diff'usion, for thousands of cooks are 
wanted to make good mush for every one that is re- 
quired to prepare costly and ornamental dinners; so, 
you see, from the utility point of view, well-cooked 
mush is a thousand times better than well cooked 
truflHes. And if that reads like a riddle it will have 
to go, for there is no room here to straighten it out. 

When a lot of corn meal is piled into a saucepan 
of water, not half enough for so much meal, and im- 
patiently stirred up and served ten minutes afterward, 
that is not mush. I don't know what it is. There is 
no name for it. But yet there are people so possessed 
with the idea that mush can never be cooked enough, 
that they become crotchety, one might almost say 
fanatical, in pursuing the other extreme. 

As we may have to go to the Germans for instruc- 
tion in German dishes, to the French when the mat- 
ter is French, and to the English when the excellence 
is reputedly theirs, perhaps no excuse is needed for 
going often to the Southern States, even to plantation 
Ufe for instances, whilst American corn meal has the 



front place. Down in that land of large estates and 
extensive operations, there used to be places where 
from year's end to year's end the mush cauldron 
never stopped boiling, except as it was emptied and 
replenished once in every twenty-four hours, that 
being the time considered necessary for the meal to 
cook before it could become wholesome food for the 
scores of laborers whose principal food it was. These 
kettles, some with mush and some with hominy, 
hung in huge fireplaces, and were tended by old 
crones,with stirring paddles like boat oars, day and 
night, like the witches in Macbeth with their "bub- 
ble, bubble, toil and trouble ; fire burn and cauldron 
bubble." How should we like to make mush for the 
folks that way ? There are a good many degrees be- 
tween ten-minute mush and twenty-four hour mush, 
and as to the stirring there are very few hotels where 
even ten minutes can be bestowed upon that part 
as a regular thing. Fortunately there is little need 
of it. Heat and steam are restless enough to keep up 
a very fair bubble of themselves without much manual 
labor. It seems to be with corn meal as with rice, 
it will take up a certain amount of water and no 
more. Ten ounces of rice will absorb a quart of wa- 
ter and all the water that is added beyond that only 
tends to separate the particles and make a blue 
gruel. Five ounces of corn meal will do the same as 
the ten ounces of rice, absorb a quart of water and 
no more. With a much less proportion of water the 
meal can never be well cooked, because the finer 
particles take up the water first and the course 
grains always must remain raw and hard, no matter 
how long on the fire. Rice will cook well done in 
three-quarters of an hour; corn meal requires about 
three hours to reach the same point, although it may 
be passibly good after only one or two hours boil- 
ing. 

To reduce the time of cooking some people steep 
the meal in water several hours before. There is 
nothing to be said against this except that it is likelier 
to be forgot or neglected than remembered and be- 
comes a cause of irregularity under the usual hotel 
conditions. 



640. 



Com Meal Mush. 



2 quarts of water. 
10 ounces of white corn meal. 

1 rounded tablespoonful of salt. 

Use a flat-bottomed, bright iron saucepan. Brush 
the inside with the least possible amount of melted 
lard. This reduces the tendency to burn and les- 
sens the waste. Put the salt in the water, boil, and 
sprinkle the dry meal in with one hand while you 
beat with the large wire egg-whisk in the other, till 
all is in and there are no lumps to be seen. Put on 
the lid, push the saucepan to the back of the range 
and let it simmer with the steam shut im for ihree 
hours. 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK.

Then turn it out and keep it hot in a bright sink 
in the steam chest. 

Where the mush has to be made on a cook-stove, 
a cast pot with feet, to raise the bottom an inch from 
the fire, is best. 

You will have the same measure of made mush as 
you had water at first ; four quarts of water and 
twenty ounces of meal producing one gallon. 

Double the quantity required for one meal should 
be made and half put away to become cold to fry. 
For this purpose very slightly grease a bright tin 
pan, press the mush evenly into it, and slightly 
brush over with a brush dipped in melted lard again. 
No matter how little the grease, it prevents the for- 
mation of a crust by drying on top. Warm the pan 
a few seconds and the mush, when cold, will turn 
out without trouble. 

Each quart of cold mush will cut into about ten 
blocks or slices for frying. 

641. 



Fried mush is one of the things, as fried potatoes 
is another, that has a telling effect in giving the im- 
pression of excellence or otherwise of the hotel table. 
That indefinite something so often mentioned, called 
excellence of cmsme, is made up of hundreds of such 
trifles as properly fried mush. 

Recefntly a correspondent of a leading New York 
newspaper, and whose letter in part was reprinted 
in the Reporter, had occasion to comment upon a 
breakfast at one of the famous hotels of Boston, and 
went into well trained ecstacies over the simple per- 
fection of it all. "0, the ineffable cuisine T' was the 
exclamation, and of course it was a woman writing, 
for men never think of original expressions ; one 
says "the cooking was tip top," and all the succeed- 
ing thousands say the same words. Well, there was 
no mention of fried mush, but there was a hint of 
golden-hued cutlets — breaded cutlets — and the same 
conditions and effects pertain to both articles. 

There was an intimation of crisp salad, and deli- 
cately browned rolls and perfect, fresh butter. When, 
in any case, you are curious to know "upon what 
meat doth this our Caesar feed ?' ' you may be sure 
that it is nothing more than you yourself can buy in 
the market, and at the best of breakfasts the cups 
are not so liable to be "filled with the nectar that 
Jupiter sips," as with good coffee and chocolate. The 
guests prefer them. 

This tempting-looking fried mush — and breaded 
cutlets, too — cannot be had, as a rule to be depend- 
ed on, unless lard, good fresh lard, can be afforded 
for the frying. One thing essential to the houses of 
ineffable cuisine, is to be always excellent, and not 
good for one observer and indifferent for the next. 
But cheap, home-saved material, if good sometimes, 
always carries a proviso. Meat drippings and soup 
stock toppings a^*^ wood in a comparative sense, but 



are apt to make the fries dark colored. Also, thes© 
articles cannot be had perfect unless cracker meal 
can be afforded to bread them with. Stale bread 
dried and crushed and sifted is next best ; corn 
meal for breading is the worst of all. But powdered 
bread produces a reddish brown, and when dripping 
for frying is used with it, the mush often looks more 
like smoked meat. I do not wish to be understood 
as advocating expensive ways. All the cheap ways 
are to be given in these columns ; ways of cooking 
without eggs, without cream, or milk, or butter, 
without baking powder ; and it will not have to be 
said the articles so made are as good as the best, only 
that they are good enough ; but the opportunity is 
here improved of showing by one instance out of 
hundreds, how some tables are and must be better 
than the rest, and why people cannot have four dollar 
fare for three dollars, nor three dollar fare for two. 
When breaded articles like fried mush are made so 
good with crushed bread crumbs and meat fat from 
the roasting pans that nobody observes any inferi- 
ority, the credit is wholly due to the skill and care- 
fulness of the cook. Corn meal for breading has such 
a bad appearance that it ought to be counted out. 
People who like the taste of fried meal, and will have 
even oysters breaded with it, have to forego the 
neatness and color that the other methods give. 

One of our French preceptors gives us a homily 
on frying, put in the readable form of a Count So- 
and-so lecturing his cook, who, on the occasion of a 
dinner to invited guests, had spoiled a choice fish 
through putting it into lard (or oil) not hot enough. The 
gist of it is, that if you put the breaded article into 
lard not hot enough to immediately cook the outside, 
the breading washes off, the juices of the fish or meat 
ooze out, and these cannot be browned at all without 
being entirely dried out. With an article so largely 
made up of water as mush, it is still more necessary 
to have the outside coat of egg and crumbs instantly 
set, otherwise it will merely melt away and be lost. 

64S. Fried Mush, Breaded. 



Take the pan of cold boiled mush, prepared as al- 
ready described, and having slightly warmed the 
bottom, turn it upside down on a clean paste-board, 
kept for the purpose. Cut the mush into blocks, 
square or diamond-shaped, or else into slices or fan- 
cy forms, according to the use intended. 

For every quart of mush one egg is required, to be 
beaten up with an equal amount of water. 

Roll the pieces in this, and then in the meal made 
by pounding and sifting crackers. 

Have a saucepan half full of lard made hot 
enough to hiss loudly when a drop of water touches 
it, but yet not smoking. Drop in the mush a few 
pieces at a time ; fry them yellow-brown — about 
ten minutes — then place them in a colander set 
in a pan, and in a hot place, to drain and dry before 
serving.

THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



Wonder by what mischance in the distribution of 
names, it happened that we drew mush from Ger- 
man mus, when the other corn-raising peoples nearly 
all drew Latin polenta ? 

For it is not to be supposed that we have the monop 
olyof mush, excepting the poor word itself. That, in- 
deed, does not seem to be known even to the English 
as a household word, for our mush, if they take it 
as an experiment, they call maize porridge, our oat- 
meal mush is the Scotch oatmeal porridge, our 
cracked-wheat mush is the English frumenty, and 
mush they will not say at all. 

France, which raises annually thirty million bush- 
els of corn, makes mush and mush puddings, but 
calls mush polenta. 

The term is specially applied to pudding made of 
the meal of chestnuts, the same that, possibly, Count 
Nesselrode was fond of, for, improved to a superlative 
degree, we now find a pudding of chestnuts called 
Nesselrode pudding ; but the Italian polenta, a corn 
meal pudding, is also made in France, and polenta 
for mush has a general application. Portugal raises 
fifteen million bushels of corn, and makes corn food, 
and there it is not prosaic mush but musical polenta. 
Italy exceeds them all, raises forty-five million bush- 
els, makes mush, and calls it polenta. Also, Brillat-Sa- 
varin, enumerating the various articles contributed 
by diflFerent countries to make a perfect cuisine, says 
that Italy sends polenta liqueuers, and in the want of 
better knowledge, the supposition is unavoidable that 
he meant Italian corn whisky or its compounds. 
Even our neighbor, Brazil, raising and using large 
amounts of corn does not call mush our tasteless 
way, but speaking Portugese no doubt sups on mel- 
lifluous polenta. 

Now mush does well enough for every day use, 
but we want something for Sunday and company 
times, and mush, look at it any way you please, is 
positively too homely and humble to be elevated to 
any conspicuous position. The article mush is wanted 
to go to table with some very nice entrees ; it is 
pleasant to the sight and good for food, and can be 
cut handsomely and browned prettily and set up or- 
namentally, and is good for car apes and fleurons, and 
croustades; but the word mush will never fit in 
gracefully where mush ought to be; it will not har- 
monize with the grand surroundings of notable open- 
ing days and splendid banquets at gilt-edged hotels; 
it will hardly be admitted to the finest bills of fare, 
to be printed in gold on satin, with borders of Jap- 
anese mocking-birds and garlands of roses from 
Bendemere's Stream, now will it? But you cannot 
say the same of polenta, the diflference is immense. 

Polenta is Italian, and used to mocking-birds and 
roses and all that. Mush is Cinderella, but polenta 
is Cinderella changed to the princess. If this differ- 
ence is not already apparent, let us put it to the test. 
You cannot imagine mush being introduced with pro- 



priety into any line of tragic or heroic verse, but 
polenta can be, and can hold its own. Take this ex- 
ample : 

**0, Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?" 
— instead of a member of some other family — and it 
will be seen that without the least loss of dignity our 
impassioned Juliet might shout : 

"0 Polenta, Polenta! wherefore art thou Po- 
lenta ?' ' — instead of bread-crumbed trout. With due 
care taken to give the true lisp to the **t" in polenta, 
as it would be heard in some old moss-grown inn in 
Granada, under the shadow of the Alhambra or any 
other Castle in Spain, the paraphrase possesses a 
depth of plaintive passion that would set the mock 
heroics which do so murder the original at defiance. 
And yet polenta is mush, but note the diflference : 

"0 Mush, Mush! wherefore art thou Mush?" — 
instead of Polenta. 

No use ; even capitals do not help it — will not 
ring in right at all, but you immediately think of 
Bottom, the weaver, and Starveling, his mate, and 
"0 Bottom, Bottom 1 thou art translated 1" 

This is an idle fancy, but it is serious, too, for we 
want to put mush, at least fried mush, on the finest 
bills of fare that are gotten up — bills for the Capu- 
lets and Montagus, stately as Romeo, dainty as Ju- 
liet, if not so tragical. Some of the finest bills of 
fare extant have, for a dainty dish, "Marrow on 
Toast." Mush might well take the toast's place, 
yet, it is hard to say why, "Marrow on Mush" 
does not seem so stylish. "Border of Mush, Filled" 
with something, would not cut as grand a figure 
among the entrees as '^Bordeur de Polenta Oarnies" 
now would it ? 

Speaking of Juliet, isn't it Juliet who says: 
"That, which we call a rose, 
By any other name would smell as sweet?" 

Literally taken, millions have agreed to that, 
but there is something behind the literal ; words are 
beguiling. 

"Who is't," quoth he, "that there reposes, 
Upon yon bank of summer roses?" 

Here the idea conveyed by reposes on roses is so 
pleasant that you forget about the probable thorns 
and go on reading to see what other pleasant things 
there are, and it is the same with eating as with 
reposing. Let a person spend a season at some de- 
lightful winter resort and write home about the "ex- 
quisite mush," and all the people written to would 
surely laugh. But let it be the other case, and let 
the expression be "0, the divine polenta," and tlxey 
would no more laugh than they would at the di- 
vine Piccolomini or the divine Celestina, but would 
go on reading to see what other good things you 
were having, and would forget about the probable 
cheapness of polenta, which would be the thorn in 
this case. Thus, it is seen, mush has a very bad case, 
and it is hard to see what is to be done about it. 
Perhaps somebody will help out this philological 
diflftculty, and we will go right along with our re- 
ceipts.

Polenta Prite. 



Fried mush can be used to good advantage in many 
dishes that usually have toast, or fried bread or fried 
potato garnishes, but in the guileless form of the com- 
mon breakfast fried mush, it is open to the same ob- 
jection that Brillat-Savarin brings against the po- 
tato; he says: "I never take any. I think nothing 
of the potato unless as a stop-gap in times of great 
Bcarcity. It is, to my taste, most insipid." There- 
fore resort should be had to the gastronome's ex- 
pedient in many similar cases; slice the mush thin, 
cut the shapes small, and mix minced cheese with 
the cracker meal to bread it with. The proportion 
of cheese is about one cupful, finely minced, to three 
cupfuls of cracker meal, but it must depend upon the 
quality of the cheese. Needs extra care in frying, 
as it soon acquires a deep color. 



044. Polenta, a 1' Italienne. 



A cake of buttered mush, with cheese baked on 
the top. 

1 quart of water. 

6 ounces of yellow corn meal. 

2 ounces of butter. 

4 ounces of cheese, minced. 

Level teaspoonful of salt and pepper mixed. 

Half cupful of cracker meal. 

Brush the inside of a small saucepan slightly with 
melted butter, and make mush with the water and 
meal in the usual way, letting it cook with a lid on, 
in its own steam, on the furthest corner of the range, 
about 2 hours. Then stir in half the butter and the 
pepper and salt. It should be a stiff, well-cooked 
mush. Spread the other ounce of butter on the 
baking pan bottom — a 2 qt., bright, shallow 
milk-pan is best — sift half the cracker meal 
on that, then place the mush by spoonfuls so as to 
smooth it over at last without disturbing the under 
crust. When leveled over, strew on the minced 
cheese, sift rest of cracker meal on top, and bake in 
a brisk oven half an hour, or till nicely browned at 
top and bottom. This is a good dish for lunch. May 
be served like macaroni and cheese, or macaroni 
cake. Is best baked en caisse, that is, in little paper 



When the cheese furnished is too dry to melt in 
the oven, moisten the top with the back of a spoon 
dipped in melted butter. When too rich and melt- 
ing, use less, and more cracker meal. 



045. 



To Fry Mush 'Without Eggs. 



Mix flour and water together to make thickening 
of the consistency of cream, without lumps. Roll 
the pieces of mush in it instead of egg and water, 
then in cracker meal, or bread crumbs, and fry in 
the usual way. A half cup of water or milk to two 



heaping tablespoonfuls of flour makes it. Milk gives 
the better color. The frying grease has to be hotter 
and fewer pieces must be put in at once to make thil 
way nearly as good as the other. It answers very 
well, also, to roll the mush in rich milk without 
flour. 



046. 



Mush Sautes. 



Sautes is sauteed, in meaning, according to Eng- 
lish terminations, and that means fried in a common 
frying-pan like fried eggs, etc. The French or prop- 
er frying requires a quantity of hot fat or oil, as in- 
dicated in the preceding directions for fried mush. 

The word Sautes is perpetually appearing in hotel 
bills of fare, but the people to whom it conveys any 
meaning are extremely few. It seems to be usually 
guessed to mean sauce. As it is a technical term, a 
person might read French a long time without meet- 
ing with it elsewhere than at table. There is suffi- 
cient reason for its use, seeing that no other word ex- 
presses the same thing correctly. 

To saute mush, cut it in slices not over half an 
inch thick, and flour them all over. Place a spoon- 
ful of lard, clarified butter or clarified meat fat, in 
the frying pan, and when hot put in two or three 
slices, not near enough to touch. Brown it quickly, 
and turn over with an egg slice. Is only good when 
fried as wanted and served immediately. 



There is still another variety of mush, and wheth- 
er we make use of the knowledge or not, the neces- 
sity of at least being posted on them all was well ex- 
emplified in the luck of a certain man from Boston. 
He came from one of the best hotels of that city, and 
obtained a good position in St. Louis. What he 
claimed to have been, or what he had been in the 
famous Boston house, is neither here nor there, but 
it was evident that his had been only one particular 
line of duty, for, unexcelled in some things, there 
were other smaller matters that baffled his efforts, 
and one of these was fried mush. He knew of but 
one kind, and that was fried mush balls, which, you 
see, was a great misfortune, considering that he was 
head cook of a large hotel, having assistants who did 
not think it best to do otherwise than as he directed. 
So mush balls they made and made them good, very 
likely, or else the demand was small and the style 
unnoticed, for that way lasted quite a while. But 
presently evil days came, and brought with them 
some people of grand import, who had been board- 
ing at the Hotel Terrible, up the avenue. 

They came in a huff, and soon began to sniff, and 
looking about for inferiorities, observed the fried 
mush balls. Then they pulled them apart, analyzed 
them, condemned them. If there was anything they 
did love, it was good fried mush ; but these mush 
balls were simply atrocious. They demanded what 
they were pleased to term the genuine article. But 
they might as well have called spirits from the vasty

deep, that would not come when they did call them, 
for neither they themselves nor anybody else could 
tell what diflference of process was required. So dis- 
satisfaction grew up on both sides. It took an earth- 
quake to "roll" the cooks out of their kitchens at 
Pompeii, and required an eruption of Vesuvius to 
make the bakers forget their bread in their ovens at 
Herculaneum, but that was in grander times than 
these, and it is not exceeding the truth to say that 
this sad fugitive from the modern Athens was im- 
pelled to sever his connection through no greater 
reason than the vacuity of his perceptions of the in- 
herent possibilities of fried mush. Perhaps you 
think that after he was gone all was peace, and joy, 
and love, but it was not. His successor's mush was 

orthodox and irreproachable, but 

Well, there were some old habitues who had con- 
ceived an affection for the other kind, they did not 
know what made the diflference, but there was a 
solid sweetness in the other that the new kind did 
not possess. The new cook did not understand it 
either, for he only knew one way ; so they split the 
slices and double breaded them, and tried to make 
believe, and worried along, and I think they are all 
dead by this time and out of their troubles, but if 
ever you get into such a place after learning the fol- 
lowing receipt, you will know what they want, bet- 
ter than they know themselves. 



64T. 



Pried Mush Balls, or Pried Pone. 



1 pound of corn meal. 

1 pint of boiling water. 

4 tablespoonfuls of melted lard. 

1 egg. ^ cup cold water. Salt. 

Scald the meal with the boiling water ; add the 
rest of the ingredients ; flour your hands ; make 
round balls, and fry in a saucepan of hot lard. They 
require long cooking. 



No doubt it could be easily demonstrated that four 
cooks in a hotel kitchen accomplish more in the culi- 
nary line than do forty domes ic cooks in twenty pri- 
vate houses. No particular credit to the hotel cooks, 
but it is owing to the larger scale and system of their 
work, the greater capacities of their ranges and uten- 
sils, the labor-saving conveniences, water and drain- 
age arrangements, and the larger quantities handled. 
It takes but little longerto cook five pounds than one, 
scarcely more trouble to make a gallon of soup for 
twenty persons than a quart for a family. But the 
emergencies are many, too. There has to be a drop^ 
ping oflf and leaving out of many long and tedious 
processes. That which cannot be made in short time, 
is most likely not to be made at all, or else attempted 
and spoiled. 

There are printed directions for numerous articles 
apparently desirable, that must be constantly stirred 
or otherwise worked one or two hours. To follow 



such in hotel work is simply impossible, it would re- 
quire a small army of assistants. The common objec- 
tion is valid — '*0, we can't — there isn't time." The 
choice, then, lies between making many cheap and 
good preparations in a half-way manner; giving them 
up entirely, or finding out the reason why of the long 
processes and getting at the same results by shorter 
methods. There will be, it is hoped, many better il- 
lustrations than this of corn meal puddings, yet this 
will serve, and may the sooner establish an under- 
standing of the motive of many directions that might 
otherwise seem peculiar. It is commonly said that 
corn meal puddings must bake three hours or longer, 
but in a hotel doing a healthy business it is extremely 
inconvenient to keep one minor article, and one so 
liable to burn, in the oven for that length of time 
Fishes and meats have to go m and out, then vegeta- 
bles and pastry; three hours baking involves three 
hours watching, and the strain upon memory lest it be 
neglected. There is no need of this. The only rea- 
son for long cooking is to cook the meal thoroughly, 
and that is better done in a saucepan with a lid on in 
any out-of-the-way corner, or even in a sink in the 
steam chest. To bake a pudding longer than till the 
eggs are well set, is generally an injury. What is at 
a certain point rich, smooth and custard-like, be- 
comes, with longer baking, watery and inferior, 
through the curdling of the eggs, just as is seen to 
happen when a custard is allowed to boil. Cook the 
materials as much as you please before the eggs are 
put in, but very little after. 

Several puddings of corn meal have already been 
described, the next is a plainer and cheaper sort. 
Not necessarily the worse for that — it is mere matter 
of taste. 

048. 

Plain Baked Indian Pudding. 



2 quarts of water, or milk. 
12 ounces of corn meal. 

2 ounces of butter, or suet. 

6 ounces of molasses (a tea cupful). 

1 teaspoonful of ground ginger. 

4 eggs. Little salt. 

Make mush with the meal and water, and let it 
simmer about 2 hours. Then add the other ingredi- 
ents and bake in a buttered milk pan nearly an hour. 
Makes 2h quarts. 



049. Common Brown Bread, Yeast 
Raised. 

1 pound of corn meal about 3 cupfuls. 

1 pint of boiling water — 2 cupfuls. 

^ cupful of black molasses. 

1 cupful of cold water. 

1 cupful of yeast, or a yeast cake in water. 

^ pound of either rye or graham flour. 

^ pound of white flour, a heaping pint. 

Salt. 

Pour ihe boiling water over the corn meal in a

pan and mix, throw in a teaspoonful of salt, add 
the molasses and cold water, then the yeast and 
then the two kinds of flour. Line two sheet-iron 
brown bread pails with greased paper, put in the 
dough and let rise from one to two hours, then 
bake or steam for five hours. If steamed, bake the 
loaves afterward long e'nough to form a slight crust. 
A good sort of bread is made as above with a 
pound of graham sifted through a common flour 
sieve to remove the coarse bran, and the white flour 
omitted; or with all rye flour and no graham or 
white. Care should be tali en not to scald the yeast 
by adding it to the hot meal before the cold water. 
When this kind of bread is sticky when sliced it 
shows it was made up too wet. When the loaves 
come out hollow or caved in ii shows too much fer- 
mentation. 



650. English Home-Made Brown Bread. 

3 pounds of sifted graham flour. 

1 quart of warm water. 

^ ounce of compressed yeast 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

By sifted graham is meant flour with the coarsest 
bran taken out. Commence 7 or 8 hours before 
time to bake. Dissolve the yeast in the water and 
mix up half the flour with it, that is "setting 
sponge." Place the pan in a warm corner, to re- 
main 4 hours. Then throw in the salt, mix up to 
stiff dough, scrape out the pan and knead smooth. 
Brush over the pan with the least possible amount 
of melted lard, or lard and hot water to prevent 
slicking, put in the lump of dough and brush it 
over, and let rise 2 hours more. Then knead, make 
into loaves, rise again and bake. 

Where potato yeast is used instead of compressed, 
take about one-fourth as much yeast as water. 

The foregoing is the kind of bread fashionably 
served with stewed slices of fish. 

651. Rhubard Marmalade for Tarts. 

Rhubarb flavored with oranges and boiled down 
With sugar. 

4 cupfuls of rhubarb cut very small. 

2 cupfuls of sugar. 

3 oranges— or orange peel only. 

Grate the yellow rind of the oranges into the 
saucepan and then cut up the insides, carefu'ly ex- 
cluding the sreds and white pith. Put in a spoon- 
ful or two of water to wet the bottom, then the sugar 
and rhubirb, and simmer at the back of the range 
with the lid on for an hour. Keep in a jar. Use 
to fill tarts or spread between layers of cake. 



652. Marmalade of Canned Apricots. 

2 cupfuls of sugar to 2 cupfuls of apricot pulp. 
Drain the fruit from the syrup by pouring all into 



a colander set in a saucepan. Press the frui 
through the colander into another vessel and mea- 
sure it. Put as much sugar by measure into the ap 
ricot juice in the saucepan and boil them gently for 
half an hour, skimming once; then put in the 
mashed apiicot and simmer down thick. 



652 a. Pumpkin Butter— Pine Quality. 

2 pounds or pints of dry mashed pumpkin. 

1 pound of sugar. 4 ounces of butter. 

Flavoring either of shaved lemon rind, cloves, 
nutmeg or race ginger. 

The pumpkin must be dry, either baked or steam- 
ed. Mash it through a strainer, mix the sugar and 
butter with it and the piece of ginger bruised, or 
thin shaved lemon rind; let simmer at the s^de or 
set upon bricks on the stove for perhaps an hour. 
It becomes thick and semi-transparent; can be kept 
in jars in a dark place. Good for the same uses as 
fruit Jellies and marmalade. 



652 b. Peach Butter. 

8 cupfuls of sliced peaches. 

4 cupfuls of sugar. 

2 cupfuls of water. 
The peaches need not be peeled, but should be 
rubbed in a coarse towel before slicing. 

Put the water into a kettle or bright pan; then the 
peaches; shut in the steam and let cook at the back 
of the stove,or set on bricks, for an hour or longer* 
Then add the sug'tr, and do not leave it, as it burns 
very easi'y, but keep stirring with a broad wooden 
paddle while it boils one-half hour more. Keep in 
ajar in a cool place. 



652 c. Caterers* Wedding Cake. 

2 pounds of su^ar. 

1^ pounds of butter. 

12 eggs. 2 pounds of flour. 

8 tablespoonfuls of wine. Same of brandy. 

6 nutmegs ground or grated. 

5 pounds of raisins. 

4 pounds of currants. 

2 pounds of citrons. 
Stone the raisin?, wash and dry tke currants, 
cut the citron email, then mix all three together 
and dust them with a cupful of flour. 

Mix the first four ingredients together the same 
as if for pound cake, add the liquors, nutmeg, and 
then the fruit. 

Line the mold with buttered paper, and wrap 
another paper around the outside and tie it with 
twine. Bake the cake about three hours. 



652 d. Layer Fruit Cake. 

Sheets of pound cake mixlure baked in jelly cake 
pans; minced raisins, citron, almonds and currants 
mixed with icing and spread between. 



166 



THE AMEBIOAN PASTBY OOOK. 



653. Pound Oake. 



14 or 15 ounces of sugar. 

12 ounces of butter. 

10 eggs. 

1 pound of flour. 

Warm the butter and sugar together slightly and 
work them with a spoon till creamy and white. Add 
the eggs 2 at a time, and then the flour in 3 or 4 
portions. Beating the batter after all the ingredi- 
ents are in tends to make the cake fine grained. 
Pound cake should not be flavored. 



Pound cake, doubtless is so called, because it can 
be m^.de with a pound of each of the ingredients. The 
10 egg^ weigh a pound. But so much butter makes 
it too rich to be good eating. 



664. Pound Fruit Oake. 

The staple every day sort of plum cake. The fruit 
does not sink to the bottom in this mixture. 

14 ounces of sugar. 

14 ounces of butter. 

11 eggs. 

18 ounces of flour. 

Mix the above the same as pound cake, then add 
to it: 

2 teaspoonfuls of mixed ground spices, cinnamon, 
mace, and alspice. 

1 lemon, grated rind, and juice. 

1 pound of raisins. 

1 pound of currants. 

8 ounces of citron. 

Half cupful of whisky (optional). 

U^e seedless raisins. Nothing is good made full 
of raisin seeds. Mix the fruit together and dust it 
with flour before stirring it into the batter. The 
cakes require from 1 to 1^ hourdto bake. 

655. Citron Cake. 

Either of the preceding pound cake mixtures with 
1 pound of citron cut in shreds and added, and a 
little lemon extract. 



050. Wedding: Cake— Rich Fruit Cake. 



1 pound of sugar. 

IJ pounds of butter. 

10 eggs. 

IJ pounds of flour. 

Mix the above like pound cake, then add 

IJ pounds of seedless raisins. 

IJ pounds of currants. 

1 pound of citron. 

8 ounces of almonds, blanched. 

1 tablespoonful of mixed ground spices. 

Half pint of brandy. 

1 lemon, juice and grated rind. 



Bake in molds lined with buttered paper. Takes 
from 1 to 2 hours according to depth. This cake 
cannot be cut while fresh without crumbling, but 
becomes moister and Arm with a few days keeping. 

657. Richest Fruit Cake— Black Cake* 



Prepare the fruit first. 
2^ pounds of seedless raisins. 
2^ pounds of clean dry currants. 
IJ pounds of citron, shred fine. 
2 ounces of mixed ground spices — cinnamon, 
cloves, nutmeg and mace. 

1 small cupfrl of strong black coffee. 
1 small cupful of reboiled molasses. 
1 small cupful of brandy. 

I tablespoonful of extract of lemon. 

A small addition of almonds, nuts, candy, or out 
figs can be made if wished. 
Then mix the cake batter : 
14 ounces of sugar. 
14 ounces of butter. 

II eggs. 

18 ounces of flour. 

Mix up same as poundcake, after the flour is all 
in add the 2 ounces of spice, then the coffee, molas- 
ses, brandy and lemon extract. The batter will then 
be quite thin. Dust the fruit well with flour and 
and mix it in. 

Line two cake molds with buttered paper and di- 
vide the mixture into them. Set the molds in the 
middle of a sheet or two of greased paper, gather it 
up around them and tie with twine, thus wrapping 
the molds in paper to shield them from too much 
heat and avoid burning the fruit. Bake from 2 to 
2^ hours in a slack oven. 

658. The black cake above should be at least 2 
or 3 days old before it is cut. The amount of cake 
batter only serves to hold vhe fruit together, but, it 
ought to be mentioned, the quantity of the pound 
cake mixture in it may be doubled and all the other 
inzredients remain the same and it will still be a 
very rich black cake. 



659. .Mountain Cakes. 



Pound cake baked on jelly cake pans, 4 or 5 or 
more of the sheets piled on each other with cake icing 
spread between, and on the top. Decorate the top 
with the kernels of hickory nuts. 



660. Drop Cakes. 



Pound cake mixture, or butter sponge cake mix* 
ture with a handful or two of flour added and a little 
baking powder placed by spoonfuls on greased baking 
pans make the cone shaped drop cakes of the shops. 
A strip of citron, a few currants or granulated sugar 
on top make the variations.

663. Sugar Oake Made Without Eggs- 

8 ounces of sugar. 
4 ounces of butter. 

1 large coffee cupful of milk. 
Nutmeg to flavor, or carraway seeds. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder, 
1^ pounds of flour. 

Mix up like biscuit, the butter melted and added 
to the milk with the sugar, Roll out and bake in a 
shallow pan. Brush over with milk before baking. 



664. Cookies, Sugar Cakes. Best. 

1 pound of sugar, 

1 pound of butter, 

12 eggs. 

3 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Flour to make soft dough— 3 pounds. 

Cream the butter and sugar together the same as 
for pound oake. Beat the eggs and mix them in, 
then the powder, add some flavoripg, then flour. Let 
the dough, after it has been worked smooth, stand a 
few minutes before rolling it out. Sift sugar over 
the sheet of dough before cutting out the cakes.

in muffin rings and iced on top with cocoanut mixed 
in the icing. 



668. German Cookies. 



Make cookies of either of the mixtures and after 
placing in pans egg them over with a brush and 
sprinkle on them chopped almonds mixed with 
gravel sugar. Bake light colored. Gravel sugar is 
the small lumps from crushed sugar sifted through 
a colander. 



669, Jumbles. 

Are cookies in ring shapes, of various degrees of 
richness of mixture. Commonly they are only cut 
in rings with a ring cutter; properly they should be 
made with a sack and tube. 

• Take a lady-finger tube and file the edge into saw 
teeth and press out the jumble dough in a ribbed 
cord, of which form rings on the baking pans. The 
cooky mixtures may be used, or this : 

1 pound of sugar. 
12 ounces of butter. 

8 eggs. Flavor of lemon or orange. 

2 pounds or little less of flour. 
No powder.

It is generally best to make the dough for all kinds 
of cookies and sugar cake as soft as it can possibly 
be rolled out. Diff^erent persons make very differen*

cakes of these sorts from the same receipts, and the 
common fault is too much flour in the dough. The 
baking powder too is responsible for some of the 
changes. With too much powder the cakes run 
into each other and lose the good round shape they 
ought to baye.

Place on buttered pans with plenty of room between. 
Bake light. 



674. Sugar Cakes without Eggs. 

8 ounces of butter. 

8 ounces of sugar. 

8 ounces of water — a cupful. 

2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

1^ pounds of flour to mix, and more to roll out. 
Mix in the order they are printed. The softer the 
dough can be handled the better the cakes will be. 
Sift sugar over before cutting out. 



675. Brandy Snaps 



1 pound of flour. 
8 ounces of butter. 
8 ounces of sugir. 

2 ounces of ground ginger. 
Lemon extract to flavor. 

1 teaepoonful of soda — rounded measure. 

1^ pounds of light molasses. 

Rub the butter into the flour as in making short 
paste, and add the ginger. Make a hole in the mid- 
dle of the flour and put in the sugar, molasses and 
extract ; dissolve the soda in a spoonful of water 



and add it to the rest. Stir all together, drawing 
in the flour gradually while stirring. 

Drop this batter with a teaspoon on baking pans 
— they need not be greased — and bake in a slack 
oven. The snaps run out flat and thin. Take them 
off before they get cold and- bend them to round or 
tubular shape on a new broom handle. 



676. Soft Ginger Nuts. 

Make the dough as for brandy snaps, and add to 
it 8 ounces more flour. Roll it out to a thick sheet 
and cut out with a small cutter. 

681. How to Make Stock Yeast. 



There are two parts to this process, requiring 
about 5 days time before new ferment can be made 
from the new stock. But as stock will keep at 
least a month and much longer if bottled and kept 
in the ice-house, the trouble does not recur very 
often. The first part is: 



682. 



Bottle Yeast. The Beginning of 
Yeast. 



Get a strong quart bottle, an ale or champagne 
bottle will da. Make some strong hop tea by boil- 
ing a large handful of hops in a quart of water, 
cool it and strain it into the bottle, squeezing the 
hops dry to get the full strength. The bottle must 
only be two thirds full. Then put into the bottle, be- 
sides, two handfuls of ground malt and one handful 
of sugar. Shake up, cork, and tie the cork down 
with twine, like ginger-pop. Set the bottle on a 
warm shelf in a corner of the kitchen where it will 
not be disturbed and will not be in danger of getting 
too warm in the heat of the day. Let it stand there 
from 44 to 48 hours, by which time it will be yeast 
on a small scale, ready to start fermentation in the 
stock itself. 



683. Second Part. Stock Yeast. 



The bottle having stood long enough — or two 
days after corking it down — make about 2 gallons 
of hop tea by putting a pail of water into a kettle 
with a lot of hops — nearly a pound — and boiling 
them about an hour with a lid on the kettle. Put 2 
pounds of flour into a large jar, pan, or keg and 
strain some of the boiling hop water into it — enough 
to wet and scald the flour thoroughly when stirred 
up ; when there are no more lumps in the flour 
strain in all the rest of the hop water and cool it 
with a piece of ice. After that put in a quart of 
coarse ground malt and J pound of suf^ar. When 
this mixture is no more than milk warm, take the 
bottle yeast, hold the neck downwards and o^efuUy 
draw the cork — which will come out like the cork 



THE AMBBICAN PASTRY COOK,

from a bottle of champagne — and mix the two 
together. Set the jar or keg containing the 
stock in a warm corner where it may ferment 
undisturbed, and in a day and a half or two days 
afterwards the stock will be ready to start 
ferment with, as has already been directed at 
number 512. 

It is not necessary to make the bottle yeast 
every time that stock is made, for new stock may 
be started with some of the old stock remaining, 
but whenever the ferment seems weak and slow, 
and whenever the bread begins to turn sour be- 
fore it is light, then new stock should be started 
from the very foundation, in the bottle. 

It may be observed that the above method 
renders a person who can get the raw materials 
quite independent of every other person's yeast 
and of an J other kind of yeast to start with He 
makes his own from the very first germ. 



684. Genuine Vienna Rolls. 

4 pounds of flour. 

1 quart of milk. 

1 ounce of German compressed yeast. 

1 ounce of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of sugar, 

Make the milk lukewarm and dissolve the yeast 
in it. Set sponge at 9 in the morning, at noon add 
the salt and sugar and make up stiff dough. Let 
rise till about 4. Then work the dough well on the 
table by pressing out and folding over. 

Roll out the dough in one large sheet as thin as 
you can, which will be about the thinness of a din- 
ner plate edge ; then measuring with your hand cut 
the dough into strips or bands as wide across as your 
hand is long. Cut these again into triangular pieces 
for rolls, not equal sided but long and narrow tri- 
angles. Roll these triangular pieces up, beginning 
at the broad bottom end, and the point will come up 
in the middle, and there will be a spiral mark 
aiound from end to end. 

Give each roll a few turns under the hands to 
smooth it and place it on the baking pan in the form 
of a crescent— ju3t the shape and size of the new 
moon. Brush over with water. Let rise in the 
pans about half an hour and bake about ten minutes 




Genuine Vienna Rolls 



Some time ago the writer saw a Vienna Model 
Bakery — so called— begin and flourish awhile, and 
at last go into bankruptcy in an attempt to introduce 
and make the above described rolls popular in a 
community that had but little appreciation of their 
excellence. For one thing it cost the firm $2.50 per 
week for compressed yeast alone, to arrive on oer. 
tain days by express, when they might have made 
the common kind at a scarcely appreciable cost. 

The lesson is: German bread for the Germans* 
but Vienna rolls cannot be forced into the position 
of favoritism that is held by Parker House or Albany 
rolls, or split rolls by any other name. Make the 
Vienna shape, however, out of French roll dough. 
Brush over the sheet of dough with a little melted 
butter, then roll up the rolls, and after baking they 
they can be unrolled, and the people who eat will 
admire them. 



685, Baker's Apple Oake. 



A sheet of the coffee cake dough (No. 540) covered 
with apples in slices stuck In edgewise and, after a 
little time allowed for it to rise, baked in a slack 
oven. Plain bread or roll dough is sometimes made 
to serve the purpose at the bakeries, and the apples 
are basted while baking with syrup and dredged 
with cinnamon. 

A Plea for the Pastry Cook. 

'* In the time of Charles IX. of France, pastry 
cooks made such advance that the products of their 
industry held an honorable place in every feast ; and 
they formed a considerable corporation, for we find 
that prince investing it with certain privileges.*' So 
says our most respected advocate and authority, and 
continues: "It is easy to entertain a large number 
of healthy appetites; with plenty of meat, venison, 
game, and some large pieces of fish, a feast for sixty 
is soon ready. But to please mouths that only open 
in affectation, to tempt women full of fancies, to 
excite stomachs of papier mache^ or rouse an appe- 
tite which is ever flickering in the socket, would 
require more genius, insight, and labor than the res- 
olution of one of the problems of the Geometry of 
the Infinite.'* 

The pastry cook's occupation ought at least to 
rank equal to the meat cook's in the organization of 
the working force of a hotel. If it at present is 
held subordinate the reason may be found in the 
binding force of inherited customs; for the meat 
cook's office has existed ever since men first began 
to slay animals and toast their flesh over the camp 
fire for food, while the pastry cook's is a later out- 
growth of the highest civilization. But having the 
more delicate and difficult tasks to perform it de- 
mands for their perfect execution a rarer kind of 
alent, Almosf any person of ordinary shrewdnesf

THE AMERICAN PASTBY COOK. 



and apitude casually thrown for awhile amongst the 
cooks in a hotel may set up with a fair cbanco of 
succeeding as a meat cook himself in the vastly pre- 
ponderating number of places where cheapness has 
to be the first consideration, and from that may eas- 
ily reach the more lucrative positions ; but first-class 
pastry-cooks, cannot be made in that way, for pas- 
try cooking, including bread making and baking, is 
a more exact trade, a matter depending upon weights 
and measures and a particular manipulations, not to 
be trusted to guess work without long previous 
practice. The products of the meat cook's labor are 
set before people prepared for their enjoyment with 
appetites sharpened by hunger. The cook, and the 
steward of practiced taste may discern in the soup 
a slight burnt or smoky or unpleasant flavor, yet 
the entire company will probably parlake of it with 
enjoyment without perceiving any thing amiss ; but 
after the keen appetites have been appeased let 
something of the pastry cook's be sent to table burd- 
ened with a similar inferiority and it will be imme- 
diately and almost unanimously rejected. It used to 
be the frequent remark of a very successful hotel- 
keeper, that "people take more notice of the pastry 
than of any other part of the dinner." The charac* 
ter of the table is more apt to be judged by the 
quality of the products of the pastry cook's labor, 
including the warm breads, waffles, and cakes, than 
by anything else, and if the working man or woman 
of the culinary department is possessed of taste and 
perception in a superior degree their quality can no- 
where be 80 well displayed as in the last course of 
a dinner upon the dainty dishes that are set about to 
beir comparsion and to hold their place if they may 
among the rich fruits and nuts, the wines, the flowers 
of the dessert. 

But if the pastry cook's art may claim considera- 
tion because of its capacity for contributing to what 
is delicate, elegant, and ornate, it has even greater 
claims on the score of usefulness. Up and down the 
crowded streets of one of the largest and busiest cities 
— Chicag:)to-wIt — at frequent intervals may be found 
restaurants with all sorts of meats, fish and fowls 
displayed with their garnlshings in the most tempt- 
ing manner possible ; and between them and twic3 
as frequent are the beer halls with their lunch dis- 
played, more or less free, of boiled meat, tripe, 
chopped cvbbage and rye bread, the indications 
seeeming to be that all the men are eaters only of 
meat and its "trimmings." But not sa. There are 
other places where men lunch and dine. There are 



bakeries in Chicago which are in reality large facto- 
ries, as extensive as seme pork packing establish- 
ments, and these making specialties of pies, bread, 
cakes, or crackers seem — if we may be allowed to 
make a rough guess — to supply about one-fourth of 
the entire city. These large bakeries have shops for 
retailing, large double stores in the heart of the city, 
converted into lunch houses with long counters and 
rows of stools, and waiters, clerks and cashiers, 
and they are crowded during about two hours 
of each meal time about six hours of the day, 
with men taking a meal of bread cakes, pies and cof- 
fee, tea, or milk. Nothing is cooked there except the 
coffee made by steam heat. They serve French split 
rolls and round graham rolls with butter, three for 
five centSj in little baskets ; coffee-cakes made up in 
twists like one of our cuts, and brushed over with 
syrup, two for five cents ; yellow rusks in long shape 
like rolls; Boston brown bread, very brown and 
baked in pails, or deep molds same shape. Apple 
cake they have, and "stollen," and "Lincoln pie," 
here called *' Washington pie;" small sponge cakes 
baked in pans the length of a finger, also lady- 
fingers, one cent apiece; milk bread baked in long 
tin molds, plum cake, baked "apple dumplings," 
and pies; homemade pies, with pumpkin and 
custard thick, even up to the brim, lemon pie with 
meringue on top, mince and apple. 

Our interest in this matter is that of a theorist 
liking to find his beliefs verified. Meat is the most 
expensive and wasteful article of hotel provision. 
We have found in hotels that in proportion as the 
breads and other articles included under the head of 
pastries rose in excellence the demand upon the 
meats was lessened, to the benefit, probably, of all 
concerned. The products of these large city baker- 
ies are good with the uniform excellence that might 
be expected of factory work and because they are good 
the sales are immense. The lunch or meal of this 
kind costs but from ten to thirty cents, yet its 
cheapness is not its only recommendation, for the 
crowds of customers are not of the tramping class ; 
they are the foremen and workmen of the huge ware- 
houses near by, the compositors, machinists, clerks, 
salesmen, tradesmen and professional men who prac- 
tice the dietetic moralities. Good bread, good butter, 
and good coffee — has it not almost passed into a pro- 
verb that these are the first requisites to an excellent 
table? and taking the country over, away from the 
very large bakeries and the very best hotels are there 
any articles seldomer to be found? 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK.

685. 



Fairy Butter. 



The yolkf of 4 hard boiled eggs. 

1 teacupful of the best butter. 

3 heaping tablespoonfuls powdered sugar. 

1 teaspoonful orange flower water. 

Either grate the yolks or pound and rub them 
smooth in a bowl, mix the softened butter with them 
and the sugar and flavoring. Set the mixture where 
it will get cold, and afterward rub it through a 
sieve. It looks something like vermicelli. 

Pile the fairy butter lightly in the middle of a cake 
dish, cut the snow cake in slices and lay around. 
They are to be eaten together like bread and butter. 



686. 



Apple Souffle. 



On account of the scarcity of culinary terms, the 
word soufflle has to stand for a great number of 
light articles that may have very little resemblance 
to each other. This consists of a border of dry 
stewed apple raised in a large dish or an ice cream 
saucer, as the case may be, the hollow middle filled 
with boiled custard and whipped white of egg and 
sugar, like the frosting on lemon pies, piled on top. 
It need not be baked, but the top may be browned 
by holding a red hot shovel over it on the shelf in 
the oven. Served cold. 

681. Egrg Lemonade for Fifty. 

8 quarts of water — a tin milk pail full. 

8 pounds of sugar — 6 or 7 cupfuls. 

2 dozen lemons. 

2 oranges. 

8 or 10 whites of eggs. 

Shaved or broken ice. 

Grate the rinds of 8 or 10 of the lemons and the 
oranges into a large bowl, using a tin grater, and take 
less or more, according to the size and degree of 
ripeness or greenness of the fruit. Scrape off the 
grated rind that adheres. Put a little sugar in the 
bowl, and rub the zest and sugar together with the 
back of a spoon. Squeeze in the juice of all, add 
W sugar and some water and then the whites of 
eggs, and beat the mixture till the sugar is dissolved ; 
put in water to make the specified amount and 
strain the lemonade into another vessel containing 
ice. 

When to be served fill a glass three parts full, in- 
vert another on top, the rims close together, and 
shake up to make the foam. 



688. 



Plain Lemonade. 



Three or four lemons, according to size, and a 
small cup of sugar to a quart of water. Slice th^ 
lemons into the water beforehand, and let stand. 
Put shaved ice in the glasses before filling. 



Clear lemonade can be obtained by filtering it, 
when made, through blotting paper folded to fit in 
a glass funnel. 



080. 



Catawaba Oup. 



To each bottle of dry catawba allow two bottles 
of soda water and a quarter pint of curacoa, mix in 
a pitcher, and add ice abundantly. If not conveni- 
ent to get bottled soda, use water and sugar or 
lemonade to mix with the wine and liqueur. 

690. Tea for a Large Party. 

To make what tea-drinkers call a real good cup of 
tea take nearly a teaspoonful of green tea for each 
cup, or 4 teaspoonfuls to 5 cups of water, the leaves 
absorbing 1 cup. But then there is a second draw- 
ing that brings this out. 

Four ounces of tea contain 28 teaspoonfuls or 2 
cupfuls, rounded np. Using mixed tea, and allow- 
ing time to draw to draw 2 cupfuls of tea is sufficient 
to put into 40 cups of water, or a quarter-pound of 
tea to 2^ gallons of water, which is the same thing 
in other words. 

The best way to make tea for a number is to have 
the water boiling in an urn and put the tea in a box 
made of perforated tin and drop it into the water, 
which must then be stopped from boiling. 



691. 



White Ooflfee. 



Is made with coffee that, instead of being browned, 
is only baked to a slight yellow color and is not 
ground, or at most the berries are only bruised, and 
is made with one-half milk and one-half water. It 
requires twice as much coffee as the ordinary. 

For 8 cups t ke : 

2 cupfuls of light baked coffee berries. 

4 cupfuls of boiling water. 

5 cupfuls of boiling milk. 

The berries may have been parched before, but 
when wanted heat them over again and throw them 
hot into the boiling water. Close the lid and let 
stand to draw for half an hour, then add the boiling 
milk through a strainer. 

When the milk is first set on to boil, put in a 
tablespoonfal or two of sugar to prevent burning at 
the bottom. Serve sugar with the coffee as usual, 
and, if for a party, a spoonful of whipped cream in 
each cup. | 



69Ia. 



Chocolate. 



1 quart of milk and water. 

4 ounce of chocolate. 

Boil the milk and water in a small, bright sauce- 
pan. Scrape down an ounce as marked on the half 
pound cakes of common chocolate, throw it in and 
beat with a wire egg whisk about one minute, or till 
the chocolate is all dissolved.

THE HOTEL BOOK OP SALADS. 

* And light words spoken 
Only for something to say.** 
Whatever other matters may have been already 
writtea to death there is, it is plain to see, a great 
dearth of writers on the subject of salads, at least in 
our own langung"; it seems as if this had been re- 
garded as a foreigQ affair and not of home interest 
at all. The things, consequently, that never have 
been written but ought to be would, if written, fill a 
very much larger volume than this is intended to 
be, and lest our title seem to promise too much it 
may be proper to say we are not going to try to take 
them all in. However, in the way of practical salad 
making, we will try to crowd into small space 
nearly everything that can be pressed into the hotel 
service, the herbs and fruits that are taken like some 
people's statements, cum grano salts, with many an- 
other 

• '—rich herbaceous treat 
Might tempt a dying anchorite to eat. " 

and enough cf tbe ornamental f^r extra occasions. 
The daily bill of fare writer, whatever other ofl&ce 
mny be his, who, tired of repeating the three or four 
stock salads, si's running his fingers through his 
hair and w mdering what in the nstjoa Le shall 
write next, will very likely find in the following 
lists just the suggestion he wants, for the very good 
reason that they have been prepared and adapted 
under extremely similar circumstances. We wish 
to offer a set of instructions valuable to hotel econo- 
mists, to those who take pride in their table, per 
hips to hotel working boys and girls who have their 
living to make, for common labor is plenty and 
abject enough; it is tkill that wins the good posi- 
tions and good pay, but skill that can adapt itself, 
skill to do that which everyone else in the house 
may be deficient in, even sometimes to make brick 
wiihout straw, to make salad sans oil. Bans celery, 
sans chicken, sans everything that most people deem 
essential. 

But when it com^s to the salad-making of the 
veritable gistronomer, tbe scientific epicure, the 
avowed dinuer giving and dinner taiiiog bon vivant, 
it is time f.r us hotel workers to lay down the pen 
end shut up — the book. Not that we think the best 
if our tr^de salids inferior, but because he is sure 
that his are and must be incomparably above (hem. 



together a sufficient variety of materials for our 
ea' ad-making, let us to work. 

G92, Mayonaise Salad Dressinsf. 



*' Three times the spoon with oil of Lucca crow% 

And once with vinegar procured from town." 

3 or 4 raw yolks of eggs. 

1 teacupful of olive oil. 

About half as much vinegar. 

A teaspoonful of salt. 

Drop the yolks into a bowl, soup plate, or deep, 
bright saucepan, add about as much oil and stir 
them together with a wooden spoon — or any other 
kind of a spoon — for a minute or two, then com- 
mence beating and add oil a tablespoonful at a time. 
After five minutes stirring and beating, the oil being 
more than half in, throw in the salt and begin ad- 
ding the vinigar also by spoonfuls. On the addition 
of the salt the mayonaise will be very likely to 
thicken up at once and the vinegar is required to 
reduce it, as well as for flavor. 

The above is the way of making plain, straight- 
forward mayonaise that is practiced by cooks and 
their assistants daily all over the country, and being 
such a very simple operation there is no wonder if 
they do not see the reason for making so much ado 
about it. It takes ten or fifteen minutes to bring it 
to the proper consistence. There might be diflficulty 
ifthe ingredients were warm; as a matter of habit 
cooks always keep the oil in a cold place. In hot 
weather set the bowl in ice water. Mayonaise of 
the required thickness cannot probably be made 
with a smaller proportion of oil, but the same yolks 
will take up much more if need be, 

693. 

A quicker way than the foregoing is : Place the 

yolks in a deep quart bowl — set in ice water, if 
warm weather — add a spoonful of oil and whip with 
a Dover egg beater. In half a minute add more oil, 
then the salt, and the mixture will at once become 
like bu'ter. Keep thinning with oil and vinegar as 
in the other case^ three proportions of oil to one of 
vinegar. 



694. Uses of the Mayonaise. 



The mayonaise when right is like softened butter, 
only more tenacious— too thick to run. It is to be 
spread smoothly over the top of the pile or shape of 
salad material, over the fillet of fish or form of lob- 
ster or shrimp, or over the whole fish — giving a 
glossy yellow surface to be ornamented as desired. 
It is to be eaten with the salad material as butter 
would be. Sometimes for ornamental purposes it is 
stirred into the too loose material to make taller 
shapes. 

It is to be mixed with about an equal amount of

THE AMERICAN COOK. 



aspic jelly — (the jelly being cold enough \o be ju3t 
on the point of setting) to form coli tartar sauce — 
a yell>w, flavored acid jelly. Also mixed with 
different p eparations it makes sauces or dressings 
of other colors — emerald green and cardinal 
red. Besidei these employments it is used in the 
form of 

005* SALAD CaEAM, OB THIN MAYONAISE. 

Reduce the thick mayonaise to the consistency of 
cream by adding m re vinegar or vioegar and water 
— in some cases milk or cream — and if you wish to 
be particular use some clear strained chicken broth 
(c -Id) or unseasoned soup stock with the vinegar, 
instead of water. For lobster and other shell fish, 
however, all vinegar may be used, as they take away 
its sharpness. This salad cream used as a sauce 
makes almost any kind of vegetable, meat and fish 
palatable and relishing if served with it cold and 
crisp. 



Palatable, that is, to those who do not dislike 
olive oil. And some of your people will make the 
thin mayonaise for themselves. Some will choose 
their dinner in courses even from an American form 
bill of fare, and sa'ads are as ''familiar in their 
mouths as household words." Seeing you have 
mayonaise they are apt to order it plain and wiih 
the condiment s and relishes before them make their 
rwn varia ions on their own plates. 

My Italian friend who almost invariably for his 
own meals makes a salad, or at least something akin 
to salad, with oil poured over, looks askance at the 
vinegar and remarks : ''Along the shores of the 
Mt diterraneau the people, the wealthy people, the 
mercantile people, do not use vinegar more than to 
the amount of a squeeze of a lemon — it is the com 
mon people, the people of the interior, tl:e peasants 
(and he shrugs his shoulders contemptuouslj) only 
the peasants who pour vi icgar plentifully over their 
green stuff and call it ealad '* A remark which 
may serve to give the right hang of that Spanish 
proverb about ealad-making: "A spendthrift for 
oil, a niggaid for vinegar, and a madman to mix the 
salad toge her " For there are those who think the 
one who p urs-in any oil at all is the madman, and 
at any rate think it will be better to let the spend- 
thrift donate the vinegtr instead of the oil. There 
are a so motives of ec nomy iu favor of the wrorg 
reading; but we cooks are perfectly disinterested 
and had just as lief make our dressing without oil 
as not. 



The following, if a rather large quantity for fifty 
persons for dinner, is not too much for a supper 
ealad on a hot summ^^r evening, when the thought 
alone of all other food is wearisome disgust. 



696. Hollandaise Salad Cream. 



^ pint of good white wine vinegar. 

^ pint scant of water, 

8 ounces of butter. 
12 yolks of eggs. 

1 tablespoonful made mustard. 

A pinch of cayenne. Salt. 

Boil the vinegar, water, and salt and butter all 
together in a bright saucepan. Beat the yolks a 
little, add some of the boiling liquid and stir them 
together, then mix all and let come to the boiling 
point. It is on the same principal as making cus- 
tard. If allowed to thoroughly boil it will curdle, 
and have to be thrown away; if taken off too soon it 
will not be rich and thick enough One minute of 
stirring after the yolks are added is usually enough. 
Strain and set on ice to be cold for use. 



The preceding will be found eminently satisfactory 
and can be used in almost every place that 
mayonaise would be employed. It can be made 
thicker or thinner as required, but when thinned 
must be rapidly beaten and the liquid — water or 
broth and vinegar — added by degrees, otherwise the 
dressing may separate and the butter come to the 
top. This, however, seldom occurs. 

It is generally an object to have mayonaise creamy 
white, for which purpose lemon juice is added to it, 
but the hollandaise dressing is golden yellow, an<i 
the better for vegetable salads like the following, 
which have no good looks of their own. 



60Y. 



Lima Beans Salad. 



2 quarts of cooked lima or butter beans. 

A small onion. 

A little chopped parsley. 

The hollandaise salad oream of the preceding r^ 
ceipt. 

Mince the onion small. Mix all the ingredients 
together by pouring from one bowl to another, ex- 
cept the parsley, which chop and sprinkle over the 
top. 

And my Italian friend looked on dubiously when 
he first saw me preparing to pour a mayonaise over 
lima beans, and afterwards over corn, and green 
peas, and string beans, as if he thought in Italian, 
"To what, base uses may we come, Horatiol" 
"But," I said, "you make the salade de legumes, 
which is — excuse me — something of a vegetable hash; 
these are at least simple and from their looks in- 
viting. And you cut also beets in dice and mix m, 
and they stain the cut potatoes, and the red juice 
mingles with the pale yellow of the mayonaise and 
makes an uneatable color." He put on his study-

ing cap and presently adopted the butter beans 
salad, as well as the others, but he did not give up 
the cut beets in salad cream. Mere matters of fancy 
perhaps — but jet we presently discover which 
things are popular. 



Lima beans, so generally esteemed, in their green 
state have but a very short season. Contrary to the 
general rule, the dried are better than the canned 
beans for winter use. 

698. 

The secret of cooking all dried beans soft is in the 

following : 

Wash and pick them over carefully and put them 
on in plenty of cold water with a rounding teaspoon- 
ful of soda for every two pounds of beans. 

Boil about 2 or 3 hours till they begin to be sofr. 
Then pour them suddenly ^into a colander to drain, 
turn them back in the boiler and put in enough 
fresh cold water to cover them. 

Set them to boil again — in half an hour more they 
will be thoroughly cooked. The sudden adding of 
cold water to the hot beans causes the skin to crack, 
after which they finish cooking easily. There is no 
excuse for the stupidity of the mule-driving cooks 
told of in Scribner's Monthly (Hocky Mountain 
Cookery,) who carry the beans partly cooked in 
their kettles and recook them for three successive 
days in the vain attempt to make them soft. Our 
lima beans are comparatively easy, but the most 
refractory sample of navy beans can be reduced in 
five hours by the above method even at an elevation 
of 11,000 feet. 



699. 



Oaulifiower Salad. 



4 to 6 pounds of cauliflower. 

The hollandaise salad cream of the preceding re- 
ceipt. 

A little oil and vinegar. 

Cut the branches of the cauliflower in the right 
sized pieces for individual dishes while raw, trim 
the stems off evenly, let stand in a pan of cold 
water an hour or two. Set it on with plenty of cold 
water to cover it, to boil, and add salt, but nothing 
else. Cook till the thick stems will leave the fork 
as in boiling potatoes — an hour or less. Drain 
without breaking the pieces and set away to get cold 
. Mix a little oil and vinegar with the cauliflower as 
well as may be by careful pouiing from one bowl to 
another. Over each piece placed on individual 
dishes pour a spoonful of the salad creiim, which 
should be thick enough to mask it and not run off in 
the dish. 

Cau'ifl iwer salad is worth decorating. A few 
capers, French green peas shaken about in vinegar, 
some small patterns stamped out of beet slices, or a 
sprig of parsley. 



For luncheon or a party dinner build up the cau- 
liflower in pyramidal form, or like half a melon, wiih 
fork and knife, laying the pieces in order around 
the dish, the largest at the bottom, heads outward, 
and another tier on top of that, the salad cream to 
be poured over all, and decorate according to your 
taste. 

TOO. Sugar Corn Salad. 



Like the Lima beans salad, and to be dished up 
with the salad cream as a sauce, in vegetable dishes. 
The grains of corn are required to be distinct and 
clean and free from mush, and should be washed in 
a colander for the purpose. 



Before going on to describe the other available 
everyday salad dressings let us include one more 
variety best dressed with the bright hollandaise. 



YOl. Vegetable Salad—Plain 

Take equal parts of four, five or six kinds of 
cooked vegetables — green peas, string beans, cauli- 
flowers, asparagus heads not too soft cooked, corn, 
Lima beans and potatoes, and a smaller proportion 
of onions — if small green ones so much the better — 
and a few slices of beets for ornament. Cut the po- 
tatoes in small dice, the string beans and onions to 
match, ani pull the cauliflower apart in small ppiigs 

Mix all with a little seasoning of pepper and salt 
and shake them about in the salad cream in a bowl. 

Dishup with cut beets and chopped parsley sprink- 
eled over the lop. 

Cooks who care to follow the analogist will have 
observed that hollandaise salad cream is very like 
the hot hollandaise sauce used so much in the high- 
est style cookery, not only for a fish sauce but 
equally for asparagus, cauliflower, artichoke, pota- 
toes, etc. The difference is only in the proportions 
and in this being used cold. Hollandaise or Dutch 
sauce by the English method is mi'der, the French 
more concentrated and pungent. This dressing an- 
swers the question of what we shall do when we 
have no oil, and the people I have instruted with 
pencillings by the way, have generally taken more 
pleasure in making ii than the other more trouble- 
some varieties. 

Still when we have this and the genuine French 
mayonaise there remains a want of which we are re- 
minded when people looking over a table unsatis- 
factorily furnished with lettuce without boiled eggs 
on top, and over a bill of fare equally incomplete 
send timidly asking the powers that be if they can't 
have a hard-boiled egg or two for their salad. Such 
persons have been known to send written on a bill 
of fare the lines imputed to Sidney Smith : 
"True flavor needs it, and your poet begs 
The pounded yellow of two well- boiled eggs. " 



178 



THE AMEEICAN COOK. 



Well, we are coming to that kind of dressing, but 
having in mind the common aversion to and common 
scarcity of huile d* olives vierge, will offer for the ex- 
periments of the critical in such matters a refine- 
ment upon the foregoing hollandaise. 

702. Salad Cream "Without Oil. 



1 cupful of best butter. 

^ cupful of vinegar — large. 

6 raw yolks. 

1 cupful of thin cream. 

J teaspoonful of sah. 

Cayenne and white pepper, of each as much as 
would lie on a dime. 

Boii the vinrgir and butter together in a deep 
bowl-shiiped saucepan. Beat the yolks light. Pour 
the boiling vinegir and butter to them gradu-illy 
while still beaing, then place the mixture on the 
fire again. It is very liable to burn at the bottom 
and must be beaten rapidly till it begins to thicken. 
Then commence and slowly pour in the cup of milk 
or cream and continue beating till the salad dress- 
ing looks like cream or boiled custard. It must 
not quite boil else it will curdle. Add the salt and 
pepper and beat it in a pan of ice water till cold. 



A porcelain lined saucepan should be used for the 
above. If you cinnot stay with the silad cream till 
fifiihed set the saucepan in a pan of boiling wate/ 
and beat it up frequently as you pass. 



V03. 



Oyster Salad. 



1 quart of fresh oysters. 

1 quart of chopped celery. 

Either the hollandaise or the salad cream of the 
preceding receipt. 

Drain the oysters from their liquor. Cut them in 
halves or quartera. Mix with the chopped celery 
and pour the dressing over. 



Half lettuce and half celery will answer for the 
preceding, or tender white cabbage may be used. 
Oyster salad is in demand. 



'Y04. Canned Cove Oyster Salad. 
May be made like the foregoing, the liquor being ex- 
cluded, at.d also with boiled potatoes cut in dice 
in any other salad dressing. 

Clams cin be used as above in time of need. U?e 
some of the clam liquor to thin the salad dressing 
with, instead of water. 



70S. 



Ham Salad. 



Excellent change from potato salad for hotel sup- 



pers. 

1 quart of boiled potatoes, in dice. 

1 quart of celery and lettuce. 

1 quart of lean boiled ham, minced. 

1 tablespoonful of made mustard, 

1 do celery extract. 

The Jiollandaise or any of the foregoing salad 
creams. 

Use the shank meat of boiled ham; chop it fine in 
a wooden bowl. Cut the vegetables neatly in dice 
of uniform appearance. Mix well with the dress- 
ing. 



Now what can we careful managers of provisions 
best do with a whole panful of nice white celery (in 
ice water) when all the heart pieces have already 
been picked out and eaten with salt only ? There 
are but two or three ways of cooking celery, and 
very little suffices for that. 



700. 



Celery Salad. 



"Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And scarce suspected animate the whole." 
2 quarts of celery cut in small dice. 
The cream salad dressing of the last receipt. 
An onion grated or finely minced. 
Little salt. 

Mix well. Serve very cold with a little parsley 
sprinkled over the top. Best for lunch when there 
is cold chicken beside, or other cold meat. 



HARICOTS VEBTS EN MAYONAISE, 

In other words string beans salad, appears in a 
menu of a dinner of the royal family of Spain, one 
that has been preserved as a model, among many 
others. 



Whenever canned vegetables have to be used — ^and 
some of the best brands do very very well for salads 
— drain the liquor from them and rinse them in 
fresh hot water before using. 

"But where are those hard-boiled eggs?" 
*«Coming up!" 

"In dressing salad, mind this law! 

With two hard yolks use one that's raw.*' 



701. 

American Favorite Salad Dressinsr. 

6 hard-boiled eggs (the yolks only needed). 

2 or 3 raw yolks* 

J cupful of olive oil. 

^ cupful of melted fresh butter. 

1 cupful of vinegar. 

2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of made mustard. 
Little black pepper and cayenne. 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



179 



Pound the hard-boiled yolis quite smooth in a 
bowl with the WArm butter, add the silt, mustard 
and peppBr, and then beat in the oil gradually, and 
alternately with tlie vinegar. The bowl should be 
Bet in ice water in warm weather. This makes a 
buttery compound, that may be reduced either wi'h 
eold chicken liquor, cream, or vinegar and water, 
according to the requirement. 



T08. 



Best Potato Salad. 



Favorite hotel supper dish. 
2 quarts of boiled potatoes. 

1 sm til onion. 

2 tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley. 

The popular salad dressing of the preceding re- 
ceipt. 

Slice or break the potatoes, mince the onion ex- 
tremely small, mix, pour the dreesiog over and 
combine thoroughly by turning the ealad from one 
bowl to another three or four timej. Throw the 
fresh chopped parsley into it just before serving. 
The whites of the eggs may be added, cut in strips. 



The foregoing is the formula, the rut to run in, 
but how shall we infuse life into it or explain the 
particular knack which makes one person' s^ potato 
salad 80 utterly unlike and superior to another's ? 
Cold potatoes which have remained in the dinner 
steamers three hours, then are peeled and sliced, 
may do — the dressing will carry the burden of their 
inferiority, but they are not best. 

Tal^e new potatoes if you can, if not, good 
mealy old ones, pare and^ divide in large pieces. 
Throw them in cold salted water and boil about half 
an hour, or till j ust done. Drain the water from 
them and break the largest pieces apart with a 
twist of a fork. When nearly cold mix the dressing 
with the potatoes and set the bowl on ice till wanted* 



We obtain the best salads with the least fuss 
when we can get those trifling cooks, two or more 
of them, to run a rivalry with each other who can 
make the best. The last described dressing is a 
little tedioup, being a double compound of cooked 
and raw. The person dishing up vegetables during 
the slow latter end of dinner generally can prepare 
it between times to be ready for the next meal. 

All these salad dressings are susceptible of im- 
provement by added flavorings, and the epicure 
gets in his extra harmonies in that way. Not to 
confuse rur dirpctions we will treat of the flavoring 
complications by themselvrs in a special chapter. 

A scarcity of eggs often makes us employ a salad 
dressing tl at can be made without any, for hotel 
mea's go on incessantly, but another reason for the 



following being kept in mind is its wh'teness to 
contrast with the preceding kinds, which are all 
yellow. 

710. AUemande Salad Dressinff* 



^ cupful of best butter. 

1 lablespoonful of flour. 

^ cupful of olive oil. 

^ cupful of vinegar. 

1 cupful of strong chicken or veal broth. 

Salt and white pepper. 

Little cream to thin and whiten the dressing. 

Mix the butter and flour together in a saucepan 
over the fire as if making drawn butter, pour in the 
oil and then the broth gradually, stirring till it 
thickens, and then the vinegar, salt and pepper, and 
lastly the cream. 

Strain and set on ice till wanted. 

The bro;h should be strong enough to set in jelly 
when cold, and should be strained through a napkin 
before it is used for the dressing. 



711. Potato Salad a rAUemande. 



2 quarts of potatoes cut in dice* 

3 or 4 green onions, with part of the tops. 
8 or 4 radishes. 

1 head of lettuce cut small. 

The allemande dressing of the preceding receipt. 

Mix all the vegetables and pour the dressing over, 
or reserve the radishes to ornament the tops of the 
dishes, or else use cress or parsley for that purpose. 



The same dressing will serve for various other 
vegetable salads as well as the above, and for fish 
and chicken when there is a mayonaise for border 
and this for top^^dressing. 

'Rubbing the Dish with Gaelic. 

There are yarns and yarns about great secrets in 
c )okery andj their ^ possessors,! like one in the 
Kepobteb recently of a castaway Frenchman who 
made the fortune of a Russian innkeeper and of the 
town by imparting the secret of French chicken 
fiicassee. What a curious scrap-book might be 
made if some of the people who have time.to play 
would collect these wonderful gastronomical and 
culinary anecdotes I 

The really good cooks of the country practice 
thousands of the fine touches which the uninitiated 
might term great secrets, and throw them all into 
the grand aggregate that is styled excellence of the 
hotel cuisine. Some of these fine touches lie in 
flavoring salads, more particularly the salad dress« 
ings, and one of them is to rub the salad dish with 
garlic. There was a head waiter in Boston once 



180 



THB AMEBICAN COOK. 



who nibbed the dish with garlic and his Balads were 
in great repute, though none could teli the sscret of 
the subtle aroma they possessed. If any looked for 
Tulgar garlic in the salad they found none. It was 
only a case of the scent of the roses that huog round 
it still. Sort of hook baitirg trick, an illusion, as it 
were. Pos&ibly some castaway Frenchman had im- 
parted this secret to this head waiter of the Boston 
hotel, but it was impossible for it to remain un- 
shared, and so a waiter, after a while, discovered 
his superior rubbing the dish with garlic. Now two 
persons possessed the secret and of covr^e they 
could not both live in one house. There used to be 
an awful story told about the great Captain Cook 
and his too smart cabin boy who, when at the anti- 
podes, was asked by the gleeful captain if be knew 
where he was, and had the indiscretion to answer 
"under London bridge." But the captain would 
not allow anyone to remain in the vessel who knew 
as much as he did himself, and pitched the poor boy 
overboard, which was very shocking, and that is 
about what happened to this poorjwailer, so he went 
West. 

T13. 

Francatelli instructing the English cooks in French 

cookery could not quite abandon garlic, but found 
it necessary to warn them not to use a head of gar- 
lic, but only one clove, and took occasion to remark, 
"Over-seasoning is the bane of English cookery." 

A little touch of garlic is desirable, it is the petit 
point <r ail in a. ragout praised by Sir Walter Scott. 
And this is but one of many flavorings to be used 
with discretion, for which no directions can be giv- 
en. The foregoing will perhaps give point to the 
following excerpt from Brillat-Savarin, so far as to 
call attention to the flavorings named : 

" I prefer] to tell the story of a Frenchman of 
Limousin, who made his fortune in London by his 
skill in mixing a salad. Although his means were 
very limited, Albignac (so he was c lied, if I re- 
member right) went one day to dine in one of the 
most famous taverns in London. Whilst he was 
finishing his succulent beefsteak, there were five or 
six young dandies of good family regaling them- 
selves at a neighboring table. One of them came to 
him and sa"d very politely: 'Sir, it is said that 
your nation excels in the art of making salads; will 
you be so good as oblige us by mixing one?' 

"D'Albignac consenting, after a little hesitation, 
ordered all that he thought necessary for the expect- 
ed masterpiece, used his best endeavors, "and had 
the good luck to succeed. 

"Whilst studying the ingredients, he answered 
frankly all questions about himself. He said he 
was an emigrant and admitted, not without some 
natural shame, that he was receiving ass'stance 
from the English government — a circumstance 
which no doubt authorized one of the young men to 
slip into the exile's hand a five-pound note, and in- 



sist on his keeping it. 

'•He had given his address, and some time after, 
he received a very civil note, requesting him to go 
and mix a salad in one of the finest houses in Gros- 
venor Square. D'Albignac arrived punctually, 
after furnishing himself with some special season, 
ings and maturing his plans. He had the good luck 
to succeed again. 

"The first party for whom he had manipulated 
had exaggerated the merits of his salad, and the 
second company made so much more noise about it, 
that d'Albignac's reputationwas already made. He 
was known as the fashionable salad maker, and soon 
had a gig, in order to keep his appointments, with a 
servant to bring his mahogany case containing all 
the ingredients — such as vinegars of diflferent fla- 
vors, oils with or without a fruity taste, soy, 
caviare, truffles, anchovies, ketchups, gravies, and 
even hard-boiled eggs. 

"Later he got cases made to order, furnished 
them completely and sold them by hundreds. In 
short he came to realize a fortune of more than 
eighty thousand francs." 



^14. 

In those countries where butter is held in little 

esteem and olive oil in a large degree takes its 
place, it may naturally be surmised the fastidious 
people are as particular in the quality of oil and its 
combinations and critical of their flavors as Ameri- 
cans and English of '-Cold Spring Creamery Gilt 
Edged" and the famous "Suff'olk Dairy Butter." 
The impossibility of improving the flavor of butter 
by any addition does not exist in regard to oil, and 
it seems quite possible for connoiseurs to surprise 
the palate of their friends by new admixtures, 
especially in mayonaise and salads. In Kussia, it is 
said, the oil of sunflower seed is largely used for 
salad making. The olive oil which now comes from 
California has much the same nutty flavor, or per- 
haps more resembles the taste of beech nuts. The 
best we can ask for is to have oil as nearly tasteless 
as possible if we want to make salads more popular, 
and above all reject the oil which is sold cheap 
because it has become rancid, just as we reject strong 
butter. 

If we cannot afford to select our oils of various 
brands — "wither without a fruity taste" — accord- 
ing to the use intended, we need not be so restrict- 
ed in the choice of vinegars of various flavors, to 
give variety to the miyonaise. 

French cooks who disagree in most things are all 
agreed in using tarragon vinegar for salad dressings 
whenever it can-be had and look with a withering 
sort of pity on the American cook who has never had 
even a pint of it bought for his use in the whole 
course of his life. They don't know how thankful 
he is if even the plain vinegar furnished proves not 
to be diluted sulphuric acid. 

Tarragon and other flavored vinegars which con- 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



181 



noiseurs regard as indispensible can be bought like 
any other good thing ready prepared, but where it 
cannot be had for the asking it may be worth while 
for the cook to make his own. 



715. 



Tarragon Vinegar. 



Green tarragon is a herb and can be bought of the 
market gardeners in large cities. It is said to be 
best and strongest just as the plant is going into 
blossom. 

1 pound of tarragon leaves. 

4 quarts of white wine vinegar. 

Let steep in a stone jar two weeks. 

Then filter it through a flannel jelly bag, add to it 
a quarter ounce of isinglass (gelatine will do) dis- 
solved in warm cider or vinegar, to clarify it, bottle 
it and let it stand a month, when it is to be decanted 
into small bottles to keep. 

But hotel cooks can never do all that, whicli is a 
foreign method for phlegmatic people. Reader, did 
you ever go into the bar- room of a back country 
hotel — say in Missouri — though Peck's Sun says 
Iowa — and see on the back shelf a series of home 
made extracts, jars of whiskey with something in it? 
One of these is tansy — green tansy leaves put in to 
flavor the liquor. That is for tansy bitters. An- 
other has peaches. That is for peach and sugar. 
Others have cherries, lemon peel, orange peel. They 
are for we know not what. But tarragon can be 
steeped in cold vinegar like tansy in whisky, and 
half a pint of flavored vinegar thus be had at any 
time. Use it sparingly in piace of part of the plain 
vinegar in any of the salad dressings, not flavoring 
strongly, however, as tarragon is a stranger to most 
of our people. 



Tarragon Vinegar. 

1 pound of green tarragon, partly dried before 
using. 

6 small onions. 

1 ounce of long pepper. 

3 quarts of white wine or cider vinegar. 

Put the whole in a stone jug, cork and let steep 
several weeks. Strain through a napkin or silk seive 
before using. 



TIG. 



Chili Vinegar. 



Common pepper sauce. Dilute a bottle with two 
quarts of vinegar for salad seasoning. A table- 
spoonful is enough to mix in a salad. 



Til. 



Celery Vinegar. 



2 pounds of the solid celery roots and stalks that 
you cannot use on the table — all white, however, 



and sweet. 

2 quarts of vinegar. 

Mince the celery small. Boil the vinegar and pour 
it to the celery in a stone jar. Add a tablespoonful 
of salt, stir up, let steep till next day then strain 
into a demijohn or stone jug and cork it tight. 
This may be used in almost all salads in place of part 
of the plain vinegar. 



Eight ounces of celery seed scalded with a quart 
of boiling vinegar and let stand to steep makes the 
same kind of flavored vinegar as the foregoing. 



But celery extract ready prepared is cheap enough 
and more convenient than either. 



718. 



Garlio Vinegar. 



4 heads of garlic, sliced. 

1 ounce of red peppers, chopped. 

^ teacupful of walnut ketchup. 

1 tablespoonful of salt. 

2 quarts of vinegar. 

Put all in a stone jar, cold, and keep covered 
Used for Russian, Italian, Polish and Spanish 
salads. With the pulp of a few pounded anchovies 
added, and a little red coloring the above is the 
sauce called carachi. 



719. 



Caper Vinegar. 



Turn a bottle of French capers and their vinegar 
into a quart of white wine vinegar in a jug. Strain 
before using. This is best for the Allemande dress- 
ing. 



730. Nasturtium Vinegar. 



Vinegar flavored with pickled nasturtium seeds, 
same as capers. The seeds are also very useful for 
mixing in and decorating salads. 



HZt. 



Beet Vinegar. 



Used occasionally for coloring, is the vinegar in 
which sliced beets have lain, boiled down to about 
one half, to make it stronger and to make it keep 
without spoiling. 



Strawberry, mulberry, raspberry and other vine- 
gars of fruit not sweetened, are made by steeping 
the fruit in vinegar and boiling down, as above, then 
bottling. 

The vinegar from walnut pickles, also vine<;;ar 
made pungent with grated horseradish are also u?ed 
for salad seasoning, but not in ordinary life. T*?ey 
are mentioned for information rather than user 



182 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



VI3;3* Compound Vinegar.

4 ounces of mustard seeds. 
6 cloves of garlic. 
6 small onions.

2 ounces of long pepper. 
^ ounce of cloves. 

4 quarts of white wine vinegar. 
Put all together to steep in a two-gallon jug cork- 
ed tight and let stand several weeks before using. 



With such compounds as the above and others 
doubtless more fanciful than useful we may suppose 
d'Albignac of Limousin filled the vials which he sold 
by the case to the fashionable salad-crazed London- 
ers of sixty years since. 



Y23. Perpetual Hotel Salad. 



Although some cf the things just examined into 
may be out of the regular routine, and occasion an 
impatient Bhrug, let us not pass them without some 
consideration, or rather let us go to the extreme 
contrast of the perpetual salad that we sreused to. 
Perpetual salad has no dressing and wants no flavor- 
ing nor aromatic vinegars — only vinegar, pepper 
and salt. And — oh, yes, onions — lots of onions — 
we had neaily forgot. It is said Americans are 
ecarcely more salsd-loving than the English, and 
some have never tasted salad, yet who does not 
know this one — the perpetual salad made by the 
frugal cook ? It is always made after dinner. Into 
a deep tin pan — in nice places it may be a bowl — 
goes all the boiled potatoes that have been left over, 
and then an onion sliced. Then there will be some 
beets, beans, peas, butter beans, perhaps corn, then 
some onions, pepper, salt, vinegar, and it may be 
some fried bacon and the fat poured over, and this 
salad has been known to have diluted cooked toma- 
toes mixed in. Some ft ugal cooks will make dis- 
tinctions — will have prejudices. One draws the line 
at corn, and appeals to authority: "Who ever heard 
of corn being put in salad ?" Another will set his 
^e against peas, and so on, but at any rate there 
will be potatoes and onions left, and beets, pepper, 
■alt and vinegar. No oil. It would be easy to make 
fun of this, but wherefore ? It is all right, only too 
crude, too perpetual. It is always for supper, and 
is at least better than none. It is so good it ought 
to be made still better and more various. 

With the potatoes cut in dice all of a size, the 
string beans cut in lengths diamond-shaped of size 
to match, the green peas washed from their sauce in 
warm water, the corn likewise, the onions greatly 
reduced in quantity and also cut to match; with a 
little green stuff such as cress or parsley, or a very 
little green onion tops, or celery, sprinkled in, and 



with carrots, pickles and capers, as well as beets, 
cut to correspond and mixed in only at the last 
minute, this salad will be fine, and need not be al- 
ways alike. With any one of the easy salad dress- 
ings already directed to be made poured over and 
shaken about in it the salad will be stylish, 
attractive, enjoyable. Or, without a dressing of 
the made kind, with a little oil added and some 
chopped eggs this combination of ma'eriais that 
costs next to nothing will be equal to some of the 
best salads of the best cooks, with high-sounding 
names. 

We will go on and instance various foreign mix- 
tures of the same class, first taking a lessen from 
one of the noted French cooks — Jules Goufie— and 
as it is not an exact receipt to be proven but rather 
a general lesson in salad making we copy the follow- 
ing as we find it. He says : 

TS^. MACEDOINE SALAD. 

"The following incident first led me to prepare this 
salad: Whilst staying at a friend's country house, 
the mistress of the house came ;_to me in great dis- 
tress, and confided to me that her supplies having 
failed, she was quite at a loss how to entertain her 
numerous guests, and asked me to assist her. 
When I investigated the state of the larder, I found 
there nothing but cold meat and poultry, and cold 
game; all these I took, and, after carefully paring 
and cutting them up, I made them into a huge salad 
which I mixed with an abundant and highly sea- 
soned Mayonnaise sauce, adding lettuce, olive?, an- 
chovies, hard boiled eggs, pickles, and some 
chopped tarragon, chervil and shalots. This salad, 
preceded by a good soup, and followed by sweets 
and fruit, was highly appreciated by the hungry 
guests." 



With all the materials mentioned it cannot be said 
the cupboard was very bare anyway, and the salad 
was neither cheap nor simple, nor hard to imitate; 
but does not the proceeding show the difference in 
national customs? An American would never have 
thought of making a salad, nor would the American 
hostess have felt comfortable seeing all the provisions 
going into that sort of compound. Some of us in- 
stead would likely have made a bill of fare of about 
120 dishes out of the material used to make the din- 
ner described. 

A macedoine salad, like a macedoine of vegeta- 
bles, or of fruits, or macedoine jelly, is a mixture of 
any number of different kinds and colors all cut to 
one size. Goufife says his abundant mayonaise was 
highly seasoned. Elsewhere he says mayonaise 
should be highly flavored. Some salads contain 
very high flavored ingredients and a small quantity 
suflfices, as pome reject them altogether. Mayonaise 
may contain a large amount of mustard, used in 
place of part of the raw eggs. Salads may have the

Hamburg Salad. 



2 large boiled potatoes cut in dice. 
1 cupful of celery, same way. 
^ cupful each of smoked halibut, dried beef and 
red smoked tongue all cut small. 

1 small onion. 

2 cloves of garlic finely minced. 

1 or 2 red peppers out of the pickle jar, 

6 hard-boiled eggs. 

The dried beef and tongue should be first cooked 
by boiling several hours. The celery is better if 
blanched (parboiled.) Mix all, except the eggs, in 
a bowl and shake about with oil poured in till the 
mixture looks rich and glossy, then add a cupful of 
vinegar. Ornament with the yolks of eggs chopped 
fine and the whites cut in strips. 

A German Salad— Herring Salad. 



1 or 2 large smoked herrings. 

1 cupful of pickled red cabbage, chopped small. 

1 cupful of slices of salsify or oyster plant- 
cooked. 

1 cupful of chopped white cabbage. 

Pepper, salt, oil, vinegar. 

Free the meat of the herrings from bones and skin 
and mince it as nearly in dice shape as may be. 
The salsify may be substituted with potatoes if 
necessary, cut in dice or lozenge shapes. Mix all 
wi' h oil, vinegar, pepper and salt.

While ^re are yet exploring for strong and pungent 

ingredients with which perhaps some knowing one 
m'gbt "unwonted richness to the salad give," it 
msy be noticed that the repertory of the salad-mak- 
ing D'Albignac of Limousin included both caviare 
and truffles. People who enjoy anchovy toast; 
which is toast spread with anchovy paste or anchovy 
but!er, or canapes auz anchois; pieces of toast with 
filleted anchovies, will doubtless like canapes au 
caviare. These are all good ealad accompaniments, 
and as anchovies are commonly used in salads there 
is no good reason why caviare might not, but^it is 
more likely it was used only in the way of decora- 
tion. As to what caviare is — and it used to be 
termed Russian caviare as if it had been of Russian 
invention — the Scientific American gives this infor- 
mation : 

**FIyde Park, some eighty-three miles up the 
Hudson River from New York, is one of the prin- 
cipal fishing stations for sturgeon, whose roe, when 
properly prepared, is known as caviare, a food 
preparation greatly enjoyed by our German and 
French ciizens, not to forget the Russians, to whom 



we export large quantities every year. The roe 
weighs about one third as much as the fish, A fifty 
pound roe is considered a large roe. thirty pounds 
being the average. As soon as the sturgeons reach 
shore they are opened and the roes taken out. 
Masses of roe are rubbed through wire selves. The 
eggs are then salted for a short time, after which 
they are laid on hair selves to drain oflF. When 
thoroughly drained what was but a short time ago 
only halibut spawn, is now the toothsome caviare of 
which thousands of pounds are annually spread on 
bread and eaten with much relish." 

Caviare, like every other eatable thing, can now 
be bought in cans. It is black nearly as truffles. 
Softened with a little warm butler it can be used 
with good effect to ornament dishes of fish galads in 
piping and leaf patterns. In the times when fash- 
ionable ladies used to decorate their faces with huge 
patches of fancy patterns stamped out of court 
plaster, and white and yellow dishes on the table 
had the same done for them with trrffle slices, it is 
very likely a similar service was required for fish 
en mayonaise, of the high-flavored caviare. 

7S8, Salads and Bills of Pare. 

There will be a question, now that we are to de- 
scribe the more formal dinner salads, as to their 
proper place ia the bill of fare, and it would be ex- 
tremely convenient if the bills in use the world over 
would kindly keep themselves according to a few 
definite patterns as, say, French, Russian, English 
and American. In fact, however, among fifty model 
menus of European court dinners there are scarcely 
two alike in their arrangement of dishes and head- 
ings, and the promiscuous bills of fare of American 
hotels do not vary more in their minor features than 
those of the palaces of the European nations. The 
slight differences betwixt salads and the cold 
hors-d'oeuvre often make it appear as if salads ap- 
peared in two places on the same bill. The follow- 
ing examples will, however, show the general usages 
in this respect. The first menu, chosen for its 
brevity, contains the intermediate frozen punch 
which has come to be regarded the distinguishing 
feature of the thorough French menu, although in 
the collection before us it appears so rarely as to 
seem more the exception than the rule.

It would be a relief to anyone after scanning three 
score and ten such menus as the foregoing and find- 
ing the salads wandering up and down in the bills 
and going to and fro in the midst of them, to be able 
to give them a local habitation and a place all their 
own, as happily we do in our American hotel bill 
of fare, the form that is unborrowed, that contains 
some features of all the precediog specimens, yet is 
different from all, and more suitable to the habits 
and customs of the people. Some of the most re 
nowned hotels of the United States use the exact 
form following, and a very large number beside 
only make the one or two changes of placing ttie list 
of boiled meats above instead of beside the roasts, 
and substituting the line "cold dishes and salads" 
for mayonaise, dispensing with the cold meats head.

The last named salad is found in the menu of a 
German duke's grand dinner. "In Holland and 
Belgium, white chicory is sold at a cheap rate early 
in the spring, and supplies a grateful salad long be- 
fore lettuces are to be had." Endive and succory 
are other names for chicory. 



The definite object in view in bringing in the 
foregoing perhaps somewhat formidable looking 
mass of French is to discover what the best Euro- 
pean bill of fare composers and cooks do when they 
do their highest endeavors for the greatest occasions 
that can arise in their particular world, and not at 
all to lead any callow geese on this side to copy and 
use the imposing words they do not understand. 
We must have a standard to judge American hotel 
work by, and as far as names and words can go to 
give an idea, these imperial menus and the salad 
dishes culled from many others mark the topmost 
notch. There are some American hotels, their 
menu writers, caterers and cooks, who would not 
consent to be ranked below the European in any- 
thing, even in salads. However, there can be no 
dispute, for after we have learned what they make 
there remains the greater question of perfection of 
work, skill, readiness, dexterity, and good taste, 
and that will always remain open. Salads made 
only to look at are out of place in a hotel. Orna- 
mentation that consumes hours of time is impracti- 
cable where a new banquet comes on every day. In- 
stead of one great dish of salad we have a hundred 
or two little dishes. Every person at table if he 
chooses has a complete dish to himself. Whatever 
fixing up is to be done must be done quickly or it 
will not be done at all. 

A great check might be put upon the vulgar use 
of spurious French in bills of fare if guests and em- 
ployers were to grow inquisitive and quizzical, de- 
manding to know what each word means, of who- 
ever wrote it. There's a nice new game for winter 
time.

the addition of a spoonful of fine bread crumbs, mix 
all with a little oil, vinegar and mu^^tard. Wash 
and dry the shells and serve the meat in thfm 
placed on a bed uf something green — lettuce, cress, 
young celery plants or parsley. 



729 a. Potato Salad Plain. 

1 pint bowl of cooked and sliced potatoes. 
1 small onion, sl'ce J or chopped. 
J cupful of vinegar. Parsley, salt, pepper. 
1 tablespoonful of salad oil, or of fried bacon fat. 
Mix all together by pouring from one bowl to an- 
other and shaking up. 

Hotel Dinner Salads. 



"Insipid? Gastronomic heresy ! There is nothing 
better than the potato. I eat them done in all the 
diflFerent ways, and should they appear in the 
second course, whether a la lyonaise or au souffle, I 
hereby enter a protest for the preservation of my 
rights." — Savarin. (Mem. To send them in also en 
salade.) 

A thorough first class cook of a first class hotel 
would not like to send to the dinner table the in- 
formal salads of the preceding part, which, however, 
do very well for ordinary supper and lunch, besides 
serving as examples for the employment of the half 
dozen salad dressings already described. 



730. Parisian Potato Salad. 



POMMES PABISIENNE EN MAYONAISE. 

Parisian potatoes are so called when scooped out 
of large potatoes with a scoop which forms them in 
balls of the size and appearance of white cherries, or 
a little larger or smaller, for the scoops are sold of 
different sizes. 



1. Make the mayonaise sauce in the quick way 
with bowl and egg-beater, directed in the beginiung 
of this book, and add a tablespoonful of made mus- 
tard and a very little cayenne. 

Scoop out about two quarts of Parisienne potatoes, 
set them on to boil in cold mik and water with a 
little salt in it, and take them off when just done, 
before they break out of shape. Drain in a colander 
and set away to get cold. 

Also scoop out about a cupful of cooked blood 
beets, to match ihe potatoes, and cover the beet balls 
with vinegar. 

Just before dinner set out from 15 to 25 small flat 
dishes (for the probable orders of 50 persons with a 
varied bill to choose from). Place a spoonful of 
mayonaise in a pan or bowl and shake the potatoes ] 



about in it to co'^i them. Pile 8 or 9 in each dish, 
draw a spoonful of m-yonaise over so as to mask 
them, and finish by placing with two forks 3 or 4 of 
the beet balls around for ornament. 



2. Large dishes can be put up in the same gen- 
eral way, the beets may then be placed in a row or 
two diagonally across the top, as well, and some 
parsley added, giving the effect of a wreath of ber- 



3. It is worth while to know that when the po- 
tatoes are of a mealy sort that break in the water 
they are better simmered till done in frei-h butter, 
first melted and poured off the salt sediment, but 
not made fryi -g hot. The potatoes are not to be 
allowed to become in the least brown, nor even to 
have a hard skin fried on them; only gently stewed 
in butter. The butter can afterwards be used for 
frying, etc. 

4. Instead of repeating, the next time use the 
allemande salad dressing, which, if made with ua- 
colored butter, is pearl white, and ornameiit with 
parsley, and a few capers on top, or pickled nastur- 
tium seeds or pods, or some pickled red cabbage 
chopped and drained from its vinegar, the beets in 
this case being left out. 

T31. Beet and Potato Salad. 



Cut some cooked blood beets with ycur sabalier 
scollop knife into cubes or dice shapes with flu'.ed 
sides, and keep the cut shapes in vinegar. 

Prepare some Parisienne potatoes — there thould 
be about a quart of each— and the allemande salad 
dressing. Pile a few of the beet shapes in the mid- 
dle of the dishes, place the potatoes aroucd es a 
border, and with a tablespoon pour the sauce ever 
the potatoes, leaving the beets of their natural color. 
Ornament with a hasty sprig of parsley to each 
dish. 



"Characterless people who are like sa'sify that is 
always just going to taste like an oyster and never 
does." — Talmage. 

("Was ofien thought but ne'er so well expressed." 
Mem. To give salsify a chance in allemande dress- 



T33. 



Salsify Salad. 



SALSIFIS EN MAYONAISE. 

Wash the salsify roo's and shave off the outsid?, 
throw them in cold water with salt in it and set 
them on to boil. Try with a fork to know when 
done. Salsify requires an hour or more to cook. 
After draining from the hot water put it immediae- 
ly in a pan of cold to keep it of good color. 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



189 



1. Cut (he Falsify across in round lozenge shapes 
as nearly rf one size as prsssible. Put it in a bowl 
and pour over it the allemaudo salad dressing with 
a little Chili vinegar mixed in. 

Salsify is best in the spring of the year, aficr it 
has ha I the winter frosts, and garden cress can then 
be had for garnish. Make a border of cress on the 
small flat dish or saucer and p!ace a spoonful of the 
8 ilsify and its dressing in the middle. 



2. Cut the salsify i i lengths of about 2 inches, 
not using the largest roots for this purpose. Place 
3 or 4 cf the pieces on each dish, diagonally across 
the dish, and pour over the pile a spoonful of thick 
mayonaise. It is better if the pieces of salsify can 
steep in oil and vinegar, enough to moisten them, 
awhile before dinner. 



The cream hollandaise, or the other dressings, can 
of course be used instead of the two preceding, and 
salsify does well to mix in salads with other vegeta- 
bles. 



The mak'ng of the allemande dressin is not so 
simple but that it may be easily spoiled if the oil 
and cream be added too hastily. Probably a half 
cup more cf cream will be needed than the re- 
ceipt calls for, and it should not be ice cold nor 
added faster than a spoonful at a time. This 
dressing is valuable for needing no eggs and but 
little oil, and is suitable for all sorts of vegetables. 



"We Florentines mostly use names as wo do 
prawns, and strip them of all flourishes before we 
trust them to our throats." — Romola. 

The prawn is a larger kind of shrimp and for 
the cook's purposes is the same thing. It has 
longer horns, feelers or flourishes than the shrimp, 
which causes it to be preftrred for a buisson; it is of 
lighter color when coaked, and in the markets 
usually sells for a lower price than the shrimp.

Shrimp Salad. 



MAYONAISE OF SHRIMPS OR PRAWNS, OR SHRIMPS 
(CREVETTES) EN MAYONAlSE. 

1 Prepare about a quart of shrimps divested cf 
their coat of maii, fails, heads and flourishes, and 
place them in a bowl. 

Make the thin mayonaise or salad cream and pour 
it over the shrimps. 

Take some heads of lettuce from the pan of ice- 
water in which they have lain, shake them free 
from wafer and shred them as fine as possible with 
a sharp knife, on a clean board kept for the pur- 
pose. About enough to fill a 2 quart pan will do. 

Place a li-.tle pile of the lettuce in the email, deep 
dish, ice cream saucer or deep glass plate; mnke a 
hollow in the middle, forming a border of lettuce, 



and in the hollow place a gooi spoonful of the 
shrimps and dressing. Dish up these only as reed- 
ed, for the lettuce soon dries and loses its color. 



2. Make the thick mayonaise, or el^e use that 
termed American Falad dressing, made of about the 
same consis ence. 

Prepare the shrimps, put them in a bowl, pour in 
a basting-spoonful of vinegar, two of oil, a little 
white pepper, and shake about, making the shrimps 
look moist and shining. 

Prepare small white hearts of letfuce, one f r 
each individual dish, pull them apart and lay the 
leaves slantwise, wreath fashion, around the dish. 
Place a neat spoonful of the seasoned shrimps in the 
center and over them pour or spread a spoonful of 
the mayonaise. 



3. For a large dish like the preceding fill the 
shrimps, after seasoning with oil and vinegar, into 
a melon mould (a mould in shape of half a melon), 
and slighly press to give them the shape. Turn 
them out onto a flat dish already prepared with 
leaves of heart lettuce. Pour the mayonaise over 
the shrimps and decorate with eggs, olives, parsley, 
cut shapes of beets, flowers, etc. 

4. Having seasoned ths shrimps shape them for 
individual dishes by pressing a spoonful into a cus- 
tard cup, or egg cup or similar mould. 

Prepare about a quart of celery by chopping it 
fine and seasoning in like manner as the shrimps, 
with oil, vinegar and white pepper, adding a little 
salt also. 

Turn the shrimps on to their dish and place 
a,round a border of the celery with a teaspoon. 
Finish with a spoonful of mayonaise on top of the 
shrimps. Or the mayonaise may be dispensed with, 
or, leave the shrimps without a dressing, and pour 
the allemande dressing from a spoon over the celery 
border. 



6. Place a neat spoonful of shrimps — either sea- 
soned or not, as the time may allow — on the small 
flat dish, and over the top spread a spoonful of may- 
onaise. Throw 3 or 4 capers iu the center, p'ace 2 
or 3 quarters of h ird-boiled egg around, or 3 or 4 
olives, like the beet balls on the potato salad, or uee 
both, and any other ornament such as cress or 
parsley that may be at hand. 



6. Reverse the order of any of the foregoing, 
when the shrimps ere of good shape, and hand- 
somely coiled, by making a pile of shred lettuce or 
chopped celery in the middle and placing the 
shrimps feround a^^d upon it. A very pretty mix- 
ture may be made of shrimps in cress, or water 
cress, without any other dressing.

THE AMERICAN COOK. 



And now we cannot well go further without some 
aspic jelly, and will proceed to make it. 



"What a perfect family!" exclaimed Hugo, as he 
extracted a couple of fat little birds from their bed 
of aspic jelly. "Everything they do in such perfect 
taste. How safe you were here to have ortolans for 
supper! ' ' — Lothair, 



"Garnished with cut carrots, like a made dish in 
Bloomsbury Square." — Pelham. 

"The dinner was a banquet — a choice boquet be- 
fore every guest, turtle and venison and piles of 
whitebait, and pineapples of prodigious size, and 
bunches of grapes that had gained prizes. The 
champagne seemed to flow in fountains, and was 
only interrupted that the guest might quaff Bur- 
gundy or taste Tokay. But what was more de- 
lightfr.l than all was the enjoyment of all present, 
and especially of their host. That is a rare sight- 
Banquets are not rare, nor choice guests, nor gra- 
cious hosts: but when do we ever see a person enjoy 
anything?' ' — Endymion. 



"Pantagruel did not like this pack of rascally 
scoundrels, with their manifold kitchen sacrifices, 
and would have been gone had not Epistemon pre- 
vailed with him to stay and see the end of the farce. 
He then asked the skipper what these gastrolatous 
hobgoblins used to sacrifice to their god Gaster on 
interlarded fish days? 'For his first course,* said 
the skipper, 'they give him caviare, potages, then 
salads a hundred varieties, of cresses, sodden hop- 
tops, spinage, celery, sives, rampions, mushrooms, 
asparagus, woodbind, red herrings, pilchards, an- 
chovies, fry of tunny, pickled eels, cauliflowers, 
beans, salt salmon, prawn?, crayfish, and a world 
of others.*" — French Classic. 



Everybody had an appetite fordinner to-day, and 
the dinner was worthy of the appetites. Zenobia's 
husband declared to himself that he never dined so 
well, though he gave his cAc/£500 a year." — Endy- 



" *And now you think of remaining here?' said 
Mr. Wilton. 

'No,' said the lady, 'that I can ^ ot do. I lo^e 
everything in this country except its climate, and, 
perhaps, its hotels.*" — Endymion. 



"'The odd thing is,' said St. Aldegonde, 'you 
never can get anything to eat in these houses. Their 
infernal cooks spoil everything * " — Lothair, 



" 'No,' said Harold, 'the question is, whether the 
English climate will agree with me. It's deuced 
shifting and damp; and as for the food, it would be 



the finest thing in the world for this country if the 
Southern cooks would change their religion, g^t 
persecuted, and fly to England, as the old silk- 
weavers did.' 'There are plenty of foreign cooks 
for those who are rich enough to pay for them, I 
suppose,' said Mrs. Transome, 'but thf y are un- 
pleasant people to have about one's house ' " — Felix 
Bolt, 

" 'The blonde misses of Aibion see nothing in the 
dull inhabitants of their brumous isle, which can 
compare with the ardor and vivacity of the children 
of the South. We bring our sunshine with us. My 
genius would use itself in the company of these 
rustics — the poesy of my art can not be understood 
by these carnivorous insularies.' " — Monsitur le chef 
Mirobolant. — Pendennis, 



"Then Answered Dingdong: 'I bring these sheep 
out of a country where the very hog?, God be with 
us, live on nothing but myrobolaus.' " — French 
Classic. 



' And so, with a nod, he walked ofi" to the cook's 
shop at the corner of the Vicolo San Nicolo, and 
bought him half a loaf of black bread and a plate 
of beans and oil, upon which frugal fare, washed 
down with another draught from the green pitcher, 
he presently made his solitary meal. His rage was 
over now." — Lord Brackenbury, 



Perhaps a little familiarizing' talk about aspic jelly 
will do more good than the bald receipt for making 
it alone. For, paradoxically enough, aspic jelly is 
the one unnecessary article that we cannot possibly 
do without in the kitchen, not in the kitchen of a 
house that aims to be above the garnish of cut car- 
rots style of Bloomsbury Square. Aspic jelly is one 
of the barriers, greater a good deal than mayonaise, 
which shut ofi" the European style, or, more strictly 
speaking, French cookery from the popular appre- 
ciation and adoption. You have opened a hotel. 
You are going to be first class. Oh, yes. You get a 
foreign cook, but instead of the decided improve- 
ment in the get-up of common articles which you 
looked for, unless he be a very reasonable man and 
quick to perceive your wishes you will find him, 
most likely, engaged in the preparation of some un- 
intelligible nonsensicalit'es that were not included 
in your plans at all. He thinks you must have your 
dishes garnished, ornamented, and he is not the 
one to give you a garnish of cut carrots or turnips. 
He will place around your dishes "bold croutons of 
aspic jelly," as his celebrated masters direct. To 
get this he will bother you considerably, ordering 
calves' feet, chickens, pigs' feet, gravy beef, veal 
shanks, gelatine, lemons, eggs, flavorings etc. As 
you are not intending to have calves' feet, etc., on 
the table, perhaps you can't see the use of all these

things and will forget them for a few days, to the 
great distress of the cook. And when they do come 
the zealous fellow who means to set your house on 
the very top pinnacle of first classness may be seen 
working at night after all others are in bed doing 
what seems foolishness — but he is carrying on his 
art. And after that supply is exhausted and a new 
lot of materials called for you may witk ■»n effort 
remember that there was on the table a dish of cold 
birds in a bed of jelly, whicn one or two out of fifcy 
persons — a Lothair, or some such stranger — saw and 
admired. Yon will remember the shapes or the 
border Ox chopped jelly around the dishes that 
sparkled with it as if set in jewelry, and a boned 
turkey entirely coated with transparent jelly, of 
which somebody sitting near said, "How pretty," 
and "Is it good to eat?" And then perhaps you 
have to think over the unsatisfactory condition of 
the roasts and the mashed potatoes and conclude 
that French cookery is one of the things that no 
fellow can understand, while the cook, discouraged, 
may be repeating some of the words of Monsieur 
Alcibiades Mirobolant above quoted. There is a 
want of mutual understanding in these matters. 
The foreign cook knowing that these extra accom- 
p'ishments are what make him different from the 
home-bread article is apt to magnify their import- 
ance out of all reason, and not being used to count 
the cost of labor and material, is almost sure to take 
the longest way round about to reach the desired 
end. Hotel-keepers want French cooks with 
American ways, and American cooks with French 
knowledge. It is French to know how to make and 
how to use aspic jelly. For that reason we cannot 
quite do without making it once a week, and this 
regardless of whether people call for it or not. It 
is well known that it is not necessary to existence. 
Doctor Tanner quite receitly lived forty days and 
forty nights without once tasting aspic jelly; but it 
is a matter of fashion. It has been seen that aspic 
is mentioned often in the loftiest menus, and the 
initiated are cognizant of aspic in many dishes be- 
sides where it is not mentioned by name. Because 
the leaders on the other side choose, followers on 
this side must. The most delicate flattery of their 
table hotel-keepers ever receive, and generally the 
most highly appreciated, is when distinguished 
parties look on admiringly and say, "You employ 
French cooks, don't you?" — though perhaps Pompey 
and Dina "done been done it all themselves." 
However, distinguished parties never say that when 
the French in the bill of fare is Choctaw. Meat 
jelly in the rough is no foreigner, however, but is 
native everywhere. The English name is savory 
jelly, aspic is the same refined. This ought to be 
better understood, that the first consideration should 
be to make and keep the jelly savory, so that the 
meat it goes with is improved by ir — the jelly com- 
bining several fine flavors and the essence of choice 



game, may be even more delicious and more sought 
after by epicures than the meat itself. That is where 
skill and refinement in cookery come in. The great 
raised cold pork and venison pies or pastys, the 
brawn and the boars head on the oaken tables of 
Cedric and Athelstane, the Saxon earles of Ivanhoe, 
were filled and set and solid with aspic jelly in the 
rough. It was the gravy set with its own richness, 
but dark gray and looked as if it wanted straining 
But the earls were invited by the French Prince 
John and his nobles to a feast, and there was a fine 
bird pie, cold, of which the gravy had been clarified. 
The birds were so rare and costly as to be almost 
priceless, and betwixt them the aspic jelly had been 
poured and looked like amber. And even Athelstane 
appreciated the merits of that pie filled with delicate 
aspic, for after he had gobbled the whole business 
he wiped his mouth and asked what that thing was 
that was so good. Now, we don't want to say that 
aspic jelly, taking it all round, is better than rich 
gravy, but It certainly is far more ornamental, and 
while you are making it to serve with fat little reed 
birds or rice birds because it is ornamental, take 
cat e it does not get dosed with unsuitable herbs and 
vegetables, and then stick and burn on the bottom, 
and taste worse than scorched beans. The cook and 
confectioner can take the jelly from the pigs-feet keg 
and bring it back looking as clear as glass, and 
when broken it will shine "like dew on the gowan 
lying," but the demands of refined cookery will not 
be satisfied unless it taste as good as it looks. 

Y34. 

Sometimes there is a remainder of a good looking 
amber clear soup left over that sets in jelly when 
cold, and you say involuntarily to yourself, "how 
rich that was, and what a pity to throw it away." 
Perhaps it need not be. It will make savory jelly 
for something— for pressed corned beef and the like. 
But when there is a surplus of the broth that fowls 
and turkeys have been boiled in you have as good a 
material for aspic as can be made. Understanding 
this and a little rule or two, the terrors of jelly- 
making and the dark mysteries of galantines and 
aspic salads will disappear. 

One and a half ounces of gelatine to a quart of 
water will make jelly, or 

One ounce of gelatine to a quart of good broth, and 
less still, the stronger the broth may be. 

One calf's foot boiled in 3 quarts of water will 
make a quart of jelly without any ge'atine. A pig's 
foot and shank does the same. Fowls either old or 
young boiled tender in the liquor are necessary for 
good quality. Veal and veal shanks and coarse 
beef are also used, but will not do very well alone. 



"Supper time approaching, Don Quixote retired 
to bis apartment, and Sancho inquired of the host 
what they could have to eat. The landlord told 
him his paiate should be suited— for whatever thf

air, earth and sea produced, of birds, beast or fish, 
that inn was abundantly provided with. 'There is 
no need of all that,' quoth Sancho; 'roast us but a 
couple of chickens, and we shall be satisfied; for my 
master hath a delicate stomach, and I am no glut- 
ton/ 

" *As for chickens,* said^the mnkeeper, 'truly we 
have none, for the kites have devoured them/ 
'Then let a pullet be roasted,' said Sancho; 'only see 
that it be tender.' 'A pullet? my father!' answered 
the host; faith and troth, I sent about fifty yester- 
day to the city to be sold; but excepting pullets, ask 
for what you will.' 'Why, then,' quoth Sancho, 
'e'en give us a good joint of veal or kid, for they 
cannot be wanting.' 'Veal or kid?' replied the host, 
*ah, now I remember we have none in the house at 
present, for it is all eaten; but next week there will 
be enough and to spare.' 'We are much the better 
for that,' answered Sancho; 'but I dare say all 
these deficiencies will be made up with plenty of 
eggs and bacon.* ' 'Fore heaven,* answered the 
host, 'my customer is a choice guesser! I told him 
I had neither pullets nor hens, and he expects me 
to have eggsl Talk of other delicacies, but ask no 
more for hens.' 'Bodyofmel" quoth Sancho, 'let 
us come to something — tell me in short what you 
have, Master Host, and let us have done with your 
flourishes.' 'Then,* quoth the inkeeper, 'what I 
really and truly have is a pair of cow-heels, that 
m^y be taken for calves' feet; or a pair of calves' 
/eet that are like cow-heels. They are stewed with 
peas, onions and bacon, and at this very moment 
are crying out, 'come eat mel come eat mel' 'From 
this moment I mark them as my own,' quoth 
Sancho; 'let nobody lay a finger on them. I will 
pay you well, for there is nothing like them — give 
me but cow-heel, and I care not a fig for calves' 
feet.' "—Don Quixote. 



735. 



Aspic Jelly. 



To make savory jelly, take 

12 pounds of meat and feet. ' 

12 quarts of water. 

12 hours to boil them gently. 

12 cloves. 

1 bay leaf. 

1 small turnip. 

1 small onion. 

1 carrot. 

1 rounded tablespoonful of pepper. 

1 do do salt. 

3 to 6 lemons, juice only. 

6 eggs to clarify the jelly. 
As has been already intimated it makes but little 
difference in ordinary life what kind of meat is used. 
For choice we will say 2 calves' feet, 2 pigs' feet 
with the shanks attached, 2 old fowls and some veal 
bones or shin of beef. Chop and break the pieces. 



Put them on in a boiler having a false bottom to 
prevent burning, or, otherwise, put a pie plate in 
before the meat. Fill with cold water. Bring to a 
boil and skim off what rises to the top. Then push 
the boiler to the back part of the range, and let sim- 
mer gently about 12 hours. It should by that time 
be reduced to about a third of the quantity of water 
first put in and will setin jelly when cold. But 
during the time of cooking the vegetables and salt 
and pepper should have been added. White pepper 
is best, whole black pepper, broken a little, is next, 
and if you have not these ground black pepper will 
do. 

Strain off your 4 quarts of jelly and fat, from the 
meat and bones, and set it away to get quite cold. 
Then take off the grease from the top, and wipe off 
the last particles with a cloth dipped in warm water. 
Now melt the jelly in a good sized kettle or br'ght 
tin pan. Squeeze in some lemon juice— enough to 
give it a tart taste. Of the six eggs take 2 entire, 
4 whites, and all the shells, and a cup cf cold water, 
beat them up, add them to the melted jelly and beat 
up to mix. Then boil — about half an hour will be 
right. 

One reason of trouble in making jelly is the white 
of egg does not get cooked enough, but runs like 
milk through the jelly bag and makes the jelly 
cloudy when it should be clear. If it boils over too 
much set the kettle and all in the oven till the white 
of egg has become a gray curd; then k will strain 
clear. 

Another trouble is when you try to do without 
lemons the jelly very often is gummy and will not 
run through flannel, nor hardly through a seive. 
An acid cuts it and makes it limped. If you must 
use vinegar instead of lemon juice, you must. It 
will have the same effect — to make the jelly run 
through. 

The jelly bag is made of red flannel — about a yard 
— a wire ring to hold the top open — the bag running 
down to a point, funnel shaped. Suspend it by 
strings like the bail of a bucket. 

The clarifying process above may of course be 
applied to any soup stock or gelatine liquor, and 
applies with more force to sweetened jellies, 
which are harder to make than aspic. 



The aspic may be cooled on dishes, of right 
depth to stamp out fancy shapes when cold. The 
color will likely be light straw color. A few drops 
of burnt sugar caramel will make it amber and a 
few more brandy or ale color. A few drops of 
red coloring will make pink of the clear and port 
wine color of the brown. ' 



The other way will come more familiarly home 
to hotel cooks where the stock boiler is the al- 
ways ready resource.

•736. Aspic Jelly.— Hotel Method. 

Draw elf 4 quarts of clear soup stock from the 
stock boili r. It has already been lightly eeasoned 
with the common vegetables, and for this use should 
have a head cf celery and a handful of parsley ex- 
tra. Ctiop about 2 pounds of lean beef fine like 
sausage. Mix a pint of cold water with it, then 
put the beef in the 4 quarts of stock and boil it a 
short lime. Strain this consomme from the beef 
through a fine gravy strainer, and set it in the 
refrigerator that the grease may be all taken ofi* 
when cold. 

Then add to it the whiles and shells of 6 eggs, 
juice of 4 lemons, 1 bay leaf, a tablespoonful of 
bruised pepper corns, or some white pepper, <he 
same of salt, a ladleful of cold water beaten in the 
eggs, and 4 ounces of the cheap, white gelatine, 
that floats while dissolving and can't burn. Bring 
the mixture to a boil, with frequent stirring. 
When done pour it 3 or 4 times through the jelly 



Now we have a pail of savory jelly in the ice 
chest always ready, and can go along with the salad- 

makicg. 



73 T. Shrimps in Aspic 

ASPIC OF SHBIMPS OB PRAWNS. 

Good aspic or savory jelly is a really pleasant con- 
diment with fchrimps and the like as well as very 
preity ornament, but someone rem^^rks in a common- 
sense way that it ought to i« fish jelly instead of 
meat jelly. 

1. Pick a quart of shrimps and keep the largest 
and shapliest for this purpose, laying aside the 
broken pieces for fish sauce, etc. Shake up the 
shrimps in oil and vinegar enough to make them 
shine. 

Chop some bright amber-colored jelly. Slice ex- 
tremely fine, or chop — only just before it is to be 
used — some green lettuce, cress and mustard, or 
celery with half green tops, as may be convenient, 
and season with oil, vinegar and salt. 

Put a spoonful of the green salad in each small 
dish and form a border with it. In the middle 
place a spoonful of the chopped jelly well spread 
out, and on that, well in the center, not to hide the 
border of jelly, place a spoonful cf shrimps. Take 
up a little more of the chopped jelly on a silver fork 
and striking dredge it all over the dish. 

2. Melt some jelly and add to it a flavoring of 
pepper sauce. Half ^rd sauce (poured ofiF clear wih- 
out dregs) and one drop of red coloring. 

Spread the shrimps close together and only two 
deep on the large-t sized meat platter, pour enough 
of the jelly over just to cement the shrimps together 
and set the dish in the refrigerator to get cold. 

When to be dished up cut the shrimps in jelly in 
cakes, either with a sharp knife in obloDgs, tri- 



angles, squares, or diamonds, leaving no residue, oi 
with a round or oval cutter. 

Dish up in combination with a green salad bor- 
der. One oblong cake on a bed of cress. Two 
small triangles set up against a pile of salad in the 
middle. 

3. The last is one of the speedy if somewhat 
rough-and-ready ways that are always piacticable, 
while this takes time. 

Prepare a small bowl of chopped green lettuce, 
about a pint may do, and moisten it with some salad 
dressing. 

Pour a spoonful of flavored jelly in each one of 
about 25 slender conical shaped wine glasses, or 
moulds like them, let it run all around to coat the 
sides, stick the shrimps in order upon the jelly, and 
let it set in a cold place. When about two rows 
have been put in place, put a teaspoonful of the 
chopped lettuce in the cavity, and the shrimps 
dipped in jelly, on the point of a fork, can be 
placed in the upper rows easily. Fill up with the 
prepared lettuce and pour a spoonful of jelly on top 
of that and be sure the moulds stand level while the 
jelly is setting. The moulds or glasses have to be 
placed in ice water when the weather is not cold. 

To dish up, dip the mould a moment in warm water, 
wipe the outside and shake the shape of jellied 
shrimps out onto a bed of cress in its dish. Stick a 
plume of fennel or a flower in the top of the cone. 

4. The stamping works now turn out a great 
variety of fancy shapes of gem pans, some in form 
of scallop shells, that are well adapted for moulding 
these individual aspics in, and are less troublesome 
than border moulds. There is no good reason why 
this day's dinner should be just like any other day's 
dinner in these little ornamental accessories. 



738. 



Oyster Salad. 



6 dozen fresh oysters. 

6 heads of celery with part of their green tops. 

About half as much tender white cabbage. 

The mayonaise salad dressing. 

1. Make the mayonaise with lemon juice instead of 
vinegar — or use the juice of 2 lemons, 1 tablespoon- 
ful of tarragon vinegar and a little pepper sauce or 
chili vinegar. 

After washing the celery and cabbage throw then* 
into boiling salted water, let them boil not less than 
5 nor more than 10 minutes, then drain and cover 
with cold water, then drain dry and chop them 
fine. 

The green celery leaves acquire an intenser green 
in the boiling water, and chopped with the stalks 
and roots give a tinge to the whole. 

Drain the liquor from the oysters and bring it to 
a boil in order to remove the scum either by skim- 
ming or straining. After that add to it an equal 
quantityof good vinegar, a seasoning of broken 



194 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



pepper-corns, pepper sauce and salt, then put in the 
oysters and bring them just to the boiling point and no 
more. Siiake the saucepan continually that the 
oysters may become set while cooking in round and 
plump shape. Then drain them from the liquor and 
set them away on a dish to become ice-cold. 

When to be dished season the chopped celery, 
etc., with oil and vinegar, slightly, but well mixed 
in, spread a spoonful of it in the middle of each 
small dish, on that lay some oysters side by side, 
and on top another spoonful of the celery. Flatten 
the top slightly but don't smooth the sides. Pour 
the mayonaise over just thin enou to run. 



The foregoing is not enough for the average orders 
of fifty persons. 



2. Prepare the ingredients as above — but the 
allemande salad dressing or any other may be used 
as well. 

Fry some outside leaves of lettuce, twice as many 
as you expect to use that you may select those 
which are the most like shells in shape and of the 
finest green-bronze color after frying. Good sweet 
lard should be used made hot in the potato fryer, 
but not smoking hot. The leaves take about a 
minute or two to fry green colored but dry. When 
done lay them hollow side down on baking sheets 
and let them drain perfectly in a hot place, then let 
them become cold. Shape little oyster (or lobster) 
salads in egg cups, and dish them up in these crisped 
lettuce leaves like a fish in a shell. Spread dressing 
over as usual. 



739. 



Aspic of Oysters. 



Prepare the oysters as for salad by scalding them 
in seasoned vinegar and oyster liquor. 

Prepare some green aspic jelly {ravigote jelly) by 
boiling some green celery leaves done, draining dry, 
pounding, mixing with clear aspic and then strain- 
ing it again. Cool the green jelly in the smallest 
flat dishes — it is to form foundations to lay the 
oysters on. 

Boil some eggs hard and chop the yolks for border 
ornament. Now place about four oysters diagonally 
side by side in the smallest flat dish, and pour over 
enough clear white or amber jelly, highly eeasoned 
with pepper sauce and lemon juice, to nearly cover 
them. When all are cold slip the shapes of green 
jelly from their dishes by means of a knife and 
place them bottom side up on the dishes they are to 
be served in, then the shape of oysters on that and 
ornament with the minced yolks or tiny leaves of 
heart lettuce.

and a handful of tawny fungi for soup ; a little pat 
of fresh butter wrapped in mulberry leaves; and the 
proffered morsel of stracchino for Uncle S'efano's 
supper." — An Italian Market-place. — Lord Bracken- 
bury. 

"Another species of fennel, called finocchio by the 
Italians, is also u?ed for the same purposes, and a? a

"In a corner, far away from any group of talk- 
ers, two mules were standing, well adorned with 
red tassels and collars. One of them carried wooden 
milk-vessels, the other a pair of panniers filled with 
herbs and salads. * * * * Nevertheless 
our stranger had no compunction in awaking her, 
but the means he chose were so gentle that it seemed 
to the damsel in her dream as if a little sprig of 
thyme had touched her lips while she was stooping 
to gather the herbs." — An Italian Marketplace. —

'Would you kindly get those Soissons haricots 
fetched, which I see at the end of the table. * * 
* * I beg also your favorable notice for the 
small marsh beans, sometimes called English beans ; 
when still green they are a dish for the gods." — 
Savarin. 

* It is said that we are indebted to Alexander the 
Great for the introduction of this bean into Europe, 
for while marching on his victorious route in India 
his eye fell upon a field of these plants. They ap- 
peared to him very inviting, and finding them good 
for food he highly recommended them to his coun- 
trymen." 

"The Romans preserved them with vinegar and 
garum, and they were handed round at the begin- 
ning of a feast to excite the appetites of the guests." 

"About Bari? Surely — a seaport on the Adriatic 
coast. You may see plenty of Bari trading vessels 
at Ancona and Venice. Our neighbor Sacch', who 
understands the wholesale business as well as any 
man in town, gets all his oil from Bari. Being 
brought by sea to Venice, it comes cheaper than the 
oils of Florence and Lucca, which have to be 
brought across the Apennines. Don't you know 
the proverb, 'Bari for oil, Trani for figs, Otranto for 
pretty women?' " — Lord Brackenbury.

Salade Jardiniere. 



With peas, asparagus points and other green 
vegetables really green, beets blood red, and first- 
rate aspic jelly for border, and flowers, nothing goes 
to table I hat is more showy than this. 

Cat a number of difi'erent colored root vegetables 
in slices and boil them till done in salted water — a 
white turnip, a yellow rutibaga, a red carrot, salsi- 
fy, parsnip, broad celery stalks, almost anything for 
variety. 

When done stamp them all out in little star shapes 
or flower fchapes, with a tin vegetable cutler, not 
much larger than a^silver dime. 

Also stamp out a quaotity of the same star shapes 
of cooked beets, the deepest red, and keep them 
ready in vinegir, separate. 

Boil a corresponding proportion of asparagus 
heads green, also some g'^een peas (unless you cm 
get the French peas, and half a can may do), and 
string beans and chives, etc. A small quantity of 
the French ognons, or small seed onions sold in bot- 
tles, is alsT a de*-irable addition. Cut the string 
beans in diamond shapes. 

Mix all these vegetables, except the beets and a 
sprinkling of the peas or asparagus points, together 
with enough oil and vinegar to moisten, and turn 
them from one bowl to another a few times. 

Pile in the middle of the dishes, and pour thin 
mayonaise over, and scatter the star shapes of beets 
and the green peas all over the top. 

Around the edge of the dishes place blocks of am 
ber jelly, lettuce leavesi, tiny bunches of cress, flow- 
ers, etc., all or part, according to fancy. 

The jelly should be cooled in dishes, in depth 
about half an inch, cut in perfect cubes, then cut 
across, to form three-sided blocks. For all these 
ornamental purposes it is generally necessary to 
clarify the aspic jeliy a second time— it makes it 
firmer and of a more golden richness of appearance. 
All things in this class are Yor style. Good work- 
manship tells. Better never attempt them at all 
than make them but tawdry imitations. 



T41. To Boil Vegretables Green. 



Let asparagus, peas and string beans lie in cold 
water an hour or two before cooking, then put them 
into water that is already boiling, but just before 
putting them in, drop a little bi-carbonate of soda 
into it. A pinch of carbonate of ammonia does as 
well. Too much of either makes the vegetables soft 
and yellow. 

The French green ^Q&a—petits pois — are better 
than ours, chiefly because they are gathered while 
young enough, so, likewise, are the English, but 
American peas never are — except in California. 



The French petits pots are made so green by the 
addition of a small quant i-y of Vichy salt to the 
water they are canned in, aa alkaline salt from the 
f imous springs. Bi-carbona(e of soda wiih salt has 
about the same effect. 

Spinach, summer cabbag?*, Brussels sprouts and 
the like are kept green ^hile boiling by the same 
treatment as asparagus and peas. Green celery 
leaves — useful in salad making — need no alkali to 
green then, the boiling water is sufficient. 

74S. 

When using the coarser outside stalks of celery 

for any purpose that requires them to be cooked 
scrape the tough sinews from the back — much as 
you would scale a fish — and the celery will be great- 
ly improved.

"Heliveth well wholoveih well

*• 'Are you a favorer of the olive ?' said Lord G — . 

*No,' said I, *I love^it^not ; it hath an under taste 
of sourness and an upper of oil, that do not make 
harmony to my palate*' " — Bulwer. 

In the aalade jardiniere, and the two next to come, 
you can put away that bottle of queen olives — in the 
jardiniere as a border ornament instead of jelly, and 
in the others as part cf their composition, and be 
done with the perplexity. For it. is perplexing, 
seeing the queen olive's visits to the kitchen are so 
few and far between, to have somebody set the bot- 
tle on the table in a perfectly matter-of-course way 
saying, "As we want this to be a very nice afi'air 
you can have some olives for your salad,*' and then 
walk off". Now what are you to do with queen 
olives to be fine for all they are worth ? You have 
heard of a gentleman who is at all the outside par- 
ties and festivals where you have to send your con- 
tributions of boned turkeys and roast hams and 
things, who is a terror because he is a critic, and 
who always atjthose places makes the people a salad 
with olives. And it is the olive part that gives the 
impression of style, wherefore you likewise must 
do something great, and there's your bottle of olives. 

Now you wish your people were Italians, to eat 
their olives plain, like these in Lothair: 

"On this morn, this violent morn, a few fishermen 
in one of the country boats happened to come in, 
about to dry a net upon a sunny bank. Lothair ad- 
mired the trim of the vessel, and got talking with 
the men ae they ate their bread and olives, and a 
small fish or two." 

Or like these ia Lord Brackenbury : 

**So La Giulietta hurries in to spread the table; 
and presently they are all silting together at their 
evening meal — a meal literally of Attic simplicity, 
consisting of bread, salad, salted olives, a kind of 
sweet cake made with chestnut flour, aud a measure 
of country wine in a wicker flask.'

THE AMERICAN COOK. 



Or like these in Don Quixote : 

"They were all good-looking young fellows ; each 
had his wallet, whicb, as it soon appeared, was well 
stored, at least with relishing incentives to thirst, 
and such as provoke it at two leagues distance. 

They laid themselves along on the ground, and, 
making the grass their table-cloth, there was 
presently a comfortable display of bread, salt, nuts, 
and cheese, with some bacon bones, which, though 
they would not bear picking, were to be sucked 
with advantage. Caviare too was produced — a kind 
of black eatable, made of the roes of fish : a notable 
awakener of thirst. Even olives were not wanting, 
and though somewhat dry, they were savory and in 
good keeping. But the glory of the feast was six 
bottles of wine." 

An English authority, too, advising on the make- 
up of a supper, says it will be as well to provide a 
few olives for the gentlemen ; but means them plain, 
in pickle dishes. 

In a little menu of an ancient dinner of Washing- 
ton's, recently discovered among the family relics, 
that was printed in the Reporter ^ olives plain ap- 
pears twice. However, our gentleman makes salads 
with olives in. 



Salade de Lefirumes, 



a ritalienne. 



A match to the jardiniere salad, and, like it, made 
of several varieties of vegetables cut in forms. No 
msiyonaise needed unless for ornamental piping, 
like icing patterns on a cake. The distinctive 
feature is the border- mould of vegetable patterns 
and mosaics set in jelly ; in the hollow center the 
plainer colored vegetables being piled, seasoned only 
with oil, salt, pepper, and tarragon vinegar. As 
the large moulds are almost useless for individual 
ser.vice, and even at parties are seldom if ever cut, 
the writer uses individual border moulds, which 
any tinner can make. They are of size and shape 
to fit the small dishes, from 2^ to 3 inches long, and 
farm a trench or border an inch deep, the jelly, etc., 
moulded therein forming a rim for the dish, the 
centre being vacant. 

1. Take a scollop scoop — not too small and tedi- 
ous — one that scoops a sort of cblong shell shape or 
berry out of vegetables — and scoop about a cupful 
of potatoes raw, and then cook them in salted water. 
Also a cupful of cooked beets, same shape, and per- 
haps other vegetables, and a like quanti<y of shapes 
of white of eggs. Prepare likewise some cooked 
string beans by cutting them of same length, and 
stone a bottle of olives. 

Set the small border moulds in a pan that i? set in 
another pan of ice, water, and salt. Drop 3 or 4 
olives in each and fill in between with the mixed 



colored sh'ipes of vegetables and white of eggs, and 
fill up with amber aspic jelly 

While the borders are setiing prepare the inside 
filling. Choose cauliflower, potatoes', asparagus, 
beets, and green peas ; cook them, divide the c.uli- 
flower into small flowerets, cut the polatoes and 
beets in very small dice, use only the green heads 
of the asparagus, season them all with tarragon 
vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. Turn the jelly bor- 
ders out of their moulds and pile the other mixture 
in the middle. 

2. Another way without border moulds is to 
spread the mixed shapes of vegetables and egg white 
over a large platter, pour on jelly to cover them, 
and, whea set, wi h a sharp knife cut across in 
diamonds, and then divide these across forming 
triangles, carefully without dragging and displacing 
the vegetables. Take up these triaoglea with sugar 
tongs and dipping one edg8 in melted jelly set them 
up around the dish, and fill the ce ntre as in the 
other. The olives may be used mixed in the centre 
filling, or as ornaments, alternating with the jelly 
shapes. 



Huge salads of this kind are made for banquets 
and ball suppers, sometimes in pyramidal form, the 
sides of the moulds elaborately dtcorated with pat- 
terns of white of egg3 (that has been steamed in a 
mass shallow in a pan, for large leaves, etc , to be 
stamped out), and asparagus set up in jelly in full 
length, with white and red rosea of turnips and 
beets. These are ornamental pieces and for nothing 
else. 



The honeycombed vegetables left after cutting or 
scooping can be steamed and mashed, the beets can 
often be chopped and used in another salad. 



There are knives of peculiar shape sold for 
stoning olives. It makes a difierence if the olives 
be the large kind and not such as now sometimes 
come in kegs. 



'^46. 



Salade a la Russe. 



Various mixtures of fish and vegeiaoies, ^ith 
olives, pickles, capers and the like are called Kus- 
sian salad, the disiinguishing feature, however, is 
the Russian salad dressing of highly gea-oned jelly 
whipped toafroih, The ge'atine manufacturers have 
caused to be pretty well known certain sweet trifles 
made by whipping lemon jtl y while cooling on ice 
to a froth resembling whiie of egg^, and then called 
lemon snow, snow puddiog, aud the like. These 
are known as Russian jel y or jelly a la Russe in 
French cookery. The Russian salad jelly is the 
same thing with ealad seasonings instead of sweets. 
It may be either white, red, green or yellow ; and

when ornamental border moulds are made with it 
the variatiors a'e to get red fleshed fishes such as 
Ijbsterj, shrimps and silmon to show in the white 
jelly, and while fish and sometimes chicken, ecalded 
oyttcrs and the like, to show in colored jelly. 
Olives, cipers, green {gherkins and pickled peppers 
are always in p'ace in Russian salad*?, and caviare 
is good for their ornamentation. The inside of the 
border shapes may be filled with any mixture of 
vegetables, like the Italian vegetable salad, and 
mayonaise poured over. 

Where so much depends upon individual taste it 
seems useless to give minute directions. 

To make the jelly melt a pint of good firm aspic 
jelly, then whip it wi h an egg beater, in a pan of 
ice water, addicg at the same time a quarter pint of 
olive oil and a little less of mixed vinegars — chili 
and tarragon — or lemon juice and some plain 
vinegar. To make the jelly very white whip one or 
two whites of eggs to a froth and stir them in just as 
it begins to be too firm to beat. 

The red fishes should be cut in pieces of even siz?, 
mixed in the jelly, togHher with the olives, capers 
and shapes of pickles, and the moulds immediately 
filled. A good efi"ect m 3y be produced by dropping 
into the white jelly little cubes of clear jelly of 
diflferent colors. 

To color this whipped jelly red use beet vinegar, 
or lobster spawa pounded and rubbed through a 
fine f eive. For yellow mix mayonaise dre-sing in 
it iastead of oil and vinegar. For green use the 
juice pressed out of pounded raw spinach leaves, or 
of cooked celery leaves. 

Stone the olives and fill I hem with chopped mixed 
pickles before putting them in the salad. 



If the lobster holds the most prominent place 
among salads we guess it must be because the Old- 
World cooks, purveyors, major-domos and kings' 
tasters have thrust it fjrward for its bright color to 
make their set tables look like piciures. Looking 
back through an American cooking experience of 
about thiriy yeirs the writer has never had reason 
to regard it as particularly delicious eating. Con- 
spicuous ia the foreign menu cert;;iii'y, but who 
can Gill to mind where any writer has eulogized 
lobster salad or held up the lobster for anything but 
a comparison f.r somebody's red face? Somewhere 
Thackeray who mentions everything eatable, and 
each at its proper style of table, and^ who knew what 
was good, mentions lobster and I .bster salad, but in 
b th places they are in the hands of low-down per- 
sons ; one of them in a duety place at a fair. 

'746> Lobster Salad. 

MAYONAISE DE HOMARD, ETC. 

1. The Lirgest quintity of lobster can be dis- 
posed of at hotel tables by serving it (after taking 



the meat out cf the shell) plain, whh only a little 
good vinegar poured over in the dish, and 2 or 3 
cripp leaves of heart lettuce. It is one of the 
pleasures of the table for some people to make their 
own salads. 



2. Cut the lobster as nearly in dice shape as may 
be, leaving the scraps and crumbs to be used for 
some other purpose — as fish sauce, croquettes, lob- 
ster cutlets, etc. — and mix it with an equal quantity 
of boiled potatoes cut to correspond, in the hollan-» 
daise salad dressing. Use shred lettuce to garnish. 



3. Chop 6 or 8 heads of white celery and stir in- 
to it a Utile oil, vinegar, popper and salt. 

Select enough fine large pieces of the lobster meat 
for about 25 individual dishes ; steep them in oil, 
vinegar, pepper and salt in a bowl, and dish one or 
two pieces laid diagonally on a spread out spoonful 
of the eelery. 



4. Prepare the mayonaise salad dressing with 
lemon juice insiead of vinegar, or part of the vine- 
gar. 

Chop six heads of celery with enough of the tend- 
erest green tops mixed in to make it all light green. 
Cut the lobster in pieces all of one size and keep out 
the reddest meat in a dish by itself. 

Dish a layer of the chopped celery in flat individ- 
ual dishes ; then lobster on that with the red pieces 
strewn at the edge where they will show among the 
green ; then another spoonful of celery on top of the 
lobster, and press down the top slightly. Pour the 
mayonaise over just thin enough to run and mask 
without hiding the colors'. These salads look like 
tufts of moss. 



5. Steep the lobster in oil, vinegar, pepper and 
salt. Dish on flat dishes, spread thick mayonaise or 
other dressing on top, and decorate with quarters 
of boiled eggs, olives, pickles, capers, chopped let- 
tuce, etc., as for shrimp salads. 



T47. 

Lobsters, crabs, crayfish and shrimps are all 
cooked by dropping them alive into boiling water, 
sailed. It is the old world fashion of the fishermen 
who bring in the daily market supply of shrimps, 
to boil them in sea water, on their way in. They 
have boilers set in brick work in their boats for the 
purpose. And so, it is said, do the lobster fishers of 
Gaspe Bay, where lobsters do most abound. 
Shrimps take but a few minutes to cook, lobsters 
take half an hour and more. 



198 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



The lobster coral or spawn, if these furrdshcd 
happen to conta.n any, can be used, pounded and 
rubbed through a eeive, to mix with mayonaise to 
give it a red color and serve for variety in orijamen- 
tation. Another great use of the coral is to make 
iobster butter by pounding it with an equal amount 
of fresh butter and rubbing through aseive. Add 
Bome lemon juice and chopped parsley. A tolerable 
iubstitute is the red claw meat of the lobster. This 
butter is used for spreading on bread or toast to 
build up salads on, and for sticking large pieces of 
lobster together. If seldom eaten it may be that 
the nature and composition of red butter is not gen- 
erally understood. However, it goes well as a cold 
sauce with hot fish, and in that way is never wasted. 

Then there is green sauce. Just lately I was 
trapped into reading a bill of fare. It was a Christ- 
mas bill, printed large, and set in a restauraLt 
window among the ornamented dishes of an evidi;n^- 
ly good cook, and the novelty of it was salmon wi h 
green sauce. Why green sauce instead cf ravi^ote, 
remoulade, Montpellier, or something else that con- 
veys no picture to the mind ? But green sauce 
stretches away back to the time of the old Ramans, 
and perhaps beyond them to the Babylonians and 
Persians. 

Here, comparatively recent, yet writlen three 
hundred and seventy years ago, is a French book 
talking about green sauce : 

" *It is,' said Panurge, *my lords the king of the 
clouted hose. I intend to make him an honest man, 
I will put him to a trade, and make him a crier of 
green-sauce. Go to, begin and cry ; Do you lack 
any green-sauce ? And the poor devil began to 
cry.' " 

Truly, green s^ace might mean * garden- sass" or 
other things, but here are particulars : 

"Pantagruel gave them a little lodge near the 
lower street, and a mortar of stone wherein to bray 
and pound their sauce." 

It must be inferred that green-sauce has at some 
times been cried as a marketable article like pop- 
corn. Green sauce, the simple base, in modern 
French cookery is called ravigote, and consists of 
some half dozen kinds of herbs — tarragon, chives 
parsley, burnet and others, pounded io a green 
pulp and then pressed through a seive. Of this 
Ude, and then Ctreme made a dozen diflp rent com- 
binations in hot sauces, like mint sauce with roist 
lamb, and cold green sauces and butters. Some of 
these are used solely for salads, Montpelier butter 
particularly, spread on toast as an ornamental 
border or foundation for lobster and fish. The ex- 
pressed juice of pounded spinach leaves is relied 
upon for coloring a deeper green, and boiled celery 
leaves ^ill answer as well. These sauces and con- 
diments are not likely to become Americanized hz- 
cause of the danger of ignorant cooks using artificial 
green colorings, which are nearly all poisonous. 



T48. 



Lobster in the Shell. 



Divide the lobster in convenient-sized pieces, crack 
the claws with a hammer, and serve p'ain ; the best 
pieces only, the fragments can be put to other uses. 
Send in a quarter of lemon on each dish. 



T40. 



Buisson of Lobsters or Prawns. 



The buisson or bush of lobsters, so often appear- 
ing in menus of banquets, is the same as would be a 
pyramid cf anything else. It is an ornamental 
style of serving lobster in the shell for a large num- 
ber, and sometimes the smallest lobsters are chosen 
for the purpose. The ways are various. The lob- 
sters are fastened overlapping each other, tails up- 
wards, in pyramid9l form on a tall and slender 
evergreen bush — a Christmas tree in efifect — with 
their claws, horns and eyes looking out menacingly 
from among the green. Another way is to make a 
pyramid of pressed corned beef incased in jelly and 
stick the lobsters in like form on that with silver 
headed skewers, filling in with greens and flowers. 
Prawns on the same plan and smaller scale Little 
pyramids of shrimps and prawns are made by cut- 
ting a long loaf of bread in pineapple shape and 
sticking the unpicked shrimps all over it by their 
horns. Picked shrimps are similarly made to cover 
tall shapes moulded in cold butter. There is pileuty 
of room to depart from these suggestions and fur- 
nish new designs. 

"What a pleasure it is to have a good appetite, 
when one is certain of soon having an excellent din- 
ner!" * * * "Of all the qualities 
of a cook, the most indispensible is punctuality." — 
Savarin. 

* That all-3oftening, overpowering knell, 
The tocsin of the soul — the dinner bell." 

— Byron. 

Some hotels now make a public exhibit of their 
Christmas meats and delicacies. I think sometime 
there will be a new fashion of particg oflf a portion 
of the dining room with a glass partition, in which 
room, as through a shop window, the compul orily 
idle guests instead of watching the clock hand drag 
its slow loL'gth along will be allowed to see going on 
the cleacly and fireless process of salad making and 
decoration ; the construction of the latest novelties 
iu confeciioneries and bcquets of fruits; the orna- 
mentation of boned turkeys and the like after new 
designs furnished by the Lakeside Society of Decora- 
tive Art — Culinary Branch. Then the dining ro: m 
will not be so wrapped in a dim religious light, and 
so formidably closed and bolted but that the sl'p- 
pered stewards and waiters may be seen busy with 
their preparations for the good dinner to come

T50. Fish Salad. 

FILLETS OF FISH EN MAYONAISE. 

1. The kinds of fish tl at will fall apart in flakes, 
Buch as silmoo, turb )t, halibut, redfish, and fresh 
cod may be msde ia salads ia the same ways as 
lobsters, shrimps and oysters, already directed. 
But table sauce?, ketchups, sny, and essence of an- 
chovies, can be added to the dressings according to 
taste. 

Of India soy Savarin says : "It seems likely the 
Roman garum was a foreign sauce ; perhaps even 
the 'soy* which we get from India, and which is 
known to be got by the fermentation of a mixture of 
fish and mushrooms." 

T51. 

2. Fillets of fish are the whole sides freed from 
bones and skin. For individual dishes cut these 
into smaller fillets, about the size of fingers. Lay 
them to steep a while in oil, vinegar, pepper and 
salt, and dish on a bed of chopped celery. Then 
over each fillet pour a spoonful of mayonaise. 

3. For a mayonaise of fillets of soles or brook 
trout : Skin the fish before cooking, and likewise 
split down the back and take the bones out. Roll 
the boned fish up in fioger shape and lay them close 
together in a pan. Pour in some broth with a dash 
of vinegar, salt, white pepper, a piece of onion and 
some parsley. Cover wifh a bright flat lid, put but- 
tered paper over that and cook in the oven 20 or 80 
minutes. There should be little or no liquor left in 
the pan. Put a small weight on the lid to press the 
fillets, and set them away to get cold. 

When to be made in mayonaise trim the ends ofi^. 
Moisten the fillets with oil and vinegar in a bowl, 
and bui'd them up, if for a large dish, around a 
conical pile of chopped celery or lettuce and pour 
the dressing over all. Garnish with lemons.

Boiling Fish. 



The get along-without policy of neglecting to pro- 
vide the kitchen with necessary utensils operates 
serious y against good cookery in average hotels. 

There is no question but that in the fitting up of 
every new hotel some money is wasted in buying 
useless articles to suit»the cranks and notions of the 
chef that is going to take charge — things like costly 
copper mouMs, bain maries, patent machines, etc., 
which none of his successors in the same place will 
ever use, and proprietors having had experience of 
such follies are apt to take a grim revenge by re- 
fusing to buy any uncommon article at all. Now 
there must be, and it pays to have in the kitchens 
even of small and unpretentious houses, a fish boi'er 
wiih its drainer or false bottom and hooked upright 
at each end to lift it and the fish out by ; a slock 
boiler with its false bottom and faucet; a potato 
fryer with its suspended drainer ; a time-saving 



large coff'eo mill, and other things scarcely leis im- 
portant but none of them commonly to be found. 
It pays because some of the finest fishes are finest 
flavored when boiled, and if they can not be for 
want of the proper appliances they have to suffer 
deterioration by more expensive frying and baking, 
A fish may be boiled in a stove wash-boiler and 
fished out with two skimmers, but no company will 
insure it against breakage. What must be must, 
and in such a case you had better roll up the fish in 
a clem pudding-cloth, tying the ends and pinning 
the middle, and carefully roll it out on to its dish 
when done. 

Any tinner can make b. poissoniere or fish boiler. 
It should be long enough for a good sized Mackinaw 
trout whole, and wide enough for two or three on 
the drainer. It has sides straight up and a lid. 

To boil a large trout, whitefish, redfish, sheephead 
or salmon for ealad : Scale and clean the fish, clip 
off the fins but leave the head and tail on, and lay it 
in a pan of cold water. Draw some clear soup- 
stock into the fish kettle (the stock is already slight- 
ly seasoned with vegetables), to one-third fill it. 
Throw in a basting-spoonful of salt, a tablespoonful 
of pepper-corns, half a bay leaf, a small onion with 
six cloves stuck in it and a small piece of horse- 
radish. A'so a cupful of wine if afforded, sherry or 
claret — keep the cheap sweet angelicas and the like 
for ices and jellies — if no wine half a cup of vinegar 
instead. Let this liquor come to a boil, then wipe 
the fish clean and dry, lay it on the drainer and let 
come to a boil quickly. Then put on the lid and 
move the ket'le to the side of the range to simmer 
slowly. Rapid boiling breaks the fish. Too much 
cooking softens it. 

Half an hour is the average time it takes to boil a 
fish just done, but varies according to the eize. 
Redfish and salmon, being solid fleshed, bear longer 
boiling than lake trout. Cool the fish in the liquor 
it was boiled in. 



753. 

Redfish, Whitefish or Trout in Aspic 
Jelly. 

An ornamental dish. Border moulds are needed, 
common jelly moulds will do. 

Take the boiled fish ice-cold from the liquor it 
was boiled in, wipe off with a napkin dipped in hot 
water, peel off the skin; then wi;h broad knives 
split the fiah down tbeback, remove the bone and 
lay the two fillets on a cutting board. It makes the 
hands mest dish to have a red or pink or yellow- 
flesbed fish to alternate with the whi'e. 

Get ready a pan of water, ice and sdt (freezing 
mixture) to dip the moulds in to set the jelly quick- 
ly. Cut the fishes in finger-like strips. 

Flavor some melted jelly with chi'i vinegar and 
table sauce poured off clear, then co^t the moulds 
with it by turning a little around in them till set.

THE AMEBICAN COOK. 



Place the pieces of fish in upright order around 
the mould with something to make ornamental 
stripes betwixt each piece — it may be the chopped 
red meat of lobster, a fine line of chopped yolk ol 
egg, picked shrimps, or chopped parsley or tender 
green celery leaves. 

One side of the mould has to be finished at a time, 
a little jelly poured over and allowed to set in the 
ice water, to be then turned over and the other side 
lined. With a number of moulds to work on there is 
no time lost. 

For the inside filling mix aspic jelly and thick 
mayonaise in about equal quantities, and beat it 
light on ice; just before it sets stir in chopped 
celery or white lettuce, or both, and when the fish- 
lined moulds are filled — or the hollow border if 
border moulds be used — let them set in a cold place 
till to be served. The dishes should be garnished 
with a border of picked leaves of water cress, and 
something to show it is fish, as shrimps or pieces of 
lobster, or better still, some of the smallest fish ob- 
tainable, incased in clear jelly whole, like oysters in 
aspic, and laid in order around. 



A good deal of deteriorated and ill-savored food is 
sent to hotel tables through the semi-accidental fer- 
mentation of soup stocks, liquors in which fish are 
left to cool, and the like, and never so much as 
when the preparation of a banquet requires some 
things to be made a good while before. This is not 
through want of skill in making, but want of care in 
keeping. It is next to impossible for a large kettle 
of fish boiled over night, or a large body of soup 
stoek to remain unchanged till next day, a sort of 
"salt-rising" fermentation sets in. This is not to 
run down hotel cookery but point the remedy. 
Always cool off soup stock in several shallow pans 
and stir once in a while, and never set fish away in 
the kettle more than one fish deep ; and the kettle 
should be tipped once or twice while cooling to ex- 
pel the heat from the center. After that there is no 
risk of a bad taste. 



And, before we get too far from green sauce: 
There is a book in the British museum all about 
trout, that was written by a cook and published 
within a few years of Izaak Walton's Complete 
Angler. In a rhyming preface the author says : 

' 'Forty years in ambassadors' kitchens I 
Learned the art of cookery. " 
And he has ''trout pie to eat hot/' and "trout pie to 
eat cold," and "cold trout in armour of green," in 
which we find the same old pounded herbs, or 
ravigote, mixed with butter and seasonings, and 
spread smoothly all over the cold boiled fish, which 
is then ornamented with thin sliced pickles to imi- 
tate scales and gills. This is done with truffle slices 
in modern French cookery, and the dish gees by 
another name. 754, 

Another dish of fish in armor of green, necessary 



for those to be posted in who would get up novel, if 
very old, dishes for banquets is: 

Mix thick mayonaise with a third as much aspic 
jelly and color it green with the juice from pounded 
spinach leave?. When so nearly set as not to run 
spread it evenly over a cold boiled fish raised on a 
bread or chopped celery foundation, and decorate 
with truffles, whole yolks of eggs, aspic jelly or 
sliced or quartered lemons. 



For if the salad makers and their work had not 
some strange charm of mystery for the public why 
should the novelists make so much use of the man 
who can make a mayonaise ? 

That man is nearly ubiquitous in English fiction — 
if we had time to follow him — not that mayonaise is 
always as. plainly mentioned as in the instance in 
our opening column, but it is implied when not 
named as one of the branches of occult knowledge 
that is to give that personage, who is oftenest a 
valet, a hold upon your imagination. 

The man who can make a mayonaise, whom every 
reader knows, is done up in the smallest parcel per- 
haps in Felix Bolt : 

<*0h! one of those wonderful Southern fellows 
that make one's life easy. He's of no country in 
particular. I don't know whether he's most of a 
Jew, a Greek, an Italian, or a Spaniard. He speaks 
five or six languages, one as well as another. He's 
cook, valet, major-domo, and secretary all in one; 
and what's more, he's an affectionate fellow — I can 
trust to his attachment. That's a sort of human 
specimen that doesn't grow here in England, I 
fancy. * * * * The old servants 
will have to put up with my man Dominic, who will 
show them how to cook and do everything else, in a 
way that will rather astonish them." 

Here he crops out in Thackeray's Virginians : 

"Gumbo had a hundred accomplishments. * * 
* * He was great at cooking mauy of his 
Virginian dishes, and learned many new culinary 
secrets from my Lord's French man." 

Now we all know those secrets were how to make 
a mayonaise or two, but the authors do not always 
know as much as their characters — how valuable 
must have been the salad-making knowlege pos- 
sessed by Count Fosco, in the Woman in White — he 
an Italian, a Count, and with domestic proclivi- 
ties — but which the author forgot to give to the 
world ! 

These men of extraordinary knowledge have to do 
other things than make strange dishes for the 
French reader. The same sort of valet or major- 
domo, in Dumas' Queen's Necklace, alone knows 
where there is but just one bottle of a priceless 
wine left in the cellar of a distant chateau, and 
manages to steal it in time for a royal guest in so 
many hours and minutes by the clock. With all 
his acquaintance with various dishes the author of 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



201 



the Virginians missed it badly when in going over all 
he could think of that the Colonists had to eat he 
quite forgot chicken salad. Let us see : 

•'You know what I mean — shad and salmon and 
rockfish and roedeer and hogs and buflfalos and 
bisons. * * Countless quantities of shad 
and salmon, wild geese, wild swans, pigeons and 
plovers, and myraids of canvas-backed ducks. ^ 
* The gumbo was perfection, the shad were 
rich and fresh — stewed terrapins — sweets and flans 
— Mr. Justice, you love woodcock pie? * * 
And now the sweets and pudding are come, of 
which I can give you a list if you like ; but what 
young lady cares for the puddings of to-day, much 
more for those which were eaten a hundred years 
ago?" 

It is of no use looking. There are some grand 
Virginian feasts but Hamlet is left out. There is 
cold roast turkey, but no Virginian chicken or turkey 
salad. 



It is pretty certain if Madam Esmond, who had 
"such a hand for light pastry," made chicken salad 
in Virginia a hundred years ago, the chicken was 
first cut in bits about an inch long, and then pulled 
apart in shreds, for that is the way American house- 
wives of to-day say it should be done ; but then 
that lady had plenty of help. There is no 
slower operation than pulling chicken meat into 
fine shreds, and hotel cooks can't. 

T55. 

Fowls to be cooked should always be sorted, and 
generally be boiled separately — the old and the 
young — for while some will be done in less than an 
hour others take 4 or 5 hours. To find when they 
are tender lift from the boiling liquor with a fork 
and pinch the flesh of the drumstick. To know 
when they are young, before cooking, try the point 
of the breast bone. When fowls have done growing 
the entire breast bone hardens, before that it can be 
bent. A more reliable testis, try if you can push 
your thumb through the thin skin that stretches be- 
tween the joint of the wings. It is quite essential to 
make the matter of age sure before boiling a boned 
fowl done up in cloth. 



V56. 



Chicken Salad. 



Boil 3 or 4 fowls in the stock boiler and when 
done tender set them away to get cold. 

1. Cut all the meat of the fowls into strips, and 
then across, making dice shapes, and as small as 
time will allow, but don't chop it. 

Cut 6 or 8 heads of celery the same way. 

Prepare either the mayonaise or the salad dressing 
made wi'h cooked yolks. 

Mix with both the chicken and the celery, but 
seperately, a li> tie eil, vinegar, pepper and ealt — 
>ist enough to moisten and make them look juicy- 



then press the chicken into an oval mould such as a 
melon mould or common jelly mould or a deep dish. 
The oil, etc., will cause it to preserve a good shape. 
Turn it out on to a flat meat dish. Spread the thick 
mayonaise all over and smooth it with a knife, and 
place the seasoned celery around with a spoon. 
Decorate the salad with whatever may be con- 
venient, not always alike. A rose cut out of a beet, 
or a row of them, with parsley or other green, 
natural flowers, capers, sliced hard-boiled eggs and 
so forth, or chopped red cabbage sparingly sprinkled 
over, or cut lemons. 

Individual dishes just the same as above, but 
shaped in individual moulds, or in egg cups can 
have a cherry scooped out of a coc ked beet on top, 
or a green pickle — ways that are short and speedy, 
and olives either plain or stoned and stuffed come in 
good place. 



2. It is not essential to have a salad dressing for 
the above, but does well enough to add more oil and 
vinegar to the chicken and mince the celery fine. 
Celery so minced and mixed with oil and vinegar 
has a buttery appearance and will keep shape 
when moulded, as it may be to form a border. Gar- 
nish with sliced or quartered eggs beside. 

3. Cut the chicken small. Prepare one-third as 
much celery and a similar quantity of green lettuce. 
Mix all and pour over a thin mayonaise or other 
dressing in a bowl. Combine thoroughly, and dish 
up spoonfuls piled a little in flat dishes. 

Border of small lettuce leaves, shred lettuce or 
minced yolks of eggs. This should not be pasty, 
as thick dressing would make it. 

Y5t. 

Veal salad may be made like chicken.. It is best 

to call it veal salad and make it as good as chicken 
if possible. 



758. 



Turkey Salad. 



The same as chicken salad. In cutting up the 
meat it is best to leave out the thick fat skin. With 
chickens it makes no difference. 

759, Mayonaise of Chicken. 



Bone 4 young but plump chickens. There need 
be no difficulty in this. First cut down the back 
and then cut close to the bones. It makes no 
difference if you do cut through the skin once in a 
while. Carve through the hip joints, inside, and 
take the leg bones out after those of the carcass. 
Wash the chickens in cold water, dry them, lay out 
on a table and dredge plentifully with pepper and 
salt. Then lay two together, the white meat of one 
on the dark meat of the other, double or roll them 
up loosely, tie round with twine and boil them ia 
the stock boiler an hour. 



202 



THE A2ffEBICAN COOK. 



When done take oflF the twine and hj the chicVrns 
out flat on two large plaiters, place other platters 
en top, set in a c >ld place and a weight on to press 
them to about an inch in thicknesB. 

When quite cold cut the edges of the pressed 
fowls square and divide them in shapes all of ote 
size. Oblongs and parallel'-grams are most in stjie, 
and tbey laid not straight in the dish but slantwise, 
leaTiDg the ends of the dish for the garoish. Pre- 
pare some majonaise of savory jeily by mixing 
thick mayot'ai?e with a third as much aspic jelly 
and when about to set pour a coating over each 
piece of the chicken placed on large dishes for the 
purpose. 

Prepare the small dishes — 25 or 80 of them — 
with a bed sometimes of chopped green salad 
material or white celery, at others with finely 
minced eggs. 

Mince also a spoonful of piclled blood beets, the 
iame of green pickles and mix them with a like 
quantity of minced yolk of eggs, but only the 
minute before using, less the beets color them all. 

When the dressing on the chicken is perfectly 
cold and set take each piece on a fork in the end 
and lightly dip the npper side in the minced beets 
etc., on a plate, and place it on its dish. At each 
end phce a slice of lemon. 



Jelly mixed wi*h cream sauce in proportion to 
make it set can be used in place of the mayonaise. 



Chickens cut up in joints, after boiling and cool- 
ing, and the pieces smoothly trimmed, can be 
dressed as above and for a large dish may be piled 
around a center of lettuce salad. 

V60. Fillets of Fowl in Aspic. 



This way of getting the fillets ready, if not quite 
the best, is easier for everybody to practice than 
faking them off raw and braising with wine and 
seasonings. 

Cut the breasts from 4 boiled fowls while hot, 
taking them off with a pointed knife cloue to the 
'bone, with care not to tear or let the under fillet 
separate from the large one. 

Dip these whole fillets in the stock they were 
boiled in, dredge wi»h salt and white pepper and 
then press them bciween two dishes with a weight 
on top. When qui e cold trim the fillets in<o pear 
shape, then with a sharp knife divide them in slices 
the flat, way. Lay the slices in dishes and cover 
with clear amber jelly. When that is set cut out 
tl.e fillets and jelly with a tin cutter bent lo the 
hhape. Either lay them on li tie dishes prepared 
with a bed of chopped jelly if another color, or bor- 
der them with piping of chopped jelly forced 
through a funnel or cornel made of writing paper, 
and lay a slice of lemon on top. 

Ihd f)ct is if the most splendid feasts of ficiton 



have been left incomplete and spoiled for the want 
of salads, it is because salads are un-English and 
the authors are rathtr unfortunate than to blame. 
There is a remark in A History of Our Own Timts to 
(he effect that England is govenied by phrases, and 
no phrase more powerful than to say a thing is un- 
English. And it has to be remembered King 
Ptichard fought Saladin in Palestine as King James 
fought tobacco in England, and his countrymen and 
their descendants have been languidly putting 
down salad in various ways ever since. Among all 
the incomplete banquets of English novelists, the 
man who can make a mayonaise was never bo badly 
needed as at one in the beginning of The Cloister 
andthe Ilearth. The feast is, alas, a column long 
and though quite a curiosity to culinarians is too 
long to copy. It is Aladdin's cavern garden, with 
fruit of gold and silver — the Land of Cockaigne 
with roast pig crying, "eat me !" — the wine flowing 
valley of Rasselas — a Vitellius banquet — a feast of 
Penelope's suitors — and a Lallah Roohk's attend- 
ance all joined in one Flemish prince's festivity. 
Fifteen many-colored eoups and as many wines. 
Fish in a dozen forms. Patties of lobster and al- 
monds mixed, and of almonds and cream and an 
immense variety of "brouetp," "known to us as 
rissoles." A whole hog with hair and eyes too 
naturally imitated with burnt sugar, an ox stuffed 
full of all sorts of small animals and roasted whole. 
Twenty different tarts of fruits and herbs. Con- 
fectionery on a gigantic scale. Hippocras and 
Greek and Corsican wines. But no salads ! And 
would not twenty different kinds of salads, 
jardiniere, Italienne, a la Russe, and aspics have 
shone gorgeously amidst all that splendor? It 
might be contended that Flanders was not a salad- 
making country, but Webster's dictionary eays that 
the word slaw is nothing but Flemish elaa, and that 
is only their way of pronouncing French salade ; 
and that kohl is the German for cabbage and we call 
kohl cold, so that cold slaw is in reality cabbage 
salade, that is to say is k ohl salad or 

761, COI-D SLAW. 

As served with raw oysters and sometimes with 
roast turkey or wild fowls instead of water cress, 
cold slaw is simply tender white cabbage shred as 
fine as it is possible to shred it. Served in place of 
salad at dinner it has only vinegar poured over it. 

TO». German Cold Slaw. 

2 pints of chopped white cabbage. 

1 pint of chopped apples. 

1 pint of cider vinegar. 

1 tablespoonful of white sugar. 

Salt, pepper, and some capers for garnish. 

Chop the cabbage and the apples seperately, then 
mix them and the seasoning. 

Serve large spoonfuls neatly rounded in individili* 
al flat dishes, with capers strewn over the top.

Cabbage Salad. 



Chop white cabbage, season with salt and vinegar, 
make in smooth shape in a flat dish and pour dress 
ing over (see celery salad.) 

Strew chopped beeta on top. 

The Italian and French cooks don't take kindly to 
slaw either cold or hot — seem not to understand it, 
or they think it barbarous and uncouth — and many 
of them will never ma^e ii of their own free will aud 
▼olition. Perhaps they would like it better if they 
only knew that slaa has come down in direct de- 
Bcent from their own salade and sallet. And they 
ought to peiceive that hot slaw is essentially 
nothing else but shred cabbage blanched in thin hot 
hollandaise sauce, which they are used to. 



764. 



Hot Slaw. 



3 quarts of finely shred cabbage. 

1 pint of vinegar. 

J pint of water. 

8 or 10 raw yolks of eggs. 

1 pod of red pepper, minced. 

8 ounces of butter. 

1 tablespoonful of salt. 

Put the cabbage in a bright sink of the steam 
chest, or, otherwise, in a bright saucepan placed in 
another of boiling water. Beat, the yolks in the 
vinegar and water till well mixed then add them 
ftnd the butter and salt and pepper to the cabbage. 
Stir and turn over the cabbage frequently till the 
sauce thickens and becomes like cream. It ought 
not to boil more than a minute. 



The foregoing dish stands alone. It is a class by 
itself. It cannot go under the head of salads but 
must take a pince among the vegetables. But it is 
a general favorite. There is a popular usage of 
calling all cooked green vegetables salads as well as 
garden sauce ; and there is foreign authority, 
though not very "hefiy," for styling all hot vegeta- 
bles that have a vinegar dressing, like our stewed 
beets with sour butter sauce, en salade. 

But these are not dictionary definitions. The line 
must be drawn somewhere. All salids are cold. 



Here is a place where greens are called salad. It 
is from Beverley's History of Virginia, and quoted by 
Thoreau : 

"The Jamestown weed or thorn-apple, being an 
early plant, was gathered very young for a boiled 
salad, by some of the soldiers sent to Virginia to 
quell the rebellion of Bacon ; and some of them ate 
plentifully of it, the effect of which was a very 
pleasant comedy, for they turned natural fools upon 
it] for several days : one would blow up a feather in 
the air ; anothrr would dart straws at it with much 
fury ; arid another was sitting up in a corner like a 
monkey, grinning and making mouths at them; a 



fourth would fondly kiss and paw his companions, 
and sneer in their f.ces, with a countenance more 
antic than any Dutch droll. A thousand such sim- 
ple tricks they played, and after eleven days re- 
turned to themselves again, not remembering any- 
thing that had pasted." 

It was right, of course, for them to boil greens 
when they went to quell bacon, gammon and 
spinach slways go together ; but ought not the 
properties of "Jimson weed" be thoroughly inquired 
into ? People in hotels often act with extreme 
foolishness, but landlords never think of investiga- 
ting whether there wasn't some "Jimson" in the 
greens boiled for dinner. 

The proper definii ions divide salads in two classes, 
the artificial, elaborate, compounded and peculiar 
like those just passed along, and the spontaneoup, 
natural find universal, the dinner of herbs and 
peace, like these remaining. These salads come in 
favor about the time the people who can are packing 
their trunks and discussicg the merits and demerits 
of the different summer resorts.

Lattuoe Salad. 



1. Keep the lettuces, after washing and trim- 
ming, in ice water till near dinner time. Shake the 
water from them and give them time to drain upside 
down. Dish the tender heart leaves only in shallow 
bowls, and t^liced hard-b .iled eggs on top. 

The lettuce though cold and fresh should be dry, 
except for pieces of ice strewn over in warm weather. 
The?e bowls are to be set on the dinner tables. 

Tbe freshest eggs may look bad when turned blue 
by too long bailing, but if is not certain that even 
lorg boiling will eo discolor them if they be plunged 
immediately in the coldest water. Between the 
cooks, the pantrymen, the head waiter and the 
second steward it happens that the eggs on lettuce 
nearly always come out blue. 

B"il eggs six minutes ; pour off the bot water im- 
mediately and fill up with cold. 



204 



THE AMEBIQAN COOK. 



2. Cat lettuce in shreds like oold slaw, with ft 
sharp knife, on a board kept for the purpose. Have 
some chopped eggs ready on a plate and a cupful of 
vinegar seasoned with pepper and salt in a pitcher. 

Dish up only as called for, some lettuce in a deep 
dish, the vinegar poured over, and eggs dredged on 
top. 

3, Cut the lettuce first in shreds and then across, 
quite small. It will not do to chop it in a bowl as 
that blackens it. 

Have a thin salad dressing in a pitcher separate, 
and a plate of *he smallest heart leaves of lettuce at 
hand. Dish up as called for, the lettuce in the dish, 
dressing poured all over it and two or three leaves 
set in for garnish. 

One^of the things that helps to lower the estima- 
tion people have of hotel tables is the way they have 
in some houses, where they take an interest in 
nothing but calm stagnation, of making lettuce 
salads hours before they are wanted and dishing 
them black-looking, wilted and warm. 

It ruins lettuce to let it lie in vinegar long. 



766. Lettuee Sweet Salad. 



6 or 8 heads of lettuce. 
12 small spring onions. 

1 cup of vinegar. 
^ cup of sugar. 

2 sprigs of garden mint. 

Cut the lettuce small ; slice in the white part of the 
onions with very little of the green ; chop the mint. 
Mix all. Serve cold. 



Some people say lettuce should never be washed 
as water spoils it, but be gathered fresh from the 
garden and broken into the salad bowl. That will 
do for the lady of a house, but will never do for ho- 
tel work. Here is a story some centuries old of a 
giant, that will tell why : 

"The story requireth that we relate what hap- 
pened unto six pilgrims, who came from Sebastian 
near to Nantes ; and who for shelter that night, be- 
ing afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves in the 
garden upon the chicheling pease, among the cab- 
bages and lettices. Gargantua, finding himself 
somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any 
lettice (0 make him a sallad ; and hearing that there 
Y. ere the greatest and fairest in the country (for 
they were as great as plum trees) he would' go 
thither himself, and brought thence in his hand 
what he thought good, and withal carried away the 
six pilgrims, who were in so great fear, they did not 
dare to speak nor cough. 

**Wa Ling them, therefore, first at the fountain, 
the pilgrims said one to another softly, 'What shall 
we do ? we are almost drowned here amongst these 
lettices, shall we speak ? but if we speak he will 



kill us for spies ?' As they were thus deliberating 
what to do, Gargantua put them with the lettice in- 
to a platter of the house as large as the huge tun of 
the Cistertians, which done, with oil, vinegar and 
salt, he eat them up, to refresh himself a litle before 
supper, and had already swallowed up five of the 
pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, t^^tally hid 
under the lettice, except his stafi" that appeared, and 
nothing else ; which Grangousier seeing, said to 
Gargantua, 'I think that is the horn of a shell snail, 
do not eat it." 'Why not V said Gargantua ; 'they 
are good all this month,' which he no sooner said 
but drawing up the staff, and therewith taking up 
the pilgrim, he eat him very well, then drank a ter- 
rible draught of excellent white-wine, and expected 
supper to be brought up." 

Nowadays we call those pilgrims insects. Moral : 
wash your lettuce well and look between the leaves ; 
likewise your curled endive, or chicory. 

TOT, Lettuce Salad with Oil. 

A six quart bowl of shred lettuce. 
12 hard-boiled eggs. 

1 pint of vinegar. 

1 tablespoonful of sugar. 

^ pint of olive oil. 

Pepper and salt. 

Chop the yolks and whites of the eggs separately, 
and mix the whites with the lettuce. Pour the oil 
over and stir up. Dissolve the sugar in the vinegar, 
with the salt and pepper, and add them to the let- 
tuce and toss over with a fork till well mixed. 
Strew the chopped yolks on top. 



768. 



Endive Salads. 



In all respects the same as lettuce. It is oftenest 
used with lettuce, being more ornamental to "top 
ofP' with. 



709. 



To Curl Celery. 



It is only necessary to slit the tops evenly with a 
penknife and set the celery in glasses of ice- water. 

Leave enough of the green tops on for ornament. 
Take two turns of twine round the upper part of the 
stalks for a guide-mark. The tops when slit curl 
outwards just as far down as the cuts extend and 
these should be of uniform length.

Universally a favorite in great Britain, but 
American cultivators complain that there is not 
sufficient demand for it to justify them for their 
trouble. It grows in running water, and is indig- 
enous in many of our mountain streams. It is 
used to serve with roast fowls instead of a sauce, 
for garnishing, and, eaten with salt only, as a relish 
at tea or supper. It should be carefully picked 
over and trimmed of about half the stems that are 
generally brought to market.

Onions. 



Sliced onions in vinegar are as much in demand 
as anything else in some places, however little the 
green bunches may be patronized on the hotel table. 
There is a great difference between the large white 
Spanish onion which is mild and ionocent, and the 
strong red-skinned sorts. All of them may be im- 
proved by steeping the slices in ice-water and then 
drying between two clean towels before putting in 
vinegar or mixing with sliced tomatoes or cucum- 
bers. 



TT4, 



Beets. 



Are most acceptable sliced in vinegar and served 
cold. Cooked of course till tender, though we find 
French directions for putting beets in jars of 



vinegar with carraway and coriander seeds, without 
saying whether cooked or raw. Beets are used in 
Poland, Hungary and thereabouts, fermented and 
in many other ways that would seem very outlandish 
and perhaps disgusting to Americans. 



TT5, 



Tomatoes. 



1. Serve them ofienest plain sliced in shallow 
bowls on the table either for breakfast or dinner, 
with only broken ice laid on them. 

2. Make a tomato salad by mixing in a small 
proportion of sliced cucumbers and onions and 
pouring over them vinegar, pepper and salt. Gar- 
nish with leaves of heart lettuce. 

3. Slice tomatoes in individual deep dishes and 
pour a salad dressing over. 

4. Tomatoes are liked by many people with a 
dressing of sugar and vinegar, like the lettuce sweet 
salad. 



For there is a natural craving for something 
herbaceous, green, and sour, and if debarred from 
regular salads, from vinegar and sugar, people seek 
such substitutes as nature furnishes.

776. Mock Mayonaise. 

A ctk who knows n Jhing but the best may 
fare badly sometimes if he go to a restaurant where 
he is expected to make the following and is unable 
to meet the requirement: 

Make the cooked paste precisely as if for cream 
puffs (No. 296) using butter. Perhaps half of that 
receipt will suflBce. Work in eggs the same way. 
\\hen it is nearly soft enough begin and add a 
little oil and a li'tle vinegar, then another whole 
egg, a little mustard, mrre oil and vinegar, and so 
on until it is like mayonaise. A large quantity cm 
be made wi h but little expense for olive oil in that 
way. This mock sauce is used to spread over the 
top of a chicken or lobi-ter salad in many restaur- 
ants that are called first class. 



fowl, and only call it a galantine when it is orna- 
mented. This is as it should be, for the word 
galantine in from the same root as the French 
gallantin, gallant, "a beau," "something pleasant to 
look upon," ' a nobby fellow," as it is variously de 
fined. 

Many good things on the bill of fare are partly 
thrown away for want of a popular understanding 
of the names, hence we think the space devoted to 
this question is not wasted, and now will try to ob- 
serve the distinction between plain boned turkey 
and turkey galantine. 



The custom is growing in favor everywhere and 
s particularly prevalent now in San Francisco of set- 
ting a midday lunch instead of dinner and having 
the dinner at 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening. 

This lunch makes a demand fur good work in cold 
dishes of all kinds, and gives encouragement for its 
display that is never experienced under ths plan of 
three hot meals a day. Tie various articles con- 
sidered in this category of salads and cold dishes 
have everyone of them a use for the midday cold 
meal, they can be set out to the utmost advantage, 
and become as important a part of the steward' h 
and cook's resources as the entrees, roasts and game 
for a hot dinner.

Galantines. 



A galantine, strictly, is any kind of meat with 
the bones taken out, but that is not the common un- 
derstanding ; and it is not strictly obliged to be a 
cold dish— that is according to dictionary definitions 
of th9 word — bi:t yet the general understanding is 
that it should be. In one of the royal menus re- 
cen'ly passed io review through this column there 
is a dish of galantines of quail with truflSes among 
the entrees, and, although one has no means of 
reaching a certainty on such a point, it is quite as 
likely it was a hot dish of bonelsss qu'iils as a cold 
one. The boned legs of fowls stuffed with a force- 
meat are termed galantines by one of our authorities, 
cold, however. 

Whatever may have been the meaning a hundred 
years ago it wou'd lo>k very ridiculous now to call 
a rolled up fi let of veal or a boned ribs of beef 
rolled up, a galantine, or a boned boar's head a 
gilantine. The term is applied only to fowls of a 1 
kinds andbi^ds. 

Another unwritten distinction I find is made by 
cooks — and I have met with a good many of all 
sizes, and who never knew the drift of my cross- 
questioning, and that is to call a bened fowl a boned 



Doubtless there is some sort of responsibility at- 
tached to this privilege of wide spread publicity 
through the columns of a daily newspaper. It is 
not quite the same as depositing matters snugly be- 
tween book overs, never to be opened, never to be 
seen, and no barm d ne. Perhaps it is my du y to 
bring the little power much multiplied to the rescue 
of the noble bird of Thanksgiving, the American 
turkey, from the prevai ing mi>usage which makes 
it undtr the name of boned turkey to serve but as 
a distended lion's hide to c >ver the recreant meat of 
a cilf, and this without, intent, of palming off a sham, 
but timply because of wrong teaching. 

Some two or three years ago it lay in my way to 
remark in these columns that a boned fowl should 
be stuffed with another boned fuwl, and I have 
since been told that some old parties were as much 
astonished thereat as were certain other old parties 
when Oliver Twist asked for more. Still the world 
moves. 

As for the consumer's part no words are needed 
to show him that when he asks for a plate of boned 
turkey he should not receive for it a mess of iashed 
veal in a thin-stretched turkey's skin. 

As for the landlord or employer, who is most like- 
ly to be looked npon as responsible fur the perpetra- 
tion of a species of fraud too small evfn to kick 
about, he knows nothing whatever about it, and m^y 
even have wondered that his own plate of boned 
turkey should seem so far from turkey and so near 
Bologna sauspge. The fault is with the regular 
cooks, and piimarily with the European teachers of 
cookeiy from whom all our ho el a la* a are derived. 
Were this a trick of the trade (but indeed there are 
very few tricks in our trade) of advantage econom- 
ically or otherwise, silence might be golden in 
respect to it, but while our prolific Southern and 
Western States turn off ^apultry cheaper during li

large portion of the year than vea!, it must be 
matter of gurprise that but few of our people know 
what genuiae boned turkey is, for the reason that 
the cooks ^ill push the poultry aside and take 
trouble to use veal instead at a cost about a third 
higher. This is Old-World routine. The cook does 
as he learned of an elder cook and the older refers to 
the books which direct to stuff boned turkeys, and 
indeed almost everything of the kind with minced 
veah Probably those teachers had good reasons of 
expediency. Tuj'key may have been an expensive 
luxury and had to be eked out. Possibly they 
made genuine boned turkey for kings and such, and 
thought veil good enough for people. At any rate 
they had yfhite veal that might pass for chicken. 
In any European city may be seen, or might have 
been before Mr. Bergh'a time, butchers* carts 
packed with dying calves lying on their backs, their 
heads hanging over the edge, their throats half cut, 
dripping blood over the cobble stones, making 
white veal. Our butchers are less brutal and our 
veal is less white. Some of our butchers are so 
tender-hearted they will seldom kill a calf at all 
till bis horns are well grown in the second year of 
his age, and do what you will that sort of veal al- 
ways refuses to look like chicken. We have to 
change our ways with the changed times. Our 
people are all able and wiiliog to pay for boned 
turkey and they want it, and not beef sausage. 



We will have another way of stuffing a boned 
turkey besides the annexed, but this, to use the 
words of a delighted club member, just recently, 
* takes the cheese" — whatever that may mean. The 
gentleman is a Britisher having millions in mines, 
(can't get 'em out), but, thanks to the error of 
French cookery he had never stuck his fork before 
into so unmistakably genuine a galantine as this. 



You are now able to supply to the hotel patronB 
that long felt want, a turkey all breast. 

Roll, or raiher double up carefully the smaller 
turkey and place it inside the other, remembering 
to turn it so that there will be found when the 
galantine is cut a breast at each end. Bring the 
two edges of the outside turkey together and sew it 
up with cotton twine and a large needle. Butter a 
cloth and roll the galantine up in it tightly and 
with a good many wraps, and either tie or sew it se- 
curely. Boil in soup stock with the turkey bones 
added.

Boned Turkey. 



2 turkeys. 

1 corned tongue, already cooked. 

1 pound of dry salt pork. 

8 hard-boiled eggs. 

1 cupful of aspic jelly. 

Seasonings. 

Take a large and a small turkey unopened, singe 
and wayh and then bone them, cutting first down 
the whole length of the back. When boned lay 
them skin downwards on the table and season with 
pepper and salt, or with spiced salt. Cut the cooked 
red tongue and the fat unsmoked bacon into strips 
penc.l size and lay them altercating on the turkey 
meat, lengthwise of the fowl, cutting gashes in the 
thickest parts to receive them evenly. Cut the 
yolks of tho eggs in quarters and dispose them 
evenly am ,ng the s'rips, then chop the jelly and 
strew it over. 



779. Boning a Turkey. 

Some wonders never do cease. The same con- 
jurer's trick of the speaking head which Cervantes 
says so deeply impressed poor Don Quixote still 
astonishes and mystifies some portion of the public 
at the wizard's show, and our wicked bu'chers still 
find some customers can be set strangely pondering 
when they are told that hotel cooks can take all the 
bones out of a turkey without ever cutting the skin, 
as if it were a feat like drawing a large iron ring 
through the neck of a vial. There was no dfficulty 
in making the egg stand on end when Columbus 
had damaged the shell a little, and you can get at 
the inwardness of a turkey quite easily after laying 
the skin of the back open. Cut close to the bone 
with a sharp-pointed knife till the hip joints and 
wingjoints are reached and cut partially around, 
then with the heavy handle end of a carving knife chop 
through those joints, and going a little further, 
loosening all along, the whole backbone portion can 
presently be pulled out forcibly, leaving the limbs 
and breast to be boned separately. The wings and 
drumsticks have only to be boned part way, as the 
meat is tucked into the body ; the rest may be 
chopped off. While of course neat work is better 
than slovenly it does not quite spoil the job if the 
skin does get an unkind cut sometimes ; the very 
top of the breast bone is the place requiring the 
most care ; better cut into the bone a little than 
risk a perforation where it will show so plainly on 
the galantine. 

As the turkey is to be pressed in the cloth after 
cooking there should be no bulging ends or seams in 
the way to leave their mark. 

Y80. 

Boiling and Pressing the Galantine. 

The largest and plumpest turkeys are natura'l) 
chosen for boning, especially by those who think 
boning difficult, but such turkeys are nearly always 
old and disappointment will be the result if they 
have not time enough allowed for boiling. Five 
hours is little enough for a large turkey stuffed as 
above, though two hours will be enough for a young 
one. 



208 



THE AMEBIOAN COOK. 



Th 7 have a nice letter press in the office and 
there is a clothes press in the housekeeper's room 
and another in the laundry, and a cider press in the 
milk house, that is only used once a year, but I 
don't thin it you have in the kitclen a press at all for 
galantines or pressed beef or pigs' heads or head 
cheese, a press wih assorted moulds and shapes and 
a metal tray to ca^ch the overflow. 

Let the boned turkey when done remain in the 
liquor it was boiled in till cool enough to be handled, 
then place it betweea two large platters with a fifty 
pound etone or sack of flour on the top. 

But if it is to be incised in jelly and decorated 
press it into a deep mould or pan of some sort. 

The long and narrow sinks of the steam chest, 
with their flaring sides, are suitable and make a 
handsome galantine, but common pans may answer 
if you have not special moulds. It is only the poor 
workman that finds fault with his tools. Many of 
the pretty but useless articles of the French menu 
may be as well dispensed with but boned turkey is 
(to be) an American national dish, more than the 
hunting beef or spiced round to the Old Eng ish 
squire, or than the boar's head to the Saxon thane 
cr Norman earl ; substantial, always welcome and 
when good highly appreciated, and therefore w orthy 
of effort. 

781. ~ 

Boned Turkey in Aspic Jelly. 

Warm the mould or shape and take out the 
pressed turkey. Remove the cloth, draw out the 
thread, wipe ofi" all adhering jelly and fat with a 
towel dipped in hot water and shave off" any dis- 
colored or ragged portions. With a vegetable cutler 
8'amp out half a dozen small shapes from a th ck 
sliced green pickle and place them on the boitom of 
the same mould, well washed and dried, that the 
turkey was pressed in, and place the turkey resting 
on them. This leaves a space under and around for 
a coating of aspic jelly to be poured in, and when 
quite cold and set the boned turkey can be turned 
out again on to its dish, thinly but evenly encased 
in clear jelly, which may be sliced and served with 
it. 



T88. 

To be used only to slice as cold meat the turkey 
need only have two or three coats of fresh butter 
melted and applied with a brush, the turkey being 
very cold. Ornaments of jelly, or of chopped jelly 
forced through a tube can still be added if desired in 
the individual dishes. 



Your boned turkey, whether incased in jelly or 
not, will have a h'lndsomer appearance to the con- 
sumers inside than outside, and when sent to table 
whole should always on some excuse or other be cut 



first, the halves or even the quarters of a turkey 
that is about all white meat can be edged and 
finished with decorations to look as well and in- 
finitely more appetising than any over-done "belle- 
vue" that is ever exhibited. 



We have spoken of the trifling divergence of com- 
mon usage from the strict definition of galantine, 
and have now to notice the same in regard to the 
description a la bellevue or en bellevue. It is ordi- 
narily understood by cooks and bi I rf fare writers 
to mean that the article is incased in jelly and orna- 
mented. But it is applied by old authorities to sev- 
eral other sorts of decoration besides aspic jelly, 
even to hot dishes. The word means literally a pret- 
ty eight. The modern usage is to drop bellevue 
altogether and just say the galantine is decorated 
(decoree.) 



When well done a something en bellevue is un. 
questionably a very handsome object ; the complaint 
is that a party may go to a ball supper and go away 
from it hungry for all the good a turkey done that 
way will do in the way of something to eat. It 
looks too pretty to cut — the jelly casing, not the 
turkey, v\hich indeed is not even seen — and besides 
is not suggestive of anything to eat at all. These 
things might better be made of cabinet work trans- 
parent glue and varnish and save the cook his 
wasted pains. 

783. 
Pyramid of Boned Fowls, Decorated. 



Get the tinner to make three galantine moulds of 
difi'erecit sizes flaring or tapering so that piled on 
each other upside down they will form a pyramid. 
The largest may hold six quarts, the next four, the 
smallest two quarts. 

The long and narrow shape almost like a brick, 
with the edges sharp looks as well as any, though 
they may be six or eight-sided if preferred. Pre- 
pare three boned and pressed fowls to correspond 
with the moulds, leaving plenty of room for the 
jelly. 

Prepare six quarts of aspic jelly clarified a second 
time and very firm. 

Prepare a large sheet of yellow custard made of 
sixteen yolks of eggs mixed with over half a cupful 
of clear broth and steamed in a six-quart milk pan 
set over a boiler — the pan to be buttered before the 
custard is poured in, but very slightly. 

Also prepare a similar sheet of white custard 
made of the whites of the eggd in the eame way. 

These custards when ccld are to be loosened 
round the edges and shaken out onto a slab, to be 
stamped out in fancy shapes, spear heads, leaves, 
stars, crescents, etc. 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



To mix with these there may be also fancy shapes 
cut from slices of raw beets, carrots and turnips, or 
some kinds of pickles, such as mangoes at d large 
peppers, all well freed f.om moisture. The patterns 
have to be graded in si/e to correspond with the 
different sized moulds 

Set each mould in a pan of broken ice, water and 
salt. Pour in some melted jelly and on the jelly as 
it coats the sides cnstruct the pattern desired, and 
when well set pour over another coat of jelly to se- 
cure it in its place. Finish perfectly even with the 
tops of the moulds with a bold pattern of spades or 
spear heads in close order, cut from some firm mate- 
ria\ to add strength to the foundation edge. 

When the decoration is completed and well set 
place the boned fowls inside and fill the moulds 
around them with clear jelly so nearly cold as not to 
endanger melting the patterns from the sides. 

Observe that the boned fowls must be cut deep 
enough to rest on the bottom of the mould and 
reach quite even with the top, as the jelly will not 
bear any pressure and the blocks of meat must rest 
upon each other when built up. 

, After building up these decorated galantines on a 
dish on a raised stand (sur socle) ornament with 
blocks and mou' dings of aspic jelly, and, perhaps, 
if they be not regarded cut of fashion, with orna- 
mental silver skewers passed through wreaths of 
wax flowers. 



'* It is csmaaome which constitutes the real merit 
of good soups, gives meat its reddish ticge, forms 
the crisp brown on roasts, and which yields a flivor 
to venison and game. This explains, by the way,

preferred the inner thigh ; his taste had instinctive- 
ly anticipated science."

The leg of the leveret is good for those that have the 
gout.' " 

— French Classic. 



T85. 

Galantine Stuflang— Another "Way. 



There is, to say the least, nothing better or more 
satisfactory of its kind than this. For one medium 
turkey — enough sliced for 25 plates — make 3 pounds 
of forcemeat of another turkey or of chicken as fol- 
lows: 



2 full grown fowls boiled tender. 

6 ounces of fat ealt pork. 

6 ounces of butter. 

6 ounces of white bread crumbs. 

2 raw eggs. 

8 hard-boiled eggs. 

^ pint of broth or stock. 

1 lemon. 

Salt and pepper. 

Take the dark meat of the fowls, cut it in very 
small dice and keep it separate. Take off the white 
meat, chop fine and then pound it to a sort of paste. 
Throw in the fat pork minced, the feaspoonful of 
pepper and salt and the bread crumbs and mix to- 
gether, and soften the butter and stir in. Mix the 
two raw eggs with the cup of broth and add the 
juice of the lemon, and with this mixture moisten 
the forcemeat. It is now ready for use. 

Lay the boned turkey out flat and partly slice 
some of the meat from the thick parts and lap them 
over the thin, that the galantine may make even - 
appearing slioes and not seem in some parts all 
stuffing. Season with a teaspoonful of aromatic or 
spiced salt, if you keep that preparation on hand, 
otherwise dredge with pepper and salt ; then strew 
over the turkey about half the dark meat mince, ana 
over that spread half the white forcemeat. Take 
the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs, cut them in 
quarters and scatter some over the forcemeat, then 
the rest of theminced dark meat, then the remain- 
ing forcemeat and egg yolks. 

Bring up the two edges of the boned turkey over 
this stuffing and sew it securely. Then wrap, boil 
3 hours, and press it as already detailed for galan- 
tines. 

If you use truffles or fresh grown mushrooms (not 
canned) they come in place in the white chicken 
forcemeat above instead of the egg yolks. The 
whites of the eggs look very well in all these galan- 
tines and may sometimes be added for variation. 



'786. Sliced Galantine in Aspic 



Coat the sides of any sort of handsome mould — a 
fluted cake moulder jelly mould is as good as any — 
with clear jelly, according to the extended direc- 
tions for a pyramid already given ; line it with 
handsome slices of turkey or chicken galantine, on© 
slice slightly overlapping the other ; in the center 
drop a piece of the galantine not sliced, or a boned 
bird, fill up with jelly, and when perfectly cold and 
set turn it out onto its dish and decorate for the 
table.

White Galantine. 

CHICKEN A LA BELLEVUB. 

Fill a boned turkey or chicken with white chicken 
forcemeat of the kind last directed for turkey. If 
wished to be thoroughly white substitute for the egg 
yolks and dark meat some of the whites of eggs 
minced, add a f^w blanched almonds and pistachio 
nuts, a pinch of ground mace, white pepper and 
the juice of another lemon. Do the galantine up in 
roundish or cushion shape, and press after boiling 
between two dishes. 

To coat it over for ornament make three pints of 
white jelly, with thin cream and two ounces of 
gelatine, precisely like blanc-mange, but seasoned 
with salt and a handful of parsley scalded in it in- 
stead of sugar. The cream will curdle if allowed to 
quite boil with the gelatine in it. Strain the white 
jelly, stir it in a pan set in ice-water, and when it 
is just about to set pour it evenly over the galantine, 
which should be in the refridgerator and very cold. 

While it is setting firm prcp^^re a sheet of white 
of egg custard as directed for the pyramid of boned 
turkeys, and s amp out a number of lenf and flower 
shapes. Lift the galantine on to its dish and 
decorate the smoath white surface and also the 
edge of the dish. A cord of the white jelly 
chopped and forced through a lady finger tube may 
be placed as a border on the dish to carry a wreath 
of artificial leaves, etc.

Spiced Salt for Turkey and Chicken. 



Tike half an ounce each of the following — they 
can generally be bought ready ground, but if not, 
must be dried, pounded and sifted : 

Nutmegs. 

Hace. 

Thym*?. 

Marjoram. 

Basil — and one ounce each of 

Cloves. 

Pepper — and a quarter ounce of 

Bay leaves — and mix them with 

4 pounds of fine salt. 



It is not recommended to persons making a galan- 
tine only occasionally to esperiment with spice 
flavors, which after ail may not be appreciated as 
well as the natural flavor of the fowl, yet where 
such cold dishes appear constantly and where 
everything is highly seasoned tjje spices become as 



necessary to the cook as the common sausage season- 
ings to the butcher. The following is the French 
pork-butcher's compound :

Aromatic Salt for Boned Goose, Boar's 
Head, Etc. 



Take half an ounce each of the following— all 
ground and sifted : 



Thyme. 

Marjoram. 

Mace. 

Cloves. 

Nutmegs. 

Bay leaves — and a quarter ounce of 

Rosemary — and one ounce of 

White pepper — and mix with 

4 pounds of fine salt. 

The diflference of the two mixtures is in the sage 
and rosemary. The latter is very aromatic with a 
taste like a mixtr.re of sage and pine leaves It 
seems to have been a great favorite and had many 
uses in olden times. "Nay, the boar hath rosemaries

701. Galantine of Goose or Duck. 



For the filling of one large goose take : 

2 ducks or fowls boiled tender. 
12 ounces of white bread crumbs. 

1 small onion. 

4 hard boiled eggs. 

3 raw eggs. 

^ cupful of melted goose fat. 
1 cupful of meat jelly or aspic. 

4 or 5 teaspoonfuls of the aromatic salt, or, pep- 
per, salt and sage. 

Strip the meat from the ducks or chickens when 
co:d — there should be 1 J p^^unds of it — cut it in very 
small dice as if for salad, likewise the boiled eggs 
and onion and bread crumbs. Mix alf, moisten 
with the raw eggs and g ose fat or butter. Fill the 
boned goose, or two or three ducks with the force- 
meat, strew the jelly over, and proceed as for turkey 
galantines. The jelly remains in the galantines 
and sets richly amongst the forcemeat.

cold, and savory. Pork sausage "^ith some bread

"Soon af er our walk over the farm, we sat down 
to a table, which was abundantly supplied. There 
was a euperb joint of corned beef, a stewed goose, 
and a magjificeut haunch of mutton, with vegeta-

huge jugs of excellent cider, of which I never tired

It is nothing, or next to nothing, to make a salade 
a la Russe or Muscovite or to put up a galantine de 
perdreaux a la royale. Suppose not many can, not 
many want them and it comes out even. But there 
are some things that all hotel and eating-house 
keepers must do or have done right that are quite 
difficult — gelting the management of that heaviest 
item, the butcher meats, down to a fine point, for 
instance. The trying time of the man of the "back 
part of the house" does not come of the fine dishes, 
the uncommon things, the fresh delicacies which 
money will procure in the markets ; the grand 
difficulty which so few can steadily face and over- 
come is made up of a lot of small ones too ridiculous 
almost to specify — the difficulty of getting the coffee 
made always alike and sent in always hot and yet 
not spoiled by boiling ; of making somebody attend 
to their du'y of keeping warm cups and pla es ; of 
getting cooks to make delicate fried mush and con- 
scientious oatmeal porridge and clean-looking fresh 
fried potatoes. 

. We try to keep to a rule in these writings of not un- 
derrating or passing by as useless anything that we 
have not tried, sifted, proved, weighed and 
measured and arrived at the worth of, and in that 
way earn the right to repeat again and again, there 
are needed fifty thousand cooks (or call them what 
you will) who will take interest enough to make the 
common unconsidered trifles well, for every one 
that is wanted to mQ,\Q pieces monties and monstrosi- 
ties in wax and tallow. 

The sort of cooks to cultivate, who are always 
wanted and for whom a little more wages than the 
ordinary is no objection with hotel keepers are those 
who will fry egg'? clean, white and appetizing, not 
black and smoked at the edges ; who can make 
batter-cakes as good without eggs as the common 
run can with half a dollar' s worth mixed in ; who 
can make common rolls so good they can not be 
surpassed and take pride enough to rise half an 
hour earlier to do so ,• cooks who will bake pies well 



done on the bottom. And what profit is it to the 
hotel-keeper to have in the larder &jambon a la 
gelee a la Francaise, which the guests m^y or may 
not recognize and may or may not be afraid to call 
for, if the corned beef is put on to cook only an 
hour or two before dishing-up time, is tough and 
rejected for dinner, sliced, rejected and thrown 
away after supper ? 

Thf se minor obstacles to a perfect table are nevei' 
quite overcome, but when I hear a hotel uncom - 
moj.ly well spoken of in this respect I am certain 
that a large measure of success has been attained, 
and I wonder then if there is not some one in the 
back part of that house looking thin-faced and 
tired ? 

703. Corned Beef Brine. 



6 gallons of water (about 3 pailfuls.) 

6 or 8 ounces of saltpetre — the large crystals kind. 

1 pint of molasses or sugar. 
10 pounds of salt. 

Set the water on the range in a boiler with the 
saltpetre in it to dissolve first, because sometimes 
when the brine is so strong with salt as to be what 
is called a saturated solution the saltpetre cannot 
melt in it but remains inoperative at the bottom. 
Then put in the molasses and the salt, let come to a 
boil and skim it. Pour into a clean ten-gallon keg. 

Two kegs of such brine are necessary to have for 
beef alone. It will keep good one or two months 
according to weather, but depending on how it is 
used. One is for dropping the course pieces of beef 
in from day to day as they are culled from the 
roasts and loins, the other is to change them over to 
when half corned and to use out of. But tongues 
and pork if pickled in the same kegs with the beef 
will spoil the brine very quickly. There ought to 
be other and smaller vessels of brine to receive 
them. 

703. 

Corned beef is an American "stand-by," a per-- 
manent favorite, and too much care can not be taken 
to have it good. People tire of fish, of poultry, 
game and ham, but not of roast beef nor corned 
beef, but whenever the hotel has to sell off its 
corned beef to get rid of it at a nominal price and 
buy the canned corned beef of the packing hous€8 
because it is better it is tolerably certain there is a 
screw loose, and somebody is remiss in their duty ot 
lacking in skill and attention. 

The packing house corned beef is good because it 
is made with good brine like that of the foregoing 
receipt, and because it is cooked almost to the soft- 
ness of jelly. It is too soft however to be used hot. 
It generally has just the right pink color, neither too 
red like raw meat nor too colorless like boiled fresh 
beef, to make it look attractive on the table ; this 
exact point can always be maintained by forethought

and regard to the temperature of the brine. Six 
ouQces of saltpetre will mike the beef as red if kept 
at summer heat as eight ouuces or more in cold 
weather. It takes about a week to corn beef suf- 
ficiently to begin using it. 

T94. 

l*reparing the Beef for Ooming. 



Nothing that is done for meat gives a better re- 
tarn for the time expended than attention to this 
point. 

When you have sawn oflF the brisket ends of the 
rib roasts and taken off the skirt or flank from the 
long loins take out the bones — you need them in the 
stock- boiler — and roll up the boneless meat to about 
the size of a wrist in diameter and of any convenient 
lengths, and bind these rolls tightly with cotton 
twine. They are generally finely streaked with 
lean and fat and when corned right color will slice 
cold into the very handsomest dishes of cold meat 
that can be set on a table, and are equally good in 
their way for hot corned beef on cabbage. 

If time allows it is best to shave the thick outer 
skin from such pieces of beef before rolling. Some 
lean and tough pieces such as come from the outside 
cut of the round, from the shoulder and neck can 
be cut in thick steaks, quite large, thin steaks of 
fat from some other pirt laid on and both roiled up 
together, these as well as fragmentary pieces are 
best used in the form of pressed corned beef. Throw 
the pieces when prepared into the brine, place a 
barrel head or board on top and a large stone to 
keep the beef under. Cover the keg with a cloth to 
keep flies out and keep in a cold place. 

Hundreds and thousands of pounds of meat are 
spoiled in hotels and thrown away for want of de- 
cision in those who have to manage it, or, perhaps, 
for want of definite knowledge of what use each 
particular portion mu-t be put to sooner or later. 
The choicest close-trimmed joints of meat that can 
be purchased have some portion that is tough and 
hardly eatable with the ordinary five-minutes 
cooking, but even the worst can be made tender if 
cooked long enough in some suitable way — hence 
the use of more ways than one in cookery, braising, 
stewing, potting, smothering, etc. 

It is the expedient of ignorance and inefficiency 
to get the rough and tough off their hands by send- 
ing it to table as roast or steak, (we are speaking of 
good hotel tables, of course), it is gone, to be sure, 
but will mostly be wasted just the same and some- 
body dissatisfied will eat something else. It is 
useless to hang a poor piece of beef on a hook ''for 
the present" hoping in some indistinct way that 
something will turn up so that you will want just 
such a piece of meat as that. The meat you hesitate 
about in warm weather is lost. It is the cook's 
business to know exactly what use every ounce can 
be put to. 



The minute the meat comes from the butcher's, if 
possible, the portions that must be either salted or 
thrown away sooner or later should be taken off and 
put in the brine barrel, and if that can be kept in 
the ice house there need not be a pound lost even in 
the hottest season 



T95. Boiling Corned Beef. 



Make it a rule of the day's work, which very 
soon will become a habit, to set on the salt meat 
boiler the first thing in the morning — say, at 6 
o'clock — and put in the corned beef at once. Fresh 
meats with all their juices in them should be 
dropped into boiling water, which immediately 
cooking the outside prevents them from ooxiog out 
into the water, but it is different with salt meats ; 
they have had their moisture withdrawn by the brine 
and are c mparaively dry and should be dropped 
into cold water in the boiler. It is supposed the 
salt in them draws in the water till it reaches cook- 
ing heat and closes the outside. Corned beef treat- 
ed so cuts moist and full of juices. 

Make it a rule that corned beef shall boil 5 hours. 
Any late pieces or top pieces not thoroughly c ^oked 
should be allowed to continue boiling during din- 
ner, for corned beef recof^ked next day to make it 
tenderer is never worth much — looks washed out 
and is flavorless. 



796. • 

Of all the beef bought for hotel tables only a 
third of the original weight arrives at the point of 
readiaess to place on the guest's plate ; only a 
fourth of the oiiginal weight actually reaches the 
table; probably only half of that, or one eighth of the 
raw weight is actually eaten ; so that for one hun- 
dred pounds of beef that really becomes sustenance 
to the hotel boarder eight hundred pounds of raw 
beef must be purchased. 

One-third of the raw weight is bone ; one-third 
more is fat, skin, gristle, suet, discolorations, blood 
stains, roughness and some scraps wasted in cutting; 
the remaining one-third is clear meat in steaks and 
trimmed roasts. 

This one-third of clear meat loses at least a 
quarter of its weight in cooking, and if fat will lose 
a third, or even half. Of roast beef on the carving 
stand, after all these preceding losses, there is lost 
probably a fourth of the weight it has on leaving 
the fire. This weight is lost through bad carving, 
neglecting to clean the bones, gouging out choicer 
cuts for pet people and wasting much more, and 
through the floW of gravy and drying out by the 
heat, and finally by what is left over of the roasts 
not large enough or good enough to be used again. 
A pair of chickens that weigh 4^ pounds in market 
will yield only IJ pounds of nett meat after cooking. 
A 14 pound turkey raw, with enough stuffing, pork, 
eggs, etc., to make up a total of 20 pounda original

weight will only turn out a 10 pound galantine after 
cooking. 

If the beef costs only 8 cents per pound by the 
entire carcass, that which the hotel-keepers buy and 
the waiters carry in to the guests on the individual 
dishes will have cost in the neighborhood of 75 cents 
per pound, and what is actually eaten by the guest 
will have cost somebody about a dollar a pound, 
for some is left on the dishes entire and much more 
pulled about on the plates, culled over, hacked and 
left. It is true there is one oflFset to all this — how- 
ever much more a hungry laboring man with only 
one dish might eat, the amount of any one kind of 
meat consumed by hotel boarders does not in an 
average way exceed two ounces for each person. 
But the proportion of waste is only the more enor- 
mous for that fact. 



It would require a volume to discuss the matters 
just specified in all their bearings, but whosever 
business it may be it is not ours; we have enough 
to do with our cooking. It is amon^the purposes 
and expedients of high intelligent cookery to lessen 
some of the great washes of the raw material and 
lead people away from clamoring for the very con- 
densed essence of all that is dear and train their 
taste to the appreciation of made dishes that are 
more the products of skill than of cost, to the end 
that the price of living may be cheapened, and two 
persons may live well where one would starve at 
the present rate of reckless prodigality. It is ac- 
cepted as a truth, while nobody understands, that 
French cookery is essentially economical, and yet 
those who think they try it never find it so, but 
quite the contrary. It is those who are supposed 
to practice it that are the wasters. 

The art and science is as high and worthy as any 
other, but the supposed followers are degenerate 
and unworthy. 

Good cookery — call it French or what you will — 
consists, for example, in taking the bones that 
constitute one-third of the weight of the beef as the 
hotel man buys it, and extracting all they will 
yield by boiling to make rich soups, and not only 
soups but stock to use in place of water to make a 
hundred common articles savory and nutritious, 
and in cooking the so-called rough pieces so well 
that they will be in greater demand than even the 
"choice cuts" of beef. 



•yoi. 



Pressed Corned Beef. 



There is some advantage in merely pressing the 
large pieces after boiling, as it makes them firmer 
to slice, and some never go any farther. The 
streaked rolls may be laid side by side and pressed 
to square or oval form. But pressed corned beef is 
generally expected to be something different from 
that. 



After boiling the beef 5 hours take it from th« 
liquor, cut in pieces about as large as eggs and sim- 
mer it about 2 hours more, using for this second 
boiling some fresh soup stock or chicken broth, just 
enough to fairly cover it, and rich enough to bejel^,» 
when cold. Season with a little pepper. 

Turn it out into the pan, tin pail or mould it is te 
be pressed in, the liquor with it, push a strainer 
down into it and take oflf the fat that rises in the 
strainer. Place a plate or lid and a weight on t6> 
and set in a cold place. 

It is not best to drain pressed corned beef of the 
jelly completely. In making the finest and costliest 
pates de cailles, or of foies gras with trufiles, trouble 
is taken when the baking is about finished to in- 
troduce aspic jelly through an aperture left in the 
top for the purpose and pressed beef need not be 
made dryer and harder because it is a cheaper ar- 
ticle. Let the jelly be firm enough not to become 
soft on the table. 

T98. Pressed Beef in Aspic Jelly. 



1. Cut the handsomest streaked rolls of cooked 
corned beef in slices, lay them on large platters, 
pour over enough clear melted aspic jelly to cover. 
When cold and set cut out the slices of beef and 
jelly with a tin cutter, place on the dish they are 
to be served in and garnish with parsley, pickles 
and beets. 

2. Cut the cooked corned beef into dice quite 
small, simmer^for an.hour or two more in broth or 
sfock strong enough to become jelly when cold. 
Then dip the meat into bright gem pans of some or- 
namental shape, in which you have first strewn 
some leavea of parsley. Set away to get cold, 
without pressure. When set firm take these in- 
dividual pains de boBuf from the moulds. Put at the 
bottom of each mould a slice of a pickle stamped in 
star shape and then return the cakes of beef to their 
places. Pour jelly in the thin space between the 
meat and the mould. Dish bottom side up and 
decorate. 



•«Cut and come again," it seems, has always been 
the motto of the English and Irish hunting squires 
when setting their boiled rounds of beef on the table 
— a free lunch for everybody. 

TOO. Cold Boiled Round of Beef. 



Corn a whole round of beef in the corned beef 
brine, letting it remain from 10 to 14 days. Wash 
it, take out the bone from the center Out S'^me 
strips of unsmoked fat bacon as thick as a little 
finger and lard the beef with them, maVing incisions 
with a carving knife and drawing in the strips with 
a looped string attached to a long skewer. For the 



214 



THE AMERICAN COOK. 



cavitj in the middle whence the bone was taken 
roll up a th'n slice of fat inclosing some chopped 
and seasoned beef. Roll the round up tightly in a 
cloth — such as a clean flour sack — and sew it. Boil 
about 7 hours. 

Pre»8 it when done, without removing the cloth it 
is wrapped in, into good shape, either between two 
sections of a sugar trough, two chopping bowls, a 
dairymaid's pail or an old oaken bucket. When 
cold remove the cloth, trim and place on a large 
cfish. 



It is just^necessary to mention that the larding 
with frtt bacon is not essential, but is only an im- 
provement for the tough side of the round, and to 
the general appearance ; and that such beef rounds 
have been boiled in home-brewed ale. 



800. Cold Spiced Round of Beef. 



The same in general as the preceding but the meat 
first pickled in a spiced brine. 



801. Pickle for Spiced Beef. 

3 gallons of water, 
3 ounces of saltpetre. 

3 pounds of salt. 

8 ounces of brown sugar. 

4 ounces of bruised black pepper corns, 

4 ounces of mixed spices — allspice, cloves and 
mace. 

8 bay leaves. 

Tie the spices, pepper an^ bay leaves loosely in a 
cotton cloth and throw them into the ten-gallon keg. 
Make the brine as directed for corned beef and pour 
it hot upon the spices. 

The addition of half a head of girlie, or an ounce 
of coriander seeds, or one or two onions, or 
aromatic garden herbs can be made to the spiced 
pickle above at option. Hotel cooking is the cos- 
mopolitan occupation and what may be offensive to 
one set of people often changes to the one thing 
most essential for another. The coriander seed ad- 
dition is, however, generally acceptable. 



Spiced sheep's tongues, calves' and pigs* feet and 
other c fid meats can be pickled as well as beef in 
the spiced brine — a method much surer, safer and 
better for the U9ual haste of hotel work than dry 
salting or pickling, which requires daily attention, 
turning and rubbing — and doesn't get it? 

801a. Cold Spiced Beef Rolls. 



Lay the solid lean pieces of the round of beef 
open in steaks, and on top of them lay thin sheets 
of fat salt pork. Roll up, tie, and keep in the spiced 
pickle two weeks. 



When to be cooked open the rolls, wash in cold 
water, spread over with parsley leaves plentifully, 
roll up again and tie. Place them in a saucepan 
and half fill with good soup stocK. Cover to keep 
the steam in either with buttered paper and the lid 
or with a lid of flour-and-water paste and keep the 
rolls stewiog about 5 hours. Cool in the same 
liquor ; press like corned beef; slice cold. 



By way of excuse for frequent quotations from 
Sir Edward Bulwer Ly^tou's first novel, Pelham, we 
will laisser nos moutons long enough to remark that 
the Lord Guloseton of that novel is none other than 
Brillat-Savarin, author ^Gmtronomy and Gastron- 
omers^ and almost the only writer of note on the 
subject, as the young and enthusiastic author 
imagined him after reading his book in the French. 
In his last novel, the Parisians, Lord Lytton re- 
turned to his early impressions and introduced a 
character named Savarin 

"And thou most beautiful of all, thou evening 
star of entremets — thou that delightest in truffles and 
gloriest in the dark cloud of sauces — exquisite /o«e- 
gras I — Have I forgotten thee ? What though the 
goose, of which thou art a part, has, indeed, been 
roasted by a slow fire, in order to increase thy di- 
vine proportions — yet has not our Almanach — the 
Almanach des Gourmands — truly declared that the 
goose rejoiced amid all her tortures — because of the 
glory that awaited her ? 0, exalted among birds — 
apothe sied goose, did not thy heart exult even 
when thy liver parched and swelled within thee, from 
that most agonizing death ; and didst thou not, like 
the Indian at the stake, triumph in the very tor- 
ments which alone could render thee illustrious V* 

— Pelham. 

That settles it. We don't want any preternatur- 
ally enlarged fat livers of geese if they have to be 
obtained in that way. 



In the countries where truffles grow and these ab- 
normal fat livers are produced the pates or raised 
pies are made with about three livers partly split 
like pouches, and truffles cut in pieces stuffed into 
the cavities. The crust is of hot-water paste raised 
in a mould. The inside of the raised crust is first 
lined with a forcemeat m«ide of chicken meat, bread 
crumbs, fat pork and herb seasonings, pounded and 
forced through a seive. The livers are laid in, 
truffles strewn in fragments over them, fat pork and 
forcemeat over that and a top crust over all. The 
pie is baked over two hours, enveloped in buttered 
paper. When nearly done it is withdrawn from the 
oven and some cognac brandy poured in. It is re- 
turned to the oven, and when done is filled up with 
aspic jelly mixed with madeira wine. The pie is 
elaborately ornamented with patterns in paste, and 
the dish with jelly.

Of the truffles used it is said : If a vendor with a 
basketful passes through the house in the morning 
a stranger coming in in the afternoon, hours after- 
wards, is instantly made aware of it by the perfume 
left behind.

803. Fat Liver Cheese in Jelly. 

PAIN DE FOIES DE POULAEDES. 

1^ pounds of chicken livers. 

1 pound of calf 8 liver. 

The meat of one chicken, previously cooked. 
IJ pounds of dry fat salt pork. 

4 ounces of bread steeped and squeezed dry. 

1 corned tongue cooked. 

8 ounces of the brisket fat of corned beef. 

2 cans of truffles, or, 1 pound fresh mushrooms. 
6 raw yolks of eggs. 

J pint of madeira or sherry. 

Spiced salt for seasoning. 

Examine the livers for gall stains, which make 
vhem bitter. Steep them all night in cold water. 
Melt the fat pork in a large saucepan, add all the 
livers cut small and the chicken meat likewise. 
Cook a short time, only till the livers seem to be 
cooked through without letting them become hard. 
If you have no spiced salt add a bayleaf, pepper, 
thyme and a pinch of spices in the saucepan to cook 
with the livers. Pound to a paste. Mix the bread 
panada and raw yolks together and the wine with 
them, add this mixture to the liver paste and press 
it all through a seive. Cut the brisket fat (already 
well cooked and cold) into dice shapes, also the red 
tongue and the truffles or mushrooms, and mix them 
in the paste. 

Bake the mixture in a mould for about 2 hours, 
but before putting it in the mould cover the bottom 
with thin slices of fit pork and hy some more and 
one bayleaf over the top of the liver cake. Set the 
mould in a pan of water and bake it that way. 

When done let it get quite cold in the mould. 
Dip in hot water to take it out. Remove all the fat, 
smooth it over with a hot knife. Cover with jelly or 
other\;ise ornament as for galantines and pressed 
beef. 

In place of the brisket fat above specified French 
cooks use calf s udder salted and boiled. 



Fre?h gathered large mushrooms, chocolate brown 
on the under side, yield a rich gravy and a higher 
flivor than the button mushrooms, and make a 
much better substitute for truffles. 
803a. 



Chicken Liver Paste or Liver Cheese. 



1^ pounds of poultry livers. 

12 ounces of fat ham or salt pork. 

4 ounces of lean cooked ham. 

1 email cup of sherry. 

1 bayleaf, pepper, little spice and salt. 



12 ounces of bread panada (French rolls soaked in 
milk and then squeezed dry in a cloth.) 

4 raw eggs. 

8 hard boiled yolks. 

1 cooked corned tongue. 

Some chopped mushrooms. 

Aspic jelly to garnish with. 

Steep the poultry livers — any kind — in cold water 
to whiten them. Set all the ingredients of the first 
part to simmer in a saucepan with the lid on at the 
back part of the range, and let remain till a con- 
venient time, or two or three hours. Then mash to 
a paste. Thejivers, etc., should be nearly dry in 
the saucepan but not at all fried or browned. 

Mix the raw eggs with the panada and these with 
the pounded liver. Press through a seive. Cut up 
the red tongue, the hard boiled yolks and mush- 
ro<^m8 if you have them and mix these in the paste. 
Bake about an hour with thin slices of fat pork first 
laid in the bottom of the pan or mould, and aiso on 
top of the liver cake and a buttered paper over that, 
and the mould set in a shallow pan of water in the 
oven. 

The paste as made above can be taken from the 
pan or mould, freed from fat and decorated like 
boned fowls. 

For individual dishes form it in egg shapes in 
this way: 

Chop some aspic jelly and have it ready. Make 
two tablespoons hot in a saucepan of water and scoop 
out spoonfuls of the liver paste, using the spoons 
alternately. While the egg shapes are still moist 
on the outside sprinkle them over with the jelly, or 
roll them in it. 

**He who can afford every day a dinner sufficient 

for a hundred persons, is often satisfied by eating 

the thigh of a chicken."

Italy. I should think a fowl is worth about twelve 

sous at Rome."

8€SSb. Galantines of Quails. 



First prepare the godiveau or forcemeat to fill out 
the thin parts of the quails : 

12 ounces of pork tenderloins. 

12 ounces of cooked chicken meat. 

20 ounces of fresh fat pork. 

Pound them smooth, the chicken first, the tender- 
loin added and then the fat. Season with spiced 
salt and rub the paste through a seive. 

Then prepare these for filling, all cut in small 
dice: 

1 cooked red corned tongue. 

1 pound of chicken livers — parboiled. 
12 ounces of cooked fat bacon. 
12 ounces of cooked ham. 

2, 3, or 4 cans of truflaes— or, some mushrooms. 

Salt, spices, madeira wine or sherry. 

Bacon slices to wrap the birds in. 

Some meat glaze. 

Flour-and-water paste. 

When you have cut the tongue, livers, bacon fat, 
ham and truffles in small dice season them either 
with spiced salt or with pepper and spices equiva- 
lent, and then stir in half a cup of wine. 

Bone two dozen quails, wipe them dry and clean ; 
pare some meat from the breasts and lay it over the 
thin places ; spread over them a little of the force- 
meat paste, over that a layer of the dice -cut mix- 
ture, and then fold up the quails to their original 
shape. Instead of sewing roll e^ch bird in a thin 
slice of unsmoked bacon or dry salt pork. These 
are now to be coobed separately and this is best 
done in deep muffin pans or gem pans of granite- 
ware — either round or oval will do but they must 
be large enough to hold gravy above the quails, and 
in nests of ten or twelve fastened together the 
usual way. Press the galantines into the pans, 
pour over a little melted fresh butter mixed with 
meat glaze (natural meat gravy simmered down 
thick), cover each one with a crust of flour-and- 
water paste, bake in a moderate oven about an hour, 
the gem pans or moulds set In a baking p in con- 
taining boiling water. — They must not brown nor 
fry. 

When done take off the paste covers and let the 
quails cool a little, then press them by setting one 



nest of pans or moulds on top of the other and 
weights on top of all. When quite cold take the 
galantines from the moulds, remove the covering of 
bacon, trim them and use in the ways of the larger 
galantines, either to slice in jelly, built in a pyramid 
and decorated, or to surround a larger galantine. 

The greatest care is required in seasoning the 
above lest they come out too salt, the ham, tongue 
and bacon all being likely to contribute some. The 
butter used should be poured off clear, and fresh 
pork may be used for outside wrapping instead of 
salt, rather than risk anything. 



Somewhere, I think, the Count of Monte Christo 
has a splendid cold supper set in a wonderful cave, 
and there is a large fawl, perhaps it was a turkey, 
surrounded by Corsican blackbirds Liisely enough 
the heads of the blackbirds were set on again after 
the tiny galantines were cooked and ornamented. 
But it is not likely that the cook made a separate 
lot of fillings for the birds when he had just stuffed 
the turkey with another kind. He might have bad 
to do 80 had he been cooking for a houseful of 
boarders without appetiies, to whom nothing tastes 
good, but he had to serve only transients, just ar- 
riving and mostly delighted with all they meet with 
at the hotel table. The cook in that case used for 
the large galantine the same kind of forcemeat as 
that in our boned turkeys and chickens some dis- 
tance back, which is very good and not too arti- 
ficially flavored, and he took some of the same and 
added truffles cut small to it for the galantines of 
birds. When boning quails for a supper where 
there is no bill of fare to turn attention to them it is 
best to leave the legs on — boned half way and stuffed 
—to show what they are. 



80Sc.Boned Pig's Head in Jelly. 



The head should be corned in the same kind of, 
pickle as corned beef, but only lie in it 2 or 3 days. 

Bone the head before salting. It should be the 
head of a butcher's porker, not a fat bacon hog. 
Saw it in halves and cut the meat close to the bone. 
It is handier to slice made up in two halves than 
one whole head. You want besides : 

4 pounds of sausage meat from the butcher's. 

2 corned red tongues, or 4 if pigs' tongues. 

2 pounds of fat salt pork. 

Take the two halves of the head from the brine, 
wash in cold water, trim off any discolored portious, 
take off the ears — they can be thrown in the boiler 
separate — then laying the head skin downwards 
slice off some of the meat from the thick parts and 
lay over the thin. Spread some sausage meat over ; 
cut the tongues and fat pork in strips and lay them 
on the sausage crosswise of the head. Cover the 
strips with the rest of the sausage meat. 

Roll up the two halves tightly, beginning with 
the snout, which is to be in the middle of the roll, 
and the rolls to be of even thickness from one end

to the other and evenly mixed, the lean with the fat, 
80 as to slice all alike and no waste. Roll up in 
clean white pudding cloths, sew or tie securely. 
Boil from 4 to 6 hours in a boiler that will hold six 
gallons of water, and put in with the head some 
soup vegetables and sage, and pepper and salt. 

When done press them in shape like any other 
galantine ; there is no better shape than the long 
and narrow sinks of the steam chest. Some cheaper 
tins made like them should be kept on hand for such 
purposes. 

The liquor in which the head has boiled 6 hours 
will be a strong jelly when cold, without the addition 
of gelatine. 



The cloth wrapping for galantines and pig's heads 
that comes the nearest to absolute purity is a piece 
of well-worn white linen tablecloth such as the 
housekeeper generally can supply. The many 
bleachings it has had have freed it from the taste of 
new cloth. It should be washed in clear water and 
kept white and dry for such uses. 



Take off the grease and clarify thejellyinthe 
same way as directed for aspic, and then use it to 
coat the boned pigs' heads in their moulds by the 
same method as boned turkeys. 

They are adapted either to be set on the table 
whole or sliced with the jelly surrounding for in- 
dividual dishes — their chief merit being, they are 
always declared to be good eating. 



803cl. 



Head Cheese. 



Make it the same in a general way as pressed 
coropd beef, with a sage and pepper seasoning. 

Split the heads, bone them, singe, scrape and 
thoroughly cleanse them and let lie in corned beef 
pickle about 2 days. Boil 3 or 4 hours. Then cut 
up the meat, strain the liquor through a fine gravy 
strainer, put cut meat and liquor back in the boiler 
and simmer 2 hours more with the seasonings added, 
cool and press in moulds or bright milk pans. 2 
teaspoonfuls of pepper, 2 of ground sage and 2 of 
salt is the average seasoning needed for one head 
that is partly salted before cooking. 



'It is useless trying to make fat bacon heads "go" 
in these forms. Either take off all the fat for lard 
or else mix in a proportion of lean corned beef.

Sallust. 'It very nearly did,' returned Pansa, with

— Last Days of Pompeii, 



"The next trifle was a wild boar, which emelled 
divine. Why, then, did Margaret start away from 
it with two shrieks of dism ty, and pinch so good a 
friend as Gerard ? Because the duke's cuisinier 
had been too clever, had made this excellent dish 
too captivating to the sight as well as taste. He 
had restored to the animal, by elaborate mimicry 
wiih burnt sugar and other edible c lors, the hair 
and bristles he had robbed him of by fire and water. 
To make hitn still m )re enticing, the huge tusks 
were carefully preserved in the brute's jaw, and 
gave to his mouth the winning smile that comes of 
tusV: in man or beast : and two eyes of colored sugar 
glowed in his head. St. Argut I what eyes I so 
bright, so bloodshot, so threatening — they followed 
a man and every movement of his knife and spoon." 
— The Cloister and the Hearth. 

We have only to remark of the above ferocious 
monster that the tusks he showed were not his own, 
but were imitations made of tallow hardened with 
alum ; his mouth was made dreadful by being spread 
all over the inside with red butter colored either 
with beet juice or with lobster coral ; his savage grin 
was produced by propping up his lips, where the 
tusks protrude, while the head was warm after 
cooking, and letting it become very cold before 
taking the chips away, and his eyes were very 
likely of glass marbles, or the proper made glass 
eyes used by taxidermists ; as for the briatles, the 
skin was first brushed over several times with meat 
glaze and when that was quite dry the confectioner 
came with some melted sugar taffy and a brush made 
of iron wires and made sugar hairs stand up all over 
it and then barbered them to the right heigbtb. 
All the brains the boar bad in his head was some 
minced meat of a calf. 



80;3e. Pifir's Head Galantine. 



Take the head of a large butcher's porker cut off 
with a good part of the neck attached. Singe off 
any remaining hairs and trim it clean. Commence 
at the throat and bone it carefully, then put it in 
pickle for 3 or 4 days. Stuff it with sausage meat 
(or, any forcemeat used for boned turkeys wi 1 do) 
and strips of red tongue and fat bacon, and season 
with aromatic spiced salt. 

Form it in its natural shape, sew the cuts with 
cotton twine, roll up tightly in a cloth and boil 6 or 
6 hours in stock seasoned well with soup vegetables, 
salt, pepper and sage, and, if so required, with a 
bottle of white wine. But with the wine stock use 
thyme instead of sage. When done let it cool in the 
liquor till it can be bandied with ease, then take off 
the cloth and bind the head again with bands of 
cloth, drawing it into the shape it is to have when 
cold. 

Set the ears up, and if curled by boiling flatten 
them ^ith split pieces of wood. When quite cold

In the entire list of foreign royal menus, some 
four score in number, previously ics anced in these 
columns, only one has huitres aux citrons, or raw 
oysters at all, and this is at the ducal palace of 
Hesse Darmstadt, in 1868, and the oysters preceded 
the meal. 

However, the fashion cannot be very new, for 
they tell us the emperor Heliogabalus used to eat 
400 Brundusium Blue Points every morning, to give 
himself an appetite for his breakfast. 

According to a writer in Leslie s Monthly, speak- 
ing fjr New York, the rule which declares oysters 
good only ia the months spelled with ' r" is but 
li'tle regarded now, and the trade is becoming 
curiously systematized so that there is a different 
crop of oysters for different seasons and different 
purposes. The Prince's Bay's rule almost ex- 
clusively in the summer months, succeeded by 
Sounds and Mill Ponds. The winter months bring 
the Rockaways and East Rivers, and the Blue 
Points, most esteemed, predominate through the 
spring. There are long Saddle Roc ^s for roasts 
and broils ; East Rivers and Virginias for sJews, 
while for a raw dish the round, fat, large Blue 
Points and Shrewsburys are preferred. 



The effort at luxury now is to serve raw oysters 
in hollowed blocks of ice, and they might as well be 
in clear colored ices, sea green and ocean blue, 
frozen in form with shells and pebbles — much 
easier to freeze than sweet ices and mousses glacees.

can add a dish of rare crayfish from the Cray.' 

'Give me the trout and the capon,' replied 
Chaucer. 'And, hark ye, while you are preparing 
supper, bring me a flask of red Gascoigne wine and 
a manchet.' "

Cold Ham. 



It may be just necessary to mention that hams to 
be roasted or baked are on rare occasions steeped 
in wine with spices and herbs, and are entirely 
covered with a flour-and-v\ater paste and so baked. 
They are also after steeping (marinading) braised 
in covered iron saucepans, wiih seasoned soup stock 
and wine, and finished by baking brown. 

Put the ham in water slightly warm and let it 
soak • all night. Wash and set it on in cold water 
and boil 3 to 4 hours. Take it up, remove the skin 
and bake it in a moderate oven half an hour. Then 
withdraw it, cover with all the cracktr meal that 
can be m;ide to stick with pressure, and bake a few 
miuutes longer to brown the breading. Cracker 
meal is pounded and sifted crackers. Dried bread 
crumbs do as well, or raspings of bread. 



803h, To Glaze a Ham. 



Meat glaze may be defined as beef tea boiled 
down till it is as thick as syrup, and like gum when 
quite cold. It may be obtained in quantity by 
boi'ing down rich stock or stewed meat liquor. 

To glaze a ham, after baking it brown give it two 
or three coats with a brush dipped in gaze, drying 
it in a warm place after each application. 

Another way, useful when there is no glaze ready, 
is, after baking the ham brown, cover it with all 
the granulated sugar that caa be made to s ick to it 
with pressure of the hands. The ham shorld, 
however, be first freed as much as possible from 
grease by means ofa dry cloth. Put the sugar- 
coated ham back in the oven and watch it lill the 
sugar has become caramel brown all over alike. 



803i. 



Sandwiches. 



1. Two thin slices of buttered bread and a slice 
of cold roast turkey, peppered and salted, laid be- 
tween. Cut the slices in square form, thea across 
to make triangular sandwiches. Pile on a folded 
napkin. 

2. Melt a cupful of butter in a saucepan. Mince 
an equal quantity of cold boiied ham and add it to 
the butter. Put in for seasoning a tablespoonful of 
made mustard, pepper and a chopped pickle. 
Spread one slice of bread with this mixture, another 
with plain butter and lay a very thin slice of cold 
roast veal between. 

3. Spread slices of cold ham with a little mus- 
tard and lay between two slices of buttered bread. 

French rolls made flat for the purpose and 
shortened with butter, also well made flaky biscuits 
are preferable to sliced bread for sandwiches for 
ball suppers and outdoor parties, as they do not be- 
come dry eo quickly.

Ornamental Stands for Cold Dishes* 

Such articles as white galantines, jardiniere salad 
and whole fishes covered with miyonaise have to 
be raised on tall stands, or tbey make no show at 
all on a set (able, and an ornamental set-off is as 
valuable to a homely-looking dish as to some other 
homely things, A common glass cake stand can be 
80 coated with white wax, or parrafio, and so 
covered with whi'e wax flowers of a sort easily 
made, and artificial leaves, that it can never be 
recognized f r what, it is, and a white galantine 
seems very much at home on that sort of stand. 
But the better expedient ia to get a carpenter to 
make some stands of wood, something like glass 
cake stands, that is, consisting of a stem set ia a 
broad case, but of oval shapes, the top being a tray 
with a hoop-like rim to receive and hold the large 
meat platter. 

These cabinet-work stands being neatly made cf 
white wood and smooth, are next to be coated over 
with parrafin melted and applied with a brush, 
then smoothed by holding before the fire. 

There are moulds to be had, imported from Paris 
made of type metal and close fitting in which may 
be cast classical figures in white wax, sea-horses 
dragons and the Lke to be set around the base of 
your stands, ard heads and faces and birds for the 
euds of the platters. 

The making of the multitudinous roses is a very 



simple matter, and though they are not very life- 
like they answer the temporary purpose quite well. 
You take half a dozen carrots of different sizes and 
cut the ends as near as may be in the resemblance 
of flowers, dip them in melted parrafin or wax and 
then immediately into cold water. The thin waxen 
mask of a flower shape can then be pulled off and 
another made. These are of course easily set in 
clusters on the stands by means of melted wax, pbA 
white leaves such as cakes are ornamented with COBO^ 
plete the garlands. But all sorts .i mouldin?S» cpr» 
niees and borders can bQ Clad , on the sam« plpSif 
Instead of wax these stands can be covered with 
cake icing, white or colored, and with ornaments of 
gum paste. 



One thing more : There is a little patching to be 
done in our trade as well as others. It is difiicult 
to boil a fish so entire that it can be covered smooth- 
ly with a jelly and show no yawning chasms, and 
to have a boar's head without an ugly twist in the 
corner of his mouth. To smooth over the breaks in 
the fish, or to stuff it in natural form make a paste 
of whitefish pounded with half as much bread, a little 
butter, and yolks of eggs, and bake the fish a little 
while, covered with buttered paper. For the other 
case forcemeat will answer, glazed over.

802 k. Raised Pies. 

They are of two or more kinds, either raised by 
pressing a common paste info the shape of a dish, 
with the fingers, or made more ornamental with a 
richer paste in a tin mould. 

For the la'ter make the ordinary short paste the 
fame ?»s for covered pies or shortcake, of a pound 
cf lard to two pounds of flour and a little salt,mixed 
up j-lightly warm. Knead it compact and smooth 

Put a buttered sheet of paper on a baking pan, 
butter the mmld inside and set it on the p&per; put 
in a bottom crust half an inch thick and then line 
the sides, wet ing the lower edge and pressing it to 
join the bottom piece. 

, The pie may be filled with anything in the meat 
line that is good to eat cold; there may be a boned 
chicken prepared exactly as directed for galantine, 
and some boned quails placed around it, and have 
trufilea and mushrooms for seasonings and thin 
slices of fat unsmoked bacou on top. 

But to make it as fine as possible, the inside of 
the crust should be spread over with liver pas'e 
made as at No. 802, or preferably perhaps, with tine 



sausage meat, before the fowls are put in. 

Then put on the top crust, pinch the edges, trim 
neatly, roll the scraps of paste thin and stamp out 
leaf shapes enough to cover the top. Leave a hole 
in the middle. Bru h over with egg and water, tie 
greased paper outside the same as in baking a fruit 
cake; bake the pie in a slack oven three or four 
hour?. Open the mould a';d take it off when the 
pie is nearly cold, and as no liquor is baked in the 
pie, some gravy made by boiling the bones of the 
fowl down rich enough to be jelly when cold, must 
be poured in the cavity left in the lid. 

The renowned Perigord pie has the inside lined 
wi h slices of truffles set in liver paste sea oned with 
aromric salt, and the filling is of fat goose livers 
and truffles, bacon on top and aspic jelly mixed with 
Madeira wine poured in while the pie is cooling.

into the middle of the flour and stir up gradually. 
Work it stiff and smooth. 

Raised pies of all sizes made of the above kind of 
paste formed by hand, and covered with a top crust 
more or less ornamented by snipping with a pair of 
shears, are quite an Eog'ish institution; small pork 
pies, eel pies and others being the sole article of 
trade at some lunch hous s; whilst the larger and 
more elaborate forms are among the Christmas 
dishes of world-wide fame. 



802 m. Chicken or Turkey Sausage. 

Take the skin off a large fowl by first cutting 
down the back and cutting around the joints to the 
skin as nearly whole as possible. 

Cut all the meat of the fowl from the carcass with- 
out bone or gristle, chop it raw, like sausage meat, 
and then pound it with a masher in the chopping 
bowl. Weigh it, and take half as much fat bacon, 
chop and pound it likewise. Mix the two pastes 
together, season like sausage-meat with pepper.sage 
and salt. Roll up in the skin of the fowl and then 
in a napkin, and boil the sausage in seasoned broth, 
with the bones of the fowl in it, for an hour. When 
done put it on a dish to cool in the napkin it was 
boiled in, and another dish or other weight on top 
to give it an even shape. Slice cold and ornament 
with ielly and p srsley. 



802 n. Truflaed Chicken. 

1 fat pullet, and the breasts of 2 more. 

1 large can of truffles. 

J pound of fat salt pork. 

Seasonings. 
Bone the fowl according to directions at No. 779, 
and cut off the fiUe s or white meat of tho other two 
and lay them all side by side on the table. Cut the 
fat pork in thin strips, score gashes in thick parts of 
the chiclseu and lay the strips in, cut the truffles and 
dispose the pieces evenly where they will show the 
black spo's in the white meat when the chicken is 
sliced. Dredge well with salt and white pepper 
and a little nutmeg and powdered thyme. Then lay 
the chicken breasts in the thin places of the fowl, 
bring the two sides together and sew up the fowl 
into nearly its original shape. Do it up in a cloth, 
tie and pin it, and b il it two hours in salted broth. 
Press it while cooling. Take off the cloth when 
cold, draw out the thread it is sewed with. Serve 
the fowl either incased in aspicjelly, or coated with 
melted butter, or slice it and display the slices in a 
dish. 



place inside a half of a potted quail, prepared ac- 
cording to the following receipt. 



802i7. Potted Quail. 

1 dozen quail. 

1 pound of veal. 

1 pound of fat bacon. 

Seasonings and paste. 
Bone the birds as directed for boning fowls; a 
penknife may be used, and no great care is requir- 
ed, except to get all the meat and not tear the sides 
to tatters. Cut each in two. Chop the veal and 
bacon together into sausage meat, and season with 
a teaspoonful of mixed mace, cloves and white pep- 
per, and the same of salt, and a teaspoonful of finely 
mincfd lemon riud. 

Select a jar or two small ones that the quail may 
be kept in after cooking, spread a thin layer of the 
veal and bacon forcemeat on the bottom, lay the 
halves of quail in order on that, spread them with 
a little of the forcemeat and so on till all are in, hav- 
ing forcemeat for the top. Cover with a thin slice 
or two of bacon, then with a crust of flour and water 
paste and bake by setting the jar in a pan of water 
in the oven, for three hours. 

When done take off the crust and drain away the 
fat and gravy and press by placing a small plate 
inside on the meat and a weight on that. When 
cold cover with clarified butter and cover tightly to 
exclude the air. 

In case bacon is not liked in such pottings as the 
two preceding, fresh butter sufficient to cover and 
bake the meat or birds in can be used instead. 



802 0. Sandwiches of Potted Quail. 
Make rolls, either split or rounded, but flat, and 



802 g. Potted Rabbit. 

Potted meats will keep for months if required,and 
can be drawn upon as the occasion requires. 

2 small rabbits or 1 large one. 

1 pound of fat bacon. 1 pound of veal. 

The liver of the rabbits. 

Salt, pepper and spices. 
Cut the rabbit in pieces and put it in a stone jar; 
cut the veal and bacon in large dice, mix them and 
add a teaspoonful of mixed mace, cloves and black 
pepper, and a teaspoonful of salt, and fill the spaces 
between the pieces of rabbit. Lay a thin slice or 
two of bacon on top and 1 bay leaf, then cover with 
a lid of p^ain paste made of flour and water only, 
set the jar in a pan or pot containing water and 
bake in a slow oven 3 or 4 hours. There is no 
water needed in the meat. A greased paper on top 
will keep the paste from burning. 

When done,8et the jar away to become cold, pick 
the meat from the pieces of rabbit and pound them to 
a paste along with the veal, and bacon and fat, and if 
any gravy at the bottom, boil down almost dry and mix 
it in. Taste for seasoning. Press solid into small jars 
or cups, and cover the top with the clear part of 
melted butter. Keep tightly covered in a cool place.

FONDANT ICING OR CREAM FONDANT. 

Says Mr. H. G. Harris in the British and For- 
eign Confectioner, Baker and Restaurateur (Lon- 
don): "Why do pastry cooks all over the coun- 
try (he might have written < all over two coun- 
tries ') persist in using icing sugar beaten up with 
whites of eggs or gelatine for making pastry and 
small fancy cakes.? The dull, dead, opaque, and 
mostly rough surface obtained is always offensive 
to me, and, I think, must be so to any one accus- 
tomed to use fondant. The beautiful, bright, 
glistening, and semi-transparent fondant is still 
without a rival, and is withal so cheap, that I 
really do not understand why every confectioner 
in the country does not use it?" 

As far as concerns the great body of our hotel 
pastry cooks, one very sufficient reason for their 
not adopting the better plan is set forth in the 
next paragraph : 

" The utensils needed are a stove for boiling 
sugar — gas will do if you have a good volume of 
jets ; a good-sized copper stewpan ; a marble slab ; 
a set of polished i-inch iron bars for making the 
sides of ' well ' or • bay ' on the slab. A spattle 
like a small iron peelhead on the handle of a car- 
pet-stretcher; and a flat steel scraper, like those 
used by painters. Also a small earthen pan with 
a cover, to keep the fondant in when made, and 
say half a dozen small white metal French stew- 
pans for melting the fondant for use as needed." 

To the above list should be added a saccha. 
rometer — a small glass instrument (which costs 
about $2.50), graded to show the different degrees 
of boiling sugar. It is a fact, more or less un- 
fortunate, that but a very small proportion of 
hotels are so well furnished in their working de- 
partments as to possess these candy-making uten- 
sils, and the twenty thousand houses that are 
without such conveniences and yet employ pas- 
try cooks at very fair pay, will still perpetuate the 
ready and easy methods which require no fresh 
outlay for special tools. 

Every reader knows \i\\2X fondant (pronounced 
fondong) is, but not by that name, who has ever 
eaten the assorted fancy candies of the shops, and 
will now understand its usefulness and value : it 
is the white, soft candy that forms the inside of 
chocolate drops, and that is used in making wal- 
nut creams, fig creams and all those "bon-bons " 
which have a strip of candied fruit or nuts pressed 
into a cream candy base. It is fondant icing to 



spread over cakes when it is melted over the fire, 
and, perhaps, slightly diluted with syrup. As 
icing it cannot be used for piping, but is only for 
a glossy covering for cakes. The most concise 
and lucid directions for making it are the fol- 
lowing : 

CREAM FONDANT — NO. I. 

" I presume from your question that the cream 
you speak of is what we call fondaht, which ar- 
ticle is the basis of all cream bonbons. This fon- 
dant is also used for covering or icing cakes and 
a great variety of what is called dipped goods. 
Fondant is made by boiling simple syrup to the 
forty-fifth degree by the saccharometer ; then 
pouring it on a very clean marble slab between 
iron bars, and when it has become nearly cold, so 
that you can place the back of your hand upon it 
without its adhering to it; it must be worked to 
and fro with a long-handled spatula until it gran- 
ulates into a smooth mass, it must then with a 
knife be loosened from the marble and worked or 
broken with the hands into a softish mass, and 
placed into an earthenware pan and covered. 
When you want to use it for icing purposes place 
the required quantity in a round-bottomed pan, 
place it upon a slow fire, and stir constantly with 
a small wooden spatula until it is thoroughly 
melted, and there are no lumps in it. Do not on 
any account allow it to boil, even a little, as that 
would entirely destroy its creamy texture and 
change it into hard conserve ; when melted pour 
it over the article to be covered and use a pallet 
knife to smooth it and facilitate your operation, 
which must be done quickly, as in a few moments 
it will begin to set and dry. The cake can then 
be decorated with ordinary egg-icing, or in any 
other way to suit your fancy." 

CREAM FONDANT — NO. 2. 

Take say 14 lbs. of good loaf sugar, put in a 
stewpan with ly^ lb. liquid glucose, and 2 quarts 
water; allow it to stand some time to dissolve 
the sugar; the less water you can dissolve 
the sugar in, the less time will it need boiling, 
and consequently the better color your fondant 
will be, but all the crystals must be dissolved be- 
fore the syrup comes to the boil, or you are sure 
to have trouble arising from recry stall ization or 
graining ; whilst your syrup is boiling add a few 
drops only of acetic acid, boil to the soft ball, and 
then quickly pour on to a very clean marble slab 
previously well sprinkled w^ith water, and with

iron or steel bars placed so as to form a square or 
oblong space for the sugar. Sprinkle also a little 
cold water on the surface of the sugar : it will 
keep it from forming a hard surface and make it 
easier to work after; when nearlj cold lift up the 
iron bars, and with a scrape clean them, and also 
scrape the sugar all into the middle of the slab ; 
then with a flat iron or wooded spattle work it 
from the sides to the middle ; that is, with a push- 
ing motion collect the sugar from the outside of 
the mass and quicklj and continually turn it over 
on to the centre by a backward motion. 

This will take some little time, but by and by 
the sugar will begin to look white, and will con- 
tinue to do so, only more so, until after a little it 
will become quite opaque and hard ; then care, 
fully scrape it off the spattle and slab ; put away 
ready to use as may be required. 

CREAM FONDANT — NO. 3. 
(BY MR. E. G. HARRIS.) 

It will be best to try a small quantity first, un- 
til you get experience ; so we will start with, say, 
seven pounds broken loaf sugar (Say's loaf is 
best, but Tate's crushed is good, but must be 
sifted to remove all fine). Put the seven pounds 
sugar into the stewpan with one pound liquid 
glucose and about a pint and a half of water. Put 
the lid on and stand the stewpan on one side for 
an hour, by which time the sugar will be nearly 
dissolved. Now put on to the stove and bring 
up to the 6oil. Be careful that no lumps remain 
undissolved when the boiling point is reached. 
Keep the sides of the stewpan washed down by 
dipping the fingers of the right hand into cold 
water, and then with your fingers clearing off 
any sugar that may adhere to the stewpan. After 
well washing the sides down, and skimming off 
any dirt or scum that may rise to the surface, it is 
best to keep the cover on the stewpan for some 
little time, then the steam will be sure to keep the 
sides clean ; so place the cover that the bulk of 
the steam may escape, or it will condense and fall 
back into the sugar. Boil quickly as you can 
until the sugar reaches the ball. To try this, dip 
your fingers into a basin of cold water, then into 
the boiling sugar and back into the cold water 
carrying some sugar on your fingers ; and when 
you can roll up the soft and sticky mass on your 
fingers into the form of a ball or marble that will 
just, but only just, retain its shape, it is ready for 
your purpose. It is not needed to be boiled quite 
so high as the ball for fondant making, but I bring 
it back, slightly, later on, as I will show you. 

Before the sugar is quite finished boiling, have 
your slab well washed and dried, and ready to 
use ; and when the sugar is nearly boiled enough, 
rub a little cold water all over the slab and arrange 
♦Ue bars to form either a square or an oblong, so 



that the sugar, when poured on, shall be about 
half an inch thick. Now pour quickly on the 
slab, and sprinkle all at once over the surface a 
little cold water, until the heat of the sugar 
causes the water to vaporise, and steam ari«es. 
This will produce a wet surface all over the sugar, 
and prevent a thick skin forming, and also reduce 
the tendency to graining. My reason for boiling 
up to the ball was to enable me to put this little 
water on the boiled sugar, and thus bring it back 
to the pitch to which I wanted it. 

Do not scrape out the stewpan, because the 
sugar so scraped out will be slightly grained, and 
will cause the clear sugar on the slab to grain 
more or less if added to it. Therefore put a little 
water into the stewpan and place back on the 
stove, cover down with lid, and the result after a 
little boiling will be a clean stewpan and some 
clear surup which will be useful in many ways ; 
reducing the fondant to the proper thickness, 
etc., when being used. 

Do not touch the sugar on the slab until it is 
nearly cold, say about forty-five minutes after you 
put it there, but that must depend on temperature 
of the place, etc. (If the sugar is too cold, you 
will have great difficulty in beating it up, and if 
too hot, the graining will lake place too quickly, 
and the crystals be much too large. The re-crys- 
tallization should be so fine that grittiness or 
graining is not perceptible, but the mass should 
be beautifully white and creamy.) 

Now take away the iron bars and scrape them 
free from sugar; take the large spattle in hand 
and scrape the mass into the middle of the slab, 
and proceed to work it well by ever bringing the 
sides into the middle, with a long sweep at the 
side, collecting the sugar on the spattle, and then 
bring back the spattle over the top of the centre, 
reversing the spattle as you do so, and leaving 
the sugar so collected on the top each time. In 
a short time the sugar will begin to look milky, 
and, later on, creamy. And now, if you please, 
boss, put in all the work you are able for about 
ten minutes, and then you will see before you a 
mass of bright, white, creamy, rocky looking 
sugar, and If you break off a piece you will find 
it quite soft and short, and in your mouth, will 
melt quite readily and taste creamy. Scrape the 
slab quite clean, bringing all the small pieces to- 
gether, and press them into the main lump. Put 
altogether into the earthenware pan, and cover 
down closely ; it will then come back a little, and 
become a little softer. 



GENOISE CAKE. 

^ pound of sugar. 
3^ pound of butter. 
13 ^8S»' 



Q24 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY CXX>K. 



xX pound of flour. 

Small half-cup of milk. 

3 teaspoons of baking powder. 

Flavor with almond or yanilla. 

Cream the butter and sugar together same as for 
pound cake, add the eggs 2 at a time and beat in, 
then the milk and the flour with powder in it 

This cake is used in all sorts of wajs, either in 
moulds, or cut in squares, or spred in sheets, it 
is tougher but lighter than pound cake, and is 
cheaper in proportion to size of cakes. 



MADEIRA CAKE. 

I^ pound of flne granulated sugar. 

I pound of butter. 

16 eggs. 

l^ pound of flour. 

Flavor with lemon. 

Mix same as pound cake, hy stirring the butter 
and sugar together till white and creamy and 
then beating the eggs in, 2 at a time, and the 
flour last. 

Bake in muffin pans or patty pans with strips 
of citron on the top of each cake. A slight 
dredging of sugar on top of each cake before bak- 
ing makes them glaze and look richer. 

MADEIRA CAKE — RICHER. 

I pound of sugar. 
I pound of butter, 
12 eggs. 

I pound 2 ounces of flour. 
Lemon flavor. 
Citron strips to bake on top. 
Mix up same as pound cake and the Madeira 
cake of the previous recipe. 

VICTORIA CAKE. 

I pound of fine granulated sugar. 

16 eggs. 

}4 pound of butter. 

% pound of flour. 

Separate the whites from the yolks, beat the 
whites quite firm, add the sugar in portions and 
continue beating, making it the same as kiss 
meringue mixture; stir up the yolks, then mix 
them in, then the flour, and melt the butter and 
stir it in last. Bake in shallow moulds, like 
sponge cake, and in sheets to be cut in diamonds 
and iced over. 

JELLY SLICES. 

Bake a sheet of Genoise cake, or any mixture 
you are used to that will bake level and not rise, 
rounded over in the middle, and have it less than 
an inch thick when done. Turn it out of the pan, 



bottom side up, cut in long strips, split them and 
spread with red fruit jelly or jam same as jelly 
cake. Stir up a pearl glaze (No. 2) and spread 
over the top of the strips of cake. This glaze or 
icing can be made with water as well as with 
white of eggs, just enough to wet the powdered 
sugar so that it can be spread smoothly, and can 
be made pink by using fruit juice instead of 
water. When these large strips 01 jelly cake have 
been iced over with it, cut them with a knif? 
dipped in hot water, into long and narrow pieces 
and set them a little distance apart on pans for 
the icing to dry. 



MERINGUE MARSES. 

Make jelly slices like the last, but instead of 
plain sugar icing pile a thick covering of stiff 
meringue on top of the large strips, then with a 
knife dipped in hot water cut down through the 
meringue and cake and bring the knife straight 
up again, so as to divide the cake in narrow 
strips without displacing the meringue much. 
Smooth the sides and top of each piece, then bake 
in a slack oven to a light fawn color. The sheets 
of cake for this form need not be split, but jelly 
spread on the top and meringue on the jelly. 
The name *' marse " is probably foreign. 



HINTS ABOUT MERINGUE PASTE. 

The whites of duck's eggs make the firmest 
meringue. An ounce of sugar to an ounce of 
white of eggs is the rul ?. The whites should be 
beaten up quite firm at first — so that it will not 
slide about in the bowl and will stay in firm 
pieces wherever it is placed — and after that the 
sugar should be added in three or four portions 
and all beaten again. Too much heat in the oven 
will cause the meringue to shrivel and fall. 



MERINGUE SURPRISES. 

They are shallow pastry tarts containing half a 
peach or apricot and built up high with meringue, 
then, instead of being baked, are coated with hot 
fondant. The surprise consists in finding a fruit 
tart inside of what appears to be but a kiss me- 
ringue. Bake tarts in shallow patty pans. Cover 
with meringue by means of a bag and tube, lay- 
ing the meringue around the edge first and then 
another ring and another cone -shape until it ends 
in a tall point at the top. Run hot fondant all 
over it by means of a funnel with a handle, made 
for the purpose. When cold and dry remove the 
" surprises" with a knife from the marble slab en 
which the coating has been done, and the surplus 
drippings of sugar can be scraped up and saved 



THE AMERICAN PASTRY COOK. 



225 



MERINGUE PEACHES. 

The same in the main as the preceding " sur- 
prises," but instead of a cone, press out the me- 
ringue from a kiss tube to imitate the shape of a 
peach — of which the hidden tart is the founda- 
tion — color pink on one side with a brush dipped 
in carmine, then gloss over with hot fondant, 
having a slight green tint imparted hy the addition 
of green vegetable coloring while melting. These 
are not mere fancy notions, but are said to be 
among the best selling staple sweets of the 
London confectioners. 



JELLY ROLL MIXTURE, 

I pound of sugar. 

14 eggs — or I or 2 less, if large. 

I pound of flour. 

^ cup lukewarm water. 

}i teaspoonful of soda — small. 

Lemon or vanilla flavor. 

Beat eggs and sugar together until light and 
thick and increased to three times the original 
bulk, gradually add the water while beating, with 
the soda dissolved in it. Stir in the flour just 
long enough to put it well out of sight, as usual 
for sponge cake. 

Bake on manilla paper slightly buttered, and 
to get the roll of uniform thickness run the batter 
out of a lady-finger tube in lines on the paper al- 
most touching, that they may run together and 
make an even sheet of cake. 



SWISS ROLL. 

Having made the jelly-roll sheet as above, 
spread it with fruit jelly or jam, roll up, then brush 
©ver with sweetened water well flavored with 
lemon and roll it over in plenty of powdered 
sugar spread on a sheet of paper, then set it where 
the sugar coating will dry. 



VENICE ROLL. 

Roll up a sheet of cake spread with jelly or 
jam and ice it over with pink glaze or water icing 
(No. 2), made by wetting the icing sugar with 



red currant or cherry juice, or wine and coloring. 
Ornament the top and sides with a pattern in 
white egg-icing. 

PARIS ROLL. 

When the jelly roll is made, spread red currant 
jelly thinly all over the outside, then roll it in 
grated or desiccated cocoanut, enough to c»at it 
over. Some powdered sugar should be mixed 
with the cocoanut and then, if the roll be allowed 
to dry off, it will not be so liable to be sticky as 
the jelly and cocoanut alone will make it. 



CHOCOLATE ROLL. 

Make a jelly roll and cover the outside with 
chocolate icing (recipes for making different sorts 
may be found in the index), and then pipe on a 
wreath pattern in white egg-icing. 



JELLY ROLL COTELETTES. 

Make a jelly roll and with the rolling-pin roll 
down one side rather flat so that the slices, when 
cut, will have the shape of the meat part of a 
nicely trimmed mutton chop; the cake repre- 
sents the fat and the jelly the streaks of lean. To 
make the imitation better, ice the chops over 
with transparent glaze or water icing. When 
dry, build them in cake basket or dish in pyramid 
form. 

DECORATED JELLY ROLLS. 

Jelly rolls to serve whole on a set table may be 
covered with water icing or pearl glaze not beaten 
(No. 2), either white or pink, and then ornamented 
with white egg-icing in wreath or vine and leaf 
patterns down the whole length; or lines, or 
bands may be run down, and between the lines of 
icing run lines of currant jelly ; or, place sugar 
flowers, crystallized fruits or small ornamental 
candies. Another way is to moisten the outside 
with water icing thinly spread with a knife and 
then roll in pink sugar-sand or granite sugar, 
which is of a larger grain.
