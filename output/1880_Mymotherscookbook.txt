MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



What an euphonious title! — one we would not venture 
to change or presume to rival in many respects ; but as we 
(the daughters) are living in an age of progress, we will 
venture to suggest, without any disrespect to our mothers, 
that while their theories were perfect, we wish to add some 
suggestions and recipes, which, in our experience, we have 
found successful, and great improvements on the former 
editions, and have won for us from " the lords of creation " 
the pleasing commendation, " Wife, jour cooking of this 
(or that) dish has outdone our mothers — a thing we con- 
sidered impossible." 

In view of these most wonderful achievements in liouse- 
hold good, we have been stimulated to add new recipes, 
and to send this Cook Book forth into the world, confident 
of success, as every young housekeeper who is encountering 
the "fiery trials of life," will find remedies for most of the 
ills that flesh is heir to, and the means of securing happi- 
ness, and sunshine too, for her household, following Solo- 
mon's advice, "giving meat to her household and a portion 
to her maidens," well cooked and palatable.

PREFACE. 



A GENUINE Cook Book. Not a series of experimental 
conjectures evolved from the consciousness of a brilliant 
theorist in cooking, but a batch of practical recipes that 
have been embodied in luscious dishes, and bear the cre- 
dentials of gratified appetites. 

This is an attempt to falsify that sad proverb : " The 
Lord sends food — cooks come from another direction.'''' This 
book proves that food and cooks may both have a celestial 
origin. This is the domestic balm in Gilead. Here may the 
gratified husband find all those marvellous puddings, pies 
and i)ickles with which "his mother" stimulated and ap- 
peased his appetite when he was a clothes-consuming, 
cotton-headed school-boy. Here may the youth who is 
shedding his primal petticoats find the miraculous viands 
with which grandma has made Saturday afternoon a fore- 
taste of Heaven. Here may the timid, trembling, untried 
housekeeper, transplanted from her home of luxury to the 
three-roomed "straight jimmie" of a struggling and 
poverty-burdened husband, find herself transformed into a 
$4,000 French cook; while the world-wearied, exacting 
husband, who has worked into the tapestry that adorns the 
walls of his poor wife's memory the dreary words : "You 
ought to have seen how my mother could make it;" or 
filled her brain with the raven-like monotone: "Mother 
knew how to cook," will find "my mother's" brilliant sue-

cesses reproduced, and will be forced to acknowledge that 
if Paradise was lost by an apple, it may be regained by an 
apple pie. 

This book will render Divorce Courts an expensive 
luxury, instead of a social necessity. It is the housekeeper's 
Magna Charta. Her Emancipation Proclamation. It is the 
first eloquent muttering of the domestic revolution by which 
Ethiopia and Hibernia will be hurled from their throne, the 
Saxon race regain its supremacy, and those terrible kitchen 
mandates issued by Bridget and Dinah, before which the 
young wife was wont to tremble and turn pale, will be as 
powerless as the Pope's bull against the comet. 

The recipes gathered into this priceless volume have 
been sent from all parts of the known world; several even 
from New Jersey. Many delicacies were expected from the 
centre of Africa, by the courtesy of Stanley, but these 
have been unavoidably detained. King " Calico," remem- 
bering gratefully the hospitality of the " Future Great," 
has sent a rare and valuable recipe of his grandfather's, of a 
delicious i)reparation of cold missionary and queen olives, 
while an amiable and almond-eyed celestial sends a recipe 
for the cooking of a common and inexpensive domestic 
rodent. Rut these delicacies are withheld out of deference 
to venerable prejudices. 

Yet the most fastidious alderman need not dread famine. 
Here is a wilderness of pies, [)uddings, pickles, jellies and 
jams; here are more cookies and cream pies than could be 
found at a charitable Sunday-school picnic; every species 
of pie, except the " humble pie" of Uriah Heep ; mince pies 
so (concentrated in power, that a cubic inch is guaranteed 
to produce a kaleidoscopic vision of your grandmother; 
l)icklos of such potency that they aie warranted to produce

that delicate greenness of complexion and angularity of 
contour so much prized by young damsels in their earliest 
giggleJiood, and popularly supposed to be solely the fruit 
of a free consumption of slate pencils. 

The book reaches its eloquent culmination in the pro- 
duction of a Hash, in whose complex composition may be 
found representatives from the entire animal and vegetable 
kingdoms. As the secret of its structure has been hidden 
from the foundation of the world, it is appropriately called 
" mystery." This recipe alone is worth the price of the 
book. It is the triumph of eclecticism. It simplifies social 
economy by absolutely preventing waste. It is the redemp- 
tion of the Boarding House. It will ultimately promote the 
interests of general education by transforming the college 
hash from what it is into "a thing of beauty and a joy 
forever."

A WORD ABOUT COOKING. 



Assuming that the recipes contained in this book, for the 
preparation of our food, have been compiled with all the 
care that skill and experience could suggest, we are naturally 
led a step further, to inquire whether these beneficent results 
are not too frequently neutralized in those succeeding stages 
which attend the cooking of the food itself. While we can- 
not overestimate the im])ortance of good wholesome cooking 
to the health and comfort of our daily life, there is no de- 
partment in which its fundamental rules are less understood 
or more generally disregarded. 

Count Rumford, who spent a life-time in exi)erimenting 
upon the best modes of cooking, has given to the world the 
true theory, which has been confirmed by experience, and 
may be summed up in the sentence — 

USE LESS FUEL, AND TAKE LONGER TIME. 

He urges the economical use of heat by using but little 
fuel, and taking more time in all its various operations; for 
it is strictly true, that good cooking cannot he done in a hurry 

For instance, a loaf of bread cannot be thoroughly 
baked in less than one hour. A sufficient time must be 
allowed for the generation of the gas produced by yeast, 
which gives the loaf when done its spongy character that 
renders it light and wholesome. To secure this result the 
oven must not be too hot. A temperature of 350 degrees is 



10 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 

the utmost required for any kind of bread. The process is 
greatly aided, and a highly favorable result secured, by 
placing the equivalent of a saucer of water in the oven 
with the bread while baking. 

It may be well at this point to suggest how to regulate 
the Stove. 

When the oven is well heated, place within it the 
article to be baked, and at once close- the front draft as far 
as possible, simply admitting just enough air to carry off 
the smoke, after which two sticks of wood (or their equiva- 
lent) are sufiflcient to complete the work. 

For roasting meats a still less beat is required than for 
bread — a temperature of 200 degrees being enough, and 
better than more; but it is well to remember that the 
presence of water in the oven is as essential in the cooking 
of meats as in baking bread. A most excellent plan is 
adopted of using two drip pans, one within the other, the 
larger one containing the water, while the meat is placed in 
the smaller one. 

Meats should always be well basted at intervals during 
the process of cooking. 

An observance of these simple rules will effectually 
remove all complaints which follow the ignorant use of the 
modern oven, and we shall no more be reminded of the 
superiority of moats roasted before the tire "as mg mother 
used to do it." 

At the risk of rei)eating what has already been said, we 
cannot too strongly urge that tlie true secret of baking 
either meats or bread consists in using nuT a small 

QUANTITY OF FUEL. 

As a rule, one-half the usual weight consumed is ample 
to do the work, and do it well ; a saving is thus effected in 



A WORD ABOUT COOKING. 11 

the cost of fuel and in the wear and tear of tlie stove as 
well, while the work is done much more satisfactorily. 

Whilst we advocate the use of a small quantity of fuel 
to do good cooking, we also recommend the use of large 
cooking stoves to do the work of a family. Large stoves 
are cheaper in proportion to their size than smaller ones. 
The plates are usually heavier, they will last longer, and as a 
rule do better cooking. The plates of a stove should never 
be made red-hot ; whenever this is the case, it is certain 
that there is too much fuel used. Iron at red heat, visible 
by day, shows a temperature of over a thousand degrees ; 
at red heat, visible iu twilight, of over 800 degrees; bright 
red in the dark, of over seven hundred and fifty degrees; 
which is more than twice the amount of heat required 
for any ordinary cooking. Coal is more difficult to manage 
than wood ; where it is used great care should be taken, 
using as small a quantity as possible. What has been said 
in regard to cooking stoves applies as well to heating stoves, 
for both economy and durability.

SOUPS. 



The best soups are made from fresh bones and raw meat 
simmered gently for five or six hours. Soups ought never 
to boil fast, and every particle of grease must be carefully 
skimmed off. After cooking some time it is better to set 
aside until the next day, and then it ought to be a jelly, 
from which all the grease and sediment must be wiped oft". 
The second day this stock can be put on about two hours 
before dinner, add the vegetables chopped or grated fine, 
salt, pepper, celery seed or tops, and about one-half table- 
spoonful of butter rubbed into two tablespoonfuls of flour 
for thickening. Have some toasted bread cut into small 
squares in the tureen and pour over the soup. 

Soups can be made much richer by seasoning with any of 
the ketchups or meat sauces, such as Worcestershire sauce, 
walnut ketchup, etc. ; summer savory, sweet marjoram and 
celery seeds are also nice; a glass of wine, eggs boiled hard 
and chopped tine, orange cut in very fine pieces, without 
peeling. Some like lemon, while to others it ruins the soup, 
so the best plan is to slice the lemons and pass around after 
the soup is served. To make soups dark thicken with flour 
that has been browned in the oven, or brown sugar burnt 
black ; stale bread toasted in the oven rolled fine, makes a 
nice thickening. The general rule in making soup is to 
allow one pound of meat to one quart of water. 



14 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



PEA SOUP. 

A pint aud a half of split peas; two small oiiions; 
pepper aud salt to taste. Use three quarts of water aud 
boil from five to six hours. Pork is ofteu put iu, but makes 
the soup far less wholesome. If the water is hard, add a 
piece of saleratus not larger than a pea. It would be diffi- 
cult to find a way iu which the same amount of nourishment 
could be obtained for four times what this cost. — Hearth 
AND Home. 

BROWN SOUP. 

Take a beef shin and boil all day until it will become a 
jelly, when cold, strain it and set away until the next day. 
Then take a piece of butter size of an egg-, a large onion ; 
brown together in the same pan, then put in two or three 
tablespoonfuls of brown flour, two carrots if small, two 
turnips if small, piece of celery, little thyme, little parsley, 
allspice, mace, cloves, to taste. I generally take three or 
four cloves, one piece of mace (small), little pinch of allspice ; 
if you have not Chili pepper use common pepper; salt, 
Worcestershire sauce. Let it cook slowly all day. When 
the vegetables are thoroughly cooked, press them well 
through the strainer to get all the substance; put in a little 
macaroni, heaping wine glass of sherry wine, force meat 
balls ; let the macaroni cook, then serve it. 

Mrs. W. Maurice. 



CHICKEN GUMBO. 

Disjoint an old chicken aud fry brown in hot lard, after- 
wards fry in the same lard a small piece of ham, one-half 
the size of your hand, and a sliced onion; put it into the 
kettle with four quarts of boiling water, and boil slowly for 
four hours; one quart of sliced gumbo and one pint of sliced 
tomatoes (or a whole can if in winter) ; corn or celery tops 
improves it," one-half dozen cloves, pepper and salt to taste. 
Serve with boiled rice. 



SOUP. 15 



VEAI. SOUP. 

Put into a pot a knuckle of veal that Las been cracked 
in three or four places and carefully washed to get off all the 
little pieces of bone ; cover with about one gallon of water 
and let it simmer from two to three hours, the longer the 
better, skim well; about one hour and a half before dinner, 
add a little onion, pieces of minced celery or celery seed, 
salt, pepper; as veal makes a white soup it is very nice to 
add two cups of vermicelli or macaroni broken in inch 
pieces; or the same vegetables may be added and in the 
same way as for beef soup. Veal soup can be used the same 
day as made. 

VEAL SOUP. 

Boil a knuckle of veal with a cup of rice ; set it away till 
next day, add four eggs, one lemon, a little salt; strain it, 
beat the eggs and lemon together in the tureen, and pour 
the soup on it. Mrs. Sam'l Treat. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Take a bone with a nice piece of meat attached to it, 
have the bone cracked in two or three places so as to get 
the marrow, then cover with three or four quarts of water ; 
let it boil slowly for four hours or more, skimming well all 
the time, then put aside until the next day. About two 
hours before dinner skim oft' all the fat and grease which 
will be found caked on top of the soup, pour oft' carefully 
from the sediment at the bottom, then cook again, adding 
such vegetables as you may wish ; tomatoes, gumbo, a red 
pepper, a soup bunch having the parsley minced fine, the 
carrot grated, the onion and other things chopped fine ; 
season with salt, thicken with a little flour and butter 
rubbed together ; before serving, some jirefer to have all the 
pieces of meat and thick part of vegetables strained out. 

BLACK BEAN SOUP. 

Soak one quart of beans over night, and keep them 
warm ; drain oft' the water ; add fresh ; cook gently four or 



16 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



live hours, addiug water as it boils away; season with salt, 
pepper and cloves, while cooking. When done, strain 
thoroughly ; put in three slices of lemon, a sliced hard-boiled 
egg, and small pieces of toasted bread. Stock can be used 
instead of water. 

BEASf SOUP. 

One soup-bone, four or live pounds; one soup-bunch; 
one pint of beans, soaked over night. Boil the meat in a 
gallon and a half of water, for two hours ; skim when it 
comes to a boil. Put in the soup-bunch cut up; three or 
four sliced potatoes ; three or four sliced onions, fried in a 
tablespoouful of lard ; dredge in four tablespoonfuls of 
browned flour; season; if any more water is needed, add it 
boiling. Boil all for three hours. Strain before serving. 

Mary Colburt. 



SOl'R I>OCK M>UP. 

Take a quantity of the greens, clean the leaves from the 
stems. Put in a sauce-pan a piece of butter, when melted 
l)ut in the greens, let it come to a stew. Pour in a cup or 
two of water; when boiled, take the yolks of two eggs, beat 
with three tablespoonfuls of cream ; stir in and it is fin- 
ished; add a little salt. This is an excellent dish for the 
sick. Louise Vogt. 

MOCK TURTLK SOI P. 

First day. Take one large calf's head, with skin on ; let 
the butcher open ; remove the eyes and nose ; wash in cold 
water several times. Take out the brains, skin and tie them 
in a thin cloth; i)ut in a pot with the head and three quarts 
of water. Skim carefully, while boiling one hour; take out 
the brains and put aside ; add to the soup two onions, two 
turnips, one leek, a bunch of parsley; cover and let stand 
where it boils gently seven hours. At the same time put 
in a second pot, one old hen, a knuckle of veal and three 



SOUP. 17 

quarts water; boil seven hours; let stand over night and 
skim off the fat next morning. Second day. Take a stew 
pan that holds six quarts, put on the tire with one-half pound 
good butter, twelve ouuces sliced onions, four ounces green 
sage; let this fry one hour, then add the entire contents of 
the two pots cooked the day previous, and season the whole 
with one-half ounce black pepper, one-fourth ounce ground 
allspice, one tablespoouful salt and one of curry powder, 
little cayenne pepper, the yellow rind of one lemon grated. 
Let all simmer gently two hours, stirring often to prevent 
meat sticking. Strain through a cotton bag into a clean pot, 
add one-half pint of Madeira wine, juice of one lemon, boil 
one hour, and add meat balls while boiling and just before 
the soup is done. To thicken, brown and rub smoothly one 
pound of flour into one-fourth pound of butter in a frying pan, 
add some of the soup by degrees until it is thin enough to 
pour into the soup ; this must be added after straining and 
before boiling the last hour. Meat balls : Chop the brains 
already boiled with a pinch of dried thyme, the grated peel 
of one lemon, mix all with two eggs and flour to roll into 
balls size of a pigeon's egg, and fry in butter. Egg balls (if 
preferred) : The yolk of one Q.gg and flour roll in small

FISH 



TO BOIL FISH. 

Fisli should be scaled and thoroughly cleaned, well 
salted, and put in a cold place till time to cook. 

Boil in a tish kettle, with water enough to cover it, or 
wrap and tie in a cloth, and boil in any cooking vessel; if 
the fish is too large, it can be doubled in the cloth ; cover 
with more than two inches of boiling water, adding a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a tablespoouful of vinegar to every 
pound of fish. A good sized fish will cook in half an hour. 
Be careful not to break in taking it out. 

Sauce. Stir into a pint of boiling milk, a piece of butter 
the size of an egg, mixed with tiour; and a hard boiled egg, 
cut up fine; pour this over the fish, or serve in a sauce-boat. 

Mrs. O. D. Filley. 

FRIED FISH. 

Having cleaned the fish thoroughly, wipe dry; score it

OYSTERS. 



In using oysters raw always buy the largest you can, and 
if you are going to serve oysters in more than one way, it is 
best to pick out the largest from all the cans for raw, or 
fried; in soups and other things it does not make so much 
difference about the size. Eaw oysters must be served 
alone, with the best of wine or cider vinegar, mustard, salt 
aud pepper passed around. Lemons are cut in pieces about 
one-eighth large, lengthwise, with the skins left on, so that 
those who like can squeeze the juice out easily. 

RAW OYSTERS. 

The following is a handsome way to serve raw oysters : 
Take a nice clear square piece of ice, about ten pounds, and 
with hot flat irons melt out a deep dish in the middle of the 
ice, leaving an edge about one inch wide all around to keep 
in the oysters, it is not at all necessary to keep the inside 
edge straight or square, for the more jagged it is the prettier 
it will look; while doing it I kee]> two or three irons heating 
on the stove. Have a large platter covered with a napkin, 
and set the block of ice in it; (the base may be decorated 
with i)ar8ley or celery tops at will,) then i)ut in your oysters 
and they will get just cold enough to be nice. It must not 
be fixed too long before serving. The platter will catch all 
the water that melts from the ice. 

Mrs. E. F. Eichards. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Wipe dry one can of oysters ; beat up two eggs; season 
with pepper and salt; dip in the oysters, and roll them in 
cracker flour; have hot lard in a pan, and fry them quickly 
in it. Mary Colburt. 



0Y8TDBS. 39 



FRIEI> OYSTERS. 

Use for frying the largest oysters. Drain from them all 
the juice; take some soda crackers and roll them with the 
rolling pin on the bread board or table; when fine, season 
with plenty of salt and pepper ; have ready several beaten 
eggs; dip the oyster first in the egg then roll in the fine 
crumbs until covered thick ; have ready in your frying pan 
some hot lard or butter ; drop one oyster in first to see if hot 
enough ; fry quickly and turn when brown and don't let 
them remain in the fat one instant after done. Serve dry 
on a warm dish. 

FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

Put two cans of oysters in a stew pan and let them come 
to a boil ; then strain them out and lay them on a dish ; have 
ready one tablespoonful of flour, two of butter, a little salt 
and pepper ; stir well together, and pour in the liquor and 
let it boil for a few moments, stirring carefully; then put in 
the oysters, and when come to a boil pour over buttered 
toast. Mrs. Frank Filley. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

To half a can of fresh oysters poured into a stew pan, 
add about an ounce of butter ; half a tablespoonful of flour, 
previously stirred with a small quantity of milk ; when 
nearly to the boiling point, add milk to taste and boil for two 
minutes. Mrs. Lewis E. Kline. 

SCALIiOPED OYSTERS. 

One can of oysters; one-half dozen soda crackers, rolled 
fine; fill the dish with successive layers of crackers and 
oysters; seasoning the oysters with jjepper, salt, and little 
pieces of butter; pour the liquid over the top. Bake in 
quick oven for three quarters of an hour. 

Mary Colburt. 



30 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



SCAIiliOPED OYSTERS. 

Put the oysters in their own liquor over the fire, let them 
come to a boil over a slow fire, then lay the oysters in a 
buttered dish with alternate layers of cracker crumbs, a little 
butter and pepper; put cracker crumbs on top and brown 
them in the oven ; take care not to let them cook long enough 
to dry, and not have the layers of crackers too thick. 

OYSTERS OX TOAST. 

Take a can of select oysters ; drain off the liquor through 
a cullender. Take one pint of milk and one pint of cream, 
or one quart of cream ; put it into a sauce pan, and when it 
comes to a boil, add one tablespoonful of corn starch, 
previously wet in cold water; piece of butter size of an eg,g^ 
and salt and pepper. When this boils, add the oysters, 
cooking them only long enough to make the lips curl. 
Toast enough bread, cutting off the crust, to fill an ordinary 
size vegetable dish. When all is done, put into the dish 
first a layer of toast and then a layer of oysters. 

Mrs. J. G. Chapman. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Open your cans and drain the juice from the oysters; 
mix with the juice a little hot water; add salt and pepper 
and put in a stew pan on the fire; when it comes to a boil 
add more than a cup full of cream or milk. Let it come to 
a boil, being careful not to burn, then add the oysters and 
two spoonfuls of butter well stirred in ; let them boil five 
minutes, no longer ; serve in a hot tureen. Have oyster 
crackers to eat with them. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Drain the juice from a can or quart of oysters ; put on 
the stove and to it add one-half pint of water, one large 
cracker rolled very tine ; pepper, salt and a good bit of but- 
ter; when the juice is scalded drop in the oysters and cook 
until the lii)S curl, when they are done. 

Mrs. C. B. Richards. 



0Y8TUR8. 31 



OYSTER SOUP. 

Take one quart of oysters and separate them from the 
liquor ; wash them thoroughly in a pint of water. Strain the 
liquor, add one pint of milk, some mace, nutmeg and pepper, 
with three crackers pounded fine ; add one-fourth pound of 
butter; boil all together about five minutes; take it oft' the 
fire. When about to serve up the soup, put in the oysters 
and let it boil one minute, and the soup will be ready for the 
table. For each quart of oysters a pint of milk must be ad- 
ded and every other ingredient in proportion. Three pints 
of oysters are sufiicient for eight persons. 

Mrs. T. T. Eichards. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Have your oysters cooked as for stewed oyters, only add 
a little more thickening of craker crumbs and the yolks of 
two or three eggs beaten up very light. Line a deep dish 
with a rich pie paste and fill it with white paper, napkin or 
anything that will hold up the top of the pie; put on the 
cover and bake in a quick oven a light brown. When done 
take off the lid; take out the white ijaper or napkin and 
pour in the half stewed oysters ; set back in the oven a few 
moments and serve hot. Oyster patties are made in the 
same manner only the crust is baked in small tin patty-pans 
which come for that i^urpose, and they can have covers or 
not just as you choose, they look equally well without; some 
like a little nutmeg grated over them, and some a little lemon 
juice squeezd in. 

PICKLE OYSTERS. 

Fish out the oysters with a fork ; put them on to stew 
with salt to season them ; pour them in a cullender to drain ; 
then make a strong salt and water to wash them in ; after 
being washed perfectly clean, put them in a stone jar. 
Strain the liquor in which they were stewed through a cloth ; 
add spices, about one tablespoonful of black pepper, mace, 
allspice, cloves and a little ginger; put it on the fire and 



32 MY MO TREE'S COOK BOOK. 

boil until the liquor is well flavored ; then when about milk- 
warm pour to the oysters and let stand twenty-four hours ; 
then add vinegar to your taste. This quantity of spice is 
for a gallon.

MEATS. 



TIME FOR COOKING SUNDRIES. 

TIME GIVEN TO BOASTING ALL KINDS OF MEAT IS A QUARTER 

OF AN HOUR TO A POUND, AND THE 

SAME FOR BOILING. 



BOII.ED MEATS. 

Fresh meats should always be cooked in boiling water 
and kept constantly boiling, if not, the meat will soak up 
the water. If more water is needed be careful that it is 
boiling water ; remove the scum when it first begins to boil ; 
allow twenty minutes for each pound of fresh meat. Salt 
meats should be boiled in cold water, allowing twenty-four 
minutes to every pound. The more gently meat boils the 
more tender it is. 

ROAST BEEF. 

The best cuts are the tenderloin, and first and second rib 
cuts. Sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper, and dredge 
with a little flour; pour a little water in the pan to be used 
for basting; allow one quarter of an hour to the pound for 
rare meat ; longer if to be well done. When the meat is 
done remove to a hot platter, and then pour oft" the fat and 
thicken the gravy with flour that has been first rubbed to a 
smooth paste in a little water ; season it with salt and pep- 
per if necessary. Beef is better in winter when kept from 
two to four weeks. 

BEEF STEAK. 

A porter house steak one inch thick is considered the 
best cut for a steak, the next best is a sirloin. Trim them 
3 



34 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



nicely; many persous prefer their steaks well pouuded; 
sprinkle with salt and pepper ; lay it on the gridiron ; put 
over clear hot coals, turning over it a pan in order to keep 
the steam in ; turn it frequently, but be careful not to stick 
the fork in to let the juice escape. As soon as the steak is 
done put it on a warm plate with a lump of butter, press the 
steak with a knife on both sides so as to extract the juice. 

Mrs. C . 

YORKSHIRE PIDDIXG. 

One quart of sweet milk, four eggs, six tablespoonfuls 
of flour, a little salt, and I generallj' put in a very little of 
soda. To be cooked in the gravy of roast beef. 

Put the pudding into the oven and bake for an hour, 
then for another half hour place it under the meat to catch 
a little of the gravy that flows from it. Cut the pudding 
into small square pieces, put them on a hot dish and serve. 
If the meat is baked the pudding may at once be placed 
under it resting the former on a small three-cornered stand. 

Mrs. J. B. Flintham. 

FII.I.ET OF VEAL. 

Take six pounds of the leg of veal ; have the bone taken 
out. With a sharp knife make gashes through the thick 
part of the meat. Make a dressing of chopped raw salt 
pork, pepper, sweet herbs and bread crumbs, or use 
butter instead of pork ; fill in the gashes and the hole from 
which the bone was taken ; sew up, and tie tightly in a 
round roll. Put into a pan with a pint of water, baste it 
thoroughly, and bake for two hours. 

ROAIST VEAL. 

The loin is the best for roasting. Wash the j)iece to be 
roasted in cold water, sprinkle a little salt and pepper over 
it ; put a pint of water in the pan, and baste often with the 
drippings. Veal should be cooked very thoroughly. 



MEATS. 35 



FORCE MEAT BAI.I.S. 

Half a pound of veal, half a pound of suet chopped fine, 
a few sweet herbs and parsley cut tine, a little pounded 
mace and a small nutmeg, a little lemon peel grated, pepper 
and salt, the yolks of two eggs ; mix all of them well 
together, then roll them into small round balls, roll them in 
flour and fry them brown. If they are for anything white, 
put a little water in a saucepan, and when the water boils 
put them in and let them boil for a few minutes. 

Mrs. Sam'l Teeat. 



TO BOIL. A LEG OF VEAL. 

Put the meat in boiling water, with a few slices of pork 
in it. When done make a gravy of drawn butter. Time for 
cooking two to three hours. 



VEAL CUTLET. 

The nicest cutlets are from the round ; about half an 
inch thick ; season with salt and pepper ; dip into beaten 
egg, then in flour. Put into a skillet with hot lard, and fry 
a nice brown. When done, take out, make a gravy with a 
little flour and water. 



HAIJXCH OF VENISON. 

Take the venison, wash and dry well; butter a sheet of 
white paper, and cover it over the venison ; then cover with 
two or three more thicknesses of strong paper, tied on with 
strong twine; put into the pan, and as soon as in the 
oven baste the paper well and constantly to keep from 
burning; about thirty minutes before being done, which 
can be told by running a skewer in, and if tender, 'tis done ; 
remove the papers, and dredge the meat with flour and 
baste with butter, until a nice brown color. Must be served 
on very hot plates, and currant jelly passed around. 



36 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



VE^ISOlf STEAKS. 

Lay the steak on a gridiron over a clear, hot fire; turn

meat. Mrs. Cornelia Beer. 

CORX BEEF. 

To fifty pounds beef, three and a half gallons water, ten 
pounds fine salt, one and a half pounds brown sugar, 
one ounce saltpetre; rub into the beef a little salt and let it 
stand a few days until the blood is drawn out ; move the 
blood away ; pack the beef in a cask ; scald the brine, skim, 
and when cold pour over the beef. It will be fit for use in 
ten days or a fortnight. Mrs. Rhodes. 

BOILED CORX BEEF. 

Take either the blade or round of beef, let your butcher 
take out all the bones and roll it, tie it round with broad 
strong tape; put it into a large pot; cover it well with cold 
water; carefully take off the scum as it rises; when no 
more appears, keep the pot closely covered; let it boil 
slowly. Allow three hours and a half to a piece weighing 
about twelve pounds ; turn the meat twice in the pot while 
it is boiling. When done it is very nice to press it by 
putting it in a stone crock, putting a plate on top with a 
heavy weight ; let it stand until cold. 

BOILED S^HOKED TONGUE. 

Soak over night in cold water; in the morning put on to 
boil in cold water, cooking slowly three or four hours. 
When done skin it and moisten with the yolk of an egg) 
roll it in bread crumbs ; place in the oven until light brown. 



MEATS. 37 



Garnish the dish with parsley or celery, and serve hot. To 
be eaten with boiled turkey; or when the tongue is boiled, 
skin while hot, and when cold cut in thin slices and place 
neatly on a platter. Mrs. Lashells.

spoonful of chopped onions; one ounce of butter; one 
tablespoonful of flour; one teaspoonful of pepper and salt 
mixed; a little cayenne; half a pint of broth; one bay leaf; 
two eggs ; two pounds and a half of mashed potatoes. Cut 
out all the meat remaining on a cold saddle of mutton close 
to the bone, leaving an edge of about an inch and a half 
wide outside ; chop the meat small with a little of the fat. 
Put a dessertspoonful of chopped onions into a stew pan 
with a little butter, fry them for one minute ; add the meat, 
sprinkle over it a tablespoonful of flour; season it rather 
high ; moisten it with half a pint of broth, and put a bay leaf 
in the gravy; stew the whole for ten minutes, then add the 
beaten yolks of two eggs ; stir it till it is rather thick. 
Mash two pounds of potatoes very stiffly, so that they will 
form a paste; roll them out; form an edging with them 
round the saddle of mutton ; fill the empty space in the 
joint with the mince. If you have not meat enough to fill 
up the hollow, add any minced cold remains of other 
joints, provided they are mutton ; egg and bread crumb the 
saddle all over ; put it in rather a hot oven to brown. 
Serve with Espagnole sauce.

The fore and hind quarters of lamb are used for roasting. 
Sprinkle it with a little salt and pepper, and a little flour; 
put it in the pan with a little water; baste it frequently. 
Lamb must be thoroughly cooked. It is very nice to make 
a dressing of bread crumbs, butter, pepper and salt, with a 
very little sage or thyme ; lay this on the ribs, covering 
with the flap, and sew firmly, to keep it in its place. 



BOAST I.OIX OF POBK. 

Score the skin in narrow strips; rub it all over with 
powdered sage leaves, pepper and salt. Have ready a 
dressing of minced onions and sage, bread crumbs and the 
yolk of one egg, salt and pepper. Make deep incisions

BOIIiED HAM. 

Wash a ham well in soap suds and rinse in clean water: 
let it soak over night; in the morning put it on to boil in 
cold water, letting it simmer an hour, then boil slowly for 
three or four hours ; when done take it out and remove the 
skin and place it in the oven a short time. If you wish it 
warm for dinner spread with bread crumbs mixed with a 
little sage and return to oven to brown ; stick into it some 
whole cloves and garnish the dish with pastry or celery. 

BAKED HAM. 

Cover the ham with a paste of flour and water; while

from the ham; then sprinkle with rolled cracker and 
return to the oven to brown. Mrs. Wm. Maurice. 

BAKED HAMS. 

Soak the ham for an hour in clear water and wipe it dry ; 
next spread it all over with tbiu batter, and then put it into 
a deep dish with sticks under it to keep it out of the gravy; 
when it is fully done, take oft' the skin and batter crushed 
upon the flesh side, and set it away to cool. 

Mrs. Lewis E. Kline.

be easily chopped: chop it in a wooden bowl ; then pound it 
in a marble mortar or bowl, adding gradually the liquor in 
which the meat was boiled ; some nice marrow from the beef 
bones should be added before the meat is done, but if you 
have no marrow add a little melted butter as you pound. 
Season it with pepper and salt to taste, with a little cloves, 
allspice and grated nutmeg may be added. When finely 
pounded put it in small jars, press it down, and the next day 
cover it with melted butter which will preserve it much 
longer than if left open. Veal maj' be done in the same 
way, omitting spices except mace.

both sides with bacon ; put a calf's foot, a few onions, a 
carrot cut in pieces, a bunch of sweet herbs cut small, one 
or two laurel leaves, some cloves and a beaten nutmeg in the 
pan. Pour in a half a pint of red wine and a half a pint of 
white wine, a spoonful of brandy. Let it stew slowly six 
hours ; take it out and strain the gravy ; pour it on the meat 
and serve. Venison is very nice done in the same way ; both 
are better prepared the night before. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Purchase of your butcher a round of beef of twelve or 
sixteen pounds weight; let it lay in salt two hours; take it 
out; wash clean; rub with salt and saltpetre until very red; 
then take a tablespoonful each of allspice, mace and black 
pepper; mix them with the marrow which comes out of the 
bone; let it lay nine days in this mixture, turning and 
rubbing it every day ; then tie it closely in a cloth and steam 
it by the following process. Put your vessel for cooking it 
over the fire with a quart of water; place some sticks in the

cup in the middle to absorb the juice, then fill round the 
dish with a layer of meat; then potatoes seasoned with salt, 
pepper, cloves, a few sliced onions if liked, and a few pieces 
of pork; so on until your dish is full; pour in as much of the 
liquor the meat was boiled in as will almost fill the dish; 
j>ut an upper crust on, making a slit in the middle and pick- 
ing it with a fork, then put it in the oven to bake. Always 
in making meat pies of any kind be very particular and cut

butter them. When the chops have been turned for the 
last time you may strew over them some minced onion 
moistened with boiling water; season with pepper. Some 
like them flavored with mushroom catsup. 

Another way of dressing mutton cliops is, after trimming 
nicely and seasoning with pepper and salt, lay them for a 
while in melted butter; when they have imbibed a sufiScient 
quantity take them out; cover all over with grated bread 
crumbs ; broil them over a clear fire and see that the bread

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 



After roasting your meat pour olt" the (iripi)iug\s ; if too 
much fat pour part of it into ajar kept for that purpose ; it 
will be found good for frying; mix one tablespoonful of tiour 
with a little water ; rub it smooth ; add to the drippings left 
in the pan; as it browns pour boiling water on, adding more 
water as it thickens, stirring all the time. If lumpy, strain

care in removing- that the gall bag and the gut joining the 
gizzard are not broken. Open the gizzard, first take out the 
conteut.s, and detach tlie gall bladder from the liver. If 
poultry it< brought from market frozen, do not hasten to thaw 
it out before it is wanted for use; till then, put it in a vo\d 
place and let it remain frozen. When you thaw it use only 
cold water. Any frozen poultry or meat thawed in warm 
water will most certainly spoil. Food of any kind which 
has been frozen recjuires a much longer time to cook. 

ROAST Tl RKEY. 

Take a fine large turkey, if too fat take part of it out, 
singe it carefully ; see that the inside and craw are all re- 
moved, saving the giblets (neck, heart gizzard and liver) for 
the gravy. After it is thoroughly cleaned, wash the inside 
well, wi])e it dry, make a dressing of stale bread crumbs, a 
little salt and pepper, some sweet herbs if liked; add to this 
a hard boiled egg chopped fine. It may all be moistened 
with a little water or lemon Juice, and some good white wine. 
Stuff the turkey well with the dressing, both the neck aud 
the body, then sew it up. Cut up the giblets ; put them into 
a small sau('ei)an with very little water; stew them while tlie 
turkey is roasting: add a ])iece of fresh butter dredged with 
flour; when done take out the pieces of neck, retaining those 
of the heart, liver and gizzard; stir into the gravy after it 
comes from the fire, the yolk of a beaten egg; skim the gravy 
in the dripping i)an ; add it to the gravy made of the giblets. 

A roast turkey may be stuffed with oysters, or with 
chestnuts boiled, peeled an<l mashed with butter. If with 



POULTRY. 57 



chestnuts, thicken the gravy with whole boiled chestnuts. 
If witb oysters, send oyster sauce to table with the turkey. 
If chestnuts cannot be obtained, any roasted poultry is good 
stuffed with well-boiled sweet potatoes mashed with plenty 
of butter or meat drippings. 

BOII^SD TURKEY. 

Prepare and stuff the turkey as for roasting; a nice 
dressing is made by choi)ping half a pint of oysters and 
mixing them witli bread crumbs, butter, pepper and salt, 
thyme or sweet marjoram ; wet with milk or water; sew up 
the turkey in a thin cloth, tirst dredging the inside with 
flour; put it in to boil in cold water with a spoonful of salt 
in it; skim it while boiling; if very large will take from two 
to three hours. Serve with oyster sauce made by adding to 
a cupful of the li«juor the turkey was boiled in the same 
quantity of milk and eight oysters chopped tine ; season with 
minced parsley; stir in a spoonful of rice or wheat tlonr wet 
with cold milk, and a tablespoonful of butter. Boil up once 
and pour into a tureen. 

ROAST GOON£. 

A goose for roasting should be young, tender and fat; so 
tender that the skin can be easily torn by a pin ; if old, no 
cooking can make it eatable. Geese are not good for boil- 
ing or in a pie. In preparing a goose for cooking, save the 
giblets for the gravy : after the goose has been drawn, singed 
well, wiped inside and out, make a quantity of dressing; for 
this purpose parboil two good sized onions and a bunch of 
green sage; chop both the sage and onions, seasoning them 
with a saltspoon of salt, half as much black pepper, and still 
less cayenne ; add a hard boiled egg tinely minced. If your 
goose is large take two chopped eggs. To make the stuffing- 
very mild, add a haiulful of grated bread crumbs, or two or 
three juicy chopi)ed apples; till the body and craw with the 
dressing; secure it with a needle and thread from falling- 
out; set the goose in a baking pan with a little water; keep 



58 MY MOTHMR'8 COOK BOOK. 



it well basted; it must be thoroughly done all through. It 
will take from an hour and a half to two hours to roast, 
according to its size. The gravy for roast goose may be 
made the same as for roast turkey. 



ROAST PHEASANTS, PARTUIDOKS, ETC. 

See that your birds are thoroughly cleaned ; chop some 
tine raw oysters, omitting the hard part ; mix with salt and 
nutmeg; add the beaten yolk of an egg to bind the other 
ingredients; cut some very thin slices of pickled pork 
and cover the birds with them ; then wrap them closely in 
sheets of white paper well buttered; put them in a baking 
pan and roast by a quick tire. Send them to tiie table with 
oyster sauce. Pies may be made of any of these birds the 
same as a pigeon pie. 

ROAST DUCK. 

Take a ))air of tine fat ducks; put them for a few minutes 
into boiling water to loosen the skin, which must be i)eeled 
entirely oft" in order to be nice and tender : wash them 
thoroughly inside, wipe the outside all over with a dry 
cU)th, till the l)ody and craw with a seasoning of sage and 
onions, as for a goose. Roast them well; baste them all the 
time; make a gravy mixed with what has been made of the 
necks, livers, hearts and gizzards stewed in a small saucepan, 
with a lump of butter dredged with Hour; skim the fat oft"; 
pour over the ducks. The tishy taste wild ducks have is 
entirely destroyed by having an onion dressing. 

BOILED DrCK. 

Make a paste of half a i)ound of l)utter to a poiind of 
Hour; put into the inside a little salt and pepper, one oi- two 
sage leaves and a little onion tinely chopped ; inclose the 
duck in the paste with a little jellied gravy. P.oil it in a 
cloth; serve with brown gravy.

C:HICKEXS. 

Whether for boiling or roasting" should be pre])ared and 
have a dressing made the same as for turkeys. Six spoonfuls 
of rice boiled with the chi(!kens will make them look white. 
If the water is cold when put in, they will be less liable to 
break; they are improved by boiling a little salt pork with 
them. Chickens broiled should be si>lit down the back; 
inwards taken ont and then thoroughly washed; broil very 
slowly, placing the bony side down on the gridiron; as soon 
as nicely brown turn it on the other side. Chickens and game 
of all kinds may be prepared the same as for broiling by 
putting them in a baking pan; dredge with flour, season 
with salt and pepper, and water enough to keep from burn- 
ing; baste frequently. 

CHICKED PIE. 

Cut up and parboil a pair of chickens ; season with pepper, 
salt and nutmeg ; ])repare your dough same as for ))ie crust ; 
line the sides of the dish with the dough; put an inverted 
teacup in the middle of the dish ; fill round it a layer of 
chicken, a layer of raw potatoes cut very thin, with salt and 
pepper and a few thin slices of pickled pork; add as much 
of the liquor the chickens were boiled in as will fill the dish. 
Then cover the whole with a lid of paste. Important to 
make a cross slit in the top to let the steam escape; bake 
the pie about an hour or more. 

QUAir PIE. 

Take a tender beefsteak, cut it into pieces, say one or 
two pounds, and lay it raw upon the under crust in the bot- 
tom of the disii, cover the beef with salt and pepper and 
small pieces of onions shred tine; put a small dust of black 
pepper inside of eacii quail, and put seven or eight into a 
pie on the beefsteak, then put a very small quantity of water 
into the dish, put on a top crust and bake. The gravy is to 
be put in through the rose on the top of the crust with a 
small funnel, so as not to spill over the crust. The gravy is

Shell enough peas to make two quarts; put them in cold 
water, with three ounces of butter, and stir them about until 
they are well covered with the butter; drain in a cullender; 
put them in a stewpan with a bunch of parsley and half a 
dozen green onions; dredge over them a little tlour; stir the 
peas well and moisten with boiling water ; boil them quickly 
over a hot tire for twenty minutes, or until there is no liquor 
remaining. Dip a small lum}) of sugar into some water, 
that it may soon melt; put it in with the peas, adding half 
a teaspoonful of salt. Take a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut; work it together with a teaspoonful of Hour, and add 
this to the peas, which should be boiling when it is put in. 
Keep shaking' the stewpan, and when the ))eas are nicely 
thickened dress them in a high dish and serve.

EGGS 



TO KEEP ECJCJS THROUOlIOrX THE WIXTEK. 

Wasli the eggs clean ; have a nice clean box or butter 
lirkin, put a layer of coarse salt, place the eggs in it with 
small end down; do not let the eggs touch each other: then 
another layer of salt, so on, until you have i)a('ked all your 
eggs, making the last layer of salt; keep your box well 
covered. Miss K. L, Glovkk. 

TO PRESERVE ECJOS. 

Rub each one in salt butter, till every ])ore of the shell is 
closed, then pack in dry bran with the small end down, and 
put in a cool jdace. Fresh eggs thus treated will kec}) eight 
or ten months. 

TO KOIfi ECiiOS. 

Have ready a saucepaji of boiling water; put the eggs 
into it gently with a s[)oon, so that they may not crack ; for 
those who like eggs lightly boiled, three minutes will be 
found sutticicnt, four minutes will set the wliites nicely ; and, 
if liked hard, six to seven minutes will not l»e too long. 
Eggs for salad should be boiled from ten to tifteen minutes, 
and should be placed in a basin of cold water for a few 
minutes; they should then be rolled on the table with the 
hand, an<l tlu' shell will ])eel otf easily. 

POA<'IIEI> EGGS. 

Drop iVesh eggs in boiling water; wiien slightly cooked 
skim out and lay on slic^es of buttered toast ; sprinkle a 
little salt and pepper on each egg, and a small piece of but- 
ter, before serving.

BAK£D £OCi}S. 

Butter a dish well, and break the eggs very carefully ou 
it; put ou the toj) of each a little i)ei)per and salt, and a lit- 
tle butter, and ])ut them into a slow oven until well set; 
serve them hot. 

FRIKD EOGS. 

Break the eggs into cups and slip them into a frying pan 
of boiling dripping or butter. When the whites are set, 
take them up, drain them from the grease, and trim otf the 
rough edges. Place them in the centre of the dish ; and 
slices of fried bacon round the edge, or the eggs may be 
served on the bacon. 

TAiii OMEliET. 

From Ave fresh eggs take the whites of three; beat the 
yolks and two whites until they are very light; then add a 
half teacup of milk or cieam and a little salt; have an 
omelet pan hot with a little butter in it, pour in the eggs; 
when done through, spread on the whites, well beaten ; 
brown, fold over the omelet, turn into a hot dish and serve 
immediately. Beating the eggs, as if for cake, will prevent 
the toughness so often found in ordinary omelet. 

Mrs. W. Fallon. 

ECilG OMEI.ET. 

For a family of three or four persons, take about six eggs ; 
beat the yolks and whites separately, very light, then beat 
them together; season with a little salt and summer savory, 
if liked; bake them on a griddle, a little at a time, a round 
cake, then double over; serve quick and hot, as they come 
up so light that they are apt to fall if left to cool. 

Mrs. Richards. 

A XICE OMELET FOR BREAKFAST. 

Beat two eggs, yolks and whites together, in a bowl, until 
very light ; add a teaspoon of corn starcli, dissolved in a half 
teaspoon of milk ; beat all well together, for a few minutes ; 



90 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 

a little clioi>))e(l ]niisley can be added if wished. lu making 
any kind of omelet, salt and pepper should not be added 
until sent to the table, and to have them perfectly light, and 
not tough, the ingre«lients must be well and ([uickly beaten 
with a fork. This omelet is enough for three persons. 

Mrh. Lewis E. Kline.

EOC; OMELET. 

Break the eggs and use the same quantity of milk (in 
bulk); if eight eggs, about two cui)s of milk; small piece of 
melted butter, salt, pepper, a tablespoonful of Hour, wet tirst 
in some milk ; beat all together lightly, just enough to break 
the yolks well, and bake in a buttered dish; serve in the 
same; should rise very high. Mrs. H. Waterman. 

.SC RAMBLE 1> EGiiiN. 

For a family of six, mix eight eggs beaten light, with one 
small half teacuj* of milk; a little salt and pepper. Have a

little hot lard or butter in a skillet; pour tliem in and stir 
quickly to keep them from burning-; when done serve in a 
hot dish. 

Mix together chopped meat and bread crumbs, with pep- 
per, salt and butter, and a little milk; till some buttered 
gem-pans with the mixture; then break an egg carefully on 
the top of each; season with a little salt and pepper, 
sprinkle some very fine cracker crumbs on top. Bake in 
eight minutes. 

Lay some slices of buttered toast in a hot dish before the 
fireplace; put some butter and a little salt in a saucepan 
on the fire; break the eggs quickly on the butter, and stir 
one way with a silver spoon until it solidifies ; then remove 
it from the fire, still stirring, and spread upon the buttered 
toast; lightly pepper and serve at once. 

EGGS OX T04ST. 

Put one-half a pint of milk in a cup on the stove ; when 
scahling hot drop in three eggs, a little salt ; stir them in the 
milk, which should be hot enough to cook the eggs in a few 
moments, and thicken up the milk. Spread on buttered 
toast. This is a nice way to cook eggs for an invalid.

It is almost impossible to give the ]>roportions for making 
bi'ead, as each family must in some measure be governeil l)y 
the <iuantity and numb«*r of loaves they will need. The fol- 
lowing juoportions may be some guide: Take two gallons 
best wheat Hour, sift into a pan or a large wooden bowl 
kei>t for that purpose ; make a deep hole in the middle of the 
Hour; have ready half a pint of lukewarm water, in winter 
it may be a little warmer, but not hot or boiling; stir it well 



BREAD AND BISCUITS. 93 



into half a piut of strong fresh yeast (if the yeast is home 
made you must use from three-quarters to a whole pint); 
pour it into the hole in the middle of the Hour; with a spoon 
work in the Hour round the edges of the liquid, so as to 
bring in, by degrees, sutticient Hour to form a thin batter, 
which must be well stirred for a minute or two ; then scatter 
a handful of Hour over this batter ; lay a cloth over the pan ; 
set it in a warm place. This is called sponge. In the 
morning when the si)onge is risen so as to make cracks in 
the Hour over it (which will take four or live hours), scatter 
over it two tablesi)Oonfuls of salt, and have ready one large 
tablesi)Oonful of melted lard ; add about two quarts of either 
milk or water, warm, but not hot enough to scald the yeast, 
and Kutticient to wet it; be careful not to put in too much 
milk or water at once ; knead the whole thoroughly for as 
much as half an hour, as good bread depends much on the 
kneading, which to do well requires strength and practice; 
when suiiiciently worked, form the dough into a lump in the 
middle of the pan, scatter a little tlour thinly over the top, 
cover it; set it again to rise; then put your dough on your 
pastry board (which must be sprinkled with tlour), divide 
into loaves ; work into good shape ; have your pans nicely 
greased with lard, i>ut your loaves in, cover with your bread 
cloth, and let them rise; when light enough, put them in the 
oven, which must not be too hot: the loaves, to bake well, 
will take from two to three hours, according to the size: 
when the loaves are done, wra]) each in a clean (!oarse towel, 
])reviously made damp by sprinkling plentifully with water, 
then stand them upon end to cool slowly. Bread should 
always be ke])t wrapped in a cloth and covered from the air 
in a box with a close lid. If the bread has been mixed over 
night, and found on tasting to be sour in the morning, dis- 
solve a teaspooonful of soda in a little milk- warm water, 
and sprinkle it over the dough; let it set half an hour, then 
knead it. 

If you wish biscuit in the morning, take the sam(» (juan- 
tities as above, going through the same process, and add the 
salt and lard; work the dough well; let it rise over night.

In the moruiug kneading your bread, take out what is 
wanted for biscuit, roll out the dough and cut in biscuit

work more ilour into it; make into loaves. 

I'ARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 

Take two quarts of wheat tiour; make a hole in the cen- 
tre; put in a piece of butter size of an egg, a little salt, a 
tablespoonful white sugar; pour over this a pint of nearly 
cold boiled milk with half a teacup of yeast. When well 
raised mould it fifteen minutes and let it rise again ; then 
cut into cakes and rise ; when light, tlatten each with the

bits, and when the paste is thin enough take one third of 
them and stick in close rows ui)on the sheet; dredge with 
Hour; roll up the paste into close folds as you would a sheet 
of music ; tiatten it and roll out as before, adding another 
third of the bits of butter; do this three times. Finally cut 
off from the end of the roll a piece large enough to cover a 
pie plate and roll out (juickly ; butter your pic plates ajid tit 
the paste neatly in them; gather up the scraps and use iu 
the next sheet. If a top crust is needed lay the paste on, 
cut to tit, and i)ress down the edges with a knife or si)Oon, 
ornamenting it in regular form. Bake until a light brown.

This dish requires some experience to make it just right; 
although the whites make a prettier appearance on top. I 
think the custard tastes nicer to beat them in with the yolks; 
then, of course, it is not necessary to put it in the oven.

CAKES. 



In making' cake always nso the best butter and sugar. 
For ordinary cake use ])o\vdered sugar; lor sponge cake 
so"nie prefer tlie pulverized, otliers the granulated; and for 
fruit cake brown sugar, not too moist, as it will be heavy ; 
for this cake it is also nicer to brown the tlour by spreading 
on a biscuit i)au and i)utting in the oven. The ordinary 
method of mixing cake is to first cream the butter and sugar 
by putting them in a bowl and thoroughly mixing with a 
wooden si>oon, or some prefer the hand, the warmth of the 
hand quickening the process. Tlien take part of the milk 
and ])art of the Hour alternately ; if you use soda and cream 
tartar, dissolve your soda in the milk and sift the cream tar- 
tar in the Hour. Then break each egg over a teacup to see 
if good, before mixing together; beat the yolks light and mix 
with the cake dough ; then beat the whites to a stitf froth, 
and a<ld lastly the Havor, and it is ready for the pans, which 
should be well greased with lard. Always have the Hour well 
sifted. If you use sour milk your cake will be more tender, 
but you must use only soda and no cream tartar: if you i)re- 
fer to use yeast powder instead of soda and cream tartar, two 
teaspoons of yeast powder are equal to one of soda and two 
of cream tartar, and should be ]>ut in the Hour. Yeast pow 
der is always safer to give servants to use, as they are very 
apt to use too much soda, though yeast powder cake will 
dry much (juicker than cake made of soda and cream tartar. 

uiiiTi: spoxoi:. or 4x«ei.s* fooi> c akf. 

Whites of eleven eggs, one and one-half tumblers of 
granulated sugar, one tumbler of sifted Hour, one teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla, one teaspoonful of cream tartar: sift the 



CAKES. 155 

flour four times, add tlie cream tartar and sift again. Beat 

the eggs to- a stift" froth on a large platter; on the same 

platter add the sugar lightly, the flour very gently, then the 

vanilla; don't stop beating until ready for the pan. Bake 

forty minutes in a moderate oven. Try with a straw, and if 

too soft let it remain a few moments longer. Do not open 

the oven uutil the cake has been in fifteen minutes ; the cake 

pan should not be greased. Tumbler for measuring should 

hold two and a quarter gills. When cooked turn the pan 

upside down to cool ; remove the cake by cutting around 

the sides of the i)au with a knife. When the ingredients are 

measured make all possible haste to get it quickly into the 

oven with the least beating possible, just enough to properly 

mix the eggs, sugar, and flour— on this rests the secret of 

success.

PRESERVES AND CANNED FRUITS. 



In selectiiio' fruit for preserving and canning, always see 
that it is fresh and firm. If yon wish your j^reserves to 
look clear and bright, use the best loaf or granulated sugar; 
if for more common use, an inferior quality of sugar 
may be used, but it will not look so well and is more apt to 
spoil. The porcelain kettle is the best for preserving, and 
should be rather broad than deep, for fruit cannot be done 
equally if too much heai)ed. Always keep your preserves 
in a dry ])lace ; should you see, after they have been kept 
a while, a coat of mould on the surface, you need not throw 
thein awtiy until you have first tried to recover them by 
adding a little more sugar and boiling tlieni over again; but 
if tliey liavj^ an unpleasant smell and insects about them, 
then they must be thrown away. Keep preserves in small 
glass jars, as IVciinent opening injures them. 

Jellies are all made nearly in the same manner, using the 
juice of the fruit and allowing a i)ound of sugar to a pint of 
juice. Jelly-bags should be made of wiiite tlannel ; the bag 
should be first dipped in hot water, for if <lry it will absorb 
too much of the juice. 

Canned fruit rcijuires much less sugar than |>reserving, 
and is (fonsidered by many a great im])rovement upon the 
old-fashioned way of ))reserving, as it retains more of its 
natural tlavor and is certainly more economical. In mak- 
ing the syruj) for canned fruits, take a quarter of a pint of 
sugar to one ])int of water: will make syrnj) enough for one 
(juart can. 

PKFSKRVKO UIIXC'ES. 

Pare and core your (piinces, taking out the knotty and 
defective jiarts, cut them in (piarters, weigh your fruit, allow- 



PRESERVES AND CANNED FRUITS. 185 

iug three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, 
put the pieces in your preserving-kettle, cover them with tlie 
parings and a very little water, lay a large plate over them, 
boil till they are tender; take out the quinces, strain the 
liquor through a bag; boil the juice and sugar together 
about ten minutes, skimming it well, put in the quinces, boil 
them gently until they are quite clear and soft, take them 
out and spread them on large flat dishes; afterwards put 
them in glass jars, boil the syrup a few minutes longer, pour 
the syrup warm over them. You may boil by themselves 
the cores and parings, in as much water as will cover them 
well, till they are entirely dissolved, then strain them 
through a linen bag ; while hot stir in as much powdered 
loaf sugar as will forma thick jelly. To keep quinces well 
requires plenty of rich syrup. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Eemove the pits, allow a i)ound of sugar to a ]>ound of 
fruit; put a layer of fruit in a preserving-kettle, then a layer 
of sugar; continue thus until all are in; boil until clear; 
put them in bottles while hot and seal them. 

OREEX OAGE PtniS. 

Take an equal quantity of fruit and sugar, pour boiling- 
water on the plums and wipe them dry, prick them, then 
make a syrup of the sugar and one-half pint of water; when 
it boils put in half the plums, let them do slowly until they 
look clear, then take them out and put in the balance. If 
the syrup is thin, boil it longer. 

PRESERVE!) PEARS. 

Pare, core and quarter the pears, and put into the kettle, 
just cover them with water, and let them simmer until soft ; 
take them out and ]>ut three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
to a pint of water, and let it boil ; put in the pears, and let 
them simmer until the sugar has penetrated the pears, or 
about ten or fifteen minutes. Mrs. M. J. Davis. 



186 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



CITRON MEIiOX PRESERVES. 

Peel and slice the melon thin; to every j^ound allow a 
l)Ound of sugar; to six pounds of melon allow one-quarter 
of a ponnd of ginger root; boil the melon with two teaspoon- 
fuls of soda until soft; when cold soak in strong alum water 
one hour; boil the ginger root in a syrup of one pint of 
water to two pounds of sugar, and skim well, then put the 
melon in and cook until preserved. 

Mrs. E. F. Richards. 

STEWEI> CRANBERRIES. 

For one quart, make a syrup of one pint of water to two 
cups of sugar; let it scald, and then drop in your cran- 
berries. Mrs. Mary Copp. 

PRESERVE!) PEACHES. 

Take a firm clingstone peach, cut it round ; with the 
hands twist it round so that it will separate, as the stone 
will adhere to one side, cut it out with a knife, peel the 
pieces, them weig:h your fruit : allow three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar to one ])Ouud of fruit; lay them on a ])latter, 
sprinkle part of the sugar over them, let them stand three 
or four hours, pour off the juice into the preserving kettle, 
add the remaining sugar; when scalding hot ])ut in the 
])eacheN, an<l boil tifteeu or twenty minutes, until they look 
clear. Put in glass Jars. The flavor is improved by taking 
a few of the pits, blanch them and let them boil with the 
fruit. 

GRAPE PRESERVES. 

With yourtingers ])resseach pulp from the skin; boil the 
pulp about ten minutes, then strain through a cullender to 
separate the seeds from the pulp; put skins, pulj) and sugar 
together, and boil until Jellied, allowing three-(iuarters of 
a i)0und of sugar to one pound of fruit : weigh the fruit 
after the seeds are out. You will tind the Concord grape 
will make the best preserves. Mrs. Glover. 



PRESERVES AND CANNED FRUITS. 187 



PRESERVED PL.IJ11S. 

Take the large red ijliira, allowing three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar to one pound of fruit; put them in a stone 
jar or crock, a layer of plums, then a layer of sugar, so on 
till the jar is full; place a plate on top, set in the oven 
with a slow tire, let them cook slowly all day; when 
done take them out, put in glass jars, seal up for winter 
use. Miss E. M. Tuckkr. 

PRESERVED APPLES FOR TEA. 

Make a nice syrup of sugar and water, and put in it a 
small piece of ginger root; have some nice apples peeled 
and halved, pippins are the best to use; when the syrup has 
scalded up three or four times, drop in the apples, and let 
them stay until transparent. Pie-plant is also very nice 
prepared in this way. 

GOOD APPLE SAUCE. 

Peel, quarter and core as many apples as you desire, put 
them in a vessel with water enough to keep them from burn- 
ing, add half a cup of sugar; flavor them either with grated 
nutmeg, cinnamon, or grated rind of a lemon. After they 
are well cooked, just before pouring them into a dish, add a 
small lump of butter. 

CRAB APPLE PRESERVE. 

Make a syrup, allowing equal weight of sugar and apples ; 
when the syrup becomes cool, put in the apples; boil them 
without crowding until they begin to grow soft; then take 
them up ; boil the syrup in the course of three or four days 
and turn it on them wliile hot ; repeat this after a few days 
until they appear to be thoroughly preserved.

until the Juice is all out and spread it loosely on large flat 
dishes. Put the dishes in the oven after dinner, or 
when the oven is moderately warm, and let them remain a few 
hours, watching that the oven is not too hot. Eepeat this 
for two or tliree days; when it seems very dry, so that it is 
brittle, si)rinkle the finest powdered white sugar with a fine 
siftei over each piece and lay it in boxes for further use. 

Mrs. Henderson, Md.

CAXXIXG CORN AlVD TOMATOES. 

You have heard of the nectar that's sipped by the gods ; 
I can tell you of something that's best by all odds, 
And far more substantial, I know you'll allow, 
So listen, and how to prepare it I'll show : 

Take a peck of tomatoes fresh plucked from the vine. 

The "Trophy," I think, you'll admit very fine. 

Take the skins from their backs and their bodies thin slice, 

Put into the pot, boil up twice or thrice; 

Tlien condiments add, the salt and the pepper, 

These serve the good purpose to keep them the better; 

Have ready of corn three dozen large ears, 

Of this being too much you need have no fears; 

Let It be of its kind the sweetest and best, 

If the seed's from Nantucket you safely may rest; 

With sharp knife cut each grain right into the heart 

('Tis well that this surgery causes no smart), 

Then scrape the soft substance and milk from within, 

And be careful to keep it quite free from the skin. 

Next into the kettle and boil it awhile, 

Fifteen minutes or twenty will do it in style; 

Now into your cans you can put it in haste, 

And leave at the top an inch of clear space ; 

This is said to be needed for holding the gas. 

And without it there's danger of spoiling the " sass." 

Next winter if Queen Vic. from over the sea . 
Should honor herself by coming to " tpa," 
Serve up some smoking hot, and she'll soon buy a book 
And send it by telegraph straight to her cook.

little over a quarter of a pound of sugar toapouud of fruit; 
make a syrup of about a quart of water at a time, putting 
in fruit enough for only one can ; let your syrup, with the 
fruit in it. Just come to a boil, putting them in the cans 
before they crack open; seal them up. 

Miss E. L. Glovee. 

CA^XED PEACHES. 

The white Heath clings are preferred. Take white clings 
tolerably ripe, ring and pare them ; pare only enough for 
four cans; make a syrup of half a pint of sugar to one 
quart of water (this quantity usually tills two one-quart 
cans). First put in your kettle the water, add the sugar, 
when that is dissolved put in the peaches, cook them a few 
minutes, or until a silver fork will enter them easily, but not 
enough, for the fruit to break, then put in cans and seal 
immediately; can as soon as })08sible after peeling to pre- 
vent their discoloring by exposure to the air. Fruit of all 
kinds may be canned by the above rule excepting pears and 
quinces, which, if very hard, must first be boiled in clear 
water until tender, then make the syrup and let them boil a 
few minutes. The Bartlett ])ears, when nearly ripe, are very 
fine; they will not need boiling before ]nitting into the 
syrup. 

€ANBfEl> OCHRE AM> TOMATOES. 

To one peck of tomatoes take a quarter of a peck of 
ochre, slice the ochre, boil it first in a little water until ten- 
der, then add the tomatoes, boil both a few minutes, then put 
them in cans. 



PICKLES. 195 



PICKLES 



In preparingr pickles always use the best of cider viuegar. 
A, porcelain kettle is the best to use; copi)er should be 
avoided, as it is poisonous ; grape leaves are good to green 
them with, and a very little alum makes them brittle. 

CUCUMBER PICKI.es. 

Put freshly picked cucumbers in cold, strong brine, suf- 
ficient to cover them ; let them stand twenty-four hours ; 
then turn off the brine; boil, skim and ponr over the encum- 
bers again; repeat this every other day until the brine has 
been scalded three times; on the day following the last 
scalding throw away the brine and set the cucumbers, cov- 
ered with fresh cold water, over the fire, first lining the 
kettle with grape leaves ; cover the pickles closely with the 
leaves and put in the kettle a small piece of alum; scald 
(Tiot boil) the pickles nntil they begin to turn green ; then 
turn off the water; wipe the pickles; put them in jars and 
pour over them good cider vinegar that has been boiled fif- 
teen minutes and well skimmed. Boil in the vinegar whole 
cloves, allspice, peppercorns and another small bit of alum. 
Wiien cold, cork or seal the jars, and put in a cool place. 

Mrs. J. M. Krum. 

CUCUMBER PICKI.es. 

Make a brine not too strong, not strong enough to bear an 
Q.^^^ and pour over your cucumbers, hot; repeat this three 
times in nine days; take out of the brine; drain and wipe 
well; then put them in jars with your s[)ices, horseradish, 
etc.; ])Our cold vinegar over them; let them stand three 
weeks before using Mrs. Cornelia Beer.

DISHES FOR INVALIDS. 



Ill prepariug auytbing for invalids, see that it is perfectly 
clean aud as tempting as possible. Put a clean white uapkin 
on a waiter, serve up the food in small quantities, using the 
best china or stoneware. 

BEEF TEA. 

Take some nice raw beef cut into small pieces, taking out 
every particle of fat or stringy part, sprinkle the pieces 
with a little salt, put into a thick bottle, or I think a tin 
farina or milk-boiler the best, and then there is no danger 
of any breakage ; cover close, and set that into the outside 
boiler containing cold water; as the water gradually heats 
it draws thejuices of the beef out better; cook about three 
hours, turn out into a bowl, and skim off every particle of 
grease, of which there should be but very little, if any; or, 
if there is time, let it get cold, and it can be more easily 
skimmed; some prefer it cold. From three to four pounds 
of beef makes about one pint of beef tea. 

E. F. Richards. 

BEEF TEA Bfo. 3. 

To each pound of fresh beef (the round is the best) add 
one pint of cold water; cut the beef in small pieces; pour

boiling point; do not let it boil; add salt to taste; a little 
pepper for those who like it; strain. 

MUTTOX BROTH. 

Take a nice mutton bone with a good bit of meat attached, 
cover with cold water and let it cook until the meat falls 



212 MY MOTHER'S COOK BOOK. 



from the bone in rags, strain the liquor and let it get cold, 
so that the fat can be easily skimmed off; season with salt, 
add some rice or barley, wliich has been ])reviously swelled 
or (cooked in water, to thicken; serve hot. Veal broth may 
be made in the same way, also chicken broth; some add a 
little milk. 

CHICKEX JKLLY. 
Have the chicken well cleaned, cut u]) into small i)ieces, 
and crack the joints and bones well ; cover with about two 
quarts of water, put on the back of the stove, and let it stew 
gently ; when cooked down about half, strain the liquor off, 
season with salt and pepper, and skim when cool. 

TOAST. 

Toast water is made by breaking u}) some pieces of toast 
into a bowl, pouring over them boiling hot water : when cold 
strain off'; add a little sugar. 

Milk toast is made l)y j>ouring some hot milk seasoned 
with salt and thickened with a little corn starch, previously 
rnbbed smooth with a little cold milk, over some slices of 
toast that Imve been already softened by the hot water. 

A large teaspoonful of currant or cranberry jelly or bar- 
berry preserves stirred into a goblet of ice -water makes a 
very palatable drink for invalids. 

BITTKK.MII.K WIIKY.
