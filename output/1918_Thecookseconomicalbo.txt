SOUPS 

Soup, by some people mistakenly thought to be an expensive 
luxury, is generally a means of economy since the most tempting 
and nutritious soups can be made of the most inexpensive 
materials. 

Soup stock is the basis of all meat soups. It consists of the 
soluble portions of meat, vegetables, and sometimes other ingre- 
dients, dissolved in water. For stock-making a deep kettle with 
a tight cover has been found to be the best. 

Soup Stock 

Wash four pounds of lean beef and put it into four quarts of 
cold unsalted water. Let it come to a boil slowly and skim well. 
Add a little salt and a dash of cold water to assist the skum to 
rise. Skim again, and set it back and let it boil gently for six 
or eight hours, or until the meat is in shreds. Add a little pepper 
and strain through two thicknesses of cheese-cloth into a stone 
jar. Cool and remove all grease. This stock will keep for many 
days if kept in a cool place. 

Mixed Vegetable Soup 

To one quart of stock add two heaping tablespoon fuls each 
of chopped onion (fried), chopped celery, and turnip either 
chopped or cut with a vegetable cutter, one tablespoon ful of 
carrot prepared like the turnip, and one cupful of cooked strained 
tomato. 

Summer Vegetable Soup 

Prepare as for mixed vegetable soup. Omit the onion and 
tomato and add small green peas and flowerets of cauliflower, 
asparagus tips, or all three. 

Tomato Soup 

Add one pint of stock to one half can of tomatoes, stewed 
and strained, and one half teaspoonful of sugar. 

Tomato soups must be made with great care to prevent the 
acid in the tomatoes from curdling the milk. Adding a little soda 
helps to neutralize the acid. Draw the saucepan away from the 
heat before adding the soda ; otherwise the tomato may foam 
over. Pour the tomato slowly into the milk ; if the milk is poured 
into the tomato, it will curdle. Take care not to combine milk 
and tomato till just before serving as milk heated with acid is 
almost sure to curdle. 



Tomato Soup 

To 2 quarts of stock add 1 quart tomatoes, 4 medium-sized 
onions, 1 dozen cloves, ^4 teaspoon mace, a few stalks of celery, 
a little cayenne pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Boil 2 hours. Put 
through a sieve to remove seeds, and add 2 tablespoons of rice. 
Boil one half hour or until rice is tender. 

Tomato Bisque 
One quart tomatoes stewed and strained. Let the juice come 
to a boil and add 1 heaping teaspoon soda ; stir until it foams, 
then add 3 pints of milk. When it comes to a boil remove from 
fire, add pepper and salt to taste, and butter the size of an egg. 
Thicken with very fine cracker crumbs. 

Cream of Tomato Soup 

5^ can tomatoes 1 quart milk 

2 tbsp. butter 1 tsp. salt 

2 tbsp flour %. tsp. pepper 

few grains soda 
Scald the milk and thicken with the flour and butter. Cook 
the tomatoes 10 minutes or until soft, add the soda and strain. 
Stir the tomato slowly into the thickened milk, taking care that it 
does not cook after being mixed, and serve at once. 

Tomato Soup 
Cook 5 good sized tomatoes and strain. Then add ^ teaspoon 
soda, 1 pint milk, butter, salt, and pepper. 

Cream of Asparagus 

1 bunch asparagus 2 tbsp. butter 

1 quart water 2 tbsp. flour 

1 pint milk Salt and pepper 

Break oflf the heads and cook them with the stalks in the water. 
Take out the heads as soon as they are tender and either serve 
them on toast or put them in the tureen before turning in the soup. 

Cream of Celery Soup 

3 roots or 3 stalks celery with 2 tbsp. butter 

leaves 2 tbsp. flour 

1 pint hot water Salt and pepper 

1 quart milk 
Wash the celery, cut in short pieces, and simmer until tender. 

Corn Chowder 
Cut 2 medium slices salt pork into very small bits. Fry until 
very well browned. Add 2 onions sliced thin and cook until 
tender. To this add 1 quart milk and the corn cut from 5 or 6 
medium ears. Let boil until corn is thoroughly cooked. Thicken 
slightly if desired and serve with crackers or toast.

FISH 

In food value and digestibility, fish is much like lean meat. As 
it is less stimulating, it is especially suited to the needs of brain 
workers who take little exercise. It is more desirable as means 
of varying the diet than as a staple food. Fish is hurt more by 
keeping than meat and if kept too long it is watery when cooked.

Stuffing for Baked Fish 

1 cup bread crumbs Few grains pepper 

1 tbsp, melted butter Few drops onion juice 

Yz tsp. salt 1 tbsp. parsley cut fine 

Mix the ingredients in the order given. This recipe makes 
stuffing for a four-pound fish. 

Directions for Baking a Fish Whole 

Fill the cavity with stuffing, allowing it room to swell slightly. 
Sew the slit over and over with strong thread, taking stitches deep 
enough not to tear out. If the fish is a dry one, cut gashes cross- 
wise and put in them strips of fat salt pork about one inch long. 
Skewer and tie the fish in the shape of the letter S, and set up- 
right surrounded by bits of salt pork, on a greased fish sheet on 
a baking pan. Bake until brown (45 to 60 min.), basting often. 
Serve with drawn butter or Hollandaise sauce. 

If you have no fish sheet, lay two strips of cloth across the 
pan and lift the fish out, when done, by these. 

Directions for Broiling a Fish 

Use a close-barred double wire broiler. Grease it when hot 
with salt pork rind. See that the fish is wiped dry, sprinkle it 
with salt and pepper, and if not oily, rub it with melted butter. 

Broil split fish, flesh side to the heat, turning occasionally. Turn 
slices of fish often. When cooked, carefully loosen both sides of 
the fish from the broiler, and slip oflf on to a hot platter. Spread 
with butter, salt and pepper, or with tartar sauce, and garnish 
with parsley and slices of lemon. 

Directions for Boiling a Fish 

To the water in which the fish is to be boiled add the juice 
of half a lemon, or one-fourth cup of vinegar. Place the fish on 
a fish rack or a plate or coil it in a wire basket. If on a plate, 
tie fish and plate in a piece of clean cheese-cloth. When the water 
boils, lower the fish into it and let it simmer until the flesh separates 
from the bones. When nearly done, add a tablespoonful of salt. 
Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon and serve on a platter 
with drawn butter or tartar sauce.

To clean oysters, drain off the liquor, straining it through a 
wire strainer if it is to be used. Rinse the oysters in a colander, 
using only half a cup of water to a quart of oysters to avoid

MEATS 

When you roast beef, first rub it with salt and pepper, place it 
in a dripping pan and cook in a hot oven; baste occasionally, 
leaving the door open a few moments. 

In boiling meat, if it is fresh put it in hot water. Salt meats 
should be put in cold water. In both cases they should be kept 
boiling slowly and skimmed well. 

When buying beef to roast, by having the butcher take out the 
bones and putting the meat in shape with skewers, a good soup 
may be made of the bones. 

Should you have a roast that has become a little old, put 2 or 3 
tablespoons of vinegar in the dripping pan and sprinkle a little 
sugar on the bottom of the oven. The fumes will work wonders. 

In cooking steaks it is better to turn them several times on a 
platter containing a little olive oil than it is to hammer them. The 
object is not to force the juice out, but to soften the fiber. 

Meat that is frozen should always be thawed by placing in 
cold water. 

Keep a basin of water in the oven; the steam from the hot 
water not only prevents scorching but makes the meat look better. 

In boiling meat or fowl that is tough, put a tablespoon of vine- 
gar in the water you boil it in. It will make it very tender. 

Lamb and mutton chops are broiled like beefsteak; mutton 
chops may be slightly red in the middle. Lamb chops should be 
less rare. 

For a brown stew, the meat and sometimes the vegetables are 
browned in hot fat before being simmered. A brown stew without 
vegetables is a fricassee. 

The lean of good beef is firm and elastic, and, when first cut, 
purplish red, the surface becoming bright red and moist after 
exposure to the air. The best cuts for broiling are the steaks 
from the loin of beef (short, porterhouse, sirloin). 

In a chicken or young fowl the scales on the legs are yellow and 
soft and the breast bone yielding. 

In a young duck or goose the windpipe is brittle enough to snap 
readily between the thumb and finger, and the feet are soft and 
yellow. Neither ducks nor geese are good if more than one year 
old.

Broiled Steak 

Have the coals glowing hot, without flame or smoke. Grease 
a double broiler with steak fat. Put steak in and hold it near the 
coals for a few seconds. Turn the broiler, and hold the other 
side down for the same length of time. When well seared, hold 
it farther away from the fire, turning occasionally until the meat 
is browned. Just before taking it from the fire sprinkle with 
salt and pepper turning each side to the heat once more to cook 
in the seasoning. Lift to a warm platter, spread sides with butter, 
garnish if preferred and serve at once. For quick and efficient 
service use gas for broiling. 

Roast Beef 

Wipe beef with a clean cloth, skewer and place in a dripping 
pan with the skin side down, dredge meat and pan with flour. 
In the pan put 1 tbsp. salt and ^ tsp. pepper. If the meat is very 
lean, put in a few bits of fat. When the beef is seared and the 
flour brown, reduce the heat, and baste the meat about once in 
ten minutes till done. After the meat has been in the oven half 
an hour turn over to brown the skin side. 

After removing the roast to a plate, pour or skim ofif most of 
the fat from the liquid. Set the pan on the stove, and dredge 
with flour (about 3 tbsp.). Add 1^^ cups boiling water, and boil 
5 minutes stirring constantly. Add salt and pepper to taste and 
strain into a gravy boat. 

Pot Roast of Beef 

4 slices of salt pork cut in small pieces and fried till brown. 2 
small onions, fried till brown. Fry the pork in a kettle. Then the 
onions. Sear beef on both sides in the fat until brown. Pour on 
boiling water until the meat is well covered. Add more as this 
boils away. At dinner time let the water boil down till the meat 
fries once more. Take out the meat before it burns, then pour 
in water and thicken to make a rich brown gravy. 

18 



Dry Panned Steak 

Place pan on stove and heat it very hot. Rub with suet and put 
in the steak ; when seared, turn and. sear the other side. Cook at 
a high heat for 5 minutes, turning every minute. 

Hamburg Steak Loaf 

Put thin slices of bacon in the bottom of a bread tin and over 
this a layer an inch thick of hamburg steak which has been sea- 
soned with salt, pepper and onion. Put an equal amount of dress- 
ing over this that has been prepared like the dressing for stuffed 
chicken, then another layer of steak, then more bacon and lastly 
pour a little milk over all. Bake rare or well done according to 
taste. It will draw away from the sides of the pan and come out 
in the shape of a loaf.

Veal Stew 

Boil 33^ pounds of the breast of veal 1 hour in water enough 
to cover. Add a dozen potatoes and cook half an hour or until 
the potatoes are done. Before taking from the stove add 1 pint 
of milk and flour enough to thicken and season to taste. 

Veal Pie 

Make a crust as for chicken pie, bake in two pie pans. Place 
one of the crusts on a platter, pour the stew over this and place 
the other on top.

y^ lb. salt pork Salt to taste 

%. tsp. parsley 1 small onion 

Dash red pepper 1 tbsp. crumbs 

Cover top with bacon and bake 1 hour. 

Breaded Veal Cutlets 

Fry the cutlets until nearly done. Take out and dip into beaten 
tgg and then in crumbs with a little salt stirred in. Fry again 
turning often so as to get an even brown on both sides. Season 
if not salted enough. 

Cutlets may be served with tomatoes if desired. 

Veal Scallops 

Cut lean veal into pieces the size of oysters. Salt and pepper 
and add a little mace. Dip in tgg then in cracker crumbs and fry 
the same as oysters. 

Veal vvith Oysters 

Fry 2 lbs. veal cut in thin bits and dredged with flour in suffi- 
cient hot lard to prevent sticking. When nearly done add 1^ 
pints oysters, thicken with flour; salt and pepper to taste and 
cook until done.

3 tbsp. bread crumbs 1 oz. chopped suet 

1 onion tchopped 
y2 tsp. salt 

Separate each joint of the loin with a chopper and make a deep 
incision into the thick part of the pork for the stuffing. Prepare 
the stuffing by mixing the crumbs with the onion, add the sage, 
pepper, salt, and suet, and when all is well mixed press the mix- 
ture into the pork. Sew edges together and bake in a dry baking 
pan in a brisk oven, basting occasionally. Bake 30 minutes for 
each pound and then 30 minutes more. 

20 



Roast Sparerib 

Trim off the rough ends. Crack the ribs across the middle. 
Rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper ; fold over and stuff with 
turkey dressing. Sew up tightly and place in a dripping pan with 
a pint of water. Baste frequently, turning over once so both 
sides will be brown. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton 

Cover mutton leg with boiling water and let come to a boil. 
Boil 5 minutes. Skim and simmer until meat is tender. This may 
be served with a caper sauce made by adding V/i cups drained 
capers to lj!/2 cups drawn butter made with mutton liquor. 

Roast Lamb 

Let lamb heat through slowly in a moderate oven. Dredge with 
flour, then quicken fire. Put a pint of water into the dripping pan 
with a teaspoon of salt. Baste the meat occasionally. Roast 15 
or 20 minutes to each pound. Make a gravy as for any roast, 
add a mint or bay leaf if desired. 

Lamb Stew with Peas 

Cut neck or breast veal in pieces and place in a stew pan with 
some salt pork sliced thin and enough water to cover it. Let stew 
till tender. Skim and add a quart of green shelled peas, more 
hot water, if necessary, and cover till the peas are tender. Add 
a bit of butter rolled in flour and pepper to taste. Let simmer a 
few moments and serve. 

Lamb Scallop

over, seasoning to taste. In a dish put a layer of meat, a layer 
of crumbs and a layer of cooked tomatoes until all is used. Cover 
with buttered crumbs, and bake until brown. 

Boiled Ham 

For a 10 pound ham wash and boil gently for 3 hours. Remove 
the skin and put the ham in a large pan in a moderate oven until 
brown. It improves it if whole cloves are placed in it before 
baking. 

Ham and Eggs 

Fry % lb, fresh ham cut in small cubes and 1 small onion sliced 
fine. Add 6 slightly beaten eggs and scramble the eggs and ham 
together. Cubes of boiled ham may be used instead of the fresh 
ham. 

21 



Chicken. Pie 

Cook fowl in salted water till tender. Take out largest bones, 
place meat in baking dish in layers with butter, salt and pepper 
until the pan is 7^ full. Pour in chicken broth and cover with 
the following crust. 

Chicken Pie Crust 

Sift 4 tsp. cream tartar and 2 tsp. soda with 1 large quart flour. 
Rub in butter the size of a large egg and mix with sweet milk to 
make a stiff batter. Wet the edge of a baking dish, cover chicken 
with batter and cut slit in center for the steam to escape. Bake 
30 minutes. 

Jellied Chicken 

To 3 pints of cold chicken stock add beaten whites of 2 eggs 
and 1 box gelatine which has been soaked in a cup of water 1 
hour. Heat all together and skim ; add chicken, cooked and cut 
up fine, season with onion, celery salt, salt and pepper, and when 
the gelatine begins to harden, pour all into a mold. 

Fried Chicken 

Cut up a young chicken ; season with salt and pepper and dip 
each piece in a beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs. Mix butter 
and lard enough to fry the chicken in and heat boiling hot. Fry 
the chicken slowly till both sides are well browned. Place the 
chicken in a covered dish and thicken the gravy with a large 
tablespoon flour and add a cup of sweet cream, salt, and pepper. 
Pour over the chicken and serve very hot. If the chicken is old 
simmer in a little water until tender before frying. 



Broiled Chickens 

Split spring chickens down through the breast. Wash and wipe 
thoroughly and rub both sides with salt; dredge with flour, and 
put in a baking pan with a little water. When nearly cooked, 
remove to a buttered broiler and brown over hot coals. 



Poultry and Game 

In market terms, chicken not more than five months old is 
"spring chicken"; chicken over a year is fowl. Full grown 
poultry is finer in flavor than young chickens. In a chicken or 
young fowl the scales on the legs are yellow and soft and the 
breastbone yielding. Pin feathers are usually an indication that 
the chicken is young. 

22 



In a young duck or goose the windpipe is brittle enough to snap 
readily between the thumb and finger, and the feet are soft and 
yellow. Neither ducks nor geese are good if more than one year 
old. 

Chicken Fricassee 

1 fowl 2 tsp. salt 

1 qt. boiling water 2 tsp. parsley cut fine 

1 small onion Sprigs of parsley for garnish- 

ing 

Cut the chicken in pieces. Brown the onion in a little fat and 
put with chicken meat and bones. Add water and let simmer till 
nearly evaporated. (About 1 hr.) Take out the bone, pour off 
the liquid and let the meat and sediment brown delicately, stirring 
and turning the pieces. Then pour back the liquid with enough 
water to make 2 or 3 cupfuls in all. Add salt and simmer for 
another hour. Arrange the pieces on a platter, neck and tail in 
the center, breast pieces and wishbone on top of these, second 
joints at one end of the dish, legs crossed at the other, and wings 
and side pieces at either side. Thicken the gravy with flour 
and pour over the chicken. Sprinkle and garnish with parsley. 
The fricassee may be served in a border of rice. 

Chicken Stew 

Prepare like chicken fricassee, except do not brown the chicken. 
Reduce the liquid to 1^ cupfuls and add 1 cup milk and thicken 
with 4 tbsp. flour. Stewed chicken, lacking the flavor of browned 
meat, is better served on toast than with the comparatively taste- 
less rice. 

Creamed Chicken 

Melt 1 tbsp. butter, add 1 tbsp. flour, pour in slowly 1 cup hot 
milk or cream. Add salt and pepper and 1 cup chicken meat cut 
into small pieces. 

Roast Turkey 

After singeing the turkey, plump it by plunging it quickly three 
times in boiling water and three times in cold, holding it by the 
legs. Drain and dress. Prepare the stuffing by taking pieces of 
dry bread and crust (not too brown). Place in a pan and pour 
on a little boiling water, cover tightly with a cloth and let stand 
until soft ; add a large lump of butter, salt and pepper, and one 
or two fresh eggs and the bread from which the crust was cut 
so as not to have it too moist. Mix well and season to suit taste 
with salt, pepper and sage. Rub the inside of the turkey with 
salt and a little pepper, and stufif. Sew up each slit with a strong 

23 



thread ; tie the legs down firmly, and press the wings closely to the 
sides, securing them with a cord tied around the body or with 
skewers. Steam from one to three hours or until easily pierced 
with a fork. Place the turkey in a pan with water from the drip- 
ping pan in which the turkey was steamed ; butter the turkey, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and if there is 
not enough water in the pan, keep adding boiling water, basting 
often. Cook until a nice brown and perfectly tender. Remove to 
a hot platter and serve with cranberry sauce. 

Skim off most of the fat of the gravy, and add water if neces- 
sary. Chop the heart, gizzard, and liver (previously boiled in 
water for 2 hours) and add to the gravy with the water in which 
they were boiled. Season with salt and pepper and add a smooth 
thickening of flour and water and stir constantly until the flour 
is well cooked. 

Roast Goose 

Take a 10 pound goose and wash thoroughly. After cleaning, 
put it in a large kettle with a little water and steam till tender. 
While steaming, prick with a fork every little while to let out 
the oil. When ready, take out and stuff the same as turkey and 
set in oven. Cook slowly 2 hours, basting every few minutes. 

Carving 

To carve well, a good knife of moderate size and great sharp- 
ness is a necessity. Fowls are easily carved. In roasts such as 
loins, breasts, fore-quarters, etc., the butcher should always have 
instructions to separate the joints. The platter should be placed 
so near to the carver that he has full control over it; if far off 
nothing can prevent an ungraceful appearance. In carving a tur- 
key, place the head to the right, cut off the wing nearest you first, 
then the leg and second joint; then slice the breast until a round 
ivory-shaped piece appears ; insert the knife between that and the 
bone and separate them ; this part is the nicest bit of the breast ; 
next comes the "merry thought." After this, turn over the bird 
a little, and just below the breast you will find the "oyster," which 
you can separate as you did the inner breast. The side bone lies 
beside the rump, and the desired morsel can be taken out without 
separating the whole bone. Proceed in the same way upon the 
other side. The fork need not be removed during the whole pro- 
cess. An experienced carver will dissect a fowl as easily as you 
can break an egg or cut a potato. He retains his seat, manages 
his hands and elbows artistically, and is perfectly at his ease. 

A fillet of veal is cut in thin, smooth slices off the top, and por- 
tions of the stuffing and fat are served to each. In cutting a 
breast of veal, separate the breast and brisket, and then cut them 
up. 

24 




Ham 

A ham may be carved three ways : First, by cutting long deli- 
cate slices, through the thick fat from 1 to 2, down to the bone ; 
secondly, by running the point of the knife in the middle, and cut- 
ting thin circular slices, thus keeping the ham moist ; and last, and 
most economically, by beginning at the knuckle, 4 to 5, and slic- 
ing upward. 




Leg of Mutton 

In carving a leg of mutton the best slices are obtained from the 
center, by cutting from 1 to 2 ; and some very good cuts are found 
on the broad end from 5 to 6. Some epicures prefer slices nearer 
the knuckle, but they are dry. The cramp bone is a delicacy, and 
is obtained by cutting down to the bone at 4, and running the 
knife under it in a semicircular direction to 3. The fat so 
esteemed by many lies on the ridge 5. By turning over the meat 
some excellent slices are found, and can be cut lengthwise. 




Tongue 

A tongue may be carved as "thin as a wafer," its deiicacy de- 
pending in a great degree upon that. A well-cut tongue tempts 
the most fastidious ; and this applies, in fact, to all kinds of roast 
and boiled meats. A chunk of beef we turn from with disgust ; 

25 



an artistic slice we enjoy. The center slices of the tongue are 
considered the best, and should be cut across at the line 1, and 
the slices taken from each side, with a portion of the fat which 
is at the root, if it is liked. The question should be asked. 




Sirloin of Beef 

In carving beef, mutton, lamb, and veal, thin, smooth, and neat 
slices are desirable â€” cut across the grain, taking care to pass the 
knife through to the bones of the meat. There are two modes 
of helping a sirloin of beef ; either by carving long, thin slices 
from 3 to 4, and helping it with a bit of the fat underneath the 
ribs, or by cutting thicker slices, from 1 to 2, through the tender- 
loin. 




Shoulder of Mutton 

A shoulder of mutton should be cut down to the bone, in the 
direction of the line 1, and then thin slices of lean taken from 
each side. The best fat is found at 2, and should be cut in thin 
slices in that direction. Several tempting slices can be cut on 
either side of the line 3, and there are nice bits on the under side 
near the flap.

VEGETABLES 

Vegetables, like fruits, contain mineral salts important to 
health. Too many cooks think only of getting vegetables soft, 
without regard to retaining their juices and salts. Vegetables 
cooked in water lose a large proportion of their foodstuffs. 

When selecting vegetables in the market, choose only those that 
are in season. Choose medium sized or small vegetables. Large 
vegetables are usually old and woody ; they require more fuel to 
cook them and are less nutritious than younger ones. Large 
squashes and cucumbers are seedy ; corn with large kernels is 
tough. Stale or wilted vegetables are never economical and are 
unwholesome. 

If you get your vegetables from the garden, gather them when 
the dew is on them. 

Cook vegetables whole when practicable, or cut them into as 
large pieces as convenient. Use only as much water as is neces- 
sary to cover the vegetable. For small or cut-up vegetables, that 
can be stirred, use just enough to keep them from burning, adding 
more as this cooks away. 

Green vegetables keep their color better if cooked uncovered. 
Cook onions and cabbage uncovered ; their odor is less noticeable. 

The time required to cook any vegetable depends on its age, 
size and freshness. Old beets may be woody so that they cannot 
be cooked tender. 

Asparagus 

Stalks should be green; the ends should show that they have 
been recently cut. To keep for a short time, stand ends in cold 
water. 

Cut stalks off as far down as they are brittle. Untie the 
bunches, wash stalks and retie them in bunches right to serve to 
one person. Tie these into one bunch again and stand in cold 
water till put on to cook. 

Stand the asparagus in a deep kettle and pour in boiling water 
to cover all but the tips. Let it boil tightly covered till the stalks 
are tender. The steam will cook the heads. Cook for about 45 
minutes. Drain, butter, and. serve on strips of buttered toast. 

Lima Beans 

Buy green, with juicy pods and small veined beans. Wash and 
shell. Cook uncovered in barely enough water to cover them. 
Let the water boil down when nearly done and add salt to taste. 

27 



Cook from ] to 13^ hours and serve without draining. Season 
with butter and pepper. 

Potatoes 

Potatoes must be cooked till soft all through. Rapidly boiling 
water wears off the outside of the potato before the inside is 
cooked. Let it bubble gently. Potatoes baked in a slow oven 
become dry and hard. Quickly baked potatoes are more easily 
digested than boiled potatoes. 

Mashed Potato 

Mash in the kettle in which the potatoes were cooked. When 
free from lumps, add for each pint of mashed potato : 

1 tbsp. melted butter ^4 to ^ tsp. salt 

3 tbsp. scalded milk Pinch of pepper " 

Beat all together till light and creamy. Heap in a dish without 
smoothing the top; or put in a baking dish, brush the top with 
milk and brown in a hot oven. 

Stuffed Potatoes 

Roast large potatoes (one to each person). Cut in halves 
lengthwise and take out the pulp, being careful not to break 
the skins. Mash in a bowl and mix with salt and pepper and a 
little milk or cream. Put the pulp back in the skins, score with 
a fork or put it back with a potato ricer. Brush with milk or 
egg, set in the oven and brown on top. 

Stuffed Peppers 

Cut green peppers in two lengthwise. Remove every seed 
carefully and soak the peppers in cold water for half an hour. 
Dry them and fill with a stuffing made from bread crumbs, sea- 
soned with sage, onion juice, pepper and salt. Chopped meat may 
be added if desired. Place in buttered pan and bake till brown 
on top, moistening once or twice with melted butter. 

Baked Beans 

Soak 3 cups white beans over night in cold water. Pour off 
water in the morning and cover with cold water. Boil until skins 
pop open when blown upon ; pour off that water and cover with 
boiling water; add 3 tablespoons molasses, 1 teaspoon salt, 54 
teaspoon soda, % teaspoon mustard and a piece of pork. Bake all 
day in a slow oven, being sure not to let bake dry. 

Baked Tomatoes 

Wipe and remove a thin slice from the stem end of 6 ripe 
tomatoes. Take out seeds and pulp and drain off most of the 
liquid. Add an equal quantity of cracker crumbs with the pulp 

28 



and season with salt and pepper and a little onion juice. Refill 
the tomatoes with the mixture and bake in a buttered pan for 20 
minutes in a hot oven. Sprinkle tomatoes with buttered crumbs 
before baking. 

Stuffed Tomatoes and Rice 

Select firm, ripe tomatoes of even size, cut a slice from the top 
of each and scoop out the center. Boil 2 tablespoons of rice in 1 
quart of boiling water for 10 minutes, then drain ; melt 2 table- 
spoons butter in a small pan, add a few bits of chopped onion, 
also 1 or 2 green peppers, (according to size and taste after the 
seeds have been removed). After frying the onion and pepper 
in the butter for about 5 minutes add the scooped part of the 
tomato and rice; season with salt and pepper. Fill the tomatoes 
with this mixture and place in a buttered pan with the open tops 
of the tomatoes down. Brush over with melted butter and bake 
about 25 minutes. 

Cauliflower 

Select a close, white cauliflower, trim off decayed leaves and cut 
stalk off flat at bottom. Open the flower a little in places to re- 
move insects which are generally found near the stalk. Let lie 
with head downward in salted water for about 2 hours to remove 
all vermin. Then put in boiling water, salted and boil briskly 
for 15 or 20 minutes, keeping the sauce pan uncovered. The 
water should be well skimmed. When the cauliflower is tender, 
take up, drain, and stand upright in a dish. Pour a thin white 
sauce over it or it may be served with plain melted butter. Cauli- 
flower makes a good garnish for chicken or sweetbreads. 

Dandelions 

They are fit for use until they blossom. Cut off the leaves, pick 
over carefully and wash in several waters. Put in boiling water 
and boil one hour. Drain well and boil two hours in salted boiling 
water. Drain, season with butter and more salt if needed and 
cut with a knife ; or boil with a piece of salt pork and omit the 
butter in the dressing. 

String Beans 

The pod should be brittle, the string should be delicate and the 
beans very small. Wash, pull off the strings and snap or cut the 
pods into inch pieces. Cook in barely enough water to cover, 
letting this boil down when the beans are nearly cooked. Salt 
when nearly done. For young beans cook 1 hour; for old ones, 
3 to 3 hours. Serve without draining and season with butter and 
pepper. 

Com 

The silk should be brown. Remove outer husks as soon as it 
comes from the market. Cook as soon as possible as corn is 

29 



injured by keeping. Cook in boiling water from 5 to 15 minutes. 
If cooked in salted water the corn will become wrinkled and 
hardened. 

Beets 

Choose those with dirty roots and fresh, green, leaves. If the 
roots are clean, the beets have probably wilted and been freshened 
by soaking. Wash, taking care not to break the skin. Cut tops 
off about 2 inches above the root. If cut short the beets will lose 
color and sweetness. Cook in boiling water 1 hour for young 
beets, 4 or 5 hours for old ones. Rub off the skins with a dry 
cloth. Slice large beets, quarter small ones. Season with butter, 
salt, and pepper. 

Cabbage 

Choose a hard, heavy one with crisp, white, leaves, and stalk 
cut close to the head. Remove outer leaves, cut out stalk, and 
separate inner leaves, removing any insects found. Cook un- 
covered in boiling salted water for about 20 minutes or until tender 
but not sodden. Drain, and season with butter, salt and pepper 
or mix with a thin white sauce. 

Summer Carrots 

Wash and scrape, and drop into cold water. Cook in boiling 
water from 30 minutes to an hour. Serve in a thin white sauce 
or with green peas. 

Winter Carrots 

Wash and scrape and cut into half-inch cubes. Cook in a small 
quantity of boiling water for 20 or 30 minutes and serve in a 
thin white sauce. Peas and carrot cubes are a good garnish for 
meat. 

Peas 

See that the pods are green and brittle and the peas green. 
Cook as soon as possible. Peas are injured by keeping. Wash 
the pods before shelling and cook in barely enough water to cover 
them, adding salt 15 minutes before taking from the fire. Let 
the water boil down when peas are nearly cooked. Serve without 
draining; season with butter and pepper. Should the peas lack 
sweetness, add ^^ to 1 teaspoon sugar to each half peck of peas 
while cooking. 

Spinach 

Choose spinach with leaves that are fresh and dirty. If clean 
they have wilted and been soaked to revive them. Cut off roots, 
stems and poor leaves; wash by lifting from one pan of cold 
water to another till water is free from sand. Cook in its own 
juices, heating it gradually till these are drawn out. Cook for 
about 15 minutes. Rather old spinach may be better cooked in 
water and dramed. Season with butter, salt and pepper. 

80 



Summer Squash 

The shell should be tender enough to be broken with the finger 
nail. Wash, cut into pieces and pare. Cook in a steamer or a 
strainer over boihng water fo-r 30 minutes. Mash, season with 
butter, salt and pepper. If very watery, press out juice by 
squeezing between the colander and the plate* 

Winter Squash* 

Choose sound ones with no- soft spots. If you buy a quantity, 
keep spread out in a dry place. Break into pieces, take out shreds 
and seeds ; and steam like summer squash for about 40 minutes. 
Scoop out inner part. Rub through a colander, and season with 
butter, salt and pepper. 

Tomatoes 

The best ones are firm, smooth and evenly red, with no decayed, 
bruised or green spots. Let them stand in boiling water for one 
minute to loosen the skins. Peel and cut into pieces. Simmer 
them for about 20 minutes and add for each pint of tomatoes, 
1 tbsp. butter, 14 tsp. salt, a few grains of pepper, and 1 or 3 tsp. 
sugar. To thicken, stir in 2 tbsp. of sifted cracker crumbs, or 
omit the crumbs and serve on buttered toast. 

Macaroni 

Break macaroni into inch pieces. Boil until soft in salted water. 
Drain and rinse in cold water over a colander to separate the 
macaroni and to prevent sticking together. Place in a dish and 
pour hot white sauce over it. Season with butter, salt, and pepper, 

Italian, Spaghetti 

1 lb. spaghetti 1 Spanish onion 1 tbsp. sugar 

1 can tomato 1 green pepper with seeds 1 dash red pepper 
1 crumb garlic removed Butter size of walnut 

Boil spaghetti until tender. Make sauce of above ingredients, 
pour over spaghetti, and bake for 30 minutes.

SALADS 

While the food value of a green salad is not large, the salts it 
supplies, and its appetizing qualities, make it a very wholesome 
food. The oil or butter used in dressing it furnishes fat in a 
digestible form. The acid vinegar is a great aid to digestion. 
If you cannot have salad every day, have it as often as you can. 
Some people now have salad instead of dessert, and if you cannot 
have both at the same dinner it is well to substitute salad for a 
pudding two or three times a week at least. 

By using originality and invention, one can produce many a 
salad not described in cook books, but delightful to eye and taste. 

Cooked Salad Dressing (without oil) 

^ tsp. mustard 1 tsp. sugar 

Yi. tsp. salt Yoke of one ^gg 

Few grains of cayenne ^ cup milk 

2 tsp. flour 2 tsp. melted butter 

y^ cup hot vinegar 

Mix the dry ingredients in a saucepan, stir in the yolk of ^gg, 
butter and milk. Stir the mixture over hot water until it begins 
to thicken, then stir in the vinegar, a few drops at a time. When 
as thick as cream, strain and cool. 

Cream Salad Dressing 

2 eggs well beaten 1 tsp. salt 

1 tbsp. sugar ^ cup of vinegar 

1 tsp. mustard 1 tbsp. melted butter 

Cook in a double boiler until creamy. Cool and add Yt. cup of 
whipped cream. 

Emergency Salad Dressing 

1 tsp. dry mustard Y^ tsp. pepper 

Yz tsp. salt 1 or 2 tsp. sugar 

Add very slowly 1 cup of cream, working it gradually with the 
dry ingredients. Now add, also by degrees, 1 tablespoon vinegar 
or more if liked, stirring well. Make just before using. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

Yolk of one ^gg, beat, adding all the while a few drops of oil 
at a time. When it grows thick and stiff the oil may be added 
faster till desired amount of dressing is obtained. Add lemon 
juice and salt to taste. 

38 



Mayonnaise Dressing 

Yolks of 2 eggs well beaten, 1 teaspoon yellow mustard, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 1 tablespoon flour, pinch of sugar, and a pinch of cay- 
enne pepper. Rub all together until light. Add ^ cup of sour 
cream or sweet milk will do and ^ cup of vinegar. Put over a 
fire until it comes to a boil. Stir constantly. Take from fire and 
add butter the size of an egg and beat well. When cold, add 
olive oil to taste for chicken salad ; for salmon or fish salad, add 
lemon juice, and for vegetable salad add equal parts of whipped 
cream. 

Mayonnaise Dressing for Two 

Break the yolk of a fresh egg into a small deep bowl and add 
4 tablespoons salad oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, ^ teaspoon salt. 
Whip with an egg beater 1 minute. 

French Dressing 

4 tbsp. salad oil /^ tsp. salt 

1 tbsp. lemon juice ^ tsp. pepper 

Put salt and pepper in a bowl and stir oil into it until it is 
dissolved. Add lemon juice and stir until it thickens. This 
dressing must be used at once. 

Tomato and Cheese Salad 

Mash cream cheese and moisten with sweet cream, season with

BREAD AND ROLLS 

White Bread 

3 or 3)^2 cups flour 2 tbsp. lukewarm water 

Yi cup cold water ^ cake compressed yeast 

Yz cup milk Yz tsp, salt 

Scald the milk; sift and measure the flour; put the salt in a 
bowl and pour the milk on it. Add the cold water, then the yeast 
mixed thoroughly and smoothly with the warm water. After 
stirring all together, stir in enough flour to make a drop batter. 
Beat this batter until it is full of bubbles ; then beat in gradually 
enough more flour to make a rather soft dough. When too stiff 
to beat, rub a little flour on the molding board, and turn the dough 
out. 

Dust a little flour on the dough and on the palms of the hands. 
Fold the edge of the dough farthest from you toward the center 
of the mass, immediately pressing the dough down and away 
from you with a gentle rolling motion with the palms of the hands, 
twice repeated. Turn the dough so that what was the right-hand 
part of it will be farthest away from you ; fold over and knead 
as before ; continue to do this, turning the dough and flouring the 
hands, the board, and the dough, to keep the batter from sticking. 
Should it stick to the board, scrape it free with a dull knife, and 
flour the board anew. Knead the dough until it does not stick 
to your hands or the board, and is smooth on the surface and 
feels spongy and elastic. It should rise quickly after being in- 
dented. 

Replace the dough ball in the bowl, brush the top with water, 
cover the bowl with several thicknesses of cloth and set it near 
the stove or in a pan of warm water, turning another pan over it. 

When the dough has risen to twice its original bulk, lift it on 
the board and shape into small loaves, handling lightly and using 
little or no flour. Put into pans, and let it stand in a warm place 
covered with a thick, clean cloth, until it has again doubled in bulk. 

When nearly risen, test the oven ; it should be hot enough to 
turn a piece of writing paper brown in 6 minutes. Bake small 
French loaves 35 minutes ; brick loaves, 4 inches thick, 50 to 60 
minutes. Turn the pans if the bread does not bake evenly.

pull off pieces the size of an egg; draw up and pinch the edges 
together, forming balls; then with your hand roll each into a 
cylindrical shape on the board. Put into French roll pans, let 
rise until more than doubled in bulk, and bake from 12 to 15 
minutes. Or, put the balls on a flat pan, and when they have risen,

together until well mixed. Bake by spoonfuls on a hot griddle. 

41 



When the cakes are full of bubbles on top, and brown on one side, 
turn them over with a broad knife or cake turner. If large 
bubbles rise in the top at once, the griddle is too hot. If the top 
of the cake stiffens before the under side is brown, the griddle is 
not hot enough. Never turn a cake twice ; a twice turned cake 
will be heavy. 

Serve the cakes as soon as they are baked, piled (not more than 
six to eight together) on a hot plate. Serve with butter and 
syrup, or butter and sugar. 

In making griddle cakes with sweet milk, omit the soda, and add 
2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 tablespoon of melted butter.

CROQUETTES, FRITTERS AND 
PATTIES 

Articles of food to be fried are usually covered with egg and 
crumbs, flour or meal, to protect them from absorbing the fat. 
Use a deep frying pan or kettle. A wire frying basket to hold 
the articles to be fried, hung on a long handle fork, is convenient ; 
but they may be lowered into the fat with a wire egg beater. Put 
the fat into a cold kettle and bring it to the right degree of heat. 
Have several sheets of soft paper ready on a pan, also a pan to 
hold under the food as it is taken from the fat. When the fat 
begins to smoke, drop into it an inch cube of white bread. If 
this becomes a golden brown in forty seconds, it is right for cro- 
quettes and other articles of cooked material, and for fish and 
oysters. If it takes sixty seconds, it is right for fritters and most 
other uncooked articles. Three croquettes can be fried at once 
in a three-quart saucepan. More will cool the fat below the 
soaking point. When all the grease has been absorbed by the 
paper, arrange the food on a platter, and garnish with parsley; 
in the case of fish or oysters, with parsley and lemon. 

Chicken Croquettes 

2 cups chicken, chopped fine 1 tsp. onion juice 
1 cup thick white sauce Few grains grated nutmeg

cones, roll in egg and bread crumbs, and fry in deep fat. Stick 
a small sprig of parsley in each one. They may be served with 
white sauce poured around them. 

Potato Croquettes 

2 cups mashed potato Pinch of pepper 

2 tbsp. butter % tsp. celery salt 

5^2 tsp. salt 10 drops onion juice 

1 egg 
Beat the egg, mix it with the potato and add the other ingredi- 
ents. Heat the mixture in a saucepan, stirring, and when it 
cleaves from the sides of the pan turn out on a flat dish. When 
cold, shape into cylinders 3 inches long. Roll in egg and crumbs 
and fry.

BREAKFAST AND LUNCHEON 
DISHES 

Cereals 

Cereals are the most important of vegetable foods. Oatmeal 
and cornmeal, having more fat than other grains, are good winter 
foods. On account of its strong and indigestible fiber, oatmeal 
is less nutritious than other grains except for strong, hard-work- 
ing people. 

Cereals should absorb all the water they are cooked in. If too 
moist when nearly done, cook uncovered for a time. 

To improve rice, farina, or hominy, stir in ^4 cup of milk about 
15 minutes before taking from the fire and leave the cover off 
during the rest of the time. 

It is better not to eat cereals at all than to eat them under 
cooked. Sugar, a heat giver, is not needed with cereals ; milk and 
cream, on the other hand, supply fat and substances, of which 
cereals have little. 

Whole Oatmeal 

1 cup oatmeal 4 cups water 

1 tsp. salt 
Put the water with the salt in the upper part of the double 
boiler and set it directly over the heat. When it boils, stir in the 
oatmeal, put the parts of the boiler together and cook over night 
or 6 hours by a day fire. Reheat in the morning. 

Steamed Oatmeal 

Soak the oatmeal in the water for several hours, add the salt 
and steam 3 hours. 

Hominy 

1 cup hominy 4 cups water 

1 tsp. salt 
Put the water and the salt together and bring to a boil. Stir 
in the hominy and steam 4 hours. 

Rice Omelet 

3 eggs 1 tbsp. butter 

1 cup milk 1 tbsp. flour

this to a pint of cooked rice. Bake 30 minutes. 

47 



Glorified Eggs 

4 eggs 1 cup milk 

1 tsp. salt Butter size of walnut 

Beat the eggs until light, add the other ingredients and put in 
a double boiler. Do not stir. When mixture is firm it is ready 
to serve. Turn on a hot platter and serve at once. 

French Omelet 

4 eggs Yi tsp. salt 

4 tbsp. water Few grains pepper 

1 tbsp. butter 

Beat the eggs lightly, add water, salt and pepper. Melt the 
butter in a hot omelet pan without letting it brown. Turn in the 
eggs, shake the pan gently, and as the ^gg thickens, lift it lightly 
with a fork or knife letting the uncooked part run underneath. 
The omelet should slip on the pan without sticking anywhere. 
When creamy all through roll it up, rolling toward the left side 
of the pan. Hold a hot platter over the edge of the pan and turn 
the pan and the platter over so that the omelet will fall in the 
center of the platter. Garnish with parsley and serve at once. 

Omelet 

5 eggs, yokes and whites 1 tbsp. flour mixed smoothly 

beaten separately with a little milk

BEVERAGES 

Value of Tea 

While not nutritious, tea is a useful food adjunct, because it 
prevents tissue from wearing out. 

1. Buy good tea ; cheap tea is likely to be adulterated with 
used tea leaves and leaves of other plants. 2. Keep it in a closely 
covered glass jar or tin canister ; if exposed to the air it loses 
flavor. 3. Use a china, or silver, or earthen teapot ; never a tin 
one. 4. Have the water freshly drawn, and bring it quickly to 
the boiling point, water deprived of its air by standing or by 
boiling gives tea a flat taste. 5. Steep it not over five minutes ; 
Never let it boil. 

Directions for Making Tea 

Allow from 1 to 3 teaspoons of tea to 3 cups of water, using 
less of close-rolled than of coarse, loose teas. When the water 
boils, scald the pot, put in the tea, and pour in the boiling water, 
and let it stand covered from 3 to 5 minutes on the side of the 
stove or under a cosy on the table. 

Iced Tea, made weak, is a wholesome summer drink. Serve it 
strained, with lemon and powdered sugar. 

French Tea 

Add % teaspoon of brandy to each cup of tea and serve with 
lemon. 

Russian Tea 

To 1 quart of cold tea add the juice of 2 large lemons ; pour in 
glasses supplied with cracked ice and sugar to taste. This is a 
very cooling drink for hot weather, and satisfies the thirst as few 
beverages do. 

Value of Coffee 

Coffee, like tea, contains tannin and theine (generally called 
caffeine in coffee) ; it acts, therefore, much as tea does upon the 
body, and requires similar preparation. The difference in flavor 
and odor between coffee and tea is caused by a difference in the 
aromatic oils they contain. Moderately strong coffee in moderate 
quantities seems to be not harmful to grown persons in good 
health, but it is unsuitable for boys and girls for the same reasons 
that tea is. 

1. Buy freshly roasted, unground coffee, and grind it at home 
as needed ; or buy it freshly ground every two or three days. 2. 
Keep it in an airtight can or jar. 3. Use an enameled or earthen 

67 



coffeepot that is scoured clean, not omitting the spout, after each 
using. 4. Either filter the coffee, or boil it not longer than three 
minutes. 5. Have coffee powdered for filtering, finely ground for 
boiling. Serve with hot, but not scalded, milk. 

Directions for Making Coffee 

Use 2 heaping tablespoons of coffee to 1 pint of boiling water. 
Put the coffee into the pot, pour on the water, and let it come again 
to the boihng point. Set it away from the heat, and stir in 2 
tablespoons of slightly beaten egg. Let it boil for 1 minute to 
clear it; then keep it hot, where it will not boil, for 5 minutes 
before serving 

Filtered Coffee 

Use a French coffee-pot. Put 2 heaping tablespoons of 
powdered coffee into the bag. Pour over it 1 pint of boiling 
water. Cover the pot and let it stand in hot water till the water 
poured in has filtered through. Pour it out, and turn it through 
the filter again. This makes black coffee, suitable for serving in 
small cups after dinner. Make breakfast coffee less strong. 

Value of Cocoa 

Linnseus, the great botanist, named cocoa theobroma, "food of 
the Gods." Roasted cocoa contains about 50 per cent of fat, 15 
to 16 per cent of nitrogenous compounds, and 10 to 13 per cent 
of starch. For children and young people, it is the best of hot 
drinks. 

Breakfast Cocoa 

1 pint scalded milk 2 tbsp. prepared cocoa 

2 to 4 tbsp. sugar 1 pint boiling water 

Mix the cocoa and sugar in a saucepan ; stir in the water 
gradually, and boil 5 minutes ; add the milk and cook for 5 minutes 
longer, or until smooth and free from any raw taste. Beat well 
to prevent albuminous skin from forming. 

Chocolate 

2 squares chocolate 1 cup boiling water 

4 tbsp. sugar 3 sups scalded milk 

Put the chocolate cut in bits into a saucepan set into hot water ; 
when melted, add the sugar and water, stirring till smooth. Pour 
into this part of the milk, then pour the chocolate back into the 
rest of the milk, and stir until it comes to the boiling point. Beat 
till frothy with an egg-whisk. 

For luncheon or for afternoon tea, serve in tall cups with a 
spoonful of whipped cream on the top of each cup.

to 1 quart of juice put 2 quarts of white wine and bottle it. It 
will be fit to drink in a week.

CAKES 

"With weights and measures just and true. 
With stoves of even heat; 
Well buttered tins, and quiet nerves, 
Success will be complete." 

Cake is rich bread, some cakes being richer than others, that 
is, having more butter, sugar, and eggs, in proportion to the flour. 
All cakes belong to one of two classes, butter cakes and sponge 
cakes. Several kinds of cake can easily be made from one recipe, 
by varying the flavorings, spices, and fruits, by baking the mix- 
ture in pans of dififerent shapes, by frosting the cake, or by leav- 
ing it plain. In mixing butter cakes, cream the butter and sugar 
thoroughly ; unless they become partially liquefied before the 
other ingredients are added, the cake will be coarse grained, per- 
haps heavy. Add the yolks of the eggs, beaten slightly, then a 
little of the milk, then part of the flour with the other dry ingredi- 
ents sifted with it, a little more milk, and so on until all the flour 
and milk is stirred in, taking care to keep the mixture the same 
degree of stiffness. Fold in the whites beaten very stiff. Add 
the flavoring and beat the mixture well. If fruit is to be added, 
fold it in, well floured, last of all. 

In mixing sponge cakes, beat the yolks till thick and lemon 
colored. Beat the sugar into them, add the flavoring (and other 
liquid if the recipe calls for any). Beat the whites till stiff and 
dry ; slip them into the mixing bowl ; sift the flour over them and 
fold all together. Sponge cake beaten after the flour is added will 
be close and tough. 

In mixing molasses cakes, mix milk and molasses and stir them 
into the flour. Add soda last, sifted with a little flour reserved for 
this purpose. Fruit must be well floured and added last or it 
will sink to the bottom of the loaf. 

The oven should be less hot for cake than for bread. When 
a cake is done, it shrinks from the pan and a small tooth pick run 
in it comes out clean. Take it at once from the pan and set it 
on a clean towel or sieve to cool. 

Use only the best materials in making cake. Otherwise the 
cake will not pay for the trouble of making it. See that the fire 
is arranged so that the oven will be hot by the time the cake is 
mixed. Cake containing molasses burns easily. Bake such cakes 

71 



and any thick loaves requiring long baking in tins lined with 
greased paper. If the cake browns in 15 minutes, the heat is too 
great. Reduce it or make a tent of brown paper over the pan. A 
pan of water put in the oven will reduce the heat.

CANNING 

We do well to take a lesson from the bees, and in the long 
summer days to store up food for the winter. If we can kill the 
bacteria in food, and then seal it up so that no more can get in, it 
will keep indefinitely. This we do in canning. 

Canning 

Can each fruit in its season, when it is best and cheapest. Select 
it under-ripe rather than over-ripe. To insure success in preserv- 
ing it observe carefully the following directions. 

Preparing the Jars 

For a small family use the pint jars. Buy jars with tight-fitting 
covers, and fit them each year with new rubber rings. Old rubber 
becomes porous, and lets in the air. Fit each jar with a ring and a 
cover ; pour water into them, and invert them to see if they are 
airtight. If not, do not use them. Sterilize jars and covers by 
placing them in a dishpan of cold water and letting this slowly 
come to the boiling point, and boil fifteen minutes. 

Preparing for Cooking Fruit 

Strawberries. Wash and hull the berries ; weigh them, and add 
one-third of a pound of sugar for every pound of fruit. Let them 
stand for 45 minutes or longer. Cook the berries slowly until the 
juice is thick and syrupy, and the berries soft. Remove the scum 
as it rises. 

Peaches. Pare the peaches, dropping them into cold water. 
Make a syrup, allowing 1 cup of water and 1 pound of sugar to 3 
pounds of peaches ; boil it 15 minutes. Cut peaches in two, stone 
them, and put peaches and stones into the syrup. The flavor of 
peaches is improved by cooking the stones with them. Cook the 
fruit until, when tried with a knitting needle, it is found to be 
soft. 

Pears, Cherries, Apples and Plums may be canned like peaches. 

Directions for filling jars 

Remove the jars from the boiling water, and stand them on a 
cloth wet in boiling water. Place a silver spoon in the jar to be 
filled first. Silver, being a good conductor of heat, absorbs heat 
from the fruit, thus further lessening the risk of the jar's break- 
ing. Dip a rubber ring into the boiling water (to sterilize it), and 
place it on the jar. Dip a silver spoon into boiling water, and with 
it filled the jar with fruit; then fill the jar to overflowing with 
syrup. With the handle of the spoon press the fruit away from 
the side of the jar, that any air-bubbles between may escape. Put 



on the cover, and screw it tight. Turn the jar upside down; if 
syrup oozes out, remove cover and rubber, put on another rubber, 
refill with boiling syrup, and again screw down the cover. The 
jars must be sealed airtight. 

Spiced Currants with Raisins 

3 lbs. sugar 5 lbs. currants 

1 pint vinegar 1 lb. seeded raisins 

Make a syrup of the sugar and vinegar and skim. Boil J^ hour 
and add 1 tablespoon cinnamon and y^ tablespoon each of cloves, 
allspice and nutmeg. 

Tomato Butter 

7 lbs. ripe tomatoes 1 oz. ground cinnamon 

3 lbs. sugar J^ oz. ground cloves 

1 pint cider vinegar 

Boil 3 hours, or until rich and thick. It should keep without 
sealing. 

For Canning Blackberries, Blueberries, Red Raspberries, 
and Strawberries. 

Prepare the jars the same as for other preserves. Pick over 
the fruit very carefully. Fill each can with the fruit ; add one cup 
of sugar to each can. Be sure that the sugar is dissolved in hot 
water or it will settle in the bottom of the jar. Fill each can with 
water, placing the cover on and seal without rubber. Put little 
blocks of wood in the bottom of the boiler setting the jars on them. 
Let them boil for about Yz hour. After they have boiled remove 
covers, put on the rubbers and seal tight. 

Peaches may be canned in this way also. Tomatoes may be 
canned in this way without any sugar. 

For Canning Cranberries 

Pick the berries over very carefully and see that the jars are 
clean. Fill the jars with berries and fill with cold water. After 
this is done set the jars away. 

Rhubarb may be canned in the same way. 

Canning Tomatoes 

Select small, round, smooth tomatoes : scald and peel them. 
Pack them in sterilized jars and fill the jars with boiling water. 
Sterilize the covers and put them on without screwing down. 
Set the jars on small blocks of wood in a kettle of cold water, 
and let the water heat slowly for 15 minutes. Remove the covers, 
fill the jars to overflowing with boiling water, put on the rubber 
rings, and screw the covers down. 

84 



Canned Beets 

To 1 quart of vinegar use 1 cup of sugar. Fill can with hot 
sliced beets and cover with the hot vinegar and seal. If the 
vinegar is too strong use a little water. 

Canned S'weet Corn- 
Take 9 cups of sweet corn cut from the cobs, H cup sugar, % 
cup salt, 1 pint of water. Boil hard for 5 minutes. Put up m air- 
tight cans. The corn should soak before using or rinse 3 or 3 
times while cooking. 

To Prepare Pineapple 
Pare and slice lengthwise. Cover parings and cores with hot 
water, cook slowly 1 hour. Add 1 cup of sugar to each piece. 
Strain juice and let boil, then pour over pineappl^. Set away to 
cool. This improves by standing a day. 
Spiced Rhubarb 
3 lbs. rhubarb 1 tbsp. ground cloves 

2 lbs. sugar 1 tbsp. cinnamon 

1 cup vinegar 
Cut the rhubarb in inch pieces, mix other ingredients with it 
and bring slowly to a boil. Boil fast for 30 minutes, pour into 
jelly glasses. 

Grape Conserve 
5 lbs. grapes 3 oranges 

5 lbs. sugar 1 lemon 

1 lb. seeded raisins Grated rind and juice 

y2 lb. walnut meats 
Pulp grapes, cook pulp to remove seeds, then strain. Add skins 
and cook 15 minutes. To this add sugar, oranges, lemon and 
raisins. Boil 1 hour. Add chopped nuts 1/2 hour before it is done. 
Put the raisins and oranges through the food chopper. 

Canning Fruit without Sugar 

Rhubarb and gooseberries may be canned without cooking 
because they are so acid. 

Rhubarb. Wash and peel the rhubarb if tough (if tender, do 
not remove the skins), and cut into inch-length pieces. Pack the 
sterilized and cooled jars full of the fruit and place each under 
the cold water spigot. Let the water run into the jars with as 
much force as possible for 10 to 15 minutes to expel the air, then 
cover and fasten as tightly as possible. Be sure that the jar is 
filled to the very brim with water to drive out all air bubbles. 
Let the jars stand for a few hours, then tighten again, and put 
away in the preserve closets. 

Gooseberries should be topped and tailed before canning, but 
are canned in exactly the same way as rhubarb. 

Cranberries, which are so plentiful in the late fall and winter, 
may be kept in the same way as rhubarb and gooseberries.

Reviving an Ancient Custom â€” Drying Viegetables 
and Fruits 

In the days of our foremothers, the drying of vegetables and 
fruits was a much more common process than canning and pre- 
serving, and in these times, when every possible means of con- 
servation of food is being urged, it is well for housewives to 
understand the method of drying. 

Vegetables lend themselves especially well to drying because 
of the small percentage of moisture. By the removing of this 
small amount of water, vegetables may be kept almost indefi- 
nitely. 

Drying vegetables require air. If not dried in a current of 
air, at least give them as much as possible during the process. 
Place the vegetables on small meshed wire trays, or in large 
shallow tin pans. Place trays in a cold oven. When the ther- 
mometer registers 120 degrees F., open the door half an inch, 
and keep the oven at not more than 125 degrees for two hours. 
Then raise it gradually to 140 degrees, and finish drying. Turn 
the vegetables once or twice during the drying process. Peas will 
be dry enough in about seven hours. It is far better to accom- 
plish the work slowly and gradually than to attempt to hurry it. 
Small vegetables like peas and lima beans will dry more quickly 
than potatoes and carrots. The latter should be sliced before 
drying. Apples and peaches, also sweet potatoes, are excellent 
when sliced and dried. 

When finished place the vegetables in airtight receptacles and 
keep in a dry place. 



Quinces 

Wash and wipe the quinces, pare and core, saving the peel. 
Then cut into quarters. Drop each piece into cold water to pre- 
vent discoloration. When all are ready, place them in a preserv- 
ing kettle and cover with cold water. Simmer very gently till 
tender. Lift from the water with a skimmer, and add the parings 
to the water. Cook them for half an hour, keeping them closely 
covered. Then strain and measure the liquid. Allow a pound 
of sugar to a pint and cook 10 minutes, skimming often. Add 
the quinces and simmer them until they are clear and tender and 
a rich red. By keeping the kettle covered the quinces will be a 
much brighter color. When clear and transparent, lift carefully 
from the syrup and place in jars. Boil the syrup a few moments 
longer and pour over the fruit. 

86 



Canning Corn on the Cob 

Pack corn on cob in two-quart jars and fill with cold water, 
shaking until no bubbles rise, add 1 teaspoon salt, fill the jars to 
running over with cold water, put on rubber and cover but do 
not screw tight. Set the jars on a rack in a boiler of cold water 
and boil five hours, adding more water as it boils away. Seal 
tight, and set away in cool dry place. 

String beans, whole, may be canned the same way. Choose 
small tender ones. 

Canned Asparagus 

Wash it well, scrape stocks, and cut off tough ends, and can 
same as corn. 

Canned Spinach 

Wash the spinach, rinse it thoroughly in several waters, then 
cook it in a very small quantity of salted water as for the table. 
When tender, pack into sterilized hot jars, and force down with 
a spoon. Pour the water from the spinach, or boiling water, into 
the jar until it overflows, then adjust rubbers, seal and cook for 
1% hours, in jars. Fasten tops and set away. 

Canned dandelions, beet greens and szviss chard are prepared 
as above. 

Canned Beets, Carrots and Turnips 

Choose young vegetables, wash well but do not peel them. 
Cover with boiling unsalted water, cook 30 minutes, then remove 
skin and pack into glass jars. For beets, pour three tablespoons 
of vinegar in each jar, then fill with cold water. Place the rubber 
in position and the tops lightly on the jars, stand in boiler and 
cook for 1 hour. Then tighten the tops of the jars as quickly 
as possible. 

For carrots and turnips do not put vinegar in jar. Fill with 
cold water. 

Canned Peas, Lima Beans and Com 

Green peas and lima beans are shelled and washed. Corn is 
husked and freed from every particle of silk, and the pulp cut 
from the ears with a sharp knife. Sterilize jars, place the corn 
pulp, lima beans or peas in them, cool. Sterilized water must 
be poured in to fill the jars containing the peas and beans, but no 
water is necessary with the corn. Add % teaspoon of salt to 
pint of water. This will keep the vegetables green. Place the 
tops on lightly, then stand the jars in the boiler as in foregoing 
recipe. Pour tepid water around them. Cover and boil without 
stopping 2^ hours for peas or Hma beans, 3^^ hours for corn. 
Then finish as in above directions. 

87 



JELLY MAKING 

Before the principles of sterilizing were understood, fruit was 
preserved by cooking it with its weight of sugar. Only jellies 
are commonly done in this way, now. 

The juice of fruits that contain considerable pectin can be made 
into jelly. Pectin, although a carbohydrate, in some ways re- 
sembles gelatine. It dissolves in boiling water, and stiffens on 
cooling. It is most abundant in the harder parts of the fruit, the 
core and skin. 

Apples, quinces, crab apples, currants, and grapes make the 
best jellies. 

General Directions for Making Jelly 

Wash the fruit, and remove stems and imperfections. Cut 
large fruit into pieces. With watery fruits, such as grapes and 
currants, use no water. With apples and quinces use enough 
water to cover them. Cook the fruit until the juice flows, crush- 
ing it with a spoon. Remove it from the fire and strain it through 
a pointed bag hung from the ceiling or between two chairs. Do 
not squeeze the bag at first ; when nearly all has strained through, 
the bag may be squeezed. Keep this last juice by itself ; the jelly 
made from it will not be clear, but can be used for jelly cake, etc. 
Measure the juice, and measure out an equal quantity of sugar. 
Reheat the juice, add the sugar, and let boil. As scum forms 
remove it. When a little of the jelly dropped on a cold plate 
thickens slightly, pour into jelly glasses and set aside till firm. 

Quince Jelly 

Cut the quinces into quarters without paring or coring, cover 
with water, and cook until soft. Strain, and proceed according 
to "General Directions for Making Jelly." 

Jelly must be covered to protect it from mold. Paraffin is con- 
venient for this purpose. 

To Cover Jelly with Paraffin 

Melt the paraffin in a saucepan and pour it over the jelly to the 
depth of about one-eighth of an inch. If, on cooling, any bubbles 
form, exposing the surface of the jelly add another coat of paraf- 
fin. 

After filling fruit jars let them stand upside down over night. 
In the morning, screw the tops down as tightly as possible, wipe 
the jars carefully, label them and put them away in a cool, dark 
place. 

88 



Spiced Apple Jell 

1 quart apple juice 1 tbsp. each of clove, allspice 

1 quart sugar and cinnamon 

1 cup vinegar 

Cook it until it w^ill jell and then put in tumblers. When cold 
cover with a thin coating of paraffin. 

Spiced Grapes 

5 lbs. grapes 2 tsp. cinnamon and allspice 

3 lbs. sugar % tsp. cloves 
1 cup vinegar 

Pulp the grapes, boil skins until tender ; cook pulp and strain 
through a sieve, and add it to the skins ; put in the sugar, spices 
and vinegar. Boil until it becomes thick like marmalade and turn 
into glasses. 

Nut Marmalade 

6 lbs. sugar 2 lemons 

4 lbs. rhubarb 1 lb. English walnut meats 
4 oranges 

Remove the bitter rind of the oranges and lemons, slice them 
thin, cover with water and let stand all night. Boil till soft in the 
same water. Cut the rhubarb, add the sugar, lemons, oranges 
and lastly the nuts cut fine. Boil till thick and clear. Make early 
in the season when the rhubarb is tender. 

Orange Marmalade 

6 large navel oranges 3 large lemons 

Slice these about % inch thick. Measure and to every pint of 
fruit add 3 pints of water. Put in a jar and let it stand 24 hours. 
Then boil until tender and let stand 24 hours. Measure and add 
the sugar pint for pint. Let it come to a boil and boil furiously 
25 minutes. This will make 15 or 20 glasses. A grape fruit may 
be added. 

Conserves 

Pineapple Conserve is especially delicate. Peel and grate 
coarsely or run through the food chopper, three ripe pineapples, 
and add to them the grated rind and pulp of two lemons and three 
oranges, rejecting the seeds. Cook together for half an hour, 
then add an equal quantity of sugar and boil gently till thick as 
marmalade. 

Mixed Print Conserve. Pare twenty-four ripe peaches, ten 
pears and fifteen blue plums, cut the fruit in quarters and add 

89 



two pounds of white grapes, halved and freed from the seeds. 
Cook all together with an equal quantity of sugar until the syrup 
is thick and heavy, then place in sterilized jars and when cool 
seal. 

Carrot Conserve. The children will enjoy this on their bread 
or cakes. It is easily made and inexpensive. Select young car- 
rots, scrape and wash them, then slice thin. Cover with cold 
water and cook till soft enough to press through a sieve. Meas- 
ure the pulp and add the strained juice of two lemons, and the 
grated rind of one lemon and one orange, also three-fourths the 
quantity of light brown sugar. Cook till thick, and pour into 
tumblers. 

Ginger Pear. One peck hard pears, peel and cut in %, remove 
core, slice 4 lemons thin, add % pound preserved ginger cut in 
small pieces, 5 pounds granulated sugar, layer of pears, lemon 
and ginger, sprinkle thickly with sugar, add more fruit, have 
sugar at to.p ; let it stand over night, set over slow fire, bring to 
boiling point very slowly, let it simmer until the pears are done; 
will be dark red in color ; seal very hot. 

Currant Jelly. Free the currants from the leaves and stems ; 
wash them in a sieve. Put a small quantity into an agate pre- 
serving kettle and crush them gently. This makes a little juice 
in the kettle to start with so when placed over the heat the fruit 
will not stick. Let the currants simply heat slowly and not cook. 
When they are hot, crush them. Put a sieve over a large bowl 
and over this spread a double square of cheese-cloth. Turn the 
fruit and juice into the cheese-cloth and let it drain as long as it 
will drip ; never use any pressure, for that would make the jelly 
"cloudy." Measure the juices. To every pint of juice may be 
added one pint of granulated sugar. Let the juice boil 15 minutes 
before adding the sugar, which should be heated first. Then, as 
soon as the sugar is dissolved, pour a spoonful into a dish and 
place on the ice, and if it "jellies" it is ready to put into glasses. 

Oriental Jelly is novel and very delicious. It is made by cook- 
ing rose geranium leaves and two lemon verbena leaves in 2 
quarts of apple juice for a few moments, then proceed as in other 
jellies.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN FOODS AND FOOD MATERIALS 

From Bulletin No. 28, issued by United States Department of Agriculture 

The food value of any food or food material is estimated by finding out how 
much energy it yields in the form of heat when burned. Heat is measured by 
calories. One calorie is the amount of heat required to raise one pound of 
water four degrees Fahrenheit. The figures in the right-hand column thus 
show what the food value of a pound of each food or food material would be if 
every bit of it were perfectly digested and assimilated.
