sized onion, sliced. Cook until a light brown, and then add

V/2 lb. salmon, cooked 3 t. salt 

1 pt. cream >4 t. pepper 

1 c. stale bread Nutmeg or mace 
y^ c. butter 4 eggs 

3/2 c. mushrooms 

For a quart mould or a dozen small moulds use one and 
one-half pounds of salmon. Cook salmon and let cool. Free 
from bones and skin. Canned salmon may also be used. Put 
bread and cream together and cook until smooth. Chop, pound 
and sift the salmon and add the seasoning. Mix all ingredi- 
ents, except the eggs, and let cool. Then add the beaten 
eggs. Pour the mixture into small moulds or cups and set 
them into a pan containing hot water and bake thirty minutes. 
Turn them out on a hot platter, put a sprig of parsley in the 
center of each and pour about them cream or Bechamel sauce. 

Shrimps in Tomato Cases. 

1^ c. shrimp 1 c. soft bread crumbs 

6 medium sized tomatoes J4 c- cream 

2 T. butter Salt 

2 slices onion Paprika 

Break shrimp into small pieces. Prepare tomatoes, by 
cutting in halves, removing the pulp, and inverting on a sieve 
to drain. Melt butter in a sauce pan, add onion slices and 
brov^n them slightly, then remove and add tomato pulp. Cook 
this until reduced to one-half, and add the bread crumbs. 
When thoroughly mixed remove from fire and add cream, 
the shrimps and a good seasoning of salt and paprika. Fill 
the tomatoes, cover with buttered crumbs and bake quickly 
until browned. Serve either on lettuce or rounds of bread 
sauted in butter. 

Baked Fish with Tomato Sauce. 
Place the fish in the dripping pan with salt, pepper, small 
lumps of butter, and three tablespoons of tomato catsup (or 
strained canned tomatoes) poured over the top. Just before 
baking, add a little boiling water, baste frequently while bak- 
ing. A four pound fish must bake one hour. When tender 
and nicely browned, remove carefully to a warm platter and 
make the following sauce : 



14 THE EAST MILWAUKEE COOK BOOK. 

Tomato Sauce. 

Add to the boiling water in the dripping pan enough 
water to make the required quantity of sauce. With a four 
pound fish you will have almost enough to fill an ordinary 
sized gravy boat. Thicken with flour stirred smooth with 
water to thin gravy, and add two tablespoons of strained 
canned tomatoes, two tablespoons tomato catsup, one of 
Worcestershire sauce, the juice of half a lemon, and salt and 
pepper to taste. The canned tomatoes may be omitted by 
adding more catsup. Cook several minutes, stirring constant- 
ly and serve very hot.

and season lightly with pepper and salt. Mix the milk, flour, 
finely chopped onions, thyme, parsley, nutmeg, salt and white 
pepper and put over a quick fire until it becomes a thick 
paste. Take from fire and stir in butter and yolks of eggs 
and mix well together. Pass through a sieve. Put some of 
the strained sauce into a baking dish, then a layer of fish 
and another of sauce, and so on. until fish and sauce are used

Baked Ham with Sherry Wine. 

Spread a slice of raw, smoked ham one-half inch thick,

brown sugar. Put into baking dish, add Sherry wine one- 
half inch deep. Bake about one hour and baste from time 
to time with a little water. 

Baked Hash. 

Cut up small, any kind of cold, fresh meat. Add to it, 
about one-third the quantity of bread crumbs, with a lump 
of butter, cut up, a little chopped onion, pepper and salt. Mix 
well and put in a baking dish. Cover with milk and let it 
soak until the bread is perfectly soft. Stir well together and 
bake. If you have gravy on hand, it will answer as well as 
butter, in preparing this appetizing breakfast dish. 

Beef Tongue a La Jardiniere. 

Boil a fresh beef's tongue one hour. Skin and lay in 
your roaster, upon a layer of vegetables, cut in dices — carrots, 
turnips, celery, potatoes, peas, beans, and if you can get them, 
button onions and small round tomatoes. Pour over the above 
some of the Avater in which the tongue was boiled; cover and 
cook slowly two hours, if tongue is large. Remove the tongue, 
keeping it closely covered and hot, while you take out the 
vegetables with a skimmer. Thicken the gravy with brown 
flour. Place tongue on dish, arrange the vegetables about 
it, and pour some of the gravy over all, serving the rest in a 
sauce-boat. 

Casserole Roast.

1 slice salt pork 1 c. celery 

1 c. carrots A few pepper corns 

1 c. turnips 2 c. water or stock

Caviar Bouchees. 

While there is no caviar that is not salted, the best 
varieties contain much less than the cheaper. Best of all 
varieties is the Malossel, which means in Russian, little salt. 
As it is so delicate, it is put up in tin boxes and kept in cold 
storage. In Russia, it is served w^ith chopped onions or pars- 
ley and a bit of lemon as an appetizer. Here there are varia- 
tions in its service, one of the nicest ways being the follow- 
ing: Spread fried circles or fingers of bread with a thin layer 
of caviar. In the center place a large olive with the stone 
removed and the cavity filled with minced red peppers. Hold 
olive in place with a few drops of mayonnaise dressing and 
put tiny dots of same about border. 

Chicken a La Mode de Bresse. 

2 small chickens, cut in pieces 1 c. bouillon 

2 T. butter 1 pt. thick cream 

1 onion 2 egg yolks 

Salt 1 small can mushrooms 

Pepper Parsley 

Put the chickens and butter into a saucepan and cook 
until browned. Add the bouillon, onion and parsley, and 
season well. Let cook for one hour. A quarter of an hour 
before serving, take out the parsley and onion and add the 
mushrooms. After the mushrooms have cooked for ten min- 
utes, put in the cream and allow it to heat without boiling. 
Thicken with the yolks of eggs beaten up, stirring them in 
slowly. Serve on toast. If desired, add a little lemon juice 
or slice of a lemon. This is enough for eight persons. 

Creamed Chicken. 

3 43^-lb. chickens 1 can mushrooms 

2 sweet breads 3 qt. cream or milk 
12 T. butter 15 T. flour 

Boil chickens and sweet bread. When cold, cut up as for 
salad. Melt butter and flour together and pour hot cream 
over this. Stir until it thickens. Flavor with a little grated 
onion and a very little nutmeg. Season highly with black 
and red pepper and salt. Put a layer of prepared chicken in 
a baking dish, then a layer of dressing and so on, until the 
dish is filled. Then cover with bread crumbs and a few pieces 
of butter. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes. This will serve 
twenty-five people.

Chili Con Carne. 

I'lb. chopped beef . 1 can tomatoes 

2 good sized onions 1 can kidney beans 

Pepper Celery 

1 t. Chili powder Salt

1 lb. beef, mostly lean 1 pt. red kidney beans 

1 c. sifted pulp of sweet red 1 clove

Cut the beef into one-half inch cubes and broil until brown 
on all sides. Add the pulp of sweet peppers, which have been 
boiled until soft, in water enough to float them. Remove skin 
and seeds before sifting. Add the clove, the beans and the 
garlic, crushed with a fork. The best results are obtained 
by using dried beans, which have been soaked in cold water 
for a day or more and allowed to simmer in clear water until 
tender. The canned beans may be used if more convenient. 
Cover closely and simmer until meat begins to fall apart. 
Serve with corn bread, baked crisp in very thin sheets. 

Chicken Saute a La Bordelaise. 

2 small chickens 3 onions 

16 small potatoes 54 ^b. butter 

6 medium-sized artichokes 1 pt. bouillon 
6 carrots 1 small piece garlic 

Pepper Parsley Salt 

Cut chickens into pieces and brown in two-thirds of the 
butter. Rub the sides of the pot, or casserole, with the garlic. 
Pare the potatoes and cook them slowly in the rest of the 
butter. Prepare the artichokes by letting them cook twenty 
minutes in boiling water with a little salt. Drain off the 
water add a large piece of butter and let them simmer until 
served. Boil carrots until soft. Cut the onions into slices, 
soak in a little milk, roll in flour and fry so that each piece 
will be separate. Wash the parsley and dry, then dip into 
boiling lard until crisp. Place the pieces of chicken on a 
platter garnished with the vegetables and serve gravy sepa- 
rately. 



THE EAST MILWAUKEE COOK BOOK. 19 



Chicken Pie. 

Cook the chicken until quite tender. Add plenty of butter, 
salt and pepper. Make a good, rich crust of baking powder 
biscuit dough, and line the sides of a pudding dish with this 
crust. Place the chicken into this with at least one quart 
of liquid in which it was boiled. Cover with crust 
and bake. When done, cut a round hole in the 
center of crust and remove the piece. Pour in balance of 
gravy, which is thickened with a little flour dissolved in a little 
cold water, and return crust. It is then ready for the table.

Automatic Cooking with Gas 

Crowded into the busy life of the modern woman are so many 
demands upon her time that she is becoming greatly interested 
in so-called automatic cooking. Automatic cooking makes it 
possible to place the various dishes composing the dinner into 
the oven all at the same time, light the gas, set the time clock, 
and several hours later, everything is ready to serve. The cook- 
ing has been going on while the housewife has been absent at 
the club or shopping or attending to her other household duties. 

THE AUTOMATIC GAS RANGE 
WORKS WHILE YOU PLAY 

The automatic gas range has an insulated oven. No heat es- 
capes into the room, your kitchen remains cool and comfort- 
able. Cooking odors are all retained in the oven. It is eco- 
nomical to operate because it cooks with stored up heat. 

START YOUR SIX O'CLOCK DINNER 
AT 2 P. M. IF YOU WISH. 

Put everything into the oven at once, set the clock, light 
the gas and then forget it until time to serve. That is 
the big advantage of the automatic oven. 

Can Be Used As An Ordinary Oven Too. 

Certain foods are better baked in the direct heat of the ordi- 
nary gas oven. Your automatic oven can also be used as a 
direct oven — no trouble to change. Its broiler and top burners 
are the same as an ordinary gas range, which for speed, eco- 
nomy and convenience never have been surpassed. 

Automatic cooking can be done better and cheaper with gas. 

Besides tl^e advantage of being able to use your automatic 
gas oven in the ordinary way, there is the GREAT ECO- 
NOMY of gas for cooking. 

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN AUTOMATIC 
COOKING SEE THE AUTOMATIC GAS RANGE.

Take TheWork Out of Wash Day 

Why should you keep on wasting strength and 
time on washday — using the tub and washboard? That 
is the most tiresome, most expensive way to get your 
washing done. It wears out clothes, it costs too much 
for help (if you hire a laundress) and it makes a whole 
day of drudgery. 

Why should you wash clothes in the old fashioned 
way ? Get an 

APPV ELECTRIC WASHING and 
-^■^^-^ WRINGING MACHINE 

and enjoy leisure time on washday. Push a button 
and the washing will be done. An hour is long 
enough for the average washing, and 2 cents pays 
the electricity. 

No rubbing— everything made wonderfully clean.

is used in Dr. Price's Cream Baking 
Powder because it is the best and most 
healthful ingredient known for the pur- 
pose. 

Alum and phosphate, which are derived 
from mineral acids, are used in some 
baking powders, instead of cream of 
tartar, because they are cheaper. 

If you have been induced to use baking 
powders made from alum or phosphate, 
use Dr. Price's Cream Baking Powder 
instead. You will be pleased with the 
results and the difference in the quality 
of the food

CAKES. 

She measured out the butter with a very solemn air; 

The milk and sugar also ; she took the greatest care 

To count the eggs correctly and to add a little bit 

Of baking powder, which, you know, beginners oft omit 

Then she stirred it all together, and she baked it full an hour; 

But she never quite forgave herself for leaving out the flour. 

Cake Flour. 

5 lb. bread flour 1 lb. cornstarch 

Cake flour produces much better results in cake making 
than common flour. This is especially true of angel food 
cakes. Cake flour can easily and successfully be made at 
home and, if kept handy in a special place, you will not be 
tempted to use bread flour. Take five pounds of bread flour 
to one pound box of cornstarch and sift it together three times. 
You can make it in small quantities, if you wish, provided you 
are careful to keep the proportion of one to five.

Metal Garages 

MADE ENTIRELY OF STEEL 

The accompanying illustration shows one of the many styles of metal 
garages manufactured by us. 

The economy and convenience derived from having your own garage 
right near your home are many. 

In the first place "PORTO" Garages made entirely of steel afford 
absolute protection from fire and vandalism. They are very orna- 
mental and can be painted any color to be in perfect keeping with 
other buildings and surroundings. 

Another important advantage is the fact that they are portable. Should 
the car owner decide to move he can take the garage with him. 
"PORTO" Metal Garages are made in sizes to fit all makes of cars 
— with plenty of room for the car and a liberal amount of space to 
work around it.

JELLY AND PRESERVES. 

How to Preserve a Husband. 

Be careful in your selection, do not choose too young- and 
take only such as have been reared in a good, moral atmo- 
sphere. When once decided upon and selected, let that part 
remain forever settled, and give your entire thought to prep- 
aration for domestic use. Some insist on keeping them in a 
pickle, while others are constantly getting into hot water. 
Even poor varieties may be made sweet, tender, and good by 
garnishing them with patience, well sweetened by smiles, and 
flavored with kisses to taste, then wrap well in a mantle 
of charity, keep warm with a steady fire of domestic devotion, 
and serve with peaches and cream. When thus preserved, 
they will keep for years. 

Crabapple Jelly. 

Wash crabapples and cut in halves. Put in a kettle with 
just enough water to cover them. Cook thoroughly and put 
in a jelly bag and let drip. For every cup of juice add a 
cup of sugar and let boil about twenty minutes. Two or three 
rose geranium leaves may be added. Pour into glasses and 
when cold, cover the top with melted paraffin. 

Cranberry Jelly. 

4 c. cranberries 2 c. sugar 

1 c. boiled water 

Pick over and wash. Cook slowly in boiling water twenty 
minutes or until soft. Rub through sieve, add sugar and stir. 
Cook about five minutes or until it thickens. Pour into wet 
moulds. Serve with meat. 

Cranberry Jelly. 

1 qt. cranberries 2 c. sugar 

1 pt. water 

Simmer cranberries and water until they burst. Add 
sugar and boil fifteen minutes. Force through sieve into a 
mould.

Currant Jelly. 

Wash the currants and put them into a kettle over a very 
slow fire with a small quantity of water. Cool and strain 
through a thin bag. For every pint of juice add one pound 
sugar. Let boil twenty minutes. When cool pour paraffin 
over top. 

Pineapple Preserves. 

Pare and grate the fruit, and make a syrup of one-half 
pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Cook together about 
ten minutes, fill into jars and seal tight. Delicious to serve 
with ice cream, charlotte russe or blanc mange. 

Plum Conserve. 

1 sq. basket blue plums 1 lb. seedless raisins 

4 oranges About 5 lb. sugar 
Grated rind of 2 oranges 3^ lb. broken walnuts 

Boil plums, oranges, raisins and the grated rind of the 
oranges with an equal amount of sugar (about five pounds). 
Let fruit boil to pieces before adding sugar. Watch closely, 
stirring it, as it burns easily. Just before putting into glasses 
add the broken walnuts. 

Red Raspberries. ~ 

Mash the berries and add one pound of granulated sugar 
for every pound of fruit. Mix thoroughly and let stand twelve 
hours, stirring occasionally. Seal in glass cans without heat- 
ing. They will keep for a year or more and retain their flavor 
much better than when cooked. If they should appear to be 
fermenting, do not be alarmed. 

Spiced Gooseberries.

4 lb. sugar Cloves

Choose very ripe tomatoes, wash and cut them in pieces. 
Now put them into an enameled kettle, or jar, and let them 
stand three days in a warm place, stirring them twice each 
day. Strain by running them through a coarse sieve, fine 
enough to hold the seeds. Boil the juice without cover (being 
careful not to burn it). When it is the consistency of thick 
cream, measure it carefully and to each gallon of pulp, add 
one-half pound granulated sugar (not beet sugar), one-half 
pint cider vinegar, one teaspoon ground mace and one-fourth 
teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Boil fifteen minutes, bottle and 
cork. When cold, paraffin may be poured into the bottles in 
place of corks. This is a very choice recipe and the sauce 
will keep for years (and is exactly the beautiful tomato color).
