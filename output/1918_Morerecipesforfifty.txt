PREFACE 

FROM the very day of America's awakening to the need 
of conservation, the members of the School of Domestic 
Science have entered heartily and enthusiastically into 
each succeeding plan of the Administration for conserv- 
ing the foods needed by our Allies. In order to do not only 
"our bit," but our utmost, radical changes have been made 
in the School menus, and much time has been given by 
teachers and by students of the Class of 1918 to experi- 
mental cookery with the various substitutes. In preparing 
the recipes, two definite objects have been kept in mind: 
the one to simplify for institutions the problem of provid- 
ing satisfactory meals with less sugar, less fat, and less 
wheat; the other to enable them to do so at minimum 
expense. 

The results of these months of work are embodied in 
" More Recipes for Fifty," and it is hoped that the book 
will be valuable in the years to come, as well as during 
these fateful years of the great World War.

INTRODUCTION 

A recipe, called to judgment, must answer three 
questions : 

Is it practical ? 

Is it economical ? 

Is the result attractive ? 

These questions have to be answered in the affirmative 
when the recipes are planned for small groups. The 
answers must be still more emphatic when cooking is 
done for half a hundred. 

The first book by Miss Smith has proved its rare value 
to the many dietitians and institution managers who have 
used it. The second carries the added merit of adjustment 
to our increased list of staples. 

Before the war, we were in a rut in our kitchens. We 
used wheat, meat, sugar, and fats thoughtlessly and 
monotonously. Now, happily, cooking is lifted out of this 
dull routine. It has become a real adventure. 

On any new trail, however, we need a guide who has 
thoroughly explored the danger points and can guard us 
against them. 

Repeated experiments with what, in the first days of 
the world struggle, we called "substitutes" have produced 
the recipes in this book. They make a reliable and com- 
plete collection of palatable dishes which are not only 
good in theory, but entirely satisfactory in practice.

FRUITS 

Dried Fruits 

If properly cooked, dried fruits are a delicious and 
convenient form of fruit for winter use. Comparatively 
few people, however, cook dried fruits properly, and the 
result is a strong prejudice against them. At a time when 
the preservation of all food is so essential, and containers 
are so increasingly scarce, dried fruit comes to its own. 

It should be used freely: for breakfast fruit, for 
luncheon and supper desserts, for ices and sherbets, and 
for other dinner desserts. Often a combination of two 
fruits makes a pleasant variety; as dried apples and 
raisins, or prunes and apricots. 

Wash fruit thoroughly in cold water ; drain. Add cold 
water to cover, and let soak from one to three days in a 
cold place ; the drier and harder the fruit, the longer the 
time required for soaking. Bring slowly to the boiling 
point, and without stirring cook in double boiler or in 
fireless cooker two or more hours, or until fruit is per- 
fectly tender, but unbroken. Sprinkle sugar or syrup over 
top of fruit, and cook twenty or thirty minutes longer; 
do not stir. A little salt added to the water before cooking 
is often an improvement; add lemon, spices, or other 
seasoning at same time if used. Corn syrup may be used 
in place of part or all of the sugar. Sweet, well-ripened 
fruits require little or no sugar. If the juice is watery 
and flavorless after cooking the fruit, turn it into a sepa- 
rate saucepan, and boil down to desired consistency.

Cranberry Bananas 

50 bananas 3 cups cranberry juice 

cup margarine I cup or more corn syrup 

Left-over cranberry juice may be used, in which case 
no syrup will be needed. If bananas are to be used with 
meat, less sweetening will be required than when served 
as dessert. The margarine may be omitted. Peel bananas, 
place in shallow agate pans ; dot over with bits of mar- 
garine, add half the syrup. Bake thirty minutes or until 
done, basting occasionally with remaining syrup. 

Sliced Bananas with Fruit Juice 

Allow one medium-sized banana to each person. Slice 
into sauce dishes ; dip over fruit two or three tablespoons 
cranberry juice which has been sweetened with corn syrup. 
Cherry, red raspberry, or red currant juice may be used. 
Or serve half a banana to each person, and with it red 
currants, cut oranges, or strawberries, which have stood 
in sugar an hour or so ; or stewed cranberries or peaches. 

Bananas with Orange Sauce 

50 bananas f cup cornstarch 

3 cups white corn syrup -J cup margarine 

1 1 quarts boiling water 2 cups orange juice 

Bake bananas in hot oven for twenty or thirty minutes, 
or until they swell almost to bursting ; remove from skin. 
Or peel and put in casseroles to bake. Serve with hot or 
cold sauce: Mix cornstarch with a little cold water, and 
add to remainder when it boils. Boil five minutes; add

margarine, syrup, one teaspoon salt, and, boil, One- minute'. 
Add juice and grated rind of orange. Pour over bananas 
before serving. 

Bananas with Lemon Sauce 

3 cups corn syrup \ cup cornstarch 

ij teaspoons salt I J quarts boiling water 

f cup lemon juice 4 dozen bananas 

Mix salt and cornstarch with a cup cold water. Bring 
remaining water to boil, add to cornstarch, stirring con- 
stantly; add corn syrup and boil five minutes, then add 
lemon juice and grated rind. Peel bananas ; cut in halves 
lengthwise, then each half crosswise. Put in baking dishes, 
add sauce, and bake thirty minutes in moderate oven. 

Bananas with Sultana Sauce 

25 to 50 bananas 9 tablespoons cornstarch 

i quart Sultana raisins I tablespoon salt 

1 1 quarts water f cup lemon juice or strong 
f quart corn syrup vinegar 

Peel bananas, removing all coarse threads; place side 
by side in baking dishes. Wash raisins, add water, and 
simmer half an hour or longer, replenishing water as it 
evaporates ; there should be one and one-half quarts when 
done. Mix cornstarch, salt, and a little cold water which 
has been saved out. Add boding raisin water and syrup, 
boil two minutes; add vinegar or lemon juice, bring to 
boil, and pour over bananas. Bake in hot oven thirty 
minutes, or until bananas are done. Serve as dessert. The 
bananas may be baked separately, and sauce poured over 
them when served. In that case, boil sauce five minutes.

/Ene-'ritimbtfi;' of bananas depends upon size; there should 
be the equivalent of a small banana to each person. 

Stuffed Prunes 

2 pounds prunes i cup chopped walnuts 

3 cups chopped raisins -| cup dark corn syrup 

Soak prunes over night, or longer if very hard. Drain, 
steam thirty minutes, and remove stones. Mix raisins, 
nuts, and syrup ; cook five or ten minutes in double boiler ; 
fill prunes with mixture, and chill. 

Apricot and Apple Jam 

Soak two pounds dried apricots for one or two days 
in cold water to barely cover. Add four pounds peeled, 
cored, and sliced apple. Cover closely, and cook in oven 
until soft. Add about three-fourths its bulk of dark corn 
syrup and sugar mixed, and half a teaspoon salt. Cook 
until thick and uniform in color, adding more syrup or 
brown sugar if not sweet enough. One seeded and chopped 
lemon may be added if desired. 

Prunes and Apricots 

2 pounds dried apricots 3 \ cups corn syrup or 

i \ pounds pitted prunes sugar 

Wash fruit separately and thoroughly ; add cold water 
to cover ; soak from one to two days. Put in double boiler 
or fireless kettle in alternate layers, add water in which 
they were soaked, and cook several hours, or until quite 
soft but unbroken. Add syrup without stirring; cook 
fifteen minutes longer in fireless or on back of range. 
Unpitted prunes may be used, requiring about two pounds. 



FRUITS 5 

Apples, Italian Style 

Choose large, juicy, well-flavored apples, attractive in 
appearance. Wash and polish well, and serve in fruit dish. 
Pass with them Neufchatel, cottage, Roquefort, Young 
America, or any cheese that is not hard and dry. Cut 
apples in slices, and spread with cheese. Serve for luncheon 
dessert. 

Apples Baked with Syrup 

50 large, tart apples i J quarts thick maple or 

1 J quarts water brown sugar syrup 

Wash and core apples, and if skins are tough, pare the 
upper half. If possible, bake apples in baking pans that 
can be covered. Add one teaspoon salt and boiling water 
to syrup, pour over apples, and bake in rather hot oven 
an hour or more. They should be perfectly soft, even if 
they cook to pieces. If some apples are done first, remove 
from pan, and continue cooking the others. If juice seems 
watery, boil a few minutes after removing apples. Pour 
juice over apples, and chill. Serve for dessert. If apples 
are used for breakfast, one quart syrup is sufficient. 

Baked Apples De Luxe 

1 8 pounds tart apples I teaspoon salt 

2 quarts brown sugar i bunch mint leaves 

1 1 quarts water Peel of one or two lemons 

Do not use apples that cook to pieces easily. Corn syrup 
may be used in place of sugar by leaving out one pint of 
water. Cut yellow peel of lemons in small pieces. Wash 
mint, and allow about two leaves to each apple. Pare, core, 
and halve apples. Put into large kettle or bean pots. Bring 
sugar and water to boil ; add mint, lemon, and salt. Pour

Pare apples and slice thin ; put into baking dishes. Mix 
syrup, salt, and water; bring to boil, pour over apples, 
and dot with bits of margarine. Cover, and bake in 
moderate oven until apples are tender and amber colored. 
They should be only slightly colored and unbroken. Leave 
in dishes until cold. Serve for dessert with soft custard 
sauce, with cream, or plain.

4 quarts cranberries 3 lemons 

I-J quarts corn syrup 2 quarts celery cut in 

J teaspoon salt half-inch pieces 

Wash and pick over berries ; drain well. Put berries, 
syrup, salt, and lemon juice in kettle ; heat slowly, then boil 
until juice jellies. Cool partly, stir in dry celery, and put 
in cold place to mold. If it does not harden, serve in sauce 
dishes. 

Summer Fruit Cups 

Fruit cups may be served as an appetizer or as dessert. 
For the former, two tablespoons of the mixed fruit and 
juice is sufficient for each person ; but for the latter, more 
generous servings should be allowed. Under existing 
conditions, it will be found possible many times to prepare 
fruit cups with less sugar or syrup than heretofore, 
sometimes even without any. Sugar should be made into 
a syrup, using half as much water as sugar, and boiling it 
two or three minutes before adding to fruit. White corn 
syrup or honey may be used in place of sugar syrup. Cook 
currants, sour cherries, or other very acid fruit, in syrup 
four or five minutes, but simply pour hot syrup over 
raspberries, peaches, and other mild fruits. Let stand in 
syrup until ice cold. There are many delicious combina- 
tions available in native fruits from June to October: 
large strawberries cut in halves, sprinkled with powdered 
sugar, and chilled ; raspberries and currants ; diced water- 
melon and canned or fresh pineapple, with or without 



8 MORE RECIPES FOR FIFTY 

lemon juice; blackberries flavored with lemon juice and 
nutmeg to taste; stoned cherries, with diced banana or 
pear or pineapple; cut peaches, stoned cherries, and a 
sprinkling of minced angelica. Sometimes a combination 
of three or four left-over fruits may be used. 

Winter Fruit Cups 

Winter fruit cups do not require syrup. Serve without 
sugar, or with powdered or granulated sugar sprinkled 
over prepared fruit before it is chilled. In order to save 
sugar, however, white corn syrup may be used instead. If 
sugar is used, do not allow more than two tablespoons 
to a large grapefruit. Peel grapefruit, separate sections 
from membrane, and cut in thirds; peel and separate 
oranges into sections, removing membrane ; peel bananas 
and cut in small dice. Winter fruits may be combined 
in various ways: grapefruit, Malaga grapes seeded and 
halved, and Maraschino cherries shredded or halved; 
grapefruit, canned pears, and preserved ginger chopped 
finely; oranges, lemon juice, and minced fresh mint; 
oranges, grapefruit, and bananas; oranges and apples; 
stewed figs cut in small pieces, lemon juice, peaches, and 
marshmallows. 



SUBSTITUTES 

THE problem of substitutes in cookery reduces itself 
to three factors : fat, sugar, and flour. 

FAT 

The first one is easily disposed of: use butter substi- 
tutes, oils, hardened oil, and clarified drippings in place 
of butter and lard in cooking. In substituting fats, it 
should be remembered that seven-eighths of a cup of oil 
or lard is the equivalent of one cup of butter; fourteen 
and one-half tablespoons of hardened oil is equivalent to 
sixteen tablespoons of butter. Also it is well to bear in 
mind that many of our cakes and prepared dishes have 
been richer in fat than at all necessary, so that it is often 
possible to cut down more or less the amount called for 
in pre-war recipes. 

SUGAR 

There are two ways of saving sugar : by making things 
less sweet, and by using molasses, syrups, or honey in 
place of all or a part of the required sugar. In nearly all 
of the dessert and cake recipes that we have been in the 
habit of using, the amount of sweetening may be reduced 
with satisfactory results. In substituting molasses and 
syrups for sugar, leave out as much liquid as there is 
molasses or syrup added. In using honey, deduct one- 
fifth cup of liquid for each cup of honey substituted. 
Dark cakes may be made without any sugar, or with a 
small amount of brown sugar in addition to the molasses

or syrup used. Add one teaspoon of soda for each cup of 
molasses substituted for sugar. 

FLOUR 

At first, the substitution of unfamiliar flours for wheat 
flour presents serious difficulties, but the acquisition of 
a few fundamental principles and a little practical ex- 
perience soon enables one to use substitute flours very 
satisfactorily. 

Corn flour is a new acquaintance to most of us, but 
corn meal is an old friend, although one whose possibilities 
we have never realized. In some sections we have been 
confined to white meal, in others to yellow meal. Now 
we have increasingly available both white and yellow 
flour, as well as white and yellow meal. In substituting 
corn products for wheat flour, use from three-fourths to 
seven-eighths as much. Corn flour and corn meal give the 
best results when combined with one-third or one-half 
wheat flour, as they contain so little gluten; but very 
satisfactory quick breads and sponge cake may be made 
wholly of corn. 

Barley flour, in particular, has been the bane of the 
housewife. The first barley flour put on the market was 
all barley, but now, under government regulation, three 
or four per cent wheat is added ; and the result is a flour 
which can be used alone or in large part in almost every- 
thing but yeast bread. The product is, of course, much 
darker, and has the characteristic barley taste unless 
counteracted by other flavors, but in time we shall become 
accustomed to that and think nothing of it. 

For yeast bread, from twenty-five to fifty per cent 
wheat flour is needed in order to give a satisfactory loaf. 
In many cases, a mixture of two or more substitutes gives 



SUBSTITUTES 1 1 

better results than one alone. Brown gravies and sauces, 
muffins, biscuits, noodles, dark cakes, sponge cakes, and 
many puddings may be made wholly of barley flour. 

A good deal is being said about the acid in barley, and 
the necessity for using limewater or some other agent to 
counteract it. When it is remembered that entire wheat 
flour and corn products contain almost as much acid as 
barley, the necessity for neutralizing it in the one case, 
when it is not done in the other, seems still an open 
question. Yeast bread made with barley flour may have 
a slightly acid, but not unpleasant, flavor which increases 
as the bread grows older; but baking powder and soda 
mixtures have no noticeable acid taste. 

With such substitutes as cornstarch, potato flour, and 
rice flour, it is necessary in many cases to use from 
twenty-five to fifty per cent wheat, barley, or rye flour, 
to furnish gluten enough to make them stand up. Sponge 
and angel cakes may be made wholly of starch flours; 
"butter" cakes, muffins, and similar doughs requiring a 
large number of eggs, may be made with at least half of 
such flours. 

In making over old recipes, or for reversing the process 
when the war is over, the following table gives approxi- 
mately the amount of substitute flour to use in place of 
pastry flour, as that is the kind of wheat flour generally 
used in baking powder mixtures. In substituting for 
bread flour, use two tablespoons more to a cup than when 
substituting for pastry flour. For instance, use one cup 
instead of seven-eighths cup of barley.

For the present, at least, it is more patriotic to use 
largely the so-called "quick breads" in place of yeast 
bread. Since they do not keep as well, it is necessary to 
bake less and of tener. Steamed breads have an advantage 
over baked ones in the longer cooking, which makes them 
more digestible. Left-over muffins, corn bread, and other 
quick breads may be toasted. 

Wheat, barley, rye, and corn flour should be sifted 
before measuring ; granulated corn meal and the starches, 
such as cornstarch and potato flour, may be used without. 

The number of eggs used may be increased or decreased 
to suit prevailing conditions. If fewer eggs are used, add 
one teaspoon baking powder and two tablespoons liquid 
for each one omitted. If the number is increased, reverse 
the process, omitting the same amount of baking powder 
and liquid. 

Milk for cooking is always skim milk, unless otherwise 
specified. Water may be substituted for milk if necessary ; 
and sour milk for buttermilk, or the reverse.

tender; remove from liquor, and let get cold. Remove 
meat carefully from bones, and cut in two-inch pieces; 
they need not be regular in shape, but should be neatly cut. 
Put bones back in stock and simmer one or two hours; 
strain, and remove fat. Cream together fat and flour, 
add hot broth and seasoning, stirring all the time; boil 
five minutes. Add meat without stirring. Cut celery in

Maryland Chicken 

Dress, singe, and clean roasting chickens ; there should 
be about twenty-five pounds after they are dressed. Cut 
in pieces for serving. Roll in salted barley flour, saute in 
pork fat or cooking oil till golden brown ; remove to kettle. 
Add one and one-half cups barley or bread flour to fat in 
frying pan, stirring while it browns. Add to three quarts 
hot milk, stirring till smooth; cook fifteen minutes in 
double boiler, add one tablespoon salt and one teaspoon 
pepper. Turn sauce over chicken, and simmer from 
thirty to sixty minutes, according to age of chicken. Cook 
in oven, with two or three asbestos mats or grates under 
kettle to prevent burning. Garnish with chopped parsley, 
and serve with boiled rice. 

To Try Out Fat 

Cut suet, tallow, or trimmings of fresh fat pork in small 
pieces, or put through meat chopper. Soak mutton or 
chicken fat for twenty- four hours in cold salted water, 
changing water several times to remove the objectionable 
flavor; drain well before heating. Cook slowly in oven 
or double boiler for several hours. When fat is melted, 
strain through cheesecloth, pressing to obtain all the fat. 
Keep in cool place. 

The addition of one part cottonseed oil to three parts 
strained fat makes a good cooking fat. 

Save the scraps or crackling to use in suet puddings, 
gingerbread, or hash. 

To Deodorize and Clarify Fats 

Any liquor in which meat has been boiled should be 
allowed to stand until the fat has risen to the top and 



MEATS III 

solidified. Remove fat to saucepan, scraping off sediment 
or particles of meat that cling to the bottom, then clarify 
and deodorize by any of the following methods : 

Add about a teaspoon soda to each quart of fat, barely 
cover with cold water, and cook very slowly until the 
water has evaporated ; add soda and a sliced raw potato, 
omitting water, and cook slowly until all bubbling ceases ; 
put a piece of charcoal in pan with the fat, and heat until 
there is no bubbling; add half a cup mild vinegar to a 
quart or more fat, and cook slowly until it has evaporated. 
Strain and cool. A mixture of several kinds of fat may 
be treated, instead of taking them separately. 

Savory Fat 

4 pounds fat : sausage, i tablespoon salt 

mutton, ham, veal 4 sliced apples 

i cup chopped onion i tablespoon sage 

If fat is salty, omit part or all of salt. If preferred, a 
mixture of sage, thyme, and marjoram may be used. 
Cook ingredients together slowly until soft ; strain, and let 
harden. Use in cooking meats, vegetables, soups, hash, 
and gravies whenever a highly seasoned dish is wanted. 

Bacon should be kept separate, and used in dishes re- 
quiring bacon flavor. 



MEAT SAUCES

smooth and thickened. Do not return to fire, but cook in 
double boiler, thirty minutes or more, with water boiling 
underneath. Stir occasionally. Add seasonings. Use for 
highly seasoned sauces, such as curry ; for vegetables with 
distinctive flavor, like tomatoes; or for such meats as 
bacon, ham, or sausage.

eighths. Cook until well browned in small amount of oil 
or other fat. Drain, and add to two quarts White Sauce II. 
Be careful not to burn fat, and use any that is left in 
making the sauce. Peanuts may be used in place of 
almonds, but they should be cooked in fat only long enough 
to heat them well, unless they have not been roasted.

Spring Greens 

There are many common, so-called weeds that furnish 
appetizing greens for those who have no early greens in 
the garden. Every locality can furnish one or more 
of these edible weeds, in addition to the ever present 
dandelion. 

Pigweed, or lamb's quarters, makes good greens when 
young and tender, and is found wherever there is culti- 
vated land. It may be used alone or in combination with 
other greens, and is cooked like spinach. Dandelions 
should be gathered before the flower bud makes much 
growth, and may be cooked like other greens or served 
raw as a salad. The marsh marigold, or cowslip, found 
in marshy places, is prepared like spinach ; also purslane, 
or "pusley." Sorrel, a common wayside weed in many 
localities, may be used alone, or in combination as a salad ; 
or cooked with dandelion, which makes a pleasing com- 
bination. Mustard should be used when young, either 
alone or in combination with greens of a mild flavor, such 
as purslane or pigweed. Very young, crisp mustard leaves 
make a good salad green. Milkweed is one of the most 
valuable of the edible weeds, and, unlike many of them, 
may be used throughout the season. Early in the spring, 
the young stem may be used ; later, only the branches are

edible. The young stalks may be bunched and cooked like 
asparagus, with either melted butter or a white sauce. 
The branches are usually cooked like spinach. 

Kale 

Remove tough leaves, wash thoroughly, and drain. 
Cook in boiling water, adding one tablespoon salt to four

SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 

THERE are three types of salad in common use: the 
light or "green" salad of lettuce or other salad plants, 
cucumbers, tomatoes, or radishes; the substantial salad 
of meats, fish, or nutritious vegetables; and the fruit or 
cheese salad, suitable for dessert. 

In the recipes that follow, the fruit salads, and a few 
other kinds, are usually given without definite amounts. 
The size of fruits and the desired size of servings deter- 
mine the amount. For instance, half an egg or a whole 
egg may be allowed to each person. If pears or peaches 
are large, half of one makes a fair-sized serving; but if 
fruit is small, or servings are to be large, one and one-half 
or two must be allowed to each. If lettuce is to be served 
alone, at least nine large heads are needed; if used as 
foundation or garnish, six large heads are sufficient, unless 
servings are to be very generous in size. 

Wash salad plants thoroughly, and keep in cold place 
until served. Marinate vegetables and meats for an hour 
or more in freshly made or left-over French Dressing. 
Do not add dressing to green salads till just before serv- 
ing, as they wilt very quickly. 

If parsley (or lettuce) is washed and kept in tightly 
covered receptacle, it will keep fresh and crisp for some 
time. 

There are several oils, besides olive oil, that are suitable 
and satisfactory for marinating salads, and for dressings ; 
cottonseed, peanut, and corn oil are particularly good.

SANDWICHES 

THERE are two types of sandwiches in common use: 
the substantial sandwich, which makes the main dish for 
luncheon or supper; and the small, dainty sandwich, 
served at afternoon teas and receptions. 

Breads of all kinds may be used for sandwiches : white 
and dark yeast breads, and quick breads made with baking 
powder or soda. The latter do not slice as well, but other- 
wise make very satisfactory sandwiches. To use with 
meat or fish, a bread made without molasses or a notice- 
able amount of sugar should be chosen. Yeast bread 
should be twenty-four hours old; quick breads from 
twelve to twenty- four hours old. 

Except for formal occasions, crusts should not be re- 
moved. For that reason, bake bread to light rather than 
dark brown, and bake in pans that make slices of desirable 
shape and size. For teas and receptions, the bread should 
be sliced as thin as possible; for substantial sandwiches, 
cut it from one-fourth to one-third inch in thickness. 

Cream thoroughly butter or any kind of margarine; 
spread the bread evenly to its very edge, but for recep- 
tions and teas, be careful that there is no butter on the 
edge to soil gloves. Cover the bread evenly to the very 
edge with as thick a layer of filling as circumstances 
permit. It should not soak through or run over the edge, 
but should be sufficient to flavor the sandwich well, or to 
furnish the desired amount of food material if it is the 
main dish. Unless meats are very tender, they should be 
chopped rather than sliced.

This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe. 

About Google Book Search 

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and to make it universally accessible and useful. Google Book Search helps readers

PREFACE 

From the very day of America's awakening to the need 
of conservation, the members of the School of Domestic 
Science have entered heartily and enthusiastically into 
each succeeding plan of the Administration for conserv- 
ing the foods needed by our Allies. In order to do not only 
"our bit," but our utmost, radical changes have been made 
in the School menus, and much time has been given by 
teachers and by students of the Class of 1918 to experi- 
mental cookery with th^ various substitutes. In preparing 
the recipes, two definite objects have been kept in mind : 
the one to simplify for institutions the problem of provid- 
ing satisfactory meals with less sugar, less fat, and less 
wheat; the other to enable them to do so at minimum 
expense. 

The results of these months of work are embodied in 
"More Recipes for Fifty," and it is hoped that the book 
will be valuable in the years to come, as well as during 
these fateful years of the great World War.

INTRODUCTION 

A recipe, called to judgment, must answer three 
questions : 

Is it practical? 

Is it economical? 

Is the result attractive? 

These questions have to be answered in the affirmative 
when the recipes are planned for small groups. The 
answers must be still more emphatic when cooking is 
done for half a hundred. 

The first book by Miss Smith has proved its rare value 
to the many dietitians and institution managers who have 
used it. The second carries the added merit of adjustment 
to our increased list of staples. 

Before the war, we were in a rut in our kitchens. We 
used wheat, meat, sugar, and fats thoughtlessly and 
monotonously. Now, happily, cooking is lifted out of this 
dull routine. It has become a real adventure. 

On any new trail, however, we need a guide who has 
thoroughly explored the danger points and can guard us 
against them. 

Repeated experiments with what, in the first days of 
the world struggle, we called "substitutes** have produced 
the recipes in this book. They make a reliable and com- 
plete collection of palatable dishes which are not only 
good in theory, but entirely satisfactory in practice.

FRUITS 

Dried Fruits 

If properly cooked, dried fruits are a delicious and 
convenient form of fruit for winter use. Comparatively 
few people, however, cook dried fruits properly, and the 
result is a strong prejudice against them. At a time when 
the preservation of all food is so essential, and containers 
are so increasingly scarce, dried fruit comes to its own. 

It should be used freely: for breakfast fruit, for 
luncheon and supper desserts, for ices and sherbets, and 
for other dinner desserts. Often a combination of two 
fruits makes a pleasant variety; as dried apples and 
raisins, or prunes and apricots. 

Wash fruit thoroughly in cold water; drain. Add cold 
water to cover, and let soak from one to three days in a 
cold place ; the drier and harder the fruit, the longer the 
time required for soaking. Bring slowly to the boiling 
point, and without stirring cook in double boiler or in 
fireless cooker two or more hours, or until fruit is per- 
fectly tender, but unbroken. Sprinkle sugar or syrup over 
top of fruit, and cook twenty or thirty minutes longer ; 
do not stir. A little salt added to the water before cooking 
is often an improvement; add lemon, spices, or other 
seasoning at same time if used. Com syrup may be used 
in place of part or all of the sugar. Sweet, well-ripened 
fruits require little or no sugar. If the juice is watery 
and flavorless after cooking the fruit, turn it into a sepa- 
rate saucepan, and boil down to desired consistency.

Cranberry Bananas 

50 bananas 3 cups cranberry juice 

i cup margarine i cup or more corn S3rrup 

Left-over cranberry juice may be used, In which case 
no syrup will be needed. If bananas are to be used with 
meat, less sweetening will be required than when served 
as dessert. The margarine may be omitted. Peel bananas, 
place in shallow agate pans ; dot over with bits of mar- 
garine, add half the syrup. Bake thirty minutes or imtil 
done, basting occasionally with remaining syrup. 

Sliced Bananas with Fruit Juice 

Allow one medium-sized banana to each person. Slice 
into sauce dishes ; dip over fruit two or three tablespoons 
cranberry juice which has been sweetened with corn S)rrup. 
Cherry, red raspberry, or red currant juice may be used. 
Or serve half a banana to each person, and with it red 
currants, cut oranges, or strawberries, which have stood 
in sugar an hour or so; or stewed cranberries or peaches.

evaporates ; there should be one and one-half quarts when 
done. Mix cornstarch, salt, and a little cold water which 
has been saved out. Add boiling raisin water and symp, 
boil two minutes; add vinegar or lemon juice, bring to 
boil, and pour over bananas. Bake in hot oven thirty 
minutes, or until bananas are done. Serve as dessert. The 
bananas may be baked separately, and sauce poured over 
them when served. In that case, boil sauce five minutes.

Apples, Italian Style 

Choose large, juicy, well-flavored apples, attractive in 
appearance. Wash and polish well, and serve in fruit dish. 
Pass with them Neufchatel, cottage, Roquefort, Young 
America, or any cheese that is not hard and dry. Cut 
apples in slices, and spread with cheese. Serve for luncheon 
dessert. 

Apples Baked with Syrup 

50 large, tart apples i J quarts thick maple or 

i^ quarts water brown sugar syrup 

Wash and core apples, and if skins are tough, pare the 
upper half. If possible, bake apples in baking pans that 
can be covered. Add one teaspoon salt and boiling water 
to syrup, pour over apples, and bake in rather hot oven 
an hour or more. They should be perfectly soft, even if 
they cook to pieces. If some apples are done first, remove 
from pan, and continue cooking the others. If juice seems 
watery, boil a few minutes after removing apples. Pour 
juice over apples, and chill. Serve for dessert. If apples 
are used for breakfast, one quart syrup is sufficient. 

- Baked Apples De Luxe 

18 pounds tart apples i teaspoon salt 

2 quarts brown sugar i bunch mint leaves

Do not use apples that cook to pieces easily. Com syrup 
may be used in place of sugar by leaving out one pint of 
water. Cut yellow peel of lemons in small pieces. Wash 
mint, and allow about two leaves to each apple. Pare, core, 
and halve apples. Put into large kettle or bean pots. Bring 
sugar and water to boil ; add mint, lemon, and salt. Pour

syrup, salt, and lemon juice in kettle ; heat slowly, then boil 
until juice jellies. Cool partly, stir in dry celery, and put 
in cold place to mold. If it does not harden, serve in sauce 
dishes. 

Summer Fruit Cups 

Fruit cups may be served as an appetizer or as dessert. 
For the former, two tablespoons of the mixed fruit and 
juice is sufficient for each person ; but for the latter, more 
generous servings should be allowed. Under existing 
conditions, it will be found possible many times to prepare 
fruit cups with less sugar or syrup than heretofore, 
sometimes even without any. Sugar should be made into 
a 'syrup, using half as much water as sugar, and boiling it 
two or three minutes before adding to fruit. White corn 
syrup, or honey may be used in place of sugar syrup. Cook 
currants, sour cherries, or other very acid fruit, in syrup 
four or five minutes, but simply pour hot s)rrup over 
raspberries, peaches, and other mild fruits. Let stand in 
syrup until ice cold. There are many delicious combina- 
tions available in native fruits from June to October: 
large strawberries cut in halves, sprinkled with powdered 
sugar, and chilled ; raspberries and currants ; diced water- 
melon and canned or fresh pineapple, with or without

lemon juice; blackberries flavored with lemon juice and 
nutmeg to taste; stoned cherries, with diced banana or 
pear or pineapple; cut peaches, stoned cherries, and a 
sprinkling of minced angelica. Sometimes a combination 
of three or four left-over fruits may be used. 

Winter Fruit Cups 

Winter fruit cups do not require syrup. Serve without 
sugar, or with powdered or granulated sugar sprinkled 
over prepared fruit before it is chilled. In order to save 
sugar, however, white corn syrup may be used instead. If 
sugar is used, do not allow more than two tablespoons 
to a large grapefruit. Peel grapefruit, separate sections 
from membrane, and cut in thirds; peel and separate 
oranges into sections, removing membrane ; peel bananas 
and cut in small dice. Winter fruits may be combined 
in various ways: grapefruit, Malaga grapes seeded and 
halved, and Maraschino cherries shredded or halved; 
grapefruit, canned pears, and preserved ginger chopped 
finely; oranges, lemon juice, and minced fresh mint; 
oranges, grapefruit, and bananas; oranges and apples; 
stewed figs cut in small pieces, lemon juice, peaches, and 
marshmallows.

SUBSTITUTES 

The problem of substitutes in cookery reduces itself 
to three factors: fat, sugar, and flour. 

FAT 

The first one is easily disposed of : use butter substi- 
tutes, oils, hardened oil, and clarified drippings in place 
of butter and lard in cooking. In substituting fats, it 
should be remembered that seven-eighths of a cup of oil 
or lard is the equivalent of one cup of butter; fourteen 
and one-half tablespoons of hardened oil is equivalent to 
sixteen tablespoons of butter. Also it is well to bear in 
mind that many of our cakes and prepared dishes have 
been richer in fat than at all necessary, so that it is often 
possible to cut down more or less the amount called for 
in pre-war recipes. 

SUGAR 

There are two ways of saving sugar : by making things 
less sweet, and by using molasses, syrups, or honey in 
place of all or a part of the required sugar. In nearly all 
of the dessert and cake recipes that we have been in the 
habit of using, the amount of sweetening may be reduced 
with satisfactory results. In substituting molasses and 
syrups for sugar, leave out as much liquid as there is 
molasses or syrup added. In using honey, deduct one- 
fifth cup of liquid for each cup of honey substituted. 
Dark cakes may be made without any sugar, or with a 
small amount of brown sugar in addition to the molasses

or syrnp used. Add one teaspoon of soda for each cup of 
molasses substituted for sugar. 

FLOUR 

At first, the substitution of unfamiliar flours for wheat 
flour presents serious difficulties, but the acquisition of 
a few fundamental principles and a little practical ex- 
perience soon enables one to use substitute flours very 
satisfactorily. 

Com flour is a new acquaintance to most of us, but 
com meal is an old friend, although one whose possibilities 
we have never realized. In some sections we have been 
confined to white meal, in others to yellow meal. Now 
we have increasingly available both white and yellow 
flour, as well as white and yellow meal. In substituting 
com products for wheat flour, use from three- fourths to 
seven-eighths as much. Com flour and com meal give the 
best results when combined with one-third or one-half 
wheat flour, as they contain so little gluten; but very 
satisfactory quick breads and sponge cake may be made 
wholly of com. 

Barley flour, in particular, has been the bane of the 
housewife. The first barley flour put on the market was 
all barley, but now, under government regulation, three 
or four per cent wheat is added ; and the result is a flour 
which can be used alone or in large part in almost every- 
thing but yeast bread. The product is, of course, much 
darker, and has the characteristic barley taste unless 
counteracted by other flavors, but in time we shall become 
accustomed to that and think nothing of it. 

For yeast bread, from twenty-five to fifty per cent 
wheat flour is needed in order to give a satisfactory loaf. 
In many cases, a mixture of two or more substitutes gives 



Digitized by VjjOOQIC 



SUBSTITUTES II 

better results than one alone. Brown gravies and sauces, 
muffins, biscuits, noodles, dark cakes, sponge cakes, and 
many puddings may be made wholly of barley flour. 

A good deal is being said about the acid in barley, and 
the necessity for using limewater or some other agent to 
counteract it. When it is remembered that entire wheat 
flour and corn products contain almost as much acid as 
barley, the necessity for neutralizing it in the one case, 
when it is not done in the other, seems still an open 
question. Yeast bread made with barley flour may have 
a slightly acid, but not unpleasant, flavor which increases 
as the bread grows older; but baking powder and soda 
mixtures have no noticeable acid taste. 

With such substitutes as cornstarch, potato flour, and 
rice flour, it is necessary in many cases to use from 
twenty-five to fifty per cent wheat, barley, or rye flour, 
to furnish gluten enough to make them stand up. Sponge 
and angel cakes may be made wholly of starch flours; 
"butter" cakes, muffins, and similar doughs requiring a 
large number of eggs, may be made with at least half of 
such flours. 

In making over old recipes, or for reversing the process 
when the war is over, the following table gives approxi- 
mately the amount of substitute flour to use in place of 
pastry flour, as that is the kind of wheat flour generally 
used in baking powder mixtures. In substituting for 
bread flour, use two tablespoons more to a cup than when 
substituting for pastry flour. For instance, use one cup 
instead of seven-eighths cup of barley.

For the present, at least, it is more patriotic to use 
largely the so-called "quick breads" in place of yeast 
bread. Since they do not keep as well, it is necessary to 
bake less and oftener. Steamed breads have an advantage 
over baked ones in the longer cooking, which makes them 
more digestible. Left-over mufiins, com bread, and other 
quick breads may be toasted. 

Wheat, barley, rye, and corn flour should be sifted 
before measuring; granulated corn meal and the starches, 
such as cornstarch and potato flour, may be used without. 

The ntunber of eggs used may be increased or decreased 
to suit prevailing conditions. If fewer eggs are used, add 
one teaspoon baking powder and two tablespoons liquid 
for each one omitted. If the number is increased, reverse 
the process, omitting the same amount of baking powder 
and liquid. 

Milk for cooking is always skim milk, unless otherwise 
specified. Water may be substituted for milk if necessary ; 
and sour milk for buttermilk, or the reverse.

clear fat on top of stock, and thicken stock with one and 
one-half cups barley flour mixed until smooth with a little 
cooled stock. Add to meat to come nearly to top ; reserve 
remainder to pass with pie. Cover meat with any Meat

added gradually, in order that the dough shall not be too 
soft to handle. In all cases, however, it should be as soft 
as possible. Sift dry ingredients, rub or cut in shortening.

Maryland Chicken 

Dress, singe, and clean roasting chickens ; there should 
be about twenty-five pounds after they are dressed. Cut 
in pieces for serving. Roll in salted barley flour, saute in 
pork fat or cooking oil till golden brown ; remove to kettle. 
Add one and one-half cups barley or bread flour to fat in 
frying pan, stirring while it browns. Add to three quarts 
hot milk, stirring till smooth; cook fifteen minutes in 
double boiler, add one tablespoon salt and one teaspoon 
pepper. Turn sauce over chicken, and simmer from 
thirty to sixty minutes, according to age of chicken. Cook 
in oven, with two or three asbestos mats or grates under 
kettle to prevent burning. Garnish with chopped parsley, 
and serve with boiled rice. 

To Try Out Fat 

Cut suet, tallow, or trimmings of fresh fat pork in small 
pieces, or put through meat chopper. Soak mutton or 
chicken fat for twenty-four hours in cold salted water, 
changing water several times to remove the objectionable 
flavor ; drain well before heating. Cook slowly in oven 
or double boiler for several hours. When fat is melted, 
strain through cheesecloth, pressing to obtain all the fat. 
Keep in cool place. 

The addition of one part cottonseed oil to three parts 
strained fat makes a good cooking fat. 

Save the scraps or crackling to use in suet puddings, 
gingerbread, or hash. 

To Deodorize and Clarify Fats 

Any liquor in which meat has been boiled should be 
allowed to stand until the fat has risen to the top and

solidified. Remove fat to saucepan, scraping off sediment 
or particles of meat that cling to the bottom, then clarify 
and deodorize by any of the following methods : 

Add about a teaspoon soda to each quart of fat, barely 
cover with cold water, and cook very slowly until the 
water has evaporated ; add soda and a sliced raw potato, 
omitting water, and cook slowly until all bubbling ceases ; 
put a piece of charcoal in pan with the fat, and heat until 
there is no bubbling; add half a cup mild vinegar to a 
quart or more fat, and cook slowly until it has evaporated. 
Strain and cool. A mixture of several kinds of fat may 
be treated, instead of taking them separately. 

Savory Fat 

4 pounds fat : sausage, i tablespoon salt 

mutton, ham, veal 4 sliced apples 

I cup chopped onion i tablespoon sage 

If fat IS salty, omit part or all of salt. If preferred, a 
mixture of sage, thyme, and marjoram may be used. 
Cook ingredients together slowly until soft ; strain, and let 
harden. Use in cooking meats, vegetables, soups, hash, 
and gravies whenever a highly seasoned dish is wanted. 

Bacon should be kept separate, and used in dishes re- 
quiring bacon flavor.

Spring Greens 

There are many common, so-called weeds that furnish 
appetizing greens for those who have no early greens in 
the garden. Every locality can furnish one or more 
of these edible weeds, in addition to the ever present 
dandelion. 

Pigweed, or lamb's quarters, makes good greens when 
young and tender, and is found wherever there is culti- 
vated land. It may be used alone or in combination with 
other greens, and is cooked like spinach. Dandelions 
should be gathered before the flower bud makes much 
growth, and may be cooked like other greens or served 
raw as a salad. The marsh marigold, or cowslip, found 
in marshy places, is prepared like spinach ; also purslane, 
or "pusley." Sorrel, a common wayside weed in many 
localities, may be used alone, or in combination as a salad ; 
or cooked with dandelion, which makes a pleasing com- 
bination. Mustard should be used when young, either 
alone or in combination with greens of a mild flavor, such 
as purslane or pigweed. Very young, crisp mustard leaves 
make a good salad green. Milkweed is one of the most 
valuable of the edible weeds, and, unlike many of them, 
may be used throughout the season. Early in the spring, 
the young stem may be used ; later, only the branches are

asparagus, with either melted butter or a white sauce. 
The branches are usually cooked like spinach.

SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 

There are three types of salad in common use: the 
light or "green" salad of lettuce or other salad plants, 
cucumbers, tomatoes, or radishes; the substantial salad 
of meats, fish, or nutritious vegetables ; and the fruit or 
cheese salad, suitable for dessert. 

In the recipes that follow, the fruit salads, and a few 
other kinds, are usually given without definite amounts. 
The size of fruits and the desired size of servings deter- 
mine the amount. For instance, half an egg or a whole 
egg maybe allowed to each person. If pears or peaches 
are large, half of one makes a fair-sized serving; but if 
fruit is small, or servings are to be large, one and one-half 
or two must be allowed to each. If lettuce is to be served 
alone, at least nine large heads are needed; if used as 
foundation or garnish, six large heads are sufficient, unless 
servings are to be very generous in size. 

Wash salad plants thoroughly, and keep in cold place 
until served. Marinate vegetables and meats for an hour 
or more in freshly made or left-over French Dressing. 
Do not add dressing to green salads till just before serv- 
ing, as they wilt very quickly. 

If parsley (or lettuce) is washed and kept in tightly 
covered receptacle, it will keep fresh and crisp for some 
time. 

There are several oils, besides olive oil, that are suitable 
and satisfactory for marinating salads, and for dressings ; 
cottonseed, peanut, and com oil are particularly good.

SANDWICHES 

There are two types of sandwiches in common use: 
the substantial sandwich, which makes the main dish for 
luncheon or supper; and the small, dainty sandwich, 
served at afternoon teas and receptions. 

Breads of all kinds may be used for sandwiches : white 
and dark yeast breads, and quick breads made with baking 
powder or soda. The latter do not slice as well, but other- 
wise make very satisfactory sandwiches. To use with 
meat or fish, a bread made without molasses or a notice- 
able amount of sugar should be chosen. Yeast bread 
should be twenty- four hours old; quick breads from 
twelve to twenty-four hours old. 

Except for formal occasions, crusts should not be re- 
moved. For that reason, bake bread to light rather than 
dark brown, and bake in pans that make slices of desirable 
shape and size. For teas and receptions, the bread should 
be sliced as thin as possible ; for substantial sandwiches, 
cut it from one-fourth to one-third inch in thickness. 

Cream thoroughly butter or any kind of margarine; 
spread the bread evenly to its very edge, but for recep- 
tions and teas, be careful that there is no butter on the 
edge to soil gloves. Cover the bread evenly to the very 
edge with as thick a layer of filling as circumstances 
permit. It should not soak through or run over the edge, 
but should be sufficient to flavor the sandwich well, or to 
furnish the desired amount of food material if it is the 
main dish. Unless meats are very tender, they should be 
chopped rather than sliced.
