PREFACE 



Within the covers of this book will 
be found recipes for all kinds of 
"tasty dishes." Each one offered 
has been tested by competent 

housewives It is put forth with 

the certain belief that a fair trial 
will prove it to have a genuine 
and permanent place among 
books of its kind . 



SOUPS 

The first and most important point in making good 
soup is to have the best of materials. Soft cold water is 
necessary r , and it should not boil but simmer, and should 
always be made in a porcelain-lined or granite soup- 
kettle. 

SOUP STOCK. 

Cut the meat from the bones, and 
place the bones in the bottom of the 
kettle, lay the meat on top of them, add 
water and stand on the back part of the 
range for one hour. Then place over a 
good fire. Soon the scum will form on 
top. Skim, cover kettle closely and let 
it simmer (not boil) four hours. Then 
add vegetables and simmer one hour 
longer. Strain, add salt and put at 
once in a cool place. When cold take 
all the grease from the surface and it is 
ready for use. Mrs. S. T. Rorer.

beaten yolk of egg and serve imme- 
diately. 

CREAM OF RICE SOUP. 

Wash the rice carefully; add it to the 
cold stock with bay leaf, onion and 
celery. Simmer slowly two hours and 
press through sieve. Return to soup 
kettle, and add cream, butter, salt and 
pepper. When it comes to the boil, it 
is ready to serve

BEAN SOUP. 

Put beans (dark red Mexican with 
white eye) to soak over night, and in 
the morning boil till tender. Have a 
stock made by simmering beef bone, 
bacon, celery and onions for three 
hours. Mash beans through a colan- 
der and add to stock; season to taste 
wjth salt and pepper. Place croutons in 
a soup-tureen and pour in the soup. 
Dried Lima beans used in the same way 
make a very nourishing and savory 
soup. Mrs. A.J.Johnston.

Take the turkey bones, cook for one 
hour in water enough to cover, strain 
and stir in a little of the dressing, a 
beaten egg and a little chopped celery. 
Take from the fire and add butter, salt 
and pepper. 

SOUTHERN GUMBO SOUP. 

(As made by our old Auntie Mary.) 

Prepare your chicken, crabs, etc., as 
for soup or stew. Cut a slice of ham 
into small pieces. Put tablespoonful of 
lard into an iron pot ; add one onion, 
red pepper and salt to taste. Sprinkle 
the fowl, etc., with flour, and let it 
remain until nicely browned, after 
which put in water as for soup. Let it 
boil for three or four hours. Just 
before serving add your filet (dried sas- 
safras) or okra ; thicken with this to 
your taste ; serve with rice. 

Mrs. Ella P. Howe. 



% Ib. can nut soup 

stock, 

6% c. water, 
21/2 doz. ripe olives ; 
4 tsp. arrowroot, 
2 tsp. salt. 



NUT AND RIPE OLIVE SOUP. 

Slice the "San Juan" ripe pickled 
olives and cook fifteen minutes in three- 
fourths of a cup of water. Combine the 
blended stock and cooked olives, heat 
to boiling, stir in the arrowroot, let all 
boil up well, and salt and serve. The 
nut soup stock may be had at your 
grocer's, or you can make it, using 
one-half cup of nut butter, rubbing it 
smooth, adding water slowly. 



Yz c. nut butter, 
2 c. tomato, 
5 c. water, 
salt to taste. 



NUT AND TOMATO BISQUE. 

Rub the nut butter smooth with the 
tomato. Add the water Heat to boil- 
ing, and add salt enough to destroy the 
acid taste of the tomato about four 
teaspoonfuls. 



/ c. bran, 
3 pts. ivater. 



BRAN SOUP STOCK. 
For every quart of stock desired boil 
a cup of wheat bran in three pints of 
water for two or three hours, or until 
reduced one-third. This stock may be 
made the base of a variety of palatable 
and nutritious soups by flavoring with 
different vegetables, nut cream, and 
seasoning with salt. It is also valu- 
able in giving consistency to any soup, 
in the preparation of some of which it 
may be advantageously used in place 
of other liquid. 



"The chief pleasure (in eating] does not consist in 
costly seasoning or exquisite flavor, but in yourself . Do 
not seek for sauce by sweating" HORACE. 

SALADS 

Always remember the great rule in cookery, and that 
is that appearances are nine-tenths of any Sis h. Garnish 
your salad with pieces of lemon, hard-boiled eggs, olives, 
capers, pirsley, slices of pickle, and for your fruit and 
nut salads use slices of banana and pieces of whole shelled 
walnuts. The greatest thing for a salad-maker to remem- 
ber is that never under any consideration should they 
add the dressing to the salad until just before serving; 
if they do, they will find that it has a tendency to wilt 
the vegetables, making the salad a soft and insipid mass. 

FRUIT AND NUT SALAD. 
Peel and cut the fruit into small 
slices, add nuts (chopped') and mix 
with cream dressing. Serve on lettuce, 
and dust over a little cayenne. Gar- 
nish with slices of lemon and whole 
nuts.

CRAB A LA CREOLE. 

The following proportions are for six 
persons : 

i. Four good-sized cooked crabs. 

(a] Break off and crack the legs well, 
so that the shell can easily be removed 
with fork and knife, or (horrible dictu) 
with the fingers. 

(b] Take out the body of each crab 
and cleanse it thoroughly in cold water. 
Then cut each body in half, along the 
center, and cut each 'half into four 
pieces. 

(c] In the back shell of each crab 



26 



will be found more or less yellowish 
liquor and white, creamy fat. Drain 
off the liquor and throw it away, but 
after doing this scoop out the fat and 
put it in a plate for future use. 

(d} Break off about half the back 
shell of one crab and roast it in the 
oven until brown. Don't burn it. 

2. Take a gallon or six-quart sauce- 
pan and brown two sliced onions, me- 
dium size, in a little butter. Then 
add to the onions one quart can of 
tomatoes, one green bell-pepper sliced, 
or four or five stalks of celery sliced, 
and six cloves. Let this cook for about 
fifteen minutes, until the flavor is ex- 
tracted from the cloves, pepper, or cel- 
ery. Then add the juice of two large 
lemons, and the rind, cut very thin, of 
half a lemon; sugar, one tablespoon; 
salt, one teaspoon ; tabasco, twenty 
drops; Worcester sauce, two table- 
spoons ; sherry, one cup (or white wine, 
one cup and a half) ; currie powder, 
half teaspoon; and the roasted crab 
shell beaten into pieces not smaller 
than a nickel. Let this all cook for 
about fifteen minutes, stirring it fre- 
quently to keep from burning. Then 
strain through a colander and put 
back the strained sauce into your 
saucepan. Now add the fat of the 
crabs, a tablespoonful of butter and 
enough flour or corn starch to thicken 
well. Then put in all your cracked 



27 



shank of beef, 
pork rinds, 
2 qts. water. 



I tbsp. olive oil, 
I tbsp. butter. 



and cut crab and let the whole get 
piping hot. Serve all the crab in a 
large bowl, and the portions in deep 
plates. It will be convenient to put on 
the table a large dish or two for the 
shells. C. L. Miel. 

HEAD CHEEwSE. 

Soak pork rinds over night and 
scrape. Boil with shank of beef in 
two quarts of water until it jellies, 
carefully skimming off grease. Chop 
meats, salt and pepper, add full amount 
of water and set apart to cool. 

CALVES' BRAINS. 

Soak in cold water two or three 
hours, then remove membrane. Drain 
or make as dry as possible. Put oil 
and butter in frying-pan, add brains, 
and cook slowly half an hour. The 
above is very nice, after frying in oil 
half an hour, to take out and dip in 
egg, roll in cracker crumbs and fry 
until brown. 

VEAL OR CHICKEN TERRAPIN. 

Boil veal until tender (or use cold 
roast). Have ready two hard-boiled 
eggs; chop and add to them Ai sauce. 
When sauce is done add chicken or 
veal, and stir in a small glass of sherry 
wine.

VEAL CROQUETTES. 

Mince fine one pint of cold cooked 
veal and season with salt, pepper, half 
a teaspoonful of onion juice and one 
teaspoonful of lemon juice. Put half a 
pint of milk in the frying-pan on the 
stove. Mix two tablespoonfuls of flour 
with three of olive oil until smooth, 
and stir into the milk as soon as it 
begins to boil. When the sauce is 
smooth and thick add the seasoned 
meat and cook three minutes. Beat 
three eggs together and pour half over 
the cooking meat. Take from the fire 
at once and stir well; set aside to cool. 
When cold form into croquettes about 
the size of an egg. Roll them in the 
remainder of the beaten eggs, then in 
bread crumbs. Put in the frying- 
basket, but do not crowd. Have hot 
olive oil in the frying-kettle about four 
inches deep, and plunge the basket 
with the croquettes into this and cook 
for two minutes. Drain on brown 
paper for a minute and serve at once. 
Any kind of meat or fish can be sub- 
stituted for the veal. 

SWEETBREAD CROQUETTES. 

After parboiling the sweetbreads, 
stew them slowly in a little soup-stock 
or water. Mix a tablespoonful of corn- 
starch, a cup of water, i tablespoonful 
of vinegar, T teacupful of cream and 2

beaten eggs. Put over the fire and stir 
until thick. Season with salt and pep- 
per, celery, nutmeg and parsley. Chop 
the sweetbreads very fine and stir into 
the above, and boil for five minutes. 
Spread on a flat dish to cool, then cut 
in pieces, roll in bread crumbs and fry 
in hot olive oil. 

FRIED APPLES. 

Pare and cut the apples into eighths 
(being careful to take out the seeds and 
the core), and dust lightly with flour. 
Heat some El Dorado or San Juan olive 
oil in the frying-pan, put the apples in 
and fry until they are a light brown. 
Drain off the oil, sprinkle with sugar, 
and pile on a hot dish. A little cinna- 
mon mixed with the sugar is very nice. 
Brown bread buttered is very nice 
served with them. 

OLIVE PATTIES. 

To a rich cream gravy add one pint 
pitted Sylmar olives and one pint oys- 
ters. Heat thoroughly and serve in 
patties. Season to taste. 

CHICKEN SAUTE. 

Stew chicken until it will drop from 
the bones. Remove all the meat, chop 
and return to the liquor. Add toma- 
toes, olives (chopped), mushrooms and 
seasoning, and simmer three hours.

An Original Way to Use Stale Bread. 
Very Good. 

For a small family make a "one-egg 
batter," using no sugar. Have the 
bread sliced, dip into the batter, which 
must be thick enough to remain on the 
bread when lifted out, and fry in deep, 
hot fat. They puff up like doughnuts, 
but the bread loses itself in the cooking. 
Serve with maple syrup or powdered 
sugar. Mrs. S. B. Slight.

in the left hand, wet the forefinger of 
right hand and. ,dip into the boiling 
chocolate and then plunge into the cold 
water in the cup. It will not burn the 
finger. When the candy hardens to 
the breaking point as it is put into the

BREAD 

"Behind the nutty loaf is the mill-wheel; behind the 
mill is the wheat-field; on the wheat-field rests the sun- 
light; above the sun is God." 

BREAD. 

(An Original Way to Use Stale Bread. 
Very Good.} 

For a small family make a "one egg 
batter," using no sugar. Have the 
bread sliced, dip into the batter, which 
must be thick enough to remain on the 
bread when lifted out, and fry in deep, 
hot fat. They puff up like doughnuts, 
but the bread loses itself in the cook- 
ing. Serve with maple syrup or pow- 
dered sugar. 

BREAD. 
(Breakfast Gems.} 

Sift flour, salt and baking powder to- 
gether. Into the milk drop the eggs 
and sugar and beat quickly; then add 
half the flour and melted butter; beat, 
and add the remainder of flour. Bake 
in well larded gem pans in a quick oven.

Twentieth Century 




EL DORADO OLIVE OIL 

can be freely used in all cooking oper- 
ations where butter or lard is called 
for, but as the oil makes a more perfect 
mixture, a less quantity should be used. 
In a general way no change is necessary 
in the methods followed, and muffins, 
fritters, cakes, and pastry made with 
EL DORADO OLIVE OIL will be more 
tender, more delicious and more 
easily digested 



USE 



Dl Dorado

and most wHolesome form of

American 

Grown 

Teas 



1. Because they are clean, being packed and cured by white labor. 

2. Because they have a better flavor and are superior to Oriental 
Teas imported into this Country. 

3. Because our Government in fostering this infant industry has 
spared no expense in getting the best seeds from the most 
famous tea gardens in the Orient. 

4. Because, American teas being planted on virgin soil are 
stronger, and consequently cheaper than the same grade of 
Japanese or Chinese Teas. 

We have secured the Agency for this Coast and should be 
pleased to correspond with you or call upon you personally.

GENUINE MEXICAN BEANS AS PREPARED IN MEXICO. 

Vsc pink beans, -which may lie procured at all grocery stores. 
To 2 cups of beans. ;iiii! I! cups of water and soak over night. 
If in a hurry one may boil beans without previous soaking, but 
the soaking reduces the time oi' cooking by one hour. Add 
a small onion ami boil gently until beans will mash between 
fingers. l)o not make the mistake of throwing away liquid 
in which beans are boiled. Into a frying pan, no less than 
two inches deep, place a large cooking spoonful of fresh lard. 
Allow it to become very hot (this is the secret of beans not 
being greasy after frying), and with a perforated spoon, lay 
the beans, free of liquid, gently into pan. During this pro- 
cess the pan may be moved to back of stove to avoid setting 
fire to lard, which will unavoidably spatter. After laying in 
as many bean* as will absorb lard, place pan again over hot 
fire and mix leans and lard thoroughly until beans appear to 
have a coating of lard and begin to burst. Add a cupful of 
liquid in which beans were boiled and gently crush beans with 
cooking spoon, but do not mash. Xow add remainder of 
liquid and allow to simmer on back of stove for about one-half 
hour, or until beans are of consistency desired-- cither with 
considerable liquid (but thick) or quite dry. Success de- 
pends upon ol serving the following rules: Do not add salt 
iini il beans are boiled soft. The onion is not perceptible after 
conking, only giving the beans the characteristic Mexican 
Taste which no spice can produce. Eave lard at boiling point. 
lie not 1 oil leans in tin. Prepared spices or Mexican Chile 
may be added after the last portion of liquid is used. Re- 
pealed warmings improve taste. If very (.try add a little. 
water and place in oven for a few minutes.

RULES FOR MAKING BREAD. 

Twice as much flour as wetting, is a good rule to follow, not 
to have bread too stiff. For four large loaves: 3 pints of 
liquid; butter or lard, size of an egg; tablespoon sugar; sail. 
to taste. Cold weather lequires more yeast than in warm 
weather. Bread is better raised slowly and not too warm. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

One and one half cupfuls sour milk, one half cupful sour 
cream, one cupful corn meal, and one cupful white flour, two 
cupfuls graham flour, one cupful syrup, salt to taste, two 
teaspoons soda. If sour cream is not obtainable use two 
cupfuls sour milk and one tablespoonful of butter melted. 
Steam three hours.

WHIPPED CREAM. 

In making whipped cie'gm, be sure to cool thi' cream below 
churning temperature (which ranges from 'i4 to 7 degivos 
Fahrenheit), or you ];.ay : get a dish of butter on hand; and the 
cooler, the quicker ir becomes thi. -I. ; only don't freeze it, of 
course. To a coffee cup of cream add the whites of two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a little flavoring extract; I/eat 
all together; an egg beoter will do the work tho most rapidly. 
This quantity will ma.lte a quart . bo-.vli'ul, after it is beaten so 
as to stand alone wntn dropped from off a spooii. The cream 
should be rather thick, and perfectly sweet. So you sec, you 
have a quart out of ,1 cupful, "by using the wliites of only two 
eggs with the cream.
