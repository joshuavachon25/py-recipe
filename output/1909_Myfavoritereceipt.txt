Receipt ''' for making the article named, and are published as received ivith the 
name and address of their contributors, tvho alone are entitled to credit and 
are responsible for their accuracy and value.

use of cream of tartar and soda, or soda and sour milk, that in all cases incom- 
parably better residts tvill be obtained by the use of the Royal Baking Powder 
instead of these ingredients. Cake, biscuit, rolls, muffins, griddle cakes, etc., 
will be made of finer flavor, more light, palatable and tvholesome tchen raised bp 
Royal Baking Powder than by any other agency. 

This collection of receipts tvill be found remarkable in many ivays, and ex- 
ceedingly valuable for the large amount and wide scope of the information it 
contahis.

highest amount of leavening gas found in all the powders tested and says: " The Royal is a 



i\ 



most excellent powder, of high strength and very uniform quality."

bones and skin, work in the potatoes, and moisten with 
the drawn butter until it is soft enough to mold, and yet 
will keep in shape; roll the balls in flour, and fry a 
golden brown in lard or clean drippings. Take from the 
fat as soon as done, lay in a colander, and shake gently, 
to free from all drops ; if any should remain, place them 
on a white paper to absorb them, and serve upon a hot 
plate. — Miss Mary A. Kcmpton, Millville, Mass.

prevent the ball:; from sticking. Do not let the balls 
touch one another. Have the fat hot, put the basket in 
it, and remove a; soon as the balls are nicely browned. 



Drain well, and put into a hot closet till all are cooked.

crumbs in alternate layers, sprinkling a very little salt 
and pepper on the fish layers, and put little bits of 
butter over it; finish the dish with bread-crumbs, on 
which place small bits of butter : pour over it slowly, in 
every direction and in a very fine stream, milk or thin 
cream, enough to moisten it, like scalloped oysters when 
baked. A good way is to let the dish stand a few mo- 
ments after putting milk on, then tip it over on one side, 
and if the milk comes to or nearly to the edge of the 
dish, there is too much on, and it will be too wet. Bake 
to a nice brown. — Mrs. Ernest E. Crcpin, Montague,

water. Brown some finely sliced onions in butter, add 
large spoonful flour and brown it a little ; pour over this 
the wine and water in which the fish was cooked, and 
add salt, pepper, nutmeg, teaspoon sugar, and thyme.

J/[eats, Meal Loaf, ^tews, gausage, etc. 



^^^EEF A IiA MODE.— 6 lbs. lower side of 
§1^1 round of beef; lard with fat pork cut in narrow, 
•"^■^ thin strips, rolled in parsley, onions, and dry 
mushrooms, all chopped fine: salt and pepper; lay a 
slice of fat pork in the bottom of your pot, the beef upon 
it with a small onion in which you have stuck 2 cloves, 
a small piece each of carrot and turnip (and, if liked, 
a piece of bay-leaf); 1 gill water; cover tight, cook 
very slowly from 5 to 6 hours ; when half done, turn it 
over, pour over the meat a wine-glass of brandy : cover 
tight again until done; be careful not to let it bum; 
strain the gravy ; serve hot. Very fine cold. A very 
old French receipt — Mrs. A. E. Johtison, Cranford, 
N.J. 

Boiled Flank of Beef.— Wash the flank, and 
make a dressing as for turkey, which spread over it, 
first having salted and peppered well ; then roll up and tie ; 
wind the twine around it several times to keep in place; 
then sew up in a cloth kept for that purpose ; put a small 
plate in the pot and put in the meat, then pour on it 
boiling water enough to cover, and boil gently 6 hours. 



When done, remove the cloth, but not the twine until 
stone cold; then cut in thin slices, and you will have 
alternate layers of meat and dressing. This is a nice dish 
for breakfast or KR&. — Mrs. Mary Hoff, Waukegan, III. 

Corned Beef. — Boil until soft enough to pull the

when the weights are on, it will come to the top of the 
meat; let stand unril cold, then cut in thin slices, and 
it is ready for the table. — Kate H. Fridley, Carlisle, Pa. 

Corned Beef. — Cook the beef in plenty of water, 
but the water should be boiling before the beef is put in ; 
then it holds all its juices, and is much nicer than put in 
cold water. I pour out some of the corned-beef water in 
another kettle for the turnips and cabbage, as I think they 
spoil the taste of the meat; I cook nothing in with the 
meat but potatoes ; your corned meat is much nicer to let 
it cool a little in the water before taking out. — Annie H. 
Presbrey, Steep Brook, Mass.

Meat Dumpling's. — To 1 qt. flour add 3 heaping

bones boiling briskly, have enough water to keep from 
burning, but not enough to cover them, pick up a hand- 
ful of dough, make into a ball ; flour each and drop on 
the meat. When all are in, cover, and do not lift the lid for 
20 minutes. Take up on a platter, dumphngs on the

the round, 3 pts. water, cold; boil, after skimming, 5 or 
6 hours, then take out the meat, and separate it from the

fork, and retuwi it to the liquor ; season with salt and . 
pepper (adding Royal Celery Salt, if agreeable) ; heat 
once more and pour into a mold. — Mrs. B. D. Alien, \

then another layer of meat; season with salt and pepper, 
dredge in some flour, put on water enough to make a '. 
gravy, then a top crust; bake 1 hour. — Mrs. Austin 
Wesscl, Albany, Wis. 



ReSTirrection Pie.— IMince the cold meat finely, 
put into stewpan with a small piece of butter, some

1 lemon ; stir over the fire till thoroughly hot through. 
Line a soup-plate with pastrj-, put in the mixture, cover

Pepper Pot (West Indian Receipt).— 1\h'i. cooked 
corned beef, 2 lbs. fried pork chops, 1 chicken cut up and 
boiled in 3 pts. of water until two-thirds done ; take it out 
and drain ; when cold, sprinkle with flour and fry light 
brown. Let the water the chicken .vas boiled in stand 
until cold and skim off the fat; then add to it half a pt 
of cassaripe, 8 green chillies or 4 red, 2 bay-leave? 
and a sprig of thyme tied together, 3 medium-sized 
onions previously fried and drained from fat. Let it 
boil up, take off any scum that may rise ; rub together a 
tablespoon each of flour, butter, and brown sugar, and 
stir it into the boiling liquor. Now put in the meats and 
simmer gently 45 minutes. This can be warmed up any 
number of times, and meat in it will keep good in the 
hottest weather. When cold, take off any fat that may 
rise. No mutton must be used, or fresh beef, and all 
meats must be cooked first. Pheasants, pigeons, ducks, 
and any white fowl can go in. It is better served in the 
pot in which it is warmed up — an earthenware one 
answers well. Salt pork can be used instead of fresh, by 
soaking and parboiling before frying. I believe bottles 
of cassaripe can be had easily in New York at West 
India stores. — Mrs. H. B. Morse, Shanghai, China.

mix in a little cold water, then boil 5 minutes, serve hot

water and drain for 2 or 3 successive times ; drain well 
and dip in flour, have spider with sufficient lard to keep 
the meat from sticking and when the spider and lard are 
hot, put in the floured slices and fry briskly ; it will be 
brown and crisp. — Mrs. Mary A. fF/Zf<7«, Minneapolis, 
Minn. 

Fried Salt Pork.— Cut salt pork in 3 slices; par- 
boil, throw off the water, and fry ; when done (not too 
well), have ready 1 large tablespoon flour, pressed 
smooth of all lumps, in a small quantity of milk or water; 
pour about 1 qt. hot water into this, stirring the while; 
now pour off all the grease but about 2 tablespoons, and 
then pour into the spider your flour and water, stirring it 
about 1 minute, or until it begins to rise in the spider. 
Pork friea this way will be found to be far more palatable 
than any other. — Mrs. .4. J. Fairchild, Aberdeen, 
Dak.

I'lie JVEost Wholesome that can be

The great perfection to which the Royal Baking Powder has been brought as a 
leavening agent has induced its use in lieu of yeast by many of the most expert 
bakers in the making of fine bread. 

It is found that it not only leavens the dough most perfectly, but that it makes the 
sweetest, finest flavored, most tender, delicious and wholesome bread possible to pro- 
duce. Old and celebrated bread-makers declare that it exceeds the most successful 
yeast bread they have ever made. The following receipt for making bread without 
yeast, using Royal Baking Powder to raise it, appears to be the favorite with lovers 
of good, wholesome, fresh bread. 

Please notice that it requires water for mixing the dough. Do not use milk. This 
receipt, using water, will be found, if carefully followed, to produce one loaf of ex- 
ceedingly handsome, light, sweet, wholesome bread, that will keep moist, fresh and 
sweet for many days :

4/4 by 8 inches, and 4 inches deep, filling about half full. The loaf will 
rise to fill the pan when baked. Bake in very hot oven 45 minutes, 
placing paper over first 15 minutes baking, to prevent crusting too soon 
on top. Bake immediately after mixing. 

* Perfect success can be had only with the Royal Baking Powder. 

Some of the advantages presented by this method of making 
bread with Royal Baking Powder are : 

The saving of the nutritious constituents of the _ Uniformity of result, while the result with yeast 

flour from consumption in the process of rising. is of doubtful issue, and in household production is 

Saving of time, ordinary yeast bread requiring more frequently indifferent than good, 

preparation over night, care for hours before bak- A bread that even persons of delicate digestive 

ing, and dependence on a variable supply of yeast, apparatus can use without the ills peculiar to fer» 

A bread that retains its moisture longer, and does mented bread following. 

not mold as readily. Bread that can be eaten warm with impunity, etc 

IT WILL PAY EVERY HOUSEKEEPER TO TRY THIS. 

The Royal Baking Powder Co. will thank those trying this receipt for information as to result.

Almond SpOUg-e Cake.— The addition of al- 
monds makes this cake very superior to the usual | 
sponge cake. Sift J^ lb. fine flour or arrowroot; blanch 
in scalding water 2 oz. sweet almonds, shelled, and 2 
oz. bitter ones, renewing the hot water when expedient; 
when the skins are all off, wash the almonds in cold 
water, mixing the sweet and bitter, and wipe them dry ; 
pound them to a fine smooth paste, one at a time, in a 
very clean marble mortar, adding, as you proceed, 
plenty of rose-water to prevent their oiling ; set in a cool 
place; beat 12 eggs till verj' smooth and thick, and then 
beat into them, gradually, 1 lb. powdered loaf-sugar, in 
turn with the pounded almonds ; lastly, add the flour, 
stirring it around slowly and lightly, on the surface of 
the mixture, as in common sponge cake ; have ready a 
deep square pan, block tin, butter it nicely, put the 
mixture carefully into it, set it into the oven and bake 
it until thoroughly done and risen very high ; when cool, 
cover it with plain white icing, flavored with rose-water; 
with sweet almonds always use a small portion of bitter 
ones; without them, my experience is, they have little or 
no taste, though they ada to the richness of the cake.

put in a clean towel to drain, then take as much white 
sugar as you have juice; boil until a drop will stick to a 
broom straw.— ^T/ri. W. S. Moffett, Ocoya, 111. 

Crab- Apple Jelly. — Select apples, wash and place 
in kettle with water enough to cover and boil until tender; 
place a piece of cheesecloth in colander, pour contents of 
kettle into it, gather up the comers and use a potato- 
masher instead of hand to strain ; put 1 cup sugar to 
2 cups syrup and boil 1 hour or more, only stirring until 
sugar is dissolved; place in glasses for cooling. — Mrs. 
C. L. Oh'n, Essex, Conn. 

Dried Apple Jelly. — 2 lbs. dried apples, soaked 
overnight, and stewed till soft in water enough to cover; 
then put a sieve in a pan and pour them in and let drain ; 
weigh the juice and add as many lbs. of sugar as there 
are lbs. of juice; boil till it will jelly. — Mrs. E. D. 
Stedwell, Eagle, Pa. 

Red Apple Jelly. — Take nice red apples (not too 
ripe, or they will make the jelly dark), wash, quarter, 
and core, but do not pare them ; put in a preserving- 
kettle with water enough to boil them well, turn them 
out into a hair-sieve; do not force them through, or jelly 
will not be clear; gently strain the juice through a bag, 
but be careful not to let any of the sediment in the bag 
go through ; put the juice on the stove and boil 10 or 15 
minutes; take 6 lbs. sugar for 9 lbs. juice, put back on 
the stove and boil a few minutes, and it is ready for the 
bowls ; stand 2 or 3 days without covering, then cover 
and keep in a dry place. — Mrs. Jos. N. King, Cabin 
Hill, N. Y. 

Currant Jelly. — Freshly picked currants are best ; 
place in earthen jar, set in hot water, heat till juice will 
separate, then strain; add equal parts sugar and juice: 
boil just seven minutes ; the jelly will be firm and light- 
colored. — Mrs. Geo. L. Blake, Plainville, Mass. 

Currant Jelly. — Weigh the currants without re- 
moving stems (do not wash them) ; to every lb. of fruit 
allow J4 lb. sugar, granulated or loaf; put a few cur- \ 
rants into a kettle, press with a potato-masher or any- \ 
thing convenient, in order to secure sufficient liquor to 
prevent burning, then add the remainder of the fruit and 
boil freely for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally ; take out 
and strain carefully through a flannel bag; do not put 
the liquid in tin, as it materially affects both color and 
flavor; when strained, return liquid to kettle without 
trouble of measuring; let it boil thoroughly for 1 or 2 
minutes, then add the sugar; the moment the sugar is 
dissolved the jelly is ready to put in glasses. — Mary A . 
Chainplin, Cameron, Mo. 

Currant Jelly. — Wash currants, mash in a 
porcelain dish, squeeze through jelly-bag, rinse out bag, 
run the juice through again without squeezing, then to 
every pt. of juice add 1 lb. sugar; while boiling, skim 
off scum and boil until stiff (20 minutes) : an excellent 
jelly is made by taking V^ currants, -j red raspberries, 
and proceeding as above ; these, taking J^ each, make 
a better preserve then either one alone. -~ Mrs. W, F. 
Pascoe, S. Easton, Pa. 

Currant Jelly. — Jam the currants and get the 
juice all out; boil the juice 5 minutes, the sugar being 
placed in the oven and heated very hot, then add sugar 
and boil 1 minute; 1 lb. sugar to 1 pt. juice. — Flora 
Tildeii, Covington, Pa. 

Elderberry Jelly. — 1 qt. elderberries, 1 pt. 
water ; boil together a few minutes, then press through a 
towel till all the juice is extracted; 1 qt. crab-apples and 



1 pt. water boiled together, and juice extracted in same 
way ; the apples should be cut once or twice through be- 
fore boiling; now mix the juice of both together, and to 
1 pt. juice take 1 lb. white sugar and boil about 10 or 15 
minutes till it will jelly nicely ; elderberry juice will not 
jelly when taken alone, but by adding the juice of apples 
it gives a beautiful jelly. — Mrs. D. N, Lehman, Lan- 
caster, Pa. 

Grape Jelly. — I prefer Concords, just turning 
purple ; place grapes in preserving-kettle with water to 
nearly cover them, stir often till they are all breaking 
open, then pour in jelly-bag and drain, but do not press 
thejuice out, weigh and return the juice to the fire, then 
weigh out as much sugar as there was of juice ; when the 
juice commences to boil, put in half the sugar, stir a little, 
when this boils, strain through a clean cloth and return 
again to the fire ; now, when it again boils, add the re- 
mainder of the weighed sugar, stir gently, and pour in 
glasses to cool for future use. I make other fruit jellies 
the same way ; take the grapes from the jelly-bag and 
press the pulp through a tin or fine sieve ; add as much 
sugar as you have of the pulp, and cook till done ; this 
makes a very good grape butter. — Mrs. Lima Collins, 
Chapman, Neb. 

Q-OOSeberry Jelly. — Bruise a quantity of goose- 
berries and pass them through a sieve, and add y[ of 
their weight in loaf sugar ; boil fruit with sugar to a jelly 
so thick that when dropped into a dish it will not adhere 
to it, then strain. — Miss Tillie Eurick, Prospect, O. 

Strawberry Jelly. — Squeeze the juice from 
freshly gathered berries, for the slightest tendency to 
fermentation will spoil the whole process ; let the juice 
drip, without squeezing, through a flannel bag; to each 
pt. of this clear juice allow y^ lb. sugar; put this syrup 
over a briskly burning fire, and boil hard just 20 minutes; 
stir as little as possible, and only at first, till the sugar is 
dissolved, and then always with a silver spoon ; do not 
attempt to make more than 3 or 4 lbs. of jelly at once, 
and attention to every little particular direction given is 
necessary to insure success. Jellying requires more pains 
than almost any other process of cookery ; strawberry 
jelly, when well made, more nearly resembles guava 
jelly than any other that can be prepared from the fruits 
of the temperate zone. — C. Maggie Meldahl, Scott, W. 
Va. 

Tomato Jelly. — 1 pk. yellow tomatoes, cut in 
pieces and boil until soft, strain through a cloth ; to every 
cup of juice take 2 cups sugar; put the juice on and let 
boil 20 minutes with 1 lemon sliced ; then add heated 
sugar and let boil 15 minutes longer ; treat the same as 
other jellies. — Mrs. Frank H. Weir, La Porte. 

Apple Marmalade. — Take sour apples, core but 
do not peel, put on the stove with enough cold water to 
cover and boil ; when cooked soft, strain through a colan- 
der to separate from the skins ; then take half as much 
sugar as strained apples, season with ground cloves and 
allspice, and boil until thick ; lay 2 slices of lemon in 
each jar before sealing. — Miss Ada Male, Delaware, O. 

Cranberry Marmalade. — Wash and pick over 
the berries, and to every qt. of fruit add 1 pt. water and 
cook 1 hour, stirring constantly ; then remove from fire, 
and to every qt. of berries add 1 teaspoon soda; stir and 
skim off the green froth that rises, then strain through a 
coarse sieve, and then to every cup of juice add 1 cup 
granulated sugar ; return to fire and cook J^ hour, then 
put in molds, and it is ready for use in 24 hours.— J/r.y. 
H. R. Severance, Scottsville, N. Y.

MY "FAVORITE RECEIPTS 



add 1 lb. white sugar and set in cool place, stirring 
frequently; when the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, 
strain and bottle ; no cooking is required; it destroys the 
fruit flavor; for use, mix in a glass with ice-water 
according to taste; nice in hot weather, or in sickness, 
particularly fevers. — C. C. Nicoll, New Haven, Conn. 

Raspberry Vineg-ar. — To l qt. white wine 
vinegar add 1 lb. crushed red raspberries ; put into a 
stone jar, and let it stand for 2 days, then strain the 
syrup and add 1 lb. sugar to each pt. of juice; let it 
simmer on the back of stove (not boil) for 2 hours, then 
bottle tightly; when used, 1 tablespoon will be found 
sufficient for 1 glass of water; very fine. — Mrs. A. I. 
Fairchild, Aberdeen, Dak. 



Good Stunmer Drink. — Select ripe, thin-skinned 
oranges, squeeze the juice through a sieve : to every 
pt. of this juice, add 1J4 lbs. sugar; boil it closely and 
skim as long as scum rises ; then take it off and bottle; 
a little of this in a glass of ice-water makes a de- 
licious, wholesome drink ; 2 tablespoons of this syrup 
mixed with melted butter make an admirable sauce for 
plum pudding. 

A Cup of Tea. — Take l heaping teaspoon green 
i Japan tea to each person, and add 1 for the teapot, pour 
on 2 cups boiling water, cover and set on back of stove 
where it will not boil ; let it stand 6 or 8 minutes, and

Corned Beef. — 4 lbs. brown sugar, and water 
enough to cover 100 lbs. meat ; bring to a boil, then add 
all the salt the water will dissolve while boiling, then 
skim the brine and put in the meat while boiling, and 
boil ]/2 hour, then take out the meat and let both meat 
and pickle get cold, then pack and pour on the pickle ; 
this is a superior receipt. — Mrs. J. F. Tlwmpson, West 
Rupert, Vt. 

To Com Beef. — Soak well 48 hours in weak 
brine ; to every 100 lbs. meat, 3 pts. Liverpool salt, 2 lbs.

To Cure Meats.— Take 16 gals, water, 16 qts. 
salt, 1 lb. saltpeter, 3 lbs. brown sugar ; boil all together 
for 15 minutes, stirring it well, remove the scum; when 
cold, it is ready for use; cleanse the meat, put it in 
brine, place a weight on it to keep the meat submerged : 
the weight must be the kind the salt cannot act upon ; 
the meat will be cured in 8 days; when the brine has 
been ti.sed for 4 picklings, boil and skim again, and 
when cold, it is ready for use ; it is fit for use so long as 
it will bear an egg.— Marie E. Goodwin, Kenneit 
Square, Pa. 

To Ctire Beef for Drying.— To every |30 lbs. 
allow 1 tablespoon saltpeter, 1 qt. salt, 1 pt. brown 
sugar ; mix with molasses till quite moist ; rub the 
pieces of meat with the mixture, and when done, let all 
stick to it that will; pack in a deep, narrow vessel, as a 
keg or 5^-barrel, that the pickle may cover the meat, 
and let remain 43 hours ; at the end of that time enough 
pickle will be formed to nearly cover the meat : take out 
and hang in a suitable place for drying; allow all the 
mixture to adhere to the meat that will. — Mrs. A . P. 
Sherman, Mansfield, Pa. 

Fickle for Beef. — Cut in small pieces, leaving out 
all the bone, and pack in large stone jars with a weight 
on top (a stone jar is the nicest vessel for this, and if one 
won't hold enough, get more) ; make a pickle in the 
proportion of 2 gallons of water, 2 lbs. salt, 1 oz. salt- 
peter, 1 lb. sugar, and 2 large spoons baking soda; 
boil, skim, and pour on hot; after 2 weeks take out the

Sug-ar-Cured Hams.— 80 lbs. meat, l qt. salt, 4 
oz. saltpeter, 1 pt. sugar; pulverize thoroughly; rub on 
three times inside of a week, and, if you cannot get all 
the mixture on in those rubbings, give it four; it .should 
all be used; hams will do to smoke inside of 15 days; 
same receipt for drying beef will make its own brine. ^ 
Mrs. H. ir. Smith. 

To Preserve Egrg'S. — Dip them in melted suet, 
olive oil, milk of lime, or solutions of gum-arabic, and 
pack them in bran, oats, meal, or salt. — Emma Dea/en- 
baugh, Belleville, III. 

To Pack Eggs for Winter.— Take a nail-keg 
and put in a layer of salt, about 3 inches deep, then put 
in a layer of fresh eggs, putting point down, being care- 
ful not to have them touch ; then another layer of salt, 
etc. , leaving a thick layer of salt on top ; I have never 
known the above to fail ; eggs that have been packed in 
September you 'could whip to a stiff froth in April. — 
Elsie B. Deeds, Lanark, 111. 

Universal Pickle.— 1 gal. vinegar, %, pt. salt, 2 
oz. each of spice, mace, cloves, ginger, white mustard

ROYAL THE ONLY ABSOLUTELY PURE BAKING POWDER. 

ROVAL is the only absolutely pure baking powder made. All other baking 
powders or bread preparations contain either lime or alum. 

The absolute purity of the " Royal " results from the exclusive use of chemically 
pure cream of tartar. This cream of tartar is refined by patent processes by which 
the tartrate of lime and all other impurities are totally eliminated. All other 
baking powders are made from cream of tartar refined in the old way, which inevita- 
bly leaves a large amount of lime in it. There being no inert matter in the Royal 
Baking Powder, higher strength is, of course, attained, as shown by the Govern- 
ment chemises' tests. 

The plant and patents for the production of chemically pure cream of tartar for 
use in the Royal Baking Powder, cost upwards of half a million dollars. The 
exclusive advantages thus employed enable this Company to guarantee not only 
absolute purity, but the only pure and perfect baking powder made. 

BOGUS BAKING POWDER TESTS. 

Disreputable tricks are frequently resorted to by the manufacturers of the 
numerous lime, alum, and other cheap baking powders to aid them in imposing 
their goods upon the public. These tricks so often partake of the nature of 
swindles, are presented with so much plausibility and practiced so dexterously, that 
safety from being cheated by them into buying dangerous articles of food lies only 
in refusing admission to your house to all baking powder samplers, peddlers, or 
pretended testers. 

A favorite trick of these people has been performed through the aid of troops of 
women employed, doubtless without knowing the serious character of the swindle 
they were engaged in, to practice it from house to house in the larger towns and 
cities. Their method consists in making what they call comparative tests of the 
baking powder used by the family and the one they are trying to introduce. These 
tests consist in heating the can of powder found in the kitchen over a lamp or gas 
jet, when, if the baking powder is good for anything, a gas apparent to the sense of 
smell is given off". A claim is made that this odor indicates something detrimental, 
although as a matter of fact the baking powder that gave off no gas when subjected 
to heat would prove itself without leavening power or value. They will then mix 
the baking powder given them with cold water. If pure, the gas will be given off" 
quickly and quietly. The baking powder these testers peddle is produced and 
similarly mixed with water, when it is found to foam up slowly, rising over the top 
of the glass, where it will stand for some time. This is claimed as evidence of 
superiority, whereas it is the exhibition of a trick only, as this effect is caused by 
the presence of flour or lime in the baking powder they are peddling, and is a 
clear evidence of adulteration. To prove this, fill a glass half full of water and mix 
together equal parts of flour and Royal or some other pure baking powder, pour 
into the water and stir quickly. The same effect will be produced. 

The chief object of this jugglery is to destroy the baking powder given for test- 
ing, or by heating it to drive off its leavening gases, and so weaken it that when used it 
will fail to work. The average tramp will in this way destroy from fifty to seventy- 
five pounds of baking powder in a day. 

Another trick is to add hot water to the two samples of baking powder to be 
tested. The baking powder off"ered by the testers will give off no odor, while that 

oo 



which it is their object to defame will probably exhale a perceptible gas. Here 
again deception is practiced. The best baking powders have a leavening power 
beyond that developed by cold water, which is given off by the heat of baking. A 
baking powder, therefore, which will produce no additional gas when hot water is 
added is lacking in strength and otherwise inferior. Bread and biscuit that con- 
tinue to rise while baking are lighter, finer, and more digestible. 

These testers, unless carefully watched, will dexterously throw into the can of 
baking powder given them for trial, salt, soda, or powdered lime with intent to 
destroy it. Should there be no baking powder in the house, the operators will 
produce a sample of that generally used which has been previously " doctored " to 
make such exhibit as they desire. 

These adulterated, lime and alum powders are frequently left in samples at the 
door for the purpose of introducing them, with circulars containing bogus analyses 
and certificates, and false representations as to their value. That fact alone is 
sufficient to condemn them. No manufacturer whose goods are of value can afford 
to give them away, and none but the cheapest, most inferior, and unmarketable 
goods require to be distributed free in order to get the public to use them. This 
method is adopted only by parties who have failed to dispose of their wares through 
the ordinary and legitimate channels of trade. Free samples of articles of food 
left at the house should be regarded with suspicion. There is no guarantee of 
their wholesomeness, while there is real danger that they contain a fatally poisonous 
compound. 

The only way to protect our food from being contaminated by the tramps, testers, 
and samplers is to turn all who wish or attempt to tamper with it unceremoniously 
from the door, to throw their goods away, and particularly to use no new, untried, 
and suspicious article. The Royal Baking Powder has been in use for twenty years ; 
its perfect purity and wholesomeness is guaranteed by hundreds of analyses and 
tests by Government chemists, Boards of Health, etc. Its merits have secured for it 
the constant patronage of the American people to an extent beyond the combined 
sale of all other baking powders. Careful housekeepers who desire pure and 
perfect food and regard the health of their families will use no other. 

ALL BULK BAKING POWDERS ARE UNSAFE. 

The public is cautioned against the practice of many grocers who sell what they 
claim to be Royal Baking Powder, loose or in bulk, without label or trade-mark. 
All such powders are base imitations. Analyses of hundreds of samples of baking 
powders sold in bulk to parties asking for Royal have shown them all to be largely 
adulterated, mostly with alum, dangerous for use in food, and comparatively 
valueless for leavening purposes. 

A favorite method of selling these poisonous alum baking powders is by placing 
them in an empty Royal Baking Powder can and weighing them out in small quan- 
tities when the Royal Baking Powder is called for by customers. 

The public is too well aware of the injurious effect of alum upon the system, to 
need further caution against the use of any baking powders known to be made from 
this drug; but the dealer's assurance, " Oh, it'sjust as good as Royal," or "It's the 
genuine Royal, only we buy it by the barrel to save expense of can," etc., is apt to 
mislead unsuspecting consumers into buying an article which they would not 
knowingly use in their food under any consideration. 

The Royal Baking Powder is sold only in cans, securely closed with the Company's 
trade-mark label, and the weight of package stamped on each cover. It is never 
sold in bulk, by the barrel, or loose by weight or measure, and all such offered the 

oo 



public, under any pretense, are imitations. No baking powder safe for use in food is 
ever sold in bulk or by weight. 

If consumers will bear these facts in mind, and also see that the package purchased 
is properly labeled and the label unbroken, they will be always sure of using a 
baking powder perfectly pure and wholesome, and of the highest test strength in 
the market. 

POISONOUS ALUM BAKING POWDERS — BITTER BREAD. 

Alum powders are injurious to health, and should under no consideration be used. 
These powders will be found on sale under various names in almost every grocery 
store. They are distinguished generally by their lower price or by having a gift 
offered with them. Biscuits made from alum baking powders also have a bitter taste, 
and when broken are more tougii than when made from a proper baking powder. 
Chemical analysis is the sure means of detecting them ; but when this cannot be 
had, the only safe way is to avoid all powders that are suspected of containing alum, 
all that are sold in bulk or by weight, or with presents, or below the price of a first- 
class article, and particularly all that leave a bitter taste in the food. 

It is not necessary to quote the numerous authorities as to the effects of alum 
"baking powders upon the system. Their use has been condemned by physicians, 
chemists, and scientists generally as dangerous, and so well understood and feared 
is this danger by the public that none of their proprietors dare to sell them for what 
they are — alum goods. 

The effect which alum has when taken into the mouth, familiar to every one, is 
the effect produced by it upon the coats of the stomach and intestines. Alum is 
classed by the medical dictionaries, in ordinary doses as an astringent, in larger 
doses as a purgative, emetic, and poison. The symptoms that follow its continued 
use are indigestion, heartburn, headache, dyspepsia, inflammation of the stomach, 
liver, and kidneys, and finally those serious disorders of these organs which medical 
treatment cannot reach. 

The Royal is the only baking powder that contains neither lime nor alum, and 
perfect safety lies only in its exclusive use. 

PRIZE BAKING POWDERS ARE DANGEROUS. 

All baking powders sold with a gift or present, or with a ticket or scheme for 
giving the purchaser a present, should be avoided. Baking powder makers will not 
give away articles of value for nothing — they make up the cost of these gifts by 
selling an inferior, cheaply made powder. 

It has been found upon analysis that these gift and prize powders are made from 
alum or other cheap ingredients. Alum powders cost less than four cents a pound 
to produce ; the gift or prize costs but a few cents more. They are sold at the price 
of a first-class powder, or but little less, so that the swindle in a commercial sense 
is enormous. The danger to the health of the consumer is, however, the more 
important consideration. 

DO NOT USE SALERATUS 

And sour milk, or cream of tartar and soda. It is impossible to procure pure cream 
of tartar from the grocers, and its use will result in unwholesome cake and biscuits. 
In all receipts where cream of tartar and soda or saleratus are called for, substitute 
Royal Baking Powder and get better results. The usual proportions in the old way 
were two teaspoons of cream of tartar to one of soda or saleratus, instead of 
which use two teaspoons of Royal Baking Powder and mix with flour while dry. 
Never use sour milk with Royal Baking Powder.
