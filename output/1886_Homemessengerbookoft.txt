PREFACE 

TO THE 

REVISED EDITION OF THE HOME MESSENGER RECEIPT BOOK. 



The Home Messenger Book of Tested Receipts was published 
somewhat hastily iu October, 1873, and several thousand found a 
ready sale. It contained 137 pages, or 380 receipts, sold without 
an agent for $1.25. 

In December, 1878, a second edition was brought out, 288 pages, 
801 receipts, price, $1.00, Total Abstinence principles. Five thousand 
were sold promptly, and for the past two years not a copy could be 
bought. The demand for a third edition has been so great that we 
now issued the present book, which is, by far, the best of all. 

The effort has been to give exact measures in cups and table- 
spoons rather than weighing the articles. It is a significant fact 
that the cooks, either amateur or professional, are the ones who 
demand the book. This third edition contains 288 pages, 810 
Receipts ; price, $1.00, Total Abstinence. The very best of the 
old receipts have been retained, and new ones from such practical 
cooks as Miss Parloa, .Marg'M-y Daw, Mrs. Welch, Warne's Great 
English Book, The National Training School of Cookery in 
England, Mrs. Henderson, The Virginia Cook Book, transla- 
tions of tested French receipts, etc. It will find its way into thous- 
ands of homes in Michigan and in the United States generally. 
We bespeak for it your confidence, because it is indeed an advance 
in gastronomic art and science; for these receipts have been tried, 
tested, criticised and reformed, until in a plain and practical way 
we consider them faultless. 

By the exercise of forethought much better meals can be had 
with far greater economy. Decide as far as possible the nicjht before 



iv PREFACE. 

what are to be your meals for the following day; by this me;ms you 
can use yeast instead of baking powder, have cold tapioca puddings 
or well-set creams and your soup stocks on hand, etc. Nothing 
is wiser policy than to face the inevitable in time, for like seed 
time and harvest (only far more frequently), come Breakfast, Din- 
ner and Supper. 

No cookery book alone will make a good cook. Judgment in 
baking, boiling, stewing, frying and compounding is only to be 
attained by experience; but the acquisition of that experience may 
be greatly expedited by such instructions as are to be found herein. 
Here are receipts that will enable any lady to get up for her own 
family, or ceremonious guests, a delightful breakfast, lunch, dinner 
■or tea, a tea-company, or large evening entertainment. We have 
endeavored to make them so explicit that a lady can follow them her- 
self, or stand by her cook, and see that she follows them.

COFFEE. TEA and CHOCOLATE. 



1 Good New England Coffee. 

For a family of six take six large tablespoonfuls of best 
Java coffee, well browned and ground (not too fine), beat 
into it half an egg and one cup of cold water. After it is 
thoroughly beaten, let it stand half an hour, well covered. 
Then put into coffee pot, pour on two-and-a-half quarts of 
boiling water and put on the stove, stir once or twice at 
first, to prevent burning. Let it scald fifteen or twenty 
minutes. If desired to be very nice, beat up eight instead 
of six tablespoonfuls coffee; put six in the pot to boil 
twenty minutes, and about five minutes before it is done, 
throw in the rest and cover quickly. 

2 Vienna Coffee. 

With very little extra trouble morning coffee can be 
greatly improved. Beat the white of an O;^^ to a stiff 
froth, mix with an equal quantity of whipped cream, and 
use in coffee instead of cream; put in cream first, then 
coffee, and lastly this mixture. 

3 Soyer's Cafe an Lait. 

One cup of best coffee, freshly roasted, but unground, 
two cups of boiling water, one quart of boiling milk. Put 
the coffee in a clean, dry kettle, or tin pail; fit on a close 



2 COFFEE, TEA. AND CHOCOLATE. 

top, and set in a sauce-pan of boiling water. Shake it every 
few minutes, without opening it, until you judge that the 
coffee grains must be heated through. If, on lifting the 
cover, you find that the contents of the inner vessel are 
very hot and smoking, pour over them the boiling water 
directly from the tea-kettle. Cover the inner vessel closely, 
and set on the side of the range, where it will keep very 
hot, without boiling, for twenty minutes. Then add the 
boiling milk; let all stand together for five minutes more, 
and strain through thin muslin into the coffee urn. Use 
loaf sugar for sweetening. 



4 Coffee for Two Persons. 

Four rounding teaspoonfuls of coffee tied up in a piece 
of Swiss muslin (leave plenty of room for expansion), pour 
on two cups of bubbling, boiling water, cover close and 
set back on the range about ten minutes. Break one egg 
in a large coffee cup, give it a good whip with a dover 
egg-beater, divide it half in each cup, add the usual 
quantity of sugar, pour on the hot coffee, add warm milk 
and one spoonful of cream, and with the golden foam 
standing one inch above the rim of the cup you will think 
it too pretty to d?ink, and when you taste it will say you 
never knew how good coffee was before. 



5 Cream and Milk for Coffee. 

Sweet rich cream, well beaten to free from lumps is best 
for coffee, but boiling fre«h milk is a good substitute. The 
white of an egg thoroughly beaten and added to thin 
cream or rich milk is also very nice. 



COFFEE, TEA AND CHOCOLATE. 3 

6 Tea and Coffee for Children. 

Tea and coffee dietary for children is as bad in its effects 
as its use is universal. Dr. Fergu<!on found that children 
so fed only grew four pounds per annum between the ages 
of thirteen and sixteen; while those who got milk night 
and morning grew fifteen pounds each year. This needs 
no commentary. The deteriorated physique of tea-and- 
coffee-fed children, as seen in their lessened power to resist 
disease, is notorious among the medical men of factory 
districts. 

7 Tea. 

Tea is made variously as the taste of people require. 
Black, green, Japan, and English breakfast, all require 
different methods. For green or Japan tea, scald the tea- 
pot and allow from one-half to one teaspoonful for each 
person, as the strength of the herb may indicate. Pour 
over this one-half a cup of boiling water, steep in a hot 
place, (but do not let it boil) from two to ten minutes, then 
turn in water at a keen boil, in the proportion of one quart to 
every three persons, and let stand five minutes. 

8 English Breakfast or Oolong. 

Take two teaspoonfuls for three persons, and proceed as 
above, only letting the tea boil for ten minutes. 

An English gentleman, whose tea was quite famous, put 
it to steep in cold water, as soon as the one o'clock dinner 
was over, and left it steeping until supper time, when it 
was brought to a boil. 

Others put it on to steep when the fire is made for sup- 
per, and let it stand until the meal is announced, served 
boiling hot. 



4 COFFEE, TEA AND CHOCOLATE. 

9 Icod Tea. 

To each glass of tea add the juice of half a lemon; fill 
up the glass with pounded ice, and sweeten. 



10 German Chocolate. 

For six persons take four heaping tablespoonfuls of plain 
chocolate; when grated, put with it the yolks of two eggs, 
and water enough to mix well together. Place it in the 
chocolate boiler with one half pint of hot water, and 
four tablesj^oonfuls of sugar, taking care to stir well. 
After scalding five minutes, add one quart of boiling 
milk, and then the whites of the two eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth with two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
stirring all the while. It must be sent to the table as 
goon as possible after the whites of the eggs are put in. 

Mrs. C. S. I. 



11 Chocolate. 

Webbs', Bakers, and Mailard's plain chocolates are the 
best— take four or six heaping tablespoonfuls of grated choco- 
late, four of sugar, and wet with four of boiling water; rub 
tbis smooth. Then stir this mixture into one pint of boil- 
ing water; let boil five minutes then add one pint of boil- 
ing milk. Let all boil three minutes. It is greatly im- 
proved, by milling, while boiling, with a dover egg-beater. 
If not desired sweet, omit the sugar. 

A dainty addition is two tablespoonfuls of whipped 
cream, that has been sweetened and flavored with vanilla, 
laid on the top of each cup. 



GENERAL HINTS FOB MAKING SOUPS. 



GENERAL HINTS FORMAKING SOUPS. 



It is not easy to see why soups are held in so little favor 
by Americans generally, while with almost all other 
people they form an impoi'tant article of food. 

The French, from the richest to the poorest, have their 
''pot an feu,''^ which literally would be "pot to the fire," 
but it is the name used to designate the universal soup. 
The directions for this vary. We give one of the most 
economical. Put in a pot, which is kept for this purpose 
alone, four-and-a-half quarts of cold water, and three 
pounds of rump beef, with what remains of poultry or 
cooked meat that may be at hand. Put upon the fire 
until it boils, and then place where it will simmer gently, 
removing the scum as it rises; add carrots, two turnips, 
two leeks or small onions, a head of celery, and three or 
four cloves. 

The whole story is meat and vegetables simmered slowly 
together, and it may be varied in many ways by using dif- 
ferent vegetables. The meat and vegetables are removed 
and the clear soup served, after Avhich the meat and vege- 
tables are served plain, or the meat is dressed with tomato 
or other sauce. Sometimes a tough fowl is put into the 
soup pot and cooked until tender, and then put into the 
oven and browned; the broth thus made serves for a vari- 
ety of soups; with vermicelli, macaroni, rice, or barley, 
and soups take those names. By using a variety of vege- 
tables cut fine it makes vegetable soup. Roast an onion 
until it is thoroughly brown and boil in the broth and you 
have brown soup. 



6 SOUPS. 

A soup may be varied in many ways, sometimes by slic- 
ing liard boiled eggs into it, after dishing; again, small 
squares of bread, fried to a brown crisp, as in receipt for 
croutons, and dropped into the soup when it is ready for 
the table, imparts a savory relish. 

12 Why Soup is Wholesome. 

The Tuondon M>od (/ou7Vial aa,ys: Physiologically, soup 
has great value to those who hurry to and from their 
meals, as it allows an interval of comparative rest to the 
fainting stomach before the more substantial beef and 
mutton is attacked, rest before solid food being as import- 
ant as rest after it. Let a hungry and weary merchant 
rush in medias res — plunge boldly into roast beef, and 
what is the result ? The defeat is often as precipitate as 
was the attack. When the body is weary the stomach 
must be identified with it, and cannot therefore stand the 
shock of some ill-iaasticated, half-pound weight of beef. 
But if a small plateful of light soup be gently insinuated 
into the system, nourishment will soon be introduced, and 
strength will follow to receive more substantial material, 

13 Perfect Mock Turtle Soup. 

Endeavor to have the head and the stock-meat ready 
for the soup, the day before it is to be eaten. It will take 
eight hours to prepare it properly.

SOUPS. 7 

Get a calf's bead with the skin on (the fresher the bet- 
ter) ; take out the brains, wash the head several times in 
cold water, let it soak for about an hour in spring water, 
then lay it in a stewpan, and cover it with cold water, and 
half a gallon over; as it becomes warm, a great deal of 
scum will rise, wliich must be immediately removed; let it 
boil gently for one hour, take it up, and, when almost cold, 
cut the head into pieces about an inch and a half by an 
inch and a quarter, and the tongue into mouthfuls, or 
rather make a side dish of the tongue and brains. 

When the head is taken out, put in the stock meat (about 
five pounds of knuckle of veal), and as much beef ; add to 
the stock all the trimmings and bones of the head, skim it 
well, and then cover it close and let it scald five hours 
(reserve a couple of quarts of this to make gravy sauces) ; 
then strain it off and let it stand till the next morning; 
then take off the fat, set a large stewpan on the fire with 
half a pound of good fresh butter, two ounces of onions 
sliced, and one-fourth ounce of green sage; chop it a lit- 
tle ; let these fry one hour; then rub in half a pound of 
browned flour, and by degrees add your broth till it is the 
thickness of cream; season it with a quarter of an ounce 
of ground allspice and half an ounce of black pepper 
ground very fine, salt to your taste, and the rind of one 
lemon peeled very thin ; let it simmer very gently for one 
hour and-a-hair, then strain it through a hair sieve ; do not 
rub your soup to get it through the sieve, or it will make it 
grouty; if it does not run through easily, knock your wooden 
spoon against the side of your sieve; put it in a clean stew- 
pan with the head, and season it by adding to each gallon of 
soup two tablespoonfuls of Tarragon vinegar and two table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice; let it simmer gently till the meat is 
tender ; this may take from half an hour to an hour ; take 



8 SOUPS. 

care it is not overdone; stir it frequently to prevent the meat 
sticking to the bottom of the stewpan, and when the meat 
is quite tender the soup is ready. 

A head weighing twenty pounds, and ten pounds of 
stock meat, will make ten quarts of excellent soup, besides 
the two quarts of stock you will have put by for made 
dishes. 

Ohs. — If there is more meat on the head than you wish 
to put in the soup, prepare it for a pie, and, with the addi- 
tion of a calf's foot boiled tender, it will make an excel- 
lent ragout pie; season it with zest and a little minced 
onion; put in half a teacupful of stock, cover it with puff- 
paste and bake it one hour; when the soup comes from, 
table, if there is a great deal of meat and no soup, put it 
into a pie dish, season it a little, and add some little stock 
to it; then cover it with paste, bake it one hour, and you 
have a good mock-turtle pie. 

To Season the Soup. — To each gallon put four table- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice, two of mushroom catsup, and 
one teaspoonful of mace, a tablespoonful of curry powder, 
or a quarter of a drachm of cayenne, and the peel of a 
lemon pared as thin as possible, let it simmer for five min- 
utes more, take out the lemon peel, add the yolks of four 
hard boiled eggs, and the soup is ready for the tureen. 

While the soup is doing, prepare for each tureen a dozen 
and a half of mock turtle forcemeat balls, and put them into 
the tureen. Brain balls, or cakes, are a very elegant addi- 
tion, and are made by boiling the brains for ten minutes, 
then putting them in cold water and cutting them into 
pieces about as big as a large nutmeg; take savory or 
lemon thyme dried and finely powdered, uutmeg grated, 
pepper and salt, and pound them all together; beat up an 
egg, dip the brains in it, and then roll them in this mix- 



sours. 9 

ture, and make as much of it as possible stick to them; dip 
them in the eggs again, and then in finely-grated and sifted 
bread-crumbs; fry them in hot fat, and send them up as a 
side dish. 

A well blanched veal sweet-bread, not too much done or 
it will break, cut into pieces the same size as you cut the 
calf's head, and put in the soup, just to get warm before 
it goes to table, is a superb '■'■bonne bouchej''^ and pickled 
tongue, stewed till very tender, and cut into mouthfuls, is 
a favorite addition. We order the meat to be cut into 
mouthfuls, that it may be eaten with a spoon; the knife 
and fork have no business in a soup-plate, 

N. B. — In helping this soup, the distributer of it should 
serve out the meat, force-meat and gravy, in equal parts; 
however trifling or needless this remark may appear, the 
writer has often suffered from the want of such a hint 
being given to the soup-server, who has sometimes sent a 
plate of mere gravy without meat, to others, of meat 
without gravy, and sometimes scarcely anything but force- 
meat balls. 

Obs. — This is a delicious soup, within the reach of those 
who " eat to live; " but if it had been composed expressly 
for those who only " live to eat," I do not know how it 
could have been made more agreeable; as it is, the lover 
of good eating will "wish his throat a mile long, and every 
inch of it a palate." 

14 Bouillon. 

To five pounds beef cut in small pieces add five quarts 
cold water; simmer slowly six hours. A shank of beef, 
broken twice across and once lengthwise is equally good. 
After boiling three hours slowly, add salt, black pepper,. 



10 sours. 

one tablespoonful allspice, two onions cut small, one grated 
carrot, one head celery, two tomatoes, one dozen whole 
cloves, boil slowly three hours longei', sti'ain and set away. 
Next day remove the fat, and boil; just before serving, 
adding a little nutmeg and mace. In summer, if one 
dozen ochras are boiled in the soup, it will require but 
little spice. Made entirely of lean meat, it can be used 
the same day. Serve in bouillon cups, 

15 Corn Soup. 

Cut the grains from twelve ears of sweet corn and scrape 
the milk, add one quart of water; let it boil until quite 
done, thirty or forty minutes, then add two quarts of new 
milk, and when it boils stir in one quarter of a pound of 
butter rubbed into two tablespoonfuls of flour; pepper and 
salt to taste. Beat the yolks of two eggs with two table- 
spoonfuls of cream, place in the bottom of the tureen and 
pour the soup into it boiling; stir all the time for a minute 
and a half. 



16 Summer or Winter Corn Soup. 

Boil a leg of mutton or shank of beef in six quarts of 
water for four hours, (or less, if the mutton is to be eaten 
"for dinner). After the meat and fat have been removed 
(it is better to stand over one day to cool, so that the grease 
may all be taken off), add a quart or more of sweet corn 
nicely cut from the cob, and boil twenty or thirty minutes. 
In cutting the corn (with a sharp knife) take off only the 
point of the kernels, and scrape the milk and pulp, thus 
avoiding the hull or skin, which is indigestible and unpal- 
atable. Just before serving, add to the soup a coffee-cup of 



SOUPS. 11 

oream, with two tablespoonfuls of flour stirred smoothly in 
and boil for a minute. This can be made in winter by 
using the Y'armouth canned corn or the dried corn soaked 
over night, and boiled till tender. The corn flavors mut- 
ton better than beef stock. 

1 7 Corn Soup. 

One pint grated corn, one quart milk, two tablespoons 
butter, one slice of onion, salt and pepper to taste. Cook 
the corn in two quarts of water thirty minutes. Let the 
milk and onion come to a boil. Have the flour and butter 
mixed, and a little boiling milk, and cook eight minutes, 
then take out the onion and add the corn. 

Fisher's Island, 1882. 

18 Potato Soup. ■" 

Ten large potatoes boiled soft; pour off the water and 
mash. Add one quarter of a pound of butter and pour on 
three pints of cold milk; let it come to a boil, stirring to 
prevent burning. Season with pepper and salt; put some 
toasted crackers or bread fried in butter into the tureen, 
and strain the soup on them through a colander, serve hot. 

19 Parker House Tomato Soup. 

For one gallon of soup take three quarts of good beef 
stock (a shank of beef will make six quarts); one medium 
sized carrot, one turnij), one beet and two small onions; 
peel and cut them in pieces; add to this three quarts of 
red tomatoes; boil all for one hour and strain through a 
colander. Put five ounces of butter in a pan, heat it until 
it becomes a light brown ; take it off the fire and add three 



12 SOUPS. 

tablespoonfuls of flour while hot; mix well and pour a pint 
or more of the soup into the frying pan, then return all to 
the soup kettle; season with salt, pepper, and a dessert 
spoonful of sugar. Set it over the fire and stir it till it 
boils; boil and skim five minutes. For winter soup of this 
kind strain the soup before adding the tomatoes, and use 
in place of the raw tomatoes, two quart cans of sealed 
tomatoes. 



20 Very Rich Beef Soup. 

Fry an onion in the bottom of your soup digester, then 
place four pounds of meat upon it and let it heat until the 
juices of the meat start well. Then add one onion, one 
turnip, one carrot, sliced quite thin, two or three stalks of 
celery, some parsley, a blade of mace; four whole cloves, 
salt and peppei', a tomato, if in season, a tablespoon of 
caramel or burnt sugar. Boil slowly and gently, keeping 
it covered until the vegetables are tender, then strain, and 
it is ready for use. 



21 Turkey Toup. 

Place the rack of a cold turkey and what remains of 
dressing or gravy in a pot, and cover it with cold watei'. 
Simmer gently three or four hours, and let it stand until 
the next day. Take off what fat may have arisen, and 
take out with a skimmer all the bits of bones. Put the 
soup on to heat till boiling, then thicken slightly with 
flour stirred into a cup of cream, and season to the taste. 
Pick off all the turkey from the bones, put them in the 
soup, boil up and serve.

This is a most wholesome soup, which would be popular 
in America if it were better known. It is much used in 
France. Sorrel can be obtained in season, at all the French 
mai-kets in America. 

For four quarts of soup, put into a saucepan a piece of 
butter the size of an egg, two or three sprigs of parsley, 
two or three leaves of lettuce, one onion aud a pint of sor- 
rel (all finely chopped), a little nutmeg, pepper and salt. 
Cover, and let them cook or sweat ten minutes, then add 
two tablespoonfuls of flour; mix well, and gradually add 
three quarts of boiling water (stock would be better). 
Make a liaison, i. e., beat the yolks of four eggs (one egg 
to a quart of soup), and mix with them a cupful of cream, 
or rich milk; add a little chevril (if you have it) to the 
soup; let it boil ten minutes; then stir in the eggs or liai- 
son, when the soup is quite ready. 

2S Calf's Head Soup (Simple Process). 

Take the head, pluck and feet. Put them into a pot 
with cold water. Be careful to skim well when it boils. 
Chop a dozen small onions and let them all boil together 
until the meat cleaves from the bones. Then strain it. 
After putting the liquor into the pot again, add thyme, 
cloves, salt, pepper and cayenne to your taste. Cut all the 
meat from the head and feet, half the liver and lights, the 
whole of the heart and tongue; put all into the pot and 
boil about three-quai'ters of an hour. Before it is done 
take half a pound of butter with as much flour as will make 
into balls; stir until dissolved. Then add two tablespoon- 
fuls of tarragon vinegar, four hard boiled eggs cut in slices, 
and a lemon to improve the flavor. This will make two 
gallons, and maj' be kept several weeks, to be used as 
occasion requires.

24 Ockra Soup. 

Take two quarts of good strong stock; chop a carroty 
two onions, and a very small turnip; let these fry well in 
two tablespoonfuls of butter; take out the vegetables and 
in the butter left in the pan, slightly brown two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, add to this a little stock to get it very 
smooth, then pour the vegetables and browned flour into 
the stock. Wash and cut one dozen ockras in wafers an 
eighth of an inch thick and let them simmer with the stock 
and vegetables from one and-a-half to two hours. Add 
pepper and salt and serve with sippets of toast. 



25 Tomato Sonp. 

One quart of water, eight good sized ripe tomatoes cut 
up; boil twenty minutes and add one half teaspoonful of 
soda; then boil and add one pint or more of milk, and 
season as you do oysters. We have three friends who 
think this soup is delicious, and six who pronounce it abom- 
inable. 



26 Veal Soup. 

Take a veal shank and boil it eight hours in three quarts 
of water; set the liquor in a cool place until an hour before 
dinner; skim it well and dry off the top with tissue or 
blotting paper. It should be a jelly. Let it scald for half 
an hour with an onion unbroken or cut at the bottom of the 
pot; then add a pint of cream into which two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour have been well stirred; season with salt and 
pepper, and a little chopped parsley, or as in sorrel soup. 



SOUPS. 15 

27 Black Bean Soup. 

One quart of black beans, soaked over night, and boiled 
until perfectly soft; mash them through a colander; have 
ready three quarts of strong beef stock; add to it the 
beans and one small onion; boil one hour. Have in the 
soup tureen three hard-boiled eggs, minced fine ; slice in 
one lemon; one teaspoonful of brown sugar, a pinch of 
cloves, two of cinnamon, black pepper and salt; also two 
tablespoonfuls of the mace compound. Pour the soup into 
the tureen and serve at once. 

Mrs. a. S.'s "Lizzie." 

28 Pea Soup. 

One quart of soaked split peas, two pounds of salt pork, 
five quarts of water. Boil five hours, and strain through 
a sieve while hot. 

29 Croutons. 

These are small pieces of bread, ciit the size of a dice, 
and fried crisp and brown, to be used in soup. 

30 Browning for Soups. 

Many of the nicest soups owe their attractive appearance 
to burnt sugar, which is prepared as follows: Put three 
tablespoonfuls of brown sugar and an ounce of butter in a 
small frying pan or iron skillet and set over the fire; stir 
continually until it is of a bright brown color and sends 
forth a burning smell, add half a pint of water, boil and 
skim, and when cold, bottle for use. Add to soups at dis- 
cretion. 



16 SOUPS. 

31 Oyster Soup. 

This is one of the finest soups we have ever tasted. To 
one quart of oysters add a teacup of water, shake well and 
strain off ; putting the oysters in a double boiler to heat, 
then take the strained liquor set it over the fire and as soon 
as it becomes scalding hot pour it over a piece of butter 
the size of an egg, into which you have braided, while the 
liquor is boiling, a tablespoonful of flour; let butter, flour 
and liquor cook a few minutes, stirring well, then add half 
a pint of sweet milk or cream and then the oysters, season- 
ing with salt and a little cayanne pepper. Do not let the 
soup boil, but keep it quite hot for a moment or two after 
adding the oysters. Have both soup and oysters cooking 
so equally that neither waits for the other. This is the 
secret of success. 

32 Oyster Soup. 

For four cans of oysters have twelve crackers rolled 
■fine, two quarts of boiling water, one pint of good rich 
milk. Let the milk and water come to a boil, add the 
crackers, salt and pepper, boil one minute briskly; pour in 
the oysters, which have been heating in the double boiler, 
and let all come to a scald; add about a quarter of a pound 
of butter as they are poured into a tureen. 

33 Miss Parloa's &reen Pea Soup. 

One pint of the peas having already been thoroughly 
cooked, are put in a pot on the stove with a slice of onion 
added. When they have been brought to a boil they are 
removed and mashed, and a pint of stock is added. Then 
two tablespoonfuls of butter are melted, and a tablespoon- 
ful of flour is mixed in the stewpan. This is poured into 
the mixture of peas and stock and a pint of cream added last.

34 Soup Dumplings— Mrs. Swing. 

Three tablespoonfuls of Hour, white of one egg, aiici one 
tablespoonful of marrow out of the beef boue minced 
with a fork. In seasoning, salt, pepper, a little lemon 
peel, and a little minced parsley were used. This dump- 
ling was said to look lovely in amber soup. The materials 
have to be pounded together with the white of egg until 
well blended, then form into little balls the size of marbles. 

"Does the suet moisten the dumpling?" inquired a 
pupil in the body of the hall. 

" The white of egg moisiens," replied Mrs. Ewing. 

A soup bone should be at least half meat if rich broth 
was desired. Place in a stock pot or digester, differ- 
ing from the ordinary kettle in tiiat it had a close fitting 
lid. Cover with cold water, add a teaspoonful of salt. 
The meat and bone takes about two quarts of water. The 
water to be put on cold and salt added at the time, in order 
to draw out the slime and blood, and assist in its rising in 
the scum so that it might be carefully skimmed off. When 
the water comes to the boil it must be carefully skimmed. 
If allowed to boil in, the soup would not be so clear nor 
half so finely flavored. The most important point in 
regard to flavor is that the soup made shall be fresh and 
not salt. When the soup has been properly skimmed the 
cover should be put on and screwed down close and the 
soup be allowed to simmer,not to boil rapidly, for four hours. 
Longer cooking simply extracts more of the gelatine that 
is in the bone, while affecting the clearness of the soup. 
All the juices of the meat could be perfectly extracted in 
four hours. A tine strainer or fine hair sieve was the best 
for straining, but a napkin would answer the purpuse. 



18 SOUPS. 

The draining process completed, the soup should be set to 
cool in the coldest obtainable place — not a refrigerator — 
but in a draught of cold air, for the sooner the soup stock 
cools the more perfect the flavor and the longer it keeps. 
A knife run along the bowl removes every particle of 
grease. . 

Amber colored stock can be made with a pound of the 
lean beef that comes from the round, such as is used for 
beef tea, cooked in a skillet, or cast-iron spider. Round 
lean beef gives the soup stock its beautiful amber color 
and fine flavor. Another way is,to take the soup bones and 
spread a little butter over the lean meat; then place in a 
bake pan and put in the oven and brown nicely before being 
put in the stock pot. To every quart of simple stock 
apply a pound of beefsteak browned on a hot pan, clari- 
fying with shell and white of egg. One vegetable added 
to a plain soup or clear soap changes it immediately to a 
veo-etable soup, and no multiplication of vegetables would 
make it anything other than this. In vegetable soup the 
main thing is to get the vegetables mixed in proper pi'o- 
portion to combine things that harmonize or taste well 
together. The maximum of success was attained when no 
one of the various ingredients could be tasted distinctly. 

35 Green Pea Soup. 

Take a small slice of salt pork, a quart of fresh shelled 
oreen peas, or, if in winter, a can of French or Marrowfat 
peas, pour over them a quart of boiling water and let them 
boil until they can be washed and strained through a seive 
or fine colander. Then pour in three pints of boiling 
milk; salt and pepper to taste. Let all scald together for 
ten minutes; have the yolks of two eggs beaten with two 



SOUP. 1 9 

tablespoonfuls of milk in youi" soup tureen, pour the scald- 
ing soup upon tbem, and add a spoonful of fresh butter. 
Serve with croutons, or toasted bread, or crackers. 

36 White Almond Soup. 

A shank of veal put into five quarts of cold water and 
boiled down to four; put one carrot, one bunch of celery, 
one good sized onion, and two cloves into a bag, and put 
them into the soup kettle with the veal and boil half an 
hour, or until the flavor is exti'acted. Then take them out. 
When the liquor is boiled down to four quarts set it aside 
until the next day. When you wish to serve, put the 
jelly in the soup kettle and add two ounces of blanched 
almonds chopped fine, and half a pint of sweet cream, cook 
a few moments, and send to the table. 

37 Clam Soup. 

Put thirty clams in a pot, add four quarts of water. Let 
them scald two hours and then take them out and chop 
fine, return to the pot and add a little mace and a few 
pepper corns. Boil one hour longer. Rub smoothly 
together a piece of butter, the size of an egg, with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir this with a pint of boiling 
milk. Into the clam soup, which has now boiled three 
hours, stir in the thickened milk and pour into tureen. 

Canned clams make a nice soup after the above recipe. 



20 OYSTERS. 



OYSTERS. 

(JFhr Oyster Soups, see Sotips. 



38 To Stew Oysters. 

Put the oysters with the broth to boil, and when they 
begin to curl, skim them out of the kettle into a pan of 
cold water; let them lie in the water until the broth has 
been skinimed and seasoned with butter, salt and pepper; 
add mace if you like; then drain off the Avater and return 
the oysters to the broth. When they beg^in to boil up 
again they are ready to serve, and will be found to be 
more plump and hard by the process. 

39 Panned or Griddled Oysters. 

Wash large oysters free from the liquor. Heat a griddle 
very hot, butter it and lay large oysters all over it ; when 
brown on one side, turn as you do griddle cakes. In the 
meantime have the liquor boiled and skimmed, and turned 
over the oysters when served, first seasoning it with butter, 
salt and pepper; serve on toasted bj*ead. 

-1:0 Devilled Oysters. 

To one quart of chopped oysters, add six tablespoonfuls 
of rolled cracker, four tablespoonfuls of meltod butter, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of 
pepper; bake in hot oyster shells fifteen or twenty minutes. 



OYSTEKS. 21 

41 Roasted Oysters. 

One quart of oysters, rounds of thin toast delicately 
browned, butter, pepper and salt. Have ready silver or 
scalop shells, or several pans of block tin, the ordinary 
" patty pan " will do if you cannot get anything better. 
Cut stale bread in thin slices of a size that will just fit in 
the bottom of your pans, toast these quickly to a light 
brown, and laj'' within your tins. Wet with a great spoon- 
ful of oyster liquor, then with a silver fork arrange upon 
the toast as many oysters as each patty will hold without 
heaping thera up. Dust with pepper and salt, put a bit of 
butter on top, and set the pans, when they are full, upon 
the floor of a quick oven. Cover with an inverted baking 
pan to keep in steam and flavor, and cook until the oysters 
"ruffle." Eight minutes in a brisk oven should be enougli; 
send very hot to the table in the tins in which they were 
roasted. Next to roasting in the shell this mode of cooking- 
oysters best preserves the native flavor of the bivalves. 

42 How to Broil Oysters. 

Now let me tell you how we broil oysters here. Given 
a double gridiron that folds together, and a sufticient num- 
ber of the bivalves in their natural state, to roll them in 
anything is to spoil them; grease the bars of the gridiron, 
which prevents their sticking; then dip each individual — 
as Audubon always said in reference to birds — into melted 
butter; place them on the utensil. A brisk fire of charcoal 
is of course necessary, over which they are to be broiled. 
Meantime they should be constantly turned and basted 
with butter. When done, serve on very hot toast and 
dishes, and you have a dish that Brillat-Savarin, with all 
his gastronomic ideas, never thought of, and which would 
have driven him mad with envy. 



22 OYSTERS. 

43 Fried Oysters. 

Select the largest, drain them on a cloth or hair sieve, 
dip them in rolled cracker crumbs that have been sifted 
and seasoned with pepper and salt ; fry in equal parts of 
butter and lard until they are browned. Grated bread 
crumbs are even more delicate than cracker crumbs, and 
do not require sifting, 

44 Pried Oysters. 

Dry large oysters on a soft towel, dip them into well 
beaten egg and roll in sifted cracker crumbs; then fry in 
equal parts of butter and lard, which should be very hot. 

45 Fried Oysters. 

Beat an egg and a tablespoonf ul of milk together, add 
to this enough finely sifted cracker crumbs to make a thin 
batter, dry the oysters, dip them into this batter and draw 
them out well covered with it, plunge them into boiling 
batter and lard and fry. 

46 Oyster Fritters.— Madame Pierson. 

Take the liquor from the oysters, boil and skim it, add 
to every teacupful an equal quantity of milk, three eggs 
and six tablespoonfuls of flour, into which has been stirred 
a teaspoonfu! of baking |)owder; pour a tablespoonful of 
butter in a small cake on the griddle, lay an oyster in the 
middle and let it cook through. 

47 Oysters Broiled in the Shell. 

The oysters should be of the largest size. Clean the 
shells with a stiff brush, then open, and save the juice ; 



OYSTERS. 23 

turn boiling water over the oysters for only a minute or 
two ; drain it off, and lay the oysters on one-half of the 
shell, putting it on a well-heated gridiron over a very hot 
fire. Boil the liquor that came from the oysters when 
opened, add it to the shells with a sprinkle of salt, pepper, 
and a bit of butter; serve hot on the shells, laid on large 
platters. 

48 Teal's Cream Oysters. 

Fifty large oysters, one quart sweet cream, butter, pep- 
per, and salt to taste; put the cream and oysters in sepa- 
rate kettles to heat, the oysters in their own liquor and let 
them come to a boil; when sufficiently cooked skim them, 
take out the oysters and put in a bowl to keep warm, put 
the cream and oyster liquor together, season to taste and 
thicken with powdered crackers, when thick as cream add 
the oysters. 

49 Unsurpassed Fricasseed Oysters. 

For one can of oysters use one pint of thin creart; ; clean 
all the liquor from the oysters and put them in the double 
boiler until hot; at the same time thicken the cream with 
two even tablespoonfuls flour and season with salt, pepper 
and a small pinch of mace, and the same of cinnamon and 
a very little butter; cook this well, and when done thor- 
oughly, add to it the liquor of the oysters which has been 
scalded and well skimmed until clear; then add the oysters, 
letting them remain just long enough to get plump (if left 
too long they shrivel and grow tough). Have ready some 
toast cut in two inch squares on a platter and pour the 
whole over it, or have leaves and triangles of ricli paste

around the dish and partially moistened by the fricassee. 
Your platter must be very hot, as fricasseed oysters chill 
like a new-born baby. 

50 Fricasseed Oysters. 

Drain the liquor from a quart of oysters, which should 
be placed to heat in the double boiler, strain half a pint of 
the liquor and put in a porcelain kettle and when it boils 
put in the oysters, have ready two tablespoonfuls of flour 
rubbed into a tablespoonfuls of butter. When the oysters 
begin to swell, stir this into the sauce, cook until the oysters 
are- white and plump; then add a gill of cream, and pepper 
and salt. 

51 Oyster Pie.— Mrs. S. P. B. 

• Two cans of oysters, or three pints of solid oysters, one 
quart of sweet cream, one dozen rolled butter crackers, 
l)epper, salt, etc. Stir all together and pour into a dish 
lined with thick puff paste, cover with another paste and 
bake three-quarters of an hour. This is a delicious mode 
of cooking oysters. 

52 Oyster Patties. 

Put the oysters in a saucepan with enough of the liquor 
to cover them; let them come to a scald, skim well, add 
two tablespoonfuls of butter for one quart of oysters, sea- 
son with pepper and a little salt. Two or three spoonfuls 
of cream will add to the richness. Have ready small tins 
lined with puff-paste; put three or four oysters in each, 
according to the size of the patty ; cover with paste and 
bake in a quick oven twenty minutes; when done wash 
over the top with beaten egg and set in the oven for two 
minutes to glaze. 



OYSTERS. 25 

53 Scalloped Oysters. 

Have a pint of grated bread crumbs or fine crushed 
cracker crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper, either soda 
or butter crackers; put a thin layer in the bottom of a but- 
tei'ed two-quart pudding dish ; wet slightly with oyster 
liquor and milk, mixed ; next a thick layer of oysters; sea- 
son with salt and pepper and small bits of butter; then 
more crumbs and oysters, alternately, until the dish is full. 
Let the top layer be of crumbs. Beat an egg and mix it 
with a little milk to pour over the top; place little lumps 
of butter all over the top, cover the dish and bake half an 
hour; remove the cover a few minutes before taking from 
the oven to let it brown. The oysters must be done through 
but not overdone. 

54 Oyster Omelette. 

Beat six eggs separately; add, by degrees, one gill of 
cream to the beaten yolks; season with salt and pepper, 
add the whites, well beaten. Have ready one dozen large 
oysters cut in half; put into a saucepan to heat, one table- 
spoonful of butter; pour the eggs into it, drop the oysters 
on evenly. Fry a light brown, then set in the oven to 
brown the top, or turn like an ordinary omelette. 

55 Croustade of Oysters. 

Have a loaf of bread baked in a round two-quart basin. 
When two or three days old, with a sharp knife cut out 
the heart of the bread, being careful not to break the crust, 
and plunge it into a deep pot of boiling lard for one 
moment, or butter the entire surface of the bread, and 
bake in a hot oven, being careful not to burn. Break 
up the crumbs very fine, and dry them slowly in an 



^6 OYSTERS. 

oven; then quickly fry three cupfuls of them in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. As soon as they begin to look golden 
and are cri8p,they are done. It takes about two minutes over 
a hot fire, stirring all the time. Put one quart of cream 
to boil, and when it boils, stir in three tablespoonfuls of 
flour which has been mixed with half a cupful of cold 
milk. Cook eight minutes. Season well with salt and 
pepper. Put a layer of the sauce into the croustade, then 
a layer of oysters, which dredge well with salt and pepper; 
then another layer of sauce and one of fried crumbs. 
Continue this until the croustade is nearly full, having the 
last layer a thick one of crumbs. It lakes three pints of 
oysters for this dish, and about three teaspoonfuls of salt, 
and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Bake slowly half an 
hour. Serve with a garnish of parsley around the dish. 

56 Chicken and Oyster Croquettes. 

Take equal quantities of chicken and oysters; over the 
latter pour scalding water; parboil for a moment, and then 
plump in cold water; chop both chicken and oysters fine; 
add a cup of sifted bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, stirred well together, then moisten with one well beaten 
egg and enough thick sweet cream to make just thick 
enough to handle; season with salt and pepper, and if 
liked, a little mace; form into long, slender rolls; dip into 
beaten egg, roll in sifted cracked crumbs, and fry in lard 
to a light brown; serve in a napkin, and garnish with celery 
tops or parsley and slices of lemon. 

^7 Pickled Oysters. 

Strain the liquor from the oysters; boil and skim until 
■clear; drop in the oysters and let them come to a boil; 



OYSTERS. 27 

skim them out and put them in a jar. Take about half the 
liquor remaining, add vinegar until it tastes sharp, a few 
whole cloves and allspice; boil and pour over the oysters, 
hot; cover them and let them stand two or thi*ee days 
before using. If you wish to use them any sooner take a 
little more vinegar. 

58 Pickled Oysters, No. 2. 

Take the oysters from the liquor, boil and skim it. Rinse 
the oysters if there are any bits of shell attached to them; 
put them in the liquor while boiling; boil them one minute, 
then take them out of it, and to the liquor put a few pepper 
corns and a blade or two of mace, and a little salt, and the 
same quantity of vinegar as oyster juice. Let the whole 
Bcald fifteen minutes, then turn it On to the oysters. If 
you wish to keep the oysters a couple of weeks, bottle and 
cork them tight as soon as cold. 

59 Lobster Croquettes, 

Chop the meat of a well-boiled lobster fine, add pepper, 
salt and mace, if liked; mix with this one-fourth as much 
bread crumbs as you have meat; with two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter and yolks of two eggs, form into balls, roll 
these in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in hot 
lard. 

60 Oyster and Clam Fritters. 

Twelve clams, minced fine, one pint milk, three eggs; 
add the liquor from the clams to the milk; beat up the 
eggs and put to this, with salt and pepper, and tiour 
enough for a thin batter; lastly add the chopped clams. 



28 OYSTERS. 

Fry in hot lard, trying a little first to see if fat and batter 
are right. A tablespoonful makes a fritter of moderate 
size. Fry quickly and serve hot. 

61 Batter for Oyster Fritters. 

One egg, one tablespoonful of flour and half a cup of 
milk; pour scalding water over the oysters in a quart can; 
then chop them and add to the batter. 

62 Raw Oysters. 

Should be served at a party or small entertainment on a 
handsome block of ice, that has been hollowed out on the top. 
Set the ice on a platter and garnish the edges with quar- 
ters of lemons. Be careful that in its melting the water 
does not overflow. For a second course at dinners or 
lunches lay three or four oysters on an individual oyster 
dish, garnished with lemon; lay a sprig of the yellow heart 
of celery across. Have pepper, salt and vinegar at hand. 



FISH AND FR0C4S. 29 



FISH AND FROGS. 



63 Boiled Pish. 

Rub the fish with a fresh lemon, inside and out. To 
four quarts of boiling water add half a teacupful of salt, 
a bouquet of sweet herbs, and half a teacupful of vinegar; 
boil gently, or scald, as the size of the fish may require, 
allowing from six to ten minutes for each pound of fish. 
Sei've on a napkin, with egg sauce or drawn butter, and 
gravy-boat garnished with cut lemons and hard boiled 
eggs grated over. 



<>4 Boiled Pish with Vegetable Flavor. 

Mince a carrot, an onion, and a small piece of celery; fry 
them in a stewpan with a little butter; add some parsley, 
some pepper-corn, and three or four cloves. Now pour on 
two quarts of water and a pint of vinegar; let it boil a 
quarter of an hour, skim it, salt it,and use for boiling the fish. 
Rub the fish with lemon juice and salt, put it in a kettle 
and cover with the above liquor. Let it only simmer — not 
boil hard — until tlioroughly done. 

65 To Broil a Whitefish. 

Lay the fish wide open upon a double gridiron, and broil 
it as you would a steak; salt and pepper. 



30 FISH AND FROGS. 

66 Pish Chowder. 

Quarter pound of pork, cut in pieces; put in the bottom 
of the pot and fry out. Put slices of potatoes on this, then 
layer of fiah, cut up, two onions, sliced, and layer of soda 
crackers; repeat these layers. Then pour boiling water 
over till well covered. Stew twenty-five minutes, but do 
not stir it. This is excellent, made of whitefish as well as 
cod. 



67 Tnrbot, No. 1. 

Take a fine large white fish, steam until tender; take out 
the bones and sprinkle with pepper and salt. For the 
dressing heat one quart of milk and thicken with one- 
quarter pound of flour stirred smooth in a cup of milk. 
When cool add two eggs and one-quarter pound of butter. 
Put in the baking-dish a layer of fish, then a layer of 
sauce, until full. Season with onions, parsley and thyme. 
Cover the top with bread crumbs and bake three-quarters 
of an hour. 



68 Turbot, No. 2. 

Five poimds of white fish, boil and cool. For dressing 
take one quart of milk, one quarter-pound of flour, wet 
with a little milk, one-quarter pound of butter, two eggs, 
two small onions, one-half bunch of thyme, one-half bunch 
of green parsley, pepper and salt. Boil together until it 
thickens. Put in the baking dish a layer of fish, then a 
layer of dressing, a layer of bread crumbs. Grate cheese 
over the top, and bake half an hour.

69 Cod Fish Balls. 

Pick carefully and take out all bones, and skin enough 
to fill level full a pint bowl. Lay this in the bottom of 
your kettle, and place on top two heaping bowls of raw- 
potatoes freshly peeled; pour over boiling water enough to 
cover both fish and potatoes; boil thirty minutes, then 
mash both together until very fine and smooth; break into 
this mixture two raw eggs, stir with a wooden spoon or 
pot-stick until all are light and well blended; add a bit of 
butter the size of an egg, then flour your hands and make 
up into croquets or flat cakes, as you prefer, and boil in a 
frying-pan. We prefer croquets but old time folks like 
genuine fish balls. The secret of success is mixing fish and 
potatoes while both are hot. 

70 Baked Lobster,- or Lobster Turbot, 

Two tablespoonfuls of flour (even), mixed well with one 
tablespoonful of butter. Put over the fire one teacupful 
of milk. When it comes to the boiling point, stir in the 
flour and butter; add yofks of three hai'd-boiled eggs, salt 
and one teaspoonful of curry powder or anchovy sauce, 
and red pepper. This makes the sauce. Put in a baking 
dish a layer of lobster, and then one of sauce; bake thirty 
or forty minutes and serve piping hot.

71 Pickled Fish. 

Skin the fish and pack in a deep dish; cover with olive 
oil or butter; spice vinegar with pepper, cloves, cinnamon, 
allspice and salt; scald and pour over the fish; cover closely 
and bake until done.

72 Picked Codfish (Delicious). 

Pick, very fine indeed, of the thick part of the codfish 
one pound, put it into the spider, pour over sufficient boil- 
ing water to cover it well, then scald it well for a minute; 
pour off all this water, and if the fish is still too salty drain 
it off and repeat the process. Get ready a cup and a half 
of sweet (fresh) milk. Take from this amount of milk 
four tablespoonfuls and mix into it two tablesjioons of 
sifted flour and stir till it becomes a smooth batter. Pour 
on to the fish the fresh milk and set on the stove. Add to 
it two ounces of butter. Allow it to cook till the butter 
melts, then stir in the prepared batter very slowly and let 
all boil ten minutes, stirring all the time. If too thick add 
a little milk; if too thin, add a little flour. After dishing, 
sprinkle a little pepper over it. Cream can be used without 
the flour. 



73 Codfish for Friday Dinner. 

One quart picked codfish, one pint bread crumbs, one- 
half pint cream, four ounces butter, one teaspoon pepper; 
wash the fish thoroughly and soak over night in cold water. 
When ready to use pick it fine; put it in a baking-dish, in 
layers, with the crumbs and pepper (adding a little mus- 
tard if you like); over the top layer, which must be 
crumbs, spread the softened butter; pour the cream over 
the whole and bake half an hour. Milk may be used 
instead of cream. 



FISH AND FROGS. 33 

74 Frogs. 

Scald them iu salted boiling water, rub them with lemon 
juice and boil for three minutes; wipe them; dip them first 
in cracker dust, then in eggs (half a cupful of milk mixed 
in two eggs and seasoned with pepper and salt), then again 
in cracker crumbs. When they are well covered with 
crumbs, clean off the bone at the end with a dry cloth. 
Put a tablespoonful of lard and a tablespoonful of butter 
in a spider, over a bright fire, and when hot enough j)ut in 
the frogs and fry.

75 Drawn Butter Sauce. 

Ingredients: Three ounces of butter, one ounce of flour, 
half a pint of water (or, what is better, veal stock), a 
pinch of salt and pepper. Put two ounces of the butter 
into a stew pan, and when it bubbles and boils up, sprinkle 
in the flour. Stir it well with a wire egg whisk, until the 
flour is thoroughly cooked and smooth, but without taking 
any color, and then mix in well the water or stock; take 
it off the fire and pour through the gravy strainer; then 
add the one ounce of butter cut in small bits. This sauce 
may be greatly varied and called by a dozen names. 1st. 
By the addition of two tablespoonfuls of nasturtions, or 
pickled cucumber, or cauliflowers, these latter cut fine, or 
by two tablespoonfuls of capers, 2d. For fish, anchovy 
paste or anchovy sauce may be added as desired, from one 
teaspoonf ul to one tablespoonful, or the inside of a lemon 
chopped fine, being careful to remove the seeds. 

76 Drawn Butter Sauce. 

Two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour, a generous half cup 
of butter and one pint of boiling water, work the flour and 
butter together until creamy and light, gradually add the 
boiling water, stir gradually until it comes to a boil, but 
do not let it boil, take from the fire and serve. A speck of 
Cayenne pepper may be added if you choose. 



SAVOKY SAUCES. 35 

77 Egg Sauce. 

Cut up three hard-boiled 9ggs in small dice, salt, pepper, 
minced onions (one teaspoonful), parsley and thyme; add 
all these to the drawn butter recipe. It is very nice for 
boiled chickens, fish or leg of mutton. 



78 Oyster Sauce. 

Scald one pint of large fresh oysters just enough to- 
plump them, adding one tablespoonful of pepper, vinegar, 
a little black pepper and salt; pour this into a recipe of 
well made drawn butter (as above) at boiling point; stir 
thoroughly, and serve. 

79 Celery Sauce. 

Cut enough celery into pieces half an inch long to fill a 
pint bowl, and stew in a small quantity of water (say a 
cupful) till tender; add one teaspoonful of pepper vinegar, 
a little salt and pepper; pour in one teacup of cream or 
milk, and add a teacup of very thick drawn butter. 



80 Tcmato Sauce. 

One quart of canned tomatoes, two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, two of flour, six cloves, a small slice of onion, cook 
the tomatoes ten minutes, heat the butter in a small frying 
pan, add the flour, cloves and onion, stir over the fire until 
smooth and brown, then stir into the tomatoes, cook five 
minutes, season to taste with salt and pepper, rub through 
a strainer fine enough to keep back the seeds; this sauce is 
nice for meat or macaroni. Mrs. A. S.'s "Lizzie." 



36 SAVORY SAUCES. 

81 Tomato Sauce. 

Scald and peel six large, ripe tomatoes; cut them up and 
stew slowly; cream together one tablespoonful of butter, 
one tablespoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of flour; 
when the tomatoes are thoroughly done and reduced to a 
tine pulp, add pepper and salt; stir the butter, sugar and 
flour in; let boil up, and serve. In winter this sauce may 
be made from nice canned tomatoes. 

82 Pepper Vinegar. 

Fill a quart bottle or jar with small peppers, either green 
or ripe; put in two tablespoonfuls of sugar and fill with 
<yood cider vinegar. Invaluable in seasoning sauces, and 
-crood to eat with fisli or meat. 

83 Mint Sauce. 

Of fresh garden mint take enough to make half a tea- 
cupful when chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
half a teacupful of cold vinegar; let them stand from one 
to three hours; when your lamb is ready to serve, add half 
a teacup of boiling water and let scald. 

84- Sauce Hollandaise, 

To make one pint of sauce use one tablespoon of butter 
and one of flour. Mix in a saucepan on the fire until the 
butter melts. Put in gradually, one-half cup at a time, 
stirring smooth each time, one pint of water, hot or cold. 
Season with one salt-spoon of salt, one-fourth as much 
pepper and a little nutmeg. Let the sauce boil a minute 
to take away the taste of the flour, then take it off the fire 
and add yolks of two eggs, stirring quickly. One table- 
spoon lemon juice, two of salad oil. Put this around, not 
over, the fish. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon.

to flavor mint sauce, etc. 

^ Pepper Vinegar— Tarragon Vinegar, 

Fill a quart bottle with small peppers, either green or 
ripe; put in two tablespoonfuls sugar and fill with good 
cider vinegar. 

Tarragon vinegar can be made after the above recipe, 
■only substituting three ounces of tarragon leaves (to be 
bought of first-class grocers) for the peppers. The article 
recommended is Vinagre Estragone, prepared in Bordeaux. 

91 Fish Sauce. 

One heaping tablespoon of flour, three-fourths of a cup 
of butter, j^olks of three eggs. Stir these until smooth, 
then stir in a little cold water and add boiling water until 
as thick as you want it. Add the juice of one lemon and 
slice in the lemon, salt, pepper, nutmeg, a little mustard 
and parsley. Vinegar if not tart enough. Boil until well 
cooked and smooth. Str.ain if necessary.

^2 Dutch Sauce— For Fish (Sauce HoUandaise). 

One-lialC teaspoonful of flour, two ounces of butter, four 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar — tarragon vinegar is best — yolk 
of two eggs, juice of half a lemon, salt to the taste. Put 
all the ingredients except the lemon juice into a stewpan. 
Set it over the fire and stir constantly until it heats (but 
Hiot boils). Add the lemon.

93 Sauce Tart&re (A Cold Sauce). 

We take from Mrs. Henderson this recipe : To a scant 
half pint of Mayonnaise sauce, made with the mustard 
added, mix in two tablespoonfuls of capers, one small shal- 
lot (a quarter of an onion is a poor substitute), two gher- 
kins or two ounces of cucumber, and one tablespoonful of 
parsley, all chopped very fine. This sauce will keep a long 
time bottled and corked, and is delicious for fried fish, 
fried oysters, boiled cod-fish, cold tongue or salads. 

94 Mushroom Sauce. 

Take a ladleful of stock, free from grease, from the 
stock-pot, add to it part of the juice from the can of mush- 
rooms; thicken it with a little flour and butter mixed, add 
pepper, salt, and a few drops of lemon juice; now add the 
mushrooms. Let them simmer a few minutes. Pour the 
sauce over the fillet of beef and serve. 

95 Fish Sauce (Qrand Hotel, Paris), Sauce Hollandaise. 

Place in a saucepan the yolks of six eggs, and a little 
pepper; put them in a vessel of hot water, or over a very 
slow fire. Stir quickly, adding, little by little, one pound 
of the freshest butter to every six eggs. When the but- 
ter is melted and mixed, pass through a sieve; add the 
juice of a lemon, or a little vinegar. To keep it hot, 
return the saucepan to the vessel of hot water.

BEEF. 



% Roast Beef. 

Wipe the joint dry; then place it on a pan, with the fat 
and akin side up; put into a hot oven, and when the heat 
has started enough of the oil of the fat to baste with, open 
the oven, and drawing the pan toward you, take up a spoon- 
ful of the grease and pour over the meat for a few times, 
closing the door immediately; this should be repeated four 
or five times during the pi'ocess of roasting. When nearly 
done sprinkle with salt, and baste. Have ready a warm 
platter, and when the meat is dished drain off the grease, 
carefully keeping back the rich, brown juice which has 
exuded from the meat. 

This remaining gravy leave in the pan, placing it on the 
stove and adding about a gill of water, or soup stock, let 
it come to a boil and then pour it over the meat. If a 
made gravy is preferred, more water should be added and 
a little flour. Salt hardens and toughens meat, therefore 
in beef and mutton it should not be put on till it is cooked. 
It is also necessary to have the oven hot in order that the 
heat may quickly sear the surface, which will prevent the 
juice from escaping. It is obvious, if water is put in the 
pan, this quick searing cannot be effected; water cannot be 
raised above a certain temperature (its boiling point), while 
fat is susceptible of a much greater degree of heat, and, 
therefore, as a basting agent, is pieferable. Beef roasted

before a fire has a flavor inexpressibly finer than that done 
in an oven. 

[We recommend Yorkshire pudding to be cooked and 
eaten Avith roast beef. — Ed.] 

YoRKSHiBK Pudding. — One pint of milk, two-thirds of 
a cup of flour, three eggs, and one scant teaspoonful of 
salt. Beat the eggs very light, add salt and milk, and then 
pour about half a cnpf ul of the milk on the flour, and when 
perfectly smooth add the remainder. This makes enough 
for six persons. Raise your roast of beef on bars or a 
stand, pour under it into the hot pan and dripping this 
pudding, let it bake under the beef thirty or forty minutes. 

97 Fillet of Beef. 

The fillet is the under side of the loin of beef^ that por- 
tion from which porter-house steaks are cut. This under 
side or fillet is covered with skin or fat. Loosen the rib 
bones and leave a little of the fat on the opposite side,, 
trim the thick sinewy skin carefully off. This operation 
is very simple, yet it requires great precision. Lard the 
beef with a fine larding needle and nice salt pork. After 
it is trimmed and larded, put it into a small baking pan, 
on the bottom of which, is some chopped pieces of pork 
and beef suet, sprinkle some salt, pepper and flour over it, 
and put a large ladleful of hot stock into the bottom of 
the pan, or it may be simply basted with boiling water. 
Half an hour before dinner put it into the oven. Baste it 
often, supplying a little hot stock, if necessary. 

Miss Parloa says this is one of the simplest, safest and 
most satisfactory dishes that a lady can prepare for either 
her own family or guests. 



42 BEEF. 

First remove from the fillet with a sharp knife every 
•shred of muscle ligament, and thin, tough skin. If it is not 
then a good round shape, skewer into such. Draw a line 
through the center and lard with strips of pork from each 
side so that the lardoons meet in the center. 

Dredge well with salt, pepper and flour, and put with- 
out water in a very small pan. Place in a hot oven for 
thirty minutes. Let it be on the bottom of the oven the 
first ten, then raise it to the upper grate to finish. 

Serve with Mushroom, Hollandaise or Tomato Sauce, or 
with a garniture of roasted tomatoes and Saratoga or 
Julien potatoes. 

98 Beef a la Mode. 

Take the bone out of a small round of beef, cut some 
salt pork in strips, about the size of your two fingers, and 
the thickness of the beef; dip them in vinegar and roll 
them in the following seasoning: One grated nutmeg, one 
tablespoon ful black pepper, one of ground cloves, one of 
allspice and two of salt; add parsley, thyme, sweet marjo- 
ram and summer savory; then cut openings about four 
inches apart all through the beef and insert them. Make 
a rich stufting with bread crumb, etc.; lay it over the top. 
Put the whole into a covered pan, pour over it half a pint 
of vinegar and let it stand in the oven for five hours. The 
addition of vegetables, one large onion, four carrots and 
two turnips, chopped fine, is a great improvement. Half 
an hour before serving skim off the fat, take up the round 
and vegetables, and add a little browned flour to the gravy; 
this is as delightful a dish as a turkey when fowl is no 
Jonger in season. 



BBEF. 43 

99 A la Mode Beef. 

Take a i-ountl of beef, from three to four inches thick, 
and pound well, make as many incisions in the meat as 
possible, mix thoroughly blades of onions with ground 
cloves, salt and pepper, and into each incision, put two 
blades of onions with one long narrow strip of pork. When 
the roast is filled in this way pack tightly in a jar and 
cover with vinegar. Let stand two days, turning twice in 
that time. To cook it, put butter and pork in a covered 
pan, lay in the meat, add a little water to prevent burning. 
Cover it closely and let it roast for four hours ; season 
again with pepper and salt, and one pulverized laurel leaf, 
and dish when nicely browned. To make the gravy, add 
two tablespoonfuls of the vinegar in which the meat has 
been pickled to the liquid remaining in the pan, thicken 
with browned flour. 

100 To Cook a Steak. 

The choice of cut varies with the taste of a family — 
porterhouse, tenderloin, round or rump ; the two latter 
require more beating with the steak-beater to break tlie 
tougher fiber. Break somewhat the fiber of the meat by 
beating with a steak-beater ; lay the gridiron over bright 
but not too hot coals ; place the steak on it, turn in two 
minutes, then again in two minutes. Take up the steak 
and press it into some soft butter on a warm platter ; turn 
and press the other side ; now lay again on the gridiron 
and finish by turning once or twice. A folding gridiron 
expedites and simplifies the cooking of steak. When 
sufficiently cooked place the steak on a warm platter on 
which is some soft butter, considerable salt and a dash of 
pepper ; turn and press. Serve instantly. It is better to 



44 BEEB\ 

have the gentleman of the house wait for his steak than 
have the steak wait for the gentleman — be snubbed for 
having a thing good rather than have it poor. We de- 
cline to give a receipt for frying steak, 

101 Miss Parloa's Method for Beefsteak. 

Have it cut thick. It will never be good, rich and juicy 
if only from one-fourth to one-half an inch thick. It 
ought to be at least three-quarters of an inch thick. Trim 
off any suet that may be left on it and dredge with salt, 
pepper and flour. Cook in the double boiler before or over 
clear coals for ten minutes if to be rare, twelve if it is 
to be rather well done. Turn the meat constantly. Serve 
on a hot dish with butter and salt, or with mushroom sauce, 
maitre iVhotel butter or tomato sauce. Do not stick a 
knife or fork into the meat to try it. This is the way 
many ])eople spoil it. Pounding is another bad habit. 
Much of the juice of the meat is lost. When, as it some- 
times happens, there is no convenience for broiling, heat 
the frying pan very hot, then sprinkle with salt and lay in 
the steak. Turn frequently. 

102 Maitre d'Hotel Butter. 

Four tablespoonfuls of butter, one of vinegar, one of 
lemon juice, half a teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter of a 
teaspoonful o.f pepper, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. 
Beat the butter to a cream and gradually beat in the 
seasoning. This sauce is spread on fried and broiled 
meats and lisli instead of butter. It is particularly nice 
for fish and beefsteak.

To Boil Salt and Fresh Beef and Ham. 



103 To Boil Pickled or Corned Beef. 

Put on the fire in cold water; let it simmer slowly, allow- 
ing fifteen minutes to every pound; do not let it boil; keep 
skimming or it will look dirty; if it is left in the pot until 
the water is cold it will be much more tender. 



lO-t Boiling Meat. 

There is all the difference in the world between boiling 
meat which is to be eaten, and meat whose juices are to be 
extracted in the form of soup. If the meat is required as 
nourishment, of course you want the juices kept in. To 
do this it is necessary to plunge it into boiling water, which 
will cause the albumen in the meat to coagulate suddenly, 
and act as a plug or stopper to all the tubes of the meat, 
so that the nourishment will be tightly kept in. The tem- 
perature of the water should be kept at boiling point for 
five minutes, and then as much cold water must be added 
as will reduce the temperature to one hundred and sixty- 
five degrees. Now if the hot water, in which the meat is 
being cooked, is kept at this temperature for some hours, 
we have all the conditions united, which give to the flesh 
the quality best adapted for its use as food. The juices 
are kept in the meat, and instead of being called upon to 
consume an insipid mass of indigestible fibers, we have a 



46 TO BOIL SALT AND FKESH BEEF AND HAM. 

tender piece of meat, from which, when cut, the imprisoned 
juices run freely. If the meat be allowed to remain in the 
boiling water, without the addition of any cold water to 
it, it becomes in a short time altogether cooked, but it will 
be almost indigestible, and therefore unpalatable. 



105 Beef Stew. 

This is a favorite dish with gentlemen. Two pounds of 
clear beef, from a nice, tender round, and cut an inch or 
an inch and a-half thick, one onion, two slices of carrot, 
two of turnip, two potatoes; put three tablespoonfuls of 
flour (in your dredging box), salt, pepper, and a generous 
quart of boiling water. Cut all the fat from the meat and 
put it in a stewpan; fry gently ten or fifteen minutes. In 
the meantime cut the meat in square pieces; dredge a plate 
with flour; spread the meat on it; dredge again; pile 
another layer of meat on this, and dredge again with flour, 
pepper and salt; cut the vegetables in fine pieces and put 
into the stewpan; with the fat fry them five minutes, stir- 
ring well, to prevent burning; now put in the meat and 
shake it about until it begins to brown; then add the quart 
of boiling water. Cover close and let it boil up once; skim 
and set back where it will just scald for one and a-half 
hours; then add the potatoes, cut in eight pieces, and a 
tablespoonful of flour mixed well with water; let the stew 
come to a boil and boil ten minutes; then add dumplings 
as per receipt dumplings for fricasseed chicken. Cover 
close and boil rapidly for ten minutes. Mutton, lamb and 
veal may be stewed in this way, except that you will use 
salt pork instead of the fat of these meats.

with a quart of water (or more if the quantity of bones 
require it); let this boil for an hour; strain this liquor and 
add the meat prepared for the stew. Then put in two 
onions, two carrots, one turnip; let these boil half an hour 
or more; then about forty-five minutes before serving put 
in twelve potatoes, whole or cut in half; let these boil 
twenty-five minutes, then stir in two tablespoonfuls of 
flour mixed smooth, with water, pepper, salt and a table- 
spoonful of butter. The dumplings are made with the 
receipt for soda and cream of tartar biscuits, and dropped 
into the stew when the liquor is at a keen boil. Boil from 
fifteen to twenty minutes, with the pot well covered; 
serve in a hot platter with the dumplings on top.

Most persons boil a ham, but a tirst-rate Virginia house- 
wife tells us it is much better if baked properly. Soak it 
for au hour or more aud wipe dry. Next spread it all over 
with a batLer made of flour aud water; put it into a deep 
pan with muffin rings or bits of oak wood under it to keep 
it out of the gravy. When fully done — it will take from 
five to seven hours — take off the skin and batter crusted 
upon the flesh side and set it away to cool, or glaze it by 
the following receipt: 



109 G-lazed Ham. 

Beat the yolk of two eggs very light. Spread them all 
over your ham; then sift over fine cracker crumbs, aud set 
in the oven to brown. Currant jelly may be used instead 
•of yolks of eggs, and is very nice. 



110 To Boil a Ham as it is Done at the Parker House, 
Boston, 

A ham weighing ten or twelve pounds should be boiled 
six hours. Wash and scrape the ham well. Put it into 
cold water enough to cover it well and stir into the water 
a teacupful of weak lye. Let it come to a boil gradually; 
keep hot water ready to fill up the boiler as it evaporates. 
If it is to be eaten cold, have readv a large pan in which 
to put your ham, and cover it with cold water, letting it 
stand an hour or two, or until it is cold. Take it up and 
a-emove the skin and ornament as you choose.

112 To Hoast a Leg of Veal. 

Take out the bone of the jomt ; then fill it with a 
stuffing. Dredge well with flour. (See receipt, No. 126, 
for turkey stuffing). Bind tight with skewers and cord, 
sprinkle over with pepper and salt, put two or three slices 
of pork in the bottom of the pan, with a teacupful of 
water. Baste well and often. Let a leg weighing twelve 
pounds cook three hours. Just before it is done sprinkle 
over a little flour and rub over a little butter. 

For gravy, stir some brown flour in the pan in which 
the veal has been cooked, add a piece of butter size of a 
walnut, and a teacup of stock. 

113 Veal Cutlets. 

Veal cutlets should be cut one inch thick from the leg, 
divide into equal sized pieces, enough for a helping. Have 
ready a bowl of bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt 
and a little summer savory, beat two eggs in a pie plate, 
dip the raw cutlets in the egg, crumb them well and lay 
into a frying-pan, containing a heaping tablespoonful of 
butter and the same of lard when it is at a keen boil, 
over a bright fire, lay in your cutlet and fry quickly on 
one side until a bright brown, turn and fry on the other. 
Let them cook until well done. Lay the cutlets on a hot 
platter, add to the butter in the pan a tablespoonful of 
browned flour, and let heat until quite dark ; then pour 
in gradually a teacupful of milk or cream, and scald to a 
glaze. Pour around the cutlets and serve promptly.

SWEET-BREADS. 



114 Veal Sweet-breads 

Spoil very soon; the moment they come from the butch- 
er's they should be put in cold water to soak for about an 
hour; lard them or draw a lardoon of pork through the 
center of each one; put into sail boiling water or stock 
and let boil for fifteen or twenty minutes; throw them into 
cold water for only a few moments, they will now be firm 
and white; remove carefully the skinny portion and pipes. 

Mrs. Hendekson. 

115 Sweet-breads, Stewe5. 

Wash carefully, remove all bits of skin and fatty matter, 
cover with cold water and heat to a boil; pour off the hot 
water and cover with cold until the sweet-breads are firm. 
If liked, add butter as for frying before you put in the 
second water; stir in a very little flour the second time. 
When they are tender add for each sweet-bread a heaping 
teaspoonful of butter, a little chopped parsley, pepper, 
salt and a little cream. Let them simmer in this gravy for 
five minutes. Send to table in a covered dish with the 
gravy poured over them.

ger, basting meanwhile twice with melted butter. Keep 
hot in a dish while you add to the dripping half a cup of 
hot water, some chopped parsley, a teaspoouful of browned 
flour and the juice of half a lemon. Pour over the sweet- 
breads and serve at once. 

117 Sweet-breads, an English Method. 

Wash the sweet-bread and remove all the adhering bits 
of skin, then soak in salt water for one hour, then parboil 
and skim; when half cooked take out and cut into small 
pieces, or, if you prefer, let it remain whole, and stew until 
tender, then add a bit of butter, a little salt, to your taste, 
a dust of pepper, and a teaspoonful of flour thickening. 
Boil up twice and pour over toast. Serve hot. 

118 Broiled Sweet-breads. 

Soak an hour in cold water. Parboil by putting them 
in hot water and keeping it at a fast boil for five minutes 
or longer, then plunging it into ice-cold water, a little 
salted. When the sweet-breads have lain in this ten min- 
utes, wipe them very dry, and with a sharp knife split 
them each in half lengthwise. Broil on a clear, hot fire, 
turning every minute as they begin to drip. Have ready 
on a deep plate some melted butter, well salted and pep- 
pered, mixed with catsup or pungent sauce. When the 
sweet-breads are done to a fine brown, lay them in this, 
turning them over several times, and set covered in a warm 
oven. Lay toast upon a plate or chafing-dish and a sweet- 
bread on each, and pour the hot butter, in which they have 
been lying, over them, and send to the table. 



52 MUTTON AND LAMB. 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 



120 Mutton and Lamb. 

To roast a leg of mutton or lamb is a very simple pro- 
cess, requiring simply to be put in a pan, and thoroughly 
basted and seasoned, baking twelve minutes for every 
pound of lamb and fifteen for every pound of mutton. 

121 To Boil a Leg of Mutton. 

Plunge the mutton into boiling water and let it scald 
fifteen minutes for every pound; in extremely cold weather, 
allow half an hour extra boiling. Serve with drawn but- 
ter, and nasturtions or capers. 

122 Fore Q,Tiarter of Lamb, Eoasted. 

Have your butcher take out carefully the shoulder blade 
and fore leg. Stuff the cavity; close with a skewer or sail 
needle and twine; cook eleven minutes to the pound, bast- 
ing often. Make a gravy by adding a little browned flour 
and half a teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce to the drippings 
and bastings left in the pan. Serve with mushroom pickles 
and boiled spinach, or mint sauce. 

123 Saddle of Mutton. 

It is not every butcher that knows how to cut a saddle 
of mutton, but insist upon its being cut and trimmed as for 
a saddle of venison. Hang it from six to ten days. Rub 
thickly with soft butter or lay thin slices of salt pork all 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 53 

over the top; lay the flaps under. Then fold around it a 
paste made of only flour and water, but of the consistency 
of pie crust. Lay slices of i:)ork under it and put it in 
your pan with the flaps resting on the pork, that is stand- 
ing in it like an arch. Roast an hour and a-half. Serve 
with a rich brown gravy made from the liquor in the pan; 
after the fat has been skimmed off and seasoned, a small 
slice of onion, six pepper corns, four whole cloves and two 
tablespoonfuis of currant jelly. After removing the paste 
cover, and while making the gravy, dredge the saddle with 
flour and let it brown in a hot oven. 

124 Pore Quarter of Lamb, Broiled. 

This is the most delicious method of cooking lamb. 
Choose a young and tender, but small fore quarter; have it 
well nicked by the butcher, and forty minutes before din- 
ner place it on the gridiron over bright, but not too hot 
coals; every ten minutes baste it on both sides with a bit 
of butter and turn on the gridiron; send it to table just off 
the fire and well buttered; it will make its own gravy; it 
should be done thoroughly, that is, past the pink color 
demanded by French cooks, but not enough to dry the 
natural juices of the meat. 

125 Mutton Cutlets, Breaded. 

Season French chops with salt and pepper; dip them in 
melted butter and roll in fine bread crumbs; broil for 
eight minutes over a fire not too bright, as the crumbs burn 
easily. Serve with potato-balls heaped in the center of 
the dish. 



54 PORK. 



PORK. 

126 Leg of Fresh Pork, Roasted. 

Score in crossed lines a leg of pork, run the knife around 
the bone until it is loosened, take out the bone and fill 
the place with a rich stuffing made of stale bread, seasoned 
with butter, salt, pepper and onion ; take a few stitches to 
prevent the stuffing coming out ; ])ut it on the spit and 
baste it with fresh butter (it is more delicate than lard). 
Fresh pork requires longer cooking than any other meat. 
Serve with hot apple sauce and Irish potatoes, cut in 
quarters and fried. It will take from three to four hours 
to cook, according to size. 

127 Pork Spare Hibs 

Are best well broiled over a slow fire served with hot 
apple sauce. 

128 Pork Tenderloins 

Are either fried or broiled. In either case they require to 
be ver}'^ thoroughly done and served without gravy, simply 
adding a tablespoonful of vinegar to the dripping from 
the gridiron or in the pan. 

129 To Broil Salt Pork. 

Soak some thin slices of salt pork in milk for two or 
three hours, lay on the fine double gridiron and turn 
quickly, so as not to scorch ; this makes a delicious supper 
if cooked and eaten promptly. It should not be taken off 
the coals till the family ai*e seated at the table. Serve on 
a very hot dish. 



PORK. 55 

130 To Fry Salt Pork. 

Salt pork is greatly improved by soaking it in milk two 
or three hours, then rolling it in Indian meal before frying. 

131 To Bake Salt Pork. 

Let it soak over night in skimmed milk, then bake like 
fresh pork. 

132 Pork and Beans. 

One quart of beans soaked over night in tepid water, in 
which has been dissolved one teaspoonful of soda. Early 
in the morning pour this water off, add two quarts of boil- 
ing water and half a teaspoonful of soda, boil the beans 
two hours, until the skin cracks. Then drain, put into a 
bean pot, large tin or earthen dish, in the center of which, 
is a pound of salt pork scored in small squares. Let the 
beans come up to the level of the rind of the pork, pour 
over this one quart of boiling water, in which two table- 
spoonfuls of molasses have been stirred. Cover and bake 
slowly from two to four hours. If necessary you may add 
a teacup more of boiling water. Baking in a Boston bean 
pot is a great improvement.

POULTRY AND GAME. 



133 Turkey and Chicken Stuffing. 

Three teacups of grated bread-crumbs (no crust and not 
a drop of water), one cup finely chopped suet, two-thirds 
of a cup chopped parsley, a tablespoonful of sweet marjo- 
ram and summer savory, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one or two eggs, beaten. 

184 To Eoast a Turkey or Chicken. 

In England and on the continent, neither a turkey nor 
chicken is stuffed; but not only is the stuffing nice in itself, 
but it gives as well as preserves a fine flavor to the fowl. 
After drawing, washing, drying and singeing a fowl, stuff 
it according to the above recipe, craw and body; truss it 
well, tying down the legs and fastening the wings. Put 
into a dripping pan (or on to a spit) the bird thus prepared, 
and let cook till thoroughly done, but not dry. A four- 
teen-pound turkey will take three full hours; a ten-pound 
turkey will do in two. Save the giblets, consisting of 
liver, gizzard and heart, boil until tender, and mince fine. 
When you take up your turkey, add a little browned flour 
to the gravy in the pan, some hot water, and the minced 
giblets, a few sprigs of parsley about the dish adds greatly 
to its appearance. Many persons like fried sausages, or 
fried oysters, laid about the dish, and served with each 
helping.

135 To Boil a Chicken or Turkey. 

It is not every housewife who knows how best to boil a 
chicken. Plain, artless boiling is apt to produce a yellowish^ 
slimy-looking fowl. Before cooking, the bird should always 
be washed in tepid water and rubbed with lemon juice^ 
tlien stuffed and trussed, and to insure whiteness, delicacy 
and succulence, should be boiled in a thin soup made of flour 
stirred into milk and added to tlie water; after being 
put into the boiling water it should be allowed to simmer 
slowly. This method is very effectual in preserving all the 
juices of the fowl, and the result is a more toothsome and 
nourishing morsel than the luckless bird which has been 
"galloped to death" in plain boiling water, 

136 Broiled Chicken. 

Singe the chicken and split down the back, if not already 
prepared, and wipe with a damp cloth; never wash it; sea- 
son well with salt and pepper; take some soft butter in the 
right hand and rub over the bird, letting the greater part 
go on the breast and legs; dredge with flour; put in the 
double broiler and broil over a moderate fire, having the 
breast turned first to the coals. When the chicken is a 
nice brown, which will be in about fifteen minutes, place 
in a pan and put in a moderate oven for twelve minutes. 
Place on a hot dish and season with salt, pepper and butter. 
The chicken is improved by serving with maitre d^hotel 
butter. Miss Parloa. 

[NoTA Bena. — Of this receipt we can only say that in 
the main it is excellent, but for ourselves we prefer not ta 
dredge with flour, and not to set in an oven to finish. 
Broiling is a fine art, and a chicken or quail should be 
rushed from the gridiron to the table without any maitre 
cV hotel butter, only its own rich, hot juices and the best of 
butter.] 



58 POULTRY AND GAME. 

137 Escaloped Turkey. 

Take the remains of cold turkey, from which remove all 
the bones and gristle; chop the meat in small pieces. Place 
in an earthen dish a layer of powdered cracker, moistened 
with milk; then add a layer of turkey seasoned with pep- 
per and salt, then another layer of powdered cracker, and 
then one of turkey, and so on until the dish is filled; over 
that pour the gravy you may have left, or a little hot water 
and butter, or cream. Finish the top with the powdered 
•cracker, moisten with a beaten egg and sweet milk, bake 
one hour. Cover the dish for the first half hour, that the 
top may not become too brown. 

138 Prairie Chickens, Partridges and Gluail. 

Clean thoroughly, using a little soda in the water in 
which they are washed; rinse them and drain, and fill with 
dressing, sewing them up nicely, and binding down the 
legs and wings with cord, or trussing with fine skewers. 
Then put theni in a pan with a little butter, lay slices of 
thin pork over them, set them in the oven and baste fre- 
quently, until of a nice brown. The large bird ought to 
Thrown in about thirty-five minutes. Serve them in a platter 
with sprigs of parsley alternated with currant jelly. 

139 A Nice Way to Cook Pigeons. 

Stufi:' the birds with a rich bread di'essing; place com- 
pactly in an iron or earthen dish; season with salt, pepper 
and butter (or if you like best, thin slices of salt pork over 
the top), dredge thickly with flour and nearly cover them 
with water. Then put over a closely fitting plate or cover, 
and place the dish in a moderate oven, from two to four, or 
even five, hours, according to the age of the birds. If the 



POULTRY AND GAME. 59 

birds are old and tough, this is the best way they can be 
cooked, and they may be made perfectly tender and much 
sweeter than by any other process. If the gravy is insuffi- 
cient add a little water before dishing. 

140 To Pot Birds. 

Prepare them as for roasting. Fill each with a dressing 
made as follows: Allow for each bird of the size of a 
pigeon one-half of a hard boiled egg, chopped fine, a table- 
spoonful of bread crumbs, a teaspoonful of chopped pork; 
season the bird with pepper and salt; stuff them, lay them 
in a kettle that has a tight cover. Place over the birds a 
few slices of pork, add a pint of water, dredge over them 
a little flour, cover and put them in a hot oven. Let them 
cook until tender, then add a little cream and buttei*. If 
the sauce is too thin, thicken with flour. One pint of 
water suflicient for twelve birds. 

141 Fricassea Chicken. 

Cut up, wash and dry a pair of chickens, and dredge 
them well with flour, salt and pepper; put into a stewpan 
a heaping tablespoon ful of butter, let it boil; lay the chick- 
ens into this and shake them about, turning them and giv- 
ing each piece a little glazed look; then add water enough 
to cover the fowls and let stew slowly from forty minutes 
to an hour. Just before serving let it come to a keen boil 
and stir in a teacupful of milk or sweet cream, in which a 
heaping tablespoonful of flour has been stirred. Let it 
cook five minutes and pour into a dish over which some 
freshly baked powder biscuits have been opened and 
spread. Season with salt and pepper, I butter my 
biscuits.

142 Fricassee Chicken, ITo. 2 (French Style). 

Cut up a young chicken, dredge well with flour (even a 
grown one, if young and tender, Avill do), flavor well, put 
in a frying-pan one tablespoonful of hot lard, cut up a 
small onion, let it fry with the chicken, adding salt, red 
and black pepper. Do not cook entirely done, and be care- 
ful not to scorch; then pour into the frying-pan enough 
boiling water for the chicken to stew, which let it do for 
an hour, and just before taking it off add some chopped 
parsley. 

143 Dumpling for Fricasseed Chicken. 

If dumplings are preferred to biscuit there is no better 
recipe for them than Miss Parloa's. 

One pint of flour measured before sifting, half a tea- 
spoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one 
of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt. Mix all thoroughly 
and run through a sieve. Wet with a small cupful of 
milk. Sprinkle a little flour on the board, turn the dough 
(which should have been stirred into smooth ball with a 
spoon) on it, roll to the thickness of half an inch, cut into 
small cakes and cook ten minutes. No more, no less. 

By remembering that the soup should be boiling rapidly 
when the dumplings are put in, that they should not sink 
too deep in the liquid, and that the cover of the pot is shut 
tight, success will be insured, 

144 Escalloped Chicken. 

Cold chicken, chiefly the white meat, one cup of gravy^ 
one tablespoonful of butter and one Qg^ well beaten, one 
cup of fine bread crumbs, pepper and salt. Take from 
the chicken all gristle and skin, and cut, not chop, into- 



POULTRY AND GAME. 61 

pieces, less than half an inch long, Have ready the 
gravy, or some rich drawn butter in a saucepan on the 
fire. Thicken it well, and stir into it the chicken ; boil up 
once, take it off and add the beaten egg ; cover^the bottom 
of a buttered dish with bread crumbs, pour in the mixture 
and put another thick layer of crumbs on top, sticking 
butter all over it. Bake to a delicate brown in a quick 
oven. Turkey raaj^ be used instead of chicken, also veal. 

145 Chicken Pie, No. 1. 

Dredge well with flour and stew until tender two 
chickens in just enough water to cover them. Make a 
nice crust, line a deep dish with it ; when the chickens are 
done remove all the bones ; put the chickens in the dish in 
which they are to be baked ; thicken the gravy with a 
little flour and cream ; add a can of oysters ; season with 
salt, pepper and butter ; cover the pie with a crust, and 
bake quickly. This is very nice. 

146 Eice and Chicken Pie, ITo. 3. 

Boil a pint or more of rice; stir in a teaspoonful of but- 
ter, a little milk, two eggs and a little salt. Fricassee two 
chickens. Cover the bottom of a long dish with rice, then 
a layer of chicken, and so until it is full. Save out some 
of the gravy of the fricassee to eat on the rice. Cover the 
whole with the yolk of an egg and brown it. Curry pow- 
der may be put into the chicken if liked. One chicken 
makes a good sized dish. 

147 Chicken Jelly. 

Boil the chicken until tender, cut with a knife fine, put 
it in a dish, or mold; season with salt,'pepper, a little sum- 
mer savory, and a teaspoonful of vinegar; boil the bones in 
the broth awhile and pour over. When cold it will turn out.

size), seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper, and a table- 
spoonful of flour. Fry this in one side of the frying-pan 
until brown, then mix with the chicken, ochras, etc.; pour 
on six cups of cold water, and let all boil two hours over a 
slow fire. Eat with boiled rice, unless used as a first course 
in place of soup. This is sufiicient for six persons. 

149 Chicken Pie. 

Cut up and dredge well with flour, pepper and salt, two 
chickens; put them in a round-bottomed kettle where a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter has come to a boil; toss 
the chickens aboixt for five or ten minutes, till their juice 
begins to start, then pour over them boiling water 
enough to cover them well; let them scald, but not boil, 
for one hour, then take out all the large bones, i. e., legs, 
backs, neck-pieces, breast bones, etc., leaving only the wings 
and second joints. Cut the meat as little as possible, but 
in shapely pieces. Make a rich crnst, roll it thicker than 
for ordinary pies. Line the bottom of the dish with a 
plainer under crust, lay the chicken in, season well with 
salt and pepper, pour over this the rich gravy in which the 
fowls were boiled with a teacup of cream and a heaping 
tablespoonful of flour braided with butter,and well scalded. 
Cover with rich paste and bake three-quarters of an hour.

151 Potatoes a la Maitre d'Hotel. 

Boil and peel the potatoes and let them become cold. 
Then cut them into rather thick slices. Put a lump of fresh 
butter into a stewpan, and add a little flour — about a tea- 
spoonful for a middling sized dish. When the flour has 
boiled a litte while in the butter, add by degrees a cupful 
of broth or water. When this has boiled up, put in the 
potatoes with chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Let the 
potatoes stew a few minutes, then take them from the fire^ 
and, when quite off the boil, add the yolk off an egg, 
beaten up with a little lemon juice and a tablespoonful of 
cold water. As soon as the sauce has set, the potatoes may 
be dished up and sent to the table. 

152 Boiled Potatoes.— Miss Parloa. 

The time of cooking the potato does not vary with age 
or freshness. Twelve medium sized potatoes, one table- 
spoonful of salt, boiling water enough to cover. Pare the 



^4 VEGETABLES. 

potatoes, and, if old, let them stand in cold water an hour 
or two to freshen them. Boil fifteen minutes, then add the 
salt and boil fifteen minutes longer. Pour off every drop 
of water. Take the cover off and shake the potatoes in a 
current of cold air, at either the door or window; place the 
saucepan on the back part of the stove, and cover with a 
clean, coarse towel until serving time. The sooner the 
potatoes ai'e served the better. 

153 Mashed Potatoes. 

Prepare as directed for boiled potatoes. Mash fine and 
stir into them a half a cupful of boiling milk and a table- 
spoonful of butter. Then take your pot stick or wooden 
spoon and stir with all your might, round and round, for a 
minute or two. This will give great lightness and delicacy. 

154 Tried Potatoes. 

Pare and slice the potatoes thin; if sliced in small flakes 
they look more inviting than when cut in larger pieces; 
keep in ice-water two or three hours, then drain them dry, 
or dry them on a crash towel, and drop them into boiling 
lard; when nearly done take them out with a skimmer and 
drain them. Let them get cold, and then drop them again 
into boiling lard, and fry until well done. This last oper- 
ation causes them to swell up and puff out; sprinkle with 
salt and serve hot, our recipe says; but many like them 
cold, as a relish for tea or with cold meats. 

155 Potato Puff. 

Stir two cupfuls of mashed potatoes, two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter and some salt to H light, fine and creamy 
condition; then add two eggs, well beaten (separately) and 



VEGETABLES. 65 

six tablespoonfuls of cream; beat it all well and lightly 
together; pile it in a rocky form on a dish; bake it in a 
quick oven until nicely colored; it will puff up quite light. 

156 Potato Fritters. 

Mash and rub through a colander six good boiled pota- 
toes; add a little salt, two tablespoonfuls of sweet milk or 
cream, two tablespoonfuls of flour, one egg and the yolks 
of two others; beat the reserved whites to a stiff froth, 
and stir it into the other ingredients, after they are well 
mixed. Have ready a spider of hot lard, and di'op by the 
spoonful, and boil as other fritters. This is a delicious 
breakfast dish. 

157 Creaming Potatoes. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes very thin, have ready a sauce- 
pan of boiling milk, in which place the potatoes, with salt, 
a good sized piece of butter, and while boiling, thicken 
with flour, mixed with water, stirring until delicate and 
creamy — when ready dish for the table. The goodness of 
this dish depends much upon catering, jast when ready;

Parsnips prepared in this way, are extremely nice.

Second way: Cut your salsify into round lozenges, par- 
boil; throw it into a frying-pan with a little butter, and 
heat through, but do not fry brown; turn over this enough 
soup stock, or the boilings from steak or other bones, to 
cover it; thicken with a little flour and butter braided 
together, add pepper and salt, and you have a nice dish. 

159 Oyster Plant. 

Scrape the roots, dropping each into cold water as soon 
as cleaned. Exposure to the air blackens them. Cut in 
pieces an inch long, put into a saucepan with hot water to 
cover them, and stew until tender. Turn off the water 
and add soup stock or milk enough to cover them. Stew 
ten minutes after this begins to boil ; put in a great lump 
of butter cut into bits and rolled in flour. Boil up once 
and serve. 

160 Fried Salsify or Mock Oysters. 

Scrape the roots thoroughly and lay in cold water ten 
or fifteen minutes. Boil whole until tender, and when 
cold mash with a wooden spoon to a smooth paste, picking 
out all the fibers. Moisten with one teacup of cream, a 
little milk, add a tablespoonful of butter, and three eggs 
for every two cupfuls of salsify. Beat the eggs light. 
Make into round cakes, dredge with flour and fry brown. 

161 Cooking Carrots. 

Cut the carrots in small pieces and stew in a little water 
till tender ; pour off what water is left ; put in milk enough

162 Asparagus. 

Aspai'agus should be boiled in fresh water, and when 
thoroughly cooked taken out, salted, laid lengthwise upon 
pieces of toast in a deep dish ; pour over a sauce for aspara- 
gus, made after this fashion: Take equal parts of flour 
and butter, a tablespoouful of each; mix thoroughly, add 
a pint of water and a little salt; cook in a stewpan; when 
done remove from the fire, and if you desire, stir in the 
beaten yolk of an egg. Some persons cut asparagus into 
inch-long pieces, but a genuine '' bon vivant" prefers to 
€at only so much as glides off into his mouth from the 
four inch-long stalk. 

163 A Dainty Way of Serving Asparagus. 

Take the smallest Vienna breads and prepare them as in 
the receipt for croustade of oysters. When ready fill them 
with the heads of asparagus an inch long and which have 
been cooked according to the above receipt. This makes 
a nice and pretty course at a lady's lunch. 

164 Radishes. 

Prof. Blot says, cut off the root and all the leaves, but the 
■center one, or stalk. This should always be left on and 
eaten, as it contains an element which assists in the diges- 
tion of the radish. Split the radish up into stems, and 
leave whole at the top; serve in fresh ice water. 

165 Spinach. 

To a peck of well washed and picked spinach take a 
gallon of water and three even tablespoonfuls of salt; boil 
for ten minutes or a trifle more, until tender; drain on a 
sieve, press a little with your hands or butter-ladle to 
^extract the water; chop it up fine, put it in a stewpan with 



68 VKGETABLES. 

a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a half a 
teaspooiiful of pepper, one tablespoonful of vinegar, and 
one or two of broth or beef stock; set over a bright fire 
for a few moments, stirring well; lay slices of cold hard- 
boiled eggs over it in the vegetable dish. 

166 Tomatoes. 

Plain stewed tomatoes perfectly done and seasoned with 
salt and pepper, need only a large lump of butter added, 
although it is quite common to stir in half a teacup of 
bread or cracker crumbs. 

167 Escalloped Tomatoes. 

Peel and cut across the tomato in slices a quarter of an 
inch thick, lay layers of tomato, then sprinkling of fine 
bread crumbs seasoned with pepper and salt, then bits of 
butter; repeat and end with bread crumbs and butter; bake 
an hour and a quarter. 

168 Stuffed Tomatoes. 

Choose large tomatoes; do not skin them, but cut a 
round off the top and scoop out the inside, which fill with 
a stuffing made of bread crumbs, minced onion, cayenne 
and salt; first fry the onions in a little butter, with what 
was scooped out of the tomatoes, add the bread crumbs, 
moistened with a little water or stock, and seasoned with a 
very little cayenne pepper, salt, and a little Worcester 
sauce. Fry these a moment; then fill the cavities, allow- 
ing the stuffing to project half an inch above the tomatoes 
and smooth it over the top. On this place a salt-spoon- 
ful of parmesan cheese and a bit of butter. Bake 
thoroughly.

169 Succotash. 

Cut the corn from a dozen ears of corn, being careful 
not to cut into the cob. Boil one pint of Lima beans in 
three pints of water two hours; boil also, the cobs, as 
they contain much saccharine matter, with the beans. Take 
out the cobs and put in the corn. Just before taking up, 
mix a heaping tablespoonful of butter with one teaspoon- 
ful of flour, some salt and pepper. A cup of good cream 
is a great improvement. Let your corn boil only twenty- 
five minutes. 

170 Green Corn. 

Cut the center of kernels through lengthwise with a sharp 
knife ; scrape the inside out with the back of the knife ; 
put over and boil with a very little water. After cooking 
ten minutes, add milk, salt, a very little sugar, and plenty 
of butter, and let boil gently for twenty minutes more.

or in a frying-pan. These are very nice for tea when 
made from cold boiled ears of corn left over from dinner. 

172 Corn Oysters, No. 2. 

One teacup of milk, two eggs, two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of flour and a pinch of salt. Beat all well 
together and into this stir the corn cut from one dozen

pour the mashed turnips into it, mix well, and let stew for 
twenty minutes or half an hour then add a tablespoonful 
of butter. 

17'5 Egg Plant. 

Slice the egg plant about a quarter of an inch thick, 
parboil in salt and water for ten minutes, or only soak in 
the same, for families have a choice; then take out and 
fry in part butter and part lard, or dip each slice (after 
drying it) into beaten eggs and then bread crumbs, and 
then fry. Or, slice the plant half an inch thick, soak in 
salt and water one hour, and wipe dry; dip in flour, then 
into beaten egg, then in flour again; fry light brown, serve 
hot. 

176 Egg Plant. 

Slice the egg plant about half an inch thick, soak in 
salt and water an hour; then take out, wipe dry, dip into 
flour, then in beaten egg, then in flour again, and fry in 
part butter and part lard. • 



VEGETABLES. 71 

177 Boiled Cauliflower. 

To each half a gallon of water allow one heaped tea- 
spoonful of salt. Choose cauliflowers that are close and 
white. Trim off the decayed outside leaves, cut the stalk 
off flat at the bottom. Open the flowers a little to remove 
the insects, and let lie in salt and water, with the head 
down, for an hour before cooking; then put them into fast 
boiling water with the addition of salt as above. Skim 
well and boil till tender. Serve with melted butter or deli- 
cate drawn butter poured over the yolk of an egg and 
stirred well. Serve this on the cauliflower. 

178 To stew Cabbage. 

Parboil in milk and water and drain it, then shred it; 
put it into a stewpan with a small piece of butter, a small 
cupful of cream, and seasoning, and stew tender, 

179 Cabbage Jelly. 

Boil a cabbage in the usual way, and squeeze it in a 
colander till perfectly dry, then chop fine; add a little but- 
ter, pepper and salt; press the whole very closely into an 
earthenware mold, and bake one hour, either in an oven or 
in front of the fire.

YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 

180 Old School Presbyterian Yeast. 

Boil two liberal bandf ills of good hops in three quarts of 
water. Strain. When cool stir in one quart of flour, one 
cup of sugar, and a handful of salt. Cover this in a stone 
jar, and let it stand three days in a warm place, stirring it 
occasionally. On the fourth day add one quart of nicely 
mashed potatoes. Let it stand until the day following, 
when it will be ready for use. A small teacup is sufficient 
for five loaves of bread. 

This yeast, which has proved most reliable, needs noth- 
ing to start it, as it is self-raising, and if kept in a cool 
place will keep six weeks in the summer, and three months 
in cold weather. 

It does not foam as do other kinds of yeast, so that one 
who had not used it would think it worthless; but if once 
used its excellency will not be doubted. 

In making bread, a tablespoonful of white sugar to a 
quart of flour is a great improvement to all kinds of bread. 

181 Joanna's Yeast. 

Peel and wash five good sized potatoes, and boil in two 
quarts of water, then mash and add two small cups of 
flour, a handful of salt, and half a cup of sugar, white or 
brown; add potatoes and flour together, and mix slowly in 
the scalding water in which the potatoes were boiled, and 
strain all through the colander. Then add the sugar, salt, 
and a cup of yeast or an yeast cake; keep in a warm place 
until it rises, and then put away in an earthen crock. 



YBAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 73 

Bread made with the above yeast: Sift two quarts of 
flour aud add a little salt, boil three or four potatoes and 
mash in three pints of water and stir in with a cup full of 
yeast. Keep in a warm place over night. 

18'^ Mrs. Isham's Potato Yeast. 

Pare four potatoes and boil in one quart of water; when 
-done mash them fine, and pour on them the water in which 
they were boiled, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half cup of 
brown sugar. When cold add half a teacupful of baker's 
yeast. Put in a warm place to rise. 

183 Esther's Bread. 

To make the yeast: Take ten or twelve potatoes from 
the dinner pot, wet two teacupfuLs of flour with two cups 
of boiling potato water, add half a teacup of white sugar 
and one heaping tablespoonful of salt; raise twenty-four 
hours with a Twin Brothers or Capitol Yeast Cake. This 
will last a week or ten days. One cup anda-half is enough 
for four loaves of the bread. Scald skim milk; when cool 
enough sponge your bread at night; in the morning work 
it well, let it rise, then put it in a pan and let it rise again; 
bake in a quick oven. 

184 To Sponge Bread. 

Sift four quarts of flour into a deep pan, sprinkle a dessert- 
spoonful of salt over it. Make a hole in the center and add, 
by degrees, three pints of lukewarm water or skim milk; stir 
the flour into this till it reaches the consistency of a very 
thick cream; add one and-a-half cups of Esther's yeast, or 
one cup ot Joanna's yeast, or two yeast cakes, or five cents' 
worth of compressed or German yeast, or three cents' worth

of bakers' yeast, or two tablespoonf uls of brewers' yeast. 
German and brewers' yeast requires but two hours, the 
others all night, to raise them. 

185 Brown Bread. 

One quart of corn meal, one pint of rye or Graham flour^ 
one quart of sour milk, one teacup of molasses, and one tea- 
spoonful of soda. Steam four hours, or bake one hour. 
This quantity will make two loaves. 

186 Corn Bread. 

One quart of Indian meal, two ounces of butter, as much 
warm milk as will make a stiff batter, four eggs, a little 
salt. Beat the whole well together, and bake in shallow 
tins in a moderate oven. 

187 Mrs. A.'s Corn Bread. 

Two cupfuls of corn meal, two cupfuls of flour, one cup- 
ful of sweet milk, one cupful of sour milk, one-half cupfiil 
of sugar, two eggs, one tablespoonful of melted butter, 
one teaspoonf ul of soda, and a little salt. 

188 Phillis' Corn Bread. 

One pint of sour milk, one-half pint of sweet milk, one 
teaspoon fui of saleratus, one teaspoonf ul of salt, one- 
tablespoonful of lard or butter. White Indian meal stirred 
in to make a batter, thick, as for muffins. If the meal is 
perfectly sweet stir it in dry. If not, scald it first. 

189 Trench Bread. 

Mrs. Henderson, in her " Practical Cooking," gives this 
recipe which we copy in full, although it is very like the 
old Southern snap bread : Put a heaping tablespoonful 



YEAST, BKEAD AND BISCUIT. 15- 

of hops and a quart of water over the fire to boil. Have 
ready five or six large, freshly boiled potatoes, which mash 
fine ; strain the hops, now put a pint of the boiling water 
in which the potatoes were cooked over three cupfuls of 
flour ; mix in the mashed potatoes, then the quart of 
strained hop- water hot, a heaping teaspoonful of sugar and 
the same of salt ; when this is lukewarm, mix in one-and-a- 
half Twin Brothers' yeast cakes that have been softened in 
a little warm water. Let this stand over night in a warm 
place! 

In the morning a new process is in order. First, pour 
over the yeast a tablespoonful of warm water in which is- 
dissolved half a teaspoonful of soda. Mix in lightly about 
ten-and-a-half heaping teacupfuls of sifted flour. Xo more 
flour is added to the bread during its kneading. Instead 
the hands are wet in lukewarm water. Now Jcnead the 
dough, giving it about eight or ten strokes ; then taking, 
it from the side next to you pull it up into a long lengthy 
then double it, throwing it down snappishly and heavily. 
Wetting the hands again, give it the same number of 
strokes or kneads, pulling the end towards you again and 
throwing it onto the part left in the pan ; continue this 
process until large bubbles are formed in the dough. It 
will take half an hour or longer. The hands should be 
wet enough at first to make the dough rather supple. If 
dexterously managed it will not stick to the hands after a 
few minutes, and when it is kneaded enough it will be very 
elastic, full of bubbles and will not stick to the pan ; then 
put the pan away again in a warm place to rise. This will 
take one or two hours. Now comes another new process :. 
Sprinkle plenty of flour on the board and take out lightly 
enough dough to make one loaf of bread, remembering: 



70 YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 

I hat French loaves are not large nor of the same shape as 
the usual home-made-ones — draw it long so as not to spoil 
the grain of the bread, and with the rolling-pin roll it 
slightly out in the middle; take these middle flaps and fold, 
first one and then the other, into the center of the dough, 
draw it out long, turn the dough completely over and draw 
it long into the conventional shape. Turn a large dripping- 
pan bottom side up, sprinkle plenty of flour on it, upon 
which lay this and the succeeding loaves a little distance 
apart. Set the pan by the fire again to rise yet another 
twenty-five or thirty minutes longer ; then bake. 

190 Miss Parloa's Yeast Bread. 

Ingredients for two loaves: Two quarts of flour, half 
a cupful of yeast, or one cake of compressed yeast, 
nearly a pint and-a-half of water, half a tablespoonful 
each of lard, sugar, and salt. Sift the flour into a bread- 
pan, and after taking out a cupful for use in kneading, 
add the salt, sugar, yeast, and the water, which must 
be about blood warm (or say 100 degrees, if in cold 
weather, and about eighty in the hot season). Beat well 
with a strong spoon. When well mixed sjjrinkle a little 
flour on the board, turn out the dough on this and knead 
from twenty to thirty minutes. Put back in the pan; hold 
the lard in the hand long enough to have it very soft; rub 
it over the dough closely that neither dust nor air can get 
in and set in a warm place. It will rise in eight or nice 
hours. In the morning shape into loaves or rolls. If into 
loaves, let these rise an hour when the temperature is be- 
tween ninety and one hundred degrees; if into rolls, let 
these rise an hour and a half. Bake in an oven that will 
brown a teaspoon ful of flour in five minutes. (The flour 
used for this test should be put on a piece of crockery, as 



TBAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 77 

it will have a more even heat.) The loaves will need from 
forty-five to sixty minutes to bake, but the rolls will be 
done in half an hour if placed close toa^ether in the pan, 
and if French rolls are made they will bake in fifteen min- 
utes. As soon as baked, the bread should be taken out of 
the pans and placed on a table where it can lean against 
something until it is cool. It should then be put in a stone 
pot or tin box which has been thoroughly washed and 
scalded and dried, and be set away in a cool dry place. 

jSticks. — Four cupf uls of flour, one tablespoonf ul of sugar, 
one-fourth of a cake of compressed yeast, one-fourth of a 
cup of butter, one cup of boiled milk, the white of an eggj 
one scant teaspoonful of salt. Dissolve the butter in the 
milk, which should be blood warm. Beat the white of an 
egg to a stiff froth. Dissolve the yeast in three tablespoon- 
fuls of cold water. Add all the other ingredients to the 
flour and knead well. Let the dough rise over night and 
in the morning make into balls about the size of a large 
English walnut. Roll each of these balls into a stick 
about a foot long. Use the molding-board. Place the 
sticks about two inches apart in long pans. Let them rise 
half an hour in a cool place and bake twenty-five minutes 
in a very moderate oven. Sticks should be quite dry and 
crisp. They cannot be if baked rapidly. 

Swedish JBread. — For this Miss Parloa took some of the 
dough left from the rolls or sticks; either will do, and 
rolled it very thin, then she spread over it one tablespoon- 
ful of cinnamon mixed with half a cup of sugar. First, 
moisten the sheet of bread with cold water, then sprinkle 
with the cinnamon and the sugar. Roll very tight, and

191 Parker House Uolls. 

Scald a little more than a pint of milk, let it stand till 
cold; two quarts of flour; make a hole in the middle of the 
flour after rubbing into it a tablespoonf ul of lard or butter, 
then add a half teacup of yeast, a little sugar, salt, and the 
milk, and cover with the flour. Let it stand until morning, 
then work until smooth. When it is light roll out and cut 
with a pint pail cover; rub it over with a little butter and 
lap over like a turnover, then let them bake twenty min- 
utes. They are splendid, and never fail if the directions are 
followed. This is an old receipt, and has been tried and 
endorsed by hundreds of cooks. 

192 Miss Parloa's Parker House Rolls. 

One and a quarter quarts of flour, one pint of cold boiled 
milk, one tablespoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of but- 
ter, one teaspoonf ul of salt, half a cake of compressed yeast. 
Mix the dry ingredients together and then draw to the 
sides of the bowl; pour the yeast, which has been dissolved, 
in a third of a cup of water and the milk; cover the pan; 
let it stand all night; in the morning knead well; let this 
rise to a sponge and then roll down to about three-fourths 
of an inch thick; cut with an oval cutter; let these rise to 
twice their original size and bake about thirty minutes in a 
quick oven. It will be obsersed that these rolls differ from 
ours, by having no butter.

One pint of milk, one quart of flour, whites of two eggs, 
one tablespoonf ul of white sugar, a piece of butter the size 
of au egg. First take the milk and flour, with a table- 
spoonful of yeast, and make a sponge. If made of bakers' 
or home-made yeast, it can be set at night. When the 
sponge is light, add the other ingredients and set to rise 
again; roll out to half an inch in^thickness; cut with an 
oval cutter; bake in a quick oven.

195 Ways of Baking Graham Flour. 

By this time everybody knows how to make Graham 
"gems " by the usual method, which is simply to stir the 
batter just a little stiffer than griddle-cake batter, and bake 
quickly in a very hot oven. One thing is certain, the 
thinner the batter the hotter must be the oven. It is also 
the case that gems mixed with water require a hotter oven 
than those mixed with milk. So, if you can not have a 
very hot oven, either make the mixture of simple Graham 
flour and water quite thick, or mix the flour with milk. 
Skimmed milk is good enough, though new or creamy milk 
makes the bread more "short," of course. Have the gem 
pans very hot (I set them in the oven before filling them), 
and then a scrap of cloth with the least bit of butter upon 
it, rubbed over the irons, will prevent the gems from 
sticking. 



80 YEAST, BREAD AND BISCUIT. 

196 Graham Gems. 

One and-a-half cupfuls of Graham flour, one cupful of 
sweet milk, one eg_^, one tablespoonful of melted butter, 
one tablespoonful of molasses, two scant teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder. Beat the egg, then put in the milk, then 
the flour, with the baking powder well mixed through, and 
last the molasses and butter. Bake in a very hot oven. 



197 G-raham Bread— Miss Parloa. 

One pint of water or milk, one pint of flour, one large 
pint of Graham flour, half a cup of sugar, half a cup of 
yeast, or half a square of compressed yeast, one teaspoonful 
of salt. Have the milk or water blood warm, add the 
yeast to it; have the flour sifted in a deep dish, add 
yeast and milk gradually to the flour, beating until 
perfectly smooth; set in a rather cool place to rise over 
night. In the morning add the salt, sugar and then 
the Graham flour, a little at a time, beating vigorously alL 
the time. When thoroughly beaten, turn into two bread 
pans and let it rise one hour. Bake one hour. 

198 Graham Bread, ITo. 2. 

One quart of Graham flour, three-quarters of a cup of 
yeast, one quart of water, warm, one cup of molasses. Let 
this rise over night. Mix with wheat flour in the morning 
into a stiff loaf; let it rise a second time, afterwards put 
into loaves to rise for baking. Very good.

Boil one quart of milk, with which scald a pint of nice 
corn-meal; beat five eggs, whites and yolks separately; 
add a piece of butter, the size of an egg, and a teaspoon- 
f ul of salt. Stir all together thoroughly and bake immedi- 
ately, while it is still hot. This quantity makes two nice 
loaves, and should be baked half an hour in cast-iron pans

ful of salt, butter, half the size of an egg. Dissolve the 
soda in one cup of sweet milk; beat the eggs light; add 
the milk in which the soda is dissolved and the sour milk 
to the dry ingredients, then the beaten eggs; have a large 
spider, or two small ones, very hot; put the butter in the 
pan and grease the sides well; pour the mixture into the 
spider; now pour the remaining cupful of milk all over the 
batter in the spider, but do not stir it; put the spider into 
the oven and bake from twenty to twenty-five minutes. 



CORN BREAD AND CAKES. 83 

N. B. — In making this cake the butter was accidentally 
rubbed into the corn meal, and more had to be substituted 
to grease the spider. Since then we have always repeated 
that mistake, as it made the cake much richer,

TEA AND BREAKFAST CAKES. 



209 French Breakfast Bolls. 

Take of good bread dough that is ready for its last rising 
what would make a large loaf of bread; cut from this 
pieces of dough about the size for a good biscuit, roll it 
under your hand till it is round; flatten it a little and then 
let it stand on your molding-board till the last of your 
rolls are finished; then let them remain five minutes "to 
prove." At the end of that time have a saucer of soft, 
nice lard ready. Dip the ball of your hand in the lard, 
and press the whole weight of "the heel of your hand" 
across the center of each roll so as to dent it almost 
through. Then fold it over and place in a pan so that 
they do not touch; let rise. Hop yeast will bring them 
up in five hours. They should then bake in twelve minutes. 
— O'JSTeiPs Beceipt. 

N.B. — If you wish these rolls for tea or for the next 
morning's breakfast, set them in the refrigerator. They 
are perfectly delicious when treated in this way. 

210 Galettes. 

One pound of flour one half-ounce German compressed

light, add the remaining half-pound of flour, the butter and 
the eggs. Beat well and set to rise again. When light, 
form into round cakes, handling the dough as lightly as 
possible. Set to rise again, and then bake fifteen minutes in 
a hot oven. Beat a dessert-spoonful of sugar with one egg. 
When the galettes are baked, and still very hot, brush them 
over with this mixture. These are the most delicious tea 
cakes imaginable. To be eaten hot, or when cold to be 
split and toasted. — From 3frk\ Welc/i's Book and Na- 
tional Training School of Cookery. 

211 Rusk. 

Two cupfuls of sugar, one of butter, two of milk, one 
of yeast, throe eggs; rub the butter, sugar and eggs 
together; add the milk and yeast and flour enough to 
make a thick batter; let this stand in a warm place until 
liglit, and then add flour enough to make as thick as for 
biscuits; shape and put in a pan in which they are to be 
baked, and let them stand two or three hours. Bake about 
forty minutes in a moderate oven. — Miss Parloa. 

N.B. — We prefer less sugar, and when within ten min- 
utes of being done, we wash them over with an egg, into 
which a dessertspoonful of sugar has been beaten. They 
are best eaten cold.

in a moderate oven. It is always best to set the sponge 
at night, then it is ready to bake the following forenoon. 
If the rusks are wanted warm for tea, the sponge must, of 
course, be set early in the morning.

213 Baking Powder Biscuit. 

One quart of flour, one heaping tablespoonful of butter, 
(or lard), one salt spoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, nearly two cupfuls of sweet milk or cold 
water — let all the ingredients be as cold as possible — sift 
the baking powder with the flour several times so that it 
will be evenly distributed, rub in the shortening as ex- 
peditiously as possible, then quickly add the milk or water. 
These and all biscuits raised with baking powder should 
be mixed just as soft as it is possible to handle them. 
Roll from half to three-quarters of an inch thick and bake 
at once in a quick oven. Success depends largely on speed 
and the oven — 3Irs. Welc/i's Cook Book. 

N. B. by the editor — We vary these biscuits by doubling 
the quantity of butter, rolling them thinner, pricking them 
with a fork and when nearly baked washing them over 
with milk. Soda and cream of tartar biscuits can be made 
as above by using one teaspoonful of soda and two of 
cream of tartar sifted through the flour. 

214 Sally Lunn (Yeast). 

One pint of milk, three eggs beaten separately, one 
tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, and three

for tea. When light stir down and pour into dripping- 
pans, and let Sally take another rise. Bake from three- 
quarters to one hour. 

215 Sally Lunn, (Soda and Cream of Tartar.) 

One quart of flour, one pint of sweet milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, two eggs, one cup of butter. Sift into 
and through the flour two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, 
add the mixed butter and sugar, and last, one teaspoonful 
of soda dissolved in the milk. Bake twenty minutes in a 
quick oven either in cups or shallow baking-pans. 



MUFFINS. 



Muffins are a very old-fashioned breakfast cake that has 
fallen from its first estate by the average cook baking it 
in an oven. Muffins should always be baked on a griddle 
in rings, and the batter should be thick enough to drop, 
not pour or string, from the spoon. Fill each ring two- 
thirds full; the batter will then rise to the top of the ring. 
You will see the bubbles form and stiffen into holes ; the 
cake is then ready to slip your cake-turner under and turn 
ring and all. As it bakes stiff, slip the rings off and let 
theui finish. A muffin should always be torn open. 

216 Water, or English Muffin^. 

Into a quart of lukewarm water, in which three potatoes 
have been boiled and mashed, stir half a teacup of good 
hop or potato yeast, a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoonful of 
butter, and three pints of unsifted flour. This will, with 
ordinary flour, make a batter that will drop, not pour from 



88 MUFFINS. 

the spoon. Set it in a warm place to rise; it will take 
from five to eight hours. Set over night for breakfast, 
and after breakfast for tea. Grease your muffin rings, put 
a tablespoonf ul of the batter in each ring and bake, turn- 
ing as they require it. A griddle bakes nicer muffins than 
an oven. 

217 Muffins. 

One quart of sweet milk, three pints of flour, two eggs, 
a piece of butter the size of an egg, a little salt, one-half of

muffin rings on a pan, and set it to rise till morning ; bake 
half an hour, or on a griddle, turning to bake both top and 
bottom. 

221 Rice Muffins. 

Two cups of milk, four tablespoonfuls of yeast, one 
tablespoonful of white sugar, two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter, nearly a cup of well-boiled I'ice, four cups of fiour,^

quarter teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water, added 
just before baking. Beat the ingredients well together,, 
set to rise for six hours or until very light; put into muffin 
rings, let it stand fifteen minutes, and bake quickly; eat 
hot. 

222 Potato Short-Cake. 

Take six nicely mashed potatoes, add to this one pint of 
warm milk, a tablespoonful of lard, a teaspoonful of salt^ 
and a quart of sifted flour. Let this be raised with a small 
quantity of compressed yeast or a portion of Twin Brothers'' 
yeast cake, or a half cup of home-made. When ready to 
make up, which will be in about two hours, knead up ta 
the consistency of biscuits, roll out to fill your pan, and 
score in diamonds; stand in a warm place till tea time. 
Will bake in fifteen minutes in a quick oven. 

223 Potato Cakes. 

Two pounds of mashed potatoes (one pound is a scant 
pint bowl), two tablespoonfuls of butter, a little salt, two 
pounds of flour; stir in milk enough to make a thick bat- 
ter; add half a teacup of hop yeast or quarter of a cake

-of compressed yeast; set it before the fire to rise; when 
light, bake it in a large dripping-pan like a sally lunu or in 
gem-pans, the size of a muffin. 

224 Stirred Bread. 

One pound of flour, one teaspoonful salt, one tablespoon- 
fulof yeast; mix with one cup of milk and stir thoroughly, 
and set to rise. It will take about three hours to be light. 
When light stir in one eg(^, beaten light, and one teaspoon- 
ful powdered sugar, put in the pans, let rise and then bake. 
One egg is really enough for two pounds of flour. 

:225 English Crumpets. 

One quart of lukewarm milk, half a cake of compressed 
yeast or Twin Brothers' yeast, a large quart of flour, an 
even teaspoonful of salt ; make it into a batter as for 
muffins. When well risen stir into it a scant cupful of 
melted butter and let it rise a second time. Bake on a hot 
griddle in rings, double the size of muffin rings, very lightly 
on both sides. They will be thinner than muffins and can- 
not be split open. Are the better for being baked in the 
morning, and toasted and buttered for tea. Send in on hot 
plates, serving them quickly and hot. They are a delight- 
ful change sometimes.

WAFFLES. 

229 Good Ann's Eeceipt for WafSes. 

A pint bowl of sour cream or buttermilk (I have known 
her in town to use store milk with about three ounces of 
butter in it, though, of course, the results were not quite 
the same), a pint bowl heaped with sifted flour, three eggs 
and a teaspoonful of soda, stirred well in a tablespoonful 
of hot wate^ and then into the cream, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. To be baked in an iron at just the right shade 
of heat (be sure and not have it too hot to start with); but- 
ter well and eat with powdered sugar, or sugar and cinna- 
mon. 

230 Yeast Waffles. 

Three pints of milk, one heaping tablespoonful of but- 
ter; put them into a pan on the stove until the butter 
melts. Add the yolks of five eggs well beaten, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one and one-half tablespoonfuls of yeast, 



92 GRIDDLB CAKES.

of baking powder) sifted through it just before bakingj 
stir in the whites of the three eggs beaten to a stiff froth. 



GRIDDLE CAKES. 



232 Eice Crriddle Cakes. 

Can be made with above batter by adding from a half 
to three-quarters of a cupful of milk. 

233 Three Receipts for Buckwheat Cakes. 

1st. One pint of buckwheat ; half-pint of sifted corn 
meal; two level teaspoonfuls of salt; four tablespoonfuls 
of yeast; one and-a-half pints of lukewarm water (or one 
pint water and one cup of milk); beat well and set to rise 
over night. 

2d. One pint cup of very fine oatmeal, set to soak in 
the morning with one quart of water, into which two table- 
spoonfuls of yeast have been stirred; at night add one 
quart of buckwheat meal and one quart of water, three 
teaspoonfuls of salt; beat well and let vise till morning. 



GRIDDLE CAKES. 93 

3d. One pint of buckwheat flour; three tablespoonfuls 
of yeast; one quart of lukewarm water. Stir well and let 
rise till morning. 

If you use "a generator," and your cakes sour, add just 
before baking a half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a 
quarter of a teacup of boiling water. 

234 Dessert Pancakes. 

One quart of milk, six eggs, a saltspoonful of salt, flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Fry brown in a spider, 
using an equal quantity of butter and lard. The cakes 
must be turned with great care; place one cake on the plate, 
and spread upon it a little butter, sifted fine; fine sugar 
and cinnamon or nutmeg over this; then another cake on 
top, and repeat until you have three or four; cut in seg- 
ments like jelly cake. 

235 Pennsylvania Plarnel Cakes. 

The yolks of five eggs well beaten, one quart of milk 
slightly warm, a little salt and flour enough to make a bat- 
ter, add one cup of yeast. Keep warm and let rise seven 
or eight hours; just before baking add two tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter and the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
froth. Bake on a griddle. 

236 Corn Batter Cakes. 

One pint of corn-meal, a small teaspoonful of salt and 
one of soda. Pour on enough boiling water to make it 
like mush; let it stand a little to cool, then take four eggs, 
stir the yolks with the meal, a handful of flour (three- 
quarters of a cupful), two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, 
stir in as much milk or water as will make the batter suit- 
able to bake on a griddle; whites last. 



94 GRIDDLE CAKES. 

237 Pancakes of Eice. 

Boil half a pound of rice to a jelly in a small quantity 
of water; when cool, mix with it a pint of cream, eight 
eggs, a pinch of salt, eight ounces of melted butter, and 
flour enough to stiffen or bind these rich ingredients; bake 
on a griddle with as little lard as possible. 

Mrs. Gorton Arnold, 

238 Pancakes. 

Add enough flour to one quart of sour milk to make a- 
rather thick batter. Let it stand over night and in the 
morning add two well beaten eggs, salt, and half a tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in one-half cupful of warm 
water. Bake immediately. 

239 Pancakes with Bread Crumbs. 

To two cupfuls of bread crumbs soaked in milk, add one 
cupful of flour or corn-meal, two eggs, and milk enough to 
make a thin batter. If the milk is sweet add a teaspoon- 
ful of yeast powder; if sour, half a teaspoonful of soda^ 
dissolved in a tablespoonful of warm water. Bake on a 
griddle and serve a griddle full at a time. 

240 Wheaten Scones. (Scotch). 

Take from your bread dough, when light in the morn- 
ing before it has been kneaded, bits of dough the size of 
your fist; roll each one out thin (less than half an inch in 
thickness and the size of a breakfast plate in circumfer- 
ence), lay it on a hot but dry griddle — no grease whatever 
must be used; let it bake on one side, then turn and bake 
on the other; have a napkin warmed and lay the scone in 
it, [covering, while a second scone is baking; when you 
have three baked fold your napkin close over them and 
send to table piping hot. Tear them open and butter. 
They are very nice. 



MUSH, OATMEAL, BICE, 96^ 



MUSH, OATMEAL, RICE. 



241 How to Make Corn-Meal Mush. 

Very few people know how to make this dish as it should 
be. The ingredients for a dish of mush are water, salt 
and corn-meal. The water should be soft, and the salt 
fine, and the meal of the first quality; yellow meal gives 
the best color, but white meal is more easily cooked. The 
water should be boiling hot at the commencement, middle 
and end of the operation. The meal should be added very 
slowly, so as to prevent any lumps being formed, the cook 
stirring all the time, and should never be in such quantities 
as would bring down the temperature of the water below 
the boiling point. Herein lies the secret of making good 
mush. Mush should be thoroughly cooked. Proportions:. 
To three pints of water, one pint of corn-meal, and. one- 
teaspoonful of salt. Cook one hour, and stir often. 

242 Cracked Wheat. 

Cracked wheat is very nice cooked just like oat-meal.. 

243 Boiled Eice. 

To one-half pound of rice use about five pints of water,. 
Let it simmer about twenty minutes. Handle carefully, 
not to break the kernels. 

244 Cooking Oat-Meal. 

Oal-meal is not usually liked, because its preparation is 
not properly understood. It requires very long and steady 
cooking. Take one teacup of oat-meal to five of water. 



96 MACARONI. 

If your breakfast is early it does not hurt it to begin the 
night before by mixing the oat-meal smooth in cold water, 
then pour into boiling water, adding a little salt to season. 
Keep the water in the double boiler at a boiling point for 
two hours, and just before it is thoroughly cooked add a 
little milk to whiten and improve the flavor. Stir thor- 
oughly at intervals. 

245 Mrs. DeLand's Oat-Meal Porridge. 

One coffee-cup of oat-meal, one pint of hot water. Put 
on the stove over night and cook in a double boiler; add 
half a pint of boiling water in the morning and cook one 
hour. If desired thinner, add more boiling water till 
adapted to wish or taste. 



MACARONI. 



246 Macaroni. 

Throw the required quantity into salted boiling water, 
boil about twenty minutes, drain in a colander; then put 
in a porcelain lined kettle with half a teacup of butter (for 
seven or eight persons); toss about in the butter till it is 
all absorbed. Have a small dish of grated cheese for each 
to use at pleasure. S. E. Wethbrelle, per Mrs. L. 

247 Macaroni. 

One-quarter of a pound of macaroni boiled in beef stock 
or milk and water, with a little salt,twenty or thirty minutes. 
AVhen done, drain off the water and keep the saucepan 
covered; roll two tablespoonfuls of butter in two of flour; 
boil half a pint of cream, and one pint of milk, to which 



MACAKONI. 91 

add the butter and flour and boil until it thickens. Stirring 
all the time, butter a dish, and put in a first layer of maca- 
roni; then grate over this an ounce of parmesan or com- 
mon cheese, and pour a portion of the sauce. Repeat this 
four times, which will fill your dish (use a quarter of a 
pound of cheese in all). Bake ten minutes. This is a very 
fine Hartford receipt, but in our family we prefer one 
quarter the cheese, 

248 Macaroni de la Solferino. 

To half a pound of macaroni boiled in water and well 
drained, add half an onion, a slice of raw ham chopped tine 
and then browned. Moisten the mixture with tomato 
sauce, or a layer of fried tomatoes; just before serving 
sprinkle the whole with grated cheese, and serve very hot. 

249 Macaroni. 

Scald a quarter of a pound of macaroni half an hour, in 
just enough water to cover it. Then put it in a buttered 
dish, add salt, butter and pepper. Grate over it about an 
ounce of cheese. Stir two eggs into one cup of milk, and 
pour over. Bake twenty minutes. 

The appearance of macaroni is improved by laying strips 
of puff-paste cut with a paste jigger over the top, crossing 
them as you would for a tart. 

Macaroni as a separate course, a la fourchette — in jjlace 
of, or ajter, soup. Boil it as usual, and when sent to table 
pour over it a sauce made of cream or milk, with a little 
butter, flour, salt and cheese. It must not be entirely cov- 
ered with the sauce. — Mrs. Endicott, per Mrs. L. 



98 EGGS. 



EGGS. 

250 Boiled Eggs. 

When the water is at a keen boil, lift the pot from the 
fire, and put the eggs in, and let them stay exactly four 
minutes. Serve pinned up in a warm napkin. 

Another method is to keep the eggs in water at a keen 
"boil for exactly two minutes and three-quarters. 

A third and better method is to put your eggs in hot 
water and let them scald but not boil for ten minutes. 

251 Poached Eggs. 

Salt the water well, and when just ready to boil drop 
in the egg, which has been broken carefully into a saucer, 
and let stand till done, which can be seen by the white 
being cooked. Serve on buttered toast. Dust a litte salt 
and pepper on the top. 

252 Scrambled Eggs. 

Have your spider hot and buttered as soon as you are 
ready vsrith six eggs broken into a dish, to which you add 
a little salt, a " shake " of pepper, a bit of butter the 
size of a nutmeg, and half a cup of rich, sweet 
milk. Beat them up a little, just enough to break 
up the eggs, then pour into the buttered spider. Scrape 
your spoon back and forth to prevent their adhering 
to the bottom of the spider. Do not cook too dry; a 
few minutes will cook them. This is nice for breakfast or 
lunch. Take them up while they are quite soft, as they 
harden a little after removal from the pan. 



EGGS. 99 

253 Egg Omelet (Very Nice). 

Five well-beaten eggs, one-and-a-half cups of milk, three 
tablespoonfuls of flour; mix the flour in a little of the milk, 
and rub smooth, then add milk and flour to eggs, and beat 
well together; grease well with lard a frying-pan; put in, 
when not very hot, a large kitchenspoonful, it will cover 
about half; fold with a knife when light brown, and roll up 
as it browns. 

254 Ham Omelet. 

One-half pint of milk, two teaspoon fuls of flour, three 
teaspoonf uls of cracker crumbs, six eggs well beaten. Put 
thinly and evenly over the griddle; then iramediatelyscatter 
over it finely minced ham. Double it one-third, then fold 
again. 

255 Omelet. 

Set a smooth frying-pan on the fire to heat; break five 
eggs into a bowl; put butter the size of an egg into a heated 
pan; give twelve strong beats to your eggs, and when the 
butter begins to boil, pour in the eggs. Draw up the eggs 
from the bottom of the pan, but do not stir, simply shake 
the pan. When the bottom is well done and the top a 
little soft, fold over and put on a platter. Serve immedi- 
ately. This may be varied by the addition of three table- 
spoonfuls of milk. 

256 Baked Eggs. 

Six eggs, four tablespoonfuls good gravy, veal, beef or 
poultry; the latter is particularly nice; one handful of 
bread crumbs, six rounds of buttered toast or fried bread. 

Put the gravy into a shallow baking-dish, break the eggs 
into this, pepper and salt them, and strew the bread crumbs 



100 EGGS. 

over them. Bake for five minutes in a quick oven. Take 
up the eggs carefully, one by one, and lay upon the toast, 
which must be arranged on a hot, flat dish. Add a little 
cream, and if you like, some very finely chopped parsley 
and onion to the gravy left in the baking-dish, and turn it 
into a saucepan. Boil up once quickly, and pour over the 
eggs- 

257 Eggs Sur le Plat. 

Six eggs, one tablespoonful of butter or nice dripping, 
pepper and salt to taste. Melt the butter on a stone china 
or tin plate, or shallow baking-dish. Break the eggs care- 
fully into this, dust lightly with pepper and salt; lay a bit 
of butter on each, and put into a moderate oven until the 
whites are well set. Serve in the dish in which they were 
baked. 

25S Egg Vermicelli. 

Boil three eggs twelve minutes. Separate yolks and 
whites; keep the former warm ^vhile chopping the whites 
fine, pepper and salt to taste (adding celery salt or celery 
p'owder), one heaping teaspoonful of flour, three table- 
spoonfuls of cream, butter the size of a walnut; boil the 
cream and butter, then add the whites of eggs. When 
thickened spread on toast or puff paste shells, and rub the 
yolks through a coarse sieve or strainer over the top. —

SALADS. 101 



SALADS. 

259 Chicken Salad 

Is eminently an American dish, and Detroit is quite 
celebrated for its delicious chicken salads. Our entertain- 
ments may not be as showy as in other western cities, but 
our caterers understand that the stale salads of a previous 
party can never be freshened. Mrs. Henderson makes a 
suggestion which we have found works very nicely, that she 
calls " marinating the chicken?'' Sprinkle upon the chicken 
a mixture in the proportion of three tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar to one of oil and one (level) of salt, a pinch — the small- 
est pinch — of cayenne, about what would lie on the point of 
a penknife, and a teaspoonful of mixed mustard. Let the 
chicken stand in this mixture an hour or two; drain off 
what may be in the bottom of the bowl; ten or twenty 
minutes before serving pour over a mild mayonnaise. Lit- 
tle strips of anchovy rolled up are used with pickles, hard 
boiled eggs, and lettuce-heads, or tender yellow celery tops 
to garnish. 

"We give as minute directions as possible for the various 
methods and tastes in mixing the dressing. 

An eight-pound turkey, rubbed with a fresh lemon, and 
boiled in well-salted water (having two tablespoonfuls of 
raw rice in it), is used and preferred by many to a pair of 
chickens. The flavor is radically different, but quite 
delightful. Every one of the receipts given will make a 
nice salad. The colder your salad is the crisper and 
fresher it will taste, and the thicker and better will be 
your dressing. 



102 SALADS. 

260 Lobster Salad. 

Use the "Mayonnaise Sauce," only adding to it two or 
three teaspoonfuls of anchovy sauce and a saltspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce; celery or lettuce in less proportions 
than for chicken salad. Pickeled walnuts or olives make 
a nice garnish for this salad. 

261 Shrimp Salad. 

Take canned shrimps and use the dressing recommended, 
for lobster salad. Put fresh lettuce in the salad dish, then 
the shrimps, and then pour over all the dressing. 

262 Egg Salad. 

Boil six eggs hard; chop the whites fine, and rub the 
yolks smooth. Take a cupful of finely chopped ham. Mix 
the whole carefully; sprinkle in a little salt, pepper and 
chopped celery, or celery salt; cover the whole with May- 
onnaise dressing. Garnish with French peas, slices of 
lemon and hard-boiled egg. The whole can be served on 
nice leaves of lettuce if you have it. 



263 Mrs. Henry Smith's Chicken Salad Dressing. 

For the white meat of two chickens, take a coffee-cup of 
very strong vinegar; the yolks of five eggs, well beaten; 
butter the size of an egg; one tablespoonful of made mus- 
tard (thick); two teaspoonfuls of salt, a little white pep- 
per. Cook the dressing over hot water, as you would a 
custard, until thick, stirring constantly; add the beaten 



SALADS. 103 

whites. Have twice as much celery as chicken, and cut 
both up instead of chopping. Just before serving mix the 
meat and celery, then add to the dressing a cup of very 
rich sweet cream; beat well and pour over the chicken 
and celery, and stir it for a moment. N. B. — We double 
the mustard in this recipe. 

264 Salad Dressing, 

Four eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately, eight 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, six tablespoonfuls of cream, 
one tablespoouful of corn starch, one teaspoonful of mus- 
tard, one teaspoonful salt, one teaspoonful pepper, two 
tablespoonfuls oil. Mix all the ingredients together except 
the oil and whites of the eggs; put on the fire 'and stir 
until it thickens; add the oil and beaten whites of the eggs 
the last thing and when very cold. N. B. — We do not 
like the whites of the eggs in this dressing, and put in four 
times as much mustard. 

265 Miss Smith's Cream Dressing. 

Five eggs, beaten separately; two tablespoonfuls of 
mixed mustard; butter the size of an egg; two teaspoon- 
f uls of salt ; one saltspoonf ul of red pepper; three tablespoon- 
fuls of the finest table oil; one pint of thick cream. Scald 
the cream, stir in the yolks, and continue to stir until it 
begins to thicken; then add the mustard, salt, etc., and 
two or three tablespoonfuls of very strong vinegar; then 
let it cool, and add the whipped froth of the eggs. Beat 
all thoroughly together. Do not pour over the chicken 
and celery until just before using. N. B. — We double the 
mustard and double the oil, the latter we stir in when all 
is cold. 



104 SALADS. 

266 Mayonnaise Sauce. 

Put the uncooked yolk of an egg into a cold bowl; beat 
it well with a silver fork; then add two saltspoonfuls of 
salt, and one saltspoonful of mustard powder; work them 
well a minute before adding the oil; then mix in a little 
good oil, which must be poured in very slowly (a few drops 
at a time) at first, alternated occasionally with a few drops 
of vinegar. In proportion as the oil is used, the sauce 
should gain consistency. When it begins to have the 
appearance of jelly, alternate a few drops of lemon juice 
with the oil. When the egg has absorbed a gill of oil, 
finish the sauce by adding a very little pinch of cayenne 
pepper, and one and-a-half teasjioonfuls of good vinegar; 
taste it to see if there is sufficient of salt, mustard, cayenne 
and vinegai-. If not, add more very carefully. These 
proportions will suit most tastes; yet some like more mus- 
tard and more oil. Be cautious not to use too much cay- 
enne. By beating the egg a moment before adding the oil, 
there is little danger of the sauce curdling; yet if by add- 
ing too much at first, it should possibly curdle, immediately 
interrupt the operation; put the yolks of one or two eggs 
on another plate; beat them well, and add the curdled 
mayonnaise by degrees, and finish by adding more oil, 
lemon-juice, vinegar, salt and cayenne, according to taste. 
If lemons are not at hand, may use vinegar instead. 

267 Dressing for Salad. 

FOR TWO CHICKENS AND TWELVE HEADS OF CELERY. 

Four eggs beaten light, yolks and whites together; two 
tablespoonfuls of mixed mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of black pepper, or one-third of a teaspoon 
of red pepper, one tablespoonful of butter, and nearly one 



SALADS. 105- 

teaciipful of sharp vinegar. Float the pan containing the 
ingredients in a pan of boiling water on the stove and stir 
until it is thick like custard. When cold pour over the 
salad, adding cold vinegar, if needed. N. B. — We add 
half a teacup of Gustier's salad oil when the dressing is 
cold. 

2G8 German Salad Dressing. 

The yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, put through a sieve,, 
the yolks of three raw eggs, one teaspoonful of salt. Beat 
well together until cream-like, then add a pint of olive oil, 
one cup of vinegar, a little pepper and a little sugar. Beat 
all well together until light, cold and creamy. Add capers, 
if used for fish dressing. 

269 Dressing for Mayonnaise. 

The yolks of four eggs, beaten light with a silver fork;, 
then add, drop by drop, a teacupful of the finest salad oil,, 
two small onions, and a small bunch of parsley, minced 
very fine; pour this over a whitefish that has been boiled 
in salted water and flavored with a lemon (juice and 
rind); remove the bones from the fish; when cold, pile into 
a shape, and as it comes to table pour over the dressing. 

270 Salad Dressing Made at Table. 

The yolk of a raw egg, one tablespoon of mixed mus- 
tard, one-fourth of a teaspoon of salt, six tablespoons of 
oil; stir the yolk, mustard and salt together with a fork

or baked potato; to these add one tablespoonful of mixed 
mustard; blend the two thoroughly, then stir in one-half 
cup of thick, sweet cream and one tablespoonful of melted 
butter, or one teacup of the purest salad oil; a little salt 
and cayenne, and, if desired, a dash of anchovy or Worces- 
tershire sauce. Last of all, add little by little, vinegar 
enough to make the whole a smooth, creamy mass, and 
pour it on the lettuce just before serving. 

•272 Salad Dressing— To Keep. 

Two teacups of sweet cream, one teacup of vinegar, two 
tablespoonfuls of corn starch, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
■one tablespoonful of mustard (dry), four 'eggs, yolks and

vinegar last, and stir till the consistency of boiled custard; 
add the whites of eggs and bottle. The sugar may be 
omitted if not to the taste of the family. 

273 Potato Salad— Good. 

Can be made a delicious and rather complicated dish, 
like " the beggars' stone soup." Take six boiled potatoes 
steaming from the pot, cut them in slices, pepper and salt 
-a little, lay over a shadow of very thinly sliced onion, a 
^prig of parsley or so cut very fine, some olives cut fine 
or left whole, as garnishes, two or three red beets sliced 
like the potatoes, some scraps of red herring or sardines, a 
•cucumber pickle or two cut into small dice, and some

heaping saltspoon or level teaspoonful of salt, one even 
teaspoonf ul of scraped onion, one tablespoonful of vinegar, 
one teaspoonful of tarragon or pepper vinegar. Beat for 
a few moments with a fork, and pour over a vegetable 
salad. 

275 Simple Potato Salad. 

Boil your potatoes, then skin and slice while hot, into a 
covered vegetable dish; have all ready a dressing. One- 
third of a teacup of boiling water, one-third or more of 
vinegai', and a little more oil than vinegar; slice a small 
onion thin, and lay between the layers of potato; when the 
dish is full pour the dressing over it; cover, and put away 
to cool; just before serving, stir it with a salad fork or 
spoon. Mix the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper well together, 
and then add the hot watei*. 

27ft Fresh Tomatoes 

Make a delightful salad sliced and having a tablespoonful 
of vinegar, a teaspoonful of oil, a saltspoonful of mustard, 
and a saltspoonful of salt beaten together and poured over 
them. Lobster served on tomatoes and covered with a 
mayonnaise dressing is a charming combination. 

277 Tomato Mayonnaise 

Is also nice, using the mayonnaise sauce very cold, and 
having the tomatoes very cold before the one is poured 
over the other.

278 Pastry. 

One pound and a quarter of flour, one pound of butter, 
or one-half butter and one-half lard, and if necessary a salt- 
spoon of salt, all cut together, sufficient ice cold water (less 
than a teacupful) to mix with; no more flour. Put upon 
the molding-board, roll out and cut in strips, put one upon 
another, then cut off in squares, roll out and put upon 
plates; bake at once in a quick oven, 

279 Plain, but &ood Family Pie-Crust. 

One pound of flour, half a pound butter; mix thoroughly 
with a knife or spoon. Pour in very cold ice water, just 
enough to form a dough for rolling out; flour the board 
and rolling-pin, using a knife to handle the dough (the 
warmth of the hand makes it heavy); roll out the size of 
one plate at a time, so as to work it as little as possible. 
Bake in a quick oven. 

2 SO Prof. Blot's Eeoeipt for Pie-Crust. 

One pound of flour, wet with water; then stir in one 
pound of butter, cut in small pieces, and roll out. 

281 Plain Pie-Crust for Two Pies.

282 A Celebrated Puff Paste. 

One pound of flour, one pound of butter, one egg. Mix 
the flour with a lump of butter the size of an egg, and the 
one egg to a very stiff paste, adding as little as possible of 
ice-cold water. Knead it well for a few minutes, perhaps 
ten or fifteen, divide the butter into six equal parts, squeeze 
any buttermilk out that may stand in the butter, roll the 
paste out thin, and put on one spreading of little bits of 
butter; dredge with flour; fold and roll out again; repeat 
this five more times, dredging, folding and rolling each 
time. Now place it on the ice, or in a very cold place, 
from one to four hours. 

283 Tart Crust. 

The white of one egg beaten to a stiff froth, one table- 
spoon white sugar, one cup of butter or lard, a little salt, 
five tablespoons of ice-water, three cups of sifted flour; 
I'oll quite thin for tarts; cut out with a cooky cutter — a 
scalloped one will look best; take an open-top thimble, 
make five holes in one, lay this on top of a whole one, 
which makes one tart; proceed with all the dough in the 
same way; bake lightly, when done split open the tart and 
lay a slice of nice jelly between the layers; squeeze up the 
jelly through the holes; place them on the table on a plate 
and you have a splendid-looking dish for the tea table, and 
something that will keep two months. Do not put your 
jelly in till you wish them for the table. 

284: Rich Mince Pie. 

Three pounds of beef, one fresh beef's tongue, four (or 
six) pounds of suet, three and-a-half pounds ot raisins, 
three pounds of currants, three-quarters of a pound of cit-

two ounces of cloves, a nutmeg, one teacupful of the Mace 
compound, one-and-a-fourth ounces of salt, half an ounce 
of pepper, one gallon and-a-half of sweet cider. When 
mixed, put into a kettle and scald, stirring it all the time. 
Pat it hot into Hero or Mason jars — two quarts or gallon 
jars — and the longer you keep it the nicer it will be. When 
making up your pies you can add a teacup of finely chopped 
apples for each pie. 

285 Mince Pie. 

Seven pounds of meat, six pounds of suet, four pounds 
of suo-ai", one gallon and-a-half of boiled cider, seven 
pounds of currants, seven pounds of seeded raisins, four- 
teen pounds of chopped apples. Boil together cider, 
apples and sugar, and when hot pour over the other ingre- 
dients; add one teacup of Mace compound, nutmeg and 
cinnamon to taste. If citron is liked, put in slices just 
before baking; the vinegar from pickled peaches is a nice 
addition — to this quantity use one pint. 

286 Plain Mince Meat. 

One pint bowl of meat and one of suet, chopped fine; 
two bowls of apples; one of boiled cider; one and one-half 
cups of molasses, one bowl of sugar, one teaspoon of cloves, 
two of cinnamon, two of allspice and one nutmeg. Let the 
mixture come to a boil. 

287 Summer Mince Pies. 

We do not recommend this, preferring fruit pies in 
summer, but the recipe is highly recommended. Two cups 
of dried apples soaked over night and chopped fine in the 
morning; four eggs boiled hard and chopped fine; one

tablespoonfnl of butter, one cup of raisins, one cup of cur- 
rants, a little salt, one cup of sugar, half a lemon, rind and 
juice, one cup of molasses; put in tbe water the applet 
soaked in; all kinds of spice; bake in a slow oven. 

288 Mock Mince Meat. 

This recipe is for "a last shift" for persons who have 
not " store privileges." It is not bad, but to our taste, not 
good. Two eggs, eight butter crackers rolled, one coffee- 
cup of raisins, one-half coffee-cup of vinegar, one coffee-cup 
of molasses, one of sugar, one of water, one-half of butter; 
spices to suit the taste. 

289 Lemon Pie, No. 1.— Very Pine. 

Grate the rind and squeeze the juice of two lemons; beat 
the yolks of three eggs with eight tablespoonfuls of granu- 
lated sugar, half a cup of water and two even tablespoon- 
fuls of flour; stir the flour into the well-beaten yolks and 
sugar, then add water, juice and rind; bake with an under 
crust, have ready when it comes from the oven, the whites,, 
beaten to a stiff froth, with four tablespoonfuls of pulver- 
ized sugar; spread over the pie, set in oven, and brown a& 
quickly as possible, to avoid its being leathery. 

I should like to add, for the benefit of many housekeep- 
ers who do not know, that a meringue should always be 
put on while the pudding or pie is hot, and browned as 
quickly as possible; if cold, it is apt to go back and taste 
of raw egg. — Mbs. D, A. L, 

290 Lemon Pie.— No. 2. 

One cup of white sugar, one tablespoonfnl of corn starchy 
one lemon, grate off the outside, and squeeze out the juice, 
two eggs. Wet the corn-starch with cold water, then fill

the teacup with boiling water, a dessertspoonful of butter. 
When a little cold add the lemon and egg. Bake in a 
bottom crust with a meringue at the top. 

291 Lsmon Pie that will Keep a Long Time, No. 1. 

One pound of sugar, half a pound of butter, eight eggs, 
the rind of two lemons, the juice of one; beat well and 
bake with an under crust in an oven not too hot, as it needs 
thorough baking, and must 7iot have a soft or custard look 
when done. This recipe will make two pies, which, if not 
eaten fresh, will be equally good a week after with a fresh 
meringue and browned in the oven, and is recommended 
by a first-rate housekeeper. 

• 

292 A Substitute for Corn Starch. 

Grate a large cooked potato, or its equivalent in small 
ones, as a substitute for corn-stai'ch in a- lemon pie, or 
-sprinkle flour over it enough to thicken it a little. Some 
use raw potatoes, but I prefer cooked. Try it, if you have 
a good recipe; you will think your pies are delicious. 

293 Lemon Pie, No. 3. 

Take the juice and rind of one lemon, one cup of sugar, 
the yolks of three eggs, one teaspoonful of butter and one 
cup of milk; bake in a rich paste; beat the whites of three 
eggs to a stiff froth, with two tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar and spread over the top, return to the oven and 
brown slightly. If the pie is desired stiff, use a table- 
spoonful of grated j^otato. 

294 Apple Lemon Pie. 

One teacup of stewed apples, two eggs, one cup of 
sugar, lemon to suit taste. Use no upper crust. 



PIES. 1 13 

295 Lemon Pie. 

One large apple chopped fine, one lemon, chop the inside 
fine, just take oflF the thick white part, grate the rind first ; 
one egg, one cup sugar, butter the size of a walnut. Bake 
with two crusts nearly an hour, or with a meringue and 
one crust. Delicious.

One teacup of sugar, one-half cup of butter, three eggs, 
one grated cocoanut, one quart of scalded milk poured 
on the cocoanut, underlined with pastry. 

297 Cocoannt Pie. 

One cup of dessicated cocoanut soaked in one quart of 
milk, two powdered crackers or two tablespoonfuls of corn- 
starch, three eggs, a little butter and salt, add one cupful 
of sugar and grated rind of lemon. Very rich. 

298 Orange Pie. 

Rub the yellow of two oranges with lumps of sugar, add 
juice of three, and one cup of white sugar, one finely rolled 
and sifted cracker, a teaspoonful of butter, four e2;gii, one 
cup of sweet milk. Line pudding dish with paste, and 
bake until fix-m; nice either hot or cold. With or without 
a meringue. 

299 Orange Pie. 

Three oranges peeled with a knife, and sliced in rounds 
into a plate lined with paste. Sprinkle well (if sour) 
with sugar, and add two tablespoonfuls of water. If the 
oranges are sweet, add the juice of half a lemon. Cover 
with paste and bake. This is as nice as a peach pie. In early 
spring we have sometimes found the oranges turn bitter 
when cooked, possibly because they have been frosted.

300 Pio Plant or Hhubard Pie. 

Peel a bunch of pie plant, put it into your chopping- 
bowl and chop into pieces the size of your little finger 
nail; grate the rind and squeeze the juice of a lemon over 
this, add sugar to taste; put this into a pie dish lined with 
paste, lay in a bit of butter, and cut strips of paste and 
lay them across the top, and bake. Or pour the chopped 
plant into a porcelain-lined basin with the sugar and give 
it a good scald. Bake with under and upper crust. 

301 Strawterry Pie. 

Make a nice puff paste, with which line a baking plate; 
half bake it in a quick oven. Have ready sugared straw- 
berries to fill the plate, and the white of an egg beaten and 
sweetened as a meringue with which to cover the berries. 
Return to the oven long enough to brown slightly. 

302 Pumpkin Pie. 

Stir into a generous quart of boiling milk, one pint of 
well stewed and strained pumpkin; let it scald a moment, 
then add one and-one-half cupfuls of sugar, three eggs, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, one even tablespoon ful 
of ground ginger and one of ground cinnamon, a little 
nutmeg, and a tablespoonful of molasses. Bake in pie 
plates lined with good paste. Should be at least an inch 
thick. We have friends who prefer to use four eggs; this 
will make the pies a little stiffer. 

Squash Pie may be made by the above receipt, but use 
less than a'pint of squash, as it is dryer and of a finer grain 
than pumpkin.

303 Pumpkin or Squash Pie.

and rubbed through a colander; then stir it into two quarts 
of boiling milk (or one quart of boiling milk, afterwards 
adding one quart of cream unboiled); let scald a moment

or nine eggs, as suits your taste. The five makes a softer 
and more quaking pie; the latter a stiff pfe. Spice with 
one heaping teaspoonful each of ginger, cinnamon and nut- 
meg, two cupfuls of sugar and two tablespoon fuls of mo- 
lasses. Bake with one crust only; the pie an inches or an 
inch-and-a-half thick, 

304 Crw'am Pie— Unsurpassed. 

One pint of rich cream, one scant teacup of sugar, the- 
whites of four eggs whipped to a stiff froth; beat all to- 
gether and pour into a pie-plate lined with paste. Bake as 
you would custard pie and eat when very cold, 

305 Peach Pie. 

Line with paste a deep pie or soup plate, then skin the 
peaches (or if they are fair-skinned and tender, rub off with 
a crash towel the downy coat), and lay on the plate as 
many as will make one layer; cover with white sugar and 
lay on the top paste. Bake until the fruit is done. If the 
crust is likely to be overdone, leave open the oven door. 
Some prefer to have no under crust, in which case the 
upper crust should be somewhat thicker. To be eaten 
cold, and is delicious with the addition of cream. 

306 Apple Custard Pie. 

One pint of good stewed apples, quarter of a pound of 
butter, half a pint of cream, three eggs, beaten light. 
Sugar and flavoring to the taste. Bake on an under crust-

throw a few cloves or mace. In this syrup scald a few 
apples at a time, taking them out and putting more in till 
all are slightly cooked; set aside to cool, then pour into

butter about over the flour; dredge again, and cover with 
paste and bake.

Two cups of sugar, half a cup of butter, one cup of milk 
(if sour, stir in one teaspoonful of saleratus), add one egg; 
beat the butter and sugar together, then break in the egg 
and beat it light; then add the milk foaming, and three- 
and-a-half cups of flour (if the milk is sweet, use three 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder in the flour instead of sale- 
ratus). Bake in four tin plates, in a quick oven; then have 
ready some nicely stewed apples, sweetened and flavored 
with nutmeg or lemon, or other fruit like raspberry jam; 
spread a thick layer on one of the cakes and place another

very good for a dessert. 

In an emergency, they may be made after the dinner is 
served if the fruit is at hand, or can be spread with custard, 
as in the following receipt: Juice and rind of one lemon, 
one cup of sugar, one egg, cooked together, then spread 
between cakes; frost the top. Jelly spread between is also

PUDDINGS 



In these days, when puddings are always "steamed in a 
mold," the temperature of the water is not a matter of 
such vital importance. We confess to being old- 
fashioned enough to prefer a pudding boiled in a bag. 
Take a half a yard of nice, new " Russia Duck," or strong 
unbleached drilling, or sail cloth, sew together so as to 
form a sausage ; turn it inside out, dip it in boiling water, 
and rub it into a pan of flour, turn the bag so that the 
flour is on the inside, tie up one end tightly, and pour the 
the pudding into the other, leave room for it to swell; 
tie the other end. Put a plate in your pot, have the water 
boiling, and keep it boiling for three hours after you have 
plunged your pudding in. The flavor of a bag pudding 
is greatly superior to that of a moid. 

Baking a pudding is a more simple process, but let us 
warn our students not to bake it to death. A bread or any 
custard pudding should shake in the middle when it is 
done. A rice pudding should be lightly baked; an Indian 
meal pudding will bear much longer baking. The boiled 
lemon pudding given at No. 329 requires a mold as it is so 
delicate. 

313 Mace Compound. 

Soak half an ounce of mace eight hours in one pint of 
lemon juice, add a teacup of boiling water and scald twenty 
minutes. An excellent substitute for objectionable 
flavorings.

Roll fine a pound of brown sugar and mince three-quarters 
of a pound of beef suet. Prepare two grated nutmegs, a 
large tablespoonful of powdered cinnamon, the grated peel 
of two large lemons or oranges, and one-half pound of cut 
citron; beat ten eggs very light and stir them gradually into 
the cold milk, alternately with the suet and grated bread- 
crumbs; add by degrees the sugar, fruits and spice, with 
half a teacup of the lemon and mace, and two teaspoonfuls 
of extract of nectarine, three dozen bitter and sweet 
almonds blanched and powdered, mix the whole very well, 
then pour it into a mold or a scalded and floured pudding 
bag, and put into boiling water and boil steadily five hours, 
replenishing the pot with boiling water. 

315 English Plum Pudding "Without Eggs.

salt; cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to taste. The fruit 
should be raisins, currants, and citron cut into strips, can- 
died orange peel, and if desired, blanched almonds. Boil 
constantly for six hours, leaving room in the bag for it to 
swell. It should be boiled the day before it is wanted. 
Keep in the bag. Next day boil one hour. Eat with a 
rich sauce.

in a pan half filled with boiling water; bake for about half 
an hour, and then turn out upon a platter, and serve hot 
with a sauce made of butter and sugar beaten to a cream

water and set in a tolerably warm place to soak five or six 
hours, stirring now and then. Pack the apples in a deep 
dish, adding a cup of lukewarm water; cover closely and 
steam in a moderate oven until soft all through, turning 
them as they cook at the bottom. If the dish is more than 
a third full of liquid turn out some before you pour the 
soaked tapioca over all. Unless your apples are very 
sweet, fill the center with sugar and stick a clove in each 
just before you cover with tapioca. Then bake one hour. 
Eat warm with sweet sauce. 

332 How to Make a Cheap Apple Pudding— English. 

In the first place select two deep earthen dishes, of the 
same size and shape, that will hold two or three quarts, 
according to the family. Then fill one with nice apples, 
peeled and sliced thin. Add a teacup of cold water. Cover 
the apples with a tender pie-crust, then turn the empty dish, 
after it has been well buttered, over the one in which you 
have the pudding, and place them both in a steamer. It 
will require about two hours and a-half. Let the pudding 
be just ready for the dessert, and do not remove the upper 
dish until the minute the pudding is to be eaten. 

It is nice with sugar and butter, but with rich cream 
sweetened, it is a very delicious dessert. This pudding 
can be varied by using canned peaches or apricots instead 
of apples. 

333 Apple Pudding. 

Make a pint of sour apple sauce, sweeten it a litile, and

Take of eggs six in number when bought for a groat; 
The fruit with which Eve her husband did cozen, 
Well pared and well chopped at least half a dozen; 
Six ounces of bread — let Moll eat the crust, 
And crumble the rest as fine as the dust; 
Six ounces of sugar won't make it too sweet; 
Some salt and some nutmeg will make it complete; 
Three hours let it boil without any flutter.

be varied by spreading one cup of concentrated cocoanut 
instead of the jelly and covering this with the meringue.

FRIED CREAM, BATTER PUDDINGS, 
FRITTERS. 



387 Fried Cream (Creme Frite). 

Every one should try this recipe. It will surprise many 
to know how soft cream could be enveloped in the crust; 
it is an exceedingly good dish for a dinner course, or for 
lunch or tea. When the pudding is hard it can be rolled 
in the egg and bread-crumbs. The moment the ^^^ touches 
the hot lard it hardens, and secures the pudding, which 
softens to a creamy substance, very delicious. 

Ingredients: One pint of milk, five ounces of sugar (little 
more than half a cupful), butter the size of a hickory nut, 
yolks of three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of corn starch, and 
one tablespoonful of flour (a generous half cupful alto- 
gether), stick of cinnamon one inch long, one-half teaspoon - 
ful of vanilla. Put the cinnamon into the milk, and when 
it is just about to boil, stir in the sugar, the corn starch, 
and flour, the two latter rubbed smooth, with two or three 
tablespoonfuls of extra cold milk; stir it over the fire for 
fully two minutes, to cook well the starch and flour; take 
it from the fire, stir into it the beaten yolks of the eggs, 
and return it for a few moments to set them ; now, again 
taking it from the fire, remove the cinnamon, stir in the 
butter and vanilla, and pour it on a buttered platter until 
half an inch high. When cold and stiff, cut the pudding 
into parallelograms, about three inches long, and two inches 
wide; roll these carefully, first in sifted cracker crumbs, 
then in eggs (slightly beaten and sweetened), then again 



FRIED CREASf, BATTER PUDDINGS, FRITTERS. 141 

in the cracker crumbs. Dip these into boiling hot lard (a 
wire basket should be used if convenient), and when of 
fine color take them out and place them in the oven for 
four or five minutes to better soften the pudding. Sprinkle 
over pulverized sugar and serve immediately. 

388 White Puffs, Very Nice. 

Marion Harland says: One pint of rich milk, whites of 
four eggs, beaten stiff; one heaping cup of prepared flour 
(or teaspoonful of baking powder in ordinary flour), one 
scant cup of powdered sugar, grated peel of half a lemon, 
a little salt. Whisk the eggs and sugar to a meringue and 
add this alternately with the milk, cream or half cream 
— half milk is better, if you have it; beat until the mixture 
is very light, and bake in buttered cups or tins. Turn out, 
sift powdered sugar over them, and eat with lemon sauce, 
or sauce flavored with lemon. These are delicate in taste 
and texture, and pleasant to the eye. 

389 Cream Batter Pudding (Most Excellent).

392 French Fritters. 

One tumbler of water, a saltspoon of salt, a teaspoonf ul 
of sugar, quarter of a pound of butter. Put all together 
in a stewpan on the stove, and when well heated so that 
the butter is thoroughly melted, stir rapidly in one-half 
pound of flour; take it from the fire and break in one egg, 
blend it and break another, and then another, till five have 
been broken in; then in very hot lard and butter drop 
spoonfuls of this mixture and let boil slowly, as you do 
fritters; when they are taken out roll them in sugar and 
cinnamon, or eat with pudding sauce.

393 Fritters Made with Yeast. 

One quart of flour, three tablespoonfuls of yeast, five 
eggs, and one pint of milk; beat into a tolerably stiff bat- 
ter; stir a cupful of boiled rice into the batter a short 
time (about an hour) before boiling. A great deal of lard 
boiling hot is required for frying the fritters. Drop the 
batter in with a spoon, which must be dipped each time 
into hot water. Set the fritters at breakfast time or just

394: American Fritters. 

One cupful of milk, one and one-half ciipfuls of sifted 
flour, two eggs, one teaspoonful of sugar, one small tea- 
spoonful of baking powder; beat the eggs to a froth, then 
add milk and sugar. Lastly put in the flour with the 
baking powder stirred well through, drop them, a spoonful 
at a time, in boiling lard. Serve immediately. 

395 Orange Fritters. 

Take the above batter for American fritters; peel an 
orange, split it according to its natural divisions, as far as 
possible extract the seeds; dip each section of orange into 
the batter and boil in hot lard. 

396 Apple Fritters. 

Slice tender tart apples thin, mix in American fritters 
batter, and boil in hot lard. 

397 Arrow Root Pudding. 

One cup of milk, into which mix two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of arrow root stirred into three oups of boiling 
milk, add when nearlj^ cold; have four tablespoonfuls of 
sugar beaten into two tablespoonfuls of butter and the 
yolks of four eggs stirred into the arrow root; flavor and 
bake twenty minutes. 

398 Kissingen Pfanneknchen, very nice. 

One cup of flour, one pint of milk, one tablespoonful of 
sugar, piece of butter, the size of a walnut (a heaping tea- 
spoonful); scald the milk, butter and flour together. After 
the batter is cold stir in the yolks of eight eggs, and just 
before cooking add the whites beaten very light. Put into 
a frying or omelet pan a tablespoonful of butter; let it 



144 HOME-MADE EXTRACTS. 

boil up, pour in one-sixth of this mixture, and let it fry as 
you do an omelet, but without shaking; fold over from 
each side of the pan and double in the middle, as you do 
an omelet. In Germany they sprinkle sugar over before 
folding up. We prefer sifting the powdered sugar on 
after it is folded. Raspberry jam is served with pfanne- 
kuchen. We prefer it without. It takes a little knack to 
make and bake pfannekucheu, but this receipt is right. 



HOME-MADE EXTRACTS, 



:399 Almond Flavor. 

Pound six bitter and twelve sweet almonds in a mortar, 
and add to pudding sauce, or add with this a teas{)Oonful 
of extract nectarine. 

400 Mace Compound. 

One teacup of lemon juice, one-half ounce of blade mace; 
let steep six hours, then add half a teacup of water and let 
it scald fifteen or twenty minutes; bottle and seal for use 
as directed. — O'Neil. 

401 Bitter Almond Flavoring. 

From May till November three or four peach leaves 
scalded in milk make a delicious flavoring for cake, custard 
and ice cream. 

403 Essence ot &inger and Vanilla. 

We prefer to use Brown's Jamaica Ginger (Philadelphia 
maker), and Burnet's Extract of Vanilla. 

403 Pickled Peach Vinegar 

Is often a pleasant flavor to molasses or other sauces. 



MKRINGUE8. 145 



MERINGUES 



These have become an every-day addition to pastries, 
custards, and even charlottes. We therefore give two 
receipts for French and Italian meringues, as well as those 
interspersed throughout other receipts. 

404 To Make a French Meringue. 

To each white of an egg, beaten stiff as possible, take two 
heaping tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar, sift it lightly 
and slowly into the whites, stirring till smooth; spread 
over your pie, pudding or fruit; sift a very trifle of sugar 
over the top and bake quickly. If the oven browns too 
fast shade the meringue with a paper that does not 
touch it. 

405 Italian Meringues. 

Boil four ounces of sugar slowly and steadily with two 
tablespoonfuls of water till it begins to crystalize, which 
can be told by its forming long threads as you give the 
skimmer a sudden jerk; then pour this onto the whites of 
two eggs, beaten to a very stiff froth, and stir for five 
or ten minutes off the fire ; sprinkle the top with split 
and blanched almonds, and bake as you do French 
meringues.

146 CUSTARDS. 



CUSTARDS. 



( General Directions.) 

Eggp, milk and sugar of the best; a custard boiler or a 
tin pail set in a kettle of boiling water will answer the 
purpose, for boiled custards; bring the milk to a boil, stir 
your yolks of eggs and sugar together; pour a teacup of 
scalding milk on the eggs and sugar, blend all smoothly 
and then stir them into your scalding milk and keep your 
spoon moving around the boiler for a minute or a minute 
and-a half, by the clock, till the custard begins to thicken 
and cling to the spoon; take quickly from the fire and 
continue to stir for a few moments after it has been removed. 
Never add flavoring till the custard is almost cold. 

Baking custard can be accomplished by simply setting 
the pan containing the ingredients in the oven and baking 
twenty minutes; but a method that gives a more delicate 
flavor is to cover your pudding-dish or pan, set it in ano- 
ther larger pan, and two-thirds fill the latter with boiling 
water and let it bake till the center is like jelly and shakes. 

As the foundation of most creams is a well-made boiled 
custard, and the main element of most puddings is "a 
baked custard with additions," it behooves every one 
desirous of being a dainty cook to make a study of 
custards. 

406 Delicate Baked Custard. 

Heat a quart of milk quite hot, that it may not whey 
when boiled, let it stand till cold; then beat six eggs very 
light (five will do very well), and add to the milk; sweeten to 



CUSTARDS. 147 

taste with white sugar, about a teacupful; flavor with lemon 
or vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Fill cups or bowls and set 
them in the oven in a dripping-pan filled with boiling 
water. When the Avater has boiled ten or fifteen minutes, 
take out a cup, and if the cup is the consistency of jelly, 
it is done. Cover the cups and they will bake better. 

407 Boiled Custard, No. 1. 

One quart of boiling milk, to which add the yolks of 
eight eggs and one heaping teacup of sugar, stir just one 
minute before taking off the fire; this is the genuine old- 
fashioned boiled custard; when cold, flavor with vanilla or 
bitter almonds or use no flavoring, but after it is poured 
into the cups grate a little nutmeg over each. 

408 Cream Custards. 

■ One quart of sweet cream, eight tablespoonfuls of white 
sugar, whites of four eggs. Stir the sugar into the 
cream, then add the whites of the eggs without beating 
them; stir all well and flavor with bitter almonds or 
vanilla; bake in cups set in a pan half filled Avith boiling 
water; put in the oven and bake till it thickens. 

Mrs. Dr. Stbwart of Dayton, Ohio. 

409 Boiled Custard, No. 2. 

Bring two quarts of milk to a boil, stir into them two 
even tablespoonfuls of corn starch and let cook till smooth 
and well done; add yolks of three eggs beaten very light 
with a cup and a-half of sugar; stir well for one minute by 
the clock; now stir in lightly the whites of four eggs 
beaten ts a stiff froth, allowing it half a minute more 
over the fire ^to set the eggs. Flavor with vanilla or 



148 CUSTARDS. 

chocolate, or both. This is a i:anicularly nice custard, and 
though it is comparatively inexpensive, it does not taste 
cheap. 

4:10 Caramel Custard Pudding. 

One small teacupful of brown sugar in a Charlotte 
Russe pan, in which it is to be baked, set in the oven five 
minutes or longer; prepare a custard of four eggs to one 
quart of milk and one heaping teacup of sugar; pour this 
gently into the pan and bake promptly. 

411 Coffee Custard, Whipped Cream on Top. 

Take a large cup of freshly ground coffee, break an egg 
into it and mix well; put it into a coffee-pot with a pint of 
boiling water, and let it stand ten minutes; turn it off very 
clear in a saucepan; add a pint off cream and give it one 
boil. Have ready eight eggs, well beaten, one and-a-half 
large cups of sugar; turn the coffee and cream boiling hot 
on the eggs, and finish in hot water till thick and smooth. 

412 Lemon Custards that will Keep a Week. 

Beat the yolks of eight eggs until they are white, then 
put to them a pint of boiling water, the rinds of two lemons 
grated, and the juice sweetened to your taste; stir it on 
the fire until it is thick, then add almond or nectarine flavor- 
ing, and after giving it one scald, put in cups to eat cold. 

If it does not come thick enough a little corn starch can 
be added. 

413 Custard to Turn Out. 

Mix with the yolks of four eggs, well beaten, one pint 
of new milk, sweetened with sugar, about half a teacupful, 
and boil over the fire till it thickens; then add half a box 



CUSTARDS. 149 

of gelatine, previously dissolved by soaking one hour in 
half a teacup of cold water, then adding two tablespoon- 
fuls of boiling water, and set it over the steam of the tea- 
kettle till needed. Pour into a dish and stir till a little 
cooler, then pour into cups to turn out when cold. Add 
flavoring to the eggs. 

411 Chocolate Custard. 

One pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of grated choco- 
late boiled in the milk, three eggs beaten light, stirred into 
the boiling milk; let the whole come to a boil again. 
Sweeten to taste. 

415 Cocoanut Custard. 

To one pound of grated cocoanut allow one quart of 
scalding milk and one heaping cup of sugar. Beat well the 
yolks of six eggs and stir them alternately in the milk with 
the cocoanut and sugar. Pour this into a dish lined with 
paste and bake twenty minutes, or, if preferred, treat the 
milk, cocoanut, eggs and sugar as for boiled custard, and 
serve in cups. 

416 Almond Custard. 

One pint of new milk, one liberal half cup of powdered 
sugar, one-quarter of a pound of almonds blanched and 
powdered, two teaspoonf uls of rose or orange-flower water, 
the yolks of four eggs. Stir this in the double boiler as 
directed for boiled custards. Wlien it is the thickness of 
cream take it from the fire, and when cool pour into custard 
cups. Beat the whites of the eggs with eight tablespoon- 
fuls of pulverized sugar to a stiff froth, and lay on top. 



160 CUSTARDS. 

417 Snow Custard ("Winter Eeceipt). 

For a three-pint mold put one-half box of gelatine in a 
bowl, soak it one hour with one pint of cold water, then 
add one pint of boiling water, stir until dissolved; then 
put to cool; sweeten with three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar and flavor with the juice of three lemons. Whip 
the whites of tour eggs to a stiff froth; add them to the 
gelatine when it begins to stiffen or set; then whip the 
whole to a light froth, and when all begins to stiffen pour 
it into a mold. Take the four yolks of the eggs and make 
a rich custard, flavor it with the rind of one lemon and pour 
round. This pudding will keep for a day or two. This 
receipt is excellent in cold weather or where you can use 
plenty of ice. 

4:18 Snow Custard (Summer Eeceipt). 

Soak one-half a box of gelatine one hour in half a pint 
of cold water; add half a pint of boiling water, three- 
quarters of a pound of powdered sugar. Beat the whites 
of three eggs, add gradually the gelatine and sugar, when 
it begins to set then the iuice of three lemons, grated rind 
of one; beat constantly, hard, and fast, from half an hour 
to an hour, or until it is about as stiff as pancake batter; 
put it in the dish in which it is to be served, and set in a 
cold place or on ice; make the yolks into a soft custard, 
with a pint of milk, flavoring with the rind of the lemon. 
This pudding is good the second day, eaten with straw- 
berries or canned fruit. 



CREAMS. 151 



CREAMS. 



In most Creams a well-made custard is the basis of their 
composition. This is also somewhat the case in Charlotte 
Russe. Nothing is more simple than to make a smooth, 
rich boiled custard, and we refer our readers to the "gen- 
eral instruciions for making custards," which precedes 
Custards. The second thing in creams is the proper pre- 
paration of gelatine or isinglass. All gelatine or isinglass 
melts more smoothly and richly if soaked at least one hour 
in cold water, a scant teacup of water to an ounce of 
either. When all the water is absorbed, and the gelatine 
soft, add from two to four tablespoonf uls of boiling water, 
and set it on the back of the stove to melt. When it is a 
smooth glue stir it into your custard. Plan to have the 
gelatine ready to pour into the custard within five minutes 
after you remove both from the fire, and stir till it is so 
smoothly mixed with the custard as to be a part of it. The 
second and most important matter is just when to combine 
the custard, or simple gelatine, with the whipped cream. 
Your custard with the gelatine in, or the latter properly 
dissolved, must be exactly at the point where it is ready to 
set. You can easily tell this by the manner in which it 
begins to adhere to the bottom and sides of the bowl or 
pan. If the gelatine is not cold enough, and your cream 
is almost whipped, take a piece of ice as large as your two 
hands, fold it in an old cloth and beat it with a hammer or 
mallet till very fine; open the cloth stir a teacup of salt in 
the ice; pour it quickly into a pan, and set the lukewarm 
custard or gelatine upon it, stirring and beating till cold; 



152 CREAMS. 

then the cream and custard can be blended quickly, but 
thoroughly. By neglecting these precautions, we have 
seen the most disheartening failure of the very best 
receipts; the mortified cook all the time protesting that 
she had done just what the book said. If you wish to 
make a charlotte or cream directly after breakfast, when 
you rise in the morning drop your gelatine into a tumbler, 
and cover it with the cold water; have your milk put on 
the stove to boil while you are breakfasting. When you 
go into the kitchen add the boiling water to the gelatine, 
and set it on to melt; break your eggs, add your sugar, et 
cetera, and in five minutes your custard is made. While 
it is cooling whip your cream, and in twenty-five minutes, 
if your plans are well arranged, you have made an elabo- 
rate dessert; and its preparation has been a pleasure rather 
than a toil. 

Let us reiterate that the temperature in the combination 
of custard, cream and gelatine is the secret of success. 
Cold cream to whip, cold eggs to beat, cool custard to stir 
into the cream, will encourage you to believe that the art 
of cookery is yours. 

Notwithstanding the best cookery books instruct you to 
"soak the gelatine in milk," and "boil the gelatine in 
milk," we can from our own experience give the advice of 
Punch to the young man about to marry, "Don't." 

Gelatine and milk, either soaked or boiled, are very apt 
to curdle. In receipts for Spanish cream this boiling gela- 
tine in milk and adding eggs afterwards, is always strongly 
urged. Our own plan is to boil the milk, scald the yolks 
of eggs and sugar in the same. Take them off the fire and 
cool five minutes; then stir in the gelatine which has been 
warmed, till it is a smooth liquid. Set away to cool, and when 
cold and just ready to set, stir in the well-beaten whites. 



CREAMS. 15S 

419 Charlotte His sse, No. 1 (Isinglass). 

Sweeten and flavor to taste one quart of cold fresh cream; 
whip it to a froth with a whip churn, Dover egg-beater or 
wire spoon. Break up half an ounce of Cooper's isinglass 
into lialf a pint of cold water; let soak one hour, then set 
it over a boiling teakettle, or on the stove to dissolve. 
When thoroughly dissolved and cooled, pour it into the 
cream, stirring it until it begins to thicken. Line a mold 
with lady-fingerSj and pour in the mixture. 

420 Charlotte Russe, No. 2 (Isinglass). 

Four sheets of Cooper's isinglass broken up and soaked 
in cold water till soft, then pour off the water and put the 
isinglass into half a pint of boiling water; set it on the 
stove to stew down to one-half. Beat the yolks of four 
eggs till very light, with three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar; stir these into one pint of boiling milk. Beat the 
whites separately; strain the isinglass into this custard as 
it cools and begins to stiffen; whip in the whites, flavor 
with two teaspoons of vanilla. Have ready a quart of 
creamed churned to a froth, which add when the custard is 
quite cold and commencing to thicken, stir very thoroughly 
but quickly, and put into molds lined with sponge cake. 

421 Charlotte Eusse (Satie T.'s, No. 3 (Gelatine). 

Beat one pint of cream till thick and foamy; beat tlie 
whites of four eggs to a very stiff froth, soak two table- 
spoonfuls of gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of cold water 
one hour; then add two tablespoonfuls of boiling water; 
let it melt thoroughly and then cool, next put a scant tea- 
cup of pulverized sugar into a large bowl, add two tea- 
spoonfuls of extract of vanilla; pour the eggs, cream, and 



154 CREAMS. 

last the gelatine, all into this bowl, and beat with an egg- 
beater till well blended. Pour this mixture into Charlotte 
molds, lined with lady-fingens, and put it away on ice for 
three or four hours to set. This is very pretty, made in a 
glass bowl, with lady-fingers at the bottom and sides, and 
two crossed on the tops. In summer double the quantity 
of gelatine if you wish it to turn out on a dish. 

422 Charlotte Eusso (Gelatine). 

Three pints good cream, three-fourths of a pound pul- 
verized sugar, one ounce of best gelatine, six eggs. Divide 
the sugar in half, sweeten the cream with one-half, flavor 
with Burnet's extract of vanilla, and whip with a Dover 
egg-beater. Beat the eggs to a stiff froth, add the rest of 
the sugar, beating hard. As soon as the gelatine is weighed, 
put it into half a teacup of cold water to soak one or two 
hours; then add half a teacup of boiling water, melt and 
strain, and keep warm. Put the eggs and sugar into a 
large bowl, pour over the scalding gelatine, stir well and 
quickly, and when it is well cooled, add the whipped cream, 
and with great dispatch to avoid congealing in lumps. Pour 
in glass bowls and ornament to suit the taste. If this 
receipt is closely followed, one need never fail in making 
this delicious desert. 

423 :olate Charlotte Husse. 

Soak in cold water for one hour one ounce of isinglass 
or Cox's gelatine; take three ounces of best chocolate, 
grate it, melt it in three tablespoonfuls of water and two 
of white sugar; let it cook smooth. Mix it into a pint of 
sweet cream, adding the soaked gelatine. Put all into the 
double boiler and let scald till the whole is melted. Then 
take off the fire and pour it upon the yolks of eight and 
whites of four eggs, which have been beaten light, with 



%. CREAMS. 155 

half a pound of sugar. Simmer the whole over the fire, 
but do not let it boil; then take it off and whip toasti-ong 
froth. Line molds with sponge cake, fill with the Char- 
lotte and set on the ice. 

424 A Charlotte a la Parisienne (Gateau Noyeau). 

One large stale sponge cake, one cup of rich custard, one 
cup of sweet cream whipped, two tablespoonfuls of rose- 
water, one-half of a grated cocoanut, one-half pound of 
sweet almonds blanched and pounded, whites of four eggs 
beaten stiff, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Cut the cake in horizontal slices the whole length of the 
loaf. They should be half an inch thick. Divide the 
whipped egg into two portions; into one stir the cocoanut 
with half the sugar; into the other the almond paste, with 
the rest of the sugar. Spread the slices with these mix- 
tures, half with the cocoanut and half with the almond, and 
replace them in their original form, la3dng aside the top 
crust for a lid. Press all the sliced cake firmly together, 
that the slices may not slip, and with a sharp knife cut a 
deep cut out of the center down to the bottom slice, which 
must be left entire. Take out the rounds you have cut, 
leaving the walls an inch thick, and soak the part removed 
in a bowl with the custard. Rub it to a smooth batter, 
and whip it into the whipped cream, the rose-water in the 
almond paste will flavor it sufficiently. When it is a rich 
stiff cream, fill the cavity of the cake with it; put on the 
lid and then ice with the following: Whites of three eggs, 
one heaping cup of powdered sugar, juice of one lemon. 
Beat stiff, and cover the sides and top of the cake; set in a 
very cold place until needed. This is a delicious and ele- 
gant charlotte, which twenty-five years ago was called a 
"a Charlotte Polonaise." 



156 CREAMS. 

425 Bavarian Cream (Our Own). 

Take half a box of Nelson's or Cox's gelatine, pour over 
it half a teacup of cold water, let it soak one hour or more, 
then add two tablespoonfuls of boiling water and set the 
tin cup in which it is on the back part of the stove to tho- 
roughly dissolve. Put a pint of rich milk or cream in your 
custard pail; let it come to a boil, add two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of pulverized sugar and the yolks of four eggs 
stirred together; beat and stir one moment over the fire; 
take off and pour into a bowl to cool, adding the half ounce 
of gelatine; then take one pint of very cold sweet cream, 
add to it one teaspoonful of extract of vanilla (Burnet's) 
and two heaping tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar. Whip 
i t to a froth, skim off the whipped cream and place it in a 
sieve to drain; whip and skim till it is all frothed. If by 
this time your custard is cold enough to begin to set, stir 
cream and custard rapidly together; if not thoroughly 
cooled set it on some ice broken uj) fine, and having half a 
teacup or more of salt sprinkled among it; the moment it 
begins to set stir quickly but delicately together the cus- 
tard and whipped cream till well mixed; pour into a mold 
and set on ice or in a very cold place. 

426 Mrs. Henderson's Bavarian Cream. 

Sweeten with two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
whip one pint of cream to a stiff froth, laying it on a sieve 
to drain. 

Boil another pint of cream or rich milk with two heap- 
ing tablespoonfuls of sugar; take it off the fire and add 
half a box of Nelson's or Cox's gelatine (soaked for an 
hour in half a cupful of cold water in a warm place near 
the range; then add two tablespoonfuls boiling water and 
set over the steam of the teakettle till dissolved) ; when 



CREAMS. 157 

slightly cooledj stir in the yolks of four eggs well beaten ; 
when it has becorae quite cold and begius to thicken, stir 
it without ceasing a few minutes until it is very smooth, 
then stir in the whipped cream lightly until it is well 
mixed. Put it into a mold or molds and set it on the ice 
or in a cool place. We prefer the preceding receipt, but 
as the effect is somewhat different, we give both as both 
are excellent. 

427 Chocolate Bavarian Cream 

Can be made as the preceding, by adding two sticks of 
chocolate grated (soaked and stirred smooth in two table- 
spoonfuls of boiling water) to the yolks of the eggs. 

428 Spanish Cream. 

Dissolve half a package of Cox's gelatine in half a pint 
of cold milk. Simmer a quart of milk; while hot on the 
stove pour in the gelatine, stirring till perfectly dissolved- 
add the beaten yolks of eight eggs, sugar and vanilla, as 
for a custard, and let them scald one minute or a little more. 
When done pour the mixture into a large dish containing 
the well-beaten whites of the eight eggs; stir briskly for 
one minute and pour into molds. It will fill two quarts 
and one pint. Our experience leads us to say that if milk- 
man's milk and cream is used it is better not to soak the 
gelatine in milk, but water. 

429 Spanish Cream. 

One quart of milk, one and-a-half cups white sugar, one- 
quarter box shred gelatine, three eggs, one lemon, one gill 
of orange juice. Soak gelatine in one-half a coffee-cup of 
milk; boil one quart of milk and pour over the gelatine 
cautiously, a little at a time; turn the milk and gelatine 



158 CREAMS. 

on the sugar, yolks of eggs and orange (previously well 
beaten together) slowly, for fear of curdling stirring 
well. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, stir in a email 
one-half cup of sugar and the juice of one lemon. Spread 
this, like fi'osting, on top of the gelatine, milk, etc., 
with a wet knife, going round the rim of the dish first, 
covering gradually toAvards the center. Set in a quick oven 
onlv long enough to brown the frosting. It will be soft 
when taken from the oven, but quite stiff in a few hours or 
the following day, according to temperature. In winter it 
may bo made two days hefore ut^ing. It is not stiff enough 
to turn out of a mold, but is set in a silver dish.

430 Almond Bavarian Cream. 

Take three ounces of sweet and one of bitter almonds, 
blanch and skin them; put them into a pan on a moderate 
fire, stirring them continually. As soon as they have 
acquired a fine yellow color, take them off the fire, and 
when cold pound them into tine pieces; then add a pint of 
cream or rich milk nearly boiling and three or four heaping 
tablespoon fuls of sugar and half a package of gelatine, 
which has been soaked as before described. Put it upon 
the ice, and when about to thicken stir it until it is very 
smooth; then stir in lightly a pint of cream whipped and 
put it into a mold. 

431 Riz de I'lmperatrice (Queen's Eice). 

A large spoonful of rice, whitened in cold water; then 
put the rice in just enough milk to cook the rice properly. 
Take the yolks of four eggs and a cup of sugar, with a pint 
of milk, and cook like a custard. Mix the rice with the 
custard and set on the ice an hour and a half before din-

ner; add a pint of whipped cream and one-third of a box 
of gelatine and pour in a mold; before turning out of the 
mold, put some preserves in the bottom of the dish, and 
garnish the top with preserved cherries. This is the exact 
French receipt where something is preferred to rice: Use 
concentrated cocoanut, one teacup to the pint of milk; have 
the gelatine well dissolved and cool, but not cold, when 
added to the cream. 

4:32 Bavaroise (Parisian Eeceipt). 

A full pint of milk, four tablespoonfuls of ground coffee; 
cooked until well mixed, and strained through a jelly bag; 
add the yolks of four eggs, a cup of sugar, and cook as for 
a custard; set in the cold an hour and-a-half before dinner; 
add a pint of whipped cream, and gelatine one-half or a 
third of a box, the same amount as for Charlotte Russe.

433 Genoese Cream (Good). 

One pint of milk, one tablespoonful of flour, four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. Boil until it thickens slightly; add 
the yolks of three eggs and a jaiece of butter the size of an 
egg; flavor with lemon or vanilla. Cover the bottom of 
the dish with sponge cake, spreading one side of caVe with 
currant or other jelly. Pour on the cream and dust the 
top with sugar.

cup of powdered sugar together; stir in the gelatine and 
pour all into one quart of boiling milk. Flavor with van- 
illa. Let it cool and then stir it into the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a stiff' froth; pour into molds and let it stand 
four hours, when it will be ready to use. 

437 Blanc-Mange. 

This is an old-fashioned receipt, but after one has been 
cloyed on whipped cream, old-time blanc-mange will pro- 
duce quite a new sensation. 

Blanch four ounces of sweet almonds and half an ounce 
of bitter almonds; pound them in a wedgewood mortar, 
moistening them gradually with orange-flower water; mix 
this with one quart of fresh cream. Have the " largest 
half" of a box of Cox's gelatine soaking in half a cup of 



CREAMS. 101 

cold water one hour. Set your cream and almonds on the 
fire, stirring constantly; when it comes to a scald, pour in 
a scant teacup of sugar and the gelatine, and stir till it dis- 
solves. Put in molds. 

438 Cream a la Mode (G-ood). 

Put half a pound of white sugar into a deep glass dish; 
the juice of one large orange and one lemon; to one ounce 
of isinglass add one pint of water; let it simmer down 
one-half, and when cool and beginning to set strain it on 
the above, and by degrees add one and a-half pints of 
cream, that have been well whipped; stir till cool and place 
it on ice to stiffen. 

439 Tapioca Cream. 

Three-fourths of one cup of tapioca; add to it sufficient 
milk to make it soft, say one pint, and soak eight hours; 
then take one quart of milk, let it boil for a few minutes; 
beat three eggs, whites and yokes separately, stir the yolks 
into one cup of sugar and then the milk, and, when it be- 
gins to boil, add the tapioca; let it boil up and make sure 
it is thoroughly cooked, then stir the whites very evenly 
through it. Flavor to taste; eat cold. 

440 Peach Meringue. 

Cut up peaches and put in the bottom of a dish; sprinkle 
them with sugar. Make an icing of the whites of three 
eggs and three-fourths of a cup of sugar, spread over the 
peaches and bake a few minutes. Canned peaches cooked 
in a rich syrup and then skimmed out of it and treated iu 
this way, makes a pleasant desert.

162 ICE CREAMS. 

441 Orange Souffle. 

Two oranges peeled and cut in thin slices in your pud- 
ding-dish, with sugar sprinkled over them, and let stand 
an hour. Make a custard with the yolks of four eggs and 
one pint of milk, sweetened to taste, (about half a cup of 
sugar); pour over the oranges boiling hot. Beat the whites 
to a stiff froth with five tablespoonfuls of pulverized 
suo-ar, spread over the top of the custard; set the dish in a 
pan of water and put in the oven until it is a lovely brown. 

442 Fruit Charlotte. 

Line a dish with sponge cake, place upon the bottom, in 
the center of the dish, grated pine-apple; cover with a 
whipped cream charlotte. Keep back a little of the 
cream to pour over the top after it is turned out of the 
mold. 

ICE CREAMS. 



We have lived so much in the country that years ago we 
gave our mind to the simplification of making ice cream. 
We like a patent freezer; almost all are good, especially 
those that have not too much machinery, but we can make 
mighty good cream with a tall four-quart tin pail and an 
ordinary wooden bucket. Any of the receipts given are 
good. All cream is the richest — the flour, milk and whites 
of eggs with part cream is the next — the frozen custard is 
thoroughly digestible and an excellent and economical 
receipt. To freeze ice cream or water ices quickly and well: 
1st. Have your cream or custard on the ice for two or three 
hours before you are ready to use it; flavor and sweeten the 
former when you are prepared to freeze it. 2nd. Take a 



ICE CREAMS. 163 

fifteen-pound lump of ice, put it into an old bag or coffee 
sack, bave at your baud three pints of coarse salt; then 
take the flat of the axe or a mallet, or, if you bave neither, 
and are a woman, a great deal may be accomplished Avith 
a flat-iron, pound the xcejine, empty it out of the bag into 
an old disbpan or tub, pour over the salt, take your short- 
handled stove shovel or a scoop, mix all thoroughly and 
fill round the ice cream freezer after it has been properly 
placed in the tub, packing down with a wooden spade; 
then pour your cream into the freezer, stir and beat well 
while freezing; after it is pretty stiff, cover with a woolen 
cloth for one hour, 

443 Ice Cream. 

To one quart of cream take one heaping teacupful of 
sugar, grate in one-quarter of a vanil la bean, or two tea- 
spoonfuls of extract of vanilla, strain it and put it into 
your freezer; add the whites of two eggs beaten very light, 
with three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar to stiffen them. 
Freeze. N. B. — If your cream is not very rich, boil a 
little milk, sweeten it, beat two eggs very light and stir in 
and cook like soft custard. The flavor will perhaps be 
better if the vanilla bean is boiled a few minutes in a 
little milk, which may be added to the cream when cool. 

In Pennsylvania the cream is always allowed to scald 
and oool before using, and this ought always to be done 
Avhen the cream is for an invalid. 

444 Ice Cream. 

Three pints sweet cream, one quart of new milk, one 
pint of powdered sugar; put in a freezer till thoroughly 
chilled through, then add the whites of two eggs beaten 
light, and having three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar 
in them, then freeze. 



164 ICK CREAM. 

445 Ice Cream, No. 2. 

Boil two quarts of milk, into which stir a pint of cold 
milk that has had four level tablespoonfuls of arrowroot 
or corn starch mixed smoothly into it, then scald, but not 
boil; when cold, add two quarts of cream, a tablespoonful 
of vanilla or other flavoring, and two pounds (or pints) of 
sugar; put in the freezer and whip till well chilled, then 
add the whites of six eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. 

446 White Ice Cream. 

Three pints of milk, whites of four eggs beaten light, 
three tablespoonfuls of arrowroot mixed in a little cold 
water and added to the eggs. Boil the milk and pour over 
the eggs, then set over the fire and stir till it thickens a 
little; when nearly cold, add a quart of cream, sweeten and 
flavor to the taste. We allow a cupful of sugar and a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, Burnet's extract, to every quart. If 
you have no arrowroot, use half a teacup of flour, let it 
boil well, and then strain well. 

447 Vanilla Ice Cream— Miss Parloa. 

This receipt is admirable if anyone likes so rich a com- 
bination, and can be made by a boy of twelve. The founda- 
tion given in this rule is suitable for all kinds of ice cream: 

One generous pint of milk, one cupful of sugar, half a 
cupful of flour, scant, two eggs, one quart of cream, one 
tablespoonful of vanilla extract, and when the cream is 
added, another teacupful of sugar. Let the milk come to a 
boil. Beat the first cupful of sugar, the flour and eggs 
together, and stir into the boiling milk. Cook twenty 
minutes, stirring often, strain and set away to cool, and 
when cool add the sugar, cream and seasoning, and freeze. 



ICE CREAM. 165 

448 Caramel Ice Cream. 

Take two pints of brown sugar, put it in an iron skillet 
over a brisk fire until it is dissolved, stirring it constantly to 
prevent its burning; have a pint of milk at boiling point 
and stir a little of this at a time into the sugar, as it shows 
a disposition to scorch. Strain it, and when cool add it to 
three quarts of pure cream well beaten in the freezer, and 
freeze. 

449 Norvell House Caramel Ice Cream. 

Four quarts of pure cream, four heaping cups of pow- 
dered sugar, five tablespoonfuls of caramel; mix and freeze 
hard. 

450 Caramel Custard Ice Cream. 

Make two quarts of rich boiled custard, substituting for 
sugar one pint of brown sugar, treated as in caramel ice 
cream No. 1; freeze. 

451 Biscuit G-lace. 

To half a pound of powdered sugar add the yolks of 
four eggs and vanilla flavor; beat well and then take two 
quarts of well whipped cream, and mix with sugar and 
yolks; color some of it red and spread on the bottom of 
paper capsules and fill up with the fresh cream. Then put 
them in a tin box, with cover, and pack well up on all sides 
with pounded ice and salt. Let stand for two hours; it is 
then ready for use. 

The above receipt was procured from the Fi-ench cook 
at the St. Nicholas Hotel, New York, where biscuits glace 
reach a perfection that cannot be excelled by any confec- 
tioner. 



166 ICB CREAM 

45 Chocolate Ice. 

Grate four heaping tablespoonfuls of Maillard's triple 
vanilla chocolate; stir it smooth with two tablespoonfuls of 
hot water and the yolks of two eggs, put in a double 
boiler half a pint of boiling water, one teacup and-a-half 
of sugar; stir well for three or five minutes; then pour in 
a quart of milk that is at a keen boil; stir three minutes; 
take off the tire and add the beaten whites of the two 
eggs. Strain. Let get very cold and freeze, 

453 Chocolate Ice Cream. 

Six tablespoonfuls grated chocolate, one quart milk, two 
tablespoonfuls corn starch, two cups sugar, one quart 
cream. Boil the milk, add corn starch, boil five minutes, 
add sugar and chocolate, strain, and add cream. 

454 Bisque. 

One-half gallon of freshly turned bonny clabber or milk 
that has soured and set, one-half gallon of rich sweet 
cream, a vanilla bean boiled in a half pint of sweet milk; 
sweeten. Churn five minutes before freezing. One can of 
condensed milk can be used with less clabber. This is a 
Virginia receipt, our own is somewhat similar, except that 
six hours before making the bisque we take two quarts of 
fresh milk, add to it a scant teacup of sugar, a teaspoonful 
of vanilla, and set it by stirring in two scant teaspoonfuls 
of liquid rennet, prepared by Wyth, of Philadelphia. 



WATER ICES. 167 



WATER ICES. 



455 Water Ices. 

We wish to say a word on the subject of water ices. If 
you desire ihem to freeze promptly and be rich and smooth, 
be careful to obey these directions: 

Know what quantity you need for your freezer, and 
make your calculations accordingly. Take the requisite 
amount of water and sugar, in the proportion of one pint 
of sugar to one pint of water, and let them boil till they 
form a rich syrup; it will take quarter of an hour if made 
with boiling water, and longer if with cold water. Then 
set it away to get thoroughly cold; add to this your lemon 
juice, pine-apple, orange, raspbeny, currant, etc. Allow the 
whites of three eggs to every two quarts of the mixture; 
whip them very light, and when the ice has been frozen 
till it is just ready to stiffen, stir in the whites of the eggs. 

Confectioners never use white of egg, nor gelatine. The 
latter is detestable. A good water ice can be made without 
either. 

456 Lemon Ice. 

Take the juice of four large lemons, add about three 
pints of thin syrup made with about one pint of sugar. 
Into every quart when it begins to freeze, stir the whites 
of two eggs beaten very light, with a little powdered sugar. 
This will make it smooth. The word " about" is used in 
this receipt, because you must have a strong, rich lemon 
flavor, be the quantity more or less. 



168 WATER ICES. 

Any kind of water ice may be made in this way, by 
niixiniw the strained juice of the fruit, currant, raspberry, 
strawberry, etc., with syrup flavored to taste, and add the 
white of egg when it begins to freeze. 

457 Lemon Ice.— Margery Daw. 

One pint of lemon juice, four pints of water, one table- 
spoonful of gum arable, dissolved in water, the rind of two 
or three lemons, the whites of three eggs, sugar to make 
sweeter than lemonade. Mix the lemon juice, water, sugar, 
gum arable and the grated rind of the lemon. Just as it is 
beginning to be very cold in the freezer, add the whites 
of eggs beaten light. Do not strain, but let the rinds of 
the lemons remain. 

N.B. — We fear we would disobey this last. 

458 Pine-Apple Ice. 

Two juicy ripe pine-apples, peeled and cut small; juice 
and zest or rubbed peel of two lemons, two pints sugar 
made into syrup with two pints of water. Strew some 
sugar over the pine-apple and lemon juice, and let it stand 
an hour or more; mash all up together and strain out the 
syrup through a bag; add the boiled syrup and freeze. 

459 Pine-Apple Ice, No. 2. 

One pine-apple cut fine, one pound sugar made into syrup, 
with one pint of boiling water. Let the mixture stand six 
hours, then strain and add one quart thin syrup, white of 
one egg and juice of one lemon. Freeze. 

460 Iced Coffee. 

One pint of strong coffee; one pint of rich cream; one- 
half a pound of sugar; then freeze. 



WATER ICES. 169 

4(Jl Tutti Frutti. 

When a rich vanilla cream is partly frozen, candied cher- 
ries, chopped raisins, chopped citron, or any other candied 
fruit chopped rather fine are added; add about half the 
quantity of fruit that there is of ice cream; mold and 
imbed in ice and salt. 

462 Currant Ice 

Is a very nice and pretty country dessert. Make a syrup 
of one quart of water and one pint of sugar; let it boil 
down; skim, and when cold add a pint of currant juice. 
When partly frozen stir in the beaten white of one egg and- 
a-half teaspoonful of extract of nutmeg. 

463 Frozen Strawberries— Very Nice. 

Two quarts of nice fresh berries, one pint of sugar, one 
pint of water, juice of two lemons. Let the berries and 
sugar stand for an hour or two, and then rub through a 
sieve; add the water and lemon juice, and freeze as yon 
would lemon ice. 

464 Orange Ice. 

Cut and sugar well six oranges, press them through a 
coarse sieve, add the juice of two lemons and three table- 
spoonfuls of gelatine soaked and stewed till smooth; pour 
this into a quai-t of rich boiled syrup, made as in receipt 
No. 455; freeze; or you may omit the gelatine and substi- 
tute the whites of two eggs, or one tablespoonful of gum< 
arable. 



I'/O FROSTING. 



FROSTING 



If made properly will prove "sure every time." The 
secret in boiling frosting lies in knowing just when to take 
it off the stove. 

465 Trosting. 

To one cup of sugar I take the white of one egg, just 
cover the sugar with water and let it boil without stirring 
till it ro2yes/ have the egg beaten, and when the sugar has 
boiled sufficiently stir into the egg and continue stirring 
till cool. If boiled too much, and the frosting is inclined 
to dry before cooling, it can be remedied by adding a drop 
or two of hot water. 

466 Confectioners' Icing, 

Beat the whites of two eggs with eight large spoonfuls 
of white sugar, place in a small pan and cook over the 
boiling teakettle for five minutes, stirring constantly; 
spread it on the cake with a knife, and as quickly as possi- 
ble, as it hardens immediately. 

467 Boiled Icing. 

Four tablespoonfuls of hot water, half a pint of granu- 
lated sugar, the whites of two eggs, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of citric acid (finely powdered). Put the water 
and the sugar together into a small saucepan; stir well 
together to moisten the sugar all through, and set it on the 
stove, where it will simmer slowly while you beat the eggs 
to a stiff froth; boil the syrup until it will thread when 



OAKES. IVI 

<Jropped from a spoon (or begins to candy), then pour it 
over the beaten eggs, beating briskly all the time. Continue 
beating until the mixture is thick and light, and nearly 
cold, then stir in the citiic acid. Flavor same as cake, if 
desired. 

468 Old-fashioned Frosting. 

Whites of three eggs, one pound of powdered sugar, 
one-half teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a little flavoring. 
Put the whites of the eggs in a bowl with a little of the 
sugar, and beat with a wire spoon to a froth, then add the 
sugar and the cream of tartar, a little at a time, beating 
constantly until when the frosting is dropped from the 
spoon the drops retain their form, add the flavoinng. If 
the quantity of sugar given is not sufficient, add more. 
This receipt is enough for two cakes. One or two drops 
of boiling water makes icing smoother for the outside coat. 

Pink frosting is very effective on some cakes; it can be 
obtained by adding a few drops of cochineal syrup to plain 
frosting.

G-eneral Directions for Mixing Cake— From Mrs. 
Welch's Book. 

First, get everything that will be needed ready before 
the mixing begins — the pans lined with paper and greased 
— bowls, spoons, egg-beater, grater, sifted flour, weighed 
or measured ready for use, milk, eggs, sugar, etc., should 
be close at hand. The oven, too, should be at the proper 
temperature and all things so arranged that when once the 
eggs are broken and the mixing actually begun, nothing 
need interrupt or delay proceedings until the process is 



172 CAKES. 

complete and the cake in the oven. Flour should be sifted 
before measured, unless the contrary is expressly advised; 
if baking powder is to be used, that should be sifted with 
the flour; soda and cream of tartar should both be added 
dry to the flour, and perfectly distributed through it by 
several siftings; cups or measures should not be heaped. 
When all things are ready, the order of mixing, is, in gen- 
eral, as follows: 

1. Cream the butter, 

2. Mix with it the sugar, and blend both together until 
they make a smooth, light paste. 

3. The beaten yolks of the eggs are next added. 

4. Stir in a little flour, then add a part of the milk, then 
flour, then milk, until all the milk has been added. This 
process should use at least half the flour. 

5. The flavoring extracts come next. 

6. Sift in gradually a part of the remaining flour; add 
the whites of the eggs well beaten, and at the same time 
the remainder of the flour. 

1. All cake should be put at first into a moderate oven, 
so that it may have a chance to rise before the crust begins 
to form. 

N. B. — Two-thirds of the art of cake making is in the 
management of your oven, and to attain that knowledge 
requires patience, perseverance, and practice. 

469 Black Wedding Cake. 

Thirteen pounds raisins, five pounds curi'ants, three 
pounds candied lemon, three pounds citron, four pounds 
butter, six pounds sugar, thirty-six eggs, one pint molasses, 
four pounds flour, two ounces mace, half ounce nutmeg, 
half box cinnamon, half box cloves, two and-a-half pints 
strong coffee. — Mrs. Lswis Daven-port. 

470 Excellent Fruit Cake.— Good. 

One cup of bi-own sugar, one-half cup of butter, one cup 
of molasses, one-half cup of sour milk, two and one half 



CAKES. 1Y3 

cups of flour, yolks of four eggs, cloves, allspice, cinnamon 
and nutmeg, each one-half teaspoonful, and oneteaspoonful 
bicarbonate of soda added to the milk. Then stir in one 
pound of raisins, one pound of currants, one-quarter of a 
pound of citron, all well dredged with one teacup of flour. 

471 Mrs. H. M. D.'s Reliable Fruit Cake— Good. 

One pound of light brown sugar, ten ounces of butter, 
eight eggs, broken into the butter and sugar, after it has 
been stirred to a cream; one tablespoon rose-water, one 
teaspoonful ext. bitter almonds (Burnet's), one teaspoonful 
of baking powder in one pound of flour and two pounds of 
raisins, mace and nutmeg; pour into a pan till half the 
quantity required is in, then cut slips of citron, dredge 
them with flour, sprinkle on the top of the batter, put in 
another layer, and repeat, this being an excellent way of 
putting in the citron; finish with a layer of the cake batter 
and bake forty-five minutes, or more. 

472 Imperial Cake. 

One pound of sugar and one pound of butter, stirred to 
a cream, then beaten yolks of ten eggs, grated rind and 
juice of one lemon, then one pound of flour and the stiff 
whites of the eggs; have prepared beforehand one pound 
of almonds, blanched and split (or if you prefer, pounded), 
one-half pound of raisins stoned and halved, and one-half 
pound of citron cut in thin slips; have these well dredged 
with two tablespoonfuls of extra flour, one tablespoonful 
of extract of nectarine in one teaspoonful of water, and one 
tablespoonf ul of rose-water and one of orange-flower water. 
This is a delicious cake, and when cut is very distinguished- 
looking; will keep a long time. 



1V4 CAKES. 

473 White Fruit Cake- Very Nice. 

One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, one cup of milk^ 
four cups of flour, whites of six egga, four very small tea- 
spoons of baking powder, two coffee-cups of raisins, boiled, 
drained dry, and stoned, and then rolled in flour, citron, if 
you like. After all is mixed, beat very hard. 

Miss Carrie S . 

474 Loaf or Bread Cake. 

Two pounds of light dough, one pound of sugar, one- 
half pound of butter, three eggs, and one teaspoonful of 
saleratus. Rub the butter and sugar together, then add 
the eggs, well beaten, and the saleratus. Work the mix- 
ture thoroughly into the dough, until it is entirely smooth. 
Flavor with one teaspoonful of ground mace and one grated 
nutmeg, three teaspoonfuls of molasses, a coffee-cupful of 
seeded raisins. A few thin bits of citron are an improve- 
ment. Put it to rise as soon as mixed and bake in a slow 
oven, and bake about one hour. This will make two ordi- 
nary sized loaves; and if frosted is nearly as good as the 
old-times Connecticut election cake. Use extra flour for 
dredging the fruits, and add half a teacupful if the dough 
seems soft. 

475 Hich Bread Cake. 

Four cups of light dough, two cups of sugar, one cup of 
butter, three eggs, one cup of raisins, well floured, a little 
nutmeg, half a teaspoon cloves and the same of cinnamon, 
half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water. Let it 
rise a short time before baking; then put in the raisins and 
bake in a very slow oven.

476 Aunt Fanny's Loaf Cake. 

Six teacups of bread dough, five eggs, three teacups of 
sugar, one cup of butter, two teaspoonfuls of ground cloves 
and cinnamon mixed, half a nutmeg, one and-a-half pounds 
of raisins. Bake in a moderate oven. 

477 Short Bread— The True Scotch Receipt. 

Four pounds of flour, two and-a-half pounds of butter, 
one and one-quarter pounds of sugar, one wine-glass of 
rose-water, one-half pound of caraway comfits and one- 
half pound of citron. Rub the butter and sugar to a 
cream, add the rose-water and then the flour, roll out to 
rather less than half an inch in thickness, and strew over 
the top the candy comfits and the citron cut in thin pieces 
the size of your thumb nail, pass your rolling pin over 
this and then cut out into squares and diamonds with a 
paste-jigger, and bake in a dripping-pan; it will keep nice 
and fresh two or three months. This receipt has been in 
an old Scotch family for more than three-quarters of a 
century, and has always been the New Year's cake in the 
old-fashioned Knickerbocker visitations on that day. The 
candy and citron make it a very handsome-looking cake, as 
well as delightful in flavor. 

478 Election Cake. 

Eight coffee-cups of flour, three pints of milk, three cups 
shortening (two of butter, one of lard), four cups of sugar, 
six eggs, two oranges, one and-a-half pounds of raisins, 
half pound citron, one yeast cake or one cup of liquid yeast, 
four nutmegs, one tablespoonful of salt. If a yeast cake 
is used dissolve it well, make a sponge of it (do the same 
with liquid yeast), and some of the flour about noon. Beat 
part of the butter and sugar to a cream, and when the 



176 CAKES. 

sponge is light add it to it, and let it rise until very light. 
About nine o'clock add the rest of the butter and sugar, 
well beaten, and other ingredients (like other cake, only 
using the hands and beating thoroughly), saving out 
part of citron and raisins until morning, then add them, 
put into pans (seven) and stand until very light. Bake 
about one hour. Cousin Annie Dwigiit. 

479 Good Pound Cake— Miss Beecher. 

One pound powdered sugar, one pound sifted flour, 
three-quarters of a pound of butter, eight eggs and one 
nutmeg; rub sugar and butter to a cream, then add yolks, 
spice, and part of the flour; add the whites with the rest 
of the flour. 

480 Delicate Cake. 

One cup of butter beaten to a cream, with two of sugar; 
add the whites of eight eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and 
three and one-third cups of unsifted floui', in which has 
been mixed one teaspoonful of baking powder; then sieve 
the flour twice, add one teaspoonful of essence of bitter 
almond. 

481 Delicate Cake. 

One cup of butter, one cup of corn starch, two cups of 
sugar, two cups of flour, one cup of sweet milk, the whites 
of seven eggs, three teaspoons of baking powder, and 
flavor with almond.

482 Mrs. Henderson's Delicate Cake. 

Of this receipt Mrs. Welch says: "'I have tried it many 
times, and always with success. The cake is mixed con- 
trary to the usual rules." 



CAKES. 177 

Ingkedients, — Whites of six eggs, scant three-quarters 
of a cupful of butter, one and one-quarter cupfuls of pul- 
verized sugar, two cupfuls of flour, juice of half a lemon, 
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of soda. If soda is \ised, 
mix it well with flour and pass it through the sieve sev- 
eral times to distribute it equally. Beat the butter to a 
light cream, and add the flour to it, stirring it in gradually 
with the ends of the fingers until it is a smooth paste. Beat 
the whites of the six eggs to a stiff froth, and mix in them 
the pulverized sugar; now stir the egg and sugar gradually 
into the flour and butter, adding also the lemon juice, and 
mix it smoothly together with the egg whisp. As soon as 
it is perfectly smooth put it into the oven, the heat of 
which should be rather moderate at first. When done, and 
still hot, spread over it a frosting made in the following 
manner: Use a heaping teacupful of fine pulverized sugar 
to the white of each egg, or say a pound of sugar to the 
whites of three eggs. Beat the eggs until they are foam- 
ing only; do not beat them to a froth. The sugar may all 
be poured on the egg at once, or if considered easier to 
mix, it may be gradually added. Either way, as soon as 
the sugar and eggs are thoroughly stirred together, and 
flavored with a little vanilla or lemon, the icing is ready to 
spread over the cake. The icing made with the white of 
one egg is quite sufficient to frost an ordinary sized cake. 
This cake may be made with one teaspoonful of baking 
powder, or with prepared flour, or with one-quarter tea- 
spoonful of soda, and one-half teaspoonful cream of tartar, 
when the essence of lemon should be used instead of lemon 
juice.

4:83 Angel's Food. 

Whites of eleven eggs, one and one-half tumblers gran- 
ulated sugar, one tumbler sifted flour, one teaspoonful of 
extract of vanilla, one teaspoonful cream tartar. Sift the 
flour four times, then add cream of tartar, and sift 
again, but have only one tumbler after sifting; sift the 
sugar and measure; beat the eggs to a stiff froth, add 
sugar lightly, then the flour very gently, then vanilla. Do 
not stop beating till you put all in the pan. Bake forty 
minutes in moderate oven, try with straw; if too soft let 
it remain a few minutes longer. Turn pan upside down to 
cool, and when cold take out by loosening around the sides 
with a knife. Use a pan that has never been greased. 
The tumbler for measuring must hold two and three- 
quarters gills. Beat eggs on a large platter, and mix the 
batter on same platter. 

48 -i Angel's Food. 

Whites of eleven eggs, one and-a-half tumblers granu- 
lated sugar, one tumbler of sifteii flour, one teaspoonful 
cream of tartar, one teaspoonful vanilla extract, sift flour 
once, beat the eggs to stiff froth, add the sugar, stir as 
little as possible, then half of the flour, reserving the other 
half to stir the cream of tai'tar into; add vanilla, then the 
cream of tartar and flour. The trouble with this cake is that 
people are under the impression that after the ingredients 
are added, it requires a great deal of beating, which is 
very apt to make it tough. The less you stir it, the more 

ft and spongy it will be.

4S5 Angel's Food. 

Half a pint of sifted flour, one even teaspoon ful of corn 
starch, three even teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, four 
tablespoonf uls of hot water, one cup and-a-half of granulated 
sugar, the whites of eleven eggs, half a teaspoon ful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of flavoring; sift the flour, corn starch, 
and cream of tartar together through a very fine sieve; put 
the water and sugar in a saucepan, stir well together; put 
it on the stove and let it simmer slowly while you heat the 
eggs; sprinkle the salt over the whites of the eggs and 
beat them to a stiff froth. Boil the syrup until it will 
thread, and pour it slowly over the beaten eggs; beat all 
briskly until the mixture is light and cool; then sift the 
flour over it, little at a time, and stir it gently until all the 
flour is in and the batter is free from lumps; stir in the 
flavoring, and pour the batter into a three-quart pan with 
a tube in the center; bake in a moderate oven about forty 
minutes. Stick a straw into the cake, if it comes out clean, 
the cake is done. Turn the pan upside down and let it 
rest on the table until the cake is nearly cold, then remove 
it from the pan and place it bottom up on a large flat 
plate. Cover with boiled icing. 

N. B. — In making the Angel's Food, the beating and 
mixing must all be done with a wire-spoon egg-beater (not 
a Dover). The eggs must be very cold. Grease the pan 
very slightly — do not use a piece of butter larger than a 
pea; do not cut this cake until it is ten or twelve hours old. 
Better when two days old. ISaio the cake with the knife 
when cutting it. Mrs. Pitkin, Chicago.

sucar, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, juice and rind 
of one lemon, or one teaspoonful of extract of lemon, one- 
half teaspoonful of carbonate of ammonia. Beat the yolks 
and one-half tumbler of sugar very light; beat the whites 
to a stiff froth, beating in lightly the remainder of the 
sugar, then add the beaten yolks and sugar and flavoring; 
stir in the flour lightly, adding the ammonia last. Bake 
in a tin the same as Angel's Food, without greasing it; 
sift the sugar once and the flour four times; turn the tin 
upside down to cool, as in Angel's Food.— Margery Daw. 
N. B. — Carbonate of ammonia can be powdered fine and 
dissolved in the lemon juice, or sprinkled over and stirred 
into the batter the last thing.

13 



194 LA.TER CAKES. 

The yolks of the eggs, the sugar and lemon juice should 
be stirred hard together five minutes, the whites beaten 
separately, until they stand stiflF. The whole should then 
be stirred slowly together, adding at the last the flour, and 
do not beat after it is mixed. No soda or cream of tartar 
should go into sponge cake, as they make it dry. The 
lemon is very essential, not only for the flavor, but to make 
it light. The oven should be pretty hot. 

We give Mrs. Welch's process as differing from our own, 
and doubtless giving a little variety to the combination: 
Beat both yolks and whites very thoroughly; blend them 
lightly and quickly together; add the sugar gradually, 
then the lemon juice and rind and salt, and lastly the flour. 
Do not beat it after the flour is added. Bake in a moder- 
ate oven. 

535 Delicious Sp3nge Cake. 

Yolks of nineteen eggs, fifteen ounces of sugar, eight 
ounces of corn starch, whites of nine eggs, one teaspoonful

very smooth, then very gradually the corn starch, and 
lastly the well-beaten whites. Butter the pan for baking 
the cake, sift or sprinkle finely rolled cracker crumbs over 
the butter, pour in the cake, which, with this mauageriient, 
will never stick. 

536 Hot Sponge Cake.

proportion of one teaspoonful to one cup of water, with 
vrhich wet the baking-pan, on which the mixture is to be 
dropped in rourid places the size of a cream cake. Bake 
twenty minutes in a hot oven; avoid opening the oven 
door while baking. When cool, open them on one side 
and fill with the following mixture: One cup of sugar, 
one-half cup of flour, two eggs and one pint of milk. Beat 
the eggs, sugar and flour together and stir them into the 
milk while it is boiling, stirring constantly until it thick- 
ens. When it is cold flavor to suit the taste. We like 
extract of nectarine.

553 Sucker Kuchen (Sugar Cake.) 

Take bread dough, as large as a good-sized loaf; one pint 
of milk, a small cup of butter, two handfuls of sugar, and 
a teaspoonful of cinnamon. Mix the butter in the milk, 
on the stove; make a hole in the dough, put in the sugar 
and two eggs; then add the warm milk and butter, mix 
well, add flour enough to make a light dough; let it rise 
again. Roll it out one and one-half inches thick; put in a 
dripping pan; beat light one egg and spread it over the 
top; lay on pieces of butter, raisins and chopped almonds, 
and sifted cinnamon and sugar on the top. Bake in a hot 
oven fifteen or sixteen minutes. 

554 Berlin Haffee Zuchen. 

One pound of light raised dough, one ounce of sugar and 
three of butter, one egg; cream the butter and beat well 
with the sugar and the egg; add the dough and mix thor- 
oughly with the hand; put it in a warm place to rise; when 
light pour it in a small dripping-pan (when baked it should 
not be more than two-thirds of an inch thick), and let it 
stand ten or fifteen minutes; put in the oven, and while 
baking prepare the icing. Blanch two dozen almonds and 
shred them; add to the beaten whites of two eggs about 
half the usual quantity of sugar, stir in the almonds, and 
when the cake is baked cover it with the icing and let dry 
in the mouth of the oven. The almonds may brown a 
little if liked.

pan to rise, when light have melted some butter and sugar, 
cover the top of the cake and sprinkle over it thickly 
ground cinnamon. Omit the raisins and currants for ordi- 
nary use. 

556 Gold and Silver Cake. 

A simple but good recipe. One-half cup butter, one cup 
sugar, one and one-half cups of sifted flour, one-half cup of 
sweet milk, one and one-half teaspoons baking powder, 
vanilla for flavoring, whites of four eggs; beat the butler 
and sugar to a cream, then add the flour and milk, then the 
flavoring, and lastly the whites of eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. The golden cake made the same, only substituting 
the yolks for whites, and lemon for vanilla flavoring. This 
makes two nice loaves, and is a really delicious cake. 

557 Currant Short Cake— Good. 

We like better than strawberry. String and sugar a 
quart of currants, take a quart of flour, mix well in it a large 
tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of Snowflake 
baking powder, and a little salt; add milk enough to make 
a soft biscuit dough, roll it out three-quarters of an inch 
thick, and put it into dripping-pans eight by twelve inches, 
as this is a good size to cut. Bake immediately, when 
partially done, brush over with milk, and the moment it is 
baked, turn out on to a platter, and with your carving 
knife open right through the center; spread well with but- 
ter the top and bottom crust, then put in your currants, 
strawberries or raspberries, sprinkle some more sugar over, 
put on the top crust, and return to the oven for ten min- 
utes to soak. 

We consider sweet cream essential for eating with these 
short cakes, but many people do not mind its absence.

Strawberry short cake is made as above, except that you 
mash one-half the strawberries and leave the other half

lemon, the three whites beaten to a stiff froth, one heaping 
teacup of sifted flour, into which a teaspoonful of baking 
powder has been well mixed; stir the flour in very slowly,

583 To Prepare the Yeast for Doughnuts. 

Take from the-potato pot at dinner time, two good-sized 
boiled potatoes, two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour, and a 
teacupful of the scalding potato water; mash and beat the 
whole smooth. Add a tablespoonful of white sugar and 
set it by till lukewarm, then add a Twin Brother yeast 
cake, and let it ferment from two till eight or nine o'clock 
p. M. 

584 Cup Measure Doughnuts. 

One cup of lukewarm milk, four tablespoonfuls of butter, 
three eggs beaten light, half a nutmeg grated, a pinch of 
salt, half a teacup of yeast, as above, and one quart of 
flour; let rise over night. Mold up at 9 a. m. with as little 
flour as possible; set near the stove till 2 p.m., and fry. 
This receipt is excellent without yeast, substituting two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, or one of bicarbonate of 
soda, and two of cream of tartar. 

585 Baised Doughnuts. 

Three-quarters of a pound of butter, one and one-half

add the yeast and more flour; set it to rise over night. 

In the morning roll out and cut into diamond shapes or 
twists, lay them on the paste-board, set them in a warm 
place, let them rise/Jagain until very' light, say till two or 
three o'clock p.m.; then drop them into hot lard, turn them 
over in the pot once, promptly but not hurriedly. Should 
the lard incline to burn, throw in an apple skin, or a pared 
potato, which will clear it of any scorching propensity.

-586 Delightful Raised Doughnuts. 

Beat one egg very light, in one cup of sugar; add one 
tablespoonful of butter (sweet lard will do as well), and 
work it in one quart of raised dough; roll out, cut in fancy 
strips and fry in boiling lard. Doughnuts are much lighter 
and nicer if let rise before adding the eggs and sugar. 
Nice and easy as these doughnuts are, we regret to say 
they dry in two days. 

587 Queen of Doughnuts. 

One-half pound of butter, one tablespoonful of lard, 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar, five eggs, one and one- 
half pints of milk and one coffee-cupful of home-made

fuls of melted butter or lard, and a teaspoonful of salt. 
Beat four eggs with six heaping tablespoonfuls of rolled 
sugar, work them into the rest of the ingredients, together 
with a grated nutmeg, add flour to make them stiff enough 
to roll out easily. They should be rolled out about half an 
inch thick, cut with a jagging-iron or knife in strips about 
half an inch wide, and twisted so as to form small cakes 
Heat two pounds of lard in a deep kettle; the fat should boil 
up as the cakes are put in, and they should be constantly 
watched while frying. When brown on the under side turn 
them; when brown on both sides they are sufficiently done.

salt to a level spoonful of pepper); tben lay two slices 
gently togetber. Tbis sandwich may also be varied by 
grating a layer of cold smoked tongue or bam over tbe egg 
on one slice and not on tbe otber. Tbese require a ligbt 
and dexterous band to keep tbe egg from being crushed. 

593 Sardine Sandwiches. 

Open a can of sardines, remove the skin and bones, lay 
bits of the fish on well-spread bread and butter; squeeze 
lemon over it; lay a slice of buttered bread on top.

595 Egg Sandwiches (Children's School Lunches). 

Beat three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of milk, saltspoon 
of salt, and a dash of pepper; fry it as you would a griddle 
cake, and lay between buttered bread or biscuit, or slice 
hard-boiled eggs or cut rissole balls or nice stewed cod- 
fish left cold, and lay between slices of bread and butter. 

596 Potted Ham and Tongue Sandwiches. 

It is well to keep an unopened can of each in the house, 
and then it is ready for any emergency that may arise. 
Spread a thin layer on well-buttered bread, and fold to- 
gether. 

59 7 Oyster Sandwiches. 

Chop raw oysters very fine, season with pepper, salt, a 
little nutmeg, and four crackers pounded and sifted; the 
white of an egg beaten, cream and butter. When all is 
mixed, heat them over steam in an oat-meal boiler, or over 
the fire until a smooth paste; set them away to get very 
cold, cut and lay between buttered slices of bread. A 
quart of solid meats, a half teacup of melted butter, the 
same of rich cream, whites of three eggs and eight crack- 
ers. Pie paste biscuit, with slices of oyster sandwiches, 
are nicer than bread and butter. 

598 Tongue or Ham Sandwiches. 

Chop fine the lean of cold boiled tongue or ham, season 
with prepared mustard and black pepper. Add melted 
butter and sweet cream until smooth like a paste, then 
spread between buttered slices of bread. A teaspoonful of 
Worcester or Harvey sauce to every pint gives a pleasant 
flavor. 



212 BREAKFAST AND TEA RELISHES. 

599 To Carry Sandwiches. 

A nice and dainty way of carrying delicate sandwiches, 
such as oysters, lobsters or egaj, is to make little bagi* of 
tissue paper. There is a rather strong white tissue paper 
that can usually be got for this purpose. Put one or two 
sandwiches into each bag. They can be folded in papers, 
such as come for paper napkins. On all pic-nics it is a 
good plan to carry one or two substantial towels. 

600 Small Roll with Salad rilling. 

Cut off the end of a French roll, remove the inside 
crumb, prepare a filling of cold tongue, chicken and celery, 
that have been mixed with a mayonnaise dressing; cover 
the top with the piece that was taken off. 

601 Pried Cream 

Makes a rather nice pic-nic dish eaten cold. 



BREAKFAST AND TEA RELISHES. 



603 Bichamelle or Minced Veal. 

Mince your cold roast veal fine in a chopping-bowl, leav- 
ing out the stringy part; put into your frying-pan a tea- 
cupful (or more as the quantity requires) of milk or sweet 
cream, into which stir, when hot, a teaspoonful of butter 
and one of flour, braided together; then add your veal 
heat it thoi'oughly through, grate a little nutmeg, or 
sprinkle fine mace over it, and pour it into a dish that 
has a border of puff paste leaves spread around it (you 
can make your leaves when you are making pies, and just 
heat them in the oven a moment); then squeeze the juice 



BREAKEAST AND TEA RELISHES. 213 

of a lemon over the top of the minced veal, laying five or 
six leaves of paste on it, and serve. This was from old 
Mammy Wood, and is delicious for breakfast. Yon can 
make veal patties of it by grating cold ham over it and 
then inclosing it in a paste and baking it. 

603 Ciopped Beef. 

Take t\yo pounds of the round of beef, chop raw, heat 
the spider, put in a small piece of butter; add meat, season 
with salt and pepper, add a large spoonful of flour, then 
pour in a cup of milk or stock; season well. 

604: Beef Collops. 

A pound and a half of lean beef, chopped into square 
pieces the size of a large bean; put a tablespoon of butter 
into your frying-pan and pour the meat into the boiling 
butter; cook through, stirring frequently; add at the last 
a teaspoonful of brown flour, a little water, pepper, salt, 
and a tablespoonful of vinegar. 

605 Hash. 

This dish by any other name might make a moi'e wel- 
come impression. Oar receipt is for a sweet and whole- 
some breakfast relish. Take two pint bowls of cold roast 
beef, or corned beef, chop it quite fine, then chop double 
the quantity of potatoes much coarser; put into a frying- 
pan a tablespoonful of butter, and a scant teacup of stock 
or boiling water; let it boil up, put the hashed meat and 
potatoes into it and stir it from time to time, till the liquid 
dries away and leaves a skin on the bottom of the pan. 



214 BREAKFAST AND TEA EELISHES. 

606 Hashed Mutton 

Is not pleasant with potatoes. Chop the mutton fine, 
put some gravy into your pan, heat the meat very thor- 
oughly through, and pour it on well buttered slices of 
toast. 

607 Corned Beef to Serve Cold, 

Mrs. Henderson gives a receipt of her friend, Mrs. Gratz 
Brown, that we know will prove useful. If your corned 
beef is very salt, soak it an hour or more in cold water, 
then put it over the fire, cover with fresh cold water, four 
or five cloves for each six pounds of beef, and three table- 
spoonfuls of molasses; in an hour cliange the water, add 
another five cloves and three more tablespoonfuls of molas- 
ses. In two hours more press the beef into a colander and 
put a flat-iron or any heavy weight upon the cloth you 
spread over it; let it stand all day. 

608 Dried Beef— Breakfast Dish. 

Here is another nice breakfast dish. Take about half a 
pound di'ied beef; first slice thin, then pulled in small 
pieces. Have a quart of milk boiling, into which put the 
beef with a good piece of butter and a little pepper. When 
it comes to a boil, thicken with a little flour or corn starch, 
then toast bread, a slice for each member of the family, 
and poach in hot water an equal number of eggs; place one 
on each slice of tosist; put all on a large platter, and pour 
over the above dressing and send to the table hot; lean 
ham may be used in the place of the beef. 

609 Persilade. 

Cut any nice cold meat in very thin slices; take two 
tablespoonfuls of finely chopped parsley, one small onion; 
then beat two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful 



BREAKFAST AND TEA RELISHES. 215

egar or tarragon vinegar improves this; pour this over 
the slices half an hour before serving. 

610 Stewed Kidney. 

Soak and then parboil the'^^kidney, cut it off in inch pieces, 
roll in flour, add butter the size of an egg, and water 
enough to stew till tender; add, of you like it, a tablespoon 
ful of mushroom catsup, or walnut pickle vinegar. 

611 Liver. 

Cut a calf's liver into half-inch slices, dredge them with 
flour, lay them on a gridiron and broil slightly; then put 
them into a frying-pan with a tablespoonful of butter or 
some slices of bacon, and fry for a few moments; cut the 
slices of liver into pieces the width of your finger; add a 
tablespoonful of flour, brown and add water; stew ten 
minutes. 

612 Spanish Toast. 

Beat three eggs to a foam, toast a few slices of bakers' 
bread; dip them in the egg and fry to a light brown. 

613 To Make Milk Toast. 

First toast nice slices of stale bread {i. e., one or two days 
old) ; put in a saucepan or spider a quart of milk, with a 
piece of butter the size of an egg, a little salt and pepper. 
When the milk and butter are hot, but not quite boiling, 
dip your slices one by one and lay them in your tureen. 
When all are dipped just enough to moisten, but not break 
them, set your saucepan where it will come to a boil. 
Have ready a large tablespoonful of flour, made smooth 
with milk, and as soon as the milk boils stir it in till it is

thickened. Turn it over the toast, raising the slices a little 
so that all may receive a share. This for a family of four 
or five. A richer toast is made by buttering the slice of 
toast and adding a quarter of a pound of butter to the 
milk instead of the flour. 

614 Pressed Beef. 

Three pounds round steak, raw, chopped fine, six crackers 
rolled fine, thi'ee eggs beaten, one-half nutmeg, two small 
teaspoons of pepper and a little more salt, one cup of water. 
Put into a small-sized bread-pan and bake till tender when 
tried with a fork; baste frequently with the dripping from 
the beef. The original receipt calls for three hours' baking, 
but less can be given with judgment. 

615 Beef Loaf. 

Two pounds of steak and one pound of fat pork, chopped 
fine, two and-a-half cups of rolled crackers, five eggs, two 
teaspoons of pepper, two teaspoons of salt; mix all together

dissolved in one-half pint of water; one teacup of browned 
veal gravy, one pint of liquor in which the tongue was 
boiled, one tablespoonful of burnt sugar for coloring, three 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one pint of boiling water; put 
together the gravy, liquor, sugar, vinegar and a tablespoon- 
ful of burnt sugar dissolved in cold water. Add the dis- 
solved gelatine and mix well, then the boiling water, and 
strain through flannel. Cut the tongue in slices as for the 
table. Let the jelly cool and begin to thicken. Wet a 
mold with cold water, put a little jelly in the bottom, then 
a layer of the tongue, more jelly, and so on until the mold 
is full; cover and set in a cool place. To turn it out set 
the mold in hot water for an instant, invert upon a dish 
and garnish with celery sprigs and nasturtion flowers. Cut 
with a sharp knife perpendicularly. This is a handsome 
and delicious dish, and easily made.

CHEESE. 

629 Cheese Fondu. 

One cup of bread crumbs, very dry and fine; two scant 
cups of milk, rich and fresh, or it will curdle; one-half 
pound of dry old cheese, grated; three eggs, whipped light, 
one small tablespoonful of melted butter, pepper and salt, 
one pinch of soda dissolved in hot water, and stirred into 
the milk; soak the crumbs in the milk; beat in these ihe 
eggs and butter, seasoning, lastly the cheese; butter a 
baking-dish, pour the fondu into it, strew dry bread crumbs 
on the top, and bake in a rather quick oven until delicately 
browned. Serve immediately in the baking-dish, or it 
soon falls. 

630 English Welch Earebit. 

One-quarter of a pound of cheese, yolks of two eggs, 
five ounces of grated biead, a quarter of a pound of butter, 
one tablespoonful of mustard, a little salt. Mix with a 
quarter of a pound of grated cheese, five ounces of bread 
crumbs, and a quarter of a pound of good butter. Add a 
tablespoonful of raufetard and a little salt. Mix all well 
together, and then beat it smooth in a mortar. Lay the 
mixture neatly on slices of toasted bread, and place them 
in a Dutch oven before the fire to become thoroughly hot 
and slightly brown. Placing a thick white paper over the 
dish until hot, and then removing it, prevents the cheese 
from becoming brown or dry. Time, ten minutes. 

N. B. — This receipt is from Warne's celebrated book. 
Our method adds to this half a teacup of milk, and gives 
it a thorough heating in a frying-pan, then pour it on toast.

632 The Very Best Brine for Cucumber Pickles. 

Five gallons of water, three quarts of salt, one pound 
alum, heat and skim well. When cool add one gallon of 
good vinegar. This will make brine for half a barrel of 
pickles. For smaller quantity, take ten quarts water, three 
pints salt, one-half pound alum, two quarts vinegar. I 
will warrant that your pickles will keep hard and good. 

N. B. — We highly recommend this brine; it is by far 
the best we have ever used. In the autumn we make a 
live-gallon jug of this and have it ready for every sort of 
pickle. You may leave pickles in it six months and then 
do them up. 

633 Cucumber Pickles. 

To a hundred good sized cucumbers, put a cup of barrel 
salt; pour on boiling water enough to cover them; cover 
tightly to keep the steam in; let them stand twenty-four 
hours; take them out, drain and wipe them dry, being care- 
ful not to break the skins; put them in the vessel in which 
they are to be kept, heat enough pure cider vinegar to 



PICKLES AND CATSUP. 223 

cover tbera. For every three hundred pickles take one 
ounce of allspice, one of cinnamon, one of mustard seedj 
use them whole. Boil the viueger and spices together; 
while boiling pour it on the pickles and cover tightly. Let 
them stand three weeks and they are ready to eat. Mother 
used to put alura in them. Sometimes I put in wild grapes 
and a large piece of horse-radish; this gives the vinegar 
something to live on; also put in a few string beans, onions 
and cauliflower. These pickles will keep for years, and we 
have used the recipe in the family for forty years. 

N. B. — This recipe answers admirably for the pickles 
which have been kept in the salt, alura and vinegar brine. 

634 Cucumber Pickles— Mr. H. M. D.'s Favorites. 

I usually freshen four quarts of cucumbers at one time, 
and when sufiiciently fresh scald them in weak vinegar, 
with a lump of alum the size of a hickory nut dissolved in 
it; let them stand in it twenty-four hours, then drain it all 
off. I then take enough sharp cider vinegar to cover 
them; add a coffeecup three times even full of brown 
sugar, five or six sticks of cinnamon, let it heat slowly, and 
when boiling pour over the cucumbers and cover tightly. 
If when you come to use them you should find them not 
quite suited to your taste, you can remedy this by heating 
the vinegar over, and adding more sugar as you see fit. 
Have tried the above receipt and find it better than any I 
have ever used before. Do not be afraid of the quantity 
of sugar used; it is just right if your vinegar is sharp 
enough. The one kind of spice is better than different ones, 
as we usually use them. — Fannib P. D. 

N. B. — The sugar in the above receipt does not seem to 
taste, but nevertheless we omit it in our household. It 
makes a different, but none the less delightful, pickle.

'635 Sliced Cucumber Pickles. 

Twelve large cucumbers, six small onions, salt, half tea- 
cup salad oil or more, half cup black mustard seed, one 
tablespoonful celery seed and one quart of vinegaj". Slice 
cucumbers thin with the skin on, onions same. Place al- 
ternate layers of cucumbers and onions in a deep dish,

Mrs. Gertrude M. D'Land. 

636 Tomato Catsup (Best in the World). 

Take sound ripe tomatoes, slice and cook until done 
enough to pass through a sieve; then to every gallon of the 
tomato pulp and juice add one teacupful chopped onion, 
one half cup black peppei", four pods red pepper cut fine, 
one-half teacup ground ginger and dry mustard (English), 
mixed, one ounce celery seed, one-half teacup allspice, nut- 
meg and cinnamon mixed, one-half teaspoonful of cloves, 
two teacupf uls of sugar and sufficient salt to taste distinctly, 
one pint strong cider vinegar. Put all on together and cook 
two hours, or longer it not thick enough. It must not be 
thin or watery. Bottle and seal while hot, and in a cool 
cellar it will keep for years. Spices should all be the best. 
Do not use the ground spices purchased from druggists, as 
they ai'e not strong enough. 

637 Cucumber Catsup. 

Late in September take a bushel of full-grown cucum- 
bers, peel and slice them, sprinkle them with salt, and let 
them stand over a sieve two hours, that the salt may drain 
•off, then chop them fine. Add two dozen onions cut up 



PICKLES AND CATSUP. 225 

small, one pound of white mustard seed, one pound of 
black mustard, one-fourth of a pound of black pepper, 
ground. Mix all together very thoroughly with the best 
vinegar, making it the consistency of a thick catsup, and 
fill your jars, tying up closely. It requires no cooking. 

638 Plum Catsup. 

To three pounds of fruit put one and three-quarter 
pounds of sugar, one tablespoonful of cloves, one table- 
spoonful of cinnamon, one tablespoonful of pepper, and 
very little salt. Scald the plums and put them through a 
colander, then boil until about the same consistency as the 
tomato catsup. 

639 White Pickle. 

Two quarts of vinegar, one-quarter of a pound of ground 
mustard, one-quarter pound of white mustard seed, two 
ounces of black mustard seed, one teaspoonf ul of root ginger, 
one teaspoonf ul of celery seed; tarragon and mace to taste; 
green and red pepper to taste; a lemon or two cut into this 
quantity improves the flavor, as also does a root of horse- 
radish. Scald the vinegar befoi'e adding the above ingre- 
dients, and pour all, when cold, over sliced green tomatoes 
that have stood in salt one day and scalded. It is equally 
good over beans, cucumbers, etc. 

640 Mustard Pickle. 

Fill a three-gallon jar with small green tomatoes, cucum- 
bers, nasturtions, onions, cauliflowers, horse-radish, and a 
few small green peppers. Let them stand in salt and water 
twenty-four hours. Drain off this water. Put the mixtui-e 
in a brass or porcelain kettle with fresh water, and boil ten 
minutes; then drain thoroughly, and put back in the jar.

226 PICKLES AND CATSUP. 

Boil three quarts of vinegar, adding three-fourtha pound 
mustard wet with cold vinegar. When it thickens pour 
over the pickle. 

64:1 Sweet Pickle. 

Take one peck of good solid green tomatoes, and onions 
to suit the taste and fancy (five quarts of tomatoes and 
three of onions), peel the onious as for boiling, wash and 
dry the tomatoes, cut them in thin lices, cut in small 
pieces six large green peppers, carefully leaving out the 
seeds; put the slices in a large pan and sprinkle a pint of 
fine salt on them; let them stand about twenty-four hours; 
drain off all the liquor, carefully pressing down the cover; 
when they are suflBciently drained, put in the preserving 
kettle and cover well with vinegar, prepared thus: Ten or 
twelve ounces brown sugar to the quart, a tablespoonful 
each of ground cinnamon and cloves, and a spoonful of 
crushed white mustard seed; boil well about fifteen minutes 
and put in pots or jars. 

642 Picked Mangces. 

Young musk or nutmeg melons, English mustard seed, 
two handfuls mixed with one handful scraped horse-radish, 
mace and nutmeg pounded, one teaspoonful, two tea- 
spoonfuls chopped garlic, a little ginger, one dozen whole 
pepper-corns, half a tablespoonful of ground mustard to a 
pint of the mixture, one tablespoonful sugar to the same 
quantity, one tablespoonful best salad oil to the same, one 
teaspoonful celery seed: cut a slender piece out of the 
melon, save it to replace. Lay the mangoes in strong brine 
for three days, drain off the brine, and freshen in pure 
water twenty-four hours, green as you would cucumbers, 
and lay in cold water until cold and firm, fill with the 



PICKLES AND CATSUP. 227 

stuffing; tie up with packthread; pack in a deep stone jar 
and pour scalding vinegar over them, repeat this process 
three times more at intervals of tAvo days, then tie up and 
set away in a cool, dry place; these are very fine; they 
will keep for months. I use nothing but white wine 
vinegar. Pepper mangoes can be fixed in the same way. 

643 Mustard Pickels. 

Two large heads of cauliflower, six heads celery, six 
white beets. Clean them and boil separately in salt and 
water until tender. The tender part of the celery is not 
to be boiled, but cut fine; use just water enough to cover. 
Mix one-half pound of ground English mustard with vinegar, 
as for table use, and boil five minutes; then add two 
bottles of best French mustard ( or one pint of German 
mustard ) and boil five minutes longer, adding vinegar 
enough to cover your pickles, and one tablespoon ful of 
brown sugar. If not salt enough add to your taste. Pour 
over the pickles boiling hot. As the pickles are used 
there will be a good deal of the mustard-vinegar left, and 
small cucumbers can then be put in, or small onions; the 
latter boiled a few minutes in salt water. This pickle 
keeps a long time and is very fine. Any vegetables liked 
can be substituted for cauliflower and white beets. 

644 Mustard Chow Chow. 

One quart small cucumbers, one quai't large cucumbers 
cut small, two quarts small onions, one quart small green 
tomatoes, one quart green tomatoes cut up, three good 
sized heads cauliflower, six green peppers cut in strips, half 
pound English mustard, one ounce turmeric powder, six 
cups sugar, two cups flour. Make a paste of these, and 



228 PICKLES AND CATSUP. 

stir into one gallon of vinegar, boiling hot. Soak the veg- 
etables separately in a weak salt water brine over night. 
After draining, put into the scalding vinegar that you 
have prepared; cook very little, and put into cans. 

Mrs. Lapham. 
N. B. — This is an admirable receipt, except that as my 
family disliked the sugar I omitted it. 

645 Chow-Chow. 

Take fifty small pickles, two quarts of silver onions, two 
quarts of green string beans, one dozen green tomatoes, 
three heads of cauliflower; let the onions stand in brine 
twelve hours, then peel. Jf the beans are large, break 
them. Slice the green tomatoes, cut up the cauliflowers; 
let all stand in brine twenty-four hours. To one gallon of 
vinegar use one pound of mustard (common ia the best), 
mix it with a little vinegar, and add it to the rest. One or 
two tablespoonfuls of oil of mustard, one tablespoonful of 
cayenne pepper — use more spices if preferred. Tie the 
spices in a white cloth, and boil in the vinegar, before 
adding the mustard. It can be put in preserve jars in 
alternate layers; fill three-quarters full; when filling the 
jars add here and there a little red and green pepper ; fill 
up with the mustard; make air-tight, 

646 Filled Peppers.— Very Nice. 

Cut the lids off two dozen large green peppers, take out 
seeds and soak in salt water over night; slice fine a cabbage, 
mix with it one ounce white mustard seed and one ounce 
cloves, fill the peppers and tie the lids on; cover with cold 
boiled cider vinegar.

raace, one teaspoonful of cloves; cover with vinegar. 
Grated horse-radish may be added, if liked. 

648 Yellow Pickle. 

Two gallons strong cider vinegar, one pint black jtius- 
tard seed, four ounces ginger, three ounces black pepper, 
three ounces allspice, one ounce celery seed, one ounce tur- 
meric, four lemons sliced, a few cloves, garlic, say a handful, 
two pounds sugar, handful horse-radish. Bruise all the 
spices and put them with the other ingredients in a jar and 
pour on the vinegar cold. Tie up, but stir every day until 
the pickles are ready to put in this liquor. Take several 
small heads of cabbage, wash, quarter and put in strong- 
brine; let them lie in it twenty-four hours well covered, 
take out, rinse in cold water, put in a preserving kettle 
with sufficient vinegar to cover and add one ounce turmeric; 
scald, but by no means suffer to boil, cover with a plate or 
pan to keep the steam in; let the pickle lie in the same 
vinegar twenty-four hours, take out and drop in that pre- 
pared above. This spiced liquor is good to use with green 
pickles, leaving out the turmeric, and universally pro- 
nounced excellent and a favorite Southern receipe. 

649 Peach Pickle. 

To seven pounds of fruit take one quart of vinegar, three 
pounds of sugar, one teaspoonful of ground cloves and one 
of cinnamon (tied in a muslin bag), rub the peaches clean 
of their downy coat, prick them with a fork, and put them, 
a few at a time, into the spiced vinegar. Let them cook 
till they are tender. Put them into jars, as taken out, and 
pour the vinegar over them. 

This is equally good for plums, quinces, or any other fruit.

650 Sweet Pickled Peaches. 

Rub the fur off with a coarse cloth, stick three cloves in 
each peach, four pounds of sugar to a quart of vinegar, 
boil and skim, put in the peaches and boil until you can 
run a stem into them, then take them out, put in a jar, 
pour the vinegar over hot, cover immediately. These are 
very fine. The peaches must be hard ones; the yellow are 
the best. 

651 Pickled Apples— Very Nice. 

Two pounds of dried apples, one quart of good viqegar, 
one cup sugar, a little spice and cloves. Soak tlie apples 
all night, in the morning put water enough on them to cook 
until tender. Boil vinegar, sugar and spices, then put in 
the apples, boil once and you have a good dish for dinner 
sauce. 

652 Chili Sauce. 

Take twenty-five large ripe tomatoes, ten large onions, 
ten red peppers, five tablespoonf uls salt, five white sugar, 
five cups of vinegar; peel the tomatoes and chop all fine; 
boil slowly till well cooked; bottle and seal, or put in 
Mason jars.

poured over the rinds (boiling hot) three days in succession. 

655 Pickled Onions. 

Use the small silver skinned onions, remove with a knife 
all the outer skins, so that the onions look fresh. Pour 
over them a scalding hot brine made in the proportion of 
one cup of salt to one quart of water; let stand three days, 
take up, rinse with cold water and pour on scalding hot 
vinegar, spiced with stick cinnamon, mace and cayenne 
pepper, or if the pure onion flavor is preferred, simply boil 
red or green peppers in the vinegar. If the onions seem 
hard and raw, scald the vinegar again; let the onions scald 
in it from five to fifteen minutes; bottle and cork. 

656 Eed Cabbage. 

Choose fine firm heads of red cabbage, remove the outer 
leaves, cut in quarters and pickle in quartei-s, or slice very 
fine with a knife or cabbage cutter; sprinkle thoroughly 
with fine salt and pack in a large sieve or colander ; let it 
drain for twenty-four hours, then pack in a jar pour over 
scalding hot vinegar strongly spiced with nutmeg, cloves 
and pepper. 

657 Tomato Relish.

until soft; strain all through a sieve, then add three pounds 
of sugar, one ounce of nutmeg, one tablespoonful of cloves, 
two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, and boil one hour. 

662 Spiced Fruit. 

For Currants. Damson Plums, Gooseberries, Wild 
Grapes, Old-fashioned Sour Cherries — five pounds of fruit, 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 238 

four coffee cups of sugar (light brown), one teacup of vin- 
egar, one heaping tablespoonful each of cloves and cinna- 
mon, one even tablespoonful of allspice; mix the vinegar, 
sugar and spices well together; add the fruit and boil one 
hour, stirring up constantly. — Cousin Annie Dwight, 

663 To Make Good Table Vinegar. 

When peeling apples, fill a two gallon jar with the skins, 
stems and cores; pour boiling water over them and let 
them stand behind the kitchen stoA^e till cool or lukewarm; 
then add half a pint (or a pint) of molasses and a teacup 
of quick yeast, and stir the whole well together; let it 
stand near the kitchen fire three or four weeks, and when 
well fermented strain and pour into a jug; it will make 
fine table vinegar. 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 



Canning Fruit. — Those who have to buy the fruit they 
put up, as well as the cans, may perhaps purchase to ad- 
vantage of the wholesale grocer, but where one has 
abundance of fruit for the picking, and can give the time 
and trouble, there is certainly a saving in putting up the 
family supplies of fruit one's self. The cheapest way of 
getting cans is to buy them of the manufactui'er, and thus 
save the profits of middlemen. The fruit should be per- 
fectly fresh, and the sooner it is canned after it is taken 
from the tree or vine the better. If a small quantity, say 
half a dozen quarts, is cooked at one time the color of the 
fruit and the uniformity of the cooking will be better than 
if a larger quantity is attempted. There is no necessity of 



234 PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 

using an ounce of sugar in a gross of cans. Tlie fruit will 
keep just as well without it, and be far more grateful to a 
healthy appetite. Glass cans with glass tops, a rubber 
band and a screw ring give the best satisfaction, as they 
can be sealed and unsealed in a moments' time. As for 
the process, when the fruit is done, pour it screeching hot 
into the cans; let them remain untouched fifteen or twenty 
minutes, till the fruit settles, then fill them full again and 
seal up. If the can is placed on a very wet cloth it will 
not break when the scalding fruit is put into it. Turn the 
cans, after screwing them up tightly, bottom side up, and 
if no syrup leaks out no air can get in. When cold set 
them away in a dark cool closet. 

■664: Worth Knowing. 

In canning f ruit,take a thick cloth (or one folded in several 
thicknesses), wring it out in hot water and lay it on a table. 
On this set the bottles for filling, and you may pour in the 
boiling fruit with impunity, thus avoiding the discomfort 
of standing over a hot stove during the process, handling 
heated bottles. If the cloth becomes sticky wring it out 
again. Some persons think a dry cloth answers the same 
purpose, but we prefer the wet one. 

665 To Prevent Mildew on Preserves. 

Take the white of an egg and wet slightly both sides of 
a piece of letter paper, sufficiently large to cover over the 
top of the preserves snugly. I have kept them free from 
mold and spoiling two years. 

666 Currant Jelly (Perfect). 

This receipt is the only one which we will warrant to 
make good jelly against odds. We have made jelly by it 
on the 5th of July, and on the 19th, and each time it was 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 235 

a perfect success. While we recommend all persons to 
make their jelly from fresh fruit early in the season, we 
can still assure those who ai-e behindhand that they need 
not despair of jelly that will set firm and hard later in the 
season. 

Run the currants through your hand, picking out the 
leaves, and any stray thing that may adhere to them, but 
leaving the currants on their stems. Weigh the fruit, 
being accurate in writing down the number of pounds. 
Put a pint of water into your preserving kettle, and add a 
bowl or two of currants, mashing and pressing them till 
you have sufficient juice to cover the bottom of the kettle, 
then add the remainder of the currants; let them come to 
a boil,and boil at least twenty minutes,of course stirring and 
pressing them from time to time that every berry may be 
broken up and that they may not burn. Have a three- 
cornered bag of thin, but strong, unbleached cotton, that 
has been well scalded and wrung till almost dry; hang it 
up and pour the boiled currants into it. Let it drip into 
a stone crock all night, but by no means squeeze it; the 
currants will drain perfectly dry. In the morning pour 
the strained juice into the preserving kettle, without 
measuring; let it come to a boil, and boil thoroughly for 
three or four minutes, then pour in half as many pounds 
of sugar as you had pounds of currants. For instance, a 
peck of currants will probably weigh twelve pounds, there- 
fore use six pounds of sugar. The moment the sugar is 
entirely dissolved and the jelly begins to set on your silver 
ladle, that is, as you pour it off from the ladle the last 
few drops will fall in flakes that are no longer liquid, the 
jelly is nearly, if not quite ready to remove from the stove. 
From the time you pour the sugar in the boiling juice to 
the removal of the jelly from the fire does not vary much 



236 PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 

from twenty-five minutes. Allowance must be made for 
the quantity of jelly, and the heat of the fire; be the same 
more or less. 

667 Currant Jelly.— A Boston Receipt (Mrs. L.) 

Take out leaves, leave stems on; put one peck of cur- 
rants in a kettle with two quarts of water, or water till 
you can just see it throui^h the currants; boil till fruit is 
tender, turn the fruit into a sieve or colander to drip; 
measure juice and return to kettle, boil ten minutes; while 
boiling add one pound or pint of sugar to one pound or pint 
of juice, and follow the instructions given in the foregoing 
receipt. 

668 Crab-Apple Jelly. 

Place the fruit whole in water enough to cover it an 
inch over the top and boil perfectly soft, then pour the 
contents of the kettle into a coarse cheese-cloth or cotton 
bag and suspend it on a strip of narrow board laid across 
the backs of two chairs, with a crock under it, and leave it 
all night, or until it ceases to drip. Then press it a very 
little. Allow a pound of sugar to a pint of the juice — if 
you choose, add the juice of a lemon to every quart of 
syrup. Boil the juice first and skim it; heat the sugar in 
a dish in the stove oven and add it as the syrup boils up. 
Let it scald, but not boil, twenty minutes from the time 
of putting in the sugar, and pour in tumblers or molds. 
In the jellying, follow the instructions given in Currant 
Jelly recipe. 

669 Cranberry Jelly. 

Cover the cranberries with water, and let boil for twenty 
or thirty minutes; break the berries and scald once more; 
then pour into a jelly bag, and let drip over night — do not 



PBESBKVING AND CANNING FKUIT. 237 

squeeze; weigh a pound of sugar to every pint of juice. 
Let the juice come to a boil and boil five minutes; then 
pour in the sugar and stir till thoroughly dissolved. This 
jelly will set without coming to a boil. It is also nice to 
stir the juice through a colander, instead of straining 
through a bag. 

670 Grape Jelly. 

Differs only from Currant Jelly recipe by boiling the 
grapes twenty minutes; bruising them meantime with a 
ladle or potato masher, until the juice runs freely, then 
strain through a sieve or thin cloth, and measure one pint 
for one pound of sugar. Boil the juice fifteen or twenty 
minutes before putting in the sugar; after adding the 
sugar let it scald from twenty to twent^'-five minutes, 
but never boil. 

All fruit will form more readily in a jelly if not quite 
ripe. 

€71 Apple Jelly. 

Core and quarter, but not pare, tart apples. Cook in a 
little more water than will cover them till well reduced, as 
in Crab-Apple Jelly. Strain, add one pound of sugar to 
one pint of the juice, scald twenty minutes or half an hour, 
and strain carefully into your molds. Slices of lemon or 
Jamaica ginger may be added to the apples while boiling, 

672 Pieplant Jelly. 

Pick the pieplant and wash, but do not peel it, cut iu 
strips, put in the kettle, add enough of water to cook until 
soft, strain the juice off and weigh, add sugar pound for 
pound; cook ten minutes, or as thick as you wish, and fol- 
low the rule for currant jelly. 



238 PBKSERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 

673 Orange Marmalade. 

Three pounds of oranges, two pounds of lemons, five 
pounds of sugar. 

Directions. — Peel the oranges and lemons, put the skins 
of both in tlie preserving pan, cover with water and cook 
till tender; then take them out, and put the pulps into the 
same water and cook from one to two hours, adding more 
water if it gets too thick; while the pulp is cooking cut the 
skins in strips as fine as possible; strain the pulp through a 
jelly bag, and put the juice back in the pan with the sugar; 
when it is dissolved put in the skins; boil about fifteen 
minutes, and it is ready to put in bowls. 

674 Raspberry Jam. 

One pound sugar to one pound berries. Boil three-quar- 
ters of an hour. Seal Avhile hot. 

675 Raspberry Vinegar, No. 1. 

Red raspberries, any quantity, or sufficient to fill a stone 
jar nearly full, then pour upon them enough vinegar to 
cover them, cover the jar closely and set it aside for eight 
or ten days, then strain through flannel or muslin and add 
to the clear liquor one and-a-half pounds of sugar to each 
pint; place over the fire and boil gently for a few minutes, 
then allow it to cool and bottle for use. This makes, when 
mixed with ice water, a delightful summer drink, or for 
sick persons. 

676 Raspberry Vinegar, Nc. 2. 

Twelve boxes of raspberries, one coffee-cup of vinegar, 
one pound of sugar to one pint of juice. After straining 
the juice add sugar and vinegar. Let it come to a boil. 
Bottle and seal while hot.

677 Preserved Citron Melon. 

Pare, core, and cut the melons into slices; weigh them, 
and to every six pounds of melon allow six pounds of white 
sugar, and the juice and yellow rind — pared off thin — of 
four lemons; also, half a pound of race ginger; put the 
slices into a preserving kettle, cover with water, and a 
layer on all of peach leaves; boil about half an hour, or 
until clear, and a broom-whisk will pierce them; drain 
them, spread them in a pan of cold water, and let them 
stand all night; next morning tie the ginger in a thin mus- 
lin cloth and boil it in three pints of water until the water 
is highly flavored; take out the ginger; dissolve the sugar 
in the ginger-water, put in the lemon peel and boll and 
skim it till no more scum rises; take out the lemon peel, 
put in the citron slices and juice of the lemon, and boil in 
the syrup till the slices are transparent and a straw will go 
through them; put the slices, while warm, in jars, and pour 
the syrup on slowly; cover closely with paper which the 
air cannot penetrate, or air-tight jars. 

678 To Preserve Citron for Cake Without its Being too 

Hard. 

Cut a citron and steam it, not too much; then melt your 
sugar, put the citron into it and cook as you would for 
preserves; dry it slowly in a wai'm oven; repeat this pro- 
cess several times. Flavor with lemon, if you choose; 
brown sugar is the best, if you wish to have it look dark. 
In order to have it moist and easy to cut care must be 
taken not to dry it too much. When ready to lay away 
sprinkle sugar over it and it will keep nicely. 

I have just preserved some citron for cake as above 
directed, and it is just as nice as any you will find on sale 
at fifty cents per pound.

679 Lemon Marmalade. 

Every housekeeper should keep a jar filled with brine, in 
which she may throw lemon peels after having used the 
grated rind and juice for creams, jellies, etc. These may 
remain any length of time. Before preserving, soak in 
pure water until all the taste of salt is extracted. Boil till 
soft enough to pierce with a straw. Put in a preserving 
kettle nine pounds of cut sugar and one quart of water; 
as soon as it boils add six pounds of lemon peel and three 
pounds of nice sliced apples (pippins are best); boil till 
very thick. 

'680 Lemon Conserves. 

Wash and dry ten lemons; pare the yellow rind off clear 
of the white, and beat it in a mortar, with double its weight 
of sugar. Pack closely in a jar and cover with part of the 
sugar. 

681 Lemon and Orange Syrnp. 

Put one and one-half pounds of white sugar to each pint 
of juice; add some peel and boil ten minutes; then strain 
and cork. It makes a fine beverage, and is useful for 
flavoring pies and puddings. The juice of any acid fruit 
may be used in the same way. 

682 Ripe Tomato Preserves. 

Seven pounds sound, yellow tomatoes, and six pounds of 
sugar; the juice of three large lemons. Let them all stand 
together over night; drain off the syrup and boil it, 
skimming well; then put in the tomatoes and .scald gently 
for twenty minutes; take out the tomatoes with the skim- 
mer and spread on dishes to cool. Boil down the syrup 
until it thickens; put the preserves in jars and fill up with 
hot syrup. 



PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT. 241 

683 Preserved Currants.— Very Nice. 

Ten pounds currants, seven pounds sugar; take the 
stems from seven pounds of the currants, and press the 
the juice from the other three pounds. When the juice 
and sugar are made into a hot syrup, put in the currants 
and boil until thick and rich. 

684: Preserved Quinces. 

Pare, quarter and core the fruit, saving skins and cores. 
Put the quinces over the fire with just enough water to 
cover them, and simmer until perfectly tender, but do not 
let tliem break. Take out the fruit and spread on dishes 
to cool. In another kettle have the paring and cores boil- 
ing in water enough to cover them; add this water to that 
in which the quinces were boiled, and cook on hour; then 
strain through a jelly bag, and to each pint of this liquor 
allow a pound of sugar. Boil and skim this, then put in 
the frnit and boil fifteen minutes. Take it off the fire and 
let it stand in a deep dish twenty-four hours. Then drain 
off the syrup, and let it boil again; put in the quinces and 
cook fifteen minutes. Take out the fruit and spread on 
dishes to cool; boil down the syrup thick; put the fruit in 
your jars until two-thirds full, then cover with the syrup. 

685 Apples for Tea. 

Pare a dozen or more apples, take out the core carefully 
and fill the center of each apple with sugar and a small 
lump of butter. Put them in a pan with half a pint of 
water; baste occasionally with the syrup while baking. 
When done serve with cream.

686 Grape Jam. 

Pick the grapes from the stem and wash them; after 
they are drained slip the pulp from the skin, keeping them 
in separate dishes; then boil the pulp until it will easily 
part from the seeds. Strain through a colander, rinsing 
the seed with a little water. Boil the skins (adding some 
water) until they are quite tender, and chop them fine. 
(The Isabella will not become as tender as other varieties.) 
Then put all together and weigh one pound of sugar to 
one pound of fruit. Boil two or three minutes, and put 
into cups or jars. 

687 Eipe Peach Marmalade. 

One-half pound of sugar, one pound of peaches, cut up; 
put the sugar over; cook slowly two hours; put in cups or 
bowls. 

688 Mrs. L.'s Receipt for Preserving Peaches. 

One peck of rich yellow peaches, five pounds of crushed 
sugar, one quart of water. Boil the syrup until clear, and, 
in the meantime, fill cans or jars with peaches, packed as 
full as possible, whole or in halves, as you please. Pour 
the syrup boiling hot over them; then place the jars thus 
filled in pans of warm water on the stove and let them be 
heated to the boiling point; then seal. N. B. — There is 
no danger of breaking the cans if a cloth is folded and 
laid on the bottom of the boiler. 



PICKLING BBINE 243 



PICKLING BRINE. 



689 To Cure Meat. 

For those who raise and cure their own meat, the fol- 
lowing will be an excellent recipe: To one gallon of 
water take one and one-half pounds of salt, one-half pound 
of sugar, one-half ounce of saltpetre, one-half ounce of pot- 
ash. In this ratio, the pickle to be increased to any 
quantity desired. Let these be boiled together until all 
the dirt from the sugar rises to the top and is skimmed off. 
Then throw it into a tub to cool, and when cold, pour it 
over your beef or pork, to remain the usual time, say 
four or five weeks. The meat must be well covered with 
pickle, and should not be put down for at least two days 
after killing, during which time it should be slightly 
sprinkled with powdered saltpetre, which removes all the 
surface blood, etc., leaving the meat fresh and clean. 

Some omit boiling the pickle, and find it to answer well, 
though the operation of boiling purifies the pickle by 
throwing off the dirt always to be found in salt and sugar. 
If this recipe is properly tried it will never be abandoned. 
There is none that surpasses it, if so good. 

690 Spiced Beef— Mrs. L. A. 

Take a piece of beef from the fore quarter, weighing ten 
pounds. Those who like fat should select a fatty piece; 
those who prefer lean may take the shoulder clod, or upper 
part of the fore leg. Take one pint of salt, one teacup of 
molasses or brown sugar, one tablespoon of ground cloves, 



244 PICKLING BRINE. 

allspice and pepper, and two tablespoons of pulverized 
saltpetre. Place the beef in a deep pan; rub with this 
mixture. Turn and rub each side twice a day for a week. 
Then wash off the spices; put in a pot of boiling water, 
and, as often as it boils hard, turn in a teacupf ul of cold 
water. It must simmer for five hours, on the back part of 
the stove. Press under a heavy weight till it is cold, and 
you will never desire to try corned beef of the butcher 
again. Your pickle will do for another ten pounds of beef, 
first rubbing into it a handful of salt. It can be renewed 
and a piece kept in preparation every day. This is good 
to pickle tongues also. 

691 Receipt for Curing Beef and Tongue. 

Six gallons of water, nine pounds of salt, three pounds 
of brown sugar, one quart of molasses, three ounces of 
saltpetre; boil all together and skim; when cold pour on 
the beef. This is quantity sufficient for one hundred 
pounds. Keep closely covered and under the bi'ine. 

692 Receipt for Curing Hams. 

To eight haras of common size, take eight pounds of 
brown sugar, one and a half pounds of saltpetre, five 
pounds of fine salt. Rub the hams with the mixture, and 
let them remain a week with the skins downward. Then 
make brine of common salt and water, strong enough to 
bear up an egg; add two or three quarts of lye made from 
hickory ashes, refined by boiling and skimming. Cover 
the hams with this liquid, keeping them down with a 
weight. Let them remain in it from four to six weeks, 
according to their size, then take them out and let them 
drain there for a day before sending them to the smoke 
house. 



WASHING AND CLEANING. 245 



WASHING AND CLEANING. 



693 The Use of Borax. 

The washerwomen of Holland and Belgium, so proverbi- 
ally clean, and who get their linen so beautifully white, 
use fine borax for washing powder, instead of soda, in the 
proportion of a large handful of borax powder to ten gal- 
lons of water. They save soap nearly one-half. All the 
large washing establishments adopt the same mode. For 
laces, cambrics, etc., an extra quantity of the powder is 
used; and for crinolines (requiring to be made stiff) a 
stronger solution is necessary. Borax, being a neutral salt, 
does not in the slightest degree injure the texture of linen. 
Its effect is to soften the hardest water, and therefore it 
should be kept on the toilet table. As a way of cleaning 
the hair, nothing is better than a weak solution of borax in 
water; it leaves the scalp in a most cleanly condition, and 
the hair is just sufficiently stiffened to retain its place. 
This stiffness, however, can be readily removed, if object- 
ionable, by washing with water. 

69A To Wash Flannel Without Shrinking It. 

Have plenty of hot soft water, make a suds with good 
soap, rub the clothes clean and rinse out all the soap. Do 
not let the clothes cool from the time they are wet till they 
are ready to put on the line. Put them into the next suds 
or the rinsing water as fast as wrung out, and the final 
rinsing be done with water having two tablespoonfuls of 
amonia to the gallon, and let them cool in the basket before 



246 WASHING AND CLEANING. 

you hang them up. Wash them in the morning, on a 
sunshiny day if possible, so they will have a good chance 
to dry. 

695 To Wash Colored Flannels. 

Make a suds of cold water and ordinary bar soap; wash 
the garment and rinse in cold water. Press while it is still 
damp. In this way children's fancy sacques and bright 
dresses may be kept looking like new, neither shrinkino' 
nor changing color. Don't be afraid to try it. 

A gallon of strong lye put in a barrel of hard water will 
make it as soft as rain water. 

6% To Remove Grass Stains. 

Pour boiling hot water on the stains before washing the 
garments. 

697 Nice Glossy Starch. 

To three cups water take three rounded teaspoonfuls of 
starch, a pinch of salt and one teaspoonful of powdered 
borax. Dissolve your borax in part of the water, then add 
starch and salt, dip your collars, cuffs and bosoms into the 
starch. Your irons must be good; rub them with beeswax, 
and I promise you a stiff, glossy surface, with never a failure. 

698 To Remove Iron Eust Stains. 

Salts of lemon is best, but if you do not have it moisten 
the spot with a solution of epsom salts in a few drops of 
hot water, and rub in well once or twice; then fill a tin 
vessel with boiling water and set it on the stain; rinse in 
cold water. A weak solution of oxalic acid will also 
remove iron rust and ink stains. 



WASHING AND CLEANING. 247 

699 To Remove Mildew. 

Rub common brown soap on the spot, and scrape white 
chalk in it. Keep wet and lay in the sun. 

700 To Remove Scorches. 

Scorches made by overheated flat-irons can be removed 
from linen by spreading over the scorched cloth a paste 
made of the juice pressed from two onions, one-half ounce 
of white soap, two ounces of fuller's earth, and half a pint 
of vinegar. Mix^ boil well and cool before using. 

Sometimes when a garment is yellowed by a too hot iron, 
exposure for a little while to the bright sunlight, if the 
scorch be not too deep, will cause it to disappear. 

701 To Prevent Blue Fabrics from Fading. 

Dissolve two teaspoon fuls of sugar of lead in one gallon 
of water, soak the stockings or cloth in this solution from 
half to one hour, according to material. Delicate fabrics 
need to soak only until saturated; rinse before washing and 
wash quickly. 

702 Bluing. 

One ounce of best Prussian blue, half ounce of oxalic 
acid, one quart of soft water. Heat enough of water to 
dissolve the acid, then stir in the blue, add cold water and 
bottle for use; keep in the cellar. 

703 To Wash Black Prints, Alpacas and Waterproofs. 

To a boilerful of strong soap-suds, put two handfuls of 
logwood chips, and let it boil half an hour; strain. Free 
the garment from grease spots and wet it thoroughly. Put 
it into the boiler and let it boil several minutes. Take it 
out and rinse in clear cold water until the water is color- 
less. Woolens should be ironed on the wrong side while 
quite damp. 



248 WASHING AND CLEANING. 

704 "Washing Compound— Mrs. L.'s. 

Three tablespoonfuls of ammonia, one tablespoonful of 
turpentine, five gallons of water, lukewarm; soak the 
clothes in this three hours. 

705 Washing Compound— Our Own. 

Cut up one bar of soap in two quarts of water; to this 
add one-quarter of a pound of commercial borax; in the 
evening stand a bowl containing this mixture over a kettle 
of hot water, and in the morning it will be of a wax-like 
consistency. Put a teacupful of this mixture into every 
pail of water in your wash-boiler, having previously rubbed 
some of it on the clothes and soaked them in lukewarm 
water for two hours, the dirt will shake right out. 

706 How Summer Suits should be Washed. 

Let the water be tepid, the soap not allowed to touch 
the fabric, which should be washed and rinsed quickly, 
turned upon the wrong side, and hung in the shade to dry, 
and starched (in thin boiled water starch, lukewarm), ironed 
upon the wrong side as soon as possible. Linen should be 
washed in water in which a quart bag of bran has been 
boiled. This last will be found to answer for starch as 
well, and is excellent for print dresses of all kinds. A 
handful of salt is very useful also to set the colors of light 
cambrics and dotted lawns; and a little beef's gall will not 
only set but heighten yellow and purple tints, and has a 
good effect upon green. 

707 Tc Clean Silk Dresses. 

Equal quantities of alcohol, molasses and soft soap; one 
pint of each will do two dresses; beat well together, and 
after spreading a breadth of silk on a clean kitchen table, 



WASHING AND CLEANING. 249 

scour it with an old bat clean clothes brush; have three 
tubs or pails of water, take up the breadth of silk by the 
top and dip it up and down in first one pail, then the second 
and then the third. When there is no color left in the 
water the rinsing is complete. Pin the breadths to the 
clothes line without wringing. When a little damp press 
out with a cold iron. Before cleaning, rub the grease 
spots with pure naphtha or gasoline. We have used this 
horrid-looking mixture with the best success on even light 
silks and silks with white stripes. 

708 To Restore Old Velvet. 

First brush the velvet thoroughly to free it from dust, 
then sponge the under side with alcohol; have ready a very 
hot flat iron inverted (this may be kept in place by putting 
the handle downward between two cold ones), and lay over 
it a wet cloth. While the steam rises pass the wrong side 
of the velvet over it to raise the pile. 

709 For Removing Grease from Woolen Goods. 

Nothing can excel gasoline or deoderized benzine in 
removing grease, and we sponge bad or old grease spots 
with gasoline before cleaning the ai'ticles with either of 
the four following receipts: 

710 To Clean Woolen Garments and Boys' Clothing. 

One ounce of borax, one ounce of spirits of camphor, one 
quart of boiling water. Lay a thick towel under the spot; 
then rub the soiled place with a woolen cloth dipped in the 
mixture. 



250 WASHING AND CliEANlNG. 

711 Japanese Cream. 

A most admirable detergent; try it and you will keep it 
always on hand Four ounces white castile soap, four 
ounces ammonia, two ounces ether, two ounces alcohol, 
one ounce glycerine. Cut the soap fine, dissolve in one 
quart of soft water over the fire. When dissolved, add 
four quarts more of water, then add the spirits. 

712 Paint Spots 

When neither turpentine nor benzine will remove paint 
spots from garments, try chloroform. It will absorb and 
remove paint which has been on for six months. 

713 Stains from Linen, Silk, or Woolen. 

Four tablespoon fuls of spirits of ammonia, the same 
quantity of alcohol, and a tablespoon of salt. Shake the 
whole well together in a bottle and apply with a sponge or 
tooth brush. Thi?* removes ink, paint, fruit or acid stains 
from silk, linen or woolen articles, but should be used cai*e- 
fully on colored garments. 

7 14 Hew to Wash Matting. 

Put a mixture of salt and lemon juice on the stains; 
leave this for some hours without washing off; then wash 
the wliole matting with salt and water. 

Ammonia in the water will whiten and brighten old 
white matting. 

715 How to Clean Carpets of Any Kind. 

Beat and shake thoroughly clear of dust; then tack 
smoothly to the floor, and with a scrubbing brush apply 
the following mixture: Half pound borax, one-quarter 
pound sal soda, half ounce alum, one and a half pounds of

rosin soap; cover with water and boil until dissolved; then 
pour into two buckets of water (rain water best) ; let stand 
until all thickens. When ready to use add half a pint of 
alcohol and one gill of ammonia. Scrub one place at a 
time thoroughly, the same as you would scrub a floor. 
Sponge off with clean, cold water, and leave doors and 
windows open till dry. This operation requires patience, 
muscle and elbow grease; but if directions are carefully 
followed, the " old rag " or any other kind of carpet will 
smile up at you bright and fresh as new. 

716 To Sweep a Carpet. 

Peel and wash four large potatoes; put them in a chop- 
ping bowl and chop into pieces the size of a pea; sprinkle 
them over the floor, brush them well over the carpet with 
your broom, and then sweep thoroughly. After using this 
you will forever discard salt, tea leaves, corn meal, etc. 

Another Method. — Put into a wash basin three quarts 
of water and one pint of pure naphtha. Sweep the room 
as above, and then dip your broom in this mixture and 
sweep again with it.

Perpetual vigilance is the price of freedom from the 
world of insects. 

717 Ledbugs. 

For these there is no sure cure, constant cleaning and 
watchfulness will keep them down and out of sight, but 
cease to clean and they will spring up and multiply in a 
month. Clean very thoroughly in March and April. 



252 TO BANISH VERMIN. 

Oil of cedar is an excellent and cleanly remedy. Salt 
and kerosene oil in cracks and under base boards is good. 

Carbolic acid is effectual. Sulphurous acid in paperer's 
paste will prevent them getting under newly papered 
walls. 

Gasoline or a strong solution of ammonia are both 
good remedies. 

A preparation of copperas, one pound to one gallon of 
boiling water. Sponging ,or painting the bedstead with 
this solution will drive them away for months. The only 
drawback is that it leaves a stain like iron rust, which 
never can be effaced. In Detroit they thrive on corrosive 
sublimate, 

718 Moths; A Bed Feppsr Smoke. 

This is the surest of all we ever tried: Hang up in a 
closet or clothes, press all woolen things, such as as dresses, 
clothes, overcoats, etc., and take a few ounces of cayenne 
pods (the imported article), or the dried red pepper of 
our gardens, and putting them upon some live coals in a 
tin pan, the bottom of which is covered with ashes, shut 
them close into your closet, and let it remain without open- 
ing for twenty-four hours; an attic infested with moths 
may require this process repeated three or four times. 
Carpets which are on the floor cannot, of course, be treated 
in this fashion, but by following the directions for sweep- 
ing a carpet with naptha and water, they can be banished. 
Brush furniture with the same preparation.. 

719 To Drive Away Red Ants. 

Grease a plate with lard and set it where the ants are 
troublesome; place a few sticks around the plate for the 
ants to climb up on; they will desert the sugar bowl for 



TO BANISH VERMIN. 253 

the lard; occasionally turn the plate over a fire where 
there is no smoke and the ants will drop into it; reset the 
plate, and in a few repetitions you will catck all the ants; 
they trouble nothing else while lard is accessible. 

Red lead and sugar sprinkled around your closet or 
wherever they come will drive them away. 

720 To Get^Eid of Water Bugs and Cockroaches. 

Powdered borax sprinkled over water pipes, closet 
shelves, etc., will drive them away. Should this fail, use 
Paris green or equal quantities of red lead flour and sugar 
on your water pipes, but to keep them away requires per- 
petual vigilances — find where they nest and with an insect 
powder puffer puff in the Paris green. 

721 To Drive Away Mice. 

Moisten chloride of lime, and stop their holes of ingress 
with the paste. If the holes are inaccessible, set the chloride 
around on small plates. Mice do not like it-

723 To Get Rid of Black Ants. 

Get five cents worth of tartar emetic, mix in an old sau- 
cer with sugar and water, and set in your pantry or cup- 
board, where the ants trouble you. In twenty-four hours 
every ant will have left the premises. With me the same 
dish of tartar emetic answered as well the second year as 
the first; as the water dries out add more. 



254 DAIRY AND COWS. 



DAIRY AND COWS. 



724 To Purify Dairy Utensils. 

Stand on end, in a convenient place for use, an open- 
ended vessel of suitable dimensions for the size of the 
dairy, say from half a barrel to a hogshead. In this slake 
some good quicklime, enough to make a thin whitewash, 
then fill full of water, and cover to keep out dust and dirt. 
The lime will settle, leaving a saturated solution of lime 
over it, as clear as spring water. After using the milk- 
pans, etc., wash them as other utensils are washed and 
rinsed, then dip them in the adjoining cask of lime water, 
giving them a quick turn, so that every part becomes 
immersed therein; set them to drain and dry, and the puri- 
fication is complete, without any scalding process, from 
the new pan to the worn-out one. The lime in the clear 
water instantly ueuti'alizes the acidity of the milk yet 
remaining in the cracks or seams, etc., of the milk vessels, 
to destroy which the process of scalding has been per- 
formed. In the case of a very small dairy, or of one cow. 
the clear water may, if preferred, be dipped out for the 
time being and poured gently back again, the lime purify- 
ing the water and keeping it good all summer. 

725 To Make Cows Give Milk. 

A writer who says his cow gives all the milk that is 
wanted in a family of eight persons, and from which was 
made two hundred and sixty pounds of butter last year, 
gives the following as his treatment. He says: " If you 



GENEKAL INFORMATION, 255 

desire to get a large yield of rich milk, give your cow, 
three times a day, water slightly warmed, slightly salted, 
in which bran has been stirred at the rate of one quart to 
two gallons of water. You will find, if you have not tried 
this daily practice, that your cow will give twenty-five per 
cent more, immediately under the effect of it, and she will 
become so attached to the diet as to refuse to drink clear 
water, unless very thirsty; but this mess she will drink 
almost any time, and 'ask for more.' The amount of this 
drink necessary is an ordinary water pailful each time, 
noon and night. Four hundred pounds of butter are often 
obtained from good stock, and instances are mentioned 
where the yield is often at a higher figure." 



GENERAL INFORMATION. 



73 Useful Notes. 

To remove paint splashed upon the window panes use a 
hot solution of soda and rub with soft flannel. 

Raw potato will take rust off steel. 

A hot shovel held over varnished furniture will take out 
white spots. So will rubbing with a soft cloth wet in 
spirits of camphor, followed by another dipped in a mix- 
ture of sweet oil and turpentine to restore the polish. 

A cement made of gum shellac one part, and aqua 
ammonia ten parts, will cement rubber. 

A good cement for marble may be made by melting and 
stiri'ing together one part of white wax and eight parts of 
resin, and then adding four parts of plaster of Paris. It 
should be used while hot. 



256 THE COMPLEXION. 

The reason lamp chimnys so often crack is because they 
are not properly annealed. If, before using, the chimney 
is placed in a kettle of cold water, and the water gradually 
brought to the boiling point, and the chimney removed 
after the water has cooled again, it will be far less likely 
crack. Other articles of glass may be tempered in the 
same way. 



THE COMPLEXION, 



It has come to be the custom to put in all receipt books 
some absurdity as " a face wash." We tested several of 
these and found them flat failures in every particular. 
We therefor offer a few hints on the care of the skin. 
Wash the face thoroughly in warm or very hot water, 
using a French soap called Sue du Laitu or a paste called 
Pate d'Amande au Miel, both of these are made by the 
Parisian perfumers, Violet and Coudray, and are simply 
designed to give a fine grain and good color to the skin. 
We also give a receipt for a glycernine lotion that we 
know to be very nice indeed. 

A shrewd and fresh looking woman of fifty with no 
wrinkles in her face and a skin as soft and fine as a girl's, 
gives us this advice: "Use tepid water (or pretty warm 
water if you have an oily skin), the choicest quality of 
well made soap — the softest towels — then icash your face 
toith your hands. No sponge, no wash clothes, but youb 
HANDS, working your fingers into the wrinkles and creases 
of the face and especially the nose; rinse the face well, 



THE COMPLEXION. 257 

dry it carefully and rub it all over with a flesh-brush, that 
is what I do." I know one wise woman who rinses her 
face with water in which she has stirred a teaspoonful of 
the finest oat-meal, dries it on a soft towel and rubs it well 
with a very fine chamois skin. 

727 Tor Removing Snn Burn and Tan. 

A famous preparation for removing sun burn and tan is 
very simple yet excellent, and is composed of equal parts 
of lemon juice and white of egg beaten together in an 
earthen pot, set over a slow fire, and stirred with a wooden 
spoon until it acquires the consistency of soft pomatum. 
If the face is well washed with rice water before it is 
applied, it will remove freckles and give brilliancy to the 
complexion. Cold water and coarse towels will make the 
skin, in time, harsh and wrinkled; water for the face and 
hands must be tepid and the towels soft and fine. 

728 Another Necessary to the Toilette. 

A teaspoonful of oat-raeal at a time saturated with water 
until it assumes the color of milk is deemed by many, indis- 
pensable. It washes the skin inexpressibly fine, soft, and 
smooth, both of face and hands. The soaked oat-raeal is 
so glutinous that it is far superior to soap where the best 
cannot be had. 

729 Care of the Hair. 

The Spanish and Cuban women are far-famed for the 
luxuriant growth and beauty of their hair, and the secret 
of its culture was told me by a Cuban friend. Every 
month the head is thoroughly shampooed with the yolk of 
a well-beaten egg; the cleansing properties are wonderful. 
Then this rather unpleasant stickiness is removed by the 
17

hair and head being carefully washed in a basin of tepid 
water to which is added half a teaspoonful of ammonia 
and a pinch of powdered borax 

730 Glycerine Lotion for Pace and Hands. 

Three ounces of glycerine, ten drachms of mucilage of 
quince, five grains of pulverized cochineal, one and a- half 
ounces of hot water, two and one-half ounces of deodorized 
alcohol, eight drops of oil of rose, half a drachm of pulver- 
ized gum arabic, eight ounces of water. 

Rub the powdei'ed cochineal^ first, with the hot water 
gradually added, and then add the alcohol; then triturate 
the oil of rose well with the powdered gum arabic, and 
gradually add the water, as in| making emulsion. With 
this mix well the solution first formed, and filter, and to 
the filtered liquid add the glycerine and mucilage of quince 
seeds, and shake well. 

The mucilage of quince seeds should always be freshly 
made. If the alcohol is sweet and free from foreign odor, 
and the glycerine perfectly inodorous, a less quantity of 
oil of roses may suffice. 

If care is taken in its manufacture this will form a 
beautiful and elegant preparation, with a rich, rosy frag- 
rance. 

When applied to the skinfit'^imparis an agreeably soft, 
smooth and velvety feel. It is an excellent application for 
the face after shaving. 

I have tried many similiar combinations, but have never 
found an article that has been so generally admired'and so 
universally popular as this. 



SPECIFICS AND RKMEDIES. 259 

731 Red Lip Salve. 

Oil of sweet almonds, two ounces; pure olive oil, six 
ounces; spermaceti, one and one-half ounces; white wax, 
one ounce. Color with carmine and perfume with oil of 
roses. 

232 Carrot Salve and Ointment for Chapped Hands. 

One-half pound mutton tallow, fresh, one-half pound leaf 
lard (unsalted), one-half pound scraped and grated orange 
carrots. Let the lard and tallow render out, strain the 
grease on the carrots and let boil or rather heat in a 
basin of boiling water. Add a lump of camphor as large 
as an English walnut; the same of borax and half as much 
carbonate of ammonia, let them boil an hour; strain 
through a fine cloth and when partly cooled whip soft 
with an egg beater, put into pots, cover with paper and 
wet with alcohol; good for abrasions and burns.

SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES. 



733 A Remedy for the Diphtheria. 

Dr. Field, of Victoria, used powdered sulphur and a 
quill. He put a teaspoonful of flour of brimstone into a 
wine-glass of water and stirred it with his finger instead of 
a spoon, as the sulphur does not readily amalgamate with 
water. When the sulphur was well mixed he gave it as 
a gargle. Brimstone kills every species of fungus in man, 
beast and plant in a very few minutes. Instead of spitting 
• ut gargle, he recommended the swallowing of it. In 



260 SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES, 

extreme cases, when the fungus was too nearly closing the 
throat to allow the gargle, he blew the sulphur through a 
quill into the throat, and after the fungus had shrunk to 
allow of it, then the gargling. 

If the patient cannot gargle, take a live coal, put it on a 
shovel and sprinkle a spoonful or two of flour of brimstone 
at a time upon it; let the sufferer inhale it, holding the 
head over it, and the fungus will die. If plentifully used, 
the whole room may be filled almost to suffocation, and 
the patient can walk about in it, inhaling the fumes, with 
doors and windows closed. 

734 Sulpfenr in Scarlet Fever. 

Thoroughly annoint the patient twice daily with sulphur 
ointment; give five to ten grains of sulphur in a little 
jam three times a day. Sufficient sulphur was burned twice 
daily (on coals on a shovel) to fill the room with the 
fumes, and of course was thoroughly inhaled by the 
patient. Under this mode of treatment each case improved 
immediately, and none were over eight days in making a 
complete recovery, and I firmly believe in each it was 
prevented from spreading by the treatment adopted. One 
case was in a large school. Having had a large exDeri- 
ence in scarlet fever last year and this, I feel some con- 
fidence in my own judgment, and I am of the opinion that 
the very mildest cases I ever saw do not do halfso well as 
bad cases do by the sulphur treatment, and as far as I can 
judge, sulphur is as near a specific for scarlet fever as pos- 
sible. — Dr. Henry Pigeon., in London Lancet. 

735 To Cure Croup. 

Croup can often be cured by alum and sugar. Take a 
knife or grater, and shave off, in small particles, about a 



SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES. 261 

teaspoouful of alum; then mix with about twice its 
quantity of sugar to make it palatable, and administer it 
as quickly as possible. Almost instantaneous relief will 
follow. 

736 A Eemedy for Croup. 

Let a healthy person fill his lungs with pure air; then 
slowly breathe upon the patient's throat and chest, com- 
mencing at the point of the chin and moving slowly down 
to the bottom of the windpipe. Repeat for a few minutes 
and it will give relief in cases where all other means fail. 

My boy was always subject to croup; came near dying 
with the rattling, noisy kind at about eleven months old, 
I saved him with fomentations of warm water, and ever 
after prevented a serious attack by watchfulness and water. 
But when three years old, I let him play in the brook one 
warm rainy day, and he took a severe cold and had the 
still kind of croup, the first and last time he ever had it. 
In spite of all I could do, he grew constantly worse until 
he could only gasp and breathe with his head thrown back. 
We thought his last moments had come, when I thought 
and applied Bronson's remedy for a minute. When I 
stopped he looked up and said, "Do eo again, mother, do," 
though he could not speak when I began. You may be 
assured I did so again, and I believe it saved his life. 

737 Mothers' Milk. 

The bruised leaves of the castor oil plant will cause the 
mother's milk to return by laying it upon the breast. It 
is worth trying. 

738 To Stop th9 Bleeding of Wounds. 

A piece of an enameled card, used as a court plaster, 
will almost always stanch bleeding. 



262 SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES. 

739 To Cure Corns. 

Apply young peach leaves, bruised and moistened, on 
the corns every night until relieved. This remedy can 
only be used from May till November, but it is so excellent 
that we advise our readers to cure their corns during 
these months. Mr. W. 

740 Soda Mint. 

Bicarb, soda (Eng. ), one drachm; pure water, thre^ 
ounces; spearmint water, four ounces; glycerine, one 
ounce; ar. spts. ammonia, thirty-two drops. Mix and 
filter. Dose from twenty drops to a tablespoonful, accord- 
ing to age. 

741 Wash for Inflamed Eyes. 

Sulph. zinc, two grains; wine of opium, ten drops; dis- 
tilled water, one ounce; mix. Drop two or three drops in 
the outer corner of the eye several times a day. 

742 For Chilblains (Exoellent.) 

Burgundy pitch, one ounce; sperm oil, one ounce; bees- 
wax, two ounces; spirits of turpentine, one-half ounce. 
Simmer first three ingredients well together, and when 
nearly cool add the turpentine. Spread on a cloth and 
lay as a plaster on the chilblains, after the feet have been 
well washed and soaked. Draw a fresh stocking over the 
plaster and keep on for three days and nights; if not cured 
repeat the whole process. Mary Goodrich. 

743 An Ugly but Efiicacions Remedy for Chilblains. 

Take a saucer of kerosene oil and add a handful of salt, 
mix thoroughly and apply to chilblains; then heat the chil- 
blains at a very hot fire; when the heat becomes unbear- 
able " grit" your teeth and bear a little longer; as soon as 



SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES. 203 

the pain subsides a little repeat the operation. Do this 
three or four times. I tried it six years ago on the worst 
assortment of chilblains I ever saw. 

N. B. This has been of great service to many, but we 
have to record its failure in at least one instance. 

744 Flaxseed Syrup. 

This excellent remedy for a cough is made thus: boil 
one ounce of flaxseed in a quart of water for half an hour; 
strain and add to the liquid the juice of two lemons, and 
half a pound of rock candy. If the cough is accompan- 
ied with weakness and loss of appetite, add half an ounce 
of powdered gum arabic. Set this to simmer for half an 
hour, stirring occasionally. Take a wineglass of it when 
the cough is troublesome. 

745 Lemon for Colds. 

Slice the lemon or lemons, add a little water and consid- 
erable sugar, and set into the oven until well simmered 
together. 

746 Chronic Diarrhcea. 

A teaspoonful of wheat flour mixed into a cup of sweet 
milk, with a little nutmeg grated into it. Take it cold and 
raw. Beat it well, so that it foams. To be taken three or 
four times a day. 

747 For Neuralgia and Headache. 

Alcohol, one ounce; laudanum, one-eighth ounce, chloro- 
form, five-eights ounce; gum camphor, one-half ounce; oil 
cloves, one-half drachm; oil lavendar, one drachm; sulphu- 
ric ethei", three-quarters drachm; rub the part affected and 
inhaie the liniment. It is also a good thing for sick head- 
ache, by rubbing the forehead with the liniment, and 
inhaling the same, the pain is relieved. 



264 SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES. 

748 Senna Figs— For Constipation. 

Take four ounces of senna and infuse it two hours in one 
pint of boiling water. Strain this liquor over one pound 
of fresh figs or prunes, with a handful of loaf sugar; let 
the prunes stew till well cooked, soft and pulpy; then put 
them into a jar for use. Eat one or two at night when 
retiring or oftener through the day if the bowels are very 
sluggish. 

749 To Take Senna. 

Take a pinch of senna leaves, pour a wineglass of cold 
water upon it and let it stand all day. Drink this at night 
on retiring. Increase the senna and water if necessary. 

750 For Burns. 

Procure from a tallow chandler a few ounces of palm 
oil, which is a brownish yellow substance the consistency 
of lard; spread it on a cloth and apply to the burn. Should 
the face or eyes have been burned, paint the oil on with a 
camel's hair brush every hour. The effect is almost mir- 
aculous. By the use of it a terrific gunpowder burn was 
cured in six days without the sign of a scar. 

751 Relief for Scalds Where the Skin is not Broken. 

Apply a layer of common salt and saturate it with lauda- 
num; hold it in position a few hours with a simple wrap- 
ping. The smarting will disappear almost immediately. 
This acted like magic on a burn produced by scalding tea. 

752 Toothache. 

According to the London Lancet, can be cured by the 
following preparation of carbolic acid: To one drachm of 
coUodium add two drachms of Calvert's carbolic acid. A 



SPECIFICS AND REMEDIKS. 265 

gelatinous mass is precipitated, a small portion of which, 
inserted in the cavity of an aching tooth, invariably gives 
immediate relief, 

753 Antidote for Poison. 

A poison of any conceivable description and degree of 
potency, which has been swallowed intentionally or by 
accident, may be rendered almost instantaneously harmless 
by swallowing two gills of sweet oil. An individual with 
a very sti'ong constitution should take twice the quantity. 
The oil will neutralize every form of vegetable or mineral 
poison with which physicians are acquainted. Follow with 
emetics of a teaspoonful of mustard, and one of salt; repeat 
if necessary. 

754 For an Overdose of Chloroform. 

A curious means of reviving patients who are in danger 
of death from chloroform is brought out by the recent fatal 
accident in Boston. It reverses the sentence " to be hung 
by the neck until you are dead," and declares that a man 
must be hung by the heels until he isn't dead — to provide 
the needed supply of blood for the head. 

755 For Piles or Sore Nipples. 

Take the leaves of sweet clover (the tall garden flower) 
when they are in milk; pick them and put them into an 
iron vessel with thick sweet cream; let all simmer or boil 
gently, without burning, until you can pour off a clear 
green oil; this, when it cools, hardens into a salve, which 
can be inserted into the rectum. Mrs. Merrick. 

Stramonium prepared in the same way is also recom- 
mended. 



266 SPECIFICS AND REMEDIES. 

The sweet clover makes a delightful salve by boiling it 
in the very best sweet oil, and adding to each cupful of the 
strained oil half an ounce of beeswax. 

756 Nipple Salve (''Sure Cure"). 

One and-a-half tablespoonfuls of cream from milk that 
has stood two hours, one tablespoonful of the purest olive 
oil, piece of white wax the size of a fifty cent piece; put 
on the stove in a saucer and stir until it boils, then cool a 
few moments, and put in five cents worth of tannin, and a 
little camphor gum the size of a small pea. Stir all the 
time until cold. To be put on fine tissue paper and applied 
to the nipple. N. B. — There is no " sure cure " for any 
thing, but this salve is most helpful, and has been used 
with praise by hundreds. 

757 To Remove Milk Crust from an Infant's Head. 

Moisten well with raw linseed oil. Put on an oil skin 
cap, fitting close to the head to exclude the air. 

758 Remedy for Piles— Prom Madame R. 

Take inwardly, for one or more nights, until the bowels 
act, two teaspoonfuls of sulphur in a little milk, and apply 
as an ointment one ounce of pulverized nut gall in a table- 
spoonful of lard.

759 To Hasten Cooking. 

All kinds of poultry and meat can be cooked quicker by 
adding to the water in which they are boiled, a little vine- 
gar or a little piece of lemon. By the use of an aoid, there 
will be considerable saving of fuel as well as shortening of 
time. Its action is beneficial on old tough meats, render- 
ing them quite tender and easy to be digested. 

760 To Seep Meat Fresh. 

Here is a Japanese recipe for keeping meat fresh in hot 
weather: "Place it in a clean porcelain bowl and pour 
very hot water over it, so as to cover it. Then pour oil on 
the water. The air is thus quite excluded, and the meat is 
preserved." This is a very nice way of keeping a calf's 
liver fresh over night. 

761 To Preserve Eggs. 

Roll each egg in thin paper; put the small end down 
into a peach basket or crate, that will admit of ventilation; 
set in a cool place where they will not freeze, and they 
will keep all winter. This is a truly good receipt. To 
rub the egg all over with melted butter or lard is also 
excellent.

and put to dry in a warm place. 

Or, pour four ounces of lemon juice upon one pound of 
loaf sugar with the same amount of rose-water as of lemon 
juice; boil to a thick syrup, add grated ^lemon peel and 
proceed as in the first recipe. 

771 Raspberry Drops 

Are made by using the juice of either fresh berries, or 
the preserve syrup, in the place of lemon juice. 

772 Cazenovia Caramels— Very Nice. 

One half pound gi-ated chocolate, not sweet, one pint of 
milk or cream, three pounds brown sugar, eight ounces of 
butter. Mix all together; put over a hot fire and stir con- 
stantly until it comes to a boil. Boil hard twenty minutes. 
Try in cold water, and when hard enough pour out an 
inch thick. When nearly cold mark off in squares. 



COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 



Beef tea has become an essential in cases of typhoid 
fever, etc., but as the symptoms and digestion of patients 
vary, we give three methods: No. 1 takes long in prep- 
aration, and may prove a little heavy for some stomachs. 
No. 2 is open to the same objection. No. 3 is an excellent 
stand-by. Beef juice can be used when nothing else will 
be retained upon the stomach. 



COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 271 

773 Beef Tea— Dr. Chambers. No. 1. 

Take half a pound of fresh beef for every pint of beef 
tea required, free from all fat, sinew, veins and bone. Cut 
it into pieces less than half an inch square and soak for 
twelve hours in half a pint of cold water. Let it then be 
taken out and simmer for two hours in one pint of water; 
the quantity lost from evaporation being replaced from 
time to time; the boiling liquor is then to be placed on 
the cold liquor in which the meat was soaked; the solid 
meat is to be dried, pounded in a mortar, freed from all 
stringy parts and mixed with the rest. Beef tea should 
not be kept hot but warmed when required. 

774 Beef Tea, No. 2, or Essence of Beef. 

Is quite different from beef tea, and is made by packing 
the chopped beef in a Hero or Mason preserve jar or a 
bottle, and lightly covering or corking the vessel; place it 
in a pot of cold water and let it come to a boil and con- 
tinue to cook till the meat which was placed without water 
in the jar is so dissolved as to produce a teacup or more of 
liquid; this is much stronger than beef tea, but not nearly 
as digestible. 

775 Beef Tea. No. 3. 

Take a pound of fine steak free from skin, fat and sinew. 
Lay it on a gridiron over hot coals and grill white on each 
side; then put it in your chopping bowl and chop fine; 
pour over enough cold water to just cover the meat and let 
stand on the back part of the stove for two hours, then 
bring to a scald and strain. N. B. — Should the tea be 
required in great haste, a little can be brought at once to 
a scald. 



-272 COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 

776 Chicken and Mutton Tea. 

Chicken prepai'ed in same way is good, and mutton 
thus prepared is especially good for teething children 
when the bowels are affected. As the patient gets better, 
rice can be added to the soup, and thyme or parsley, and 
pepper. This is much less trouble and far nicer than the- 
old way of making beef tea in a bottle and cooking for 
hours. 

777 Beef Juice. 

Prepare the beef as in receipt No. 444, and when cut in 
squares squeeze it dry in a glass lemon squeezer, salt. Give 
oue teaspoonful at a time. 

778 Gruel. 

The lightest possible gruel is made by taking two 
heaping tablespoonf uls of yellow corn meal, pour upon it a 
teacup of cold water and stir thoroughly. While settling- 
pour this water into a teacupf ul of water at a keen boil and 
«cald for five minutes. Add plenty of salt. Do not put let 
in the coai-se yellow part of the meal that settles at the 
bottom of the cold water. 

779 Milk Porridge. 

One pint of milk, reserving two tablespoonfuls, place on 
the stove and let come to a boil; stir in one heaping tea- 
spoonful of flour that has been smoothly mixed with the 
two tablespoons of milk. Let boil three minutes. Salt 
well. Excellent for diarrhoea. 

780 Cracker Gruel. 

Six tablespoonfuls fine cracker crumbs, one quart of 
milk, one-half teaspoonful of salt; put crumbs and milk 
into double boiler: let it come to a boil, add the salt and 
cook two minutes longer. 



COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 2V3 

781 Oat-Meal Gruel. 

Into one quart of boiling water sprinkle two table- 
spoonfuls of coarse oat-meal; let boil forty minutes; salt 
and strain. Where the patient can use milk and cream, it 
can be put into the gruel subtracting an equal quantity of 
water. 

782 Indian Meal Gruel. 

One quart of boiling water; stir into this one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, two tablespoonfuls of Indian meal. Mix the 
flour with a little water, add the meal and boil from thirty 
to sixty minutes; season with plenty of salt. 

783 Arrowroot Gruel. 

One pint of milk, one teaspoonful arrowroot, salt to 
taste; let milk come to a boil, resert^ing a little cold milk 
with which to mix the arrowroot, stir into the boiling milk 
and cook ten minutes. If milk is too heavv use water. 



784 Ice Cream for the Sick. 

One cup of milk, one teaspoonful of arrowroot, one pint 
of cream, not too rich ( scalded ). A scant half cupful of 
sugar; scald the milk and aiTOwroot together ten minutes 
and freeze. Nine parts of ice to one part of salt. 

785 Scrambled Eggs (for one). 

One egg, two tablespoonfuls of milk, a bit of butter as 
large as a hickory nut, pepper and salt; pour into a hot 
buttered spider and stir just a minute. Butter a slice of 
hot toast and pour the egg over it.

274 COOKERY FOR THE SICK, 

786 Cream Toast (for one). 

Toast and butter a round of stale bread, pour over it 
three tablespoonfuls of thick cream and half a saltspoonful 
of salt, into which has been stirred three tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water. Serve quickly. 

787 The Uses of the Lemon. 

The London I^ancet remarks, few people know the value 
of lemon juice. A piece of lemon bound upon a corn will 
cure it in a few days; it should be renewed night and 
morning. A free use of lemon juice and sugar will always 
relieve a cough. Most people feel poorly in the spring, 
but if they would eat a lemon before breakfast every day 
for a week — with or without sugar, as they like it — they 
would find it better than any medicine. Lemon juice used 
according to this recipe will sometimes cure consumption: 
Put a dozen lemons int* cold watei-, and slowly bring to a 
boil; boil slowly until the lemons are soft, then squeeze 
until all the juice is extracted, add sugar to your taste and 
drink. In this way use one dozen lemons a day. After 
using six dozen the patient will begin to gain flesh and 
enjoy food. 

788 Milk as a Diet, Its Effeot. 

Milk, diluted with one-third lime-water, it is said, will 
not cause any one biliousness, and, if taken regularly, will 
so strengthen the stomach as to banish these disorders. It 
may be taken with acid of some kind when it does not 
e£8ily digest. The idea that milk must not be eaten with 
pickles is not an intelligent one, as milk curdles in the 
stomach nearly as soon as it is swallowed. When milk is 
constipating, as it is frequently found to be by persons 
who drink freely of it in the country in the summer time, 



COOKERY FOK THE SICK. 2Y5 

a little salt sprinkled in each glassful will prevent the dif- 
ficulty. As milk is so essential to the health of our bodies 
it is well to consider when to take it, and how. It is a 
mistake to drink milk between meals, or with food at the 
table. In the former case it will destroy the appetite; and 
in the latter it is never proper to drink anything. After 
finishing each meal a goblet of pure milk should be drunk; 
and if any one wishes to grow fleshy, a pint taken before 
retiring at night will soon cover the scrawniest bones. In 
cases of fever and summer complaint, milk is given with 
excellent results. The idea that milk is " feverish " has 
long since been exploded, and it is now the physician's 
great reliance in bringing through typhoid patients, or 
those in too low a state to be nourished by solid food. 

789 To Make Lime-Water. 

The way to make lime-water is simply to procure a few 
lumps of unslackedlime,putthelimein'astonejar,add water 
until the lime is slacked and about the consistency of thin 
cream; the lime settles, leaving the pure and clear lime 
water at the top. Three or four tablespoonfuls of it may 
be added to a goblet of milk. 

790 How to Make a Mustard Poultice. 

A mustard poultice should never make a blister at all. 
If a blister is wanted, there are other plasters far better 
than mustard for the purpose. When you make a mustard 
plaster, then, use no water whatever, but mix the mustard 
with the white of an egg, and the result will be a plaster 
that will " draw " perfectly, but will not produce a blister, 
even upon the skin of an infant, no matter how long it is 
allowed to remain upon the part. 



276 INDELIBLE INK, PASTE, CEMENT, ETC. 

791 Cure for a Pelon. 

Take the skin of an egg and bind it upon the finger 
where the pain begins. It will have to be removed from 
time to time as the contraction is so great that it cannot be 
borne long. 

792 Cure for a Run-Round. 

If taken in time a run-round can be greatly benefited by 
holding it in water as hot as can be endured. Repeat this 
operation several times. 



INDELIBLE INK, PASTE, CEMENT, Etc. 

793 To Mend China. 

Take a very thick solution of gum arable in water, and 
stir into it plaster of Paris until the mixtui-e becomes of 
the proper consistency. Apply it with a brush to the 
fractured edges of the china, and stick them together. In 
three days the article cannot be broken in the same place. 
The whiteness of the cement renders it doubly valuable. 

794 A Cheap Fumigator. 

The following will be found to be a cheap and pleasant 
fumigator for sick rooms, diffusing a healthful, agreeable, 
and highly penetrating disinfectant odor in close apart- 
ments, or wherever the air is deteriorated: 

Pour common vinegar on powdered chalk until efferves- 
cence ceases, leave the whole to settle, and pour off the 
liquid. Dry the sediment, and place it in a shallow earthen 
or glass dish, and pour upon it sulphuric acid until white 
fumes commence rising. This vapor very quickly spreads, 
is very agreeable, pungent, and acts as a powerful purifier 
of vitiated air. 



INDELIBLE INK, PASTE, CEMENT, ETC. 2V7 

795 To Purify a Sink. 

In hot weather it is ahiiost impossible to pi'event the 
sinks becoming foul, unless some chemical preparation is 
used. One pound of copperas dissolved in four gallons of 
water, poured over a sink three or four times, will com- 
pletely destroy the offensive odor. As a disinfecting agent, 
to scatter around premises affected with any unpleasant 
odor, nothing is better than a niixiure of four parts dry 
ground plaster of Paris to one part of fine charcoal, by 
weight. All sorts of glass vessels and other utensils may 
be effectually purified from offensive smells by rinsing them 
with charcoal powder, after the grosser impurities liave 
been scoured off with sand and soap. 

796 Indelible Ink. 

Use a quill pen with this ink, which is first-rate. Half 
a stick of lunar caustic or nitrate of silver dissolved in a 
bottle, with one large spoonful of pure sti'ong vinegar. 
Hang the bottle in the sun, shaking two or three times a 
day. In two weeks it will be found to be better than any 
ink that can be bought for marking with a pen, but it is 
too thin to use with a stencil. It is inexpensive, too, and 
some of the finest and most artistic specimens of linen 
marking we ever have seen were done with this ink. It 
grows black, instead of fading with time. 

797 Paste That Will Keep Well. 

A perpetual paste can be made by dissolving one ounce 
of alum in a quart of warm water, in which a dozen cloves 
have been well boiled; when cold, add fiour enough to 
m.ake it the consistency of cream; then stir into it half a 
teaspoonful of powdered resin. Boil it to a proper con- 



278 INDELIBLE INK, PASTE, CEMENT, ETC. 

sistency, stirring all the time. Strain it hot through a thin 
muslin cloth. It will keep for twelve months, and when 
dry may be softened with water. 

798 Mucilage Which Always Keeps Pure. 

One pound of gum arable dissolved in one pint of boil- 
ing water; add a piece of borax the size of a walnut; bottle 
in a large-mouthed bottle; shake up three or four days 
after it is made. One tablespoonf ul of alcohol will prevent 
mold. 

799 To Repair Walls. 

White walls can be easily repaired without sending for 
the mason. Equal parts of plaster of Paris and white 
sand — such as is used in most families for scouring pur- 
poses — mixed with water to a paste, applied immediately 
and smoothed with a knife or flat piece of wood, will make 
the broken place as good as new. As the mixture hardens 
very quickly, it is best to prepare but a small quantity at 
a time. 

800 To Extinguish Kerosene Flames. 

One of the most ready means is to throw a cloth of some 
kind over the flames, and thus stifle them; but as the cloth 
is not always convenient to the kitchen, where such acci- 
dents are most likely to occur, some one recommends flour 
as a substitute, which, it is said, promptly extinguishes the 
flame. It rapidly absorbs the fluid, deadens the flames, 
and can be readily gathered up and thrown out of doors 
when the fire is extinguished. A friend of ours finding 
her kitchen on fire from an exjjloded lamp, extinguished 
the flames by throwing several spadesful of earth upon it. 



ODDS AND ENDS. 279 

801 For Indoor "Whitewashing. 

For every sixteen joounds of Paris white (it is sold at 
paint stores for three cents a pound), get one-half pound of 
transparent glue; cover the glue with cold water at night, 
and in the morning heat it, without scorching, till dissolved. 
Stir in the Paris white with hot water to give it a milky 
consistency. Then add and mix well the glue. Apply with 
a common lime whitewash brush. A single coating will 
do, except on very dingy walls. It is almost as brilliant as 
zinc white. 



ODDS AND ENDS. 



802 Burnt Almonds (for dessert). 

Blanch and dry half a pound of almonds, put a bit of 
butter the size of a nutmeg into a tin dripping-pan, set 
them in your oven and brown as you would coffee, only 
a very light brown. As you take them up, give them 
a light dash of salt; serve cold with figs or raisins. 

803 Ice Cream Cake. Very nice. ' 

One cup powdered sugar, one-half cup butter, whites of 

^two eggs, one-half cup of milk, one and-a-half even cups of 

flour, one teaspoonful baking powder. Frost with the 

yolks of two eggs. Flavor the cake with vanilla, the 

frosting with lemon. Mrs. Todd. 



280 OIJDS AND ENDS. 

804 Sweet-Breads Pried. 

As they spoil easily, put into cold salted water the 
moment they come from the market, soaking them one 
hour; then put into boiling salt-water, cook from half to 
one hour until thoroughly tender. Put aside until cold^ 
then remove the little pipes and pieces of skin carefully 
Cut into slices half an inch thick, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, dip in egg and bread crumbs and fry in boiling 
lard. Always test the lard before frying by putting in a 
small piece of bread, if it turns yelloAV instantly the lard is 
hot enough. 



805 Sweet-Breads Stewed. 

Prepare as above. Cut into small pieces. Make a sauce 
by heating an ounce of butter and one third of an onion 
chopped very fine; add a teaspoonful of flour, a little beef 
stock and milk, salt and pepper. When cooked put in the 
sweet-bi'eads. Serve for breakfast. 



806 Stewed Kidneys. 

Soak the kidneys (sheep or lamb kidneys the best) in 
cold, salt-water for an hour, having previouslj^ sliced them 
into thin pieces. Then put into cold water, and boil steadily 
until tender as liver, renewing the water frequently. Take 
them out when done; then take the water in which they 
have been cooking, add a little cream, butter, salt and pep- 
per, thicken with flour until the consistency of sauce, then 
put the kidneys back for a moment. Serve on slices of 
thin toast, adding to the sauce, just before serving, a 
teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce. 



OODS AND KNDS. 281 

807 Delmonico Croquettes. 

Chop the meat very fine. One onion fried in one ounce 
of butter, add one teaspoonful of flour, stir well; then add 
the meat and a little beef stock, salt and pepper; stir for 
two or three minutes then put into a dish until cold. When 
cold mix well together again. Divide into parts for cro- 
quettes, roll into desired shapes, dip in ogg and in bread- 
crumbs, and fry in boiling lard, having previously tested 
the lard. Serve plain, with fried parsley for a garniture, 
or with tomato sauce. F. E. 

808 Veal Pasty. 

One pound of veal, quarter of a pound of raw ham — 
lean and fat together — chop both together until quite fine, 
season with pepper, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon, a bit of 
butter. Make a good pufi" paste, spread a spoonful or two 
in each and fold over as in old-fashioned Hurn-overs. Wet 
the edge of the paste and press it together and bake in a 
slow oven for thirty minutes. This quantity will make five 
pasties. Mrs. S — gs. 

809 Vanilla Ice Cream. 

The foundation given in this rule is suitable for all kinds 
of ice cream. One generous pint of milk, one cupful of 
sugar, half a cupful of flour, scant/ two eggs, one quart of 
cream, one tablespoonful of vanilla extract, and when the 
cream is added another cupful of sugar. Let the milk 
come to a boil. Beat the first cupful of sugar, the flour 
and eggs together and stir into boiling milk. Cook twenty 
minutes, stirring often. Set away to cool, and when cool 
add sugar, seasoning and cream, and fi'eeze. 



282 LUNCHES. 

810 Coffee Ice Cream (Exceedingly Nice). 

Make the same as the above vanilla ice cream with the 
addition of one cupful of strong coffee This gives a 
strong flavor. Less can be used. The second cupful of 
suorar should be large. 



A Few Words on the Subject of Lunches and Dinners. 

If Americans would graft upon their primitive habits 
such conservative additions as comport with the genius of 
their country, it would be well. Half a century ago, five 
courses for a state dinner were enough and to spare. 
To-day fifteen are indulged in. After seven, each succes- 
sive course becomes more and more a weariness of the 
flesh. A shrewd observer said of a well trained English 
waiter, " it took a hundred years to produce him." Wait- 
ing had been his heritage, as it was his father's before him. 
Americans are too impatient and intolerant of superficial 
elegance to be patient with confused or stupid service — 
ergo, never attempt too much. We append some sugges- 
tions for courses at dinners. 

First Course. — Bouillon, Mock Turtle, White Soup, 
White Almond Soup, Black Bean, Parker House, Tomato, 
Ockra Soup, Corn Soup, Oyster Soup. 

Second Course. — Boiled Whitefish, Boiled Salmon, 
Trout, Fried Perch, Turbot, Fried Trout, Baked Pike, 
Whitefish Mayonnaise, Oyster Croustade, Fricasseed Oys- 
ters, Salmon Cutlets, Salmon Mayonnaise, Salmon Pate. 

Third Course. — Roast of Beef, Fillet of Beef, a la 
Mode Beef, Leg of Veal, Broiled Fore-quarter of Lamb, 
Hind-quarter of Lamb, Saddle of Mutton. 



WHITEFISH MAYONNAISE. ' 28S 

FouKTU Course.— Saddle of Veuison, Venison Steaks, 
Roast Turkey, Boiled Turkey. 

FiFTu CouBSE. — Partridges, Quails, Canvas-back Ducks, 
Venison Pasty, Snipe, Teal, etc. 

Sixth Course. — Salad, Celery, with Mayonnaise Dress- 
ing, Salad, with French Dressing, Water Cress, etc. 

Seventh Course. — Deserts, Creams, Ice Creams, Jellies 
at Discretion, Burnt Almonds. 

Eighth Course. — Fruit, Coffee, Confectionery. 

811 A Whitefish Mayonnaise. 

Boil a fish according to receipt No. 64; carefully take 
out the bones, leaving the fish in pieces large enough for 
a helping; pile into shape on an oval platter; make a 
mayonnaise dressing according to No. 269, only with less 
onion, Let both fish and dressing get very cold, and just 
before serving pour the latter over the fish, then sprinkle 
a few capers. This receipt may be followed for pike, bass- 
lake trout or pickerel, but as these are less delicate fish use 
a sauce, tartare receipt. No. 93. This makes a fresh and 
nice fish course.

288 ALLOWANCE OF SUPPLIES. 

Allowance of Supplies for a Private Enter- 
tainment. 

In inviting guests, it is safe to calculate that out of one 
hundred and fifty guests but two-thirds of tliat number 
will be present. If five hundred are invited, not more than 
three hundred can be reckoned on as accepting, many invi- 
tations to so large a company being in a measure perfunc- 
tory and declined in the same spirit. 

Allow one quart of oysters to every three persons pres- 
ent; five chickens, and fifteen or twenty heads of celery 
(or what is better, a ten-pound turkey, boiled and cut), 
are enough for chicken salad for fifty guests; one gallon 
of ice cream to every twenty guests; one hundi-ed and 
thirty sandwiches for one hundred guests; six to ten quarts 
of jelly for a hundred. 

Allowance for a Public Entertainment. 

The lady managers of the Home of the Friendless and 
Thompson Home for Old Ladies personally prepare and 
contribute a supper for the Harvest Home of each institu- 
tion. These suppers have become quite celebrated because 
of the dainty cooking and equally dainty service. No 
money is expected to be made from them, but they are a 
source of intelligent knowledge of the Homes to hundreds 
and thousands of our fellow-citizens who only by this 
means come to an acquaintance with our children and old 
ladies. We give a list of supplies for each entertainment.
