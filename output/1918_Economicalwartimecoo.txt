Economical War -Time Cook Book 



SEVEN COMMANDMENTS FOR WAR-TIME 

CONSERVATION 

PREPARED AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY, ITHACA, N. Y. 

1. Set aside enough money to buy 1 quart of milk a day for each 

child and | quart of milk a day for each grown person. 

The grown person may use some cheese in place of all milk; 

1 A ounces of cheese will replace | quart of milk. 
If there is not enough money to buy this amount of milk, try 

to buy at least 1 pint a day for each child and | pint a 

day for each grown person. 
The grown person may use skim milk. Half of the daily 

quart for the child may be skim milk, if necessary; but it 

is not best to feed the child skim milk. 
Children suffer more from lack of milk than do grown 

persons. 

2. Buy 2 to 3 ounces of some fat for each grown person. 

Children will not need as much as this if they are getting a 

quart of whole milk a day. 
The best fat is butter, particularly for little children. 

3. If money is scarce, buy only enough sugar to make the meals 

palatable. 

One and one-half ounces, or about 3 level tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, honey, molasses, or sirup a day for each person will 
do this. 

Sugar is not a necessary food; too much money spent for 
sugar is likely to deprive the family of more needed foods. 

4. Buy for each day some potatoes and one other vegetable 

such as cabbage, onions, carrots, turnips, beets, or other 
available fresh vegetables. 

The children can eat daily 2 to 3 medium-sized potatoes and 
J to I pound of one of the other vegetables. 



4 Economical War-Time Cook Book 

The grown persons can eat daily 6 to 8 medium-sized 
potatoes and | pound or more of the other vegetables. 

5. Buy only as much wheat and wheat products as the Food. 

Admmistration rulings allow. 

The rest of your need for cereal food may be satisfied by such 
other cereals as rolled oats, pinhead oatmeal, cornmeal, 
hominy, barley, rice, and buckwheat. 

If possible, buy flours, meals, and breakfast foods made from 
the entire grain, such as water-ground cornmeal, rolled 
oats or oatmeal, cracked wheat, graham and whole-wheat 
flour. They have greater food value than have the re- 
fined products. 

Less bread and other cereal foods are needed, if some dried 
beans or peas are eaten and if potatoes are used freely. 

One serving of dried beans or peas or one medium-sized 
potato may replace one serving of cereal or one slice of 
bread. 

6. If some money still remains, buy a little fruit for each mem- 

ber of your family. 

Apples, fresh or dried, and dried prunes and raisins are 
among the cheapest fruits. 

7. If there is more than enough money for this necessary food 

for all members of the family, spend it to increase the 
variety and flavor of the meals. 

The plain but safe diet resulting from following rules 1 to 6 
may be made more palatable by spending more money. 

Meat may be added for grown-up members of the family. 

Eggs may be added for all members of the family. 

The amount of money to be spent for milk, cream, butter, 
cheese, fruits, vegetables, fats, and sweets may be in- 
creased. 

This more expensive diet may be more pleasing but not more 
wholesome than the first one suggested. 

List of foods necessary to use sparingly: 

Meat. Sugar. 

Wheat. Fat. 



Wheat Substitutes and How to Use Them 5 

List of foods from which we may select as freely as the actual 
needs of the family demand and our means allow: 

Milk. Poultry. 

Cheese. Eggs. 

Butter for the table. Game. 

Vegetable oils for cooking. Vegetables. 

Fish. Fruit. 

Oysters. Cereals other than wheat. 

All sea foods. Dried peas, beans, etc. 

SUBSTITUTES FOR WHEAT AND HOW TO USE THEM 

Cornmeal and com flour: As mush with milk, also fried; 
as gnocchi (with cheese, eggs); as plain polenta with cheese; 
in yeast bread and rolls; in gingerbread, pastry, cream puffs, 
eclairs, small cakes and cookies; in muffins, baking-powder bis- 
cuit, waffles, spider corn cake, southern beaten biscuit, Virginia 
spoon corn bread; baked Indian pudding; custard souffle; Bos- 
ton brown bread; for coating fish and tripe to saute. 

Hominy: As breakfast cereal; hominy balls, fried, eaten 
with meat or chicken sauce, or as a dessert with syrup; Virginia 
spoon corn bread. 

Samp (broken kernels of corn) : As breakfast cereal ; in 
cream sauce with scraped onion and chopped parsley; in cream 
sauce with cheese, as hearty luncheon or supper dish; in tomato 
or chicken sauce with cheese. 

Barley flour: In bread, rolls, muffins, pastry, cake; in bread 
and pastry, can be used in larger proportion than corn flour, but 
do not try more than one-third barley to two-thirds wheat in 
yeast mixtures. 

Rice: Plain boiled with meat sauce or milk; with curry 
sauce; with tomato, broth and cheese, flavored with onion, 
etc.; rice croquettes, cheese sauce; sweet rice croquettes for 
dessert; plain rice croquettes with rich pudding sauce; plain 
rice pudding with milk and raisins; baked custard rice pudding; 
Delmonico rice pudding with meringue; boiled with hard sauce; 
Turkish pilaf; to thicken soup; to thicken any meat stew; 
plain boiled with boiled fowl, veal, lamb, pigeons, etc.; rizzoletti; 
griddle-cakes and muffins; yeast bread. Rice flour is used in 
bread, cake, and pastry. 

Oatmeal: Breakfast cereal; in yeast bread and biscuit; 
in baking-powder biscuit, muffins, griddle -cakes, scones; in 



6 Economical War-Time Cook Book 

macaroons; in cookies; in Scotch bannock; to thicken soup; 
to thicken fish, nut or bean loaf. Oatmeal may be ground into 
fine flour in a coffee mill or with the nut cutter of a food chopper. 
It may be used in cake or pastry as well as in bread. 

Buckwheat flour: In griddle-cakes, biscuit, muffins, cookies, 
bread. 

Potato flour: Has by bulk twice the thickening properties 
of wheat flour; very little fat in composition; use in sponge 
and small cakes; to thicken soup and sauces. 

SUBSTITUTES FOR MEAT 

Milk, cheese, eggs, fish of all kinds, dried peas and beans, 
poultry, game, nuts. 

PERMISSIBLE FATS 

Drippings from such meat as is cooked. 
Fat from poultry. 
Vegetable oils. 

Nuts. 

SUBSTITUTES FOR SUGAR 

Molasses, honey, maple sugar and syrup, raisins, figs, dates, 
prunes; bananas, grapes, pears, peaches, beets, parsnips, squash, 
sweet potatoes, etc., supply considerable sugar, and might be 
used to partially satisfy a desire for sweets. Corn syrup, while 
having practically no sweet taste, may be used to some extent 
as a substitute for sugar. 

VICTORY BREAD 

Of all the grains, wheat contains the strong, elastic gluten 
in the best proportion for loaves of light, spong^^ yeast bread; 
rye also contains a goodly proportion of gluten, and will make 
satisfactory yeast bread. The other grains must be combined 
with wheat when the lightness of the loaf is secured with yeast. 
The United States Food Administration allows the name of 
" Victory Bread " to be applied to any bread containing twenty 
per cent or more of wheat substitute. Twenty-five per cent of 
any variety of substitute flour will give good results, and often 
one-third of the full quantity of flour may be a substitute flour, 
if the bread is to be eaten within a day or two. 



Wheatless Breakfast Cereal Dishes 7 

WHEAT SUBSTITUTES IN QUICK BREADS 

In breads made with baking powder, baked as soon as mixed, 
the proportion of the wheat substitute flours may be materially 
increased. While many are at their best when made on the 
50-50 basis, most of them may be made quite successfully with- 
out any wheat flour, and some of them, no matter how much 
wheat flour be available, are always made without it. 

WHEAT SUBSTITUTES IN CAKE AND PASTRY 

Either barley or fine oat flour makes good pastry; a little 
rice flour with the barley flour is thought by most people an im- 
provement. Sponge cake may be made with most any variety 
of flour; potato flour gives even better sponge cake than wheat. 
In recipes calling for one cup of wheat flour, use half a cup of 
potato flour. Probably good results may be secured with any 
of one's favorite cake recipes, if rice flour be substituted for one- 
third of the wheat flour called for; the other two-thirds of wheat 
flour 'being retained. In the sponge cake the half cup of 
potato flour is all the flour that is required. 

Barley flour works well in layer cakes with chocolate and 
soda; barley, buckwheat and oat flours make good cookies and 
ginger cakes; barley and corn flour good cream cakes and 
eclairs, though not as puffy as when made of wheat flour. 

All measurements are level. Flour is sifted before measur- 
ing. 



WHEATLESS BREAKFAST CEREAL DISHES 



CORNMEAL-AND-OATMEAL MUSH 

Cornmeal mush and oatmeal are good only when well 
cooked. Many people use too little salt and cook them too 
short a time. To cook cornmeal mush for five people, use one 
and one-half cups of cornmeal, two teaspoonfuls of salt, five or six 
cups of water. Bring salted water to a boil. Stir in the corn- 
meal slowly. Don't let it lump. Cook it at least thirty min- 
utes. It is better when cooked for three hours, or overnight. 
Use a double boiler on the back of the stove, or a fireless cooker. 
Cooked in skim milk instead of water, it is particularly good. 



8 Economical War-Time Cook Book 

and the food value of the dish is nearly doubled. For oatmeal, 
use two and one-half cups of rolled oats, two and one-half tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, five or six cups of water. Bring the water to 
a boil. Stir the rolled oats slowly into the boiling water and 
cook for one hour, or overnight. Eat the cereal with milk or 
syrup or butter or butter substitutes. 

CORNMEAL-AND-OATMEAL MUSH WITH GRATED 
CHEESE 

(For Adults) 

Prepare the mush as above; just before serving stir in from 
one to two cups of grated cheese, and sprinkle cheese over the 
mush after it is in the serving dishes. 

PLUM PORRIDGE 

Sprinkle a cup of large raisins in the water in which oatmeal 
is to be cooked, then stir in the oatmeal; when the oatmeal is 
cooked, the raisins will be done. No sugar is needed in serving. 

OATMEAL WITH DATES 

Cover half a pound of dates with boiling water; let boil 
once, then skim to an agate plate, set in the oven two or three 
minutes to dry, then cut in neat lengthwise quarters, discarding 
the seeds. Serve around or over the oatmeal with milk from the 
top of the bottle.

Victory Breads 17 



VICTORY BREADS 

When less than one cake of compressed yeast is given in a 
recipe, the bread is to be mixed at night. 

In general, most housekeepers prefer to mix bread at night, 
using a small quantity of yeast. In this way the bread is baked 
and out of the way in the early morning hours. A coal fire is 
often regulated more easily in the morning and this is an object 
in baking. However, many times, better results are secured 
when making yeast bread with cereals of low, or weak, gluten 
content, if a sponge be made in the morning with wheat flour, 
and then, when this is fully risen, adding the weaker flour with 
such other quantity of wheat flour as is required. Good bread 
may be made of first quality rye flour without the admixture of 
any wheat, but for less choice products a little wheat flour is 
advisable when conditions are favorable for its use.

These cutlets may be made of almost any variety of fresh 
or canned fish. If fresh fish is used, be careful to remove from 
the liquid or heat as soon as the flesh flakes easily. Make a 
sauce of \ cup of fat, \ cup of barley flour, \ teaspoonful of salt, 
and 1 cup of milk or fish broth, with \ cup of cream; fold in 
nearly 2 cups of flaked fish and turn on a plate to cool. Form 
into cutlet shapes, coat with beaten egg, diluted with 4 table-

FLOUNDER-AND-OYSTER SANDWICH 

To serve three or four people, buy 2 flounders of a little 
more than a pound each. This will give four filets weighing one 
pound. Have the skin and bones sent with the filets of fish; 
also purchase half a pint of oysters. Put the fish trimmings 
over the fire with a few celery leaves, half an onion, sliced, and 
a few slices of carrot and cold water to cover. Let cook half 
an hour, then strain off the liquid. Rub over a fiat piece of tin 
vath fat; on it set one of the fiJets, seasoned with salt. Pour 
^ cup of cold water over the oysters. Take up an oyster to 
remove any shell that is present, dip in melted fat, then in 
cracker crumbs and set on the fish; repeat until the fish is 
covered ; set a second filet of fish over the oysters, cover this 
with oysters as before; repeat, having a filet of fish above the 
whole; set strips of pork above the fish; strain the oyster liquid 
into the fish broth; pour a little of the liquid around the fish. 
Let cook about 35 minutes. Remove the pork, sprinkle with 
cracker crumbs, mixed with vegetable oil, and return to the 
oven to brown the crumbs. Serve with a sauce made of the 
rest of the fish broth. 

BROILED SALT MACKEREL

CREAMED FINNAN HADDIE, MEXICAN STYLE 

The whole fish or canned flakes of fish may be used. The 
whole fish must be cooked first and should be made ready in 
advance. Set to cook on the back of the range, flesh side down- 
wards, in cold water; after half an hour draw the saucepan for- 
ward and let heat gradually to the simmering point. Let sim- 
mer about 6 minutes, then drain and separate the flakes from 
the skin and bones. For each cup of flakes prepare a cup of 
cream sauce ; stir into the sauce half a teaspoonful of fine-chopped 
chili pepper, then add the fish. This is particularly good with 
baked potatoes. 

LITTLE FISH PIES 

These are made of mashed potato and " left-over " fish. 
Rub over earthen ramekins with vegetable oil, press potatoes, 
mashed and seasoned as for the table, into them to line with a

boiling, then pour over the fish and return to the oven to cook 
15 minutes longer. 

CREAMED CODFISH IN POTATO PATTIES 

Season hot mashed potato as for the table, but keep it 
quite firm. Beat very thoroughly, then press into a buttered 
baking pan to make a sheet a generous half-inch in thickness. 
When nearly cold cut it into rounds with a French patty cutter. 
Stamp out the centers from half the rounds to make rings, and 
score the other half with the same cutter. Take out a little of 
the potato inside the scoring. Lift the rounds to a buttered 
baking sheet, and set a ring above each round, thus forming 
cases. Brush over with the beaten yolk of an egg diluted with 
a little milk, and set into the oven to become very hot. Prepare 
a cup of creamed codfish ; add to it the rest of the egg-yolk and 
milk, and when the egg is set, serve in the potato patties. 

CREAMED CODFISH 

Ij cup salt codfish \ teaspoonful black pepper 

2 tablespoonfuls butter substitute 1 cup milk 

2 tablespoonfuls barley flour 1 egg, beaten light 

The codfish should be picked in bits and left to stand several 
hours or overnight in cold water to cover. Let heat to just 
below the boiling point or until the water looks milky; drain off 
the water. Melt the fat; in it cook the flour and pepper; add 
the milk, and stir until boiling; add the fish and beat in the egg.

with fat. Put in the mixture. Let cook in a dish of boiling 
water (as a custard) without boiling the water, until firm in the 
center. Unmold. Garnish with a cold, boiled egg cut in eighths 
lengthwise. Serve drawn butter sauce in a bowl. 



How to Extend Meat Flavor 35 

HOW TO EXTEND MEAT FLAVOR 

We have become very fond of the flavor of meat, especially 
that of roasted and broiled meats. We may make many bland 
foods, or those of less characteristic flavor than meat, more ap- 
petizing by giving them meat flavor. There are various ways in 
which this can be done, as, â 

First, browning meat in a little fat before setting it to cook 
with onions, carrots, potatoes, etc., in a close-covered dish (cas- 
serole). We may cook the meat with the vegetables without 
browning it, but browning the meat intensifies the flavor, and, 
as fat is a good carrier of flavor, a small piece of meat thus treated 
will serve the purpose of a larger piece of meat not so treated. 

Second, water in which bones and trimmings from roast 
meats, vegetables, seeds, and sweet herbs are simmered (to 
dissolve into it browned juices of the meat adhering to the 
bones, etc.) may be used to flavor soups with a foundation of 
cereals and vegetables. 

Third, by cooking with the vegetable forming the body of 
the soup, a ham bone or a few slices of bacon or salt pork. 

Fourth, when roasting a piece of meat serve it the first day 
with no sauce save that of its own juice (platter gravy) or a 
cream sauce (made of milk), with onions or some other vegetable. 
Pour off the fat from the roasting-pan ; add a cup of hot water 
and let simmer to dissolve into the water all the browned juices 
on the pan, â reserve this for a sauce to use with the meat 
when cold or for the body of a soup at a later day. 

SOUP FROM BONES OF ROAST FOWL 

Remove all bits of meat from the bones for other use. 
Separate the bones at the joints; add to them all browned skin, 
also neck and giblets with skinned feet, if not already used. 
Cover with cold water, and set over the fire. Melt 3 tablespoon- 
fuls of chicken or other fat, sHce into it 1 onion, 3 stalks of celery 
and a scraped carrot; add 3 branches of parsley and a blade of 
mace, cover and let cook (stirring occasionally) about 20 minutes, 
or until softened and yellowed slightly. By covering the dish, 
the vegetables will steam in the fat and their own moisture; 
add to the bones with a cup of left-over canned corn, if at hand, 
and let the whole simmer very gently about 1 hour; take out the 
bones and press the rest through a fine sieve. This broth may 
be used iij making almost any variety of unclarified soup. By

Cook the carrot, celery, and onion in the fat, covered, 
stirring occasionally over a very moderate heat about 15 minutes. 
Cook the potatoes in boiling water 5 minutes, drain, rinse in 
cold water and drain again. Add the potato to the other vege- 
tables with the water or broth, and let cook nearly 1 hour; 
add the meat extract, if used, with salt and pepper to season. 
There should be four scant cups of soup. 

OATMEAL SOUP 
Have 1 quart of broth made from chicken bones, etc., boil- 
ing over the fire; sprinkle in 3 tablespoonfuls of quick-cooking 
oatmeal, stirring constantly meanwhile, and let boil 5 minutes;

fat. Add boiling water just to cover the potato. Bake in a slow 
oven nearly 3 hours. More water may be added if needed. 

USES FOR COLD MASHED POTATO 

If the mashed potato is carefully prepared, well seasoned, 
light and fluffy, the potato cakes, when reheated, either on a 
greased dish in the oven, or in the frying pan in a little hot fat, 
ought to be about as satisfactory as when first served. Any 
sort of cooked fish may be mixed with the potato. Finnan 
haddie, salmon, haddock, halibut, mackerel or codfish (fresh 
or salt) may be used. For frying, pat the cakes in a little barley 
or corn flour before setting them to cook. 

Cold mashed potato may be added to biscuits, doughnuts, 
or bread. For doughnuts use half a cup to about two cups and 
a half of flour. Mix the potato with the eggs and sugar. Rather 
more potato may be used in biscuits and bread. In bakings 
powder biscuit, use two teaspoonfuls of baking powder for each 
cup of potato besides the quantity taken for the flour. Mashed 
potato may be used with onion and celery in a cream soup.

Salads 43 

of lettuce and dispose the prepared prunes above ; pour the dress- 
ing over the whole and serve at once. If the salad seems dry, 
prepare a little more dressing. This dressing is good on lettuce 
served without fruit, and is particularly good on a grapefruit or 
orange salad; use the juice of the fruit with the juice of half a 
lemon. 

LIMA BEAN SALAD 

Soak 1 cup of Lima beans in cold water overnight. Wash

A SHORT CUT IN RICE PUDDING 

Boil rice after the method approved by yourself, so that it 
will not be gluey, but each grain separate and light. While 
it is cooking stew some seedless raisins in a little sugar and water. 
The raisins must be swelled and soft; then over the cooked 
rice, on serving it, turn the stewed raisins and some evaporated 
milk from a can. The milk gives the same creamy, long-cooked 
flavor that is liked in rice baked a long time in fresh dairy milk, 
and often called " Poor Man's Pudding." 

BAKED INDIAN PUDDING 

This recipe has been handed down from the days of the 
early settlement of this country. The recipe was used for pud- 
dings baked in the big brick oven of a farmhouse in New Bed- 
ford, Mass. The land on which the house stood was purchased 
of the Indians. The original deed given by the Indians is still 
in the possession of the family.

tana or large plump table raisins. Remove the seeds from the 
latter if objectionable. Cover the raisins with boiling water and 
let cook until the pulp is tender and the water is evaporated to 



Economical Dessert Dishes 47 

two or three spoonfuls. Sprinkle the rhubarb, raisins, sugar, 
and syrup in a baking dish in layers, and let cook in the oven 
or on top of the range until the rhubarb is tender but not bro- 
ken. For a change, use prunes instead of raisins.

Cut each pulp in halves crosswise, then lengthwise, to make four 



50 Economical War-Time Cook Book 

pieces of each banana. Pat both sides of each piece in barley 
or corn flour, then set to cook in one or two tablespoonfuls of 
hot fat. When browned delicately on one side, turn and brown 
the other side. Keep the slices light in color and do not cook 
too long. Serve at any meal. They are particularly good with 
bacon, chops, hash, cutlets, or croquettes. 

BANANAS BAKED FOR A VEGETABLE 

Pull down a section of a banana skin, and loosen the pulp 
from the rest of the skin; remove all coarse threads, then re- 
place the pulp in the skin. Bake in an agate pan in a quick

and the pulp is soft. The length of time needed will depend on 
the heat of the oven, probably about 20 minutes in a moderate 
oven. At least an hour before serving set the cleaned raisins 
to cook in the boiling water, adding water as needed. Mix and 
sift together the sugar and cornstarch, and stir these through 
the raisins and water; stir until boiling, then let simmer ten 
minutes and add the butter and flavoring. Remove the bananas 
from the skin to a hot plate (they may be coiled in a half circle). 
Pour over the sauce and serve at once. These may be used as

one at a time, press below the surface of the chocolate, then lift 
out and drop on to a piece of table oilcloth. If the chocolate 
is of the right temperature, it will not run from the nut and will 
hold the shape given it by the dipper. If too warm, beat until 
the right temperature is secured.

CHOU PASTE FOR CREAM CAKES AND ECLAIRS I 

5 cup butter or substitute | cup corn flour 

1 cup boiling water 3 large eggs 

I cup barley flour 

Crisco or clarified chicken fat are choice substitutes for 
butter. One fourth cup of rice or potato flour may replace 
the corn flour. Let the fat and water boil in a saucepan; then 
quickly sift in the flour, and stir to a smooth paste that leaves 
the sides of the saucepan. Turn the paste at once into a bowl, 
break in 1 egg and beat it into the mixture thoroughly; when 
the paste is smooth beat in another egg, and so continue until 
all the eggs are added. Vigorous beating throughout the whole 
time is essential. The finished paste should be warm, light, 
and soft, but not soft enough to run; it should hold its shape 
when set into the baking pan with teaspoons or pastry bag and 
tube. 

ECLAIRS 

Shape the paste on a buttered baking sheet in strips about 
four inches long and one inch wide. Bake in an oven hot on the 
bottom about 25 minutes. Chou paste is baked when it feels 
light on being lifted in the hand ; it often slides on the pan when 
baked. Open at one side and insert a teaspoonful of English 
cream. Cover the smooth side with a chocolate frosting.

paste for one large pie and two or three tarts. Clarified chicken 
fat makes good pastry. 

This is good tasting pastry. It is handled, or rolled, more 
easily if left to stand overnight, covered, in a cool place. 

POTATO PASTRY 

I cup flour 5 cup mashed potato 

J teaspoonful salt 4 tablespoonfuls shortening 

5 teaspoonful baking powder 

Sift together the dry ingredients, and combine them with 
the potato. Cut in the fat in the usual way, and roll out the 
pastry. This recipe makes enough for a one-crust pie. The 
crust may be baked before the filling is added. 

COTTAGE CHEESE PIE 

1 cup cottage cheese Yolks of 2 eggs, beaten 

I cup maple syrup 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter 

\ cup honey Salt 

I cup milk I teaspoonful vanilla 

Mix the ingredients in the order given. Bake the pie in one 
crust. Cool it slightly, cover it with meringue, and brown it 
in a slow oven.

LEMON CHEESE PIE 

1 cup cottage cheese 2 tablespoonfuls butter 

Â§ cup honey or | cup corn syrup 2 tablespoonfuls cornstarch 

1 egg-yolk, beaten Juice and grated rind of 1 lemon 
f cup milk 

Heat the milk, add the sweetening and the cornstarch 
mixed together, and cook the mixture until it is thick, stirring it 
constantly; cover and let cook, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. 
Add the egg and cook until the egg thickens. Add the cheese, 
butter, juice and rind of the lemon. Pour the mixture into a 
well-baked crust; cover with meringue and let cook in a slow 
oven about 12 minutes. 

MERINGUE FOR CHEESE PIES 

2 egg-whites, beaten very light 1 teaspoonful granulated sugar 
4 tablespoonfuls maple syrup or honey 

Gradually beat the syrup or honey into the beaten egg- 
whites. Spread over the pie; dredge over the granulated sugar. 

SOUR MILK PIE 

1 cup buttermilk or thick clabbered milk f cup maple syrup 

2 tablespoonfuls cornstarch, mixed with 4 2 egg yolks, beaten 

tablespoonfuls cold water 1 lemon, juice and grated rind 

1 tablespoonful melted butter 

Heat the milk in a double boiler. When it is warm, add 
the cornstarch mixed with cold water. Cook the mixture until 
it is thick, and add the other ingredients. Cook the mixture 
until it is clear. Turn it into a baked crust, cover it with 
meringue, and bake in a slow oven 15 minutes. 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Turn thick, sour milk into a bag and let hang to drain. In 
about twelve hours, the whey will have drained from the curd. 
Turn the curd into a bowl. To each pint, add half a teaspoonful 
of salt and | cup or more of thick, sweet cream. Mix together 
thoroughly and press into an earthen bowl. Set aside in a cool 
place. When ready to serve, turn from the bowl. 

This cheese is much better when made without heating the 
milk over hot water. To hasten souring let the milk stand in a 
warm place, not in refrigerator.

CANNING 



METHODS OF CANNING 

For home canning, two distinct methods of procedure are 
in general use: (1) Cooking in a saucepan and then transferring 
the article to the sterilized cans, and (2) cooking the product in 
the jar in which it is to be stored. 

Bulky foods, like spinach and beet greens, hard fruits, like 
apples and quinces, and foods in which there is considerable 
waste, as beets, are canned more easily, if the process is, at least, 
begun in a saucepan. Berries, peaches, pears, peas, asparagus, 
carrots, tomatoes, and string beans retain their flavor better if 
canned in the receptacle in which they are to be stored. (Cold 
pack.) 

CANNING WITH A SAUCEPAN 

In canning food with a saucepan, the food, prepared as 
when to be cooked for the table, is cooked until tender. Some 
time before the food is set to cook, the jars, covers, and all uten- 
sils (as spoons, ladle, and funnel) that are to be used, are set into 
a saucepan of cold water on the bottom of which is a rack or many 
folds of clean cloth; the jars are filled with water, and the whole 
is brought slowly to the boiling point and kept at just about 
this point for ten minutes or longer. When the food is cooked 
and is actually boiling, turn the water from a jar, set the jar on 
a cloth, wrung out of hot water and folded, near the saucepan, 
and fill it with the hot food; dip the rubber ring (which must 
be new and pliable) in boiling water and set it in place; take a 
silver knife from the boiling water and move it around in the 
jar to break up bubbles of air that may be present; add more 
boiling liquid to fill the jar to overflow; lift the cov^er from the 
boiling water without touching the inside of it, set it in place 
fasten securely, and lift the jar to a board. Do not let a draugh 
of air blow on the hot jar, or it may crack. Store, when cold 
in a dark place. 

CANNING WITH A WASH-BOILER, STEAM-CO OKB;R, 

OR CANNER 

A canner made for the purpose simplifies the process of 
canning. As the cooking is done under very high pressure, the 



Canning 61 

time required is materially shortened. The work is carried out 
in the same manner with the three utensils mentioned above. 
Rinse the jars in boiling water, taking care to heat them gradu- 
ally lest they break; fill the jars with the article to be canned, 
then set on the rack; put the lids of the jars beside them or in 
a pan of boiling water on the stove. Cover the large receptacle 
and let the water heat quickly to a boiling point, then open and 
fill the jars to overflow with salted, boiling water or boiling syrup, 
as is required; adjust rubbers and covers, fasten down wire, 
cover the receptacle and let cook, as required, then seal and re- 
move to a board out of all draughts. 

SELECTION AND PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR 

CANNING 

Only young, tender vegetables may be canned successfully. 
As vegetables mature, the sugar in composition is changed to 
starch; and starch is not sterilized as easily as is sugar. Let 
the vegetables be freshly gathered and crisp. Too much at- 
tention cannot be given to the point of having vegetables freshly 
gathered. No more time than is absolutely necessary for prep- 
aration should elapse between the gathering and the cooking. 
Peas, gathered and shelled the night before, lose much of their 
original sweetness. All vegetables are prepared for cooking in 
the same manner as those to be cooked for the table. 

BLANCHING 

Strong vegetables are blanched (cooked a few minutes in 
hot water and rinsed In cold water) before being packed in the 
jars. By blanching, vegetables that do not pack easily are 
softened a little and thus fit more closely in a jar. The skins of 
peaches and tomatoes are easily removed after these articles 
have been dipped an instant into hot and then into cold water. 
After these preliminaries are finished, the filled jars are set to 
cook in wash-boiler, steam-cooker, or canner. 

POINTS FOR SUCCESSFUL CANNING 

Success in canning any food depends (1) on the thorough 
sterilization of all utensils used in the process, and of the food 
itself at or above the temperature of boiling water, and (2) on 
the hermetical (air-tight) sealing of the jars or cans. 



62 Economical War-Time Cook Book 

JARS PARTIALLY FILLED 

If a jar be full of sterilized food when the sterilized cover 
is set in place, and the jar be closed hermetically so that no 
organisms from the outside may enter, the food will keep. 

CANNING WITHOUT SUGAR 

Fruit may be canned just as successfully without as with 
sugar. However, it is often a convenience when fruit is to be 
used as a sauce or relish to add the sugar at time of canning. 
Peaches and pears are not improved by re-cooking, and should 
be canned with sugar. Apples and blueberries will give better 
results both in sauce and pies if canned without sugar, and the 
sugar be added at time of use. 

If fruit juice extracted for jelly be canned boiling hot, 
jelly may be made up when it is required, a few glasses at a time, 
and when sugar is more available than when every one is calling 
for it. 

When sugar is used in fruit canning, make a syrup accord- 
ing to the following formulae : 

SYRUP FOR CANNING FRUIT 

(1) Light syrup, for canning raspberries, apples, etc.: 4 
cups water, 2 cups sugar, heat just enough to dissolve the sugar. 

(2) Medium syrup, for sweet plums and cherries: 4 cups 
water, 3 cups sugar; heat just enough to dissolve the sugar. 

(3) Thick syrup, for peaches and pineapple: 4 cups water, 
5 cups sugar; heat just enough to dissolve the sugar. 

(4) Rich syrup, for strawberries, currants, sour cherries: 
4 cups water, 5 cups sugar; boiled to soft-ball degree. 

CANNED PEACHES, " COLD PACK " 

Cut the peaches in halves, pare, and remove stones; drop 
into cold water as prepared, to keep from discoloring. Have 
the jars and covers sterilized, fill the jars with peaches, set them 
in place in the canning receptacle, pour in the hot syrup to fill 
to overflow, adjust the rubbers and the covers taken from boil- 
ing water; partially clamp and let cook from 5 to 16 minutes 
according to the style of cooker. Using a wash-boiler or similar 
receptacle let boiling water cover the cans to the depth of an 
inch and cook 15 minutes after the water boils vigorously. 
Remove from the water and fasten securely. 



Canning 63 

CANNED TOMATO PUREE 

4 quarts tomatoes (in pieces) 1 sweet red or green pepper 

1 large onion i cup parsley 

Chop the onion, pepper, and parsley; add to the tomato, 
and let simmer until the tomatoes are tender. Press through a 
sieve and measure. To each quart of puree add | teaspoonful 
salt and | teaspoonful of sugar and let simmer to the consistency 
of catsup, stirring constantly meanwhile. Pour, boiling hot, into 
sterilized cans, filling each to overflow; adjust the rubber rings 
dipped in boiling water and the sterilized covers and tighten the 
covers. Set aside in a cool place when cold. 

Use for soups and sauces. 

ORANGE AND DRIED-APRICOT MARMALADE 

Take 3 oranges, 2 lemons and | pound of dried apricots. 
Cut the oranges and lemons in quarters, and then slice each 
quarter as thin as possible. Let the apricots soak in cold water 
about half an hour, then cut with scissors in lengthwise shreds. 
Measure the fruit and allow 3 pints of cold water for each pint 
of fruit. Keep the apricots apart from the other fruit, as it will 
cook more quickly than the oranges and lemons. Let the fruit 
stand in the water, overnight. Boil the oranges and lemons 
until the peel is tender, then add the apricots and water, and 
cook about half an hour. Allow f cup of sugar or honey for each 
cup of fruit (brown sugar in whole or part may be used). Heat 
the fruit to the boiling point, add the sugar or honey and let 
cook until the mixture thickens somewhat (about 218Â° F. by 
the sugar thermometer), then store in sterilized glasses. This 
marmalade will not form a rich jelly, but is attractive in flavor. 

CANNING HARD SWEET CORN 

Sweet corn too hard for eating from the cob may be canned 
successfully, if only the pulp inside the hard exterior be used. 
With a sharp knife score the kernels down through each row on 
the ear, then with the back of the knife, scrape out the pulp 
and leave all the hulls on the cob. Use this pulp in filling jars 
to three-fourths their height; let cook in wash-boiler, steamer, 
or canner, until the pulp stops puffing or swelling after being 
stirred down. Adjust the sterilized rubber rings and covers and 
let cook about 1 hour. Seal as usual. 



64 Economical War-Time Cook Book 

CANNED BEETS 

Wash and cook the beets as for the table; drain, cover with 
cold water, and slip off the skins; pack the beets in sterile jars, 
shaking down and pressing in as many as possible. If large, 
they may be cut in slices; but small beets (two inches or less in 
diameter) are preferable. Set the filled jars in place in the 
canner or boiler, fill to overflow with boiling water, adjust the 
sterile rubber rings and the covers, and let cook 10 to 30 minutes 
after boiling begins; then fasten the covers. 

CANNED VEGETABLE SOUP 

1 cup small Lima beans (green) 1 green pepper, chopped 

1 cup cubes carrot 1 small piece bay leaf 

1 cup slices celery 1 small piece mace 

1 cup cubes kohl-rabi 4 coriander seeds 

I cup rice 3 branches parsley 

1 quart tomatoes Salt and pepper 
1 onion, chopped 

This should make two quarts of soup. Cook the beans, 
carrot, celery, kohl-rabi, and rice separately, until tender. 
Use only enough water to cover. Cut the tomatoes in bits, add 
the other ingredients, save salt and pepper, and the water in 
which the various vegetables were cooked and let simmer 20 
minutes. Strain, add the cooked vegetables, and for each quart 
1 teaspoonful salt and \ teaspoonful or less of pepper, and heat 
to the boiling point. Turn boiling hot into sterilized jars, fill- 
ing to overflow. Adjust sterilized rubber ring and the cover, 
and seal as in all canning. The vegetables must be young and 
tender. 

CANNED CHICKEN 

Cook the chicken or fowl until tender. Remove meat from 
bones and skin; pack in sterilized jars. Boil the liquid until 
reduced about one half, strain and pour over the chicken, filling 
the jar to overflow; adjust cover according to cold pack method 
and sterilize (boil) 1 hour in hot-v/ater bath.
