cream or milk. 



MAYONNAISE. 

1 tgg yolk 1 c. oil 

Vi t. salt 4 tb. lemon juice or vinegar 

f. g. pepper 

Have the ingredients and the utensils cold. Put the yolk in 
a rather small shallow dish, add the salt and pepper, and beat 
with a silver fork or a small wisk beater until well mixed. Beat 
in the oil, a few drops at a time, until the mi.xture thickens, being 
careful that each addition is well blended before adding more. 
Now alternate the oil with lemon juice, beating thoroughly each 
time. If free oil comes in contact with free lemon juice or vine 
gar, the mixture will separate. The addition of too much oil at 
once will have the same result. When all the ingredients are in, 
beat for a few minutes to make light, chill, and keep cool imtil 
ready to serve. 

If the dressing should sei)arate, begin with a new ^gg yolk, 
beating tlie separated mixture, a little at a time, into it.

DOUGHS AND BATTERS. 

Doughs containing- yeast must be kept warm if they arc to 
rise. Extreme heat will kill the yeast and prevent rising. 

Dough that rises too much will be coarse and is likely to 
sour. Work the loaf down when it has doubled its bulk and let 
it rise again if for any reason it cannot l)e i)ut into the oven whci 
ready the first time. 

]n making a large quantity of bread, it is wise to warm the 
flour ; it must not become hot. 

The box in which the bread is kept should be scalded fre- 
quently. 

WHITE BREAD. 

P4 c. lukewarm water 1 t. salt 

1 tb. l)utter ',/. cake compressed yeast or 

1 tb. sugar J4 c. liquid yeast 

3 to 4 c. sifted flour 
Mix the yeast smooth with a little of the warm water and 
add to the rest of the water with which the butter, sugar, and 
salt, have been mixed. \Vhen the butter is melted beat in about 
2 c. of flour. Beat until the mixture becomes very elastic. 
C^ontinue adding flour until the dough can be lifted out on the 
board. Knead until no longer sticky, being careful not to work 
in so much flour as to make the dough hard. Orease the inside 
of the mixing pan and ])ut in the dough, turning it once to oil 
the top. Cover and ])ut over lukewarm water or stand in a warm 
])lace and let rise to doulile its bulk. Turn out, work lightly, and 
make into a loaf. Put into a greased bread i)an, brush with fat, 
and return to a warm ])lace to rise again. When it has doubled 
in bulk bake in a moderate oven at least 45 min. 

5 hrs. arc required to make bread with the above proportion 
of yeast. If the sponge is to stand o\er night use only one-half 
as much.
