PREFACE. 



The "Blue Grass" region of Kentucky, as is well known, is 
considered the garden-spot of the State. It is celebrated for the 
fertility of its soil, the beauty of its pastures, its flocks and 
blooded stock, and last, but not least, for the hospitality of its 
people and their table luxuries. 

It is useless to eularge upon the last feature, especially to 

those who have attended Bourbon Fairs, and made visits in this 

and the adjoining counties. We only refer to it, by Avay of 

introducing our book- to the appreciation of the public. 

It is said that 

" Wbo sweeps a room 
Wiih motive pure, 
Makes that and the action fine." 

May not this also be true of a cookery-book ; in view, first, 
of its containing recipes of dishes which have often gratified the 
appetites of families and guests of some of the best housekeepers 
in this far-famed region : secondly, and by way of climax, in 
that it was conceived in the earnest desire of the ladies con- 
nected with the "Missionary Society" of the Southern Presby- 
terian Church, Paris, Ky., to do something more in the way of 
benevolence than was found practicable in the use of the needle. 

It was suggested six months ago, after mature consideration of 
ways and means, that we might not only greatly increase our 

V 



VI PREFACE. 

funds, but also contribute to tlie convenience and pleasure of 
housekeepers generally, by publishing a good receipt book. 

As soon as it was decided that we should undertake it, each 
set about collecting the best practical recipes for our purpose. 
Very many of the most noted housekeepers in other churches, 
and in different parts of the country, cheerfully contributed to 
our pages ; but, with the utmost diligence, we were not able to 
complete the work of copying and classifying until the present 
time. 

Many of our recipes are entirely original with our own famed 
cooks ; others have been gathered from the most reliable sources ; 
not one, so far as we know, has been copied from books. 

All these we carefully copied, and afterward criticised the 
proofs in such a way as to insure accuracy. 

Now that the book goes Out, full fledged, to the world, we 
solicit for it a kind reception and fair trial. In its dedication to 
the work of the church of God, we ask His blessing upon it, 
and His acceptance of its proceeds. 

Paris, Ky., Jauuai-y 1, 1875.

SOUP 



RULES ESSENTIAL IN MAKING GOOD SOUP. 

Beef is the best and most nutritious meat for making soup. 
Chicken can be used in various Avays for the same purpose, 
making a delicious and delicate soup. Pieces of cold broiled 
steak, also the bones of cold joints of meat, with a small quan- 
tity of the meat, can be made into soup with the addition of 
vegetables and proper seasoning. Always be careful to scour 
the pot thoroughly, and put the meat in cold water, which should 
heat gradually and simmer four or five hours. It should not be 
allowed to boil more than twenty minutes to cook the vegetables. 
It should be skimmed frequently. Salt and pepper to taste. 
Rice, dumplings, etc., should be added at the last to thicken. 
Vegetables, if used, should be sliced. 

CHICKEN SOUP. 

To one full growm fowl, pour on two gallons of cold water, and 
set the pot on the back of the stove, so that it may cook slowly 
for three hours. Skim several times, then place the pot where it 
will boil slowly, and thicken Avith two table-spoonfuls of flour, 
mixed with a little cold Avater. One tea cup of rice, one tea cup 
of cream or sweet milk, salt and pepper to the taste ; and just be- 
fore serving throAV in a little parsley and thyme. — 3Irs. Martin. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take a good sized .piece of beef shank, and crush the bone, so 
as to extract the marrow ; put in a pot with two gallons of cold 



SOUP RECIPES. 



water, Obsei've the same rules as given above for chicken 
soup, only cook jQour hours. About two hours before the soup 
is done, put in one quart peeled tomatoes ; one pint okra sliced, 
in another hour ; and a half hour before serving, add one 
half pint sliced Irish potatoes, one half pint tender corn. If 
the flavor of onions is liked, they must be sliced and put in one 
hour before the soup is done. Turnips also may be used, but 
should be added as soon as the water becomes hot. This soup 
may be made of cold steak. — 3Irs. Mart'm. 

PEA SOUP. 

Take one half of a fried or broiled chicken, put it in a pot 
with one and one half gallons cold water, cook slowly for two and 
one-half hours; skim well. Take one quart of pea hulls, and 
drop in Avhen the water becomes heated ; strain through a 
colander and thicken with two table-spoonfuls of flour, one cup of 
cream or milk, one-half hour before serving. Pepper and salt 
to taste. — Mrs. Matiin. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP. 

To one eg^, add a little salt and flour, enough to make a stiff 
dough ; roll out in a thin sheet, aiid dredge with flour, to prevent 
sticking ; then roll as for a dumpling, and shave down in very 
small pieces, just as you would shave cabbage for slaw. — Katy 
Desha. 

CLEAR BEEF SOUP. 

Cut up iu a pot the following ingredients : four pounds of the. 
lean of beef, two carrots, a knuckle of veal, a table-spoonful of 
butter, three small strips of pork, or sweet middling, or cold ham; 
two onions ; put the onions in whole and stick six cloves iu 
each ; one blade of mace ; pour a tea-cup of water on this and 
let it stew fifteen minutes ; then fill the pot with cold water ; 
let it come to a good boil ; carefully skimming all of the scion 
from the soup; it takes three skimmings. -After it has been 
well skimmed, set the pot on the back of the stove and let it 



SOUP RECIPES, 



boil gently six hours. About oue half luHir before serving, drop 
in a small bunch of parsley ; strain it through a cloth before 
sending to the table. Salt to the taste, and brown with burnt, 
brown sugai*. — Mrs. P., Lexington, Ky. 

OKRA SOUP. 

Cut up and skin two chickens, with two onions and tlirci 
strips of sweet middling. Fry this in a skillet; when it is done, 
pour some water on it and rinse all into a pot, filling the pat two 
thirds full of water. Put in one quart of tomatoes and let it 
cook with the soup. In a saucepan cook four pints of okra. 
AVhen the chicken in the soup has boiled long enough to bone, 
pour the soup through the colander, so as to take out all of the 
bones ; and drop in the tomatoes and the pieces of middling. Pull 
the meat or chicken into small pieces, and put back the soup to 
boil, adding the okra. Salt to the taste. — Mrs. L. Payne. 

BEEF SOUP OR TEA. 

Take one half pound of lean beef; cut in pieces as large as the 
end of your thumb ; put in cold water, one third of a pint ; let it 
soak over night. Cook the beef in two thirds of a pint of water 
gently for three hours ; pour off the tea ; dry the j)ieces of beef, 
and pound them in a mortar very fine ; then pour together the 
pounded beef, the soup, and the water in which the meat soaked 
during the night. The water and tea should be mixed while 
the tea is boiling. After the tea has boiled three hours, there 
should be as much water as when you began ; fill up \vith boil- 
ing water as it boils away. 

DELICIOUS SOUP. 

Have ready one quart of peeled tomatoes ; one half teaspoon- 
ful of soda ; let this stew until the tomatoes are thoroughly 
cooked. Have one half gallon of boiling milk, new and un- 
skimmed; pour in the tomatoes, stirring well. Let all boil to- 
gether about fifteen minutes ; season with red pepper, salt, and 
one table-spoonful of butter; just before pouring up, thicken 
with pounded crackers. — Mrs. Alice Garrett. 



SOUP RECIPES. 



SOUP. 

A little lard and flour sprinkled in the pot ; two carrots, two 
parsnips, two turnips, half a cabbage, parsley, thyme and onion ; 
then the beef, allspice and cloves pounded. Let the beef stew till 
brown ; then add boiling water, till you make the soup as strong as 
you Avish. When done, strain through a sieve ; the water from 
the Bouille is the best for the soup. — 3Irs. Brutus Clay. 

BOUILLE. 

Take the bone from the rump of the beef; put in a pot of 
water ; add cabbage, turnips, carrots, parsnips, parsley, and 
spice. Let it simmer six hours ; half an hour before dinner put 
some of the gravy in a stew pan ; thicken with brown flour and 
burnt sugar ; add the vegetables ; send the beef to table with 
the vegetables poured over it. 

GUMBO. 

Fry two chickens ; also, fry one quart of okra ; cut up four 
or five tomatoes, a lai'ge onion, and parsley to taste; while 
frying, pour in a pint or more of boiling water ; stew till you can 
pick the bones out of the chicken ; add a teacup of cream and 
one of rice boiled soft ; add cayenne and black pepper, salt, and

BAKED FISH. 

Clean the fish thoroughly, and salt it; when ready to cook, 
wash it nicely ; have i-eady some light bread crumbs ; season 
highly with pepper, salt, a few celery seed, a very little chopped 
onion, a piece of butter about the size of a walnut ; stuff your 
fish with this dressing, and place in a baking pan with Avater 
enough to about cover it ; put in a little pepper and salt, and a 
piece of butter about the size of a large hen egg, rolled in flour. 
Put inside the stove, and when it begins to cook, baste frequently 
till done. Garnish fish with hard-boiled egg, cut in rings. — 
Louisa. 

TO BAKE FISH. 

Rub the fish with salt and pepper, and a very small quantity 
of cayenne pepper, inside and out ; prepare a stuffing of bread 
seasoned with pepper, salt, thyjne, or parsley ; sew the fish or tie 
with a string; put it in a pan, and to a good sized fish allow a 
pint of water ; sprinkle with flour, and add some butter ; baste 
well ; bake slowly one and a half hours. — Katy DesJux.

TO FRY FRESH FISH. 

After having the fish nicely cleaned, season with salt and pep- 
per, and roll in flour or corn meal ; drop them in hot lard, and 
fry until brown. 

TO BOIL SALT COD. 

Soak the fish all night; change the water next morning. 
About two hours before dinner, put it on in scalding water ; 
boiling will harden it. Make a sauce of eggs and drawn 
butter. Codfish cakes can be made of cold fish, mashed jiota- 
toes and enough flour to make them stick. Make into little 
cakes and fry. 

TO BOIL FRESH FISH. 

Clean well and rub with pepper and salt, and pin it in a 
towel and drop in boiling water ; keep it boiling fast. A large 
fish will take three quarters of an hour, a small one less time. 
V/hen done, put it in a dish and dress with eggs, and drawn 
butter and parsley. Walnut and mushroon catsup are good 
with boiled fish. 

FOR A LARGE FRESH FISH. 

Wash and clean well ; have a kettle of boiling water on the 
stove ; take the fish and tie up in a cloth ; put about one 
table-spoonful of salt in the kettle; boil six eggs very hard, 
and chop up fine ; about two table-spoonfuls of butter ; one 
tea-spoonful of pepper ; one of salt, and a little mustard ; a 
little milk to make into a gravy. Pour over the fish ; if any fish 
eggs, boil them also. This is a nice fish sauce for any kind of 
fish. 

STUFFED AND BAKED FISH. 
Clean the fish and wipe dry ; rub salt inside, and pepper, 
salt and flour all over the outside ; then take stale bread and 
pound up well ; add one tea-spoonful of pepper and salt ; beat 
one egg, and add a little sage and onion ; stufi:' the fish, and 
bake about two hours, and serve with sauce as the above.

worth of oyster crackers, with which thicken the milk, making 
it about the consistency of mush; when almost cool, stir into 
it a quarter of a pound of butter, and a little suet ; fill your 
baking-dish with alternate layers of this pap and the fish, 
beginning and ending with the pap ; between each layer, grate a 
very little nutmeg; bake only until warm, for all of it has been 
cooked before. — 3frs. J. C. Ford, Lomi^ville.

liquor), and cover Avith paste (in strips.) This pie will bake 
in one ludf hour ; if in baking the crust browns too fast, put 
over it paper doubled ; if it looks dry, pour in some of the 
liquor, which must be boiled. Serve immediately, as paste is 
better when just from the oven.

MEATS. 

Meat slioulJ be kept for a day or two before being cooked, 
in order to render it more tender. Never parboil meat that is 
to be roasted. This extracts the juices and makes it insipid. 

The fire must be in proportion to the size of the article to be 
roasted ; an allowance of twenty minutes to each pound, is the 
time usually given. In summer, meat will roast in shorter time 
than in winter. Roast with a quick fire, and baste frequently. 

Salt meats, large fish, and meat for soup should be put to 
boil in cold water. 

Should poultry or meat not intended for soup be put to 
boil in cold or boiling water ? This is a question on which the 
highest authorities differ. We recommend a middle course — 
using hot, but- not boiling Avater ; boiling water contracts the 
sliin so rapidly as to toughen, and prevents impurities from 
escaping ; cover the meat with water and boil gently, one quart 
to a pound. Cover closely and skim frequently ; should the 
water become too much reduced, replenish with boiling water. 

Frozen meat should be immersed in cold water before cook- 
ing, or it will be tough. 

Boiled meat should be served as scon as ready for the table, 
or it will become sodden. 

SADDLE OF VENISON. 

Put the venison on to bake, with the side which is uppermost 
when it comes to the table next to the pan ; then make the

dressing thus : ■with the fingers crumble a small piece of light 
bread, which season highly with pepper and salt. "When the 
meat is about half done, turn it over, and cut on cither side of 
the bone several places, about two and a half inches long, which 
stuff with the dressing just made. Then pour all over the meat 
a half tea-cupful of catsup. Into a half tea-cup of black molasses 
stir a table-spoonful of whole allspice, and a tea-spoonful of brown 
sugar ; this, too, pour over the meat ; then crumble light bread 
all over the upper surface, keeping the meat well basted all the 
while, and cooking slowly, for it burns readily. Just before 
taking the venison off, put here and there all over it a little 
jelly.— J/?-s. C. S, Brent 

, BEEF A LA MODE. 

Wash and wipe a round of beef; cut out the bone, and fill

make incisions in the beef with a knife, and put in them strips 
of fat pork, rolled in the spices ; sprinkle the remainder of the 
spices over the top of the beef ; and then cover the whole with 
fat pork,' to prevent burning. Tie the beef all around with tape, 
and skewer it well, to keep it in place ; place in an oven with 
at least three quarts of water, and let it bake five or six hours, 
(a small piece will require less time.) Baste constantly with

nice hay ; add garlic, cloves, mace, allspice, thyme, and pepper ; 
let it boil several hours, until quite done, and then add about a 
quart of cider or wine. — 3Iiss Kate Spears. 

BAKED HAM. 

Wash and clean, then wrap it well in a bundle of oats, and 
boil until done, then take out and skin ; then take two flat 
sticks and lay in the bottom of the stove pan ; lay the ham on 
the sticks, and make a batter of flour and water and spread all 
over the ham. Bake about one and a half or two hours, then 
take the batter off, and dress the ham. — 3Irs. Northcutt. 

STUFFED HAM. 

After boiling the ham, skin it; have ready a dressing made 
of corn-meal muffins, hoe-cake, or grated biscuit. Add one 
moderate sized onion, chopped very fine, one or two leaves of 
sage, pepper and sugar to taste, a few celery seed. Make 
incisions all over the ham with a large knife, and press down 
the dressing. Very fine. — 3Irs. M. L. Rogers. 

TO ROAST DUCKS. 

Wash the ducks and rub with salt and pepper; put them in 
the pan and cook three hours ; toast the bread for the filling 
and crush with a rolling pin ; season highly with pepper, salt 
and chopped onion. Some persons like three or four onions

table. Basting is important in roasting meats. — 3Irs. Maiiin. 

TO ROAST GOOSE. 

Prepare as for ducks ; sage, thyme and parsley may be added 
for the stuffing ; it requires but little butter, as geese are gener- 
ally fiit. Cook three hours; pour off nearly all the fat that drips 
from the goose, as it will make the gravy too oily. Hash the 
giblets as for turkey and duck. — 3Irs. Martin. 



MEAT RECIPES. 17

pepper ; have ready a filling made of bread toasted until crisp, 
and moistened with water; season rather highly with pepper, 
butter, and a little salt ; put in a pan with one quart of water ; 
put in the gizzard, etc.; dredge well with flour, and baste fre- 
quently. It requires three hours to cook a large turkey ; a small 
one, one and a .half hours. Cut up the giblets and serve in 
the gravy, which will be sufficiently thickened by the flour with 
which the turkey was dredged. — 3Irs. Martin. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Have the turkey nicely cleaned, and let it lay in salt and 
water a few minutes ; fill with a stuffing of bread, butter, salt, 
pepper and parsley ; tie the legs and wings, and then pin up in 
a towel ; drop a little salt in the water. A large turkey will 
boil in about three or four hours ; it should be kept boiling all 
the time, but not too fast, or it will boil to pieces. Serve Avith 
drawn butter, with four eggs chopped and some parsley. Oyster 
sauce is good with boiled turkey. — Mrs. Martin. 

POULTRY. 

If you have fowls that you fear will become musty before you 
can cook them, skin an onion and put inside, with a little pepper 
and salt ; also, wash them in soda water before cooking. Some 
persons fill a small muslin bag with chai'coal and put it inside 
and hang in a cool place. 

ROAST TURKEY.

salt and water ; when cold, cover the beef with it again. This 
will cover a flour barrel of beef. — Rev. Green Clay Smith. 
DUTCH PUDDING. 

Boil the neck of the beef until perfectly tender, and the 
bones come out easily ; take it up, on a tray, and pick it to 
pieces, just as you would souse meat; skim the grease off the 
liquor, and drain the liquor off; clean the vessel ; return the 
meat and liquor ; Avhen it boils, thicken with sifted meal until 
like mush ; cook till perfectly done ; season with salt, pepper 
and sage ; mould in pans, and slice and fry brown like sausage. 
— 3Irs. Blythe, Madison county. 

WHITE PUDDING. 

To one part of beef suet, chopped very fine, add two parts of 
flour ; mix well, and season highly with salt and black pepper. 
This mixture may then either be put in skins or tied in strong 
cloth (enough for a dish in one cloth), allowing room to swell. 
It must then be put in boiling water, and boiled very vigorously 
for some time — perhaps an hour, or until the skins are tender 
Avhen pricked Avith a fork. This pudding will keep many 
months. For breakfast, cut off what seems to be a sufficient 
portion. If in skins, broil it ; if in a cloth, turn it into a pie- 
pan, and heat it. It is only good when very hot. — 3Jrs. James 
Withroiv, Lewkburg, W. Va.

VEGETABLE RECIPES. 59 



VBGBTABtiKS. 



Endeavor to have fresh vegetables, as they become tough, 
and consequently indigestible, when old. Take out all imperfect 
parts, and put them in cold water, until ready for use. Most 
vegetables should be cooked in boiling water, and should not be 
allowed to stand. If compelled to keep them back, set them in 
a steamer on the back of the stove. Never use tepid water, cold 
is preferable — but boiling water best. 

Peas and asparagus should be cooked one hour ; beans, three 
hours ; beets, two hours ; turnips, two hours ; potatoes, half an 
hour ; cauliflower should be wrapped in a cloth and boiled two 
hours, and served with drawn butter. Do not salt vegetables 
until ready to be served for the table. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Peel as many tomatoes as will cover the bottom of the pan, 
and after making an excavation in the center of each, fill with

bake two hours. 

SCALLOPED TOMATOES.

CAKES. 

Use well balanced scales, as in cake-making much depends on 
the accuracy of the weights. If fruit is to be used, prepare it 
the previous day ; sift the flour well, and use sweet butter, which 
should be well washed in cold water, to extract the salt ; should 
cream of tartar or soda bi& used, sift carefully with the flour ; 
beat the yelks of eggs and sugar first, and then the whites, until 
they adhere to a knife blade or whisk; in cakes where butter is 
used the whites must be added last ; in sponge cake the 'flour 
should be beaten in last, adding but little at a time and beaten 
in on top, and not from the bottom. Never allow' the heat to 
diminish Avhile the cake is baking, or it will fall ; when the 
cake is done, it will leave the sides of the pan, or it may be 
pierced with a broom straw near the center, and if no batter 
adheres, it is done. Sponge cake requires a quick oven. Pound 
cake a moderate heat. Fruit cake should be baked more slowly 
still. Molasses cake is easily scorched. 

In baking cakes it is a good plan to fill a large pan with cold 
water and set it on the upper grate of the stove, to prevent 
them from burning or cooking too fast on top. Let it remain 
until the cakes are baked.

14G BEVERAGES. 

TEA. 

One heaping tea-spoonful of green tea is sufficient for two 
cups. The water for making it should be boiled quickly. The 
tea-pot should be scalded well with the boiling water, and a cup- 
ful of the water poured upon the tea, and set near the fire to 
draw. In five or ten minutes, pour on another cupful of water. 
This tea will be very strong ; persons liking it weaker can easily 
add more boiling water. Black tea should be boiled, and more 
of it used than in the case of green tea, which should never be 
allowed to boil. A mixture of black and green tea is most 
pleasant to the taste. 

TO MAKE GOOD TEA. 
First procure a good article of tea. Be sure the water is boil- 
ing ; heat the tea-pot by rinsing it out with boiling water ; put 
the tea in the pot and pour on all the boiling water at one time ; 
steep over boiling water or on a warm stove, but avoid boiling 
the infusion. All teas are impaired by boiling. The weight of 
a silver dime will make three cups of tea. as strong as should be 
used ; if made too strong the flavor will be obscured. Always 
use a china or stone tea-pot. Tannin, always present in the tea, 
readily combines with metals, hence metallic tea- pots neutralize 
the flavor of tea. Connoisseurs usually prefer black tea, and 
take it without milk, but mollified Avith loaf sugar ; no other 
should be used in tea. — The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co 

CHOCOLATE. 

Allow a heaping table-spoonful of grated or pulverized choco- 
late (made into a paste with a little water) to one pint fresh 
milk ; let it come to a boil, and sweeten to taste. It is some- 
times flavored with cinnamon or nutmeg. — Mrs. Ingles.

fifteen miimtes. This quantity will make two cupfuls of coffee.

GOOD COFFEE. 

One coffee-cupful of ground coffee, one egg (yellow and 
white), beat well; mix with pint of cold water, and pour into 
the boiler ; pour in two quarts of boiling water ; let all boil 
fifteen minutes ; then set the boiler off and pour in a tea-cupful 
of cold water. — 3Irs. Northcvit. 

DRIPPED COFFEE. 

Scald the dripper with boiling water. Put three ounces of 
coffee into the upper division, and pour upon it, at intervals, a 
little boiling water at a time, until one quart has been used, 
placing the dripper where the coffee will be kept perfectly hot, 
without boiling. If the holes of the jDercolator are so large as 
to allow the water to drip through very quickly, it will be ne- 
cessary to pour it through a second time. It should be used 
with boiling milk, at table, and is usually strong enough, when 
the cup is filled one half or two thirds with boiling milk.

When the water is hot, throw a few peaches in this preparation ; 
let them remain a few minutes. When taken out, with a coarse 
towel wipe off the skins, and throw them into cold Avater. To 
half the sugar, with as little water as possible to dissolve it, add 
a layer of peaches and let boil from twenty to thirty minutes; 
then take them out and put on a flat dish to cool ; gradually 
add the rest of sugar. When all are done, boil the syrup till 
it becomes rather thick ; add while in the kettle one half pint 
alcohol, which will cool and thicken it sufficiently to pour over the 
peaches, which must be put into jars. Do not cover till next 
day. — 3Iiss Ella 31itchell. 

In preserving peaches, it is better not to peel them. Leave 
the seed in by all means.

To one pound of potash and two pounds of grease allow three 
gallons of water. Soak the potash in the Avater twenty-four 
hours, or boil until dissolved ; then add the grease, and boil un- 
til it thickens. — Mrs. Geo. Davis. 

SOAP. 

Six gallons of rain water, two and a half pounds of bar soap, 
shaved fine, two pounds of sal soda, six ounces of borax. Put 
the water on the fire with the above ingredients, and bring it to 
a boiling heat, when it is ready for use, — 3Iiss Kate Spears. 

SOAP. 

To four gallons of soft water add three pounds of soda ash, 
one and one half pounds of lime ; boil one hour and a half. 
Let the liquid stand until it can be poured off clear ; then add 
six pounds of grease. Boil it two hours and a half, and let it 
get hard in the kettle, then cut out in blocks and let dry. — 3Iiss 
Kate Spears. 

SOFT SOAP. 

Put the ashes in barrels, or a hopper, which is better. Pour 
water on every day ; drain it off", and if not strong enough, pour 
it back, or boil down till strong. Put straw in the barrels first, 
then pack ashes in ; when the lye is strong enough to strip a 
feather, put in grease until the lye ceases to absorb it. Cook 
until the soap looks thick. — Mrs. H. Brent. 



160 SOAP RECIPES. 

SODA-ASH SOAP. 

Ten pounds of soda-ash, five pounds of new lime, sifted ; boil 
in ten gallons of rain water for ten minutes, add twenty-five 
pounds of clear grease and boil two hours ; let stand until cold 
and cut out. — Mrs. Geo. Davis. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 161 



MISCB£j]L.AHBOCfS. 



POLISH FOR GRATES, OR TO PAINT BRICK HEARTHS. 

Take two or three spoonfuls of lamp black and make it into a 
smooth paste, with spirits of turpentine; then add copal 
varnish until the mixture is sufficiently thin to apply with a 
brush. This painting keeps very nice for a long time, by wiping 
it ofi' frequently with weak, tepid suds. — Rev. D. P. Young. 

TO MAKE SOAP. 

One and one half pounds unslacked lime, three pounds soda 
ash, seven gallons lye or rain water ; boil all fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Pour ofi" the lye clear, add seven pounds of grease ; 
boil two hours, or until done. Splendid soft soap. — Mrs. Taylor. 

A FINE WASH FOR THE HAIR. 

Dissolve in one quart of boiling Avater, one ounce borax, one 
half ounce of camphor. The ingredients should be finely pow- 
dered. 

FOR CLEANSING LACES. 

Pour a little pure and clear alcohol in a china bowl, or other 
deep, vessel that can be covered to prevent evajioration, into Avhich 
place the lace that is to be cleaned. Leave it some time, until 
tlie dirt has softened and settled at the bottom. Tlien, with per- 
fectly clean fingers, rub the lace gently in the liquid, until the 
stains shall have disappeared. If they can not be removed in 
this way, let soak longer. After the rubbing, squeeze the lace 



162 MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 

as dry as possible and roll in a clean towel. Take one piece at a 
time while damp, and pick it open with the fingers, pulling out 
the edge very carefully with the nails. If one can take the 
the time to open each little hole on the edge, with a pin, it will 
have much the appearance of new lace. It should be kept 
damp while handling it. When the meshes are all opened, lay 
the lace between the leaves of a book and press till entirely dry, 
taking care to fold in and out among the leaves, so as not to be 
double at any point. Sometimes lace is so much soiled as to re- 
quire a gentle rubbing in soap-suds, before using the alcohol. 
In such case, do not rinse it. Black lace can be beautifully 
renovated by the above process. — il/rs. WUhrow, Danville, Ky. 

WHITEWASH, CALLED PARIS WHITE. 

Sixteen pounds of Paris white, one half pound transparent 
glue. Cover the glue with cold water at night; next morning, 
carefully heat it, without scorching, until the glue is dissolved. 
The Paris white is stirred into hot water, until it is the con- 
sistency of milk, and then the dissolved glue is added to it. 

ITEMS. 

One tea-spoonful of vinegar in a pint of limestone water, will 
antagonize all its ill cfTects upon the bowels of those who are 
unaccustomed to it. — Dr. Hall. 

As much powdered alum as will rest on a dime, stirred in a 
pail of "water, will clear it in five minutes. — Dr. Hall. 

A FINE WASH FOR THE SKIN. 

Put two table-spoonfuls of ammonia in a basin of water. — Dr. 

Hall. 

ITEMS. 

To keep oranges, lemons, and apples, wrap close in paper, 
keep in a dry, cool place. — Dr. Hall. 

Thaw frozen fruit and vegetables in cold water. — Dr. Hall. 

Cranberries covered with water, will keep for mouths in a 
ccUar. — Dr. Hall.

WORTH KNOWING. 

One pound green copperas dissolved in one quart of water 
will utterly destroy all offensive odors. 

Ink stains should be immediately dipped in new, sweet milk. 

The sting of insects can be cured by using a paste of soda and 
water. A little powdered indigo mixed with water to a paste 
is also very good. 

A brass kettle should always be cleaned with a little salt and 
vinegar before using it. 

TO RENOVATE CRAPE VEILS.

3Irs. MoUic Webb. 

TO GLAZE SHIRT BOSOMS. 

To every quart of starch add a tea-spoonful of salt and one 
of white soap, scraped fine ; boil the starch (after adding hot

TO EXTRACT INK FROM COLORED ARTICLES. 

Drop tallow on the stains, and then soak and rub the same 
with boiling milk. 

TO KEEP EGGS FOR WINTER USE. 

One pint of lime, one pint of salt, three gallons of water. 

TO REMOVE STAINS FROM MARBLE. 

Apply oxalic acid diluted with water, and rub well. If the 
marble is only slightly stained, it need not be very strong. 

TO CLEAN STAIR RODS. 

Diji a cloth in coal oil, then in flour of emery, and rub 
well ; then rub off Avith another cloth or a piece of i^aper, 

INK.

the dresses in while hot, and leave until cold ; in this way the 
colors are rendered permanent. 

WASHING CLOTHES. 

Take one pound of washing soda, ten ounces of fresh lime to 
pour over it, one gallon of boiling water ; stir Avell ; when cold, 
bottle for use. 

To a large boiler of water, put one and a half pints of the 
above, the fourth of a bar of soap. Take the clothes out of the 
tub, where they have been soaking all night, and put them into 
the boiler. Pound them often. When well boiled, put in more 
clothes ; then wash well, and scald them in the first rinsing water ; 
rinse them in this and one other water. The recipe washes 
calico beautifully, but it must not be allowed to remain long in 
the water. 

A laundress gives the following recipe for doing up collars, 
cufis, shirt bosoms, etc. : Four ounces of white gum arabic, 
pounded fine ; put into a bottle and pour over it one quart of 
water, cork tightly and let stand all night. Pour it off carefully 
the next morning into another clean bottle ; keep it well 
corked. In using this, stir to two pints of fine starch two 
table-spoonfuls of this gum arabic water. This is very fine for

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 167 

TO TAKE MARKS OFF FURNITURE. 

"White spots can be removed from varnished furniture, and 
rendered glossy, by applying alcohol Avith a sponge. It has 
nearly, if not quite, the effect of varnish and is much cheaper. 

SEALING WAX. 

Four ounces rosin, one ounce bcesAvax, one ounce Spanish 
brown, one tea-spoonful of j^laster of Paris. 

MUCILAGE. 

Dissolve four ounces of powdered gum arable in a pint of boil- 
ing water. 

HAIR OIL. 

Six ounces castor oil, two ounces cantharides, two ounces 
alcohol, one ounce bergamot. 

MATTING. 

Wash matting in salt and water to preserve it from turning 
dark. 

SAPOLIO. 

Sapolio is superior for cleansing marble stands and bureau 
tops. Dip an old tooth-brush in hot water, and with it make 
a lather of the sapolio (which can be purchased at any of the 
apothecaries). Rub hard and rinse in clean, cold water. 

TO TAKE OUT MILDEW. 

Get the driest chloride of lime, and for strong fabrics dissolve 
four table-spoonfuls of this in one half pint of water. Let the mil- 
dewed article lie in this solution fifteen minutes ; take out and 
work gently, and put at once in weak muriatic acid (one part 
acid and four parts soft water) ; for delicate fabrics the solution 
of lime should be made weaker — three or four times the quantity 
of water should be put to the lime. Let the article remain 
in five minutes, and then pour into the muriatic acid. 

A PRETTY EXPERIMENT. 

An acorn suspended l)y a tlircad, Avitliin half an inch of the 
water in a hyacinth glass, will in a few months burst and throw

out a root, and shoot upward with straight and tapering stems, 
covered with beautiful green leaves. 

VIRGINIA BRUNSWICK STEW. 

For a large family three gallons of water, to which add two 
chickens, which have been cut up, and one pound of fat bacon. 
The bacon must be cat up very fine before putting it in the 
water. As soon as the chickens are sufficiently cooked for the 
meat to leave the bones, take them out, and separate the meat 
from the bones. Return the meat to the water, then add half 
a gallon of Irish potatoes which have been boiled and mashed, 
one and a half pints of green corn cut off, one pint of green 
butter beans, one quart of tomatoes which have been skinned, 
and a good sized loaf of light bread. Season Avith black and 
red pepper, salt and butter. The bread must not be put in 
until the stew is nearly done. As soon as it begins to thicken 
it must be constantly stirred until it is done. If it should be too 
thick, add more water. Much depends on the judgment of the 
person who makes it. When properly made, no one is able to 
detect any of the ingredients. Squirrels are a very good sub- 
stitute for chickens. — Baher Blanton, Farmville, Va.

convenient to all places of interest and amusement, makes the CiBSON the 
most desirable hotel in Cincinnati for lousiness men and the traveling pub- 
lic. All Street Railroad Cars pass our House, or wituin half 
a Square of it, to and from all Railroad Depots. 

No exertion will be sjiared to make the Gihson House tirst-class in every 
respect. Soliciting a call from you and your friends when you visit the

Are a work of art. showin<; scientific knowledge and artistic pro- 
ficiencj\ Their great reputation is the result of a careful study of all 
that constitutes 

A PERFECT INSTRUMENT! 

The invention of many important improvements peculiar to them, and 
the adoption of all others of recognized value. Among the chief points 
of their uniform excellence are, a 

Powerful, Resonant and Superb Tone, 

"Which, instead of deteriorating, improves by use; purity and perfect 
evenness throughout the entire scale, and 

GREAT DURATION OP SOUND, 

■which may be modulated at pleasure, from the softest whisper to a 
majestic grandeur and power. The touch is easy, even, elastic, respon- 
sive, and the action is remarkable for pliability and precision. None 
but the best and finest materials of every kind are used in their con- 
struc'Jon, and the employment of the most experienced artisans, place 
these instruments 

IN THE FOREMOST RANK 

of the few strictly first-class Pianos made.
