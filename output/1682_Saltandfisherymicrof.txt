To 5ir James Shaen, K;^^- W Ba- 
ronet-^ His Majejlies Surveyor General of 
Ireland, and ojie of the IQngs Chief Commijji- 
oners, Managers, and Farmers^ of his whU 
^yenue of that i\jngddm. 

Honoured S I R , 

Some years fince when I had firft the happinefs of 
being known to you, and at the fame time La- 
boured under great Difcouragements in my endea- 
vours to ferve tlie Publick : You were generoufly plea- 
fed to offer me a Confiderable Employment in IreUnA^ 
which favour I had readily, and thankfully accepted, 
could I have extricated my felf from feveral Difficul- 
ties, which then did, and ilill do lie upon me. 

'Tis now my Fortune to be engaged in the Service 
of the 'B.oyal Fijhery Comfany of Engknd^ who after they 
had loft their Stock of Eleven thoufand Pounds, 
(chiefly by reafon the French took Six of their Sea veil 
Doggers, with their Ladings, c^f.) did in 3«/y, 1 680. 
Sell their Vcflels and Stores, and though they came to 
a Subfcription for a New-Stock, yet the affair would 
have fainted away again, without your afliftance, 
which hath revived it for the prefent. : 

And though I am obliged to you in this double 
Bond of Duty and Gratitude, yet the chief Motive of 
this Dedication, was indeed the fame that occafioned 
the Publilhing this Difcourfe, viz,. The greatdefirel 
have to fee this Company Fluurifh, by procuring it 
fome confiderable Encouragement , which I hope 
may, and will be done by your means. ' ^' *

AIL that are acquainted with you knowj that your 
Studies and Endeavours for many years, have aimU 
at nothing fo much? as the promoting his Majefties 
Honour and Interefl:, by the Improvement of his Re- 
venue both in Englattd and Ireland, which you right- 
ly fay muft be effeded by the increafe of Trade and 
Manufadure, to enrich his People, and make them 
Happy : I fhall therefore ufe no other Argument to ftir 
up your zeal in this cafe, * hat the beft, if not only 
way to render the King t . Kingdom rich at home, 
and formidable abroad,is by making the Fishery there- 
of confidcrable. ' ( '

.To which may be fubjoyned two DifcourfeSj the 
one about the neceffity, utility, and inftrudtions of a 
Council of Trade ; The other about the Manufactures 
of Canvas, Cordage, and Linnen to be made in Eng" 
land , as incredible means to render his Majefty, 
People, and the Fifhery Happy. 

I (hall fay no more at prefent, but that if there could 
be contrived the raifing of a fufficieiit Fund, to carry 
on this great aflfairjHeaven feems to lend us its helping 
hand, by infatuating the Councils of the Fre^ch-Ki^g, 
who while he aims at univerfai Monarchy and Trade, 
drives over hither great numbers of his poor Prote- 
ftant Subjeds, very fit to be employed in the Fifhery, 
&c. which if it thrive,is alone enough to fpoil his Pro- 
jtft, and to fccure unto England^ the Sovcraignty of 
the Seas. 

This is a noble Task, the compaHing whereof, 
would entitle the Perfons concern'd to the pubiick 
thanks of the Nation, and the Prayers of many thou- 
fands of poor People who mufl be employed therein ; 
how far your Intereft and Endeavours can contribute 
towards it, I earneftly recommend to your ferious 
Gonfjderation, and (hall always Study to approve my

^N^tural Salt, and a Bryne Pit was diicovcred in Jn^o 1670^ 

Namely a Perfon that Icarched with an Auger for Coles in 
j the Soil of William Marhtry of Marhnry y.E{i\^ lighted up* 
jon a Rock of Salt*, that which the Inftrument brought up 
I was as haifd as Allom, and as pure, and when pulverized 

became an excellent (harp Salt. Out of the Auger- hole 
I Brine flew up more fierce than if it had been f(juirted out 
1 of a London VVatcr-Engin, ufed for quenching Houfcs on 
I Fire : The Bryne proved very vigorous and (harp , beyond 

any of the Springs in other Salt-works, to which this makes 
jan accelfion. ' ' ' 

Thje which may be further confirmed, by a Narrative in 

TVanfa^iofi, N" 53. By failing in of the Ground, and loisof 
; a Bryne Spring where one formerly might have been found, 

conceived to be undermined by fubterraneous ftreams, to 

wit, in the Lord Chofmo»4ely^s Mannor ofBilklyy about the 
■year 1659. Not far from one of their Mofles, yyhich is a 
;Moori(h Ground, very ftringy and faj:, good' for Turfs, a 
'pcicc of Ground about 30 ysirds over, without any Earth- 
!^uakc, funk down with a huge N6i^, and great Oaks grow- 
Jing onit,, fell with it together; which hung firft with part 
; of their Heads out, afterwards funk further down, quite oiit 
I of fight. Into which Pit, they let down a Pitcher tycd to 
■a Cartropc, but could reach no bottom with the Ropes they 
Thad there : And according to the Judgment of perlbns pre- 
' fentj the Pitcher was carried away as in a Stream, but 

when they drew it up, it came filled with a rich Bryne. 
*Since the Pit is filled up with Water, and now doth not taft 

Salt, but a very Itttle Bracki(h.

weak, that they arc fofccd to keep it in Barraws, in Stoves 
to dry it, and to make it no fafter than they can fell ii;. 
And this is confeflfcd in Philofophical\TranJMion^ N°53. to 
be rather a fault, than an ignorance in the Boyling, to fave 
Charges either in Labour, Time or Fuell ^ for even of nicer 
Sea- Water, ( whereof 5 or 6 gallons will not yield lo much 
Salt as one of Cheshire Brine, ) may be made a hard dry 
Salt, that need not be kept in a Stove, or Box by the Firjer 

fide. 

The faid Tranfa^iortj gives an account of the manner of 
boyling the Brine into Salt at Namptwich. They boyl it in 
Iron Pans, about 3 foot fquare, and 6 inches deepv their 
Fires arc made of Staffordjlnre Pit-Coles > and one of their 
lliialler Pans is boiled in 2 hours time. 

To clarify and raife the Scum, they ufe Calves, Cows, and 
Sheeps blood, which in Philofiphical Tranfuction ^ N"" 142. is 
faid to give the- Salt ah ill favour. 

As to the goodncl^ of the Salt at Ndrthwichy it is affirmed by 
Mr. William Martir/y formerly a Salt worker, that many Sea- 
Towns of Englandy and moft parts of JreUud are furnifhcd 
with it, and it excellently favcs their Beef and Fifh. 

Traf}fa6Ho»i N° 53. Hhcjth, Query ^bout Salt is, '" 

whether the Suit made of thcle Spring?;, be more or lels 

apt to diflbivc in the Air than other Salt ? And 
Whether ithc^s good to Powder Beef and other Flefh 
'. .": with, as Fr^wfeSalt? To which 

%Anfwer is made, that Frr«c^ Salt comes not thither, tb com- 
pare the efficacy of the one with the other experimentally; 
But 'tis there aflcrted , that with it , both Beef and Bacon arc 
very well.preferved fwect and good a whole Year together : 
And this Salt is apprehended to be rather more fearching than 
French Salt ; becaufc it hath been Obferved, that Meat kept 
with this Salt, fhall be more fiery fait to the midft of it, than 
powdred Meat on Shipboard cured with Frtfwc/? Salt. 

To this we fay, that Beef may be much longer kept than 
a Year y and (hall be fofter and fuller of Gravy , . than 
if it had been cured with French Salt , as is afterwards 
aflcrted. 

'Tis alfo faid, that Chejlnre fends yearly much Bacon to Lok-- 
dvny which never had aay mark of Infamy fet on it.

I' . - O/'Chefhire Salt ., . 

'.To which 1 reply out of certain knowledge, that one 
Mr. Ciovtr^ who kept a Chandlers Shop, had Ibme Flitches 
brought up by his Brother a Carrier, that proved to be Naught, 
Rufty, almoft all Fat, ihc crime of Ckj/./V^ Bacon, and tor 
being fuch, was conceived to be wotrc than any other Ba- 
con in Er^oimd. 

The faults are but partial or particular, pofnbjy the 
ftogs might be over fed with Whey , and be faked only 
vrith Brine. 

And on the contrary, Herefordjlire Bacon, where the Swine 

■-befides Graffs, feed upon Apples, Acorn?, Mad, Beans, and 

Peafe, being Talted with Clods of Prcr(;<'j?(:r//:jr^ ^Salt, proves 

the beft Bacon in England, and is laid to be; brought up Weekly 

to the Caftle in Woodjireet. "^ -.-', ''■;- ^■^'v. '/••• ' 

The Bacon of Earns, and other Counties , falted with 
Tort-Sen, or Lenmtwgton Salt, hath alfo as good Repute. 

In tJie hidiTranfaiiion, 'tis alio ajilirmed, that hanged Beef, 
which others call Martir:rn^fs Beef, is as good and as fre- 
quent in Chejlireas any Place. 

This we (hail confirm, by a Relation imparted by the 
Learned Mr. Stretell, vho faith 

That a Chefiire Gentleman, that was minded to kill and 
ftorc up an Oxe, for his Family, did choofeonc oftheLar- 
geft, Oldeft, and Leaneft, that could be found among many : 
And after feeding him with Grafs, Hay, and Oats, from the 
beginr^in^ of Miy^ till towards Chrijimoi, the faid Oxt jiot 
being heated with Driving, was killed and falted up , the 
Chines and other pcices being but gently rubbed with 
Northwich Salt, and put into powdering Tubs, and there now 
and then as occafion required were rubbed over again with 
;Salt. „ , 

That after 14 Months keeping, a Chine of this Beef was 
Ro'afted, and proved delicious beyond compare , fulloffweet- 
nefs and Gravy, but, »noderateIy Salted , and Eat WMth a 
favour like Marrow ; the like he never expels to meet 
with, fliould the Cattle cither be driven, or the 3alt prove 



bad.

' V' .' 



SEe Tra>'p{Siiony N" 142. where there is a Narrative of 
the manner of Boyling , and an Account that about 
*I>roytvoichy within 4 Miles of Worccflir, there arc many Salt- 
Springs, particularly one in the great Pit at 'L'/'w/t^, of which 
is m^dc 4$o Bufhels of Salt in every 24 Hours, lb ftfo^ig 
that 4 Tuns of Brine make one Tun of Salt. ■ -• " »•: 

The Brine is laid to be fo ftrong, that it cannot be Bjy- 
led in Iron-Pans, neither Cad nor Wrought , becaufc the 
former breaks, and the latter is too foon Corrode J. H-.'Ti 

But this is dcnycd, and the contraiy affirmed, in a follow* 
ing part of this Diicourfc, aboout PorA/^4-SaIt. j 

Tncy fay they are therefore driven to the ufc of Leaden-' 
Pan?, 5 foot and a hslf long, and 3 foot wide, whereof the 
fides and ends are beaten up. 

Th:ir Fuel was formerly all Wood , but fince th^ Iron- 
Works in the Forrcft of Dc^n have deftroycd the W^ood 
there, &c. they cannot at any reai'onable ciilance be fup- 
plied for one quarter of a Year, and c" , now forced to uic 
Pit-Colcs, that are brought 1 3 or i4Mi!cs. • , > 

Conceining Leaden Pans, we read in Tranfalion, N° S... 
That the Sale water at Lu^ienburgh , being more grecnifh 
than white, an J not very tranfparcnt , is about the fame 
Nature, and hold with that of Hall in Saxony^ ( thcie 
being the two chief Brine Springs in Cjermaty) and hath a 
mixture of Lead with it ; Whence alio it will not be Bofjf- 
led in. Leaden Pans, and if it held no Lead at all, it would 
rtot be fo good, that Meti'I being judged to putrify the 
Liquor. 

Whence alfo the Salt of LimcnhHrghy is preferred before 
all others, that are made of Brine Springs there. 

To this Paflcige in the Tranfachions , I fubjoyn an Infor- 
mation of the Honourrble Robert Boyle., Efq*, of the Royd 
Society., to wit, t\\2ii ^t HiiU in Sn.xony ., they have a weak.

down a weak lort of Salt ready to difTolve, the which is af- 
terwards Boyle J, and makes big grained Salt-, an Experi- 
ment whereof as Dr. Hormcl^^ and others affirm , hath been 
tried before his Highneis Prince Rnperty in the Spring-Garden, 
in the prclence of Monficur Harrell the Kings Apothecary , 
and n&any others : Moreover there are a new fortof Furnaccs|for

4 or 5 times as much Copperas, Salt , Allom , c^r. may be 
made at the lame Charge, as was formerly wont to be-, an 
Experiment whereof in Boyling Copperas, hath .been tryed 
before Sir Nicholas Crijp. And the aflertion is upon good 
Grounds, believed by the Honourable ^<?i'^rf.!2o)'/tfaforefaid, 
there being two Patents granted for the fame: The Prior to 
an £»^//]/J;.Man, and the Latter to a Frerjch-Man : On occa- 
fion whereof a Difcdurfe arifing about another Patent, cra- 
ved for feparating good frefli- Water, from Salt- Water ; Mr. 
Boyle affirmed, it had been before performed by himfelf , that 
he had prefented his Majefiy with fomc bottels of^ Water fo 
made, and with the Secret, that it would be of great ufe at 
Sea in many Emergencies, yea and of Ordinary ufe in faving 
much Cask and Stowage; That all Pump-Watfs had a little 
faltnefs in thein^ and that the Waters thus ma^ , were whol- 
ibme, and no falter than Pump- Water. ' • 

■'The TranfaSiiorjy bi° 142. about Worceflerjhire Salt, hath 
not anfwered the Query about the Time of Boyling , the 
w^^ich indeed is too foon •, And if this ftrong Brine be not 
allay'd with weaker , or Frefli- Water , they are ncccflita- 
ted to put a fmall quantity of Rofin into it, to make it fraali

and cleanfe a ftrong Brine from its Scum, the Sand cannot be 
got out, and ill qualities mufl: infome meafure, remain ftttl 
in the Salt. 

Here, in Chejhire, and other Salt- Works, they ufe to cla- 
rify and raife the Scum of the Brine , by putting a fourth 
part of the white of an Egg, into a gallon or two of Brine, 
which will lather like Sopc *, a fmall quantity whereof put

whence we ha've the following Arguments , to froye 
the Excellency oj ihts kind of Salt. 

1. npHe Salt commonly made, after Boyling is dry in 4 

Jl hours time, and keeps fo without Fire tillj it 
is Sold, which may be half a year, or three quarters oF a 
year after it isjnadc, and is not fo apt to diflblveas Chejlnrt 
Salt ; Nor as that which is made, by diflblving Bay Salt, and 
clarifying it. 

2. There can be none whiter and freer fromDrofs, and it 
is a weighty Salt : A Winchefler Bu(hel being in the l^ud Tranf- 
action faid to wei^h halfa Hundred. > - ' ' ' •' -•> -*< 

3. In the time of the DHtchV^AVy this Salt was carried into 
the IVefl, where they had before none but Foreign Salt •, 
where at firft ufing , they complained it made their Mcjlc 
too Salt, which was becaufe they ufed as much of it, as of 
French Salt, confcquently it is better. 

4 It hath prefcrvc-d Flefh for long Voyages, and hot Cli- 
ma'cs, to wit, to Jamaica. 

5. iTcrrings have been falted with this Salt in Ireland, and 
brought over, which have been whiter and better tafted, than 
thofe falted with Bay Salt. 

6. Itisanordinary way in powdering of Beef, to give it but 
one fairing, to keep it the whole year. * 

7. They have a fort called GlodSalt, which is digged up 
from the bottom of the Pans with a Picker, being the ftrongeft 
kind of Salt, r.nd moft ufed for falting Bacon and Neats- 

, Tongues T It 'nakes the Bacon Redder than other Salt , and 
caufeth the rattoEatfirm. And if the Swine are fed with 
Maft, it hardens the Fat, almofl: as much as if fed vvith Peafe, 
and falted with white Salt : And is ufed by Country- \A^omcn 
to put into their Ruflnet-Pots, and as they fay, is better for

their Chccfc ; thcfc Clods arc ufed to BroyI Meat with, 
, being laid on Coles. This Tort of Salt is accounted too 
ftrong to fait Beef with , it taking away too much of its 

iwectnefs. 

Bcfides the common Salt , it is here ordinary to make 
Loaves like Sugar-Loaves of the finell of the white Salt, which 
will keep dry without a Fire. Whereas at iV^wp/w/H, they 
arc kept long in a Hot-Houie , and Baked twice or thrice 
in an Oven, and then placed on a Stove or Chimney Cor- 
ner, and covcreil with a Hofe. «k. 

Mr. W. Mar tin J that hath a Salt- Work in Staffordjhire , 
and hath had occafion to View and Survcigh all the Salt- 
Works in Chejliire , affirms, that what is all cadged concerning 
the Salt- Works in Worccfterfnre , the fame niay be done 
and laid of the Salt- Works in Chejhire.

r " ■ ! . I I . . ■ . - ^ : 

THe want of Brine-Springs on the Eaftern Coafts of 
EngUnd^ and the over dcarncfs of Foreign Salt, begat 
the neceffity of making much Salt at Sheilds , and in the 
Counties of Durham^ and Northumberland. 

The Pans there ufed are made of wrought Iron, of 18 or 
19 foot long, 12 foot broad, and 14 inches deep*, the Fewel 
being for the moft part, a fort of crufty, drolTy, mouldring 
Coal, taken from the upper part of the Mine, which if not 
fpent this way, would be for little or no other ufe, to the pre- 
judice of the CoaLMiners, and be mingled with the better 
fort of Coals, to the great dammagc of the Buyers, cfpecially 
thofc of London. 

The Sea- water they commonly at Spring-Tide let into 
Ponds called Sumps, from whence 'tis pumpt into their P?ns, 
which are fix or fcvcn times filled, and half or more every 
time Boy led away, before it becoms Salt. 

Sometimes there arc great freflies in the River of Tym , 
which impair and weaken the'Sea-v^ater , but at fuch tiffl:cs 
they do not admit the Sea Liquor into their Ponds, neither 
need they, for through want of Vcnt> they give oven work- 
ing five Mouths in a yean _^ , .

Fifh that is not intended to be preferved for long Voyages,

1. The Oxen being driven in cool, were' afterwards

cool , which was afterwards cut into 4 pound pieces , and 
were well rubbed and laltcd with Salt, and pack't into Tubs 
or Cask, with Salt between every lay. 

2. About 1 2 or 14 days after, the Meat was took out and 
permitted to dreyn 24 hours time or thereabouts, and then 
new ialted and packed up again, with Salt covering the Meat 
in the head of the cask. 

3. In the mean while the Brine remaining in the Cask, 
was Boylcd for the fpace of half an hour, and well fcummccl, 
and afterwards permitted, about a day to fettle and Cool , 
and then the top Liquor was powrcd off, and look't like 
Canary, the fediments and bottom being thrown aWiiy as

or headed up, |he Meat being now judged fufficiently falted

there is a River or Harbour o^ 5alt- water, not incumbred 
with Frefhcs, or a Bank in which to make Sluices to admit 
at fpring-Tides Sea-water into Ponds cr Receptacles, and 
where there is Coal or Turf plenty and cheap.

IN the Thilofophicd Tranfitlion^ N"* 105. w*! read that in 
F'ano's d.iys it was the reproach of our TrtinCalpines, 
( who dwelt much further towards the South than we do,,) 
that on the Rbifie there was then neither Vines, nor Oliveb', 
nor Apples, nor Sea Salt , nor FoJJilLSAi ^ but they were 
driven to the poor fhift of ufmg the afhes of burnt-wood 
for their Salt. 

Dr. Beale^ in that TranfaCiion further faith , wc have for- 
merly made hard fhifts for it in Ennjand'^ and that atWyre- 
water in Uinc^J! >f, Salt is gathered out. of heaps of Sand 
ii'ong the Sea-fidc in many places*, upcn which fand (laith 
Speed ) the People powre water until it gets a faltilh hu- 
mour, which they afterwards Boyl with Turf, till it bc- 
eomcs white Salt. 

A Letter (rom 11 Chefl) ire Salt- Worker, gives the following 
account of it. 

Namely, that through Sluccs in the Sea Banks, chiefly at 
fpring Tides, they let Sea-water into Ditches and Trenches 
from whence they fprinkic it, or lave it upon level Beds of 
5and, that a fturf or Cruft may be begotten b^the heat and 
vigour of the Sun , which is afterwards raked up into 
to heapes and carried in wicker Baskets or Fenders to Brine 
Wells, where powring Sea-liquor to it, it carries away the 
faltilh humour, and leaves moit of the fand behind •, And if

any accompany the Liquor it afterwards fettles to the bot- 
tom. The yrinethus made is afterwards Boylcd into ^alr, and 
makes a gcod kind in LancaJJiire, but rcdciifh , that is ulcd 
for curing of Fidi, Flefh, c^c. 

The following account of the manner of doing it in Hants 
is more particular. • 

The Trenches arc made between every two Rods of Ground 
in breadth called Beds , whofe length may be fuch as is 
thought convenient. 

The Beds are made upon Sand, on which they bring Sea 
Mud mellowed by the Sun and the Froft, which they a'fo 
tall Sand, and endeavour to make as fine, as a GaRliner doth 
a Bed to few Onions upon*, this clone, they lave from their 
Ditches or Trenches fo much Sea li(|uor as the Beds will re- 
ceive for thoprefent Time , which in two days time in hot 
weather, wilibe exhaled, the frc(h from the lalt. 

Then the Earth appears in Clods , which they Harrow, 
and bring on a Drag, and a Rowie, m'kc fine, and 
repeat Sca-Iiquor, this twice or thrice prad^ilcd makes the 
Earth as ialt as isdefired^ with a fcurf of Salt upon it, which 
done, they remove it in Barrows to Store-Houfes to keep, 
and immediately fupply their Beds, and fo continue all 
vSummer. 

And when there is occafion to ufc it, they Lring it out 
in Barrows, and put it into Wicker-baskets like Beehives, 
that have Preynes at the bottom, to wHch putting Sea'- 
watcr over the VVell, it carries away the Salt into a Well, 
from whence in Pales it is removed to the boyling-Pan, and 
being well Boyled makes an excellent Salt for Flerti or Fifli 
free from all Dirt and Sand, but this way of making Salt is 
accounted Laboriouj, and confequently not much ufed. 

Any E^rth that may be made mellow and light, and will 
imbibe Liquor may be ufeful •, but that which hath a mixture 
of harfh fhuttlc Sand, or fuch as will make Morter, is im- 
proper for this purpofe. To fupply that which is proper , 
In Lamajlnre they ufe to pare tne Surface of a fiat of 
Sand that is overflowed by the Sea at fpring-Tidcs, two or 
three d ays bcfore.thofe Xidcs fall too low*

16 Of SaUufon Sa»df embody ed M the Sun, 

Ofjoho Salt. \ : ; 

AT Jerbo, a place in liarhary, 30 Leagues to tlie VVcft- 
warcl oF Tripo'y^ is much Saltmadc,on a plain of red Sand, 
by rhc Sun's Vigor : the Sea ( which here ebbs and flows but 
about a foot, ) making its way through the Sea landy-Banks 
into the Plain s fore fa id. A BaJJh feeing a Ship Arrive from 
Sea , and Anchoring on the Ihoalcs where is fafe Riding, 
cftimates her Bulk, nnd fells her Lading for about two Dollcrs 
a Tv.n, the which is carried on Eoard by Twr^f, or Moors 
into the bargain. 

This Salt is of fo ftrong a Grain, that it wi'l not readily 
Dlflblvc in frcfh water, wherefore if it be nccelTary the Mar- 
riners put fre(h water to it, to wafh out the Dirt and Sand, 
powringaway theLiquorthat will run. 

Of Salt upon Sandy Embodyed by the Sun. 

WHcre the Sin fhines hot, and the TiJes vary but lit- 
tle, 'tis eafie to have Salt enough, as they have in 
many places of the :itr eights. 

VVith Salt of the like kind made near Smyrna^ Beef at 
.Alidi'ummer hath been excellently well prcferved in manner 
following. 

, The Ox hath b:cn killed one day , and cut out into 
pieces and faked the next, the Salt hath been beat very 
fmall, and the Beef being very well rubbed therewith , it 
was footed or prefled into a Cask, with fprinklings of Salt 
between each Lay, in which condition it was permitted to 
ftand 4S hours, for dole packing made the Blood to arife 
above the Meat which was powred off , then a Brine was 
made of frclh-watcr, and Salt as ftrong as might be fufFicient 
to caufethe Salt to DiflToIve, (which it will not, if too little 
v/ater be put in, ) then the Meat wras waOicd in this Brine, 
and well faked again as before, and then the cask filled up 
with the Brine aforefaid. This was imparted by Mr.Richard 
JSforris^ an ancient experienced Maftcr or Mate, who now

Ohfervations thereon, 

,. '•.•;'■--■ ■ ' ■ ■ ' ■ . ■ '. 

1. \/\7E grant that Meat may be thus prefcrved from 

V V ftinking for a years time or more , but withalt 
affirm that luch Salt being cncombred with Bittern, fhall em- 
pair it in fizc gravey and goodnefs, from time to time till it 
be reduced to a rotten or mortified fubftance. 

2. The bloody Brine, if there had been an intention of 
faving Salt, might have been boyled and fcum'd, and after 
its fettleraent been powred off from its fediments, and ufed 
again to good purpole, being freed in part from an ill 
Quality. 

3. Meat in hot Countries, hath been cured with hot Salt 
and hot Brine, and that it fhould be lb , is the advice of 
Mr. Kichard Alcorm, the contrary being proper for cold 
Climates. 

4. He alfo thinks the letting of the Cask down into the 
Sea or Water, to be a good means to cool the Meat , and 
prevent all fermentation. 

Many Iflands in the Jltlamkl^and American-Oeean ^ yield 
abundance of Salt made of Sea water by the meer vigour or 
heat of the Sun , fuch are the Tortudos, but efpecially the 
Ifle of May ^ one of the l{[3inds o( Cape-Ferd^ where whole 
^\ctti of NewfoHHdUnd Men y and NewEtiglanders u(c yeSiYly 
to Lade: It lies in the North Latitude of about 15 degrees, 
is Peopled by PortH^Mezeif and their Negros^ and hath a Go- 
vernourj 'tisanlfland of an Oval form, about Eight Miles 
in Length, is ftored with Cattle, as ^ccfy Goats , Hogs , 
AflTes, c^c. 

The Salt there is thus made. In the Raines (or that Winter 
they have) the Wind veres about more Southwardly than at 
other times, and the Sea fwells higher, and makes itspaflage 
through the Banks, ( as at Jerbo ) into a (hallow Lake of a- 
bout ? Miles in Length, and in fome places about half a 
Mile in breadth^ yea and covers it large Plain of Sand ,

where in Sumtrer time when the Sea is fain lower, it Crufts 
or Kernes into large Salt, yea and cakes into Jarge pieces, 
where it is by the Inhabitants, or (if need be )by thofe that 
come to fetch it laid up in heaps, and afterwards conveyed 
by Afles or otherwife to the \A^atcr-fKle , and thence .Ship- 
ped : This is not done without paying fome fmall acknowledg- 
ment to the Governour for the pains of the Negroes^ who 
alfo make heaps when need requires, of that which the Lake 
yields; much tribute is not cxafted, in regard Salt enough 
may be had elfewhere for little or nothing, yea and in many 
places the Rocks afford great hard pieces or Logs of Salt 
made only by the Sun , particularly at Dartmouth in our 
Channel as one of his Majefties Cooks informes me, fuch are 
to be had. The Ifland affords no good Harbour againft 
Storms, yet Ships may ride near it in Water either {hallow 
or deep enough : At prefent we have a fair Correfpondence 
there, which was once interrupted, byreafonan EnglifhShip

I. of the Quality and Situation of the Ground 
for the mofl Convenience. ■ • ' . 

i.'T^He Grouud as to Matter, ought to be a Sea-Mud, 
i Oale or Sleech, Overflowed if it may be at i^k 
lowed Ipring-Tidc 3 foot, and whereas it is Obferved that 
the highcft Ipring-Tide, cfpecially if it be a ftorm from the 
Offing, may be 9 or 10 foot higher than the loweft fpring- 
Tide^ this renders Banking chargeable and hazardous, if not 
Land-lockt, or within a Creek or Arm of the Sea, where 
it is not annoyed with frcfhes. _, -. ^- ~ • 

Tiie reafon of fuch Overflowing is, that there may be 
made feeding Ponds, as they call them, with Walls of Earth, 
to keep Sea-Liquor in of any Dimenfions, two foot in height 
one above another , fo that the Loweft may be filled by a 
little Sluce in the Bank, at the loweft fpring Tide ; the reft at 
other higher or fpring-Tides , where this Liquor which is called 
Stay-Liquor will improve by the Sun and Wind, before it be 
tranfmitted into the (hallow Brine-Pans, which are fuppoled 
to be made on lower Ground, fo as to receive fupplies from 
thefe Ponds whcnfoever the fame is requifite, Theie Ponds 
are replenifhed with Fifli from the Sea, as Mullets, Place , 
Flounders, Eeles, &c. Where they increafe incredibly, and 
much exceed in goodnefs and largencfs, frefh River Floun- 
ders and Eeles*, and where there is convenience for fuch 
Ponds, there may be likewife for Oyfter-Pits. 

2. The Ground as to Quality muft be a ftrongSea-Mud, of 
a nature like Clay, that will retain Liquor without transfu- 
fion : And if the Ground be not fand , Gravel , Chalk , or 
Moor, 'tis probably fit for the purpofe , and more proper 
than Clay, (as being of aloofer Body,) whi^h is more difficult 
to be wrought, requiring three times the Labour , and is 
more apt to fplit or crack. ^ ^ -^ .; . , ' 

3. This Mud for conveniency, ought to be eight foot or ' 
more deep, for the making of Ponds expofed to the Weather, : 
called Cifterns , or common Receptacles to keep Brine in, 
without foaking away after it comes from thofe Pans called 
Sun-Pans, where it it is fuppofed to be made fufficiently

ftrong, and is transferred into thefe to grow more mature 
or mellow with Age: In th:fe Cifterns the Brine may be im- 
paired by Rain-water, in fuch Cafe that fwims uppermoft, 
and the Brine may be pumped from the bottom of the Pond, 
by fquare Pumps leaning on the fide of the Bank, the bot- 
tom of the Pump being faftned into a Basket. 

If one of thefe be covered over with a Tiled-Roof, it is 
called aBrine-Houfe, to retain ftorc for Winter Boyling ^ 
And a Tyled Roof is more convenient than Thatch, for when 
Repaired, the Strawcs will fall into, and difcolour the Liquor. 
The fides and ends of the Brine-Houfe, ought to be Polls of 
Timber, with Hurdles behind them; the Ground being fuch 
as will not imbibe the Liquor as aforefaid. 

If the Ground do not admit fuch Depth , thefe inconve^ 
niences cannot well be avoided ', Cifterns muil be made 
above Ground. ' - 

Into which the Brine muft be Pumped or Laved , with 
great Charge and Labour, which the Workmen in wet-Wca- 
thcr will decline, to the lofs of much Brine that might 
be faved. 

The Brine in the Tiled Brine-Houfes, freezeth not in Win- 
ter time, but in the uncovered Cifterns, the Rymc orFrefh 
at the Surface will freeze, which ought to be removed. 



2. As to the Situation. 



IT ought to be fuch , where fair Sun-fhiny- weather is moft: 
frequent, where the Wind may have free Accefs , near 
to a Coal -Mine, or a good Turf if poffible*. However not 
far from fuch Port, Creek, Harbour, or Mole, where Coals 
may be Landed, and Salt Exported. 

If convenient choice can be made, it may refcmble a great 
Pond, cr Lake rifing on each fide, with a Channel in the 
middle of it, which being Banked athwart, will leffen the 
height of Banking, and confequcntly the Charge, and if it be 
in a Salt- water. River Land-Lockt, the Bank is more fecure 
from dangerous Breaches^ that may be made in it by the 
Sea., ' " ' ■ ■ '. _ '{■: ._ _.■' ' .\ ^' ' ' '' '

Near the Channel in the middle may be made a Key , 
whereon to Land or unload Goods, from VefTels that come 
up/ or go down the Channel, athwart which in the decpcft 
part may be made a Sluce , with ftrong Gates or Portals 
like Shop-windows, with Hinges that fhall open Sea-wards to 
carry off Frefhcs or Floods, and when the Sea comes in (hall

conceived to be a proper Place, and the like fome fuggeft 
concerning Falmouth. 

PofTibly another more Northward might be defirable and 
that might be at Jarrowf Slyke, a little within the Mouth

of the ufefulnefs of Salt, in rmiiing Land fertile, 

TO which we fhall annex divers inftances of the like kind 
taken ''rom Mr. Hartlibs Legacy , Sir f^a^h Platts Jewel 
Hiufe of Art a, :d Nature ^ which he fays page 128, were 
found out by meer chance, and not by Induftry. 

1. The firft was of a filly Swain, who paflTing over an Arm 
of the Sea with his Seed Corn in a Sack, by mifchance at his 
Landing fell into the Water, and fo his Corn being left there 
till next Low-water, became fomewhat Brackilh, yet fuch 
was the NecelTity of the Man, as that he ( notwithftanding 
that he was out of all hope to have any good liiccefs there- 
by, yet not being able to buy any other, ) bellowed the 
lame Wheat upon his Plowed Grounds , by the advice of 
a worthy Gentleman who imparted the fame. Iii fine when^ 
Harveft-time came, he reaped a Crop of goodly Wheat ^ 
fuch as in that year not any of his Neighbours had the like,, 
yet the Experiment hath not been further profecuted. 

2. A Perlbn of his own Inclination , fowed a Bufliel of 
Salt long fince at Capham , upon a fmall patch of Barren^ 
Ground, which to this day remains more frefh, green and 
full of fwarth, than all the reft of the Fields about it, but 
this he did not profecute further, in regard a Buihel of Salt 
Gofts more than two Loads of Dung. ' ' - '■ - - - ' . 

g. It is the daily and ufual pra^ice in the Weftern parts 
of EngUnd^ for the people to carry their faltifh Sands into 
their Barren Grounds, whereof fbmc of them do lie five Miles 
diftant from the Sea, and find the fame exceeding profitable, 
for that thereby their Inheritance is enriched for many years 
together. 

More particularly, Mr. Carew in his Survey of Cornwall y 
relateth that they ulc a fat Sea-Sand, which they carry up- 
many Miles in Sacks, by which they have very much im- 
proved their Barren-Lands.

1 4 Of the u[efnlmjs of Salt in reftdring Land fruitful, 

S- At Namptwich, upon the fall of any great ftore of 
Land Waters into their Pits they are forced to empty and 
draw out all the frefh- Water, which always floates upon 
the Brine, and to bellow the fame in I'uch places as are ncareft, 
and therewith alfj emptying fome of the Brine with the 
frefh- Water, they find in time this Earth fo ftrongly fea- 
foncd with thefc brackifti-Waters, that no Soilc or Dung is 
comparable unto it, for the manuring ot their Ground. 

6. In the SaltMarfhcs ofthelfles of X^moi^riy there arc 
little Hillocks on which is mowed as good Grafs as in many 
other places : And thofe Hillocks do come up of the Grounds 
and Wafhings, thrown up from the bottom of the faid 
JMarfhes, which are as Brackifh as the Sea-water ; and yet 
neverthelefs faith Sir fJ. Tlatt, page 104. 1 did never fee 
any fairer Corn in my Life than groweth in them. 

7. The Vines of the Country of Xaintoign , which arc 
planted in the midft of the Salt Marfhes, do bring forth a 
kind of black Rayfin, which they call Canchets , and where- 
of there is a Wine made that is nothing infcriour to our 
Hypocras, in which they ufe alfo to dip their toafted Bread • 
and their Vines are fo fertile, that one Plant of them doth 
bring forth more Fruit, than fix of thofe that grow about Paris 
fo that 'tis evident, that Salt doth help the Goodnefs Sweet- 
nefs. Maturity, Generation, and prcfervation of the faid 
Vines ^ alfo the Air it felf is benefited thereby, albeit here 
is no defign to prove that common Salt agrees with all kind 
of Plants, yet all manner of Fruits Planted in the Salt-Marflies 
of Xantoi^r/y and all wild Herbs, Thornes, and Thiftlcs prof- 
per fo exceed ingly there that no where better. ft

ed with it fome flacked Lime to dry it, and make the Grain 
( which thus refembles fmall Comfits ) feparate from one a- 
nother in Sowing, and fo carry it into the Field and Sowr

will not Eat it, as they ufaalfy do other Seed *, Smutty grain

will Mifcarry, whereas another that is nor, is remedied.

I. Brackilh Waters arc unfit to make Drink for Man's 
Body. . , . ,,, ;, 

Anlwer, Nothing is more unfavoury in our Drink than 
Salt, bccaule that our third doth naturally dcfirc to be fn- 
tisfied with that which is cold and moift, whereas Salt on the 
contrary is hot and dry, but hence it doth not follow that 
Springs which be Ibmcwhat brackiHi, are inripropcr to water 
the Grounds. 

1. To Man and divers other Land-Creatures, the eating 
of much .Salt is very contagious, becaufe itmakeththc Blood 
Salt, and brccdcth Barrcnncls in Man's Body, by the exceed- 
ing drynefs thereof, and makcth our Seed or Nature too 
(harp. 

Anfwcr, Salt moderately ufed is ftirring in our Bodies, it 
whitens, hardens, and favours all things, ay Beef and barrcl'd 
Cod, &c. Which cauicth Vegetation, and gives good nourifli- 
mcnt. 

3. In Holy Writ we read JW^^J the 9. 45. That Jbime,' 
Uch when he took^the City of the Shechemites, beat it downand 
Sewed it with Salt,

Whence it may be urged,' that Saltnefs is a principal means 
to make the Ground unfruitful , and the fowing of Salt 
thereon, bringeth forth Barrennefs, ?nda Curfe upon it. 

Hence fomc humane Laws of our ancient Fore Fathers fcem 
derived :. Namely, That all fuch Ground as becafr.e forfeit 
and Confifcate to the Crown, by reafon of a high and Ca- 
pital offence committed, fliould be Plowed and Sowed with 
Salt. 

Anfwer, 'Tis granted, that talayon tlOo much Salt, through 
its corroflveneis it doth burn dry, and renders the Grou-nd 
Barren and unfruitful. ; •- -" ' ■ ^•i'^^'-^^- • ' * '/'■^'^'■''- •

Water-Pan, 2 the Second-Pan, and S the 
Sun-Pan, and fo in the fame piece of Ground 
may be made as many Ranks as the Dimen-

Each of thefe may be two Rodi or Poles fquare , 
Ridges of Sea-Clay between each, for a Man to walkupon. 

Thefe Pans muft be fmooth and Level, to be floated

Boards tyed to their Feet called Gib- Boardi, who with Iron

Ground, which is moiftned with Water.

of it rnay be derived inro the v'ccond Panj and after it hath 
likewife been cxpofcd iherc, one Inch of it or fefs is to be 
derived into the Sun-Pan. 

The transferring of Water or Brine from one Pan to a- 
nother, is performed by a Man with a litJe Paddle as br.oad 
as the Pilin of a Mans hanc!, with which he turns out a Clod 
that opens a paffigc for water, from each Pan to the other, 
and when the Liquor is run, puts it in again , with cemen- 
ted Mud. 

A skilful Brineman will govern and d\te(\ 3 or 4 La- 
bourers, he may himfclf Earn 8 r. a Week, aiid inHarveft 
weather more : One skilful pcrfon, can mannage and look 
after 60 rank of Fans.. 

On the out fide of the Sun- Pans, is a little Channel made 
to convey the Brine {:^ common from them all) to a large Pan, 
any where conveniently Seated, called the Common Sun-Pan, 
which may be fo deep as to be filled 7 or 8 Inches with 
Brine, where ir may remain mellowing from 6 to 24 hours, 
or till the Liquor bears a Hens- Egg ne a/ laid, till it floats 
above water the height or Ireadth of a Threepence or a 
Groat, or till it be fo ftrong, that the Egg lies along in it 
half above waer. 

Here ic may not be improper to Intimate, that the ingc- 
nous Mr. tkhard Walker, chief Gauger of the Excifc Office, 
befidcs his other Qualifications, hath great skill in Glaffcs, 
and Giafs- Working, and hath invented a Glafs, with a liquor 
in it hcrmeticaIlySe..lcd, wh ch doth by its depth in fwim- 
ming in Wort-Liquors, and W,ne, determin the Arcngth 
thereof, which doubtlefs might be properly applycd to 
Brines. 

The Brine in thefc Pans being found of a fufficient ftrcngtb, 
is from thence derived by Channels or Brine-Currents to thofe 
Pone's called Cifterns, where the Rain and the Sun breed 
red Worms, that cleanfe and purify the Liquor j where it 
ripens or mellows by Age, and grows the more fit for Boy- 
ling i Old Brine far exceeding that which is New.- Between 
the Ciilern and the Tiled Brine Store Houfe, there ought 
to be Pipes under Ground, to convey the Brine from the 
former into the latter j In which pipes there arc Stop-CocKf,

of either, as (hall be thought fit , i. to be pumped up by 
Windmill-Pumps that have Crankcs like the handles or Wim- 
bles , and conveyed by the latter Pipes to Wooden Clearers, 
( like Brewers fats or Coolers, ) at the Boyling-Houfes. 

In Mr." jikornes work near Portfwomh , is a notable 
Windmill-Pump , that raifeth the Brine about 24. foot 
high, to wit, Pipes go away from the bottom tbcrco, which 
is not above half a foot under ground , m a declivity, or 
leaning on one fide to the Fipe in common between the 
Ciftcr.i and the Hrine-Store Hjufe, and fo the ( ump doth 
from either raifc it about 12 or 14 fo©t on one fidj , an 1 
forceth it 10 or 12 foot higher in the former Pipes, conti- 
nued on the other fide to the Clearer at the Boy ling Houfj .• 
The foot of the Windmill Pump, relHng in and m jving round 
in thefc Pipes, with two Clrppers on each fide, to keep ail 
Liquor drawn up from running back, that when t'.c one is 
open, the other is (hut, v. .. . 

And here perchance it may not be improper to mention, 
that .'ir Samuel Morelatidy haih lately invented an Engin, 
that forceth Water in a continual S ream , without Sta:ts, 
much higher than the Banquettmg Houfe at IVlvrehall, and 
the like at Windfor^ above the Caiile, to his Majcfties great 
-fatisfaaion, and hi^ own great Renown. 
'" The querie may be, whether the fame be not Applicable, 
.to ihc conveying of Brine from on : place to another ? 
/ The Brine raifej b/ the Sjn .is aforefaid , proves better 
,than any natural Brine of Pits hitherto known, moft ofthofe

5. of Salterns or (Boyling- Houfes ^ Grates^ 
Furnaces , and Iron ^oyl'mgJPans , with 
the Art of 'Boyling of !Brinc. 

ABoyling-Houfe is called a Saltern , and ought to be 
Built near to the place from whence the Brine is to be 
lupplied, of a fixc fuitable to the number of Iron- Pans, that 
can be there employed. 

Thefe Houfes are but one Story-high, of Stone or Brick, 
and fo thatcht up to the Top , ( like Barns, ) but muft be 
left a foot open in the Ridge, for the fleam of the Boyling- 
Liquor to pafs through. i 

Each Boyling-Pan will require a Furnace, and a Grate un- 
der it, but yet one Brick- Chimney pafling through the Thatch, 
will ferve to Convey away the Smoak of the Furnaces of 
two Fans. 

, The Fireplace under the Boylers, or Boyling-Pans, isbui!t 
^vith Brick, fquare , Hoping on each fide like a Ridge or 
Millers Tunnel, at fuch a height that a Grate may be plac'C 
3 foot above the Ground, and the Boyler two foot and three 
quarters above the Grate. 

The Hoping abovefaid is to be fuch, that the Grate may 
be three foot and a half long, and three foot broad. "' ' "• 

This Grate is to be made of wrought Iron, the Bars in 
length according to the Dimenfions above, in thicknefs and 
in breadth alike, to wit an Inch and a quarter, each of them 

to 



iij«#«*« .' — 



to (land afundcr near half an Inch, wRd to have two or three 
Bars athwart under them, to fupport them ail. 

The Ground under them is to be the Receptacle for the 
Afhes and fmall Cinders that fall from the Grate, and is to 
be Arched up like the Mouth of an Oven, that the Fire on 
the Grates may draw the more vent. 

The Grate is to have an Iron Door, at which it is fup- 
plyed with Coals, and on each fide another little Iron-Door, 
called a vent hole , which Doors arc to be opened or kept 
(hut at pleafure-

This feet of Iron is made in Sujfexy Hants , &c. Of it 
are likewife made Iron Guns, and Backs of Chimneys, and 
it is much cheaper, and fitter for this ufe than wrought Iron, 
in regard it will ferve at any time to make Bar-Iron , and 
is not devoured by ruft, as wrought Pans are, being as good 
as Sow-mctall. 

Some Pans arc cail in four pieces, which muft be ri vetted 
together with Bar-Iron, and the Holes and Cracks flopt up 
with Putty, and the like is to be done when a Call- Fan

5« of Portfei ani Lemmlngton Salt, 

The quantity that may come off from a Pan, m^y be four 
or five gatlons, but in boyling u,> or refining of French Bay 
Salt, the din and fcum i» exccedi g much. 

The next rhjng to be done is to fcpararc the Sand , All 
Brines whctber of Pits oi* made of Sea Liquor , or by melt- 
ing of l-orreign Sales, in Boyling petrify and yield a Sand, 
winch cannot be conceiv'd to be in thf: L-quor before boy- 
ling; For a ftrong Brine hath been dreyn'd or fqucez'd 
through moft pure Holland of eight foldings, andnofymptom 
of any Sond was Icfit remaining. 

The Pan boyling violently in the midjle> this Sand is cad 
outwards towards the Corners, where in Ci^r/J^ir^ , and Wor. 
ceflerjhirc^ they p'ace fmall Iron Pans to receive the fame ; 
But it being tound by experience , that this Sand will fall 
tQ the bottom of the Pan before the Salt precipitates , it i^^ 
Vv'ith a Boaid-Rakc, Raked to one corner of the Fan , and 
then taken out with Ladles an] put into Wooden Vefle!s 
callcJ Pots, like Wheel- barrows, open at one end, which arc 
placed upon Stand* or Beams under the Clearers. This Sand 
is puie white, and rcfembles a inaiTy Snow-ball , and being 
dug and ftirr'd, there wilt run away Brinefrom it, to ber-c- 
fcrvcd in a receptacle underneath, for further boyling. 

This Sand will naturally cake to the bottom of the Pans, 
and is admitted (b to do every boyling , till the fame be 
fmooth and fit for the Rake. 

And much of it that wiU Aick to the fides is forced oi? 
with a driving cutting Hammer, once at leafl in three weeks, 
and is made ufc of for Clods, and Ridges between the QiaU 
low Brine Pans. 

A Pan may yield two or three Gallons of this Sand, if 
the Brine be new and foul, which being removed, to make 
the Salt, hitherto fwimming and floating in the Liquor , 
precipitate or fall to the bottom, fhut the two Vent-holes> 
near the mouth of the Grate and the Door thereof, and then 
the fmc k for want of Vent ftiflcs and put*- out the Fire ^ 
And after 12 hours time the Salt will be fain to the bottom 
and become hard, and there wrll remain a Liquor at the top, 
which being l^yled away or continuilly Evaporated rendeis 
more Salt. : ,»

'Tis ufual to keep Boyling all the Week Days and Nights* 
from Monday Morn ng to Saturday Noon, and then put out 
or ftiflc the Fires as aforefaid, till Monday, and proceed as 
before. 

Were there no other Method, this were in efFe^ to lofc 
much time and give over Working. To prevent which, in 
Chefliirej &c. to make the Salt precipitate and fall to the 
bottom, they ufc Eggs , Blood, Ale, but after much experi- 
ence the Remedy following was found our, not enly to make 
the Sit fink, but likewife to harden the fame. ; -• 
.: Take Oxe ( or Stags ) Tallow well refin'd, and melt it, 
and put it into Lees of Wine, the like quaniiiy in \12ight 
or meafurc of each ; And this is a good proportion for old 
Liquor, But if New, there muft be lefs of the Lees and 
more of the Tallow. 

After the Skimming and taking out the Sand , And that 
the Fire hath been ftopt till the Liquor becomes quieted, 
then ufc the faid Compolition of Oxe- Tallow and Lees: To 
wit, take the quantity of a Nutmeg of it at the end of a 
Lath, and turn it round about oi the furfacc of the Liquor, 
till it be fpent, Then after 2 hours at moft, open the Vent 
holes or Doors, quicken the Fire , and Evaporate or boylc 
away the Liquor, and you wil! have the Salt lying as it were 
in a puddle ai the bottom, made and fit to be removed. 
Now to fave the Pans from cracking or burning, they throw 
en frelh Coals and (hut the Coor and Vent holes of the 
Fire place, and the Fire is again ftopt. Then the ^ alt is to 
be raked up to one fide, taken out and put into dreyning 
Cribs, which arc made like Hay Rack', with Icofe Ribs on 
each fide to take out, thst ftand fo near to one another , 
that there is but room to put in a Mill d Crown or half 
Crown, where after it hath lain dreyning in tbe Boyling- 
Houfe the fpace of 6 or 8 hours, it is a pure hard kerned 
vValt, and may be removed, but yet will continue dripping 
three Weeks or more, and in the event with Age, (unlefs 
often moved ) wil! become Rocky. 

The Liquor in the Pan which is placed a little inclining 
towards one comer is called Bittern, v;h:ch ( all but a little 
to keep the Pan from burning, ) is taken out and dreyned 
away with the Salt, aod the Pan iismcdiately Elled with a

In 8 hours time a Pan of Brine of a moderate or fitting 
ftrcngih w.ll be compleatly made into S-Jt, with the ex*

Night, And their Wages is about 11 (hillings a Week, the • 
fifth attends only in the day time , and his Wages may be

The Liquor that Dreynes from the Salt in the Cribs, is a 
flrong fort of Bittern, which is received on a Board under-

And by Article 33. Packers, Coopcis, "Wharfmen, are 
prohibited to pack any courfe falted Herrings, either full Oi

From the premifcs it may be well inferred, That an Affay 
of J^alt to be EftabliQied by Law, is in many refpcrts mo.c 
nced.uJ iii£«^/^«^. ; . 

1. Becaufe it is to run too great a hazard of Mens Lives 
or Wcllfare, to fa't the Provilions of a Ship or Garrifon 
either with a bad Salt, or I'gnorantly. And the like may be 
faid of a FiOiery Entcrprize. whereof moft hitherto under- 
taken have mifcarried through the badnefs of the Salt ufed. 

2. BecAufe there arc more forts cf For reign Salt Impor- 
ted \x\^ England than into Holland, And why (hould not 
the like care be ufeJ here as there. 

3i Becaufe there arr feme forts of weak waterifh Salts 
made bad in Englandy to fave Charges, when they might be 
made dry :'nd good. > 

4. Becaufe the Virtues and ufe of the beft fort« of Salt are 
known but to few, confequcmly little defired ; And untill 
they are, the people are liable to abufe. And fuch an AfTay 
might be a means 10 make them more known , at home 
and abroad. 

5v, Becaufe for not knowing and ufing of a good Salt to 
cure Herrings on board at v^-ea, the Fiflieimen have been 
forced to fell them to their Hofts on (hore by Gontradl to 
fiilt, at. fo low a' rate, that they could not live on it. Hence 
the Coaft To vns became much; dcnpopulated and impove- 
rished f hence much weak or ill falted Cod hath been dried

And in cafe of a plentiful Fishing, ihc Fi(hcrs arc forced to

and thereby lofe ttic teft of the Seafon of Fiftiifg, or ihrciw 
what they have taken overboard, that they may return to

will not Buy them, and no body elfe may.

ted from Scotland, &c. under pretence of being made or re- 
fined in fomc place of £w^/^«^ » And fo the King lofe his 
Cuftomcs. * 

7. Becaufe Ship-Mafters lie under a great Temptation to 
embafe, a^dconfequcntlyembezil and get corrupt Gain, the 
rather in regard the Laws that enjoyn the regulating of Mca- 
fures, arc oiot obfcrved in feveral Corporations and Mari- 
time Towns, but illegal Meafures maintained , and irregular 
ways of meafuring pradtifed. 

o. Though its believed we need not have much bad »^alt 
in England^ yet without fuch courfe it will always abound: 
Moreover the keeping of Salt in Stoves or Hot-Houfcs, is to 
prevent its loOng weight and bulk, whereas by the weight 
of Salt a good eftimate may be made of its worth. 

Upon experience, a WmcheSler Bu(het of Port fea Salt weigh-

And of NewcaftU Salt , by the Lord Breretons experience

Argumtnti for Bifcour Aging French SaU^ &c, 6^ 



Other Arguments for Vifcouraging . he Expence 
of (Bay and Foyeign Salts^ by imfofing a 
hivj? Duty thereon. 

1. QUch Salts bein^ granulated only by the Sun , abound 
i3 with three ill Qualities, Dirt, >and, Bittern, ofwtach 
fee page 55. 

2. Bay Salt was formerly Imported in French Bottoms, 
m regard the French King laid an Impoft upon all Salt made 
in Brittany^ and Farmed it out to luch as were rcftr;iined to 
Import it in their own VelTels, who paid but 3 ^. a Wey 
advance here, whereas EngUfh Veffels paid 50 fou'x a Ton 
there, by which means the Employment of our Shipping was 
prevented, and much Bay Salt (albeit prohibited) is frequent- 
ly Innportcd under the Notion of Gnernfey Salt, vhj^re there 
is but little made ^ under Colour whereof much rich G.oods 
and Liquors are fmugled in, snd Wool, Fu lers-Eai th, and 
Tobacco pipe Clay Exported, contrary to Law. 

3. It is a great Impoverilhmcnt to the Nation tofpendas 
we do^ by a rational Computation to the value of 60 thou- 
fand pounds pr annnm in Foreign Salt, which is either paid 
for in Money, or Returns to that value prevented \ whereas 
we can be furni(hed with twice as much of our own as we 
can fpend, in regard feme of our Brine-fprings are inexhau- 
ilible, and run to waft, and Salt making in many places is given 
over for 4 or 5 Months time each year, where it comes to pafs 
that, multitudes of poor want Employment, become a Eurthen 
to the PariOics, or inftead of being Confumptioners at home, 
are driven to Foreign Plantations to fearch for a Livcly- 
hood abroad. 

4. Bay-Salt is improper to cure either Herrings or Cod, 
in heap or in pile on Board, becaufe much cfpecially of the 
largcn: of it, though mingled with other fmall Salts, doth not 
di{K>lve foon enough to pinch and fave within time ^ Hence 
the Dutch prohibited the ufe of it ibout Herrings. And wc

64 Arguments for D'tfcourAgingV^QTichSalt J &c, 

1 . Becaufc it will be a means to incrcafc Fifhcrmen, Sea- 
men, and Pilots: For if by teafon of a good Salt, which 
pincheth, pcirceth, and faves quick , Fifli be well cured on 
Board, the induftrious Labourers will reap near double the 
profit , and need not be compelled to fell their Filh to be 
cured , to them that have aflumcd a power to fct a price , 
which hath been fo general a Difcouragement that not one 
third of the Number go now from Tarmonth , the Cinque^ 
Torts, and Members y as were wont tc do. Hence our Mt- 
ritime Towns are much depopulated, and both them and the 
neighbouring Countries impovcriihcd for want of the Confump- 
tion, Trade, and Returns by them occafioned. 

2. Becaufe Filh cured with a good refined Salt, isnotonfy 
more acceptable to the Market at Home, but to all Mar- 
kets abroad, and is fold at near double the price our Fi^ 
cured with Frfwcfe Salt is fold at. ^ ^^ 

3 . Divers of the Fifhmongeis G)mpany, met together a.

to JceUnd tO catch Cod , which they Salt with frwch 
and other jU Sahis , .whence it proves Dirty and many 
times bad , doth not fell in any Forrcign Market ex- 
cept in France, or if it doth, with an ill Repute, as if Eng- 
land could furnifh no becter, and at a price cheaper by 20 
fer Centum than Fifh cured with a proper Salt, and barrelled 
up as the Dutch do .- Fkr.ce it becomes over plentiful at home, 
and being miftaken for that v. hich is well cured by the Roy- 
al Filhcry Company, begets an iil Eftecm here alfo, on a Com- 
modity that deferves high Applaufe. Whereas if good Salt 
were ufed whether in File or Barrelling , they conceived 
the Filhcry Trade of Tarmouth would quickly be much En- 
larged, not only for Expence on (hore, but for Viftualling of 
Ships, for which Iceland Cod well cured is very cheap and 
proper.

^8 • • Of Red-Herri^gf, 

\ 5. Day »^alt is improper to cure Flcfli withall^ becaufc in 
liine it renders the Meat dry, hard, dirty, rotten , and by 
reaibn of the Bittern in it, confumes the goodnefs or nutri- 
tnental part of the Meat, as moifture, gravy, 6ic. 

And this comes to pafs not only from the ill quality, but 
alfo from the overlarge (izc of this Salt, fo that about one 
third of it diflolves not in proper time, but continues fo long 
a diffolving, until ail with it, is almoft as Salt as Salt it fcif j 
Hence exceHive quantities of it nluft be ufed , whence great 
remains of it are waiied and found, at the bottom of the Cask, 
which is not fit to be ufed again, yet in the Pilchard Filhery 
is thrown by fok f$CO\)d and third ufes, but being once wet 
with the blood of t4|,e FiOi is contir.alIy wailiiig, near as 
much as if in ufc. Whence one Budiel of good Salt of 
a regular file , though one half dearer than Fretjch , will 
turn to a cheaper account. \.-.v..;i 

6. The Dfttch Mariners returning from long Voyages, look 
fat, healthful, and fre(h Coloured, becaufe their Fle(h and Fifli 
is faved with refined Salt. Whereas on the contrary our Ma-

the Barbadoes and liked them fo well, that he was pleafcd 
to give an account how well they proved, and to direct his 
Secretary to put him in mind to write to his Majcfty to give 
cncourygement to this kind of Salt; part of the Herrings were 
carried to Jamaica, where after 6 orfcven Months they were 
fpcnt by his Lordfhips Servants, and were as good as any what-

at Michelmas 1680, that were caught by the Royal FiQicry

her Mafter did not regard them, gave them r, vay to~poor 
People, having no precept to the contrary.

by they beconic Confumptioners of our Native Commodities, 
and be enabled to pay Taxes towards a neceiTary War if fuch 
fliould happen. 

Whereas, as the Cafe (lands, thoufands have quite given

fuch means are forced away to the Plantations , live on the

3. It will Employ many Carpenters, Smiths, Brick-makers, 
Brick- layers, to Build and repair Houfes and Furnaces, and 
to make Carts, Barrows^ anj Cribs to remove away and 
(lore up Salt in. 

4. It wiU Employ much Shipping and Mariners to fetch 
Coals, and to tranfport Salt, and confequently increafe our 
ilrength in Mariners and Shipping. 

5. It will Enrich the Nation, by preventing the needlefs 
carrying out of Money, to pay for French Bay Salt , and 
other Salts, which formerly in time of War in the years^ 
from 1627, to 1630 V was fold here from Eight to Ten (hil-

dity will be always at a moderate price. And albeit it (hould 
be dearer than Foreign, yet as afbrcfaid a much lefs quanti-

And both then and (ince many Ships went yearly in their 
Ballaft to fetch Bay Salt, but of late fince we obtained a good

they were v^'iihin a League and ahalfofit, found the Ground 
all covered with Aflies and Pumiceftones , over which they 
were forced to March towards the bottom of the Moun ain, 
the Sky being Serene , and no flames to be fecn, they took 
a rcfolution to go up it, but the Guides infomed that if 
they paflcd any further, they would run great hazard of fink* 
ing into the holes the Fire had made, fiom whence there 
would be no likely hood of recovery. - - ^ s ^ 

However he and his Companion Marched over the Afhea 
and Pumices, ( mid Leg deep ) towards the Top , where 
they faw a great number of Birds flying up and down as 
black as Pitch , and they were Ravens and rnltnres which 
build there* 

Being got about half a I^eague up the Hill, they found it 
begin to tremble under their Feet, and heard a ft range Crafh- 
ing and Rumbling within, which argued a Hollowneft, and 
gave them no little fear of finking into it : At the fame time 
round about them they perceived great Chinks^ out of which 
Flames and Sparks came forth , which were noyfome and 
ftunii like burn'd Brimftone, which frightned them fo much, 
thiat they got back as faft as they, could , for fear of being 
Swallowed. 

Being got about thirty paces back, a Cloud of AO.es broke 
fuddainly out of the Mountain> ( fo big and thick it oblcurcd >

not fee one another : but that which frighted them themoft, 
was to fee every moment new gufts of Fire and Aflies break

When they Broile them they Butter them , and indeed 
Iceland affords incredible plenty of Butter , as is mentioned

X>!ainly fcen, and were fo greedy that they took i6oo in a

and cured them, the manner whereof here and dfe where i$; 

The Cod being haled on Board, they arc l.id upon th« 
Decks in the Vcffcl, (ox may be on b ards or Tables 5 ) One 
Man chops or wrings off the Head throwing it over- Board, 
and enters a Knife at the Navel, rnd cuts it up to the Throat

Rows, to throw away j as a!fg the Livers to rcfcrvc in bar- 
rels to make Oyleof. - 

Another, the Sp!ittcr, takessoutthe back bone, and liys 
the F*(li open to the Tail. 

Then they fait them , and lay them Nape and Tail in a 
Bed on the Deck, as faft as they can difpatch. 

The manner of falting is, a iMan h.th a fmall falting 
Platter that may hold about a quart, which he difpcrfeth 
chcifly on the middle or thickeft part of ihc Fifti, from whcnc-c 
it runs ofFon the Tail ardthinncfl parr. > 

And when one lay is done, they pile them up in their 
Ho'ds, and proceed to another, making in the middle of the 
Hold, the c ujfe of Fifh higher by two foot than on the fides 
that the Pickle dcfcending may fall on the fides.

foundland, and being Laden with Fifh^ the moft of them ^tailed 
from thence for feveral Ports of Spain, and itt Territories ;

€adiz attd St, Lucar, 20 for Malaga and Vekx, ftom 20 
to^ofer Alicant, Valencia, ^/M^Caitagena.* Befides others that 
went te the Groyn and other Port Towns in Spain ; the mofi 
of the remainder went for Maiorcai and MinorctL, Sicilia, Sar- 
dinia, Naples, and fpent in the Dak§dem of Milan , and in 
friliMalirigof their G^WioonSf CalUeSyMc Hereby^ (weUcanp- 
dtred^) m had great advantages , for that clearly there wot 
added to the Stocky of the Nation, at leaft five hundred thm- 
fahd pounds per Annum, and fo mttch got oat of the Sea, by 
the Labonr and Jndnfiry of our People^ and the Shipping mairp- 
tained. And it wot alfo a Nurfery for Seamen, breeding more 
than all other Trades whatfotver ; they carry not out fo much 
Beef and "Bread as they feonld have Eaten in England ; the 
mofi of their Pood being Pi fit : ^fid if they had not been thm 
Employed, perchanre they might have lived idly at Howte, and 
f§ have been unprofitable Members of the Common Wealth, and 
to hiTve had their Sttbftfiances from other Jadafiriom Perfons. 

Whilft we have aftfted the French, they have in a manner 
got this whole Trade ; this year they had above 2 $0 Ships at 
Newfoundland, and have obtained free permijfion from the King 
of Spain, to enter into the Ports of Bilboa, St» Scbafliians, and 
Pafaquc, with their Fiji) and Men, where they do not only far- 
mjh the Men of War that takg ns , but the Fifij is c^^ried from 
three to four hundred Miles up in the Countries of Spain. 

St. John de Luz, had not formerly aboMe 8 Sail of Ships ^ 
and this year they have had near fifty S ail , a good part of which 
were L'nglilh Prizes, and without doubt incovertly the SpaniardSv 
have a great interefl in them, and it will be a hard matter now 
to get thid Trade again from the Vrcnc\i» 
- ' Thus they, and the French are faid to be more numerous, 
and Induftrious in that Trade than heretofore , whereas the 
Englijh much decline, the oaufes whereof arc y

Fifli in our HarbouiS, namely the Frtnch pai4 5 per Cemtfm, 
which made them to retire to. the Southfide of the end of the

obferving this, took the opportunity in the obfence of our

on the fame three or four times over, to haftcn thcdiflblving 
of the Salt, by which means there will be much time and 
Salt favcd. 

3. When II becomes Bloody and Scaly, it may be Boyled 
and fcumm'd, and fo refitted for further ufe. 

4 When ihe Fifh are waflied and dreyned, they are fit 
(0 be FrciTed as before, and will not have that fiery taft 
which the Bittern occaficns in the former method , and the 
wafliing, in regard the Fifli are not Dirty, need not be per- 
fermed in the Sea but in a Storchoufe, where one Hogfliead 
of Water or Sea Liquor will wafli many Lafts, and may by 
often ufe, be made fo ftrong bythe J;alt hanging on the Fi(h, 
that being laved on the Pile, will not only fupp'y the ufe of

Salt in whicli th. y lay foaking.

I. ^TpHofe that are caught at the firfl: arrival , may befaltcd 
± as white Herrings , and kept a year more or Icfs, 
and will be more acceptable than fuih Herrings , by reafon 
they are more fatandOyly; furthermore they may be ufed

denominated in an\Ad oi Parliaments 14. Car, 2. Cap. 28. 
out of a barrel of thi^ kind which had its Pickle, I bad fomc 
given me, which were dreflcd at a Tavern raw like Ancho- 
vies, and est very like them to the great content of the Par- 
takers ; whereas a barrel of them fent to a Merchant that had 
loft their Pickle, proved rwfty and naught. 

2. They may be cured with a Pickle, and barreld up like 
White- Herrings ; For the reafon why in the common Method 
they prefs out the Oyle, is becaufe they know not how to 
cure them in the Pickle, which may be done by Repacking 
them with dry rcBned Salt, and the Cask afterwards fed 
with good Pic)u« at 6 or 8 hours diilance. 

•3. Afterthcfirftora little falting, they may be Decfcd and 
rendred like Red Herrings. 

4. In this Method not fo much Oyle is drawn out of 
the FiHi, and yet more may be faved than in the former 
Method. 

5. Refined Salt is not of a fiery, dry, burning, corro- 
ding, mortifying Quality , rendring an ill taft, but quickly 
pincheth and peirceth and keeps the FiHi cool and moift in 
a hot Climate, whereby fermentation is prevented.

then fils them up, and heads up the Barrels. 

The Pickle muft be fo ftrong that a Herring m;^y fwim in

Herring, that it makes it ftiff, and preferves it; otherwileif 
the Pickle be weaker than the nature of the Herring, it will 
overcome the ftrength of the Pi.kle, and fo the Herring will 
decay. 

One barrel of Salt will cure three barrels of Herrings, and 
it is common to allow 2 barrel, of Salt in a Lad, of i4ba rels 
to War withall, that is to rowle the Herrings in the S.dt 
before they are Packt. 

To the Dutch Laws before mentioned, wemayaddcnother

of North and South Wales, is aflerted by Capt. Lleyd before

three Lafts of Herrings, and if their Biats would contain one 
hundred Laft?, they might fill them. Upon thefc Coafts there 
are from 60 to 80 of thefe Boats, ard though they catch a 
great quantity of Herrings, yet ignorance, want of Method

I, ^T^He Dz/rrfc cut off. the Head, Taile, the bottom of thcr 
X Eelly, take the Rows out, and the Skins off, and. 
then cut them into pciccs, and commonly eat them wth Oyle. 

But here we mince them fmal!, and befidcs the Oyle, put 
in minced Onions, Lemraon, Apples. 

At the Houfe of Si^w/or Hominico ^^Jtullan, at the Sugar- 
Loaf againft the South end of Jackanapes- Lane^ they arelold 
ready and excellently prepared without Bones in Gally-pots. 
with Oyle, which upon experience may be thus done, for 
keeping very well for a Week or longer. 

1. The Bones being taken out, chop them very fmall with 
feme Lemmon«Pcelc. 

2. Take ferae Onyons and pared Apples, cut them fmall, 
and Boyl them together till they be foft. 

3. When they arc cool mix them with the Herrings, with» 
Oyle, Vinegar, and Pepper, and keep them, clofe in a 
Gaily pot. 

Tnefe prove excellent to Eat, and. may be a good ingre- 
dient in fome Sawces.

way, and the fecond lay crofs thefe in the like maRncr> &c. 

3 . Then take a Pint of White-Wine-Vinegar, a Pennyworth 
of Cloves and Mace beat together, half a Pennyworth of the 
Powder of Saunders^ and a couple of Onyons minced or cut 
fnaall, put thefe into the Pan, and Baking it with the Wifcs 
Bread, the Bones will be found difToived, except the Back-, 
bone, which will be very C ifp. 

. 4. When cool, they are fit for Eating, with a Spoonfulf 
of their Pickle mingled with Elder- Vinegar, and if to be kept, 
cover the Pot clofe.

The places where they are commonly caught, are upon Banks, 
'Where the Dogger may Archor, the Principal is called the

to catch hold in the ground, with Ropes to weigh them, fitted

Moreover, there is a great Buoy at the hither end, called the 
Ship Aoy ; when a H 'arc Veered out, the Dogger comes to 
an Anchor, and Veers out her Cable , to which the former 
range of Lines is faftner*, rnd after (he hath rid 1 o or 12 hours,

of Fifli they put in a Lane of Salt, andifo fill up to the^Head 
which is well covered with Salt, where after 24 hours time 
they will fettle and make room for more ; and when the

common way, ...<.. ..^, 

i'. A N Ox being driven in cool one day, is flaugbtercd 
x\. the next, quartered, and after it hath hung a conve- 
nient time to cool, is cut into four pound pieces. 

2. The fame are very wcllrubb'd with Bay Salt, then put 
into Bins, Cribs, or Receptacles like Mangers, andalmoftbu* 
ried in Salt, for ihe fpace of a Fortnight, three weeks, or longer, 
that the bloody Pickle may run away waft. 

3. Th:n the Meat ii again well rubb'd and pack'd or trod- 
den into Cask, on a Cloath or Skin, with Salt betwixt every 
Lane or Lay , and being headed up is thrown by in Storc- 
houfes , for Ok weeks or two Months time , but fometimes 
will not keep a Fortnight , which is known by the fcent at 
the Boung. 

4. Then when the fame is to be Repackt, they turn the Boung 
of the cask downward, that all the bloody pickle may drein 
away into a waft Current. 

5.' Then all the Meat is taken out to be packt into Cask^ 
fmelling each piece, which is again well rubb'd with Salt, 
each lay being clofe packt with Salt between ^ and when full 
is roH'd to the pickling place to be pickling. 

The Pickle *s thus made. 

DIflblvc Bay Salt in frefli-water, fo long and to fuch a 
height, till upon Boyling with a brisk Fire^ and fcumming off 
great quantities of Dirt and Filth, it is in a rcadinefs to 
Kern or turrito Salt again , which is known by a Cream or 
Ice at the top. Then empty it into Coolers.

A 2. Rub it well every where, ftrew Soli at the bottom 
oftheCask,'and putin a Lay, which covering with a Skin or 
Ctoath, tread or pack it hik in, fprinkiing on tr Salt, and fo 
up to the top, where crowd in as much Salt jou can, and 
head it up. . .' ^ = ' • »' 

3. Then fill up the Cask often at the Boung with Brine, 
that may fearch every part. 

The Brine is thtts made. 

Mingle S»lt with Water, and let it bo diflblving two or three 
days time, ftirring the Salt at the Bottom^ and if there be 
more Salt than the water can melt, it will be found at the bot- 
tom, and ferve for a fecond ufe. 

This Brine is at its proper height, when the Salt is but jud 
di/Tolved, or when a piece of Beef will fwim in it, or an Egg 
the like but half funk in it. « . 

4. When the Meat is to be carried a long Voyage, through 
a hot Climate, it were fit it (hould be clofe Repacked with dry 
Salt, for Hiould the Brine be loft by Leakage , the Meat would 
grow rufty. 

The Excellencies of this way above the former, ( when there 
is no Repacking) are. 

The Blood and Gravy is prefer ved, much time, trouble and 
Saltfaved, and the Meat will be little or no falter at a Year « 
than at a Months end.

HoufeUld Expence. : 

IF it be a Chine or fiqgle piece of Beef, if the fame be moid, 
rub the Salt well on, but if the Meat be dry, dip it into, 
or noiilen it with water, before the Sattbe rubb'd on.

Othcrwlfe make a Brine as above dirc(flcd, fo ftrong SiS the 
Meat will fwimin it, and there is no more to do but to keep 
the Meat funk in it. 

This I know to have been the pra^ife with Beef in his 
Majcfties Boyling-Houfe, when he was Prince of WaUs^ and 
'tis at pre lent thepra<^ifeoffome Inns of Court an 1 Colledgcs; 
here it may be noted, that to keep Meat funk a day or two, 
will render it fait enough for prcfent fpending, yea and for long 
keeping, if after the Meat be taken out of the Brine, it be rub- 
bed with Salt, andhungupinawarmKitchin, fee what is faid 
to this purpofe in page 6, ii. 

After the Brine hath been twice or thrice ufed, Boy lit over 
a brisk Fire and skum it, and after it is thorough Cold it will 
fervc again. 

Ihavecaufed this method of faltingofMeat «n Brine, to be 
tried by Mr. Jofew ^«/l'aforefaid (and others ) with PortfeaSi\ty 
on aLoyn and Spare- Rib of Pork, which were both rendred very 
red 5 and in Roafting we found the Gravy kept in, and the 
very skin of the Loynof Pork to Eat tender : He alfo funk a 
Goofe in it 24 hoars, which was well feafoned, whereas ac- 
cording to the common method, there (howld have been about 
half a pound of Butter, with Salt put into the Body to have fea- 
foned the Goofe in Roafting ^ he likes this way fo well, that he 
much prefers it to the old CuAom of dry fi ting of Meat. 

He hath alfo funk a Leg of Mutton a Night in Brine, that 
was afterwards Roadcd, and then it was well feafooed to be 
Eat without Salt.

About SaltJPetrc* 



WHich of its fclf is a faltifti Liquor derived from Earth, 
and wc arc informed in the l^hilofofhical Tranf. 
MHiorjy N® 6. to this purpofe } that in the Moguls Dominions 
chiefly about jigra^ and the Villages heretofore Inhabited but 
now defcrted, they derived it from three forts < f Earth, to 
wit, Yellow, White, and Black , out of which they obtain 
the bcft, as moft free from common Salt , to this putting 
water, they tread it into a Pap, that the water may car. y a- 
way a fait Liquor with it, which afterwards Chriftallizcs into 
Salt-Pctrc, then they boyl or refine it twice or thrice over, as 
they defirc it courfer or purer, frequently fcumming it, till it 
Chriftallizes into Sal^Petre, which they -put into Earthen Pots, 
and fet them abroad in clear weather, that what impurity 
remains may fubfide or fall to the bottom , and afterwards 
break the Pots, and expofe it to the Sun to dry. 

In England, tubs are filled with dark falt-Earth, got out 
of Cellars and the Floores of Pidgeon-Houfes, &c. to which 
putting water it dreins away the faltilh humour, iuLo ano- 
ther Tub or Receptacle underneath (landing under the drip- 
ping hole of the uppermoft Tub. 

The Liquor thus obtained, as alfo the Salt-?ctre brought 
ovtthyihe Eafi' India Company j refembling a dull reddiih 
Sand, or courfc Mufcovado Sugar, is boylcd up to fcum and 
refine the fame, as many times as is thought necefTary. 

That which falls to the bottom of the Pan, is called ( as I 
ann informed ) Pctre-Salt, or the Salt of Salt-Petrc, itrefcm- 
bles common Salt, hath little or no taftof Saltncf>, butisefH- 
cacious in turning what is falted therewith Red, as Neats*

and out of it a Spiric may be drawn as red as Blood, it is com-

Lumps and Flvkes which arc as big as Loaf-Sngar or Jlloffry 
which fort being much the dearer, is alio ufcd by fomc out

tt^ AboHt Salt'Pefre, 

Neats Tongues, &c. as aforefjid, this fort is commonly fold 
by Drugftcis under the name of Salt i^etrc refined , the cx*^ 
pence of the bait of ^alt-Petre being but fmall, the Owners 
or Employers commonly give it the Workmen. 

The other Liquor m the ran at the fame time boyfed to a 
due Confiftency, expofed to the cold will (hoot into Chriftols, 
which they take ofFa^d put into flat BrafsPans, where it gra- 
nulates of It fclf and :makes Gunpowder for Ordinance. 

And if the Liquor be refined to a greater height, it fcrvcsto 
make Powder after the fame manner for Piftols and Fowling- 
pieces. 

The main difference betwixt them is, that Salt-Petrc is Vo- 
latile and t ikes Fire, the other fixt and void of fuch quality. 

We have Salt-Pctre alfo from Bnrhary^ but it is fouler and 
leaves a greater quantity of fixt Salt than that we have from 
the Eajh Indies, 

1 have heard it afferted in his Majeftics late Council of P'an- 
tationsjthat enough and good Salt-Pctre may be had froHj 
Montferraty &c. 

Salt- Pctre Salt as to gooJnefs hath no great Repute, yea 
common Salt mingled with Urine, Lime and Earth, caftupand 
kept in Banks for fix Months or longer, much increafeth Salt- 
petre ; whence 'tis probable that our Sea- Muds mentioned in 
page 10, may yield good quantities of Salt-Pctfcl 

In a Printed Letter of Mr. Gabriel Plat , to Mr. Samuel 
Hartlibt we read the Author affcrting, thn he knows by ex- 
perience that Salt-Petre is the moft rich ( ompoft in the World 
to multiply Corn, and that he hath feen fifty pounds worth of 
Salt-Petrc cxtrad^cd out of a Vault at Dewj^ate not very fpa- 
cious, which was formerly a Houfc of Oflfice, and not emp- 
tied, till the matter was throughly rotten. ^ nd feeing Sal-Am^ 
moniac yields a good rate in England, namely about half a 
Crown a pound, and is much ulied by Dyers, Tinmen, &c. 
and may be made here of Salt, &c. I (hall alfo digrcfs a little 
about the fame, and infert a Paper imparted by the Learned 
Chymift Mr. Molty to Mr. Dacres a Drugftcr in little Lhm^

Sal-ammoniac. 

THe name of Ammoniac is given to this Salt, from the 
Temple of Jupiter^ ^Au{a.&, or Ammos^ Mtuated in the 
midft of the Defarts of Lyhia^ becaufe this Salt was formerly 
found fublimated upon the fupcrficics of the burnt Sands of 
that Country. 

The Urine of Cnmds that generally travelled that way in 
Caravans^ in the Tilgr images that were continually made to 
this Temple, was the fi^ft and princip.il Matter, and tbe acid 
Salt of the Air, which impregnated this Salt in the Night time, 
by its Union ftopped the volatile Parts, which the heat of the 
Sun had othcrwifc diflTipated \ but having not this Salt of the 
Ancients, we are forced to ufe this fiftitiou i Salt made thus. 

Take 7 pound (or Pints of Urine,) one pound of common 
Salt, and two pounds of Wood- Soot, beat the ^alt and ^oot 
to Powder and put them into an Iron Pot , pour the Urine off 
them, boyl it to dry ncfs, then beat the dry Mafs and fublime it 
according to Art.

6. Forafniuch as old dry hard Salt, prefcrves what is bu-

time. 

7. It cannot but be good to prefcrve divers forts of Fruits

Hartichoaks, &c. 

One Thomoi AfarJJjall, a Fruiterer, informed me, that he 
covered a Feck of Peafe with their fhclls, and then covered 
the ftiells over with a heap of Bay-Salt, and they kept till 
the DJiddle of March^ and might have done much longer.

It were convenfent to lay the Salt' in a dry upper^Rbom 
on a Mat, which for preferving of Hartichoaks, might be firft 
ftrewcd with Salt, then the Hartichoaks fet in rows , with 
their tops downwards, then covered over with a Hair^Cloihi

OF THE 



Canary-Trade. 

Before we part with the Reader, it may not he unfit to 
entertain him with a Glafs of Wine ^ wherefore let 
fomeivhat about it enfue. 

M Afters of Ships, and moft Merchants, know it to be a 
Trade, at leaft of late, very difadvantagcous to Eni- 
land-i and that in thefc Refpec^s. 

1. That we pay doub'c the price, we forme'rly did for ir. 

2. That we are mightily over ballanccd in this Trade, the 
Canaries taking ofF more Commodities efpccially Fi(]i, from 
Ireland, and Icfs from England, than they formerly did. 

3. That by reafon this Trade lies open, every Ship ftrivcs 
to go firft, and return firft to Market j hence the Inhabitants 
knowing we are covetous of this kind of Wine, take thcop- 

' portunity of enhancing upon as. 

4. Which alfo gives them an opportunity of making and 
vending much bad Wine, made of Grapes, fomc Ripe, fome 
Green, fome Rotten, and this is that fort which commonfy 
arrives here before Chrifimas, whereas the better fort comes 
afterwards. 

For proof whereof, I rather cite Authors that have ccn- 
fidered it, than depend upon other Informations. 
' In a Quarto Book cntituled Trade- Reviv^ d , Printed in 
1659, Page 21, The Anth or de fires that the Canary Mer^

Baker, m 1659, refrefent the State of this Trade 
as followeth. 



r> 



1. That the Canaries htmg lObo Miles from S^ain^ the 
chief of their depeadance and Trade is with thcfe Nations, 
(meaning Great Britain and Ireland) for their Wines, ex- 
cept a few Shipt to the Weft-Indies. 

2. That the Englijh formerly^-bought thefe Wines there, 
at Ducats 28 fer Pipe , that is 8 i. 8 ^ which with Fraight, 
Cuftom, and Charges, flood in 1 3 pounds Sterh'ng, and now 
the firft coft is Ducats 62 fer Pipe, that is 20 LSs. The 
diflPerence is 12 pounds Sterling in a Pipe, fo that upon loooo 
Pipes yearly Imported as a Medium, we pay dearer in the firft 
Coft, Dy one hundred and twenty thoufand pounds than we 
did, fo that they who were formerly Poor, arc now become 
Rich. 

To which adding, that they have doubled thenr Cuflomsi 
and impofeda new Duty, fince BLks was at St. Crusi, for 
Repairing and Maintaining their Caflles and Fortifications^ 
he makes our Dammage each Vintage a great deal worfc. 

The Author of Britania-Langnens , an Odavo Book of 
Trade, Printed ini68o, page 183, thus States this Trade. 

Bejides to we have vafl quantities of Imported Spaniih 
Wines, we alfo purchafed with our Exported Commodities at the 
rate of 10 1. per Pipe » bnt now at ahont 20 1. per Pipe , and 
mofilj with Money, Bnlliony and Bills of Exchange , fo that 
'tis compftted that of latter yearsy it hath coft Enghnd near two 
hundred thoufand pounds per annum, in Imported Spanifh Wine, 
over and above the value of our Commoditiei Exported to the 
CdnmcSffromwhence he faith are Imported.

of the CMary-Trade ja^- 

Kir. James Boeve^ a Merchant commends this Book, as very 
ufeful and judicious, and this I mention to take an oppor* 
tunity to return him thanks, (which I hereby do,) for aeon- 
liderablc number of Printed Papers, and Books about Trade, 
which he was pleafed to bcftow upon me; amongft which 
one was Publifhcd in 1641, by Simon Smith, then Agent for 
the Royal Fijheryy entituled the Hcrring^Bufs Trade, in which 
Book the Reader may find the Dutch Laws, thence cited in 
page 58, &c, and a judicious account of the charge of a Bufs or 
Dogger, of the Nets, with the manner of their catching the 
Herrings. 

Now the inconvenience of the CAnary Trade aforeHiid being 
notorious, it is fit to propound the Remedy, viz.. 

That it being but one place, to prevent our felves from un- 
dermining one another, which caufcth them to enhance upon 
us there. 

1 . That the Trade thereof be reftrained to one fole Company, 
and after others at prefent concerned have had fome compe- 
tent time for cleariiig their Debts, and concerns, none but 
thofe of the Company, to have any freedom of Trade thi- 
ther* ; 

2. That for as tnudi as this Ttadc may be highly in/lru^ 
mental to promote the Fifhcry oi England (as follows, ) it 
be reftraincd to the ^0^4/ Fijhery Com^ny. 

3. That fuch Company raifc a fufficient Stock to carry on 
this Trade, which may be thoufand pounds more or 
len,as (hall be thought requifite. 

4. That every one that pleafeth have liberty to bring into 
this Company a Stock, not exceeding above 

5. That for every thoufand pounds fo put in for the Ca. 
vary Trade, he be obliged to bring in one hundred pounds 
as a Stock to carry on the Fiflicry Trade. 

Hence the Filhcry will be fupplied with Adventurers. 

Hence if the Filhery be well encouraged, they may have 
Ships belonging to them, which may be employed all the year 
round thus. 

I. In the Summertime, they may be fct Out to Greenland, 
to be employed in the Whale Fiflicty, which wc have either 
quite loft, or moft (Ir^ngely decline in.

2. That no Wine is fo plcafmg to us, as that of the Canaries. 

3. That there they will hold up their Price, and caufe the 
Company to lofc the ufe of their Stock , and the Freight of 
their Ships. 



To which 'tis anfmred.

To I. That if we can be content with Sfanifii Wine, to wit, 
Sherries, Malagas, Micant^ it will be all one to the Spaniard^ 
but much advantage to us, in regard we fhall have n^ar twice 
the quantity, and in barter for <So6ds, as we now have from 
the Canaries J where but little of our Goods go off, neither do 
we argue for diffolving , but only reducing that Trade. 

To 2. The Mountain Wines of Spain and Portugal arc very 
good, Green, not ovcrfweet or Lufcious, and pleafing. 

To 5. If we return, and take in a Lading in Spain and Por- 
tugal, where all Trade ought to be open and free, then that 
Objed^ion is anfwercd. 

Now how advantagious to the Woollen Manufacture , it 
might be to have a free Trade with Portugal^ for Wines, Oyle, 
Shoomack, &c. I find well aflcrted in a Printed Paper offered 
to the laft long Parliament , whereof I think fit to infert a 

Coppy. 

Whereas the Portugal Trade is very advantageoM to this Na- 
tion, becaufe it doth annually confume a great quantity of our 
ManufaUures, Fijh^dcc. and of late declines, becaufe the Sugar 
and other Commodities of that Country , are either Jo fain in 
Price {here,) or grown fo fcarce there , as that the Merchants tra- 
ding thither, cannot procure wherein to have Return, nor the Peo- 
pie of that Country wherein to mak^ fatisfaBion for the Guods 
they take-t which hath occajibned the fetting up of Fabricks of

the /aid Jnconvtniencyy being that Conmry ahnnds with fever J' 
forts of good Wine, and is capable to affordgre/it^ftantities there' 
of, which are in a manner totally Prohibited from being brough^ 
into thit Kingdom^ by the great Cnfiom charged on them^ of i6l' 
18 9. 1 1 d. per Ton^ as on Spanifli Wine , whereas their ufe^ 
nor goodnefsydoth not render them capable of paying more than. 
the French. 

It is humbly conceived^ it may be the Interefl of this Nation^ 
that by A^ of Parliament y the Cup: cm of the faid Wines may 
be abated, and that feeing the Freight from Portugal, is 40 s. 
per Ton more than from France, that the Cuflom may bf lefs 
than what is charged on the French Wine, for the Reafons 
following. 

1. The abating of the CufiomeSy would certaitdy introdnyH the 
expence of the faid Wine ^ and make them fervf to [apply the 
great want of Ret urns , at prefent experimented in that Trade ^ 
and confequently be a great means to increafe the Comfumption 
9fom MannfatioYy in that Country. 

2. It would dimimflj the Importation 0/ French Wines ^ which 
it is Well known, are purchafed with Monies^ whereas it is pro- 
babliy thefe will always be purchafed with our ManufaUory ; 
and it may be convenient ^ to encourage the growth of Wine in 
Portugal, thereby to lejfen the French-Trade. 

3. whereas the Prince of Portugal did about a year Jince^ 
make a Law to prevent the wearing of Foreign Cloth , Gold, 
and Silver' LacCy andfome other Commodities^ and did alfo fet 
up Fabricks of Bays^ and Serges in that Country , becaufe they 
have not Effecls to ballance their Importation , which hath al- 
ready proved of great prejudice to the faid Trade , and 
way prove very fatal if purfued ■: It may be hoped , that 
hy thus introducing the expence of their Commodities , and the 
taking of them in Exchange for our Manufa^ures , they m/ty 
be brought to negleU the Obfervation of the faid Law , and 
the faid Fabricksf becaufe theoccafion of them will be thus taken

The dcfign of this Book, is to prove the Excellency of our 
own Salt above any othc, wherefore it ought not to be difpa- 
raged without due Try ui, fwhichwe have not heard to be hi- 
therto attempted/^ wherein they may have the help of fome able 
Fifhermen, that have much Experience in Salting (or curing) of 
Filh : Moreover the Fid-imongers affirm , there cannot want 
good Succefs, in regard Herrings require a better Salt than 
Pilchards, and the former, to wit , Herrings, cannot well be 
cured with Bay-Salt, (much woilc than EngUflj refined, j and 
the latter (wz,. Pilchards) may.

1. The Fi(hmongcr? fay, there ought be be a Law made, to 
rcftrain the carching of Pilchards , (as in Holland there is of 
Herrings j fee page 107) after fuch time as the Shoal begins to 
be lean, (hotten, or fick, as ^ good medium to preferve, and 
increafe the Breed. 

2. 1 h;it the ihottcn Pilchards, (as well as Herrings,) cured 
witharefin:d Salt, may probably be vended at other Mar- 
kets,- withnolefs, ( if not <?,rcat€r; advantage. 

3. Thet0t.1l Prohibition of French-'^Vik is not aimed at, but 
the j!)!fcouraging the expence of ic, at home; it may be ftill 
had in France, an J c.v>^icd to Ne^fo midland without Dammage,

Concerning T ITSl. 



:\ 



* ^ 



•J hivc heard divers Merchants of late years affirm, they could 
X not get the Intercft of their Principal by it ; and when the 
Debate about Tin- Farthings happened, the Prw^rr^rj affirmed, 
that there was 22000 /. worth of Tin at Smyrna remaining, 
that had been fome years in the hands of one Mr. Pythorne^ a 
Fador there, that he could not fell to any advantage j and it's 
well known that Tin was never fo cheap at home, nor more 
of it lying on our hands than now, albeit his Majefty ever fincc 
1666. hath received no benefit by his Prerogative of praremp- 
tion, nbr is like to have any for the future; whereas in former 
times it was farmed at 12000 /. pfr /?«^««i Rent. 

The Cafe being thus, give me leave to make a Digreffion a- 
bout the improvement of OLir Native Commodities. 

Endeavours have been on foot to reftorethis fall 'n branch of 
the Revenue by Farming it of his Majefty, and coming to a 
Compofition with the Miners of Cornwal to take off all the Tin 
the Mines yield, or at leaft 1200 Tons per annum^ but there 
were two Rubs in the way •, the one was , the Convocation 
could not well come to fuch an Agreement, till an A61 of Par- 
liament was obtained to bind all particular Miners to ftand to 
fuch contrads asthefaid Convocation fhouldmakc ; The other 
was, the Farmers would not undertake fuch Bargain without

1^6 • • Concerning Tin. . . ' v 

Covenanting with his Majefty, to fppply £/7^/^«^, Ireland^ end 
the Plantations with Tin Farthings, a pound weight of them 
to be cut into i6 Pence, that by the profit of thclc Farthings 
the Farmers might be enabled to pay their Rent. . ' ;';.'. 

This Dcfign was oppofcd by the Mint, as an al ufe to be 
put upon the Nation ^ many arguments were then urged 
againft Tin Fa:things> whereofl (hill enumerate fomcfewj as. 

I ., That a Metal might be made whiter and harder than 
Tin, of Litharge of Lead , (that u refined Lead, which proves 
extraordinary hard and white, ) in:orporated with Sp<r/rfr , and 
fome Poyfonous Ingredients, Arfenick-, Regulpu oi j4mimonyy^t. 

2: That fuch Metal, when worn, would not yield above 

wo Pence a Pound jOr little more, and no Pewrerer durft ufe it, 
as being contrary lo the Laws or Orders oftheir Company. 

3. '1 hat Tin tarthings might be Coyned with a Hammer, 
cafi: in a Mold, fqueezcd in a Vice, and be counterfeited by 
any Pewterer, Letter- F oh/; der, Th:k{/', PluMmer ^ Smith ^ GU- 
fiery Tinman^ Watchmaker , &c. 

4. Hence a Qnery was put to the Farmers, wlicihcr they 
would change all that were brought to thera or not, good or 
bad, either made by thcmn^Ivcs or others ? And if fo, who 
fhould allow the Country an4^ City Brewers their Charges, in 
lending them up to London In. Drays and Wagons , with 
Tellers.' 

5. They refufing, it was inferred, that if Tin Farthings were 
Eftabliihed, His Majefty rauft receive His Revenue of Excife 
(and the Duke ofTor^ his Poftagej in Tin Farthings, in regard 
a Brewer cannot avoid the taking of much Money in> Tin Far- 
things at home of Tub Women and Firkin-Men, and abroad 
©f the Ale- Houfc- keepers that arc his Cuflomers. 

Thefe Arguments ruined that wretched Defign, and I pray 
let it fleep in its Rubbifh. 

Afterwards one Mr. Vane Deccafed, propofed a Defign to 
make Tin the fundas of a Bankj to be managed for his Ma- 
jcfty's advantage by Commiflioners that were able Merchants, 
that could pay the Miners by Contract for the Tin quarterly, 
and be reimburfed by Sales, when it ftiould bear a price, or by 
others that would have credit in the faid Bank; And His Ma- 
jcfty to promote the fame, bought up 60000 /. of Tin when it 
was cheap, to wit, at 3 /. 8 /. 6d. the Hundred weight, of 
which this, was the event. The 



V. 



Concerning Tin. itj 

The Plot breaking out, and the Parliament not fitting, futh 
Contiadlcoutd not be made with the Miners ; nd the faid Tin 
after it had with Warehoufe room, and Jntereft )f Stock, cofl 
about 3 /. 16 s. the Hundred weight, was fold ar the Africa}/- 
Hoiife at about 3 /.the Hundred weight,or little more •, ; nd thofc 
that bought it fo, Shipp'd off moft of it to HolUnd^ and arc 
great Lofers by the bargain. The caufe whereof is this : 
' The Ea^ 'Indies abounds with Tin, which the Dutch buy 
there at about % d. a Pound, and bring it home for Ballaft 
Freight free-, and they have brought home fo much in former 
years, as to bring down the price of ors See a Eook ot the 
Safl'Jndia Trade, Printed in 1667. where in page 9 you have 
this paffage. : 

As for Tin there isvaft quantities in fome parts of hidia^ 
the Vntch during the time of the late Proeemption of Tin, htv- 
rig brought home in two ye >rs 4 or 500 Tons; And it might be 
more advantagiousto the E?iglifl) Company, not only to Tian- 
fport Tin from one partof /«^/4 to another, rather than to fend 
it from Englatid j butalfo to bring Tin from India ta England^ 
for Ballaft of their Ships that come with Pepper from Bantam^ 
did they not prefer t^c Kingdoms Intereft before their private 
Profit. 

The Dfftch'm Angufl 1678, brought home, as a Letter from 
//0//4W mentions, above 1 50 Torts, which is faid to be 5 j. a 
Hundred weight better than ours \ and at firft fold it at 3 / 5 s. 
the Hundred weight, thenfcH to 3 /. then to 2 /. 15 j. and ours 
at that time would not fell for above 2 /. 10 /. 

The cafe being thus, to apply a Remedy, I humbly addrcfTed 
my fdf to the Honourable the Members of Parliament that 
ferved for the Counties of Devon and Cornwal ; and Propoun- 
ded, 

That whereas we now in England make Salt the beft yet 
known in the World, and arc notwrthaftnding much oppreiTed 
by Foreign Salt ; to Redrefs which, the Saltworkers have for 
many years endeavoured to bring on afmall Excifc on our own, 
torecompenccHisMajcI^y for thelofs of the Cuftoms of Fo- 
reign , to be kept out by a high Duty .

158 Concerning Salt. 

Promifing my Tr«arifc of Salt On a good forwardncfs for t!ic 
Prefs J in which (hould be handled the feveral ways of making 
of Sale in England and other Countries, and fetting forth the 
Excellency and manner of ufing our own in curing both Flcfti 
and FiQi, for the longeft of Voyages through the hotteft Cli- 
mates. J ..r;- 

2. That they woi^ld vouchfafe to make ufe of fuch opportv^ 
nity to remove all burthens upon Tin, as well Sealing Duty of 
4 ^. a Hundred weight, which may come to 5000/. fir Annkm 
(except a competent Recompencc to the Officers for fealing 
fuch as is free fi om Iron and Drofs, according to Conftitution ; ) 
as alfo exporting Duty of 7 /. 4 <5^. a Hundred, which may conic 
to 7000 /. a year, or more. 

3. That then a Farm of all the Tin the Mines produce, to be 
let to the Ttirhy and Pewterer^s Company ; the one will fo re- 
gulate the Price abroad, and the other at home, that we (hall 
not be undermined by the Dutch. 

This done, the faid Companies may ereft a fafe Bank, and 
not be dammaged, albeic they have Tin on their hands to a vad 
quantity and value. The advantages of Banks are great; 
wh jreof I (hall mention but one ; It enables the Hollanders to 
Trade with a dcad>tock: ?cwit, when a Laden Ship arrives, 
tlic Goods ars appraifed,dcpofited in the Bankers Ware-houfes, 
and Credit given at home or in Foreign parts, for about three 
quarters of their va'ue ; which is an incredible advantage in 
Trade. - ' ,.-. . . ^m. ' •..:} 

I further humbly reprefented to them, that in the Ufurpcr s 
time fuch an Esccifeas afiTcfaid in page 1 54brought in 260C0 /. 
fer ^;2ffiinr, when Fiihery Salt was excepted^ and paid nothing, 
the which was obfcrved to be a notable backdoor and a CJoak 
to many fallacious petcnces, whereas laying the duty univcr- 
fal, the rc-'cnue raifcd by Filhery Sal", being employed for 
the advantage of a Fifhery Trade, (hall much more advance the 
dcfjgn, than the payment of fuch duty can hinder it, cfpecially 
feeing our Neighbours cannot be furniOit with Salt for that pur- 
pofe fogood and cheap as we by 12 or 15 fer Cent'^ And in 
cafe the fame be employed in the Royal Fijhery Company in Lom^ 
don^ out-parts may complain their Fi(heries are difcouraged ; 
: to which miy be replied, that at London a duty is paid upon Bal- 
lait, but not the like in the out- Ports or moH: of theoi, where a

it miiy produce 38000 or 40000 /. a ycir. And fuch' a ftock as 
that Employed to encourage OJr Manufadures, fhall enrich the 
Nation much above a Million a year j I offer how,, and moft 
humbly move you to promote : 

1. In fctting upa F;(hery Company, tohave^ifeooo /. a ycdr 
given them to Build Ships and Veffels, to encourage Adventu- 
rers to undertake the Fifhery Trade, and [he making of Twine, 
Nets, Canvas, and Cordage, at C/^^-i^ifmvf// Work houlc, not 
only for their o^A^nufe, butalfofor hs Majefties ftorc- , as in 
the latter part of that Treatifc W'S propounded. And if they 
bercndred a Council of Trade, (for whi.h rcafons were then 
given, why ihey are or may be a mofl proper coniUtution, ) 
they will gr> far in earntn:^ fuch benevolence, and doubtlcfs 
give fuch advice as followed fhall redrefs the aggreivances of 
the Nation about Trade and Mandfad^urcs, to which I fubj)yn; 
that without confidcrabli: Encouragements the FiChcpy of jE«^- 
Und will be inconfid cable, and that it ought to be undertaken 
in the Nartk and JrtjhSeas for Foreign vend, but of this at 
large^God-willing in anothcrTrcatife,at prefent fee page 67, 107. 

To which nay be added, that Doggers miy be employed, 
from Mich^ielffMs to Lady tUy in a Winter Fiihcry to ibpply 
London with freih and barreldCod, perchance witn advantage 
(though hitherto nothing but lofs and that conliderable hath 
occurred ; ) whereas on the contrary in Summer a lofs enOies 
cither by a North-Sea or Iceland Fifhery, or the Veffels muft 
belaid up, and the Men f though not theComp^n es Boys) dif- 
chargcd, and not to be had when the Winter Fiihcry is to be 
renewed. 

2. There is anew Art of preparing, whitening, anddreffing 
both of Hemp and Flax, (afterwardis more particularly dcfcribcd 
in my faid Plea,) that (hall render it of a filvcr Colour, fo fine 
that of onepound of it>a thrcd may be made : o Miles Iong,and in 
value to 50/ or 3 /.the pound weight Hence we want no Foreign 
Linnen nor Canvas, which may be barr'd*out by a high duty. 

Of the refufe or Tow thereof, ofRaggs, Old Fifhery Ne ts 
aftd Sayls, may be made Paper; whcreofwelpcndin £w^/-«»^

and Hottand ^ and tbe Art thereof is attained in England ; but 
to encourage the fame here, there wants a higher duty on 
Foreign Pciper ; and a Company with a good ftock to under- 
lakc the fame •, the which might be the Stationers Company, 
with other Adventurers ; to whom for encouragement might be 
allowed the ufe of 50CO /. fcr annim Craiu •, to be taken out 
in Stiitionary Wares for the fupplyof all his Ma jefties Offices. 
This doth not fuppofe that any that are not of the Company 
arc reP.rained from undertaking it, on their own private 
Adventures. • 

3. By the like encouragement, the Upholftcrers with others 
might be induced to undertake the Manufaiiure of Ta- 
pilfry hangings, the benefit of gaining fuch Man^fafturc is 
great, 'vi^L, 

1. It will favean expenceof Foreign Wool, and beget an 
cxpcnce of our own, to the value of One hundred thoufand 
pounds per annnm, now Imported in Tapeftry- hangings. 

2. It wiil caufe our Cloaths to go off in Turkey m Barter, to 
procure raw Silk to work up with the faid Hangings. 

3. It will in the Ballance of Trade favc the value of fuch 
Hangings yearly to the Nation, and in time become a Staple 
Gommodity to Ship off, in regard we can have Wool, Silk, 
and Pfovifions, much cheaper here than in Flanders and Bra- 
banty the fole Provinces where this Manufadlure was formerly 
made, the skill whereof is now well attained in England'^ 
but Encouragement in its Infancy, by keeping out Foreign, 
and a ftock to carry it on, is wanting. 

4. It will employ many thoufands of poor People in Carding* 
Combing, and Spinning, befides Dyers, Weavers, Worfted- 
workers, Drawers, and Defigners. .^ee the excellent Propo- . 
fal in Print of Mr. Francis Poyntz.M\s Maje/lies Tapi ft ry- maker. 

Laftly, If there be yet a Surplus, the Revenue of the Mint 
craves it.*, the faid Revenue was much t(»o (hort for Coyning 
any confiderable quantity of our Mcneys mto fmaller pieces 
than Shillings, even before the Prohibition of Fr-^«cJb- Wines, 
('which paid 10 /. a Ton Coynage duty,) and became a notable 
Abridgment of fuch Revenue, namely, 6000/. a year. More- 
over to Coyn more Moneys fmall, is the beft way to accom- 
modate the People, and prevent Exportation 






:c.

To which may be added that the Mint Aft being but tem- 
porary , it together with lo s. a Ton'Coynagc duty on Wines, 
&c. and 20 Ihilhngs on Brandy , ceafed upon DifTolving 
the Parliament about November^ 1680. fo that when 'tis icfto- 
red, I hope there will be a caution in it^ to reftorc Lopper 
Farthings much wanted, aslikcwiicfmali filver-Moicys, 
. To this Difcourfe of our Manufadurcs (to which many more 
may be added, and confequcntly the Poor employed in them,) 
I further intinjiate, that the moi\ renowned Sir Wilham Petty hath 
writ an Elaborate Treatile, mjlt worthy publick View, intituled 
Political j^rithmetick, in which he alTcrts, we mciy employ the 
Poor, and gain two Millions a year more than we do , by the 
People we have,, without ufing any qI the Mediums here pro- 
pounded. 

To which might be fubjoyned, that we have either almoft or 
quite loft many Manufadures upon the ceafing of the lixcife, 
as Iron, Battery, Brafs, Cordage, &c. And that divers other 
Man ufdClures might be gained by a higher duty of Cuftoms on 
Foreign, whereby the poor might be Employed, the Exporta- 
tion of Coy n and an ovcrballance of Trade prevented , a Dif- 
courfe whereof might be a large, ufcftil, but uneafie task. 

Laftly, It is to be hoped, that none of his Ma jeAies Officers 

that have long enjoyed profitable Employments , will ft>r the 

future hinder thefe meafures without pro^-ounding better ^ and

monly bold j which if you diftill over again with frefti Scurvy- 
Grafs^ it will be yet ftronger. 

Then take a quart of this Spirit, put it in a Bottle, and put to 
it three ounces of Jo/lop grofs Powdered, Hop it and let it ftand 
warm either in a Stove, or by a good Fire for 3 or 4 days, til 
you fee it grow very red with tindure of the J<?///)/7,and then pour 
it otf clear, and this is the Golden Purging Spirit, of which a 
finall Ipoonfull in a draught of Ale, Beer or Wine, is a moderate 
Purge, althoughjt wcreto bewifhed, that there were a better 
and fafer way of Purging than by this inlulion in Strorig- water, 
being unfit for hot Bodies ; though for their profit, th^y who 
fell it commend it alike to all. 

I. This was communicated by a worthy Gentleman. '' '
