THE BAKERS' HAND BOOK. 



To All Kinds of Bakers. 



After an experience of fifteen years as a 
cake baker in various bakeries in the east, 
west and the south I am lead to believe that 
a small handbook containing- a variety of 
recipes would meet with the favor of many 
bakers and beginners of any branch. 

Many a baker is oblig-ed to leave a g-ood 
offer for a position g-o unaccepted for the 
simple reason that he may not feel sure 
enoug-h of being- able to make cakes, etc. 
satisfactorily, but this can be readily over- 
come if he makes use of these recipes. 

In writing- this book I have desired to 
g-ive a carefully selected collection of recipes 
for cakes, ice cream and home-made candies, 
which will meet the demands of the people. 



THE BAKERS' HAND BOOK. 



The enclosed recipes I have used with 
very good results and would recommend 
them to every baker for a trial. 

For baking- cakes of any kind, first class 
winter wheat should be used; butter must be 
washed with clear water several times just 
before mixing - your cakes or pastry. 

The manufacturing baker should use the 
best of material, as it is the cheapest 
way to keep up trade; people in this county 
prefer to do their own baking unless they 
are sure their baker is using good material 
for baking his bread, cakes, etc. 



Respectfully, 

Eugene Schurk.
