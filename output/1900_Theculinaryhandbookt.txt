PREFACE. 

This book has been prepared with the aim of gathering into a single volume the largest practi- 
cable collection of every day recipes suited to the catering fraternity iu the English language, mak- 
ing it as nearly as possible the choicest and most complete work of its kind. 

The name which is given it indicates the principle upon which the book has been made: namely, 
that it might serve as a book of reference; as a comprehensive exhibit of the growth, and condi- 
tion of the requirements of the traveling public. 

The work is not a cook book, and does not pretend to teach cookery, yet to those that have al- 
ready received the fundamental ideas of cookery, it will be found to be the best theoretical teache- 
obtainable, as it clearly shows what the combinations of the dishes are and what they look like, and 
how they should be served. 

Necessarily limited in extent, it yet contains more practical matter than any similar publica- 
tion, presenting over four thousand selections. It is believed that of the culinary writers for the 
catering profession acknowledged by the intelligent and cultivated to be great, none, whether 
Foreign cr American have heretofore written the dishes in plain English without the foreign affec- 
tation of "A LA", an affectation when appearing on the Bill of Fare causing the guest to expect 
much, and disappointing him by receiving little. 

The dusty road traveled so much by other writers in makmg their books contain five times as 
many pages as are necessary has been avoided, and we hope that one of the special merits of this 
volume is its brevity. 

With these brief explanations. The Culinary Handbook is placed before the catering fraternity, 
with the hope that it will be deemed worthy of its title. ^

THE CULINARY HANDBOOK. 



ABSINTHE— A liqueur made principally fromALMONDS— The best for culinary purposes is 



wormwood, anise, angelica, coriander seeds and 
alcohol, sometimes adulterated with aromatic 
resins and dangerous colorings; its uses are 
chiefly as a drink diluted with water, and in 
making many of the American mixed drinks. 

ACETIC ACID— The foundation of all vinegars; 
used by confectioners when making icing from 
whites of eggs, to facilitate the beating. 

AERATED WATERS— Such as Vichy, Apolli- 
naris, Carlsbad water, Friedrichshall bitter, 
etc., are obtained from the springs of nature 
and recommended for the relief and cure of 
different complaints of the human system. Imi- 
tation aerated waters mostly contain sugar, and 
are sold as pop, such as ginger ale, sarsaparilla, 
etc. The artificial waters are simply pure 
waters sweetened, flavored and charged with 
carbonic acid gas. In Paris oyster shells are 
washed, and broken into small pieces, and, 
under the action of vitriol, yield the carbonic 
acid gas. 

ALBUMEN — An opaque fluid found plentifully 
in eggs, meats, fish and succulent vegetables, 
especially asparagus. It is the most nourish- 
ing substance known; used in its raw state from 
whites of eggs by cooks chiefly in clarifying 
purposes. 

ALCOHOL — A colorless liquid obtained from 
fermenting sugar; is found in all wines and 
spirits and is the intoxicating quality of them. 
It is largely used in making flavoring extracts, 
by diluting the oil of the flavor required with 
the alcohol. Wood alcohol obtained at any 
drug store is the best and cleanest material to 
be used in singeing poultry and game. 

ALLIGATOR PEAR— A fruit found in the West 
Indies and Mexico, but can be bought at most 
of the fruit stores in season; the large green 
ones are the best; they are served the same as 
canteloupes, or sliced into a salad seasoned 
with pepper, salt and the juice of a lime. 

ALLSPICE— The product of the pimento shmb, 
used as a food flavoring. When ground it has 
a graining of a ruby coloring; purchased in its 
ground state, is often adulterated with mustard 
busks. 



the Jordan; it is about an inch long, flat with a 
clear brown skin, sweet and rather tough. In 
making almond soup seven-eighths sweet and 
one-eighth bitter almonds should be used. 

SALTED ALMONDS— Made by blanching, skin- 
ning, and frying them in butter oil till nicely 
browned, then dusting with salt; make a nice 
appetizer, or hors d'oeuvre.

monds, but after salting, well dusted with 
cayenne pepper. 

ALUM — A white astringent salt, often used to 
whiten flour, to quickly clear gin, to improve 
the color of inferior red wines. 

ANCHOVIES— The Dutch are always cleaned of 
their scales. The French are not, and are 
larger. Anchovy paste bought on the markets 
is often adulterated with red-ochre and Veni- 
tian red. 

ANCHOVY CANAPES— Slices of fried bread, 
one-quaiter inch thick, spread with anchovy 
paste or butter, a filleted anchovy on top, the 
edges decorated with minced whites of hard 
boiled egg. 

ANCHOVY AIGRETTES— Filleted anchovies 
washed, then laid for three hours in a pickle of 
olive oil, vinegar and red pepper; taken up, 
drained, dipped in batter and fried a light color 
in very hot fat; served garnished with lobster 
coral and sprigs of parsley. 

/J^CHOVY TOAST— Slices of toast spread with 
a mixture made of three-fifths essence of an- 
chovies, one-fifth grated Parmesan cheese, and 
one-fifth minced filleted anchovies and chopped 
parsley. 

ANCHOVY ALUMETTES— Preserved ancho- 
vies in oil, drained, rolled in very thin pie paste, 
fried; served garnished with fried parsley. 

ANCHOVY FRITTERS — Filleted anchovies 
coiled up, dipped in batter and fried a light 
color in hot fat; served garnished with fried 
parsley.

best for culinary purposes, as the meat, besides

BEEF — For culinary purposes is of two kinds, 
the steer and the cow. Steer beef is superior 
and the flesh should be of a bright red marble 
with yellow fat, and a thick outside layer of 
fat under a fine grained skin; the lean should 
be firm and elastic when pressed with the fing- 
ers; the suet should be dry and crumble easily. 
Cow beef is of closer grain, the fat is white in- 
stead of yellow, and the flesh of a darker red, 
BULL beef is sometimes worked off on the 
unwary by the packing houses when shipping 
to distant cities, especially so in the form of 
tenderloins; it is large, coarse, very dark in 
color, and unfit for table use. 

BEEF k la MODE — Any piece of solid beef, 
preferably the silverside of the round, is larded 
with seasoned strips of larding pork, then laid 
in dilute vinegar containing slices of carrot, 
turnips and onions with whole spices, for sev- 
eral hours. It is then taken out and quickly 
roasted in oven to get the outside seared, then 
placed in saucepan, covered with a piquante 
sauce, lid of saucepan put on, then gently sim- 
mered till tender; served in slices with a gar- 
nish of braised vegetables and some of the 
sauce it was cooked in, (also called, "pot roast" 
and "sour pot roast.") 

BEEF STEW, GERMAN STYLE — Cold beef 
k la mode is cut into small pieces and heated in 
a sour sauce; served garnished with potato 
pancakes. 

BEEF ROAST— Preferably the set, or seven ribs 
from the shoulder to the loin is for hotel use. 
The lower end of the ribs, called SHORTRIBS, 
should be roasted with another pan over the 
top, so as to become more juicy and tender 
than by roasting them open. The usual accom- 
paniment to roast beef is some of the pan or 
dish gravy with a slice of Yorkshire pudding, 
while for the shortribs a little grated horse- 
radish and browned potatoes is best. 

BOILED BEEF— The best pieces for boiling 
are the flank, brisket, and short ribs, they 
should be boiled tender with a flavoring of veg- 
etables, and served with horseradish sauce, 
cream sauce and carrots or suet dumplings, or 
mixed vegetables such as carrot, turnip, onion, 
cabbage and potato. 

CORNED BEEF— Flank, short ribs, brisket or 
rump of beef is put to soak in brine made of 
twenty-five pounds of salt, twelve ounces of 
rock saltpetre, two pounds of sugar and fifteen 
gallons of water, all boiled together, skimmed, 
cooled, the beef then put in with a cover on 
and a weight on that to keep the beef under 
the brine, (ready for use in a week to ten days). 



BOILED CORNED BEEF— The meat put to 
boil in cold water, scum taken off as it rises, 
then allowed to simmer till tender (about four 
hours) served in slices with cabbage, parsnips, 
carrots, sometimes with all three vegetables; 
also with suet dumplings; sometimes with a 
brown sauce and garnished with brussels 
sprouts. 

SPICED BEEF — A whole flank of beef with 
bones, gristle and inner skin removed, laid out 
flat, outside skin downwards, then rubbed with 
a mixture of salt, ground pepper, mace, allspice, 
cloves and ginger; rolled up and tied, then put 
to soak for ten days with some pickle from the 
corned beef brine to which is added whole 
cloves, peppers, allspice and bay leaves. When 
to be cooked, it is taken from the pickle, wiped 
dry, dipped in fat that is near cool so as to take 
on a good coating, then rolled in a dough made 
of plain flour and water, placed in a medium 
oven and slowly baked (five to six hours). If 
to be served hot, cut in slices and serve with 
piquante sauce and garnish with small cut vege- 
tables. If to be served cold, as is generally 
done, the dough is left on till thoroughly cold, 
or till to be served; even for a month it will 
not spoil if the dough is not disturbed. Served 
cold in thin slices garnished with pickles. 

ALL SALT, CORNED OR SMOKED MEATS 
IF SIMMERED TILL DONE, INSTEAD 
OF QUICK BOILING, and allowed to cool in 
the water they were simmered in, will be found 
always more juicy and tender, and capable of 
longer keeping. 

DRIED BEEF— The thick flank is the part gen- 
erally used; divided lengthwise in its natural 
section, it is put in a pickle of salt, saltpetre, 
sugar and molasses for two weeks, then hung 
up and smoked like hams, (also called smoked 
beef). 

CHIPPED BEEF IN CREAM— Very thin slices 
or shavings of dried beef, blanched, drained, 
and mixed into cream sauce or reduced cream.

slices of dried beef, again cut into strips like 
short matches, blanched, drained, mixed with 
beaten eggs and a little milk, scrambled around 
in a pan with a little butter till eggs are set, 
served either plain, or on toast. 

FRIZZLED BEEF ON TOAST— Very thin sli- 
ces of dried beef, blanched, drained, then 
tossed with frothing butter over a quick fire; 
served on toast. 

SMOKED BEEF WITH SPINACH — Dried

by the guest when written in plain English, and 
often uncalled for and consequently left over 
when the "k la" is attached. Any of the fore- 
going garnitures given to braised sirloins, apply

BRIE — Name of a very- rich cream cheese made

inch thick, wrapped in parchment paper, put 
into thin wooden boxes and imported to this 
country; it is, however, very much, and fairly 
well imitated by our own cheese manufacturers. 

BRANDY — A spirit distilled from wines, is clear 
and sparkling. In the year 1878 the vineyards 
of the Charente were devastated by the phyl- 
loxera, causing the annual production, which 
averaged 170,000,000 gallons, to fall in 1898 to 
only 11,000,000; consequently, since 1878, only 
a very small quantity of genuine brandy has 
been shipped to this country, the bulk being a 
blend of grain spirit flavored with brandy. An 
oil distilled from brandy is used with a spirit 
in producing an imitation that is sold as cook- 
ing brandy. 

BRANDY SAUCE— Water, lemon juice, sugar 
and grated nutmeg brought to the boil, butter 
and flour sizzling in another sauce pan, the 
flavored water strained into it, stirring at the

sired flavor added. 

BREAD — A combination of flour, salt, sugar, 
•rater and yeast, mixed, set to rise, kneaded, 



23 

risen again, molded, proved and baked. The 
different kinds of bread on the market is legion, 
and with all sorts of claims, principally for the 
benefit of health and digestion, such as "whole 
meal," "gluten," "aerated," "steamed," "die- 
titic," "diabetic," "buttermilk," "dyspepsia," 
etc., which argument may be based on sound 
doctrine or not, at least, doctors, chemists and 
anylists, are continually arguing the pro. and 
con. of the different claimants as the following 
quotation will show for itself. 

WHITE VERSUS BROWN BREAD— There 
appeared in the St. Bartholomew's Hospital 
report a very interesting communication on the 
relative digestibility of white and brown bread 
by Drs. Lauder, Brunton and Tunnicliffe. 
While the authors admit that, regarded from a 
purely chemical point of view, the nutritive 
value of brown bread is greater than white, 
they maintain that this is not so when consid- 
ered from the physiological side. The authors 
point out that it is absurd to take the mere 
chemical composition as an index of the value 
of food stuff, as a stick of charcoal, the atmos- 
pheric air, a little water, some sea salt, contain 
all the elements of a typical diet. Hence, the 
greatest importance attaches not only to the 
composition, but to the ways in which the var- 
ious constituents are combined so that they 
can be readily and easily assimilated. The 
conclusion that the authors come to is mainly 
that, although brown bread, both on account 
of its large percentage of mineral matters and 
fat forming constituents, is chemically superior 
to white bread, yet these constituents do not so 
readily pass into the blood as in the case of 
white bread, and that, weight for weight, white 
bread is more nutritious than brown. In spec- 
ial cases where there is a deficiency of mineral 
matter, and especially in cases of growing 
children, when large quantities of these are 
required for production of bone and tissue, 
brown bread may be useful, but even in these 
cases, if these mineral salts, and especially 
salts of calcium, are supplied by other means, 
white bread is preferable to brown. 

BRAINS — Of animals are esteemed by the cook 
in producing delicate entries, and are remuner- 
ative to the proprietor on account of their small 
cost. They must, before cooking, be thor- 
oughly cleansed of the skin and blood that 
covers them; they are easily digested, and fairly 
nutritious. 

SCRAMBLED BRAINS— Pigs, sheep, calf or 
beef brains, as there is scarcely any difference 
in the flavor, being all composed of the same 
material, are cleansed, par-boiled in salted 
water with a dash of vinegar, taken up, drained, 
cut into small pieces, added to an equal volume 
of beaten eggs, seasoned with salt, pepper and 
nutmeg, poured into a pan containing butter, 
and scrambled around till set. Served on toast 
(optional), garnished with croutons and parsley.

BRAISE AND BRAISING— A term applied to 
foods that are cooked by a top and bottom heat. 
The pot or braiser has a cover that fits tightly 
and a receptacle to hold lighted charcoal or 
coke, so that the heat descends on top of the 
foods. The general way of the average estab- 
lishment, however, who, as a rule, are not sup- 
plied with a braiser, is to take a shallow sauce- 
pan or saiitoir, into which is placed the foods, 
together with onion, carrot, parsley, bay leaves 
and whole cloves (and according to the food, 
with other accessories, but the five mentioned 
spices and vegetables are always included in a 
braise) and moistened with stock or sauces, as 
the recipe may require; the cover of the saiitoir 
is then put on and placed in the oven, so that 
it gives an even heat, top, bottom and sides. 
When the foods are cooked to requirement they 
are taken up and the remaining liquor is called 
BRAISE. Braising, besides imparting delicate 
flavors to the foods thus cooked, is also an ex- 
ceptional good way of making tough meats 
tender, as the toughest parts of beef can be 
made into fine entrees by braising them. See 
braised dishes under heading of " BEEF."

still country butter as is often to be purchased 
by the steward na th<> open market is someti mes 



colors, white, green and red; appreciated by 
the average guest in any of the following forms: 

BOILED CABBAGE— If young require about 
fifteen minutes, if old twenty to thirty minutes 
are required for boiling. They should be cut 
in quarters, the stalks removed, and then the 
leaves be separated. It is quite a common 
thmg for the cooks to boil them simply in 
quarters without separating the leaves; not 
only is this a dirty way, but seldom is the inner 
part done till the outer leaves are cooked too 
much and rendered tasteless. After the leaves 
are separated they should be soaked in cold 
water to which is added salt; if this precaution 
is neglected slugs and various small insects may 
be retained in the leaves. When thoroughly 
washed put to boil in boiling salted water with 
a small piece of common washing soda; cook 
them with the saucepan lid OFF. As the smell 
of boiling cabbage often reaches the guests' 
rooms over the kitchen, a piece of stale bread 
crust or charcoal tied in a piece of muslin 
boiled with the cabbage, will be found to obvi- 
ate the smell. When done they should be 
turned into a colander and the water pressed 
cut, then seasoned with salt, pepper and but- 
ter. The too common way of sending cabbage 
to the table floating in the water it was boiled 
in cannot be condemned too strongly. 

BAKED CABBAGE WITH HAM — Fresh 
boiled cabbage with the water pressed out, 
mixed with drawn butter, placed in a baking 
pan, sprinkled with grated cheese and ham, 
baked, served with a slice of roast ham on top.

cabbage cut fine, then saut^ed in butter, sur- 
plus butter poured off, covered with cream

bage, thoroughly washed, boiled, drained, then 
mixed with cream sauce.

boiled, the heart removed, its place filled with

sausage meat mixed together, the aperture 
covered with a slice of salt pork, tied, placed 
in a saucepan with white stock and a little 
sherry wine, cover put on, and simmered till

made to aoia and serve delicate foods; also 
made by the cook of rice, potatoes, turnips, 
etc. ; most often seen on the bill of fare as EN

CAILLES — French name for "quails;" when 
spoken the two ELLS are silent. 

CALIPEE AND CALIPASH— The first is the 
name given to the meat attached to the lower, 
and the last to the meat attached to upper shells 
of a turtle. 

CALF — Is the name given to parts of the young 
of the cow (in a culinary way) such as the head, 
feet, liver, tail, heart, brains, kidneys and 
sweetbreads; the other parts or meat is called 
veal, for recipes of which see "Veal". 

CALF'S HEAD— The head as purchased should 
be left entire with simply the hair cleaned off, 
and, if in the country towns or resorts, the cook 
has to clean it himself, plunge it into boiling 
water containing common washing soda, let it 
remain for a few minutes, then scrape it per- 
fectly clean with a fish scaler or curry-comb, 
then singe it like poultry; the head is then split 
in halves, the brains removed, washed, put to 
boil in cold water with salt and vegetables, 
scum removed as it rises, simmered till tender, 
taken up and put into a pan of cold water, and

better it will be for trade." 

CANTELOUPES— Are of different kinds in our 
markets; although the "Nutmeg" is pronounced 
the best, many have a distinct fancy for the 
"Osage" with its thick yellow fruit. In select- 
ing the nutmegs, those which have a thick 
broad cording on the rind, and with the section 
marks inclined to a yellow color, will be found 
the best fruit. To be served they are first kept 
on ice, then scrubbed or washed, split in halves 
lengthwise, pith and seeds removed, and the 
cavity filled with small broken ice; eaten by 
some with powdered sugar, by others with salt 
and pepper.

CANARD — French name for wild duck. Cane- 
ton for domestic duck or duckling. 
CANNED GOODS — The following quotation 
clipped from The Sanitarian is given for the 
reader to form his own views: 
"Under one heading we may consider several 
groups of foodstuffs, which, while different in 
composition, are alike in the form of adulteration 
which is resorted to. These groups include the 
varieties of canned vegetables, fruit butters, jel- 
lies, preserves and catsups. The forms of adul- 
terations, common to all of these, consist in the 
use of coloring matter, of imperfect vegetables or 
fruits, of other vegetables and fruits than those 
called for of preservatives. In the case of can- 
ned vegetables, there is an accidental adultera- 
tion from the ingredients of the can, such as lead 
and tin, and which may, as a rule, be attributed 
to a lack of care in canning. In all the groups 
mentioned, the adulteration practised is one of 
the most flagrant and extensive kind. Catsups 
are made of skins and cores instead of the pure 



species, the male bird differing greatly from 
the hen in that it attains to twice the size, has 
dark brown wings, and a dark greeny gold neck, 
while the hen in appearance and plumage is 
very like a prairie hen. This bird must always 
be hung for a week or so to become tender; it 
may then be cooked in all the ways of prairie 
chickens. 

CAPERS — Are a berry of a plant cultivated in 
Europe and not in America; are spoken of in 
the bible as "hyssop". They are imported 
here in five sizes: "Nonpariels", "Capotes", 
"Capuchins", "Seconds" and "Thirds", in 
bottles and in bulk, the latter way being the 
cheapest for hotel use. Capers, however, are 
often mixed by unscrupulous dealers with 
"nasturtium" berries which resemble them in 
size and appearance. The caper is only used 
for making sauces, or in garnishing. 

CAPONS — Are young fowls that have been steri- 
lized, secluded and fattened, which improves 
the delicacy and flavor of their flesh, and also 
allows them to grow to a much larger size. 
They are best in the fall of the year. The city 
of Philadelphia seems to have got the name of 
producing the best, and when placed on the 
bill of fare, no matter what part of the country,

PURfiE CRECY). 

CARVING— To carve a LOIN OF MUTTON 
OR VEAL, begin at the small end and cut 
between the ribs. A FILLET OF VEAL 
should be cut first from the top, and in a 
BREAST OF VEAL, the breast and brisket 
should first be separated, then cut across. A 
SIRLOIN OF BEEF should be placed with 
the tenderloin down, thin cut slices should be 
cut from the side next the carver, then turn 
over the roast and carve from underneath; a 
slice of both should be served. In restaurants 
the -sirloin is generally all used up in Porter- 
house steaks. A RIB ROAST should be put 
on the carving table thick end down and stand- 
ing upright, the first two ribs cut off to be used 
for well done orders, the chine removed, and 
broad level thin slices served, with gravy 
poured under. SHORT RIBS should be 
served with the bone left in. A LEG OF 
MUTTON should be carved across the middle 
of the bone first and then from the thickest 
part till the gristle is reached. A few nice 
slices can be cut from the smaller end, but it 
is usually hard and stringy. A HAM can be 



served in several ways: by cutting long delicate 
slices through the thick fat down to the bone; 
by running the point of the knife in a circle in 
the middle and cutting thin circular slices, 
thus keeping the ham moist; or, by beginning 
at the knuckle end and slicing upwards; the 
latter is the most economical. A TONGUE 
should be carved in very thin slices, its delicacy 
depending upon this; the slices from the center 
are considered the most tempting, and should 
be cut across and the slices taken from both 
sides with a portion of the fat from the root. 
In carving FISH, practice is required in order 
to prevent the flakes from breaking; the choic- 
est morsels of all large fish are near the head, 
the thin parts come next; the flavor nearest 
the bone is never equal to that on the upper 
part; a fish knife should always be used. 
FOWLS should be placed breast up, the fork 
put into the breast to steady the bird, then cut 
off the wings and legs, cut out the breast bone 
so as to leave a well browned skin over it and 
the white meat, cut off the side bones and di- 
vide what is left in two from the neck down, 
remove the second joint from the leg and wing. 
TENDERLOINS should have the tip cut off 
and then cut in medium thick slices across. 
HEARTS should be cut wedge shaped with 
some of the dressing. FOREQUARTERS 
OF LAMB should have the shoulder lifted off, 
and a slice of the shoulder and rib served to- 
gether. GOOSE should be carved lengthwise 
of the breast from the point downwards. 
DUCKLINGS should simply be cut into four 
quarters. DUCKS carved same as goose. 
PARTRIDGE and PHEASANTS same as fowls 
if large; if small partridge, split lengthwise in 
three, removing the backbone of the center cut. 
SQUABS, PLOVERS and QUAIL split length- 
wise in halves. All SMALL GAME left whole. 

CASSEROLE — French name for a saucepan. It 
is also the name of a metal or earthenware 
tureen with a flat bottom, fitted with lid and 
handles. Various entrees are cooked and 
served "en casserole", thus forming a pot roast 
or kind of braise. 

CASSOLETTE— Are small cups formed of rice 
croquette mixture either sweet or savory; when 
formed, either rolled in flour only, or else 
breaded and fried; made to hold entries, jel- 
lies, fruits, etc. 

CASSIA— Is the name of a small tree which 
yields a bark that has less aroma, but is hard 
otherwise to detect from cinnamon; it is ground 
and made into oils and extracts, and passed off 
for cinnamon generally without detection. 

CATFISH — Are of two kinds or main varieties, 
the "sea catfish" and "river catfish". Both 
are good for food, yet they are not of the same 
species. They are seldom, if ever, put on 
hotel bills of fare other than as "Fried catfish", 
"Catfish saut^", "Braised catfish with toma- 
toes", etc., eras "Catfish chowder".

CELERY — Is an aromatic plant cultivated largely 

as a flavoring vegetable and for uses of salads. 
It is generally sent to table in a raw condition, 
is the one and proper thing to eat with "canvas 
back duck". Kalamazoo, Michigan, is the 
great celery raising spot in this country. When 
the celery industry was started in Kalamazoo, 
it was not for several years that the enterpris- 
ing pioneers in this industry discovered that 
the thousands of acres of river bottom lands 
surroundmg the city were especially adapted 
in the raising of celery to the pinnacle of es- 
teem and popular favor it cow holds. Visitors 
to Kalamazoo ate it, and carried away marve- 
lous tales of its delicacy, orders to purchase 
and forward were sent back to friends and ex- 
press agents, and the industry that was destined 
to make Kalamazoo famous as the celery city 
was born. At the present time there are thous- 
ands of acres under cultivation, and celery 
finds its way from Kalamazoo to every part of 
the United States and special shipments have 
been sent by steamer to Liverpool and London. 
In raising celery the seed is firht sown during 
the winter months in specially prepared hot 
houses, of which there are acres under glass, 
the plants are transplanted, thinned out, and 
about the first of May are again transplanted 
to the fields, bemg planted in specially prepared 
trenches in double rows. There it is carefully 
looked after, cultivated and irrigated, and when 
of the proper size, the rich black soil is drawn 
up around the plants from both sides, until it 
forms a bank reaching nearly to the top of the 
leaves. About fourteen days is required for 



THE CULINARY HANDBOOK. 



the plant to acquire that silvery whiteness and 
delicate crispness so enjoyed by every lover of 
celery. The shipping season then commences, 
and celery is taken from the fields to the pack- 
ing rooms, carefully washed and tied in bunches 
of twelve heads each, packed and delivered to 
the express company for shipment. The fall 
crop, which is abundant later, is taken from 
the fields about the first of November, and is 
placed in specially constructed houses for pre- 
servation during the cold weather months. The 
season usually commences about the first of 
July and closes about February. From its 
start as the appetizer, in front of a good dinner, 
its rare beauty as a table ornament, etc., the 
rise of celery to popular appreciation was rapid. 
The use of celery and its adaptability in the 
preparation of table condiments is well seen on 
the grocers' shelves. There is canned celery 
for cooking only; chopped celery put up in such 
a manner as to retain its crispness and good 
quality for use at any time in the preparation 
of salads; celery pickles, celery mustard, celery 
salt, celery pepper, celery extracts and tonic, 
in fact everything that can be manufactured 
from it in any way. Chopped and canned 
celery are especially adapted to the wants of 
the "Chef" as they are always ready at any 
season of the year, and particularly useful are 
they at the season when good celery is not ob- 
tainable. There is also manufactured a pre- 
pared salad ready for the table, whose flavor 
and excellence is as surprising as it is delicious. 

CREAM OF CELERY— Into a good veal or 
chicken stock is put a knuckle of ham, a few 
onions, plenty of outside stalks of celery, and a 
few blades of mace; boiled till celery is soft,

served (also called puree).

CHAMPAGNE — A wine prepared from grapes; 
the best varieties are manufactured at Epernay,

Hence champagne drinkers in Europe and 
Great Britain are versed on the merits and de- 
merits of the various vintages. While in the 
United States, but very little attention has thus 
far been paid to the matter; the following clip- 
ping from the Hotel World of London, Eng- 
land, will doubtless be of interest:

a sieve, the pur^e boiled up again and seasoned; 
served with crofltons. 

CHARCOAL— One of the kitchen essentials for 
good broiling, should be kept dry in a good 
cellar; often times bought by the load, the load 
presumed to contain so many bushels; when 
happening to be delivered as many things are 
in bulk, during the steward's absence, the fol- 
lowing capacities of cribs and boxes for pota- 
toes and other root vegetables, coal, charcoal, 
etc., will be found reliable and useful:

CHARLOTTE— Is the name given to what might 
be called a shell of bread, cake, lady fingers, 
etc., cut to fit into a mold or pan, which is then 
filled with fruits, creams, custards, etc. 

CHARTREUSE— Is the name of a liqueur made 
in three colors, green, yellow and white; origi- 
nally made by the monks of a French monastery 
at Dauphine, in the Alps mountains. There 
are, however, dishes dedicated to these monks, 
called "chartreuses"; they are made of various 
rich foods, such as prairie hens, fish, partridges, 
larks, snipe, squabs, chickens, fruits, etc., en- 
closed in a mold or shell of a much more com- 
mon material, bein(7 a disguise, inasmuch as 
the monks were under severe dicipline, and 
were supposed to be very frugal. Recipes for 
chartreuses will be found under the respective 
food which demands it. 

CHASSEUR— Is the French word for "hunter"; 
it la Chasseur means hunter's style, sauce 



THE CULINARY HANDBOOK.

Chasseur, hunter's sauce, made from the pro- 
ceeds of the hunt. 

CHATEAUBRIAND— Is the name given to a 
style of cooking a tenderloin steak between two 
others of inferior cuts and then pressing the 
juice of the two outside ones over the fillet. 
But some cooks simply take a fillet steak, split, 
stuff and broil it, serve it with a Miitre D'Hotel 
butter mixed with beef glaze, and call that 
"Chateaubriand". History says the first is 
right. 

CHAUDFROID— Literally means hot-cold, and 
is applied to dishes that are prepared hot, then 
made into a form more suitable to eat cold, 
such as chaudfroid of game, fowl, partridge, 
woodcocks, larks, reedbirds, pheasants, plovers, 
quail and turkey, for recipes of which see the 
sub-heading of the articles mentioned. 

CHEESE— A most nutritious food, forming many 
excellent dishes; it is of various kinds, of which 
the following are to be found in good hotels: 
Skim, cream, full cream, cheddar, stilton, 
roquefort, camembert, brie, neufchatel, par- 
mesan, edam, gorgonzola, gruyere, port-du- 
salut, sage, sap-sago, and sometimes on the bar 
and in German clubs may be found Limburger, 
to describe which the following story will aid 
without further comment: 

LIMBDRGEK CHKE8B.— Ma sent me to pay a bill at the 
grocers last Saturday. The boss behind the counter made 
me a present of something wrapped in a piece of silver 
paper, which he told me was a piece of Limburger cheese. 
When I got outside the shop I opened the paper, and when 
I smelt what was inside I felt tired, I took it borne and put 
It In the coal shed. In the morning I went to It again. It 
was still there. Nobody had taken it. I wondered what I 
could do with it. Father and motber were getting ready to 
go to church. 1 put a piece in the back pocket of father's 
pants, and another piece In the lining of ma's mutr. I 
walked behind when we started for church. It was begin- 
ning to get warm. When we got in church, father looked 
anxious and mother looked as if something had happened- 
After the first hymn, mother told father not to sing againi 
but to keep his mouth shut, and breathe through his nose. 
After the prayer, prespiratlon stood on father's face, and 
the people in the next pew to ours got up and went out. 
After the next hymn father whispered to mother that he 
thought she had better go out and air herself. After the 
second lesson, some of the church wardens came round to 
see If there were any stray rats in the church. Some more 
people near our pew got up and went out, putting their 
handkerchiefs to their noses as they went. The parson 
said they had better close the service, and hold a meeting 
outside to discuss the sanitary condition of the church. 
Father told mother they had better go home one at a time. 
Mother told father to go the nearest way home and disinfect 
himself before she came. When they got home, they both 
went into the front room, but did not speak for some time. 
Mother spoke first, and told father to put the cat out of the 
room, as she thought it was going to be sick. It was sick 
before father could get it out. Mother then turned round, 
and noticed that the canary was dead. Mother told father 
not to sit so near to the fire, as it made matters woi:se. 
Father told mother to go and smother herself. Mother said 
she thought she was smothered already. Just then the 
servant came in. and asked If she should open the windows, 
as the room felt very close. Father went upstairs and 
changed his clothes, and had a hot bath. Mother took 
father's clothes and offered them to a tramp, who said, 
"Thanks, kind lady, tliey are a bit too high for me." 
Mother threw them over the back fence Into the canal. 
Father was summoned afterwards for poisoning the fish. 
Mother went to bed. Father asked her If she had been 
fumigated. Just then father had a note sent liim. Father 



came to wish me "Good Night" at 10 o'clock In the evening, 

with a note In one hand and a razor strop in the other. I 

got under the l>ed. The people next door thought we were 

l>eattng carpets in the bouse. I cannot sit down comfortably 

yet. 1 have given my little sister what I had left of that 

Liimbui^er chee^ie. I thought it a pity to waste it.

CHERRIES— California produces our best table 
cherries, while most all of the states produce 
the red and black sour cooking cherries. The 
following clipping from the San Francisco 
Wave will show how an immense crop is 
handled at a California ranch: "Probably 
there is no better known and certainly there 
are few larger ranches in the state of California 
than that owned by the Meek estate. It is sit- 
uated a little way outside the city of Oakland, 
and it covers a huge tract of land between San 
Lorenzo and Haywards. It is spread over 
3,300 acres of some of the finest fruit bearing 
country on the Pacific coast. A thousand 
acres of this extent is in fruit, for the most part 
cherries. The season's cherry picking goes on 
at a great rate, and a little array of pickers toil 
from tree to tree, stripping the branches like a 
swarm of locusts. The sight is picturesque, 
for the pickers come by families and live in the 
cherry orchard in a small village of tents. At 
the height of the season nearly 150 pickers are 
employed. They are of all ages and both sexes, 
as the work is of such a nature that it can be 
performed as well by women as by men; as 
well by a ten year old girl as by a grown man. 
The pickers are boarded at the expense of the 
ranch, and besides receive from 75 cents to $1 
per day, so that a wife and two or three chil- 
dren can make as much during the few weeks 
of the season as the head of the house in an 
entire year. After the picking, the cherries 
are taken over to the packing house and 
handled at once; the riper cherries are sorted 
out and put upon the local markets, while the 
more backward are shipped East. The force 
of packers can dispose of 420 boxes per day. 
Two thousand boxes go to the carload, and 
must be hurried to their destination as speedily 
as possible, for there is no fruit that loses its 
flavor quicker by overkeeping than the cherry. 
For the same reason the boxes must be rapidly 
marketed, for they will not keep many hours 
in the heat of an Eastern summer. There are 
plenty of diCBculties in the way of getting the 
California cherry upon the tables of the Eastern 
consumer, but with ordinary care and a fair 
season the prices obtainable are not bad. In

CHICORY— A plant, the leaves of which are used 
for salads. The root is ground and used to mix 
with coffee, giving it a sweetish taste and dark 
color. Chicory should be discarded from coffee. 
Eminent physicians claim it has a debilitating 
effect, and a tendency to excite looseness of the 
bowels. Stewards who buy cheap ground coffee 
will invariably find it adulterated with chicory, 
and the chicory adulterated with Venitian red, 
acorns, beans, peas, coffee husks, rye, parsnips, 
damaged wheat, dried coffee grounds, sawdust, 
bark, logwood dust, etc. MORAL: do not 
handle it at all, buy whole coffee and see it 
ground yourselves.

nificant of the different garnitures that are 
placed in the soup or plate before being served, 
or else the flavor of the principal meat of which 
the consomm^ was made. The ingredients for 
a good general every day consomme is here 
given. 
CONSOMM6 INGREDIENTS- To make five 
gallons (which quantity should serve loo guests) 
take fifteen pounds of LEAN beef trimmings, 
six medium sized peeled carrots, same of 
onions, twelve leeks, two heads of celery, a

that it will be distinct from the ordinary flavor of

CORN — A most succulent and nutritious vege- 
table. In its green state it is generally boiled 

I for about twenty minutes in boiling water con- 

i taining milk and salt, and is served on the cob. 
The dried corn or maize, (MAIS in French,) is 
ground coarse or fine for making the following 
dishes. 

CORN MEAL MUSH— One gallon of water, one 
ounce each of salt and butter, The seasoned 
water is brought to the boil, into which is then 
strewn and beaten one and a quarter pounds of 
corn meal; when boiled up again, it should be 
removed to the back of the range where it must 
simmer for three hours with a cover on; served 
with cream or milk and sugar. 

FRIED CORN MUSH — A popular breakfast 
dish. The mush of the preceding when cooked 
is poured into a buttered pan, smoothed, the top 
then brushed with melted butter to prevent a 
hard skin forming, allowed to become cold, cut in 
blocks or slices, fried plain in butter, or breaded 
and fried; served with maple syrup. 

CORN BATTER CAKES— For recipe see head- 
ing of "Batters." 

CORN GEMS OR MUFFINS— One and a half 
pounds of corn meal, three quarters of a pound 
of sifted wheat flour, three teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing powder, half a cup of granulated sugar, one 
teaspoonful salt, all mixed together dry; one 
and a half pints each of water and milk, six 
beaten eggs, half a cupful of melted butter mixed 
together, the dry and wet mixtures then thor- 
oughly incorporated and poured into hot greased 
patty shells or muffin rings and baked; light and 
delicious. 

CORN BREAD, JOHNNY CAKE OR CORN 
DODGER — The preceding mixture poured into 
greased hot shallow baking pans and baked well 
done with crisp corners. 

CORN MEAL GRUEL— Well boiled corn meal 
mush two-thirds, slightly sweetened boiling milk 
one-third, mixed, then forced through a fine 
sieve or colander. 

CORN WAFFLES— The mixture above given 
for "Corn Muffins," poured into hot waffle 
irons, baked and served dusted with powdered 
sugar. 

CORN BLANC-MANGE— Equal quantities of 
white corn meal and corn starch mixed dry, 
beaten into boiling milk sweetened to taste, 
then allowed to simmer for an hour, removed, 
flavored, poured into decorated molds, turned 
out when set and cold; served with whipped 
cream, fruit syrups or stewed fruits. 

CORN MEAL OR INDIAN PUDDING— Thick 
well boiled corn meal mush allowed to partly 
cool, into which is then mixed seedless raisins, 
grated lemon rind,ginger,butter,a little molasses 
beaten with a very little baking soda, beaten 
eggs, then baked and served with a fruit syrup 
sauce. 

POLENTA— The Italian name for our corn meal 



mush; they also make a polenta from chestnut 
flour. 

HULLED CORN— Dried white corn soaked in 
weak lye for two days is then well washed, 
boiled tender and served plain with milk. In 
the larger cities there are people who prepare 
it and sell it ready for boiling. 

TORTILLAS, A CORN CAKE MADE BY THE 
MEXICANS— The tortilla is typical of old Mex- 
ico, and is encountered wherever the influence 
of the cactus republic has reached. It was 
found as the main article of food among the 
ancient Aztecs at the time of the Spanish con- 
quests, more than three and a half centuries ago; 
and the little hand ground and palm-fashioned 
corn cake has well held its own down through 
the ages, being today as popular and in as gen- 
eral use as ever. Shelled corn intended for this 
use is first soaked over night in lime water until 
the outer husk of the kernels is loose enough to 
be removed by being rolled between the hands, 
and is then ready for grinding. This is done 
by the Mexican women of the lower classes, 
who often work in the doorways of their homes, 
bending over the historic stone hand mill, called 
in Mexico a MAT ATE. The mill is simply a 
rough slab of stone supported by four stocky 
legs and is made of bolcanic tufa, the coarse 
grain of which is best adapted for the grinding 
of the corn, beans, chilli seeds, cheese or what- 
ever it may be desired to finely pulverize. The 
stone mill is an indispensable item in the culin- 
ary outfit of the tropical home. The accompany- 
ing handpiece, looking like a rude rolling pin, is 
also of stone, and is briskly worked up and down 
the incline of the rude stone table by the woman 
as she bends to her work with a steady swing of 
body, shoulders and arms. It is claimed that 
the flour for the tortillas can be perfectly 
milled only by their ancient methods, and when 
one sees the result of the grinding he is ready 
to admit that possibly they are right. As the 
moist windrows of the meal roll off the grinding 
board it is caught in a basin and is then ready 
for being formed into cakes for baking. When 
ready to bake a woman takes a small lump of 
the heavy mixture and lays it in the palm of her 
hand; then with the other palm, she rolls it into 
a ball and begins to quickly pat it in to the de- 
sired thinness, deftly spreading the fingers to 
allow it to enlarge its size, and changing it from 
hand to hand until it is only an eighth of an inch 
in thickness and generally about six inches in 
diameter, although sometimes as large as a din- 
ner plate. The plastic cakes are tossed, one 
after another, as completed, upon the stove 
called a Brasero, and as fast as delicately 
browned and turned they are placed in a steam- 
ing heap and enveloped in a cloth to keep them 
warm. 

CORN FRITTERS — Canned corn, or cooked 
corn cut off the cob, pounded, mixed with a little

turned round its under part, the female has a 
broad brownish, feathery tail. The centre of 
the body is filled with its liver, which is a soft 
yellow substance. The meat used is obtained 
from the inner top of the back, and the claws. 
Crab meat is tasty but comparatively poor in 
nutriment and very hard to digest. There is one 
firm in this country " McMenamin of Hamp- 
ton, Virginia," who for years past have made 
a specialcy of putting up fresh cooked crab meat 
in cans, supplying with each can a sufficient

CURING — By a safe and simple method applica-

cellar temperature should not exceed 50 degrees 
F. Bacon is cured by simply rubbing the sides 
with powdered salt to which has been added a 
little saltpetre, then placing on the cellar floor; 
they are then covered with salt to which has 
been added 5 per cent, of saltpetre, and al- 
lowed to lie for a week. The salt is then re- 
moved, 'and the sides turned, rubbed again with 
salt, saltpetre and a little sugar, and allowed to 
lie covered with a fresh quantity of salt and 
saltpetre for another week; the salt is then all 
removed, and the sides are either hung up to 
dry, or allowed to lie in the cellar for another 
week, after which the bacon is ready in the 
"green state" ; or it may then be smoked. 
The best smoking materials are oak dust, oak 
chips, peat, wheat straw, ash dust, "or chips of 
other hard woods; the two of greatest value

ordinary hotel, restaurant and club patronage. 
[Inexperienced hotel butchers have spoiled 
much meat through their brine, by using the egg 
test for strength, the test being that when the 
brine will float an egg it is just right. If he 
used a potato the same size as an egg he would 
be more sure, for a new laid egg will sink to the 
bottom of a brine and stay there; while a bad 
egg will float and every day's age to the egg 
from the newly laid brings it more to the sur- 
face of the same strength of brine. MORAL: 
weigh and measure your salt 
water] (see heading of brine).

GALANTINE — A name applied to fowl, some 
game, fish and meat that may be boned, stuffed, 
boiled, braised or roasted, then pressed and cut 
into slices for service when cold, either plain 
or filled into molds with aspic jelly and decor- 
ated. 

GALANTINE OF TURKEY OR CHICKEN— 
Two birds, the larger one to be singed, the 
smaller skinned, the birds' skin split down the 
back from the head to tail, the carcass re- 
moved without further breaking the skin; the 
large one laid out flat, skin downwards, sea- 
soned with salt, pepper and powdered mixed 
herbs; the under filiets of the breast to be filled 
into the space which the breastbone occupied, 
the wing and Ipg meat drawn inwards and the 
sinews removed, the whole then spread with a 
force or sausage meat; two strips each of cooked 



tongue and fat salt pork arranged alternately 
down the centre, also some slices of truffles if 
at hand; the meat of the smaller bird then laid 
over the stuffing, the white meat covering the 
dark of the other bird, so that when cut, light 
and dark meat is served to each portion; the 
skin of the large bird is then drawn together 
and sewn closely, placed into a cloth which is 
again sewn and tied at the ends like a roly poly 
pudding, plunged into boiling seasoned white 
stock and simmered till done; taken up and 
while still hot, pressed into a mold with screw 
pressure or weight on top; when set and cold, 
the cloth removed, the bird wiped with a hot 
cloth to remove all grease and stains, it is then 
sliced for the table. If the birds are both 
young and juicy, instead of being boiled they 
may be braised or roasted (of course without 
being tied in a cloth), when done, taken up, 
pressed, trimmed and glazed. 

GALANTINES are however generally served 
with aspic jelly, and the nicest way is to take 
the birds when pressed, wipe and trim, cut in- 
to even slices; galantine molds lined with aspic 
jelly, then decorated with cooked peas, mac^- 
doines, fancy shapes of white of eggs, beet, car- 
rot and truffles, these decorations again coa ted 
with aspic to keep them in position, the slices 
of bird then laid into the mold EDGES DOWN- 
WARDS not laid flat; limpid aspic run between 
each slice; when the mold is full, set, turned 
out, decorated and sent to table. I have seen 
galantines served at banquets where the slices 
of meat have been laid flat in the mold, with 
the result that the waiters could not procure a 
decent slice to serve; had the edges been placed 
downwards, the waiter or serving man would 
have been able to move each slice with the jelly 
adhering simply by the aid of a fork. 

GAME — Name applied in a culinary sense to 
birds and animals fit foi table use that are 
hunted by sportsmen, the animals and birds 
not being domesticated; these embrace wood- 
cock, quail, snipe, partridge, wild ducks, geese 
and brant, prairie chickens, grouse, pheasant, 
reed birds, rail sora, ortolans, rice birds, sage 
hens, wheat ears, larks, capercailzie, plover, 
etc., squirrels, hares, venison, moose, caribou, 
black bear, elk, antelope, mountain sheep and 
goat; recipes will be found under each respec- 
tive heading. 

GARDEN PARTIES— Country club stewards 
and caterers are often called upon to prepare 
for and superintend garden parties, and as a 
rule the meal is served out of doors, under a 
marquee. When the steward or caterer has 
several through the summer season, invarably 
the same guests are to be found, he must there- 
fore rack his brains to continually change the 
card. Solid food is NOT REQUIRED. The 
refreshments should be tea and coffee, various 



THE CULINARY HANDBOOK. 



kinds of cups, delicate sandwiches of minced 
and creamed meat and fish, individual cakes, 
rolled bread and butter, ices, fruit; strawberries 
and cream are usually served from large silver 
bowls. The bufifet should be well supplied with 
canapes, bouch^es, timbales, darioles, individ- 
ual galantines made in fancy gem pans — all 
things to be of an individual form as far as pos- 
sible. Whatever wines are used should be of

heavy and heating. 

GARFISH — Name of a fish with an elongated

GARLIC — Name of a podded or cloved form of 
onion of very strong taste and flavor, always to

the word clove, signifies one of the sections. 

tSARNISHES — Name given to mixture of small 
tasty foods in sauce, used as a garnish and 
appropriate sauce to the main article served. 
Unhappily there are so many garnishes, that 
the average cook has not the brain to retain but 
a limited number, and not one cook in a hun- 
dred could sit down and write the component 
parts of twenty garnitures right off the reel. It 
is the garnishes that stupefy the guests and 
make them order plain roast turkey; that cov- 
ers the "bills of fare" with worse than mongrel 
French; that spoils many a good dish because 
the garnish used is not appropriate to the food 
served; that makes the country hotel keeper ask 
the cook what he wants this and that for; that 
makes the guest when he looks at the bill of 
fare exclaim: What in thunder is k la Montmor- 
ency! k la this and k la that. The following 
garnishes are the most principal in use, are 
put in a simple way to memorize, not only their 
ingredients; but that most important point that 
up to date no cook book has ever attempted to 
show. THE DISHES THAT THE GARN-

The California lemons are very good ones, and 
only experts can tell them from the Mediter- 
ranean crop. For culinary purposes the lemons 
of Sicily, i. e. from Messina and Palermo, are 
to be preferred as they possess a much better 
flavor. A box of lemons averages about 300 
each. From 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 boxes are 
sold in a year here. It is predicted that the 
California crop will soon average 1,000,000 
boxes. It will be interesting to note whether 
they will drive out any or all of the foreign 
lemons. They are used by the catering frater-

MENU— French term for "bill of fare". Why 
should the word MENU head our American 
dinner bills? Why should the progressive Ameri- 
can ape dying France? Why should the Ameri- 
can culinary student detest the kitchen be- 
cause he cannot twist his tongue around the 
French culinary a la this and that? Is not the 
American flag dear to the American? Then 
why net the American language? Does not the 
farmer, mechanic, layman and every American 
who patronizes hotel, restaurant and club life 
know the meaning of the term "bill of fare"? 
Then why put the French word ' 'MENU" at the 
bead, and the generally mongrel Frenchy terms 
throughout the bill of fare? When in Rome do 
as the Romans do; then when in America do 
as the Americans do. Let those from France, 
or the French scholars, read the plain home- 
like American language on our bills of fare, the 



Menus in the languages of Europe. They do 
not print the Menus in France in the American 
language; then why should we print our Ameri- 
can bills of fare in French, or as is generally 
the case in half French and half American? 
For example: "Veal cutlet a la Francaise," 
or "Small patties de volaille," why not put 
Small patties of chicken"? Everyone knows 
what chicken is and will order it, but all do not 
know that volaille translated means fowl. 

One of my first thoughts in Tvriting this 
handbook -was to abstain from French terms. 
I said to myself, I WILL WRITE AN AMERI- 
CAN CULINAR Y HANDBOOK FOR AMERI- 
CANS. I have heard it frequently stated that 
the terms for the bill of fare could not be prop- 
erly represented in the American language. 
I SA Y IT CAN, and as a proof positive you 
have it here. There are no French terms used 
for the receipts of this book, and the headings 
as given are tvhat should in m^y opinion be 
placed on the bill of fare, as perfectly adequate 
in describing the dish.

MUSTARD— A yellow flour produced by finely 
griudiog the seeds of the mustard plant; prepared 
for table as a condiment by simply mixing to a 
thick cream with cold water and a taste of salt. 
The French prepare mustard for table use by 
boiling together equal quantities of tarragon 
and cider vinegars, pouring it to the mustard 
flour and when thickened, simmered a few min- 
utes, meanwhile adding a flavoring composed 
of white wine which has had soaked in it in a 
warm place for an hour or so some celery 
seeds, whole spices and a clove of crushed 
garlic, salt and a taste of sugar. 

MUSTARD AND CRESS— These are the first 
sproutings of the cress seed and the mustard 
seed, used in equal proportions mixed, after 
being thoroughly washed and drained. To 
form sandwiches between brown bread and 
butter simply sprinkled with salt, or used as a 
breakfast salad by lightly tossing with a sprink- 
ling of salt, olive oil and lemon juice. 

MUTTON— What a tremendous difference there 
is in mutton, brought about by its different 
pastures and breeds. The steward should al- 
ways buy WETHER mutton, leaving the 
EWES entirely alone, unless they are MAID- 
ENS. The best cutting sheep are from sixty 
to seventy pounds in weight. The skin should 
be dry. Leave the oily skinned ones alone as 
they will eat TOUGH. See that they are mod- 
erately lean by noting the shoulder meat show- 
ing through the skin, and also that the meat of 
the leg outwards can be seen through the skin 
extending well down towards the loin. Cheaper 
to buy the whole sheep and use all its parts 
(except the head) then to keep on buying racks, 
racks, racks. The butcher is going to cut those 
racks LONG, and you have to cut off two or 
three inches, before you can send them to the 
broiler, and the chops then come very expen- 
sive. The loin chops which are infinitely the 



take up, cut the vegetables into finger sizes; 
make a white sauce from the stock, adding 
capers and caper vinegar; serve in portions 
with the sauce at ends of dish, using the vege- 
tables as a garnish.

bone, rub with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour, roast till done with frequent basting,

and caper vinegar, or let it remain plain and 
serve with each portion some red currant jelly 
separate. 

BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON— Cut off the 
shank bone, put the leg into a brasiere with 
some fat bacon trimmings, onions, carrots, bay 
leaves, bunch of sweet herbs, whole peppers 
and allspice, moisten with mutton stock, place 
on the lid, then put the whole into a hot oven, 
cook till done and glazy, take up, then reduce

ate; or you may garnish it with glazed balls of 
carrot and turnip, also some glazed small 
onions.

ley, shallots, grated ham, little grated lemon 
rind, seasoning of salt, pepper and nutmeg, mix 
these well, then work in some forcemeat, sew 
up the openings, place the stuffed leg into a 
brasiere with carrots, turnips, celery, clove of 
crushed garlic, whole cloves and mace, moisten 
with stock, braise and glaze; when done, take 
up, and reduce the braise, strain and skim it, 
add it to a V^lout^ sauce containing capers; 
serve with a stuffed tomato at ends of dish, with 
the sauce poured around. 



best should be used with the neck chop, one of BRAISED LARDED LEG OF MUTTON- -Bone 



each, thus making the pair of chops usually 
called for, the trimmed bone of the neck one 
carrying the frill and a croquette tip stuck into 
the loin one. In cutting up the sheep, split it 
straight through the spinal column, then sep- 
arate the quarters, cut off the legs close to the 
pin bone. The loin will yield three half pound 
trimmed chump chops, and ten six ounce 
trimmed loin chops. With the forequaiter, 
lift off the shoulder, cut off the breast, then cut 
off the scrag with the first two bones of the 
rack adhering; you now have eleven neck chops 
to each quarter, or forty-eight chops to the 
sheep, two legs and two shoulders for joints,

"Noisettes de veau (nuts of veal)" 
thisldish I will quote LEON CIEUX, a Parisian 
chef: 

"NOISETTES OF LAMB. A LA MAIN- 
TENON— Take the two fillets and small fil- 
lets (filets mignons) from a saddle of lamb, take 
out the nerves, trim them, and divide each fillet 
into six parts and the small fillets into three 
parts, beat them, season with salt and pepper, 
saut6 them quickly on both sides with clear 
batter; as soon as saateM, put in a good Peri- 



gorde sauce, this stops the wasting and pre- 
vents the meat from giving up its gravy. Place 
each noisette of lamb on a crust of breadcrumb 
passed through butter and the shape of the 
noisette; arrange in a crown on the dish, cover 
each noisette with a Soflbise 'a la Bechamel. 
Powder with grated Parmesan cheese, moist- 
ened with melted butter, glazed in a hot oven; 
pour in the middle of the dish some Perigord 
sauce, put on each noisettte a fine slice of trufifle 
and serve hot, the cooking must be quick. This 
recipe is for twelve persons." 

I will here quote the author of the EPICUR- 
EAN, Charles Ranhofer. 

"NOISETTES OF MUTTON, AU MADERE 
— Cut eight chops of four ounces each from 
two racks of mutton. Remove the noix (centre 
of chop), beat them lightly, trim all to the same 
size, season with salt and pepper. Heat four 
ounces of butter in a frying pan, when it is very 
hot add to it the noix, saute them over a quick 
fire, taking care to turn them when they have 
a good color, let them cook several minutes 
more, arrange them on crofltons of bread fried in 
butter and of the same size as the noix. Dry 
out the butter from the pan, add half a gill of 
Madeira, cook it down, add a little brown sauce, 
cook it down again until it is a light sauce, 
pass through the strainer and pour on the 
noix." 

NOODLES— A stiff paste made with sifted flour 
and yolks of eggs, then rolled out very thin in 
sheets, place several sheets one on another, 
then with a sharp knife cut in strips; for soups 
or to be used for all purposes in place of mac- 
aroni; for all the recipes given for macaroni, 
noodles may be substituted; from the sheets 
may be stamped out fancy shapes for decorating 
raised pies, etc. 

NOYEAU — Name of a very fine liqueur prepared 
from the kernels of fruit stones, almonds, 
brandy, gin, flavoring extracts and syrup. 

NUTMEG— The kernel of the fruit of the nut- 
meg tree. The fruit itself is in size and shape 
that of a small pear, which on ripening, bursts, 
exposing its kernel covered with a netting; this 
netting is known as mace, the kernel itself as 
nutmeg; it is used as a flavoring to soups, 
sauces, puddings, custards, etc. The nutmegs 
from PENANG are considered of most com- 
mercial value, 
of lamb)", OATMEAL— As the word implies it is the meal 
To prepare of oats; the oat grains are skinned, dried, then 
ground in a mill and placed into commerce as 
coarse and fine oatmeal. This is then used to 
make in conjunction with wheat flour, cakes, 
biscuits, bread, gruel, drinks, mush, puddings, 
thickening soups, etc., etc. A mistake is there- 
fore made when writing "bills of fare" to say 
"oatmeal porridge" unless you use the meal; 
and seldom is the meal used. It is customary 
nowadays to use rolled oats, flaked oats, and 
the different names given by manufacturers.

such as H. O., Quaker oats, etc., which are all 
rolled and not meal. Groats is the proper name 
for the dried oat grains which are neither 
crushed or ground. 

OKRA — Name of an American vegetable chiefly 
grown in the South; of a seed pod shape like 
the long pepper. It is preserved and canned, 
this bemg generally used in making gumbo 
soups when the fresh is not obtainable. The 
fresh is trimmed at both ends, boiled in salted 
boiling water till tender, taken up and drained, 
seasoned with salt, pepper and melted butter and 
served as a vegetable, or used as a garnish, or in 
conjunction with other vegetables as a garnish. 
The Creoles like it slippery, and after trimming 
it they place it in a sautoir with just enough 
water to moisten, cover with oiled paper, place 
on the lid and stew it till tender 'and muscilag- 
inous, then it is further seasoned with olive oil, 
salt, pepper and a little minced green or red 
peppers. Okras are esteemed stewed with 
tomatoes, keeping the okras whole; also by tak- 
ing peeled raw tomatoes and okras, cutting 
them both into quarters, then stewing with 
butter, pepper and salt; also the whole okras 
trimmed, then stewed tender in a rich tomato 
sauce; also tipped at both ends, breaded and 
fried, like egg plant. 

OKRA SALAD-Okras trimmed and boiled in boil- 
ing salted water, then drained and cooled; strip- 
ped endive washed and crisp arranged on dish, 
the okras quartered and laid on top, the whole 
sprinkled with a French salad dressing contain- 
ing chopped chives. 

OLIVES— The fruit of the olive tree, picked 
green, prepared and salted, then packed into 
barrels, kegs, etc., also put up in glass jars. Our 
own California olives have been brought to such 
perfection, that they are now found to be 
superior to the imported European, French, 
Spanish and Italian. Olive oil is prepared from 
the ripe fruit. Olives are used as an appetizer, 
either plain or stoned and stuffed; as a decor- 
ative to salads, as a flavoring to sauces, as an 
addition to garnitures, etc. 

OLLA PODRIDA— One of the national dishes of 
Spain; a rich soup stew, made in the style of a 
pepper-pot. A large earthernware pot into 
which is placed tomatoes, garlic, long peppers, 
chick peas, pieces- of root vegetables, chopped 
cabbage and endive, a piece of flank of beef, a 
fowl, a piece of streaky bacon and sausages. 
The sausages are made of equal quantities of 
minced lean and fat pork, seasoned with garlic 
and red pepper; when mixed it is macerated in 
dry sherry wine for four days till it has ab- 
sorbed all it can, it is then filled into sausage 
casings, tied in links, hung till dry in a cool air. 
The contents of the pot are seasoned with salt 
and pepper, moistened with water, placed in 



medium oven and cooked till tender. It is 
served as a family dish by placing the vegetables 
at the bottom of a platter as a garnish to the 
three meats, the sausages on top of the vege. 
tables, and the broth poured over the whole. 

OMELET — Slightly beaten eggs seasoned with 
salt and a little melted butter so as to prevent 
it from sticking to the pan in cooking; see that 
the pan is free from any sticky substance on the 
inside, bottom and flange; place in a little melted 
butter, let it get hot (not burnt), pour in a ladle 
of eggs, shufile around till nearly set, then take 
the handle in the left hand, depress the pan, 
then with the right hand knock the handle near 
the pan, and the omelet will roll up from the furth- 
est end, thus forming a roll with pointed ends, 
hold to the fire for a moment and the centre 
will puff up, turn on to a platter, garnish one 
end with a sprig of crisp cress or parsley and 
send the plain omelet to the table at once. 
I HAVE SAID POUR A LADLE OF EGGS, 
BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND THAT THE 
ORDERS ARE SERVED MORE EQUAL 
BY ITS USE. HAVE A LADLE MADE 
THAT WILL HOLD EQUAL TO THREE 
LIGHTLY BEATEN EGGS. ONE LADLE- 
FUL WILL BE FOUND THE RIGHT 
QUANTITY PER PERSON.

quante sauce). Cut the bacon into small dice,

fiber, 14 2756 of nitrogen free extract, 49 2956 of 
fat, 4.67^ of nitrogen. * * * In describing the 
uses of peanuts it is scarcely necessary to more 
than jrefer to that use which fully three- fourths 
of the American raised crop is devoted. The 
nut is sorted in the factory into four grades, 
the first, second and third being sold to vendors 
of the roasted peanut, either directly or through 
jobbing houses. The fourth grade, after pass- 
ing through a sheller, is sold to confectioners, 
to be used in the making of "burnt almonds", 
peanut candy and cheaper grades of chocolates. 
The extent of the use of the peanuts by the 
American people will be more fully appreciated 
when it is remembered that they use 4,000,000 
bushels of nuts yearly (at a cost to the con- 
sumers of $10,000,000) which do not form a 
part of the regular articles of food, but are 
eaten at odd times.

PICALLILI— Cut the following vegetables rather 
fine, crush the garlic, then add, pack all into 
stone crocks and cover with slightly salted 
water, and stand in a cool place for one day 
and night, then drain on sieve and press with 
cloths till dry; then place back into the crocks, 
cover with the boiling vinegar and spices, her- 
metically seal on the crock covers while con- 
tents are at boiling heat — loo small cucumbers, 
3 small white cabbages, i8 small heads of cel- 
ery, 6 medium cauliflowers, 6 quarts of string- 
less beans, 9 each of medium sized green and 
red peppers, 4 cloves of garlic, 6 ozs. of mus- 
tard seed, 2 level teaspoonfuls each of ground 
allspice, mace and ginger, 2 heaping teaspoon- 



fuls of ground black pepper, enough cider vine- 
gar to well cover. 

PICKLES — When making any pickles from the 
receipts given under their respective headings, 
always use the best cider vinegar, scald to boil- 
ing point but do not let it boil, prepare always 
in either granite or porcelain lined kettles, use 
wooden spoons or paddles. A piece of horse- 
radish root in the jars will prevent the vinegar 
from becoming moldy. They should always be 
kept in stone or glass, and in a dry dark place. 

PICKLE— Aromatic salt pickle (German)— Take 
seven and half gallons of water, one pound of 
Indian cane sugar, half pound of pulverized 
cleaned saltpetre, three ounces of coriander 
seeds, half a dozen bay leaves, three cloves of 
garlic. Boil all for five minutes, let it cool, 
strain into brine tub through a fine strainer, 
throw away the refuse. This brine will keep 
all SUMMER, and can be used for every kind 
of meat. All meat from this pickle will have a 
fine red color and a pleasant taste. 

PICKLE PUMPS— There is perhaps no process 
so important in the curing of meat as pumping. 
Meat is liable to very quick decomposition un- 
less it is immediately brought in contact with a 
preservative of some kind, such as salt, borax, 
etc. In ordinary course if these preservatives 
were laid on the surface of the meat, they 
would mingle with the meat juices, dissolve 
and percolate slowly through the tissues; but 
this process is slow and under many conditions 
of temperature, dangerous. Hence the neces- 
sity of an appliance which brings the preserva- 
atives at once into operation. The salt brine 
or pickle is filtered so that it runs clear, and is 
then injected by the pickle pump into the meat 
to be cured. 

PICKLING BEEF AND HAMS— To 100 pounds 
of beef or hams, use 7 pounds of rock salt, 5 
pounds of brown sugar, 2 ounces of saltpetre, 
half an ounce of salaratus, mix together and 
boil in four gallons of water, skim while boil- 
ing and pour on to the meat hot. For hams to 
cure well, they should remain in the pickle for 
six weeks. 

PIG PRODUCTS — Under the name of fresh 
pork is comprised generally all the lean and 
fresh parts of the pig destined to be roasted or 
broiled, particularly the cutlets, the loin and 
small fillet. The loin is the fleshy part between 
the cutlets and the ham; it furnishes an excel- 
lent roast. The "filet mignon" as the French 
call it, is the long and narrow fleshy part under 
the kidney along the dorsal spine known to us 
as the pork tenderloin. It is the most delicate 
morsel of pork and weighs from half to a pound 
in weight. 

HAMS — Nearly always entire hams are salted 
(cured); sometimes they are used for cooking

after several days cnring; sometimes for smok- 
ing or preserving a longer or shorter time; 
sometimes they are boned and used for the 
manufacture of different kinds of sausages. 

SHOULDERS— These are used to make rolled 
or boned hams; sometimes they are cured and 
smoked, and are then called fore hams or Cali- 
fornia hams; most often they are used for the 
manufacture of sausages. 

CAUL — The caul is mostly used for wrapping 
around different stuffed pieces such as truffled 
feet, stuffed cutlets, flat sausages, broiled liv- 
ers, etc. 

FRESH LARD-BACK FAT-LARDING PORK 
^Fresh lard or back fat. The fat between the 
skin and the flesh is called fresh lard or simply 
lard. There are two kinds, melting fat and 
hard fat; the first, or that nearest the flesh, is 
easily known by the touch; it yields to a mod- 
erate pressure of the fingers, and is used for 
making lard. The other, or hard fat, adheres 
to the skin and is not easy to inelt; it is used 
for larding and in the preparation of a great 
number of products in the pork butchers' trade. 

KIDNEY FAT --Is the fat that covers the 
kidney and tenderloin; it is used for fine force- 
meats and in black puddings, to which it gives 
a delicate taste. From this fat also is obtained 
a very fine white lard superior to ordinary 
melted lard. 

GUT FAT— The fat that adheres to the intes- 
tines. If melted alone, lard of second quality 
is produced; more often it is melted with other 
lard so as to produce lard of ordinary quality. 

LUNGS, LIVER, HEART. KIDNEYS. BRAIN, 
SPLEEN — The lungs and liver form part of 
the ingredients of various kinds of sausages, 
liver pates, broiled and fried liver, etc. The 
heart, kidneys and brain are prepared by the 
culinary processes which are used for other 
similar pieces of butchers' meat. The spleen 
is generally used in sausages of an inferior 
quality. 

STOMACH— Comprises the small intestines, the 
coecum, the colon and the rectum. The small 
intestine is used as a casing for different kinds 
of sausages, black pudding (boudin noir) etc. 
The coecum, called also the bag or pocket, is 
used, as also the colon and the rectum and fat 
end for the packing of different sausages to 
keep, and for the making of stuffed chitterlings. 
The stomach or paunch requires long cooking, 
after which it is used in common sausages and 
chitterlings. 

rONGUE, EARS, SNOUT, FEET, HAMS AND 
TAIL — All these different pieces can be cooked 
alone, or with vegetables without any special 
preparation being necessary. Very often they 
are put for some days in a brine. The tongue, 
ears and snout are used also for head cheese, 



collared brawn, etc. The tongue can also be 
used for converting into savory tongue. 

PIGS FEET— The handling of which, so as to 
produce a profitable return requires scientific 
method and absolute cleanliness. The feet 
should be used fresh as cut from the pig. The 
front feet are always used first as they are the 
best for turning into edible delicacies, and the 
hind feet contain more bone. The toes are 
pulled off and the hair clean shaved; the feet 
should then be well washed and scraped, tak- 
ing care not to cut them, as this causes them to 
break when cooking; after cleaning, fresh water 
should be kept running on them until they are 
to be cooked. The constantly changing of the 
water removes the blood and makes them more 
inviting and whiter when cooked. 

SKIN — The skin of the pig can be easily tanned. 
It furnishes a leather superior to that of the ox. 
It forms an important element in the making 
of jellies. Skin left on salt meat preserves it 
from the ravages of insects, and from the 
effects produced by the air. 

BLOOD— The blood of the pig is very valuable 
for the manufacture of blood puddings. It is 
used in cooking to thicken sauces; and it clari- 
fies jellies and gives them a beautiful golden 
tint. 

HAIR — The hair or bristles are used extensively 
in brush making. The bristles en the back 
serve as needles for hand sewn boot and shoe 
manufacturers. 

HOOFS — Pulverized hoofs make a very rich 
manure. They are also used in the manufac- 
ture of glue and Prussian blue. 

BONES — The bones are used in the making of 
soups and jellies. After being cooked they 
may be pulverised and used for manure. 

BLADDERS— The bladders after being well 
washed, blown and dried, are used for wrapping 
round sausages, and for filling with lard, also 
for hermetically sealing pots of preserves. 

GALL — The liquid contained in the gall bladder 
is very good for taking out grease stains with- 
out taking out the color of even the most deli- 
cate stuffs. Hence the products of the pig are, 
taken together, of immense value. 

BRINE FOR HAM, PICKLES, ETC —Before 
proceeding with the subject of pork I will draw 
the "hotel butchers" attention to the subject 
of his pickling, and as in some parts of the 
country the hotel keepers raise their own pigs 
and desire their cooks to use up every part of 
it to advantage I will give the receipts of ham 
pickles. 

Many butchers prepare their brines in a way 
as simple as it is DEFECTIVE. They are con- 
tent to dissolve a certain quantity of salt and 
saltpetre in cold water. THIS BRINE DOES

NOT PRESERVE, and must not be used for 
delicate meats. 

Put into a boiler and let boil for ten minutes 
6 gallons of water, 21 pounds oi salt, 6 pounds 
of sugar, 2 pounds of saltpetre, stir well during 
cooking, then empty out the brine and all that 
remains undissolved, allow to become quite 
cold, then add a quarttr of a pound of mixed 
whole spices; rub the meat with powdered 
saltpetre and salt, place in the brine tub, pour 
over the brine. This brine is excellent and 
can be used for all kinds of meat, and notably 
for meat where special brines are not indicated. 

Boil as in the preceding 5 gallons of water, 8 
pounds of white salt, 2 pounds of gray salt, 2>^ 
pounds of sugar, lYz pounds of saltpetre; allow 
to cool, flavor with X pound of whole spices. 

Boil and cool as above 10 gallons of water, 
50 pounds of white salt, 4 pounds of gray salt, 
4^ pounds of saltpetre, 5 pounds of sugar, 
flavor with ^ pound of spices. 

In some Italian provinces an excellent brine 
is prepared, composed of iX gallons each of 
Barola wine and water, 8 pounds of white salt, 
Yz pound of gray salt, X pound of saltpetre, 
flavored with thyme, bay leaves, basil, savory, 
and juniper. 

In Westphalia the hams are pickled with a 
brine made with, 2^ gallons of water, 8 pounds 
of salt, 2 pounds of sugar, yi pound of salt- 
petre, 2 ounces of spices tied in a muslin bag. 

For Bayonne hams, the following brine is 
used, iX gallons each of good red wine and 
cold water, 8 pounds of white salt, 2 pounds of 
gray salt, 2 ounces of saltpetre, and a flavoring 
of sage, rosemary and lavender. 

There are two principal processes for salting 
meats: the wet process and the dry. Both 
have their merits, and their combined use of- 
fers advantages. THE WET PROCESS con- 
sists in steeping meats in a brine for some time, 
according to the thickness of the pieces of 
meats; it is carried out by the big packing com- 
panies, where the system of curing has reached 
a most perfect condition. THE DRY PRO- 
CESS: place the meats on the salting table, 
powder them with fine saltpetre, rub well into 
the meat, rub afterwards with gray salt (sea 
salt). Arrange them one beside the other in 
such a way that they will not get out of shape, 
then cover evenly with white salt; this opera- 
tion is renewed every two or three days until 
the salt has been well soaked into the inside of 
the flesh, a result which is obtained in from one 
to four weeks, according to the size of the 
pieces. This process is generally carried on 
by salt meat exporters. 

By the wet process the necessary salt flavor 
is obtained, inasmuch as they are immersed in 
brine more or less salted. With the dry pro- 
cess, on the contrary, the meats coming into 



immediate contact with the salt are impreg- 
nated too strongly. 

This difference in result is easily explained 
through the action of the salt. In both methods 
this condiment clears out the aqueous portions 
of the blood in the tissues and thus preserves 
the meat from taint. With dry salting it is 
pure salt which saturates the meats. In the 
wet process the brine, which acts like salt, be- 
ing a solution of it, impregnates in a much less 
degree the flesh, as it is so much weaker being 
in solution. If the wet process is used, noth- 
ing must be done until after the meats are 
thoroughly chilled, which is not often complete 
(according to temperature) before twelve to 
eighteen hours. If this precaution is neglected, 
and the warm meats were heaped into a brine 
tub, not only would they become unshapely, but 
they would become hot and ferment, the inevi- 
table consequence of which would be their cor- 
ruption and that of the brine. 

With the dry process the meats can be salted 
immediately after slaughter, which is favor- 
able to the success of the operation. In fact, 
it is known by the reason of its chemical com- 
position, meat tends to decomposition as soon 
as the animal ceases to live, and it is therefore 
apparent that the less advanced is the tainting, 
the greater is the success of the salting. 

PICKLING OF ROLLED HAMS— Choose hams 
that are not very fat, bone and trim them, 
pickle in brine for two weeks, wash in fresh 
water for an hour or so, brush the hams, beat 
with a mallet so as to make them round and 
uniform, tie with string, dry them in the air, 
then smoke them. When these hams are dry 
they can be served raw, but usually they are 
served cooked. 

FORE HAMS OR CALIFORNIA SHOULDERS 
— Trim the shoulders, cut them round, put 
through the dry process (as above) for three 
days, then through the wet process for ten 
days, take out of the brine, wash, scrub, dry, 
smoke, and finish like ordinary hams. 

PICKLING OF OX TONGUES— Cut away the 
dead flesh, the gristle, and the fat which is 
found at the root. Make on each side of the 
root slight incisions to facilitate the salting. 
Wash the tongues in running water, brushing 
them well, dry with a cloth, rub them with 
saltpetre, then with a mixture of 9 parts salt 
and I part sugar, and put them in a good brine 
for 12 days. Ox tongues, like those of pigs, 
calves and sheep, have on their thick side a 
slimy liquid, which easily taints the brine. 
This is why it is important to well wash and 
dry them before putting into the brine. 
For the same reason tongues should always be 
pickled alone in a special brine tub in which 
only the necessary quantity of brine should be 
put.

PIGS HEAD STUFFED— More often called 
"Boars Head (glazed)". Select a perfect head 
with good ears; the head must be cut off full, 
that is with two or three joints of the neck bone 
left on; carefully bone it; the head is then well 
washed in cold water to remove all blood, and 
put into a spiced pickle for six days; it is then 
well washed and stuffed tightly with pork sau- 
sage meat, a piece of rind being stitched on 
Dack of head to keep the stufiSng in. The head 
is then placed on a thin board and another 
piece placed alongside each cheek and tied in 
position to keep head in shape; the whole is 
now tied up in a cloth, and cooked gently, so as 
not to break the ears, but long enough to cook 
thoroughly; allow to cool, taking care to place 
in position, so that it cools to a good shape with 
ears erect; when cool insert glass eyes, and, if 
available, a pair of tusks, then glaze and dec- 
orate.

PLUMS — As there are so many varieties grown, 
and all good for dessert, compotes, etc., I will 
simply here append a few ways of taking care 
of them when they are to be had very cheap. 

PLUM MARMALADE— Rub the plums but do 
not pare them, cut in halves and remove the 
stones, weigh them, and allow half a pound of 
sugar to each pound of fruit. Put the fruit in- 
to a preserving kettle, add sufficient water to 
cover the bottom, cover, and bring slowly to 
the boiling point, then stir and mash the fruit 
until fine, add then the sugar and some of the 
kernels blanched and minced, boil and stir 
continually for fifteen minutes, then draw to 
one side and allow to simmer for twenty min- 
utes more; pack away in stone crocks. 

PLUM BUTTER— Select mellow fruit, peel and 
remove stones, weigh the fruit then, and to each 
pound allow three quarters of a pound of sugar, 
place the fruit in preserving kettle, heat slowly 
to boiling point, then mash till smooth, then 
rub through a fine sieve into another kettle; 
add the sugar and boil for fifteen minutes, stir- 
ring continually; pack away in small jars.

PLUM JELLY — Take common blue plums, wash 
in cold water, place in preserving kettle, adding 
two quarts of water to each bushel of fruit, 
cover the kettle and beat slowly until the fruit 
is soft and tender, then turn into flannel jelly 
bag and let drip till fruit is dry. To every pint 
of this juice allow one pound of granulated 
sugar, put the juice into preserving kettle and 
bring it quickly to the boil, add then the sugar 
and stir till dissolved, then boil rapidly till it 
jellies, about twenty-five minutes; remove scum 
as it rises; as soon as it jellies, take jelly tum- 
blers, roll them in boiling water, fill with the 
boiling liquid, stand aside for 24 hours, then 
screw on the covers. 

PLUM PUDDING— As each and every pastry 
cook has his own favorite recipe for this dish, 
which is usually associated with Christmas, I 
will simply append one that has always given 
satisfaction to the best of critics:

meal of the hotel or restaurant. They are 
rarely made of the pure meat, as when so made 
they are too rich and unpalateable. If, how- 
ever, a large proportion of the meat used be 
lean the richness will to a great extent disap-

pear. li is in all cases, however, advisable to CERVELATPOLSE OR DANISH BEEF AND 



have present some cracker meal, bread or gran- 
ulated rice, even if added only in small quanti- 
ties, as by that means only, FIRMNESS can 
be obtained. The hotel butcher or cook should 
make all the sausages used for every purpose, 
and not have them purchased from the meat pur- 
veyor. In the case of the sausages that are 
smoked, etc., and served as a relish, that part 
of it can be always done by the people from 
whom your hams are purchased for a mere 
trifle. Further, it is my very firm convic- 
tion, that, the ordinary hotel butcher knows 
but little about sausage making. He should 
know! and I shall here devote several pages of 
this book to that teaching, with the hope that 
it will enable the hotel butcher to become of 
much more value to his employer, by economy, 
and also to become a man proper to use the 
title of butcher. Butchering is not merely cut- 
ting roasts, chops, steaks, hams, bacon, and do- 
ing general "garde mange" work; it consists of 
a knowledge of what to do with meat in its 
every use, and how to utilize every particle to 
advantage, hence, as you have read so far in 
this book, I have been profuse in explanations 
of the uses of meat and how to properly take 
care of it; as the BUTCHER'S BILL is al- 
ways the heaviest one for the proprietor to 
meet for the back part of the house. 
DANISH SMOKED SAUSAGE— The following 
recipes have been obtained from the largest and 
best sausage factory of Copenhagen, Denmark. 
For this recipe, use 25 pounds each of lean 
beef and pork, 12 pounds of fat cut fine and 8 
pounds of fat cut into small dice, two and a 
half pounds of salt. 30 gram, powdered salt- 
petre, 70 gram, powdered sugar, 85 gram, 
ground white pepper. Remove all sinews, then 
chop the beef and pork together; when about 
half chopped, add the 12 pounds of fat and fin- 
ish by chopping all fine, adding the seasonings 
toward the finish; then work in thoroughly the 
8 pounds of fat cut in small dice. When well 
mixed the whole mass should be packed tightly 
(n a wooden trough for 24 hours so as to allow 
the saltpeter to effect its color and also render 
the mass more firm. The meat is then placed 
into the sausage filler, and filled into beef cas- 
ings as TIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE. The tighter 
the skin is filled, the better the sausage will be 
for cutting when dried. When the casings ate 
filled, they should be laid in a pickling tub and 
lightly covered with coarse salt, place a board 
on top and let them remain till the salt has 
turned into pickle, then lift them out and hang 
in the air until ALL moisture has run off them. 
When dry, they should be smoked in cold 
smoke until they are a rich dark brown in color. 
The sausage is then ready for eating, and will 
keep for several months. Length, about eigh- 
teen inches. 



PORK SAUSAGE— For this recipe, use 25 
pounds each of beef and pork, twelve and a 
half pounds of pork fat cut in small dice, one 
and a half pounds of salt, 30 gram, powdered 
saltpetre, 50 gram, ground white pepper, 50 
gram, powdered sugar, 13 gram, each of ground 
ginger and nutmeg. Remove all sinews, then 
chop the beef and pork together quite fine, 
adding the seasonings towards the finish, then 
add the diced fat and thoroughly mix. When * 
mixed placed into the filler and fill TIGHTLY 
into beef casings, tying into 18-inch lengths; 
hang in the air for 24 hours, then smoke in 
very warm smoke till the skins are brown; then 
boil them until the sausage is as elastic as an 
indiarubber ball and will bounce if dropped on 
the table. This is a sure proof that the saus- 
age is thoroughly cooked. When done, dry 
them and glaze the skins. Serve as in the first 
recipe, in slices, as an appetizer or Hors 
d'oeuvre. 

KNOCKPOLSE OR HARD SMOKED DANISH 
SAUSAGE — For this recipe, use 21 pounds of 
beef, 12 pounds each of veal and pork and 5 
pounds of pork fat cut into small dice, one and 
a quarter pounds of salt, 30 gram, powdered 
saltpetreris gram, ground nutmeg, 20 gram, 
each of ground cinnamon and ginger, 60 gram, 
ground white pepper, 4 garlic cloves and 4 
small shallots finely grated. First chop beef 
and veal together half fine, then add the pork 
and finish chopping till fine, adding the season- 
ings towards the finish; then thoroughly work 
in the pork fat cut in small dice. Place the 
meat in the sausage filler and fill into hog cas- 
ings, tying in six inch lengths, meat NOT to be 
filled too tightly. When filled, hang to dry for 
a day and smoke in warm smoke. Boil for eat- 
ing hot or cold. 

WEINERPOLSE OR BAVARIAN SAUSAGE— 
For this recipe, use 25 pounds of pork, 12 
pounds of veal, 12 pounds of pork fat, 20 
ounces of salt, 30 gram, powdered saltpetre, 30 
gram, ground coriander, 50 gram, powdered 
sugar, 60 gram, ground white pepper, 2 garlic 
cloves and 4 shallots grated fine. Use only the 
best meat and CAREFULLY remove all 
sinews. Mince the pork and veal together first, 
then mince the fat, then thoroughly mix all to- 
gether, adding the seasonings. Place into the 
sausage filler and fill into sheep or lamb cas- 
ings, tying into five inch links. Let them hang 
for 24 hours, then smoke in warm smoke until 
of a bright brown color; boil five to eight min- 
utes, when they are ready for the table. 

LEVERPOLSE OR LIVER SAUSAGE— For 
this recipe, use i large pig's liver, 10 pounds of 
veal (from the neck), 10 pounds of belly of 
pork, 8 pounds of pork fat, 3 pounds of salt, 40 
gram, powdered thyme, 50 gram, each of

THE CULINARY HANDBOOK. 



ground nutmeg and ginger, 60 gram, of pow- 
dered marjoram, 140 gram, ground white pep- 
per, 5 pounds of lean pork, 4 small onions in 
winter, NONE in summer, as they easily cause 
acidity. Remove sinews and gristle from the 
pork and veal, boil them and mince together. 
The fat to be cut into small dice, the liver to be 
skinned, and the thick veins removed and to be 
boiled in the boiling broth for five minutes; 
then chop it a little, add a little salt, and mince 
quite fine. Now throw the minced veal and 
pork, diced fat and liver into the mixer along 
with the five pounds of minced RAW lean pork, 
add the spices and a cupful of the fat and water 
from the broth and mix altogether thoroughly. 
Place the meat into the sausage filler and fill 
into hog casings NOT too tight, tying into 18- 
inch lengths. Then boil the sausages in boil- 
ing water 20 minutes, take up, wash them and 
lay them on a table to cool. They are then 
ready for the table, cut in slices cold. Are also 
Dsed fried in slices warm. This sausage can 
be smoked in cold smoke in winter, and keeps 
well. 

LEVERPOSTEJ.LIVERWURST OR DANISH 
LIVER SAUSAGE— 10 pounds of pigs' flare, 
3 or 4 pig's livers according to size, 4 to 5 
pounds of minced lean pork, 10 eggs, 6 to 12 
anchovies according to size. Add pepper, salt, 
nutmeg and cinnamon to season according to 
taste. Fill into beef casings, boil two hours. 
These are well liked by most people. 

BEEF SAUSAGES— A good article for the 
"help's hall". Take 20 pounds of flank of 
beef freed from skin and bones, cut it up into 
inch pieces and mix thoroughly into it 10 
ounces of salt, 4 ounces of pepper, half an 
ounce of ground nutmeg, and 2 ounces of 
rubbed sage, then mince through the machine; 
meanwhile soak 4 loaves of bread (eight pounds) 
squeeze it dry and amalgamate with the meat, 
then add DRY, three pounds of sifted cracker 
meal; then place the whole into the sausage 
filler and fill into sheep casings, link them; 
then separate the links, arrange in baking pan, 
and bake till done and brown, about 15 min- 
utes. 

BLOOD SAUSAGE— Use cheek meat, heart, 
lungs, and pork rinds in any quantity that is 
convenient. Cut the pork rinds into small 
pieces, boil in clean water until three parts 
cooked, saving the broth and the rinds. Cut 
the balance of the meat together quite fine, 
and boil it slowly with the pork rinds and 
broth, allowing the broth to cover the meat. 
Remove the fat that comes to the surface, cook 
until it is well done. Take one gallon of calf's 
or pig's fresh blood immediately after killing. 
Stir it in a vessel 10 to 15 minutes until it will 
retain its fluid condition. Then pass through 



a fine sieve to break up any lumps. Mix 15 
pounds of the cooked meat as above with one 
gallon of blood and season to taste. Pour 
through a funnel into beef middle casings, fill- 
ing three parts full, the end being tied. Tie 
the open end, and place the sausage in the 
broth and allow it to boil. The blood, in cook- 
ing, will expand and fill out the remaining part 
of the casing. Stir continually, or the blood 
will all collect in the lower side of the casing. 
When cooked, the sausage will rise to the sur- 
face, owing to the expansion of the air. Where 
ever air collects, pierce with a fork or fat will 
fill these places. When of a good appearance, 
remove and wash in clean cold water and allow 
it to remain there till cold. The sausage may 
be improved by smoking cold over a low fire of 
shavings and sawdust. A hot fire will cause it 
to sweat and spoil its appearance. 

BLOOD SAUSAGE (NORTH GERMANY)— 
Boil fat pork till not quite cooked and then cut 
it into small dice. To every 10 pounds boil 2 
pounds of well dried pork rinds, and a calf's or 
pig's lungs, or, instead of that, a corresponding 
quantity of pork trimmings. When these are 
boiled tender, put the rinds and lungs or trim- 
mings through the mincing machine, scald the 
pork dice, and add enough well beaten pig's 
blood to make the whole moderately liquid, 
then get the exact weight (reckon 12 pounds to 
the gallon). To every gallon add 6 ounces of 
salt, I ounce of white pepper, % ounce each 
of ground cloves and marjoram. Stir all well 
together and fill into casings. Boil about an 
hour and a half until no blood oozes out on the 
sausages being pricked. On coming out of the 
boiler, wash in warm water, and lay on a table 
to cool, and afterwards smoke for a few days 
in cold smoke. (To every 10 pounds of sausage 
meat, reckon about one and a half pounds of 
blood). 

BLOOD SAUSAGE (FRENCH)— Take equal 
quantities of lean and fat pork and boil it till 
tender; then cut the fat into small dice and the 
lean meat into small pieces. Meanwhile have 
some onions, leeks and shallots steamed soft, 
added to the above meat. To every 10 pounds 
of this sausage meat add 2 pounds of pig's 
blood, 5 ounces of salt, yi ounce of white pep- 
per and one tenth of an ounce each of ground 
mace and thyme. Stir all well together and fill 
into narrow hog casings. Boil until no blood 
exudes on being pricked. Then remove and 
wash in warm water, and let cool on a table. 

BOLOGNA SAUSAGE— Use lean fresh meat, 
trimmings and cheek meat. Chop together 
very fine; while chopping add spices and sea- 
soning, and from 25 to 30 ounces of salt to 
every 100 pounds of meat. To every 100 
pounds of beef add 5 pounds of pure fat, either 
fresh or salted pork. When the beef is nearly

it will rise to the top. Pepper and coriander 
are the spices used for bolognas. 

BOLOGNA SAUSAGE (ITALIAN)— Take 27 
pounds each of raw lean pork, cooked pickled 
pork and raw veal, 5 pounds of anchovies finely 
chopped together. Then add 14 pounds of raw 
fat pork cut in small dice; season with 18 
ounces of salt, 11 ounces of white pepper, 4 
ounces of ground caper, 21 ounces of peeled 
pistachio nuts cooked in wine. After carefully 
mixing the meat and spices, distribute amongst 
it six pickled and cooked tongues cut in slices. 
Then fill into beef middle casings or bungs. 
Wrap each sausage in a clean cloth, tie round 
with twine, then boil one hour, take up, lay 
them out in a cool place for 24 hours, remove 
the cloth, wipe with a warm cloth, pour over 
them either colored or uncolored fat, then dec- 
orate. 

BRUNSWICK. CERVELAT SAUSAGE— For

sinews, this will leave 15 pounds of meat; cut 
this up, put into a stone crock after first rub- 
bing into it 12 ounces of salt, i ounce of cane 
sugar, and }i an ounce of powdered saltpetre; 
put on the cover and allow to macerate for 24 
hours, then take it from the crock and mince it 
with 5 pounds of lean veal, adding during the 
mincing i ounce of white pepper, Yi of an 
ounce each of mace and ginger and one-sixth of 
an ounce of cardamons. Then fill into skins 6 
inches thick and 8 inches long, three parts full. 
To make the mosaic work use long inch square 
pieces of red cooked tongue each wrapped 
neatly with a thin shred of bacon fat. also a 
column each of blood sausage, Frankfort sau- 
sage and liver sausage, each wrapped like 
the tongue. To insert these columns, take a 
stick a little thicker than the column, dip it in- 
to cold water, push it into the sausage, with- 
draw it, then slip in the mosaics at equal dis- 
tances, then tie the sausage, hang up in smoke 
for one hour, then boil very gently for an hour 
and three-quarters, then smoke again lightly. 
[N. B. Both while smoking and simmering, 
keep the sausage in an upright position so that 
the inlaying may be kept straight] .

long (not filling very full) tying the ends with 
twine. When filled and tied, they are cooked 
in water just below the boiling point for thirty 
minutes (to give the white appearance) contin- 
ually stirring them. Care must be taken to 
prick the air places, or they will fill with fat. 
After cooling, hang for three days in the open 
air, then smoke for six days over a slow fire.

boiled pigs' livers, 7^ pounds boned and 
trimmed sardines, 15 pounds cooked veal, 7>^

LYONS SAUSAGE — (German recipe). The 
Lyons sausage (Saucisse de Lyon) was intro- 
duced into Germany in ths year 1852 by Liil 
on his return from his tour in France. Sausage 
makers throughout Germany then tried to make 
it, because of his success with it, but no one 
else succeeded. It can only be manufactured 
to keep by taking the greatest of care. When 
it is well made and well dried, it would pass for 
Cervelat sausage. It is prepared in the follow- 
ing manner: For a quantity of 40 pounds take 
25 pounds of well fed pork, 10 pounds beef from 
a young bullock, which should be chopped up 
when warm and then pounded in mortar, 5 
pounds pork fat, cut into dice the size of peas 
and then cooked for a little in boiling water, 12 
ounces salt, 2 ounces Indian cane sugar, i ounce 
powdered saltpetre. Mix the two lean meats, 
then mix the salt, saltpetre and sugar. Rub 
them into the meats, and let it stand for 48 
hours in a cool room in summer, and a warm 
room in winter. Now chop up the meat fine, 
then mix the seasonings and add them. They 
are 2 ounces white pepper, yi ounce each of 
ground white ginger and nutmeg, 2 shallots 
salted and grated. Before the pork fat is put

amongst the rest, the spices should be well 
mixed up amongst the other things and a little 
water worked into the mass. Now mix in 
lightly and quickly the pea diced pork fat. Put 
the meat into medium wide beef runners, 15 
inches long, pressing it in very tight. Now 
DRY the sausages WELL before smoking. 
When they are smoked a fine red color, put 
them at once into a saucepan, and cook for half 
an hour at a heat of 203" Fahr. When the 
sausages are cool, there are usually some 
wrinkles in the skin; this can be remedied by 
putting them in pairs into boiling water not 
more than fifteen seconds. After they are cot 1 
again, they should be smoked in cold smoke for 
eight hours; they are then ready. 

OBERLAND LIVER SAUSAGE — Take a 
shoulder of pork and remove the bones and

and the "sasters" are dried by hanging from a 
string attached to the ceiling in the kitchen. 
The Scotch sausages are usually kept for sev-

POTATOES are much improved if peeled and 
laid in cold water overnight. It saves time in 
the morning, and they are nicer and whiter in 
consequence. 

IN STEAMING POTATOES, put a cloth over 
them before placing on the steamer lid, they 
will then take less time to cook and be much 
more mealy than when steamed without the 
cloth. 

TO EXTRACT FROST FROM POTATOES— 
After paring, put them in cold water for an 



hour, boil them with a small piece of saltpetre 
and the sweet taste will be removed. 
POTATOES BAKED IN THEIR SKINS, will 
always come out more dry and mealy, if a small 
piece be cut ofiE ONE end, to allow steam to 
escape in cooking. 
POTATOES WHEN BOILING are sometimes 
allowed too much water, so that it boils over 
on to the range, producing a very disagreeable 
smell. A little baking soda thrown on to any 
burning overflow of this nature will immed- 
iately drive away all odors.

and a slice of boiled salt leg of pork, always 
handing round sticks of fine white celery.

forcemeat; trussed with the legs well into the 
body; boil it till tender with a carrot, onion, 
celery, and a salted ox tongue; serve with a

salt, pepper and butter, and served with Hol- 
landaise sauce ... Or with egg sauce, Vfelout^ 
sauce, parsley sauce . . . Also garnished with a 
slice of boiled ham and a spoonful of spinach

cold, either plain or with aspic or in a galau' 
tine. It is a favorite with ball parties, and 
other luncheon or supper gatherings. Take 
two birds, one smaller than the other. Remove 
the head, feet and wings, then split the skin 
down the spinal column; remove the flesh with- 
out breaking through the skin, and leave the 
carcass with entrails entire. Lay the birds out 
on the table skin side down. On the larger on 
place a column of pork sausage or veal forcee 
meat down the breast centre; on that, lay a- 
column of cooked tongue, and on either side of 
it a smaller column of pickled belly of cooked 
pork. Season with salt, pepper and thyme.

removed, have a galantine mold nicely decor- 
ated with aspic jelly and fancy forms of green 
peas, white and yolk of hard boiled egg, mace- 
doine of vegetables; then fill the mold with slices 
of the boned bird, placing the edges downwards 
(not one on top of the other), then fill up with 
limpid aspic.jelly, allowing the jelly to get be- 
tween each slice of turkey, so that in serving

quantity of aspic and currant jelly.

the stock to half glaze, skim, strain and serve 
with the bird. Garnish with small potato cro- 
quettes.

everybody wants a slice of the breast . . . Re- 
move the bone from the leg cuts, season them 
with salt and pepper, then stuff the opening 
with a white forcemeat in which is incorpor- 
ated minced ham, truffles and mushrooms; roll 
them into shape, sew the ends, wrap each one 
in a piece of bacon, then boil gently in white 
stock till tender; take up and cool; then remove 
the sewing; meantime reduce the stock till of a 
sauce consistency; place the legs in again, to 
reheat, then take up and roll in fresh grated 
breadcrumbs; place in a buttered pan, sprinkle

pon of the preceding recipe and fill into fancy

FRICASSEE OF TURKEY WINGS— Take the 
middle joints of the wings, pick out all the dark 
feathers, trim the edges, singe them, boil them 
very slowly with a heart of celery, salt and a 
few blades of mace; when tender take up; make 
a good white sauce from the boiling liquor, 
skim and strain it over the wings in another san- 
toir, then add some good button mushrooms cut 
into slices, bring all to the simmer and serve

TURKEY SALADS AND SOUPS ARE MADE 
THE SAME AS THE RECIPES GIVEN 
WITH CHICKEN. 

TURNIPS — A nutritious vegetable both white 
and yellow; used plain boiled or boiled and 
mashed; cut into shapes and used as a garnish; 
or stewed in a cream sauce and used either as a 
garniture or as a vegetable; they are very use- 
ful in soups. The young green turnip tops 
also make a most excellent vegetable. Young 
white turnips of an even size may be peeled, 
the inside scooped out, steamed till done, then 
used as a receptacle for green peas, etc., and 
served as a vegetable, the parts scooped out be 
ing used next day as a vegetable; also the tur 



deep sautoir half a pound of butter, three 
pounds of sliced raw ham, the meat from three 
shins of beef and three knuckles of veal, two old 
fowls, a dozen cloves, four blades of mace, a 
handful of parsley roots, a bouquet of parsley 
tied up with shallots, thyme, green onions and 
two bay leaves, a pint of Madeira wine and a 
gallon of good stock; boil this down sharply to 
a half glaze, then fill up with stock, adding the 
turtle head, fins, shell and the coarse meat, 
turnips, carrots, onions and a head of celery; 
simmer for six hours, then work in a roux to 
the consistency of thin sauce, boil and skim till 
smooth and velvety, then strain off into another 
sautoir. . . Make a pur^e of herbs by boiling 
together in a quart of consomme, one-third of 
sweet basil, and the other two-thirds of herbs 
to be used are equal quantities of savory, 
thyme and marjoram, a good handful of parsley, 
a small bunch each of spring onions and shal- 
lots, and some mushroom trimmings; boil for 
one hour, then rub all through the tamis; add 
the purfee to the soup with a pint of Madeira 
wine; some of the turtle eggs, some forcemeat 
balls made from the white turtle meat, the 
cooked green fat cut in pieces, and the juice of 
one lemon to each gallon of soup. For CLEAR 
TURTLE SOUP, proceed and finish in the 
same way, but instead of adding a roux to the 
stock, let it cool and clarify it intoaconsomm^. 
A good sherry wine may be used instead of 
Madeira. 
VANILLA — The fruit or pod of the vanilla plant; 
used as a flavoring to sauces, ices, puddings, 
blanc-manges, fritters, creams, liqueurs, souf- 
fles, eclairs, syrups, caramels, etc. 



nip can be used for a nice entree by taking VEAL ROLL WITH TONGUE— This is a de- 



white turnips all of an even size, peel them^ 
cut off a lid, scoop out the inside, fill the space 
withjninced mutton (thus using up your mut-« 
ton trimmings), replace the lid, arrange in a 
shallow sautoir, moisten with white stock and 
simmer till tender; serve with a good gravy 
poured over them. 
TURTLE— To kill it, hang it up by the hind fins, 
cut off the head and let it bleed overnight into a 
bucket; then lay it on its back, cut off the fins, 
then the under shell, remove the entrails and 
gall; save the eggs and green fat, the white 
flesh, and the red meat, and the fins. The shell 
is then sawn into pieces and boiled with the 
head to make the stock for turtle soup; the 



lightful cold dish for luncheons, suppers, etc. 
Take a large breast of veal, bone it, then place 
in the brine tub for two days; prick it and 
punch the air out if it has been blown, remove 
from brine and wipe dry, then spread thick with 
a layer of seasoned pork sausage meat; on that 
place down the centre four cooked pickled pigs 
tongues, cover them with more of the sausage 
meat, draw the sides together and sew up with 
twine, then tie it in a cloth like a roly poly 
pudding; boil for two hours in white stock, take 
up and let cool in the cloth, then remove the 
cloth, wipe with a hot cloth, glaze and serve in 
slices.

The Epicurean (Ranhofer) $7.00 

The king of cook books is "The Epicurean," by- 
Charles Ranhofer, of Delmonico's. This book is 
1,200 pages and weighs about ten pounds. It is 
the most extensive, the most complete, the most 
readable, the most attractive and the best all- 
around cook book that has ever been published. 
The first chapter is devoted to table service, with 
instruction in menu-making and the care and 
service of wines, the decoration of the table, the 
fixing of the sideboard, complete dining room 
instructions for the service of course dinners. 
French and Russian service is explained. There 
are lists of china, glass and silver, etc. ; a table 
of supplies in which the French and English 
names are given, and a market list. Then follows
