PREFACE 



TO 



THE THIRD EDITION. 



Among the multitudes of causes which concur to 
impair Health, and produce Disease, the most 
general is the improper quality of our Food : this, 
most frequently, arises from the injudicious manner 
in which it is prepared; — yet, strange, << passing 
strange,'^ this, is the only one, for which a remedy 
has not been sought; — few persons bestow half so 
much attention on the preserv^ation of their own 
Health, as they daily devote to that of their Dogs 
and Horses. 

The observations of the Guardians of Health 
respecting Regimen, &c. have formed no more than 
a Catalogue of those articles of Food, which they 
have considered most proper for particular Con- 
stitutions. 

'Some Medical writers, have " in good set terms" 
warned us against the pernicious effects of impro- 
per Diet; but — not One, has been so kind, as to

else has— and because he knew not how he could 
employ some leisure hours more beneficially for 
Mankind, — than to teach them to combine the 
«« utile''* with the " dwfce," and to increase their 
Pleasures, without impairing their Health or im- 
poverishing their Fortune, has been for many Years 
his favourite employment, and '^ The Art of invi- 
gorating AND PROLONGING LiFE BY FOOD,* &C. 

&C.'' and this Work, have insensibly become repo- 
sitories, for whatever Observations he has made, 
which he thought would make us—" Live happy, 
AND Live long ! 1 !" 

The Editor has considered the Art of Cookery, 
not merely as a mechanical operation, fit only for 
working Cooks — but as the Analeptic part of the 
Jrt of Physic.

is an Occupation neither unbecoming nor un<' 
worthy. Philosophers of the highest class: — such 
only, can comprehend its Importance, — which 
amounts to no less, than not only the enjoyment 
of the present moment^ but the more precious 
advantage, of improving and preserving Health,

and proloDgiog Lifb^ which depend, on dalj re« 
plenishing the daily waste of the human frame, with 
materials pregnant with Nutriment, and easy of 
Digestion. 

If Medicine be ranked among those Arts which 
dignify their Professors, Cookery may lay claim ta 
an equal, if not a superior distinction ; — to prevent 
Diseases, is surely a more advantageous Art to 
Mankind, than to cure them. '^ Physicians should 
be good Cooks, at least in theory." — Dr. Man- 
BEVILLB on Hypochondriasis.^ p. 316. 

The learned Dr. Arbuthnot observes in page S. 
of the preface to his Essay on Aliment^ that ^' the 
choice and measure of the materials of which our 
Bo^ is composed, — what we take daily by 
Pounds, is at least of as much importance, as what 
we take seldom, and only by Grains and 
spoonsful.**^ 

Those in whom the Organ of Taste is obtuse,-^ 
or who have been brought up in the happy habit 
of being content with humble fare, — whose Health 
is so firm, that it needs no artificial adjustment; 
who with the appetite of a Cormorant, have the 
digestion of an Ostrich, and eagerly devour what- 
ever is set before, them, without asking, any ques* 
tions about what it is, or how it has been prepared^ 
may perhaps imagine that the Editor has sometimes

been rather overmuch refining the bosiness of the 
Kitchen. 

** Where Ignorance is bliss,— 'tis Folly to be wise." 

But, as few are so fortunate, as to be trained up 
to understand how well it is worth their while td 
cultivate such habits of Spartan forbearance,— we 
cannot perform our duty in registering wholesome 
precepts, in a higher degree^ than by disarming 
Luxury of its sting, and making the refinements 
of Modern Cookery, minister not merely to sensual 
gratification, but at the same time support the 
substantial excitement of *^ mens sana, in corpore 
sano." 

Delicate and Nervous Invalids^ who have unfor- 
tunately a sensitive palate, and have been accus^ 
tomed to a luxurious variety of savoury Sauces, 
and highly seasoned Viands. — Those who from the 
infirmity of Age are become incapable of correcting 
habits, created by absurd indulgence in Youth, are 
entitled to some consideration — and for their sake, 
the Elements of Opsology are explained in the 
most intelligent manner; and I have assisted the 
Memory of young Cooks, by annexing to each Dish 
the various Sauces which usually accompany it, 
referring to their Numbers in the Work. 

Some Idle Ideots have remarked to the Autl^or^

PREFACE. XI 

that ^ there are really so maay References from 
one Receipt to another, that it is exceedingly 
troublesome indeed, they are directed sometimes to 
tarn to half a dozen Numbers" — this is quite true — 
if the Author had not adopted this plan of Re- 
ference — his Book, to be equally explicit, must 
have been ten times as big — bis object has been to 
give as much information as possible in as few- 
pages, and for as few pence as possible. 

By reducing Culinary operations to something 
like a Certainty, Invalids will no longer be en- 
tirely indebted to Chance, whether they shall re- 
cover and Live long, and comfortably — or, speedily 
Die of Starvation in the midst of Plenty. 

These Rules and orders for the Regulation of 
the business of the Kitchen, have been extremely 
beneficial to the Editor's own Health and Comfort. 
— *He hopes they will be equally so to others; — 
they will help those who enjoy Health, to preserve 
it — teach those who have delicate and irritable 
Stomachs, how to keep them in good temper — and 
with a little discretion, enable them to indulge 
occasionally, not only with impunity, but with ad- 
vantage, in all those alimentary pleasures which a 
rational Epicure* can desire. 

There is no Question more frequently asked — or

which a Medical man finds more difficulty in an- 
swering, to the satisfaction of himself and his 
Patient, than — What do you wish me to eat ? 

The most judicious choice of Aliment will avail 
nothing, unless the Culinary preparation of it be 
equally judicious. — How often is the skill of a 
pains-taking Physician counteracted by want of 
corresponding attention to the preparation of Food, 
and the poor Patient, instead of deriving Nourisli- 
m.eut, is distressed by indigestion ! 

PaUmentier, in his Code Pharmaceultquey has 
given a chapter on the preparation of Food — some 
of the following Receipts, are offered as an humble 
attempt to form a sort of Appendix to the 
Pharmacopceia, and like pharmaceutic prescrip- 
tions, they are precisely adjusted by Weight and 
Measure, The Author of a Cookery Book, first 
published in 1824, has claimed this act of Industry 
of mine as his own original invention— the only 
notice I shall take of his pretensions is to say, that

. By ordering such Receipts of the Cook's 
*'^ Oracle as appear adapted to the case, the re- 
covery of the patient and the credit of the Phy- 
sician, as far as relates to the administration of 
Aliment, — need no longer depend on the discretion 
of the Cook. — For instance: Mutton Broth (No* 



PREFACE* Xin 

490 or 664) ; Toast and Waier (,No. 46S) ; Water 
Gruel (No. 672) ; Beef Tea (No. 663) ; and Port- 
able Soup (No. 252). This concentrated Essence 
of Meat — will be found a great acquisition to the 
comfort of the Army, the Navy, the Traveller, and 
the Invalid — by dissolving half an ounce of it in 
half a pint of hot water, you have in a few minutes, 
haif a Pint of good Broth for three halfpence. 
The utility of such accurate and precise directions 
for preparing Food— is to Travellers incalculable, 
for by translating the Receipt, any person may 
prepare what is desired as perfectly as a good 
English Cook. 

He has also circumstantially detailed, the easiest, 
least expensive, and most salubrious methods of 
preparing those highly finished Soups — Sauces — 
Ragouts — and piquante relishes, which the most 
ingenious ^^ Officers of the Mouth,'^ have invented 
for the amusement of thorough bred ^* Grands 
Gourmands.^^ 

It has been his Aim, to render Food acceptable 
to the Palate, without being expensive to the Purse, 
or offensive to the Stomach — nourishing without 
being inflammatory, and savoury without being 
surfeiting, constantly endeavouring to bold the 
balance even, between the agreeable and the whble- 
some, the Epicure and the Economist. 

He has not presumed to recommend one Receipt

that has not been previously and repeatedly prdved 
in His own Kitchen — which has not been approved 
by the most accomplished Cooks, and has, more- 
over, been eaten with unanimous applause by a 
Committee of Taste, composed of some of the 
most illustrious Gastropholists of this luxurious 
Metropolis. 

The Editor has been materially assisted by Mr. 
Henry Osborne, the excellent Cook to the late 
Sir Joseph Banks: — that worthy President of the 
Royal Society, was so sensible of the importance 
of the subject the Editor was investigating, that 
He sent his .Cook to assist him in his arduous task, 
and many of the Receipts in this Edition, are much 
improved by his suggestions and corrections. See 
(No. 560.) 

TTiis is the ofnly English Cookery Book which has 
been written from the Real Experiments of a 
Housekeeper, for the benefit of Housekeepers,— 
which the reader will soon perceive, by the minute 
attention that has been employed to elucidate and 
improve the Art of Plain Cookery, — detailing 
many particulars and precautions, which may at 
first appear frivolous — but which experience will 
prove to be essential — to teach a common Cook 
how to provide, and to prepare common Food — 
so frugally, and so perfectly, that the plain every 
day Family Fare of the most Economical House- 



PREFACE. XT 

KEEPER, majj with scarcely additional expence, or 
any additional trouble — be a satisfactory Enter- 
tainment for an Epicure or an Invalid. 

By an attentive consideration of <^ THfi Rudi- 
ments OF Cookery/' and the respective Receipts^ 
the most ignorant Novice in the business of the 
Kitchen, may work with the utmost facility and 
certainty of success, and soon become a Good 
Cook. 

Will all the other Books of Cookery that ever 
were printed do this? — To give his readers an 
opportunity of applying the test of comparison, he 
has given a list of upwards of Two Hundred 
Cookery Books, which he patiently pioneered 
through before he set about recording these results 
of his own Experiments ! ! ! 

Store Sauces and many articles of Domestic 
Comfort, which are extravagantly expensive to 
purchase, and can very seldom be procured genuine. 
He has given plain directions how to prepare at 
Home — of infinitely finer .flavour, and considerably 
cheaper than they can be obtained ready-made: 
for example.

THE SEVENTH EDITION. 



Th£ whole of this Work, has, a Seventh time^ been 
carefully revised— ^but this last time I have found 
little to add, and little to alter. 

I have bestowed as much attention on each of 
the 500 Receipts — as if the whole merit of the 
Book was to be estimated, entirely, by the accuracy 
of my detail of One particular process* 

The increasing demand for << The Cook's Oracle,'' 
amounting in 1823, to the extraordinary number of 
upwards of 15,000, has been stimulus enough to 
excite any man to submit lo the most unremitting 
study; and the Editor has felt it as an imperative 
duty to exert himself to the utmost to render ^^ The 
Cook's Oracle" a faithful narrative of all that is 
known of the various subjects it professes to treat

new Receipts, — as some of them have not yet been 
proved in my own Kitchen.

INTRODUCTION. 



The following Receipts are not a mere marrowless collec- 
tion of shreds and patches, and cuttings, and pastings, — but a 
bond fide register of Practical Facts, — accumulated by a per-* 
severance not to be subdued or evaporated by the igniferous 
terrors of a Roasting Fire in the Dog-days, — in defiance of the 
odoriferous and calefacient tepeWenx^oi Rocuting, — Boilin^y^^ 
Frying, — sad Broiling; — ^luoreover, the author has submitted 
to a labour no preceding Cookery-Book-maker, perhaps, ever 
attempted to encounter, — having eaim each Receipt before 
he set it down in his book. 

They have all been heartily welcomed by a sufficiently well 
educated Palate, and a rather fastidious Stomach ;— perhaps 
this certificate of the reception of the respective preparations — 
will partly apolc^tze for the Book containing a smaller num- 
ber of them than preceding writers on this gratifying subject, 
have transcribed — ^for the amusement of *' every man's Mas- 
ter," the STOMACH.* 

Numerous as are the Receipts in former Books, they vary 
little firom each other, except in the name gi^n to them ; 
the processes of Cookery are very few, — ^I have endeavoured 
to describe each, in so plain and circumstantial a manner, as 
Ihope will be easily understood, even by the Amateur, who 
is unacquainted with the practical part of Culinary concerns. 

Old Housekeepers may think I have been tediously 
tninuteon many points which may appear trifling :— my Pre- 
decessors seem to h$ve considered the Rudiments of Cook-

tinctions^ constitute all the difference between a common 
and an elegant Table, and are not trifles to the Young 
Housekeepers, who must learn them either from the com- 
munication of others, — or blunder on lill their own slowly- 
accumulating and dear-bought experience teaches them. 

A wish to save Time^ Trouble^ and Money ^ to inexpc" 
rienced Housekeepers and Cooks^ — and to bring the enjoyments 
and indulgences of the Opulentwithin reach of the middle Ranks 
of Society, -^-wei^e my motives for publishing this book ;— 
I could accomplish it only by supposing the Reader (when 
he firsts opens it,) to be as ignorant of Cookery,— «s I was 
when I first thought of writing on the subject.* 

I have done my best to contribute to the comfort of my 
fellow-creatures; — ^by a careful attention to the directions 
herein given, the most ignorant may easily learn to prepare 
Food, not only in an agreeable and wholesome, — ^but in an 
elegant and economical manner. 

This task seems to have been left for me, and I have en- 
deavoured to collect and communicate in the dearest and 
most intelligible manner, the whole of the heretofore ab- 
struse Mysteries of the Culinary Art, which are herein, I 
hope, so plainly developed, that the most inexperienced student 
in the occult Art of Cookery, may work from my Receipts 
with the utmost facility. 

I was perfectly aware of the extreme difficulty of teaching 
those who are entirely unacquainted with the subject, and df 
explaining my ideas effectually by mere Receipts, to those 
who never shook hands with a Stewpan. 

In my anxiety to be readily understood, — I have been under 
the necessity of occasionally repeating the same directions in 
different parts of the book, blit I would rather be censured

Oar neighbours in France, are so justly famous for their 
skill in the affairs of the Kitchen, that the adage says, ^* A9 
many Frenchmen as many Cooks ;^^ surrounded as they are 
by a profusion of the most delicious Wines, and seducing 
Liqueurs offering every temptation to render drunkenness 
-delightful, yet a tippling Frenchman is a ^^raraavis,*' 

They know how, so easily, to keep Life in sufficient re* 
pair by good eating, that they require little or no screwing 
up with liquid Stimuli.— -This accounts for that ** toujours 
gaiy^ and happy equilibrium of the animal spirits which 
they enjoy with more regularity than any people : — ^their elas- 
tic Stomachs, unimpaired by Spirituous Liquors, digest vi- 
^rously, the i«od they sagaciously prepare and render easily 
assimilable, by cooking it sufficiently, — wisely contriving 
to get half the work of the Stomach done by Fire and Water, 
till— 

« The tender morBels on the palate melt, 
** And all Ite force of Cookery is felt.'' 

See Nos. 5 and 238, &c. 

The cardinal virtues of Cookery, " cleanliness, fru- 
gality, NOURISHMENT, AND. PALATEABLENSSS,'^ preside 

over each preparatipn ; for I have not presumed to insert a 
single composition, wilhout previously obtaining the *' tm- 
primatur*^ of an enlightened and indefatigable " COMMIT- 
TEE OF TASTE,'' (composed of thorough-bred GRANDS 
GOURMANDS of the first magnitude,) wiisse cordial co-opera- 
tion I cannot too hiehly praise ; and here do I most gratefully 
record the unremitting zeal they manifested during their ar- 
duous progress of proving the respective Recipes, — ^they were 
so truly philosophically and disinterestedly regardless of the 
wear and tear of teeth and stomach, that their Labour— appear- 
ed a Pleasure to them. — ^Their laudable perseverance has en- 
abled me to give the inexperienced Amateur an unerring 
Guide how to excite as mucn pleasure as possible on the Pa- 
late, and occasion as little trouble as possible to the Principal 
Viscera, and has hardly been exceeded by those determined 
spirits who lately in the Polar expedition braved the other

Every attention has been paid in directing the proportions 
of the following Compositions, not merely to make tnem in •

mach — ^nourishing without being inflammatory, and savoury 
without beins: surfeiting. 

I have written for tiiose who make Nourishment the chief 
end of Eating,* and do not desire to provoke Appetite be- 
yond the powers and necessities of Nature;— proceeding, 
however, on the purest Epicurean principles of indulging the

machs, then shut it, till the same day in tbe next month, for they nerer 
indulge themselves with food more tban twelve times in a year/'-— Sf^ 
Baron Muncha ram's TraveUf^, 188. 

Pleasing the Palate is the main end in most books of Cookery, bnt 
it is my aim to blend the toothsome voUh the vfflblesome ; for, after aU, 
however tbe hale Gourmand may at first differ from me iiT opinion, 
the latter is the chief concern ; since if he be even so entirely devoted 
to the pleasure of eatinc:, as to think of no other, still the care of bis

the knowledge of the latter seems of more importance ; it admits oer-

eouducive to Health ; but it would be more beneficial to maiii^iud if we 
could shew them that a pleasant and varied diet was equally consistent

These and other abstemious people who, having experienced the great-

that nothing but the dread ol former sufferings could have given them

Those Cynkal Slaves who are so silly as to suppose it lui- 
becoming a wise man to indulge in the common cojnforts of 
Life should be answered in the words of the French philoso- 
pher. ** Hey — ^What, do you Philosophers eat dainties ?** 
said a gay Marquess. ^^ Do you thinks ^ replied Descartes, 
** that God made good things only for Fools f** 

Every individual, who is not perfectly imbecile and void of 
understanding, is an Epicure in his own way — ^the Epicures 
in boiling of Potatoes are innumerable, the perfection of all 
enjo3rment, depends on the perfection of the faculties of the 
Mind and Body, therefore — the Temperate Man is the 
greatest Epicure — and the only true Voluptuary, 

The Pleasures of the Table, have been highly ap- 
preciated and carefully cultivated in all Countries and in all 
Ages,* — and in spite of all the Stoics, — every one will allow 
they are the first and the last we enjoy, — and those we taste 
the oftenest, — above a Thmisand times in a Year^ every Year 
0four Lives/ 

The Stomach is the mainspring of our System, — ^if it be 
not sufficiently woimd up to warm the Heart and support the 
Circulation, — ^the whole business of Life will, in proportion, 
be ineflfectively performed, — we can neiS^er Think with pre- 
cision, — WdVi with vigour,— Stf down with comfort, — or 
Sleep with tranquillity. 

There would be no difficulty in proving that it influences 
(much more than people in general imagine) all our actions : 
—the destiny of Nations has often depended upon the more 
or less laborious digestion of a Prime Minister.f — See a very 
curious anecdote in the Memoirs of Count Zinzendorff ia 
Dodsley's Annual Register for 1762. 3d edition, p. 32. 

The philosopher Pythagoras seems to have been extremely

negative, — ^and niggardly of their positive precepts — ^in the 
ratio, that it is easier to tell you not to do this, than to teach 
you how to do that. 

Our great English moralistDr. S. Johnson, his biographer 
Boswell telJs us, " was a man of very nice discernment in the 
science of Cookery," and talked of good eating with uncom- 
mon satisfaction. *' Some people," said he, '* have a foolish 
way of not minding, or pretending not to mind what they eat ; 
for my part, I mind ray Belly very studiously and very care- 
fully, and I look upon it that he who does not mind his Belly, 
will hardly mind any thing else." 

The Dr. might have said, cannot mind any thing else— ^ 
the e^iergy of our Brains is sadly dependent on the bekaviaur 
of our Bowels*— ^those who say, 'Tis no matter what we eat 
or what we drink, — may as well say, 'Tis no matter whether 
we eat, or whether we drink. 

The following Anecdotes I copy from Boswell^s Life of 
Johnson. 

Johnson, — " I could write a better Book of Cookery than 
has ever yet been written ; — it should be a book on philoso- 

Shical principles. — I would tell what is the best Butcher's 
[eat, — ^the proper seasons of different Vegetables, — and then, 
how to roast, and boil, and to compound." 

Dilli/. — ^** Mrs, Glmse's Cookery^ which is the best, was 
written by Dr. Hill." 

Johnson, — " Well, Sir— this shows how much better the 
subject of Cookery t may be treated by a Philoso, 

* " He that would have a clear Head, must ha?e a clean Stomach.'* 
^Dr.Cheynb on Healthy 8vo. 1724, p. 34. 

" It is sufficiently manifest how much aocomfortabie feelings of the 
Bowels affect the Nervous System, and how immediately and completely 
the general disorder is relieved by an alvine evacuation.''— p. S3. 

'* We cannot reasonably expect tranquillity of the Nervous System, 
whilst there is disorder of the digestive organs. As we can perceive no 
permanent source of strength, but from the digestion of our food, it be- 
comes important on this account, that we stiould attend to its quantity, 
quality, and the periods of talcing it, with a view to ensure its proper 
digestion.'*— Abbrmethy'S Sur.Obs. 8vo. 1817, p. 65. 

t *' If Science can really contribute to the happiness of mankind, it 
must be in this department ; the real comfort of the majority of men in 
this country is sought for at their own fire-side ; how desirable does it 
then beooooe to give every inducement to be at home, by directing all

'< To understand the Theory of Cookery, we must attend to the 
action of heat upon the Tarious constituents' of alimentary substances as 
applied directly and indirectly through the medium of some fluid, in the 
former way as exemplified.*' In the processes of Roasting and Boil- 
mo, the chief constituents of animal substances undergo the following 
changes — the Fibtine is corrugated, the Albumen coagulated, the Geta' 
tine and (hmazome rendered moie soluble in water, the Fat liquefied, 
and tbe Water CYaporated. 

'' If the heat exceed a certain degree, the surface becomes first brown^ 
and then scorched. In consequence of these changes, the musculer fibre 
becomes opaque, shorter, firmer, and drier; the tendons less opaque^ 
softer and gluey ; the fat is either melted out, or rendered semi-tmns- 
parent. Animal fluids become more transparent : the albumen is co- 
agulated and separated, and they dissolve gelatine and osmaxome, 

** Lastly, and what is the most important change, and the immediate 
object of all Cookery, the meat loses the vapid nauseous smell and taste 
peculiar to its raw state, and it becomes savoury and grateful. 

'* Heat applied through the intervention of boiling oil, or melted fat, 
as in Frying, produces nearly the same changes ; as tbe heat is sufficient 
to evaporate tlie water, and to induce a degree of scorching. 

" But when water is the medium through which heat is applied — as in 
Boiling, Stewing, and Baking, the effects are somewhat difl'erent, as 
the heat never exceeds 2120, which is not sufficient to commence the 
process of browning or decomposition, and the soluble constituents are 
removed, by being dissolved in the water, forming soup or broth ; or, if 
the direct contact of tbe water be prevented, tbey are dissolved in the 
juices of the meat, and separate in the form ol'Oravy.*'

Appetite." 

The peculiarities of his Constitution were as great as those 
of his Chaiacter: — Luxury and Intemperance are relative 
terms, depending on otiier circumstances than mere quantity 
and quality. Nature gave him an excellent Palate, and a 
craving Appetite, and his intense Application rendered large 
supplies of nourishment absolutely necessary to recruit his 
exhausted spirits. 

The fact is, this great Man had found out, that Animal^ 
and Intellectual Vigour^* are muck mare entirely dependent 
upon each other than is commonly understood; especially, in 
those constitutions, whose digestive and cbylopoetic organs 
are capricious aad easily put out of tune, or absorb the 
** pabulum vita*' indolently and fti perfectly, — with such, it 
is only now and then that the *^ sensorium commune'* vibrates 
with the full tone of accurately considerative, or creative 
energy. " His favourite dainties were, a 1^ of Pork boiled

sugar, or tne outside cut of a salt buttoclc of beef. Witli re-

the Flavour^ but tlie Effect that he desired" Mr. Smale's 
Account in Dr. Johnson's Journey into Wales, 1816,

Thus does the Health always, and very often the Life 
•of Invalids, and those who have weak and infirm Stomachs, 
depend upon the care and skill of the Cook. Our Fore- 
fathers were so sensible of this, that in days of Yore no man 
otf consequence thought of making a day's journey without 
taking his '< Magister Coquorum" with him.

human life;— -and as the practice of Cookery is attended 
with so many discouraging difficulties,* so many disgusting 
and disagreeable circumstances, and even dangers, we ougu 
to have some regard for those who encounter them, to procure 
us pleasure, and to reward their attention by rendering their 
situation every way as comfortable and as;reeable as we can. 
He who preaches Integrity to those in the Kitchen, (see '* AdL*

to those in the Parlour ; they are indeed the sources of each 
other. Depend upon it, '' True Self- Love and SodeU are 
thesafne;*^ ** Do as you wotdd be done by ; ** give those 
you are obliged to trust — every inducement to be honest, 
and no temptation to play tricks. 

When you consider that a good servant eatsf no more 
than a bad one, — ^how much vris^ is occasioned by pro-^ 
visions being dressed in a slovenl^and unskilful manner-^ 
and how much a good Cook (to whom the conduct of the 
Kitchen is confided) can save you by careful management-

as Philosophers assure you that Pain even is only imaginary, we may 
justly believe the same of Hunger ; and if a servant who eats no mors

has eaten three pounds, his hunger will be as fully satisfied — and the

INTRODUCTION. 



—it is certainly an amiable experiment, — ^to invite the 
Honesty and Industry of domestics, by setting them an ex- 
ample of LiberaUtj/y — at least, show them, that *' according 
to their Pains ^ will be tlmr Gains.^^ 

Avoid all approaches towards Familiarity ^ — which to a 
proverb is accompanied by Contempt^ and soon breaks the 
neck of Obedience. 

A. Lady gave us the following account of the progress of a 
Favourite : 

** The first year. She was an excellent Servant ; the Se* 
condy a kind Mistress ; the Third, an intolerable Tyrant ; at 
whose dismissal, every creature about my house rejoiced 
heartily." 

However, Servants are more likely to be praised into good 
conduct than scolded out #f bad, always commend them when 
they do right — to cherish the desire of pleasing in them, you 
must show them that you are pleased : — 

<< Be to their Faults a little blind, 
** And to their Virtues very kind." 

By such conduct, ordinary Serv^ts may be Converted 
into Good ones ;^-few are so hardened as not to feel grati* 
fed when they are kindly and liberaliy treated. 

It is a good Maxim to select Servants not younger than 
THIRTY,— 6e/brc that age, however comfortable you may 
endeavour to make them, their want of experience, and the 
Hope of something still better^ prevents their being satisfied 
with their present state. — After , they have had the benefit of 
experience, if they are tolerably comfortable, they will en- 
deavour to deserve the smiles of even a moderately kind 
master, for Fear they may change for the worse. 

Life may indeed be very fairly divided into the seasons of 
HoPB and Fear. In Youth, we hope every thing may he 
right; — in Agb, we fear every thing will be wrong. 

Do not discharge a good servant for a slight ofienc<

of the swarms of distressed Females which we daily meet in 
our streets. 

Ye, who think that to protect arid encourage Virtue is 
the best preventive from Vice, reward your Female Servants 
liberally. 

Charity should begin at home — Prevention is prefer- 
able to Cure — ^but I have no objection to see your names or- 
namenting the Lists of Subscribers to Foundling UospitaJs, 
and Female Penitentiaries.* Gentle Reader, for a definition 
of the word " Charity*' let me refer you to the 13th Chapter 
of St. Paul's First Epistle to the Connthians. 

*• To say nothing of the deleterious vapours and pestilen- 
tial exhalations of the charcoal, which soon undermine the 
health of the heartiest, the glare of a scorching fire, and the 
smoke so baneful to the eyes and the complexion, are con- 
tinual and inevitable dangers : and a Cook must live in the 
midst of them, as a soldier on the field of battle, surrounded 
by bullets, and bombs, and Congreve*s rockets ; with this 
x)nly difference, that for the first, every day is a fighting day, 
that her warfare is almost always without glory, and most 
praiseworthy achievements pass not only without reward, but 

* Much real reformation might be effected, and most grateful senrioes 
obtained, if Families which consist wholly of females, would take ser- 
vants recommended from the Magdalbn —Penitentiary — or Guar- 
dian — who seek to be restored to virtuous society. 

" Female servants who pursue an honest course — have to travel in 
their peculiar orbit, through a more powerfully resisting medium than 
perhaps any other class of people in civilized life, — they should be 
treated with something like Christian kindness — for want of this — a 
fault which might at the time have been easily amended — has become 
the source of interminable sorrow.'* 

" By the clemency and benevolent interference of two mistresses ' 
known to the writer, two servants have become happy wives, who, had 
they been in some situations, would have been literally Outcasts.'^ 

Almost laudable Society for the Encodraoememt of Female

frequently without thanks — for the most consummate cook 
is, alas ! seldom noticed by the master, or heard of by the 
guests ; who, while they are eagerly devouring his Turtle, 
and drinking his wine, care very little who dressed the one, 
or sent the other." — Mmanach des Churmands* 

This observation applies especially to the Second Cook, 
or first Kitchen Maid, in lai^e families, who have by far the 
hardest place in the house, and are worse paid, and truly 
verify the old adage, *' the more work the less wages,** If 
there is anything right the cook has the praise — when there 
is any thing wrong, as surely the Kitchen Maid has the blame. 
Be it known, then, to honest John Bull, that this humble 
domestic is expected by the Cook to take the entire manage- 
ment of all Roasts, Boils, Fish, and Vegetables — i. e. 
the principal part of an Englishman's (jtinner. 

The Master, who wishes, to enjoy the rare luxury of a 
table regularly well served in the best style, must treat 
his Cook as his friend — ^watch over her health* with the 



*■ Tbe greatest care should be taken by the man of fashion, that his 
Cook's health be preserved : one hundredth part of the attention usually 
bestowed on his dog, or his horse, M'ill suffice to regulate her animal 
.system. 

'' Cleanliness, and a proper ventilation to carry off smoke and steam, 
should be particularly attended to in the construction of a kitchen ; the 
|rrand scene of action, the fire-place, should be placed where it may re- 
ceive plenty of light ; hitherto the contrary has prevailed, and the poor 
Cook is continually basted with her own perspiration.'*— A, C. Jun* 

** Tbe most experienced artists in Cookery cannot be certain of their 
work without tasting— they must be incessantly tasting. Tbe spoon of a 
good Cook is continually passing from the stewpan to his tongue ; nothing 
but fi'equent .tasting his Sauces, Ragouts, <fec. can discover to him what 
progress they have made, or enable him to season a Soup with any cer- 
tainty of success; his Palate, therefore, must be in the liighest state of 
excitability, that the least fault may be perceived in an instant. i 

*' But, alas ! the constant empyreumatio fumes of tbe stoves, the ne- 
cessity of frequent drinking, and often of bad beer, to moisten a parched 
throat ; in short, every thing around him conspires quickly to vitiate the 
organs of taste ; the palate becomes blunted, its quickness of feeling 
and delicacy, on which the sensibility of the organs of taste depends, 
grows daily more obtuse, and in a short time the gustatory nerve be- 
cerne? quite unexcitable.

Besides understanding the management of the Spit — ^the 
Stewpan, and the Rolling Pin, a Complete Cook must 
know how to go to Market, write legibly, and keep Accounts 
accurately. 

In well regulated Private Families the most convenient 
custom seems to ba, that the Cook keep a house-book, con- 
taining an account of the miscellaneous article she purchases ; 
and the Butcher's, Baker's, Butterman's, Green -grocer's. 
Fishmonger's, Milkman's, and Washing Bills are brought 
in every Monday ; these it is the duty of tha Cook to exa- 
mine, before she presents them to her employer every Tues- 
day morning to be discharged. 

The advantage of paying such bills weekly is incalculable ; 
among others— the constant check it aflPords against any ex- 
cess beyond the sum allotted for defraying them, and the op- 
portunity it gives of correcting increase of expense in one 
week by a prudent retrenchment in the next. ♦* If you would

at success, if he can prevail on his master to observe the same rSgime 
which he orders for his Cook, or, instead of endeavouring to awaken an 
idle Appetite, by reading the Index to a Cookery Book, or an add!*

. It is an excellent plan to have a table of rules for regulat- 
ing the ordinary ex pences of the Family, in order to check 
any innovation or excess which otherwise roight be intro- 
duced unawares, and derange the proposed distribution of 
the annual revenue. 

To understand the Economy of Household Affairs is not 
only essential to a Woman's proper and pleasant performance 
of the duties of a Wife and a Mother, but is indispensable to 
the Comfort, Respectabilitv, and general Welfare of all Fa-t 
milies — ^whatever oe their Circumstances. 

The Editor has employed some leisure hours in collecting 
Practical Hints for Instructing Inexperienced Housekeepers in 
the useful 

Art of Providing Comfortably for a Family ; 
which is displayed so plainly and so particularly, that a Young 
Lady may learn the delectable Arcana of Domestic Affairs, in 
as little time as is usually devoted to directing the position 
of her Hands on a Piano-forte^ or of her Feet in a QuadrxUe 
—this will enable her to make the Cage of Matrimony as 
comfortable as the Net of Courtship was charming. For this 
purpose he has contrived 

A Housekeeper's Ledger, 

A Plain and Easy Plan of Keeping Accurate Accounts of 
the Expenses of Housekeeping, which with only

will enable you to balance all such Accounts with the utmost

It is almost impossible for a Cook in a large Family, to 
attend to the business of the Kitchen with any certainty of 
perfection if employed in other household concerns. It is a 
service of such importance, and so difficult to perform even

tolerably well, that it is sufficient to engross the entire atten- 
tion of one person. 

" If we take a review of the Qualifications which are indiS" 
pensable in that highly estimable domestic^ a Good Cook, 
we shall find that very few deserve that name."* 

*« The majority of those who set up for Professors of this 
Art are of mean ability, selfish, and pilfering everything 
they can ; others are indolent and insolent. Those who 
really understand their Business, (which are by far the 
smallest number,) are too often either ridiculously saucy, or 
insatiably thirsty ; in a word, a good subject of this class is a . 
rara avis indeed !" 

" God sends Meat," — ^who sends Cooks ?t the proverb has 
long saved us the trouble of guessing. Vide Almanach des 
Gourmandsy p. 83. 

Of what value then is not this book ? — which will render 
every person of common sense a good Cook in as little time 
as they can read it through attentively. 

If the Masters and Mistresses of Families will sometimes 
condescend to make an amusement of this Art, they will es- 
cape numberless disappointments, &c. which those who will 
not will occasionally inevitably suffer, to the detriment of 
both their Health and their Fortune. 

* *' She must be qoick and strong of sight ; her hearing most acute, 
that she may be sensible when the contents of her vessels babble, al- 
though they be closely covered, and that she may be alarmed before 
the pot boils over ; her auditory nerve ought to discriminate (when se- 
veial saucepans are in operation at the same time) the simmering of one« 
the ebullition of another, and the full-toned wabbling of a third. 

" It is imperiously requisite that her organ of smell be highly sus- 
ceptible of the various effluvia, that her nose may distinguish the per- 
fection of aromatic ingredients, and that in animal substances it shall 
evince a suspicious accuracy between tenderness and putrefaction; 
above all, her olfactories should be tremblmgly alive to mustiness and 
empyreuma. 

^ It is from the exquisite sensibility of her palate, that we admire and 
jadge of the Cook ; from the alliance between the olfactory and sapid 
organs it will be seen, that their perfection is indispensable."—^. C. 
Jun, 

t A facetious Gourmand suggests that the old story of '* lighting a 
Candle to the DeviP' probably arose from this adage —and was an of- 
fering presented to his Infernal Majesty, by some Epicure who waa in 
want of a Cook. 



INTRODUCTION. 19 

I did not presume to offer any observations of my own, till 
I had read aJl that I could find written on the subject, and 
submitted (with no small pains) to a patient and attentive 
consideration of every preceding work, relating to culinary 
coDcerns, that I could meet with. 

These Books vary very little from each other— except in 
the preface, they are 

** Like in all else as one Egg to another.** 

"Jb uno, disce omneSy^ cutting and pasting have been much 
oftener employed than the Pen and Ink : any one who has 
occasion to refer to two or three of them, will find the Receipts 
almost always *' verbatim et literatim ;*' equally unintelligible 
to those who are ignorant, and useless to those who are ac- 
quainted with the business of the Kitchen. 

I have perused not less than 250 of these volumes. 

During the Herculean labour of my tedious progress through 
these books, few of which affords the germ of a single idea, 
I have often wished that the authors of them had been satis- 
fied with giving us ihe results of their own practice and ex- 
perience — instead of idly perpetuating the errors, prejudices, 
and plagiarisms, of their predecessors, — the strange, and un- 
accountable, and uselessly extravagant farragos, and heteroge- 
neous compositions, which fill their pages, are combinations 
Ho rational being would ever think of either dressing or 
eating; and without ascertaining the practicability of pre- 
paring the receipts, and their fitness for food when done, 
they should never have ventured to recommend them to 
others ; — ^the reader of them will often put the same qtuBrCy 
as Jeremy^ in Congreve's comedy of " Love for Lovey"* when 
Valentine observes, ** There's a page doubled down in Epic- 
tetus, that is a feast for an Emperor." — Jer. Was Epictetus a 
real Cook, or did he only write Receipts ? 

Half of the modem Cookery books are made up with pages 
cut out of obsolete works, such as the " Choise Manual of 
^eereUy'^ the " True Gentlewoman's Delight,^' &c. of as much 
iMe, in this ^ge of refinement, as the following curious passage 
from " The Accomplished Lady's Rich Closet of Rarities^ or 



20 INTRODUCTION. v 

Ingenious Gentlewoman's Delightful Companion,"' 12mo, 
London, 1653, chapter 7, page 42 ; which I have inserted ia 
a note* to give the reader a notion of the barbarous manners 
of the 16//i century y with the addition of the Arts of the Con- 
feciioner, — the Brewer, — the Baker, — the Distiller, — the 
Gardener, — the Clearstarcher, — and the Perfumer, — ^and how 
to make Pickies,— Puft' Paste,— Butter,— Blacking, &c. — 
together with my Lady BourUifuVs sovereign remedy for an 
inward Bruise, and other ever-failing Nostrums — Dr, Killem-^ 
quick's wonder-working Essence, and fallible Elixir which: 
cures all manner of incurable maladies direc.ly minute — Mrs. 
Notable's instructions how to make soft Pomatum, that will 
soon make more hair grow upon thy Head, " than Dubbin, 
thy thill horse, hath upon his tail," and many others equally 
invaluable ! ! ! — the proper appellation for which, would be 
•* a dangerous budget of vulgar errors," concluding with a 
bundle of extracts from " the Gardener's Calendar," and 
** the Publican's Daily Companion." 

Thomas Carter, in the preface to his " City and Country 
Cook,** London, 1738, says, "What I have published, is 
almost the only book, one or two excepted, which of late 



* '' A Gentlewoman being at table, abroad or at home, most observe 
to keep her body straight, and lean not by any means with ber elbows, 
nor by ravenous gesture discover a voracious appetite ; talk not when 
you have meat in your mouth ; and do not smack like a Pig, nor veu • 
ture to eat Spoonm»at so hot that the tears stand in your Eyes, which 
is as unseemly as the Geuilewoman viho pretended to have as little a 
Stomach as she bad a Mouth, and therefore would not swallow her 
Peas by spoonsful ; but took them one by one, and cut them in two 
before she would eat them. It is very uncomely to diink so large a 
draught that your Breath is almost goue-^utid are forced to blow 
strongly to recover yourself— throwing down your liquor as into a Fttai- 
nel is an action fitter for a Juggler than a Gentlewoman; thus much for 
your Observations in genernl ; if I am defective as to particulars, your 
own prudence, discretion, and curious observations will supply." 

*' In Carving at your own TabU, distribute the best pieces first, and 
it will appear very comely and decent to use a Fork; so touch no piece 
of Meat without it"

ye^rs has come into tlie world, that has been the result of the 
au hor's own practice and experience ; for though very few 
eminent practical Cooks have ever cared to publish what 
they knew of the art, yet they have been prevailed on, for a 
small premium from a Bookseller to lend their names to per- 
formances in this art, unworthy their owning." 

Robert Mav, in the introduction to his '* Accomplished 
Cook,'* 1665, says, " To all honest and well intending persons 
of my profession, and others^ this booh cannot but be accept^ 
able^ as it plainly and profitably discovers the mystery cf the 
vhok art ; for which, thouojh I m?y be envied by some, that 
only value their private interests above posterity and the public 
gO(>d; yet, (he adds,) God and my own conscience would 
iJot permit me to bury these, my experiences, with my silver 
lairs in the grave." 

Those high and mighty Masters and Mistresses of the Ali- 
mentary Art, who call themselves " Profess*'* Cooks, are said 
to be very jealous and mysterious beings : and that if in a 
long life of laborious Stove work, they have found out a few 
useful secrets, they seldom impart to the public the fruits of 
their experience, but sooner than divulge their discoveries for 
the benefit and comfort of their fellow-creatures, these silly 
selfish beings will rather run the risk of a reprimand from 
their employers, and will sooner spoil a good Dinner, than 
suffer their fellow-servants to see liow they dress it ! ! ! 

The silly selfishness of short-sighted mortals, is never more 
extremely absurd than in their unprofitable parsimony, of 
what is of no use to them, but would be of actual value to 
others,— who in return would willingly repay them tenfold ; 
—however, I hope I may be permitted to quote in defence 
of these culinary Professors, a couple of lines of a favourite 
old song : 

" Tfyoa search the world round, each professioD, you'll find, 
" Hath some snug little secrets, which the Mysterj'* they call/' 

* ** Almost all Arts and Sciences are more or less encumbered with 
^arerromand prejudices, which avarice and i|rnorance have unfo*- 
tniat4>lj sufiicient influence to preserve, by help (or bioderao.^) of 
niysterious, undefinable, and not seldom unintelligible, technical terms 
^Aoglic^, nicknames— which, instead of enlightenina* the subject it is

My receipts are the results of experiments carefBlly 
made, and accurately and circumstantially related ; 

The Time requisite for dressing being stated. 

The Quantities of the various articles contained in each 
composition being carefully set down in Number, Weight, 
and Measure. 

The Weights are Avoirdupois ; the Measure, Lyne^s 
graduated Glass, i. e. a Wine pint divided into sixteen ounces, 
aud the Ounce into eight Drachms : — by a Wineglass is to be 
understood two ounces liquid measure ; — by a lai^e or table 
Spoonful, half an ounce ; — by a small or Tea Spoonful, a 
drachm or half a quarter of an ounce, i, e. nearly equal to 
two drachms avoirdupois. 

At Price's glass warehouse, near Exeter 'Change, in the 
StranJ, you may get measures divided into Tea and Table 
Spoons. — No Cook should be without one, who wishes to be 
regular in her business. 

This precision has never before been attempted in Cookery 
books, but I found it indispensable from the impossibility of 
guessing the quantities intended by such obscure expressions 
as have been usually employed for this purpose in former 
works : — 

For instance : a bit of this — a handful of that — a pinch of 
t'other, — do 'em over with an Egg-«-and a sprinkle of salt, — 
a dust of flour — a shake of pepper, — a squeeze of lemon^ — 

professedly pretended they were invented to illuminate, serve bat to 
shroud it in almost impenetrable obscurity ; and, in general, so extrava- 
gantly fond are the professors of an art of keeping up ail the pomp, 
circumstance, and mystery of it, and of preserving the accumulated pre- 
judices of ages past undiminished, that one might fairly suppose those 
who have bad the courage and perseverance to overcome these obstacles, 
and penetrate the veil of science, were delighted with placing difficalties 
in the way of those who may attempt to follow them, on purpose to 
deter them from the pursuit, and that they cannot bear others should 
climb the hill of knowledge by a readier road than they themselves did : 
and such is V esprit du corps, that as their predecessors supported them- 
selves by serving it out gradattm et iitiUalim, and retailing with a 
sparing hand the information they so hardly obtained, they find it oon- 
vehient to follow their example : and, willing to do as they have been 
doncS by, leave and bequeath the inheritance undiminished to those who 
may succeed them.''— r3ee p. 10. of Dr. Kitchiner on T«/e«eopef, 
12ino. 1825. printed for Whittaker, Ave Maria Lane.

or a dash of yniegar, &c. are the constant phrases ; season it 
to your Palate, (meaning the Cook's,) is another form of 
speech : now, if she has any, — it is very imlikely that it is in 
unison with that of her employers, — hy continually sipping 
piqmnte relishes, it becomes blunted and insensible, and 
loses the faculty of appreciating delicate flavours, — so that 
every thing is done at random. 

These Culinary technicals* are so very differently under- 
stood by the learned who write them, — and the unlearned 
who read them, and their '* rule of Thumb'* is so eztremely 
indefinite, that if the same dish be dressed by different 
persons, it will generally be so different, that nobody would 
imagine they had worked from the same directions, which 
will assist a person who has not served a regular apprentice- 
ship in the Kitchen, no more than reading " Robinson 
Crusoe,'* would enable a Sailor to steer safely from England 
tokdia. 

It is astonishing how cheap Cookery Books are held by 
practical Cooks : when 1 applied to an experienced artist to 
recommend me some books that would give me a notion of 
the radiments of Cookery, he replied with a smile — '* You 
may read Don Quixote^ or Peregrine Pickky they are both 
yery good books." 

Careless expressions in Cookery are the more surprising, 
«s the Confectioner is regularly attentive, in the description 
ofhis preparations, to give the exact quantities, though his 
business, compared to Cookery, is as unimportant, as the 
Ornamental is inferior to the Useful. 

' The maker of Blanc-mange, Custards, &c. and the endless 
^d useless collection of puerile playthings for the palate (of 
Rrstand Second childhood, for the Vigour of Manhood seek" 

* " In the present langniage of Cookery, there has been a woeful 
departure from the simplicity of our Ancestors, such a farrago of unap- 
yiopiiate and onmeaning terms, many corrupted from the French, others 
d^piisedfrom the Italian, some misapplied from the German, while many

But the most e3ctraordinary of all the Culinary Receipts that bave

liizald's. *' How to roast and eat a Goose alive.** « Take a GOOSB 
or a DUCK, or some such lively creature, (but a Goose is best of all 
for this purpose,) pull off all her feathers, only the bead and neck 
must be Spared ; then make a fire round about her, not too close to 
her, that the smoke do not choke her, and that the fire may not burn 
her too soon : nor too far off, that she may not escape free ; within

the circle of the fire let there be set small cups and pofs full of water/ 
wherein salt and honey are minsled ; and let there be set also chargers' 
full of sodden Apples, cut into small pieces in the dish. The Goose 
must be all larded, and basted over with butter, to m^ke her the more ' 
fit to be eaten, and may roast the better : put then fire about her, but ' 
do not make too much haste, when as you see her begin to roast ; for 
by walking about, and flying here and there, being cooped in by the' 
fire that stops her way out," the unwearied Goose is kept in ; she will 
fall to drink the water to quench her thirst and cool her heart, and all 
her body, and the Apple Sauce will make her dung and cleanse and 
empty her. And when she roasteth, and consumes inwardly, always 
vret her head and heart with a wet sponge ; and when you see her giddy' 
with running, and begin to stumble, her heart wants moisture, and she 
is roasted enough. Take her up, set her before your guests, and she 
Vill cry as you cut off any part firora her, and will be almost eaten up 
before she be dead ; it is mighty pleasant to behold ! !— See Wecker's 
Secrets of Nature, in folio, London, 1660, pp. 148, 300.*

this time in high fashion, when the Baronial Entertainments were cba- 
rpictwized by a grandeur and pompqus ceremonial, approaching nearly 
tp the magnificence of Royalty : there was sctMPceiy any Royal or

with the skin and feathers ; the beal^ and comb gilt, and the tail spread,

That the English reader may be enabled to fonn some idea of thcf - 
heterogeneous messQS with which the Roman Palate was delighted, M 
introduce the. following Receipt from j4pieius» 

" Thick Sauce for a Boiled Chicken. — Put^ the following in- ^ 
gradients into a Mortar : Aniseed, dried Mint, and Lazer Root, (similar 
to Asafoetida), cover them with vinegar ; add dates ; pour in Liquamen, * 
Oil, and a small quantity, of Mustard Seeds — reduce all to a proper 
thidcness with Port Wine warmed ; and then pour this same over your 
Chicken, which should previously be boiled in Anise-seed water.'' 

Liquamen and. Garum were synonymous terms for the same thing ; 
the former adopted in the room of the latter, about the age of Aure- - 
lian. It was a Liquid, and thus prepared : The Guts of large Fish and 
a variety of small Fish, were put into..a vessel and well salted, and ex- - 
posed to the Sun till they became putrid. A liquor was produced in a 
i!>bort time,:which.being strained off, was the Liquamen, — Vide Lister 
311 Apieiam, p. 1 6, notes. 

Essence qf Anchovy ^ as it is usually made for sale, when it has beeir' 
opened about ten days, is not much unlike the Roman Liquamen. See 
No. 433. Some suppose it was the same thing as the Russian Canuxr, • 
which is prepared from the Roe of the Sturgeon., 

The BiiACK Broth of Lacedeemon will long continue to excite the 
wonder of the Philosopher, and the disgust of the Epicure. What the 
ingredients of this sable composition were, we cannot exactly ascertain. 
Jul. Pollux says, the Lacedaemonian Black Broth was blood, thickened ' 
in a certain, way*. Dr. Lister (in Apicium) supposes it to have been 
hog*s blood ; if so,. this celebrated Spartan dish bore no very distant* 
resemblance to the blnck-puddings of our. days. It could not be a very • 
alluring mess, since a, citizen of Sybaris having tasted it, declared it 
was no longer a matter ;of astonishment with him, why the Spartans 
were so fearless of death, since any one in his senses would much rather 
die, than exist on such . execrable food. Vide Athenaeum, L. iv.c. 3. 
When Dionysius the Tyrant had tasted the Black Broth,he exclaimed - 
against it as miserable stuff; the Cook replied — << It was no wonder, 
for the sauce was wanting." " What sauce?" says Dionysius. The • 
wasweryffis,'^*' Labour. ttnd exercise, hunger and thirit, these are-- 
the sauces we. Lacedaemonians use" and they make the coarsest fare 
agreeable. Cicbro, 3 Tuscul. 



INVITATIONS TO DINNER. 



In **^ the affairs of the Mouth^* the strictest punctuality is 
indispensable ; — ^the Gastronomer ought to be as accu- 
rate an observer of Time, as the Astronomer. The least 
- 'delay produces fatal and^ irreparable Misfortunes, 

Almost all other Ceremonies and Civil Duties may be 
put oflP for several hours without much inconvenience, and 
.all may be postponed without absolute Danger. A little 
Delay, may' try the patience of those who are wailing;, but 
the act itself will be equally perfect and equally valid. — Pro- 
crastination sometimes is rather advantageous than prejudi- 
cial, r It gives time for Reflection — and may prevent our 
takin? a step which would have made us miserable for Life; 
*the delay of a Courier has prevented the conclusion of 
a Convention, the signing of which might have occasioned 
the ruin of a Nation. 

If, from Affairs the most important, we descend to our 
Pleasures and Amusements, we shall find new arguments 
in support of our assertions. The putting off of a Rendez- 
vous^ or a Ball, &c. will make them the more delightful. 
.To hope is to. enjoy, 

" Man never is, but always to be blest," 

The anticipation of Pleasure warms our imagination, and 
keeps those feehngs alive, which Possession too ofteii 
• extinguishes. 

**''Tis Expectation only makes us blest; 
" Enjoyment disappoints us at the best.'* 

Dr. Johnson has most sagaciously said : " Such is the 
state of Life, that none are happy ^ but by the anticipation of 
Charige : the change itself is nothing ; when we have made 
it, the next wish, is immediately to change again." 

However singular our assertions- may have at first ap- 
peared to those who have not considered the subject, we 
hope by this time we have made converts of our readers, and

tage of being introduced to the other Guests. He consklers 
not only what is on the Table^ but Who are around it.: his 
priiicipai inducement to leave his own Fire^side, is tlie cbarHi 
of a^eable and instructive Society, and the opportunity of 
makmg connexions, which may augment the interest and en- 
joyment of existence. 

It is the mostplecuing part of the Duty (^ the Master ef 
the Feast, (especially when the Guests are not very nume- 
rous,*) to take advantage of these moments to introduce them 
to one another, naming them individually in an audible voice, 
and adroitly laying hiM. of those ties of acquaintanceship or 
profession which may exist between them. 

This will much augment the pleasures of the Festive Boaird, 
-^jo which it is indeed as indipensablea Prelude, as an Over- 
ture is to an Opera: and the Host will thus acquire an addi- 
tional claim to the gratitude of his Guests. We urge this 
point more strongly, because, from want of attention to it» we 
have seen more than once, persons whom many kindred ties 
would have drawn closely together, pass an entire day without 
opening their lips to each other, because they were mutually 
ignorant of each other*s names, professions and pursuits. 

To put an end at once to all Ceremony as to The Ordet in 
which the Guests are to Sit^ it will save much time and trouble 
if the Mistress of the Mansion adopts the simple and elegaot 
method of placing the name of each Guest in the plate which 
is intended for him. — This proceeding, will be of course the 
result of consideration, and the Host will place those together 
who he thinks will harmonize best. 

Le Journal des Darms informs us, that in several fashion- 
able houses in Paris, a new arrangement has been introduced 
in placing the company at a Dinner table. 

^' The Ladies M(t take their places, leaving intervals for the 
Gentlemen ; ^^^^eing seated, each is desired to call on a 
gentleman to sit beside her ; and thus the Lady of the house 
IS relieved frdm all embarrassment of etiqtiette as to rank and 
pretensions," &c.

If the Patty is la^, the Founders of the Feast ttiajr sit in 
the middle of the ^ble, instead of at each end, thus they 
will enjoy the pleasure of attending equally to all their Friends, 
and being in sotne degfee relieved from the occupatioii of 
Carving, will have an Opportunity of administering all those 
little attentions which contribute so much to the comfcfrl of 
their Guests. 

If the Guests have any respect for their Host, 6t prefer 
a well-dressed diriiier to one that is spoiled, instead of coming

The operations of the Cook are governed by the Clock : 
the moment the ttoasts, §-c. are ready ^ they must goto the

to is at home— if he is nbt, when he will be— and if he is

pered— our best Friends employ the time they are kept wait-

Ill-bred Bangs, who indulge their own caprice, regardless

That the intricate Old Canon iff " Non Nobis" should 
still continue to exclude all other Graces, — has excited my 
astonishment, ever since I first heard it some Thirty Years 
ago, when, thought I, can any thing be more Barbarous than to 
sing in a Foreign Tongue, of which not Orie in Ten of those 
who sing, and not One in an Hundred, of those who Hear, 
understand One Word in Ten of? Moreover, to complete 
this extreme Absurdity — ^the composer has contributed his 
utmost to involve these Latin words in the most absolute 
obscurity, by setting them in the form of a Fugiie, which 
{however pretty it may seem to th^ Eye and Ear of a subtle 
contrapuntist) as each singer pronounces a different Word, 
the Sense, is thereby, as confused as Sounds are in a Dutch 
Concert, where each man Sings a different Song ! — However, 
this composition is considered such an indispensable part of 
the ceremonial of Public Dinners, that it has been calculated 
that the good people of Great Britain do not pay less than 
TEN THOUSAND POUNDS a Year for the performance of itj ! 

Devotion is not excited by cramp Discords or difficulties 
of Execution — Haydn declared that the most sublime effect 
he ever heard produced by Music, was when he attended the 
Annual Meeting of our Charity Children in St. Paul's, when 
they all sung in Unisoru

MANN]fi«S MAKfe THE MaN. 

Good Manners have often made the Fortune of taany, 
who have had nothing else to recommend them : 

Ijl.1. Manners have as often mafred the hopes of those who 
have had every thing else to advance thetn. 

These regulation* may appear a little rigorous to those 
phlegmatic philosophers, 

** \f bo, past an pleasures^ damn the joys of sense, 
" With rev'i«iid dulneas, and g^aVe impotence,'' 

and are incapable of comprehending the Importance (espe- 
cially when many are invited) of a truly hospitable Entertain- 
ment : but Genuine Connoisseurs in the Science of Good

Tbose who serve oij( the Loaves and Pishes seldom seem 
to understand that jie is ftie best Carver who fills the plates 
of the greatest number of Guests, in the least portion of 
time. • 

To eifect this,ySU the plates and send them round — instead 
of asking each Individual if they choose Soup^ Fish, &c. or 
what particular part diey prefer, for as they cannot all be 
Choosers, you will thus escape making any invidious dis- 
tinctions. 

A dexterous Carver,* (especially if he be possessed with 
that determined enemy to Ceremony and Sauce, a keen appe- 
tite,) will help half a dozen people in half the time one of 
your would-be-thought polite folks wastes in making t:;vil 
^ces, &c. to a single Guest.

Fish that is fried should be previously divided into such 
portions as are fit to help at table — see (No. 145.) 

A prudent Carver will cut fair ;* arid observe an equitable 
distribution of the Dainties he is serving out — and regulate 
his helps, by the proportion which his dish bears to the num- 
ber he has to divide it amongst, taking into this reckoning 
Ihe qtiantum of Appetite the several guests are presumed to

that the ** easier he is pleased the (fftener he ttrill be iovited ;"

(if not with pleasure — or even content) with the liveliest ex- 
pressions of thankfulness whatever is presentecl to you — and 
forget not to praise the Cook, and* the same shall be reckoned 
\into you even as the praise of the Mistress. 

The Invalid or the Epicure, when he dines out, to save 
li-ouble to his friends, may carry with him a portable Maga- 
zine OF Taste. (See No. 463.)

" If he likes it ever so little, he will find occasi<;)n to

are, generally, tremendously officious in serving out the 
loaves and fishes of other people, for, under the notion 
of appearing exquisitely amiable, and kiliingly agreeable 
to the Guesis, they are ever on the watch to distribute them- 
selves the dainties which it is the peculiar part of the Master 
and Mistress to serve out, and is to them the most pleasant 
part of the business of the Banquet, the pleasure of helping 
their friends is the gratification, which is their reward for 
the trouble they have had in preparing the Feast : such 
^ Gentry are tho terror of all good Housewives ; to obtain 
their favourite Cut they will so unmercifully mangle your 
Joints, that a dainty dog would hardly get a meal from them 
after, which, managed by the considerative hands of an old 
Housekeeper, would furnish a decent Dinner for a large 
Family. — Vide '* Almanack des Gourmands.^*

The good-natured Founder of the Feast, highly amused 
at the Ecstacies each morsel created in its passage xjrver llie 
palate of the enraptured Gourmand^ thus encouraged the 
perseverance of his Guest — *' Cut away, my dear sir, cut

one neighbour may then help another. 

Dinner tables are seldom sufficiently Lighted^ or attended 
—an active Waiter will have enough to ao, to attend upon 
half a dozen active Eaters — ^there should be about half as 
many Candles as there are Guests — ^and their flame be about 
1 8 inches above the table— our foolish modern pompous 
Candelabras, seem intended to illuminate the Ceiling, rather 
thaFf to give light on the Plates, &c,

so troublesome, and so uncertain as Lamps^ nor so expensive, 
for to purchase a handsome Lamp will cost you iriote than 
will furnish you with Wax Candles for several years. 



FRiENDLY ADVICE TO COOKS,* 

AND OfHKR 

SERVANTS. 



On your first comine into a family, lose no time in im- 
mediately getting into the good graces of your fellow-servants, 
that you may learn from them the customs of the Kitchen, 
and the various rules and orders of the House. 

Take care, to he on good terms with the servant who 
waits at table ; — make use of him as your Sentinel to inform 
you how your work has pleased in the parlour^ by his report 
you may be enabled in some measure to rectify any mistake ; 
but request the favour of an early interview with your 
Master or Mistress, — depend as little as possible on second^ 
hand opinions.'^Tidige of your Employers, from your own 
observations, and their behaviour to you, — not from any 
idle reports from the other Servants, who, if your Master or 
Mistress inadvertently drop a word in your praise will im- 
mediately take alarm, and fearing your being more in favour 
than themselves, will seldom stick at trifles to prevent it, by 
pretending to take a prodigious liking to you, and poisoning 
your mind in such a manner as to destroy all your confi- 
dence, &c. in your Employers, and if they do not immediately 
succeed in worrying you away — ^will take care that you have 
no comfort while you stay : — ^Be most cautious, of those 



* A Chspter of Advice to Cooks, will) we hope, be iTound as useful 
us it is otri^cimil : all we ba?e on ibis sQbject in tihe works of our prtfle'

44 FRIENDLY ADVICE TO COOKS. 

who profess most : not only, beware of believing such honey- 
tongued folks, but beware as much, of betraying your suspi- 
cions of them — for that will set fire to the train at once, and 
of a doubtful Friend, make a determined Enemy. 

If you are a good Cook, r.nd strictly do your duty — you 
will soon become a favourite domestic — but never boast of 
the approbation of your Employers, for in proportion as they 
think you rise in their estimation — you will excite all the 
tricks, that Envy, Hatred, and Malice, and all Uncharitable- 
ness, can suggest to your fellow-servants; — every one of 
whom, if less sober, honest, or industrious, or less favoured 
than yourself, — will be your Enemy. 

While we warn you against making others your Enemy, 
take care that you do not Yourself become your own and 
greatest Enemy. — ** Favourites are never in greater danger 
of falling^ than when in the greatest favour^ ^ — which often 
begets a careless inattention to the commands of their em- 
ployers, and insolent overbearance to their equals, a gradual 
neglect of duty, and a corresponding forfeiture of that i?«- 
gard — which can only be preserved^ by the means which 
created it. 

** Those arts by which at first you gain it, 
You still must practice to maiotaiA it." 

If your Employers are so pleased with your conduct as 
to treat you as a friend rather than a servant — do not let 
their kindness excite your self-conceit, so as to make yoU 
for a moment forget you are one. Condescension even to 
a proverb produces Contempt in inconsiderate minds, and 
to such, the very means which Benevolence takes to cherish 
attention to duty, becomes the cause of the evil it is intended 
to prevent. 

To be an agreeable Companion in the Kitchen, without 
compromising your duty to your Patrons in the Parlour, 
requires no smsdl portion of good sense and good nature — 
in a word, you must " Do as you would be done by.'^ 

Act for, and speak of every body as if they 
were present. 

We hope the Culinary Student who peruses these pages 
■will be above adopting, the common, mean, and ever un-

stitecessful way' of "holding wHh the Hare, and running' 
with the Hounds," — of ciirr3ring favour with fellow-servants 
by flattering them, and ridiculing the Mistress when in the 
Kitchen, and then — prancing into the Parlour and purring 
about herj and making opportunities, to display all the little ' 
faults you can find [or invent) that will tell well against those 
in the Kitchen — assuring them, on your returb, — that .they 
were praised^ for whatever yon heard them blamed^ — and so, 
excite them to run more extremely into any little error 
which you think will be most displeasing to their Em- 
ployers — ^watching an opportunity to pour your poisonous lies ' 
into their unsuspecting ears, when there is no third person 
to bear witness of your Iniquity — makinp: your Victims be- 
lieve, it is all out of your sincere regard for them — assuring • 
them (as Betty says in the Man of the World,) " That in- 
deed you are no busybody that loves fending nor proving, 
but hate all tittling and tattling, aiid gossiping and back- 
biting,'* &c. &c. 

Depiend upon it, if you hear your fellow-servants speak 
disrespectfully of a Master or a Mistress with whom they 
have lived some time — it is a sure sign that they have some 
sinister scheme against yourself — if they have not been well 
treated, why have they stayed ? 

" There is nothing more detestable than defamation — I 
have no scruple to rank a Slanderer with a Murderer or an 
Assassin. — Those who assault the reputation of their Bene- 
fectors— and 1 rob you of that which nought enriches them' 
—•would destroy your Life, if they could do it with equal : 
impunity." 

" If you hope to gain the ' respect and esteem of others, 
and the approbation of your own Heart — ^be respectful and 
faithful to your Superiors; obliging and good-natured to 
your Fellow-servants — and charitable to all." You cannot 
be too careful to cultivate a Meek and Gentle Disposition ;— 
you will, find the benefit of it every day of your life — to pro- ^ 
mote peace and harmony around you, will . not only render 
you a. general Favourite with your^fellow-servants,-^-but will 
make you happy in Yourself. •

and humility^-Your Dress distinguished for, simpliijity, fni- 
gality, and neatness. A dressy servant is a disgrace to a 
house — and renders her employers as ridiculous as she does 
herself. If you outshine your companions in finery, you 
will inevitably, excite their Envy, and make them your 
Enemies." 

" Do every thing at the proper time." 
" Keep every thinaj in its proper place,'* 
" Use every thing for its proper purpose." 
. The importance of these Three Rules, must be evident, to 
all who will consider how much easier it is to return any thing 
when done with to its proper place, than it is to find it when 
mislaid — ^and it is as easy to put things in one place, as in 
another. 

, Keep your Kitchen and Furnitture as Clean and iN'eat as 
possible — ^which will then be an Ornament to it — a Comfort 
to your fellow-servants, and a Credit to yourself. Moreover, 
good Housewifery is the best recommendation to a good Hus- 
band» and engages men to honourable attachment to yon — 
she wlio is a tidy Servant gives promise of being a careful 
Wife. 

Giving away VictVMls* 

Giving away any thing without consent or privity of your 
Master or Mistress, is a liberty you must not take ;---4Ilharity 
and compassion for the wants of our fellow-creatures are very 
amiable virtues, but they are not to be indulged at ibe ex- 
pence of your own Honesty, and other people's property • 

When you find that there is any thing to spare, and that 
it is in danger of being spoiled by being kept too loi^,' — >it 
is very commendable in you to ask leave to dispose of it, 
while it is fit for christians to eat : If such permission is 
refused) the sin does not lie at your door. But you must- 
on no account bestow the least niorsel in contradiction' to the 
will of those to whom it belongs. 

** Never think any part of your business too trifling to be 
well done." 

"Eagerly embrace every opportunity, of learning any 
thing which may be useful, to yourself-ror of doing any 



FRIENDLY AOVICB TO COOKS. 47 

tliifig which, may benefit others." — Dallaway's Servant's 
Monitor^ 1815, p. 165, &c. a work well worth the perusal 
of Young Housekeepers and servants. 

Do not throw yourself out of a good place for a slight 
affront. " Come when you are called, and do what you are 
bid." Place yourself in your Mistress's situation, — and 
consider, — what you would expect from her, if she were in 
yours, and serve, reverence, and obey her accordingly. 

Although there may be ** more places than parish 
churches,"— it is not very easy, to find maiiy more Good 
ones.- 

** A Rolling stone never gathers Moss." 

" Honesty is the best Pohcy." 

" A Still tongue makes a Wise head." 

Saucy Answers are highly aggravating — and answer no 
good purpose. 

Let your Master or Mistress scold ever so much, or be 
ever so unreasonable ; — as " a soft answer turneth away 
wrath"—" so will Silence — ^be the best a Servant can 
make.'' 

One Rude Answer^ — extorted perhaps by harsh words, 
or unmerited censure, has cost many a servant the loss of a 
good place, or the total forfeiture of a regard, which had been 
growing for years. 

" If your Employers are hasty, and have scolded without

50 FRIENDLY ADVICE TO COOKS. 

There are as vsgious degrees of sensibility of Fklate, as 
there are of gradations of perfection in the Eyes and Ears of 
Painters and Musicians : — after all the pains which the Editor 
has taken to explain the Harmonv of subtle relishes, without 
nature has given the Organ of laste in a due degree, this 
book will, alas 1 no more make an Osborn* — ^than it can a 
REYNOLDS^r an Arne, or a Shield. 

Where nature has been most bountiful of this faculty, its 
sensibility is so easily blunted, by a variety of unavoidable 
circumstances, that the Tongue is very seldom, in the highest 
condition for appreciating delicate flavours, or accurately 
estimating, the relative force, of the various materials, the 
Cook employs in the composition of an harmonious relish : 
— O>oks express this refinement of Combination by sayings 
a well finished Ragout " tastes of every thing, and tastes of 
nothing f (this is *^ kitchen gibberish f** for a ^auce in which 
the component parts are well proportioned.) 

However delicately sensitive nature may have formed the 
organs of Taste, — it is only during those few happy mo- 
ments, that they are perfectly awake, and in perfect good 
humour — (alas ! how very seldom th^y are) that the most 
accomplished and experienced Cook, has a chance, of work- 
ing with any degree of certainty, without the auxiliary 
tests of the balance and the measure : by the help of these, 
when you are once right, it is your own fault if you are ever 
otherwise. 

The sense of Taste, depends much on the health of the 
Individual, and is hardly ever for a single hour, in the same 
state,^ — such is the extremely intimate sympathy, between 
the Stomach and the Tongue, that in proportion as the 
former is Empty ,f the latter is acute and sensitive : this is

the cause that ** good Appetite is the best Sauce''— ^usd that 
the dish we find savoury at Luncheoji^ is insipid at Dinner^ 
and at Supper quite tasteless. 

To taste any thing in perfection, the Tongue must be 
moistened, or the substance applied to it contain moisture-- 
the nervous papillae which constitute this sense are roused 
to still more lively sensibility by Salt — Sugar — ^Aromatics, 
&c. 

If the Palate becomes dull by repeated tasting, one of the 
best ways of refreshing it — ^is to masticate an Apple, or to 
wash your mouth well with milk. 

The incessant Exercise of Tasting, which a Cook is 
obliged to submit to during the Education of her Tongue, fr^ 
quently impairs the very faculty she is trying to improve. 
" 'Tis trae — 'tis pity — and pity 'tis," (says a graitd (rour- 
TMEod,] *< *tistnie, — her too anxious perseverance to penetrate 
the mysteries of Palatics, may diminish the tocf, exhaust the 
power, and destroy the Index, without which all her labour is 
in vain." 

Therefore, a sagacious Cook, instead of idly and wantonly 
wasting the excitability of her Palate— on the sensibility of 
which, her reputation and fortune depends, when she has 
ascertained the relative strength of the flavour of the various 
ingredients she employs, will call in the Balance and the 
Measure, to do the ordinary business, and endeavour to pre- 
serve her Organ of Taste, with the utmost care, that it may 
be a faithful Oracle, to refer to, on grand occasions, and new 
Compositions,* — of these an ingenious Cook may form as

The best way To warm cold Meat is to sprinkle the 
joint over with a little salt, put in a Dutch Oven, at some ' 
dislance before a gentle fire, that it may warm gradnally, 
watch it carefully, and keep turning it till it is quite hot and 
brown : it will take from twenty minutes to three-quarters of* 
an hour, according to its thickness, serve it up with Gravy ; 
— this is much better than Hashing it, and by doing it 
nicely, a Cook will get great credit. Poultry, (No. 530.*) ;' 
FniED Fish, (See Nb. 145,), &c. may be re-dressed in 
this way. # 

Take care of the Liquor you have boiled Poultry or Meat 
in; ia five minutes you may make it into excellent 
Soup— see 06*. to (No. 555.) and 229, No. 5, and the 7th 
chapter of the Rudiments of Cookery. 

No good Housewife has any pretensions to Ratiojial 
Economy who boils Animal Food without converting the 
Broth into some sort of Soup. 

However highly the uninitiated in the Mysteiy of Soup-* 
making, may elevate the external appendage of his OlfdjO- 
tory O^gan at the mention of " Pot Liquor," if he tastes^ 
(No. 5, or 218, 555, &e.) he will be as delighted with it, as

Let it continue to simmer gently four or five hours, strain it 
through a sieve into a clean basin. This will save a great 
deal of expense in buying Gravy Meat. 

Have the Dust, &:c. removed regularly once in a fort- 
night, and have your Kitchen Chimney swept once a 
month ; — ^many good Dinners have been spoiled and many 
houses burnt down by the soot falling — the best security 
against this, is for the Cook to have a long birch broom, 
and every morning brush down all the soot within reach of 
it-— Give notice to your employers when the contents of. 
your Coal cellar are diminished to a chaldron. 

It will be to little purpose to procure good Provisions, 
without you have proper utensils* to prepare them in : the 
most expert artist cannot perform his work in a perfect man- 
ner wirtiout proper instruments ;— you cannot have neat work 
without nice tools, nor can you dress Victuals well without 
an apparatus appropriate to the work required. See 1st page 
of Chapter VII. of the Rudiments of Cookery. 

In those houses where the Cook enjoys the confidence of 
her employer so much as to be intrusted with the care of the 
8tore»room, which is not very common, she will keep mi exact 
account of every thing as it comes m, and insist upon the 
toeight and price beins^ fixed to every article she purcnases— 
and occasionally — ^will (and it may not be amiss, to jocosely 
drop a hint to those who supply them that she does) re-weigh 
them, for her own satisfaction, as well as that of her ein-

she will also keep an account of every thing she takes from 
it, and manage with as much consideration and frugality as 
if it was her own property she was using, endeavouring to 
disprove the adage, that " plenty makes Waste^^* and re-

If you have a well-ventilated Larder, in a shady, dry, situa^ 
tion, you may make still surer, by ordering in your Meat and 
Poultry, such a time before you want it as will render it tender, 
which the finest meat cannot be, unless hung a proper time :

There are many Invalids who require a good Cook, and as (after 
reading this Book they will understand how much) their comfort and 
efiective existence depends on their food being properly prepared, will 
willUigly pay handsome wages — (who would not rather pay the Cook 
than the Doctor ?)— but have so little work in the Kitchen that one per- 
son may do it all with the utmost ease, without injury to their health, 
which is not the case in a large family, where the poor Cook is roasting 
and stewing all day— and is often deprived of her rest at night. No

timely provide for the infirmities of Age. Who will hire a superannuated

is in the best order for dressing — ue, either Ribs or Sir-Loia 
of Beef— or Leg, Loin, or Neck of Mutton, &c. 

Meat in which you can detect the slightest trace of putres- 
cency, has reached its highest degi'ee of tenderness, and 
should be dressed without delay: but before this period, 
which in some kinds of meat is offensive, the due degree of 
inteneration may be ascertained, by its yielding readily to the 
pressure of the finger, and by its opposing little resistance to 
an attempt to bind the joint. 

Although we strongly recommend that Animal Food should 
be hung up in the open air> till its fibres have lost some de- 
gree of their toughness — yet, let us be clearly understood, 
also to warn you — ^that if kept till it loses its natural sweet- 
ness, it is as detrimental to Health, as it is disagreeable to the 
Smell and Taste. , 

In very cold weather — ^bring your Meat, Poultry, &c 
into the kitchen, early in the morning — if you roast, boil, or 
stew it ever so gently and ever so long — if it be yrozen^— it 
¥rill continue tough and unchewable. 

Without very watchful attention to this, the most skilful 
Cook in the world will get no credit, be she ever so careful in 
the management of her Spit or her Stewpan. 

The time Meat should hang to be tender — depends on the 
heat and humidity of the air : if it is not kept long enough, 
it is hard and tough ; — if too long, it loses its flavour : — it 
should be hung where it will have a thorough air, and be dried 
with a cloth night and morning, to keep it from damp ^nd 
mustiness. 

Before you dress it, wash it well, — if it is roasting Beef, 
pare off the Outside, 

if you fear Meat,* &c. will not keep till the time it is 
wanted, — par-roast or par-hoW it, — it will then keep a couple

<< The freezing temperature, i. e. St degrees of Fahrenheit, is a per-

and lightning is quickly destructive ; but the greatest Enemy you have 
to encounter, is the Flesh-fly, which becomes troublesome about the 
month of May, and continues so till towards Michaelmas.'^ — For fur-

The Cook and the Butcher as often lose their credit, by 
Meat being dressed too fresh, as the Fishmonger does by fish 
that has been kept too long. 

Dr. Franklin in his philosophical experiments tells us, that 
if Game or Poultry be killed by Electricity it will become 
tender in the twinkling of an eye, and if it be dressed imme- 
diately, will be delicately tender. 

During the sultry summer months, it is almost impossi- 
ble to procure meat that is not either tough— or tainted — ^ihe 
former, is as improper as the latter for the unbraced stomachs 
of relaxed Valetudinarians, for whom, at this season. Poultry 
— Stews, &c., and Vegetable Soups, are the most suitable 
food, when the digestive organs are debilitated by the ex- 
treme heat, and profuse perspiration requires an increase of 
liquid to restore equilibrium in the constitution.

So much time is often lost in plactngevery thing in Apple-

lukewarm ; and to complete the mortification of the grand 
Gounnandy his meat is put on a sheet of ice in the shape of 
a Plate, which instantly converts the Gravy into Jelly, and 
the Fat into a something which puzzles his teeth and the roof 
of his mouth as much as if he had Birdlime to masticate : — a

It will save you infinite trouble and anxiety, if you can pre-

pany may flavour their Soup and Sauce, and adjust the vibra- 
tions of their Palate, exactly to their own fancy : but if the 
Cook give a decidedly predominant, and piquante ga&t to a 
dish, to tickle the tongue of two or three visitors, whose taste 
she knows, she m^ Uiereby make the Dinner disgusting to 
all the other gUests. 

JVever undertake more work than you are quite certain you 
can do well ; if you are ordered to prepare a larger Dinner 
than you think you can send up with ease and neatness, or 
to dress any dish that you are not acquainted with, rathisr 
than run any risk of spoiling any thing — (by one fault, you 
may perhaps lose all your credit) — ^request your employers to 
let you have some help. They may acquit you for pleading 
guilty of inability, but if you make an stttempt, and fail, will 
vote it a capital offence. 

If your Mistress professes to understand Cookery^ your 
best way will be to follow her directions: If you wish to 
please her, let her have the praise of all that is right, and 
cheerfully bear the blame of any thing that is wrong, only 
advise that all New Dishes may be first tried when the Fa- 
mily dine alone — when there is Company, never attempt to 
dress any thing which you have not ascertained that you can 
do perfectly well. -

' With all our love of punctuality, we must not forget that 
the first consideraMon must still be, thut the Dinner ''be well 
done wheq 'tis done." 

If any Accident occurs to any part of the Dinner— or if 
you are likely to be prevented sending the Soup, &c. to the 
table at the moment it is expected, send up a messa^re to 
your employers, stating the circumstance, and bespeak their 
patience for as many minutes as you think you shall want to 
be ready. This is better than either keeping the Company 
waiting without an apology ; or dishing your Dinner before 
it is done enough, or sending any thing to table which is 
disgusting to the Stomachs of the guests at the first appearr 
ance of it. 

Those who desire regularity in the service of their table, 
should have a DIAL of about twelve inches diameter, placed 
over the Kitchen fire-place, carefully regulated, to keep time 
exactly with the clock in the Hall or dining Parlour ; with a 
frame on one side, containing a taste table, of the pecu- 
harities of the master's palate, and the particular rules and 
orders of his Kitchen ; and on the other side, of the re- 
wards given to those who attend to them, and for long and 
faithful service. 

In small Families where a Dinner is seldom given — a great 
deal of preparation is required, and the preceding day must 
be devoted to the business of the Kitchen. 

On these occasions a Charmwoman is often employed to do 
the dirty work. Ignorant persons often hinder you more 
than they help you : we advise a Cook to be hired to assist 
to dress the Dinner — this would be very little more expense, 
and the work got through with much more comfort in the 
Kitchen and credit to the Parlour. 

When you have A very large entertainment to pre- 
pare, get your Soups and Sauces, Forcemeats, &c. ready 
the day before, and read the 7th Chapter of our Rudiments

TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 



To reduce our Culinary Operations to as exact a certainty 
as the nature of the processes would admit of; — we have, 
-wherever it was neeclluly given the Quantities of each article. 

The Weights, are Avoirdupoise* 

The Measure, — the graduated glass of theApothecariies; 
this appeared the most accurate and convenient ; — the Pint 
being divided into sixteen ounces, the Ounce into eight 
drachms. A middlincr sized Tea-spoon will contain ahout a 
Drachm ; — four such Tea-spoons are equal to a middling 
size Table-^oonj or half an Ounce ; — ^four Table-spoons to 
a common sized fFine-glass. 

The specific gravities of the various substances, beinsr so 
extremely dilferent, we cannot offer any auxiliary standards* 
for the Weights, which we earnestly recommend the Cook 
to employ, if she wishes to gain credit for accuracy and uni- 
formity in her business : these she will find it necessary to 
have as small as the quarter of a drachm Avoirdupois, which 
is equal to nearly seven grains Troy. 

Glass Measures, (divided into Tea, and Table-spoons,) 
containing from Half an Ounce — ^to Half a Pint, — may be 
had at Hancock and Shepherd^s Glass Shop, at Charing- 
Cross, and at Price's, near Exeter 'Change, Strand ; where 
also maybe had, — ^the double headed pepper and spice 
BOXES, with caps over the gratings. The superiority of 
these, by preserving the contents from the action of the air, 
must be sufficiently obvious to every one : the fine aromatic 
flavour of Pepper is soon lost y from the bottles it is usually 
kept in not being well stopped. Peppers are seldom ground 
or poiinded sufficiently fine. (See N. B. to 369.) 

N. B. The Trough Nutmeg Graters, made by Brooks, 
Ironmonger in Piccadilly, (near Bond Street), are by far the 
best we have seen, especially for those who wish to grate fine, 
and fast. 

Lloyd, furnishing Ironmonger, Strand, near Norfolk 
Street, sells Springs which weigh from an ounce to 20 
pounds, for£l Is. 

Lloyd^s Balance, which weighs from 7 of a drachm to 
20 pounds, is a very accurate and convenient machine for 
weighing. 

* A large Table-spoonful of Floiir weighs about half an Ounce. 



RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY. 



CHAPTER I. 

BOILING.* 

This most simple of Culinary processes is not often per* 
formed in perfection. It does not require quite so much 
nicety and attendance, as Roasting, — to skim your pot well, 
and keep it really boiling (the slower the better) all the while, 
to know how long is required for doing the joint, &c., and 
to take it up, at the critical moment when it is done enoi^, 
comprehends almost the whole art and mystery. This,how- 

* '* The process by which food is most commouly prepared for the 
table, — Boiling, — is so familiar 'to every one, and its effects are so 
uniform, and apparently, so simple, that few, I believe, have taken the 
trouble to inquire how, or in tohat iMxaner, those effects are produced ; 
and whether any, and what, ^improvements in that branch of cookery 
are possible. So little has this matter been an object of inquury, that 
few, very few indeed, I believe, among the Millions of Persons who 
for so many a^es have been daily employed in this process, have ever 
invon tfaeniselTes the trouble to bestow one serioos thought on the sub- 
ject. 

^* Boiling cannot be carried on without a very great expense of 
fuel ; but any boiUng'hot liquid (by using proper means for confinii^ 
the heat) may be kept boiling-hot for any length of time almost with- 
out any expense of fuel at all. 

" The waste qffuel in cuUnaiy processes, which arises from makiag 
liquids boil unnecessarily, or when nothing more would be necesaarv 
than to keep them boiling-hot, is enormous, I have not a doubt but ihatl 
much more than half the fuel used in aU the kitchens, public and pri* 
vate, in the whole world, is wasted precisely in this maimer. 

*^ But the evil does not stop here. This unscientific and slovenly 
matmer of cooking renders the process much 'more laborious and trou- 
blesome than otherwise it would be ; --and, (what by many will be 
considered of more importance than either the waste of fuel, or the 
increase of labour to the cook)— the food is rendered less savoury, and 
very probably less nourishing and less wholesome. 

" It is natural to suppose that maoy of the finer and more volatile 
parts of food (those which are best calculated to act on the organs id 
taste) must be carried off with the steam when the boiling is violent."— 
Count Romford's lOtb Essay, p. 3, and 6. 



BaiLtNG. 69 

ever, deifiands a patient alnl perpetual vigilance, of which few 
persons are capable. 

The Cook must take especial care that the water reali^ boUs 
aUthe while she is Cooking^ or she will be deceived in the time; 
and make up a sufficient fire (a frugal Cook will manage with 
much less fire for Boiling than she uses for roasting) at first, 
to last all the time, without much mending or stirring. 

When the Pot is coming to a Boil, there will alsvays, from 
the cleanest Meat and clearest Water, rise a Scum to the top 
of it: proceeding partly from the Water,— 4his must fa^ 
caTefuUv taken off as soon as it rises* 

On tnis depends the good appearance of aU boiled things. 

When you have scummed well, put in some cold water, 
which will throw up the rest of the scum. 

The oftener it is scummed, and the cleaner the top of the 
water is kept, the sweeter and the cleaner will be the Meat. 

If let alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the Meat;* 
which, instead of looking delicately white and nice, — will 
have that coarse and filthy appearance we have too often to 
complain of, and the butcher and Poulterer be blamed for 
the carelessness of the Cook in not scumming her pot. 

Many put in Milk, to make what they boil look white ; 
bnt this does more harm than good ;— others wrap it up in a 
cloth ; — ^but these are needless precautions, if the scum be 
attentively removed. Meat will have a much more delicate 
colour and finer flavour than it has when muffled up. This 
may give rather more trouble— but Those who wish to excel 
tn their Art must onlij consider how the processes of it can 
he most perfectly performed ; a Cook who has a proper pride 
and pleasure in her business, will make this her maxim on 
all occasions. 

It is desirable that meat for boiling be of an equal thick* 
ness, or before thicker parts are done enough, the thinner 
will be done too much. 

Put your Meat into cold f water, — ^in the proportion of 

* If, unfortunately, this should happen, the Cook must carefully take 
it off when she dishes up, either with a clean Sponge or a Paste-brush. 

t Cooks, however, as well as Doctors, disagree ; for some say, that 
'* all sorts of fresh meat should be put in when the water boils.'' I pre- 
fer the above method for the reason given — gentle stewing renders 
Meat, dec. tender, and still leaves It sapid and nutritive. 



I 



70 BOILING. 

about a quart of Water to a pound of Meat : it should be 
eovered with water during the whole of the process of Boil- 
ing, but not drowned in it — ^the less water, provided the meat 
be covered with it, the more Savoury will be the Meat, and 
the better will be the Broth. 

ITie Water should be heated gradually^ according to the 
thickness, &c. of the article boiled — ^for instance, a Leg of 
Mutton of 10 pounds weight, (No. 1.) should be placed over 
a moderate fire, which will gradually mahe the water hot^ 
without causing it to boil for about forty minutes — ^if the 
water boibmuch sooner, the meat will be hardened^ and 
shrink up as if it was scorched — ^by keeping the water a cer- 
tain time heating without boiling, the fibres of the meat are 
dilated, and it yields a quantity of scum, which must be taken 
off as soon as it rises. 

" 104. If a vessel containing water be placed over a steady 
Fire, the Water will grow continually hotter till it reaches 
the limit of boiling, after which the regular accessions of 
beat, are wholly spent in converting it into Steam. 

*^ Water remains at the same pitch of temperature^ however 
fiercely it boils. The only difference is, that with a strong 
fire it sooner comes to boil, and more quickly boils away, 
and is converted into Steam." — Buchanan on the Economy 
of Fuel, 1810. 

The Editor placed a Thermometer in water in that state 
which Cooks call gentle simmering^ — the heat was 212® — ^i« e. 
the same degree as the strongest boiling. 

Two Mutton Chops were covered with cold water,— 
and one boiled a gallop — and the other simmered very gently 
for three-quarters of an hour — the Chop which was slowly 
simmered was decidedly superior to that which was boiled, it 
was much tenderer, more juicy, and much higher flavoured^ — 
the Liquor which boiled fast, was in like proportion more 
savoury, and, when cold, had much more fat on its surface: 
—this explains why quick boiling renders Meat hard, &c.— 
because its juices are extra(!;ted in a greater degree. 

Reckon the time from its first comina to a boil. 

The old rule of 15 mmutes to a pound of meat, we think 
rather too little; — the slower it boils the tenderer)— -tbe 
plumper, — and whiter it will be. 



BOILING* 71 

For those who choose their Food thoroughly cooked — ^which 
all will who have any regard for their Stomachs — Twenty 
MINUTES TO A PouND for Fresh — and rather more for 
Salted Meat, will not be found too much for gentle sim^ 
nering by the side of the fire ; — ^allowing more or less time, 
according to the thickness of the Joint, and the coldness of the 
Weather, — ^to know the state of 'which, let a Thermometer he 
pboed in the Pantry^ and when it falls below 40, tell your 
Cook to give rather more time in both Roasting and Boiling, 
always remembering, the slower it boils the better. 

Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art ; and 
Cooks seem to suppose, they must be right, if they put meat 
into a pot, and set it over the fire for a certain time — inaking 
no allowance, whether it simmers without a bubble, or boils a 
gallop. 

Fresh killed Meat will take much longer time boiling than 
that which has been kept till it is what the butchers call rtpe, 
—and longer in cold than in warm weather ; — if it he frozen 
it must be thawed before boiling as before roasting : — if it be 
fresh kUledy it will be toxLgh and hardy if you stew it ever so 
long, and ever so gently. — In cold weather, the night before 
the day you dress it, bring it into a place of which the tem 
perature is not less than 45 degrees of Fahrenheit*s thermo;- 
meter. 

The size of the Boiling Pots should be adapted to what 
they are to contain : — ^the larger the saucepan the more room 
it takes upon the fire, and a larger quantity of Water requires 
a proportionate increase of Fire to boil it. 

A little Pot 
Is soon hot. 

In Small Families, we recommend BLOCK TIN saucepans, 
&c. as lightest and safest ; — if proper care is taken of them, 
and they are well dried after they are cleaned, they are by 
far the cheapest ; the purchase of a new Tin saucepan being 
little more than the expence of tinning a Copper one. 

Let THE Covers of your boiling pots fit close, not 
only to prevent unnecessary evaporation of the water, but 
to prevent the escape of the nutritive matter, which must then 



72 BOILING. 

remain eiiher in the Meat or in the Broth-^and the smoke* 
is prevented from insinuating itself under the edge of the lid, 
and so srivinsc the meat a bad taste. See Observations on 
Saucepans, in the 2nd page of chapter 7. 

If you let meat or poultry remain in the water after it is 
done enough, it will become sodden, and lose its flavour. 
' Bkef and Mutton a little under done (especially very 
large joints, which will make the better Hash or Broil,) is 
not a great fault — ^by some people it is preferred ; — ^bat 
Ijamhy — Porkj — and Kea/, are uneatable if not thoroughly 
boiled — but do not over do them. 

A Trivet, or Fish drainer put on the bottom of the boil- 
ing Pot, raising the contents about an inch and a half from 
the bottom, will prevent that side of the meat which comes 
next the bottom from being done too much, — and the lower 
part of the meat will be as delicately done as the other part ; 
and this vnW enable you to take out the contents of the Pot, 
vrithout sticking a fork, &c. into it. If you have not a trivet, 
use four Skewers, or a Soup-plate laid the wrong side 
upwards. 

Take care of the LiQUOR you have boiled Poultry or Meat 
in; in Five Minutes you may make it into excellent 
Soup, see Obs. to (No. 555,) and (No. 229.) 

The GOOD Housewife never boils a Joint vnthout con- 
verting the Broth into some sort of Soup, (Read No. 5, and 
chapter 7, and see page Q^). — If the Liquor be too salt, only 
use half the quantity, and the rest water ; v^ash salted Meat

in Cooking Animal Food. — From Mr. Tilloch's Phi- 
losophical Magazine. 

" It is well known, that, in whatever way the flesh of 
animals is prepared for food, a considerable diminution 
takes place m its weight. We do not recollect, however, 
to have seen anywhere a statement of the loss which 



BOILING. 73 

meat sustains in the various culinary processes, although it is 
pretty obvious that a series of experiments on this subject 
would not be without their use in aomestic economy. 

" We shall here give the result of a series of experiments 
which were actually made on this subject in a public esta- 
blishment; premising that, as they were not undertaken from 
mere Curiosity, but, on the contrary, to serve a purpose of 
practical utility, absolute accuracy was not attended to. CJon- 
sidering, however, the large quantities of provisions which 
were actually examined, it is presumed that the results may 
oe safely depended upon for any practical purpose. It would 
no doubt have been desirable to have known not only the 
whole diminution of weight, but also the parts which were 
separated from the meat in the form of aqueous vapour, jelly, 
ki, kc, ; but the determination, of these did not fall within 
the scope of the inquiry. . ^

**We shall only draw two practical inferences from the 
foregoing statement. — Ist. In respect of economy, it is more 
profitable to boil meat than to roast it. 2dly. Whether we 
roast or boil meat, it loses, by being cooked, from one^fifih 
to one-third of its. whole weight." 

The loss of Roasting arises from the melting out of the 
Fat, and evaporating the water ; but the nutritious matters 
remain condensed in the cooked solid. 

In BoiLiNa, the loss arises partly from the fat melted out, 
but chiefly from Gelatine and Osmazome being extracted 
and dissolved by the. water in which the meat is boiled ; 
there is, theretore, a real loss of nourishment, unless the 
Broth be used ; — ^when this mode of cooking beconoes the 
most economical.*

7^ BAKIXG. 



BAKING. 



The following Observations were written expressly for this 
^ork by Mr. Turner, English and French Bread and 
Biscuit Baker, the Corner of London Street and Fitzroy 
Square. 

*•* Baking is one of the cheapest, and most convenient 
ways of dressing a Dinner in small families ; and I may say 
that the Oven is often the ordx^ Kitchen a poor man Juu^ if 
he wishes to enjoy a joint of Meat at home with his family. 

" I don't mean to deny the superior excellence of Roasting 
to Baking ; but some joints, when Baked, so nearly approach 
to the same when Roasted^ that I have known them to be 
carried to the Table, and eaten as such with great satisfac- 
tion. 

" Legs, and Loins of Pork ; Legs of Mutton ; — 
Fillets of Veal ; — and many other joints, will Bake to 
great advantage if the meat be good ; I mean well fed, 
rather inclined to be fat ; if the meat be poor, no Baker can 
give satisfaction. 

" When baking a poor joint of meat, before it has been 
half baked, I have seen it start from the bone, and shrivel 
up scarcely to be believed. 

** Besides those Joints above mentioned, I shall enumerate 
a few Baked dishes, which I can particularly recommend. 

"A Pig, when sent to the Baker prepared for Baking, 
should have its Ears and Tail covered with buttered paper 
properly fastened on, and a bit of Butter tied up in a piece 
of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it will be apt to 
blister : with a proper share of attention from the Baker, I 
consider this way equal to a roasted one. 

'^ A Goose prepared the same as for roasting, taking care 
to have it on a stand, and when half done, to turn the other 
side upwards. A Duck the same. 

•* A Buttock of Beef the following way is particularly fine. 
After it has been in salt about a week, to be well washed 
and put into a brown earthen pan, with a pint of water ; 
cover the pan tight over with two or three thicknesses of 
cap or foolscap Paper — never cover any thing that is to be 



BAKING. 11 

baked with Brovm paper, the pitch and tar that is in brown 
paper will give the meat a smoky bad taste — give it four or 
iive hours in a moderate heated oven. 

'* A Ham (if not too old) put in soak for an hour, taken out 
and wiped, a crust made sufficient to cover it all over, and 
baked in a moderate heated oven ; cuts fuller of gravy, and 
of a finer flavour thaii a boiled one. I have been in the 
babit of baking small Cod-fish, — Haddock, — and 
Mackarel, with a dust of flour, and some bits of butter put 
OB tbem. Eels, when large and stuffed. Herrings and 
SvRATs, in a brown pan, with vinegar and a little spice, 
and lied over with paper. A Hare, prepared the same as 
for Roastii^, with a few pieces of Butter, and a little drop 
of Milk put into the dish, and Basted several times, will be 
found nearly equsd to roasting ; or cut it up, season it pro- 
perly, put it into ajar or pan, and cover it over and bake it 
in a moderate oven, for about three hours. — In the same 
manner, I have been in the habit of bakins; Legs and Shins 
of Beef, — Ox Cheeks, &c. prepared with a seasoning of 
Onions, Turnips, &c. : they will take about four hours : let 
them stand till cold to skim off the fat; then warm it up all 
together, o/t part, as you may want it. 

"All these 1 have been in the habit of baking for the first 
families. • ^ 

•*The time each of the above articles should take, depends 
much upon the state of the Oven, and I do consider the 
Baker a sufHcient judge ; if they are sent, to him in time, he 
must be very neglectful, if they are not ready at the time 
they are ordered."

RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY. 



CHAPTER 11. 

ROASTING. 

In all studies, it is the best practice, to begin with the 
plainest and easiest parts; and so on, by degrees, to such as 
are more diflacult : we, therefore, treated of plain Boiling, 
and we now proceed to Roasting : we shall then gradually 
unravel, to our Culinary students, the Art, (and mystery^ 
until developed in this work) of making, with the least 
trouble and expence, the most highly finished Soups, 
Sauces, and Made-dishes. 

Let the young Cook never foi^et, that Cleanliness is 
the chief Cardinal Virtue of the Kitchen ; — ^the first prepara- 
tion for Roasting is to take care that the Spit be properly 
cleaned with sand and water; nothing else. — When it has 
been well scoured with this, dry it with a clean cloth. If 
Spits are wiped cZean, as soon as the meat is drawn from 
them^ and while they are hot^ a very little cleaning will he 
required. The less the Spit is passed through the meat, the 
better,* and before you spit it, joint it properly^ especially 
necks and loins — that the Carver may separate them easily 
and neatly, and take especial care it be evenly balanced on 



* Small families have not always the convenience of roasting with 
a Spit, — a remark upon roasting by a striko is necesaiy. — ^Let 
the Cook, before she puts her meat down to the fire, pass a strong 
skewer through each end of the joint : by this means, when it is about 
half done, she can with ease turn the bottom upwards ; the ^rayy will 
then flow to the part which has been uppermost, and the whole joint 
be deliciously g^ravy-fuU. 

A Bottle-Jack, as it is termed by the furnishing iromongers, is a 
valuable instrument for roasting, 

A Ddtch Oven, Is aDother very convenient utensil, for roasting 
light joints, or warming them up.

the spit, that its motion toiay te ^gular, and the fire <)per^te 
eqiially on each part of it ; — ^therefore, be provided with 
Balancing Skewers, and Cookholds^ and see it is properly 
Jointed. 

Roasting should be done by thfe radiant heat, of a clear 
Rowing 'iire, otherwise it is $n fact Baksd — the Machines the 
Economical Grtite-tnakers call ROASTERS, are in pMtk 
English, Ovens. 

Count Rumford was certainly an exact i^nomist of Filelj 
trhen he contrived these things, — and those Philosophers who 
try all questions " According to Cocker " may vote for Baked 
Victuals ; — ^but the rational Epicure, who has been accus- 
tomed to enjoy 6E£F well RoA8'*r^i>, will soon be convinced, 
that the Poet who wrote our national Ballad at the end of 
this Chapter, was not inspired by Sir Benjamin Thompson's 
Cookery. 

All yoiu" attention in roasting, will be thrown away, if yoti 
do not take care that your Meat, especially Beefy (which ctn 
sieldom be bought ready Jor the spit except &n a Saturday,) 
has been kept l&ng enough to be Tender. See ** Advice to 
Cooks,"— and Obs. to (No 68.) 

Make up the FifiB in time ; let tt be proportioned to the 
dinner to be dressed, and about three or four inches longer^ 
at each end, than the thing to he roasted— -or the ends of the 
joaeat cannot be done nice and brown.

the hunnea she has to do^ as a Chemist^^he degree of Hea^ 
most desirable for dressing the different sorts of food ought to 
he attended to with the utmost precision. 

The Fire that is but just sufficient to receive the noble; 
Sirloin, (No 19,) will parch up a lighter joint. . 

From half an Hour, to an Hour, before you begin to Hoast, 
prepare the Fire^ by putting a few coals on, which will be 
sufficiently lighted by the time you wish to make use of your 
fire ;^— between the oars, and on the top, put small or lai^ 
Coals, according to the bulk of the Joint, and the time the 
fire is required to be strong ; — after which, throw the Cinders 
(wetted) at the back. 

Never put Meat down to a burnt up fire, if you can pos- 
sibly avoid it ; — ^but should the fire become fierce, place the 
Spit at a considerable distance, and allow a little more time. 

Preserve the fat,* by covering it with paper, for this 
purpose called *' Kitchen Paper," and tie it on with fiue 
twine ; — ^pins and skewers can by no means be allowed, they 
lire so many taps, to let out the Gravy : besides, the paper 
oi]ten starts from them and catches fire, to the great injury of 
the meat. 

if the thing to be' roasted be thin and tender, the fire 
should be litile and brisk ; — ^when you have a large joint to 
roast, make up a sound, strong fire, equally good, in ever^ 
part of the grate, or your meat cannot be eqmlly roasted, nor 
have that uniform colour which constitutes the beauty, of 
good roasting. 

---Oive the Fire a good stirring before you lay the joint 
down ;^-examine it from time to time, while the spit is 
going round; keep it clear at the bottom, and take care there 
are no smokv coals in the front, which will spoil the look 
and taste of the meat, and hinder it fi'om roasting evenly. 

When the joint to be roasted, is thicker at one end than 
the other, place the spit slanting, with the thickest part 
nearest the fire. 

Do not put Meat too near the fire at first ; — the larger the

hint, HU/artKer it fm»t he kept Jrom the Krc:— if once it 
gets scorched, the outside will mconae hard, and acquire a 
disagreeable empyreumatic taste: and the fire being prevented 
from penetrating into it, the meat will appear done, before it 
is little more than half done, besides losing the pale brown 
colour, which it is the Beauty of Roasted meat to nave. 

From 14 to 10 inches is the usual distance at which meat 
is put from the grate, when first put down : — it is extremely 
difficult to offer any thing like an accurate general rule for 
this, it depends ho much upon the size of the fire, and of 
that of the thing to be roasted 

Till some Culinary Philosopher shall invent a Tltermometer 
to a^ertain the heat of the Fire, and a graduated Spit^Rack 
to regulate the distance from it, the process of Roasting is 
attended by so many ever- varying circumstances, that it must 
remain among those which can only be performed well, — ^by 
frequent practice and attentive observation. 

** Mr. Watt, for his Steam Engines where Wood fuel is 
employed, allows three times the weight of Woody that he 
does of^Tewcaatle CoaU — ^it is calculated that about l41bs. per 
hour of good Newcastle Coal is required to produce a one 
horse power. A bushel of Newcastle Coals, wnich weighs J 
of a Cwi. is reckoned to produce as much heat as a Cwt. of 
Scotdi or Stitffordshire Coals.^* — ^Buchanan on Economy of 
fW, 1610. p. 82. 161 « and 252. Some are of opinion, that 
it requires about double the quantity of Scotch Coal to pro* 
docethesanie heat as that of Newcastle. << Dr. Irvine found the 
Heot of a Common Coal Fire to be about 799®** — Buchanan 
on Heat, p. 152. 

If you wish your Jack to go well, keep it as clean as pos- 
sible, oil it, and then wipe it ; if the oil is not wiped off 
^D, it will gather dust ; to prevent this, as soon as you have 
^one roasting, cover it up. — Never leave the winders on 
whilst the Jack is going round, unless you do it, as Swift 
says, " that it may fly off, and knock those troublesome 
servants on the head who will be crowding round your 
Kitchen fire." 

. Be very careful to p-ace the Dripping-pan at such a 
distance from the fire, as just to catch the drippings : — if it i«

too near, the ashes will fall into it, and spoil the Drippings* 
(which we shall hereafter show, will occasionally be found an 
excellent substitute for Butter or Lard ; to clarify Drippings^ 
see No, 83, and Pease and Dripping Soup^ (No. 229.) 
savoury and salubrious for only a Penny per Quart.) If 
it is too far from the fire to catch them, you will not only 
lose your drippings, but the Meat will be blackened, and 
spoiled by the foetid smoke, which will arise when the fat 
falls on the live cinders. 

ji large Dripping Pan is convenient for several purposes 
—it should not be less than 28 inches long, and 20 inches 
wide, and have a covered well on the side from the Fire to 
collect the Drippings — this will preserve them in the most 
delicate state; in a pan of ihe above size you may set fiied 
fish, and various dishes to keep hot. 

This is one of Painter's and Hawke's contrivances, near 
Norfolk-street, Strand. 

The time Meat will take Roasting, will vary according to 
the time it has been kept, and the temperature of the weather : 
-• — ^the same weight* will be twenty minutes, or half an hour 
longer in Cold JVeatheryf than it will be in warm, and if 
fresh killed, than if it has been kept till it is tender, 

A good Meat screen, is a great saver of Coals. It 
should be on wheels, have a flattop, and not be less than 
about three feet and a half wide, and with shelves in it, about 
one foot deep— it will then answer all the purposes of a large 
Dutch oven, Plate Warmer, Hot Hearth, &c. Soije are made 
wiih a Door behind, this is convenient, but the great heat 
they are exposed to, soon shrinks the materials, and the 

* This the Good Housewife will take up occasionally, and pass 
through a sieve into a stone pan : — by leaving it all in the Dripping-pao, 
until the Meat is taken up, it not only becomes very strong, but, when 
the meat is rich, and yields much of it, it is apt to be spilt in Bastiag^ —

\ If the Mba? is frozen, the usual practice is to put it into Cold 
Water till it is thawed, then dry and roast it as usual: — but we reoom-

currents of air through the cracks cannot be prevented, so 
they are better without the Door, We saw one at Mr, 
Lloyd's, famishii^ Irxmrnonger^ near Norfolk Street , 
Siremdj which had on the top of it — a very convenient Hot 
Closet — which is a great acquisition in Kitchens, where the 
Dinner waits after it is dressed. 

Every body knows the advantage of Slow Boiling — Slow 
Roasting is equally important. ' 

It is difficult to give any specific Rule for Time ; — ^butif 
your Fire is made as before directed, — your Meat Skreen 
sufficiently large to guard what you are dressing from currents 
of Air, and the meat is not Frosted, — ^you cannot do bett^^ 
than follow the old general rule of allowing rather more than 
a Qiurrter of an hour to the Pound ; — a little more or less> 
according to the temperature of the weather, in propor- 
tion as the piece is thick or thin, the strength'of the Fire, the 
nearness of the Meat to it, and the frequency with which you 
haste it : the more it is basted, the less time it will take, as 
it keeps the Meat soft and mellow on the outside, and the 
Fire acts with more force upon it 

Reckon the Time, not to the hour when Dinner is ordered, 
but to the moment the Roasts will be wanted : — supposing 
there are adozen people to sip Soup, and eat Fish first : you may 
allow them ten or fifteen minutes for the former, and about 
as long for the latter, more or less, according to the tempta- 
tions the " Bon Gout "of these preceding courses has to 
attract their attention. 

When the Joint is half c?on6,*— remove the Spit and 
Dripping Pan back, and stir up your fire thoroughly, that 
it may burn clear and bright for the Browning : when the 
steam from the Meat draws towards the fire,* it is a sign of 
its being done enough; but you will be the best judge of 
that, from the time it has been down, the strength of the 
Fire you have used, and the distance your Spit has been 
from it. 

Half an hour before your meat is done^ make some Gravy, 



• When the Steam begins to arise, it is a proof that the whole joint is 
thoTonghly saturated wiih beat; any unnecessary evaporation, is a 
'Wfisie of the best nourishment of the meat.

jt nearer the fire to brown it — If you wish to froth iy 
baste it, and dredge it with flour carefully ; you cannot do this 
delicately nice tvidiout a venj good light ; — the common fault 
«eem8 to be using too much Flour ;-^he Meat should have 
a fine light varnish of Froth, not the appearance of being 
covered with a paste \-^those who are particular about the 
Frothy use Butter instead of Dripping ; see Receipt to Roast 
a Turkey 9 No, 57 ; — 



" ADd send up what you Roast^ with relish-giving Protb,'' 

•says Dr. King, and present such tm agreeable appearance ta 
the Eye, that the Palate may be prepossessed in its favour at 
first sight ; therefore, have the whole course dishedy — before 
Roasts are taken from the fire. 

A Good Cook, is as anxiously attentive to the appearance 
and Colour of her Roasts, as a Court Beauty is to her Com-, 
plexion at a Birthday Ball. If your meat does not brown so 
much or so evenly as you wish, take two ounces of Glaze, 
i. e. Portable Soup, put four table spoonsful of water, and let 
it warm and dissolve gradually by the side of the fire. — This, 
will be done in about a quarter of an hour ; put it on the Meat 
equally all over with a paste brush the last thing before it goes 
to table. 

Though roasting is one of the most common, and is gene- 
rally considered one of the most easy and simple processes of 
Cookery, it requires more unremitting attention to perform 
it perkily well, than it does to make most Made-dishes. 

That Made-dishes are the most difhcult preparations, de- 
serve* to be reckoned among the Culinary Vulgar Errors ;— 
in Plain Roasting and Boiling, it is not easy to repair a mis- 
take once made ; and all the discretion and attention of a 
steady careful Cook, must be unremittingly upon the alert.* 



* A celebrated French writer has given us the following ohservatipns 
6n Roasting : — 

_ '* The Art of Roasting Tioiuuls to the precise degree, is one of the 
most difficult in this world, and you mag find hcSf a thousand good 
€ooks sooner than one perfect Roaster ; (See " Almanack des GoW". 



ROASTING. 85 

A diligeiit attention to time, — ^the distance of the Meat 
from, — and judicious management of the Fire, and frequent 
Bastings,* — are all the general rules we can prescribe, — we 



TMndtf" vol. i. p. 3T.) In tbe mansiods of the opulent they have, be- 
sides the Master Kitchener,— a Ronster, (perfectly independent of the 
iopser)) who is exclusively devoted to tbe Spit. 

'' All erudite Govrmanda know that these two important functiond 
cannot be performed by one artist; it is quite imiKtssible, at the same 
time, to superintend the operations of the Spit, and the Stewpan."— 
Further on, the same author observes: " No certain rules can lie given 
forRotsting, the . perfection ol it depending on many circomstanoes 
vhich are continually changing; tbe age, and size, (especially the 
thickness) of the pieces, the quality of the coals, the temjierature of the 
atmospliere, the currents of air in the kitchen, the more or less attention 
of tlie roaster; and lastly, the time of serving.— Supposing the Dinner 
onlered to be on table at a certain time, if tbe Fish and Soup are much 
lil^, and detained longer tlian tbe roaster has calculated ; or on the 
coBtrary, if they are despatched sooner than is expected, the roasts 
wiU in one case be burnt up, in the other not done enough— two mis- 
fortunes equally to be deplored. The first, however, is without a 
nnwdy ; five minutes on the Spit, more or less, decides the goodness 
*]f this mode of Cookery ; — it is almost impossible to seize the precise 
iDst&nt when it ought to be eaten ; which Epicures in roasts express, by 
spying: ** It is done to a turn.** So that there is no exaggeration in 
*'^y|iig»the perfect Roaster, is even more rare, than the professed 
Cook. 

" In small families, where the Cook — is also the Roaster,— it is 
aimost impossible the roasts should be well done; — ^the Spit claims ex- 
clusive attention, and is an imperious Mistress, who demands the entire 
devotion of her slave. But how can this be ? When the Cook is ob- 
lige, at the same time, to attend her Fish and Soup kettles, and watch 
her Stewpans and all their accompaniments ; — it is morally and phytic 
cally impossible, if she gives that delicate and constant attention to the 
Roasts, which is indispensably requisite^ the rest of tbe Dinner must 
often be spoilt ; and most Cooks would rather lose their character as a 
Roaster, than neglect the made-dishes and 'entremets,^ dsc, where they 
titiak they can display their Culinary Science, — than sacrifice these to 
tile Roasts, tbe perfection of whicli, will only prove their steady Vigi- 
lance and Patience.''

RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY. 



CHAPTER III. 

FRYING. 

Frying is often a convenient mode of Cookery — it maybe 
performed by a fire which will not do for Roasting or Boil- 
ing; and by the introduction of the Pan between the Meat 
and the Fire, things get more equally dressed. 

The Dutch Oven or Bonnet is another very conveni- 
ent utensil for small things, and a very useful substitute for 
the Jack, the Gridiron,. or Fryingpan, 

AFryingpan should be about four inches deep, with 
d perfectly Jlat and thick bottom, 12 inches long, and 9 
broad, with perpendicular sides, and must be half filled with 
Fat— Good Frying, is, in fact. Boiling in Fat. To make 
sure that the pan is quite deany rub a little Fat over it, and 
then make it warm and wipe it out with a clean cloth. 

Be very particular in Frying, never to use any Gil, — Butter, 
T-Lard, — or Drippings, — but what is quite clean, fresh, and 
free from salt. Any thing dirty spoils the look ; any thing 
bad tasted or stale spoils the fiavour ; and salt prevents its 
Browning. 

Fine Olive Oil, is the most delicate for frying; — ^but the 
best oil is expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is 
dressed with it. 

For general purposes, and especially for Fish, clean fresh 
Lard is not near so expensive as Oil or clarified Butter, and 
does almost as well. Butter often burns before vou are 
aware of it, and what you fry will get a dark and dirty ap- 
pearance. 

Cooks in large kitchens, where there is a great deal of 

ring, commonly use Mutton or Beef Suet, clarified, (see 

' 84) : if froih the kidney, all the 'better.

88 FRYING. 

Drippingj if nicely clean and fresh, is almost as good as 
any thing, — ^if not clean, it may he easily clarified ; see 
(No. 83). Whatever Fat you use — rafter you have done 
frying, let it remain in the Pan for a few minutes, and then 
pour it through a sieve into a clean basin, ii will do three or 
jour times at weU as it did at first ^ i. e, if it has not burned 
— ^but Mem. — the Fat you have fried Fish in must not be 
used for any other purpose. 

To know when the Fat is of a proper heat, accordiag to 
what you are to fry, is the great secret in frying. 

To fry Fish, — Parsley, — Potatoes, or any thing that 
is watery, your Fire must be very dear^ and the Fat quite hot^ 
which you may be pretty sure of, when it has done hissing, 
and is still. — We cannot insist too strongly on this point: 
if the Fat is not verjf Ao^ you cannot fry Fish either to a good 
colour^ or firm and crisp. 

To be quite certain, throw a httle bit of Bread into the 
pan ; if it fries crisp, the Fat is ready : if it bums the bread, 
it is too hot. 

The fire wider the pan must be dear and sharp^ otherwise 
the fat is so long before it becomes ready, and demands such 
attendance to prevent the accident of its catching fire,* that 
the patience of cooks is exhausted, and they frequently, from 
ignorance, or impatience, throw in what they are going to 
fry, before the fat is half hot enough. — Whatever is so fried, 
will be pale and sodden, and offend the Palate and Stomach 
not less than the Eye. 

Have a good light to fry by, that you may see when you 
have got the right colour: — a Lamp fixed on a stem with a 
loaded foot, which has an arm that lengthens out, and slides 
up and down like a reading candlestick, is a most useful ap^ 
pendage to Kitchen Fire-places^ which are very seldom light 
enough for the nicer operations of Cookery. 

After all, if you do not thoroughly drain the fcU from what 



* If this unfortanately happens, be not alarmed, — but immediately 
wet a basket of Ashes and throw them down the Chimney, and wet a. 
Blanket, and hold it close all round the Fire-place,— as soon as the 
current of air is stopped, the Fire will be extinguished ; with a char- 
coal sTovK there is no danger, as the diameter of the Pan exceeds that 
of the firs. 



FRYING. 89 

you. have fried, especially from those things that are full 
dressed in Bread Crumbs,* or Biscuit Powder ^ Sfc, your 
Cooking will do you no credit. 

The Dryitess of Fish depends much upon its having been 
fried in fat of a due degree of heat, it is then crisp and dry in 
a few minutes after it is taken out of the Pan — when it is not, 
lay it on a soft cloth before the fire, turning it occasionally, 
till it is: this will sometimes take 15 minutes: — therefore 
always fry Fish as long as this before you want them, for 
fear you may find this necessary. 

To FRY Fish see Receipt to fry SoleSy (No. 145.) which 
is the only circumstantial account of the process that has yet 
been printed. — If the Cook will study it with a little attention, 
she must soon become an accomplished Frier. 

Frying, thoiigh one of the most common of culinary ope- 
rations, is one that is least commonly performed perfectly 
well. 



* When you want a great many Bread Crumbs, divide your Loaf 
(which should be two days old,) into three equal parts— take the middle 
or crumb piece, the top and bottom will do for table— m the usual 
way of cuttings the erust is wasteti. 

Oatmeal is a very satisf actor}*, and an extremely economical Sub- 
stitute for B read Crum 6*, See (No .145.)

CHAPTER IV. 

BROILING. 



" And as now there is nought on the fire that is spoilini^y. 

We'll give you just two or three hints upon broiling, 

How oft you must turn a Beefsteak, and how seldom 

A good Mutton chop, for to have 'em both wf*!! done, 

And for skill in such cookery your credit 'twill fetch up. 

If your broils are well seasonM with good Mushroom Ketchup.*' 

Cleanliness is extremely essential in this mode of 
cookery. 

Keep your Gridiron quite clean between the bars, and 
bright on the top : — ^when it is hot, wipe it well with a linen 
cloth : — just before you use it, rub the bars with clean mut- 
ton suet, to prevent the Meat from being marked by the 
gridiron. 

Take care to prepare your Fire in time, so that it may 
burn quite clear : a brisk and clear fire is indispensable ; or 
you cannot give your meat that browning which constitutes 
the perfection of this mode of cookery, and gives a relish to 
food it cannot receive any other way. 

The Chops or slices should be from half to three quarters 
of an inch in thickness — if thicker, they will be done too 
much on the outside before the inside is done enough. 

Be diligently attentive to watch the moment that any thing 
is done ; — never hasten any thing that is broiling, lest you 
make smoke and spoil it. 

Let the bars of the Gridiron be all hot through, but yet 
not burning hot upon the surface : this is the perfect and 
fine condition of the Gridiron. 

As the Bars keep away as much heat as their breadth 
covers, it is absolutely necessary they should be thoroughly 
hot before the thing to be cooked be laid on them. 



BROILING. 91 

The Bars of Gridirons should be made concave, and ter- 
minate in a trough to catch the Gravy and keep the Fat from 
dropping into the. fire, and making a smoke, which will spoil 
the Broil . 

Upright Gridirons are the best, as they can be used at 
any fire, without fear of smoke ; aod the gravy is preserved 
in the trough under them. 

N.B. Broils must be brought to table as Ho^ as possible: 
set a Dish to heat, when you put your Chops on the Grid- 
iron, from whence to the Mouth their progress must be. as 
quick as possible. 

When the Fire is not clear^ the business of the Gridiron 
may be done by the Dutch Oven or Bonnets

CHAPTER V. 

VEGETABLES. 

The Marketing Tables at the end of this work show 
the Seasons of VegetahleSy and point out the time when they 
are Best and Cheapest. 

There is nothing in which the difference between an Elegant 
and an Ordinary table is moreseen^ thaninthe dressing o/Ve^ 
getabUs, more especially of Greens : — ^they may be equally as 
fine at first, at one place as at another ; but their look and 
taste are afterwards very different, entirely from the careless 
way in which they have been cooked. 

They are in greatest Perfection^ when in greatest Plenty^ 
t. e. when in full season. 

By Season, — I do not mean those early days, that luxury 
in the buyers, and avarice in the sellers about London, force 
the various vegetables : but that time of the year in which by 
nature and common culture, and the mere operation of the 
Sun and Climate, they are in most plenty and perfection. 

Potatoes and Peas are seldom worth eating before Mid- 
summer: — ^Unripe Vegetables, are as insipid and un^ 
wholesome as Unripe Fruits. 

As to the quality of Vegetables, the middle size are pre- 
ferred to the largest, or the smallest ; they are more tender, 
juicy, and full of flavour, just before they are quite full grown : 
— ^Freshness is their chief value and excellence, and I should 
as soon think of roasting an Animal alive, as of boiling a 
Vegetable after it is dead. 

The Eye easily discovers if they have been kept too long : 
— they soon lose their Beauty in sJl respects. 

Roots^ Greens, Salads, &c., and the various productions 



VEGETABLES. 93 

of the Garden, when first ^thered, are plump and firm, and 
have a fragrant freshness no art can |ive them again, when 
tliey have lost it by long keeping; though it will refresh' 
them a little to put them into cold spring water for some time 
before they are dressed. 

To boil them in soft water will preserve the colour best of 
such as are Green ; if you have only hard water, put to it a 
tej^poonful of Carbonate of Potash, 

Take care to washartd cleanse them thoroughly from dust, 
dirt, and insects : this requires great attention : pick off all 
the outside leaves, tiim them nicely, and if not quite fresh 
gathered and have become flaccid, it is absolutely necessary 
to restore their crispness before cooking them, or they will 
be tough and unpleasant : lay them in a pan of clean water, 
with a handful of salt in it, for an hour before you dress 
them. 

** Most vegetables being more or less succulent, their fulF 
proportioa of fluids is necessary for their retaining that state 
of crispness and plumpness which they have when growing*; 
On being cut or gathered, the exhalation from their surface 
continues, while, from the open vessels of the cut surface^ 
there is oflen great exudation or evaporation, and thus their 
natural moisture is diminished, the tender leaves become 
flaccid, and the thicker masses or roots lose their plumpnes*.' 
—This is not only. less pleasant to the Eye, but is a real injury 
to the nutritious powers of the vegetable : for in this flaccid- 
and shrivelled state its fibres are less easily divided in chew- 
ing, and the water which exists in vegetable substances, in 
the form of their respective natural juices, is directly nutri- 
tious. The first care in the preservation of succulent vege- 
tebles, therefore, is to prevent them from losing their natural 
moisture.*' — Sup. to Edm, Encyclop, vol. iv. p. 335. 

They should always be boiled in a saucepan by themselves, 
and have plenty of water : if Meat is boiled with them in 
the same pot, ihey will spoil the look and taste of each 
other. 

If you wish to have Vegetables delicately clean,^ put on 
jour Pot, make it boil, put a little salt in it, and skim it per- 
fectly clean before you put in the Greens, &c, which should 
not be put in till the water boils briskly : tha quicker they. 



94 VEGETABLBS. 

boiU the greener they will be :-^wheii the Vegetables sink, 
they are generally done enoi^h, if the water has been kept 
constantly boiling. Take them up immediately^ or they unU 
lose their colour and goodness. Drain the water from them 
thoroughly before you send them to table. 

This branch of Cookery requires the most vigilant attention. 

If Vegetables are a minute or two too long over the Fire^ 
they lose all their beauty and flavour. 

If not thoroughly boiled tender^ they are tremendously 
Indigestible^ and much more troublesome during their resi^* 
dence in the Stomach, than imder-done Meats.* 

To preserve, or give Colour in Cookery, many good dishes 
are spoiled : but the rational Epicure, who makes nourish* 
ment the main end of Eating, will be content to sacrifice the 
Shadow, to enjoy the Substance. Vide Obs» to No. 322. 

Once for all, take care your v^tables are fresh ; — ^for as 
the Fishmonger often suifers for the sins of the Cook, so the 
Cook often gets undeservedly blamed instead of the Green- 
grocer. 

Vegetables, in this metropolis, are often kept so long, that 
no art can make them either look or eat well. 

Strong scented Vegetables should be kept apart : Leeks, 
or Celery, laid among Cauliflowers, &c. will quickly spoil 
them. 

*^ Succulent Vegetables are best preserved in a cool shady 
and damp place. 

^ Potatoes, Turnips, Carrots, and similar Roots, intended to 
be stored up, should never be cleaned from the earth adhcT'* 
ing to them, till they are to be dressed. 

^ They must be protected from the action of the air, and 
frost, by laying them in heaps, burying them in sand or 
earth, &c. or covering them with straw or mats. 



* '' Cadliflowrrs and other Vegetables are often boiled only 
crisp to preserve their Beauty. For the look alonp they had better not 
be boileid at all, and almost as well for the use, as in this crude statft 
they are scarcely digestible by the strongest stomach. On the other 
hand, when over boiled, they become vapid, and in a state similar to 
decay, in which they afford no sweet purifying Juices to the body, but 
load it with a mass of mere feculent matter.'' — Domestic Management, 
lamo. 18J3, p. 09. 



VEGETABLES. 95 

** The action of Frost destroys the life of the Vegetable, 
and it speedily rots." — Supp. to Edinb, Encyclopedia^ vol. 
iv. p. 335. 

Mem. When Vegetables are quite fresh gathered, they 
will not require so much boiling, by at least a third of the 
time they take,' when they have been gathered the usual time 
those are that are brought to Public markets.

CHAPTER VT. 



FISH. 



The Marketing Tables at the end of this Work show| 
when each kind of Fish is Best and Cheapest. 

This department of the business of the Kitchen requires! 
considerable experience, and depends more upon practice 
than any other ; — a very few momenJ^ more or less, will 
thoroughly spoil Fish ;* which, to be eaten in perfection, 
must never be put on the Table, till the Soup is taken otf. 



* When the Cook has large dinn^r^ to prepare, acd the time of senrinefl 
uncertain, she will get more credit by fribd^ (see No. 145.) or stewed, 
(see No. 164.) than by boiled Fish. It is also cheaper, and much 
sooner carved, (see No. 145.) 

Mr. Ude, paire 238 of his Cookery— advises, ** If you are obliged to 
wait after the Fish is done, do not let it remain in the water, bnt keep 
the water boiling — and put the fish over it, and cover it with a damp 
doth — when the dinner is called for, dip the fish again in the water— 
and serve it up." . , ,

So many circumstances operate on this o<:;casion, it id 
almost impossible to write general rules. 

There are decidedly different opinions, whether Fish should 
be put into cold, tepid, or boiling water. 

We believe for some of the fame the Dutch Cooks have 
acquired, they are a little indebted to their situation, affording 
them a plentiful supply of Fresh Fish for little more than the 
trouble of catching it ; — and that the superior excellence of 
the fish in Holland, is bediuse none are used, unless they are 
brought alive into the Kitchen, (Mackarel excepted, whicifi die 
the moment they are taken out of the water) . The Dutch 
are as nice about this, as Seneca says the Romans* were ; 
who, complaining of the luxury of the times, says, " they^ 
are come to that daintiness, that they will not eat a Fish, 
unless upon the same day that it is taken, that it may taste of 
the sea, as they express it.'' 

On the Dutch flat coast, the Fish are taken with nets ; on 
OUT rocky coast, they are . mostly caught by bait and hook, 
which instantly kills them. — Fish are brought alive by land, 
to the Dutch markets, in water casks with air-holes in the 
top. — Salmon, and other fish, are thus preserved in rivers, in 
a well-holC) in the fishing-boat. 

All kinds of Fish are best some time before they 
begin to spawn — and are unfit for food for some time after 
they have spawned. 

fish, like ^nimcdsy are' fittest for the Table when they are 

just full grown ; and what has been said in the sixth sentence* 

of the first page of Chapter V. respecting Vegetables^ applies 

equally well to Fish , 

The most convenient Utensil to boil Fish in, is a Turbot-

Kettlb : this should be 24 inches long, 22 wide, and nine 
deep. It is an excellent vessel to boil a Ham in, &c. &c. 

The good folks of this Metropolis are so often disappointed 
by having Fish which have been kept too long, — ^that Aey are 
apt to run into the other extreme, and suppose that Fish will 
not dress well, unless it is absolutely alive. This is true of 
Lobsters, &c. (No. 176) and may be of Fresh-water Fish, 
but certainly not of some Sea Fish. 

Several respectable Fishmongers and experienced Cooks 
have assured the Editor, that they are often in danger of losing 
their credit, by fish too fresh, and especially Turbot and CW, 
which, like Meat, require a certain time before they are in 
the best condition to be dressed : — ^they recommend them to 
be put into Cold Water j Salted in proportion, of about a quar- 
ter of a pound of salt to a gallon of water. Sea Water is 
best to boil Sea fish in : — ^it not only saves the Expense of 
Salt, but the flavour is better : let them boil slowly till done; 
the sign of which is, that the skin of the fi^sh rises up, and 
the Eyes turn white. ' . 

It is the business of the Fishmonger to cle^n them, &c. 
but the eareful Cook will always wash them again. 

Garnish, with slices of Lemon — ^finely scraped Horse- 
radish— fried Oysters^ (No. 1 83.)— 5mp/^5, (No. 173.} — or

No. 145. 

The Liver — Roe' — and Chitterlings — should be placed so 
that the Carver may observe them, and invite 'the Guests to

N.B. Fish, like Meat, requires more cooking in cold than 
in warm weather; — ^if it becomes Frozen,* it must be

page of the 2d Chapter of the Rudiments of Cookery. To

CHAPTER VII. 

BROTHS AND SOUPS. 



The Cook must pay continual attention to the condition of- 
her Stewpans* and Soup kettles, &c. — which should be ex- 
amined every time they are used. The prudent Housewife will 
carefully examine the condition of them herself at least once a 
month. Their covers also must be kept perfectly clean and 
well tinned, and the Stewpans not only on the inside, butabout 
a couple of inches on the outside : — many mischiefs arise from 
their getting out of repair, and if not kept 7iicely tinned^ aUyour 
good work will he in vain; the Broths and Sopps will look 
green and dirty, taste bitter and poisonous, and will be spoiled 
both for the Eye and Palate, and your credit will be lost. 

The- Health, and even Life of the family depends upon 
this, and the Cook may be sure, her Employers had rather 
pay the Tinman's bill than the Doctor's ; — therefore, atten- 
tion to this cannot fail to engage the regard of the Mistress, 
between whom and the Cook, it will be my utmost endea- 
vour to promote perfect Harmony. 

If a servant has the misfortune to scorch or blister the 
tinning of her Pan,f which will happen sometimes to the 
most careful Cook, — I advise her, by all means, immediately 
to acquaint her employers, who will thank her for candidly 
mentioning an accident ; and censm'e her deservedly if she 
conceal it. 

Take care to be properly provided with Sieves and 
Tammy cloths, — Spoons and Ladles, — make it a rule 

without an exception^ never^ to use them till they are well 

— — 

* We prefer the form of a Stewpan, <o the Soup-Pot, — the former is 
more convenieut to skim ; the most useful size is 12 inches diameter 
by 6 inches deep : this we would have of Silver,— or Iron,— or Cop- 
per lined (not plated> with Silver.

out first washing them out with boiling water, and rubbing 
them well with a » dry cloth and a little bran, to clean them 
from grease, ss^, &c. or any bad smell they may have got 
since they were' last used : never neglect this. 

Though we do not suppose our Cook to be such a naughty 
Slut, as to wilftilly neglect her Broth Pots, &c. yet we niay 
tecommend Iter to wash them immediately, and take care they 
are thorou^jty dried before the fire, before they are put by, 
and to keep them in a dry place, for damp will rust and de- 
stroy them very soon :— -attend to this the first moment you 
can spare "after the dinner is sent up. 

Never put by any Soup, Gravy, &c., in a metal utensil; 
in which, never keep any thing longer than is absolutely ne- 
cessary for the purposes of Cookery, — ^the acid, vegetables, 
^nd fat, &c. efnployed in making them, are capable of dis- 
solving them ; therefore, stone or earthen vessels should be 
used for this purpose. 

Stewpans, Soup-pots, and Preserving Pans, with • 
thick and round bottoms, (such as saucepans are made with) 
will wear twice as long, and are cleaned with half the trou- 
ble, as those whose sides are soldered to the bottom, of which 
iSaitd and Grease get into the joined party and Cookevs say 
that it is next to an impossibility to dislodge it, even if their 
nails are as long as r)ebuchadnezzar*s. The Editor claims 
the credit of having first suggested the importance of this 
construction of these utensils. 

Take care that the Lids fit as close as possible, that the Broth, 
Soup, and Sauces, &c. may not waste by evaporation.* They

most temperate, mild, and innocent, of common spices, almost all of 
which it far surpasses, by promoting the digestion of meat, and mode- 
rately heating and strengthening the stomach, and doing those friendly 
ofiices to the bowels, we generally expect from spices.*' We have

The general fauh of our English Souba, seems to he the 
employment of an excess of Spice, and too small a portUm of 
Roots and Herbs.* 

Besides the ingredients I have enumerated, many Oulinanr 
serihes indiscriminately cram into almost every Dish (in such 
inordinate Quantities — one would suppose they were working 
for the Asbestos palate of an Indian Fire-Eater) Anchovies, — 
Garlic,t — ^Bay leaves, and that hot fiery spice Cav«»««J pep- 
per; this, which the French call (not undeservedly) Piment 
enragi, (No. 404,) has somehow or other, unaccountably 
acquired a character for being very wholesome — whilst the 
milder Peppers and Spices, are cried down, as destroying the 
sensibility of the Palate, and Stomach, &c., and being the 
source of a thousand mischiefs. — We should just as soon re- 
commend Alcohol as being less intoxicating than fVine. 

The best thing that has been said in praise of Peppers is, 
" thsM: with all kinds of Vegetables, as also with Soups (espe- 
•' cially vegetable soups) and Fish, either Black or CoLyenns 

Pepper may be taken freely : they are the most useful 

stimulants to Old Stomachs, and often supersede the crav-

* " Point de Legumes^ point de Cuisini^ef" U a favourite culinary 
ndidfre of the French kitebeo ; and deserves to be so : a better soup may 
be made with a couple of pounds of Meat and plenty of Vegetables, than 
our common Cooks will make you with four times that quantity of meat ; 
all for want of knowing the uses of Soup pootaj, and ^^eet and 8arory 
herbs. 

t Many a i^^ood dish is spoiled, by the cook not knowing the pr<^r 
use of this, which is to give a flavour, and not to he predominant over 
the other ingredients : a morsel mushed with the point of a knife, and 
stirred in, is enough. See (No. 402.) 

I Foreigners have strange notions of English Taste, on which one of 
their Culinary Professors has made the following comment: '* The 
organ of Taste in these Islanders is very different from our Delicate 
Palates — and cuuce that would excoriate the palate of a Frepchman, 
would be hardly piquante enough to make any impression on that of 
an Englishman; — thus, they prefer Port to Cliiret,*' &c. As fay as 
concerns our Drinking, we wish there was not quite ao much truth in 
Monsieur*8 remarks: but the characteristic of the French and Eqglis)i 
kitchen is, Sauce without Substance — and Substance without Sauce,

ahle to excite and keep up the languid action of 'feeble and

There is no French Dinner without Soup, which is re- 
garded as an indispensable Overture ; — ^it is commonly followed 
by " k Coup d'ApreSy^^ a Glass of pure Wine, which they 
coQsider so wholesome after Soup, that their Proverb says, the 
Physician thereby loses a Fee : — whether the glass of Wine 
be so much more advantageous for the Patient than it is for 
his Doctor, we know not, but believe it an excellent plan to 
begin the Bainquet with a basin of good Soup, which, by 
ffloderating the Appetite for solid Animal foodi is certainly a 
salutiferous custom. — Between the Roasts and the EntremSts 
they introduce '' le Cktup dti Milieu* *-^or a small glass of 
Jamaica Rum^ or Essence of Punchy see (No. 471); or 
CuRAgAo (No.474.) 

The introduction of LiQuisuRS is hy no means a modern 
custom ; our ancestors were very fond of a highly spiced 
stimulus of this sort, commonly called Ipocrasse^ which gene- 
rally made a part of the last course,— or was taken immediately 
after dinner.

then put them in a bage fbagj of wullen clothe, tnade there-

with the Dram, is presented on a waiter, little square pieces 
of Cheese, slices of cold Tonj2:ue, and dried Tongue, and dried 
Toast, accompanied with fresh Caviar, 

We again caution the Cook to avoid Over-Seasoning^ espe- 
cially with predominant flavours, which, however agreeable 
they may be to some, are most extremely disagreeable to 
others, see page 48.

The proportion of Wine (formerly Sack, — ^then Claret— 
now Madeira or Port (should not exceed a lai^e Wiiie-glassfW 
to a Quart of Soup : — ^this is as much as can be admitted, 
without the vinous flavour becoming remarkably predomi- 
nant ; — ^though not only much larger quantities of Wine, (of 
which Claret is incomparably the best, because it contains 
less spirit and more flavour, and English palates are less 
acquainted with it) ; but evenvSritable Eau de Ttels ordered 
in many books, and used by many (especially Tavern Cooks) 
—-so much are their Soups overloaded with relish, that if you 
will eat enough of them they will certainly make you Drunk, 
if they don't make you Sick — all this, frequently arises from 
an old Cook measuring the excitability of the Eaters' palates 
by his own, — which may be so blunted by incessant Tasting, 
that to awaken it, requires Wine instead of Wuter, and Cay- 
enne and Garlick, for Black Pepper and Onion. 

Old Cooks are as fond of Spice, as Children are of Sugary 
and season SOUP, which is intended to constitute a principsd 
part of a Meal, as highly as SAUCE, of which only a spoon- 
ful may be Relish enough for a plate 'of insipid Viands. See 
OBS.to (No. 355). — However, we fancy these lai^ quantities 
of Wine, &c. are oftener ordered in Cookery Books than used in

ployers too much at heart, and love " Sauce d la Langue*^ 
too well to overwine their Soup, &c. 

Truffles and Morels* are also set down as a part of 
most receipts. — These, in their Green state, have a very rich 
high flavour, and are delicious additions to some dishes, or 
sent up as a stew by themselves, when they are fresh and 
fine ; but in this state they are not served up half a dozen 
times in a year, at the first tables in the kingdom : — when 
dried, they become mere ** chips in pottage^'"* and serve only 
to soak up good gravy, — from which, they take more taste than 
they give. 

The j^rt of composing a rich Sonp, is so to proportion the 
several ingredients one to another, that no particular Taste 
be stronger than the rest ; — ^but to produce sucn a fine harmo- 
nious relish, that the whole is delightful ; — this requires that 
judicious combination of the matenals which constitutes the 
** chef-d'oeuvre^'* of Culinary Science. 

In the first place, take care that the Roots and Herbs 
be perfectly well cleaned; — proportion the Water to the 
quantity of Meat, and other ingredients, — generally a pound 
of meat to a quart of water for Soups ; and double that quan- 
tity for Gravies. If they Stew gentb/y little more water need 
be put in at first, than is expected at the end ; — ^for when the 
Pot is covered quite close, and the fire gentle, very little is 
wasted. 

Gentle Stewing is incomparably the best, — the Meat is 
more tender, and the Soup better flavoured. 

It is of the first importance, that the Cover of a Soup Kettk 
should fit very close, — or the broth, will evaporate before you 
are aware of it. The most essential parts are soon evaporated 
by Quick Boiling — without any benefit, except to fatten the 
fortunate Cook who inhales them. An evident proof that 
these Exhalations f possess the most restorative qualities, is,

that thbCook— who is in jg«neralthe least Eater,— is, as ^ne- 
rally, the Fattest person in the Family, from continually bjgiixg 
surrounded by the Quintessence of all the food she dresses,— 
whereof, she seods to her Master only the fibres and Cal- 
cinations, — who is consequently Thin — Crouty — and the 
Victim of Diseases arising from insufficient nourishment. 

It is not only (he fibres of the meat which nourish us, but 
the Juices they contain, and these are not only extracted but 
exhaled, if it be boiled fast in an open vessel — a succulent 
soup can never be made but in a well closed vessel^ which 
preserves the nutritive parts by preventing their dissipation. 
— This is a fact of which every intelligent person will soon 
perceive the importance. 

Place your Soup pot over a moderate fire f which will make 
the water hot^ without causing it to boil for at least half on 
hour ; — if the water boils immediately, it will not penetrate 
the meat, and cleanse it from the clotted blood, and other 
matters which ought to go off in skum ; the meat will be 
hardened aH'oyer by violent Heat, — ^will shrink up as if it was 
scorched, and give hardly an^ Gravy ;— on the contrary, — ^by 
keeping the Water a certain time heating without boiling, — ^the 
Meats swells — becomes tender — its fibres are dilated — and it 
yields a quantity of Skum, which must be taken off as soon 
as it appears. 

It is not till after a good Half Hour's hot infusion, that we 
may mend the Fire, and make the Pot boil— still continue to 
remove the Skum, and when no more appears, put in the 
Vegetables, &c. and a little salt. These will cause more 
^kum to rise, — which must be taken off immediately — then 
cover the pot very closely, and place it at a proper distance 
from the fire, where it will boil very gently, and equally, and 
by no means fast. 

By quick and strong Boiling, the volatile and finest parts 
le ingredients are evaporated, and fly off with the steam.

If Soup is loo thin or too weak, — take off the cover of your 
fK>up-pot, and let it boil till some of the watery part of it has 
evaporated, — or else, add some of the Thickening materials 
we have before mentioned ; and have at hand some plain 
Browning: see (No. 322), and the Obs. thereon. This 
simple preparation is much better than any of the compounds

bearing that name, as it colours Sauce or Soup, without much 
interfering with its flavour, and is a much better way of Co- 
lourii^ them than burning the surface of the Meat. 

When Soups and Gravies are kept from day to day, in Hot 
weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into 
fresh scalded tureens, or pans, and placed in a cool cellar ; — 
in Temperate weather every other day may be enoughs 

We hope we have now put the common Cook into posses- 
sion of the whole arcana of Soup-making, — without much 
trouble to herself, or expense to her employers ; — ^it need not 
be said, in future, that an Englishman only knows how to 
make Soup in his Stomach, by swilling down a large quantity 
pf Ale, or Porter, to quench the thirst occasioned by the meat 
he eals: — ^John Bull may now make his Soup " secundum 
oriem^^^ and save his principal viscera a great deal of 
trouble. 

*»* In the following Receipts we have directed the Spices* 
and Flavouring to be added at the usual time ;-'^but it would 
greatly diminish the expense^ and improve the Soups, if the 
»^gfnts employed to give them a Zest, were not put in above 
fifteen minutes before the finish, — and half the quantity of 
spice, ^e. would do, — A strcmg Heat soon dissipates the 
spirit of the Wine, and evaporates the aroma andjlavourof 
the Spices and Herbs, which are volatile in the heat of Boil- 
ing water. 

In ordering the proportions of meat, — butter, — ^wine, 
&c. — the proper quantity is set down, and less will not do : 
— we have carried Economy quite as for as possible without 
^^ spoiling the Broth for a halfpenny worth of salt, ^* 

I conclude these remarks, with observing, that some per- 
sons imagine that Soup tends to relax the Stomach — so far 
from being prejudicial, we consider the moderate use of such 
liquid nourishment to be highly salutary. — Does not our food 
and drink, even though cold, become in a few minutes a 
kind of warm Soup in the stomach ? — and, therefore. Soup, 
if not eaten too hot, or in too great a quantity, and of proper 
quality, is attended with great advantages, especially to those 
who drink but little. 

* These Economists recommend to be pounded ; they certainly go 
fcrther, as they call it ;— but we think they go too far, for tb«y go 
^biOQgfa the sieve, and make the soup grouty.

It is of as much importance that the Cook should know

that it should be sent up of proper complexion, and nicely 
frothed. 

In this Chapter we shall endeavour to introduce to lier all 
the Materials * which give flavour in iS5arucc, which is the 
Essence ofSoup^ and intended to contain more relish in a 
Tech-spoonful^ than the former does in a Tahk-spoonfuL 

We hope to deserve as much praise from the Economist^ 
—as we do from the Boii Vivant ; as we have taken great 
pains to introduce to him the methods, of making Substitutes 
for those ingredients, which are always expensive, and 
often not to 'be had at all. Many of these cheap articles 
ve as savoury and as salutary as the dearer ones, and those 
who have large feroilies, and limited incomes, will, no 
doubt, be glad to avail therjnselves of theqj.

this Book to diminish the expense, or increase the pleasures 
of Hospitality, — he will find all the information that was to

be obtained up to 1826 communicated in the most unreserved 
and intelligible manner. 

A great deal pf the Elegance of Cookery, depends upon 
the Accompaniments to each dish being appropriate, and 
well adapted to it. 

We can assure our readers, no attention has been wanting 
on our part to render this department of the work worthy 
their perusal : — each Receipt is the faithful narrative of ac- 
tual and repeated experiments, and has received the most de- 
liberate consideration before it was here presented to them. 
It is given in the most circumstantial manner, and not in 
the technical and mysterious langue^e former writers on 
these subjects seem to have preferred ; by which their direc- 
tions are useless and unintelligible to all tvho have not regu- 
larly served an apprenticeship at the Stove. I 

Thus, instead of accurately enumerating the Quantities, 
and explaining the process of each Composition, tfiey order 
a ladleful of Stocky a pint of Consomme, and a spoonful of 
CuUisy—Bs if a Private Family Cook had always at hand a 
soup-ketlle full of Stocky a store of Consomme, and the 
larder oi Albion .Houses and the Spoons ond Pennyworths 
were the same in all ages. 

It will be to very littie purpose I have taken so much pains 
to teach how to manage Koasts and Boils, if a Cook cannot 
or will not make the several Sauces that are usually sent up 
with them. 

/The most homely fare may be made relishing, and the 
oiost excellent and independent, improved by a well made 
Sauce ;* — as the most perfect Picture may, by being well var- ,' 
nished. ^ 

We have, therefore, endeavoured to give the plainest di- 



* " It is the duty of a good Suuce," says the editor of the Almanadk 
des GourtnandSt (vol. v. page 6,) ** to insiDuate itself all round and 
about the maxillary glands, and imperceptibly a^valien into activity 
each ramification of the Organs of Taste: if not sufficietiUy savour} , 
it cannot produce tbii eflect, and if too piquante, it will par'tlyse, in- 
stead of exciting, those delicious titillations of tongue, and vibrations of

rections, how to produce, with the least trouble and expense* 
possible — all the various compositions the English kitchen 
affords for the amusement of honest John Bull,— and hope 
to present such a wholesome and palatable variety as will 
suit all tastes and all pockets, so that a Cook may give satis- 
saction in all families : the more combinations of this sort 
she is acquainted with, the better she will comprehend the 
management of every one of them. 

We have rejected some Outlandish FarragoeSf from a con- 
viction they were by no means adapted to an English palate, 
if they have been received into some English books, for the 
sake of swelling the volume,f we believe they will never be 
received by an Englishman's stomach, unless for the reason 
they were admitted into the Cookery book ; i. e, because he 
has nothing else to put into it. 

However " les pompeuses Bagatelles de la Cuisine MaS"

these, both Epicures and EcoDoroL«ts, will avail themselves of the ad- 
vantage now given them, of preparing at home. 

By the help of these, many Dishes may be dressed in half the usual 
Time, — and with half the Trouble and Expense,— «nd flavoured and 
finished with much more certainty, than by the common methods. 

A small portion of the Time whicb young Ladies sacrifice to tortur- 
ing the strings of their Piano Forte, employed in obtaining Domestic 
Accomplishments — might not make them worse wives, or less agree- 
able Companions to their Husbands. This was the opinion 200 yeais 
ago. 

« To speak then of the Knowledge which belong unto our British 
Housewife — I hold the most principal, to be a perfect skill in Cookery: 
Shee that is utterly ignorant therein, may not, by the Lawes of Mrict 
u-stice, challenge the freedom of Marriage, because indeede Shee can 
perform but half her vow — Shee may love and obey, but she cannot 
cherish and keepe her Husband.'*— G. Ma rkham's English Hottseunfey

Industry of a Husband,

inor the substance to pursue the shadpwr, prefer wonderfol 
and whimsical metamorphoses, and things extravagantly ez* 
pensive, to tljose which are intrinsically excellent, — in whose 
mouth Mutton can hardly hope for a welcome, unless ac- 
companied by Fenison Sauce j or a Rabbit any chance for 
a race down the Red Lane, without assuming the form of ^ 
Frog or a ^ider ;— or Pork, without being either *^ Goosi' 
fied'^ or ** Lamhifiedy^ (see No. 51), and Game and Poul- 
try in the shape of Crawfish or Hedgehogs. 

These Travesties rather show the patience than the science 
of the Cook, — ^and the bad taste of those who prefer such 
Baby-tricks * to old English nourishing and substantial plain 
Cookery. 

I could have made this the biggest Bookf with half the 
trouble it has taken me to make it the best ;— -Concentratiofi 
and Perspicuity have been my aim. 

As much pains have been taken in describing, in the most 
intelligible manner, how to make, in the easiest, most agree- 
able, and economical way, those Common SaiLces that daily 
contribttte to the comfort of the Middle ranks of Society ; as, 
in directing the preparation of those extravagant and elabo- 
rate double relishes, the most ingenious and accomplished 
" Officers of the Mouth " have invented for the amusement 
of profound Palaticians, and thorough-bred Grands (rottr- 
mands of the first magnitude : — ^these we have so reduced the 
trouble and expense of making, as to bring them within the 
reach of moderate fortunes ; still preserving all that is vain- 
able of their taste and qualities ; so ordering them, that they 
may delight the Palate, without disordering the Stomach ; by 
leaving out those inflammatory ingredients which are only fit 
for an *' iron throat, and adamantine bowels," and those 
costly materiab, which no rational being would destroy, for 
the viranton purpose of merely giving a fine name to the com-

positiois they enter into, to whose excellence they contri- 
bate nothing else ; — for instance, consuming Two Partrids:es 
to make sauce for One ;-^half a pint of Game Gravy (No. 
329,) will be infinitely more acceptable to the unsophisti- 
cated appetite of Englishmen, for whose proper and rational 
recreation we sat down to compose these Receijpts— whose 
approbation, we have done our utmost to deserve, by devot<* 
idg much ^me to the business of the Kitchen ; and by re- 
peating the various processes that we thought admitted of the 
smallest im provement. 

We shall be fully gratified : if our Book is not bought up 
with quite so much avidity by those high bred Epicures, 
who are unhappily so much more nice than wise, that they 
cannot eat any thing dressed by an English Cook,— and vote 
it barbarously unrehned and intolerably ungenteel, to endure 
the sia;ht of the best bill of fare that can be contrived, if 
written in the vulgar tongue of Qld England.* 

Let your Sauces each display a decided character ; send 
up your PLAIN Sauces f Oyster ^ Lobster, Sfc.J as pure as 
possible ;~</i^ should only teisteofthe materials from whidi 
tkeif take their name. 

The imagination of roost Cooks, is so incessantly on the 
hoat for a Relish, — that they soem to think, they camnot 
make sauce sufficiently savoury, without putting into it 
every thing that ever was eaten ; — ^and supposing every 
addition must be an improvement, they frequently over- 
po'wer the natural flavour of their plain Sauces, by over- 
loading them- with salt and spices, &c. : — but, remember, 
these will be deteriorated by any addition, save only just salt 
enough to awaken the Palate — the Lover of " Fiquanee'^ 



* Though sdTrte of thft5!e p'^ople seem at last to have found out, — that 
, an EngUsbman's liead may be as fall of gravy as a Frenchman's,— >aDd 
willing to give the preference to native talent, retain an English man 
or woman as prime minister of their kitch^ ; still they teem ashamed 
toooofets it,hnd commonly insist as a "sine quA non" that their 
K|^fa domestics- should understand the ^* parlez-vout ;*' and not- 
wittstamiinr they are perfectly initiated in all the minutie of the Phi-

and Compound Flayours, may have recourse to ** iAc Maga* 
zine of Taste,'' (No. 463.) 

On the contrary, of Compound Sauces: — the ingre- 
dients should be so nicely proportioned, that no one be pre-' 
dominant ;— so that, from the equal union of the combined 
flavours, such a fine mellow mixture is produced, , whose 
very novelty cannot fail of being acceptable to the persevering 
Gourmand, if it has not pretensions to a permanent place at 
his table. 

An ingenious Cook will form as endless a variety of these 
compositions as a Musician with his seven* notes,— or a 
Painter with his colours ; — ^no part of her business offers so 
fair and frequent an opportunity to display her abilities — 
Sp'icfs, Herbs, &c. are often very absurdly and injudi- 
ciously jumbled together. 

Why have Clove and Allspice,— or Mace and Nutmeg in 
the same sauce, — or Marjoram, Thyme, and Savory:— or 
Onions, Leeks, Eshallots, and Garlick : — one will very well 
supply the place of the other, and the frugal Cook may save 
something considerable by attending to this, to the advantage 
of . her employers, and her own time and trouble. — ^You 
might as well, to make Soup, order one quart of water from 
the Thames, another from the JVcw River, a third from 
Hampslead, and a fourth from Chelsea, with a certain por- 
tion of Spring and Rain Water-. 

In many of our Receipts, we have fallefi in with the 
fashion of ordering a mixture of Spices, &c., which the 
above hint will enable the culinary student to correct. 

" Pharmacy is now much more simple, — Cookery 
may be made so too. A Prescription which is now com- 
pouxfeded with five ingredients, had formerly fifty in it — 
people begin to understand, that the Materia Medica is little 
more than a collection of Evacuantsand Stimuli.'' — BosweWs

." To fry and fricasee, his way's most neat, 
For be compouDds a thousand sorts of meat.'* 

To become a perfect Mistress of the art of cleverly ex- 
tracting and combining Flavours, * besides the gift of a. good 
Taste, requires all the experience and skill of the most ac- 
complished Professor, and especially, — an intimate acquaint- 
ance with the Palate she is working for. . . 
Send your Sauces to table as Hot as possible. 
Nothing need be more unsightly, than the Surface of a 
Sauce in a frozen state, or garnished with grease on the 
top ; — the best way to get rid of this, is to pass it through 
a Tammis or Napkin previously soaked in cold water; the 
coldness of the napkin will coagulate the Fat, and only 
suffer ihe pure gravy to pass through; — if any paitioks 
of Fat remain^ take them off by applying filtering paper^ aft 
blotting paper is applied to Writing. 

Let your Sauces boil up after you put in Wine, Anchovy, 
or Thickening, that their flavours may be well blended 
with the other ingredients f: and keep in mind, that the 
*< chef-d'cBuvre** of Cookery, — is to entertain the. Mouth 
without offending the Stomach. 

N. B. Although I have endeavoured to give the particular 
quantity of each ingredient used in the following Sauces, 
as they are g^^nerally made, — ^still the Cook's judgment 
must direct her to lessen or increase either of the mgre- 
dients, according to the taste of those she works for, and 
will always be on the alert to ascertain what are the fevourite 
Accompaniments desired with each dish. See Advice to 
Cooks, page 48. 

* If your palate becomes dull by repeatedly tasting, the best way to 
refresh it, is to wash your month well with millc. 

t Before you put Kggs or Cream into a Sauce, have all your other 
ii^redieuts well boiled, and the sauce or soup of proper tliickness,— 
because neither eji^gs nor cream will contribute to thiclcen it.— After 
you have put them in, do not set the stewpan on the stove again,-^ut 
kold it over the fire, aa 1 shake it round one way till the sauce is ready. ^

only the best superfine Velvet taper corks. 

Economy in Corks is extremely unwise, — in order to save 
a mere trifle, in the price of the cork, you run the risk of 
losine the vsduable article it is intended to preserve. 

It IS a Vulgcar Error y that a bottle must be well stopped, 
when the cork is forced down even with the mouth of it, it 
13 rather a sign that the Cork is too small, and it should be 
re-drawn and a larger one put in.

Half a pound of black resin, same quantity of red seaKng 
wax, quarter oz. bee's wax, melted in an earthen or iron pot;

till all is melted and fit for use. Red wax, lOd. per lb.

things that you wish to keep a long time, which without

CHAPTER IX. 

MADE DISHES. 

Undee this general head we range our Receipts for 
Hashes, — Stews, — and RAcotrs,* &c.; of these there 
ire a great mnltitnde, affording the ingenious Cook an ia- 
exhaustible store of variety:— in the French kitchen they, 
count upwards of 600, and are daily inventing new on^s. 

We have very few ^neral observations to make, s^ter 
whajt we haye already said in the two preceding Chapters on; 
— Sauces^ — SoupSt ^c, which apply to the present chapter, 
as they form the principal part of the accompaniment of 
most of these dishes. In fact, Made Dishes are nothing 
more than Meat, — ^Poultry (No. 530,) or Fish (No. 14^ 
158, or 164,) stewed very gently till they are tender, with a 
thickened Sauce poured over them. 

Be careful to trim off all the Skin^ Gristle, Sfc. that will 
not be eateUyand shape nandsomely, atidofeven thickness, the 
various articles which compose your Made Dishesy-^lAs is 
sadly neglected by common Cooks, — only Stew them tUl 
they are just tender, and do not do them to rags. — ^Therefore, 
tokat you prepare the Day before it is to be eaten, do not do 
quite enough the first day. 

We have given Receipts for the most easy and simple way 
to make Hashes, &c« Those who are well skilled m Culi- 
nary arts, can dress up things in this way, so as to be as 

* Sauce for Ragouts, Ac, should be thickened till it i« of the eoo- 
sisteoce of good rich Cream, that it may adhere to whatever it is poured 
Offer. When you have a large dinner to dress, keep ready mixed some 
fine sifted Flour and water well nibbed together till quite smooth, and 
about as thick as Butter. See (No. 2ST.)

agreeable as they were the first time they were cooked ; — but 
Hashing is a very bad mode of Cookery^ if Meat has been 
done enough the first time it is dressed, — a second dressing 
will divest it of all its nutritive juices, and if it can be smug« 
gled into the sipmach by bribing the Palate with piquanU 
Sauce, it is at the hazard of an Indigestion, &c. 

I promise those who do me the honour to put my Receipts 
into practice, that they will find that the most nutritious ^d 
truly elegant dishes, are neither the most difficult to dress, 
the most expensive, or the most indigestible ; — ^in those com- 
positions. Experience will go far to diminish Expense; — 
Meat that is too old or too tough for Roasting f ^c, may by 
gentle Stewing be rendered savoury and tender'^i^ some of 
our Receipts do differ a little from those in former Cookery 
Books, let it be remembered we have advanced nothing in 
this work that has not been tried, aiid experience has proved 
correct. 

N.B. See (No. 483] an Ingenious and Economical System 
of French Cookery, written at the recjuest of the Editor 
by ian accomplished English Lady^ which will teach you 
how to supply your table with elegant little Made Dishes^

Bfee/BoHiY/u— (No. 5.) 

la plain English, is understood to mean Boiled Beef; but 
its culinary acceptation, in the French Kitchen, is fresh beef 
dressed without boiling, and only very gently simmered by H 
slow fire. 

English Cooks have seldom any notion, that good Soup 
can be made without destroying a great deal of MfiAT ;* 
however, by a judicious regulation of the Fire, and a vigilant 
attendance on the Soup kettle, this may be accomplished — 
you shall have a tureen of such Soup as will satisfy the most 
fastidious Palate, and the Meat make its appearance at table, 
at the same time, in possession of a full portion of nutritious 
succulence. 

This requires nothing more than to Stew the meat very 
thttJy^ fimtead of keeping the pot boiling a gallops as oonu 
mon Cooks too commonly do J — and to take it up as soon as 
it M done enough. See " Soup and BouiU^^ (No. 238,) 
« ^hin of Beef Stewed^' (No. 493,) " Scotch Barley Broth'* 
(No* 204). . 

Meat cooked in this manr^r, affords much more nourish- 
inent than it does dressed in the common way, is easy of 

digestion in proportion as it is tender, and an invigorating

Life in repair by good Eating, that they require little or no

This accounts for that *^ toujours gaif"* and happy equi-

To SALT Mbat. — (No. 6.) 

In the. Summer season, especially. Meat is frequently 
Spoiled by the Cook forgetting to take out the Kernels ; one 
In the udder of a round of Beef, in the fat in the middle of 
the Round, those about the thick end of the Flank, &c.: if 
these are not taken out, all the Salt in the world will not 
keep the Meat. 

The Art of Salting, Meat, is to rub in the Salt tho- 
toughly and evenly into every part, and to fill all the holes 
full of Salt where the kernels were taken out, and where tHe 
Butcher's skewers were. , 

A Round of Beef of 25 pounds will take a pound and 

' a half of Salt to be rubbed in all at first, and requires to be 

turned and nibbed every day with the Brine ; it will be 

ready for dressing in four or five days,* if you do not wish 

it very salt. 

In Summer, the sooner Meat is salted nfter it is killed the 
bietter, and care must be taken to defend it from the flies^ 

In Winter, it will eat the shorter and tenderer, if kept a 
few days (according to the temperature of the weather) until 
its fibre has become- short and tender, as these changes do 
not take place after it has been acted upon by the Salt^

In Froil'ii weather^ take care the Meat is not {ro^en^ and 
warm the Salt in a Frying-pan. The extremes of Heat * and 
C^W are equally tinlavourable for the process of Salting— 4a 
the former the meat changes before the Salt ean affect it,-^ 
ill the latter it is so hardened, and its juices are so congealed* 
that the Salt cannot penetrate it 

If you wish it Red, rub it first with SaUpetre^ in the pro- 
poriion of half an ounce and the like quantfty of moist su^r 
to a pound of common Salt, see Satourt Salt Bv£t 
(No. 496.) ^ 

You may impregnate Meat with a yery agreeable Vegeta* 
ble Flavour, bf pounding some Sweet Herbs (No; 459) and 
an Onion with the Sak ; you may male it still more relishm 
ing by adding a rutle Zest (No. 255), or Savomy Smcer 
(No. 457.) 

To Pickle Meat. 

"Six pounds of Salt, one pound of Sugar, and four ounces 
of Saltpetre, boiled with four gallons of water, skimmed, 
and allowed to cool, forms a very slron? pickle, which 
will preserve any Meat completely immersed in it. To ef- 
fect this, which is essential, either a heavy board or a flat 
stone must be laiii ^pon the meat The same pickle may be 
used repeatedly, provided it be boiled up occasionally wiib 
additional Salt to restore its strength, diminished by the 
combination of part of the Salt with the meat, and by the 
dilution of the pickle by the juices of the meat extracted. 
By boiling, the Albumen, which would cause the pickle to 
spoil, is coagulated and rises in the form of scum, which 
must be carefully removed," — See Supplement to Encyclop^ 
Britan, vol. iv. p. 340. 

Meat kept immersed in pickk gains weight. In one ex- 
periment, by Messrs. Donkm and Gamble, there was a gain 
of three per cent^ and in another of two and a half; but in 
the common way of salting, when the meat is not immersed 
in pickle there is a loss of about one pound, or one and a

An H*bone of 10 or 12 pounds weight will require about 
three-quarters of a pound of Salt and an ounce of Moist 
Sugar to be well rubbed into it ;-»it will be ready in four or 
five days, if turned and rubbed every day. 

The Time Meat requires SaUingy depends upou^ the 
Weight of it, and how much Salt is used, and if it be rubbed 
in with a heavy handy it will be ready much sooner than if 
only lightly rubbed. 

N.B. Dry the Salt and rub it with the Sugar in a 
mortar. 

Pork requires a longer time to cure (in proportion to its 
weight) than Beef: a I^eg of Pork should be in Salt eight or 
ten days ; turn it and rub it every day. 

Salt. Meat should be well wcLshed before it is Boiled, espe- 
cially if it has been in Salt long, that the Liquor in which 
the meat is boiled, may not be too Salt to make Soup of. 
(No. 218, &c.) and (No. 555.) 

If it has been in Salt a long time, and you fear that it will 
be too. Salt, wash it well in cold water, and soak it in luke- 
warm water for a couple of hours ; — if it is very Salt, lay it 
in water the night before you intend to dress it. 

A Round of Salted Beef.^ (No. 7.) 

As this is too large for a moderate family, we shall write 
Erections for the dressing half a round : get the Tongue side* 

Skewer it up tight and round, and tie a fillet of broad tape

Put it into plenty of cold water, and carefully catch the'

moTed, and then put the boiler on one side of the fire, to 
keep simmering slowly till it is done. 

Haifa round of 151bs. will take about three hours — if it 
^^igbs more, give it more time.

H^Bone of Beef (No. B*) 

Is to be managed in exactly the same manner as the 
Round, but will be sooner boiled, as it is not so solid: an 
H-bone of 201bs. will be enough in about four hours, — of 
lOlbs. in three hours, more or less, as the weather is hotter 
or colder. Be sure the boiler is big enough to i 3w it 
plenty of water-room ; let it be well covered with water, set 
the pot' on, one side of the fire to boil p:ently ; if it boils quick 
at first, no art can make it tender after ; the slower it boils^ 
the better it will look^ atid tJie tenderer it will be. The same

plenty of Carrots, as cold Carrots are a general favourite with

Requires more time than any meat» If you buy your Port, 
ready salted^^zsk how many days it Ikis been in salt, — if many, 
— it will require to be soaked in water for six hours before you 
dress it. When you cook it, wash and scrape it as clean 
as possible; when delicately dressed, it is a favourite dish 
with almost every body ; take care it does not Boil fast ; 
if it does, the Knuckle will break to pieces, before tlie thick 
part of the meat is warm throi^h ; a LEG of seven pounds 
takes three hours and a half very slow simmering. Skim 
your pot very carefully, and when you take the meat out of 
the Boiler, scrape it clean. 

Some sagacious Cooks (who remember, to how many 
more nature has given Eyes, than she has given Tongues 
and' Brains,) when Pork is boiled, score it in Diannioods, 
and take out every other square — and thus, present a re^ 
tainer to the Eye to plead for them to the palate, — ^but, thi$ 
is pleasing the Eye at the expense of the Palate. A Legofnice 
Pork nicely salted, and nicely boiled, is as nice a cold relish 
as cold Ham— especially if, instead of cutting into the middle 
when hot, and so letting out its juices, you cut it at the 
Knuckle — slices broiled, as (No. 487,) are a good Luncheon, 
or Supper. — To make Pease Pudding, and Peas Soup ex- 
tempore, see N. B. to (Nos. 218 and 555.) 

Mem. — Some Persons who sell Pork ready Salted have a 
silly trick of cutting the Knuckle in two— we suppose that this 
is done to save their salt, but it lets all the Gravy out of the 
Leg, and unless you 1>oil your Pork merely for the sake of 
the Pot-Liquor, which in this case receives all the goodness 
and strength of the meat. — ^Friendly Reader, your Oracle 
caudons you to Buy no Leg of Pork which is slit at the ' 
Knuckle. 

If Pork is not done enough, nothing is more disagreeable ;

this will take full twenty minutes ;-r-but the heart, liver, 
and lights, will be done enough in ten, when they are to be 
taken out, and minced fine. 

Put them all together into a Stewpan with some Gravy, 
thicken it with a little butter rolled in flour, season it with a 
little pepper and salt, and set it over a gentle fire to simmer 
for five minutes, frequently shaking them about. 

While this is doing, have a thin ^lice of Bread toasted

Kceipt, and put it before the fire for few minutes ; it must

thick, will take more. 

Obs, 2See (Nos. 526 and 527) : wheti only a little Bacon 
is wanted^ these are the best ways of dressing it. 
. The boilii^ of Bacon, is a very simple subject to comment 
upon, — but our main object is — to teach common Cooks 
the art of dressing common food in the best manner. 

Bacon is sometimes as salt as salt can make it ; therefore 
before it is boiled, it must be soaked in warm water for an 
hour or two, changing the water once ; then pare off the 
nisty and smoked part, trim it nicely on the imderside, and 
scrape the rind as clean as possible. 

Mem. Bacon is an extravagant article in Housekeeping'^^ 
there is often twice as much dressed as need be, — when it is 
sent to table as an accompaniment to boiled Poultry or Veal, 
d pound and a half is plenty for a dozen people. A good 
German Sausage is a very economical substitute for Bacon— 
or fried Pork Sausages, (No. 87). 

Haniy (No. 14.) 

Though of the Bacon kind, has been so altered and 
hardened in the curing, that it requires still more cai-e. 

Ham is generally not half soaked, — as salt as Brine and 
hard as Flint ; and it would puzzle the Stomach of an Ostrich 
to digest it. 

Mem. — The Salt, Seasoning, and Smoke, which preserve 
It before it is eaten, prevent its solution after, and unless it 
^ very long, and very gently stewed, the strongest stomach 
viU have a tough Job to extract any nourishment from it. 
" it IS a very dry Westphalia Ham, it must be soaked, 
according to its age and thickness, from 1 2 to 24 hours ;— 
for a Green Yorkshire or Westmoreland Ham, from four to 
fight hours; will be sufficient. Lukewarm water will soften 
It much sooner than cold — when sufficiently soaked, trim it 
nicely on the underside — and pare off all the rusty and 
smoked parts till it looks dehcately clean.

small Family, where a Ham will last a week or ten days, it 
is best Economy not to cut it till it is cold-;— it will be infi- 
nitely more iuicy. 

Pull off the Skin carefully, and preserve it as whole as 
possible, it will form an excellent covering to keep the Ham 
moist : — when you have removed the skin, rub some Bread 
Raspings through a Hair-sieve, or grate a crust of Bread, put 
it into the perforated cover of the Dredging box, and shake 
it over it, or glaze it ; trim the Knuckle with a fringe of cut 
writing paper. You may garnish with Spinage, or Turnips, 
&c 

Obs. — To Pot Ham (No. 509), is a much more useful 
and economical way of disposing of the remains of the joint, 
than making Essence of it (No. 35^). To make Soup of the 
Liquor it is boiled in, see N.B. to (No. 555). 

Tqngue. — (No. 15.) 

A Tongue is so hard, whether prepared by drjring or 
pickling, that it requires much more cooking than a Ham ; 
«*<^othing of its weight, takes so long to dress it properly. 

A tongue that ha^een salted and dried, should be put to 
soak, (f^ it is Ol^and very hardy 24 hours before it is 
wanted,) in plenty of water ; — a Green one fresh from the 
pickle, requires soaking only a few hours ;— put your Tongue

you can then reserve some of the inside stuffing to eat with

^ A fine Five-toed Fowl or a Capon about an hour. 

A small Turkey, an hour and a half. 

A large one, two hours or more.. 

Chickens or Fowls should be killed at least one or two 
days before they are to be dressed. 

Turkeys (especially large ones) should not be dressed till 
they have been killed three or four days at least — in Cold 
tfeqther sit or eight, — or they will neither look White nor 

eat Tender.* 

Turkeys, and large Fowls, should have the strings or 
sinews of the thighs drawn out. 

Truss them with the Ugs outwards, they are much easier 
carved* \ , . 



• Bakbr in bis Chronicle tells us the Turkey did not reach Engltod

140 BOILING. 

Fowls for BoUing shouM be chosen as white as possible !* 
if their complexion is not so hn as you wish, veil them 
in (No* 2 of No. 361) ; those which have black legs should 
be roasted. The best use of the Liver is to make Sauce 
(No. 287). 

Poultry must be well washed in warm water — ff verf 
dirty from the singeing, &c. rub them with a little white 
Soap, — ^but thoroughly rinse itoflF — before you put them into 
thePoU 

Make a good and clear fire : set on a clean pot, with pure 
and clean water, enough to well cover the Turkey, &c.; 
the slower it boils, the whiter and plumper it will be. — 
When there rises any scum, remove it ; the common method 
of some (who are more nice than wise) is to wrap them up 
in a cloth, to prevent the scum attaching to them ; which, if 
it does, by your neglecting to skim the pot, there is no get- 
ting it off afterwards, and the Poulterer is blamed for the 
fault of the Cook. 

If there be Water enough, and it is attentively scummed^ 
the Fowl will both look and eat much better this way, than 
when it has been covered up in the cleanest cloth ; and the 
colour and flavour of your Poultry will be preserved in the 
most delicate perfection. 

Obs.-^Turkey deserves to be accompanied by Tongue 
(No. 15), or Ham (No. 14) : if these are not come-at-able, 
don't forget Pickled Pork (No. 11), or Bacon and greens 
(Nos. 83, 526, and 527), or Pork Sausages (No. 87),' 
Parsley and Biilter (No. 261) ; don't pour it over, but send 
it up in a boat ; Liver (No. 287), Egg (No. 267), or Oyster 
sauce (No. 278.) To warm cold Turkey, &c. (No. 533), 
and following. 

To Chill the Gizard and Rumpy see (No. 538). Save a 
quart of the liquor the Turkey was boiled in — this, with 
the bones and trimmings, &c. will make good gravy for a 
Hash, &c. **

Liver and Lemon sauce, (see Nos. 287 and 288.) 

N.B- It will save much trouble to the Carver, if the 
Rabbits l)e cut up in the Kitchen, into pieces fit to help at 
table, and the Head divided, and one-half laid at each end, 
and slices of Lemon and the Liver chopped very finely, laid 
on the sides of the Dish. 

At all events, cut off the Head before you send it to 
Table, — we hardly remember that the thing ever lived, if 
we don't see the Head, while it may excite ugly ideas to see 
it cut up in an attitude imitative of Life ; besides, for the 
preservation of the Head, the poor animal sometimes suffer^i 
a slower Death. 

Trtpe.*—(No. 18.) 

Take care to have fresh Tripe, cleanse it well from the 
fat, and cut it into pieces about two inches broad and fouf 
long ; put it into a stew-pan, and cover it with Milk and 
water, and let it boil sjently till it is tender. 

If the Tripe has been prepared as it usually is at the 
Tripe «hops, it will be enough in about an hour, (this 
depends upon how long it has been previously boiled at 
the Tripe shop) ; if entirely undressed^ — it will require two 
or three hours — ^according to the Age and Quality of it. 

Make some Onion sauce in the same manner as you 
do for Rabbits (No. 298), or boil (slowly by themselves) 
some Spanish, or the whitest common Onions you can get ; 
— peel them before you boil them ; when they are tender, 
which a middling-sized Onion will be in about three quar-

other instances, differs as much from that of our /at^e^ Animals, as 
Silver and Gold from the grosser metals. The superiority of Wblch

If there is more Fat than yoa think will be entien with the Meat, cut 
it off, it will make an excellent Puddino (No. 554); or clarify it, see 
(No. 84), and use it for Frying:— for those who like their meat don* 
thoroughly, and use a moderate fire for roasting, the Fat need not be 
covered with paper. 

J(f your Bee/u large, and your family small,— cut off the thin end and

about a quarter of an inch apart ; — stuff the knuckle with 
sage and onion minced fine, and a little grated bread sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, and the yolk of an Egg; see Duck 
Stuf^ng (No. 61.) 

ly^s not put it too near the Fire, — rub a little sweet Oil on 
the skin with a paste brush, or a goose feather : - this makes 
the Crackling crisper and browner than basting it with 
dripping ; and it will be a better colour than all the art of 
Cookery can make it in any other way. And this is the best 
Siray of preventing the skin from blisterii^ — ^which is prin- 
ci|Kdly occasioned by its being put too near the fire. 

Leg of Pork roasted iviihou* the ^in^ commonly called

from two to three hours to roast it thoroughly,^»npt exactly 
according to its weight, but the thickness of the meat upoa 
it, which varies very much : — lay the thick end nearest to the 
Fire. 

A proper bald Spare^Rib of eight pounds weight, (so 
called because almost all the Meat is pared off,) with a steady 
fire, will be done in an hour and a quarter; — there is so 
little meat on a bald Spare^Rib, that if you have a large 
fierce fire, it will be burnt before it is warm through ; joint 
it nicely, and crack the Ribs across as you do Rtbs of 
Lamb. 

When you put it down to roast, dust on some flour, and 
baste it with a little butter; dry a dozen Sa^ leaves, and 
rob them through a hair sieve, and put them mto the top of 
a peppej: box, and al)out a quarter of an hour before the 
meat is done, baste it with butter, dust the pulverized Sage, 
or the wvoury. powder in (No. 51), or sprinkle with Duck 
Stuffing (No. 61.) 

Obs. — Make it a general rule, never to pour grevy over 
any thing that is roasted ; by so doing, the dredging* &c. is 
washed oS^ and it eats insipid. 

Some people carvB a Spare-Rib hf. cutting out in slices 
the thick part at the bottom of the bOoes : when this meat is 
cut av^y, the bones may be easily separated, and are 
esteemed very sweet picking. 

Applesauce (No. 304), Mashed Potatoes (No* 106), and 
good Mustard (No. 370), are indispensable* 

Loin — (No. 54.) 

Of five pounds, must be kept at a good distance from the 
fire on account of the Crackling^ and will take about two 
hours — ^if very iat, half an hour longer. 

StuflP it with Duck Stuffing (No. 378). Score the skin in 
stripes, about a quarter of an Inch apart, and rub it with 
Salad Oil, as directed in (No. 50). You may sprinkle over

good fire will roast it in two hours ; if not parted, three 
hours. 

N.B. Chines are generally salted and boiled. 

A Sucking Pig 9* — (No. 56.) 

Is in prime order for the spit, when about three weeks old. 

It loses \.wrt of its goodness every hour after it is killed;— 
if not quite fresh, no art can make the CrackUng crisp. 

To be in perfection, it should be killed in tlie morning, to 
he eaten at dinner; — it requires very careful roastinjj. A 
sucking Pig, like a young Child, must not be left for aa 
instant. 

The ends, must have much more fire than the middle ; 
for this purpose, is contrived an Iron to hang before the 
middle part, called a Pig iron. If you have not this, use a 
common flat Iron, or keep the fire fiercest at the two ends. 

For the Stuffing, take of the crumb of a stale loaf about 
five ounces ; rub it through a cullender ; mince fine a hand* 
ful of sage, {i. e\ about two ounces,) and a large onion, 
(about an ounce and a half ;f ) mix these together with an 
egg, some pepper and salt, and a bit of butter as big as 
an egg; fill the belly of the pig with this, and sew it up; 
lay it to the fire, and baste it with Salad Oil till it is quite 
done ; — do not leave it a moment ; it requires the most vigi- 
lant attendance. 

Roast it at a^ clear brisk fire, at some distance. To gain 
the praise of Epicurean Pig-Eaters, the Crackling must 
be nicely crisped and delicately lightly browned, without 
being either blistered or burnt,

A small three«)veek8 old Pig will be enough^ in about an 
hour and a half. ' 

tJefore you take it from the Fire, cut ofFthe head, and part 
that and the body down the middle ; chop the Brains very 
fine with some boiled Sage leaves, and mix them with good 
Veal gravy, made as directed in (No. 192,) or BeefGrav^ 
(No. 329,) or what runs from the Pig when you cut its head 
off. Send up a tureenful of Gravy (No. 329,) besides. 
Corrant Sauce is still a favourite with some of the Old 
School. 

Lay your Pig back to back in the dish, with one half of 
the head on each side, and the Ears, one at each end, which 
you miist take care to make nice and crisps or you will get 
scolded, and deservedly, as the silly fellow was, who bought 
his wife a pig with only one ear. 

When you cut off the Pettitoes, leave the skin Ions: round 
the ends of the legs. When you first lay the Pig before the 
fire, rub it all over with Fi-esh Butter or Salad Oil, ten 
minutes after, and the skin looks dry— dredge it well with 
flour all over — let it remain on an hour — ^then rub it off with 
a soft cluth. 

N. B. A Pig is a very troublesome subject lo Roast, most 
persons have them Baked ; serid a quarter of a pound of ' 
butter, and beg the baker to baste it well. 

Turkey^ Turkey Poults, and other Poultry, (No. 57.) 

A Fowl, and a Turkey, require the same management at 
the fire, only the latter will take longer time. 

Many a Christmas dinner has been spoiled, by the Turkey 
having been hunsj up in a cold larder, becoming thoroughly 
firozen i^^ack Frost has ruined the reputation of many a 
Turkey-Roaster : — therefore, in very cold fVeather^ remember 
the JVbte in the 5th page of the 2d chapter of the Rudimem s

writing paper, light k, and thoroughly singe the Turkey all 
over, turning it ahout over the flame. 

TuRKiSYs, Fowls, and Capons, have a much better ap- 
pearance, if, instead of trussing them with the Legs close to- 
gether, and the f(*et cut off, the Legs are extended on each side 
of the bird, and the toes only cut off, with a skewer through 
each foot, to keep them at a proper distance. 

Be careful, when you draw it, to preserve the Liver, and 
not to break the ChdUhag^ as no washing will take off the 
bitter taste it gives, where it once touches. 

Prepare .a nice clear brisk fire for it. 

Make Stuffing according to (No. 374, or 376,)— stuff it 
under the breast, where the craw was taken out, and make 
some into Balls, and boil or fry them, and lay them round 
the dish ; — they are handy to help, and you can then reserve 
some of the inside stuffing to eat with the cold Turkey, Or to 
enrich a Hash (No. 533.) 

Score the Gizzard^ dip it into the Yolk of an Egs: or melted 
batter, and sprinkle it with salt and a few grains of Cayenne, 
put it under one Pinion, and the Liver under the other, cover 
the Liver with buttered Paper, to prevent it from gettii^ 
hardened or burnt. 

When you first put a Turkey down to roast, dredge it with 
Flour, then put about an ounce of Butter into a basting ladle, 
and as it melts, baste the bird therewith. 

Keep it at a distance from the fire for the first half hour, 
that it may warm gradually, then put it nearer, and when it is 
plumped up, and the steam draws in toward the fire, it46 
nearly enough, then dredge it lit^htly with flour, and put a 
bit of butter into your basting Is^le, and as it melts, oaste 
the turkey with it ; this will raise a finer Froth than can be 
produced by using the fat out of the pan. 

A very large Turkey ^ will require about three hours, to roast 

it thoroughly ; a middling sized one^ of eight or ten pounds 

(which is rar nicer eating than the very large one,) about 

.two hours ; a Small one may be done in an hour and a half. 

Ta&KEY Poults are of various sizes, and will take about 
an hour and a half, they should be trussed with their le^ 
twisted under like a Duck, and t^lHdunder the wing like 
a Pheasant. ^^^^^ 



nOASTINO. T5d 

Fried Pork SAasAOBS (No. 87,) are a very savonry and 
fiivourite accompaniment to either roasted, or boiled Poultry. 
A Turkey, thus garnished, is called ** an Aldbrman in

Sausage meat is sometimes u?<ed as stuffing* instead of the 
ordinary Forcemeat (No. 376,) &c. 

Mem. — If you wish a Turkey , especially a very large one^ to 
he tender 9 never dress it till at least four or five days (in cold 
weather, eight or ten) after it has been killed. ** No man 
who understands good living, will say, on such a day I will 
eat that Turkey — but will hang it up by four of the large tail 
feathers, and when, on paying his morninj^ visit to the Larder, 
he finds it lying upon a cloth, prepared to receive it when it 
falls, that day let it be cooked." 

Hen Turkeys, are preferable to Cocks for whiteness and 
tendemessy and the small fleshy ones with black legs, are most 
esteemed.

plump out the fowl, which must be tied closely (both at the 
neck and rump,) to keep in the stuffing. 

Some cooks put the Liver of the Fowl into this forcemeat, 
and others mince it and pound it, and rub it up with flour aod 
melted butter, see (ISo. 287.) 

When the Bird is stuffed and trussed, score the Gizzard 
nicely, dip it into melted butter, let it drain, and then seascxi 
it with Cayenne and Salt, put it under one pinion, and the 
UvcT under the other — to prevent it getting hardened ot 
scorched, cover them with double paper buttered. 

Take care that your Roasted poultry be well browned ; it 
is as indispensable, that roasted poultry should have a rich 
Brown complexion, as boiled poultry should have a delicate 
White one. 

Obs. " The Art of fattening Poultry for the London Jfor- 
ket, is a considerable branch of rural Economy in some con- 
venient situations, and consists in supplying them with plenty 
of healthy food, and confining them ; and Ducks and Greese 
must be prevented from goin^into water, which prevents them 
from becoming fat, and they also thereby acquire a rancid fishy 
taste. — They are put into a dark place, and crammed with a 
paste made of Barley Meal, mutton suet, and some treacle or 
coarse Sugar mixed with milk, and are found toj. be completely 
ripe in a fortnight. If kept longer, the fever that is induced 
by this continued state of repletion, renders them red and 
unsaleable, and frequently kills them*" — ^But Exercise is as 
indispensable to health of Poultry as other creatures,— with- 
out it, the fat will be all accumulated in the cellular mem- 
brane, instead of being dispersed through its system. — See 
MouBRAY, on Breeding and Fattening Domestic Poultry, 
12mo. 1819. 

Fowls which are fattened artificially, are by some Epicures 
preferred to. those called Barn-Door ;{owls, whom we have 
heard say, that they should as soon think of ordering a 
Bam-Doorfor Dinner, as a Bam-Door Fowl. 

The Age of Poultry, makes all the difference : — nothing is 
tenderer than * a young Chicken ; few things are tourer 
than an old ^ Cock or Hen, which is only fit to make Broth.

t Althotfcth the whole is ratber too luscious for the linjrual nerves of 
the good folks of Great Brituiu, the Livers of Poultry are considered a 
very high relish by our Continental neighbours ; and the following 
directions how to procure them in perfeotioo, we copy from the Recipe 
of *• un Vieil Amateur de Banne Chtre** 

** The Liver of a Duck, or a Goose, who has submitted to the rules 
and orders that men of taste have invented for the amusement of his 
sebaceous glands, is a 5Ui)erlative exquisite to the piilnte of a Parisian 
Epicure— but, alus ! the poor goose, to produce this darling dainty, must 
endure sad torments. He must be crammed with meat, deprived of 
driiiky find kept constantly before a hot firt?-— a roiseruble martyrdom 
iodeed — and would be truly intolerable if his reflections on the conse- 
quences of his sufferings, did not afl'ord him some consolation — but the 
gIoriou<i prospect of the delightful growth of his liver, gives him courage 
and ffU|>port; and when he thinks, how speedily it will become ulmo&t 
as bie us bis Body— ^how high it will rank on the list of double relishes 
—and with what ecslacies ii will be euten by the fanciers "^e* Foies 
^rBW,"be submits to his destiny without a sigh. — The famous Strasbourg 
Pie$ are made with Liv^fs thus prepared, aud sell for an enormous 
price '* 

However incredible this ordtmnance for the obe^itation of a Goose's 
Liver may appear at first sight— will it not seem equally so to nfter 
ages, that in this enlightened countr}-, in 18)21, we encouraged a Folly 
as much greater—as its operation was more universal r— Will it be be*

it, see (No. 530.) 
For another Stuffing for Geese, see (No. 378.) 

Obs. ** Goose-feeding in the vicinity of the metropolis is 
so large a concern, that one person annually feeds for market 
upwards of 5000." ** A Goose on a farm in Scotland two 
years since, of the clearly ascertained age of 89 years, healthy 
and vigorous, was killed by a Sow while sitting over her 
Egps; it was supposed she might have lived many years, 
and her fecundity appeared to be permanent. Other Geese 
have been proved to reach the age of 70 years." — ^MoubraV 
oti Poultry^ p. 40. 

It appears in Dr. Stark's Experiments on Diet^ p. 110, 
that *' when he fed upon Roasted Goosb, he was more 
vigorous both in Body and Mind, than with any other diet." 

The Goose at MichaelmaSy is as famous, in the moutfai 
of the million, as the Minced Pie at Christmas; but, for 
those who eat with delicacy, it is by that time too M 
grovm. 

The true period, when the Goose is in its highest perfection, 
is when it has just acquired its full growth, and not begun 
to harden. If the March goose is insipid, the Michaelmas 
goose is rank; the fine time, is between both; from the 
second week in June, to the first in September ; the Leg 
is not the most tender part of a Goose. See Mock Goose

Green 6ibofe.-— (Na 60.) 

Gieese are called (Shreen^ till they are about four monthsr 
«H. 

The only difference between roasting these, and a fttll' 
grown Goose, consists in seasoning it with pepper and salt 
instead of sage and onion, and roasting it for K)rty or £fty 
minutes only. 

Obs. This is one of the least desirable of those insipid 
premature productions, which are esteemed dainties. ' 

Dttdfc.— (No.61.) 

Mind your Diick is weU cleaned, and wiped out with a 
clean cloui ; for the Stuffing take an ounce of Onion, and 
half an ounce of ^een Sage, chop them very fine, and mix 
them with two ounces, i. e, about a breakfast-cupful of 
Bread crumbs, a bit of butter about as big as a Walnut, a very 
little black pepper and salt, (some obtuse palates may require 
warming with a little Cayenne, No. 404), and the yolk of an 
egg to bind it ; mix these thoroughly together, and put into 
the Duck. For another Stuffing, see (No. 378.) From 
half 4o three-quarters of an hour, will be enough to roast it, 
according to the size : contrive to have the Feet deikatefy 
critp^ as some people are very fond of them :— to do this 
nicely you must have a sharp fire. For Sauce, Green Pease 
(No. 134), Bonne Bouche (No. 341), Gravy Sauce (No. 329), 
and Sage and Onion Sauce (No. 300.) 

To Hash or Stew Ducks, see (No. 530). 

N£. If you think the raw Onion will make too strong 
an impression upon the Palate, parboil it.-— Read Ohs^ to 
(No. 59.) 

To ensure Ducks being tender — ^in moderate weather^ kill 
them a few days before you dress them. 

Haunah of Venison. — (No. 63.) 

To preserve the Fat, make a paste of flour and water, as 
much as will cover the haunch, wipe it with a dry cloth in 
every part, rub a large sheet of paper all over with butter, 
and cover the Venison with it, then roll out the paste about 
three-quarters of an inch thick^ lay this all over the faX side; 



I6t BOABTrKQ*. 

and cover it well, with three or four sheets of strong white 
paper, and tie it securely on with packthread; haye a strong 
close fire, and baste your venison as soon as you lay it down, 
to roost (to prevent the paper and string from burning) ; it 
must be well basted all the time. 

A Buck Haunch generally weighs from 20 to 25 pounds, 
will take about four hours and a half roasting, in warm, and 
kaiger in Cold weather,— *a Haunch, of from 12 to 1 6 pounds' 
will be done in about three or three and a half. 

A quarter of an hour before it is done, the string must he 
est, and the paste carefully taken off; now baste it with 
butter, dredge it lightly with Hour, and when the froth rises, 
and it has got a very light brown colour, garnish the knuckle-^ 
bone, with a ruffle of cut writing paper, and send it up, with 
good strong (but wiseasoned) Gravy (No. 347), in one boat, 
and Currant-Jelly Sauce in the other, or Currant-Jelly in a 
side plate (not melted) : see, for Sauces (Ncs. 344, 5, 6, 
and 7.) Mem. " The AldermarCs Walk'' is the favourite 
part. 

Obs. Buck Venison is in greatest perfection from Mid- 
summer to Michaelmas; and Doe, from November to 
January., 

JVecA and Shoulder of VenUon — (No. 64.) 

Are to be managed in the same way as the haunch ; .<»ly 
they do npt require the coat or paste, and will not require so 
much time. ■ ' 

The best way to spit a neck, is to put three skeweis 
through, and put the spit between the skewers and the 
■bones. 

J faum— (No. 65.) 

Lflce a sticking Pig, should be dressed, almost as soon 
as killed. When very young, is trussed, stuflfed, and spitted 
the same way as a Hare. But ihey ar# better eating when 
of the size of a House Lamb; and are then roasted in 
quarters ; the hind quarter is most esteemed. 

They must be put down to a very quick fire, and either 
"hasted all the time they are roasting, or be covered witK 
sheets of fat bacon ; when done, baste it with butter, and

The first points of considei^tioh arc. How old is the Har^T 
and how Ions: has it been killed } When yiDung, it is easy of 
digestion, and very nourishing; — when oldj the contrary iji 
every respect. 

To ascertain the age, examine the first joint of the fbtt 
foot; you will find a small knob, if it is a Leveret, which 
disappears as it grows older ; then examine the ears ; if they 
.tear easily, it will eat tender; if they are tous:h, so will he 
the Hare, which we advise you to make into Soup (No. 341,) 
or STEW ; or jug it, see (No. 523.) 

When newly killed, the body is stiff; as it grows stak, it 
becomes limp. • . * 

As soon as you receive a Hare, take out the Liver, parboil 
it, and keep it for the stuffins:; some are very fond of it :-^ 
do not use it, if it be not quite fresh and good. Some mince 
it, and send it up as a garnish in little hillocks round the 
dish. Wipe the hare quite dry," rub the inside with pepper, 
and hang it up in a dry cool place.

To make the Stuffing, see (No. 379 :) do not make il 
too thin ; it should he of cohesive consistence : if it is. not 
sufficiently stiff, it is good for nothing: pot this into the 
helly, sew it up tight. 

Cut the neck skin to let the blood out^ or it will never 
appear to he done enough, spit it, and haste it with 
Drippings,* (or the juices of the Back will be dried up 
bftfore the upper joints of the Legs are half done,) till voa 
think it is nearly done, which a middling sized Hare 
will be in aibout an hour and a quarter. When it is al- 
most roasted enous^h, put a little bit of butter into your 
basting-ladle, and baste it with this, and flour it, and iroth 
it nicely. 

Serve it with good Gravy (No. 329,) or (No. 347,) and 
Currant-jelly. For another Stuffing, see receipt , (No. .379.) 
Some Cooks cut off the head and divide it, and lay one half 
on each side the Hare. 

Cold Roast Hare will malse excellent Soup (No. 241,)

U your iire is clear a^id sharp, thirty minutes will roast i 
young, and forty a fiill grown Rabbit. 

When you lay it down baste it with butter, and dredge itUghtly 
and carefully with dour, that you may have it frothy, and o£z 
fine light brown. Wbilethe rabbit is roasting, boil its Liven*

1B8 . HOASTIXC^. 

' Ohs.-^We believe the rarity of this biril is its Best reborn^ 
mendation ; and the character given it by an ingenioni 
French author, is just as good as it {Reserves. *^ Its flesh is 
naturally tough, and owes all its tenderness and succulence 
to the lon^ time it is kept, before it is cooked ;*' until it is 
" bden morttfiiey^^ it is uneatable.* Therefore, instead of **sas 
per col,'' suspend it by one of the long tail-feathers, and the 
Fheasant^s falling from it, is the criterion of its ripeness and 
readiness for the spit. 

Our Prefsident of the Committee of Taste, (who is indefk- 
tigahle in his endeavours to improve the Health, as well ai 
promote the Etijoyment of his fellow Students in the Scbod 
of Good Living, and to whom the Epicure, the Economist,

revision of this work, and especially for introducine that sa- 
lutary maxim in'o the Kitchen, — that '* the Salubrious is 
ever a superior consideration to the Savoury,' * and indeed, 
that the Rational Epicure only relishes the latter, when en- 
tirely subordinate to the former,) has su2:gested to us, that 
the detachment of the Feather cannot take place until the 
body of the Bird has advanced more than one degree beyond 
the state of wholesome haufgo'At^ and become •* trap morii'

N»B. Sportsmen will find the following rule of very great 
advantage to themselves and their Cooks, — ^to order their 
g^me-keepers (and dbstrvethe same themselves) to cut off a 
Claw of each Bird they kill, denoting 




the day of the week, thus ^M }i}^ ^<^ t^'C 



Cook should be particular in keeping each week's killing se- 
parate. The claws should not be cut off when the Bird is 
dressed for Table, as they serve to show the Company when 
it was killecl, and consequently how long it has been kept. 

. Mock Phe(utant—(No. 69.) . 

If you have only one pheasant, and wish for a companion 
for it, get a fine young fowl, of as near as may be the same 
size as the bird to be matched, and make game of it by truss- 
ing it like the pheasant, and dressing: it according to the 
above directions. Few persons will discover the pheasant 
from the fowl, especially if the latter has been kept four or 
five days. 

The peculiar flavour of the Pheasant (like that of other 
game) is principally acquired by long keeping. 

Guinea and Pea Fowls* — (No. 69.*) 
Are dressed in the same way as Pheasants. : ^ 

Partridges. — (No. 70.) 

Are cleaned and trussed in the same manner as a phea- 
sant, (but the ridiculous custom of tucking the legs into each 
other, makes them very troublesome to carve) ; the breast is 
so plump, it will require almost as much roasting : send up 
witn them rice sauce (No. 321*), bread sauce (No. 321), 
and good gravy (No. 329.) '^ 

*^* If you wish to preserve them longer than you think 
they will keep' good undressed^ half roast thenif they will keep 
tvDO or three days longer , or make a Pie of them.

Black Cock (No. 71), Moor Game -(No. 72), and Gv^ 

(No. 73,) 
Are^U to be dressed like partridges; the Black Cock will 
take as much as a pheasant, and Moor Qame and Grouse^las 
the partridge. Send up with them Currant-jelly and fri^ 
Bread crumbs (No. 320). 

wad Duch.—[^o. 74.) 

For roasting a Wild Duck, you must have a clear brisk 
fire, and a hot spit ; it must be browned upon the outside, 
without being sodden within. To have it well frothed, and. 
full of giUvy, is the nicety. Prepare the fire, by stirring and 
raking it just before the bird is laid down, and fifteen or 
twenty, minutes will do it in the fashionable way ; but if yon 
like it a little more done, allow it a few minutes longer ; if it 
is too much it will lose its flavour. 

For the sauce, see (No. 338) and (No. 62). 

Widgeons anrfTca^ (No. 75.) 

Are dressed exactly as the wild duck ; only that less time 
is requisite for a Widgeon, and still less for a Teaf. 

^ToocfcocX:.— (No. 76.) 

Woodcocks should not be drawn, as the trail is by the 
Lovers of " haut-goUt " considered a ** Bonne Bouche;^' truss

Obs. — ^Some Epicures like this bird very much under- 
done, and direct that — a Woodcock should be just introduced 
to the Cook, for her to show it the Fire, and then send it up 
to Table. 

Snipes,— (^o. 77.) 

mStt little from Woodcocks, unless in size ; they are to 
be dressed in the same way, but require about five minutes 
less time to roast them. 

For Sauce, see (No. 338). 

. Pigeons. — (No. 78.) 

When the pigeons are ready for roasting, if you are de- 
sired to stuff them, chop some green parsley very fine, the 
liver, and a bit of butter together, with a little pepper and 
salt, or with the stuffing ordered for a fillet of veal (No. 374), 
or (No. 375), and fill the belly of each bird with it. They 
will be enough in about twenty or , thirty minutes : send up 
Parsley and Butter (No. 261,) in the dish under them, and 
some in a boat, and garnish with crisp Parsley (No. 318), 
or Fried Bread Crumbs (No. 320), or Bread Sauce 
(No. 321), or Gravy (No. 329). 

Ohs. — When Pigeons are fresh, they have their full relish ; 
but it goes entirely ofi* with a very little keeping ; nor is it 
any way ao well preserved, as by Roasting them, — when 
they are put into a Pie, they are generally baked to rags, and 
taste more of pepper and salt than any thing else. 

A little melted butter may be put into the dish with them, 
and the gravy that runs from them will mix with it into fine 
sauce. Pigeons are in the greatest perfection from Mid- 
summer to Michaelmas, there is then the most plentiful and 
best food for them; and their finest growth is just when they 
are full feathered. When they are in the pen-feathers, they 
are flabby; when they are full grown, and have flown some 
time, they are tough. Cfame and Poultry are best when they 
have just done growing^ t. «• as soon as Nature has perfected 
her work.

This was the secret of Solomon^ the famous Pigeon-feeder 
of Turnham Green, who is celebrated by the poet Gay, when 
he says, 

" That Turnham Green, which dainty pigeons fed. 
But feeds no more, for SoUmon is dead." 

Larks, and other smaU Birds. — (No. 80.) 

These delicate little'birds are in high season in ^fovemher. 
When they are picked, gutted, and cleaned, truss them ; 
brush them with the yolk of an egg, and then roll them in 
bread crumbs ; spit them on a lark spit, and tie that on to a 
larger spit, ten or fifteen minutes at a quick fire will be enough; 
baste them with fresh butter while they are roasting, and 
sprinkle them with bread crumbs till they are well covered 
with them. 

• For the Sauce, fry some grated bread in clarified butter, 
see (No. 259), and set it to drain before the fire, that it may 
harden : serve the crumbs under the Larks when you dish 
them, and garnish them with slices of Lemon. 

Wheat^Ears.—(^o. 81.) 
Are dressed in the same way as Larks. 

Lobster.— \^o.%2.)

COOK'S ORACLE. 



FRYING. 



To Clarify Drippi7igs.—(^o. 83.) 

Put your dripping into a dean saucepan over a stove or 
-slow fire ; when it is just going to boil, skim it well, let it 
boil} and then let it stand till it is a little cooled, then poisr 
' it through a sieve into a pan. 

Obs. — ^Well cleansed Drippings^* and the fat iS^m- 

r - — ' m- 

* Mrs. Mslrob, io her Economical Cookery, page 7, tells us, sbe 
-liasasoertnned tiom actual experiments, that " the Drippings of Roast 
Meat, oomhuiied with Wheat, Flour, Oatmeal, Barley, Pease, or Pota- 
;toeStar6h, will make delicidus Soup, agieeabje and savoury to the Pa- 
)ate» and nutritive and servioeahle to the Stomach, and that while a joint 
is toasting, good Soup may be made from the drippings of the Fat, 
which is the Essence JfMeat, as seeds are of Vegetables, and impreg- 
nates Soop with the identie4il taats o/ Meaty

Fat, and in the next sentence order Butter (a much more expensive 
article) to be added — instead of iliis, wb^n any Fat appears at the top 
of your Soup or Stew, do not skim it off, but unite it with the broth 
.by means of the vegetable mucilages. Flour, Oatmeal, Ground Barley, 
or Potatoe Starch ; when suspended, the l^up is equally agreeable y> 
. the palate, and nutritive to the Stomach,'' <bc. 

^ Cooks bestow a great deal of pains to make Gravies ; they stew 
and boil lean meat for hours, and after all their Cookery, tastes more 
of Pepper and Salt than any thing eise.^-If they would add the bulk of 
a chesnut of solid Fat to a common-sized sauoe-boaiful of Gravy, It 
will give it more sapidity than twenty hours stewing lean meat would, 
unless a larger quantity was used than is warranted by the rules of fru* 
gality." See (Nos. 205 and 229). 

*' The experiments of Dr. Stark on the nourishing powers of differ- 
ent substances, go very far to prove that three ounces of the Fat of

mings* of the Broth pot, when fresh and sweet, will baste 
every thing as well as Butter, except game and poultry, and 
should supply the place of Butter for common fries, &c. for 
which they are equal to lard, especially if you repeat the cla- 
rifyine twice over. 

N. B« If you keep it in a cool place, you may preverve it 
a fortnight in summer, and longer in winter. When you 
have done Frying, let the dripping stand a few minutes to 
settle, and then pour it througti a sieve into a clean Basin or 
stone Pan : and it will do a second and a third time as well 
as it did the first,— only the Fat you have fried Fish in mask 
not be used for any other purpose. 

To clarify Suet to fry with. — (No, 84^) 

Cut Beef or Mutton suet into thin slices, pick oat all the 
veins and skins, &c. put it into a thick and well tinned sauce- 
pah, and set it over a very slow kove^ or in an ov^, till it is 
melted; you must not hurry it, — ^if not done, very slowly it 
will acquire a burnt taste, which you cannot get rid of ;rr 
then strain it through a hair sieve into a clean brown pan. 
When quite cold, tie a paper over it and keep it for usCi^ 
Hog's lard is prepared in the same way. 

Obs, — The waste occasioned by the present absurd fashion 

' of over-feeding Cattle till the Fat is nearly equal to tlie lean, 

.may, by good management, be in some measure prevented, 

•^-by cutting off the superfluous part, and preparing it as 

above, or by making it into Puddincp, see (Nos. 551 and

ment from tbe leaner parts of it, it soon becomes offensive to the Taste, 
wbereas the Fat is both more nutritive, and continues to be agreeable

SfcaiU.— (No, 85.) 

Cut the steaks rather thinner than for broiting. Put some 
Butter ox (No. 83) into an iron frying-pan, and when it is 
hot, lay in the steaks, and keep turning them till they are 
done enough. For Sauce, see (No. 356), and for the ac- 
C3inpaninQents (No. 94). 

Ob*. — Unless the Fire be prepared on purpose, we like 
this way of cooking them ; the gravy is preserved ; and the 
meat is more equally dressed, and more evenly browned : 
which makes it more relishing, and invites the eye to encou- 
rage the Appetite. 

Beefsteaks and Ontoiw.— (No. 86.) See also (No. 501.)

Sausages— (No. 87.^ 

Are best when qmte fr&h made—Put a bit of Butter, or 
Dripping (No. 83), into a clean Frying-pan ; as soon as it is 
melted (before it gets hot) put in the Sausages, and shake 
the pan for a minute, and keep turning them, (be careful not 
to break or prick them in so doing), fry them over a very 
slow fire, till they are nicely browned on all sides, — ^when 
they are done, lay them on a hair sieve, placed before the 
fire for a couple of minutes to drain the fat from them. The 

secret of frying Sausages, is, to let them get hot very gradu^ 
ally, they then will not burst, if they are not stale. 

The common practice to prevent them bursting, is to prick 

them with a fork,, but this lets the gravy out. 

You may froth them by rubbing them with cold fresh 

butter, and lightly dredge them with flour, and put them in 

a cheese-toaster or Dutch-oven for a minute. 

Some over-economical Cooks, insist that no butter or lard, 

&c. is required; their own fat being sufficient to fry them; 

^we hav^ tried it^-^the Sausages were partially scorched, 

and had that pye-bald appearance, that all fried things have 

when sufficient fat is not allowed

turn them and do the otner ; if the fire is very fierce, they 
must chang^ sides oftener. The time they will take, depencb 
on the thickness of the Cutlet and the heat of the fire ; half 
an inch thick will take about fifteen minutes. Make some 
Gravy, by putting the trimmings into a stewpan with a little 
soft water, an onion, a roll of lemon peel, ablade of mace, 
^ sprig of thyme and parsley, and abay leaf ; stew over a slow 
fire an hour, then stoin it ; put an ounce of butter into a stew-

Take care to have a very clear brisk fire, throw a little 
salt on it, make the Gridiron hot, and set it slanting, to 
prevent the fat from dropping into the fire, and making a 
smoke. It requires more practice and care than is generally 
supposed to do Steaks to a nicety ; and for want of these 
little attentions, this very common dish, which every body is 
supposed capable of dressing, seldom comes to table in 
perfection.

VEGETABLES. 

Sixteen Ways op dressing Potatoes.* 

(No. 102.) 

The Vegetable Kingdom affords no Food more wholesome, 
more easily procured, easily prepared, or less expensive thaD 
the Potatoe : yet although this most useful v^etable is 
dressed almost every day, in almost every family, — for One 
plate of Potatoes that comes to table as it should. Ten are 
spoiled. 

Be careful in your choice of Potatoes ; no v^etable varies 
80 much in colour, size, shape, consistence, and flavour. 

The reddish coloured are better than the white, but the 
yellowish looking ones are the best. Choose those of a 
moderate size, free from blemishes, and fresh, and buy them 
in the mould; they must not be wetted till they are cleaned to 
be cooked. Protect them from the Air and Frost — ^by laying 
them in heaps in a cellar, covering them with mats, or 
burying them in sand or in earth. The action of Frod 
is most destructive — if it be considerable, the life of the 
vegetable is destroyed, and the Polatoe speedily rots. 

Wash them, but do not pare or cut them, unless they are 

very large, — fill a saucepan half full of Potatoes of equal 

dze,f (or make them so by dividing the larger ones), put 
*■' ■ *»i' ■■■.■■■■ I, i> f 

* *< Next to Bread, there is no vegetable article, the preparatioD of 
which, as food, deser?e8 to be more attended to, than the Potatoe.''— 
Sir John Sinclair's Code of Health, vol. i. p. 354. 

^' By the AnalgsU of Potatoe, it appears that 16 ounces oontaiiM^ 
ll|^ ounces of water— and the 4} ounces of solid parts remaining 
afforded scarce a drachm of earth.**— Parmentibb** Ohs, on Nutritin 
Fe^etableSfSvo. 1783, p. 112.

to them as much cold water as will cover them ahout an 
inch : they are sooner hoiled, and more savoury than when 
drowned in water — most boiled things are spoiled by 
having too little water, but Potatoes are often spoiled by too 
inuch : they must merely be covered, and a little allowed 
for waste in boiling, so that they may be just covered at the 
finish. 

Set them on a moderate fire till they boil, then take them 
off, and set them by the side of the fire to simmer slowly 
till they are soft enough to admit a fork — (place no de- 
pendence on the usual test of their skin cracking, which, if 
they are boiled fast, will happen to some Potatoes when they 
are not half done, and the inside is quite hard,] — then pour 
the water ofi^, (if you let the Potatoes remain in the water a 
moment after they are done enough, they will become waxy 
and watery,) uncover the saucepan, and set it at such a distance 
firom the fire as will secure it from burning ; their super- 
fluous moisture will evaporate, and the Potatoes will be per- 
fectly dry and mealy. 

You may afterwards place a napkin, folded up to the size 
of the saucepan's diameter, over the Potatoes, to keep them 
hot and mesuy till wanted. 

Obs. — This method of managing Potatoes is in every 
respect equal to steaming them ; and they are dressed in half 
the time. 

There is such an infinite variety of sorts and sizes of 
Potatoes, that it is impossible to say how long they will 
take doing ; the best way is to try them with a fork. Mode- 
rate sized Potatoes will generally be enough in fifteen or 
twenty minutes. See Obs, to (No. 1 06.) 

Ck>ld Potatoes Frteci— (No. 1 02.» ) 

Put a bit of clean Dripping into a frying-pan ; when it is 
melted, slice in your Potatoes with a little pepper and salt, 
pxitthem on the fire, keep stirring them; when they are 
.quite hot, they are ready.

Potatoes fried in Slioes or Shavings. — (No. 104.) 

Peel large Potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch 
thick, or cut them in shavings round and round, as you 
would peel a lemon ; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry 
them in lard or dripping. Take care that your fat and fry- 
ing-pan are quite clean ; put it on a quick fire, watch it, and 
as soon as the lard boils, and is still, put in the slices of po« 
tatoe, and keep moving them till they are crisp; take them 
up and lay them to drain on a sieve ; send them up with a 
very little salt sprinkled over them. 

Potatoes fried foholc^^i^o. 105.) 

When nearly boiled enough, as directed in (No. 102), put 
them into a stewpan with a bit of butter, or some nice dean 
beef drippings ; shake them about often (for fear of burn- 
ing them), till they are brown and crisp ; drain them from 
the fat. 

Obs, — It will be an elegant improvement to the three last 
receipts, previous to frying or broiling the Potatoes, to flour 
them and dip them in tne yolk of an egg, and then roll them 
in fine sifted bread crumbs ; they will then deserve^to be 
called POTATOES full dressed.

a coarse cloth or a flannel, or scrubbing-brush ; and proceed 
as in (No. 192). 

N. B. New Potatoes are poor, watery, and. insipid, till 
they are full two inches in diameter — ^they aie not worth the 
trouble of boiling before Midsummer Day. 

Obs. — Some Cooks prepare Sauces to pour over Potatoes, 
made with butter, salt, ana pepper, or jnravy, or melted but* 
ter and catsup, or stew the Potatoes in ale, or water seasoned 
with pepper and salt ; or bake them with herrings, or sprats, 
mixed with layers of potatoes, seasoned with pepper, salt, 
sweet herbs, vmegar, and water; or cut mutton or beef into 
slices, and lay them in a stew pan, and on them potatoes and 
spices, then another layer of the meat alternately, pouring 
in a little water, covering it up very close, and stewing slowly. 

Potatoe Muciiage (a good substitute for Arrow Root), 
(No. 448). 

Jerusalem Ariichohes — (No. 117.) 

Are boiled and dressed in the various ways we have just 
before directed for potatoes. 

N. B. They should be covered with thick melted butter, or 
a bice White or Brown Sauce. 

Cabbage.— i;^o. 118.) 

Pick Cabbages very clean, and wash them thoroughly, 
then look them over carefully again ; quarter them if they are 
very large. Put them into a saucepan with plenty of boiling 
water; if any scum rises, take it off*, put a large spoonful of 
salt into the saucepan, and boil them till ihe stalks feel ten- 
der. A Young Cabbage will take about twenty minutes, or 
half an hour — when FuU Gi^own, near an hour: see that they 
are well covered with wafer all the time, and that no smoke 
or dirt arises frbrn stirring the fire. With careful manage-

ment, they will look as beautiful when dressed^ as they did , 
when growing. 

Obs, — Some Cooks Eay, that it will much ameliorate the 
flavour of strong old Cabhcufes to boil them in two waters; 
t. e. when they are half done, to take them out, and put them 
directly into another saucepan of boilins water, instead of ' 
continuing them in the water into which they were first put 

Boiled Cabbage f lied.— {l!io. 119.) 
See Receipt for Bubble and Squeak, 

Saroy#— (No. 120.) 

Are boiled in the same inanner ; quarter them when you 
send them to table. 

Sprouts and Young Cfreens. — (No. 121.) 

The Receipt we have written for Cabbages will answer 
as well for Sprouts, only they will be boiled enough in fif- 
teen or twenty minutes. 

Spmage.—(^o. 122.) 

Spinage should be picked a leaf at a time, and washed in 
three or four waters ; when perfectly clean, lay it on a sieve, 
or cullender, to drain the water from it. 

Put a saucepan on the fire, three parts filled with water, 
and large enough for the Spinage to float in it ; put a small 
handful of salt in it, let it boil, skim it, and then put in the 
Spinage, make it boil as quick as possible, till quite tender, 
pressing the Spinage down frequently, that it may be done 
equally ; it will be enough in about ten minutes, if boiled in 
plenty of water ; if the Spinage is a little old, give it a few 
minutes longer. When done, strain it on the back of a sieve, 
squeeze it dry with a plate, or between two trenchers, chop 
it fine, and put it into a stewpan with a bit of butter and a 
little salt ; a little cream is a great improvement, or instead 
of either, some rich Gravy. Spread it in a dish, and score 
it into squares of proper size to help at table. 

05«.-— Grated nutmeg, or mace, and a little lemon juice, 
is a favourite addition with some cooks, and is added when 



VEGETABLES. 191 

you Stir it up in the stewpan with the butter garnished. 
Spihage is frequently served with Poached Eggs with fried 
bread. 

•Asparagus. — (No. 123.) 

Set a stewpan with plenty of water in it on the fire ; 
sprinkle a handful of salt in it, let it boil, and skim it ; then 
put in your Asparagus, prepared thus : — Scrape all the stalks 
till they are perfectly clean, throw them into a pan of cold 
water as you scrape them ; when they are aU done, tie them 
up in little bundles, of about a quarter hundred each, with 
Imiss, if you can get it, or tape ; string cuts them to pieces : 
cut off the stalks at the bottom, that they may be all of a 
length,, leaving only just enough to serve as a handle for the 
ereen part ; when they are tender at the stalk, which will 
be in from twenty to thirty minutes, they are done enough. 
Great care must l>e taken to watch the exaxi time of their 6e- 
candng tender; take them up just at that instant, and they 
will have their true flavour and colour : — a minute or two 
more boiling destroys both. 

While the Asparagus is boiling, toast a round of a quar- 
tern loaf, about half an inch thick, brown it delicately on 
both sides, dip it lightly in the liquor the Asparagus was. 
boiled in, and lay it in the middle of a dish : melt some but- 
ter (No. 256), then lay in the Asparagus upon the Toasts 
which must project beyond the Asparagus, that the company 
inay see there is a Toast. 

Pour no butter over them, but send some up in a boat, or 
White Sauce {No. 364,) (No. 2.) 

Sea Ifa/c— (No. 124.) 

Is tied up in bundles, and dressed in the same way as As- 
paragus. 

Cauliflower.— ij^o. 125.) 

Choose those that are close and white, and of the middle 
size, trim off the outside leaves, cut the stalk off flat at the 
bottom, let them lie in salt and water an hour before you 
boil them. 

Put them into boiling water with a handful of salt in it.

skim it well, and let it boil slowly till done, which a small 
one will be in fifteen, a large one in about twenty minutes^ 
take it up the moment it is enoughy a minute or two longer 
boiling will spoil it. 

N. B. Cola Cauliflowers and French Beans^ Carrots and 
Turnips^ boiled so as to eat rather crisp, are sometimes dressed 
as a Salad (No. 372 or 453.) 

BroooK.— (No. J 26.) 

Set a pan of clean cold water on the table, and a sauce- 
pan on the fire with plenty of water, and a handful of salt 
In it. 

Brocoli is prepared by stripping off all the side shoots, 
leaving the top ; peel off the skin of the stalk with ai knife, 
cut it close off at the bottom, and put it into the pan of cold 
Water. 

When the water in the stewpan boils, and the Brocoli is 
ready, put it in, let it boil briskly till the stalks feel tender, 
from ten to twenty minutes ; — ^take it up with a slice, that 
you may not break it ; let it drain, and serve up. 

If some of the heads of Brocoli are much higgler than tha 
others, put them on to boil first, so that they may get all done 
together. 

Obs. — It makes a nice supper dish served upon a toast, 
like Asparagus. It is a very delicate vegetable, and you 
must take it up he moment it is done, and send it to table 
hot. 

Red Beet Roots-^i^o. 127.) 

Are not so much used as they deserve ; they are dressed 
in the same way as Parsnips, only neither scraped nor cut 
tilt after they are boiled : they will take from an hour and a half 
to three hours in boiling, according to their size. — to be sent 
to table with Salt Fish, Boiled Beef, &c. When young, 
lar^e, and juicy, it is a very good variety, — ^an excellent gar- 
nish,— and easily converted into a very cheap and pleasant 
pickle. 

Parsnip*— (No. 128.) 
Are to be cooked just in the same manner as Carrots; they 



YBGBTABLES. 193. 

require more or less time according to their size, therefore 
match them in size, and you must try them, hy thrusting a 
fork into them as they are in the water ; when that goes, 
eaaly trough, they are done enough; boil them from an. 
hour, or two hours, according to their size and freshness. 

06i. — Parsnips are sometimes sent up mashed in the same 
way as Turnips, and some Cooksi quarter them before they 
boil them. 

GiTTofjr.— (No. 129.) 

liet them be well washed and brushed, not scraped : an 
hour is enough for young spring carrots ; grown carrots must 
be cut in half, and will take fviMu an hour and a half to two 
hoars and a half. When done, rub off the peels with a clean . 
coarse clotb, and slice them in two or four, according to 
their size. The best way to try if they are done enough, is 
to pierce them with a fork. . ^ 

Obs. — ^Many people are fond of cold Carrot with cold 
Beef, ask if you shall cook enough for some to be left to send 
up with the cold meat. 

Tiimtp*.— (No. 130.) 

Peel off half an inch of the stringy outside ; full-grown tur- 
nips will take about an hour and a half gentle boiling ; if 
ypu ^ce them, which most people do, they will be done 
sooner; try them with a fork, — ^when tender, take them 
up, and ky them on a sieve till the water is thoroughly 
drained from them : send them up whole ; do not slice them. 

N.B. To very young Turnips leave about two inches of the 
Green Top. See (No. 132.) 

To Mask r«mp«.— (No. 131.) 

When they are boiled quite tender, squeeze (kern tis dry an 
|>0fA6/e' between two trenchers, put them into a saucepan^ 
mash them with a wooden spoon, and rub them through a 
cullender, add a little bit of butter, keep stirring them till the 
butter is melted and well mixed with them, and they are 
ready for table. 

Turnip Tojx,— (No. 132.) 
Are the shoots which grow out (in the spring) of the old 

K 



194 V^]^tABI/SSi 

ttirnip roots. Put them into cold water an hour before they 
are dressed ; the more water they are boiled in, the better 
they will look; if boiled in a «mall quantity of water, they 
will taste bitter ; when the water boils, put in a small hand- 
ful of salt^ and then your vegetables ; if fresh and young, 
they will be done in about twenty minutes; drain them on 
the back of a sieve. 

French B^n^.— (No. 133.) 

Cut off the stalk epd first, and then turn to the point and 
strip off the strings : — If not quite fresK have a bowl of 
Sipring water, with a little $alt dissolved in it, standing bdbre 
I you, and a^ the beans are cleaned and stringed, throw them 
in: — ^when all arc done, put them on the fire, in boiling 
water, with some salt in it; when they have boiled fifteen 
or twenty minutes, take one out and taste it; as soon as they 
are tender, take them up, throw them into a cullender or sieve 
to drain. 

To send up the beans whole is much the best method when 
they are thus young, and their delicate flavour and colour are 
much better preserved. When a little more grown, they 
must be cut across in two, after stringing ; and for common 
tables they arft fiplit, and divided across ; cut them all ibe 
same length ^but those, who are nice, never haveth«mitC 
such a growth as to require splitting. 

When they are very large, they look pretty oat into 
Lozenges. 

0^*.— See N.BL to (No. J 25.) 

Grccw Fea*c.*— (No. J 34.) 

Young Green Pease, well dressed, are one of the most deli- 
cious delicacies of the vegetable kingdom. They must be 
young ; it is equally indispensable that they be fresh gathered^ 



* These and all other fraits^and Tegetable$, (fee. by Mr. Appbrt^ 
plan, it is said, may be preserved for twelvemonths.— See Appbrt'^ 
Book, 12mo. 1812. We. have, eaten of several specimens of preserved 
Pease — which looked pretty enough, — but flavour tl^ey had none at 
all. 



VEGETABLES. 195 

and cooked as $oon as they are shelled, for they soon lose both 
their colour and sweetness. 

If you wish to feast upon Pease in perfection, you 
most have them gathered the same day they are dressed, 
and put on to boil within half an hour after they are shelled. 
Pass them through a riddle^ u e. a coarse sieve, which is 
made for the purpose of separating them. This precaution 
is necessary, for large and small pease cannot be boiled to- 
gether, as the former will take more time than the latter. 

For a peck of pease, set on a saucepan with a gallon of 
water in it ; when it boils, put in your pease with a table- 
spooi^ of salt, — skim it well, keep them boiling quick 
from twenty to thirty minutes, accoraing to their aee and 
size: the best way to judge of their being done enough, and 
indeed the only way to make sure of co(^ing them to, and 
not beyond, tne point of perfection, or, as Pea-eaters say, of 
'* boUing them to a bubble^** is to take ihem out with a spoon 
and taste them. 

When they are enough, drain them on a hair sieve, tf 
you like them buttered, put them into a pie-dish, divide sotne 
butter into small bits, and lay them on the pease : put 
another dish over them, and turn them over and over ; tnis; 
will melt the butter through them ; but as all people do not 
like buttered pease, you had better send thei%io table plain, 
as they come out of the saucepan, with melted butter (No. 
256,) in a sauce tureen. It is usual to boil some Mint with 
the Pease ; but if you wish to garnish the Pease with Mint, 
boil a few sprigs in a saucepan by themselves. See Sage 
and Onion Sauce (No. 300,) and Pea Powder (No. 458.) 
To boil Bacon (No. 1 3,) Slices of Ham and Bacon (No. 
526,) and Relishing Rashers of Bacmi (No. 527.) 

N.B. A Peck of young Pease will not yield more than 
.enotgh for a couple of hearty Pea-eaters, — ^when the pods 
are full, it may serve for three. 

Mem. — ^Never think of purchasing Pease ready^shelled, for 
the cogent reasons assigned in the first part of this receipt. 

. Cucumber iSteioed.— (No. 135.) 

Peel and cut cucumbers in quarters, take out the seeds,

195 VEGETABLES. 

and lay them on a cloth to drain off the water : when they 
are dry, flour and fry them in fresh butter ; let the butter 
be quite hot before you put in the cucumbers ; fry them till 
they are brown, then take them out with an. egg slice, and 
lay them on a sieve to drain the fat from them : (some Cooks 
fry sliced Onions, or some small Button Onions, with them, till 
they are a delicate light brown colour, drain them from the 
fat, and then put them into a stewpan, with as mucb Gravy 
as will cover them ;) stew slowly till tLey are tender ; take 
out the cucumbers with a slice, thicken the Gravy with flour 
and butter, give it a boil up, season it with pepper and salt, 
and put in the Cucumbers ; as soon as they are warm, they 
are ready. 

The above, rubbed through a Tammis or fine sieve, will 
be entitled to be called "Cucumber Sauce." See (No. 
399,) Cucumber Vinegar. This is a very favourite sauce 
with lamb or mutton cutlets, stewed rump steaks, &c. &c. ; 
when made for the latter, a third part of sliced onion is some- 
times fried with the cucumber. 

^r^c^oAc*.— (No. 136.) 

Soak them in cold water, wash them well, then put them 
into plenty of boiling water, with a handful of salt, and let 
them boil gently till they are tender, which will take an hour 
and a half, or two hours ; the surest way to know^When they 
are done enough, is to draw out a leaf; trim them and drain 
them on a sieve ; and send up melted butter with them, which 
some put into small cups, so that each guest may have one. 

Stewed Oniovs. — (No. 137.) 

The large Portugal Onions are the best ; take off the top- 
coats of half at dozen of these, (taking care not to cut off the 
tops or tails too near, or the onions will go to pieces;) and 
put them into a stewpan broad enough to hold them without 
laying them atop of one another, and just cover them with 
good broth. 

Put them over a slow fire, and let them simmer about two 
hours ; when you dish them, turn them upside down^ and 
pour the sauce over.

Those who desire to see thts^nbject elaborately illustrated, 
we refer to " Evylyn's Acetaria^^^ a discourse of Sallets, a 
12mo. of 240 pages. London, 1699. 

Mr. £. gives us ^* an account of seve7Uy'4tffo herbs proper 
and fit to make Sallet with/* — and a table of Thirtyjivey 
telling their seasons and proportions. *< In the composure of 
a Sallet, every plant should come in to bear its part, like the 
Notes in Music : thus the comical Master Cook introduced 
by Damoxenus^ when asked, * what Harmony there was in 
Meats?* — *the very same,' says he, *as the 3d, 5th, and 8th 
have to one another in music — the main skill lies in this, 
not to mingle f^sapores minimi consentientes* J^-^.Tzaltes not 
well joined — inelegant,' as our Paradisian Bard directs Eve 
when dressing a sallet for her Angelical Guest. "^ "*-Milton*8 
Paradise Lost. 

He gives the following Receipt for the Oxoleon: 

" Take of clear and perfectly good OyUOlive three part»— 
of sharpest Vinegar^ {sweetest of all CondimentSy for it incites 
appetite, and causes Hunger, which is the best sauce,) Limon, 
or juice of Orange^ one part — and therein let steep some slices 
of Horseradish^ with a little Salt : some, in a separate Vine- 
gar, gently bruise a pod of Ginny Pepper, and strain it to the 
other — then add as much Mustard as will lie upon a half- 
<:rown piece. Beat and mingle these well together with the 
yolk of two new-laid Eggs boiled hard, and pour it oyer your 
^let, stirring it well together. The ^uper-curious insist that 
the knife with which Sallet herb is cut must be of Silveri-^ 
«ome who are husbands of their Oyl, pour at first the Oyl alone, 
as more apt to communicate and diffuse its slipperiness, 
than when it is mingled and beaten with the Acids, which 
they pour on last of all ; and it is incredible how small a quan- 
tity of Oyl thus applied is sufficient to imbue a very plentiful 
aasembly of Sallet Herbs."

aboimds with rich gelatinous nuitriment. 

Being drawn, and washed clean, if it be quite fresh, by

<< ToRBOTS. The finest brought to the London market, are eaof^ 
offtbe Dutch coast, or German ocean, and are brought in weU-bools 
jtUve. The oommencement of th^ season is generally about Maitch and 
April, and continues all the summer. Turbots, like other fish, do not 
spawn all at the same time; therefore there is always good and bad 
nearly all the year round. For this year or two past, there has been an 
■ immense quantity brought to London, from all parts, and of all qua- 
lities: a great many from a new fishery oflT Hartlepool, which area 
vei^ haiidsome looking turbot, but by no means equal to what are 
caaght off the Dutch coast. Many excellent Turbots are caught off 
Dover and Dungeness ; and a large quantity brought from Scotland, 
packed in ice, which are of a very inferior quality, and are generally to 
be bought for about one-fourth the price of good turbots.

hwdful of salt into a nsh kettle with cokl irater, lay your 
&b on a fish strainer, put it in, and when it is coming to a 
boil, skim it well ; then set the kettle on the side of the fire, 
to boil as gently as possible for about fifteen or twenty 
Qiinutes; (if it .boils ftst, the fish will break to pieces) ; 
supposing it a middhng sized Turbot, and to weigh eight or 
oioe pounds. 

Rub a little of the inside Red Coral spawn of the Lobster 
through a hair sieve, without butter ; and when the Turbot 
is dished, sprinkle the spawn over it Gramish the dudi 
vith sprigs of curled Parsley, sliced Lemon, and finely 
scraped Horseradish. 

, If you like to send it to table in Full Dress, surround it 
with nicely Fried SmeUa (No. 173), — Gudgeons are often 
^ised for this purpose, and may be bought very cheap when 
Smelts are very dear; lay the largest opposite the broadest 
part of the Turbot, so that they may form i -weU-propor- 
^ped fringe for it,— or Oysters (No. 183*), or cut a Sole in 
s^ps,. crosswaya^ about the size of a Smelt; fry them ^as 
Erected in (No. 145,) and lay them round. Send up Lob- 
^teF sance (No. 284), two boatt of it, if it is for a lai^ 
pwty.

tbe Fillets that are left as soon as the Turbot returns from' 
7able, and they will make a side dish* for your next diimer, 
warmed in (No. 364), (No. 2.)

of this Fish must remember to ask his friends if they are 
^if^rFawsiers. It will save a troublesome Job to the Carver, 
if the Cook, when the Fish is boiled, cuts the spine-*bone 
^oss the middle.

it on ihe side of the fire, take off the scum as it rises, and let 
it boil gently, about five minutes (according to its si2e)^ wifl

fish-drainer garnished with slices of Lemon and 8{)rigs ci 
cui'led Parsley, or nicely fried Smelts (No. 173), or Orsters 
(No. 183.) 

Obs, — Slions of Lemon are a universally acceptable gar* 
nish, with either fried or broiled fish:— -a few Sprigs of crisp 
Parsley may be added, if you wish to make it look very 
smart; and Parsley, or Fennel and Butter, are excellent 
sauces, 9ee (No. 26i), and (Now 265), or Chervil sauce

S0LES9 OR OTHER Fish, to Fry. — (No. 145.} 

Soles are generally to be procured good from some part of 
the coast, as some are going out of season, and some coming 
in, both at the same time ; a great many are brouc;^ht in well- 
boats, alive, that are caught off Dover, and Folkstone, and 
some are brought from the same places by land, carriages 
The finest Soles are caught off Plymouth, near theEddistone, 
and all the way up the Channel, and to Torbay ; and fr&> 
quently weigh eight or ten pounds per pair: they are generally 
brought by water to Portsmouth, and thence by land ; but 
the greatest quantity are caught off Yarmouth and the Knole, 
and off the Forelands. 

Be sure they are quite fresh^ or the cleverest Cook cannot 
make them either look, or eat well. 

An Hour before you intend to dress theniy wash them 
thoroughly, and wrap them in .a clean cloth, to make them 
perfectly dry,-H>r the Bread crumbs will not stick to them.

Sieve, or use Biscuit Powder. 

Beat the yolk and white of an Egg well together^ on a 
plate, with a fork ;-— flour your fish to absorb any moisture 
that may remain, and wipe it off with a clean cloth ^— dip 
them in the egg on both sides all over, or, what is better, egg 
them with a paste brush; put the E^ on in an even' degree 
over the whole Fish, or the bread ctumbs will not stick to it 
even — and the uneven part will bum to the pan. — Strew the 
Bread Crumbs all over the Fish, so that they cover every 
part,— take up the Fish by the head, and shake off the loose 
trumbs. The Fish is now ready for the Fryingpan. 

Put a Quart or more of fresh sweet Olive Oil, or Clarified 
Butter (No. 259), Dripping (No. 83), Lard,* or Clarified 
Drippings (No. 83) ; be sure they are quite sweet and per- 
fectly clean; f^the Fat ought to cover the Fish: J what we 
here order, is for Soles about ten inches long, — ^if larger, cut 
thim into pieces the proper size to help at table; this will 
save much time and trouble to the Carver,— when you send 
them to table, lay them in the same form they were before 
they were cut, and you may strew a little curled Parsley 
over them : they are much easier managed in the Fryingpan, 
and require less. Fat; fry the Thick part a few minutes be- 
fore" you put in the TTiin — you can by this means only fry 
the Uiick part enough, without frying the fhin too much. 
Very Large Soles should be boiled (No. 144), or fried in 
Filiets (No. 147). Soles ciU in pieces, crosswayi, aboiUthe

^d boiled Fish. 

Set the fryingpan over a sharp and clear fire ; watch it, 
^kiiii it with an Egg slice, and when it boils, f u e. when it 
has done bubbling, and the smoke just begins to rise from 
the surface, put in the Fish:— -if the Fat is not extremely hot^ 
it is impossible to fry Fish of a good colour, or to keep them

202 FISH, 

£rm auQd cri^pt (read the 3d Chapter of the Radiments of 
Cookery.) 

TheheStvfzy to. ascertain the Jieat of the Fat, ia to try it 
with a bit of bread as big as a nut ; if it is quite hot enough, 
the bread will brown immediately. Put in the Fish, and it will 
be crisp and brown on the side next the fire, in about four 
or five minutes ; to turn it, stick a two-pronged fork near 
the head, and support the tail with a fish-slice, and fry the 
other side nearly the same length of time. 

Fry One Sole at a time, except the pan is very large, and 
you have plenty of fat. 

When the Fish are fried, lay them on a soft cloth (M 
table cloths are best), near enough the fire to keep them 
warm ; turn them every two or three minutes^ tUl.they are 
quite dry on both sides — ^this, common Cooks commonly 
neglect. It will take. ten or fifteen minutes, * if the Fat you 
fried them in was not hot enough ; when it is, they want 
very little drying. When Soles arefried^ they will keep very 
aood in a dry place for three or four days; warm them^ ^ 
Jmnging them on the hooks in a Dutch oven, letting them heat 
very gradually, by putting it some distance from the fire for 
about twenty minutes, or in good Gravy, as Eels, Wiggv'S 
WAY, (Nos. 164, 299, 337, or 356.) 

Obs. — -There are several general rules in this Receipt 
which apply to all Fried Fish : — we have been very paid* 
Cular and minute in our directions; for, although a Fried 
^le is so frequent and favourite a dish, it is very seldom 
brtM^ht to table in perfection, f 



* If you are in haute, lay the Sole on a clean soft elotb, cover it witk 

U% and gently press it upon the fish to suck up the fat from its surface. 

t The very indifferent manner in which the operation of frying fish 

fs utually performed, we suppose, produced the {oUamngJemd'etprit, 

which api eared in The Morning Chrcnicle:— 

" The King's Bench Reports have cookM up an odd dti^ 
An action for damages, Fry versus Fish. 
But surf , if for damages action could lie. 
It certainly niust have been Fi^h against FryJ^ 
The author of the Cook^s Cookery, 8vo. page 116^ does not leeai t«> 
tlink this fish can be too fresh ; for he commences his disectiMM with,. 
«^ Jff you can, g;et a Cod hot out of the Sea/' ^c*. 



SaU8toStew.—{l^o.Ue.) 

These are half fried, and then done the same as £els» 
Wifgy's waif. See (No. 164.) 

Fillets of Solesy Brown or ]^i(«.— (No. 147.) 

Take off 4he Fillets very nicely, trim them neatly, and 
press them dry between a soft cloth ; Egg, Crumb, and Fry 
them, &e. as directed in (No. 145), or boil them, and serve 
them with (No. 364), (No. 2.) 

N. B. This is one of the best ways of dressing very large 
Soles. See also (No. 164.) 

5Aate— (No. 148.) 

Is very good when in good season, bat no fish so bad 
when it is otherwise: those persons that like it firm and 
dry, should have it crimped ; but those ihil like it tender, 
should have it plain, and eat it not earlitf than the second 
day, and if cold weather, three or four days old it is better: 
it cannot be kept too long, if perfectly sweet Young Skate 
«ts very fine, crimped and fried, see (No. 154.) 

Cod Boilei— (No. 149.) 

Wash and clean the fish, and rub a little salt in the inside 
of it: (if the weather is very cold, a large cod is the better 
for being kept a day) : put plenty of water in your fish 
kettle, so that the fish may be well covered ; put in a large 
handful of salt: and when it is dissolved, put in your fish; 
a very small fish will require from fifteen to twenty minutes, 
after the water boils, — a large one about half an hour ; drain 
it on the fish plate ; dish it with a garnish of the Roe, Liver, 
Chitterlings, &c.; or large native Oysters, fried a light 
brown, see (iNo. 183*), or Smelts (No. 173), Whitiiigs 
(No. 153), the teal* of the Cod cut in slices or bits, the size 



^ The TAiii is 90 moch thinner thaii Xhk thick part of the body, that, if 
Med together, the former will be boiled too much— before the latter

^&y of cooking it is to fiy it in Slices or Fillets; see (No. 151.)

C^ers (No. 182), Oyster Sauce (No, 278). Slices of 
Cod cut about half an inch thick, and fried as Soles, (No. 
145,) are very nice. . 

Mem. — Tfie Sounds, — ^the jelly parts about the Jo^,— 
the Palate, — and the 'longue, are esteemed exquisites by 
piscivorous Epicures — whose longing Eyes will keep a sharp 
look-out for a share of their favourite *^ Bonne Bouche:^* — 
the Carver's reputation depends much on his equitable dis- 
tribution of them. 

. Salt Fish Boi/cd.— (No. 150.) 

Salted Fish requires Soaking^ according to live time it has 
been in Salt; — trust not to those you buy it of, but taste a 
bit of one of the flakes ; that which is hard and dry^ re- 
Quires two nights soaking, changing the water two or three 
times; the intermediate day, lay it on a stone floor; — for 



latter eiKTof January, and February, and part of March, they are mostly 
poor ; but tbe latter end of March, April, and May, tbey are generally 
particularly fine, .having shot their spawn, they come in fine order, lie 
Dogger-Bank Cod are the most esteemed, as they generally cut in 
lai^ fine flakes ; the north country Cod, which are caught off the Ork- 
ney Isles, are generally very stringy, or what is commonly called 
woolly ^ and sell at a very inferior price, but are caught in much greater 
abundance than the Dogger Cod. The Cod are all caught with hook, 
and brought alive in well-boats to the London markets. The Cod 
cured on the Dogger-Bank is remarkably fine, and seldom cured above 
two or three weeks before brought to market; Xhe Barrel Cod is com- 
monly cured on the coast of Scotland and Yorkshire. There is a gieat 
deal of inferior cured salt fish brought f.om Newfoundland and Iceland. 

" The Skull of a Dogger-Bank Cod is one of those concatenations 
of f/f biUf which some epicures are fond of either baked or boiled: it 
is composed of lots of pretty playthings or such finery, but will not do 
for those who want a good Aieal: it may be bought for about Za. — 
either boil it whole, or cut it into pieces— flour and dry them, and then 
egg and crumb, and firy them, or stew it (No. 158.) 

" The TAIL of a Cod cut in fillets, or slices, and fried, mak^s a good 
dish, and generally to be bought at a very reasonable rate ;- jf boiled, it 
is soft and watery. The Skull and Tail of a Cod is a favourite and ei- 
cellent Scotch dish, stewed, and served up with Anchovy or Oyster 
Sauce, with tbe liquor it is boiled in, in a Tureen. 

*' Ling is brought to the London market in the same manner aa Cod, 
but is very inferior to it, either fresh or salt.*' 



FI8H. 205 

BarreUed Cod^ less time will do ; and foi* the best Dogger 
Bonk Split Fish, which has not been more than a fortnight 
or three weeks in salt, still less will be needful* 

Put it into plenty of cold water, and let it simmer very gendy 
till it is enough — if the water boils, the Fish will be tough 
and thready.* For Egg sauce, see (No. 267), and to boil 
Red Beetroot (No. 127), Parsnips (No. 128), Carrots (No. 
129). Garnish Salt Fish with the yolks of Eggs, cut into 
quarters. 

Obs, — Our favourite vegetable accompaniment is a dKsh of 
equal parts of Red Beetroot and Parsnips. 

N. B. Salted Fish differs in QucUity quite as mnd^ <u 
it does in Price, 

Slices of Cod Boifcd— (No. 151.) 

Hcdf an Hour before you dress thenii put them inlo cold 
spring water with some salt in it. 

Lay them at the bottom of a fish-kettle, with as much cold 
spring water as will cover them, and some salt ; set it on 
a quick fire, and when it boih, skim it, and set it on 'one 
side of the fire to boil very gently, for about ten minutes, 
according to its size and thickness. Garnish with scraped 
Horseradish, slices of Lemon, and a slice of the Liver on 
one side, and Chitterling on the other. Oyster Sauce (No. 
278), and Plain Butter. 

Obs. — Slices op Con (especially the Tail, split,) are 
VBRY GOOD, FRIED KAc Soles (No. 145), or stewed ia Gravy 
like Eels (No. 164), or (No. 364, No. 2.) 

Fresh Siwrjcon.— (No. 152.) 

The best mode of dressing this, is to have it cat in thin 

slices like Veal Cutlets, and broiled, and rubbed over with 

-' - - ■ _ - ■ ,^ 

* <* In the sea-port towns of tbe New England States in North Ame* 
lica, it bsi been a cu^om, time immemorial, among^ people of fashion, 
todinet>ne day in the week (Saturday) on Salt Fish, — and a ion|; 
babit of preparintc the same dish has, as might have been OKpeoted, led 
to very considerable improvements in the art of cooking it. I bare 
eftren heard foreigners declare^ thai they never tasted Salt Fish dressed 
in such perfection ; the secret vf Cooking it, is to keep it for several 
bonrs in water that is Just scalding hot, but which is never made actuaUy 
to boil.^^— Count Rumpobd's 10th Essa^^ p. 18. 



E06 visy. 

a bit of Butter and a little Pepper, and served very 
hot, aod eaten with a squeeze of Lemon Juice. Great care, 
however, must be taken to cut off the skin before it is broiled, 
as the oil in the skin, if burnt, in^parts a disgusting flavour 
to the fish. The flesh is very fine, and comes nearer to Vea)^ 
perhaps, than even Turtle. 

Sturgeon is frequently plentiful and reasonable in the 
London shops. We prefer this mode of dressing it to the 
more savoury one of stewine it in rich gravy, like Carp, &c. 
which overpowers the peculiar flavour of the fish. 

Whitings fWc(£.— (No. 153.) 

Skin* them, preserve the Liver, see (No. 228), and fasten 
their Tails to their Mouths; dip them in egg, tnen in bread 
crumbs, and fry them in hot lard, read (No. 145) ; — or 
split them, and fiy thiem like fillets of Soles (No. 147). 

A three quart stewpan, half full of fat, is the best utensil 
to fry Whitings. They will be done enough in about five 
minutes — ^but it will sometimes require a quarter of an hour 
to drain the fat from them and dry them (if the fat you put 
them into was, not hot enough), turning them now and then 
with a Fish Slice. 

Ohs, — When Whitings are scarce, the Fishmongers can 
njlcin'and truss young Codlings^ so that you can hardly tell 
4he difference, except that a Codling wears a Beard, and a 
Whiting does not :^this distinguishing mark is sometimes 
cut off ; however, if you turn up his Jowl, you may see the 
mark where the Beard was, and thus discover. whether He 
be a Real Whiting,— or a Skaved Codling. 

iSSiafc Fried— (No. 154.) 

After you have cleaned the fish, divide it into fillets, dry 
them on a clean cloth; beat the yolk and white of an egs^ 
thoroughly. together, dip the fish in this, and then in fine 
bread crumbs ; fry it in hot lard or drippings till it is of* a 
delicate brown colour; lay it on a hair sieve to drain; gar- 
nish with Crisp Parsley (No. 318) — and some like Caper 

Sauce, with an Anchovy in it.

FI8H. 207 

Plaice or Flounders Fried^ or Bot7«/,— -(No, 155.) 

Ftoupders are perhaps the most difScnlt fish to fry very 
Dicdy. Clean them well, flour them, and wipe them with 
a dry doth to absorb all the water from them ; Hour or egg 
and bread crumb them, &c. as directed in (No. 145). 

To Boil Flounders. 

Wash and clean them well, cut the black sid^ of them the 
wme as you do Turbot, then put them into a fish-kettle, with 
plenty of cold water and a handful of salt; when they come 
to a boil, scum them clean, and let them stand by the side of 
the fire for five minutes, and ihey are ready. 

06^.— Eateti with plain melted butter and a little salt, you 
have the sweet delicate flavour of the Flounder^— which is 
overpowered by any sauce. 

Water Souchij*—(^o. 156.) 

Is made with Flounders, Whitings, Gudgeons, or Eels. 
These must be quite /resh^ and very nicely cleaned; fof 
what they are boiled in, is the sauce for them. 

Wash, gut, and trim your Fish, cut them into handsome 
pieces, and put them into a stewpan with just as much water 
as will cover them, with some parsley, or parsley roots 
sliced, an onion minced fine, and a little pepper and salt: (to 
this some Cooks add some scraped Horseradish and a Bay 
leaf;) skim it carefully when it boils ; when your fish is 
clone enough (which it will be m a few minutes), send it up 
i^ a deep dish, lined with bread sippets, and some slices of 
hfead and butter on a plate. 

06*. — Some Cooks thicken the liquor the Fish has been 
stewing in with flour and butter, and flavour it with white 
wine, Lemon juice. Essence of Anchovy, and Catsup— and 
Wl down two or three Flounders, &c. to make a fish broth, 
to boil the other fish in, observing, that the Broth cannot be 
good, unless the Fish are boiled too much.

litde trouble or expense. For richer stewed Fish, see (No. Id4 .) 



208 FISH. 

Haddock BoiW.— (No. 157.) 

Wash it well, and put it on to boil, as directed in (Np.l49); 
a Haddock of Uiree pounds will take about ten, minutes after 
the kettle boils. 

Haddocks salted a day or two, are eaten with egg sauce, 
or cut in fillets, and fried. Or, if small, very well broiled, or 
baked, with a pudding in their belly, and some good gravy. 

Obs, — A Piscivorous Epicure protests that *^ Haddock h 
the poorest fish that swims, and has neither the delicacy of 
the Whiting, nor the juiciness of the Cod." 

Findkom Haddoch.^^i^o. 157.*) 

Let the Fish be well cleaned and laid in Salt for two hours, 
let tlie water drain from them, and then wet them with the 
Pyroligneous ocu/,-*— they may be split or not, — they are 
then to be hung in a dry situation for a day or two^ or a 
week or two, if you please; when broiled, they have all the 
flavour of the Findhorn Haddock, and will keep sweet for a 
long time. 

The Pyroligneous acid, applied in the same way to Beef or 
Mutton, gives the fine smoke flavour, and may be kept for a 
considerable length of time. 

Scotch way of dressing Haddocks, — A. Haddock is quite 
like a different fish in London and in Edinburgh, which 
arises chiefly from the manner in which they are treated: 
a Haddock should never appear at table with its head and 
skin on. For boiling, they are all the better for lying a 
iHght in salt; of course they do not take so long to boil witL- 
out the skin, and require to be well skimmed to preserve the 
colour.— After lying in salt for a night, if you hang them up 
for a day or two, they are very good broiled and served with 
cold butter. For frying^ they should be split and boned 
very carefully, and divided into convenient pieces, if too 
large to halve merely ; egg and crumb them, and fry in a 
good deal of lard ; they resemble soles when dressed in this 
mainner. There is another very delicate mode of dressing 
them ; you split the fish, rub it well with butter, and do it 
before the fire in the Dutch-oven.

To stew Cod's Skully SoIeSj Carp, Trottt^ Perchj Ed, 
or Flounder.— (J!lo. 15%.)— See also (No. 164.) 

When the Fi^ ha« heen properly washed, lay it in a stew-* 
pan, with half a pint of Claret or Port wine, and a quart of 
c;ood gravy (No. 329 ;) — a large onion, a dozen berries of 
black pepper, the same of allspice, and a few cloves, or a bit 
of mace ; cover the fish-kettle close, and let it stew gently 
for ten or twenty minutes, according to the thickness of the 
fish : take the fish up, lay it on a hot dish, cover it up, and 
thicken the liquor it was stewed in with a little flour, and sea* 
son it with Pepper, Salt, Essence of Anchovy, Mushroom 
Catsup, and a little Chili Vinegar ; when it has boiled ten 
minutesy strain it through a tammis, and pour it over the fish : 
if there is more sauce than the dish will hold, send the rest 
up in a boat 

. The River TrotU comes into season in April, and continues 
till July ; it is a delicious fish ; those caught near Uxbridge 
come to town quite alive. 
The Eels and PercA, from the same water, are very fine. 
Ofc#.<.— These fish are very nice plain boiled, with (No. 
261,) or (No. 264,) for sauce; some Cooks dredge them with 
flour, and fry them a light brown before they put them on to 
stew, — and stufi* them with (No. 374,) or some of the stuff- 
ings following. 

To Dress them Maigre. 

Pot the Fish into a stewpan, with a large Onion^ Ibur 
Cloves, fifteen berries of Allspice, and the same black pep- 
per-*^ust cover them with boiling water, set it where 
they will simmer gently for ten or twenty minutes, accord- 
ing to the size of the Fish ; strain off the Uquor in another 
stewpan, leaving the Fish to keep warm till the Sauce is 
ready. 

Rub together on a plate as much flour and butter as will 
make the Sauce as thick as a double Cream. Each PUU oj 
Sauce season with a glass of Wine, half as much Mushroom 
Catsup, a tea-spooniful of Essence of Anchovy, and a few 
grains of Cayenne ; let it boil a few minutes, put the Fish on

a deep dish, strain the Gravy over it ; garnish it with Sippets 
of Bread toasted or fried (No. 319.) 

N.B. The Editor has paid particular attention to the above 
Receipt — and also to {No. 224,) which Catholics^ and thom 
whose Religums tenets do not allow them to eat Meat on Maim 
Dayst will find a very satisfectory substitute for the Meat 
Gravy Soup (No. 200.) 

, Fpr Saucb for Maigre Dishes, see (Nos. 225^ 305, and 
364, No. 2.) 

Obs. — Mushroom Catsup (No. 439,) and Onions (No. 402^) 
supply the place of Meat better than any thing ; if you have 
pot these, Wine — Spice (No. 457,) — Curry Powder (No. 
455,) Aromatic Roots and Herbs,— Anchovy and Soy,— or 
Oyster Catsup (No. 441,) variously combined, and thickened 
with flour and butter, are convenient substitutes* 

Maigre Fish Pies. 

Salt Fish Pie, — The thickest part must be chosen, and put 
in cold water to soak the night before wanted ; then boil it 
well, take it up, take away the bones and skin, and if it is 
good fish it will be in fine layers ; set. it on a fishrdrainer to 
get cold: in the mean time boil four' e§^s h^ird,. peel and 
slice them very thin, the same quantity of onion sliced thin, 
line the boUom of a Pie dish with Fish forcemeat, (Na ' 
383,) or a layer of potatoes sliced thin, — ^then a layer of 
onions, then of fish, and of eggs, and so on till the aish is 
full ; season each layer with a little pepper, then mix a tea- ' 
spoonful of made mustard, the same of Essence of Anchovy, 
a little Mushroom Catsup in a gill of water, put it inthe dim, 
then put on the top an ounce of fresh butter broke in bits, 
cover it with puff paste, and bake it one hour. 

Fresh Cod may be done in the same way, by adding a litde 
salt. 

AH Fish for making Pies, whether Soles, Flounden, 
Herrings, Salmon,- Lobster, Eels, Trout, Tench, &c. should 
be dressed first ; this is the most Economical way for CathK^ 
&milies, as what is boiled one day, will make excellent Pies, 
or Patties the next. 

If you intend it for Pies, take the skin off, and the bones

out| ]ay ypuF Salmon, Soles, Turbot, or Cod-fish in layers, 
and season each layer with equal quantities of pepper, all- 
^ce, mace, and salt, till the dish is full, — save a little of the 
liquor that the fish was boiled in, set it on the fire with the 
bones and skin of the fish ; boil it a quarter of an hour, then 
strain it through a sieve, let it settle, and pour it in the dish, 
coyer it with puff paste, bake it about an hour and a quarter. 
Shrimps, prawns, or oysters added, will improve the above ; 
if for Patties, they must be cut in small pieces, and dressed 
in a Beshamell sauce, (No. 364.) 

Cod Sounds for a pie should be soaked at least twenty- 
four hours, then well washed, and put on a cloth to dry,— 
put in a stewpan two ounces of fresh butter, with four ounces 
of sliced onions, fry them of a nice brown, then put in a 
small table-spoonful of flour, and add half a pint of boiling 
water ; when smooth, put in about ten Cod-sounds, and sea- 
son them with a little pepper, a glass of white wine, a tea- 
s(xx>nful of Essence of Anchovy, the juice of half a lemon; 
stir it well together, put it in a pie-dish, cover it with paste, 
and bake it one hour.

Wash the Fish well,— wipe them on a dry cloth, — ^flour 
them lightly all over, and fry them ten minutes, see (No. 
145,) in hot lard or drippings ; lay them on a hair sieve to 
drain ; send them up on a hot dish, garnished with spri^ of 
green parsley. Anchovy sauce (No. 270,) and (No. 433.) 

Perch Boiled.— (^o. 160.) 

Clean them carefully, and put (hem in a fish-kettle, with 
^ much cold spring water as will cover them, with a handful 
of salt; set them on a quick fire till they boil; when they 
Wl, set them on one side to boil gently for about ten minutes, 
according to their size.

Vine^r (No. 24) ; let them rest for a day, fill up again, strtk* 
ina; the sides of the kit with a Cooper's Adze, until the lot 
wiU meeive no more — ^then head them down as close at 
possible. 

Obs, — This is in the finest condition vfhen freih, Salmon 
is most plentiful about Midsummer ; the season for it, is from 
February to September. Some sprigs of fresh gathered young 
Fennel-— are the accompaniments. 

N.B. The three indispensable marks of the goodness of 
Picked Salmon, are, 1st, — The brightness of the scales, and 
their sticking fest to the skin ; 2dly, The firmness of the flesh; 
and thirdly, its fine pale red rose colour : — ^without these it is 
not fit to eat, and was either stale before it ivas pickled, or 
has been kept too long after. 

The above was given us as the actual practice of those who 
pickle it for the London market. 

N.B. Pickled Fcdmon^ warmed by steam, or in its pickle 
liquor, is a fevourite dish at Newcastle.

* Sal MOV. The earliest that comes in seasoQ to the London mar- 
ket, is brought from the Severn, and begins to come into season the be- 
aming of November, but very few so early, perhaps not above one ia 
iUtf , as nany of them will not shoot their spawn till Januaiy, or after, 
and then continue in season till October, when they be^rin to g9t veiy 
thin aod poor. The principal supply of salmon is from different parts of 
Socftland, paclced in ice, uad brought by water : if the vessels have a fair 
wind, they will be in London in three days ; bnt it frequently happeiii 
that they are at sea perhaps a fortnight, when the greater part of the 
fish is p«*rished, and has, for a year or two past, sold as low as two- 
pence per pound, and up to as much as eighteen pence per pound at the 
same time, owing to iu different degrees of goodness. This acoooats 
for the very low prices at which the itinerant fishmongers cry their 
«* delicate Salmon,*' " dainty fresh Salmon," and ** Live Cod,** " Mfif 
Maekarei,** ifec. <fec

the Salmon you are going to dress, or the Salmon will neither 
kok nor taste well : (boil the Liver in a separate saucepan.) 
When the water boils, put in a handful of salt, take on the 
seam as soon as it rises, hare the €sh well washed, put it in, 
and if it is thick, let it boil very gently, Salmon requires al- 
most as much boiling as Meat, about a quarter of an hour to 
a pound of fish ; but practice only can perfect the Cook in 
dressing Salmon ; — a quarter of a Salmon will take almost as 
long boiling as half a one : you must consider the Thicknesi — 
not th Weight — ^ten pounds of fine full-grown ^Salmon will 
be done in an hour and a quarter. Lobster Sauce (No. 284.) 

Obs, — ^The thinnest part of the Fish, is. the fattest, and if 
you have a ** Grand Gourmand" at table, ask him if he is . 
for thick or Thin. 

The Thames Salmon is preferred in the London Market, 
and some Epicures pretend to be able to distinguish by the .

N.B. If you have any left^ put it into a pie-dish, and cover 
it with an equal portion of Vinegar and Pump- water, and a

Clean the Salmon well, and cut it into slices about an inch 
and a half thick ; dry it thoroushly in a cleaif cloih, rub it 
over with sweet oil, or thick melted butter, and sprinkle a 
little salt over it ; put your gridiron over a clear fire, at some 
distance; when it is Iwt, wipe it clean, rub it with sweet oil 
or lard ; lay the salmon on, and when it is done on one side, 
tuni it gently and broil the other. Anchovy sauce, &c. 

Olu* — An oven does them best. 



*' Salmon Gtoilts, or Salmon Peel, are the small salmon which come 
fltei about five or six pounds to ten pounds, are very good fish, and 
make handsome dishes offish, sent to table crooked in the form of an S/

214 FISH. 

Sole$ or EelSy* Sfc. ^c. stewed Wigoy's way. 

(No. 1 (54.) 

Take two pounds of fine silver f Eels ; — ^the best are those 
that are rather more than a half-crown piece in ciicmfr- 
ference, quite fresh, full of life, and ** as orisk as an Ed;^ 
sucll as have been kept out of water till they can scarce stir, 
are good for nothing. Gut them, rub them with salt till the 
slime is cleaned from them, wash them in several difierenl 
waters, and divide them into pieces about four inches long. 

Some Cooks, after skinning them, dredge them with a 
little flour, wipe them dry, and then egg and crumb them, 
and fry them in drippings till they are brown, and lay them 
to dry on a hair sieve. 

Have ready a quart of good Beef Gravy (No. 329) ; it mufit 
be cold when you put the Eels into it; set them on a slow 
fire to simmer very gently for about a quarter of an hour, 
according to the size of the eels ; — watch them that they are 
not done too much ; — take them carefully out of the stewpan 
with a fish slice, so as not to tear their coats, and lay them 
on a dish about two inches deep. 

Or, if /or Maigre Days, when you have skinned your 
Eels, throw the skins into salt and water, wash them well, 
and then put them into a stewpan with a quart of water, two 
onions, with two cloves stuck in each, and one blade of 
mace: let it boil twenty minutes, and strain it through a 
sieve in a basfn. 

Make the Sauce about as thick as cream, by mixing a little 
flour with it ; put in also two table-spoonsful of Port wine, 
and one of Mushroom Catsup, or Cavice ; stir it into tbe 
sauce by degrees, give it a boil, and strain it to the fish 
through a sieve. 

N.B. If Mushroom Sauce (Nos. 225, 305, or 333), ot 



* Small Fisband Fillets of Whiting, Turbots, Brills, <&c. and slkei 
o^Cod, or tbe head or tail of it, are excellent, dressed tbe same way. 

t The Yellow Eels taste maddy : the fFhiteneas of the belly of tbs 
fish, is not tbe only mark to know tbe best ; tbe right coloar of the back 
is a very bright coppery hue ; the Olive coloured are inferior ; and tbosv 
tending to a green are-worse. 



FnH^r 215 

White Sauce (No. 364, No. 2), be used instead of Beef 
Gravy, this will be one of the most relishing Maigre dishes 
we know, 

Obs. — To kill Eek instantly, without the horrid torture of 
cofitiBg and skinning them alive, pierce the spinal marrow, 
cbse to the back part of the skull, with a sharp pointed 
dc^er : if this be done in the right place, all motion will 
idstaiitly cease. — ^The humane Executioner does certain cri- 
ibmals the favour to hang them, before he breaks them on 
the wheel. 

To fry Eefo.— (No. 165.) 

Skin and gut them, and wash them well in coM water»s 
cut them in pieces four inches long, season them with pep- 
per and salt, beat an egg well on a plate, dip them in the 
egg, and then in fine bread crumbs ; fry them in fresh clean 
hffd, drain them well from the fat ; garnish with crisp pars- 
ley; — for Sattce, plain and melted butter, sharpened with 
lemon juice, or Parsley and Butter. 

Spitchcocked Eels, — (No. 166.) 

This the French Cooks call the English way of dressing 
Eds. 

Take two middling-sized silver Eels, leave the skin on, 
scour' fliem with salt, and wash them, cut off the heads, slit 
them on the belly side, and take out the bone and guts, and 
wash and wipe them nicely, then cut them into pieces about 
three inches long, and wipe them quite dry, put two ounces 
of butter into a stewpan with a little minced parsley, thyme, 
sage, pepper, and salt, and a very little chopped shallot ; set 
the stewpan over the fire ; when the butter is melted, stir 
the ingredients together, and take it off the fire, mix the, 
yolks of two eggs with them, and dip the Eel in, a piece at 
a time, and then roll them in bread crumbs, making as much 
stick to them as you can ; then rub a gridiron with a bit of 
twi, set it high over a very clear fire, and broil your Eels of 
a fine crisp brown : dish them with crisp parsley, and send 
up with plain butter in a boat, and anchovy and butter. 

Obs. — ^We like them better with the skin off; it is very 
apt to offend delicate stomachs. 



91Q FISH. 

Mackarel Boiled. — (No. 67.) 

This Fish loses its life as sood as it leaves the Sea^ and 
the fresher it is the better. 

Wash and dean them thoroughly^ (the fishmongers seldom 
do this sufficiently,) put them into cold water with a handfiil 
of salt in it ; let them rather simmer, than boil ; a smali 
markarel will be enough in about a quarter of an hour: 
when the Eye starts and the Tail splits, — ^they are done ; do 
not let them stand in the water a moment after ; they are so 
delicate, that the heat of the water will break them. 

This fish, in London, is rarely fresh enough to appear at 
table in perfection ; and either the Macharel is boiled too 
much, or the Roe* too little. The best way is to open a 
slit opposite the middle of the roe, you can then clean it 
propeiiy ; this will allow the water access, and the roe will 
then be done as soon as the fish, which it seldom is other- 
wise ; some sagacious gourmands insist upon it they must be 
taken out and boiled separately. For sauce, see (Nos. 263, 
265, and 266), and. you may garnish them with pats of 
minced Fennel. 

N. B. The common notion is, that Mackarel are in best 
condition when fullest of Roe ;— however, the Fish at that 
time is only valuable for its Roe,-^the Meat of it has scarcely 
any flavour. 

Macharel generally make their appearance oflf the Land^s 
End about the beginning of April ; and as the weather gets 
warm, they gradually come round the coast, and generally 
arrive off Brighton about May, and continue for some months, 
until they begin to shoot their spawn. 

After they have let go their Roes, they are called shotteo 
mackarel, and are not worth catching, the Roe, which was all 
that was good of them, being gone. 

It is in the early season^ when they have least Roe^ thai 
the fiesh of this Fish is in highest perfection. There is also 
an after-season, when s^ few fine large Mackarel are takea 

^ , , ^ 

* The Rasof the Male Fish it soft, like the brains of a Calf,— that 
of the Female is full of small eggs, ^nd called hard Roe. 



FISH. 217 

(t. €. during the Herring'season, about October,) which some 
piscivorous Epicures are very partial to, — ^these fish having 
' had time to fatten and recover their Health, are full of high 
flavour, and their flesh is firm and juicy : they are commonly 
called Stiver Mackarelt from their beautiful appearance, their ' 
colour being almost as bright when boiled, .as it was the ^ 
moment they were caught. 

Mackarel Broiled, — (No. 16P.) 

Clean a fine large mackarel, wipe it on a dry cloth, and . 
cut a long slit down the back j lay it on a clean gridiron, 
over a very clear slow fire ; when it is done on one sid^^ 
turn it ; be careful that it does not bum ; send it up with 
Fennel sauce (No. 265) ; mix well together a little finely 
minced Fennel and Parsley, seasoned with a little Pepper 
and Salt, a bit of fresh Butter, and when the Mackarel are . 
ready for the table, put some of this into each fish, 

Mackarel Baked. — (No. 170.) 

Cut off their heads, open them, and take out the roes and 
clean them thoroughly ; rub them on the inside with a little 
pepper and salt, put the roes in a^ain, season them (with a 
mixture of powdered allspice, black pepper and salt, well 
rubbed together), and lay them close in a baking pan, cover 
them with equal quantities of cold vinegar and water, tie 
them down with strong white paper doubled, and bake them . 
for an hour in a slow oven. They will keep for a fortpight. 

Pickled McLckarely Herrings, or Sprats. — (No. 171.) 

Procure them as fresh as possible, split them, take off the 
heads, and trim off the thin part of the belly, put them into 
salt arid water for one hour, drain and wipe your fish, and 
put them into jars or casks, with the following preparation, . 
which is enough for three dozen Mackarel. Take salt and 
bay salt, one pound each, saltpetre and lump sugar, two 
ounces each ; grind and pound the salt, &c. well together, 
put the fish into jars or casks, with a layer of the preparation 
at the bottom, then a layer of mackarel with the skin side 
downwards, so continue altemately till the cask or jar is fu)!; 
press it down and cover it close. In about three months they 
will be fit for use. 



218 FISH. 

. Sprcds Broiled.^(No. 170.*)— fnW, see (No. 173.) 

; If you have not a Sprat Gridiron, get a piece of pointed 
iron-wire as thick as packthread, and as long as your grid- 
iron is broad ;: run this through the heads of your sprats^ 
sprinkle a little flour and salt over them, — put your gridiroa 
over a clear quick fire, turn them in about a couple of mi- 
nutes ; when the other side is brown, draw out the wire> and 
send up the fish with melted butter in a cup. 

Obs.' — That Sprats are young Herrings, is evident by their 
anatomy, in which there is no perceptible difference. They 
appear very soon after the Hernngs are gone, and seem to be 
the spawn just vivified. 

Sprats 5<eu;crf.— (No. 1 70. **) 

Wash and dry your Spn ts, and lay them as level as you 
can in a stewpan, and between every layer of Sprats pat 
three peppercorns, and as many allspice, with a few grains 
of salt ; iMirely cover them with vinegar, and stew them one 
hour over a slow fire; they must not boil; a bay leaf is 
sometimes added. Herrings or Mackarel may be stewed the 
same way. 

To Fry Sprats, see (No. 173.) 

Herrings Broiled. — (No. 171 *.) 

Wash them well, then dry them with a cloth, du§t them 
with flour, and broil them over a slow fire till they are well 
done. Send up melted butter in a boat.

Red Herrings, and other Dried Fish — (No. 172.) 

" Should be cooked in the same manner now practised 
,by the Poor in Scotland. They soak them in water until 
they become pretty firesh ; they are then hung up in the Sun 
arid Wind, on a stick thrpugh their Eyes, to dry ; and then 
boiled or broiled. In this way, they eat almost as well as if 
they were n^w caught.*' — See the Hon. Jx>iin. Cpchrajnjb's

FISH/ 219 

■ " All the different sorts of Dried fishy except Stock Fiah, 

—«re salted, dried in the Sun, in prepared kilns,, or hy the 

smoke of wood fires; and require to be softened^ and 

freshened, in proportion to their bulk, nature, or dryness ; 

tbe very dry sort, as Cbd, Whiting, &c. should be steeped in 

lukewarm water, kept as near as possible to an equal degree 

of heat j The larger Fish should be steeped twelve hours: 

the smaller about two ; after which they should be taken out 

and hung up by the tails until they are dressed. The reason 

for baling them up is that they soflen equally as in the 

steeping, without extracting too much of the relish, which 

woold render them insipid. When thus prepared, the smaU 

Jahy as Whiting, Tusks, &c. should be floured and laid on 

the gridiron ; and when a little hardened on one side, must 

be turned and basted with sweet oil upon a feather; and 

when basted on both sides, and well heated through, taken 

up. A clear charcoal fire is the best for oooking them, and 

the Fish should be kept at a good distance to broil gradually. 

When they are enough they will swell a little in the basting, 

and you' must not let them fall again. If boiled, as. the 

larger fish generally are, they should be kept just simmering 

over an equal fire, in which way half an hour will do the 

largest fish, and five minutes the smallest. 

^^ Dried Salmon, though a large fish, does not require 
more steeping than a Whiting ; and when laid on the grid- 
iron should be moderately peppered. To Herring and to all 
kinds of broiled Salt Fish, sweet oil is the best basting.'* 

The above is from Macdonald's London Family Cook, 
8vo. 1808, p. 139. 

Obs, — Dr. Harte, in his Essay on Diet, 1633, folio, p. 91, 
protests " a Red Herring doth nourish little,, and is hard of 
concoction, but very good to make a cup of good drink relish 
^U, and may be weU called * The Drunkard* s Delight.' " 

SmeUs, Crudgeons, Sprats, or other small Fish fried. 

(No. 173.) 

Clean and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, fry them plain, 

^beat &n e^ on a plate, dip them in it, and then in very 

pe bredd criitobs that have been rubbed through a sieve ;

Biscuit Powder is still better ; fry them in plenty of clettn 
lard, or drippings ; as soon as the lard boils and is still , put 
in the fish, as soon as they are delicately browned, they arei 
done ; this will hardly take two minutes. Drain them on a 
hair sieve, placed before the fire, turning them till quite dry.

. " Smelts are allowed to be caught in the Thames, on the 
first of November, and continue till May. The Thames 
smelts are the best and sweetest, for two reasons ; they are- 
fresher and richer, than any other you can get : they catch 
them much more plentiful and lai^er in Lancashire and. Nor- 
folk, but not so good : a great many are brought to town from 
Norfolk, but barely come good, as they are a fish which should 
always be eaten fresh ; indeed all river Fish should be eaten 
fresh, except Salmon, which, unless crimped, eats better the 
second or third day : but all Thames fish, particularly, should- 
be eaten very fresh ; no fish eats so bad kept." 

Potted Prawns, Shrimpsy or Cray-Jish. — (No. 175.) 

Boil them in water, with plenty of Salt in it. When you 
have picked them, powder them with a little beaten mace, 
or grated nutmeg, or allspice, and pepper and salt; add a* 
little cold butterj and pound all well together in a marble

them till they are starved, before they boil them ; they are 
then watery, and have not half their flavour, and like other

to spawn, and seldom open solid. 

Cra6.— (No. 177.) 

The above observations apply to Crabs, which should 
neither be too small nor too large. The best size are those 
rwhich measure about eight inches across the shoulders. 

*^* Crabs appear and disappear about the same time as 
Lobsters^ The Cromer Crabs are most esteemed^ but num*

Potted Lobster or Cro^.— (No. 178.) 

, This must be made with fine Hen Lobsters when fall of 
spawn; boil them thoroughly, see (No. 176) ; when cold, 
pick out all the solid meat, and pound it in a mortar ; it is 

. usual to add, by degrees, (a very little) finely pounded mace, 
black or Cayenne pepper, salt, and, while pounding, a little 
butter. When the whole is well mixed, and beat to the 

• consistence of paste, press it down hard in a preserving*-

Obs. — Some put Lobster without pounding it, and only 

-cut. it or pull it into such pieces as if it was prepared for 
sauce, and mince it with the spawn and soft parts and sea- 

.soning, and press it together as close as possible ; in packing 
it place the coral and spawn, &c. in layers, so that it may 
look regular and handsome when cut out. If you intend it

OYSTERS*— (^0. 181.) 

The comipon f Colchester and Feversham Oyslers aie 
brought to market on thie 5th of August ; — ^the Milt<Ni, or as 
they are commonly called, the melting ^atttes^X do not 
come in till the beginning of October, continue in season till 
the 12th of May, and approach the meridian of their perfec- 
tion about Christmas. 

Some piscivorous Gourmands think that Oysters are not 
best when quite fresh from their beds, and that their flavour 
is too brackish and harsh, and is much ameliorated by giving 
them a feed, ^ 

To Peed§ Oysters. — Cover them with clean water, with 
a pint of salt to about two gallons (nothing else, no oatmeal, 
flour, nor any other trumpeiy) ; this will cleanse them from 
the mud and sand, &c. of the bed ; after they have lain in it 
twelve hours, change it for fresh salt and water, and ie 
twelve hours more they will be in prime order for the Mouth, 
and remain so two or three days : — at the time of high W^ter, 
you may see them open their shells, in expectation of receiv- 

* Oyster Sauce (No. 278), Preserved Oysters (No. 280). 

t Those are callpd Common Oysters which are picked up on tlie 
French coast^ and laid in the Colchester beds. 

These are never so fine and fat as the Natives^ and seldom lecover 
the shock their feelings receive^ from being tcansported from their na- 
tive place; — delicate little Creatures, they are as exquisite in their own 
taste, as they are to the taste of others .' 

I Oysters are thus called, that are bom, as well as bred and fed in 
this country> and are mostly ,spit in the Bumham and Mersey nvers; 
they do not come to their finest condition till they are near four yean 
old. 

§ Will Rabisha, in his Receipt to "hroil oysters,'* (see his 
Cookery, page 144), directs, that while they are undergoing this oper- 
ation, they should be fed with white wine and grated bread. 

In Boyle's Works, 4to. 1772. Vol. 2, p. 450, there is a very cu- 
rious Chapter on Eating op Otstbss,

itag their usual food. This process of feeding oysters, is only 
employed when a great many come up together. 

The REAL Colchester, or Pyfleet Barrelled Oysters^ 
that are packed at the beds, are better without being put iti 
water ; they are carefully and tightly packed, and must not 
be disturbed till wanted for table: these, in moderate 
weather, will keep good for a week or ten days. 

If an Oyster opens his mouth in the barrel, he dies imme- 
diately. 

To preserve the lives of Barrelled Oysters^ put a heavy 
weight on the wooden top of the barrel, which is to be placed 
on the surface of the oysters. This is to be effected by re- 
moving the hrst hoop, the staves will then spread and stand 
erect, making a wide opening for the head of the barrel to 
liadl down closely on the remaining fish, keeping them close 
together. 

Mem. — ^The Oysters which are commonly sold as Bani- 
relied Oystersj are merely the smallest natives, selected from 
the stock, and put into the . Tub when ordered ; and, in- 
stead of being of superior quality, are often very inferior. 
To immature Animals, there is the same objection, as to un- 
ripe vegetables. 

Obs. — Common people are indifferent about the manner 
of opening Oysters, and the time of eating them after they are 
opened ; nothing, however,, is more important in the enlight- 
ened eyes of the experienced Oyster eater. 

Those who wish to enjoy this. delicious restorative in-ifs 
utmost perfection, must eat it the moment it is opened^ with 
its own gravy in the under shell : — if not Eaten while Mso- 
ItUely Alive, its flavour and spirit are lost. 

The true lover of an Oyster, will have some regard for the 
feelings of his little favourite, and will never abandon it to 
the mercy of a bungling operator, — ^but will open it himself, 
and contrive to detach the Fish from the shell so dexterously, 
that the Oyster is hardly conscious he has been ejected from 
his Lodging, till he feels the teeth of the piscivorous GouT" 
mand tickling him to death. 

• N. B. Fish is less nutritious than Flesh : as a proof, when 
the trainer of Newmarket wishes to waste a Jockey, he is not 
allowed Meat, not even Pudding, if Fish can be had. The 



224 FISH. 

white kinds of Fish, Turbots, Soles, Whiting, Cod,I&dd6cK 
Flounders, Smelts, &c. are less nutritions than the oily £at 
Fish, such as Eels, Salmon, Herrings, Sprats, &c. ; the lat- 
ter, however, are more difficult to digest, and often disturb 
weak stomachs, so that they are obliged to call in the assist- 
. ance of Cayenne^ CogntaCy 6cc. 

Shell Fish have long held a high rank in the catalc^ue 
.of easily digestible and speedily restorative foods; of these 
the Oyster certainly deserves the best character,— but, wc 
think it has acquired not a little more reputation for these 
qualities than it deserves; a well-dressed Chop* or Steak, 
see (No. 94), will invigorate the Heart in a much higher 
ratio i-r^o racruit the Mnimal spirits^ and support strength, 
there is nothing equal to Animal food, — when kept till pro- 
perly tender, none will give so little trouble to the Digestive 
organs, and so much substantial excitement to the Constito- 
tion. See note under (No. 185*).

V 

Beef Broth*-^[m. IS5,) 

Wash a Leg or a Shin of Beef very clean, crack the bone 
in two or three places, (this you should desire the Butcher 
to do for you,) add thereto any trimmings you have of Meat, 
Game, or Poultiy, (u c. heads, necks, gizzards, feet, &c.) 
and cover them with cold water, — ^watch and stir it ikp well 
from the bottom, and the moment it begins to simmer^ skim 
it carefully — ^your Broth must be perfectly clear and limpid, 
on this depends the goodness ef the SoupSy Sauces^ and 
Gravies J of which it is the basis : — then add some cold water 
to make the remaining scum rise, and skim it again ; wh^n 
the scum has done rising, and the surface of the Broth is 
quite clear, put in one moderate-sized Carrot, a head of Ce- 
lery, two Turnips, and two Onions, — ^it should not l^ave any 
taste of sweet herbs, spice, or garlic, &c., either of these 
flavours can easily be added immediately after, if desired, by 
(Nos. 420, 421, 422, &c.)— cover it close, set it by the side 
of the fire, and let it simmer very gently (so as not to waste 
the Broth) for four or five hours, or more, according to the 
weischt of the Meat : — strain it through a sieve into a clean 
and dry, storie pan, and set it in the coldest place you have; 

Obs, — This is the foundation for all sorts of Soups and 
Sauces, brown or white. 

Stew Tio longer than the Meat is thoroughly done to eat^ 
and you will obtain excellent Broth, without depriving the 
Meat of its nutritious succulence : — to boil it to rags, as is

The Meat,* when gently stewed for only four or five hours 
till it is just tender, remains abundantly sapid and nourishing, 
and will afford a relishing and wholesome meal for balf a

or five pounds of Gravy Beef cut into half-pound pieces, a 
Carrot, an Onion witb two Cloves stuck in it, and a head of 
Celery ; put a pint of Broth or water to it, coyer it close, and 
set it over a moderate fire till the water is reduced to as little 
as will just save the ingredients from burning ; then tarn it 
all about, and let it brown slightly and equally all over; — 
then put in three quarts of boiling water j J when it boib

the desired thickness ; or add a bit of glaze or Portable Soup 
to it, see (No. 252 :) if it is too TTiick, you can easily thin it 
with a spoonful or two of warm broth, or water. When your 
sauce is done, stir it in the basin you put it into once or twice, 
while it is cooling. 

FeaZ BrotA.— (No, 191.) 

A Knuckle of Veal is best ; manage it as directed in the 
receipt for Beef Broth (No. 185,*) only take care not to let 
it catch any colour, as this and the following and richer 
preparation of Veal, is chiefly used for White Soups, 
Sauces, &c. 

To make White Sauce, see (No. 364.)* 

Veal GVary.— (No. 192.) 

About three pounds of the nut of the Leg of Veal, cut into 
half pound slices, with a quarter of a pound of Ham in small 
dice ; proceed as directed for the Beef Gravy (No. 186,) but 
watch the time of putting in the water ; if this is poured in 
too soon, the gravy will not have its true flavour, — ^if it be let 
alone till the meat sticks too much to the pan, it will catch 
too brown a Colour.

two turnips, a head of celery, two large onions, with two or 
three cloves stuck in one of them, a dozen corns of Black, 
and the same of Jamaica pepper, and a good bundle of lemon 
thyme, winter savory, and parsley. — ^Just cover the meat with 
cold water, and set it over a quick fire till it boils ; having 
skimmed it well, remove your soup-kettle to the side of the 
fire, let it stew very gently till it is quite tender, t. e. about 
f<mt hours ; then tsuce out the bacon and veal, strain the soup, 
and set it by in a cool place till you want it, when you must 
take off the fat from the surface of your liquor, and decant it 
(keeping back the settlings at the bottom) into a clean pan. 

If you- like a Thickened Soup, put three table-spoonsful 
of the ^ you have taken off the soup, into a small stewpan, 
and mix it with four table-spoonsful of flour, pour a ladleful 
of soup to it, and mix it with the rest by degrees, and boil it 
up till it is smooth.

Mutton firoi/i.— (No. 194.) 

Take jtwo pounds of Scrj^ of Mutton ; to take the blood out, 
put it into a stewpan, and cover it with cold water ; when, the 
water becomes milk->varm, pour it off, then put it in four or 
five pints of water, a tea-spoonful of salt, a table-spoonful of 
best grits, and an Onion ; set it on a slow fire, and when you 
have taken all the scum off, put in two or three turnips, let 
it simmer very slowly for two hours, and strain it through si

The three following Receipts are the contribution of a 
friend at Edinburgh. 

Winter Hatch Potch, 

Take the best end of a neck or loin of Mutton, cut it into 
neat chops, cut four carrots and as many turnips into slices, 
put on four quarts of water, with half the carrots and turnips, 
and a whole one of each, with a pound of dried green peas, 
which must be put to soak the night before, — let it boil two 
hours, then take out the whole carrot and turnip, bruise and 
return them, put in the meat, and the rest of the carrot and 
turnip, some pepper and salt, and boil slowly three-quarters 
of an hour; a short time before serving add an onion cut 
' small, and a head of celery. 

Cocky-Leeky Soup, 

Take a scrag of Mutton, or shank of Veal, three quails 
of water (or liquor in which meat has been boiled), and a 
godd sized fowl, with two or three leeks cut in pieces about 
an inch long, pepper and salt, boil slowly about an hour, 
then put in as many more leeks, and give it three-quarters of 
an hour longer : — ^this is very good, made of good beef stock, 
and leeks put in at twice. 

Lamb Stove or Lamb Stew, 

Take a Iambus head and lights, open the jaws of the head, 
and wash them thoroughly, put them in a pot with some beef 
stock, made with three quarts of water, and two pounds of 
shin of beef, strained, boil very slowly for an hour, wash and 
string two or three good handsful of spinach (or Spina^), 
put it in twenty minutes before serving, add a little parsley, 
-and one or two onions a short time before it comes off the 
fire, season with pepper and salt, and serve all together in a 
tureen.

Scrape and wash half a dozen large Carrots, peel off the 
red outside (which is the only part used for this soup) ; put 
it into a gallon stewpan, with one head of Celery, and an 
Onion, cut into thin pieces ; take two quarts of Beef, VeaJ, 
or Mutton Broth, or if you bave any cold Roast Beef Bones 
(or liquor, in which Mutton or Beef bas been boiled), you 
may naake very good broth for this soup : — when you have 
put the brotb to the roots, cover the stewpan close, and set 
it on a slow stove for two hours and a half, when tfie Car- 
rots will be soft enough (some Cooks put in a Tea-cupful of 
Bread crumbs), boil for two or three minutes, rub it through 
atammis, or hair sieve, with a wooden spoon, and add as 
much broth as will make it a proper thickness, i. e. almost 
as thick as pease soup : put it into a clean stewpan, make it 
hot, season it with a little salt, and send it up with some 
toasted bread, cut into pieces, half an inch square. Some 
put it into the soup ; but the best way is to send it up on a 
plate,' as a side dish.

pare ; — in the Kitchens of some opulent Epicures, to make 
this Soup make a little stronger impression on the gustatory 
Organs of " Grands Gourmandsy^ the Celery and Onions 
are sliced, and fried in butter of a light brown, the Soup is

drain, and put them into three quarts of (No. 200) in a gal- 
lon soup pot ; set it by the side- of the fire, to stew very

of the Seedy pounded fine, which may be considered as the 
Essence of Celery, (costs only one-third of a farthing, aad 
cAn be had at any season,) put in a quarter of an hour be- 
fore the soup is done, and a little sugar will give as much

Green Pease Soup, — (No. 216.) 

A peck of Pease will make you a good tureen of Soup, — in 
shelling them put the old ones in one Basin, and the young 
ones in another, and keep out a pint of them, and boil them 
separately to put into your Soup when it is finished ;— put a 
large saucepan on the fire half full of water, when it boik, 
put the Pease in, with a handful of salt ; let thera boil till 
they are done enough, i, e. from twenty to thirty minutes, 
according to their age and size, then drain them in a ciiilen-

Plain Green Pease Soup without Meat. — (No. 217.) 

Take a quart of Green Pease (keep out half a pint of the 
youngest, boil them separately, and put them in the Soap 
when it is finished), put them on in boiling water, boil them 
tender, and then pour off the water and set it by to make the . 
soup with ; put the peas into a mortar, and pound them to 
a mash. Then put them into two quarts of the water you 
boiled the peas in, stir all well together, let it boil up for 
about five minute^, and then rub it through a hair sieve or 
tammis. If the peas are good, it will be as thick and fine a 
vegetable soup as need be sent to table. 

Pease Soup,— (No. 218.) 

The common way of making Pease Soup* is, — to a Quart 
of Split Pease put three quarts of cold soft water, not more, 
(or it will be what "jack ros-bif" calls " Soup Maigre^*^) - 
notwithstanding Mother Glasse orders a gallon (and her 
L^dyship^s ■ directions have been copied by almost every 
Cookery book-maker, who has. strung receipts together since), 
with half a pouAd of Bacon* (not very fat), or Roast Beef 
bones,. or four Anchovies: or, instead of the water, three, 
quarts of the Liquor, in which Beef, Mutton, Pork, or Poultry 
has been boiled, tasting it first, to make sure it is not too 
saltf. 

* To roak^ PsASB Pottao b, double the quantity. Those who often 
make Peose Soup, should have a Mill, and grind the Pease, just before 
tliej drei!8.t)ieai,'-aless quantity will suffiue> and the Soup will be much 
<ooner inacie.

Wash two heads of Celery,* cut it, and put it in, wit 
two Onions peeled, and a sprig of Savory, or sweet " 
joram, or Lemon-Thyme ; set it on the trivet, and let li 
simmer very gently over a slow fire, stirring it every qx 
df an hour (to keep the pease from sticking to and burning 
the bottom of the Soup-pot) till the Pease are tender, whic) 
will be in about three hours ;— some Cooks now slice a he 
of Celery, and half an ounce of Onions, and fry them in 
little butter, and put them into the Soup, till they are lightl 
browned, then work the whole through a coarse hair sievej 
and then through a fine sieve, or (what is better) through : 
tammis, with the back of a wooden spoon ; — ^put it into 
clean stewpan, with half a tea-spoonful of ground Black Pej

skim it off. 

Send up on a plate, Toasted Bread cut into little pieces, 
quarter of an inch square, or cut a slice of bread (that '

take care and turn it about with a slice, or by shaking off

06«:— 7%e most Economical method of making Pease 
Soup, is to save the hones of a joint of Roast Bieef, and 
put theiii into the liquor in which Mutton, or Beef, or Pork, 
or Poultry, has heen boiled, and proceed as in the above 
receipt. A hock, or shank bone of Ham, a ham bone, the 
root of a Tongue, or a red or pickled Herring, are £aivourite 
additions virith some Cooks; others send up Rice, or Vermi- 
celli, with Pease Soup. ♦ 
N; B. To make Pease Soup ExfEMPORE, see (No. 655). 
If you wish TO make Soup the same day you Boil 
Meat or Poultry, prepare the Pease the same as for 
Petue Pudding (No. 555), to which you may add an Onion 
and a head of Celery, when you rub the pease through the 
sieve,— instead of putting E|^ and Butter, add some of the 
liquor from the pot to make it a proper thickness, — put it on 
to boil for five minutes, and it is ready. 

Obs, — Tkis latter is by far the easiest ^ and the best way of 
making Pease Soup* 

Pease Soup may be made savoiuy zM agreeable to the 
Ddate, without any Meat, by incorporating two ounces of 
fresh and nicely clarified Befef, Mutton, or Pork drippings, 
see (No. 83), with two ounces of Oatmeal, and mixmg this 
well into the gallon of Soup, made as above directed : see 
also (No. 229.)

Plain Pease Soup. — (No. 221.) 

To a quart of split Pease, and two heads of Celery, (and 
most Cooks would put a large Onion,) put three quarts of 
Broth or soft water ; let them simmer gently on a trivet over 
a slow fire for three hours, stirring up every quarter of an 
hour to prevent the pease burning at the bottom of the soup- 
kettle, — if the water boils away and the Soup gets too thio^, 
add sdme boiling water to it) ;— when they are well softened, 
work them through a coarse sieve, and then through a fine 
sieve or a tammis, wash out your siewpan, and then retum 
the Soup into it, and give it a boil up; take off any scum 
that comes up, and it is ready. Prepare fried Breads and 
dried Mint, as directed in (No. 218), and send them up with

So, the Two Quarts cost One Shilling ;-^balf a drachm

Most of the Receipts for Pease Soup, are crowded with 
ingredients which entirely overpower the flavour of the Pease. 
See (No. 555). 

Asparagus Soup, — (No. 222.) 

This is made with the points of Asparagus, in the same 
manner as the Green Pease Soup (No. 216 or 17) is with 
pease ; let half the Asparagus be rubbed through a sieve, 
and the other cut io pieces about an inch long, and boiled 
till done enough, and sent up in the soup; to make two 
quarts, there must be a pint of heads to thicken it, and half 
a pint cut in, — ^take care to preserve these green and a little 
crisp. This soup is sometimes made by adding the aspara^ 
gos heads to common Pease soup. 

Obs. — Some Cooks fry half an ounce of onion in a little 
butter, and rub it through a sieve, and add it with the other 
ingredients, — ^the haul goiU of the Onion will entirely over- 
come the clelicate flavour of the Asparagus, and we protest 
against all such combinations.

their 'children of that wholesome nourishmeDt which is ne- 
cessary, for the purpose of rearing them up to matori^ in 
Health and Strength. 

The labouring classes seldom purchase what are called the 
coarser pieces of Meat, because they do not know how to 
dress them, but lay out their money in pieces .for Roasting, 
&c., of which the bones, &c. enhance the price of the ac- 
tual meat to nearly a shilling per pound, and the diminiUum 
of weight by Roasting amounts to 32 per cent. This, fw 
die sake of saving time, trouble, and fire, is generally sent 
to an oven to be Baked, the nourishing parts are evaporated 
and dried up, its weight is diminished nearly one^third^ and 
all that a poor man can afford td purchase with his week's 
earnings, perhaps does not half satisfy the a^ppetites of him- 
self and family for a couple of dajrs. 

If a hard-working man cannot get a comfortable meal at 
home, he soon finds his way to the Public-house, — ^the poor 
wife contents herself with Tea and Bread aiid Butter, and 
the children are half starved. 

Dr. Kitchiner^s Receipt to make a cheap, nutritive,

the means of renderii^ a scanty pittance capable of yielding 
a comfortable variety. 

Change of Flavour is absolutely necessary — ^not n^erely as 
a matter of pleasure and comfort, but of Health — Toujours 
Perdrix is a true proverb. 

This Soup will be m^ich iinint)ved, if, instead of water, it 
be made with the \iqmt Meat has been boiled in ; — at Tripe, 
Cow-heel, and Cook shops, this may be had for little or 
nothing. 

This Soup has the advantage of being very soon and easily 
made, with no more fuel than is necessary to warm a room— 
those who have not tasted it, cannot imagine what a Savoury 
and Satisfying Meal is produced by the combination of these 
cheap and homely in^$dients. 

If the gen^ily received opinion be true, that Animal and 
Vegetable foods afford nourishment in proportion to the 
quantity of Oil, Jelly, and Mucilage that can be extracted

The best parts for this purpose, are the Leg or Shin, or a 
piece of the middle of a Brisket of Beef, of about seven or 
eight pounds weight ; lay it on a fish drainer, or when yoo 
take it up, put a slice under it, which will enable yon to 
place it on the dish entire ; put it into a soup*pot or deep 
stewpan, with cold water enough to cover it, and a qtaort 
over, set it on a quick fire to get the scum up, which resiDve 
as it rises ; then put in two carrots, two turnips, two leebk 
or two large onions, two heads of celery, two or three cloves, 
and a faggot of parsley and sweet herbs ; ^et the pot by the 
side of the fire to simmer very gently, till the meat is Just 
tender enough to eat; this will require about four or five 
hours. 

Put a large carrot, a turnip, a large (Hiion, and a head or 
two of celery, into the soup whole, — ^take them out as soon 
as they are done enough, lay them on a dish till they are 
cold, then cut them into small squares: — when the Beef is 
done, take it out carefully, — ^to dish it up, see (No. 204, or 
493), strain the Soup through a hair sieve into a clean stew- 
pan, take off the Fat, and put the Vegetables that are cot 
into the Soup, the flavour of which you may heighten, li]f 
adding a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup. 

If a Thickened Soup is preferred, take four laxge table- 
spoonsful of the clear Fat from the top of the pot, and four 
spoonsful of Flour ; mix it smooth together, then by degrees 
stir it well into the soup, which simmer for ten minuleB

Put into a gallon stewpan, eight Cloves, iyfro or .three

take out the meat and cut it off the bones, in neat mouthfuls,

Ox Heel iSotip.— (No. 240.)* 

Must be made the day before it is eaten. Procure an Ox 
Heel undressed, or only scalded, (not one that has been 
already boiled, as they are at the Tripe shops, till alhiost all 
the gelatinous parts are extracted), and Two that have been 
boiled as they usually are at the Tripe shops. 

Cut the meat off the boiled heels into neat mouthfuk, and 
set it by on a plate ; put the trimmings and bones into a 
fltewpan, with three quarts of water, and the unboiled heel 
cut into quarters ; — furnish a stewpan . with two onions and 
two turnips pared and sliced, pare off the red part of a 
couple of lai^ carrots, add a couple of eshallots cut in half, 
a bunch of savory, or lemon-thvme, and double the quan- 
tity of parsley ; set this over or oy the side of a slow steady 
fire, and keep it closely covered and simmering very gently 
(or the soup-liquor will evaporate), for at least seven houn ; 
during which, take care to remove the fat and scum that wiM

stantial dish, may introduce a couple of sets of Goose or 
Dndk Gibblets, or Ox tsdls^ or a pound of Veal Cutlets, cut 
into mouthfuls. 

Hare^ Rabbity or Partridge ^Sbtip.— (No. 241.) 

An old Hare, of Birds, when so tough as to defy the 
teeth in any other form, will make very good Soup. 

Cut off the legs and shoulders, divide the body cross ways, 
and stew them very gently in three quarts of water, with One 
carrot, about one ounce of onion, with four cloves, two 
blades of pounded mace, twenty-four black peppers, and a 
boncUe of sweet herbs, till the Hare is tender, (most Cooks 
add to the above a couple of slices of Ham or Bacon, and a 
Bay Leaf, &c. but my Palate and Purse both plead against 
sudi extravE^nce, the Hare makes sufficiently savoury Soup 
without them) ; the time this will take depends very much 
upon its age, and how long it has been kept before it is 
dressed ; as a general rule about three hours ; in the mean- 
time, make a dozen and a half of nice forcemeat balls (as 
big as Nutmegs) of (No. 379) ; when the Hare is quite 
tender, take the meat off the Back, and the upper joint of the 
Legs, cut it into neat mouthfuls, and lay it aside ; cut the 
rest of the meat oflf the legs, shoulders, &c. mince it, and 
pound it in a mortar, with ai ounce of butter, and two or 
tliree table-spoonsful of flour moistened with a little Soup ; 
rub this through a hair sieve, and put it into the Soup to 
thicken it ; — ^let it simmer slowly half an hour longer, 
aikimming it well,; — put it through the Tammis, into the pan 
again, — and put; in the meat with a glasa of claret or Port 
wine, and a table-spoonful of Currant Jelly to each quart of 
Soup, — reason it with salt, put in the forcemeat bans, and 
when all is well warmed, the Soup is ready.

Game 5(wp.— (No. 242.) 

in the Game Season, it is easy for a Cook to giie heir 

roaster a very good Soup at a very little expence, l^ taking 

all the Meat m the Breasts of any cold Birds which have 

been left the prece<Ung day, and pounding it in a mortar, 

uid beating to pieces the legs and bones, and boiling them 

ia some brotii for an hour. Boil six turnips, mash them, 

and strain them through a tammis cloth with the meat that 

•has been pounded in a mortar, strain your broth, and put a 

Htde of it at a time into the tammis, to help you to strain all 

of it through. Put your soup-kettle near the fire, but dp not 

let it boil ; when ready to dish your dinner, have six yolks 

of qgs mixed with half a pint of cream, strain through a 

sieve, put your soup on the fire, and as it is coming to a boil, 

put in the eggs, and stir well with a wooden spoon ; do not 

let it boil, or it will curdle.

age of the Giblets : — ^take them up with a skimmer, or a 
^poon full of holes, put them into the tureen, and coyer down

To Thicken the Soup. — Melt an ounce and a half of 
butter in a clean stewpan, stir in as much Flour as will make 
it into a paste ; then pour to it by d^rees a ladleful of the 
Giblet liquor, add the remainder by degrees, let it boil about 
half an hour, stirring it all the whiles for fear it should bora, 
— «kim it and strain it through a fine sieve into a B^n,—

season it with a Glass of Wine^ a table-spoonful o£ Mush-

0&f.«— Thus managed, one set of Goose or two of Dwk 
Giblets (which latter may sometimes be had for 3(2.,) .wiH 
make a Quart of healthful, nourishing Soup : if you think 
the Giblets alone will not make the Gravy savoury enough, 
add a pound of Beef, or Mutton, or bone of a knuckle of 
Veal, and heighten its *^ piquaivxi*^ by adding a few leaves 
of sweet Basil, the juice of half a Seville orange or lemon, 
and half a glass of Wme, and a little of (No. 343*) to each 
quart of Soup. 

Those who are fond of Forcemeat, may slip the akin dR 
the neck, and fill it with (No; 378,) tie up die other end 
tight, put it into the soup about half an hour before you take 
it up, or make some nice savoury Balls of the Diick stiiffing 
(No. 61.) 

06<.^-Bespeak the Giblets a couple of days before you de- 
sire to have them ; this is a favourite Soup when the Giblets 
are done till nicely tender, but yet not overboiled. Giblets 
may be had from July to January, — the fresher they are, the 
better.

these, see (No. 375) or (No. 376), (No. 390 to No. 396), 

we prefer the stuffing ordered in (No. 61), and a dozen Egg 

balls; and put them into the tureen. Brain Balls, or 

cdces, are a very elegant addition, and are made by boiUi^ 

the brains for ten minutes, then putting them in cold water, 

vA cutting them into pieces about as big as a large nutmeg ; 

take Savory, or Lemon-thyme dried and finely powdered, 

nutmeg grated, and pepper and salt, and pound them all 

together ; beat up an e^, dip the brains in it, and then roll 

them in this p)ixture, and make as much of it as possible

N. B. In helping this Soup, the distributor of it shookt 
serve out the Meat, — ^Forcemeat, — and Gravy, — ^in equal 
parts ; however trifling or needless this remark may app>eary 
the writer has often suffered from the want of such a hint 
being given to tlie Soup-servei', who has sometimes sent a 
plate of mere Gravy without Meat, — at others, of Meal 
without Gravy, and sometimes scarcely any thing but Force- 
meat Balls. 

Obs. — This is a delicious Soup, within the reach of those 
who ** eat to live ;'* but if it had been composed expressly 
for those who only *Mive to eat," I do not know now it 
could have been made more agreeable : as it is, the lover of 
good eating will •' wish his Throat a mile long, and every

Portable ♦ Soup, — w Glaze. — (No. 252.) 

Desire the Butcher to break the bones of a Leg or, a Shin 
of Beef, of ten pounds weight (the fresher killed the better), 
put it into a Soup-pot (a Digester f is the best utensil for 
this purpose) that will well hold it; just cover it with cold 
water, and set it on the fire to heafgradually till it nearly 
boils, (this should be at least an hour) ; — skim it attentively 
while any scum rises,-— pour in a little cold water, to throw 
up the scum that may remain, — let it come to a boil again, 
and again skim it carefully : when no more scum rises, and 
the broth appears clear, (put in neither Roots nor Herbs nor 
Salt,) let it boil for eight or ten houirs, and then strain it 
through a hair sieve into a brown stone pan ; set the Broth 
where it will cool quickly ; put the meat into a sieve, let it 
drain, make Potted Beef (No. 503),— or it will be very ac- 
ceptable to many poor families. Next day remove every 
particle* of Fat from the top of it, and pour it ftrough a 
tammis or fine sieve as quietly as possible into a Stewpan, 
taking care not to let any of the settlings at the bottom of the 
stone pan go into the Stewpan, which should be of thick 
Copper, perfectly well tinned ; add a quarter of an ounce of 

* '' A pound of meat contains about an ounce of gelatinous mattei ; 
it tbeoce follows, that 1500 pounds of the same meat, which is 11m 
whole weight of a bullock, would give only 94 pounds, which migftt 
be easily contained in an earthen Jar." — Dr. Hdtton's BationaiRi- 
creations, vol. iv. p. 194. 

In what degree Portable or other Soup be nutritious, we know not, 
b«t refer the reader to onr note under (No, IS6.*) 

f This machine was invented by Dr. Denys P^io, F. R. S., about 
the year 1631, as appears by his Essay on "^ Tke Nm Diffe»ier,§r 
Engine /or Softening Bones," '^by the help of which, (he says) the 
oid^ and hardest Cow Beef may be made as tender and as savoury is 
young and choice Meat.'' Cast Iron Digesters are made at«AiciltsMi 
and Moaer*s, in Frith-street, Soho. 

Although we have not yet found that they do what Dr. Papin aiyi^ 
<' make old and tough Meat — young d tender,'* they are, however* 
eicellent things to make Broths and Soups in. Among a multitude of 
other admirable excellencies obtainable by his Digester, Da. Pafiv 
in page 54, of his 9th Chapter, on the Profit that a good Bngine may 
come to, says, *' I have found that An Qtd Hat, very bad and loosely 
made, having imbibed the Jelly of Bones, became very firm and stiff."

whole Black Pepper to it, let it boil briskly, with the stew- 
pan uncovered, on a quick fire : if any scum rises, take it 
off with a skimmer; when it begins to thicken, and is re- 
duced to about a quart, put it into a smaller stewpan ; set it 
over a gentler fire, till it is reduced to the thickness of a 
very thick Syrup ; take care that it does not bum, — a mo^ 
fi^ient*s inattention now will lose you cUl your labour^ and the 
soup will be spoiled: — take a little of it out in a spoon and 
kt it cool ; if it sets into a strong Jelly, it is done' enough ; — 
if it does not, boil it a little longer till it does ; — have ready 
some little pots, such as are used for Potted Meats, about an 
inch and a half deep, taking care that they are quite dry; — 
we lecommend it to be kept in these pots, if it is for home 
consumption — [the less it is reduced tlte better is the flavour 
of the Soup) — if it be sufficiently concentrated to keep for 
six months ; — if you wish to preserve it longer, put it into 
such bladders as are used for German Sausages, or if you 
prefer it in the form of Cakes, pour it into a dish about a 
quarter of an Inch deep ; when it is cold, turn it out and 
weigh the Cake, and divide it with a paste-cutter into pieces 
of half an ounce and an ounce each ; place them in a warm 
room, and turn them frequently till they are thoroughly 
dried ;— ^this will take a week or ten days ; turn them twice 
a day ; — when well hardened, and kept in a dry place, they 
may be preserved for several years in any climate. 

This extract of Meat makes excellent ^' Tablettes de Bou- 
tOon," for those who are obliged to endure long fasting. 

If the surface becomes mouldy, wipe it with a little warm 
water, the mouldy taste does not penetrate the mass. 

If, after several days* drying, it does not become so hard 
as you wish, put it into a Bainmarie Stewpan, or Milk-boiler^ 
(these are made by Lloyd, Tinman, near Norfolk-street, 
Strand), till it is evaporated to the consistence you wish- 
er, set the Pots in a cool Oven, or in a Cheese-toasterj at a 
considerable distance from the fire ; this is the only safe way 
of reducing it very much without the risk of its burning, and 
acquiring an extremely disagreeable acrid flavour, &c. 

Obs. — The uses of this concentrated Essence of Meat are 
numerous. It is equally economical and convenient for 
making extempore Broths enumerated in the Obs. to (No. 200),

Sauces and Gravies for Hashed or Stewed Meat, Game, or 
Poultry, &c. 

You may thicken it and flavour it as directed in (No. 329); 
— to make Gravy^ Sauces, &c. take double the quantity or- 
dered for Broth. 

If you have time and opportunity, ds there is no seasoning 
iti the Soup, either of Roots, Herbs, or Spice, boil an 
Onion with or without a bit of Parsley and Sweet Herbs, 
and a few corns of Allspice, or other Spice, in the water yon

Catsup (No. 439),— or Eshallot Wine (No. 402),— Essence 
of Sweet Herbs (No. 417),— Savoury Spice (No. 421, or 
457),— Essence of Celery (No. 409), &c. or Zest (No. 265) ; 
these fhay be combined in the proportions most agreeable to 
the palate of the Eater — and are as portable as Portable Soup, 
for a verv small portion will flavour a Pint. 

The fiditor adds nothing to the solution of this Soup, but 
a very httle ground Black Pepper and some Salt. 

N. B. If you are a careful manager, you need not always 
purchase Meat on purpose to make thrs,— 4/'Aen you dress a 
large Dinner ^ you can make Glaze at very small cost, by 
taking care of the trimmings and parings of the meat, game, 
and poultry you use ; wash them well, put them into a Stew- 
pan, cover them with the liquor you hare boiled Meat in, 
and proceed as in the above Receipt; and fee Obs. on 
(No. 185). 

Mem. This Portable Soup is a most convenient article 
in Cookery — especially in Small Families^ where it will 
save a gVeat deal of time and trouble. It is also Economieal^ 
for no more will be melted than is wanted — so there is no 
waste. 

Xine pounds of Keck of Beef costing 2^. 7\d. produced 
nine ounces of very nice Soup, the Bones, when boiled, 
weighed ten ounces. 

Half an Ox Clieeky costing 1*. 9c?. and weighing 14 j 
pounds, produced thirteen ounces — but not so firm or ctear, 
and far inferior in flavour to that obtained from a Shin of 
Beef. 

' J Sheep*s Head, costing 9cf., produced three ounces and 
a half. 



. BROTHS, ORAVlBSy ANt) SOUPS. 267 

Two pounds of lean Meat^ from the Blade Bone of Beef, 
produced hardly an ounce. 

The addition of an ounce of Crum Arabic, and two ounces 
oilsinglttsi, to four ounces of the extract from a Leg of Beef, 
considerably diminished the consistence of the mass, with- 
out adding to its bulk. 

It has been thought that the Portable Soup which is ma- 
nufactured for sale — is partly made with Ox Heels; but the 
experiment (No. 19S), proves this cannot be,* as an ounce of 
the Jelly from Ox Heel costs bd. For the cheapest method 
of procuring a hard JeUy, see N. B. to (No, 481) ; — nineteen 
Bones, costing \\d. produced three ounces: — almost as 
cheap as Salisbury Glue. 

We are informed, that there is now for sale at Leipsig — 
som^ Tons of Portable Soup — for Two shillings per pound. 
During the late war, there was a great deal imported into 
this country from Russia. 

J Knuckle of Veal, weighing 4^ pounds, and costing 
2s, Ad produced five ounces. , 

A Shin of Beef, weighing nine pounds, and costing 
1«. \0\d, produced nine ounces of concentrated Soup, suffi- 
ciently reduced to keepfpr several months. After the boil- 
ing, the bones in this joint weighed two pounds and a quar- 
ter, and the Meat two pounds and a quarter. 

The result of these experiments is, that the product from 
Legs and Shins of Beef was almost as large in quantity, 
and of much superior quality and flavour to thaft obtained 
from any of the other materials ; — the flavour of the product 
from Mutton, Veal, Ac. is comparatively insipid. 

As it is difficult to obtain this rea4y-niade of good quality 
—and we could not find any proper and circumstantial di- 
rections for making it, which, on trial, answered |he pur- 
pose, — and it is really a great acquisition to the Army and 
I»}avy — ^to Travellers, Invalids, &c.— ^the Editor, has bestow- 
ed some time, &c. in endeavouring to learn— and to teach 
how<^ it may be prepared in the easiest, most economical,

Those who do not regard the expense, and like the flavour, 
may add the lean of Ham, in the proportion of a pound to 
eight pounds of Leg of Beef. 

It may also he flavoured, hy adding to it, at the time yoa 
put the Broth into the smaller Stewpan, Mushroom Catsup, 
Eshallot Wine, Essences of Spice or Herhs, &c. ; — we pre- 
fer it quite plain— it is then ready to he converted, in an in- 
stant, into a hasin of Beef Tea for an Invalid, and any flavour 
may be immediately communicated to it by the Magazine of 
Taste (No. 463), 

To Clarify Broth or Gravy.— (No. 252.*) 

Put on the Broth in a clean Stewpan, break the white and 
Shell of an Egaj, beat them together, put them into the 
Broth, stir it with a whisk ; when it has boiled a few mi- 
,nutes, strain it through a Tammis or a napkin. 

Obs, — A careful Cook will seldom have occasion to clarify 
her Broths, &c. if prepared according to the directions given 
in (No. 20.0.) 



THE 

COOK'S ORACLE. 

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 

Melted Butter 

is so simple and easy to prepare, it is a matter of general 
sarprise, that what is done so often in every English kitchen, 
is so seldom done right, — ^Foreigners may well say,. tha|^ 
although we have only One Sauce for vegetables. Fish, 
Flesh, Fowl, &c. — ^we hardly ever make that good. 

It is spoiled nine times out of ien^ more from Idleness^ 
than from Ignorance, and rather because the Cook won't 
than because she can^'t do it,— which can only be the cas« 
when Housekeepers will not allow Butter to do it with. . 

Good melted Butter cannot be made with mere flour 
and water; there must be a fuUand proper proportion of 
BtUter.-^As it must be always on the Table, and is 

The foundation of almost all our English 
SAUCES; we have 

Melted Butter and Oysters, , 

Parsley, 

— ^— — ^ Anchovies, 

• Eggs» 

—————— Shrimps, 

— ; Lobsters, 

Capers, &c. &c. &c. 

I have tried every way of making it ; and I trust, at last, 
that I have written a receipt, which if the Cook will care- 
fully observe, she will constantly succeed in giving satisfiaction. 
In the qua,ntities of the various Sauces I have ordered, I 
have had in view the providing for a Family of half a dozen 
moderate people.

GRAVIl^S AND SAUCES. 



Never pour Sauce over Meat, or even put it into the dish ; 
—however well made, some of the Company may have an 
antipathy to it ; — Tastes are as different as Faces ; — more- 
over, if it is sent up separate in a boat, it will keep hot 
longer, and what is left may be put by for another time, or 
used for another purpose, '' 

Lastly, — Observe, that in ordering the proportions of 
Meat, Butter, Wine, Spice, &c. in the following re- 
ceipts, the proper quantity is set down, and that a less quan^ 
tity will Twt do; — and in some instances, those Palates which 
have beien used to the extreme of Piquance, will require 
additional excitement. ♦ — If we have erred, it has been on 
the right side, from an anxious wish to combine Economy 
with Elegance, and the Wholesome with the Toothsome. 
The following we recommend as an elegant Relish to finish 
Soups and Sauces.

Melted Butter. . 

Keep a pint stewpan * for this purpose only. 

Cut two ounces of butter into little bits, that it may melt 
more easily, and mix more readily; — put it into the stew-- 
pan with a large tea-spoonful (t. e. about three drachms) of 
Flour, (some prefer Arrow Root or Potatoe Starch (No. 
448), ^d two table-spoonsful of Milk. 

When thoroughly mixed,— add six table-spoonsful of water ; 
bold it over the fire, and shake it round every minute, (all 
the while the same way), till it just begins to simmer, then 
let it stand quietly and boil up, It should be of the thickness 
of good cream. 

N»B. Two table-spoonsful of (No. 439) instead of the 
milk, will make as good MushrooiaSauce as need be, and 
is a Superlative accompaniment to either Fish, — Flesh, — or 
Fowl. 

06*. — This is the best way of preparing melted butter ; — 
Milk mixes with the butter much more easily and more inti- 
mately than water alone can be made to do. This is of 

>per thickness to be mixed at table with Flavouring 
ices. Anchovy, Mushroom, or Cavice, &c. If made 
merely to pour .over vegetables, add a little more milk to it. 

'% B» If the Butter Oils, pift a spoonful of cold water 
to it, and stir it with a spoon, — if it is very much oiled, it 
must be poured backwards and forwards from the Stewpan 
to the Sauceboat till it is right s^in.

272 CRAVIES AND gAtTC^. 

Mem. Melted Butter made to be mixed with ffavonring 
Essences, Catsups, &c. should be of 4lie thioknee of light 
Batter, that it may adhere to the Fish, &c. 

Thicketiing, — (No. 257.) 

Clarified butter is best for this purpose ; but if yoii have 
none ready, put some Fresh Butter into a stewpan over a 
slow clear fire ; — when it is melted, add fine Flour sufficient 
to make it the thickness of paste ; — stir it well together with 
a wooden spoon for fifteen or twenty minutes, till it is quite 
smooth, and the colour of a Guinea : this ouist be done very 
gradually and patiently, if you put it over too fierce a fire, to 
hurry it, it will become bitter and empyreumatic ; poor it 
into an earthen pan, and keep it for use. It will keep good 
a fortnight in Summer, and longer in Winter. 

A large spoonful will generally be enough to thickea a 
Quart of Gravy. 

Obs, — This, in the French kitchen, is called Rowc. Be 
particularly attentive in making of it ; if it gets any >iinit 
smell or taste, it will spoil every thing it is put into, see Obt. 
to (No, 322). When cold, it should be thick enough to est 
out with a knife, like a solid paste. 

It is a very essential article in the kitchen, and is the 
basis of consistency in most made dishes, soup£^ sauces, and 
ragouts : — ^if the Gravies, &c. are too (hin, add this Thick- 
ening, more or less, according to the consistence you would 
wish them to have. 

Mem. In making Thickening, — the less Butter, and the 
more Flour jrou use the better ; — ^they must be thorough)^ 
worked together, and the brotb, or soup, &c. you put them 
to, added by degrees ; — take especial care to incorporate them 
well together, or your sauces, &c. will taste floury, and have 
a disgusting, greasy appearance ; — ^therefore after you have 
thickened your sauce, add to it some broth, or warm water, 
in the proportion of two table-spoonsful to a pint, and set it 
by the side of the fire,'to raise any fat, &c. that is not thoroi^y 
incorporated with the gravy, which you must carefully remove 
as it comes to the top. This is called cleansing, or finisbii^ 
the sauce. 



ailAVIfiS AND SAUCES. 373- 

^ *i^* Half an ounce of Butter^ and a table-spoonffii of 
FtouVf are about the proportion for a pint of Sauce, to fnak0 
ii tx9 thick as Cream. 

TJ. B. The jFa« Skimmings off the top of the Broth Pot, 
are sometimes substituted for Butter, see (No. 240),— spme 
Cooks merely thicken th^ir Soups and Sauces with Flour y9s 
we have directed in (No. 245), or Potatoe Farina {No. 448). 

Clarified Butter.^(No. 259.) 

Put the Butter in a nice clean stewpan, over a very clear 
sjow fire, watch it, and when it is melted carefully, skim off the 
buttermilk, &c. which will swim on the top ;•— let il stand a 
minute or two, for the impurities to sink to the bottom,-— 
then pour the clear butter through a sieve, into a clean 
basin, leaving the sediment at the bottom of the stewpan. 

Obs» — ^Butter thus purified, will be as sweet as Marrow, — 
a very useful covering for Potted Meats, &c. and for frying 
Fish, equal to the finest Florence oil, for which purpose it is 
commonly used by Catholics, and those whose religious te- 
nets will not allow them to eat viands fried in animal oil. 

Burnt Btrficr.— (No. 260.) 

Put two ounces of fresh butter into a small fryingpan, 
when it becomes a dark brown colour, add to it a table- 
spodnfiil and a half of good vinegar, and a little pepper and 
salt. 

06^.— TMs is used as sauce for boiled Fish, or poached 
Eggs. 

Otferf Bwttcr.— (No. 260*.) 

Put two ounces of fresh Biitter into a saucepan, set it at a 
(fistance from the fire so that it may melt gradually, till it 
comes to an Oil,-^and pour it off quietly from the dregs. 

Obs. — ^This will supply the place of Olive Oil, and by 
aOme» is preferred to it, either for Salads, or Frying. 

Parsley and JButfcr.— (No. 261.) 

• Wash some Parsley very clean, and pick it carefiilfy, leaf 
bjrleaf ; put a tea^poonful of salt into tsM a pint of Jboilioig.

ivater» boil the Parsley about ten minuttSy drain it od a 
vieve, mince it quite fine, and then bruise it to a pulp. 

The delicacy and excellence of this elegant and innocent 
Relish, depends upon the Parsley being mincad very fine ; 
put it into a sauce-boat, and mix with it, by degrees, about 
half a pint of good melted butter (No. 256), only do not 
put so much flour to it, as the Parsley will add to its thick- 
ness, — ^never pour Parsley and Butter over boiled things, but 
send it up in a Boat. 

Obs. — In French Cookery Books, this is called ** JMeUed 
JEtutteTy English Fashwiiy'* and, with the addition of a slice 
of lemour cut into dice, a little Allspice and Vinegar, ** Z>u(c& 
Sauce:' 

N. B. To PRESERVE Parsley through the winter, — ^in 
May, June, or July, take fine fresh gathered sprigs, pick and 
wash them clean, set on a stewpan half full of water, put a 
little salt in it,, boil and skim it clean, and then put in the 
Parsley and let it boil for a couple of minutes, and take it 
out, and lay it on a sieve before the fire, that it n^ay be dried 
as quick as possible, — ^put it by in a Tin Box, and keep it in 
a dry place, — when you want it, lay it in a Basin, and cover 
it with warm water a few minutes before you use it. 

Crooseherry Sauce, — (No, 263.) 

Top and tail them close, with a pair of scissors, ^and scakl 
half a pint of ^reen Gooseberries, drain them on a hair sieve,

French, minced Fennel,-:-others send up the Gooseberries 
whole or mashed, without any Butter, &c. 

Chervil, — ^Basil, — Tarragon, — Burnet, — Cress,— 

and Butter. — (No. 264.) 

This is the first time that Chervil, which has so long been 
a favourite with the sagacious French Cook, has been intro- 
duced into an English book. — Its flavour is a strong concen- 
tration of the combined taste of Parsley and Fennel,, hMtm<)re

in {No. 261.) 

Obs. — For Mackarel sauce, or. boiled Soles, &c. — some 
people take equal parts of Fennel and Parsley t — others adct 
. a «prig of Mint, or a couple of young Onions minced very 
fine. 

Mackarel Roe 5a«ce.— (No. 266.) 

Boil the Roes of Mackarel, (soft roes are best,) bruise 
them with a spoon with the yolk of an Egg, beat up with a 
very little pepper and salt, and some Fennel and Parsley 
boiled and chopped very fine, mixed with almost half a pint 
of thin melted butter, see (No. 256.) 

'Mushroom catsup, Walnut pickle, or Soy, maybe added. . 

£ggSauce.-^(So.267.) 

This agreeable accompaniment to roasted Poultry^ or 
salted Fishy — is made by putting three Eggs into boiling 
water, and boiling them for about twelve minutes, when 
they will be hard, put them into cold water till you want 
them.-»— This will make the Yolks firmer, and prevent their 
surface turning blacky and you can cut them much neater, — use 
only two of the Whitest cut the Whites into small dice, — 
the Yolks, into bits about a quarter of an inch square, — ^put 
' them into a Sauceboat, pour to them half a pint of melted 
.Butter, and stir thejc t<^ether. 

dbs, — ^The Melted Butter for Egg Sauce need not be made 
quite so thick as (No. 256^) If you are for Superlative Egg 
SiMce, pound the Yolks of a Couple of Eggs, and rub them 
with the melted butter to thicken it. 

N. B. Some Cooks garnish Salt Fish with hard boiled 
e^ cat in half.

Anchxmf *Saucc.— (No. 270.) 

Pound three Anchovies in a mortar with a little bit of 
Butter, rub it through a double Hair sieve, with the beck of 
a wooden spoon, and stir it into almost half a pint of Melted 
butter (No. 256) ; or stir in a table-spoonful of Essence of 
Anchovy (No. 433.) — To the above, many cooks add Leknon- 
juice and Cayenne. 

Ofi^.^Foreigners make this sauce with good Brown SSauoe 
(No. 329), or White Sauce (No. 364), instead of melted 
Butter, — ^add to it Catsup, — Soy,^and some of their fla- 
voured Vinegars, as Elder or Tarragon. — ^Pepper and fine 
Spice, — sweet herbs, — Capers, — Eshallots, — &c. They 
serve it with most Roasted Meats. 

N. B. Keep your Anchovies well covered, first tie down 
your Jar with Bladder moistened with vinegar, and then 
wiped dry, tie Leather over that: when you open a Jar, 
moisten the bladder, and it will come off easily, — ^as soon as 
■you have taken out the Fish, replace the coverings, the air 
soon rusts and spoils Anchovies. See (No. 433, &c.) 

Garlick i&Mcc.— (No. 272.)

. 0&^.— Some boil, and mince fine a few leaves of Parsley, 
or Chersil, or Tarragon, and add these to the saoce;— • 
ethers the juice of half a Seville Orange, or Lemon. 

Mem, — ^Keep the Caper bottle very closely corked, and do 
not ttee any of the Caper liquor : — ^if the Capers are not well 
covered with it, they will immediately spoil, and it is an e%^ 
cellent ingredient in Hashes, &c. The Dutch use it as a Fish 
Saoce, mixing it with melted b;utter. 

Jfoc^ Caper Sauce.— (No. 275 or 295.) 

Cut some pickled Green Pease,-^French Beans, — Gher- 
kins, — or Nasturtiums, into bits the size of Capers ; put 
them into half a pint of melted butter, with two tea-spoonfttul. 
of Lemon juice, or nice Vinegar. 

Oyster Sawcc.— (No. 278.) 

Choose Plump and Juicy Natives for this purpose ;— 
DmH take them out of their Shell till you put them into the 
Steujpan, see 06*. to (No. 181.) 

To make good Oyster Sauce for half a dozen hearty Fish^ 
EaterSi you cannot have less than three or four dozen Oysters* 
o^^Sare their liquor, strain it, and put it and them into a stew- 
pan; as soon as they boil, and the fish plump, tsdae them off 
the Fire, and pour the* contents of the stewpan^into a sieve

become hard." 

If you have not Liquor enough, add a little Melted Butter, 
or Cream, see (No. 388,) or Milk beat up with the yolk of 
an Egor^ (this must not be put in till the sauce is done.) Some 
barbarous Cooks add Pepper, — or Mace, — the juice or peel 
of a Lemon, — Horseradish,-^£ssence of Anchovy, — Cayenne^ 
&c. ; — Plain Saucts are only to taste of the Ingredient from 
which they derive their name, 

Obs, — It will very much heighten the flayour of this Sauce, 
to pound the soft part of half a dozen (unboiled) Oysters, 
rub it through a hair sieve, and then stir it into the sauce: 
— ^this Essence of OystebI (and for some palates a few 
grains of Cayenne) is the only addition we recommend. See 
(No. 441.) 

Preserved Oysters.^i^o. 2S0.) 

Open the Oysters carefully, so as not to cut them except 
in dividing the gristle which attaches the shells, — ^put them 
into a Mortar, and when you have got as many as you can 
conveniently pound at once, add about two drachms of Salt 
to a dozen Oysters, — ^pound them and rub them through the 
back of a hair sieve, and put them into a mortar s^ain, with 
as much Flour (which has been previously thorbtighly dried) 
as will make them into a paste, roll it out several tioies, and 
lastly, flour it and roll it out the thickness of a half crown, 
and divide it into pieces about an inch square, lay them i&a 
Dutch oven, where they will dry so gently as not to get burned, 
r-tum them every half hour, and when they b^in to dry, 
crumble them, — ^they will take about four hours to dry,— - 
then pound them fine,— -sift them and put them into bottki, 
and seal them over. 

N.B. Three dozen of Natives required 71 omieesof 
dried Flour to make them into a paste, which then weighed 
11 ounces, — when dried andpowaeredj 61 ounces. 
. To make half a pint of Sauce, put one ounce of Butter into 
a stewpan, with tnree drachms of Oyster powder, and sii 
iable-spoonsful of milk ; set it on a slow fire, stir ittill it bofls, 
and season it with salt \ . 



QRAVISS AND SAUCES. 279 

This Powder, if made with Plump Juicy Natives, will 
abound with the flavour of the Fish, and if closely corked, 
and kept in a dry place, will remain good for some time* 

Obs, — This Extract, is a welcome succedaneum while 
Oysters are out of season, and in such inland parts as ^Idom 
have any, is a valuable addition to the list of Fish sauces : it 
is equally good with boiled Fowl, or Rump Steak, — and- 
sprinkled on Bread and Butter makes a very good Sandwich, 
and is especially worthy the notice of Countiy Housekeepers- 
— and as a Store Sauce for the Army and Navy.^ See An^ 
chovy Powder (No. 435.) 

Shrimp iSfaitwJc.— (No. 283.) 

Shell a Pint of Shrimps, pick them clean, wash them and 
put them into half a pint of good Melted Butter. A Pint of 
unshelled Shrimps is about enough for Four Persons. <. 

Obs. — Some stew the Heads and shells of the Shrimps, 
(with or. without a blade of bruised Mace,) for a quarter of an 
hour, and strain off the liquor to melt the butter with, and 
add a little Lemon juice, — Cayenne, — and Essence of An-. 
Qhovy,— or Soy, — fcavice, &c. ; — but the Flavour of the 
Shrimp is so delicate^ it will be overcome by any of such, 
additions. 

Mem. — If your Shrimps are not quite fresh they will eat 
tough and thready as other St{de Fish do.*— See Obs* to (No. 
140.) 

Lobster Sauce. — (No. 284.) 

Choose a fine spawny Hen Lobster,* be sure it is fresh, 
so get a live one ii you can, (one of my culinary predecessors 
says, " let it be heavy and lively j^*) and boil it as (No. 176,) 
pick out the Spawn and the Red Coral into a mortar, addito

* You. must have a Heo Lobster> on account of the Live Sfptiven'.-r-

it half an dance of Butter, pound it quite smootli, and rub it 
tbroi^h a hair sieve with the back, of a wooden spoon ; att 
the meat of the Lobster into smaU squares, or pull it to pieots 
with a fork, put the pounded Spawn into as much melted 
Butter J(No. 256) as you think will do, and stir it together tUl 
it is thoroughly mixed, — ^now put to it the tneat of the Lob* 
8ter, and warm it on the fire, take care it does not boil, which 
idiU spoil its complexiony and its briliiant Red colour wiU m- 
mediately fade* 

' The above is a very easy and excellent manner of makii^ 
this Sauce. 

Some use strong Beef or Veal Gravy instead of melted 
Butter, adding Anchovy, Cayenne, Catsup, Cavice, Lemon 
juice, or pickle, or Wine, &c. 

Obs,-—Save a little of the inside Red Cored Spawns and rub 
it through a sieve (without butter :) — it is a very ornamental 
garnish to sprinkle over Fish ; and if the skin is broken, 
(which win sometimes happen to the most careful Cook, 
when there is a large dinner to dress, and many other thii^ 
to attend to,) you will find it a convenient and elegant VeU, 
to conceal your misfortune from the prying eyes of piscivor- 
ous Gourmands, 

N. B. Various methods have been tried to freserts Lob- 
sters, see (No. 178,) and Lobster Spawn, for a Store Sanee. 
The. Live Spawn may be kept some time in strong Salt and- 
Water — or in an Ice-house. 

The following process might, perhaps, preserve it longer : 
— rPut it into a Saucepan of boiling water, with a large spoon- 
ful of Salt in it, and let it boil quick for five minutes ; then 
drain it on a hair sieve, spread it out thin on a plate, and set 
it in a Dutch Oven till it is thoroughly dried, — grind it in a 
dean mill, and pack it Closely in well'Stopped Bottles. See 
alsd Potted Lobsters^ (No. 178.) 

Sauce for Lobster, ^c— (No. 285.)— See also (Nos. 372.) 

Bruise the yolks of two bard boiled £^ with the bac^ of

Anchovy Essence (No. 433,) is occasionally added, 

Liv^ and Parslfy Sauce,— (No. 287.)— or Liver and 

Lemon Sauce. 

Wash the Liver (it must be perfectly fresh) of a Fowl or 
Habbit, and boil it five minutes in five table-spoonsful of 
water ;— chop it fine ; or pound or bruise it in a small quan- 
tity of the liquor it was boiled in, and rub it through a sieve: 
'^-wash about one-third the bulk of Parsley leaves, put them 
on to boil in a little boiling water, with a tea- spoonful pf salt 
in it; lay it on a hair si^ve to drain, and mince it very fine; 
mix it with the liver, and put it intq a quarter pint pf meltei 
butter, and warm it up ;— ^do not let it boil. 

Or, 

To make Lemon and Liver Sauce. 

Pare ofi* the rind of a Lemon, or of a Seville Orange, as 
thin as possible, so as not to cut off any of the White with 
it ; — ^now cut off aU the White, and cut the Lemon into slices, 
about as thick as a couple of half-crowns ; pick out the pips* 
and divide the slices into small squares : add these, and a 
little of the peel minced very fine to the Liver, prepared as 
directed above, and put them into the melted Butter, ^d 
.warm them together, — ^but do not let them boil. 

N. B. The Poulterers can always let you have yrc*A Livefs 
— if that of the Fowl or Rabbit is not good, or not large 
enough to make as much Sauce as you wish. 

Ohs. — Some Cooks, instead of pounding,-— mince the Liver 
very fine (with half as much Bacon,)'and leave out the Pars- 
ley,— others add the juibe of half a Lemon, and some of the 
Peel grated,— or a tea-spoonful of Tarragon or Chili Vine- 
gar, a table-spoonful of White Wine, or a little beaten Mace 
or Nutmeg, or Allspice : — if you wish it a little more lively 
on the palate, pound a Shallot, or a few leaves of Tarragon 
or Basil, with Anchovy or Catsup, or Cayenne.

N. B. To the above the French Cook adds an Onion or 
Esh^lot, a Clove or two, or a little Tarragon Vinegar. 

Mock Tcmata Saitcc.— (No. 293.) 

The only difference between this, and genuine Love-apple 
Sauce, is the substituting the pulp of Apple for that of To- 
mata, colouring it with Turmeric, and communicating an aeid 
Savour to it by vinegar. 

ShaUot Sauce— (No. 294.) 

Take four Shallots, and make it in the same manner as Gar-«

Claret, or Port wine, and same of Mushroom Catsup, — (yov 
may sharpen it with a little Lemon Juice or Vinegar) — and 
rub it through a tammy or fine sieve. 

Curry Powder (No. 348), will convert this into ex- 
€eUent Curry Sauce. 

N.B. If this Sauce is for Steaks, shred an ounce olT 
Onions, fry them a nice brown, and put them to the sauce 
you have rubbed througl^ a tammy ;— or some very small 
round young silver Button Onions, see (No. 296), peeled 
and boiled tender, and put in whole when your sauce if 
done, will be an acceptable addition* 

Obs, — If you have no Broth, put in half a pint of water,

28S GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 



Sage and Oniony or Groose'-siuffing fifcwtcc.— (No. 300.) 

Chop very fine an ounce of Onion and half an ounce of 
green Sage leaves, put them into a stewpan with ibur 
spoonsful of water, simmer gently for ten minutes, then pat 
in a tea-spoonful of pepper and salt, and one ounce of fine 
hread crumbs ; mix well together ; — ^then pour to it a quar- 
ter of a pint of (Broth, or Gravy, or) Melted Butter, stir well 
together, and simmer it a few minutes longer, 

Obs* — ^This is a very relishing Sauce for Roast Port, 
Poultry, Geese, or Ducks ; or Green Pease on Maigre Days» 

See also Bonne Bouche for the above (No, 341.) 

Green Mint Sauce.— (No. 303.) 

Wash half a handful of nice young fresh-gathered Green 
Mint, (to this some add one-third the quantity of Parsley,) 
pick the leaves from the stalks, mince them very fine, and 
put them into a sauce-b(5ar, with a tea-spoonful of Booist 
Sugar, and four table-spoonsful of Vinegar. 

Obs. — This is the usual accompaniment to Hot Lamb ; — 
and an equally agreeable relish with Cold Lamb. 

If Green Mint cannot be procured, this sauce may be 
made with Mint Vinegar (No. 398.) 

^pple *SaMce.— (No. 304.) 

Pare and core three good sized baking Apples, put tbem 
into a well-tinned pint saucepan, with two table- spoonsful 
of cold water ; cover the saucepan close, and set it on a trivet 
over a slow fire a couple oi hours before dinner, — some 
Apples will take a long time stewing, — others will be ready 
in a quarter of an hour: — when the Apples are done 
enough, pour off the water, let them stand a few minutes to 
get dry ; ihien beat them up with a Fork, with a bit of 
Butter about as big as a Nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of 
powdered Sugar. 

N.B. Some add Lemcn Peel, grated, or minced fine,— or 
boil a bit with the Apples. Some are fond of Apple Sauce 
with cold Pork — ask those you serve if they desire it.

Mushroom Sauce, — (No. 305.) 

Pick and peel half a pint of Mushrooms (the smaller the 
befter], wash them very cJean, and put them into a sauce- 
pan vith half a pint of Veal Gravy or Milk, a little Pepper 
and Salt, and an ounce of Butter ruhbed with a table-spoon- 
ftil of Flour, stir them together, and set them over a gentle 
fire,, to stew slowly till tender ; — skim and strain it. 

Obs. — ^It will be a great improvement to this, and the two 
following Sauces, to add to them the juice of half a dcaen 
Mushrooms, prepared the day before, by sprinkling them 
with salt, the same as when you make C atsup ; or ad<f a 
lai^ spoonful of good Double Mushroom Catsup, (No^439.) 

See QuiNTESoENte of Mushrooms (No. 440.) 

N. B. Much as we love the flavour of Mushrooms, — ^we 
must enter our protest against their being eaten in sub- 
stance, — ^when the morbid effects they produce too often 
prove them worthy of the appellations Seneca gave them, 
*' Voluptuous Poison," ** lethal luxury,*' &c. ; and we cau- 
tion those who cannot refrain from indulging their palate 
with the seducii^ relish of this deceitful Fungus, to masti- 
cate it diligently. 

We do not believe that Mushrooms are nutritive,— every 
one knows they are often dangerously indigestible, — ^there- 
fore the Rational Epicure will be content with extracting the 
flavour from them — which is obtained in the utmost perfec- 
tion by the process directed in. (No. 439). 

Mushroom Sauce^ .Bfown.— (No. 306.)

Poor Man's Sauce.— (No. 310.) 

Pick a handful of Parsley leaves from the stalks, mince 
them very fine, strew over a little salt ; shred fine half a

and five of Vinegar ; add some ground Black Pepper and 
Salt ; stir together and send it up. 

Pickled French Beans or Gherkins, cut fine, maybe

(No. 272.) 

Slice a pound and a half of Veal, or Beef, pepper and 
salt it, lay it in a stewpan with a couple of Carrots split, and 
four cloves of Garlick sliced, a quarter pound of sliced tiam, 
and a large spoonful of water ; set the stewpan over a gende 
fire, and watch when the meat begins to stick to the pan ; 
when it does, turn it, and let it be very well browned, (but 
take care it is not at- all burnt ;) then dredge it with floor, 
and pour in a quart of broth, a bunch of sweet Herbds a 
couple of Cloves bruised, and slice in -a Lemon; set it on 
again, and let it simmer gently for an hour and a half 
longer ; then take off jthe fat, and strain the gravy irom the 
ingredients, by pouring it through a napkin, straining, and 
pressing it very hard.

Garlick Vinegar, a table-spoonful, — of Mustard, Brown 
Sugar, and Black Pepper, a tea-spoonful each, stirred into 
half a pint of oiled melted butter. 

Mr. Kelly*s Sauce Piquante. 

Pound a table-spoonful of Capers, — and one of minced 
Parsley, — as fine as possible ; then add the yolks of three 
hard Ews, rub them well together with a table-spoonful of 
Mustard. — ^bone six Anchovies, and pound them, rub them 
through a hair sieve, and mix with two table-spoonsful of 
Oil, one of Vinegar, one of Shallot ditto, and a few grains 
of Cayenne Pepper ; rub all these well together in a mortar, 
till thoroughly mcorporated, then stir them into half a pint 
of good Gravy, or melted Butter, and put the whole through 
a sieve. 

Fried Parsley.— -(^o, 317.) 

Let it be nicely picked and washed, then put into a cloth, 
and swung backwards and forwards till it is perfectly dry^ — ; 
put it into a pan of hot fat, fry it quick, and have a slice 
ready to take it out the moment it is crisp, (in another mo- 
ment it will be spoilt) ; put it on a sieve, or coarse cloth, 
before the fire to drain. 

Crisp Par5%.— (No. 318 ) 

Pick and wash young Parsley, shake it in a dry cloth to 
drain the water from it ; spread it on a sheet of clean paper, 
in a Dutch oven before the fire, and turn it frequently until 
it is quite crisp. — This is a much more easy way of prepar- 
ing it than Frying it, which is not seldom ill done. 

Obs, — A very pretty garnish for Lamb Chops, Fish, &c.

•—shape these into Triangles or Crosses : — put some very 
dean Fat into ftu iron Fryingpan ; when it is hot, put in tbe 
sippets, and fry them a delicate light hrovon ; take them up 
with a Fish slice, and drain them well from Fat, turning them 
occasionally : — ^this will take a quarter of an hour. Keep the 
paii at such a distance from the fire, that the &t may he hot 
enough to brown without burning the bread ;*— this is a re- 
quisite precaution in frying delicate thin things. 

O65.— These we a pretty garnish^ and very welcome ac- 
companiment and improvement to the finest made Dishes: 
—they may also be sent up with Pea^ and other Soups-; — 
but' when intended for Soups, the Bread must be cut into 
bits, about half an inch square. 

N. B. i/* these are not done very delicately dean and dry ^

Fried Bread Crumbs. — {No. 320.) 

Itub Bread (which has been baked two days) through a

till they are as fine as if they had been grated, and sifted; 
put them into a stewpan with a couple of ounces of Batter,

oat the Onion and Pepper, and it is ready. 

Obs. — ^This is an excellent accompaniment to Game antt

Rice Sauce.— {So. 321».) 

Steep a quarter of a pound of Rice in a pint of milk, with 
Onion, Pepper, &c. as in the last receipt ; when the rice is 
quite tender (take out the spice), rub it through a sieve mt6 
a clean stewpan : if too thidc, put a little milk or cream to

Obs. — ^This is a very delicate White sauce ; — ^and at ek- 
gant tables, is frequently served instead of Bread Sauce. 

Browning— (No. 322.) 

* Is a coiivenient article to colour those Soups or Setucei^ of 
which it is supposed their deep brown complexion denotes 
^e strength and savouriness of the composition. 

Burnt Sugar is also a favourite ingredient with the Brew- 
ers, who use it under the name of ** Essentia Bina " to co- 
lour their Beer; — it is also employed by the Brandy-makers, 
inconsiderable quantity, to colour Brandy ; to which, be- 
sides enriching its complexion, it gives that sii^eetkh taste, 
and fulness in the mouthy which custom has taught Brandy 
drinkers to admire, and prefer to the finest Cognac in its 
genuine state. 

When employed for Culinaxy Purposes, this is sometimes

Dutch,) Sardinias, — or Sprats,— appear to be the bases of 
almost all the Sauces which now, to use the maker's phrase, 
— ^tand unrivalled. 

Although indefatigable research and experiment has put 
us in possession of these compositions, — it would not be quite 
fair, to enrich the Cook, at the expense of the Oilman, &c. 
— we hope we have said enough on these subjects, to satisfy 
** the Rational Epicure." 

, Put half a pound of pounded Lump Sugar, and a table- 
spoonful of water, into a clean iron saucepan, set it over a 
slow fire, and keep stirring it with a wooden spoon till it 
becomes a bright brown colour, and begins to smoke ; then 
add to it an ounce of salt, and dilute it by degrees with 
water, till it is the thickness of Soy ; let it boil, take off the 
scum, aud strain the liquor into bottles, which most be well 
stopped : if you have not any of this by you, and you wish 
to darken the colour of your sauces, pound a tea-spoonful of 
lump sugar, and put into an iron spoon, with as much water 
as will dissolve it; hold it over a quick fire till it becomes 
of a very dark brown colour ; mix it with the soup, &c. 
while it is hot. 

065.-'-Mo5it of the preparations under this title are a med- 
ley of Burnt Butter, — Spices, — Catsup, — ^Wine, &c. We 
recommend the Rational Epicure to be content with the na- 
turcU Colour of Soups and Saucesy which, to a well-edu- 
cated Palate, are much more agreeable, without any of these

the most distressing indigestions.

Gravy for Roast .¥c(rf.— (No. 326.) 

Host joints will afford sufficient trimmings, &c. to make 
half a pint of plain pravy, which ,you may colour with a 
. few drops of (No. 322) ; — for thosfe that do not, about half 
^ hour before you think the meat will be done, mix a salt- 
spoonful of Salt, with a full quarter pint of boiling Water; 
drop this by degrees on the brown parts of the joint ; set a 
dish under to catch it, (the meat will soon brown again) ; 
set it by, — ^as it cools, the Fat will float on the surface ; 
when the meat is ready carefully remove the Fat, and warm 
up the Gfavy, and pour it into the Dish. 

The Common Method is, when the meat is in the dish 
you intend to send it up in, to mix half a tea-spoonful of 
^t in a quarter pint of boiling water, and to drop some of 
this over the comers and underside of the meat, and to pour 
the rest through the hole the spit came out of, — and some 
pierce the inferior parts of the joint with a sharp skewer.

want Gravy for Roast Meat, put two table-spoonsful into 
half a pint of boiling water with a little salt ; — if for Roasted

melted Butter. 

N. B. The Gravy which comes down in the dish, the 
Cook (if she is a good housewife) will preserve to enrich 
Hashes or little Made Dishes, &c. 

Obs. — Some Culinary professors, who think nothing can 
be excellent, that is not extravagant,— call this '< Scots 
Gravy ;" not, I believe, intending it, as it certainly is, a 
compliment to the laudable, and rational frugality of that 
intelligent and sober-minded People. 

N. B. This gravy should be brought to table in a Sauce* 
boat ; preserve the intrinsic Gravy which flows from the 
meat, in the Argyll.

Furnish a thick and well-tinned Stewp^n, with a thin slice 
of fat Ham or Bacon, or an ounce of Butter, and a middling 
sized Onion ; — on this, lay a pound of nice juicy Gravy Beet, 
(as the object in making Gravy is to extract the nutritious 
succuleiice of the Meat, it must be beaten to comminute 
the containing vessels, and scored to augment the surface to 
the action of the water,) cover the Stewpan, set it on a slow 
fire ; when the meat begins to brown, turn it about, and let 
it get slightly browned, (but take care it is not at all burnt:) 
then pour in a pint and a half of boiling water, set the pan 
on the fire; — when it boils,— carefully catch the scum^— - 
and then put in a crust of Bread toasted brown, (don'^t buim 
it) — a spng of Winter Savory, or Lemon Thyme and Pars- 
ley — a roll of thin cut Lemon Peel, a dozen berries of All- 
spice, and a dozen of Black Pepper ; cover the stewpan close, 
let it stew very gently for about two hours, tlien strain it 
through a sieve into a basin. 

If you wish to thicken it, set a clean stewpan over a slow 
fire, with about an ounce of Butter in it ; when it is melted, 
dredge to it (by degrees) as much flour as will dry it up, 
stirring them well together ; when thoroughly mixed, pour 
in a litde of the Gravy, — stir it well together, and add the 
remainder by degrees ; set it over the fire, let it simmer gently 
for fifteen or twenty minutes longer, and skim off the fat, &c. 
as it rises ; when it is about as thick as cream, squeeze it 
through a tammis, or fine sieve,-^^ind you will have a fine 
rich Brown Sauce, at a very moderate Expense, and without 
much trouble. 

Qbs. — If you wish to make it still more Relisking^ — if it is 
for Poultry^ you may pound the Liver with a bit of Butter,

Obs. — This is an excellent Sauce for all kinds of Wild water 
fowl. 

The common way of gashins: the breast, and squeezing in 
an Orange, cools and hardens the flesh, and compels every 
one to eat Duck that way ; — some people like Wild fowl very 
little done, and without any Sauce.

Pat an ounce of Butter into a Pint Stewpan ; when it is 
melted, add to it .half an ounce of Onion minced very fine : 
turn it with a wooden spoon, till it takes a light brown colour, 
then stir in a table-spoonful of Flour, a table-spoonful of 
Mushroom Catsup, (with or without the like quantity of Port

or one or two tea-spoonsful of Vinegar, or Basil, (No. 397,) 
or Tarragon (No. 396,) or Bamet Vinegar (No. 399.) 

Obs. — The French call this "Sauce Robert" (from the 
name of the book who invented it,) and are very fond of it 
with many things, which Maht Smith, in the " Compkte 
Housekeeper^^^ 8vo. 1772, p. 105, translates Roe-Boat- 
Sauce. See Obs. to (No. 529.) 

Turtle Sauce.— (No. 343.) 

Put into your Stewpan a pint of Beef Gravy thickened (No. 
329 ;) add to this some of the following Essence of Turtle 
(No. 343,*) or a wine-glassful of Madeira, the juice and peel 
of half a Lemon, a few leaves of Basil,* an Eshallot quartered,

380,) &c. 

Obs, — This is the Sauce for boiled or hashed Calf's head, 
—Stewed Veal, — or any dish you dress Turtle fashion. 

The far-fetcht knd dear-bought Turtle, owes its high rank 
(aa the list of savoury Bonnes Bouches to the relislung and 
piquante sauce that is made fat it ; — ^without, it would be as 
insipid as any other fish is without Sauce. See Obs. to (No. 
493.)

Sweet Sauce for Venison or Hare. — (No. 346.) 

Put some Currant Jelly into a stewpan ; when it is melted, 
pour it into a sauce-boat. 

N.B. Many send it to table without melting. To make 
Currant Jelly, see (No. 479*.) 

This is a more salubrious relish than either Spice or Salt, 
and when the Palate protests against animal f(>od unless its 
flaTOur be masked. — Currant Jelly is a good accompaniment 
to Roasted or Hashed Meats^ 

Mutton Gravy, for Venison or Hare. — (No. 347.) 

The best gravy for Venison is that made with the trim- 
miogs of the Joint : if this is all used, and you have no rxA*

Curry Sauce-^fNo. 348.) 

is made by'stirring a sufficient quantity of Curry stuff, see 
(No. 455,) into gravy or melted butter, or onion sauce, (Nos. 
297, 298,) or onion gravy (No. 299 or 339.) 

The compositions of Curry Powder and the Palates of those 
who eat it vary so much, that we cannot recommend any spe- 
. cific quantity. The Cook must add it by degrees, tsistmg as 
she proceeds, and take care not to put in too much, 

Obs, — The Curry Powder (No. 455^) approxiinates more 
nearly to the best Indian Curry stuff, and is an agreeable and 
well blenj^ed mixture of this class of aromatics. 

N,B. To dress Curries, see (No. 497.) 

Essence of Ham. — (No. 351.)j 

Essence of Ham and of Beef may be purchased at the

three table-spoonsful of flour ; when well mixed, add to it 
three pints of broth or water, pour a little at a time, thait the 
thickening be smooth, stir it until it boil, put the stewpan

be used in a day or two. 

The Ready made Mustard, prqiared at the oil shops,

308 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 

If the Herbs be young, — fresh gathered,— trimmed neatly, 
and drained dry, — and the Sauce-maker ponders patiently 
over the following directions, — ^he cannot fail obtaining the 
fieune of being a very accomplished Salad-dresser. 

Boil a couple of Eggs for twelve minutes, and put them in 
a basin of cold water for a few minutes, — the Yolks mua he 
quite cold and hard^ cer they will not incorporate with the t»- 
gredients. Rub them through a sieve with a wooden spoon, 
and mix them with a table-spoonful of Water, or fine double 
Cream, then add two table-spoonsful of Oil or melted Butter; 
when these are well mixed, add by degrees, a tea-spoonfiil 
of Salt, or powdered lump Sugar, and the same of made 
Mustard ; when these are smoothly united, add very gradually 
three table-spoonsful of Vinegar, rub it with the other ingre- 
dients till thoroughly incorporated with them ; cut up the 
white of the egg, and garnish the top of the salad with it. 
Let the Sauce remain at the bottom of the Bowl, and do not 
stir up the Salad till it is to be eaten ; — ^we recommend the 
esters to be mindful of the duty of mastication, — without the 
due performance of which, all undressed Vegetables aretrour 
blesome company for the principal viscera, and some are efen 
dangerously indigestible. 

Boiled Salad. 

This is best compounded of boiled or baked Onions, (if 
Portugal the belter,) some baked Beet-root, Cauliflower or 
Brocoli, and boiled Celery and French Beans, or any of these 
articles, with the common Salad dressing ; added to this, to 
give it an enticing appearance, and to give some of the crisp- 
ness and freshness so pleasant in salad, a small quantity of 
raw Endive, or Lettuce and Chervil, or Burnet, strewed on 
the top : this is by far more wholesome than the Raw Salad) 
and is much eaten when put on the table. 

N. B. The above Sauce is equally good with cold Meat,— 
cold Fish— or for Cucumbers, — Celery, — Radishes, &c. (awi 
all the other Vegetables that are sent to table undressed) ; to 
the above, a little minced Onion is gei^erally an acceptable 
addition.

FORCEMEAT STUFFINGS.— (No. 373.) 

Forcemeat is now considered an indispensable accompani- 
ment to most Made Dishes, and when composed with good 
taste, gives additional spirit and relish to even that " Sove- 
reign of Savouriness,*' Turtle Soup. 

It is also sent up in Patties, and for stuffing of Veal, Game, 
Poultry, &c. 

The ingrelients should be so proportioned, that no one 
flavour predominates. 

To give the same stuffing for Veal — ^Hare, &c. argues a 
poverty of Invention — with a little contrivance, you may make 
as great a variety as you have Dishes. 

I have given Receipts for some of the most favourite com- 
positions, and a Table of Materials, a glance at which will 
enable the ingenious Cook to make an infinite variety of com- 
binations : the First column containing the spirit, the Second 
the substance of them. 

The poignancy of Forcemeat should be proportioned to the

duce the flavours to which her employers are partiaU See

Most people have an acquired, and peculiar taste in stuff-

what another considers the most agreeable : and after all the 
cotitrivance of a pains-taking palatician, to combine her **haiiis 
foto" in the most hamlonious proportions, 

<< The very dish one likes the best, 
Is acid, or 'insipid, to tiie rest." 

Custom is all in all, in mattersof Taste,—- it is not that one 
pecBon is naturally fond of this or that, and another natuia% 
averse to it, — ^but that one is used to it, and another is nol. 

The consistency of Forcemeats is rather a difficult thing 
to manage ; they are almost always either too light or too 
heavy. 

Take care to pound it till perfectly smooth^ and thai dl 
lAe ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. 

Forcemeat balls must not be larger than a small Nutmegs 
-^f they are for Brown Sauce^ flour them and fry them ;— 
if for JVhiie^ put them into boiling water, and boil them for 
three minutes ; the latter are by fiair the most delicate. 

N. B. If not of sufficient stiffness, it falls to pieces, and 
■nikes Soup, &c. grouty and very unsightly. 

SwBETBREADS and Tongues are the favourite mattriab 
for forcemeat

Stuffing for Veal, Roast Turkey, Fowl, ^c (No. 374.) 

Mince a quarter of a pound of Beef Suet, (Beef Marrow 
is better), the same weight of Bread Crumbs, two drachms 
of Parsley leaves, a drathm and a half of sweet Marjoram 
(or Lemon-thyme), and the same of grated Lemon-peel, aod 
Onion chopped as fine as possible, a little Pepper and Salt: 
—pound thoroughly together with the yolk and white of two 
Eggs, and secure it in the Veal with a skewer, or sew it in 
with a oit oif thread. 

Make some of it into Balls or Sausages, flour them, dnd 
boil, or fry them, and send them up as a garnish, or in a 
side dish, with roast Poultry, Veal, or Cyitlets, &c. 

N. B. This is about the quantity for a Turkey Poult; 
a very large Turkey will take nearly twice as much. To the 
above may be added an ounce of dressed Ham,— or use 
equal parts of the above Stuffing, and Pork Sausage Meat 
(No. 87), pounded well together. 

Obs, — Good Stuffing has always been considered a chef' 
d'oBuvre in Cookery ; it has given immortality to 

" Poor Roger Fowler, who'd a generous miod, 
Nor would submit to have his hand confined. 
But aimed at all, — ^yet never could excil 
In any thing but stuffing of his Veal.'' 

Kuio's Art of Cookery, p. 113. 

Veal Forcemeat. — (No. 375.) 

Of undressed lean Veal, (after you have scraped it quite 
fine, and free from skin and sinews), two ounces, the same 
quantity of (Beef or Veal) Suet, and the same of Bread 
Crumbs, chop fine two drachms of Parsley, one of Lemon- 
peel, one of Sweet Herbs, one of Onion, and half a drachm 
of Mace, or Allspice, (beaten to fine powder); pound all 
together in a mortar, break into it the yolk and white of an 
Eg» ; — rub it all up well together, and season it with a 
little pepper and salt. 

Ohs. — This may be made more savoury, by the addition 
of cold boiled pickled Tongue, Anchovy, Eshallot, Cayenne, 
or Curry powder, &c. 



STUFFINGS. 313 . 

Stuffing for Turkeys or Fowls, 8fc, — (No. 377.) 

Take the foregoing composition for the Roast Turkey, — 
or Stdd the soft part of a dozen Oysters to it, — an Anchovy, 
—or a little grated Ham, or Tongue, if you like it, is still 
more relishing. Fill the craw of the Fowl, &c. but do not 
cram it so as to disfigure its shape. 

. Pork Sausage Meat is sometimes used to stuff Turkeys, 
and Fowls, — or fri^ed, and sent up as a Garnish. 

Goose'or Duck Stuffing. --^(So. 378.) 

Chop very fine about two ounces of Onion,— of green 
Sage leaves about an ounce, (both unboiled), four ounces of 
Bread Crumbs, a bit of butter about as big as a walnut, &c., 
the yolk and white of an Egg, and a little pepper and salt; 
some add to this a minced Apple. 

For another, spe Roasted Goose and Duck (Nos. 59 and 
61), which latter we like as Forcemeat Balls for Mock Turtle; 
then add a little Lemon-peel, and warm it with Cayenne. 

Stuffing for Har€.-'{^o. 379.) 

Two ounces of Beef Suet chopped fine, — ^three ounces of 
fine Bread Crumbs, — Parsley, a drachm. Shallot, half a 
drachm, — a drachm of Marjoram, Lemon-Thyme, or Winter 
Savory, — a drachm of grated Lemon-peel, — and the same of 
Pepper and Salt ; — mix these with the white and yolk of an 
Egg, — do not make it thin, — it must be of cohesive con - 
astence,— if your Stuflfing is not stiff enough, it will be good 
for nothing,-:— put it in the hare, and sew it up. 

*4^* If the Liver is quite sound, you may parboil it, and 
mince it very fine, and add it to the above. 

Forcemeat Balls for Turtle^ Mock Turtle, or Made 
Dishes.— (^o. 380.) See also (No. 375.) 

Pound some Veal in a marble mortar, rub it through a 
sieve with as much of the udder as you have Veal, or about 
a third the quantity of Butter: — put some Bread- Crumbs 
into a stewpan, moisten them with milk, add a little chopped 
Parsley and ShaUot, rub them well tc^ether in a mortar, till

fore your Soup is ready, put them in. 

Egg Ba//«.— (No. 381,) 

Boil four Eggs for ten minutes, and put them into cokl 
water, — when they are quite cold, put the yolks into a 
mortar with the yolk of a raw e^, a tea-spoonful of flour, 
same of chopped parsley, as much salt as will lie o^ a 
shilling, and a little black pepper, or Cayenne, rub them 
well together, roll them into small Balls, (as they swell in 
boiHng), — boil them a couple of minutes.

together in a mortar, and seasoned with Curry powder, see 
(No. 455) ; make and prepare small Balls, as directed in 
(No. 381.) 

Fish Forcemeat.— i^p. 383.) 

Take two ounces of either Turbot, Sole, Lobster, Shrimps, 
or Oysters, free from skin, put it in a mortar, with two 
ounces of fresh Butter, one ounce of Bread crumbs, the yolk 
of two Eggs boiled hard, and a little Eshall(»t, grated Lemon- 
peel, and Parsley, minced very fine; then pound it well till 
it is thoroughly mixed aiid quite smooth ; season it with 
salt and Cayenne to your taste, break in the yolk and white 
of one Egg, rub it well toi^ether, and it is ready for use. 
Oysters parboiled and minced fine, and an Anchovy^ may be 
added.

Orange or Lemon Peel, to mix with Stuffing, — (No. 387.) 

Peel a Seville Orange, or Lemon, very thin, taking off 
only the fine yellow rind, (without any of the whifej) pound 
it in a mortar with a bit of lump sugar, rub it well with the 
peel, — ^by degrees add a little of the forcemeat it is to be 
mixed with ; when it is well ground and blended with this, 
mix it with the wliole : there is no other way of incorpo- 
rating it so well. 

Forcemeats, &c. are frequently spoiled by the insufficient 
mixing of the ingredients. 

Clouted or Clotted Cream.— (No. 388.) 

The milk which is put into the pans one morning stands 
till the next; then set the pan on a hot hearth, (or in a 
Copper Tray, * half full of water, — put this over a stove) ; 
in from ten to twenty minutes, according to the quantity of 
the milk and the size of the pan, it will be enough, — the 
sign of which is, that bladders rise on its surface ; this de- 
notes that it is near boiling, which it must by no means do ; 
and it must be instantly removed from the fire, and placed 
in the dairy till the next morning, when the fine cream is 
thrown up, and is ready for the table, or for Butter, into 
which it is soon converted by stirring it with the hand. 

N. B. This Receipt we have not proved. 

Raspberry Vinegar, — (No. 390.) 

The best way to make this, is to pour three pints of the 
best white wine Vinegar on a pint and a half of fresh- 
gathered Red Raspberries in a stone Jar, or China bowl, 
f neither glazed earthenware^ nor any metallic vessel, must be 
usfid;) the next day strain the liquor over a like quantity of 
fresh Raspberries ; and the day following do the same. Then 
drain off the liquor without pressing, and pass it through a 
Jelly Bag (previously wetted with plain Vinegar) into a stone 
Jar, with a pound of pounded lump Sugar to each* pint. 
When the Sugar is dissolved, stir it up, cover down the Jar, 
and set it in a saucepan of w^ter, and keep it boiling for an 
hour, taking off the scum ; add to each pint a glass of

excellent cooling beverage to assuage thirst in ardoit fevers, 
colds, and inflammatory complaints, &Cm and is agreeable to 
most palates. 

See (No. A79\) 

N. B. We have not proved this receipt. 

Syrup of Lemons, — (No. 391.) 

The best Season for Lemons, is from November to March* 
— Put a pint of fresh Lemon juice to a poimd and three- 
quarters of Lump Sugar; dissolve it by a gentle heat, scum 
it till the surface is quiie clear, — add an ounce of thin cut 
Lemon Peel ; let them simmer fvery gently J together for a 
few minutes, and run it through a flannel. When cold, 
bottle and cork it closely, and keep it in a cool place. 

Or, 

. Dissolve a quarter of an ounce (AvoirdupoUJ of Citric,

(No. 475), flavour it with the Peel, with (No. 408), or dis- 
solve the acid in equal parts of Simple Syrup (No. 475), and 
Syrup of Lemon Peel, made as (No. 393.) 

The Justice's Orange Syrup, for Punch or Puddings, 

(No. 392.) 

Squeeze the Orancres, and strain the juice from the pulp 
into a large pot ; boil it up with a pound and a half of fine 
Sugar to each pint of juice ; skim it well, let it stand till 
* cold, and then bottle it, and cork it well. 

Obs. — ^This makes a fine, soft, mellow-flavoured Punch; 
and, added to melted butter, is a good relish to Puddings. ^ 

Syrup of Orange or Lemon Peel. — (No. 393.) 

Of fresh outer rind of Seville orange or Lemon-peel, three 
ounces, apothecaries' weight ; boiling water, a pint and a 
lialf ; infuse them for a night in a close ve§sel; then strain 
the liquor ; let jt stand to setthe ; and having poured it off 
clear from the sediment, dissolve it in two pounds of double 
refined loaf sugar, and make it into a syrup with a gentk

0^5.— In making this syrup, if the sugar be dissolved in 

.the i nfusion with as gentle a heat as possible, to prevent the 

exhalation of the volatile parts of the Peel, this syrup will 

possess a great share of the fine favour of the orange, or 

leraon-peel. 

Vinegar for Salads. — (No. 395.) 

** Take of Tarragon, — Savory, — Chives, — Eshallots, three 
ounces each, — ^a handful of the tops of Mint and Balni,^all 
dry and pounded ; put into a wide-mouthed Bottle, with a 
gallon of best Vinegar ; cork it close, set it in the Sun, and 
in a fortnight strain off, and squeeze the herbs, let it stand a 
day to settle, and then strain it through a filtering Bag.*' — 
From Parmentier's t^^rt de Faire les Vinaigresl 8vo. 
1805, p. 205. 

Tarragon Vinegar. — (No. 396.) 

• This is a very agreeable addition to Soups j Salad Sauce 
(No. 455,) and to mix Mustard (No. 370.) Fill a wide- 
mouthed bottle with fresh-gathered Tarragon leaves, i. e. 
between Midsummer and Michaelmas, (which should be 
gathered on a dry day, just before it flowers,) and pick the 
leaves off the stalks, and dry them a little before the fire ; 
cover them with the best Vinegar, let them steep fourteen 
days, then strain through a flannel Jelly Bag till it is fine, 
then pour it into half-pint bottles ; cork them carefully, and 
keep them in a dry place. 

Obs. — ^You may prepare E'der-flowers and Herl^s in the 
same manner ; Elder and Tarragon are those in most general 
use in this country. 

' Our neighbours, the French, prepare Vinegars flavoured 
with Celery, — Cucumbers,— Capsicums, — Garlick, — Eshal- 
lot, — Onion, — Capers, — Chervil, — Cress-seed, — Burner — 
Truffles, — Seville Orange Peel,— Ginger, &c. ; in short, they 
impregnate them with almost every Herb,— Fruit, — ^Flower, 
—and Spice separately, and in innumerable combinations. 

Messrs. Maille et Acloque, Vinaigriers a Paris^ sell 
65 sorts of variously flavoured Vinegars, and 28 different 
sorts of Mustard.

Basil Fmegar &r Jftnc.— (No. 397.) 

Sweet Basil is in full perfection about the middle of 
August. Fill a wide-mouthed bottle with the fresk green 
leaves of Basil, (these'give much iiner and more flavour than 
the dried,) and cover them with Vinegar— or Wine, — and let 
them steep for ten days ; if you ivish a very strong Essence, 
strain the liquor, put it on some fresh leaves, and let them 
steep fourteen days more. 

Obs, — ^This is a very agreeable addition to Sauces, — 
Soups, — and to the mixture usually made for Salads, see 
(No. 372,) and (No. 453.) 

It is a secret the makers of Mock Turtle may thank us 
for telling ; a table-spoonful put in when the Soup is finished, 
will impregnate a tureen of soup, with the Basil, and Acid 
flavours, at very small costs, when fresh Basil and Lemons 
are extrayagantly dear. 

The flavour of the other Sweet and Savoury Herbs, — 
Celery, &c. may be procured, and preserved in the same 
manner. See (No. 409,) or (No. 417,) by infusing them in 
wine — or vinegar. 

Cress Ftn<?^ar.— (No. 397*.) 

Dry and pound half an ounce of Cress Seed, (such as is 
sown in the garden with Mustard,) pour upon it a quart of the 
best Vinegar, let it steep ten days, shaking it up every day. 

Ohs, — This is very strongly flavoured with Cress,-Umd 
for Salads, and Cold Meats, kc. it is a great favourite with 
xnany ; — the Quart of Sauce costs only a Ualf^penny more 
than the Vinegar, 

Celery Vinegar is made in the same manner. 

The Crystal Vinegar (No. 407*,) which is, we believe, the 
PyroUgneotLS Acidy is the best for receiving flavours, — having 
scarcely any of its own. 

Green Mint Fin^jrar— <No. 398.) 

Is made precisely in the same manner, and with the same 
proportions, as in (No. 397.) 

Obs. — In the early season of Housed-Lamb, Green Mint 
is sometimes not to be got ; the above is then a welcome 
substitnte. 



FLAVQirftl^O ESSENCES. 319 

Burnei or Cucumber Vinegar, — (No. 399.) 

This TS made in precisely the same manner as directed in 
(No. 397.) The flavour of Burnet resembles Cucumber so 
exactly, that when infused in Vin^r, the nicest palate would 
pronounce it to be Cucumber. 

Obs. — ^This is a very favourite relish with Cold Meat, 
Salads, &c. 

Burnet is in hest season from Midsummer to Michaelmas. 

Horseradish Vinegar. — (No. 399*.) 

Horseradish is in highest perfection ahout November* 

Pour a quart of best Vin^r on three ounces of scraped 
Horseradish, an ounce of minced Eshallot, and one dracnm 
of Cayenne ; let it stand a week, and you will have an ex- 
cellent relish for Cold Beef, Salads, &c. costing scarcely any 
thing, 

N. B. A portion of Black Pepper and Mustard, Celti^ry or 
Cress-seed, onay be added to the above. 

06#.— Horseradish Powder (No. 458*.) 

Garlick Vinegar. — (No. 400.) 

Garlick is ready for this purpose from Midsummer to 
Michaelmas. 

Peel and chop two ounces of Garlick, pour on them a 
quart of white-wine Vinegar, stop the jar close, and let it 
steep ten days, shaking it well every day ; • then pour off the 
clear liquor into small bottles. 

Obs. — The Cook must be careful not to use too much of 
this : — a few drops of it will give a pint of Gravy a sufficient 
smack of the Garlick : the flavour of which, when slight, 
and well blended, is one of the finest we have ; — ^when^used 
in excess, it is the most offensive. 

The best way to use Garlick, is to send up some of this 
Vinegar in a Cruet, and let the company flavour their own 
Sauce as they like. 

N. B. The most elegant preparation of the Onion Tribe, 
is the EsHALLOT WiNB, (No. 402.)

N. B. Eshallots are in high perfection during July, 
August, and September.

lots, and infuse them in a pint of Sherry for ten days, — ^then 
pour off the clear liquor on three ounces more Shallots, and 
let the wine stand on them ten days longer.

the most elegant preparation q/* Esha'llot, and imparts the 
Onion flavour to Soups and Sauces, for Chops, Steaks, or 
boiled Meats, Hashes, &c. more agreeably than any : it does 
not leave any unpleasant taste in l£e mouth, 'or to the bieatfa,

CAYENNE PEPPER. 321 

Cayenne Pepper, — (No« 404.) 

Mr. Accum has informed the Public, (see his book oh 
Adulterations^) that from some specimens that came direct tc^ 
hifls from India, and others obtainedt from respectable Oil 
Shops in London, be has extracted Lead! 

*' Foreign Cayenne Pepper is an indiscriminate mixture of 
the powder of the dried pods of many species of Capsicums, 
—especially of the Bird Peppery which is the hottest of all. As 
it comes to us from the West Indies, it changes the infusion of 
Turnsole to a beautiful Green, probably owing to the Salt, 
which is always added to it, and the Red Oxide of Lead^ 
with which it is said to be adulterated." Duncan's New 
Edinburgh Dispensary y 1819, Article Capsicum^ p. 81.. 

The Indian Cayenne is prepared in a very careless manner, 
and often looks as if the pods had lain till tbey were decayed, 
before they were dried ; — this accounts for the dirty brown 
appearance it commonly has. If properly dried as soon as 
gathered, it will be of a cjear red colour : to give it the com- 
plexion of that made with gocd fresh gathered Capsicums or 
Chilies, some Annatto, or other Vegetable Red colouring 
matter, is pounded with it ; this, Mr. A. assures us, is fre- 
quently ?idulterated with Indian Red, i, e. " Red LeadP^ 

When Cayenne is pounded, it is mixed with a consider* 
able portion of Salt, to prevent its flying up and hurting ihe 
Eyes : this might be avoided, by grinding it in a Mill, which 
may easily be made close enough, especially if » it be passed 
through a second time, and then sifted through a fine drum- 
headed sieve, to produce as fine a powder as can be obtained 
by pounding ; however, our English Chilies may be pounded 
in a deep mortar without any danger. 

Capsicums and Chilies are ripe and red, and in finest con- 
dition during September and October ; they may.be purchased 
at the Herb Shops in Covent-Ciarden, the former for about 
live, the latter for two shilHngs per hundred. 

The flavour of the Chilies is very superior to that of the 
Capsicums, — and will be good in proportion as they are dried 
as soon as possible, taking care they are not burnt. 

Take away the stalks, and put the pods into a Cullender;

322 STORE SAUCES. 

set it before the Fire ; they 1711) take fall twelve hours to dry ; 
tt^en put them into a mortaf* with one-fbarth their weight of 
salty and pound them and rub them till theyvrefoie as pom" 
bUg and put them mto a well-stopped bottle. 

N.B. We advise tho»e who are fond of Cayenne not to 
think it too much trouble to make it of £ng:lish ChiUes, — 
there is no other way of being sure it is genuine* — and they 
will obtain a pepper of much finer flavour, without half the 
heat of the Foreign. 

A hundred large Chilies, costing only Two Shillings, will 
produce you about two ounces of Cayenne, — so it is as cheap 
as the commonest Cayenne. 

Four hundred Chilies, when the stems were taken off, weighed 
half a pound, and when dried produced a quarter of a pound 
of Cayenne Pepper. 

Essence of Cayenne, — (No. 405.) 

Put half an ounce of Cayenne Pepper {No. 404,) into half 
a pint of Brandy, or Wine ; let it steep for a fortnight, and 
then pour off the clear liquor. 

This is nearly equal to fresh Chili juice, ' 

Obs, — This or the Chili Vinegar (No. 405*,) is extremely 
convenient for the extempore seasoning, and finishing, of 
ISoups, Sauces, &c., its favour being instantly y and equally 
diffused, Cayenne Pepper varies so much in strength, that 
it IS impossible tp season Soup any other way to the precise 
point ofpiquance. 

Chili Finegar,—{No,U05*,) 

This is commonly made with the Foreign Bird Pepper^'- 

but you will obtain a much finer fiavour from infusing &fty 

fresh Red English Chilies (cut in. half, or poimded,) in a pint 

of the best Vinegar for a fortnight, or a quarter ounce of 

Cayenne Pepper (No. 404.) 

Obs, — Many p^ple cannot eat Fish without the additioa 
of an Acid, and Cayenne Pepper ; to such Palates this will 
be an agreeable relish. 

Chiliy or Cayenne Wine, — (No. 405**). 

Pound and steep fifty fresh Red Chilies, or a quarter of an 



LBMON PEEL AND JUICE. 323 

ounce of Cayenne Pepper, in half a pint of Brandy, White 
Wine, or Claret, for fourteen days. 

Obs. — This is a ^* Bonne Bouche^^ for the lovers of 
Cayenne, of which it takes up a larger proportion of its 
flavour, than 'of its fire: which being instantly diffused, 
it is a veiry useful auxiliary to warm and finish Soups and 
Sauces, &c. 

Essence of Lemon Peel. — (No. 407.) 

• Wash and brush clean the Lemons ; — let them get per- 
fectly dry :— 4ake a lump of Loaf Sugar, and rub them till all 
the yellow rind is taken up by the si^r ;-i-scrape off the 
surface, of the sugar into a preserving pot, and press it hard 
down ; cover it very close, and it will keep for some time. 

In the same way you may get the essence of Seville Orange 
Peel. 

Obs. — ^This method of procuring, and preserving the fla- 
vour of Lemon Peel, by making an OleO'Saccharum, is far 
superior to the common practice of paring off the rind, or 
grating it, and pounding, or mixing that with sugar : — ^by 
this process, you obtain the whole of the fine, fragrant, essen- 
tial Oil, in wnich is contained the flavour. 

Artificial Lemon Juice. — (No. 407*). 

If you add a drachm of Lump Sugar, pounded, and six 
drops of (No. 408,) to three ounces of Chrystal Vinegar, 
which is the name given to the Pyroligneous Vinegar, you 
will have an excellent substitute for Lemon Juice — for Fish 
Sauces and Soups, and many other culinary purposes. The 
flavour of the Lemon may also be compiunicated to the Vine- 
gar — ^by infusing some Lemon Peel in it. 

N. B.. The Pyroligneous Vinegar is perfectly free from all 
flavour, save that of the pure Acid, — therefore, it is a very 
valuable menstruum for receiving impregnations from various 
flavouring materials. 

The Pyro-ligNeous Acid seems likely to produce quite 
a revolution in the process of curins: Hams, Herrings, &c. &c.

table-spoonful with a quarter of a pint of thickened melted

To make a boat of Sauce for Poultry, &c. put a piece of

QUINT-ESSENCE OF ANCHOVY.*— (No. 433.J 

The goodness of this preparation depends almost entirely 
on having fine mellow Fish, that have been in pickle long 
enough [i, e. about twelve months) to dissolve easily, — ^yet 
are not at all rusty. 

Choose those that are in the state they come over in, not 
such as have been put into firesh Pickle, mixed with Red 
Pai)it,f which some add. to improve the complexion of the 
Fish, — it has been said, that otners have a trick of puttii^ 
Anchovy liquor on pickled Sprats :t you will easily discover 
this by washing one of them, and tasting the flesh of it, 
which in the fine Anchovy, is meUow, red, and high fla- 
vourc^d, and the bone moist and oily. Make only as much 
as will soon be used, the fresher it is the better. 

* The invention of this fdvourite Fish Sauce is claimed by Mr. 
Thos. YooD(;, see <' The Epicure/' Harding, London, iSlS, page 12. 
He sajs, ** there still is a cabal between some of the makers of tint 
sauce, which of tbem makes h best Though they do not pretend to 
the inventioo, all of tbem denominate themselves the best makeis. 
One is **the real maker ///'* another *• t/ie superior Hi*', another 
" the improved!!!*' another *• the original superior!!!'^ with cau- 
tions to guard against the '' spunoue makers."

I They may do very well for common palates ; but to imitate the 
fine flavour of the Gorgona fish, so us to impose upon a well-educated 
Gourmand, stiU remains in the catalogue of the Sauoe-maker's deside- 
rata. 



ESSENCE OF ANCHOVV. 331 

Put ten or twelve Anchovies into a mortar, and pound 
them to a pulp ; — put this into a very clean iron or silver, 
or very well tinned ♦ saucepan, then put a large table-spoon- 
ftd of cold sprii^ water (we prefer good vinegar) into the 
mortar, shake it round, and pour it to the pounded Ancho- 
vies, set them by the side of a slow fire, very frequently 
stirring them together, till they are melted, which they will 
be in the course of five minutes. — ^Now stir in a quarter of a 
drachm of good Cayenne pepper (No. 404), and let it re- 
main by the side of the fire for a few minutes longer ; then, 
while it is warm, rub it through a hair sieve,t with the 
back of a wooden spoon. 

The Essence of Anchovy which is prepared for the Com- 
mittee OP Taste, is made with double the above quantity 
of water — as they are of opinion that it ought to be so thin 
that it does not hang about the sides of the Bottle — ^when it 
does, the large surface of it is soon acted upon by the air, 
and becomes rancid and spoils ail the rest of it. 

A roll of thin cut Lemon-peel infused with the Anchovy, 
imparls a fine, fresh, delicate aromatic flavour, which is very 
grateful ; this is only recommended when you make Sauce 
fc# immediate use, — it will keep much belter without ; if 
you wish to acidulate it, instead of water make it with arti- 
ficial Lemon juice (No. 407*), or add a little of CoxweWs 
«)»CT«ee acid to it. 

Obs, — The above is the proper way to perfectly dissolve 
Anchovy,J and incorporate it with the water; which, if 
completely saturated, will continue suspended. 

To prevent the separ<Uion of Essence of Anchovy, and give 
it the appearance of being fully saturated with Fish, — va- 
rious other expedients have been tried, such as dissolving 
the fish in thin Water Gruel, or Barley Water, or thicken- 



* The best vessel for this purpose is tbe pint Baintnarie, sold bj

t Tlie Economist may take the thick remains that won*t pass

ingit with Mucilage, Flour, &c., — when any of these things 
ave added, it does not keep half so well as it does without 
them, and to preserve it, they overload it with Cayenne 
Pepper. 

Mem. You cannot make Essence of Anchovy half so cheap 
as you can buy it, — Thirty pHme Fish, weighing a pound 
and a quarter, and costing 49. 6d, and two table*spoonsf ul of 
water, made me only half a Pint of Essence, — you may 
commonly buy that quantity ready made for 25., and we 
have seen an Advertisement offering it for sale as low as 
2s. 6d, per Quart, 

It must be kept very closely stopped^ — when you tap a 
bottle of SaucCy throw away the old perforated Cork^ and 
put in a new taper velvet cork ; — if the . air gets to it^ the 
Fish takes the rust^* and it is spoiled directly. 

Essence of Anchovy is sometimes coloured f with bole 
Armeniac, Venice red, &c. ; but all these additions dete- 
riorate the flavour of the sauce, and the Palate and Stomach 
suffer for the gra ification of the Eye, which, in cuKnary 
concerns, will nev r be indulged by the sagacious Gotir- 
mand at the expense of these two primum mobiles of bis 
pursuits, ♦ 

*#* Essence of Anchovy is sometimes made with Sherry or 
Madeira wine, or good Mushroom catsup (No. 439), instead 
of water. If you like the a^id flavour y add a little citric 
acidj or dissolve them in good Finegar. 
' N.B. This is infinitely the most convenient way of lisin^ 
Anchovy, as each s;uest may mix sauce for himself, and 
make it strong or weak, according to his own taste. 

It is also much more Economical, as plain melted Butter 
(No. 256) serves for other purposes at table.

Pepper, grated Lemon Peel, and Citric Acid, 

Walnut Catsup.— (^o. 438.) 

Take six half sieves of green walnut shells, put them into 
a tub, mix them up well with common salt, from two to 
three pounds, let them stand for six days, frequently beating 
and mashing them ; by this time the shells become soft and 
pulpy, then by banking it up on one side of the tub, and at 
the same time by raising the tub on that side, the liquor will 
drain clear off to the other ; then take that liquor out : the 
mashing and banking up may be repeated as often as liquor 
is found. The quantity will be about six quarts. When 
done, let it be simmered in an iron boiler as long as any 
scum arises ; then bruise a quarter of a pound of ginger, a

quarter of a pound of allspice, two ounces of long pepper, 
two ounces of cloves, with the above ingredients, let it slowly

be filled quite up : cork them tight, seal them over, and put 
into a cool and dry place for one year before it is used^

MUSHROOM CATSUP.— (No. 439.) 

If you love Good Catsup, gentle reader, make it your- 
self,* afler the following directions, and you will have a deli- 
cious Relish for Made dishes, Ragouts, Soups, Sauces, or 
Hashes. 

Murhroom gravy, approaches the nature and flavour of 
Meat gravy, more than any vegetable juice ; and is the super- 
lative substitute for it, in Meagre Soups, and Extempore 
Gravies, the Chemistry of the Kitchen has yet contrived to 
agreeably awaken the Palate, and encourage the Appetite. 
; A couple of Quarts of Double Catsup, made according to 
the following Receipt, will save you some score pounds of 
Meat, besides a vast deal of time and trouble, as it will fiir- 
nish, in a few minutes, as good Sauce as can be made for 
either Fish, Flesh, or Fowl. See (No. 307.) 

I believe the following is the best way of extracting and 
preparing the Essence of Mushrooms, so as to procure, and 
preserve their flavour for a considerable length of time. 

Look out for Mushrooms from the beginning of Sep- 
tember. 

Take care they are the right sort, and fresh gathered. 
Full grown Flaps are to be preferred : put a layer of these 
at the bottom of a deep earthen pan, and sprinkle them with 
Salt, then another layer of Musnrooms, and some more salt 
on them, and so on alternately, salt and mushrooms ; — ^let

riads of insects.'' .

CATSUPS. 335 

them remain two or three hours, by which time the salt will 
liave penetrated the mushrooms, and rendered them easy to 
break ; — ^then pound them in a mortar, or mash them well 
with your hands, and let them remain for a couple of days, 
not longer, . sturing them up, and mashing them yrell each 
day ; — ^then pour them into a stone jar, and to each quart 
add an ounce and a half of whole Black Pepper, and half an 
ounce of allspice ; stop the jar very close, and set it in a 
stewpan of boiling water, and keep it boiling for two hours 
at least. — Take out the jar, and pour the juice clear from the 
settlings through a hair sieve (without squeezing* the. mush- 
rooms) into a clean stewpan ; let it boil very gently for half 
an hour ; those who are for Superlative Catsup, will 
continue the boiling till the Mushroom juice is reduced to 
half the quantity, it may then be called Double Ca^-sup or 
Do€j-sup. • ' 

There are sevelral advantages attending this concentration ; 
it will keep" much better, and only half the quantity be re* 
quired ; — so you can flavour Sauce, &c. without thinning it : 
— ^neither is this an extravagant way of making it, for merely 
the aqueous part is evaporated ; skim it well, and pour it 
into a cleaii dry jar, or jug ; cover it close, and let it stand in 
a cool place till next day, then pour it off as gently as possi<* 
ble, (so as not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the 
jug,) through a tammis, or thick flannel bag, till it is per- 
fectly clear ; add a table-spoonful of good Brandy to each 
pint of Catsup, and let it stand as before ; — a fresh sediment 
will be deposited, from which the Catsup is to be quietly 
poured off, and bottled in pints or half pints, (which have 
been washed with Brandy or spirit ;) it is best to keep it in 
such quantities as are soon used. 

Take especial care that it is closely corked, and sealed 
down, or dipped in Bottle Cement. 

If kept in a cool, dry place, it may be preserved for a long

time ; but if it be badly corked, and kept in a damp place, 
it will soon spoil. 

Examine it from time to time, by placing a strong light 
behind the neck of the bottle, and if any pellicle appears 
about it, boil it up again with a few peppercorns-. 

We have ordered no more Spice, &c. than is absolutely 
necessary to feed the Catsup, and keep it from fermenting, &c. 

The compound, commonly called Catsup, is generally an 
injudicious combination of so many different tastes, that the 
flavour of the Mushroom is overpowered by a farrago of Gar- 
lick, Shallot, Anchovy, Mustard, Horseradish, Lemon -peel, 
Beer, Wine, Spice, &c. 

Obs, — A table-spoonful of Double Catsup will impreg- 
nate half a pint of Sauce with the full flavour of Mushroom, 
in much greater perfection than either pickled, or powder of 
mushrooms* 

ffe have bought good Mushroom Catsup at Butler's herb 
and seed shop^ opposite Henrietta Street^ Covent Garden. 

Quintessence of Mushrooms. — (No. 440.) 

This delicate Relish, is made by sprinkling a little salt 
over either flap or button Mushrooms ; — three hours after, 
mash them, — ^next day, strain off the liquor that will flow 
from them, put it into a stewpan and boil it till it is reduced 
to half. 

It will not keep long, but is preferable to any of the Cat- 
, sups, which in order to preserve them, must have Spice, &c. 
which overpowers the flavour of the Mushrooms. 

•^n Artificial Mushroom Bed will supply this all the year 
round. 

To make Sauce with this, see (No. 307.) 

Oyster Catsup, — (No. 441.) 

Take fine fresh Milton oysters ; wash them in their own 
liquor, skim it, pound them in a marble mortar, to a pint 
of Oysters add a pint of Sherry, boil them up, and add an 
ounce of salt, two drachms of pounded mace, and one of 
Cayenne, — let it just boil up again, skim it, and rub it throii^h 
a sieve, and when cold, bottle it, and cork it well^ and s^ 
it down.

If this be well made, half an ounce (t. «• a table-spoonfal) 
•of it mixed with two table-spoonsful qf cold water, and 
stirred into a Soup or Sauce, just before you take it up, will 
thicken a pint of it to the consistence of Cream. 

O^.-9-Thvs preparation much resembles the ** Indian 
Airow Rooty ^ and is a good substitute for it; it gives a ful- 
ness on the palate to Gravies and Sauces at hardly any ex- 
pense, and by some is used to thicken Melted Butter instead 
of Flour. 

As it is perfectly tasteless^ it will tiot alter the flavour of 
the most delicate Broth, &c. 

Op the Flour of Potatobsl, 

** A patent has been recently obtained at Pans, a gold 
medal bestowed, and other honorary distinctions granted, for 
the discovery and practice, on a large scale^ of preparing 
from potatoes a fine flour ; a sago, a flour equal to ground 
rice, and a semolina or paste, of which lib. is equal to 1 ^Ib. 
rice, l|lb. vermicelli, or, it is asserted, 81bs. of raw potatoes. 

** These preparations are found valuable to mix with 
wheaten flour for bread, to make biscuits,' pastry, pie-crasts, 
and for all soups, gruels, and panada. 

'* iiarge engagements have been made for these prepanh 
tions with the French marine, and military and other hospi-i 
tals, with the approba^tion of the faculty. 

** An excellent bread, it is said, can be made of this ftoar, 
at half the cost of wheaten bread. 

" Heat having beep applied in these preparations, the 
articles will keep unchanged for years, and on board ship, -to 
China and back; rais, mice, worms, and insects do not in- 
fect or destroy this flour. 

*^ Simply mixed with cold water, they are in ten minutes 
fit for food, when fire and all other resource maybe wanted; 
and twelve ounces are suflicient for a daVs sustenancei in

To Dry Sweet, and Savoury Herbs. — (Na. 461.) 

• JPor the- fdllowing accurate and vahiahh Information tht 
Reader is indebted to Mr. Butler, Herbalist and Seedsman, 
fopposile Henrietta Street,) Covent Garden Market, of whom 
the several articles may be obtained of the best Quality, at 
the fair Market 'Price. 

•* It is very important to those who are not in the constant 
hahit of attending the markets, to know when the various 
seasons commence for. purchasing sweet h)e:rbs. 

** All Vegetables are ill the hiahest state of perfectiofiy and 
fiblltet of juice and flavour, just before they begin to flower : 
— the first and last crop have neither the fine flavour nor 
the perfume of th6s(B which are gathered in the height of th« 
season ; that is, when the greater part of the crop of each 
species is ripe. 

i^'^lPake Care they are gathetfed on a dry day, by which 
mecms they will have a better xioloiir when dried. Cleanst 
your herbs well from dirt and dust* cut off the roo'ts^ sepa* 
rate the bunches into smaller ones, and dry them by th» 
lieiit of a stove, or in a Dutch oven before a common fir^, in 
such qti^tities at a time, that the process may be speedily 
fimished, t. c. •* Kill *m gwtcA," ?ays a great Botanist ; — by 
this means, their flavour will be best preserved; — there can 
be no doubt of the .propriety of drying herbsy &c. hastily, by 
the aid of artificial heat rather than by the heat of the sun. 
In the. application of artificial heat, the only caution requi-^ . 
site is to avoid burning ; and of this, a sufficient test is af- 
forded by the preservation of the colour."— rThe common 
custom IS, when they are perfectly dried, to put them in 
Bags, and lay them in a dry place, but the best way to pre- 

* Thtt is sadly neglected by those who dry herbs for sale. If 70U 
buy tfaem ready dried, before you pound them, cleanse ttiem from dirt 
afed dnst, by stripping the leaves from the stalks, and rub them between 
your bands over a hair 8ieve,-^pat them into the siev^, and shalu

a tea-spoonful in a tumbler of water, is a very refreshing 
Summer Drink, and a great improvement to Punch*

Break into bits two Pounds (avoirdupois) of dotible ' rei. , 
fined Lump Sugar, and pUt it into a clean stewpan (that is 
well tinned,) with a pint of cold spring water ; when the 
Sugar is dissolved, s^t it over a moderate fire : beat about 
half the white of an Egg, put it to the Sugar before it gets 
warm, and, stir it well together. Watch it, and when it lK>ils 
take off th6 scum ; keep it boiling till no scum rises, and it 
is perfectly clear, then run it through a dean napkin •: put it 
into a close-stopped bottle ; it will keep for months, and is 
an Elegant Article on the Sideboard for Sweetening. 

06*,^— The ' proportion of Sugar ordered in the above 
Syrup, is a quarter pound more than that directed in • the 
Pharmacopoeia of the London College of Physicians. The 
q[uantity of Sugar must be as much as the liquor is capabfe

If you have none of (No. 408,) flavour your Syrup with 
thin cut Lemon Peel, or use Syrup of Lemon Peel (No. 393.)

half an hour. Take the pan from the fire, and pour the con- 
tents of the Jar into a Jelly-Bag : pass the jmce through a 
second time ; — (do not squeeze £e cag.) 

To each Pint of juice add a pound and a half of very good 
Ltunp Sugar pounded ; when it is dissolved, put it into a 
preserving pan, set it on the fire, and boil gently, stining and 
skimming it the whole time, (about thirty or forty minutes,)

Obs. — ^Jellies fr<mi other fruits are made in the same 
loay,— 9nd cannot be preserved in perfection without plenty 
of good Sugar. 

Those who wish Jelly to turn out very afi^,-— dissolve Isin- 
glass in a litde water, strain through a sieve, and add it in 
the proportion of half an ounce to a pint of Juice, and put it 
in with the Sugar. 

The best way is the cheapest, — Jellies made with too 
small a proportion of Sugar — require boiling so long— there 
ir much more waste of juice and flavour by evaporation than 
the due quantity of Sugar costs ; and they neither look nor 
taste halt so delicate, as when made with a proper propor** 
iton of Sugar, and moderate boiling.

CcUves'-feet Jelly.— (^o:4Sl.) 

Take four Calves* Feet, (not those which are sold at Tripe^ 
shops, which have been boiled till almost all the Gelatine is 
extracted,— but buy them at tfie Butcher's;) slit them in 
two, take away the Fat from between the claws, wash them 
well in lukewarm water, then put them , in a lai^e stein^pan, 
and cover them with water ; when the liquor boils, skim it 
well, and let it boil gently six or seven hours, that it may he. 
reduced to about two quarts, then strain it through a sieve, 
and skim all the oily substance which is on the surface of 
tlie liquor. 

If you are not in a hurry, it is better to Ixxl the Calves' feet 
the day Wfore you .make the Jelly, as when the liquor b 
cd^cl, the oily part being at the top, and the other beiog 
firm, with pieces of kitchen paper applied to it, you may re- 
move every particle of the oily substance, without wasting 
any of the Liquor. 

Put the L|quor in a stewpaii to melt, with a pound of 
Lump^ Sugar,' the peel of two Lemons, the.juiceot six, six 
whites of Eggs and shells beat together, and a bottle of 
Sherry or Madeira; whisk the whole together until it is on

COOK'S ORACLE. 



MADE DISHES, <fec. 



Receipts for Economical Made Dishes, written for the 
CooK*s Oracle — by an accomplished English Lady. 
—{No. 483.) 

These Experiments have arisen from my aversion to Cold 
Meaif and my preference of what are termed French 
Dishes ; with which (by a certain management) T think I can 
furnish my table at far less expense — ^than is generally in- 
curred in getting up a Plain Dinner. 

Gravy or Soup Meats I never buy, — and yet am seldom 
without a good provision of what is technically denominated 
Stock. 

When, as it frequently happens, we have Ham dressed, if 
the Joint be above the weight of seven pounds, I Ml^e it cat 
in half, and prepared in the following manner: — First, 
ensure that it has been properly soaked, scraped, and cleaned 
to a nicety, — then, put it into an Earthen Vessel as near its 
own size as possible, with just as much water as will cover it, 
to which add four Onions, a clove of Garlick, half a dozen 
Shallots, a Bay leaf, a bunch of Sweet herbs, half a dozen 
Cloves, a few Peppercorns and Allspice : this should be well 
closed, and kept simmering about three hours. It is then 
served with Raspings or with Glazing, the rind having first 
been taken off neatly. — ^The liquor is strained, and kept till 
Poultry of any sort, or Meat, is boiled, when the liquor in 
which they have been dressed should be added to it, and 
boiled down fast till reduced to about three pints : when 



MADIS DISHES, kc. 267 

cold, it will be a highly flavoured, well coloured Jelly,* and 
ready lor Sauce for all kinds of Rago-dts and Hashes, &c. && 

A Fillet op Veal, I divide into Thru Parts; the 
Meat before it is skewered, will of itself indicate where the 
paititioii is natural, and will puU asunder as you would 
quarter an Orange i-^he Largest Piece should be stuffed 
with (No. 374, or 375), and roHed up, compactly skewered^ 
&c. and makes a iFery pretty small FtUebr-^he square JUu 
Piece will either cut into Cutlets (No. 90, or 521), or sikc 
for a Pie — and the T%ick Piece must be well larded and 
dressed as a Prieandeau — ^which I do in the following man- 
ner : — Put the larded Veal into a stewpan just big enough to 
coiit»n it, with as much water as will cover it ; when it haB 
simmered till delicately white, and so tender as to be cut with 
a Spoon, it must be taken out of the water and set apart,-— 
aad it will be ready to serve up either with Sorrel, Tomata^ 
Mushrooms (No. 305, or 439), or some of the above-men- 
tioned Stock— the Fricanehati being previously coloured with 
Glazing — if with Muslffooms, they should be fwst parboiled 
in Salt and Vinegar, and water, which gives^ them flavour, 
and keeps them good colour. 

The Sirloin of vbbf / likewise divide ifito Three 
Parts; I ferst have it nicely 6oncrf. 

The Under party or Fillet^ as the French call it, will dress ' 
(when cut into slices) excellently, either as plain Steaks (r*cx 
94), Curry (No. 197) ; or, it may be larded whole, and 
gently stewed in two quarts of water (a Bay leaf, two 
Onions, their skins roasted brown, foar Ctoves, Allspce*, 
&c. &c.) till tender, when it should be taken out, drained 
quite dry, and put away — ^it is then ready to be used at any 
time in the following manner : — Season and dredge it well^ 
then put it into a stewpan in which a piece of Butter has 
been previously fried to a fine froth ; when the Meat is siafr 
ficiently brown, take it out, and throw into the pan half a 
dozen middle-sized Onions to do a fine Gold Colour ; that 
accomplished, (during which the Dredger should be in coin 
utant use,) add half a pint of Stock, and a tea- spoonful of Tar*

ragon Vinegar (No. 396),.and let the Onions stew gently titt 
nearly tender : the Beef should then be returned to the stew- 
pan, and the whole suffered to simmer till the meat is ^rarm 
through : care must be taken that the Onions do not bieak, 
and they should be served round the Beef with as much 
Sauce as will look graceful in the dish. The Fillet is like- 
wise very good without the fried Onions; — ^in that, case, you 
should chop and mix up together, a Shallot, some Parsley, a 
few Capers and the Yolk of a hard £igg, and strew them 
lightly over the surface of the Beef. 

. The Fat End of the Sirloin and Bones should be put to 
simmer in the liquor, in which the Fillet was first stewed, 
and done till the Beef looks loose ; it should then be put 
away into a deep vessel, and the Soup strained over it, 
which cooling with the Fat upon the top (thereby excluding 
the air), will keep as long as may be required; — when the 
Soup is to be used, the fat must be cleared frpm it, — a Carrot, 
Parsnip, a head of Celery, a Leek, and three Turnips, 
cleaned and scalded^ shou3d be added to it, and the wl|ole 
suffered to simmer gently till the vegetables are quite done, 
when they must be strained from the liquor, and the So^p 
served up with large square thick pieces of toasted bread. 

Those who like a Plain BouWi warm the Beef in the 
Soup, and serve it up with the Turnips and Carrots which 
had been strained before from the Soup. A White Cabbe^ 
quartered, is no bad addition to the Garnish of the BouiUi, 
or to the flavour of the Soup. If it is a Dressed BouOli, 
sliced Carrots and Button Onions should be stewed in 
thickened Stock, and poured over the Meat 

AiN'eck of Mutton^ boned, sprinl^ed with, dried Sage, 
powdered fine, or (No. 378) seasoned and rolled and 
roasted, is very good. T%e Bones and Scrag make excels 
lent Gravy stewed down, and if done very ^ntly, the Meat is 
•not bad eating. The same herbs should be put to it, as to 
other, Stocks, with the addition of a Carrot ; this will make 
very good Muttoii Broth, In short, wherever there are 
Bones or Trimmings to be got out of any Meat that is dressed 
in my Kitchen, they are made to contribute towards Soup or 
Gravy, or (No. 252.) 

Instead q^ roasting ^Uaue (which at best is but dry food), 



. MADE DISHES, &€• 359 

^ew it, if Young, Plain,— if an Old on^, Lafd it The 
Shoulders and hegs should be taken off, and the Back cut 
into three pieces ; these, with a Bay leaf, half a dozen Shal- 
lots, one Onion pierced with four Cloves, should be laid with 
as much good vinegar as will cover them, for twenty-four hours 
in a deep dish. In the mean time, the Head, Neck, Ribs, 
J>iver, Heart, &c. &c. should be browned in frotKed Butter 
well seasoned — add half a pound of lean Bacon cut into 
small pieces, a large bunch of Herbs, a Carrot, and a few 
Allspice — simmer these in a quart of waiter till it be reduced 
to about half the quantity, when it should be strained, and 
those parts of the Hare which have been in^sed in the viiie- 
^r, should (with the whole contents of the dish) be added to 
it, and stewed tiU quite done. Those who like Onions may 
brown half a dozen, stew them iu a part of the Gravy, and 
dish them round the Hare. 

When it comes from the table, supposing some to be left, 
the Meat should he taken from the Bones, and with a few 
Forcemeat balls, the remains of the Gravy, and about a 
quarter of a pint of Red Wine, and a proportionable quantity 
of water, it will make a very pretty Soup— to those who 
have no objection to Catsup, (No. 439), a spoonful in the 
original Gravy is an improvement, as indeed it is in every 
made Dish where the Mushroom itself is not at command. 

Every RagoilUy in my opinion, should be dressed the day 
before it is wanted, that any Fat which has escaped the skim- 
ming spoon, may with ease be taken off when cold. 

Calf's Head. — Take the half of one, with the skin on, 
— -^mt it into a large stewpan with as much water as will 
eo^et it, a knuckle of Ham, and the usual accompaniments 
of Onions, Herbs, &c. &c. and let it simmer till the flesh 
may be separated from the bone with a spoon—- <lo so, and 
while still hot, cut it into as large a sized square as the piece^ 
will ladmit of; — the trimmings and half the liquor put by in 
a tureen ; to the remaining half add a gill of White Wine, 
and reduce the whole of that by quick boiling till it is again 
\talf consumed, when it should be poured over the la^ 
1K{m}pe piece in an Earthen Vessel surrounded with Mush- 
rooms, white Button Onions,. small pieces of Pickled Pork 



360 MADE BlSSfiS, &C. 

M( an inch in breadth, and one and a half in lengdi), and 
the tongue in slices, wad simraered till the whole is fit to 
serrenp; some browned Forcemeat balls are a pretty addtioD. 
After this comes from the Table, the remains slK>uld be cut 
into small pieees, and mixed up with the trimmings and 
liquor, which (with a little more wine) properly thickened, 
will make a very good Mock Turtle Sowp for a futiire 
occasion. 



To Hash Mutton, ^c^l^o. 484.) 

Cut the Meat into slices, about the thickness of two shil- 
lings, trim oW all the sinews, skin and gristle, &c. — fmt t» 
nothing hut what is to be eaten^ lay them on a plate, ready; 
prepare your Sauce to warm it in, as receipt (No. 360), or 
(No. 451), or (No. 486), put in the Meat, and let it shmner 
gently till it is thoroughty warm : — do not let it BoiU <u that 
will make the Meat tough and hardy* and it will be, as 
Joan CnoBiWELLf has it, a Harsh, 

Obs. — Select for your Hash those parts of the joifU that 
are least dofie. 

Mem. Hashing is a mode of Cookery by no means suited 
to delicate stomachs ; unless the Meat, &c. be conaideiably 
undier^done the first time— « second dressing ihust spoil i^ 
for what is done enough the First time, must be dme too 
mueh the Second. 



* Hashb<i and llleati dressed it second time; should onfy simmer 
gewthf^ unjust warm tbtoagh : H is supposed they have beeo done 
very nearly, ii' not quite enough, already : select those parts o( the joist 
that have been least done. 

In making a Hash from, a Leg of Mutton, do not destroy the Har- 
row bone to help Ifie gravy of your hash, to which it will make no p«- 
ceptible addition.; hut saw it in two, twist writing paper lonodtfc

* The ** Baine- Marie,*' or WATUii-BAtH, see note to (No. 529), 
if the best utensil to wann up made dishes, and things that have been 
already sufficiently dressed, as it neither consumes the sauce, nor 
hardens the meat:— if you have not a Water-Bath, a Dutch OvenmU 
sometimes supply the place of it. 

" Bain-Marie'^ is a flat vessel coo lainiDg boiling water ; you put all 
your stewpans into tbd ^ater, and keep that vvater always very hot, but 
it must not boil : the effect of this Bain Marie is to Iceep every thioff 
warm without altering either the quantity or the quality, particularly 
the quality-. When I had the honour of serving a Nobleman, who kept 
a very eitensive hunting establishment, and the hour of dinner wasoon- 
noaemly uncertain, I was in the habit of using Bain Marie, as a 
mktJm means of preserving the flavour of all my dishes. If you kec^ 
your sauoe, or broth, or soup, by the fireside, the soup reduces, and be- 
comes too strong, and the sauce thickens as well as reduces. This is 
the best way of warming Turtle, or Mock Turtle Soup,— as the thick 
part is always at the bottom, and this method prevents it from burning, 
and kseps it always good."— Udb's Cookerf, pag« IS,

Cold Meat Broiled^ wUh Poached Eggs,--- (No. 487.) 

Tlie inside of a Sirloin of Beef is best for this dish, or a 
Leg of Mutton. Cut the slices of even and equal thickness, 
and brdiland brown them carefully and slightly over a clear 
smart fire, or in a Dutch oven, give ihose slices most fire

full, — ^a small spoonful of white pepper, and about one and 
a half of salt, and three gills of broth or gravy, and two tea- 
spoonfiils of Mushroom Catsup, cover all very close in, so as 
to prevent the steam from getting out, and let them stew for 
an hour and a half on a very slow fire. A small slice of 
ham is a great addition to this dish. The Cook will be the 
best judge when it is done, as a great deal depends on the 
fine you have.

Savoury Salt Beef Bafted.— (No. 406,) 

The Tongue Side of a ronnd of Beef is the best bit for 
this purpose ; if it weighs fifteen pounds let it hang two or 
three days ; then take three ounces of Saltpetre, one ounce 
of coarse Sugar, a quarter of an ounce of Black pepper, and 
same of Allspice, (some add a quarter of an ounce oif Ginger, 
or (No. 457), and some minced sweet and savoury Herbs 
(No. 459), and three-quarters of a pound of common S^lt; 
incorporate these ingredients by pounding them together ia 
a mortar ; then take the bone out, and rub the Meat well 
with the above mixture, tnrning it and rubbing it every c^y 
for a fortnight. 

When you dress it, put it into a pan with a quart of 
water ; cover the meat with about three pounds of muttoo 
suet * shredded rather thick, and an onion or two minced 
small ; cover the whole with a flour crust to the top or brim 
of the pan, and let it be baked in a moderate oven for abont 
six hours, (or, just cover it with water, and let it stew very 
gently for about five hours, and when you send it to table, 
cover the top of it with finely cheeped Parsley.) If the

expense of proving the Receipts of our predecessors, — and set 
about recording these results of our own Experiments, — we 
Gould not find one Receipt that approximated to any thing 
like an accurate description of the way in which this excellent 
dish is actually dressed in the best Alamode Beef Shops ; — 
from whence, of course, it was impossible to obtain any 
information : — ^however, after all, the whole of the secret 
seems to be the thickening the gravy of Beef that has been 
very slowly-f stewed, and flavouring it with Bay leaves and 
Allspice. 

Take about eleven pounds of the Mouse Buttock,— or 
Clod of Beel',— or a Blade Bone,— or the Sticking piece, or 
the like weight of the Breast of Veal ; cut it into pieces of 
three or four ounces each ; put three or four ounces of Beef 
drippings, and mince a couple of large Onions, and put 
them into a large deep stewpan ; as soon as it is quite hot, 
flour the Meat, put it into the stewpan, keep stirring it with 
a wooden spoon ; when it has been on about ten minutes 



* If you have no Brotb»— put in half a pint of water, thicken it as in 
the above receipt, andl just before you give it the last boil up, add to it 
a larire spoonful of Mushroom Catsup, and, if you like, the same quan- 
tity of Port wine.

a powerful claim to approbation.'^ — Tabella Cibaria, p. 47.

To Pot Beef, — Veal, — Game, or Poultry, &c, 

(No. 503.) 

Take three pounds of lean Gravy Beef, rub it well with an 
ounce of Saltpetre, and then a hsmdful of common Salt ; let' 
it lie in Salt for a couple of days, rubbing it well each day, 
then put it into an earthen pan, or stone jar that will just- 
hold it, cover it with the skin and fat that you cut off, aad 
pour in half a pint of water ; cover it close with paste, and 
set it in a very slow oven for about four hours ; — or prepare 
it as directed in (No. 496.) 

When it comes from the Oven, drain the gravy from it 
into a basin, pick out the gristles and the skins, mince it 
fine, moisten it with a little of the Gravy you poured from 
the Meat, which is a very strong Consommi (but rather salt,) 
and it will make excellent Pease Soup, or Browning, (see 
No. 322,) pound the Meat patiently and thoroughly in a 
mortar with some fresh Butter,* till it is a fine paste, (to 
make Potted Meat smooth there is nothing equal to plenty 
of Elbow-grease) — ^seasoning it (by degrees as you are heal- 
ing it) with a little Black Pepper and Allspice,— or Cloves 
pounded, or Mace, or grated Nutmeg. 

Put it in pots^ press it down as close as possible, and 
cover it a quarter of an inch thick with Clarified Butter ; to 
prepare which, see receipt (No. 259,) and if you wish to 
preserve it a long time, over that tie a Bladder. Keep it in ' 

a dry pltee. i

* The less Gravy or Batter, and the more beating tht better will be 
yoor Potted Beef, if you wish it to keep ; — if for immediate' eating, 
you may put in a larger proportion t)f gravy or butter, as the meat \vill 
pound easier, and look and taste nfore maUovr.

Obs. — ^You may mince a little Ham or Bacon^—or an 
Anchovy, — Sweet or .Savoury Herbs,— or a Shallot, and a 
liule Tarragon, Chervil, or Burnet, &c., and pound them 
with the Meat, with a glass of Wine, or some Mustard, or 
Forcemeat (No. 376, or 378, and 399*, &c. ;) if you wish 
to have it Devilish savoury, add RagoiU Powder (No. 467,) 
CSwrry Powder (No. 455,) or Zest (No. 255,) and moisten it 
with Mushroom Catsup (No. 439,) or Esserice of Anchovy 
(No. 433,) or Tincture of Allspice (No. 413,) or. Essence 
of Turtle (No. 343».) 

Or,— (No. 503».) 

• It is a very agreeable and economical way of using the re- 
mains of Game, or Poultry, or a large joint of either roasted 
or boiled Beef, Veal, Ham, or Tongue, &c. to mince it, with 
some of the Fat, (or moisten it with a little Butter, or (No. 
439^) &c.) and beat it in a morlar with the seasoning, &c., 
as in the former Receipt. 

When either the Teeth or Stomach are extremely feeble, 
especial care must be taken to keep Meat till it is tender 
before it is cooked— or call in the aid of those excellent 
helps to bad teeth the Pestle and Mortar. ^ — And see (Nos. 
10, 18, 87, 89, 175. 178 ; from 135 to 250, 502, 543— 
and especially 503.) Or dress in the usual way whatever 
is b^st liked — mince it, put it into a mortar, and pound it 
with a little Broth or melted Butter, — ^Vegetable, — Herb,— 
Spice, — Zest (No. 255,) &c., according to the taste, &c of 
the Later. The business of the Stomach is thus very mate- 
rially facilitated. 

" Flesh in small quantities, bruised to a pulp, may be very 
advantageously used in fevers attended with debility."—

" Mincing or Pounding Meat — saveth the grinding of the 
Teeth ; and therefore, (no doubt) is more nourishii^, espe- 
cially in Agej-^-or to them that have weak teeth ; but butter 
is not proper for weak bodies, — ^and therefore, moisten it ia 
pounding with a little Claret wine, and a very little Cinna-

foregoing Receipt, and it will make as good Potted Beef, as 
Meat that has been baked till its moisture is entirely extracted,

For this, as for a Hash, select those parts of the joi^it that 
have been least done ; — it is generally made with slices of 
cold boiled salted Beef, sprid^led with a little Pepper, and 
just lightly browned with a bit of Butter in a frymgpan : if 
it is fried too much it mil be hard. 

Boil a Cabbage, squeeze it quite dry, and chop it small; 
trite the Beef out of the frying-pan, and lay the Cabbage in 
it ; sprinkle a little pepper and salt over it : keep the pen 
moving over the fire for a few minutes ; lay the Cabbage in

SUces of Ham or Bacon* — (No, 526.) 

Ham, x>T Bacon, may be fried, or broiled on a gridiron 
over a clear "fire, or toasted with a fork : — take care to 
slice it of the same thickness in every part. 

If you wish it curled, cut it in slices about two inches 
long, \\f lonp;er, the outside will be done too much, before 
the inside is done enough;) roll it up, and put a little 
wooden skewer through it: put it in a Cheese-toaster, or 
Dutch oven, for eight or ten minutes, turning it as it gets 
crisp. 

This is considered the handsomest way of dressing Bacon ; 
— ^but we like it best uncurled, because it is crisper, and 
more equally done. 

06«.r— Slices of Ham or Bacon should not be more than 
half a quarter of an inch thick, and will eat much more mel- 
low if soaked in hot water for a quarter of an hour, and then 
dried in a cloth before they are broiled, &c. 

Relishing Rashers of Bacon. — (No. 527.) 

If you have any Cold Bacon, you may make a very nice 
dish of it by cutting it into slices about a quarter of an inch 
thick ; grate some crust of bread, as directed for Ham, see 
^No. 14,) and powder them well with it on both sides; lay 
the rashers in a Cheese-toaster, — they will be browned on 
one side in 'about three minutes; — turn them and do the 
other.

Hashed Venison. — (No. 528.) 

If you have enough of its own Gravy left, it is preferable 
to any to warm it up in : — ^if not, talfe some of the Mutton 
Gravy (No. 347,) or the bones and trimmings of the joint, 
(aQer you have cut off all the handsome slices you can, to 
make we hash ;) put these into some water, and stew them 
gently for an hour : then put some butter into a stewpan ; 
when melted, put to it as much flour as will dry up the 
butter,, and stir it well together; add to it, by degrees, the 
Gravy you have been making of the trimmings, and some 
Red Currant Jelly, give it a boil up, skim it, strain it tbroc^

Put the trimmings and gravy ydu have left, with half a 
pint of water, (there should be a pint of liquor,) and a table- 
spoonful of Currant Jelly, into a clean stewpan, and let it 
boil gently for a quarter of an hour, then strain it throiK;h a 
sieve into a basin, and pour it back into the stewpan ; now 
flour the Hare, put it into the gravy, and let it simmer veiy 
gently till the Hare is warm (about twenty minutes,) cut the 
Stuffing into slices, and put it into the hash to get warm^ 
about five minutes before you serve it ; divide the head, and 
lay one half on each side the dish.

by Lloyd,. No. 178, Strand,) or into a Stcme Jar,* just 
sufficiently laree to well hold it ; put in some Sweet Herbs, 
h roll or two of rind of a Lemon, or a Seville Orange, and a 
fine large Onion with five cloves stuck in it, — and if you wish 
to preserve the flavour of the Hare^ a quarter pint of water ; 
if you are for a Ragoiiti a quarter pint of claret, or Port wine, 
and the j uice of a Seville Orange, or Lemon : tie the jar 
down closely with a bladder, so that no steam can escape ; 
put a little hay in the bottom of the saucepan, in which place 
the jar, and pour in water till it reaches within four inches oi 
the top of the jar ; let the water boil for about three hours, 
according to the age and size of the hare, (take care it is not 
over^dane^ which is the general fault in all made dishes, 
especially this,) keeping it boiling all the time, and fill up 
the pot as it boils away. When quite tender, strain off the 
gravy clear from fat, thicken it with Hour, and give it a boil 
up : — ^lay the Hare in a soup-dish, and pour the gravy to it.

Prepare the Hare the same as for jugging, put it into a 
stewpan with a few Sweet Herbs, half a dozen Cloves, the 
same of Allspice and Black pepper, two large Onions, and a 
roll of Lemon peel : cover it with water ; when it boils,, 
scum it clean, and let it simmer gently till tender (about two 
hours,) then take it up with a slice, set it by the fire to keep 
hot while you thicken the gravy ; take three ounces of butter, 
and some flour, rub together, put in the gravy, stir it well, 
and let it boil about ten minutes, strain it through a siieve, 
over the Hare, and it is ready. 

Dressed Ducks, or Geese Hashed, — (No. 530.) 

Cut an Onion into small dice ; put. it into a stewpan, with 
a bit of Butter ; fry it, but do not let it get any colour : put 
as much boiling water into the stewpan as will make sauce 
for the hash ; thicken it with a little flour, cut up the duck, 
and put it into the sauce to warm ; do not let it boil ; season 
it with pepper and salt, and catsup. 

N. B. The Legs of Geese, &c. hroiled, and laid on abed 
of Apple Sauce, are sent up for Luncheon or Supper. 

Or, 

Divide the Duck into joints ; lay it by ready : put the 
trimmings and stuffing into a stewpan, with a pint and a half

Bird ; then stiain off the liquor, and leave the Ducks by the 
fire to keep hot, scum the fat off; — put into a clean stewpan 
two ounces of Butter, when it is hot, stir in as much flour as 
will make it of a stitf paste, add the liquor by degrees, let it

till just nicely tender, this will be an acceptable Bonne 
Bouche to those who are fond of Made Dishes. The flavour 
may be varied by adding Catsup, — Curry Powder,— or any 
of the flavoured Vinegars. 

This is an easy prepared side dish, especially when you

stimulant to the powers of both. The provocatives used on such occa- 
sions, an ungrateful world has combined to term devils. 

*' The diahkt aufeu d*enfer, or dry devifs, are usunUy composed of 
the broiled legs and gizzards of poultr}', fisb-bones> or biscuit.*, and, if 
pungency alone can justify their appeUntion, never was title better de- 
served, for they are usually prepared without any other attention than 
to make them ** hot as their native element/^ and any one who can 
swallow them without tears in his eyes, need be under no apprehension 
of the pains of futurity. It is true, they answer the purpose of exciting 
thirst; but they excoriate the palate, vitiate its nicer powers of discri- 
mination, and pall the relish for the high flavour of good wine : in 
shorty no man should venture upon them whose throat is not paved with 
mosaic, unless they be seasoned by a cook who can poise the pepper- 
box with as even a hand as a judge should the scales of justice. 

*' It would be an insult to tiie understanding of our readers, to sup- 
pose them ignorant of the usual mode of treating comnioa devils ; but 
we shall make no apology for giving the most minute instructions f(V 
the preparation of a gentler stimulant, which, besides, possesses this 
advantage— that it may be all done at the table, either by yourself, or at 
least under your own immediate inspection.

boiled egg, a small portion of pounded mace, the grated peel of half s 
lemon, and half a spoonful of soy, until the ingredients be brought to the 
consistence of a fine paste : then add a table>^poonful of catsup^ a full

sauce, along wkh the birds, into a silver stew-d^sh to be lieated with 
spirits of wine— -cove? dose up — light the lamp — and keep gently sim- 
mering, and occasionally stirring, until the flesh has imbibed' the greater 
ji)art of the liquid. When yoa have reason to suppose it is completely 
saturated, pour in a small quantity of salad oil, stir all onoe more well 
together, ** put out the light, and (hen ! "' — serve it round instantly ; for 
it is scarcely necessary to say, that a devil should not only be hotis' 
itself, but eaten hot. 

*' There is, however, one precaution to be used in eating it, to which 
we most earnestly recommend the most particular attention, and for 
want of which, more than one accident has occurred. It is not, as 
some people might suppose-— to avoid eating too much of it — for that 
your neighbours will take good care to prevent; but it is this:— in 
order to pick the bones, you must necessarily take some portion of it 
with your fingers; and, as they thereby become impregnated with it» 
flavour, if you afterwards chance to let them touch your toi^goe — ^yo» 
will infallibly lick them to the bone, if you do not swaUow them entire.'*

off the cru§t to eat with cheese ; — ^to supply this — and to eat 
with Soups, &c. — ^puli lightly into small pieces, the crumb

Toast and Cheese. — (No. 539.) 

** Happy the man that has each fortune tried, 
To whom she much has giv*n, and much denied ; 
With abstinence all delicates he sees, 
And can regale himself on toast and cheese.'' 

Ki N o*s Jrt of Cookery. 

Cut a slice of Bread about half an inch thick, pare off the 
crust, and toast it very slightly on one side so as just to brown 
ity without making it hard or burning it. 

Cut a slice of' Cheese (good fat mellow Cheshire cheese, 
or double Gloster, is better than poor, thin single Gloster), 
a quarter of an inch thick, not so big as the bread by half 
an inch on each s'de ; — pare off the rind,— cut out all the 
specks and rotten parts,* and lay it on the toasted Bread in a 
cheese-toaster ;— carefully watch it, that it does not bum, 
and stir it with a spoon, to prevent a pellicle forming on the 
surface. Have, ready good Mustard, Pepper and Salt. 
. If you observe the directions here given, the Cheese will 
eat mellow, and will be uniformly done, and the Bread crisp 
and soft, and will well deserve its ancient appellation of a 
** Rare Bit:' 

Ohs. — ^Qne would think nothing can be easier, than to 
prepare a Welsh Rabbit ;^^yetf not only in Private families, 
but at Taverns, it is very seldom sent to table in perfection.

Toasted Cheese^ No. 2.— (No. 540.) 

We have nothing to add to the directions given for toast- 
ing the Cheese in the last receipt, except that in sending it 
up, — it will save mtmh Time in portumi'ng it out at table, if 
you have half a dozen small Silver or Tin pans to fit into 
the Cheese Toaster, and do the Cheese in these : each per- 
son may then be helped to a separate pan, and it will keep 
the Cheese much hotter than the usual way of eating it oa a 
cold plate. 

Mem. — Send up with it as many CobUrs* as you hate 
Pans of Cheese. 

Obs. — Ceremony seldom triumphs more completely over 
Comfort, than in the serving out of this dish ; — ^which, to be 
presented to the Palate in perfection, it is imperatively indis- 
pensable, that it be introduced to the Mouth as soon as it 
appears on the Table. 

Buttered Toast and Cheese, ^(l^o. 541.) 

Prepare a round of Toast; — ^butter it ; — grate over it good 
Cheshire Cheese about half the thickness of the toast, and 
^ve it a brown. 

Pounded Cheese. ^(^o. 542.) 

Cut a pound of good mellow Chedder, Cheshire or North 
Wiltshire cheese into thin bits, add to it two, and if the 
Cheese is dry, three ounces of fresh Butter, pound and rub 
them well together in a mortar till it is quite smooth. 

06«.--*-When Cheese is dry, and for those whose digestion 
is feeble, this is the best way of eating it, and spread on 
Bread, it makes an excellent Luncheon or Supper. 

N. B. The piquance of this is sometimes increased by 
pounding with it Curry Powdei:, (No. 455), Grormid Spice, 
Black Pepper, Cayenne, and a little made Mustard ; and 
some moisten it with a glass of Sherry. If pressed down 
hard in a jar, and covered with clarified Butter, it will keep 
for several days in cool weather.

MACCARONI. 395 

Maccaroni.-— (No. 543.) See Maeearom PudiUng for the 

Boiling it. 

The usual mode of dressing it in this country is by adding a 
white sauce, and Parmesan or Cheshire cheese, and burn- 
ing it ; but this makes a dish which is proverbially unwhole- 
some : but its bad qualities arise from the oiled and burnt 
cheese^ and the half-dressed flour and butter put into the 
white sauce. 

Maccaroni plain boiled, and some rich stock or portable 
soup added to it quite hot, will be found a delicious dish, 
and very wholesome. Or boil Maccaroni as directed in the 
receipt for the Pudding, and serve it quite hot , in a deep 
tureen, and let each guest add grated Parmesan smd cold 
.butter, or oiled butter served hot, and it is excellent; this is 
the most common Italian mode of dressing it. Maccaroni, 
with Cream, Sugar, and Cinnamon, or a little Fance/lt added 
to the Cream, makes a very nice sweet dish. 

English way of dressing MaosaronL 

Put a quarter of a pound of Ribbon Maccaroni into a stew- 
pan with a pint of boiling Milk, or Broth, or Water ; let it 
boil gently till it is tender, this will take about a quarter of an 
hour — ^then put in an ounce of grated cheese, and a tea- 
spoonful of sdt, mix it well together, and put it on a dish — 
and strew over it two ounces of grated Parmesan or Cheshire 
Cheese^— and give it a light brown in. a Dutch oven. — Or 
put all the Cheese into the Maccaroni, and put Bread crumbs 
over the top. 

Maccaroni is very good put into a thick Sauce with some 
shreds of dressed Ham, or in a Curry Sauce. Riband Mac- 
caroni is best for these dishes, and should not be done so 
much. 

Maccaroni Pudding. 

One of the most elegant preparations of Maccaroni is the 
Timhalle de Mac(?aronu Simmer half a pound of Maccaroni 
in plenty of water, and a table-spoonful of salt, till it is 
tenriler ; but take care not to have it too soft ; though tender 
it should be firm, and the form entirely preserved, and no 
part beginning to melt, (this caution will serve for the pre- 



396 OMELETTES. 

pa ration of all Maccaroni). 'Strain the water from it — beat 
op five yolks of the white of two eggs — take half a pint of 
the best cream, and the breast of a fowl, and some thin 
slices of Ham. Mince the breast of • the' fowl with the 
Uam — add them with from two to three table-spoonsful 
of finely grated Parmesan Cheese, and season with Pi^per 
and Salt. Mix all these with the Maccaroni, and pot 
into a pudding mould well buttered, and then let it steam in 
a stewpan of boiling water for about an hour, and serve quite 
hot, with rich gravy (as in Omelette). See (No. 543*.) 

06f .— This, we have been informed, is considered by a 
Grand Gourmand, as the most important recipe which was 
added to the collection of his Cook during a gastronomic tour 
through Europe : it is not an uncommon mode of preparii^ 
Maccaroni on the continent. 

Omelettes, and various ways of dressing Eggs, — (No. 543*.) 

There is no dish which in this countiy may be con- 
sidered a3 coming under the denomination of a Made Dish of 
the second order, which is so generally eaten, if good, as an 
Omelette ; and no one is so often badly dressed : it is a very 
faithful assistant in the construction of a dinner. 

When you are taken by surprise, and wish to make an 
appearance beyond what is provided for the every day dinner, 
a little portable soup melted down, and some Zest (No. 255), 
and a few Vegetables, will make a good broth — a pot of the 
stewed veal of Morrison's, warmed up, — an Omelette, — and 
some Apple or Lemon Fritters, can all be got ready' at ten 
minutes notice, and with the original foundation of a Leg of 
Mutton, or a piece of Beef, will make up a very good dinner 
when taken by surprise in the country. 

The great merit of an Omelette is, that it should not be 
greasy, burnt, nor too much done: if too much of the 
white of the Eggs are left in, no art can prevent its being 
hard, if it is done : to dress the Omelette, the fire should not 
be too hot, as it is an object to have the whole substance 
heated, without much browning the outside. 

One of the great errors in the cooking an Omelette- is that 
it is too thin, consequently instead of feeling full and -moist 
in the mouth, the substance presented is little better than a 



OMELETTES* 397 

piece of fridd leather: to get the Omelette thick is erne of 
the great objects. With respect to the flavours to be intro^ 
duced, these are infinite : that which is most common, how- 
ever, is the best, viz. finely chopped Parsley, and Chives or 
Onions, or EsballotS"- however, one made of a mijttnre of 
Tarragon, Chervil, and Parsley, is a very delicate variety; 
omitting or adding the Onion or Chives. Of the A!leat 
flavours, the Veal Kidney is the most delicate, and is tlte 
most admired by our neighbours the French : this should be 
cut in dice,* and should be dressed (boiled) before it is 
added; in the same manner Ham and Anchovies, shred 
small, or Tongue, will make a veiy delicately flavoured dish. 

The objection to an Omelette is that it is too rich, which 
makes it advisable to eat but a small quantity. An addition 
of some finely mashed Potatoes, about two table-spoonsful 
to an Omelette of six eggs, will much lighten it. 

Omelettes are often served with rich gravy, but, as a 
general principle, no substance which has been fried should 
be served in gravy, but accompanied by it : — or what ought 
to eat dry and crisp, becomes soddened and flat. 

In the compounding the gravy great care should be taken 
that the flavour does not overcome that of the Omelette, a 
thing too little attended to ; a fine gravy, with a flavouring of 
Sweet Herbs and Onions^ we think the best : some add a few 
drops of Tarragon Vinegar ; but this is to be done only with 
great care : gravies to Omelettes are in general thickened : 
this should never be done with flour: Potatoe Starch, or 
Arrow Root, is the best. 

Omelettes should be fried in a small Fryingpan made for 
that purpose, with a small quantity of Butter. The Ome- 
lette's great merit is to be thick, so as not to taste of the out- 
side ; therefore use only half the number of whites that you 
do yolks of Eggs : every care mu§t be taken in frying, even 
at tne risk of not having it quite set in the middle : an Ome- 
lette, which has so much vogue abroad, here is in general a 
thin doubled up piece of leather, and harder than soft leather 
sometimes. The fact is, that as much care must be be- 
stowed on the frying, as should be taken in poaching an 
Egg. A Salamander is necessary to those who will have 
the top brown ; but the kitchen Shovel may be' substituted 
for it.

Five or six £^ will make a good sized Omelette : break 
them into a Basm, and beat them well Mrith a iotk ; and add 
a salt-spoonful of salt ; have ready chopped two drachms of 
Onion, or three drachms of Parsley, a good clove of Eshallot 
minced very fine ; beat it well up with the !Eggs ; then take 
four ounces of fresh Butter, and break half of it into little 
bits, and put it into the Omelette, and the other half into a 
very clean fryingpan ; when it is melted, pour in the Ome- 
lette, and stir it with a spoon till it b^ns to set, then torn it 
up all round the edges, and when it is of a nice brown it is 
done : — the safest way to take it out, is to put a plate on the 
Omelette, and turn the pan upside down ; serve it on. a hot 
dish ; it should never be done till just wanted. If Maigrt^ 
gratrf Cheese, Shrimps, or Oysters. — If Oysters, boil them 
four minutes, and take away the beard and gristly part : they 
may either be put in whole, or cut in bits. 

Or, 

Take Eggs ready boiled hard, and either fry them whole, 
or cut them in half ;— when they are boiled, (they will take 
five minutes), let them lie in cold water till you want to use 
them; then roll them lightly with your baud on a table, and 
they will peel without breaking; put them on a cloth to dry, 
and dredge them lightly wiUi Flour; beat two Eggs in a

Oil or clarified Butter, serve them up with Mushroom Sauce, 
or any other thickened Sauce you please : crisp Parsley is a 
pretty garnish. 

Or, 

Do not boil the Eggs till wanted ; boil them ten minutes, 
peel them as above^ cut them in half, put them on a dish, 
and have ready a Sauce made of two ounces of Butter and 
Flour well rubbed together on a plate, and put it in a stew- 
pan with three quarters of a pint of good Milk ; set it on 
the fire, and stir it^ till it boils ; — ^if it is not quite smooth, 
strain it through a sieve, chop tome Parsley and a clove of 
Eshallot as fine as possible, and put in your Sauce: season 
it with salt to your taste : a little Mace and Lemon peel 
boiled with the Sauce, will improve it : — ^if you like it still 
richer, you may add a little Cream, or the yolks of two Eggs, 
beat up with two table-spoonsful of Milk, and stir it in tbe 
last thing : do not let it boil after : place the half Eggs on a 
dish with the yolks upward, and pour the Sauce over them. 

N. B. Any cold fish cut in pieces may be warmed in 
the above Sauce for a sent Dinner. 

Or, 

Slice very thin two Onions weighing about two ounces 
^ch, put them into a stewpan with three ounces of Butter, 
keep them covered till they are just done, stir them every 
now and then, and when they are of a nice Brown, stir in as 
much Flour as will make them of a stiff paste, then by de- 
grees add as much Water or Milk as will make it the thick- 
ness of good Cream : season it with Pepper and Salt to your 
tarte ; have ready boiled hard four or five Eggs, — ^you may 
either shred them or cut them in halves or quarters, — then 
put them in the Sauce : when they are hot they are ready : 
garnish them with sippets of Bread. 

Or, have ready a plain Omelette, cut into bits, and put 
them into the Sauce.

Bone will require from an hour and a half to two hours ; 
senre fresh toasted Bread with them. 

Eggs fried with Bacon, — (No. 645.) 

. Lay some slices of fine streaked Bacon (not more than a 
quarter of an inch thick) in a clean dish, and toast them be- 
fore the fire in a Cheese«toaster, turning them when the 
upper side is browned — first ask those who are to eat the 
Biiaicon, if they wish it much or little done^ i. e. curled and 
crisped, see- (No. 526), — or mellow and soft (No. 527) ; — 
if the latter, parboil it first. 

Well cleansedy (see No. 83), Dripping^ or Lard, or Fresh 
Butter are the best fats for frying £^. 
. Be sure the fryingpan is quite clean : when the fiit is 
hot, break two or three E^ into it ; do not turn them, but, 
while they are frying, keep pouring some of the fat over 
them witn a spoon : — when the Yolk just begins to look

To Poach Eggs.— (No. 546.) 

The Cook who wishes to display her skill in Poaching, 
must endeavour to procure Eggs that have been laid a couple 
of days, those that are quite new laid are so milky that, take! 
all the care you can, your cooking of them will seldom pro- 
cure you the praise of being a Prime Poiacher ; — you must 
have fresh Eggs, or it is equally impossible. 

The Beauty of a Poached Egg, is for the yolk to be seen 
blushing through the White, — which should only 'be just 
sufficiently hardened, to form a transparent Veil fof the Egg. 

Have some boiling water,* in a Tea Kettle, — pass as 
much of it through a clean cloth as will half till astewpan, 
break the Egg into a cup, and when the water boils, remove 
the stewpan i'rom the stove, and gently slip the ^g into it ; 
it must stand till the white is set ; then put it o?er a very 
moderate fire, and as soon as the water boils, the "Egg is 
ready; take it up with a slice, and neatly round on the 
ragged edges of the white, — ^send them up on Bread toasted 
on one Side only^f with or without Butter ; or without a Toast 
garnished with streaked Bacon (Nos. 526 or 527), nicely 
fried, or as done in (No. 545), or slices of Broiled Beef or 
Mutton (No. 487), Anchovies (Nos. 434 and 435), Pork 
Sausages (No. 87), or Spinage (No. 122.) 

Obs. — The Bread should be a little larger than the Egg, 



* Straining the water is an indispensable precaution, unless you 
•use Spring water.

To boil Eggs to eat in the Shell, or for Salads, 

(No. 547.) 

The fresher laid the better, put them into boiling water ; 
if you like the white just set,* about two minutes boiling is 
enough, a new laid egg will take a little more ; if you wish 
the yolk to be set, it will take three, — and to boil it hard for 
a Salad, ten minutes. See (No. 372.) . 

Obs, — A new laid Egg will require boiling longer than a 
fltale one, by half a minute. 

Tin Machines for boiling Eggs on the Bredkfasl Table, are 
sold by the Ironmongers, which perform the process very 
regularly: — ^in four minutes the white is just set. 
» N.B. ** Eggs may be preserved for Twelve Months, in a 
sweet and palatable state for eating in the shell, or using for 
Salads, by boiling them for one minute ; and when wanted 
for use l^t tliem be boiled in the usual manner : the white 
may be a little tougher than a new laid egg, but the yolk will 
ahow no difference.*' See Hunter's C^ina, page 257. 

Eggs Poached with Sauce of minced Ham. — (No, 548.) 

Poach the Eggs as before directed, and take two or three 
sliced of boiled ham, mince it fine with a gherkin, a morsel 
of onion; a little parsley and pepper and salt; stew all 
together a quarter of an hour; serve up your sauce about 
half boiling ; put the eggs in a dish, squeeze over the juice 
of half a Seville orange, or lemon, and pour the sauce over 
them.

lean ; cm this into vety thin slices, and afterwards into small 
sqimre pieces ; throw them into a stewpan, and set it over a 
gentle fire, that they may lose some of their fat. When as 
much as will freely come is thus melted from them, lay 
them on a warm dish. Put into a stewpan a ladleful of 
melted bacon or lard; set it on a stove; put in about a 
dozen of the small pieces of bacon, then stoop the stewpan 
and break in an egg. Manage this carefully, and the egg 
will presently be done : it will be very round, and the litde 
dice of bacon will stick to it all over, so that it will make a 
very pretty appearance. Take care the yolks do not harden : 
when the egg is thus done, lay it carefully in a warm dish, 
and do the others.

Coffee.* 

Coffee, as used on the Continent, serves the double pur- 
pose of an agreeable tonic, and an exhilarating bc^verage, 
without the unpleasant effects of wine. 

Coffee, as drank in England, debilitates the Stomach, and 
produces a slig^ht nausea. In France and in Italy it is made 
strong from the best Coffee, and is poured out hot and 
transparent. 

In England it is usually made from bad Coffee, served 

out tepid and muddy, and drowned in a deluge of water, 

-and sometimes deserves the title given it in «' the Petition 

against Coffee," 4to, 1674, p. 4, " a base, black, thick^ 

nasty bitter, stinking Puddle Water." 

To make Coffee fit for use, you must employ the German 
filter, — pav at least 4*. the pound for it, — and take at least 
an ounce for two breakfast cups. 

No Coffee will bear drinking with what is called milk in 
London. 

London people should either take their Coffee pure, or 
put a couple of tea-spoonsful of cream to each cup.

and boil it one hour. 

Breid and Butter Pudding. — (No. 557.) 

You must have a dish that .will hold aquart, — wash and pick 
two ounces of currants, strew a few at the bottom of the dish, 
cut about four layers of very thin Bread and Butter, and be- 
tween each layer of Bread and Butter strew some currants, 
then break four 6ggs in a basin, leaving out one white, beat 
them well, and add four ounces of sugar and a drachm of 
nutmeg, stir it well tc^ther with a pint of new milk, pour it 
over about ten minutes before you put it in the oven, — ^itwill 
take three quarters of an hour to bake. 

Pancakes and^Fritters, — (No. 558.) 

Break three Eggs in a Basin, beat them up with a little nut- 
meg and salt, then put to them four ounces and a half of flour 
and a little milk, beat it of a smooth batter, then add by de- 
grees as much milk as- will make it the thickness of good 
cream, — the fryingpan roust be about the size of a pudding 
plate, and very clean, or they will stick, make it hot, and to 
each pancake put in a bit of butter about as big as a walnut ; 
when it is melted, pour in the batter to cover the bottom of 
the pan, make them the thickness of half a crown, fry them 
of a light brown on both sides. 

The above will do for Apple Fritters, by adding one 
spoonful more Flour ; peel your Apples, and cut them in thick 
slices ; take out the core, dip them in the batter and fry 
them in hot lard, — ^put them on a sieve to drain ,^-dish them 
neatly, and grate isome loaf sugar over them.

aDd two tablespoonsful of clarified Soger; let it stand iffe 
(Mr six hours, and it is fit to drink. 

Gourds (now called Vegetable Marrow J Stewed. 

Take off all the skin of six or eight Gourds, put them 
into a stewpan, with water. Salt, Lemon juice, and a bk of 
Butter, or ^t Bacon, and let them stew gently till quite tender, 
and serve up with a rich Dutch sauce, or any other sauce yos 
please that is piqwmte. 

Gourd' Soup 

Should be made of full grown Gourds, but not those that have 
hard skins ; slice three or four, and put them in a stewpan, 
with two or three Onions and a good bit of Butter ; set them 
over a slow fire till quite tender, (be careiul not to let them 
burn,) then add two ounces of crust of Bread and two qoarts 
of good CknuomnUf season with salt and Cayenne pepper, 
boil ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, skim off all the fet, 
and pass it through a tammis, then make it quite hot, and

done, drain them quite dry, beat up an Egs:, and dip .the 
Gourds in it, and cover them well over with Bread-crumbs; 
make some Hog's-lard hot, and fry them a nice light colour, 
throw a little salt and pepper over them, and serve up quite 
dry. 

Another Way. 

Take six or eight small Gourds as near of a size as pos- 
sible, slice them with a Cucumber slice, dry them in a doth, 
and then fry them in very hot lard ; throw over a little pep- 
per and salt, and serve up on a napkin. Great attention i» 
requisite to do these well, — if the fat is quite hot, they are 
done in a minute, and will soon ^il, — if not hot enoi^, 
diey will eat greasy and tough. 

To make Beef, Mutton, or Veal T«a.— (No. 563.) 
Gut > pound of leaa gravy Meat into thin slices, pot it 



MISCELLANEOUS. 415 

iitto^a qtwft and bait a pint of cold water, set it oyer a very 
gentle £re, where it will become gradually warm ; when the 
scum rises, let it , continue simmering gently for about an 
boar, then strain it through a fine sieve, or a napkin, let it 
stand ten minutes to settle, and then pour off the clear Tea. 

N. B. An Onion, and a few grains of Black Pepper, are 
sometimes added. 

If the Meat is boiled till it is thoroughly tender, you may 
miiMie. it and pound it as directed in (Nq< 503,) and make 
Potted Beef. 

To make half a pint, of Beef Tea in five minutes for three 
halfpence, see (No. 252.) 

Mutton Broth for the Sick— (No. 564.) 

Have a pound and a half of a ^eck or Loin of Mutton, 
take off "^e skin and the fat, and put it into a saucepan ; 
cover it with cold water, (it will take about a quart to a^ 
pound of meat,) let it simmer very gently, and skim it wdll ; 
cover it up, and set it over a moderate fire, where it may 
stand gently stewing for about an hour, then strain it off. It. 
should be allowed to become coH when all the greasy pair- 
tides vdll float on the surface, and becoming hard, can be 
easily taken off, and the settlings will remain ait the bottom. 

See also (No. 490,) and (No. 252.) 

N. B* We direct the Meat to be done no more than just 
8iz£6eiently to be eaten, — so a sick man may have plenty of 
good Broth for nothing, as by this manner of producing it 
die meat furnishes also a good family meal. 

Obs. — ^This is an inoffensive nourishment for sick persons 
— «od the only Mutton Broth that should be given to con- 
valescents, whose constitutions require replenishing with re- 
storative aliment of easy digestion. The common way of 
making it with Roots — Onions — Sweet Herbs, &c. &c. is too 
strong for weak Stomachs. Plain Broth will agree with a 
delicate Stomach, when the least addition of other ingredients 
would immediately offend it. 

For the various ways of flavouring Broth, see (No. 527.) 

Few know how much good may be done by such Brodi, 
taken in sufficient quantity at the beginning and decline of 
bowel complaints and fevers,— -half a pint taken at a time.

of Cookery. 

Barley JTcrfcr.— (No. 565.) 

Take a couple of oimces of Pearl Barley, ivask it clean 
with cold water, put it into half a pint of boiling water, and 
let it boil for five minutes ; pour off this water, and add to it 
two quarts of boiling water : boil it to two pints, and strain it 

The above is simple Barley Water ; — to a quart of this is 
frequently added 

Two ounces of Fi^, sliced; 

The same of Raisins, stoned ; 

Half an ounce of Liquorice, sliced and bruised ; 

And a pint of water. 

Boil til] it is reduced to a quart, and strain. 

Oks. — ^These Drinks are intended to assuage thirst id 
ardent Fevers, and inflammatory disorders, for which plenty 
of mild diluting liquor is one of the principal remedies; — 
and if not suggested by the Medical attendant, is frequently 
demanded by honest Instinct, in terms too plain to be mis* 
uilderstood : — ^the Stomach sympathizes wiUi eveiv fibre of 
the human frame, and no part of it can be distressed, without 
in some degree offending the Stomach: — therefore it is of 
the utmost importance to soothe this grand Organ, by ren- 
dering every thing we offer to it as el^nt and agreeable as 
the nature of the case will admit of: — the Barley drink pre- 
pared according to the second receipt, will be received with 
pleasure by the most delicate palate. 

Whey.— (No. 566.) 

Make a pint of Milk boil, — ]^ut to it a glass or two of 
white Wine — ^put it on the fire till it just boils again — then 
set it op one side till the Curd has setUed — pour off the clear 
Whey, and sweeten it as you like. 

Cyder is often substituted for Wine, or half the quantity 
of Vinegar that we have ordered Wine. 

O^...When there is no fire in a sick room, this may be 
put hot into a bottle — and put between the Bed and Mat«» 
tress— it will keep warm several hours.

Toothachey and Anti-rheumatic J&m6rofa^^W.— (No. 567.) 

In no branch of the practice of Physic, is there more 
Dangerous Quackery y than in the dental department. 

To all People, the Toothache is an intolerable Torment 
— not even a Philosopher can endure it patiently — what an 
overcoming ^gony, then, must it be to a Grand Gourmand ! 
— ^besides the mortification of being deprived of the means 
of enjoying that consolation which he looks to as th^ grand 
solace for all sublunary cares. 

When this affliction befalls, him, we recommend the fol^ 
lowing specific for it : — 

R. Sal volatile, three parts. 
Laudanum, one part. 

Mix, and rub the part affected frequently, or if the Tooth 
which aches be hollow, drop some of this on a bit of cotton, 
and put it into the Tooth ; — for a general Faceache, or sore 
Throat, moisten a bit of flannel with it, and put it at night

Savoury Pies, Pasties, and Patties. — (No. 12.) 

The piquance of Pies may be related ad libitum^ by 
sprinkling the articles with Zest (No. 255), Curry Powder 
(No. 455), and see (No. 457 and 459), or by covering the 
bottom of the dish with any of the Forcemeats enumerated 
in (Nos. 373 to 385), and making it into Balls ; lay one rins: 
of uiese and another of hard boiled Eggs, cut in halves, round

Mem. — ^These are dishes contrived rather to excite Appe^

N.B. Large Oysters, parboiled, bearded, and laid alter- 
nately with the Steaks, — ^their liquor reduced and substituted 
iiotead of the Catsup and Wine, will be a variety. 

Chicken Pie.— (No. 16.) 

Parboil and then cut up neatly two Young Chickens— dry 
them — set them over a slow fire for a few minutes— have 
ready some Veal Stuffing or Forcemeat (No. 374 or 375,)

one half pound Citron, one pound of Candied Orange and 
I^mon Peel, cut into thin slices, a large Nutmeg grated, 
half an ounce ground Allspice: ground Cijinamon, Mace, 
Ginger," and Corianders, a quarter of an ounce of each, and 
a gUr of Brandy. 

Put the Butter into a stewpan, in a warm place, and work 
it into a smooth cream with the hand, and mix it with,tbe 
Sugar and Spice in a pan (or on your paste' hoard) for some 
time ; then hreak in tlie Eg^ hy degrees, and heat it at least 
twenty minutes ; — stir in the Brandy, and then the Flour, 
and work it a little — add the Fruit, Sweetmeats, and Al- 
monds, and mix all together lightly, — have ready a hoop 
cased with paper, on a haking plate, — ^put in the mixture, 
smooth it on the top with your hand— dipped milk — put 
the plate on another, with sawdust between, to prevent the 
bottom from colouring too much, — ^bake it in a slow oven* 
four hours or more, and when nearly cold, ice it with 
(No. 84.) 



^ * The goodness of a Cake or Biscuit depends much on its being well 
^aked ; great attention should be paid to the different degrees of beat 
of the oven — be sure to have it of a good sound heat at first, when, after 
its being well cleaned out, may be baked such articles as require a hot 
oven, after which such as are directed to be baked in a well -heated or 
moderate oven, and lastly, those in a slow soaking or cool one. With 
a little care the above degrees may soon be known. 

In making Butter Cakes, such as (Nos. 55, 57, or 0],) too much at- 
'tentioD cannot be paid to have the Butter well creamed, for should it 
be made too warm, it would cause the mixture to be the same, and 
when put to bake, the Fruit, Sweetmeats, <fec., would in that event fall 
to the bottom. 

Yeast Cakes should be well proved before put into the oven, as they will 
prove but little afterwards. 

In making Biscuits and Cakes where Butter is not used, tbedilTerent 
utensils should be kept free from all kinds of Grease, or it is next to im-* 
jNjssible to have good ones. 

In buttering the insides of Cake moulds, the butter should be nicely 
clarified, and when nearly cold, laid on quite smooth, with a small 
brush kept for that purpose. 

Sugar and Floar Should be quite drv» and a drum sieve is recommended 
ifor the Sugar. The old way of beating the yolks and whites of Eggs 
separate (except in very few cases,) is not only useless, but a waste of 
tiine. They should be well incorporated with the other ingredients, and 
in some instances they cannot be beat too much. 



440 PASTRY, &C. lAppenikf 

This mixture would make a haodsome eaice, full twelve 
or»fourteen inches over. 

Obs. — ^If made in cold weather, the ^gs should be broke 
into a pan, and set into another filled with hot water; like* 
wise the fruit, sweetmeats, Almonds, laid in a warm place, 
otherwise it may chill the butter, and cause the cake to be 
heavy.

Milk lukewarm, put it in the hole of the Flour, stir it just to 
make it of a thin Batter, then strew a little Flour over the 
top, — then set it on one side of the fire, and cover it over ; 
let it stand till the next morning:, — then make it into dough ; 
— add half a pint more of warm Milk ; knead it for ten minutes,

OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND PIES. 

The quality of the various Articles employed in the com- 
position of Puddings and Pies varies so much, that two pud- 
dings, made exactly according to the same receipt, will he so 
different* one would hardly suppose they were made hy the 
same person, — and certainly not with precisely the same 
quantities of the (apparently) same Ingredients. Flour 
fresh ground — pure New Milk— Fresh-laid E^gs — Fresh 
Butter — Fresh Suet, &c. will make a very different composi- 
tion, than when kept till each article is half spoiled. 

Plum Puddings^ when hoiled, if hung up in a cool place 
in the cloth they are boiled in, ivill keep good some months : 
when wanted, take them out of the cloth, and put fbem 
mto a clean cloth, and as soon as warmed througli — they 
are ready. 

Mem. — ^In composing these Receipts, the quantities of 
Egos, Butter, &c. are considerably less than is ordered 
in other Cookery Books ; but quite sufficient for the purpose 
of making the puddings light and wholesome, — we have 
diminished the Expense, without impoverishing the prepa- 
rations, and the Rational Epicure, will be as well pleseed 
with them — as the Rational Economist. 

Milk, in its genuine state, varies considerably in the 
quantity of Cream it will throw up,— depending on the 
material with which the Cow is fed. The Cow that gives 
the most Milk does not always produce the most Cream, 
which varies fifteen or twenty per cent. ; this may be imme- 
mediately and accurately ascertained by the Lactometer^ sold 
by Jones, Mathematical Instrument Maker, Charing Cross, 
pcice 2s. 6d. 

In London, the Milk is not only subject to these varia- 

mmt, I . . II. I,., . ■ —I ■ II 111 ■■ I I 1 11 I ■ 

* An old Gentlewomao, who IWed almost entirely on Puddings, told 
us it was a long time before she could get tlieni made uniformlygood— 
till she made the following Rule — '< if the Pudding was good; she let the 
Cook have the remainder of it — if it was not, she gave it to her Lap 
Bog ;*' but as soon as this resolution was Icnovin, poor little Bow Wov 
seldom got the sweet treat after. 



AppendigJ] puddings and pies. 459 

tions ; but is generally not only skimmed^ — ^but thinned with 
Sky-blue (water) from the iTon-tailed Cow, (the pump.) 

London Creamy we are told, is sometimes adulterated with 
Milk, thickened with Fotatoe-starch,. and tinged with Tur- 
meric : — ^this accounts for the Cockneys, on making an expe- 
dition into the country, being so extremely surprised to find 
the thickest part of the Cream — at the Top/ 

Eggs vary considerably in size; in the following Re- 
ceipts we mean the f ulLsized Hen's Egg ; — if you have 
tmly Pullet's Eggs, use two for one. Break Eggs one by 
one into a Basin, and not all into the bowl together, because 
then, if you meet with a bad one, that will spoil all the 
rest : — strain them through a sieve to take out the treddles. 

N. B. To preserve Eggs for twelve months, see N. B. to 
(No. 547). Snow — and Small Bbbr — ^have been re- 
commended by some Economists as admfrable substitutes for 
E^ss : — they will no more answer this purpose than as sub- 
stitutes for Sugar or Brandy, 

Flour, according to that champion i^inst adulteration, 
Mr. Accum, varies m quality as much as any thin^. 

Butter also varies much in quality. SaU Butter may 
be washed firom the Salt, and then it will make very good 
F^ry. 

Labd varies extremely from the time it is kept, &c. 
When you purchase it, have the bladder cut, and ascertain 
that it be sweet and good. 

Suet. Beef is the best — ^then Mutton and Veal .-—when 
this is used in very hot weather, while you chop it, dredge it 
lightly with a little Flour. 

Bbef- Marrow is exceDent for most of the purposes for 
which Suet is employed. 

Drippings, especially from Beef, when very clean and 
nice, are frequency used for Kitchen Crusts and Pies, and 
for such purposes are a satisfactory substitute for Butter^ 
Lard, &c. To clean and preserve Drippings, see (No. 83.) 

Currants, previous to putting them into the Pudding, 
should be plumped ; this is done by pourii^ some boiling 
water upon them :— wash them well, and then lay them on a 
sieve or doth before the fire, — ^pick them clean ficom the

stones ; — ^this not only makes them look better, but cleanses 
them from all dirt 

Raisixs, Figs, Dried Cherries, Candied Orange 
AND Lemon Feel, Citron, and Preserves of all kinds, 
Fresh Fruits, Gooseberries, Currants, Plums, Damsons, 
&c, are added to Batter and Suet Paddings, or enclosed in 
the Crust ordered for Apple Dumplings, and make all the 
various Puddings called by those names. 

Batter Puddings must be quite smooth and free from 
lumps ; to insure this, first mix the Flour with a litde 
Milk — add the remainder by degrees — and then the other 
ingredients. 

If it is a plain Pudding, put it through a hair sieve— this 
will take out all lumps effectually. 

Batter Puddings should be tied up tight : if boiled ii 
a mould, butter it first — if baked, also butter the P^. 

Be sure the water boils before you put in the Pudding. 
' — set your stewpan 6n a trivet over the fire, and keep it 
Steadily boilipg al) the time — if set upon the fire the Pudding 
often bums. 

Be scrupulously careful that your Pudding Cloth is per- 
fectly sweet and clean, wash it without any Soap — ^unless 
very greasy — ^then rince it thoroughly in clean water afto*. 
Immediately before you use it dip it in Boiling- Water, 
squeeze it dry, and dredge it with Flour. 

If your fire is very fierce, mind and stir the Puddings 
ever}- now and then, to keep them from sticking to the bot- 
tom of the saucepan ; if in a Mould this care is not so much 
required, but keep plenty of water in the saucepan. 

When Puddings are boiled in a doth, it should be just 
dipped in a Basin of cold water, before you untie the 
Pudding Cloth, as that will prevent it from sticking; but 
when boiled in a Mould, if it is well buttered, they will turn 
out without. Custard or Bread Puddings require to stand fifc 
minutes before they are turned out. They should always be 
boiled in a Mould or Cups. 

Keep your Paste-board, Rolling-pin, Cutters, and Tins 
very cleans— the least dust on the Tins and Cutters, or the least 
hard Paste on the Rolling-pin, will spoil the whole of you? 
Jabovur,

Things used fot Pastry or Cakes should not be used foi* 
any other purpose : be very careful that your Flour is dried 
before the fire, before you use it, for Puff Paste or Cakes ; if 
damp, it will make it heavy. 

In using Butter for Piiff' Paste, you should take the 
greatest care to previously work it well on the Paeteboard or 
Slals to get out all the water and butter-milk, which very 
often remains in ; — when you have worked it well with ^ 
dean knife, dab it over with a soft cloth, and it is then ready 
to lay on your Paste : do not make your Paste over stiff be- 
fore you put in your Butter. 

For those who do not understand making Puff Paste, it 
is by far the best way to work the Butter in at two separate 
times-^divide it in half — and break the half in little bits^ 
and cover your Paste all over, dredge it lightly with Flour 
— ^then fold it over each side and ends, roll it out quite thin, 
and then put in the rest of the Butter — fold it, and roll it 
again. Remember always to roll Puff Paste from you. The 
best made Paste, if not properly baked, will not do the Cook 
any credit. 

Those who use Iron "Overu do not always succeed in 
baking Puff Paste, Fruit Pies, &c. — ^Puff Paste is often 
spoiled by baking it after Fruit Pies, in an iron oven. This 
may be easily avoided by putting two or three bricks that 
are quite even into the oven before it is first set to get hot. 
This will not only prevent the syrup from boiling out of the 
Pies — ^but also prevent a very disagreeable smell in the 
kitchen and house — and almost answer the same purpose as 
a brick oven. 

College PiLddings.—(^o. 105.) 

Beat four Eggs, yolks and whites together, in a a quart 
basin, with two ounces of Flour, half a Nutmeg, a little 
Ginger, and three ounces of Sugar — pounded Loaf Sugar 
is best. Beat it into a smooth batter ; then add six ounces 
of Suet chopped fine, six of Currants well washed and 
picked; mix it all well together — a glass of Brandy or 
While Wine will improve it. These Puddings are generally 
fried in Butter or Lard ; but they are much nicer baked in 
an oven in patty pans : twenty minutes will bake them — 
if fried, fiy them till they are' of a nice light brown, and 



462 pmiDlNGS AKO PiBS. [Jppendk. 

when fried, roll them in a little Flour. You may add one 
ounce of Orange or Citron minced very fine ; when yon 
bake them» add one more E^, or two spoonsful of Milk. 
Serve them up with White Wme Sauce. 

JRtc6 Puddings Bahed-^^ Boiled.— (So. 106.) 

Wash in cold water and pick very clean six ounces of Rice^ 
put it in a quart stewpan three parts filled with cold water, 
set it on the fire, let it boil five minnte&^pour away the 
water, and put in one quart of Milk, a roll of Lemon Peel, 
and a bit of Cinnamon ; let it boil gently till the Rice is 
quite tender, it will take at least one hour and a quarter, be 
careful to stir it every five minutes, take it off the fire, and 
stir in an ounce and a half of Fresh Butter, and beat up three 
Eg^s on a plate, a salt-spooofu! of Nutmeg, two ounces of 
Susar^ put it into the Pudding, and stir it till it is quite smooth 
•—Tine a pie-dish bis( enough to hold it with Puff Paste, notcfk 
it round the«dge, put in your Pudding, and bake it three qwh 
ten of an hour : this will be a nice firm Pudding* 

If you like it to eat more like Custard, add one more Eg^, 
and a half pint more milk ; it will be better a little thinner 
when boiled ; one hour will boil it. If you like it in fittle 
Puddings, butter small tea-K^ups, and either bake or boil 
them, half an hour will do either; you may vary the Pad- 
ding by putting in Candied Lemon or Orange Peel, minced 
very fine— or dried Cherritw,— K)r three ounces of CurrcaUSi 
««-or fiatniM,—- <Hr Apples minced fine. 

If the Puddings are baked or boiled, serve them w'.th White 
Wine Sauce, or Butter and Sugar. 

Ground Rice Pudding, — (No. 107.) 

Put four ounces of ground Rice into a stewpan, and by de- 
grees stir in a pint and a half of Milk, set it on the fire, with 
a roll of Lemon and a bit of Cinnamon, keep stirring it till 
it boils— beat it to a smooth Baiter — ^then set it on the trivet, 
where it will simmer gently for a quarter of an hour ; — then 
"beat three Esrgs on a plate, stir them into the Pudding with 
two ounces of Sugar, and two drams of Nutmeg — take out 
the Lemon Peel and Cinnamon — stir it all well together, line 
a pie dish with thin Puff paste, (No. 1 of Receipts for Pas- 
try,) big enough to hold it, or Butter the Dish well, and bake 



appendix,] promNas and pibs. 463 

it half an hoar — ^if hoiled, it wiH take one hour m a mould 
well buttered — ^three ounces of Currants may be added. 

Rice Snow BaZ&.— (No. 108.) 

Wash and pick half a ponnd of Rice very clean, put it on 
in fl saucepan with plenty of water ; wh«i it boils let it boil 
ten minutes, drain it on a sieve till it is quite dry, and then 
-pare six apples, weighing two ovoicesandahalf each. Divide 
the Rice into six parcels, in separate cloth»— put one apple 
in each — ^tie it loose, and boil it one hour-^-^erve it with 
Sugar and Butter, or wine sauce. 

Rioe B/oncmanpe.— *(No. 109.) 

Pot a tea-copful of whole Rice, into the least water pos- 
sible, till it almost bursts: then add half a- pint of good Milk 
or thin Cream, and boil it till it is quite a mash, stirring it 
the whole time it is on the fire, that it may not bum : dip a 
shape in cold water, aud do not dr^ it, put in the rice, and 
let It stand until quite cold, when it will come easily out of 
the shape. This dish is much approved of; it is eaten with 
cr^am or custard, and preserved fruits^^raspberries are best. 
It should be made the day before it is wanted, that it may get 
firm. 

This Blancmange will eat much nicer, flavoured with Spices^ 
Lemon t^eel, &c. and sweetened with a little Loaf Sugar, add 
it with the BAilk, and take out the Lemon Peel before you put 
in the mould. 

5are-a2/ PiM2tffR9;-^(No. 110.) 

Put any scraps of Bread into a clean saucepan, — ^to about 
a pound, put a pint of Milk ; set it on the trivet till it boils, 
beat it up quite smooth, then break in three Eggs, three 
oxmces of Sugar, with a little Nutmeg, Ginger, or Allspice, 
and stir it all well together. Butter a Dish big enough to holdf 
it, put in the pudding, and have ready two oimces of suet 
chopped very fine, strew it over the top of the pudding, and 
bake it three quarters of an hour : four ounces of Currants 
wift make it much better. 

BaUer Pudding^ Baked or Boiled, — (No. 111.) 

Break three Eggs in a basin with as much salt as will lie 



464 PIJDDINQS AND piBK [Appendix. 

ob a sixpence, beat them well together, and then add four 
ounces of Flour — ^beat it into a smooth Batter, and by degrees 
add half a pint of Milk : have your saucepan ready boiling, 
and butter an earthen mould well, put the pudding in, and 
tie it tight over with a pudding cloth, and ooil it one hour 
and a quarter. Or put it in a dish that you have well but- 
tered, and bake it three quarters of an hotir. 

Currants wtished and picked clean, or Raisins stoned, are 
good in this pudding, and it is then called a Bladt Cap : or, 
add Loaf Sugar, and a little Nutmeg and Gin^r without the 
fruit, it is very good that way, — serve it with Wine sauce. 

Jpple Piuddng Bot/ed— (No. 112.) 

Chop four ounces of Beef Suet very fin^, or two ounces of 
Butter, Lard, or Dripping — but the suet makes the best and 
lightest crust ; put it on the paste board, with eight ounces 
of flour, and a salt-spoonful of salt^ mix it well together with 
your hands, and then put it aH of a heap, and make a hole in 
the middle ; break one egg in it, stir it well together with 
your finger, and by de^grees infuse as much water as will 
make it of a sti£f pate :— roll it out two or three times with 
the rolling-pin, and then roll it large enough to receive thir- 
teen ounces of Apples. It will look neater if boiled in a basin, 
well buttered, tnan when boiled in a pudding cloth well 
floured: boil it an hour and three quartersj'^but the surest 
way is to stew the apples first in a stewpan^ with a wine- 
glassful of water, and then one hour will boil it. Some people 
ike it flavoured with Cloves and Lemon Peel, and sweeten it 
with two ounces of Sugar. 

Gooseberries, Currants, and Raspberries, CHKit- 
RiEs, Damsons, and various Plums and Fruits, are 
made into Puddings with the same Crust directed for Apple 
Puddings. 

Apple Dumplings.'^-^ (No. 113.) 

Make Paste the same as ifor Apple Pudding, divide it into 
as many pieces as you want Dumplings, peel the apples and 
core them, then roll out your paste large enough, and put in 
the apples ; close it al) round, and tie them in pudding cloths 



Appendix.] puddings and pies. 465 

very tight,— one hour will boil them — and when you take 
them up. Just dip them in cold water, and put them in a cup 
the size of the dumpling while you untie them, and they will 
turn out without breaking. 

StLct Pudding or Dumplings. — (No. 1 14.) 

Chop six ounces of Suet very fine»<^put it in a basin with 
six ounces of Flour, two ounces of Bread crumbs, and a tea- 
spoonful of Salt — stir it all well together ; — ^beat two eggs on 
a plate, add to them six table*spoonsful of milk, put it by 
degrees into the basin, and stir it all well together ; divide 
it into six dumplings, and tie them separate, previously 
dredging the cloth lightly with flour. 

Boil them one hour. 

This is very good the next day fried in a little butter. The 
above will make a good puddings boiled in ^n earthenware 
mould, with the addition of one Haore e^, a httlemore milk, 
and two ounces of suet^ '- 

Boil it two hours. 

N 6. The most EconomiccU way of making Suet Dump^ 
UngSf is to boil them without a cloth in a pot with Beef— or 
Mutton — no Eggs are then wanted^ and the dumplings are 

Suite as lieht without : Roll them in flour before you put 
lem into uie pot ; add six ounces of Currants, washed and 
picked^ and you have Currant Pudding— ox divided into six 
parts, Cwrrant Dumplings^ — a little sugar will improve 
them. 

Cottage Potatoe Pudding or Cake, — (No. 115.) 

Peel, boil, and mash, a coupk of pomids of Potatoes ; beat 
them up into a smooth batter, ^ith about three quarters of a 
pint of Milk, two ounces of moist Sugar, and two or three 
oeaten Eggs. 

Bake it about three quarters of an hour. 

Threetmnces of Currants or Raisins may be added. 

Leave out the Milk, and add three ounces of Butter, it 
will make a very nice Cake*

OBSERVATIONS ON WCKLES. 

Wk are not fond of Pickles, — these Sponges of Vinegar 
are often very Indigestible, especially in the crisp state in 
which they are most admired. The Indian Fashion of 
pounding Pickles is an excellent one, — We recommend those 
who have any regard for tlieir Stomach, yet still wish to in- 
dulge their Ton^rue,'— instead of eating Pickles, which are 
leaUy merely vehicles for taking a certain portion of Vinegar 
and Spice, &c«, to use the Flavoured Vinegars^ su(^ as Buu 
net (No, 399,) Horseradish (No. 399*), Tarfagon (No. 396,) 
Mint (No. 397,) Cress (Nos. 397*, 401, 403, 405*, 453, 
457,) &c. ; by combinations of these, a relish may easily be 
composed, exactly in harmo^ with the palate of the eater. 

The Hchie made to preserve Cucwnoers, ^c. is generally 
so strongly impregnated with Garlick, Mustard and Spice, 
&c. that the original flavour of the V^etables is quite over- 
powered ; and if the eater shuts his Eves, his Lingnal nerves 
will be puzaded to inform him whether he is munching an 
Onion or a Cocumber, &c», and nothing can be more 
absurd, than to pickle I^ums, Peaches, Apricots, Currants, 
Grapes, &c. \ 

.The Stroiigest Vinegar must he used for Pidding>^it 
must not be boiled, (or the strength of the Vinegar and 
Spices will be evaporated.) — ^By parboiling the Pickles in 
brine, they will be ready in much less time than they are 
when done in the usual u.anner, of soaking them in ooldsak 
and water for six or eight days. — When taken out of the bot 
brine« let them get cold, and quite dry before you put them 
into the Pickle. 

To assist the preservation of Pickles, a portion of Salt is 
added, and for the same purpose, and to give flavour, — 
Long Pepper, — Black Pepper,— AlWpice,—Gingeir, — Cloves, 
Mace, — ^Garlick, — Shallots, •^Mustiurd, —Horseradish, — and 
Capsicum. 

The following is the best method of preparihg the Kckle, 
-—as cheap as any,— and requires less care than any other 
way. 

Bruise in a mortar four ounces of the above Spices; — ^put 



them inte a stone jar wilb a quart of the strongest Vinegar, 
stop the jar closely with a bung,— cover that with a Wackier 
soaked with Pickle, set it on- a trivet by the side of the fire 
for three daysy well shaking it up at least thsee times in the 
day, the pickle should be at least three inches aoove the 
Pickles* — Tlie Jar being well doaedi and the infusion being 
made with a mild heat^ there is no hss by evaporation* 

To enable the articles yielded to more easily and speedily 
isabibe the flavour of the Pickle they are immersed in, pre- 
i^iousiy to pouring it on them — run a larding, pin through 
them in several places. 

The Spices^ &c. commonly used, are those mentioned in 
the Receipt Jbr nickUjig Walnuts^ which is also an excellent 
JSiakvomry 8auce tor cold meats. 

The flavour may be varied ad infinitum^ by adding Celery^ 
Creas Seed, or Curry Powder,. (No. 455,) or by taking for 
the Liquor any of the flavoured Vinegars, &c. we have 
enumerated above, and see the receipts between (Nos. 395 
and 421.) 

Pidtles should be kept in a dry place, in unglazed Earthen- 
ivace, or GUiss Jars^ which are prefersSble, as you caff^ 
without opening them» observe whether they want filling up: 
they must be very carefully stopped with well fitting Bungs, 
and tied over as closely a» possible with a bladder wetted with 
the Piokle ; and if to be preserved a long time, after that it 
iryi itmnsA be dipped in* Bottle Cement, see page 122* 

When the Picldee- are all used, boil up the tiquor with a 
litde fresh spi€e« 

To W(aln»i4 Liquor may be: added a few Anchovies and 
Ethallots: let it stand till it is q^ite clear., and bottle it: 
thus* 3rou may furnish your table with aa excellent savoury^ 
keeping sauee for Hashes, Made Dishes^ Fish, &c» at veiy 
small cost, see (No. 439.) 

Jars should not be> move thod three parta filled, with the 
aKtides pickled, which sfaoidd bfrcovered w^th Pickle at least 
two inciies above their sui^e; — ^the liquor wastes, and all 
of the articles pickled, that are not covered, are soon spoiled. 

When they have been ^one about a' week, open the Jars, 
and fiH^em up with Pickk.

468 PICKLES. [Appendix 

• Tie a wooden spoon, full of holes^ round each jar to ts^ 
them out with. 

If you wish to have Ghevinns^ &b. very Cfreen^ this may 
be easily accomplished by keeping them in Vihiegar, suffi- 
ciently hot, till they become so. 

If you wish Catdiflovoert, Ontoiu, &c. to be JFhiiey use 
distilled Vinegar for thekik. 

To entirely prevent the mischief arising from the action 
of the Acid upon the metallic utensils usually employed to 
prepare Pickle, the whole of the process is directed to be 
performed in unglazed Stone Jars. 

N. B. The maxim of " Open your Mouthy and shut your 
EyeSy^ cannot be better Applied than to Pickles ; and the 
only direction we have to record for the improvement of their 
complexion, is the joke of Dr. Goldsmith, — *• If their colour 
does not please you, send 'em to HamrMTsmthy — tteit's 
the way to Turnkam Green.^* 

Gherkins. — (No. 1 1 6.) 

Get those of about four inches long and an inch diameter, 
the crude half grown little Gherkins usually pickled are good 
for nothing. — Put them into (unglazed) Stone pans, cover 
them with a brine of salt and water, made with a quarter of 
A pound of salt to a quart of water, cover them down^ set 
Aem on the hearth be lore the fire for two or three days tiD 
they begin to turn yellow ; then put away the water, and 
cover them with hot Vinegar, set them again before the fire, 
keep them hot till they become Green, (this will take eight 
6r ten days,) then pour Off the Vinegar, — having ready to 
cover them a Pickle of fresh Vinegar, &c. the same as di- 
rected in the following receipt fot* Walnuts (leaving out the 
Shallots,) cover them with a bung^ bladder, and leather.

quarter of a pound of Salt to a qtiart of Water — put the Wal- 
nuts into this to soak for a week-^r if you wish to soften 
them so that they may he soon ready for eaJting — ^run a lard- 
ing Pin through th^m in half a doizen places — ^this will allow 
the Pickle to penetrate, and they will be much softer, and of 
better flavour, land ready much sooner 'than if not perforated ; 
—put them into a stewpin with such brine, and give them a 
gentle simmer — put them on a sieve to drain — ^then lay 
them on a fish plate, and let them stand in the air till they 
turn black — ^this may take a coUple of days — put them into 
Glass, Or tnglaz6d Stone Jars — ^fili these about three part^ 
with the Walnuts, and fill them . up with the following 
Pickle. 

To each quart of the strongest Vinegar put two ounces of 
Black Pepper, one of Ginger, same of Shallots, same of Salt, 
half an oimce of Allspice, and half a drachm of Cayenne. 
Put these into a stone jar, cover it with a bladder, wetted 
with the pickle — tie over that some leather, and set the Jar 
on a trivet, by the side of the fire, lor three days, shaking it 
up three times a day, and then pour it while hot to the Wal- 
nuts, and cover them down with Bladder, wetted with the 
Piclde, leather, &c. 

FRENCH Beans — Nasturtiums, &c. — (No. 118^ 



When young,— -and most other small green Vegetables, 
may be pickled the same way as Gherkins. 

Beef Roots* — (No. 119.) 

Boil gently till they are full three parts done (this will tdke 
from an hour and a half to two and a half,) then take them 
out, and when a little cooled, peel them^ and cut them in 
slices about half an inch thick. Have ready a pickle for it; 
m^de by adding to each quart of Vinegar, an ounce of ground 
Black Pepper, half -an ounce of Gmger pounded, same of Salt, 
and of Horseradish cut in thin slices, and you may warm it> 
if you like, with a few Capsicums, or a littkfl^enne; — 
put these ingredients into a Jar, stop it close, afla let them

quarter it — ^take out the stalk — shred the leaves into a cul- 
lender — sprinkle them with salt — let them remain till the 
morrow — drain them dry — put them into a Jar, and cover 
ihem with the pickle ordered for Befit Roots. 

Onions.- (Na 121.) 

The small round silver button Onions, about as big as" a 
Nutmeg, make a very nice Pickle.— Take off their top coats, 
•^ave ready a stewpan, three parts filled with boiHng water, 
into which put as many Onions as will cover the top; aa 
Boon as they look clear, immediately take them up witb a 
spoon full of holes, and lay them on a cloth three times 
folded, and cover them with another tiM you have readv as 
many as you wish : when they are quite dry, put them mto 
jars, and cover them with hot Pickle, made by infusing an 
ounce of Horseradish, same of Allspice, and same of Black 
Pepper, and same of Salt, in a quart of best White Wine 
Vinegar, in a stone jar, on a trivet by the side of the fire for 
three days, keeping it well closed ; — ^when cjld, bung them 
down tight, and cover th\?m with bladder wetted with the 
pickle, and leather. 

Cauliflowers OR 6rocou.-^(No. 122.)

Nasturtiums are excellent prepared a^ abiove. 

li^DiAN OR Mixed Pickle — Mango or Piccalflli. — 

(No. 123.) 

The flavouring ingredients of Indian Pickles are a com- 
pound of Curry Powder^ with a large proportion of Mustard 
and Gurlick. 

The following will he found something like the real Mango 
Pickle, especially if the Garlick be used plentifully. To each 
gallon of the strongest Vinegar put four ounces of Curry 
Powder (No. 455,) same of Flour of Mustard, (some rub 
these together, with half a pint of Salad Oil,) three of Ginger 
bruised — and two of Turmeric, half a pound (when skinned) 
of Shallots, (slightly baked in a Dutch oven,) two ounces of 
Garlick, prepared in like manner, a quarter of a pound of 
Salt, and two drachms of Cayenne Pepper. 

Put these ingredients into a stone jar, cover it with a 
bladder wetted with the pickle, and set it on a trivet by the 
side of the fire during three days, shaking it up three times a 
day — it will then be ready to receive Gherkins — sliced Cu- 
cumbers — sliced Onions — ^Button Onions — Cauliflowers — 
Celery — Brocoli — French Beans — ^Nasturtiums — Capsicums, 
and small green Melons. The latter must be slit in the 
middle sufficiently to admit a marrow spoon, with which 
take out all the seeds — then parboil the melons in a brine 
that will bear an e^, dry them, and fill them with Mustard 
Seed. and two Cloves of Garlick, and bind the Melon roimd 
with packthread. 

Large Cucumbers may be prepared in like manner. 

Green Peaches make the best imitation of the Indian 
Manpo. 

The other articles are to be separately parboiled (ex* 
€epting the Capsicums) in a brine of Salt and Water- strong 
enough to bear an egg— taken out and drained — and spread 
out and thoroughly dried in the ^xm—omgk stove — or 
before a fire, for a couple of day8> and then put into the 
Pickle. 



472 PICKLES. [Appendk. 

Any thing may be put into this Pickle, except Red Cab- 
bafi« and Wahiuts. 

It will keep several years. 

Obs. — ^To THE Indian Mango Pickle is added a con- 
siderable qtiantity of Mustard Seed OU — wbich would also 
be an excellent warm ingredient in our Salad Sauces.

FAREWELL TO THE READER. 



^K now have made, in one design, 
Ik Utile and Dulee join, 
ftd taaght the poor, and men of wealth, 
reconcile their tastes to Health, 
estrain each forward appetite, 
dine with prudence and delight, 
nd earefol all onr rales to follow, 
9 masticate before they swallow. 
is thus Htobia guides oar pen, 
» warn the greedy sons of men, 
» moderate their wine and meat. 
Id ** eat to live, not live to eat." 
NT the rash Palate oft bestows 
tfaritic Lteetures on the Toes ! ! f 
»e Siomaeh^Yoid of wind and bile, 
All praise our monitory style, 
Id as he cannot speak, enlist 
Biself as your ventriloquist — 
ie Head, now clear from pain and vapour, 
lall order out his ink and paper ; 
id dictate praises on the»e rules, 
• govern gormandising fools. 
e Legg, now fearless of the gout, 
ready messengers turn eat. 



To spread our volume far and near. 
Active in gratitude sincere. 
While thus the Bodjf, strong and sound. 
Our constant advocate is found, 
And pointing to receipts delicious, 
Bxclaims •• who reads our new Apkcivs, 
If he has brains may keep them cool, 
If a sound stomach and no fool. 
May keep it so, uoclogged by food. 
Indigestion's sickly brood. 
His Hunger, though oppressive, ease, 
His Palate, though capricious, pleawe. 

And if with care he reads our Booh, 

In theory may be a Cook; 

Learn the delights good rules proease us 

When appetite by reason's aw'd, 

(Zbno alike and Epicuacs 

Pleasures combin'd with health applaudj 

He who is Stomach's master, be 

The noblest Empire then may boast. 

And at whatever Feast he be. 

That man alone ' shall rule the Roast.' "
