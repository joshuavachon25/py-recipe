PKEFACE. 



The success of " Ten Dollars Enough," as it appeared 
serially in the pages of " Good Housekeeping," and the 
numerous letters received by the editor of that magazine 
asking for it in more convenient shape, has led to its 
publication in its present form. 

It is very pleasant to learn from these same letters 
that the writers have tried Molly's recipes with such 
success, there being, I am assured by the same gentle- 
man, but two exceptions (and one of these candidly says 
the fault might be her own) among the large number 
who expressed satisfaction. 

This testimony is especially gratifying, showing, as it 
does, how earnest and faithful my readers have been; 
for, although the directions were minutely given and 
every effort made to meet difficulties, all my care would 
not have sufficed to produce success, had there not been 
faithful cooperation on the part of those who followed 
them. I take this opportunity to make clear two mat- 
ters which, I found early in the course of the story, were 
lost sight of by two or three readers, perhaps others. 

I allude to the prices of provisions and the amount of 
cooking accomplished in a given time. 

To those who questioned the cost of articles I would 
say : they forgot, reading in December, when they were 
doubtless paying higher prices, that the prices quoted 
were for September, To another who quotes the high

price she has to pay for certain things, I only say : 
Molly was keeping house with some luxury, on the 
same amount of table-mouey as many require to live 
very plainly. This could not be done except by buying 
everything only in its season ; if beyond a certain price, 
she waited for it to get lower. 

This brings me to what is after all the gist of the 
matter. " Ten Dollars Enough " was intended for read- 
ers in widely different parts of the country. It would 
have readers where the meat and poultry prices would 
seem very high, and the groceries equally low. I there- 
fore decided to take average New York retail prices 
and not to go below them. 

There may be cities and suburbs where the prices are 
higher than in New York, but in my experience these 
are few compared with the many where they are lower. 

As to the question of time, Molly is not represented 
as an inexperienced young wife, but as a graduate of 
cooking-schools, who could herself have joined the 
corps of culinary teachers had it been necessary. 

Her expertness had not come without many failures, 
and the readers of " Ten Dollars Enough " were in- 
vited to profit by the finished result of her failures and 
experiments. Because she had often fail>ed before she 
succeeded, she was able to avert failure from Marta or 
others. 

Bearing in mind, then, that Molly knew precisely 
what to do and how to do it, it will be readily seen that 
her most elaborate dinner was very simple indeed, com- 
pared with the menu prepared by one lady and her as- 
sistant at any first-rate cooking demonstration, in the 
same space of time.

TEN" DOLLAES ENOUGH, 



CHAPTER I. 

MR. AND MRS. BISHOP TRY THE EXPERIMEIH?. 

*' Beef steak, cod steak, mutton chop, and hash ! " 

This bill of fare, glibly rattled off by a neat waitress, 
promised a very satisfying breakfast, supplemented as it 
was by abundant cream-of-tartar biscuit and potatoes. 
Yet Mrs. Bishop thought this morning, as she had done 
for three hundred out of the three hundred and sixty-five 
mornings she had heard it, she would gladly have 
exchanged all for a cup of really fine coffee, a fresh 
egg, and some good home-made bread and butter. Need- 
less to say, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop were boarding, and do- 
ing so at a very good house, for the money they were 
able to pay, — $20 per week for the two. Yet to this 
couple, reared with luxury and refinement, the very 
abundance was nauseating. 

" You ate no breakfast again, Puss. What am I to do 
with you ? " 

" Oh, I shall do very well. I am sure one has nothing 
to complain of, and if Mrs. Jones were to cater to our 
tastes she would not satisfy her other boarders." 

" Yes, there is a coarse substantial abundance about it, 
that always strikes me with wonder as to how it is done 
for the money " — 

"And yet, Harry, wouldn't you enjoy a nice little 
brealiast for our two selves ? Oh, if we could only keep 
house ' " 

"Mv darling, I wish to keep house just as much as 



2 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

you do, but with my income such housekeeping would 
be very diti'erent from what you think. You would have 
to limit the clean table-cloths and napkins, and stint 
yourself in everything, to make both ends meet." 

" I wish I could convince you, Harry, that it need 
not be so. You don't know what a good manager I 
should be." 

" Dear little woman, I could n't have you make a 
drudge of yourself, and believe me, you don't realize the 
dilierence between practice and theory. I know several 
men who have good, self-denying wives, and just my in- 
come, but I could not look forward to the narrowness of 
such houses as theirs, nor wish to see you in one. While 
we are boarding we can't pretend to have a home ; there 
is no temptation to ask a friend to a meal, no shame if 
one comes and it is n't good." 

Mrs. Bi>hop turned a smiling face on her husband. 

" That is the secret, Harry. You are afraid of being 
ashamed of my housekeeping. Shall I promise you 
that you shall never dread to bring a friend home for 
fear of a soiled table-cloth, and a too economical din- 
ner? I assure you I haven't been to cooking-schools for 
nothing." 

" You dear enthusiast ! If it were not for your own 
sake I 'd let you try." 

Mrs. Bishop executed a little dance of joy. 

" Oh, Harry, you can't go back on that, you must n't ! 
Do let us go through this winter in our own house." 

Mr. Bishop only said, taking out his watch — 

" By Jove ! I have only time to catch the car. Good- 
bye, dear." Pressing a hearty kiss on her soft cheek, 
he rushed down the stairs and out of the house. 

There was quite a little romance about this young 
couple, which I will relate here, that those who may 
follow the young wife's trials and triumphs may under- 
stand some that she had to fear. Harry Bishop was the 
son of a prosperous merchant, who, as is the fashijon in 
this America of ours, lived almost like a prince wn the 
profits of his business, but, as his family was large, and

his wife ambitious and extravagant, it was not very cer- 
tain that he would be able to provide a fortune for each 
of his children. For this reason he and Mrs. Bishop 
were anxious that tliose children should marry money. 

When Harry declared his intention of marrying, in- 
stead of the rich Miss Vanderpool his mother had looked 
out for him, pretty, penniless Molly Marsh, the anger 
and disappointment at home had been very great, and al- 
though it is not the fashion in this country to cast of? the 
sons and daughters who make rash marriages, they did 
the next thing to it, — they disapproved so strongly that 
Molly rarely visited the grand home Harry had given up 
to marry her, and Harry's father in his anger had said : 

'* Do you remember, sir, that your paltry salary would 
n't pay the rent of a house in a decent location ? and 
you propose to keep a wife on it ! One thing you may 
be sure, 'as you make your bed so you must lie,' and 
when you have a mass of unpaid bills, you mustn't look 
to me to pay 'em." 

"I never will, sir. lam sorry for Molly's sake you 
take it like this, but I hope in time you will see that 
I am right to choose happiness instead of riches." 

And then Harry's mother had pictured the sordid 
home kept on $100 a month, and derisively asked if he 
supposed he would be happy after the honeymoon was 
over, eating common coarse food in a shabby little din- 
ing-room. 

" The idea of it ! You are the last person, Harry, to 
content yourself in that way. Why, you criticise even 
my cook ; how will you do with no cook at all ? " 

" I should n't criticise, dear mother, if you did the 
cooking." 

They had been married a year now, and Molly and 
Harry paid rare visits to his father's house, and she, 
poor young wife, was made to feel how much her hus- 
band had sacrificed for her, and she knew, good as Harry 
was, he would be rather exacting in his own home; 
that, though for love of her he might not express him- 
self, small deJScieneies would jar on him, and that in be» 



4 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

ginning to keep house she would be undertaking a great 
deal. 

" But that will be my share. If by devoting time 
to my housekeeping, I can make Harry's money go half 
as far again as it would otherwise do, I shall do as much 
as if I earned half as much as he." 

And so during that year of boarding and leisure, 
Molly had attended cooking-classes, with a married 
friend, and had gone home with her and they had prac- 
ticed together. She had read, too, everything she could 
find about housekeeping, and Harry laughed, sometimes, 
till the tears ran down his cheeks at what he called her 
"paper housekeeping." 

Yet her pictures of that ideal home they were to 
have were very alluring to him too, and this particular 
morning, when their boarding-house life had lasted just 
one year, her words had taken deeper hold than ever 
before. That evening he returned with a very mysteri- 
ous look on his face. 

" What is the matter, Harry ? " asked Molly, merrily. 
'^ What plot are you brewing ? " 

" How would you like to pass a winter in the coun- 
try?" 

" I should n't mind. Why do you ask ? " 

" Because we can put your longed-for experiment to 
the test. John Win field is going to take his wife to 
Europe on the first of September, and wants to let his 
cottage furnished for the bare rent he pays: $20 per 
month." 

" Oh, Harry ! and we will take it? It is such a cozy 
little place." 

" Yes, dear, I think we may venture on this experi- 
ment. If it happens that we tire of housekeeping in a 
few months, we shall not be burdened with furniture 
that we don't want, and if you are as happy as you think, 
we can take a little house and furnish it." 

Mrs. Bishop looked the joy she felt, and all that 
evening they were discussing plans and prospects. 

Many of my readers will wonder, perhaps, why this 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 5 

young couple looked upon beginning housekeeping on 
Harry's income as such a tremendous experiment, when 
so many live and bring up families on much less. But 
there was no disguising the fact that Harry's bringing- 
up in his father's luxurious house had made him fastidi- 
ous, and he shrank from the too frugal table that he as- 
sociated with such means, and, even more, the necessity 
of foregoing in his own house the refinement he had 
been accustomed to. This lack being in the house of 
another person irked him less. 

Molly's dread was mixed with a trembling desire to 
show her husband what sort of a wife he had married. 

"I feel just a doll while boarding, with nothing to 
think of but my clothes. You don't know whether I am 
fit to be a helpmeet or not," she had often said, and he 
had replied, " My darling, I take it all on faith ; you 
are too good for me, even if you could not sew on a but- 
ton." 

But Molly's trembling did not come from fear of fac- 
ing life in a cottage. She knew herself, but she did 
think that Harry might grow to repent the step. She 
feared also the criticism of his mother, ever watchful for 
a trip on her part. 

Ah ! what agony it would be to her, if her husband 
should ever regret the sacrifice he had made ! But from 
such thoughts as these, that kept her awake far into the 
night while Harry slept soundly at her side, she would 
turn to a vision of herself as a triumphant little matron. 

" I cannot fail ! My time and ingenuity will certainly 
supply the deficiency of money." 

Molly had kept house for an invalid mother, who, for 
economy's sake, had lived in a small French town, and 
after her mother's death she had found herself forced to 
earn her living as governess, for her mother's income 
died with her. 

Thus, although she had often told Harry she could 
keep house, he had smiled, pinched her cheek, and told 
her she did not realize the difference between keeping 
house in France and doing so in America, with a newly 



6 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

imported Bridget for aide de cuisine^ and as Molly 
did not like to boast, she had to let him keep his own 
opinion. But oh, how she longed to show him what un- 
known resources lay within her ! And now the chance 
was hers. 

After the first joyful hour, she behaved very soberly. 
She would take as a matter of course all Harry's mis- 
givings as to the commissariat department, for I am 
sorry to say Harry Bishop, although a Harvard gradu- 
ate, and a fairly intellectual young man, did think a 
great deal of the enjoyment of life consisted in a good 
table, by which he meant not good food only, but good 
cooking and dainty service, and how they were to have 
this on $100 per month he could not see, unless his in- 
come were all spent for servants and food. When he 
told this to Molly she said : 

"No, I propose that we keep house, and spend ex- 
actly what we do for this one room and our board ; that 
is, $80 per month. It must be divided in this way : $20 
for rent (we must never go beyond that), $12 for ser- 
vant, and $10 a week for housekeeping ; that is, $77 a 
month. The three remaining dollars, with the four or 
five we now spend for car fare, will buy your commuta- 
tion ticket." 

" $10 a week for housekeeping! I am afraid you'll 
find that will make a poor show, little wife," he said 
caressingly. " I shall think we are happy and fortu- 
nate, if the $20 we now allow for our clothes and out- 
side expenses will cover the deficit at the end of the 
month." 

" You '11 see $10 is enough.'* 

He laughed good-humoredly. 

" I guess, Pussy, we shall both see things grow * small 
by degrees and beautifully less,' toward the end of each 
month." 

" We '11 hope not," said Molly meekly, for now that 
she hoped her hour of trial and triumph was coming, 
she could afford to let him anticipate eviL 



CHAPTER II. 

AT HOME. 

On the 1st of September our young couple took pos- 
session of their new house. 

It was a small house, or rather cottage, in the fashion- 
able New Jersey town of Greenfield, and contained 
a dining-room, sitting-room and kitchen on the first 
floor, and four rooms above arranged as bed- room, 
guest-room, servants' room and sewing-room. It was as 
slightly built as a house could be, probably, yet in better 
taste than most houses of its class, and Mrs. Winfield's 
taste in furnishing was excellent, so that even Harry's 
fastidious eye was satisfied. 

As for Molly, she spent her first hour in the house 
promenading from room to room, such a luxurious idea 
of freedom and space did that small house give her. 

"Think, Harry! We can actually change rooms 
when we like." 

" Poor little Molly, I did not know that you had hated 
boarding so, or I should not have refused to try this ex- 
periment long ago. I did it for your sake." 

" Never mind, we '11 have such a good time now, that 
we won't think of anything else." 

" What time is your Gretchen to arrive ? " 

" Not Gretchen, but Marta. She came an hour ago, 
while you were seeing to the baggage, and is busy down 
stairs, where I must go to her if we are to have any 
lunch, while you put your books in order." 

" Oh, lunch ! Never mind lunch to-day, bread and 
cheese will do " — 

*' Oh, no ! " said Molly, shaking her head and laugh- 
ing, " I've brought you from the land of abundance ; I 
must take care that you are not made to suffer the first 
day." 



8 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

Marta, Molly's servant, was a newly arrived German 
jofirl whom she had had the courage to take from Castle 
Garden. 

" She will be as green as grass, Molly, " Harry had 
said. 

''Yes, I know, but at least it is better she should 
know nothing than know how to do things badly ; it is 
easier to teach than to unteach." 

"All right, my dear, we will go to Castle Garden, 
then, and interview a new arrival from Germany." 

They did so, and found a thick, short, strong, but stu- 
pid-looking girl was the only one whom it seemed pos- 
sible to take into the house. Molly was a little crest- 
fallen, so far did Marta seem from what she had hoped 
to meet with. Yet she asked only $10 per month. 

" That is $2.00 to the good," thought Molly, "and by 
promising her $12 when she can do my work as I wish, 
she will have something to work for. I believe that is 
where people make a mistake in our country. The in- 
competent girls, if they have only impudence enough to 
ask it, get as good wages as the competent." 

Marta had arrived with two very large trunks, each 
of them no doubt the Thuringian equivalent for a Sar- 
atoga, at which excess of baggage Molly had marveled. 
Molly had taken her to her room, and told her to go 
down when ready and begin taking things out of the 
kitchen closets. This she had heard her doing when 
Harry h^ asked when she was to arrive. 

Molly ^ound Marta attired in what seemed a green 
baize skirt, very short; worked zephyr slippers with 
thick soles, quite new and very large, over gray knitted 
worsted stockings, also apparently new. Over the skirt 
she wore a clean cotton camisole or sacque. Evidently 
Marta was dressed with strict attention to her debut in 
a new place, and was satisfied that her slippers were as 
attractive as they were no doubt comfortable. 

Molly wanted to know exactly what was in the kitchen 
closets, so that she might see what she had to work with, 
therefore she had set Marta to clean them out, although 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 9 

Mrs. Winfield had left everything in such excellent or- 
der that it was not absolutely necessary this first day. 

It was eleven o'clock, and Molly, although she had 
laughed at Harry's anxiety to eat bread and cheese, had 
decided that it would be best to have a luncheon that 
Would be as little trouble as possible, yet one that should 
not seem at all a makeshift, so sensitive was she to 
Harry's good-natured criticism. 

She ordered in the morning what she thought might 
be a month's supplies of groceries, and for the day's 
use: 

2 heads of lettuce, . . . . . $ .06 

1 melon, .10 

2 quarts peaches, . . . . .12 

1 can of boned chicken, . . . .50 
Forequarter of lamb, 8 pounds, . . 1.12 

2 pounds of butter, . ... .50 
2 dozen eggs, 50 

Total, $2.90 

Milk had been left at the house by Mrs. Winfield's 
man, and ice also, and bread by the baker. 

She intended to have for lunch to-day chicken salad, 
omelette and drop biscuit and coffee, all of which could, 
she knew, be prepared in three quarters of an hour, so 
she helped Marta dust and replace the utensils in their 
places, and made notes of what was lacking for her use, 
although, as economy was her object, she decided to do 
with as little addition to what was in the house as pos- 
sible. 

She called Marta's attention as they replaced each ar- 
ticle, telling her its English name, and bidding her re- 
member its place and keep it there. 

Marta spoke no English, but Molly spoke fair Ger- 
man, and she managed to make her understand. As the 
clock struck twelve, Molly took her into the dining-room 
to lay the luncheon cloth ; she showed her how it must 
be done, that the fold must be just in the centre, the salt- 
cellars always neat and smooth, a soiled knife never put 
on, and as she went through these necessary instruc- 



10 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

tions, the thought crossed her mind, how frivolous and 
useless these little niceties must seem to a girl to whom 
perhaps even a table-cloth had hitherto been an un- 
known luxury. What wonder that it was in these 
small things so difficult to train one ? 

When the table was ready, Molly ran into the little 
garden, and gathered a few red geranium flowers and 
their leaves, and arranged them in a glass for the centre 
of the table. 

" This is one of the charms of the country ; even in a 
tiny garden like this, one can always have a spray of 
flowers for the table," thought Molly. 

It was now a quarter past twelve, and one thing that 
Marta must be taught was punctuality. At one o'clock 
lunch was to be, and as Molly would prepare il to-day, 
it should not be a minute behind. 

" Come, Marta, I want to show you how to make bis- 
cuit ; but first we must look to the fire." 

Molly had made it herself before Marta arrived, and 
knew it was good and the oven hot, but she wanted to 
impress on her handmaiden the necessity of assuring 
herself that it was good, before beginning to cook. 

" I set the damper this way, so that the oven would 
heat as soon as the fire is burning well, Marta. You see 
it is hot, and also," taking off the stove lid, " that there is 
fire enough to last ; always make sure of that, so that 
you will not find yourself with a poor fire in the middle 
of cooking." 

This Molly managed to convey by words and actions, 
and Marta nodded comprehension. 

"Now then, as we are such ^ small family, I take a 
pint of flour only, and a scant dessert-spoonful of butter, 
and rub it in the flour this way, do you see? until it is 
just like sand. Now I add a salt-spoonful of salt, two 
tea-spoonfuls of sugar, and a small tea-spoonful of baking- 
powder ; be very careful of the proportions, for it is just 
by doing this that you are sure never to have days when 
things turn out wrong ; they cannot do that, if you are 
exact and right. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 11 

" Now mix all thoroughly, and you see I take this 
scant half pint of milk ; I make a hole in the flour and 
pour it partly in, stirring as I do it, and if I see it needs 
more in order to keep it the stitfest kind of batter or 
the softest kind of dough, I add it; it takes all the half 
pint, you see, but with flour you can't be quite sure of 
the exact quantity, and a tea-spoonful too much would 
make it too thin. Now, you see, it is so very thick I can 
hardly stir it, yet it is far from being stiff enough to 
knead. Butter that tin pan and give it to me." 

Marta understood the order, but began slowly to 
spread butter from the end of a knife. Molly took a 
bit of white paper, and taking the pan from her quickly, 
for the biscuit had now to be got into the oven as soon 
as possible, she rubbed a bit of butter over it. 

" Too many cooks spoil the broth, Marta. If I had 
been working quite alone I should have greased my pan 
before beginning ; it is very bad management to leave 
it." As she spoke she was taking the paste on the end 
of her spoon, and dropping it in little oblong mounds on 
the pan, about two inches apart. In another minute 
they were in the oven, which was very hot. 

" My mother used to pride herself on these biscuits, 
and gave herself fifteen minutes to make and bake 
them. Now for the salad." 

Molly quickly opened the can of chicken she had 
bought, and cut the contents in half ; one portion she 
turned out on a dish, and set the other aside to go into 
the ice-box. Then she set Marta to open olives and salad 
oil, while she hei'self C';|^ the chicken into small pieces, 
removing every bit of skin that was on it. When the 
olives were open, she took a small, sharp, knife and call- 
ing Marta's attention to an olive, she cut into it till the 
edge of the knife touched the stone, and then began to 
peel that stone, as it were, being careful not to break the 
peel, and keeping close to the stone. When the knife 
had passed all around, the stone was in her left thumb 
and finger, the peel or stoned olive in her right. The 
stone was bare except at the ends, and the olive peel 
curled back into its old form, minus those ends.

" Now, Marta, see if you can stone six olives as I did 
that. Never mind if you break the first." 

Molly saw Marta start right, then she poured out a 
table-spoonful of oil and a half one of vinegar, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and a scant half one of pepper. These 
she mixed thorouglily and poured over the chicken, tak- 
ing care that it should go well through it. Then she 
looked into the oven. The biscuits had been in five min- 
utes ; they had puffed up and were nearly done. 

When first the groceries had come, Molly, mindful of 
her mayonnaise, had put an ^gg, bowl, and spoon in the 
ice-box, and, had the day been hot, she would have put 
the oil there too. She went for them now, and knew 
that the minute it took her to get them had sufficed to 
give the biscuit just the tint she wanted, a pale golden 
brown ; she took them out and set them in the warming- 
closet of the range, and returned to her salad. She 
wanted Marta to ^\ash the lettuce, but having set her to 
stone olives was careful not to take her from that task. 

" My bad management," she thought. " I ought to 
have set her to wash the lettuce, and leave it drying in 
a cloth while she did the olives." 

Marta had managed to cut three or four olives into 
small pieces, but had evidently not seized the idea. 
Molly stoned another one for her, and then Marta once 
more began. 

" Now, Marta, I want you to stone those and then to 
wash the lettuce, putting each leaf on a clean cloth as 
you do it. I am going to make a mayonnaise sauce, 
which I must show you another day." 

She broke the egg^ putting the white into a cup, the 
yolk into her ice-cold bowl, and began to stir it. This 
she did for a few seconds, and then added a few drops of 
oil, stirred just long enough for it to disappear in the 
yolk, then added a very little more, and so on, stirring 
steadily, waiting till the last oil was blended before add- 
ing more. When it had once assumed the pale opaque 
yellow that told her the mayonnaise had " come," she 
added oil in rather larger quantities. Five minutes after

this point the mayonnaise was as thick as butter in 
warm weatlier ; a little more oil and it could no longer 
be stirred, for it clung to the spoon. 

" Now, Marta, you see when it gets like this I add a 
few drops of vinegar, which changes the color, — whitens 
it, — but stirring a few seconds blends the vinegar, and 
it now is like very thick cream. I can go on adding oil 
now till it is very thick again." 

When it had again reached the unmanageable point 
Molly put to it, gradually, a half dessert-spoonful of vin- 
egar (which she had ordered to be very strong), a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and a very little white pepper; she 
then tasted it and found it would stand a few drops 
more vinegar for Harry's taste, as he liked it rather 
sharp. 

Marta had finished the olives fairly well, and had the 
lettuce drying on the cloth. 

" Grind two table-spoonfuls of coffee, Marta. Wait, 
I '11 tighten the screw of the mill, while you put that 
French coffee-pot on the back of the stove to get 
warm." 

Molly placed the dry end of the cloth over the lettuce 
leaves and patted them, resolving that a salad-basket 
must be an immediate purchase. She took the leaves, 
now free from water, and laid them over the salad-dish, 
reserving the whitest for the border ; then she placed 
the chicken in the centre, mixing with it the pieces of 
olive Marta had broken in her first attempts, and smooth- 
ing it with a knife 

The mayonnaise would have been all the better if it 
could have stood in the ice-box half an hour ; and, 
another time, she would have it made early on the day 
it was wanted; however, it was thick enough to mask 
the chicken, only less would have answered the purpose 
had it been ice cold. She spread it with a knife evenly, 
tlien laid the stoned olives around at intervals — and 
the salad was ready. 

The coffee being ground, she gave ^he salad to Marta 
to take to the ice-box for the twenty minutes that would

elapse before lunch-time, while she broke three ejigs 
and separated them, and when Marta returned gave her 
the whites to beat to a higli froth. While she was do- 
ing that, Molly got the frying-pan, put a table-spoonful 
of butter in it, and set both to get hot ; then she poured 
boiling water through the coffee-pot (in case it might 
not have been used lately), threw it out, and put two 
full table-spoonfuls of coffee (ground much finer than 
the grocer does it, being, in fact, about like coarse corn 
meal) into the fine strainer, replaced the coarse one 
over it, and then took a tin pint measure, filled it with 
boiling water, and poured half into the coffee-pot; the 
other half she set on the stove to keep at boiling-point, 
while the first dripped through ; then she put half a pint 
of milk to boil, and, seeing the butter was melted, she 
drew back the frying-pan that it might not burn till the 
omelette was ready. 

Marta had not yet reached the point of snow with the 
whites of eggs, and Molly took them from her to finish 
herself. 

" Now, Marta, put that little fringed napkin on the 
dish, and with a fork take up those biscuits." 

She watched her while she performed her task, drop- 
ping two or three on the floor, of course, but that did 
not ruflfle Molly^s good temper, for she knew the girl 
could not have been accustomed to doing things daintily, 
— that if she followed her instinct, it would no doubt be 
to tumble them all out pell-mell together. 

" Now take those to the table, set them on the mat I 
showed you, and come back at once." 

The eggs were now ready, and as the omelette was to 
be the verj^ last thing cooked, she poured the rest of the 
water on the coffee, told Marta to get the waiter ready, 
and then pour the boiling milk into the pitcher and set 
it on it. 

" Now, Marta, take the chicken salad into the dining- 
room, and at the same time take the nielon from the ice- 
box and bring it here as you come back." 

The coffee had now all dripped through ; she took a

cup and poured it full of coffee, and then poured it back 
to run through again, — then she directed Marta to cut 
the melon in half, remove the seeds, and lay the halves 
in a dish with a piece of ice in each half. Knowing 
Marta would not understand cracking ice, Molly had 
put some ready, when she had gone for the bowl and 
Qgg for mayonnaise. 

" Now, Marta, I will run up stairs and get ready for 
lunch ; while I am gone take the melon into the dining- 
room and put it on the table at the side opposite the bis- 
cuit. Remember, at luncheon everything may go on the 
table at once. The butter is ready on a dish in the ice- 
box ; place that, and by that time I will be down." 

Molly had worn a homespun walking-dress, and it had 
been the custom of herself and friend, Mrs. Welles, to 
try and emulate the neatness of the teacher at the cook- 
ing-school they had attended, who dressed handsomely, 
wore no apron, and left her class spotless. They had 
attained to great neatness, but Molly found herself more 
comfortable in a large apron. She did not yet remove 
it, but put on a clean collar, arranged a stray curl, and 
washed her face and hands, then ran down to finish her 
omelette. She put the frying-pan back to a hot place, 
stirred the yolks of eggs with a good pinch of salt and a 
little pepper, and mixed them gently with the whites, 
and poured both into the pan, which she turned about 
that the mixture might run into every part ; and when 
it was "set" underneath, she lifted one side, tilted the 
pan and allowed the uncooked custard to run into its 
place ; this she kept on doing, always turning the cooked 
part toward the centre, until in three minutes it was a 
light custard-like mass ; then, with a cake-turner, she 
folded one side over and slipped the doubled omelette on 
to a hot dish, where it lay, a delicate golden-brown mound. 

" Now, Marta, take in the coffee and milk." 

She heard Harry coming down stairs, and looking at 
the clock saw it was three minutes past one. 

" Going up to dress did that," she thought, " but it is 
not so bad, yet I am sorry Marta has the bad exam- 
ple."

" Odors of Araby the blest ! " quoted Harry, as Molly, 
divested of her apron, the omelette in hand, followed 
him into the dining-room. " 1 smell coffee ! — real aro- 
matic coffee ! " 

He stood and surveyed the pretty lunch table, looked 
at the Delmonico-like salad, the Frenchy omelette, and 
then at Molly. 

" Humph, is this all cooking-school, or is it part ca- 
terer, — if there is such a being in Greenfield ? " 

" It is part cooking-school, and a tiny bit Molly," said 
the young wife. '' No, indeed, I have no acquaintance 
with caterers." 

" This omelette should not palpitate its excellence 
away ; shall I help you, dear ?" 

" Ko ; I devote myself to salad " — then to Marta, 
who was waiting, uncertain what to do : 

" Marta, go into the kitchen and wash up, in quite 
hot water, the soiled pans and dishes." 

" Molly, this omelette is perfect ; you have put forth 
your strength, indeed; but. my dear little girl, I am not 
going to have you spend all your time in the kitchen." 

" I don't mean to, but I can give a couple of hours 
each day, and it will do me good." 

" But this luncheon is quite elaborate. Oh, I Ve 
heard of chicken salad and its intricacy, before now." 

Molly smiled ; she had known it too. " 1 will take 
some of it if you please." 

" Ah, Molly, I believe it 's worth while to give up 
boarding and to live on cold meat, to have such coffee as 
this, and such biscuit ! " 

" I think it is, although I don't intend to live on cold 
meat ; I don't like it." 

" But I suppose we must do a good deal of that, or 
eat quantities of hash, for we can't afford to throw our 
cold meat away." 

" Ah, Harry, what would be the good of my devotion 
to cooking-schools if I could n't do better than that?" 

"If you learned to make chicken salad there, 1 swear 
by them forever." 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 17 

" You '11 forswear your ridicule, I hope." 

" I will, indeed, if only for the sake of this salad ; 
there 's a tang, a something about it, that outdoes my 
previous conception of the dish. Now, Molly, eliminate 
yourself from the cooking-schools, and tell me which 
was the ' tiny bit of Molly.' " 

" Ah, Molly was the ' something ' in the salad — and 
also what made it a very easy instead of a difficult dish 
to prepare. You have eaten, before, salad made of 
boiled or roast chicken. I made this of canned chicken, 
which saves all trouble of preparing, and is besides of 
far better flavor, for the jelly and all the goodness is 
sealed up in the can, instead of escaping into the water. 
I don't like boughten canned things, usually, but the 
chicken is a success." 

" The salad was, at any rate. Now I 'm going to 
smoke ; shall we survey our domain ? " 

" Yes, I '11 be out in one minute, when I have shown 
Marta how to clear away." 

Harry left the room and Marta answered the bell. 

" Now, Marta, bring your tray, set it on that table 
and put these things on it." 

Molly, as she spoke, smoothed over the salt-cellars 
with a spoon, then put them away ; also the napkins, 
while Marta removed the dishes, etc. 

" Now, Marta, never take off the cloth to shake it, 
but do as you see me do now." 

Molly had taken a folded napkin, and brushed the 
crumbs lightly into the crumb-pan. 

"At dinner do this after the meat is removed. Now 
take the cloth by this centre fold, lift it from the table, 
lay it back double, and then fold again in the old 
creases, till it is just as it left the laundress. At dinner 
you shall do it yourself under my direction." 

Molly then went out to join Harry in the little gar- 
den. She had her trunks to unpack, and contents to 
arrange in the bureau drawers, but she meant to devote 
half an hour to her husband, on this first day of their 
home life. 



18 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" Well, Molly, my dear, I begin to think I like house- 
keeping." 

" I knew you would, Harry, but remember we have 
only just begun, and hitches will come sometimes, but 
even at the worst that need be, with moderate care, I 
think you would not go back to our one room again, and 
the routine meals." 

" No ; I begin to feel some of the aspirations of pro- 
prietorship, and to wish this little place were mine." 

" I am so glad, Harry, because if you go on thinking 
so, in spring we can get a similar place of our own." 

When they had walked and talked till Harry said he 
was going in to write letters, Molly returned to the 
house, and found Marta in grand confusion washing 
glasses, silver, and greasy dishes all together. 

" Oh, Marta ! I must show you a better way than that. 
Take those things out of the dish-pan. Get clean hot 
water and a little soap, so. Now take glasses first ; roll 
them round and put them in this empty dish-pan. Now 
the silver. Put the greasy dishes in, and leave them 
wjiile you pour nearly boiling water over the silver and 
glass. Now bring the waiter and wipe each article as it 
comes out of that hot water. You see it takes only a 
minute ; being hot they hardly dampen the cloth. 

" Now set those dry things on a tray, and wash the 
greasy dishes, using more soap if the water does not 
lather ; slip each dish into this hot water, and wipe them 
out of it directly ; don't drain them, and then wipe 
them half cold." 

When she had thus straightened Marta out, and set 
her to make up the fire and sweep the kitchen, she went 
up to her unpacking and other arrangements. 



CHAPTER in. 

molly's first bill of fare. 

Lamb and Mint Sauce. 

Browned Potatoes. Boiled Cabbage, 

Italian Macaroni. Tomato Salad. 

Peaches and Cream. 

Mrs. Winfield had given Molly some useful infor- 
mation about her neighbors, and one item was that she 
could get cream from one, and salad and fresh vegeta- 
bles from another. She had resolved to have a very 
simple dinner for to-day, although she knew it would be 
more expensive than a better-seeming one, where she 
could make good cooking count for half the money. 

She had ordered, on her way to the house, a fore- 
quarter of lamb weighing eight pounds, and at four 
o'clock she went down to see to the fire. Before going 
up-stairs she had put on coals and closed all dampers ; 
now she showed Marta how to rake it, and how to ar- 
range the dampers so that the fire would draw, and the 
oven get hot ; then she left the kitchen, telling Marta, as 
she had everything tidy down-stairs, she could go to her 
room and put some of her belongings in place. 

Molly was now feeling glad of rest, for her unpack- 
ing and unwonted standing had tired her, and, thinking 
she might indulge herself, she took a book and lay down 
on the sofa. Half an hour she lay thus, enjoying the 
repose and her book far more than when she had had un- 
limited opportunity for both. 

" Ha, ha ! what magic is this? Our new housekeeper 
finds time on ' moving day ' to lie down and improve her 
mind," cried Harry, as he came into the room and sat 
down by her side. 



20 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" I could have found plenty to do, although coming 
into a ready-furnished house, left in such perfect order 
as this was, really leaves one little, the first day, but to 
shake down into place and plan what one can do to- 
morrow. I have unpacked, put our own knick-knacks 
about up-stairs, and then I felt tired enough to lie down, 
and thought it wise to do so before I was over-tired." 

'' Of course it was. I have been looking about me 
out-of-doors, ordered a paper to be sent, and priced a 
brood of chickens." 

" Oh, no, no, not yet, Harry ! we '11 see about chickens 
when we are settled, unless, indeed, you want them 
badly." 

" I ? No, indeed ! I thought of you." 

" Then I would rather wait. I see some cabbages 
down at the end of the garden. I have longed to taste 
nice cabbage for months." 

" You vulgar little person ! " 

** You won't say so when you eat it.'* 

" No, but I shan't eat it, my dear. I 've too much 
respect for my digestion." 

" What a pity ! " 

Notwithstanding Harry's determination, Molly went 
for a cabbage, and told Marta to put it in water. Then 
Molly took the fore-quarter of lamb, and with a sharp 
knife she made a deep incision, just where the neck ends 
and the shoulder begins, carrying the knife round nearly 
in a circle, always cutting as deeply as possible until 
the shoulder was free from the quarter. She had now 
before her the breast and rack, or ribs, the scrag, and 
the shoulder, — a nice, neat joint. All she had allowed 
the butcher to do to the quarter was to joint the chops 
and crack the breast across in the usual way, hut not to 
touch the shoulder. 

Molly had seen this process of removing the shoulder 
so often in Europe (where it is a very choice joint), 
that she had felt sure she could manage it. She knew 
that the great thing was to have the shoulder as thick as 
possible, therefore the knife must cut to the rib bones, 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 



21 



and yet that the circle traced by the knife should go 
only within three inches of the edge on the rib side or 
back, and follow the line of the breast on the front, so 




that there remained five or six rib chops with the fat 
upon them, and several from under the shoulder up to 
the scrag, which would be excellent " French chops," 
ready trimmed, — she would only have to scrape the 
bone. 

To-day, however, she only separated the bregist and 
cut off three rib chops, and trimmed them ready for 
breakfast, then put them away with the meat, leaving the 
shoulder out for dinner. It weighed about three and a 
half pounds, and would take, being lamb, which must be 
so well done, an hour and a quarter to cook. She set 
Marta to peel half a dozen potatoes of medium size, 
while she set the shoulder on a wire stand in a dripping- 
pan, then shook a little flour over it and rubbed a little 
salt on the skin. Molly had profited too well by her 
cooking-school lessons to think of putting salt on the 
flesh of meat before cooking, when it would draw out the 
gravy. When the potatoes were peeled and washed, 
she put them in the dripping-pan under the meat, and 
for fear enough fat should not drop from the joint to 
prevent the potatoes from becoming hard and dry be- 



22 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

fore they browned, she laid the scraps of fat she had 
cut from the breakfast chops upon them. It was both 
young and fat lamb, — had it not been, Molly would not 
have risked the strong taste of lamb that is nearly mut- 
ton, on potatoes, nor the hard, whitish dryness of those 
cooked under lean meat. 

The potatoes were well sprinkled with salt and the 
pan set in the oven. Molly had only intended having 
the lamb, and cut-up peaches and cream for dessert, 
yet, seeing she had time, for it was just a quarter to five 
now, and only the cloth for Marta to lay, and the cab- 
bage to cook, she thought she would give Harry some 
of his beloved macaroni as a course. She therefore 
broke a few pipes of macaroni into pieces about six 
inches long, taking a dozen of them, and set them on to 
boil in water and a little salt till tender. While this 
was in process, she had sent Marta for some toma- 
toes from the vine, and when they came, showed her 
how to scald them, and herself squeezed the pulp from 
two large ones through a strainer, and set it in a small 
thick saucepan with a table-spoonful of butter, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and a little pepper, and put it on the 
stove where it would slowly cook. 

Marta had scalded half a dozen tomatoes and dropped 
them, as she skinned them, on some cracked ice. Molly 
took them when they were cold and firm, and with a 
sharp knife cut them into slices and set them in the ice- 
box. 

" Now, Marta, come with me to set the dinner-table. 
T will show you, to-night, and expect you to remember 
afterwards. You first remove the cover and fold it, but 
leave on this white baize." 

Molly watched to see if the girl had remembered her 
instructions at lunch, but found she hud not retained one 
idea. 

" No, Marta, the middle fold, lengthwise, and exactly 
in the centre ; now the flowers, now a plate to each per- 
son, the napkin to the left with a piece of bread in it, a 
large and a small knife, two forks and a spoon to each per- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 23 

son ; above these the glasses and a butter-plate.^ Now 
put this carving-napkin in front of Mr. Bishop, lay the 
large table-mat there, and when you bring in the meat 
set the dish upon it. Now count the dishes and set a 
mat for each, one salt-cellar and pepper-caster at each 
right-hand corner, two table-spoons at the same place. 
Now that is all, and you can come and peel peaches." 

Molly heard the meat in the oven sputtering and hiss- 
ing, and found it browning nicely. She basted it, turning 
the potatoes over, and closed the oven. It was twenty 
minutes past five. 

" Marta, I want you to pay attention to everything I 
do, because the next time we have this dinner I shall 
expect you to cook it alone, and when you have learnt 
to roast one piece of meat properly, you will be able to 
roast any other. Remember the rules, — your oven 
must be quite hot when the meat goes in ; if, after a 
while, you find danger of its burning, cool it, but meat 
can't get brown too quickly to retain the juices. You 
must put no water in the pan, for that steams it. If 
your meat is so very lean that it will be dry, it is of 
such poor quality that you should not try to roast it 
(and that sort of meat you will not have to cook for 
me), or it is a part unsuitable for roasting, and should be 
cooked some other way. Baste often, and when meat is 
half done, — that is, brown and crisp on top, — turn it 
over, as I shall do that lamb in a few minutes. Above 
all things, meat must be brown if roasted." 

Marta had peeled the eight peaches Molly had given 
her, and the latter now told her to three parts fill a 
gallon saucepan with water from the kettle, which she 
had taken care to see full when she set the oven to heat, 
and which was now boiling. 

" Put it in the hottest spot, Marta ; we want it to boil 
quickly. Now that cabbage : it is only a small head, so 
you can cut it in four, and remove the outer leaves, — also 
cut away the core ; wash it thoroughly in two waters ; now 

1 Butter is no longer thought indispensable to the dinner-table, and 
butter-plates are consequently a matter of taste. 



24 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

hold the colander in your left hand, and as you wash 
the cabbage through the second water lay it in it ; then 
pour the water out of the pan and set the colander in it, 
so that all water may run off the cabbage ; the thing we 
want is to check the boiling water as little as possible, 
which the cabbage, filled with cold water, would do. 
Now I am going to turn the meat over, so that the under 
side will brown, while you pour the water off that mac- 
aroni ; it is just tender but not breaking." 

The lamb was brown and crisp on the top when Molly 
turned the under side up, so that it might become equally 
so. Marta brought the macaroni back to the stove, and 
Molly poured over it the tomato juice she had put to re- 
duce. There was enough to moisten the macaroni and 
yet leave a little in the saucepan. She put it at the 
back of the stove, where it would keep about boiling- 
point, but not burn. 

*' Now the cabbage, Marta. You see this water is 
boiling very fast ; put it in gently, so that if there is too 
much in the saucepan you may dip some out before it 
overflows, — no, it all goes in, and the water covers it 
well ; now put in one table-spoonful of salt and one 
scant salt-spoonful of baking soda. Eemember, Marta, 
cabbage must never be allowed to remain long in hot 
water before it boils up ; it must boil very fast ; for that 
reason it must always be in the hottest part of the stove, 
and there must be abundance of water and the saucepan 
always large. As soon as it comes back to the boiling- 
point, take off the cover, and leave it off all the while, and 
push the cabbage down under the water from time to 
time. The whole secret of boiling cabbage without fill' 
ing the house with a bad odor and sending to table a 
vulgar, yellow, wilted vegetable, full of dyspepsia, is to 
remember — rapid boiling, plenty of water, plenty of 
room, and the cover off^ 

She took off the stove-lid as she spoke, and bright- 
ened the top of the fire, and in another minute the cab- 
bage was " galloping." 

"Twenty-five minutes from now it will be done. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 25 

Now, Marta, I want you to run to that white house 
across the lot, and ask for half a pint of cream." 

The peaches were cut up, and Molly put them in a 
bowl and set it on the ice. When she came back she 
grated a small piece of cheese, about as big as her thumb, 
and shook it into the macaroni, shaking the saucepan 
about, so that it would mix without breaking the pipes, 
and set it back to keep hot. 

There was nothing to be done now till the cabbage 
was cooked. 

Suddenly Molly remembered something she had for- 
gotten, and stopped short, very much vexed. 

" I have no cake to eat with the peaches, and Harry 
is so fond of cake ! I 've just time to make a ' fifteen 
minutes' cake,' and I will. No, / won't! it will make 
getting dinner on time a scramble ; I shall go in flushed 
and heated, and Harry will think I am killing myself, 
and Marta will think she may scramble ever after. We 
will do without cake." 

Marta returned with the cream, which was put in the 
ice-box, and she was then set at chopping the leaves of 
some mint for mint sauce. Molly had found, on walking 
around Greenfield the first day they visited the house, a 
quantity of mint growing near, and had pulled a few 
roots and replanted them in the garden. AVhen it was 
chopped quite fine, she took one table-spoonful, an equal 
quantity of sugar, and as the vinegar was very strong, 
she used one table-spoonful of it and one of water, poured 
them over the mint and stirred it till the sugar was dis- 
solved. 

Marta, meantime, had put the plates and dishes to 
warm, and Molly sent the mint sauce to the table. 

" Marta, you will need, to dress the cabbage, a little 
milk, a table-spoonful of butter, and a large tea-spoonful 
of flour. Make the flour and butter to a paste with the 
end of a knife. When I take up the meat, you pour 
the cabbage, which I see will be done in a few minutes, 
into the colander ; the leaves are like marrow now, but 
the stalk is a little hard ; when it is in the colander, press

it with a plate to get every drop of water out, and put 
it back into the pot, with butter and flour, a scant salt- 
spoonful of salt, a little white pepper, and half a tea- 
cupful of milk. You must remember, too, that when I 
am not here to help you dish the dinner, you must put 
your meat in the oven five minutes sooner ; it can be 
taken up before the vegetables, but on no account must 
you take up vegetables first, and let them wait. Never 
put them on too soon. Now put the warm dishes on the 
table in the order in which they will be needed ; the meat- 
platter first, the vegetable-dishes next. The macaroni 
you will bring in after I ring for you to take out the 
meat, — I mean, you will take away the meat and vege- 
tables, then bring in the macaroni and fresh plates, and 
after that, the tomatoes, as a salad ; and, last of all, the 
fruit and tea. Now go and put the cracked ice on the 
table, the pitcher of water, and the butter with a piece 
of ice on it, and come quickly back." 

Molly looked again at the macaroni, found a little 
liquid still at the bottom of the saucepan, and set it 
nearer the fire to cook away, and now left the cover off. 

'' Marta, the cabbage is done ; pour off the water." 

At the same time Molly took the meat out of the 
oven, and set it in the pan on the stove ; she removed 
the crisp brown shoulder to the platter, put the potatoes 
round it, and then poured the fat from the corner of the 
dripping-pan into a jar very gently and carefully, to 
prevent the small quantity of brown sediment there 
was from leaving it too, for that was the gravy ; when 
she could get no more fat from one corner, without let- 
ting the gravy go too, she changed to another, till it 
was free from it ; she set the pan on the stove and 
poured in a cup of water and a pinch of salt ; with a 
spoon she rubbed the pan in every direction, to get off 
the clinging glaze or dried gravy, and then she let the 
water boil fast while she looked after Marta and the 
cabbage which she was stirring. 

"Take a knife, Marta, and cut the cabbage across 
several times, and then, when the milk forms a creamy

dressing and it all bubbles together, turn it out into the 
dish." 

The gravy had in two minutes boiled down enough, 
— there was very little from such a small joint ; it 
was poured through a strainer and, with the meat, put 
to keep warm while Molly made tea. 

" Turn the cabbage out now, Marta ; put the cover 
on the dish and take it to the dining-room ; then take 
the meat and bring in the macaroni when I ask you for 
it, but you can put it in the dish ready, and keep it hot. 
When all is ready, put on a white apron, which I hung 
for you behind the door, and tell Mr. Bishop, whom I 
see in the garden, that dinner is ready." 

Molly had dressed herself in the afternoon and only 
needed to run up-stairs to remove traces of her work. 
As the clock struck six she heard Marta carrying in 
dinner, and got down herself in time to tell Harry it 
was served. 

"What joint may this be, my dear?" Harry asked 
when seated. 

" Ah ! that is the English delicacy, a ' shoulder of 
lamb.' Don't you remember Sam Weller's ' shoulder 
of mutton and trimmings ' at the ' Swarry ? ' There is 
a particular way to carve it, which my mother used to 
be very particular about. I can only describe it by 
saying, you cut it like a leg, and there is the same rea- 
son for beginning at the right side, — on one side yotf 
can cut only a shallow gash and a meagre slice, on the- 
other a deep one, — therefore, till you are familiar with 
the joint, prod for the bone with your fork and make 
one deep cut to the centre on the side where the meat is 
thickest." 

Harry did " prod," and then, planting his fork, stood 
the joint on its side and made one cut, and the joint 
yawned as if a wedge had been cut out. 

" There is a mythical anecdote about a lady starving 
herself to death on shoulder of mutton." 

"How so?" 

" Why, she chose that joint every day and merely

made that cut, so that when it left the table it looked 
as if a meal had been eaten from it, and no one com- 
mented on her abstinence from food. Thank you, I 
will take the dish gravy." 

" I approve of shoulder of lamb decidedly," said 
Harry, during dinner. 

" 1 am glad, for, though our English cousins look on 
it as far more choice than the leg, and pay more for it, 
it is sold here at a much lower price." 

" But what vegetable may this be ? " he asked, look- 
ing curiously at the pale green, appetizing cabbage. 
*' Cauliflower, I suppose, that has met with disasters ? " 

" No, it is cabbage, and I want you to eat and see if 
it is not good." 

" You don't mean to tell me cabbage has been cooked 
in this house to-day ? " 

" You see it." 

" And we are not choked ! Molly, I surrender ; you 
are a magician ! " 

In short, Molly's dinner was a success, and Harry no 
longer looked on cabbage as unfit for a " cultured pal- 
ate." 

While Harry smoked his pipe on the piazza, after 
dinner, Molly went over her accounts. Her grocer's 
bill, for what she supposed would be a month's stores, 
was as follows : — 



2 pounds loaf sugar, 
10 pounds granulated sugar 
25 pounds of the best flour, 
6 gallons kerosene, 
2 pecks of potatoes, . 
1 bottle (small) of olives, 
4 pounds corn meal, . 
6 pounds lard, 
White pepper,

Total, $9.86 

There were several things, such as soap, starch, flour, 
and sugar, Molly would have liked to buy in large quan- 
tities, but she wanted first to see her expenditure ; she 
reckoned that what she had ordered of each article would 
last a month, and a few things, such as vinegar, bluing, 
sauce, wine, etc., much longer. " But I must wait till 
the end of the week before 1 can really know. The first 
week or month is always more expensive in housekeep- 
ing. I must add, too, to my expenditure, to-day, ten 
cents for cream, which will make it $3, but I have meat 
in the house, and if I allow one-fourth of the grocery 
bill for this week I have left $450." 

Molly was not without her anxieties that she might 
be wrong on her estimates, often as she had gone over 
them on paper. Suddenly she looked up. " I forgot 
the yeast, and I want to make bread I "

CHAPTER IV. 

BREAD-MAKING BREAKFAST BAKED POTATOES 

CORN MUFFINS -— BREADED CHOPS HOW TO FRY. 

When Molly made the humiliating discovery that she 
had forgotten the yeast, Harry, who was smoking and 
reading, looked up. 

" What shall I do, that baker's bread is so sour ? " 

" I '11 tell you, let 's sally forth and get it ! It 's a 
lovely night ! " 

" Would you ? " exclaimed Molly, brightly. 

"Why not? You don't suppose you are going to 
monopolize all the merits and reap all the glory of this 
housekeeping, do you ? Why, 1 should not be able to 
have one of the little jokes other married men seem to 
enjoy at their wife's expense." 

'' I hate such jokes," said Molly; "they are so cheap, 
and generally unjust." 

" Then I promise I won't make them. I '11 never 
boast of the servant girls I escort out from New York, 
nor of the baskets I carry, nor the " — 

" You '11 have no chance if you respect the truth," 
said Molly, laughing. " Now if we are going, I '11 put 
on my things." 

The little town of Greenfield was just venturing on 
electric lights, and, with the band of its skating-rink 
making music, had quite a dissipated appearance, as the 
young couple strolled around in search of a grocer, and 
Molly, at the same time, found out a few other facts she 
was anxious to know, and had not yet had time to dis- 
cover. 

As they walked home, Harry said, hesitating, " My 
dear, I don't want to interfere with your housekeeping, 
and I feel my own insignificance in approaching such a 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 31 

subject, but I would diffidently suggest that our family 
is at present very small, and neither you nor I like stale 
bread. Do you think Marta can be induced to consume 
all the ' left over ' loaves ? " 

" No, I don't." 

" Then don't you think we had better try another 
baker who doesn't make sour bread, or" — this was 
said very slowly, as if it would be a sad necessity — " I 
might bring it out from New York." 

Molly laughed merrily. 

" I think I see you ! Surely then you could joke 
about your martyrdom. No, my dear boy, you 're going 
to have no such toothsome morsel as that for a joke, 
but I see you are afraid of stale bread." 

*' The truth is, I have a lively recollection of living in 
the country and eating bread a week old, and older still 
sometimes, when the general appetite failed, and I 
don't believe I 'm up to that sort of thing now." 

" I don't think you are, so you will not be tested. 
Now-a-days one does n't fear baking as one used to do. 
It is no more trouble to make bread three times a 
week than to boil potatoes." 

" I 'm delighted to hear it. I 'm learning every hour 
my own benighted ignorance." 

When they reached home Molly went into the kitchen 
and put one quarter of the yeast cake in a pint of warm 
water, which she made Marta, who was to make the 
next bread, feel was just about as warm as milk from 
the cow, then she put a heaped quart of flour in the 
mixing-bowl and set it in the oven with the door open, 
telling Marta to stir it in a few minutes that it might 
get evenly warm through. 

" I am doing this, Marta, because I do not know this 
flour. It may be very new or damp ; by drying it I 
shall be on the safe side. In cold weather you must 
warm it always, so that the water, yeast, and flour are 
all about the same temperature." 

When the yeast was quite dissolved by stirring, she 
put into the water one tea-spoonful of salt and two of 



32 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

sugar, made a hole in the flour and poured the liquid in, 
^ and the whole made a soft dough which slightly stuck 
to her hands. 

" If it is necessary just shake in a little flour from the 
dredger ; never throw it in by the handful, as the less 
flour you work with the better." As Molly spoke she 
steadied the bowl with one hand and with the other 
w^orked the dough with her fist from the side to the 
middle, so that in five minutes what had been the under 
part was all brought over to the top, and the whole was 
smooth and very elastic to the touch. 

]\Iarta watched with interest and, as Molly could see, 
surprise. 

'• My mother always made her bread thin at night, 
and put in more flour in the morning." 

" Yes. but your mother and mine had no certainty 
that the yeast was good, and it was better to ' prove it ' 
by using part of the flour for a sponge than to waste 
the whole, but now we use compressed yeast, which we 
are sure is good if fresh." 

Marta did not look convinced. She doubtless fancied 
it was some new-fangled notion of Molly's. 

The bread was left, covered with a clean cloth, on 
the table free from draught, for it was a mild night and 
she knew it would be risen well in the morning without 
going into a warm spot. 

The next morning, as it was Marta's first, Molly was 
up and down-stairs a few minutes after her, and found 
she had taken away the ashes and was struggling with 
the fire ; with Molly's help, however, it was soon burn- 
ing in the stove. 

" Now brush off the stove quickly before it gets hot, 
and do so every morning, and on Saturday it needs 
thorough cleaning." Molly looked at the bread as she 
spoke. 

" Fill the kettle now, after you pour out the water 
left in it, set it in the hole of the stove, and then look 
at the bread before I touch it that you may see how it 
should be. It is quite light, as you see, more than dou- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 33 

ble the size it was last night ; now while you go and 
dust the dining-rooDQ, brushing up any crumbs there 
may be first, I will work the bread over, then you can 
come here and sweep your kitchen and the piazzas. 
Molly worked the bread over faithfully for five minutes, 
— had the quantity been larger, of course the time 
would have been in proportion, — and then she set it in 
a warm spot back of the range, and went herself into 
the parlor to arrange it, knowing Marta would not be 
so quick this first morning as she hoped she might be- 
come later. At seven o'clock the work was done, and 
Molly told Marta she must do every morning exactly as 
this morning. 

" Now we will begin to get breakfast, but I shall let 
you do it, because you will see that you have ample 
time without my help, and it must always be on the 
table at eight o'clock. Bring the chops I prepared yes- 
terday, two eggs, and three potatoes." 

Molly looked at the fire, found it bright and the oven 
hot ; she put a shovelful more of coals each side of the 
fire, and then showed Marta how to brush the potatoes 
with a little new brush she had brought for the purpose. 

" See the difference, Marta ? Wash them ever so 
carefully, you can't make the skins so clean that the 
minute you put the brush to them they do not look sev- 
eral shades lighter." 

They were put into the oven. 

" Now, Marta, bring that packet of cracker meal I 
pointed out yesterday, and pour at least half on a dish ; 
now a saucer and the pepper and salt. Break one egg, 
and put the yolk into the saucer, the white into a cup ; 
if there were more chops we would use both white and 
yolk, — as there are so few, for economy's sake we will 
use only the yolk ; put to it two teaspoonfuls of cold 
water and beat it with a fork. Now season those chops 
with salt and pepper, remembering never to do so before 
cooking if they are to be broiled or cooked without 
breading." 

Marta was rather clumsy, but still Molly repressed 



34 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

her own itching fingers, knowing the girJ^ould do bet- 
ter in future if let alone now. 

" Now lay a chop in the egg, — take care it moistens 
every part, — lift it out with the left hand, let it drain 
an instant and lay it on the cracker meal ; now with 
your dry right hand send the meal all over it till every 
bit of the meat is covered with the white dust, then lay 
it aside. Now do the others in the same way." 

Molly looked at the clock ; it was nearly half past 
seven. 

" Hurry, Marta, get the can of lard, and, as that spider 
is not deep, I am going to fry in this agate saucepan ; it 
is just about broad enough for a chop. Put in it at 
least a pound of lard, set it where it will get hot, yet 
not boil till you are ready. Now you can grease the 
muffin-pans, leaving a teaspoonful of lard in one, and 
then make the muffins. We need only a dozen, so you 
can take half a cup of corn meal, half a cup of flour, 
and a teaspoon of baking-powder and half one of salt. 
Mix them quickly. Now a scant table-spoonful of sugar, 
and milk to make a thick batter, break in an egg, and 
beat it all steadily three minutes by the clock, — no, beat 
just as if you were beating eggs, quickly, till it froths. 
Now pour the lard from the muffin-pan in it, stir well, 
and fill the pans nearly full ; set them in the oven, — 
they will bake in fifteen minutes. Go now and set the 
table, and do it quickly." 

On second thought Molly went with her and helped, 
because she could not easily find things. She found 
she had remembered fairly well the directions about the 
cloth. 

" Put the cups and saucers at my left, and that mat 
for the meat before Mr. Bishop ; the potatoes, on a 
folded napkin, you will place on one side, the muffins 
exactly opposite them on the other, butter within easy 
reach of both. Put this tile for the coffee at my right 
hand, the sugar and the milk-pitcher in front, those 
geraniums in the centre, a knife and fork and rmall 
plate to each ; and now come out into the kitchen, set 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 35 

the plates to warm, and a platter. I '11 put the lard now 
on the hottest part of the stove, and a cover over it, so 
that the smell of hot grease may be as little as possible, 
and while it gets hot you can grind the coffee. You 
remember how to make it ? Put a pint of milk on to 
boil, and set the other pint away. Now try the fat, and 
remember that what I am now going to teach you with 
these chops applies to all kinds of frying. The way you 
crumbed those chops is the way you must crumb cut- 
lets, fish, oysters, or croquettes. They are better 
crumbed a little while before they are fried, as they 
have time to dry." 

Molly had cut, as she spoke, some little cubes of 
bread. 

" Come and watch, Marta. This fat is very hot, but 
I doubt if it is hot enough, although it begins to 
smoke." 

She dropped in one bit of bread, it sizzled, but after 
waiting a few seconds remained white. 

" It is not hot enough or that bread would have col- 
ored. Get the colander, set it on the stove with this 
sheet of grocer's paper in it. When you take any fried 
article out of the fat, lay it first on the paper, then on a 
hot dish. Now let us try the fat again." 

Another bit of bread was dropped into the fat, and 
this time it colored in a few seconds. 

" Remember, if I had six chops instead of three I 
should let the fat get hotter yet, because they would cool 
it so much. Now drop each chop gently in, — that 's 
the way. If they were very thick, as soon as they 
were brown I would draw back the fat, and leave them 
longer ; as it is, two minutes will brown them beauti- 
fully, and they will be cooked through." 

" Two minutes ! " murmured Marta, in expostulating 
tones. She could hardly be expected to credit that. 

" Yes ; you forget this fat is far hotter than any oven 
would be, and they are completely immersed in it. You 
can take up the potatoes if they are done, wipe them 
and lay them on the plate, and I will take up the muffins. 



36 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

The two minutes are up ; look at the chops : you see 
they are most beautifully brown all over alike ! " 

Marta exclaimed, " Schon ! " and stolidly attentive as 
she had been to all else, the golden chops evidently ap- 
pealed to some hidden well of enthusiasm. They were 
taken up, laid first on the paper, then on the dish, and 
put to keep hot while the breakfast was taken to the 
table. 

When the chops were going in, Molly said, "When 
we are settled, I shall want you always to put a little 
parsley on the dish with fried things." 

The muffins were light and crisp, the potatoes looked 
far more tempting in their pale-yellow, well-brushed 
skins than they usually do, and altogether the breakfast 
was as dainty a meal as heart could sigh for. 



CHAPTER V. 

HOW TO MANAGE THE FAT THAT HAS BEEN USED 
FOR FRYING CUP CAKE. 

When breakfast was on the table, Molly directed 
Marta to go up-stairs with pail and cloth and to bring 
down the soiled water, till the ewer with fresh, etc. As 
Harry rose to put on his coat, Molly ran up-stairs and 
put on her hat and gloves. " I am going to the depot 
with you, Harry," she said, when she reappeared ready 
for walking, " and I shall do my marketing as I re- 
turn." 

" That is a good idea, Molly ; the walk will be good 
for you." 

Before leaving the house, Molly passed through the 
kitchen, and told Marta, after she had finished her break- 
fast, to wash the breakfast things, but to leave the fat 
(that she had herself removed from the stove and cov- 
ered, so that the fumes might not fill the house, before 
she went in to breakfast) till she returned. " After you 
have washed up, if I am not here, fill the lamps and 
clean the chimneys." 

This Marta was doing when she got back, and while 
she finished, Molly took off her outdoor clothes and 
donned her apron. "Now, Marta, I will show you 
about this fat, and I want you to remember to do just 
as you see me do, every time you use it. This is a piece 
of cheese-cloth ; the fat is still quite hot (Molly had left 
it on the iron shelf over the range), but not scalding; I 
put the cloth over this empty lard -pail, and without 
shaking the fat, pour it through the cloth. You see all 
this fine black sediment that remains on the cloth and in 
the saucepan ? That, if it were not strained out, would 



38 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

discolor whatever you fried in it. When it is strained 
each time, you can use it a dozen times ; so you see it is 
not extravagant to fry in deep fat. Now you have a 
very greasy cloth and saucepan, but pour a quart of 
boiling water and a piece of washing-soda as big as a 
walnut on them, stir them, and you see you have no 
more grease, only some nice soapy water and a clean 
saucepan ! " 

Marta's interest had been all alive since she had seen 
the chops, and she explained how often she had seen 
cooks in Germany bread cutlets, and they came out of 
the pan only breaded here and there. Never had she 
seen them all over alike, except at a restaurant where 
she had been dish-washer, and where there was a man 
cook. 

"• The crumbs come off for one of two reasons, — either 
they were too large (when I use bread instead of cracker 
I sift them), or the fat had not been hot enough ; two 
or three large crumbs would spoil the whole, for they 
would fall off, bring others with them, and leave bare 
pale spots." 

As she made the explanation she had worked over 
the bread, which had risen to twice its first bulk, and put 
it into a tin pan, and set it to rise again. " That will 
only make one nice loaf, but it is as much as we shall eat 
while fresh. Now, while my hands are in flour, I will 
make a plain cake, and while it is baking, Marta, you 
and I will go up-stairs to the bedrooms. But first look 
well at the bread in the pan ; you see it is barely half 
full ; I worked it thoroughly, so that it has again to rise ; 
when it is twice the size it now is it will be ready for 
the oven." 

She got for her cake two eggs, half a cup of butter, 
one of sugar, and a cup and a half of flour, a lemon, 
a nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of baking-powder. Re- 
membering she would need them, she had brought half 
a dozen of lemons and aii ounce of nutmegs in with 
her. She set Marta to cream the butter and sugar, 
while she separated the yolks of the eggs and beat 
the whites till they were quite firm. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 39 

"This is only a plain 'one, two, three, four' cake, 
Marta, but it will be made nicer by the flavoring. When 
you know how to make this cake, always remember to 
vary the flavor, and the cake will seem much better than 
ordinary cup cake; sometimes you can add, the last 
thing, a cup of candied lemon and orange peel, cut fine, 
— I will show you how to candy them when we have 
collected enough, — or a cup of currants ; either of these 
must be made warm, flour shaken through them, and the 
cake stirred only just enough, after they are in, to mix 
them, or they will all go to the bottom. This cake we 
will flavor with lemon and nutmeg. Mix the two yolks 
now with the butter and sugar, grate half the nutmeg, 
beginning at the blossom end or there will be a hole all 
through it ; when you see that, always turn the nutmeg, 
begin at the other end, and there will be no hole ; then 
grate the peel of the lemon to them, add a quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt, and mix all together ; now sift in part 
of the flour with the baking-powder, then part of this 
cup of milk, now more flour, and the rest of the milk ; 
the batter is rather stiff as yet, but the whites of the 
eggs will thin it enough, — they are the last to go in." 

Molly buttered a cake-pan, and the mixture, a thickish 
batter, was poured in, and then powdered sugar was 
sifted over and the cake put in the oven. 

" The oven is nice and hot. I like to cover a cake 
the first half hour, so I will put this pie-pan over the 
top ; another time I will have a piece of card-board ready 
and keep it for the purpose. Remember, if you want 
to make this cake when we are short of butter, you can 
use half lard. Now look at the bread ; it will be ready 
in about twenty minutes, and the oven will be just nice 
for it. Meanwhile we will go upstairs."

WHAT " 

Molly congratulated herself on her unusual good 
fortune in securing such a girl as Marta, when she saw, 
in initiating her into the bedroom work, how well she did 
it. But she was not to be without her trials, even with 
this treasure, any more than every other housekeeper. 
When she knew, by the time, that the bread was ready, 
being deep in the draping of some chintz she had had in 
their city room, she told Marta to run down and put it 
in the oven, and to take the cover off the cake, but on 
no account to move or shake it, as the bread would go 
in on the other side of it. 

Marta ran down, if the term can be applied to the 
lumbering movement with which she hurled herself 
down-stairs. Molly heard her carrying out her order, 
and then she heard a sound that elicited an exclamation 
of annoyance. It was the sound of the oven door closing 
with a tremendous bang. 

" My poor cake ! how vexatious ! " For a moment 
vexation impelled her to scold Marta, but if Molly was 
one tiling more than another, she was reasonable. Her 
blame was for herself more than for the girl. " How 
could she know ? I must give her a general caution ; 
I suppose the cake is gone utterly." 

It was. She met Marta returning to her up-stairs 
work smiling serenely. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 41 

" Marta, 1 want you to come and look at the result of 
banging the oven door in that way when cake is in the 
oven, — and you must remember, too, never to set a pot 
heavily on the range ; when a cake has once risen, until 
quite done, any sudden jar will cause it to settle down. 
Look at this ; you see the cake is all sunken." 

Marta stood, the picture of concern, her teeth pressed 
tight over her under lip. 

" Never mind, we '11 look on the cake as a lesson ; 
to-morrow you must make another as you saw me do 
this. Go and finish up-stairs, and I think, as we have 
no cake to-day, I will make a pie for dinner. When 
you come down you will see me make the paste, as every- 
thing I do I hope you will do later." 

When Marta came down Molly weighed out six ounces 
of butter and eight ounces of flour — the butter was 
straight from the ice-box and very firm ; these she put 
together in a chopping-bowl with a pinch of salt, opened 
the window to let in the cool air, and then chopped but- 
ter and flour together, but not very fine, the butter still 
remaining in well-defined bits, some as large as white 
beans, when she left off. Making a hole in the centre, 
she poured in a small half cup of ice-water, and made it, 
with as little pressure as possible, into a firm dough. A 
few bits of butter and flour fell from it, but she did not 
stay to work them in smoothly, explaining to Marta, as 
she turned all out on to the pastry-board, that they 
would roll in smooth, and the less handling the pastry 
had the better. She rolled it out half an inch thick, 
folded it in three, putting any little flakes of butter that 
might be on the board upon it, and rolled it out again. 
(This was done as quickly as possible, so that the warm air 
of the kitchen might not soften the butter.) She dredged 
very little flour on it, and folded it again in three, rolled 
it again, and then once more folded and rolled it, making 
three times in all. 

" Now, if I were in a hurry, I should use the pastry 
at once, as it is ready, but it will be so much lighter and

come ont to see to the dinner. I will have cold Iamb 
and salad for my lunch, — you know how to prepare the 
lettuce." And Molly left the kitchen, knowing she had 
now some hours in which she could attend to getting 
things into place, etc. 

Hardly was her luncheon cleared away, however, 
when Marta brought in a card, saying a lady had given 
it to her, but she did n't know what she wanted. It bore 
the name of Mrs. Merit, and realizing that the visitor 
was left standing at the front door, Molly hurried out 
to receive her. She apologized for Marta's keeping her 
there. 

" Don't mention it. This is a very early call ; but 
coming into a furnished house is so different from an 
empty one, — you get settled in a few hours ; besides, I 
knew this was your first experience of housekeeping, and 
if one wants to be of real use it is of no use to leave it 
till your difficulties are over." 

The lady had followed Molly into the parlor as she 
spoke, and seated herself in the rocking-chair. 

*' You are very kind," said Molly, thinking how 
very friendly it was. 

" I mean to be kind, my dear. I know the difficulties 
of inexperienced young housekeepers, and I want you to 
know that your nearest neighbor is ready to run right in 
any time you want, and if there 's anything 1 can tell 
you, why, you know where to come." 

" Thank you very much indeed," said Molly grate- 
fully ; " I shall not forget." 

The conversation now drifted off into talk about 
Greenfield, and Molly learned the names of most of her 
near neighbors, and, it must be confessed, more of their 
peculiarities than she cared to hear. 

*'I'm your nearest neighbor on this side the street, 
but there 's poor Mrs. Lennox right opposite, poor thing ! 
I 'm glad she 's got some one to take Mrs. Winfield's 
place to her. She was a real good neighbor, and when 
one's life 's as hard as hers, a friendly neighbor is a 
good deal." 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 43 

Molly did not ask why Mrs. Lennox was qualified by 
the adjective "poor" nor why her life was hard. She 
began to recognize in Mrs. Merit a type of good-hearted 
women given over-much to interesting themselves in 
other people's affairs. Mrs. Merit rocked serenely on, 
however, and proceeded to question Molly on her knowl- 
edge of housekeeping and to give some strong hints on 
economy. 

" You see, my dear, young people start off with an 
idea of style, and it takes them some .time to find out 
the best and cheapest way of doing things, and there 's 
receipts 1 've got that I 've altered and changed so 's 
they don't cost half, and taste, to my thinking, just as 
well, and no danger of dyspepsia, and I 'd be glad to 
send you over my written book." 

Again Molly thanked her, and promised to avail her- 
self of the book. 

" Yes, and you '11 find your money goes a deal further ; 
my receipts don't call for eggs and butter as if they 
grew out on the bushes." 

" Well, you see," said Molly timidly, " we need so lit- 
tle of anything that even a recipe which calls for what 
seems many eggs or much butter can generally be divided 
by four for us, and the four eggs or half pound of butter 
become only one egg and two ounces of butter ; so we 
can have the good things and still spend little." 

" But then you have so little of it, and it wastes time 
to make things in small quantities." 

"Yes, but my time is not valuable, and besides it 
would be no economy for me to make things too plain, 
for we might not eat them at all ; and the same would 
happen if 1 made much at a time of anything, — it would 
not be eaten up. Mr. Bishop likes variety." 

" Well, 1 believe in husbands' liking food that 's accord- 
ing to their means, and not in young women wearing 
their lives out cooking for them. Mr. Merit was always 
satisfied with a plain, wholesome dinner, and that I took 
care he had." 

Mrs. Merit's words were verging on the unpleasant, 



44 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

but her manner was so unconscious that Molly felt sure 
only kindness was meant ; she was simply instructing 
the young and inexperienced wife. 

" I^ow there 's poor Mrs. Lennox, she 's got four chil- 
dren, and her husband is as poor as a church mouse, and 
as pernickety about his eating — nothing she can get is 
good enough for him ; and the way she manages to make 
both ends meet, and to dress them children as nice as any, 
is a wonder to every one, though, poor thing, she is 
wearing herself out." 

Shortly after, finding Molly was not curious about 
Mr. and Mrs. Lennox, Mrs. Merit protested that she 
was paying an unwarrantably long visit, rose and left, 
saying, as she did so, " You won't be lonely long, you 
are not like strangers ; being such friends of Mrs. Win- 
field, every one will make a point of calling very soon." 

Molly noticed, as she returned to the parlor, that 
Mrs. Merit was standing at the door of the house she 
had pointed out as Mrs. Lennox's ; doubtless she had 
gone to report her visit. 

Molly went from her visitor to the kitchen. She had 
ordered in the morning a porterhouse steak and a dozen 
oysters on the half shell. As the butcher was also fish- 
monger, he had no objection to send so few, and she 
had impressed on him that both were to be sent after 
five, and the oysters opened at the house. She now 
told Marta, when they should come, to put the oys- 
ters into the ice-box at once, and went to assure herself 
that the fire was made up and would be ready by five 
o'clock to cook. She found, as she had feared, that 
Marta had forgotten, and the fire was at that stage of 
intense brightness which gives place to a mass of dead 
white ash a little later, but would quickly burn up with 
fresh fuel. 

" How fortunate I came out, Marta ; red as this fire 
is, in half an hour it would have been near out. Put a 
little coal on ; when it is lighted well, not before, you 
can rake out the ashes and put on more coal, but not 
too much." As she spoke she opened all the drafts. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 45 

She meant to have a ragout of the rougher part of the 
lamb — the neck piece — as a second dish ; if Harry did 
not care for it at dinner, it would make a very savory 
one for breakfast. She cut it up into neat pieces ; 
there was about a pound and a half of meat, very lean, 
and, properly treated, the tenderest in the whole sheep. 

" If I had to pay the same for this part of the lamb as 
for the loin, I should still prefer it for boiling and stew- 
ing," she said to Marta, " but so few people will believe 
it. Get me one onion and a carrot, and prepare them. 
I wish I had some canned peas, they would be such an 
addition ; but I have not half the little things in store yet 
tliat I need." 

Molly was making this ragout, not that it was needed 
for dinner so much, although it made variety and a bet- 
ter-seeminij table, but her chief thought was for the break- 
fast. Having the vegetables prepared, and the range 
being by this time hot on the top, she put a spider, con- 
taining a table-spoonful of butter and one of flour, on the 
stove, and told Marta to stir slowly till the flour and but- 
ter were pale brown, while she tied six sprigs of parsley 
and half a bay leaf together. When the flour and but- 
ter formed a smooth brownish paste, or roux., as the 
cooking-books call it, the carrots and onions, cut small, 
and the meat were added, with a half salt-spoonful of 
pepper, three level salt-spoonfuls of salt, and a tea-spoon- 
ful of vinegar. These were all stirred round, and a 
close cover put on. 

" Now these have to be stirred every minute or so, to 
prevent burning, till brown, and while the ragout is 
cooking I will make a lemon pie. I have written the 
recipe, Marta, as I shall do all for the future, and you 
will keep the book in the kitchen. I will read it over 
to you." 

The recipe was, of course, written in German. Molly 
had not been able to do it 'vithout help from the diction- 
ary, but she remembered chat she was improving her 
German, which, indeed, was one of her reasons for tak- 
ing a German girl, the compulsory practice would be so 
good for herself.

■ " Half a cup of fine bread crumbs, just enough milk 
to swell them, two eggs, three table-spoonfuls of sugar, 
two of butter, the juice of one lemon, the grated rinds of 
two. Beat sugar and butter to a cream, then the eggs 
and lemon juice, and last the bread and milk. You can 
make the mixture while I roll the paste and get the pie 
ready, but first I 'm going to knock a few holes in this 
tin pie-plate, so that the crust may be light at the 
bottom." 

She took a small nail and hammer, and with it perfor- 
ated the pie-plate till it looked like a colander. The. 
paste was firm and hard, and Molly rolled it out with 
perfect ease, the third of an inch thick, without its once 
sticking to the board, which was lightly floured. She 
laid the pie-plate on it, and cut a circle a little larger 
than the tin to allow for the depth. Every touch she 
made was quick and light, just as if the paste were tulle 
or white satin. She turned the plate over, laid the paste 
on it, and pressed it only on the bottom, never touching the 
edges. She cut a little piece and put it in the oven to 
try it. Then she cut two long strips of paste, about an 
inch wide, and laid them lightly around the pie, so as to 
make the edge twice the thickness of the bottom ; she 
gentl}" pressed the lower edge of this strip to make it ad- 
here to the pie, and then poured in the lemon mixture. 

" Mr. Bishop does n't like meringue, or I would have 
kept out the two whites of eggs, to make it," said Molly, 
as she took out the little "'trier" she had in the oven. 

It had risen a full inch, and " the separate flakes could 
be counted ! " Marta exclaimed, as she saw it. Her in- 
telligence only seemed to rouse when she saw something 
out of the ordinary routine of cooking, because, as Molly 
afterwards found, her ideal of cooking was what the man 
cook at the restaurant in Germany could do ; she never 
expected to see a lady do them, and he had made puflf 
paste just like this, and it seemed magic to her. 

" And if she had never lived at the restaurant she would 
not have had intelligence enough to know what to ad- 
mire. It is the old story, — to those who know nothing

of art, a gay chromo is better than a fine painting," said 
Molly, when she told Harry, who broke into good-natured 
laughter. 

" Oh, my dear Molly, you are too delicious in your 
enthusiasm ! What would our artists say to such a com- 
parison ? '* 

Molly joined in the laugh. " It sounds absurd, but 
the principle is the same. The poor girls who have no 
experience of good cooking or refined living can't be 
expected to appreciate it." 

But this was in the evening, and we are digressing 
from the dinner. 

By the time the pie was in the oven, the lamb had 
been twenty minutes in the spider, — Marta occasionally 
stirring it about. Two thirds of a pint of hot water was 
now added (it left plenty of gravy around the meat, yet 
did not cover it), the parsley was put in, and the spider 
closely covered and set where it would just simmer, as 
the success of the dish depended on its simmering, and 
not boiling. Molly waited to see it come to the boiling- 
point. 

" Now, Marta, remember that to simmer means this,'* 
she said, pointing out the gentlest little sizzling round 
the etlge of the pan. " Perhaps you hardly think it is 
cooking at all, but that scarcely perceptible motion is 
what I mean when I say, 'let it simmer;' faster than 
that would be boiling. You must understand these dis- 
tinctions if ever you hope to make a good cook. We are 
going to have Lima beans, and stuffed potatoes, and 
cheese canapees — to use up the baker's bread — and, 
as 1 do not mean to be in the kitchen to-night except 
just as you broil the steak, I will get everything ready 
now." 

So saying, she cut slices of bread half an inch thick, 
then, with a large round cutter, cut circles ; these she 
cut in half — they were not the true crescent shape that 
canapees should be, but they would answer ; then she 
put a table-spoonful of butter in a small saucepan (using 
a saucepan, because to fry, or rather sauter, so little, the 



48 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

butter required would be twice as much if it had to go 
over the large space of a frying-pan), and then she fried 
four of the canapees a very light brown. When done 
she took them up, and grated about an ounce of cheese, 
and setting the canapees on a small tin ready for the 
oven, she heaped the grated cheese on them, then 
sprinkled on them a little pepper and salt. 

" Marta, those are ready, but need not go into the 
oven till I tell you. At five you wash four large pota- 
toes and put them into the oven ; at a quarter past you 
can put the Lima beans into a saucepan of boiling 
water, with two tea-spoonfuls of salt and one of sugar ; 
let them come quickly to the boil again." 

Molly took the pie out of the oven. It was beauti- 
fully brown, and the edge, half an inch thick when it 
went into the oven, was now more than double, and 
more flaky than real puff paste, as generally made. 

*' Now, Marta, I '11 leave you to set the table quite alone 
to-night, and to do everything by yourself, except broil the 
steak, which I have not yet shown you how to do, and to 
dress the vegetables. Chop ready for me two table-spoon- 
fuls of parsley and one slice of onion very fine." 

Molly had to congratulate herself on having gotten 
so far forward with the dinner, for just as she was leav- 
ing the kitchen Mrs. Lennox came. 

" Mrs. Merit told me you were settled and ready to 
see your neighbors, so I would not delay coming 
over. I have not the same good excuse as she has for 
so early a visit, for, beyond good feeling, I cannot be of 
any use to any one, my hands are so completely tied 
with my family; but you are Mrs. Winfield's friend, 
and you seem no stranger to me." 

" But no excuse is needed," said Molly. " I think it 
exceedingly kind." 

Mrs. Lennox was a very nervous-looking woman, who 
had once been very pretty, and was still young enough 
to be so. When they had talked a little while, it 
proved that one of Molly's dear friends had been a 
school-fellow of Mrs. Lennox. This made them quite 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 49 

intimate in a few minutes, and Molly found herself talk- 
ing freely of her hopes and plans. 

" Oh ! but how could you have the courage to keep 
house, when you had no family to make boarding impos- 
sible ? " 

" But it needed more courage to go on boarding, I 
think," laughed Molly. 

" Oh ! wait a bit, till your servant goes off at a mo- 
ment's notice, just as you have company to dinner ; or 
till your husband begins to criticise the food, or — if 
you are too newly married for that — till you see him 
look at the table in despair, and sit down and eat as if 
it were all chaff, — those are the things that will make 
you long to give it all up," 

" But," said Molly gravely, for that bitter phrase, " if 
you are too newly married for that," shocked her, " I 
don't think, if girls served me so half a dozen times a 
year, it would be more than a temporary annoyance, 
while to board is a daily and hourly discomfort ; as for 
my husband, I shall try at least to give him as good 
food as we had while boarding." 

" Yes, as good food, but it is the variety ; on small 
means it is impossible to have it. You smile ! it is all 
smooth sailing for you yet, but I assure you the first 
time you find yourself without a girl you '11 realize what 
I mean; but it is beautiful to see your enthusiasm, and 
recalls my own early married life." 

She sighed ; Molly pretended not to hear her, al- 
though she was full of sympathy for her weary looks ; 
she laughed lightly and said, " Well, I don't believe 1 
should be in despair to find myself without a maid ! It 
would worry Mr. Bishop for my sake, but not me." 

" That 's all very well in theory, but when it comes to 
having the breakfast to get, the fires to light, and you 
find the bread won't rise, and nothing goes as it ought 
to go, you '11 be inclined to sit down and cry." 

" But I think things would go better than that. I am 
so fond of cooking that I shall practice a good deal, so 
that, if I find myself deserted, we shall not feel the loss 
beyond less leisure for me." 



50 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" You are fond of cooking — tbat 's different ! I hate 
it, but then that 's because I have it to do, I suppose, for, 
though I sympathized with you in advance in case you 
are left without, I never have a servant ; and as I have 
four children, and make all their clothes and my own, 
you may suppose I have no time to spend over the fire. 
We are obliged to live very plainly, and if I can man- 
age to get the food on the table in an eatable form, 
that 's all I try for. I tell you this now because, if, as 
I hope, we should become more than formal acquaint- 
ances, you will know what to expect at my house." 

There was a pained look in the weary face, as if the 
saying had not been pleasant, and Molly's heart ached 
at the sad picture of toil her words conjured up. And 
yet, after she had left, Molly remembered the dress of 
cheap material, but trimmed to excess, and thought of 
the weary hours it had taken to make, and wondered 
why she did it. 

Molly, when again alone, hesitated what to do. She 
knew of several bits of sewing she had to do for the 
house, but she was a little tired; and besides, after a 
week or two Marta would not need her so much in the 
kitchen — or, at least, she hoped not ; meanwhile, the new 
" Century " was on the table, and she took it up to read 
till it became necessary for her to go and direct Marta. 

Molly had had a hint or two from her two visitors 
that they considered she would be making rather a slave 
of herself, but she had no such intention ; she did not 
think it harder work to be in the kitchen than at the 
sewing-machine. At half past five she went to see if 
the table was neatly laid, and made a few changes, call- 
ing Marta's attention to them ; then w^ent into the 
kitchen, and found the parsley and onion not nearly fine 
enough ; these she chopped over, and by that time the 
potatoes and Lima beans were done. 

" Pour the water off the beans, Marta, then dress 
them just as you did the cabbage last night; stir them 
well around, and move them to a part of the range 
where they will just simmer. When you have done it, 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 51 

you can put the oysters on the table, six on each plate, 
the points to the centre, with a quarter of a lemon in 
the middle of each." 

While she was speaking, Molly had put a little milk 
on to boil, and cut the tops from the potatoes, and hold- 
ing them in a cloth, scooped out the inside with a spoon, 
into a bowl which she had made hot, without breaking 
the skin ; when the potato was all out, she added to it 
a table-spoonful of butter and the parsley and onion, 
moistening the whole with hot milk, and then with a 
fork she beat it rapidly back and forth till very white 
and light ; then she seasoned with salt and pepper to 
taste, and filled the skins, which she had put to keep 
hot again, and set them in the oven. The milk being 
boiling and the process quick, they had not had time to 
cool much. 

" Now, Marta, heat the gridiron and put your dishes 
to get hot ; then put the steak on, open all the drafts 
that the smoke may go up." 

The fire was clear and not too high, and she watched 
while Marta broiled it, directing her to turn the steak 
frequently. 

" Keep the gridiron tilted from you, so that the grease 
runs to the back of the stove, and don't be frightened at 
its flaring ; better it should flare than smoke ; it is the 
smoke, not the flame, that blackens the steak." 

When it had broiled eight minutes it was to be laid 
on a hot dish, with a lump of butter on it, and liberally 
seasoned with pepper and salt. But as Molly heard 
Harry come in, she left the butter and seasoning ready 
and went to him, trusting Marta to bring the dinner to 
table, telling her, as she left the kitchen, to put the 
cheese canapees in the oven, on the upper shelf. They 
would be brown by the time they had finished the meat. 



CHAPTER Vn. 

MOLLY AND MRS. LENNOX — ECONOMICAL BUYING 
MAKES GOOD LIVING. 

A WEEK passed, and Molly found her ten dollars 
left a narrow margin, as will be seen from the account 
she triumphantly showed to Harry, and the week's 
bills of fare, which she wrote out neatly, appending 
every recipe, and which, for the benefit of those who 
may wish to do likewise, I will give in its place ; but 
before that week was over, Molly was revolving other 
problems. She had seen Mrs. Lennox again, and Harr^ 
Was delighted with Mr. Lennox, who traveled on thv 
same train with him, and in answer to Molly's remarks 
on the hard life his wife led, he maintained that his pity 
was for the husband. 

" I can picture to myself that household, Molly, and 
the scrambling meals that man gets. Why, he was as- 
tounded when I told him we lived just as well as I want 
to live, and what we had to live on. Yes, dear, I fear 
I did boast to the poor fellow of the charming little din- 
ners you got up, and asked if he knew any one who 
could beat that ? He said : — 

" ' Well, I wish Mrs. Bishop would teach my wife how 
to put some flavor into what we eat. Our means are 
narrow, but I do know that if Letty knew how to cook, 
we should all be better, and she herself. We can't ex- 
pect fancy dishes — our family is too large and our 
means too small for that — but even Irish stew may 
taste of something besides onions and hot water.' 

" I should think it could ; nothing I enjoy better than 
Irish stew. However, I didn't crow any more over 
poor Lennox, but you needn't give all your pity to 
Mrs. Lennox." 



TEN, DOLLARS ENOUGH. 53 

Already Molly had decided in her own mind that 
Mrs. Lennox was making a great mistake in the way she 
had chosen for doing her duty to her family, and that the 
weary days spent at the sewing-machine might be partly 
spent in the kitchen with advantage to her own health 
and her cliildren's. She longed to help her, but dared 
not take the liberty. But the day came when Mrs. Len- 
nox herself gave the opening. They met in the street 
on Saturday, and Molly mentioned that she was on her 
way to the butcher's. 

" I see you go every morning down town, but it is 
rare for me, for I can't spare the time, so I have to trust 
to what the butcher sends. You see we live so plainly 
that we have n't much choice — it 's just steak and 
chops and roast beef. Mr. Lennox can't bear cold mut- 
ton, so we never get a joint of it." 

" But don't you think the morning walk would do 
you good ? I believe it will me ; and then I have some 
satisfaction in seeing my meat before I buy it, althou^ 
we buy very little." 

Molly was terribly afraid of seeming didactic, and 
spoke in a rather apologetic way. 

"Yes, but you have n't four children, my dear; how- 
ever, as I am out, I will go with you. How I wish you 
would tell me what to get in place of chops for to-day 
and a roast for to-morrow ! We all hate them, but we 
can't afford poultry." 

" I hardly like to suggest, for I don't know your 
tastes; but if I wanted to live cheaply, — forgive me, 
you have given me reason to suppose that you have to 
be economical " — 

" Economy is n't the word, — we can barely make 
ends meet, and I work myself to death to avoid spending 
an unnecessary dime." 

" I know you do, and for that reason I would like to 
tell you a few things I learnt in France, where they 
make a franc go as far as we would a dollar, and yet 
live well." 

" Tell it me ; but for goodness' sake don't tell me that 



64 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

lentils are as good as meat — we abhor lentils — or that 
peas and beans are nitrogenous ; I 've read that sort of 
thing till I 'ra sick ; if you have n't the appetite of a 
ploughman you can't eat things because they contain 
nitrogen any more than you can live on medicine." 

" I 'm a little of your opinion, but I mean really good 
living that, if you did n't know the cost, would seem al- 
most luxurious. It is simply buying, and using what 
you buy, judiciously." 

Mrs. Lennox smiled a little incredulously, but said, 
courteously, " I am quite open to conviction." 

" What do you propose to pay for your roast of 
beef?" 

" It will be at least $2, for it is of no use getting less 
than eight pounds ; and chops for to-day will be about 
35 cents." 

" And how long will the roast last ? " 

" It has to last till Tuesday, though out of an eight- 
pound roast there is n't much but bone and fat the third 
day." 

" And you have then something extra to get for 
breakfast ? " 

She laughed a little. " To tell the truth, our break- 
fast is slim ; I can't afford meat, and Mr. Lennox usu- 
ally has an egg or two ; he never cares, fortunately, for 
a heavy breakfast, but prefers knick-knacks." 

" This is the sort of housekeeping Harry dreaded," 
thought Molly, but she said aloud, " Then you would 
really spend $2.35 this morning for meat to last till 
Tuesday .? " 

*' At the very least, but more likely $2.75, for they 
could hardly cut me exactly eight pounds." 

" Then I would suggest you get, instead of the roast, 
either a leg of mutton at 15 cents a pound, or a piece 
of beef at the same price for a la mode beef ; and if you 
choose the mutton, then you will have a really nice pot- 
pie to-night in place of chops. You will find that you 
will buy ten pounds of meat for $1.50, and then you can 
get some of the knick-knacks Mr. Lennox likes foi 
breakfast.'* 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 55 

" But he won't look at cold mutton, or Irish stew- 
made of it." 

" No ; Irish stew needs fresh meat, and cold mutton 
is not appetizing ; but I propose your having hot mutton 
each meal." 

" But that will make so much cooking, and I am 
alone to do it ! " 

'' I know," said Molly, gently, " but I am sure that 
sewing-machine is half killing you ; can't you give it up 
for an hour or two each day ? " 

" My dear, by the time I get through my housework 
it is near noon ; then there 's the children's dinner to 
get and clear, and I don't get to sewing till after one. 
Then the afternoon and evening I have to give to it ; if 
I could go and buy new material I need not have half 
the work, but it is the cutting down, making over, rip- 
ping, altering, and planning that wears one out." 

"Then I will help you," said Molly. "I have time, 
and if you '11 promise to give one hour to the kitchen, 
I '11 sew an hour with you and cook an hour. I am so 
sure the change of work will brighten you up." 

" Heaven knows I need brightening ! I feel a perfect 
hag, and I 'm only twenty-eight." 

" Then you accept ? " 

" Yes," hesitating ; " yet I don't know why I can al- 
low you to " — 

" Oh, don't say one word ! I love it." 

Tliey had slackened pace in their earnest talk, but 
now they had reached the butcher's. 

" You are to order just what you like," said Mrs. 
Lennox. 

"I will." 

Molly chose a good-sized leg of mutton, weighing 
eight pounds, and told the butcher to cut it nearly in 
half, leaving the large part for the loin end ; and a pound 
and half of round steak. She ordered also half a pound 
of beef suet; then, turning to Mrs. Lennox, she asked 
if Mr. Lennox was fond of kidneys for breakfast ? 

" I believe he is."

" "Well, I count myself nearly a dollar in pocket so 
far," said Mrs. Lennox, " but I have tried buying eco- 
nomical meats before, though in the end it was no econ- 
omy, for we did not eat it." 

*' I will forgive you if you don't eat this," said Molly, 
laughing ; " but I must hurry home ; I have a chicken 
pie to make for to-morrow's dinner, but I will see you 
later in the day. I am responsible, you know, for the 
meat I have bought." 

Molly's own dinner being soup, veal cutlets, potato 
croquettes, Lima beans, and apple pudding, and the 
soup read}^, all but heating it, she meant to make the 
pudding and prepare the croquettes, and leave Marta to 
her own resources for the vegetables and breading cut- 
lets, — she, herself, would be back in time to see the 
actual cooking of her own meat. But of her own cook- 
ing I will speak in the next chapter. 

At three o'clock, then, Molly went over to Mrs. 
Lennox, whom she found busy feather-stitching several 
yards of navy blue cashmere ruffling with red crewel. 

" This is for Milly's fall frock ; it was first my dress, 
then Lily's, now it comes to Milly, and the red will 
make a change." 

" You have far more patience than I," said Molly. 

"Yes, I don't know what I should do without it. 
Must the cooking begin now ? I hate to lose daylight." 

"Yes, the pot-pie will take long, slow cooking to be 
good, but you can come back in half an hour." 

*' Oh ! suppose we have that steak fried — just for to- 
day ; well pounded it will be tender enough. I hate to 
leave this."

" I will go down, then, if you will let one of the little 
girls show me where you keep things." 

" Oh, no, I can't let you ! " said Mrs. Lennox. " But 
that is just it ; don't you see yourself I have no time to 
cook?" 

Molly longed to say that it seemed as important to 
her that the food should be well prepared as that the 
flounce should be feather-stitched, but of course, she said 
nothing, and the next minute they were down in Mrs. 
Lennox's neat kitchen. 

"This pot-pie I propose making is an English dish 
my father was very fond of, and it is a little different 
from our dish of that name." 

" This is very kind of you, Mrs. Bishop. I only fear 
you will see what an up-hill business it is to make a 
family live well on very little money." 

" What do you call little ? " asked Molly, busily cut- 
ting the steak into finger-lengths. 

" $80 a month to keep six people, and out of it $20 
for rent ; that leaves sixty for everything else." 

Molly thought that was not too little to insure a 
plain, solid comfort, but she must gain Mrs. Lennox's 
confidence in her ability and good-will before telling 
her so, and she went on quietly preparing for the pot- 
pie. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

BEEF POT-PIE LEG OF MUTTON TWO ROASTS 

SEVERAL WHOLESOME ECONOMICAL DISHES. 

When Molly had cut the steak into finger-lengths, 
she floured the pieces lightly, and put an iron saucepan 
that held about three quarts on the stove, and, when it 
was hot, dropped in the fat of the steak, then the meat, 
and left them to fry at the bottom of the saucepan. 

" I should thiuk that would burn," said Mrs. Lennox. 

" No, because the meat fat is there ; but it has to 
brown very quickly, or the meat will be hard ; that 
is why I let the saucepan get so hot. Now I want a 
carrot, an onion, and a turnip — all of medium size." 

" I have only small onions." 

'' Two of those, then." 

Molly washed and then began to peel them — the 
turnip thick, the carrot very thin. 

" What can / do ? " asked Mrs. Lennox. 

'' You can chop that suet very fine, taking away all 
skin and veins." 

Molly cut the vegetables into slices a quarter of an 
inch thick, made piles of half a dozen slices of carroL 
then cut across them at even distances ; it was more 
quickly done than the usual hit or miss way, and they 
looked far better ; the turnip she did the same, and then 
she stirred the meat round, which was sending a savory 
odor through the house. The peeled onion she dropped 
into water, aud then, with hands still in the water, cut it 
across at equal distances all the way through, then across 
again. 

" What are you doing that in water for ? " 

" It prevents the odor clinging so much to the hands, 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 59 

and also mitigates its power to make me weep." As 
she spoke she took all the vegetables to the saucepan, 
dropped them in and stirred them quickly round, then 
poured two kitchen cups of boiling water on the whole, 
and seasoned it with a tea-spoonful of salt and a quarter 
one of pepper. 

" I want to watch that come to the boil, and then put 
it where it will just simmer." 

She had covered the saucepan close, and then turned 
to Mrs. Lennox. The suet in her unaccustomed hands 
was still far from being chopped fine, and the warmth of 
the kitchen had made it clog together. Molly said, " If 
suet gets soft while being chopped, shake a little flour 
into it, also flour the chopping-knife. When chopping it 
in winter for mincemeat, I let it get well frozen." She 
chopped vigorously as she spoke, and it was soon so 
fine as to look like tapioca. She then turned to the 
saucepan, which had reached the boiling-point, and drew 
it aside, carefully changing the position until it just 
simmered. She then pointed out to Mrs. Lennox the 
little sizzling round the edge of the saucepan, barely 
perceptible, and told her that it should cook no faster." 

" But that does n't appear to be cooking at all.'' 

" Oh, yes ! and meat stewed so will always be tender. 
If you like we can go to the sewing now, as it is too 
soon to make the crust." 

She went upstairs and sewed till five o'clock, chat- 
ting the while, Mrs. Lennox expatiating on the pri- 
vations of the w^hole family ; and Molly could well 
understand how it came about, with a poor, weary 
mother sewing strenuously to make the children look 
well, and understanding so little of domestic economy 
that she did not see that, by a different mode of living, 
she would save enough in the month either to buy new 
clothes or to lessen her own incessant labor by getting 
help. Nor could Molly at this time make any sugges- 
tion. 

At five o'clock Molly took a cup of the suet, and a 
scant two cups of flour, with a level tea-spoonful of salt,

tossed all together in a bowl, then made a hole in the 
centre, and poured in half a cup of cold water, quickly and 
lightly made it into a dough with a knife, adding a few 
drops of water to bind the crumbs ; there was no pres- 
sure, no attempt at kneading, and the dough was soft, 
but not sticky ; then she turned it on the floured pastry- 
board, and rolled it quickly ; it formed a fairly good 
round shape, an inch thick, and somewhat larger than 
the top of the saucepan. She laid it on the top of the 
meat aud vegetables, after tasting the gravy to see if it 
was seasoned enough. 

"You see it forms a sort of lid to the stew, which 
must now be put forward, as the cold crust has cooled it, 
till it boils again, or the crust will be heavy." She 
placed it in the hottest spot as she spoke. 

" But do you mean to say that crust will be light with- 
out baking powder ? " 

" Yes, quite light ; if it is made quickly, rolled only 
once — just as you would biscuit dough, only not so soft 
— brought quickly to the boiling-point when in the sauce- 
pan, and then kept gently simmering an hour, not allowed 
to soak in the gravy without cooking. But if you choose 
you can add bakinj^-powder ; it makes a much more 
crumbly crust. Made as I have made it, it is considered 
very wholesome and nourishing, as beef fat and wheaten 
flour are two of the best kinds of food ; lard and flour 
and baking-powder are by no means so wholesome a 
combination. When dishing it, cut the top crust pie- 
fashion, and lay it round the meat." 

" Well, ' the proof of the pudding is in the eating,' 
and if it is fairly good I shall be so glad to have some 
dish that is a change from our routine, and it is, after all, 
easy enough," said Mrs. Lennox, washing potatoes for 
the oven. 

" Oh, quite ! It only needs strict attention to the little 
points, the slow simmering and the seasoning ; the 
browning at first is not necessary, although it is bet- 
ter looking and better flavored by taking that little 
trouble." 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 61 

" Ah, my dear, it is the little trouble, that seems noth- 
ing to you, that makes so much difference to a busy 
woman like me." 

" If you like this dish, I have several others that I 
think you may find both very cheap and very nice, and 
I shall be very glad at any time to come over and give 
you a hel[)ing hand in the kitchen. And, by and bye, 
this suet crust is the foundation for several good pud- 
dings, — rolled out and spread with jam, and boiled one 
hour and a half as a roly-poly, it is excellent ; with a 
cup of currants added, before wetting the flour and suet, 
it makss the ' spotted Dick ' dear to English children ; 
or, in place of currants, the juice of a lemon and the 
grated rind of two, with half a cup of sugar, makes a 
nice plain lemon pudding, but long, steady ])oiIing is ab- 
solutely necessary to lightness. Excuse my telling you 
all this, but you know I am so fond of cooking, I can't 
help it." 

" I am much obli<:ed. I like to hear all about it, even 
if I can't make the things." 

" Now about that leg of mutton : I propose you roast 
the loin end to-morrow, and there will be a little left 
cold, which you will not use on Monday, but cook 
the other half — have it boiled, with caper sauce, or 
roasted." 

" I will boil it, for that is a dish we all like ; only what 
to do with cold boiled mutton I don't know ; that is why, 
though we like it, we never have it." 

"Tuesday, you will have tlie remains of the Sunday 
roast and the remains of Monday's boiled mutton, and I 
will run in and show you how to make a nice dish of 
them ; but be sure to boil the half leg in only just enouijh 
water, and very slowly, and keep the bi-oth ; if you boil 
a turnip and onion with it, it will be all the better for 
broth and meat." 

" Thank you ; that sounds like a great improvement 
on hot meat Sunday and cold Monday and Tuesday. 
What about that kidney ? I have n't an idea how to 
cook it." 



62 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" Soak it in salt and water an hour ; cut it in pieces 
half an inch thick, leaving out the core ; flour them ; put 
them in a saucepan with half a table-spoonful of butter 
and a thin slice of onion, unless it is disliked ; let them 
fry five minutes, then add half a tea-cup of boihng water, 
and stand the saucepan where it will just simmer ten 
minutes — if you leave it longer the kidney will be hard. 
I like to have it served on toast, but that is optional ; 
only be sure it is served as soon as cooked, and with 
quite hot plates." 

'• Thank you ever so much. Mr. Lennox will enjoy 
his breakfast, I 've no doubt." 

" I hope you will, too," said Molly. 

" I dare say I shall, thanks to you." 

Molly hurried home, for she had her own dinner to 
attend to ; and to-night she was going to look over her 
accounts and convince Harry that '' Ten Dollars " is 
'* Enough " to pay all the weekly expenses they would 
be likely to incur. 



CHAPTER IX. 

VEAL CUTLETS, BREADED. 

When Molly reached home it was nearly six. Marta 
had followed directions fairly well, but Molly had taken 
the precaution to do everything she could before leav- 
ing home. She had herself cut half the veal cutlets into 
neat pieces, the size of a large oyster, leaving the rest 
for her pie, pounded each, squeezed on it a few drops 
of lemon juice, and piled one upon the other, and told 
Marta to leave them so an hour or two, then bread them 
exactly as she had done the lamb chops. She had also 
cut some thiii slices of breakfast bacon, taken off the 
rind and dark inner skin very thinly ; and now, having 
let the frying-pan get quite hot, she put the bacon in it. 
As soon as it looked clear she turned it ; it curled up, 
and when it had been in the pan about three minutes 
she took it out and laid in the cutlets ; the half a dozen 
pieces left room to turn them about comfortably. 

"You see, Marta, I don't drop these into deep fat, 
because veal is a meat that requires long cooking, and is 
one of the few things I think better fried, or rather 
' saute,' in this way, with only enough fat to cook them, 
but it is much more Irouble to do than the frying in 
boiling fat." 

The cutlets took nearly ten minutes to fry a nice 
brown on one side, because, although the pan was kept 
at a good heat, she had to guard against burning.' 
Then eacfr piece was turned, and, when quite brown (it 
took nearly ten minutes more to get so), taken up and 
put on the dish, and the bacon round it. Molly took 
the pan to the table, poured off the fat, which was dark, 
and put in the pan a dessert-spoonful of butter and a 



64 ^ TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

scant one of flour, set them on the stove and let them 
melt and brown a little ; then she drew the pan aside, 
and poured a small cup of the hot soup they were going 
to have for dinner into it, and stirred till smooth, mash- 
ing all the brown clinging gravy with the back of her 
spoon. She explained to Marta that, it" the soup had 
not been at hand, water and pepper and salt would have 
been used ; or, if there was oyster liquor in the house, 
she should have used that and water in equal parts. 

" Now^ take in the soup, Marta, — and while that is on 
the table, let this gravy boil a few seconds, then pour it 
through the strainer into the dish with the cutlets ; don't 
let it boil longer, or it will get too thick." 

After dinner, Harry told Molly that one of the gen- 
tlemen on the cars, a friend of the Winiields', had spoken 
to him about joining a dramatic reading-club, of which 
he was president, and said his wife was coming to invite 
Molly. " But I don't think we can afford it, dear." 

" Would you like it ? " asked Molly quickly. 

" Oh, I don't know ! Yes, I think it might brighten 
the winter a bit." 

" Well, we will see after my accounts are audited. 
First, I want to ask you how you consider you have 
fared this week ? " 

" Admirably, — so well that I 'm afraid of the ac- 
counts." 

"You need not be. Now I want you to listen while 
I read over the bills of fare for the week." 

Harry nodded in amused good humor, and smoked on 
comfortably. 

" On Monday we had chicken salad, etc., for lunch. 
Dinner — Roast shoulder of lamb, potatoes, cabbage, 
macaroni, tomato salad, and peaches and cream. 

"Tuesday. Breakfast — Breaded chops, baked po- 
tatoes, corn muffins." 

Harry nodded assent to each item as Molly turned 
her bright eyes on him to make sure he was giving at- 
tention. 

" Tuesday. Dinner — Oysters, steak, ragout of 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. ^r 65 

lamb, stuffed potatoes, Lima beans, cheese canapees, and 
lemon pie. 

" Wednesday. Breakfast — Hashed lamb, poached 
colors, and souffle bread. Dinner — Tomato cream soup, 
roast breast of lamb, chicken croquettes, stewed onions 
and potatoes, peach pudding. 

" Thursday. Breakfast — Lamb chops broiled, eggs, 
tomato salad, stewed potatoes, muffins. Dinner — Fried 
smelts, beef a la mode, cones of carrots and turnips, 
mashed potatoes, lettuce salad, cheese fritters, amber 
pudding. 

"Friday. Breakfast — Brown hash, poached eggs, 
corn bread, baked potatoes. Dinner — Bisque of clams, 
beef au gratin, chicken rissoles, cauliflower, potatoes, 
tomato salad, custard pie. 

" Saturday. Breakfast — Scalloped clams, cauli- 
flower, omelet, pop-overs, stewed potatoes. Dinner — 
Clear soup, veal cutlets, mashed potatoes, cabbage, maca- 
roni, apple pudding. 

" And to-morrow's breakfast and dinner, though not 
eaten, is paid for, so I add that. 

" Sunday. Breakfast — Broiled bacon, poached eggs, 
muffins. Dinner — Clear soup, chicken pie, mashed 
potatoes, creamed onions, tomato salad, peach compote, 
and custard." 

Molly concluded her list with rather a triumphant air, 
as one who knows she has achieved what she set out 
to do. 

" Yes, Molly, we have had all those good breakfasts 
and dinners, and I 'm afraid to think oj the work you 
have had to cook all that. Let me look at your poor 
little hands." 

She held them towards him. They were white and 
soft as ever. 

"Nevertheless," he said, pressing them between his 
own, "I feel such a selfish brute to let you do it." 

" Nonsense ! I like it. Why, did n't I always go to 
Mrs. Welles' house after each cooking-lesson, and re- 
peat the whole lesson, when I had n't the satisfaction 
5 



66 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

of seeing you share the good things I made, because we 
were boarding ? And did n't she and I repeat every 
failure until we got it right? Those were the days when 
I had backaches and headaches, because I was so anxious 
to succeed and failed so often ; but now it is all at my 
fingers' ends, and no more trouble than the simplest 
cooking — far less, indeed ; it takes a little more time 
and makes more washing-up for Marta ; and if we had a 
large family and I had other duties, I could not give so 
much time ; nor would it be right to overwork one girl 
to cater to our tastes ; but in a tiny house like this, with 
two or even four people, there 's no question of overwork 
for either mistress or maid." 

" But even your time, dear, ought n't to be sacrificed 
to give me good dinners." 

*' No, nor will it be ; but what is my time good for, 
except to make your income go as far as it will ? I get 
all the time to read I want ; I am not fond of plain sew- 
ing ; and as clothes ready made can now be bought so 
good and cheap, I don't mean to do more than keep the 
buttons sewed on," — here she smiled as she thought of 
the favorite grievance, — " the stockings well darned, and 
everything mended ; so you '11 never have the satisfaction 
of seeing me stitch long white seams, nor wear a shirt 
made by me." 

" Thank heaven ! " ejaculated Harry. 

"No, nowadays that I consider real waste of time. 
And then I've no gift for fancy work, pretty as the 
modern version of it is, so I'd like to know what I 
should do with tUe whole day if I did n't do something in 
the kitchen ? I expect, when Marta is trained, never to 
spend more than an hour and a half each day there, and 
an hour besides for the other little household duties ; that 
leaves a margin for visiting, reading, and the sewing I 
may have." 

" Very well, Molly dear ; that programme sounds very 
easy, but whether it works in practice I don't know." 

" Everything depends on Marta, — if she shows intel- 
ligence and cares to learn, thnigs will go as I have 
planned after the first month ; but supposing she actu- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 67 

ally never proves capable of doing the cooking alone, I 
shall simply make up my mind to spend the hour be- 
tween five and six every day in the kitchen. I shan't 
like to do it, because it ought not to be necessary, but 
one has to accept some shortcoming with any servant, 
and I would sooner this than some others ; but to make 
it worth while to keep her under those circumstances, 
she must be y^tj good in other things. There ! I 'm 
talking instead of attending to business," said Molly ; 
" here is an account of our expenditure."

Molly had added to the supplies she had ordered for

$9.86, the following articles :

which brought the amount to $11.22; one fourth of 
which, $2.80, added to $7.19, made the week's expend- 
iture $9.99. 

" Now, although that amount has been spent this 
week, you must remember that of several of the articles 
bought, a little is left, and I have not to begin this week 
without a scrap in the house as I had the last," explained 
Molly. " We need ice only a week or two longer, but 
when that need ceases we shall require more fuel ; but I 
think a dollar a week all the year round will average ice 
and fuel, so I shall allow that. We shall use $2 a week 
for a few weeks, but barely 50 cents the rest of the 
year." 

Molly laid the accounts before her husband as she fin- 
ished, and he gravely looked them over. 

" And if, this month, I come out even five cents a- 
head, we may count ourselves safe, for buying in the 
very small quantities I am now doing is an extravagant 
way. But 1 wanted to make sure my ' paper housekeep- 
ing' would work in practice." 

There was rather an anxious look in Harry's eyes as 
he read over the accounts. He was afraid Molly had 
sadly miscalculated, and he hated to prove her at fault, 
although he loved to poke fun at her. 

"What's the matter?" asked his wife, starting up 
and looking over his shoulder. 

" Only, dear, if you remember, we had chicken in one 
form or other several times this week, but there is only 
one chicken counted, and that is to-day. Also lamb 
chops we have had several times." He glanced up at 
her deprecatingly, for he felt such criticism ungracious, 
yet necessary ; but Molly was quite serene. 

" The box of chicken in Monday's bill was all I 've 
used ; the chops also were from Monday. There 's one 
thing, though, I will call your attention to, and that is, 
that the most expensive meal we have had was the steak, 
yet people who use steak every day are supposed to live 
•plainly and economically.'' 

" Then we come out wonderfully, I acknowledge." 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 69 

" This week, of course, Marta has simply seen how I 
want things done ; next week I want her to actually do 
the cooking from recipes. Do you think you can stand 
last week's dinners all over again ?" 

" Of course, my dear ; why not ? " 

" That 's well, because if I teach her new things be- 
fore she has learnt these thoroughly, she will get con- 
fused. I want to feel that there are a few things I can 
absolutely trust her to do. Then I can go on to fresh 
fields, so you may have things that are ditficult to cook 
rather oftener than I like, till Marta is capable." 

" I shall not object to aid in Marta's education so far," 
said Harry. 



CHAPTER X. 

DETAILS OF MOLLY'S MANAGEMENT — RECIPES. 

Molly had not entered so fully into matters with 
Harry as she would have done had he been a woman ; 
but as this story is to tell, not only what Molly did, but 
how she did it, I must be a little more explicit. 

She found herself on Wednesday with a breast of 
lamb, eight chops, half a box of boned chicken, and a 
small piece of steak. The chops were good for two 
breakfasts ; the chicken, prepared as for croquettes, 
would make either eight of those, or three croquettes, 
three rissoles, and some fritters. Now, as eight cro- 
quettes for two people would be waste, since they were 
only an entree^ the main dinner being something else, 
she had no idea of that, but rissoles, fritters and cro- 
quettes being all prepared alike, and keeping better in 
that way, she made the mixture, and used enough for 
the three croquettes, leaving the rest in the ice-box for 
use another day. Part of the chops she would not want 
to use till the end of the week, and keeping them quite 
sweet she made all the fat that had come from the lamb 
(dripping and trimmings, etc.) boiling hot, then laid the 
chops in it — seethed them, as it were — for one min- 
ute, then put them away with the coat of fat on them, 
to be scraped off when they were to be cooked. 

For the clam soup a pint and a half was all that was 
needed, and the liquor, with half the clams, was all that 
she used ; the rest she scalloped for breakfast. 

It was in making no more of each dish than they could 
eat (but allowing plenty for kitchen as well as dining- 
room) that Molly was able to have what seemed a sur- 
prising table, — that and one other thing, allowing noth- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 71 

ing whatever to be wasted. The piece of steak left from 
Tuesday's dinner was fag end ; it was put away, and when 
the hash was made for Friday morning from the remains 
of a la mode beef, the steak was just the thing to add 
to it. 

For lunch there had always been enough in the house 
from dinner the night before. As it was her plan to put 
Marta more on her own responsibility the following week, 
she had prepared for that purpose the recipes of the 
principal things ; and as Marta's mistakes and difficulties 
might occur to others, the working of them out in her 
hands will be more instructive than recounting Molly's 
certain success. 

The recipes were as follows : — 

Hashed Lamb. — The remains of ragout of lamb, 
freed from bone, chopped with the vegetables, the gravy, 
and a tea-spoouful of butter and one of Worcestershire 
sauce added ; the whole made boiling hot, and served on 
fried bread. 

Souffle Bread. — Two eggs, two table-spoonfuls of 
flour, in which half a tea-spoonful of baking-powder is 
sifted ; beat yolks and a table-spoonful of butter, melted, 
together, then add flour 2JiAjust milk enough to make a 
very thick batter ; add a pinch of salt and a tea-spoonful 
of sugar ; whip whites of eggs to a firm froth, and stir 
gently in. Have ready a small iron spider (or earthen 
pan is still better), made hot, with a dessert-spoonful of 
butter also hot, but not so hot as for frying ; pour the 
mixture, which should be like sponge-cake batter, into 
the pan, cover with a lid or tin plate, and set it back of 
the stove if the fire is good — if slow, it may be quite 
forward. When well risen, almost like omelet soufl[ie, 
set it in the oven five minutes to brown the top ; if the 
oven is cool, you may very carefully turn it, so as not to 
deaden it ; serve when done, under side uppermost. It 
should be a fine golden brown. 

Souffle bread may be baked in a thick tin, with 
rather more butter than enough to grease it, but the 
oven must be very hot indeed, and it should be covered 
till thoroughly puffed up, then allowed to brown. 



72 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 

Tomato Cream Soup. — Put six ripe tomatoes on 
to stew ; when done, boil one pint of milk in a double 
boiler, mix two tea-spoonfuls (large) of flour with very 
little milk till smooth, then stir it into the boiling milk; 
cook ten minutes. To the tomato put a salt-spoonful, 
scant, of soda, stir well, then rub through a strainer fine 
enough to keep back seeds ; add a dessert-spoonful of 
butter to the milk, stirring well, then the tomato, and 
serve immediately. 

Breast of Lamb Roasted. — Take out the bones 
with a small, sharp knife; put them on to boil with a 
piece of carrot and a slice of onion, a pint of water and 
a bay leaf ; boil for two hours till reduced to less than 
half. Eoll the breast (it may be seasoned with pepper, 
salt and chopped parsley before rolling) and skewer it, 
then brush it over with egg and roll in cracker crumbs ; 
bake in a good oven an hour and a half, basting often. 
It should be very well browned, but not burnt. When 
done take it up, put a dessert-spoonful of butter in the 
pan, which set on the stove, then add a scant one of 
flour; let them brown together, stirring the while; 
strain to it the gravy from the bones, stirring quickly to 
prevent lumps, season to taste, add a tea-spoonful of 
lemon juice or vinegar, and pour round the meat. 

Chicken Croquettes. — Half a box of boned 
chicken, or half a chicken ; chop it fine, flavor with a 
few mushrooms, or a little oyster liquor, or oysters 
chopped, or a very little ham, or simply a piece of on- 
ion as large as a hazel-nut, scalded and chopped very 
fine, and a tea-spoonful of fnely chopped parsley. In 
flavoring this (and other dishes) take advantage of what 
may be in the house suitable. Put a table-spoonful of 
butter in a small saucepan with a table-spoonful of flour, 
stir till they bubble, then put into a half-pint measure a 
gill of strong stock made from bones (Molly had bruised 
up the bones from the shoulder of lamb and boiled 
them down) and, if you have it, a gill of cream or 
milk (unless you have oyster or mushroom liquor, when 
half a gill of cream), and fill up with either of them

(the liquid, of whatever kind, must be just half a pint 
to this quantity) ; pour this on the butter and flour, an^? 
stir till it forms a thick, smooth sauce ; boil five minutes, 
season highly, and then mix the chicken with it ; stir to- 
gether, and pour it out on a plate, and put it to get quite 
cold and firm. If no stock is used, an egg must be 
stirred into the sauce, moving it a few seconds from the 
fire before adding it, or it will curdle. When it is cold 
and stiff, put plenty of cracker meal on a board, beat an 
egg with a table-spoonful of water, cut the chicken mix- 
ture into strips, roll it between the hands into shapes like 
wine corks, no larger, put each one into the egg, then 
into the cracker meal, taking care the egg has covered 
every part and the meal coats it thoroughly. As each is 
done, lay it on a plate of cracker meal. They may be 
prepared an hour or two before they are needed. To fry 
them, the fat must be so hot that bread dropped into it 
will color well in thirty seconds ; arrange a few at a time 
in a frying basket, set it in the hot fat ; two minutes 
will make them golden brown ; if left longer, or made 
too large, they will burst. 

Rissoles. — Take a little fine paste, — any trimmings 
will do, — roll it as thin as paper, cut it into squares three 
inches by four, lay on each a strip as thick as your finger 
of the chicken mixture, and roll up, wetting the edges of 
the paste and pressing together, so that there will be no 
oozing out ; egg and crumb the same as croquettes, and 
try four minutes. 

Chicken Fritters. — Make some good batter thus : 
a cup of flour sifted ; melt a table-spoonful of butter 
in a scant cup of warm water, which pour by degrees to 
the flour, making a batter thick enough to mask the back 
of a spoon dipped in it ; salt to taste ; add, the last thing, 
the white of an egg well beaten. Make the chicken 
mixture into balls the size of small walnuts, flatten a 
little, dip into the batter, and drop from the spoon into 
very hot fat, the same as croquettes. 

Peach Pudding. — A cup of flour, one tea-spoonful 
of baking-powder sifted in it; make into a very thick bat- 



74 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

ter with three parts of a cup of milk, beat tvro eggs very 
light with a quarter cup of sugar, acid a pinch of Sf»\t, 
mix, and then stir in as many cut-up peaches as you can ; 
butter a bowl throughly, nearly fill with the mixture, tie 
a cloth over it, and plunge mio fast boiling water; boil 
one hour, taking care that ebullition never ceases while 
the pudding is in the saucepan, or it will be soggy. 
Serve with cream, or soft custard, or hard sauce. 

Peach Fritters are made by the same recipe, but 
dropped by the spoonful in boiling lard. 

Fried Smelts. — Cleanse and dry them, then dip 
them in milk, then in flour ; shake off superfluous flour, 
and then egg and crumb them the same as chops, laying 
each flsh when done on a bed of cracker meal. Make 
the lard as hot as for croquettes, and drop them in five 
or six at a time. If the lard is hot enough they will 
brown in two minutes. 

Beef X la IMode. — Three pounds of the vein or 
any coarse part of ^beef that is solid meat, and half a 
pound of fat pork. Pierce the meat in several ]3laces 
with a knife, and into each hole thus made put a strip of 
pork ; lay the beef in an earthen pan, with a bay leaf, a 
sprig of thyme, four sprigs of parsley, two onions, me- 
dium size, with a clove stuck in each, half a blade of 
mace, half a carrot and turnip, a wine-glass of cooking- 
sherry, and a gallon of water, with half a salt-spoonful of 
pepper. The pan should not be much larger than the 
meat. Cover closely, using a common flour and water 
paste round the edges to prevent the steam escaping, 
and set in a good oven three hours. The wine may be 
omitted, and a wine-glass more water added, with a 
table-spoonful of Worcestershire sauce and half one of 
vinegar. When done, take up the meat carefully, strain 
the gravy, skim and season, and pour it over the meat. 
Don't add the salt till the gravy is done, as pork varies 
so much that you may get it too salt with very little 
added; you must go by taste. 

Cones of Carrots and Turnips. — Boil them sep- 
arately in quarters, using white turnips ; chop each fine 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 75 

in a chopping-bowl, put a dessert-spoonful of butter with 
them, season with white pepper and salt, then press 
them into a cone shape — a wine-glass will answer — 
and stand them in alternate cones of the yellow carrot and 
white turnips round the beef a la mode or corned beef. 

Cheese Fritters. — Grate two ounces of cheese 
with two dessert-spoonfuls of bread crumbs, a half tea- 
spoonful of dry mustard, a dessert-spoonful of butter, a 
speck of cayenne, and the yolk of an egg ; pound with 
a potato-masher till smooth and well mixed, then pro- 
ceed as for chicken fritters. 

Amber Pudding. — Two eggs, their weight in 
sugar, butter, flour, and the juice and grated peel of one 
lemon. Beat the yolks, with the sugar, lemon juice, 
and butter softened, till very light ; sift in the flour and 
grated peel, butter a small bowl or mould, pour the mix- 
ture in and boil two hours. 

Bisque of Clams. — For one pint and a half of 
soup take a dozen large clams ; stew them fifteen min- 
utes in their own liquor, to which water is added to 
make three gills. Boil three gills of milk ; stir one des- 
sert-spoonful of butter and one of flour in a small sauce- 
pan till they bubble ; then pour the boiling milk quickly 
on them, stirring all the while ; stand it aside. Squeeze 
each clam with a lemon-squeezer, and you will find little 
but an empty skin remains ; strain the clams and liquor 
to the thick white sauce already made, pressing as much 
juice out as possible ; then stir well, bring all to a boil, 
and remove from the fire while you beat the yolk of an 
egg with two table-spoonfuls of the soup; stir it to the 
rest and season to taste. Take care the soup is boiling 
hot, yet does not boil after the egg is added, or it will 
curdle. 

Scalloped Clams. — Take a small cup of the bisque 
of clams, before the egg is added, and save it for the 
scallop. Scald ten or a dozen clams, cut out the hard 
part, chop the rest fine. Butter tin scallop shells or lit- 
tle saucers thickly, strew them with bread crumbs, put a 
layer of clams with pepper, a layer of crumbs, and

enougli of the soup to moisten them ; then more clams, 
more pepper, and crumbs over the "top. and then a thin 
covering of the soup, and bake a rich brown. Serve a 
cat lemon with them. Be careful not to get too much 
soup on them, — they should be moist, not wet, and be 
served very hot. Add a little salt if the clams are not 
salt enough, but it is seldom necessary. 

Cauliflower Omelet. — Two eggs, a half cup of 
cold cauliflower with the sauce ; mash the cauliflower 
and sauce, beat the yolks of eggs with it, then beat the 
whites till they will not slip from the dish, and stir them 
gently, in ; add pepper and salt, and fry as any other 
omelet. 

As Molly had given minute directions to Marta for 
frying omelet already, she did not repeat them in her 
recipes. When Molly had made the brown hash for 
breakfast, she had laid aside some of the nicest slices of 
the cold a la mode beef and the gravy for 

Beef au Gratin. — Put a laj^er of bread crumbs in 
a small dish, then a layer of fat pork cut thin as a wafer, 
then a layer of beef, on which strew a very little chopped 
onion and parsley, pepper and salt ; then another layer 
of the shaved pork, more beef, and cover the top with 
bread crumbs ; over all pour gravy enough to moisten it 
well, and bake slowly one hour. 

Custard Pie. — Line the dish with light paste 
(Molly used what was left after making the lemon pie, 
— puff paste will keep a week in the ice-box), beat one 
egg, mix with a small cup of milk and one table-spoon- 
ful of sugar, pour it into the pie, grate nutmeg over, and 
bake in an oven that is very hot on the bottom. 

Clear Soup. — Three pounds of soup-meat, or a 
soup-bone weighing that ; gash the meat well and put to 
it three quarts of cold water and three tea-spoonfuls of 
salt, half one of jDepper, one small carrot, one turnip, 
one large onion — each must weigh three ounces o/Zer 
'peelijig ; stick one clove in the onion, cut the vegeta- 
bles, and when the meat has slowly boiled two hours, 
add the vegetables and cook three hours more. By 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 77 

slow boiling is meant just an occasional bubble in the 
centre of the pot. Skim just as the meat comes to the' 
boil, then throw in half a cup of cold water ; take off the 
scum that will now rise rapidly, adding a little cold 
water ao^ain when it bea^ins to boil. Skim aijain after 
the vegetables are in, and when done, strain. When 
cold, take off the fat ; don't shake the soup, but pour 
through a clean cloth, all but the sediment, which keep 
to make gravy. It must never boil fast, or it will be 
cloudy and taste poor. There will be two quarts and a 
pint of fine, clear soup, if the boiling has been so slow 
as to waste very little. 

Chicken Pie. — Put the neck, gizzard, and feet, 
scalded, of a chicken in nearly a pint of water with a 
SQiall spoonful of salt and a slice of onion and a piece of 
carrot as big as your thumb. Let them stew sloivly till 
there is not more than a gill of liquid, which strain and 
put aside ; when cold it will be hard jelly. Lay in the 
bottom of a deep oval dish that holds rather more than 
three quarts, about half a pound of veal cutlet (or beef- 
steak if you prefer) finely chopped across, yet not made 
into sausage-meat; sprinkle on it a scant salt-spoonful of 
salt and a little pepper, shave nice sweet salt pork and 
put a thin layer of that ; then put in the chicken, neatly 
divided into small joints, sprinkling each with a little 
salt and pepper, and always pile toward the centre ; 
when full add forcemeat balls made thus : Chop very 
finely a heaped tea-spoonful of parsley, rub a scant salt- 
spoonful of thyme leaves to fine powder (this is easily 
done if they are put to stand in a hot place a few min- 
utes before rubbing, taking care they do not burn), add 
to them a tea-cup of fine bread crumbs and just one 
grate of nutmeg, the nutmeg drawn sharply once up and 
down the grater; chop into this a good tea-spoonlul of 
butter, and wet all with the yolk of an e^g ; now add a 
little salt and pepper, tasting to see when there is 
enough; make into little round balls and drop into the 
pie wherever there is a chink, and pour over all half a 
cup of water. Now roll out some rough puff paste 



78 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

(made as for lemon pie), cut strips half an inch thick 
and two broad, wet the edges of the dish and lay this 
round lightly. If the chicken is packed in the shape of 
a dome it will slope from the sides, and the paste can be 
pressed round the inside edge to make it adhere to the 
dish ; wet it slightly, then roll the paste for a cover 
half an inch thick ; lay it on, press, with your forefinger 
laid flat to form a groove between the chicken and the 
dish, so that the inner edge of the under paste adheres 
to the upper one ; don't press the outer edge at all ; trim 
round with a sharp knife, make a good-sized hole in the 
centre and ornament with twisted paste, or as you 
choose ; brush all over with white of egg (not the edges, 
or they will not rise) and bake an hour and a quarter in 
a good steady oven. Before it is cold, pour the gravy 
made from giblets through the hole in the top, using a 
funnel for the purpose. This pie is excellent cold, but 
if made the day before using, when made hot it will 
take quite half an hour to heat through. Lay a paper 
over to protect the crust. 



CHAPTER XI. 

WHAT TO DO WITH A SOUP-BONE. 

** I don't think there is anymore painful fact con- 
nected with a small income than one's inability to do 
anything for the distress one hears of," said Harry as 
he chipped an egg at breakfast on Sunday morning. 

" I feel that too, very keenly ; but are you thinking of 
any special instance ? " 

" Yes, a poor fellow was killed a few weeks ago on 
the track here, and he left a delicate wife and three little 
children. They were taking up a collection in the cars 
for her yesterday. I contributed my mite, of course ; but 
what are a few dollars in a case like that? They say he 
had been out of work for weeks before he got the em- 
ployment that led to his death, and that if some more 
permanent help does not reach them, they will be near 
starvation this winter." 

" Oh, surely not, certainly not, if people only know 
of the distress ; each one will do a little, and so very lit- 
tle will keep hunger from them," said Molly confidently. 

" Well, I hope so, but unfortunately times are very 
hard, and these people are strangers, while all Green- 
field charity is needed for the well-known poor." 

" Well, I believe in each one doing the duty that lies 
before him without waiting to see if others do theirs. 
We are strangers here, too ; so perhaps we have the best 
right to help those like ourselves." 

" But, my dear Molly," expostulated Harry, *' we can 
but just meet our own expenses." 

" I know, but if there is any real need we must do our 
part ; not as I should like to do it, for to a needy family 
I would like to give beefsteak and comforts as well as 



80 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

necessities, but that we can't do. What we can we will. 
Can we spare a dollar a month, do you think, from our 
twenty dollars margin ? " 

" Why, of course, if you say so." 

" I do, if necessary. I will see the woman and judge 
if the need is very pressing, and then, perhaps, some of 
our neighbors will do something." 

" You 're a brick, Molly, my dear, but what you may 
be thinking of I don't know." 

" If the necessity is great I can do something ; if it is 
not, the woman may despise what I can do." 

No more was said, but next morning, on her way back 
from the depot, after seeing Harry off, she went to a 
row of tiny tenements, built on tlie street through which 
the railroad passed, evidently the homes of the very 
poor, and in one of which she was told Mrs. Gibbs was 
to be found. 

In the very poorest of the very poor little group, she 
found the widow and her fatherless children, the oldest 
only five, the youngest not six weeks old. The mother 
looked so frail and white that Molly's heart ached to 
think that what she could do was hardly the sort of help 
this poor soul needed. Surely beef tea, and milk and 
eggs, and every nourishing thing was required to build 
up that fragile frame. And all she would be sure of 
giving was bread and occasionally, perhaps, a savory 
meal. How she wished she knew more people whom 
she might influence for the right kind of help ! 

She talked to Mrs. Gibbs, and learned that her poor 
husband had been in work only a fortnight, after being 
months idle from sickness, when the accident happened, 
and that the' baby was only three days old when its 
father died. 

"At first every one was good ; they came and helped 
me and did a great deal ; but there are so many needing 
help. I could not expect it all to be given to me, and I 
did think I might get a little sewing when I was out of 
bed, but I have no machine, and so I can only earn a 
few cents a week. What I should have done I don't 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 81 

know, if a kind gentleman had n't made a collection in 
his car for me, and brought me on Saturday $12, which 
is owing for two months' rent." 

" And you will have it all to pay away ? " cried Molly. 

" Yes, ma'am, I must, but oh, I 'm so thankful to have 
it. The dread of losing the roof over us is worse than 
hunger or anything." 

" But surely you have not needed food ? " 

The tears came to the woman's eyes. 

" I 'm never hungry, hut the children are, and yet I 
think if I could get good food for a week or two, I 
should get strong and could do work." 

'' That food she must have," thought Molly. " At all 
events, for a few days she shall have half a pound of 
steak or a chop. I believe her. That delicate look is 
semi-starvation." 

Molly bought at the butcher's that morning one pound 
of the tender side of the round steak. It cost sixteen 
cents, and she intended Mrs. Gibbs to have one third for 
three days. 

" Then when she has one nourishing solid meal a day 
she can make up on other things, and the dollar we have 
squeezed out for her must be made to go as far as pos- 
sible." 

When Molly had made her clear soup on Saturday 
she had looked regretfully at the couple of pounds of 
meat and vegetables that were strained from it, wishing 
she knew to whom to give it, as her own family was 
not large enough to need it, and hoping some one might 
ask for food at the door. She had kept it, also about a 
cup of the soup that was thick at the bottom (the rich- 
est part, although for appearance' sake it must not be 
used with dear soup). 

She had a use for it now : it would make a savory 
hash, not nourishing enough for an invalid like Mrs. 
Gibbs to depend on, but good for her children and her- 
self, in addition to the steak. 

Marta was busy washing ; so, soon after eleven, Molly 
chopped the meat and vegetables quite fine, added about 



82 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

a third the quantity of cold mashed potato to it, a tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and a table-spoonful of 
flour. This she moistened with a half cup of the soup 
and seasoned it with pepper and salt. Then she greased 
a deep yellow pie-plate, put the hash in it and set it in 
the oven. 

Having some kind of hot bread every morning, Molly 
used but very little bread. She had made a loaf on 
Saturday which was more than half left. She must 
give that, and make a few quick rolls for their own din- 
ner. 

While the hash was getting brown she put a pint of 
flour to dry and warm, and the third of a cake of com- 
pressed yeast to dissolve in a cup of warm milk, into 
which, when well mixed, she stirred a table-spoonful of 
butter till it got soft, and then the beaten yolk of an 
Q^g^ two tea-spoonfuls of sugar and one half of salt. 

She made a hole in the flour, poured in the milk, etc., 
and stirred them too-ether, addino; a little more warm 
milk till it was a thick paste, too stiff for batter, yet not 
stiff enough for dough, — just as stiff as it ivould be 
stirred with a spoon. She beat it for five minutes, and 
then set it, covered with a cloth, in a warm place. 

The hash was now quite brown ; and, as Molly had no 
one to send to-day, she put on her bonnet and took it 
and the bread and piece of steak to Mrs. Gibbs, begging 
her to cook and eat the latter for herself. 

" I will for baby's sake. Thank you ! Oh, thank 
you ! " 

At two o'clock the rolls Molly had set had risen to 
the top of the bowl, which had been half full. She beat 
them down with a spoon thoroughly, covered them again 
and put them to rise, and in an hour they were again 
light. The dough was beaten down, a dozen gem-pans 
were greased, and a scant table-spoonful of the paste put 
into each ; the paste was so thick and ropy that it was 
difficult to take up with a spoon, and a floured knife 
helped the performance. There was a small cupful 
left, and to this Molly put a tea-spoonful more sugar, and 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 83 

put it into a small round tin pan, that had once evi- 
dently been a dipper; this was for breakfast. They 
were all now put to rise, and in half an hour they looked 
like little balloons rising out of the pans. They were 
brushed lightly over with warm milk and put in the 
oven ; the rolls took fifteen minutes, the breakfast-cake 
twenty-five, to bake. 

The chicken pie Molly had made for Sunday had only 
been half eaten, as there had been three quarters of a 
pound of veal in it as well as the chicken, — the drum- 
sticks of which, by the way, she had reserved for Mon- 
day morning's breakfast, prepared in the following way : 

The sinews were taken out, when the feet were cut 
off, in this way : the yellow skin only was cut, the sin- 
ews were drawn out, the bones removed and their places 
filled with a forcemeat made of veal chopped very fine, 
with an equal proportion of salt pork. Molly had bought 
enough veal on Saturday for dinner and the pie, and she 
took a very small piece of that cooked in the latter, for 
her forcemeat, of which there was needed only two scant 
table-spoonfuls altogether, and just enough of the jelly 
to moisten it. She seasoned the forcemeat rather highly, 
then filled the place of the removed bones with it, taking 
care not to pack it too tight, sewed up the opening (hav- 
ing left a good piece of the skin of the thigh on the 
legs when removing them), wrapped each in a very thin 
slice of pork, tied them round, floured them, and baked 
them in a sharp oven twenty-five minutes, and they were 
brown and crisp when taken up. 

To make the pie presentable for dinner at small ex- 
pense she had ordered a dozen large oysters ; the oyster 
liquor was strained, a table-spoonful of butter and half 
one of flour put in a saucepan, stirred till they bubbled, 
then the cold pie, all but the pastry, added to it, with 
part of the oyster liquor and the oysters. The pastry 
was cut into neat pieces, and put into the oven to get hot, 
while Molly chopped a table-spoonful of parsley very fine. 
When the fricassee came to the boiling-point, it was 
carefully stirred round and the parsley sprinkled in, and 



84 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

then the oysters were left five minutes to plump. While 
doing this she directed Marta to prepare a fondue^ tell- 
ing her to put a table-spoonful of butter and one of flour 
in a small saucepan, stir them till they bubbled, and then 
to add a gill of milk to them. 

" That is really thick white sauce, you see, Marta ; you 
will soon know of how many things a good white sauce 
is the foundation. Stir to prevent burning. Now add 
to it the two ounces of cheese I told you to grate, and a 
level salt-spoonful of salt, and as much pepper as will go 
on the end of the salt-spoon. Now you can take it off 
the fire, and turn it into a bowl ; beat the yolks of two 
eggs light, and stir them to it. While you dish and 
dress the cabbage, and take up the potatoes and fricassee, 
I will beat the whites of three eorors solid." 

Molly wanted to see if Marta remembered how the 
cabbage was dressed the last time, and left her to it. 

When the vegetables were ready the fricassee was 
taken up, the chicken and veal laid in the centre of the 
dish, the oysters round it, and the strips of pastry at the 
four corners. 

Now the whites of eggs were stirred into the fondue 
gently ; it was poured into a small buttered dish, which 
it only half filled, and was put to bake while the first 
part of the dinner was eaten. 

" This will be done as soon as it is golden brown, and 
you must bring it to table at once, as it will fall if left 
standing." 

Molly meant to have dinners that were as little trou- 
ble as possible on Monday, feeling that as it was wash- 
ing day Marta should have less to do ; therefore the bill 
of fare was only 

Chicken and Oyster Fricassee. 

Cabbage. Potatoes. 

Fondue* Peaches and Cream. 

She h-ad also bought again a forequarter of lamb, so 
that she might see how far Marta had profited by her 
instructions. She would vary the cooking somewhat, 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 85 

but the cutting and arrangement of the joint would be 
the same. She noted in her account-book that evening : 

Lamb, $1.10 

Creaip, 10 

Oysters, .15 

Butter, 3 lbs., 75 

Fiffffs, 2 dozen, .50 

Peaches, 4 quarts, 20 

Total, $2.80 

She had learnt that the last week she had ordered too 
little butter and needed three pounds instead of two. 



CHAPTER XII. 

MOLLY AND MRS. LENNOX ON THE RUFFLE QUESTION 
FRICASSEE OF MUTTON CABBAGE AGAIN. 

Marta, unpromising as her appearance was, had 
shown considerable aptitude for cooking, but about the 
house generally she was rather hopeless. She had suc- 
ceeded already in breaking two of the pretty ornaments 
Molly had on her bureau, and therefore the latter had de- 
cided to trust her to touch nothing that required careful 
handling. She was hopelessly mixed, too, about laying 
the table. The breakfast was laid as for dinner, and vice 
versa, and the result was that Molly did not depend on 
her to do either, it being easier to do them herself. 
When she had kept house a few years longer she learnt 
that to do things herself was, in spite of the proverb, the 
way 7iot to get them done well by any one else. But 
the trouble was so slight she did not think it worth 
while to strus^gle against it. 

CO o 

She meant to have exactly the same dinner as last 
Tuesday, only she had shoulder of lamb roasted instead 
of^breast. She stood by while Marta cut the shoulder 
out, and then read over the recipe for tomato soup, and 
lemon pie, pastry for which was left from the chicken 
pie made on Saturday, and then left her to cook the din- 
ner alone, while she went to Mrs. Lennox according to 
her promise. 

She found that lady busy ironing. She looked white 
and exhausted, and yet there was a large pile of little 
clothes all trimmed by the mother's industrious fingers, 
and, alas, trimmed so much. 

Yet who could not understand a mother's desire to 
see her children dressed prettily, when it cost only a 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 87 

few hours more time, a little more fatigue to make them 
so? and how few are able to blend beauty and strict 
simplicity, although when it is blended the result is more 
charming than any dictate of fashion ? 

" Let me help you iron for an hour. We need not 
begin cooking just yet, if you saved the mutton broth, 
as there is no gravy to make." 

" Yes, I saved it, but you must n't think of ironing, 
— please don't." 

" I 'd like it. I am not expert, but every little helps, 
and your instruction will do me good. Let me go ou 
with that ruffle, while you get something I can't do. 
My Marta is ironing to-day, but by the look of things 
I 'm afraid I shall have to learn, myself, in order to teach 
her, if she proves teachable." 

" Ironing I have learned to do pretty well from ne- 
cessity. I only wish I had been brought up to do 
everything, it would all have come so much easier to 
me." 

" But it seems to me you can do so many things well," 
said Molly. " You sew so beautifully, and this ironing 
would shame most people who have been brought up to 
do it." 

" Yes, I can do anything I make up my mind to do ; 
so can most people, I think." 

"Yes, and that is why if an educated woman is forced 
into unaccustomed fields of work she does it better than 
those who are professedly working-women, — better in 
every case where sinew is not the chief desideratum." 

" Only," rejoined Mrs. Lennox, " she works with 
brains and hands too, and that is why the work tires her 
so much more than those who work mechanically." 

" I suppose so. I am a strong young woman and 
have never known a day's sickness, yet I am tired to 
death after a couple of hours in the kitchen, while 
Marta, who has been doing the hard work and has 
been on her feet hours longer, is fresh, and has to go 
on working while I can rest. Yet that thought makes 
me very tolerant of a servant's shortcomings, seeing my 
own limitations."

Molly was busy ironing the rujffle of a child's petticoat 
as she spoke, and Mrs. Lennox said, partly in explana- 
tion perhaps : " I dare say you think I 'm foolish to trim 
my children's clothes and make myself so much work ; 
but if you use cheap materials they look really quite 
mean without it. Mr. Lennox constantly quotes the 
beauty of simplicity, and points to the pictures of English 
children, as if I could n't see the beauty as well as he. 
But simplicity is costly or dowdy. A shilling calico or 
crossbar made ' Kate Greenaway ' fashion would look a 
poverty-stricken effort, while in linen or fine nainsook 
or India muslin they are charming. Flimsy materials 
won't hang well unless they are trimmed ; at the same 
time 1 do think I am wearing myself out for the sake of 
appearance, and often resolve that I will never make 
or iron another rufl3e." 

Molly had no experience as a mother of a family to 
offer poor strenuous Mrs. Lennox, whom she found a 
much brighter and more sensible woman than she had 
at first supposed. Yet she felt that the ruflfle question 
was a very serious one. 

" I hardly dare say anything about the matter, because 
I have so little experience, but I do feel that you are 
not strong enough to do such ironing as this ; and yet, as 
you say, poor material plainly made looks mean. How 
would it be to give up wash goods for e very-day use 
and wear dark blue flannel for a while ? Even wealthy 
people do that at the seaside, and one fiannel frock 
will cost no more than the four calico ones that take its 
place." 

" I have thought of it, and I do believe I will make 
an effort another summer ; but when you 've so many 
children the frocks come down from one to another, anc 
the only one I have ever to get new for is the eldest 
but next year I '11 get her a flannel frock and see how 
it works ; but though light flannel is really cool, she will 
fancy she 's hot if she sees her sisters in cotton." 

" Now, if you '11 tell me where your cold meat is, I 
will show you how the cold mutton may be made a very 
nice dish."

The meat and broth were soon before her, and by her 
direction Mrs. Lennox peeled and sliced two large onions 
and put them on to boil. 

" What vegetables did you intend having ? " 

" I 've been so busy ironing that I did not think of 
anything but potatoes, though Mr. Lennox does like a 
second one." 

" I see you have cabbage in the garden, and corn." 

"Yes, but the corn is too old, and the cabbage there 
is no time for ; besides, we have it so seldom, because I 
have to cook it in the morning so that the terrible smell 
may be out of the house before Mr. Lennox comes home, 
he is so fastidious ; though, I must say, the smell of cab- 
bage is something any one not fastidious might object 
to." 

" How long do you boil it ? " 

" Oh, two hours, sometimes more." 

" Do you mind my boiling it to-night ? " 

Mrs. Lennox stared. She had some confidence in 
Molly, yet cabbage for dinner — and it was now after 
five — was something absurd. 

" But it won't be done." 

" Oh yes, I see the kettle is full and boils. I am 
quite sure you won't believe me unless I show you ; but 
I do assure you there is no unpleasant odor about, cab- 
bage boiled as the English boil it, and in Europe it is 
considered the most wholesome of vegetables." 

Mrs. Lennox listened politely. 

" I will get a cabbage, of course." She left the 
kitchen for the purpose, and Molly smiled. She knew 
Mrs. Lennox was thinking what others less polite had 
said to her, "but we like our cabbage very well done," 
as if Molly must prefer it half raw. 

Molly had cut from the bones of roast and boiled mut- 
ton quite a large dish of meat, and the onions being ten- 
der she poured off the water from them, put to them a 
table-spoonful of butter and one of flour, with salt and 
pepper. As she was stirring them about, Mrs. Lennox 
brought in the cabbage, and cutting away leaves and part

of core as Molly directed, laid it in water, and half filled a 
good-sized pot with boiling water and set it on the range. 

"For your- six-o'clock dinner it must be well drained 
and go into that water at half past five." 

" I obey unquestioningly, but I confess to strong 
doubts as to whether we mean the same thing by boiled 
cabbao^e " — lausfhino^. 

" I know we don't," said Molly maliciously. " Will 
you look at this ? I am going to pour in a half pint of 
the broth, which I find you did flavor with vegetables." 

" Yes, I 'm not so ungrateful as to neglect your in- 
structions, after the success of our Saturday night's din- 
Der." (It should be mentioned that on Sunday Mrs. 
Lennox had come to tell Molly how good it was, and 
how much enjoyed.) " There was some left, very little, 
and a little kidney from yesterday's breakfast ; the chil- 
dren did not take any of that. This morning I warmed 
both together with a very little of that broth, and they 
made another good breakfast, and I felt that I had 
achieved something." 

" That was a splendid idea ; so few people think what 
two or three odds and ends put together will do, though 
each may be so little as to be almost worthless alone. 
Real economical management lies in this dovetailing one 
thing with another. This is what English and Ameri- 
cans know so little, and the Fi-ench so well." 

" I see that sauce is now like onion sauce, but less 
white." 

" It is onion sauce, made with broth instead of milk. 
Now we will lay the meat in and leave it to steep in this 
sauce at the back of the range, where it will keep at 
boiling-point but not boil. The last thing, add a tea- 
spoonful of vinegar or a few capers." 

Now the cabbage. 

" Yes, I 'm waiting for that miracle," said Mrs. Len- 
nox, coming with it in the colander, after shaking the 
water well out. " I shall lay the blame on your shoul- 
ders if Mr. Lennox's olfactories are offended ; he will 
forgive you anything, since through you we have lived

better and spent a dollar less in three days. There is 
nothing truer than that the way to a man's heart is 
througli his stomach." 

" Tlien we must take that path," said Molly merrily. 
"The cabbage needs a table-spooiiful of salt added to 
the water and a scant half tea-spoonful of soda." 

" I shall wait and see the success of the cabbage," 
added Molly, laughing, when she had seen it boiling fu- 
riously, " although the meat is done, so I may iron an- 
other piece or two." 

Both took up their irons, and after a few minutes Mrs. 
Lennox exclaimed : — 

" It is positively true ! " 

" What is ? " 

" That cabbage has no disagreeable smell." 

" No, but it would have if you left it on the stove ^o 
cook slowly for an hour or two. It is the long slow 
cooking in little water that ruins it and all green vege- 
tables." 

Mrs. Lennox now prepared to lay the cloth, and when 
she returned to the kitchen Molly had taken up the cab- 
bage and pressed it. It was bright pale green, streaked, 
where the heart was, with creamy white. 

" Is that the cabbage ? and is it done ? " 

" Try for yourself. You see it is far more tender than 
when slowly boiled, and is marrowy as spinach." 

" So it is ; but how did you find it out ? " 

*' I did n't. I was told by an English lady. I had 
noticed that all English cooking-books gave twenty min- 
utes to half an hour to boil cabbage, while ours always say 
two hours. And I noticed, too, it was never alluded to 
as a coarse, rank vegetable, and I asked an explanation 
from her, and she also told me she dared not eat cab- 
bage here, for fear of indigestion ; but I never yet found 
any one who believed me when 1 told them cabbage 
should only be boiled twenty-five minutes, nor can I 
induce them to try it. They all think that I prefer 
half-raw cabbage. Now I leave you to dress it as you 
like, for I must run home." 



92 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" I shall just put pepper, salt, and butter on it, it looks 
so pretty, — and to think there is only a pleasant odor ! " 

When Molly reached home she found Marta looking 
very scared. 

" What is wrong ? " asked Molly, sure that sonie 
disaster had occurred. 

Marta silently pointed to the soup, which looked like 
pink curds and whey ; then, turning rather sulkily to the 
Slewed tomatoes, she evidently expected to be scolded. 

Molly said nothing for the moment, but opened the 
oven and found the shoulder of lamb beautifully brown, 
and other things doing well ; she was heartily glad there 
was something to praise. 

" You 've made a mistake with the soup, Marta ; but 
everything else lof-ks very nice. That meat is done as 
well as I could do it. Now, in the first place, you were 
in too great a hurry. The milk and tomato were only 
to go together the last thing, but that has n't caused the 
milk to curdle. You cannot have read your recijDC 
over as you made it, and have forgotten the soda ? " 

"No, I put the soda in." 

Molly felt she could not be speaking the truth, but 
when she tasted the soup, found she was. 

" Well, I don't understand this. Tell me exactly 
how you did it." 

Marta rehearsed her movements and then it turned 
out she had put the soda in last, after the tomato, and of 
course it had curdled before that. She explained this, 
told her to strain the soup, and then went to prepare the 
table quickly, for Harry would be home in a minute. 

On the whole, although the soup was a failure, Molly 
was satisfied with Marta's first unaided efforts. The 
lemon pie, in spite of her own admonition to handle the 
paste very little, she had pressed with her thumb round 
the edge, to make it smooth, no doubt. The consequence 
was, the paste was nice and short, but bore no resem- 
blance to puff paste, either in appearance or in eating, 
but Molly had not expected anything better, and re- 
served comments until the next time, when she would 
again show her how to use pastry. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

PREPARING TO SAVE WORK — BROWN THICKENING 
WHITE THICKENING — CARAMEL. 

Molly had resolved to take the first opportunity to 
prepare two or three articles for her storeroom which 
would simplify work for Marta, and indeed she herself 
had felt the lack already of these very articles. 

Brown thickening saves a great deal of standing over 
the fire and stirring of butter and flour together, when 
it is ready, and if thickening of soup or stew is intrusted 
to inexperienced hands, it often results in something 
very different from what it should be, while with ready- 
prepared thickening {roux, the French call it) a blunder 
is less possible. The ironing being out of the way then 
on Wednesday, she resolved to make that and several 
other things, or rather to superintend while Marta car- 
ried out her orders. 

" Marta, put half a pound of butter in a small 
saucepan or bowl to melt, and while it is doing so, 
weigh and sift half a pound of flour. Skim the butter ; 
now pour it off carefully from the milk that has settled 
at the bottom into another small thick saucepan, and 
stir it into the flour. Keep on stirring till it is bright 
brown. Watch carefully that it does n't burn ; that is 
almost dark enough. In saying ' bright brown ' I mean a 
rich, pale golden brown, not dark like coffee. Now put 
it into this little marmalade jar, and when it is cold lay a 
piece of paper on the top and put it away for use. It 
will keep for months, and when I tell you to thicken any 
brown gravy, use this for the purpose instead of fresh 
butter and flour. The flavor is richer than any hastily 
made thickening. 



94 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

"Now we will make some white thickening. Wash 
out the saucepan, melt the butter, half a pound, just in 
the same way. Now stir in it half a pound of flour ; 
keep on stirring as long as you can, before it begins to 
change color. It must not be at all brown, yet the flour 
must be well cooked. Therefore stir it in a cooler 
spot than the other. When the flour no longer smells 
raw, put it into a small bowl. Cover as you did the 
other and put it away. This is for white thickening, 
for fricassee or to dress vegetables, etc. 

"Now wash the saucepan again, and we will make 
some caramel for coloring. Pnt in it a cup of sugar and 
a quarter cup of water. Let them boil till the syrup be- 
gins to change color, then watch it carefully. Tilt the 
saucepan from all sides so that it may get equally brown. 
The moment it is all nearly black, but before it chars in 
the least, put to it a cup of boiling water ; take care of 
yourself, for it sputters a good deal. Now let it boil till 
it is all dissolved and like very dark syrup. A tea-spoon- 
ful of this, or less, will give a flne color to gravy or soup 
if not dark enough in itself. It will also color icing for 
cake or custard, and in fact is always very useful." 



CHAPTER XIV. 

MARKETING APPLE PUDDING — LIVER AND BACON — 

BRAISED BEEF BOILING PUDDINGS. 

When Molly reached her butcher's next morning, 
Wednesday, she was surprised to find Mrs. Lennox 
there, and by the way she hastened to the door to greet 
her it was evident she was waiting for her. 

" I knew you would come here, and I am going to 
enlist under your banner, so you must tell me what to 
buy and how to cook it." 

" Oh dear me ! " cried Molly in consternation. 

" Do you mind ? I beg your pardon, I ought " — 

" Oh, it is not that, but it 's such a responsibility. 
Suppose I advise something you' don't like? " 

" If you did it would n't be very dreadful, but I don't 
believe you will. I only know we 've enjoyed every 
meal since Saturday, and I 'm nearly a dollar in pocket." 

" If that is really so I shall have something to sug- 
gest in colder weather. You see I know nothing of your 
tastes." 

" I believe we like a good many things we don't have, 
but anything outside of steak and chops will be a wel- 
come change." 

" What do you say to liver and bacon, and, as it is so 
inexpensive, have a nice apple pie or pudding with it. 
Do you like liver ? " 

" Yes, but Mr. Lennox protests I do not cook it 
right." 

'' Suppose we take one — a lamb's liver " — 

" Lamb's ? I always get calf's." 

" I think you will find this quite as nice and less ex- 
pensive, — and I believe I will take one myself. Harry

used to anathematize the liver at breakfast in the board- 
ing-house so vigorously, for being cooked in thick slices 
like steak and whitey-brown in color, that I think he 
will enjoy it now." 

" I am afraid that is the way mine generally is. Now 
what shall I get for to-morrow ? " 

" If you had not had mutton so lately, I would sug- 
gest Irish stew ; but what do you say to a pot-roast of 
beef, — or, to be finer, we will call it ' braised beef ' ? " 

" My dear, we have nothing but mutton and beef, so 
an Irish stew will be very good ; and I certainly want 
to know how to make it well." 

" Still, I advise the small pot-roast to-morrow and an 
Irish stew later." 

"Very well, either will be good. Now what meat 
shall I get for it ? " 

"Three pounds of thick flank — of beef." 

The butcher handed out a thin piece nearly all fat. 

" No, no, that is not the part ; have you not the flank 
with a broad piece of lean running through it ? " asked 
Molly. 

The butcher now produced a piece of meat about four 
inches tliick, three of which were lean. 

" That is it." 

It was ten cents a pound. By Molly's direction Mrs. 
Lennox got also half a pound of fat bacon, and her ex- 
penditure was : — 

Lamb's liver 10 

Bacon .07 

Beef 30 

.47 

" Now we have meat for two days, for about what 
I have always paid for one." 

" And you '11 have something for breakfast, you '11 
find." 

" The great thing will be the variation of our old 
routine, and the money-saving ; but can't you jusi tell me 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 97 

how they should be cooked, instead of coming your- 
self?" 

" Yes, I will write out the recipes and send Marta 
with them." 

" And the apple pudding." 

" Ah, yes, you have suet in the house ? Well, make a 
crust exactly as you did for the pot-pie ; roll it out half 
an inch thick. Grease a bowl well and lay the paste in 
it, letting what is to spare hang over the sides ; fill it with 
pared and cored apples cut small, and put over them two 
table-spoonfuls of sugar and a little water. Wet the 
border of the paste and gather up the overhanging sides, 
pinching them all together, so that there is no chance 
for juice to escape. Then dip the centre of a cloth in 
boiling water, flour it and put it over the pudding, tie it 
firmly with string just under the flare of the bowl, so 
that it will not slip up ; bring the four corners of the 
cloth up over the top of the pudding and tie them. 

" Before you begin to make the pudding, set a pot, 
that is large enough to boil it in, on the stove, half full 
of water ; when it is fast boiling, put the pudding in and 
let it boil up quickly again, and boil for an hour and a 
half without stopping." 

" But I suppose the water must not cover over the 
top of it." 

" Oh, indeed, yes ; so long as the water bolls there is 
no danger of its getting into the pudding. As soon as it 
stops it begins to soak ; that is why so many boiled pud- 
dings are heavy and soggy." 

" Well, I never knew that. I knew they were often 
heavy, but not why. I rather supposed it was because 
they were boiled iu too much water, and so it got into 
them." 

They had talked along the quiet village streets, until 
Molly's door was reached, and half an hour afterwards 
Marta ran across the road with the two following rec- 
ipes : — 

PoT-RoAST OR Braised Beef. — Remove the skin 
and some of the fat from the flank of beef (put both in 



98 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

the oven with half a pint of water to " try out "), sprinkle 
the beef with two level tea-spoonfuls of salt and half a 
salt-spoonful of pepper, a table-spoonful of finely-chopped 
parsley, if you have it, and a scant tea-spoonful of tliyme, 
also, if you have it. Roll up the beef tightly with these 
flavorings inside, flour the meat and put in a thick sauce- 
pan or pot with a wine-glass of vinegar and two cloves. 
Cover very closely, and if the lid of the saucepan does 
not fit well put a clean cloth over it. Let it so remain 
till nearly browned, turning it about occasionally. Have 
ready a cari-ot and half an onion sliced, and when the 
meat has been slowly cooking nearly two hours, put 
them to it with half a pint of boiling water and a dessert- 
spoonful of Worcestershire or any nice table sauce, if 
you have it, and simmer very slowly two hours longer ; 
then take up the meat, remove the strings, carefully 
skim all fat from the gravy which pour over it. 

In summer put a pint of young peas into the gravy ; 
fried potatoes are very good with this dish. 

N. B. You will observe I have said with regard to 
some of the flavorings ^^ if you have it.'' I mean by that 
they are not necessary, but a great improvement; and, 
as they cost very little, if you want plain dishes made 
savory it is economical to have them always in the 
house. 

Liver and Bacon. — Wash the liver, dry it, cut it 
with a sharp knife into slices the third of an inch thick. 
Dip each slice in flour. Cut some bacon in thin slices, 
remove the rind and fry it crisp but don't burn it ; then 
lay in the liver, only enough to cover the bottom of the 
pan ; when nicely brown turn each slice ; brown the 
other side and take it up on a hot dish with the bacon 
around it. Kow if the fat is not burned (and to prevent 
that, it should be fried where the fire is good but not too 
fierce) stir into it a scant dessert-spoonful of flour, mash- 
ing all the brown bits and lumps with the back o£ a 
spoon ; when it is all afne hrown, have a cup of boiling 
water ready, and pour it quickly into the pan. Stir till 
smooth. Let it boil down till thick as good cream, sea- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 99 

son with pepper and salt and a tea-spoonful of vinegar 
or Worcestershire sauce, and pour it over the liver. 

If by chance the fat was burned pour it out of the 
pan, for it would make a hitter, black gravy, and spoil 
the whole. Put into the pan a dessert-spoonful of but- 
ter and one of flour, let them get quite brown stirring 
the while, when proceed with water as before. 

If you have ready-browned flour in the house it saves 
standino; over the fire waitinsj for it to brown in the flit 
or butter, and as you may like to prepare some I send 
directions. Of course whitey-brown gravy is very disa- 
greeable. 

Brown Flour, for thickening gravy quickly. Sift 
half a pound of flour into a dripping-pan and set it in a 
hot oven. Look at it occasionally and stir it well, tak- 
ing care it does not burn ; when it is the color of coffee 
that is half milk, or pale cafe au lait color, take it out 
and put it in a tin for use. You will require a third 
more of this to thicken than of raw flour. 



CHAPTER XV. 

ROLLS BAKED LIVER CROQUETTES WHAT WAS 

THE MATTER WITH THEM HOTCH-POTCH. 

Marta had twice made bread very satisfactorily, and 
Molly thought she might now show her how to make 
plain rolls ; therefore she had told her to save out a 
piece of her bread dough, about a pint bowl full, and 
when she returned from taking the recipes to Mrs. 
Lennox, Molly was ready to show her how to make 
them. 

It was ten o'clock, and Molly reckoned they would be 
warm for dinner if made now. 

" These are going to be quite plain rolls ; when you 
succeed in these we will try finer ones. Get a good 
table-spoonful of butter, — lard would do, but I use it as 
little as possible for health's sake — put it near the fire 
to warm a very little ; add to the dough two tea-spoonfuls 
of sugar ; now the butter is pliable, work it in ; it will 
take five minutes' constant kneading to make the butter 
and dough quite smooth. Now you see it is softer than 
bread dough ; if a crisp crust is wanted, work in gradu- 
ally a little more flour, almost a table-spoonful, — if the 
weather is cold have it warm ; if a soft crust is pre- 
ferred leave it as it is. Put the dough to rise in a warm 
place behind the stove, but not too hot, or it may sour ; 
in from two to three hours it will have risen again very 
light ; work it over thoroughly for three or four min- 
utes till it is again as small as now, and set it to rise 
again, and when light come and tell me. 

"This evening we shall have bisque of oysters, baked 
liver, and croquettes, and you can make a peach pud- 
ding by your recipe, but I want you to use cold lamb 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 101 

for croquettes ; I will prepare it before I go out of the 
kitchen so that it will be ready whenever you are, and 
remember if you forget anything to come to me." 

Molly cut the meat from the cold shoulder of lamb, 
removed every bit of skin and gristle, and then chopped 
it very fine ; she had not left that to Marta because 
she might not be careful enough. She also flavored the 
meat by using a bit of onion as large as a dime chopped 
till as fine as sand, and a tea-spoonful of parsley, also 
chopped fine, and a pinch of thyme ; these were mixed 
with the lamb, and Marta was told to do the rest as if 
making croquettes of chicken. 

Molly intended asking her friend, Mrs. Welles, to 
come and stay a week with her soon, and as that would 
entail a little extra expense, she meant to economize 
somewhat for a week or two ; therefore she omitted 
some little items from her bill of fare, and substituted 
others that would be cheaper. This interfered very 
slightly with her plan of letting Marta do alone nearly 
all that she herself had done the last week. 

The girl would be able to make croquettes with one 
meat as easily as another, and although for the sake of 
practice she meant to repeat the dishes, she did not care 
to have them in the same order. The bisque of oysters 
she would have in place of clams for the sake of variety 
and of showing Marta that the principle was the same in 
both, and that another time she might substitute lobster 
instead of either, and yet the process would not change. 
Another thing she had in mind was that as the breast of 
lamb she had for Thursday would be a rather slim din- 
ner, the oyster patties, of which Harry was extrava- 
gantly fond, would make up. 

Soon after one o'clock Marta came to say that the 
rolls had risen, been worked down, and were now light 
enough, she thought, to push down. 

When she went into the kitchen she found the dough 
just about as light as bread should be. 

" No, Marta, this is not light enough. Rolls should 
rise a great deal lighter than bread. They will need to 



102 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

rise another half hour — but as I see the oysters are 
here, I will use some of them for patties for to-morrow's 
dinner." 

Molly took a third of the pint of oysters, and then 
half a gill of the liquid, and scalded both for a minute ; 
then, taking out the oysters, added an equal quantity of 
milk to the liquor, and in another small saucepan put 
two tea-spoonfuls of butter, the same of flour ; and, stir- 
ring them together till the}^ bubbled, she poured milk 
and oyster liquid to them, stirring till they were quite 
smooth. She seasoned this sauce and then dropped the 
oysters, each one cut in four, into it. She did not mean 
to use them to-day, but the oysters kept raw would not 
be good ; cooked in this way they would be as good as 
when fresh. 

The rolls being now light Molly stuck her fingers two 
or three times downward into the light mass, and it 
sank under them. 

" This is what you are to do, Marta, when I tell you 
to * push the rolls down ; ' do this twice or three times 
after they have been tivice thoroughly worked over — 
take notice, only lightly stick your fingers in, to let out 
air ; don't knead them at all, nor try to make them 
smooth ; leave them just so ; they come up again very 
rapidly after the first time, and this is the secret of hav- 
ing rolls of a close, exceedingly light texture, that will 
have no doughy inside." 

An hour later the rolls had risen and been pushed 
down three times, and Molly, after working them all 
over again, took a little piece of butter on her hand, 
broke off bits of the dough as big as an English walnut, 
and rolled them between her buttered palms, and then 
dropped each on to a greased tin two inches apart. 
They were set to rise till they would be like small bal- 
loons — each quite double the size it was when first 
made. They would perhaps take three quarters of an 
hour to rise, but Molly cautioned Marta that she could 
not go by time in bread-making, for that differed so 
constantly ; in summer it would be less, and in winter 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 103 

more ; the degree of heat in the kitchen would make 
the greatest difference ; also, some kinds of flour rose 
more quickly tlian others. 

It must not be supposed Molly had forgotten Mrs. 
Gibbs ; she had her and her family in mind when she or- 
dered the liver. The neck end of her lamb this week 
she was going to make into a nourishing Scotch broth, 
and out of the dollar, of which she had spent only fif- 
teen cents as yet, she bought ten pounds of rye flour 
and Ave of white. 

This would provide bread for a month, and as the 
poor woman was yet so weak, Molly meant to have it 
made at her own house for the present. 

When the rolls were light enough to bake, they were 
brushed over with white of egg. The chicken pie on 
Saturday, it will be remembered, had only taken part of 
the white left from the forcemeat balls ; the rest was 
beaten with a tea-spoonful of water and set in the ice- 
box for just such an occasion as this, and was now 
used to brush over the rolls. 

While the rolls baked, Molly prepared the liver for 
the dinner, and told Marta to make the Scotch hotch- 
potch for the Gibbs family. 

" Cut the meat up in pieces ; put it in a saucepan with 
two onions, half a small cup of Scotch barley, a carrot 
and a turnip, a quart and pint of water, and a tea-spoon- 
ful and a half of salt ; in an hour shred up a quarter of 
a cabbage and add it. Let it all simmer for two hours 
and a half, or until the barley is very soft." 

Molly, while Marta was doing this, washed and dried 
the liver, cut about a dozen strips of fat pork as thick 
as her little flnger, and with a narrow knife made many 
incisions through the liver and then inserted the pork. 
When all was done she floured it, sprinkled a little salt 
over it and it was ready for the oven. 

When the liver was cooked — it took just half an 
hour in a hot oven — it was taken up, put on a hot dish, 
and a half cup of boiling water poured into it ; round 
the pan was a great deal of thick glaze ; this was all

rubbed off and dissolved in the gravy ; a tea-spoonful of 
"Worcestershire sauce was added and a pinch of salt, and 
then the gravy was poured over the liver. 

The dish was a great success. Harry, without an 
idea that it had cost but ten cents, cut it in slices a 
quarter of an inch thick, which, where mottled with the 
pork and the rich brown gravy, gave quite an air to the 
homely viand. The bisque of oysters Marta had man- 
aged very nicely, and also the peach pudding, all but the 
foaming sauce, which Molly had shown her how to 
make ; it was a good sauce, but did not foam ; the only 
real fault was with the croquettes, which were like sau- 
sage meat and not at all creamy. Molly made no com- 
ments at the time, knowing that a much more experi- 
enced cook often made no better, but next morning she 
meant to find out where the mistake was. 

" Did you notice, Marta, that the croquettes last night 
were not quite right ? " 

" Yes, they were harder, but I went exactly by the 
directions." 

" I want you to tell me just what you did, and then 
we will see where the mistake came in. You managed 
everything else so nicely." 

Marta repeated the recipe correctly and Molly was 
puzzled. 

" Are you sure you did just as you say ? " 

" Yes, ma'am." 

" Then show me how you measured half a pint." 

" Ah, there it is ; you have really only a little more 
than a gill. Did you measure like that yesterday ? " 

Marta confessed that she had, and the puzzle was 
solved, and more understandable still when Molly saw 
what she called a table-spoonful of flour ; it was really 
near two, for she had used the large kitchen basting- 
spoon, and used it heaped. 

" Now, Marta, I want to tell you something. You 
are anxious to cook like the man cook you once knew ; 
that is, you want everything you do to turn out always 
right, and they will only do that by your being very ex* 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 105 

act about measuring and weighing. A tea -spoonful 
more or less seems a trifle, and yet it will spoil many 
things. Remember, if you have a recipe that calls for a 
table-spoonful, it means just that, if the recipe is good 
for anything, and half a pint is exactly that measure 
full^ not partly full. 

" Goulfe, the celebrated French cook, who wrote a re- 
markable book for other cooks, was so particular that 
he explains exactly how much he means by weight 
when he says ' a pinch of salt,' and he directs one to 
weigh each carrot and turnip for soup till one's eye is 
accustomed to the sizes." 



CHAPTER XVI. 

RYE BREAD OYSTER PATTIES KNUCKLE OF VEAL, 

A LA MAITRE d'h6tEL A SAVORY DISH. 

Molly knew the virtues of rye bread ; and in per- 
fection, as bad sbe eaten it once in ber life, sbe bad en- 
joyed it mucb, — it bad been so sweet, so ligbt, and 
seemed to bave tbe quality of never getting stale. She 
knew tbat to some people rye bread represented a loaf 
tbat cut like liver, tbat was sweet in flavor, but in 
wbeaten bread would bave been called beavy ; and to 
otbers it was a sour, dark bread, mucb approved by 
Germans. But tbat rye bread need be neitber of these 
sbe knew well, but she bad no recipe. Then sbe re- 
membered Mrs. Merit and ber experience ; perhaps she 
could help ber with rye bread, as she was a famous 
economist. 

Sbe therefore paid a visit to her neighbor, and after 
a respectable amount of small talk broached ber subject. 

" Rye bread ! laws yes — when my family was large 
we bad it, because it don't cost more than half as mucb 
as wheat Hour does, and it 's as easy to make as mush. 
You just make a thick batter of one third white flour, 
two thirds rye ; stir into each quart two tea-spoonfuls of 
baking-powder — and bake." 

This was a new recipe to Molly, and she meant to try 
it some day ; but for the Gibbs family, she was satisfied 
that a properly yeast-leavened bread would be more 
wholesome, and she therefore resolved to see what she 
could do. Sbe had quite a library of cook-books, but 
rye bread for general use did not seeni to be in them. 
On thinking it over she couldn't see tvby rye bi^ad 
should not be made in tbe same way a& white. Finally 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 107 

she went to work to make it exactly as white bread, 
making a sponge with a pint of white flour and half a 
cake of yeast, dissolved in a pint of warm water, a table- 
spoonful of sugar and two tea-spoonfuls of salt. When 
this was as full of holes as honeycomb, she put to it two 
pints of rye flour and used as much warm water as 
would make all into a soft dough. She kneaded it, but 
began to understand why it was usually stirred, for it 
stuck to her hands like bird-lime, and to use flour 
enough to free them would, she knew, spoil her bread. 
She worked on, regardless of stickiness, and when it 
was mixed divided the dough in three, put it in tins to 
rise, and when each was double the first size, they were 
baked in a very moderate oven one hour. 

When they were done Molly saw she had attained 
the secret of her friend's bread, for it was sweet, 
spongy, and with a tender crust. She kept one loaf for 
her own use and sent the rest to Mrs. Gibbs, with the re- 
mains of the liver made into savory collops, as follows : 
It was chopped fine, and an equal quantity of bread 
crumbs added, a quarter tea-spoonful of powdered marjo- 
ram, half one of thyme and pepper and salt ; to these, 
were put a few scraps of cold fried bacon and a little 
cold ham left from Wednesday morning's breakfast, both 
chopped fine. The mince was just moistened with 
broth (from boiling down lamb bones with an onion), 
and a table-spoonful of flour stirred with it. Molly then 
made it into three good-sized balls, put them into a 
small, deep pan, poured in the rest of the broth, and put 
them to bake in the hot oven for half an hour. 

It may be thought Molly was taking great trouble for 
Mrs. Gibbs. She knew that, and had she had it in her 
power to give money enough to be of substantial service 
to a destitute family, would not have done it. In this 
case, as with her husband's income, she looked on her 
time as moaey, since by it she could make a little money 
go far,. Adollar given to Mrs. Gibbs would have done 
little — bought bread for a week, perhaps, and a meal or 
two besides ; the liver sent round to her cold would have 



108 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

been eaten so, and been miserable and insufficient for a 
dinner ; the neck of lamb the same ; but by the time, not 
an hour after all. she had double the value of what she 
could give, and the bread she would make from the flour 
would last three times as long as baker's bread. In ad- 
dition to this she went to the house where she bought 
her cream and asked what they did with their skimmed 
milk, and was told they made it into pot-cheese when 
they had much, but half the time they gave it away ; 
she then obtained a promise that they would give Mrs. 
Gibbs two quarts a day if she sent for it. Being sure 
of milk, Molly felt that the best thing she could do now 
was to buy ten pounds of corn meal and send it to them 
for mush. This exhausted the dollar, and beyond mak- 
ing the bread and sending an occasional meal, to be con- 
cocted out of something that would not much enlarge 
her own expenses, she knew that she could do nothing, 
but did not despair of interesting others. 

Molly did not want to let her little lecture on cro- 
quettes grow cold in Marta's mind, and therefore meant 
to have them again very soon. To that end she made a 
tour of the butcher-shops in Greenfield, of which there 
were several, in order to find, if she could, a knuckle of 
veal. This would kill two or three birds with one stone. 
Veal is not plentiful in September, yet is sometimes in 
market, and for the knuckle she knew she would have 
to pay very little, for in this country it is looked upon 
as only good for stock, while in Europe it is very 
choice. She was fortunate enough to get one ; it was 
quite large, that is. the meat was not cut too far down, 
and because of this extra size she paid twenty cents for 
it instead of the usual fifteen cents. She also bought a 
piece of salt pork (very sweet, which she could tell by 
the pinkish fat) for twenty cents, and four lamb's kid- 
neys for breakfast for five cents. So surprised was the 
Greenfield butcher at her wanting them that at first he 
had seemed to think they were hardly worth a price ; 
evidently he did not know that they were quite a dainty 
in the fashionable markets of New York, and as Harry 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 109 

would not eat beef kidney, but was very fond of others, 
she made up her mind to have them often. 

The knuckle of veal was to be boiled the next day very 
gently, in jnst water enough to cover it, for two hours, 
with a small turnip, a bay leaf, and a carrot, an onion, 
and a bouqnet of sweet herbs. The pork was to be 
cooked in the same water, and served to eat with the 
veal, which would have a rich parsley sauce poured over 
it, fried potatoes and fried smelts. 

Molly thought it a good plan to have fried fish, instead 
of soups, or boiled fish, every day when the rest of the 
dinner was boiled. 

From the veal there would be the stock for soup, and, 
as there would be more meat than would be eaten, what 
was left would make croquettes. She did not mean to 
have them for dinner so soon again, but for breakfast. 
The practice for Marta was what she wanted. 

Molly had some " rough puff paste " which she in- 
tended to use for the oyster patties. She rolled it out 
half an inch thick, then with a biscuit-cutter cut several 
rounds ; these she put one on another three deep, and on 
each pressed a smaller biscuit-cutter half way through. 
She had cut twelve rounds of paste, which made four 
patties (three rounds or layers to the patty), and each 
had a circle (cut with a small cutter) on the top layer. 
These were put on a baking-tin and brushed over with 
a feather dipped in white of egg, and put in the oven, 
which was very hot, yet not likely to scorch. To try 
the heat Molly put in her hand and began to count sec- 
onds ; when she had counted twenty she was forced to 
take out her hand, and knew the oven was right. 

While she waited for them to bake, she proceeded to 
finish the oysters for Hlling, first telling JNIarta to beat 
up the remaining white of egg with a little water, and 
put it away for nse. 

The yolk was just what was needed for the oysters. 
She strained them from the sauce, which she put on to 
boil; then when quite boiling and smooth she dropped 
the oysters in (it will be remembered they had been not 



110 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

more thaD scalded yesterday), and in about two minutes 
they were firm, yet not shrunken. She took them from 
the fire and stirred in the yolk of an egg^ already 
whipped, with a tea-spoonful of the cold sauce. They 
were thick before, but immediately became thicker as 
the heat cooked the egg, and the sauce was now about 
the consistency of the cream filling used for cream cakes 
or eclairs. 

By this time the patties were baked. They were 
more than three inches high, and after they had been 
out of the oven a short time, Molly carefully removed 
the centre of the top layer marked out with the small 
cutter, and laid it aside, for it was the cover of the patty ; 
then with a small coffee-spoon she scooped out the half- 
cooked paste from the centre, and then replaced the top. 
They were now ready to be filled, but as they would 
have to be made hot for dinner she did not fill them, as 
the paste would be bui'nt uj) before the inside would be 
warm ; she therefore dii-tcted Marta to stand the oysters 
in boiling water a few minutes before serving them, and 
keep them stirred, and to put the patty-cases in the oven 
at the same time ; let them get thoroughly heated, and 
when both were hot, put the oyster filling in them with 
a spoon. Molly gave these directions for the moral 
effect, but, having strong suspicions that Marta would be 
unequal to such neat-handed work and might cover the 
outside of the patties with the filling, saw to that part 
herself before going to the table. 



CHAPTER XVIL 

MK. AND MRS. BISHOP BECOME MEMBERS OF A DRA* 

MATIC CLUB — CROQUETTES OVER AGAIN WHERE 

THE MISTAKE LAY WHITE SOUP. 

Harry and Molly had talked over the matter of the 
dramatic club, and whether they could afford to join it. 
Molly was old enough, not being a school-girl bride — did 
I ever mention that she was twenty-four ? — and had seen 
enough of the world to know that, although a woman's 
ideal of married life may be to sew in the evening, 
while her husband reads to her, or, if he is weary, to read 
to him while he rests, a man very often prefers something- 
more exhilarating. Although Harry had never seemed 
bored by a tete-a-tete evening, she remembered that he 
had never yet been subjected to the long uninterrupted 
quiet of country winter nights, and she wanted to run no 
risk of him finding their life humdrum. He was not a 
reader in the true sense of the word, — that is to say, 
he read for amusement's sake. If the book he read was 
not to his mind, he threw it aside, or fell asleep over it, 
and he was not so fond of reading aloud as Molly could 
have wished. However, this was one of the little dis- 
appointments most women, and some men, have to put 
up with, and she was thankful there was nothing worse. 
It is true that, finding Harry cared less for reading than 
herself, she had devoted herself to chess, of which he 
was very fond, and their evenings seldom passed without 
having the men out ; but Harry was too much in sympa- 
thy with his wife not to know that chess, to her, was a 
sort of loving pleasure, and had often pretended disincli- 
nation ; therefore the prospect of a weekly social meet- 
ing and the many little entertainments that would grow 
out of it was, for Harry's sake, a pleasant one. 



112 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" What are the actual expenses ? " she had asked. 
" I don't know, but from what Franiley said, I imag- 
ine these are merely nominal, outside the entertaining of 
the club, which falls to every one's share once in the 
season." 

"Yet as we are so limited in money matters, we can 
run no risks ; what would be nominal to people with 
double our income may be serious for us. I think I 
had better wait and see Mrs. Framley." 

That lady called before Molly had been quite two 
weeks in Greenfield ; she was very handsomely dressed, 
but of rather formal manners, which Molly came to know 
were natural to her, and rather a distress to herself. 
After the usual chat of a morning call Mrs. Framley 
said : — 

" I believe Mr. Framley spoke to Mr. Bishop about 
our reading-society. Mr. and Mrs. Winfield were mem- 
bers, and as we limit the club to fifteen couples we 
thought it would be very pleasant if you and Mr. Bishop 
would take their places." 

Molly colored a little, hesitated, then said : — 
" Will you please tell me the exact conditions and ex- 
penses ? " 

" Well, there are no particular conditions, except that 
no member is admitted that is not acceptable to all. 
Your names were proposed by Mr. Winfield and warmly 
welcomed ; the expenses are nominal." 

Molly smiled. She had braced herself to be quite 
frank. 

" But what is nominal ? I may as well tell you our 
income is little more than sufficient for our needs, and 
we cannot risk incurring expense that may be quite be- 
yond us." 

" But there are several of our members who are in the 
same position, and for that reason we made a few rules 
at the start so that our club should not break up, as so 
many have done, on the .rock of emulous hospitality. 
The actual expenses have never exceeded $2 each per- 
son for the winter, and have oftener been under a del- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 113 

lar and a half. This is outside the cost of entertaining. 
Every member having a house is supposed to have the 
meeting once in the season, and as all our members are 
householders, and some very hospitable, when anything 
occurs to make such reception inconvenient it is gladly 
taken by some one else ; but as some are much wealthier 
tlian others, a rule was made that no ice-cream, oysters 
or bought cakes were to be allowed, only sandwiches, 
tea, coffee and home-made cake, and I am glad to say 
one lady, one of the most wealthy, has nothing but 
home-made wafers and coffee." 

" Then T think Mr. Bishop and myself can accept the 
memi)ership with an easy conscience, although I hardly 
see what acquisition I can be, for I cannot act. I don't 
know whether my husband has any talent that way." 

" I think you may have hidden your light," said Mrs. 
Framley, politely, " but at least half of the members are 
honorary and only give us the pleasure of their pres- 
ence ; in fact, I myself am only an onlooker." 

" Then I will have courage. When is the next meet- 
ing?'; 

" Next Wednesday, at my house, and I am pleased to 
think your first evening will be there." 

Molly thanked her, and soon after Mrs. Framley rose 
to go. 

" I hope we shall see much of each other, Mrs. Bishop. 
Mrs. Winfield told me we should have a great deal in 
common, being both devoted to cooking-school." 

Molly responded suitably and Mrs. Framley left. 

Molly had made some mixture for croquettes early in 
the morning, going minutely over every detail with 
Marta, using cold veal with a slice of the boiled pork, 
chopped together very fine, in place of chicken. Some 
of the stock in which the veal was boiled, which was 
now a firm jelly, was used, and as there was no cream, 
Molly used half a gill of milk to the gill of stock, and 
an egg beaten ; the milk and stock were stirred to the 
butter and flour (see recipe for chicken croquettes) and 
boiled till thick and smooth, the meat and seasoning 



114 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

then added, and when it was all hot, the beaten ^gg. 
After this was in, the mixture was only stirred one min- 
ute, and then taken off the fire, the object being to bring 
the whole to boiling-point, but not to curdle the egg. 
The mixture was put out on a dish and set to get cold 
and firm, and Marta told to make it into croquettes ac- 
cording to her recipe. 

As Molly was very anxious that Marta should thor- 
oughly master the art of making croquettes, she had in- 
tended to oversee the forming and frying of these, which 
were for her lunch ; but Mrs. Framley's visit had inter- 
fered, and when she went to the kitchen she found 
Marta had one croquette on paper in the colander and 
was fishing in the hot fat with her skimmer. 

" What is the matter, Marta ? " asked Molly, although 
she could guess what had happened. 

Marta pointed to the top of the fat, which was covered 
with crumbs of meat, and lifted two empty shells of 
croquettes from it. 

" I see what has happened, Marta, but don't be dis- 
couraged. You have some mixture left, and you must 
do this over again for breakfast to-morrow. I can tell 
you the reason of this accident, and once we know the 
cause of a failure, it can easily be set right. Had it 
not been for that one perfect croquette I should have 
said that the fat might not have been hot enough ; that 
is a frequent cause of croquettes bursting, — they have 
time to melt inside before the crust is formed, but in this 
case the fault has been in the size. You must have 
made them too large. Don't you think that one, which 
is perfect, was smaller than the others ? " 

" Yes, it was. I was afraid that one was too small." 

" It was just right, you see, and after this I think 
you'll know. Before you put that croquette mixture 
away, Marta, keep out a large tea-spoonful, and after 
luncheon I will come and make some balls for soup." 

The veal stock Molly had carefully skimmed and 
strained in the morning, and intended to have a white 
soup for dinner. There was about a quart of strong 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 115 

jelly. One pint she put aside. It was so valuable that 
she did not mean to use a tea-spoonful more than neces- 
sary ; the pint, with half a pint of milk, would be all 
that was required for soup ; but as she had neither 
asparagus tops nor mushrooms nor celery to put in it, 
and veal soup is apt to be a little insipid without, she 
decided on forcemeat balls, made in the following way : 
To a large tea-spoonful of croquette mixture she added 
one of finely chopped parsley, as much thyme as would 
go on the end of a penknife, and a dessert-spoonful of 
bread crumbs ; she beat an egg^ and used enough only 
to make the whole into a soft paste ; this she seasoned 
rather highly with pepper and salt, and made into little 
balls not larger than marbles, and they were set away 
till wanted. 

As the soup was one Marta could not be expected to 
make, Molly went into the kitchen herself, half an hour 
before dinner, to do it; indeed, although she had left 
the cooking to Marta pretty much, she could not risk 
Harry's comfort by waiting for the dinner to straggle in 
as Marta would have had it. This seemed her chief 
failing, an inability to see the necessity of dishing up 
quickly. After she had cooked a thing well, she ran 
the risk of spoiling it by her slowness in getting it on 
the table. No mishap had yet occurred, because Molly 
was on hand to rescue ; but white sauce was left in the 
saucepan with risk of burning, and vegetables, after they 
were dressed, the same ; but Molly hoped that, in a few 
weeks, seeing the importance she herself attached to 
time might have its effect on Marta. 

The pint of veal stock, flavored, it will be remem- 
bered, with the vegetables boiled in it the day before, 
was put on to boil, and in a small saucepan she put a 
table-spoonful of butter and a scant one of flour, and 
stirred them together till they bubbled. She allowed 
them to cook together ybr a minute, stirring all the time, 
and called Marta's attention to the fact. 

"• The white sauce you made last, Marta, although 
very smooth, had a little raw taste ; this was because 



116 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

you added the milk before the flour was cooked suffi- 
ciently in the butter, — you put it in as soon as it bub- 
bled." 

" I was afraid it would burn." 

" Of course you must not let it do that, but you see, 
once it bubbles, I draw the saucepan to a cooler part 
and stir till the flour is on the point of changing color, 
then I quickly add the milk or broth. The sauce will 
be an ivory white instead of the rather dead white that 
even fairly good sauce often is." 

She poured the stock to the flour and butter and 
stirred till smooth, and then added half a pint of milk, — 
" and, as I have no cream, Marta, I kept the egg left 
from the forcemeat balls — I used very little of it — to 
add to this soup the last thing, just as you do for the 
bisque of clams." While the soup was all coming again 
to the boiling-point at the back of the range, Molly 
dropped the tiny forcemeat balls into boiling water, let 
them simmer half a minute, then strained them out and 
added them to the soup ; then, with a caution to Marta 
not to let the Qgg curdle, she went to add a few touches 
to her toilette before Harry came home. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 

BROILED lamb's KIDNEYS MRS. LENNOX STARTLED 

CORN-BEEF HASH. 

When Molly had said Marta was to make croquettes 
for breakfast, she had forgotten that she had kidneys in 
the house ; but, remembering it before she went to bed, 
she told Marta she would come down and broil them 
herself, which she accordingly did, knowing kidneys are 
very easily spoiled by bad cooking. 

She split each kidney down the back, or thick side, 
but did not sever the core or membrane, so that when 
opened they lay flat, but still in one. Then she ran a long 
skewer through the centre bit of fat and brought it out 
again, in such a manner that the kidney lay open flat 
under the skewer, which was attached to it only by that 
stitch through the middle ; then a second kidney was run 
on in the same way till they were all threaded, the 
skewer lying across them all ; but nowhere did it pierce 
the flesh of the kidney. This arrangement prevents the 
kidneys' curling up in unsightly fashion and secures their 
being equally cooked. 

They were laid on a hot gridiron, and a dish and 
plates made very hot to receive and serve them on ; and 
while Molly cooked them, Marta carried in breakfast, 
for kidneys are things that are spoiled by waiting. 

She turned them often for about four minutes. Dur- 
ing the process she had put in the little dish that was to 
receive them a piece of butter the size of a butternut, a 
level salt-spoonful of salt, a little pepper, and a tea-spoon- 
ful of Worcestershire sauce. When the kidneys were 
done they were removed from the skewer, and each well 
rolled in the hot butter and seasoning. They were just 



118 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

enough cooked in that four minutes for the gravy to start 
when tlie fork pricked them; if over-cooked they be- 
come tough. 

" Kidneys ! " cried Harry, as Molly removed the 
heated vegetable-dish-cover she had used to send them 
unchilled to table. " Dear Molly, where do you scare 
up these metropolitan dainties in the wilds of Jersey ? " 

" Nothing so easy ; actually, the butcher throws them 
in with his tallow, and seemed surprised that I wanted 
them." 

" I 'm afraid such ignorance can't last," said Harry 
" and when he finds lamb's kidneys are really very desir- 
able, he will value them accordingly." 

" No, not until he has customers who do ; and I sus- 
pect, although the man I buy from sells good meat, that 
he is not the fashionable butcher of Greenfield." 

" They are cooked to a turn, Moll3^" 

" I am glad. I should have had them on toast in the 
orthodox way, but knew you preferred fresh bread." 

In the afternoon Mrs. Lennox came with her work- 
basket to sew, while she paid Molly a visit. 

" I want to have a little talk with you, but can only 
spare the time if I bring some darning with me, so you 
will excuse me." 

"■' I am glad, for I also have my sewing," she said, 
and she colored a little as she displayed a dainty little 
garment. 

" I am so glad," said Mrs. Lennox ; and there was con- 
gratulation in the tone, although she said no more. 
" You have done me so much good since I have known 
you, Mrs. Bishop, that I feel I may trouble you a little 
further about my affairs without exhausting your pa- 
tience." 

" You certainly may, if I can do anything." 

" I must seem a perfect ignoramus to you, and yet 
I 'm an old married woman and you 're a young one ; 
but the fact is, I was married directly after I left school.

time. Mr. Lennox was full of hope that he would rise 
to great things, — all young writers are, — but, unluckily, 
the hard times of '73 came, and the magazine of which 
he was sub-editor, and which he hoped to edit, succumbed, 
and ever since then he has been forced to plod on, at 
what insures us bread. He has never dared to try for 
better things, and I know he frets at seeing me so over- 
worked, and has been telling me for years if I would sew 
less, and cook more, I should be better ; but first one 
must ' know how ' to cook, and I don't. There is one 
thing, however, I do see now, that I never did before ; 
and that is, that if I give my time to preparing the food, 
I can save enough to get the sewing I cannot do done 
for me. I never realized this before, but now I do. 
This is Friday, and we have lived nicely — I mean we 
have had food we enjoyed, and I have spent $2 less ; 
and the sewing I should have done in the time I have 
cooked would not have amounted to one full day's work, 
which I can get done for a dollar." 

" I am glad you see it so. I was sure of it, and I am 
sure that the effort to do so much sewing and the house- 
work, too, is far more wearing than double the quantity 
of either alone would be." 

*' Yes, because I dread to lose a minute, and the cook- 
ing always seemed such a loss." 

" I wonder you have not thought it cheaper to keep a 
servant." 

Mrs. Lennox dropped her work in her lap, and looked 
at Molly in astonishment. 

" Cheaper ! why, I should feel I was ruined at once." 

" Let us talk it over a bit, and see if my idea is right 
or yours. You pay a woman to wash ? " 

" Yes, I spend $8 a mouth in getting help, a dollar a 
week for washing, and the other dollar I divide be- 
tween the heavy ironing and roughest cleaning ; the rest 
I do myself." 

" And the ironing that is left is quite a day's work ? " 

" Well, it takes all my spare time on Tuesday ; and I 
have been running down so much lately, that I am afraid 
I cannot do it through next summer." 



120 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 

Molly looked at her. She did, indeed, look as if she 
were worn out. She could understand that doing all 
the work for her family, washing, even, included, was 
nothing extraordinary for some women ; but for this 
one. with her ambition to dress her children prettily, not 
to look poor as well as be poor, her fastidious husband, 
and her bringing-up, — it was an effort that was wearing 
her out. 

" Now this is the way I reckon," said Molly. " You 
can get a strong, newly landed girl, for six or eight dol- 
lars' a month. She may have nothing but health and 
industry, although I have known girls as capable as 
those who ask more, but more self-distrustful. Will not 
such a girl do more to help you for $8 the month thau 
you get now for that money ? " 

" Oh dear, yes. It seems to me if I had only some 
one to wash dishes every day I should be easy ; but 
you forget the food." 

" No, I do not ; but, really, if you have time to 
give your own attention to that, and you would have 
then, your food would cost less, even with one extra to feed 
than now. It would not be so if you had to get an extra 
large steak or chops each day for that one, but with the 
varied cooking you could then practice, you would find 
it make only such difference as you can easily make up 
in some other way ; for instance, you use baker's bread ; 
make it at home, and the difference in cost will be more 
than your girl will eat of it ; then, as all children like i-ye 
bread, use it once or twice a week. You will make your 
expensive flour go much farther. Then if rye is not liked, 
or they get tired, use one week Indian and wheat bread, 
another, rice bread. I don't think your husband or chil- 
dren would consider these breads anything but a treat, or 
know they came cheaper, and I should say nothing on that 
point till you found out their real tastes. One thing I 
don't want to advise ; and that is, the providing of any 
unpalatable or unwelcome food, be it ever so wholesome 
or cheap. Food eaten without relish is not wholesome ; 
and that is why, unless time is given to cooking, the coarser 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 121 

parts of meat are not economical, because they require 
careful cooking. A hurried, slap-dash way of preparing 
any part of meat spoils it. Only the finest steaks or 
chops are eatable, when so abused ; but it requires all 
their excellence to make them so." 

" I am taking in all you say. You have startled me 
wonderfully about the girl ; and the way you put it makes 
it seem as if it would be almost cheaper." 

" It would be as cheap, and your health would be better. 
You may not be lucky enough to meet with a good girl 
at first ; but we all run that risk, and I am sure of one 
thing : if you should give double the wages you would be 
equally exposed to it, and I am in favor of taking girls 
who have nothing to unlearn. I went on that plan with 
my Marta ; and, although she is not all I could wish, I 
don't think I should have done better by taking one 
who professed to know." 

" I don't think you could ; but she seems to me an 
exceptional girl." 

" Fortunately for me, she has a fondness for cooking, 
and seems thoroughly respectable ; but, if I had more 
work in my house, I should not be able to keep her ; so 
1 am hoping you may be able to find one equally good 
and a little quicker, if you resolve to make the trial." 

" I would like, but I am afraid. I have always heard 
that a servant increases the expenses out of all propor- 
tion to what she eats." 

" Of course, if servants are left to themselves in their 
inexperience, they waste far more than they consume; 
but you will oversee everything." 

*' And then I shall get the reputation of being dread- 
fully stingy." 

'* What matter ? You might be wasteful, and still be 
called so by those who wish to do it ; but economy is not 
stint. I am sure you will never look more keenly after 
odds and ends than I do." 

Mrs. Lennox looked incredulous. 

" It is true. If there is one potato left I have it put 
away ; one spoonful of rice, a fag end of beefsteak. Al- 



122 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

though I am new to keeping house in this country, I am 
an old housekeeper ; for my mother left everything to me, 
and, our means being small, and she fastidious (by which 
I mean only that she could do without anything, better 
than have it second rate), I had to set my wits to work ; 
and I 've too often known the time when one potato was 
just the thing to finish, or make her a little dish, to de- 
spise it." 

"But how?" 

Molly laughed. " Impossible to say, for one never 
knows what may happen ; but I can tell you what it 
once did. My mother and I lived alone, and so rarely 
had joints of meat that we seldom had much more than 
enough in the house for our needs, in the way of fresh 
meats, but potted dainties we always had. However, one 
wet, chilly evening, a visitor arrived unexpectedly, an 
American traveling, and he had come considerably out 
of his way to see us for a half an hour. I was at my 
wits' end, for our solitary maid had her holiday, and we 
were about to sit down to a cozy cup of tea and toast, 
with some anchovy paste and a little fruit. All we had 
in the house was a few slices of corned beef, not present- 
able, for they had been cut off for tea the night before. 
Now I knew our friend expected no dinner ; and to give 
him as good a one as a French cook could send up would 
be no treat, for he was leading a hotel life. The only 
thing he would really enjoy would be some real American 
dish. There was little time, for he had to catch a train 
in an hour. I flew down-stairs in despair. I must have 
something hot to set before him. I looked at the safe ; 
there were about a cup of cold mush, a solitary potato of 
good size, and a few half-dried scraps of corned beef. I 
took them all into the kitchen, blessing the French char- 
coal stoves, which are always ready, and, arranging the 
oven for baking, I chopped my beef, then the potato, 
not too fine. When done there were a cup of beef and 
rather less of potato. I put some beef-dripping into a 
pan, and set it to get hot ; and into a saucepan put the 
beef and potato mixed, and a little salt and pepper, and 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 123 

stirred them round ; and then I added a small half cup of 
thick cream. While this was heating, I cut the mush 
in slices, floured each, and when the dripping was smoking 
hot I laid them in ; I tasted the hash, and found it just 
right. There was no time to brown it ; but I left it long 
enough for the cream to dry sufficiently away, while I 
beat the yolks of four eggs and the whites to a stiff froth, 
then added to the yolks a little salt and three table-spoon- 
fuls of milk, stirred the whites to them gently, and then 
took up the hash. The mush, which I had turned, was 
now pale brown ; and I laid it round the dish on which 
was the hash, then poured the fat from the saucepan, put 
a bit of butter in it, and when it melted, which, as the pan 
was already very hot, it did in a moment, I poured in the 
eggs. Happily, the table was ready, and my mother 
always made tea on it ; so I waited only to split a few 
pickled gherkins to garnish the hash, and then my omelet 
being half set I put it, pan and all, in the oven, while I 
carried my Yankee dish to table. I had been absent 
only twenty minutes ; everything was ready, and, while 
the traveller's tea was being poured out, I ran down 
and doubled my omelet over and turned it out. I am 
quite sure nothing short of canvas-back ducks, or New 
England turkey and cranberry sauce, could have been 
such a success as that hash." 

" ' Dear Mrs. Holmes,' our friend said to my mother, 
' I assure you I have dreamed of corned-beef hash and 
fried mush, and longed for them many times when the 
table has been groaning with every French dainty, and 
believed I could not hope to eat them on this side of the 
Atlantic' 

" Since that time I never think anything too small to 
save ; it comes in when least expected ; and, had my 
cooked potato not been there, I could have made no 
hash." 



CHAPTER XIX. 

SUMMARY lamb's HEART — FLOUNDERS CORNED 

BEEF CANNELON OF BEEF. 



It has been said that Molly was providing for visitors 
by economizing slightly in her table. She was always 
economical, but it made some difference whether the fish 
she bought was the inexpensive flounder, made by the 
art of good cooking into the aristocratic j/z/e^ de sole, or 
what passes for such where veritable sole is not to be 
bought for money, or a more expensive sort ; whether 
she used veal instead of chicken, or clams in place of 
oysters, and tomato or potato salad for lettuce. On 
Saturday, after Sunday's marketing was done, her ^ac- 
count stood thus : —

It will be remembered that Monday's dinner was 
formed, with the addition of oysters, from what was left 
on Sunday ; and therefore the lamb bought on Monday 
did not come into use till Tuesday, when three chops 
were used for breakfast, and the slioulder for the even- 
ing dinner. 

Substituting, then, the lamb for the steak of the Tues- 
day before, and on Wednesday using lamb's liver in 
place of the roast breast which was used on Thursday, the 
bills of fare were substantially the same as those of the 
preceding week, until Friday, when stuffed lamb's heart 
for breakfast, and corned beef and flounders and beets 
for dinner, were new items, as was also the steak for 
Saturday, in place of the cutlets. Dessert and puddings 
of the first week were repeated. 

Twice Molly had found in market green corn young 
enough for their taste, and had bought half a dozen ears. 
The beets, also, were moderate enough in price now to 
come within Molly's purse. Needless to say, all arti- 
cles which were expensive, only because too early or too 
late in season, had to be eschewed ; but in autumn, in 
the country, where vegetables are rarely so plentiful as 
in New York, the market needs watching. One grocer 
may have a stray basket of string beans, quite young, or 
a few dozen of sweet corn, long after they have disap- 
peared generally ; and these are often quite cheap. 

Molly had chosen a cheap part of corned beef — the 
plate — in preference to the round, at double the price : 
properly boiled, she liked it better. A small piece of 
four or five pounds of round of beef is very dry, even if 
the careful boiling prevents its being hard ; therefore she 
got four pounds and a half at eight cents. She knew, 
from her cooking - school experience, the New York 
price was seven cents ; but she had learned that most 
things were a little dearer in Greenfield. As she wrote 
down the recipes for cooking the heart, the corned beef, 
the flounders, and steak, I give them in that form. 

Lamb's Heart Baked. — The heart, which came 
with the lamb's Jiver, instead of being cut up and fried 



126 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

in dry rings, as it is usually done, was cleansed of blood, 
the gristle (or " deaf ear ") cut away, and a veal stuffing 
made of a heaped table-spoonful of bread crumbs, a small 
tea-spoonful of parsley chopped very fine, and a pinch, 
between thumb and finger, of thyme, pepper and salt. 
Make this into a paste with butter by working a piece the 
size of a walnut into it, then fill the cavity in the heart 
with it ; cut two thin slices of fat pork, wrap the heart 
-in them, flour it and put it in a hot oven, in a small 
dish. Bake it twenty minutes, turning often so that it 
will be quite brown. Take it up, pour into the dish a 
very little boiling water or gravy (Molly had some of 
her veal stock), season nicely ; if water is used, add a few 
drops of sauce or catsup ; stir it well round the little 
dish to remove dried gravy, then serve with the heart, 
which thus makes a very appetizing dish. 

The corned beef was washed, and, as the butcher had 
told Molly it was only moderately salt, she did not soak 
it. 

Boiled Corned Beef. — Although it was quite a 
small piece, Molly intended it to come so very slowly to 
the boil that she had it put on the stove in cold water 
at two o'clock. The water was only at the boiling-point 
at three, and it was kept till six so slowly cooking that 
one had to look carefully in order to see that there was 
any movement in the water at all. At six it was taken 
up, and the bones drawn out, the rough edges trimmed 
off, carrpt and turnip cones set round it, and boiled cab- 
bage served with it. After dinner, it was put between 
two dishes, and two heavy flatirons set on it, and it was 
allowed to get cold under pressure, in order that it might 
cut in neat slices. 

Young Beets Boiled. — The beets to be carefully 
washed, the roots not cut off" at all, and the tops left an 
inch long ; the idea is to prevent the skin being broken 
in any way. Put them in boiling water, and, if they 
are of average size, one hour will boil them tender. 
Try, without a fork, by pressing in a cloth ; then pour 
the water off, and peel and slice them (or they can be

left whole if preferred), and make the following sauce : 
A dessert-spoonful of butter, a scant one of flour ; let them 
bubble one minute, put to them a scant half-pint of wa- 
ter ; let it boil, season with pepper and salt, and then put 
in a large tea-spoonful more butter ; stir tiJl mixed, and 
add the juice of half a lemon; put the beets in this 
sauce, and let all come to a gentle boil together. 

To Bone Flounders, and prepare as filet de sole • 
Take- a flounder weighing as near two pounds as possi- 
ble, — if too small they will make poor filets, — have 
the head removed, lay it on the board before you, and 
with a sharp knife make a cut right down the middle of 
the back, from neck to tail, letting the knife touch the 
bone all the way ; then run the knife carefully between 
the flesh and the bones, working always towards the 
edge or fin, and keeping close to the bone ; you have now 
detached one quarter of the flesh. Do the other side in 
the same way, and when the side uppermost is thus en- 
tirely loose from the bone, turn the fish over, and do the 
same with the other part. You will now find you can 
remove the bone whole from the fish. You have now 
two halves of the fish ; cut away the fins, and you have 
four quarters of solid flesh, or filets. Lay each one, skin 
downward, in front of you ; hold the end of the filet 
firmly, and with the knife cut the filet from the skin by 
pressing the edge of the knife downward on the skin, 
which you hold firmly with thumb and finger, and push- 
ing, as it were, the flesh up from it. You will find the 
skin and flesh will separate without destroying the shape 
of the filet. Now bread them ; have either a good sup- 
ply of bread crumbs dried in the oven and sifted, or 
cracker meal ; beat an egg with a table-spoonful of water, 
lay each filet in it, both sides, then lift it out and lay it 
in the crumbs ; turn it over that both may be well cov- 
ered, and press gently ; then lay it aside, and do the 
other three. Have enough fat in a deep pan to cover 
them ; let it get very hot, trying it with a bit of bread. 
If it brown at once, put the filets in, two at a time ; have 
brown paper ready, and lay them on it when they are a 
fine golden brown, and serve on a hot dish. 



128 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

Stewed Cannelon of Beef, or Rolled Steak. — 
Take a piece of the upper side of the rouud of beef, cut 
broad and thick. Make a veal stuffing in the following 
way : A cup of fine bread crumbs, a scant table-spoonful 
of finely chopped parsley, and a very scant tea-spoonful 
of thyme and marjoram mixed (if any one objects to 
either of these herbs, leave it out), a very little nutmeg, 
a half tea-spoonful of salt, and a half salt-spoonful of 
pepper ; chop or mix all together wnth a good table- 
spoonful of butter ; lay the steak on a board, and with a 
large knife hack it closely across and across, all over on 
one side only, then along the centre of the hacked side 
lay the stuffing ; roll the meat over and fasten it with 
toothpicks to keep it, while 30U envelop it in thin slices 
of fat pork, round which you wind twine. When neat 
and compact, lay it in a saucepan with a pint of water, 
and a piece of carrot and onion cut fine, a salt-spoonful 
of salt, and a tea-spoonful of vinegar. Let this simmer 
very gently for three hours, closely covered, then take 
it up, lay it in a baking-pan, remove the strings and 
toothpicks very carefully, dredge it all over very thinly 
with flour, and set it in a very hot oven to brown 
quickly. If the saucepan was kept closely covered, and 
the simmering slow, there will be at least half a pint 
of thick, rich gravy in it ; which strain, and skim free 
from fat (a table-spoonful of cold water thrown in will 
make it easier to skim). When the meat is brown, pour 
this gravy round it, and serve. If the gravy should 
have dried away too much, a little boiling water may be 
put into the saucepan, and well stirred, before straining, — 
but a little rich gravy is better than much and poor. 

This dish Molly prepared herself, and it was a great 
success. Harry pronounced it better than Jilet de boeuf. 

" Yes, it is either a very good dish, or a wofully bad 
one, — hard and dry and altogether unsatisfactory. " 

But Molly knew it depended so entirely on great 
care, that the meat should be hacked thoroughly, yet not 
anywhere cut through, and then so very slowly sim- 
p, ff'."^, so quickly browned, that she thought it one of 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 129 

those dishes she would always have to cook herself. 
She was not expecting too much from Marta. If she 
profited by her instructions sufficiently to know the rules 
of cooking, and abide by them so far that she might be 
trusted not to spoil a dish if left to watch it, and be able 
to cook a few things well, so that she could do when 
necessary unaided, — that was all Molly looked for.

CHAPTER XX. 

PREPARING A CHICKEN GIBLETS SPOILT BREAD. 

While the beefsteak, on Saturday, was being con- 
verted into such a savory dish, Molly, who wished to 
oversee the simmering, took that time to prepare the 
chicken. The one used for the pie, last Sunday, she 
had prepared, while Marta was busy elsewhere ; this 
week she wanted to show her how it was to be neatly 
done. 

She had ordered the chicken (or rather, yearling fowl ; 
for it weighed over three pounds, and Molly was not 
paying the price of chicken in September) to be sent 
home with the feet on^ for two reasons : first, because the 
butcher usually chops them off at the joint, or above it, 
when they should be taken off just below, else when 
roasted the flesh shrinks up, and they display an un- 
sightly bare bone ; and, secondly, because the feet, prop- 
erly prepared, are too valuable, for gravy, to lose. 

Molly began by picking over the bird to remove a 
few stray feathers ; then she took off the stove-lid, put 
some paper in the fire, and quickly moved the bird over 
the flame, taking care not to blacken the skin. 

" Now, Marta, if you are ready, 1 want you to pay 
great attention, because if you can clean a fowl you can 
also clean a duck, goose, or turkey ; the process is the 
same, and either, improperly done, though you may re- 
move everything that ought not to remain in it, will 
never taste the same. If the entrails are broken, it im- 
parts the odor of the barnyard to the whole. 

" You see I cut the neck off close to the body, leaving 
as little of it on as I can ; but, before beginning to cut, 
push the skin well down toward the body, so that there 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 131 

will be plenty of skin to cover the place where the neck 
has been. Cut off tlie feet just below the joint ; then cut 
the skin at the back of the neck, an inch or so down, 
and with your forefinger loosen the crop all round, and 
take it out without breaking or emptying it. Next cut 
a slit right under the rump, large enough to run two 
fingers in. If this were a goose or turkey, you would 
need it large enough to admit your whole hand into the 
body. Before attempting to draw out the entrails, 
loosen with your finger all the tiny strings that attach 
them to the body. Be certain your fingers can pass be- 
tween the contents of the stomach and the body in every 
direction without obstruction ; then bend your hand or 
fingers round the mass, and draw it forward ; this will 
bring the whole out in a ball. Be careful not to drag it 
by any particular part, or you will break the entrails, 
and the whole process be an unclean one ; or you may 
spoil the fowl by breaking the gall, the bitter of which 
cannot be washed away. Cut off the vent, which will 
free the main entrail. If properly managed, the bird 
will be quite clean inside, aud need only wiping with a 
wet cloth ; if not clean, pour lukewarm water through 
it.*' 

Molly worked while she talked, suiting the action to 
the word when possible ; and when the entrails of the 
fowl lay on the table, quite unbroken, she showed 
Marta the clean inside. 

"You see this needs washing neither inside nor out; 
and that is the great object, — to prevent the contents 
of the entrails getting on the bird ; for if they do, to 
my mind, no amount of washing will cleanse it." 

" Now I lay the bird aside, and prepare the giblets, 
which make gravy. You see this small, dark-green 
bladder attached to the liver ? That is the gall. I cut 
it off, but am careful to leave a bit of the liver with it 
to avoid breaking. Put the liver in cold water. This 
hard, silvery-blue lump is the gizzard ; it must be freed 
from all skin and strings ; and by cutting it carefully on 
the wide side, without penetrating the inner skin, it can 



132 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

be peeled off, leaving the inside whole, thus avoiding 
the usual mess. This outer flesh throw into the water 
with the liver. Now for the feet." 

Molly put them in a quart bowl, and poured water 
from the kettle — which she was careful to see was 
actually boiling — upon them, covering them all over. 

" Now, Marta, if you do this yourself, never attempt 
to scald with water that is not boiling, however near the 
point it may be ; and do not put them in hot water and 
set them on the stove to come to the boiling-point. 
P^ither of these methods will so set the skin that it will 
not come off without the flesh, while these, you see, will 
peel easilj^ enougli." She had taken, as she spoke, a 
clean cloth in one hand, and with a fork lifted one of 
the feet out of the hot water, then quickly rubbed the 
thin, yellow skin, which came off as readily as the skin 
from a ripe, scalded tomato ; then she bent back each 
nail and that, too, came off, leaving the foot delicate, 
white, and clean. The rest were done in the same way. 
" The only thing necessary is great quickness ; the skin 
gets ' set ' as the water cools. 

" You can put the fowl away now till to-morrow, 
Marta, but the giblets I will put on to stew for gravy. 
Here are the feet, the heart, the neck, gizzard, and liver, 
all well cleaned. They need a pint of water, a slice of 
onion, a piece of carrot, as big as your thumb, cut in it, 
half a tea-spoonful of salt, and a sprig of parsley. Now 
if I had not these vegetables in the house, I should do 
without ; but having them, the gravy will be much 
better. Let these giblets stew down very slowly, till 
only half remains ; then strain, and you will find it is a 
solid jelly, when cold. 

"Ah, Marta, what is the matter with the bread? and 
how comes it so late to-day ? " 

Marta was just taking from the oven the one loaf 
which formed the tri-weekly baking, and at a glance 
Molly knew it was a failure. It was a peculiar color, 
— a drab tone, instead of the bright, yellow brown it 
should have been, — and it looked flat. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 133 

" That T don't UTiflerstand," said Marta ; '^ it seemed 
to-day as if it would never rise." 

It must here be said that after IMolly showed Marta 
bread-making, her bread had been very good. Slie had 
made it tliree times so well that Molly thought that 
part of her teaching was over. This was the fourth 
time, and it was evidently a failure. 

She thought of all she had heard from experienced 
housekeepers, — how thankless a task it was to teach 
servants, for when they attain perfection, they lack the 
ambition to keep to the mark ; they " run down," as it 
\s(tYQ. For a moment Molly was appalled at the pros- 
pect of working so hard and faithfully with Marta, if it 
was to end thus ; and then she remembered, if it should 
prove so in this case, it could not be possible that some 
girl would not be wise enough to see the advantage to 
herself of keeping up to a standard. 

" Even if I have to change several times, at last I 
certainly shall find one who repays me ; then I shall 
have a year or two of peace and comfort." 

But she did not make up her mind to the worst about 
Marta from this failure. It had been gradually becom- 
ing clear to her that Marta had some good qualities and 
many faults. Whether the qualities balanced the faults 
was something she had seriously to consider when she 
had had longer trial ; and which would depend much on 
whether, once knowing a thing thoroughly, she could 
be trusted to do it. 

•' Marta, nothing of this sort can happen without a 
cause; try to think what it can be." Molly studiously 
refrained from showing her vexation, for she really 
wanted to find out whether Marta had erred through 
carelessness or ignorance ; and the only way to get at 
the facts was, not to frighten her into deception by 
seeming angry. 

"I cannot think, unless the yeast was not good; I 
was very careful." 

" Get me the rest of the cake of yeast." 

When she brought it, Molly broke it. It broke off

short, and smelt quite good ; had it been stale it would 
have pulled like dough, or smelt bad. 

"No, the yeast is good, and in proof of it I must 
make something else with it. But I think you must 
have put it in too hot water." As she spoke she had cut 
the loaf. " This looks just like bread made with scalded 
yeast, or that had risen too slowly from having too little 
yeast." 

" No, ma'am, I am sure the water was not too hot." 

" And it could not have been chilled when you set it 
to rise, I know. Ah, there 's one thing, Marta ! perhaps 
you forgot to stir the yeast after you dropped it in the 
water, or did not do it sufficiently, and it remained at 
the bottom and never went into the bread at all." 

This seemed the certain solution, if what Marta said 
about the water was true ; but the girl shook her head. 

" No, I am sure I stirred it, and it all went into the 
flour." 

Molly looked at her, — could she be telling the truth ? 
If she had not known the bread had had long enough to 
rise^ she would have thought it had been put into the 
oven direct^ the dough was in the pan, without being 
allowed to rise ; but that she knew could not be, for she 
had seen it rising, and wondered why it should be so 
late. She wished now she had asked before it was 
baked ; but Marta had been out of the way, and when 
she returned to the kitchen the matter had slipped from 
her mind. 

" I have told you to warm the flour. I suppose you 
did n't make it very hot." 

" No ; I did everything just as you showed me.'* 

Molly said nothing. Marta must be untruthful ; this 
was a more unpleasant thing to discover than the failure 
of the bread. 

" Well, we must have bread ; it is four o'clock, and 
Saturday. I will make a rye loaf, because it needs to 
rise only once after it is mixed, and by seven o'clock it 
will be ready to bake." 

Molly measured the flour and set it to warm (she 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 135 

meant to make this bread herself, because she was much 
quicker than Marta). As she poured the hot water into 
the cold, to make the right temperature for the yeast, a 
thought struck her ; — she always dissolved the yeast in 
the tin pint measure, and Marta did the same. 

" Marta, after you put the yeast in the water, did you 
set it on the stove ? " 

*' Yes, ma'am, the water was a little cool, and I set it 
there to dissolve ; but I did not let it get a bit hot, and 
it was quite back of the stove." 

"That is the mystery then!" Molly had remem- 
bered hearing a lady speak of having done the same 
thing herself ; and though it was back of the stove, and 
the water could not get hotter, the yeast, being at the 
bottom in contact with the hot iron, had baked or 
scalded. Of one thing she was very glad ; Marta had 
immediately owned 'the fact, and the failure had not 
come from her neglect of any of the rules Molly had 
laid down, — only from not understanding cause and 
effect. 



CHAPTER XXL 

TO MAKE A FOWL TENDER AS SPRING CHICKEN. 

As I have said, the fowl was a yearling, and Molly 
meant to try with it an experiment she had seen prac- 
ticed in France, by which fowls, not quite young, were 
made very tender, without being converted into fricassee 
or pot-pie. On Sunday morning, before going to church, 
she had taken a large sheet of soft paper, and, after 
twisting the wings over on tlie back, and forcing the 
legs up against the body snugly, securing them there 
with skewer and twine, and fastening the skin of the 
neck neatly on the back with a toothpick, she seasoned 
it and wrapped it entirely in the paper, which was large 
enough to cover it twice. She then tied it up with 
twine. 

" Marta, put this chicken in the oven at half past 
eleven ; that is, half an hour earlier than if it were a 
young chicken. Let the oven be hot, and, at a quarter 
past twelve, remove the paper. Take care to let all the 
grease that may be in it run into the pan ; flour the 
fowl a little, and set it back in the oven and roast it. 
Take care to turn it often, and let it get well browned ; 
when you take it up, remove skewer and string, pour 
the gravy from the giblets, with the liver and gizzard 
chopped ver}' fine, into the dripping-pan ; set it over the 
stove, season, and, if it should not look a nice rich brown, 
put about two drops of caramel in it. Send the gravy 
to table in a sauce-boat." 

Marta promised to follow directions carefully, and 
Molly left the kitchen ; and then, remembering a mis- 
take Marta might make, hastened back. 

" I told you to Jiour it, but I mean only to shake a 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 137 

very little over it from the dredger ; if it is at all thick 
there will be a white, pasty coating on the outside, in- 
stead of a crisp, brown one." 

After church Molly went to the kitchen to see if 
everything was going right, and saw on the table a cup- 
ful of pretty yellow balls. " What are these ? " she 
asked, taking one up, but found it collapsed between her 
fingers. It was simply a wind ball, and the outside as 
thin as paper. 

" They are German noodles for soup," said Marta, 
her face beaming with pride. 

"They are very pretty; and, though I know several 
sorts of noodles, I have never seen these." 

At dinner the clear soup, with the addition of Marta's 
noodles, was excellent, and she found that steaming the 
fowl in paper, before baking, agreed just as well with 
the American bird as a French one ; the limbs fell from 
under the knife, as Harry carved, and the oft despised 
yearling might have rivalled the youngest and juiciest 
spring chicken. 



CHAPTER XXII. 

DOLLARS AND CENTS. 

Molly reached the end of her first month's house- 
keeping, and now could see exactly where she stood, 
and could plan for the coming month to advantage. Re- 
ferring to her note-book, she found she had spent 53 
cents less the second week than the first, 75 cents less 
the third, and 60 cents less the fourth. She had, there- 
fore, in hand nearly $2, and provisions in the house for 
a couple of days. She had also salad-oil, olives, Worces- 
tershire sauce, cooking-wine, pepper, salt, mustard, corn 
meal, and vinegar, to last a month at least. There was 
also over a pound of coffee left ; and she would need 
only three pounds of lard in place of five, as there was 
nearly half left, and two instead of four pounds of coffee. 
She had, therefore, that much to deduct from her second 
month's grocery bill, and several additions to make to it, 
for she had so far done without many articles she liked 
to have in the house ; she found, too, that the twelve 
pounds of sugar she had allowed must be increased to 
fifteen, twelve granulated, three cut loaf. 

Her order for the grocer stood for the second month 
thus : — 

Three pounds loaf sugar .... $0.30 
Twelve pounds granulated sugar . . .96 

Flour 1.00 

Kerosene 1.00 

Potatoes 40 

Lard 36 

Coffee 60

Molly had carefully saved the peels of all lemonsy 
used in the past month, which had not been grated. As 
they were squeezed, the pulp was scraped out, and then 
they were dropped into a gem-jar of salt and water, a 
handful of salt to the quart. She meant to do the same 
with oranges, through the winter, and to candy them. 
A cup of candied lemon or orange peel is a great addi- 
tion to a fruit cake or to many puddings ; and, as the 
only cost was the sugar used in candying it, she would 
always keep a good supply in her store-closet. The 
alcohol was to make lemon flavoring ; and, as soon as it 
came, she took a fresh lemon with a coarse rind, and with 
a sharp knife carefully pared off the yellow as thin as 
possible ; this, cut into small pieces, she put into the alco- 
hol, then corked it tightly. In two or three weeks this 
would be very fragrant extract of lemon, growing 
stronger the longer it was kept. The extract of rose, 
of vanilla, and of almond, she bought of the druggist ; 



140 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

they were much stronger than those put up in bottles, 
and of course very much cheaper, and the ten cents' 
worth would last months. The extract of rose was to 
take the place of rose-water in flavoring cakes or icing; 
a very few drops would suffice. 

" Now," thought Molly, as she surveyed her new stock 
of provisions, " I can have some variety in dessert and 
cakes, and these little bottles will work wonders in my 
commissariat. Charlotte and I will have a real good 
time when she comes." 

" Charlotte " was Mrs. "Welles; and she was to come 
the second week in October, when the hills would be in 
the full glory of autumn color ; and Molly was full of 
anticipation of pleasure in having her old friend in her 
own house. 

" That alone pays for all the extra care and work of 
housekeeping," she had said to Harry, — "the pleasure 
of asking your friends to your own house instead of some 
one else's." 

" Oh, it 's a paying thing in every way," said Harry. 
" I confess I 'm completely converted." 

Harry had kept up his little jokes about their house- 
keeping ; had laughed gently over her weekly savings, 
and still more when she told him it was to meet the 
extra expense of visitors. 

" But, Harry," she had said earnestly, " we must do 
that, you know, or else get just as much behind as I am 
now before-hand. Of course, if vv^e were a large family 
keeping a bountiful house, one more or less would not 
need providing for ; but when just two are living as well 
as they know how, on a certain sum, that amount will 
not stretch to take in extra. Every one who manages 
has to calculate so ; only perhaps I need not have spoken 
of it. Many things are all right until they are spoken, 
and then they do, 1 confess, sound very small. Of course, 
if we cooked a large roast to-day, ate it cold two or three 
days, baked once a week several loaves, and had large 
pots of weak coffee, half to be thrown away, we should 
not need to provide very much for a visitor ; but we aim 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 141 

to live differently ; and it is only by making one thing fit 
in with another that we can live quite within our means, 
and be able to welcome a visitor without anxiety." 

Molly was Hushed, and her eyes sparkled ; for she was 
a little wounded. 

*' My dearest little woman, you mistook me ; I was n't 
laughing at the planning at all ; I was laughing in admi- 
ration at the way you steered your little bark so very 
near the wind, and trimmed so very neatly. And to 
think, too, how clever you were to cut down the table-ex- 
penses after the first week without my guessing it. I 
declare, I thought I was living quite like a prince. I 
am lost in admiration, Molly, and feel ashamed to be so 
much better off than most fellows." 

He spoke in a sort of jesting earnest, and pressed 
Molly to him. She understood him well ; the slight 
cloud lifted, and, with his arm about her, they went over 
the month's accounts together. 

" Now do you regret the experiment of housekeep- 
ing?" she asked, when he had congratulated her. 

" No, indeed, I don't. No more boarding for me if I 
know it." 

" I am so thankful to hear you say that." 

" Now, my dear, you 've had your little innings, lis- 
ten to mine. I have $20 a month, remember, to give an 
account of. You know we set out, when we married, 
with the brave purpose of reserving $10 a month for 
emergencies. But with board and laundress coming to 
nearly $90, and the numberless trifling expenses, car 
fares, etc., in New York, in the whole twelve months we 
did not save $10." 

"• I know, and it worried me very much ; to live right 
up to one's income seems terrible." 

" Not so terrible in our case, because I 'm sure of a 
steadily increasing salary ; and I propose we do not in- 
crease our expenses for some years to come." 

" Oh, no indeed ! Whatever the increase, it must be 
saved so long as we have health." 

" Well, I find by living in the country that drain of 



142 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

small expenses is avoided; and I actually have SI 2 in 
hand." 

" Oh, I am so thankful, but " — anxiously — " you 
have not been going without lunch ? " 

'' By no means ; but I find fruit or a sandwich and 
glass of milk makes me as good a lunch as I want, and 
averages ten cents a day." 

Harry's commutation ticket was S6 a month, $3 only 
of which had to come from the margin of $20. (It 
will be remembered that the amount they allowed for 
their rent, servants, and table was 377. The $3 saved 
from their old boarding-house expense of $80 partly 
paid the commutation ticket.) Harry had therefore 
limited his personal expenses to $5 for lunch and news- 
papers, tobacco, etc. Molly was very proud each time 
she remembered how freely he had spent money before 
their marriage, and how cheerfully he had resigned the 
cigars and expensive luxuries that were almost second 
nature, for her sake. How could she grudge any pains 
that should make his house a little like the one he had 
been accustomed to ? They had both decided to be 
very economical in dress ; and it is astonishing how very 
little will keep up a wardrobe once well supplied, pro- 
vided one does not easily tire of the same garments. Al- 
together Molly thought the outlook was bright enough ; 
and, after thus summing up, they spent a long, happy 
evening laying plans. 

" Oh, what is your conclusion about our light-handed 
Phyllis ; will you keep her ? " 

" Oh yes ; she certainly is rather exasperating some- 
times, and I have thought it over seriously whether I 
should take the trouble to go on with her or change ; but 
she has some very good qualities ; she is very clean, and 
very saving, and really about cooking very intelligent. 
Outside of the kitchen I can't say much for her; but 
another might be stupid there, too, so I think I '11 bear 
the ills I know." 

Marta's wages were but $10; but Molly had found 
it absolutely necessary to hire a woman for two days, 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 143 

that Marta might see how washing and ironing was to 
be accomplished in this country, which Molly herself 
knew little about. She knew what the result should be, 
but how to attain it she did not know. When the woman 
came, she was careful to profit, herself. She watched the 
process, and asked the woman a dozen questions. 

" It seems to me that Marta rubs enough and works 
hard enough, but nothing looks just right," she had said, 
as she watched the apparently easy movements of Mrs. 
Hall, who was considered an excellent laundress. 

" Lor bless you, ma'am, it ain't the rubbin' with 
clothes like your'n, it 's the rinsin', and the washin' in 
plenty of water — many ov 'em stuff the tub just full 
of clothes as they can pack, and then puddle them all 
through in a little water one side the tub, when it's just 
as easy to have a few bits in at a time. Then when 
they 're a bilin', the biler 's chuck full, and no room for 
'em to scald ; and they 're put right out of the bilin' suds 
into the blue rinse water, 'stead ov bein' suddled first." 

" What is suddled ? " 

" Well, just being put into a tub ov clear or near clear 
water, an' gettin' the soap out of 'em ; then they kin be 
tossed into the rinse." 

" You think, then, it 's not the labor, but the water?" 

" Stan's to reason, if the does come out of thick water, 
— I don't mean dirty ; your does would n't make dirty 
water if you was to try, — they '11 look thick." 

This was a great thing for Molly to know. She saw 
the principle of it, and she knew Marta grudged no 
work ; it was only that she did not expend it in the right 
direction. Less rubbing, but more water, then, was no 
doubt the secret. 

With ironing she learned less, Mrs. Hall's views on 
the matter being of the Bunsby kind. Molly had been 
reading all she could find in books about it, but she be- 
lieved a few words from a practical laundress would en- 
lighten her more than much reading. She had only one 
clear idea herself ; and that was that the most beautiful 
laundry-work she had ever seen, she had been told, was 
due to lonar boiliuop of the starch. 



144 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" I boil it till it runs off the sjDOon like melted silver," 
the woman who did it told her. 

" What do you think about starch ? Ought it to be 
long boiled ? " she asked Mrs. Hall. 

*' Oh, I don't know. Some says so, some says not, but 
I never makes no differ ; if I 'm not ready the starch 
biles, if I am, it don't. It 's all in the ironin', I say ; if 
you kin iron, you kin." 

" But surely sometimes starch sticks." 

" Yes, if you don't understand it." 

Molly gave up ; but she found Marta so far improved 
by what she had seen, that the money was well ex- 
pended. 

But to return to the dollar and cent question. Her 
grocery bill for the coming mouth was $10.02 against 
$11.22 for the last (see Chapter IX.), and the weekly 
proportion of that would be $2.50J. Of several arti- 
cles, such as flour and potatoes, she had renewed the 
supply ; not because they were really exhausted, but 
would be in a few daj^s ; all of which small " lap-overs," 
however, would make a little difference to one who 
watched her expenses so closely as Molly. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

CHIEFLY SOCIAL — MRS. FRAMLEY's OPINIONS. 

Molly during the month had become acquainted with 
all Mr. and Mrs. Winfield's friends ; they had gone to 
the " readings " each week, and, not being hypocritical 
young people, but very ready to be amused, had enjoyed 
themselves much. The " readings," she found, were 
really modified theatricals ; and as happily no great 
tragedies or legitimate dramas were attempted, but bright 
comedies or farces, they were usually well done; and 
where they were not the fun was greater, 

Molly was glad they had found so many pleasant peo- 
ple in Greenfield ; it made the ordeal of a winter in the 
country for Harry far less trying. She was expressing 
an idea of this sort to Mrs. Framley, who said : — 

" But you don't seem to think the ordeal is as great 
for you, who are in the country all day. I 'm afraid you 
spoil Mr. Bishop." 

" Oh dear, no," laughed Molly ; " but I do think it 
right to make life just as pleasant to him as I can." 

" My dear, don't you think women do too much of 
that ? Is n't it just as much a man's business to see that 
his wife enjoys herself as hers to cater to his amuse- 
ment? You told me the other day you don't care for 
chess ; yet you make a point of playing it. Why should n't 
Mr. Bishop make a point of doing something you like?" 

" I don't know ; but I don't believe he would think of 
it ; if he did, no doubt he would tiy to amuse me." 

" That 's just it ! You are so self-effacing that it 
does n't occur to him. I am no woman's rights woman ; 
I don't want to vote ; but I do not believe in catering to 
a husband's taste any more than he caters to mine." 



146 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" I have n't thought much about it," said Molly slowly. 
" It just comes natural to me to do what I can to please 
Harry, but I don't know that it is any credit to me, for 
I enjoy it just as much as he does ; perhaps if I did n't I 
mi^ht not do it." 

'' Well, you are newly married, but later you will find 
you have made him thoroughly selfish ; at least, he is a 
remarkable young man if he does n't get so. Look at 
Jane Carlyle ! " 

Molly laughed. " I love Mrs. Carlyle, and I am al- 
ways surprised at the tone of commiseration adopted 
toward her. I think she thoroughly enjoyed ministering 
to her husband — why should n't she ? She loved and 
admired him, and it was her life work ; and I think I un- 
derstand such a woman well enough to feel sure she was 
happier drudging for him than she would have been 
with some smaller man drudging for her. All her let- 
ters, for the first twenty-five years of her married life, 
show that she rather gloried in overcoming her diffi- 
culties. I dare say she would have pitied some other 
woman doing the same things ; but we all leave out, in 
thinking of others, the personal affection which makes 
the things we do and suffer for those we love a pleas- 
ure." 

" My dear Mrs. Bishop," cried Mrs. Framley, laugh- 
ing, " I had no idea you could be so eloquent. I think, 
at one of our meetings, instead of a reading, we will 
have a lecture from Mrs. Bishop, entitled The labor 
that we love physics pain. You have n't convinced me, 
though, because my opinions are founded on principle, 
and the conviction that women ought, out of self-respect 
and for the sake of other women, to expect that a hus- 
band should sacrifice his tastes and pleasure, and con- 
sider it his duty to amuse and entertain his wife as much 
as she does him, and not consider his duty done if he 
provides for her and treats her as well as he would a 
favorite horse." 

" I can understand if people, man and wife, or brother 
and sister, begin to draw the line as to what is to be 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 147 

conceded and what expected, and what they do for those 
they love becomes a conscious self-abnegation, — that 
life under such circumstances may be looked upon as one 
of self-denial ; but I fancy few really are denying them- 
selves while pleasing a loved one." 

Mrs. Framley smiled. " You are the last person I 
should have thought romantic, but I see you are ; talk 
to me ten years from now, my dear, and I'll listen re- 
spectfully." 

Molly thought the matter over when she was alone. 
Was she really in danger of spoiling Harry ? She cer- 
tainly had known husbands who took all the comfort of 
their homes just as their right, and never seemed to 
think they need do anything toward the family pleasure 
beyond paying the bills. Molly was devoted to her hus- 
band ; but she was not so blinded by her love as not to 
see that Harry was in no way a perfect man. He was 
pleasure-loving only in the sense of seizing life's en- 
joyments, — even his generous impulses were part of 
them, — and he was too fastidious for a poor man ; and 
Molly could quite realize that he might not be a loving 
husband to some women just as good as she was, and 
yet she knew his faults were faults of temperament. 
How could he help it, if he liked brightness and gaiety 
and rather shirked the dreary side of life ? She sympa- 
thized so much with him that she had no dread of the 
future ; she had no wish to make him over to her stand- 
ard. (Herein lies the secret of half the " incompatibil- 
ity " in marriage, if Molly had but known it ; but she 
was not, consciously, a social philosopher.) 

" Well, I can't help it ; I don't believe Harry will be 
more spoiled by being made happy in his own way than 
if I try to make him make me happy in mine ; and if he 
does I can't help it. It all depends, I suppose, whether 
one loves a man well enough to enjoy his pleasure 
and find one's own in it ; and I can't help thinking Mrs. 
Carlyle was just as happy as those who pity her, until 
she got ill and morbid ; the sacrifices she seemed to 
make of her own comfort were not so, for her pleasure 
was in promoting that of her great husband." 



148 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

On the whole, Mrs. Framley's warning had done no 
good or harm. While boarding, although Molly had 
been as reserved as politeness permitted, and limited her 
intercourse with the ladies to formal acquaintance, it had 
been impossible for her to escape many such warnings, 
uttered good-naturedly, often by the way of joking a 
young wife ; but she knew then, as now, she could lay 
no deliberate plans to secure her husband's love and at- 
tention ; if she gave more than she received, she could 
not help it — she loved to give. " If it is really neces- 
sary to measure one's devotion in order to secure happy 
married life, then those women who love least have most 
chance of happiness ; but it cannot be." 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

A VERT PLAIN PUDDING — HOW TO COOK ODDS AND 
ENDS BILLS OF FARE FOR A WEEK. 

Molly's enlarged circle of acquaintances enabled her 
to ask aid for poor Mrs. Gibbs ; and several had sub- 
scribed small sums, which, put together, bought the poor 
soul fuel for a couple of months ; and others who re- 
gretted inability to give money — having so many calls 
already — gladly sent to Molly odds and ends of food, 
fag ends of steak, the tops of mutton chops, etc., 
which, long and softly stewed and left till cold, — when 
the fat came off in a cake which made nice dripping for 
Mrs. Gibbs to fry mush or potatoes in, — then stewed 
again with onions and potatoes at some times, vegetables 
and barley at others, made a very appetizing dish; thus 
with a very little of Molly's time and what would have 
been thrown away by one or two families, savory, nour- 
ishing food was provided for the destitute woman and 
children. Had the meat and vegetables been sent to 
Mrs. Gibbs herself, they would have done comparatively 
little good; they would have been fried, and the fat 
probably thrown away, and the tough meat eaten with- 
out relish. A large bread pudding, too, was made once 
a week ; and, as it cost so little and was so good, Mrs. 
Lennox asked Molly for the recipe : — 

Plain Bread Pudding. — Soak stale bread, crust 
and crumbs, in skimmed milk till soft ; press out the 
milk, and beat the bread fine ; add a table-spoonful 
of molasses, a tea-spoonful of ginger, and the third of 
a nutmeg to each quart of beaten bread ; sweeten to 
taste ; pare the yellow rind of an orange or lemon, or 
both, chop them fine, and add them with one or two cups 



150 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

of currants, according to the size of the pudding; put 
the whole into a pan, smooth it over the top, and strew 
it thickly with nice beef dripping or butter. Bake a 
three-quart pudding slowly four hours. Better cold than 
hot. 

This pudding, if care is taken with the flavoring, will 
by no means taste poor. It is especially nice cut in 
slices and fried, or — in hot weather — eaten cold with 
milk or cream and sugar. 

Mrs. Gibbs was getting now strong enough to do sew- 
ing, and one lady lent her a sewing-machine she was 
not using ; Molly felt there was now some hope of her 
getting work enough to partly support her family. 

Mrs. Lennox and Molly had often talked again over 
the advisability of the former getting help in her house, 
or not ; Molly was strongly of the opinion that, as her 
health was before everything, it certainly was advisable 
and truly economical, but she did not venture to urge it, 
because she knew everything would depend on the kind 
of girl they would get ; yet it seemed that any one with 
but two good qualities, willingness and strength, must 
be a great gain to a woman situated as her friend was. 

" I do dread green girls, they generally are so stupid." 

" I confess they often are ; so are those not green, 
only they conceal their stupidity better, and often add 
conceit to it ; but it seems to me what you are in urgent 
need of is a pair of strong arms ; if you get those, you 
can do without the brains, or supply them ; you never 
stop to ask if the woman you hire to wash and iron is 
stupid or not, she simply does the work set for her ; and 
if one pays a girl low wages, and she does just the work 
3^ou show her, like a machine, every day instead of two 
days a week, won't you be better off?" 

" Yes. When I think of the matter like that, I see 
I should, even if I have to follow her round for a month 
or so." 

*' Yes, you will be saving your muscles." 

" And I might then get time to think of my children's 
minds as well as their bodies ; my life is so sordid, T

never read a line ; and when Mr. Lennox reads to rae I 
am sorry to say I am too pre-occupied to listen. It is a 
frightful waste of life." 

She sighed, and on the last of these conversations 
said : " Mrs. Bishop, I 've resolved to try the experi- 
ment. I am not so afraid of the increased butcher bills 
since I have so many of your recipes." 

" I don't believe you need be; but you can easily get 
an idea of wliat you will spend. I think it a good plan 
to write out a sort of list every week ; it saves thinking 
each day what to have for dinner, and, of course, can be 
modified according to market prices. I limit myself to 
certain prices : and, if I find some articles dear one day, 
I can easily change ; for instance, cauliflowers have been 
wonderfully cheap this fall, and twice I have got a small 
one — large enough for us two — for 10 cents; to-day 
I meant to have fried cauliflower, and found a very small 
one was 20 cents ; of course I did not get it. You 
might draw up some sort of a list of provisions for a 
certain time, allowing for the extra person, and get a 
close idea of your probable expenses." 

" I wish you would help me." 

" I will, gladly." 

Later in the day, Mrs. Lennox came in much excited. 
'' My dear ! Mrs. Framley's chambermaid has a sister 
expected to arrive from Ireland this very week, and she 
is trying to get a place for her ; and I am tempted to try 
her. She is sixteen, and the sister says for the first 
three months she will let her live with nice people for 
very little." 

" I would by all means engage her if Mrs. Framley 
thinks well of the sister." 

" Yes. She says she is respectable and clean." 

"That 's about all one can hope for, and I think it is a 
fortunate chance." 

"I shall decide. Oh, think of my having another pair 
of working hands in my house: such a weight will be 
off my shoulders, and this saves me going to Castle 
Garden." 



152 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

Molly had decided to write her own bills of fare for 
the week, as it would save her thinking each day, and 
she could manage better, knowing beforehand all she 
would need. Accordingly, on the first of the month, she 
wrote out the following as her programme for the week's 
dining. The breakfasts so often came out of the dinner 
that she did not need to make special arrangement : - -

CHAPTER XXV. 

MARTA'S noodles BRAISED BEEF HOW TO ADAPT 

one's materials POLKA PUDDING AND SAUCE. 

I HAVE said before that Molly had repeated, as often 
as she could, the dishes she had first taught Marta, so 
that she might not get confused, and might know thor- 
oughly a few things. She hoped by this means to be 
able to depend upon her for certain dishes. At the be- 
ginning of this new month Marta seemed to have learned 
thoroughly how to make clear soup, white sauce, bread, 
and to fry ; and to Molly this did not seem a had result. 
In knowing how to make clear soup, she knew the prin- 
ciple of soup-making, and could make any other meat 
soup, — also in learning this she had learned what slow 
boiling really meant, and could therefore boil meat well. 
To make white sauce perfectly meant to do many other 
things of which that, or its modifications, are the founda- 
tion. Whether Marta's intelligence was quick enough 
to show her the value of the key she held, that good 
white sauce meant good bechamel sauce, good celery 
sauce, lobster sauce, poulette and all the long list of 
sauces with hiijh-soundino^ French names, that seem so 
hopelessly unattainable to ordinary cooks, as well as all 
kinds of white soups, and many sweet dishes, — that 
she would see and apply all this was a great deal too 
much to hope ; but if she would only keep her execution 
of what she could do up to the mark, Molly would feel 
that her efforts were far from wasted. 

" If she will only not be content with having accom- 
plished these things a few times, and will not become 
careless as she gets familiar, T must be very thankful ; " 
but this was just what IMolly did fear. The bread, al- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 155 

though light and good, was never twice alike, unless 
Molly superintended the making; which assured her that 
Marta had taken to " guessing " or, what was as bad, to 
measuring carelessly. Carefully she explained to her 
that a pint of flour did not mean all that could be taken up 
on a pint measure, or that a pint of water did not mean 
the larger half of a quart measure ; but the bread still 
came to table, sometimes coarse-grained, sometimes very 
close, showing it was sometimes made very wet, at others 
stiff, but always light and sweet so far ; but she feared 
this lack of exactness might run into other things. If 
so, it could not be helped. Molly knew that many 
very good cooks, who turned out excellent dishes, never 
measured, could never tell how they did it, or give an in- 
telligible recipe. Such cases had been often quoted to 
her as a reason why the precision of scientific cooking, 
as taught in cooking-schools, was nonsense ; but she knew 
that those who cooked thus, although they might produce 
excellent results four times out of five, the fifth time 
might make a failure ; they are always subject to good 
and bad "luck" with their cooking; and she knew, too, 
there are a certain few who are gifted with such a cor- 
rect eye for quantity that they could calculate the 
weight of a thing to a quarter of an ounce, — she herself 
had this gift to a certain extent, but she never trusted 
to it, — yet she understood that a cook with that excep- 
tional gift might do as well without weighing as with it; 
the only misfortune was that the generality were not so 
gifted, but believed themselves to be so, and the result 
is the frequent uncertainty with which one so often 
awaits the appearance of Dinah's or Delia's efforts, that 
result depending on their " good " or " bad luck." 

However, Molly was convinced that she had done her 
part with Marta, and that if she failed in the things she 
knew, it would not be because she did not thoroughly 
understand ; and she could now try to teach her sev- 
eral new dishes. 

The bill of fare for the day was noodle soup, braised 
beef, cabbage with white sauce, fried potatoes, and 
polka pudding. 



156 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

About a pint of clear soup was on hand, and Molly 
had many times intended to let Marta show her how to 
make the German noodles that had so pleased her when 
she first saw them ; but on days when clear soup was 
made or used, something had always called her attention ; 
and even to-day was ironing-day, but she helped Marta 
through with her work, so that there might be half an 
hour to spare without putting the ironing back, and 
then while Marta was finishing she prepared the des- 
sert. 

She had a recipe for polka pudding which she had 
often heard praised, and now, as she had the materials, 
would try. I say she had the materials ; but JNIoUy was 
very clever in '' cutting her coat according to the cloth." 
The recipe called for bitter almonds as well as sweet; 
she knew by flavoring a portion of the sweet almonds 
with the extract of bitter she would have the same ef- 
fect. Rose-water also was called for ; she poured a few 
drops of the extract of rose into a table-spoonful of 
water, and she had it, or at least the effect. 

The recipe was as follows : — 

Polka Pudding. — One pint of milk, boiling hot, 
two table-spoonfuls of corn starch mixed smooth in a 
little cold milk ; then pour the boiling milk on it and stir 
all the time ; thicken over the fire and mix, when cooked, 
with a table-spoonful of rose water, a table-spoonful and 
a half of thick cream ; or stir in one and a half of butter, 
one ounce of bitter almonds and one of sweet ones 
blanched, and beaten with a little white of egg to pre- 
vent oiling; beat the yolk and the rest of the white 
with another whole e^gg very light. Mix all together, let 
it come to the boiling-point, put it into an oiled mould, 
and set in ice. 

There were one or two peculiarities about this pud- 
ding ; it was unsweetened, except by the sauce, which 
might make it a pleasant change from sweeter dessert, 
and it was to be served ice cold on hot plates with hot 
sauce. 

The first thing was to blanch the almonds, which she 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 157 

did by putting them in a bowl and pouring water over 
them, which slie was careful to have quite boiliug ; when 
they had stood two minutes, she took them out of the 
water with a fork, laid them on a coarse cloth, and 
pressed tlieni between lier thumb and finger, when they 
slipped easily out of their skins. She dropped them as 
they were done into cold water to keep them white. 
When all were finished, she dried and weighed them 
(two ounces of almonds blanched being very different 
from the same weight in their skins), and then, as she 
had no mortar, she took the chopping-bowl, assured her- 
self it bore no odor or trace of herbs, and first chopped 
them fine ; then with the potato-masher, which she 
never used for its legitimate purpose, pounded them.^ 
One-half of these she flavored strongly with bitter almond 
and the rest of the recipe she followed exactly, using 
cream instead of butter, as she had it, having saved it 
from dessert the day before for this purpose. 

She measured the table-spoonfuls of corn starch very 
carefully, for nothing is more disagreeable than too 
much, and she boiled it in a saucepan set in another of 
water, so that the starch might be long cooked without 
burning. She removed it from the range to the table, 
and allowed it to go slightly off the boil before stirring 
in the eggs ; then returned it to the range and stirred till 
it came to the boiling-point again. 

When all was mixed, she poured it into an oiled 
mould and set it in the ice ; and then prepared to 
watch Marta, who was delighted with her accomplish- 
ment, and to see it so much appreciated. Her face 
fairly beamed as she found herself giving instead of 
taking instruction. She said very little, but Molly 
stood by and noted what she did. 

She beat one Qgg till it frothed, put to it a pinch of 
salt, and then worked in as much flour as it would take, 
about three table-spoonfuls ; she kneaded it till it was a 
smooth and firm, yet elastic, paste. This she rolled out 
on the pastry-board (very slightly flouring it) till it was 

1 An equal weight of almond paste may be used. 



158 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

as thin as writing-paper. So far, this was exactly the 
recipe for home-made veiraicelli noodles, which was fa- 
miliar to Molly. When the paste was as thin as she 
could get it on the board, Marta lifted the sheet of yel- 
low paste, laid a cloth folded on the board, and then tlie 
paste on that ; this enabled her to roll it still thinner ; 
then she removed the cloth and folded one -half the 
paste, and asked Molly for her thimble. Molly washed 
it and gave it to her, and Marta stamped a couple of 
dozen little disks out of the double paste. They were so 
closely stuck together that they looked like little circles 
of yellow card. Marta now took a little pint iron sauce- 
pan, put into it two large table-spoonfuls of lard, and set 
it to get smoking hot. While this was reaching the 
point of heat required, she took the little sheet of paste 
she had not used, and which was still single and had 
got very slightly dry, while the disks were being made, 
which she explained it was necessary for it to do. She 
then rolled up the thin sheet closely, and cut it at in- 
tervals of the third of an inch ; the paste now looked 
like so much yellow tape ; and these, she informed 
Molly, were either to be dried near the fire on a sieve 
and kept for soups, or to be boiled in water and dressed 
with butter. As she spoke, she tossed the shreds up 
lightly with a fork for some little time. The fat was 
now hot ; as hot, Molly remarked, as for croquettes, 
proved by the fact that the little disks when dropped 
into it (they became balls the minute they were in the 
fat) took a pale, golden, hue ; one-half minute colored 
them all alike ; they were then lifted out with a skim- 
mer, and Marta laid them on a clean cloth. Molly said 
nothing, because she did not want at this time to inter- 
fere with what was Marta's specialty, but in doing them 
herself would use paper to drain them instead of greas- 
ing a cloth. 

" I am ever so much obliged, Marta ; these are a real 
novelty. Now we will have the others boiled for 
luncheon and some day you can make them for dinner. 
Mr. Bishop is so fond of anything of the sort. I want 
to see you cook them." 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 159 

It was time for them to be cooked now, Marta de- 
clared, and she put on water to boil with a tea-spoonful 
of salt in it ; then she grated about a table-spoonful of 
cheese, and when the water was fast boiling dropped 
the " noodles " into it. She knew no other name than 
this for both the balls and the ribbons. They were to 
boil a quarter of an hour, she said, and every now and 
then she carefully stirred them up with a fork not so as 
to break them, but to keep them separate. She put a 
large table-spoonful of butter in a little saucepan and 
set it to get hot. When the noodles were strained off, the 
grated cheese was sprinkled over them with a little pep- 
per and salt, then the butter was put to get boiling hot, and 
immediately poured over them. They were again stirred 
up with the fork, and, when the butter was well through 
them, Marta pronounced them ready ; it was of course 
quite a small dish, but Molly told Marta if it proved 
half as good as it was pretty, she would be called on to 
make it very often. 

It did not belie its appearance. " Marta, this is quite 
a discovery ! I wonder if you can make any more Ger- 
man dainties ? " 

Marta smilingly said she knew only one or two really 
nice things. 

" Then you shall make them ; but don't you see, you 
silly girl, that when you knew how to fry those little 
balls you knew how to fry many other things ? " 

" I see it now, but I did not before. I thought every- 
thing else had to be done in a different way in a flat 
pan." 

" Well, when you make these ribbon noodles again, 
you will have to take the whole of the paste made from 
the egg, and double the butter dressing ; for I 'm sure 
Mr. Bishop will be delighted with them." 

In the afternoon, as the irons were on the stove, Molly 
put the beef in the oven and made what Soyer calls a 
" roast-braise." She took a small earthen crock or pan 
and put into it a large onion, a small carrot and turnip, 
two sprigs of parsley and a bay leaf ; on these she laid 



160 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

some fat pork shaved, and on that the meat beef neatly 
skewered and tied. Over this meat she put a thin layer 
of fat pork, and over all a cup of water and a flour and 
water paste, so that the steam could not escape. This 
was to be left in the oven, which was not allowed to get 
very hot for the first two and a half hours, — just hot 
enough to keep the roast simmering. 



CHAPTER XXVI. 

FRIED POTATOES POLKA SAUCE CLEARING- GRAVY 

OF FAT A VARIETY OF CAKES FROM ONE RECIPE. 

Molly had intended showing Marta how to fry po- 
tatoes, so as to have them crisp. If she gave directions 
merely, the girl would naturally think, being so much 
smaller than other things, they would be cooked as soon, 
and the result would be brown and flabby. She had 
waited to do this until some other dish needed her in the 
kitchen till the last minute before dinner, and to-day, as 
the sauce for the pudding had to be made, she could direct 
the one while she made the other, and she was anxious, 
too, to see to the taking up of the beef and making the 
gravy. She went to the kitchen in good time to attend 
to this. Half an hour before the meat was to come out, 
the oven was allowed to get very hot. When the paste 
was removed from the crock, the savory steam filled the 
air. The beef was lifted from the crock, put in the 
dripping-pan and set on the top shelf of the oven, now 
quite sharp, for half an hour, to brown, while Marta pre- 
pared the cabbage. The potatoes, peeled and cut into 
thin slices, had been lying in ice-water since morning. 
They were now drained and dried thoroughly, and the 
kettle of lard was put on the range to heat. Then Molly 
skimmed the fat from the gravy in the crock and poured 
it through a strainer into a small saucepan, and she 
then set Marta to rub as much of the vegetables through 
as possible. 

" Marta, you need not chop the cabbage to-night; for 
a change you will press all the water you possibly can 
from it, cut it across pie-fashion when it is in the dish, 
and make a gill of nice white sauce, using, remember^ 



162 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

half a table-spoonful of butter, half one of flour and a gill 
of milk." 

Molly was draining the cold water from the cabbage 
as she spoke, and put it into the boiling water ; then, as 
it was too soon to make the sauce, she went to arrange 
the dining-table — which was something she found quite 
impossible to teach Marta. 

When she returned Marta had rubbed the greater part 
of the vegetables through. Molly put a cup of boiling 
water into the crock, stirred it well round the sides, then 
poured it through the remains of the vegetables in the 
strainer into the saucepan, and then set it on the range 
to boil fast ; it was still thick with fat. 

" Marta, when that boils throw in a little cold water, 
then skim it; do that three or four times till it is quite 
clear of fat, then set it where it will boil rapidly, to get 
rid of the water you have thrown in. When the grease 
is entirely off it, you can stir in a dessert-spoonful of 
brown thickening." 

Molly needed for the polka sauce one table-spoonful 
of butter, well washed to remove salt, two large table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and a glass of wine, and 
the directions were as follows : 

" Beat sugar and butter till very light and white, make 
the sherry quite hot, add it gradually to the butter and su- 
gar, beating all the time, stand it in a saucepan of boiling 
water, and do not cease beating till all are at the boiling- 
point." 

Molly had to content herself with beating the sugar and 
butter to a very light cream and measuring the wine ; she 
must trust Marta to finish it while they were at dinner, 
as it was evidently a sauce that could not stand. 

When Marta had thickened the gravy for the meat, 
Molly seasoned it with pepper and salt, let it boil fast 
till very rich, then took it from the range and left it to 
stand for a few minutes. Marta had the soup on, and the 
noodles in the bottom of the tureen. 

" Now, Marta, try the fat, and put in the potatoes if it 
is as hot as for your noodles. You must leave them till 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 163 

the fat recovers the heat — it is of course chilled by the 
cold potatoes going into it. If you were frying for a 
large family you would only put in part at a time, but for 
our little dish you may safely put in all." 

In about one minute they were drawn away from the 
intense heat. 

" That is because they take at least eight minutes to 
cook. They will be tender before, but not crisp, and if 
they were kept in the hottest part they would be ^ark 
in color long before ten minutes. Understand, you must 
not put them where they will cook slowly, but where 
they will cook more slowly than right on the fire, and 
you can safely make your white sauce while they cook. 
As I am here I '11 take up the meat, but I want you to 
notice that the gravy has still a little fat which has 
formed on it like a skin, and can be lifted with a fork. 
One way of clearing very greasy stock or gravy is to 
boil it fast, let it stand, then remove the skin that forms, 
repeating this process several times if necessary. Where 
there is time, this is really the best way, for there is no 
need to watch it ; simply put it on the fire and remove 
it as you go about your other work. 

" Now those potatoes are done — lift them out with 
the skimmer, lay them on that brown paper I have put 
ready, sprinkle salt on them and then turn them into 
a dish. The beef is brown now — you can take it up, 
pour part of the gravy round it and put the rest in a 
sauceboat. Now I '11 leave the rest to you." 

The polka pudding Harry pronounced delicious, and 
exactly to his taste, but Molly thought she would have 
preferred it slightly sweetened ; but the combination of 
hot and cold, eccentric as it seemed, was very pleasant. 

Alter dinner Mrs. Lennox came in for a chat, as she 
occasionally did, leaving Mr. Lennox at home with the 
children. She wanted to tell Molly that she expected 
her new maid by the next Inman steamer. Her sister 
was going to meet her on its arrival and bring her right 
out. 

" Make up your mind to possess yourself in patience 



164 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

for the first few days," said Molly, " for you will no 
doubt need it, and then you may have real comfort." 

" Oh yes, I think I am patient. To-morrow I am go- 
ing to make a cake ; can you give me a good recipe ? 
Better than the one I have, I mean." 

" That depends on what it is. Do you want a cup 
cake ? " 

"Yes, the one I have is what they call feather cake, 
and very light and nice, but 1 would like a change, I 
confess. The recipe is one table-spoonful of butter, one 
cup of sugar, one cup and a half of flour, half a cup of 
milk, one quarter tea-spoonful of soda, half one of cream 
of tartar, two eggs and a pinch of salt. Then I stir but- 
ter, sugar and eggs together, beating them hard, then 
add flour in which the cream of tartar is mixed and milk 
by degrees, and I dissolve the soda in the least drop of 
boiling water, and bake it in a good steady oven. I use 
the same recipe for jelly cake." 

" I know that cake," said Molly ; " it is an old favorite, 
and for a quite plain one it is very good indeed, and for 
children or where it is quickly eaten up I should use it ; 
but I have to make a richer cup cake, using very much 
more butter or butter and lard, because for one thing I 
like a cake that is more like pound than sponge, and, for 
another, I want it to keep fresh. One loaf made with a 
cup and a half of flour lasts us a fortnight, and by using 
nearly half as much butter as flour it is better the last 
day than the first." 

" I thought so much butter would make it heavy." 
" No, if properly made you may use equal quantities 
of butter and flour as in pound cake, or half a pound of 
butter to one of flour as in queen cake ; but a cake with 
much butter needs more care in baking, and it takes 
longer than one with less — pound cake takes from two 
to tliree hours." 

" I am fond of pound cake, but I never aspire to make 
one." 

"It is easy enough to make, but not so easy to bake; 
While eggs and butter keep fairly cheap, I think I shall 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 165 

make one to keep, so that it will be always on hand, for 
the minute eggs and butter get more expensive I shall 
use as few as possible and make only fruit cake." 

" Why don't you get eggs now while they are cheap ? 
I get eggs from a farmer at twenty-two cents, but he tells 
me tliey will be twenty-five by the end of the month." 

" I pay that now at the store, but if I can get a few 
dozen at twenty-two cents, it will be an economy to take 
them. I will put them down in lime." 

" That is what I have wanted to do, but I tried once, 
and put ten dozen down when they were fifteen cents, 
and they did not keep at all." 

" We '11 do them together if you like ; but to return 
to the cake, I don't believe you can improve on feather 
cake for your purpose, but you can vary it ad infinitum. 
By leaving out a good table-spoonful flour and adding 
grated chocolate and flavoring with vanilla you have a 
very nice chocolate cake, or by stirring in it a cup of 
grated cocoanut or one of walnut meats it is delicious, or 
even by grating the peel of an orange and part of the 
juice, or lemon-peel. If you add fruit you need more 
butter, say two table-spoonfuls, or it will be crumbly and 
dry." 

" Thank you ; I never thought of chocolate cake. I 
shall try it to-morrow." 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

CANDIED LEMON-PEEL — TO WHIP CREAM SOLID — 

ICED CREAM COFFEE MADELEINE 

CAKE POTATO BALLS. 

The Dext day not being a very busy one for Marta, 
Molly proposed to candy the lemon-peels, that had been 
lying in brine until enough had been collected. There 
were now the peels of nearly a dozen. These were put 
on in cold water, and when they had boiled an hour this 
was thrown away and fresh cold water put on them, the 
object being simply to freshen them. When they began to 
get tender Molly tasted them to see if any salt remained 
in them, but she found them quite fresh ; had they not 
been, she would have changed the water once more. 
When they were tender enough to run a straw through 
them, which was when they had boiled nearly three 
hours, they were poured off, and a pint and a half of 
water and a pound and a half of sugar were put to boil 
to syrup, while Molly and Marta cut the peels into chips 
less than an inch long and a quarter inch wide. To ac- 
complish this quickly Molly told Marta to cut each half 
lemon-peel into three equal sizes, then to lay one on the 
other, and cut across all three ; the chips were about the 
right size thus cut. 

When the syrup boiled the chips were dropped in ; it 
was allowed to boil again, and to keep boiling slowly till 
the peels were clear, then more rapidly till there was so 
little liquid that they were in danger of burning ; then 
they were drawn to the back of the range for the re- 
maining syrup to dry away without burning. When 
they were at this point Molly sprinkled half a pound of 
sugar through them and spread them out on plates, tell- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 167 

ing Marta to put them in the oven with the door open, 
and let them remain all night to dry. 

She explained to Marta, if ever she tried to do them 
alone, to remember there must be always enough syrup 
to cover the peels at first, made in the proportion of a 
pound of sugar to a pint of water. 

Of course, although the process was a long one, the 
only attention required was to prevent the peels burning 
toward the last. 

Molly knew she would be in the kitchen a good deal 
this week, for she did not expect IMarta to be able to do 
much alone. The day on which she candied lemon-peels 
she planned to make iced cream coffee, a cake, and show 
Marta about the dinner. 

Mrs. Winfield's freezer was very small, the cylinder 
holding only a quart. Molly had not tried it hitherto, 
but home-made ices were so economical that she was 
anxious to become familiar with it. After breakfast a cup 
of black coffee was made by pouring half a pint of water 
through two table-spoonfuls of finely-ground coffee, in 
the same way as their usual breakfast coffee was made, 
only of double strength. To this was added a gill of thick 
cream and half a pint of boiled milk, and four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. This was poured into the cylinder 
and frozen. Molly had ordered half a pint of cream to 
be kept for her the day before, so that she would be sure 
of having it from twenty-four to thirty-six hours old, 
and the other gill was left in the ice till it was thoroughly 
chilled. Buying cream in such small quantity she could 
not afford to have the usual milky residuum, and knew 
the only way to whip it solid without one tea-spoonful of 
waste, was to have it at least twenty-four hours old, and 
thoroughly chilled, then to beat it steadily, without 
taking the beater out till it was as solid as the white of 
egg. This usually happens in ten minutes with a pint 
of cream, but if the kitchen is warm and it does not 
" come " in that time, it is often an economy of time to 
set it in the ice, just as it is, to get chilled again ; there is 
no occasion to remove the froth as it rises, — the whip 
will be finer and firmer without.

Marta made the Madeleine cake, while Molly stood 
by, recipe in hand. 

" This cake, Marta, has no milk, and therefore re- 
quires no baking-powder ; neither queen cake, sponge 
cake, pound cake, in fact none of the finer cakes have 
milk, and they are raised entirely with eggs. But 
several very good imitations of these cakes are made 
with baking-powder ; the saving is not great, and a cake 
made without chemicals keeps fresh much longer. 

" Madeleine Cake. — For Madeleine cake you must 
weigh four ounces of butter, half a pound of sugar, half 
a pound of flour twice sifted ; then grate the rind of half 
a lemon into the sugar, separate the yolks from the whites 
of three large or four small eggs, put two table-spoonfuls 
of wine in this cup, and, before you begin to make the 
cake, butter a small cake-pan. Now beat the whites of 
the eggs till you can turn the bowl without their slipping, 
cream the butter well, then beat the yolks of eggs into 
it, then add the sugar and wine ; beat well again, and 
then add flour and whites of eggs alternately, and when 
all is well mixed, pour it into the jDan, and bake it in a 
rather slow oven for an hour. 

" I am having only half the recipe made, so the cake is 
not very large ; hut we are such small cake-eaters that we 
get tired of a large one. Another time, if you make this 
cake, you may put rose-water or peach-water instead of the 
wine, and chopped candied lemon-peel instead of the grated 
peel. You see the batter is much thicker than for the cup 
cake you made, but if at any time you use flour that ab- 
sorbs more moisture, you must add another egg; this is, 
as it should be, as thick as pound-cake batter, — which 
means, as thick as can be stirred. It is more a paste than 
a batter. Will you remember that, when you have a 
recipe which says 'thick as pound-cake batter'? Any 
cake with baking-powder made as thick as this would be 
spoiled. It would be tough, with great holes here and 
there, so you must be very careful not to confuse the two 
rules, — moderately thick batter for plain cakes, with 
milk and baking-powder ; very thick batter for the richer 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 169 

ones, made without. Yet, of course, they must be stirred 
with a spoon ; if too stiff for that, your flour is very ab- 
sorbent, and you need another egg. Remember there is 
never any harm in adding an Qgg ; it will never spoil your 
cake as too much milk would do. 

" All cakes without baking-powder or its equivalents, 
soda and cream of tartar, require a much slower oven 
than those with them. A slow oven ruins a plain cake, a 
quick one spoils a rich cake, and you must be especially 
careful to turn it very gently, and, in taking this or any 
cake with much butter in it from the oven, to put it on 
the table very gently. I have known a cake to come 
from the oven perfect, yet, from being dropped hastily 
on the table, to collapse with a puff of steam issuing 
from it. The same thing may happen from taking it 
from the pan while quite hot, or from its not being quite 
cooked through ; cakes require to ' soak ' a few minutes 
even after a broom straw comes out clean. Lack of 
knowledge on these small points is one of the reasons 
why many people who make excellent plain cakes — 
by which I mean all the variety of cakes with baking- 
powder and little butter — do not succeed with richer 
ones, and why so many look upon pound cake as so very 
difficult, while it is really as easy as any other." 

Marta had twice succeeded admirably with the cup 
cake, which her unfortunate bang of the oven door had 
spoiled the first time. 

Instead of frying ihejilet de sole for dinner, Molly in- 
tended to have what is called by cooks turbans of sole, 
with bechamel. She put the bones and fins left from 
boning a flounder ( see directions, Chapter XIX.) into a 
pint of water, and let them stew slowly at the back of 
the range ; then she rolled up the filets and fastened 
each with a wooden toothpick, and set them to keep cool 
until she was ready to cook them. 

For the miroton of beef she cut from the braised beef 
of the night before some very delicate slices and laid 
them in an oval dish ; then she put a large table-spoonful 
of butter in a small saucepan, and let it get very hot, 



170 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

and poured into it a cup of rice, wbich had been boiled 
till just dry and tender, but not broken; this was fried, 
with frequent stirring, till pale brown, when it was 
poured over the beef, making a cover. The cold gravy, 
which was a solid jelly and rather too highly flavored for 
the purpose, was diluted with an equal quantity of hot 
water and a pinch of salt ; a tea-spoonful of brown thick- 
ening was stirred into it, and enough poured over the 
rice to moisten the whole, but not make it " sloppy ; " 
the dish was then put into the oven to remain for half 
an hour. 

Marta had put on the potatoes early, and when they 
were boiled she mashed them (keeping them quite hot) 
with a fork, beating it rapidly back and forth till they 
were white and light ; then Molly took them herself, 
and told her to strain the bones from the fish broth or 
stock, to put a salt-spoonful of salt in it. and set it to boil 
again ; than to chop some parsley very fine, to cut a thin 
slice of blood-red pickled beet, and cut from it with a 
thimble (in the absence of the proper tube) little disks 
the size of a dime. 

Molly seasoned the potatoes highly, putting to them 
(there was a scant pint) a dessert-spoonful of butter, salt, 
pepper, a grate of nutmeg, and a little parsley. Then 
she beat an ^gg and added part of it, keeping out only 
enough to brush over the balls when made. She formed 
each about the size of a small orange, and brushed them 
over with the %gg^. They were placed on a buttered tin 
and put in the oven to brown. 

The turbans of fish were now put in the boiling stock, 
and boiled till they were milky-white instead of clear — 
about eight minutes ; then Molly took them up with a 
skimmer, and in a small saucepan stirred a dessert-spoon- 
ful of butter and one of flour together, letting them bub- 
ble a few seconds, and then poured a gill of the fish stock 
and half one of milk to it, stirring all the time (in fact, 
making white sauce, but using part fish stock instead of 
all milk, which makes bechamel for fish ; made with 
veal or chicken stock it is bechamel for meat). When 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 171 

seasoned with a little pepper, the little rolled filets were 
placed standing up in a small dish, and the sauce poured 
all over them to mask them entirely ; then Molly took 
a little parsley on the end of a knife and carefully 
sprinkled it over the same, which, being thick, allowed 
it to rest upon it ; then a disk of the blood-red beet was 
laid deftly on the top of each turban, and a very pretty 
dish was the result. 

" Now, Marta, I leave you to bring the dinner in as 
soon as Mr. Bishop is ready. I have left the iced coffee 
packed ready ; all you have to do is to wipe every spot 
of ice and salt from the outside, and then fill two cups 
from it. Pile each cup very high with the whipped 
cream, and bring in the cake at the same time." 



CHAPTER XXVIIL 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN — LEMON HONEY — FRENCH 
ICING TO KEEP. 

The next day Molly, while showing Marta how to 
cook the dinner, added two other articles to those she 
liked to have always ready. Cake, as she said, was so 
little eaten by Harry and herself that a loaf lasted a 
week, even with Marta's help, for she, like most of her 
countrywomen, lived largely on soups, and salad, and 
vegetables, and cared little for sweets. She did not care 
to have the same cake, over and over again, and had she 
had preserves in the house, would have found it easy 
to convert it into something more attractive. Had she 
been keeping house long enough, jams and jellies would 
have been in her store-room ; peaches were now the 
only available fruit, and by the time Molly was settled 
enough to think of doing them up, they were both poor 
and dear, and in the boarding-house they had been rather 
surfeited with canned peaches, therefore she had let them 
go. She had lately been unearthing several old recipes 
of her mother's and grandmother's, and some of them 
she meant to try. There was one called "lemon honey." 
It was of more modern date than the others, and as her 
mother had written under it " nice change from preserves 
for cake," she decided to make it. She required for it 
half a pound of sugar, the rind and juice of a large fresh 
lemon, the yolks of three eggs and white of one, and 
three ounces of sweet butter. 

She followed directions, which were to put the butter 
and sugar together in a saucepan. (As the butter was 
rather salt she took the precaution of washing it first.) 
While these melted, she beat the eggs thoroughly, grated 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 173 

off the lemon peel into them, taking care to remove all 
the yellow, which contains the flavor of lemon, yet not to 
grate deeply enough to remove any of the white, pithy 
rind, and then mixed all together over the fire until as 
thick as honey, taking care it did not scorch. When 
done it was thick, smooth, yellow, and semi -opaque. 
She poured it into two small jelly-glasses, and put it 
away. 

While she was doing this, Marta had been picking 
over a scant half pint of black beans for soup, which 
when washed she put over the fire in a quart of cold 
water, in which she also put one small onion, two cloves, 
a tiny pinch of marjoram, one slightly larger of thyme, 
and two sprigs of parsley. These were to simmer slowly, 
until the beans could be rubbed through a strainer, and 
then a pint of strong beef stock, which had been making 
all morning, was to be added, and all boiled together for 
an hour. 

When the soup was on, Marta prepared a fowl as 
Molly had shown her, and when it was done she directed 
her how to cut it into neat joints for fricassee, without 
mangling it. While Marta was doing this Molly put a 
pound of sugar and a small cup of water into a small 
iron saucepan that she assured herself was beautifully 
clean, and set it over the fire. While the syrup came to 
the boiling-point she turned her attention to the fricas- 
see, and told Marta to lay the pieces in a saucepan with 
boiling water to just cover them, to cut an onion and 
half a medium carrot and put it to them, with a level 
tea-spoonful of salt and the sixth of one of pepper. 
These were to simmer very slowly until the fowl was 
tender, — about two hours, — then the fowl to be taken 
up, the gravy strained and put to boil very fast, till 
there was less than half a pint, while in another sauce- 
pan, half a pint of thick, white sauce was made (a good 
table-spoonful of butter and a full one of flour to half a 
pint of milk). This was added to the chicken gravy; 
they were stirred smooth together, and the chicken re- 
turned to it and allowed to simmer in it a few minutes. 



174 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

When Molly had seen the fricassee prepared and 
slowly stewing, she turned to the sugar, which was now 
boiling fast. She removed a little bluish scum, very 
carefully, not to stir the syrup. When it had boiled a 
quarter of an hour, she began to try it, dipping the fork 
into it, and when all the drops had run off, watching if 
a long thread remained. At first the drops ran off 
quickly, and she waited a minute before trying again, 
when she dipped in the fork. Drops came now slow 
and thick, and after the last one a short thick end re- 
mained, and she knew the point had nearly come. The 
next dip left a long, floating hair, and Molly took it from 
the fire and put it to get cool while she prepared the 
pudding, for which she used the following recipe : Two 
apples, finely chopped, two ounces of grated bread, two 
of sugar, two of currants, two eggs and the rind of a 
lemon, grated with just enough of the juice to give a 
perceptible acid, about a third of a pinch of salt, and 
the third of a small nutmeg, grated. Stir all together 
and pour into a small, buttered bowl that it will just fill. 

Molly followed the recipe, tied a cloth over the top 
(see directions for boiled puddings. Chapter XIV.) and 
put it into fast-boiling water to boil continually an hour 
and a half. 

Lemon sauce was prescribed for this pudding, but as 
she had used eggs freely lately and it required two, she 
substituted hard sauce. 

The boiled sugar was now about blood-warm, and a 
thin crust like ice had formed over it. This she was 
vexed to see, but she picked it off. Underneath, it was 
as thick as very thick molasses. She stirred it with a 
spoon, which was rather hard work, and in about five 
minutes it began to look milky ; this by continual beat- 
ing clianged to a texture like lard. Now she could use 
the spoon no longer, and worked it like dough in her 
hands. When it whs a compact, smooth mass she pressed 
it into a tumbler and covered it with oiled paper. 

Marta had been looking on with wondering eyes to 
see simple sugar change from a crystal-clear syrup to 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 175 

cream, and then to a paste, and now asked what it 
was for. 

"That is for icing cakes, and as it will keep just so 
for months, it is always ready. I should have called 
your attention to the boiling, only there was too much 
on hand, and there are such delicate degrees in boiling 
sugar that you would need your whole attention ; some 
time you may take sugar and experiment ; there can be 
no waste — unless you burn it, but that will not be 
likely — for it can be boiled over and over again. 
When it is perfectly boiled, that thin crust is not upon 
it, only a jelly-like skin ; but when it does form, if you 
find it is only on the surface, you can take it off and 
keep it to sv/eeten other things, but should it be grainy 
all through, you must put water to it again, and boil it 
back to the 'thread ' ; on the other hand, if you take it 
from the fire an instant too soon, you will find that, in- 
stead of forming a paste that you can handle, it will re- 
main thick cream. This would do for icing, as the cake 
absorbs some of the moisture, but it would not do to 
keep, nor could you add much flavoring or coloring, so 
it is always better to boil it to a higher degree. To- 
morrow I '11 show you how it is to be used. Now I 
think you understand the principle of frying well enough 
to make the potato croquettes if I read the recipe to 
you. This is it : Two cups of potato, mashed very 
smooth without milk, a dessert-spoonful of butter, salt to 
taste, a pinch of white pepper and a very little nutmeg 
(rub the nutmeg across the grater twice), and the yolk 
of an egg. Mix all together ; and for economy's sake I 
am going to use only the white of the egg for crumb- 
ing; beat it with two tea-spoonfuls of water. Make 
the potatoes into the shape of small pears, roll each in 
the white of Qgg-, then into cracker meal, and fry just as 
you do the other croquettes, in very hot fat. When they 
are done, stick the end of a sprig of parsley into the 
end of each one to simulate the stalk." 



CHAPTER XXIX. 

BOILED CUSTARD FROZEN BANANAS USES OF 

FRENCH ICING SCALLOPED POTATOES HOL- 

LANDAISE SAUCE ROAST OYSTERS 

UNEXPECTED VISITORS. 

For next day's dinner Molly bought a piece of cod 
about three inches thick, and a leg of mutton (the cod 
weighed three pounds, the mutton six and a half, which 
she directed the butcher to cut in half), and half a dozen 
bananas. 

As soon as she reached home she made a boiled cus- 
tard with two eggs and a pint of milk, in the following 
way : The eggs were whipped while the milk came near 
to the boiling-point. When that was reached, two heaped 
table-spoonfuls of sugar were added to the milk, and 
when dissolved it was poured to the eggs, stirring all the 
time. Both were then returned to the saucepan — which 
was set over the fire in a vessel or saucepan containing 
boiling water — and stirred. When the water in the under 
saucepan boiled round it, the custard was removed a few 
seconds, the stirring continuing all the time, and then it 
was returned. This was repeated till it was like thick 
cream. The object of removing it was this : The eggs 
must not boil or they will curdle ; they must be cooked 
or they will not thicken ; if left in the boiling water 
they would boil ; by removing every minute for a few 
seconds, you keep the custard at the boiling-point till it 
thickens, without running risk of its curdling. Fre- 
quently, in the fear of custard's curdling, it is taken off 
the fire just at the boiling-point, and it remains thin, 
unless corn-starch has been first boiled with the milk ; 
in the proportion of two eggs to the pint, corn-starch i*

not needed for moderately thick custards. When it was 
done it was set to get cold, and two bananas were cut 
into small pieces. While the cooking was going on, 
Molly got out the Madeleine cake, cut side slices from it 
the third of an inch thick, cut the dark crust off as thin 
as possible, and spread three of the slices with the lemon 
paste she had made yesterday The other three she" 
laid on these, sandwich-fashion. 

" Now, IMarta, I '11 show you what I am going to do 
with my fondant icing." As she spoke she put a table- 
spoonful of it in a cup which she set in boiling water 
over the fire. " You see I stir this, because, if I simply 
left it to melt, it would go back to clear syrup ; by stir- 
ring, it keeps opaque like cream. I do not let this get 
too hot, only just warm enough to run easily." When 
it had reached the point of being like double cream or 
molasses, she put the saucepan and cup on the table and 
added to it a few drops of vanilla and stirred it ; then 
with a tea-spoon she iced each slice, pouring the fondant 
on and spreading it, allowing it to run over the sides. 

*' You see this icing cools as you do it, and it may 
happen in cold weather that it will cool before you fin- 
ish (and if the candy has been boiled rather high, the 
same thing may happen any time) ; then you must dip 
a knife in boiling water, shake off the drops quickly and 
smooth with that; then you use the knife. Now if I had 
cochineal in the house I should have melted only half 
the quantity in this cup and half in another, and flavored 
one with rose, and added a very little coloring, — three 
or four drops, — and used it for half of these cakes ; but 
as it is, I leave them all white." 

Molly worked as she spoke ; the three slices were 
iced, then she held a sharp knife on the range till it was 
quite warm, wiped it, and cut the cake into neat tablets 
an inch wide and the width of the cake, — about two 
inches. Each slice made four, so she had a dozen small 
fancy cakes. 

" You can see, Marta, how easy it is, if your icing is 
always ready and you have preserves, to have a plate of 
12 



178 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

very pretty cakes in a few minutes. You may make a 
dozen and a half, or more ; then half a dozen may be 
white with lemon between ; half a dozen with red cur- 
rant jelly, and icing colored with a small piece of un- 
sweetened chocolate melted in a saucer on the stove and 
then stirred to the icing ; and the others with peach, and 
pink icing flavored very slightly with bitter almond ; and 
for very ornamental purposes, a dozen almonds, blanched 
and chopped to size of rice and sprinkled over the pink 
and white while the icing is still warm, make a very 
pretty change ; in fact, very many varieties can be made 
once you have got the idea, and remember never to 
mix flavors badly. Vanilla and chocolate always agree ; 
so you can use the same icing for the white and choco- 
late by doing the white cakes first, then putting the 
melted chocolate — and just a drop or two of water 
from the end of your finger or a spoon — to it. Choco- 
late stiffens so much that you are more likely than not 
to require a knife dipped in boiling water to spread it. 
"When all are done you may mix your pink and choco- 
late candy together, if the flavors agree (vanilla and 
chocolate and rose go exceedingly well, but almond or 
lemon not), work it together with hand or spoon, and 
the result will be a lovely ashes-of-roses color. You 
may put it away so flavored and colored for future use, 
or you may use it at once for other cake, which is better, 
as color fades if kept too long; but remember one thing: 
this icing, having been made hot, will be stiffer than when 
you began, and to be melted over again will need per- 
haps a dozen drops of water mixed with it; if it has 
become sugary and rough, you can't use it ; but if on tak- 
ing a pinch between your finger and thumb it will spread 
smoothly like putty or dough, it is as good as ever, which 
it is almost certain to be if you have worked quickly. 

" The only art in this French icing is to have every- 
thing ready before you begin coloring and flavoring, to 
have almonds, if you use them, blanched and chopped, 
— in short, have to leave off for nothing ; then you can 
^ork quickly, and the icing is not allowed to cool, and 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 179 

will not need relieating once or twice before you have 
finished. At first such quickness may not be easy, and 
if the icing chills, you will find it unmanageable ; all 
you have to do is to return it in the water to the fire, 
and melt as at first ; it will usually stand melting two or 
three times before getting grainy. Stir, while melting, 
only enough to mix the melted and unmelted together. 
Of course it is always easier to melt a quantity of icing 
in a bowl, and do a number of cakes, than a table-spoon- 
ful as I have done, because it holds the heat better, and 
you have abundance to work from ; but I don't want to 
destroy the delicacy of what I put away by melting all 
up. You see I have a little ball left." 

She had gathered the icing from the cups and spoon 
and worked it between her hands into a little shining 
ball, simply to show Marta what could be done if more 
had been left. " This is not worth putting away, but 
several little marbles like these if dipped into melted 
chocolate would make chocolate creams. You see how 
one thing leads to another in cooking." 

The custard was now cold, the bananas were stirred 
into it and they were put into the freezer, and ice and 
salt in the proportion of one third salt were packed 
round it. After it had stood a few minutes, Marta 
turned it for a quarter of an hour, when it was frozen. 

Just as Molly was about to begin to write directions 
for the scalloped potatoes, concluding she herself would 
need to make only the Hollandaise sauce, and could 
leave the dinner to Marta, a hack drove up to the door, 
and Molly saw Harry's mother and father in it. 

To say she did not tremble would not be correct ; for 
an instant her heart sank; if she had only known 
they were coming ! She wondered if everything was as 
nice as she would wish it in the little sitting-room. She 
generally had it, not trim, or oppressively tidy, but with 
only the pleasant disorder of a room that is lived in ; 
but Marta had a way sometimes of leaving her brush or 
dustpan — sometimes a kitchen cloth — where it ought 
not to be. Molly looked at herself, but she was neat, 



180 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

and no one had a right to expect a housewife at eleven 
in the morning to be ready for company- While Marta 
went to the door she removed her apron and washed 
her hands, and when she reentered the kitchen just 
waited to say : — 

" Marta, make some of your nice noodles at once ; 
leave your up stairs sweeping till later, and I '11 let you 
know what to get for lunch." She passed into the par- 
lor, having in the short interval recovered her composure, 
and welcomed her unexpected visitors as if their coming 
were a pleasant surprise, and not an embarrassment. 

"Will you come up-stairs and take off your things?" 
asked Molly, thankful that in consequence of her want- 
ing to show Marta how to make custard and use French 
icing, the sweeping was not begun and the whole place 
topsy-turvy and draped in sweeping-sheets. 

" Well, 1 don't know about staying ; we just thought 
we would run out and see what sort of a place you had 
here, and take the next train back." 

'• Oh, you would not do that ? " cried Molly, all her 
hospitable instincts revolting. " What would Harry 
say ? You must stay till he comes home, and he can 
perhaps induce you to stay all night." 

" Oh dear, no — no, thank you ; Mr. Bishop rarely 
stays anywhere from home at night." 

" No, no, my dear," echoed her father-in-law, " I am 
as old-fogyish as a bachelor, and I like to be at home." 

" Well, at least you must stay the day." 

*' Well, if we shall not put you out, we will remain 
an hour or two." 

" Come up-stairs, then ; you will rest better when 
your cloak is off." 

Molly had never felt as if her house was a bandbox 
till now. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop seemed literally to fill 
the parlor, yet they were not very large. Harry was 
much taller than his father, but they both had a pon- 
derous way with them. Mrs. Bishop's voice, too, was a 
deep contralto, which she used in a manner which, had 
it been affected, would have been haughty, but, natura] 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 181 

as it had become, yet seemed to impress people against 
their will with a sense of her importance. 

" And so this is your little cottage ? Do you find 
room in it ? " 

" Oh, yes," said Molly, smiling, " plenty ;" but as she 
followed her mother-in-law up the narrow stairs, which 
had never seemed so narrow till she saw the rich dress 
and velvet-clad shoulders fill the whole space, she could 
see how very tiny it might seem to one accustomed to 
large rooms and broad spaces. 

Mrs. Bishop glanced around the pretty bed-room. 

" And Harry and you really are contented here ? " 
she asked. 

" Indeed, we are more than contented ; I 'm as happy 
as the day is long." 

" Well, it 's very strange for Harry ; he was always 
the most fastidious boy ; but happiness is everything, I 
suppose." 

" We think so." 

Molly helped Mrs. Bishop off with her cloak, which 
was so handsome as to look strangely out of place in 
that simple cottage room, and then said, "If you will ex- 
cuse me, I will send you up some hot water and give 
orders for luncheon." 

" Thank you, thank you ; don't let me keep you ; and 
please don't make any preparation." 

" No, I will not ; 1 must only see that suflicient for 
three persons instead of one is on the table." 

She ran down-stairs, took Marta's rolling-pin out of 
her hand, told her to take a pitcher of water upstairs, 
and rolled the noodle-paste till she returned. 

" Marta, directly your noodles are made, go to Mrs. 
Framley's and ask her to please telephone to the fish- 
monger for a quarter of a hundred oysters in the deep 
shell, to be sent here for one o'clock. Be as quick as 
you can, and when you come back you will find on the 
dining-room table full written instructions for what you 
are to do." 

Molly went to the parlor and found Mr. Bishop read- 
ing his paper. 



182 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" Go on reading for a minute, please ; I will write a 
line. I know if you have not got through the morning 
news you will be glad to do it." 

" I just glanced at the money market at breakfast, 
and I 've too much respect for my eyes to read in the 
cars." 

Molly went to the davenport and wrote Marta's in- 
structions. Her first impulse had been to use her ma- 
terials for dinner, to have the frozen bananas for dessert ; 
but on second thought she resolved to give just what she 
meant to have for her own lunch, with oysters to make 
enough ; the bread was fresh and very good ; therefore 
she wrote the following : — 

" Make the cold bean soup boiling hot, boil one egg 
hard and cut it in quarters lengthwise, then across : lay 
it in the soup-tureen and pour the soup on it. Cut four 
thin slices of lemon and drop them in as it comes to 
table. When the oysters come, set them, in their shells, 
in a dripping-pan ; put on each a bit of butter, size of a 
hazel-nut ; pepper them and set them over the fire till 
the liquor in the shells bubbles ; watch till the butter 
melts, then they are done ; take them off the fire imme- 
diately. Use a cloth to put them on a hot dish ; take 
care you do not spill the gravy. Serve with hot plates. 

" Cut the cold pudding in finger-lengths, make a batter 
of two table-spoonfuls of flour, a pinch of salt, and milk 
to make it as thick as thick cream ; dip each piece into 
the batter, and fry in deep fat till brown ; sift sugar 
over it, and serve with hard sauce." 

As Molly wrote the last words she heard Mrs. Bishop 
coming down-stairs, and wondered much what she could 
do to entertain her. She had actually never been with 
her without Harry before, but the matter solved itself, 
for the elder lady questioned her as to her mode of life, 
what she did with her time, how Harry and she spent 
the evenings, and when told as simply as Molly knew 
how, she laughed, with a sort of good-natured sarcasm. 

" Quite idyllic, I declare ; so Harry reads aloud while 
you sew, — or else you both play chess."

" Yes ; of course we are almost strangers in Green- 
field. When we are better known no doubt we may go 
out more, but all our neighbors are very pleasant." 

" Now that is one thing I wanted to caution you 
about ; one of the penalties of living in a place like this 
is that you must know every one, and are apt to make 
intimates that you can not shake off easily when you go 
away." 

" But," said Molly, with some dignity, " I shall make 
no intimacies I should ever want to shake off; people 
good enough to be my friends now will be good enough 
at all times." 

" My dear, I think when I was your age I had just 
such ideas, but I found as I grew older I had to do as 
others do." 

The time did not pass very gayly, and Molly won- 
dered how she would get through the afternoon if they 
should stay, for she believed that she and her mother-in- 
law had nothing in common. 

When the time came, Molly excused herself and 
went in to help Marta lay the cloth. The silver and 
glass were always bright, so there was no hasty rubbing 
and polishing at the last minute. That morning Harry 
had brought in from the tiny flower-bed a handful of 
geranium and coleus, saying : " We have to take them 
as they are ready; frost may come at any time now." 

And they were now ready for the centre, arranged in 
a deep glass dish, the rich coleus round the edge, the 
geraniums in the middle. They gave the little table an 
air of brightness that nothing but flowers could have 
done. 

Molly did not want to be many minutes from the 
parlor, as she knew Mrs. Bishop would think great prep- 
arations were being made, and she would rather have 
given them bread and cheese than that, but she thought 
she would trust Marta to follow her written directions, 
as the only things, except the oysters, to cook were those 
she was very familiar with. The result justified her. 
It is true the soup had the eggs cut in slices instead of 
as directed, but that mattered little. 



184 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

When they were seated and Mr. Bishop, who was a 
gourmet if not a gourmand, exclaimed : " Capital soup ! 
capital! why don't we have it at home?" — Molly felt 
a good deal relieved and a little triumphant, for Mrs. 
Bishop was very proud of her cook. 

" Why, my dear George ! I did not know you cared 
for bean soup ! " 

" I don't, unless it's first rate." 

When soup was removed and Marta entered with the 
large dish of oysters, Molly gave one hasty glance, — 
would they be shriveled into leather, or flabby and half 
cooked ? But the error had been on the best side ; more 
than half were perfectly cooked, the others barely hot 
through. Poor Marta had followed instructions, but 
had not thought to turn the pan. However, Molly was 
only too thankful to have so little wrong, and helped the 
best to her visitors. They were still almost boiling in 
the shell ; and after this came a pretty dish of noodles 
that Marta had arranged round a mound of grated 
cheese. 

After the luncheon Mrs. Bishop said with a tone of ap- 
proval which Molly was determined not to think patron- 
izing, " I declare, Molly, you keep house very nicely." 

" You must have a remarkable good cook, by Jove! " 
broke in Mr. Bishop. 

" I am glad you think so," said Molly, smiling. 

" Where did yon get her ? " 

*' Castle Garden." 

Mrs. Bishop almost screamed when she heard it, and 
then Molly found the right conversational key was 
struck, for her mother-in-law had a great deal to say 
about her own troubles with servants, and the troubles 
of her friends ; and when the " hour of digestion " had 
passed, she asked if they would like to go out and see 
some of the beauties of Greenfield. 

" Well, that depends on what train we take.'* 

"I hoped you would stay and see Harry." 

Mrs. Bishop looked inquiringly at her husband, who 
said: 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 185 

" Oh, we must stay and see Harry, I suppose." 

Molly smiled inwardly, as she thought that his lun- 
cheon had reassured him as to his dinner. They all 
went out for an hour ; there was not much to see but 
some pretty, well-kept Queen Anne houses, and Mrs. 
Bishop let drop the remark that she had little expected 
ever to see a son of hers living in the second-rate neigh- 
borhood of a country town, which remark Molly pru- 
dently ignored. 

When they returned to the house, Mrs. Bishop, at 
Molly's suggestion, went to lie down, and her husband 
stretched himself on the sofa, and Molly slipped from 
the room, for she could see he too was drowsy. She 
went to the kitchen, told Marta how well she thought 
she had managed the lunch, and then gave directions for 
the dinner in writing, for she wanted to attend to her 
guests as much as possible. What she wrote was as 
follows : 

"At five o'clock, put the mutton in the oven as usual, 
and the fish into salt and water. At a quarter past, put 
white onions on to boil in boiling water ; and potatoes. 
When the potatoes are just done, cut them in slices 
thick ^s a dollar. Have ready a pint of white sauce, 
remembering to use two table-spoonfuls of flour and tivo 
of butter to the pint of milk. Chop a dessert-spoonful 
of parsley very fine, lay the potatoes in a dish, sprinkle 
a little parsley, pepper and salt among them, pour white 
sauce over them enough to moisten without makino^ 
them sloppy, and strew grated bread crumbs over all ; put 
them in the oven to brown. Keep the rest of the white 
sauce for the onions, which must be boiled very tender, 
poured dry immediately after they are done, and then put 
into the white sauce, and allowed to stew a few minutes. 

"As soon as you have the potatoes ready for the oven, 
put the fish, which you have nicely wiped, on a plate, 
lay that on a napkin and set both in a saucepan of boil- 
ing water, with two tea-spoonfuls of salt and two of vin- 
egar. It will take twenty minutes to boil." 

Molly had told Marta to take the peg out of the 



186 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

freezer and let off the water, at luncheon. She now 
went to see if the frozen banana custard was in good 
condition, and found it all right ; then she took out the 
paddle, worked the custard down from the sides, and 
covered it, packing in more salt and ice. 

" How glad I am we happened to have cold dessert," 
she thought; "it will save Marta so much at the last 
moment." 

She read over the written instructions, although there 
was nothing new but the manner of cooking the pota- 
toes, assured herself Marta understood everything, and 
told her she would come out herself and make the fish 
sauce. 

It was after four o'clock, and she laid the table just as 
she wanted it, went up-stairs and put on one of her pret- 
tiest dresses, and then returned to the parlor. Mrs. 
Bishop was just rousing as she passed her door, but did 
not descend for some few minutes, which Molly took to 
glance over the paper. 

All the time she was talking with his mother and 
father, Molly pictured Harry's surprise at finding them, 
and knew it would also be a pleasure. She did not 
know what to augur from this visit, whether it w^s sim- 
ply curiosity, or meant any return of the old parental 
tenderness for him; Harry would know, for he knew 
their ways better than she did. 

At last she heard his steps on the plank walk ; she 
flew to the door. 

" What 's up, little woman ? you look like an excla- 
mation point in person." 

The next moment he caught sight of his visitors. 

" Mother ! father ! why, this is a good surprise." 

Molly slipped out of the room while Harry was hear- 
ing all about their arrival, whipped on her apron and 
made the Hollandaise sauce. She put into a little iron 
saucepan a large table-spoonful of butter, a dessert-spoon- 
ful of flour, and let them cook one minute ; then she 
poured to them two thirds of half a pint of boiling water, 
stirred till smooth, then added, gradually, the yolks of 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 187 

three beaten eggs ; when she put the eggs in she stood 
the saucepan in another of boiling water, and stirred it 
well ; after the eggs had thickened she put two tea-spoon- 
fuls of lemon juice, salt, and as much cayenne as would 
go on the end of a penknife, and it was done. Marta 
had taken up the fish, and Molly directed the sauce to 
be poured entirely over it, herself seeing that there was 
not a drop of water from the fish in the dish. A sprig 
or two of parsley was laid at each end of the dish, and 
lemon in slices round it ; then casting her eye round to 
see that Marta had everything ready but the meat, she 
told her to bring the fish in when she should hear Mr. 
Bishop come down. 

The dinner was very nice, although, as Molly was 
glad to think, simpler than they often had when alone, 
and it was eaten without comment until the ice came on, 
when Mrs. Bishop expressed surprise at their getting 
such things in the country. 

"Oil, we can, I believe, get excellent ice-creams here, 
but this is home-made." 

" Indeed ! " 

After dinner Mr. Bishop declared they must catch the 
eight o'clock train. Harry urged them in vain to stay, 
and then it was decided that Molly and Harry would go 
to the depot with them. 

As they parted Mrs. Bishop said : " Harry, you and 
Molly must come home to spend Christmas, and had 
better spend a week with us." 

Harry promised to do so if they could. 

" Why, of course you can ; — why not ? " 

" Oh," laughed Harry, " we are family people now, 
with the responsibility of a house on our shoulders." 

" A house ! a match-box, you mean." 

With this shot they parted. Harry's real hesitation 
was doubt as to what Molly might feel inclined to do ; 
there was no denying she had been badly treated, 
snubbed and looked down upon. 

" Well, if this is n 't the strangest turn ; I don't think 
I ever knew my father to leave business for a day be- 
fore." 



188 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 

"What does it mean, Harry?" Molly asked anx- 
iously, for it had been a grief to her to feel she was the 
cause of estrangement. 

" It must mean that my father, or mother, or both, 
are beginning to see the}' 've been in fault." 

" Oh Harry, I should be so glad if you were once 
more all you used to be — to them." 

" I shall never be that, for I shall never go back to 
the sort of semi-dependence I was in, — but shall we 
go at Christmas?" 

" Oh, certainly." 

" I 'm afraid you may not have a very good time." 

" Oh, yes, I shall." 

" Then we accept. I tell you what, little Molly, if 
my father and mother liad not been favorably im- 
pressed, — had they found us living as they expected, 
they would not have said a word about our going 
there." 

" Oh Harry, I hope so ; surely, the less comfortable 
you were the more you would need them." 

" No, they look on it this way : as I made my bed so 
I must lie on it. Had the bed been a bad one, they 
would have said, 'serve him right;' as it seems much 
better than they thought it would be, they are inclined 
to think themselves wrong." 

Harry loved his parents, but he knew their pride, and 
that they would not have openly forgiven the blow to it; 
but he knew, small as the house was, Molly had shown 
them as refined a home as their own, and they saw that, 
after all, their daughter-in-law would grace any station 
Harry might ever attain to. 



CHAPTER XXX. 

HOMINY MUFFINS FISH BALLS ROYAL CUSTARD 

— " CONSOMxME X LA ROYALE " FRICASSEE 

SWEETBREADS VANILLA SOUFFLE. 

The next morning, bright and early, Molly came 
down-stairs. She was going to help get breakfast, as 
she always did whenever she had any dish new to 
Marta. Two or three times a week the breakfast came 
out of the dinner of the day before, and the stock she 
generally had on hand made such warmed-over dishes 
very different from the flavorless ones they too often 
are. For this reason alone she would have considered 
it cheap to buy a small soup-bone once a week, even if 
she had needed no soup, but every little drop — even half 
a gill — of soup that might be left was saved, and here 
Marta's German training came in. Whatever she lacked 
in other ways, she had none of the disdain of economy, 
confounding it with stinginess, so common with un- 
trained servants. Every bit of fat was put aside to try 
out once a week, every tea-spoonful of gravy or soup 
saved, and all bones put in one crock to be twice a week 
boiled down. 

When there was not likely to be much left from din- 
ner, Molly fell back on kidneys or ham and eggs for 
breakfast ; once a week there was always fish in some 
form. This morning there was a little mutton on the 
bone, just enough for mince or fritters; there was, also, 
quite a piece of fish. She had bought it with that cal- 
culation, so the mutton was left for another day. Harry 
did not like codfish balls of salt cod, but delighted in 
them from fresh, and, as once boiled, it would keep a 
week, she had intended to have them twice. Her visi- 



190 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

tors, however, had changed that programme, but she had 
more than enough for breakfast. As she herself was in 
the kitchen, too, she decided to make hominy muffins, 
there being a cup of cold hominy. 

As the frying fat would take half an hour to get hot 
enough, Marta had been told to put it on the range (cov- 
ered to keep in the fumes) soon after the fire should 
be lighted. Molly drew it forward that it might be 
ready by the time she herself was so. She set Marta to 
mash the hominy fine with a fork, then to add to one 
cup of it a cup of corn meal, half a cup of milk, and 
two tea-spoonfuls of melted butter, two tea-spoonfuls of 
sugar, one egg, and one tea-spoonful of baking-powder, 
and when beaten long and hard, to put it into gempans 
and bake fifteen minutes. 

While Marta was doing this, she herself flaked the 
cold fish quite fine and called Marta's attention to the 
fact that she used the remaining sauce to moisten it. 

" If I had not this sauce, I should make just enough 
stiff white sauce to moisten the whole ; but this is even 
better, and as there is egg in it I need use only one 
more." 

To a cup of flaked fish and sauce, of which there were 
two good table-spoonfuls, she put one beaten ego: ; this 
made it into a stiff batter or mush that would not run, 
but drop from a spoon. She seasoned it with pepper, a 
very little salt, and then dipping a table-spoon in flour, 
dropped large spoonfuls of it in the fat, which was hot 
enough for croquettes. In two minutes they were round 
and light as puff's, and beautifully brown. Knowing 
Marta might have to make them some time without 
having any sauce, Molly wrote the recipe and gave it to 
her. 

One cup of flaked fish, one table-spoonful of butter, 
one small one of flour, and one gill of milk ; melt butter 
and flour together, let them cook a few seconds, pour to 
them a gill of boiling milk, stir well over the fire till the 
mixture leaves the sides of the saucepan ; then it is done. 
Mix the fish with it, add two well-beaten eggs, and fry 
in spoonfuls in boiling lard.

Harry called these glorified fish balls. " In fact, 
Molly, they deserve some much more high - toned 
name." 

" Yes, but peopio who like the usual codfish balls, 
and they are the large majority, would not like these." 

" Another reason for not calling them fish balls, but I 
am one of the minority who do not like our Columbian 
dainty in its orthodox form ; but even minorities have 
tastes and some right to have them considered. "We '11 
dub these 'minority fish balls' if you will have no more 
fanciful name." (And " minority fish balls " they have 
become in that family.) 

For dinner there was to be clear soup with royal cus- 
tard, the stock for which had been made for bean soup, 
and only a pint used. Molly usually made two quarts 
at a time from a three-pound soup-bone, which served 
twice for soup and left a pint for gravies, sauce, etc. A 
pint and a half at each meal was ample, as neither 
Harry or herself took half a pint, and half usually 
found its way out to Marta, who straightway made it 
thick with bread and any vegetables there were ; she 
did not approve of straining it. 

To make a change, Molly intended to have in it royal 
custard, which would make it Consomme a la Royale. 

" Marta, we are coming to the end of our eggs. I 
must have extra ones. Mrs. Lennox's man comes to- 
day ; you run over and ask her to please send him to 
me." 

When Marta returned she told her to beat one Qgg^ 
then mix it with half a gill of the cold stock, and, as 
as there was no gill measure (something Molly had re- 
solved to get, but had forgotten, though she could have 
better done without the half-pint), and the quantity 
must be so exact, she measured half a pint of water, and 
divided it in four, put the fourth part in a glass and 
marked it, then threw out the water, and filled up to the 
mark with stock. It made about four tahle-spoonfuls. 
Molly looked about for something smaller than a cup, 
and found a little Liebig's " extract of meat " jar ; this 



192 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

she buttered. The beaten egg and half gill of soup, 
with a pinch of salt, were mixed and poured into it, 
then a piece of paper was tied over it, a small saucepan 
of water put over the fire, and when it was quite boiling 
the jar was placed in it. the water reaching to the height 
of the custard, but without danger of boiling into it. 
The saucepan was then drawn aside so that the water 
might only simmer ; if it should boil the custard would 
be spoilt. It was left for twelve minutes, and when 
taken out was quite firm. When cold the custard was 
cut into diamonds. 

" When you have the soup hot, to-night, throw these 
diamonds into it, Marta." 

" I don't suppose," thought Molly, " any one ever 
made •quite so small a quantity of savory custard be- 
fore, yet more would be waste ; we should not need 
it." 

At market she found a fine pair of sweetbreads, one 
of the dainties her butcher was not fashionable enough 
to charge a fancy price for, and indeed she found 
thirty cents a pair an outside price in Greenfield ; these 
were twenty-five, however, and had they been as small 
as they sometimes are, she would not have bought them; 
but they were large and white. 

As soon as they came they were put into salt and 
water and an hour later into boiling water, and parboiled 
for fifteen minutes, and cold water poured over them. 
All gristle and skin was now removed, and one cut into 
small pieces. 

An hour before dinner the remains of the fricasseed 
fowl were brought out. Less than half had been eaten. 
There remained a wing, part of the breast, a leg, and the 
back and side bones. Molly cut the drumstick off, laid 
it with the side bones for a grill for breakfast, — it 
would help out the minced mutton ; the rest, which were 
nice joints, she laid, covered with sauce as they were, in 
a plats, and told Marta to beat an egg, dip them in it, 
taking care every part was covered ; then to lay them 
in abundance of cracker crumbs, pat them geutly, and 
fry them just like breaded chops. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 193 

Meantime she had gathered the sauce from the 
chicken, whicli, by her direction, had been poured over 
it when the dish was changed, and put it into a small 
saucepan with a gill of stock, then the pieces of sweet- 
bread, and put tlie saucepan where it would simmer. 
She then cut circles from slices of stale bread, half an 
inch thick, each circle cut in half to form canapees ; she 
dipped each in milk, and then laid it in flour, covered it 
well with flour, and left it so. 

" Marta, when you fry the chicken, drop these pieces 
of bread in the pot. Be sure to shake oil all superfluous 
flour; handle them gently for fear of breaking, and let 
them fry pale brown. Be careful for the first minute 
after they are in ; they will sputter, as they are wet. 
Lav them round the sweetbreads when you take them 
up.'' 

Marta had already sliced some tomatoes ; these were 
laid in a dish, and bread crumbs, bits of butter, and 
pepper and salt sprinkled over each layer, on the top 
more crumbs and tiny bits of butter thickly strewed; 
then the dish was put to bake for half an hour. 

" Marta, a few minutes before taking up the sweet- 
breads, stir into the gravy a small tea-spoonful of white 
thickening. I see it will not be thick enough with the 
fricassee sauce. Now you have potatoes on, tomatoes 
in the oven, your frying-kettle back of the stove, soup 
ready to heat up five minutes before dinner, chicken 
ready crumbed, and I will make a vanilla souffle." 

Gouff'e's recipe for vanilla souffle was as follows, 
Molly using only a third of the original, which calls for 
a quart of milk : 

" One third of a quart of milk (not quite three gills), 
two table-spoonfuls of flour, two of sugar, a tea-spoonful 
of vanilla extract, a pinch of salt. Mix the flour with 
part of milk, set the rest to boil ; when it boils, mix both 
together as you would corn starch; if by chance it is not 
smooth, strain it, return to fire, stirring well. Take it 
off when it boils, put to it the yolks of two eggs, and 
beat very well ; then add the whites, beaten till you can 
13 



194 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

turn the dish over without their slipping. The whites 
must be stirred iu with greatest gentleness, — any quick 
stirring will cause them to liquefy and spoil your souffle ; 
when the whites are blended, bake in a buttered dish 
twenty minutes." 

Molly prepared it and told Marta to put it in the oven 
when she put the soup on to get hot, that they might 
have about finished dinner when it was done ; but it was 
better for them to wait for the souffle than the souffle 
for them, for waiting means spoiling it. Molly made 
some hard sauce, which she flavored with wine, and then 
left the dinner to Marta. 

When Harry came home his face showed he had 
something pleasant to say. 

"• Well, dear," he said as soon as he was ready for 
dinner, " you 've done it, and no mistake." 

"Done what?" She would have been alarmed if 
his face had not looked so very happy. 

" You 've captured my father." 

" Oh Harry, what do you mean ? " 

*' He came into my office to-day, and told me he 
had enjoyed himself out here very much, and he was 
good enough to add that his opinion of me had not 
changed in the least, that T had been as wrong-headed 
as possible, and that if I had chanced to pick up a pearl 
instead of a pebble, no thanks to my own wisdom. I 
could n't agree, and told him I knew all along you were 
a jewel, but he had the best of me, for he said . 

" ' Rubbish, sir ! You did n't know that she could 
boil an Q^g or sew a button on ; no boy in love ever 
asks that ! and you might have been a pretty miserable 
pair ! ' 

" And it 's quite true, Molly. If you could not have 
mended your own clothes, and I knew it, I should have 
married you just the same ; but I 'm glad to have a 
fortune in my wife, and so I told the dad." 

" Well, is that all he said ? " asked Molly, her cheeks 
flushed with pleasure, her eyes dancing. 

" Oh, dear, no, he did n't begin that way. He began 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH 195 

by asking me how I expected to meet my quarter's 
bills. I told him there would be none. At first he 
could not believe me, and I really believe he had come 
to give me a check to get us out of the need he thought 
we were likely to be in ; but when I told him all, and 
showed him your first month's accounts — stop a min- 
ute " (Molly made a dart forward to her desk) — "I ab- 
stracted that first month's figuring, my dear, and have it 
in my pocket, and it will remain there ; that is my prop- 
erty, my trophy. Well, when I showed that, and told 
him that I, with my little income, lived just as well as 
he did, he was conquered." 

" How does she do it? "he asked ; "and then I had 
to tell him that you put your time and thought to the 
little money and doubled its value." 

" Oh, Harry, how could you exaggerate so ? " But 
Molly's head was turned away and her eyes running 
over with happy tears. How well was she repaid for 
the work she had taken such pleasure in ! Every tone 
of her husband's voice revealed his pride in her, and 
his appreciation, veiled though it was by his gay, ban- 
tering manners, and she was grateful for the training 
that had made it all so easy to her. 



CHAPTER XXXI. 

A SURPRISE A BOILED DINNER DRESDEN PATTIES 

OYSTERS AND BROWN BUTTER "OLD ENG- 
LISH " FRITTERS. 

"When Molly returned from her walk to the depot 
with Harry, she found on the back stoop a barrel and a 
packing-case that had come by express. The barrel she 
quickly saw contained apples; the packing-case was as 
yet a mystery, but it did not long remain so. Molly was 
not frightened at a hammer, and between her and Marta 
the top was soon wrenched off; and then she saw it was 
full of treasures. A dozen pots of raspberry jam, the 
same of currant jelly, English pickled walnuts and 
French canned peas and mushrooms, and boned chicken 
enough to last her the winter, a jar of Canton ginger 
and one of French plums, met Molly's wondering eyes. 
What luxuries for a young housekeeper ! Of course 
they could come only from Harry's parents. 

Had they sent her a present for herself she would have 
resented it, considering how they had looked down ou 
her, but this gift she could take pleasure in, for it was as 
much for Harry as for her, and only such things as 
would be very pleasant and useful, but were not necessa- 
ries. Her housewifely mind was already reveling in the 
thought of a well stocked store-room. 

She had found a letter from Mrs. Welles, at the post- 
office, which she had waited to read till she could do so 
at home and enjoy it, for her friend was a clever and 
voluminous correspondent. 

" Next Monday, dear Molly, if convenient, I shall leave 
New York for Greenfield. Mr. Welles says you are 
doing a rash thing to invite me, that I am primed and

double-Ioarlerl and warranted to ^o off at any moment, 
for he lias lieard me the last month saying of every new 
thing ('tiling' always being 'dish' with me), 'Molly 
and I will do that together when I get there.' If you 
can, imagine how I ache to get away from this hotel and 
into a house of my own, with a kitchen and a range. 
Never, never again will I consent to be a homeless hotel 
waif. However, in two weeks our house will be our 
own again," etc., etc. 

Molly smiled over her friend's letter, she knew her so 
well. How pleasant it would be to have her in her owu 
house ! 

Charlotte Welles was an English woman five years 
older than Molly, who had known her long before her 
marriage to the rich banker, IMr. Welles. 

When Molly and her mother were living in London 
in very economical lodgings at South Kensington, they 
had become acquainted with Mrs. Morris and her hand- 
some daughter, whom at first they took to be an art-stu- 
dent at South Kensington. Charlotte had laughed mer- 
rily at the mistake. 

"No, indeed, I 'm a cooking-student." 
Then she had told Molly and her mother how it was 
that being certain she would have to earn her living, 
and, though generally clever, having no special talent for 
anything, she had chosen her career. "As for being 
a governess, I have neither patience nor meekness nor 
ability enough, and as cooking is just now coming to be 
a recognized profession for women who are not of the 
working-class, I decided on that. I don't find many 
ladies among the thorough-going students like myself, but 
I do see that no profession offers greater rewards to a 
lady, — perhaps for that very reason ; so I am qualify- 
ing myself to be a teacher." 

Molly's mother, invalid as she was, had taught her 
daughter more than most girls know of housekeeping, 
and her own taste leaned that way, but no doubt her 
acquaintance with Charlotte Morris confirmed it; she 
went with her sometimes to the demonstrations and

worked with her at home. When the latter left the 
school a medallist and went to Liverpool to lecture, 
Molly and her mother had gone to the south of France 
for the health of the latter, and there they heard of 
Charlotte's success, how her grace and culture (and per- 
haps her beauty) made her much in request at ladies' 
colleges and schools, and of the public lectures she gave. 
But her career was cut short, before it was well beo-un, 
by her engagement to an American banker of wealth, — 
an engagement speedily followed by marriage ; and it 
was through Mrs. Welles that, after her mother's death, 
on returning to her native country, Molly found the po- 
sition as governess she had held up to her marriage with 
Harry Bishop. Several months before Molly came to 
Greenfield Mr. and Mrs. Welles had let their house and 
gone to England for a trip, but returned two months be- 
fore the tenant's term was up and had been living at 
one of the best hotels since. 

True to her old instincts, Mrs. Welles attended all the 
best cooking-lectures in whatever city she might be, and 
after Molly's marriage they had gone together to cook- 
ing-school and practiced at her house, which had been 
of incalculable service to Molly. Since her return to 
America they had not met. It is needless to say she 
looked forward to her visit with heartfelt pleasure, for 
she felt that to her acquaintance she owed very much. 

And how these good things had come just in time ! 

To-day they were to have a regular boiled dinner, 
German soup made from the half leg of mutton boiled, 
and an egg beaten in it, the same that she had shown 
Mrs. Lennox how to make, and the mutton with caper 
sauce, mashed turnips and moulded potatoes, macaroni 
cheese, and pudding. 

This dinner Marta could cook with written instruc- 
tions, all but the pudding, and Molly, now she had jam, 
meant this to be an old-fashioned English jam roly-poly. 

The written instructions were as follows : 

At five o'clock put the half leg of mutton into boiling 
W^ater, only enough to cover it ; put with it one carrot 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 199 

cut, one turnip, one onion, and when it has boiled very 
slowly half an hour, put in a very scant tea-spoonful of 
salt. Put some macaroni to boil. Put the turnips, cut 
into strips, on the fire in boiling water at half-past five, 
also the potatoes. Let the turnips boil fast, the pota- 
toes slowly. 

Make three gills of white sauce instead of half a 
pint, never forgetting when you increase the milk also 
to increase butter and flour in same proportion ; then 
when the macaroni is tender put a layer of it in a small 
dish, pour over it a table-spoonful of white sauce and 
the same of grated cheese with pepper and salt, then 
another layer of macaroni, more white sauce, cheese and 
seasoning, and over all strew bread crumbs and bits of 
butter, and bake till brown. 

The turnips strain when tender and let them stew five 
minutes in some of the white sauce made for the maca- 
roni, reserving the rest for caper sauce. To make it, 
add capers in proportion of one good tea-spoonful of ca- 
pers to the half pint, and just as it goes to table stir in 
a tea-spoonful of caper vinegar ; if it stands after this it 
will be apt to curdle. 

Take up the mutton, put it to keep hot, skim and 
strain the broth and let it boil down fast till there is 
enough for dinner and no more ; beat an ^g^,-, mix a 
very little of the broth with it, and put both into the 
tureen, with a tea-spoonful of parsley chopped fine. 
Let the broth remain off the fire one minute, then pour 
it to the ^gg^ stirring quickly, then serve it. 

Molly had a busy morning arranging her store-room, 
and making a list of what it contained. This list she 
nuiled behind the door, with a pencil attached, so that 
when anything was used a mark was made against it. 
In this way, when any -article was nearly out she would 
be reminded to replace it. It was not so necessary, per- 
haps, with a girl as careful as Marta, or in her small 
family as in a larger one, but it had been her mother's 
way, and she followed it. She could then keep track of 
everything at a glance. 



200 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

One hour and a half before dinner Molly put on a 
saucepan of water to boil, and then chopped six ounces 
of beef -kidney suet very fine, which she mixed with 
half a pound of flour and a pinch of salt. She made a 
hole in the centre of the mixture, and poured in enough 
cold water to make a stiff firm paste (not so stiff as to 
be hard to roll out) ; it was handled as little as possible, 
only worked enough to keep it together. It was rolled 
out once to a sheet half an inch thick, then spread with 
raspberry jam, which was not allowed to come within an 
inch of the edge all round ; the edge was wetted, the 
paste rolled up and the ends pinched closely to prevent 
the jam coming out, as was also the flap along the centre. 
A pudding-cloth was scalded and floured, the roly-poly 
laid on one side of it and rolled up ; eac^i end was tied 
close to the paste, and the centre pinned. No string was 
passed round the centre, as Molly had sometimes seen 
done, for as the pudding swells the string cuts into it. 
When finished the cloth was not very loose on the pud- 
ding, nor tight, but what may be called an easy fit. 
AVhen it would leave the water, after an hour and 
quarter constant boiling, it would be swelled and plump. 

Molly saw that the water boiled fast when it was 
dropped in, and that there was plenty of it. 

" Marta, take care that the pudding never ceases to 
boil, and once in a while look that it floats round, so 
that it may not stick to the bottom." 

The next day Molly had to make Dresden patties, 
and some fritters the recipe for which she had unearthed 
from the old last-century book ; it was written in the 
quaint language and indefinite fashion common to cook- 
ing-books of that date. Molly had often thought, in 
reading them, that housekeepers' wits must have been 
much more brilliant in those days, or the books could 
have done little good. 

But she had thought out the matter, and her knowl- 
edge of old cook-books told her that a " handful *' proba- 
bly meant a man's hand full, as the book was written by 
a man cook ; that when you were told to " beat and 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 201 

search your sugar " it was because they had not latter- 
day improvements and probably no powdered sugar was 
sold. Reduced to present-day terms and small di- 
mensions, the recipe was as follows : 

The yolks of two eggs and a tea-spoonful of flour, and 
a scant half pint of milk or cream, a pinch of salt, a 
quarter of a small nutmeg and a table-spoonful of sugar. 
The flour and yolks of eggs to be well beaten with a 
little of the milk, the rest to be added warm, and all 
beaten very well together with the sugar and salt and 
nutmeg. This will make a custard, to be baked in a 
shallow round dish till firm, then put to get cold. Make 
a batter of a gill of milk (half cream, the recipe called 
for), one whole egg and enough flour to make it thick 
enough to quite mask the back of a spoon without run- 
ning off, — two level table-spoonfuls are about enough ; 
beat one of the whites of eggs left from the custard till 
it will not slip from the dish ; put to the batter, which 
must be quite smooth, the grated rind of half a lemon, 
a pinch of salt, and then add the beaten white of egg, 
stirring very slowly after this is in. Cut the custard 
into six pieces, pie-fashion, and dip each piece into the 
batter, and drop it into boiling lard. 

The recipe sounded very well to Molly, and her mind 
went over all sorts of improvements in flavoring, from 
simply adding vanilla to the introduction of chopped 
citron or crumbled macaroons into the custard ; but she 
would make the recipe as given, or as nearly as she 
could interpret it, first. 

Although the fritters would be much better hot, per- 
haps, the book gave no clew to that ; she knew they must 
be good warmed over, or even cold, and as she did not 
want to leave the dinner-table to attend to the frying, — 
being an experiment, — she felt she must do it herself. 
She decided to cook them at once ; the custard required 
very careful handling while it was being dipped in the 
batter, and she found the safest plan to prevent break- 
ing was to pour the batter into a saucer, and take up 
the fritter, when dipped, on a broad knife. The batter 



202 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

completely hid the custard, and when dropped intg> tlie 
fat, which was very hot, it puffed up outside and doubled 
the size. 

They took two minutes to get pale brown, and then 
they were laid on paper to drain ; and after the sugar 
was sifted on them they certainly were pretty to look at, 
and at dinner were found to bear out their good appear- 
ance, and Molly added them to her special recipes. 

The Dresden patties she wanted Marta to understand 
making, because they were so easy, so useful, and so 
pretty. With a view to making them, Molly had kept 
half a stale loaf that was as light as baker's bread, — too 
light, she thought, for the table ; from it she cut two 
slices two inches thick and from them she cut, with a 
medium sized biscuit-cutter, three rounds ; the cutter was 
simply a circle of tin with a handle over it, so that the 
cutter went right through the bread ; had it had a top to 
prevent it going through, she would have cut them with 
a half-pound baking-powder box. On the top of each 
round of bread she cut a smaller circle as for pastry 
patties; now she beat an egg, added half a pint of milk 
with a pinch of salt, and stood the three patties in it, 
telling Marta to let them stay so at least an hour, turn- 
ing them about, but being careful not to break them, 
the idea being to let the egg and milk soak well into 
them, and to make them as moist as possible without 
breaking. It will be remembered that one sweetbread 
only was cooked two days ago ; the other was now cut 
into dice, two tea-spoonfuls of flour and butter and a gill 
of stock made into bechamel sauce, and the sweetbreads 
put to it with a table-spoonful of oyster liquor (as she 
happened to have it). This thinned the sauce suflfi- 
ciently to let the sweetbreads cook in it without burn- 
ing. By the time they were done the sauce would be 
reduced again and very thick (or, if it should not be, the 
sweetbreads would be taken out, and the sauce boiled 
fast and stirred till very thick). 

Marta had the lard ready, very hot indeed, when 
Molly came out to show her how to fry the patties. She 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 203 

put- tkem to drain, using a cake-turner, for they would 
not bear handling. 

" At some times these are rolled in flour, at others in 
Qgg and crumbs, and I think they are prettier for crumb- 
ing ; but it is not necessary, and I will save an egg. 
Now I am going to drop them into the fat, which is as 
hot as it can be without burning. Stand aside, for it 
will splutter very much." Each one was dropped from 
the end of the cake-turner, and, as Molly said, they 
" spluttered." 

" I leave them on the very hottest part of the fire, 
because they are filled with cold custard, which will keep 
the temperature about right for five minutes ; then draw 
them a little aside if they are brown, and let them re- 
main two minutes." When taken up they were a bright 
brown, looking almost like a doughnut that had been 
shaped like a small Charlotte Russe. The centre was 
then scooped out, leaving about half an inch of crust all 
round, which was filled with the fricasseed sweetbreads 
piled in the centre. 

" The beauty of these patties is that they can be made 
early and heated in the oven, and that they are suitable 
for dessert with preserves, or are excellent filled with 
any kind of rich minced meat or oysters." 

Molly had long wanted to make an experiment with 
oysters ; she believed simply panned and served with 
brown butter they would be delicious. She had never 
heard of " oysters au beurre noir,"" but, knowing they 
must be good, resolved to try the experiment. She 
waited, however, till Harry was in the house, for they 
would spoil by standing. 

She made the sauce first, because the oysters must not 
wait. She put a good table-spoonful of butter into a 
little saucepan and watched it till it got golden brown, 
but did not burn ; then she put it aside to cool a little, 
and heated a tea-spoonful of vinegar in a cup, Marta 
meantime draining the oysters. They were put in a 
stewpan with pepper and salt, covered tightly and set 
over the fire and tossed round once or twice, the heated 



204 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

(but 7iot boiled) vinegar was put to the brown butter, 
they were made very hot together, and when the oysters 
were plumped in their own steam, they were drained off 
and turned into a hot dish, with the brown butter over 
them, and served at once. They were such a success 
that this became a favorite oyster dish with the Bishop 
family.

Molly bad not been specially economizing tbis last 
week, aud bad bad some little extra expenses. Sbe was 
rejoiced to see tbat, even so, sbe bad a margin. Ot" 
course, towards tbe end of October would come an in- 
crease in tbe price of butter and eggs. Tbis sbe pro- 
posed to avoid to some extent by ordering at once a pail 
of fine October butter at twenty-five cents, wbicb would 
last for cooking tbrougb tbe winter, even if it sbould 
not continue sweet enougb for sucb fastidious butter- 
eaters as berself and Harry to use at table. Of eggs, 
too, sbe bad ordered a gross from a farmer at twenty- 
five cents. Tbis would give one dozen a week for 
cooking tbrougb tbe twelve weeks wben tbey were dear- 
est, and witliin tbis dozen for cooking sbe meant to 
keep ; as soon as tbey sbould be dearer, sbe would 
make fewer tbings tbat required eggs, and avoid tbeir 
use wbenever sbe could do witbout tbem. And, so far 
as sbe could, she would supply berself witb every tbing 
tbat would keep during winter and grow dearer as the 
months passed ; but as tbe margin sbe now bad reas- 
sured her against any little accidental expenses, she 
might safely reckon it would not grow less, unless she 
knowingly increased her expenditure for any purpose, 
and she would have always a little reserve to meet con- 
tingencies witbout touching anything outside the ten 
dollars a week. 

On Monday of the second week in October, Mrs. 
Welles was to arrive. Molly did not lay herself out in 
great preparations for her, for she knew her friend would 
be happiest in being allowed to help her, and do exactly 
as if she were in her own home. Sbe knew she could 
give her no greater pleasure than by so ordering her 
table as to be as different as possible from anything that 
money alone could buy; and simple, old-fashioned dishes, 
tbat no hotel would supply in perfection, sbe would 
have during her stay. She did want to arrange, bow- 
ever, so that she need not even think of luncheon for a 
day or two, and would have something in the bouse. 
Happily, in doing this, she could gratify Mrs. Welles's 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 207 

English taste, for she would make one of the veal and 
ham pies so dear to English palates, so rarely to be 
found in perfection out of England. Molly had been 
taught by Mrs. Welles herself to make them. 

On Saturday, Molly had ordered two pounds of breast 
of veal and a pound of very fine ham, cut thin ; she 
would not need much of it, but the rest would be nice 
for breakfast. The breast of veal was cut up into pieces 
two inches long and about an inch wide, and put on in 
boiling water to simmer very gently one hour, the bones 
with it. The water being just enough to cover the 
meat, no salt was added, for the meat should retain its 
juices. When done, the meat was removed from the 
broth, the bones left in it, and all gristly parts and 
bones that could not easily be removed when raw cut 
from it and thrown back into the saucepan ; the meat 
was then put aside, and a salt-spoonful of salt, a quarter 
one of pepper, and half a bay leaf, with a small pinch of 
thyme, one of savory, and two sprigs of parsley, were 
put to the broth and bones, and it was left to cook 
gently two hours longer ; then it was allowed to reduce 
to half a pint by boiling faster with the cover off, then 
strained and put away. Molly, at the same time, made 
some rough puff paste (see recipe. Chapter VI.), and 
left it on the ice till Monday. 

This morning, therefore, she had nothing to do but 
put the pie together, which she did in the following 
way: 

The ham she cut in very thin strips, using about a 
quarter of a pound. These she poured cold water upon, 
and put where they would come slowly to the boiling- 
point. Had she had any cold boiled ham, she would 
have used it in preference ; but she could remove any 
strong taste by this parboiling. While it was doing, 
she made forcemeat balls thus : 

Half a cup of fine bread crumbs, a tea-spoonful of 
finely chopped parsley, the eighth of a tea-spoonful each 
of powdered thyme and marjoram, one squeeze of lemon 
juice ; flavor with nutmeg by just rubbing it once across 



208 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

the grater, a suspicion of lemon peel, a scant salt-spoon- 
ful of salt, a quarter one of pepper. Chop into this a 
good table-spoonful of butter (or finely chopped suet, she 
would sometimes have used) ; the whole made into a 
stiff paste, with an egg well beaten with a table-spoon- 
ful of water. It did not take all the egg ; about a table- 
spoonful was left, which Molly reserved to glaze the 
pie. In making the forcemeat into paste, she was care- 
ful to handle lightly, not to squeeze or knead it, and 
when it was well mixed she sprinkled flour on her 
hands, took a tea-spoonful of forcemeat, and made it 
into a ball. She used the remainder in the same way. 

Then she took a deep oval dish, and put at the bottom 
a layer of the ham, then one of veal, and four forcemeat 
balls (one at each corner), a little salt and pepper, and a 
few more bits of ham, another layer of veal, and half a 
dozen forcemeat balls. The dish was now full. She 
piled more meat and a little ham towards the centre 
till it was dome-shaped, and then filled every crevice 
with the strong jelly formed from the meat and bones. 

Now she rolled out the paste, and cut a long strip the 
third of an inch thick and an inch wide. She wetted 
the lip of the dish, laid the paste round, and pressed it 
close on the inner side, so that the gravy could not boil 
up under it. Then she moistened the upper surface, 
laid the sheet of paste over the pie, and with both hands 
gently pressed the paste into the groove formed between 
the dome shape of the meat and the dish ; then, with a 
sharp knife, she cut off the overlapping paste, so as not 
to drag it in the least ; and then, with the back of her 
forefinger, laid on the top of the border, pressed the up- 
per and under paste gently, hut closely, together, but was 
very careful to leave the edges untouched. 

She cut a hole in the centre to let out steam, rolled a 
piece of paste very thin, cut from it four diamonds two 
inches long from point to point, laid the four, with the 
points to the centre, round the hole ; and, rolling another 
bit of paste as thin as paper, dusted it with flour, folded 
it up several times, then turned the four corners of the 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 209 

little many-folded square to form a little ball as large 
as an olive, and cut a cross deeply, and witli a sharp 
knife, across the top; then turned back the corners as if 
she were opening a pond-lily bud ; and there was a 
rough imitation of a flower. This she inserted in the 
hole in the pie, which it was large enough to cover, 
without closing up too much for the steam to get out. 
With a feather she now brushed the pie over with the 
yolk of an egg^ not leaving a spot untouched, except the 
edge, which was not glazed. Molly explained to Marta, 
who asked the reason for the omission as she passed on 
her way to the boiler, for she was washing. 

" If I washed the edgeswith egg, the paste could not 
rise so well ; for the leaves would be glued together, as 
it were. This is the rule in all use of pastry : Leave the 
edges quite untouched ; do not even smooth them with 
your finger. Smoothing them and pressing them with 
your thumb, which I have told you not to do, is the rea- 
son why your pies, even if I make the paste, are never 
as handsome as mine. You smooth the life out of the 
paste and squeeze all the air from between the leaves 
which one is at such trouble to make ; and it is the air 
that causes the flakes." 

Molly put the pie in the oven, which was about the 
right heat for bread, — that is to say, she could count 
twenty-five while her hand was held in it. In an hour, 
it was pale brown all over. It was taken out of the 
oven, and left a few minutes on the table till the con- 
tents had ceased to boil ; and then what remained of the 
jelly was warmed, the pastry " rose" was lifted gently 
from the centre, a funnel inserted in the hole, and the 
jelly, warmed, was poured carefully through it into the 
pie. Molly watched, while pouring slowly, that the last 
disappeared before adding more, for fear the pie miglit 
overflow ; then the " rose " was replaced. 

This pie is good hot, but in England is always eaten 
cold, and cold she knew Mrs. Welles would prefer it. 
The great thing to be desired in these cold pies is plenty 
of savory jelly in between the meat, and very light 
crust. 



210 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

While the pie was baking, Molly had set the pastry 
back on the ice, while she made the filling for some 
cheese cakes. 

Properly they should be made of sweet curd, dried 
and crumbled, hence the name. But Molly had eaten 
excellent ones in which ground rice, boiled to thick 
mush, was the foundation ; others in which bread 
crumbs were substituted, the object being to get a body 
of some plain material other than flour, with which the 
rich ones could be incorporated ; but her own favorite 
way was to use rolled cracker. She put two heaped 
table-spoonfuls in a bowl, and three table-spoonfuls of 
sugar. She beat two table-spoonfuls of butter, from 
which the salt had been washed, till it creamed, added 
the yolks of two eggs, and the juice of half a lemon, 
and the peel of one, grated. Then she blanched and 
chopped fine as possible two table-spoonfuls of almonds, 
and added to them a few drops of bitter almond ; then 
all were put together, and a large table-spoonful of wine 
was added. 

Molly tasted to see if the bitter almond was pleasantly 
perceptible, and then rolled out the paste and lined patty- 
pans with it, taking care to press only the centre to 
make it adhere, not the edges ; then a large tea-spoonful 
was put into each (the patty-pans were small), and they 
were put in the oven and baked a beautiful pale brown. 
They needed watching closely, as the filling would easily 
burn. 

The dinner was to be a homely English one, which 
would not necessitate her being in the kitchen at all 
after her friend arrived, as it would consist of ; — 

Clear Soup. 

Beefsteak Pudding. 

Stewed Onions. Fried Potatoes. 

Trifle. 

The soup, for which the stock was made on Saturday, 
could be left to Marta ; also the vegetables. The pud- 
ding required three hours' constant boiling, and there- 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 211 

fore could be made and be cooking before Charlotte ar- 
rived. The trifle, also, could be ready. 

She had bought in the morning half a dozen small 
sponge cakes and a dozen macaroons. She now made 
some very thick custard with the yolks of two eggs, a 
small tea-spoonful of corn starch and half a pint of milk, 
and sugar to taste. 

The milk was put on to boil, the corn starch mixed 
with a very little of it, cold, and stirred into the hot 
milk. Both were boiled together five minutes ; then it 
was allowed to cool very little, and the beaten yolks 
and sugar added. The ol3Ject of boiling the corn starch 
is to cook it, as, after the eggs are in, the custard must 
not boil, but only be kept at boiling-point till they 
thicken. (See directions for boiling custard, Chapter 
XXIX.) 

When the custard was made, it was flavored with al- 
mond, set to cool, and Molly laid the sponge cakes in a 
glass dish, about two inches deep. She poured a glass 
of wine over them, moistening them thoroughly, and 
sprinkled them with sugar thickly.. Over this she 
spread a layer of raspberry jam half an inch thick ; then 
the macaroons were laid over it. Then she poured the 
cold custard on it. While it had been getting cold, she 
whipped half a pint of cream, sweetened and flavored 
with vanilla. This was now piled high over the cus- 
tard, and it was put in the ice-box to get very cold. At 
the last it was to be decorated with little knobs of red 
currant jelly and blanched almonds cut in strips. 

Now there was the pudding to make. She was get- 
ting all done early, because she was going to meet Mrs. 
Welles ; but the pudding would not be injured by stand- 
ing half an hour before it went into the water, which it 
should do at three o'clock. 

She had a pound and a half of very fine, juicy round 
steak. This she cut into pieces an inch or so square, 
rejecting all gristle and skin, but using a very little of 
the fat. This meat she seasoned highly with pepper 
and salt, stirring it up among the pieces. Then she

made a suet crust (see recipe, Chapter XIII.) and 
greased very well a quart bowl. When the crust was 
rolled to an even half inch thick, she laid the sheet in 
the bowl, pressing it gently all round. Into this she 
put the meat, and, when the bowl was full, poured in 
a half cup of water ; then she gathered up the overlap- 
ping paste, and pinched it togetlier to form a cover, leav- 
ing no cracks through which the gravy could get out. 
A floured cloth was now put over the pudding, and a 
string passed twice round the flaring parts and tied se- 
curely. The four ends of the cloth were brought over 
the top and tied. The pudding could be lifted by these 
knotted ends as if it were a basket or bundle. 

Marta had now done washing and cleared up, and was 
able to attend to Molly's directions. 

" Marta, I shall see this pudding in the pot before I 
go to the train, and watch it come to the boiling-point 
quickly again ; but you must remember it must never 
cease boiling, or it will be heavy. When you go to take 
it up, remove the cloth and string ; then run a thin 
knife round close to the bowl, and turn it out gently 
on a hot dish, trying not to break the pudding in doing 

SO. 

Molly had the water on in a pot, that it might be 
ready boiling by three ; and, although she had warned 
Marta to keep it boiling, she did not mean to trust en- 
tirely to her for it, but would come herself to look at it 
every half hour or so. 

Early in the morning the eggs had come, and Molly 
had waiting ready a keg half filled with lime-water, 
made by dissolving one pound of quicklime in a gallon 
of water, allowed to stand all day and then poured clear 
from the sediment. The sediment was rather more than 
the mere sprinkling it should have been, and she feared 
it might be too strong, and added more water and again 
let it settle, when it nearly all dissolved ; the rule being 
to put in as much lime as will just dissolve, leaving only 
sediment enough to show that this point is reached. 
She then very carefully put in the eggs, washing every

soiled one, and warned Marta never to stir them, and, 
when taking them out, to be very careful, as one broken 
or cracked would spoil the whole ; if this occurs, fresh 
lime-water must be used. 



CHAPTER XXXIII. 

TOWN VERSUS COUNTRY THE SERVANT QUESTIONo 

It was with a heart full of happy content that Molly 
started to meet Mrs. Welles, and when the train slowed 
into the depot, she saw a well-known head, with bright 
chestnut hair, leaning out of the window. 

The next moment they were exchanging greetings 
like two gay school-girls, for they were both warm- 
hearted, impetuous women, and apt to be rather regard- 
less of bystanders and appearances. 

*' Dear girl, you look so well," said her friend, holding 
her off a minute to look at her. " I see Harry is not 
killing you with kindness, as I used to predict he would.'* 

'' And you, too, look well, notwithstanding the hotel 
life you abhor so. Where is your trunk ? " 

** I had it expressed to your house from the hotel. 
It saves all bother, and I knew you and I would enjoy 
the walk home together, as you are so near the station." 

And enjoy it they did, as only women who have 
known each other in girlhood and made plans and 
dreamed dreams together can. The village street was 
as prosy as any other Jersey village ; but to these two, 
who recalled London days, as they went through it, it 
was poetical enough ; and as they left the little stores 
and faced the country in all its autumn glory of color, 
and the sweet fall odors of ripening fruit met them, 
Mrs. Welles drew a deep breath. 

*' How lovely this is ! No wonder you look well. 
What a waste it is, after all, to live in the city ! " 

" There is something to say on both sides, Harry 
thinks. We gain all that nature gives in the country, 
but we lose art and many things that brighten one's wits. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. ■ 215 

But people who have a very narrow income can enjoy 
very few of the advantages of city life, even if they live 
in it ; so, for them, the country is undoubted gain." 

Wlien they reached the house, Mrs. Welles was de- 
lighted with it and everything about it, and made Molly 
tell her all about her housekeeping and how she man- 
aged. When she had given her a sketch of her daily 
life, Mrs. Welles said, thoughtfully : 

"That is all very nice, Molly; but it seems to me 
you must have a good deal to do, or else your Marta is 
a treasure." 

" Well, I have a good deal to do, and Marta is in one 
sense a treasure, though, at -the same time, I can see that 
many people would not get along with her. Her good 
qualities seem to be cleanliness (although she is not 
tidy), and an ambition to be a good cook; but for gen- 
eral work she needs constant watching and telling. 
Still, annoying as that is, I do not know that one can 
expect more in a girl like her than willingness to do the 
work laid out for her. If I were paying for trained 
service, I should be dissatisfied ; but there are few 
trained girls who will undertake general work." 

" That seems to me a matter of course. A girl who 
is anxious to rise is one who will try to learn how to do 
it, and it would be hard if one expected her to remain 
always in an inferior position. If we do that, I think 
we remove the strongest incentive to good work — the 
ambition to better herself. I think it is the general 
lack of such ambition among girls, the non-recognition 
of it as one of the conditions of service by ladies, that 
makes the great difference between our P^nglish ser- 
vants and those here." 

" I am sure you are right," said Molly ; *' and that 
seems to me the true solution of the servant difficulty. 
Young girls must learn that high wages and lighter work 
are to be attained by proficiency ; that they can look on 
first places, where low wages on)y ought to be expected, 
as apprenticeships, and every succeeding one to be a 
step higher toward the comfortable and well-paid po- 



216 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

sition an accomplished servant of any branch ought to 
be able to command. But this is something that de- 
pends on the ladies themselves. So long as they pay 
the competent and incompetent nearly jdike, and do not 
insist on testimonials, not only as to respectability and 
temper, but iwojiciency in duties undertaken, there is 
not much encouragement to an ambitious girl, or at 
least she sees she can get along without making special 
effort, and that, if she does make it, she will meet with 
the discouraging fact that she is in competition with 
those who have made no effort." 

" Still, one would think that is a thing that would cure 
itself. Every one would rather pay competent servants 
than incompetent." 

" Of course, if they know it. But when two girls 
come well recommended, how can you or I tell which is 
the really competent one, if, as if often the case, a good- 
natured lady has taken her servant's good qualities, her 
amiability and willingness, more into account than the 
efficient discharge of her duties ? I have kept my eyes 
wide open on this subject, and find that a neat-looking, 
willing girl will nearly always keep a place, even if not 
competent for its duties, and be well recommended when 
she leaves ; not, as justice demands, recommended for 
the qualities she actually has, but also for general com- 
petence." 

Mrs. Welles looked slyly at Molly. 

*' And what character would you give Marta ? " 

" Now, that is hardly fair. I see the evil. I don't 
say I can do anything to remedy it ; that has to be a 
general movement. When I am in Rome, I suppose I 
should do as the Romans do ; yet I would try to be very 
specific. But it would do no good. If Marta leaves 
me and applies for a place as first-class cook she will get 
it. Some few ladies will need some more corroboration 
than her word and my letter, testifying to general good 
conduct ; but many will readily take her, and she will 
stay a month or two, if not longer, get large wages 
enough to make it as profitable to wait for another well 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 217 

paid place if she does not readily find it. A girl recona- 
mended as clean and willing will get a place as cook if 
she has the hardihood to assert her ability ; yet who 
would employ a carpenter simply for his amiability?" 

" Then you would have apprenticeship among ser- 
vants as among artisans ? " 

" Of course, if it could be, I would ; in other countries 
there is practical apprenticeship without bonds, that en= 
sures, to the painstaking employer who does her best for 
a girl, not losing her the moment she has learnt the first 
rudiments of housework, and her apprentice year would 
be at low wages ; she would have the option of ad- 
vancing her year by year, oi' of letting her go and tak- 
ing a fresh ' prentice ' hand." 

" I pity the woman." 

" So do I, yet it is just what we all do more or less 
without any distinct benefit. Of course no reasonable 
person would expect a girl to remain at the low wages 
when she became worth more." 

" That 's just what I was thinking, Molly. You will 
make Marta worth a good deal more than $10 a month 
as wages go." 

"I know it, but I shall be content to give her $12 
when she she can do my work with only superintendence 
on my part, and later on I shall expect her to ask me 
$14; and I shall have to decide to give it, or take 
some one else ; yet, if she does her best till then I shall 
not feel ill used, things being as they. are. We can't 
expect a young woman like Marta to be better than her 
times." 

" Still, this comes back to the same point ; you have a 
good deal to do." 

" Yes, but what better employment can I have ? We 
live about as comfortably as if we kept two servants, 
because I do much of the lighter work ; I have no drudg- 
ery. Marta does that. I have very few social duties. I 
have plenty of time to read and do my little sewing and we 
live as I like to live ; I should not be so happy any other 
way. When I have children I shall have less time, but 



218 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

I expect Marta will be able to go on pretty well with an 
hour of my time in the kitchen." 

" But suppose IMarta wants to leave ? " 

" I don't think she will. She seems to have the Eu- 
ropean horror of changing and, I think, believes herself 
part of the family. If 1 am mistaken I shall be unfortu- 
nate, but my altering my policy now would not change 
matters. I made up my mind to expect very little be- 
yond hand work from one servant ; that I have got." 

They chatted till Harry came home, Mrs. Welles un- 
able to make up her mind whether Molly's ideas were 
wise or foolish ; as ideas they were good, of course, but 
how would they work in practice? Mrs. Welles was* 
too English to understand why a woman should make up 
her mind to put up with half service, and she had been 
too well off since she had been married to have learnt by 
experience. 



CHAPTER XXXIV. 

ox -TAIL SOUP GRISINI — STEWED LAMB AND 

PEAS MERINGUES WITH CREAM. 

Mrs. "Welles's trunk arrived the next morning and 
Molly found her friend had come as she said, " prepared 
and loaded for a kitchen campaign." Several little things 
not easily obtained in a country town she had brought, 
and last of all she handed out a paper package. 

" There, Molly, I tiiought, perhaps, you had none, and 
I have two or three recipes needing the stuff, so I made 
sure and brought it with me." 

Molly had meanwhile cut the strings and saw in the 
paper a thick roll of something wrapped in waxed paper. 

"Ah, almond paste! I wished when I was chopping 
almonds the other day that I had some." 

The almond paste was a substance that>Jooked, in 
color and appearance, like very heavy bread ; it was 
almonds ground by machinery, and saved infinite time 
in preparing almonds for macaroons, cake, etc. 

" There, Mistress Molly, you see we are going to make 
goodies while I am here." 

" I shall be glad to do my part and sit at your . feet 
again." 

" Nonsense, Molly, I have nothing to teach you. You 
were too intelligent not to see, when you had the key to 
a few things, that the rest was a matter of experiment 
and practice ; but while I was in London I had some rec- 
ipes given to me, vaguely written, as amateur recipes 
usually are, but I want to try to get them right." 

Molly, mindful of her guest's English tastes, had asked 
her butcher to save her two ox-tails, as they were very 
cheap things, and she prepared them for soup while Mrs. 
Welles finished her unpacking. 



220 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

First, she cut up the tails into joints and each joint of 
the root of it into three, then put them on the fire, in 
cold water, let it come to the boiling-point, drained 
them off and pumped cold water on them. This was the 
process called " blanching," so often directed in cooking- 
books without further explanation. They were then 
dried in a cloth, dusted with flour, put in a pot with a 
table-spoonful of butter, and fried a bright brown and 
frequently stirred round, to color them evenly ; then she 
cut up a carrot, a turnip, and an onion, and put them 
into it, then added a bay leaf, three sprigs of parsley, 
half a salt-spoonful of thyme and marjoram, two cloves, 
a tea-spoonful and a half of salt, and half a salt-spoonful 
of pepper and two quarts of water. This was to simmer 
four hours ; at the end of the second hour a few of the 
nicest joints of the tail were taken out to serve in the 
soup, the others left to boil down with it. Half an hour 
before dinner the soup was strained and a table-spoonful 
of brown thickening (recipe in Chapter XIII.) stirred 
into it to make it the consistency of very thin cream. 
As it boiled down it would grow thicker ; then it was put 
to boil fast, without a cover, and every few minutes 
skimmed. When quite clear of fat, the joints of the tail 
were put in, a glass of wine added,^ and the soup was 
ready to serve. 

Mr. and Mrs. Bishop's turn was near to receive the 
reading-club, and Molly had thought it would be pleasant 
to have it the week Charlotte was with her. The lady 
entertaining could, of course, invite any of her friends, 
and Molly asked Mr. and Mrs. Lennox. Mrs. Welles 
was delighted to help, and the afternoon was given to a 
discussion of what should be provided. 

" We are wiselj^ limited as to what is to constitute 
the refreshment. There must be no oysters or ice cream, 
only cakes and sandwiches and coffee and tea, or choco- 
late." 

" No bouillon ? " 

" Yes, that has been admitted in place of one of the

other beverages, as so macy can't take coffee or tea at 
night." 

" Let 's say coffee and bouillon, then, and sandwiches. 
Are you limited to one kind ? " 

" No. Mrs. Framiey, last week, had tongue, cheese 
and chicken." 

" Well, have chicken and lobster then. How many 
guests shall you expect ? " 

"About thirty-four." 

I suppose it is not necessary to go further into figures 
at this day to show that Molly was likely to do all she 
had undertaken to do on her allowance of ten dollars a 
week, but as her evening was a great success and cost 
very little, I will give the details to show how it was 
done and what the actual cost was. The flavorings 
formed part of Molly's stores and the almond paste was 
given to her, yet I add the price here, for those who 
may wish to go and do likewise may not be so fortu- 
nate. Although the list of articles were ordered, they 
were not all used. 



One dozen eggs 

One lobster, 3 pounds .

Bread , . . .20 

$2.87 

The first thing was to make four loaves of nice bread ; 
this Molly did, using two quarts of water and one cake 
of yeast (see recipe for bread. Chapter XV.). To save 
trouble of cutting, Mrs. Welles suggested pipe bread 
[grisini) to eat with the houillon, and before the bread 
was put to rise a piece was broken from the dough of 
the size of a large orange ; to this was added the white 
of an egg, whipped a little, a tea-spoonful of powdered 



222 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

sugar and a good tea-spoonful of butter softened. When 
it was all well incorporated, flour, warmed and sifted, 
was added to bring it to the consistency of stiffish bread- 
dough. It was kneaded long and well and set to rise. 
It took longer than the bread, because it was a little 
stiffer and also the bread and additional flour weakened 
the yeast. When it had swelled well, however, Mrs. 
Welles and Molly sat down together to roll it, while 
Marta attended to the dinner, which was to consist of 
soup, stewed lamb and peas, stuffed potatoes and me- 
ringues, with whipped cream. 

The meringues had been made in the morning and the 
cream whipped. The stewed lamb was something so 
simple that it could be left to Marta, although in leaving 
any stewing or boiling to Marta, now or any other time, 
Molly never omitted an occasional glance to see that it 
neither left off simmering and that the simmering had 
not become boiling. 

" The rolling out of grisini is a very tedious task," 
said Mrs. Welles, " but the compensation is that they 
keep as well as crackers, once made." 

"You will have to direct me, Charlotte, as I have 
never made these before." 

" All you have to do is to roll a small piece of dough 
under your hands on the board, so, till it is no thicker 
than a pencil. If the dough is too soft — it should be 
stiffer than bread-dough, yet quite elastic — you can add 
a very little flour." As she spoke she laid her two 
hands over a bit of dough as large as a hickory nut and 
began rolling, pressing pretty hard as she rolled. 

" If they do not roll smooth, wet your palm with milk 
slightly." " 

Molly followed directions. As each pipe was made it 
was laid on a baking-pan. They were irregular io 
length, but generally about nine or ten inches long. 

It took them half an hour to roll them, for it was diffi- 
cult at first for Molly to get hers of fairly even thick- 
ness all the way down, but practice brought facility. 
The dough made about three dozen, and they were put 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 223 

in a. warm place to swell till as thick as a medium-sized 
cigar. Then they were to be baked in a cool oven half 
an hour. They were to be very lightly colored, when 
done, about like pilot biscuits, and should snap short; 
hence the slow oven, as they must dry as well as cook. 

The bread had not been set till early in the morning, 
so that it might bake late in the day, for Molly's recep- 
tion was to be on Friday — this was Wednesday — and 
she wanted the bread to be as near as possible two days 
old, for sandwiches, yet not at ail stale. The bouillon 
and cakes would be made Thursday, and there would be 
nothing but the sandwiches to cut and coffee to make on 
the day itself. Molly was anxious to get all done before 
that, so as to be quite fresh for her friends. 

Before leaving the kitchen she went over the recipes 
she had written for Marta's guidance, emphasizing all 
important points. For the stewed lamb there were some 
lean chops from under the shoulder (see Chapter III.) ; 
these were floured and laid in a stewpan with a little but- 
ter and fried brown, an onion cut up and apiece of carrot 
(half a small one), and enough hot water barely to 
cover them was poured on them with half a tea-spoon- 
ful of salt. They were to stew very slowly for two 
hours, then taken up and kept hot while the gravy was 
skimmed and allowed to boil down to half a pint, a large 
teaspoonful of brown thickening was put into it and a 
can of peas, and seasoned to taste, then the meat was re- 
turned and allowed to stew very gently a quarter of an 
hour more. 

Harry had been told laughingly he was to expect a 
very plain dinner. 

" And is that the result of having two expert cooks in 
the house ? Mrs. Welles, I 've been petting my digestion 
for the last month in order to cope with the culinary pro- 
ductions of the pair of you, and this is the result. I 've 
heard before that too many cooks spoil the broth, but I 
didn't know it extended to the whole dinner." 

Although Molly had made the meringues herself, she 
had written the recipe, which is as follows : 



224 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

Beat the white of two eggs as stiff as possible, that is 
to say, till it will not slip out of the bowl, then stir into 
it ve7'y gently three ounces of powdered sugar, remem- 
bering the rule that anything to be mixed with white of 
egg must be done with a light lifting motion of the spoon, 
rather than stirring^ which may liquefy the eggs. Fill 
a table-spoon with the mixture and turn on to a sheet of 
white paper placed on a board which has been made a 
little damp; the moulds should be oval, like half an egg. 
Put them in a very cool oven for fifteen or twenty min- 
utes, then open the door and leave them ten minutes 
longer ; the idea is to make the crust as thick as possible, 
which is done by the long slow drying ; if firm enough 
remove them from the paper, take out the moist centre 
very carefully, and when cold fill them with cream, 
flavored, sweetened, and whipped solid (recipe Chapter 
XXVIIL), then put two together ; they should be over 
full, and the cream show considerably between the two 
sides. 



CHAPTER XXXV. 

MACAROONS JUMBLES GENOESE TABLETTES — 

IRISH STEW. 

The next day Mrs. Welles and Molly were in the 
kitchen bright and early. She had ordered the day be- 
fore all she would need for dinner, and did not require 
to leave the house. They^had planned to make maca- 
roons and fancy cakes. For the macaroons, half a 
pound of almond paste and three quarters of a pound of 
powdered sugar were weighed carefully, then three 
large eggs were separated and beaten. Mrs. Welles 
put the almond paste in the chopping-bowl, and chopped 
it into fine crumbs (which saves a good deal of mashing 
with a fork), while Molly beat eggs and added the sugar, 
making icing, in fact; then the crumbled almond paste 
was put to it and mashed with the back of a fork into 
the icing, till it was all smooth and perfectly blended ; 
some sheets of thin paper were rubbed with suet and 
cut to fit the dripping-pan, on which they were to be 
baked ; half a tea-spoonful was dropped on a bit of 
paper, and put in to try the oven, and meanwhile a 
dozen or so of almonds were blanched and each split 
into six. 

The macaroon, when looked at, had flattened down, as 
it should do, but just a shade more than was just right, 
and a tea-spoonful more powdered sugar was stirred in. 
Then the mixture was taken up on the end of a tea- 
spoon, and bits as large as small nutmegs were dropped 
on the greased paper, — about two inches apart, — and 
then on each of them three or four bits of almond were 
put irregularly. The oven was moderate, — not too 
cool, nor yet hot enough to color them till they had 
been in it ten minutes.

226 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" While you bake those, I '11 make some Genoese 
pastry," said Mrs. Welles. 

" That is a novelty to me ; at least, I have heard of it, 
but not tried it. If I remember rightly you told me you 
had once tried it, but found it very unsatisfactory." 

" Yes, it was too sticky while warm to cut, and too 
brittle when cold, but I have now another recipe which 
I want to try, and if it is good it will be just the thing 
for your fancy cakes. This is the recipe : 

" Genoese pastry. — Four ounces of flour, three of 
butter, four of almond paste, and five eggs. Melt the 
butter in a bowl, taking care it does not get very hot. 
Break the eggs into a bowl, add the sugar to 
them, stand the bowl in a saucepan of boiling water, and 
whip eggs and sugar for twenty minutes, but they must 
not get very hot ; take the bowl from the water, add the 
almond paste, crumbled fine, to it, beat till smooth, then 
add the butter, and last of all slip in the flour, stirring 
lightly all the time ; bake, in a round jelly-cake-pan 
lined with buttered paper very neatly fitted and stand- 
ing an inch above the edge, in a rather quick oven for 
half an hour. When it is done, no mark should remain 
on it when pressed with the finger." 

*' Has any one you know tried the recipe ? " 

" Oh, yes ; and I have eaten the cake, and found it 
excellent." 

Molly now opened the oven to look at the macaroons, 
and found they could be put for one minute at the top, 
to take a deeper tint, and another pan which she had 
ready could be put in the bottom of the oven. 

Then she prepared one more sheet, after taking the 
first from the oven. These she left on the pan to cool 
a few minutes before touching them ; then she lifted 
the paper from it, replaced it by a fresh one, and did not 
attempt to take the macaroons from the paper till they 
were nearly cold. She handled them after they were 
baked, and until cold, as if they were egg shells. 

Marta, who had now finished her morning's work, was 
told to put on the bouillon. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 227 

" You must take the largest pot, Marta ; that shin 
weighs eight pounds. It is cut in three, but gash it 
well, take out the marrow, and put on eight quarts of 
cold water; when it is near tlie boiling-point, skim it, — 
take care the scum does not break. After it is off, throw 
iu a wine-glass of cold water and- wait ; when it is once 
again near boiling, skim again ; repeat the cold water 
and skimming twice, then leave it to boil four hours 
very slowly." 

When separating the yolks of eggs from the whites, 
for the macaroons, they had been at once beaten with 
a tea-spoonful of cold water to prevent hardening, — 
which they are apt to dp when waiting even a very 
short time, if not beaten, — and set aside for jumbles, 
which Molly made while Mrs. Welles made the Genoese 
pastry. She used for them six ounces of butter, six 
ounces of sugar, and half a pound of flour, with the 
yolks of the three eggs. The butter was beaten to a 
cream and then the sugar and eggs added, the flour sifted 
in, a table-spoonful of wine put in, and when all was 
well mixed a few drops of extract of rose was added, 
Molly tasting the paste to judge the quantity. It needed 
to be perceptible, as it goes off in baking. Then she 
rolled it into little balls about the size of a hickory nut, 
and on some stuck half a blanched almond, on others a 
little bit of green citron, and on others a strip of candied 
lemon peel. 

Rolling them thus was much less trouble than cut- 
ting them into rings and shaping them in sugar, and 
quite as sightly, for the balls melt down in the oven into 
round cakes. They require a moderate oven ; if too 
slow they melt too much, if too quick they burn before 
they are done. 

To keep the oven just right this morning when a 
steady, moderate heat was required, Molly attended to 
the fire herself. Having seen that it was solid at first, 
she kept it so by adding a very few coals before it had 
shown any signs of going down. As soon as the jum- 
bles were firm and the bright yellow had changed to the 



228 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

palest pine color, they were taken out, without waiting 
for them to brown at all. 

The Genoese pastry was now done ; it looked like a 
thick jelly-cake, and when cool was to be cut and jelly- 
laid between it sandwich-fashion, and some pieces iced 
plain. 

When the macaroons were taken off the papers, there 
were found to be between seyenty and eighty, but as in 
two pans there were two or three that had sunken some- 
what and were less handsome than the rest, those were 
laid aside. There were also nearly four dozen jumbles, 
and there would be about three dozen taUettes from the 
Genoese pastry. 

It was getting near luncheon time and they were both 
rather tired ; therefore they gave up till after they had 
eaten and rested. 

" I hope, Molly, you take care of yourself in this 
way," said her friend as they sat down to a comfortable 
lunch. -' I remember how you used to horrify me in Lon- 
don by going without food for hours, or only eating cake 
or pastry, if you had anything on hand to interest you.*' 

" Yes, nowadays I do, whether I feel hungry or not : 
I sit down and force myself to eat, and I do it leis- 
urely also, for if I finish eating in ten minutes I take 
a book or newspaper and spend the full hour resting, 
then I go to work fresh again ; although I confess I 
do it often in spite of my neryes, which urge me to fin- 
ish. But I do it, and I know that eating nothing at all 
or a mere snack in a hurry, at noon, and then keeping 
on with the sewing, or preserving, or shopping, is what 
wears out half us American women. I used to get tired 
and faint about three o'clock, after doing very little, 
and was almost ashamed that I, a healthy young girl, 
should do so when I saw elderl}^ women keep on from 
morning till night. You and your mother first awakened 
me to the fact that it was lack of food. My own dear 
mother had been like myself all her life, neglecting her 
noon meal, simply because she never felt hungry. Now 
I get a meal of some substantial kind, and I make Marta

do the same, for she also is inclined to take a standing 
lunch, — just a bit of bread and cheese, she likes best." 

"Well, I don't believe people can work well if they 
do not eat sensibly. I can eat three meals comfortably, 
but I agree with Dr. Richardson : we could do without 
both the others better than the mid-day meal. 1 suppose 
if you and I had kept on for a couple of hours longer we 
should have been a pair of wilted beings." 

" Yes, there is nothing like leaving off and resting 
before one is really tired, if one wants to get through a 
great deal without feeling it ; but it is a very difficult 
thing to do." 

" I know it ; especially difficult to those who need it 
most, — the nervous, energetic women ; to the phleg- 
matic ones it comes easy enough, and they seldom over- 
work." 

"I have eaten the last of your 'weal and hammer,' 
my dear, and I agree with Silas Wegg : ' it mellars the 
organ,' — and now I am ready for work. The next 
thing is to ice those cakes, I suppose, and I will put on 
the sugar to boil." 

" No, I have French icing ready, but I forgot until 
this minute to make some coloring ; I bought the cochi- 
neal yesterday." 

" AVell, there's plenty of time ; it will only take a few 
minutes ; I '11 put it to boil and we will both get the 
Genoese cakes ready while it does so." 

Molly handed to her a packet containing an ounce of 
cochineal and one of cream of tartar, mixed ; this was 
put to boil in half a pint of water, and was to reduce to 
half. While this was going on Molly got out some 
raspberry jam and the lemon paste she had made. 

" I wonder what I should have done if these good 
things had not come so apropos!" — alluding to her 
mother-in-law's gift. 

" Done, my dear? You would not have felt the lack 
of them ; you would just have made your jumbles and 
some cocoanut macaroons and cones ; made some sponge 
drop-cakes, which you would have iced, and would have 



230 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

forgotten to wish even that you had not the other 
things ; I know you, Molly." 

Molly laughed. " To tell the truth, I had thought the 
matter over, and decided to make some orange paste, for 
which I have a very old recipe, and as two oranges are 
enough, it would not have been very costly." 

" Before I go away I want to try it, if oranges are to 
be got yet, out here." 

" I saw a few pale things, but Harry can bring some 
early Floridas." 

As they talked they worked. The bread-board was 
put between them, and the Genoese cake was split care- 
fully into four even layers. The rounded sides were 
trimmed off wide enough to cut into odd-shaped pieces 
to be dipped into icing. 

The cochineal had now boiled fast about ten minutes 
uncovered, and by the rim round the little saucepan 
showed it had diminished to one-half. 

"• Now if one can avoid getting one's fingers in it, 
and looking like an executioner for a day or two, it will 
be very nice ; where 's the alum, Molly ? " 

Molly handed the tiny packet containing two drachms 
of alum to Mrs. Welles. It was put into the cochineal, 
stirred, and then a small strainer was put on a cup, a 
piece of muslin laid in it, and the coloring poured 
through it ; then the ends of the muslin were gathered 
together and the sediment gently pressed with a spoon 
and then thrown away. 

Molly, meanwhile, had been spreading one of the 
layers of cake with the lemon paste, very thinly, and 
laid another on top of it, — this was one cake ; the other 
layer was spread with raspberry jam, and on that also 
a slice was laid. I have said that the rounded sides 
were cut off, leaving the centre square. These sides 
were cut into three-cornered pieces ; there were, conse- 
quently, a number of these corner pieces, and two 
square cakes, — one with raspberry jam, one with 
lemon. Molly had brought out the French or fondant 
icing, the vanilla flavoring, the bitter almond, and the 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 231 

caramel coloring. She divided the icing, putting one 
part into a small bowl which she set in a saucepan of 
boiling water, stirring it till it was creamy. Mrs. Welles 
had laid a sheet of confectioner's paper on the board, 
and when the icing was melted, Molly brought it to the 
table and put to it a very small half tea-spoonful of va- 
nilla, and stirred it ; then she dipped a table-spoon in the 
boiling water, shook the water from it and then took it 
full of the icing from the bowl and poured it on the 
layers of cake containing the lemon, and spread it, using 
more icin^ as she needed it, smoothinij it with a knife 
dipped into boiling water and shaken. 

When it was done, Mrs. Welles warmed a knife and 
cut the cake into neat tablettes an inch wide and two 
inches long, while Molly put the same icing over the 
fire, stirred it slowly till the water under it was boil- 
ing, and the icing creamy. She took it to the table, 
colored it a bieautiful creamy coffee color with a few 
drops of caramel, and then dropped the corner pieces, 
one by one, as fast as she could, into it, taking them out 
as soon as they were covered, and laying them on the 
waxed paper with a fork. Before half were done the icing 
got stiff, and she had to put it on the fire once more ; 
and this time, as each heating up made the icing a degree 
higher candy, she put in a few drops of water from the 
end of a spoon, — a dozen drops perhaps in all, — then 
the icing became creamy again. She finished dipping 
the cakes, all but three or four, for which the icing fell 
short. Now the other portion of icing was put in a 
bowl, melted to cream in boiling water, a few drops 
of cochineal added to it, and a few drops (very few) of 
almond flavoring. The cochineal made it a beautiful 
pale pink. This was laid on the tablette of cake in which 
was raspberry jam, in the same way as the white, and it 
also was cut into tablettes while Molly dipped the rest 
of her three-cornered pieces of cake into the pink icing. 

There was now a plate of pink, almond-iced tablettes 
with raspberry jam ; one of white, vanilla-iced tablettes 
with lemon filling, and on the sheet of waxed paper lay 



232 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

several that looked like large, oblong, French candies, 
pink and pale coffee-colored, — being completely covered 
with icing, no one could tell they were cake. 

" Now the cakes are all made, are they not?" asked 
Mrs. Welles. 

" Yes ; but I 'm sadly afraid people will think they 
have cost much more than is usually spent at these 
meetings ; but I know they have not. Mrs. Framley 
had sponge cnke only, yet the eggs alone for the five 
loaves she made would cost more than these cakes." 

" Well, it can't be helped," said Mrs. Welles. 

" No," laughed Molly ; " I meant only to have the 
iced jelly cakes, and though Genoese is so delicious I 
don 't know that that difference will be understood, but 
your bringing the almond paste tempted me into the 
macaroons, and then to make use of the yolks ; of course 
they led to the jumbles." 

" Yes, but they would pass ; it is the ' Frenchy ' look 
of the iced cakes that will seem costly, but you can tell 
your friends what the cost really is." 

" I know, only 1 hate to seem to lay myself out; yet 
when things can be made so pretty one can't resist do- 
ing it." 

" You can't, because you love the work as others love 
Kensington stitch and can't resist adding to the beauty 
of their surroundings in that way. You and I resist 
that temptation very well, but this makes one under- 
stand it. All work is pleasure if you love it and know 
how to do it." 

" Now I 'II see the dinner on and we '11 adjourn and 
leave Marta in possession," said Molly. 

Molly looked at the bouillon^ which had been simmer- 
ing four hours ; and Marta asked if she should put in 
the vegetables. 

" No ; this is to be extra strong, in fact consomme, — 
which means bouillon very much reduced, — so this can 
simmer two hours more; then strain the meat from it, 
and to-morrow you can take oif all fat ; and then put to 
it two carrots cut up small, two turnips, two onions, 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 233 

and let them boil in it two hours; this will reduce it 
enough ; then it can be strained and cleared." 

Molly liad arranged to have for dinner just such 
things as Marta could cook, but the substantial part of 
it was to be Irish stew, that good old savory dish. Ex- 
cellent as it is when well made, there is nothing more 
" poverty seeming" than the same thing carelessly done ; 
therefore she meant to see it all on to cook before leav- 
ing the kitchen. 

Irish Stew. — Half a dozen lean chops from the 
neck were floured and put in a saucepan with two onions 
and a tea-spoonful of butter, and quickly browned ; but 
the onion was not allowed to burn, and therefore it was 
all kept moving about. A pint of cold water was then 
put to it, and the fat that this brought to the surface 
skimmed off and a tea-spoonful of salt and one third 
of a tea-spoonful of pepper added. It was put where 
it would simmer very gently for an hour and a half, 
when it was to be again skimmed, and a tea-spoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce put to it ; the gravy tasted to see if 
salt enough, and half a dozen large potatoes (or more 
if small) cut in half ; then it was to be closely covered 
and was to simmer for another hour. Molly cautioned 
Marta against adding more water. 

" When you put the potatoes in, never mind if the 
gravy does not cover them ; they are to stew over the 
meat ; sufficient good gravy to serve is all that is neces- 
sary, if you cover the potatoes with liquid as often is 
done, you get a good deal of broth, but no gravy." 



CHAPTER XXXVI. 

TO BOIL AND PREPARE LOBSTER SANDWICHES 

CLEARING SOUP OMELET SOUFFLE. 

The next morning the lobster which Molly had or- 
dered was sent ; it was quite a large one, and it was put 
on head downward into boiling water in which there 
were four table-spoonfuls of salt to the gallon. Marta 
was told to let it boil gently half an hour, then to take 
it out, as if it boils too long the meat becomes tough and 
stringy ; but, although Marta had that order and Molly 
left the kitchen to go through her usual morning duties 
up-stairs, Mrs. Welles noticed that when the half hour 
was up Molly herself went to see that Marta had not 
forgotten. 

" My dear Molly, a Marta would be the death of me, 
or I of her, if I had one." 

'' Why ? " 

" She requires such endless looking after. Why don't 
you get a more experienced girl ? " 

" Because perhaps the experienced girl would be the 
' death of me.' I mean it is unlikely the experience 
would exactly fit my needs, and if it did not, it would be 
in the way of her learning my ways." 

" Does Marta learn ? " 

" Indeed she does — slowly ; but remember, she is so 
newly arrived." 

*' Oh, it is not her accomplishments I disparage, but 
that you cannat trust her to carry out such a simple or- 
der as to take a thing out of water at a certain time. 
What made you give the order if you did not expect to 
have it remembered ? " 

" Moral effect, I suppose," laughed Molly. " I always 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 235 

pretend to leave things to Marta, but as a matter of 
fact, it was the very simplicity of this thing that made 
me careful ; Marta is impressed, I find, with large ap- 
pearances ; if I tell her to do something that is to have 
some very choice result, although I expect her to blun- 
der, she generally surprises me by carrying out the or- 
der well, because she is impressed, and all her attention 
on the alert. 8he can do three or four things now she 
is proud of ; one is frying, because she has completely 
mastered the art, and the results are so showy ; then she 
has lived in Germany as scullion, where she has heard 
fine cooking spoken of with respect, and knows it is 
worth doing well. The difficulty lies generally in the 
fact that half our servants don't know that there is such 
a thing as standard cooking ; anything beyond their ken 
is ' new-fangled,' and is a mystery not worth knowing." 

" Well, well, I admire your patience ; I never could 
emulate it." 

" Oh, yes, you would, if it were only necessary ; but 
with you it is not ; you have several servants, and can 
import your cooks specially trained." 

" Molly, I could do without servants easily ; I would, 
rather than watch and follow as you do Marta." 

" We '11 talk over this another time. I 'm sure you 
would not, for long, like to do without a pair of willing, 
if clumsy hands; a dirty servant, I grant, you are better 
without, — but I must go down." 

" And I too. What shall I do ? " 

" Make mayonnaise for the sandwiches. 

" Put on the soup, Marta, and the vegetables in it as 
I told you yesterday." 

The lobster was now cool, and Molly began to pre- 
pare it. She took off the claws, split it down the back, 
then called Marta to watch as she removed the entrail 
that runs through the tail. " In the head is found a 
small bladder or bag which must be taken out ; it is 
sometimes called the ' lady ; ' and along each side, under 
the shell, will be found bits of a drab-colored spongy 
substance called the 'lady's fingers;' they are at the 



236 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

root of the small claws ; when these are removed, all 
the rest of the lobster is good. This soft, greenish fat 
might seem to you should be thrown away, but it is, 
many think, the best part of the lobster." 

The claws were then cracked and the meat taken out. 
Molly then made a pint of white sauce and divided it 
into two parts. Into one she put the meat of the lobster 
chopped fine, and seasoned it very highly with pepper 
and salt, and enough lemon juice to give a perceptible 
acid or piquant taste, and two tea-spoonfuls of very 
finely chopped pickled cucumber. 

To the other sauce she stirred the contents of a box 
of chicken also chopped fine, and a large table-spoonful 
of the mayonnaise, which was made rather more tart 
than usual, and this also was seasoned highly and a tea- 
spoonful of capers stirred through it. Both the lobster 
and chicken were put away till time to cut sandwiches. 

The dinner was to be oysters on the half shell and 
stewed steak, as being easy and British. 

The recipe was given to Marta, who, with a little 
looking after, could prepare it. It was as follows : — 

Put a table-spoonful of butter in a stew-pan ; when 
hot lay in a pound and a half of the tender side of round 
steak floured, having removed nearly all fat. Let it 
quickly brown with one onion, cut in slices ; then put to 
it a pint of boiling water. Draw it to the side of the 
fire, where it will just simmer for two hours and a half; 
then take the meat up on a hot dish, and skim the gravy 
clear of fat ; stir into it a dessert-spoonful of brown 
thickening (see recipe, Chapter XIII.), and a half can 
of mushrooms, with the liquor. Let this boil fast till 
there is about half a pint ; season with pepper and salt, 
take off the little skin of grease that fast boiling has 
sent to the surface, draw it back from the fire, and lay 
the steak in again ; let it all just keep at the hoiling- 
•point, not boil, for a quarter of an hour. 

Harry was to come home at five to get dinner over, 
and by way of a sweet dish they were to have omelette 
souffle, or as Harry called it, hot ice cream ; it was 



TEN DOLLARS ENOU(JH. 237 

quickly made and required no sauce. After luncheon, 
as there was nothing more to he done till the consomme 
was ready to clear, Molly and her friend went out to 
walk. At half a mile distance there was a spot where 
Molly had remarked the lovely ferns and moss ; they 
took a basket to bring some home to dress the rooms, 
and as there were few flowers, they gathered the white 
plumes of the wild carrot. 

" I think we will resist the golden-rod, graceful as it 
is ; every room in Greenfield has a bunch of it, no 
doubt." 

When in the house two ginger-jars were filled with 
the ferns and tall white blossoms ; from one, long sprays 
of honeysuckle from their own piazza were trailing, 
and this was put on the little stand in the hall. The 
other jar was put in the fireplace in the parlor. About 
the rooms tufts of bright red geraniums were set in 
specimen glasses. • 

" I think that looks quite festive," said Mrs. Welles, 
surveying the eifect. " Will you have autumn leaves 
for the buffet ? " 

"I confess I don't like them in rooms, beautiful as 
they are on trees ; I thought of filling those tall jars 
with these ferns and putting single sprays of them in 
tall champagne glasses between the dishes of sand- 
wiches." 

" That will be prettier." 

Molly had decided, as Marta would be a shy and pos- 
sibly awkward waitress, to have everything except soup 
and coffee arranged prettily on the sideboard, and every 
gentleman could help himself and a lady. The coffee 
and consomme would be sent round, and a small table 
had a tea-equipage arranged on it. Mrs. Welles would 
steer Marta to safety, when she should start with the 
waiter. It was a matter for discussion whether Marta 
should be called u[)on at all, and she was admitted to 
service simply as a pleasure to herself ; Molly knew she 
would be greatly disappointed if she were not allowed to 
take some active part in the proceedings. 



238 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" You are a curious girl, Molly," Mrs. Welles had 
said when she heard Molly's reason. " It would not 
have occurred to me." 

•' Nor to me, perhaps, if I had not remembered that 
this girl has no acquaintances about here, and to the 
festive German nature to sit in a quiet kitchen, and 
hear voices and laughter, must be infinitely more dull 
than makinor herself useful and seeing the faces of those 
who laugh and talk. I can see she is quite excited by 
the thought of numbers of people." 

The sideboard was moved into the pantry off the din- 
ing-room ; two Albert biscuit boxes were put, one at 
each end of it, a small board (one of a set of hanging 
book-shelves removed for the occasion) was placed on 
them and then covered with a fine white napkin ; at 
each end a vase of ferns, and along it, disposed so that 
the colors would show to best advantage, were the iced 
cakes and macarooifs. On the sideboard itself another 
long white napkin was laid, and here were to be the 
dishes of sandwiches ; the arrangement of this before- 
hand freed Molly from anxiety, and when the door of 
the pantry was closed it was not seen ; yet with it open 
the sideboard was so placed that it and nothing else was 
visible from the room. A bracket lamp was to be fas- 
tened so as to light it up as much as the interior of the 
dining-room. When the arrangements were all made, 
Mrs. Welles and Molly repaired to the kitchen. The 
dinner was quietly cooking and Marta had just got 
through her work. 

" I will clear the soup first, because I want you to 
see it, Marta." Molly took the two whites of eggs and 
their shells left from the mayonnaise and two more ; 
then she beat up shells and all to a froth, mixed a small 
cup of the cold soup with them, and poured the whole 
into the soup, beating all the while till it was at boil- 
ing-point again ; then she drew it back from the fire 
and left it ten minutes. While it settled, she put a 
large mixing-bowl on the table, and a colander in that ; 
then an old napkin, that she had dipped into boiling 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 239 

water and wrung out, was laid over the colander. In 
ten minutes the egg was hanging in the soup like white 
curds and the soup itself looked quite clear. 

It was poured through the cloth and allowed to drip. 
Molly lifted the colander, and when the soup had run 
through removed it without squeezing. The soup lay in 
the bowl like clear weak tea. Molly added a few drops 
of caramel (see Chapter XIII.), and then tasted it for 
seasoning. The caramel only made it a shade darker 
than it was, just a bright straw color. The boiling with 
the vegetables had reduced it to about five quarts. In- 
tending it to be so reduced had caused Molly to omit 
part of the salt ; if salted for eight quarts and reduced to 
■five it would be too salt to use, as salt never evaporates. 

The soup was now put into a marbleized preserving- 
pan, which would give no more taste than a china 
bowl, and be ready to boil up when required. 

Mrs. Welles had, meanwhile, been cutting sandwiches, 
and already had quite a pile of thin slices of bread, 
which Molly now spread thinly with mayonnaise. When 
two loaves were cut up, Mrs. Welles put a thin layer of 
the chicken mixture on some of the slices Molly had 
spread with mayonnaise ; then put another slice over it, 
and when a good many were done, the crust was cut off 
all round and each slice cut from corner to corner, thus 
making four little three-cornered sandwiches. When 
there were enough of these done, they treated the lob- 
ster in the same way^ and when all were cut and ar- 
ranged on dishes a damy cloth was laid over them, and 
they were put in a cool place till just before they were 
needed. Everything was now ready. Mrs. Winfield's 
reserve cups and saucers had all been got out and 
dusted ; Mrs. Lennox had sent over a dozen. These 
were put in readiness, with piles of small plates, nap- 
kins, etc., on a large tray to be brought in and placed 
by the sideboard when the time came. 

Omelet Souffle. — Molly beat four whites of eggs 
till they would not slip from the bowl, just before din- 
ner, and then the yolks of two she beat four minutes

with three table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar and one 
tea-spoonful of vanilla extract. 

When Marta was ready to put the dinner on the table, 
Molly turned the whites of the eggs on the yolks, and 
mixed them very gently, lijting the yolks as it were over 
the whites with the spoon, not stirring them ; an}^ quick 
movement with whites of eggs tends to liquefy them ; 
then she buttered an oval dish and heaped the mixture 
lightly on it, a table-spoonful at a time, piling always 
towards the middle ; then she sifted powdered sugar 
over it, and just before she went in to dinner she put it 
in the oven, which was moderately hot. 

" It will take about ten minutes to get a golden 
brown, Marta, and w^hen you look at it be careful not to 
fully open the door, for the least draught may cause it 
to fall ; and when it is nicely brown bring it in without 
waiting for anything. I will have the table ready for 
you." 



CHAPTER XXXVII. 

GATEAU DE RIZ FRENCH RICE CAKE PREPARING 

calf's HEAD MOCK-TURTLE SOUP MORE 

NOODLES — PIGEON PIE. 

Of course Molly's supper was a success, and of course 
there were many who thought it must have cost a great 
deal more than the amount usually expended ; but when 
there was a comparison of expenses there was nothing 
to be said, for Molly was well within the lowest, and 
then every one wanted to know how it was done, and es- 
pecially how the sandwiches were made, such a pleasant 
change were they from the usual thing, good as it is. 
Molly was not experienced in quantities needed, and had 
feared something might fall short, but there were both 
consomme and cakes left. 

*' Shall we have to live on ' stale party ' the rest of 
the week, Molly ? " Harry had asked. 

" You '11 have ' stale party ' soup a couple of times, but 
no other reminiscence shall be served up." 

And to give Marta an opportunity of showing her way 
of making noodles to Mrs. Welles, Molly decided to have 
noodle soup and roast beef for dinner. 

They all three set to work to remove the traces of the 
night before. While Marta swept, Molly and her friend 
washed up dishes and returned them to their places. 
When all was done, Molly said, " What can I make with 
the spare yolks of eggs from yesterday?" 

" How many are there ? " 

" Four, — two from the omelette souffle and two 
from clearing the soup." 

" Then make a French rice cake for dinner." 

" You make it. for I don't know how. And how you

are here, I want to cook a calf's head. You are fond of 
it, I know, and one is too much for us alone ; besides, 
there are so many English ways of cooking it. I only 
know one." 

" Get the head, and I will show you half a dozen dishes 
from it. Do you want mock-turtle soup?" 

" Yes, I think so." 

" Then we will use half for that purpose, and the other 
we will do various things with." 

Molly had already ordered her butcher to get one for 
her one day this week. He had sent word it would 
be ready this morning, and she was expecting it. 

Calf's head, although a fashionable dish, either as 
mock-turtle or any of the several ways in which it is 
served, is, like some other things with an awe-inspiring 
name, a very economical one, especially in country places, 
where calves' heads have few buyers. For this reason 
Molly wanted to perfect herself in preparing it. By the 
time Mrs. Welles had put a small cup of rice on to boil 
in a pint and a half of milk, the head came. She watched 
the rice come to the boil, then put it where it would sim- 
mer slowly, and turned her attention to the head. It 
was a very good one, for Molly had said if it were not 
fat she would not care to have it. She had also directed 
it to be split. He had asked her if she wanted it skinned. 

" No, indeed ; only scalded and the hair scraped off." 

*' I only asked, because some folks like them skinned." 

Molly was relating this to Mrs. Welles and preparing 
her to see the head either skinned in spite of her order, 
or else sent with the hair half on when it came, but it 
was really very well dressed. 

" I 'm going to let you prepare it, Charlotte, and look 
on, for I have only seen it done once at a cooking-demon- 
stration." 

" Very well, you attend to the rice, then, and keep it 
from burning. It must stew slowly, with the cover tight 
on it, till it will mash into a paste, and more milk added 
if required." 

Mrs. Welles laid the head open on a meat-board, and 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 243 

then removed the tongue and brains, being very careful 
not to injure them. She laid them in a dish of water, in 
which was a small cup of vinegar, until they were needed 
for use ; then she took out the membrane of the nasal 
passages and washed the head in salt and water. This 
done, she put the head in a pot and covered it with six 
quarts of cold water. It was to boil very slowly two 
hours. Into the water she put a large carrot, a turnip, 
and an onion, with six sprigs of parsley, two bay leaves, 
half a tea-spoonful of marjoram and the same of thyme 
(these herbs were tied up in a bit of muslin), and a 
small table-spoonful of salt, with half a tea-spoonful of 
pepper. 

By the time this was done the rice was cooked thor- 
oughly, and it was as stiif as could be stirred and turned 
out into a bowl, when it was sweetened, a tiny pinch 
of salt put into it, a large tea-spoonful of vanilla extract, 
and the grated rind of a lemon ; and when a little cool, 
the beaten yolks of eggs, and all was stirred together. It 
was now about the consistence of stiff mush. A square 
shallow pan was thickly buttered, and strewed with bread 
crumbs, and the rice put into it. The pan used was a 
small-sized dripping-pan, and the rice formed a layer 
an inch and a half deep. It was made very smooth over 
the top, and then a little butter was oiled and poured on 
it ; the pan was then so moved that the butter ran over 
the rice in every direction ; sugar was then sifted all 
over it a quarter of an inch deep, and the whole was put 
in the oven to bake till a fine brown. 

" If you want that to be extra fine, Molly, at any time, 
chop a cup of almonds quite fine, and strew them over 
with the sugar. When it is baked, let it get cold in the 
pan, then turn it out and cut it into strips or tablets an 
inch broad and two or three in length. They should be 
put on a dish in the ice-box before serving, to be ice 
cold." 

When the calf's head had been boiling very slowly 
two hours, it was taken carefully from the water and one 
half of it was laid aside ; the other half was to be for 



244 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

dinner. This was wiped, the inside bones carefully 
taken out, and it was closely scored through the outer 
skin ; then it was washed over with a beaten egg and 
thickly covered with fine bread crumbs, in a cup of which 
half a tea-spoonful of salt, half a salt-spoonful of pepper, 
a tea-spoonful of finely-chopped parsley, and the third of 
one of thynae or savory, had been thoroughly mixed. This 
was to be basted with butter melted in a cup until all 
the crumbs were moistened, and then baked till brown. 
If the crumbed surface looked dry in the oven, it must 
be again basted. This was to be garnished with little 
■ rolls of bacon, made by cutting thinnest slices, trimmed 
from rind and smoke, rolled round the finger, and laid 
on a tin in a quick oven till clear and crisp, but not over- 
done. 

Mrs. Welles got everything ready early, put the half 
head on the dish ready to go into the oven at five o'clock, 
cut the bacon, and told Molly what the gravy was to be, 
so that she might make it while she herself went on with 
mock -turtle soup, which was for next day's (Sunday) 
dinner. 

" You can have almost any sauce ; English sauce 
piquante is very nice, or brown mushroom sauce." 

" What is English sauce piquante ? " 

" I call it so, although the old-fashioned name for it is 
Wow Wow sauce." 

" Let 's try it, if you like it. ' 

" I do. This is the recipe : Chop fine a dessert-spoon- 
ful of capers, the same of parsley, and one large pickled 
walnut or two small. Put a table-spoonful of flour and 
one of butter to get brown together in a saucepan ; put 
to them, stirring all the time, half a pint of stock or the 
broth you have — that in which the head was boiled 
will do ; when it boils, mix a tea-spoonful of dry mus- 
tard with a table-spoonful of wine, half one of vinegar, 
and a tea-spoonful of red currant or cranberry jelly, and 
one of Worcestershire sauce. Let all simmer till of a 
creamy thickness, season to taste, and last add the capers 
and pickles. It is a convenient sauce, because you can

vary the flavor as you like, patting pickled cucumber in- 
stead of walnut or capers, any other store sauce instead 
of Worcestershire, and cider in place of wine, and if you 
have no jelly, a lump of sugar. The characteristic of the 
sauce is to be a very little sour, a very little sweet, and a 
little hot, with an agreeable flavor beside." 

The bones that had been taken from the part of the 
head that was to bake were put back in the pot, the meat 
was cut from the other half in neat pieces and laid be- 
tween two dislies to keep it flat, and all the liquor that 
ran from it, with the rest of the bones, was put back to 
boil with the liquor till it was reduced to three quarts. 

" Now, Molly, as it is imjiossible to tell how strong or 
weak dried herbs are, and mock-turtle is a highly flavored 
soup, I am going to adopt the plan of making essence of 
the herbs and use just enough." 

So saying, she put into a little saucepan two tea-spoon- 
fuls of chopped parsley, three quarters of one of mar- 
joram, three quarters of one of savory and the same of 
lemon thyme, and a bay l6af and a half. 

" Now I '11 put these to boil, closely covered, in half a 
pint of water for twenty minutes, then squeeze out as 
much of the goodness as I can, and add this herb juice 
to the soup, little by little, till we get the right flavor." 

As the soup was more than sufficient to serve for two 
dinners, it was decided to flavor it all, then divide it, and 
have one half thick mock-turtle, the other clear. The 
thick was for Sunday's dinner, as Mr. Welles, who was 
coming to dinner, was particularly fond of it. While 
the soup was boiling down Mrs. Welles prepared Qgg 
balls to serve with it, Molly made some rough puff paste 
(see Chapter VI.) for pigeon pie, and when that was 
done Marta was ready to make noodles. 

The egg balls were made as follows : Two eggs boiled 
hard, the yolks pounded with a half tea-spoonful of finely 
chopped parsley, half a salt-spoonful of salt, a scant 
quarter one of white pepper, made into stiff paste with 
raw yolk of egg, and moulded into balls, size of marbles. 
Each ball was rolled in white of egg beaten a little ; 



246 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

when well coated they were dipped in flour and dropped 
into boiling water for two minutes. These were part 
to be served in the thick soup next day, the rest left 
for the clear mock-turtle. 

Marta used one egg for the noodles, a pinch of salt, 
and flour enough to make part of it into a smooth paste 
about as large as a small egg ; this she worked smooth and 
laid aside ; to the rest she added more flour, and did not 
work into a smooth paste, but into a rough, crumbly sort 
of ball ; this, she explained, was for the quickest made 
and most generally used noodles, in the part of Germany 
she came from. She took a coarse grater and grated 
the rough ball into coarse crumbs that looked like yel- 
low tapioca ; these could be dried carefully in a very 
cool oven, and used whenever wanted. Then she took 
the smooth ball she had made, and asked Molly whether 
she would like her to make the ribbon noodles as before 
(see recipe, Chapter XXV.), or another sort. 

" Oh, another, by all means ! " 

She then grated on the staooth ball of paste just a 
suspicion of nutmeg, put the least bit of butter on her 
hand, — a bit as large as a small hazel nut, — and rolled 
the ball and worked it over till the nutmeg and butter 
were in it ; then she cut the paste into pieces as large as 
a hazel nut, made each into olive shapes, and they were 
finished. 

" Thank you, Marta, we will have those in our soup 
to-night. I think I remember eating them in Germany." 

Molly had already prepared a pair of pigeons. She 
now put on to stew very slowly, with half a pint of 
water, a pound of juicy round steak, for the pigeon pie, 
which she intended to make next day. When the steak 
had simmered an hour and a half, it was taken up and 
put away. The calf's tongue was parboiled, to be used 
on Monday. 

The next morning Molly made the pie directly after 
breakfast. Laying the steak, cut into finger-lengths, at 
the bottom of a deep oval dish, the birds were divided 
into halves, and both steak and pigeons seasoned highly 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 247 

with pepper and salt. The birds were laid over the 
steak, placing them so that the pie would be dome-shaped 
when covered; two eggs were hard boiled and cut in 
four and the pieces laid among the meat ; then a small 
half cup of water was poured in ; the gravy from the 
steak was left to pour in hot when the pie was cooked. 
The pie was then finished in the same way as the veal 
and ham pie (see recipe Chapter XXXII.), except that 
the feet of the two birds were put in boiling water for a 
moment, the skin rubbed off them, leaving them a bright 
crimson, and a slit was made at each end of the groove 
that went round the pie, and two of the little feet put in 
each, the claws outwards. 

Mrs. Welles gave Marta the pieces of calf's head that 
were to go into the soup, told her to put them in half an 
hour before dinner, let them simmer, and just before 
serving she was to put into the quart, which was all that 
was to be made hot, a table-spoonful of brown thickening, 
a glass of wine, and the juice of half a lemon, with half 
the egg balls. The pigeon pie would need an hour to 
bake, and was to be kept in a very cold place until 
twelve.

butter) CALF 'S HEAD HOLLANDAISE 

SAUCE calf's HEAD EN TORTUE. 

^* Molly, what are you going to do with all that beef 
from consomme "^ '^ asked Mrs. Welles, on the Monday 
after the reception. 

" I have usually made hash of it and given it to a family 
who need all the help they can get ; but there is so much, 
I am inclined to try an experiment. Would not part do 
to make an imitation of that mock brawn that is so good 
in London ? What is the recipe ? " 

*' That is made with new beef and pork, but if the j^lly 
can be supplied, it would be very nice and savory treated 
exactly as if it were new meat." 

" So I thought, and I got from the butcher the day I 
bought the beef two hocks of pork. It 's early for pork, 
but he assured me this was killed right on a farm here, 
and I could see it was really good, although I must say I 
think November early enough, as a rule, for pork." 

" It 's a little different when you buy it in that way. 
What are you going to do with the feet, or ' hocks ' as 
you call them ? " 

*' They have been cleaned and laid in salt ; to-morrow 
they will be salt enough. I think of boiling them till 
the bones slip out, cutting the flesh in small bits, and put- 
ting the bones back into the water and boiling till there 
is no more goodness in them ; but as the beef is over- 
cooked, I don't want the pork to be so ; then strain the 
liquor, which will be solid jelly when cold. I think two 
quarts and a pint of water may be put on the hocks, — 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 249 

that will leave rather less than two quarts when boiled 
slowly for three hours with the lid on, — then I shall 
choose the firmest pieces of the beef, cut them into large 
dice, and put them into the liquor with the pork ; but I 
want you to give me the seasoning of the regular recipe, 
if you brought it." 

" Yes ; as you wrote you wanted some English pick- 
ling and curing recipes, I brought my little book ; but 
I advise you to remember the difference in climate." 

" Yes, I do ; but I know a family who have the most 
delicious bacon and ham, and they use old country rec- 
ipes in curing." 

"Very well, then, I came. supplied." She took from 
her pocket a note-book. " The seasoning for mock 
brawn is as follows : Two tea-spoonfuls of salt, one of 
ground allspice, one of black pepper, one of sugar, half 
a tea-spoonful of marjoram dried and rubbed fine, half 
one of thyme." 

" I think I '11 use sage instead of thyme, and I fancy 
it will prove a very savory dish to eat cold." 

Of the calf's head there was still the tongue, the 
brains, nearly two quarts of clear mock-turtle soup, a 
small platter of the pieces of the head boiled, and some 
of the baked head. 

" It 's rather an absurd joint to buy for such a small 
family as ours, unless one is prepared to eat it in every 
form for three days." 

" Well, it will keep a few days, but the brains and 
tongue must be used soon, as they spoil easily. Sup- 
pose you have stewed tongue for dinner to-day, with 
brains and brown butter ? The rest of the head and 
soup can be left for a day or two this weather, and I 
will prepare them at once." 

They went to the kitchen together, and Mrs. Welles 
began by taking the skin off the tongue, which had been 
parboiled on Saturday ; then she trimmed it neatly and 
cut little strips of salt pork, parallel with the rind, as 
thick as a match, and larded it ; then she put into a small 
stone pot that had a cover two slices of fat pork, a tea- 



2o0 ti:n dollars enough. 

spoonful of chopped parsley, half an onion, a bay leaf, 
a salt-spoonful of salt, half one of pepper, and half a 
tea-spoonful of thyme. She sprinkled the tongue with 
salt and pepper, laid it in the jar, and round it cut a 
carrot in slices ; over this she poured a cup of soup and 
covered it close. It was to bake three h'ours and a 
half. When done it was to be taken up and the gravy 
strained and skimmed ; the tongue was to be laid in a 
dish, with green peas round it, and the gravy poured 
over it. 

She also cleaned the calf's brains, carefully removing 
all the slime and fibrous skin, but without breaking them ; 
then she told Marta to put them, half an hour before 
dinner, into well-salted water in which was a small bunch 
of parsley and a bay leaf, to boil for twenty minutes ; 
then she was to have ready some fried circles of bread, 
the size of a tea-cup and half an inch thick. (Hee fry- 
ing, Chapter TV.) When the brains were done they 
were to be taken up and divided, and a neat piece put 
on each round of bread, and on the centre of each a 
small piece of pickled gherkin or red beet, and then 
they were to have poured over them brown butter, made 
as follows : One table-spoonful of butter melted in a lit- 
tle saucepan till it was a pale brown (not the least 
burnt), then a tea-spoonful of lemon juice and the same 
of finely chopped parsley was to be put in it. She 
warned her if the butter should get the least bit too 
dark it would be spoilt, and it would darken even in 
carrying from the range to the table, therefore to re- 
move it as soon as the color began to change. 

The following were the ways in which the remains of 
the head were disposed of. Though Molly was tired 
of it by the time it was gone, Harry was not, and she 
could not but recommend it to Mrs. Lennox as an eco- 
nomical dish to have for a large family, provided she 
bought only a large fleshy head ; a bony one is not worth 
the trouble of cooking. 

The pieces already boiled in the soup made two small 
entrees for Wednesday and Thursday; the first was

simply some pieces simmered half an hour in a very lit- 
tle of the sou}5, then taken up and a ITollandaise sauce 
poured over it. (See recipe, Chapter XXIX.) The 
second was the quite celebrated one. 

Calf's Head en Tortue, made as follows : A 
table-spoonful of butter was melted in a saucepan, a 
table-spoonful of flour mixed with it and allowed to bul> 
ble ; then a cup of the clear soup reserved for the pur- 
pose was put to it and stirred, to make a thick, smooth 
sauce ; the juice of a large tomato (Molly used a little 
pulp of canned tomato, as the season was over) was 
strained to it, and the liquor from half a can of mush- 
rooms and a dozen of the mushrooms ; the pieces of 
meat were laid in this sauce and stewed for twenty min- 
utes very gently, with great care that they might not 
burn. While this was cooking, a small saucepan was 
put on, half full of fat, and made very hot ; then one egg 
for each person was broken into separate cups ; these 
were dropped one at a time into the smoking fat, just as if 
it were water, and they were to be poached ; one minute 
was enough to brown each one, and only one was done 
at a time, or while one was taken out the other would 
harden in the intense heat of the fat. The eggs were 
perfectly round and brown. They were laid round the 
dish of meat, and between them tiny green gherkins. 



CHAPTER XXXIX. 

IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS. 

Mrs. Lennox came in to call on Mrs. Welles later the 
same day. Her Maggie had been with her now several 
days, and she could judge bow far she was likely to be 
of use to her. Molly had been anxious to know the re- 
sult of the experiment, for she felt deeply interested in 
her neighbor, and that if Maggie should prove more a 
trial than comfort she might perhaps have contributed 
by her advice to that result. After a little conversation 
about Mrs. Welles's visit and her long acquaintance with 
Molly, the latter asked how she got on with the new in- 
mate. 

"For the first three or four days it seemed a failure, 
but I am hopeful now of better things ; she is strong, 
seems willing, and I think is trying to do. At all events 
I almost think if she never gets beyond the point of 
washing dishes, taking up ashes, making fires, preparing 
vegetables and washing I shall be the gainer, for that 
drudgery left me no time for the lighter work to be 
properly done." 

" Oh, but if she does those things willingly, and as 
you tell her, she will not stop there, I think ; Mrs. 
Framley was speaking of her sister, and says she is of 
thoroughly good stock, and that is a great deal. The 
good-for-nothing girls one meets with usually come from 
thriftless stock." 

" Well, I 'm going to hope for the best, and as I 'm not 
expecting too many of the cardinal virtues for a few dol- 
lars a month, perhaps I may not be disappointed ; and 
now, my dear Mrs. Bishop, lam going to ask you to give 
me a few recipes of economical dishes for a family like 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 253 

ours. Until I talked with you, I only knew of pot-pie 
and Irish stew, both badly made, and though I have a 
cookery-book which you tell me is excellent, I never 
made anything come quite right out of it." 

" In justice to the cooking-book, and indeed to latter 
day cooking-books in general, I think, perhaps, if you 'U 
forgive me, that may have beeu because you did not 
know enough of the elements of cooking." 

" I certainly did not, and although I know little now, 
I feel so very much wiser than I did a month ago that 
I look back in wonder. There's another reason why 
I could not use my cookery-book, — it always wanted 
something I had not in the house by way of flavoring ; 
then I shut up the book and cooked in my own old way." 

" One of your American w^orthies, ' Josiah Allen's wife,' 
I think, says: 'It's the flavorin' as does it,'" said Mrs. 
Welles ; " and I think fifty cents expended in flavorings a 
very good investment, from an economical point of view.'* 

" Yes, if one lives in New York one can buy all sorts 
of sweet herbs, and dry them. At the same time I 
don't think Mr. Lennox likes them." 

" I have known many people who thought they did 
not like them because they had never had them properly 
used, or at least when properly used they enjoyed the 
dish without knowing that it contained herbs at all ; in 
the same way I have known people who used Worcester- 
shire sauce in everything, and who would even ruin clear 
soup by pouring it in, vow and protest they could never 
touch anything that had the faintest suspicion of garlic ; 
Worcestershire sauce has more than a suspicion of garlic. 
I know others who will eat no pickles but Crosse & 
Blackwell's, which likewise owe the subtle difference be- 
tween them and all others equally to the effect of garlic ; 
so carefully used however that only by making pickles 
with and without that suspicion of the malodorous herb 
can you see why many other pickles lack ' just some- 
thing.' " 

" Well — I'm willing to be instructed, so willing that 
if I 'd time and money I would go to New York aud go 
through a course at a cooking-school." 



254 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" All ! If every young wife did that, what years of 
work and vexation she would save herself; it is sucli 
up-liill work teaching one's self from books; it's like 
trying to play a piece of music without having learned 
to count time ; after months, if you knew the notes, you 
might, by your ear, make something out of it ; but think 
of the toil ! So it is with recipes, — without the key, 
how can any one cook? to be told what goes into a pot, 
and to ' stew it eentlv ' so loner, and vou don 't know 
what gentle stewing is ! You are told to put your meat 
in the oven and bake it ' beautifully brown,' and you 
don't know that to brown beautifully your oven must be 
just so hot when it goes in, and that if you have water 
in your pan, it will steam, not bake; and soon." 

Molly smiled ; Mrs. Welles was on her hobby. 

"Yes, that's all true, and I only wish I had the first 
year of my married life to go over again, before a fam- 
ily came in the way of my doing what I would like." 

*' To revert to the question of flavorings," put in 
Molly. " I found all T wanted at the grocery ; they 
put up sweet herbs of all kinds now very nicely, in pa- 
per boxes, a box of thyme leaves (be sure and get the 
leaves rather than the powdered herb) or marjoram 
leaves cost but five cents each. Now whilfe parsley is so 
plentiful and cheap I shall buy ten cents' worth and dry 
it for winter." 

" I did not know parsley would dry and retain its fla- 
vor." 

" It will not if done as we dry other herbs ; it must be 
quickly done by heat ; if put in a cool oven with the door 
open, or in a plate-warmer, it will dry in a few hours ; then 
it can be rubbed fine and put in a tin box. I think a box 
of lemon thyme, one of savory, one of marjoram, one of 
sage, with five cents' worth of bay leaves, — twenty cents 
in all, — will give you all the herb flavorings generally 
called for, and last a year if you like them as sparingly 
used as I should use them. Spices most people have, I 
would almost say ' unluckily,' remembering how sadly too 
much spice mars much of our American cooking ; but I 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 255 

will give you several recipes, and if you have difficulty 
with them let me know. I think perhaps when the cold 
weather comes in we might do a little economy to- 
gether." 

" How ? " 

" By buying meat in large quantities, beef by the 
quarter, mutton by the half sheep ; my family is too 
small to make such a way of buying wise, but you have 
several mouths to feed, and none would go to waste." 

Mrs. Lennox looked dubious and said : 

" I used to think about it. Mr. Lennox suggested he 
should buy a quarter of beef, as he knew some one who 
did so all through the winter and found it profitable, 
but a lady who had also tried the plan told me there was 
no profit in it, for there was so much waste, — so much 
coarse meat that she could make no use of." 

" In that case there would be no real economy, but 
there need be no waste, and should be none, and no one 
need eat coarse food. I mean, properly prepared no 
part of beef need be coarse ; if a piece of brisket or flank 
were served up as a roast, or the leg broiled, that would 
indeed be coarse ; but each cooked in its appropriate way, 
they would be far from being so." 

" But the fat, — there is so much of it ! " 

" But what more useful than beef fat, or more whole- 
some ? It is next to butter, I think." 

" That is true ; but my friend, I know, could not use 
it, and said she was so thankful to see the last of that 
beef." 

" The only objection usually urged against it, and I 
think a very reasonable one, is that the family must eat 
beef or mutton, whichever is in the house, constantly till 
it is gone ; but I do not see even that necessity, for in 
cold weather the meat will keep so well that some 
change can be had, and then in winter, even for my 
small use, I would not fear to buy half a sheep ; I could 
make it keep a month, unless the weather broke ; then 
I would manage to preserve it ; but if / had mutton 
and you had beef, we could certainly change sometimes ; 



256 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

though half a sheep used during a month would not 
necessitate monotony, for one could have many things 
between." 

" What would you do with mutton fat ? " 

" That, I grant, is not so available ; but there is less 
of it, and I should try it out and make soup. The 
actual saving is considerable, especially in mutton, it 
is rare to get chops under twenty cents a pound ; leg 
fourteen, if you buy them separately, which is the fre- 
quent way, while the half sheep can be bought in Wash- 
ington Market for ten or eleven cents a pound ; the lat- 
ter is an outside price (a butcher would buy for less) 
for prime mutton, while beef hind quarter would be for 
buyers like ourselves thirteen or fourteen cents a pound, 
unless there is some temporary rise in the market, when 
of coarse one need not buy ; but that is the average 
price in New York." 

" How do you know all this ? " asked Mrs. Lennox 
in amazement. " I mean, how do you know what the 
prices are now ? " 

Molly laughed. " In this particular instance I made 
special inquiry or asked Mrs. Welles to do so ; but I 
keep pretty well up in such matters by the Saturday 
editions of some of the evening papers, although I usu- 
ally add a couple of cents a pound to the quotations for 
prime meats to allow for any difference there may be. 
I do it, however, only from curiosity, for I could not buy 
my own meat so, even if my family were large, for Mr. 
Bishop is not experienced enough to buy and send it 
out." 

"Nor is Mr. Lennox, but he has a friend who has 
bought so for years, and who also, when game and 
poultry are cheap, and I believe they often are as cheap 
as meat, sends that home to his wife too ; and Mr. Len- 
nox enjoys going with him, and once in a while has sent 
us home turkeys when they have been very low in price." 

" Then I '11 tell you what I '11 do. I '11 write out sev- 
eral recipes to use up the parts of the beef that you will 
not broil or roast, so that you will not be forced to eat 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 257 

beef exclusively in order to get rid of it before it spoils. 
I will do the same with the mutton." 

" But, my dear Mrs. Bishop, how can I possibly 
trouble you so far? What can I do for you in return ? " 

" I know something you can easily do. Let me have 
part of your beef or mutton when you get it ; we '11 take 
turns about the prime parts, — I have as much use for 
coarse ones sometimes ; and ask Mr. Lennox once in 
a while when he is buying meat with his friend and 
game is cheap, to send me out some. In ISew York 
prairie hens and partridges are sometimes a dollar a 
pair ; then they are cheaper than meat to those fond of 
them as we are. Yet Mrs. Framley says she never 
knew them less than two dollars a pair here. Then the 
writing will not be much trouble to me, for while Mrs. 
Welles is here I intend to get some recipes from her; 
the one copy will do for both of us.'' 

" I 'm afraid I 'm getting all the good of that ar- 
rangement." 

" No, it 's a case of give and take between us. You 
learn cooking from me, I learn something as valuable 
from you." 

" You are kind enough to say so." 

After Mrs. Lennox had gone, Mrs. Welles asked what 
Molly meant by saying she was learning something just 
as valuable. 

" Mrs. Lennox has the best-trained children I ever 
knew. They are full of fun and frolic, yet cheerfully 
obedient to her, and as the subject is likely to interest 
me, I have observed them very closely, and asked her 
whether they were unusually amiable or whether it was 
due to training. She told me she did not do much 
training, nor were the children specially amiable ; and it 
is true there seems less small restriction in her family 
than in most others where the children are 'regular 
pickles.' " 

" How does she manage them ? " 

" I hardly think she knows herself. She says she 
makes few rules, and those the children hardly know of ; 
17 



258 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

they only know there are a few things they dare not do ; 
but I notice they never ask her for a thing twice, and 
that is because she says she never denied anything she 
knew she might be induced to grant ; so they know 
pleading or worrying is thrown away, and four happier 
children you never saw. I asked her once if her babies 
were as good as they are when older. She said two 
were no trouble ; her first was a restless one for the 
first three months and the last was sick ; but she will 
not believe that well babies would be cross or restless if 
properly managed, and she gave me her experience with 
the first one. Of course I know nothing from experi- 
ence ; I can only observe and read and think, and I, too, 
hope to have a good baby if it is a well one." 

" Dear me ! I should not have thought Mrs. Lennox 
was a woman to have strongly-formed ideas on the sub- 
ject." 

" No, I don't believe she thinks so herself. I don't 
even know that she has formulated her ideas. She 
may have acted only on instinct, but the result is charm- 
ing ; if you were to see her children you would say so." 



CHAPTER XL. 

ENGLISH MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS PICKLING AND 

CURING ROAST BEEF-HEART — SOUSED MACKEREL. 

Mrs. Welles's visit was to have been a week only ; 
but at the end of it it seemed as if they had but just got 
to the point of enjoying each other, and Mr. Welles was 
induced to spare her for a few days longer. 

" I declare, Molly, when I came here I expected to do 
so much, both for you and myself, and I 've done noth- 
ing." 

" Oh, yes ; just consider my entertainment, what you 
did to help me in that; but there 's one thing I want 
this very day, that is, English muffins and crumpets. I 
have tried once or twice from recipes in my English 
cook-books, but they always give the quantities for a 
bakery, — a peck of flour, sometimes a bushel, — and it 
is difficult to reduce to my small needs; besides, I know 
success depends on consistency, and there is very little 
guidance given. ' Water to make a soft dough ' is only 
stated ; how soft is not hinted, and the so-called English 
muffins in our books are very good as muffins, only they 
don't happen to be the thing at all." 

"I know it is really only a question of consistency. I 
will make some this very day, if you have yeast in the 
house." 

" Yes, I am especially anxious to have them, because 
they are as good two days old as one, and in a little fam- 
ily like ours that is a great thing." 

It was Monday, and by the time the muffins had risen, 
washing would be over and the top of the fire free. 

" We '11 go out and set them now." 

The setting was very simple, being only the making 



260 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

of a stiff bread-sponge. Half a cake of yeast was dis- 
solved in a pint and a half of warm milk, into which a 
scant tea-spoonful of salt, two of sugar and one large 
one of butter warmed, were stirred. Into this as much 
dry, sifted flour was mixed {about three pints) as would 
make an exceedingly stiff batter, in fact " stiffer than 
batter, softer than dough " may serve as an indication of 
the consistency, or " almost too stiff to stir, quite too soft 
to knead." When this was beaten long and hard, one 
third was put into another bowl and this was thinned 
down with warm milk to a batter that would pour 
slowly. This was for crumpets, the only difference be- 
tween the two being in consistency. They were cov- 
ered and put behind the range to rise. 

*'Now let me have your book, Charlotte; I have the 
time, and will copy out what I want ; but first give me a 
recipe for cooking beef heart. I remember what a good 
dish it was, and they are only ten or fifteen cents each, 
and there must be at least two pounds of solid meat in 
one." 

" There is ; the only objection is the quickness with 
which heart chills, and the taste of cold suet is very dis- 
agreeable. This may be obviated by careful prepara- 
tion, however ; here is the recipe : 

" Cut off the gristle and the' deaf ear,' as the tough 
red lobe at the top is called, if the butcher has not done 
it, and trim off all the fat as closely as possible ; then lay 
the heart in boiling water for half an hour, keeping it 
just simmering. When thus parboiled, dry it well and 
fill the three holes with nice stuffing, either sage, onion 
and bread crumbs made with equal proportions of boiled 
onions and crumbs, and chopped with ten large sage 
leaves to the pint, which must be dried till they powder, 
or highly seasoned veal-stuffing made as follows : 

" Veal - Stuffing. — Two ounces of beef suet, 
chopped very fine, four ounces of bread crumbs, one 
table-spoonful of chopped parsley, and half one each of 
thyme and marjoram, and the juice of half a lemon, 
half a tea-spoonful of salt, a pinch of pepper and a sus« 
picioD of nutmeg. 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 261 

" Fill the heart full of whichever of these stuffings is 
preferred, but do not press it in tight. Skewer over the 
top several thin slices of fat pork, dredge it with flour, 
and bake it one hour and a half in a good oven. Make 
gravy of a cup of good soup or broth, poured into the 
pan in which the heart was baked, and thickened with a 
tea-spoonful of brown thickening. Many people like 
red currant jelly made hot and served with it as sauce. 
The platter and plates naust be very hot and the heart 
covered as it goes to table. 

" The next day it can be warmed over by cutting it 
into slices and gently stewing it in a rich gravy. It is 
nicer than venison thus prepared." 

When Molly had this written in her book she opened 
the one Mrs. Welles handed to her and, to select from 
the many there, read, before copying, the recipes that 
would be most useful to herself and Mrs. Lennox. 

" I see you have preliminary remarks which will be 
valuable." 

" Yes, my mother's experience, not my own ; but she 
was a North-of-England woman and thought the London 
cured meat not worth eating." 

Under the head of general rules Molly read : 

Avoid salting meat in hot weather ; from October 
to April is the right season. If forced to do it, however, 
cut it up and sprinkle it with salt before the animal heat 
leaves it. If hung even for an hour, there is danger 
from flies. 

In cool weather, meat should hang three or four days 
to get tender before eating, but be very careful it does 
not become frost-bitten. In very cold weather, make 
the salt hot before using it. 

The great art in salting meat is to turn it every day 
carefully, rubbing salt under every flap or double part, 
and filling all holes with salt wherever a kernel has 
been cut out, or a skewer has been in. 

Use as little salt as will preserve the meat, as it will 
leave it more juicy and tender. Two ounces of bay salt, 
two of coarse sugar, and three quarters of a pound of 



262 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

common salt is a good proportion, and is enough for ten 
or twelve pounds of meat. Do not put on all the salt at 
once ; have it rolled and dried, and use half the first 
day, and the remainder two of three days after. Then 
the blood from the first saltiug must be drained off. 
Sugar preserves meat as well as salt ; hence its use, for 
it renders less salt necessary, and meat is more tender 
with it. Saltpetre is only useful for reddening meat, 
but is apt to harden it; if wanted red, however, take 
half an ounce of saltpetre and oue of coarse sugar; this 
must be rubbed in the third day after the first slight salt- 
ing ; the common and bay salt the next day. 

A small piece — eight or ten pounds — of pork or 
beef will require six or seven days ; a large piece may 
be allowed a fortnight. 

PiCKLixG MEAT. — Many prefer to boil the meat in 
water, instead of rubbing dry salt in. The proportions 
of this pickle are, two gallons of water, three pounds 
of salt, half a pound of coarse brown sugar, two ounces 
of saltpetre. Boil together and skim very well while 
boiling. Let it become quite cold before putting in the 
meat, which must be carefully wiped from slime or blood 
and any pipes or kernels removed. 

All meat, while salting, should be kept closely covered. 

Dutch beef. — Get a fine piece of round of beef; 
rub it well with one pound of coarse sugar. Do this 
twice a day for three days, using same sugar. When 
the sugar has throughly penetrated the meat, wipe dry, 
and salt with the following mixture : Common and bay 
salt, of each four ounces ; saltpetre and sal prunel, of 
each two ounces ; black pepper and allspice, of each one 
ounce. Rub well and continue to do so for a fortnight, 
then roll the beef tight in a cloth, sew it up, and it is 
ready for smoking. The smoking should be long enough 
to thoroughly and slowly dry the meat, but not long 
enough for the covering to separate. 

This beef may be cut and boiled as wanted. It should 
be pressed with a weight till cold. This will keep two 
or three months after it is boiled, if it is rubbed all over 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 263 

with hot fat (lard or suet melted), and a layer of fat put 
over a fresh-cut surface. This is delicious if a piece is 
cut off, put to dry slowly, and grated for sandwiches. 

Mutton HAMS. — Coarse sugar, bay salt, and com- 
mon salt, equal parts, aitd to each pound of this mixture 
add, of saltpetre and sal prunol, one ounce each, of black 
pepper, allspice, juniper berries, and coriander seeds, all 
bruised, half an ounce each. Dry them all before the 
fire, and rub into the meat while hot. This is an excel- 
lent pickle for tongues. Smoke as any other ham. 
Mutton hams are usually fried or broiled in rashers, or 
thin slices as you would pork ham. 

Worcestershire sausages. — These are made en- 
tirely of beef. Choose a fine, juicy round steak ; chop 
it extremely fine. Allow two parts lean, one part fat, 
and one part bread crumbs ; season pretty high with pep- 
per and salt (and allspice if liked). Allow to each 
pound eight sage leaves, dried and rubbed fine, with half 
a salt-spoonful of knotted marjoram. Put them in 
skins if you can, and cook as any other sausage. 

Red beef for slicing cold. — The best part for 
this purpose is the thin fiank. Take off the skinny in- 
side, and salt the meat for a week or ten days with the 
following mixture rubbed in and turn-ed morning and 
night : Common salt, one pound ; saltpetre and bay salt, 
each one ounce ; coarse brown sugar, a quarter of a 
pound. Pound and mix, using of the mixture more or 
less according to the size of the meat. When salt 
enough, wipe the meat dry ; sprinkle over it black pep- 
per, a little powdered mace and cloves, an onion chopped 
fine and some parsley. Roll it up, bind it tight with a 
strip of muslin, and boil it slowly three hours, or longer 
if large. Press with a heavy weight without removing 
the band. When cold remove the band and cut in very 
thin slices as required. 

" Well, I think now if Mrs. Lennox and I get meat in 
large quantities this winter, we shall not need to let any 
of it spoil for lack of ways to keep it," said Molly, as 
she prepared to copy the recipes she had read. 



264 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

" No ; but remember that mutton will keep for six 
weeks in cold, dry weather, even when not frozen, if it is 
well floured and a little ginger is put in the crevices. If 
it freezes and then thaws, it will generally need cooking, 
but the longer you can keep it the better it will be, so 
that it does not taint. The outer skin may even get 
mouldy, but you will only scrape the skin and trim it. 
If very mouldy and likely to give a taste, plunge it, after 
scraping, into boiling water ; dry it thoroughly and bake 
in a very sharp oven. But all meat for keeping must 
hang, not lie, and hang in a current oi pure air." 

" Thank you for the hint. What is this ? Soused 
mackerel ? " She had turned to the end of the note-book 
as she spoke. " I remember eating them at your house, 
and how good they were ; that recipe also is going down 
in my book." 

Soused mackerel. — Clean, but do not split, four 
or six fresh mackerel ; boil them in water just to cover, in 
which are one clove, three allspice, one tea-spoonful of 
salt and a quarter one of pepper to each fish. Take the 
fish out as soon as done, and before they break lay them 
in a deep dish. Boil the water in which they were 
cooked down to half; put to it an equal quantity of vin- 
egar (unless the latter is very strong, when one-third 
will do), and pour it over the fish. 

Soused mackerel another way — *' and that is 
the way I like best," said Mrs. Welles, and Molly read : 
Put three or four mackerel in an earthen dish, sprinkle 
over each mackerel a small tea-spoonful of salt, a sixth 
of pepper, and allow to each two allspice and half a 
blade of mace and half a bay leaf ; mix vinegar and 
water in equal proportion, and pour enough over to 
cover the fish; put them in a very slow oven for three 
or four hours. By that time the liquor will have di- 
minished until there is only enough to serve with the 
fish. These fish will keep for several weeks in cold 
weather. If the vinegar is very strong, use less in pro- 
portion. 

After luncheon, Mrs. Welles went to look at her 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 265 

muffins. They were hardly light, but the crumpets 
were so nearly ready that she put on the griddle. 

" You happen to have a soap-stone griddle ! that is 
the very thing needed for muffins, though one can man- 
age to bake on an iron one." 

"Yes, I am promising myself inodorous buckwheat 
cakes this winter with that." 

It took the griddle half an hour to get thoroughly 
hot. 

" Of course you have no crumpet-rings ? " 

"No; but if these are a success I shall get a few 
made ; meanwhile, won't muffin rings do ? They are the 
large, old-fashioned sort." 

" We must make them do ; but I can't bear anything 
not to look juat right. I never fancy they eat well if 
they do not." Molly handed out a bundle of large old 
rings which Mrs. Welles greased and laid on the grid- 
dle; then, when they were hot, she poured into each 
batter to the depth of a quarter of an inch, drawing the 
griddle a little back as she did so. She did not attempt 
to turn them until the top was full of holes and the bat- 
ter had dried ; then they were turned for about three 
minutes ; except that they were more slowly cooked, the 
baking was the same as for what are usually called 
raised muffins, and they appeared the same, but not quite 
so thick. They should not be more than half an inch 
thick when cooked. When they were done the muffins 
were ready to bake ; the paste was like honeycomb. 

" Now the whole difficulty with these is shaping them, 
and it requires practice. I don't know that I shall man- 
age it ; for it is years since I made them." 

The pastry-board was put on the table, a good deal of 
flour spread on it, and the paste turned out very gently. 

" You see, Molly, that the griddle is hot, yet not too 
hot." 

As she spoke she lightly cut off bits of the soft dough 
about the size of a duck's egg. She could not touch 
them easily, for they were too soft, but they were rolled 
about in the flour (taking care not to press them), which 



266 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH, 

was not worked into them, and they were left in a sort 
of bed of it. When half a dozen were done, she took 
one up very gingerly, tossing it gently back and forth 
between her floured hands, to get rid of the superfluous 
flour, and also because she could not let them remain in 
one position for fear of their sticking to her hands, yet 
so carefully as not to press the lightness out. When she 
reached the griddle she lightly dropped the muffin in as 
round a form as possible on it. When half a dozen 
were put on in the same way, they were left to swell 
and get round and dry-looking, before the griddle was 
put forward to give them a slight browning. When the 
top looked no longer raw, they were gently turned and 
left five minutes the other side. The baking took about 
twenty minutes, and they were over an inch thick when 
done. 

"I know one thing, — if /make these, I will have 
rings made four inches in diameter expressly for English 
mutfins, although I know the real ones are baked with- 
out rings. * It can't make much difference to the quality, 
and will save much trouble to unpracticed hands." 

" I think so too." 

There were a great many more muffins and crumpets 
than were likely to be used in their small family, and 
Molly said she should send some to Mrs. Lennox. 

" Then pray send the directions how to eat them, or 
they will simply put them in the oven, and they will be 
like leather. AVhen some people have offered me real 
English muffins, bought at Pursell's, with the crust like 
leather, I have been astonished that they could like 
them, and thought how they would enjoy them prepared 
in real English fashion." 

Molly penned a little note of directions as follows : 

Dear Mrs. Lennox : — I send you some English 
muffins and crumpets made by Mrs. Welles, who is anx- 
ious that you at least should eat them as they are eaten, 
in her country. She scouts the idea of their being simply 
made hot in the oven, and is only surprised that, eaten 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 267 

that way, they should be as much in favor as they are. 
Both are to be toasted, and are better the day after they 
are made. The crumpets are toasted both sides until 
hot through, slightly browner and crisp ; then butter, 
very little salted, must be plentifully laid in little bits 
on each one as it is toasted ; then put it in the oven 
while you toast the other. When the second is done, 
the butter on the first will be soft enough to spread 
without pressure. When all are buttered, cut once 
through the middle. 

The muffins are also toasted. They must be broken 
all round the edge as if you were going to split them, 
then toasted on hoch sides until the crust will crack under 
the thumb nail. Rip them open quickly, put a bounti- 
ful supply of butter, in small pieces, on the inside of 
each half ; close it and put it in the oven while another 
is being toasted. When it comes out the butter will be 
melted. Never attempt to spread them first, or they 
will be heavy. If the butter has not spread all over, 
you may gently use a knife to make it even, but without 
'pressure. AYhen each muffin is put together again, 
spread a little butter on the outer crust, and cut them 
through the middle. 

The essentials are that they should be well toasted, so 
as to be hot through and crisp outside, then so quickly 
buttered as not to get cold, and to be served very hot. 
There is a covered dish on purpose, called a muffineer, 
but lacking that, a hot bowl should be turned over them 
to keep them hot. 

It is English fashion, for tea, to serve both muffins and 
crumpets. They are handed round together, a plate of 
each, some preferring one, some the other. At breaks 
fast, muffins alone are usual. I just say the last to 
round up the matter, not that I suppose you will care 
one bit what the English mode of servi7ig is, but I do 
think, for the sake of our digestion, we should either eat 
them toasted or let them alone. I send you over my 
receipt-book, in which I have copied some things that 
may be useful to both of us. You tell me Mr. Lennox 



268 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

writes out such things for you, and you can keep the 
book until he has leisure. Yours sincerely, 

Molly Bishop. 

The pork hocks had been put on early for the mock 
brawn, and taken out and boned. The stock was now 
made, and Molly seasoned and prepared it in accordance 
with her plan. The pieces of pork, the seasoning, and 
the best of the beef, cut into pieces about two inches 
square, and of which there was about twice as much as 
there was pork, were put into the liquor, heated once to- 
gether, and then poured into a pan. It looked rather 
like head cheese. When cold, it turned out in a slab. 
Part was sent to Mrs. Lennox with an explanation of 
what it was ; part to Mrs. Gibbs, with the rest of the 
meat made into the usual hash for her ; and the re- 
mainder was kept for home purposes, for both Mrs. 
Welles and Marta found it very relishing. 



CHAPTER XLL 

THE BABY — CONCLUSION. 

It is July, nearly a year after Mr. and Mrs. Bishop be- 
gan the experiment of keeping house in Mrs. Winfield's 
cottage, which has become very dear to them both, al- 
though in three months they are to leave it and go into 
one of their own. So charmed had Mr. Bishop, senior, 
become with Harry's home that he had been a frequent 
visitor during the summer, and sometimes Mrs. Bishop, 
too, came; but society engagements took her time, and 
when May came, she fled with her daughters to a fash- 
ionable watering-place, and Mr. Bishop, instead of stay- 
ing as usual in his city house, came out to stay with his 
son, and went in with him to business daily. The result 
was that Harry was reinstated in his father's favor, and 
it seemed as if the elder gentleman was going to make 
amends for his past mistake ; for he told Harry he would 
now do what he always had meant to do until he found 
he was bent on making a fool of himself. 

" Not that your luck is anything to your credit," he 
persisted ; " it 's a mere fluke your getting such a wife as 
Molly ; but you'll come into the firm as junior at Christ- 
mas." 

This was what Harry had been brought up to expect, 
and the prospect that he had to give up on marrying 
Molly. He was grateful to his father, for after all, 
pleasant as life was for him even with his narrow in- 
come, it was likely to be a great deal pleasanter when 
he would not have to count every cent so closely. 

"Yes, yes, you are one who has the luck to * eat his 
cake and have it too,' " said the old gentleman irritably ; 
" but I 'm doing it just as much for Molly and the baby 
as for you." 



270 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

Yes, there was a baby, — a baby juf^t thirty-six hours 
old wheu Mr. Bishop annoimced his intention to the 
young father ; and Harry carried back to Molly that 
evening a very glad heart. The baby was a girl, and 
Molly's only shadow was that Harry did not seem to 
admire it so much as she thought it deserved. 

" You mean to say you don't think it 's pretty, Harry ? " 
she had asked when she exhibited the little red, squirm- 
ing thing in its nest of flannel. 

Harry shook his head doubtfully. " I may see some 
beauty later wheu, when it gets into some sort of shape, 
audits head is screwed tighter; at present I don't ad- 
mire it, but, as Mark Twain says, ' I 've a certain respect 
for it, for its father's sake.' " 

"Oh, Harry!" 

This was in the morning before he left home, and when 
he returned at night he went up to Molly's room and 
kissed her. He thought she must certainly see the good 
news in his face, so accustomed was he to her reading 
his countenance. 

" Well, Molly, don't you want to know the news ?" 

" But you have n't asked after the baby ; — don't you 
want to kiss it ? " 

" My dear Molly, your serenity told me how the baby 
was, — and — and I would n't disturb it to kiss it." 

*' You never saw such a sleeper as she is ; she won't 
wake, and I've hardly seen her eyes yet ! " 

" I hope she '11 continue such good habits ; but now, 
Molly, I have great news — news I expected some time, 
of course, but not quite so soon." 

Then he told the news, and Molly responded only by 
a closer pressure of his hand. 

" And that is not all ; my father has decided to buy 
the Framley cottage and rent it to us, and says he meant 
to give my wife a check as a wedding present, had I 
married M-iss Vanderpool, and now he sends it to you." 

" Oil, Hnrry, how good of him ! how much is it ? 
That sounds greedy ; but if it is enough we can furnish 
with it." 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 271 

Harry opened his pocketbook and took out a check for 
$1,000. *' You must lay this by, Molly, for yourself; 
you know I have $3,000 which we agreed never to touch 
except for some emergency ; but now that my prospects 
are assured I prefer to furnish for you, Molly, rather 
than you for me." 

" What will be your income, Harry ? " 

"Oh, nothing very splendid, for I am only junior with 
a fifth interest, but it is the certainty of the future 
that delights me." 

" Yes, and the proof of your father's affection." 

" Yes, certainly." 

" You remember, Harry, what we promised each other, 
— that even with a better income our expenses were not 
to be increased ? " 

" Not while I was on a salary, dear ; but I am quite 
contented with the last year of our life ; I want nothing 
grander or better, but I do want to see you in your own 
house furnished with your own taste, and replete with 
all the conveniences that will make the housekeeping you 
love, easy to you ; and I shall insist on providing you 
with such assistance as will save your health and strength. 
But I am not anxious for style or show, and we will 
waste no money upon it." 

Nor did they. 

Mr. Framley had built one of the handsomest houses 
in Greenfield, and the charming Queen Anne cottage 
they had hitherto lived in had been for sale. Molly had 
often pointed it out to her father-in-law and admired its 
beautiful lawn and expatiated on the fruits and kitchen 
garden, little supposing it would soon be her own home. 

The only crumple in Molly's rose leaves was Mrs. 
Bishop, senior's, views with regard to the baby. Molly 
had had no babies : her mother-in-law had had eight, five of 
whom had lived and flourished. But Molly had known 
other people's babies, and had made their experience her 
own, so far as observation enabled her to do it, and she 
had read all the good writing there was on the baby 
question, and, as may be expected, had her views and 



272 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

naturally wished to carry them out in the person of her 
own baby. If a woman can't do what she likes with her 
own baby, when is she to do it ? 

But, strange to say, the dowager, Mrs. Bishop, seemed 
to feel the new comer was even more Harry's baby and 
her own grandchild than Molly's child, and being her 
first "posterity," she was very much interested in it, and 
she and Mr. Bishop had come to the Greenfield hotel in 
order to be at hand. 

Very soon Molly, with her latter-day views of baby 
training, and Mrs. Bishop, with her experience of eight, 
clashed. For days the struggle was silent, for she was 
Harry's mother ; and all the directions for giving anise- 
seed tea, and gin and water, and paregoric, were quietly 
disregarded, — but the tug of war came when Molly re. 
fused to nurse it before the appointed hour. 

" And you mean to say you will not feed that little 
creature till the time you think it needs it ? Can you 
judge of a baby's hunger?" 

" Mamma, I asked the doctor to guide me, and all the 
best writers say " — 

" There it is ! " cried Mrs. Bishop, triumphantly. 
" You are such a theorist, Molly ; but you can't bring 
up a child by books, and it may cost you this one's life or 
health to find that out. I am surprised a woman of 
your sense should not see that you can't set up your 
book experience against the practical knowledge of a 
mother of eight." 

Molly made no reply : she could not be cruel enough 
to hint that three of the eight had died. 

Happily for Molly and the carrying out of her views, 
Mrs. Lennox, who had become a very dear friend, was 
with her very much, and it was her nurse, an intelligent 
woman, who was in attendance ; and between them they 
had been able to save Molly much anxiety. She knew 
that her own orders, and no one's else, would be carried 
out; this otherwise would have been a terrible anxiety; 
for her doctor had said to her, in one of her talks with 
him before the birth of the child, " Half the babies' stom« 



TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 273 

achs are ruined in the first month, and the poor baby be- 
comes a victim to colic and indigestion through that 
month's mistakes. Some babies are born to it, but these 
are few compared with the many that are made to suffer 
by bad habits." 

Mrs. Bishop, senior, disapproved of the nurse, and 
openly derided the doctor, and audibly scorned the idea 
of putting a baby a fortnight old in "training" and 
freely told her daughter that Molly was not fit to be a 
mother ; that she ought to have remained single and be- 
come a doctress, or, screeched for woman's rights from a 
platform. 

The excitement of the contention on Molly had to be 
stopped, and, unknown to his wife, Harry, instigated by 
Mrs. Lennox, had to warn his mother that she must 
leave Molly to her own ideas, even if they were mis- 
taken ; and Mrs. Bishop had contented herself after- 
wards with expressing her opinions and her fears. But 
when, in spite of all, the baby flourished and grew fat, 
and seemed freer from the ills of babyhood than the 
average, she averred it was owing to the cast-iron con- 
stitution it had inherited from its father. She declared 
that " to point to Molly's child as a proof that the new 
ideas of bringing up babies are better than the old is as 
reasonable as to point to the health and strength of the 
Germans as a proof that babies ought to be swaddled 
and bound on to boards for the first months of their 
lives, in order to become so strong and straight. One 
forgets the number who die under the process, and it is 
only the very strong who survive." 

And this, strangely enough, was exactly what Molly 
also said to herself when she heard that Harry " actually 
owed his life to soothing syrup," which had enabled him 
to survive his teething troubles. 

And so with a beautiful, healthy baby (whom, by the 
bye, Harry now dandles with great pride), a new house, 
anil the delightful task of furnishing it, in these days of 
pretty furniture and dainty devices, we leave Molly 
with as bright a future before her as a loving husband,

good health, good prospects and a resolve to be a good, 
true wife and mother could give to any woman. 

Of Marta there are a few words to be said. Those of 
Molly's friends who are not very often at the house con- 
sider Mrs. Bishop a very fortunate woman in having 
such a treasure. Molly herself thinks so ; but I doubt 
if half those who so speak would have been satisfied 
with Marta's moderate gifts. She was a treasure be- 
cause she was true and faithful in everything. Her 
service was not better than that of any clean, strong, 
willing girl, under the eye of an intelligent mistress. 

'•But Marta was such a wonderful cook!" some 
would say. Marta would never be a good cook un- 
guided ; it was not in her ; she had had the exceptional 
advantaoje of trainins: under a woman who, if she had 
needed it, had qualified herself to teach cooking profes- 
sionally ; who cooked scientifically from precise rules, 
and who herself had very little to learn when she began 
with Marta, and who had patience as well as knowledge. 

How few girls have such a chance ! We send girls to 
a cooking-school to take twelve or twenty-four lessons, 
and we know that if they are of the right material (and 
if not we should hardly send them), they leave the 
school vastly improved, with quite different ideas from 
those who have been through no such training; and 
Marta had been at such a school daily for many months, 
yet, at the end of them, her accomplishments were not 
many. She could fry, stew, roast, and make soup to 
perfection. She could not be trusted to do anything 
that depended on flavor or taste; she never seemed to 
learn that one clove may be pleasant, half a dozen detest- 
able ; that herbs should only lend a vague savoriness, 
never be so strong as to make one feel they were par- 
taking of marjoram soup or parsley stew. But Molly 
knew her limitations and knew — take her all in all — 
she was not likely to better herself by changing. A 
girl of quicker wits might have been less faithful, or, if 
so bright as to learn all Molly could teach, she would 
naturally and rightly wish to take a place as professed

cook, with her thirty or forty dollars a month wages, and 
no washing. So Marta remained, a very devoted ser- 
vant ; very exasperating sometimes, but at all times 
valuable. 

Mrs. Lennox has only one thing to say ; she does not 
regret taking Maggie ; she is no worse off in her pocket, 
and is better off in nerves and muscles ; the tired, over- 
worked look is no longer conspicuous. She is still over- 
worked and overworried, but she has a strong pair of 
arms to call upon, and they are willing to do the ap- 
pointed task which Mrs. Lennox always remembers she 
must otherwise have done herself. Maggie needed 
watching at every turn the first few months ; she now 
knows the ways and does the work fairly well. She is 
no paragon, and if Mrs. Lennox had no children she 
would rather be without her, but when she gets out of 
patience she looks back and remembers how she had 
not even time " to think " before she came ; when she 
did sit down her muscles ached and tingled so that even 
rest was a dull void, simply cessation from exertion. 
Mrs. Lennox now does the cooking and the sewing ; 
Maggie does the work. She will never do more in the 
cooking way than boil potatoes, make mush and bread 
(the latter well, for she knows only one way and that is 
the way she does it), and burn or smoke a beefsteak. 
But Mrs. Lennox will soon have either to pay her more, 
or take another new arrival ; that is inevitable. 

It must not be thought that all Molly's neighbors were 
as fond of her as Mrs. Lennox. No one can live up to 
a higher ideal than the average (even when the ideal is 
only cooking), without hurting some one's corns. 
Several ladies disapproved of her, thought she set a 
very bad example by making men expect too much of 
their wives, and those who lived very badly on double 
Harry's income felt personally injured. 

But all this Molly did not know ; she did not suspect 
that her affairs were known or discussed, but before 
leaving Greenfield Mrs. Winfieid had spoken, with the 
best intentions in the world, of this young couple's ro- 



276 TEN DOLLARS ENOUGH. 

mantic marriage, and the bravery required of a young 
wife to face life on $100 a month, with a husband 
brought up, as Harry had been, in such splendor and lux- 
ury. This was naturally discussed till the story became 
public property, unknov/n to the heroine of it, who had 
no thought of setting an example, good or bad, or of 
shining brightly by comparison with less clever or en- 
ergetic women ; indeed, she was rather conscious of short- 
comings of her own. She looked hopelessly on the piles 
of sewing some of her friends got through, with very 
many calls on their time besides, and could only comfort 
herself with the thought that her abilities did not lie in 
that direction, and that she could only do the best that 
was in her. 

Another pleasure in store for Molly is that Mrs. 
Welles is soon to be her neighbor ; for Mr. Welles had 
promised to build a house near them, in consequence of 
which Harry predicts that Greenfield will soon have a 
rival to Soyer's celebrated symposium.
