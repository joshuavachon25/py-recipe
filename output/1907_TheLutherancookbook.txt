INTRODUCTION 



1|The wide-spread popularity of former editions of this 
book, and a growing demand for practical recipes which 
stick to one's ribs, is our apology for this one. 

•The recipes in this book are gathered from many sources; 
some of them are old, some are new, all, we believe, 
are good. 

llThis, the fourth edition, is revised, enlarged, and in 
part rewritten. 

1|In submitting it to the progressive housewife our aim is 
to provide her with a cook-book in the careful, intelligent 
use of which she will be able to set her table appetiz- 
ingly and, at the same time, economically.

Meat and E££s 



Beefsteak Roll. — Cut a slice from the round weighing 
two pounds and about one inch thick. Cut one slice of fat 
salt pork into small pieces or cubes. Lay the meat on a 
board, sprinkle the pork over and roll up tight; tie a stout 
thread round in several places and steam three hours. From 
the liquid in the dish in which the meat was placed make 
a gravy, using brown flour for thickening". Serve with 
baked potatoes. 

Veal Cutlets, German Style. — Two pounds of veal cut- 
lets, one egg, beaten light, two teaspoonfuls of melted but- 
ter, pinch of pepper, salt to taste. Cut the veal cutlets into 
neat pieces, about the size of a silver dollar, pepper and salt 
lightly, dip each piece into the beaten egg and melted but- 
ter, and fry ten minutes in a little butter or good dripping. 
They should be a nice brown on each side. Put in a plat- 
ter and pour tomato sauce over them. 

A Pot Roast. — Use for this a portion of the brisket, 
which is one of the cheapest cuts of meat. To prepare, 
place in a pot without water, and stir about over the fire 
till well browned, after which add boiling water nearly 
sufficient to cover the meat. Boil slowly till done, allow- 
ing twenty minutes to a pound, adding when half done the 
salt. Half an hour before done, pare a few potatoes, and 
place them under the meat. When ready to take from the 
fire, thicken with flour, adding curry at the same time if 
desired. If properly cooked, the meat will be tender and 
the gravy rich and free from grease and lumps. — The Luth- 
eran ( )bserver. 

Baked Ham. — Ham intended for boiling should be thor- 
oughly washed, rubbing with a coarse cloth. Put into a 
large vessel, so that it may be covered with cold water. 
If large, boil about fifteen minutes for each pound of ham. 

5 



When done, remove from the fire and let cool. Remove the 
skin and spread over the top a mixture made as follows : 
( >ne tablespoonful of mustard, one-half tablespoonful black 
pepper, and two teaspponfuls of brown sugar. Lay the 
ham in a pan and pour mixture over it. Bake, basting fre- 
quently. 

Meat Cakes. — Take raw beef, and with chopper cut 
finely, as for sausage meat. Season with pepper and salt, 
and if desired, a little raw onion, but this must be cut very 
finely. Shape into balls like sausage meat, and fry in hot 
fat, as one would doughnuts. Care must be taken that the 
meat is well cooked. — Mrs. O. H. Melchor, Springtown, 
Pa. 

Veal Croquetts. — Chop fine cold cooked veal ; add one- 
third as much mashed potatoes, and one-half onion, chop- 
ped fine ; salt and pepper to taste. Mix with egg, then make 
into small cakes; dip in beaten egg, and roll in cracker 
dust, and fry in boiling lard. — Mrs. Geo. Geiss, Allentown, 
Pa. 

Hash. — Cut fine any cold beef that may be left from 
a meal, 2 onions, 4 large potatoes. Amount of onions and 
potatoes must be increased or diminished according to 
amount of meat used. After making a gravy of I table- 
spoonful of lard and two tablespoonfuls of flour, add two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar; then stir in the meat, onions. 
potatoes and a little parslev cut fine ; boil about fifteen min- 
utes.— Mrs. L. B. Hafer, Philadelphia, Pa. 

Hamburg Steak. — One-half pound lean, raw beef chop- 
ped fine, season with onion, salt and pepper. Shape into 
small flat balls, using but little pressure. Put into frying 
pan a small piece of butter, and when hot put in steak. 
Turn frequently. A little chopped salt pork is an improve- 
ment. * 

Veal Loaf. — Two pounds ground veal or beef, one-half 
cup cracker crumbs, two eggs, one-half cup rich cream, 
butter size of an egg and parsley, salt and pepper to suit 
taste. Mix all together and roll in cracker crumbs. Put in 
pan with little water. Cover and bake till the juice comes 

6 



out on top. This can be served warm or cold. — Miss Emma 
Senseman, New Kingston, Pa. 

Beef Juice. — Take fresh, juicy beef, remove all fat and 
skin and cut in half inch blocks. Place pan on stove, when 
hot put in a little of the meat at a time, turning pan from 
side to side until it turns white (do not fry), remove from 
pan and put into beef press and squeeze all the juice from 
it. Serve with cracked ice and salt to taste. 

Ham Toast. — Toast as many slices of bread as there 
are people to serve. For each slice allow the yolk of one 
egg beaten, a spoonful of milk and a rounding tablespoon- 
ful of minced cold boiled ham. Let the ham heat through 
and the eggs curdle, but not harden and spread on the toast 
at once. If the mixture boils it will be spoiled. 

Beef Loaf. — Two pounds of beef steak ground fine, one 
cup cracker crumbs, one-half cup melted butter, two eggs, 
one cup sweet milk (hot) salt and pepper to taste. Water 
may be used instead of milk. Mix well together and form 
into a loaf. Bake about two hours, basting with water 
while baking. — Mrs. Charles Hetrick, New Kingston, Pa. 

Veal Loaf. — Select a knuckle of veal, or any bony piece 
that has a large proportion of gelatine. Cut in small pieces, 
and remove any fragments of bone. Cover with cold water, 
boil quickly, skim and add one onion, one teaspoon of salt, 
and one saltspoon of pepper. Let it simmer until the meat 
slips from the bone, the gristly portions are dissolved, and 
the liquor reduced to one cup. Remove the meat, pick out 
all the bones, strain the liquor and season highly with salt, 
lemon juice and pepper, and slightly with sage or thyme. 
Chop or pick the meat apart ; add two or three tablespoons 
of powdered cracker and the meat liquor; mix well and put 
into a bread pan. Put it in a cool place and when hard, 
serve in thin slices. The gelatine in the meat liquor will 
harden and hold the meat together without pressure. Serve 
in slices daintily garnished. — This is Mrs. Lincoln's Recipe. 

Stuffed Beefsteak. — Take a round <A beef steak, salt 
and pepper. Make a dressing of bread crumbs and parsley; 
butter same as for chicken, and lay in the steak; tie up 



and put in pan to roast. Lay a slice of fat salt pork on 
top, and baste often. 

Savory Meat. — Three and one-half pounds raw lean 
beef from the round, chopped fine, six soda chackers rolled, 
three eggs not beaten (just mixed), one tablespoon salt, 
one tablespoon pepper, one nutmeg, four tablespoons cream, 
one spoon water, small piece butter, one teaspoon parsley. 
Bake in oven one and one-half hours, basting with butter 
and water. 

Deviled Ham Sandwich. — Chop cold boiled ham very 
fine. For each teacupful take the yolks of two hard boiled 
eggs, one-half teaspoonfnl of mustard, and half cup of 
nulled butter, some salt and pepper to taste. A little chop- 
ped pickle gives it a good taste. Spread between slices of 
bread. 

Veal Steak. — If it is necessary to wash the veal, wipe 
dry. Dip in beaten egg, then into cracker crumbs, and fry 
in half butter and lard to a nice brown. Season with pep- 
per and salt in the pan. 

Veal Loaf. — Three pounds veal, one-quarter pound 
pork, two eggs, five crackers crumbed, one-half cup milk. 
Bake one and one-half to two hours. — Mrs. James H. 
Moore, Newark, Ohio. 

Sandwich Filling. — Boil pork tenderloin until tender, 
well seasoned with salt and pepper, grind, mix with chop- 
ped nuts and mayonnaise. Spread between thin slices of 
bread with or without a lettuce leaf. — Mrs. F. D. Altman, 
Atchison, Kansas. 

Panned Beef. — Use nice, tender steak ; have pan hot 
and put meat in. Let be a moment and turn ; keep turning 
from side to side until done; the quicker it can be browned 
the better. Pepper and salt to taste, and spread plenty of 
butter on both sides. Serve at once. 

Roasted Beef. — To roast beef properly, it should be 
boned, rolled together and secured by skewers. Prepared 
in this way, a roast of four or six pounds will answer a 
small family for several meals, as it can be nicely re-roast- 
ed the see- »n d day. Place it in a roaster, dredged with salt, 
pepper and flour; add boiling water, and roast for two 

8 



hours. Longer time is required if the meat is desired 
well done. 

To Cook Sweetbreads. — Having sealded in salted 
water, remove stringy parts. Then stand them in cold 
water ten minutes. Drain on towel. Dip into egg and 
bread crumbs, and fry in butter. 

Baked Eggs. — Break eight eggs into a well buttered 
dish, put in pepper and salt, bits of butter, and three table- 
spoons cream. Set in the water 5 minutes, or set in oven 
and bake twenty minutes. 

Dutch Dish. — To one pound of veal or fish remnants, 
add a fourth of a pound of bread that has been moistened 
with beef tea, one finely ehoped onion, one-fourth each of 
salt and ground cloves, three tablespoonfuls of melted but- 
ter, one-half a lemon peel grated, and the well beaten yolks 
of three eggs. When these are mixed, put the stiffly beaten 
whites of the eggs into the mixture, pour into a buttered 
baking dish and bake three-quarters of an hour. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Beat together eight eggs, add pep- 
per and salt to taste, 1 pint of milk, then pour in a hot pan 
that has one tablespoonful of hot lard in it. Fry until it 
can be taken from pan on a cake turner. — Mrs. M. E. Ridg-

of Hour, a pinch of salt. Beat whites and yelks separately. 
Have a buttered pan very hot. Bake in quick oven five 
minutes.

eggs about fifteen or twenty minutes. Shell and cut off 
a little white so the egg will stand up alone. Boil one

yelks and sprinkle over top. Serve hot. — Mrs. John D. 

Lippy.

large quantity of water for twenty-four hours, then trim 
and scrape very clean; put into large stewpan, with more 
than sufficient water to cover it; put in mace, cloves, thyme 
and bay leaves. Boil four or five hours, according to 
weight : when done, let it become cold in liquor in which 
it was boiled. Then remove rind carefully, without injur- 
ing the fat ; press cloth over it to absorb as much of the 
greese as possible. It is always improved by setting in 
the oven for nearly an hour, till much of the fat dries out, 
and it also makes it more tender. Shake some bread rasp- 
ings over the fat. Serve cold garnished with parsley. 

Fried Salt Pork. — Cut fat salt pork in thin slices and 
soak in milk for a few hours. Pour boiling water over, 
drain and fry until crisp. When partly fried they may

oven, adding more water as necessary. 

Liver and Bacon. — Cut liver in one-half in. slices, soak 
in cold water 20 minutes, drain, dry and roll in flour. Have

transfer to hot platter. Fry liver quickly in the hot fat, 
turning often. When done pour off all but one or two 
tablespoons fat, dredge in flour until it is absorbed, and 
stir till brown. Add hot water gradually to make smooth 
gravy, season and boil one minute. Serve separately. 

Few people know that lamb's liver is as tender and 
well flavored as calf's liver; it is much less expensive. 

Stew, Irish. — Time, about two hours. Two and one- 
half pounds chops, eight potatoes, four turnips, four small 
onions, nearly a quart of water. Take some chops from 
l<»in of mutton, place them in a stewpan in alternate layers 
of sliced potatoes and chops ; add turnips and onions cut

pan closely, let stew gently till vegetables are ready to 
mash and greater part of gravy is absorbed; then place in 
a dish ; serve it up hot.

Poultry and Game 



To Prepare a Fowl. — Wash the fowl thoroughly inside 
and out, to remove the oil, to which the dirt will adhere. 
Singe and put the bulk of the stuffing in the neck, after the 
crop has been removed. Truss the bird by pinning the 
wings closely with skewer, then tie the legs closely to the 
body with stout twine, and bind down the neck upon the 
back. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and lay strips of fat 
salt pork over the breast. Bake in a hot oven two hours, 
basting every fifteen minutes. — Lutheran Observer. 

Roast Chicken. — Clean well and wipe dry inside of 
fowl. Make filling as follows : Pour over stale bread 
enough milk to moisten well, add two eggs, beaten light, 
small lump of butter, a little onion, salt and pepper to taste. 
Fill chicken and bake, basting often with the water from 
the pan. Boil together the heart, liver and gizzard until 
tender. Chop very fine, put back in the water they were 
boiling in, pour into pan after chicken is removed, thicken 
with a little flour, salt ami pepper to taste. 

Chicken Mince. — Place two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and one of flour in the pan : when thoroughly absorbed and 
smooth add one cupful milk. When hot add two cupfuls 
of cold cooked chicken that has been cut into dice and 
stir well ; when quite hot add a seasoning of salt and at 
the last moment a dust of pepper. 

Baked Chicken. — Have the fowl prepared the after- 
noon before. Prepare a dressing as follows: One pint of 
corn meal, two eggs, two-thirds of a pint of sour milk, 
one-half teaspoonful of soda: mix well and steam or bake 
in oven. When done, soften with a little water. Add 
chopped onion and pepper to taste. Stuff uncooked chick-

batter of one quart of milk, three cups of flour, one-half 
cup of melted butter, two teaspoonfuls of Royal Baking

IN all receipts in this book calling for 
baking powder use " Royal." Better 
and finer food will be the result, and 
you will safeguard it against alum. 

In receipts calling for one teaspoonful of 
soda and two of cream of tartar, use two 
spoonfuls of Royal, and leave the cream of 
tartar and soda out. You get the better food 
and save much trouble and guess work. 

Look out for alum baking powders. Do 
not permit them to come into your house 
under any consideration. They add an in- 
jurious substance to your food, destroying 
in part its digestibility. All doctors will tell 
you this, and it is unquestionable. The use 
of alum in whiskey is absolutely prohibited ; 
why not equally protect the food of our 
women and children? 

Alum baking powders may be known by 
their price. Baking powders at a cent an 
ounce or ten or twenty-five cents a pound 
are made from alum. Avoid them. Use no 
baking powder unless the label shows it is 
made from cream of tartar.

two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one scant tablespoon of cin- 
namon, three cups of vinegar. Peal tomatoes and onions 
and chop or grind fine, boil one and one-half hours; bottle 
and seal.— Mrs. W. C. Garber, Andersonburg, Pa. 

Chow Chow. — Two good sized heads of cabbage, one- 
half peck green tomatoes, four sweet peppers, four bunches 
celery, one dozen onions, one ounce celery seed, one ounce 

66 



mustard seed, one and one-half pounds sugar, one and one- 
half quarts good cider vinegar. Chop cabbage, tomatoes, 
onions and peppers, and add three-fourths cup of salt. Mix 
well and let stand over night. Then press dry and add 
celery chopped tine, vinegar, sugar and seeds, and cook 
until soft (about one and one-half to two hours.) Then 
place in air tight jars. If too dry, add more vinegar and 
sugar to taste. — Mrs. Chas. Hetrick. 

Tomato Catsup. — Boil tomatoes and run through col- 
ander. After boiling eight quarts of juice to one-half, add 
one tablespoonful salt, one teaspoonful red pepper, one 
teaspoonful cinnamon, one teaspoonfnl cloves, one cup 
sugar, one quart of vinegar. — Mrs. J. \\ . Weeter. 

Pickled Cauliflower. — Strip off the leaves, divide the 
stalks, scald them in salt water and dry on a sieve. Cut 
them into small pieces, put them in a jar and cover with 
boiling vinegar. Make a spice-bag according to the direc- 
tions given for the tomato pickles and add to the cauli- 
flower. — Lutheran Observer. 

Sweet Pickle Pears. — 'Boil nine pounds of pears until 
they are tender, then make a syrup of three pounds of 
sugar and one pint of vinegar and boil the pears in it until 
they are very rich. Add two teaspoon fuls of essence of 
cinnamon. 

Sweet Pickle Peaches. — Make a syrup of one pound 
sugar and one pint of vinegar. Add two tablespoonfuls of 
cloves and one tablespoonful of mace, and cook the peaches 
in it until tender. Let them stand over night, then heat the 
syrup and pour it boiling hot over the fruit. Put it up air- 
tight. — Lutheran ( )bserver. 

Spiced Tomatoes. — Steep together four pounds of 
sugar and two quarts of vinegar, add three pounds of to- 
matoes and boil for three hours. Add salt and pepper to 
taste, and flavor with cloves and cinnamon. — Lutheran Ob- 
server. 

Tomato Pickles. — Chop fine twelve quarts of green to- 
matoes, put them in a colander and let them stand all night 
t<> drain. In the morning chop six or seven green peppers 
and add them to the tomatoes, with a cup of whole mustard 

67 



seed. Make a spice-bag containing one-half cup of cinna- 
mon and cloves in equal proportions, put it in with other 
ingredients and cover the whole with boiling vinegar. — 
Lutheran < )bserver. 

Small Cucumber Fickles. — Wipe the cucumbers, pack 
them down in a stone jar. Make a brine of salt and water 
sufficient to bear an egg, pour this over the pickles and 
let it stand twenty-four hours. Drain and arrange them 
neatly in jars. Between each layer put a slice of onion, 
about a teaspoonful of mustard seed, three or four cloves, 
and the same of allspice, and a few bits of horseradish; so 
continue until the jars are full. Fill the jars with boiling 
cider vinegar and steam for twelve minutes. Screw on 
tops just as you would for fruit. 

Sweet Pickles. — This recipe will answer for peaches, 
pears, canteloupe and watermelon rind. 

Pare and weigh the fruit; to each seven pounds of fruit 
allow three pounds of sugar and a pint of vinegar, measure 
one teaspoonful of ground cloves, a teaspoonful of allspice, 
two teaspoonfuls of cinnamon, a half teaspoonful of mace 
and a grated nutmeg; mix all together, divide in four por- 
tions, and tie loosely in a square of cheese cloth. Throw 
these bags into the boiling sugar and vinegar, bring to a 
boiling point, and skim. Xow add the fruit, a little at a 
time, just enough to cover the bottom of the kettle; as the 
fruit begins to heat watch it carefully. When scalding hot 
lift it and put it in the jars. When the jars are full bring 
the liquor to boiling point, pour over the fruit, and steam 
for twelve minutes. 

Canned Mango Pickles. — Stuff your mangoes with the 
cabbage that has been seasoned to suit the taste. Let your 
mangoes stand in salted water over night, before stuffing 
them. When they are ready make a syrup of one quart of 
vinegar, one cup of sugar and a little horseradish root cut 
line ; few mixed spices. Boil, then pour over the mangoes. 
After they have been placed in the jars, seal tightly. Steam 
ten or fifteen minutes. They will keep good for a year. 
Excellent. 

Pickles. — Two quarts of tart apples, one pound of rai- 

68 



sins, three cupfuls of brown sugar, two cupfuls of lemon 

juice, one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, two quarts green 
tomatoes, one small onion, three cupfuls of vinegar, one- 
half cupful of salt, one ounce of ginger. Pare and core tin- 
apples and put through food chopper. Chop the tomatoes 
and onion in the same manner.- Stone the raisins. Mix tin- 
apples, tomatoes, raisins and onion with the other ingre- 
dients, and put away in an earthen jar over night, in the 
morning set the jar in a kettle of cold water. Let the water 
slowly heat. Steam six hours, stirring now and then. Put 
in preserve jars and seal. 

Chopped Pickles. — One-half peck of green tomatoes, 
one-half peck of small onions, one cupful of salt, three 
quarts of vinegar, two pounds of sugar, one-half pound of 
white mustard, two tablespoonfuls each of allspice, cloves, 
cinnamon, ginger and celery seed, one-half teaspoonful of 
red pepper. Slice and chop the onions and tomatoes, cover 
with the salt and let them stand over night. In the morn- 
ing drain thoroughly, put in a sauce pan, cover with one 
quart of the vinegar and boil fifteen minutes. Drain and 
put the sugar, mustard, pepper and spices in the remaining 
two quarts of vinegar over the fire. As soon as the vine- 
gar boils, add the chopped tomatoes and onions, and boil 
ten minutes. Take from the fire and put in glass jars 
while hot. The quantities given above will make six 
quarts.

Beverages 



Blackberry Cordial. — To one quart of blackberry juice, 
extracted by the fruit press, take two teaspoonfuls of 
ground cloves, one teaspoonful of mace, four teaspoonfuls 
ground cinnamon, one teaspoonful of allspice; one quart 
of syrup made as directed. Add the fruit juices and spices 
to the syrup and boil until a syrup is formed. Take from 
the fire and cool. When cool add one pint of brandy to 
every quart of fruit juice used; strain through a muslin 
bag, bottle and cork. 

Raspberry Shrub. — For every cupful of fruit juice take 
one-half cupful of cider vinegar and two cupfuls of sugar. 
Put the fruit juice, sugar and vinegar over the fire, stir 
until the sugar dissolves and boil to a thick syrup. Skim. 
if necessary, strain and bottle. 

All fruit juices are used in the same manner. When 
served, allow one-fourth cupful of syrup to three-fourths 
cupful of ice water. Should the syrup be too thin, do not 
adhere to this proportion of water. Taste is the best guide. 

Elder-blossom Wine. — One quart of elder berry blos- 
soms, nine pounds of sugar, one yeast cake, three gallons 
of water, three pounds of raisins, one-half cup of lemon 
juice. The blossom should he picked carefully from the 
stems and the quart measure packed full. Put the sugar 
and water together over the fire, stir until the sugar is 
dissolved, then let it come to a boil without stirring. Boil 
five minutes, skim and add the blossoms. As soon as the 
blossoms are well stirred in, take from the fire and cool. 
When lukewarm add the yeast dissolved in lukewarm water 
and the lemon juice. Put in an earthen jar and let stand 
six days, stirring thoroughly three times daily. The blos- 
soms must be stirred from the bottom of the jar each time, 
(hi the seventh day strain through a cloth and add the rai- 



.sins, seeded. Tut in glass preserve jars and cover tightly. 
Do not bottle until January. 

Hints on Making Good Coffee and Tea. — i. Never boil 
the water more than three or four minutes, longer boiling 
will cause it to lose most of its natural properties by evap- 
oration. 2. Water left in the tea-kettle over night must 
never be used in preparing the breakfast coffee or tea. 3. 
Be sure your coffee and tea are fresh. 

Coffee. — Take one even tablespoon of finely ground 
coffee for each cup needed. Scald coffee pot and put your 
coffee in percolator. Pour the boiling water over the coffee 
slowly. Close the pot closely and stand on back part of 
stove for thirty minutes. — Dr. G. F. Ritchey, New Kings- 
ton, Pa. 

Tea. — Use a brown earthen teapot, and dare to bring 
it to the table. Put your dry tea into this dry pot; cover it 
and iet It stand on the back of the stove until pot and tea are 
hot (this releases the aromatic oil of the leaves.) Now pour 
on the boiling water, as much as you want tea ; cover it 
closely, three teaspoons tea to two cups boiling water is 
about the right proportion of tea and water to be used. 
Never boil tea, black and green. Heat the leaves, steep in 
boiling water, and keep the steam in the pot and the tea 
will be excellent. Never use a metal teapot. Russian tea 
is made by putting a slice, of lemon in each cup and pour- 
ing over it the boiling tea. 

Iced Tea. — The tea should be made in the morning, 
very strong, and not allowed to steep long. Keep in the 
ice box till the meal is ready and then put in a small quan- 
tity of cracked ice. Do not pour the scalding hot tea on 
a goblet of ice as many do, for this spoils the tea. Iced 
coffee is very nice made in the same way. 

Grspe Juice. — One quart of grapes, one-half cup water. 
Put the grapes in the farina boiler with the water, which 
should be cold. Heat slowlv and cook at a low temperature 
until the grapes are soft. Put the grapes through the fruit 
press. Add to two cnpfuls of juice one-fourth of a cup of 
sugar and heat to just below boiling point. Do not let it 
boil, but keep it at a temperature of at least 200 degrees 

72 



Fahr. for one hour. Bottle and seal. When ready to use 
take one cup of syrup to a cup of cold water. Drinks 
should be chilled but not iced for an invalid. 

Chocolate. — Put two squares of chocolate, four level 
tablespoons of sugar and two tablespoons of water into 
a saucepan. When it is melted add two cups of water and 
boil five minutes, then add two cups of milk. Just as the 
chocolate is taken from the fire add a few drops of vanilla 
flavoring. Tour into cups and put a spoonful of whipped 
cream on each. 

Cocoa. — Put one quart of milk in a double boiler. 
.Moisten four tablespoons of cocoa with a little cold milk 
and add to the boiling milk stirring. all the while. Boil five 
minutes and ser\e hot with whipped cream. 

A Summer Draught. — The juice of one lemon, a tum- 
berful of cold water, pounded sugar to taste, half a small 
teaspoon of carbonate of soda. Squeeze the juice from the 
lemon ; strain and add it to the water, with sufficient pound- 
ed sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. When well mixed, 
put into the soda, stir well and drink while the mixture is 
in an efferversing state. 

An Inexpensive Drink. — ( )ne cupful pure cider vinegar, 
one-half cupful good molasses. Put into one quart pitcher 
of ice water. A tablespoon of ground ginger added makes 
a healthful drink. 

An Invalid Drink. — Put into the bottom of a wine glass 
two tablespoon I uls of grape juice, add to this the beaten 
white of an egg and a little chopped ice; sprinkle sugar 
over the top and serve. This is often served in sanitariums. 

Blackberry Wine. — Take ripe blackberries, pick out all 
imperfect ones and press out the juice through a course 
linen cloth; to each quart of juice add one quart of water 
in which is dissolved two pounds of white sugar; put into 
glass bottles or stone jugs and cover the mouths with 
any open or woven cloth, to admit air and keep 
out insects, set in cellar for six months, more or 
less; then pour off carefully from the lees into clean bottles 
and cork for use as wanted. 

Another. — Measure your berries, after picking them 

73 



over, bruise them, and to every gallon of berries add one 
quart of water, boiling hot. Let the mixture stand twenty- 
four hours, stirring occasionally; then strain off the liquor 
into a cask, for every gallon of juice adding two pounds 
of sugar. Cork tight and let stand till the following Oc- 
tober, when it will be ready for use without any further 
straining or boiling. . 

Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice from the lemons, cut 
them in small pieces and cover with sugar. Let stand at 
least an hour, then press out the juice the sugar has ex- 
tracted. The volatile, aromatic oil of lemons and oranges 
is in their skins, and twice as much lemonade of a better 
quality can be made in this way than by the use of juice 
alone. Boil one-half of a cup of sugar with one-fourth of a 
cup of water until it spins a light thread. Take from the 
fire, add one cup of lemon juice and the juice and sugar 
from the skins. Add water and sugar to taste and serve 
ice cold. 

Pineapple Lemonade. — One cup of sugar, one cupful 
of canned pineapple, one cup of water, juice of two lemons. 
Boil the sugar and water until it spins a light thread. Put 
the pineapple through the fruit press and add to the syrup 
with the juice of the lemons. When ready to serve, add 
water and sugar, if needed, to taste. Serve ice cold. 

Fruit Punch. — Two cupfuls of sugar, cne-half cup of 
orange juice, one cupful of strawberry juice, one cupful of 
water, one-half cup of lemon juice, one cupful of pineapple 
juice, one-half cup of Maraschino cherries. Boil the sugar 
and water to a syrup, and add the fruit juices. Let stand 
twenty minutes, strain and chill. Add the whole cherries. 
Sweeten or weaken, if necessary, to taste, and serve ice 
cold, ft will rarely need reducing with water unless the 
juices <;f preserved fruits have been used. 

Cherry Syrup. — Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, two 
cupfuls <»f cold water, two cupfuls of cherry juice. Stone 
the cherries. Dissolve the sugar in the water, add the cher- 
ries and their juice, and cook for ten minutes. Take from 
the fire and put through the press. Return to the fire and 

74 



boil until a thick syrup is formed. Seal when hot. Serve 
with shaved ice. thinning with cold water to taste. 

Mint Punch. — Remove the leaves from twelve large 
stalks of mint; chop them very fine; put them in a mortar 
with four or five tablespoonfuls of sugar and grind them 
to a paste. Or you may rub them in a bowl with a spoon! 
Boil together for five minutes a pound of sugar and a quart 
of water; add the juice of three lemons and the mint ; when 
the mixture is icy cold, freeze. This may stand four or five 
hours. Serve in punch glasses. 

Nasturtium Punch. — Chop line twenty-four nasturtium 
ilowers; rub them with a little sugar to a paste. Boil to- 
gether a pound of sugar and a quart of water for five min- 
utes; take from the lire, and add the juice of three lemons 
and the nasturtium flowers. Let these .stand until perfectly 
cold; add four tablespoonfuls of claret or grape juice. 
Freeze the mixture and serve in punch glasses. Especially 
nice with mutton. 

A nasturtium flower on the top of each glass makes a 
very pretty garnish. 

Ginger Punch. — Boil a pound of sugar with a quart of 
water; add the juice af three lemons and when cold add 
four tablespoonfuls of the syrup from the preserved gin- 
ger, and a half cut) of the ginger chopped very fine. Freeze 
and serve with the meat course at dinner. If preserved 
ginger is not to be had. add a tablespoonful of ground 
Jamaica ginger to the sugar and water before they are 
boiled, then add the chopped candied ginger.

Fruits, Jellies, Preserves 



Canning and Preserving. — The disappointment that so 
many experience in preserving and canning fruit can be 
avoided, if care and knowledge of proper principles of 
science are observed. The scientific part consist in cooking 
the fruit to sterilize any germs, while the common sense 
part consist in excluding all outside air. Of course fruit 
as fresh as possible should be used, and such should be 
perfectly sound and not overripe. Overripe fruit lacks the 
fine flavor of other fruit. Pick the fruit very carefully, and 
if it is absolutely necessary, rinse it quickly by placing in 
a colander or fine wire basket and dipping in and out of 
cold, clear water. Drain thoroughly. The flavor in the 
fruit will be much finer if it is not washed. Do not waste 
time and money canning poor fruit. 

Heat both jars and covers, and make sure that your 
jars are perfect and your rubber bands new. It is safer 
not to depend on rubbers that have once been used. Glass 
jars are by far preferable to tin and are now cheap enough 
to be in reach of all. Canning differs from presen rng in 
the amount of sugar used. 

While canning docs not require the same length of 
time, all fruit must be thoroughly cooked, so that every 
portion of it is subjected to a degree of heat sufficient to 
destroy all germs in the fruit. P>ut overcooking should In- 
avoided in order to retain the fresh, natural flavor. The 
length of time required for canning varies according to the 
variety and condition of the fruit, but do not have your 
fruit spoil for want of sufficient cooking. 

Fruits that have been shipped a long distance, or have 
stood for some length of time after being picked, need 
longer cooking than the freshly gathered. 

77 



The most delicate fruits require fifteen minutes, and 
thirty minutes is not too long for most kinds. 

Sugar is not considered necessary to the preservation 
of fruit, but it is added to make it more palatable, to in- 
crease the specific gravity of the water or fruit juices, and 
therefore by an additional degree of heat destroy the germs 
more certainly, and accomplish sterilization of the fruit 
in much shorter time. The addition of sugar also pre- 
serves the shape of the fruit, abstracting the juices and 
hardening it, which prevents it from becoming soft and 
falling apart. 

Use only the best granulated sugar for preserving 
fruits. 

To all juicy fruits like berries, add the sugar, which 
has been heated in the oven, to the fruit when it boils. 

For peaches, pears and such fruits as contain much less 
juice, make a syrup by dissolving the sugar in water, a 
pint of sugar to a pint or a pint and a half of water, as 
the fruit seems to require. Cook the fruit in this until 
tender enough to pierce with a straw, but not long enough 
to lose its form or break. 

Be sure to fill the jar to the very brim. Then run the 
handle of a silver spoon around and down the sides to be 
sure all air is excluded. Wipe the juice ofT the top care- 
fully, adjust the band, and screw down tight. Do this as 
quickly as possible, and when the jars are cool, again screw 
down the top, to make sure it is air-tight. Never set jars 
in a draught of air after filling. Some housewives turn the 
jars upside down for several days, then examine for leak- 
ages, and if perfect put away. If the contents of a jar 
begin to "work," open at once, re-heat and can again, using 
a little more sugar. 

Many use this method of canning. All ripe, mellow 
fruit is placed at once in the jars. These are then set in 
a large boiler of warm water, with little blocks of wood or 
a board underneath. Make a syrup as follows: A cup of 
sugar to a quart of fruit for the tart fruits and less for the 
sub-acid, and from one to three cups of water, according to 
juiciness of the fruit. Set the lids on loosely, cover the 

78 



boiler closely and keep the water boiling from fifteen to 
thirty minutes, according to kind and quality of fruit. Then 
Screw down the lids at once and set the jars on a folded 
damp cloth, unless you do not need the boiler again ; in that 
ease you can let the jars cool in the water after sealing. 
Proceed same as with other process. 

The usual method of preserving is to use equal weights 
of fruit and sugar, and cook a sufficient length of time to 
keei) the fruit without being perfectly air-tight. 

Preserved fruits are very rich, and for economical rea- 
sons, at least, most persons prefer the canned fruits for 
daily use. But some fruits are very much more palatable 
when preserved with a less amount of sugar. As a general 
rule, however, cooks living along the Atlantic sea-board 
make their preserves of a more cloying sweetness than 
those housewives who live in the Mississippi Valley. It 
seems to be due to a difference to taste, but wherein this 
difference originated has never been explained. 

Keep the jars in a cool, dark closet, where there is 
ventilation from door and window. If you have no such 
closet, enclose each jar in a paper bag, which will effectual- 
ly exclude the light. — Lutheran ( )bserver. 

Delicious Dish of Peaches. — Cut peaches in half, stone 
and sprinkle sugar in the hollows. Rub a large tablespoon 
of butter into a pint of Hour sifted with a teaspoon of 
Royal Baking Powder and a half teaspoon of salt. Peat an 
egg very light, stir it into a scant cup of milk, mix gradu- 
ally with the prepared flour beating well at the last. Pour 
into a greased baking pan large enough to allow the fruit 
to spread out. and the batter to be about an inch thick. 
Pake for a half hour in a brisk oven. Serve with cream 
and sugar. 

Iced Grapes. — Dip whole bunches of selected grapes, 
first in the white of egg, then in powdered sugar, sift the 
sugar over them until all are thoroughly covered. Lay on 
wax paper until dry. 

Simple Rule for Jelly. — Crush raw fruit or berries, ami 
drain off the juice. To this juice take the same amount or 

79 



j 



measure of sugar, but do not combine them at once. Put 
the juice into a granite pan and place over the fire, mean- 
time take the sugar and put it in a dripping pan, and place 
in the oven. When the juice has boiled twenty minutes, 
take the sugar hot from the oven and put it into the fruit 
juice. Let the mixture boil up, just enough to melt the 
sugar. Skim it, and then strain into jelly glasses, and the 
arduous task is done. I will warrant a jelly that will be 
firm and beautiful in color, in texture and in taste. 

One important thing, however, I have not mentioned, 
and that is that fruit not very ripe should be used. A fruit 
a little under ripe is best, although I have made jelly that 
jellied all right of pretty ripe fruit; still for one who wants 
an absolute success, the under ripe is not only much easier 
to jelly, but is better flavored. — Lutheran Observer. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Select firm berries and re- 
move the hulls. To each pound of fruit add three-quarters 
of a pound of granulated sugar; mix with the berries and 
let them stand ten or fifteen minutes, or long enough to 
moisten the sugar, but not to soften berries. Put them in 
a granite or porcelain-lined sauce-pan and boil slowly five 
or ten minutes, or until the berries are softened. Do not 
stir them as that would break the berries, and do not boil 
long enough for them to lose their shape. Cook one pound 
of strawberries or quart only at a time. A larger quantity 
crushes by its own weight. A good method is to have two 
saucepans and two bowls, and leave the berries after being 
hulled on a separate dish until ready for use. Then put 
a quart at a time in a bowl, with sugar sprinkled through 
them. While one bowlful is being cooked, the bowl refilled 
and the glasses filled the other one is ready for use. In 
this way no time is lost. It is well to put strawberries in 
glasses. ^ One quart of berries will fill two half-pint tum- 
blers. Cover the top with paraffin. Paraffin can be ob- 
tained at any pharmacy. Place it in a small saucepan on 
the side of the range; it melts at a low degree of heat, and 
when the glass is filled with hot preserves wipe the glass 
close to the fruit to free it of syrup. Cover the top with a 
tablespoonful of liquid paraffin, do not move the jar until 

80 



it has set. This is a very easy and satisfactory way of seal- 
Lutheran ( )bserver. 

Strawberry Jam. — For each pound of fruit allow a 
pound of sugar. Mash the fruit in the kettle, boil hard for 
fifteen minutes, then add the sugar and boil for five min- 
utes. — Lutheran ( )bserver. 

Apple Butter. — Twelve gallons sweet fresh eider, six 
gallons apples, twenty pounds sugar. Boil eider until it can 
be thoroughly skimmed. Then add sugar and boil until 
the eider does not separate. — Mrs. Chas. Hetrick, New 
Kingston, Pa. 

Quince Honey. — Three pounds sugar, one-half pint of 
water, two cups grated quinces, alum large as a pea. Boil 
sugar until no scum rises. Add quince and boil twenty 
minutes. 

Pineapple Honey. — Three pounds granulated sugar, 
one pint water, a small lump of alum. Boil ten minutes. 
Put in two cups grated pineapple, then boil ten minutes, or 
until it jellies. 

To Preserve Fruit by Cold Process. — Pack fruit in jars 
or a vessel as closely as you can without injuring the fruit. 
Then take one two-ounce package of compound extract of 
salyx and fourteen pounds of granulated sugar. Dissolve 
extract of salyx and sugar in three and one-half gallons hot 
water. Let cool and strain through flannel cloth; then pour 
on enough liquid to cover the fruit. Three and one-half 
gallons of the liquid will cover about twelve and one-half 
gallons of fruit. For preserving beans, corn and pickles 
by this process, see under "Vegetables." For preserving 
tomatoes to a gallon of tomatoes add one-fourth pint of the 
prepared sugar salyx syrup. Then cook ten minutes or 
until well scalded through the can. — Mrs. 1 1. A. Cornman.

Candies 



Home-Made Candies. 

The cream which forms the basis of much candy is 
not difficult to make, but must be prepared with care, and 
if it is made successfully, be sure the rest of your candy 
will be good. A proper quantity of this fondant, or "cream," 
for the amateur to make at a time, is concocted by using 
two cupfuls granulated sugar, a level saltspoonful of cream 
of tartar and two-thirds of a cup of hot water. After al- 
lowing the sugar to dissolve, bring slowly to a boil, taking- 
care to wipe away the crystals which form, as granulation 
may take place. When a little of the mixture dropped in 
cold water will form into a ball, the pan must be instantly 
removed from the fire. Stand the pan in cold water until 
the finger can be placed in the mixture without burning. 
Then with a flat wooden paddle, beat and stir until the 
mass becomes a creamy consistency and white. Then 
knead like dough, till soft and smooth. Below we give a 
few varieties of candies that may be made from this cream. 
Cut fresh marshmallows in babes. Melt again some 
fondant, color it a delicate pink, violet or green with vege- 
table coloring, flavor with rose, violet or bitter almonds. 
Dip each half marshmallow in fondant and roll in grated 
cocoanut. 

For acorn creams, roll a bit of fondant in the shape of 
an acorn. Melt sweetened chocolate, dip each cream in it 
until the effect n\ an acorn cup is produced. 

Strawberries may be made of pink fondant, a cord 
covered with crystalized sugar being run through the 
berry and extending for the stem. Unless these arc- to be 
given to verv small children, an artificial calyx may be 
added to make the effect more real. Xuts may be chopped 

83 



fine and rolled in the fondant, citron may be added to it, 
dates may be stoned, the centre filled with the cream and 
the whole rolled in sugar; layers of fondant variously col- 
ored, and placed one upon the other, may be cut in squares 
or any shape desired. In fact, the possibilities are endless. 
Do not attempt unless you are adept, to make all your 
candy at once. ( Hherwise, you will not want to look at 
candy for months to come. — Lutheran Observer. 

Nougat.— Two cups granulated sugar, two large cups 
nuts; boil six tablespoonfuls water with sugar, as in boiled 
icing, until it spins a thread; one-half teaspoon vanilla; 
pour on a large platter and beat well; add nut kernels; 
cut in strips one-half inch thick. 

Candy. — To one pound confectionery sugar, take the 
white of one eg-g, one tablespoon cold water, beat light. 
Knead to the substance of a dough. Flavor with almond. 
Roll out and cut in squares and decorate with nuts. 

A very nice candy can be made by dividing this in three 
parts. Flavor with strawberry, vanilla and chocolate. Roll 
out and place layer on the other, and roll once lightly, then 
cut in squares. — Miss Emma Senseman. 

Saldic Taffy.— Two cups sugar, one cup water, one- 
fourth cup vinegar, one-half teaspoon of cream of tartar. 
No stirring allowed. Pour on a buttered pan and pull when 
cold enough. 

Taffy. — One pint New Orleans molasses, two civps 
sugar, one-half cup butter, one tablespoonful vinegar; stir 
to keep from burning; cook until brittle when put in ice 
water. — Mrs. Geo. I. Uhler. 

Molasses Candy. — Three cupfuls of brown sugar, one- 
half cupful of molasses, one cupful of water, one-half tea- 
spoonful of cream tartar, butter the size of a walnut. Bring: 
to a boil, and when crisp by testing in cold water, flavor; 
pour out on a buttered plate and pull to whiteness if de- 
sired. 

Butter Scotch. — Two cupfuls of sugar, two tablespoon- 
fuls of water, a piece of butter the size of an egg. Boil 
without stirring, until it hardens on a spoon. Pour out on 
buttered plates to cool. 

84 



Ice Cream Candy. — Take two cupfuls of granulated 
sugar, half a cupful of water, and add one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of cream tartar dissolved in a teaspoonful of boil- 
ing water. Put it in a porcelain kettle, and boil ten min- 
utes without stirring it. Drop a few drops into a saucer 
of cold water or on snow. If it becomes brittle, it is done; 
if not, boil till it is. Add a piece of butter halt" as large 
as an egg while it is on the fire, and stir it in. Pour in t< » 
a buttered tin, and set on iee or snow t<> cool enough to 
pull it white. Flavor with vanilla just before it is cool 
enough to pull. Work into strands and cut into stick-. 

Cream Candy. — One pound of white sugar, three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of lemon extract, one 
teaspoonful of cream tartar. Add a little water to moisten 
the sugar, and boil until brittle. Put in the extract, then 
turn quickly out on buttered plates. When cool, pull until 
white, and cut in squares. 

Cocoanut Candy. — Grate very fine a sound cocoanut, 
spread it on a dish, and let it dry naturally for three days, 
as it will not bear the heat of an oven, and is too oily for 
use when freshly broken. Pour ounces will be sufficient 
for a pound of sugar for most tastes, but more can be used 
at pleasure. To one pound of sugar, take one-half pint of 
water, a very little white n\ v^^. and then pour over the 
sugar; let it stand for a short time, then place over a very 
clear fire, and let it boil for a few minutes; then sel it one 
side until the scum is subsided, clear it oil, and boil the 
sugar until very thick; then strew in the nut, stir and mix 
it well, and do not quit for an instant until it is finished. 
The pan should not be placed on the tire, but over it. as 
the nut is liable to burn with too fierce a heat. 

Almond Candy. — Proceed in the same way as for 
cocoanut candy, bet the almonds be blanched and per- 
fectly dry, and (\i) not throw them into the sugar until 
they approach the candying point. 

Candied Nuts and Fruits. — Three cupfuls of sugar, one 
cupful of water: boil until it hardens when dropped in 
water, then flavor with lemon. It must not boil after the 
lemon is put in. Put a nut on the end of a tine knitting 

85 



needle, take out, and turn on the needle until it is cool. If 
the candy gets cold, set on the stove for a few minutes. 
Malaga grapes and oranges quartered, may be candied in 
the same way. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Two cupfuls of sugar, one cup- 
ful of warm water, one-half cupful of grated chocolate, 
three-fourths of a cupful of butter. Let it boil without 
stirring until it snaps in water. 

Ice Cream Candy. — Take three cupfuls of granulated 
sugar, one and one-half cupfuls cold water, one-fourth cup- 
ful vinegar, butter the size of a walnut, boil until it will 
harden in cold water, then flavor with vanilla, pour into 
pans that have been buttered well, then pull until firm and 
white. — Mrs. A. R. Longenecker. 

Creams. — Eighteen tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar, 
four tablespoonfuls of hot water; boil hard four minutes; 
flavor and set dish in cold water; stir until it is sugared 
enough to drop on buttered paper. Any kind of creams 
may be made from this — cocoanut, peppermint, lemon or 
any flavor. If this cools before one can drop it all, heat 
a little more; or, if not quite hard enough, boil a little 
more ; it does not spoil easily. — Miss Lotta B. Frankforter. 

Molasses Taffy. — One pint molasses (New Orleans), 
one cup sugar, two tablespoons melted butter, one table- 
spoon vinegar, Boil without stirring until it hardens in 
water. Add one teaspoon soda. Pour in buttered tins, 
when cold enough pull until brittle. 

Butter Taffy. — Boil three cups brown sugar, one-half 
cup molasses, one-fourth cup each hot water and vinegar. 
When it crisps in cold water, add two tablespoons butter, 
one teaspoon vanilla. Cook three minutes. Cool on butter- 
ed pans. — Miss Bessie Greenwood. 

Peanut Brittle. — Shell roasted peanuts to measure one 
pint. Put two pints granulated sugar on a pan, stir over 
slow fire. It will lump, then gradually melt. When clearly 
melted, add nuts and pour quickly on buttered tins as thin 
as possible. When cold break up.— Miss Emma Senseman. 

Salted Peanuts.— Take one pint of peanuts before they 
have been roasted, pour boiling water over them and re- 

86 



move the brown skin, spread on a plate to dry; take a lump 
of gutter size of hickorynut, put in pan and let melt; then 
pour peanuts in ; set in hot oven until they turn a light 
brown, stir occasionally; take from oven and sprinkle salt 
over them. — Mrs. S. F. Tholan. 

Pennsylvania Walnut Fudge. — Two cups sugar, one 
cup milk, one-half cup cocoa; butter one-half size of an 
egg. Boil until it strings, without stirring, then add one 
teaspoonful vanilla. Beat until almost hard. Cover the 
bottom of a greased tin with black walnut meats and pour 
mixture over this. Mark off in squares. — Miss Emily Burr. 

Fudge. — Cook three cups sugar, one cup milk and one 
tablespoon butter. When sugar is melted add six or seven 
tablespoons cocoa. Stir and boil fifteen minutes. Take 
from fire, add one teaspoon vanilla, stir till creamy, pour 
on buttered plates, cut in squares. 

Vassar Fudge. — Two cups granulated sugar, one cup 
of milk, one-half cup chocolate, butter size of walnut. Boil 
fifteen minutes, stiring all the time. Then remove from 
stove and stir until it begins to grain. Flavor with vanilla. 

Chocolate Candy. — Four cups of brown sugar, one- 
half cup butter, one-fourth cake Walter Baker's Chocolate 
broken in pieces; one cup hot water. Boil until it will 
harden in water; then beat for five minutes, pour in greased

Lutheran ( )bserver. | 

::: To Remove Tea and Coffee Stains.— Soak the stained 
fabric in cold water: spread out and pour a few drops of 
glycerine on each spot. Let it stand several hours; then 
wash with cold water and soap. 

"To Remove Chocolate and Cocoa Stains. — Wash with 
soap in tepid water. 

::: To Remove Mildew. — Soak in a weak solution of 
chloride of lime for several hours. Rinse in cold water. 

Another. — Wet the cloth, rub on a mixture of soap and 
chalk, and place the article in the sun. 

*To Remove Iron Rust. — Soak the stain thoroughly 
with lemon juice; sprinkle with salt and bleach for several 
hours in the sun. 

Another. — Take lemon juice and salt mixed together, 
place on spot and lay the article in the sun. Repeat if nec- 
essary. 

"To Remove Fruit Stains. — Stretch the fabric contain- 
ing- the stain over the month of a basin and pour boiling 
water on the stain. In cold weather fruit stains can fre- 
quently he removed by hanging the stained garments oul 
of doors over night. If the stain has been fixed by time, 
soak the article in a weak solution of oxalic acid or hold 
it over the fumes of sulphur. 

::: To Remove Ink Stains. — Soak in sour milk. If a dark 
stain remains, rinse in a weak solution of chloride of lime. 

Another. — Din the spot in pure melted tallow, wash 
out the tallow .and the ink will also be removed. 

::: To Remove Scorch Stains. — Wet the scorched place. 
rub with soap and bleach in the sun. 

8 9 



*To Remove Vaseline Stains. — Saturate the spots with 
ether and lay a cup over it to prevent evaporation until the 
stain is removed. Use the ether with very great care. 

*To Remove Blood Stains. — Soak in cold salt water; 
then wash in warm water with plenty of soap; afterward 
boil. 

::: To Remove Grass Stains. — Saturate the spot thor- 
oughly with kerosene, then put in the washtub. 

*To Remove Iodine Stains. — Wash with alcohol, then 
rinse in soapy water. 

To Remove Sewing Machine Oil Stains. — Rub with 
lard ; let stand for several hours, then wash with cold water 
and soap. 

*To Remove Pitch, Wheel Grease and Tar Stains. — 
Soften the stains with lard, then soak in turpentine. Scrape 
off carefully with a knife all the loose surface dirt; sponge 
clean with turpentine and rub gently till dry. 

*To Remove Grease Spots. — Hot water and soap gen- 
erally remove these. If fixed by long standing, use ether, 
chloroform or naptha. All three of these must be used 
away from either fire or artificial light. 

Grease spots may be removed from any delicate color 
with French chalk, which is sold by all druggists. Scrape 
this on the spots and rub it in somewhat; then allow it to 
remain for twenty-four hours, brush off lightly, and if the 
grease has not entirely disappeared, repeat the rubbing of 
the chalk. 

To Remove Grease Spots from Silk. — Lay the grease 
spot upon a thick sheet of blotting or brown paper; place 
another piece of the same paper over the -spot, and press 
a moderately warm flatiron over it for a minute or two, 
until the stain disappears. Rub the stained part with a 
bit of soft silk or flannel. 

To Wash Soiled Ribbons and Ties.— Rub carefully 
through a solution of one-half teaspoonful of ammonia to 
one cupful of water. If much soiled put through a second 
water with less ammonia. Lay between clean white cloths 
and press until dry. 

90 



To Restore Velvet. — When velvet gets crushed from 

pressure, hold the parts over a basin of hot water, with the 
lining of the dress next to the water. This will soon cause 
the crushed part to assume its original form. 

To Bleach Yellow Linen. — Soak in buttermilk two or 
three days. Wash carefully and lay in sun. 

*To Prevent Fading. — Wash goods liable to fade 
should be washed in a strong solution of salt, allowing a 
cup of salt to a quart of hot water. While the water is 
warm put the material in, and let it lie for a time; then 
take out and wash in the usual way. 

*Kerosene in Washing. — Kerosene in the boiling water 
whitens clothes safely, especially such as are yellow from 
lying. Put in a tablespoonful to each gallon of suds. 

For very yellow or grimy thing, make an emulsion 
of kerosene, clear lime water and turpentine in equal parts. 
Shake them together until creamy; then add a cupful to 
a boilerful of clothes and boil for half an hour. 

The same emulsion is very good for very dirty things, 
such as jumpers, overalls, working shirts, children's 
trousers. Use it in conjunction with strong suds, as hot 
as the hand can bear, and rub a little directly upon dirty 
grease spots. Let the clothes stand the minutes before 
washing out and be sure to have the second suds and the 
rinsing water as hot as the first. 

*To Remove Soot Stains. — Rub the spots with dry 
cornmeal before sending the clothes to the wash. 

To Make a Stiff Starch. — Tut an ounce oi gum arabic 
(not the powdered) in a pitcher and pour on it one-half 
pint boiling water. Let the mixture remain covered over 
night, and in the morning turn it into a bottle. If tightly 
corked, the solution will keep for a long time. To a quart 
of starch, after it has been boiled, add two tablespoons ^\ 
the liquid gum arabic; let the starch again come to a boil 
and cook until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, then 
add a little salt to keep from sticking, ami you have a 
starch that will not disappoint you, for its results are ex- 
tremely satisfactory. Shirt waists when starched this way 



have a clear appearance not obtained by the ordinary meth- 
od of starching, and keep clean longer. 

*To Prevent the Iron from Sticking. — Put a spoonful 
of kerosene into the cold starch. 

Washing Fluid. — One box Babbit's lye, one ounce salts 
of tartar, one ounce carbonate ammonia, two gallons water, 
let come to a boil, put in ingredients, add two or three 
tablespoons borax. Bottle tight, use one-half cup to a 
boiler of water. — Mrs. W. C. Garber. 

Rosin Soap. — Twenty-four quarts soft water, six 
pounds tallow, three pounds rosin, two pounds caustic soda, 
put in large kettle, boil slowly about two hours. — Mrs. W. 
C. Garber. 

*To Clean Gilded Frames. — Gently wipe them with a 
fine cotton cloth dipped in sweet oil. 

*To Clean a Greasy Sink. — To clean a greasy sink, a 
little paraffin oil, rubbed in with flannel, will save trouble. 

*To Remove Tea Marks from China. — Ordinary tea 
marks on china may be readily dissolved by scrubbing with 
a soft brush dipped in salt water and vinegar. 

*To Renovate Leather Chairs. — Leather chairs and tops 
of writing tables are renovated by sponging them lightly 
with warm soap-suds and then rubbing on the white of an 
egg whipped stiff. Or, if this seems like wasting the egg. 
rub over the leather a mixture of half a cup of sweet oil to 
a cupful of vinegar; boil together, and polish the leather 
with the useful piece of old flannel. When willow chairs 
lose their natural color, it is said that a solution of chlorine 
will restore it. 

*To Remove Spots from Leather. — Oxalic acid, in weak 
solution, is the best thing to use when removing spots from 
leather. Two or three crystals of oxalic acid dissolved in 
warm water, then applied with a bit of cloth to the spots, 
will do the work. But one must watch closely, and, as 
soon as the spot disappears, apply clear water to overcome 
the acid, which is a powerful bleacher. Afterward dry the 
leather with a clean cloth. This process applies as well to 
ink spots that sometimes disfigure the leather covers of 
books. For tan-colored sheepskin covers a saturated solu- 

92 



tion may be used. For any bright colored leather, the so- 
lution must be much weaker. * 

To Remove Soot from Carpet. — Sprinkle heavily with 
salt and then sweep. 

To Wash Matting. — Wipe ntf with a cloth wrung from 
salt water. This will prevent from turning yellow. 

To clean Kid Gloves. — Dip a fine, clean soft cloth into a 
little sweet milk, then rub the cloth on a cake of soap, then 
with this cloth rub the gloves. 

To Clean Mica. — Clean with vinegar slightly diluted 
with water. If the mica does not become clean immediately 
let it remain in the vinegar a short time. 

To Clean New Iron Kettles. — Boil in them one hour, a 
good-sized handful of hay. Then scour with soap and sand. 
Fill again with clear water and place over fire until water 
boils. After this treatment they will not color anything 
boiled in them. 

To Clean Stovepipe.— A piece of zinc put on the live 
coals in the stove will clean out the stovepipe. 

To Preserve Washtubs.— When done washing turn 
bottom side up and cover bottom with water. This will 
prevent staves spreading apart at top. 

To purify a Cistern. — When the water has an unpleas- 
ant odor suspend in the water a muslin cloth containing one 
or more pounds of charcoal. 

To Keep Lemons. — Cover with cold water changing 
w r ater once a week. 

Plaster Paris and Vinegar. — Plaster Paris mixed with 
vinegar instead of water will not set for twenty or thirty 
minutes. 

A Mosquito Remedy. — Take a piece of paper rolled 
around a lead pencil to form a case and fill this with very 
dry Persian insect powder, putting in a little at a time and 
pressing it down well with a pencil. This cartridge may be 
set in a cup of sand to hold it erect. An hour before going 
to bed close the room and burn one of these cartridges. 
( )ne will answer for a small room, but take two for a large 
room. This will effectually dispose of the mosquitoes. 

To Toughen Lamp Chimneys. — Place the chimney in 

93 



a pot of cold water, to which some salt has been added. 
Boil the water well and then cool slowly. Glass treated 
thus will withstand a sudden change of temperature. 

To Remove a Glass Stopper. — 1 leat the neck of the 
bottle a few seconds with a lighted match. 

Canned Fruit. — Canned fruit is improved by being 
opened an hour or two before being used. This restores 
the oxygen to the fruit. 

To Preserve Cider. — Allow it to work until it has 
reached the state most desirable to the taste, then add one 
and one-half tumblers iA grated horseradish to each barrel 
and shake up well. This prevents further fermentation. 
After remaining a few weeks, rack ^\( and bung up closely 
in clean casks. 



WHAT HOUSEKEEPERS SHOULD REMEMBER. 



That cold rain water and soap will remove machine 
grease from washable fabrics. 

That fish may be scaled much easier by first dipping 
them into boiling water for a minute. 

That fresh meat, beginning to sour, will sweeten if 
placed out of doors in the cool air oxer night. 

That milk which has changed may be sweetened or 
rendered fit for use again by stirring in a little soda. 

That boiling starch is much improved by the addition 
n\ sperm or salt, or both, or a little gum arabic dissolved. 

That a tablespoonful of turpentine, boiled with your 
white clothes, will greatly aid in the whitening process. 

That kerosene will soften boots and shoes that have 
been hardened by water, and will render them as pliable as 
new. 

That thoroughly wetting the hair once or twice with a 
solution of salt and water will keep it from falling out. 

That salt fish are quickest ami best freshened by soak- 
in sour milk. 

'J Tat one teaspoon fnl of ammonia to a teacup of water 

94 



applied with a rag will clean silver or gold jewelry p 

fcctly. 

That salt will curdle new milk, hence in preparing por- 
ridge, gravies, etc., sail should not be added until the dish 
is prepared. 

That paint stains that are dry and old may be removed 
from cotton or woolen goods with chloroform, h is a good 
plan to first cover the spot with olive oil <>r butter. 

That clear boiling water will remove tea stains; pour 
the water through the stain and thus prevent its spread- 
ing over the fabric. 

That charcoal is recommended as an absorber of g; 
in the milk room where foul gases are present. It should 
be freshly powdered and kepi there continually, especially 

in hot weather, when unwholesome odors are most liable 
to infect milk. 

That by applying kerosene with a rag when yon are 
about to put your stoves away for the summer, will pre- 
vent them from rusting. Treat your farming implements in 

the same way before- you lay them aside in the fall. 

That a teaspoonful of borax put in the last water in 
which clothes are rinsed, will whiten them surprisingly. 
Pound the borax so that it will dissolve easily. This 
especially good to remove the yellow that time gives to 
white garments that have been laid aside for two or three 
years. 

That a good agency for keeping the air of the cellar 
sweet and wholesome, is whitewash made of good white 
lime and water only. The addition of glue or size, or any- 
thing of this class, is only a damage by furnishing organic 
matter to speedily putrify. The use of lime in whitewash 
is not simply to give a white color, but it greatly prom* 
the complete oxidation of effluvia in the cellar air. Any 
vapors that contain combined nitrogen in the un oxidized 
form contribute powerfully to the development of dis< 
germs.

All Good Housekeepers Should Know Why Some Things 

Are Done. 

Why do you take milk in your tea? Most persons 
would answer, because they like it that way. But the 
scientists have found a deeper reason placing the custom 
on purely scientific grounds, says a writer in the New 
York Press. These learned ones discourse as follows: 

We use sugar in our tea to prevent injury to the 
coatings of our stomachs. Whenever tannic acid and al- 
bumen meet, they fall desperately in love with each other, 
get married and live together ever afterwards as tannat of 
albumen, or leather. Now, there is tannic acid in tea and 
a lot of albumen in the coating of the stomach. The tannic 
acid weds as much of this as is allowed by the laws of 
chemistry and so far injures the stomach. 

But milk also contains albumen. When milk is added 
to tea, therefore, the molecules of tannic acid select their 
albumen partners from it, and as a divorce is unknown to 
tannate of albumen the albumen of the stomach remains 
single, and so the lining of the stomach is uninjured. 

Now, you may imagine that when you mix a salad 
dressing you put vinegar in because it tastes better made 
that way, but you are wrong again. It is for a chemical 
reason, which is as follows : 

Raw vegetables are easily enough digested by cows and 
horses, but with difficulty by the human stomach, because 
they contain that hard, fibrous substance, cellulose. But 
acids dissolve cellulose, and vinegar is an acid. That is 
why we take it with salad and cabbage, and doubtless that 
is why it tastes so well, for the palate is an excellent judge 
of what is good for the stomach. Oil is added for the very 
good reason that it protects the lining of the stomach from 
the action of acid in the vinegar. 

Why do we take butter on bread? Partly because 
wheaten flour does not contain enough fat and partly be- 
cause butter contains a trifling quantity of substances called 
''extractives," which in some unknown way stimulate the 
appetite and aid digestion. 

96 



\\ hy do we take pepper, mustard and spices? Because 
they tickk- the glands of the stomach and make them work 
Consequently they produce an abundant supply of digestive 
jmces. The) also stir up the liver, and a stirring up of this 
organ is an important thing for people who live sedentary 
lives. 



:: A Reliable Baking Powder.— Mam housewiv< 
ject to usm-- the baking powder on the market, owing to 
the possibility of adulteration. Will such try the following 
formula? Sift three times a quarter of a pound of flour, 
a quarter of a pound of baking soda, and half a pound of 
cream tartar. Store in an airtight can. 

::: To Keep Tinware from Rusting.— If new tinware is 
rubbed over with fresh lard thoroughly heated in the oven 
before it is used, it will never rusl afterward, no matter 
how much it is put in water. For stained tinware borax 
produces the best results. If the teapot or coffepol is dis- 
colored on the inside, lx.il it in a strong solution of borax 
for a short time and all its brightness will return. 

::: To disinfect Water.— In traveling, when it is im: 
sible to gel boiled or filtered water, the juice of a lemon 
will do quite as well. Squeeze a little into a -lass of water, 
let it stand for a few moments, and the water will he thor- 
oughly disinfected. 

::: A Good Furniture Glue.— A good furniture -hie that 
dees not harden ami which has long been in use in the 
family from which the recipe is got, i> easily made. Dis- 
solve five cents' worth of gelatine in five cents' worth acetic 
acid and bottle. 

:: Worth Trying. — A new enameled or agate ware kitch- 
en vessel should he tilled with clean water ami placed over 
a hot fire. Just when the water begins to boil drop into it 
a teaspoonful of borax and a lemon cut in half. Let the 
water boil rapidly for ten minutes, then remove the ves- 
sel, and (\n not empty it until quite cool. It is said this is 
the best annealing process for such wares, and that it will 
prevent the enamel lining from chipping, which is the only 
fault that can be found in these article-. 

97 



-Simple Method of Sterilizing Milk. — If one cannot 
procure bottles, or the proper sterilizing apparatus, which 
cost about two dollars, put the quantity of food to be used 
in twenty-four hours into the double boiler, and let it re- 
main for ten minutes after the water in the outside com- 
partment has boiled. Cover during the process. Pour the 
milk into a self-sealing jar and stop the mouth with a plug 
of cotton wool. Keep the jar in the ice-chest, and do not 
leave the plug out after removing part of the contents. 

DOMESTIC EMERGENCIES. 



The suggestions which follow are confined to simple 
measures which do not require the use of drugs. They 
mainly touch upon emergencies which arise in the house- 
hold at a time or when medical assistance cannot be imme- 
diately procured. In all emergencies the first thing to do 
is to send for a physician. 

Fever. — Undress the person and put him to bed. Do 
not cover up too warm ; he will be more comfortable with 
a moderate amount of covering. Give cooling drinks ; 
nothing to eat ; except milk. Bathing with Pond's Extract 
will give relief. 

Colic or Cholera Morbus. — Apply heat in the form of 
hot water bags, or bottles, hot plates and mustard plaster 
over the seat of pain. Hot baths are sometimes useful. 

Diarrhoea — Dystentery. — For a simple diarrhoea, gin- 
ger tea, peppermint or other warm drink will usually bring 
relief. A tablespoonful of sweet oil for an adult, or tea- 
spoonful for a child, will relieve irritation. For dysentery, 
which follows diarrhoea, rest in bed, hot compresses, or 
mustard plasters applied to abdomen and soles of feet, will 
bring relief. 

Vomiting. — Patient should always lie down. Give 
large amounts of hot water, as hot as can be taken. Or 
small bits of ice held in mouth or swallowed, or a lump of 
ice against the pit of the stomach, will sometimes bring 
relief. When other means fail, apply a mustard plaster to 
the pit of the stomach. 

98 



Hiccough.— In severe attacks apply mustard plasters 
over the stomach. Hot vinegar, brandy or whiskey applied 
in the same manner will sometimes bring relief Let the 
patient draw a deep breath and hold it as long as possible 

Angina Pectoris.— Apply cold over the region of the 
heart. Hot applications, such as hot water bags, hot cloths 
and mustard plaster may be used where cold applical 
tail. Inhale amyl nitrate. 

t Asthma.— Susceptible persons should keep a supply of 
suitable burning o r inhaling material (asthma cigarettes! 
for immediate use. If such are not at hand, saturate a piece 
of blotting paper with a strong solution of saltpeter dry 
and ignite; let the patient inhale the fumes. If no other 
means are at hand, let the person attacked engage in some 
diversion, such as smoking a cigar or pipe, reading a book 
or paper, writing, etc. 

Croup.— In sudden attacks the playing with a toy or 
listening to a story may cause symptoms to disappear. 
Keep the room warm and have water boiling j n the room 
in such a way that the steam will reach the sufferer. \,»i.lv 
Hannels wrung Q ut in hot water to the throat and cover 
with some waterproof material. Use mustard plaster on 
the soles of the feet and chest (for a few minutes only). 
Apply hot toot baths; if no relief, try cold. [ n membran- 
eous croup, slack lime in the room, allowing the patient to 
inhale. Never neglect to summon a physician. 
t Hernia-Strangulation.— Place the patient on his back 
in bed; elevate the foot of the bed about twelve- inches' 
bend the legs back toward the abdomen. Apply to the 
hernia towels or cloths wrung out in hot water-" if th 
do not bring relief, apple cold. 

Cramps.— Bathe the part in water as hot as can be 
borne; apply mustard plaster to the part affected, and to the 

extremities. 

_ Suppression of Urine.— \ppl v hot cloths over bladder; 

give warm sitz bath. Walking over a cold wet tloor or 
dashing cold water on the legs and thighs will often bring 
relief. &
