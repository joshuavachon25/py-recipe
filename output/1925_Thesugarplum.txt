COMPILER'S NOTE 

THE third edition of The Sugar Plum 
is issued at the request of many who 
have had the previous editions. It has 
been revised, slightly enlarged and im- 
proved in several ways. 

The aim of the Compiler was to give 
only those recipes which have been tried, 
tested and used by good housekeepers, 
and many that one does not find in the 
every day cook book. Some are old, 
some new, some original. It is the earn- 
est hope that the little book may be of 
some help and value to those who may 
use it as an accessory to their standard 
cook book.
