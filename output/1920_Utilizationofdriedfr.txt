UTILIZATION OF DRIED FRUITS AW VEOTABLES* 



Owing to the present high price of sugar and containers, the 
drying of fruits and vegetables should be stressed. If properly dried and 
carefully stored these products may to a large extent take the place of 
fresh or canned fruits and vegetables* They should not be kept indef initelyi 
however, since they deteriorate during long storage. Hence it would be 
wise to use the supply of dried products early in the winter, leaving the 
canned goods until later. 

Soaking * 

It is generally supposed that soaking of dried products for some 
hours previous to cooking, is essential. The following statements issued 
by the Office of Home Economics will be interesting as well as very helpful. 

I» Dried Green String Beans . - Soaking dried beans over night 
sometimes gives slightly more desirable results than those cooking without 
any previous soaking, but usually this is not the case. As a rule, the 
better the character of the dried beans, the less likely that they will 
require soaking. The following directions should cover all casesi since 
soaking usually does no harm if the proper proportion of water is used and 
if the beans are cooked in the same water in which they ar© soaked. 

Use three times as much water by measure as beans (no more), and 
allow to soak over night in a cool place. Then bring slowly to a boil in 
the same water in which they were soaked, salting to taste. Boil gentlyi 
covered, until tender, which will require about 3/4 hour if the beans are of 
good quality. When tender, the beans may be prepared according to any 
preferred recipe, by the same methods which would be uaed for fresh 
string beans. 

II. Dried Corn * - The matter of soaking dried corn over night 
depends entirely on the character of the particular sample of corn which is 
under consideration. Certain samples of corn (horn© dried, and by far the 
best encountered, as it happened), did not require any soaking whatever. 
Other samples all required soaking over night , but they were never as tender 
or sweet as were those samples which did not require soaking. For soaking, 
from two to three parts of water to one of corn may be required, but as 
little as possible should be used. Cook at a low heat until tender* 

III. Dried Soup Mixtures . - In all cases which have been tested 
(with the exception of one sample) soaking did not improve this product* 

Therefore, cook v/ithout previous soaking by boiling for 1 hour in 
3 parts water to 1 part soup mixture. Then the cooked vegetables may be 
281 



used in the same way as are freshly cooked vegetables; or for soup, the 
soup mixture may be added directly to broth or stock and cooked in a much 
larger amount of liquid. 

IV » Dried Apples . - Apples cooked without soaking, were con- 
sidered to be of better flavor than were those which had been soaked. 

Dried apples should be cooked unsoaked in one or two parts of 
water by measure to one of apple, depending on the quality of the dried 
product. With the best products, an equal measure of fruit and water was 
sufficient* Cook by simmering gently about an hour or until tender « 

V« Dried Peaches » ~ It is not absolutely necessary to soak 
dried peaches t In order to cook them successfully, however, by soaking 
them over night (using two parts of water by measure to one of fruit) one 
may obtain the fruit in a condition which bears a close resemblance to the 
fresh product. Although fairly good results may be obtained by cooking 
the dried peach without previous soaking, it must be admitted that the pro- 
duct then seems more nearly to resemble a peach preserve than if it has 
had a preliminary soaking* 

VI* Dried Pears * - Dried pears may be cooked without previous 
soaking; for, generally speaking, even a brief soaking of pears tends to 
dilute the flavor, which is necessarily rather mild at best* However, _ 
soaking overnight may be an advantage where a pear pulp is desired, as in 
naking a strained pear sauce or Blanc Mange ♦ 

The proportion of water to fruit may vary from 1 to 3 measures 
of water to 1 part of fruit, depending on the cooking method and the amount 
of evaporation involved. A minimum amount of water is desirable to secure 
the best flavor; but in all cases, on the other hand, there should be 
enough water to cover, or nearly cover the fruit* Long, slow cooking im- 
proves the flavor of dried pears greatly* 

VII* Dried Apricots * - Apricots do not require soaking* They 
are best prepared by s3.mmering gently or by cooking in a pan set over hot 
water for 1 hour, using an equal measure of water to fruit, or barely 
enough water to cover*. 

VIII. Dried Prunes* - Prunes do not require soaking* Soaking 
dilutes the f le.vox^ and gives a mushy texture* A minimum proportion of 
water to fruit is desirable* Usually this is about 1 measure of fruit to 
1 measure of water, or enough water to barely cover the fruit* 

A longer cooking period than 1 hour gives a slight caramel flavor, 
which may be considered desirable by some persons* 

Due to wide variations in the character of different samples of 
dried fruits and vegetables it cannot be said that these directions will 
apply literally in all cases. 

It will be noticed that the terms "barely covered" and "well cov- 
ered" are frequently used» When the fruit is "well covered" it is meant that 



281 



-3- 



is conpletely ionersed ; when "barely covered" the water reaches a level even 
with the top layer of fruit.

canned fruits, such as cherries or pineapple, or fresh fruits, such as oranges, 
bananas, or grapes may be used together with dried fruits* 

Use of Dried Fruits in Bakinp; 

Dried fruits are especially popular and useful for pies, cakes and 
baked or steamed puddings. By the blending of tart fruits with those rather 
sweet, many variations in flavor may bo had and a considerable saving in 
sugar effected* Thus, comb5.nations of prunes and pears, apricots and pears, 
apples and raisins, and peaches and figs will all be found acceptable, and 
will make possible a greater use of the rather sweet or more insipid fruits.
