FOOD CONSERVATION 



Let us remember tliat every flag that flies opposite the German 
one is, by proxy, the American flag, and that the armies fighting in our 
defense under these flags cannot be maintained thro the winter unless 
there is food enough for them and for their women and children at 
home. There can only be food enough if America provides it. America 
can provide it only by the personal service and co-operation of all. The 
small daily substitution can be done by all ; the saving in waste by the 
majority and the lessening food consumed by many." 

This little book is not published as a cook book in the sense that it 
covers all phases of cookery. It is the outcome of an earnest desire to 
know how, in the average home, one may conserve some materials and 
substitute others for those needed most by our men and Allies, without 
radically changing the daily menu or method of living. By giving the 
matter earnest thought we may easily plan for seven wheatless, four- 
teen meatless, and twenty-one wasteless meals each week and serve food 
which is attractive, palatable, and sufficient for the daily needs of the 
body. While leaving eggs and milk out of many recipes, lessens the 
food value of the dishes, this often seems a wise elmination. Eggs, 
when used, should be looked upon as a meat substitute, and the child- 
ren often need the milk.

4 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

THE DAY'S FOOD 

A man who does fairly hard muscular work would be likely to 
get the food which his body needs if supplied daily with such a combi- 
nation of foods as the following: 
1/4 pounds of bread, having about the same food value as i pound of 

such cereal preparations as wheat or rye flour, oatmeal, cornmeal, 

rice, etc. 
2 ounces, or ^ cup, of butter, oil, meat drippings, or other fat. 

2 ounces, or ^ cup, of sugar; or 1-3 cup of honey, or sirup or an equiv- 

alent amount of other sweet. 
1%. pounds of food from the following: Fresh fruits and green or root 

vegetables. 
12 ounces of food from a class which may be called "meats and meat 

substitutes ;" that is, moderately fat meats, poultry, fish, eggs, 

cheese, dried legumes (beans, peas, lentils, cowpeas, and peanuts). 

Milk also belongs among these foods, but because of the large 

amount of water it contains half a glass, or 4 ounces, of it would 

be required to equal an ounce of any one of the others. 

A man who works hard out of doors all day probably would need 
more food than this, and one who sits all day at his desk would need 
less. The amounts given are suitable for a man who, like a salesman 
in a store, walks about more or less and does more or less of such work 
as lifting. 

A family consisting of a man and a woman who do moderately 
hard muscular work and three children — say, between 3 and 12 years 
of age — would get the food they require if supplied daily with: 
4j^ pounds of bread, having the same food value as 3 pounds of wheat 

or rye flour, oatmeal, cornmeal or hominy, or rice ; or about 2^ 

pounds of cereals and 5 or 6 medium-sized potatoes. 
^ cup of fat (butter or butter with oil, beef drippings, or other fat) — 

a weekly allowance of 2j^ to 3 pounds. 
A little more than i cup of sugar, or a weekly allowance of 4 pounds ; 

or an equivalent amount of some other sweet. 
4 pounds in all of fresh fruits and fresh or root vegetables. 

One of the two following, the choice depending on the age of the 
children : 

3 quarts of milk and i pound of other foods taken from the meat and 

meat-substitute group. 
2 quarts of milk and i^ pounds of other foods taken from the meat and 
meat-substitute group. 

WHAT THE DAY'S FOOD SHOULD PROVIDE 

The above meals would supply the following substances in about 
the right proportions to keep the family in healthful condition and to 
make the food taste good, providing they were well prepared. 

A. Mineral substances of great variety (lime salts, compounds of 
phosphorous, iron, and others). — These are used by the body for build- 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 3 

ing material and are found in all parts of it. They also produce sub- 
stances within the body tissues which tend to offset acid substances 
produced in the tissues in the course of digestion of meats and cereals, 
and serve many other important uses. Without fruits and vegetables 
the meals would be likely to lack certain mineral substances. Without 
milk they would be lacking in a mineral substance specially needed by 
children ; that is, lime. 

B. Protein. — Protein serves as fuel for the body and also pro- 
vides a certain important element, nitrogen, which is needed in the case 
of children for growth and in the case of both children and grown peo- 
ple to keep the body in repair. Without the meat or meat substitutes 
(including milk) the meals would be lacking in this body-building ma- 
terial. 

C. Starch. — This is one of the chief fuels of the body and is sup- 
plied mainly by the cereal foods. 

D. Sugar. — This serves as fuel for the body and to flavor the 
food. It is found in milk, fresh fruits, and many other materials, but 
unless small amounts of very sweet materials — sugar itself, sirup, or 
honey — are used, the diet is likely to be lacking in it. 

E. Fat. — This serves as body fuel and also improves the flavor 
and texture of the food. It is present in meats, nuts, and many other 
foods, but unless small amounts of specially fat materials, like butter, 
oil, or cream, are used, the meals are likely to be lacking in it. More- 
over, dishes cooked without a certain amount of fat and meals served 
without butter or some substitute seem, to most persons, dry and un- 
palatable. 

F. Cellulose.- — This is the material which makes up the frame- 
work of plants. It gives bulk to the diet and may tend to prevent con- 
stipation. Without the fruits and vegetables the meals would be lack- 
ing in this important element. 

G. Certain nezvly discovered substances in very small amounts, 
which are believed to play an important part in keeping people well 
and in promoting the growth of children. Without milk in the diet 
some of these substances, particularly those necessary for children, 
would be lacking, and without meat, milk, eggs, fruits, and vegetables 
others needed by persons of all ages might not be present in sufficient 
amounts. 

H. Flavorings and condiments. — In most families some materials 
are used in preparing or serving food which add to the attractiveness 
of the meals without furnishing the body any nourishment. Among 
these are salt, pepper, vinegar, lemon juice, spices, seasoning herbs, 
horse-radish, flavoring extracts, and many other materials often spoken 
of as "condiments." These are not discussed at length, because they 
are not absolutely needed by the body. They may, however, be very 
useful in making an otherwise unattractive diet taste good. In fact, 
the secret of making inexpensive meals attractive lies largely in the 
skillful use of seasoning and flavors, and in this way they may well be 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 6 

worth the cost they add to the diet even if they do not increase its actual 
food value. 

Any kind of food contains one or more of the substances just des- 
cribed, and they are combined in as many different ways as there are 
kinds of food. A satisfactory diet contains all of them and each in its 
proper proportion, and the problem of planning meals is really that of 
choosing foods which will do this. 

GROUPING FOODS TO SHOW THEIR USES 

Group i. — Foods depended on for mineral matters, 
vegetable acids, and body-regulating substances. 

Fruits : Vegetables : 

Apples, pears, etc. Salads- — lettuce, celery, etc. 

Bananas Potherbs or "greens." 

Berries, Potatoes and root vegetables. 

Melons. Green peas, beans, etc. 

Oranges, lemons, etc. Tomatoes, squash, etc. 

Etc. Etc. 

Group 2. — Foods depended on for protein. 

Milk, skim milk, cheese, etc. Fish. 

Eggs. Dried peas, beans, cowpeas, etc. 

Meat. Nuts. 

Poultry. 

Group 3. — Foods depended on for starch. 

Cereal grains, meals, flours, etc. Cakes, cookies, starchy puddings. 

Cereal breakfast foods. etc. 

Bread. Potatoes and other starchy vege- 

Crackers. tables. 

Macaroni and other pastes. 

Group 4. — Foods depended on for sugar. 

Sugar, Candies. 

Molasses. Fruits preserved in sugar, jellies. 

Sirups. and dried friuts. 

Honey. Sweet cakes and desserts. 

Group 5. — Foods depended on for fat. 

Butter and cream. Salt pork and bacon. 

Lard, suet, and other cooking fats. Table and salad oils. 

Thinking of foods according to the group to which they belong or 
according to the nutrient which they supply in largest amount will help 
the housekeeper to see whether in the meals she plans she has supplied 
all the different materials needed, especially whether there is the neces- 



WAR-TIME COOKEIRY 7 

sary, though small, amount of tissue-building mineral matters and body- 
regulating materials (group i), and of tissue-building protein (group 
2). When she has made sure that these are present, she may safely 
build up the bulk of the diet from whatever materials from the other 
groups that seem economical, wholesome, and appetizing. By means 
of this grouping she will be reminded that meals consisting only of 
cereal mush (group 3) served with butter (group 5) and sirup (group 
4) would not be a complete ration, and would almost surely be lacking 
in body-building material, because there are no foods from either group 
I (fruits and vegetables) or group 2 (protein rich). It will become 
clear, also, that a school lunch of a kind far too frequently served, con- 
sisting of bread and cake, is lacking in the same way. and that a glass 
of milk (group 2) and an apple or an orange (group i) would make 
it far more nearly complete. She w^ill learn the wisdom of serving fruit 
(group i) rather than a whipped-cream dessert (group 5) or a suet 
pudding (groups 3 and 5) after a course including a generous portion of 
fat meat (groups 2 and 5). 

The grouping will also help the housekeeper who wishes to save 
money or time to simplify her meals without making them one-sided 
or incomplete. For example, if she has been serving bread, potatoes, 
and rice or hominy in one meal, she will see that one or even two of 
them may be left out without omitting any important nutrient, provid- 
ing a reasonable quantity of the one or two remaining is eaten. It will 
show her that a custard which is made of milk and eggs, two foods 
from group 2, would hardly be needed after a meal in which a liberal 
supply of meat had been served, provided one ate heartily of all, and 
that a child does not need milk at the same meal with an egg or meat. 
It will suggest that baked beans or other legumes, or thick soups made 
of legumes, are substitutes for meat rather than foods to be eaten with 
meat. 

Use cereals (flour, meal, cereal breakfast foods, etc) freely, taking- 
pains to prepare them with great care and to vary the kind used from 
day to day if necessary to keep people from tiring of them. 

Remember that a quart of whole milk a day for each child, to be 
used as a beverage and in cookery, is not too much. 

Remember that while skim milk should never be substituted for 
whole milk as the principal food in a child's diet, it is as valuable as 
whole milk as a source of protein and mineral matters in the general 
diet. 

Remember that, except in the case of milk for children, the amount 
needed of foods specially useful for body-building purposes — that is, 
meats and meat substitutes, fruits, and vegetables — is not large, but 
what is needed is needed very much. 

'Do not be ashamed to plan closely. Thrift in food means providing: 
enough food, neither too little nor too much. 

Many inexpensive materials can be made attractive and the diet 
can be pleasantly varied by a wise use of different flavorings. 



8 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

"Finicky" tastes in food often prevent the use of many valuable 
materials which might be the means of saving money. 

Good food habits are an important part of personal hygiene and 
thrift. Children get such habits by having suitable amounts of suitable 
foods served to them and then being expected to eat what is set before 
them. 

True economy lies not only in buying wisely, but also in making the 
fullest possible use of what is bought.

MEASUREMENTS 

All measurements are level. To measure a teaspoonful of material 
fill the spoon and level it with the edge of a knife. To measure 3^ tea- 
spoonful, cut lengthwise of the material in the spoon.

Oven Tests 

Use heavy white paper about the weight of letter paper. The white 
cards used in filing cabinets may be purchased by the hundred and each 
'.card cut into several pieces. Old, light weight visiting cards may be 
^utilized. Or, i t. flour may be spread thinly in a pan and used for test- 
ing. While these tests are important for a beginner, one should soon 
become accustomed to the hand test, which will vary greatly with the 
individual. Put a piece of paper on the grate in the center of the oven ; 
when it becomes a golden brown vvithin a certain time the oven is the 
.right temperature. 

Allow 2 min. for browning the paper for the temperature to be 
right for starting popovers and puff paste. 

Allow 3 min. for biscuits, muffins, and small or layer butter cakes. 

Allow 4 min. for starting loaf butter cakes. 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 9 

Allow 5 min. for starting bread, and for small or layer spoi-) e cakes 
and meringue for pies. 

Allow 6 min. for loaf sponge cake. 

When the paper browns in 3 min. the oven is hot. When it browns 
in 5 min. the oven is moderate.

Method I. Melt butter and when it bubbles and is frothy, add the 
flour mixed with the dry seasonings and cook for an instant until smooth 
and well blended, stirring all the time. Then add the milk, one-third at 
a time, and stir after each addition until the sauce has thickened ; when 
the boiling point is reached remove from the fire and serve. This is the 
quickest method of cooking the starch in the flour, due to the tempera- 
ture of the fat. and there is less liability of the butter separating from 
the mixture when the sauce is cooked in this manner. If the butter is 
very salt, scant this seasoning. Wlien sauce is made in this manner 
one must use as much fat as flour. This is more expensive than Meth- 
od II. 

Method II. Mix the flour and seasoning with a little of the cold 
milk making a smooth paste v/hich will pour. Heat the remainder of 
the milk in a double boiler, adding any amount of butter desired. When 
milk is hot, slowly pour the paste into it, stirring constantly, and con- 
tinue to stir until sauce thickens. Cook 20 min. in order to cook the 



10 war-time; cookery 

starch. This may be made not so expensive as the other sauce, as it is 
possible to use much less butter. 

Prepare all the other sauces in table in same manner, substituting 
the various liquids called for instead of the milk and adding the special 
ingredients as cheese, etc., at the last. 

The butter may be browned first, if desired, in the Brown and 
Tomato sauces. Also, for variety, cook 2 T. chopped onion, 2 cloves, a 
sprig of parsley and a tiny bit of bay leaf with the tomato before strain- 
ing. 

When the stock used in the sauces has been well seasoned no more 
salt and pepper will be required; the seasoning always depends upon.- 
amount used in stock. 

SOUPS WITHOUT MEATS 

A cream soup means one which has the consistency of thick cream.. 

A puree is twice as thick. 

These soups are a combination of a thin white sauce or other 
thickened liquid and vegetable or fish pulp. 

All such soups must be thickened somewhat to prevent a separa- 
tion of the pulp and liquid. 

The liquid may be all water, all milk or part cream, or v.ater in 
which the vegetables were cooked. The thickening may be cornstarch,, 
flour, arrowroot, cracker or bread crumbs. The fat may be cream,, 
butter, butter substitute, drippings, or oil. 

The general proportions for cream soups are from i to 2 c. vege- 
table pulp to I qt. of white sauce, No. i. The amount of pulp would 
depend upon whether it is thick like potato, or thin like celery. 

General Rules 

Cook the vegetable or fish and press through a sieve ; make a white 
sauce of fat. flour, salt, pepper and milk, and add the thinner liquid 
very gradually to the thicker. Serve hot and at once, for if kept hot 
the vegetable pulp will cause tb.e milk to curdle. In substituting corn- 
starch for flour, use only half as much. 

Tomato Soup 

I qt. tomatoes. ^ t. soda. 

I pt. water. i to 3 T. butter or other fat. 

Bit of bay leaf. 3 T. flour. 

4 cloves. 2 t. salt. 

I T. onion. 14 t. pepper or more. 

I T. sugar 

Simmer the first six ingredients in an uncovered saucepan. At the 
end of 20 min. strain and add soda. There should be i qt. of liquid. 
Combine the last four ingredients as in making white sauce. Add liquid 
and let it thicken. When mixture reaches boiling point serve.

Tomato Bisque 

I pt. of stewed and strained 4 T. flour. 

tomatoes. 2 t. salt. 

Ys t. soda. 1/3 t. pepper. 

I to 4 T. butter or other fat. i qt. milk. 

Prepare according to rule, adding soda to strained tomato while 
hot, because it will neutralize the acid quickly. Slowly add hot toma- 
toes to white sauce and serve immediately.

should be i pt. Cook the onion in the melted butter until light brown, 
remove and proceed according to general rule. If the corn is large or 
tough it may be put through the food chopper before cooking. Soak 
dried corn over night. Cook until tender and proceed according to rule. 

Asparagus Soup 

Remove the tips from freshly cooked or canned asparagus. Press 
the remainder through a sieve until there is i c. pulp and liquid. Make 
I qt. of No. 1^/2 White Sauce, add the hot asparagus and place a few of 
the tips in each plate. 

Spinach, Cauliflower, Carrot, Onion Soups, Etc. 

1 c. vegetable pulp i qt. No. White Sauce. 

Combine according to rule. 

Potato Soup 

i3/4 c. mashed potatoes. % t. celery salt. 

2 T. butter or substitute. i T. chopped onion. 
2 T. flour. I qt. milk. 

2 t. salt. 2 t. chopped parsley. 

j4 t. pepper. 

Scald the onion with the milk in a double boiler for 10 min., then 
remove. Proceed according to rule. Add sauce very slowly to the 
potato, stirring constantly, and add parsley just before serving. 

Dried Pea or Bean Soup 

1 c. peas or beans. 3 T. flour. 

2 qts. cold water. i^ t. salt 

2 T. chopped onion. ^ t. pepper. 

% lb. fat pork or ham bone. i pt. milk. - 

3 T. butter substitute. 



12 wAR-TiMi; cooke;ry 

Look over peas, wash them and soak over night in cold water. 
Drain, rinse well, add the 2 qts. of cold water, onion, pork or ham bone. 
Cook several hours, or until soft; then rub through a sieve, (there 
should be i qt.). Make a white sauce of last five ingredients and com- 
bine. Other fats may replace pork or it may be omitted and more sea- 
soning used. 

Black Bean Soup 



I c. dried black beans. 


}i t. celery salt. 


1 qt. cold water. 

2 T. chopped onion. 

3 T. butter substitute. 


Ys t. pepper. 

ys t. mustard. 

2 hard cooked eggs. 


3 T. flour. 


I lemon. 


2 t. salt, 





Prepare beans and cook with water and onion as in above recipe, 
adding more water as it boils away so there will be 13^2 qts. after strain- 
ing. 

Cook butter, flour, salt, celery salt, pepper, and mustard as for 
white sauce, add hot liquid, and when it boils serve. 

Chop the whites of the eggs, pass the yolks through a sieve and slice 
the lemon thin, removing the seeds. Put a little of the egg and a slice 
of lemon in each plate. Eggs may be omitted. 

Baked Bean Soup 

I pt. bean pulp. 2 T. butter substitute. 

1 pt. water, milk or 2 T. flour. 

tomato juice. Seasoning if required. 

If the pulp is very thick and dry use less of it and more liquid. Thin 
the pulp with liquid and with this pulp make a sauce with the other 
materials. Seasoning depends upon the amount used in the beans. 

Potato Chowder 

2 T. flour. ji c. minced onion. 
2 T. bacon or other fat. 2 c. water. 

2 t. or more, salt. i pt. potato cubes. 

Pepper i qt. milk 

Wash, peel, and cut potatoes into half inch cubes. 

Put potatoes, onion, seasoning, and water into sauce pan and sim- 
mer 20 min., or until vegetables are tender. Heat the fat, add flour, 
cook for an instant and add hot milk one-third at a time. Stir constant- 
ly so the mixture will be smooth, and when it reaches boiling point 
serve. Add more seasoning if necessary. Chopped parsley sprinkled 
over the top of the chowder makes a pleasing variation. 



war-time cookery 13 

Corn Chowder 

Same ingredients as for potato chowder adding i can or i pt. corn 
at the end. The potatoes may be decreased one half. 

Fish Chowder 

Same ingredients as for potato chowder using only i pt. potato. 
Skin, bone, and cut one pound of fish into 2-inch pieces and cook in the 
water with the potatoes. 

In all these chowder recipes the onion may be browned in the fat 
first if this flavor is desired. 

Salt Codfish may be used by first soaking in cold water to freshen. 

Vegetable Soup 

1/3 c. each of diced carrots. 4 T. butter substitute or 

turnips, celery, onion. savory drippings, 

i/^ c. potato cubes. Salt, pepper and parsley if desired. 

1 qt. water. 

Wash, scrape carrot and celery, peel turnip, onion and potatoes. 
Cut into cubes and measure. Mix vegetables (except potatoes) and 
cook in part of the fat until slightly browned. Stir them constantly. 
Add water, and let soup simmer until vegetables are partially cooked, 
then add potatoes. When tender add rest of fat and parsley and season 
mixture well. 

Meat and Vegetable Soup 

i^ lbs. beef shoulder or other 2c. carrots. 

meat. J/2 c. barley. 

2 c. tomatoes. 1^/2 T. salt. 

3 qts. water. y2 t or more pepper. 
I stalk or small bunch celery. i c. flour. 

J4 to ^ c. minced onion. 

Soak the barley for several hours in just enough water to soften. 
Put the meat through the grinder using the coarsest knife, add toma- 
toes, water, barley and onion. When meat is partially cooked add all 
other ingredients except flour. The carrots and celery may be cut in 
uniform pieces or put through the grinder. The latter takes much less 
time but does not look quite so attractive. When the soup has cooked 
long enough thicken with flour which has been mixed with sufficient 
cold water to make a smooth liquid thin enough to pour. This makes 
a thick soup and a very palatable, attractive dish. 

Dried celery leaves or celery salt may be used for seasoning if fresh 
material is not at hand. This will serve sixteen. 



14 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

USES FOR BREAD 

All bread should be utilized. The large pieces may be used for 
toast, cheese dishes, croutons, soup sticks, meat loaves, bread cases, etc. 
The white crumbs may be kept especially for omelet, and for thickening 
pies, white puddings, cheese dishes and croquettes. Stale bread of all 
kinds, crusts, baking powder biscuits, muffins, fried cakes, etc., can be 
broken into pieces, dried, run through the meat grinder or crushed fine 
with the rolling pin, and used in griddle cakes, muffins, yeast bread, 
steamed spice puddings, and scalloped dishes. Use unsweetened stale, 
but not dried crumbs for scalloped meat dishes, for stuffing fowls and 
rolled steak. 

Crumbs containing fat will not keep so well as those without. All 
crumbs should be kept in jar or crock with a piece of muslin tied over 
the top to prevent entrance of dust. If covered tight the bread will 
soon become rancid. 

Stale Crumbs 

Prepare from stale but undried bread by grating or rubbing two 
pieces together. 

Dried Crumbs 

Prepare by drying and grinding or crushing with a rolling pin. Sift 
crumbs. Use the finer ones for croquettes and thickening. Reserve 
the coarse ones for other purposes. The coarse crumbs may be re- 
ground if desired. 

Buttered Crumbs . 

Use stale bread. Remove crusts, as these are already browned 
and would produce an unevenly colored surface. 

Use I T. butter, butter substitute, drippings or oil for each cupful 
of crumbs and season with salt and pepper. Melt fat in shallow pan, 
add crumbs all at once, and toss lightly until evenly coated. Do not 
press the crumbs, as this makes them heavy. The crumbs are browned 
when the dish is placed in the oven to cook or re-heat. 
Croutons and Soup Sticks 

Cut stale bread into cubes or strips and brown in oven or in contact 
with flame. 

Milk Toast 

Prepare eight slices of toast and 2 c. of white sauce No. I. Place 
a layer of toast in the dish and over it pour part of the sauce. Re-heat. 
If a soft toast is desired dip the bread into hot water before using the 
sauce. 

Variations. Use 1^/2 c. white sauce and ^ c. strained tomato 
pulp to which has been added a pinch of soda. 

To the white sauce add >4 c. grated cheese, or 3 hard cooked eggs 
cut into pieces.

Beat eggs until yolks and whites are well mixed, but not foamy, 
add salt and milk. Dip bread into the mixture and let it stand until 
thoroughly saturated but not soft enough to break. Drain well. Place 
slices in a thoroughly greased broiler and broil over the coals or under 
the gas flame. Serve hot with butter, or sugar and cinnamon, or syrup, 
or a sauce. The bread may be sauted in fat in a frying pan but it is not 
so wholesome, as the fat is heated to a very high temperature and much 
of it is absorbed. 

Steamed Bread 

Stale bread may be steamed over water and served as soon as moist 
and puffed. Slices may be placed in a shallow pan over BOILING 
water and sufficient salted milk added to come halfway up the bread. 
Cover and steam until the bread is light and puffy but do not let it re- 
main until it breaks and is soggy. Grated cheese may be added to either 
of these dishes. 

SCALLOPED DISHES 

The term "scalloped dish" is supposed to have come from cooking 
a certain type of mixture in scallop shells. 

A scalloped dish is the combination of buttered crumbs and season- 
ing with uncooked or cooked material, to which may be added a sauce, 
milk, water or other liquid. These ingredients, arranged according to 
methods given below, are put into a baking dish and placed in the oven 
to brown the top layer of crumbs and either to cook or re-heat accord- 
ing to wether main ingredient be uncooked or cooked material. 

If main ingredient be cooked, use 3 min. test or a hot oven. If 
main ingredient be uncooked, use 4 min. test or a less hot oven, and 
cover during first half of baking time to prevent too rapid browning of 
crumbs. 

Always butter the baking dish and sprinkle with a few of the but- 
tered crumbs to prevent the materials from sticking. Individual dishes 
will require more crumbs on account of the greater surface. 

Method I. Where the material is dry, such as meat, fish, vege- 
tables, etc.. it is mixed with a sauce and seasoning, a few crumbs are 
placed on bottom of dish, the mixture is poured in, covered with the 
remainder of the crumbs, and baked. 

Method II. When the material will furnish its own moisture, as 
oysters, apples, rhubarb, etc., the ingredients are placed in the dish in 
two layers. Sprinkle the dish with crumbs, put in one layer of main 
ingredient, then part of dry seasonings, then one-half the remaining 



16 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

crumbs, and add the rest of materials in same order. If lemon juice is- 
used or a little liquid to start the cooking process, add before putting on 
the top layer of crumbs. Water soaked crumbs do not brown readily. 

Creamed Meat, Fish, Vegetables 

Cut cooked meat and vegetables into cubes, separate fish into large 
flakes. To each quart of well-seasoned material allow i pint of White 
Sauce, No. 2 and 3 c. buttered crumbs. Prepare according to Method I 
and bake about 20 minutes. This amount of sauce is just enough to hold 
the mixture together; another cupful may be used if desired. 

Tomatoes 

1 qt. tomatoes. 2 T. sugar. 

2 T. finely chopped onion. 2 T. butter. 

2 t. salt. 3 c. buttered crumbs. 

}i t. pepper. 

Cook the tomatoes and onions slowly in an uncovered saucepan for 
20 min., when there should be one pint of the mixture. Add the season- 
ing and prepare according to Method I, and bake about 20 min. 

Corn 

I pt. or I can corn or % t. pepper. 

2/3 c. dried corn. 2 T. butter. 

1/3 c. water. 1/3 c. milk. 

I t. salt. 2 c. buttered crumbs. 

Cook first five ingredients about 15 min. or until thick and the 
steam bubbles pufif up through, stir frequently to prevent burning. Add 
milk, prepare according to Method I, and bake about 20 min. The evap- 
oration of moisture and thickening of corn readily forms a sauce. Soak 
dried corn over night and cook in the same water until tender. 

Oysters 

I solid pt. oysters. -34 t. salt. 

1/16 t. cayenne. 3 c. buttered crumbs. 

Slip the oysters through the fingers to remove any bits of shell. 
Prepare according to Method II and bake uncovered about 20 min. or 
until the oysters turn white, and the gills curl and the crumbs are brown. 
Oysters cook so quickly that they come under the fat or oven tests for 
cooked material. 

Apples 

I qt. chopped tart apples. yg t. salt. 

I c. brown sugar. jA grated lemon rind. 

y2 t. cinnamon. 2 T. lemon juice. 

% t. cloves. 1/3 c. water. 

34 t. nutmeg. [ qt. buttered crumbs. 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 17 

Rhubarb 

I lb. or I solid qt. peeled, 1/3 c. stoned raisins, 

sliced rhubarb. 3 c. buttered crumbs. 

I c. brown sugar. 

Bananas 

8 bananas, scraped and sliced. % c. lemon juice. 

^ c. sugar. Ya, c. water. 

y^ t. salt. 3 c. buttered crumbs. 

Prepare the last three recipes according to Method II and general 
rules for uncooked mixtures, baking from Yx to i hr. All three make a 
good accompaniment to roast meats, the banana being especially good 
with lamb or mutton. These last three scalloped dishes may be made 
a little sweeter and served with a sauce for a desert. 

MEAT COOKERY 

General Rules 

In cooking meat one of three results must always be in mind ; to 
extract the juice, to retain the juice, or combine these two results. 

To retain the juice the meat is first seared by direct contact with 
the fire, or by placing it in a hot oven, hot pan or boiling water ; then 
the temperature is lowered. Searing coagulates the albumin on the out- 
side of the meat, and the latter is cooked in its own juice. 

To extract the juice, as in making soup, cut or chop the meat fine, 
exposing as large a surface as possible, and soak in cold water one hour 
or longer. 

To extract some of the juice in the broth and retain the rest in the 
meat as in making a stew, the pieces are not as small as for soup. They 
are allowed to remain in cold water only a few minutes and then heated 
slowly. While the meat is standing and heating the juice is drawn out; 
but when the water simmers the surface hardens and the remainder of 
the juice is retained. 

Stews 

Stewing is one of the best methods for cooking the toughter cuts 
of meat, such as the neck, shoulder, and lower part of the leg. If the 
flavor of browned meat is desired brown part of the material quickly, 
add to the remainder and cook according to directions for beef stew. 
In all cases keep the fire low, so that the stew will simmer and not boil, 
as high degree of heat will toughten the fibre. Stews may be flavored 
with all kinds of highly flavored vegetables, which should be added just 
in time to become tender. If the stew is to be the main part of the meal, 
greater food value may be obtained by adding potatoes, rice, barley, 



18 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 



macaroni, or other grain preparations. Dumplings of various types or 
baking powder biscuit may be served. 

Remade Dishes 

Meats which have been cooked need only to be well heated through, 
prolonged cooking hardens them. All gristle and superflous fat must 
be removed, and the meat may be cut into small pieces or chopped fine. 
Great pains should be taken to have made over dishes attractive in ap- 
pearance and properly seasoned. 

MEAT EXTENDERS 



Meat and Vegetable Soup — (see soups) 
Bee? and Mutton Stew 



1 to 2 lb. beef. 

2 T. finely chopped onion. 
Yz c. diced turnips. 

y^ c. diced carrots. 
2 c. potatoes cut in ^ in. 
Slices or cubes. 



2 t. salt. 

^4 t. pepper. 

Yy c. flour mixed with 

Yi c. cold water. 

I qt. water or 3 c. water and 

I c. tomatoes. 



Wipe the meat, remove fat, cut into i in. pices, put aside about 
one-fourth of the best pieces and put the remainder of the meat into 
the quart of liquid. Alelt the fat in a frying pan, remove the scraps, 
then brown the onion and remove, adding latter to the stew or discard- 
ing, according to taste. Take the meat put aside, roll it in flour and 
brown quickly in the hot fat : add this to stew, heat until it bubbles and 
simmer 2-3 hrs., or until the meat is nearly tender; then add the vege- 
tables and seasonings. Mix the flour with the Yz c. cold water, and 10 
min. before serving add slowly to the stew, stirring all the time until it 
thickens. Watch carefully that it does not scorch. Browning part 
of the meat is purely for flavor and color. This may be omitted. 



Chicken Stew 



5 lb. dressed fowl. 

Water. 

2 c. or I pt. small onions. 

I pt. can peas. 



Y2 c. flour. 

Vy_ c. chicken fat and drippings. 
Salt and peper to taste. 



Cook fowl until tender, adding onions and carrots the last hour. 
Remove chicken from bones, keeping the meat in as large pieces as pos- 
sible. Melt fat if hard or heat liquid fat until practically free from 
water. Stir in the flour, cook for an instant and add i qt. broth, stirring 
constantly as it thickens. Let the gravy boil for an instant, add other 
material, re-heat and serve. 



war-time cookery 19 

Rolled Steak 

I lb. top round ^ in. thick. i t. minced parsley, if convenient. 

I c. soft stale crumbs. Salt and pepper. 

I t. minced onion. ^ c. water or milk 

I T. drippings (melted). or enough to moisten. 

Mix the dressing and spread on the steak, keeping the mixture one 
inch from the edge to prevent squeezing out. Roll up the steak, tie 
securely, brown on all sides, put into kettle and surround with the fol- 
lowing vegetables 

^ c. each carrots, turnips, celery, and 2 T. chopped onion. Pour 
in hot vv-ater to come halfway up the steak, add salt and pepper, cover 
kettle tight, and simmer 2 to 3 hours or until tender. The vegetables 
may be left whole or pressed through a sieve to thicken the gravy. This 
will make six medium sized portions. 

Casserole Dishes 

The earthern casserole is well adapted to the "One-piece Dinner'' 
which consists of meat, potatoes and vegetables cooked together in a 
liquid which is thickened and forms the gravy at the time of serving. 
This type of dish saves much dish washing, as the meal is cooked and 
served in the casserole. Any fireproof covered earthern dish, crock, or 
bean pot, will answer the purpose but attractive casseroles of all sizes 
and descriptions may be purchased for a comparatively moderate sum. 

The cooking may be done in the fireless cooker or a moderate oven. 
When planning to use the oven for a length of time it is well to utilize 
the same heat for other dishes to be served at the same meal or some 
future time. Careful planning along this line saves much fuel and 
heat, as well as time and energy. 

General Directions 

Fowl, patridges, pigeons, small birds, beef, veal, rabbits, mutton 
chops, etc., may be cooked in a similar manner. Fowls, pigeons, rab- 
bits should be disjointed, steaks may be left whole or cut into round, 
oval or oblong strips. Any kind of fat may be used in the preliminary 
browning, and any vegetable combination made that seems desirable. 

Prepare meat, dip in flour or meal, and brown in a frying pan, if 
this flavor is liked, (the browning may be omitted). Put meat and 
vegetables into the dish in layers, or place the meat in the center with 
vegetables around. Cover the matrial with water, or the liquid used in 
cooking meat or vegetables. Use onion, bay leaf, parsley or any season- 
ing that blends with the ingredients and appeals to the family taste. 
Cover the casserole and place in a moderate oven from i^ to 3 hrs., 
according to toughness of meat. Dumplings may be cooked on top of 
the casserole dish the last 15 min. before serving. 



20 war-time cookery 

Meat Pies 

These may consist of various combinations of meats and vege- 
tables, with seasoning, heated in a gravy or thickened liquid, and cov- 
ered with a biscuit crust. Put cooked meat and vegetables in layers in 
a baking dish or mix all materials together. Cover with a thick hot 
gravy and put on the crust. If latter is in one piece, perforate the cen- 
ter. If the pie is large an inverted cup is sometimes placed in the center 
of the dish. The gravy will collect under this and prevent the liquid 
from forcing its way through the crust. Drop biscuit or those which 
have been patted and cut out may be used for the top of the pie. This 
is a convenience in serving and also allows plenty of space for the steam 
to escape during the cooking. 

MEAT AND POTATO MIXTURES 

General Proportions 

1 to 2 c. meat. i T. minced onion or parsley 

2 c. mashed potato. or both, if desired. 

3 T. drippings or butter substitute. Stock, water, or the water in 
Salt and pepper. which vegetables were cooked. 

Browned Hash 

Use I T. fat for greasing the pan or baking dish. Mix the ingred- 
ients, using just enough hot liquid to make the mixture hold together. 
Spread in a frying pan and cook over a moderate heat, so that the hash 
will brown and form a thick crust and yet not burn (it will take about 
20 min.). Fold like an omelet and serve on a hot platter. The same 
mixture may be made into small cakes and browned in the pan or put 
into a dish and re-heated and browned in the oven. 

Shepherds' Pie 

Mix everything except potato, and use only enough liquid to moist- 
en well. Put into a greased baking dish spread with potato, dot with 
fat, and re-heat and brown in a hot oven. The potato must be light 
and creamy but not very soft, else the juice from the meat will bubble 
up through. 

SuPRisE Potato Balls 

Use I qt. of seasoned potato to which has been added one beaten 
egg; be careful not to get the mixture too soft. Dampen the palm of 
the hand and flatten out some of the potato, making a large circle with 
a depression in the center. Put a little of the meat in the depression 
and, bring the edges of the potato together, making a ball with the meat 
inside. Brush heavily with drippings or other fat, roll in fine dried 
crumbs and re-heat and brown in hot oven. These balls may be covered 
with egg and crumbs and cooked in deep fat. Makes ten balls. 



war-time cookery 21 

Other Varations 

Use the potato and egg mixture, form into balls, make a depression 
in the center, re-heat and brown in a hot oven and fill with creamed 
meat, fish, eggs, or vegetables. The potato might form a border around 
a platter or be put through a pastry bag and tube with the creamed 
material in the center. 

Into a baking dish or casserole put alternate layers of chopped or 
ground meat and chopped or mashed potato. Pour tomato sauce or 
gravy over each layer of meat. Cover with buttered crumbs, re-heat 
and brown. 

Cooked macaroni, spaghetti, rice, hominy grits, cream of wheat, 
etc., may be substituted for potato in many of these recipes, and fish 
may be used for the meat. 

Meat With Macaroni or Spaghetti or Rice 

2 c. well seasoned meat. 

2 c. macaroni or i c. rice cooked in salted water (this will make 
4 c. cooked). 

3 c. thickened tomatoes (strained or unstrained). 

Chop the meat as fine as hamburg steak, mix ingredients, and 
serve very hot. If the meat is uncooked it may be tossed about in a pan 
a few minutes or added unbrowned to the other materials, and the dish 
placed in the oven for half an hour. There are countless variations of 
the above ingredients, and the housekeeper may evolve a dozen recipes 
by adding difi:erent seasonings to the three materials given. 

Suggestions 

Add ^ c. chopped onion or 2 green peppers, or both. 

Add I T. curry powder or less. 

Add Chili powder to taste (made from Chili pepper). 

Use savory fat in making tomato sauce (fat which has been tried 
out in a double boiler and mixed with thyme, onion, or other season- 
ings. ) 

Sprinkle ^ to i c. grated cheese on top of the dish. 

Steamed Potato or Rice and Meat Mold 

Use twice as much potato or rice as meat. Brush a bowl or mold 
very heavily with fat and line with potato or rice pressing it firmly 
against the sides. If the spoon is dipped into cold water before pressing 
the material the latter is not so apt to stick to spoon. Fill the center 
with well seasoned, slightly moist meat and cover with potato or rice. 
Cover mold and steam ^ hour to re-heat. Turn out the form and pour 
tomato sauce around and not over it. The mold may be in a pan of 
boiling water in the oven, or heated in a kettle of water directly over the 
flame. In this case put a rack perforated pan, or several flolds of paper 
on the bottom of the kettle to prevent the mold from bumping. 



22 war-time cookery 

Surprise Cabbage 

1 c. chopped raw mutton or 2 t. salt, >^ t. pepper, 
other meat. Onion or herbs if desired. 

2 T. fat. I head of cabbage (large leaves). 
1/3 c. raw rice. 

Separate cabbage leaves, and throw into boiling water and cook a 
few minutes until the leaves have wilted and will roll without breaking. 
Mix the remaining materials and allow i rounding teaspoonful for each 
leaf. Put the mixture in the center of the leaf, fold over the sides, roll 
up and fasten with toothpicks. Pack in dish, cover with water or liquid 
from vegetables, and bake in oven or simmer over the fire ilA hours. 
If spiced meat or sausage is used the seasoning may be omitted. 

Meat Rolls and Turnovers 

Small quantities of mutton, beef, chicken or ham may be utilized 
for these. The meat should be well seasoned and moist enough to form 
into rolls about the size of the finger, or oval cakes. Make a short cake 
dough, roll out thin and cut into strips, or circles about the size of a 
large saucer. Place the rolls on the strips or the ovals on the circles. 
Moisten the edges of the dough so they will stick together, fold the 
paste over the meat and pinch. The meat should be entirely covered. 
Bake 20 to 30 min. in a hot oven ,and serve as soon as done. 

Farmers Bulletin 391 — Economical Use of Meat in the Home. 

Corn-Meal Mush With Meat 

I lb. lean meat. ^^ t. sage with pork. 

I c. meal. Water. 

I t. salt or more. 

Simmer the meat until very tender. Cut fine or chop. Reduce the 
broth to I qt. or add water to make this amount, see that it is very well 
seasoned. To the boiling broth very slovv^ly add the meal, stirring all the 
time. Cook directly over the fire until thick and the steam bubbles puflf 
up through. Finish in double boiler or fireless cooker. Add the meat, 
pour into greased bread tins, and cool. Cut into slices and brown. Odds 
and ends of cooked meats may be combined for this dish and the broth 
may be made from bouillon cubes or the water in which vegetables have 
been cooked.

P' ( Codfish, Mackerel, Finnan Haddie or Smoked Halibut) 

Soak in cold water to remove some of the salt. Place in cold water, 
heat gradually, and cook below boiling point until fish is tender. Place 
fish on a hot platter and over it pour i pt. white sauce. Place boiled 
potatoes at one end and boiled beets or carrots at the other. Season 
the vegetables with salt, pepper, and butter or substitute. 

Creamed Fish 

2 c. flaked fish. i to i^ c. medium white sauce. 

Combine materials and serve with potatoes, rice, on toast, in bread, 
or hominy cases. Two hard-cooked eggs cut in cubes and chopped pars- 
ley make pleasing additions. This serves six. 

Codfish Balls 

I c. salt codfish. Salt if needed. 

2^2 c. potatoes. i T. butter or substitute. 

y& t. pepper. i egg. 

If fish is very dry and salt, soak in cold water for several hours, 
otherwise just wash in cold water and separate into small pieces. Wash, 
pare and slice potatoes, and cook in boiling water, when they are nearly 
done, add the fish. When the potatoes are cooked, drain the mixture 
very thoroughly and shake over the fire until dry and the potatoes look 
mealy. Mash v/ith wire potato masher, add the butter, pepper, and 
more salt if needed. When partially cool, add as much of the beaten 
t.gg as necessary to make the mixture soft and creamy and yet retain 
its shape when formed into balls. Take up the mixture by spoonfuls, 
mould slightly, and slip into the fat. 

Or shape into balls and roll in flour or meal. 

Or egg and crumb before frying. 

I c. of cold cooked fish may be mixed with the warm mashed pota- 
toes instead of using the salt codfish. This mixture may be baked in a 
rather hot oven, or browned in a frying pan. This makes eight cro- 
quettes. 

EGGS 

Tests For Freshness 

If fresh, they will sink to the bottom of a pan of water; a stale egg 
will rise. The shell of a freshly laid egg is slightly rough. In a dark 
room hold the egg between the eye and a lighted candle ; dark spots are 
an indication of deterioration. 

Eggs should always be washed before using. If the whites only 
are used the yolks may be kept from hardening by covering with water

Serve on toast or in rice or potato nests with cheese or tomato 
sauce. 

Hard Cooked Eggs 

Cut four eggs into eights and mix with i c. medium white or toma- 
to sauce. 

Combine eggs with macaroni and white sauce. Use 4 eggs, i^ c. 
sauce and 2 c. cooked macaroni. Rice may be used, also buttered 
crumbs for the top. Yi to i pt. oysters may be partially cooked and 
substituted for eggs. 

Daisy Eggs 

6 eggs, I c. thick white sauce, 8 slices of bread. Cut the bread 
pointed at one end to represent a daisy petal, and toast. Sprinkle yolks 
with salt and pepper and press through a sieve. Chop whites fine and 
add to sauce. Place toast in a circle with points out and cover with 
sauce, being careful it does not run off. Pile yolks in center and place 
parsley between each petal. Square pieces of toast may be used, the 
white mixture put on top and the yolks sprinkled over this. Boiled rice 
or cold cereal sliced and browned may be used for a foundation.

whites. Pour the mixture into a greased frying pan and cook over mod- 
erate heat until set. Fold omelet over, rolling at right angles to the pan 
handle ; turn out on a hot platter, and serve. This omelet is more ten- 
der then when no sauce is used and a little harder to fold. The mixture 
may be baked in a moderate oven and served from the dish, (time 20 
to 30 min.).

H t. salt. 3 eggs. 

Soak bread crumbs in milk 15 min. add yolks and seasoning, and 
fold in the whites. Melt fat in frying pan and pour in the mixture. 
Cook slowly until under part is brown then set in the oven for a few 
minutes to dry the top. Fold and serve on a hot platter. 

1/2 c. cold rice may be used in place of cereal although this will 
make a little firmer omelet. This makes four to six portions. 

CHEESE 

Cheese is rich in protein and fat and this fact should be kept in 
mind when planning meals. There is another point to be considered in 
combining cheese with other foods. Whether raw or cooked it is in 
rather compact form and seems to demand crusty rolls, toast, crack- 
ers, macaroni and such substances which call for thorough mastication 
and separation of the food particles. 

Cheese Dishes and Their Preparation 

For convenience they might be grouped as follows : 

1. Cheese dishes which may serve as main part of the meal. 

2. Cheese additions to soup and vegetables. 

3. Cheese salads, sandwiches and similar dishes. 

4. Cheese pastry, sweets, etc. 

Variety may be obtained in recipes by change of flavorings. Among 
the best flavorings are onion, chives, and the ordinary green pepper, 
mustard, curry powder, and Chili powder. 

In preparing cheese it is more convenient to use a coarse grater 
having slits instead of holes. This really shaves the cheese, and this is 
an advantage as the greater does not become clogged. For rarebits and 
all dishes where the cheese should melt quickly and evenly, it may be 
chopped or sliced thin. 

As cheese is rich in protein and fat little or no fat and water or 
skimmed milk may be used in many recipes which call for a large 
amount of cheese. 

Approximately, one ounce of cheese is equivalent to i egg, to a 
glass of milk, or 2 oz. of meat.

hours. Put the bag under the faucet and let the cold water run over the 
cheese to wash away any whey which clings to the curd, as this is the 
acid part. Hang up the bag for a few minutes, then squeeze gently to 
remove the water. Put the cheese into bowl, season with salt and mix 
with a little cream or melted butter if desired. Shape into balls or mould 
and keep in a cold place. The milk may be heated slowly in a double 
boiler until the whey rises to the top, the latter poured off and the curd 
drained as above. The curd is much harder and dryer prepared this 
way. Fancy perforated moulds may be used in place of the bag. 

Macaroni and Cheese 

I c. macaroni (2 c. cooked). ^'^ to i c. grated cheese. 

I c. sauce No. II. i c. buttered crumbs.

without the slightest resistance, turn into a colander or sieve and let 
cold water run through it to prevent the pieces from adhering to each 
other. Make a white sauce, add the cheese and macaroni, mix well, 
pour into buttered dish, cover with the crumbs and place in the oven to 
re-heat mixture and brown crumbs. The crumbs may be omitted and 
small pieces of cheese sprinkled over the surface. The macaroni and 
cheese may be put into the dish in layers and hot milk poured over the 
mixture. 

2 c. cooked spaghetti, rice, big hominy, hominy grits or other mild 
flavored grain may be substituted for the macaroni, and tomato sauce 
for the white sauce. This makes six to eight portions.

RECIPES FOR USING LEGUMES 

{Beans, Peas, Lentils, Peanuts) 
Boston Baked Beans 

I pt. pea beans. }4 t. mustard. 

1 to 2 t. salt. ■ }i t. pepper (scant). 

2 T. molasses. J/4 lb. salt pork. 

Pick over beans, cover with cold water, and soak overnight. Drain, 
cover with cold water, add a pinch of soda, bring to the boiling point 
and parboil 20 min., or until the skins slip off easily. Drain. Scrape 
and scald pork rind and cut through the rind every half inch. Mix 
the molasses and seasoning with a little boiling water. 

Put the beans into the bean pot or crock and bury the pork all ex- 
cept the rind. Add liquid and sufficient boiling water to cover the 
beans. Cover the crock and bake slowly for six or eight hours. Un- 
cover during the last hour, so that the pork rind may become crisp. 
While the beans are baking more water may have to be added. 

Some people like the flavor of a little minced onion and some 
tomato cooked with the beans. Oils and other fats may be substituted 
for the pork but will not give quite the same flavor. Other varieties of 
beans as well as dried peas may be prepared in the same manner. The 
beans may be baked in a shallow pan and the molasses omitted. These 
beans are drier and more broken than the others. This serves twelve. 

Loaf — (Any of the Legumes) 

I pt. cooked beans, etc. W^ater, tomato juice or 

I ot. stale crumbs. other liquid. 

I T. or more, onion. i egg. 

Combine ingredients adding sufficient liquid to hold the mixture 
together. Put into a greased pan and bake about 30 min.

Peanut Loaf 

I c. chopped nuts. i Qgg. 

I pt. well seasoned mashed potato. J/2 c. milk. 

I T. onion or parsley, if liked. 

Combine ingredients and put into pan. Bake about 20 min. More 
peanuts may be used. Six portions. 

Hot Bean Custard 

I c. bean pulp. i c. milk. 

Any seasoning desired. 2 eggs. 

Beat eggs until mixed but not foamy ; add milk and gradually add 
this to the pulp of beans which have been pressed through a sieve. The 
mixture must be quite highly seasoned or it is insipid. Pour into greased 
dish and set in a pan of luke-warm water, which should come as high 
on the outside of the moulds as the mixture is inside. See that the 
water does not boil, or the custard will over cook. 

Test — A clean, dry knife inserted gently in the center should come 
out without anything adhering to it if the custard is cooked. It will 
take about 25 min. for small moulds. Turn out on a platter and place 
well seasoned macaroni around the custard. Tomato sauce may be 
served with the dish. 

Polenta 

4 c. white cooked beans. Salt and pepper, 

i^ T. molasses. 2 t. vinegar. 

j4 t. mustard. 

Mash the beans and mix with the other ingredients. Form into 
cakes and brown on both sides. 

Mexican FrijolES (Mexican Beans) 

1 pt. beans (or use kidney beans). % c. minced onion. 

2 T. lard. 5 green Chilies. 

I tomato or y^ c. solid pulp. i t. Chili powder. 

I t. salt. 

After cooking the beans should measure 3 pts. Melt the fat in a 
frying pan, add part of the beans and mash just a few; repeat. Cook 
the other ingredients just long enough to make a paste. Turn the beans 
into serving dish and spread the sauce over the beans before serving. 
The materials should be unevenly mixed. This serves twelve. 

Kidney Bean Stew 

I c. beans. i pt. water. 

54 c. celery or y^ t. 2 T. drippings. 

Celery salt. i pt. diced potatoes. 

54 c. onions. i T. salt. 
I pt. tomatoes. 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 31 

Soak the beans overnight, cut celery into half inch pieces, chop 
onion. Put the ingredients into a kettle and simmer 3 or 4 hours. Half 
an hour before serving add the fat and more seasoning if necessary. 
There should be very little liquid at the end. if there is, thicken it a lit- 
tle. Canned beans may used ; in this case use only i c. water. 

Bean Salads 

Beans of all kinds make very acceptable salads if well seasoned. 
Celery, onion, and pimentoes are flavors which blend well with the 
beans. If fresh celery is not convenient, celery seed may be used.

BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

Flour Mlxtures 

Flour — Use a flour containing a large percentage of gluten for all 
yeast work, as this will make a larger loaf because of the elasticity of 
the gluten. Use a Winter wheat or pastry flour for all other batters awd 
doughs. Bread can be made from a soft flour but requires dilTerent 
"handling. To convert a strong bread flour into a soft flour for cake 
and pastry work, substitute 2 T. cornstarch for two T. flour in every 
cupful used. Always measure flour after sifting, as this will make a 
great difl'erence in the results. It is well to keep a jar of sifted flour on 
hand in order to save time. 

Fat — Butter, butter substitutes, drippings, hardened vegetable fats, 
and oils may be used. Since butter is about 85 percent fat and the hard- 
ened vegetable fats, and oils are approximately 100 percent, use 2 T. 
less to the cupful when these are substituted for butter. Clarified chic- 
ken fat contains about the same amount of water as butter, and there- 
fore may replace the latter, cupful for cupful. Thin cream is equiva- 
lent to % c. fat and ^. c. milk. Whipping cream (40 percent) is equiv- 
alent to a scant ^ c. fat and full ^ c. milk. For each cupful of nuts 
used decrease the fat i^ T. When unsalted fats are used allow i t. 
salt for each cupful. 

Siveetening — This material may be sugar, brown sugar, molasses, 
honey, corn syrup. It takes approximately i 1/3 c. of powdered or 
brown sugar lightly measured to replace i c. granulated sugar, i c. 
molasses sweetens about as much as -14 c. sugar ; i c. corn syrup would 
be equivalent to a little more than ^ c. sugar. For this reason when the 
last two are used recipes often call for a little sugar to give the sweet 
taste to v,'hich we are accustomed, \\n.ien the syrups are substituted 
for sugar use a little less liquid. 

Liquids — Skimmed milk contains some solid material, therefore 
when substituting water use 2 T. less for each cupful. If sour milk is 



32 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

used to replace sweet milk use >^ t. soda for each cupful of milk. Y^ t, 
soda will replace approximately i>4 t. baking powder. For sour cream 
see discussion of fats. 

Leavening Agents — Sour milk, molasses, fruit, and chocolate all 
contain acid substitutes. Use ^ t. soda for each cupful of sour milk; 
I t. for each cupful of molasses ; i t. soda to approximately 2^ t. of 
cream of tartar; i t. soda with the proper acid to replace approximately 
3 t. baking powder. Use i t. baking powder for each cupful of flour 
when eggs are utilized ; use 2 t. when none are used. When buckwheat, 
cornmeal, barley meal, etc., are substituted for flour, increase the bak- 
ing powder a trifle. When eggs are omitted from a recipe increase the 
baking powder about y^ t. for each egg. If more soda is used in a flour 
mixture than is needed to offset the acid, a yellow color and peculiar 
taste results. The excess of soda will combine with fat to give a pun- 
gent, biting flavor. 

Bggs — Eggs thin a mixture when raw and thicken when cooked. 
Too intense heat will toughten eggs ; therefore sponge cakes especially 
require a moderate oven. 

Approximate Proportions for Batters and Doughs 

I c. liquid to i c. flour makes a batter that will pour from a spoon. 
I c. liquid to 2 c. flour makes a batter that will drop from a spoon. 
I c. liquid to 3 c. flour makes a soft dough that can be handled. 
I c. liquid to 4 c. flour makes a stiff dough that can be rolled. 

General Rules 

Flours vary in the amount of moisture which they require so that 
the consistency of batters or mixtures containing leavening agents, 
sugar, etc., should always be regulated by leaving out or adding liquid, 
never by varying the flour, because this makes all the other dry mater- 
ials wrong, as these are proportionate to the flour used. 

Mix and sift the dry ingredients. Beat the eggs without separat- 
ing, and add part of the milk to them. Make a hollow or well in the 
center of the dry mixture, add the liquid slowly gradually working in 
the flour, and keep the same consistency all the way through the pro- 
cess. Always reserve a little of the milk until sure it will be needed. 
When a flaky texture is desired as in baking-powder biscuits, always 
cut the fat into the flower, otherwise melt it and add at the last. 

Arrange the fire, dishes for mixing, pans for baking and measure 
everything before beginning to put the material together. Work quick- 
ly, mix thoroughly, and bake at once all mixtures containing baking 
powders, or other leavening agents. In a coal range, bake first on the 
floor of the oven and then put the biscuit, etc., on the shelf to brown; 
in a gas range, bake in the center of the oven. 



WAR-TIMU COOKERY 35 

POPOVERS 

2 c. flour (part white, part 2 eg:;;s. 

entire wheat or rye). 2 c. mi^k. 

3^ t. salt. 

Use iron gem pans or earthern cups for baking, and place them in 
the oven to heat while mixing the ingredients. Grease cups after heat- 
ing. Mix the materials according to rule and beat hard with an egg 
beater just before pouring into the cups, which should not be over half 
full. Put immediately into a very hot oven and bake 30 to 45 min. 
Lower the heat during the last half of the baking. The secret of good 
popovers is in having hot cups, a hot oven, and not opening the door for 
10 min., as most of the puffing is due to change of moisture into steam. 
This makes nine to ten popovers. 

Griddle Cakes 

2 c. flour. I egg. 

Yo t. salt. I to 2 T. fat (melted). 

3 t. baking powder. tJ/ c. milk, or milk and water. 

Mix according to rule and cook at once. Do not beat the mixture 
each time before baking as this drives ofif the gas formed from the bak- 
ing powder. Part rye or entire wheat flour may be used. Sour milk 
may be used substituting .)4 t. soda for baking powder. If the sour 
milk cakes are made a little thicker, they are very good without the fat. 
3/2 to I c. cooked rice may be softened in the milk. (With these cakes 
use 4 t. baking powder. ) 

The griddle or waffle iron should be heated slowly and be hot 
enough to evaporate instantly water sprinkled on it. Put a piece of 
hard fat on a fork and grease irons well but do not leave little pools of 
fat to burn and smoke. Pour batter upon the griddle from the end 
of a spoon or a pitcher in order to make round cakes. As soon as the 
bubbles begin to appear all over, but before they break through the 
surface, turn the cakes. Turn but once, otherwise they will be heavy. 

Waffles 

Use the griddle cake mixture with 2 eggs. Separate eggs ; beat 
whites stiff and cut into the batter the last thing. Do not fill the iron 
more than half full, or the batter will run out. Cook one minute on 
each side and keep turning until the waffles are crisp. 

Bread Griddle Cakes 

lyi c. fine stale crumbs. i egg. 

lYi c. milk. >< c. flour. 

I to 2 T. fat. 2 t. baking powder. 

^ t. salt. 



34 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

Heat the milk, put in the bread and fat, cover, and let stand 15 
min., or until the bread is soft. Mash well or press through a coarse 
sieve. Add the beaten eggs and pour the mixture into the dry ingred- 
ients which have been sifted together. 

Corn Meal Cakes 

14 c. meal. ! S t. salt. 

2 c. liquid. ::; t baking powder. 

1 egg. H c. flour. 

Heat milk in double boiler, add the meal, and cook 5 min. W'hen 
cool add the beaten egg, and combine mixtures. 

Muffins — (Standard Proportions) 

2 c. flour. I Qgg- 

1 t. salt. I c. milk. ( ?) 

4 t. baking powder. 4 T. fat (melted) 

Use sufficient liquid to make a very soft drop batter, almost a pour 
batter. Bake 20 to 25 min. in a moderate oven. 

Variations — Substitute -;4 c. cooked barley, rice, oatmeal, hominy- 
grits, or dried crumbs for 34 c. of the flour. These mufiins will be a 
little more moist after baking than the wheat mufiins. 

Omit the egg, use 5 t. baking powder and ^ to i c. corn meal, rye 
meal, crushed rolled oats, etc. Put materials together very quickly, 
and place in the oven at once. This mixture may be baked in a shallow 
pan and cut into squares. The corn meal mixture is especially nice 
when crusty. Sour milk and soda may also be utilized. Ten to twelve 
muffins. 

Bran Muffins 

13^2 c. bran. i egg. 

i^A c. flour. y^ c. molasses. 

2 t. salt. I c. sour milk. 
^ t. soda. 

Sift the soda and salt with the flour, and mix thoroughly with the 
bran. Mix egg with molasses and pour into the center of the dry in- 
gredients. As you begin to n.iix the materials, pour in the milk rapidly. 
This mixture must be a drop batter and look spongy when put into the 
pans. The egg may be omitted and the batter made a trifle thicker. 
Bake 40 min. in a moderate oven. One dozen mufiins. 

Bkown Bread 

2 c. rye meal. i t. salt. 

I c. yellow conmieal. jA c. molasses. 

y2 T. soda.' I pt. sour milk. 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 35 

Mix the meals but do not sift as this removes the bran. Sift soda 
and salt together to remove any lumps and blend thoroughly with the 
meals. Make a well in the center, pour in the molasses and rapidly 
add the milk, mixing the ingredients quickly. (Soft drop batter). Fill 
well greased molds 2./-^^ full and steam 4 hours. This may be baked in 
muffin tins 45 min. 

Spoon Bread 

I c. soft white or Southern meal. r c. boiling water. 

1 T. sweetening. 2 eggs. 

2 t. salt. T c. sour milk. 
2 T. fat. y. t. soda. 

Put the first four ingredients into a bowl and over them pour the 
boiling water. When cooled add the beaten eggs and milk. Dissolve 
the soda in i T. cold water, add to the mixture and beat in quickly and 
thoroughly. Bake 30 min. in a moderate oven. Sweet milk and 2 t. 
baking powder may be used, sprinkling the powder over the top and 
beating well. Half a cupful of cooked rice or hominy grits may be 
added to the dish. 

Fritters 

2c flour. I c. milk. (?) 

2 t. baking pov.'der. 2 T. fat. 

■' Qgg. I c. chopped clams, apple or corn. 

This is really a fried muffin mixture made a little stiffer than for 
baking. Drain clams well, remove black portion, chop fine. Add the 
last thing and use a scant amount of salt in the batter. The mixture 
should be rather a thick drop batter. Drop into hot fat which will 
brown a piece of stale bread in i min. When cooked, a fork or knit- 
ting needle stuck into the fritter should come out clean. 

Fat for frying may be lard, suet, the various cottonseed products, 
corn or peanut oil. A mixture of hard and soft fats, such as chicken 
and suet, makes a good combination. Lard and suet smoke and de- 
compose at a much lower temperature than the cottonseed products, and 
much more of the former is absorbed in cooking. Care in heating and 
clarifying also determines the number of times fat can be used. 

Tests for Hot Fat — Materials already cooked or requiring little 
cooking need hotter fat than those which are uncooked. When a cube 
of bread brov.'ns in 60 seconds the fat 's riT;ht for bitters. Use a forty 
second test for articles to be re-heated and brow^ned. Use a 20 second 
test for fried potatoes or cold wet. rt-"^ooked foods, r-^rticularly if pre- 
pared in large amounts, as they cool the fat considerably. 



36 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

Biscuits — (Standard Proportions) 

2 c. flour. 2 to 4 T. fat. 

I t. salt. H c. milk or water. (?) 

4 t. baking powder. 

Work the fat into the dry ingredients. Add the liquid steadily, 
trying not to moisten the same portion twice. Toss out onto a floured 
board and pat or roll out gently. Cut into rounds and moisten the top 
with milk or fat to help brown. Bake 12 to 15 min. in a hot oven. 

Variations 

Short Cake 

Use the full amount of fat. Roll thin making the shape of the 
pan, or cut into large circles if for individual cakes. Bake, split, and 
butter, spread with fruit and sprinkle with sugar. 

Fruit Roees 

Roll dough half an inch thick keeping it oblong in shape. Spread 
with butter substitute, but do not go too near the edges, lest it will 
squeeze out. Sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon and any dried f riut. 
Beginning the narrow way roll up like a jelly roll. Cut off slice i in. 
thick, place in muffin tins or in a round cake tin with the cut surfaces up 
and down. Bake 15 to 20 min., depending upon the size of rolls and 
closeness together in pan. 

Egg Roles 
Use one beaten egg and less liquid. Cut into long narrow strips. 

Baked AppeE Dumpeing 

Roll the dough as thin as for pie crust and cut into four or five 
inch squares. In the center of each, place sliced apple and sprinkle with 
sugar, and cinnamon or nutmeg and a speck of salt. Fold the corners 
together, pinching the edges to prevent juice from escaping. The edges 
may be moistened with water. Bake about 20 min. and serve with 
liquid sauce. 

Drop or Emergency Biscuit 

Make the mixture a little softer and drop on greased tins allowing 
room to spread. These also make a good eggless muffin. 

Apple Cake 

Use I egg and sufficient milk to make a stiff drop batter. Spread 
in a greased pan, and press the sharp edges of sliced apples down into 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 37 

the batter. Sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar, and bake 20 to 
30 min. Eat with butter or serve with a sauce. 

Currents, raisins, or chopped cooked orange peel may be mixed 
with the dough. 

^ c. corn meal, rolled oats, or mashed potato may be substituted 
for that amount of flour. All three of these are a little more compact 
than the all flour mixture and should stand five minutes before going 
into the oven. They should begin to rise a little before baking. 

Steamed Dumpeings 

Use 2 T. fat and 2 t. baking powder. Cut over into biscuit shape, 
or drop by spoonfuls on top of a stew, or steam over water. Keep 
closely covered or the dumplings will fall. 

Baking Powder Breads 

Use 2 t. baking powder and i T. or no fat. Make a drop batter 
and put into a bread tin. Let the mixture stand 15 min. before baking. 
Bake about 45 min. in a moderate oven. ^ c. sweetening and chopped 
orange peel or other fruit may be added if desired. Chopped nuts make 
a pleasing change. Part rye flour may be used, or all graham flour. 
Sour milk may be substituted for sweet milk, using Vz t. soda for each 
cupful milk. 

Spice Cake 

Add y^ c. molasses, ^4 c. sugar, i t. cinnamon, ^ t. cloves, and 
use the full amount of fat. Make a soft drop batter and bake in small 
tins. Work very quickly and get the mixture into the oven at once

I c. seeded raisins. i c. corn flour. 

J/2 t. salt. 4 t. baking powder or 

I t. cinnamon. i t. soda if molasses is used. 

If corn flour is unobtainable, use graham or whole wheat. All 
graham may be substituted. Boil everything but the flour and leaven 
for 3 min. When the mixture is cool add the last two ingredients sifted 
together. This should be a stiff drop batter. Bake in a pan with a tube

I c. unsweetened apple sauce. t c. raisins or other fruit. 

3/2 t. salt. vSoda. 

I t. cinnamon. 

Soften or slightly melt the fat and add the sweetening. Add al- 
ternately the apple sauce and dry ingredients. Add the raisins last, 
using a little of the flour for coating them. This also is a stiff drop 
batter. Bake in same manner as Eggless, Butterless cake. If the sugar 
is used add only i t. soda for that, the sauce, and the raisins. If mo- 
lasses is substituted, use i^ t. soda.

I T. fat. rlA c. flour. 

1-3 c. sugar or other sweetening. i t. 'diking powder. 

1 ^gg- ^2 c. liquid. 

y^ t. salt. Any flavoring desired. 

Melt the fat and add the sugar as well as you can. Add the egg 
and beat thoroughly to partially dissolve the sugar. Add alternately the 
sifted dry materials and the liquid. Make a pour batter, and bake 15 ta 
20 min. in small tins or 30 min. in a loaf. Serve with a sauce. The 
cake drys quickly, so it is better eaten the day it is baked. 

Chocolate Cake 

3/2 c. fat. iVj t. baking powder.

2 eggs. .j-j c. shaved chocolate or 

^ c. sour milk. y^ c. chocolate dissolved in 

I t. vanilla. ^A c. l^oiling water. 

Mix in the usual manner adding the cool chocolate after the eggs. 
Cocoa has about half as much fat as chocolate ; so if former is used the 
fat may be increased a trifle. This mixture makes a very soft drop 
batter, almost a pour batter. If more liquid is needed use sweet milk 
or water. Bake in shallow pan about half an hour. Chocolate burns 
readily, so lower the heat during the last part of the time.

^our, and rolled oats. This should be a stiff drop batter. Drop by 
teaspoonfuls on a greased tin, allowing plenty of room to spread. 
I{.aisins, currants, or nuts could be added, using 3^^ c. of any one of 
.these. Cooked, chopped orange or lemon peel gives a change of flavor. 

BREAD 

The gluten of wheat is a mixture of substances which, when mixed 
with liquid, makes an elastic mass. When gas is formed in the dough, 
the latter will rise and expand until it reaches a breaking poin.t Good 
bread flour has the right kind and amount of gluten. In general, spring 
wheats have more of this property, although a hard winter wheat may 
be used. 

Rye flour has less of this elastic quality, and therefore is unsatis- 
factory for use alone. It is impossible to make light bread from corn 
meal alone. Even those breads made by combining corn with wheat 
or rye cannot be handled like breads made from wheat. The process 
is much shorter. The bread may be mixed, kneaded, and placed in a 
deep pan at once, and baked as soon as light. Or, it may be made into 
<a very stiff' dough at once (since it softens as it rises) and then light 
worked just enough to shape into loaves. If possible, pans should be 
;so placed in the oven that air will circulate around them. If they touch 
»each other or the sides of the oven, the loaves of bread will rise uneven- 
ly and be unsightly. If the oven is crowded, it may be necessary to 
change the position of the pans occasionally to insure well shaped 
loaves. 

Mashed potatoes may be used in bread, and every pound of mash- 
•ed potato contains about 1% c. water and starch, etc., equivalent to 
those substances in i c. wheat flour. Doughs containing a large amount 
of potato must be very stiff, since the potato contains water which will 
cause the dough to soften as it ferments. 

General Rules 

If milk is used, scald to prevent souring. Liquid should be luke- 
"warm for best growth of yeast. If too warm it will kill the yeast and 
make flour pasty; if too cold it will retard the growth of the yeast. The 
temperature of a warm room is right for the dough, and an even tem- 
perature will produce the best results. 



war-time; cookery 41 

An ordinary sized loaf of bread should bake i hour. Whole wheat, 
Tye bread, etc., should cook a little longer. The oven at first should be 
hot enough to brown a piece of heavy white paper, or i t. flour in 5 
:min. The heat should increase during the first quarter of the time, 
remain constant the next two quarters, and decrease the last quarter. 
Rolls, being smaller, require a hotter oven. When bread is baked, re- 
move from pan and cool on a rack, if a crusty loaf is liked. If soft 
crust is desired, brush with liquid or fat, or wrap in a clean cloth when 
the loaves are partially cooled. 

Put sweetening, salt, potato, squash, etc., and fat in bowl and pour 
in hot liquid. When the mixture is lukewarm, add softened yeast and 
sufficient flour to make a sponge (soft drop batter) ; it will take between 
one half and two thirds of full amount. Beat hard for a few minutes, 
-cover and let double in bulk. Then add sufficient flour to enable the 
•dough to be handled. Turn out onto a floured board and knead until 
smooth and elastic. It should rebound under the pressure of the fin- 
ger; also stop sticking to the board. Put into a greased or moistened 
bowl and grease or moisten the top in the same manner to prevent a 
crust from forming. When doubled in bulk separate into pieces for 
the loaves and knead to break up large bubbles and make fine grained. 
When the dough is light bake. 

The making of the sponge may be omitted, although this 
hastens the process, and the materials mixed and kneaded in the be- 
ginning and later shaped. 

Salt has a tendency to retard the fermentation, so if the sponge 
method is used, the salt may be added with the second lot of flour. It 
is a good plan to measure salt and put it on top of the sponge so it will 
-not be forgotten. 

Wheat Bread 

2 c. liquid. 2 t. salt. 

I T. sweetening. ^ to i yeast cake. 

I T. fat. 6 c. flour (about). 

Prepare according to the general rule for bread made with a 
sponge or the straight dough method. This will make two loaves. 

Potato Bread 

Use from Yz to 2c. mashed potato. If the larger amount is used 
leave out Yz c. liquid, and make the dough a little stiffer than for the 
plain bread. 

Squash Bread 
Follow recipe for wheat bread using i^ c. liquid and Yi c. squash.

Whole Wheat Bread 

2 c. liquid. Ya to I yeast cake. 

2 to 4 T. molasses. 3 c. flour. ( ? ). 

2 t. salt. 3 c. whole wheat. ( ?). 
I to 2 T. fat. 

When fl^ours are used in combination always make the sponge with 
the white flour. 

Rye Bread . 

Substitute rye flour for whole wheat in the above recipe. Half 
rye flour may be used although a lighter and more satisfactory loaf 
results when one-third rye is used. 

Crumb Bread 

Same ingredients as for whole wheat bread, using t c. dried 
ground crumbs and 4^ to 5 c. flour. Soak crumbs in hot liquid for 
15 min. and proceed according to rule. 

Barley Bread 

54 c. pearl barley or 2 t. salt. 

1 c. after cooking. 1 to 2 T. fat. 

2 c. liquid. 74 to i yeast cake. 
2 T. sweetening. 4 to 5 c. flour. 

Oatmeal Bread 

Same ingredients as for whole wheat bread, using i c. rolled oats,, 
and about 4 c. flour. Soak the oatmeal in hot liquid for 15 min. Or, 
use 2 c. hot oatmeal mush and no other liquid. 

Corn Meal Bread 

Yz to I c. cornmeal. 2 t. salt. 

2 c. liquid. Y\ to i yeast cake. 

2 T. sweetening. 3 to 4 c. flour. 
I to 2 T. fat. 

I c. meal makes a very moist loaf of bread and many prefer the 
smaller amount. Cook the meal in the liquid in a double boiler. After 
15 min. add sweetening, fat, and salt. When the mixture is lukewarm 
add the yeast and flour. Make a stiff dough and put directly into 
greased bread pans with high sides. When the dough is light bake. 
The bread may be allowed to rise once, and then shape into loaves. If 
salted cornmeal is used lessen the salt.

STEAMED PUDDINGS 

Steam may come in direct contact with food as when cooking 
fowl, rice, etc., and prevents browning and loss of moisture. It may 
be used merely to heat or cook mixtures. (Materials cooked in a double 
boiler, or in a pan set into another of boiling water). 

Steam prevents burning and is a good method for mixtures in 
covered molds which have sufficient moisture in themselves, but re- 
quire long cooking. Molds may be put into a steamer, or into a colan- 
der or sieve over boiling water, or on a rack or several folds of paper 
in the water. Molds must be well greased and, if they have no covers, 
grease a piece of heavy paper on l)oth sides and tie securely over the 
top.

1 qt. cooked rice. Canned fruit. 

Butter 6 cups and in each one put a layer of rice ^ inch thick. Fill 
the centers with peaches, apricots, cherries, apples, etc. Cover with 
rice, and steam 20 to 30 min. Unm.old and serve with a liquid sauce 
made with the fruit juice. 

OTHER DESSERTS 

Bread Pudding 

2 c. packed stale crumbs. 2 to 3 eggs. 
4 c. hot milk. Yz t. salt. 

Yz c. sweetening. i^ t. vanilla, or other flavoring. 

Soak crumbs in hot milk 15 min. Beat the eggs, add the sweeten- 
ing and flavoring, and mix with the crumbs. Pour into buttered pud- 
ding dish and cook in a pan of warm water. Do not let the water boil. 
Small puddings bake in 25 min. ; large ones will take nearly an hour. 
After the pudding has thickened around the edges take a spoon and 
very gently push the thickened part towards the center. This serves 
sixteen. 

Variations 

With the vanilla flavoring use Y^ c. each of raisins and chopped 
peanuts. 

Use Y2 c. chopped cooked orange peel. 

Use Ya c. more sweetening and 2 oz. chocolate melted over water. 

Use I t. cinnamon, Yz t. cloves, Y\ t. nutmeg. 

Use 4 eggs. Incorporate two eggs and two yolks in the pudding. 

Make a meringue of two whites beaten stiff and Ya c- sugar. Brown 
in a moderate oven. 

In a pudding dish place alternate layers of strained apple sauce 
and slices of bread spread with butter substitute. Use bread for the 



46 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

top layer. The sauce should be quite sweet, and seasoned with vanilla, 
lemon, or spice. Toasted bread gives a pleasing flavor, but requires 
more liquid than the other. Bake 30 to 40 min. in a moderate oven, or 
until the bread has become thoroughly saturated with the sauce and 
puffed up. Crushed cooked prunes with the juice may be used in the 
same manner. 

Apple Cobbler 

Wipe, pare, quarter and core 6 apples. Make a syrup of i c. water, 
1/3 c. white or brown sugar, and 2/3 c. corn syrup. Add enough apples 
to cover bottom of the saucepan, placing core side down as this is the 
hardest part. Cook until soft but the pieces still retain original shape. 
Remove apples and cook the remaining pieces. Reduce syrup and pour 
over the apples in a baking dish. Spice may be added if desired. Cover 
with a biscuit crust and bake 20 to 30 min. Dried apples, pears, peaches 
or prunes may be used after soaking and cooking. If dried fruit is 
substituted add a little lemon juice or vinegar to bring out the flavor. 
This serves six to eight persons. 

Fruit Dumplings 

Heat canned or cooked fruit in an agate saucepan and be sure 
there is sufficient liquid to prevent burning, even if water must be add- 
ed. Prepare small dumplings and cook according to directions. Re- 
move dumplings and sweeten the fruit if necessary. 

Indian Pudding 

5 c. hot milk. i t. ?p.1t. 

1/3 c. soft or Southern cornmeal. i t. ginger or cinnamon. 

1/3 c. molasses. 

Scald milk in a double boiler and very slowly sprinkle in the meal. 
Cook 20 min., then add remaining ingredients. Bake 2 hours in a slow 
oven, or in a fijeless cooker. The whey will separate when the pudding 
is served. This is very good without any sauce, although cream makes 
a delicious accompaniment. This makes twelve portions.

ing; stir constantly. Cook over water 20 min., then put in the finely 
cut peel of two oranges and the salt. Pour into 12 cups; cool. Unmold 
and serve with orange sauce. 



war-time cookery 47 

Variations 

Use the juice from cooked prunes, apricots, or other fruits in place 
of the milk. Use ^ c. starch as the acid of the fruit and the heat tends 
to lessen the thickening property. When no milk is used the mixture 
may be cooked directly over the fire for 5 min. stirring to prevent burn- 
ing. Add the cut up fruit, and mold the pudding. Or, the fruit may be 
added to the pudding made wdth milk and the fruit juice sweetened 
and thickened for a sauce. 

The whites of two eggs may be beaten stiff and folded into the 
pudding after removing from the fire. Serve with custard sauce made 
with the yolks of eggs. (See sauces). 

i^ oz. chocolate or % c. cocoa may be cooked with the pudding. 
In this case a little more sweetening will be required. Use i^ t. vanilla 
with this combination. 

3/2 c. chopped nuts, dried cocoanut, or raisins may be added to 
the dessert. 

Serve plain cornstarch pudding with chocolate or raisin sauce. 

Tapioca Desserts 

There are innumerable desserts made of tapioca wliich are most 
palatable and attractive. These may be found in any cook book, or a

the paste to the hot milk and cook over water 15 min. ; stir occasionally. 
Mix yolks, sugar, and salt and over these pour the hot liquid, stirring- 
all the time. Return to the double boiler and stir constantly until the 
mixture coats the spoon. Cool the custard and add vanilla. 

PASTRY 

Pies should be looked upon as a luxury under the present condi- 
tions, and when served should be of the one crust variety, in so far as 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 49 

possible, all materials should conserve such foods as wheat, sugar and 
lard. 

Following are a few helpful suggestions : 

Delicious Pie Crust 

I c. pastry flour. 34 t. salt. 

1 c. rye flour. About Yz c. cold water. 
Yz to 2/3 c. hard vegetable fat or 

Scant Yz c. chilled vegetable oil. 

Mix the flour and salt ; add the fat, chopping or cutting it in. Add 
the cold water gradually, trying not to wet the same portion twice. 
Keep cutting the paste with a knife until the mixture forms a ball of 
dough. The amount of water will depend upon the quantity of fat 
used and the composition of the flour. The paste should not be crumb- 
ly, nor should it be sticky and cling to the sides of the dish. Turn the 
paste out on a well floured board, and work a minute until the mixture 
holds together. Roll out into shape, keeping the paste as circular as 
possible. With care and experience there need be few trimmings. 
Worked over pastry is never so satisfactory. Line a pie plate with 
pastry and sprinkle a little flour in the bottom if the filling is thin; this 
helps to prevent soaking. If the crust is to be baked first place it on 
the inverted pie plate, prick with a fork, and bake. The crust will puflf 
up a little when it begins to cook and will require a second pricking to 
keep the bottom flat. These proportions will make 3 pastry shells. 

Cranberry and Raisin Pie 

2 c. cranberries. ^ c. cornstarch. 

1 c. water. ^ to i c. raisins. 

^ c. corn syrup and ^4 c. sugar. i t. vinegar or lemon juice. 

Cook berries and water in a covered sauce pan until fruit is soft. 
Add sweetening; then the cornstarch mixed with a very little cold 
water. Stir constantly until the mixture boils ; add raisins and cook in 
a double boiler 20 min. Add acid now, for if acid is cooked with starch 
it will thin the mixture. Cool covered, or stir occasionally while cool- 
ing to prevent a crust from forming. Pour into crust before the mix- 
ture stiffens, so that the surface will be smooth. Strips of cookei psste 
or bow knots may be placed on top the pie. 

Lemon Fieeing 

2 c. water. Pinch of salt. 

I c. sugar or Juice and grated rind of 

Yi c. sugar and Y^. c corn syrup i large lemon or orange 
5 T. cornstarch. i ^gg, separated. 

Cook water, sweetening, starch, and salt in same manner as cran- 
berry filling. After 20 min. pour a little of the hot filling into the stir- 



50 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

red egg yolk. Add this to the rest of the mixture, and beat in quickly 
and thoroughly. Cool, pour filling into crust, cover with meringue or 
drop it on by spoonfuls. Brown in a moderate oven, as too great heat 
will toughen the egg. 

Meringue 

To the egg white add i t. cold water and beat vigorously until stiff. 
Add 2 T. sugar a little at a time, and beat until meringue is stiff and 
glossy. 

Squash, Pumpkin or Sweet Potato Filling 

i^ c. dry sifted vegetable. >^ t. ginger. 

}i c. corn syrup. ^ t. salt. 

^ c. sugar. 2 c. hot milk. 

^ t. nutmeg. 4 T. cornstarch. 

Mix ingredients and prepare in same manner as the lemon filling. 
Fill crust before mixture stiffens. All cornstarch mixtures should be 
thoroughly cooked, stiff enough not to run, and yet not pasty. If it is 
a little too stiff, add a spoonful of milk or water. 

The cornstarch may be omitted and two eggs used for thickening. 
Mix with the other materials and pour in a tin lined with uncooked 
paste. Place pie on the bottom of a coal range or lower grate of gas 
range for ten minutes. This cooks the bottom crust a little and helps 
to prevent soaking. Now place pie in center of oven and decrease heat 
to prevent overcooking the custard. Bake. 

If sweet potato is used add only ^2 c. sweetening. The top may be 
covered lightly with dessicated cocoanut. This fills 2 small pastry 
shells. 

Prune Filling / 

Wash I lb. prunes and soak overnight. Cook in the same water 
until fruit is plump and tender, then stone. Strain off the liquid ; add 
I t. lemon juice and cook until thick and the quantity is just sufficient 
to coat the prunes. Pour syrup over fruit, put into baked pastry shell, 
and serve. Whipped cream piled on top the pie makes a pleasing com- 
bination but is not necessary. 

Prune Filling // 

y2 lb. prunes. 1/3 c. cornstarch mixed with 

I c. sweetening. ^2 c. cold water. 

Piece stick cinnamon. I T. lemon juice. 
Boiling water. 

Wash and soak prunes. Simmer until soft; remove stones and cut 
fruit into halves. Measure liquid and add enough boiling water to make 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 5" J 

2J/2 c. Prepare water, sweetening, cinnamon, and cornstarch in same 
manner as lemon filling. At the end of 20 min. remove cinnamon, add 
lemon juice and prunes. When it is thickened but not stiff, put filling 
into cooked crust and place in icebox or a cool place until set. 

Deep Dish Apple PiE 

5 sour apples. % t. nutmeg or cinnamon. 

1/3 c. sugar or molasses. Pinch of salt. 

2/3 c. corn syrup. i T. butter substitute. 

Wash, pare, core, and slice apples. Combine first five ingredients 
and put into a deep earthern or granite dish. Put pieces of butter on 
top. Moisten edge of dish with cold water, put over the pastry and 
press edge of pastry against rim of dish. The crust should be per- 
forated to let out the steam. Bake pie in a quick oven at first then 
lower the heat. Cook 30 to 40 min., or until apples are tender. 

Dried apples or other fruit may be used after soaking overnight. 
Sweetening and spice may be varied according to the fruit and individ- 
ual taste. 



SALADS 

Salads may consist of cold cooked meats, fish, etc. ; vegetables 
cooked or raw, fruits, nuts, or a combination of these materials. The 
distinctive feature of a salad is a dressing of fat, acid, and seasonings. 

Points to be Remembered in Making Salads 

Salad plants should be clean, crisp, cold, and dry; cut material 
should be in uniform pieces. Meat, fish, potatoes, or any material that 
will absorb dressing, should be mixed with a French dressing, chilled, 
and drained from superfluous dressing just before serving. 

The ingredients composing the salad should not be combined until 
the last moment as the lettuce will become wilted. 

Garnish attractively, with regard to proper combinations of colors 
and flavors. Too much decoration is worse than none at all. 

The materials on hand at the moment, and the ingenuity of the 
maker, must be depended upon for variety. 

Scissors find many uses in the kitchen, but are especially valuable 
for cutting chicken without tearing into bits; for shredding peppers, 
tomatoes, etc. 



52 WAR-TIME COOKERY 

SALAD DRESSINGS 

French Dressings 

)< t. salt. 2 T. vinegar, or lemon juice. 

14 t. pepper. 6 T. oil. 

Put the materials into a bottle or fruit jar; cork tightly, and shake 
hard until the ingredients are well blended. The colder the material 
the more quickly the emulsion will form. 

Cooked Dressing 

I c. milk. 2 T. butter substitute. 

•}/; t. mustard. i egg. 

Pepper to taste. M c. vinegar. 
I T. sugar. 

Take a little of the cold milk and make a smooth paste that will 
pour. Heat the remainder of milk, add the thickening, and cook over 
water 15 min. Mix the dry materials with the slightly beaten egg. 

Pour hot liquid over the egg, return to the double boiler, stir and 
cook until a custard is formed. Add butter ; cool custard and add vine- 
gar. If dressing curdles, beat it until smooth. 

Sour Cream Dressing 

1 c. thick sour cream. J :^ t. salt. 

2 T. vinegar or lemon juice. Pepper. 

Mix ingredients thoroughly and dress salad. 

Bacon Dressing 

5 T. bacon fat. V->. c. water. 

2 T. flour. T egg yolk. 

Paprika. Salt if needed. 

5 T. vinegar 

Make a sauce of first five mgredients and pour into yolk, stirring 
constantly. Cool and add to salad. This is especially good with dand- 
elions, endive, beet greens, etc. 

Mock Mayonnaise Dressing 

6 T. flour. T c. boiling water. 
I t. salt, or more. }i c. acid. 

y2 t. mustard. 2 yolks of eggs. 

Pepper. i c. oil (chilled). 

4 T. oil. 

Make a sauce of the nour, seasonings and 4 T. of oil and water. 



WAR-TIME COOKERY 53 

Boil gently 3 min., and pour into the well mixed eggs. Stir occasion- 
ally as dressing cools to prevent a crust from forming. When COLD, 
add acid, mix well; add the cupful of oil 1/3 at a time and after each 
addition beat hard with a Dover egg beater. This makes a very thick 
mixture, and can be used for garnishing as it does not soften so readily 
as a Mayonnaise dressing. 

Cranberry Jelly Substitute 

I qt. cranberries. 1^4 c. corn syrup. 

I c. water. 4 T. cornstarch. 

y2 c. sugar. 

Pick over berries ; wash ; cover with i c. boiling water, and cook 
in a covered saucepan until the fruit is soft. Add sweetening, and 
when dissolved, thicken liquid with cornstarch mixed with a very little 
cold water. Cook 5 min. directly over the fire. When cold this mix- 
ture should not be stiff, nor yet soft enough to run. This serves sixteen 
persons. 

Preserved Orange Peel 

The peels may be kept in a brine for several days (2 T salt to i pt. 
water). When a sufficient number have accumulated, pour off the 
brine and let the fruit skins stand in fresh water for 15 min.; re-heat. 
Simmer 30 min., or until tender; drain. For every 6 orange peels al- 
low I c. corn syrup and i c. boiling water. Cook the tender peels in 
this syrup until thoroughly saturated, and they look clear. By this 
time the liquid should have evaporated until almost a candy. Spread
