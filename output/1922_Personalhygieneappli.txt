PREFACE 



THE aim of this book is to improve the quality of human 
life. It is evident from the title that this aim seeks its 
goal by means of hygiene, but it should be clear also 
that no mere recitation of informational hygiene can be 
justified if the aim is to be achieved. To improve human 
living one must not only set forth the rules of health but 
also one must bring them in contact with that deep and 
ever-flowing source of human action where ideals, ambi- 
tions, attitudes, prejudices, hopes, and aspirations are 
born. To find the scientific rule for health is not more 
important than to touch the mainspring to action that 
will give life and meaning to the rule discovered. 

The interest in health today is very great. In propor- 
tion to its importance and in relation to past appreciations 
health is not overvalued. But we should be careful not 
to appraise it too highly as an isolated value. Oftentimes 
we make it too prominent as an end; then it protrudes too 
much and mars the whole of life. To recognize that it is 
of meaning and significance only in its relation to other 
values is tremendously important today. Three of the 
finest things in life heroism, creative work, and child- 
bearing are often injurious to health. To avoid battle 
for the right, or to forsake productive work, or to miss 
parenthood because of the toll in health that these things 
take twists and warps life and mixes values woefully. 
The sacrifice of health in personal, selfish, and unsocial 
ways can never receive sanction. Contrariwise, the scars 
from the "strenuous and dangerous activities of helping 
to create" a new rule of right and justice, "a new har- 
mony or a new child" are symbols of the divine. Health is 
more than perfect digestion, more than perfect bodily 
functions. To find what more it is constitutes an impor- 
tant part of the problems of hygiene. 



10 PREFACE 

The first five chapters consider the various aspects of 
this problem the meaning of health in terms of life. 
The treatment is not complete. No one recognizes their 
inadequacy more than the author. To write a philosophy 
of life in terms of aims and goals, and to tie such philos- 
ophy up with the immediate, thrusting appeals of the 
moment, as the problems in human living are revealed, is 
more than this can claim. Rather, I must be content to 
sketch certain points of view, to hazard a hope here and 
there, to suggest ideal guides, to inveigh against palpably 
false ones, and everywhere to emphasize the identity of 
hygiene with life and the necessity for knowledge to flow 
into action. Therefore, to insist that hygiene can never 
be, for life purposes, an academic subject to be learned 
merely, and to hold with real conviction that it is useful 
only as it is lived, have been controlling guides here. 

The remaining chapters consider in a systematic way 
hygiene from its scientific side. The finest ideals in the 
world cannot prevail against an infected lung; science 
with her torch will always be needed to illumine the 
processes of life. For discussion purposes, however, the 
treatment has been systematic. This has its advantages, 
obviously. Its disadvantages, while indirect, are no less 
real. Life does not manifest itself in circulatory, nor in 
muscular, nor in nervous pathways alone. The unity of 
mind and body preclude that. It is always vain to force 
the living into set molds. "All the molds crack. They 
are too narrow, above all, too rigid, for what we try to put 
into them." To preserve the unity and harmony of life 
has been attempted throughout. Nevertheless, the dis- 
advantage of such organization remains unless the reader 
sees beyond the boundary lines. 

The book aims to be scientific and accurate according 
to the latest information available. It has tried to avoid 
propaganda, to convert, or to get people to follow a scheme. 
It has aimed to present facts in human experience, to 
establish science and intelligence as guides, and to replace 
superstition, cults, fads, tradition, and certain instinctive

responses with truer counsellors. In this respect it is 
expressing a dominant mood in education today and takes 
its position courageously, asking that truth shall decide, 
let the results seem what they may. 

This book is planned for college students. Not only 
to students of health does it seek to present its case but 
also to students of sociology, philosophy, and education. 
There are reciprocal values to be found in the touch with 
other fields. Hygiene has been in need of a sociologic 
point of view, a philosophic approach, and educational 
standards that would stimulate careful instruction and 
would deserve credit in university and college curricula. 
Education in special fields for other reasons needs to con- 
sider the problem of human health and biologic problems 
in living. "Health in Education and Education in Health" 
is a significant slogan. 

It is hoped that this book may not be constricted to 
the school or college field. Physicians, teachers, nurses, 
social workers require a book which they may recom- 
mend to parents or patients in need of guidance for 
living. The emphasis on the mental and social aspects 
of health, as well as the physical, suggests its usefulness in 
facilitating social adjustments. 

Health results from living in the proper way. It flows 
from life as a by-product of actions, responses, or con- 
ditions that are wholesome. So that whether in college 
or out, the problems of human living remain essentially 
the same: to adjust a rather primitive, biologic organism 
to a complex civilized society, and to shape society to 
provide for man's essential biologic and social needs. 
The view held for this problem of human adjustment is 
that one should first face the problems and then try to 
meet them squarely and honestly, paying whatever price 
is required. Therefore, I have spoken vigorously against 
the bankrupt methods that aim "to beat the game," to 
find a short cut, or to seek a royal road. 

I am glad to acknowledge my indebtedness to students 
and colleagues for help in the preparation of this book. 



12 PREFACE 

The former have been stimulating questioners; the latter, 
the kindest and most helpful of critics. I wish to acknowl- 
edge here my indebtedness to Dr. T. D. Wood, a pioneer 
in the problems of health instruction. I bear to him the 
homage and respect worthy of a grateful student to a 
great teacher. To Professor H. C. Pearson, who has given 
many helpful suggestions, to Professors M. 8. Rose and 
W. H. Eddy, who have proposed many good points in the 
chapter on nutrition, to Professor M. A. Bigelow and Dr. 
E. E. Foster, who have read the entire manuscript, giving 
a keen criticism of form and content, I am under deep 
obligation. 

In particular, at this time and place, I desire to thank 
Professor William H. Kilpatrick who has guided me 
through two writings of the first five chapters. For his 
invaluable criticism I am greatly indebted. 

Citations and quotations from numerous sources are 
indicated in the footnotes of the text. These references 
are suggestive of helpful material for further study along 
the lines indicated. For permission to quote I am greatly 
indebted to the publishers concerned. I wish to take this 
opportunity to acknowledge this permission granted and 
to express my appreciation of the courtesy extended by

What I owe to others in these matters is very large. 
However, the errors, where they occur, are mine.

III. WHAT REALLY DEFINES HEALTH. 

IV. FORCES DEFINING HEALTH TODAY: 

1. The Influence of Leaders. 

2. The Influence of Organizations. 

3. The Influence of the Life of the People. 
V. To LIVE MOST AND TO SERVE BEST. 

A Definition of Health. Health is defined in dictionary 
and encyclopedia as a condition of physical soundness, or 
as a condition in which the organism discharges its 
functions efficiently. The word "health" is derived from 
the Old English word hcelth, the condition of being safe 
and sound. Today, in the minds of most people, health 
has this historic meaning and is considered merely as 
freedom from disease. 

There is in this definition of health, as freedom from 
disease, no appreciation of the varying degrees of health- 
fulness among those usually classed as well, and no under- 
standing of the heights that could be attained in human 
health and living if all the available means for improving 
health were employed. One need be only a casual ob- 
server to recognize that a great number of people are 
living below their best level of attainment. Many persons 
believe themselves healthy because they are not sick in 
bed, and this lack of appreciation of health as a quality of 
life prevents the realization of a greatly superior type of 
life. It is, perhaps, impossible to say how far any in- 
dividual could progress in achieving a finer and higher 

2 17 



18 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

level of living. It is not too much to say, however, that 
health, as an idea, should imply more than freedom from 
disease. Such broadening of the idea would bring not only 
increased health values but also desirable social values. 

It is of value to think of health as that condition of the 
body that makes possible the highest enjoyment of life, 
the greatest constructive work, and that shows itself in 
the best service to the world. It involves keeping the 
body and mind at the highest levels, living at one's best 
and not being satisfied with mere absence from the hospital 
and sick room. This concept of health, moreover, parts 
company with that idea of health which takes it as an 
end of life. It refuses to consider as healthy the individual 
who employs a wonderful physical body for purely selfish 
and socially undesirable ends. 

Such a doctrine as "health for health's sake" is entirely 
unsatisfactory. Health is not an end in itself except for 
the individual sick in bed, and then he desires only to free 
himself from his disease and "to get well." 1 "Health for 
health's sake" is similar to such sayings as "sport for 
sport's sake" and "art for art's sake." All of these say- 
ings err in making an end of the subject. Sport is of value 
and should be pursued not for the sake of sport, but for 
the sake of the training of mind, body, and spirit that 
comes in contesting in a fine way with one's fellows. Art 
for the sake of art is mere superficiality and pose. Art 
is significant because it portrays in imperishable marble, 
canvas, music, or written word the finest emotions and 
thoughts of the human race. Health is of significance in 
proportion as it denotes a condition of the whole organism, 
expressing its functions in joyous play, satisfying work, 
and needed service to others. 

Health may be defined, therefore, as the quality of life 
that renders the individual fit to live most and to serve best. 
The meaning of "to live most and to serve best" cannot be 
expressed readily. Such things can rarely be defined 

1 Cabot, R. C. : What Men Live By, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 



THE MEANING OF HEALTH 19 

acceptably in words. To try to do so would be like an 
attempt to define the term "a good life." Phrases of this 
kind are to be defined best in terms of personality. The 
person is the definition of the term whenever the term 
includes the ideals and aspirations of the human heart. 
Roosevelt, in The Strenuous Life, Gulick, in The Efficient 
Life, and Pastor Wagner, in The Simple Life, set standards 
of living that have health implications, but neither Roose- 
velt, nor Gulick, nor Wagner defined the life that seemed 
to them so good. For some "to live most and to serve 
best" will mean one thing, for others it will mean some- 
thing else. The world may well hope that more and more 
men will give to it a human and social meaning, a mean- 
ing founded in truth and full of good will to all. 

Such a definition of health is broad, but it omits no 
aspect of life, nor does it include too much. It must be as 
wide as life, because life is more than digestion, circulation, 
or nerve response. The physical aspects of health must 
be interpreted along with the mental and the social. The 
accumulating evidence from hospitals, social service 
bureaus, and physicians themselves testifies to this unity 
of life. The causes of ill health and disease are social and 
mental as definitely, though not so frequently, as physical 
causes. Moreover, such definition asks that life be 
thought of as a whole. Physicians know that they may 
not speak of the health of the heart and omit other organs 
from consideration. Viewing life as a whole and not as 
made up of dissected parts does not mean neglect of the 
physical. Rather it demands even more clearly that 
physical vigor be considered fundamental. It only asks 
that body serve mind and spirit; that the "temple of the 
soul" be a servant, ready and trained to serve high causes 
and noble ends. 

This broadening of the concept of health is justified by 
life. In the final analysis vigorous body and keen mind 
are of the highest value in proportion as they serve the 
highest causes. The test of body and mind is the test 
not of weight lifting nor of mental gymnastics, but of 



20 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

meeting the crises of life in such a way that a distinct 
advance has been made either for the individual or for 
society, or both. The ultimate test is the way in which 
health is used; it is the test of conduct, because in this test 
the physical and the psychical are subjected to the greatest 
pressure. The highest and best expressions of conduct 
will be seen when the sound body and the sound mind 
form the spring from which the action flows. This test 
is well illustrated by Paton 1 when he says, "Any person 
who is familiar with the most elementary laws governing 
human behavior recognizes that the chief test of a sound 
mind in a sound body is the ability to act in a crisis." 

It is helpful to think of health as a quality of life 
capable of enrichment or deterioration. How fine a 
quality may be obtained by any individual is unknown, 
but the degree of health possible with rational knowledge, 
attention, and effort is considerably higher for every 
person. Health as freedom from disease is a standard of 
mediocrity; health as a quality of life is a standard of in- 
spiration and increasing achievement. 

The Definition Examined. The definition of health as 
the quality of life that renders the individual fit to live most 
and to serve best has not hitherto enjoyed any wide accept- 
ance. This is true for several reasons. In the first place, 
people are not well informed of the way health is secured 
and maintained. The home has not been prepared nor in- 
clined to instruct in matters of health and the public 
schools have only recently been willing to accord hygiene 
a place in the curriculum. The ignorance of the people in 
matters of body structure and function has made easy 
the way for charlatans, quacks, and fakirs by clever ad- 
vertising to sell their spurious health preparations and 
prescriptions. Indirectly flowing out of such a situation 
is a great amount of harm, misinformation, and false 
guides. One advertisement reads: "Eat what you want, 
drink manacea water and digest it." It should be noted 
that even if manacea were efficacious as a digesting water, 
1 From a letter to the New York Times, July 10, 1917. 



THE MEANING OF HEALTH 21 

the teaching of the advertisement is directly contrary to 
all that is important in personal hygiene. It may never 
be advisable for any person to eat what he wants; it fre- 
quently is very undesirable for him to do so. 

In the second place, this definition of health is not widely 
accepted because people are so greatly interested in 
economic and social success that they are unduly willing 
to sacrifice health for the rewards of work. Many busy 
men are unwilling to practice hygiene because they say 
they have no time for it. Professional and business people 
generally trade too much of vitality for work in careless, 
inefficient, and wasteful ways. For some, service is such 
an inspiration that they literally wear themselves out in 
its pursuit. Service should never mean suicide, although 
there may be emergencies when service demands the 
sacrifice of life. One is only fit to serve, even as one is 
only fit to work, as one keeps oneself prepared to live most 
and to serve best. 

And finally, this definition has no universal appeal be- 
cause people lack a philosophy of life that would keep 
values in proper proportion, that would see straight, and 
that would link the part to the whole, the personal to the 
social. The vain effort to buy happiness and to buy 
recreation is expressive of the same fruitless belief that 
personal health can be bought for a price. Public health 
is purchasable in the sense that sufficient money for 
adequate sanitation will control the transmission of com- 
municable disease, but personal health cannot be bought 
by appropriations of money. It can only be possessed by 
spending time for the care of the body, by selling some- 
thing of work for recreation, by giving of self in objective, 
disinterested work for others. It is important to re- 
member that one always pays. To achieve vitality, 
strength, personal efficiency costs something that must be 
taken from work, from instinctive pleasures, or from in- 
dulgence of unwholesome habits. There is no way "to 
beat the game" of life. The stream of life will be rich, 
abundant, lasting in proportion as the sources which con- 



22 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

stantly nourish it are flowing. And these sources are 
neither magical nor mysterious. They belong to every 
man and, briefly, are, fresh air, food of proper kind and 
amount, wholesome exercise and recreation, proper habits 
of posture and care of the body, avoidance of alcohol and 
other poisons, and proper attitude of mind. 

What Really Defines Health. The examination of the 
definition proposed shows that health cannot be defined 
academically. No writer on hygiene can do more than 
indicate desirable guides and the path of his discussion. 
For most people health is defined by the ideas and ideals 
of the periods in which they live. The Athenian Greek 
subjected to the standards of harmony and beauty in 
Greek life, the Roman citizen in the grasp of militaristic 
virtues, the ascetic, a pale and pallid product of the 
monastic system, were aU definitions of health in terms of 
the ideas and ideals of their times and places. Simon 
Stylites "rotted with the dew" because for him there was 
no inspiration in health and vitality. Wherever the 
monastic system and the scholastic philosophy touched 
life they withered it. The ideas and ideals of the time and 
place make the definitions of life. 

Forces Defining Health Today. The old ideas have 
little sanction today. The scientific and the historic 
studies have rewritten the story of human life. With 
new emphases, health has new meanings. The civilized 
nations are getting away from the ideas of asceticism with 
its contempt for the physical. We, in America, have 
never had the militaristic virtues, and the workings of 
beauty have been too little known. More characteristic 
of our age and land are the developing social conscience 
and the increasing sense of social responsibility. 1 This is 
no passing mood, but a tendency of deeper growth. It is 
hardly necessary to say that it is filled with rich possi- 
bilities for the improvement of life physically, mentally, 
and socially.

1907, pp. 99-102. 



THE MEANING OF HEALTH 23 

The Influence of Leaders. This sense of social re- 
sponsibility is expressing itself through leaders, through 
organizations, and through the life of the people. It has 
given us great leaders to define health in terms of living, 
as it should be defined. The immortal Roosevelt with the 
out-of-doors upon him, the beloved Burroughs singing his 
songs to the accompaniment of nature's harmonies, have 
pointed out the way. Leaders and teachers everywhere 
are stressing in their lives and in their works social re- 
sponsibility. 

The movement for the conservation of our natural re- 
sources is a part of this mood; and the people are saying, 
"More precious than mines, or rivers, or forests is the 
health and vitality of the nation." 1 Fisher's "Report on 
National Vitality," 2 the revelations of the Selective 
Service Act, 3 and lessons from the World War in many 
fields of life have stimulated a growing appreciation of the 
social significances of ill health with a better definition re- 
sulting. As illustrative of the power of these forces in our 
life today witness the report 4 of the commission for the 
study of secondary education of the National Education 
Association. This report, "The Cardinal Principles of 
Secondary Education," sets forth health as the first of 
seven objectives for secondary education. Educators 
have ceased talking of education only in intellectualistic 
terms and have begun to consider health as a cardinal 
principle of education. 

The Influence of Organizations. Numerous organiza- 
tions have sprung into existence in response to this mood 
of social responsibility for health. Well-established 
agencies have become increasingly active. Child health

ments. The Child Health Organization, the National 
Tuberculosis Association, the Joint Committee of the 
American Medical Association and the National Educa- 
tion Association, and the National Child Health Council 
are doing splendid service in propaganda, teaching, and 
setting of standards, based upon careful study of con- 
ditions and needs. The older organizations, such as the 
Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor, the 
American Red Cross, the National Child Welfare Associ- 
ation, the Life Extension Institute, the American School 
Hygiene Association, the Elizabeth McCormick Memorial 
Fund, and other foundations, are co-operating in many 
programs for the conservation and improvement of 
human health. Boards of Health, State Departments of 
Health, and the United States Public Health Service are 
raising standards and thus helping to define and give 
meaning to health. 

The Influence of the Life of the People. But even more 
powerful than leaders and more extensive than the work 
of organizations is the influence of society itself as ex- 
pressed in the actual life of its members. The customs 
and mores of the people are reaching higher levels. Much 
remains to be done, both in social and in personal effort, 
but there are, nevertheless, signs of an open trail to better 
health. The interest in play and recreation, the out-of- 
door and camping customs so recently developed, the 
improvement in dress, and the increasing education of 
children in hygiene are favorable signs, indeed. The hope 
that William James 1 expressed some years ago is being 
fulfilled: "I hope that here in America more and more the 
ideal of the well-trained and vigorous body will be main- 
tained neck and neck with that of the well-trained and 
vigorous mind as the two co-equal halves of the higher 
education for men and women alike. The strength of the 
British Empire lies in the strength of character of the 
individual English man, taken all alone by himself, and

Co., New York, 1916, p. 205. 



THE MEANING OF HEALTH 25 

that strength, I am persuaded, is perennially nourished 
and kept up by nothing so much as by the national worship, 
in which all classes meet, of athletic outdoor life and 
sport." 

At one time intentional physical education in America 
was limited to the stilted and artificial exercise of the 
German and Swedish systems of gymnastics. These 
systems never really stirred the spirit of the people. Im- 
pregnated with the spirit of the older European institu- 
tions, they had little in common with our democracy and 
the social ideals shaping this nation. A militaristic ideal 
incorporated in the schools and taught from pulpit and 
platform might do for us what it did for Germany in the 
development of physically strong, docile minded in- 
dividuals, but such an aim would run counter to the 
dominant trait of the American people and could only be 
achieved by the destruction of democracy and its in- 
stitutions of freedom. This type of physical education 
has largely yielded to a better. In its place there has been 
a phenomenal growth in play and all forms of athletic 
sports and games. Not all the growth, sad to say, has been 
wholesome. The athlete has shown too frequently in 
competition, and especially in the professional field, the 
absence of those social and moral qualities of paramount 
importance today. 1 

The absence of the educational point of view in the 
management of school and college athletics and the em- 
phasis on the professional, spectacular, and exhibitive 
elements are to be deplored. The activity of alumni 
primarily interested in "putting the college on the athletic 
map" has made questionable contributions. 

This movement for play and physical activity, wide- 
spread though it is, is not yet everywhere appreciated and 
respected. In many respects the liberal arts colleges are 
still breathing the breath of scholasticism in the theory 
that guides their cultural education. The pressure of 

1 Williams, J. F.: The Education of the Emotions, Teachers Col- 
lege Record, May, 1920, pp. 201-216.

studies, the long hours demanded in laboratory and class 
room leave no choice for the youth to be anything else but 
anemic and physically weak. There is no comprehensive 
scheme in the minds of many who lead in educational 
matters to provide for that broad training of the body 
that results in characters of force, initiative, and noble- 
ness. It should be remembered that the "bookworm" 
who neglects his physical needs is to be condemned equally 
with the athlete who neglects his mental growth. This 
neglect of the physical in education not only deprives the 
youth of opportunity for wholesome growth, but by failure 
to teach habits of exercise in purposive play and games it 
lays the foundation for further physical deterioration in 
adult life through inability to use and to enjoy the physical 
means of recreation. 

To Live Most and to Serve Best. Health as a quality of 
life is a challenge to all leaders, to all organizations, to all 
persons, everywhere, to interpret health in terms of 
service. The definition given at the beginning of this 
chapter claims recognition from all those who now seek 
merely the liberation of man from disease, from inefficiency, 
from physical weakness, and degeneracy. It asks that 
personal and social effort to improve health, to eradicate 
disease, to enrich the processes of life shall be directed 
constantly toward the purpose of life itself as that may be 
understood. Not health, but life itself; to live most and 
to serve best, this is the goal. 

Cabot 1 is sounding the same note when he says: " As- 
suming that in everyone there is an infinite and restless 
desire to get into the life of the world to share any and 
all life that is hot and urgent or cool and clear we can 
tackle this infinite task in two ways: 

"By trying to understand the universe in the samples of 
it which come to our ken, and to draw from these bits of 
knowledge which typifies and represents the whole. That 
is science. 

1 Cabot, R. C. : What Men Live By, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 
1914, pp. .84, 85, 



THE MEANING OF HEALTH 27 

"By trying to serve. When we try to serve the world 
(or to understand it) we touch what is divine. We get our 
dignity, our courage, our joy in work because of the great- 
ness of the far-off end always in sight, always attainable, 
never attained. Service is one of the ways by which a 
tiny insect like one of us can get a purchase on the whole 
universe. If we find the job where we can be of use, 
we are hitched to the star of the world, and move with it."

The Nation's Vitality. In the last few years there has 
been a great deal of interest in the conservation of our 
national resources. There have been sufficient reasons 
why we should conserve our national wealth, and a great 
many people have been interested in conserving forests, 
water power, and national mines. But there are many 
sources of national wealth. From a broad standpoint the 
greatest resource of the nation is the health of the people. 
The loss that accrues yearly in this part of our wealth is 
more dangerous and more terrible for the welfare of the 
nation than the loss that comes in the exploitation of our 
forests and mines. 1 

In the report on "National Vitality/' 2 elsewhere re- 
ferred to, preventable sickness and preventable deaths 
have been estimated. Fisher states that about 42 per 
cent, of the deaths of persons in the United States could

be prevented or potsponed "if the knowledge now existing 
among well-informed men in the medical profession were 
actually applied in a reasonable way and to a reasonable 
extent." 

That sickness and death are at time unnecessary and 
are preventable is well known. This fact, however, is 
based upon scientific preventive measures and in no way 
is allied with the mistaken view that ignores matter and 
denies disease. Contrariwise, it is the plainest matter of 
statistics and common sense observation that the nation's 
vitality is wasted by lack of application of the available 
preventable measures of science. 

In terms of morbidity and mortality rates (see Table I, 
pp. 30, 31) the resources of the nation are squandered more 
recklessly, more continuously, and more surely in peace 
than in war. The peace losses are not so dramatic, but just 
as significant. We are inclined to speak of the tremendous 
loss of life in war, and we are horrified by such disasters 
as the Titanic, and the ones at Halifax and Mt. Pelee. 
Because of custom and traditional belief that babies die 
easily we have grown careless about the loss of life below 
the age of five (Fig. 1, p. 32). The significance of this loss 
in England has been pointed out by George Bernard Shaw in 
an address on the Nation's Vitality. He is quoted in part: 

"If we take the number of babies conceived in the womb 
of the women of this nation and who ought to be born, we 
have 938,000. The number that succeeds in getting born 
is about 800,000. This is not a good beginning. It means 
that 138,000 have not sufficient vitality to get themselves 
born; it also means that the mothers were not properly 
fed and properly instructed. Of the 800,000 who do 
manage to enter the world, 100,000 die before they are 
one year old. This means dirty milk or no milk at all 
slums, bad food, ignorance. We lose 100,000 before one 
year of age; we drop another 100,000 before the age of 
fifteen, just when they are becoming industrial producers 
and available for military service, and of the remainder 
who do grow up we find that another 100,000 have to be

that comes from deaths and illness that are preventable. 
There are other losses, however, that are not so readily 
estimated. The losses in the purely personal, in the human 
sphere that show in the psychologic effect upon the mind 
and spirit are incomputable. These losses are in the

breaking up a home long established. Indirectly flowing 
out of the losses of preventable sickness and death are a 
number of social problems. The close relation between 
sickness and inefficiency, between poverty and sickness is 
a correlation that has long been apparent to those who 
work in the field of the social agencies. 

The very close correspondence existing between poverty 
and sickness is expressed by a recent report of the New 
York Association for Improving the Condition of the 
Poor. It shows that out of thousands of dollars spent in 
relieving destitute families, 96 per cent, was given to 
families who had to seek aid because of sickness or death 
in the family. The Charity Organization Society in a 
report 1 by the committee on the Prevention of Tubercu- 
losis records the social study of 35 families suffering from 
tuberculosis. In one place the report says: 

"Reclassifying these 35 families in an attempt to relate 
their economic dependency to their tuberculous condition, 
we find that: 

"(a) Prior to tuberculous infection 

Twenty-one families were apparently self-sup- 
porting; 

Eight families were occasionally dependent; 
Six families were chronic dependents. 
"(6) After tuberculous infection 

One family still apparently self-supporting (re- 
ceived sanitation outfit only). 
Twenty-seven families received occasional relief. 
Seven families were chronic dependents (i. e., 
received some regular allowance, which was 
main support of family)." 

From the Charity Organization report as well as from 
general facts of life it may be understood that there is a 
loss in dislocation of homes, in dependency, in human 
suffering not to be measured in economic values. Such

loss is no less real because it cannot be expressed in actual 
figures. 

Estimated Losses. Realizing that there are losses which 
cannot be computed, we yet may estimate the economic 
loss due to the death of persons from preventable causes. 

After many balances, Fisher has arrived at a statement 
of the value of a human life as measured in dollars. The 
following gives these values : 

At birth.. $ 90.00 

At 5 years 950.00 



At 10 
At 20 
At 30 
At 40 
At 80 



2000.00 
4000.00 
4100.00 
2900.00 
700.00 



Average $1700.00 

Every year about 1,400,000 persons die in the continental 
United States, 1 and on Fisher's basis of preventability of 
42 per cent, the loss in dollars would exceed $1,000,000,000. 
Just as we can estimate the loss that ensues when wages 
are not earned, so it should be possible to estimate with 
some degree of accuracy the economic loss due to sorrow, 
depression, inefficiency due to lack of physical vigor, and 
the other indirect losses associated with a condition of 
unfitness that is not usually classed as disease. 

If we estimate the annual loss from deaths that are 
reasonably preventable to exceed $1,000,000,000, it does 
not seem extravagant to estimate that $5,000,000,000 
would be representative of the loss that comes from persons 
not living at their best. 

Revelations of the Selective Service Draft. Recently the 
results of the draft examinations were available. The 
record indicates OUT national weakness. The Provost 
Marshal General's report shows the following: 

1 The Census Bureau's summary of the annual report on mortality 
statistics (pages 30, 31) shows 1,142,558 deaths as having occurred in 
1920 within the death registration area of continental United States. 
The death registration area has an estimated population of 87,- 
486,713, or 82.2 per cent., of the estimated population of the United 
States. 



THE HEALTH PROBLEM 35 

Total men called 3,082,945 

Total examined by local boards 2,510,706 

Total rejected by local boards for physical reasons . . 730,756 
Percentage rejected of those examined 29. 11 

To this percentage of rejections by the local board 
should be added the rejections at the cantonments. The 
medical corps at the cantonments rejected from 2 to 11 
per cent, of the men certified by the local boards. The 
total rejections must, therefore, be somewhere between 
30.53 and 36.80 per cent. 

If we applied Fisher's estimate of 42 per cent, preventa- 
bility to those cases rejected by Draft Boards we should 
have over 300,000 additional men between the ages of 
twenty-one and thirty-one for service to the nation. The 
incompetence, the social maladjustments, the sickness, 
the early deaths in this 300,000 cannot all be measured. 
The blighting of hopes, the broken dreams of parents, of 
wives, the lowered vitality due to sorrows, disappoint- 
ments, and failures cannot be measured. Putting the 
whole health problem on the economic 1 and social levels 
we find an imperative need not only to prevent sickness 
but also to improve the quality of life. 

Factors in the Health Problem. As we have seen, 
statistics show a great amount of preventable sickness, 
preventable deaths, lowered vitality, and general physical 
unfitness for life. Often the factors at work producing ill 
health appear hopelessly complex. Frequently a circle of 
unfortunate circumstances seem to inclose the individual, 
but in any analysis it will be found that individual health 
is the expression, on the one hand, of influences that 
started to act at the beginning of individual life, and, on 
the other, of influences that have acted upon the individual 
since that time. For discussion purposes these factors 
may be classified in three groups : 

1. Hereditary influences (biologic); 

1 The political economist would make a more critical analysis of 
the worth of a human life than the one given here. Read Essays in 
Social Justice by T. N. Carver, Harvard University Press, 1916, pp. 
173-202.

2. Conditions of the environment before birth and after 
(physical and social) ; 

3. Reaction of the individual to environment (personal). 
These factors are modifiable within certain limitations. 

They are also related. The way an individual responds to 
a situation is in part a matter of original nature and in 
part environment, but in a very real sense, also, it is a 
matter of education that has helped to form habits, that 
has favored certain attitudes, that has inspired ideals. 
This force of education gives direction to the response that 
is possible by nature and permitted by environment. The 
influence of these three factors will be considered sepa- 
rately. 

Heredity as a Factor. It is known that heredity con- 
tributes definitely to the vigor, vitality, or constitution of 
man. For example, it is known that certain races are more 
susceptible than others to certain diseases. In short, the 
germ-plasm of certain individuals contains factors that 
render those individuals more liable to early sickness and 
early death, or, as in other cases, to hardiness and lon- 
gevity. 

The force of heredity is indicated by Conklin 1 : "Fur- 
thermore, from its earliest to its latest stage of develop- 
ment it is one and the same organism; the egg is not one 
being and the embryo another, and the adult a third, but 
the egg of a human being is a human being in the one- 
celled stage of development, and the characteristics of the 
adult develop out of the egg and are not in some mys- 
terious way grafted upon it or transmitted to it." 

What the individual has at birth of vigor, of resistance 
to disease, of ' 'constitution, " is made up in largest part of 
what his parents gave him in the germ-plasm of which he 
is a development. 

It is a very significant fact and to some persons rather 
discouraging that the individual is born into the world 
with certain capacities that mark the limits of his develop- 

1 Conklin, E. G. : Heredity and Environment, Princeton Univer- 
sity Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1917, p. 108. 



THE HEALTH PROBLEM 37 

ment. The biologic world is in essential agreement 1 that 
there .is no transmission of characteristics that are ac- 
quired in the life of the individual, so that the child, with 
certain "chance" variations excepted, will receive from 
the parents only what the parents have to give in the 
germ-plasm which they receive from their parents. 2 It 
must be understood, however, that the development of 
any one person is conditioned by the environment into 
which that one comes, and one of good heredity may 
achieve less in real work and real success than one with 
heredity not so good, but placed in a better environment. 
Parents need to be concerned not only with the heredity 
they convey to their children but also with the sort of 
social and physical environment they prepare for them. 
Social and physical environment is often as valuable, and 
at times more significant, than the biologic inheritance. 
Health, strength, and vigor of the germ-plasm determine 
in a favorable environment the limit of individual achieve- 
ment, but in an unfavorable environment the point 
reached is less than that which was possible according to 
the germinal promise. Society needs to be concerned not 
only with the biologic factors but also with the social and 
personal. For the individual all three are essential. 

Environment as a Factor. Health is an expression of 
the influence of heredity; it is also modified by environ- 
ment. At times what appears as hereditary defect is 
really environmental. Many of the most serious ob- 
stacles to health are environmental. Such obstacles are 
more powerful as factors among the poor, although the 
economic influence in this respect is conditioned largely 
by ignorance. 3 Poverty and ignorance are inseparable 

1 Recent experiments indicate that some forces may be capable 
of producing inheritable defects. See Stockhard, C. R., and Papani-

companions of disease, and when accompanied by de- 
fective heredity place formidable barriers in the way of 
fine living. 

But unfavorable environment is seen not only among 
the poor. The environment may be unfavorable for the 
finest development of the individual even when the 
circumstances of life are otherwise fortunate. The "Poor 
Little Rich Girl" as a type represents the handicap 
under which the members of that class live. It is 
as difficult at times for a child of the Avenue to secure 
vigorous health as it is for the child of the steel mills; 
it is not so general because the latter situation is 
always productive of a lessened opportunity for develop- 
ment. 

As common environmental obstacles to health we may 
note inadequate housing conditions, lack of opportunities 
for wholesome recreation, archaic factory and shop sani- 
tation, prolonged hours of work, unprotected food and 
water supply of communities. All of these conditions may 
be corrected by legislation or otherwise regulated so as to 
leave no element injurious to health. 

Certain aspects of the environment are largely or wholly 
beyond the reach of man. Such are climate, productivity 
of the soil, deposits of minerals, the plains or forests. 
They are not subject to legislation except in a regulatory 
way to prevent exploitation of valuable resources of the 
nation. 

The Role of Legislation. Society should provide the 
most acceptable environment possible. As regards 
housing, labor, recreation, food and water supply legis- 
lation is for this purpose a logical procedure. Laws may 
be passed and then enforced to secure abolition of tene- 
ments that are unsafe and unsanitary, to obtain oppor- 
tunity for leisure and recreation, to prescribe the hours of 
labor, and to protect the food supply. Such legislation 
must be accompanied by education. Social welfare laws 
now on the statutes are less successful for their purposes 
today because relatively too little attention is given to 



THE HEALTH PROBLEM 39 

educational propaganda. Education in the purpose and 
value of laws passed should accompany their application. 
Legal attack on all social problems without educational 
measures often results in disrespect for all law. Radical 
changes of custom may readily produce the sort of tyranny 
or lawlessness exhibited in Russia in the early months of 
the Soviet regime. Too much value should not be assigned 
legalistic measures for improvement of the environment. 
Certain socialistic groups in America, as elsewhere, are 
inclined to give too much weight to the potency of law 
or force in a human organization of man's environment. 
To write and pass laws in harmony with nature, to work 
with and not against nature's forces, involves an appre- 
ciation of life that esteems other things than the economic 
merely. 

The Individual as a Factor. How frequently or to 
what extent heredity is a handicap to health is not known. 
Nor has the full force of environment in controlling health 
been determined. The children of alcoholic, syphilitic, or 
tuberculous parents are presented at birth with health 
hazards. Homes in dark, damp places and work in in- 
sanitary trades and professions militate against vigorous 
health. Probably all of these environmental and heredity 
factors are infrequent risks compared to the more or less 
constant influence of the individual himself. As a factor 
in the health problem the individual and his response to 
all sorts of situations bulk large. Training, education 
these are the great determining forces. That the personal 
factor is significant may be proved by the fact that the 
health problem is serious for many whose heredity and 
environment are both satisfactory. The finest heredity 
and the most favorable environment will not remove the 
health hazards for the following types: 

1. One who believes that the body will care for itself in some 
way without giving it any special care or intelligent attention. 
One who understands that an automobile or a watch needs 
care and attention of a scientific and experienced kind, and 
yet gives no recognition to the claims of the human machine 
in this respect. 



40 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

2. One who follows the promptings of instinct and lives on the 

plane of the lower animals. In matters of hunger, exercise, 
and sex this type is particularly prone to err in this regard. 
One who is often quite willing to attribute to man attributes 
of a higher being in all instances except hunger and sex. 
The failure to appreciate the r61e of intelligence in man in 
problems arising out of these instincts is in the main the 
cause for much of the gastric disturbances of the individual 
and the prevalence of venereal diseases in society. 

3. One who fails to realize the high points that could be reached 

by living at his best. This type lacks ideals, fine standards, 
and habitual attitudes favoring wholesome forms of living. 

Any one or all of these conditions may be existing in the 
life of any one individual, and yet all of them are modifiable 
by education and effort on the part of the individual. 

The Necessity for Education. The health problem will 
be solved only when education in all its power is brought 
to bear upon problems of human living. Legislation is 
helpless without its interpreting aid, and problems of 
heredity can be solved for man only by its sanctions. 
The social legislation of the day is ultimately dependent 
upon education for its success. 

Opinion of society is expressing itself with reference to 
the marriage and propagation of the unfit in a very defi- 
nite way. Appreciating the real danger to the health and 
vigor of the nation in the numerous children born of 
diseased and defective parents, society is attempting to 
make it difficult for those who are unfit to marry, or if 
married, to propagate their kind. The effort to control 
marriage is illustrated in the Eugenic Marriage Law of 
Wisconsin. This law is of insignificant value because it is 
easily and readily evaded, does not secure a blood test 
that would rule out syphilis, and is not accompanied by 
educational efforts to develop sanction for its provisions. 
Essentially, then, it is not worth a great deal because it 
has not quickened the citizens of the state to habits of 
response that would favor racial service and racial in- 
tegrity above personal likes. 

The sterilization law of various states is palliative, but 
justifiable, as striking at one side of the problem. It is 



THE HEALTH PROBLEM 41 

worthwhile, but incomplete and partial. The positive 
educational factors upon which the law is drawn are 
neglected. 

The efforts of society to provide for the repression of 
the unfit types and to promote finer and more desirable 
types must be built around the development of habits of 
control that will serve society. 1 There should be, un- 
questionably, among all people a stronger appreciation of 
the value of a strong biologic inheritance. This can be 
secured only by training and education in which certain 
social attitudes will be approved and the opposites dis- 
approved. Such training and education of young people 
would make it impossible for strong types to "fall in love" 
with weak and wholly undesirable biologic types. Such 
training would not rule out love and romance, but would 
simply control through habitual attitudes the choices that 
would awaken love, just as habituation, the result of 
training with reference to races, makes it impossible in 
almost all cases for the white and negro to marry. There 
are from a biologic standpoint many marriages that are 
as catastrophic in their biologic effect as the marriage of 
white and negro may be socially. Such training of the 
young would make not only for health in the individual 
himself, but, in addition, would provide the basis for in- 
telligent love in line with the principles of eugenics. 

In A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, the 
Queen, Morgan le Fay, responded to the Yankee's argu- 
ments against the murder of her page with the words, 

"Crime!" she exclaimed. "How thou talkest! Crime, 
forsooth! Man, I am going to pay for him!" 

"Oh, it was no use to waste sense on her. Training training is 
everything; training is all there is to a person. We speak of nature; 
what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and train- 
ing. We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; 
they are transmitted to us, trained into us. All that is original in 
us, and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be 
covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the

rest being atoms contributed by, and inherited from, a procession 
of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clan, 
or grasshopper, or monkey, from whom our race has been so tediously 
and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed." 

The heredity and environment of Morgan le Fay 
probably were very defective, but her education had made 
it impossible for her to be other than what she was. 

Lack of Education. Much of the present need for public 
health work and many errors in personal hygiene are due 
to lack of education of a proper kind at the right time. 
It is a matter of common knowledge that often people 
resent the effort to improve living conditions. Organiza- 
tions aiming at health values and providing health pro- 
grams meet opposition in carrying out programs of health 
preservation. This opposition is less marked today than 
formerly, and it is reasonable to suppose that with more 
education in such matters it will cease to be a direct and 
active deterrent of health administration. 

To this end the fact must be realized that the home 
and the members of the family are not laws unto them- 
selves. The mother who sends a child to school when she 
knows he is not well will more and more receive the 
censure of the community, because in doing so she imperils 
the health of the other children in the school. Medical 
inspection in the schools to be reasonably successful must 
have the loyal co-operation of the parents of the school 
children. The education of the parent in proper attitudes 
toward society would help the parent to be as interested 
in preserving the health of the other children in the school 
as she is in expressing the maternal instinct for her own 
child. The infrequency of such response is a token of the 
lack of education in this regard. 

The mother who is angry because the Medical In- 
spector advises that Johnny's teeth be filled, and the 
merchant who objects to the restriction of the Board of 
Health in withholding a license because his shop is in- 
sanitary, are individuals who lack a social education. 
Such individuals may be educated to avoid for them- 






THE HEALTH PROBLEM 43 

selves the causes of disease, but they are defective in 
social training. Their health is of some value in propor- 
tion as they are able to support themselves and cause no 
burden to the state, but as regards their ability to co- 
operate with society in advancing the best interests of all 
they are socially sick. The individual factor in health 
may completely overshadow the influence of heredity and 
environment. It is clear, therefore, that instruction in 
hygiene must be something more than stating the number 
of hours of sleep that man needs or the kind of clothes 
he should wear. Informational education is always 
necessary, but it must be made effective by habituation, 
proper attitudes, and ideals. 

Health Rules Violated Because of Ignorance or Indiffer- 
ence. At times young people violate health rules because 
of ignorance, and both young and old ignore health 
teaching at times because it conflicts with personal desires 
or with established habits. If ignorance alone were at 
the root of the trouble, we might expect great improve- 
ment in health status by an increase of health books in all 
schools and in every community. Those who work with 
young people in the hygiene field know that such a 
remedy, although helpful, would not be a complete success. 
Conferences with college students invariably show that 
they are acquainted with the knowledge of hygiene, but 
have no appreciation of its application to themselves. 
In an annual report (1917) by the Professor of Hygiene to 
the President of the University of Cincinnati there is the 
following statement: "Conferences with students have 
shown that while the individual frequently knows what is 
hygienic, he rarely makes the application to himself." 
Rules of health are helpful in proportion to their use. 
There must be habituation, and this can come only 
through training and education in which ideals have had a 
prominent part. 

The Dynamic Force of an Ideal. "To beat the Hun," 
"to win the war" caught the ear of a people awakened to

that adorned cheap posters they were, and yet expressive 
of a grim determination, fighting for lofty ideals. Out of 
the World War arose high idealistic motives that inspired 
many to become interested in personal health as an aspect 
of national service. During the war groups could be seen 
in more than one city cheerfully joining in a morning 
tramp to promote vigor, or following some special pre- 
scription dictated by a medical examination. Boy Scouts, 
Girl Scouts, and other young persons were similarly in- 
spired. But the war did not last long enough to secure 
habituation in such modes of living. 

Now the war is over! The great dramatic "hinterland" 
of "beating the Hun" is gone! Something else is needed 
to perpetuate and to carry on this spirit of service an 
ideal that will give habitual attitudes on all problems of 
living, an ideal that will be above economic values or in- 
stinctive urges, an ideal that will secure maximum effi- 
ciency and achieve a level of performance above the com- 
monplace! The answer to the health problem is con- 
cerned vitally, therefore, with a consideration of ideals 
and habits.

Stages in Human Conduct. The conduct of a man is 
determined by environment acting through various ways 
upon the original impulses, tendencies, or instincts of his 
nature. We may with profit distinguish, as McDougall 1 
suggests, three levels of conduct, each of which represents 
successive stages to be traversed in turn. These stages are : 

1. The stage of instinctive action in which original 
tendencies are expressed without modification, except that 
produced by the influence of pains or pleasures. Pain or 
pleasure in any situation is the determiner of conduct in 
this stage. The impulses to strike, to eat, to run away 
are expressed fully and completely if they give pleasure; 
they are inhibited if they give pain. This stage represents 
a maximum of nature acting and a minimum of nurture. 
It is found in most complete form among wild barbaric 
peoples. 

2. The stage in which the tendency to instinctive 

1 McDougall, William : An Introduction to Social Psychology, 
John W. Luce & Co., Boston, 1918, Chapter VII, 

45 



46 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

action is modified by rewards or punishments. These 
rewards or punishments are usually administered by the 
social environment or, as in the case of certain religions, 
they may accrue after death. In this stage also the con- 
demnation by society of individual action prevents the 
continuation of the act and tends to inhibit its initiation 
in the future. The control here is fear. Such control by 
society is necessary in the present state of the world. 
Values of significance to the group are thus protected and 
conserved from destruction by the instinctive action of 
the individual, oblivious of social welfare. Such control 
for the individual is entirely unsatisfactory, because when 
group judgment is not acting the individual is with- 
out sufficient guides. This stage is found not only in 
uncivilized society but also in recognized civilized 
states. 

3. The stage in which conduct is controlled, modified, 
and directed by an ideal. Under the influence of ideals 
original tendencies to action are modified, strengthened, 
or weakened, so that the individual's conduct represents 
an expression of ideals. It is clear that such conduct will 
be called good, worthy, or right by society in proportion 
as the ideals serve high aims of social worth and signifi- 
cance. This stage is found among advanced members of 
civilized society. 

Forces Determining Human Conduct. The stages in 
human conduct show a progressive series leading from 
instinctive responses typical of the lower animals to the 
responses guided by ideals which are typical of the best 
in intelligent man. The problem of living finely and well, 
the particular problems of the health of man are expres- 
sions of the development of man in terms of these stages 
of human conduct. No adequate study of hygienic living 
can deal merely with hygienic rules because well-known 
hygienic rules are continually violated. Knowledge of 
the truth may still permit the dominance of instinct. To 
understand the forces determining human conduct lies at 
the very beginning of understanding the problems of 






INTELLIGENCE AND IDEALS 47 

living. Instinct and intellect together are shaping human 
conduct. 

The Force of Instinct. All men, apart from training, 
possess tendencies to respond in certain typical ways to 
certain typical situations. These tendencies to respond 
are inherent in the nature of man. Without training, this 
nature would appear to be a vastly different thing than 
most persons would imagine it to be. Thorndike, 1 in 
writing of the need of education, says, "If all human 
beings save newborn infants vanished to another planet, 
and if by a miracle the babies were kept alive for a score 
of years, preserving whatever knowledge and skill came 
from natural inner growth, and lacking only the influence 
of the educational activities of other men, they would at 
the age of twenty-one be a horde of animals." It is un- 
questionably true that any individual would be ashamed 
to be associated with the creature he himself would be by 
original nature alone. Man without the influence of 
training would show a truly barbaric type of conduct. The 
instincts of his original nature subjected to no modification 
would exhibit the cruelties, fears, and fightings of primitive 
man, and perhaps even of the lower animals themselves. 

There is in every human action and in all human con- 
duct the underlying impulse to primitive instinctive ex- 
pression. For some persons the first stage, as described 
by McDougall, represents the extent of their develop- 
ment as members of human society. Moreover, it is 
doubtless fair to say that whenever human conduct is 
particularly selfish, personal, and unsocial, unmindful of 
the rights and needs of others, the original and less 
socially useful instinctive forces are having full play; and, 
conversely, that whenever human conduct shows a sub- 
jugation of the essentially selfish, instinctive tendencies to 
the needs of social life, the influence of training is upper- 
most and the instinct of man has succumbed to the in- 
tellect of man.

York, 1912. 



48 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

The Force of Intellect. Among barbaric peoples in- 
stinct dominates; among civilized peoples instinct is in 
continual warfare with intellect. In civilized society the 
child after birth is subjected to a variety of environmental 
factors, all varying expressions of man's intellect. Train- 
ing (to include traditions, mores, etc.), education, nurture 
are the terms used to designate these factors. The quality 
and distribution of the environment determine the type 
of response seen in the members of society. The conduct 
of any one person is measured frequently in terms of his 
opportunities, other things being equal. To bring to bear 
upon the original tendencies influences that shall shape 
selfish conduct into unselfish conduct is the immediate 
aim of the social environment. To initiate such influences 
and to respond to such influences indicates the action of 
other than instinctive forces, in fact, indicates the opera- 
tion of intellect. 

The story of human development is a moving drama in 
which instinct and intellect with its ideals are the chief 
factors. Thorndike 1 describes the primacy of these ideals 
in the following passage: 

"There is a warfare of man's ideals with his original ten- 
dencies, but his ideals themselves came at some time 
from original yearnings in some men. . . . Intelligence 
and reason are fit rulers of man's instincts just because 
they are of the same flesh and blood. They are not foreign 
conquerors, imposing a law that is better because it comes 
down from above. They are sons of the soil, as indigenous 
as hunger and thirst, chosen to rule because their laws 
mean the best harmony of all the instincts." 

The Failure of Instinctive Guides. Most of the original 
tendencies in man need the modifying influence of in- 
telligence. Some instincts need to be strengthened, some 
directed into new channels for expression, and some that 
are of real worth to be curbed under certain conditions.

child is a valuable instinct not only for the child but also 
for the race. But this instinct, while admirable in its 
intent, frequently results in disaster for the child. If the 
mother is ignorant of the cause of disease her original 
tendency may mean not protection for the child, but 
definite harm. The worthwhileness of an instinct is to 
be judged not by its intent, but by its results as measured 
in human life. 

In general it seems clear that instinct alone is a failure 
in guiding human conduct. This is so for two reasons: 
the modern environment is vastly changed from the 
primitive in type, and the purely instinctive acts fail 
usually to appreciate the rights and needs of others. 

The human environment has changed markedly, es- 
pecially in the last two hundred years. It is becoming 
more and more complex and artificial, and provocative of 
unhealthful conditions in man. Instinct as a guide is lost 
in a crowded subway, in a modern restaurant, in apart- 
ment houses, in automobiles. The varied health problems 
that confront modern man require intelligence for their 
solution. This intelligence must show itself not only in 
the guidance of the individual through the maze of 
civilized forms but also in the formation by society of 
wise provisions for the welfare of all. Public health ad- 
ministration, medical inspection, scientific sanitation, in- 
struction in personal and community hygiene, adequate 
opportunities and facilities for play and recreation repre- 
sent an appreciable development of the intellect with 
reference to matters of health. Reliance on instinct to 
protect man from disease germs, to detect and cure 
disease, to properly care for waste and water supply, to 
know the proper way to live, or to develop adequately in 
an urban environment would be the height of folly. 
Instinct as a guide in modern civilized life is a failure be- 
cause of the changed environment of man. 

Instinct is a failure also because it does not appreciate 
the rights and needs of others. -This is particularly true 
in manifestations of the sex instinct. This instinct, if left

to itself, is primarily selfish, ruthless in its desire, un- 
mindful of others. In lower animals under the conditions 
that existed in their development this instinct is useful, and 
thus directed by nature it is extremely serviceable to the 
species. The story of the sock-eye salmon in breeding 
season is an epic poem of self-sacrifice for the group. In 
man, however, this instinct if uncontrolled in the highly 
developed society of modern man is productive not only 
of disease and ill health but also of unhappiness and in- 
dividual and social disaster. 

Lower forms of life may be allowed to act on a purely 
instinctive plane, but it is becoming more and more im- 
possible fo'r man to be guided only by instincts, especially 
as these guides are in their effects so particularly personal 
and individual. This control of the instinctive impulses 
to action is the sort of thing that we may expect to come 
because of the evolution of the human being. The social 
and moral significance of such control is understood more 
and more by psychologists and sociologists. McDougall 
says, "While the lower forms of social conduct are the 
direct issue of the prompting of instinct, the higher forms 
of social conduct, which alone are usually regarded as 
moral, involve the voluntary control and regulation of the 
instinctive impulses." 

Society must, therefore, by more authority in the 
regulations governing human actions provide that margin 
of safety that is not given by the thoughtless, the in- 
different, and the mentally incapacitated. It must 
stimulate the development of intelligence as a guide, and 
must renounce, either as understood or as advocated, a 
theory of education that is based on instinctive response. 

Intellect and Ideals. To plan to live by intellect and 
not by instinct involves no negation of nature. Nature is 
expressing herself as well or better through intellect than 
through instinct. Thorndike 1 in enviable fashion says, 
"Intellect is of the same flesh and blood with all the in- 

1 Thorndike, E. L.: Educational Psychology, Vol. I, p. 310, 
Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, 1919. 



INTELLIGENCE AND IDEALS 51 

stincts, a brother whose superiority lies in his power to 
appreciate, use, and save them all." 

Not alone in man's ability to reason, use tools, and 
engage in constructive work is the intellect a mark of 
superiority over the lower animals but also by the ideals 
that arise as expressions of its activity. And the very 
ideals that guide and use the instincts for superior achieve- 
ment in life arise out of the very matrix of man's intel- 
lectual life. To quote from Thorndike 1 again, "Its ideals 
are kith and kin of man's original hungers and thirsts and 
cravings. 'What are ideals about?' asks Santayana, 
with customary insight, 'what do they idealize except 
natural existence and human passions?' That would be 
a miserable and superfluous ideal that was nobody's 
ideal of nothing. The pertinence of ideals binds them to 
nature, and it is only the worst and flimsiest ideals, the 
ideals of a sick soul, that elude nature's limits, and belie 
her potentialities. Ideals are forerunners of nature's 
successes, not always followed, indeed, by their fulfilment, 
for nature is but nature, and has to feel her way; but they 
are an earnest, at least, of an achieved organization, an 
incipient accomplishment, that tends to maintain and root 
itself in the world." 

Modern man and his barbaric brother differ in ideals 
or in the extent or range of their distribution. They differ 
in no other way essentially. But the very ideals that 
characterize the intellectual life of civilized man are useful 
for purposes of life only as they foster habitual attitudes, 
directing conduct. We do not have ideals to admire, or 
to talk about vainly, or to pray over. They are to modify 
conduct. In proportion as they help to form attitudes 
tending to lead to desirable responses are they significant. 

Ideals are serviceable, then, according to the extent to 
which they direct action, especially as they foster habitual 
attitudes that lead to fine and noble responses. They are 
of relative value. An ideal of cleanliness for purposes of 
human society may not be worth as much as an ideal of 
1 Thorndike, E. L.: Loc. cit. 



52 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

fair play. All men have ideals of a kind, but we recognize 
poverty or wealth in this sphere by the quality of the 
ideal that directs and controls. The usual socialistic 
doctrine with its philosophy of the belly gives scant 
recognition to ideals in comparison with economic factors 
as guides for living. In matters of health, economic values 
too frequently set the standard for hygiene. Thus, some 
persons will be interested in living hygienically because 
it is cheaper to keep well than to pay the expense involved 
in getting well, but such guidance is frequently ineffective 
because it is not capable of directing those who are willing 
to sacrifice health and to attain ends that are selfish and 
personal. This fact is well illustrated in the following 
experience: 

A college student who was leaving college to enter a 
naval unit was recounting plans for the last night in a 
certain city. The plans involved drunkenness and vice 
in its most undesirable forms. I called to his attention 
the danger in loss of health through the debauchery of 
himself in alcohol and by the exposure to deadly venereal 
disease. His reply was characteristic of those whose 
conduct conforms to McDougall's first stage and who 
measure life in terms of economic values! "I'm willing to 
trade my health for the sake of these pleasures and enter- 
tainments." When I brought to his attention the obliga- 
tion that he owed to the race for preserving the quality of 
health that he had so that he could pass it on at least 
preserved and if possible improved, he replied, "The race 
doesn't look after me, why should I be responsible to the 
race?" The problem was, then, not to give him scientific 
knowledge of hygiene, not to point out the economic 
loss due to venereal disease. He had the knowledge and 
he was willing to trade health for what he was inclined to 
call fun. The problem was to awaken in him a response 
to social values, to a spirit of chivalry toward not only 
women and men but also toward those who come after. 
Acutely it resolved itself into indicating the ways in which 
the race looked after him, and in arousing in him a sense 



INTELLIGENCE AND IDEALS 53 

of responsibility toward the race. He greatly needed 
ideals that would help to place him as an individual in the 
scheme of things. 

The instinctive guide even when buttressed by economic 
supports may fail; it always fails in the crisis of life. 
McDougall 1 points out so clearly the fallacy in such con- 
trol that it is worth while to quote him at length: "The 
regulation of conduct by the regard for the approval or 
disapproval of our fellowmen has certain limitations and 
drawbacks. In the first place the motives involved are 
fundamentally egoistic. Second, the approval or disap- 
proval of our social circle cease to be effective sanctions of 
right conduct as soon as we can be quite sure that our 
lapse from the standard demanded of us will never be 
known to those in whose minds we habitually see our- 
selves reflected." 

It is well known that the individual living on this low 
plane will not conform if there is no danger of being 
"found out." To remedy this defect many people have 
supplemented the sanction of public opinion with the 
theologic doctrine of an all-seeing eye an omnipotent one 
who rewards and punishes. This doctrine is increasingly 
less potent today. For purposes of life we shall have to 
depend more and more upon ideals, and for purposes 
of health, to live most and to serve best may well satisfy the 
needs of health and the larger goals of life. 

The problem of living finely is in part a problem of 
seeing straight, and seeing straight is nothing less than 
getting in touch and harmony with the great principles of 
law that rule the universe. One of these principles is the 
essential unity of life, and carries with it not only the in- 
heritance of the past, but, for the individual, a real re- 
sponsibility for future generations. This means ideals of 
a high order. To the intense individualist, to the selfish 
seeker of personal pleasures, and to certain types of social- 
ists this principle means nothing.

It would have been helpful if I could have told my 
college student the story of Gloria Swann. 1 Gloria, a 
chorus girl, longed to be clever as she saw cleverness 
around her. After passing through a significant change 
of attitude toward life in which she sensed the relation of 
each individual to the race, she arrived at a great thought. 
One night she heard one of the girls of the chorus recount- 
ing a rather questionable experience of the evening before. 
It brought forth to Gloria's mind this contemplation: 
"Four thousand generations have kept the light burning 
for her, and now she's letting the wick go sooty like 
that." 

The Problem of Health and Ideals. It is important to 
emphasize the fact that the problems of hygienic living 
touch the whole life. Hygiene cannot be considered in 
water-tight compartments. The control of appetite, the 
development of habits, the selection of preferred forms of 
recreation are shaped by ideals. It is also important to 
emphasize that ideals must give rise to habitual attitudes. 
The way one responds today determines pretty largely 
the way one will respond tomorrow to the same situation, 
other things being equal. The power to show control in 
great moments is gained by the use of control in less 
significant times presenting like demands. Habitual re- 
sponse is the factor to reckon with. If the situation S, 
has been followed by response R, without annoyance, the 
bond S-R in the nervous system has been strengthened, 
and in the future S will readily give rise to R, other things 
being equal. 2 

Health habits are dependent upon this very law of 
neurone action, and ideals, in the service of health and 
fine living, must act by arousing a definite attitude toward 
definite specific problems. An ideal of health as a quality 
of life rendering the individual fit to live most and to serve 
best will foster attitudes serving the individual and the

group. Both must be served. Abundant life and gen- 
erous service are the hope of society. Alone either is 
worth very little. 

A Social Ideal. An ideal of social responsibility is the 
need of the times. Human conduct will be acceptable 
when the responsibility of the individual to society, to 
the past, and to the future for the whole of life has been 
met. Such an ideal of social responsibility is the need 
of education today. Communities and states and 
even the nation itself must reorganize education spirit- 
ually. This does not mean merely new attention to 
forms of worship, but it does mean emphasis on the 
religion of service for the common weal and a standard 
of social honor that puts the health and happiness of 
all first, and the individual needs or desires second. 
It is a question of attitude or mood in which we are 
taught. 

Galsworthy 1 suggests the same thought when he says: 
"Now the sole hope that the future may be better than 
the past or present centers around the possibility of sub- 
stituting for that bankrupt ideal (maximum production of 
wealth to the square mile) the ideal of the maximum 
production of health and happiness; for whatever the 
fashion of our speech and the complexion of our thought, 
this is not precisely the same thing." 

Again he says, "If there be a saving way at all, it is 
obviously this: substitute health and happiness for 
wealth as a world ideal; and translate that new ideal into 
action by education from babyhood up." 

An ideal of social responsibility must be a developed 
ideal, the result of education in the home and in the 
school. It is not instinctive, although it arises out of the 
same soil that provides the instincts. The evolution of 
the moral sense is essentially the carrying over from one 
generation to another of the modes of actions, the typical 
responses demanded by an organized society and con-

ruary, 1920, p. 173. 



56 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

sidered by one generation to be worth perpetuation in the 
succeeding one. 1 

In the lower animals there is no carrying over of moral 
codes and standards. Sacrifice of self for others, when it 
occurs, is an unconscious act; but in man such action, 
representing the finest expression of the moral sense, is 
conscious. Because man is conscious, a being of intellect, 
a fashioner of ideals, and because ideals are not inherited 
tendencies like the instincts, the teaching of ideals of so- 
cial conduct is of tremendous importance for the welfare 
of the race, and is of more significance in race culture than 
mere legislative laws governing marriage, child bearing, 
and social behavior. 

For the individual there is no essential conflict between 
what is good for the individual and what is good for the 
race. That program of living which is most wholesome 
for the individual is also most propitious for racial progeny. 

An ideal of social responsibility strikes at the selfishness 
that leads to loss of health; it cuts right across the super- 
ficial and shallow in living and reaches down into the 
facts and truths of nature. In this sense it immeasurably 
enriches individual human life if values are not mixed. 
The woman who refuses to bear children because of some 
of the personal deprivations and losses that come has 
retained her maidenly figure perhaps; she has not missed 
the regular sessions of her club; she has not interrupted 
the round of parties, entertainments, and amusements; 
but she has lost in very vital ways by substituting a lap- 
dog for the human offspring. Ultimately, therefore, the 
motive of social responsibility enriches life if one only 
sees straight. For the selfish, vain, and indolent, for the 
snob, feminist, and social parasite, the values that mean 
racial improvement, racial vigor, rich racial inheritance 
are not very appealing. 

On the other hand, human culture, human improve- 
ment, hygienic and fine living will be guided by values

that root themselves in the nature of man as represented 
by the social evolution of the race. The growing social 
consciousness and sense of obligation to others that 
characterize man and mark him off from the lower animals 
is a fact of such importance that its full significance when 
applied to the problem of human culture has never been 
adequately emphasized. It is certain, however, that 
nothing very lasting will come out of the health move- 
ment so long as its appeal is selfish and directed merely at 
prevention of disease. 1 The spectacle of a nation having 
plenty of food and going without so that other nations 
could live was possible because of the great dramatic 
ideal presented by the World War. The continual drama- 
tization in the schools of an ideal of race culture, of an 
ideal of social responsibility is a crying need of the times. 
An Ideal of Social Responsibility Arises Out of the 
Nature of Life. The ideal of social responsibility bears no 
false document of identity. It arises out of the very 
nature of life and human society. It serves faithfully the 
origin, development, and purpose of human life, because, 

1. Each individual is a link in the entire chain of life, 

2. Each individual is an heir to an inheritance of life, 
both biologic and social, and by the same token each in- 
dividual is a trustee of the same goods for posterity, and 
therefore, 

3. Each individual is responsible for the preservation of 
the quality of life received from ancestral stock and with 
other members of society, for the preservation of the social 
environment conducive to health and happiness. More- 
over, this responsibility implies not only preservation of 
life and opportunities received, but whenever possible 
progressive improvement. Health as a quality of life 
challenges each individual to make that health finer, 
richer, more complete, and abundant; it challenges men 
and women to preserve wholesome opportunities for living 
and to make them increasingly more abundant and useful.

Sons, New York, 1921. 



58 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

To make clear the full implications of the above state- 
ments is a matter of importance. 

Each Individual is a Link in the Chain of Life. If we 
trace life back through the countless ages of the past we 
find one fundamental fact of nature. The impulse of life, 
of living matter represented in each individual, is an im- 
pulse forging for the period of that one's life a link in the 
chain of all life. 1 So numerous are the links and so varied 
the chain that one is inclined to consider one's life as the 
beginning and end of the life one represents. Such is not 
the case. The individual represents many forces that 
have worked in the lives of his ancestors, and in a way he 
represents a mosaic of them. If it is a beautiful mosaic, 
it is strongly incumbent upon him to preserve its lines and 
colors, and if possible to so care for this inheritance that 
it will be improved with age. Such an inheritance one 
should value more highly than the inheritance of a silver 
spoon in the family for generations, or a social position 
attained by chance and held with difficulty. 

On the other hand, if the mosaic be cracked, here is an 
obligation indeed. It must not be injured more, and if 
possible the defect should be remedied. Such an inherit- 
ance may be improved by proper living; perchance, by 
proper marriage the defect may not be so marked in the 
next generation. In any case, in the field of human life, 
there is a wonderful laboratory for the performing of ex- 
periments in which there can be adequate controls, suffi- 
cient guidance, and definite records. 

Each Individual is an Heir to the Inheritance of Life. 
It is only a step from the appreciation of the fact that 
the individual is a link in the chain of life to the compre- 
hension of the importance of this fact for a generation 
and a nation. We, citizens of these United States of 
America, today are laying the foundations for the life of 
those who shall live in our places and do the work we have 
been doing. We have been concerned recently with 

x Bergson (Henri), in his Creative Evolution, expresses the thought 
given here. He elaborates and develops it in a- most satisfying way. 



INTELLIGENCE AND IDEALS 59 

keeping liberty alive in the world, with preserving the 
unity of this nation, with making "the world safe for 
democracy." 

We have preserved our liberty and our unity, we have 
helped make the world safe for democracy, but it is also 
important that we assign to our heirs not only freedom 
from political slavery but also freedom from the ravages 
of disease; not only freedom from aggression by an arro- 
gant military power but also freedom from insidious drains 
on our vitality. 1 

Responsibility for Life. Acceptance of the biologic re- 
latedness of men and women 2 and the inheritance of life 
possibilities lead logically to a standard of social respon- 
sibility. To live most and to serve best is to recognize this 
standard. But the sense of responsibility for others must 
not become a meddlesome habit of benevolent paternal- 
ism. The individual must achieve health and happi- 
ness; they are not to achieve him. The control by organ- 
ized society should be exercised only to protect the 
majority in matters approved by the majority. Mem- 
bers of society who cannot respond to approved standards 
of living either must be helped to respond acceptably or 
made harmless to prevent the realization of effective 
living by others. 

Autocratic principles in the service of others suffer in 
a modern world the fate of autocracy everywhere. But 
where control is clearly needed and clearly sanctioned, as 
in communicable diseases, purity of food and water- 
supply, sanitation of public places, care of excreta and 
garbage, there should be no half-hearted acceptance of 
the responsibility. Such administrative control should be 
accompanied by educational efforts to sanction and secure 
the gains for the group. 

Ideals are not always immediately achieved. Woodrow

Wilson went to Versailles in 1918; the Washington Con- 
ference was held in 1921. To work toward ideal and 
intelligent controls that will overcome superstition, ignor- 
ance, and the unworthy instinctive impulses in man is 
the path to progress. But inability of any group to rise 
to the heights of idealism involved in the solution of a 
problem may make it necessary for the Federal Govern- 
ment to step in and protect the individual as an asset of 
the state. With the Government the holding of ideals 
is just as valuable as for the individual. It is important 
to state, however, that ideals exist for government in 
proportion as they serve to guide the people of a nation. 
We call this force that shapes laws and regulations public 
opinion. Public opinion is forceful, it is powerful, and 
yet it is so simple that when once the people of the nation 
find themselves holding with conviction an opinion, an 
ideal, in a very short time it is translated into law. 

It is conceivable, therefore, that an ideal of social 
responsibility may become so forceful in individual lives, 
and a conviction concerning human duty may become so 
strong, that there will result not only improved personal 
living but also more effective sanitary control of disease, 
more thorough and complete health work in the schools, 
desirable improvement's hi housing laws and regulations, 
increased protection for workers in hazardous trades, and 
better methods for controlling the appalling death-rate of 
infants. Ideals should mean more and not less health; 
more and not less happiness. 

An Ideal of Social Responsibility Serves All. The 
ideal of social responsibility involves no real hardships, 
but it presents no royal road. It will always lead the way 
to new accomplishments, sometimes by new roads through 
unbroken ground, sometimes by connecting old path- 
ways. It will doubtless help to correct some prevailing 
attitudes. For youth and for old age happiness is held 
in high esteem, and for some an ideal of responsibility to 
society smacks of all that is destructive of happiness as 
they know it. These foolish ones think of happiness in 



INTELLIGENCE AND IDEALS 61 

terms of dance halls, horse races, and lobster palaces. 
They spend their energy to produce wealth with the 
avowed purpose of buying amusement which they call 
happiness. They miss the subtle fact that happiness can- 
not be bought, that it cannot be conferred; that it must 
be earned, it must be won. Though they travel over the 
earth to find happiness, they will miss it unless they carry 
it with them in their hearts. Happiness, like health, 
flows from life as a by-product of activities that are 
worth while and satisfying. 

But for both youth and old age an ideal of social re- 
sponsibility may have real meaning. To the youth able 
biologically to preserve and to pass on to future genera- 
tions desirable human qualities, such an ideal comes as a 
challenge that he may accept, knowing that he will need 
all that he possesses of fortitude and courage. To the 
one who has passed the meridian of life the appeal is con- 
cerned chiefly with the influence of living that is to be 
exerted and with the preservation of the best treasures of 
the social inheritance. Custom, tradition, the mores of 
the people are powerful forces determining largely the 
kind of response that posterity will give. Social in- 
heritance is as important as the facts of organic heredity. 1 

For both, young and old, such an ideal will quicken and 
give meaning to life. Both may become interested in 
passing on an inheritance, biologic or social, that shall be 
a fulfilment of trusteeship. To bequeath to immediate or 
distant offspring biologic and social jewels is incomparably 
superior to the oft valued bequest of battered silver 
spoons, pewter plates, or old clocks. 

The Significance of Social Pressure in Relation to 
Ideals. Ideals vary. Some persons have many, some 
have none; and no one is compelled to hold any particular 
ideal and no one can force an ideal upon another. Ideals 
are achieved; they belong; they can never be legislated 
into being nor made to live by edict or pronouncement.

versity Press, New Haven, 1915.

And just because this is so we shall have need often to 
remind ourselves of this variability in human beings. In 
such fashion we shall want to reinterpret that hallowed 
phase of the Declaration of Independence that "All men 
are created free and equal." Now, the facts are just the 
opposite. Persons are not equal at all. They have vary- 
ing capacities for growth and development. In a sense 
we are equal before the law, but to say that political 
equality alone is meant begs the question, since "I am 
just as good as you are" accurately depicts the common 
attitudes on equality. It ought to be quite clear that 
equality is not conferred nor provided by government. 
Equality, like so many precious things in life, must be 
won. The only test is that of worthy achievement. 

Since ideals cannot be compelled, but must be won, 
since equality cannot be conferred, but must be achieved, 
since happiness cannot be bought, but must be earned, 
since all the worthwhile things of life come from living in 
the right way, it is important that society be careful to 
provide for each individual the most appropriate and best 
life opportunities possible. Such provision may require 
social pressure by the group. 

In speaking of the aims of education some might call 
them ideals Thorndike 1 with characteristic clearness 
describes the way social pressure is commonly exerted. 
He writes : 

"No one is compelled by any inner necessity to accept 
as his aim in education for himself or his fellow-men the 
improvement and satisfaction of human wants the 
cultivation of a good will, impersonal pleasures, knowledge 
of things and men, habits of open-mindedness, and physical 
and mental efficiency, and only the best individuals do 
accept these aims. Fagin tried to debase Oliver's wants 
and to satisfy his own at the cost of everyone else's. 
Manufacturers may try to fit the children of a community 
to be nothing save efficient workmen. Baptists may plan

York, 1912. 



INTELLIGENCE AND IDEALS 63 

their schools in utter defiance of Methodist and Presby- 
terian wants. A parent may count the satisfaction of his 
child's vanity above the satisfaction of a hundred other 
children's rights. 

''Social pressure is required to prevent folly and in- 
justice in education as elsewhere. Fagin can, if he likes, 
consider no wants save his own, but all men acting to- 
gether can, if they like, hang him therefor. Parents may, 
if they like, consider no wants save their child's, but other 
families can have that child expelled from the school, or 
the parents from the community. Manufacturers can 
vote to take money from high schools for trade-schools, 
but others vote also. The state can suppress sectarian 
schools altogether if it thinks that an unfair discrimination 
among wants is made by them." 

Ideals are essential for the realization of the best in life; 
they are, therefore, essential for all living. They are, in 
the intelligent life, well supported by truth, by the facts 
of life. They keep their feet on the ground. They do not 
confuse the ought and the is, but by using the materials of 
life they seek constantly to achieve higher levels.

those forms, and the way in which environment has 
molded and controlled the development of the body. 
The science of hygiene must, therefore, be based upon the 
knowledge of the nature of the human organism if it is to 
be something more than tradition, custom, and super- 
stition. It is interesting in this respect to remember that 
the beliefs of many peoples regarding the care of the 
body are not scientific, and in proportion as they are 
merely traditional they are of less value in producing 
hygienic living. Beliefs among the more ignorant negroes, 
the peasant Chinese, the wild tribes of Borneo and the 
Philippines instance the influence of superstition as a 
guide in living. The ignorant negro will give more 
credence to a superstitious belief, as a rule, than to a 
scientific viewpoint. This is due to the comparatively 
short period this race has been in contact with forces of 
education. It is interesting in this connection to note 

64

that negroes in college and university, representing as 
they do the highest types of their race, accept and practice 
as faithfully the dictates of science as the more socially 
favored white races. 

The Biologic Basis of Life. To understand man's 
nature it is essential to know the biologic basis of man's 
life, and the way in which he attained unto the kind of 
being he is today. The simplest and lowest forms of 
animal life are the Protozoa. These are single unicellular 
organisms and represent in structure the units of structure 
in the human body. As life evolved higher forms we see 
at a higher level the group of animals called the Ccelen- 
terata, examples of which are hydras, sea-anemones, jelly- 
fishes, and coral animals. They are so-called because they 
are distinguished by having a crelum, or body cavity, which 
serves as a digestive sac. Such tissues as nerve and muscle 
are not present, or very poorly developed, and the systems 
of circulation, respiration, and excretion are entirely ab- 
sent, although the functions of these systems are carried on. 

At a still higher level in the scale of development of life- 
forms emerges the type illustrated by the lower flat 
worms. Here for the first time appears muscular tissue 
in significant amount. The muscles are arranged in 
circular and longitudinal fashion around the trunk of the 
worm and serve for locomotion. 

The appearance of the muscular system increased the 
range of locomotor activity for the animals so endowed; 
it made possible a richer environment; but it required 
marked specialization of the body cells. In proportion as 
the muscle cell gained ability to do specialized work it 
lost ability to care for all the processes that are required 
in living tissue. 1 This specialization of certain cells re- 
quired that other cells take up the work of supplying the 
muscle cells with food and of removing the waste occa- 
sioned by their activity. Thus it is that special cells ap- 
peared to furnish the food and oxygen needed by the 

1 Bigelow, M. A. and A. N.: Introduction to Biology, The Mac- 
millan Co., New York, 1913, Chap. II. 



66 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

muscles, and other special cells took unto themselves the 
work of removing the waste. This is the beginning of the 
circulatory and excretory systems. 

Professor Tyler 1 expresses this change when he says, 
"We must never forget that the development of the 
muscular system carried with it, or dragged after it, the 
development of our most important viscera, kidneys, 
lungs, heart, and blood-vessels and, as we shall see later, 
of the brain itself." 

The contraction of muscle is dependent upon a stimulus 
that will cause it to act so that muscle cells required the 
addition to the very simple nervous system of correspond- 
ing nerve-fibers. The increased power of locomotion 
brought the animal into new environment and new situa- 
tions, and from now on through fishes, reptiles, lower 
mammals, as the cat and dog, arboreal mammals, as the 
ape up to man, the whole history of the developing life is 
the history of an increase in complexity and function of 
the nervous system. The brain, as the final and most 
complex structure to develop, presents an organ of wonder- 
ful usefulness to man. It exercises control over the other 
centers of the nervous system and hence over all the 
parts of the body. Part of this control goes on without 
the knowledge of its action on our part and irrespective of 
our will in the matter. It is impossible to make the heart 
stop beating by thinking or to make the liver secrete bile 
by reading about it. This control over the vital organs of 
life is automatic and involuntary, and although we know 
conditions that would modify the type of reaction that 
occurs, we are limited greatly in an effort to guide the 
response. We have through the development of con- 
sciousness and the will a certain power over the muscles 
of the body and, in accordance with the way in which 
the organs of the body arose, we are able most effectively 
to reach their processes through the action of the skeletal 
muscles of the body.

Boston, 1907, p. 26. 



THE APPROACH FOR KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH 67 

The outline given here aims to be brief, and yet the facts 
are so important that they must be adequately stated. 
For this purpose we quote Tyler 1 again: 

"The human body is composed of many distinct systems 
and organs, all indissolubly united in one organism, where 
'every part is at once means and end to every other part.' 
The health and life of the whole organism may be dis- 
turbed or destroyed by the weakness of any one of these 
numerous parts. What we often call the lower organs, 
the viscera, are absolutely essential to life, and hence by 
far the most important. They are fundamental as well 
as essential. Anything which disturbs our digestion or 
the removal of waste equally disturbs the clearness and 
vigor of our thought. Every part must be of the highest 
possible efficiency. One great aim of education should be 
to 'make the weakest part as strong as the rest/ If 
there is to be no schism in the body the organs must be 
properly balanced in weight and power. Otherwise the 
overgrown part robs some other organ of its fair share of 
nutriment, and throws upon it burdens which it cannot 
bear. If any part is, for any reason, to be exposed to ex- 
cessive strain, that part must be fortified and strengthened 
during its period of growth in early life. But every other 
part should be correspondingly strengthened to back it 
up in its emergency. 

"It is hardly possible that in so complex a being as man 
all parts and organs should develop with equal rapidity 
at one and the same time. . . . We should expect to find 
that there is a special time for the rapid development of 
each organ. We should naturally expect that the more 
fundamental organs, like those of digestion, excretion, 
and respiration, will develop early to meet the needs of 
other growing parts, and that some will be held back to 
give time and opportunity for this important process. 

"We cannot fail to notice the immense amount of time 
devoted by nature to the development of the muscular 
system. Why did she linger sa long over it before going 
i Tyler, J. M.: Loc. cit., p. 38. 



68 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

on to the development of the brain, especially of the 
cortex, with its mental powers? Evidently it must be of 
far greater importance and have far larger latent capaci- 
ties than we have usually supposed. The muscular 
system is the strategic center, so to speak, from and 
through which we can reach, exercise, and strengthen the 
intestines, lungs, kidneys, and all the organs essential to 
life, but which are beyond the direct control of the will. 
Hence the sturdy vigor of our ancestors and the dangers 
of a sedentary life. 

"We have found that different portions of our muscular 
system have arisen at different ages, and that they grow 
younger as we go out from the trunk to the ends of the 
fingers and downward to the toes. The central and funda- 
mental are older than the peripheral and accessory." 

Professor Tyler describes how these muscles are con- 
trolled by nerve-centers, and explains that the centers in 
control of the muscles of the trunk are older, tougher, and 
have more endurance than those of the muscles of the 
extremities. To quote him 1 again: 

"Therefore we are not surprised to find that the best 
physiologists insist upon the fullest possible development 
of these fundamental centers. They are the seats of en- 
durance which enable us to hold out against the strain of 
modern life, especially in the hurry and fret of our great 
cities. They must be strengthened at all cost in the 
children of parents who show any signs of traces of 
nervous weakness, in all the children of the business and 
professional classes, and in those children who will later 
enter these lines of work. The high-strung American girl 
needs this preventive and developing treatment more than 
any other form or kind of education. No child can have 
too much of it, and in every case it is far better to have 
full enough than too little." 

Evidence from Biology a Guide for Hygiene. It is of 
very great importance to point out that the digestive 
system developed in relation to needs arising in the body,

chiefly the needs of the muscles. It used food that was 
altered little before digestion. However varied in kind 
the food was among different races of man, it nevertheless 
retained in all a prevailing coarseness and simplicity. 
Civilized man has changed both his physical life and the 
character of his food supply. It will never be possible for 
him, as he is constituted, to live an essentially vigorous 
life and digest his food with ease and efficiency, without 
a wholesome participation in physical activity and with- 
out the use of natural food. A good deal of discomfort and 
lack of appreciation of the problem of feeding the human 
man would be avoided if this simple principle were under- 
stood and acted upon. It is interesting to read what 
James 1 says regarding the development of a type of man 
that will not require a strong muscular system and will 
be free from adequately chewing coarse wholesome food. 
His description of this type follows: 

"I recollect years ago reading a certain work by an 
American doctor on hygiene and the laws of life and the 
type of future humanity. I have forgotten its author's 
name and title, but I remember well an awful prophecy 
that it contained about the future of the muscular system. 
Human perfection, the writer said, means ability to cope 
with the environment; but the environment will more and 
more require mental power from us, and less and less will 
ask for brute strength. Wars will cease, machines will do 
all our heavy work, man will become more and more a 
mere director of nature's energies, and less and less an 
exerter of energy on his own account. So that if the homo 
sapiens of the future can only digest his food and think, 
what need will he have of well-developed muscles at all? 
And why, pursued the writer, should we not even now be 
satisfied with a more delicate and intellectual type of 
beauty than that which pleased our ancestors? Nay, I 
have heard a fanciful friend make a still further advance 
in this 'new-man' direction. With our future food, he

says, itself prepared in liquid form from the chemical 
elements of the atmosphere, pepsinated or half-digested 
in advance, and sucked up through a glass tube from a 
tin can, what need shall we have of teeth or stomachs 
even? They may go along with our muscles or our physical 
courage, while, challenging even more and more our 
proper admiration, will grow the gigantic domes of our 
crania, arching over our spectacled eyes, and animating our 
flexible little lips to those floods of learned and ingenious 
talk which will constitute our most congenial occupation." 

Contrariwise, the future of homo sapiens will depend 
neither upon his ability to do without exercise nor to 
subsist upon tablets of food elements, but rather upon his 
ability to harmonize the demands of his biologic nature 
with the requirements of civilized life. 

Professor Snedden 1 has pointed out some of the sig- 
nificant changes in civilization that bring to the biologic 
organism serious demands on its adjustment capacity. He 
says that man 

1. Early took on erect stature and ceased vegetarianism. 

2. Disposed of hair and took on clothing. 

3. Ranged the world and assembled many kinds of pathogenic 

bacteria. 

4. Took to work which overtaxes eyes and nerves. 

5. Developed much "sitting," thus encouraging insufficient use 

of torsal structure. 

6. Developed concentrated and cooked foods, thus encouraging 

partial atrophy of teeth and jaw structure. 

7. Developed means of artificial heat, thus reducing climatic 

stimuli. 

8. Lives much under cover, thus reducing stimulating or chem- 

ical values of air breathed. 

9. Has postponed marriage, thus imposing a period of severe 

sexual strain between sexual maturity and time of approved 
marriage. 

10. Has developed routine toil instead of the intermittent work of 

the ancestors. 

11. Has made of some men (formerly) and many women creatures 

of decoration rather than useful social functions. 

12. Has substituted for the close concrete fears of the primitives 

the "long range" intellectualized apprehensions and solici- 
tudes (worries) of provident life.

University, 1921. 



THE APPROACH FOR KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH 71 

It is not important to agree with all of these suggested 
changes, but it is important to understand that modern 
life has thrown upon the biologic organism severe strains, 
and to understand further the fundamental needs for the 
preservation of the health and vigor of the body. 

The Human Body and its Adjustment. The biologic 
evidence indicates that man's evolution has brought an 
inheritance of structure and function that requires thought- 
ful care and attention by the individual and society to 
devise ways and means of meeting the artificial conditions 
imposed by civilization. The experience of man indicates 
everywhere that the fundamental biologic needs cannot 
be ignored. Fortunately, the increased interest in health 
today is helping to overcome some of these environmental 
handicaps. One may be the veriest tyro in hygiene and 
yet know of the efforts everywhere to combat the dangers 
that Snedden suggests. The interest in posture, the era 
of wholesome dress, the development of serums, the 
establishment of isolation measures, the play and recrea- 
tion movement, the crusade against the sedentary life, 
the agitation for coarse, wholesome food, the open air and 
camping programs, the keen interest in and study of social 
hygiene, the emphasis on the importance of physical 
work, the recognition of athletics for men and women both, 
the development of instruction in mental hygiene all 
attest to the appreciation of the problems presented by 
civilized life. It is most fortunate that these movements 
are adjustive, that they are based on biologic needs, and 
are not trying to develop a type of man like the one to 
which William James has referred. Many of the false 
standards of civilization with their emphasis on the 
maximum production of wealth will be changed. The 
biologic adjustment will be made easier with the advent 
of more rational attitudes. 

The Human Body an Energy Mechanism. The ability 
of the body to adjust itself to new situations as well as to 
function properly in old and familiar ones is related to its 
ability to release and use energy. The individual with 



72 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

abundant energy may not always meet the problems of 
living satisfactorily either from a personal or social view- 
point, but surplus energy is a necessity for the best 
volitional control and, hence, for rational action. Its 
release and expenditure determine largely man's ability to 
adjust to the various problems presented in complex 
modern life. The energy aspects of life are set forth 
clearly by Osborn 1 : 

"So far as the creative power of energy is concerned, we are on 
sure ground! In physics energy controls matter and form; in physi- 
ology function controls the organ; in animal mechanics motion con- 
trols, and in a sense creates, the form of muscles and bones. In 
every instance some kind of energy or work precedes some kind of 
form, rendering it probable that energy also precedes and controls 
the evolution of life." 

For a long time the body has been considered as an 
organism with ability to receive, store, and express 
energy. The manifestations of life in action have always 
appealed as energy manifestations, but the known and 
unknown chemical reactions going on in the body, while 
seemingly on an energy basis, have never been fully under- 
stood. The phenomena of growth and development have 
always been obscure even when we had information about 
hormones and the power of certain internal glands to 
control the metabolic changes going on in the body. It is 
extremely valuable to set forth the way in which this 
control is exercised. Obsorn says, "every physiochemical 
action and reaction concerned in the transformation, con- 
servation, and dissipation of energy produces also, either 
as a direct result or as a by-product, a physiochemical 
agent of interaction which permeates and affects the 
organism as a whole or affects only some special 
part." 

By an agent of interaction is meant a force connecting 
the force of action and reaction. It refers to what is going 
on between parts and is similar in type to the interaction 

1 Osborn, H. F. : The Origin and Evolution of Life, Charles Scrib- 
ner's Sons, New York, 1919, pp. 10, 11. 



THE APPROACH FOR KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH 73 

between a driver and a driven horse by means of the reins. 
A nerve impulse in this sense is an interacting agent, since 
it connects the action of a distant nerve-cell with the re- 
sponse of a muscle in vigorous contraction. A hormone 
produced in cells in one part of the body and passing in 
the blood may affect the activity of cells far remote. 
Osborn 1 goes on to say: 

"Through such interaction the organism is made a unit and acts 
as one, because the activities of all its parts are correlated. Since 
it is known that many actions and reactions of the organism such 
as those of general and localized growth of nutrition, of respiration 
are co-ordinated with other actions and reactions through inter- 
action, it is but a step to extend the principle and suppose that all 
actions and reactions are similarly co-ordinated; and that while 
there was an evolution of action and reaction there was also a corre- 
sponding evolution of interaction, for without this the organism 
would not evolve harmoniously." 

To quote Osborn 2 again, "Evidence for such universality 
of the interaction principle has been accumulating rapidly 
of late, especially in experimental medicine and in experi- 
mental biology." 

The experiments of Morgan and Goodale bear this out. 
Loeb, 3 in his recent book, Movements, Tropisms, and 
Animal Conduct, shows the evidence from the biologic 
laboratory. The actions of animals are determined by 
the influence bearing upon the many sensory receptors. 
The response to the stimulus is determined by the energy 
available. These facts mean for those who would live 
most and serve best that energy should be abundant at all 
times as a guarantee of the best adjustment, the best 
choice. 

It should be noted further that the tissues and organs 
of the body are especially adapted to receive, store, or 
express energy. This characteristic is especially valuable, 
for it enables a balance and control to exist in the body 
without which there would be no harmony either in 

1 Osborn, H. F.: Loc. cit., p. 16.

74 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

development or in action. Osborn 1 again states this point 
in excellent phrase: 

"All visible tissues, organs, and structures are seen to be the more 
or less simple or elaborate agents of the different modes of energy. 
One after another of the special groups of tissues and organs are 
created and co-ordinated organs for the capture of energy from the 
inorganic environment and from the life environment, organs for 
the storage of energy, organs for the transformation of energy from 
the potential state into the states of motion and heat. Other agents 
of control are evolved to bring about a harmonious balance between 
the various organs and tissues in which energy is released, hastened 
or accekrated, slowed down or retarded) or actually arrested or 
inhibited." 

The method of energy manifestations is being gradually 
explained and understood. We are beginning to under- 
stand that all actions and reactions, dependent for their 
power upon energy, are co-ordinated; they control and 
modify the organism in accordance with the influence that 
the particular actions give. This gives us the scientific 
background for the teaching that our actions today de- 
termine in a very definite way the kind of response we will 
give tomorrow. This has been stated by Bergson 2 and 
some time ago by James. James says 3 in this connection: 

"What he shall become is fixed by the conduct of this 
moment." 

Energy plays an important part here, especially in all 
ethical situations. To quote James again: 

"The ethical energy par excellence has to go farther and 
choose which interest out of several, equally coercive, 
shall become supreme." 

Thus energy, abundant energy, lies at the very root of 
life. It fixes largely the choices made; it qualifies the 
vision. Only with abundant energy co-ordinating the 
body functions is the immediate thrusting appeal of the 
moment turned aside for the distant view, the higher goal. 

The more recent studies in medicine, biology, physics,

THE APPROACH FOR KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH 75 

and chemistry indicate, therefore, that the human body 
is not to be thought of as an aggregation of cells and 
organs that act irrespective of the control afforded by an 
interacting mechanism, but rather should it be considered 
a unified whole, guided at times by a -circulating substance 
in the blood, at other times by an impulse from nerve- 
cells. There may be other ways in which the control and 
balance of the body is maintained, but at present we are 
familiar only with these forms. The human body, like 
all bodies for that matter, is an energy mechanism. It 
acts without reference to its size and is, except in the case 
of some muscular actions, not dependent upon its size. 
The amount of released energy in the individual is de- 
pendent more upon the activity of his nerve tissue and 
the character of his internal secretions than upon his 
height or weight. The human body is dependent upon the 
same food sources for energy that serve the other animals, 
and the availability of these sources controls in large 
measure the amount and character of the energy expressed 
in the life of the individual. 

Sources of Energy. Ultimately the source of all energy 
for man is the sun, according to the theory of photosyn- 
thesis. Lavoisier and de Saussure laid the foundation of 
the understanding that the action of solar heat and light 
is a perpetual source of living energy. But for man it is 
perhaps equally important to recall the following con- 
ception of the cycle of elements that passes through plants 
and animals: The animal is sustained by the plant and 
the plant, in turn, is dependent upon the animal for the 
waste that forms the source of certain essentials in plant 
metabolism. The energy of the sun is captured by the 
plant through the chlorophyl and is stored in food. 

The plant with chlorophyl is able through the action 
of the solar energy to form carbohydrates. In addition, 
fats and protein are manufactured in the plant and 
mineral compounds are absorbed from the soil. The 
chlorophyl action is very interesting. The leaves of the 
plant with chlorophyl in the presence of sunlight separate 



76 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

oxygen atoms from the carbon in the molecules of carbon 
dioxid (C0 2 ) and hydrogen atoms from the water (H 2 O), 
storing up the energy of the hydrogen and carbon products 
in the carbohydrate substance of the plant. 

In this way the starches and sugars of the plant deposit 
their stored energy in the tissues of the plant. Such energy 
is avilable for the animal and will be released to the animal 
by the addition of oxygen in the cells. This is an important 
fact, that the energy of food requires oxygen for its utiliza- 
tion and will be released when oxygen is brought in con- 
tact with it. It is thus seen that the energy of the sun 
transformed into the chemical potential energy of the 
elements, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, is transmitted 
by the addition of oxygen in the animal into motion, heat, 
or functional activity of glands. 

The sources of human energy, therefore, are the plants 
and oxygen. Other animals serve to yield food energy 
for man, but they, in turn, are dependent upon this same 
source. An understanding of simple plant physiology, 
therefore, frees us in part from the exigency of attributing 
to a mysterious power the phenomena of growth, develop- 
ment, and action. 

But are there other sources of human energy than those 
involved in the chemical action and reaction that ap- 
proximates the test-tube experiment, and are we left in a 
hopeless materialistic position if we are unable to attribute 
to a Supreme Power the actions of life and the phenomena 
of growth and development? In many ways we are im- 
measurably enriched, because we are not acting on sup- 
position, but on fact as determined by experiment. 1 We 
have no need to postulate mysterious forces either to 
explain man's action or to interpret the record of his 
growth. The mechanisms 2 available in man and sensitive 
to the changing situations in life are capable of releasing 
energy at moments of great demand. Proper attitude 

1 Conklin makes an excellent statement of this view with reference 
to development of the body in Heredity and Environment, pp. 43-51.

Appleton & Co., New York, 1916. 



THE APPROACH FOR KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH 77 

toward any situation will result in the proper response, 
and for this response the whole of life is prepared to act. 

It is important to state, therefore, that we have no 
evidence that there is any force acting on the body to 
determine its response except as it acts by stimulating 
the varied mechanisms of the body. Thus any situation 
that produces a state which is called emotion also produces 
profound internal changes in the body which are a part of 
the response. The enormous strength exhibited by man 
under the influence of a situation provoking the external 
signs of fear or anger is not due to any force that has en- 
tered the body, but to a group of internal changes char- 
acterized by a free release of energy that was present in 
the body all the time. 1 A Supreme Power does not act by 
bringing some force into the body, but through our re- 
sponse to situations of stimulating character we may be 
aroused to release in any particular effort more than we 
habitually expend. Most people have little appreciation 
of the tremendous power they possess, and many people 
spend their whole life without at any time calling on those 
great energizing mechanisms which result in great achieve- 
ment. A corollary of this is that most people never live 
up to the highest level of their best, and, as a rule, fail to 
appreciate what health, happiness, and love really are. 
We can hope for a great increase in effective living when 
more people bring into their lives the powerful and stim- 
ulating forces which enable them to release and trans- 
form energy that the body possesses into the doing of a 
really important work and the living of a really effective 
life. The strongest and most powerful forces in this re- 
spect are ideals of service. If the ideal of social respon- 
sibility really belongs to one, its value will be seen in real 
achievement. 

The health of a man and his best welfare cannot be 

determined by a mechanical or materialistic test. In the 

working out of any scheme for the development of the 

best in the individual full appreciation must be given to 

1 Cannon, W. B.: Loc. cit. 



78 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

those indirect factors that profoundly influence the con- 
duct of the individual and always determine results in 
the final analysis. The human mechanism, while made 
up of organs and cells that receive their energy from the 
sun through the plants hi the same way that cells in other 
animals receive their energy, is in man nevertheless subject 
to a different kind of control. It will be important to keep 
this point in mind because the solution of many of the 
problems of living is dependent upon an understanding of 
the emotional and psychic factors involved in health, and 
the power of intelligence in maintaining health. "What 
we wish to insist on is that man's intelligence is a fact, 
that it is immensely and in effect immeasurably superior 
to the intelligence of the lower animal, and that this in- 
telligence can become the significant guiding factor in 
man's conduct." 1 The realization of the essential chemical 
character of man need never exclude an appreciation of the 
fact that this chemical character is one that is controlled 
by a nervous system that has given to us intelligence and 
ideals, both a promise of God in man. 2 

The Value of the Biologic View. When it is recalled 
that exercise, food, air, rest, sleep, and bathing form a 
very large part of the subject matter of hygiene, we realize 
the value of looking at the body from a biologic point of 
view. The story of animal life must never be forgotten. 
The primitive cell, as represented in such an animal as 
the Protozoa, is able to move, to gather and digest food, 
to take in oxygen and expel the waste, to rest and keep 
itself free from the poisons that would most readily injure 
it. This organism combines in one cell all the functions 
that man must care for in different systems of the body, 
but man is just as dependent as this cell on the effective 
workings of these functions. This fact should never be 
forgotten. Unfortunately, it frequently is forgotten hi the 
absorbing activities of the nervous system. But the

nervous system itself is dependent upon these other proc- 
esses for its very foundation and sanity, so that one can 
hardly hope to achieve any real and lasting success through 
the nervous system without caring in an intelligent way 
for the biologic basis of life. 

Let there be no misunderstanding on this point. He 
who would have health must work for it. Wishing for it 
will not achieve it; ideals without intelligent effort are 
dead. It is not something that can be bought at the 
corner drug store or achieved by mental or spiritual proc- 
esses. Health, strength, and vigor in any person is 
health, strength, and vigor of the vital organs of the body, 
including the nerve-centers of the cord, and it should be 
clear and compelling that this strength comes largely from 
the use of the muscles of the body, and especially the 
trunk muscles in youth. If we would lay the foundation 
for health, strength, and power we must run, jump, 
climb, swim, and engage in play and sports that have 
engrossed man since earliest times. One need expect no 
real results by five minutes of formal exercise in the bed- 
room on retiring or by deep breathing at an open window. 
The way to health is the path of wholesome activity. 
This implies something more than riding in street cars, 
eating prepared and predigested foods, breathing deeply 
for five minutes in twenty-four hours, and working over 
long periods without reasonable time for rest, recreation, 
and sleep. 

There need be no essential conflict between the demands 
of health and the demands of the intellectual and moral 
life. If health is not thought of as an end, but only as a 
means for the accomplishment of worthwhile work in life, 
no conflict will arise. That life which may be called 
"good" will be physically wholesome, mentally keen and 
fervid, and morally sound. 

To have health and not to use it in socially serviceable 
ways is, of course, morally wrong. The man or woman 
who refuses to use health and strength for the accom- 
plishment of service to society has no justification today.

The two extremes are recognized here: the individual who 
fosters health for health's sake, and the one who loses his 
health in the effort to achieve a piece of work. Of the two 
courses, the latter is preferable. Professor Thorndike re- 
marks in this connection: 

"To some extent we barter our health for the other 
valuables knowledge, skill, and habits of utility to the 
community. At present we probably sell too much of 
health, but it would be equally unwise to sacrifice every- 
thing for health. It is better to be a Socrates with a 
headache than a perfectly healthy pig. There must be a 
compromise." 

The art of fine living consists of the greatest intellectual 
development and the most worthy social service possible, 
without loss of power to continue the race adequately, to 
enjoy life fully, and to be a real source of happiness to others. 

The Test of Hygienic Knowledge. The test of the use- 
fulness of hygienic knowledge is to be found in its con- 
tribution to the art of fine living. A considerable amount 
of health advice and instruction has been made for in- 
dividuals and provides no guide for all. Many persons 
learn some particular practice because a friend who was 
ill was advised by the physician to do thus and so. 
Any particular health advice must be made and upheld 
because it is of value not in healing the sick, but in keeping 
the well strong and happy, in preventing illness, and 
making the individual more efficient and useful. The 
test of its value is not is it good for the sick, but is it 
rational and scientific for the well. The treatment of the 
convalescent is not the treatment of the vigorous man of 
affairs or the healthy teamster who may by hygiene be- 
come more vigorous and more strong. 

Hygienic or health knowledge must apply to the whole 
of man. It is to be criticized as a system if it is effective 
only in neurasthenic states. The use of faith cures, or 
spinal adjustments, or the practice of abstaining from the 
use of meat, or the carrying of an onion in the hair for 
relief of headache, are partial, limited, and incomplete 



THE APPROACH FOR KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH 81 

procedures. They may have special application in special 
cases. But confusion of special measures with systems 
must not be made. The few trees must never be taken 
for a forest; the few swallows, for a summer. The hy- 
gienic procedure that purports to possess universal char- 
acters must be viewed with suspicion. The life of man in 
his adjustment to the strains of modern life, in his hopes 
and aspirations, in his work, play, recreation, indeed, in 
his love and worship, is not to be guided by mystic for- 
mulae, nor to be saved by special methods. Hygiene is to 
be tested by its contribution to the whole of life.

The Dual Aspect. The problem of personal hygiene is 
a problem that involves science which provides us with 
the accurate knowledge of the way in which to care for 
the body, and habitual attitudes which use this scientific 
knowledge in the service of ideals. 

The laws of health are given by science. They come 
from the food laboratory, biology laboratory, health de- 
partments, statistical bureaus, university departments of 
hygiene, organizations such as the Public Health Associa- 
tion, Anti-Tuberculosis League, American Medical Asso- 
ciation, and State and Federal bureaus, such as the United 
States Public Health Bureau and State Departments of 
Health. These health departments and bureaus for hy- 
gienic living test out the traditional and customary modes 
of living and serve as effective and authoritative sources 
for the determination of the values of any particular 
hygienic practice. The laws of health, if they are to serve 



SCIENCE AND ATTITUDES 83 

as good guides, must be accurate and scientific, and at no 
time can they depend upon superstition and hearsay. A 
certain number of people believe that rheumatism may 
be avoided by carrying in the pocket a red kidney bean. 
Such belief is probably founded upon the single experi- 
ence of one man who carried a bean in his pocket and 
never had rheumatism. It is unnecessary to say how 
fallacious such reasoning is, and yet in more subtle and 
confusing arguments there is need to hold to the general 
tenets of scientific proof 1 of the value of any particular pro- 
cedure. One of the responsibilities of the educated person 
is to refrain from being moved by superstition. Wisdom 
expresses itself in many ways; one way is by the use of 
scientific guides as distinguished from the occult, mys- 
terious, and superstitious. "Education is the vaccination 
that confers immunity, but it does not always take." 

The laws of health are given by science; the practice of 
them is a matter of habit in which ideals and attitudes 
have shared largely. For the best results in education 
health habits should never be automatic except in the 
routine care of the body. For meeting the complex, widely 
varying problems of human adjustment, the only safe- 
guard is ideals of living that shall foster and strengthen 
desirable attitudes. The most scientific theory of correct 
living, made automatic, might succeed in an artificial 
environment, but for life in the present world it needs 
constant correction by intelligence and constant motiva- 
tion by ideals. 

Science and Health. It is contended here that the 
laws of health are given by science, and the science invoked 
here is that of the laboratory, the health departments, 
and the life of the world. In contrast to this view is the 
conception of health as held by a group that claims to 
recognize science and to base its guides upon the teachings 
of Christ. The religious character of their belief acts as a 
deterrent to criticism, but the health implications are so

pp. 112-130, C. V. Mosby Co., St. Louis, 1920. 



84 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

prominent that the position of the Christian Scientist 
should be examined. 

The Position of the Christian Scientist. The Christian 
Scientist negates all science of health as we know science 
in physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology, and puts 
in its place a claim, an insistence that there is no such 
thing as body and, consequently, no such thing as disease. 
The realities of bacteria, the toxicity of toxins, the de- 
struction of poisons have no place in his thought because 
for him they are non-existent. He ignores them. His 
attitude is similar to that of the ostrich in hiding from 
sight by poking its head in the sand. How can people 
who have made no study of the sciences of pathology, 
bacteriology, and the history of disease form intelligent 
opinions regarding the cause, the symptoms, the diag- 
nosis, and treatment of disease! Their "science" consists 
in denying the existence of disease through a type of 
glorified suggestion, and, having no capacity for scientific 
study of cases or real investigations of causes and treat- 
ments, they are totally unable to speak with any authority 
regarding disease. 

Their followers and enthusiasts are, in the main, those 
who have been "cured" of imaginary afflictions. They 
present no body of thought that is helpful in stating either 
the science or the ideals that should help science in serving 
manhood and womanhood. Moreover, in the neurotic 
cases, where results are secured, the individual is in- 
fluenced by a hocus pocus instead of being guided by 
the psychologic truths that would rationalize life for 
him. 

In noting that Christian Science cures certain cases 
students of hygiene frequently ask, "If Christian Science 
gets results hi some cases, why is it not a good thing for 
society?" Aside from other reasons for its disapproval, it 
should be noted that any system, scheme, or program that 
relies upon hocus pocus, upon fancy rather than fact, 
upon crude credence rather than truth, should not appeal 
to one interested in living intelligently. The curing of 



SCIENCE AND ATTITUDES 85 

neurasthenics by mysticism is not increasing the in- 
telligent processes of the human race. 

The position of the Christian Scientist is, therefore, one 
of irrationality, a position not supported by science, and 
totally unacceptable for purposes of an intelligent life. 

The Christian Scientist Not Prepared to Judge. The 
devotees of Christian Science, as of other well-wishing 
systems, are not prepared to judge of health or disease, 
primarily because they know so little about them. Start- 
ing from assumptions contrary to fact, they reach fanciful 
conclusions in the health field in precisely the same way 
that they arrive at convictions in other fields. In a 
masterly discussion of values in human life Royce 1 in his 
chapter on optimism, pessimism, and the moral order 
examines the philosophy of this group. As a moral and 
religious teacher Professor Royce is interested in studying 
Christian Science and other pseudo-optimistic doctrines 
with reference to their spiritual implications. He says many 
things that help to explain the mental twist of these people : 

"Extremely characteristic of the mood of such religious optimism 
is in many minds a dread of the natural order as science knows it. 
Your optimist of this type, if he devotes himself to political theoriz- 
ing, has a peculiarly violent dislike for economic facts. To his mind 
there are no evils in society except competition and poverty, which 
will both cease as soon as we by chance fall to loving one another 
and to owning the property of the nation hi common. Crime is not 
a result of anything deep in human nature; selfishness is a mere in- 
cident of a defective social system. With fewer hours of labor we 
should have many times the spirituality we now have. Sin is not 
only mere ignorance; it is something still more limited; it is mere 
ignorance of the proper theory of the functions of government. . . . 
Evil being an illusion, the spiritual powers being in complete owner- 
ship of the entire world, there is no reason why any day the scene 
of our sorrow should not be entirely transformed. In the hope of 
such transformation the faithful wait and trust. Meanwhile they 
expect little help from mere science, which once for all deals with 
the world of mind and of sense in a lower sphere." 

Professor Royce goes on to make plain that such doctrine 
is not truly spiritual at all, nor does it represent a genuine 
idealism.

Co., Boston, 1892, p. 446.

In a remarkable book Jastrow 1 has sensed this peculiar 
position of the Christian Scientist and indicts the public 
for enormous credulity. He says in part: 

"To complete the collection of types of credulity, we should 
have an instance in which a system of. interpretation of facts not 
a mere narrative in itself startling and contradictory to ordinary 
experience, gams wide-spread credence, and that in spite of pro- 
nounced inconsistency with verifiable observation and common 
sense. These conditions are remarkably well satisfied by the recent 
promulgation of the doctrines of Christian Science. Even in this 
field of intellectual effort the land of the free and the home of the 
brave has contributed an article worthy to compete with the foreign 
product. Eagle-like this system spreads its wings and soars free 
from the bonds of sense or earth-bound realities, free from human 
logic and the errors of mortal mind, free from the material impedi- 
ments which nature has inconsiderately set in our paths, free to 
make things so by thinking them so, free to set method, learning, 
and experience at naught. And surely it calls for courage of no 
common order to resist the seductive appeals of eye and ear, to sail 
steadily on heedless of the calls of sirens of rationality, convinced 
at the outset that things cannot be as they are, and refusing the nod 
of recognition to the plebian idols of the ills of flesh. It is not 
necessary in this connection to recount the beliefs of this system; 
it is sufficient to point out that when thousands of intelligent persons 
give practical adherence to, and enroll themselves under the banner 
of one who teaches that a bunion would be an adequate cause of 
insanity, if only we held the same belief about the bunion as we do 
about congestion of the brain; that smallpox is contagious by reason 
of the same agencies as make weeping or yawning contagious; that 
fear may be reflected in the body as fractured bones, just as shame 
is seen rising to the cheek; that anatomy and physiology and hygiene 
are the husbandmen of sickness and disease, while the reading of a 
text-book of Christian Science is equally effective in producing 
health; that when a healthy horse takes cold without his blanket it 
is on account of the poor creature's knowledge of physiology then 
such persons can hardly complain if they are cited as instances of 
modern credulity." 

The Christian Scientist Ignores Facts. The history or 
course of a disease is known by the records of its occur- 
rence, its morbidity rate, its mortality, and its complica- 
tions. The influence of any new method of treatment may 
be determined by statistical study of the death-rate. The 
death-rate is subject to the same kind of scientific testing 
as the birth-rate, immigration, or any other process in

Co., Boston, 1918.

which the facts are gathered. The use of antitoxin for the 
treatment of diphtheria has been one of the triumphs of 
scientific medicine. It is the peculiar mind of the Christian 
Scientist that can ignore the following table 1 giving the 
number of deaths per 10,000 of population before and 
after the use of antitoxin:

In the above cities the effect of the antitoxin treatment 
upon municipal mortality figures has been directly pro- 
portionate to the extent to which the health departments 
have believed in its efficacy and encouraged its use by 
furnishing it free to the poor and sending their own in- 
spectors to administer it. From 1896 to 1899 the rate in 
Philadelphia was not greatly affected, due to an opposition 
to its use on the part of the health authorities. After its 
use was extended the rate fell, and in the years from 1900 
to 1919 Philadelphia compares favorably with the other 
cities in the list. 

What is true for diphtheria and antitoxin is more

1912. It should be noted that the large number of men 
voluntarily submitting to inoculation accounts for the low 
rate in 1910 and 1911, immediately before it became com- 
pulsory. 

Havard, 1 in commenting on the value of inoculation 
against typhoid, says: 

"During the four years 1909-1912 no deaths occurred among vac- 
cinated soldiers in the United States." 

Woodhull, 2 in commenting on typhoid in the Civil and 
Spanish-American wars, says: 

"According to statistics used by Major F. F. Russell (Military 
Surgeon June, 1909) the Federal army alone had more than 80,000 
cases of typhoid fever in the war for the Union. During five months 
in the Spanish War (Official Board on Typhoid Fever) we had 
20,738 cases and 1580 deaths among 107,973 officers and men in 
camps within the United States, or 19.26 per cent, sufferers from the 



The American Army in the World War had compulsory 
inoculation. Making allowances for failures in technic or 
in organization, it is to be noted that from September 1, 
1917 to May 2, 1919 there were 213 deaths from typhoid 
in an army with a mean strength for that period of 
2,121,958 

Additional evidence is available in comparison of the 
camp at Jacksonville in 1898 (Spanish-American War) and 
the camp at San Antonio in 1912 (mobilization on the 
Texas Border). 

At Jacksonville before typhoid inoculation there were 
10,759 soldiers, 2000 cases, 248 deaths; at San Antonio, 
with compulsory vaccination, there were 12,801 soldiers, 
2 cases, no deaths. It is an interesting and instructive 
fact that in the Spanish-American War 243 soldiers died 
of wounds and 1580 perished of typhoid fever (Fig. 2). 

In the light of such evidence it is, indeed, surprising 
how apparently intelligent persons will oppose and carry

The Danger from Christian Science. The teaching and 
practice of Christian Science is dangerous to society be- 
cause it ignores the transmissibility of disease, and hence 
subjects the community to cases that should be isolated. 

All the work in the public health field today emphasizes 
the danger to others that comes from contact with mild 
cases. We have only recently appreciated the significance 
of " walking typhoid" as presenting a condition in which the

individual had the disease in such mild form that he was 
not aware of the infection and yet was capable of infecting 
others. Many of the communicable diseases have mild 
forms, and so when they fall into the hands of certain 
quacks and irregular systems of healing marvelous cures 
are reported by invoking a divining rod or ruling out error 
or other ridiculous methods. Not infrequently individuals 
recover from infections without medical attention. The 
explanation of this fact is so well given by Chapin 1 that 
his own words are quoted: 

"The scientific physician does not pretend to cure maladies by 
drugs and medicines. Nature performs the cure. All diseases are 
self-limited and end in complete or partial recovery or in death. 
By understanding the natural history of disease, however, the 
physician aids nature at a critical point in her struggles. This 
may be accomplished in many ways. He may assist in the elimina- 
tion of rapidly collecting poisons, or in sustaining a failing heart or 
relieving a congested lung. By many similar actions the physician 
daily saves lives that would otherwise be lost. Needless death 
and disability are frequently avoided by the art of the scientific 
physician. It is in imaginary, functional, or quickly limited dis- 
eases that the patient may get along well without any special treat- 
ment. Unfortunately, the mental healer does not always attend 
this kind. Imaginary cancers disappear, but the real ones .persist, 
with the hopeful tune of early removal irrevocably gone. Incipient 
tuberculosis and many other diseases, in the early and curable 
stage, are allowed to become chronic and hopeless. The real dis- 
eases eventually get into the hands of the physician, but often too 
late to save health or life. Here is where the tragedy comes in." 

It is important to understand the danger to the health 
of the nation that lies in the propaganda of the Christian 
Scientist. The danger is real and insidious because it 
operates under the guise of religion, on the one hand, and 
a healing cult on the other. It reaches not only those who 
have imaginary disease but also those who are sufferers 
from serious organic disturbance. Christian Scientist 
practioners are not capable of diagnosing or treating 
disease because of their lack of training and their false 
assumptions. In this connection Chapin 2 says:

1917, p. 217.

"How can people, who confessedly have not made a scientific 
study of the pathology and natural history of disease, give reliable 
reports as to the results of any or no treatment? Many of them 
deny the real existence of the very disease they pretend to cope 
with so successfully. Every thinking person must realize that 
reports and statistics of ordinary or miraculous cures from such a 
source cannot stand real investigation. Yet such statements some- 
times influence people who are accustomed to verify claims when 
positively made. When these assertions are coupled with general- 
ities that sound elevated and pious, the unthinking may be 
impressed. 

"Even scarlet fever may be treated by high thought and lofty 
utterances. Those who have scientifically studied this malady are 
constantly looking for its insidious, severe, and permanent complica- 
tions. Some cases, however, as we all know, are mild in type and 
need no special medical treatment except careful watching for com- 
plications and an avoidance of the spread of infection to others. 
The only way to detect these complications is by careful examina- 
tions of the vital organs liable to be affected by the poisons of the 
disease. The various healers are not competent to do this; there- 
fore the eventual results are unknown. . . . How many cases 
of infectious disease . . . "passed on" or are now passing through 
life with crippling and avoidable complications, no one will ever 
know. Neither will it ever come to light how many cases of scarlet 
fever and similar dangerous infections have been spread to others 
by this sort of treatment. Here lies the most serious social aspect 
of this question to the community." 

Social Responsibility and Christian Science. Typical of 
the operation of Christian Science in such a serious disease 
as diphtheria is the case of a child in New Jersey who re- 
ceived only "absent" treatment. An editorial in the 
Journal of the American Medical Association reviews this 
case with reference to the question involved. 1 It is worth 
reading in this connection: 

"A New Jersey salesman, who claims to have been a member of 
the 'Christian Science' faith for three years, was recently found 
guilty of manslaughter because he had permitted his nine-year-old 
daughter, who was suffering from diphtheria, to die without medical 
treatment. The little girl was given 'treatment' 'absent' and 
otherwise by a professional 'Christian Science' practitioner. The 
man was fined $1000 and costs. The judge, in imposing sentence, 
is reported to have said: 

" 'In the light of present-day science, which is the result of many 

years of progressive experiment and demonstration, no one is justified 

in neglecting the use of such agencies as have been shown to be efficient 

in the treatment of malignant and contagious diseases, and this is

especially true where one is charged with responsibility over the life of 
another, and particularly of a child of tender years, who has no option 
but to rely on the common sense and good judgment of its natural 
protector.' l 

"The verdict has brought to light, as such verdicts are likely to 
do, the loose thinking that characterizes so many of the so-called 
intellectuals of today. Well-meaning people, who deny that they 
are followers of Mrs. Eddy, have written to the newspapers de- 
nouncing the verdict and declaring that it is little less than a crime 
that a man should be punished for following the dictates of his 
conscience. The main point stressed by such people seems to be 
that as children occasionally die of diphtheria under medical 
treatment, there is no reason for getting excited when a child dies 
under 'Christian Science' treatment. The argument, of course, is 
fallacious. The efficacy of the modern scientific medical treat- 
ment of diphtheria is not a matter of theory, belief, or conscience 
it is a matter of fact. Its efficacy is as demonstrable as is the 
efficacy of the Westinghouse air-brake. The parent or guardian who 
fails to give his child or ward the benefit of modern medical treat- 
ment for diphtheria becomes as culpable as a railroad would be if 
it failed to equip its passenger trains with air-brakes. Sometimes, 
it is true, the air-brake fails to avert a fatality; but that is not the 
fault of the brake, nor is it any argument for its abolition. 

"If an adult in his own right mind wishes to be treated by 
'Christian Science' or any other unscientific methods, there can 
be no objection, provided the disease from which he is suffering 
may not, through such treatment, become a menace to the com- 
munity. Children of tender years, however, should not be sacri- 
ficed to the distorted views of those who are supposed to be their 
protectors. 

"Religious beliefs should be respected, and, in general, they are 
respected. Where, however, religious beliefs conflict with the gen- 
eral welfare, such beliefs must give way. Presumably, the Mormons 
were sincere in their belief in polygamy; that particular tenet of 
their religion, however, had to give way to the more enlightened 
belief of the rest of the community. The Dukhobors that migrated 
to Canada were undoubtedly sincere in their belief that they should 
go nude, and the practice of this belief was undoubtedly less a 
menace to the community than are some of the bizarre views held 
by 'Christian Scientists' regarding the cause and treatment of 
disease. Nevertheless, the Dukhobors had to put on clothes. It 
is conceivable that we might have transplanted to this country 
some of the religious beliefs of India, but it is doubtful whether 
public opinion in the United States would ever look with equa- 
nimity on Sutteeism, even though the widows might declare that 
being burned on the funeral pyres of their deceased husbands was 
a matter of their own personal belief and was none of the concern 
of the general public. Only a few weeks ago a man in Chicago 
shot his son with the avowed intention of killing the boy because 
he feared the lad was acquiring bad habits and he wished to save 
the boy's soul. We have not yet noticed any letters of indigna-

tion protesting against the man's arrest. Possibly this is because 
he represents a minority. Should such beliefs ever reach the dig- 
nity of a religious cult with money and well-organized publicity 
machinery behind it, there would doubtless be found many to 
defend the killing of minors for the purpose of 'saving' them." 

The Kind of Disease that Christian Science Cures. The 
cures of Christian Science are the cures of imaginary 
diseases that develop readily in people with unstable 
nervous systems. The psychiatrist, the nerve specialist, 
and often the "family doctor" succeed with the same 
types. 

In the course of routine and daily work physicians and 
surgeons of the medical profession are performing wonder- 
ful cures, operations, and diagnoses. 

"An interesting though not unique case is described in 
a recent bulletin sent out by the Federal Board for Vo- 
cational Education. Among the blinded ex-service men 
was a negro who seemed to be blind in both eyes. Neither 
eye could perceive five fingers at any distance. He had 
faint light perception and there was hope of sight restora- 
tion in one eye. The man was about to be assigned to a 
workshop for the blind when a physician managed to 
persuade him that he was not blind. The report of the 
case reads: He was suffering from psychoneurosis hys- 
teria giving rise to marked blepharospasm 1 and photo- 
phobia 2 and amaurosis. 3 All physical findings negative. 
Treatments by suggestion completely cleared up all 
symptoms and I discharged this man cured. 

"This case is not referred to because it is unique in 
medicine, for, as physicians know, it is not. Had the man 
regained his sight, however, while under 'Christian 
Science' treatment or while having his vertebrae pushed 
by a chiropractor, what a to-do would have been made of 
it. The case would have become a classic in the annals of

the cult. As it is, the incident would never have reached 
the public eye had it not been for the bulletin of the 
vocational educational board." l 

A Recent Arrival. The violation of fundamental hy- 
gienic rules of living causes a variety of disturbances in 
health, so that many people are continually below par. 
They think badly, they feel badly, and then they act 
badly. Such persons, when uninformed, offer a splendid 
field for the charlatan and the fraud. 

One of the recent cults, claiming to treat disturbed 
bodily states as well as disease itself, is known as chiro- 
practic. Its exponents are called chiropractors. 

What is Chiropractic? Just what chiropractic is re- 
mains a mystery. It is a method of spinal manipulation, 
but aside from that it is unknown in science. Pamphlets 
of the chiropractors contain statements concerning bodily 
physiology that are unproved, speculative, and, to say 
the least novel. 

Recently an interesting attempt to define chiropractic 
appeared in a bill presented to the New Jersey Legislature, 
in an Act to Regulate the Practice of Chiropractic. The 
opening paragraph of the act follows: 

"Definition of Chiropractic: The term chiropractic when used in 
this act shall be construed to mean and be the name given to the 
study and application of a universal philosophy of biology, theology, 
theosophy, health, disease, death, the science of the cause of dis- 
ease and art of permitting the restoration of the triune relation- 
ships between all attributes necessary to normal composite forms, 
to harmonious quantities and qualities by placing in juxtaposition 
the abnormal concrete positions of definite mechanical portions 
with each other by hand, thus correcting all subluxations of the 
articulations of the spinal column, for the purpose of permitting 
the recreation of all normal cyclic currents through nerves that 
were formerly not permitted to be transmitted, through impinge- 
ment, but have now assumed their normal size and capacity for 
conduction as they emanate through intervertebral foramina the 
expressions of which were formerly lacking named disease." 

Surely the author of the act would have no difficulty in 
explaining the Einstein theory of relativity.

Chiropractic will remain a debatable subject, even to 
chiropractors, until scientific standards and tests are 
applied to it. It may grow by advertising methods, it 
may record "cures" by adjustment of subluxations, but it 
will remain a claim and a cult until it meets satisfactorily 
the sort of tests that intelligent men everywhere make to 
cause and effect questions. 1 

When chiropractic can prove that all disease is due to 
"subluxations of the spinal column," then failure in any 
one case will not be condemned. However, the report of 
the New York Times (December 12, 1921, p. 6) of the 
death of David Lebish after two days' treatment by a 
chiropractor should give concern. Especially since the 
autopsy showed that the boy died of a ruptured appendix 
following the "adjustments" of the chiropractor. 

The character of a chiropractor's training, the extent of 
education, and even an index of intelligence are given by 
the following statement published (at advertising rates) 
by a chiropractor of Waukesha, Wisconsin. In giving the 
pathology of gall-stones and kidney stones he says: 

"Gall-stones are due to an excessive amount of heat in the gall- 
bladder which crystallizes the calcareous material in the bile and 
forms stones. This excessive heat results from the loss of calorific 
or heat control of nerves due to nerve pressure in the middle dorsal 
vertebral region. Adjustment of the causative subluxation restores 
the condition to normal. Renal stones are caused in the kidneys 
in the same manner." 

Now, unfortunately, the public is so ill-informed on 
anatomy and physiology that it cannot always judge in- 
telligently. But any layman might well ask, "How would 
an 'adjustment' remove stones already formed? If ex- 
cessive heat causes the stones, would removal of pressure 
on heat nerves destroy the stones by freezing them?" To 
get laymen to ask thoughtful questions on matters of 
personal and public health is very important for the wel- 
fare of man. Intelligent questions in this field are not

impossible if sufficient time and attention are given to 
instruction in the schools in physiology and in hygiene. 

What is Osteopathy? Osteopathy is defined 1 as "A 
system of treatment based on the theory that diseases are 
chiefly due to deranged mechanism of the bones, nerves, 
blood-vessels, and other tissues, and can be remedied by 
manipulation of these parts." Osteopathy 2 emphasizes 
the tendency of the human body "to remain in a state of 
health" and claims that the "fundamental predisposing 
cause of disease" is disturbance of normal nutritive proc- 
esses. It further claims that "a prominent cause of dis- 
turbed nutrition is anatomic malposition of the various 
parts of the body," and, moreover, that such malpositions 
"are frequently capable of correction by manual pro- 
cedures." "Osteopathic thinkers protest against the 
hasty adoption of surgical measures" in surgery, which is 
considered "a branch of osteopathy." 

It would seem that osteopathy could advance its 
position in the professional and scientific world if it 
could present a series of clinical cases of malaria (diag- 
nosed by demonstration of the Plasmodium malariae in 
the blood), of syphilis (diagnosed by the Wassermann 
test made in an accepted laboratory), and of diphtheria 
(diagnosed by demonstration of Klebs-Loffler bacilli) 
cured by manipulations. It should be noted that osteop- 
athy in its insistence on anatomic malposition as a cause 
of disease presents a limited truth. A misplaced uterus, 
kidney or stomach, a spinal curvature or postural de- 
formity may lead to disturbed nutrition, pain, and fre- 
quently to disturbance of function. But these facts and 
conditions are recognized by the scientific physician. The 
extensive development of physiotherapy in hospitals and 
private practice is based upon this recognition of physical 
causes in disease and physical means of treatment. Such 
recognition should not blind one to the protean forms in 

1 Webster's New International Dictionary.

Surgeons (Los Angeles, California, 1921). 



SCIENCE AND ATTITUDES 99 

which disease appears. Truth and fact should be accepted 
whether they fit the theory or not. Tubercular meningitis 
may disrupt osteopathic theory, but it is a fact of life. 

The tirade against overzealousness in surgical practice 
cannot justify osteopathy as a means of treatment of 
disease. To operate too soon or too often is quite as bad 
as to operate too late or too infrequently. Surgical judg- 
ment is a human quality; it does not belong to any school 
of healing. 

Osteopathy is to be judged, even as chiropractic, 
Christian Science, or medicine, by the provisions made for 
training of its students, by the scholastic standards main- 
tained, by the scientific character of its work, and finally, 
by the ethical standards of the profession. 

Life to most persons is too precious to be lost needlessly. 
The osteopath treating with manipulations an ignorant 
person suffering from diphtheria when antitoxin is avail- 
able, or "ad justing" for syphilis when arsphenamin is 
known, assumes a responsibility that cannot easily be 
discharged. 

The question every patient should ask is: Does my 
physician use every known and scientific means available 
to diagnose my condition and treat myself? Or is his 
mind shackled by an unproved theory, an untenable 
hypothesis? The sufferer from headache as well as the 
sufferer from cancer should wish to have such questions 
answered satisfactorily. 

The Call of the Occult. It is difficult to educate people 
to ask such questions. Men in all stages of development 
have been believers in spirits, and from time to time have 
brought forward evidence to support their belief. The 
witch riding a broom and the modern "Patience Worth" 
all spring from the same source and are equally irrational. 
Tap the stream of life where you will, the same kind of 
belief in the mystical that leads men to expect cancer 
cures from healing mental rays will spring forth. Probably 
no phase of this belief in spirit-agency is more persistent 
than the medical. Health for such persons is the summum

bonum, and they will reject scientific evidence and pro- 
cedure acceptable in other fields and in other problems, 
to partake of Eddyism, New Thought, a magic regulator, 
mysterious patent medicines, and other palpable frauds. 
"One could write a history of the human mind in terms of 
the cures that people underwent and the reasons offered 
for the cults. One could start with humors and tempera- 
ments, and wind through exorcism, laying on of hands, 
mesmerism, clairvoyance, and Christian Science, and with 
any number of side excursions to delay one's progress. 
Spiritualist healers who in a trance state prescribe harm- 
less drugs at hurtful prices are by no means obsolete." 

Believers in the occult and mysterious are often sincere, 
but their sincerity is no cloak that will hide the classifica- 
tion into which they must come. They represent clinical 
types that are well marked and fairly differentiated. The 
scientific man from his point of vantage "sees the en- 
semble of a forest in what to the wanderers in the jungle 
of human nature is only a tangle of trees." That in- 
dividuals of scientific training, work, and accomplish- 
ments at times get lost is no reflection on their back- 
ground the immediacy of a great sorrow, which one is 
unprepared to meet, may produce a mirage of the mys- 
terious and occult. 

For the ignorant person formulae with mystical signs 
and procedures will always be helpful in banishing fear 
and in controlling subconscious forces. But any intelligent 
plan for life looks to a scheme of things in which Socrates' 
advice, "Know thyself," is a guide to go by. The quarrel 
with the mystical, mysterious, and occult is precisely this: 
it dethrones reason and intelligence and seeks a solution 
by hocus pocus. The intelligent man or woman planning 
for life cannot be satisfied to trust his or her "all" to any- 
thing that smacks of charms or laying on of hands. The 
occult calls to the weak and foolish; for the strong, science 
will ever be the guide. Its truths, no matter how painful, 
how difficult to bear, requiring adjustments, no matter 
how long deferred) will have meaning for these.

Scientific and Humanistic Principles Confused. The 
faith that men have in programs, procedures, and results 
in some fields may be rational, but in other fields with 
similar controls, it becomes topsy-turvy and rejects the 
bases that should compel action. There are recognizable 
these variations from rational belief in the actions of a 
considerable number of antivivisectionists, antivaccina- 
tionists, conscientious objectors, and others who oppose 
any program by society in which they must co-operate. 
A keen analysis of such attitudes would diagnose the 
condition as one of a psychosis. 

These individuals are as, careless of truth and scientific 
accuracy as they are of the falsity of their position. 
Throughout the war the "anti" press printed dispatches 
charging that our army surgeons, in order that the manu- 
facturers of serums might grow rich, were, murdering our 
soldiers by wholesale under pretense of giving them pro- 
tection from typhoid. 

In April, 1918 a circular issued by the National Anti- 
vivisectionist Federation asserted that inoculation of 
American soldiers was causing thousands of deaths in the 
army cantonments. The circular, as reported by the 
New York Times, 1 contained the following statement: 

''Thousands of deaths deliberately inflicted upon our 
soldiers and sailors have passed the scandal line. It has 
become a tragedy." 2 

A reporter from the New York Times interviewed Mrs. 
David Belais, vice-president of the National Antivivisec- 
tionist Federation, and the following is reported in the 
New York Times 3 : 

"She said last night that Mrs. Henderson, who signed the cir- 
cular declaring that 'thousands of deaths deliberately inflicted upon 
our soldiers and sailors have passed the scandal line/ lived at Way- 
land, Massachusetts, and that the circular was sent out with the 
approval of the officers of the society, although they took no official 
action upon it.

this circular out of print (March, 1922).

102 PEKSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

"Mrs. Belais was most reluctant to answer when asked repeatedly 
whether she or the organization had any evidence whatsoever that 
'thousands/ hundreds, or tens had died as the result of inoculation. 
She finally said that she had received letters telling of men in the 
service who had been made Very ill' through inoculation, but 
admitted that she had no evidence of any sort that any consider- 
able number of them had died. Pressed to tell if she had evidence 
that even one had died, Mrs. Belais said that the letters were con- 
fidential and that she could not disclose their contents. 

"She deplored the use of the word 'deliberately' in the circular, 
saying: 'Of course the society doesn't believe they kill them on 
purpose. It is an abstract belief with me,' Mrs. Belais added, 
'that the practice is dangerous and unjustifiable.' 

"Asked about the alarm the society's statement might cause among 
families of soldiers, she said: 

" 'I hope it does create great alarm, because I think there should 
be a great cry against forcing people to submit their bodies to such 
treatment.' " 

The achievements of scientific medicine have ever been 
humane. The decrease in the death-rate from typhoid, 
diphtheria, and smallpox has meant the saving of human 
life. Science seeks knowledge of the truth for the service 
of mankind. 

The antivivisection efforts during the war were par- 
ticularly typical of the mixed values that guide these de- 
luded humanitarians. Their suit to prevent the Red 
Cross from using funds for animal experimentation was 
characteristic of their appreciation of relative values. 
Jastrow, 1 in speaking of this incident, says: 

"To state that vivisection has brought no benefit to mankind, 
in face of the overpowering evidence to the contrary, shows the utter 
blindness to evidence of a convinced sentimental prejudice; to urge 
that prejudice at this time and thus to cripple the humanitarian 
efforts that redeem the awful calamaties of war shows the complete 
disregard of humane considerations to which unreason may lead. 
In the face of this instance of bigoted opinion, the strictures above 
applied to it seem criminally lenient. Like the delusions of the 
insane to which such fanaticism is allied the distinction between 
innocent and dangerous beliefs is most treacherous. Society cannot 
afford an attitude of tolerance; the menace of extreme conviction is 
too serious."

The value of antitoxin in diphtheria and the efficacy of 
typhoid inoculation have been stated. The determination 
of truth does not, unfortunately, lead automatically to 
the rejection of superstition by all people. 

The history of smallpox ought to have meaning and does 
show significance to the intelligent mind. Before smallpox 
vaccination was discovered the epidemics of smallpox that 
swept Europe were more devastating to life than the in- 
fluenza epidemic of 1918 and 1919 in the United States. 
It is important to note in this connection the value of 
vaccination as shown by countries having compulsory 
vaccination and those not having it (Fig. 3). 

In contradistinction to the available records of scientific 
medicine are the wild newspaper propaganda of that 
noisy group calling themselves antivivisectionists, anti- 
vaccinationists, and naturopath "physicians." In spite of 
fact, in defiance of truth, there exist emotional and irra- 
tional exponents of fanciful theories of disease and health. 
Superstition, custom, belief these are the fetishes they 
worship. On questions of health they belong mentally 
with the group of natives in South India, described by Dr. 
Manley, 1 as they were attempting to drive the "Demon 
Smallpox" from the village of Ongole: 

"The tom-toms beat all night and this morning the streets are 
fairly covered with chicken feathers. For black smallpox has taken 
the city and must be driven out. The priests have told the people 
to kill chickens and strew their feathers in the streets so they will 
catch the eye of Polerimah, the plague demon, and distract her 
attention. The tom-toms throbbing in the air will either frighten 
her or please her so much that she will forget to jump) down the 
throats of any careless mortals whom she might find with mouths 
opened in speaking, or with lips parted, or sleeping with uncovered 
faces. Yes! the goddess Polerimah is angry with the people. 

"In the very heart of the bazar, our native servants told us, we 
should find Polerimah in all her glory. . . . But instead I saw only 
a squat little figure, no more than a foot tall, made of black mud 
and covered with tinsel. She was soaked with lemon-colored water 
which dripped off her shoulders into a widely spreading puddle 
round her feet. 

"'Why so much wetness?' I asked with an amused smile.

Medical Association.

"'They must keep her cool,' answered our guide with great dig- 
nity. 'If she gets warm she gets mad. So they have built this 
temple of reeds to protect her from the sun, and every few minutes 
the priests pour saffron tinted water over her. Whatever happens 
she must be kept cool.' 



" 'Now what will they do? ' we asked. 

" 'They are arranging to escort the goddess out of town/ said our 
guide. 'They have done everything they could to appease her anger 
and make her happy; and now they are going to carry her out of 
town while she is in a happy frame of mind, and throw her in the 
ocean.' 

"The procession was formed. First came the priest carrying on 
his head a basket in which were the bull's entrails, crowned by his 
head, holding in his hideous grinning mouth the bone of his front 
foreleg. Behind him came the goddess, carried on the head of an- 
other priest. And as the throng proceeded down the street, people 
by the wayside wrung the necks of chickens and threw the headless 
bloody bodies over the people's heads toward the image. The horns 
blew, the tom-toms throbbed, and the people yelled themselves 
hoarse, waving their reeds in the air. What is the priest screaming? 

" 'Yell, brother, yell! Let confusion reign! Let not the terrible 
Polerimah suspect our fell designs, and fall upon us before we are 
safely rid of her!' 

"Following in the wake of the procession I came up to a young 
mother who was hurrying along dragging a tiny child by the hand. 
The little girl was staggering, her bare body was a mass of scars, 
her eyes heavy and dull with the intoxication of the dread disease. 
The child's mother cried out to Polerimah to have mercy. As her 
wails mingled with the shrieks of thousands the procession passed 
down the crooked, dusty road and out of sight. 

"Tonight, out there in the dark somewhere, many young mothers 
are sitting in black despair, because in spite of all their sacrifices to 
the demon, the lives of their babies stricken with the fearful plague 
are surely ebbing away." 

Patent Medicines and Fear. Of the many ignoble 
characteristics of the "patent medicine' ' business none is 
more despicable than its appeal to fear. The business 
thrives on fear and seeks by its advertising to create fear. 
An epidemic of disease is the occasion for new nostrums 
to appear claiming to prevent or cure the disease in ques- 
tion, and for old ones to set up new claims in harmony 
with the needs of the moment. The exploitation of the 
New Orleans public at the time of the yellow fever epi- 
demic, the pamphleteering of the New York public at the 
time of the meningitis epidemic, the blatant advertising

unwarranted claims made for sprays and gargles during 
the epidemic of infantile paralysis bear witness to this 
appeal to fear. But epidemics are not necessary for their

of many of the most widely advertised quacks. Accurate

nostrum on the market in the two splendid volumes of 
Nostrums and Quackery, published by the American 
Medical Association, 535 N. Dearborn Street, Chicago, 
Illinois. 

The Challenge of Scientific Medicine. Scientific medi- 
cine is based upon the study of the normal structure and 
function of the human body and the variations of that 
normal, called disease. In disease the cause, course, com- 
plications, and outcome of diseased processes together 
with the results of treatment must be determined. There 
is no acceptance in modern medical practice of speculation 
for accurate observation; that as a procedure was dis- 
carded over a century ago. Careful observation of 
phenomena, exact interpretation and measurement of 
signs, complete history of the course of disease, are the 
fundamentals of medical practice. Every year diseases 
are yielding to the painstaking efforts of practitioners, 
research workers, and experts. Many problems have 
been solved; many remain to be solved. There are still 
diseases that cannot with absolute correctness be diag- 
nosed. Scientific medicine is frank, free from taint of 
hypocrisy, fraud, and charlatanism. 

The great advance in medical science, outside the field 
of surgery, has been the use of the biologic sciences upon 
which must always rest the tests in diagnosis and the 
rationale of therapy. Why presumably rational people 
will permit a chiropractor to treat for a condition undiag- 
nosed, or a Christian Scientist to give treatments while 
ignoring the pictures the #-ray will show, are to be ex- 
plained in terms of Goddard's "levels of intelligence." 
The intelligent man cannot choose the superstitious when 
the scientific is available. 

Examples of the Methods of Scientific Medicine. As an 
illustration of the procedure available in diagnostic clinics, 
accessible to most physicians, in hospitals and free clinics,

pathology of tissue, type differentiation of the pneu- 
mococcus, and milk examination (human). 

These examinations, I to X inclusive, are essentially 
laboratory tests. In addition, the use that scientific 
medicine makes of personal and family history, inspection, 



110 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

palpation, percussion, ausculation, and mensuration in the 
physical examination, is very great. With the aid given 
by laboratory findings the personal observation of the 
physician himself is corrected or verified. 

The presence or absence of disease can only be deter- 
mined by scientific methods. It is not possible that a 
clairvoyant, mind-reader, or Christian Scientist can tell 
whether or not the human body is diseased any more 
successfully than a blacksmith can determine whether or 
not a Swiss watch is in need of attention. Both groups 
are able to detect whether or not the organism is per- 
forming its function, but neither the Christian Scientist 
nor the blacksmith, the chiropractor, nor the wheelwright 
can determine what is the cause of the disturbance or the 
proper method to pursue to correct the condition. In 
these particular cases the only rational procedure is to 
secure the services of a properly experienced watchmaker 
in the case of the watch, and a properly experienced 
physician in the case of the human body. 

That procedure is rational which bases its principles of 
action upon the demonstrated facts of living processes. 
Instruments of precision, such as the microscope, the 
x-ray, the chemical laboratory, and the technic of the 
scientific method, bring to the study of man, both in 
health and in disease, a record that can be proved by 
others working with like care and precision. 

Man, the Organism. It is important to remember 
that to some the doctrine of the Christian Scientist repre- 
sents the reaction against the materialism in so much of 
our life today. Physicians as well as laymen need to re- 
member that man is a unit of mind and body, and that it is 
fallacious to think of him in his reactions and expressions 
as purely physical or purely mental. Moreover, the 
factors that enter into the production of health must be 
completely evaluated. The psychical must be considered 
as well as the physical. This does not mean that one is to 
treat typhoid by mental rays and spiritual light, but it 
does mean that in the whole life of man he who would 



SCIENCE AND ATTITUDES 111 

attain health, and he who would restore health, must 
know the forces that affect personality in its spiritual as- 
pirations and be able to recognize the demands of the 
mind and soul as well as those of the stomach and the 
intestines. There is an element of truth in most of the 
systems that attempt either to teach health or restore 
health, but the mistake of the credulous lies in accepting 
as a guidance for the whole of life a lantern, when an arc 
light is available. It should be remembered, therefore, 
that science cannot neglect the mind of the individual in 
dealing with the body (the physician must treat the 
patient and not the disease) ; the mental healers in ridicu- 
lous fashion neglect the body and its nature. 

This influence of the mind over the body is one of the 
most admirable relations, and yet in the hands of char- 
latans, pseudoscientists, and others this fact is used with 
pernicious results. It is known that persons suffering 
from hopeless maladies are especially susceptible to the 
suggestion that comes from any new treatment with 
glowing promises. This psychic element in cancer, for 
example, has been well described by Weil: 

"It is indeed very remarkable that a patient that has been con- 
signed to death as a victim of a hopeless malady should regain his 
spirits and his appetite, when he is again confronted with the hope 
of a cure and of the eradication of his disease. It is a phenomenon 
well known to every student of the disease that a large proportion 
of cases responds in just this manner to any treatment that is 
offered them. Osier has described a case of cancer of the stomach 
in which the mere visit to a consultant of sanguine temperament, 
though poor judgment, whose assurance to the patient that there 
was no possibility of cancer, resulted in a disappearance of all 
symptoms and a gain of 18 pounds in weight. It is this psychic 
influence which has occasionally deluded the honest student of 
cancer cure, and which has also so generously played into the hands 
of the dishonest." 

The science of health includes not only the physical but 
also the mental. As a science it has definite and accurate 
provisions for the attainment of health. The laws must 
be obeyed. They .demand application in the lives of men 
and women and are most serviceable when guided by 



112 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

ideals and made a part of life by habituation. A life that 
is guided by the highest ideals in applying the scientific 
knowledge of the laws of health is the best illustration of 
artistic living. 

To live most and to serve best may with more success be 
achieved in this combination of ideals with science than 
in any other way. 

The following chapters will present the essential laws of 
hygiene and conditions for health; the hygienic facts will 
be of service in so far as they are used.

HYGIENE OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM 

Place of Movement in Human Development. We have 
seen that the simpler forms of life were concerned almost 
entirely with the processes of getting food and reproducing 
their kind. In the very simple types these functions were 
carried on without any directive force. Food came mainly 
from the surrounding media and was taken in by a process 
of absorption. Reproduction as a process was very sim- 
ple. It consisted in the adult dividing and producing two 
where there was only one before. 

The lowest worm-like animals gave apparently the first 
appearance of a muscular system and there followed soon 
after this a skeleton. Mollusks developed an external 
covering which limited locomotion, and it was not until 
the bony parts became elaborated as an internal skeleton 
that locomotion as seen in mammals came into prominence. 
The vertebral skeleton opened up tremendous possibilities 
because great masses of muscles could thus be used, and, 
in addition, there came increased opportunity for the ner- 
vous system in a rapidly changing environment. It is very 
important for us to learn this fact of evolution and develop- 
ment, because in our own training of the human being we 
should aline our methods with the methods used by nature 
in developing man and thus work in harmony with nature's 
laws. The increased efficiency of the nervous system 
that followed the increased power of the organs of loco- 
motion means for us today that we should emphasize and 
develop the muscles and skeleton before we attempt any 
serious training of the nervous system. Moreover, we can 
expect the nervous system to work most effectively if the 
muscular system is well organized and in good condition, 
and if the skeletal system is in such posture as to maintain 
proper functioning. It is an interesting and important 
fact that the attitude of the mind and the functioning 
of the brain are controlled and modified by the posi- 
tion of the body as a whole and by its several parts; 
and the use of the nervous system, as pointed out by 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 115 

James, 1 to insure that every sensory stimulus shall result 
in a muscular or motor response suited to the emergency, 
shows the mutual reliance of these two systems upon each 
other. 

Significance of Movement and Consciousness. It is 
very interesting that the story of development of higher 
forms of life in the animal and plant kingdoms associates, 
in general, in the former, consciousness and movement, 
and in the latter, unconsciousness and immobility. 2 For 
the animal a muscular system made movement possible 
and locomotion gave opportunity for new and changing 
situations. The stimulation of the sensory part of the 
nervous system was tremendous and called forth increased 
neural activity. Consciousness has in evolution, therefore, 
been associated very definitely with movement. 

It is significant in this connection to note that modern 
psychology is affirming this biologic fact in its statement 
that sensation is never complete until the centrally in- 
itiated impulse is expressed outward in a motor way and 
is returned with the significance of the act rounding out 
the circle and completing the circuit. 

Moreover, the meaning of motor training must be 
viewed in this newer light. The training of the hand in 
kinesthetic sense, the training of trunk and legs, means an 
awakening of consciouness with reference to the physical 
world that is extremely valuable. 

In contrast with this interesting development in the 
animal world there should be noted the characteristic im- 
mobility of the higher plants and its accompanying un- 
consciousness. 

Consciousness and movement have been associated in 
evolution; consciousness and movement are to be associ- 
ated now because of the history of man. This means 
definitely does it not? that intelligence will not develop

fully in the sedentary and immobile individual. The 
brain has evolved concomitantly with vigorous activity 
of the muscular system. 1 This does not mean that one 
can hope to attain brilliance of intellect by gaining in- 
creasing power to lift heavy dumbbells. Mental power 
is gained and conserved by an intelligent care and pro- 
vision for the physical activities of the body. The law 
of mental growth follows closely the law of physical 
growth. 

Habits of Muscular Activity Characteristic of Different 
Stages of Human Development. The muscular move- 
ments of the newborn babe are very limited in type and 
in amplitude, and as they increase in number and range 
up to adolescence, there is one characteristic manifesta- 
tion. The movements of the child are large movements 
and the control over the trunk is more accurate and comes 
earlier than the control over hands and feet. The reason 
for this is to be found in the order of development of these 
muscles. The first muscles to appear in animal life were 
the muscles of the trunk; muscles of the upper and lower 
extremities came much later. The trunk muscles are, 
therefore, older, and in each individual of the race of man 
they develop first and are followed by the muscles that 
accomplish fine co-ordinations. Moreover, it will be re- 
called that the vital organs of life developed in correlation 
with the trunk muscles. This fact has tremendous con- 
notation in ordering our lives with reference to the develop- 
ment of strong vital organs. 

After adolescence the increased power of the individual 
to perform fine co-ordinations with the hand goes along 
with the increased power to co-ordinate the activities of 
the brain. The changes that have come in man's civilized

environment require the use of the smaller muscles of the 
body. These changes threaten his vitality because they 
eliminate very largely the fundamental muscles that are 
so important in maintaining the health and strength of 
the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, and 
nervous systems. Moreover, these changes have added to 
the ease with which man can obtain a livelihood because 
of the ever-increasing use of machinery requiring only 
the pushing of a button for operation. In short, the life 
of man in the factory and even to some extent on the farm 
is more and more becoming what it has been for the clerk 
for many years a sedentary life. Such alterations in 
the life of man bring advantages in many ways, but 
unless their limitations are understood and controlled 
both by the individual and the community the result will 
be definitely a loss of vitality to the nation. We can 
never put the nation back to spinning-wheels for the 
women and flails for the men. 

Since the life of many civilized men is and will be in the 
future a life in work of sedentary type, effort should be 
made to understand this fact and then to work out types 
of activity that will provide the margin of motor activity 
that man requires to maintain his own health and that of 
the race. Professor Hetherington 1 has outlined in valuable 
form (Table II, page 118) what is needed from five to 
eighteen years. 

After twenty years of age an hour should be given daily 
to motor recreation involving the use of the large muscles 
of the body. Anything less than that for most individuals 
will result in physical deterioration. We are unable to 
state the ideal degree of muscular development needed 
by man in different avocations. Theoretically, the lawyer, 
the doctor, the merchant require a less vigorous muscula- 
ture than the farmer, mechanic, or day laborer. In 
reality, this may not be true when viewed in terms of

The school years, from 5 to 16, are the strategic years for growth 
and development. The child requires muscle activities from four to 
six hours in this period. (By courtesy of Clark W. Hetherington.) 

fullest health and most satisfying happiness. Certainly, 
all men require a minimum physical development which 
would enable them to participate with pleasure in many 
forms of motor recreation. The narrow view that con- 
ceives man as giving all to vocation and only a pittance to 
recreation for "exercise" constricts the range and scope of 
human happiness. 

This minimum physical development should provide 
for all: 

1. Strength of trunk muscles to maintain an upright 

posture and to prevent any ptosis of vital organs. 

2. Strength of back and leg and feet muscles to produce: 

(a) Ease and elasticity of gait. 

(6) Power for walking, running, and jumping. 

3. Strength of arm and shoulder muscles sufficient to 

swing with reasonable skill a golf club, axe or 
racquet, to throw a ball, to row a boat or to paddle 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 119 

a canoe, to pull a rope, to control a horse, and to 
swim. Strength and skill should be sufficient to 
permit one to enjoy and to take satisfaction in 
such activities. 

Such a minimum, though generally stated, would pro- 
vide power for enjoyable motor activity. It would insure 
against the ptoses of adult life. It would tend to main- 
tain at normal the vital organs of the body. 1 

Beneficial Effects of Rational Exercise. By rational 
exercise is meant exercise that is suited to the individual's 
need. What is desirable activity for one person may be 
unwholesome for another. Suitability of exercise is de- 
termined by the following: 

1. The exercise for general effects should be natural. 

Through a long evolution man has developed a 
physical body in response to certain activities and 
needs. This body so developed will function best 
if exercised in movements similar in type to the 
activities that produced the body of man. Walk- 
ing, running, jumping, lifting, throwing, striking, 
hanging, and climbing are natural types. 

2. The exercise for special effects may be artificial, that 

is, designed to produce particular muscle action 
without reference to evolutionary prototypes. 
Thus, special corrective exercises for feet, spine, 
abdomen, chest, back, or other part of the body 
may be needed. 

3. Whether natural or artificial, rational exercise will 

not produce soreness or stiffness. The idea that 
an exercise must hurt in order to be effective is 
similar to the idea that a medicine must have a 
disagreeable taste and an unpleasant odor in 
order to be potent. That exercise is most scien- 
tific which produces increasing amounts of fatigue 
substances, causing increased resistance to fatigue, 
but at no time resulting in soreness and stiffness.

can Medical Association, March 9, 1912, pp. 685-690. 



120 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

With these brief reservations in mind the beneficial 
effects of rational exercise may be stated. They are: 

1. Increased circulation through the part (as in special 

corrective work) or through the entire body. 
This circulatory activity carries food to the tis- 
sues, removes waste, distributes the endocrin se- 
cretions, and equalizes the water and heat content 
of the body. 

2. Increased respiration that gives increased oxygena- 

tion of the blood, increased elimination of carbon 
dioxid, and increased oxygen supply to the tissues. 
These values are dependent upon body activity 
and do not flow from the respiratory movement 
itself. 

3. Increased elimination of waste through kidneys, 

lungs, intestines, and, to some extent, skin. 

4. Increased metabolic changes. Digestion is improved, 

assimilation accelerated, and nutrition in general 
heightened. 

5. Increased neural activity, resulting in part from the 

increased circulation and elimination, and in part 
from the awakened kinesthetic senses. 
General Effects. In vigorous activity there is an in- 
crease in the force and rate of the heart, the respirations 
are increased in depth and frequency, perspiration be- 
comes more marked, and more waste is eliminated. There 
is in this heightened activity of the body systems a more 
or less complete change in the liquids of the body. Com- 
bustion of chemical compounds in the cells releases new 
energy; old accumulations of waste are removed and all 
the mechanisms for action are put in tune. Even reflective 
states are assisted by exercise, although if carried to the 
point of fatigue, mental activity afterward is slowed down. 
The scientific use of exercise involves the selection of 
forms and the extent of action that will favor best the 
particular somatic result desired. The teacher or leader 
of physical education must be awake to all the possibilities 
here, and not prescribe exercise without careful determina- 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 121 

tion not only of the individual's condition but also of the 
program and duties and responsibilities that are to be 
met after the exercise is finished. 

Exercise stimulates growth. 1 Numerous observations 
confirm this statement. For the growing child this is 
essential. Contrariwise, overindulgence in athletic sport 
may so deplete the body of vitality that growth is retarded. 
Some of the most significant illustrations in the high 
school confirm this, notably overtrained athletes. 

Exercise is most popularly known for its development 
of muscles. More significant is its power to develop the 
organs of the vital systems. In this achievement, exercise 
stands alone as the only agent. It must be remembered, 
though, that only certain types of exercise achieve this 
result: types involving the use of the fundamental 
muscles. German and Swedish gymnastics and other 
formal systems that seek certain postural, localized, 
and static effects are not valuable in this sense, though 
for special conditions they may have a certain limited 
use. 

The body should be as sacred as a temple. Too often 
bodies are mere shells, wrecks that serve to house minds 
that have developed enormous receptive power, but 
minds lacking in power of initiative, wanting in force, 
direction, and enthusiasm. Persons of such unfortunate 
equipment do not have that quality of health that would 
enable them to live most and to serve best. 

Injurious Effects of the Sedentary Life. A life of 
sedentary living brings with it some real dangers to the 
vital organs of life. It must be remembered that for the 
best functioning of the whole man the physical and the 
psychical must be provided for, not only because a fuller 
life can be lived in that way but also because without the 
physical the very basis of the psychic is lost. It is not 
unusual to see an individual unduly neglectful of his 
physical life so that he can advance in his vocation.

More of health is traded for the rewards of sedentary 
work than is biologically desirable. 

The Heart. One of the first organs to feel the loss in 
strength is the heart. It must be remembered that the 
heart is strengthened by the exercise of the skeletal muscles 
of the body. 1 The only way in which a weak heart is to 
be made strong is by gradual and increasing amounts of 
physical work of the skeletal muscles. The college or 
high school boy or girl who seeks to escape the activities 
of the physical education program because his or her 
heart is weak and irregular is foregoing the only means of 
obtaining a strong and regular heart. The persons who 
are unable to run a city block or climb a hill because of 
palpitation of the heart muscle, are the ones who are 
handicapped not only as regards this particular type of 
activity but also by the deficiency of the circulation to 
the entire body for twenty-four hours out of each day. 
The number of people who are just below par because of 
heart weakness experience inefficiency and debility as 
compared with efficiency and strength. Instances may 
readily be cited of individuals who have done and are 
doing fine and excellent work with impaired hearts. The 
evidence is not complete. Its consummation would tell of 
breakdowns under extra heavy pressure, of times of 
lowered power, and of an almost constant fear that by 
"overdoing" a break would come. The surest and best 
way to condition oneself for the doing of a high type of 
work is to make sure so far as possible of a strong and 
efficient heart and circulatory system. 

The Lungs. Other organs that feel the loss of active 
exercise are the lungs. The function of the lungs, in part, 
is to bring oxygen into the blood in response to the needs 
of the body. During increased activity, when great 
amounts of oxygen are needed, the lungs respond by fre- 
quent and deep respirations. The venous blood in the 
lung capillaries is exposed to air of a high oxygen content. 

1 Tyler, G. M.: Growth and Education, Houghton Mifflin Co., 
Boston, 1907, Chap. II. 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 123 

There is no provision for the storing up in the lungs or in 
the body of oxygen for some future needs of the body. 
Oxygen burns (oxidizes) food materials as soon as it 
reaches the cells. Persons who live sluggish lives use the 
lungs relatively little because natural respiratory activity 
is automatically controlled by the needs of the body. 
This defect cannot be overcome by such a makeshift as 
"breathing exercises," because oxygen is only delivered to 
the cells in accordance with their needs. The only rational 
way to provide adequate oxygenation for the cellular 
materials of the body is by engaging in big muscle activity 
that results in deeper breathing without any control or 
direction on the part of the performer. 

The Muscles. As might be expected, the muscles of the 
body suffer in a direct way from the lack of activity. This 
is of little importance for health purposes as regards the 
muscles of the face; it is supremely important as regards 
the muscles of the trunk. The abdominal muscles play 
an important part in the maintenance of an upright 
posture and a slackness and weakness of these muscles 
results in a weak standing position. A weak posture 
shows an exceedingly unattractive body, and, in addition, 
has serious effect upon the position and functioning of the 
abdominal organs. 

Adaptation of Exercise. Exercise should be adapted to 
age, sex, occupation, climate, and the individual himself. 

To Age. In speaking of exercises for infants, Holt 1 
says: 

"This is no less important in infancy than in later childhood. 
An infant gets his exercise in the lusty cry which follows the cool 
sponge of the bath, in kicking his legs about, waving his arms, etc. 
By these means pulmonary expansion and muscular development 
are increased and the general nutrition promoted. An infant's 
clothing should be such as not to interfere with his exercise. Con- 
finement of the legs should not be permitted. In hospital practice 
I have often had a chance to observe the bad results which follow 
when very young infants are allowed to lie in the cribs nearly all 

1 Holt, L. E. : Diseases of Infancy and Childhood, D. Appleton & 
Co., New York, 1911, p. 7. 



124 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLlEft 

the time. Little by little the vital processes flag, the cry becomes 
feeble, the weight is first stationary, then there is a steady loss. 
The appetite fails so that food is at first taken without relish, then 
at times altogether refused; later vomiting ensues and other symp- 
toms of indigestion. This in many cases is the beginning of a steady 
downward course which goes on until a condition of hopeless ma- 
rasmus is reached. . . . Infants who are old enough to creep or 
stand usually take sufficient exercise unless they are restrained. At 
this age they should be allowed to do what they are eager to do. 
Every facility should be afforded for using their muscles. Exercise 
may be encouraged by placing upon the floor in a warm room a 
mattress or a thick "comfortable," and allowing the infant to roll 
and tumble upon it at will. A large bed may answer the same 
purpose." 

In the recommendations of Holt may be seen the prin- 
ciples which may effectively govern all children in the 
matter of exercise. There should not be undue restraint. 
The young child will run and play like all the young of 
animal life if it is not interfered with by certain conven- 
tions and social burdens placed upon the child by a 
thoughtless parent. The child who walks in the park with 
a nurse in order to advertise the social position of the 
parents, or is not permitted to play because of the danger 
of soiling kid gloves or fine dresses, is in serious danger. 
Such a child needs to be saved from his parents. It 
should be remembered that the child of the wealthy 
suffers just as severely, if not so frequently, as the child of 
the poor man from lack of nourishment of the body cells. 
The difference is that the rich child has plenty of oppor- 
tunity for food, but lacks the capacity for digestion and 
assimilation; the poor child could digest and assimilate if 
adequate food were available. 

In speaking of exercise for older children Dr. Holt 1 
says: 

"In older children every form of outdoor exercise should be en- 
couraged ball, tennis and all running games, horseback riding, the 
bicycle, tricycle, swimming, coasting, and skating. Up to the 
eleventh year no difference need be made in the exercise of the two 
sexes. Companionship is a necessity. Children brought up alone 
are at a great disadvantage in this respect, and are not likely to get 
as much exercise as they require. The amount of exercise allowed 

1 Holt, L. E.: Loc. cit., pp. 7, 8. 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 125 

delicate children should be regulated with some degree of care. 
It may be carried to the point of moderate muscular fatigue, but 
never to muscular exhaustion. The latter is particularly likely to 
be the case in competitive games. 

"Exercise should have reference to the symmetrical development 
of the whole body. In prescribing it the specific needs of the in- 
dividual child should be considered. By carefully regulated exer- 
cises very much may be done to check such deformities as round 
shoulders and slight lateral curvatures of the spine, and also to de- 
velop narrow chests and feeble thoracic muscles. For purposes like 
these gymnastics are exceedingly valuable to supplement out-of- 
door exercise, but they can never take their place." 

It is important to point out here that Dr. Holt is speak- 
ing of the child with physical defect when he recommends 
symmetric development. There is no reason to believe 
that he means the symmetry in body development that 
was sought so earnestly a few years ago by specialists in 
anthropometry. The child that is allowed to participate 
in all vigorous games will develop symmetrically enough 
to satisfy all except those who make symmetry a fetish to 
be worshiped. 

During the period of adolescence, when the body is 
growing rapidly and the vital organs are embarrassed to 
keep up the supply of energy for the rapidly growing 
body, it is important not to carry the exercise to extreme 
lengths. It should be remembered that in children the 
one quality that should not be tested is endurance. Many 
instances are on record of high school athletes being 
"burned out" by too intensive participation in scholastic 
sport. Exercise should be used to build strength and 
power in the youth, not to waste them. 

Exercise for Adults. Adults in general suffer from lack 
of exercise. The vocational interests of the majority of 
men and practically all women tend to center in sedentary 
activity. The adult has not carried on his interest in 
motor activities because of two defects in his training: 
1. The formal calisthenic training of school days offered 
no satisfying states and hence no habituation to 
exercise that would make for continuance after 
school days. 



126 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

2. The athletic games and sports learned in school were 
so highly organized and required such expensive 
and elaborate equipment that they were not pur- 
sued. 

That exercise is most serviceable for adults that uses 
the large muscles of the body in forms of activity which are 
pleasant, enjoyable, producing satisfaction, and that lead 
to habits of exercise. The most favorable forms to secure 
this state of affairs are swimming, hiking, camping with 
its varied activities, golf, tennis, skating, and coasting. 
To these should be added horseback riding, hunting, 
fishing, and gardening. 

After thirty years of age the adult may engage in 
activities requiring moderate endurance; he is less well 
adapted for speed effort. He is beginning to lose his 
elasticity and should never be tested in severe competition, 
although golf, swimming, hiking, and skating may be 
pursued to their limits. 

The perils of middle age are a gradual deterioration of 
muscle power with sagging of structures, notably the ab- 
dominal organs, that gradually lose their ability to 
function properly. These perils are to be overcome by 
daily physical activity. There is no short cut; no easy 
way out. 

Adaptation to Sex. There should not be any marked 
distinction in the type of exercise of the boy and girl up 
to and including the eleventh year. After that the change 
made should be in line with the teaching of biology as 
regards the difference in the sex characters and physical 
make-up dependent upon those characters. At one time 
the girl was regarded as a being unsuited for play and 
physical training. The Victorian period of English litera- 
ture shows us a girl who was interested chiefly in being 
unwell and ministered to as a weak sister. In America 
this type of girl is occasionally seen, but there is a healthy 
indication of more interest on the part of the girl and her 
parents in securing a vigorous foundation for the girl as 
well as the boy. It should be kept clearly in mind that 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 127 

both the girl and the boy are dependent equally upon the 
muscular system for the proper development and func- 
tioning of the vital organs of life. In both, the heart, the 
lungs, the digestive organs, and the nervous system must 
all rely upon the activity of the muscular system for 
efficient functioning. 

The boy and girl both need vigorous exercise, but there 
are some fundamental differences between the body of the 
boy and that of the girl which determine the kind and 
extent of the activity to be followed. In the first place, 
the skeletal framework of the girl presents some im- 
portant differences. The bones are lighter. The pelvis is 
much broader, which gives to the thigh bones a marked 
obliquity. The width of the pelvis interferes with the 
running ability of the girl; in all movements of the lower 
extremities, either in walking or running, there is a lateral 
sway of the pelvis; and the extent of this oscillation de- 
termines the speed of the individual in getting over the 
ground. Because of this one factor of body construction 
the girl is unable to run as fast or as far as the boy. It is 
this sort of biologic evidence that one must understand 
and respect, because one will not approve for the girl the 
kind of tasks held up to the boy. There are some people 
who feel that the girl should attempt to do the same 
physical feats of which the boy is capable. Such theory is 
distinctly contrary to. the teaching of nature, and if one 
desires to progress one must remember to act in harmony 
with nature's laws and not contrary to them. It should 
be stated, therefore, that it is important to develop 
standards of performance of the girl that will be her 
standards. Girls should not seek to do the events in 
which the boys excel because they are boys' events, but 
rather they should try to excel in performances belonging 
peculiarly to women. There is no feeling here that girls 
are inferior to boys; it is meant that girls are different. 
There is need to provide for girls types of activity that are 
suited to their needs, on the one hand, and in harmony 
with their powers on the other.

Adaptation to Occupation. When it is recalled that ex- 
ercise is of value because of its effects upon the vital proc- 
esses of life, it will be clear that the exercise necessary for 
health will vary in accordance with the activity of the 
person. The ditch digger at the end of a day's work does 
not need activity that will strengthen his heart and induce 
perspiration. He may, however, need activity of a kind 
that will have an exhilarating effect upon his nervous 
system. The clerk in a store engaged in sitting behind a 
counter and selling buttons does require effective stimula- 
tion of the lungs, heart, and skeletal muscles, and especially 
out of doors. In thinking of the adaptation of exercise to 
occupation it is important to remember that health is 
something more than the ability to eat and sleep. Health 
of the muscles and heart is important, but health of the 
nervous system must not be neglected. Exercise that is 
distasteful or uninteresting is not only of small value, but 
it may be positively injurious. For students in college as 
well as pupils in school, for clerks in stores as well as 
workers in the factory, the selection of exercise must be 
made on a basis of the person's occupation, and thus 
supply the margin of activity necessary to keep the entire 
body healthy and strong, a ready and willing servant of 
the mind. What this margin shall be varies with the 
vocation. But for all there is a minimum which will 
provide for strength and vigor of the vital organs and 
will keep the muscles in sufficient tone and strength to 
secure pleasure and satisfaction from motor activity. 
The individual with weak and flabby muscles cannot 
enjoy physical activity. The importance of joy in phys- 
ical activity cannot be overestimated. 

Adaptation to Climate. Climate rather naturally makes 
its own adaptation of the individual in the matter of 
exercise. Persons who live for any length of time in the 
South gradually develop a distaste for exertion of a 
physical kind. 1 In the North there is quite naturally an 

1 Huntington, E. : Civilization and Climate, Yale University 
Press, 1915, Chap. III. 



130 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

inclination even in winter for vigorous outdoor life. 
Nature should be followed here. The winter time is the 
most important time to carry on outdoor activities. 
Vigorous walking, outdoor games, skating, coasting 
these are the things to do. It is because of the limitations 
imposed by the weather that people live such unhygienic 
lives in the winter. For many it is a period of semi- 
hibernation. Because of this, and the resulting accumula- 
tion of waste materials, so many feel the need of a "tonic" 
in the spring. It is important to state here that the best 
tonic in the spring, especially after an inactive winter, is 
out-of-door exercise with a rather careful limitation of the 
diet. This point will be taken up later in more detail. 

Adaptation to the Individual. It may be stated that all 
persons without serious disease need the general effects 
of daily exercise. These may be secured by walking (not 
strolling aimlessly, but walking a distance of 2 miles in 
at least thirty minutes) , hiking, swimming, playing games 
such as golf, tennis, baseball, handball, and other sports. 

The cardiac patient may need restricted and graduated 
work; the tuberculous person may need absolute rest. 
Such cases need the care and advice that a skilled phys- 
ician can give. 

Relative Value of Different Activities. Not all exercise 
is wholesome. Some varieties are more desirable than 
others. The advocates of certain "systems" propose that 
it is only necessary to follow their method to secure health 
and happiness, if not life eternal itself. The virtue of 
their systems is likely to be greater the more they satisfy 
the needs of man as revealed by man's nature and develop- 
ment. On the contrary, many claim virtue because of 
certain "special" exercises which the founders "dis- 
covered." A consideration of the relative value of types 
is therefore important. 

Play, Games, Sports, and Athletics. Play forms seen in 
games, athletics, and aquatic and land sports afford the 
best type of exercise. They are the best for man because 
they are identical with or similar to the forms used by 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 131 

man in evolving from lower forms to his present position 
in the biologic scale. Man's body works best when 
exercised in movements very like the movements that 
produced his body. These activities as types, contrasted 
with calisthenics, are so much more satisfying because of 
the interest and mental exhilaration that comes in play 
forms. 

Dancing. Folk and natural dances are excellent forms 
of exercise. Women are finding great satisfaction also in 
certain rhythmic forms that have advanced beyond the 
old esthetic technic. 

Social dancing is wholesome exercise, natural in the 
form of movement, and physiologically valuable exercise 
if practised in a sanitary environment. Unfortunately, 
the late hours, the bad ventilation that so often accom- 
pany the social dance introduce factors that need to be 
controlled. 

From another standpoint the modern social dance is 
open to serious criticism because it is frequently licentious, 
and often immoral, and tends by its indirect influences to 
a lowering of standards and to a debasing of fine human 
relationships. The social dance involves fundamentally 
the romantic position; it is often erotic in character. 
Hence it should be controlled by the finest and most 
accepted standards that will help boys and girls to fine 
forms of expression. 

The young man or young woman who is interested in 
living most and in serving best ought to be concerned not 
only with the possession of splendid purpose but also in 
the expression of the finest and best in personality. It is 
not possible to "jazz" through an evening, cheek to cheek, 
body close to body, without arousing emotions and im- 
pulses that are biologic, natural and worthwhile, but 
emotions and impulses so strong and impelling that they 
lead frequently to undesirable, unsocial, and immoral 
forms of expression. 

Formal Gymnastics and Calisthenics. Exercises of this 
type are less valuable than games, sports, and athletics. 



132 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

They are useful in special cases to correct special defects. 
Their application to life is so limited that lengthy dis- 
cussion is unnecessary. 

Setting-up Drill. It ought to be possible for all persons 
to live in such a way that the activities of work or the 
activities of play provided all that was essential in phys- 
iologic results to keep the muscles in tone, the heart 
strong, and the different organic systems in good con- 
dition. There is here, as elsewhere in human life, con- 
siderable difference between the ought and the is. We are 
confronted with the fact that a very large number of 
people, especially professional and business men and 
women, follow pursuits that are strictly sedentary, and 
not conducive, under present social organization, to 
adequate participation in motor recreation. For these 
persons a setting-up drill taken every morning before the 
bath will be of real value in assisting to maintain the 
body in good physical condition. The following descrip- 
tion of the exercises appeared first in the Teachers Col- 
lege Record which has kindly given permission to repro- 
duce in part the author's original article: 

"In presenting a series of setting-up exercises it is important to 
emphasize certain limitations. It does not represent a complete 
system of physical education, nor may it be considered in all cases 
to provide everything that is necessary to maintain health. At 
best it is only a substitute for more wholesome exercise out-of-doors 
in the form of games and recreative sports. The following points, 
therefore, should be noted: 

1. There is no short cut, no royal road, no easy way to health. 
The development and preservation of physical vigor require intelli- 
gent care of the body and scrupulous regard for the laws of health. 
One cannot with safety and assurance contract a few muscles, 
breathe deeply a few times, and obtain organic strength. In addi- 
tion to exercise other factors must be considered, such as a healthful 
attitude of mind, the choice of proper recreation, the intelligent 
selection of food, the adjustment of work and play, and the care of 
the body functions. All are as important as exercise. It ought to 
be unnecessary to say that one cannot misuse the mind and body, 
and then breathe a few times, take a pill, and remain vigorous. 

2. Health exercises as a rule have been devised to produce effects 
which could be felt by the person taking them. The idea that an 
exercise must be felt in order to be valuable is similar to the idea 
that medicine must have a nasty taste and a mysterious color in 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 133 

order to be potent. On the contrary, the most desirable sort of 
physical training will not produce soreness and will in no way strain 
the muscles. 

3. Exercises usually offered to the public are based upon the 
artificial and unnatural movements of the Swedish or German 
systems. It should be appreciated more generally that the move- 
ments which man has made in developing from the lower forms of 
life into the human being that he now is are more suited to his needs 
than movements which are wholly unrelated to his phylogenetic 
inheritance. 

4. Many of the exercises often proposed are distinctly harmful. 
For example, the human being should not bend the trunk backward 
(except in corrective gymnastics where the support is controlled), 
and breathing exercises which have no relation to physiologic needs 
of the body are often injurious. 

The exercises that follow are natural movements; hence they are 
offered with the belief that they will be of some value to the sedentary 
worker in school or office. They will serve to provide some activity 
of a natural kind, and should be supplemented with as much whole- 
some out-of-door exercise as is necessary to provide that ''margin 
of motor activity" essential to individual health. 

They do not represent a complete system of body building. 
They are not devised to meet the play requirement of children nor 
the reactive needs of adults. They will set up the body, but they 
will not restore a damaged heart, nor bring strength to a paralyzed 
muscle. They will help, however, in securing good posture; but 
they will not cure a crooked back nor remove fat from the abdomen 
and deposit it on the shoulders. 

These exercises should be performed on arising in the morning 
and should be followed by the morning bath. They are devised 
to produce wholesome effects upon circulation and respiration, and 
they will aid digestion and elimination. Since they are devised to 
secure an uplift of the body in all the movements, the accent should 
be upward. In addition, the trunk muscles are vigorously worked 
and the correct use of the foot is favored. 

The necessity of supplementing these movements with out-of- 
door exercises must again be emphasized. Such activities as walk- 
ing, hiking, tennis, swimming, coasting, skating, horseback riding, 
canoeing, golf, dancing, athletic sports and games are suggested, 
but the extent of participation in them must be determined by the 
needs, capacities, and limitations of the individual. 

The following description should be carefully noted and the pic- 
tures studied in learning the exercises. 

STANDING (Fig. 5) 

The standing exercise (Fig. 5) is used to help in achieving a good 
standing posture. Much of the posture work in the schools is bad 
on account of the rigid and unnatural position attained. The body 
is too frequently put into such a posture that the relation of parts 
prevents quick and controlled action. One should seek to attain 
in standing an erect position without rigidity, thus insuring health- 



134 



PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 



ful functioning of abdominal organs, proper use of joints, and effi- 
cient use of the musculature of the body. 

EXERCISE : 

Stand with the feet parallel to each other and 6 to 8 inches 
apart. Place one foot (either one) 3 to 4 inches in front of the 




other. Have weight on both feet disposed to their outer edges. 
This position of the feet produces balance, pivot, and control 
Push the trunk upward and lift the abdominal wall upward' 
Retain a feeling of relaxation in the shoulders, but secure a sensa- 
tion of extension and lengthening of the body without contracting 
or tensing the muscles (Fig. 5). 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 135 

GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE: 

1. Avoid rigidity. 

2. Secure straightening of the spine, but keep the shoulder 
muscles relaxed. 

3. Keep the weight off the heels. 

4. Pull the abdominal wall upward and keep the lower half of 
the abdominal wall constantly flattened. 

COMMAND: 

For individual performance of the exercises no commands are 
required. Directions are given, however, for use in group instruc- 
tion where commands are necessary. 

The commands have two parts separated by a pause. The 
length of the pause should vary according to the needs of the 
group and the exercise. The first part of the command is pre- 
paratory; the second is executive. These parts should be spoken 
in such a way as to convey in the voice the manner of action 
expected. 

The command for this exercise is: Class Stand! 

STRETCHING (Figs. 5 and 6) 

This is a natural movement that straightens the spine, lifts the 
chest, and overcomes the sagging of the abdominal muscles so com- 
monly seen in adults. 

EXERCISE : 

On the command One! push the arms easily upward and rise on 
the toes as far as possible. Reach up as far as possible as if trying 
to get an object from a high place (Fig. 6). 

On Two! let the arms sink and the heels touch the floor, but 
retain as long as possible the sensation of extension (Fig. 5). Do 
not let the body droop. The development of the proper muscle 
sensation is important. 

GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE : - 

1. Avoid tenseness and rigidity. 

2. Do not bend backward. 

3. Avoid angular movement of the arms. Do not swing them 
up; push them up. 

4. Perform with a feeling of relaxation rather than contraction. 

5. Repeat the movement ten times. (In the beginning, two or 
three times is sufficient for all the movements which are to be 
repeated.) 

6. Do not execute the movement rhythmically, for in rhythmical 
exercises it is more difficult to get the correct form at the end of 
the movement. The form in this movement is important. 

COMMAND : 

1. Ready for Stretching Stand! (Take the position in Fig. 5.) 

2. Stretching One! (Fig. 6) Two! (Fig. 5).

THROWING (Figs. 7 and 8) 

This is a natural movement used by man in throwing a ball at 
an object. In learning movements that involve complex co-ordina- 
tions, do not think of the "end" of the movement, but keep clearly in 
mind the "means" to that end. Follow closely the directions for 
arm, leg, and trunk movement, and the co-ordination will come. 




This movement is a powerful trunk exercise. It uses the back 
and side muscles and brings into play the large muscles of both arms 
and both legs. 

The first part of the movement (Fig. 7) corresponds to the second 
part (Fig. 8) in position of trunk and legs. If the arms in Fig. 7 
were placed in the position shown in Fig. 8, the similarity in the two 
parts of the movement would be instantly apparent. 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 137 

EXERCISE : 

Stand with feet about 24 inches apart and with the left foot 
about 6 inches in front of the right. On One! clasp hands lightly, 
waist high as shown in Fig. 7, shift weight to the right foot, bend 
the right knee, draw both hands to the right, twist the trunk to the 
right, and turn the head to the right. The left leg is straight 
and relaxed and the left heel is off the floor. The trunk is in- 
clined forward (Fig. 7). 

On Two! throw with the right hand, twisting the trunk sharply 
to the left. The left knee is bent and the right knee is straight 
with the heel off the floor. Notice that the body forms a straight 
line from head to right heel (Fig. 8). The weight has been 
transferred to the left leg. The right arm is forward and the left 
arm back (Fig. 8). The force of the throw turns the body in 
Fig. 8 a greater distance than in Fig. 7, and so the left foot is 
turned in the direction of the throw. 

GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE: 

1. Avoid angles and sharp tensions in the movement. 

2. Make all movements flowing, smooth, and harmonious. 

3. Avoid conscious contractions. Do not try to contract the 
muscles. Perform the movement and the muscles will contract to 
carry out your desires. 

4. Repeat the exercise ten times. At first separate it into two 
parts. After it is learned make it continuous, and change from the 
position in Fig. 7 to that in Fig. 8 and back to the position in Fig. 7 
without interruption. 

5. After strength and power are developed, the movement may 
be performed rhythmically twenty times. 

COMMAND : 

1. Ready for Throwing Stand! (Stand with feet about 24 
inches apart and with the left foot about inches in front of the 
right.) 

2. Throwing One! Two! 

3. To command the rhythmical throwing, set the rhythm that 
is desired. Then command, Throwing in Rhythm Begin! Count 
1, 2, 1, 2, to mark the rhythm. 

4. To halt the group, command, Class Halt! inserted in the 
series of 1, 2. 

5. Class Stand! Standing position as given in Standing exer- 
cise is taken. 

LIFTING (Figs. 9, 10, and 11) 

This is a natural movement used in lifting an object from one 
side of the body to the other, or from a low level to a higher one. 
It is an exercise of the back and legs and may be made very vigor- 
ous by reaching low and lifting high 

The movement as given has two phases: low lifting and high 
lifting.

PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 



EXERCISE OF Low LIFTING: 

On command One! bend the right knee and reach with arms to 
the right of the right foot about 12 inches from the floor (Fig. 9). 
The left leg is straight, the back is flat, and the movement occurs 
in the hip- and knee-joints. On Two! transfer the weight to the 
left foot and lift the object secured in command One! to the left 




and into the same relative position as in Fig. 9. Then the left 
knee will be bent, the right leg straight, and the arms will be to 
the left of the left foot about 12 inches from the floor. 

EXERCISE OF HIGH LIFTING: 

On One! assume the position as shown in Fig. 10. The hands 
reach the floor and there is greater bending in the right knee and 
hip joints. The back remains flat and the left leg is essentially in 
the same position as shown in Fig. 9. 



i 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 139 

On Two! lift the object to the left and place it high above the 
head (Fig. 11). Vigorous muscular extension should occur in this 
part of the movement while the weight is being shifted to the left 
foot and the right leg is relaxed with the right heel off the ground.

GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE: 

1. Avoid tenseness in the movement, seek smoothness and con- 
stantly adjust the body in the different parts of the exercise by 
comparing the movement with the illustration. 

2. Secure uplift of the body in the high lifting and get the com- 
plete extension that would come in placing a box on a high shelf. 
(In Fig. 11 the upward pull of the trunk is indicated in the ver- 
tical folds of the shirt.) 

3. Repeat each lift ten times. 



140 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

COMMAND . 

1. Ready for Lifting Stand! (Stand with feet 24 to 28 inches 
apart, parallel and with the weight disposed to their outer edges.) 

2. Low Lifting One! Two! 

3. High Lifting One! Two! Start the high lifting part of the 
time on the left and part of the time on the right. 

CLIMBING (Figs. 5 and 12) 

Climbing has always played a prominent part in the history of 
man. Our arboreal ancestors excelled in it and our children today 
at an early age seek to recapitulate their racial history in the same 
action. This movement is a powerful exercise for the legs and se- 
cures strong contraction of the abdominal muscles. As shown in 
PMg. 12, it represents reaching upward and grasping an object, as a 
limb of a tree or ladder rung and pulling up one leg to obtain sup- 
port preparatory to pushing up the body. The arm movement is 
identical with the Stretching exercise. 

EXERCISE : 

On One! reach upward with the arms, raise the right knee 
forward and push the body upward on the ball of the left foot. 
Secure vigorous stretching upward. This is to be the accented part 
of the movement (Fig. 12). On Two! return to standing position 
(Fig. 5). 

GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE: 

1. Be careful not to droop on Two! Keep the erect position as 
shown in Fig. 5. 

2. Accent the count One! 

3. The movement may be performed rhythmically, but the 
rhythm should be slow and the accent always on the upward 
movement. 

COMMAND : 

1. Ready for Climbing Stand! (Fig. 5). 

2. Climbing One! (Fig. 12) Two! (Fig. 5). 

WALKING (Figs. 5 and 13) 

The walking movement represents a natural exercise performed 
with movement of the opposite arm and leg. The act should be 
executed with the feet parallel and with the weight on their outer 
edges. The illustration (Fig. 13) exaggerates the natural move- 
ment in some of its phases, but should be practised as shown (Fig. 
13) to secure the freedom in walking that is desired. Walking can 
be something more than a means of progression. Smooth arm move- 
ment and vigorous leg action will bring exhilaration into an act that 
is frequently rendered difficult by improper habits and clothing. 

EXERCISE : 

On One! raise the left knee forward and swing the right arm 
forward. The body remains poised on the ball of the right foot 
(Fig. 13). On Two! reverse the position of arms and legs. 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 141 



GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE: 

1. Keep the accent upward. 

2. In walking avoid the pounding of the heels on the floor. The 
heels strike first always, but the accent of the movement should 
be upward and forward, never downward. 

3. This movement is not to be confused with the aimless 
strolling that is seen so frequently. 

4. The rhythmical and continuous walk is used as soon as the 
idea of the arm and leg movement is comprehended. 




COMMAND : 

1. Ready for Walking Stand! (Fig. 5). 

2. Walking One! (Fig. 13) Two! (Fig. 13). 

3. Walking in Rhythm Begin! See directions for commanding 
a rhythmical exercise in Throwing. 



142 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

RUNNING (Figs. 5 and 14) 

This is a natural exercise performed on the balls of the feet with 
vigorous thrusting upward of the knees and free and vigorous swing- 
ing of the arms (Fig. 14). It will be noticed that the right arm is 
forward when the left knee is forward. This opposition in walking 
and running is a fundamental compensation in the movement of 
the body to secure proper balance, direction, and control. This 
exercise vigorously stimulates the circulatory and respiratory 
systems, and will aid in improving all the functions of the organs 
supplying the body with energy. It should be possible for one to 
run and enjoy the movement (Fig. 14). 

EXERCISE : 

On One! swing the right arm forward and thrust the left knee 
upward and forward at the same time pushing the body upward 
on the ball of the right foot. 

On Two! reverse the position of the arms and legs and push the 
body up on the ball of the left foot. 

GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE: 

1. Run a few times at first. After power and endurance are 
developed, the run should be continued for several minutes. 

2. Accent the upward movement. Do not strike the floor hard 
on the down stroke. 

3. After the co-ordination is learned, the run should be executed 
in rhythm. 

COMMAND : 

1. Ready for Running Stand! (Fig. 5). 

2. Running One! (Fig. 14) Two! (Fig. 14). 

3. Running in Rhythm Begin! See directions for rhythmical 
movements in Throwing. 

JUMPING (Figs. 15 and 16) 

To clear an obstacle or grasp an object above one's standing 
reach one resorts to jumping. This is therefore a natural move- 
ment and it should be performed naturally. The first part of the 
movement (Fig. 15) uses the muscles of the entire body, and in the 
second part (Fig. 16) the body is thrown into the air by the vigor- 
pus contraction of leg, back, and arm muscles. In the continuous 
jump the landing position, shown in Fig. 15, serves as the start for 
the next jump. At first the movement should be practised without 
the jump. 

EXERCISE : 

On One! bend the knee- and hip-joints and incline the body 
forward (Fig. 5). Swing the arms downward and backward 
elevating the heels slightly. Note that the trunk is inclined and 
not held in the upright and unnatural position sought in some gym- 
nastic systems. On Two! swing arms forward and upward, and 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 143 

spring into the air (Fig. 16). The landing follows as a result of 
the movement and should assume the position shown in Fig. 15. 

GUIDES IN PERFORMANCE: 

1. Before trying the jump the movement of preparation 
(Fig. 15) should be practised until the muscles are strong enough 
to jump without straining them. 




2. At first only make one jump (Fig. 10). Land with the knees 
bent and the heels off the ground. 

3. Secure lightness in the movement and avoid landing heavily. 

4. After the strength of the legs has been developed, continuous 
jumping should be performed. Gradually increase the number 
of jumps from one to five or six. 



144 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

COMMAND : 

1. Preparation for Jumping One! (Fig. 15) Two! (Fig. 5). 
This movement should be performed six to ten times each day 
until the muscles are strong enough to make the jump. 

2. Jumping One! (Fig. 15) Two! (Fig. 16) Three! (Fig. 5). 
On completing the jump, the body assumes the position shown in 
Fig. 15 and then comes into the standing position shown in Fig. 5. 

3. Jumping in Series One! (Fig. 15) Jump! (Fig. 16) 
Jump! Jump! 

The command Jump! is used as soon as the landing is made and 
is repeated as often as desired. At first not more than two jumps 
in series should be made; later a series of six and in some cases 
more may be used. 

Habits of Exercise. It is well known that one cannot 
build up in school days a store of health that will last for 
the rest of life. The star football player in college deteri- 
orates rapidly after school days unless he continues his 
physical activity in some form. 

College men and women ought to develop during 
school days a skill in and love for some sport, game, or 
physical activity which they will follow after school days 
are over. Activities lending themselves to such habitu- 
ation are swimming, tennis, handball, and walking. To 
enjoy a "hike," to get out in the open spaces, to hunt, to 
fish, to ride horseback, to row a boat, to chop wood, to 
play golf, to grow things in the garden are health-produc- 
ing activities. Habituation to physical activity is one of 
the goals that should be set not only for every college man 
and woman, but for all persons in the formative periods of 
school life. 

All the Factors in Health Important. In any health- 
building program care must be taken not to attribute to 
exercise more than belongs to it. In focusing on exercise 
there is a danger of neglecting other important health 
measures without which the greatest health cannot be 
attained. There are many individuals who live physically 
active lives, but who are lacking in vitality and vigor. 

Other important considerations in a health-building 
program are care of the body as regards bathing, eating, 
sleeping, eliminating, dressing, and forms of recreation. 
There must be also appreciated in this connection the 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 145 

influence of mental states on physical health. Without 
stating at this time the psychology of related mental and 
physical states it should be noted that mental reactions to 
situations are important modifiers of organic processes. 

We need, therefore, in the statement of the health needs 
of the individual something more than playgrounds, 
gymnasia, and turnverein. We need the first two cer- 
tainly, but in co-operation with these we need more 
hygiene in the schools, better sanitation in the schools, 
more opportunity for wholesome recreation for adults, and 
less transmission of communicable diseases 1 ; we need in- 
struction in the schools that will not only enable the child 
to develop into an industrially or professionally intelligent 
man or woman but also a chance for that child to develop 
the characteristics that will make him or her a good 
parent. It is coming to be appreciated that home eco- 
nomics may be very valuable for the training of the girl; 
it is to be recognized that certain phases of the conduct 
and organization of the home may very well be given to 
boys. Both boys and girls need instruction in the home 
training and care of children. It is rather interesting that 
babies have been born into civilized homes for several 
years, and in that time a certain body of information has 
been developed with reference to the training of children. 
Nevertheless, we allow young people to be educated in the 
schools and marry and bear children without giving them 
any scientific knowledge that would enable them to do 
the best that was possible for them to do. Of course, in- 
numerable clinics are provided in the large cities for the 
curing of infants after they have disease, but the intelligent 
and wise thing to do would be to instruct prospective 
parents at a time when they could be taught with some 
chance of preventing and correcting the intolerable con- 
ditions that at present prevail in the care and training of 
children.

A broad view of the health of the individual will include 
much more than exercise in a program that aims to 
achieve fineness in living and in service. It is the limited 
view that produces the queer anomalies seen at times in 
large cities when members of athletic club or turnverein 
will go to the gymnasium to engage in exercises ostensibly 
for the purpose of health, and will go out from the place 
and violate all the laws of health. There is need for an 
understanding of all the factors that enter into the pro- 
duction of health, and such conviction concerning human 
duty that the knowledge will be translated into effective 
action. 

HYGIENE OF THE SKELETON 

The Matter of Posture. The bones of the skeleton are 
for the purpose of protection to certain parts of the body, 
for points of attachment for muscles, and for support to 
organs and structures. In order that the child develop 
in the proper way it is necessary that the bones of the 
skeleton retain the shape and position in the body which 
will enable them to perform these functions. There is 
great importance, therefore, in the maintenance of the 
correct position of the bony parts of the body. This is of 
immense significance especially in childhood because the 
period of childhood determines the shape and position of 
the body in adult life. Correct posture modifies body 
movement and conditions the development of the vital 
organs, so that it should be sought at all times. It is very 
much worth while to acquire correct motor habits, on the 
one hand, and strong and sound organs on the other. 

The correct upright position of the body does not call 
for an erectness that is sometimes asked for in gymnastics. 
It calls for an erectness in which the general line of the 
body is straight, the head poised on top of the chest, and 
not projecting forth at an angle like a gargoyle on the 
cathedral Notre Dame, the abdomen flat and contracted, 
and the weight placed so that the body can be moved 
readily in any direction. 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 147 

Correct posture of the body cannot be defined adequately. 
A definition is incapable of expressing all that must be 
sought in the body from head to foot, but one can acquire 
appreciation of what is desirable by being guided by the 
best in living and art forms that express in good posture, 
elevated, optimistic, and happy states of mind. Such a 
form as the Winged Victory shows good posture. The 
reason for its excellence lies in the thought back of the 
motor expression. 

Posture is an expression of the mental and physical 
state; also, posture may modify and control mental states. 
It is possible by assuming an erect posture, by giving an 
appearance and expression of joyfulness, cheer and op- 
timism, to replace a depressing mood with the opposite 
emotional state. The cultivation of a happy, cheerful, 
optimistic nature more readily achieves results when 
efforts are also made to walk with an elastic, springy 
step, to hold the head erect and the abdomen flat. 

Individuals taking too little exercise are not infre- 
quently equipped with such weak muscles that it is im- 
possible for the parts of the body to be held in their proper 
position. Too frequently college girls and other young 
women who have neglected their physical training and 
games present bodies so miserably weak that the effort to 
stand erect is muscularly so fatiguing that the upright 
position is never held in an habitual way. These weak 
sisters try to cover their infirm and ineffective bodies by 
masking it behind a pose or a slouch that may happen at 
the time to be in style; but only the thoughtless are fooled. 
Such posture is essentially the posture of a frail body. It 
represents a body that is unable to do the work and meet 
the responsibilities that come with adult life, with mar- 
riage, and motherhood. Such girls, instead of possessing 
an attraction, unfortunately own a body that is relatively 
less able to express and receive happiness, to work and 
achieve results, to serve and receive service. 

Value of Good Posture. Although it is exceedingly 
difficult to define good posture, it is not at all difficult to 



148 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

realize the advantage of a posture in which the parts of 
the body at mechanical advantage and the body as a 
whole are responsive to the needs of the environment. The 
values flowing from such a posture are several: 

1. Hygienic value: The erect, straight, vibrant body 

has its organs properly suspended so that bodily 
functions are more complete and perfect. 

2. Economic value: Good posture pays. It speaks of 

the spirit within the body. The young man or 
woman seeking a business position portrays his or 
her mental energy and alertness by the way he or 
she stands and walks. 

3. Social value: Despite the influence of pernicious and 

silly styles, it may be said that personal attractive- 
ness is more properly measured by a splendid 
carriage of the body rather than by a "debutante 
slouch." 

4. Spiritual value: The spirit is uplifted with a physical 

uplift of the trunk. The glory of the rising sun is 
never seen by one walking with protruding head 
and abdomen and flat-feet. 

Four Important Positions. There are four positions of 
the body that are important because of their influence on 
health and happiness. Sitting, lying, standing, and 
walking are such common postures that they influence 
greatly bodily activity. If correctly performed, the in- 
fluence is good; if done badly, the result is inefficiency 
and frequently ill health. 

We sit more than our ancestors did. Much sitting has 
caused weakness of trunk muscles, and much bad sitting 
has resulted in abnormalities of the trunk itself. One 
should sit in a chair so that the trunk is straight. Bending 
the body forward should occur at the hip-joint. To pre- 
vent bad trunk position it is helpful to sit far back in the 
chair. Chairs that are too high or too deep prevent 
proper sitting. 

In reclining, relaxation of all muscles should occur. 
Complete relaxation is not possible in lying on the back. 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 149 

It is generally agreed that lying on the right side 1 (or 
partially on the face) is more desirable than lying on the 
back, because it favors muscular relaxation and makes 
less pressure on the heart. 

Standing is very tiresome and fatigues one more than 
walking. This is due to the slowing of the circulation in 
the legs. This fatigue cannot be overcome except by 
activity, but it can be lessened by a posture which facili- 
tates the blood flow. The body should be balanced on the 
balls of the feet with the weight on the outer side. Keeping 
the weight poised and the abdominal muscles flat will 
assist the return of venous blood as well as contributing 
markedly to general well being. 

It has been said that walking is a lost art. It is true 
that people walk less frequently today than formerly, 
but the growing interest in walking is a most hopeful 
sign for health. In walking the weight should be carried 
on the outer side of the feet, and the feet should be used 
in a parallel position so that the toe will point directly 
forward. Toeing out and throwing the weight on the 
inner side of the foot are productive of arch trouble. 

But in addition to these mechanical points in walking 
it is important to note that the way we walk depends very 
largely upon the way we think and feel. That drab serious- 
ness that clothes so many of us with its colorless mantle 
affects even our walk. Cabot, 2 with wonderful spirit, 
writes: 

"What is this melancholy and crestfallen line of persons, whom I 
see moving along Beacon Street or Commonwealth Avenue toward 
the heart of the city, a little before 9, in the crisp and frosty morn- 
ing. So mechanical and spiritless is their gait as they plod along 
that one might fancy them members of the sad, exploited proletariat, 
crushed by overwork, exhausted by want of sleep. In fact, they 
are prosperous bankers and lawyers on their way to business, and 
the only trouble with them is that they have just lapsed into being 

1 Other factors, such as lighting, ventilation, or noise, may more 
readily determine whether the sleeping position shall be right or 
left side. Other things being equal, the right side is preferable.

1914, p. 93.

serious and serious only. It has never occurred to them that walk- 
ing could be anything better than a means of sober progression. 
Poetry in walking? Don't suggest that to practical men. They'll 
think you a dangerous character." 

Prevention of Common Skeletal Deformities. The 
skeleton may develop deformities due to improper posture, 
lack of sufficient food of the proper kind, unusual loads 
imposed upon the bony parts, either as severe strain in 
occupation or as increased weight, sequels of disease, or 
the actual process of a destructive disease itself. The 
common deformities relate to the spine and to the feet. 

Curvature of the Spine. There are two main types of 
abnormal curvature of the spine: one from front to 
back; the other from side to side. The former results 
in round shoulders (kyphosis) or hollow back (lordosis); 
the latter in lateral curvature (scoliosis) of a mild or 
severe grade. 

Round shoulders and hollow back are largely the result 
of poor posture in work and play, incorrect adjustments of 
the parts of the body. They can be corrected by proper 
exercises and the will to overcome faulty habits. 

Lateral curvature frequently follows infantile paralysis, 
and the mild cases of this disease probably provide a 
large number of the scolioses seen. Other causes which 
have been suggested are carrying of books on one arm, 
standing on one foot, and writing at a desk of improper 
height. Curvatures of a postural kind can readily be 
corrected by corrective gymnastics if the individual is 
interested to overcome the defect; those resulting from 
disease are more difficult to control. 

Shoulder Braces. Many parents are led to suppose that 
shoulder braces are effective means for correction of round 
shoulders. This is absolutely wrong. The wearing of 
braces is distinctly harmful in that they do the work that 
the back muscles should do, and hence allow these muscles 
to become still weaker and less effective agents of body 
control. In the growing period of childhood postural de- 
formities more frequently occur. They should receive 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 151 

attention at that time. This should be in the form of cor- 
rective exercises prescribed by physician or medical 
gymnast who knows the problem. It is very important to 
select some one whose personality will arouse and hold 
the interest of the child in striving to overcome the de- 
fective condition. 

Weak, Deformed, and Flat-feet. The normal human 
foot is constructed of bones arranged in such fashion that 
a long arch is made on the inner aspect of the foot, and a 
transverse one in the region of the ball of the foot. These 
arches are sustained by ligaments of the foot and by 
muscles of the foot and leg. The entire mechanical 
structure of the foot indicates its use to be as follows : 

1. The foot in action should be placed on the ground 

with the line of direction parallel to the line of 
movement. The toes should point forward then, 
and neither be turned outward nor inward. 

2. The weight of the body should be carried forward 

from the heel to the ball of the foot with its dis- 
position always to the outer part of the foot. 

3. In walking the heel should strike the ground first, 

and the weight then be transferred to the toes. 

Every step should produce elevation of the body 

on the ball of the foot. 

Causes of Foot Weakness and Deformity. The cause 
of most foot troubles is improper shoes. Shoes too narrow, 
too short, of improper lines, with high heels, are especially 
condemned. Many young people permit the shoes sales- 
man to make the foot fit the shoe. The principle to be 
applied is that the shoe must fit the foot. 

Points of a Good Shoe. The style today may be high 
tops or low oxfords, ties or buttons, military heel, or the 
extreme French. These are incidental and meaningless 
for those who see straight and refuse to get their values 
mixed. The thoughtless, the careless, the vain will run 
after the baubles of style and be handicapped in action 
and in freedom of movement. Others, seeing real values, 
will look for the following in choosing a shoe: 



152 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

1. An approximately straight inner line from heel to 

toe. Some feet show an inflare and some an out- 
flare. There are shoes to fit these types. Most 
feet show a straight inner line and, as a rule, the 
straight line test for shoes should be applied. 

2. Front part of the shoe shall be as broad as the foot 

for which it is designed. 

3. The heel shall not be over 1J inches high and shall 

be as broad on its wearing surface as the human 
heel. 

4. The shoe should fit snugly around the arch and 

instep of the foot and loosely over the toes. 

5. Patent leather shoes should not be chosen because 

they do not allow free ventilation of the feet. 

Rubber heels are distinctly valuable for city wear. 
The human body developed its structure and functions 
with reference to an agricultural type of life. While ad- 
justments may be going on in the body fitting it to city 
conditions, such as hard floors and pavements, it is never- 
theless good hygiene to use an appliance such as the 
rubber heel to relieve the body of jar as much as possible. 
The relief of fatigue and the increased sense of elasticity are 
values significant enough to warrant the use of rubber heels. 

Flat-feet. Many causes may contribute to produce 
flat-foot. This unfortunate condition should have the 
care of an expert in such matters. Modification in occupa- 
tion, reduction of weight, change in manner of walking, use 
of orthopedic shoes all may be necessary to effect a cure. 

Exercises for Weak or Fallen Arches. If the long arch 
of the foot is weak, if pain is beginning, the following pro- 
cedure is important: 

1. Examine the shoe to see if it is at fault. If so, 

correct. 

2. Note whether an increase in weight has occurred. If 

so, reduce. 

3. If occupation involves standing for long periods, try 

to adjust by sitting at work and begin walking 
every day. 



HYGIENE OF MUSCULAR AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS 153 

4. In walking note as follows: 

(a) Keep weight always on outer side of foot. 
(6) Keep feet parallel in walking. Do not turn 
feet outward. 

(c) Let the heel hit the ground first and then 

transfer the weight forward along the outer 
edge of foot to the ball. 

(d) Push off strongly with the toes and do not let 

the leg swing entirely from the hip. 

5. Practice daily the following exercises: 

(a) Lie on the back and flex and extend the ankles 
as far as possible, laying most stress on the 
flexion. (Bring toes up toward knees.) 

(6) With the ankle flexed as far as possible practice 
bending the toes down toward the sole of 
the foot in an effort to grasp the sole. 

(c) Sit on a chair or edge of the bed and try 

grasping and holding a lead pencil with the 
toes. 

(d) With the legs extended and together try to

If the arch condition is not corrected by the above pro- 
cedure, see an orthopedic surgeon at once. 

Disturbance in the arch in the front part of the foot 
requires a pad for support. This should be supplied by an 
orthopedic surgeon. 

Perils of Maturity. The joints and ligaments of the 
body suffer from two deficiencies in mature years: 

1. Increase in body weight without a corresponding 

increase in supporting strength. 

2. Decrease in tone of the ligaments due to general loss 

in body tone accompanying the sedentary life. 
These conditions are to be combated by keeping the 



154 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

weight at the desired average for the height, and by im- 
provement of strength and tonicity of ligaments by ex- 
ercise, outdoor air, rest, and recreation. To maintain the 
body at a level of efficiency that will make possible the 
best work and the largest happiness requires expenditure 
of time in care of the body and its use in motor activities. 
To give this time from vocation is often difficult; to achieve 
efficiency in any other way is impossible.

Sources of Energy. The sources of human energy were 
discussed in Chapter IV. Ultimately, we say that energy 
comes from food. Sherman 1 says: "The activities on 
which the life of the body depends involve a continuous 
expenditure of energy and the constant exchange of 
material." This continuous expenditure of energy is de- 
pendent upon food taken into the body, and this food 
serves not only to provide the known chemical compounds 
which directly release energy but also it provides sub- 
stances serving to stimulate and promote growth and to 
regulate body processes. Health, as evidenced in activity 
or in growth of the body, is seen to be dependent upon not 
merely chemical compounds that will produce upon di- 
gestion so many heat units. Normal growth, normal 
work, and power of normal reproduction will be seen to 
be due to other substances in food that do not yield 
calories, but serve as regulators, organizers, and stimulators 
of bodily activity. The old emphasis upon the caloric 
yield has been broadened to include other important 
factors in determining man's dietary. The chief functions 
of food then are, as Sherman 2 suggests, "(1) To yield 
energy, (2) to build tissue, (3) to regulate body processes." 

Digestion, Assimilation, and Nutrition. The rough 
masses of food are made available for use in the body by a 
physiochemic change produced when food is brought in 
contact with various juices of the alimentary tract. By 
this change chemical units are separated out to be used 
in growth of the organism, in the maintenance of the life 
activities, and repair of parts. These units are taken up 
by the tissues; they are assimilated into the cells where 
they will serve. The final result is good nutrition of the 
organism if sufficient energy has been supplied for action 
and if a normal body has been secured through a proper 
supply of building and regulating material. 

Basal Metabolism. The foods taken into the body are 
the source then of energy either for action or for tissue

millan Co., New York, 1920, p. xi. 2 Ibid.

building. They are made available for release of energy 
by a series of chemical changes that occur in digestion and 
later in assimilation in the tissues. Chemical changes 
occur when energy substances are burned in the body. 
In these chemical changes, known as metabolism, there is 
always a production of heat, sometimes apparently as a 
by-product of the change itself, and again as the chief end 
or aim of the process. At all events, heat is constantly 
being produced in the human body, and as energy in its 
simple form we may think of energy release as heat pro- 
duction. It has long been known that the production of 
heat in the body varied with many factors, but in recent 
years efforts have been directed to determine what is 
normal heat production, so that a standard would be 
available by which abnormalities could be judged. The 
heat production of an individual has been called its basal 
metabolism. The basal metabolism is controlled by the 
activity of the organs, muscles, and blood, and in part by 
body weight and body surface area. There is some rela- 
tionship between body weight and body area, but pro- 
toplasmic activity of body cells is more significant in ex- 
plaining basal metabolism. The heat produced by the 
body is an indication of the metabolic activity of the 
tissues. DuBois has shown that the basal metabolism of 
boys is 25 per cent, greater than that of adults. His figures 
follow :

This table shows that boys before adolescence have a 
high rate of metabolism, 1 that men have a higher rate 
than women, and that with advancing age the furnace 
fires cool down and oxidation is no longer so intense. 

Heat is lost from the body by conduction and radiation; 
by evaporation of water from lungs and skin; and by warm- 
ing the food ingested and the ah* breathed. The loss by 
conduction and radiation and by evaporation are the sig- 
nificant losses. Individuals inadequately clothed for cold 
weather require that the body burn its food at an increased 
rate to keep up its basal metabolism. The observation by 
Lavoisier on this point has been abundantly confirmed. 

Caloric Values of Different Articles of Food. When 
food is burned in the body heat is produced. The ability 
of the food to produce heat renders it valuable to the body, 
and hence food is measured in terms of its heat-producing 
power. This is called its caloric value, or its power to 
produce units of heat in the body. 

The caloric 2 value of food-stuffs has meant very little to 
most persons because the gram is usually chosen as the 
unit of measurement. Tables of common articles of diet 
giving the caloric value, protein, fat and carbohydrate 
values, in relation to well-known units of service, such as 
slice, teaspoonful, tablespoonful, etc., can be found in 
some of the technical books on dietetics. The most 
serviceable in this respect is "Feeding the Family," by 
Mary S. Rose. Another excellent little book is "Food 
Values," by Edwin Locke. 

Classification of Food. Foods vary widely in their 
chemical composition. They also vary, therefore, in the 
service they give to the animal economy. It has been 
customary to classify food in terms of the food elements 
in different varieties of food, but the newer knowledge of 

1 Lack of appreciation of the fact that children in the "growing 
years" have a high basal metabolism is the cause of much under- 
nutrition.

1 gram of fat yields 9 calories. 

1 gram of carbohydrate yields 4 calories. 



HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 159 

nutrition has emphasized certain food factors that are 
essential for maintenance and growth. A functional 
classification is to be preferred because of this fact, and 
also because of the hygienic implications involved. We 
shall discuss food, therefore, with respect to: 

1. Its power to yield energy. 

2. Its power to build tissue. 

3. Its power to regulate body processes. 

It should be noted that some examples of food combine 
all of these characteristics. Thus, milk and eggs possess 
the above powers. Good human milk alone is entirely 
adequate for infants. Many different foods are both 
yielders of energy and builders of tissue. Many possess 
the power to regulate body processes. Combinations are 
essential to secure the three values in the proper pro- 
portion. 

Food to Yield Energy. Foods contain three classes of 
chemical compounds known as carbohydrates, fats, and 
proteins. The first two are in daily life the main sources 
of energy. These compounds are widely distributed in 
food supplies. 1 Meats contain both fats and proteins; 
eggs have nearly equal amounts of fats and proteins; 
milk yields carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in almost 
equal amounts; most cereals contain all three and never 
less than two (fat insignificant in amount) ; most nuts are 
rich in protein and fat; and vegetables with few exceptions 
contain all three, with the carbohydrates in largest amount. 
The food-stuffs economical for energy are the carbohy- 
drates and fats. 

(a) Carbohydrates. The carbohydrates include the sim- 
ple sugars and the starches that by digestive processes are 
changed into sugars. After digestion the sugars are taken 

1 There are no special system foods. The nervous system is de- 
pendent upon the same food sources for its energy that supply the 
other systems of the body. The term "brain food" or "nerve food" 
is a misnomer. (See Fig. 17.) Sanatogen has been advertised ex- 
tensively as a "nerve food and tonic." It is not so regarded among 
scientific people. 



160 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

by the circulation to the liver, where they are stored in the 
form of glycogen. As sugar is needed in the body the 
supply in the liver is drawn upon, and thus in the hours 
between meals carbohydrate is always available for energy. 
The combustion of carbohydrates may follow one of 
several possible courses, but it leads eventually to carbon 
dioxid and water. The rate of combustion depends upon 
the activity of the body. Oxygen is necessary for this

combustion, and unless some unusual condition impede, 
the supply of oxygen will be maintained sufficient for body 
needs. If the carbohydrate is abundant, it may result in 
the saving of fat for the time, so that the fat of the diet 
will be stored in the body tissues. 

It is well known also that fat may be formed from carbo- 
hydrate. Numerous experiments have demonstrated this 
fact. The evidence of a practical kind is given by those 



HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 161 

people of overweight proportions who partake freely of 
carbohydrate foods, such as potatoes, candy, cereals, and 
bread. 

(b) Fats. The fats are widely distributed in nature and 
occur in both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. They 
are represented in milk, cream, butter, nuts, olive oil, and 
other vegetable oils. After digestion of food containing 
fats the end-products of the change pass into the circula- 
tion and thence into the tissues. They may be burned at 
once to produce energy, stored as glycogen for use as fuel 
at a later time, or bound in chemical combination to 
produce tissue fat. Some of the fat enters into combina- 
tion with proteins, phosphorus, and other substances to 
form complex compounds (e. g., lecithin) found especially 
in the nervous system. 

For the liberation of energy fat is burned and yields 
finally carbon dioxid and water. This energy production 
is high. While 1 gram of carbohydrate yields about 4 
calories, 1 gram of fat yields about 9. We recognize, 
therefore, that fat is a food of high fuel value and useful 
primarily as a source of energy. 

Food to Build Tissue. Proteins are of importance 
chiefly as tissue builders and are the only available source 
of nitrogen. They are found in animal and plant tissues. 
More complex in chemical structure than the carbohy- 
drates and fats, they have at last yielded to scientific 
methods, so that their terminal digestion units, called 
amino-acids, are well known. Not all proteins are alike 
in the amino-acids yielded, and the amino-acids them- 
selves vary greatly in their ability to build tissue. Osborn, 
McCollum, and others have shown that certain proteins 
obtained from wheat (gliadin), rye (gliadin), pea (legumin), 
barley (hordein), maize (zein), and kidney bean (phaseolin) 
may maintain life, but are not sufficient to promote growth. 
The growth proteins of value are from milk (casein), 
hemp seed (edestin), wheat (glutein), maize (glutelin), 
and squash seed (globulin). Such experiments would in- 
dicate the importance for growing children of milk, whole 
11 



162 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

wheat, and unprocessed corn, to mention the foods in the 
above group commonly used. 

The relative value of meat and vegetable proteins for 
growth and life processes in general has not been finally 
determined. Certain results have been secured by careful 
feeding experiments, but more remains to be done before 
a final statement can be made. The animal proteins, if 
milk and eggs are included, and of course they should be, 
are distinctly superior as sources of nitrogen for the body. 

The proteins of vegetables as they occur in the ordinary 
diet are not so easily digested and utilized as the meat 
proteins. For growth purposes McCollum 1 says: ' 'These 
(muscle tissue proteins) are distinctly better than those of 
the seeds with which investigations have been conducted." 
Sherman 2 notes: "Hoobler has shown that milk is the best 
form of food protein for the production of human milk and 
the protection of the body protein of the nursing mother." 

Protein is the only food containing nitrogen and nitrogen 
is essential for life. The body is continually using nitrogen 
in its metabolic activities, and the amount used can be 
determined by measuring the amount of nitrogen in the 
waste eliminated. If the nitrogen of the food and the 
nitrogen of body waste are determined, it is possible to 
compute the nitrogen intake and output. If the output 
exceeds the intake, it means that the body is burning its 
own protein to supply its needs. By reducing the intake 
to the minimum where output and intake balance we 
reach a point of equilibrium known in chemistry as 
"nitrogen equilibrium." It has been held that meat 
proteins were more usable in the body. Burton-Opitz 3 
states that, to secure nitrogen equilibrium, "we need 30 
grams of the proteins of meat, 31 grams of the proteins of 
milk, 54 grams of the proteins of beans, 76 grams of the 
proteins of bread, 102 grams of the proteins of corn." On

the other hand, Sherman 1 has shown recently that nitrogen 
equilibrium can be maintained on a diet of cereal grains 
of 35 to 45 grams of protein per man of 70 kilograms per 
day. "An allowance of 1 gram of protein per kilogram of 
body weight per day provides a margin of safety of from 
50 to 100 per cent, above the minimum actually required 
to maintain equilibrium." For palatability's sake meat 
protein is superior to vegetable protein, but for health's 
sake it is probably wise counsel to say that the protein 
allowance per day should not exceed 100 grams, and that 
meat in contributing to that maximum should not be used 
more often than once a day. 

The diet in Germany during the war failed miserably in 
maintaining health and was inadequate for work of 
physical or mental kind. Lusk 2 reports a table presented

"The exclusion of animal foods from the diet made it 
monotonous, and for many it was not better than the 
fare of prisoners sixty or seventy years before." More- 
over, as Lusk later says, "The mixed diet of peace time 
showed a loss of 10 per cent, of nitrogen, while the coarse 
vegetarian war diet showed that 20 or even 50 1 per cent, 
of the nitrogen of the diet could not be absorbed." 

The present evidence would seem to indicate the value 
of animal proteins for growing children. For adults, when 
growth is not important, the proteins must be judged not 
as to source, but as to composition. 

Composition of Vegetable and Animal Proteins. 
Although there is conflicting evidence and opinion as 
regards the relative value of animal and vegetable protein, 
there is general agreement that the sources differ markedly 
in composition. This difference lies chiefly in the amount 
of nucleoprotein available. This is of importance because 
nucleoprotein is the source of the purin bases, complex 
products of protein metabolism, and substances directly 
related to the production of gout and probably related to 
the efficiency and health of the kidneys. 

In writing of the purins Rose 2 says: "These purins are 
not nutritious, but are gradually transformed in the body 
to uric acid, to be carried off as waste in the urine. Persons 
inclined to gout have difficulty in getting rid of uric acid, and 
the more meat they eat, the more uric acid tends to accumu- 
late in the system, circulating in the blood and depositing 
in the joints. If protein is taken in moderation and chiefly 
from eggs, milk, cheese, bread, and nuts, which contain no 
purins, dangers of this difficulty may be avoided. . . . For 

1 This would apparently lower the protein intake below 16 grams. 
War diets in some areas of Germany under observation by American 
officers showed a total calorie yield of 1200 to 2000. This lowering 
of the protein intake and the caloric value of the diet was not in- 
compatible with life because the basal metabolism was probably 
reduced. But there was noticed a very great susceptibility to in- 
fections. Patients in hospitals and welfare institutions died in 
great numbers.

persons of indoor sedentary life a very liberal use of meat 
is certainly undesirable. Even athletes, for whom meat 
was once thought especially necessary, have demon- 
strated the possibility of reducing their daily consumption 
to one-sixth the amount which the training table pre- 
viously provided, with an actual increase in their capacity 
for endurance." 

The following foods are practically purin free: milk, 
eggs, cheese, sugars, breadstuffs made with white flour, 
fruits, nuts, rice, potatoes, all root vegetables, most green 
vegetables (spinach and asparagus excepted), fats, and 
oils. The foods of high purin are: sweetbreads, kidney, 
roe, liver, and sardines. Those fairly high in purin are: 
beef, veal, mutton, pork, chicken, turkey, goose and other 
game, fish (cod excepted), spinach, asparagus, peas, and 
beans. 

Food to Regulate Body Processes. Mendel and Osborn 1 
reported their results on feeding different proteins. They 
showed that rats require for normal growth certain of the 
17 ammo-acids which are the structural units of all pro- 
teins. Now, no matter what combination of foods they 
used, the animals failed to grow unless there were present 
in the diet two things: "one present in butter-fat and 
absent in lard; another present in milk, but which was not 
protein, fat, carbohydrate, or mineral. These x and y of 
Mendel's experiments were noted in papers published 
simultaneously with Funk's announcement of Vitamin in 
191 1." 2 McCollum, working along similar lines, gave the 
names "fat-soluble A" and "water-soluble B" to these 
substances. Lately a third substance has been discovered, 
water-soluble C. The three types are usually designated 
by physiologic chemists as vitamin A, B, and C. 

How Vitamins Affect Nutrition and Growth. Numerous 
experiments by Osborn, Mendel, Funk, Vedder, Takaki, 
McCollum, and his co-workers definitely prove that

Substances, Carnegie Institute, Washington, Publication No. 156.

166 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

nutrition and growth are profoundly affected by the 
vitamins of food. Not only do specific diseases develop if 
the vitamins are absent, but malnutrition of all grades 
occurs when the vitamins are not in sufficient amount. 
Scurvy and beriberi have lately been termed deficiency 
diseases because of being caused by a diet deficient in 
vitamin, C in the former and B in the latter. McCollum 1 
gives numerous illustrations of the damage done by a diet 
in which the vitamin element is deficient. Eddy 2 says 
that rickets which were formerly considered to be due to 
a lack of calcium salts has been stated by McCollum to be 
due to a deficiency of any two of four factors quality of 
protein, mineral salts, fat-soluble A, and water-soluble B. 
Marasmus has shown some evidence of connection with 
the A and B vitamins and scurvy has been linked with the 
C vitamin. It should be noted that while the vitamin 
content is extremely important in the diets of growing 
children, it is to be noted that adults will secure all the 
vitamin they require from the usual mixed diet. Ordinary 
fresh foods are the simplest, cheapest, and richest sources 
of vitamins. The commercialization of the interest in 
vitamins would lead persons to believe that vitamin 
tablets, yeast, and other preparations are essential to 
health.

Destruction of Vitamins. Since most foods reach the 
table changed in form from that of their natural state, 
either through cooking, canning, pasteurization, or other 



HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 169 

chemical or physical method, it is important to know to 
what extent vitamin is changed or lost by such procedures. 

The Story of Vitamin A. The "A" vitamin is affected 
as follows: Eddy 1 says, "Heat alone is of very limited 
effect, but where sources are heated in the presence of 
oxygen, destruction of the vitamin may be very rapid. 
. . . Cooking of vegetables will not, as a rule, result in 
appreciable destruction of this factor. . . . The many 
lard substitutes now in use must in general be considered 
'A 1 vitamin free regardless of the content of the 'A' in the 
fats from which they are derived, unless they have been 
made by blending instead of hydrogenation." 

The question of heating the vitamin has not been 
settled because the factors vary markedly. Sherman, 
MacLeod, and Kramer state that "dry heating at a tem- 
perature of 100 C. with free access of air only very slowly 
destroyed fat-soluble vitamin." They go on to say : "The 
results thus far obtained emphasize the importance of 
taking full account of the time as well as the temperature 
of heating, and of the initial concentration of vitamin in 
the food as well as the opportunity for previous storage of 
the vitamin by the test animal." 

The Story of Vitamin B. The vitamin B will not be 
appreciably affected in ordinary cooking temperatures if 
alkali is not used. Therefore, the canning or preserving 
of food by the addition of bicarbonate of soda at the time 
of preparation is detrimental to the B vitamin. The use 
of soda in the cooking of vegetables "to soften the vegetable 
and accelerate the cooking" is destructive of vitamin B. 

The Story of Vitamin C. The C vitamin is more sen- 
sititve than A or B. "Temperatures above 50 C.," says 
Eddy, 2 "are usually destructive, although the time factor 
is extremely important as well as the reaction. Hess, for 
example, has found that the temperature used to pas- 
teurize milk continued for some time is more destructive 

1 Eddy, W. H.: The Vitamin Manual, Williams & Wilkins Co., 
Baltimore, 1921, pp. 63, 64. 
2 Ibid., p. 68. 



170 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

to vitamin than boiling water temperature continued for 
only a few minutes. The extent to which orange juice and 
tomato juice resist high temperatures indicates the pro- 
tective action of acids to be considerable. " 

The cooking of cabbage destroys about 90 per cent, of 
its vitamin C. If acid or alkali is added to vegetables in 
cooking, most of the vitamin is lost. 

Dehydration of vegetables destroys, in most instances, 
the C vitamin. Hess 1 suggests that dehydration was "the 
greatest cause of scurvy in the Central Empires' ' during 
the World War. 

Young fresh vegetables contain more C vitamin than 
old ones. These considerations all indicate the need for 
man to secure fresh natural food products so far as possi- 
ble; to avoid those that have been treated chemically and 
in other ways. As regards milk, it is unquestionably 
better to use pasteurized milk in which the vitamin A has 
been decreased and to make up this deficiency in other 
foods, than to court tuberculosis and dysentery by the 
use of raw milk. It is probably Utopian to ever expect 
that city children may receive, generally, clean raw milk. 
The care of milch cows and the gathering of milk present 
openings in our public health armor that are best cared for 
by pasteurization. 

Mineral Salts as a Dietary Essential. The mineral 
salts occupy a very important place in the dietary. They 
are not burned to produce heat, but they do help to build 
tissue and in regulating body processes. They are to be 
considered as a constituent of food of prime importance. 
Thus Sherman, 2 in speaking of ' 'mineral metabolism" and 
the functions of salts, says that they serve in three ways: 

"(1) As bone constituents, giving rigidity and relative perma- 
nence to the skeletal tissues. 

"(2) As essential elements of the organic compounds which are 
the chief solid constituents of the soft tissues (muscles, 
blood-cells, etc.).

"(3) As soluble salts (electrolytes) held in solution in the fluids 
of the body, giving these fluids their characteristic influ- 
ence upon the elasticity and irritability of muscle and 
nerve, supplying the material for the acidity or alkilinity 
of the digestive juices and other secretions, and yet main- 
taining the neutrality or slight alkalescence of the internal 
fluids as well as their osmotic pressure and solvent power."

body as follows:

The Role of Mineral Salts in Food. The presence or 
absence of salts essential to body metabolism is an im- 
portant matter. The correct understanding of the possi- 
bility of foods supplying these essentials will help to cor- 
rect the rather prevalent notion that these valuable in- 
gredients are only to be secured by taking "patent med- 
icines," extravagantly advertised and claiming unwar- 
ranted values. 

Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are always found in the 
three food-stuffs, so that these elements are abundant. 
Available nitrogen is found only in protein, and this ex- 
plains why health cannot be maintained on a diet of only 
carbohydrates and fats. 

Sodium, potassium, and magnesium are supplied in 
sufficient amounts in food without any care in the selection 
for this purpose. The amount of sodium chlorid added to 
1 Sherman, H. C. : Loc. cit., p. 234. 



172 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

food is much more than sufficient for the body needs; 
potassium and magnesium are fairly abundant in meat 
(muscle) and in vegetables, so that an ordinary mixed 
diet with some roughage will contain sufficient amounts 
of these substances. Calcium, relatively large in the salt 
content of the body, is quite irregularly distributed among 
staple food articles. Milk, however, contains it in abun- 
dance, and if sufficient milk is used this element will be 
provided adequately. The calcium needs of the body 
must be provided, especially hi infancy and childhood and 
during pregnancy. Lusk 1 emphasizes the importance of 
calcium during pregnancy, especially during the last ten 
weeks. Sherman, 2 in speaking of the requirements, says, 
". . . It would seem that the food of a family should 
furnish at least 0.67 gram of calcium or 0.9 to 1.0 gram 
of calcium oxid per man per day." And later he 3 says, 
"Apparently the American dietary is more often deficient 
in calcium than in any other element; certainly more 
attention should be paid to the choice of such foods as will 
increase the calcium content of the dietary. The use of 
more milk and vegetables with less meat and sugar will 
accomplish this and usually improve the diet in other 
directions as well." It is important at this point to re- 
member that McCollum says that milk and leaf vegetables 
will correct the dietary deficiencies of other foods in re- 
spect to vitamins. The importance of milk as an article of 
food is seen to be very great. The most practical means of 
securing an adequate calcium supply is to use milk freely. 
It is important to note that the "milling" of grain re- 
moves a large amount of calcium. White flour, polished 
rice, and new process cornmeal are very poor in calcium. 
The fruits and vegetables are quite rich in calcium, es- 
pecially prunes, oranges, carrots, and cabbage. The 
sulphur content will be adequately provided if the protein 
supply is sufficient. The sulphur needs are about 1 gram

HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 173 

per day, and if about 100 grams of protein are used ade- 
quate sulphur will be secured. 

On the other hand, phosphorus may not be found in 
sufficient amount in dietaries, and since, like calcium, it 
represents an important part of the body structure, there 
should be care to avoid a deficiency. Phosphorus is 
present in the human body chiefly in bones, milk, brain, 
nerve, and sexual tissue, and is essential in all body cells. 
The phosphorus requirement is given by Sherman 1 as 
"1.44 grams (3.30 grams P205) corresponding to a 'protein 
standard' of 75 grams." The evidence from many sources 2 
indicates that organic phosphorus compounds are of no 
more value as food than are the inorganic phosphates. 
This evidence is significant because of its bearing upon the 
blatant claim of manufacturers who offer organic phos- 
phates in patent medicines as "tonics, restorers, and 
strengthened. ' ' Food should be chosen that would provide 
this necessary element. (See Table IV. 2 ) 

White flour is very poor as a source of phosphorus be- 
cause milling has removed the salt which is deposited in 
the outer shell of the kernel. 

The significance of an adequate phosphorus content of 
the blood is very great in children and especially in the 
first years of life. Occurrence of a depleted phosphorus 
content in the blood of a young child almost always means 
rickets. 3 The phosphorus content of our food supply 
should not be treated lightly. The teaching of health 
workers everywhere in educating parents to the full 
meaning of proper food for the baby and growing child is 
being constantly revised. It will be increasingly important

Table IV, modified from Rose, 1 gives the amount of 
calcium and phosphorus in 100-calorie portions of some 
common food materials. 

The iron content of the human body is small, but its 
importance is very great. The loss of iron from the blood 
results in a condition known as anemia, also chlorosis. 
Sherman sets 2 as the desirable standard "15 milligrams of 
food iron per man per day." Woman during pregnancy 
and at the menstrual period would require more, perhaps 
about 18 milligrams. Table V, from Rose, 3 gives the 
iron content in grams of food rich in iron:

Sherman sets 15 milligrams of food iron per day as a 
minimum. The above portions give the iron content in 
grams. Fifteen milligrams expressed in grams would be 
0.015 gram. It follows, therefore, that the minimum would 
be satisfied by providing adequate portions of the above. 

In order to supply sufficient iron foods should be selected 
with some consideration of the amounts of iron present. 
Iron is especially available in meat, milk, eggs, whole 
wheat flour, spinach, and beans. A diet containing green 
vegetables liberally, whole wheat bread, fruits, and some 
meat will supply sufficient iron. 

"Does man need medicinal iron?" has often been asked. 
Numerous laboratory experiments extending since 1854 
provides today the opinion that food will provide all that 
is needed of iron compounds for the body. It has been 
claimed that in anemia inorganic iron may act as a stim- 
ulus to the body, but recent experiments by Whipple and 
Robscheit 1 do not indicate any such effects. The best 
medical opinion holds that hemoglobin (the iron compound 
of the blood) is derived from the organic iron compounds 
of the food. The justification for patent medicine prepara- 
tions of iron is lacking; intelligent and rational procedure 
in anemia and chlorosis 2 would be to provide adequate 
iron in the diet, to secure outdoor exercise, and remove 
any of the causes favoring the disease. The eating of 
highly "milled" flours and predigested and refined food 
substances does not make for adequate iron metabolism 
in the body. 

A recent addition to the "eat more" campaigns heralds 
the value of raisins as purveyors of iron. It may be seri- 
ously questioned if one should eat large amounts of raisins 
because of the large amount of indigestible material they 
contain. The claim for iron content is an exceedingly 
brave one in view of the data in Table V. (See also Fig. 

Chippie, G. H., and Robscheit, F. S.: Iron and Arsenic as In- 
fluencing Blood Regeneration, etc., Archives of Internal Medicine, 
May, 1921, vol. 27, p. 591. 

2 There is some evidence that medicinal iron is useful in chlorosis. 
But even here the management is more important than the medicine. 



HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 177 

18.) Thus lj figs give as much and one medium-sized 
potato gives more iron than J cup of raisins. For health 
purposes 2J cups of milk or a half-dozen prunes would be 
more desirable than raisins, no matter how attractive the 
box in which they were sold.

The Mineral Salts and Body Reaction. The blood and 
body fluids show alkaline to litmus, but the hydroxyl ions 
are not appreciably in excess of the hydrogen ions, and 
for practical purposes they may be called neutral. The 
normal metabolic changes in growth and action produce 
axjids which must be neutralized in order to keep the blood 
12 



178 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

and body fluids in the proper condition. The source of 
the power to develop neutrality lies in the food of the diet 
and especially in the carbonates, phosphates, ammonia, 
and proteins. Sherman, 1 in speaking of the experiments of 
Blatherwick, says, "... foods which have a preponder- 
ance of base-forming elements lead to the formation of a 
urine which is less acid, both as regards hydrogen ion 
concentration and titration acidity, while t^e ammonia 
content of the urine is diminished and the carbon dioxid 
tension of the alveolar air, indicative of reserve alkalinity, 
is increased." 

The foods containing base-forming elements are chiefly 
milk, vegetables, and fruits. It has been previously noted 
that these foods are also valuable, especially for their 
salts of calcium and iron, and for their vitamins. 

The Hygiene of Nutrition. By voluntary act it is 
quite impossible to control intestinal peristalsis, to direct 
the flow of bile, or to favor the absorption of digested food 
elements from the alimentary canal. The hygiene of 
nutrition, however, is not dependent upon such control. 
All that is essential in the nourishment of the body and in 
the economy of processes relates to factors that are con- 
trollable. They may be stated to be: to choose food 
wisely; to eat correctly, and to evacuate regularly. 

Wise Choice of Food. Choosing food wisely involves a 
knowledge of the functions of food, its power to build 
tissue, to yield energy, and to regulate body processes. 
In addition, food values in terms of calories and with 
reference to man's needs, food digestibility, and food 
poisons are important matters to consider in the choice of 
food. The functions of food have been presented. There 
remain the caloric values and the body's need, food digesti- 
bility, and idiosyncrasies of people toward different foods. 

(a) Food Values and Body Needs. Lusk 2 says, "One 
can say that in the United States there is no protein, or 

Sherman, H. C.: Loc. cit., p. 281.

179 



salt, or vitamin deficiency in the habitual diet, and there 
is plenty of roughage in the form of cabbage, sauerkraut, 
and other vegetable foods available to him who desires it." 
Sherman, 1 however, in analyzing 150 American dietaries, 
says with reference to the iron content, "Apparently, 
therefore, the typical American dietary does not contain 
any such surplus of iron as would justify the practice of 
leaving the supply of this element entirely to chance." 

Experts differ on these points. The rational procedure 
in such a situation is for the individual with adequate 
knowledge to make sure that the best available is selected. 
This means frequently not eating more food, but choosing 
wisely less food. For although the past tendency has been 
to set standards for diets, it should be noted that it is 
quite impossible to plan a single diet that will be adequate 
for all. At best certain principles may be stated : 

The protein and energy factors of the diet should be 
modified in accordance with the needs of the organism as 
regards growth, work, and body weight. Thus Atwater 2 
recommends: 



Standards for 


Protein, 
grama. 


Fuel values, 
calories.

While European experts place the protein requirement 
higher, the tendency of chemists in America has been to 
constantly set a lower standard. Chittenden 3 in particular 
has set the standard much lower, and holds that 50 grams 
a day is sufficient for body needs. From a survey of 

1 Sherman, H. C.: Loc. cit., p. 303.

180 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

numerous experiments Sherman 1 reports, "the apparent 
protein requirements as indicated by the data of individual 
experiments ranges between the extremes of 20 and 79.2 
grams, averaging 49.2 grams of protein per man of 70 
kilograms per day. Thus the average falls well within the 
range of Chittenden's estimate" (see Lusk's report on 
German diets, p. 163). Sherman 2 found that nitrogen 
equilibrium was maintained with protein of 35 to 45 grams 
from cereal grains. Providing a margin of safety, 70 to 
80 grams of protein would seem adequate. 

The energy requirements are related to the work of the 
body. To maintain the body weight the fuel value of the 
food must be sufficient for the needs of the body. If fat 
is deposited, more fuel has been taken in than can be 
burned ; hence the excess is stored. Fuel value of children's 
dietaries should always be liberal to provide for great 
muscular activity and marked growth. Sherman 3 gives 
the energy requirements of different ages as follows: 

Under 1 year 45 calories per pound (about 900 calories) 

1- 2 years 45-40 calories per pound (about 1000-1100 calories)

The above figures indicate that during the period of 
growth a great increase in fuel is necessary; that a young 
person, fourteen to seventeen years, may need more fuel 
than one thirty years of age; and that as age increases the 
fuel requirement decreases. Age is not a valuable in- 
dication alone. Work done with reference to age is the 
best guide. The "man of the house" living a sedentary

life may require less than the young boy only twelve years 
of age. 

It will thus be seen that while it is possible to calculate 
from tables the caloric value of the diet for different in- 
dividuals, it is unsafe to set absolute standards. In addi- 
tion to caloric needs the child should correspond in weight 
with the members of the age-height group in which he 
falls; the adult needs to adjust diet to weight and also 
to work. The danger of the child being malnourished and 
of the adult being too well nourished is so important that 
tables (Table VI) are given to indicate what the weight 
should be for different individuals. 

(b) Food Digestibility. It is not possible to be guided in 
the choice of food only by the caloric yield any more than 
by its salt or vitamin content. All the factors are im- 
portant. Thus certain foods are easy and others difficult 
to digest; while for some persons foods may be entirely 
unsuited, and to others entirely unwholesome. This 
problem of feeding the human being is one that requires 
care, attention, and reasonable intelligence. 

The digestibility of foods has been expressed in terms of 
coefficients of digestibility, by which is indicated the per- 
centage of the food available for men as determined by 
the relation between the constituents of the food con- 
sumed and the corresponding constituent of the waste 
material from the alimentary tract. Atwater has com- 
puted the coefficients of digestibility of the main classes of 
food on a simple mixed diet as follows:

184 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

Digestibility of food should not be confused with ease 
of digestion nor rapidity of digestion. Food that stays a 
long time in the stomach is said to be difficult of digestion, 
but this refers only to rate of digestion and not to the 
yield of the food elements finally. There seems to be 
little relation between ease or rapidity of digestion and 
the percentage or coefficient of digestibility of food. There 
is a difference, however, in foods as regards the length of 
time given to gastric digestion. Sherman 1 states the 
following concerning the movement of food materials 
through the stomach: 

"Ordinarily, when each is fed separately, protein food 
stays longer in the stomach than carbohydrate, fat longer 
than protein, and mixtures of fat and protein leave the 
stomach more slowly than either alone. This is probably 
because fat tends to retard both the motility of the stomach 
and the secretion of the acid gastric juice. In general, the 
softer or more fluid the fat, the more rapidly it will leave 
the stomach; also emulsified fats tend to pass on more 
promptly than fat of the same kind taken in larger masses." 

Hawk 2 and his associates have conducted a series of ex- 
periments on gastric digestion. Some of the conclusions of 
this work are given below: 

Whole boiled, creamed, mashed (with and without milk 
and butter), baked (with and without butter), potato 
salad, French, German and plain fried potatoes, and 
potato chips "left the stomach in moderate time or one 
and a half to two and a half hours for rapid type individuals 
and two to three and a half hours for the slow type. 
Fried potatoes left the stomach as rapidly as potatoes 
prepared in other ways. Sweet potatoes remained longer 
in the stomach than white potatoes cooked in the same 
ways." 

Pickled red beets left the stomach more rapidly than

boiled red beets, although the latter left in one to two 
hours. Carrots, parsnips, and turnips, boiled, left the 
stomach in one and a half to three hours. 

"In general, raw vegetables low in protein, as carrots, 
celery, tomatoes, cabbage, lettuce, and cucumber, leave 
the stomach rapidly and without great change." 
* In studying the effect of water, tea, coffee, and cocoa 
upon digestion in the stomach the following conclusions 
were made by Hawk 1 and his associates: 

"Evacuation of the stomach was not appreciably de- 
layed by the drinking of 1 liter of cold water, cold or hot 
tea, hot coffee, either plain, with cream, or cream and 
sugar. The addition of sugar alone to coffee delayed 
evacuation. 

"Cocoa in 1 liter quantities markedly delayed evacu- 
ation." 

Results from the study 2 of candies show: "Candies 
depress secretion and delay evacuation in proportion to 
their sugar content and the amount of them ingested. 
This tendency is influenced, however, by flavoring sub- 
stances, and particularly by added food ingredients, such 
as milk, eggs, or chocolate, which stimulate gastric se- 
cretion. "Candies should be eaten not before but after 
meals. Hard candies which must be sucked are prefer- 
able to cream candies for children." 

A study of the digestion in the stomach of puddings, 
pies, and cakes gives an average time for puddings of two 
hours; pies, two hours and twenty-four minutes; cakes, 
three hours. Pies were digested more rapidly than cakes. 
"The addition of 50 grams of ice-cream to a small piece of 
pie did not increase the burden of the stomach to any 
marked extent."

wholesome becomes for some persons a distinct poison. 
That means that those persons have an idiosyncrasy for 
that particular food. Many people develop fads and fears 
as regards certain foods, but a real food idiosyncrasy may 
exist. Such reaction to food is called sensitization. 
Sensitization to certain proteins is the most usual form 
observed. 

It is not so easy to explain the way in which sensitiza- 
tion to food occurs, but the fact of being sensitive is well 
known. 1 Supposedly, the child is given too much of a 
new food, which he has not as yet developed a capacity 
to handle. There results a susceptibility which renders 
the individual unable to care for that kind of food sub- 
sequently. The phenomenon of sensitization is also 
known to exist in certain disturbances of the respiratory 
tract, e. g., certain forms of hay-fever are known to be 
related to definite flower or vegetable proteins. 

In medicine it is known that foreign proteins injected 
into the blood may render the individual very sensitive 
to the particular protein injected. This sometimes occurs 
in the administration of antitoxin. 

Correct Eating. The eating of food has become today 
a complex matter. It is not sufficient to provide for 
proper energy needs, vitamins, and salts; to eat in such 
fashion that digestion will be as thorough, rapid, and 
orderly as possible is very desirable. It is, therefore, im- 
portant to note those conditions that are associated with 
the hygiene of eating. 
1. Environment. 

The quiet, clean, attractive dining place is a boon 
to good eating. To avoid noisy, dirty places should 
be the first thought in selecting a place to eat. The 
dining-room should tend to produce repose, quiet, 
freedom from hurry and rush. It is an expression of 
an overwrought nervous system to desire an eating 
place where the din of jazz rhythms vies with the 

1 Longcope, W. T. : Protein Hypersensitiveness, Journal American 
Medical Association, November 12, 1921, p. 1535. 



HYGIENE OP NUTRITION 187 

screeching voices to be heard above the rattle and 
crashing of dishes and cabaret singers. Digestion is 
aided by an atmosphere of quiet and calm. 

In a study of the psychic influences on digestion of 
food, Hawk 1 and his associates found as follows: 
' 'Mixed meals consisting of nourishing ingredients, 
but very unpleasantly prepared and served, gave 
rise in the case of a phlegmatic individual to no 
distinct delay, ... a more susceptible individual 
showed a slight delay. 

"Chinese preserved eggs, unpalatable to our sub- 
jects in appearance, odor, taste, and belief in their 
unwholesome character led to delayed acid response 
and evacuation." 

2. Condition of the individual. 

One should come to the table rested. If fatiguing 
work has been performed before mealtime, the 
hygienic plan would provide a period of rest before 
eating. 

Moreover, the mind and spirits of the individual 
should be cheerful and happy. Hawk reports that 
anxiety and mental strain markedly delay gastric 
digestion. The importance of avoiding emotional 
states associated with worry is nowhere more pro- 
nounced than in connection with this subject. If de- 
pressing emotional conditions do control, it is best not 
to eat at that time. One should replace such states 
with a brave, cheerful attitude and the digestive 
tract will be ready to do its work. Nervous in- 
digestion is a sympton of bad mental hygiene. 

3. The technic of eating. 

If one comes to a dining-room that is quiet and 
attractive, and is himself free from fatigue and from 
depressing emotional states, one might eat almost 
any food in usual amounts, either rapidly or slowly, 

1 Hawk, P. B.. and associates: Gastric Response to Foods, 
American Journal of Physiology, vol. 52, No. 1, May, 1920, pp. 



18S PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

without experiencing any difficulty in digestion. All 
may not be so indiscreet, however. Nor is it wise 
for any one to so indulge his gastronomic instincts. 
Reason must guide here. The secret in eating then, 
is: 

1. To eat slowly. It has been claimed that we should 

chew each morsel of food thirty times. It is 
surely a waste of energy to count our jaw move- 
ments and unwise to concentrate our attention 
too much on the process of eating. Food should 
be enjoyed. The environment free from rush 
and hurry will help us automatically to chew 
food more to eat slowly. 

2. Not to wash food down the esophagus with drink. 

If the food is well chewed this will not be neces- 
sary. It is not unhygienic to drink water at 
mealtimes if no food is in the mouth at the 
tune of drinking. Ice-water should not be 
used. Milk that is cold should be drunk very 
slowly. 

Hawk found that cold water did not appreci- 
ably delay digestion if taken during the meal. 
The practice of drinking cold water at the be- 
ginning is to be condemned. Many people 
coming to the table hungry and thirsty commit 
a hygienic sin here. The blood-vessels of the 
stomach are dilated and the blood-supply is 
abundant; the gastric glands are exceedingly 
active in preparation for the food about to be 
eaten when suddenly a dash of cold water is 
thrown into the stomach, constricting the 
vessels and checking secretion. One should 
always eat some warm food before drinking 
cold water at meals. 

3. Do not overeat. To stop before completely satis- 

fied is good dietary advice. This means often 
foregoing the attractive dessert, or omitting the 
second helping of the favorite dish. A good 



HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 189 

plan is to take very small helpings. Eating 
slowly will help to eat less; one is satisfied with 
less when that taken is chewed thoroughly. 
Regular Evacuation. The hygiene of nutrition has been 
grouped around the wise choice of food, correct eating, 
and regular evacuation of the bowels, because all these 
factors are closely related. The best food correctly eaten 
will not nourish if waste material is not removed. Here 
is indicated the essential interdependence between all 
parts of the body. No one part can live to itself alone. 
All must function properly. Loss of efficiency in one 
part affects all. More will be said upon this subject in 
Chapter X; it is enough at this time to indicate its im- 
portance and connection. 

Causes of Indigestion. Frequently indigestion occurs 
because food is improperly cooked, but, as indicated 
above, there are other factors. These may be grouped 
together as the causes of indigestion : 

1. Improper foods. This may refer to the choice of the 

food or to the combination chosen. 

2. Improper cooking of the food. Food to be cooked 

should be cooked thoroughly, especially vegetables, 
breads, and pastries. 

3. Food idiosyncrasies. Examples are oysters, shell- 

fish, fish, buckwheat cakes, strawberries, and 
chocolate. 

4. Physical fatigue. If tired, one should rest before 

eating or eat very lightly (better not eat at all). 

5. Worry and depressing emotional states. 

6. Rapid eating. Important to avoid places that are 

noisy. Freedom from a sense of hurry is essential 
to correct eating. 

7. Drinking cold water before eating warm food at 

mealtime. 

8. Overeating. Large amounts of food may affect only 

slightly the coefficient of digestibility, but they do 
retard the ease and rapidity of digestion. Snyder 
found, however, that protein was 7 per cent, and 



190 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

fat 6 per cent, more completely absorbed in 
medium amounts of oatmeal and milk when he 
compared medium and large amounts of this 
ration. 

9. Constipation. Lack of evacuation of the bowels is 
frequently a cause of improper digestion of food. 

10. Defective teeth. This cause may act by not per- 

mitting thorough mastication; it also may be 
effective through the disturbance of the condition 
of the stomach due to the presence of pus material 
from the teeth. 1 

11. Various diseases. Indigestion may be a sign of ap- 

pendicitis. When the indigestion is prolonged it 
may be a sign of gastric ulcer, and in an elderly 
person, of cancer of the stomach. 
Fads and Fallacies in Diet. The individual who chooses 
food thoughtfully and on a logical plan needs all the facts 
available. Most food fads represent partial truths. They 
are so usual and commonplace that to account for their 
occurrence would be to write the story of human super- 
stition. Several of the most common will be discussed. 

Vegetarianism. At times extremists of this fad take a 
position of protest against the eating of animal flesh 
because of a philosophy that is opposed to the taking of 
animal life. In this position they may be accused of 
sentimentalism or what you will, but essentially the one 
defect of these people on this question is that they are not 
intellectually honest. If honest they would have to live 
upon air alone. They are entirely willing to eat plants 
which have life. If their philosophic and biologic educa- 
tion were as comprehensive as their sophistry they would 
appreciate the common origin of plant and animal life, 
and the essential integrity of the I'elan vital of Bergson, in 
both animals and plants. However, they must live, and 
since they are not philosophic, nor intellectually honest, 

1 It has not been determined whether the gastric disturbance 
results from the swallowing of pus or from infection through the 
circulation, or from both. 



HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 191 

they continue to choose eggs, milk, and cheese to supple- 
ment their vegetarian diet of nuts, cereals, and vegetables. 

Those who take the vegetarian r61e because of a belief 
in the superior value of a non-meat diet have many argu- 
ments that are interesting and worth investigating. Some 
members of this group object to eating lamb, beef, or 
pork because they believe that such foods are not whole- 
some. Some say that all animals are diseased, that many 
sick animals are killed for food, that serious disease often 
follows eating animal food. These are partial statements 
and are untrue. Some flesh is unwholesome (e. g., trichinosis 
is a serious disease at times) ; meat inspection should rule 
out the killing of sick animals just as it should eliminate 
rotten fruit and vegetables from the markets. In general, 
it is effective. 

The question of the relative superiority of animal or 
vegetable protein needs scientific information. The follow- 
ing facts have been established by investigators and ex- 
perience: 

1. The protein of animal food is more completely util- 

ized by the body than the protein of fruits, vege- 
tables, dried legumes, cereals, or breadstuffs. The 
coefficient of digestibility for animal food is 97 
per cent.; for the vegetarian group it varies from 
78 to 85 per cent. This difference is 12 to 19 per 
cent. If one requires 100 grams of protein daily, 
it is necessary to eat from 112 to 119 grams of 
vegetarian protein to secure the same amount 
that is available from 100 grams of animal food. 

2. The body needs animal protein. This may be largely 

supplied from milk and eggs. 

3. The superior palatability of meat proteins is generally 

recognized. 

4. Racial superiority may be definitely related to food 

habits. It may be suggested that this has some 
influence in the development to dominant positions 
in the world of those races that are meat eating 
as contrasted with the vegetarian groups. Sher- 



192 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

man, however, refers to these races as "not meat- 
eating but cow-keeping races." 

5. It should be noted, however, that it is a mistake to 

eat too much meat. The limit is to be placed at 
"meat once a day only." Excessive eating of 
meat leaves a waste of protein that is not only 
economically bad but also undesirable because of 
the strain upon kidneys 1 which must remove the 
end-products of protein metabolism. The purins 
are more abundant in meat. 

6. Pork is the least desirable of all meat. It is difficult 

to digest. It should always be thoroughly cooked 
to kill the trichina, if perchance the parasite is 
present. Beef is valuable for its iron content as 
well as protein. Lamb is tasty and easily digested. 
Fowl and fish are very desirable forms of flesh 
food. Lobster and scallops are quite difficult to 
digest because of the toughness of the muscle. 
There are probably few strict vegetarians. In reality, 
those who pose as such are "no meat" advocates. They 
eat animal foods, such as milk, cheese, and butter; other- 
wise they could not stay well. 

Hot Water Fad. This fad is especially vicious. Hot 
water before breakfast is helpful as a therapeutic measure 
for some persons, but its general use for all is not in- 
dicated. The ease with which people accept vague but 
rather plausible proposals for water therapy speaks 
vehemently of the sort of instruction given in physiology 
in the schools. Internal bathing by a patented cascade, 
hot water before meals, "water internally, externally, and 
eternally" these are but catch phrases of a fad that is 
unscientific and pernicious. 

Raw Food Fad. The raw food fad has some justifica- 
tion in proportion as it represents a reaction against bad 
cooking. Improperly cooked vegetables are more difficult 

1 Recent evidence of the influence of high protein diet on kidney 
irritation is given by Squier, T. L., and Newburgh, L. H.: Renal 
Irritation in Man from High Protein Diet, Archives of Internal 
Medicine, July, 1921. 



HYGIENE OF NUTRITION 193 

to digest than raw vegetables because the stomach will 
attempt to digest the former, but ignores and passes on 
the latter. As a fad it is without scientific basis. 

It has been generally held that fried foods are difficult 
to digest, but Hawk found no appreciable difference in 
time for digestion of fried potatoes as compared with 
potatoes cooked in other ways. In general, fat stays a 
long time in the stomach. If the food is fried in deep fat 
or prevented by other methods from taking up much fat, 
fried food is just as wholesome as other kinds. 

There is a real health danger, especially from typhoid 
fever, in eating certain uncooked foods (e. g., lettuce, 
celery, and water-cress) that have been grown in soil 
contaminated with sewage. Such uncooked food should 
be washed carefully in many changes of water, because 
the source is not usually known. 

No-breakfast Fad. It is not uncommon to find young 
people, especially girls, developing the no-breakfast fad. 
It should be stated that the body needs food in the morn- 
ing to draw on for energy used in the day's activities. 
The body needs are often cared for by these individuals in 
two large meals. This is unwholesome, and it is more 
desirable to distribute food eaten over three meals rather 
than two. These individuals often show an aversion to 
milk and eggs. It should be remembered that they may 
like custards, creamed soups, oyster milk stews, eggnogs, 
and other food dishes in which milk and eggs are used. 
An egg is an egg, whether in a custard or in the chicken 
house; it will serve the nutritive needs of the body, so far 
as we know, as well in custard form as it will when boiled, 
or poached, or scrambled. The same can be said for milk. 

Sour Milk Fad. The use of sour milk as a food was very 
popular some years ago due to the values assigned by 
Metchnikoff 1 to the change of the bacterial flora of the 
intestine produced by sour milk. This procedure has been 
very useful in the treatment of certain cases of intestinal

Soas, New York, 1908.

194 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

intoxication, but as a guide for the normal person it offers 
nothing. Sour milk as a food is useful because it has the 
same constituents as sweet milk. 

Food Adulteration. Before the passage of the Pure 
Food and Drug Act about 50 per cent, of the food sold in 
the United States was adulterated. The act defines 
adulteration to be: 

1. If any substance has been packed or mixed with it to 

reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or 
strength. 

2. If any substance has been substituted wholly or in 

part for the article. 

3. If any valuable constituent of the article has been 

wholly or in part abstracted. 

4. If it is mixed, colored, powdered, coated, or stained in 

any manner whereby damage or inferiority is con- 
cealed. 

5. If it contains any poisonous or other added dele- 

terious ingredient which may render such article 
injurious to health. 

6. If it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decom- 

posed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance or 
any portion of an animal unfit for food, whether 
manufactured or not, or if it is the product of a 
diseased animal or one that has died otherwise 
than by slaughter. 

The purpose of this act in terms of the definition of 
adulteration is to protect the public in two ways: 

1. To insure the delivery of the article labeled. Thus, 

an article labeled honey should contain honey and 
not glucose, a common adulterant. 

2. To prevent the use of deleterious substances. Thus, 

it is important that bacteria or parasites be absent 
and that injurious drugs have not been used to 
cover up decomposition. 
It is important to note the purpose of this act and help 

in carrying out its provisions. Two points should be kept 

in mind :

1. Labels are frequently used which enable the manu- 
facturer to be within the law, although in spirit he 
is frankly violating it.

(6) Jellies, jams, and catsups are frequently

usually glucose; for the last, benzoate of

2. It is not necessary to use chemicals to preserve or can 
fresh wholesome food. Food, therefore, that has 
been treated, indicates that the food was not in a 
fresh state. We do not know whether the minute 
amount of the chemical used is injurious or not, 
but we do know that food in need of a preservative 
is not wholesome food.

Alcohol, a distinct protoplasmic poison, has been de- 
fended in recent years because of its food value. There is 
little educational propaganda today on the food or health 
values of alcohol such were shattered long ago. The 
advocates of the use of alcohol have based their claims 
not on scientific truths, but rather on political "rights." 
Personal liberty has been invoked as the shibboleth of 
bootleggers, brewers, distillers, and all those who make 
money out of the trade. The old selfish reasons are again 
presented, whereas the Prohibition amendment was passed 
not to save man from himself , but to protect society. In 
the same way and after the same fashion that cocain, 



198 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

opium, morphin, and other narcotics are controlled, so 
alcohol has capitulated to an ideal of social responsibility. 
This ideal is to be kept alive and intelligent by constant 
contact with the scientific facts, so that it may always be 
an intelligent idealism. To present these facts, even in 
condensed form, is important. 

Alcohol and Length of Life. Evidence from insurance 
and benevolent associations accumulates to the effect that 
the steady use of alcohol increases mortality. This is true 
for even moderate users. The "light wines and beer" 
advocates are without scientific and statistical evidence to 
support their plea of "harmlessness." Steady but mod- 
erate drinkers show a group mortality of 86 per cent, in 
excess of the average. 1 

Alcohol and Efficiency. Experimental evidence of 
scientific and acceptable kinds shows that alcohol tem- 
porarily impairs memory, temporarily decreases the 
efficiency of workers, and resistance to disease. It has 
marked effect on bodily functions. This is especially to 
be noted in the circulatory and nervous systems. It 
increases the pulse-rate, but not the force of the heart, 
and, acting as a depressant, which it really is, it lowers 
blood-pressure. The classical work by Dodge and Bene- 
dict 2 shows the impairment of neuromuscular acts and 
gives the scientific background for the experience of em- 
ployers as to its cause of accidents in industry. 

The experiments of Stockhard 3 add a further indictment 
of its use as a beverage. They show an injury of male 
germ cells by alcohol to such a degree that offspring are 
distinctly impaired. In this instance also the laboratory 
has brought support to the opinion of numerous social

workers who have seen the effects of alcoholism in parent 
and child. 

Numerous studies 1 bear out all the reasons advanced for 
national prohibition and challenge those interested in 
national as well as personal health and vitality to accord 
to prohibition the same intelligent support that is to be 
given to laws controlling or prohibiting traffic in drugs, 
women, or children. 

Coffee, Cocoa, and Tea. The use of coffee, cocoa, and 
tea is so general that a dogmatic statement is antagonistic 
to many persons, and the views concerning the effects of 
such use so conflicting that a final statement at this time 
is impossible. It is probably always true that whenever 
statements vary widely the truth lies at some intermediate 
point. As regards coffee, it is unquestionably true that 
to some persons coffee is a poison, causing toxic eye con- 
ditions, disordered digestion, and nervous disturbances. 
On the other hand, some persons drink it without any 
deleterious effects that are noticeable. The same may be 
said for tea and cocoa. It is unwise to say that coffee or 
tea will harm no one. It is foolish to condemn for all. 
The path of health in this instance must be determined by 
each seeker of a larger and more abundant life. 

Some studies have been made. Lusk 2 notes: "Schum- 
burg finds that coffee and tea have no recuperative power 
over the muscles of a fatigued organism, except when 
taken with other foods. Hillsten, exercising before break- 
fast, finds that the effect of taking tea is almost negligible" 
(in increasing muscle power). Again he 3 says: "When 
theophyllin, caffein and theobromin, the methylated 
purins found in tea, coffee, and cocoa, are ingested it has 
been stated that they are not oxidized to uric acid, but 
that they increase the purin bases in the urine. However, 
Levinthal and Stanley Benedict have found the uric acid

elimination to increase in man after the ingestion of 1 to 
1.5 gram of caffein daily." 

More recent investigations than those cited by Lusk 
indicate a certain effect on digestion that is more in har- 
mony with experience than anything that has been stated 
heretofore empirically. Hawk 1 and his associates in a 
series of excellent studies on the gastric response to food 
studied the effect of tea, coffee, and cocoa (see page 185). 

While not markedly interfering with digestion, tea and 
coffee did not aid the process. Cocoa distinctly retarded 
evacuation and the development of normal acid con- 
ditions. It should be noted that fluids ingested were 
taken with a uniform meal.

The Essentials of Respiration. One of the interesting 
aspects of the study of low forms of animal life is respira- 
tion. The very simple one-celled animals breathe without 
a special respiratory apparatus. In studying such forms 
it is determined that oxygen from the air passes directly 
through the cell membrane of the animal and carbon 
dioxid passes out. This records the primary fact that is 
noticed in respiration in man: oxygen of the air is taken 
up in the lungs and carbon dioxid is given out. This truth 

801

is made clear by a comparison of the composition of air, 
both inspired (outdoor) and expired: 

Nitrogen. Oxygen. Carbon dioxid. 

Inspired air 79 20 0.04 

Expired air 79 16 4 

The essential fact, then, in human breathing is the bring- 
ing of air into the lungs so that oxygen may be taken from 
it and carbon dioxid given to it. 

This knowledge of the use made of oxygen of the air 
and of the need of the body for the vital gas has been 
known for a long time, but usually it has been interpreted 
erroneously with reference to ventilation studies. Carbon 
dioxid for many years has been considered the dangerous 
element in bad air. Dr. Chaumont set the standard in 
this respect in 1875 at 6 volumes per 10,000 as the limit of 
vitiation. In America many of the states have laws that 
require schoolrooms to be so ventilated that not more 
than 6 parts of carbon dioxid in 10,000 shall be allowed. 
For many years this was the accepted standard, but by 
many ventilation experiments it has been shown that 
CO 2 may be increased to 12 volumes without deleterious 
effects. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that 
from a health standpoint the physical conditions of the 
air are usually more important than the chemical, and 
that control of air moisture, temperature, and motion are 
generally more to be desired than control of the chemical 
conditions as represented by CO 2 . For some time the 
"badness" of inside air was attributed to an organic 
poison. Weichart claimed to have isolated an organic 
substance which was responsible, but his experiments have 
not been confirmed. On the contrary, the evidence in- 
dicates that vitiated air is produced by other factors. 
From the studies of Hill, Fliigge, and more recently of 
the New York State Commission on Ventilation, 1 it has 
been demonstrated that the * 'badness" in air in ordinary

buildings is not due to an organic poison, nor to excessive 
amounts of carbon dioxid, but rather to : 

1. Improper temperature, usually too high a tempera- 

ture. 

2. Improper humidity. 

3. Lack of air movement. 

On this point the New York State Commission on 
Ventilation 1 says: "The following tentative conclusions 
seem, however, to be indicated by the experiments of the 
first year as outlined above : 

"1. A very high room temperature, such as 86 F. 
with 80 per cent, relative humidity, produces 
slight, but distinct elevation of body tempera- 
ture, an increase in the reclining heart rate, an 
increase in the excess of standing over reclining 
heart rate, a very slight lowering of systolic 
blood-pressure, and a marked fall in the Cramp- 
ton value. 2 

"2. A moderately high room temperature, 75 F. with 
50 per cent, relative humidity, has all the effects 
noted above, although, of course, in less degree 
than the extreme temperature condition. 
"3. Even the extreme room temperature of 86 F. 
with 80 per cent, relative humidity shows no 
effect upon rate of respiration, dead space in the 
lungs, acidosis of the blood, dissociation of 
oxyhemoglobin, respiratory quotient, rate of heat 
production, rate of digestion, carbohydrate or 
protein metabolism, concentration of the urine, 
and skin sensitivity. 

"4. The power to do either mental or physical work, 
measured by the quantity and quality of the 
product by subjects doing their utmost, is not 
at all diminished by a room temperature of 86 F. 
with 80 per cent, relative humidity.

2 Crampton value: This refers to a test of heart rate and blood- 
pressure reaction described in Transactions, Fourth International 
Congress on School Hygiene, vol. v, p. 555.

"5. On the other hand, the inclination to do physical 
work, and the inclination to do mental work 
are diminished by sufficiently high room tem- 
peratures. So far as physical work is concerned 
our tests show a decrease in actual work per- 
formed, when the subject had a choice between 
working or not working, of 15 per cent, under 
the 75 F. condition and 37 per cent, under 
the 86 F. condition as compared in each case 
with 68 F. 

"6. Stagnant air at the same temperature as fresh 
air, even when it contains 20 or more parts of 
carbon dioxid and all the organic and other 
substances in the breathed air of occupied rooms, 
has, so far, shown no effect on any of the physio- 
logic responses listed above under 1 and 3, 
nor on the power or inclination to do physical 
or mental work nor on the sensations of comfort 
of the subjects breathing it. 

"7. On the other hand, the appetite for food of sub- 
jects exposed to such stagnant air may be 
slightly reduced. 

"8. These experiments seem to indicate that over- 
heated rooms are not only uncomfortable, but 
produce well-marked effects upon the heat- 
regulating and circulatory systems of the body, 
and materially reduce the inclination of occu- 
pants to do physical work. The most important 
effects of 'bad air' are due to its high tempera- 
ture, and the effects of even a slightly elevated 
room temperature, such as 75 F., are sufficiently 
clear and important to warrant careful pre- 
cautions against overheating. 

"9. The chemical changes in the breathed air of occupied 
rooms are of comparatively minor importance, 
although the substances present in such air 
may exert a slight decrease in the appetite for 
food." 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 205 

While the work of the Commission is unfinished and 
the studies on air movement and humidity are not com- 
pleted, it seems from present information available that 
the results of these studies will emphasize the importance 
of the physical factors in ventilation. 

Desirable Temperature Proper Methods of Heating. 
The desirable temperature for indoor air is 68 F. 
It should never go below 66 nor above 70 F. The rela- 
tion of temperature to humidity and its effect upon 
health has been stated above. Huntington 1 shows that 
temperature influences work done. 

Every school room and every home should possess 
a thermometer and a definite effort should be made to 
keep the temperature constant and at the proper elevation. 

When rooms are heated by stoves this is nearly impos- 
sible. It is difficult with hot air furnaces. The best 
methods of heating are with hot water or steam. 

A Valuable Experiment. A great deal of money has 
been spent devising elaborate methods of ventilation. 
Fan, plenum, exhaust, and combination systems guarantee 
to provide so many cubic feet of air per minute. Devices 
for humidifying the air and automatically regulating the 
temperature have been added. All of these mechanical 
methods of ventilation have yet to prove their value 
in the face of the following experiment: 

The Bureau of Child Hygiene, 2 Department of Health, 
New York City, conducted in 1916 and 1917 an experi- 
ment to determine the relationship between the health 
of school children and the methods of ventilation in 
classrooms. The number of children under observation 
in 1916 was 2541, and in 1916-17 the number was 2992. 
The number of class rooms in the first series studied was 
58; in the second, 76. Other important controls, such 
as age, locality, nationality, and season, were in evidence. 
Obviously here was an experiment of scientific merit.

"It was decided that three types of ventilation should 
form the basis of the study: 

Type A. 

"These were the so-called cold, open-window classrooms, 
ventilated by natural means. It was desirable to have the tem- 
perature kept at 50 F. This, however, was found to be im- 
possible owing to variations in the weather, and it therefore 
ranged from 50 to 60 degrees and occasionally higher. 

Type B. 

"These were moderate temperature classrooms, kept between 
60and 70 F., averaging about 68 F. Ventilation was wholly 
by open windows. Some rooms had gravity exhaust ducts, while 
others did not. Window deflectors were used in only one room in 
the 1916 study, while in the 1916-17 study window deflectors were 
installed and used in all rooms. 

Type C. 

"These rooms were of the same moderate temperature as Type 
B, that is, averaging 68 F. Ventilation of the classrooms was by 
the plenum, fan system installed in the buildings, the windows in 
these classrooms being kept closed." 

Physicians and nurses conducted the experiment 
during the winter and fall and late spring for a total 
period of five months. The following results are immensely 
valuable for those interested in health values in ventila- 
tion. 

It was found that in Type C classrooms the rate of 
absences from respiratory disease was 32 per cent, higher 
than in Type B classrooms and 40 per cent, higher than 
in Type A. 

It was also found that in Type C classrooms the rate 
of respiratory disease occurring among pupils in attendance 
was 98 per cent, higher than in Type B classrooms and 
70 per cent, higher than in Type A. 

Mechanical methods of ventilation in the buildings 
studied 1 must be charged, therefore, as favorable to the 
development in the winter, fall, and spring of respiratory 
diseases severe enough to keep children from school to 

1 The experiment should be repeated in other places, under different 
ventilation conditions. It should be noted that generally the 
mechanical system of ventilation is administered more easily than 
the open window system. 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 207 

an extent of from 32 to 40 per cent, more than natural 
ventilation, and of respiratory diseases not severe enough 
to keep from school, to an extent of from 70 to 98 per 
cent, more than natural ventilation by means of open 
windows. 

Equable Temperature. Equable temperature is very 
desirable. Sharp variations in temperature tax the heat- 
regulating system of the body, and frequently cause 
disturbances of the gastro-intestinal tract. With many 
persons a sense of bodily well being is very dependent 
upon an even temperature. In this country southern 
Florida and southern California afford the best illustra- 
tions of equable climate. The effect of atmospheric 
conditions upon fatigue and efficiency has been studied 
by Winslow, 1 and his results show the need for careful 
regulation of indoor temperature. A comparison of 
infant mortality and temperature changes in Chicago 
from 1907 to 1912 is shown in Fig. 20. Ward 2 mentions 
the following characteristics in climate as desirable for 
health: Frequent moderate weather changes, fairly 
marked annual and diurnal variation in temperature, 
reasonable amount of cold during part of the year, variety 
in amount of cloudiness, rainfall sufficient for grass and 
crops. He would advise that extremes be avoided. 

Proper Humidity and Means to Secure It. Water is 
always present in the atmosphere. While outdoor air 
varies greatly in its water content in different places 
and at different times of the year and day, the variation 
between the amount of water vapor in indoor air and 
outdoor air constitutes a prominent factor in the un- 
wholesomeness of indoor air. The absolute amount of 
water present in indoor air is not the entire statement 
in this connection, but the amount of moisture that can 
still be taken up at the prevailing temperature. Build-

ings ventilated by open windows present little or no 
difficulty because the outdoor humidity usually controls, 
and no essential value is achieved by attempting to secure 
indoor conditions different from outdoor. The problem 
is chiefly one related to artificial systems of ventilation, 
as in schools, and in a certain extent in modern homes, 
where little or no attention is given to ventilation by 
means of windows. 

The desirable humidity is often stated to be 60 per 
cent, (relative). This does not provide against the 
danger of excessive temperature with the resulting dry- 
ness of the air. The relative humidity may remain at 
60 per cent, and the air may be able to take up consider- 
able water vapor, as indicated by the following table 
from Rosenau 1 :

The unwholesomeness of most indoor air with reference 
to its water content lies in its excessive dryness. With 
the temperature correct, this danger may be lessened, 
and it can be said that air at a temperature of 68 F. 
and a relative humidity of 60 per cent, will usually be 
satisfactory. 

There is no method for determination of relative 
humidity that will be found practicable in the home, 
because it involves the use of an instrument that requires

adjustment, reading, and interpretation by means of a 
table. Therefore, the guide is to be a sense guide, de- 
pendent upon an interpretation of dryness of the mucous 
membranes, especially that of the nose. 

In the school accurate determination may be made 
and records kept, and the procedure may be made not 
only contributory to general sanitary improvement but 
also helpful in training in methods of hygiene. For this 
purpose the sling psychrometer is used. 

Excessive dryness in the air may be combated by: 

1. Open window ventilation. 

2. Liberal use of potted plants in the room. 

3. Pans of water placed, where it will evaporate, 
under or on radiators for steam and hot-water heating, 
and in furnace chambers for hot air. 

Excessive dryness of the air causes absorption of water 
from the body, especially from the mucous membranes. 
Man's body is about 58.5 per cent, water, so that the 
water loss in this way may well be a serious matter. 
The loss of moisture from exposed membranes interferes 
with their normal functioning. 

Effect of Wind on Metabolism. Wind and humidity 
have pronounced influences on metabolism. Wolpert's 
experiment as quoted by Lusk 1 gave the following results:

Thus it would appear that the metabolism would be 
more marked with a breeze moving about 15 miles an 
hour (8 meters per second) at a temperature of 59 to 
63 F. than with a temperature of 35 F. in a calm. The 
scientific basis for many hygienic practices in clothing 
the body is given in this experiment. The body is easily 
chilled in a wind due to loss of body heat by rapid evapo- 
ration. 

Effect of Humidity on Metabolism. The work of Wol- 
pert was conducted on a thin man clad in summer clothes.

On a hot, humid day the heat lost from the body is 
by evaporation of water. This is retarded by the humidity. 
Humidity by preventing the evaporation of perspiration 
on a hot day results in depression of the body. This is 
due to the exhaustive elimination of perspiration which 
by non-evaporation is prevented from cooling the body. 
If the temperature is moderate the heat loss may take 
place through radiation and conduction, so that perspira-

tion is not so excessive. Lusk 1 comments upon this effect 
of humidity and temperature as follows: 

"It is also interesting to note that prostrations from 
the heat occur in New York with 66 per cent, humidity 
and a temperature of 31.5 C. 2 (2.30 P. M., August 24, 
1905)." 

Air Movement and Means to Secure It. It has been 
found that many of the ill effects of bad ventilation can 
be avoided by keeping the air of the room in motion. 
Hill, in England, and Fliigge, in Germany, demonstrated 
that ah* movement was an essential element in well- 
ventilated rooms. In still ah* the body becomes sur- 
rounded by a jacket of warm moist air which produces 
the familiar symptoms of a vitiated air, even with the 
CC>2 content well below 6 volumes. 

Movement of ah* in rooms is very desirable and should 
be secured. This may most readily be accomplished 
by opening windows. Many persons do not know how 
to open windows. If the room seems badly ventilated, 
some one who doesn't know how may open the windows 
widely so that those near the windows are suddenly 
chilled. It usually happens that some one in the group 
near the windows replies by tightly closing them. Both 
err. To secure air movement the windows should be 
opened a small space only and preferably at top and 
bottom, but top at least. 

Air movement may be supplemented by an electric fan. 

The fear that some persons have for drafts is very 
real, but it is often a developed fear, dependent upon 
coddling of the body, and should be overcome by proper 
dressing and bathing. Air in movement sufficient to 
prevent unpleasant and unhealthful effects may be 
secured without injury to health. The rate of movement 
in relation to our perception as given by Rosenau 3 is as 
follows: 

1 Lusk, G.: Loc. cit., p. 148. a About 89 F. 

3 Rosenau, M. J. : Preventive Medicine and Hygiene, D. Appleton 
& Co., New York, 1913, p. 603; ibid., p. 626. 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 213 

Air moving at 1.5 foot per second 1.0 mile per hour imper- 
ceptible; 

Air moving at 2.5 feet per second 1.7 mile per hour barely per- 
ceptible ; 

Air moving at 3.5 feet per second 2.3 miles per hour draft. 

The term "draft" is relative. To some persons a blowing 
wind is not recognized as a draft; to others the slightest 
air movement is a strong draft. 

Control of Dust and Dirt. Dust is a normal constituent 
of the atmosphere and it serves a very useful purpose 
as a focus for water vapor precipitation, as a disperser 
of the sun's rays with decrease in the transparency of 
the air. Dust particles are derived from the earth, 
carbon particles in smoke, volcanoes, salt from sea spray, 
interplanetary particles, mineral dust from certain occu- 
pations, and organic dust, such as, "epithelial scales, 
seed, spores, bacteria, pollen, plant cells, fluff of various 
kinds, bites of insects, starch, pus-cells, algae, rotifers, 
fragments of hair, feathers, and bits of tissue, fibers of 
cotton, etc." 1 

The dust of great danger from a health viewpoint is 
mineral dust from trades. The dust from the earth, 
smoke, or refuse heaps is unpleasant, but mineral dust 
is distinctly injurious. 

Influence of Mineral Dust in Air on Health. The 
dust from mineral sources is injurious when present in 
large amount and when, as is usually the case, the par- 
ticles are sharp and cutting, thus serving to irritate 
body tissues. Thus in coal mining, iron and steel trades, 
stone cutting, and other dusty trades the dust is present 
in large amounts and is extremely irritating. The lungs 
are the chief organs to suffer and so definite is the injury 
to the lungs that the affection resulting is named accord- 
ing to the cause of the disease. Thus, anthracosis is 
caused by coal dust; siderosis, by iron or steel dust, 
and silicosis, by stone dust.

& Co., New York, 1913, p. 603; ibid., p. 626. 



214 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

Kober and Hanson 1 have shown that the effect of 
dust and fumes on the upper air passages may be marked. 
"Dr. Collis, after examining thousands of grinders and 
granite cutters and others exposed to inhalation of dust 
in Sheffield, Aberdeen, and elsewhere, found, as a rule, 
that the lining membrane in the interior of the nose 
for a distance of f inch was smooth, dry, and pale colored; 
the mucous membrane behind this was red and inflamed 
and generally covered with dust, while the back of the 
pharynx and pillars of the fauces were tolerant of the 
touch of the spatula used to depress the tongue, having 
lost their sensitiveness." 

Bacteria in Air. Bacteria in outdoor air do not con- 
stitute a very serious danger, and, in fact, do not have 
the importance that people usually attach to the matter. 
Bacteria do not multiply in the air, and most of them 
soon die, especially when exposed to sunshine. It may 
be safely said, therefore, that bacteria coming hi the air 
directly from another person in the liquid spray from 
coughs or sneezes are very dangerous, but if they are 
not received directly from another person, the danger 
is very small indeed. The expired air is practically free 
from bacteria. In coughing, sneezing, talking, or other 
forced respiratory movements, however, the expired 
air contains bacteria. This indicates how droplet infec- 
tion occurs. 

The ah* has been considered in former times to be a 
prolific source of disease. Malaria (bad air) and other 
diseases, such as typhoid fever, yellow fever, and rheu- 
matism, were supposed at one time to be communicated 
by the air. The knowledge of these diseases today 
rules out entirely, however, ah* as a factor in causation. 
The advances in epidemiology show that bacteria in 
outdoor ah* are usually harmless; in crowded places, 
such as street cars, schoolrooms, and other closed and

poorly ventilated places, where human beings come in 
close contact, the danger of disease transmission is very 
real. The process, however, is that of direct contact 
by means of a droplet or spray of infection from the 
nose or mouth of another person. 

The Value of Sunlight. The value of sunlight in the 
modern treatment of tuberculosis and rickets 1 illustrates 
the saying of Pliny, the elder, who wrote "Sol est reme- 
diorum maximum." The sun is the greatest cure for 
many things. Its value in the maintenance of general 
health is less appreciated than it should be. Part of 
the splendid effects of an out-of-door life is due to the 
sunshine. The ancients appreciated this fact more than 
we moderns do, as shown by the helioses of the Greeks, 
and the solaria of the Romans. 

Civilized man in the temperate zone by taking on 
clothing, by living so much indoors, protects himself 
unduly from the sun's rays. On exposure to strong sun- 
shine he shows a marked susceptibility to sunlight. 
A careful and gradual exposure in the summertime 
would generally result in improved function of the skin, 
increased nutritive changes, enrichment of the blood, 
particularly the hemoglobin content, and improved 
nerve action. In the tropics man suffers from the exces- 
sive sunlight. Woodruff 2 names excessive sunlight 
as the cause of backwardness in these regions. One 
unaccustomed to sunlight should avoid prolonged expos- 
ure at first. Sunburn, headache, sleeplessness, and other 
signs of discomfort following exposures to the sun indi- 
cate too sudden or too prolonged periods. City persons 
on vacations in the country frequently err in this regard. 
Gradually increasing the amount of body surface exposed

and the time spent in the sunshine will bring valuable 
results, if unfavorable signs are recognized and acted 
upon accordingly. 

Nature's Plan for Respiration the Respiratory Tract. 
The general plan provides that air be taken in through 
the nose, where dust and dirt are in part removed and 
the air properly warmed before passing on through the 
trachea (windpipe) to the lungs. Nature in all mechan- 
isms of the body provides a margin of safety, and that 
principle is seen in the provision that air may be breathed 
in through the mouth. This is an emergency entrance, 
however, and is not adapted either in general structure 
or function for respiration. Nose breathing alone is 
justifiable and should be practised. Obstructions in the 
nose in the forms of adenoids, growths, or deformities 
should be removed to secure the free passage so essential 
for proper breathing and vigorous health. 

The Muscular Mechanism for Respiration. Nature 
has provided a muscular mechanism by which man may 
increase the size of the chest cavity and allow air to rush 
in. This mechanism allows for an increase from side to 
side, from back to front, and from top to bottom. Fad- 
dists, singers with special "systems," and fake "professors 
of physical culture" at times advocate irrational and 
wholly unscientific methods for using the chest cavity. 

One extreme method of breathing is known as "abdomi- 
nal." This method consists in pronounced use of the 
diaphragm without the use of the intercostal muscles. 
The natural method of respiration is one that calls into 
action both diaphragm and intercostal mechanisms 
in which the greatest expansion comes in the lower chest 
and epigastrium. It has been asserted that the corseted 
mature woman breathes with a costal type of respiration, 
but that there is no fundamental difference between the 
natural respiration of man and woman has been well 
demonstrated. Children show, as a rule, an abdominal 
type, but this type is lost in the pubertal changes that 
come with adolescence, due to the increase in muscular 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 217 

power and a change from the protuberant abdomen to 
the flat type. 

Automatic Control. The rate and frequency of respira- 
tion is controlled by a group of nerve cells, the respiratory 
center in the medulla, acting in response to changes in 
the blood. True it is that we can voluntarily breathe 
deeper and faster, but clearly also, whether we do or 
not voluntarily is not related to the physiologic require- 
ments of the body. When running or engaged in feats 
of speed, strength, or endurance the act of respiration 
goes on without conscious direction, and because of this 
essential automaticity, satisfying, as it does, the needs 
of the body, an attempt of the voluntary or conscious 
kind is unnecessary and unhygienic. Certainly at no 
time or place does any individual know how fast or how 
deep he must breathe to eliminate the carbon dioxid 
produced by activity. The respiratory center does 
know, however, and if uninterrupted it will under all 
normal conditions carry out its demands and fulfil 
its physiologic obligations. 

The Matter of Breathing Exercises. There is prob- 
ably less clear thinking among physical educators on 
the subject of breathing exercises than on any other 
aspect of body training. Hall, 1 who marches in the 
procession with those who give prominence to play and 
games as contrasted with formal gymnastics, makes 
the following absurd statement: 

"Deep breathing, however caused, no doubt acts 
against auto-intoxication, gives increased power to 
resist disease, is the root of endurance under effort, and 
is of great and hitherto unsuspected importance in de- 
termining the level or intensity of life, one of the chief 
variables with which the rate and completeness of normal 
oxidation of the blood is correlated." 

The above statement may well mean that respiratory 
gymnastics in one's room before an open window, as 

1 Hall, G. S.: Adolescence, D. Appleton <& Co., New York, 1904, 
p. 102, 



218 PEKSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

is customary with those who pursue this fad, will deter- 
mine "the level or intensity of life" to the advantage 
that "auto-intoxication" is done away with and "endur- 
ance" is strengthened at the root. President Hall has 
such a keen appreciation of the biologic values in life 
that it is disconcerting to find him expressing such opinion. 
It is important to point out that breathing exercises 
in the home or following a period of gymnastics are 
unscientific and not physiologic for the following reasons: 
1. Oxygen cannot be stored up in the body. The 
passage of oxygen from the air-chambers of the 
lungs to the blood and thence to the tissue is 
dependent upon the need of the body cells for 
oxygen. If physical activity is increased, oxygen is 
required, and hence respiration is increased in rate 
and depth. Burton-Opitz 1 says in this connection : 

"The relation between the quantities of O absorbed and 
CO 2 liberated during a given period of time is designated 
as the respiratory quotient. 

"The rate and depth of the respiratory movements do 
not appreciably change the relationship of the O and CO,. 

"The general arrangement of the intracellular material 
constitutes the principal factor in the determination of the 
manner in which the dysoxidizable food-stuffs combine with 
oxygen. On this account there is imparted to the oxida- 
tions definite specificity and a limit is set to them in con- 
formity with the requirements of the different tissues. 
Consequently, the magnitude of the oxidation is regulated by 
the tissue itself and not by the amount of oxygen actually 
available" 

There is abundant physiologic evidence to show that 
the arterial blood is in a state of almost complete satura- 
tion and that this normal state is possible with an oxygen 
tension of little more than 30 mm. Hg., although the 
normal tension is at least 100 mm. Hg. In short, that 
natural respiration amply safeguards the needs of the 
tissues. Moreover, as Burton-Opitz says: 

"But even if this gas (oxygen) is supplied in pure form so that its 
pressure is increased five times, namely, from 152 mm. Hg. to 760 

1 Burton-Opitz, R.: A Text-book of Physiology, W. B. Saunders 
Co., Philadelphia, 1920, pp. 507, 511, 514, 516, 517. 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 219 

m.m. Hg., no considerable variation in the consumption of oxygen 
and output of carbon dioxid results." 

2. By respiratory exercises the proportion of oxygen 

to carbon dioxid in the lungs and blood can be 
temporarily increased, but only at the expense 
of the physiologic equilibrium of the body. An 
illustration of this disturbance may be seen by 
breathing deeply and rapidly for one or two 
minutes. The nausea, headache, disturbance in 
vision, and other sensory manifestations indicate 
the unhygienic effect of the procedure. Hender- 
son's 1 experiments in this field have been especially 
valuable in confirming this view. 
Investigators have observed that spasms and mus- 
cular twitchings may follow voluntary over- 
breathing. It may cause symptoms of tetany, 
the factor being alkalosis, due to reducing the 
amount of the blood carbon dioxid, and making 
the blood more alkaline than normal. 

3. The voluntary taking of oxygen regardless of the 

needs of the body is unphysiologic and irrational. 
The quantity of oxygen taken up by the cell is 
conditioned by the needs of the cell. Pfluger's 2 
work on the combustion of living material showed 
that. Barcroft 3 has sustained his position. The 
respiratory center provided by nature to regulate 
the oxygen supply in accordance with the body 
needs is a better guide than any voluntary, 
arbitrary, and empiric method. No individual 
at any time knows how much oxygen is needed.

4. The use of breathing exercises following a gym- 

nastic lesson is unscientific 1 and should be dis- 
continued. No teacher can tell the respiratory 
needs of any one pupil; how futile to set a respira- 
tory rate for 40 children when there is not 
sufficient knowledge to guide intelligently, and 
when respiratory needs vary tremendously in 
different individuals. 

5. The use of breathing exercises to increase the size 

of the lungs and chest, unless used for corrective 
or therapeutic purposes in individual and pre- 
scribed-for cases, is unscientific and dangerous. 
Lung development should be an expression of 
increased respiratory need and should follow as a 
response of the respiratory mechanism to the 
need for oxygen by the tissues of the body. It 
would be as irrational to develop a large heart 
out of proportion to the rest of the body as it 
is to develop large lungs without reference to 
body needs. 

6. The belief that breathing exercises and large lungs 

were inimical to the development of pulmonary 
tuberculosis is unfounded in fact. Tuberculosis 
is related directly to personal habits, sanitation, 
and sources of contagion. There is no char- 
acteristic tuberculous chest except in the chronic 
stages of the disease. 

7. Since tuberculosis develops most frequently in the 

apex, the less frequently used portion of the 
lungs, it would seem to be dangerous to develop 
a very large lung and thus produce a larger area 
not used continually. 2 A lung that is related 

1 Burton-Opitz has unpublished data clearly showing that the tidal 
air is greater under conditions of maximum respirations with the 
arms hanging easily at the sides than with the arm movements 
usually employed in breathing exercises.

to the habits of exercise, life, and needs of the 
individual is a better mechanical instrument 
than one much larger in size and power and un- 
related to the physiologic body requirements. 
In the latter case it is reasonable to suppose 
that such a lung would be more susceptible to 
disease because of the larger unused area. 
8. The evils aimed at in breathing exercises are to be 
corrected by physical exercise that will not only pro- 
duce increased respiratory action and gaseous inter- 
change, but also will give additional hygienic effect. 
Health of the Respiratory System. Health of the 
lungs and respiratory tract is dependent upon many 
factors. The general health of the body, digestion, circu- 
lation, and elimination are important factors. The air 
breathed, the condition of the nose and throat, and the 
matter of exercise in the open air are important. Specific 
directions for avoiding tuberculosis will be given later, 
but aside from this infection, and for the maintenance 
of good condition in the pulmonary system, the following 
points are to be noted: 

1. Nose breathing is essential. The nares are con- 

structed to warm cold air and to screen out from 
the air dust and germs. If necessary, surgery 
should be employed to free the nares from ade- 
noids, spurs, growths, and other obstructions. 

2. Cold bathing is invaluable to keep the tone of the 

body and especially the tone of the mucous mem- 
branes of the respiratory tract in good condition. 
Numberless persons have freed themselves from 
"colds" by a faithful habit of the morning cold 
bath. 

3. The best exercise for lung development is running 

for boys, and dancing for girls in the open air. 
La Grange recommends skipping for girls. Swim- 
ming, mountain climbing, hiking, and outdoor 
games are more important than any respiratory 
gymnastics ever devised. 



222 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

4. In the prevention of colds the following should be 
noted in addition to cold bathing: 

(1) Sufficient sleep in well ventilated room. If body is 

well protected by bed clothing, there should be no 
fear of drafts. A direct draft upon the head is un- 
desirable. 

(2) Avoid close, poorly ventilated rooms, and especially 

those with high temperature. 

(3) Avoid chilling the body. Keep the body warm when 

riding or sitting quiet. When walking or exercising 
there is no danger; the mistakes are made when 
resting following the activity. 

(4) Keep the general health at the best and highest level 

possible. 



Colds. Colds are very common health disturbances 
and because they are not liable to cause immediate 
death they are regarded by many people as of no great 
importance. Hutchinson suggests, however, that a 
person's age is not dependent upon the number of years 
that have passed over one's head, but upon the number 
of colds that have passed through one's head. The best 
medical opinion supports the view that colds, however 
minor may be their temporary effect, are of enough 
importance to warrant serious painstaking care to avoid 
contracting them. 

Colds are caused by bacteria which at times attack 
the body in great force and cause marked disturbance, 
with temperature, loss of appetite, and general feeling 
of disability, or at times causing only a slight indispo- 
sition for a day or two. The latter condition is probably 
responsible for the phrase: "Oh, I only have a cold." 

The variability in the severity of the condition is 
due to a variation in two factors: the virulence or number 
of invading bacteria and the resistence of the body to 
the infection. The virulence or number of bacteria is 
increased at times when there is an epidemic of colds. 
At such times only the best resistance will prevail against 
the infection. Therefore, it is always wise to avoid a 
person who has a cold, and to isolate one's self when 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 223 

one has a cold. The protection against the bacteria 
then is by avoiding contact with those who are infected, 
and by increasing or by maintaining body resistance. 

The matter of resistance is of considerable importance. 
We may understand the problem better by noting that 
there is a dual aspect to the subject: resistance of local 
parts, such as nose, throat, and accessory structures, 
and resistance of the body in general. 

Many persons are susceptible to colds because of 
abnormality in the nose or throat. The common forms 
are adenoids, enlarged tonsils, and nasal obstruction. 
Nasal obstruction may be due to growths, to nasal in- 
juries and septal deformities, or to abnormal develop- 
ment of the teeth and palate in childhood. Adenoid 
growth and tonsils are frequently the cause of colds in 
children. All of these abnormalities increase the liability 
to colds, and, in addition, render it more likely that serious 
involvement of accessory structures will occur. Thus, 
middle-ear disease, sinus trouble, and even the dreaded 
mastoid infection may result. To increase the resistance 
of local parts by having abnormalities corrected is the 
reasonable thing to do. 

If local parts are in good condition a cold can result 
only if the invading bacteria overcome the general de- 
fenses of the body. General defense is known as general 
resistance also. It is upon personal hygiene that re- 
sistance is largely dependent. Chilling the body, getting 
the feet wet, dietary indiscretions, constipation, over- 
work, loss of sleep, and other matters may lower the 
resistance sufficiently to allow infection to occur. These 
causes may need special attention. 

Experiments upon animals show that chilling and 
overeating do diminish the body's resistance to infection. 
Rabbits which have been chilled subsequent to inocula- 
tion with cold-producing bacteria show a higher rate 
of mortality from the disease than animals similarly 
inoculated, but not chilled. The old belief that drafts 
cause colds is justified in this sense that they will congest 



224 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

the mucous membranes and render the individual more 
susceptible. This point needs examination though, be- 
cause by rational health habits the skin may be trained 
to adjust readily to all the usual variations in air move- 
ment and temperature. This training is important. 
Cold baths for those who can take them is the most 
important single procedure for skin training. Those 
not able to take the cold bath should wash the neck 
and face with cold water every morning and splash 
some cold water over the chest. 

Getting the feet wet should be avoided whenever 
possible. If it cannot be avoided, the changing of shoes 
and stockings as soon as possible is, of course, impera- 
tive. Standing out-of-doors in cold weather may re- 
sult in chilling of the body even though warmly clothed. 
To avoid this one should if to be out-of-doors is essential 
at that time continuously contract the body muscles. 
Rising on the toes, shifting the weight, contracting arm 
and back muscles will be found efficacious. 

Dietary indiscretions and constipation lower the 
resistance to colds. Overeating is to be avoided for 
this as well as for other good reasons. Constipation is 
to be combated, of course, with every proper food, and 
other natural means, such as exercise, plenty of water, 
and regularity in evacuation. If these do not suffice 
to correct the condition, a physician should be consulted. 

Avoidance of overwork and loss of sleep are important 
for this as well as for other good reasons. 

Shall a nasal douche be used? Are vaccines valuable 
in preventing or treating colds? What home remedies 
are recommended? These are common questions from 
those who suffer from colds. In general, nasal douches 
are not advisable. They should be used only on pre- 
scription. The snuffing of solutions into the nose is 
dangerous, and may lead to middle-ear infection. For 
the same reason care in blowing the nose should be taken 
by closing one side completely and blowing through the 
other, allowing the front opening to be unobstructed. 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 225 

Vaccines have been recommended for sufferers from 
continual colds, and in some cases the results have been 
good. The procedure is not well enough established to 
give it general approval. 

The home treatment of a cold is, briefly: stimulate 
the bowels by a laxative, preferably a salt, such as mag- 
nesium sulphate or citrate of magnesia, and go to bed, 
keeping the body warm. Ventilate the room thoroughly. 
A hot foot bath for fifteen to twenty minutes is good 
treatment, but the danger of catching cold after emerging 
from the body bath is so great that, if used, it should be 
supervised carefully. 

If one has over 100 degrees of temperature a physician 
should be called. The onset of other and more serious 
diseases is marked at times by the symptoms of an 
ordinary cold. 

After a cold has passed one should not take on work 
too early. Put the load on gradually. Learn from one 
experience, and by improving the living routine make 
succeeding infections, if not impossible, at least, exceed- 
ingly difficult. 

Tonsils. The tonsils are glands placed on either side 
of the opening from the mouth into the pharynx. In 
childhood they probably serve to protect the individual 
against respiratory diseases, but if normal they dis- 
appear soon after puberty. As a matter of fact, the 
prime purpose of the tonsils has never been determined. 
If the tonsils become diseased, then the question is, not 
what function do they have, but rather, how serious is the 
infection, and what will happen if they are not removed. 
There are many old-fashioned beliefs about the tonsils, 
but they must give way before the clearly proved evi- 
dence of tonsil complicity in heart and rheumatism 
affections. 

The entrance for the organisms causing valvular 
disease of the heart or rheumatism is via the tonsils 
in many cases. This evidence has been available from 
clinical experience; it has been corroborated by laboratory 

15 



226 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

findings. The case is complete. Diseased tonsils are 
dangerous to health! 

The present-day operative procedure for the removal 
of infected tonsils is correct. It is important to have 
a skilled surgeon perform the operation. There is no 
danger to be feared if the operation is in the hands of a 
skilled performer. The removal of the tonsils enlarges 
the throat-mouth cavity and increases the volume and 
resonance of the voice. 

Children have large tonsils. These glands decrease 
in size with age. If not infected they will become very 
small. The size of the tonsils is not an indication for 
removal unless they cause obstruction. Real signs of 
disease and infection will be sought by the reputable and 
skilled surgeon before advising removal (see Chapter XIV). 

Adenoids. At the opening of the nasal cavities into 
the upper part of the pharynx there occurs in children 
a growth of lymphoid tissue, called adenoids. This 
growth may become so extensive as to cause interference 
with nasal breathing, obstruction of the eustachian 
tube orifice, and hence interference with hearing. The 
tonsils are to be removed not because they are large, 
but because they are diseased; the adenoids are rarely 
diseased, but are dangerous to health because of enlarge- 
ment. The effects of adenoids are diminished physical 
activity, lack of energy, vigor and vitality, and malnu- 
trition. They constitute a serious health handicap for 
the child. In addition, by causing mouth breathing, 
they produce a lack of proper development of the bones 
of the nose, cheek, and jaws. The operation is simple, 
not dangerous, and should be advised and followed if 
indicated. 

The Joint Committee on Health Problems in Educa- 
tion 1 gives the following structural, functional, and general 
effects of adenoids:

(a) Structural effects: 

1. High arched palate. 

2. Narrowing of upper jaw. 

3. Deformity of chest, resulting from obstructed and im- 

perfect breathing, shown by lateral depression of front 
of chest and prominent sternum (breast bone). 

4. Disturbed development of teeth and vocal organs. 

5. Large tonsils in one-third of cases.

idea of anything new; stupidity; difficulty in re- 
taining ideas; weakness of memory; inability to 
turn thought on a definite subject; lack of power

(6) Irritability, depression, and often disorderly conduct. 

2. Deafness. 

3. Defects in sense of smell and taste.

5. Chronic rhinopharyngeal catarrh, shown by a persistent 

nasal discharge. This is often one of the first symptoms. 
In very young children it is manifested by snuffles. 

6. Obstruction of air passages resulting in breathing dis- 

turbances, manifested by open mouth and great rest- 
lessness at night, the child being forced to assume 
various attitudes, such as sleeping on face, in order to 
breathe better. 

7. Reflex: 

(a) Catarrhal spasm of larynx, or croup. 
(6) Headache. 

(c) Intractable cough and hoarseness. 

(d) Bronchial asthma. 

(e) Enuresis (incontinence of urine), 
(c) General effects: 

1. Malnutrition and anemia. 

2. Underdevelopment, physical and mental. 

3. Predisposition to otitis media (middle-ear disease), 

laryngitis, colds of a remittant nature; increased sus- 
ceptibility to disease infections, such as tuberculosis, 
diphtheria, scarlet fever, etc. 

Hygiene of the Voice. Proper use and care of the 
voice are very important. A pleasing voice is an asset 
of real worth to a person. Children develop the voice 
according to the voices heard most often. The influence 
of parents and teachers upon voice formation in the 
child is more powerful than any other factor in deter- 
mining the quality of the voice. The child that hears 



228 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

harsh, coarse speech will develop like vocal qualities, 
and the child hearing soft resonant tones will speak 
softly and resonantly if not prevented by defects in the 
nose or throat, or by disturbances due to poor co-ordina- 
tion in speech control. Adenoids, tonsils, abnormalities 
of the palate, obstruction in the nose are the common 
causes of poor vocal sounds. These conditions must be 
remedied before improvement in speech is to be expected. 
After abnormalities are corrected speech training may 
be necessary to develop new co-ordinations and to re- 
educate the muscles of the throat. 

Training of the voice may be accomplished either by 
teachers of oral expression or by teachers of singing. 
Both forms of training are valuable if good methods are 
followed. The methods of teaching the use of the voice 
are indeed numerous. No principles can be stated that 
will serve effectively in choosing proper teachers; results 
alone can determine. 

The care of the voice is more important to professional 
singers and speakers, but for all persons the voice is so 
useful, so much a part of living, that certain rules of 
hygiene should be noted and followed. 

The voice responds to general bodily states. Weak- 
ness and muscular flabbiness cannot support a good 
voice. The voice takes on the quality of the body in 
general as regards its health. A person in poor health 
will suffer with fatigue of the voice, and under use there 
will develop inflammatory conditions, leading frequently 
to repeated colds in the larynx, called laryngitis. The 
voice during an attack of laryngitis must not be used 
more than is absolutely necessary. Singing at such 
times is especially harmful. Perfect rest for the voice 
is the best form of treatment for laryngitis. 

A frequent cause of poor vocal production is poor 
posture. A relaxed, drooping position of the trunk and 
head allows the larynx to sink and results in poor tones. 
The basis for good sound production is an erect posture 
with the abdomen well supported by muscular contrac- 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 229 

tion and the chest carried high. A strained position 
is not desired, but one of erectness and balance. 

Smoking causes irritation and thickening of the mucous 
membrane of the throat and may result in a chronic 
cough. Improper voice placement may so strain the 
cords that the singing voice is entirely lost. The efforts 
of altos to sing soprano, and of baritones to sing tenor 
lead logically to disaster. The voice must be used properly 
to serve adequately. 

Tuberculosis. A variety of disease processes may de- 
velop in the respiratory system. Bronchitis, pneumonia, 
pleurisy, empyema, and others are all important. Some 
of these will be discussed briefly in Chapter XIII. Pul- 
monary tuberculosis is so prevalent and its effects are 
so disastrous at times, that it is important to describe 
the disease at length, its mode of transmission, its pre- 
vention, and its treatment. 

Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the Bacillus tuber- 
culosis. This bacterium may attack almost any organ 
in the body. There may be tuberculosis of the lungs, 
liver, spleen, intestines, kidney, bones, brain, and other 
structures. In children it is more commonly seen in 
bone and gland infection; in adults it is more frequent in 
the lungs. 

The cold blooded animals are rarely affected. It 
does not affect birds, and rarely horses, sheep, goats, 
cats, and dogs. It is a common disease among cattle, 
and its wide-spread prevalence among milch cows accounts 
in part for many cases of the bovine type in man. 

In man the disease is one of the most serious from an 
economic and social point of view. It is estimated that 
one-seventh of all deaths in England and one-ninth of all 
deaths in the United States are due to the disease. 

Cause of the Disease. The disease is caused by a 
minute bacterium that is able to grow and develop in 
the body under favorable conditions. Two things are 
necessary: the organisms, and a condition favorable 
to their growth and development. In this respect it is 



230 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

helpful to think of these essentials in the light of Osier's 
famous analogy, and consider the nature of the seeds 
(bacteria) and the soil (the human host). 

The Seeds. The bacteria are scattered widely among 
human habitations. The two chief sources are: The ex- 
pectoration of persons with advanced disease of the lungs, 
and the milk of tuberculous cows. 

There are other sources probably derived from the 
former. Scores of experiments have demonstrated the 
presence of bacilli in samples of dust from public 
buildings, streets, railway coaches, traction cars, etc. 
These bacilli are so ubiquitous that in cities, at least, 
few individuals pass a week without coming in con- 
tact with them and affording an opportunity for 
their lodgment in the respiratory passages. From the 
street the bacilli may be brought into the house on the 
shoes, the skirts of women, the hair of cats and dogs, 
and in the dust of the air. The tubercle bacilli of the 
bovine type are usually distributed by the milk of tuber- 
culous cows. Park has shown that from 6 to 10 per cent. 
of the deaths in children with tuberculosis was of the 
bovine type, thus indicating the supreme importance of 
using for dairy purposes only those cows that are tuberculin 
tested and shown to be free from tuberculosis. 

The Sail It is a very interesting and highly instruc- 
tive fact that approximately 90 per cent, of all people 
are at some time infected with the tubercle bacillus. 
This is instructive especially because a very much smaller 
percentage die of the disease. The health of the body, 
i. e.j resistance to disease, is a prominent factor in the 
case. Osier's 1 famous analogy of the Parable of the 
Sower is interesting: 

"Some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls of the 
air came and devoured them up." These are the tubercle 
bacilli scattered widely over the human environment, 
the majority of which die. "Some fell upon stony places." 

1 Osier, W. : The Principles and Practice of Medicine, D. Apple- 
ton & Co., New York, 1912, p. 157. 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 231 

These are the ones that find lodgment in many persons, 
but they do not develop because "they have no root.'* 
"Some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up and 
choked them." This represents the bacilli that find 
suitable body soil for growth, but the thorns, representing 
the protecting forces of the body, get the better of the 
struggle. 

"But others fell on good ground and sprang up and 
bore fruit an hundred fold." This is the group that 
produces one-ninth of all deaths in the United States, 
and that costs about $200,000,000 annually; that brings 
sorrow and suffering to thousands and ruins the plans 
and purposes of many lives. To know what makes 
the soil favorable for the development of the seeds is 
very important. 

Predisposing Factors. 1. Environment. It is true 
that one can acquire a predisposition to the disease. 
Dwellers in the cities in dark alleys and tenement houses, 
workers in cellars and ill-ventilated rooms, and persons 
addicted to drink are very prone to the disease. Dr. 
Trudeau demonstrated the effect of environment when 
he showed that rabbits, inoculated with tubercle bacilli, 
if confined in a dark, damp place, without sunlight and 
fresh air, rapidly succumbed, while others inoculated 
in the same way, but allowed to run wild, recovered or 
showed very slight lesions. In this connection it is in- 
structive to note that occupants of prisons, asylums, 
and poor-houses, and large unsanitary factories respond 
like Trudeau's rabbits in the cellar. Environment is a 
factor of first-rate importance, and the social and economic 
conditions creating unfavorable environment are at the 
crux of the problem. The kind of people most likely 
to get tuberculosis are those whose environment is favor- 
able for the bacillus. 

An important factor in environment is occupation. 
The work one does is restricted to place and surround- 
ings. Hence the death-rate from tuberculosis, classed 
by occupation, is significant of the influence in the en-

The influence of occupation on the development of 
tuberculosis is indicated in two statistical charts (Figs. 
21, 22) presented by the Prudential Life Insurance 
Company of America. 

2. Heredity. It was very common some years ago to 
hear of the importance of heredity in the acquirement 
of tuberculosis. Today there is no general acceptance 
at all that tuberculosis is inherited biologically; the 
term "tendency" is used to indicate that children of 
tuberculous parents are more likely to acquire the disease, 
because there is an inherited weakness or susceptibility. 
There is considerable reason for believing the "tendency" 
theory. It is true that children of tuberculous parents 
are often weak and malnourished, but the important 
thing to remember is that these children inherit tuber-

parents, that they come into a home where tuber-

very little importance; environment, on the contrary, 
is exceedingly significant. 

3. Race. That individuals may inherit a weakness 
to the disease is well illustrated by the fact of racial

susceptibility. Negroes are very prone to the disease 
(Fig. 23), and the American Indian since his civilization 
has succumbed in large numbers. The Irish are very 
susceptible; the Jews very resistant. 1 




4. Sex. Women have a lower mortality than men (Fig. 
23). The cause is not known.

235 



5. Habits of Life. Aside from environmental factors, 
such as light, air, and general surroundings, there are 





personal factors that tend to make the soil favorable 
for the development of tuberculosis. These may be 
briefly summarized under several headings: 



236 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

(a) Overwork. Fatigue of the body resulting from too long hours 
of labor or lack of sufficient rest, reduces bodily resistance 
and favors the development of tuberculosis. 

(6) Improper Food. Malnutrition with the resulting devitaliza- 
tion of the body presents an unusual danger in this con- 
nection. This is especially true for children who eat in- 
sufficient eggs, milk, green vegetables, and meat. 

(c) Lack of Outdoor Air and Exercise. It has often been shown 
that outdoor air and exercise have direct effect upon the 
production of hemoglobin and increase of leukocytes in the 
blood. The general wholesome effect upon all the functions 
of the body is well known; the lack of these factors leaves 
the body weak and ineffectual and offers a ready soil for 
tuberculosis. 

Prevention. The problem of prevention is twofold- 
personal and social. It relates, on the one hand, to ade- 
quate care of the personal health, and on the other to 
intelligent social effort to provide sanitary conditions 
for others. This disease hi relation to health illustrates 
in a striking way that hygiene can never be an academic 
or cultural subject. It is only of significance and meaning 
as it is lived. It illustrates also that as regards attitudes, 
the one fostering a sense of social responsibility is of the 
first and foremost importance even for those who are 
selfish, primitive, and instinctive. 

1. Personal Prevention. The problem here is keeping 
one's health at the highest possible level. For one with 
the tendency or exposed directly to the disease, this is 
of paramount importance. This means prevention of 
fatigue, eating proper food, securing adequate hours 
and conditions of sleep, and avoidance of insanitary 
conditions of work in factory or home. 

2. Social Prevention. Clearly this measure is the 
more important, and if achieved with reasonable success 
it will accomplish for all what a personal program could 
not hope to secure alone. There must be at least six 
parts to this program: 

1. Education of the public, and especially the tuberculous, in the 

nature, course, prevention, and treatment of the disease. 

2. Legislation that places tuberculosis on the list of reportable 

diseases. 



HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 237 

3. Improvement of the housing conditions of the poor and of the 

working conclitions in all industries not satisfactory. 

4. State or municipal legislation and control relating to the milk 

supply, food supply; cleanliness of streets, sleeping cars, and 
public places; enforcement of the ordinances against spitting. 

5. Adequate hospital and sanatorium facilities to care for those who 

have the disease. 

6. Prevention of other diseases especially predisposing, such as, 

in children: 
(a) Measles, which is frequently followed by pulmonary 

tuberculosis, and 
(6) Whooping-cough, which predisposes to tuberculosis. 

Treatment. It is very instructive in connection with 
this disease that nature provides a cure frequently, if 
the individual will early return to the course that nature 
asks of all who wish to live well. The treatment is not 
by medicines, but by 

1. Outdoor air and sunshine, and 

2. Nourishing food. 

The importance of early recognition is very great. It 
can be said with considerable assurance that early cases 
will recover (Fig. 24) if given the above treatment. 
Late cases are often hopeless. There should be keen 
appreciation of the value of medical examination of 
school children, workmen, and college students every- 
where. 

The question of treatment cannot be dismissed with- 
out vigorous warning against the unscientific cults, the 
blatant charlatans who scream their cures, and the 
futility of Christian Science, chiropractic, osteopathy, 
and spiritualism in this disease. 

Vaccines 1 are used at times in the treatment of the 
disease. They are likely to be of greatest value when 
used by a specialist experienced in the use of tuberculin. 
The von Pirquet test is a diagnostic test of value in 
children under four years of age, and of relatively less 
value with increasing age. The Calmette test for the 
diagnosis of tuberculosis is not to be used; and it would

liability to anaphylaxis (developed sensitivity to foreign proteins).

be strange to find a modern physician using it as a diag- 
nostic test.

The Importance of the Circulation. The circulation 
of the blood through the body is important because 
the blood serves to carry to the tissues of the body oxygen 
from the lungs and food-stuffs from the digestive tract 1 ; 

1 Burton-Opitz has shown that an amount of blood equal to the 
entire amount in the body of a dog traverses the liver every three 
minutes, Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology, 1912, 
p. 189. 

239 



240 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

it carries waste and excess water to the organs of elimina- 
tion; it assists in the regulation of temperature; and, 
finally, it is the medium for the transmission of the internal 
secretions from the ductless glands. 

From this statement it follows that the keeping of a 
good circulation is a most important affair for every one. 
This is not generally recognized. The deaths from 
heart disease are apparently on the increase. At the 
present time the number of deaths from heart disease 
exceeds the deaths from tuberculosis. The Census 
Bureau reports for 1920 in the registration area the 
following: Organic heart disease, 124,143; tuberculosis 
(all forms), 99,916. The Association for the Prevention 
and Relief of Heart Disease reports the following facts: 
"There are now not less than 20,000 children in the 
public schools of New York City already handicapped 
by permanently damaged hearts. At Bellevue Hospital 
alone last year there were treated 1413 patients from the 
advanced stages of heart disease. 

"10,682 deaths in New York City in 1916 were attributed 
directly to organic diseases of the heart, a number greater 
than either tuberculosis or cancer. 

"Deaths caused by organic heart disease 10,682 

Deaths caused by tuberculosis (all forms) 9,622 

Deaths caused by cancer 4,702" 

The economic loss due to impaired circulation is 
very great. In addition, children with a handicap of 
heart disease present a serious problem for parents, the 
school, and society in general. To prevent heart disease 
and to maintain a high level of circulatory efficiency 
are important goals. 

The Increase in Circulatory Disease. We have become 
accustomed to think of the seriousness of tuberculosis 
and cancer; the preceding figures make heart disease 
appear truly significant. These figures are part of a 
general fact borne out by statistics, namely, that in the 
United States there has been since 1890 a steady in- 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 241 

crease in mortality from diseases of the heart, blood- 
vessels, and kidneys. These three are so often found 
associated that clinicians use the term "cardiovascular- 
renal disease." By better child care, by improved sani- 
tation, and other public health measures the mortality 
from the communicable diseases, especially in youth, 
has been decreased, but the number of persons dying 
in early adult life is increasing. This increase in deaths 
due to circulatory or kidney disease suggests serious 
questions concerning the vitality of the people and 
their habits of living. 

Now while the mortality from this cause is increasing 
in the United States, the expectation of life in the same 
adult periods is more favorable in England, Wales, 
Prussia, Sweden, and other European countries. The 
meaning and significance of this increase in the chronic 
degenerative diseases has been brought out by the Life 
Extension Institute, Inc., and the cause for this increase 
expressed by Fisher and Fisk. 1 

The chief factors in causing chronic diseases are the 
following : 

CAUSES OF CHRONIC DISEASE, PREMATURE BREAKDOWN, AND PRE- 
MATURE DEATH 

Heredity. Mental inactivity. 

Infections. Physical inactivity. 

Poisons. Too much food. 

Mental strain. Too little food. 

Physical strain. Badly balanced diet. 

Accidents, injury. 

A knowledge of these causes plainly points the way 
to their control. 

Plan of the Circulation. To watch the circulating 
blood in the web of a frog's foot, to see the contracting 
heart of a man in a fluoroscopic picture, to watch the 
clotting of blood and the separation of the plasma are 
wonderful glimpses of Nature's marvelous provision

New York., 1921, p. 393.

242 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

for life processes. The study of the circulation in a book 
is a prosaic affair compared to the ebb and flow of its 
tide in the human body. 

A rather helpful analogy may be drawn between the 
circulation of the blood and the water-supply system 
of a large city. A water system is made up of powerful 
pumps, water mains, and the water. The body circula- 
tion is composed of a powerful pump, the heart; mains 
that are adjustable in size, the blood-vessels 1 ; and a liquid, 
the blood. For purposes of discussion the system will 
be presented under three headings the blood, the vessels, 
and the pump. 

The Blood. One-twentieth of the weight of the body 
is blood. If an individual weighs 140 pounds, 7 of the 
140 are blood. One may lose one-fourth of the blood 
and live, but the loss of one-third is usually fatal, unless 
immediate transfusion is performed. 

The discussion of this chapter will follow the outline of 
the composition of the blood as given in Table VIII, and 
will conclude with the heart and vessels. 

Red Blood-cells. The red cells (red corpuscles) of the 
blood are small, circular, disk-shaped bodies. The 
diameter of one is 7.7 micra (1 micron = 0.001 mm.); 
it would take about 25,000 micra to make 1 inch. There 
are 5,000,000 red cells in every cubic centimeter of blood 
for man, and 4,500,000 for woman. These cells are 
important because of a very vital function they perform 
in carrying oxygen to the tissues from the lungs. They 
are able to do this by virtue of having in their cell bodies 
a substance, hemoglobin, which has the property of com- 
bining chemically with the oxygen as it passes through 
the lungs, thus forming oxyhemoglobin. In this form 
all the oxygen, except a small amount in solution in the 

1 Only the smaller arteries are adjustable. The veins and large 
arteries do not change their lumen, neither do the lymph-vessels. 
The inclusion of the lymph circulation in the circulation of the blood 
is desirable for purposes of this discussion. It is not illogical to do 
so, although the flow of lymph from the tissues to the heart is in 
special lymph-vessels (lymphatics).

plasma, is carried to the tissues and is given up to the 
cells of the body when needed. There is no mechanism 
for storing the oxygen in the body, and as soon as the 
oxygen leaves the red cell it is used in the oxidation 
of some food element. 

The hemoglobin of the red cell is extremely important. 
If it is inadequate in amount in the body a condition 
known as anemia develops. Anemia may result from a 
decrease in the percentage of hemoglobin in each cell 
or by a reduction in the total amount in the blood through 
a diminution in the number of cells. In the one case 
the cells are usual in number, but contain less than the 
normal percentage of hemoglobin in each cell; in the 
other the hemoglobin may be normal in amount in each 
cell, but the number of cells is reduced, and hence the 



244 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

total amount of hemoglobin in the blood is lessened. 
Anemia is a very common condition, especially in young 
and growing girls, and it is, therefore, important to 
determine its causes and prevent its occurrence. 
Dr. Cabot 1 gives the causes of anemia as follows: 

a) Hemorrhage gastric, hemorrhoidal, traumatic, puerperal. 

6) Malaria, more rarely sepsis or other infections. 

c) Malignant disease (cancer). 

d) Chronic suppurations (old sores with discharge), 
(e) Chronic glomerulonephritis (Blight's disease). 

(/) Cirrhosis of the liver (inflammation and destruction of normal 

liver cells). 

(g) Poisons, especially lead. 
(h) Chronic dysentery, 
(i) Intestinal parasites. 

The explanations in parentheses are mine. J. F. W. 

Now the causes of anemia are well known. In any 
effort to correct anemia and secure good blood the first 
step must be to remove the cause of the disturbance. 
This cannot be done by giving iron or a similar blood 
"remedy" unless the source of the trouble is removed, 
e. g., cancer, malaria, intestinal parasites, etc. 

It is interesting that Dr. Cabot does not include the 
cause that is so commonly thought of by the layman, 
namely, lack of exercise, fresh air, and good food. In 
speaking of this point Dr. Cabot says, "It is important 
to remember that insufficient food or even starvation 
does not produce anemia, 2 and so far as we know no 
form of bad hygiene has any notable effect upon the 
blood. Persons may grow very pale under bad hygienic 
conditions, but their blood is usually not affected un- 
less one of the diseased conditions mentioned above is 
present." 

Bad hygiene in connection with diseased conditions 
aids the development of anemia, and the need of favor- 

1 Cabot, R. C. : Physical Diagnosis, 5th edition, Wm. Wood & 
Co., New York, 1912, p. 447. 

2 Selenksy, McCollum, and others have shown that food deficient 
in certain substances has marked effects upon the condition of the 
blood. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 245 

able hygiene in overcoming the effect of anemia is well 
known by many who work with the sick and diseased. 

In this connection it is necessary to speak of medi- 
cines in the cure of anemia. Hemoglobin contains iron, 
and for this reason iron has been used for many years 
in the treatment of anemia. It is most often prescribed 
by physicians in a form known as Blaud's pills. These 
consist of ferrous carbonate and must be prepared fresh. 
Other methods of administering iron are employed, but 
the most valuable way to get iron into the blood is through 
the food eaten. It is a known fact that certain foods 
are rich in iron, and the most effective way at times to 
give iron to the body is by securing in the diet food- 
stuffs that are rich in iron. (See Table V on page 175.) 

In the individual weighing from 132 to 154 pounds 
there are about 3 grams of iron. In numerous experi- 
ments to determine the amount of iron needed to sus- 
tain the equilibrium of the body Sherman 1 reports that 
"the requirement appears to have varied with individuals 
and with the nature of the diet from 0.006 to 0.016 gram 
(6-16 mg.) of iron per man per day." In estimating 
the amount of food rich in iron required Sherman says, 
"We might conclude from these results that a daily 
allowance of 10 to 12 mg. of food should suffice for the 
maintenance of iron equilibrium in an average man 
under favorable conditions, but until the conditions 
which determine a larger metabolism of iron are more 
clearly defined it would seem desirable to set a higher 
standard, perhaps 15 mg. of food iron per man per day." 

Those who desire to enrich the blood with iron will 
have more success by eating food 2 rich in iron than by 
taking iron internally. Taking iron into the stomach 

1 Sherman, H. C. : Chemistry of Food and Nutrition, The Mac- 
millan Co., New York, 1920, p. 299. 

2 Care must be taken not to be misled by advertisements. Manu- 
facturers and distributors frequently create or capitalize a popular 
interest in health without assuming responsibility for results. Just 
now "Have you had your iron, today?" is a familiar slogan. Figure 
18 and Table V will indicate accessible sources of food iron.

and depending upon the processes of absorption and 
assimilation to change this medicinal iron into blood 
iron is a doubtful measure. 

Appreciating the desire of people to have good blood, 
unscrupulous manufacturers put on the market and 
widely advertise preparations which are supposed to 
have a peculiar power of conveying iron to the blood-

glycerophosphate, and small amounts of potassium and chlorid, and 
the presence of cascara. Quantitative examinations were made, and 
so far as the essential ingredients mix vomica and iron of the 
nostrum are concerned, gave the following results: 

Total nux vomica alkaloids per tablet ^ grain. 

Iron (Fe) per tablet ^V grain. 

"According to these analyses, there is only one-twenty-fifth of a 
grain of iron in each 'Nuxated Iron' tablet, while the amount of nux 
vomica, expressed in terms of its potent alkaloids, is practically 
*' ible. If a person wants to take iron on his own responsibility 



and this cannot be recommended it is possible to get this drug 
in a staple form in the well known Blaud's Pills. In a dollar bottle 
of 'Nuxated Iron' the purchaser gets, according to our analysis, less 
than 2 grains of iron; in 100 Blaud's Pills, which can be purchased 
at any drug store for from 50 to 75 cents, there are 48 grains of iron. 
The claim that 'Nuxated Iron' possesses great advantages over 
other forms'of iron is the sheerest advertising buncombe." 

One part of the patent medicine fake is to give the 
preparation seeming reliability and character by using 
the name of a physician in the advertising matter. The 
Journal points out that the physician used to endorse 
Nuxated Iron is without professional standing. 

This preparation has been dealt with at some length 
because it represents a group of nostrums that advertise 
to procure health for the individual, and all their adver- 
tising and medicine are directly subversive of health. 
The individual who seeks to live a complete and effective 
life will leave out of account all such commercialized 
products. Health comes from living hi the right way 
and cannot be secured by taking patent medicine. If 
one is sick, then health can be obtained only by an 
accurate diagnosis of the malady and by appropriate 
treatment to overcome the disease. Moreover, the 
chances of success in diagnosis and treatment are better 
with a regular physician hi charge of the case. 

As regards the use of iron preparations in the treat- 
ment of anemia, there is accumulating evidence that the 
giving of iron is unscientific. The theory of Bunge, 1 

1 Hatcher, R. A., and Wilbert, M. J.: Pharmacology of Useful 
Drugs, American Medical Association, Chicago, 1915, p. 362. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 249 

that organic iron was more serviceable in anemia, is no 
longer held by pharmacologists, although urged valiantly 
by interested manufacturers of organic iron preparations. 
Recent experimental work at the George Williams Hooper 
Foundation for Medical Research by Whipple and Rob- 
scheit 1 shows that the usual iron preparations prescribed 
are inert so far as the effect on anemia was concerned, 
and that dietary treatment was at once helpful and 
constant in its effects. 

We are coming back in this instance as in so many 
other cases to look to suitable food, proper care of the 
body, and correct habits as more useful than drugs in 
rebuilding devitalized bodies. Potent drugs will always 
be invaluable help to the physician in the care of sick 
persons, but hygienic living is the foundation of all sane 
procedures for both well and sick.

concerned primarily in defending the body against a 
sudden attack of bacteria. They represent the Light 
Horse Cavalry of the blood, and when infection occurs 
they respond by a great increase in numbers, and an 
immediate mobilization at the site of the infection. 

The lymphocytes are concerned in protecting the body 
in the more chronic diseases, and their number is in- 
creased usually in the course of such diseases. 

The white cells are strengthened and made better 
soldiers for the protection of the body by means that 
increase the general health of the body. There is an 
increase in leukocytes in the blood after vigorous mus- 
cular exertion, cold baths, and massage. These measures 
tend in proper conditions to increase the general health 
and by increasing the number of leukocytes they increase 
the resistance to disease. In disease the count of these 
cells has important meaning. Experience shows that 
the higher the percentage of leukocytes, the severer the

fluencing Blood Regeneration Following Simple Anemia, Archives

infection, "while the body's resistance is mirrored in the 
height of the total leukocyte count." Measures for 
increasing the number of leukocytes and maintaining a 
high count are valuable in the maintenance of health. 
The measures concerned with improving the general 
health are the rules of hygienic living. 

Metchnikoff has pointed out the way in which the 
leukocytes destroy bacteria by eating them. He called 
this process "phagocytosis," and gave the name phago- 
cytes ("eating cells") to the leukocytes. In discussing 
the substances in the plasma the assistance rendered 
these cells by the opsonins will be described. 

It is not known just what part the platelets play in 
the blood (they are involved in coagulation), and hence 
no information can be given with reference to them. 

Plasma. The fluid part of the blood is the plasma. 
It is a straw-colored liquid. 

(a) Water. Ninety per cent, of the plasma is water. 
It serves to carry in solution the food-stuffs, salts, and 
waste substances. Its percentage in the blood remains 
fairly constant. When water is taken into the stomach 
it is absorbed either partly there or after it has passed 
into the intestines and colon. Whenever the percentage 
of water in the blood rises above a certain point it is 
eliminated from the blood by the kidneys. It may be 
retained in the tissues in large amounts in certain diseases 
when the kidneys and heart are affected, or when the 
tissues are loaded with salt due to the diminished power 
of excretion. 

Most people in health drink too little water rather 
than too much. In addition to the water taken in food, 
it is desirable to drink four glasses. This should be dis- 
tributed between meals and on rising in the morning 
and on retiring at night. The question of hot water and 
drinking at meal times was discussed in Chapter VII. 

(b) Gases. The presence of nitrogen in the plasma is 
of no importance. It is inert and plays no part in the 
function of the circulation. 



HYGIENE OP THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 25 1 

The carbon dioxid is a waste product of oxidation. 
It results from the combustion of food materials. The 
plasma carries it in solution and it is also found chemically 
combined with the alkali of the blood in the form of a 
bicarbonate. The fact that carbon dioxid, an acid, 
combines with an alkali is significant in that it indicates 
the way the body acts to keep the blood from developing 
acidity. Acidity of the blood develops in physical over- 
work, in certain kidney conditions in which the acid 
of the blood is not removed by the impaired kidney, 
and in heart and lung deficiencies in which the excess 
carbon dioxid is not removed rapidly enough. 

A competent heart and blood-vessels are most important 
in maintaining the proper condition of the blood, and an 
efficient respiratory system is necessary to remove the 
excess carbon dioxid as fast as it is produced. It is the 
height of folly to take measures to change the character 
of the blood when the difficulty lies in the condition 
of the digestive, circulatory, or respiratory apparatus. 

The oxygen is carried in the blood both in the plasma 
and in chemical combination with hemoglobin in the red 
blood-cells. As stated above, an adequate supply of 
hemoglobin is essential in transporting oxygen to the 
cells. There are a certain number of people who are 
living constantly below the level of their best, because 
they are unable to carry to their tissues the proper amount 
of oxygen needed. A series of examinations made on 
school teachers gives the following figures on morbidity 
as presented by Terman. 1 It should be noted that cir- 
culatory conditions are prominent in the types of illness 
presented, and although more prominent for women 
than men, are factors of importance distinctly related 
to the other diseases in the table shown on page 252.

The improvement in hemoglobin content following

vided is shown by the following figures:

Average gain 1 in hemoglobin in nine weeks = 7 points. 
Greatest gain in hemoglobin in nine weeks = 20 points. 

(c) Food-stuffs. Other important constituents of the 
plasma of the blood are the three groups of food-stuffs: car- 
bohydrate, fat, and protein. The blood and lymph streams 
are the only channels by which the food from the digestive 
tract can be transported to the outlying cells of the body. 
The character of the blood and its rapidity of movement 
are vital links in the whole matter of feeding the body. 
Its nourishing power is dependent upon the carbo- 
hydrates, fat, protein, and other substances present. 

1. Carbohydrates. Sugar is constantly in the blood 

in a proportion of 0.1 to 0.15 per cent. This amount 

is provided by the glycogen supply of the liver, and when 

during activity the muscles use up the sugar of the blood, 

1 Normal hemoglobin content of the blood is 100 per cent. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 253 

the liver at once supplies an amount sufficient to keep 
up the margin. The supply of glycogen under normal 
conditions is maintained chiefly by the carbohydrate food. 
If excessive amounts of sugar are eaten so that the liver 
cannot effectively store the amount ingested, the over- 
supply in the blood will be eliminated by the kidneys. 
There should be a balance between the supply of energy 
foods and the expenditure of energy. Practically, this 
means that if one eats large amounts of energy foods, 
one should engage vigorously in muscular work. Con- 
versely, if one works hard at physical labor, there is 
required sufficient energy foods to supply that expended. 
Any other arrangement will result either in loss of weight 
or increase of weight due to the oxidation of the cells 
of the body, on the one hand, or the storage of the surplus 
in the body cells on the other. 

2. Fat. Fat is digested in the intestine and broken 
up into fatty acid and glycerin. These two substances 
are absorbed, and after passing through the epithelium 
of the intestinal wall they are synthetized into fat of the 
form characteristic of the particular animal. It is found 
in the blood, therefore, as fat, and as such it is trans- 
ported to the cells. As absorbed it may serve different 
purposes. 

1. It may be at once oxidized and provide energy in the form of 

heat. 

2. It may be stored in the body cells as fat. 

3. It may be combined with other substances to form some com- 

plex constituent of the body, such as lecithin. 

4. It may be changed into sugar and serve the body in that way. 

The fat of the body as stated by Howell 1 ' 'originates 
partly from the fat of the food, particularly in carnivora, 
and partly from the carbohydrate of the food, especially 
in herbivora, in whose diet this food-stuff forms such a 
large part." 
There is a good deal of interest in the question of why 

1 Howell, W. H.: Text-book of Physiology, W. B. Saunders Co., 
Philadelphia, 1910, p. 877. 



254 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

some people become fat and others on similar diets fail 
to take on weight. Voit has stated that this difference 
is due to the varying capacity of individuals to destroy 
food materials in the body. When food is eaten, digested, 
and absorbed in excess of the energy requirements of 
the body, the excess is stored partly as glycogen in the 
liver, but chiefly as fat. Some people who eat a great 
deal of food are unable to completely digest or absorb 
sufficient amount to acquire an excess. Moreover, as 
Howell 1 states, "A diet which will give such an excess 
to one individual, may in the body of another of the 
same weight be all consumed." Differences of this 
kind are frequently inherited. Individuals who have 
little tendency to lay up a store of fat may be made 
to do so by increasing the amount of fat and carbohydrate 
in the food and by changing the mode of life. Individuals 
who worry, who expend large amounts of energy in fret- 
ting and aimless movements do not store fat easily. 
Unless the thinness of the individual is marked, there 
should be no desire to lay up a store of fat. It is so much 
extra weight to carry and is valuable only as an indication 
that nutritional processes are active and pronounced. 
Fat on the body is like money in the bank without interest. 
It pays no dividends and should not be sought for its 
own sake. The hygiene of living that makes possible 
the deposition of fat may be very desirable, but fat 
itself is of no particular import except for those under- 
weight. The role of fat in such cases seems to be that 
of a reserve food supply. 

3. Protein. The protein of the blood exists in three 
forms serum albumin, serum globulin, and fibrinogen. 
The history of protein in the body is uncertain and 
not as yet clear. Whether or not in the process of diges- 
tion the complex protein molecule is split into its final 
divisions, the amino-acids, and then built up from these 
units into more complex body proteins, has been a source 
of some discussion and much investigation. We are 
1 Howell, W. H.: Loc. cit., p. 879. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 255 

not at all certain just what goes on. It has been shown 
in numerous experiments that proteins have a specific 
"dynamic action" in the body in that they facilitate the 
building-up processes of the body to a greater extent 
than do fats or carbohydrates. 1 For the growing child 
proteins are more essential than for the adult. The 
tendency of the day is for people of adult years to eat 
less meat and obtain the protein necessary from vegetables. 

(d) Salts of the Blood. In addition to the water, gases, 
and food-stuffs, the plasma of the blood contains im- 
portant salts. They serve a variety of functions. The 
inorganic salts of the blood are valuable in maintaining 
normal osmotic pressure in the tissues of the body and 
in some way are combined in the chemical composition 
of the cells, and are necessary to normal action by the 
cells. The salts of calcium are important in the coagula- 
tion of the blood and the curdling of milk, and the sodium, 
calcium, and magnesium play a useful part in the con- 
traction of the heart and the irritability of muscular and 
nervous tissue. The part played by the iron salts in the 
production of hemoglobin has been described. 

1. Special Considerations. It is estimated that the 
average man takes with his food from 10 to 20 grams 2 
of salt in the form of sodium chlorid a day. This is in 
excess of the needs of the body because one may keep 
in good health with only 1 to 2 grams in the diet. Bunge 
has shown that men and animals living on a pure meat 
diet evince no desire for salt in addition to that in the 
food, but on a vegetable diet there is an intense craving 
for salt. This is due to the fact that vegetables are rich 
in potassium salts which combine with the available 
sodium chlorid, giving potassium chlorid and sodium 
sulphate. One may eat too much salt in the food; there 
is no danger in eating too little, if the proper selection 
of foods is made.

There is reason to believe that the abnormal enlarge- 
ment of the thyroid gland may be due to the absence 
or presence of certain salts in the diet, because of the 
geographic distribution of many cases. 1 Goiter may 
show at puberty, but it usually is temporary. The thyroid 
also may enlarge at the menstrual period. The pubertal 
and adolescent enlargements of the thyroid are usually 
without significance. 

The importance of habitat in connection with the 
development of goiter is given by Osier 2 as follows: 

"Goiter, on the whole, is rare in the United States; it is perhaps 
most common in the region of the Great Lakes. In an investigation 
in Michigan Dock found a large number of cases, and the disease is 
not very uncommon in lower Canada. In England it is common in 
certain regions: the Thames valley, the Dales, Derbyshire, Sussex, 
and Hampshire. It is very prevalent about Oxford and the upper 
Thames valley. In Switzerland, in the mountains of Germany and 
Austria, the mountainous districts of France, and in the Pyrenees 
the disease is very prevalent. In the regions of Central Asia, in the 
Abyssinian Mountains, and in the Himalayas there are many foci 
of the disease." 

The cause of the disease is not clearly known, but 
there is considerable evidence to indicate that the char- 
acter of the water drunk may have something to do 
with its occurrence. On this point Osier 3 says: 

"The water in goitrous districts is hard, rich in lime and magnesia, 
poor in iodin, and (so Redin affirms of the Swiss waters) with a 
high degree of radio-activity. Others speak of a 'miasma' of the 
soil that gets into the drinking-water. McCarrison in Kashmir 
found that the specific agent could be killed by boiling the water and 
that it did not pass a Berkefeld filter. He produced goiter in himself 
and others by the daily consumption of the residue of the filter, 
but the residue when boiled was harmless. The disease was trans- 
mitted to goats who drank water contaminated by goiter patients. 
There are 'goiter springs' and 'goiter wells.' "

Irritation of the gland by clothing has been given 
as a cause. 

Whether the salts found in certain waters cause this 
disease, or whether the cause is bacterial or parasitic, 
or whether pressure is a causative factor, is open to 
question the exact cause is unknown. With the avail- 
able evidence, it is clear that the prevention of goiter 
lies in elimination of the factors under suspicion. Per- 
sons in predisposed families should leave goiter districts 
and live in healthy localities. The drinking-water in 
suspected areas should be boiled, for experimental evi- 
dence indicates that the "cause" may be destroyed by 
boiling. Tight collars should be avoided, especially 
by those suffering any thyroid enlargement. 

2. Use of Mineral Waters. Mineral waters are con- 
sidered valuable in the treatment of certain diseases, 
but much of their supposed value lies in the comfort- 
able surroundings, the outdoor activities, the exercise, 
the baths all are important factors. Consequently, 
the use of mineral water away from the health resort 
is frequently disappointing. Persons in good health 
do not require special waters; persons with disease should 
consult a physician. 

The use of spring water in cities is not demanded on 
health grounds unless the city water-supply is contami- 
nated. 

The commercial exploitation of mineral waters has 
led to many fantastic health claims. The following 
account of Buffalo Lithia Water is illustrative of many 
"waters" that are supposed to have mysterious or un- 
usual virtues in curing disease. The expose given here 
appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Associa- 
tion and has been reprinted in a pamphlet, "Mineral 
Waters," 1 describing a large number of fraudulently 
advertised waters:

Buffalo Lithia Water.-^-Some years ago Alexander Haig evolved 
the theory that most diseases are due to uric acid. The data on 
which he founded his theory were not corroborated by scientific 
men, and investigation showed that his methods were unreliable. 
In spite of the fact that Haig's theories are utterly discredited, and 
have been for years, the uric acid fallacy still persists, although it is 
now largely confined to the public. Shrewd business men, especially 
those who are more intent on making money than they are concerned 
with the manner in which that money is made, owe much to Haig's 
theory. As a business .proposition, uric acid has been one of the 
best-paying fallacies on the market and possibly still is.

Fig. 27. Showing how "Buffalo Lithia Water" in the course of 
time became "Buffalo Lithia Springs Water." The government has 
shown that, to obtain a therapeutic dose of lithium from Buffalo 
Lithia Springs Water, it would be necessary to drink 200,000 gallons 
of the water. The government also declared that Potomac River 
water contained five times as much lithium as does Buffalo Lithia 
Springs Water. 

Contemporary with, and to a certain extent a corollary of, the 
uric acid fallacy was another, viz., that lithium would eliminate 
uric acid. This at once gave a good working principle for the pro- 
prietary men. Uric acid, we were told, causes disease; lithium, we 
were also told, would eliminate uric acid; therefore, lithium is the 
new elixir of life! Could anything be simpler? 

Accepting this theory, it was inevitable that mineral waters con- 
taining lithium salts should become highly popular. Many ex- 
E loiters of mineral waters began to place most emphasis on the 
thium salts in their waters even in those cases in which lithium was 
present in such infinitesimal amounts as to render its detection im- 
possible by any but spectroscopic methods. 

One of the best known, because most widely advertised, of the 
so-called lithia waters is Buffalo Lithia Water or what used to be 
called Buffalo Lithia Water. After the Federal Food and Drugs 
Act came into effect, by which falsification on the label was pen- 
alized, the name of Buffalo Lithia Water was changed to Buffalo 
Lithia Springs Water. When Buffalo Lithia Water was subjected 
to examination by the government chemists it was found to contain 
so little lithium that the amount present was unweighable it could 
be demonstrated only by the spectroscope. It was evidently, 
therefore, not a lithia water in that it did not contain at least in 
quantities that could be consumed an amount of lithium that would 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 259 

give the therapeutic effects of lithium. Possibly the company im- 
agined that by changing the name from "Buffalo Lithia Water" to 
"Buffalo Lithia Springs Water" it had cleverly evaded the federal 
law. Their argument, apparently, was to this effect: The springs 
from which this water is taken are known as Buffalo Lithia Springs; 
therefore, it is not a misstatement of facts to call this Buffalo Lithia 
Springs Water. 

WHAT IS A LITHIA WATER? 

The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, holding a district 
court, has recently given an opinion on the Buffalo Lithia Springs 
Water case. The findings of the court are refreshingly simple, and 
characterized by that broad common-sense view that is becoming in- 
creasingly more common among modern jurists. Read Judge Gould's 
opinion as to what constitutes a lithia water: 

"Speaking generally, and as an individual of average intelligence 
and information, it would seem that if one were offered a water 
which the vendor told him was a 'lithia' water, one would have the 
right to expect enough lithium in the water to justify its charac- 
terization as such, thus differentiating it from ordinary potable 
water; and this amount would reasonably be expected to have some 
effect on the consumer of the water by reason of the presence of the 
lithium." 

Certainly a reasonable attitude, and one which the man in the 
street not only can understand but will agree with. Then came the 
question as to the actual lithium content of Buffalo Lithia Springs 
Water, and the court said : 

"For a person to obtain a therapeutic dose of lithium by drinking 
Buffalo Lithia Water he would have to drink from 150,000 to 225,000 
gallons of water per day. It was further testified, without con- 
tradiction, that Potomac River water contains five times as much 
lithium per gallon as the water in controversy." 

(e) Protective Substances. In addition to the water, 
gases, food-stuffs, and salts, there are protective sub- 
stances in the blood, serving to save the body from the 
ravages of disease. This fact has been known for some 
time. About forty years ago Traube showed that if a 
small quantity of putrefying material was added to 
fresh blood, the blood possessed the power of retaining 
its normal condition, and this experiment raised the 
question whether the protective power of the blood 
resided in the plasma or in the blood-cells. Buchner 
named the germicidal constituents of the plasma "alexins" 
(defenders). 

Metchnikoff was the first to emphasize the importance 
of the blood-cells, and he showed how the white cells 



260 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

of the blood swallowed and destroyed the bacteria. 
The phagocyte is not always able to win the fight with 
the bacteria, and if weakened by unhygienic living or 
disease, or attacked by bacteria either more powerful 
or more numerous than usual, the phagocytes them- 
selves may be overcome in the contest. 

It is also known that there are in the plasma certain 
substances that make it possible for the phagocytes to 
more readily attack bacteria. These substances are 
called "opsonins," meaning "to buy victuals." It is 
not known just how they are formed nor what increases 
their quantity, but it is known that when these sub- 
stances are abundant, the phagocytes are able to devour 
large quantities of bacteria; that when these substances 
are deficient the phagocytes feed less readily upon the 
bacteria. 

There are other protective substances in the blood, 
probably in the plasma. The story of the scientific 
experiments that have been laboriously performed to 
determine these secrets of the blood is too long to be 
told here. It is a story of great adventure and great 
achievement. 

It is a well-known fact that persons are protected 
from recurring attacks of a disease once experienced. 
Most of the communicable diseases, scarlet fever, measles, 
diphtheria, typhoid, are, as a rule, capable of infecting 
the same individual only once. 

The protection afforded to the individual by an attack 
of a disease is called "immunity" and is due in part 
to certain substances developed in the blood in the 
course of the disease and called by the name "anti- 
bodies." By this is meant that these substances have 
the power of exerting adverse ("anti" against) action 
against the invading- bacteria. A description of these 
antibodies and the general character of them is so well 
given by Evans 1 that he is quoted in detail on this point: 

1 Evans, W.: Medical Science of Today, Seeley, Service & Co., 
London, 1912, pp. 89, 90. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCtTLATORY SYSTEM 26 1 

"Many animals secrete poisonous substances which they can, at 
will, inject into their enemies, and these poisons are called "venoms." 
Poisonous snakes, scorpions, some spiders, toads, and salamanders 
may be mentioned as examples. In the venoms formed by these 
animals there are no germs, but they contain chemical substances, 
most of which are of extreme virulence. Some snake venoms are 
so potent that it has been calculated that a quarter of a drop is 
sufficient to prove fatal to a man within a short time. We may 
compare such a venom to the toxine produced by bacteria and it 
will be instructive to consider how an antidote to snake venom can 
be obtained. It does not appear that the animals that habitually 
attack snakes, such as the mongoose and the secretary-bird, possess 
any natural antibodies so that they might be bitten with impunity, 
for they seem to depend for their safety on their agility. If a series 
of very small quantity of snake venom (very, very much less than 
would prove fatal) be injected at intervals into an animal, such as a 
horse, it will be found after a time, that when a poisonous dose is 
subsequently administered, the animal does not die, and in fact 
seems none the worse for the dose that would have killed it, if it 
had not been protected. This immunity is found to be due to certain 
substances, 'antibodies' as we may term them, in the blood of the 
animal, and if some of the animal's blood be obtained and the liquid 
part, or 'serum,' separated from the corpuscles and the clot, 'anti- 
venom' serum, as it is called, is obtained. The action of the antivenpm 
on the venom appears to be purely chemical, the two neutralizing 
each other, as do an acid and an alkali in a test-tube. If a suitable 
quantity of antivenom be mixed with a poisonous dose of snake 
venom and the mixture be injected into an unprotected animal, no 
harmful result follows. Again, if a suitable amount of antivenom 
serum be injected into an animal and then later a poisonous dose of 
venom be injected, no symptoms are caused, for the antivenom 
already in the body of the animal has neutralized the venom sub- 
sequently injected. Nay, more, if a poisonous dose of venom be in- 
jected into an animal, and then soon after the correct amount of 
antivenom be injected in this case also the animal survives un- 
harmed. But it is absolutely essential that the interval between the 
injection of the poison and its antidote should not be too long. If 
the dose of poison is such that would naturally kill the animal in 
three hours, the antidote must be given not later than one hour 
after the poison." 

This explanation of the nature of antibodies may be 
added to from a description by Vaughan, 1 who says: 

"Immunity due to bactericidal constituents of the blood, whether 
it be natural or acquired, is always relative. Even the immunity 
secured by one attack of the disease may be overcome, in most in- 
stances at least, by the administration of an overwhelming dose of 

1 Vaughan, V. C. : Infection and Immunity, Commemoration 
Volume, American Medical Association, Chicago, 1915, pp. 152, 153. 



262 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

the virus in virulent form. ... A highly germicidal blood is of 
great value in preventing infection, because the first few organisms 
that find their way into the body are promptly killed before they 
can multiply and while the amount of poison set free is too small to 
produce any marked effect." 

In another place he says: 

"Normal blood and the serum obtained from it contain non- 
specific, bactericidal ferments or enzymes. In normal blood these 
enzymes are not specific and they display marked, distinctive action 
on certain bacteria, and are wholly without effect with others." 

There is, then, normal serum containing general pro- 
tective agents, and immune serum containing specific 
defenders against specific diseases. This Vaughan makes 
clear when he says: "The essential difference between 
the germicidal constituent of normal serum and that of 
immune serum is that the latter is specific, while the 
former is not." Normal serum may be made immune 
by inoculation or vaccination for certain diseases, e. g., 
smallpox, typhoid. 

The process of preparing an antisubstance for cer- 
tain diseases has developed rapidly in recent years. 
The different serums used so effectively in the treat- 
ment of certain diseases are founded upon this knowl- 
edge of the protective nature of normal serum and immune 
serum. The aim of medical science in the use of immune 
serums of other animals for treatment of disease in man 
is to assist the blood by injecting into it antibodies that 
have been formed usually in the body of another animal. 

It is to be remembered that the blood normally con- 
tains substances that have the definite power of destroy- 
ing the poisons of certain bacteria. It would be valu- 
able to know just how far hygienic living serves to in- 
crease the formation and powers of these antibodies. 
The exact significance of this is not known, but it has 
been abundantly demonstrated that there is a very close 
relation between vigorous health and resistance to in- 
fection and disease, and this increased power of resistance 
probably develops through an increase in strength in

the protective substances of the plasma. The drunkard, 
the chronically fatigued, the soft liver, and the high 
feeder these are types that show a weakened resistance 
to infection. 1 The vigorous outdoor type of man and 
woman, active in exercise, healthy in habits, and exact 
in body care, promises more in high resistance to infec- 
tion than the indoor sedentary type of unhygienic habits 
and unwholesome attitudes for living. 

(/) Autacoids. The water, gases, food-stuffs, salts, and 
protective substances make the plasma appear exceed- 
ingly complex. There are still other important con- 
stituents, namely, the secretions of certain glands giving 
their products directly into the blood-stream. It is 
generally well known that a gland is a group of cells 
that produce and pour out a secretion upon some sur- 
face of the body. The sweat glands, the salivary, the 
gastric glands are familiar examples. These secretions 
are carried from the gland by a duct or canal-like passage. 
There are other glands that have no ducts and are, there- 
fore, called ductless glands. Glands with this structure 
are the thyroid in the neck, the thymus which lies above 
the heart and disappears during puberty, the supra- 
renals above the kidneys, the pituitary gland at the 
base of the brain, certain parts of the ovaries, and the 
testicles. It has been ascertained that these glands 
true to their structure provide a secretion, but instead 

1 It is not always true that the strong and vigorous endure disease 
better than the weak. In some diseases the strong man apparently 
succumbs most readily, due to the fact that his metabolic activity 
is more rapid and the poison set free by bacteria in the body is broken 
up to exert its influence more effectively on the strong than on one 
whose metabolism was slower and less thorough. To support the 
view that the strong at times more readily succumb to infections 
than the weak, Vaughan quotes Boghursts' account of the plague in 
London in 1665: 

"Of all the common hackney prostitutes of Luteners-lane, dog- 
yard, cross-lane, Baldwins-gardens, Hatton-gardens, and other, 
places, the common criers of oranges, oysters, fruits, etc., all the im- 
pudent drunken, drubbing bayles and fellows and many others of 
the rouge route, there is but few missing verifying the testimony of 
Diemerbroech that the plague left the rotten bodies and took the 
sound." 



264 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

of this being given to the body in the usual way, it is 
poured directly into the blood. It is further known 
that some of these glands are more active under emotional 
excitement. " The active principles of this secretion have 
been called autacoids, meaning self-remedy. Autacoids 
that stimulate are called hormones, those that inhibit, 
chalones." 

From the earliest times there has been a practice to 
assign certain virtues to certain organs of the body and 
especially in the treatment of disease of the same organs. 
Thus it is that the works of Celsus and Dioscorides 
advocate the giving of organs from animals for the treat- 
ment of disease of the same organs in man. Savage 
man in the belief that bravery was a matter of the heart 
cultivated the custom of eating the hearts of his enemies 
which he had slain in order to increase his own courage. 
Throughout the eighteenth century "the lung of the fox 
was advised for shortness of breath, for the fox is able to 
run long distances at a high speed; the brain of the hare 
for tremors, and rennet for disordesr of the stomach." 

Very little has ever been determined 1 concerning the 
ways in which man can utilize the internal secretions 
so as to enable him to live more effectively, but there 
are a few indications that emphasize the avoidance of 
certain acts in order to preserve his health with reference 
to the way in which these glands operate. 

The thyroid in the neck usually enlarges during puberty, 
but this seems to be physiologic, and with proper living 
no untoward results occur. Lack of development of 
the thyroid in children may be compensated very largely 
by internal administration of thyroid extract, a prepara- 
tion made usually from the gland of a sheep. 

The secretions of the pituitary gland, the thymus, 
and the suprarenals are very important especially in mat- 

1 The use of animal extracts of the glands of internal secretions has 
grown rapidly of late. Endocrinology has not progressed far enough 
for the impartial observer to advise with any assurance concerning 
general matters or general principles. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 265 

ters of growth and development, but we have no definite 
knowledge of the way in which care and attention of the 
body may influence the glands in a direct way. 

The secretions from the ovaries and testicles are so 
important that they make the characters that mark 
the female, on the one hand, and the male on the other; 
they are essential to the development of the most vigorous 
type of manhood and womanhood. It is most important 
for women to avoid gonorrhea because this disease fre- 
quently invades the ovaries, requiring removal of the 
diseased organs. Serious disturbance of health often 
follows the artificial menopause produced. 

(g) Waste Substances in Plasma. Even as in a fire in 
the furnace there are ashes of the combustion, so in the 
body there are substances left by the process of chemical 
reaction. These waste materials are called end-products, 
waste substances, or fatigue products. The waste from 
fats and carbohydrates is chiefly in the form of carbon 
dioxid and water; that from protein is more complex 
and consists chiefly of the following: urea, uric acid, 
and creatin. 

The waste as it is formed in the cells of the body is 
gradually extruded into the lymph spaces of the tissues, 
and thence finds its way into the circulating blood. The 
rapidity with which this waste is removed is a good 
index of the efficiency of the circulation, and a rapid 
removal is essential for the best and most vigorous 
health. 

There is definite knowledge available regarding the 
things that tend to increase the amount of waste, and 
that help in the removal of the excess. It is very im- 
portant to keep the body as free as possible from sub- 
stances that are in their very nature poisonous. 

Use of food in greater amounts than is required by the 
body probably results in the same type of reaction in 
the body as occurs in the furnace when too much fuel 
is thrown upon the fire. The combustion in each case 
is partial and incomplete. Any undue amount of waste 



266 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

must be removed in order to secure any really effective 
combustion at all. Now the waste from fat and sugar 
is simple and resembles the smoke of a fire; it is readily 
removed. The waste from protein is complex and re- 
sembles the clinkers of the furnace in its more complex 
character and especially in its difficulty of removal. 
So that, to reduce unnecessary waste and to secure most 
complete combustion one will not overeat, and especially 
one will not eat many nucleoproteins, because they 
give rise to the purin bases. 

To secure efficiency in the handling of food in the 
body, the processes of digestion, absorption, and assimila- 
tion should go on in an orderly, economical, and rapid 
manner; such action is impeded by overeating and 
especially the overeating of meat. 

It is important to so live that unnecessary waste is 
not produced; that the elimination of waste from the 
cells and tissues will at all times be facilitated and not 
retarded. Exercise, especially of the out-of-door variety, 
is absolutely essential in this respect. The contractions 
of the muscles aid the removal of waste from the tissue 
spaces, move the lymph along to the heart, and stimulate 
the complete combustion of food materials. 

One so often hears persons speak of the blood as being 
"bad," and especially in the spring of the year are some 
inclined to think of the blood as being in a "bad condi- 
tion." Only recently a student of medicine came to my 
office to consult me regarding a pronounced case of acne 
(pimples) occurring chiefly on the back and shoulders. 
He thought his blood was "bad" and his general feeling 
of unfitness he attributed to the same cause. 

A simple word picture of this youth and his mode of 
living tells the story. He was accustomed to bathe once 
a week or in a fortnight, and the condition of his skin, 
as shown both by the sense of sight and the sense of 
smell, confirmed his history. His teeth were dirty, and 
he said that he "brushed them once in a while." He 
took no exercise at all aside from that involved in walking 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 267 

a half mile to school and home again at night. He was 
studying disease for the purpose of curing other people, 
and yet his whole body was a fit subject for clinical study 
in how not to care for the body. It was perfectly clear 
that the "badness" in his blood arose from his bad habits 
of eating, his lack of exercise, and his total lack of the 
most simple and elemental care of the body. All the 
pills and medicines in the world, baskets of sulphur 
burned in his room or in his body, would not bring "good- 
ness" to his blood. The waste products of his body, 
the clinkers of the furnace, must first be removed before 
any improvement in his skin could be noted. 

The reason why persons so often speak of "bad blood' 
as accompanying the opening of spring is because one 
so often sees people who have lived the most unhygienic 
lives during the winter cooping themselves up in a 
hot and ill-ventilated house, overeating, and generally 
abstaining from bathing because of the inclemency of 
the weather. When people learn to eat moderately, to 
exercise regularly in the open whenever possible, to live 
in well-ventilated rooms, and to keep the body in all 
parts scrupulously clean, then, and then only, will the 
question of "bad" blood be removed. Pimples, blotches, 
cold sores, eczema, 1 and many skin disturbances are 
often expressions of bad living. God in his wisdom was 
not visiting our student with punishments, as was once 
believed; he was merely paying the price of living poorly 
and at a low level. 

The "patent medicine" interests would have people 
believe that "good" blood depends upon medicine. Tak- 
ing sarsaparilla in the spring will not "purify" the blood. 
The only reliable procedure for purifying the blood is 
by removing the waste. This may be done by exercising, 
especially in the open air, and by lightening the diet.

tein sensitization. See The Value of Cutaneous Sensitization Tests

In the diet one should avoid especially pastries, sweets, 
greasy foods, all alcohol, and much meat, and should 
partake of fresh fruits, green vegetables, coarse whole 
cereals, pure milk, eggs, and a little meat. 

The Vessels. The vessels of the circulation have 
been compared to the water mains of a city, but the 
likeness is in form only. In structure they are very 
unlike. The arteries are elastic vessels, the veins are 
collapsible tubes with valves. 

The elasticity of the arteries permits them to stretch 
and respond to the changing demands of pressure in the 
circulation. This quality provides a very adjustable 
mechanism especially useful during increased physical 
activity. 

The Arteries. Loss of elasticity in the arteries results 
in a condition known as arteriosclerosis. This may 
develop in early adult life or come only in old age. The 
cause or causes are not known. Age alone cannot be 
regarded as a cause because of the possible factors extend- 
ing over many years. Moreover, the condition has been 
found in children. 

MacCollum 1 gives an excellent summary of the knowl- 
edge of this condition and notes six main points around 
which fall the experimental and clinical evidence: 

1. Hereditary tendencies have been emphasized by 

numerous workers. Osier 2 has called attention 
to the fact that one may inherit elastic tissue of 
poor quality in precisely the same way that one 
may inherit defective nervous tissue. 

2. Hard muscular work has been cited often as a factor. 

As a condition it is always complicated by the 
varying standards of personal hygiene. Syphilis 
and other infections, abuse of alcohol and -tobacco, 
toxins, and metallic poisons in certain trades 
expose the worker to possible causes.

70-91. 

Osier, W.: Modern Medicine, 1915, p. 453. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 269 

3. High blood-pressure as a cause plays a contradictory 

role. Numerous authors cite "mental activity 
or overactivity, mental diseases, and various 
nervous disturbances" as possible factors in 
arteriosclerosis. Others mention diabetes, chronic 
nephritis, and obesity as causes. 

4. Infections, intoxications, and unbalanced diets are 

probably the most important causative factors. 
Ophuls shows in an excellent review that arterio- 
sclerosis is related definitely to infections, especially 
the chronic infections of the rheumatic type. 

5. Intoxications of alcohol, tobacco, lead, and intestinal 

poisons (constipation) have been popularly as- 
signed as causes. The general statements have 
not been substantiated by workers in this field. 

6. Unbalanced diet seems to be a factor, at least in the 

experiments with lower animals. Experiments 
with rabbits seem to show that animal food in 
the diet of the vegetarian rabbit does cause 
modification in the arterial wall. The relation 
of this to man, however, is not so clear. 
These various causes may be regrouped under two 
headings: poisons and overwork. The former would 
include the infections and the intoxications; the latter 
would include physical, mental, and gastric overwork. 
Extreme physical labor, prolonged for years, continuous 
overwork in mental tasks, overwork of the gastro-intestinal 
tract, with or without proper diet, suggest that an im- 
portant phase of the problem is social adjustment. 

One needs to get a true perspective to evade the dangers 
of modern life. To live the temperate life temperate 
in all things, in work, in play, in mental endeavor, in 
eating and in drinking is to see straight and keep values 
clear. Osier advises to "shun Bacchus and Venus," 
and the disasters that come from sharing company with 
those imposters may be avoided. 

The Veins. The arteries are more easily injured, and 
yet the veins suffer change that interferes with the activity 



270 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

of the individual at times. The veins are concerned 
with carrying blood from the tissues back to the heart, 
and, therefore, should not be obstructed in any way in 
the performance of that work. Valves in the course 
of the veins prevent the backward flow that would other- 
wise result in a system under such low pressure and 
in part working against gravity. Muscular activity 
is very important in assisting the onward flow of blood 
in the veins. 

One needs to be guided by two principles in preserving 
the normal condition of the veins exercise that will 
give assistance to the return of blood to the heart, and 
freedom of the venous return flow by not wearing tight 
bands, tight garters, tight collars, or tight corsets. The 
body should be as unhampered by clothing as it can be. 

Varicose Veins. Varicose veins are broken-down ves- 
sels in which the valves and walls have given away 
resulting in slowing of the circulation in the part in- 
volved. Varicosities result from a variety of causes. 1 
Prominent in their production is obstruction at some 
point between the varicosity and the heart. This may 
be due to a thrombosis (inflammation of the wall of the 
vein with clot formation), pressure on the vein from 
without, as in tumor growth or pregnancy, or to struc- 
tural change in the liver preventing an unimpeded return 
of blood to the heart. Aside from obstruction it is known 
that occupation influences the condition. Prolonged 
standing with its accompanying congestion in the legs 
accounts for certain cases. It is commonly known that 
motormen suffer from varicose veins, while postmen 
are peculiarly free from the condition. Athletes engaging 
in pole vaulting and high jumping at times develop 
varicosities, due apparently to the effect of landing on 
the feet violently. The influence of obstructing bands,

iricose veins among tall persons. See Statistics, vol. xv, Part I,

such as garters, corsets, and belts, is probably also im- 
portant in many cases. 

Mild cases of varicose veins require no special treat- 
ment. Surgery is often required when supportive treat- 
ment by elastic stockings is not effective. 

The Heart. The blood, vessels, and pump were noted 
as the chief elements in the circulation. The constituents 
of the blood may be normal, the vessels elastic and effi- 
cient, and yet, if the pump is unable effectively to do the 
work of pushing the blood to the tissues and forcing back 
the venous blood, the efficiency of the scheme is gone. 

The heart is made up of muscle and divided into four 
chambers that are connected with each other through 
valves and vessels. Now, as a pump, it is dependent 
upon two factors: the valves must fit tightly and work 
properly, and the muscle of the heart wall must be strong 
and controlled enough to produce a vigorous heart im- 
pulse. Injury to the valves of the heart or to the heart 
muscle itself not infrequently occurs. The valves are 
delicate little leaves that are easily injured by certain 
forces; the heart muscle is supplied with blood exactly 
as are the other muscles of the body and has endurance 
or lacks it precisely as other muscles do. It is just as 
dependent upon good food as the other parts of the 
body, and its importance is fundamental because of the 
dependency of other organs upon the circulation. Alcohol, 
tobacco, or poisons from disease in the body may ruin 
a heart just as bad oil will ruin an engine. In many 
ways it is helpful to think of the heart as a little motor 
pumping about 10 tons of blood a day a tidy job for a 
10-ounce motor. 

Injury to the Valves. The valves are most frequently 
injured by infectious disease. The bacteria that may 
gain access to the blood at the time scar and destroy 
the shape of the valves, and prevent them from effectively 
controlling the blood in the proper chambers of the heart. 
The following communicable diseases are most important 
in this respect and, therefore, should be avoided as far 



272 



PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 



as possible: acute rheumatic fever (rheumatism), scarlet 
fever, tonsillitis, syphilis, and pneumonia. Infected 
teeth are also important as a cause of injury to the heart 
because they serve frequently as the gateway through 
which the organism that causes rheumatism enters the 
body.

York school children, shows the prevalence of certain

It is with regret that one finds parents so often with- 
out appreciation of the danger to the child of having the 
so-called "children's diseases." It should be emphatically 
stated that these diseases do not belong to children at 
all and should never be contracted unless absolutely 

1 Halsey, R. H. : Heart Disease in Children of School Age, Journal 
American Medical Association, August 27, 1921, p. 672. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 273 

unavoidable. A child of eight years recently seen in the 
hospital gave a history of having had scarlet fever, 
pneumonia, neuritis, measles, whooping-cough, chicken- 
pox, mumps, tonsillitis. Her heart was badly damaged. 
This was to be expected as a result of the infections she 
had experienced. 

Injury to the Muscles. For years many have felt that 
athletics injure the heart because of the intense strain 
on the circulation in athletic contests. Opinions are 
rapidly changing in this respect today, and most workers 
in this field are saying that the heart is not injured in 
the performances of athletic events unless there exists 
at the time of the participation an infection. Mackenzie, 
of England, than whom there is no greater authority 
on the heart, takes this position. If the tonsils or teeth 
are infected, or if a focus of infection is present anywhere 
in the body, vigorous exercise is not desirable. One 
who has a normal heart may engage freely in exercise 
if the body is free from infection. 

The influence of pre-existing disease, metallic poisons, 
and emotional excitement are mentioned by Phipps 1 as 
important for those engaged in physical occupations. 
Emotional excitement will not injure the muscle, but the 
first two will. Phipps says: "Trauma and muscular 
strain damage the tonicity or contractility, or produce 
an acute dilatation, when there is pre-existing disease; 
metallic or bacterial poisons may cause or aggravate 
lesions of the muscle, valves, or innervation; emotional 
stress may upset the normal rhythm." 

The Convalescent Heart. After a prolonged sickness 
or an operation the heart is weakened because of two 
factors: the poisons from the disease and the inactivity 
of the body. During and following an attack of rheu- 
matism or tonsillitis the heart is very liable to injury. 
Complete rest in bed during the disease and very gradual 
activity afterward are important. No one can afford 

1 Phipps, C. : Heart Disease in Industry, Journal American 
Medical Association, February 25, 1922, p. 562. 
18 



274 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

needlessly to endanger the heart; it is too vital an organ. 
Remembering that the heart is a muscle, it will be easy 
to comprehend how inactivity weakens the heart by 
comparing the effects of non-use of the skeletal muscles. 
Therefore, after a period of illness in bed, the individual 
should begin, gradually, an active life. A sudden exer- 
tion before the heart has been strengthened by exercise 
may result disastrously. 

The Influence of Poisons Upon the Heart. The 
practice by the laity of using certain drugs for colds 
and headaches is distinctly dangerous because of the 
injury to the heart. Most headache remedies depend 
for their effectiveness upon acetanilid. Acetanilid, 
antipyrin, and phenacetin are drugs made from coal- 
tar. They have a definite depressing effect upon the 
heart muscle. They should not be used indiscriminately. 
They are dangerous, and yet there are on the market 
hundreds of so-called headache and cold cures, labeled 
"absolutely safe," that depend for their effect on ace- 
tanilid. Aspirin, widely advertised as a remedy for 
colds, headaches, and pain in general, is not without 
danger to the heart. Self-diagnosis and self-treatment 
of disease are unscientific and should not be undertaken 
by one who aims to achieve for himself the best in the 
way of living. Simple disorders requiring home remedies 
and home care may, of course, be handled without medical 
aid. Disorders, however, that require drugs should have 
scientific and intelligent diagnosis and therapy. Only 
a reputable physician can give this. 

The Influence of Tobacco. Tobacco presents to the 
lay mind a moral question. It is usually discussed on 
that basis by the opponents of its use. It is more rational 
to discuss it as a health question. Its effect on health 
and particularly its effect on the heart has been a matter 
of fact for some time. 

Investigations carried out on healthy men and on men 
suffering from "soldier's heart" by Parkinson and Koefod 1 
1 The Lancet, August 18, 1917, vol. cxciii, No. 4903, p. 232. 



HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 275 

showed the following immediate effects of cigarette 
smoking on such individuals: 

"1. The immediate effect of cigarette smoking upon the 
circulatory system and upon the breathlessness 
of exertion was observed in 30 smokers, of 
whom 20 were men affected with ' 'soldier's 
heart" and 10 were healthy soldiers. Each 
subject smoked either four or five cigarettes 
during a period of forty minutes. 

"2. A demonstrable effect was recorded in 17 of the 
20 patients; the 3 unaffected were non-inhalers. 
Nine of the 10 controls, all inhalers, were in- 
fluenced in the same fashion, though not to the 
same degree. 

"3. The average pulse-rate among the patients during 
smoking was nine beats higher than before smok- 
ing; in the healthy controls it was six higher. 
Initial slowing of the heart was never observed, 
nor any irregularity referable to smoking. 

"4. The rate of respiration in the patients was un- 
affected; in the controls it was slightly reduced. 

"5. The average systolic blood-pressure was raised 
by 5 to 10 mm. Hg., and the diastolic by 5 mm., 
both in patients and controls. 

"6. These effects appeared within five minutes; with 
the first cigarette they almost reached the 
maximum, and this was maintained throughout 
the smoking period. 

"7. A simple exertion test was performed before smok- 
ing and repeated on its cessation. In the 
patients the pulse-rate maintained a higher 
level throughout the test after smoking, and 
half of them were more breathless both sub- 
jectively and objectively. In 2 patients pre- 
cordial pain was induced by smoking, apart 
from exertion. But in the controls the pulse- 
rate curve during exertion was much the same 
after smoking as before, and breathlessness was 
induced in 2 only. 



276 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

"8. These observations show that, in health, the 
smoking of a single cigarette by an habitual 
smoker usually raises the pulse-rate and blood- 
pressure perceptibly; and these effects are a 
little more pronounced in cases of "soldier's 
heart." Moreover, the smoking of a few cigar- 
ettes can render healthy men more breathless 
on exertion, and manifestly does so in a large 
proportion of these patients. 

"9. Excessive cigarette smoking is not the essential 
cause in most cases of "soldier's heart"; but, 
in our opinion, it is an important contributory 
factor in the breathlessness and precordial 
pain of many of them." 

While these circulatory changes can be demonstrated, 
it is important to remember that they may not be as 
serious in their effect as would seem to be implied. Cer- 
tainly smoking to excess is injurious to health. For 
some, one cigar may be "excess"; for others the margin 
is greater. For any person "four or five cigarettes during 
a period of forty minutes" is marked excess. 

A Need for Accuracy. The leaf of the tobacco plant 
is used for smoking and chewing, and in powdered form 
as snuff. There are many reasons why tobacco should 
not be used by man, and probably few reasons for its 
use. With this viewpoint there are some people who 
say that a person who uses tobacco is a fool, and that 
he will go insane if he smokes cigarettes. Now such 
a statement is at variance with the facts. In condemn- 
ing or praising any method or practice care should be 
exercised in forming a judgment and discretion used in 
stating a belief. What does tobacco do to the cells of the 
body? 1 How does it injure them? What may be the 
loss in terms of efficiency? These are the questions that 
we should be prepared to answer.

General Effects of Tobacco. 1 "In the first place we 
know men who are strong physically, keen mentally, 
and sound morally, who at times use tobacco. If they 
use it moderately, they may reply to our question by 
saying "smoking does not hurt me." By such a state- 
ment one means that there is no perceptible harm. Some 
experiments 2 indicate that moderate and habitual use 
of tobacco is not harmful to adults and distinctly helpful 
to certain ones. 

"It is true that the use of tobacco forms a habit that 
tends to increase the amount of tobacco used. This 
is the special danger in cigarette smoking. It leads 
frequently to the use of so many cigarettes that health 
and strength are lost. 

"That smoking causes undesirable effect upon the 
body is shown in the custom of college athletes. Coaches 
and trainers do not permit smoking by those who play 
on the team, and all athletes who seek to excel in sport 
do not use tobacco. 

"We know that smoking impairs one's physical effi- 
ciency. A war correspondent, visiting the Italian trenches 
in the Trentino during the recent war, writes as follows: 

" 'As we pushed on, all our old sins of pipes and 
cigarettes began to be expiated in our middle-aged hearts. 
. . . So we struggled on, the easy perspiration bath- 
ing our bodies. Hiatt was doing better than I, being 
younger and less guilty of cigarettes. I could force 
myself until I could go no further; would stop; would 
droop over my alpenstock and pant like a netted 



"Men who smoke to excess find that they become 
nervous, lose their appetite for wholesome food, and 
show a distinct loss in efficiency." On the other hand, 
many men who smoke moderately testify to the values

they experience in satisfying a habit that for them has 
no known deleterious effects. 

The Effects of Tobacco Upon Youth. "The youth 
who looks forward to physical efficiency as well as men- 
tal efficiency as important factors in doing a work and 
achieving a place in the world, should leave tobacco alone. 
The growing boy is injured by the use of tobacco. His 
growth is interfered with, his heart is made irritable, 
and his stomach disturbed. If the boy thinks he wants 
to smoke, he should wait until he is twenty-five years 
old; then with developed body and a wiser mind, if the 
use of tobacco seems desirable, let him make the choice, 
cognizant of its dangers and limitations. The youth 
who looks forward to excellence in athletics, to achieve- 
ment in business or the professions, to authority and 
control in store and factory, will select his habits as care- 
fully as his friends, his food as carefully as his facts, 
and he will leave tobacco out of the things that are for 
him." 

Tobacco and the Sexes. The increase in the use of 
tobacco by women has caused great concern to many 
people who are interested in racial health. The state- 
ment has been made that smoking is more serious hi its 
effects on women because of their possessing a more 
delicately adjusted nervous system. No proof of a scien- 
tific kind has been presented to show this. 

More significant in effect is the secret and hidden 
character of the act, resulting in destructive tendencies 
in personality, showing especially in loss of confidence, 
lack of self-expression, and even fears. No woman or 
man may with impunity carry on any secret practice 
without distinct personal loss that is reflected in the 
general health and well being of the body.

Plan of Discussion. The waste of the body is carried 
off via the lungs, the skin (to a limited extent), the in- 
testines, and the kidneys. We have discussed the part 
of the lungs in the removal of carbon dioxid; in this 
chapter the part played by the other organs in this system 
and their proper care will be presented. 

Nature and Function of the Skin. The skin is a 
flexible and elastic covering of the body that serves 

279 



280 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

largely for protection, but slightly as an organ of elimi- 
nation. For this latter function it is dependent upon 
innumerable sweat glands located in the skin that give 
off in a day from 1 to 2 pints of liquid. This excretion 
when profuse is composed 1 of small quantities of sodium 
chlorid, sulphates, phosphates of the alkaline salts, urea, 
uric acid, creatinin, aromatic oxyacids, ethereal sulphates 
of phenol and skatol, and at times albumin. The action 
of 'these glands is increased during exercise, or by any 
condition that brings more blood to the skin, as an in- 
crease of temperature of the surrounding air either by 
direct heat or by clothing that is a poor heat conductor. 

The Skin as an Index of Health. It is a fact that the 
skin is an important index of health. This is so because 
we see in an individual more of skin than of any other 
tissue, and the skin responds to circulation, waste prod- 
ucts, poisons, bacteria, very much as other parts of the 
body do. If the skin is healthy in appearance it repre- 
sents internal health, although it is not an infallible 
guide. The muscles of the face, especially, indicate 
general muscular tone, and if the skin is sagging and 
flabby there, it represents usually a weak muscular tone 
all over the body. 

Because the skin stands in the popular mind for bodily 
health, and because most people have the laudable desire 
to appear well and strong and vital, it is a practice with 
certain individuals to decorate the skin of the face. 
Some criticize this as a remnant of barbarism and cite 
instances of savages who practice face painting, but it 
is reasonable to suppose that in modern life it relates 
to a desire to appear attractive, to seem healthy and 
vigorous. It is important to emphasize in this connec- 
tion that such health is only skin deep, that it fools no 
one, and that the counterfeit is evidence of the absence of 
the real thing. Furthermore, health comes from within

of Physiology, W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, 1919, p. 830, 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 281 

and cannot be put on. It cannot be bought in a box. 
The skin itself is kept healthy by proper functioning of 
the body with regular removal of waste, by cleanliness, 
by avoidance of certain poisons and foods, and of condi- 
tions that disturb the internal secretions of the body. 
This last point will be discussed in connection with the 
hygiene of the reproductive system. 

The skin serves as an index of health because we are 
accustomed to judge health by "looks." It is true, of 
course, that the outward appearance is suggestive of the 
internal health. Persons are continually judging the 
health status of other persons by the way they walk or 
sit, by the appearance of the skin or facial expression. 
How often one conveys impressions of poor physical 
condition by the way one walks is not generally appre- 
ciated. The posture oft proclaims the man, and it is 
important to remember that good posture, clear skin, 
and happy expression are real evidences of health. 

It is unnecessary to rely upon general signs in deter- 
mining health. The science of medicine has advanced 
beyond the tongue and conjunctiva stage. The laboratory 
sciences are used to determine the way the body is per- 
forming its functions. The list of examinations given on 
pages 108, 109, indicates the available scientific procedures 
that may be used to determine the cause of ill health. 
Many of these procedures naturally relate to the elimina- 
tive system because many of man's errors in living show 
so quickly in disturbed elimination. To care properly 
for this system is a matter of importance. 

Care of the Skin. So far as organic health is con- 
cerned, it is probably true that bathing is not essential 
to health. There are numerous examples of people who 
live long and are peculiarly free from disease without 
bathing, except perhaps at very infrequent intervals. 
But the modern conception of health always involves 
something more than mere freedom from disease, and 
in this matter as in others the significance of the indirect 
and reflex influences of procedures upon mental attitude, 



282 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

outlook, and sense of bodily well-being must not be 
missed. One of the values often associated with exercise 
is the shower that follows the activity. This is service- 
able not alone because of the removal of dirt, but also 
because of the reflex, stimulating effects upon the nervous 
system. 

The external layer of the skin is made up of many 
scale-like cells packed very close together. These outer- 
most cells are dead and are continually shed from the 
surface of the body. Held together by the sebaceous 
matter from the oil glands of the skin, they form with 
the dirt that collects upon the body a pellicle that covers 
the openings of the perspiratory glands. The oil glands 
and perspiratory glands are continually pouring their 
secretions upon the surface of the body. To remove 
this waste accumulation it is very desirable that bathing 
be made a regular and frequent habit. 

The Warm Bath. The warm bath (from 90 to 98 F.) 
is essentially a cleansing bath. The heat causes dilation 
of the skin vessels with resulting redness of the skin 
and increase in perspiration. The warm bath produces 
relaxation of the muscles and is particularly beneficial 
after fatiguing labor. It soothes the individual and is 
conducive to sleep and rest. For some, however, the 
warm bath is stimulating and should not be taken before 
retiring. This effect of stimulation is liable to occur 
if a hot bath is taken (over 98 F.). 

The Hot Bath The hot bath (over 98 F.) should be 
taken only if prescribed by a physician. 

The Cold Bath (under 65 F.). Bathing in cold water 
is becoming more and more popular, due largely to the 
pronounced beneficial effects. It should be performed 
in the morning on arising because of its stimulating 
action. The cold water acting upon the nerve endings 
in the skin arouses them to increased activity, causing 
constriction of the vessels (to be followed subsequently 
by dilatation) and a wholesome stimulation of the nerves. 
The ideal method of taking the cold bath is by means 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 283 

of the shower; bombardment of the skin by the dashing 
particles of water is markedly beneficial in addition to 
the effect of the cold. Moreover, the shower is a much 
more sanitary affair than the tub. 

The tub, though, is available to more people than the 
shower, and it may be used effectively to secure all that 
is essential. The procedure for the cold tub should be 
as follows: Fill the tub from 12 to 14 inches with water 
as cold as can be borne. For men the tub may be filled 
during the shaving process. Before entering the tub 
wash the face and neck with cold water. If desired, 
certain parts of the body may be cleansed with soap 
and warm water. One is then ready to enter the cold 
tub. It is important to proceed according to directions. 
Step into the tub and sit down, allowing the water to 
come over the legs and thighs. At once lie back so that 
the water rolls over the chest and shoulders. Immedi- 
ately get out of the tub and rub down with a coarse 
towel. 

The normal result of the cold bath is to drive the 
blood from the skin vessels to the internal organs. On 
emerging from the bath the vessels of the skin dilate, 
the skin becomes flushed, and a pleasing sensation of 
warmth follows. This is called the reaction. If reac- 
tion does not occur, this is an indication that the bath 
is not suited to the individual. 

For those who can bathe in cold water there are dis- 
tinct health benefits. Most people, except the aged, 
can indulge in this form of bathing the year around if 
the practice is started in the summer, and if a warm 
bathroom is available. Some people say that they can- 
not take a cold bath because of the shock to the nervous 
system. On the contrary, it may be noted that the 
majority of people with profit to health can and should 
practice the cold bath daily. In addition to serving as 
an effective protection against colds it remains a pro- 
cedure with marked wholesome effects upon the general 
health, promoting appetite, digestion of food, and im- 



284 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

proved mental activity. The cold bath should be taken 
before breakfast; the warm bath before retiring. A 
complete body bath should never be taken until at least 
two hours after a meal, and preferably three. The best 
tune, of course, is before eating. 

Lusk states, "Cool baths and winds increase the metabo- 
lism which must be effected through the chemical regula- 
tion." The effect of baths and douches lasting three 
and a half to five minutes is given by Lusk, 1 who refers 
to the work of Rubner. "When the water has a tempera- 
ture of about 16 C. (about 61 F.) he (Rubner) finds that 
the carbon dioxid elimination may be very largely in- 
creased, especially in the case of the douche. The effect 
of the douche was more marked if taken before breakfast 
when the intestinal tract was free from food. The 
results before breakfast were as follows":

This increased metabolism lasts about one and a hah* 
hours. The cold bath, by diminishing body heat and 
by increasing metabolic processes, is a desirable pro- 
cedure for a person who is overweight. 

Substitutes for the Cold Shower or Tub. If the tub 
or shower is not available, or if the physical condition 
does not warrant the full bath, the cold sponge bath 
should be employed. There are few persons in America 
who cannot take advantage of this procedure. A sponge 
as large as a quart can should be used. Saturate the 
sponge with cold water and squeeze over the arms, chest,

delphia, 1919, p. 144. 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 285 

back, and legs. Follow with a vigorous rub of the entire 
body with a coarse towel. 

For those who have not the facilities for the above, 
washing the face, neck, and chest with cold water will 
be found very helpful in protecting the body against cold. 

The Habit of Bathing. The great thing in all educa- 
tion for health is to establish habits. Much of the routine 
care of the body involves at first considerable effort 
of will and careful planning of the day's program. The 
chief point of importance in forming a habit, as James 
has so well pointed out, is to permit no exception to occur. 
This instruction is particularly important in cold bath- 
ing. Permit no exception. Begin in the summertime; 
day in and day out follow the program. 1 In several 
months the habit will be fairly started, and after a year's 
experience the body will have become so accustomed 
to the refreshing and stimulating reaction that the habit 
could hardly be given up at all. 

Other Forms of Bathing. Sea bathing is held by many 
to be especially beneficial to health. The virtue ascribed, 
usually, is in the salt of the water. In this connection 
it should be noted that salt is not absorbed through the 
skin, and that if salt were the efficacious agent then 
sea baths could be taken at home by purchasing sea 
salt. Salt baths may be taken in this way, but the values 
of transporting the ocean to the apartment are psy- 
chologic, if any at all. 

The real values in sea bathing are to be assigned to 
other factors. The outdoor air, the usual sunshine, the 
happy companions, the play and sport on the beach 
these are the great tonics, the real cause for the exhilara- 
tion and bodily well-being that come from a swim in 
the ocean. A business firm specializing in sea salt would 
try to convince otherwise; this is because they have 
salt to sell and are not able to sell pleasurable recreation, 
pure outdoor air, and sunshine. 

1 It will be necessary for women to interrupt this schedule during 
the menstrual period. 



286 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

It is important not to stay in the cold water of the 
ocean too long. If the body feels chilly it is time to come 
out and get a good rub down. Probably for most people 
twenty minutes is the limit in time to be allowed. Cer- 
tainly, blueness of the lips or finger-tips indicates that 
the heart and lungs are meeting with difficulty the body 
needs; the intelligent person will not disobey such signs. 

The Turkish bath is a form of bathing available usually 
in large cities only. The Romans in the later days of 
the Empire engaged in many of the procedures used 
in the modern Turkish bath. This form of bathing is 
well borne by most people, and although to be classed 
as a luxury and in no sense a real necessity for living 
healthfully, it is valuable after severe physical exertion, 
and for certain types of muscular and joint conditions 
following rheumatism. 

The Russian bath is similar to the Turkish, but differs 
in providing hot vapor instead of hot air. This type of 
bath is recommended often for certain dry forms of 
bronchitis and chronic laryngitis. 

The sun bath indicates, by its name, that the body may 
be bathed without water. We may consider logically, 
therefore, exposure of the body to the sun and air as in 
effect a bath. For some years sunlight has been used, 
especially in Switzerland, for the treatment of bone and 
joint tuberculosis. The extension of physiotherapy, 
especially since the World War, has emphasized anew 
the value of the sun's rays in stimulating metabolic 
processes, and particularly the formation of hemoglobin. 
Thus, the sun bath is to be considered as a valuable 
hygienic measure, improving nutrition and general 
health. Exposure to the sun's rays should be, for brief 
periods, very gradually extended. If the exposure is 
overdone, sunstroke may occur. Not infrequently, 
people on vacations suffer with headache and general 
debility from too much exposure to the sun. 

The Complexion. The care of the skin of the face 
presents to many persons serious problems. The com- 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 287 

plexion is important as a matter of justifiable personal 
pride. Some of the fundamental facts in relation to the 
complexion are given below: 

1. The complexion is an indication of internal bodily 

states. Pallor, flabbiness, blotches, pimples, dis- 
colorations, enlarged blood-vessels, floridness are 
signs of habits of living and of the general health. 

2. These unfavorable and undesirable signs are to be 

removed (when possible) by correcting the errors 
in living, by removing the cause. 

3. The quality of the skin in different individuals 

varies so greatly that a preparation effective for 
one person may be injurious to another. The 
dry skin and the oily skin require care of a differ- 
ent kind. 

4. Local conditions may injure the skin of the face 

and result in constant disturbance until the condi- 
tions are removed. 

Unless one works at a dirty or greasy occupation the 
face should never be washed with hot water and soap. 
For most persons, it may be said, that washing the face 
three times daily in cold water is sufficient for cleansing 
purposes. The cold water tones up the elastic tissue in 
the skin, improves the circulation, and is a deterrent to 
the appearance of wrinkles. With the exception noted 
above soap should not be used. The hope that many 
people have in medicated soap is directly proportional 
to their belief in the mystical and the magical, and 
to their reading of promising advertisements. No justi- 
fication exists for any reliance on medicated soaps. As 
a rule, their virtue lies chiefly in their odor or appearance. 
One soap claims to be a health soap because of the presence 
of carbolic acid; another seeks preference because it is 
impregnated with the salve that is to be used with it; 
all rest their case upon unwarranted and unscientific 
claims. 

The following advertisement of a "skin beautifier" 
illustrates the tendency to be combated: ". . . makes

as if by magic." 

This "beautifier" on analysis gives: Zinc oxid, 7 per

will buy seats at the ' Tollies" for the manufacturer;

with more authority than the scientific physician. They 
long for buncombe. This tendency is capitalized by the 
patent medicine interests who for simple compounds 
of soda and borax use elaborate, meaningless, but mys- 
terious names. 

Frequently cosmetics are advertised under fake columns 
(Fig. 28) in second rate newspapers, as " Answers to 
Correspondents," "Health and Beauty Ad vice, " or 
"Health and Beauty Helps." In one such column the 
following appeared: 

"Lucile. A good 'liquid powder' or face wash is made by dis- 
solving 4 ounces of spurmax in \ pint of hot water and adding 2 
teaspoonfuls of glycerin. This home-made complexion beautifier 
whitens the skin without the use of powder and is particularly 
recommended for anyone who has a sallow, dark, or oily skin." 

On careful chemical analysis, spurmax is found to consist of 

Crystallized magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts) . 100 per cent. 

Perfume trace. 

Coloring-matter trace. 

The retail price of spurmax is one-half dollar. The estimated 
cost of the ingredients is less than one cent. 



The necessity for all persons understanding the nature 
of the skin, its needs and functions, stands out as an 
imperative demand in these days of such blatant and 
unshamed lying in advertisements. 

If a soap is used for cleansing the face, the only de- 
sideratum is that it be pure and non-irritating. For 
persons with an oily skin or persons living in cities where 
the air is filled with soot, the daily use of soap may be 
necessary; but pallor is to be corrected by improving 
the quality of the blood, flabbiness of the skin by exercise 
and cold baths, blotches and pimples by medical advice 
and guidance when hygiene alone has not sufficed. 

If the skin is unusually dry, a little oil may be applied. 
In hot weather a little powder may be welcomed. Cer- 
tainly, if used sparingly, there can be no harm; its use 
is a matter of taste. 

19 



290 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

The use of hot water on the face and subsequent expo- 
sure to cold air or wind usually results in chapping. In 
"make-up" for dramatics it is important to apply a 
plain cream to the face before the paints or charcoal 
are used. This permits their easy removal and prevents 
clogging of the pores with irritating substances. 

Care of the Hair. The hair grows from follicles in 
the skin. At the follicle the hair cells are alive, the 
growth occurs in the follicle, and the hair is pushed out. 
The ends of the hair are dead and resemble the outer 
layer of the skin in this respect. This physiologic fact 
should be borne in mind when singeing is proposed as a 
method "to prevent the hair from bleeding." The scalp 
has numerous oil or sebaceous glands which pour out 
their secretion near the roots of each hair follicle. This 
secretion keeps the hair oily and prevents breaking. 
Individuals vary in the amount of oil produced by the 
scalp; some scalps are dry, others are very oily. 

The hair should be cared for as a part of the general 
plan to keep one's self clean, well-groomed, and in good 
condition. The loss of hair or dirtiness of the scalp 
may have nothing to do with digestion of food, but it is 
to be noted that health is a complex matter associated 
with indirect as well as direct factors. Reasonable care 
and attention to the body results often in reflex mental 
states of optimism and cheer, in wholesome ways of 
looking at problems, in consciousness of power, that 
are immensely valuable to society as well as to the in- 
dividual. Shampooing the hair should be performed 
whenever the hair and scalp are dirty. For some with 
oily scalps this may mean once a week; for others with 
dry scalps, two or three week intervals will be desirable. 
For the shampoo, any good toilet soap may be used. 
There is no special value in the advertised products. 
A good shampoo liquid soap is the official linamentum 
saponis mollis. This may be purchased at any drug 
store. It contains 50 parts of soft soap, 2 parts of oil 
of lavender, and 33 parts of alcohol. 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 291 

After thoroughly washing the hair and vigorously 
massaging the scalp with the firger-tips, the soap should 
be entirely removed by frequent douching. In winter 
one should always end with cold water. The hair should 
then be thoroughly dried, and particular attention should 
be paid to drying the hair at the back of the neck and 
around the ears before going out-of-doors. 

If the scalp is found to be particularly dry after sham- 
pooing, it will be advisable to add a small amount of 
oil or grease. For this purpose, pure liquid vaselin will 
be found very good. Some advise olive oil. The addi- 
tion of the oil prevents cracking and breaking of the 
hair and scaling of the outermost cells of the scalp. 

Daily massage of the scalp will improve the circula- 
tion and favor the growth and luster of the hair. The 
procedure of the hostler in caring for his horse may be 
an example applied here. The hair will be maintained 
in good condition by keeping it clean and by frequent 
brushing. 

Care of the Nails. The nails are similar to the hair 
in that they are growths from the skin. A Chinese 
custom, gradually disappearing, is still found, especially 
among Chinese students, who wear the nails long and 
pointed, indicating that they have no need to do physical 
work. The condition of the nails is a sign of the care 
given to the body by the individual American just as 
truly as the long nail is a sign of the vocation of the 
Chinese. Clean, well-kept nails may be considered with 
other items of personal hygiene as representative of 
the interest of the individual in maintaining an optimum 
physical state. That some persons give more attention 
to the care of the nails than they do to the care of the 
nervous system is merely a sign of the quality of the 
latter and the mixing of values; it does not mean that 
the nails should be neglected. 

The cuticle surrounding the nail should be pressed 
back once or twice a week with an orange stick. If 
excessively dry, the cuticle may be softened by applying 






PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

pure liquid vaselin at night before retiring. Unless the 
cuticle is cared for in this way "hang nails" are liable 
to form and may give rise to serious infections. The 
surface of the nail should never be scraped. 

The nails of the fingers should be cut in a curve with 
a pair of curved scissors. Filing of the cut surface to 
give smoothness is desirable. The toe nails should be 
cut straight across, to prevent ingrowing of the nails. 

Care of the Hands. The hands are always contami- 
nated with bacteria. Numerous experiments have 
shown that it is very difficult to sterilize the hands and 
nails, even after scrubbing with soap, hot water, lime 
and soda, and soaking in bichlorid. The fingers contain 
in the folds of the cuticle and under the nails always 
a varying amount of de*bris that is bacteriologic. A 
typical sample shows various cocci, particularly strepto- 
cocci and staphylococci, colon bacilli and spirillae, yeast 
cells and other fungi derived from the mouth, soil, food, 
body surface, water, nose, eyes, sewage, dust, dirt, etc. 

It would seem that these were significant facts if they 
helped one to prevent infection by the hands. To pre- 
vent such infection there are at least two important 
notations: 

1. Clean hands for all first-aid services. In bandaging 

wounds, or attending to any injury of the skin, 
first clean the hands as thoroughly as possible 
with soap and hot water. 

2. Prevent auto-infections. Because of the varying 

uses to which the hands are put, and the nature 
and conditions of the objects handled, the hands 
are always dirty, i. e., they harbor bacteria. So 
long as the skin of the hands is not broken, these 
bacteria cause no disturbance if they are not 
transferred to the mouth, nose, or to an opening 
in the skin of the body produced by scratches or 
cuts in its epidermal covering. It is important, 
therefore, to indicate the ways in which the hands 
carry bacteria. 



HYGIENE OP THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 293 

(a) Scratching the body with the nails. 

By scratching the body with the nails the skin 
may be broken and a direct infection result 
from the infected nail. In this way lupus, 
acne, boils, and carbuncles have been trans- 
mitted. In this way also a disturbance in one 
part of the body may be spread widely over 
the body, e. g., poison ivy. 
(6) Biting the nails. 

Biting the nails is unhygienic because of the 
effect on the nails, of the undesirable nervous 
habit, and of transmission to the mouth of 
bacteria from the fingers, 
(c) Putting fingers in the mouth. 

It has been stated by Chapin that if the sali- 
vary glands secreted indigo, this world would 
be a blue place indeed. His reference strikes 
at a very common and reprehensible practice. 
It is seen among persons who moisten their 
fingers with saliva to turn the pages of book 
or magazine. Conductors engage in this uni- 
versal trade as they give out transfers. It 
should be stated, therefore, that nothing should 
be put into the mouth except clean food and 
clean drink. 

Some people develop phobias relating to this fact of 
contamination of the hands. Such persons refuse to 
handle money without gloves and build up a number of 
similar prohibitions that are senseless and foolish. 

Pointed Paragraphs. The great variety of practice 
in the hygiene of the skin, hair, and nails, and the many 
questions asked by students suggest that pointed direc- 
tions be given to set forth in concise fashion the best 
judgments on many questions: 

1. Hair tonics have no special value. Health of the 
hair depends upon the general health and the 
blood-supply in the scalp. It may be desirable to 
have a special prescription. This should be given 
by a physician and based upon the local condition. 



294 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

2. Daily massage of the scalp and frequent shampooing 

to keep the hair clean are the best tonics to be 
applied locally. 

3. There is no danger from frequent shampooing of the 

hair. The mechanical stimulation is very bene- 
ficial. If excessively dry, a little oil may be added. 

4. The cold bath in the winter may produce an itching 

of the skin of the legs. This bath pruritus is seen 
in persons with an excessively dry skin. The 
condition may be controlled by oiling the parts 
affected after the morning bath. 

5. It is advisable for men to shave themselves. Trouble- 

some and obstinate skin diseases are not infre- 
quently contracted in public barber shops. The 
damp towel, or shaving brush, is usually the 
medium of infection. 

6. Shaving of the head to promote growth of the hair 

is a useless procedure. 

7. Curling the hair on pins or papers is not injurious, 

but procedures used to produce a "permanent 
wave" 1 make the hair unusually dry and brittle, 
and destroy the "life" and luster of the hair. 

8. Hair removers should be used only upon the advice 

of a physician. One sure method of removing 
superfluous hair is by electrolysis. This requires 
a specialist skilled in the technic. Painful and 
serious abscesses are caused at times by crude 
methods of removing the hair from the armpit. 

9. It has been said that the only sensible thing to do 

for gray hair is to admire it. Some persons are 
unable to face the problem as squarely as that. 
If dyes are used, great care should be taken that 
they do not contain lead, for serious results fre- 
quently follow in the form of lead-poisoning. The 
following item (Fig. 29) in the New York Tribune 

1 It is interesting to note that negroes use preparations to take 
out the kink in the hair and the white race (women) employ nu- 
merous measures to achieve a curl or wave.

of August 8, 1920, indicates the danger of such 
treatment: 

Singer Treated for Gray 
Hair Sue for $25^000 

Mrs. Gertrude Bianco and Her 

Husband Seek Damage From 

Specialist 

Mrs. Gertrude Bianco, of 316 West 
122d Street, a concert singer, alleging 
that she was blind for several days, 
the glands in her neck swollen and 
lumps developed on her head, follow- 
ing treatment to restore gray hair to 
its natural shade, filed a suit for 
$25,000 damages in the Supreme Court 
yesterday against John Andre, of 57 
West Thirty-ninth Street. Attilio 
Bianco, husband of the plaintiff, also 
filed a suit for $5,000 damages against 
Andre for loss of his wife's services. 
Mrs. Bianco says she called on Andre 
on December 26 in company with a 
friend who had recommended the de- 
fendant as an expert in the treatment 
of the hair. Andre, it is alleged, as- 
sured Mrs. Bianco he could make Her 
gray- locks black again, and in such a 
manner that neither, salt water, steam 
nor hair lotions would tarnish them. 

The plaintiff submitted to the treat- 
ment. In a few days, she claims, all 
the things happened ta her o which 
she complains, she was. in great pain, 
besides being incapacitated for some 
time, &&d suffered financial loss. 

Fig. 29. The use of dye preparations for the hair is frequently 
dangerous. 

10. Perspiration checks depend for their action upon 
salicylic acid. The nostrum PERSPIRO is said 
to be the prescription marketed by a patient 
for whom it was prescribed. The well-known 
Thiersche's powder is the foundation of most 
perspiration remedies. It contains salicylic acid 
1 gram and boric acid 10 grams. 



296 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

11. Most deodorants depend upon aluminum for their 

effect. Odor-o-no, Mum, and others widely ad- 
vertised are very simple preparations, perfumed, 
and given names that advertise easily. 

12. There are numerous depilatories on the market. 

Whether as Delatone, Delol, El Rado or Nodene, 
they are dependent for their action upon barium, 
calcium, or sodium sulphid. Analyses are given 
in Nostrums and Quackery, Volume II. 

13. If the hands are always washed carefully before 

eating and if fingers are carefully kept out of the 
mouth and nose, and if the body is not scratched 
with the nails, the bacteria and other dirt that 
accumulate on the hands may be considered as 
harmless. 

The Clothing of the Body. The role of clothing in 
modern civilization appears in an uncertain light when 
one observes furs in summer and the thinnest of silk 
stockings in winter, or when the young child with bare 
legs is exposed to the cold harsh winds of winter or early 
spring. Are these feminine foibles of no moment? Is 
clothing to be judged by style merely? Are wholesome- 
ness and beauty forever at odds in human dress? There 
lies in this very problem of clothing the real heart of the 
problem of health. The hygienic knowledge is avail- 
able, but it must compete against selfish and foolish 
attitudes, unworthy life goals and guides. Here as else- 
where the problem of living finely and well consists in 
the utilization of scientific fact, of demonstrated truth. 
The willingness to sacrifice health for high heels, to waste 
in crude and vulgar ways the affective values of life for 
momentary popularity, to let the race take care of itself, 
are attitudes that must give way before the dominant 
sense of the social and moral responsibility for living at 
one's best. The hygiene of clothing also demands, there- 
fore, at the very outset the application of scientific fact. 

Seasonal Clothing. Clothing should be used as a 
protective covering for the body and should fulfil the 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 



297 



demands of the body as regards heat conservation or 
dissipation. For civilized man only about 20 per cent, 
of his surface is normally exposed to the air. For pro- 
tecting the body against cold, clothing that holds air 
in its meshes is most satisfactory. Rubner has shown 
how valuable fur is because of this quality. He cites 
the fact that the hair of the black cat, black lamb, 
rabbit, skunk, raccoon, mink, musk-deer, and sheep 
weighs very little itself, but the fur contains so much 
air that it may be said to consist by weight of 97.3 to 
98.8 per cent, of air, and only from 1.2 to 2.7 per cent, 
of hair. 

Hot weather clothing that will permit circulation of 
air and yet that will absorb moisture is very important. 
Garments that do not take up moisture but allow per- 
spiration to collect on the surface of the body are highly 
unsatisfactory, because in times of high temperature 
evaporation is retarded, and hence cooling of the body 
is interfered with; and at low temperatures a great 
amount of heat is lost by conduction through the moisture, 
and hence there is rapid chilling of the body. 

Clothing has marked influence on metabolic changes 
occurring in the body as given by Lusk, 1 who uses Rubner's 
figures:

298 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

This is the sort of scientific evidence from which the 
hygienist determines his rules. It will be observed that 
the individual with "summer clothes" had to burn more 
food material, as indicated by the greater C0 2 output, 
than the individual who wore "summer clothes and 
winter overcoat" or the one dressed with "summer clothes 
and fur coat." This means, of course, that children 
and women, who are chiefly concerned in this matter, 
are losing valuable body heat by lack of proper protec- 
tion of the body. It thus becomes a matter^of prime 
importance in health that the body heat be conserved, 
that the losses of heat be prevented. This is of particular 
importance on cold, windy days because of the greater 
loss at such times. 

Men who spend the days indoors in heated apart- 
ments and offices will find it convenient and practical 
and healthful to use light-weight suits, and in cold weather 
to secure the additional protection by a suitable over- 
coat. Women are less easily provided for because of the 
widely varying types and quality of clothing used. The 
principle to be applied by each person, however, is that 
of adequate protection from cold in winter and freedom 
from moisture on the body in summer. City persons 
living indoor lives will find it desirable to have for out- 
of-door or sport wear durable clothing that will not 
only be suitable for physical activity but also serve 
adequately the temperature and climatic changes. 

The farmer, the truckman, the outdoor worker gener- 
ally will find it essential in cold weather to wear woolen 
next to the skin. This is admirable for two reasons: it 
is very absorbent, and hence it takes up the perspiration, 
and it prevents rapid evaporation, and hence it is warm. 

Old persons and children will find it very satisfactory 
to use woolens in winter. For summer wear light cotton 
fabrics are very satisfactory. Silk is usually expensive, 
but is always soft and cool. 

The color of clothing is of high importance. White 
and all light colors absorb fewest of the heat rays and 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 299 

thus are more suitable as colors for summer wear. White 
is preferable to colors produced by cheap anilin dyes. 
Such dyes at tunes cause marked irritation of the skin. 

Underclothing. Underclothing is essential to protect 
the outer garments from the perspiration of the body, 
and to provide a covering that may be readily washed, 
kept clean, and changed to meet the temperature and 
seasonal changes. Underclothing should be changed 
frequently. This necessity varies with the amount 
of perspiration of the individual. When taken off at 
night the underclothing should be placed over a chair 
in such fashion that it will be thoroughly aired. 
Damp underclothing should be changed at once, and 
especially if the day is windy or cold. Soiled underwear 
favors the development of micro-organisms which produce 
at times annoying skin diseases. 

Fortunately, women of the present day need little 
instruction in the matter of tight lacing of corsets. The 
old days of the wasp waist are gone let us hope for- 
ever. It is held by some that women would be healthier 
if they did not wear corsets, but this is conditioned upon 
other matters, such as support for clothing, proper exer- 
cise involving the trunk muscles, and child bearing. 
The more flexible corset or waist so popular today is 
generally desirable. 

How to Wear Clothing. The average woman who will 
wear dresses and undergarments supported from the 
shoulders or hips, who will be physically active, and who 
will allow at least two years to elapse between preg- 
nancies, will be healthier and happier without a corset. 
For those who wear skirts supported at the waist a 
light corset will be found very helpful. 

The hygienic principle to keep in mind in corseting 
the trunk relates to the height, rigidity, and fit of the 
garment. The corset should be low and flexible. It 
should fit snugly over the hip bones and give support 
to the lower third of the abdominal wall, exerting a force 
upward and backward. In no case should the corset 



300 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

be permitted to compress the waist or lower chest. It 
is important in this connection to emphasize the value 
to the wearer of the corset of standing away from the 
corset and not permitting herself to hang on the corset 
as a support. 

Unfortunately, men of the present day are victims 
of a custom in clothing that is injurious in a similar 
way as is the corset for women. Discarding suspenders 
for supporting the trousers, men today in large numbers 
wear belts. Because the trousers are often cut high to 
complete the dressing joint with the vest, the belt is 
tightened around the waist. This causes an undesirable 
constriction. It is important, therefore, if a belt is worn 
to support the trousers that the bearing of the belt come 
on the hip bones of the pelvis and not above. An observa- 
tion of the position of the belt in laborers doing heavy 
work, such as trenching, will indicate the superior value 
of the low position. 

All tight and constricting clothing should be excluded 
if one seeks to secure maximum health and efficiency. 
Garters worn around the legs will, if too tight or if worn 
above the knee especially, constrict the blood-vessels 
and impede the venous return. The growing practice 
among women of having garters attached to the corset 
or underclothing is admirable in this connection, but 
it should be remembered that the point of attachment 
should be at the side of the hips rather than in front. 
The front pull exerts a traction upon the pelvis tending 
to produce an increased lumbar curve, or hollow back, 
with all the attendant ills and discomforts. For men, 
the usual garter to support the socks is not bad if not 
worn too tight. The sense of freedom and exhilaration 
that comes at times when, in sport or camp costume, 
one omits the usual garter, is an indication of the value 
that would come by the provision of a support for men's 
socks that would be practical and yet not constricting. 

Collars should never be worn tight enough to constrict 
the surface blood-vessels of the neck. Headaches not 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 301 

infrequently result from tight collars. It is. advisable 
for men to wear a collar J inch larger than the size of the 
shirt band. 

Socks and stockings should be large enough to permit 
free movement of the toes. It is important to change 
them frequently, especially in summer. When tired, 
it is very helpful to change the shoes and stockings. 
Bathing the feet after fatiguing work is very refreshing. 
If there is excessive perspiration of the feet with an 
offensive odor, it will be found helpful daily to bathe 
the feet in cool water, dry, and dust on the feet a powder 
of salicylic acid 1 part and starch 4 parts. One may 
use to advantage a powder of equal parts of alum and 
talc. This powder should be dusted also into the socks 
or stockings, which should be put on fresh every day. 

Elimination of Body Waste by the Kidneys. The 
kidneys are two glandular organs that remove from the 
blood excess water and waste materials. About 3 to 
4 pints of water are removed daily. The waste is in the 
form of urea, uric acid, creatin, creatinin, phosphates 
and sulphates of calcium, sodium and potassium, to- 
gether with other complex chemical compounds. Efficient 
action of the skin makes less strenuous the demands 
upon the kidneys. The waste materials removed by the 
kidneys are chiefly the end-products of protein metabo- 
lism. Diets rich in protein increase the work that the 
kidneys must do. Urea is increased with muscular 
exercise; with a decrease in the normal action of the 
kidneys, the urea in the sweat is increased. 

Keeping the Kidneys Efficient. There should be proper 
care of all the following factors influencing the kidneys: 
1. Rational diet: The body should not be overburdened 
with protein, and particularly nucleoprotein food. 
Inadequate combustion, with greater waste, re- 
sults from overeating (especially of protein), just 
as inadequate combustion with clinkers results 
from putting too much fuel in the furnace. This 
waste in the body must be removed by the kidneys. 



302 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

In addition, it is to be remembered that irritat- 
ing foods and highly seasoned foods are undesir- 
able. 

The need for keeping the protein and particularly 
the nucleoprotein content small has been men- 
tioned. Meats should not be eaten more than once 
a day. The difference chemically between the red 
and white meats is in the greater amount of purin 
bases yielded by the former; the important point, 
however, is to keep the total protein intake below 
100 grams daily. 

2. Sufficient water must be drunk to keep the kidneys 

flushed out, to dilute the waste, and to prevent 
the irritation that results from the concentrated 
urine. At least one glass between each meal, 
one with each meal, one before retiring, and one 
on rising in the morning, should be taken. 

3. Free action of the skin: Exercise, prevention of 

chilling the body in winter, and appropriate light 
clothing in summer are important. 

4. Exercise: The exercise should not be too severe. 

It has been found that vigorous athletics produce 
an albuminuria, but whether it is transient or 
represents a permanent injury to the cells of the 
kidneys is not known. It is important to observe 
moderation in athletics. 

Injury of the Kidneys by Disease. Because the kid- 
neys are eliminative organs it falls to them to act as 
poison and toxin removers during disease. It is, there- 
fore, a prudent act and often a vital matter to pro- 
tect the kidneys during disease, and more intelligently, 
to prevent the disease, if possible, and to avoid the 
risk of renal injury. The kidneys are liable especially 
to injury in scarlet fever, typhoid fever, malaria, and 
in all the infectious diseases. One imperative reason 
for relying on medical skill at these times rather than 
on the unscientific and banal pathies, is to forestall kidney 
disturbance by accurate diagnosis and preventive treat-

ment. Figure 30 shows Blight's disease a prominent 
cause of death, more fatal than cancer. 

Kidney Remedies. "Kidney troubles" are frequently 
treated by means of patent medicines. This happens 
because of the prevailing ignorance regarding the physi- 
ology of the renal system, and the lack of understanding 
of the kind and nature of renal disturbances, combined 
with the tendency to expect pills, decoctions, and mix- 
tures to restore diseased tissues to normal condition. 

In the first place it should be pointed out that kidney 
disease does not, as a rule, cause a pain in the lower 
back. Lumbar pain in women is more frequently due

to displacements of the uterus or disturbance of the 
tubes or ovaries; in both sexes pain in the lower back 
is not infrequently due to weak or flat feet and to im- 
proper shoes. 

Again, it should be remembered that the bladder is 
only a receptacle for the secretion of urine. Painful or 
burning micturition does not represent kidney disturbance, 
but usually represents an inflammation of the bladder 
that may be due to infection or to irritating substances 
eliminated by the kidneys.

disturbances. Health of the kidneys is to be restored 
only by intelligent care in medical examination, diagnosis, 
and treatment, and not by resort to guess work, faith, 
and mysterious drugs. 

Medical Examination. As stated before, intelligent 

care of the human body would provide at regular intervals 

examination of the body. This advocacy of periodic 

medical examination is justified by the early detection 

20 



306 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

of kidney disturbance. Diseased kidneys may serve 
for many years if proper measures are followed in diet, 
exercise, and general living conditions. The great in- 
crease in middle age of deaths from kidney disease repre- 
sents in part the lack of personal hygiene among many 
persons, but also the absence of any well-organized 
periodic examination. 

The sort of work being done by the Life Extension 
Institute, Inc., typifies what is needed everywhere, and 
the kind of service, expert and medical, of which persons 
should avail themselves. 

The periodic medical examination that leads to correc- 
tion of errors in diet, exercise, living and working condi- 
tions, may prolong active and vigorous life much beyond 
what we are accustomed to. Old age is a relative term. 
Some persons die of old age diseases at forty years; 
others live happily at sixty or seventy. Scientific medical 
examinations at regular intervals are the beginnings of 
intelligent care of the body. 

Intestines as Organs of Elimination. In addition 
to the waste eliminated by the skin and kidneys the 
waste of undigested food is removed by the intestines. 
In the former the waste comes largely from the action 
of the body cells; in the latter it comes chiefly from food. 

Food material passing through the alimentary tract 
is digested, and the digested foods are absorbed into the 
blood-stream. The undigested waste material left behind 
passes along the intestinal tract to be removed from the 
body at periodic intervals. The movement of the con- 
tents of the tract is facilitated by a rhythmic contrac- 
tion of the muscular walls of the intestine. This is called 
peristalsis. Peristalsis is favored by exercise and by the 
presence of food in masses that stimulate the rhythmic 
contractions. The importance of food not highly con- 
centrated, but with some waste, such as found in green 
vegetables, is to be recognized in this respect. 

The lack of proper peristalsis and inadequate action 
of the intestines produces a stagnation in the tract and 



HYGIENE OF THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM 307 

a condition of infrequency or irregularity in bowel action, 
called constipation. There are many different causes 
of constipation, some congenital or anatomic, others 
purely hygienic. 

Causes of Constipation. 1. Visceroptosis a dropping 
down of the viscera of the abdomen is due often to bad 
posture. Frequently it is associated with general bodily 
weakness resulting from prolonged or serious sickness, 
but often it results from laziness and ladk of proper 
exercise. 

2. Lack of tone is found in children without enough 
vigor to produce peristaltic movements; it is a char- 
acteristic condition in nervous cases and neurasthenic 
individuals. Constipation is constant among mental 
patients in institutions. 

3. Chronic appendicitis is associated with constipation. 

4. Lack of exercise: Sluggishness of the circulation 
and general nutritive processes, associated with physical 
inactivity, are prominent as causes of constipation. 

5. Improper diet: Man has an alimentary tract devel- 
oped in relation to certain foods in the intestines. The 
foods that have played a part in determining the nature 
of the human intestine have been coarse foods and, 
therefore, a concentrated diet, refined and too easily 
digested, is unsuited for its action. The day will not 
soon come when man, for any appreciable length of time, 
can live fully and completely on refined food, or powdered 
food, or liquid food. 

6. Pressure of unhygienic clothing as a cause, was for- 
merly more important than it is today, but it should be 
stated that constriction of the waist by the belt or corset 
should not be tolerated. 

7. Lack of sufficient water: Too little drinking of 
water is a frequent cause of constipation. 

8. Lack of habit of emptying the bowel: The daily 
habit of emptying the bowel at a regular time should 
be developed and rigidly followed. This is very important 
in the training of children. The most favorable time, 



308 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

both as regards the physiologic states of the bowel and 
the organization of the day's program, is immediately 
after breakfast. It should be mentioned in this con- 
nection that a very common cause for unsatisfactory 
results at this time is improper height of the toilet seat. 
It is usually too high. An ideal seat would place the 
body in the position naturally assumed by man hi primi- 
tive conditions. The seat should J>e low enough to bring 
the knees above the seat level. This may be accom- 
plished by placing the feet on a small box.

The Nature of the Nervous System. The nervous 
system is an organization of stimulus-receiving and 
stimulus-sending elements. In simple one-celled organ- 
isms a stimulus is carried to all parts of the cell without 
the use of a special mechanism. In the human body, 
however, there is a highly developed system of conduct- 
ing nerves and co-ordinating nerve centers. In fact, 
there are two closely allied systems, the cerebrospinal 

309 



310 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

and the autonomic, 1 engaged in relating the individual 
to his environment. The former is concerned with volun- 
tary movements; the latter with the involuntary move- 
ments and actions types of activity associated with 
the involuntary muscles and the secretory glands. There 
is another interesting and important characteristic differ- 
ence in the two systems: the cerebrospinal is concerned 
with the receptive, cognitive, and will aspects of life, 
phases represented by the large sense experiences that 
occur, by the understanding and interpreting of stimuli, 
and by the planning and purposing that precede the 
ultimate desired goal of the voluntary act, always an 
act of will; the autonomic, on the other hand, is concerned 
almost entirely with controlling the processes that main- 
tain automatically the life of the individual. Some of 
these (autonomic) processes are protective, some deal 
with the transformation of energy, others with certain 
emptying mechanisms all, however, are associated with 
the action of involuntary muscle in blood-vessel, heart, 
intestine, or other organ and with secretory cells. 

The cerebrospinal nervous system may be said to 
consist of brain, spinal cord, and nerves that lead to 
and from both brain and cord. The nerves coming 
to and from the brain are associated almost entirely with 
functions located in the head, such as sight, hearing, 
the use of the tongue, the sense of smell, and so forth, 
and are called cranial nerves. The nerves coming to 
and from the cord are associated with the skin and muscles 
of the body, and are called spinal nerves. It is to be 
noted that the phrase to and from is used. This use 
relates to function and not to structure. Thus it is that 
certain nerves carry incoming currents or stimuli and 
are known as afferent nerves; others carry outgoing cur- 
rents or stimuli and are known as efferent nerves. 

The afferent nerves carry to the brain either directly 

Langley has suggested "autonomic" for the old term "sympa- 
thetic," as applying to the part of the nervous system in control of 
the involuntary muscles and secretory glands. 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 311 

or by way of the cord stimulations from the skin, 
muscles, or other distal parts; the brain receives this 
stimulation, reacts in accordance with its character, 
and then sends out an impulse over the efferent nerves. 
No act may be considered completed until the entire 
circuit is made and the stimulus received has been 
responded to. 1 

The stimulations or impulses that pass over the efferent 
and afferent nerves travel over units in the nerve struc- 
ture that consist essentially of a cell body with a number 
of branching processes. The message does not travel 
over a route like a telephone message, but at a number 
of places the route is broken and the message must 
transfer from one unit of the system to another. At 
many of these breaks in the course of afferent or efferent 
mechanisms a choice of routes presents itself. Which 
unit shall be chosen to carry the message? Now all 
that we do in education or in training of self relates to the 
selection of routes, to the formation of pathways in the 
brain and cord. Many connections are made that are 
not serviceable they are discarded. The successful 
ones persist and habit forms to bind finally in firm bonds 
the individual, limiting and defining the range of activity 
for all time. Habits may be changed when they are 
"young"; on the other hand, it is often impossible to 
change habits that have been formed for years. There 
are exceptions, though, and by the force of a great emo- 
tion, or strong impelling ideals, the individual may 
with constant care entirely change the extent and char- 
acter of his habits. 

The autonomic system is associated with the digestive, 
nutritive, excretory, and secretory functions of the body. 2 
Structurally it consists of groups of nerve tissue bound 
together into the chains that lie in front of the vertebral 
column (Fig. 33). By means of nerve branches they con-

nect with other masses of nerve tissue, plexuses situated 
in the neighborhood of different organs. 

These two systems, the cerebrospinal and autonomic, 
are closely associated hi activity. In fact, the health 




of the individual is dependent upon the maintenance 
of a proper balance of activity between the two and a 
certain co-ordination and harmonious action. 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 313 

Factors of Importance in Maintaining the Health of 
the Nervous System. Some parts of the human body 
are older than others in the sense that they have under- 
gone less modification in the process of evolution. Other 
structures may be considered as quite new. Thus the 
nervous system with its elaborate modification of the 
brain of man represents comparatively a recent achieve- 
ment in organic evolution. Nevertheless, the nervous 
system embodies the whole story of human development, 
and, because of this fact, it exhibits in many of its reac- 
tions the primitive responses of the race. 

The autonomic system is associated with the functions 
concerned in the maintenance of life. It is also connected 
with the whole emotional life. Cannon 1 has very clearly 
written of this relation of the emotions and has stated 
with scientific accuracy the fortifying mechanisms that 
are brought into play by the action of this system. Prob- 
ably all cerebrospinal activity involves some excitation 
of the autonomic system. The two systems are so closely 
related that for many purposes of psychology they are 
considered as one. For interpretation of health values 
it is important to indicate some of the essential factors 
that are to be considered by those who are seeking to 
live at the optimum point. 

Harmony of Action Between Cerebrospinal and Auto- 
nomic Systems. The health of the nervous system and, 
indeed, of the body as a whole, depends upon a nice 
adjustment of the work to be done by the two systems. 
Overuse of either one or improper use produces char- 
acteristic results. 

A marked tendency in organic evolution has been the 
elaboration of the. cerebral hemispheres. The effort 
has been directed toward central development. The 
necessities in education and in economic life have made 
the cerebrospinal a superior instrument for securing 
satisfactions in life. The autonomic nervous system,

Rage, D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1915. 



314 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

of supreme importance to the Pleistocene man, is today 
in a secondary position as regards social uses, needs, 
and duties. 

This tendency has led unquestionably to a glorification 
of the cerebrospinal, so that hi education, in business 
generally, in industry there has been little appreciation 
of the place and the importance of the autonomic nervous 
system in the life of man. It has produced the scholar 
who sneers at the physical basis of neural elaboration, 
the monk who seeks to give spiritual guidance by living 
a more or less ascetic life; it has evolved the scholastic 
system that omits from the educational curriculum the 
play life of the child. Historically, this tendency has 
given us, as Hetherington suggests, asceticism with its 
degradation of the body, scholasticism with its contempt 
of the physical, and Puritanism with its hatred and fear 
of play, self-expression, and drama. 

Fortunately for man there is a growing appreciation 
of the importance of the autonomic system as a ground- 
work and foundation for the cerebrospinal. The great 
increase in nervous diseases, in nervous breakdowns 
points the way to a new emphasis. The basis of life 
must be made secure. The whole tendency of civiliza- 
tion, with the tremendous growth of industrialism and 
the factory system, with the exhaltation of ' 'system" 
and "efficiency" as guides in production, is to cut straight 
across the essential biologic needs of man, the organism. 
The neurasthenic, the "shell shocked," the nervous 
woman, the irritable man are persons who have taken 
on cerebrospinal activities beyond their capacity for 
accomplishment. 

They need relief from the demands of the environ- 
ment. As Weir Mitchell taught, "They need rest." 

Fundamentally, the cause of this maladjustment is 
twofold. One factor is an inheritance of nerve tissue of 
poor quality. The fact that some individuals break, 
others do not, is a familiar one. The other factor is the 
philosophy of the century. To get ahead, to succeed, to 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 3l5 

become a captain of industry, to achieve the maximum 
production of wealth these guides lead to nervous 
breakdowns and moral disasters. 

The superiority of life on the cerebrospinal plane to 
life on the autonomic level is unquestioned. We can 
never justify a mode of living with health as the end of 
life. To develop the cerebrospinal system to its maximum 
point is the only acceptable ideal, but its foundation 
must never be forgotten. Socrates or Newton, Glad- 
stone or Roosevelt, the common man himself, garbed 
though he be in his own heart as a modern Galahad in 
search of the Grail, will always need a generous partici- 
pation in play, recreation, and physical work sufficient 
to keep the physical organism fit and ready to serve the 
cerebrospinal system to its best development. One 
who seeks to live most and to serve best will be guided 
very largely by this balance of systems. The great 
ideals of achievement and of service should rarely mean 
slow suicide; he only is fit to serve who keeps himself 
at his best. 

Relation of Training to the Health of the Nervous System. 
It is recognized that one may inherit a defective nervous 
system just as well as a defect of the skin, skeleton, or 
musculature. Nature passes on to the offspring the kind 
of characters the parents possess. This fact is immutable. 
Unfortunately, recognition of it serves as an explanatory 
excuse for much undesirable and unhealthful nervous 
response that is due to improper training. Not infre- 
quently bad disposition, moods, temper, or irritability 
in the child are explained or excused, as the case may be, 
by the presence of similar traits in the parent. This 
explanation is based upon a belief in the hereditary 
transmission of the characteristic concerned. It is 
important, therefore, to evaluate the evidence in the 
matter and to determine the significance of training in 
the development of a harmonious well-balanced nervous 
system. 

Bergson states one view of the problem: "Each of us, 



316 PERSONAL SYGtEtfE APPLIED 

glancing back over his history, will find that his child- 
personality, though indivisible, united in itself divers 
persons which could remain blended just because they 
were in their nascent state: this indecision, so charged 
with promise, is one of the greatest charms of childhood. 
But these interwoven personalities become incompatible 
in course of growth, and, as each of us can live but one 
life, a choice must perforce be made. We choose in 
reality without ceasing; without ceasing, also, we abandon 
many things. The route we pursue in time is strewn 
with the remains of all that we began to be, of all that 
we might have been." 

This states the problem as regards the nervous system 
and such matters as "nervousness, " "fears," "moods," 
attitudes, bad tempers, etc. The child who fears lightning 
and thunder probably expresses this instinct of fear 
because the parent was afraid also in the presence of 
the child. 1 Intelligent response by the parent would in 
many cases prevent an instinctive response by the child. 
The bad disposition in the child means usually bad dis- 
position in the home. That is, we are dealing here with 
the effects of training; we are not dealing with biologic 
characters that are immutable. 

It should be remembered, also, that bodily states 
often determine mental and emotional reactions. James 
says, "Our moods and resolutions are more determined 
by the condition of our circulation than by our logical 
grounds." This has its bearing and should receive con- 
sideration. It is quite hi harmony with James' theory 
of the emotions. But, Indeed, the identity of bodily 
states and emotions, both as responses to a situation, 
renders another aspect important. Mental and emo- 
tional states are so closely associated with the physical 
expression of them that even the posture has influence 
on the way one thinks and how one feels. One with a 

1 There is not complete agreement on this point. See Thorndike, 
E. L.: Educational Psychology, Vol. I, pp. 57-68, Teachers Col- 
lege, 1919. 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 317 

depressing mood may speak hopefully and act happy; 
and presently the emotion of joy will come. Thus for 
health and happiness it may be essential to cultivate 
the power to replace moods, to rise above the depression 
of the moment by act of will. 

The health and happiness of the individual are inti- 
mately bound up with the sort of habits and attitudes 
he develops and holds. Education should give all an 
equal opportunity to form proper habits and to develop 
wholesome attitudes. This does not mean uniformity 
in education, nor will it lead to a level of mediocrity. 
There will always be the superior ones who achieve, 
and inferior ones who accomplish little. Both groups 
may be healthy and happy if proper habits and attitudes 
are developed. It is important not to feed boys and girls 
mentally with such fallacies as "All men are created 
equal." Such an attitude leads directly to social unrest, 
social inefficiency, social unhappiness. One person is 
not the equal of another by birth, nor can equality be 
conferred. Each person is just as "good" as he makes 
himself, limited, of course, by heredity and environment. 

The business of government is to supply equality of 
opportunity for all before the law, for service and for 
education. The business of education, as Professor 
Briggs suggests, is to train each individual to his maxi- 
mum, to learn to do better the things he would prob- 
ably do anyway. 

This means definitely as regards one's nervous system 
that one should not try to do work beyond his ability. 
An individual with C grade intelligence in a position 
requiring B grade intelligence is a failure. Socially he is 
inefficient; individually he is unhappy, and with reference 
to his nervous system extremely unhealthy. 

To gain wholesome attitudes concerning home rela- 
tionships and worthy use of leisure, to hold vocation 
and avocation in proper relationship, to develop desir- 
able social and moral qualities, breadth of view, scientific 
appreciations, are the foundations of health of the nervous 



318 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

system. Skill, honesty, diligence, spirit of sportsman- 
ship, courage, self-control, faithfulness, loyalty to high 
ideals, interest in and love for play these are the result 
of training, 1 not of birth. 

Within certain limits anyone may determine the kind 
of nervous system he will have. He may control worry 
by steadfastly refusing to worry over little things; he 
may avoid fears by early abstinence from all indulgence 
of fear; he may surmount an irascible temper, moody 
disposition, or introspective manner by constantly seek- 
ing early and at all times for controlled expression, cheer- 
fulness in life, and the needs of others. 

The Significance of Defective Inheritance in the Nervous 
System. The most favorable training will not compen- 
sate for defects in nerve structure. Numerous examples 
can be given by clinicians of types surviving the stress 
and strain of life's problems in a favorable environment, 
that break completely when subjected to unusual and 
too severe demands. Many miscalled "shell shock' 7 
cases of the World War testify to this fact. It must be 
recognized that many expressions of bad temper and 
bad disposition, as well as bad politics, bad economics, 
and bad sociology are due to defective innervation that 
cannot in the present organization of society be pre- 
vented easily. Numerous instances of this state of 
affairs occurred during the preparedness campaign in 
America before the war and continued even during its 
progress. 

Frequently the conscientious objector and pacifist 
are individuals with defective nervous systems whose 
position is one of personal apology for their own in- 
adequacy. For some, pacifism was a philosophic doctrine 
with rational background in their individual lives before 
the war. For many it served as an excuse for their own 
inability to meet the demands of the social environment. 
Usually the pacifist in war times is the most militant of 

1 See Atlantic Monthly, July, 1921, an article by Theodore 
Knappen on the Morain Park School, Dayton, Ohio. 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 319 

persons in peace, fighting lost causes, posing as a martyr, 
intensely antisocial; even with members of his own 
family his relations are often strained. According to 
his own statements he is frequently misunderstood. 

The pacifistic philosophy even when held by those of 
sound nervous system is frequently so short sighted that 
it cannot see the larger goals beyond the immediate, 
insistent difficulties that must be met. The attitude of 
such people is similar to the one held by numerous per- 
sons to whom the operating-room of a hospital is a place 
of horrors where hideous things are done to living bodies 
with sharp knives. They even regard the surgeon as 
a monster of callousness because he can do such work 
without repulsion. 

The normal mental attitude toward difficult affairs 
of life sees through the dangers, the strains, and the 
uncertainties to the distant goal, the desired end. Thus, 
one would not view war nor operations as ends in them- 
selves, but only imperfect means to other ends more 
worth while than the conditions which provoke the 
war or the operation. Until humanity has evolved among 
men better procedures than those represented by the 
gun and the knife, injustice, slavery, and cancer must 
be met with the tools that are serviceable. The normal 
life will be prepared to meet crises. When the crises 
come, and the stresses and strains weigh heavily ? then 
habits of clear thought, attitudes of social responsibility, 
of honesty in facing problems, and of meeting them 
squarely, will be sane guides and counsellors. 

The Normal Mental Life. The normal mental life 
flows from states of satisfyingness. The healthy state 
of mind is satisfaction with life. Mental activity that 
is hurried, driven, anxious, or depressed, that is charged 
with "long-range apprehensions/' fears, worries, is dis- 
tinctly injurious to health both of mind and of body. 

Now the healthful mental state can be developed 
just as surely as big muscles can be. The process is 
neither so simple nor so easy, but it is not too much 



320 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

to say that most persons can so direct their thoughts 
and so order their lives as to attain, gradually, a higher 
level of control than either their heredity or training 
would have promised. 

Mental training means a training in control, in removal 
of unwholesome states, and in substitution constantly 
of wholesome plans, purposes, and satisfying interests. 

Worry. The most common form of abnormal mental 
functioning is called worry. It represents a situation 
that has been created by civilization with its many "long- 
range apprehensions," fears, and outcomes. It requires 
the direct cultivation and development of a mental 
quality that will offset, neutralize, and render harmless 
the tendency to worry. We cannot put man back to 
the state of the lower animals where only immediate 
danger provides a stimulus. The food-supply next month 
is of no concern to a cow or a camel, it is to man; the 
length of tail or glossiness of fur amounts to nothing at 
all in the immediate jealousies and quarrels of the fox, 
appearance does in man; the wildness in a young colt does 
not cause the sire or dam to lose sleep, it does in man. 

With man, then, the elaboration of the cerebrospinal 
nervous system has brought into the field of mental 
activity fears and anxieties that cannot be met at once; 
they have "long-range" quality. 

Now to such situations there must be presented a 
philosophy of life, a point of view, a characteristic reac- 
tion that will enable the individual to meet the problem, 
whatever it may be. 

It must be clear at the outset that a wholesome mental 
attitude cannot suddenly be acquired. It can never 
be a gift; it is always won. It comes by persistent and 
conscientious effort to see straight, to keep the values 
of life clear. 

Worry may be better understood by analyzing it in 
the common groups in which it most often occurs. They 
are: what we have done, what we are going to do, what 
people think of us, and our health, mental and physical. 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 321 

Worry Over What We Have Done. Worry over some 
work that was done badly or some act that should have 
been omitted is a very common form of worry. It is 
tied up with the third form of worry, the opinion of others, 
because we see the social judgment upon the act or work 
more than our own cognizance of its impropriety or 
inferiority. Now one can lessen worry about what one 
has done only by reflecting briefly, "What is done, is 
done." The mistake should be a lesson and not a sub- 
ject for regrets and recriminations. The experience 
may be made a stepping-stone; worry over it makes it a 
stumbling-block. 

The present and coming generations will have in- 
creasing need of a philosophic faith that will lead from 
mistakes and failures to calm, clear resolution rather 
than to incoherent, aimless wanderings of the mind. 
This generation shows its need for help along this line. 
The faith of our fathers is not strong today. "The Ever- 
lasting Arms" do not appear to be "underneath" bearing 
up the sojourner in life's whirlpools or recesses. The 
constant invention of new religions indicates the demand. 
There is a turning to Christian Science, to the Higher 
Thought, to New Thought, to Psychotherapeutics, to 
Occultism, to Spiritualism even to Epicureanism (let 
us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die). These 
may be effective for simple minds in need of formula; 
the intelligent soul will face the mistake, the act and its 
consequences, and will say, "It's done, but because it's 
ignoble or because it's muddled, or because it's unwhole- 
some, it shall not be done again." No need for hocus 
pocus here. Break your best china then think of a 
lovely rose? No! Such formulae are only for those 
weak spirits who would never be interested in achieving 
intelligent control in life anyway. 

The psychologist is helpful with this type of worry. 

He tells us that the mind is so constituted that a morbid 

memory cannot be driven out by repeating, "I will 

forget it." One thought can only be driven out by another. 

21 



322 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

The stream of consciousness is a stream and is always 
flowing. Selection of a proper subject for mental exami- 
nation or engaging in work of an interesting kind will 
replace the undesirable worry with an acceptable ac- 
tivity. This choice must be conscious, intelligent, and 
directed. 

This form of worry is seen in its simple manifestations 
among those who get up to unlock the door to make sure 
they locked it. Better is it for one to allow a burglar 
to carry the entire house away than to subject one's 
nervous system to such activity. 

It is important to give thought to the morrow, but 
one should practice doing carefully what one has to do 
and then dismissing the matter from the mind. The 
danger of losing mental health must be set over against 
the cost of leaving the gas burning in the hall, or the 
- door unlocked, or the possible errors in the final examina- 
tion. 

Worry Over What We Are Going to Do. Worry about 
a task that is to be done is destructive of the power 
to do the task well. Here again substitution is important. 
One should substitute work on the task for the useless 
fear whether one has sufficient ability for the task or 
not. To size up the work, to decide to do it, and then 
to start is the beginning of successful accomplishment. 
One should avoid spending too much time deciding 
what to do. A proper amount of attention should be 
given to consideration of the thing to be done, and then 
one should pounce upon it. A mistake may be made; 
others make mistakes. Important questions have been 
and probably often will be decided wrong. 

The young person who worries about success prevents 
himself from succeeding. The whirling, interesting 
present moment is the treasure to grasp. The yester- 
day with its failures, the morrow with its unknown, 
are to be passed by. Life is here and now. One who 
exists now only to live at some future time misses the 
great opportunity. The training one puts oneself through

is life, not a preparation for life. This very moment 
will never come again. Even now it is gone. The hand 
that writes, the eye that sees this line cannot bring it 
back. Here and now is life fill it full of "work, of play, 
of love, of worship." 1 The summum bonum is Happi- 
ness. 2 Not the base kind that smacks of race tracks, 
wine, music halls, and commercialized vice. But rather 
the kind that Saleeby speaks of, 3 "There is no human 
end but happiness, high or low. Its one absolute negation 
is neither poverty nor ill-health, nor material failure, 
nor yet starvation 'he that is of a merry heart hath a 
continual feast/ The one absolute negation of happiness 
is worry or discontent. A prosperous society consisting 
of strenuous worried business men who have no time to 
play with their children, or listen to great music, or 
gaze upon the noble face of the sky, or commune with 
the soul ... of which another poet, Wordsworth, 
said that it was 'like a star that dwelt apart' such a 
society may be as efficient as a bee-hive, as large as 
London and as wealthy, but it stultifies its own ends,, 
and would be better not at all. 'Better a handful with 
quietness than both the hands full with travail and 
vexation of spirit/ ' We might well say of happiness 
as Emerson said of the beautiful, "Though we travel 
the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it 
with us, or we find it not." 

Worry over what we are to do may take various torms. 
At times it will be directed at vocations; at other times 
it is greatly exercised over the problem of marriage. 
These are important problems. They are not to be 
solved out of hand, nor do they admit of continual analysis. 

1 Cabot, R.: What Men Live By, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 
1914. 

2 Henri Poincare* starts one of his recent books with the remark 
that the chief aim of man is to search for truth. Truth and happiness 
are very much akin when truth in concrete forms is" directed in the 
service of man and happiness remains truthful, free from sham, and 
the similitudes of mere smiles.

f 

To find one's best work where the tasks will have meaning 
and the compensations are paid in happiness and joy 
is not easy. But worry over the outcome of a vocation 
prevents any careful study of the vocation, its special 
requirements, its fields of opportunity and responsibility. 
The choice of a life mate causes less worry as a rule 
than the choice of a vocation because the former is so 
often an emotional act rather than an intellectual judg- 
ment. The worry comes more often after the choice 
has been made. More intelligence and less emotion 
before and less analysis and more love after marriage 
would probably decrease if not entirely eliminate worry 
in this field. 

Worry Over the Opinions of Others. A friend of mine 
keeps on his desk a card index of data that he is con- 
stantly using. Under the section C he has a card headed 
"Criticisms." There he has written from time to time 
criticisms of his work, his manner, his personality. Some 
have been very helpful; others have been silly in his 
judgment. The only intelligent response to others' 
opinions is to be thankful for the criticism. If it is good, 
use it; if it is silly, throw it into the waste basket. 

The danger to mental health of being sensitive to 
criticism cannot be overstated. Most persons do not 
appreciate the mental damage that comes from nursing 
a slight or mulling over in the mind a fancied wrong. 
One should avoid moods and poutings as one would the 
plague. 

If someone has spoken unjustly, unfairly, one should 
classify the criticism as foolish and the critic as unreason- 
able and forget it. If the criticism is a just one, one 
should swallow one's pride, bow the knee, and learn. 
It is not a question of courage, it is a question of per- 
spective. As Theodore Roosevelt 1 would say, "It is a 
question of the major interest driving out the minor 
interest."

Scribner's Sons, New York, 1921, p. 274. 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 25 

Women need to be particularly alive to this matter 
of criticism. All sensitive natures must cultivate the 
unheroic and commonplace. One cannot with any safety 
indulge in the melancholy pleasure of playing the martyr. 
I know a woman who always seeks out difficult and 
burdensome tasks, so she can say afterward, "Oh, how 
hard it was! No one knows how I have suffered." For 
such there is no mental poise, no happiness at all until 
the relation of self to the world has been adjusted. 

Worry Over Health. It is important to form the habit 
of taking the health of mind and body for what it is 
and making the best of it. True, if the condition can be 
improved, the most careful and scientific care should 
be used to restore it entirely. But useless fear and worry 
not only prevent the development of the best health, 
but, indeed, produce disturbances that are quite dis- 
tressing. 

Whenever the activity of the cerebrospinal system 
flows over into the realm of autonomic control a precious 
balance and harmony are disturbed. The nutritive 
processes of life are designed to go on without conscious 
direction. The beating of the heart, breathing, digestion, 
peristalsis, liver activity, excretion, and other functional 
activities are controlled by the autonomic system and 
spinal cord. The higher centers should at no time be 
conscious of them or concerned about them. Saleeby 1 
says, "Those bodily processes and functions which are 
under the control of the lower levels of the nervous system 
are best performed when those lower levels are left un- 
disturbed by orders from above. This is true not only 
of such functions as sleep and digestion but also of other 
functions which, at one time in the history of the individ- 
ual, have required the most direct and p'ainstaking efforts 
of conscious attention." 

Functional diseases of the nervous system are fre- 
quently caused by worry. Both hysteria and neurasthenia 
result from worry. The following question and answer

At that time I had typhoid fever and pneumonia. It left me with 
nervous trouble and which I have tried hard to overcome. I cannot 
go any place because I get nervous. It seems to work on the stomach. 
There is a beating and I always feel as if I have to vomit. Do you

REPLY 

Taking medicine will do you no good. You are a neurasthenic 
and you suffer from anxieties and fears. You can be cured, but it 
will take tune. It is a matter of mental and social training. If you 
get in the line of such training and have the patience and persever- 
ance to stick, you can win. There are bushels of religions, philos- 
ophies, cults, and such suited to just your kind of people. 

The emotional person will often require a symbol, 
creed, or formula by which to guide life; the person with 
matured intelligence, with rational guides, will not 
require any hocus pocus, but will, by volitional power, 
force himself to think properly, to control emotions, 
and to banish fears. The neurotic person who is unable 
to or does not desire to heal himself should in every 
instance engage the services of a scientific physician who 
commands the respect of the patient by the power of his 
personality. 2 Psychologists recognize this power and 
call it suggestion. The skilful physician uses suggestion 
in functional disturbances. Such a procedure for the 
neurotic will secure the service that a magic cult would 
give and, in addition, it would provide that medical 
care which will be needed in the advent of a real organic 
disease. 

Worry over one's health leads inevitably to increased

disturbance of body functions. Hysteria, neurasthenia, 
hypochondria, with its many fears, are matters of gradual 
growth. They are not suddenly developed out of hand. 

One who allows oneself to worry about small matters, 
who expects heart disease or deafness from every sore 
throat, is laying a foundation in abnormal mental reac- 
tions for unhappiness and ill health. 

Development of Wholesome Mental Habits. It is 
quite possible for many persons to develop wholesome 
mental responses and for many to achieve a higher type 
of control than the usual and customary. The secret 
lies in holding even, in unimportant situations, the un- 
emotional, sane, intelligent attitude. Saleeby 1 says, 
"It is pre-eminent necessity for the irradiation amongst 
the people of that fine temper, half philosophic, half 
religious, half intellectual, half emotional, half rational 
acceptance, half faith the faith of Socrates that to the 
good man no evil thing can happen the temper that 
possessed the soul of Wordsworth, who, whilst others 
were distressed, disheartened, at the betrayal of a patriot, 
addressed him in these great words: 

" 'There's not a breathing of the common wind 
That will forget thee; thou hast great allies; 
Thy friends are exultations, agonies, 
And love, and man's unconquerable mind.' " 

To train oneself in small things to meet the problems 
of life is the beginning of that power which in the crises 
of life will find the owner strong, able, and sufficient. 
Such training should be begun in childhood. 2 Situations 
should be met by boys and girls without allowing them 
to expect the rescuing hand. 3 

A list of wholesome mental traits important for health 
will not satisfy everyone, perhaps, but the following

appear significant: confidence, faith in the goodness 
of life, open-mindedness, and unselfishness. 

Confidence. Confidence in self, in one's power, in the 
intrinsic value and worthwhileness of one's own. per- 
sonality is essential for the most abundant life. It was 
the principle that Jesus taught in his insistence upon the 
love of the Father for each person. This belief in one's 
power and one's worth lies at the foundation of all 
worthwhile work and accomplishment. 

Experimentally, its value has been determined. Give 
a subject a puzzle, and if he says, "I don't suppose I 
can do it," he renders his mind less able to discover the 
means for its solution. He may even insist that it can't 
be done. If inadvertently he solves the puzzle, but hasn't 
learned the process, he will attack it with more con- 
fidence. The experience of success increases his con- 
fidence. 

This fact has significant meaning for education. It 
suggests one reason for the large number of persons who 
lack grit, courage, confidence. It corroborates the views 
of Goddard 1 with respect to the necessity for vocational 
training and adjustment. 

The only way to develop confidence is to try honestly, 
and to keep at it until the experience of success comes. 
Reasonable intelligence would prevent selection of work 
for which one was wholly unsuited, and from which no 
success to mention could be expected. 

Faith in the Goodness of Life. Faith in the goodness 
of life, here and now, will be based upon an understanding 
of man's relation to man and to God. It will not con- 
sider this world an evil from which an escape is Nirvana 
to the soul. Rather it will hold the pulsing moment 
to be real life in which all that one most desires is en- 
shrined. The devastating war, the serious disease, the 
broken promise, the unrequited love, are but incidents 
to the man with faith in the goodness of life, whose

THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 329 

course is chartered not by individual suffering, shame, 
or joy, but by the progress of the race. 

What happens to the individual is important, but 
what happens to the race of man is supreme. Viewing 
that, one should see with Tennyson 

"That nothing waiks with aimless feet, 
That not one life shall be destroyed 
Or cast as rubbish to the void 
Till God hath made the pile complete." 

and with Browning when he sings, 

"God's in His Heaven, 
All's right with the world." 

The path to faith in the goodness of life lies among 
the commonplace every-day affairs of work and play. 
The exotic, the bizarre, sensational course must be 
avoided. The simple life, as Pastor Wagner 1 taught, 
makes for such faith. 

Faith in the goodness of life means optimism. It is 
not the optimism of the Christian Scientist who says 
that all things are beautiful. Values need not be mixed 
in that way. All things are not beautiful. Many things 
are rotten, ugly, and totally to be condemned. Optimism 
means joy in the wonderful things of life, of which there 
are many. 

Nothing is quite so destructive of real happiness and 
health of mind as pessimism. Doubt, fear, and self- 
consciousness are the plague-demons of joy. On the 
contrary, play, laughter, lack of a dull seriousness are 
the tonic needed by the jaded nerves of civilized man. 
Those who can play (and play is a psychologic attitude) 
live, they burn; others only smoulder. 

Bangs' poem of a happy child strikes the note for this 
faith that is the testimony of poets and the scientific 
record of physicians: 

1 Wagner, Charles: The Simple Life, McClure, Phillips & Co.,

"I do not sorrow when there's snow 
Or rain, or fog, or sleet, 
There are more toys at home, you know, 
Than out there on the street. 

"So whether we have bright sunshine, 
Or clouds all through the day, 
I never sorrow or repine, 
But play, and play, and play." 

Open-mindedness. Open-mindedness and breadth of 
view make for sanity. The restricted vision, the institu- 
tionalized mind, continually clashes with the growing 
liberalism in the world. It will increasingly clash be- 
cause asceticism, scholasticism, and Puritanism are 
meeting everywhere the opposition of minds freed from 
the traditional. To keep an open mind means to be willing 
to accept any new proposal, however at variance with 
established belief or custom, whenever the new presents 
facts to sustain its contention. The open mind will 
see the facts, will not close itself off from the facts. It 
prevents thereby the rigidity of mind so allied to the 
fixed idea of the insane. Open-mindedness means plas- 
ticity of mind, ability to see new relationships, to feel 
new meanings, to find new values. It makes for variety, 
interest, and health. 

Unselfishness. Finally, unselfishness as an attitude 
is to be cultivated because of its wholesome effect on 
health. It may be warranted on moral and social grounds, 
but aside from these justifications it lies at the very root of 
satisfactions in life. Mental growth and mental health 
feed on satisfying situations. The permanent satisfactions 
in modern society come from unselfish service to the 
world. In a primitive society the original instincts for 
selfish ends would be more satisfying, but today the 
selfish person erects a splendid isolation around himself, 
that leaves him, because of the very gregariousness of 
man, an unhappy, disgruntled, and unwholesome soul. 

There seem to be at the very foundation of all whole- 
some mental life confidence and belief in self, faith in 
the goodness of the world, open-mindedness and breadth 



THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 331 

of view, and unselfishness. To others may appear other 
values. It is for all to choose. What roads we travel 
matters very little. That we arrive at our desired goal 
and that the goal shall be worth while this is the test. 

Insanity. Insanity is a mental disease with such 
departures of mental functioning from the normal that 
the whole personality of the individual is changed. This 
change is usually gradual. Commonly it is looked upon 
as sudden, peculiar, and mysterious. Quite the contrary 
is the case. It is the logical result of changes occurring 
in the brain, its causes are, in the main, well known, and 
it comes as a gradual deterioration. Many of the insane 
in hospitals today might have retained their mental 
health if they had known the necessary facts and had 
acted in accordance with them. 

In insanity there are two elements involved the 
predisposing and the exciting. "The predisposing are 
the inherited and acquired abnormalities of the individual, 
while the exciting are to be found in the storms and 
stresses of life. Of these two the first must positively 
be present, but not always being evident, it is often 
overlooked, and it is the second or the exciting cause, 
itself relatively unimportant, that is held in popular 
belief, generally alone responsible. Thus we hear of 
persons 'going insane' from grief and from disappoint- 
ment, from fear and from shock; but, while it is true 
that without something of these the disease might never 
have developed, it is equally true that none of them 
alone can bring it on. Storm and stress factors enter 
into the development of practically all mental disorders, 
both mild and severe, but they are only factors, the 
ultimate causes lie deeper." 1 

Types of Insanity. The types of insanity are fairly 
well defined. De Fursac 2 suggests a classification that 
is used as a basis for the simplification given below:

1. Psychoses based upon defective nervous tissue, called morbid 

predisposition or constitutional psychopathic condition. In 
this group are paranoia, manic depressive insanity, obsessions, 
sexual perversions, and mental instability. Mental hygiene 
is most important in this group. 

2. Psychoses based upon toxic or infectious processes. In the 

former are alcoholism, morphinomania, and cocainomania, 
and in the latter, infections such as typhoid, diphtheria, 
hydrophobia, influenza, and tuberculosis. Personal hygiene 
is very important in this group. 

3. Psychoses based upon syphilitic infection, as seen in general 

paralysis (paresis) and locomotor ataxia. Personal and 
social hygiene are important in this group. 

4. Psychoses based upon auto-intoxication (Kraepelin's view), such 

as dementia prsecox. This condition occurs usually before 
the age of twenty-five and rarely after thirty. It follows a 
poisoning of the body, at times after a severe infection, as 
scarlet fever, or at other times a disorder of the sex glands 
seems to be the factor, as indicated by its appearance at 
puberty or in the female at the first childbirth. Meyer 1 
believes that this type belongs more properly with the 
constitutional psychopathic group (Group 1 above). 

5. Psychoses of involution, such as affective melancholia and 

senile dementia. 

Causes of Insanity. The causes 2 of insanity are known 
in the main. Omitting heredity, they may be considered 
under four headings: 

Syphilis. Paresis, often called general paralysis, and 
popularly known as "softening of the brain," accounts 
for about 20 per cent, of the insane admitted to state 
hospitals. Syphilis as a factor may be considered even 
more important because of its relation to tabes dorsalis 
and the mental deterioration that comes in the late 
stages of this condition. Syphilis is a common infection; 
insanity, a relatively rare condition. The disease may 
be expended upon other organs than the brain, but when 
it attacks the brain some form of mental disturbance 
is bound to result. 

In the main, syphilis is recognized as the cause of 
paresis. The disease at this stage is incurable by any

THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 333 

means known to medical science. The brain tissue has 
been changed, and when once altered, it is thereafter 
impossible to restore it to normal. 

This causative factor causes serious destruction to 
other organs of the body, namely, the heart, liver, blood- 
vessels, and bones. It presents a problem not only to 
the individual but also to society that should challenge 
the most intelligent effort for diagnosis, isolation, and 
treatment. 1 Its frequent connection with immoral 
living and its certain moral and social censure of the 
infected individual are the factors that have prevented 
a rational administration by boards of health. In the 
light of all the unhappiness, ill health, and early deaths 
caused by the disease it is not too much to say that it 
should be treated according to the established principles 
of communicable disease control. 

A pamphlet prepared by the Committee on Mental 
Hygiene of the State Charities Aid Association (N. Y.) 
gives the following as additional causes of insanity. 
This pamphlet is authoritative, having the endorsement 
of leading psychiatrists and neurologists: 

Alcohol and Other Poisons. Another group of mental 
diseases are due directly to the habitual use of alcohol. 
Alcoholic insanity may be brought on by the regular 
use of alcohol even in ' 'moderate" quantities not pro- 
ducing intoxication. The close relation between alcohol 
and insanity has only recently been fully realized. 
Statistics as to the number of cases in which alcohol 
is the direct cause necessarily vary in different localities. 
Fully 30 per cent, of the men and 10 per cent, of the 
women admitted to the State Hospitals are suffering 
from conditions due directly or indirectly to alcohol. 
So marked is the effect of alcohol upon the brain and

the nerve tissue that it helps to bring about a number 
of mental breakdowns in addition to the alcoholic in- 
sanities. Alcohol is a poison. A long series of careful 
tests 1 performed by eminent authorities showed that 
even small quantities of alcohol may lower the mental 
capacity, and that it takes much longer than is usually 
supposed for this effect to wear off. 

In this day of keen competition every man needs the 
highest possible development of his mental capacities. 
Not only is the highest mental development impossible 
with the continued use of alcohol, but impairment of 
the mental faculties is likely to follow. 

Other poisons, such as opium, morphin, and cocain, 
which, with alcohol, are the principal parts of many 
patent remedies, often weaken the mental powers and 
produce insanity. 

Physical Diseases. Some mental breakdowns may be 
traced to the effects of other physical diseases. Typhoid 
fever, influenza, diphtheria, and some other diseases 
often so poison the system that for some time after the 
disease itself has left, the regular functions of the body 
are seriously interfered with. It is probable, also, that 
the poisons so produced interfere with the nervous system. 
Consequently, a mental breakdown is sometimes a 
delayed result of such diseases. Among other physical 
causes of insanity are tuberculosis and diseases of the 
arteries, heart, and kidneys. Aside from the direct 
physical effect of these diseases, they have a tendency to 
disturb the mind by discouragement. A person suffering, 
from any such disease should have good nursing, skilled 
medical treatment, pleasant surroundings, and freedom 
from anxiety. Often these can be had only in a hospital. 
Prejudice against hospital care is largely unjustified. 

Overwork is often spoken of as a cause of insanity. 
This is not correct. 2 Hard work alone rarely causes a

York, 1919, pp. 407^13.

THE HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 335 

nervous breakdown. It only becomes a menace to health 
when associated with worry and loss of sleep, or causes 
mentioned under other headings. 

The control of infectious diseases, protection of food 
and water supplies, temperance, and healthful home and 
factories, all these help to prevent mental as well as 
physical diseases. 

Mental Habits. Aside from physical causes there 
are also mental causes. They are the most important 
causes of some forms of insanity. The healthy state of 
mind is one of satisfaction with life. This does not depend 
so much upon our surroundings, or how much money 
we have, or how many troubles come to us, as upon 
the way in which we train ourselves to deal with diffi- 
culties and troubles. Anyone who departs too far from 
this state of satisfaction must be regarded as tending 
toward an unhealthy condition. Of course, not all 
persons start with the same kind of mental makeup. 
Some, owing to heredity, unusual experiences, or bad 
training, have what is called a morbid disposition. But 
disposition is not something fixed like the color of our 
eyes. It must be looked upon as made up of many ten- 
dencies which often can be changed or modified by 
training and proper mental habits. Health is a duty 
which the individual owes to himself and to others. 
Mental health is as important as physical health. The 
average person little realizes the danger of brooding 
over slights, injuries, disappointments, or misfortunes, 
or of lack of frankness, or of an unnatural attitude toward 
his fellowmen, shown by unusual sensitiveness or marked 
suspicion. Yet all these unwholesome and painful trains 
of thought may, if persisted in and unrelieved by healthy 
interests and activities, tend toward insanity. Whole- 
some work relieved by periods of rest and simple pleasures, 
and an interest in the affairs of others, are important 
preventives of unwholesome ways of thinking. 

Alcohol and the Nervous System. The alcohol prob- 
lem has not been settled by prohibition. It will be settled 



336 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

only by education. The eighteenth amendment is the 
quick way to remove the deterioration in human life; 
it must be supplemented by the continued effort of 
education. 

Alcohol presents a social problem that cannot be 
treated at this time. Evaluation of its relation to poverty, 
immorality, crime, and general unhappiness is a matter 
of social economy. What are the facts regarding the 
effects of alcohol upon the health of the user? 

The chief effects are seen in the nervous system. Diges- 
tive tract and circulatory system show untoward changes 
from alcohol, but the nervous system is mainly attacked. 
Legrain 1 made a careful study of the effects of alcohol 
on the nervous system, and presented data that should 
be considered carefully by the opponents of prohibition. 

The external effects show in the irritability, the in- 
creased susceptibility to disease, the lowered vitality. 
The internal effects are more marked, and of most signifi- 
cance are the experiments of Professor Stockard of the 
Cornell University Medical School, which show the 
influence of alcohol as a detrimental factor in inheritance. 

Professor Stockard 2 has proved that the germ cells 
of males can be so injured by allowing the individual 
to inhale the fumes of alcohol that they give rise to 
defective offspring although mated with vigorous un- 
treated females. In commenting on this work the 
Journal of the American Medical Association 3 said, 

"The extension of these unique investigations, in which the 
offspring from the treated animals which reach maturity are usually 
nervous and slightly undersized, have further shown that the effect 
of the injury of the germ cells is not only exhibited by the im- 
mediate offspring of alcoholized animals, but is conveyed through 
their descendants for at least three generations. There are many 
instances of matings followed by negative results or early abortions,

stillborn young, or defectives. An instructive illustration was 
afforded in a case in which two of the four young were completely 
eyeless, the eyeballs, optic nerves, and chiasma being absent. Such 
defects result, according to Stockard, from the injury originally in- 
flicted on the germ cells by the experimental treatment. Yet this 
injury may have been received by early generations only. Thus 
the parents of the anophthalmic guinea-pigs just mentioned were 
untreated, their four grandparents were also untreated, but their 
great-grandfathers were all alcoholized and the great-grandmothers 
were all normal animals. The defective eyes of descendants are due 
to impaired development, not to the direct action of alcohol. Plainly 
the spermatozoon is actually weakened if not disabled by the 
alcohol treatment and all individuals arising from combinations in- 
volving such a germ cell are likely to be below normal. There is 
food for reflection in these facts." 

The scientific evidence is available. Alcohol is not a 
food (it burns too fast for the human machine), it poisons 
the highest centers, and sets free the lowest instincts 
by removing the inhibitions and controls of the brain. 
It is in the same position, so far as social approval may 
go, with the use of cocain, morphin, and other drugs. 
The classical study of the effects of alcohol by Dodge 
and Benedict 1 may serve as the scientific basis for the 
determination of action by all rational minds. 

The modern view of health that is sustained largely 
by an ideal of social responsibility rejects the fallacious 
argument for personal liberty. Oh, Liberty, how many 
crimes are committed in thy name! Liberty does not 
mean the right to do as one pleases, but rather an oppor- 
tunity to develop to the highest and secure the greatest 
happiness in life so long as other members in society 
are not injured. Ideas or odors cannot be deported, 
but one can get rid of the source of the disturbance, 
and then eradicate the effects. The most needed thing 
today in connection with the alcohol problem is educa- 
tion that will make the deportation effective and the 
eradication complete.

A Difficulty of Terminology. The hygiene of the 
reproductive system would be the logical term to use in 
sequence to the previous chapters, but here, as elsewhere, 
the logical does not always serve. The hygiene of the 
reproductive system would relate to the care of the 
reproductive organs, to menstruation, to pregnancy 
and labor, and to the prevention of disease. The sex 
instincts, however, relate to the whole of life and touch 
problems that reach into all aspects of life. The hygiene 
of the sexual aspects of life, known as social hygiene, 
concerns itself not only with the hygiene of organs, but 
indeed also with the institution of marriage, social cus- 
toms, prostitution, perhaps even the Malthusian move- 
ment. The finest forms of life can develop only where 
work, play, friendship, love, and worship are continually 
expressed in fine forms and under high standards. 

A newer concept of social hygiene has come in recent 
years in the social hygiene movement itself. In a report 
on Social Hygiene Education 1 the following is found 
under the heading "Fundamental Principles of Social 
Hygiene Education": 

teachers College Bulletin, Twelfth Series, No. 13, Teachers 
College, New York, 1920.

HYGIENE OF THE SEXUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE 339 

"Meaning of social hygiene: The American social 
hygiene movement aims at the best possible develop- 
ment of all physical, psychical, and social aspects of life 
as it is determined or influenced, directly or indirectly, 
by the sexual instincts and related traditions. 

11 Sex hygiene education or sex-education in its largest 
sense includes all scientific, social (including ethical), 
and religious instruction and influence which directly 
and indirectly may help young people prepare to meet 
the problems of life that have their center in the sexual 
instinct, and inevitably come into the life of every normal 
human being." 

The Sex Instinct in Life. If the instincts of man be 
studied, it will be found that they group themselves 
into two categories one looking toward preservation 
of the individual, the other toward perpetuation of the 
race. The first is personal, real, and conscious of its end; 
the second is personal, real, but largely unconscious. 

Freud claims that the sex instinct is the root of all 
life, the energy for all activity, whether sexual, intellectual, 
or physical. Many feel that he claims too great a hierarchy 
for sex, but all students of life also know that this instinct 
is not a simple thing at all, but that it is, at least in its 
expressions, bound up with most of the human problems 
of the sexes. 

The life impulse has worked itself out in a variety of 
ways. In the vegetable world there are asexual and 
sexual forms of reproduction providing for the perpetua- 
tion of the species without the guidance of instinct or 
intelligence. In the animal kingdom the maintenance 
of species has been entrusted to the sex instinct. With 
the lower animals this instinct is marvelous in its skill 
in acquiring just the proper conditions for effective action. 
The beetle Sitaris is a wonderful illustration of the power 
of this instinct to provide for life, to satisfy its essential 
purpose. 1 

1 Bergson, H.: Creative Evolution, Henry Holt <& Co.. New York, 
1913, p. 146. 



340 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

With man, however, nature departed from her scheme 
of the animal world by bringing in intelligence. If in- 
stinct had ruled in the primates such as man, there would 
not, of course, be the civilized life of a modern man, 
the social disharmonies, prostitution, and the whole 
chain of social ills that have arisen for modern man. 
Instinct in man as the supreme force would have given 
a life comparable to that of the lower animals. The 
development of intelligence made possible the forms of 
civilized life, the economic achievements of society, and 
the moral and social advances of the race. The chasm 
between instinct and intelligence as used in human life 
accounts for most of the social disorders of the race. 

Sex conduct if guided only by instinctive urge is on 
the level of lower animal life; if directed by intelligence 
and the forces of the affective life, it can be made to 
contribute to life values in the same way that intelligence 
has enriched life in other fields. 

There are those who are willing to attribute to man 
power for fine controls in aspects of life other than sex, 
but who insist "we have always had these disharmonies 
and always must have them." They frequently end by 
saying, "Human nature is human nature." Such a 
person is thinking on a level with the inhabitants of the 
age described by Lecky in his History of European 
Morals. 

It is probably true that the whole of life, sex, emotions, 
spirit, work, play, and love are best achieved and best 
expressed when intelligence rules and guides and when 
the purely instinctive elements are controlled. More- 
over, evolution is continually developing such control. 
Human conduct today is different from the human 
conduct of two thousand years ago. The young person 
interested in achieving the finest life must be guided 
by the compelling dictates of intelligence and not by the 
force of instinct in all manifestations of sex in life. This 
will mean, then, that intelligence is to control, to direct, 
to approve, or disapprove of instinctive desire. This 



HYGIENE OF THE SEXUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE 341 

progress will come mainly through an enrichment of our 
social inheritance. 

New Interpretations of Sex. The instinct of sex 
denotes a great desire. Its free expression because of 
social ills produced has been subjected to almost uni- 
versal disapproval. Its very reality has been viewed 
with apprehension. The scholastic doctrine that we are 
conceived in sin drew the lines that determined the 
picture of all sex activity. Platt 1 speaks of this peculiar 
view in the following words: 

"So far are the extremities of the sexual function 
separated in man's mind that the first step, its inception, 
has always been counted as more or less shameful, and 
the last step, its culmination, has been esteemed as a 
blessing. Gods and heroes have been gloriously born 
into this world, but so firmly is the idea of an unworthy, 
carnal lust attached to the beginning of the great miracle 
of nature that theologians and peoples have always 
felt it necessary to provide for them a supernatural or 
immaculate conception. " 

Science recognizes no such interpretation of nature. 
For the intelligent no value is conserved by such dis- 
torted view. Rather, must there come into our con- 
sciousness an appreciation of the beautiful aspects of 
sex. The sexual life in man must be concieved as a differ- 
ent sort of thing entirely than that among the lower 
animals. True, it issues in the production of new in- 
dividuals, but just because man is man, a being of intelli- 
gence, it differs in its "high spiritual meaning and pur- 
pose." 

It is just this thought that prompts the following 
statement of fundamental principles in the Report on 
Social Hygiene Education 2 : 

"Human meanings of sex: It is only by frankly

recognizing and developing the psychical and social and 
esthetic (meanings of sex, that are distinctly human and 
superadded to the merely propagative function of the 
animal, that people can be led far away from the almost 
universal secrecy, disrespect, vulgarity, and irreverence 
concerning every aspect of sex in human life. Sex in- 
stincts and processes are essentially pure and beautiful 
phases of that wonderful something we call 'Life/ 
Sex-education should aim to give this esthetic attitude 
by presenting life as fundamentally free from the deg- 
radation arising from the common misuse and mis- 
understanding of the sexual nature." 

The Institution of Marriage. Marriage is a human 
institution serving in the establishment of homes and 
the rearing of children. 1 It has profound possibilities 
for unhappiness and social distresses; it has sublime 
possibilities for happiness and social progress. Prob- 
ably its values far outweigh its failures; certainly society 
would be less satisfying for all without marriage. In 
the paragraphs that can be devoted to its discussion 
in this book only a few outlines can be traced; adequate 
treatment would require a volume in itself. Yet in a 
little space some very important matters affecting health 
and happiness can be set forth. 

There is a need for a broad general understanding 
of marriage by young men and women. 2 What does it 
mean? What does it give? What does it require? First 
and foremost in any catechism of marriage would appear 
the statement: Young people should value, in the opposite 
sex, things other than the sexual merely. Sex attraction 
is not enough to be satisfying for the whole of life. Winds 
of feeling are not fair weather for the matrimonial venture. 
They are too gusty. The human vessel needs the support

of an auxiliary engine supplying appropriate power in 
the form of interests and ideals. 

Marked incompatibilities should be avoided: The 
man interested in camping, out-of-doors, and the woman 
not interested; the woman fine in her appreciations, 
manner, and standards, and the man coarse; the woman 
artistic, and the man crude; the man ambitious, produc- 
tive, with a strong social sense, and the woman a creature 
of decoration, only to be entertained. The power of the 
sex appeal is often not great enough to hold together in 
comradeship, happiness, and enduring love the man 
and woman of no common general interests. 

The young man and young woman should have enough 
imagination to see that married life is not one continual 
act of love making in the usual sense of that term. That 
there should be expression of love cannot be denied, 
but the broad general common interests of life are the 
channels through which love may be continually set 
free and expressed, and true comradeship developed. 

There are those who would have marriage to begin 
and to end at will. At the other extreme are the ortho- 
doxists who would make of it an indissoluble bond. 
Perhaps somewhere between lies the golden mean in 
which all the social and all the individual values will 
be preserved. Certainly there will be less reason for 
extreme positions if the male-made double standard of 
morals can be abolished, and if the male-made institu- 
tion of prostitution can be broken down. Marriage 
can mean all that it ought to mean if one principle is 
remembered: Everything exchanged between husband 
and wife can only be the free gift of love, can never be 
demanded as a right. 1 Love never demands. The 
tenderness of love, the thoughtfulness of love, the sacrifice 
of love are the portals to love itself. 

When shall young people marry? Biologically they 
are prepared to assume the reproductive functions in 

1 The thought is expressed by Ellen Key in her book, The Morality 
of Women, Ralph Seymour Co., Chicago, 1921. 



344 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

adolescence. But society with its economic demands, 
its plans of education, its organization of trades, occupa- 
tions, and professions has gradually prolonged the mar- 
riageable age. The young man should never feel that 
he has solved the control of the sex impulse by marriage; 
he has as great or greater need for control after marriage. 
This control is necessary during certain physiologic 
periods and also during pregnancy. 

Menstruation. For the woman the menstrual period 
involves certain marked physiologic changes. These 
are more marked on the psychic side in the few days 
before the period. During the period the woman should 
live the usual life if possible, avoiding undue fatigue, 
work, or strain. Vigorous running and jumping are 
not to be advised, and yet moderate exercise is helpful. 

It is entirely correct to bathe the body at this time 
and to keep clean. This should be accomplished by a 
sponge bath, avoiding the tub and shower. During this 
period the feet should be kept dry, the body not exposed 
to cold, and plenty of rest in sleep indulged at night. 

Pregnancy. During pregnancy exercise should be 
continued daily and plenty of time spent out of doors 
at least a walk of two miles, and one hour in the open 
air if possible. The diet should be supervised and the 
condition of the patient carefully determined by the 
physician in charge. After the birth of the child every 
reasonable effort should be made to nurse the baby 
because the child has more chances for life and, more- 
over, it is better for the mother. 1 

The Social or Venereal Diseases. The social diseases, 
gonorrhea and syphilis, are, in the main, diseases con- 
tracted in clandestine or organized prostitution. Some 
cases are acquired asexually, but they are, in the main, 
the vaginitis 2 cases seen in institutions for girls, such

Bureau, U. S. Department of Labor, Washington, D. C.

caused by the gonococcus. Relationship not definitely determined. 



HYGIENE OF THE SEXUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE 345 

as asylums or orphanages. Commercialized or clandestine 
prostitution provide the chief infections. 

The venereal diseases constitute one of the most serious 
handicaps and hazards for any health plan that con- 
fronts society today. The extent of these diseases can- 
not accurately be stated. That it is very great is sug- 
gested by the number of cases of gonorrhea ophthalmia 
and syphilitic insane, by the sterility in men and women, 
and by the abdominal operations on women occasioned 
by gonorrhea. It has been estimated that a large pro- 
portion of the operations on married women for abdominal 
conditions are occasioned by gonorrhea transmitted 
by the husband, supposedly cured of the disease. The 
extent of the infection in the nation is not accurately 
known, but the possible and frequent results of the in- 
fection is a well-known medical fact. 

Gonorrhea. This disease is caused by the gonococcus, 
an organism that is grown with difficulty in artificial 
media, that dies soon on exposure outside the body, but 
that grows with rapidity on the mucous membrane 
of the genito-urinary tract and on the mucous membrane 
of the eyes. 

Contrary to popular opinion, it is not an insignificant 
disease. The initial symptoms may pass quickly, but 
the complications are serious and almost always result. 
In the male there may occur stricture of the urinary 
passage, involvement of the prostate gland, and infection 
of the sperm ducts leading from the testes, producing 
sterility at times. The disease may extend throughout 
the body, involving the joints and producing an inflam- 
mation that results frequently in stiffness and loss of 
motor function. At times the heart itself is involved, 
and less frequently other body structures. 

The disease is exceedingly difficult to cure. Even 
after all the symptoms have cleared up gonococci may 
still remain in the prostatic glands; when discharged 
later, they are able to produce the disease. A cure can 
be prognosticated only after two tests have been made: 



346 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

1. Massage of the prostate and examination of the secretion under 

the microscope for gonococci. 

2. The complement-fixation test for gonorrhea. 

In the female the complications may result more 
disastrously. In addition to the local disturbance, 
infection of the tubes and ovaries is almost certain to 
occur. This results frequently in sterility, and often 
requires an abdominal operation for removal of the 
diseased organ. Not infrequently the removal of both 
ovaries is necessary, thus producing an artificial meno- 
pause, and causing the woman continuous ill health 
and nervous disturbances. 

In the female treatment is very unsatisfactory. Some 
gynecologists question if a complete cure is ever secured; 
all recognize its extreme difficulty. 

For any young person to look upon this disease as 
insignificant, and to ignore the scientific evidence avail- 
able is a sign of ignorance or stupidity, or both. 

Syphilis. This disease is caused by a spiral-shaped 
organism, the Spirochceta pallida. It produces a disease 
that may attack any part of the body structure. The 
course of the disease is divided into three stages: 

The first stage is marked by a characteristic sore or 
lesion, usually on the genitals. The second stage pre- 
sents a typical sore throat with characteristic patches, 
an eruption on the skin, and at times such disturbance 
of nutrition that the hair is lost in characteristic fashion. 
The third stage sets in anywhere from two to twenty 
years after the original infection with disturbances in 
the bones, joints, liver, heart, blood-vessels, and nervous 
system. 

In addition to the serious effects upon the individual 
himself the disease may be transmitted to offspring by 
prenatal infection, so that the succeeding generation 
may be syphilitic. 

In both male and female the disease may be cured 
in the early stage of the disease with thorough treatment 
by a reputable physician. For syphilis of the nervous 



HYGIENE OF THE SEXUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE 347 

system no satisfactory results have been secured in treat- 
ment. Locomotor ataxia may be checked in its develop- 
ment and a certain amount of muscular re-education 
accomplished, but, in the main, the results must be con- 
sidered as meager. 

Again, as in gonorrhea, we have a disease that is cap- 
able not only of destroying the health of the individual 
but also, and quite as important, wrecking his life and 
bringing strains and stresses upon family and friends 
that are unfair and unwarranted. 

There is a sort of justice to the dissolute when syphilis 
produces an aneurysm of the blood-vessels or causes 
his disablement or death by disease of the nervous system. 
He pays the price with his life. But here, as in all diseases 
contracted selfishly and without thought of and care 
for others, it is most unfair to family and friends to be a 
burden and care through the years of adult life because 
of selfish and uncontrolled desires in youth. 1 

Here, as elsewhere in life, the problem of living well is 
the problem of seeing straight, of not getting values 
mixed. The important matters in life relate not to 
wealth or to social position, not to culture or to voca- 
tion, but to the eternal truths of all time. To know the 
truth, to know thyself in whom the truth really lies 
here is the magic wand for health and happiness.

XIV. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES? 
XV. SUMMARY. 

The Emphasis of Hygiene. The time is past when 
one thinks of disease as necessary. For many persons 
it is a grim reality, a dread specter continually threatening 
and at times grasping its victims. But the point of 
view in this book maintains that much disease is un- 
necessary, that its occurrence represents failure of some 
person, or persons, to observe the laws of healthful living. 
Consequently, the emphasis for living finely and well 
is always to be placed upon the ways and means of attain- 
ing and maintaining health. 

The Universal Distribution of Disease. The emphasis 
on healthful processes should not shut us off from recog- 
nition of the fact of disease and the means of its pre- 
vention. Disease is a common phenomenon in all life. 
It varies with races, geographic location, climate, and 
mode of living. Complete eradication of disease, while 
not theoretically impossible, is not probable in the near 

348 



PREVENTION IN SPECIFIC DISEASES 349 

future. Men will need to accomplish great studies in 
sanitation, in hygiene, and in improvement of racial 
stocks through application of eugenic principles. At 
present man is subject not only to a variety of diseases 
that are present all the time with marked seasonal in- 
creases in certain months, but is attacked at times with 
epidemic diseases that cause great gaps in the population. 
At times, assuming a world-wide character, a disease 
may sweep in severe form over the entire habitable world, 
as recently occurred in influenza. Such a manifestation 
is called a pandemic. 

The studies made by scientific medicine in combating 
the prevalence and force of smallpox, bubonic plague, 
typhoid, syphilis, cholera, yellow fever, and malaria 
are tokens of promise that should hearten the race in 
its struggle for existence. 

Types of Disease. Commonly, we think of the trans- 
missible diseases when discussing the ills that affect 
the human body, but such view is incomplete and un- 
satisfactory. It is important to make clear the forms 
of disturbance which may arise in the body. They may 
be classified for our purposes into seven groups: 

1. The communicable diseases. 

2. The diseases of nutrition. 

3. The acute poisons. 

4. The chronic degenerative diseases. 

5. The functional nervous diseases. 

6. The local infections. 

7. Cancer and tumors. 

Causes of Disease. The cause of disease has been a 
momentous question from early times. Curious beliefs 
have arisen out of the efforts of man to determine the 
reason for loss of health. The early philosophers, the 
medicine man of savage tribes, the modern types of the 
unscientific and irrational give illustrations of super- 
stition, occultism, and frank ignorance at work on the 
problem. Whether it is "evil spirits" abiding in the 
person, or "subluxated vertebrae" pressing on nerves, 



350 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

or insufficient force of mind over matter, the cause 
seems to persist until attacked in laboratory and hos- 
pital with medical and surgical service. 
The causes of disease are as follows: 

1. Causes of communicable disease: 

(a) Bacteria which act by producing virulent poisons (toxins) 
destructive to the cells of the body. 

(6) Other organisms which as parasites act by producing 
poisons, by using up the blood of the host, and by ob- 
struction of vital and important pathways and organs. 

2. Causes of nutritional disease: 

(a) Absence of essential food elements, salts, or other matter 

from the diet. 
(6) Presence or absence of important secretions from the 

endocrine glands. 

3. Causes of acute poisoning: 

(a) Poisons developed in animal matter, such as milk, meat, 

and fish. 
(6) Poisons developed in improperly canned vegetables and 

fruits, 
(c) Poisons from certain metals, such as lead, mercury, and 

phosphorus. These poisons come usually from certain 

trades in which these metals are used. 

4. Causes of chronic degenerative disease: 

While heredity unquestionably plays an important part in 
these disorders, it is also true that improper living is chiefly 
the causative factor. Intemperate living as exemplified in 
mental or physical strain, mental or physical inactivity, too 
much or too little food or improper food. Certain cases are 
undoubtedly due to long-continued infections or the action 
of poisons over a period of years. Some cases seem to be 
associated with injuries and physical strains. 

5. Causes of functional disease: 

There is included in this category those diseases of bodily 
disturbance due to maladjustment of the individual to life 
and represented by the improper functioning of the mind and 
emotions. Not infrequently there is a sexual basis for these 
disturbances; always there is a strong psychic force at work. 
The increase hi this type of disease is to be expected so long 
as the standards of life remain what they are, and the social- 
economic strains continue without relief of a 'more whole- 
some and more scientific approach to the problems of human 

6. Causes of the local infections: 

Included in this group are the pyogenic infections due to 
entrance of streptococcus or staphyloooccus into the body. 1 

1 A local infection may become general, such- as occurs in septice- 
mia (blood-poisoning). Care for infections of this type is very im- 
portant so that general involvement of the body may not occur 



PREVENTION IN SPECIFIC DISEASES 351 

7. Cancer and tumors: 

Included here are the various forms of carcinomata, 
tumors, or other wild growths. 

The Transmission of Disease. Bacteria may be trans- 
mitted directly from one person to another, as in tuber- 
culosis, diphtheria, measles, whooping-cough, etc., or 
by means of agents, such as drinking-water, milk, food, 
soil, or objects, such as cups, handkerchiefs, toys, money, 
books, clothing, etc. 

Insects and vermin may carry the disease agent 
either directly as a host or indirectly through infection 
of food supplies. Malaria is the classic example of direct 
carrier, in which the mosquito acts as the host for the 
malarial parasite that reaches the blood-stream of man 
by means of the bite of the infected mosquito. Flies 
are notorious agents for transmitting disease by con- 
tamination of food. Rats are indirectly responsible 
for bubonic plague by harboring the rat flea in which 
occurs the complete cycle of the prganism causing the 
disease. 

It is important to note, therefore, that disease-produc- 
ing bacteria or parasites may be transmitted to man by 

1. Direct contact of the sick with the well, 

2. Infection of food and drink supplies, 

3. Contamination of articles used, or by 

4. Insects and vermin which harbor the germs of cer- 

tain diseases. 

The Prevention of Disease. The question of living 
finely, in the present state of society, frequently resolves 
itself into combating the prevalent agencies of disease 
transmission. Moreover, in addition, man must be awake 
to the dangers from improper food combinations, the 
hazards of acute poisoning, the menace of hereditary 
taint, the perils of degenerative disease, the attacks of 
pathogenic bacteria, and the deplorable functional dis- 
turbances. To face squarely the problems involved 
requires more courage than some can muster. These 
blunder along through life, frequently escaping disaster 



352 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

through chance. Others when confronted with the 
facts develop an unwholesome fear and proceed at once 
to a procedure in hygiene and sanitation that marks 
them as "freaks" or neurotics, according to the motive 
behind their program. Somewhere between these two 
extremes lies that golden mean that calculates life's 
hazards as the athlete measures the height of the obstacle 
to be surmounted. It all is part of the great game. 
The fact that the normal habitat of tetanus is the intesti- 
nal tract of herbivora, 1 and that, therefore, the bacillus 
is found most frequently in stable yards, will not mean 
that horses and barns will be shunned, nor that puncture 
of the foot by a nail in a board in the barnyard will be 
ignored. The rational life will recognize the facts of life 
and life processes; the courageous life will meet and face 
the facts. Prevention of disease will be considered by 
those who live fully, as an important means for rendering 
service. To avoid colds, to evade pneumonia, to escape 
Blights' disease are pathways not to Nirvana, but to 
that condition of physical superiority that is justified 
only by service and finds its fullest and best satisfaction 
in worth-while work. 

The prevention of disease resolves itself into what 
might be called general and specific means. 

General Means of Prevention. Resistance: It is a 
common observation that some persons when exposed 
to disease contract and develop the infection, while 
others do not. This freedom from disease by one exposed 
to it illustrates what science understands by the term 
"resistance." Resistance to disease may be racial, e. g. y 
the Jew and tuberculosis, and at times it seems to be an 
individual matter entirely. Resistance to disease in 
general may be developed. Healthful conditions of the 
body tissues and fluids renders the protective mechanism 
of the body more effective in its safe-guarding activities. 

1 Park found tetanus bacilli in the excreta of about 15 per cent, of 
horses and calves in the vicinity of New York City. They are 
present in other herbivora to a less extent. 



PREVENTION IN SPECIFIC DISEASES 353 

Resistance is developed through proper habits of living 
and is a result of correct adjustments of the body to the 
life of the environment. 1 Resistance and health are in 
one sense synonymous. Both flow from hygienic living. 
Resistance may not always protect from disease be- 
cause at times an organism will be so virulent that the 
protective forces of the body are broken through. It 
represents, however, the first line of defense in all war 
on disease. 

Disinfection, 2 isolation, and quarantine: Disinfection 
is an effort to destroy the attacking disease agent; iso- 
lation and quarantine aim to confine and control the 
patient while there is a possibility of transmitting living 
organisms. 

Knowledge of the life history of various disease-produc- 
ing organisms has made possible a more intelligent, and, 
therefore, a more effective attack on the problems pre- 
sented by communicable disease. Isolation and quaran- 
tine have grown in importance; disinfection has, perhaps, 
diminished. 

Special Means of Prevention. Artificial resistance: 
That some persons possess a high degree of resistance 
to disease is well known. This non-susceptibility has 
been called immunity. It is also known that immunity 
may be conferred artificially, and so there has developed, 
markedly in recent years, definite procedure in serum 
and vaccine prophylaxis to prevent disease by giving the 
individual an artificial resistance or artificial immunity. 
Notable achievements in this direction have been vacci- 

1 It is generally believed that fatigue lowers resistance to disease. 
People speak of "catching cold" because "they got tired out." 
There seems to be some evidence from experience for this general 
belief. On the contrary, Oppenheimer and Spaeth found in experi- 
menting with white rats that fatigue increases resistance to the 
toxins of both tetanus and pneumococcus (Type I). While this work 
(Oppenheimer, E. H., and Spaeth, R. A., American Journal of 
Hygiene, January, 1922, p. 51) does not discredit entirely the 
popular belief, it suggests at least the necessity for more scientific 
study of the factors influencing living, particularly human living.

nation for smallpox, inoculation for typhoid, and anti- 
toxin and toxin-antitoxin 1 for diphtheria. 

Avoidance of the cause of disease : In the final analysis, 
disease prevention rests largely upon the avoidance of 
the causative agent of disease. It is, therefore, important 
to describe the prophylaxis of the diseases of the six 
groups named, with appropriate emphasis upon the more 
significant examples. 

Prevention of Communicable Disease 2 : 

1. Typhoid fever. 

(a) Cause of the Disease. Typhoid bacillus. The bacillus is 
spread chiefly in the water and milk supply. Contamina- 
tion of wells, springs, and even municipal reservoirs by 
sewage containing typhoid bacilli does occur. The milk 
supply is infected by means of polluted water used in wash- 
ing the utensils or by unclean hands of the milker. Butter, 
ice, oysters, lettuce, and cabbage are known to have trans- 
mitted the disease. Flies may carry the organism by feed- 
ing on the excreta of typhoid patients and then contam- 
inating exposed food by walking on it. Typhoid "carriers" 
employed in the preparation or handling of food may 
transmit the disease. Food, fingers, and flies represent an 
alliterative triumvirate of immense importance in causa- 
tion. 

(6) Prevention. 

1. Protection of individual and community water supplies 

by proper disposal of excreta, by appropriate 
location of privies, and by protection of the water- 
shed of reservoirs. 

2. If gathered in an insanitary way pasteurization of all 

milk used for drinking purposes and for making 
of dairy products. Education and supervision of 
dairy men and milk distributors in the proper way 
of gathering and handling milk. 

3. Careful washing in water of certain foods eaten raw. 

4. Examination and supervision by health authorities 

of typhoid "carriers." 

5. Proper construction of privies so as to be fly-proof 

and water-tight. 

6. Adequate and sanitary care of the discharges and 

clothing of typhoid patient. 

7. Vaccination with the typhoid vaccine. 



'Toxin-antitoxin is given to individuals who are susceptible to 
diphtheria, as shown by the Schick test. 

2 Tuberculosis has been discussed in Chapter VIII. and the venereal 
diseases in Chapter XII. 



PREVENTION IN SPECIFIC DISEASES 355 

2. Typhus fever. 

(a) Cause of the Disease. An organism (as yet not com- 
pletely identified) that is transmitted by the body louse. 
The seriousness of this disease in central Europe during 
the World War directed the attention of all persons to the 
underlying insanitary conditions as important factors. Un- 
cleanliness, lack of bathing facilities, overcrowding, inade- 
quate food and clothing are conditions favoring the growth 
of the body louse. 

(6) Prevention. 

1. Fumigation or disinfection of clothing, living and 

sleeping quarters of those with the disease. 

2. Fumigation and disinfection of all persons likely to 

harbor the louse, such as soldiers and refugees. 

3. Isolation and quarantine separately of all those 

suffering from the disease and those suspected or 
exposed to the disease. 

3. Relapsing fever. 

(a) Cause of the Disease. Spirillum obermeieri. This or- 
ganism is transmitted by bedbugs, fleas, biting flies, and 
lice. 

(6) Prevention. 

1. Cleanliness in the home. Destruction of the vermin 

by means of thorough cleaning of all crevices in 
woodwork and furniture with corrosive sublimate 
or kerosene and fumigation with sulphur. 

2. Isolation of the patient. 

3. Disinfection of all clothing worn by patient, also the 

bed clothing. 

4. Smallpox (variola). 

(a) Cause of the disease is unknown. An organism has never 
been isolated, but the virus is supposed to be transmitted 
by the secretions of the eye, nose, mouth, and skin. 

(6) Prevention. 

1. Vaccination is of first and major importance. The 

value and importance of vaccination may be in- 
dicated by the fact that systematic vaccination in 
the six provinces near Manila, P. I., of a population 
of over a million, with a death-rate from small- 
pox exceeding 6000, has resulted in no deaths from 
smallpox in the vaccinated. Vaccination protects 
and should be rigidly required of all persons. (See 
Chapter V.) 

2. Isolation of the patient. 

3. Disinfection of the patient, room, and furniture after 

the disease. 

5. Chicken-pox (varicella). 

(a) Cause of the disease is unknown. Chapin 1 has shown that 
the disease is transferred even when the patient is in a

(6) Prevention. 

The disease is readily transmissible. It can only be 
prevented from spreading by strict isolation. 

6. Scarlet fever. 

(a) Cause of the disease is unknown. A streptococcus has 
been found in the blood of patients dying from the disease 
and it is often found in the mouth, but it has not been 
demonstrated 1 as the cause of the disease. The seasonal 
prevalence is shown in Fig. 34. 

(6) Prevention. 

The disease is readily transmissible. It can only be 
prevented from spreading by isolation. All dishes used by 
patient should be sterilized; all waste matter and uneaten 
food burned. Thorough cleaning of the room after use by 
the patient to be done with hot water and soap and bi- 
chlorid 1 : 2000. Room should be aired and sunned for 
two weeks after termination of the case. 

7. Measles (morbilli). 

(a) Cause of the disease is unknown. The mortality from 
measles in Massachusetts is shown in Fig. 35. 

(6) Prevention. 

Isolation of the patient is alone effective. Disinfection 
after the disease is over is useless. This view is held by 
the majority of health officers and epidemiologists. The 
disease is transmitted by mild cases, carriers, early cases, 
and convalescents. The same may be said for whooping- 
cough, influenza, pneumonia, and cerebrospinal meningitis. 
Chapin 2 gives the evidence upon which these statements 
are based. 

8. Mumps (epidemic parotitis). 

(a) Cause of the disease is unknown. 
(6) Prevention. 

Isolation of the patient is alone effective. See Measles. 

9. Whooping-cough (pertussis). 

(a) Cause of the disease is the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou. 

The disease is more prevalent in the late spring. See Fig. 

36. 
(6) Prevention. 

1. Vaccine treatment is effective in a large percentage of 

the cases. 

2. To prevent its spread, isolation is alone effective. 
*The demonstration of the cause of disease must meet rigid re- 
quirements. The germ theory of disease as given by Koch provides 

1. The isolation and identification of a specific organism in the 

tissues or fluids of the body affected. 

2. The production of the same disease in another body by in- 

J ection of the organism secured from the first. 
6. Ihe recovery of the organism from the second body with its 

isolation and identification with the organism as taken from 

the first body.

10. Influenza. 

(a) Cause of the Disease. The influenza bacillus has been 
given as the cause. The recent epidemic (1918) raised some 
doubts. At the present time this question cannot be called 
settled. 

(b) Prevention. .,_.,. 

1. Vaccine treatment has been helpful in some cases. 

Not yet established as a sure method. 

2. The control of the spread of influenza is a matter for 

public health officers primarily. It spreads along 
lines of communication. Doubtless many persons 
are carriers. Individual prophylaxis relates to keep- 
ing up the resistance and avoiding crowds. Contrary 
to a very common belief, there is no scientific evi- 
dence that whisky prevents the disease. 

11. Cerebrospinal meningitis. 

(a) Cause of the disease is the Diplococcus intracellularis. 
(6) Prevention. 

The disease is spread by earners. Disinfection is futile 

to stop the spread of the disease. The patient should be 

isolated. 

12. Pneumonia. 1 

(a) Cause of the disease is the pneumococcus in Type I, II, 
and III. Type IV is caused by a mixed strain in which are 
streptococci and pneumococci. 

(6) Prevention. 

The pneumococcus is present hi the mouths of from 40 
to 50 per cent. 2 of well persons. It has greater virulence in 
the winter. Prevention of the disease relates to keeping 
the mouth clean by brushing and cleaning of teeth and 
tongue and by keeping objects and hands out of the mouth 
and avoiding exposure to cold and wet. In particular 
avoid chilling the body. An effective serum is available for 
treatment of Type I pneumonia. 

13. Diphtheria. 

(a) Cause of the disease is the Klebs-Loffler bacillus. See 
Fig. 37, and note the age susceptibility in diphtheria, the 
pre-antitoxin and antitoxin periods, and the effect of early 
administration of antitoxin. 

(6) Prevention. 

1. Isolation of patient and avoidance of contact with the 

case. 

2. Use of Schick test to determine susceptibility. 

3. Giving of toxin-antitoxin to those susceptible to the 

Schick test. 

4. Giving of a prophylactic dose of antitoxin to those 

exposed to the disease. 

5. Be on guard against it, especially in the winter and 

spring. See Fig. 38.

14. Rheumatic fever. 

(a) Cause of the disease is unknown. Probably a streptococcus 
is the factor. Whatever the organism is, "in four-fifths of 
the cases of rheumatic fever tonsillitis precedes or accom- 
panies the disease." 1 

(6) Prevention (see Chapter XIV). 

1. Removal of diseased tonsils and adenoids. 

2. Proper treatment of abscess, decayed teeth, and in- 

flamed gums. 

3. Proper treatment of foci of infection in nose or 

sinuses. 

4. Avoidance of chilling the body. 

15. Malaria. 

(a) Cause of the disease is the Plasmodium malaria. 

(6) Prevention. 

1. Destruction of the Anopheles mosquitoes by draining 
their breeding places, and by destruction of larvae 
by covering with oil swamps that cannot be drained. 
The effect of adequate sanitary measures in the

Fig. 39. After adequate sanitary measures by General Gorgas in 
1908 the disease was controlled. (By courtesy of The Prudential 
Insurance Company of America.) 

Canal Zone from 1908 to 1917 is indicated in Fig. 
39. Figure 40 shows the geographic distribution of 
the disease in the United States and the reduction in 
malaria mortality in typical southern cities. 

2. Prevention of entrance of the parasite into the 

human body requires precaution against being 
bitten by the Anopheles. Screening of living 
quarters with a screen of 2.5 mm. mesh, and stay- 
ing indoors after sunset. 

3. In malarial districts, the use of prophylactic doses of 

quinin has been helpful. 

4. Prevention of infection of the mosquito requires pro- 

tection of malarial patients from the Anopheles. 
If the Anopheles bites a person sick with malaria 
and sucks out blood containing the malarial parasite 
the mosquito becomes infected. After an interval

the parasite completes a cycle of development in 
its host. If the mosquito now bites a well person 
it will produce the disease by conveying some of the 
parasites through the salivay secretion in the 
proboscis of the mosquito.

16. Anthrax. 

(a) Cause of the disease is the Bacillus anthracis. 

(6) Prevention. 

The disease is transmitted through herbivora, especially 
sheep and cows. The hides, wool, secretions, excretions, 
and blood of infected animals may give the disease to man 
through any abrasions of the exposed skin or by dust 
carried to the lungs. 1 Veterinarians, grooms, shepherds, 
drivers, butchers, and tanners are often exposed. They 
must be careful not to scratch themselves when at work 
with animals or their hides. The disease has been trans- 
mitted by shaving brush bristles, leather gloves, and other 
articles coming from animals. New shaving brushes 
should be boiled in water for at least three hours before 
using. 2 

Rosenau 3 says: "The prevention of anthrax is first and 
foremost a problem in animal husbandry which in this 
country comes under the purview of the Bureau of Animal 
Industry. Animals having anthrax should be killed and 
all anthrax carcasses should be buried, incinerated, or 
tanked in such a manner as to destroy the infection and 
prevent its dissemination. This is one of the reasons for 
international sanitary agreement, for the wool from 
Prussia, the hair and mohair from Asiatic Turkey, the 
horsehair from China, the bristles from Siberia, and the 
hides from India may carry the anthrax spores from 
these far-off lands and cause infection among our work- 
men." 

17. Hydrophobia (rabies). 

(a) Cause of the disease in man is a virus conveyed in the bite 

of some lower animal, usually the dog. 
(6) Prevention. 

1. The wound produced by [the bite of an animal 

supposed to be rabid should be cauterized with 
fuming nitric acid. This should be thoroughly 
done. 

2. If the dog dies of rabies, then the patient should have 

the Pasteur prophylactic treatment. 

3. Muzzling of all dogs if the disease appears in any 

community. 

18. Lockjaw (tetanus). 

(a) Cause of the disease is the Tetanus bacillus. 

1 Chapin, C. V.: Loc. cit., p. 286. 

2 There is no way of sterilizing shaving brushes without injury 
to the brush. If boiled for three hours many types of brushes 
would be severely damaged. In New York City shaving brushes 
cannot be sold unless the bristles have been sterilized before manu- 
facture by heating in an autoclave at high temperature for three or 
four hours. 

3 Rosenau, M. J.: Preventive Medicine and Hygiene, D. Appleton 
& Co., New York, 1913, p. 943. 



366 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

(b) Prevention. 

1. Thorough cleansing of all wounds. 

2. If wound contains garden earth, street dirt, or manure 

from herbivora the cleansing process should be 
most complete, even to enlargement of the wound 
to promote free bleeding. Wounds caused by blank 
cartridges and fireworks are especially dangerous. 

3. Use of tetanus antitoxin in suspected cases. 

19. Trichiniasis (trichinosis). 

(a) Cause of the disease is the Trichina spiralis. 
(6) Prevention. 

1. Careful inspection of pork by meat inspectors. 

2. Thorough cooking of all pork eaten. Uncooked pork 

should never be eaten. 

20. Hookworm disease (anchylostomiasis). 

(a) Cause of the disease is the hookworm, one species of which 
is zoologically known as the Anchylostoma duodenale; the 
form seen more often in America is the Necator americanus. 

(b) Prevention. 

The disease is transmitted through soil polluted by human 
excrement and the prevention amis directly therefore at: 

1. Preventing human pollution of the soil, and 

2. Medicinal treatment of cases to diminish the in- 

fection. 

Education in personal hygiene, habits of cleanliness, and 
sanitary disposal of the body excretions will eliminate the 
disease. 

21. Intestinal tapeworms. 

(a) Cause of the disease is any one of a number of cestodes. 
The Tcenia saginata of beef, Tcenia solium of pork, Both- 
riocephalus of fish may infect the body of man. 

(b) Prevention. 

1. Careful inspection by experts of meat at abattoirs. 

2. Thorough cooking of all meat. 

Prevention of Nutritional Disease : 

1. Rickets. 

(a) Cause of the Disease. Not fully determined as yet. The 
lack of calcium and phosphorous salts and vitamin A seem 
to be important etiologic factors. 

(6) Prevention. 

The easiest prevention in the light of the unknown factors 
is exposure to sunlight, 1 or the addition of cod-liver oil to 
the diet. The oil used should be as pure a product as 
possible. 

2. Scurvy (scorbutus). 

(a) Cause of the disease is the absence in the diet of vitamin C 

in sufficient quantities. 

1 Sunlight will cure the disease, as shown by Hess and McCollum.

PREVENTION IN SPECIFIC DISEASES 367 

(6) Prevention. 

Oranges, lemons, and canned tomato juice are efficient 
antiscorbutics. Raw fruits, vegetables, and salads will 
supply sufficient vitamin C if used regularly throughout the 
year. 

3. Pellagra. 

(a) Cause of the disease has not been definitely determined. 

There is believed to be a relation between the disease and a 

vegetable diet (restricted in kind of vegetables and without 

meat). 
(6) Prevention. 1 

Prevention seems possible along dietary lines alone. 

Addition of meat and variety in cereals and vegetables 

prevents the disease. 

4. Diabetes. 

(a) Cause of the disease is not known. There is often an 
hereditary predisposition. Associated in the production of 
the disease at times are disturbances in the nervous system, 
exophthalmic goiter, disease of the liver or pancreas. 

(6) Prevention. 

Individuals whose parents 2 have had diabetes should be 
exceedingly careful of exercise, diet, and general hygiene. 
Diet is most important. Restriction in quantity of food 
eaten and restriction especially of sugars are to be prac- 
tised. A semi-annual medical examination would be 
advisable. 

5. Gout. 

(a) Cause 3 of the disease is the accumulation in the body of 
excess purin bases derived from the nucleoproteins of 
food. See Chapter VII. 

(6) Prevention. 

1. Moderation in eating, avoidance of alcohol, tea, 

coffee, and cocoa. 

2. Elimination of meat and vegetables rich in nucleo- 

proteins. 

3. Outdoor exercise. Avoid sedentary life. 

6. Goiter. 

(a) Cause of the disease is not known. It has been attributed 
to the mineral content of drinking-water, to infection of the 
individual, to poor hygiene of life. 

(6) Prevention. 

Because the cause is so uncertain, the prevention cannot 
be sure. Removal from goitrous districts or boiling all 
drinking-water in goitrous areas would seem important.

7. Cretinism and myxedema. 

(a) Cause of the disease is the deficiency in thyroid secretion 
in the child (cretinism) or in the adult (myxedema). 

(6) Prevention. 

The development of the disease with our present informa- 
tion cannot be prevented. The giving of thyroid extract 
in cretinism will stop the progress of the disease and re- 
store the person practically to normal. The extract must 
be given for life. 

8. Obesity. 

(a) Cause of the Disease. In susceptible persons, eating too 

much food and lack of exercise. It is often hereditary. 
(6) Prevention. 

1. Exercise. 

2. Reduction of fats and carbohydrates in the diet. 

Prevention of Acute Poisoning. A distinction is to 
be made between food infections and food poisoning. 
A food infection is due to the growth of micro-organisms. 
Rosenau and Weiss 1 affirm that students of the subject 
of food infections "now believe that practically all in- 
stances ... are due to the bacillus of Gartner (B. 
enteritidis), which is taken as a type of a group of closely 
related organisms." Food infection is not common in 
America. There have been in recent years numerous 
cases of food poisoning. This disturbance is due to the 
product of the growth of bacterial life. The organism 
producing the toxin is the Bacillus botulinus. It may 
grow in meat, sausage, and vegetables. It has been 
found in improperly canned vegetables. Recently sev- 
eral deaths were caused by the eating of olives which 
had not been prepared properly, so that botulism devel- 
oped. An excellent extended discussion of food poison- 
ing is given by Rosenau, Preventive Medicine and 
Hygiene, pp. 538-570. 

The acute poisons from meats or canned vegetables 
are to be prevented by better inspection in food industries, 
and by care in the selection and use of food products. 

The poisons from lead and other metals can be avoided 
by protection of the worker in certain trades by means of 
masks and facial appliances, and by careful washing of 
the hands, especially painters, before eating. 

l Rosenau, M. J., and Weiss, P. D.: Food Infections, Journal of 
Amencan Medical Association, December 17, 1921, p. 1948. 



PREVENTION IN SPECIFIC DISEASES 369 

Prevention of Chronic Degenerative Disease. Chronic 
degenerative diseases are seen particularly in the heart, 
blood-vessels, kidneys, and nervous system. They repre- 
sent the deterioration in systems due to wear and tear, 
growing more pronounced with age, and the unusual 
degeneration due to poisons from unhygienic living, or 
chronic poisoning from metals or chronic pus infections. 

The prevention of such diseases lies in the observance 
of the rules given in Chapters IX and X, and avoidance 
of metallic poisons. 

Prevention of Functional Disease : 

1. Neurasthenia. 

(a) Cause of the disease is complex. Hereditary predisposition 
plays an important part. Upon hereditary weakness the 
stresses and strains of life at times bear too heavily. With 
such overload the individual frequently develops bodily 
complaints that have little or no organic basis. 

The common active causes of breakdowns are mental and 
physical overstrain, worry, sexual disorders, poisons, such 
as morphin, tobacco, or alcohol, and the poisons from 
typhoid, malaria, influenza, and syphilis. 

(6) Prevention. 

The prevention relates directly to the cause of the 
disease. Cabot has many helpful suggestions in his book, 
"What Men Live By." See also Paton's "Human Be- 
havior." 

2. Hysteria. 

(a) Cause of the disease is complex. Heredity is a most im- 
portant factor in its causation. Charcot held that every 
case was based on bad heredity. Exciting causes are mental 
or emotional shock, long-continued anxiety or care, worry, 
and mental strain. In some cases sexual worries or dis- 
turbances may induce the disease. 

(6) Prevention. 

On the basis of psychology prevention must be based on 
educational lines. 

1. Education must seek to inculcate habits of self-control. 

2. Whims and desires are to be gratified only on a rational 

basis of worth. 

3. Sympathy must not be too lavish. Trifling hurts and 

sorrows are not to be made the occasion for excessive 
sympathy. The treatment of girl children must be 
made similar to the treatment of boys in this re- 
spect. Self-reliance and self-control are as im- 
portant for girls as for boys. 1

Record, January, 1920.

4. Out-of-door activities with development of interests in 

sports, games, and friends must replace the day 
dreaming and romantic, erotic coloring of the usual 
social life of the girl at the beginning of adolescence. 

5. The hereditary factor is a eugenic problem. 

Prevention of the Local Infections: 

(a) Cause of the infections are a number of disease-producing 
organisms that enter through a break in the skin or mucous 
membranes. (See Chapter XIV for focal infections.) 
(6) Prevention. 

Prevention resolves itself into three factors: 

1. Keeping the general resistance as high as possible. 

2. Avoiding skin and mucous membrane injuries. 

3. Careful treatment of all wounds and injuries. (See 

Chapter XIV for focal infections.) 

Prevention of Cancer: 

(a) Cause is unknown. The increase in cancer, the parts most 
frequently attacked, and the age, sex, and race distribution 
are given in Fig. 41. 
(6) Prevention. 

Although the definite cause is not known, certain con- 
ditions are associated with cancer, and prevention has to do 
directly with these. 

1. The mouth and teeth should be kept in good condition. 

Teeth with rough edges should have dental care. 

2. Any local skin defect, such as ulcers, warts, moles, or 

tumors, should be removed at once if they show any 
irritation. 

3. Any unusual lump appearing in the breast should be 

examined by a physician. 

4. Any lumps or swellings in the soft parts of the body 

or pain or enlargement of bony parts should be 
carefully examined. 

5. After the change of life the appearance of the menses 

should be viewed with suspicion, and an early ex- 
amination by a gynecologist should determine the 
cause of the condition. 

6. Indigestion persisting over long periods may be re- 

garded as favorable for the development of cancer 
of the stomach. 

The preventive measures listed above relate to the 
avoidance of irritation and the early detection of the 
disease. Until the cause or causes are known prevention 
will be unscientific and not particularly effective. Bulkleyi

of meat. It has been suggested by some that bad per- 
sonal hygiene in general may be a cause. While recog- 



372 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

nizing the need for open-mindedness upon this point, it 
should be said that there is little evidence to support the 
dietary view. 

The recent survey by Janowitz 1 is commented on by 
the Journal of the American Medical Association 2 as 
follows: "In view of the reputed relation of cancer of 
the stomach to the character of the diet, and especially 
the vegetarian's belief that this disease is the result of 
meat eating, it is interesting to report that a careful 
study by Janowitz shows no evident alteration in either 
the number or the location of cancers of the digestive 
tract as observed in Berlin during the war, 3 when com- 
pared with a similar group of population before the war." 

What Are the Chances? Disease results in recovery 
or death. The recovery may leave the patient impaired 
for months, for years, or during life. The course of disease 
is fairly well known, and the following statement of 
prognosis should be helpful in estimating the seriousness 
of different diseases: 

1. Diseases from which recovery is possible: 

(a) Complete cure possible : 

1. Mild intoxications, such as food poisoning. 

2. Mild mechanical and chemical injury. 

(b) Complete cure probable: 

1. Chicken-pox (varicella). 

2. Dengue. 

3. German measles (rubella). 

(c) Recovery probable, but dependent upon patient and treat- 

ment: 

1. Measles. 

2. Erysipelas. 

3. Mumps. 

4. Early tuberculosis. 

In this group a complication may be fatal. 

(d) Recovery probable in the majority of cases: 

1. Serious infections, such as pneumonia, give a guarded 

prognosis. 

2. Trichinosis, scarlet fever, typhoid, yellow fever.

2. Diseases in which recovery from acute attack is probable, but some 

chronic injury is likely to remain: 

1. Endocarditis (heart disease). 

2. Infantile paralysis (poliomyelitis). 

3. Acute rheumatic fever. 

4. Nephritis. 

5. Arteriosclerosis. 

Nephritis may not and arteriosclerosis does not show 
an acute form. Injury to kidneys or arteries is usually 
permanent. 

3. Diseases in which recovery is rare: 

1. Hydrophobia. 

2. Tetanus. 

3. Sepsis. 

4. Anthrax. 

The mortality in this group is over 80 per cent, unless 
a special curative agent is used early. Hydrophobia and 
tetanus will show a good prognosis under early Pasteur 
treatment for the former and early antitetanus serum 
for the latter. 

4. Diseases in which recovery is not sure: 

1. Malaria. 

2. Secondary syphilis. 

3. Epidemic meningitis. 

4. Diabetes. 

5. Gout. 

6. Chronic tuberculosis. 

7. Tertiary syphilis. 

5. Diseases from which complete recovery is impossible: 

1. Purulent meningitis. 

2. Acute leukemia. 

3. Acute septic endocarditis (except the gonococcus 

form). 
Slowly fatal types are: 

4. Chronic leukemia. 

5. Addison's disease. 

6. Carcinomata (cancer) of internal organs (some ex- 

ceptions). 

7. Leprosy. 

8. Endocarditis (Streptoccocus viridans type). 

6. Diseases in which a functional cure may be secured by the surgeon: 

1. Renal calculus (stone in the kidneys). 

2. Cholelithiasis (gall-bladder disease). 

3. Internal suppurations. 

4. Malignant growth that has an early diagnosis and 

complete removal. 

The outcome of any disease is dependent upon the 
nature of the disease itself; upon such personal factors 
as age, habits, sex, race, heredity, and resistance; upon 
such environmental factors as economic strains, social 



374 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

surroundings, and sanitary standards; and upon the 
judgment and skill of physician and nurse. 

Summary. The causes of disease are bacterial, proto- 
zoan, and at times metazoan. In addition, poisons from 
food or drink, or imperfect metabolism of food in the 
body may produce disease. The maladjustments of the 
individual to life's problems may result in functional 
disturbances and failure of endocrine organs to function 
properly may bring on serious disorders. 

The carriers of disease of the communicable kind are 
either persons suffering in mild form from disease, such 
as colds, measles, etc., or "carriers" in whom the organism 
grows and develops without producing the symptoms 
of the disease. The "carrier" is well recognized in typhoid 
and diphtheria. In addition, objects may carry disease, 
although they are held now to be less dangerous than 
they were thought to be formerly. Nevertheless, in- 
fectious material on objects may be transmitted to well 
persons. Flies, rats, bedbugs, lice, fleas, cows, dogs, 
cats, and other animals may carry certain infectious 
agents to man. Typhoid, plague, typhus, tuberculosis, 
diphtheria, and many other serious diseases may be 
transmitted by means of insect or other animal carriers. 

The defenses against germ disease are the forces of 
resistance developed in the body naturally and the 
artificial immunities which may be conferred by vaccina- 
tion and serum treatment. In constant warfare against 
many transmissible disease agents are sunlight and air. 
Thus the environment offers forces of tremendous value 
to man in combating disease. Organized society has 
erected administrative defenses in the form of isolation 
and quarantine which are indeed helpful. 

To eliminate causes, to control "carriers," and to 
build up defenses are the three legs of the tripod Disease 
Prevention. To do this, hygiene in all its aspects is 
immensely valuable.

Septic Infections. The word "sepsis" means a general 
disease produced by pus-producing bacteria. Specific 
diseases such as typhoid and diphtheria are recognized 
as infections, but they are not classed as septic infections 
because the organisms are not pus producing. Typhoid 
bacilli select, as a rule, the small intestine for their develop- 
ment, and diphtheria bacilli choose usually the mucous 
membrane of the nose, pharynx, or larynx,

The organisms producing septic infections are of two 
types: streptococci and staphylococci. At times the 
pneumococcus is a factor and in certain tracts the colon 
bacillus is responsible for the trouble. These organisms 
may come from outside the body or they may come 
from the host where they have dwelled for some time 
without sign. The particular significance of this fact 
has only in recent years been fully appreciated. 

It has been observed that foci of infection in the body 
may serve as sources from which organisms may be 
spread to distant parts of the body. There is usually 
a definite relation between the portal of entry and the 
lesion or diseased process that develops. This relation- 
ship is not established for all cases, but it is so definite 
in many instances that foci are always under suspicion 
when infection develops systemically in the body. 

Portals of Entry. The gates by which pus-producing 
organisms enter the body are several. The skin affords 
a large field. Boils and skin infections following cuts, 
abrasions, or other injuries may develop into general 
septic conditions. Certain disturbances in the gall- 
bladder come from the extension of colon bacilli normally 
present in the intestinal canal, and these organisms may 
also invade the urinary tract, attacking the kidney, 
ureters, and bladder. While these forms exist and cause 
serious disturbance at times, the chief portal of entry 
is in the head and face. Teeth, tonsils, nose, and sinuses 
are common pathways for organisms. To understand 
the liability of these structures as foci of infection and 
the preventive measures to be applied is very important. 
They will be discussed in the order given above. 

Teeth. The temporary teeth of the child are lost 
in the second dentition, and are replaced by a permanent 
set. Belief that the temporary teeth are unimportant 
is unfounded in fact. 1 Their care is significant for the 
following reasons: Proper development and care of the 

l Snyder, J. R. : The Temporary Teeth, Journal American Medical 
Association, August 14, 1920, pp. 458-460. 



HYGIENE OF THE MOUTH, EYE, AND EAR 377 

temporary set determine the shape and size of the upper 
and lower jaw bones; they condition the maturing of 
the permanent set, for if the temporary teeth are lost 
too early, the permanent teeth do not have the proper 
stimulus for growth; and finally, good oral hygiene is as 
important for the health of the child as it is for the health 
of the adult. 

The importance of oral hygiene for children has been 
demonstrated by Fones in Bridgeport, where a five-year 
program of oral hygiene in the schools reduced the educa- 
tional budget spent on re-education from 40 to 17 per cent. 

The Cause of Dental Defects. The quality of tooth 
substance is determined in part before the child is born. 
The developing embryo must get the tooth-forming 
salts from the blood of the mother. Frequently the 
mother 'gives up needed and essential salts of her own 
body to the developing child because of insufficient 
content in her diet. It is extremely important, therefore, 
for the pregnant mother to select articles of diet from 
food with a high calcium content (see page 174). 

After birth the importance of dietary factors is not to 
be forgotten. Too often oral hygiene is viewed too 
narrowly as a tooth-brush affair merely. Dental deteriora- 
tion is due to what is omitted from the diet rather than 
to what the diet contains. Attributing to candy or soft 
foods the cause of dental decay is not well supported. 
For example, the Rhodesian skull 1 shows "unmistakable 
evidence of dental caries, and even of abscesses at the 
roots of the teeth." 2 Dental decay is not a modern dis- 
ease apparently, but one experienced by our earliest an- 
cestors. 3 While the evidence is not complete, it would 
appear that the tooth-brush, candy, and soft foods were 
unknown to primitive man, but that deficient dietary 
factors could play then the role that they are playing 
so surely today. For other good reasons the tooth-

brush should be used regularly and well, candy should 
not be eaten between meals, and coarse food requiring 
mastication should be selected. But reliance on such 
procedures for development of good teeth is precarious. 
Adequate diet is extremely important. 1 

Teeth as Foci of Infections. There is abundant evidence 
to show a causal relationship between infected teeth 
and many varied forms of general bodily disturbance. 
At times extreme claims are made and tooth extraction 
is expected to accomplish too much in health restoration. 
Reaction against overzealousness on the part of the 
inexperienced should not lose sight of the real facts. 
Evidence by both foreign and home clinicians is avail- 
able. Antonius and Czepa, 2 following a systematic use of 
the x-ray in Falta's service, found that 66 per cent, of 
225 cases of various diseases had some infectious process 
at the root of one or more teeth. Their observations 
led them to affirm a causal relationship between focal 
infections in the teeth and nephritis, chronic septic endo- 
carditis, joint and muscular rheumatism, neuralgia, and 
other disturbances. 

The Life Extension Institute, Inc., reports that "in a 
recent series of 200 x-rays at the head office of the Institute, 
67.5 per cent, were found with infected roots or gums. 
Among 200 individuals there were 205 foci of infection 
found." Lambert 3 reports that in 1000 cases of rheu- 
matism at Bellevue Hospital, 68 per cent, showed bad 
teeth, and that since the establishment of the dental 
clinic in Bellevue "the number of rheumatics has de- 
creased enormously." 

The story of dental infection is most interesting. At 
times the relationship seems clear enough because of

alveolar abscess, marked inflammation, and frank evi- 
dence of decay. Quite often, however, the astounding 
x-ray shows the trouble to be in the root canal or at the 
tip of the tooth in the jaw, while quite disturbing to 
the layman is the fact that there may be no signs to the 
owner that anything is wrong with the teeth. Such 
cases are only revealed by the x-ray examination. 

Because of experience, modern dentistry views with 
suspicion crowns and bridge work, and especially if 
these were mounted some years ago before the practice 
of root canal fillings. It is not an extreme position that 
the dentist takes when he advises, after an x-ray diag- 
nosis, that expensive crowns be removed or even that 
teeth be pulled for the purpose of eliminating sources of 
infection. 

Fortunately, there is developing rapidly among den- 
tists a technic for filling root canals in instances when 
the nerve has been killed. This technic involves use of 
the x-ray to determine whether or not the filling has 
reached the tip of the tooth. With extension of this 
procedure among dentists, and with understanding by 
laymen of its necessity, certain forms of general bodily 
disturbance and ill health will be prevented. 

Pyorrhea Alveolaris. Pyorrhea alveolaris 1 is an infec- 
tion of the gums with characteristic changes in the bony 
alveolar process that holds the tooth. It begins at the 
gum margins and extends, causing marked inflammation. 
A common picture in well-developed pyorrhea shows 
the gums retracted so that the teeth appear abnormally 
long; the gums are red and bleed easily; and around 
their margin a yellowish pus exudes. A disagreeable 
taste in the mouth, foul breath, and disturbances of 
digestion are common results. More serious are general 
systemic infection of other parts due to invasion by pus 
organisms of the lymph and blood-channels. 

The cause of pyorrhea has been assigned to an animal

parasite, the Endameba buccalis. The case is not clear 
against this particular organism, but the preventive 
and treatment methods are well known. A mouth- 
wash of 2 drops of the fluidextract of ipecac to J glass 
of water is helpful in the early stages. If the condition 
is well developed thorough dental prophylaxis is impera- 
tive. 

How to Keep the Mouth and Teeth Clean. There is 
considerable conflicting testimony regarding the efficacy 
of different methods of oral hygiene. Competent dentists 
are in essential agreement with the following procedures: 

1. Brush the teeth daily, preferably after each meal. Use a 

rather stiff brush with uneven bristles and thoroughly 
cleanse all surfaces of the teeth. A rotary, across, and up- 
and-down motion are the proper movements to make. Never 
neglect the night brushing. This is the most important 
single brushing. 

2. One should have three tooth-brushes, to be used alternately, 

This will give tune for the bristles to thoroughly dry out. 

3. Use a paste or powder that is not scratchy. 

4. Food particles caught between teeth should be removed with 

dental floss. Care should be taken not to injure the gums. 

5. An alkaline mouth-wash is useful before retiring, although not 

essential if the mouth is in good condition. Lime-water made 
from coarse unslaked lime may be used. 

6. Cleansing of the tongue with a tooth-brush used only for this 

purpose assists in the removal of decomposing material that 
at times causes foulness of breath. 

7. Examination of the teeth by a good dentist every six months, 

preferably every three months, is strongly advised. Atten- 
tion to this matter will prevent many defects from occurring. 
If evidence of dental defect develops, immediate attention 
should be given to it. 

Tonsils as Foci of Infections. The tonsils are lymphatic 
glands situated at the entrance to the throat, or pharynx. 
They lie in pockets or depressions between two bands 
of musculomembranous tissue called the pillars of the 
fauces. They serve, like all lymphatic tissue in the body, 
to protect against bacteria, 1 and because of their situation 
they are liable to become infected.

The evidence against the tonsils as foci of infection 
is very strong. Heart disease, rheumatic fever, and 
chorea have shown certain relationship. St. Lawrence 1 
reports a study of 94 cases, and shows the effect of re- 
moval of the tonsils upon the recurrence of general 
disease (Fig. 42). After tonsillectomy the occurrence 
of rheumatic manifestations dropped from 85 per cent. 
to slightly over 30 per cent. This careful work shows 
that the tonsils are the most important single portal 
of entry for rheumatic infections, and that their removal 
greatly decreases the liability of recurrences.

Belief that removal of the tonsils causes injury to the 
voice, ears, or interference with the protective mechanism 
of the body is not well founded. The voice is usually 
improved after tonsillectomy, particularly if the tonsils 
are large. Only the amateur in surgery would damage 
the neighboring throat structures in the operation. 
In the second week after the operation pain in the ears

may be quite marked, but this is temporary and of no 
vital significance. The protection to the body is unim- 
paired because the deeper lymphatic nodes take over the 
work formerly performed by the tonsils. Their pro- 
tected position hi the deeper tissues prevents exposure 
to the great number of bacteria constantly present in 
the mouth. 

Finally, it should be remembered, that removal of the 
tonsils, especially in children and young adults, results 
hi most salutary effect upon the general health. In 
particular cases, colds, croup, and tonsillitis are greatly 
decreased both in severity and frequency. In children, 
an increase in weight is commonly noted, and favorable 
effects on the nervous system are most striking. In 
children the adenoids are usually removed at the time 
of the tonsillectomy (see page 226 for Adenoids). 

The Nose and Sinuses as Foci of Infections. Four 
bones of the skull contain distinct cavities which give 
rise, at times, to local or even general disturbance. 
These cavities are called sinuses, and all open into the 
nose or nasopharynx. The frontal sinus is located in 
the frontal bone immediately above the eyebrows; the 
ethmoidal sinus is a series of small cavities in the ethmoidal 
cells which open into the upper part of the nasal cavity; 
the superior maxillary sinus is a large cavity in the upper 
jaw bone on either side of the nose, and the sphenoidal 
sinus is a small cavity in the body of the sphenoid bone. 
This opens into the nasopharynx. These sinuses are 
lined with mucous membrane. During an acute cold, 
"influenza, pneumonia, scarlet fever, measles, diphtheria, 
typhoid fever, and other infective diseases" 1 infection 
and inflammation may develop hi these cavities. De- 
formities in the nose which prevent free drainage of the 
sinuses or an infected tooth hi the upper jaw opening 
into the sinus of the superior maxillary bone, are not 
uncommon ways in which trouble begins. Understand-

ing of such processes should be helpful in seeing the 
futility of the punching or manipulating of the spine 
for "subluxations." 

Acute inflammation in these centers may require, 
and often do demand, surgical attention. If not cared 
for properly, extension to the brain may occur, with fatal 
consequences. The sinuses do not play the same kind 
of a role as the teeth and tonsils apparently, and yet at 
times a chronic sinusities is found to be the cause of 
general disturbance in health. 

Mouth-washes, Sprays, and Gargles. Liquids are 
used for cleansing the mouth cavity during an infection. 
During an attack of tonsillitis or pharyngitis local 
treatment is very helpful. The chief value lies in the 
mechanical washing of the inflamed part, and slight 
reliance should be placed upon drugs or chemicals unless 
prescribed by a physician. 1 The reason for insisting upon 
medical direction is the variable conditions that may 
be found. Shall an antiseptic only be used, an irritant, 
or an astringent? What preparation is selected depends 
upon the condition of the mucous membrane. A mouth- 
wash of salt water, or bicarbonate of soda hi water, 
is beneficial for removing mucus, but the claims of spe- 
cial curative values for advertised gargles and mouth- 
washes are grossly exaggerated, to say the least. 

Chronic conditions in the nose or throat may require 
sprays, gargles, or drops over a long period of time. The 
rational procedure is to secure from a specialist a pre- 
scription for the condition, and then follow his directions. 

. HYGIENE OF THE EYE 

The Eyes Need Care. The eyes of man developed 
to perform a function that has been greatly changed 
in modern civilization. The invention of Gutenberg 
has thrown enormous strain upon the eye by requiring

384 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

it, in reading the printed page, to make many more move- 
ments than are ever called for in the environment of 
large objects. Many eyes are unable to make this adjust- 
ment. About 35 per cent, of the school teachers in 
Germany wear glasses, though not more than 15 to 20 
per cent, in the United States. This difference Terman 1 
suggests to be due to the "unwillingness of our women 
teachers to risk the disfigurement of spectacles." There 
are many women who refuse to wear glasses because 
of pride, but this attitude is probably not the explanation 
for the condition found in this country. More people 
in all walks of life need and wear glasses in Germany 
than in America, because as a people the Germans are 
inclined to myopia and in America myopia is less frequent. 

The use of eyeglasses and spectacles is recommended 
to correct abnormalities of eye structure or eye function. 
Myopia (near sight), hyperopia (far sight), presbyopia 2 
(far-sight condition of advancing age), astigmatism (un- 
equal curvature of the cornea f ront part of the eye) 
are structural defects to be corrected by proper lenses 
placed in front of the eye. Weakness or insufficiency 
of the external muscles of the eyeball may be functional 
and disappear if strain is removed by proper lenses. 

How to Care for the Eyes. -Intelligent care of the eyes 
will provide: 

Early and repeated eye examinations. Such examina- 
tions should be made if the individual has headaches, 
or, if in reading, the book is held nearer than 12 inches. 

Examinations should be conducted preferably by oculists 
rather than by opticians or optometrists. The oculist 
is a physician who examines the eye with reference to 
other conditions prevailing in the body. He does not 

1 Terman, L. M.: The Teacher's Health, Houghton Mifflin & Co., 

2 Presbyopia is a very interesting condition. The near point of 
vision begins to recede at about the age of ten and continues through- 
out life. At about forty-five it has reached 12 inches, which is our 
distance for reading and many kinds of work, so that glasses are 
needed to bring back the near point to the working distance. C 1

HYGIENE OF THE MOUTH, EYE, AND EAR 385 

merely refract the eye. The optician or optometrist in 
small towns is usually engaged in the jewelry business 
and conducts eye examinations free for the purpose of sell- 
ing lenses and frames. He may examine quite accurately 
the optical defect of the eye, but he is not in a position 
to interpret the eye condition in terms of general disease. 
Thus, kidney disease with its eye signs, arteriosclerosis, 
sarcoma of the eye, and other serious conditions, would 
be detected by the skilled oculist and missed by the 
optician. The eye and forehead ache of malarial fever, 
the characteristic pupil conditions in early locomotor 
ataxia would be recognized by the physician oculist; 
the optician or optometrist would not be able to make 
a differential diagnosis. 

Avoidance of fine work, especially by children. The 
effort to see small relationships, as in sewing, embroidery, 
drawing, painting, reading, and so forth, is a strain on 
the eye muscles. Such work should not be continuous 
for long periods. 

Frequent rest for the eyes from study or close work. 
It will relieve the eyes to look up from close work and 
allow the eye to look into the distance. Objects 20 feet 
away are seen by the normal eye without any muscular 
effort. To look out of the window when doing close work 
indoors is a very desirable relief for the eye. 

Good light. Good light for seeing purposes is light 
from a steady source, as near like the sun as possible, 
coming from above or from the side. In all writing it is 
important that the light come from the left for right- 
handed persons or from the right for left-handed persons. 

Twilight is a poor light with which to do any fine 
work. For seeing purposes full sunlight may be unde- 
sirable because of too great intensity or glare. Reading 
on a moving train or street car is hard on the eyes because 
of the wavering source of light, the shadows cast, and the 
constant change in the focus and adjustment of the 
external muscles of the eyes required by the vibrating 
book or paper. 

25 



386 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

Good light will have the following characters: 

1. Steady source. 

2. Sufficient intensity to illumine without glare. 

3. No shadows produced on the reading or work surface. 
Tinted glasses. In caring for the eyes it will be helpful 

to have tinted glasses for use in the bright sun, especially 
at the seashore, and during the winter while the snow 
is on the ground. They should also be used in strong 
winds, as in automobiling, unless one is obliged to wear 
glasses for other purposes. 

Good general health. The eye responds quickly to 
lowered states of bodily efficiency. Good health means 
almost always right living, and the eyes will share in the 
general effects. 

The Cause of Eye Defect or Disturbance. The proper 
care of the eyes results uniformly in good eyes. Lack 
of proper care causes a variety of eye defects or dis- 
turbances. Viewed from this angle, of course, we find the 
following: 

1. General ill health, weakness or lowered vitality. 

The loss of tone in general is expressed in the eye 
in definite deterioration. 

2. Excessive use of the eye. Students, teachers, 

laboratory workers, and all sedentary workers 
engaged in close eye work are liable to overuse 
the eye. 

3. Poor light. 

4. Irritating forces, such as chemicals, vapors, dust, 

wind, and excessive heat. 

5. Disease of the eye, such as trachoma, pink eye, 

ulcer of the cornea, ophthalmia neonatorum, etc. 

6. Hereditary factor may be a cause of certain abnormal- 

ities. The generally accepted opinion is that at 
birth all eyes are hyperopic, and that as develop- 
ment progresses the eyes in time become the 
proper size and shape with the refracting media 
acting symmetrically. If the cornea and lens 
do not refract rays to a common focus then there 



EYE, AND EAR 387 

is astigmatism. If the eyeball does not enlarge 
to the proper size then there is hyperopia. If the 
eyeball tissues stretch or overdevelop then myopia 
is the result. Thus myopia is really acquired and 
hyperopia is congenital. 

Uncorrected eye defects and abnormalities cause a 
variety of disturbing conditions that range all the way 
from headache to marked general ill health. Use of a 
defective eye demands extreme effort on the accommo- 
dation powers of the eye. It always strains the eye 
and wastes energy. All children should have the relief 
and help that scientific oculists can give; all adults 
owe it to themselves to secure optimum working con- 
itions. 

The Use of Drops and Other Treatments. Drops are 
used in examination of the eye to paralyze the muscles 
of accommodation so that the actual defect in the eye- 
ball may be determined. Atropin or homatropin is 
used for this purpose. In the care of a skilled oculist 
there is no danger from the use of these drugs. Opticians, 
jewelers, non-medical "refractionists," and peddlers are 
prohibited by law from using "drops." This is most 
fortunate, because their use in cases of glaucoma pro- 
duces serious results. Persons with glaucoma (excessive 
pressure within the eyeball) suffer from failing vision, 
and are likely to be seeking for optical aid. The impor- 
tance of this law is, therefore, very great. 

Eye diseases and abnormalities offer a rich field for 
the charlatan and patent-medicine faker. Numerous 
cures or remedies are on the market claiming "to restore 
defective sight," "to make the eyes young again." As 
illustrative of this class of fraudulent preparations the 
following from Nostrums and Quackery 1 is given: 
"The label on Eyelin contained the statements: 
Repairs and Rejuvenates the Eye and Sight. 
Reshapes and Rejuvenates the Eye and Sight.

Analysis of the stuff in the government laboratory dis- 
closed the fact that it consisted essentially of vaselin, 
perfumed." 

One dollar a box for vaselin, perfumed, to correct 
eye defects represents the honesty and integrity of the 
whole patent-medicine game. Exorbitant prices for 
simple preparations that are often worthless for the 
condition described. 

Another preparation widely advertised is Murine. 
Before the advent of the Food and Drugs Act the carton 
in which this "eye water" was sold read as follows: 



Murine 

A positive cure 
for Sore Eyes, Red, Inflamed, and Itching Lids. 



Since that law has become operative, and a lying label 
has become illegal instead of merely immoral, the carton 
bears this legend: 



Murine 

a Reliable Relief 
for Sore Eyes, Red, Inflamed, and Itching Lids. 



On analysis, Murine is found to be a water solution 
of borax (12 grains to the fluidounce). The price charged 
for Murine is $1 per ounce; the estimated cost of the 
preparation is 5 cents per gallon. 

Common Disorders of the Eye. Disorders of the eye 
are frequently of minor importance, but because of the 
delicate structure of the eye and the value of perfect 
vision, intelligent care should be given to all abnormalities, 
however trivial. The disorders commonly found may 
be grouped in three headings: injuries, infections, and 
systemic causes. 

Injuries to the eye may result from a blow upon the 
face, resulting in the condition known as "black eye." 



HYGIENE OF THE MOUTH, EYE, AND EAR 389 

The blackness is due to the breaking of blood-vessels 
in the soft tissues around the eye with a flooding of blood 
into the tissues from the broken vessels. If care can be 
given immediately after the injury ice compresses will 
be most helpful. After discoloration has occurred hot 
compresses will be useful in promoting absorption of the 
extravasated exudate. Local medication is useless, and 
poultices, beefsteak, etc., are valuable only as they supply 
heat. A hot-water bag is more desirable from many 
standpoints than sirloin. 

Injury from a foreign body in the eye is very common. 
The usual cinder, eyelash, or dust-grain is not a serious 
disorder, but until removed it is extremely troublesome. 
To remove a foreign substance from the eye gently pull 
down on the lower lid and look in the lower sac for the 
irritation. If it is not seen, the upper lid must be everted 
for examination. To evert the upper lid grasp the edge 
of the lid with index-finger and thumb of right hand, 
pulling forward and downward. Ask the patient to 
look downward, and at the same time turn the lid up 
over the thumb of left hand placed on the margin of the 
eye socket with nail side forward. Wipe off the particle 
with the corner of a clean handkerchief or wisp of cotton. 
If the particle is embedded so that it is not easily removed, 
refer the case at once to a physician who can use sterile 
instruments. 

Infections of the eye occur more frequently in child- 
hood than in adult life. A common disorder is known 
as sty of the eye. A sty is an infection and inflammation 
of one of the glands along the margin of the eyelid. Its 
cause is not known. Some attribute eye-strain as a 
factor. Its prevalence in young children would suggest 
need for ocular examination. It may be caused by some 
other factor, such as infection due to rubbing the eye 
with dirty hands. Stys are not usually serious, but 
should be cared for carefully. When "ripe" they should 
be opened with a sterile needle, and the pus removed 
by gentle pressure with a bit of cotton on a toothpick.

After expulsion the wound should be painted with 5 per 
cent, argyrol and yellow oxid of mercury salve used in 

the eye. 

"Pink-eye" is an inflammation of the conjunctiva. 
There are two kinds: one seen in cases with cold hi the 
head, influenza, eye-strain, or after exposure to wind 
or irritating smoke. This type is due to local causes. 
The other is an infectious inflammation of the conjunctiva, 
a conjunctivitis, that is very communicable. The pink- 
eye from irritation should be treated by washing the 
eye with saturated solution of boric acid; the infectious 
conjunctivitis requires medical attention. 

Purulent conjunctivitis of the newborn is commonly 
due to gonococcus infection. Before the law requiring 
obstetricians and midwives to use silver nitrate hi the 
eyes of all infants at birth, this condition was a common 
cause of blindness. 

Trachoma is an exceedingly communicable disease 
of the eye characterized by granules in the conjunctiva 
of the lids. It is largely seen among children (especially 
those of foreign birth) of crowded sections in city schools. 
It may result in impairment or even total loss of vision. 
Granular conditions of the lids of a simple type are not 
to be confused with trachoma. All granular conditions 
of the eye should be examined by a physician. 

Systemic causes of eye disorders are the diseases that 
show certain eye changes. Thus, kidney and heart 
disease may be indicated by swelling and baggy forma- 
tions under the eye; locomotor ataxia shows characteristic 
pupillary changes, and various poisons indicate their 
effects in retinal changes. 

Blepharitis is an inflammation of the margins of the 
eyelids. If neglected the eyelashes fall out, not to be 
replaced. This makes an unsightly deformity. 

Chalazions are caused by infections of the ducts and 
glands along the inner side of the lids. They occur 
quite commonly. They may appear very much like a 
sty, and at first it is difficult to decide whether there is a

sty or chalazion forming. The latter is sometimes spoken 
of as a blind sty. 

HYGIENE OF THE EAR 

The Ear Needs Care. The ear is subjected in the 
modern world to a variety and intensity of sound waves 
out of all proportion to the forces acting when the hear- 
ing apparatus was evolved, but the adjustment necessary 
in modern life affects not so much the organ of hearing 
as it does the nervous system in general. Noise wastes 
human energy. Quiet and harmonious sounds are very 
beneficial. The ear carries to the nervous system all 
sounds; unfortunately for modern man it is not more 
selective. 

The ear itself is important, however, because it is 
frequently infected and because it offers a pathway for 
infection to the mastoid cavities, and even to the brain 
itself. In the upper part of the throat there opens the 
eustachian tube that leads from the middle part of the 
ear structure. Normally the tube serves to permit 
an equalization of air-pressure in the middle ear with 
that existing outside the body. Any good book on 
physiology will explain this structure and function. 
This middle part of the ear from which the eustachian 
tube leads has another passageway that connects with 
the cavities of the bony prominence felt behind the ear, 
i. e. t the mastoid. Infection carried into the middle 
ear by means of the eustachian tube may extend to 
the mastoid and thence to the brain, requiring surgical 
operation or resulting in death. 

How to Care for the Ear. Prevent so far as possible 
all infections of the nose and throat. In children especially 
this is to be interpreted to mean also prevention of the 
communicable diseases of childhood, namely, measles, 
whooping-cough, scarlet fever, and diphtheria. Measles, 
whooping-cough, and scarlet fever are not infrequently 
complicated by middle-ear disease which may result in 
deafness or even in death. 



392 PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED 

Remove adenoids in children. The adenoid tissue 
growing near the opening of the eustachian tube causes 
deafness of varying degrees by shutting off partially or 
completely this opening. 

Avoid diving in cold salt water. In all diving the pres- 
sure of the water may force infectious material up the 
eustachian tube. This has been noted to occur more 
frequently hi salt-water diving. Apparently this is due 
to the action of salt water hi clearing the mucus from 
the nose and throat and especially from the opening of 
the tube. Exposure to cold causes ear disturbance at 
times. 

Carefully remove excess wax in the ear canal. The 
wax that is secreted in the ear canal is a normal and 
useful product. At times it increases to excess and needs 
removal to restore hearing. One should never attempt 
to clean the wax out oneself. The use of hairpins and 
other hard objects should be avoided. The canal may 
be cleaned by careful syringing with warm water and 
wiping of its walls by means of a wooden applicator with 
cotton on its end. 

Refer to a physician all disturbances of the ear. At 
times foreign substances get into the ear canal. Insects 
may fly in or children may put into the ear objects, 
such as a pea, grain of corn, small toys, beads, etc. They 
need careful removal. 

Careful watch of the ear must be kept throughout a 
cold, an attack of croup, measles, whooping-cough, or 
scarlet fever in babies and children. Since they are 
usually unable to tell what hurts them, it is necessary 
to rely upon daily examination by the physician to avoid 
serious complications. 

Earache accompanying a cold, croup, sore throat, or 
communicable diseases is caused by infection carried 
into the middle ear. The practice of putting oil into the 
ear is traditional and unscientific. Heat in the form of a 
hot-water bag to the ear or gently syringing the ear with 
warm water will give relief. During all coughs, colds, etc., 



HYGIENE OF THE MOUTH, EYE, AND EAR 393 

occurring in children a nightcap will be found very help- 
ful in preventing an attack of earache. 

The Mastoid. Prevention of middle-ear disturbance 
by avoidance of the communicable diseases is important 
not only for the ears but also for the mastoid. Disease 
of the middle ear may extend to the mastoid, which com- 
municates with the ear. If not cared for properly and 
promptly a mastoid infection may result fatally.
