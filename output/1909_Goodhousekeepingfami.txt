Introduction 



^?rHIS volume, uniform in size and 
^l style with the Good Housekeeping 
^^ Everyday Cook Book, is an en- 
tirely new work from cover to cover, con- 
taining no material which is to be found 
in that very useful and successful book, 
which has taken its place as a household 
necessity throughout the United States; 
rather, supplementing that, the two em- 
bodying the cream of the cookery printed 
in the Good Housekeeping magazine in 
the past six years. 

Gopd Housekeeping recipes have in all 
instances the test of experience,, being 
accepted and printed only after their 
working value has been duly established 
by the originators or contributors. Fur- 
thermore, possible defects in the word- 
ing of a recipe are promptly reported by 
readers and corrected by the Editors in 
the preparation of the book; this, how- 
ever, being necessary in but few in- 
stances. 

Several distinctive features of the 
Good Housekeeping Family Cook Book 
are worthy of especial attention. The 
illustrations make clear the more elabo- 
rate methods, as pastry and croquette 
making. The range of subjects has been 
enlarged. In addition to those found 
in the Everyday Cook Book, chapters are 
devoted to chafing-dish cookery, candy- 
making and preserving. The process in 
each recipe is complete, simple and clear, 
furnishing a working basis to the inex- 
perienced. Logical grouping and an 
alphabetical index make the desired 
recipe instantly available. 

The memorandum feature which 
proved so popular in the Everyday Cook 
Book is retained in this, that favorite 
recipes from the pages of the magazine 
may be preserved from month to month. 
The Good Housekeeping Family Cook 
Book represents the latest, most thor- 
oughly tested and highly approved exper- 
ience of hundreds of the best profes- 
sional and home cooks throughout the 
American continent.

Methods and Recipes 



General Information 

The food problem is one of the most 
difficult that the housekeeper has to 
meet. Today it means a study of bal- 
anced rations and proportions, as well 
as the cost and nutritive value of foods. 
It means the varying of these propor- 
tions to suit the needs of the old, the 
young, the laborer and the brain worker. 
It means, moreover, the combining and 
cooking of these materials in such fash- 
ion as to make them not alone balanced 
and nutritious, but pleasing and pala- 
table as well. 

What makes a food 

All foods are made up of various pro- 
portions of five chemical compounds 
often called food principles. These are 
proteid, carbohydrates, fats, mineral 
matter and water. 

Proteid is a class name for a ' large 
number of allied compounds which have 
the definite work of both building tissue 
and furnishing energy to the body. 
Proteid is a peculiar, semi-liquid sub- 
stance, of a straw-color, which has the 
property of 'turning opaque white, and 
solidifying in hot water. A familiar il- 
lustration of one of the purest forms is 
the white of an egg. Its behavior with 
hot water is familiar to all. 

The carbohydrates include the starches 
and sugars, and their long name simply 
means that they are composed of just 
three simple materials or elements — 
carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. There 
are many starches, but each kind is 
made up of an insoluble white grain 
inclosed in a very thin envelope of wood 
fiber. When this grain is cooked in 
boiling hot water the envelope softens,, 
swells, and breaks, expelling the granular 
starch, which becomes transparent and 
soluble in the hot liquid. It is for this 
reason that starch should alwp.ys be 
thoroughly cooked. Both starches and 
sugars are sources of energy. Pats or 
oils furnish heat and energy. 

There is no more important food nu- 
trient than water. This is a chemical 
compound containing only the two ele- 
ments, hydrogen and oxygen. The fact 
that about three-fourths of the body, 
v^eight is due to water makes its im- 



GENERAL INFORMATION 31 

portance in the diet at once apparent, 
Few people drink enough. It is a con- 
servative estimate that at least a quart 
a day should be taken as a beverage. 

The uses of the mineral salts are also 
many. They are found in all the digest- 
ive fluids of the body and without their 
presence absorption could not take place, 

For each of the familiar combina- 
tions of foods there is a scientific explan- 
ation. The practice of baking pork 
with beans undoubtedly rose from the 
unconscious desire to balance the ration. 
The beans rich in carbohydrates and 
proteids lacked fat which the pork sup- 
plied. The corn bread, bacon and peas 
in the same way furnish the southern 
negro with a balanced if not easily di- 
gested ration. A meal may be perfectly 
well balanced and yet not be dietetically 
correct. 

Food for indoor and outdoor workers 

There are two great classes of workers, 
both needing a balanced ration but of a 
totally different kind. Roughly this 
balance should mean about three and 
one-half ounces each of proteids and fats 
with eleven ounces of carbohydrates. 
The first division includes those who 
engage in hard, muscular, outdoor 
work; the second includes those who 
are tied to a desk in a h&ted oifice, in 
school or in shop. The first, or out-of- 
door worker, with plenty of oxygen at 
hand and no hard brain labor, can digest 
more food and food difficult of digestion, 
because his blood supply is not called 
away from the digestive organs to the 
brain. Moreover, he needs the increased 
energy which is to be gotten from the 
increased supply, providing always he 
can digest it. A hearty breakfast, a 
hearty dinner in the middle of the day 
and a light supper at night is the best 
arrangement for this class of workers. 

If of sedentary habits, a light break- 
fast, a light luncheon and dinner at 
night is usually the best arrangement 
for an adult family. A young_ child 
should have his heartiest meal in the 
middle of the day. 

Fruits and green vegetables are made 
up almost entirely of water, or from SO 
to 90 per cent, with indigestible fiber, 
some sugar, mineral matter, fruit or 
vegetable acids and flavoring oils. Al- 
though low in nutritive value, they serve 



32 GENERAL INFORMATION 

two important uses in the dietary — they 
furnish bulk and ballast, their indi- 
gestible residue acting as a stimulus 
to intestinal movements, and they are a 
valuable source of mineral salts. A de- 
ficiency of green vegetables will cause 
eczema and scurvy. Again, they increase 
the palatability of a meal for most 
people, and indirectly aid nutrition, as 
the senses of sight, taste and smell have 
a definite influence on the digestive 
functions. 

The most readily available sources of 
proteid supply are the legumes, or beans 
and peas, corn meal, cheese, milk, figs 
and dates, eggs, nuts and flesh foods. 
These are arranged in the order of their 
cheapness. In general it will be seen 
that the vegetables are the cEeapest 
Sources of supply. 

The grains, root vegetables and fruits 
furnish most of the carbohydrate mate- 
rial. 

Fats are found in flesh foods, nuts, 
the yolk of egg, cheese, butter and olives. 

The most common method of measur- 
ing the nutritive value of foods has been 
by means of their burning or heat-givmg 
power. A unit of measurement, the 
calorie, was adopted for this purpose. 
The actual amount of heat necessary to 
raise a pound of water, practically a 
pint, four degtees Fahrenheit, is called 
the large calorie or unit of measurement. 
The number of degrees a given weight 
of food will raise the temperature is a 
fair index to its fuel value outside the 
body. But this method alone should 
not be relied upon as the heat and 
energy evolved within the body may be 
quite different. It has, however, a dis- 
tinct value in affording a means of com- 
parison of various foods, and in giving a 
general idea of their value. 

The coal range 

In selecting a coal range, the essen- 
tial qualifications may be summarized as 
follows : Checks and dampers so ar- 
ranged that they may be easily con- 
trolled, increasing and decreasing the 
heat at will; the oven space ample, with 
circulation of heated air to make the 
oven as hot on the bottom as on the top ; 
a fire box large enough to hold coal to 
the depth of seven inches; an arrange- 
ment for the water back that shall in- 
sure an abundant, clean supply of hot 
water; a good warming oven; a duplex

grate, and an ash pan guarded with 
chutes so that the ashes will fall directly 
into the pan and not outside. Avoid 
over-ornamentation in nickel, which col- 
lects dust. 

Properly cared for, a range should last 
from fifteen to twenty-five years, but it 
can be put out of commission in a 
much shorter time through carelessness 
or neglect. Most good housekeepers 
think there is less wear and tear on the 
stove to keep the range fire over night, 
especially in winter. 

To build and keep a fire 

In making a fire, be sure first that the 
grate is clean and the ash pan emptied 
so that there will be a free circulation 
of air. Place first a layer of shavings

or crumpled newspaper, for printers' ink 
is inflammable. Next to this foundation 
place fine pine splinters or kindling, with 
dried pieces of orange peel, peach pits 
or corncobs that you may happen -to 
have. Next a layer, of larger wood, 
reaching ends and sides. This helps the 
coal to kindle, and a stronger, more rapid 
blaze is obtained by its use. Light the 
paper from beneath and as soon as thor- 
oughly kindled, put on a sprinkling of 
coal, opening the direct chimney and 
oven drafts. As the wood burns away,

GENERAL INFORMATION 



add enough, more coal to keep even with 
the fire brides, but never over. 

To keep a brisk fire all day, it ia better 
to add a sprinkling of coal often, rather 
than to let it burn nearly out and then 
add a large quantity. 

At night shake the fire partially clear 
of ashes, then put on coal. After the 
blue flame point has passed, close or 
nearly close the drafts, and open the 
little sliding door that lets cold air 
over the fire box. If conditions allow, 
leave the window down to let out any 
gas that may escape. Close the doors 
leading from the kitchen to the other 
rooms. In the morning, before shaking 
down the fire, put on a little wood and 
a sprinkling of coal, then shake and 
open drafts. 

Don'ts from a stove repairer 

Don't heat a stove rapidly the first 
time. 

Don't pile the coal above the top of 
the fire box, nor allow the top of the 
stove to get red-hot. It warps and cracks 
the covers. 




Figure 2. The oven damper open, the bot air clrculat 
tag. arouud the oven 

Don't let your grate get clogged. 
Shake often and keep free from cinders 
and ashes. 

Don't let ashes remain in the ash pan. 
They absorb the heat, cool the oven and 
check the draft. 

Don't let clinkers remain fastened to 
the fire box. If the box is brick-lined, 
drop an oyster shell in the fire occasion- 
aUy, when burning briskly, and the shell 
will clean off the brick. 

Don't rush the range with the oven 
draft open. You use too much fuel and 
burn out the range too fast. 

Don't let the smoke draft stand open, 
except when fresh coal is put on. Heat 
that goes up the chimney is so much 
good money burned. 



GENERAL INFOKMATION 



35 



Don't bum wet garbage in the stove. 
D*y it first. Otherwise, steam is gener- 
ated and the moisture will injure the 
fire box. 

Don't set leaky vessels or spill cold 
water on the range. The cold coming 
in contact with the heated metal will 
crack it. To get spdts off when there 
has been a bad "spill over," cool the lids 
by changing them, or putting on coal. 
Clean with paper and finish with a 
scraper. 

Don't let the reservoir covers stand 
open, as it rusts the iron and strains the 
hinges. 

Don't let soot accumulate in the flue. 
Scrape off all soot that hangs to the 
oven bottom. Pull all soot toward you 
and be careful not to push it back into 
the flue. 

The gas range 

In buying a gas stove, ornamentation 
again should be a minor consideration. 
Much fretwork is a collector of dust 
and germs. Blue planished steel is dur- 
able and easy to ke^p clean. It does

not rust or discolor. Of distinct advan- 
tage, also, are strong, steel wire oven 
racks, that will not break or absorb 
heat; oven doors, spring poised, that do 
not open or shut with a jar; interlocking 
parts that can be removed for cleaning, 
without displacing screws or bolts; oven 
and broiler doors, interlined with heavy 
asbestos or aluminized steel; and legs to 
raise the range from the floor, high 
enough to permit sweeping underneath. 
The best burners are of one piece, 
obviating lea^ joints, and independ- 
ently supported, so that they are readily 
removable for cleaning. Covers, made 
with reducing rings to accommodate 
vessels of different sizes, and an arrange- 



36 GENERAL INFORMATION 

ment that places oven and broiler on top 
of the range, doing away with the stoop- 
ing posture when baking or broiling, are 
also of great convenience. For the for- 
getful one there is now a patented safety 
lighter, warranted to insure against ac- 
cident from explosion. The cocks are 
arranged with valves, by which the sup- 
ply of oxygen may be regulated. Among 
the axioms which might be hung beside 
the range with advantage to the cook 
and the gas bill are these: 

Matches are cheaper than gas. 

Never light a top burner until you 
are ready to use it. It gives the maxi- 
mum of heat when first lighted. 

Turn ofi a burner as soon as you have 
finished. 

In using the oven or broiler, light 
both burners a few moments before you 
are ready to bake or broil. 

Turn off the oven burners a few mo- 
ments before the cooking is finished, as 
the heat is retained in the oven several 
minutes after the burners are turned off. 

Never use a large burner when a small 
one will do the work. 

Keep your stove clean. Wash top and 
side pan daily, also the burners, greas- 
ing the latter slightly. If the burners 
clog, clean them with a wire. 

Once or twice a week, brush out your 
oven and if of iron, grease linings and 
sides with any animal fat that has no 
salt in it. Black the sides of the stove, 
if you will, but never the burners, as 
this would stop a full flow of gas. 

Wipe the nickel daily with a soft cloth, 
and, if tarnished, clean as you would 
silver. 

Never let a gas flame burn yellow or 
with a whistling noise. Turn out and 
light again, or, if necessary, regulate 
the supply of air by the valve in the 
cock until the flame burns blue and the 
whistling ceases. 

Never light the pilot or gas match 
without first opening the oven doors. 

Don't forget to put the pilot out when 
you are through with it. If you are 
going to leave the range unused for 
some time, wipe over with lard and 
cover with carpet or woolen. 

How to measure 

Careful and exact measuring is essen- 
tial in order to have satisfactory results 
in cooking. The measurements used in 
this cook book are level, in every instance 



GENERAL INFORMATION 37 

conforming to present cooking school 
standards. 

In measuring liquids a "cup" is all a 
cup will hold; flour is sifted once, the 
cup filled without packing, then leveled 
with a sharp knife. Butter is packed 
solid, then leveled. 

Use standard spoons and measuring 
cups known to contain exactly one-half 
pint. They should be marked in quar- 
ters and thirds. 

A tablespoon is measured level, then 
cut , lengthwise for a half tablespoon; 
the resulting half is then divided cross- 
wise for a quarter tablespoon. 

Weights may be translated into their 
equivalents by the following table : 

Table of weights and measures 

4 saltspoons make 1 teaspoon. 

3 teaspoons make 1 tablespoon. 

4 tablespoons make %, cup or % gill. 
2 gills make 1 cup. 

2 pints make 1 quart. 

4 quarts make 1 gallon. 

4 cups of flour make 1 pound. 

2 cups of butter make 1 pound. 

2 cups of granulated sugar make 1 
pound. 

3 cups of meal make 1 pound. 

2 cups of solid meat make 1 pound. 

1 tablespoon of liquid makes % ounce. 

2 tablespoons of butter make 1 ounce. 

4 tablespoons of flour make 1 ounce. 

3 tablespoons of sugar make 1 ounce. 

Modes of cooking 

The common methods of cooking are 
roasting, broiling, stewing, boiling, 
braising, sauteing and frying. 

Roasting is really cooking before a 
clear fire, but the modem oven ventilated 
and heated by radiation provides a good 
substitute for the ancient revolving spit. 

In broiling, the food is placed in an 
piled broiler and cooked over coals, under 
a gas flame or in an electric broiler. 
Turn often, every ten counts, at first, that 
the surface may be seared. Although 
there is considerable loss of weight in 
this method, none yields a finer flavor. 
A makeshift broiling may be accom- 
plished in a hissing hot unbuttered fry- 
ing pan. 

Boiling means to immerse the food in 
water or liquid at a temperature of 212 
degrees Fahrenheit or the boiling point 
at normal atmospheric pressure. Sim- 
mering indicates gentle boiling. In 



38 GENERAL INFORMATION 

simmering some portion of the liquid is 
boiling but in boiling proper every por- 
tion of the vessel of water has reached 
the required temperature. 

Stewing implies long cooking at sim- 
mering point in a small quantity of 
water or liquid. The aim is to soften 
the fibers aaid make a rich gravy by ex- 
tracting material from the food. 

Braising is now very popular and fash- 
ionable as well, since the attractive cas- 
seroles have been put on the market. 
The method implies long, slow cooking 
in a covered "dish with a small amount of 
liquid after the surface has first been 
seared by quiek, dry heat. 

In frying properly, the food is im- 
mersed in a bath of fat, the temperature 
varying with the material to be cooked. 
For croquettes and like codjed foods a 
small bit of bread must brown in forty 
counts, while for fritters, doughnuts 
and all uncooked foods, sixty counts is 
preferable. 

Manipulation 

To stir is to intimately incorporate 
materials by means of a circular motion 
whose radius gradually increases. It 
is the most common method in use. 

To beat is to incorporate air into the 
mixture by means of an up and down 
stroke, combined with the circular mo- 
tion. 

To cut and fold is a double motion by 
which the air already beaten in is pre- 
vented from escaping. Use a silver 
knife, cut downward with a clean, sharp 
strdce, then bring the batter at the bot- 
tom of the mixing bowl up and over, 
folding it in. Co|itiiiue until the coni- 
bming process is completed. 

A soft custard is stirred to prevent 
curdling; the white of an egg is beaten 
until double in bulk from the entangled 
air; the flonr for a sponge cake is care- 
fully cut and folded in to pievent loss of 
air. 



The Recipes 



Beverages 



Cocoa 

Boil one and one-half tablespoons of 
cocoa in one-half cup of water until 
smooth, glossy and thickened, then add 
two cups each of milk and water or one 
quart of milk. Heat but do not allow 
it to boil again and just before serving 
beat vigorously with an egg beater. 
This "milling" improves the texture and 
brings out the flavor. 

Tea 

Scald an earthen or china teapot. 
In this place two teaspoons of tea and 
pour over it a pint of freshly boiling 
water. Place on the back of range to 
steep five minutes. 

Iced Tea 

Cool rapidly fresh made tea. Fill the 
glasses one-half with finely chopped ice, 
fill up with tea, sweeten with sugar 
syrup and add a slice of lemon, orange 
or lime. 

Sugar Syrup 

Boil two cups of sugar with two cups 
of water ten minutes. Bottle while hot 
and seal. Use in place of sugar for 
punches, ices and frozen desserts. 

Coffee 

Mix one cup of coffee with one of 
cold water, beat together and add six 
cups of boiling water. Boil three min- 
utes, stir and add one-fourth cup of 
very cold water to settle. 

Iced Cocoa 

Make the cocoa a little stronger than 
usual, and when cool put it in the ice 
box till thoroughly chilled. Chopped 
ice may be added. Just before serving 
add a little vanilla. Serve with sugar 
and cream. 

BlacJcberry Bounce 

Stew a peck of blackberries, then 
strain through a flannel bag. To one 
quart of juice put one pound of sugar. 
Boil five minutes and skim. When cold 
put one quart of brandy to four quarts 
of juice. Spice to taste.

42 BKVERAGES 

Oinger Gobbler 

Slice into a large mixing bowl one 
pared cucumber, two oranges and three 
lemons ; sprinkle with a cup of powdered 
sugar and pour over a cup of preserved 
ginger syrup. Place in the ice chest for 
two hours to chill and ripen, then add 
one cup of thick sugar syrup and two 
quarts of ginger ale. Place a square 
block of ice in a glass punch bowl, gar- 
nished with large red raspberries and 
bunches of ripe currants; pour the 
effervescing cobbler over it and serve 
immediately. 

Lime Sherbet 

Squeeze the juice from four limes; 
strain and add a cup of raspberry 
vinegar, two cups of pulverized sugar 
and half a cup of grated cocoanut. 
Cover and place directly on the ice for 
two hours, then pour in gradually a cup 
of iced tea, adding three sliced oranges 
and the stiffly whipped whites of two 
eggs. Prepare a lime syrup by boiling 
two quarts of water with one quart of 
sugar for twenty minutes, adding the 
juice and grated rind of four limes; 
remove from the fire and when thor- 
oughly chilled, add to the rest. 

Sassafras Mead 

Purchase from the druggist five 
bunches of sassafras roots, scrape and 
cover with two quarts of boiling water, 
adding a pinch each of powdered cinna- 
mon and grated . nutmeg ; cover closely, 
and when of the desired strength, strain 
through cheesecloth, stirring in three 
pints of New Orleans molasses, a pint 
and a half of strained white honey and 
six whole cloves. Plactf in a granite 
saucepan and bring slowly to the boiling 
point, allowing it to simmer for about 
ten minutes; again strain and add a 
heaping tablespoon of cream of tartar 
and seal in air-tight bottles. Serve in 
tall slender glasses containing two table- 
spoons of shaved ice and a liberal pinch 
of bicarbonate of soda; fill quickly with 
the mead and stir vigorously with a long 
handled spoon, adding a teaspoon of 
minced candied orange peeL 

Raspberry Vinegar 

Put two quarts of fresh, ripe rasp- 
berries in a stone or china vessel, and 
pour on them a quart of vinegar. Let 
stand twenty-four hours, then strain

through a sieve. Pour the liquid over 
two quarts of fresh raspberries and let 
stand again twenty-four hours. Then 
strain a second time. Allow one pound 
of loaf sugar to every pint of juice. 
Break up the sugar and let it melt in 
the liquor. Put the whole into a stone 
jar, cover closely and set it in a kettle 
of boiling water, which must be kept at 
a quick boil for one hour. Skim, and 
when cold bottle the vinegar for use. 
Poured over cracked ice with a little 
water added, it makes a most refreshing 
summer beverage. 

Hungarian Caffe Cup 

Prepare a pint of very strong black 
coffee, flavoring with a few drops of 
ahnond extract; strain and place in the 
double boiler, combining when just at 
the boiling point with two well beaten 
eggs, two tablespoons of sugar and four 
tablespoons of thick cream; cook only 
until the custard coats the back of the 
spoon, and when perfectly cold fold in 
a cup of sweetened whipped cream. Add 
a quart of ice cold effervescent water 
and a pint of shaved ice, serving in tall 
sherbet glasses.

Cereals 



Cereals should be purchased in small 
quantities and kept in air-tight jars se- 
curely covered. In large quantities, it 
is difficult to prevent infection from 
insect life. The package directions in 
nearly every case allow too short a time 
for proper cooking. Double the time 
and the results vyill be more healthful 
and appetizing. Use a double boiler and 
mix the finer preparations with a little 
cold water, then add to the boiling water. 
This prevents the mixture cooking un- 
evenly in lumps. Allow one teaspoon of 
salt to each cup of cereal.

Breads and Biscuits 

Bread 

Put four tablespoons of shortening, 
either butter and lard mixed or one of 
the good fats on the market, two table- 
spoons of sugar and one tablespoon of 
salt into a bread raiser, and pour over 
it one quart of boiling water. Place one 
yeast cake in half a cup of lukewarm 
water and stir with a teaspoon till 
softened. When the water in the bread 
pan becomes lukewarm, pour in the yeast 
and stir thoroughly. Add five cups of 
sifted bread flour, beating it as it goes in 
with a wire whisk. When it becomes too 
thick to move with the whisk, use a 
slitted wooden spoon and stir thoroughly, 
so that the flour and wetting may become 
well mixed. Add flour enough to knead. 
When it is spongy but not dry, turn it 
out on a well-floured molding cloth and 
knead. It is the kneading that gives it 
the satiny smoothness and the elasticity 
which are invariable tests of good bread. 
It ought, even during this process, to 
begin to show bubbles in its texture. 
Knead them out, as much as possible. 
When dough is put back in the pan to 
rise with bubbles showing here and 
there, it will be full of holes and poor 
of taste when baked. After the knead- 
ing is flnished and the dough feels as 
smooth as silk, wash the bread raiser 
and dry it, then rub well inside with 
butter or lard before putting the dough 
back again for the second raising. In 
the morning when well risen, cut it 
down. By this process I mean cutting 
the light spongy mass through and 
through half a dozen times and then 
turning it over and over to check fer- 
mentation for a short time. The cut- 
ting takes only a minute or two, and 
one can feel that if it is not attended to 
for half an hour, the bread will not sour. 
It does not hurt it at all if it has to be 
cut down a second time. When ready 
to care for it, toss on the floured mold- 
ing cloth and knead again — slightly this 
time — tiU every air bubble disappears, 
then put it in greased pans, having each 
one about half full. Cover lightly, set 
in a warm place and allow it to double 
its bulk before putting to bake.

This recipe will make, four good-sized 
loaves. The oven, to give satisfactory 
results, ought to be quite hot when_ the 
bread is first put in. If you bake in a 
gas stove, the best plan is to light both 
burners seven or eight minutes before 
the bread goes in. Set it on the bottom 
shelf, then allow it to rise to double its 
bulk and begin to brown very slightly. 
Turn out one burner and finish the bak- 
ing in a cooler oven. This does away 
with any fear of burning; it bakes the 
bread perfectly and gives a much nicer 
crust than if the oven is very hot all the 
time. The management of dampers in 
a coal or wood stove will give the same 
results. According to the size of your 
loaves, bread will require from forty-five 
to sixty minutes to bake well. On taking 
it from the oven set the loaves on a wire 
stand or sieve to cool. Never wrap them 
steaming hot in a towel. Frequently 
one tastes the cloth in which bread has 
been wrapped, or the soap with which 
the cloth was washed. Besides, it shuts 
the steam up in the loaf, making it damp 
and clammy, a sure medium for the cul- 
tivation of mold. Allow the bread to 
become perfectly cold before putting it 
away in the bread box or jar, then keep 
it closely covered. 

The first and most important "must*- 
have" is good yeast. I have come to de- 
pend almost wholly and with the most 
perfect trust on compressed yeast. If 
your grocer keeps yeast at all, it will be 
fresh, the manufacturer sees to that, as 
the stock of each day is renewed and the 
old yeast cakes are taken away. Still, if 
you keep it yourself for a few days in 
a refrigerator it will not spoil. Yeast 
which is moist, light colored and of "re- 
viving smell," as an old lady I know 
expressed it, is all right. If it gets dry, 
brittle, streaky and smells the opposite of 
"reviving," throw it away; better lose 
two cents than twenty cents' worth of 
flour, with fire and labor added. Be very 
careful of the heat of the water in which 
yeast is softened. If you have a ther- 
mometer, let the water be sixty-five to 
sixty-eight degrees ; if you have to trust 
to your hand, let it be very surely no 
more than lukewarm. 

Then the flour — it is an invariable rule 
to use bread flour when yeast is to be 
added. Bread flour will make tolerable 
pie or cake, but pastry flour will not 
make good bread. If, as occasionally 



MEMORANDA 51 



52 BREADS AND BISCUITS 

occurs, you have flour whose nature you 
cannot determine, use the following test : 
take a handful and close the fingers 
tightly over it. If it remains in a soft 
velvety lump, even after the fingers are 
loosened, it is pastry flour. Bread flour 
will be dry and loose, it will not keep 
in shape. 

According to the time at your dis- 
posal, allow sufficient yeast for raising. 
For instance, if bread is wanted made 
and baked in four hours, two yeast cakes 
would have to be allowed to the recipe I 
have given. There is no danger, should 
compressed yeast be used, of its tasting 
in the bread. This is called the quick- 
raising method. In a temperature of 
about sixty-eight degrees it will be ready 
to mold two and a half hours from the 
time it was set. It will be quite as good 
bread as that made after the slow-raising 
method, although I think the latter will 
keep moist for a longer time. 

I have heard many housewives com- 
plain of bread souring. Bread sours only 
because of two reasons — uncleanliness in 
the making or the utensils, or because it 
was allowed to stand too long after mix- 
ing. When that occurs, the yeast has 
done its work completely, and the dan- 
gerous bacteria get in their work, exactly 
in the same way as at the point where 
cider changes to vinegar. I have found, 
too, that in hot weather milk bread will 
sour much more quickly than if bread 
is mixed with water. Then there is the 
question of dry bread, with a heavy feel- 
ing about it, both to the touch and to the 
palate. Usually this is caused either by 
too much flour being worked into the 
dough or by heavy-handed kneading. 
Bread, like cake, pastry, cookies and 
biscuit, has a point where just enough 
flour has been added and where no more 
ought to go in. This amount it is al- 
most impossible for a recipe maker to 
determine, because there are so many 
flours, and the wetting capacities of two 
are hardly ever alike. It is a case of ex- 
perience. A practiced hand can tell 
almost the instant when enough flour has 
gone into bread by a certain springy 
feeling. Then tip it out and begin 
kneading. It may seem moist, but it is 
not moist enough to stick if you inter- 
vene with well-floured fingers between 
the dough and the cloth. Knead quickly 
and lightly; a heavy hand which pounds 
bread instead of molding it wiU soon

bread will have the texture of cheese. 

Hot Cross Buns 

Beat to a cream one large cup of 
granulated sugar and one scant cup of 
butter. Add gradually three eggs beaten 
well and one pint of scalded milk, blood 
warm. Add one yeast cake softened in 
one-half cup of lukewarm water. Put 
in flour enough to make a batter as 
stifE as you can beat it. Beat until it 
blisters well. In the morning knead rap- 
idly, but do not use over one-half cup of 
flour in the kneading. Dough must be 
very soft. Rub over top with a little 
warm butter and let rise. When double 
in bulk cut into balls like tea biscuit. 
Eub each bun with a little butter and 
make a cross on top with a sharp knife. 
Let rise in pans one and one-half or two 
hours. Bake one-half hour. 

Buttermilk Biscuits 

One cup buttermilk or sour milk, one- 
half teaspoon soda, one-half teaspoon 
salt, three tablespoons lard and flour. 
Work the lard into the milk with the 
hand. Add one cup flour, sifted with 
soda and salt, more flour to make a 
dough and knead until smooth and elas- 
tic as for light bread. EoU out until 
one-half inch thick, cut and bake in a 
hot oven ten or fifteen minutes. The bis- 
cuits must be thin, almost cracker-like, 
and you have the real southern biscuit. 
It seems best to work in the lard in this 
way. 

Steamed Brown Bread 

One and one-quarter cups of Indian 
meal, one cup of graham meal and three- 
quarters cup of rye meal; one teaspoon 
of soda and one-half teaspoon of salt; 
three-quarters cup of molasses, two cups 
sour milk or hot water. Mix and sift dry 
ingredients, and return siftings to the 
finer part. (This sifting is to make it 
lighter, not to tako out the coarse grains.') 
Add molasses, then sour milk or hot 
water, beat well and pour into an oiled 
tin with tight cover. Place to steam 
either in a steamer or in a tightly cov- 
ered kettle partly filled with boiling 
water. Steam three or four hours, then 
dry off in the oven.

Johnnycake 

Sift one-half cup each of corn meal, 
flour and sugar, one-half teaspoon of 
soda, and one-half teaspoon of salt, thor- 
oughly together. Add one and one- 
fourths cups of sour milk. Use butter- 
milk if you have it. Beat thoroughly, 
pour into cake pan and bake in a hot 
oven. 

Date Buns 

Koll light bread dough out quite thin, 
spread it with soft butter, and then with 
chopped dates. EoU the bread up and 
cut with a sharp knife into pieces half 
an inch thick, lay them in a buttered 
pan, let them rise until double in bulk, 
and bake in a hot oven. 

Oatmeal Bread 

Pour one quart of boiling water over 
two cups of oatmeal and one tablespoon 
of shortening; when lukewarm add one- 
half of a compressed yeast cake, softened 
in two tablespoons of lukewarm water, 
one cup of molasses, and one teaspoon of 
salt, thicken with wheat flour until as 
stiff as can be stirred with a spoon. Let 
rise over night and in the morning mold 
into loaves and biscuits. 

Breadsticks 

Scald a cup of milk and add three 
tablespoons of sugar with one-half tea- 
spoon of salt. When the right temper- 
ature (lukewarm), add a yeast cake 
softened in a little warm water. Too 
much water prevents the yeast mixing 
evenly. Add the stiffly beaten white of 
an egg and enough flour to knead. 
Knead well, using the palms of the 
hands and pushing it from you on 
the board with a sliding motion. When 
it is smooth and satiny to the touch, 
keeps its round shape, and does not stick 
to the board or hand, it is ready to be 
placed in a clean oiled bowl. Knead in 
all the flour that will be needed at this 
time, if not, the yeast will have no op- 
portunity to raise it sufficiently. On the 
other hand, use no more than is abso- 
lutely necessary. Flours vary and for 
this reason no deflnite quanitity can be 
given. Cover tightly in order that no 
crust need form. When it is double in 
bulk, knead aerain with just enough 
flour to keep it from sticking. Then roll

medium-sized biscuit cutter. 

To shape the Parker House rolls, 
spread each biscuit with a very thin 
layer of butter, then with a caseknife 
crease through the center, fold over and 
press the edges closely together. Do not 
butter the baking tin, and place them 
far enough apart to prevent their touch- 
ing, even after they are raised. 

KoU the biscuits between the palms 
until from eight to ten inches long, of 
uniform size and with well rounded 
ends. Let them rise; bake and serve 
these breadsticks with soup or the salad. 
Brush three sticks lightly with melted 
butter and braid loosely. Two sticks 
twisted make another variation. In 
twisting or braiding allow plenty of 
room for the dough to rise, otherwise 
the distinctive shape will be lost. 8hape 
others like a horseshoe, using a plain 
breadstick, and tie sailors' or true lovers' 
knots; both of these latter are effective. 

"Pocketbooks" need an oblong piece 
of dough cut with one end pointed. 
Brush with melted butter and fold in 
thirds, leaving the pointed end on top. 
Press firmly together at the point. 
When baked they should open like a 
pocketbook in three crisp folds.' See 
Page 8. 

Rusks 

Scald one cup of milk and add two 
tablespoons each of butter and sugar, 
with a half teaspoon of salt. When 
warm add one-half a yeast cake softened 
in two tablespoons of warm water. Now 
stir in enough flour to make a stiff bat- 
ter, beat it until smooth, cover and 
let it rise. When risen add two eggs 
beaten until very light, and flour enough 
to handle; knead until smooth and let 
it rise again. Then roll out as the bis- 
cuit dough. Make into round biscuits 
and with a floured dull knife press 
through- the center. When light bake 
them in a moderate oven. If the twice 
baked rusk is liked, mold into long, 
oblong rolls, and when baked, cut in 
inch slices, and dry in the oven to a 
golden brown. See Page 9.

Waffles and Griddlecakes 

Waffles 

Mix one pint of flour, three-fourths 
pint clabber (if you use buttermilk, a 
pint), one teaspoon salt, one tablespoon 
melted lard, and beat till perfectly 
smooth — ^beat hard and long, for success 
will depend on it. Just before you put 
in the irons add one level teaspoon of 
soda dissolved in a teaspoon of hot 
water. Heat the waffle iron, turn and 
heat on the other side, then oil thor- 
oughly. Put a tablespoon of batter in 
each compartment; then cover and it 
will soon fill the iron. Turn at once. 
With a new iron oil carefully or waffles 
will stick. 

Pumpkin Waffles 

Take one cup of mashed and seasoned 
pumpkin, carefully drained, and add one 
well beaten egg, one cup of warm cream, 
half a yeast cake dissolved in half a cup 
of lukewarm water, one tablespoon of 
melted butter and four cups of sifted 
flour; thin to a rather thick batter 
with sweet milk; allow it to rise until 
light and then beat down, adding a pinch 
of powdered mace and ground ginger; 
again let it rise for twenty minutes and 
bake in heated waffle irons to a golden 
brown; dip the waffles while hot in 
melted butter and roll in equal parts of 
cinnamon and pulverized sugar. 

Rye Pancakes 

One pint of sour milk, one egg, three 
cups of rye meal, one cup of Indian 
meal, one-half cup of molasses, one small 
teaspoon of soda, small teaspoon of salt. 
Mix well and fry in smoking hot fat; 
dip the spoon first in the hot fat, then 
take up a piece of the dough a little 
larger than an English walnut, using 
the tip of the spoon. Shape it a little as 
you take it up, then drop it quickly into 
the fat. These require longer cooking 
than doughnuts. Eoll, while still hot, 
in sugar and serve with coffee. Or serve 
them plain with maple syrup.

Eggs 



Fried Eggs 

Separate the yolks from the whites and 
put very little lard in the pan. Break 
the yolks and spread them all over the 
pan after it is b.ot. Season to taste and, 
beginning at one edge, roll the yolks into 
a cylindrical shape and allow it to cook 
a few minutes. Now turn the whites 
into the skillet without any more lard, 
ev.en though the skillet appears to be 
dry, spread the whites over the bottom 
of pan, season quickly and roll as before ; 
let this cook in the roll. It will not burn 
as there is plenty of water in an egg to 
prevent it. The result of this method 
is a light, fluffy morsel. 

Plain Omelet 

Crack into a bowl six fresh eggs, season 
delicately with salt and white pepper 
and beat until well mixed. Drop a table- 
spoon of butter into a heated omelet pan, 
and as soon as the butter is hot pour 
in the eggs and with a spatula stir all 
well together for three minutes. Let 
cook undisturbed for a moment, then 
fold the side next the pan handle to 
the center, fold the opposite side in the 
same manner and slip carefully to a hot 
dish. Serve immediately. 

Eggs au Gratin 

Mix together three raw egg yolks, a 
quarter of a cup of soft, fresh bread 
crumbs, two tablespoons of softened 
butter, one tablespoon of chopped chives, 
three chopped sardines, two sprigs of 
parsley chopped, and a light dusting of 
salt and pepper. Spread this mixture in 
the bottom of a baking dish and place 
in a slow oven until set; then break over 
it six eggs, dust them with salt and 
pepper and bake until done. 

Eggs Vermicelli

hard cooked eggs. Chop the whites 
and rub the yolks through a sieve. Melt 
a tablespoon of butter; when bubbling,

pepper, and, if liked, a few drops of 
onion juice. Beat only until thoroughly 
blended, then add gradually a cup of 
rich new milk. Divide equally among 
six well buttered timbale molds (com- 
mon cups will serve the purpose). Stand 
them in a pan half filled with hot water 
and bake in a moderate oven about 
twenty minutes, or until firm to the 
touch. Turn out carefully on a heated 
platter and pour bread sauce around. 

Spanish Eggs 

Cut six circles of bread from a stale 
loaf and fry to a brown crispness in hot 
butter. Fry six eggs in hot olive oil, 
allowing one egg for each circle of 
bread; when the eggs are done trim the 
edges (a biscuit cutter is the most sat; 
isfactory implement to use when desir- 
ous of a shapely result) and lay one on 
each bread round, pour over a pint of 
Spanish sauce and serve piping hot. 

Eggs and Cheese 

Cut out rounds of bread an inch thick, 
remove a small piece in the center of 
each, dip in melted butter anA fill the 
cavity with finely chopped cheese and 
celery. Bake fifteen minutes in a hot 
oven and place a poached egg in the 
center of each slice. Serve with toasted 
crackers and sliced lemon. 

Luncheon Eggs with Spinach 

Cook six eggs very hard; cool and cut 
in halves lengthwise. Take two cups of 
cold spinach, heat it in a few tablespoons 
of water, drain and rub through a col- 
ander or chop very fine. Mix with pep- 
per, salt and butter, place it in the bot- 
tom of an earthen dish, lay the halves of 
eggs about on the spinach and pour over 
them a cream sauce, made from one cup 
of milk thickened and seasoned with salt, 
paprika and about four tablespoons of 
mild grated cheese. Cover with crumbs 
and set in the oven. Serve when slightly 
browned.

Fish 



In selecting fish the purchaser should 
see that the skin and scales are bright, 
the eyes full and clear and the flesh firm. 
Beware of fish that is unusually cheap; 
it has probably been kept in cold storage 
and is far from fresh. Canned fish 
should be used with discretion, always re- 
moving it immediately on opening the 
tin and letting it stand for an hour or 
more before using, to absorb oxygen. 

It is economy to buy a whole cod or 
haddock weighing three or four pounds, 
as the whole fish is much cheaper than 
when sliced and all of it can be utilized. 

Try this method of preparing a cod or 
haddock. Clean and wipe the fish, cut 
off the head, cut the flesh from the back- 
bone in two long strips. Put the head 
and bones over the fire in cold water and 
cook for one hour, to make a fish stock, 
as there is much gelatine in the head, and 
some flesh clings to the bones. Strain 
this stock and reserve it as a basis for a 
fish chowder, adding potatoes, milk, on- 
ion, salt pork and crackers according to 
any good chowder recipe. The fillets of 
fish freed from the bones may be used for 
baking. 

Among the most delicate fish for broil- 
ing are lake or salmon trout and white- 
fish, which are fresh water fish from the 
great lakes and are in season during the 
winter. Broiling seems to be a simple 
process, yet it requires care and attention 
to prepare the fish without burning it. 
Everything should be made ready for 
serving before starting to broil the fish, 
which must be watched, turned and 
timed. With a bright hot fire which 
broiling requires, a fish one-inch thick 
will cook in twelve to fifteen minutes, 
more time being needed for a thick fish 
like salmon, bluefish or shad. Use a 
double wire broiler well greased with salt 
pork to keep the fish from breaking and 
sticking. I^y the fish over the fire, flesh' 
side down, and broil it till it is a golden 
brown, lifting occasionally if necessary. 
Cook it from eight to twelve minutes, 
then turn onto the skin side and broil 
it four or five minutes. Remove to a 
hot platter, rub the fish wili soft butter, 
garnish with parsley and quarters of 
lemon and serve. Halibut, cod, salmon 



MEMORANDA 



80 FISH 

steaks, bluefish, mackerel, biitterfisli,_8ea 
trout and shad are good fish for broiling. 
If cut very thick the cooking may be 
completed in the oven. 

There are two methods of frying, one 
is to immerse the fish in "boiling oil" 
and the other to fry it in a pan with salt 
pork scraps ; the latter is th- more "tasty" 
the former more rapid and less likely to 
absorb fat if the fish is drained on brown 
paper. Small fish like trout, smelts, 
perch and pickerel are dipped whole in 
flour, Indian meal or egg and crumbs, 
and fried crisp. Cod, halibut, haddock, 
flounders, sole, etc, are cut in slices or 
fillets dipped and fried either way. 

In boiling or steaming fish much is lost 
or wasted by absorption into the boiling 
water, or by evaporation. Boiling is far 
from an economical process, but is often 
convenient. A thick, solid piece of fish 
is required, salmon, cod, halibut and red 
snapper being best to boil. 

Molded Fish 

Butter an oval mold, lay in it a strip 
of boned fish, then a layer of bread 
crumbs seasoned with melted butter, on- 
ion juice, chopped parsley and lemon 
juice, pepper, salt and curry, if liked. 
Add more fish and crumbs till the mold 
is full. Moisten with one-half cup of 
milk or water and the whole or white of 
one egg, to bind the mixture together. 
Sprinkle buttered crumbs on top, bake 
for one-half hour, unmold on a platter 
and serve with Spanish sauce. Oysters 
dipped in buttered crumbs may be substi- 
tuted for the seasoned crumbs, and a 
HoUandaise sauce used. 

Baked Fillets 

Each large fillet is cut into three or 
four small ones and dipped in flour, to 
which has been added a little salt and 
pepper. On a rest in the meat pan are 
placed strips of fat salt pork and sliced 
onion and on these are placed the flllets. 
On each one place a bit of butter and a 
slice of onion, cover and bake in a mod- 
erate oven until thoroughly cooked. 
(The unpardonable sin, by the way, is to 
serve fish in a translucent, underdone 
condition.) Remove the fillets carefully, 
rejecting the pork and onion, and serve 
with parsley sauce, a white sauce with 
chopped parsley added. Garnish with 
sliced hard-cooked eggs and parsley.

Baked Stuffed Fish 

Prepare a stuffing with one-half cup of 
bread crumbs, one-fourth cup of melted 
butter, one-half cup of cracker crumbs, 
a few drops of onion juice, one-fourth 
teaspoon of salt, one-eighth teaspoon of 
pepper, one tablespoon of chopped^ pars- 
ley, two tablespoons of chopped pickles. 
Bind together with hot water. Lay one- 
half a boned fish on a tin sheet in a bak- 
ing pan, add the stuffing in a layer, then 
the second strip of fish and bake for one- 
half hour. Serve with egg sauce. 

Halibut with Lemon Sauce 

Put into a saucepan containing a pint 
of water, one small onion minced, a tea- 
spoon of butter, two pods of red pepper, 
a teaspoon of salt and one and one-half 
pounds of halibut cut into slices. When 
cooked remove fish and thicken the liq- 
uid with a tablespoon of flour or corn- 
starch. Break into a separate dish six 
eggs into which has been stirred the juice 
of six lemons. Add slowly, to prevent 
curdling, the liquor from the fish. Cook 
in a double boiler, stirring all the time. 
When thick as custard, remove from the 
fire and place fish in a deep platter, pour- 
ing sauce over all. Serve cold, garnished 
with parsley. 

Haddock a la Creole 

Place a filleted haddock on the rack 
in the meat pan. Make a thin tomato 
sauce of one quart of strained tomatoes, 
two slices of onion, two or three cloves, 
one-quarter cup each of flour and butter ; 
season well with salt and pepper and 
pour half of it over the fish. Cook an 
hour in a moderate oven, basting it three 
or four times. When done, remove to 
the serving dish and pour over it the 
remaining tomato sauce. 

Fish a la Lee 

Split and bone a bluefish and place on 
a well-buttered sheet. Cream one-quar- 
ter cup butter, add two egg yolks and 
stir until well blended, then add two 
tablespoons each of onion, capers, pickles 
and parsley, finely chopped, three table- 
spoons lemon juice, one-half teaspoon 
salt, and one-quarter teaspoon pepper. 
Sprinkle fish with salt, spread with mix- 
ture and bake in a hot oven.

of butter, a grating of leeks, some very 
finely grated parsley and a sprinkle of 
dry cracker crumbs; a suspicion of salt 
and pepper. In opening see that none 
of the liquor of the oyster is lost, as it 
is needed for moisture. Make the cov- 
ering very thin and bake in the shell 
on a flat pan in the oven for ten minutes, 
or until the shell takes a slight tinge of 
brown. Serve very hot with breadsticks.

Meats 



The beef creature is divided down the 
middle of the backbone into sides or 
halves, which are shipped to aU sections 
of the country. The next cut is purely 
local and divides into fore and hindquar- 
ters, leaving as many ribs on the fore- 
quarter as the butcher desires. A com- 
mon practice, at least in the east, is to 
leave ten ribs on the forequarter. 

The shoulder blade begins on the fifth 
rib and the five ribs from the neck to 
the shoulder blade are called chuck; the 
next five, whether on hind or forequar- 
ter, are the prime ribs, and ihe eleventh 
is what is often called the tip of the 
sirloin, from its position, when hung up. 
One reason this is prized so highly is 
that in hanging, there is a constant tend- 
ency to force the meat juices toward 
this portion, making the roast juicy as 
well as tender. 

The neck piece will furnish stews or 
Hamburg steak for the least expenditure. 
It is often used for mincemeat. From 
the chuck ribs, small steaks and roasts 
of good flavor may be obtained, while 
for a pot roast, choose a portion from 
the back of the forequarter. It will in-, 
elude some of the vertebrae, which wiU 
help to swell the stock kettle. 

The cut sometimes called sticking 
piece, whose name is suggestive of its 
position on the under side of the neck, 
is very satisfactory braised or cooked in 
hot water with herbs and spices, and 
served with a tomato sauce. 

Another cut called rattle rand, con- 
tains the thin, flat ends of the chuck 
and prime ribs, and joins the stick- 
ing piece. It is no misnomer, espe- 
cially at the thin end where the rattle is 
plain. This is oftenest used for corn- 
ing. 

The hindquarter cuts are much more 
familiar. Here are found the most of 
the roasts and steaks and the economical 
cuts depend to some measure on local 
demand. An unsalable portion, in one 
section of the country, may be cheap, 
while in another it is better known, and 
therefore somewhat higher in price. 

From the ribs toward the hips, the 
muscles covering the backbone are called 
loin. The one on the outside is the sir- 



MEMORANDA 



9Q MEATS 

loin, knighted by one of England's kings. 
The inner muscle, dry but tender, is 
known as tenderloin. The tenderloin 
is often roasted as a fillet, larded" with 
salt pork to supply the fat it lacks. Next 
come the muscles just over the hip bones 
called rump. If cut correctly this is 
tender, but is boneless and lacks the in- 
describable flavor the bone imparts to 
meat. Between the rump and the round 
is a wedgeshaped piece called the aitch 
bone. This is sometimes inexpensive, 
and makes an excellent roast. The price 
usually varies, being higher in direct 
ratio to the number of pounds. If the 
butcher will cut eight Spounds, it is de- 
cidedly an economical choice. 

The round is divided into upper, lower 
and vein cuts. The upper takes its name 
from the position on the butcher's block, 
and is the choicest ; the lower is good for 
braising or any casserole use, while the 
vein is the muscle on the front part of 
the leg. The first three slices make very 
good steak, or the whole makes an eco- 
nomical rqast. See Pages 12 and 13. 

The longer meat is hung, the tenderer 
becomes the fiber, but if allowed to ripen 
too long the meat is unhealthful. The 
craving for "gamey" meat is usually 
an acquired one and leads to digestive 
disorders. If beef is clear in color, firm 
yet springy to the touch, well marbled 
or streaked with fat of a clear yellowish 
tinge and with a thick rim of fat on the 
outside, the meat will be satisfactory. 

Meat should be removed from the 
paper as soon as it comes from the mar- 
ket, as the paper absorbs the juices. 
Wipe with a damp cheesecloth or bit of 
linen but never place fresh meat or poul- 
try in water to soak even for five min- 
utes, as cold water extracts the juices. 

In roasting meats allow fifteen min- 
utes to heat the piece through and ten 
minutes for each pound if liked rare, or 
if wanted well done, twelve minutes ad- 
ditional for each pound. For poultry^ 
game and pork, allow fifteen minutes for 
each pound.

Oven Stew 

Buy two or three pounds of the shin 
of beef (from the small end). Have 
the bone broken into three or four pieces. 
After wiping it with a danip cloth, re-

into small pieces for serving. Scrape 
the marrow from the bone and place in 
a kettle and in it, brown first the meat, 
then the vegetables cut in cubes, — ^half 
an onion and one carrot. Now dredge 
well with flour and salt, adding about 
a tablespoon of browned flour to give 
color. Add one or two whole cloves, one-

catsup, then the pieces of bone. Cook in 
the oven in a deep iron meat-pan for 
three or four hours, adding potatoes, cut 
in cubes, one hour before serving.

Boast Turkey 

Insist on having the bird with the feet 
on, be it chicken or turkey, as the ten- 
dons may then be easily removed. Make 
a cut through the skin at the bend of 
the knee joint until the tendons are ex- 
posed; insert a trussing skewer under 
each and pull gently with a slight twist. 
Cut off the feet, clean and use for soup. 
Pick clean of pin feathers; even if the 
bird has been already drawn it is safe to 
look for lungs and windpipe. The former 
are found on either side of the backbone 
imbedded between the ribs. Remove 
every trace. Make a cut at one side un- 
der the wing to remove crop and wind- 
pipe as the appearance of the roasted 
fowl will not then be marred. 

Singe over two tablespoons of alcohol 
lighted in a shallow tin plate. Scrub the 
bird inside and out with cheesecloth 
dipped in warm water. Pold back the 
neck skin and with a sharp vegetable 
knife sever the neck close to the body. 
Cook with heart and liver for gravy. 
Stuff with any desired dressing, using 
only enough in the breast to plump it 
well. Fold the neck skin back, bend the 
wings over this and fasten with skewers. 
When the chicken is stuffed truss the 
drumsticks closely and fasten securely 
with skewers. Remember the fewer pro- 
jecting corners the more juicy and uni- 
formly cooked will' be the roasted bird. 
Follow the time table for cooking meats 
as given on Page 90.

minced turkey may be used in place of 
the combination. Stir the mixture over 
the fire for a moment, then set it aside 
to cool. When ready to bake the souffle, 
beat the whites of the three eggs very 
stifi, fold them lightly into the turkey 
mixture, and fiOll this into buttered 
ramekins, making them three-quarters 
fuU. Bake in a very quick oven for 
about fifteen minutes, and serve imme- 
diately to prevent falling. If a baking 
dish is used instead of ramekins, bake 
a little longer. 

Bucks Braised 

Draw and singe a pair of ducks, wipe 
them inside and out with a damp Cheese- 
cloth. Line a small pan with thin slices 
of bacon, sprinkle the bottom with 
minced parsley, thyme, grated lemon 
peel and a little finely chopped onion. 
Lay the ducks in, cover with a sliced 
carrot, three or four whole cloves, a table- 
spoon of currant jelly and a cup of stock. 
Set over the fire and let simmer one hour, 
basting frequently. Slice one large 
turnip,^ fry it in hot butter, turn into 
the saucepan, take up the ducks and set 
to keep warm; let the turnip cook for 
ten minutes; take the slices up, arrange 
on the dish around the ducks, strain the 
gravy, thicken it with a little browned 
flour, pour over, and serve the ducks 
very hot with currant jelly and lemon 
sliced. 

Spring Chicken 

Split the chickens down the back as 
for broiling, lay them breast down in a 
baking pan, filling the depression inside 
the ribs with equal quantities of finely 
minced onion, carrot, celery and peas; 
season~with salt and a dash of paprika, 
adding a generous lump of butter for 
each bird. Pour into the baking pan 
half a cup of hot water, to which has 
been added two tablespoons of mush- 
room catsup and cook in a hot oven for 
half an hour or until the vegetables are 
tender, basting frequently. Remove the 
vegetables and turn the chickens to 
brown the breasts slightly. Serve them 
covered with a sauce made from the 
same vegetables moistened with a very 
little hot cream. Garnish with tiny 
squares of fried hominy and sweet po- 
tato croquettes.

Shaker Fricasseed Chicken 

Cut up the chicken as for an ordinary 
fricassee, put in a kettle with a per- 
forated stand at the bottom to prevent 
burning, use water enough to steam and 
cook one hour, then add salt. When 
the meat is perfectly tender put it in 
the oven and brown thoroughly, then 
add rich cream to the gravy, thickening 
it with a little flour and butter, and 
seasoning to taste. Serve in deep dishes. 

Ham 

Twenty-four hours before a ham is to 
be used scrub it thoroughly with a veg- 
etable brush and cold, weak borax water. 
Then put into cold water and soak for 
twenty-four hours. If it is to be baked, 
it requires first about four hours' boiling. 
Use a big kettle, as the ham must be 
completely covered with water. Let it 
come to the boil very slowly. Remove 
the scum which rises. When it begins 
to boil add twelve whole cloves, twelve 
peppercorns, the outside stalks of one 
bunch of celery, two chopped onions, 
two cloves of garlic, one chopped carrot 
and turnip, two bay leaves, two blades 
of mace, twelve allspice berries and one 
quart of cider or a cup of vinegar. 
Never allow the ham to boil, merely 
to simmer slowly, that is one secret 
of making it tender. Allow about 
twenty-five minutes or half an hour 
to the pound. If the ham is to be 
used cold you can add to its tender 
juiciness by allowing it to stand in the 
pot liquor till nearly cold. Then lift 
it out, peel off the skin and roll it in 
dried bread crumbs with which three 
tablespoons of brown sugar have been 
sifted. Set it in ' the oven till the 
crumbs form a crisp brown crust. If 
the ham is to be baked, take it from the 
water, drain thoroughly, then take off the 
skin except around the shank, where it 
may be cut in Vandykes with a sharp 
pointed knife. Cover with crumbs and 
stick it full of cloves, then set in a mod- 
erate oven to bake for two hours. If 
you prefer the ham glazed, allow it to 
cool as for boiled ham, then skin, wipe 
dry and brush all over with beaten egg. 
Mix one cup of sifted cracker crumbs, a 
dash of salt and pepper, two tablespoons 
of melted butter and cream enough to 
make the crumbs into a paste. Spread 
it evenly over the ham, set in a moder- 
ate oven and bake tiU brown, then serve

hot with a brown sauce flavored with 
half a glass of sherry or champagne, if 
liked. When a baked or boiled ham goes 
to the table wrap about the unsightly- 
bone a ruffle of white tissue paper, gar- 
nish with hard boiled eggs cut in quar- 
ters. 

Potted Ham 

To four cups of finely minced ham add 
a seasoning of paprika and allspice, with 
just enough clarified butter to make it 
into a paste, then press into small jars 
and pour over it melted butter, which 
will harden and preserve it as paraffine 
does jelly. 

Scalloped Ham 

Make a thin, well seasoned white sauce 
and add to it cold boiled ham cut into 
small cubes. Pour into scallop dishes, 
cover with buttered crumbs and brown 
delicately in the oven. Garnish with 
rings of hard boiled white of egg and 
sprigs of blanched celery. 

Broiled Ham 

It should be cut in thin slices; put 
between the wires of a broiler and cook 
for five minutes, turning frequently, 
over a clear, hot fire. Serve on a hot 
platter with poached eggs. 

Corned Tongue 

Wash and trim out the roots of one 
or more fresh beef tongues. Put them 
into a stone jar, cover with brine, 
lay a plate over the meat and on this a 
stone to keep the meat under the brine. 
Cover securely, keep in a cold place and 
in a week they will be ready for use, 
although they will keep in the brine for 
several weeks in cold weather. 

Brine for Corning 

Put two quarts of water, three-quar- 
ters of a pound of salt, a quarter of a 
poimd of brown sugar and a fourth of 
an ounce of saltpeter together into a 
granite saucepan and heat to boiling. 
Cool and strain through cheesecloth. 
Pour it over the meat and add a tea- 
spoon of pepper, half a teaspoon of 
ginger, three bay leaves and two cloves 
of garlic. This amount of brine is 
sufficient for haK a dozen tongues. Calf 
tengue may be corned in the same way

and if desired, a piece of beef may be 
corned in the same brine with the 
tongties. 

Sausage and Apples 

Core four apples and slice across in 
one-fourth inch slices. Bake the sau- 
sages on a rack in a dripping pan. Fry 
the apples brown, using some of the 
fat extracted from the sausage. Serve 
on the same platter with the sausage. 

Skewered Liver 

Alternate small pieces of liver and 
bacon on skewers and bake in the oven 
or broil until done. This is a convenient 
and dainty way to serve a small amount. 

Sweetbreads 

Sweetbreads should be purchased as 
fresh as possible, and as they spoil very 
quickly, they should receive attention as 
soon as they arrive from the market. 
Soak in cold water an hour or longer, re- 
newing the water several times to extract 
aU the blood. Drain and let simmer in 
boiling salted water half an hour or un- 
til tender. Drain again, reserving the 
broth for subsequent cooking, and cover 
with cold water to keep them white and 
firm. When they are cooled, wipe them 
dry. Bemove all the tubes, outside skin 
and fibers, taking care not to break the 
sweetbreads into pieces. Sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and put into a cold place 
until needed. Sweetbreads should al- 
ways be parboiled in this manner, what- 
ever the subsequent mode of preparation. 
It insures their thorough cooking and 
makes them thicker, whiter and firmer. 

Lyownaise Tripe 

Clean and boil a fresh honeycomb 
tripe, then cut into strips about two 
and a half inches long and half an inch 
wide sufiflcient to make two cups. Put 
in a pan in the oven for a few minutes 
to draw out the water, then drain. 
Melt a tablespoon of butter, add a tea-- 
spoon of finely chopped onion, cook to 
a delicate brown and add the tripe, a 
teaspoon of finely minced parsley, a tea- 
spoon of vinegar and salt and pepper to 
taste. Simmer five minutes and serve 
plain or on toast.

Spinach (Swiss style) 

After the spinacli has been well 
washed and boiled with a little bakiag 
soda in the water to keep it green, put it 
in a strainer and squeeze out every bit 
of water. Now run it through the finest 
knife of the food chopper twice. Chop 
also very fine, a small onion or half a 
large one, and saute in a tablespoon of 
butter, not allowing it to brown. Add 
half a tablespoon of flour. When 
blended add one cup of well flavored 
stock, stir until free from lumps, then 
mix in the spinach. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper, and add a table- 
spoon of grated cheese. Serve garnished 
with slices of hard-cooked eggs.

cloves; allow these ingredients to sim- 
mer for thirty minutes, and then add 
an ounce of gelatine that has been 
soaked in half a cup of cold water for 
ten minutes, stirring until the gelatine 
is dissolved. Strain the aspic through 
a double cloth and mold the asparagus 
tips with alternating layers of hard- 
boiled eggs in an ornamental mold; 
this is easily accomplished by adding 
with a spoon only sufficient jelly to set 
each layer, and waiting until that is 
hard and firm before arranging the 
next in place; at serving time unmold, 
garnish with bunches of cress and serve 
with graham bread sandwiches.

all the salt necessary for seasoning. 

Tomato Cups with Corn Cream Filling 

Remove the pulp from twelve ears of 
sweet corn, season delicately with salt 
and pepper, add a beaten egg, and if 
the pulp is dry add a tablespoon of cream 
to each cup of pulp. Wash and wipe 
a dozen tomatoes, cut a slice from the 
stem end and with a teaspoon remove 
the greater portion of the pulp; dust 
lightly with pepper and salt and fill with

with butter and bake until tbe tomatoes 
are soft and of a rich, brown color. 
Eemove carefully to mounds of buttered 
toast and serve either as an entree or 
as the main dish at a simple family 
luncheon. 

Escalloped Tomato and Cheese 

Make a drawn butter sauce with two 
tablespoons each of butter and flour; 
cook with one cup of hot water and sea- 
son with salt and pepper. Put a layer 
of bread crumbs in a buttered baking 
dish, cover with bits of tomato, then a 
layer of crumbs followed by grated 
cheese; continue until the dish is full, 
having a generous sprinkling of grated 
cheese on top. Pour over the whole the 
hot sauce and bake in a moderate oven 
until brown. 

Corn Fritters 

To two cups of grated sweet com add 
one cup of flour sifted with one tea- 
spoon of baking powder, two teaspoons 
of salt and a quarter teaspoon of pa- 
prika; add also half a cup of finely 
chopped celery and the beaten yolks of 
two eggs. Mix thoroughly and then fold 
in the stiffly whipped whites of two eggs. 
Drop by spoonfuls into hot fat and 
slowly fry to a pale brown. The fat 
should be about half an inch in depth 
in the pan-deeper than is required for 
sauteing, but not deep enough to cover 
the fritters. 

Corn Souffle 

One can of com put into a chopping 
machine and ground very fine. Take 
three eggs and whip light, separately. 
Add one teaspoon of melted butter. Sea- 
son with pepper and salt. Stir in the 
yolks, beat, cut in the whites of the eggs 
and bake in quick oven. 

Baked Beans 

Soak one quart of beans over night 
in water to cover. In the morning cover 
with water to which one-half teaspoon 
of soda has been added. Boil slowly 
until the skins begin to burst and strain 
off the water. Place in a bean crock 
and cover the beans with liquid com- 
posed of two cups of hot water, one- 
qliarter cup of molasses, one-half tea- 
spoon of mustard and one-half teaspoon 
of salt, adding more hot water if neces-

sary. Half bury one-half pound of salt 
pork in the top of the beans and bake 
for eight or nine hours. 

Haricot Beans 

Put a pint of washed beans in a clean 
five-pound flour bag and let them lie all 
night in a saucepan containing two 
quarts of cold water. The next morning 
simmer over a slow fire three hours ; lift 
out the bag into a colander; untie the 
string and turn the beans into a frying 
pan with a tablespoon of butter, a gill 
of cream and a very little finely minced 
parsley; season to taste with salt and 
pepper and shake over the fire until hot. 

Tomatoes, Corn and Onions 

Butter plentifully a deep baking dish, 
and cover the bottom an inch deep with 
green corn cut from the cob. Season 
well with salt and pepper and butter, 
then put in a layer of tomatoes peeled 
and sliced. Season them likewise, then 
add a layer of sliced and soaked onions. 
Eepeat till the dish is full, letting 
onions come on top. Cover with an 
inverted plate, and bake until nearly 
done — say about an hour. Then take 
off the plate and cook fifteen minutes 
longer. Sugar added to the seasoning 
is to many minds an improvement. 

Hulled Corn 

Wash two quarts of shelled corn to re- 
move loose bits; then place in a large 
iron kettle with four tablespoons of 
saleratuSj cover with cold water, let 
come to a boil slowly and cook about an 
hour. Eemove the kettle from fire, drain 
off the water, then pour the corn, from 
which the hulls will already be loosened, 
into a large pan of water. Eub the corn 
between the hands to loosen the hulls; 
after taking off all those partly loosened 
put it on again in warm water, let boil 
about half an hour, then try, to remove 
the rest of the hulls by rubbing as before. 
After all hulls are removed, wash the 
com in at least half a dozen clean waters, 
then put on once more in warm water, 
and when it boils drain and add fresh 
water. Let the com cook in this last 
■Water until tender, salting to taste. If 
the hulls do not come off readily let the 
corn boil an hour longer, adding a tea- 
spoon more saleratus. This will keep for 
several weeks without sealing in warm 
weather.

Baked Com and Beans 

It is an old dSsh with us, yet I find 
few who have heard of it. It is in no 
sense succotash. In sweet corn time pre- 
pare a pot of Boston baked beans in the 
usual way. About half an hour before 
they are to be served take from the oven, 
remove the pork and thoroughly stir in

from, the cob, then replace in the oven. 
Use plenty of corn. Canned corn may be 
used. 

Baked Beans Without Pork 

Soak one quart of medium pea beans 
over night or twelve hours, then parboil 
tin the skin cracks when taken up on 
a spoon and exposed to the cool air. Put 
a beef bone with marrow into the pot 
and fill with beans, adding two teaspoons 
of salt, and water to cover. Bake slowly 
for twelve hours, adding more water as 
it evaporates. Before serving take off 
the hard beans on top. 

CaHbage Souffle 

Shred coarsely a solid, well blanched 
head of cabbage and cook in an abun- 
dance of salted water until tender. Drain

between. To two tablespoons each of 
butter and flour, add a cup of rich milk, 
two beaten egg yolks and a saltspoon 
each of salt and mustard, stirring over 
the fire until it boils; then add the 
beaten whites of the eggs. Pour this 
over the cabbage and bake half an hour. 

Gabhage with Ham 

Melt a tablespoon of butter, and when 
hot turn in three pints of white cabbage 
shaved fine. Cover tightly and simmer

bage turns yellow. Sprinkle with a tea- 
spoon of salt, a few grains of cayenne, 
and a cup of minced cold boiled ham. 
Add one-fourth cup of white wine vin- 
egar, stir well, cover and cook slowly for 
two hours. 

Cauliflower Fritters 

Separate cold, cooked cauliflower into

small boiled potatoes (cold), one quarter 
pound of bacon, two onions, a small 
piece of bacon (for frying), parsley, 
French dressing (oil, vinegar, pepper,

For every four hearts add one hard- 
cooked egg, which is also chopped, and

thick mayonnaise dressing for each 
heart and mix well. Put this in the

Salad Verte 

The ingredients are olive oil, cider 
vinegar, tarragon vinegar, chives, cher- 
vil, and romaine or Boston lettuce, 
(Chervil can be bought at a seed dealer's 
for five cents a package and can be 
easily grown in a sunny window or in a 
garden. Chives cost fifteen cents a 
climip and spring up quickly after cut- 
ting.) In the first place, let the oil be 
above reproach — thick, yellow and rich. 
Use three tablespoons of oil to one of 
vinegar. Mix a saltspoon of salt and 
one of black pepper with the vinegar, 
pour in the oil slowly, mixing thoroughly 
until creamy, repeat this until oil and 
vinegar are thoroughly mixed and used 
up. In the last spoonful pour a few 
drops of tarragon vinegar and mix a 
tablespoon of finely chopped chives and 
another of chervil. I mix this and serve 
in little Japanese bowls, passing the 
romaine, which is by far the best salad 
to eat with French dressing, on a shallow 
dish, letting the guests dip the tender 
green into the dressing. Cheese crack- 
ers are the proper accompaniment to this 
salad — ^thin crackers spread with butter, 
grated yellow cheese, generously sea- 
soned with paprika, black pepper and 
salt, toasted in the oven long enough to 
crisp and puff up.

Timbdle Cases 

Into a small bowl put three-fourths of 
a cup of flour, half a teaspoon of salt 
and a teaspoon of sugar. Add gradually 
one-half cup of milk, one beaten egg and 
a tablespoon of olive oil. Whip with an 
egg-beater until it is perfectly blended, 
then chill for an hour. The frying is the 
most difficult part of the operation. 
Pour the batter into a deep cup; in a 
shallow bowl it would soon be too low 
to properly cover the timbale iron. Heat 
the fat until hot enough to brown bread 
in forty counts and provide a pan with 
heavy absorbent paper close by. Drop 
the mold end of the iron into the fat 
long enough to become heated, remove 
and dip into the batter for a second. 
A thin film of partially cooked batter 
will cling, but to insure a good timbale 
dip again. This time no bubble or hole 
should mar the even coat on the iron. 
jDip for twelve seconds in the hot fat. 
Turn the iron upside down to drain off 
the fat and to keep the timbale from 
dropping off. Slip from the iron to the 
paper and dip again. For success the 
fat must be very hot, and the iron must 
be hot as well ; dip the point into batter ; 
if nothing clings it is too cold or too 
hot. Dip into batter, covering half the 
mold. When fried these will be just the 
right hight. A fluted iron is easier for 
a beginner to use as there is no tendency 
for the fried timbale to slip off. See 
illustrations on pages 16 and 17.

beaten yolks of three eggs, then fold in 
the whites of the eggs beaten until stiff. 
Turn into buttered individual timbale 
shells or china cups and bake in a moder- 
ate oven until the egg is set. Serve at

chop the hard part, then add all to the 
batter, which should be quite thick. 
Drop by small spoonfuls in hot fat. 
Drain and serve as oyster fritters. 

Croquettes 

In making croquettes, use bread 
crumbs if possible, rolled or ground to 
the fineness of powder. Place them in 
an even oblong in the center of a board. 
Dilute one slightly beaten egg with twice 
the amount of cold water and place in a 
pie plate. Form the croquettes, roll in 
the crumbs, then in egg; crumbs again 
and set aside to fry. 

A mixtur,e of one-third clarified suet 
to two-thirds of good lard is excellent for 
frying. Olive oil is even better but of 
course more expensive. Whatever fat 
be used heat until a bit of bread can be 
browned in it in forty counts. Dip the 
empty frying basket in the hot fat, then 
fill with the croquettes, taking care that 
there are not enough to touch each other 
or the sides of the basket. When cooked 
drain on crushed unglazed paper. Heat 
the fat before attempting to fry a second 
batch. See illustrations on pages 18, 19 
and 20.

sage. Mix thoroughly and spread on 
top of the onion in the dish. Bake in 
a moderate oven twenty minutes. 

Steak with Tomato 

This is a good way of cooking a cheap 
cut of steak. It is nicest cooked in a 
casserole in the oven, but, as that is very 
expensive when one has a gas stove, we 
do it usually in a tightly covered frying 
pan on top of the stove. One pound 
round steak, three-quarters can tomato, 
one small onion, salt, red and black 
pepper to taste, one-half hay leaf. Put 
all together in a frying pan or casserole 
and cook slowly three hours. Cooking 
fast absolutely spoils it.

them in a big mixing bowL Add one 
pound of raisins, stoned, slightly chopped 
and floured, then half a pound of brown 
sugar, one pound of finely chopped suet, 
four ounces of chopped citron, four 
ounces of chopped lemon peel, four 
ounces of chopped orange peel, one tea- 
spoon of salt, one grated nutmeg, one 
teaspoon of ginger, one teaspoon of cin- 
namon, half a teaspoon of cloves, half a 
teaspoon of allspice and four ounces of 
split blanched almonds, one and a half 
pounds of flour and one and a half pounds 
of stale bread crumbs. Toss these dry in- 
gredients thoroughly, then add eight well 
beaten eggs, and milk enough to make a 
very stiff batter. One secret of success 
is that the batter be very well stirred. 
Take a square piece of strong drilling, 
dip it in boiling water, then rub it on 
one side full of flour. This forms a 
crust on the cloth which the water or 
steam cannot soak through. On the 
floured side lay an enameled bowl well 
buttered. Turn the pudding into this 
and cover with buttered paper. Gather 
the cloth together loosely, allowing one- 
quarter of space for the pudding to swell, 
set the pudding on a trivet in a kettle 
of boiling water, having the water come 
only half way up the side of the bowl, as 
the pudding should be steamed, not 
boiled. Let the water boil for six hours, 
keeping it replenished from the teaket- 
tle ; if it stops boiling for one minute the 
pudding will be sticky. See illustration 
on page 21.

and cut them in small pieces. Spread 
one cup of these on a platter and sprin- 
kle with lemon juice. Prepare two cups 
of sweetened whipped cream, fold in the 
stiffly^ whipped whites of two eggs and 
stir in carefully the pieces of date. 
Pile lightly in a glass dish, keep very 
cold until time to serve, and serve with 
it a delicate nut cake. 

Apple Compote and Orange Marmalade 

Boil one dozen tart apples in one quart

Ices and Frozen Desserts 



Ices are merely fruit juices diluted 
with water, and sweetened. Sherbets and 
punches imply the use of alcoholic liquor 
and spices, though the former is now 
commonly omitted. Ices, sorbets and 
punches are frozen to a soft, smooth 
mush and usually served in the middle 
of the dinner before the game and salad 
courses. 

Sherbets are punches or ices to which 
white of egg or gelatine is added and 
the freezing continued until smooth and 
stiff. Frappes and granites, as their 
names imply, are frozen to a granular 
mush with equal measures of salt and 
ice. 

Ice creams may be of two kinds. So- 
called Philadelphia ice, cream is merely 
a thin cream sweetened and flavored. 
Plain ice cream has a custard foundation 
to which cream, sugar and flavorings 
are added. In making a fruit ice cream, 
freeze the cream first to a soft mush, 
then open the freezer, beat in the desired 
fruit and continue freezing. 

Mousses are mixtures of whipped 
cream, custard and gelatine which are 
frozen without beating or use of the 
dasher. They are usually packed in 
molds and are always buried in equal 
measures of salt and ice. 

All mixtures depend for their freezing 
on a simple principle. Salt dissolves read- 
ily in water. The ice in melting to allow 
of this solution, loses its latent heat and 
the temperature of the resulting brine 
is much lower than that of the ice itself. 
Therefore it is the brine which is valua- 
ble, and the finer the ice is cracked the 
easier is the process of solution. Do not 
pour off the brine before the freezing is 
completed. 

Provide a strong burlap or water proof 
bag and a heavy wooden mallet. Ice may 
be crushed to a fine powder with these. 
One cup of coarse rock salt to three cupa 
of finely crushed ice is the best propor- 
tion for ordinary freezing. ITse a layer 
of ice first, then pack in the foregoing 
proportion, turning the freezer crank oc- 
casionally to shake and pack down the 
mixture. Turn slowly, especiallyat first, 
as a soft velvety cream depends in great 
measure upon this. After freezing, if

the cream is to ripen, pour off the brine 
and repadc with the ice and salt this 
time in the proportion of one cup of 
salt to four cups of ice. 

In molding creams or ices, if for large 
molds, freeze rather soft; individual 
molds need a stiffly frozen mixture. Ohill 
the mold thoroughly and pack solidly 
until it overflows. Cover with a but- 
tered paper, press the cover down, bind 
tightly with a narrow strip of buttered 
cloth and pack deep in equal measures 
of ice and salt. Four or five hours wiU 
be needed. Molds which are divided in 
halves should have each half packed sol- 
idly; omit the buttered paper, but be sure 
the mold is full to overflowing, bind with 
the strip of buttered cloth and pack as 
usual. 

Apple Sherbet 

Boil one quart of apples in a pint of 
water until soft. Mash through a sieve. 
Add the juice of one orange and one 
lemon, one-half pound sugar and a quart 
more of water. Beat well and freeze. 
When of the consistency of snow, add 
the beaten white of one egg and finish 
freezing. 

Ginger Ice 

Boil one quart of water with two cups 
of sugar for twenty minutes, add one- 
half pin]b of lemon juice, one-half cup 
of chopped preserved ginger, and one- 
half cup of ginger syrup. Strain and 
when cold freeze as usuaL 

Lemon Sherbet 

Juice of two lemons, one pint of 
sugar. Let stand a while ; add one quart 
of milk and freeze. 

Orange Ice 

Put one pint of water and one and 
one-half cups of sugar on to boil; chip 
the yellow rind of three oranges, add to 
the syrup, boil five minutes, and stand 
away to cool. Peel eight nice, juicy 
oranges and one lemon, cut them in 
halves, take out the seeds and squeeze 
out all the juice; mix with the syrup, 
strain through a cloth and freeze. 

Frozen Strawberry Mousse 

Whip one pint of sweet double cream 
until thick. Fold in two cups of pow- 
dered sugar, one-half cup of finely 
chopped blanched almonds and one quart

of strawberries slightly crushed. Turn 
into a pudding mold having a tube in 
the center. Pack in ice and salt, cover 
with a heavy blanket or piece of carpet, 
and let stand in a cool place for three 
or four hours. When ready to serve, 
turn out carefully, and fill the hollow 
center with sweetened berries mixed with 
whipped cream. 

Gooseberry Ice 

Stew one quart of ripe gooseberries in 
a very little water until soft, then press 
through a fine sieve. Flavor with lemon 
juice, and to every pint of- the goose- 
berry juice allow one pound of loaf 
sugar. Stir over the fire until the sugar 
is dissolved, then cool, and freeze. 

Prune Sherbet 

Boil one pound of prunes in one cup of 
water until very tender, strain through 
a fine colander, adding a pint of sugar, 
the juice of one lemon and half a cup 
of maple syrup; return to the fire and 
stir constantly to prevent burning, boil- 
ing ten minutes. Remove, and when 
thoroughly cold add the stiffly whipped 
whites of two eggs ; turn into the freezer, 
and when half frozen stir in a small 
cup of chopped hickory nuts. Serve in 
small sherbet cups, with a tablespoon of 
whipped cream on each portion. 

Grape Fruit Sorbet 

EoU and press, then cut in half, ex- 
tract the meat and juice, and free from 
every seed. Squeeze out all the juice 
into a deep bowl, and allow one pound of 
sugar to every pint of juice (err on the 
side of too much, rather than not 
enough sugar). Stir thoroughly and 
pour into the freezer. Freeze like 
mousse, that is, "mossy," but not firm 
like ice cream. 

Cocoanut Ice 

Boil one-half pound of sugar and one 
pint of water together for five minutes, 
add one-half pint of cocoanut milk to 
the sjrup, let it come to a boil once, 
then cool and freeze. This will serve 
five persons. To obtain a cocoanut with 
the requisite amount of milk, one must 
insist upon having a nut with the eyes 
on the surface. As the nuts age, they 
dry, shrinking in the process, and the 
eyes grow deeper. A reasonably fresh 
specimen should furnish a trifle more 



K&MOBANDA 217 



220 ICES AND FBOZEir DES8EBTS 

than a half pint of milk and the easiest 
way of extracting it is to drive a nail 
through the eyes, letting the milk drip 
through these holes into a bowl. The 
meat is thus left intact and ready for 
other uses. 

Tomato Sherbet 

SiTTiTner together for twenty minutes 
one quart of chopped tomato, one pint 
of water, the juice of two lemons and 
the grated rind of one, two cups of 
sugar and half a teaspoon of ground 
ginger. When sufioiently cooked pass 
through a sieve, add four ounces of 
crystallized cherries and two cups of 
freshly grated apple. Freeze as usual, 
adding when nearly frozen one glass 
of Maraschino and the stifly whipped 
whites of two eggs. 

Frozen Peaches 

. Dissolve two cups of granulated sugar 
in the juice from one can of peaches. 
Mash the peaches fine, place in freezer, 
add the juice, and finally the well-beaten 
whites of three eggs. Freeze as usual. 
This will serve ten pers<»s. 

Grape Sherbet 

Boil one pint of water, one-half poimd 
of sugar and a teaspoon of chopped 
lemon rind five minutes. Strain and 
when cool add the juice of one lemon, 
one-half pint of grape juice and the 
white of an egg. When cold, freeze. 
Serve in frappe glasses. 

Watermelon Sherbet 

Eemove the edible pulp from an ice 
cold watermelon and rub through a 
fruit sieve, adding three tablespoons of 
red currant juice, a scant cup of con- 
fectioner's sugar and a tablespoon of 
gelatine that has been softened, then 
dissolved in a cup of warm water; turn 
into the, freezer and when half frozen 
stir in a cup of meringue made by 
blending the whites of two eggs with 
four tablespoons of sugar. Freeze to the 
consistency of mush and serve in slender 
crystal sherbet glasses, sprinkled with 
minced candied orange peel. 

Frozen Turkish Coffee

creamy, add a pint of stiffly whipped 
cream, a tablespoon of confectioner's 
sugar, a pinch of powdered cinnamon, 
a few drops of vanilla and about a tea- 
spoon of coffee extract. Freeze as usual ; 
serve in small crystal cups, garnishing 
each with a star of whipped cream flav- 
ored with almond extract. 

Apricot Ice in Jelly Cups 

Mix one pint of apricot pulp, the juice 
of two oranges and one lemon, the 
grated rind of the lemon and one pint 
of syrup (made by cooking for ten 
minutes two cups of sugar and one cup 
of water). Freeze in the usual way. 

For the jelly cups, make a lemon jelly 
by softening one ounce of gelatine in 
one-third of a cup of cold water, add a 
pint of boiling water, stir until dis- 
solved. Add a cup of sugar, and when 
cool the grated rind of a lemon and the 
juice of four. Stir in enough spinach 
green to give a pretty green tint. Mold 
in little border molds or patent charlotte 
russe molds. When firm turn out and 
fill the hollow centers with the ice, 
which may be topped with a spoonful of 
whipped cream or sprinkled with candied 
mint leaves. 

Mexican^- Ice Cream 

Put a cup of granulated sugar into 
a smooth saucepan over the fire and stir 
constantly until it is melted, add a cup 
of English walnut meats and pour into 
a shallow buttered pan to harden. When 
perfectly cold grate or chop fine. 
Crumble twelve macaroons into fine 
crumbs, then toast in the oven a few 
moments. Make a custard of the yolks 
of two eggs, a fourth of a cup of sugar 
and a cup of milk, then pour over the 
stiffly beaten whites of two eggs and let 
cool. To a pint of cream add a third of 
a cup of sugar and beat until thoroughly 
mixed, add the custard and flavor with 
vanilla or Maraschino, then freeze. 
When half frozen, add the macaroon 
crumbs and half of the grated walnut 
mixture and finish freezing. Sprinkle 
the remaining grated walnuts over the 
cream at serving time.

Pastry 



Puif Paste 

First, in the preparation of puff paste, 
choose a cool corner to work in and if 
possible, have plenty of cracked ice at 
hand. Weigh one-half pound of pastry 
flour and one-half pound of butter. 
Waih the latter in a bowl of ice water as 
in the illustration. Wash and knead 
until not a drop of water is left in the 
butter and it is smooth and waxy. 

Now pat it into a round one-half inch 
thick, and place on ice. Work one table- 
spoon of butter into the flour and mix 
enough ice water with it to make a stiff 
dough, then knead on a floured board one 
minute. Cover with a clean cloth, and 
let it stand five minutes. Next roll the 
dough into an oblong sheet one-fourth 
. inch thick and be careful to have the 
corners square. Pat into shape if neces- 
sary; put the butter on this and fold the 
free end over, striking lightly each edge 
to imprison the air. Fold the right side 
over, the left under the inclosed butter, 
swing the paste half around, cover and 
wait five minutes. Now roll with light, 
even strokes into the oblong sheet, fold 
from the ends toward the center, form- 
ing three laps. Again cover and leave 
five minutes. Eepeat the same process 
twice; renaember to keep a square-cor- 
nered rectangle of paste; do not neglect 
the chilling or think three instead of five 
minutes long enough to wait. 

For the last time roll, but fold in four 
layers, like a pocketbook. Place on ice 
and chill through bef qre cutting. Shape 
with fluted or plain cutters into tarts 
and patty shells. Again chill and bake 
twenty-five to thirty minutes in a very 
hot oven. From the left-overs cut tiny 
buttons one-half inch in diameter to serve 
with clear soups. EoU out all the rem- 
nants into a thin sheet, grate hard cheese 
over this and cut in narrow strips three 
inches long. These are delicious with 
any soup. Serve in the shells shaved 
celery, stewed in cream and seasoned 
with pepper, salt and shredded olives, a 
newburg or a shrimp wiggle ; in fact, use 
any of the creamed entrees with your 
pastry. To vary a rabbit, fill the patties 
with hot apple sauce, then cover with 
the rabbit. See illustration on Page 23.

Plain Pie Crust 

Place in a chopping bowl one and one- 
haK cups of flour, one-quarter cup of 
butter, one-quarter cup of lard, one tea- 
spoon of salt. With a sharp chopping 
knife, chop the shortening thoroughly 
through the flour, after which add just 
enough ice water to hold the mixture 
together (from one-quarter to one-half 
cup is sufficient), chopping all the time 
until a smooth dough is formed, which 
should be allowed to stand in a cold place 
for a day at least before using. 

Shaker Pastry 

Mix one quart of flour, one teaspoon of 
salt, one cup of fresh beef drippings, and 
one cup of cream, add water enough to 
make a dough. Eoll out a bit of this 
mixture, spread with soft butter, sprinkle 
with flour, and roll up like jelly cake, cut 
off a portion, stand on end, heap on flour 
and roll out. This makes the flakes of 
the top crust. The lower crust is rolled 
out from the plain mixture. 

Shaher Apple Pie 

Put into the lower crust sour apples, 
pared, cored and cut into eighths; add a 
generous half pint of seeded raisins and 
put on the top crust. Cut it around the 
plate, being careful not to let it stick to 
the lower crust. Bake in a slow oven till 
the apple is thoroughly cooked and the 
crust is a nice brown, both top and bot- 
tom; this requires about forty minutes. 
While it is still hot take off the top crust 
and lay it carefully aside, then with a 
wooden knife stir the apple, removing 
the hard pieces, if any are left. Add 
sugar, cinnamon or nutmeg to taste, 
and a small piece of butter. Replace the 
top crust. Tin plates are best for the 
baking of these pies, but they should 
never be put away on the same plates in 
which they are baked. 

Maple Custard Pie 

Beat two eggs and a third of a cup of 
grated maple sugar, add a level table- 
spoon of flour and gradually two cups 
of milk. Turn into a deep pastry lined 
pan, dust slightly with cinnamon or nut- 
meg, and bake in a quick oven at first, to 
set the crust, then lower the tempera- 
ture.

A New Mince Pie 

The new thing about this pie is the 
filling, which has a different flavor from 
the ordinary kind because the meat in 
the mince is not twice cooked. Take 
one cup of raw beef chopped fine— this 
must be free from gristle and fat — ^mix 
it with three cups of tart apples, chopped 
fine. Add one cup of currant jelly, 
juice and grated rind of two oranges and 
one lem^on, one cup of sugar, one tea-

allspice, and half a teaspoon of pepper 
and nutmeg. Make soft and moist with 
sweet cider, and add plenty of raisins, 
currants, citron and candied orange peel, 
and a very little chopped suet, if you 
like suet. This will make three pies, 
and if the three pies are not all made 
at once, the remainder of the mince 
should be canned for future use. For 
a winter novelty, make patties of this 
mince meat, cover with a lattice crust, 
and, when ready to serve, pour a table- 
spoon of brandy over each tiny pie, light 
it, and place it before each guest. Mince 
pie should always be served warm.

Christmas Tarts 

The foundation for these pastry tid- 
bits is usually puff paste, but the foUow- 
ingr simpler paste may be used: Mix 
and sift together two cups of flour, two 
teaspoons of baking powder and a salt- 
spoon of salt. Work in a cup of butter 
with the tips of the fingers. When the 
mixture is as fine as meal, stand it 
aside an hour or more to chill. Then 
take out half a cup and to the remainder 
add cold water gradually to make a stiff 
dough. Knead slightly, turn on a floured 
board and roll into a long, narrow strip. 
Sprinkle the dough with half of the 
reserved mixture and fold so as to make 
three layers. Turn half way round with 
the open end toward you, roll again 
into a strip, sprinkle with the remain- 
ing mixture and fold as before. Eoll 
and fold twice more, and the pastry is 
ready to use. Eoll into a thin sheet 
and cut into various shapes, as hearts, 
circles, strips and diamonds. See page

Cakes and Cookies 

Use only the beat of material in cake 
makins. Cooking butter will not make 
good cake. Coarse granulated sugar 
makes a heavy cake. Use a fine granu- 
lated. Pastry flour contains less of the 
sticky gluten than bread flour and there- 
fore is better where baking powder is 
used for leavening. Should it be neces- 
sary to use bread flour, two tablespoons 
less for each cup will be needed. 

Measure all ingredients, slightly warm 
the flour, if chilled, butter the cake pans, 
have all needed utensils at hand, and see 
that the fire is in good condition, coal 
must not be added while cake is baking, 
before beginning the actual mixing. 

Sponge cakes which depend for their 
raising on the amount of air beaten into 
the batter need a long slow cooking in 
a moderate oven; butter cakes on the 
contrary require a hot oven, slightly 
cooled the last quarter. Cake may be 
looked at while in the oven if the door 
be opened so gently that no current of 
air be forced into the oven ; do not move, 
however, until risen to the full hight of 
the loaf. If the oven is too hot place a 
pan filled with cold water in the oven.

ping; flavor to taste. Sift, measure and 
set aside flour and sugar; separate the 
eggs, putting the whites in the mixing 
bowl and the yolks in a small bowl; beat 
yolks to a very stifE froth; whip whites 
to foam, add cream of tartar, and whip 
until very stiff; add sugar to the whites

Sandwiches and Canapes 

Fairy 8andwiche» 

Cut an equal number of thin slices 
of brown and white bread, and butter 
them with the following mixture : Beat 
three ounces of fresh butter to a cream 
with four ounces of powdered sugar, 
beating it well together for some little 
time ; then beat in a tablespoon of lemon 
juice. Set it on ice for an hour. After 
haying spread this mixture on the bread, 
sprinkle thinly with blanched and 
chopped nuts of any kind. Press the 
white slices to the brown, and stamp out 
in circles or triangles. 

Olive Sandwiches 

Stone and mince olives, seasoning 
them with white pepper; then pound 
them to a smooth paste. Cut some thin 
slices of bread and butter, and spread 
half with the pounded olives and the 
other half rather thickly with finely 
chopped tongue. Press the two halves 
together lightly. 

Egg Sandwiches 

Take six hard-cooked eggs, six washed 
and boned anchovies, a teaspoon of 
Prench mustard and a tablespoon each 
of oil and cream; pound this all to a 
smooth paste, seasoning it with salt and 
cayenne to taste. Spread this mixture 
thickly on thin slices of buttered bread. 

Pepper Sandwiches 

Chop finely green bell peppers, mix 
with a few chopped olives and mayon- 
naise to make a paste. Spread between 
slices of bread cut very thin. 

Date Sandwiches 

Mij equal amounts of date pulp and 
finely chopped English walnut meats. 
Moisten slightly with a little sweet 
cream or soft butter, spread the mixture 
smoothly on thinly sliced whole wheat 
bread, cover with another slice, and 
press lightly to make them hold together. 
Another pleasing date sandwich is made 
by first spreading the bread, lightly but- 
tered, with a layer of cottage cheese 
moistened with a little cream; over this 
place a layer of the chopped dates, and

268 SANDWICHES AND CANAPES 

cover with another slice of buttered 
bread. A richer sandwich filling may be 
made by using with the dates chopped 
preserved ginger instead of the cheese or 
walnuts, and moistening with a little 
ginger syrup. Equal quantities of 
chopped dates and figs or raisins mixed 
with a little white icing make another 
pleasing variety. 

Tea Sandwiches 

For afternoon tea try- orange marma- 
lade, pecan nuts and cream cheese mixed 
thoroughly, and spread between thin 
slices of white bread slightly buttered. 
These should be made into long, narrow 
sandwiches. Also, make baking powder 
biscuit the size of half a dollar, and when 
cold split them and spread them with a 
mayonnaise mixed with minced celery 
and stuffed olives. 

Walnut Sandwiches 

An appetizing filling for sandwiches is 
made by mixing equal parts of grated 
Swiss cheese and chopped English wal- 
nut meats with sufficient softened but- 
ter to form a paste. Season with salt 
and cayenne as needed. 

Pecan Nut Sandwiches 

Eub to a smooth paste one tablespoon 
of butter, two tablespoons of grated 
cheese, a saltspoon each of salt, paprika, 
dry mustard and celery salt, a little an- 
chovy paste and a teaspoon of vinegar. 
When very smooth add a cup of pecan 
nuts that have been passed through the 
meat chopper. Spread this between thin 
slices of buttered graham breaxl. 

Fried Sandwiches with Ham 

Butter slices of stale crustless bread 
and spread between them, sandwich 
fashion, chopped ham, which has been 
moistened with a little cream. Press 
two slices together firmly and soak for 
a minute in half a cup of milk to which 
a beaten egg has been added. Dip on 
each side, then fry in butter in a hot 
spider, turning the sandwiches to brown 
them well. 

Tongue Sandwiches 

Smoked tongue makes delicious sand- 
wiches, if sliced very thinly and put 
between pieces of buttered rye or white 
bread. Mustard may be used with them, 
if liked.

Celery Sandwiches 

Butter th» bread on the loaf, having 
first creamed the butter. Cut off the 
crusts, and beginning at one comer of the 
slice, roll it tightly over two sticks of 
crisp celery. The butter will hold it to- 
gether. The celery should be broken into 
thin strips about the size of the smallest 
stalks toward the leaf end, and also cut 
an appropriate length. 

Baked Bean Sandwiches 

Butter thin slices of bread from which 
the crusts have been removed. Rub one 
cup of cold baked beans through a strainer 
or press them through a fine sieve. Sea- 
son these to taste, using a bit of onion 
juice, a teaspoon of chopped parsley, the 
same of chopped celery, and a very Httle 
prepared mustard. Spread this upon the 
bread, and roll, or cut into fancy shapes. 

Salmon Sandwiches 

Spread four rather thick slices of bread 
with cream cheese and salmon chopped up 
fine, putting the cheese on both sides of 
the salmon, to make the slices stick to- 
gether. Pile them up, making a cube, 
with bread top and bottom, and press to- 
gether firmly; wrap in a damp cloth and 
put in the cold until time to serve; then 
trim off the crusts and slice the cubes 
into dainty sandwiches, which look like 
layer cake. 

Flower or Fruit Butter 

Wrap new, fresh butter in paraffin 
paper. Place a thick layer of the desired 
blooms or leaves in the bottom of a bowl, 
put the butter on top of this, then cover 
thickly with more leaves. Cover the 
bowl as tightly as possible and set away 
in a cool room for at least three hours. 
The result will be faintly suggestive of 
the blossoms. 

Fairy Butter 

Mix thoroughly three hard cooked eggs 
with two tablespoons of sugar, beat into 
this four tablespoons of fresh butter and 
flavor to taste with almond paste. 

Parsley Butter 

Add one teaspoon of salt, a speck of 
pepper and a tablespoon of finely minced 
parsley, to half a cup of fresh butter. 
Cream together and gradually beat into 
this a tablespoon of lemon juice.

Salmon Canapes 

Cut slices of bread in fingers one-half 
inch thick, fry in olive oil until light 
brown. When cold butter and cover 
with thin slices of smoked salmon. 

Plotted Cheese 

Pound one pound of cheese in a mor- 
tar with two ounces of liquid butter, one 
glass of sherry or brandy, cayenne pep- 
per, mace and salt. Beat all well to- 
gether and put into a small jar, with a 
layer of butter on top. 

Cral Appetizer-

the shredded meat from six boiled crabs, 
and when warmed through add three 
tablespoons of butter, salt, cayenne pep- 
per to taste and two tablespoons of 
grated Italian cheese and the beaten 
yolk of one egg. Heat thoroughly, and 
place on squares of buttered toast. 
Place them in a pan and run into the 
oven for a few minutes, then serve each 
on a white lettuce leaf. 

Hichory Nut Canapes 

Cut bread into slices one-quarter of 
an inch thick, then with a small biscuit 
cutter stamp into meat circles; fry them 
in hot fat or saute in butter until they 
are golden brown. Pound in a mortar a 
pint of shelled hickory nut meats, moisten 
with a little sweet cream and season with 
salt and cayenne; when reduced to a 
thick paste, spread on the prepared 
bread, dust thickly with grated Parme- 
san cheese and cook in a quick oven until 
crisp and brown.

Sam Canapes 

Take one cup of chopped ham, two 
tablespoons of cream, a dash of cayenne 
and two tablespoons of grated cheese, 
and mix thoroughly. Shape rounds of 
white bread with a cooky cutter, fry 
them lightly in butter, spread with the 
ham mixture, sift grated cheese over the 
top, brown lightly in a hot oven and gar- 
nish each one with a stuffed olive. 

Deviled Cheese 

One quarter pound jar of Roquefort 
cheese, one-half pound Philadelphia 
cream cheese (or Neufchatel), two table- 
spoons of tomato ketchup, one teaspoon 
of Worcestershire sauce, one-haK tea- 
spoon of paprika, one-half teaspoon of 
salt, eight or ten chives chopped fine. 
This should be thoroughly mixed and 
put in jars, where, in a cool place, it will 
keep indefinitely. Spread on saltines and 
you will find it one of the best things 
for luncheon or to "finish" a dinner that 
you know. 

A Bonne Bouche 

A tonne houche is simply a taste of 
something unusually good and especially 
unique. This one is made of hard cooked 
egg whites, olives, anchovies, or clams, 
or even mussels, mixed with a mayon- 
naise and served cold in cold patly shells, 
very small ones. As a garnish, minced 
parsley is mixed with the powdered yolks 
and sprinkled on top. 

Egg and Sardine Canapes 

Cut six hard-cooked eggs into halves, 
separate the whites and yolks, finely 
chop the whites and rub the yolla 
through a sieve. Eemove the bones 
and skin from a dozen sardines, add half 
the sifted yolks, mix to a paste with a 
little oil from the can and season to 
taste with salt, cayenne and lemon 
juice. Cut thin slices of bread into 
small rounds with a biscuit cutter and 
saute in fresh butter until a delicate 
brown on both sides. When cool, spread 
with the sardine paste, decorate about the 
edge with the chopped whites and in the 
center put a little of the sifted yolks. 

Oyster CocMails

Maple Sugar Sandwiches 

Force some maple sugar through a 
food chopper, mix it with one-fourth its 
quantity of chopped and delicately 
browned nut meats, then spread between 
thin slices of fresh buttered bread. 
Either brown, entire wheat or white 
bread may be used, or the lower layer of 
bread may be of one kind of bread and 
the upper layer of another. This is a 
dainty sandwich for afternoon teas.

Fruits and Preserving 

Canning 

It is essential that the fruit chosen 
should be fresh, perfectly sound, fine in 
flavor and of uniform ripeness. Over- 
ripe as well as underripe fruit has infe- 
rior flavor. 

Before beginning the actual work of 
cooking the fruit, have all the needed 
utensils close at hand in order and im- 
maculately clean. If much fruit is to 
be put up, it is better to do the pre- 
paratory work, such as bringing out 
needed kettles, examining and cleansing 
jars, and similar matter, the day before, 
80 ijaat early the following morning one 
may start in at the real work while still 
free from fatigue. 

Use only utensils that are not affected 
by the acid in the fruit, such as gran- 
ite, aluminum, silver or earthenware. 
Wide-mouthed self-sealing glass jars 
with glass or porcelain-lined covers are 
the best; tin especially should not be 
used. Pint jars are more convenient for 
small families. Examine aU jars to 
make sure there are no defects, that the 
covers fit perfectly, and that the rims are 
not bent, else they cannot be hermeti- 
cally sealed. Thoroughly clean and scald 
the jars and boil the covers to sterilize 
them. Use new rubbers each season, as 
they always deteriorate with usage or 
age. 

All fruit should be washed only suffi- 
ciently to thoroughly cleanse it, as too 
much washing impairs the flavor. To 
clean berries, currants and similar small 
fruits, pick over and carefully stem 
them, then put a few at a time into 
a colander, rinse by dipping it quickly 
several times in and out of a pan of 
clear, cold water and drain thorotighly. 
Change the water as often as needed. 
Cherries should be washed, then stemmed 
and seeded, in order to save all the juice. 
Wash plums and seed them; or, if the 
seeds are to be retained, prick each plum 
in several places with a large needle 
or a silver fork to prevent the skins 
from bursting. Peaches, pears and sim- 
ilar fruits should be pared with a silver 
knife, freed as desired from stones and 
cores, then covered with a dampened 
napkin until the moment of cooking, to 



MEMORANDA 277 



280 FRUITS AND PKESEEVING 

prevent discoloration. Sometimes, to 
add to their natural appearance, stems 
of pears are carefully scraped and left 
on the fruit. 

Pack the fruit as fast as it is prepared 
directly into the jars, as closely as possi- 
ble without mashing. Make a syrup, us- 
ing sugar according to taste, or in the 
proportion of two cups of sugar to one 
cup of water. Cool it sufficiently to 
avoid danger of breaking the jars, then 
pour over the fruit in the jars to within 
an inch of the top. This allows for ex- 
pansion in cooking. Screw on the covers, 
leaving off the rubber bands. Set the 
jars so they cannot touch each other — it 
is well to separate them with folds of old 
newspaper — in a wash boiler of lukewarm 
water, or water about the same tempera- 
ture as the jars. If only a few jars at 
a time are to be canned use a deep 
saucepan. Have the water cover the 
jars to about three-fourths of their 
hight. Stand the jars on a perforated 
board or on heavy folds of paper, so the 
water can circulate under as well as 
around them, and thus avoid the danger 
of breakage. Cover the vessel so the 
steam will increase the intensity of the 
heat, heat to the boiling point and boil 
steadily from fifteen to thirty minutes, 
according to the firmness of the fruit. 
Berries, cherries and plums should cook 
about fifteen minutes, peaches and pears 
from twenty to thirty minutes. Test by 
piercing with a fork, taking care not 
to cook until too soft. When done, lift 
out the jars one at a time, and run a 
silver knife that has been sterilized in 
boiling water around the inside of the 
jar to liberate the air, taking care not 
to mash the fruit. If the fruit falls 
some, fill again for sealing, using for 
this purpose boiling syrup, boiling water 
or the contents of another jar. The 
latter is really the preferable way, one 
jar usually sufficing to fill up three or 
four jars. 

Carefully^ dry the top of the jar, dip 
the rubber in and out of boiling water, 
dry and put firmly on the jar. Fill the 
jar to overflowing with the boiling syrup, 
then dry and screw on the cover, which 
meanwhile has been standing in boiling 
water. Let the rubber show an even edge 
all around, screw the cover as tightly as 
possible, turn the jar upside down for 
half a minute, and if any juice escapes 
open and seal over again immediately. 



KEM0BA17DA 279 



983 FRUITS AND FREBERVINa 

Stand the jars right side up in a place 
free from draft while cooling. As the 
glass contracts in cooling, the covers be- 
come loose, so it is necessary to screw 
them repeatedly. The next morning 
screw the covers tightly as possible for 
the last time, invert the jars on clean 
paper, and if there is no leakage, they 
are ready for storing. 

Strawberry Preserves 

Purchase large, choice, perfect berries, 
not over ripe. Remove lie stems care- 
fully, then wash and weigh the fruit. 
To wash without bruising, put about a 
quart of berries into the colander at a 
time, then dip quickly in and out of a 
deep pan of clear water several times, 
and drain thoroughly. For every pound 
of fruit measure three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar, then put the fruit and 
sugar in alternate layers into a large 
granite preserving kettle, not using over 
six pounds of fruit at a time. If too 
much is prepared at a time, the fruit is 
crushed by its own weight. Stand aside 
until the bottom of the kettle is covered 
with juice, then cover and heat very 
gradually to boiling. Boil gently for 
fifteen minutes and remove all scum. 
Do not stir unless really necessary as 
stirring breaks the fruit. Pour the 
cooked mixture into large platters or 
deep soup plates to the depth of about 
an inch and put on a table in the sunni- 
est spot in the yard, moving the table if 
need be, as the sun shifts position. 
Cover securely to protect against flying 
insects, using a double thickness of mos- 
quito netting. To prevent the netting 
from falling into the fruit, elevate it by 
putting fruit jars around the ends of the 
table, with one in the center, and tie 
securely over all, so nothing can crawl 
in from underneath. To guard against 
ants place the feet of the table in water. 
Late in the afternoon, about 5 o'clock, 
and before the dew commences to fall, 
bring the fruit indoors. Scrape the con- 
tents of the several plates into one large 
crock to obtain uniform consistency in 
the entire mass. The following morning 
pour into plates and proceed as before. 
Continue this process imtil the syrup_ it 
very thick and almost a jelly. Thres 
days usually are needed, but the time 
varies according to the intensity of the 
heat. Ample time must be given to in- 
sure perfect keeping. When done put

284 FRUITS AND PRESERVING 

the contents of the several plates into 
one dish as before, then turn without 
other cooking into small self-sealing 
glass jars. Pour melted paraffine over 
the top of the fruit, adjust rubbers and 
lids and, to guard against mold, tie 
a piece of cotton over the top of the 
jar. Wrap jars in dark paper, label and 
store as other fruit in a cool, dark, dry 
place. 

Of course bright, clear, hot, sunshiny 
days are essential for preserves of this 
kind and unless the weatiier is propitious 
it is folly to attempt it; but if the pre- 
serving has been commenced and rain 
follows before it is done, it may be kept 
for several days and then finished. If 
the weather remains unfavorable for a 
long period it is safer to finish the pre- 
serve by cooking it on the stove. Fruit 
prepared in this way retains in an un- 
usual degree its natural appearance and 
flavor and if carefully prepared and 
sealed will keep indefinitely. The 
method seems particularly well adapted 
for the early small fruits, the sun pos- 
sessing greater power at the season of 
their maturity. In the temperate cli- 
mate the heat is not sufficiently intense 
after the middle of July to keep the 
fruit. 

Currant Preserves 

Choose the large, cherry currants, 
wash and stem them. To a pound of 
fruit allow a pound of sugar, and pro- 
ceed according to directions for preserv- 
ing strawberries. Currants are particu- 
larly fine prepared in this way and are 
ivHij equal in excellence to the famous 
bar-le-duc currants, from which they can 
scarcely be distinguished. 

Fruit Tutti Frutti 

Put a pint of brandy into a thoroughly 
sweet three-gallon stone jar. Beginning 
with strawberries, the first fruit of the 
season, add in succession the various 
fruits as they appear in market, taking 
care to choose only those which are 
choice, firm and fresh. Add a pound 
of sugar to each pound of fruit until the 
jar is almost half full, then use three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit. Stir the mixture thor- 
oughly for several mornings after each 
addition of fruit and sugar to dissolve 
the sugar, using for this purpose a 
wooden or graniteware spoon and tak-

pineapple into suitable pieces for eating, 
seed the cherries, pare the apricots and 
peaches and cut into halves or quarter*,

Sweet Pickled Peaches 

Pare choice, firm peaches of fine 
flavor. Many prefer clingstones for this 
purpose, but as they need more manipu- 
lation at the table, freestones are recom- 
mended. If the former are used leave 
whole ; the latter should be cut in halves, 
stoned, and the kernels of at least a third 
added to the peaches. Weigh the pre- 
pared fruit and put it into a deep stone 
crock. To seven pounds of fruit allow 
four pounds of light brown sugar, a 
pint of pure cider vinegar of medium 
strength, an ounce of stick cinnamon, 
two tablespoons of whole allspice and 
two teaspoons of whole cloves. Tie the 
spices in a cheesecloth, boil with the 
sugar and vinegar for five minutes, skim 
well and pour boiling hot over the fruit. 
Cover securely and stand in a cool place 
over night. The next morning drain off 
the syrup, boil for ten minutes with the 
spice bag, skim and again pour boiling 
hot over the fruit. Continue this process 
for three successive mornings. The last 
morning add the fruit to the syrup and 
spices and boil gently imtil pierced easily 
with a fork, then skim out and put into 
the crock. Continue to boil the syrup 
until it is as thick as molasses. If, after 
the second boiling, it does not seem spiced 
sufficiently, add more spices tied in a 
fresh bag. When the syrup is done, re- 
heat the peaches in it. then fill into self- 
sealing glass jars as in canning. Al- 
though pickled fruit will keep in the 
crock if securely tied, it is decidedly 
preferable to seal it in jars. 

Cherries^ Plums and German Prunes 

These are delicious when sweet pic- 
kled. Pit cherries. Plums are usually 
stoned; the very large ones are some- 
times left whole. If left whole, prick 
with a silver fork to prevent the skins 
from bursting. Proceed exactly as in 
making peach sweet pickles. 

Spiced Currants 

Six pounds of currants, one level table- 
spoon of cinnamon, four pounds of sugar, 
one level teaspoon of cloves, two pounds 
of raisins, one level teaspoon of allspice, 
one cup of vinegar. Pick over the cur- 
rants, wash, drain and remove the stems.

Apple Jam 

None of the soft non-keeping apples 
are suitable for preserving; sound, tart 
baking apples are the proper ones to use. 
Pare the apples, cut diem in quar- 
ters, core carefully and slice rather 
thick; to every pound allow one pound 
of good brown sugar, and to every five 
pounds of apples allow the thinly cut 
rinds and juice of four lemons, and, 
according to taste, either a quarter or 
half a pound of young whole ginger, and 
one ounce of cloves. Let aU lie together 
in a bowl till next day, when they should 
be boiled until perfectly clear and until 
the apples are a rich amber color. Wind-

away all injured portions, make good 
jam after the above recipe.

tie down. This is particularly good for 
children. 

Gooseberry Marmalade 

Use three-fourths of a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Put the sugar and 
fruit in layers in a preserving kettle. 
Heat very slowly, and crush the fruit a 
little as it heats to extract the juice. 
Simmer very gently until it is a thick 
mass. It must be stirred frequently, and 
cooked until the skins are perfectly 
tender. Seal in tumblers like jelly.

Candies 



Fondant 

Boil two and one-fialf pounds of sugar 
and one-half teaspoon of cream of tar- 
tar with one and one-half cups of water 
until 242 F is registered on the candy 
thermometer. A less delicate test is that 
of the soft ball when tried in cold water. 

Cook in a kettle with a small surface 
and do not attempt to cook the syrup on 
a damp day. Wrap a clean piece of 
cheesecloth around a wooden spoon, dip 
in hot water and wash down the sides 
of the candy kettle. This prevents crys- 
tallizing and should be done often. 
When cooked, pour gently into a large 
oiled platter. Hold back the last quar- 
ter cup as it is apt to crystallize the 
whole. Cool without disturbing until 
only lukewarm, then beat with two silver 
knives until creamy. Pour into a stone 
jar, cover with waxed paper and a damp 
cloth and let it ripen forty-eight hours 
before using. Fondant properly cared 
for will keep indefinitely. 

Soft Ginger Chocolate Creams 

Form fondant into tiny cones, tuck> 
ing into each cone a bit of preserved 
ginger, well dried before using. Dip 
the balls into melted chocolate, one at 
a time, and lay on parafiSne paper in a 
cold place until hardened. 

Buttercups 

Boil one cup of water, two cups of 
granulated sugar and a teaspoon of 
lemon juice until it cracks in cold 
water. Color a pale yellow with vege- 
table coloring and pour on an oiled 
platter to cool. Mold a cup of fondant 
until creamy. EoU out a portion of the 
yellow can(^, making of it a long and 
narrow strip about an inch and a half 
wide. On tiiis lay a roll of the fondant 
as long as the candy and about half 
an inch in diameter. Wrap the candy 
around it, stretch all with the hands 
until quite small and cut in half-inch 
length. Any preferred flavorings can 
be used. A particularly pleasing com- 
bination is formed by flavoring the 
candy with orange extract and the fond- 
ant with banana.

294: CASDIES 

Plum Pudding Bonbons 

Into two cups of fondant slightly 
wanned mix, also slightly warmed and 
thoroughly dry, one tablespoon each of 
chopx>ed citron, chopped candied orange 
peel and seeded chopped raisins, two 
tablespoons of currants dredged with 
half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 
the grated rind of a lemon, and three 
tablespoons of chopped nut meats; use 
the hands rather than a spoon. Form 
into small balls, dip in unsweetened 
chocolate melted over hot water, and 
place on an oiled platter to harden. 

Opera Creams 

Melt together slowly three-fourths 
cup of milk, two cups of sugar and two 
squares of chocolate; then boU for three 
or four minutes, flavor and put in a 
cold place. The pan should not be 
touched for at least an hour or until it 
is absolutely cold. Then beat until it 
becomes resistant and creamy. Drop 
into round balls on paper. 

Maple and Butternut Cream 

Break into small pieces two pounds 
of "honest" maple sugar and heat in a 
porcelain or enameled saucepan with 
one pint of cream. Boil over a moder- 
ate fire to the soft ball stage. Remove 
from the fire, add one cup of chopped 
butternut meats and stir slowly until 
the mixture cools and begins to tiiicken, 
then pour into shallow buttered pans, 
score in squares and place a butternut 
meat on each square. 

Maple Candy 

Boil together for five minutes one cup 
of maple syrup and one cup of sugar; 
add one-quarter of a tea§poon of cream 
of tartar, two teaspoons of butter and 
two teaspoons of vinegar. After it has 
boiled until it is brittle when tried in 
cold water, pour it into buttered pans to 
cool. When cool enough to handle, pull 
it until it becomes hard, then out it in 
pieces and allow it to stand two or three 
days to become "ripened." 

Mexican Caramels 

Put a cup of granulated sugar into 
a clean iron skillet and stir constantly 
over a slow fire until the sugar is 
melted, taking care it does not brown. 
As soon as the sugar becomes a syrup 
add a cup of rich milk or cream, and 



MEMORANDA 293 



296 CANDIES 

stir constantly until the sugar is all 
dissolved. Add next a cup each of 
granulated and of light brown sugar and 
boil steadily until the mixture forms a 
soft ball when tested in cold water. 
Take from the fire, add a cup of 
coarsely chopped nut meats and stir to a 
creamy consistency. Pour into a shal- 
low pan lined with paraffiae paper, 
spread smoothly about half an inch in 
thickness and mark into squares while 
still warm. These caramels are per- 
fectly delicious, being both waxy and 
creamy. Any single kind or a mixture 
of several kinds of nut meats may be 
used. If there is any fondant at hand, 
pleasing variety is produced by filling 
the molds with a thin layer of the 
caramel and covering with a layer of 
melted fondant. 

Coffee Nut Caramels 

Place in a granite saucepan one cup 
of confectioner's sugar, half a cup of 
cream and a quarter of a cup of very 
strong coffee; stir constantly over a hot 
fire, until it reaches the hard ball stage, 
remove from the fire and stir in a cup 
of hickory meats. Turn out on an oiled 
slab or into a pan, having the paste half 
an inch thick, and mark into squares 
while warm. 

Marshmallev) Fudge 

Cook a cup of cream and two cups 
of powdered sugar (pulverized), stirring 
gently to avoid scorching, until the mix- 
ture begins to boil. Now add one-quar- 
ter pound of chocolate, stirring, as 
needed, until all is melted. The mix- 
ture should boil for perhaps ten minutes, 
a drop being tried in cold water until 
soft ball stage is reached. Add an inch 
and a half cube of butter, and stir until 
well mixed. Take the fudge from the 
flame, and beat briskly for five or ten 
minutes, then pour it in a buttered 
fudge pan containing a half pound of 
cut-up marshmallows and a quarter 
pound of chopped pecan meats scattered 
through. 

Chocolate Arabics 

Purchase the desired number of gum 
drops — either the jelly sort or "jaw- 
breakers" — and give them a coat of 
chocolate. To every ounce of unsweet- 
ened chocolate, melted, add two table-, 
spoons of milk, one or two tablespoons 



HEHORAKDA 297 



298 CANDIES 

of sugar and the least bit of butter. 
Stir over the fire till smooth and, while 
it is -warm, dip the drop into it with a 
fork or candy wire and place on a 
piece of marble. If the chocolate be- 
comes too stiff, thin cautiously with 
sugar syrup. The covering entirely 
changes the character of the gum drops, 
greatly improving their flavor. 

Peanut Brittle 

Shell, skin and chop fine one quart of 
peanuts or enough to make one cup of 
nut meats. Place one cup of sugar in a 
saucepan without water and heat grad- 
ually, stirring all the time, until the 
sugar is completely melted. Mix the 
peanuts in thoroughly, pour out on an 
inverted tin, unbuttered, then shape into 
a square with two broad knives. When 
the candy b^ins to hold its shape, mark 
it in small squares and continue to 
shape it and re-mark it until it hardens. 

Butter Scotch 

Two cups of light brown sugar, one 
cup of butter, one tablespoon of vinegar 
and one of water. Mix all together 
and boil twenty minutes. Add one- 
eighth of a tablespoon of baking soda, 
and as soon as it will crisp in cold 
water remove from the fire. When done 
pour out on a flat buttered tin and 
mark off in squares. 

Glace Walnuts 

Boil a cup of sugar, a few grains of 
cream of tartar and haK a cup of boiling 
water over a hot fire. Do not stir after 
the boiling has begun. Remove from 
the fire as soon as there is a suspicion 
of a faint yellow tinge to the syrup, dip 
the halved nuts separately into the 
syrup, then drop onto oiled paper. 
Stand the syrup in a pan of hot water 
to keep hot during dipping.

Chaf ing-Dish Redpcs 

Lobster Newburg 

This is the true Newburg as brought 
from Lorraine by a particularly capable 
chef. The materials are the meat from 
one lobster, cut into dice, the yolks of 
three eggs, one cup of cream, a wine- 
glass of sherry, a tablespoon of butter, 
a shake of cayenne pepper and a pinch 
of salt. Saute the lobster in butter, add- 
ing the sherry wine and using for this 
process the blazer. Beat the yolks of the 
eggs with the cup of cream, and add to 
the sauted lobster. Allow this to heat 
until it just begins to thicken, then 
take it oflf and serve. Never use flour 
or cornstarch for thickening. 

Sweetbreads Newburg 

Parboil, cool and cut into cubes suffi- 
cient sweetbread to make one and a half 
cups. Have ready also haK a cup of 
mushrooms, cooked and quartered. Heat 
a cup of cream in the blazer over hot 
water. Add the sweetbread and mush- 
rooms. Beat the yolks of three eggs, add 
a quarter of a teaspoon of salt, a few 
grains of cayenne and half a cup of 
sherry wine. Stir this gradually into 
the cream mi^ure and continue stirring 
until slightly thickened, then serve at 
once on toast or puff paste points. 

Turkey Newburg 

Melt one tablespoon of butter in a 
double boiler or chafing-dish, add one 
cup of cold turkey breast cut into dice, 
one cup of canned lobster cut into small 
pieces, one teaspoon of salt and a lib- 
eral seasoning of cayenne. Cook several 
minutes and flavor with three-quarters 
of a cup of sherry or marsala if liked; 
cook three minutes longer, then add 
three egg yolks and a cup of cream 
beaten together. Stir until the egg ip 
set and serve at once or the mixture 
will curdle. 

Asparagus Newburg 

Heat in the chafing-dish with a table- 
spoon of melted butter, a. cup of par- 
boiled asparagus tips, adding a saltspoon 
of salt and a pinch of black pepper; then 
pour in a wineglass of Madeira, if liked. 



MEMORANDA 301 



dUSS CHAFINO-DISH RECIPES 

and cook over the hot water pan for 
about three minutes; meanwhile beat 
until light the yolks of three eggs, to 
which add half a pint of double cream, 
and very gradually add this to the 
asparagus, stirring constantly; cook 
only for a moment or two or until the 
Newburg is well thickened and serve on 
triangles of toasted wheat bread. 

Creamed Chicken with Fresh Mush- 
rooms 

Take a small fowl, clean and cook 
till tender. When cold, cut the breast 
in small dice, and season with salt and 
pepper. Now take two tablespoons of 
good butter, one tablespoon of floxir, 
moisten with one cup of hot cream and 
beat over the fire till smooth. To this, 
add chicken with one quart of fresh 
mushrooms, cut in dice; let all simmer 
twenty minutes. Serve on strips of 
toast; garnish with green parsley. 

Creamed Kidneys 

One tablespoon- of butter is sauted 
with two of flour, then one cup of milk 
is added with salt and pepper. After 
this, some veal kidneys that have been 
carefully prepared and chopped fine are 
put in — ^about six small ones. Then one 
teaspoon each of finely minced parsley 
and the ubiquitous red pepper and a cup 
of cream in which there is one beaten 
egg yolk. When boiling it is served in 
tiny dishes. The kidneys are prepared 
by first soaking them in salt and water, 
then drain and cover with boiling water. 
Cook just five minutes — ^more boiling 
would make them tough. 

Creamed Terrapin 

Mix in the blazer two tablespoons of 
butter and one of flour and gradually 
stir in one pint of cream, a teaspoon of 
salt, a saltspoon of white pepper, the 
same of grated nutmeg, a pinch of 
cayenne pepper and a pint of terrapin 
meat, stirring all until scalding hot. 
Place over the hot water pan where the 
contents will keep hot but will not boil. 
Then stir in four well-beaten eggs, but 
do not allow the terrapin to boil after 
adding the eggs. Just before serving 
put in a gill of good sherry wine, if 
liked, and a tablespoon of lemon juice.

304 CHAFING-DISH EEOIPKS 

Green Sea Turtle in Chafing-Dish 

Take one two-pound can of turtle 
meat, cut in small pieces, braise in two 
ounces of butter with a little onion. 
Add one-half pint of cream and two 
hard-cooked eggs cut rather fine. 
Thicken with a little flour mixed first 
with cold milk. Salt and paprika to 
taste, a glass of Madeira, if desired, and 
serve from chafing-dish on squares of 
toast with sliced lemon. 

Mock Terrapin in the Chafing-Dish 

Take the dark meat of a chicken cooked 
the day previous and half a pound of 
calfs liver; put together in the chafing- 
dish-, add two cloves of garlic, one small 
onion sliced, two stalks of celery; cover 
with boiling water and cook twenty 
minvtes. Take out and cut into dice. 
Cleanse the chafing-dish and put in a 
quarter of a poimd of butter; while the 
butter is melting, take the yo&s of two 
hard-cooked eggs, mash to a smooth 
paste, adding gradually a cup of cream. 
Add a tablespoon of flour to the butter, 
mix and add the cream and eggs, stir 
constantly until it reaches the boiling 
point, then add meat, a teaspoon of salt, 
a daeh of cayenne and just a suspicion 
of mace. Serve hot on rounds of but- 
tered toast. 

Crabs a la Creole 

Cut three slices of bacon in small 
pieces, put them in the hot dish, add two 
cups of crab meat cut into dice, then one 
green i)epper denuded of its interior and 
chopped fine, one cup of tomatoes, pulp 
and juice, and when boiling add one cup 
of fresh mushrooms (the canned ones 
are a makeshift), cut into small pieces, 
cook for a few moments, then serve in 
tiny nappies or stewpans. The latter 
are the most popular. 

Algonquin Oyster Stew (For four per- 
sons) 

Take four stalks of celery, cut fine 
with a silver knife to prevent it from 
discoloring. Take a piece of butter 
about the size of an egg, brown it well 
in the chafing-dish blazer, add the celery, 
cook it until thoroughly done, which will 
be in about ten minutes. Add one quart 
of bulk oysters with the liquor. Cook 
until the oysters curl. Cook for ten

306 CHAFINQ-DISH BECIPES 

minutes longer, season with salt and 
paprika and serve with hot browned 
oyster crackers. 

Delmonico Stew 

Cook four slices of bacon slowly, 
removing the fat as fast as possible. 
When the bacon is done and dry, dry 
it more by keeping it warm on a piece 
of brown wrapping paper. Put back 
into the blazer a little of the fat and 
add two cups of the meat of frogs' legs 
scraped from the bones, and add one 
cup of oyster crabs. Cook until tender, 
then add the bacon cut in small pieces 
and serve. For those who can afford 
oyster crabs and are not too squeamish 
to eat them, this dish is most acceptable. 

Lamb Piquant 

Cut cold lamb or mutton into 
small thin slices. Prepare the sauce in 
the blazer, beginning with two table- 
spoons of butter, then two of tomato 
catsup, three of currant jelly and one 
of tarragon vinegar. Add a sprinkling 
of salt and when hot one tablespoon of 
sweet red pepper minced fine. When this 
is boiling put in the meat and serve. 

Finnan Haddie 

This old friend has come to the front 
again dressed in cream sauce, with trim- 
mings of red pepper. It is exceedingly 
palatable if carefully prepared before- 
hand. This means that it must be 
soaked half an hour in cold water, skin 
side up, then drained and covered with 
hot milk. After resting five minutes in 
this bath it should be drained and every 
bit of skin and bone removed. The 
fiakes should then be cooked in butter 
for a moment before the cream sauce is 
added. Add half a teaspoon of Wies- 
baden sauce and one tablespoon of 
minced red pepper. 

Scotch Woodcock 

Shell and chop the whites of six hard 
cooked eggs very fine. Eub the yolks to 
a smooth paste with two tablespoons of 
melted butter, one-quarter teaspoon of 
salt, a dusting of paprika, half a teaspoon 
anchovy essence, or paste may be used, 
and a teaspoon of cornstarch. Add a 
cup and a quarter of rich milk and cook 
in a double boiler to a thick cream. 
Have ready a number of slices of thin 
crisp buttered toast ; spread a layer of the

chopped whites which have been kept 
warm over hot water, pile on a hot 
platter, pour over the remainder of the 
sauce and serve at once. 

India Curried Onion 

Fry sliced onions in butter or good 
fat; salt well and add one teaspoon of 
curry, two raw eggs and a few drops of 
lemon juice. Serve hot. 

Dream Cakes 

Put slices of American cheese between 
very thin slices of white bread and fry 
in butter, red pepper and salt. The 
pepper should of course be used accord- 
ing to taste, but they are supposed to be 
better when well seasoned. The bread 
should be thin enou^ to let the cheese 
melt throu^.
