DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



ON THE CHOICE OF ARTICLES OF DIET. 

To Choose Beef. — Good ox beef has an open grain, and yields 
easily to the pressure of the finger; it is smooth and juicy, of a 
rich carnation-color in the lean, and the fat is of a fine cream- 
color ; rich without being oily, firm without being hard. It is 
small in the bone, and full in the flesh. 

Mutton. — In choosing mutton select that which is of a rich red 
color, close in the grain and of a silky texture, juicy and lively in 
appearance, and whitish in the fat, but not shiny and tallowy. 
The flesh should pinch tender, and rise again when dented. 

Lamb. — Observe the neck vein in the fore-quarter, which should 
be of an azure-blue to denote quality and sweetness. The flesh 
should be light-colored and juic}', the fat white and rich, the bones 
thin and small. Lamb should be dressed while perfectly fresh, or 
the flavor will be destroyed. It is in season from April till August. 

Venison. — Pass a knife along the bones of the haunches and 
shoulders; if it smells sweet, the meat is new and good; if tainted, 
the fleshy parts of the sides will look discolored, and the darker 
in pi-oportion to its staleness. The clefts of the hoofs of young 
venison are close and smooth. The buck venison is in full season 
from May till Allhallo ws ; the doe, from Michaelmas to December 
or January. 

Veal. — The lean of good, well-fed veal is white, smooth, and 
juicy ; the fat is white, firm, and abundant. The flesh of a bull- 
calf is firmer and of a deeper color than that of a cow-calf, and 
the fat is harder; they are equally good for eating, if young and 
well-fed. It is easy to tell whether veal be newly killed, or stale, 
by its general appearance, as the color changes quickly, particu- 
larly under the kidney and the flaps of the breast. The flesh of 
stale- killed veal feels moist and clammy, the joints flabby and 
pliable, and it has a faint, musty smell. 

Pork. — If young and well-fed, the lean is easily broken between 
the fingers, and the skin indented if nipped with the nail ; the fat 
is white and waxy, and the rind thin and clean. Stale-killed pork 
is easily detected by the skin looking dark on the top, and clammy 
between the creases of the legs and shoulders, and by its strong, 
tainted smell. Pork is in season from August till March. 

Ham, and Bacon. — Run a knife along the bone of a ham; if it 
come out clean, and have a savory flavor, the ham is good ; if 
smeared and dulled, it is spoiled either by taint or is reasty. 
Hocks and gammons of bacon may be proved in the same way, 



8 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



Good bacon is red in the lean, and the fat is white, firm, and 
pulpy ; the rind is fine and thin. If it be sheathed with yellow, it 
is reasty and unfit for use. 

Poultry. — In selecting poultry choose those that are full-grown, 
but not old. When young and fresh-killed the eyes are full and 
bright, the joints neither stiff nor flabby ; the skin thin and ten- 
der, so that'it may be easily torn with a pin ; the breast-bone is 
pliable, yielding easily to pressure. Fowls, if young, have a hard, 
close vent, and the legs and comb are smooth. A goose, if young, 
has but few hail's, a yellow bill, and is limber-footed. Ducks, 
when fat, are hard and thick on the belly; if young and good 
they are limber-footed. 

Eggs.— Put your tongue to the larger end; if it feel warm, the 
egg is fresh; or put the egg into a pan of cold water; if perfectly 
fresh it will sink immediately, and so in proportion to its fresh- 
ness; a rotten egg will float en the top of the water. 

Butter. — The only way to try butter is by the smell and taste; 
never trust to its external appearance. Do not buy that which is 
speckled with pinky spots, nor that which has a milky appear- 
ance; such butter has not been well washed from the butter-milk, 
and will quickly turn sour or lose its flavor. 

Fish. — The best are thick and firm. When fresh they have stiff 
fins, bright scales, red gills, and eyes full and bright. Freshness 
is.best indicated by the smell. In proportion to the time they 
have been out of the water they are soft and flabby, the fins pliable, 
the scales dim, the gills dark, and the eyes sunken. Cod, turbot, 
&c, should be firm, white, clear, and transparent. Salmoiij mack- 
erel, herrings, &c. , are chosen by their brightness and brilliancy 
of color. Shell-fish, such as lobsters and crabs, can only be chosen 
by the smell, and by opening them at the joint to discover 
whether or not they are well-filled, for they sometimes feel heavy- 
through being charged with water. If a lobster be fresh, the tail 
will be stiff, and spring back sharply if pulled up. A cock lob- 
ster may be known by the narrowness of the back part of his tail 
and the stiffness of the two uppermost fins within it, while tnose-of 
a hen are soft, and the back of her tail is broader. 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 

General Remarks.— The chief art in making good soup lies in 
the judicious blending of the different flavors, so that nothing 
shall predominate. 

The scum should be taken off before the soup boils, or it will not 
be clear. All the fat is to be taken off. Simmer very softly. If 
soup be suffered to boil quickly, the goodness of the meat can 
never be extracted. 

Put the meat into cold water; let it be long on the fire Jbefore* it 
comes to a boil; allow about two tablespoonfuls of salt to a gallon 
of soup, if it have many vegetables ; less if the vegetables be few. 
From a pint and a half to a quart of water to every pound of 
meat will make good soup. If the water waste, and more is to be 
added, use boiling water. Cold or lukewarm water will spoil the 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



soup. Keep the saucepan in which your soup is boiling closely 
covered, or the strength will fly off with the steam. 

Soup will be as good the second day as the first, if heated to the 
boiling-point. It should never be left in the saucepan but should 
be turned into a dish or shallow pan, and set aside to get cold. 
Never cover it up, as that will cause it to turn sour very quickly. 

Before heating a second time, remove all the fat from the top. If 
this be melted in, the flavor of the soup will certainly be spoiled. 

Thickened soups require nearly double the seasoning used for 
thin soup or broth. 

Brown soup is made chiefly of beef; white soup of veal. 

1. To Make Stock.— Bone a leg or shin of beef of ten pounds' 
weight, saw the bone in three, and take out the marrow. Put the 
bone into a saucepan with six quarts of water, and set it on to 
boil. Put the marrow into another saucepan with the meat, cut 
up small, and a pound of lean ham or bacon ; turn it well about 
till it is fried a nice brown, then add the liquor from the bones, 
cover up the pot and simmer for four or five hours. Strain it 
through a hair-sieve, and set it by till cold; the fat may then be 
taken off, and it will be ready for any soup that may be required. 
This forms the foundation of gravy, ox-tail, vegetable, and other 
soups. 

2. Mock Turtle. Soup. — Take a calf's head, the skin having been 
scalded and the hair scraped off clean, wash it thoroughly; take 
out the brains and boil them separately till done enough. Put the 
head into a pot with more water than will cover it. Skim it fre- 
quently till it boils, and let it boil for an hour, but very gently. 
Take it out, and when cool, cut the meat into pieces of about an 
inch square. Scrape and cut the tongue in the same manner. 
Lay all these pieces aside, then put into the water in which the 
head was boiled, about three or four pounds of leg of beef and a 
knuckle of veal — the meat cut small and the bones broken. Add 
four or five onions, a carrot and turnip, sliced, a small bunch of 
sweet herbs, and some whole black and Jamaica pepper. Boil all 
together slowly, for four or five hours, then strain it and let it 
cool, when take off the fat. Now melt a lump of butter in a stew- 
pan, put to it two handfuls of flour, and let it brown, stirring it 
all the time. Add a little of the soup, a sprig or two of sweet 
basil, and a few sprigs of parsley. Boil this for a quarter of an 
hour, strain it through a sieve, put it with the pieces of meat, into 
the soup, with the brains pounded, and boil all together for an 
hour. Add half a teacupful of catsup, the juice of a lemon, cay- 
enne pepper, and salt, to taste, also four glasses of sherry, and 
when dished in a tureen, put in^ two dozen of force meat balls, and 
the same quantity of egg -balls; which are made as follows: 

3. Egg Balls. — Boil four or five eggs till they are quite hard. Take 
out the yolks and beat them in a mortar, with salt and cayenne 
pepper. Make this into a paste with the white of egg. Roll 
the paste into balls the size of small marbles. Roll them in a little 
flour and fry them in butter, taking care they do not break. 

4. Force-meat Balls. — Cut half a pound of veal and half a pound 
of suet fine, and beat them in a mortar. Have a few sweet herbs 
shred fine; dried mace beaten fine; a small nutmeg grated; a little 



10 

DOMESTIC COOKERY 



lemon-peel cut very fine ; a little pepper and salt, and the yolks of 
two eggs ; mix all these well together, then roll them in little round 
balls ; roll them in flour and fry them brown. If for white sauce, 
put them in a little boiling water, and boil them for a few minutes, 
tut do not fry them. 

5. Ox^tail Soup. — Make a quantity of brown soup with shin 
of beef; take two or three tails and cut them in pieces at the 
joints ; put them into the soup and stew them till tender, but not 
till the meat leaves the bones. Add a little catsup, and serve it 
with the pieces of tail in the soup. 

6. Vegetable Soup. — Take the liquor in which any meat has been 
boiled ; cut into it two onions, two turnips, a large carrot, a head 
of celery, and a little parsley ; add also a bunch of sweet herbs ; 
boil all together for a couple of hours ; then take out the sweet 
herbs and rub the vegetables through a sieve ; have ready some 
chopped parsley, and boil all up again. Season with pepper and 
salt. Thicken, if required, with barley, rice, or sago. This soup 
may be made better by cutting into it a pound or two of lean 
beef. 

7. Mutton Broth. — This is an excellent broth for invalids, being 
of a very mild nature, and particularly efficacious to those whose 
stomachs have been rendered tender by much medicine. The best 
parts of mutton for making broth are either the scrag end of the 
neck or the chump end of the loin, which should be put into a 
clean saucepan with cold water in the proportion of a quart of 
water to every pound of meat. Throw in a little salt and skim it 
well as it comes to a boil; then set it aside that it may simmer 
very gently ; slice in an onion and two turnips; let it stew for 
two hours, and, just before you take it up, chop up a few sprigs 
of parsley very fine, and put into the broth, first taking out the 
mutton. Toast some bread in thin slices, and cut it in small 
squares into a basin; pour the broth over it, and serve the meat 
in a dish. The turnips may be strained dry and served plain, or 
mashed up with a little butter, pepper, and salt. Some prefer to 
thicken the broth with pearl barley. If for a sick person, omit 
the herbs and vegetables. 

8. Beef Tea. — Take a pound of lean beef, cut it small, and put it 
with a quart of cold water, into a saucepan ; add a little salt and 
two or three allspice. Put it on a slow fire and skim it carefully 
as it comes to a boil. Let it simmer gently for an hour, then 
strain it through a hair sieve. Some persons cut in a small onion, 
but that is scarcely fit for invalids. 

9. Beef Broth. — Take a leg of beef, cut it in pieces; put it into a 
gallon of water; skim it; put in two or three blades of mace, some 
parsley, and a crust of bread; boil it till the beef and sinews are 
tender. Toast bread and cut into dice; put it in a dish; lay in 
the beef, and pour on tne broth. 

10. Pea Soup. — This soup should be made with liquor in which 
any kind of meat has been boiled, but the liquor of salt pork gives 
it a more savory flavor. It can be made with water alone, if you 
have no pot-liquor; but in that case it is better to get a few bones, 
as they will add greatly to the flavor and nourishing qualities of 
the soup. Wash one quart of peas perfectly clean, put them into 



11 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



a not with the bones and three carrots sliced thin, and simmer 
trentlv for about an hour; then add four onions cut m thin slices, 
a head of celery, a few sweet herbs, and a few sprigs of parsley 
chopped very fine, and let the whole stew gently for three hours 
loneer taking care to stir it now and then, as the peas are apt to 
burn ' Press the whole through a colander with a spoon, season it 
with'pepper and salt to your palate put it over the fire ag T„2 
have it quite hot, and serve it up with some thin toasted bread and 
some dried mint rubbed fine. . 

It should be observed, that split peas will not soften m salt 
liquor; therefore, if you make your soup of salt pork or salt beet 
liquor, it will be necessary to boil the peas by themselves in a 
small quantity of soft water until they a* melted; the vegetables 
meantime will be cooking in the liquor, and the peas, when suffi- 
ciently done, must be added. Green peas make an excellent soup 
in summer. The peas are boiled to a pulp and then rubbed 
through a sieve, afterwards flavored with pepper and salt. 

STEWS, HASHES, AND SAVORY DISHES. 
General Remarks.— Hashing meat is a method of re-cooking 
dressed meat. The meat ought never to be suffered to boil, or it 
will become hard and tasteless. The gravy should be made first^ 
the flour and all the ingredients added to flavor it, should be- 
properly cooked; the meat should then be put in, and just heated 

th Stews'are made of uncooked meat, and require very little water, 
delicate and savory seasoning, and thorough, though slow cook- 
ing so as to render the meat soft and tender. The butter which 
is added to make a stew rich should be melted not oiled nor m 
too great quantity; all the fat of the meat should be skimmed 
clean off, and the flour for thickening should be added gradually, 
in order to avoid lumps, which, when once formed, can only be 
dissolved by rubbing through a hair sieve. 

The seasoning depends on the judgment and taste of the cook. 
All the flavors should be made to blend m harmony; neither the 
pepper, salt, spice, herbs, nor any of the vegetables, should be 
suffered to predominate. , . 

Stews may be thickened with flour, rice, arrowroot, or barley. 

11 For Browning and Thickening Gravy or Soiip.—Take a 
lump of butter the size of an egg, put it into a stewpan with a 
tablespoonful of sugar, and stir them together ti 11 they become ot 
a dark brown, then dredge in sufficient flour to thicken it. 

12 To Make Brown Gravy.— Cut the meat into pieces, season it 
with pepper and salt, and put it into a saucepan with a lump of 
butter; fry it quite brown, taking care that it does not stick to 
the pot; pour boiling water to it, a pint to each pound; let it sim- 
mer three hours, skimming it clean, then let it stand and settle, 
strain and set it aside for use. Thicken it as ; required 

13 To Make Gravy for a Hash of Cold Meat-Cut a small 
onion into quarters or slices and fry it in a saucepan with alump 
of butter; add a sufficient quantity of water, pepper, and salt. 



12 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



and a spoonful of catsup; let it boil till the onion is tender, strain 
the gravy and thicken it with flour; let it boil a little longer, then 
add the meat, which is to be heated quite through, but not to be 
Buffered to boil. 

14. Curries and Curry Powder. — Chickens, rabbits, and veal 
are most suitable for curry. Boil the meat till tender, then sep- 
arate the joints, put the meat into a stew-pan with a lump of but- 
ter and a little of the liquor in which it was boiled, and stew it 
for twenty minutes longer ; then to four pounds of meat take a 
tablespoonf ul of curry powder, a teacupful of boiled rice, a table- 
spoonful of flour and ope of melted butter, a teacupful of the 
liquor and half a teasp%onful of salt; mix them, and stew the 
meat in the liquor for ten minutes, when it will be ready to serve. 
Boiled rice is served as an accompaniment. 

15. Curry Powder. — Coriander seed and tumeric, of each three 
ounces; ginger, pepper, and mustard, of each one ounce; half an 
ounce of cardamons; cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and cumin-seed, 
of each a quarter of an ounce. Pound them fine, sift, and bottle 
the mixture, then cork tight. 

16. To Hash Cold Meat— Cut the meat in thin slices off the 
bones, and lay it on a dish; sprinkle on some pepper and salt; put 
the bones into a pot with a little water; slice in a small onion, and 
let them stew to make gravy; take out the bones, and thicken the 
gravy with a little flour; add also a spoonful of catsup, boil it 
tip, and then lay in your meat ; shake it all up, and let it get hot 
through. Pour it into a dish on some thin snippets of bread. 

17. Minced Veal. — Cut the meat from the bones, and, having 
minced it very fine with a small piece of lemon-peel and a sprig 
or two of parsley, grate over it a little nutmeg, and sprinkle on 
some pepper and salt ; now put the bones into the saucepan with 
Si small onion split in four, a sprig of savory, and one of mar- 
joram ; stew them to make gravy. When done, strain it off, and 
thicken it with a little flour and butter, give it a boil up, then turn 
in your mince, shake all well together, and let it get thoroughly 
hot, but do not to suffer it to boil ; pour it over some thin toasted 
bread. Fry thin rashers of bacon, and lay them round the dish. 

18. Alamode Beef. — Take a piece of clod or sticking of beef and 
cut it in small pieces, then put a lump of dripping into your pot 
with a good-sized onion cut thin; when quite hot roll the pieces 
of beef in flour and lay them in, stirring it well about ; when 
nicely browned all over, add boiliDg water, in the proportion of a 
quart to every pound of meat* this must be added by degrees, 
and the whole kept stirring well together all the time; then put 
in a few allspice, two bay-leaves, some black pepper, and a little 
salt; cover it up close, and set it by the side of the fire, so that it 
may stew very gently till the meat becomes quite tender, which 
it will in about three hours, when it will be ready to serve up. 

19. Stewed B7nsket of Beef . — Put a piece of brisket of beef, say 
of four pounds' weight, into a saucepan with a good lump of drip- 
ping or butter; brown it well all over, then pour in as much 
water as will nearly cover the meat, and, closing the lid tight, 
j?tew it gently for three hours, taking care that the meat does 
not burn to the pot, which may be prevented by putting a small 



13 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



plate beneath it. Boil a carrot, two turnips, and a few very 
small onions in another saucepan, just before you intend to serve 
np the dinner ; take a cupful of the liquor and mix in it two good 
tablespoonfuls of flour, some pepper and salt, and a little catsup; 
turn this, with the onions and the carrot, and the turnips cut in 
small squares, into the pot with the meat, and, shaking it well up, 
boil all together for a few minutes, when it will be ready. 
Should the beef be fat, the gravy will require skimming, which. 
must be done before you add the thickening. 

20. Savory Stewed Steak. — Take some slices of beef, pepper and 
salt them well, slice up a couple of onions thin, and lay a piece or 
two of the fat of the steak at the bottom of a clean saucepan, 
then some of the onion, and on that some more steak, and so on 
alternately till you have put all in; shake and turn it about 
frequently to keep it from burning ; it will presently be nice and 
brown; let it ste\v in its own gravy till the meat becomes tender, 
then take off all the fat from the top, mix some flour in two table- 
spoonfuls of water, witl a little catsup or pickled walnut 
liquor, and pour it gradually into the stew ; stir it about well, 
and just give it a boil up, serve it quite hot. 

21. Steioed Knuckle of Veal. — Let the saucepan be perfectly 
clean; wash the knuckle well; place four wooden skewers at the 
bottom of the pot, to prevent the meat burning; lay in your veal 
with two or three blades of mace, an onion, a little whole pepper, 
a sprig of thyme and some salt, with two quarts of water; cover 
it close, and let it simmer gently for two hours; when done 
enough, lay in it a dish, and strain the broth over it. The shoulder 
is very good stuffed and stewed. 

22. Ragout of Rabbit,— Wash and clean a good rabbit; boil the 
liver and heart, which chop fine, and mix with some good veal 
stuffing; fill the rabbit, and sew it up. Put two pounds of fat 
beef, and the same weight of pickled pork, into a saucepan with a 
quart of water and a good-sized onion sliced. Let them simmer 
slowly for an hour, then put in your rabbit, and boil all together 
for another hour. Skim off all the fat about ten minutes before 
serving, and thicken the gravy with flour and butter. Season 
with pepper and salt, and add a bunch of parsley boiled soft, and 
green and finely chopped. Lay the rabbit and the meat in a hot 
dish, and pour the sauce over. 

23. Stetced Rabbits. — Clean the rabbits thoroughly, cut them up, 
and scald them for a short time; put some sliced onions and a bit 
of dripping into your pot, and fry the rabbits with them till slight- 
ly browned, dredge in a little flour, then add hot water sufficient 
to make gravy, pepper and salt, and a little catsup. Stew them 
very gently for an hour. 

24. Irish Stew. — Put two pounds of breast of mutton into a pot, 
with a pint and a half of water and a pinch of salt ; let it stew 
gently for an hour ; then take off all the fat ; take out the meat 
and cut it into small pieces; have ready four pounds of potatoes, 
pared and cut in halves; three or four good-sized onions, peeled 
and sliced; and pepper and salt, mixed in a cup. When you have 
taken the fat off the broth as closely as possible, put in a layer of 
potatoes; then sprinkle two or three pieces of meat with the pep- 



14 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



per and salt, and lay them on the potatoes, then a layer of the 
sliced onions, then another layer of potatoes, one of mutton, then 
one of onions, and so on till the whole is in. Cover close, and let 
it stew very gently for another hour, shaking it frequently, that 
it may not burn. 

85. To Dress Lamb's Head and Pluck.— Wash the head thorough- 
ly clean, and remove the brains; put the head, with the heart and 
part of the liver, into a saucepan, and cover it with water. Put 
in also a small onion, peeled, and a little salt; skim it often as it 
comes to the boil, and let it boil very gently for an hour and a 
quarter; take them out, and lay the head flat on the dish; put it 
before the fire to brown; put the brains, which have been thor- 
oughly washed and picked, into the liquor, to boil, while you 
mmce, very small, the heart and liver; then take out the brains 
and mmce them also; dredge over them a tablespoonful of flour, 
and add a little chopped parsley, pepper and salt; put this back 
into the saucepan with as much of the broth as will make it a 
good thick sauce ; boil it up two or three times, and pour it over 
the head. A few thin slices of bacon, fried and laid round the 
dish, is a great improvement. 

26. Haricot Mutton.— Make a good gravy bv boiling the rough 
bits and trimmings, seasoning it with pepper and salt and a little 
catsup. Strain, and add carrots, parsnips, onions, and celery 
previously boiled tender; slice them in; then pepper and salt 
your mutton; broil it brown; put it into the gravy along with 
the vegetables; and stew all together for about ten minutes or a 
quarter of an hour. Garnish with small pickles. 

27. Bubble and Squeak. — Cut cold boiled beef in slices about a 
third of an inch thick. Fry them till heated through, and of a 
light brown; keep them hot before the fire. Have ready chopped 
some cold boiled cabbage; fry this in the pan, stirring it well 
about, and season it with peppr and a very little salt. Put the 
cabbage into a dish, and l&y the meat around it. 

28. To Prepare Sausage Meat— Take one-third fat, and two- 
thirds lean, of either pork or beef, chop it very fine, and to every 
twelve pounds of meat add twelve spoonfuls of pounded salt six 
of ground pepper, and, if agreeable, nine spoonfuls of sifted sage, 
with a little dried winter savory rub tied to a powder. Mix welh 
and put the meat into skins, or make it into flat balls and fry them 
in hot fat. ' 

Bologna sausages are made of veal, pork, and ham, in equal 
quantities, chopped fine and seasoned with sweet herbs and pep- 
per, then put into skins, boiled till tender, and dried. 

29. Beefsteak Pudding— Rub half a pound, of dripping or lard, 
or suet, into a pound and a half of flour, with a pinch of salt, and 
make it into a stiff paste with as little water as possible; then 
having greased the inside of your basin, lay a thin crust over the 
same, except just the bottom, as it will else absorb all the gravy 
now have ready some pieces of steak or beef -skirt, well seasoned 
with pepper and salt, put a piece of fat at the bottom, then lay 
an all your meat; after which pour in about a teacupful of broth 
or water, then moisten the edges of the crust round the basin and 
Jay on a cover of the remainder of the paste, pinching the two 



16 

DOMESTIC COOKERY 



edges together; dip your cloth into hot water, flour it well, and 
tie it tightly over the pudding. Put it into a saucepan of boiling 
water, make it boil up quickly, and keep it boiling from three to 
four hours. 

TO DRESS VEGETABLES. 

General Directions.— Pick and wash greens thoroughly; pick 
them close, for an outside leaf will deteriorate a dishful: split the 
stems of cabbages across twice. They should be washed in a pan 
as particles of sand or dust hang round wooden vessels; do not 
pour or pump the water on them, but plunge them m thiow into 
fee water a good handful of salt, as that will draw out worms or 
other insects which you cannot see without pulling the vegetables 
to pieces. All greens should be boiled by themselves, in plenty of 
water, with a good lump of salt: the water should boil when they 
are put in, and be kept boiling; they should be well done or they 
are unwholesome; a very little bit of soda put into the water 
mellows the greens and preserves their color. 

No directions can be given as to the time vegetables take foi 
boiling; much depends on size and age. lo ascertain when they 
are done, pass a fork through the stem; if soft they are done; 
they begin to sink when nearly boiled enough. Greens should do 
perfectlv strained immediately they are done. 

30 To Dress Potatoes.— In general it will be found best to pare 
them before boiling; thev should also be as nearly of a size as pos- 
sible, or the small ones will break before the large ones are done; 
they should be put into cold water scarcely enough to cover them, 
with a good lump of salt; they should boil slowly, and when they 
begin to crack the water should be poured off; then set the sauce- 
pan over the fire with the lid off, till they are quite dry and 
mealv. On serving, cover them with a clean napkin. 

31 To Boil Green Peas.— Peas should be boiled as soon as 
shelled. Put them into boiling water with a little salt; no soda, 
as that will break them. The time they will take depends on 
their age; in general about twenty minutes is enough. When 
done, strain them through a sieve and pour them into a vegetable 
dish over a good lump of butter. A few sprigs of green mint 
should be boiled and served up with the peas. ■ 

32 To Boil Beans.— After shelling, put them into boiling water 
with a handful of salt; they will be cooked in about half an hour •, 
when the skins feel tender they are done enough; strain them, 
and serve them with parsley and butter. 

33. Haricot Beans.— These are a very agreeable vegetable, an£ 
will be found a good substitute for potatoes when the latter are 
scarce and dear. They may be dressed in several ways. As they 
are the dried seeds of the French bean, they require soaking for 
several hours before they are fit to cook. Put them into cold 
water with salt in it, and let them simmer for three or tour hours. 
As soon as they begin to crack, pour off the water and stand them 
on the hob to dry. They are eaten with the gravy of the meat 
like potatoes, unless preferred with melted butter. 



18 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



34. French or Scarlet Beans. — Cut off the two ends and striae 
them, then split and cut them in two, throw them into a pan of 
clean water, and put them into plenty of boiling water with some 
salt and a little bit of soda. When they are soft, which will be 
in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, strain 
them through a sieve, and serve them with melted butter in a 
boat. 

85. To Boil Turnips. — Pare your turnips pretty thick, split 
them and boil them in plenty of water, with salt in it, for about 
half an hour; try them with a fork; if tender, they are done; 
strain and serve them with a little melted butter in a boat, or 
mash them up with a little butter, pepper, and salt. They should 
be boiled by themselves. 

36. To Boil Carrots.— Scrape and wash them, then split them in 
two, if very large, into four, and cut them across ; they require 
long boiling to make them soft. Parsnips are dressed in the 
same manner. When cold they are very nice cut in slices and 
fried. 

87. To Boil Cabbages.— Cut off the stalk, and strip off the outer 
leaves, quarter, and wash them in plenty of water, and leave them 
to soak, top downwards, with a little salt in the water, for an 
hour or two. Put them into plenty of boiling water, with a good 
handful of salt and a bit of soda, and boil them till the stalk feels 
tender. Cabbages require boiling from twenty to forty minutes, 
according to their age and size. Drain them through a colander. 
Greens may be pressed between two plates. 

88. To Dress Cauliflowers. — Having picked it into small pieces, 
which is absolutely necessary in order to remove the slugs with 
which this vegetable abounds, wash it thoroughly in several 
waters, and let it lay to soak for full an hour before you dress it. 
Put it into a saucepan of boiling water with a lump of salt, and 
when tender it will be done; let it drain in a colander, and serve 
it up with melted butter. Some persons may prefer to see them 
brought to table whole; but they must then take the chance of 
being helped, along with tho cauliflower, to some unsightly insect, 
which would be sufficient to disgust the least delicate stomach; 
besides, if properly boiled, and laid carefully in the dish, the 
pretty appearance of the vegetable is by nq means destroyed by it 
having been divided. 

39. Broccoli Sprouts. — Pick and wash them well, and boil them 
in plenty of water, with salt in it; when they are tender strain 
and let them cool ; when cold, to heat them again, dredge them 
with flour, and fry them in butter, sprinkle them with a little 
salt, and serve them up. 

40. To Dtvss Spinach. — It must be carefully picked, the yellow 
leaves removed, and the ends of the stalks cut off. It requires to 
be washed in four or five waters, as it is apt to be gritty. When 
quite clean lay it in a colander to drain. Put it into a saucepan 
of boiling water, with a large tablespoonf ul of salt. When it has 
boiled a few minutes strain the water off, and fill up again with 
boiling water, adding salt as above. Keep it boiling till quite 
tender, pressing it down frequently, that it may be done all alike. 
It will be done enough in about ten minutes or a quarter of an 



17 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



hour. When done, squeeze it between two plates till thoroughly 
dry, lay it on a dish, and cut it quite through in small squares. 

41. Asparagus. — Cut the heads about four or five inches long; 
scrape them and throw them into cold water; tie them in bundles; 
put them into boiling water with plenty of salt in it; let theni 
come quickly to a boil— they will take from a quarter of an hour 
to twenty minutes. When tender take them up with a slice; 
drain them well ; remove the string, and lay the asparagus in a 
dish, heads inwards, on slices of toast previously dipped in the 
liquor. Serve with melted butter. Seakale is dressed in the same 
manner. 

42. Beets. — They must not be scraped or cut, as they would then 
lose their color and sweetness. Salt the water, and boil them for 
an hour, in summer, and in the winter for three hours. It makes 
a fine pickle if cut into slices when cold, and put into vinegar. 

43. Onions. — Select the white kind, peel them, and put them 
into boiling milk, with a little salt, and let them boil from half an 
hour to three-quarters. Drain them through a colander and serve 
theni with melted butter. 

44. Tomatoes. — Pour scalding water over them to loosen the 
skins*, thus let them remain for five minutes; then peel and put 
them into a stewpan, with a little salt and butter; stew them for 
half an hour ; then pour them on buttered toast. Tomatoes are 
best cooked slowly. 

45. Vegetable Marrow. — If large, cut them into quarters: other- 
wise they will not need it. Boil them till soft, then peel them — 
and some take out the seeds; lay them on buttered toast, and pour 
melted butter over them. They may be served in slices on toast, 
like asparagus, or mashed, like turnips, with butter, pepper and 
salt, and a little lemon peel. 

46. To Dress Mushrooms.— Cut off the lower part of the stem, 
peel, and put them into a saucepan, with just enough water to 
keep them from burning: put in a little salt, and shake them 
occasionally. When tender flavor them with butter, pepper and 
salt; add wine and spice if agreeable. Serve on buttered toast. 

47. To Coon Bice. — Pick, and wash it in cold water. To a pint 
of rice put three quarts of boiling water and a teaspoon ful of salt. 
Let it boil just seventeen minutes from the time it fairly comes to 
a boil; then pour off all the water ? and set it over a moderate fire 
with the saucepan uncovered ; let it steam fifteen minutes. Accu- 
racy with regard to time is very important. 

48. Artichokes. — Boil them till tender, let them drain, and serve 
them with melted butter. They must be well washed and soaked 
before cooking. 

49. Jerusalem ArticJwkes. — Scrape and wash them clean, and 
put them into boiling water with salt in it; large ones will require 
boiling for two hours. When done take them up and butter them. 

50. A Dressed Salad. — Take small salad, lettuce, endive, celery, 
radishes, and young onions: pick and wash them quite clean, cut 
them up in small pieces, put them into a salad-bowl or deep dish, 
and pour over them the following dressing: — Bruise the yolk of a 
cold, hard-boiled egg with the back of a spoon on a plate, then 
pour on it about a teaspoonful of cold water and the same meas- 



Is 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



ureof salt; rub all together till it becomes smooth like a thick 
paste; add a teaspoonful of made mustard, and when this is well 
■mixed also add and mix a tablespoon! ul of salad-oil or cold melted 
butter; after this add and mix two tablespoon fuls of vinegar. 
Ornament the top of the salad with small bite of the white of the 
egg and pickled beet-root alternately. 



ROASTING MEAT. 

General Remarks. — In roasting meat it is necessary to have 
a good clear fire, in size according to your joint, to keep the joint 
constantly in motion, so that it may not scorch, but be cooked 
equally in every part, and to baste infrequently with its own drip- 
ping. When two-thirds done sprinkle it with salt. A screen 
should be placed round the fire to keep in the heat. 

51. To Roast Beef. — Do not wash meat before putting it down to 
roast, as that will prevent its browning. Wipe it clean with a 
clean cloth, and hang it before the fire, which must act on all 
parts as uniformly as possible. The fire should be clear, free from 
all smoky coals in front, and of a strength according to what you 
have to roast. Do not place the meat too near at first, or you will 
have it browned on the outside before it is warm within. It is 
usual to allow a quarter of an hour to every pound of meat ; but 
much of course will depend on the strength of the fire, and some- 
thing also on the staleness or freshness of the meat. Fresh meat 
require more time to cook than that which is stale. When about 
half done sprinkle it with salt. A well-roasted joint should have a 
nice, rich brown tinge all over; and, in order to obtain this, atten- 
tion to the fire, and careful, frequent basting, is indispensable, 
as well as judgment to remove it when it is sufficiently cooked. 
As it approaches the proper time the steam will be drawn towards 
the fire. When your joint is done lay it in a clean hot dish, pour 
off all the fat, and pour the nice brown gravy at the bottom of the 
dripping-pan over the meat, but no hot water, or you will infalli- 
bly spoil the flavor of both gravy and meat. Good meat will fur- 
nish sufficient gravy when cut. Garnish with scraped horseradish. 

52. To Roast Mutton. — Mutton requires more cooking than beef , 
the latter being by many preferred somewhat underdone. A 
shoulder of mutton particularly, if it be not sufficiently roasted, 
has a strong woolly flavor ; the fat tastes rancid, and is apt to 
spoil the appetite of a delicate stomach ; if, on the contrary, it be 
nicely roasted brown, without being burned, and well basted, it is 
a delicious dish. Like beef, it must not be placed too near the fire 
at first, but must be suffered to become gradually hot through, 
and kept constantly turned. When you think it is about half 
done sprinkle a good bit of salt all over it, which is the general rule 
for all roasted meat. When it is done pour away the whole of the 
fat, and what little gravy remains at the bottom of the dish may 
be served up with the mutton. If it be good meat, the gravy will 
follow the knife as it is cut. Serve it up with onion-sauce. 

A leg of mutton is roasted in the same manner, except that, be- 
ing a much leaner joint, and the fat of a milder nature, it does not 



19 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



require so much cooking. The same may be said of the loin and 
the best end of the neck, care being taken to cut off the fat suffi- 
cientlj T close before roasting. 

53. To Roast Venison. — Venison is roasted in the same way as 
mutton, only it requires more time. Cover it with buttered paper 
and paste before you set it down to roast ; otherwise, it being such 
a dry sort of meat, and the little fat there is being so easily melted, 
the fire will draw out all the juices, and it will prove dry and 
tasteless. Baste it constantly, and serve it with a good gravy and 
currant jelly. 

54. To Roast Lamb. — Lamb requires to be well roasted, as if not 
sufficiently done, it will fail to acquire that delicate taste so pe- 
culiar to it. It is commonly dressed in quarters. Lamb should 
be well jointed, or chopped by the butcher, as it is such a delicate 
sort of meat that it becomes altogether disfigured if the carver is 
compelled to hack and pull it in pieces. In roasting, baste with 
its own dripping, and, after pouring off all the fat, serve it up in 
a hot dish with the gravy that remains after the fat is poured off. 
In serving up a fore-quarter, the cook should divide the shoulder 
neatly from the ribs, and, after squeezing the juice of half a 
lemon on the ribs cover the shoulder closely over again. It is 
usual to send up with lamb mint-sauce in a tureen. 

55. To Roast Veal. — All parts of veal are good roasted, except- 
ing the scrag end of the neck, which is commonly used for stew- 
ing or making pies. Roast veal is much improved by a stuffing 
composed of chopped suet and parsley, lemon-peel, a little thyme, 
savory, marjoram, a little grated nutmeg and bread-crumbs, 
seasoned with pepper and salt, all mixed together with an egg. 
The bones should be carefully taken out, and the stuffing put in. 
their place ; then cover your veal with buttered paper to prevent 
it burning, and set it down before a strong, clear fire, not too close 
at first, as it requires more di^essing than beef or mutton, it being 
extremely unwholesome if underdone. When nearly enough 
roasted, take off the paper and let it brown; sprinkle it with salt, 
and baste it well either with its own dripping, or, if there be not 
enough, with lamb dripping or butter. Pour melted butter over 
it before sending it to table. Garnish with lemon cut in quarters 
or sliced. 

56. To Roast Pork.— Pork should at all times be perfectly well 
done, and therefore requires a longer time to roast than any other 
meat. Pork is much more savoiy when stuffed with chopped 
sage and onions and bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt. 
The outer rind should be neatly scored, to enable the carver to 
cut slices more easily. Before setting it down to roast, rub the 
skin with salad-oil to prevent its blistering, and baste it frequent- 
ly. Serve it with apple sauce in a tureen or boat. The onions 
should be boiled a little before being chopped for the stuffing. 

57. To Roast Sucking Pig. — When the pig is properly prepared 
and cleaned by the butcher, cut off the feet, and making a stuffing 
of chopped sage, crumbs of bread, butter, pepper, and salt, ac- 
cording to your taste and judgment, but let the bread be the 
principal ingredient ; fill the inside of the pig with the stuffing, 
and sew up the slit. Baste with butter. It will require from twe 



20 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



to three hours' roasting, according to the size. The skin should 
be nicely browned and crisp. Before sending it to table, split it 
down the back from head to tail, and lay it, with the skin side 
uppermost, flat in the dish. The head is cut off and a half laid 
at each end. Take out the brains, and having previously boiled 
the liver, chop it up with the brains, and mix them together with 
veal or beef gravy in a small tureen. Apple-sauce as for pork. 

58. To Roast Ox Heart.— Having emptied out all the blood, 
wash it well and dry it with a clean cloth, cut off the deaf -ears, 
which lay to soak in a little lukewarm water. Fill all the open- 
ings of the heart with a good veal stuffing, and cover the top with 
a sheet of writing-paper to prevent scorching; suspend it with 
the pointed end downwards, and keep it well basted. It will re- 
quire about two hours to roast, as it should be well done. When 
nearly roasted or done enough, take off the paper and let it 
brown. While the heart is roasting, put the deaf ears into a 
clean saucepan, with a little water, some salt, an onion, and 
a few allspice ; let it stew gently, and keep it well skimmed. 
About a quarter of an hour before you serve up the heart, put a 
crust of bread nicely browned into your gravy, with a lump of 
butter rolled in flour; let it mix and boil up, then strain it through 
a sieve, and after skimming off all the fat from the dripping-pan. 
put the gravy that remains at the bottom, along with that 
which you have made, back into the gravy saucepan, and boil all 
together. Lay the heart in a very hot dish set over another filled 
with boiling water, pour a little of the gi'avy over it, and send 
up the remainder in a hot tureen. This is a very nice savory 
dish, but it chills so soon that the plates and dishes must be very 
hot; indeed, hot- water plates are always used by those who have 
them. Some persons boil the heart for a quarter of an hour be- 
fore putting it down to roast, in order to prevent its chilling too 
soon. 

What remains cold will be found extremely nice made into a 
hash the next day. It should be cut in thin slices with what stuff- 
ing there may be left, and warmed up with the gravy; a spoonful 
of catsup will be found a great improvement. Shake it well to- 
gether, and pour it into a deep dish over thin snippets of toasted 
bread. 



BOILING MEAT. 

General Dirhctions. — Meat should be boiled in a vessel large 
enough to contain it easity, so that it may have perfect freedom 
and sufficient water, otherwise it will be hard and discolored; but 
too large a pot will leave unnecessary space, which ought to be 
avoided. 

Before putting your joint into the pot, put in a plate turned up- 
side-down, so that the water may get to every part, and the meat 
may not stick to the bottom. All kinds of meat should be put 
into cold soft water; and with fresh meat throw in a little salt to 
raise the scum. The water should not be suffered to come to a 
boil too quickly, and just before it boils the scum should be re- 
moved, and for a few minutes afterwards: for if the scum be suf- 



21 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



fered to boil down, it will render the meat black. When it is 
skimmed, quite clean, cover the pot and set it aside, so that it may 
only simmer, taking great care, however, that it never ceases to do 
so. Should the water waste in the boiling, it will be necessary to 
add more, so as to keep the meat covered; in this case boiling 
water must be used. If the meat be boiled in a cloth it will be 
whiter, but the liquor will be spoiled. It is usual to allow a 
quarter of an hour to every pound of meat, reckoning from the 
time the water begins to boil ; but this is by no means an infalli- 
ble rule, as some parts of meat require much more cooking than 
others. A piece of brisket of beef, for instance, requires much 
more time for cooking than a piece of the round of the same 
weight ; and you would surely spoil the best end of the neck of 
mutton by boiling it the same length of time as the breast. The 
cook must use her own judgment on these matters. When meat 
is perfectly fresh it requires more time for cooking than when 
stale or long killed. Good meat invariably swells in boiling. 

If corned meat be too salt, you may pour off the water after 
it has boiled a few minutes, and replace it with fresh. 

59. To Boil a Salted Round of Beef .— Rinse it in a pan of cold 
water, cut out the bone, roll it round firmly, and bind it fast with 
a broad tape ; put it into the pot and cover the lid close ; keep it 
gently simmering, taking care to skim before it comes to a boil ; 
allow a quarter of an hour to each pound of beef. The vegetables 
served with salt beef are carrots and greens, and sometimes tur- 
nips are added. When you dish it up, pour over the meat a very 
little of the liquor in which it has been boiled. Do not, if 30U 
can avoid it, boil any vegetables with the meat. 

60. To Boil an Aitch-bone of Beef. — Follow the directions given 
for the round, only that a large one will take less time in propor- 
tion; for instance, one weighing twenty pounds will be done in 
rather less than four hours. 

61. To Boil a Piece of BHsket of Beef or Thin Flank.— These are 
boiled in the same way as the round, only that they require much 
longer boiling, being of so close a texture, and the fat of such a 
peculiar nature, that, if not sufficiently cooked, the meat will be 
hard and spongy, and will taste extremely disagreeable ; so much 
so that persons who have once partaken of those parts under- 
boiled wall feel very unwilling to eat of them again. A piece of 
brisket or thin flank of beef, weighing eight pounds, will take four 
hours' boiling. To know if it be boiled enough, you may insert a 
fork through the meat a little way, and if it feel soft, then it is 
done. Peas-pudding is good with boiled beef. Brisket of beef 
if to be eaten cold, should be laid on a board, and a heavy weight 
should be set on it, to press out all the loose fat; it then cuts 
smooth and solid. 

* 63. To Boil a Leg of Mutton. — If your pot be not long enough 
to let the leg lie straight, you may cut the tendon at the joint and 
bend round the shank. Do not put in too much water, as the 
liquor will make good broth. Throw a little salt into the water 
when you put in the mutton, as that will make the scum rise, 
which must be taken off clean. Let it boil slowly and equally. A 
good-sized leg of mutton, say of eight pounds, will be done suffi- 



22 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



ciently in two hours. Do not boil turnips or any other vegetable 
with the meat, as they will flavor it, and prevent its keeping so 
well when cold. Dish it with a very little of the liquor, as if the 
meat be good, and not too much boiled, it will yield sufficient 
gravy when cut. Mashed turnips form the appropriate vegetable 
to this dish, with caper sauce. 

63. Neck of Mutton is dressed the same as the leg. The breast 
requires more boiling and will take half an hour to the pound. 
Serve with parsley and butter. 

64. To Boil a Leg of Lamb. — A leg of lamb is a delicate dish 
when nicely boiled. If whiteness is desirable, wrap it in a clean 
cloth; only the liquor will then be spoiled for broth. Boil one of 
five pounds gently for about an hour and a half. When you dish 
it cut the loin into chops, fry them, and lay round it. Sauce plain 
melted butter, or parsley and butter. 

65. To Boil a Leg of Veal.— Take out the bone, and fill the space 
with a stuffing made of bread crumbs, minced salt pork, suet 
chopped fine, parsley, sweet herbs, pepper, salt; sew up the opening, 
or draw the flap over it, and skewer it down. Put it into a long- 
pot, and cover it with cold water with a tablespoonful of salt; 
skim it well, and let it simmer slowly till done enough, which may 
be ascertained by passing a fork into it. Serve with parsley and 
butter, or oyster-sauce. The liquor will make excellent soup or 
broth with the addition of vegetables. 

66. To Boil a Knuckle of Veal. — Break, or rather saw the 
knuckle into pieces; wash, and put it into plenty of water, with a 
little salt; let it boil gently for two or three hours, accord- 
ing to the size ; it requires to be well boiled, in order to soften the 
sinews, which, when sufficiently done, are most delicious; you 
must keep it well skimmed, as the liquor is excellent for broth or 
soup. It is eaten with boiled ham, bacon, or pickled pork. When 
dished, pour over it some good parsley and butter. 

67. To Boil a Chump of Veal.— Wrap the joint in a cloth in 
order to have it white arid delicate; put it into a pot with a little 
salt and cover it with water; let it simmer gently for about an 
hour and a half after it comes to a boii. When done, fry some 
thin rashers of ham or bacon, lay them round it on the dish, and 
serve it up with oyster-sauce. 

68. To Boil a Calfs Head.— Wash and cleanse the head thorough- 
ly ; take out the brains and soak them in cold water, and pick 
them quite clean. Boil the head slowly for an hour and a half ; 
then put the brains into a small saucepan, and boil them in half a 
pint of the liquor for halt an hour. Then take up the head in a 
dish, mash the brains and season them with pepper and salt: 
turn them back into the little saucepan, add a few bread-crumbs, a 
lump of butter rolled in flour, and a glass of wine; shake all well 
together, just give it a boil, and serve it for sauce, either poured 
over the head, or separately in a boat. The liquor will make ex* 
cellent soup the next day. 

69. To Boil a Sheep's Head. — Soak and wash the head well in cold 
water, taking care to remove all the splinters of the bones, and to 
clean the brains thoroughly of all the skin and blood. Put it into 
a saucepan, cover it with lukewarm water and a good spoonful of 



23 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



salt; let it boil very gently, skimming it well from time to time. 
When it has boiled about an hour, take off all the fat; and having 
cut up a good-sized onion, two turnips, a carrot, a small head of cel- 
ery, and a sprig or two of parsley, put them into the broth with a 
little thyme and a crust of bread toasted brown; cover up the 
saucepan, and let the broth simmer gently for an hour and a half, 
when the head will be done. Serve it up with the brains chop- 
ped up in melted butter, poured over it, and turnips in another 
dish. Serve the broth, which will be excellent, in a tureen. 

70. To Boil Pickled Pork. — Having washed and scraped it, put 
it into boiling water with the skin side uppermost. If it be thin, a 
piece of four pounds will be done in less than an hour; a leg of eight 
pounds will take three hours. Pork should be done enough ; but 
if boiled too fast or too long, it will become jelly. Keep the pot 
well skimmed, and send it to table with peas-pudding and 
greens. 

71. To Boil Bacon and Beayis. — These must be boiled sepa- 
rately, otherwise the bacon will spoil the color of the beans. Soak 
the bacon for an hour or two in cold water, trim and scrape it as 
clean as possible, and put it into enough cold water to cover it ; 
set it over a slow fire, so that it will be half an hour before it comes 
to a boil ; then skim it and let it boil gently till done. Two or three 
pounds wall require an hour and a half after it boils ; the hock 
or gammon, being thick, will require more time. When done 
enough, strip off the rind ; and your beans in the meantime having 
been boiled and strained, put them into a deep dish, lay the bacon 
upon them, and send them to table, with parsley and butter in a 
boat. 

73. To Boil a Ham. — If the ham has been long cured, soak it in 
cold water for from twelve to twenty hours. Scrape it and put 
it into a large vessel to boil with plenty of cold water, and let it 
simmer gently from three to four or five hours, according to the 
size. A ham of twenty pounds will require four hours and a half. 
Skim the pot frequently, to remove the grease as it rises. When 
done, strip off the rind, and stew bread raspings over the top side ; 
then set it before the fire, or in the oven, to dry and brown. 
Some persons prefer to bake a ham ; it is then necessary, after 
soaking and scraping, to inclose it in a paste of flour and water 
before sending it to the oven. 

73. To Boil a Tongue. — Soak it all night before using, and be 
careful to wash out the salt, which is put into various crevices to 
preserve it. Boil it in plenty of water from two hours and a half 
to three hours. Remove the skin before sending it to table, and 
garnish with parsley. 

74. To Boil Tripe. — Wash it clean and put it on to boil in plenty 
of water with four or six moderately sized onions. When the 
onions are quite soft the tripe will be boiled enough. Serve it 
with the onions in a hash-dish with a little of the liquor in which 
it has been boiled, and plain melted butter on a boat. 

75. To Boil Cow Heel.— Cow heel should be boiled till the bones 
will slip out, with an onion and some salt in the water. Serve with 
parsley and butter. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



FRYING. 

General Remarks.— In frying much depends on the pan be- 
ing in good condition and perfectly clean. If it be thin, it soon 
becomes so hot that it either scorches the meat or sets the fat 
alight; and if it be not clean to a nicety, it discolors the meat and 
gives it a bad flavor. It should never be cleansed with anything 
but fat ; washing it with water makes it rusty. After frying fish, 
turn the pan over the fire for a minute or two ; this will destroy 
the smell and taste of the fish. The fire should be clear and brisk, 
not blazing, but strong. 

Lard or dripping is best to use for frying in. To know if the 
fat be the right heat, throw in a bit of bread, which should fry a 
light brown. Shake the pan constantly while frying, to prevent 
the meat sticking or burning. Drain the fat off your fish or meat 
by laying them on a wire sieve. 

76. To Fry Sausages. — Sausages require to be dressed very 
slowly. Before you put them into the pan prick them in several 
places with a fine fork, to prevent them bursting; put a lump of 
dripping into a clean frying-pan, and as soon as it is melted, but 
before it becomes hot, put in the sausages ; shake the pan fre- 
quently, so that they may not stick; let them get hot very gradual- 
ly, and brown them nicely all over. When done lay them on a 
hot dish before the fire. 

77. To Fry Liver and Bacon. — Wash the liver, but do not soak 
it; dry it, and cut it in slices rather thin; then scrape your bacon, 
cut off the rind, and slice it very thin ; make your pan hot, and 
fry the bacon quickly, and not too much ; it will yield sufficient 
fat in which to fry the liver; lay the bacon in a hot dish before 
the fire, and fry the liver, which also should not be too much 
done, or it will be dry. When the liver is done enough lay it over 
the bacon, and pour mto the pan half a cupful of flour and water 
with a little pepper, but no salt; stir it well about, and strain 
whatever fat or gravy may be in the dish, under the liver and 
bacon, into the pan, let it boil up, then pour it over the meat, or 
garnish with sliced lemon. 

78. To Fry Beefsteaks and Onions. — Cut the steaks about 
three-quarters of an inch thick; put a good lump of dripping or 
lard mto your pan, and when it is hot lay in the steaks; turn them 
frequently, so that they may not burn ; let them be nicely browned 
all over, and, when cooked, lay them in a hot dish before the fire; 
meantime, have in readiness a plateful of onions, sliced very thin, 
and sprinkled with pepper and salt ; put them into the pan, and 
lay a dish over them to keep in the steam ; turn them about, and 
let them be cooked thoroughly. They will require a long time; 
they should be soft and brown ; when done pour them over the 
steaks and serve up hot. 

79. To Fry Veal Cutlets.— Veal cutlets should be fried either in 
veal dripping or butter. Cut them half an inch thick, beat up an 
egg, and with a whisk lay it over the cutlet on eache side ; after 
which dip it in bread-crumbs and lay it in the pan. Dress cutlets 
slowly and thoroughly, of a light brown. For gravy, take half a 
cupful of water thickened with flour, a lump of butter, a little 
pepper and salt, a pinch of sweet herbs rubbed fine, and a little 



25 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



lemon- juice; mix all together and put into the pan; boil it up and 
pour it over the cutlets. It is usual to fry bacon or ham with veal 
cutlets, and to serve them in a separate dish. Lamb chops are 
fried in the same way. 

80. To Fry Pork Chops. — Cut them rather thin, and cook them 
thoroughly. They are more savory if dipped in yolk of egg and 
strewed over with sage and onion finely chopped and mixed with 
bread-crumbs previous to frying. 

81. To Fry Bacon and Eggs. — Cut the bacon in thin rashers 
and fry it as before directed; when done lay it in a hot dish before 
the fire. Break the eggs in separate cups and place them gently in 
the pan; keep them in a round flat shape. When the white is set 
take them out of the pan with a slice, and place an egg on each 
rasher. 

82. To Fry Tripe. — Wash the tripe, and dry it well in a cloth. 
Cut it in long pieces about three inches wide. Make a thick batter 
of egg, flour, milk, a little minced onion, and a little salt. Dip the 
tripe"into the batter and fry it in lard or good dripping, of 
winch there must be sufficient in the pan almost to cover the tripe. 
Fry it of a light brown, and garnish with fried parsley. 

83. To Fry Parsley. — Fried Parsley is used only for garnishing. 
It must be well dried first, and then fried in hot butter or drip- 
ping. Lay it on a sieve before the fire to drain the fat from it. 
In garnishing, place it round the edge of the dish. 



BROILING. 

General Directions. — For broiling, the fire should be brisk 
and perfectly clear; a good strong cinder fire is best. Set the 
gridiron over for a minute or two to get hot, then wipe it quite 
clean with a clean damp cloth — do not use paper: then rub a bit 
of hard dripping or suet over the bars, to prevent the meat stick- 
ing to them. Put the lean of the meat on the back part of the 
gridiron, and the fat in the front; pepper your meat before you 
lay it on, but do not salt it, as that draws out the gravy. Turn 
the meat once or twice, but do not insert a fork for that purpose. 
Do not beat the meat before broiling; it will not make tough meat 
tender, and it expels the juices. 

Broiled meat should be cooked quickly, and served quite hot; 
on taking it off the gridiron, lay it on a hot dish, sprinkle it with 
salt, and lay a good lump of butter over it. Some persons like 
catsup or walnut-liquor with broiled meat ; others like the dish 
rubbed with a shallot. 

84. To Broil Beefsteaks.— Beefsteaks, when properly broiled, 
form a dish which is generally liked. The gridiron should be 
thoroughly clean, not only on the tops of the bars, but on the sides 
also. Cut the steaks about three-quarters of an inch thick; dust 
them with pepper before laying them on the gridiron ; they ought 
not to be turned too frequently ; indeed, some persons turn them 
only once; this, however, depends greatly on the taste of those 
who are to partake of them ; because, while some persons prefer 
them in a half-raw state, others like them well done. Rub a hot 



26 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



dish with a shallot, place the steaks when cooked in the dish, and 
rub them over with a lump of butter, sprinkle them with salt, 
and serve them up hot. They should be eaten immediately; 
every moment they stand they become deteriorated in proportion. 
Either oyster-sauce or niushroom-sauco may be used when any is 
required. 

85. To Broil Mutton Chops. — Mutton chops should not be broil- 
ed on too fierce a fire, otherwise the fat will cause the fire to flare, 
and the chops will be smoked and blackened. Pepper them the 
same as beefsteaks; but, unlike those, mutton chops require con- 
stant turning. They should not be overdone. "When done enough, 
lay them in a hot dish and sprinkle with salt; they require no 
butter, the chops being sufficiently fat. 

86. To Broil Ham,— Cut the ham about the third of an inch 
thick, and broil it very quickly over a brisk fire; lay it on a hob 
dish, pepper it, and put on it a good lump of butter. 

87. To Broil, i\)rk Chops.— These should not be cut quite so thick 
as mutton chops, and require more dressing: turn them frequent- 
ly, and make them a nice light brown. When dished, sprinkle 
upon them a little sage powdered very fine. 

88. To Broil Kidneys.— Split them through lengthways, and run 
an iron skewer through them to keep them flat; pepper them, and 
broil them over a clear fire. They should be lightly done. Serve 
them in a very hot dish, sprinkle them with salt, and put a bit of 
butter on each. 

89. To Boil Eggs. — The best way is to put them into cold water; 
and when they have boiled up once or twice, if fresh, they will be 
done. Some persons prefer putting them into boiling water; they 
should then boil three minutes after they come to a boil. 

90. To Poach Eggs. — Have a saucepan of water boiling, crack 
your eggs into separate cups, and put them, one at the time, into 
the water, taking a little into the cup before you turn the egg in; 
when the white has hardened round the yolk, which it will in a 
minute or two, take them out with a slice. They are delicious laid 
on rashers of fried bacon or ham. 

91. A very delicate Omelette. — Beat six eggs, the yolks and 
whites separately ; melt a bit of butter in a teacupful of warm 
milk, to which add gradually a teaspoonful of flour, a tablespoon- 
ful of salt, and a little pepper; then mix in the yolks of the eggs, 
and lastly the whites, beaten to a stiff froth. Bake immediately 
in a flat pan. Some ham cut fine and added is a great improve- 
ment; some persons like sweet herbs; others prefer some finely 
shred onion. 

92. Eggs and Spinach.— This forms a pretty dish for supper. 
Having boiled and prepared some spinach (see Vegetables), poach 
some eggs, trim, and lay them on the spinach. 



SAUCES. 

As sauces spoil by standing long after they are made, they 
should be prepared last, and served hot. 
93. Melted Butter.— Put a tablespoonful of flour into a clean 



27 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



saucepan, mix it carefully with a little water at a time, till you 
have about a cupful ; now cut into it, in small pieces four ounces 
of butter, shake it rapidly round till well mixed, then place it on 
the fire, watch it constantly, and keep shaking and turning it 
round until it boils; it is then ready. Be careful to turn it always 
one-way j or the butter will oil. Should this happen, you may re- 
cover it in some measure by putting into it a little cold water and 
pouring it backwards and forwards several times. For fish, some 
salt should be added, and a little pepper. 

94. Onion Sauce. — Peel the onions and boil them in plenty of 
water till they are perfectly soft; then strain them from the 
water and chop them very fine, season them with pepper and salt, 
and stir them into melted butter. Some persons add a little milk, 
which makes the sauce both rich and white. 

95. Egg Sauce.— Boil the eggs till they are quite hard. Peel 
and chop them fine, season with pepper and salt, and stir them 
into melted butter. 

96. Bread Sauce.— Crumble some stale bread very fine, set it on 
the fire in a saucepan, with as much sweet milk as will make it 
thick, put in a slice of onion, and stir it till the bread is soaked 
and the sauce is quite smooth. Season with pepper and salt. 

97. Mushroom Sauce. — Pick out the stems, skin them, and the 
mushrooms also. Cut them up small, and wash them; put them 
into a saucepan, cover them with water, and let them stew gently 
till they are soft, when they will yield a fine rich gravy ; then stir 
in a lump of butter kneaded into some flour to thicken it, and 
season with pepper and salt. 

98. Mint Sauce. — Pick off the leaves of fresh green mint; wash 
them, then chop very fine, mix up some vinegar and sugar, and 
stir in the mint. 

99. Oyster Sauce. — Simmer the oysters in their own liquor till 
they are plump ; strain off the liquor through a sieve, wash the 
oysters clean, and beard them; put them into a saucepan, and 
pour the liquor over them, taking care you do not pour in any of 
the sediment; add a blade of mace, a quarter of a lemon, a spoon- 
ful of anchovy-liquor, and a bit of horseradish ; boil it up gently, 
then take out the horseradish, the mace, and the lemon, the juice 
of which must be squeezed into the sauce. Now add some thick 
melted butter, toss it together, and boil it up. 

100. Anchovy Sauce, for FisJi. — Take a little good gravy, and 
anchovy, a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour, and stir all 
together till it boils. You may add a little lemon juice, catsup, 
red wine, or walnut-liquor, according to your taste. Some add 
cream. 

101. Lobster Sauce. — Take a fine hen lobster; when boiled, take 
out all the spawn and bruise it in a mortar very fine, with a little 
butter; take all the meat out of the tail and claws, cut it in small 
square pieces, and put it aside. Put into a saucepan a spoonful of 
anchovy-liquor, a spoonful of catsup, a blade of mace, a bit of 
horseradish, half a lemon, a gill of gravy, a little butter rolled in 
flour, just enough to thicken it, and half a pound of butter nicely 
melted. Boil it gently up for six or seven minutes ; then take out 
the horseradish, mace, and lemon, squeezing the juice of the latter 



28 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



into the sauce ; just simmer it up; then put in your lobster and 
spawn, and allow it to get hot through. 

102. Shrimp Sauce. — Take a half a pint of shrimps, pick and lay 
them aside; put the pickings into a little water, stew it a short 
time, then strain off the liquor, with which make your melted 
butter ; put in your shrimps, add a spoonful of anchovy-liquor and a 
little lemon-juice, and let it simmer altogether for a few minutes. 

103. A good Common Sauce for Fish. — Plain butter melted 
thick, with a spoonful of walnut-pickle or mushroom- catsup. 

104. Siveet Sauce.— Plain melted butter, sweetened with sugar 
to your taste. 

105. Caudle Sauce /or Plum Pudding. — Make melted butter, 
and stir it into a glass of sherry, half a glass of brandy or rum, a 
little sugar, grated lemon-peel and nutmeg. Shake the saucepan 
round, but do not let it boil after you have added the spirits. 

106. Apple Sauce. — Pare your apples, cut them in quarters and 
core them, put them into a saucepan with a very little water, let 
them boil till perfectly soft, then strain the liquor off, and mash 
the apples with a spoon ; add two or three cloves, or a little bit of 
cinnamon, a bit of butter, a little grated lemon-pell, and sugar to 
your taste; mix all together, and set the saucepan on the hob for 
a few minutes. 

107. Celery Sauce for Fowls and Game. — Take a large bunch of 
celery, wash and pare it clean, cut it in small thin pieces, and boil 
it gently in a little water till tender ; then add some beaten mace, 
nutmeg, pepper, and salt, thicken with a piece of butter rolled 
in flour, then boil it up, and pour it into a dish. 

You may make it with cream, thus: boil celery as before direct- 
ed, and add m?ce, nutmeg, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, 
rolled in flour, and half a pint of cream ; boil all together. 

108. Parsley and Butter. — Pick and wash a handful of parsley, 
tie it up, and throw it into boiling water for a minute or two; then 
cut away the stalks and chop the parsley very small ; make melted 
butter, and stir in the parsley. 

109. Wine Sauce for Mutton or Venison. — Take a sufficient 
quantity of the liquor in which the meat was boiled, put in pep- 
per, salt, currant- jelly, and wine to your taste; boil all up, and 
thicken it with scorched flour mixed with a little water. 

110. Mushroom Sauce for Boiled Fowls. — Stir half a pint of 
cream and a quarter of a pound of butter together one way, 
till it becomes thick ; then add a spoonful of mushroom pickle, 
pickled mushrooms, or fresh. Garnish with lemon. 

111. Caper Sauce. — Chop capers, and stir them into melted but- 
ter, adding some of the vinegar. 



TO DRESS POULTRY AND GAME. 

113. To Roast Fowls. — Pick and draw them; be careful not to 
break the gall-bag in drawing, as, if the gall be spilled, it will 
render any part which it touches bitter ; a fowl should be so clean- 
ly drawn as to require no washing, but merely to be wiped out 
with a clean dry cloth. Singe them; then press down the breast- 



29 

DOMESTIC COOKER Y 



boue. Break the legs by the middle of the first joint, draw out 
the sinews, and cut off the parts at the break. Put the gizzard in 
one pinion and the liver in the other, and turn the points on the 
back : put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion and bring the 
middle of the leg close to it; put the skewer through the middle 
of the leg^ and through the body, and the same on the other side; 
put nnother skewer through the small of the leg and the sides- 
man, and another through the other side. Cut the head off close 
to the body, leaving sufficient skin to tie on the back. Suspend 
it neck downwardsr Baste with butter for some time after put- 
ting to the fire. They will require from half an hour to an hour 
according to the size. When fowls are large they are very good 
stuffed like turkey. 

Serve roast fowls with melted butter or gravy-sauce. Before 
you send them to the table, remove all skewers and strings which 
may have been used in trussing. Fowls and all other feathered 
animals are served with the breast upwards. 

113. To Boast a Turkey. — Having picked, drawn, and singed 
the turkey, truss it according to previous directions for trussing 
fowls. Stuff the breast with rich veal stuffing, adding a little 
sausage-meat; sew up the neck. Cover the breast with buttered 
paper, to preserve it from scorching, and roast it to a fine brown. 
Baste it well with butter, and a little while before it is done re- 
move the paper and allow the breast to brown. A good-sized 
turkey will require roasting from an hour and a half to two 
hours. You must have plenty of good gravy in the dish, and 
garnish with lemon. Serve with bread-sauce. 

114. To Roast a Goose. — Having picked, drawn, and singed the 
goose, cut off the bead and neck, leaving sufficient skin to tie oyer 
the neck-bone. Take off the legs and wings at the first joint. 
Stuff with chopped sage and onion, and a few bread-crumbs sea- 
soned with pepper and salt. Cut off the end of the veni, and 
make a slit sufficiently large to admit the rump through, in order 
to keep the stuffing in. Tie the skin of the neck securely, to pre- 
vent the gravy from running out, and tie a string round the 
goose over the wings, and another over tbe legs. Paper the 
breast for a short time. Rub a few pieces of butter in the shoul- 
ders and back, to baste with : but, as it is naturally greasy, it will 
soon yield sufficient fat for that purpose. It will require full two 
hours' roasting. It should be well done. Serve it with plenty of 
gravy and apple-sauce. The liver, gizzard, head, neck, feet and 
pinions of the goose form what is termed the giblets, and make an 
excellent pie, or a savory stew, thus: 

115. Stewed Giblets.— Having scalded and picked them, cut them 
in pieces, wash them clean, and put them into a saucepan with a 
piece of scrag of veal, cover them with water, and let them boil 
up, then take off the scum quite clean, and add three onions, two 
turnips, one carrot, and a little thyme and parsley. Stew them 
till they are tender, and strain them through a sieve ; wash the 
giblets clean from the herbs, etc. Now take a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut, put it into a saucepan with a large spoonful 
of flour, and stir it about till it is well mixed and smooth ; then 
put in the broth and giblets, stew them for a quarter of an hour. 



30 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



season with salt and a little pepper, and just before you serv& 
them up, chop a handful of green parsley, and put it in. Give it 
a boil up, and serve them in a tureen. 

116. To Roast Ducks.— Pick, draw, and singe them. Cut off 
the head ; dip the feet in boiling water to remove the yellow skin ; 
truss them plump, turning the feet flat upon the back. Stuff the 
same as goose, and serve with gravy and apple-sauce. An hour 
will roast a duck. Green peas usually accompany roast duck. 

117. To Roast Pigeons. — Pick, draw, and truss them, keeping 
on the feet. Chop the liver with some parsley, add crumbs of 
bread, pepper, salt, and a little butter; put this stuffing inside. 
Slit one of the legs, and slip the other through it; skewer and 
roast them for half an hour; baste them well with butter. Serve 
with brown gravy in a boat, and bread-sauce. 

118. To Roast Pheasants. — Pick, singe, and draw them, the same 
as fowls. Truss them by twisting the head round one of the wings, 
and turning both wings on the back. Fix the legs down straight, 
the same as a roast fowl; the feet are to be left on. Paper them 
all over the breast, and roast them to a fine brown. Just before 
they are done, remove the paper and brown the breast; flour and 
baste them with a little butter, and let them have a fine white 
froth. They will be done in three-quarters of an hour. Take 
them up and pour good gravy into the dish. Serve with bread- 
sauce. 

119. To Roast Partridges. — Pick, draw, singe, and clean them 
the same as fowls. Make a slit in the neck and draw out the 
craw; twist the neck round the wing, and bring the head round 
to the side of the breast. The legs and wings are trussed the 
same as fowls, only the feet are left on and crossed over one an- 
other. Put them down to a clear fire, and baste well with butter. 
When about half done, dust a little flour over them ; let them be 
nicely browned. They will require to roast from twenty minutes 
to half an hour each. Serve on toasted bread dipped in the gravy, 
with gravy and bread-sauce. 

120. Grouse and Blackcock should be dressed and served in the 
same manner, only the head should be trussed under the wing. 

121. To Roast Snipes or Woodcocks. — These are not drawn. 
Spit them on a small bird-spit, flour and baste them with a 
piece of butter, lay a slice of bread toasted brown in the dish, and 
set it under the snipes for the trail to drop on. When they are 
done enough take them up and lay them on a toast. Have ready, 
for two snipes, a quarter of a pint of good gravy and butter; pour 
it into a dish, and set it over a chafing-dish for a few minutes. 
Garnish with lemon. 

122. To Roast a Hare.— Cut off the feet and draw off the skin, 
commencing at the hind legs, and proceeding along the body to 
the head, taking care not to tear the ears in skinning them. Soak 
it well and wash it in several waters; then wipe it quite dry; 
make a stuffing with crumbs of bread, parsley, and beef suet 
chopped fine, a little grated lemon-peel and nutmeg, a piece of the 
liver boiled and chopped fine, and pepper and salt; moisten the 
whole with an egg, a little milk, and a spoonful of catsup. Put 
this pudding into the belly, and sew up the skin. Commence 



81

trussing by placing the hind and fore legs flat against the sides. 
The under-sinews must be cut to make the hind legs lie flat. The 
head must be fixed between the shoulders on the back by running- 
a skewer through it into the body. Suspend it head downwards. 
Baste it with butter, flouring it lightly. It will require from an 
hour and a half to two hours. The hare is served lying on its 
belly, with rich beef gravy and a dish of currant -jelly. 

133. To Roast a Rabbit— Having drawn and skinned it, wash 
it in warrn water, dry it, truss it, and stuff it as follows: Beef 
suet chopped fine; a few bread-crumbs; a little thyme, marjoram, 
and savory; a little grated lemon-peel, pepper, and salt, mixed 
together with an egg; put it into the belly of the rabbit and sew it 
up. Suspend it before a good fire, and do not put it too close at 
first; baste it well with butter or veal dripping, and dredge it two 
or three times with flour. When it is sufficiently roasted place 
the rabbit in a hot dish; put a little water into a saucepan, a lump 
of butter rolled in flour, and pour the gravy in from the dripping- 
pan; give it aboil up, and pour it over the rabbit. 

124. A Batter for Roast Hare. — Make a batter as for pancakes, 
but not quite so thick, with two spoonfuls of flour and two of 
salad-oil ; add three yolks and one white of egg ; mix all together 
with new milk and a little salt ; baste the hare with it when half 
roasted. 

135. To Jug a Hare. — Skin, draw, and wash the hare; cut it 
into pieces and put them into a jar with an onion, a bunch of 
sweet herbs, and a little water. Cover the top of the jar close, so 
that very little of the steam can escape ; place the jar in a saucepan 
of water not sufficiently high to cover the top; keep the water 
constantly boiling between three and four hours. When done, 
skim off the fat, thicken the sauce with flour and butter; season 
with pepper and salt, and serve it all together in a hash-dish. 

136. To Boil a Turkey.— A boiled turkey is a most delicate and 
excellent dish, and requires to be dressed with extreme care. Clean 
the turkey from feathers and stumps, and singe off the hairs, 
taking care not to blacken the skin. Draw and wipe it inside 
with a clean dry cloth ; cut off the legs at the first joint : draw out 
the sinews; then pull down the skin and push the legs inside; cut 
the head off close to the body, leaving the skin long, and draw out 
the craw. Make a good veal stuffing and put it into the breast^ 
leaving sufficient room for the stuffing to swell ; then draw the 
skin of the breast over the opening and sew it neatly across the 
back, so that when the turkey is brought to table no sewing will 
appear. Place the gizzard in one wing and the liver in the other, 
turn the wings on the back and fix them to the sides with a 
skewer ; wrap it in a cloth dredged with flour, and put it into a 
pot of warm water, in sufficient quantity to keep the turkey al- 
ways covered. Skim it while boiling. A small, young turkey 
will not take more than an hour and a half to boil it; a large one 
about two hours and a half. When done place it in a hot dish, and 
pour a little sauce over the breast. Send up oyster-sauce, or pars- 
ley and butter, in a tureen. Some cooks make the stuffing of 
chopped bread and butter, oysters, cream, and the yolks of eggs. 

127. 2b Boil a Fowl. — A fowl is prepared for boiling just the 



32 

DOMESTIC COOKERY 



same as a turkey, onl y omit the stuffing. It may be boiled with- 
out a cloth; the liquor will then be good. A small fowl will re- 
quire from half an hour to three-quarters, a large one from an 
hour to an hour and a half. Sauce, parsley and butter. 

128. To Boil Rabbits. — Wash them well in warm water; truss 
them like roast hare, and boil them for an hour ; pour over them 
a sauce made of boiled onions chopped in melted butter, seasoned 
with pepper and salt, adding a little milk or cream. 

129. To Boil Pigeons. — Boil them by themselves for a quarter of 
an hour; then boil a handsome square piece of bacon, and lay it 
in the middle of the dish ; stew spinach to lay round, and put the 
pigeons on the spinach. Garnish with slices of bacon, and send 
up melted butter in a boat. 



TO DRESS FISH. 

General Remarks. — Fish must be put into cold or boiling 
water according to its firmness of flesh: for instance, turbot sal-, 
mon, mackerel, &c, should be put into cold water; while plaice, 
whitings, haddocks, and such soft-fleshed as well as crimped fish, 
should be put into boiling water. The reason is obvious : by put- 
ting flaccid and watery fish into the water cold, it is rendered 
still more soft and watery- but the boiling water sets it and 
renders it firmer; on the other hand, the cold water penetrates 
and softens the fish that is of a firmer texture, and makes it 
eat more tender and delicate. Keep the water skimmed while 
the fish is boiling. 

Fish is cooked enough when it leaves the bone easily. Be 
sure to wash and clean your fish well, never trusting to the 
fishmonger. 

In frying fish, having washed it, dry it thoroughly in a clean 
cloth, then flour it well, or whisk it over with egg, and dip* it 
into bread-crumbs before frying it. Be sure your pan is very 
clean, and that your fat (of which there should be enough to 
cover the fish) boils before you put the fish in. Fry fish quickly 
of a fine light brown. Some like fish fried in batter — as good a 
batter as any is a little ale and flour beaten up just as you are 
ready for it — then dip the fish in before frying it. Put plenty of 
salt in the water in which you boil fish, and a stick of horseradish 
excepting mackerel, with which you boil salt, mint, parsley, and 
fennel. 

130. To Boil Turbot. — Lay it in plenty of salt and water for an 
hour. In the meantime set on a nsh-kettle with spring water and 
salt, and a piece of horseradish. Lay the turbot on a fish-plate, 
with the belly upwards, and put it in the kettle; let it be 
well boiled through, but not overdone; it will require from 
half an hour to three-quarters after it boils; according to the 
thickness. It should boil slowly. When it is done enough, take 
off the fish-kettle ; set it before the fire, then carefully lift up the 
fish-plate, and set it across the kettle to drain; during which, melt 
a great deal of fresh butter, and bruise in the spawn of one or two 
lobsters, and the meat cut small, with a spoonful of anchovy- 



33 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



liquor, then give it a boil and pour it into boats. Now lay the 
turbot in the dish, and garnish with scraped horseradish and 
lemon. 

181. To Boil Salmon. — Clean out and scale the fish, and rinse it 
in water. Then put on a good room}' fish-kettle with plenty of 
water and a good handful of salt; put in your fish, let it 
boil very gently, keeping it skimmed. The time it will take de- 
pends greatly ou the thickness of the fish. It is usual to reckon 
ten minutes to the pound. To ascertain if it be boiled enough, 
raise one end from the water, and if a knife pass easily betwixt 
the fish and the bone, it is sufficiently done. When it is ready, 
lift the drainer out of the water and set it across the kettle, 
that the water may drip from the fish. Serve it on a dish with a 
fish-plate ; lay a napkin under the fish. Garnish with green par- 
sley and lobster or shrimp sauce. 

133. To Boil Cod. — wash and clean it well, boil it the same as 
directed for turbot. Serve it on a napkin. Garnish with parsley 
and horseradish scraped. Oyster-sauce. 

183. To Dress a Cod's Head and Shoulders. — Clean a cod's head 
and shoulders in one piece, and lay it in salt all night. Before you 
dress it, bind it firmly together with tape. Put it into a fish- 
kettle with plenty of cold water, a handful of salt, and a stick of 
horseradish. Let it boil slowly for about three-quarters of an hour, 
then let the water drain from it across the top of the kettle. 
Place it on a hot dish, back upwards, and draw away the tapes 
very carefully. Brush it over with beaten egg and stew over it 
bread-crumbs, pepper and salt ; then stick pieces of butter thickly 
over the top. Set it before the fire, which should be clear and 
brisk, to brown. Make a rich oyster-sauce with gravy well sea- 
soned with cayenne pepper, salt, and catsup, and pour it into the 
dish, around but not over the fish. 

134. To Stetv Cod. — Cut it in slices an inch thick, lay them in a 
large stewpan, season with nutmeg beaten, pepper, and salt, a bun- 
dle of sweet herbs, an onion, half a pint of wine, and a quarter of a 
pint of water ; cover close, and let it simmer softly for five or six 
minutes; then squeeze in the juice of a lemon, put in a few oysters, 
and the liquor strained, with a blade or two of mace ; cover it close 
and let it stew softly, shaking the pan often. When it is done 
enough take out the sweet herbs and onion, and dish it up; pour the 
sauce over it, and garnish with lemon. 

135. To Boil Shell-Fish. — Lobsters and craw-fish must be put 
alive in boiling water. When the joints come off easily they are 
done enough. 

Crabs must be first killed, and then put into lwiling water. 

136. To Fry Haddocks.— These are most excellent fish when 
properly dressed. Take good- sized haddocks; wash and clean 
them well: let them lie all night in salt. When you are going to 
dress them, wash and wipe them dry ; cut off the head, tail, and 
fins; skin them carefully, so as not to tear the flesh, which is ex- 
tremely tender ; cut the flesh from the bone and divide each side 
in two pieces; dredge them with flour, dip them in egg and 
bread-crumbs, and fry them in hot lard or dripping sufficient to 
cover them, Do not suffer the fat to scorch the fish. Brown both. 



3i 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



sides; and when done, place them for a few minutes on a drainer, 
before the fire. Garnish with parsley. Send up oyster-sauce, or 
plain melted butter, in a boat. 

137. To Broil Haddocks. — Scale, gut, and wash them clean. Do 
not rip open the bellies, but take out the guts with the gills; dry 
them in a clean cloth; and if there be any roe or liver, take it out, 
wash and dry it, and put it in again; flour them well, and have a 
clear, brisk fire. Clean your gridiron and let it get hot ; then lay 
on your fish; turn them two or three times at first to keep them 
from sticking; then let one side be done enough, and turn it on 
the other. When done, lay them in a dish, and serve them with 
plain melted butter or anchovy-sauce. They are nice eating if 
salted a day or two before you dress them, and hung up to dry, 
or plain-boiled with egg-sauce. 

138. To Cook Dried Haddock. — Take a frying pan or sauce-pan, 
and fill it with sufficient water to cover the haddock, and directly 
the water boils, place the fish in it for two or three minutes, ac- 
cording to its size. The haddock should then be skinned, buttered, 
and placed before the fire for a few minutes, when it is ready to 
serve. 

139. Baked Fish. — Cod, gurnet, and shad are good for baking. 
Stuff them with a seasoning made of bread-crumbs, butter, salt, 
pepper, and (if agreeable) parsley and spices. Put the fish in a 
baking-dish, with a cupful of water and a lump of butter. Bake 
from three quarters of an hour to an hour. 

140. To Broil Mackerel. — Cut off the heads, but do not rip them 
open; gut, and wash them clean, and dry them; pull out the roe 
at the neck end, boil it, then bruise it with a spoon; beat up the 
yolk of an egg with a little nutmeg, a little dropped lemon-peel, a 
little thyme, some boiled parsley chopped fine, a little pepper and 
salt, and a few bread-crumbs; mix these together with the mashed 
roe, and fill the mackerel; flour it, and broil it nicely. Send it rp 
with a little catsup or walnut-pickle, in plain melted butter. 
Mackerel, if boiled, should be put into cold water with plenty of 
salt. When cold they are nice soused in vinegar. 

141. To Dress Flat-fish. — In dressing all sorts of flat-fish take 
great care, if you boil them, to have them done enough, but do 
not let them break. Put plenty of salt in the water, also horse- 
radish; let the fish be well drained, and cut off the fins when 
cleaning them. When to be fried, let them be well dried in a 
cloth; egg and bread-crumb them, and fry them of a light brown; 
use plenty of fat; and, when done, drain the fish on a clean coarse 
cloth. If to be fried without egg and bread-crumbs, proceed as 
for sausages. 

142. To Broil Herrings.— Scale and gut them; cut off the heads; 
wash them clean, and dry them in a cloth; flour and broil them; 
mash the heads; boil them in small beer or ale, with a little whole 
pepper and an onion ; let it boil for a quarter of an hour ; strain 
it ; then thicken it with butter and flour and a good deal of mus- 
tard. Lay the herrings on a dish and pour the sauce into a 
boat. 

143. To Fry Herrings. — Gut and wash them clean, and dry 
them in a cloth; fry tbem brown; have ready some onions sliced 



35 

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



thin; fry them of a light brown, with the herrings; lay the her- 
rings in a dish, and the onions round, with butter and mustard in 
a cup. Dress them on a quick fire. 

144. To Stew Eels.— Clean them thoroughly, which will take 
plenty of water, time, and trouble ; cut them in pieces of about 
three inches in length : put them into a saucepan with barely suf- 
ficient water to cover them, a blade or two of mace, and a crust 
of bread ; let them stew gently till the flesh will strip easily from 
the bone; then put in a lump of butter rolled in flour, some pars- 
ley chopped fine, and a little pepper and salt ; let it boil up once 
or twice, and serve them hot in a tureen with toasted snippets. 

145. To Broil Eels. — Take a large eel ; skin and make it clean: 
then open the belly, and cut it into four pieces. Then take the 
tail-end, strip off the flesh, and beat it in a mortar; season with a 
little beaten mace, grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, chopped pars- 
ley, thyme, lemon peel, and bread-crumbs; roll it in a piece of 
butter; then mix it again with the yolk of an egg ; roll it up, and 
fill the pieces of belly with it ; now cut the skin of the eel, wrap it 
round the pieces, and sew them up; broil them well; have butter 
and an anchovy for sauce, with the juice of a lemon. 

146. To Boil Soles.— Take three quarts of ' spring- water and a 
handful of salt. When it boils put in the soles, and let them 
boil gently for ten minutes. Dish them up in a clean napkin, 
with anchovy or shrimp sauce. 

147. To Fry Soles. — Scrape, but do not skin them; wash them 
and wipe them dry; dip them in beaten egg, and then strew them 
over with bread-crumbs ; have a pan of fat, and be sure it boils 
before you put in the soles. Fry them of a light brown and turn 
them but once. Lay them on a napkin for the fat to drain off, 
and serve them on a fish-plate, with plain melted butter in a 
boat. 

148. To Stew 3Iiissels. — Wash them very clean from the sand, in 
two or three waters, put them into a saucepan, cover them close, 
and let them stew till all the shells open; then take them out, pick 
them out of the shells, and pick out the bit of weed which is usually 
sticking under the tongue. When } r ou have picked them all clean 
put them into a clean saucepan, and to a quart of mussels strain 
half a pint of the liquor through a sieve; then put in a blade or 
two of mace, and a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, rolled in 
flour. Let them stew; then toast some bread, cut it in three- 
cornered pieces/and lay it round the dish. Pour in the mussels, 
and send them to table hot. 

149. To Scollop Ousters. — Rub some bread-crumbs in a clean 
cloth; fill your scollop-shells with oysters and the bread-crumbs 
alternately. Set them before a good fire to brown, add a little 
popper and salt, baste them well with butter, and keep turning 
them, that they may be brown all over alike. 

150. To Dress Salt Fish. — Soak it for some hours, to take out 
the salt, changing the water frequently. Put it into cold water. 
It will take from ten to twenty minutes after it boils, according 
to the thickness of the fish. Serve it with boiled parsnips, and 
egg-sauce in a boat.

PIES AND PUDDINGS. 

General Rules.— In boiling puddings mind that the cloth be 
perfectly clean. Dip it in hot water, and dredge it well with 
flour. If a bread pudding, tie it loose; if a batter-pudding, tie it 
nearly close ; apple and gooseberry puddings, &c, should be tied 
quite close. When you make a batter pudding first mix the flour 
well with milk, and stir in the other ingredients by degrees; you 
will then have it smooth, without lumps. The best way, how- 
ever, for a plain batter-pudding, is to strain it through a coarse 
hair-sieve, that it may have neither lumps nor the treadings of 
the eggs ; and for all other puddings strain the eggs when they aro 
beaten up. Be sure the water boils when you put your pudding 
in, and that it keeps boiling all the time, and that you keep it 
always covered with water ; you should also move it about two or 
three times at first, or it may stick to the pot; dip the pudding into 
cold water immediately you take it out, which prevents it stick- 
ing. If you boil your pudding in a dish or basin, butter the inside 
before putting the pudding in ; the same should be done to the dish 
for a baked pudding or pie. 

The quality of pie crust depends much on the baking. If the 
oven be too hot, the paste, besides being burned, will fall ; if too 
slack, it will be soddened, and consequently heavy. 

Paste should be made on a cold, smooth substance, such as 
marble or slate, with a light, cool hand. It should be made quick- 
ly ; much handling makes it heavy. Great nicety is required in 
wetting the paste; too little moisture rendering it dry and 
crumbly, while too much makes it tough and heavy; and in either 
case the paste cannot be easily worked. Practice alone can pro- 
duce perfection in this art. 

Before commencing to make paste for pies or puddings it is 
necessary to place near at hand everything likely to be wanted, 
to inspect all the utensils, to prepare all the ingredients, and, 
though last, not least, to wash the hands and nails perfectly clean: 
for the hands are the best tools to make paste with. 

Always use good sweet butter, dripping, or lard for pie or pud- 
ding crust. Some persons entertain the mistaken notion that 
butter which cannot be eaten on bread will do very well for paste; 
on the contrary, the baking or boiling of rancid fat increases the 
bad flavor. It is a good plan to wash the butter in clean spring- 
water before using it. Make two or three holes with a fork in the 
cover of your pies, that the steam may escape. 

151. Puff-paste.— Rub a quarter of a pound of butter- into half 
a quartern of flour very fine ; make it up into a light paste, using 
as little cold water as you can work it up with; then roll it out 
about a quarter of an inch thick, put a layer of butter all over, 
sprinkle on a little flour, double it up and roll it out again; double 
and roll it out thus four or five times, using another half-pound of 
butter ; then it will be fit for any pies or tarts that require puff- 
paste. 

152. Crust for Raised Pies. — Boil a quarter of a pound of lard 
in half a pint of water. This will bind two pounds of flour, on 
which it must be poured boiling. When well mixed, knead it on 
the paste-board with your hands till it becomes stiff like dough. 



37 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



Cut off a piece first to form the cover, and model the rest like a 
dish or basin to hold the meat. When you put on the cover, wet 
the edges and press them tightly together. 

153. Rhubarb, Gooseberry, Plum, and Currant Pie. — Make a 
good crust ; lay a little round the sides of the dish ; throw some 
sugar on the bottom, and put in a little cup to suck in the juice; 
lay in the fruit, and put some more sugar at top; then put in a 
very little water ; wet the top of the crust that goes round inside 
the dish ; put on the cover, and pinch the edges together. Cut the 
rhubarb into lengths of two inches, but do not skin it; only trim 
it at top and bottom. 

154. Apple Pic. — Make a puff- paste crust; lay some round the 
sides of the dish ; pare and quarter the apples, and take out the 
cores; lay a row of apples thick at the bottom of the dish, with 
half the sugar you intend for the pie, a little minced lemon- peel, a 
little of the juice, and two or three cloves, or a little cinnamon ; 
then the rest of the apples and sugar; squeeze in a little more 
lemon-juice, and have ready the peels and cores of the apples 
boiled with some sugar in very little water and strained; pour the 
liquor into the pie, and put on the upper crust. It should be baked 
very pale. Put no cup in the dish when you make apple-pie. The 
flavor of a quince will greatly improve it. 

155. — Open Tarts. — Line your dishes with thin, light paste, fill 
in with preserved fruits or jam, and lay strips of paste across in 
squares or diamonds. A short time will bake them. 

156. Mince Pies. — Take equal weights of tender roast beef, suet, 
currants, raisins, and apples which have been previously pared 1 
and cored, with half their weight of soft sugar, one ounce of 
powdered cinnamon, an equal quantity of candied orange and 
lemon peel and citron, a little salt, and twelve bitter almonds- 
blanched and grated. Chop the meat and the suet separately; 
wash and pick the currants, stone the raisins and chop them withe 
thepeel; and having minced all the ingredients very fine, mix 
them together, adding a nutmeg grated and the juice of a lemon. 
A glass or two of wine or spirit greatly improves it. Line your 
dish or patty -pans with puff-paste; fill with the mince, cover and 
pinch the edges together, iiake half an hour. Many persons 
make the mince without meat. 

157. Christmas Pudding. — Cover the bottom of a baking-dish 
with very thin slices of stale bread-and-butter, with the crust cut 
off; strew it over thickly with mincemeat, then put another layer 
of bread-and-butter, cover this again with mincemeat, and so -on 
till your dish is full ; pour a good thick custard over all, and bake 
it for an hour, or an hour and a half, according to the size. 

158. Pigeon Pie. — Make a puff- paste crust; cover the dish; let 
the pigeons be very nicely picked and cleaned ; season them with 
pepper and salt, and put a good piece of fresh butter with pepper 
and salt in their bellies; lay them in the dish, the necks, gizzards, 
livers, pinions and hearts, place between, with the yolk of a hard- 
boiled egg and a beefsteak in the middle ; put in as much water as 
will almost fill the dish, lay on the top crust and bake it well. It 
is a great improvement to stuff the pigeons with forcemeat, very 
highly seasoned, and to lay forcemeat-balls round inside the dish.

159. Meat and Potato Pie. — Mash some potatoes with pepper 
and salt and milk, and line a baking-dish with the same: lay on 
slices of cold meat of any kind, with salt, pepper, butter, and cat- 
sup; lay on more potatoes, then more meat, then another layer of 
potatoes on the top. Bake it till it is quite hot through. 

160. Giblet Pie. — Take two sets of giblets nicely cleaned, put all 
but the livers into a saucepan, with two quarts of water, twenty 
corns of whole pepper, three blades of mace, a large onion and a 
bunch of sweet herbs; cover close, and stew them till they are 
tender; then have a good crust read y, cover the dish, lay a fine 
lumpsteak at the bottom, seasoned with pepper and salt; lay in 
the giblets with the livers, and strain the liquor in which they 
were stewed ; season it with pepper and salt and pour it into the 
pie ; put on the top crust, and bake it an hour and a half. 

161. Eel Pie. — Make a good' crust; clean, gut and wash the eels 
well, cut them in pieces as for stewing; season them with pepper 
and salt and a little beaten mace, according to j T our taste. Line 
the sides of your dish with crust, fill in the eels, and put as much 
water as the dish will hold, with a tablespoonful of catsup; put 
on the cover and bake it well. 

162. Directions for Cleansing Dried Currants and other Fruit. — 
Put them into warm, not hot water; rub them thoroughly, take 
them out of the water into a sieve, leaving the sediment behind 
in the pan. Set the sieve in a pan of water, rub the currants 
well about in the sieve, changing the water till all the dirt is re- 
moved; let them drain, then dry them in a clean cloth and pick 
out all the refuse and stones, after which spread them on a large 
dish, and let them stand in the sun, or at a good distance from the 
fire, to dry and swell. Pack them in a jar for use. 

Red and black currants should be held by the stalks, and dipped 
into a basin of water to remove the dust, then stripped into a dish. 
Cherries should be stalked and wiped, gooseberries should be 
picked and washed; strawberries, raspberries, etc., do not require 
to be washed, but merely to have the stalks taken off, raisins 
should be stoned and chopped; apples require to be cored and sliced. 

163. Cherry, Gooseberry, or Currant and Rasp)berii~y Pudding. — 
Make a good crust, and line a pudding-basin, previously buttered, 
with it; pick j^our fruit and fill the basin; put in a very little 
water and some sugar, wet the edge of the paste all round, then 
cover tbe top with a crust and pinch the edges together; tie a 
cloth tightly over, and boil the pudding for an hour and a half, 
or two hours, according to its size. When you take it out of the 
pot dip the basin into cold water, then turn the pudding out on to 
a dish. 

164. Boiled Apple Pudding. — Make a good paste, roll it out 
half an inch thick, but quite thin round the edge; pare and core 
apples sufficient to fill the crust* close it up, tie it up tight in a 
cloth, and boil it from two to three hours, according to the size. 
When it is done, turn it into a dish, cut a piece of crust out of the 
top, put in a good lump of butter, and as much sugar as will 
sweeten it to your taste, a little grated lemon-peel, and one drop 
of oil of cinnamon; stir it well in the pudding, lay on the crust, 
and send it to table hot.

165. Rich Baked Apple Pudding.— Pave twelve large apples, 
rake out the cores, and put them into a saucepan with four or five 
spoonfuls of water; boil them till they are soft and thick; beat 
them well, and stir in a pound of loaf-sugar, the juice of three 
lemons, the peel of two lemons cut thin and beat fine in a mortar, 
two drops of oil of cinnamon, and the yolks of eight eggs beaten 
up ; mix all together ; put it in a puff paste, to bake it. When it 
is nearly done throw over it a little grated loaf-sugar. 

166. Apple Dumplings. — Make a good paste, pare some large 
apples, cut them in quarters, take out the cores, and in place of 
them put in a clove and a piece of lemon-peel cut very thin; 
take a piece of crust enough for one apple, roll it round, put the 
quarters together, and roll the crust round it with a little flour 
in your hand. Have a pot of water boiling, take a clean cloth, 
dip it into the water, shake flour over it, and tie each dumpling 
by itself, put them in, and keep the water boiling all the time; if 
the apples be not large, half an hour will boil them. When they 
are done enough take them up, lay them on a dish, throw fine 
sugar over them, and send them to table with fresh melted butter 
in a boat and fiae-beaten sugar in a saucer. 

167. Plain Suet Pudding.— Chop a quarter of a pound of suet 
very fine, and mix it with half a pound of flour, a few bread- 
crumbs, and a little salt; when mixed together make it into a 
paste with a little water, not too stiff, dip your cloth into hot 
water, flour it, and tie up the pudding tight; put it into a sauce- 
pan of boiling water, and let it boil for an hour and a half. This 
is made richer by adding a couple of eggs, and using milk instead of 
water. 

168. Currant Dumplings.— Pick and wash a pound of currants, 
dry them, and lay them on a plate before the fire. Chop a pound 
of suet very small, and put it into eight spoonfuls of flour, with 
two teaspoon fuls of salt, and three of ginger; now add the cur- 
rants, and mix all well together ; then beat up four eggs with a pint 
of milk; add this by degrees to the other ingredients, and make it 
into a light paste ; roll it up into balls as large as a turkey's egg, 
with a little flour; flatten them a little and put them into boiling 
water; move them gently, that they may not stick together. Half 
an hour will boil them. 

169. Yorkshire Pudding.— Mix up a quart of milk, four eggs, 
ami a little salt, into a thick batter with flour, as for pancakes. 
Have a good piece of meat roasting at the fire; put a lump of 
dripping into a stewpan, and set it on the fire; when the fat boils ^ 
pour in the pudding; let it bake till nearly done, then take away 
the dripping-pan and set the stewpan under the meat, that the 
gravy and dripping may drop on the pudding, and the heat of the 
fire may reach it and make it brown. When the meat is done, 
drain the fat from the pudding, slide it as dry as possible into a 
dish, and serve it up with the meat. 

170. Currant Bolster Pudding. — Make a good paste, and roll it 
out very thin; have ready some currants well picked and washed, 
which strew pretty thickly all over the paste, roll it up, scald and 
four your cloth, and roll the pudding in it; after which tie the 
cloth tightly at each end, put it into boiling water, and let it boil 



40

of a pound of candied orange and lemon peel, an ounce of pow- 
dere 1 cinnamon, half an ounce of ground ginger, a nutmeg grated, 
twelve bitter almonds blanched and grated; and a little salt; mix 
these well together; then beat up seven eggs, strain them through

into the other ingredients; make it thick, but not too stiff. Just 
bef ore you are going to boil it stir into it a glass of rum or brandy, 
scald a cloth, flour it, and lay it in a basin; pour in your pudding; 
then have ready another cloth, also scalded and floured, which 
lay over the top, tie it round tightly, and put it in boiling water, 
of which there should be abundance, as well as plenty of room. 
Keep it boiling for six or seven hours. When it is done take it 
out of the pot, let it stand a few minutes to cool, or dip it into 
cold water; then turn it out into a dish, and serve it with caudle- 
sauce. A plain pudding may be made by using less fruit and 
spices. 

172. Bread Pudding. — Crumble down stale bread in a dish; 
boil sufficient milk, which pour on the bread. Cover it up for a 
quarter of an hour, that the bread may swell; then beat it up to a 
fine pulp, stirring in a lump of butter. Now beat up three or four 
eggs, ground cinnamon, gingev, grated lemon-peel, and sugar to 
taste; half a pound of raisins stoned and chopped; half a pound 
of currants picked and washed; with a little salt. Mix this 
among the bread; make it of the consistence of thick batter. 
Butter the dish, pour it in, and bake it for half an hour. 

173. Bread and Butter Pudding. — Cut some slices of thin bread 
and butter, and have ready some currants picked and washed. 
Butter a dish, and lay slices of the bread and butter on the bot- 
tom of it; then stew some currants over them, then lay another 
row of bread and butter, then some more currants, until the dish 
be full. Then beat up four eggs, add a pint of new milk, a little 
ground cinnamon, nutmeg, grated lemon-peel, four or five bitter 
almonds blanched and crushed, and sugar to your taste ; also a 
very little salt. Mix all these together, and pour them over the 
bread and butter. Bake it half an hour. 

174. Hard Dumplings. — Make a stiff paste of flour and water 
with a little salt. Boil them with salt beef or pickled pork. 

175. Custard Pudding. — Beat up six eggs, add a quart of new 
milk, a little lomompeel shred fine, five or six bitter almonds 
blanched and grated or crushed, with sugar to your taste; mix all 
together; then have ready your dish covered 'with a good puff- 
paste, into which pour the custard; grate over it half a nutmeg, 
and bake it; or put it into a basin without paste, tie a cloth over 
it, and boil it. If boiled, serve it with melted butter. 

..• 170. Boiled Bice Pudding. — Pick and wash your rice, put it into 
a clean saucepan with plenty of water, but without a cloth; let it 
boil till the grains are swelled and soft, which they will be in 



il 

DOMESTIC COOKERY.

set the saucepan on the hob, that the rice may be perfectly dry; 
put it into a buttered mould or basin to set ; then turn it out, and 
pour sweet sauce over it. 

177. Baked Rice Pudding. — Boil a quarter of a pound of rice in 
a quart of new milk, and stir it that it may not burn ; when it be- 
gins to thicken take it off, let it stand till cool, then stir in a lump 
of butter, sugar to your palate, and some grated nutmeg; butter 
the dish, pour it in, and bake it. Raisins, currants, or sliced 
apples may be stirred in if liked. 

178. Rich Rice Pudding.— Tick and wash a quarter of a pound 
of rice; put it on in cold water, and let it boil for five minutes, 
then strain the water off and put the rice on again in as much new 
milk as it will require to boil it quite soft, with a good pinch of 
salt; stir it frequently to prevent it burning; when done, put it in 
a large basin to cool. Beat up six eggs, a pint of milk, and sugar 
to your taste; it should be rather too sweet when you make it, as 
the sweetness goes off in the baking; add also five or six bitter 
almonds blanched and crushed, with plenty of lemon-peel chopped 
very fine ; mix all well together, then stir it into the rice, taking- 
care to mix it thoroughly, so that there be no lumps. Butter your 
dish, and pour in the mixture; and then shred about two ounces 
of beef suet as finely as possible all over the top* grate over that 
half a nutmeg, and bake it half an hour in a moderate oven. 

179. Tapioca Pudding.— Take six tablespoon fuls of tapioca, and 
soak it in milk for some hours before you intend to use it ; when 
you are going to make your pudding, put the tapioca into a quart 
of milk, place it on the fire, and, as soon as it boils, sweeten it to 
your taste, and let it simmer for a quarter of an hour; be very- 
careful that it does not burn to the pot. Pour it into a basin, and 
stir into it a little fresh butter and three eggs beaten; butter your 
dish, pour it in, and bake it for an hour. If you wish it boiled, 
you must add another egg and boil it for an hour and a half. 
Sago-pudding may be made the same way. 

180. Yeast Dumplings. — Make a light dough, as for bread, with 
flour, water, salt, and yeast; cover it with a cloth, and set it be- 
fore the fire for half an hour; then have a saucepan of boiling 
water, make the dough into round balls, the size of a hen's egg, 
and put them in. Ten minutes will boil them ; be sure to keep the 
water boiling all the time, or thej r will sink and be heavy. When 
they are done enough, which they will be in rather less than ten 
minutes, take them out with a slice, put them into a hot dish, and 
send up melted butter and sugar in a boat. 

181. Lemon Pudding.— Take the yolks of six eggs well beaten, 
with a quarter of a pound of sugar ; take a quarter of a pound of 
butter melted in as little water as possible; be careful not to oil 
it; keep stirring it till cold; then mix all together with the juice 
of two lemons, and the peel grated in. Cover your dish with a 
thin puff-pasteppour in the mixture, and bake it for half an hour. 

182. Snow-balls. — Swell rice in milk; strain it, and lay it round 
some apples, previously pared and cored; put a bit of cinnamon. 
lemon-peel, and a clove in each, then tie them in a cloth and boil 
them well; they are eaten with melted butter and sugar.

183. Batter Pudding. — Beat up six eggs, take a quart of milk, 
.six spoonfuls of flour, eight bitter almonds blanched and grated, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and one of ground ginger; mix all together, 
butter your basin, and pour it in ; tie a cloth over it and boil it an 
hour and a quarter. When it is done, turn it into a dish and pour 
melted butter and sugar over it. 

184. Batter Pudding without Eggs. — Use a quart of milk, mix 
six spoonfuls of flour with a little of the milk first, add the rest by 
degrees, with a teaspoonful of salt, two of beaten ginger, and two 
of the tincture of saffron; mix all together quite smooth, and boil 
it for an hour either in a buttered cloth or basin. 

185. Pleas Pudding. — Pick and well wash the best split peas, tie 
them loosely in a cloth, and let them boil for two or three hours, 
untie the cloth, and mash the peas with a wooden spoon till quiter 
smooth ; put in a good lump of butter, and pepper and salt, tie up 
the pudding again, and boil it for another half hour. It is then 
ready. 

186. Norfolk Dumplings. — Take half a pint of milk, two eggs, 
and a little salt; make it into a batter with flour. Have ready a 
clean saucepan of boiling water, into which drop the batter. Let 
the water boil fast, and two or three minutes will boil them 
enough ; then throw them into a sieve to drain the water from 
them, turn them into a dish, and stir a lump of butter among 
them. Eat them hot. 

187. Curate, or Sponge-Puddiyig. — Beat up two eggs with their 
weight in flour, in good fresh butter and in pounded sugar; add 
two drops of essence of lemon; when well mixed pour it into four 
tea-cups, previously well buttered, and bake in a moderatel}' - quick 
oven. To be served with wine-sauce in a boat, not poured over the 
puddings. This dish is fit for any table; it is quickly and easily 
made, and if not eaten as pudding* with sauce, is exceedingly good 
as cake when cold. 

188. Cabinet Pudding. — Over six sponge-cakes pour sufficient 
sherry to soak them thoroughly; meanwhile beat up six new-laid 
eggs with a quart of new milk, sweetening with pounded loaf 
sugar. Put your cakes into the custard without beating them to- 
gether, and turn the whole into a mould or basin, previously well 
buttered; tie a paper over the top, and steam the pudding for an 
hour. For sauce, beat up the yolks of eggs and sherry ; heat them 
over the fire, not allowing them to boil, but keep whisking them 
all the time. Pour this over the pudding. 

189. Pancakes. — Beat up three eggs and a quart of milk; make it 
up into a batter with flour, a little salt, a spoonful of ground 
ginger, and a little grated lemon-peel; let it be of a fine thickness 
and perfectly smooth. Clean your frying pan thoroughly, and put 
into it a good lump of dripping or butter; when it is hot pour in 
a cupful of batter, and let it run all over of an equal thickness; 
shake the pan frequently, that the batter may not stick, and when 
you think it is done on one side toss it over ; if you cannot, turn 
it with a slice ; and when both sides are of a nice light brown, lay 
it on a dish before the fire ; strew sugar over it, and so do the rest. 
They should be eaten directly, or they will become heavy. 

190. Fruit Fritters. — Make a batter of flour, milk, and eggs, of 



43 



DOMES* ;C COOKERY. 



whatever richness you desire; stir into it either raspberries, cur- 
rants, or any other fruit. Fry in hot lard, the same as pancakes. 

191. Apple Fritters.— Make "batter as above, only thicker; pare 
apples; cut them in quarters, and core them; then take up a quar- 
ter of apple, with some batter, and fry then on both sides, in hot 
fat, the same as pancakes. 

192. Hasty Pudding.— Boil a quart of milk with four bay-leaves; 
beat up the yolks of two eggs and a little salt; stir in the milk; 
then take out the bay leaves, and with a wooden spoon in one 
hand with the other sprinkle in flour, and keep stirring it till it is 
of a good thickness. Let it boil, and keep it stirring ; then pour 
it into the dish, and stick pieces of butter here and there. 



PASTRY, CONFECTIONERY, BREAD, &c. 

193. Bread.— Put a peck of good flour into a pan or trough, and 
mix with it three pints of warm water and half a pint of good 
yeast ; stir it well with the hands till it becomes tough ; leave it to 
rise; then add another two quarts of warm water and a quarter 
of a pound of salt ; knead it well, and cover a cloth over it ; then 
begin to heat the oven ; by the time it is hot enough the dough 
will be ready to put in. Make up the dough into loaves of three 
pounds each; clean out the oven, and set in the bread; close the 
oven-door, and keep it shut till the bread is done, which will be in 
about two hours. Some persons mix boiled potatoes mashed with 
the flour ; they make the bread lighter. 

194. French Bread and French Bolls. — Mix the yolks of twelve 
eggs and the whites of eight, beaten and strained, a peck of fine 
flour, and a quart of good yeast (but not bitter), with as much 
warm milk as will make the whole into a thin, light dough ; stir it 
well, but do not knead it. Put the dough into dishes, and set it 
to rise; then turn it into a quick oven; when done rasp the 
loaves. 

French rolls are made by rubbing into every pound of flour an 
ounce of butter, one egg beaten, a little yeast, and sufficient milk 
to make a dough moderately stiff; beat it up, but do not knead 
it. Let it rise, and bake in rolls on tins; when baked, rasp 
them. 

195. Fine Rolls. — Warm a bit of butter in half a pint of milk; 
add to it two spoonfuls of small-beer yeast and some salt; with 
these ingredients mix two pounds of flour; let it rise an hour, and 
knead it well ; form the rolls, and bake them in a quick oven for 
twenty minutes. 

196. Tea Cakes.— These are prepared the same as bread, substi- 
tuting for the water warm milk, with a little butter melted in it,. 
and sugar ; let it rise ; knead it into thin cakes, which bake on an 
iron plate over the fire. 

197. Yorkshire Cakes. — Beat three pounds of flour, a pint and a 
half of warm milk, four spoonfuls of yeast, and four eggs, well 
together ; then let them rise in the tins before you bake. Put them 
in a slow oven. 

198. To Make a Plum Cake.— Take half a quartern of dough, 



44 
domestic: COOKERY. 



put it into a pan, and mix well into it half a pound of butter, half 
a pound of sugar, one pound of currants, a little mixed spice, a 
few carraway-seeds, some candied orange and lemon peel shred 
fine, a few bitter almonds blanched and crushed, and two eggs; 
knead these ingredients well together; butter your tin; pour in 
the cake and bake it. 

199. Pound Cake.— Take of flour, butter, and powdered sugar, 
of each one pound, eight yolks and four whites of eggs, and a few 
carraway seeds ; first beat up the butter to a cream — keep beating it 
one way — then gradually beat in the eggs, sugar, and flour. Bake 
it in a warm oven for an hour and a quarter. Cover the sides and 
bottom of the tin with buttered paper. 

200. Seed Cake.. — To half a quartern of dough put about six 
ounces of good dripping, the same quautity of sugar, a few car- 
ra way-seeds, and one egg. Mix all together, put it in a tin, or deep 
dish, and bake it. 

301. Ginger Nuts. — Six pounds of flour, a pound and a quarter 
of butter rubbed into a pound and throe-quarters of sugar; a quart 
of treacle, four ounces of ginger, a nutmeg, and a little cinnamon. 
Make the dough stiff, and then knead it hard for some time. Cut 
them into cakes, and bake. They will keep good a long while in a 
closely -covered stone jar. 

202. Gingerbread. — Use three pounds of treacle, four beaten 
eggs, a pound of brown sugar, two ounces of finely powdered 
ginger ; and of cloves, mace, and nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce 
each; of fine coriander and carraway -seeds, one ounce each; and 
four pounds of butter melted. Mix the whole together, and 
add as much flour as will knead it into a very stiff paste; roll it 
out, cut it into what form you choose, and bake it in a moderate 
oven. 

203. Arrotvroot Blancmange. — Take a quart of sweet milk, put 
about three parts of it into a saucepan, sweeten it with white 
sugar, and set it on the fire. Mix three tablespoonf ids of arrowroot 
with the rest of the milk, using a little at a time, so as to have it 
completely smooth and well-mixed. When the milk in the sauce- 
pan boils pour in the arrowroot, stirring it quickly, to prevent it 
being lumpy; it will thicken immediately. Let it boil for two or 
three minutes. Wet a mould with cold milk, and pour in the 
arrowroot, after stirring in two or three drops of oil of lemons. 
Let it stand till cold, then turn it out on a glass or china dish. 

204. Gooseberry Fool. — Pick a quart of full-grown unripe goose- 
berries, and put them into a saucepan with a little water. Cover 
them up and let them simmer veiy softly. When they are tender, 
but not so much done as to burst, take them off, strain the water 
from them, and turn them into a dish. Now bruise them to a fine 
pulp, and sweeten them with sugar to your taste. Let them stand 
till cool, and then add new milk or cream. 

205. Goosebewy Jam. — To every pound of red rough goose- 
berries add a pound of sugar; bruise the gooseberries in a mortar, 
and boil them well. When cold put the jam in pots. 

206. Blackben-y Jam. — Allow three-quarters of a pound of 
brown sugar to a pound of fruit. Boil the fruit half an hour; 
then add the sugar, and boil all together for ten minutes. 



45 

DOMESTIC COOKERY 



207. Raspberry Jam. — Allow a pound of sugar to each pound of 
fruit : press them with a spoon in an earthen dish, add the sugar, 
and boil all together for fifteen minutes. 

208. Strawberry Jam is made in the same way. 

309. CcUfs-Foot Jelly.— Boil two calf's-feet in half a gallon of 
water till it is reduced to a quart; strain it, let it stand till cold, 
skim off the fat, and take the jelly up clean; whatever sediment 
remains at the bottom, leave it. Put the jelly into a saucepan 
with a pint of mountain wine, half a pound of loaf sugar, and the 
juice of four lemons; then beat up six whites of eggs with a whisk, 
put them into a saucepan, and stir all together till it boils. When 
it has boiled a few minutes have ready a large flannel-bag and 
pour it in. It will run through quickly, therefore pour it in re- 
peatedly till it runs clear; then have ready a large basin, with the 
lemon-peels cut into it as thin as possible ; let the jelly run into it, 
and the peels will impart to it both a rich amber color and a fine 
flavor. Fill the glasses with a clean silver spoon. 

210. Red Currant Jelly.— Pick the currants from the stalks and 
put them into stone jars; set them in a cool oven till they are soft; 
then strain them off, and to every pint of juice add one pound of 
loaf sugar pounded. Boil the syrup about twenty minutes, skim- 
ming it all the time; pour it into the pots boiling hot, as it will set 
the sooner. Lay brandied paper on the top. 

211. Black Currant Jelly may be made in the same way ; only 
common brown sugar may be used. 

212. Apple Jelly. — Take two dozen of large golden pippins or 
golden russets, pare them, and put in as much water as will cover 
them; let them boil as fast as possible till the apples are reduced 
to a pulp; strain them through a jelly-bag, and to every pint of 
jelly put one pound of fine sugar ; boil it over a quick fire for a 
quarter of an hour, add lemon- juice to your taste, keep it boiling, 
and skim it. Try a little on a plate ; when it jellies, or sets, it is 
boiled enough. 

213. Rhubarb Jam. — Peel the stalks, and cut them up about an 
inch long; put them into a broad tin or copper pan with sufficient 
water to let them float. Let it boil till reduced to a pulp, keeping 
it well stirred from the bottom. Pass the pulp through a co- 
lander or coarse sieve, and to each pint add from three-quarters of 
a pound to a pound of sugar, either loaf or moist; put it back into 
the pan and boil it for another half hour, still keeping it stirred. 
Try now, by dropping a little on a plate, if it is done enough ; it 
should be of the consistence of jelly ; if it spread, boil it a little 
longer, till stiff beneath the finger. Pour it into pots or jars, and 
when cold, cover and tie it down like other preserves. 

214. Orange Marmalade. — Cut and squeeze Seville oranges ac- 
cording to the quantity you desire to make ; then take out the 
pulp, leaving the rind very thin, which shred quite fine, and boil 
till tender. Then boil the pulp quite soft and rub it through a 
hair-sieve; now mix the juice, pulp, and chips together, and to 
every pound add one pint of clarified sugar. Boil the sugar till it 
snaps, then add the other ingredients. Let them boil ten minutes 
and put them into pots.

HOME-MADE WINES AND COOLING BEVERAGES. 

215. Gooseberry. — Gather when half ripe, in dry weather. Pick- 
clean, put a peck into a vessel ; bruise wi*h a piece of wood, being 
careful to keep the seeds whole. Put the pulp into a canvas bag, 
press out the juice; to 1 gallon of which add about 2 pounds of 
fine loaf sugar; mix the whole by stirring with a stick, and when 
the sugar is dissolved, pour into a cask which will exactly contain 
it. If the quantity be 9 gallons, stand for a fortnight; if 20, 40 
days; and so in proportion, taking care to keep it cool. After 
standing the proper time, draw off from the lees, and put into 
another clean vessel of equal size, or the same, after pouring* 
away the lees, and making it clean. Let a cask of ten or twelve 
gallons stand about three months, and 20 gallons 5 months, after 
which bottle it off. 

216. Elder. — Pick berries when ripe, put into a stone jar, set 
them in a kettle of boiling water or an oven till the jar is hot 
through, then take them out, strain through a coarse sieve ; squeeze 
the berries, and put the juice into a clean vessel. To 1 quart of 
juice put one pound of sugar; boil, and skim clean. When clear, 
pour into a cask. Close up, let it stand 6 months, then bottle, 
fining it by adding to every 10 gallons 1 oz. of isinglass dissolved 
in cider, a quart of brandy and 6 eggs. 

217. Ginger. — To 7 gallons of water put 19 pounds of sugar, boil 
for half an hour, removing scum as it rises; then take a small 

Quantity of the liquor, add it to 9 ozs. of the best ginger bruised, 
'ut all together, when nearly cold, chop 9 pounds of raisins very 
small, and put them into a 9 gallon cask. Slice 4 lemons into the 
cask after taking seeds, pour the liquor over them, with half a 
pint of fresh yeast. Leave it unstopped for 3 weeks, keeping it 
filled up, and in 6 or 9 months will be fit for bottling. 

218. Red Currant. — Gather currants in dry weather; put into a 
pan and bruise with a wooden pestle ; let them stand about 20 hours, 
after which strain through a sieve ; add 3 pounds of finely pow- 
dered sugar to every gallon of the liquor, and, after shaking well, 
fill the vessel. If it does not prove clear in 2 or 3 months, draw 
off into another vessel, and let it stand a few days previous to bot- 
tling. 

219. Raspberry. — Gather them ripe; husk and bruise; strain 
through a bag into jars or other vessels. To 1 gallon of juice al- 
low 1 1-2 lb. of loaf sugar. When dissolved, decant liquor into a 
cask. When fermented, add 1 pint of white wine, or 1-2 a pint of 
proof spirits to every gallon contained in the cask, and hang a 
bag in it containing 1 oz. of bruised mace. In three months, if 
kept cool, will be fit for use. 

220. Mulberry. — Gather on a dry day, when just changed from 
redness to a shining black; spread thinly on a. fine cloth, or a 
clean floor or table, 24 hours, then press them. Boil 1 gallon of 
water for 1 gallon of juice, putting 1 oz. of cinnamon-bark, and 
6 ozs. of sugar-candy finely powdered, to each gallon of water. 
When the water is taken off and settled, skim and strain, and put 
it to the mulberry- juice. Add to 1 gallon of the mixture a pint of 
white or Rhenish wine. Let stand in a cask to ferment for 5 or 6 
days. When settled, draw off into bottles. Keep cool.

DOMESTIC COOKERY 



221. Damson. — Take a good quantity of damsons and common 
plums, which should be tolerably ripe, slit in halves, so that the 
stones will come out, then wash gently, and add a little water and 
honey. To every gallon of the pulp, put a gallon of spring water, 
with a few cloves and bay -leaves; boil the mixture, and add as 
much sugar as will well sweeten it; skim off froth, and let it cool. 
Now press the fruit, squeezing out the liquor; strain through a 
fine strainer, and put the water and juice together into a cask. 
Let it stand and ferment for 3 or 4 days: fine with whites of eggs; 
draw off into bottles and cork well. In 12 days it will be ripe. 

222. Raisin. — Wash well, pick them from the stalks: to 1 pound 
thus prepared and chopped, add 1 quart of water which has been 
boiled and become cold; add to every 10 gallons 6 pounds of fine 
sugar. Let the whole stand for a month, stirring it frequently. 
Then take the raisins from the cask, and stop the liquor closely in 
the vessel. In the course of a month, let it be racked into another 
vessel, leaving all the sediment behind. This must be repeated till 
it becomes fine; then add 1 dozen Seville oranges, the rinds being 
pared very thin, and infused in 2 quarts of brandy, which add to 
the liquor at its last racking. Let it stand in the cask 3 months, 
when it will be fit for bottling. Should remain in bottle 12 months. 

223. Grape. —Put 1 gallon of soft water to 1 gallon of ripe grapes, 
bruise and let stand a week, stirring occasionally; then draw 
the liquor off fine. To one gallon of wine put two pounds of loaf 
sugar; put into a vessel, buu do not stop it till it has done hissing; 
then stop close, and in 6 months will be fit to bottle. 

224. Orange. — Take 200 oranges, peel very thin, put peels into 
18 gallons of water, let them boil for 10 or 12 hours, till color and 
taste are all extracted. Squeeze into it the juice of the oranges 
through a sieve, add 1-2 cwt. of sugar, and stir till all is dissolved. 
Let it stand for 3 or 4 days, then barrel it, and put in 6 pounds of 
raisins and a gallon of brandy. Work it with a little yeast on 
toast, keep the cask filled, and when done working, bung up for 
12 months ; then bottle off, and it will keep for twenty years. 

225. Effervescing Draught. — Beat in a mortar 1 oz. tartaric acid ; 
divide into 24 parts, put each part into a blue paper; pound 1 oz. 
of bi-carbonic of soda, dividing into 24 parts, putting each part 
into white paper. These are then ready for use. When a draught 
is required, put the soda into a tumbler 1-2 filled with water; 
when dissolved, add acid. Drink while effervescing. 

226. Effervescing Fruit Drinks.— Put strawberries, raspberries, 
or blackberries into good vinegar, then strain it off, adding fresh 
fruit till the flavor is sufficiently strong. Bottle, and when about 
to use, dissolve a very small teaspoonful of soda in a little water; 
when the lumps are melted, fill up the tumbler two-thirds, add the 
fruit-vinegar. Should be drank immediately after it is mixed. 

227. Ginger Beer. — Put into 6 quarts of water 1 large spoonful of 
ginger, 1 also of cream of tarter, 1 pint of treacle, and 1-4 of a 
pint of home-brewed yeast. When it begins to ferment, bottle it. 

228. Lemonade. — Shave the rind of 2 lemons very thin into a 
jug, remove the pith, and cut the fruit in thin slices on the peel; 
add 1-4 lb. of loaf sugar, and pour over all a quart of boiling 
water. An agreeable beverage either hot or cold.

HOW TO PICKLE. 



The strongest and best vinegar should be vised for pickling. It 
must not be boiled, or the strength of the vinegar and spices will be 
evaporated. By parboiling the pickles in brine, they will be ready 
in much less time than they are when done in the usual 
manner of soaking them in cold salt and water for six or eight 
days. When taken out of the hot brine, let them get cold and 
quite dry before you put them into the pickle. 

To assist the preservation of pickles a portion of salt is added, 
and for the same purpose, and to give flavor, long pepper, black 
pepper, allspice, ginger, cloves, mace, garlic, eschalots, mustard, 
horseradish,* and capsicum. 

The following is the best method of preparing the pickle; it is 
as cheap as any, requires less care than any other way: — Bruise in 
a mortar four ounces of the above spices, put them into a stone 
jar with a quart of the strongest vinegar, stop the jar closely with 
a bung, cover that with a bladder soaked with pickle, and set it on a 
trivet by the side of the fire for three days, well shaking it up 
three or four times in the day. The jar being well closed, and the 
infusion being made with a mild heat, there is no loss by evapora- 
tion. 

To enable the articles pickled more easily and speedily to im- 
bibe the flavor of the pickle they are immersed in, previously to 
pouring it on them, run a larding pin through them in several 
places, or prick them with a fork. 

Pickles should be kept in a dry place, in unglazed earthenware, 
or glass jars, which ai*e preferable, as you can, without opening* 
them, observe whether they want filling up ; they must be very 
carefully stopped with well-fitted bungs, and tied over as closely 
as possible with a bladder wetted with the pickle. 

When the pickles are all used, boil up the liquor with a little 
fresh spice. 

To walnut liquor may be added a few anchovies and eschalots; 
let it stand till it is quite clear, and bottle it ; thus you may fur- 
nish your table with an excellent savory keeping sauce for hashes, 
made dishes, fish, &c, at very small cost. 

Jars should not be more than three parts filled with the articles 
pickled, which should be covered with pickle at least two inches 
above their surface; the liquor wastes, and all of the articles 
pickled that are not covered are soon spoiled. 

When they have been done about a week open the jars and fill 
them up with pickle. If you discern in them any symptoms of 
not keeping well do them over again in fresh vinegar and spice. 

Tie a wooden spoon, full of holes, *or a wooden fork, round each 



60 

HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



jar, to take them out with; and if you take out more pickles than 
you require to use, do not put what is left back into the jar. 

If you wish to have your pickles of a nice, but perfectly harm- 
less green, nothing succeeds better than boiling the vegetables 
in water made slightly alkaline, sometimes either with a small 
quantity of bicarbonate of of soda, sometimes with lime-water, 
and sometimes with saccharate of lime, or with water containing 
a quarter of an ounce of liquid ammonia to the quart. 

If you wish cauliflowers, onions, etc. , to be white, use distilled 
vinegar for them. 

Last of all, do not use brass or copper kettles for pickling; as 
the verdigris produced in them by the vinegar is of a most pois- 
onous nature when the vinegar is allowed to cool in them. Glazed 
kettles are the best, but if you cannot procure them, block tin 
may be substituted. Iron is apt to discolor any acid that is boiled 
in it. 

RED CABBAGE. 

Red cabbage should be pickled in September. Having taken off 
the large outside leaves, cut the cabbage into quarters, taking out 
the stalk. Then shred the whole into a colander, and sprinkle 
with salt, in which let them remain for about twenty-four hours, 
when they must be drained and put into a jar, and have the fol- 
lowing pickle poured over them cold: To each quart of vinegar 
put an ounce of ground black pepper, half an ounce of pounded 
ginger, some salt, and horseradish cut in slices, and a few capsi- 
cums or cayenne, according to taste. Put all these into a jar stop- 
ped close, and let them steep three days on a trivet by the side of 
the fire, and when cold strain the liquor through a cloth, and pour 
it on the cabbage. 

ONIONS. 

Choose small button onions, as near of a size as possible ; throw 
them into warm water, which will prevent their affecting the 
eyes so much while peeling them. As they are peeled, throw 
them into a strong brine of salt and water ; let them remain in 
this till the next day ; then put them on the fire, and boil them in 
it for a minute. Or, as they are peeled, throw them into milk 
and water. Drain them from this when they are all done ; put 
them into a jar, and pour the brine on them boiling hot. Cover 
them close, and set them aside till the next day. Drain, and dry 
them in a cloth ; put them into cold distilled vinegar, with a few 
blades of bruised ginger, some whole pepper, and, if approved, 
a little mace and sliced horseradish. Keep them always well 
covered with vinegar. Cork the jar close, and put it in a cool, 
dry place. 

FRENCH BEANS OR GHERKINS. 

Put the beans or gherkins into a brine of salt and water made 
strong enough to float an egg ; let them remain in this for four or 
five days, or a week ; take them from the brine, and put them 
into a saucepan with equal quantities of vinegar and water suffi- 
cient for them to float in ; heat them in this until it is scalding hot 
or almost boiling, but it must not boil. Keep them at this heat 



61 



HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



for an hour or two, and put them into a jar or pan to cool, in the 
liquor they were scalded in. if they are not sufficiently green, 
heat them again, and let them cool as before. That is the proper 
way to preserve the green color. When cold, drain the vinegar 
and water from them, and put them into cold vinegar with bruis- 
ed ginger, whole allspice, mace, and pepper. Cork the jars close, 
tie them over with leather or pieces of bladder, and keep them in 
a cool, dry place. 

Gherkins for pickling should be about the size of a finger, 
smaller than this they have not attained their flavor; French 
beans, quite young, or before they are half grown. 

CUCUMBERS. 

Cucumbers may be preserved in the same manner as the French 
beans and gherkins, or the skin may be thinly pared off, and each 
cut in two, the seeds taken out, and preserved ilike the preceding, 
or as follows:— Cut a piece from the end of each, leaving it hang- 
ing to a bit of the skin, scoop out the seeds, and put them into a 
strong brine. Take them out at the expiration of a week; fill the 
insides with equal parts of mustard-seed, ground ginger, and pep- 
per, mixed with some small onions peeled, or a few heads of garlic 
and some whole allspice. Sew or tie on the top again, green, and 
finish them as gherkins. 

Melons and mangoes are prepared in the same way. 

Cucumbers for pickling should be full grown, but not over- 
grown; melons, half grown. 

CAULIFLOWERS OR BROCOLI. 

The whitest and firmest cauliflowers that can be obtained should 
be chosen for this purpose. Cut or break the flowers into small 
branches, and put them into salt and water for a week or ten 
days. The brine, or pickle, should be made strong enough with salt 
for an egg to float on the surface. Take them from the brine, and 
put them into a saucepan of clean water. Let them boil for about 
ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or until they begin to get 
tender; but they must not be done, or they will lose their crisp- 
ness. Drain them from the water, and spread them on a coarse 
cloth, or on sieves, and put them to dry in the sun until all the 
moisture is evaporated; then put them into a jar, and cover them 
with distilled or white wine vinegar. Mace, long pepper, white 
peppercorns, and a few grains of allspice, may be added to the 
vinegar, which should be kept warm for some time by the side of 
the fire to extract the flavor of the spice, but must not be allowed 
to boil. Pour the vinegar over the cauliflower when it is cold. 
Cork the jar close, and put it aside for use. Fill the jar occasion- 
ally with vinegar, as the flowers absorb it. 

WALNUTS. 

Take large, full-grown walnuts, but they must be tender, so 
that they can be easily pierced with a needle. Lay them in salt 
and water for two days, then shift them into another weak brine; 
in a couple of days put them into fresh water for two days longer, 
after which take them out and lay them on a board, so that they 
may not touch each other; let them stay in the sun for a day or 



d2 



HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



two till they are perfectly dry, and turn black. Then put them 
into a clean, dry stone jar, and for every hundred walnuts allow 
half a pint of mustard-seed, half an ounce of black pepper, half 
an ounce of allspice, a quarter of an ounce of mace, six bay- 
leaves, and a stick of horseradish sliced; mix these ingredients 
with the walnuts, which should fill the jar, and fill up with boil- 
ing vinegar. Put a plate on the top, and, when cold, tie them 
down closely with bladder and leather. They will be ready for 
use in two or three months; meanwhile they' must bo examined 
occasionally, and kept covered with vinegar. Some persons put 
in an onion stuck with cloves, and some sliced ginger. 

Another Way. — Take a hundred walnuts, wipe them, prick them 
with a larga needle, and put them into a jar, sprinkling, as you 
lay them in, the following spices mixed: Cloves, allspice, nut- 
meg, whole pepper, and sliced ginger, of each an ounce; half a 
pint of mustard-seed, four cloves of garlic, and a stick of horse- 
radish; then add two tablespoon fuls of salt, and sufficient boiling 
vinegar to cover the whole. Cover the jar as above, and when 
cold tie down closely. 

The liquor makes excellent catsup for flavoring steaks, chops, 
sauces, and stews. 

Another Way. — Put green walnut shells into a brine of salt and 
water strong enough to float an egg\ let them lie covered in this 
ten or twelve days; take them out, and lay them in the sun for a 
week ; put them Into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar on them ; in 
about a week or ten days pour off the vinegar, make it boiling 
hot, and pour o^er them again. In a month it will be fit for use, 
and will be found excellent to eat with cold meat, and particular- 
ly useful in making many sauces. 

♦ CELERY. 

Separate the stalks from the heads; cleanse them thoroughly, 
and put them into salt and water strong enough to bear an egg. 
Let them remain in this for a week or ten days, or until wanted 
to pickle; then take them out, wash them well in clean water, 
drain dry, place in a jar and pour boiling vinegar over, to which 
any approved spices may have been added, as is usual for pickling. 
Keep it well covered with vinegar. If the celery be allowed to 
remain a long time in salt and water, it will be necessary to soak 
it in clean water for a day or two, changing the water occasion- 
ally. 

BEETROOT. 

Beetroots should be pickled in September. To pickle beetroots, 
boil them till three-parts done: then, when cold, peel them and 
cut them into thin slices ; put the cut slices into a jar, and pour on 
them hot spiced vinegar, sufficient to cover the whole. After 
they have stood a month they will be fit for use, and will be found 
an excellent and wholesome pickle. 

NASTURTIUMS. 
There are two varieties of nasturtium — the major and minor; 
both yield seeds fit for pickling, which are an excellent substitute 
for capers. The young shoots are equally as good as the seeds for 



53 

HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



pickling, and their flavor improves an ordinary salad when not 
used in excess. The method of pickling nasturtium is as follows: 
Fill any jar with the nasturtium seeds or shoots, then pour on 
them boiling vinegar, to which add a good seasoning of salt. Boil 
up the vinegar every three days till the pickle is of a good color; 
then add a little ginger and whole pepper. Another way is to 
cover the seeds or shoots with strong brine, set the jar on the 
trivet, and keep them hot for three days ; then pour off the brine, 
and pour on scalding vinegar, and keep them hot for a week or 
ten days till they are of good color; then add spice, such as ginger 
and pepper: or, better still, pour off the last vinegar, and add in 
its place spiced vinegar. The nasturtiums should be full grown, 
but not old; they are ready for pickling in September. 

RED CAPSICUMS. 

Red capsicums are pickled by simply putting them into cold 
vinegar, with a little whole allspice and mace. Lay green capsi- 
oums for three days in strong brine ; drain them from this, and 
put them into cold distilled vinegar, with a little mace and whole 
allspice. Nasturtium-buds may also be done as these. 

TOMATOES. 

Peel them without putting them into water as before di- 
rected, slice them into a jar, add pepper and salt, and cover 
them with a good vinegar. Excellent with cold meat, or as a 
salad with a little oil. 

Another Way. — Take any quantity of green tomatoes, and peel 
them. To two quarts of tomatoes add three or four small green 
capsicums, one pint of small onions, scalded in salt and water and 
peeled, half a pound of salt, and one pint of mustard-seed. Chop 
the whole fine, so as to make a mince. Strew over the bottom of 
a jar about two inches thick with the mince, then salt and mustard- 
seed, and again mince, until the whole is disposed of; set it away 
for a few days for the salt to dissolve, and cover with the best 
vinegar. 

RADISH-PODS. 

Boil some vinegar with salt and spice, and when cold put in the 
radish-pods; or they may be put into old vinegar, from which 
green pickles or onions have been taken — only boil it up afresh. 
Radish-pods make an excellent pickle, and", like nasturtiums, 
serve as a good substitute for capers. 

CHEAP AND WHOLESOME PICKLES. 

Take a jar with a close lid or bung, and half fill it with the best 
vinegar ; then, as spare vegetables of any description come to hand, 
such as small beans, cauliflowers, radish-pods, young cucumbers, 
onions, &c, throw them in, taking care, as the jar fills, that there 
is sufficient vinegar to. cover the vegetables. When nearly full, 
add mustard-seeds, bruised ginger, eschalots, whole pepper, &c, 
to taste. Tie down tightly and place the jar in a vessel of water 
over the fire, or in a slow oven until the articles are sufficiently 
soft to suit the palate. In this manner good, wholesome pickles 
can be made at only the expense of the vinegar and spice, and 
with the least possible amount of trouble. Of course, if thy 



45 

HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



various kinds of vegetables are wished to be kept distinct, such 
may be done. 

AMERICAN PICKLE. 

To eight quarts of cold spring water add seven pounds of salt, 
ten ounces of saltpetre, and one pound of treacle; mix well to- 
gether, and let it stand till the next day; it will then be ready to 
receive pork, beef, or tongues. This pickle possesses many ad- 
vantages; the principal one is, that meat preserved in it never gets 
hard, or too salt ; it will keep good from three to five months, ac- 
cording to the quantity of provisions cured in it. 

w PICCALILLI. 

This is a mixture of all kinds of pickles. Select from the salt 
brine, of a uniform size and of various colors, small cucumbers, 
button onions, small bunches of cauliflowers, carrots cut in fanci- 
ful shape, turnips sliced, radishes, radish-pots, French beans, cay- 
enne-pods, mace, ginger, long spice, strips of horseradish, &c. Ar- 
range your selection tastefully in glass jars, and pour over them a 
liquor prepared in the following manner: — To one gallon of whits 
wine vinegar add eight tablespoon fuls of salt, eight of mustard- 
flour, four of ground ginger, two of pepper, two of allspice, two 
of turmeric, and boil all together one minute; the mustard and 
turmeric must be mixed together with vinegar before they are 
put into the liquor ; when the liquor has boiled pour it into a pan, 
cover it closely, and when it is cold pour it into the jars contain- 
ing the pickles; cover the jars with cork, tie them down with blad 
der, and let them stand six months, when they will contain good 
pickles. Piccalilli is an excellent accompaniment to many highly 
seasoned dishes; if well put up, it will keep for years. If you like 
oil in the piccalilli, it should be well incorporated with the vine- 
gar, and added with the other ingredients to the boiling liquor. 

MIXED PICKLE AND INDIA PICKLE. 

Fill a large jar half full ot brine made strong enough to float an 
egg. Into this put, as convenient, various sort of vegetables that 
are usually pickled, such as small onions, radish-pods, scalded 
branches of cauliflowers, French beans, gherkins, and cucumbers 
sliced, also rock samphire, white cabbage sliced, celery, &c. These 
may lie in the salt and water until the whole is collected, without 
being injured, observing that the last article should be allowed to 
remain in the brine for ten or twelve days; then take them out 
and lay them on sieves, or spread out on cloths to drain and dry. 
When dry, pack them in a jar; cover them with cold vinegar, and 
let them remain for ten days or a fortnight (a month or two will 
make no difference), observing, if mixed pickle be required, to 
pour off the vinegar, boil it up, and pour over the pickles twice or 
three times ; but for India pickle, prepare a gallon of vinegar, 
more or less according to the quantity of pickles to be done, in the 
following manner: — Mix gradually a quarter of a pound of the 
best flour of mustard, and two ounces of powdered turmeric, with 
some of the cold vinegar at first, to ensure its being properly mix- 
ed ; then add the rest, with a quarter of a pound of white mustard- 
seed. Bruise a quarter of a pound of ginger, two ounces of white 



55 

HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



£ 



epper, and one ounce of chilies, and tie them in a muslin bag. 

►oil the whole gently for twenty minutes or half an hour, and 
pour it, whilst boiling, on the pickles, having previously drained 
off the vinegar they were first put in. In ten or twelve days re- 
peat the boiling, pour it over the pickles whilst boiling hot, and 
they will be ready for use when cold. 



HOW TO PRESERVE. 



GENERAL RULES AND DIRECTIONS. 

Let everything used for the purpose of preserving be perfectly 
clean and dry ; bottles especially so. 

Never place a preserving-pan flat upon the fire, as this wilt 
render the preserve liable to burn ; but let it rest on a trivet, or 
on the lowered bar of the kitchen range. 

After having added the sugar, stir the preserves gently, gradual- 
ly increasing the motion, not ceasing until they are done ; this 
precaution will always prevent the chance of their being 
spoiled. 

Clear the scum off the top of the jam with a spoon as it rises. 

Fruit which is to be preserved in syrup must first be blanched 
or boiled gently, until it becomes soft enough to absorb the sugar ; 
and a thin syrup must be poured on it at first, or it will shrivel 
instead of remaining plump and becoming clear. Thus, if its 
weight of sugar is to be allowed, and boiled to a syrup with a 
pint of water to the pound, only half the weight must be taken 
at first, and this must not be boiled with the water more than 
fifteen or twenty minutes at the commencement of the process ; a 
part of the remaining sugar must be added every time the syrup 
is reboiled, unless it should be otherwise directed in the receipt. 

To preserve both the true flavor and the color of fruit in jams 
and jellies, boil them rapidly until they are well reduced, before 
the sugar is added, and quickly afterwards; but do not allow them 
to become so much thickened that the sugar will not dissolve in 
them easily and throw up its scum. In some seasons the juice is 
so much richer than in others, that this effect takes place almost 
before one is aware of it ; but the drop which adheres to the skim- 
mer, when it is held up, will show the state it has reached. 

Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons or skimmers for pre- 
serves, as they will convert the color of red fruit into a dingy 
purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavor. 

When cheap jams or jellies are required, make them at once 
with loaf sugar, but use that which is well refined always, for 
preserves in general ; it is a false economy to purchase an in- 
ferior kind, as there is great waste from it in the quantity of 
-scum which it throws up. 

Pans of copper or bell-metal are the proper utensils for pre- 
serving fruit: when used, they must be scoured bright with sand. 
Tinned pans turn and destroy the color of the fruit that is put 
into them. Stew-pans are also made of iron, glazed inside, which 
is very nice for preserving. 



56 

HOW TO PICKLE AXD PRESERVE. 



In clarifying sugar take the finest kind, break it into large 
lumps, and put it into a preserving-pan. If for syrup, add a pint 
of cold water to each pound; jf for candying, a couple of wine- 
glassfuls to the pound will be sufficient. Beat the white of an 
egg, add it to the water, mix it well, and pour it over the sugar; 
one egg is enough for twelve pounds of sugar if it is fine, or two 
if it is coarse. When the sugar is nearly melted, stir it well, and 
put it over a gentle fire ; do not stir it after the scum begins to 
rise ; let it boil five minutes, then take it off the fire, let it stand a 
minute or two, then take the scum carefully off; put the pan 
again on the fire, and when the syrup begins to boil throw in a 
little cold water, which should be kept back for the purpose; boil 
till the scum rises, draw it off from the fire, and skim it as before ; 
repeat this till quite clear; it is then fit for use. It is by long 
boiling that the differ ent degrees are acquired, which the confec- 
tioner requires. 

A simple method of candying fruit is to lay some fruits from 
syrup into a clean sieve; to dip it quickly into hot water, and 
then put the fruit into a fine cloth to drain; sift over it refined 
sugar, and dry on sieves in a moderate oven. 

A little powdered alum dissolved in water, and put into the 
syrup of preserves, with a full quantity of sugar, will sometimes 
prevent their candying. 

The only secret of storing preserves is to exclude the air from 
them, and to set them in a drj' place, not placing the pots on each 
other. 

If preserves seem slightly damp, and unlikely to keep well, to 
save the waste of second boiling, remove the papers, and put the 
jars in a cool oven (after a batch of bread is drawn is as good a 
time as any), and let them remain until the preserves get thorough- 
ly heated. When cold, cover them as before. Writing-paper, 
saturated with good olive oil, is better than steeping it in brandy 
to cover the tops of the preserves. Tie pieces of bladder or paper 
over this. 

Fruit jellies may be preserved from mouldiness by covering the 
surface one-fourth of an inch deep with finely pulverized loaf 
sugar. Thus protected, they will keep in good condition for 
years. 

All fruits for preserving should be gathered in dry weather ; but, 
as this is not alwaj r s practicable, much inconvenience may be 
obviated by boiling the fruits for jellies and jams long before the 
sugar is added. By so doing, the watery particles will evaporate, 
and the preserve will be better flavored by the sugar not being too 
long on the fire. 

JAMS AND PRESERVES. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

Take equal weights of fruit and moist sugar: put them on the 
tire together; keep stirring and breaking the fruit till the sugar 
melts, then boil till it will jelly on a plate. 

Though simple, this will be found a very good receipt. 



57 

HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



Another Way. — Take equal weights of fruit and roughly- 
pounded loaf sugar; bruise the fruit with the back of a spoon, and 
boil them together for half an hour; if a little more juice is 
wanted, add the juice of currants drawn as for jelly. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. 

Allow equal weights of pounded loaf sugar and of strawberries ; 
mash them in the preserving-pan, and mix the sugar well with it ; 
stir, scum, and boil it for twenty minutes. 

BLACK CURRANT JAM. 

Allow equal weights of clipped currants and of pounded loaf 
sugar; bruise and mash the fruit in a preserving-pan over the 
fire; add the sugar; stir it frequently; when it boils, skim, and 
let it boil for ten minutes. 

WHITE OR RED CURRANT JAM. 

Pick the fruit very nicely, and allow an equal quantity of fine- 
ly-pounded loaf sugar; put a layer of each alternately into a pre- 
serving-pan, and boil for ten minutes; or they may be boiled the 
same length of time in sugar previously clarified and boiled candy 
high. 

GRAPE JAM. 

The grapes ought not to be very ripe. They should be carefully 
picked, and all that are at all injured should be rejected. To one 

Eound of grapes add a half pound of sugar ; no water but what 
angs about them after they have been washed. Put the grapes 
into a cooking-pan, then a layer of sugar, then a layer of grapes. 
Boil on a moderate fire, stirring it all the time, to prevent its 
burning. 

CHERRY JAM. 

Stone four pounds of cherries, and put them in a preserving-pan 
with two pounds of fine white sugar and a pint of red currant 
juice. Boil the whole together rather fast, until it stiffens, and 
then put it into pots for use. 

GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

Stalk and crop six pounds of the small, red, rough gooseberry, 

Eut them into a preserving-pan, and, as they warm, stir and 
ruise them to brmg out the juice. Let them boil for ten min- 
utes, then add four pounds of sugar, and place it on the fire 
again: let it boil, and continue boiling for two hours longer, stir- 
ring it all the time to prevent its burning. When it thickens, and 
will jelly upon a plate, it is clone enough. Put it into pots, and 
allow it to remain a day before it is covered. 

BLACKBERRY JAM. 

In families where there are many children there is no prepara- 
tion of fruit so wholesome, so cheap, and so much admired, as 
this homely conserve. The fruit should be clean picked in dry 
weather, and to every pound of berries put a half pound of coarse 
brewn sugar; boil the whole together for three-quarters of an 
hour or an hour, stirring it well the whole time. Put it in pots

like any other preserve, and it will be found most useful in fami- 
lies: it is medicinal for children. 

PINE-APPLE JAM. 

Pare*and weigh the pine-apples, and grate them down on a large 
grater. To one pound of fruit put three-quarters of a pound of 
powdered sugar ; put it over the fire, and Avhen it comes to a boil 
ttir till done. Boil it half an hour or more till clear; put it in 
jars, and cover it carefully. 

PINE-APPLES. 

Take off the top and bottom of the pine, and pare the outside ; 
put a pint of water, two pounds of loaf-sugar, one lemon (cut in 
slices), and the peeling of the pine, together, into a well-tinned 
saucepan ; then boil them for about five minutes. Now strain the 
syrup, then cut up the pine-apple into thin slices, and put them 
with the strained syrup into the saucepan. The pine is now to be 
boiled till it is easily pricked with a sharp wooden skewer. The 
preserve is then fit for keeping in jars "as long as one can." The 
number of pines to a pint of syrup depends, of course, on their 



Cut the rhubarb as for tarts, and to every quart give one pound 
of good moist sugar. Put the sugar over the rhubarb, and leave 
it twenty -four hours to draw out the juice. The sugar sinks, but 
is not dissolved. Boil the juice and sugar together for twenty 
minutes after it begins to boil just at the edge of the pan; then 
add the rhubarb, and boil slowly twenty minutes longer. There 
is no need to stir the syrup or preserve, if slowly boiled. The 
rhubarb and sugar do not require a warm place to draw out the 
juice. By this method the pieces of rhubarb remain separate from 
each other when the preserve is done. It keeps good a year, if 
kept in jars well dried, and in a dry place. 

Or, procure six oranges, peel them, and take away the white 
rind and the kernels ; then slice the pulp into the stewpan, along 
with the peel cut very small ; add thereto one quart of rhubarb 
cut fine, and from one pound to one pound and a half of loaf 
sugar. Boil the whole down in the usual way, as for other pre- 
serves. Made in this manner it will be found almost equal to 
Scotch marmalade. 

STRAWBERRIES OR RASPBERRIES, FOR CREAMS OR ICES, WITHOUT 
BOILING. 

Let the fruit be gathered in the middle of a warm day, in very 
dry weather ; strip it from the stalks directly, weigh it, turn it 
into a bowl or deep pan, and bruise it gently ; mix with an equal 
weight of fine, dry, sifted sugar, and put it immediately into 
small, wide-necked bottles; cork these firmly without delay, and 
tie a bladder over the tops. Keep them in a cool place, or the fruit 
will ferment. The mixture should be stirred softly, and only just 
sufficiently to blend the sugar and the fruit. The bottles must be 
perfectly dry, and the bladders, after having been cleaned in the 



59 

HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



usual way, and allowed to become nearly so, should be moistened 
with a little spirit on the side which is to be next to the cork. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

To two pounds of fine large strawberries add two pounds of 

gowdered sugar, and put them in a preserving-kettle, over a slow 
re, till the sugar is melted ; then boil them precisely twenty min- 
utes, as fast as possible; have ready a number of small jars, and 
put the fruit in boiling hot. Cork and seal the jars immediately, 
and keep them through the summer in a cold, dry cellar. The 
jars must be heated before the hot fruit is poured" in, otherwise 
they will break. 

RASPBERRIES, WHOLE. 

Take five quarts of raspberries, and cull from them about three 
pints of the largest and firmest, and set them aside ; put the re- 
mainder in the preserving pan, and put them on the fire to extract 
the juice. When they are boiled enough let them cool, and then 
strain them through a cloth. While thej T are cooling boil up the 
sugar in the proportion of one pound to one quart of the fruit; 
and A-hen you have removed the scum, and it is a good syrup, 
throw in your whole raspberries; let them boil rapidly a few min- 
utes, but be careful they do not fall to pieces or become ragged. 
Take them out with a skimmer f idl of holes, and spread them over 
a large dish to cool; then throw into the syrup the juice of those 
you have previously boiled, and let it boil till it is nearly a jelly; 
throw in again the whole fruit, and give it a smart boil; then put 
it in your jars hot, and do not cover them till cold. 

DAMSONS. 

To every pound of damsons allow three-quarters of a pound of 
powdered sugar; put into jars of well-gmzed earthen pots, alter- 
nately a layer of damsons and one of sugar; tie strong paper or 
cloth over the pots, and set them in the oven after the bread is 
drawn, and let them stand till the oven is cold. The next day 
strain off the syrup, and boil it till thick ; when it is cold, put the 
damsons into small jars or glasses, pour over the syrup, which 
should cover them, and tie a wet bladder or strong cloth over 
them. 

GREENGAGES IN SYRUP. 

Those should be chosen which are not quite ripe. Let them be 
sound, and as fresh-gathered as possible. Prick them several 
times to the stone with a fork or needle, and throw them into a 
pan of cold water as they are done. Put them into a preserving- 
pan, and let them heat gradually until the water is scalding hot; 
keep them at this heat for an hour or two; then take them off, 
and cover them with vine or cabbage leaves, and let them get 
cold in the vvater they were scalded in. Heat them again in 
the same water as before; when they are of a nice green, let 
them have one or two boils, take them out, and put them into 
cold water; drain them from this, and pour a thin syrup, 
made with a pound and a half of sugar to a pint of water, 
over them, boiling hot. Have sufficient to cover them, and 
let them remain iix it for two or three days. Drain off the 



60 

HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



syrup into a preserving-pan; add half a pound more sugar to 
each pint of water that was used ; boil, scum, and pour it boiling 
hot over the fruit. After three or four days, or a week, pour off 
the syrup, and boil it again, adding a little more sugar to make it 
of a consistence to draw into rather a strong thread between the 
finger and thumb, which will be when nearly three pounds of 
sugar have been used to the pint. Pour this over them boiling 
hot; cover them over when cold, and put them away for use. 
Keep in a cool, dry place. They may be greened by allowing 
them to remain covered with leaves in the water they were first 
scalded in for three or four days, or until it is quite sour; then 
taken out, drained dry, f-nd heated in the first syrup. 

Magnum bonum, mussel, and other plums, when green, should 
be preserved as these. 

GOOSEBERRIES. 

Take the rough-skinned fruit when quite dry, with rather more 
than their weight of sugar pounded fine; lay a layer of fruit and 
a layer of sugar, till all are in the pan ; add a teaspoonf ul of 
water, and boil the fruit quickly until it is clear ; take it out, and 
put it into jars; boil up the syrup until it is thick, then pour it 
over the fruit. When cold, cover it closely. 

PEACHES, WHOLE (AN ECONOMICAL WAY). 

To fifteen pounds of cling-stone peaches take seven and a half 
pounds of loaf sugar; put two or three quarts of water in the ket- 
tle with one teaspoonful of pear lash, to destroy the skins of the 
fruit. When the water is hot, throw in a few peaches, and let 
them remain a few minutes ; take them out, and wipe off the skins 
with a coarse towel, and thet? throw them into cold water. Take 
half the sugar, with as little water as possible to dissolve it; then 
put in a layer of peaches, and let them boil from twenty to thirty 
minutes. Take them out on a flat dish to cool. After two or three 
layers have been boiled in this way the syrup will increase ; by 
degrees add the rest of the sugar. When all are done, boil the 
syrup until it becomes a little thick; then add, while in the kettle, 
half a pint of alcohol, which will cool and thicken it sufficiently 
to put on the peaches, which should be ready in your jars; do not 
cover them until the next day. They will not have the least taste 
of the alcohol, and are a very fine preserve. 

PEACHES. 

The clear-stone yellow peaches, white at the stone, are the best. 
Weigh the fruit after it is pared. To each pound of fruit allow a 
pound of loaf sugar. Put a layer of sugar at the bottom of the 
preserving-kettle, and then a layer of fruit; and so on, un- 
til the fruit is all in; stand it over hot ashes until the sugar 
is entirely dissolved; then boil them until they are clear; 
take them out piece by piece, and spread them on a dish free from 
syrup. Boil the syrup in the pan until it jellies. When the 
peaches are cold fill the jars half full with them, and fill up with 
the boiling syrup. Let them stand a short time covered with a 
thin cloth ; then put on brandy-paper, and cover them close with 



HOW TO FICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



corks, skin, or paper. From twenty to thirty minutes will gen- 
erally be sufficient to preserve them. 

BRANDY PEACHES. 

To six pounds of the fruit, peeled, put three pounds of loaf 
sugar and three pints of white French brandy. Put them in a jar 
tightly corked, and boil till soft in a kettle of hot water. The 
water should reach to the top, but not over the top of the jar. 
QUINCES. 

Peel the quinces, and clear the cores out well, saving all the 
seeds. Wash the peelings well, and put them on to boil ; let them 
boil until the water partakes strongly of the flavor of the quinces; 
put the seeds in a linen bag, and boil them with the parings. Put 
the quinces in a separate pan, and let them boil until almost ten- 
der. Strain all the quince water; put one pint of the water to 
each pound of fruit and sugar; boil the quinces until they are 
quite clear; then put them on dishes cleared from the syrup.' Boil 
the syrup till it jellies with the bag of seeds, from which the sub- 
stance should be pressed in the jelly. 

It is well to add two or three pints of quince water, and two or 
three pounds of sugar more than is required for the fruit, for 
floating islands, etc. 

GREEN GINGER. 

For two weeks put the ginger every night and morning in fresh 
boiling water. Take off the outside skin with a sharp knife; boil 
it in water till it is quite tender, and slice it thin; prepares syrup 
of one pound of sugar to half a pint of water, clarify it, and then, 
put the ginger into it. Boil it until it is clear. 

APPLES, WHOLE. 

Make a syrup of loaf sugar, allowing a pound of pleasant sour 
apples to a pound of sugar. Be very particular in skimming it 
until it is quite clear. The apjjles should be pared very nicely, 
and their cores extracted, with an instrument made for the pur- 
pose, before they are weighed. Boil the apples in as much water 
as will cover them until they become soft; but take care that 
they do not commence to break. Those that cook first should be 
removed on a strainer until they are all tender. Squeeze the juice 
of one large lemon for every pound of loaf sugar. Pare off the 
lemon-peel, if possible, without breaking it; boil the juice and the 
peel in the same water that has boiled the apples; pour in the 
syrup as soon as the lemon-peel is tender, and boil it ten minutes, 
or till it is a strong syrup. The apples which have been cooling 
on a dish should then be gently put in jars, and the hot syrup 
poured on them. Tie up the jars, and do not open them for a 
fortnight. 

CRAB APPLES. 

IVfa'ce a syrup, allowing the same weight of sugar as apples. 
Let it cool, then put in the apples, a few at once, so that they will 
not crowd and break to pieces. Boil them till they begin to break; 
then take them out of the kettle. Boil the syrup in the course of 
ikree or four days, and turn it while hot on "to the apples. This 



JIOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 

continue to do at intervals of two or three days, till the apples 
appear to be thoroughly preserved. 

PEARS. 

Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin syrup; let them lie 
a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and simmer again, and re- 
peat this till they are clear; then drain, and dry them in the sun 
or a cool oven a very little time. They may be kept in syrup, and 
dried as wanted, which makes them more moist and rich. 

PUMPKINS. 

Choose a thick yellow pumpkin which is sweet; pare, take out 
the seeds, and cut the thick part into any form you choose — round, 
square, egg-shaped, stars, wheels, &c. ; weigh it; put it into a 
stone jar or deep dish, and pk,ce it in a pot of water to boil, till 
the pumpkin is so soft that you can pass a fork through it. The 
pot may be kept uncovered; and be sure that no water boils into 
the jar. Take the weight of the pumpkin in good loaf sugar, 
clarify it, and boil the syrup witli the juice of one lemon to every 
pound of sugar, and the peel cut in little squares. When the 
pumpkin is soft, put it into the syrup, and let it simmer gently 
about an hour, or till the liquor is thick and rich; then let it 
cool, and put it in glass jars, well secured from the air. It makes 
a very rich sweetmeat. 

LEMON. 

An excellent substitute for jam may be made as follows: — 
One pound of powdered loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, six eggs, leaving out the whites of two of them; 
the juice and rind of three fine lemons. Put the ingredients 
into a saucepan, and stir the whole gently over a slow fire 
until it becomes as thick as honey. Put it into small jars, and 
keep it in a cool, dry place. 

ORANGES AND LEMONS WHOLE. 

Make a syrup of three pounds of sugar-candy in one quart of 
water; put good and sound oi'anges in this, and then boil very 
slowly till the liquid is reduced to one-half. Lemons may be 
treated in the same way. When fold and put away in jars, stir 
in a wineglassful of rum for every pint made. N. B. — They will 
not " keep " long, unless under lock and key. 

SIBERIAN CRABS. 

Prick each apple two or three times with a fork, and throw 
them into a pan of water. Simmer them either in water or a very 
weak syrup made with a pound of sugar to a pint and a half of 
water. When the skins begin to crack, take them from the fire, 
strain the s> r rup or water from them, and put them into jars. 
Cover them with a weak syrup whilst boiling hot, made with a 
pound and a half of sugar, with a pint of water. In three or four 
days pour off the syrup, boil it again with six or eight ounces 
more sugar to each pint of water used v and pour over whilst boil- 
ing. Repeat this three times, and put them aside for use. Ex- 
amine them in about three or four weeks, and if there is the least 
indication of fermentation pour off the syrup; boil it as before 



HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



with more sugar ; take off any scum ; give the apples a boil in the 
syrup ; fill the jars, and tie them over with paper or bladder when 
cold. 

SUMMER FRUITS. 

Such fruits as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and the 
like, may be preserved in the following manner cheaply, and 
their flavor be retained :— Put sugar over the fire, at the rate of 
half a pound to a pound of berries, add a little water, and when 
hot take up the fruit in a skimmer and dip it into the sugar, hold- 
ing it there for half a minute perhaps ; then take it out and spread 
it on the tins. Go through the whole lot in this manner. Then 
boil down the sugar to a thick syrup, and pour it over the fruit. 
Set the tins either in the sun or in a warm oven till the berries 
are dried through in thin gelatinous cakes. When thoroughly 
dry put the cakes in a bag and hang it out of the way. The cakes 
will keep as long as wanted, and may be used in a few minutes by 
the addition of a little hot water— more sugar being added if nee 
essary. The beauty of this mode is that the flavor of the fruit is 
retained, while there is no danger of its spoiling by fermentation. 
Fruits, when preserved in the usual way— pound for pound— are 
made too sweet, and lose their distinctive flavor so much that it 
differs little whether it is preserved peach or potato. Besides, 
without care, preserves are apt to ferment and spoil. 



BOTTLED FRUIT. 

FOR TARTS, WITHOUT SUGAR. 

Take wide-mouthed glass, or, if possible, stone bottles; fill them, 
by shaking, or even, if you like, by pressing them with a round 
stick like a ruler. Then cork them tight with the best corks (for 
good corking is more than half the battle), using good deep chives 
as they are called; wire down the cork strongly, and insert a 
small slip of wood between the wire and cork. Place the bottles 
upright in a boiler filled with cold water, up to their neck; heat 
the water until it boils; keep it boiling ten minutes, and then 
withdraw the fire, or move the boiler off it. When the water 
is cool, take out the bottles, and they will keep for years. They 
may be rosined; but with good corks it is needless, and is after- 
wards troublesome. 

CHERRIES, ETC. 

Take the common red cherries, and remove the stones. Put 
them in wide-mouthed, light glass bottles. Then set the bottles 
in a boiler of cold water, within an inch or so of the neck. 
Let them boil from fifteen to twenty minutes. Put the corks 
in the bottles as tightly as possible while the water is boiling. 
Then take out the bottles, tighten the corks, and seal them 
with a wax made of equal quantities of rosin and beeswax. 
This method has proved quite satisfactory. The rationale of 
the process will be readily perceived. The heat coagulates the 
albumen of the fruit, and arrests all change which may have 
taken place by the absorption of oxygen, and at the same time 



HOW TO PICKLE AND PRESERVE. 



expels the air from the bottles. The corks, being put in while 
the bottles are filled with steam, and quickly tightened and 
sealed, effectually exclude the air, and with it all exciting 
cause of fermentation. The reason why the bottles are placed in 
cold water is to prevent them from breaking. If tin cans are 
used there will be no need of this precaution. Sometimes, too, 
the bottles break after being taken out of the water, and it is 
advisable to wrap a cloth round them for a few minutes. 

GREEN GOOSEBERRIES AND CURRANTS. 

Green gooseberries and currants may be preserved in the same 
way, except that they do not need so much boiling. If the bot- 
tles are heated sufficiently to drive out most of the air by expan- 
sion, and carefully corked and sealed while hot, nothing more 
will be required. In fact, they are sometimes kept b}' simply 
putting them in tightly-sealed bottles without any boiling. In 
this case the gooseberries, not being ripe, absorb the ox3 r gen 
from the small quantity of air in the bottles, without injury. 
If the bottles, after being sealed, are placed in hot water for' a 
few minutes, this absorption of oxygen takes place much more 
rapidly with the formation of carbonic acid. Unless the fruit 
is quite green the former method is undoubtedly the best. 

Green gooseberries are frequently preserved by placing them, 
when dry, in a stone ;jar or other vessel, and burying it in the 
soil, below the reach of frost. 

DAMSONS. 

For tills purpose they should be gathered before they are 

Suite ripe, on a dry day," and after the dew is dried off them, 
lottle them as soon as' possible after they are gathered, and let 
the bottles in which they are to be put be perfectly dry. 

All bruised or damaged fruit should be carefully picked out 
as the bottles are being filled. When quite full, cork them 
with good sound corks, such as are made for the purpose 
(not bungs), rather slightly, and place them in a boiler or deep 
saucepan, with cold water to reach half way up the necks of the 
bottles. Heat the water gradually to the boiling point, and after 
being kept at this heat for two or three minutes, withdraw the 
fire and let them cool in the water. When quite cold, cork close- 
ly, and place them in a cool dry place for use. When preserved 
in this way they will be found equal to fresh fruit for pies, pud- 
dings, tarts, or any other purpose for which fresh fruit is re- 
quired, and will keep good for two or three years. Filling the bot- 
tles with water is a bad practice, as it deprives the fruit of much 
of its flavor, and does not contribute anything to their preser- 
vation.
