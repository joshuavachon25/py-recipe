INTRODUCTION TO NEW EDITION 

The success of the previous editions of this book, and 
its recommendation by the medical profession, has 
induced the authors to give to the public in this new 
edition the benefit of their extended experience ; 
fifty new recipes having been added, and the old ones 
carefully revised. For those who cannot take sugar, 
and do not like saccharine, there are several entirely 
new recipes for sweet dishes in which neither is used ; 
and yet they are sweet enough for any ordinary palate. 
There are recipes also for several beverages, amongst 
which will be found directions for making a Nut drink, 
which is a stimulant, and a good substitute for tea and 
coffee. 

As very few people can take their food without salt, 
it has been considered advisable to add it to the recipes 
in this edition, no particular quantity being specified, 
this being left to the discretion of the patient ; it must, 
however, be borne in mind that a little salt is better 
than much. 

The authors wish to thank Mrs. Emily Green for her 
care and patience in testing many of their recipes, and 
for helping them to make many very troublesome 
experiments. 



INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST 
EDITION 

This little book has been written in the hope 
that it may be of help to those who live upon the 
" Uric-acid-free - diet, for the cure of all uric acid 
troubles. 

As the author of this diet advises all his patients to 
live upon the plainest food, and to eschew, as far as 
possible, all condiments, it may be thought that in 
many of the recipes which follow, the authors have paid 
too much attention to making the dishes resemble those 
containing meat, fish, &c. This has been done, how- 
ever, to help those who, having lived up to middle age 
upon highly seasoned and stimulating foods, find it 
difficult, if not impossible, at first, to give up condi-; 
ments ; and it has been thought better to wean them 
from the old diet in this way, rather than to allow 
them to suffer from loss of appetite, and its conse- 
quences. Although other condiments have been given 
in the recipes, salt has been omitted ; because the 
author is of opinion that it causes retention of uric acid. 
If, however, patients, at first, find that they cannot 
do without it, their cooks can easily add what they 
require. 

There are many dishes amongst the various recipes 
given which will not be suitable to all digestions ; but, 



xii THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

as patients are the best judges themselves of what they 
are able to digest, there is a large variety given them 
to select from. Most patients will do well to leave out 
any dish containing tomato during the very cold 
weather, or to choose those only which contain a large 
proportion of potato, to counteract the acid of the 
tomato. It is well also to remember in arranging a 
dinner, that if there is any acid in the savoury the 
sweet would be better without fruit. A few menus 
have been arranged to give patients an idea what to 
choose for dinner, &c. ; and a little intelligent attention 
to these, and to the table of food values, ought to make 
it easy for any patients to cater for themselves, without 
running any great risk of either over or under feeding. 
The number of grains of albumen contained in some of 
the dishes is given with the recipes for the same, and 
these will no doubt help the patients in any calculations 
they may wish to make of the food value of other dishes. 
Intelligence, however, must be brought to bear upon 
the subject ; the patients who " have minds above such 
vulgar details " will come badly off upon this diet, un- 
less they are fortunate enough either to have some one 
about them whose minds will bend to " vulgarities," 
or appetites and digestions so good, that they can live 
upon the simpler forms of food, upon which it would 
be impossible for any normal being to over feed. 

To those whose attention has been directed to the 
nourishing values of foods, apart from the " Uric-acid- 
free " diet, the amount of ignorance displayed even by 
those whose duty it should be to guide others, is 
astonishing. For instance, how often one hears of 
medical men telling their patients to take " as much 



INTRODUCTION xiii 

milk as they can drink ! " without inquiring whether 
they happen to be the kind of people who can take any 
given quantity, or explaining to them the amount of 
nourishment contained in milk, and the consequent 
danger to health when it is taken in large quantities, 
in conjunction with other foods. Doctors complain 
that the generaUty of their patients will have drugs j 
though they would often be better without them ; but 
when medical men begin to study, and teach the 
chemical properties of foods, they will soon cease to be 
looked upon as mere dispensers of drugs. 

One valuable article of food — cheese — has now a very 
bad reputation for its supposed indigestible qualities ; 
whereas in the days of our grandfathers, when people 
drank less tea, and ate less stimulating food, it was 
supposed to assist digestion. Perhaps then it was 
treated rightly — as a reUsh to bread — and not eaten in 
large quantities ; whereas now, tastes have become so 
vitiated by over indulgence in highly stimulating foods, 
that when it is taken, it is rather as cheese and bread 
than as bread and cheese. The habit of eating it after 
the digestion has been sufficiently tried by quantities of 
butcher's meat, has also had much to do with its evil 
reputation ; and when discomfort and pain follows, it is, 
of course, always put down to the cheese ! An amusing 
experience in support of this occurred quite recently to 
a gentleman who has hved upon this diet for some 
years. He had been spending the morning with a 
friend, busily employed in the open air, and they both 
returned to their hotel to lunch, with the best of 
appetites. 

The man on the " Uric-acid-free " diet ordered a 



xiv THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

" Welsh Rabbit," while his friend was provided with a 
large plate of roast beef, and a second helping. When 
the " Welsh Rabbit " appeared, he said to the 
" Dieter," " Ah ! you are not to be pitied after all," 
and he ordered the waiter to bring him one also ; and 
whilst it was being prepared, he passed the time by 
partaking of boiled fruit pudding, with suet crust. 
When it appeared he fell to, as if he had taken nothing 
particular since breakfast, and cleared the dish, which 
must have contained from four to six ounces of cheese ! 
The " Dieter," meanwhile, had taken what he required 
of his " Welsh Rabbit," with his bread. 

During the afternoon the friend became exceedingly 
uncomfortable, and, turning to the " Dieter," he ex- 
claimed : " That diet of yours may suit you. I must 
say that you look very well on it ; but my digestion 
won't stand it ; I feel awfully bad ! " 

One hears much about the waste of food amongst the 
lower classes through ignorance, and no doubt if they 
had the knowledge to prepare their food properly, they 
would be well nourished at half the cost ; but has any 
one ever calculated the cost of the enormous waste of 
food amongst the well-to-do, caused by over feeding, 
and improper diet, to say nothing of the cost of trying 
to get rid of the results of both ? Let us hope that a 
time is coming when children will be taught something 
of the values and properties of foods at school, in the 
place of many sinatterings of subjects that are of 
neither use nor interest to them. Perhaps then we 
shall approach the time when it will be as " bad form " 
to eat more than is necessary as it is now to drink more 
than is good for one. 



INTRODUCTION xv 

Those, however, who have suffered much on the old 
diet, and are willing and anxious to try this treatment, 
will, the writers hope, be helped by their experience to 
find a diet amongst the various recipes, suitable to 
their needs. A little patience will be required before 
the patient becomes accustomed to the change of food ; 
but this will be well rewarded by the freedom from 
pain and discomfort, as the diet gradually improves 
the state of the blood. This improvement naturally 
takes a little time to effect ; for a state of things that 
has taken long to bring about, cannot be expected to 
be cured in a few weeks. One lady who was suffering 
from troubles, which this diet is known to relieve, was 
persuaded to give up tea as a preparation for eventually 
going upon the diet ; she did so for two days, and 
finding it depressing went back to her old habits, 
because " she was sure the diet would not suit her ! " 
She must have been either one of the strange mortals 
who " enjoy " bad health, or her sufferings could not 
have been very acute, if they were easier to bear than 
a few days of depression. 

This book is simply a cookery book for the diet ; it is 
not its province to explain the medical foundations of 
the " Uric-acid-free " diet, which are explained in the 
scientific writings of its originator. The writers have, 
however, thought it advisable and helpful to give the 
following extracts from a useful leaflet by the author of 
the system : 

" It is just as impossible to keep up strength and nutrition 
without nitrogen as without oxygen. 

" We generally depend for our nitrogen upon substances 
containing albumens, and it is the habit of this country at 



xvi THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

the present day to get it almost entirely from animal 
albumens, in ignorant disregard of tlie poison that animal 
tissues contain. 

" It can be calculated from the data given in works on 
Physiology that a man, in order to get enough nitrogen, 
must be supplied with from 8 to 11 grs. of albmnen per 
day for each pound of body weight. Children require 
more ; thus a child of 35 lbs. weight may require as much 
as an adult three times its weight, and this gradually 
diminishes until the adult standard is reached ; while old 
and sedentary people may require considerably less than 
the adult allowance. 

" And now, applying the rule of the relation of albumen 
to body weight : — 

" A young adult weighing (after deducting weight of 
clothing) ten stone, or 140 lbs., and leading a hard-working 
life, would have to consume 140 x 10 = 1400 grs. of albumen 
per day, and these might be got as follows : — 

17 ozs. bread (8 per cent, albu- 
mens = 34 grs. per oz.) . . = 578 grs. 

2 pints mUk (3 per cent, albu- 
mens = 13 grs. per oz.) . 1. = 525 grs. 

1 oz. cheese (33 per cent, al- > 

bumens = 140 grs. per oz.) . '. = 140 grs. 

2 ozs. rice (5 per cent, albu- 
mens =21 grs. per oz.) . . = 43 grs. 

14 oz. vegetables and fruit 
(2 per cent, albumens = 
8 grs. per oz.) . . . . = 114 grs. 



1400 grs. 

" If this man lives and works in the open air, he may 
have such a good appetite for bread, macaroni, rice, 



INTRODUCTION xvii 

potatoes, nuts and fruit, that no milk and cheese will be 
required ; but those who live in towns and are more 
sedentary, will generally require to add these latter to a 
greater or less extent." 

A few hints on cooking have also been given, as most 
of the dishes depend largely upon their careful prepara- 
tion for their appetising properties. When the com- 
paratively small range of foods which the diet allows is 
remembered, the difficulties of the authors in arranging 
the combination of foods and vegetables will be appre- 
ciated. In vegetarian cookery the range is much 
larger, hence the number of recipes which the books can 
boast. If, however, they were debarred from using the 
yolks of eggs, asparagus, mushrooms, and the whole of 
the pulses in their savouries, and chocolate and coffee 
in their sweets, the number of recipes would be con- 
siderably diminished. 

The authors are indebted to various friends for certain 
recipes, which they have kindly supplied, and which 
have been adapted to the diet ; and especially to their 
respective cooks, for the intelligent interest and 
patience which they have shown in the working out of 
all the recipes. 



HINTS ON COOKING 

It is as necessary to most people for their food to look 
nice as it is that it should have an agreeable taste ; and 
although on this diet the cook has not the materials for 
much show, it is all the more important that she should 
make the best of what she has. If care is taken in 
following the recipes given, both the eye and the palate 
will be gratified ; and the cook will have the satisfac- 
tion of knowing that the result is mainly due to her 
careful cooking. Indeed, this diet, though it would 
seem at first sight to give the cook but few opportuni- 
ties for showing her talents, yet gives her every chance 
of exercising both her taste and her ingenuity. 

As milk enters largely into the dishes which she has 
to prepare, one of the first things to impress upon the 
cook is the keeping of it fresh and sweet. It must 
never remain uncovered in the larder, as it will im- 
mediately take the flavour of anything that happens to 
be near it ; and if it is put in the ice chest in hot weather 
it must never be placed in the same compartment with 
either fruit or vegetables. Strawberries will impart a 
very disagreeable flavour to milk, if it stands uncovered 
anywhere near them ; any article of food that has the 
least smell will spoil its flavour, so that the only remedy 
is to keep milk carefully covered. 

The greatest possible care should also be taken with 



XX THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

the saucepans, &c., in which it is cooked. Aluminium 
saucepans are the best for this purpose, for the milk is 
not so liable to burn in them as it is in enamelled 
saucepans, and they are much easier to keep clean. 
Although the first cost is much greater than the 
enamelled saucepans, in the end they are certainly 
cheaper, for there is no enamel to wear off or become 
cracked. The cook must remember in cleaning them 
that no soda must be used or they will turn black ; if 
they are allowed to remain in plain water, there will be 
no difl&culty whatever in cleaning them. They are to 
be bought at the Army and Navy Stores, or from any 
good ironmonger. 

The French fireproof ware will be found very good in 
the cooking of all dishes in which milk is used, and for 
stewing fruit. The " Marmites " have the advantage 
of being cheap, and also of being very easily kept clean. 
The fireproof china dishes, &c., are a little more expen- 
sive, but they look very nice, and various savoury 
dishes which are sent to table in the utensils in which 
they are cooked look best when served in them. The 
milk boilers for use at table — which cannot boil over — 
are made in this ware, and are admirable in every way. 
A very good selection of these useful utensils is always 
to be found at the Army and Navy Stores. Double 
pans will also be found very convenient. Indeed, for 
the cooking of porridge and the preparation of many of 
the dishes containing milk for which recipes are given, 
they may almost be termed indispensable. The 
danger of burning is avoided, and only careless stupidity 
in neglecting to keep the outer pan filled with water 
could produce that most disagreeable of dishes, burnt 



HINTS ON COOKING xxi 

porridge. The pans are now quite inexpensive, and 
can be procured at any good ironmongers. 

Soups made with milk, if carefully prepared, are 
delicious ; and many meat-eaters confess that they like 
them quite as well as those made from stock prepared 
in the usual way. They are especially valuable on this 
diet, for the patient takes part of the milk prescribed 
in this agreeable way. All the soups for which recipes 
are given are made with milk, except a few ; and those 
have cheese amongst the ingredients, which brings them 
up to the milk soups in nourishing value. Care must 
he taken to follow out the recipes exactly if the soups are 
to be successful. 

Cheddar cheese must always be used where it is given 
in the recipes, for if Parmesan and various other cheeses 
are substituted, they will become a sticky mass at the 
bottom of the tureen. Onions must always be fried 
when the direction is given ; for if this detail is neg- 
lected, it will make all the difference between success 
and failure in the flavour of the soup. The thickening 
of the soups is also a very important matter ; and when 
it is possible, brown or white roux — according to the 
colour of the soup — should always be used instead of 
flour. Full directions for making these thickenings for 
soups, sauces, and gravies are given ; and when the 
cook has once realised the immense saving in time, and 
the improvement to her soup in flavour, where roux is 
used, she will not grudge the half-hour or so spent in 
preparing it, say, once a month. Many cooks, and 
writers upon cookery, say that the difference in flavour 
when a soup or sauce is thickened with roux instead of 
flour is as great as the difference between baked and 



xxii THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

raw pastry ! This illustration may be exaggerated, but 
the difference is undoubtedly very great ; and as every 
help is required to make the soups palatable, cooks will 
do well always to keep on hand a stock of white and 
brown roux. Some housekeepers may think its pre- 
paration extravagant, but if the dabs of butter and the 
flour thickenings — many of them half wasted — which 
are generally used to thicken soups and sauces, were all 
added up, the extravagance would certainly be on the 
side of the latter methods. When soups, sauces, or 
gravies require to be browner than the brown roux or 
fried onion makes them, a little Parisian Essence is the 
best browning to use for this purpose. It is simply 
burnt sugar sold at all grocers by that name, and will 
be found much more convenient and economical than 
any home-made preparation. 

There is another important thing in connection with 
soups that the cook should always bear in mind, and 
that is the seasoning. Soup, while it should always be 
tasty, should never be highly seasoned. Ground pepper 
should never be used, as mistakes are very liable to 
occur, and the soup made too hot. If peppercorns — 
black or white, according to the colour of the soup — 
are used, the agreeable flavour of the pepper is given, 
without any fear of the soup being spoiled by being 
too hot. Ground pepper has another disagreeable pro- 
perty when used in soups ; it sinks to the bottom, and 
the last person served often gets more than his share, 
A cook must remember that there is a wide difference 
between the seasoning of sauces and soups. A sauce or 
gravy must always be well seasoned, as it is intended as 
a relish, and unless it is distinctive, it does not serve its 



HINTS ON COOKING 



XXUl 



purpose ; but the same seasoning in a soup, which is 
taken in larger quantities, would be quite out of place, 
and very disagreeable. 

Perhaps the most important item in this diet is the 
bread, and no pains should be spared to have it of the 
best, and of various kinds. Baker's bread, when it is 
good, is very useful for toast and bread-crumbs ; but 
bread to eat with other foods is best when home-made. 

The American bread-maker, mentioned in the recipe 
for bread, is a most valuable invention. It is called 
" The Three Minutes Bread-Maker," and can be 
obtained from the Stores or any good ironmonger ; it 
really kneads the bread perfectly in that time. If the 
instructions given in recipe No. 422 are carefully 
followed, the result will be really good and appetising 
bread, which keeps good for a week. Many experi- 
ments were made before the amount of yeast, &c., 
was decided upon ; and in the recipe the least possible 
quantity, consistent with light bread, is given. Bread 
keeps better if made in tins ; but if it is to be eaten 
within three days after making, it may be made into 
round loaves and baked on the oven shelves. 

All pieces of bread, and crusts cut from toast, pro- 
vided that these are not burnt, should be saved, and 
every two or three days they should be put in a tin in 
the oven — which must not be too hot — and baked 
until they are a light brown all through. They should 
then be crushed with a rolling-pin on a pastry-board 
until they are quite fine, and put away in a biscuit or 
other covered tin, which should be kept for that 
purpose. 

Another preparation of dried bread-crumbs, called 



xxiv THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

" Rusk-crumbs," will also be found very useful. 
Recipes for many dishes are given in which these 
raspings and rusk-crumbs are used, and it is well to 
have a supply always on hand. 

The " Apsley Rusks " are a grateful change from 
bread and toast when carefully prepared according to 
the recipe given. The cook must not, however, be 
sparing of her trouble, for if the bread is not cut thin 
the result will not be good. 

Various recipes are given for the making of paste for 
tarts, &c., which can be made with either butter or 
Coker butter, the latter being a nut butter, excellent for 
all cooking purposes, and can be procured from Messrs. 
T. J. Bilson and Co., 88 Gray's Inn Road, W.C. It is 
cheaper than salad oil for frying, and makes very good 
pastry. Recipe No. 436 for Puff paste is a very old 
recipe, which has been used in one of the authors' 
family for over a hundred years. It is a lesson to the 
modern housewife in care and patience ; but the result 
is so excellent that it is quite worth the little extra 
trouble bestowed upon it. The only alteration that 
has been made in the original recipe is the addition of 
baking-powder, which can be left out if desired. It is 
the best description of the method of making paste 
that the authors have met with ; and with this, many 
cooks, who have used it, quite agree. 

Frying is an art in which it is necessary for all cooks 
to excel ; and it is really a very simple process if a little 
thought and common sense are brought to bear upon 
it. The great thing is to have the fat at the right 
temperature, so that a coating is immediately formed 
round the substance fried, to prevent the fat soaking 



HINTS ON COOKING xxv 

into it, which would cause it to be greasy and indi- 
gestible. The fat should be quite still before the 
article to be fried is put into it. Cooks soon learn the 
exact moment it is ready ; but the inexperienced will 
find it a great help if, when they think the fat is hot 
enough, they put in it a small piece of bread. If the 
bread immediately takes a pale yellow colour, and is 
crisp, the fat is ready, and should be used at once. 
An inverted sieve placed on a plate on the stove should 
always be ready to receive the article that is fried. 
The fat then drains away immediately, and leaves the 
article crisp. 

It is weU to mention the error which many cooks fall 
into in the cooking of macaroni, and all Italian pastes, 
by soaking them. All Italian pastes should be thrown 
into plenty of boiling water, and boiled as quickly 
as possible for some minutes, no matter how they are to 
be cooked after. The time to boil them in this way 
depends on the kind of macaroni, &c. Genoa macaroni 
takes half an hour in water, and Naples only twenty 
minutes ; the smaller kinds according to size, vermicelli 
taking only five minutes. This boiling in water must 
always precede the cooking in milk, gravy, &c., if the 
macaroni is to be a successful dish. 

Onions are a most useful and appetising addition to 
many dishes, especially on this diet ; but many people 
find that they disagree with them. If, however, the 
cook before using them for any dish would first put 
them into cold water and bring them quickly to boiling- 
point, and let them boil for two or more minutes, 
according to the size of the onion, they would then be 
found to agree with the most delicate digestion. This 



xxvi THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

should be done first, no matter how the onions are to 
be cooked afterwards ; and, of course, they must be 
well drained before proceeding to do anything else with 
them. 

One often hears complaints about the salad oil for 
salads ; often, however, it is not the oil which is to 
blame at all, but the vinegar. Malt vinegar should 
never be used with oil, for it imparts an exceedingly 
disagreeable flavour to the salad, for which the oil is 
often blamed. If the same oil is used in conjunction 
with French vinegar the flavour will generally be found 
to be quite right. The best oil should always be used 
for salads, &c. ; there is another oil for frying quite 
good enough for the purpose, and much cheaper. 

Care should be taken in mixing salads to use as little 
vinegar as possible. The recipes give the proportion, 
but some people would be better with even less ; be- 
cause it is the vinegar in the salad which generally 
disagrees with people. Let the lettuce be quite dry — it 
should be tossed in a cloth after washing and draining — 
and it must be torn with the fingers into suitable pieces 
for eating. Lettuce should never be cut. A bit of onion 
should always be added, but care should be taken that 
it is finely minced in the bowl in which the salad is 
mixed. It is best scalded first if the salad is for a 
delicate person. 

A nut-mill is almost a necessity for anyone hving on 
this diet ; for even if nuts are not largely used, almonds 
for flavouring are always better for going through the 
mill before they are pounded. The nut-mills supplied 
by T. J. Bilson and Co., 88 Gray's Inn Road, London, 
W.C.,have been found by the authors to be very good. 



HINTS ON COOKING 



XXVll 



There are a few things that should never be neglected 
by cooks who prepare the food for this diet, which may 
be enumerated as follows : 
Don't neglect — ^To weigh the articles carefully, in 
the proportions given in the 
recipes. 
To fry onions well for flavouring. 
To skin tomatoes whenever the 

recipe prescribes it. 
To wash and dry lettuces well for 

salad. 
To tear and not cut lettuce. 
To scald and mince the onion well 

for salads. 
To wash all vegetables with the 

greatest care. 
To keep all utensils perfectly clean.

corns in the milk and bring it to boiling-point. Then 
add the onions, and let them simmer for an hour. In 
the meantime, boil the artichokes until quite tender, 
which should be in twenty minutes or half an hour ; 
rub them through a sieve, with the onion which has 
been stewed in the milk. Strain the milk, and stir it 
into the artichoke until it is quite smooth. 

Now return the soup to the pan and let it boil up ; 
thicken it with the white roux, or the corn flour which

cold milk. (See " Hints on Cooking.") Boil the soup 
up again, and serve either with croutons or toasted 
bread cut in dice.

ten minutes, then add them to the milk with the bay 
leaves and peppercorns, sprinkle in the barley, and let 
it cook slowly for four hours in a double saucepan, 
removing any scum that rises; pass through a fine 
sieve (do not press it), return to the saucepan, and add

saucepan to get hot on the stove. Fry the onion in 
the butter until a very pale yellow (it must not brown), 
add it to the milk, let it boil up, and then simmer for 
an hour. Rub the carrots through a sieve. Remove 
the peppercorns from the milk— squeezing the muslin 
well in doing so to extract the flavour. Pour the milk 
through the sieve and rub the onion through. Mix 
smoothly, and return the soup to the saucepan and boil 
it up. Thicken with either the white roux or the corn 
flour. If the corn flour is used, be careful to mix it 
smoothly first with cold milk. Then boil up again, 
and serve with either fried croutons or toasted bread

8. Celery Soup (No. 2). 

Ingredients. 



One good head of Celery. 
One quart of Milk. 
One dozen white Peppercorns. 
Half an ounce of Butter. 



A tablespoonful of white Bonx 
or a teaspoonful of Corn 
Flour. 

Two ounces of Onion, 



Salt and Pepper to taste. 

Wash a good sized head of celery and cut it up into 
pieces two inches long. Put it into a saucepan with 
the milk and the peppercorns tied in a musUn, leave 
room for the milk to get into the musUn so that the 
flavour of the pepper can be extracted. Let it get hot 
on the stove. In the meantime fry the onion in the 
butter a pale yellow — it must not brown — and add it 
to the milk. Let it boil, then simmer until the celery 
is tender, which should be in an hour or less. Remove 
the peppercorns, and rub the whole through a sieve. 
Return to the saucepan and boil up. Thicken with 
either roux or corn flour. If the corn flour is used, it 
must be first smoothly mixed with a very Uttle cold 
milk. (See " Hints on Cooking.") Serve with croutons 
of fried bread. 

9. Celery Soup (Brown). 



Three nice heads of Celery. 
One Spanish Onion. 
Half a pint of Cream. 



One quart of Milk. 
Three Bay leaves. 
Salt and Pepper to taste. 



Wash the celery well, and use only the white parts : 
scald the onion, and fry the celery and onion in a little 
butter or Coker butter until a nice brown colour is 
obtained. Put a pint and a half of the milk into a 



6 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

double saucepan, and when it boils, put in the fried 
celery and onion, and keep it boiling until the mixture 
becomes a pulp. Then pass through a sieve, and add 
the cream to the mixture. While these have been 
cooking, the other half-pint of milk should have been 
boiling separately with the bay leaves ; take out the 
bay leaves and add the milk to the rest of the mixture, 
also a little salt and pepper. Put all back into the 
saucepan to get very hot, and serve. 



10. Cheese Soup. 

Ingredients. 



Eight tablespoonfuls of grated 
diy Cheddar Cheese. 

Four tablespoonfuls of Bread- 
crumbs. 

One and a half ounces of Butter. 



Four ounces of Onions. 
One quart of Water. 
One spot of Parisian Essence. 
Twelve black Peppercorns. 
Salt and Pepper to taste. 



Slice the onions and throw them into a saucepan of 
cold water, let them boil up very quickly, then drain 
and mince them finely and fry them in the butter 
to a . nice rich brown ; but they must not on any 
account burn. Now add the water, which must be 
boiling, and the pepper tied loosely on a bit of musUn ; 
let them boil up quickly and simmer for half an hour. 
Mix the bread-crumbs and cheese and put them at the 
bottom of a warm soup tureen. Remove the mushn 
containing the peppercorns from the soup, and squeeze 
well to extract all the flavour. Add a spot of Parisian 
Essence. Boil up again and pour over the bread- 
crumbs and cheese in the tureen, stirring all the time 
the soup is being poured in. Let the tureen remain one 
minute before the fire, and if any skin forms on the top 



SOUPS AND PUREES 7 

it should be removed carefully before serving ; this, 
however, should be done very quickly as the soup must 
be served very hot. Parisian Essence is simply burnt 
sugar, which is sold under the former name at all 
grocers ; it is much more convenient and economical 
than a home-made preparation. (See " Hints on 
Cooking.") 

11. Cucumber Puree. 

Ingredients. 



Two large Cucumbera. 

One quart of Milk. 

One ounce of Butter, 

One and a half ounces of Flour. 



One tablespoonful of grated 

Onion. 
One tablespoonful of Cream. 
Salt and Pepper to taste. 



Peel and cut the cucumber into two-inch lengths 
(remove the seeds if old cucumbers are used). Put the 
milk into a double saucepan and bring it to the boil, 
then add the cucumber and let it cook for twenty 
minutes ; add the onion, salt, pepper, and butter. Mix 
the flour to a smooth paste in a little cold water ; add 
this and allow all to boil for ten minutes, stirring all the 
time. Let it stand for a few minutes, add the cream, 
and serve with fried croutons. 

12. Leek Soup (White). 

Ingredients. 



Four Leeks. 
One quart of Milk. 
One ounce of Butter. 
Twelve white Peppercorns. 



One tablespoonful of white 
Boux, or a dessertspoonful 
of Com Flour. 

Four Cloves. 



Salt and Pepper to taste. 
Prepare the leeks exactly as in the following recipe 
until the frying in the butter, when they must not be 
allowed to get brown, but only a light yellow. Then 



8 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

add them to the milk, which must have been heating on 
the stove, with the white peppercorns tied loosely in 
muslin. Let them boil up, and then simmer for an 
hour. Remove the cloves and peppercorns. Thicken 
with either the white roux or the corn flour. If the 
corn flour is used, it must be first mixed smoothly with 
a little cold milk. (See " Hints on Cooking.") Let it 
boil up, and serve with toasted bread cut in dice. 



13. Leek Soup (Brown). 

Ingredients. 



Four Leeks. 
One quart of Water. 
Eight tablespoonfuls of grated 
dry Cheddar Cheese. 



One and a half ounces ot 

Butter. 
One spot of Parisian Essence. 
Twelve black Peppercorns. 



Salt to taste. 

Remove the outer leaves and trim the roots of the 
leeks. Divide them lengthwise into quarters, and cut 
them into pieces an inch long. Wash them quite free 
from grit — be very careful about this, as they are diffi- 
eult to wash. Put them into cold water, and bring 
them quickly to boiling-point ; let them boil three 
minutes. Drain them, and fry in the butter a light 
brown. Now put them in a saucepan with the water 
and the black peppercorns loosely tied in muslin ; let 
them boil up quickly and then simmer gently for an 
hour. Remove the peppercorns and squeeze the muslin 
well, to extract all the flavour. Put the grated cheese 
at the bottom of a warm soup tureen. Pour the soup, 
which must have boiled up again — over the cheese, 
stirring all the time, and serve with toasted bread cut in 
dice.

quickly for an hour, when it will be tender enough to 
cut into small pieces about a quarter of an inch long. 
Slice the onions and put them into cold water, bring 
them to boiling-point as quickly as possible, then drain 
them and mince finely. Now fry them in the butter a 
nice brown — not too dark — and stir them into the 
water, which must be boiling. Add the black pepper- 
corns tied in muslin, and simmer for half an hour. 
Take out the peppercorns and squeeze the muslin to 
extract all the flavour. Put in the bits of macaroni.

well as pipe macaroni.

Ingredients. 

Six tablespoonfula of cold curried I Three Bay leaves. 

vegetables. | One pint and a half of Water. 

Salt to taste. 

Any curried vegetables left over from the day before 
will come in nicely for this soup. Pass them through a 
sieve, and put into a saucepan with the water. If the 
spup is liked very strong it will be well to add another 
teaspoonful of curry-powder ; mix it in a little cold 
water first, then add to the mixture with the bay leaves 
and let it simmer for about half an hour. Remove the 
bay leaves, and serve with plain boiled rice. Grated 
Parmesan cheese should be served with this soup.

and cloves, and boil for one and a half hours ; then 
pass all through a sieve and put into the remainder of 
the milk (1 J pints), which should be boiling (in a double 
saucepan). Thicken with a tablespoonful of potato 
flour, and serve very hot. A little butter and cream can 
be added if liked.

Half an ounce of Butter.

the vegetables get brown. Now add the milk which 
must be boiling, and the peppercorns tied loosely in a 
bit of muslin. Let them stew very gently for an hour, 
then pour into a wire sieve and rub all the vegetables

is already boiling, and put the macaroni and butter 
with the milk — which should be boiling — ^in the inner 
pan. Let it cook for an hour, stirring it occasionally. 
While the macaroni is cooking the apples should be 
stewed with the sugar until quite tender and free from 
lumps. When the macaroni is cooked, drain from it 
two tablespoonfuls of milk and put it aside. Lay the 
macaroni at the bottom of a pie-dish and spread the 
stewed apples over it ; then put the dish where it will 
keep warm without cooking. Now put the grated 
cheese with the two tablespoonfuls of milk previously 
put aside, in a small saucepan ; stir quickly over the 
fire or a gas ring, until the cheese is melted and quite 
smooth ; then spread it over the apple and serve as 
quickly as possible.

101. Macaroni with Cheese 

Ingredients, 

Four ounces of Macaroni. I Half a pint of Milk. 

Four ounces of grated Cheese. | One ounce of Butter. 
Salt and Pepper. 

Break the macaroni into two-inch lengths, throw it 
into plenty of fast boiling water, and let it boil quickly 
for half an hour. Now drain it, and add the milk with 
a little salt and pepper, bring it to boiling-point 
quickly, and then let it simmer gently for another half- 
hour. The macaroni should be perfectly tender, but 
unbroken, and the cheese and butter may now be added, 
stirring the contents of the stewpan continuously — one 
direction — ^until the whole of the cheese is melted and 
thoroughly mixed with the macaroni. Turn it out on 
a dish, and serve as hot as possible. Another way of 
serving the macaroni makes a prettier dish : — Instead 
of adding the cheese and butter to the macaroni in the 
stewpan, a layer of the macaroni may be put at the 
bottom of a well-buttered French baking-dish, and part 
of the cheese scattered over it ; then the rest of the 
macaroni must be put over the cheese, and the re- 
mainder of the cheese used as before. The top should 
be covered with fine bread-crumbs, and the butter 
broken up in bits and placed over the top. The dish 
should now be placed in a hot oven and quickly 
browned. Note. — It is necessary to stir the macaroni 
occasionally when boiling quickly in the water, and 
after the milk has been added, it must be stirred 
frequently, or it will stick to the pan and spoil. (See 
Macaroni, " Hints on Cooking.")

well till bubbles form on the top. Add the rest of the 
milk, and let it stand till the macaroni is cooked. This 
makes the batter lighter. Cut the tomatoes in halves, 
and put them on a buttered baking-tin in a moderate 
oven, with the rest of the ounce of butter in small bits 
on the top of them. Bake till just tender, but not 
broken. Make the salad oil very hot in a saucepan. 
When the macaroni is drained from the water, throw 
four or five bits of it into the hot oil. If it browns 
quickly put in the other bits and fry to a light brown. 
Lift out of the oil, drain on white paper, re-heat the 
oil, and continue to dip in batter and fry in oil all the 
rest of the macaroni. Put the tomatoes in a ring, round 
a deep fire-proof dish. Heap the fried macaroni in the 
centre. Put a border of the grated cheese round the 
outside edge of the ring of tomatoes. Make very hot 
in the oven. Serve at once in the dish in which it was 
baked. 

108. Macaroni Savoury. 

Ingredients, 



Four ounces Macaroni. 
Four ounces Parmesan Cheese. 
Half a pint of Milk, 
Half a pound of Onions. 



Half a pound of Tomatoes. 
Two ounces of Butter. 
Three ounces of Bread-crumbs. 
Salt and Pepper. 



Break the macaroni into two-inch lengths and throw 
it into plenty of fast boiling water and let it boil 
quickly, stirring occasionally, for half an hour, and 
then drain the water from it. Now add the milk with 
pepper, salt and let it boil up quickly, and then simmer 
for another half-hour, when the macaroni should be 
quite tender. Stir very frequently to prevent it stick- 
ing to the pan. 



60 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

The onions in the meantime should have been peeled 
and sliced and boiled until tender, in plenty of water. 
They must then be drained and sUghtly chopped. The 
tomatoes also must be thrown into boiling water for a 
few seconds, and when removed the skins will come off 
quite easily ; they must now be sliced. 

Now butter a good sized French baking-dish and 
scatter in some bread-crumbs ; shake out all that do 
not stick to the butter. Place a layer of the macaroni 
at the bottom of the dish, and scatter over it a third 
part of the Parmesan. Over that, place the chopped 
onions and then the sliced tomatoes, and then the 
remainder of the macaroni. Cover this with half the 
remaining Parmesan, and over that scatter the rest of 
the bread-crumbs. Now scatter the last of the 
Parmesan, and over that the butter broken up into 
small pieces, and place over the top. Bake for about 
twenty minutes in a hot oven ; it should be a rich 
brown all over. This is an excellent dish and well 
repays the cook's trouble, if attention is paid to all the 
details. If Genoa macaroni is used it requires a longer 
time to prepare than Naples. Twenty minutes in the 
water is long enough for Naples. (See " Hints on 
Cooking.") 

109. Macaroni (Scalloped). 

Macaroni may be prepared exactly as in the pre- 
ceding recipe ; but instead of putting it into a French 
baking-dish it may be put in scallops, and the same

129. Rice Boiled for Curry. 

Ingredients, 
Bioe. I Water. | Butter. 

The rice should be picked over but not washed. 
Throw it into plenty of quickly boiling water, and let 
it boil up, and continue to boil quickly for one minute. 
Then pour in a very little cold water to check it. It 
should now boil slowly, but continuously, for fifteen to 
twenty minutes. It is boiled enough if the grains are 
soft when pressed between the thumb and finger. 
Drain it, and return it to the saucepan, which should be 
dried and buttered. Cover it with a clean cloth and 
allow it to steam on the stove, where it is not too hot, or 
in a slow oven. Stir it lightly with a fork and let it 
remain for a quarter of an hour. Each grain should 
then have swelled up and be well separated. 

130. Rice (as cooked in Japan). 

Ingredients. 
One teacupful of Bice. | One teacupful of Water. 

Measure the rice carefully, smoothing the top of the 
grains with the hand to be sure that it is not piled 
above the cup. Wash it well and put it in a saucepan 



SAVOURIES 71 

with a well-fitting lid. Use the same cup in which the 
rice was measured to measure the water, fill it, add it 
to the rice. Place it on the stove, fitting the lid care- 
fully on the saucepan, and watch it until the steam 
comes from under the lid ; then put the saucepan 
where it will not boil, but will steam, for three quarters 
of an hour. The lid must not be removed from the 
saucepan. 

If the instructions are followed the rice will have 
absorbed all the water and will be perfectly cooked. 
Place it on a hot dish on the stove, or before the fire, 
for a few minutes, and toss it lightly with a fork to 
prevent the grains sticking together. 

This is an economical method of cooking rice, as 
none of the nourishing properties are thrown away 
with any excess of water.

Let them stew until the rice has absorbed all the milk, 
which will take quite two hours. Turn the mixture 
into a bowl, and let it get nearly cold. Now stir them, 
with the chopped parsley, into the cooled rice and 
season nicely with salt and pepper. Beat up two of the 
whites of eggs into a stiff froth, and add that also to the 
mixture. Have the other white of egg beaten up 
slightly, take a tablespoonful of the mixture and dip it 
into the egg, then cover it with bread-crumbs. Shape 
them into cutlets an inch thick and put them into the 
frying basket. Fry them a rich brown and garnish 
with parsley. The cutlets are rather difficult to form, 
and a little patience is necessary to make them a 
success ; but they quite repay the cook for her trouble 
when finished. If, however, she is not expert at this 
kind of work, it will be best for her to treat the mixture 
as in recipe for " Savoury Pudding."

166. Vegetable Marrow (Stuffed). 

Ingredients. 

A small Vegetable Marrow. | Forcemeat. 

Half a pint of Gravy. 

Peel a vegetable marrow, not more than eight or nine 
inches long, cut it in halves lengthwise, and remove the 
seeds. Put it into fast boiling salted water, and let it 
boil gently for ten minutes. Lift it carefully, and let 
it drain ; then wipe it with a clean cloth. Have ready 
some forcemeat, and fill the hollow in the middle of one 
half and place the other half on the top. Tie the 
halves together with twine, and lift the marrow care- 
fully into an oval baking-dish. Pour the gravy over 
the marrow, and cover it closely with another dish over 
it. Baste occasionally, and bake for an hour in a hot 
oven. If it is baked in a French baking-dish with 
cover, it can be sent to table in the dish it was baked in. 
If an ordinary dish is used, it would still be better to 
serve in the dish in which it was baked, as the marrow 
might be difficult to remove ; a napkin must be 
fastened round the dish to make it look tidy. Make 
the gravy according to recipe for " Brown Gravy," and

and squeeze in a little lemon-juice just before dishing 
it up. Serve very hot. 

164. Brussels Sprouts (Boiled). 

Pick, trim, and wash the sprouts very carefully. Put 
them into plenty of fast boiling water. The sprouts 
will, of course, check the boiling for a time, but they 
must be brought to a boil as quickly as possible ; 
add a very small bit of soda, and boil very fast for 
fifteen minutes. They must be drained immediately 
they are done, or both colour and flavour will be 
spoiled. 

165. Brussels Sprouts, Dressed with 
Butter.

is best. Prepare and wash it carefully. Put it into 
plenty of fast boiling water with a small bit of soda. 



88 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

The water will, of course, stop boiling when the cabbage 
is put in, but it should be brought to boiling-point as 
quickly as possible. Let it boil until tender, which 
should be in from thirty to forty minutes. Drain well 
and chop it. Stir in the butter ; season nicely with 
salt and pepper, press it into a buttered mould, and 
bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. Turn out, 
and serve. This dish is very nice with little moulds of 
white of egg. (See " White of Egg in Moulds.")

two-thirds should always be potatoes. 

168. Carrots (Stewed). 

Ingredients. 

Two pounds of Canots. | Halt a pint of Brown Gravy. 

Half a teaspoonful of mixed Mustard. 

The carrots should be scraped and washed before 
weighing. Cut them lengthwise into quarters, if large,

into cold water, and let them boil up quickly ; if the 
carrots are old, throw away the water after the first 
fifteen minutes and put them into fresh hot water. 



VEGETABLES 89 

This is unnecessary when the carrots are young ; it is 
also better not to cut the carrots when they are quite 
small, as they look best served whole. Boil them until 
quite tender, which will be in from half an hour to an 
hour, or longer, according to age. Drain them well 
and put them into the gravy. (See " Brown Gravy.") 
Let them stew very gently for twenty minutes. Mix 
the mustard with a little of the gravy, which should be 
cool, and add it to the rest. Serve very hot with fried 
or toasted bread.

boiling oil, or Coker butter. 

170. Cauliflower (Stewed). 

Ingredients. 

A medium-sized Cauliflower. | Half a pint of Brown Gravy. 

Divide the cauliflower into neat pieces and wash these 
well. It is well to put them into vinegar and water for 
a quarter of an hour, as this will be sure to draw out 
the insects. Put them into boiUng water and boil until 
tender, which should be in fifteen or twenty minutes. 
If a little of the stalk is pressed between the finger and 
thumb it can be easily ascertained whether the cauli- 
flower is done. The pieces should remain firm though 
sufficiently cooked. Drain them carefully, and lay 
them in a stewpan with the gravy, and let them stand

and put it with a little pepper to stew slowly in the 
milk until it is tender, which will be in about three- 
quarters of an hour. Keep back two tablespoonfuls of 
the milk and mix this smoothly with the flour, and add 
it slowly to the celery, stirring all the time. Put in the 
butter and let it boil up. Taste to see whether it is 
nicely seasoned; if not, add more salt and pepper. 
Serve with toast cut in three-cornered pieces.

Six or eight even-sized Spanish 

Onions. 
Two ounces of Butter. 



Two ounces of Coker Butter. 
One ounce of Flour. 
Salt and Pepper to taste. 



Peel the onions, taking off the two outside skins, 
scald them, and remove the core, and fill up with the 
flour and butter in the following manner : Mix the 
butter and Coker butter together, with a wooden 
spoon, add the flour, a little at a time, also the pepper ; 
fill the onions with this, and bake for two hours, turning 
them occasionally to prevent burning. 

182. Onions (Boiled). 

Ingredients. 

Six large Spanish Onions. | Two ounces of Butter. 
One ounce of Flour. 

Peel the onions and pour sufficient boiling water over 
them to cover them ; let them stand for ten minutes, 
and then take them out of the hot water, and put them 
into a saucepan with cold water ; let them boil for two 
hours. Drain well, and serve with plain melted butter 
poured over, 

183. Onions Stewed (Brown). 

Ingredients. 



Two pounds of Onions. 
Two ounces of Butter. 
A teaspoonful of Flour. 



Pepper. 

Salt. 

Half a pint of Water. 



If large Spanish onions are used, they should be cut 
in halves, horizontally ; but if the onions are only about 



96 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

double the size of an egg, they may be cooked whole. 
Peel them and put them into cold water, and let them 
boil up quickly and continue boiUng gently for five 
minutes, then drain them. Now put them into a stew- 
pan with the butter and let them stew gently for three 
hours. The onions should be turned once during the 
cooking, and if they are in halves they should be placed 
first on the round end, and finished with the cut side 
down. Great care should be taken in turning them, as 
they should not be broken. If quite small onions are 
used, only about the size of an egg, two hours and a 
half would be sufficient to stew them ; but unless the 
onions are quite tender the dish will be spoiled. When 
they are cooked they must be Ufted carefully and placed 
on a hot dish ; if in halves, the cut side should be at the 
top. They must be kept hot while the sauce is made. 
To make the sauce, pour half a pint of boihng water 
over the browned butter in the stewpan, and let it boil 
over the fire for a few minutes, stirring meanwhile with 
a wooden spoon, to get all the brown from the pan. 
Now mix a teaspoonful of flour with a very httle cold 
water, and then add the contents of the stewpan, 
stirring as it is poured in. Return to the fire and boil 
up ; taste to see whether it is agreeably seasoned ; if not, 
add more salt and pepper. Pour over the onions, and 
serve immediately. The onions should be rich golden 
brown, and the sauce a shade darker. A small spot 
of Parisian Essence may be added to the sauce if it is 
not sufficiently brown. This is a delicious dish if care- 
fully cooked ; but if the butter is allowed to burn instead 
of only browning, the onions will be spoiled.

184. Onions (Stuffed). 

Ingredients. 



Six Spanish Onions. 
Tliree ounces of Bread-crumbs. 
One teaspoonful of chopped 
Parsley. 



Half teaspoonful of mixed Sweet 

Herbs. 
One ounce of Coker Butter. 
Whites of two Eggs. 



Salt and Pepper. 
Peel the onions, scald them, and take out the hearts, 
and fill them with the following mixture. Well mix 
the bread-crumbs, parsley, herbs, salt, pepper, and 
chopped Coker butter together, add the whites of the 
eggs (whipped up.) Fill the onions with this, and 
place them in a saucepan side by side. Pour one pint 
of good brown gravy over them, and stew gently for 
four hours, turning them often so that they may cook 
evenly. When tender, take them out carefully, and 
thicken the gravy they were cooked in with a little 
flour and water; let it boil up again, pour over the 
onions, and serve. 

185. Parsnips (Boiled). 

Well wash and peel the parsnips, throw them into 
cold water, and let them remain for half an hour ; then

98 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

will be in an hour or an hour and a half according to size. 
When they are sufficiently cooked, they should be 
broken open to let out the steam, and this will make 
them Ught and floury. 

187. I'otato Balls (No. i). 

/ Ingredients. 

Two pounds of Potatoes. | Whites of three Eggs. 
Chopped Paisley (if liked). 

The potatoes must be well cooked, though they do as 
well cold as hot for this ; mash them well, and mix 
them with the well-beaten whites of eggs ; form with a 
spoon into balls or rolls, dip in egg and bread-crumbs, 
and fry in boihng Coker butter ; drain well, and serve. 
Mix the chopped parsley in before the egg, if liked. 

188. Potato Balls (No. 2).

Salt. 

Frying Oil, or Coker Butter. 



The potatoes must be boiled according to No. 189 ; 
they wiU then be perfectly dry. Rub them through a 
sieve, and beat in the butter with some pepper until 
they are thoroughly mixed. Beat up the whites of 
eggs sUghtly, and put a quarter of it aside for the 
coating with bread-crumbs ; mix in the rest with the 
potatoes. Now roll the potatoes into balls about as 
large as walnuts ; brush them over with the white of 
egg, and cover them with bread-crumbs, and fry in

pared and allowed to remain there until they are 
wanted. They should be boiled in an iron saucepan, 
and as Uttle water used as will cover them. Let them 
boil up quickly, and then continue to boil very slowly 
for twenty minutes. Now drain them, place a folded 
cloth over them, and let them stand on the stove to 
finish cooking by steaming them. When they are 
quite cooked, which can be ascertained by thrusting a 
fork in them, remove the cloth and shake them from 
time to time while standing on the stove for another 
five minutes ; this will make them floury. If they 
cannot be dished at once, lay the cloth over them again 
while they have to wait. Potatoes should be chosen as 
nearly of one size as possible ; if some are very large 
they should be cut to match the others, or they will 
not be cooked in the same time. 

190. Potatoes and Onions (Braised). 

Ingredients.

248. CasseroUe of Apples. 

Ingredients. 



Two pounds of Apples. 
Quarter of an ounce of Vegetable 
Gelatine. 



One teaspoonful of Essence of 

Ginger. 
Six ounces of Sugar. 



Soak the gelatine in a pint of cold water, add the 
sugar and a teaspoonful of essence of ginger. Put 
it into a stewpan, and let it boil for five minutes, taking 
care it does not burn. Next, put the apples (pared, 
cored, and quartered) into the liquid, to boil until soft, 
but not broken. Take out the apples and place them in 
the casseroUe mould, rinsed out with cold water. 
Strain, and colour the liquid with cochineal and pour it

Six Oranges. I Quarter of an ounce of Vegetable 

Eight ounces of Sugar. | Gelatine.

five minutes, taking care it does not burn. Have 
the oranges ready, peeled and separated into quarters, 
taking out seeds and all white skin, add them to the 
liquid, and allow all to boil for ten minutes. Take out 
the oranges and place them in a mould. Reduce the 
liquid (by boiling) until it is barely enough to fill the 
mould and pour over. Serve cold. 



SWEETS 125 

250. CasseroUe of Prunes. 



Half a pound of Prunes or French Plums. 

Quarter of an ounce of Agar Agar (Vegetable Gelatine]. 

Six ounces of Sugar. 

One pint of Water. 

Well wash and stone the prunes and cut them in 
halves — if bottled French Plums are used washing is 
unnecessary — and soak them in half a pint of the 
water for twelve hours ; soak the agar agar in the other 
half pint of water for the same time. Put the plums, 
and the water in which they have soaked, in a stew- 
pan, and pour off the water that has not been absorbed 
by the agar agar, and add this with the sugar to the 
prunes and stew for one hour. Now strain the syrup 
from the prunes and pour it over the agar agar ; boil 
for a quarter of an hour, stirring occasionally to prevent 
it from sticking to the pan, until it is quite dissolved. 
Put in the prunes, mixing all together carefully, and 
pour into a mould which has been standing in cold 
water. 

If a casserolle form is used it makes a nice dish if 
whipped cream is put in the centre. If French plums 
are used instead of prunes, it is worth the extra trouble 
to blanch the kernels ; removing the stones from the 
plums without breaking the fruit more than necessary 
and putting a blanched kernel in each. The mould 
should stand in a cool place for quite six hours to set, 
and before turning out should be loosened round the 
edges. Agar agar (vegetable gelatine) sets quicker 
than other gelatine.

weigh it in the basin in which it will be mixed, then 
the syrup will not be wasted. Weigh the basin first, 
and then put in the ginger with a proper proportion of 
the syrup. Now cut up the ginger in bits about as 
large as a pea ; add the bread-crumbs to the ginger. 
Make the milk hot, melt the butter in it, and pour it

Pick the gooseberries and put them in a tart-dish ; 
cover them with sugar, and put in the water. Use 
paste (" Paste, Puff, for Tarts, &c.") and bake in a hot 
oven. When the paste is baked, it is better to place 
the tart on the top of the stove to simmer the goose- 
berries until they are quite tender. If the crust is care- 
fully lifted with a knife, a skewer may be inserted to try 
whether the gooseberries are sufficiently cooked, as the 
tart will be spoiled unless they are quite soft.

quickly, and continue boiling for a minute. Now turn 
them carefully in a cullender, and as soon as they are 
cool enough to touch, remove the skins ; they will come 
off quite easily. Make a sjTiip with the sugar and 
water, but do not let it boil after the sugar is melted. 
As each greengage has the skin removed, drop it into 
the syrup. Bring them to boiling-point, but do not 
let them boil ; they must simmer very gently for an 
hour. If they are carefully done, they will be unbroken

boiled for half an hour, pour a teaspoonful on a cold 
plate, and if it sets the jelly is done ; if not, let it boil a 
Uttle longer. Put it in small pots and cover, when 
cold, in the usual way. The flavour is much improved 
by one part of red-currant juice being used to two parts 
of raspberry, but the currants would make the jelly too 
acid for most people on this diet.

NUT DISHES. 



INTRODUCTION 

These are the best and most natural food of man ; 
they are loved by children, who are always hungry for 
them, in marked contrast with their attitude towards 
meat, which they often have to be forced to eat. Yet 
once they have been forced to take it for a time, it 
may, like other stimulant poisons, set up a craving, and 
therefore have to be continued. 

Like all natural foods, nuts are best taken uncooked 
and in their natural state, and those who begin to eat 
them as children prefer them uncooked ; but adults 
who have ruined their circulation, teeth, and digestion 
by years of stimulant poison taking, may be quite un- 
able to do this. Hence the use of very tender nuts at 
first, and often more or less careful cooking, has become 
for them a necessity. 

Nuts are a comparatively concentrated food, being 
for the most part twice as nourishing as bread, and 
with one or two exceptions they are free from starch, 
which is the cause of so much dyspepsia in degenerate 
stimulant takers. They are a food which is already 
fairly cheap, but which, with the expenditure of a little 
care and forethought on production and storage, might 
easily be rendered cheaper still.

Two ounces of castor Sugar. 
White of one Egg. 



Vanilla pod. 

Half a pint of Milk. 

One gill whipped Cream. 



Slit the chestnuts and boil them in water till nearly 
tender ; then drain and shell them, remove the inner 
skin, and cook them till quite done, in the milk, con- 
taining a piece of the vanilla pod. Rub the nuts 
through a wire sieve. Cream the sugar and eggs 
together. Put it to the puree, and mix well over the 
fire. Stir till cool, and place on ice. To serve, pass the 
puree through a coarse sieve on to the dish in which it 
will be sent to table. Mask the surface with whisked 
and sweetened cream, to which a httle vanilla flavour- 
ing has also been added. Decorate it neatly, shaping 
by means of a forcer a pretty pattern on top, and

them into the milk and water — equal parts of each — 
and stew them gently with a little salt for half an hour, 
keeping the saucepan covered. Now drain them, put 
them on a dish and pour the sauce over them. It will 
be best to try the chestnuts when they have been in the 
oven a little more than five minutes, as they should be 
removed as soon as the skin will come away easily. 
More chestnuts should be baked than are really wanted, 
as there are often bad ones amongst them.

bad ones. Remove the skins and drop the chestnuts 
into a saucepan, in which the milk, salt, peppercorns 
and cloves — tied in a bit of muslin — have already been 
heated. Place the saucepan on the stove where the 
milk will keep hot without boiling.

Two ounces of Pine Kernels. 
Two ounces of Almonds. 



Two ounces of Butter. 
One dessertspoonful of dry 
Mustard. 



The beaten white of an Egg. 

Grate the cheese. Blanch the almonds and put 
them through a nut-mill, then pound them well in a 
mortar, adding a drop of white of egg occasionally to 
prevent them oiling — water would serve this purpose, 
but the egg, of course, increases the nourishing value of 
the paste. Well wash and pick over the pine kernels 
and chop them finely. Add the nuts to the cheese and 
also the mustard. Now beat the butter with a knife 
until quite soft — if it is very hard, slightly warm it 
before beating it up. Add it to the other ingredients 
and mix all together very thoroughly. Put the paste 
in a pot and keep it well covered, when it will keep 
good for a fortnight. 

The albumen value is 127 grains to the ounce.

Well cook two potatoes and mash them with the 
butter and cream, and cut into rounds about two 
inches thick, with a tumbler ; cover with white of egg 
and bread-crumbs, and fry in boiUng Coker butter 
until the outside is quite crisp. Take them out, drain 
them, and make a hole in the centre. Remove all the 
soft potato inside, or as much as possible without 
breaking the case. Grind the nuts together through a 
nut-mill, and fill up the potato case with this. If 
preferred, a filUng of grated cheese is very nice, with a 
little chopped parsley on top. The above quantity 
will make six patties, and the value of each if filled 
with nuts or cheese is about eighty-six grains, or the 
equivalent of two and a half ounces of bread. 



409. Pine Kernel and Ginger Cake. 

Ingredients. 



Half a pound of Flour. 
Four ounces of Butter. 
Six ounces of Pine Kernels. 
Six ounces of Golden Syrup.

The grated rind of a Lemon. 
One teaspoonful of Bicarbonate 

of Soda. 
Two teaspoonfuls of ground 

Ginger. 



Sift the flour. Well wash and dry the pine kernels 
and chop them very finely ; then mix them well with 
the flour, grated lemon rind, and the soda. Beat up 



204 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

the butter to a cream — slightly warming it before 
beating if it is hard — and add it also to the flour, &c. 
Now warm the syrup sufficiently to make it run easily 
and pour it over the flour, mixing it very carefully ; 
and when the mixture is quite smooth, beat up the 
whites of egg to a firm froth and add them to the rest 
of the ingredients, beating all well together. 

Turn the mixture into a well-buttered tin about two 
inches deep and bake for an hour in a very moderate 
oven. When the cake has been in the oven ten 
minutes, place a buttered paper over the top to prevent 
it burning. If the cake is intended for people who are 
afraid of becoming too stout, it should be made without 
butter, but it is then, of course, rather dry. 

The albumen value is 62 grains to the ounce.

416. "Apsley" Rusks. 

This form of toasted bread is much more easily 
digested than toast, as it is more completely cooked. 
The bread used in making the rusks must be at least 
three or four days old ; new bread is difficult to cut into 
thin sUces. The oven must be moderate, and the time 
taken in cooking will vary with its heat, averaging 
from twenty minutes to half an hour. Cut the bread 
thinly and place on the oven shelf, or on a slide that 
fits on to the oven shelf and can be taken in and out 
easily. The rusks must be carefully watched and 
turned or they will become brown on one side only ; 
they should be made fresh each day. Use what are 
left over each day for making " Rusk-Crumbs or 
Raspings," 

417. Bannocks. 
Ingredients. 

One pound of fine Oatmeal. | One ounce of Butter. 
Half an ounce of Baking-powder. 

Mix together the oatmeal and baking-powder, rub in 
the butter, and make it into a stiff dough with water. 
Roll out as thin as possible, cut into rounds with a 
tumbler. Butter a frying-pan, and cook a few at a 
time ; when done on one side turn carefully. Serve

Baisins. 

Two ounces of candied Lemon 
Peel. 

Half a teaspoonful of Baking- 
powder. 



Beat the bananas to a pulp with a silver fork, also 
the butter to a cream. Whisk the whites of eggs to a 
froth but not stiff — and mix it well with the butter and 
banana pulp. Now mix the flour, baking-powder, 
sugar, chopped raisins and lemon peel well together 
dry ; the peel must be cut into small thin pieces ; then 
stir them vigorously into the banana pulp, butter and 
whites of eggs. Butter a mould, pour in the mixture 
and bake for one hour and a half.

kitchen stove is a good place. Then put them in a very 
moderately heated oven, and aftei? the iirst tWefity 
fninutes increase the heat until it is hot, but hot so hot 
as is required for pastry. The loaveS must bake fo* one 
hour. Bread is liiuch better baked in tinS ; but if titii 
are not tised, the doiigh must be divided into foilr, afld 
foitaed into rOund cakes and pladed on the open shelves, 
which must be first floured. Three quarters of an houi? 
to rise, and the same time to bake, will then be quite 
long enotigh. Great care should be taken iii weighing 
and rtieasuring the quantities.

Now add the flour, which must be well mixed and 
sifted. Fasten the top on the mixer and turn the 
handle for exactly three minutes ; then put tb£ mixer 
in a warm place, before the fire or on a cool part of the 
stove, and leave the dough to rise for one hour, then 
turn the handle again for three minutes. Remove the 
cover and have ready a well-floured pastry-board. 
Take a large knife and remove the dough from the 
central screw ; divide it into four equal parts, and 
place each part in a weU-greased bread-tin. Let the 
tins stand in a warm place for half an hour so that the 
dough may rise further. The plate rack above an 
ordinary kitchen stove is a good place. Then put the 
tins in a moderately heated oven, and after the first 
twenty minutes increase the heat until it is hot, but 
not so hot as is required for pastry. The loaves must 
bake for one hour. 

They are best turned out of the tin when baked, and 
put to stand on a wire stand to cool. These stands are 
quite inexpensive and are very useful for cooking 
both bread and cakes.

screw ; divide it into four equal parts, and place each 
part in a well-greased bread-tin. Let the tins stand 
in a warm place for half an hour so that the dough may 
rise further ; the plate rack over the stove is a good 
place. Put the tins in a very moderately heated oven, 
and aifter the first twenty minutes increase the heat 
until it is hot, but not so hot as is required for pastry. 
The loaves must bake for an hour and a quarter, but 
the last quarter of an hour the oven must be allowed 
to cool. Turn out when baked and let the loaves cool 
on a wire sieve, or a wire stand.

425. Bread'Raspings (to Prepare). 

All pieces of bread should be put aside in a clean 
bowl, and when enough has been saved to fill a good- 
sized baking-tin, they should be ba,feed i!> a slow oven 
until they are a rich golden tjplpur all thrpugh- They 
should then be rolled on a pastry-board— a small 
quwt^ity at a time-^until they are fljie enough for use, 
and put into a bigcuit'-box with a well-fitting lid, which 
should be k^t in a dry place. These raspings are used 
in msny recipe? for both sweet and savoury dj^hes, and 
a good supply should always be kept in baud. They 
are npt pRly bettiej: and mpre easily digested than 
ordinary bread-crumbs for niany dishes, but tfeey are 
much inpre economical, and are the means pf eveiy 
scrap of br^ad being utilised? As the rolling would 
scratch and dent the board and roUiugrpiu used for 
pastry— and it is necessary to keep them perfectly 
smooth— ra special rolling-pin and board should be kept 
for this purpose. 

426. Bread (Sultana). 

Ingredients. 

Jiqif a pound p{ Sultanas. I Qm H^gs tabjespoonful of c^isioT 
Dough. I Sugar. 

To make a very good sultaua bread take a quartgj

it. The sultana loaf must be bated exactly like the 
other bread. 

427. Croutons. 
Ingreiients. 
Br«ad. I S»Ia,d Oil, or Coker Butter, 

Cut some slices of crumb of bread about half an inch 
thick. If the croutons are required for soup they 
should be cut into dice ; but if for garnishing, they 
may be stamped into any shape, or cut into three- 
cornered pieces. Fry them in hot salad oil, or Coker 
butter, and drain them on an inverted sieve. (See 
"Hints on Cooking.")

batter aside, for at least two hours, or the pancakes will 
not be hght. When it has stood, beat up the whites 
of eggs, rather stiff, and mix them well with the batter. 
A six-inch frying-pan makes the nicest pancakes, and 
for this size half a teacupful of batter will be required, 
and a piece of butter half the size of a walnut. Let the 
butter get just hot, and thoroughly grease the pan 
before putting in the batter. Turn with a broad- 
bladed knife as soon as brown, and brown on the other

side. Roll when done, and sift powdered sugar over 
the pancakts. If whites of eggs are not handy, a tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder instead makes excellent 
pancakes ; but, of course, they are not so nourishing. 

433. Buckwheat Pancakes. 



Four tablespoonfula of Buck- 
wheat Meal. 
Whites of two Eggs. 



Half a pint of Milk. 
Half a te^spoonful of Baking- 
powder. 



Whisk the whites of the eggs for a few minutes, then 
sprinkle in the meal a little at a time, add the milk, and 
beat well for ten minutes ; let it stand for one hour, 
then fry as ordinary pancakes in a small frying-pan that 
has had a well-greased piece of paper rubbed over it, 
Serve very hot, with sjnnip. 

434. Paste (Fried). 

When paste, made according to either of the recipes, 
has been kept two or three days, and is not required 
for tarts, &c., a very nice dish can be made by rolling it 
out three quarters of an inch thick, stamping it into 
sniall rounds, and frying these in either oil or Coker 
butter. The fat must not be quite so hot as for 
general frying. If the cook tries it by throwing in a 
bit of bread, and puts in the paste as soon as the bread 
crisps, and before the fat is hot enough to brown it, 
then the paste will be done perfectly, 

The rounds of pastry should have sugar sifted over 
them, and be piled on a di$b paper. Any stewed fruit 
is nice served with thero.

435, Paste (Puff, for Tarts, 
Tartlets, &c.). 

Ingredients. 

One pound of Flpur, | Half a pgund of Butter. 

A teaspoonf ul of Baking-powder. 

Divide the butter into three portions. Put the flour 
into a bowl, and mix the baking-powder thoroughly 
with it, first, however, taking out three tablespoonfuls 
for working the pastiy. Rub one portion of the butter 
into the flour, and mix it with as little water as will 
make the paste smooth. Roll this out until it is an 
inch thick, then divide in halves. Put one half aside, 
and roll out the other until it is very thin, less than a 
quarter of an inch in thickness. Break up the second 
portion of the butter into small bits, and lay these over 
the paste, leaving a mar^n of quite an inch to allow 
for the butter spreading in rolling. Dredge with flour, 
and fold in three ; then roll out until the paste is an 
inch thick. Treat the other half in exactly the same 
manner, using the third portion of butter. When this 
is done, place the two pieces on the top of one another, 
and roll out until only half an inch thick. Now fold 
the paste and place it between two dishes, and put it 
aside in a cool place until next day. 

When rolling out the paste for tarts, take care to 
keep it one way of the grain. If in using the cuttings 
they are placed straight, one on top of the other, the 
last bit of paste will be as light and flaky as that first 
used. 



220 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

436. PastCy Puff (Old Recipe). 

Ingredients. 

One pound of Flour. | One pound of Butter. 

A teaspoonful of Baking-powdei. 

Take three ounces of the flour from the pound, to 
use for working up the paste, put the remainder in a 
bowl and mix it well with the baking-powder. Divide 
the butter into four portions, and rub one into the 
flour; then mix with as much water as will make a 
perfectly smooth paste. Now roll out the paste to the 
thickness of a shilUng, break up the butter into bits 
the size of a hazel-nut, and place them over the paste. 
Dredge Ughtly with some of the flour taken out for 
working. Be careful to leave a margin of an inch, to 
allow for the butter spreading in the rolling. Fold 
the paste into four, and roll out again to the thickness 
of a shilHng. Repeat these directions exactly, in 
working in the third and fourth parts of the butter. 
When all the butter has been used, fold the paste into 
three, and once again lengthwise, and lay it in a deep 
dish and cover closely. Let it stand in a cool place for 
at least twelve hours. This paste will keep two or 
three days without baking, unless the weather is very 
hot. Be very careful in making up the paste into 
tartlets, tarts, &c., to keep it the way of the grain 
in rolling out, or as the flakes he. The cuttings if 
placed flat, one on the top of the other, and rolled out, 
will then be just as light and flaky as when first rolled 
out. Some cooks spoil quite a quarter of the paste in 
the making of tartlets, &c., by not observing this rule ; 



BREAD, PASTRY, CAKES, &c. 221 

for if the cuttings are gathered up carelessly in the 
hand, and made into a ball, and then rolled out, all the 
work of the cook is spoiled ; for paste so treated will be 
very little better than ordinary short-paste. 

This recipe has been used in the writer's family for 
over a hundred years, and if it is carefully followed, the 
result is excellent. It may seem very troublesome to 
the novice, but after a very little practice it will be 
found that the paste is quickly and easily made, con- 
sidering the result. The only change the writer has 
made in the old recipe is to use a little baking-powder. 
The preceding recipe is founded upon the old one, in 
the method of working the paste, but it is less rich ; it 
is, however, an excellent paste, and if instructions are 
carefully followed, it will be found to be far above the 
average met with in middle-class households.

Ingredients. 

One pound of Flour. I A heaped teaspoonful of Baking- 

Six ounces of Butter. | powder. 

Water. 

Take out two large tablespoonfuls of the flour to work 
up the paste, and mix the rest with the baking-powder. 
When these have been well mixed, rub in the butter 
and stir in as much water as will make a rather stiff 
paste. It is best to mix in the water with the hand, as 
you can then feel immediately when sufficient has been 
added. Flour a pastry-board and roll out the paste to 
half an inch in thickness. Fold the pastry in three, 
and roll out again, when it will be ready for use. Keep 
the board and rolling-pin well floured with the flour

Ingredients. 
One pound two ounces of Flour. | One pound t>t Butter, 

See that the flouf is thofotlghly drjr atid then Sift it. 
Squeeze the butter in a cloth to remove all the moistuf e. 
Now put the butter in ah enamelled stewpafl ahd let it 
stand on the stove until it runs to 6il. It is nedessfity 
to heat the oiled butter so that the scum will rise, but 
care must be taken that it does iiot get tod hot. When 
all the scum has been removed, the Stel^iTfjan should 
be put in a cooler part of the stbve sd that the sedimefit 
may settle to the bottom. Skim off the froth very 
carefully and pour the oil in a basin, leaving the 
sediment at the bottom of the stewpan. Remove 
the sediment from the stewpan and pour back the 
oil — now clarified butter — and sprinkle in the flour 
gradually, stirring all the time. Put the stewpan on 
a slow fire, o* drt a gits-iiSig tiinied low, and stif con- 
tinually With a Wooden spooH. Keep gefgpiilg the 
bottom of the pan to prevent the mixtui'e bUfliing • be

roux. It must itot tuffi more than & eteam eolouf, as 
it is intended to thicken White SdUpS and White Sauces. 
Now retUffi the sattCepait to the fire and cOfitiiiue the

become a bright brown. Be careful that it does not 
get too dark ; a light chocolate colour is the correct 
shade. Immediately the roux iS dark enough, remove 
it from the stove at once, but continue stirring for some 
minutes, as enamelled Stewpans retail! the heat after 
they have been removed from the fire, and the mixture 
would burn if the stirrings was discontinued at once. 
Have ready a large slice of onion and throw it into the 
roiix, if there is any fear that it is getting too dark ; 
this checks the heat at once. This is brown roUx for 
thickening brown soups and gravies. It will keep for 
weeks, and although the process seems rather trouble- 
some, it really in the end saves time. 

In using the roux it is best to scrape off the quantity 
you require with a spoofl, and not add it to the soups 
and sauces in a lump. 

439. Rusk-Crumbs or -Raspings. 

AH the small pieces of rusks, crumbs and broken 
pieces can be utilised fot mSk-crumbs, aiid should be 
kept in a tin. 

The best and quickest way is to put them thtough a 
nut-mill, then through a fine sieve ; keep all the coarse 
ones for decorating and the fifie ones for puddings, 
raspings, &c., and for whatever mentioned in the 
recipes. They are much nicer in many puddings than 
ordinary bread-crumbs.

Ingredients. 



Siloes of brown Biead and 

Butter. 
The Whites of three Eggs. 
A basket of Cress. 



Two ounces of grated Cheese. 
Half a pound of Tomatoes. 
One ounce of Butter. 
Pepper and Salt. 



Hovis bread is best for these sandwiches, because it 
is glutinous. Cut thin slices lengthwise of the loaf and 
butter them nicely, cutting oft all crust. Bake the 
tomatoes and rub them through a sieve. Fry the 
whites of egg in the butter without allowing them to 
brown, and chop them rather finely. Pick the green 
tops off the cress, and throw away the stalks. Have 
ready the grated cheese. 

Now put a sKce of buttered Hovis bread on a flat 
board, spread the tomato puree over it, sprinkle well 
with pepper and salt, and press over it another slice of 
bread ; cover this with the chopped whites of egg, and 
sprinkle with pepper and salt. Cover again with 
another slice of buttered bread, buttering also the 
outside of this before spreading the cress upon it, as 
the cress does not stick well. When the cress has been 
spread evenly over, sprinkle it with salt, and press over 
it another slice of bread and butter, which must also be 
buttered on the top side. Lay over this grated cheese 
sprinkled with pepper and salt, and place another slice 
of bread and butter on the top. Repeat exactly these 
four layers, tomato, whites of egg, cress and grated 
cheese, being careful to press each layer firmly to- 
gether. Now take a clean napkin and wring it out of

cold water ; lift the pile of sandwiches carefully and 
wrap it in the damp cloth. Place another flat board 
on the top of the pile and place a heavy weight on the 
top of it. The sandwiches must then be in a cool 
place for two hours at the least. Remove the weight 
and take the pile of sandwiches out of the cloth, and 
with a sharp knife cut it vertically the thickness the 
sandwiches are required, and they will be striped in 
alternate colours horizontally. The slices should be 
cut again into small squares, piled on a napkin and 
nicely garnished with cress or parsley.

and serve with " salad dressing." (A little cooked 
beetroot may be added if liked.) 



236 THE APSLEY COOKERY BOOK 

463. Cucumber Salad. 

In dressing a cucumber with oil and vinegar, care 
should be taken not to use too much vinegar. The 
proportion of one part vinegar and three parts oil is 
best for digestion, and for people on this diet. French 
vinegar should always be used with oil, as malt vinegar 
in conjunction with oil produces a disagreeable bitter 
taste, for which the oil is often blamed. (See " Hints 
on Cooking.") 

464. Endive Salad. 

Ingredients, 



One head of Endive. 
Half of a small Beetroot. 
A small slice of Onion. 



A dessertspoonful of Salad Oil. 
Three dessertspoonfuls of French 
Vinegar. 



Salt and Pepper. 

Wash the endive and tear it into convenient pieces 
for eating ; it must not be cut. Slice the beetroot very 
thin. Put a very thin slice of onion, about the size of 
a shilling, in the salad bowl, and mince it as fine as 
possible. Now add the endive, which should be well 
dried by tossing it in a clean cloth. Dust in the salt 
and pepper, mixing the salad at the same time ; then 
add the oil and vinegar, and mix very thoroughly. 
Serve immediately.

Wash the lettuce very carefully and put it in a sieve 
to drain. Have ready a clean cloth, and tear up the 
lettuce in convenient pieces for eating {never cut lettuce 
for salad), toss them lightly in the cloth until they are 
dry. Put a thin slice of onion, about the size of a 
shilUng, at the bottom of the salad bowl, mince it as 
finely as possible, and add the lettuce to the onion. 
Dust in some salt and pepper, add two tablespoonfuls 
of oil and a dessertspoonful of vinegar; mix very 
thoroughly, and serve at once. French vinegar must 
always be used with oil. Malt vinegar imparts a very 
disagreeable taste to the salad, for which the oil is often 
blamed.

Old or new potatoes can be used, but new ones are 
best for this salad. Slice them carefully so as not to 
break them. Put a layer at the bottom of a salad 
bowl, sprinkle them with a little of the shallot and 
parsley, which must be mixed together and finely 
minced. Dust a, Uttle salt and pepper over them.

One teaspoonful of dry Mustard. 
Two tablespoonfuls of Cream. 
Juice of quarter of a Lemon. 



Three tablespoonfuls of Salad 

OU. 
A little Pepper and Salt. 



Put the mustard into a basin, add the cream and 
salad oil, a little at a time, until it is used up. Then 



SALADS 289 

add the lemon-juice and beat well. It should be like a 
thin batter. (If well cooked will keep for five days.) 

470. Salad (Mixed). 

Ingredients. 



A small Cos Lettuce. 
The third part of a small 
Cucumber. 



A slice of Onion. 

A few slices of Beetroot. 

Oil and French Vinegar. 



Pepper. Salt. 

Wash the lettuce very carefully and drain it. Have 
a clean cloth ready. Tear the lettuce in convenient 
pieces for eating, and toss it in the cloth to dry. Peel 
and slice the cucumber. Take the slice of onion — 
which must not be larger than a shilling, and very thin 
— put it at the bottom of the salad bowl, and mince it 
very fine. Now arrange the lettuce, cucumber, and 
beetroot in layers. Mix well whilst adding the oil and 
vinegar, dusting in a little salt and pepper from time to 
time as it is being mixed. The proportion of oil to 
vinegar should be one part vinegar and three of oil. 
Salad should not be too wet, and when mixed all the oil 
and vinegar used should adhere to the lettuce, &c., and 
not be in the bowl. Nothing but practice will teach 
the exact quantity of oil and vinegar to use. It is 
impossible to give the exact quantities, as the lettuce 
may vary in size. A salad in which cucumber is used 
will always be more moist than one made of lettuce 
alone.

the pips, and pour it over the sugar and bananas. 
Cover closely, and let the salad stand overnight. Mix 
it carefully, and serve it in a glass bowl. This salad 
should only be taken in warm weather, for the orange 
might disagree with many people in cold weather.

One pound of Tomatoes. 
A slice of Onion. 
A teaspoonf ul of made Mustard. 
Pepper. Salt. 



A dessertspoonful of French 

Vinegar. 
Three tablespoonfuls of Salad 

Oil. 



Choose ripe tomatoes and put them in boiling water 
for a few seconds, when the skin can be removed easily. 
Let them cool and then slice them. Take a slice of 
onion, as large as a shilling, put it in the salad bowl, and 



SALADS 241 

mince it as finely as possible. Place the sliced tomatoes 
over it. Put the mustard in the salad spoon, put in the 
vinegar, stir all together, and pour over the tomatoes. 
Now pour in the oil, and mix very well. This is an 
excellent dish for hot weather. Potatoes in some form 
should always accompany it to table.

cold, taking them from the hot water as quickly as 
possible. Dry them well in a cloth and bake them in a 
moderately hot oven until they are a nice rich brown, 
care being taken that they are not burnt. Pound 
them in a mortar and when well bruised, put them in a 
saucepan with the water and bring them quickly to 
boiling-point, when they must be allowed to simmer 
slowly for half an hour. 

Place a small sieve covered with muslin in a jug and 
pour the decoction through, then stir the treacle into 
it. It will now be ready for use, and when required 
it should be made very hot and taken with boiled milk. 
One-fourth part milk makes a nice drink, but more or 
less can be used according to the taste of the consumer. 

It will keep two days, but deteriorates if kept longer.

nourishing drink. 

503. Toast Water. 

Ingredients. 
Four ounces of Crust of Bread. | One quart of boiling Water. 

Toast the crusts of bread until they are very brown 
without being burnt ; while hot, break them into 
small pieces and put them in a jug. Pour the boiling 
water over them, cover the jug and let it stand on the 
stove, where it will not boil, for a quarter of an hour. 
Strain through a fine sieve, and when it is cold, it will 
be ready for use. The jug in which the toast water is 
kept should be always covered or the flavour will be 
spoilt ; it should be made fresh every day.
