Thi8 little book is a companion to '"What to Cook 
and How to Cook It." For the sake of convenience 
some general rules and proportions are given. A few re- 
ceipts will be found in the first four or five chapters to 
serve as a guide in utilizing the general information 
•under the head of ^''Culinary Crincles.'' 

The receipts for cake decorations and candy are full 
and explicit, made plain enough for the most inex- 
perienced to attempt and succeed \vith.

'Culinary Cxinkleg consist in shaping, cooking to a 
nicety, arranging and garnishing, observing always the 
best way to serve in order to please the eye and invite 
the appetite. Trimming of joints of meaits and chops. 
Croquettes, cutlets and! etc., evenly and uniformly 
shaped. Moulding of loaves of bread, shaping rolls, 
biscuits, sticks, twists and crescents, making them not 
tco large or too small but of uniform size and shape, 
serving on a plate, dish or platter to suit the article 
served, cooking vegetables to retain as far as possible 
their natural shape and color. Congealed dishes mould- 
ed in pretty attractive forms and served with a gar- 
nish that blends well in appearance and taste, and so 
on through th^ whole catalogue of dishes, observing al- 
ways the beauty and attractiveness of the cutting, shap- 
ing, cooking, garnishing and serving. With the use 
of a good cook book giving explicit directions of how 
to prepare food and right proportions that can be ap- 
plied to all food materials, a table of weights and 
measures, a list of garnishes under each chapter, one 
chould be able to find a wide field for artistic work. 

With a little experience, one thing suggests another 
until you no longer depend upon any one particular 
form, shape or garnish but individuality will soon be 
developed and the work become fascinatiing and exhaus- 
tive.

dish. Lettuce shredded, or the heart leaves of the head 
itttuce used to surround, or placed on the dish to suit 
the style of the dish or the shape of the fish. 

Mayonnaise is used to cover or masque the fish, or 
poured around the dish, or made quite stiff and pressed 
through a pastry bag and tube into shapes. 

Aspic is moulded in fancy shapes or chopped. See 
fancy moulding, etc., page 19. 

Ice moulded in oblongs or squares with center re- 
moved with hot iron is an attractive way to serve raw 
oysters. A mound or border of shaved ice is refreshing.

from ■them and used, filled and arranged to surround 
a salad. 

Pickles, olives and capers are all used in garnish- 
ing fish most frequently mixed in a ma3'onnai&e dress- 
ing. 

Cucumbers are cut into slices or made into boats or 
small rounds, cut from them by the use of a very small 
vegetable cutter and miade to resemble peas and when 
the fish is masqued in mayonnaise or a heavy cream 
sauce they are sprinkled over the top. 

Pimentos are used to garnish a mould in which a 
fish is cooked or fitted into small moulds and filled with 
a fish mixture or chopped and mixed with the dressings 
cr cut into fancy shapes and arranged over the fish. 
Potatoes are used in such a variety of ways for so 
many dishes they require a chapter to themselves. See 
page 14. 

Shell Fisli, Lobster, Crah. 

'When oysters are to be served raw the small varieties 
are better and are generally served on the half shell, 
wafers or thin slices of bread and butter and different 
varieties of catsups are served with them and the gar- 
nish is cracked ice, celery and lemon. 

Fried oysters are garnished with lemon and parsley 
and served with tomato catsup or tobasco sauce. Grated 
horseradish and celery are also served with them.

Little neck clams oan be broiled or fried the same as 
oysters. 

Soft Shell Crabs are broiled or fried in the same 
way as oysters and served in their shell or on a folded 
napkin. Lemon and parsley are tho garnishes gen- 
erally used. 

Lobster furnishes its own garnish — the claw and 
coral producing the best effects.

Lean pieces and joints of meats are made attractive 
and more palatable by larding, putting the lardoons in 
rows of fanciful designs. Croutons are used as a sup- 
]>ort for cutlets, chops, croquettes, etc., and are cut 
from loaves of bread — or made into form from rice 
and potatoes and other vegetables. 

Toast points are pieces of hread cut into triangles 
and toasted and used effectively around a dish of fried 
or broiled meats; especially when a sauce or gravy is 
used in combination. Eggs boiled hard, cut into thirds

or quarters. The whites cut into rings or chopped or 
cut intx) petal-shaped pieces; the yolks pressed through 
a ricer and combined witli the whites give a number 
of pretty garnishes. 

Mushrooms are broiled and served with chicken, 
gweet breads, croquettes and other meats, or boiled, 
chopped and served in sauces. 

Spaghetti is cooked in boiling water in long pieces, 
taken from the water, cooled and coiled around the in- 
side of greased moulds and the mould filled with a 
creamed dish, chicken, oysters or veal. It is also an 
accompaniment to meats. Veal cutlets with tomato 
sauce and spaghetti is attractive. 

Macaroni is used in much the same way as spaghetti. 
It can be cut in one-fourth inch pieces and placed in 
a well buttered mould to represent honeycomb, then 
filled with creamed mixture and steamed. 

Peag are boiled, mashed through a sieve, seasoned and 
pressed through a pastry bag and tube. They can also 
be used effectively, left whole and moulded 'with Aspic. 

Beets, carrots and other vegetables can be cut into 
shapes or cut around with a garnishing knife to re- 
semble fluted cups and stuck through with ornamen- 
tal skewers. The greens such, as parsley, watercress, let- 
tuce, etc., always give an attractive appearance to a 
dish. A little green is refreshing and appetizing. 

Lemon sliced and dipped in chopped parsley served 
as a garnish to broile,d steak is pleasing. Gravies and 
sauces should be poured into the dish and the meat

placed in the center. Do not pour them over the meat 
it spoils the appearance of the dish. 

'Paper frills are used around the bone of chops, ham, 
etc., and add very much to their appearance. They 
can be made at home or bought ready for us«. 

Potato eg as a Garnish, 

Irish potatoes can be cooked in a variety of ways, 
boiled, baked or friedi and served with any kind of 
meat. In order to have them dry and mealy they 
should be put into boiling water and cooked in an un- 
covered vessel, taken from the water as soon as tender, 
and thoroughly drained. If they are to be used as 
a puree, they should be pressed through a fine sieve 
or vegetable press. (Seasoned with a little cream, but- 
ter and salt and beaten till very light. In making little 
cups, baskets or forms to be used as a receptacle for 
vegetables, the yolk of egg is added in proportion of one 
egg to a pint of potatoes as they will lose their forir 
when cooked the second time. When pressed through a 
vegetable ricer, they form pretty borders around a dish. 
They are m^ost attractive when pressed through a pastry 
bag and tube which can be done in a great variety of 
way5. Potatoes for frying are cut into straws, balls of 
different sizes, curls and thin slices, dropped in cold 
water until crisp. Dry between towels or take from 
tlie water and expose to the air a short time, fry in 
smoking fat. They are especially acceptable as an ac- 
companiment to broiled meats. 



Cal'e, Candy and Culinary Crinkles. 15 

Bice as a Garnish. 

Eice cooked in a quantity of salted boiling water, 
drained as soon as tender, put in the oven to dry ia 
order to have each grain stand alone and separate, 
makes a beautiful garnish to meats. Mixed with a 
little cream and ^^g rolled into balls and fried, makes 
a good dish in itself and also serves as a garnish. 
Moulded in small rounds, the center removed and the 
cavity filled with creamed yeal or chicken or vegetables 
gives variety and attractiveness. Line a brick mould 
with boiled rice, fill in with creamed meat or macaroni 
and cheese or creamed oysters. Unmould and serve with 
a sauce that blends. Little rice cakes made as rice 
balls and browned in buttex, make a garnish for curried 
chicken and other meats. Eice can be used acceptably 
to garnish many congealed dishes; also for small drop 
cakes. Sprinkle uncooked rice over the tops just be- 
fore putting in the stove and bake until brown. Puffed 
rice is especially good for these little cakes. 

Pastry Bag and Tube. 

Pastry bags are made of both rubber-cloth and can- 
vas. They can be 'bought for twenty to thirty cents each, 
or they can be made at home by cutting the material in 
cornucopia shape and stitching .together, cutting an op- 
ening at the end to fi't the tube you desire to use. Eub- 
ber-cloth bags are better for icings, meringues, whipped 
cream and cold mixtures; the canvas ones for hot mix- 



16 Cal-e, Candy and Culinary CrinJdes. 

iiues, as potatoes, peas^ purees. The tubes are bougbt in 
different sizes and shapes both in tin and brass. Whole 
sets of different sizes and stj^e of openings with a 
rubber bag and a nozzle can be bought which give great 
variety. These are more expensive. Single tubes are 
only ten cents each and two or three are generally 
enough to give variety in size and shape. Pastry bags 
and tubes can be used more frequently and more effec- 
tively than any form of garnish. 

Tinibal Shells or Pontage Cups. 

Make a batter of thre-e-fourths cup of flour, one-half 
teaspoon of salt, add two-thirds cup of sweet milk and 
one egg slightly beaiten, strain, dip a hot tinibal iron 
into the batter and fry the mixture which clings to the 
iron in smoking hot fat, deep enough to cover. Fill with 
peas, m'Ushrooms, oysters, or sweet breads, use as a gar- 
nish around meat or as an entree. 

Pastry Crullers. 

One cup of water, one cup of flour, one &gg slightly 
beaten, one teaspoon salt. Use any shaped cruller iron. 
Dip the hot iron in batter^ then into smoking hot fat 
deep enough to cover and knock from the iron and 
continue this until all the batter is consumed. Use as a 
garnish for broiled chicken, quail or squab. 

Pastry Shells. 

€ut -small rounds from pastr}^ rolled very thin, fit

tliemi over fancy shaped tin moulds and bake. Fill with 
a tart jelly, use as a garnish for fowls. 

Glaze, 

Boil clear sto€k until it is reduced to one-half. If 
necessary add a little gelatine. If veal stock is used 
it is not; necessary to add gelatine but if veal and beef 
are used add one full tablespoon to each quart of stock. 
Glaze is used in brushing over cold meats and for bast- 
ing. It gives a smooth and polished surface to meats. 
It is often added to sauces to give richness and flavor. 
Put in a closed jar and it will keep some time. 



^arnis^es for (Told Mleats* 

t^* f^i ^^ ^^ 

The garnishes for cold meats are almost limitless. 
Aspic is more used than any other garnish as it gives 
such yariety. 

In the hands of an expert the most beautiful designs 
in iiowers, formed by the use of different vegetables, 
eggs^ pickles, olives, capers, etc., can be made. In the 
hands of an inexperienced person, simple and beautiful 
effects can be produced 

QoTiie of the Ways of Using Aspic as a Garnish. 

Mould in flat shallow pans, turn out on a damp cloth, 
cut in squares, diamonds or fanciful shapes by the use 
of different shaped cutters. Chopped aspic makes a 
beautiful border, also aspic moulded in border moulds 
with the meat placed in the center. Moulded in individ. 
ual moulds and before removing from the mould cut out 
the center, leaving space enough to fill with a salad 
or minced creamed meat is also acceptable. 

QuicTc Aspic. 

Soak one-half box of gelatine in one cup of cold water 
for one-half to one hour, if granulated gelatine is used, 

18 



Cal-e, Candy and Culinary CrinUes. 19 

one-half hour is long enough, if s"h.redded, soak one hour. 
Put in a saucepan two cups of cold water or chicken 
liquor, a sprig of parsley, one thin slice of onion, one- 
fourth cup each of chopped celery and carrot, a piece 
of bay leaf, three or four cloves, one teaspoon of heef ex- 
tract dissolved in one cup of hot water. Cook thinty or 
forty minutes. Strain over the gelatine and add the 
luice of one lemon, salt and pepper to taste. When per- 
fectly cold, clarify. The liquor in which a fowl is boiled! 
can be used to make a very satisfactory light colored 
aspic for garnishing salads and cold meats. When there 
is no stock on hand a very saitisfactor}'- quick aspic can 
be made by using beef extract that comes in jars. 

To Clarify Aspic, 

If there is any grease, remove ever}- particle, break 
with two or three strokes -of beater, the whites of two 
eggs (if small use three), break the shells and add two 
quarts of cold jelly. Cook over a hot fire, stirring all the 
while, until it boils. Let it boil four or five minutes, 
stand ten minutes, and strain through a cloth. If not 
perfectly clear, strain the second time. 

To Mould Jelly. 

Fill the mould with ice water and when ready for 
use pour the water out and set in a pan of cracked ice. 
Pour in the jelly, cover over with top, .set in a cool place 
until firm. If some veofetables or other form of garnish 



20 Calr, Candy and Cidinary CrinJdes. 

is 'to be used with it, pour only a small quantinty of jelly 
into the mould and when it begins to stiffen put the fruit, 
vegetables or the garnish to be used on the jelly, and put 
in a small quantity of jelly that is cooled enough not to 
melt the jelly in the mould. 'When this begins to hard- 
en add more garnisih, then jelly, and so on until the 
mould is full. 

If some particular form or design is to be carried out 
in moulding^ the mould should be well coated with jelly 
by pouring in a small quantity turning the mould and 
tipping it from' side to side, until every part of the 
mould has a thin coating of the jelly. 

Place the mould in the pan of ice, so it will set firm 
and level, then proceed with the arramging of garnish, 
by the use of cooked vegetable, cut into shapes. Pickled 
beets, hard boiled eggs, truffler pickles, olives and pars. 
ley. A number of beautiful gamishings can be made, 
by using eggs. Cut the whites in petal shapes; by the 
use of a small skewer, they can be arranged in the 
coated mould to form a daisy, the yellow cut into a 
small round furnishes the center, and parsley, the 
leaves. An attractive border can be made in a round 
mould, a spray or single flower in other shaped moulds. 
Star and diamond shapes are easy and effective^ made 
with peas and beets. In making these it is well after 
coating the mould to dip each, vegetable as it is used 
in jelly, cold enough to ad'here and that fastens itself 
when it is placed in position. After the design is 
formed in this way, add more jelly, a little at a time. 



Calie^ Candy and Culinarij Cnnl-Jes. 21 

v.iili a spoon to keep in shape until the mould is filled. 
If side decorations are to be nsed, th«y are put on after 
the mould is filled. Coat the pieces by dipping in soft- 
ened Jelly and then putting them in place. 

To Unmoiild Jelly, 

Hare a vessel filled with hot water deep enough to 
cover the mould. Immerse the mould, completely cover- 
ing it for a moment; have a soft, dry cloth ready and 
wipe off the mould and catch any water clinging to it. 
Turn the platter in which it is to be served over the 
mould and the jelly will slip out. If it has any liquid 
surrounding, wipe at once with a dry cloth as it will 
cause the jelly to melt if allowed to remain.

(Barnisljes for Salads* 

^ .JS ^ ^ 

Lettuce^ parsley, watercress and celerj^ tops. Rad- 
ishes, beets, turnips, apples, green and red peppers, cu- 
cumbers, pickles, olives, lemons, aspic, eggs all can be 
made into beautiful garnishings. Lemons cut into 
slices and dipped in chopped parsley or cut into basKets 
and filled with a suitable accompaniment. Cucumbers 
can be made into boats or cut with a tiny round cutter, 
the size of a pea, and sprinkled over a fish salad, or 
sliced into round's and laid on a border of cracked ice. 

Pickled beets cut into fancy shapes with cutters cr 
a fluted garnishing knife, made into little fluted cups by 
ecooping out th ecenter, are attractive as a garnish and 
can be used effectively as a receptacle for individual 
ealads. Turnips are used in <the same way. Eed apples, 
green and red peppers are also used for this purpose. 

Scoop out the center of apples with a round vege- 
table cutter and use the balls cut to mix with the salad. 

Green and red peppers should have the stem end cut 
off and the seeds and partitions removed, filled with 
salad and served on lettuce. The little heart leaves of 
lettuce can be arranged with the peppers to resemble 
tulips and little green cups with yellow handles. Ead- 
ishes make an attractive garnish by cutting to represent 
flowers. 

22 



Cal-e, Candy and Culinary CrinMes. 23 

Nasturtiums are one of the simplest and most ef- 
fective of all garnishes and' suitable for almost any 
sala-d. 

Eggs are used in a variety of forms, boiled hard' 
and chopped, and pressed through a vegetable press; 
the whites cut into petal shapes and daisies formed 
from them', the yellows serving as a center. When 
poached or steamed in little fancy moulds, they make 
an attractive garnish. They can be cut into slices of 
different sizes and shapes, also made into little basket 
shapes. 

Curled celery forms a pretty garnish for a number 
of salads and combined with potato balls and other vege- 
tables, very ornamental dishes can be made. 

Aspic can be moulded in small forms or in square, 
deep pans and cut into shapes or moulded in border 
moulds, and the center filled with salad or chopped fine 
and used around a mould of salad. See page 19 for 
moulding and making Aspic.

Nothing is so acceptable and attractive for a garnish 
to congealed dishes, particularly the sweet ones as 
whipped cream. If it is to be sweetened and flavored 
or colored, do it after it is whipped. 

It should be old enough to have body. Set in ice 
water or in a vessel surrounded by ice, and whipped 
with a wire whip, until perfectly stiff; allow to stand 
an hour or two, so if there is any milk, it will settle 
at the bottom. Put the cream into a pastry bag and 
press into shape. It can be made into forms and de- 
signs, flowers, etc., according to the style of the dish, 
upon which it is served the shape of the mould and 
the skill of the one using it. 

Fruits cut into quarters, rounds and pretty shapes 
make an effective garnish for some cold dishes. Flowers 

24 



Cake^ Candy and Culinary CrinJcles. 25 

and leaves are always pretty. Spun sugar is attractive. 
Moulding and shaping of a congealed dish, have as much 
to do with the appearance of the dish, as the ingredients 
used in making have to do with the taste. 

Lace paper mats are for the bottom of plates or plat- 
ters ; pistachino nuts, blanched and chopped are sprink- 
led over. Candied cherries and other candied fruit, cut 
into shapes and arranged in the mould with the jelly, 
are very effective. Indeed it is difficult to limit the 
garnishes and fancy moulding of congealed dishes. 

Use the few suggestions made here and wonderful 
possibilities will be revealed upon entering into the 
work.

Butter and flour cooked together is called a roux 
and form the basis of most sauces ; to this base is added 
the seasoning to suit the dish with which it is to be 
served; if it is to be used with meats, vegetables, spices 
and herbs are added ; for entrees, sauce made from stock, 
white or brown; for vegetables, cream sauce with eggs. 
For fish, the same sauce with lemon juice, vinegar or 
some piquant catsup added. 

Sauces greatly improve the dish they accompany 
and are easily made. 

Brown sauce requires long, slow cooking to blend the 
flavors; if vegetable flavor is desired, chop and fry 
them in the butter to be used in making the sauce; 
if the butter should rise to the top, add a little more 
liquid and stir until it boils when it will become 
smooth. In making roux, the sam.e proportion of butter 
and flour is used. If more butter is required, add in 
small bits at a time, after the other ingredients are 
put in. The simplest sauce made and the one more 
frequently used is the white or cream rumpp..

Yeasi Bread. 

In making yeast bread there are three things to be 
considered, time, quantity, temperature. The temper- 
ature for obtaining the best results is from 75 to 80 
degrees, this hovrever is governed by the quantity of 
yeast used and the time to be used in making. Vrhen 
the bread is made over night or in the morning for the 
evening meal, use a smaller quantity of yeast than 
■when four of five hours are required for making. The 
yeast life is killed at a moist heat of 140 degrees F. 
or a dry heat of 212 degrees F., it will survive freezing 
at 32 degrees F. and placed under favorable conditions 
again will grow and thrive. The receipts given in this 
chapter are to be made in four to six hours, if more 
tim.e is neec^ed use less yeast or let the bread rise in a 
cooler temperature 50 to 60 degrees. Always brush 
over tops of the bread or rolls vvith lard or butter or 
if wanted a glazed appearance, sweet milk mixed with 
the yolk of an ^^^ added, or beat one egg until blended, 
add water and brush over with this; for buns, rusks, 
coffee bread use milk with a little sugar dissolved in 
it, then sprinkle sugar over the top. Coffee bread ia

often served with raisins and nmts added to batter, and 
cinnamon, sugar and butter made into a paste and 
spread over. The top can be made ornamental by 
pressing split almonds and other nuts into the cinna- 
mon paste in some design. 

Quiclc Yeast. 

One cup of boiled Irish potatoes mashed, three- 
fourths cup of sugar, one full tablespoon of salt, one 
cake of yeast and three pints of lukewarm water. Let 
stand in a warm place until it is filled with air bubbles, 
use enough of this liquid to mix the quantity of flour 
you desire to make into bread. This same receipt cati 
be used and a heavy sponge m^ade by using less water. 

Yemt Foam. 

Peel four or five good sized potatoes and boil them 
with three-fourths cup of loose hops tied in a muslin 
bag. Cover them well with water and cook until the 
potatoes are tender. Drain and reserve the water. 
Mash the potatoes and return them to the water and 
mix them well together. Add one tablespoon of flour, 
one-fourth cup of granulated sugar, one full teaspoon 
of salt and cook for a few minutes, add enough flour 
to make a thin batter. TMien lukewarm add one-half 
yeast cake. Mix well and place in a stone jar. Set in 
a warm place for twelve hours. Stir it tv>-o or three 
times during that time. Set in a cool place. Use one 
cup of this to one quart of flour in making bread.

hours for making and baking. Dissolve one and one- 
half yeast cakes in one-third cup of warm water and 
add it to four cups of warm water and one tablespoon 
of salt, warm eight cups flour and add the liquid to 
the flour. If this quantity of flour is not sufficient to

pressing slices well together. Set in a cool place and 
slice as you would .* brick layer cake. Brown and 
white bread can be used alternating the colors and the 
loaf can be made quite ornamental by cutting with a 
tiny round or other shape cutter pieces from the top 
of the loaf and inserting stuffed olives or pimento cut 
into the same shape as cutter, add a bit of parsley 
before the olive is inserted, the olive holding it 
in place gives a pretty effect. Serve on oblong platter 
with a border of shredded lettuce. 

White and Brown Bread SandvAch. 

Cut bread into thin rounds, spread with butter and 
press together alternating colors. Different fillings 
can be used between each slice which gives variety. 

Boiled Sandwich. 

Use bread as fresh as you can cut well, trim off 
crust edge, spread with butter, roll on wet cloth. 
Slender pieces of celery cut an inch or more longer 
than the slice of bread and the ends cut in small strips 
and placed in ice water to curl, wiped dry and rolled 
into bread is pretty and good.

Sandwicli fillings should be chopped or ground and 
mixed with mayonnaise or salad dressings. There are 
some exceptions to this where slices of fruits or meats 
are to be used. The dressing or mayonnaise then is

to suit the taste ; a little chopped celery or lettuce is an 
improvement -to almost any one of them. 

Any cooked meat or a combination of meats, with 
mushrooms added, can be used in this way; chicken, 
veal and sweet breads are especially nice.

Salads* 

Since salads can be used in each day's menu the year 
round, it is desirable to have a variety and this is ob- 
tained by different combinations. A number are given 
with some suggestions which will suggest others. 

Lettuce forma the foundation for nearly all salads. 
It should be washed in cold water to free from dust 
and any insect which is sometimes found. Let it stand 
in ice water until crisp. Shake well and dry in a 
cloth or hang in a wire basket. After crisping it, if 
kept in a cool place it will remain crisp for some- 
time. Celery is prepared in the same way. 

Prepare all articles for salad and keep th^em in a cool 
place and combine wdth the dressings when ready for 
use. 

Salad Dressing No. 1. 

The yolks of six eggs or three whole eggs. One tea^ 
spoon each of sugar, salt and mustard, one-eighth tea- 
spoon of cayenne pepper, one-half cup of cream, one 
tablespoon of butter, one-half cup of vinegar. Beat 
the eggs, add -seasonings, butter and cream, add vinegar 
last. Cook in a double boiler until thick. VvTien cold 
and just before using, fold in one cup of whipped

86 Cal-c, Candy and Culinary CrinUes. 

cream. One-half cup of oil can be added to this dress- 
ing when cold, but if oil is used, leave out the butter. 

Salad Dressing No. 2. 

Mix one-half teaspoon each of salt and mustard, one 
egg slightly beaten, one-fourth cup of cream, juice of one 
lemon. Cook over hot water until it thickens. When 
cold add two tablespoons of oil and one cup of whipped 
cream. 

Salad Dressing No. 3. 

Two cnps of powdered sugar, one cup of oil, six 
tablespoons of lemon juice, one-fourth cup of sherry, 
one-fourth cup of brandy. Mix the sugar and oil to- 
gether, add the lemon juice. Pour the wine and brandy 
over a few lumps of loaf sugar and burn it, then add 
to the dressing. 

Mustard Mayonnmse. 

Two tablespoons of mixed French mustard, two tea- 
spoons of vinegar, one-third cup of oil, one teaspoon 
of Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper and salt to taste. 

Marine Dressing. 

One teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, one table-spoon 
of tomato catsup, one tablespoon of vinegar, three 
tablespoons of oil, salt and cayenne pepper to taste. 



CaJce, Candy and Cnlinarij CrinJdcs. 87 

French Dressing. 

Mix three tablespoons of oil and one-half teaspoon 
of salt and one-half teaspoon of pepper together; stir 
until it becomes a little thickened, then add one table- 
spoon of vinegar and stir until it thickens and assumes 
a whitish color. Tarragon vinegar can be used with the 
wine, or cider vinegar and gives a nice flavor. 

Fruit Salad Dressing. 

Cream two tablespoons of butter, to this, add one 
teaspoon each of salt and sugar, one-half teaspoon each 
of mustard and paprika. Put in double boiler two 
slightly beaten yolks of eggs, add to them very slowly, 
beating constantly four tablespoons of plain or Tarra- 
gon vinegar, and cook until thick. Eemove from fire 
and add butter and seasoning and beat thoroughly. Let 
get perfectly cold and when ready to serve, beat in the 
whip from three-fourths cup of heavy cream. 

Mrs. Rutledge. 

MayQunaise. 

Mix with the yolk of one Qg^ one-half teaspoon of 
salt, a dash of cayenne or paprika, and one-fourth tea- 
spoon of mustard and stir until well blended. Add 
very slowly, one cupful of oil, alternating with three 
tablespoons of lemon juice. Have the bowl in which you 
mix it very cold. Vinegar can be used instead of lemon 
juice or half and half. Som.e prefer the e.gg yolks 



88 Cake, Candy and Cidinary Crinllcs. 

cooked and mashed fine or use two egg yolks, one 
cooked and one uncooked. Made in this way it is less 
apt to curdle. This dressing is made more delicate 
and delicious by enfolding one cup of whipped cream. 
If a colored mayonnaise is wanted, add a little fruit 
coloring <to it. 

Jelly Mayonnojise. 

The proportions are the same as the above receipt 
and made in the same way using one cup of liquid aspic 
for the foundation instead of the yolks of eggs. 

Chicken Salad. 

Chicken to be used for salad should be cooked m 
salted boiling water with a little vinegar added and 
cooked until perfectly tender, ^^^len cold, pull from 
the bones and use the white meat only. The dirk 
meat is good for creamed chicken, timbals, croquettes, 
etc. Cut the meat into cubes, not too small, add one- 
third as much celery, crisped and cut in same size 
pieces as chicken. Season with pepper, salt and a little 
vinegar. Mix with mayonnaise or cooked <alad dres^ 
ing with whipped cream, enfolded; hard boiled oggs, 
i.uts and peppers can all be added to give variety to 
this salad, and it can be served in a variety of ways. A 
Y€iy pretty way is to mould aspic with bits of pimento 
in a border monld. Unmould and fill the center with 
the salad.

Puff paste is used in making vol-au-vents, rissoles, 
and patty sliells. Other pastr}^ dishes can be made 
very ornamental by the use of cutters of fancy 
f hapes ; placing them as borders on rounds of pastry, to 
be used as covers for meat pies. The proportion for 
making puff paste is half as much butter as flour made 
into a rather stiff dough with ice water a little salted. 
The butter is folded in, in a way to enfold air which 
gives lightness to the paste. In making pastry have in- 
gredients cold and m^ake in a cool place, bake in a quick 
oven. 

Puif Paste No. 1. 

Two cups of flour, one cup of butter and one tea- 
gpoon of salt ; use water enough to make a rather stiff 
dough. AVash the butter well and put a rounding 
tablespoonful in the flour. Shape the other in a square 
cake and wrap it in a napkin and put it in a cool 
place. Mix the tablespoon of butter with the flour, with 
the tips of the fingers, working it to a rather stiff 
dough with about one- third of a cup of ice water and 
teaspoon of salt. Knead until smooth. Eoll out an 
oblong piece, twice as long as wide. Put the cake of 
butter in the center, fold the sides and tiien the ends

100 Calve, Candy and Culinary CrinMes. 

of the paste over the butter. Let it stand ten minutes. 
Turn the paste half around. EoU with rolling pin into 
an oblong piece with light, quick strokes. Fold the 
ends to the center and then fold together. Turn and 
roll as before. Let stand a few minutes between each 
rolling. It should be rolled five or six times, then cut 
into shapes, chilled and baked in a hot oven. 

Puff Paste No. 2. 

Four cups of flour, two cups of butter, the juice of 
one small lemon, yolk of one egg^ about one-half cup 
of cold water. Put lemon juice, water and egg together, 
mix one-half cup of butter in with flour, make into 
a rather stiff dough with the liquid', fold in the re- 
maining butter. 

Patty Shells. 

Eoll puff paste one-fourth of an inch thick, cut with 
any desired shaped paitty cutters. The pieces are put 
together, the top one having a small piece cut from 
the center. This piece should be baked separately and 
used as the top after the shells are filled. These shells 
are generally made round, but hearts, diamonds, cres- 
cents and other shapes are sometimes used. They should 
be thoroughly chilled before baking, and should be 
baked on double manilla paper, on baking sheets or 
in shallow baking pans. 



Calce, Candy and Culinary CrinlcUs. 101 

Vol-au-Yents. 

Eoll puff paste one-fourth of an inch thick, cut in 
rounds, the size desired. Put two or more layers. Cut 
out the centers of two top layers (if three layers are 
used). Bake the pieces that come from the centers 
for tops to vol-au-vents ; chill thoroughly aiift oaKO 
sbout thirty-five or forty minutes. Fill the centers 
with mushrooms, sweet>bread3, oysters, creamed chicken 
cr anything desired. Pie pans are generally used to 
cut vol-al-vents. 

Eissoles. 

Eoll puff paste quite thin; wet it about three inches 
from the edge and place upon it little balls of cream- 
ed chicken about three inches apart. Lap over the 
edge of the paste, covering the balls. Press down all 
around, cut with a scalloped cutter into half circles, dip 
in deep fat and fry until a delicate brown. Serve on 
a folded napkin. 

Plain Pie Crust. 

Two cups of flour, one teaspoon of salt, one-half 
to three-fourths cup of lard, and butter mixed, or all 
lard. Mix lard in with the tips of the fingers. Make 
into a stiff dough with ice water. If the dough is tof> 
stiff it will not roll well, will break easily and is dif- 
ficult to handle, if too soft it will be equally hard to 
shape and be tough as too much water will make it 



10^ Cake^ Candy and Culin-ary CrinMes. 

tough. In cold weather use three-fourths cup of short- 
ening, in warm weather use one-half cup. The lard 
can be worked into the dough and the butter spread 
on lightly and rolled and folded in which gives a very 
flaky crust — pastry should be rolled very thin and 
fitted over inverted pans, thus insuring a well baked 
crust. There are some pies that must have the mix- 
tnre cooked with the crust, but when they can be cook- 
ed separately andi combined while hot it is much better. 

Pastry Shells. 

Eoll plain paste very thin, cut into rounds and fit 
over small, plain or fluted moulds. Cut narrow strips 
one-half inch or more wide with a pastry jagger. Wet 
around the edge of pastry rounds with a little cold 
water and place strip around the water holding them 
in place. Bake in a hot oven, remove from moulds 
and fill with creamed mixture, or small rounds can 
be filled into fluted muffin irons and baked, remove 
and fill with a red tart jelly to garnish broiled chicken 
and game. 

Tartlette Paste. 

One cup of flour, two tablespoons of butter, one 
tablespoon of sugar, yolk of one egg. Make into a stiii 
paste with ice water. Fit into shells and cook. Fill with 
fruit sweetened and cooked until tender and thickened 
with arrow root. Cherries, apricots, prunes and peaches, 



Cal'C, Candy and Culinary Crinlcles. 103 

all make nice tarts and with the use of almonds and oth- 
er nuts can be made very ornamental. Any cream or cus- 
tard mixture can also be used in these shells and me- 
ringue pressed through a tube to garnish them. 

Potato Crust for Dumplings and Cobblers. 

Sift together two cups of flour, one teaspoon of salt 
and two level teaspoons of baking powder. Work into 
this with the tips of the fingers, one-half cup of lard 
and one cup of cold, mashed Irish potatoes. Make into 
a rather soft dough with sweet milk. Handle as little 
as possible, roll and cut into rounds for dumplings, fill- 
ing each round with the mixture and press the edges 
well together. Or use for cofobler, fitting into baking 
pan and baking the pastry and fruit separately and then 
combining. 

Meringue for Pies. 

Beat the whites of eggs very stiff, and beat into them 
Tery gradually and slowly two level tablespoons of 
granulated or pulverized sugar to each white of egg. If 
the eggs are 'beaten very stiff at first .and the sugar beatt- 
en in slowly enough you can use your meringue to 
make designs by pressing through a tube. For this it 
should stand alone and be stiff enough to cut with a 
knife. Cook in a slow oven. 

Chocolate Pie 

Stir together one-half cup of sugar, one cup of milk, 



104 Cal-e, Candy and Cidinarij Crinkles. 

one and one-lialf (tablespoons of grated chocolate, the 
beaten yolks of two eggs, one and one-half tablespoons 
of corn starch dissolved in a little cold milk, one-half 
teaspoon of vanilla. Cook over hot water until thick 
and smooth. Cook crust over inverted pan and combine 
with mixture while hot. Cover with whipped cream. 

Rhubarb Pie. 

Stew one pint of rhubarb cut into pieces w^ith one 
cup of sugar and enough water to cover well. When 
it begins to get tender, add two tablespoons of arrow 
root and when it begins to thicken add the yolks of 
two eggs, slightly beaten. Eemove from fire and beat 
well. Cook betwen crusts. All fruit pies are better 
thickened with arrow root. 

Caramel Pie. 

Three cups of light brown sxigar, one cup of butter, 
three eggs beaten separately. Fit paste in pie pan, 
put a piece of paper over and fill with rice or some 
cereal and partially bake. Eemove cereal, brush over 
w4th white of an Qgg, fill with caramel mixture and 
finish baking. 

Caramel Pie, 

Three -^ggs, two cups brown sugar, one-half cup

Ice Cups No. 2. 

Fill the moulds imitating wine glasses or any pretty 
ehape, with water, cover securely, pack in pounded ice 
and a little salt. When the water has frozen sufficiently 
to take the form of the mould, pour out the unfrozen 
water and serve the cups on a small plate with a fancy 
mat or doily; fill stacked up high with a frozen sher- 
bet, plain or fruit. Each cup can be made a different 
color, and is a very attractive way of serving ices. 

Marshmallow Baskets, 

Use receipt for marshmallows on page 213. Oil 
seme small round or oblong moulds, dust over lightly 
Avith corn starch and fill with marshmallow mixture be- 
fore it becomes too stiff to pour. Let stand until stiff. 
It will take several hours. Cut out the center leaving 
one-third of an inch margin in which to place a handle. 
Eemove from the moulds, insert handles made of wire, 
wrapped with very narrow ribbon, whit© or colored, 
and finished with a tiny bow at the end's. Decorate the 
ddeg and edge by the use of pastry tube and bag and 
in any design that suit? the fancy. Fill with charlotte

msse, sweetened and flavored whipped creaim or a frozen 
dessert. Xougatine cream is especially good with this — 
see page 127. 

If the moulds used are very small, the baskets can 
be filled with candies or nuts and served as bon-bons. 
If larger moulds are used they are served as recepta- 
cles for ices, creams, etc. 

Cal-e Bounds for Serving Ices. 

Cook plain white cake in sheets about one or one and 
one-half inches thick. Cut in rounds about four inches 
across. Cut out centers, ice with white or caramel ic- 
ing, decorate through a tube. Fill centers with cream, 
sherbert or charlotte rus.se. Serve on lace paper mat^. 

Cal'B Basil ets. 

Use the rounds as above and insert covered wires or 
cover the wire with baby ribbon and then insert. Or 
bake orange cake and plain white cake in small moulds, 
cut out the center, invert and ice w^ith golden filling or 
any colored icing. Insert wire for handles. Decorat3 
with icing pressed through a tube, fill with cream, sher- 
bet or charlotte. Beautiful baskets can be m.ade from 
cake baked in pans two and one-half inches deep and 
cuft in shapes, oblongs or rounds or squares. Cut out 
centers, ice over. Use small round tube and lattice the 
sides with any colored icing. Insert handles and dec- 
orate with tube.

Candy Baskets No. 3. 

Use the above recipe. Pour on oiled slab and when 
it is cool enough to handle at all pull until it is very 
light. Pull off small pieces and stretch over moulds or 
glasses. These are beautiful and look like satin and 
are called satin baskets. If different colors are wanted 
add coloring after it is poured out and then pull it in. 

Almond Paste for Lhiing Moulds. 

Put in stewpan one-half pound of lump sugar, one- 
half pound of ground almonds, three tablespoons of

Jelly Cups, 

Make a fruit or wine jelly and mould in round cups 
two and one-half or three inches deep, cut out the 
center using a grape fruit knife. Unmould and fill 
with ice cream or frozen pudding. Lemon or wine 
jelly with a little gold or silver leaf added when it be- 
gins to stiffen, make a very beautiful and brilliant 
jelly cup, the leaf comes in small sheets and while ex- 
pensive, requires a very small quantity in making the 
jelly; it is put in tiny little bits, scattered through the 
jelly. Gold leaf or snowflake jelly can be moulded in 
square pans one and one-half to two inches deep. Un- 
mould on a wet cloth, cut in small squares or rounds, 
cut out the center; for gold leaf rounds use any kind 
of ice in center and chop the pieces taken from the 
center very fine and sprinkle over top of cream; snow- 
flake jelly rounds are attractive. Pip from the f:'eezer 
by the use of round dipper made for the purpose, 
balls of cream, drop them in a bowl of grated cocoanut, 
place in the center of rounds.

The chapter on how to mix and bake cake is so ex- 
plicit in '"What to Cook and How to Cook It/' it is un- 
necessary in this volume to do more than give the 
things to be remembered with some general directions. 
The proportions and way of mixing are given in the fol- 
lowing receipts, the change in mixing now and th-en 
come from the change in the proportions. 

Things to he remembered in mixing and hahing cake. 

Always sift the flour and sugar before measuring. 
Use light colored butter^ rich yellow butter does not make 
good cake, it is too oily. If yellow butter must be used, 
bleach by washing well with cold water, in summer 
use ice water. Pour off wat^er and add lemon juice. 

For delicate cake where butter is used, line the bot- 
toms of the pans with oiled paper, or manilla paper 
brushed over with lard. For muffin or little mould 
cakes, grease the pans and dust lightly wi^h flour. Bake 
with an increasing heat; avoid having the oven hot at 
first. 

When cake rises too high in the middle too much 
flour has been used ; when it cracks, too much heat. 

137 



138 Cake, Canchj and Cnlvnary CrhiTcIes. 

Use a round bottom porcelain bowl and woodea 
slotted spoon for mixing. 

In very cold weather warm the bowl in which you 
mix the cake, also the flour and sugar. Use a good 
quality of fine granulated sugar and winter wheat 
flour is preferable. 

In putting batter in pans allow from one-half to 
three inches for rising. Allow space according to the 
size of cake and shape of pans. 

Layer cakes are cooked from twenty to thrit}'-five 
minutes, according to the thickness of the layers. 
Mould cakes from forty minutes to two hours. 

Do not remove mould cakes from pan until cold. 

In mixing fruit cake, prepare the browned flour, 
nuts .and fruit before beginning to make the cake. See 
"What to Cook and How to Cook It." Page 159. 

Xever stir or beat sponge or angel food cake batter. 

If your oven cooks too quickly for cakes and pud- 
dings wrap grea.sed paper around the moulds or pans. 

In making chocolate glaze melt the chocolate and 
add to glaze when cool, it will cloude if added while 
hot. 

In cutting small cakes from .sheet, dip your knife 
in warm water first and in cutting rounds or crescenits 
ice or glaze over before cutting. 

How to Mix and Bake Fruit Cake. 

■Cream the butter, add sugar, then the lightly beaten 
yolks of QggS:, sift the spices, raising material and flour

together and add next, unless molasses is used; in that 
case, the molasses first, then the flour, etc. Bea# 
the whites of eggs very stiff and stir in, add the nuts 
and fruit last. If brandy or wine is used, add just 
before the fruits and nuts are stirred in. 

Put the batter or mixture into a pan or mould, 
large enough to allow two or three inches for the rising. 
Set this into a pan deep enough to hold several inches 
of water; have the water hot and put in a rather slow 
oven. Cover over the top of cake mould with tin top. 
Set a pan of hot water on upper grate. Cook in this 
way until the cake has risen to the top of pan; re- 
move the top and continue the cooking until the cake 
is done but not browned. Take pan of water from 
upper grate and cook until the cake browns. 

Cakeg can be cooked without the hot water, but are 
much more moist and tender cooked in this way. Leave 
in the pan until perfectly cold. Eun a spatula around 
the sides of pan and then invert the pan and the cake 
will slip out. Cook from three to four hours accord- 
ing to size of cake and the quantity of fruit used. 

How to Mix and Bal'e Angel Food and Sponge Calce. 

Beat the whites of eggs until light, add cream of 
tartar and continue the beating until the eggs are very 
stiff. Beat in the sugar lightly, add the flavoring and 
fold in the flour as lightly as possible. aSTever stir or 
beat the batter, it breaks the enfolded air and the bat- 
ter falls and the cake will be touorh. Bake in unorreas- 



140 Cal'e, Candy and, Culinary Crinlile^. 

ed pans in a. moderate oven and witli an increasing heat. 
If nuts or fruits are used^ add with the sugar. 

Sponge cake is mixed and baked very much in t"^-" 
game way as angel food^ generally adding the sugar to 
the yolks of eggs and beating together until light ;, the 
flour is folded in last, then the stiffly beaten whites 
(add rising material, with flour if any is used) ; the 
flavoring is added with yolks and sugar. There are 
some variations in mixing sponge cake, but these are 
the general rules.

powder in the last cup of flour. Beat the whites very 
etifl, add sugar gradually. Combine the two mixtures, 
adding a little at a time. Bake in a mould or in layer 
cake pans. This is a delicious, fine grained cake and is 
especially good for baking in large sheets to cut into 
small cakes. Have a pan made twelve by fourteen inches 
and one and three-foorths inches deep; line the pan with 
greased paper and cook forty to fifty minutes in a slow 
oven at first, then increase the heat. Turn out at once 
when done on a folded cloth, let stand until cold. Trim

Directions for Making. 

The proportions of sugar and egg differ according 
to (the kind of icing you desire, a soft creamy one 
or one that hardens quickly. The way the syrup is 
poured on the egg — the degree to which it is cooked 
and the way the e.ggs are beaten, all have to do with the 
quality of icing. Some icings require the eggs to 
be beaten very stiff, others only until light and some 
not at all. 

The sugar is generally cooked to the soft ball or 
thread stage. When it spins a hair from the point 
of a spoon, or can be rolled between the fingers to 
form a soft ball, it is ready to pour over the eggs. 

The best quality of cane sugar should be used, as 
much of the success of the icing depends upon the 
ouality of sugar. 

The syrup should be poured on the eggs very slowly 
in a very fine stream; it then cooks the eggs with a 
small degree of heat and the icing ig made creamy. 
When the syrup is poured on rapidly the eggs ar^"* 
cooked too quickly and the icing becomes hard and 
sometimes grainy, and often falls from the cake in 

165 



166 Cake, Cmidy and Cnlinary Crinlles. 

flakes. If the syrup should cook a d€*gree or two too 
much, add! a spoonful of hot water to it before pour- 
ing over the eggs. A drop or two of lemon juice, a 
pinch of creami of tartar added to the egg will cut 
the grain of sugar and render the icing creamy. 

If after beating the icing until cold it does not 
cream, put it over (not in) a vessel of boiling water 
and cook a few minutes beating all the while. When 
it is heated through, remove from the fire and beat 
until cool, when it will cream. 

Directions for Icing Cake. 

If you are icing a white cake, trim off the crust be- 
fore spreading the icing. If the crust should be hard 
cover cake over with a damp cloth which will soften 
the crust when it can be trimmed easily. A layer 
cake should be cut into shape before the icing is 
spread. Use a spatula for spreading. Pile the icing 
thick enough in center of cake to cover top and sides. 
If in icing a la^'er cake the icing should not be quite 
firm enough to hold the layers together well, stick a 
skewer in the center. This will prevent them from 
slipping, when the icing is set it can be removed. 

Dvrections for Cutting, Dipping and Icing Small or 
Individual Cakes. 

Individual cakes are made from plain cake, either 
white, yellow, fruit or nut cake mixtures couked in 



C(d-(\ Candy and Culinary Crinldcs. 167 

square pans from three-fourths to one and one-fourth 
inches deep. When cold trim off the crust and cut into 
any desired shape. Diamonds, triangles and squares 
can be cut, using a sharp knife without any waste of 
cake. Round and fancy cutters are used to give va- 
riety. There is some waste, but the scraps can be 
utilized in making custards and puddings. Little 
cakes can also be cooked in moulds bought for the 
purpose in a variety of shapes, if these are used the 
crust is not trimmed off. Small cakes can be either 
dipped in fondant or icings by the use of a skewer, or 
icing can be spread on with a spatula. Dipping is 
much easier and more satisfactory. 

In ornamenting small cakes, simple decorations can 
he made by the use of candied fruits, nuts, cherries 
and pineapple chopped fine and sprinkled over them. 
Pistachio nuts, chopped almond's blanched and split 
and put on to represent daisies with a hit of raisin in 
the center; little candies and angelique can be used to 
give variety. Cocoanut grated can also be used to make 
snow balls, but the greatest variety and most artistic re- 
sults are ohtained by the use of pastry bags and tubes. 
I'he bags are made of rubber cloth, which can be 
bought for sixty or seventy-five cents per yard. One- 
third of a yard will make three or four bags. The 
tubes of tin or brass can be bought in any shape or 
size. Sets of twelve tubes, one nozzle and one bag 
costs one dollar and a half and are used with great 
convenience as different tubes can be used with only one 



168 Cal-e, Candy and Cidlnary Crinl-lcs. 

bag by unsorewing one tube from the nozzle and insert- 
ing another. Conventional designs, flowers, fruits and 
figures can all be made by the use of the itubes and dec- 
orative icing. The leaf, round and rose tubes; are the 
most used as they make the largest variety of flowers. 
'The leaf tube is used for making ro&es, violets, lilies, 
sweetpeas and daisies. The star-shape makes carna- 
tions, chrysanthemums and etheT flowers; the plain, 
round tube is used for stems O'f flowers, side decorations, 
forget-me-nots, lily of the valley and bow knots. 

Tubes Made from Paper, 

Get a good quality of bond paper, size eight by ten 
and fold into cornucopia shape, pin together near the 
point and cut the point 'to suit the kind of flower or 
design to be made. By cutting a piece from the end 
of tube the shape of the letter V, the leaf tube is formed 
from which so many flowers are made. Increasing or de- 
creasing the- size of the cut both in length and breadtth, 
the size and shape of the flower petals ca.n be secured. 
Two small cuts, the same shape side by side, give the 
star tube from which chrysanthemums and carnations 
are made. The stem tube is made by simply cutting 
a bit from the end of the tube, the amount cut, 'depend- 
ing upon the size of opening desired. 

Flower Decorations, 

Use decorative icing No. 1 or 2. 
Cii.t cake into shapes and fasten them to small 



Calc, Candy and Culinary CrinMes. 169 

pieces of cardboardi by the use of a little icing. Spread 
them over smoothly and evenly with the icing, use 
a tube with small round opening and make the side 
decoration which can be done in white or colors and 
in almost any design. I>i*aw some simple pattern on 
a piece of paper and copy them on the cake, embroid- 
ery patterns can be copied or used as a guide. Divid* 
the icing into as many portions as colors to be used and 
mix the color paste in a small portion of the icing and 
then lightly fold this into the full portion. Put ithe 
mixtures in small plates or porcelain or china bowls, 
cover over with oiled paper as a crust will form over 
them if exposed to the air. Have all the colors and 
tubes ready before beginning the work; fill with icing, 
folding the top of tube in a way to prevent the icing 
from coming out of the tube. The tube con- 
taining the green icing is first used to form the stems 
of flowers, then take the tube with the flower-cut end 
and hold the point so it will barely touch the cake 
and press gently, not moving the tube until you have 
pressed out the size of the petal you desire. Stop 
the pressing as soon as the petal is formed and lift 
the tube, continue to make the petal? of flowers in thi? 
way, arranging them in proper places to form the 
ghape of the fl^ower; leaves and bow-knot are put on 
last. 

Forms of some flowers and fruits are made by adding 
X X X X sugar to a portion of the icing until it is firm 
and working it until it is as pliable as putty; 



170 Cake, Candy and Culinary CrlnUes. 

(c]or to suit the flower. Take a small portion in the 
hands and shape. Morning glories, jonquils and fruits 
are niad€ -in ithis way; with a little practice they can 
be made so natural one can scarcely believe them to be 
artificial. 

Eow to Dip Cake in Fonda/nt 

The receipt for fondant with directions for making 
is on page 193. 

Put a small quantity in a double boiler and melt 
over hot water, stirring all the while. Stick a small 
skewer in the cake and dip into the fondant. Keep the 
fondant over hot water, all during the dipping and if 
it becomes too stiff thin with a small quantity of 
&yrup made by cooking one cup of sugar and one-half 
cur) of water together fifteen minutes. 

In flavoring fondant use only a few drops at a time 
a? it takes very little liquid to dilute it and it may 
become too thin. In this case add a little more fond- 
ant. It can be colored and flavored \^ith different fruit 
colorings and flavorings and give great variety. 

Plain White Icing No, 1. 

One and one-half cups of sugar, two-thirds cup of 
water, whites of two eggs. Put the sngar and water 
on and cook until it hairs. Pour in a fine stream very 
slowly on to the stiffly beaten whites of eggs. If your 
syrup is not sufficiently done put icing over, not in 



Calce, Candy and Culinary Crinkles. 171 

hot water and continue to beat and cook until it 
creams. If your syrup is cooked too much, add a little 
hot water to it before pouring on the egg. A drop 
or two of lemon juice or a pinch of cream of tartar 
will remedy it also. 

Plain Whiie Icing No. 2. 

One cup of sugar, one-half cup of water, white of one 
egg, beat the egg until light, not stiff, cook sugar and 
water until it hairs, pour on to egg very slowly, beating 
all the while. 

Plain White Icing No. 3. 

One cup of sugar, one-half cup of water. Cook to- 
gether until it hairs, pour over the unbeaten white of one 
egg. Beat until creamy. This is a good receipt for 
icing individual cakes. Put a cake on a flat paddle, 
pour a spoon of icing on and use a spatula to spread. 
The icing dries quickly and makes a gloss while the 
inside keeps creamy and soft. 

Decorative Icing No. 1. 

One cup of sugar, one-half cup of water. Cook un- 
til it hairs. Pour over the white of one egg, beaten 
about half, pouring in a small fine stream. Beat un- 
til it begins to cool then add one teasipoon of lemon 



172 Cake, Candy and Culinary CrinTcIes. 

juice and continue to beat. It shouldi be very white 
and creamy and stand perfectly stiff. If it should not 
do this after adding the lemon juice, add a pinch of 
tartaric acid. 

Decorative Icing No. 2. 

One cup of sugar, one-half cup of water. Cook un- 
til it drops heavy from tlie spoon. Pour slowly over 
tlie whites of two €'ggs, beaten very stiff. Put this 
over hot water and when the wat^r begins to boil, add 
one teaspoon of lemon juice or a pinch of tartaric 
acid. Continue to beat and cook until the icing stands 
alone and tastes creamy. Remove from the fire and 
fold in the flavoring and continue the folding until 
the icing begins to cool. This is a beautiful and de- 
licious icing and if kept covered with oiled paper will 
keep in a creamy state for an indefinite time. It can 
be miacle in large quantities and kept on hands; do not 
beat it after it is done, but fold over and over until cool. 

Decorative Icing No. 3. 

Beat the white of one egg until stiff. Beat into it 
slowly, enough pulverized sugar to make stiff enough 
to stand in points from a spoon. Add a teaspoon of 
Jemon juic-e, alternating it with the sugar. 

Decoraiive Idng No. 4. 

TJ«e the same ingredients and proportions as No. 3. 



Cal-p^ Candy and Culinary Crinlclcs. 173 

Add the sugar gradually, alternating with lemon juice, 
to the unbeaten white of egg. Nos. 3 and 4 icings 
are used for decorating mints, candy baskets, bonbons, 
and so forth. 

Decorative Icing No. 5. 

Adldl one-fourth teaspoon of citric acid 'to the whites 
of threes eggs and beat until stiff. Cook three cups of 
sugar and one and one-half cups of water together un- 
til it hairs; pour very slowly in a fine stream over the 
beaten whites of eggs beating all fthe while, continue to 
beat until it is cool and stands alone. 

Cocoanut Icing, 

Use plain white icing, 'stir freshly grated' co'coanut in. 
Sprinkle over the tops and sides while the icing is 
moist andi the cocoanut adheres well without any 
trouble. 

MarslimaUow Icing Xo. 1. 

Put one pound of marshmallows and one-half cup 
of water in a double boiler and stir until melted. Add 
one-third cup or more of orange juice and one-half 
oup of chopped fruits and nuts. Eemove from the fire 
and beat until co-ld. Spread between cakes and ice over 
the top with plain white icing. 

Marshmdllon} Icing No. 2. 

Use white icing, and just before spreading it on 
the cake, melt one-fourth of a pound of marshmallows 



174 Cal^e, Candy and Culinary Crinfcles. 

by putting three tablespoons of hot water over them 
and set in vessel off hot water, beat nntil cold. Pour the 
melted marshmallow into the icing, spread between 
and over the tops and sides of cake, and ornament 
the top wiith marshmallows cut in halves and quarters. 

Marslinmllow Filling, 

iSoak one level tablespoon of granulated gelatine in 
one-fourth cup of cold water twenty minutes, dissolve 
in one-fourth cup of boiling water, beat the whites of 
three eggs stiff and beat into them the dissolved gela- 
tine, pouring it in gradually, beat in three-fourths cup 
of pulverized sugar, flavor with any desired extract 
or liquor; color or not to suit the taste, fruits and 
nuts can be added if desired. "When, nearly stiff ^ pour 
in shallow pans the size of cake on which it is to be 
U'sed, unmould and stack with cake, alternating eake 
and filling. 

MwrshmaUmv and Caramel Filling. 

Four cups of white sugar, and one cup of cream. Put 
three cups of sugar and one cup of cream on to cook 
in a vessel and at the siame time melt in a hot skillet 
the remaining cup of sugar; as soon ag melted pour 
into the cream and sugar, cook for two or three min- 
utes. Eemove from the fire and beat until it begins

In makix,^' candy the most important thing is to 
know just when it is cooked to the proper stage. This 
can he clone to the exaot degree by the use of a su- 
gar thermometer. There are a number of terms used 
by confectioners to express ithe degree of cooking such 
as small and large thread, the blow, the feather, and so 
forth, but only three degrees are necessar}' in making all 
candies. 

Soft ball 236-238; hard ball 246-248; crack 290-310. 

Caramel is when it has cooked until it is quite brown 
and recfisters 345-350. A little experience with the 
use of the thermometer will enable one to determine 
to the exact degree the candy is to be cooked. Set the 
thermom.eter into the boiling candy and after it begins 
to boil in thick bubbles, watch it closely and when it 
has reached the proper degree, remove the candy at 
once and put the thermometer in hot water — wash well 
and hang ready for the next using. 

Useful Tools for Making C(mdy. 

A granite or porcelain kettle or saucepan is the best 
utensil for cooking candy unless a small copper kettle 

187 



ISS Cale, Candy and CuJinanj Crinklrs. 

can be found, but they are seldom made in small sizes. 

A wooden spoon is best (to stir the candy with as 
the handle does not get hot when left in the boiling 
sj^rup. 

A thermometer is useful but not necessary, it gives 
the exact degree of cooking and takes away the un- 
certainity of knowing jusit when it is cooked enough. 

A ma.rble slab for cooling, cools quickly, is smooth 
and easily cleaned and wdiile not necessary is very de- 
sirable. 

A fondant kneader which is a broad piece of metal 
much like a wall paper scraper, has a wooden handle 
and facilitates the work. A wooden paddle is a good 
substitute. A double boiler fo'r melting fondant and 
chocolate and for dipping bonbons is ne•cessar}^ 

A funnel shaped 'tin utensil with small opening at 
end with a round 'wooden stick to fit the opening is a 
great convenience for dropping fondant in shapes in 
starch boxes and for shaping mints, and are called fon- 
dant droppers. 

An iron hook screwed into the wall at a convenient 
distance for pulling candy . and a pair of buckskin 
gloves facilitates the pulling and preserves the hands, 
especially when candy is cooked to a very high degree. 

Iron bars three-fourths of an inch square and eigh- 
teen or twenty inches long, placed on a marble slab 
for confining caramels is a great help, but square tin 
or granite pans are used successfully. 

Lipping wire is a small 'tool for dipping bonbons, 



Cal-e, Candij and Culinary Crinld'es. 189 

fruits^ and so forth, in fondant and can be boiiglit at 
confectioners supply lioiises and is a necessary article. 

A small pair of scales for weighing sugar and 
glucose. 

A sharp, strong pair of scissors for cutting pulled 
candy and a heavy strong sharp knife for cutting cara- 
mels. 

Waxed paper is very convenient and for some can- 
dies necessary; keep a supply on hand as it is useful 
in other cooking. Oiled paper for wrapping caramels 
and other candies can be bought, cut ready for wrap- 
ping or bought in sheets and folded and cut to suit 
the size of candy. 

Important Things to Ernow and Be member in Making 
Candy. 

In pulling candy where glcveg are used, grease them 
lightly at first and duet with flour or corn starch, if 
gloves are not used, dip the hands now and then in 
cold water. 

Always grease the slab or dish for fondant or pulled 
candies and oil is much better than butter, sprinkle 
fondant over with a little water which makes it less 
liable to grain. 

White oil cloth stretched tight over a thin board, 
which can be moved easily is a nice arrangement for 
placing candies dipped in chocolate. 

Xuts to be cracked can much more easily be re- 
moved from the shell without breakinor if the^* are 



190 Cake, Candy and Culinanj Crinkles. 

soaked first in cold water for several hours. Crack 
pecans on the side that doeis not have the vein. When 
nuts are to be broken and not chopped fine, use 
a large knife, put nuts on a table or flat surface, 
rest the point of the knife on table and with left 
hand raise the handle up and down with the right, 
chopping a few at a time. Wooden bowls with chop- 
per is beat where nuts are wanted to be chopped very 
fine. 

In cooking candy with cream or milk, have the kettle 
large enough to allow for boiling up. 

When receipts call for weights and no scales aT9 
convenient, remember two cups of sugar is one pound 
and two cups of glucose is one and one-half pounds. 
The proportion of water for sugar is about three- 
fourths of a cup of water to two cups of sugar. 

In dipping chocolate use plenty of chocolate and 
have it almost cool before dipping. 

In making candy where cream is used, heat quickly 
.as long slow cooking is apt to make the candy curdle. 

Always istir candy until the sugar is dissolved. 

If fondant should grain it can have a little water ad- 
ded and cooked over, but is never as nice. It is better 
to use it for a foundation in making other candies. 

Sta/rch Boxes. 

Starch boxes can be made of wood, tin or granite, 
and in any size. Granite pans t^^elve or fourteen 
inches square and one to one and one-half inches 



Cal'C, Candy and Culinary CrinUes. 191 

deep make good boxes. Sift them full of corn starch. 
and smooth lightly over the top. Moulds of different 
shapes and sizes can be made or bought, and when 
iglued to a narrow thin strip of wood or paste board 
an inch or more apart, heavy indentations can easily 
be made by pressing the moulds lightly iruto the starch. 
Have the strip a little longer than the box so the 
ends will extend beyond either side; fill the box with 
indentations. Melt the fondant, put it into the dipper 
having a small round stick to aid in dropping the 
fondant into the moulds and to prevent the fondant 
running too fast. 

^loulds can easily be made by cutting potatoes, car- 
rots or turnips into the shapes desired and pressing 
them into the starch, remove and fill with plaster of 
Paris mixed t^vith water to a stiff paste. "WTien these 
harden they can be removed and glued to (the strips 
of wood and used when needed. 

Chocolate Coating. 

Use chocolate made for this purpose. It comes in 
the bitter and sweet. In order to have the 
chocolate glossy and keep its gloss, there must be 
plent}' chocolate to work with. Put a pound in a 
double boiler and melt with as little heat as possible. 
Stir all the time until melted. Do not allow any 
water to boil into it as it makes the chocolate dull. 
Pour on a platter or marble slab and work with tlie 
hands, until it begins to cool. Drop the center into 



192 Cal-e, Candy and Culinanj CrinUcs, 

the chocolate. Coat it well by turning it over and over. 
Take up between the (thumb a^d finger and rub oi! 
any surplus chocolate there is, or in other words, make 
them smooth and evenly coated. Place on an oiled 
slab or boards covered with oil cloth. Stretch and tack 
the oil cloth on well. Place the drops on and 
set in a cool place to harden. The chocolate ithat 
hardens on the platter and becomes too stiff to use 
forms a foundation on which to pour more chocolate 
and when the coating is all done, take all of the cho- 
colate left, return to <the double boiler and save for 
the next coating. There is no waste whatever to it, 
but economy in using a large quantity as the work 
can be done so m.uch more easily and quickly. 

Directions for Mahing Candy. 

In receipt where the sugar is to be mixed with wa- 
ter use cold water. Put over a hot 5.re and stir con- 
stantly until the sugar is dissolved. 

Wash the grains from the sides of the kettle witli a 
gmall brush, dipped in water, cover over until it be- 
gins to boil, as the steam encased will help dissolve 
the sugar that clings to the sides of kettle. Take off 
the top and cook rapidly. Candy is less liable to grain 
if cooked quickly. This applies to all candies, but 
especially when water only is used in mixing In mak- 
ing caramels or candies where butter, milk, cream or 
molasses are used the cooking cannot be done quite so 
rapidly, as too much heat will 'be apt to scorch or burn. 



Cal'c, Candy and Culinary Crinldes. 193 

They should be stirred gently during the whole process 
of cooking to prevent sticking to the bottom of the 
kettle. 

Fondant. 

As fondant keeps well packed in stone jars and is 
much easier to make when made in large quantities, 
^he formula will be given so it can be divided when 
a small quantity is wanteds and doubled, where a 
very large batch is desired. Mix itogether five cups of 
granulated sugar^ two cups of cold vv^ater, put on the 
fctove and stir constantly until thoroughly dissolved. 
Wash down the sides of the kettle with a small pastry 
brush dipped in hot water, keep the sides of the kettle 
cleaned of any grains of sugar that form. Cover over 
and when it begins to boil, remove the cover and add 
one-fourth teaspoon of cream 'of tartar. Cook to the 
soft ball stage. If a thermometer is used, cook to 238. 
Pour on marble, slightly oiled, use olive oil, not but^ 
ter. When cool, begin to work from the outer edge 
toward the center, using the fondant kneader. If a 
platter is used, make a small quantity, cool as quickly 
as possible and work with a wooden spoon. When it 
begins to cream, 'knead v\'ell until smooth. Put in a 
bowl or stone jar. Cover ever with a damp cloth and 
set in a cool place. It is better to stand a day or two 
before using. A little cold water sprinkled over the 
top helps to keep the fondant from graining. It should 
be a mass of pure white cream, looking like lard. It 



19-i Calce, Candy and Culinary CrinUes. 

should be so firm you can cut it with a knife, and 
should melt in the mouth, leaving absolutely no grain. 
If there is a grain, it has either been stirred while 
boiling, shaken while cooking, or stirred before it was 
cool enough. This candy can be made into balls and 
Tolled in chopped nuts, or covered with chocolate, nuts 
worked into it and cut in squares; it can be colored 
with different fruit coloring; cinnamon is used to roll 
oblong pieces making potatoes. Eoll in cocoanut for 
cocoanut balls. There are many ways of using fond- 
ant. It is the foundation of all French candies. Candy 
pudding can be made by adding fruits and nuts and 
making into shapes. 

Suggestions in Coloring, Flavoring and Shaping 
Bonbons. 

Fondant can ibe ooloied pink, green, yellow, violet or 
any color desired, flavoring added to suit the color or 
one's taste, finiits and nuts added and shaped with the 
hands, or the fondant melted and poured from a dropper 
into starch boxes and made into fancy shapes. If 'the 
bonbons are colored pink, use rose as a flavor, if green 
use pistachio, almond or mint, if lavender use violet or 
vanilla, use orange or lemon extract for the yellow ; these 
are only suggestions, one's own taste in>ust he consulted 
as to color, flavor and shape. 

Chopped candied fruits, cherries, pineapple, green- 
gage pluins and apric-ots are all used to mix with bon- 
bons, also candied' orange, lemon and grape fruit peel. 



Cal-e, Candy and Culinary Criiikles. 195 

Cr}'stallized vioilets and' rose leaves make an effective 
garnish as do pistachio nuts, ahnouds, pecans, English 
walnuts and cocoanut. 

Figs, dates and nuts ground together, made into 
eliape, and dipped in fondant make a delicious confec- 
tion, as does divinity, fudges, caramels or nougats. 

Almonds blanched and' toasted., dipped first in 
fondant and then chocolate coated are good. Any of the 
bonhons can be twice dipped, first in fondant or cream 
■caramel and then chocolate coated. 

How to Dip in Fondant 

Put the fondant in a double boiler and set over hot 
-v^^ater, add a small quantity of water if too stiff. 
Stir now and then, when it melts, throw in a 
bonbon and lift out wath the wire used for the p'ur- 
pose. Dry on heavy waxed paper. Continue this till 
all are dipped. If the fondant should get cool and too 
stiff put again over hot water. This can be colored 
pink, green or any desired color. Melt with a small de- 
gree of heat. 

Fondant for Mints. 

Three cups of sugar, one cup of water, two drops of 
acetic acid, stir until dissolved. Cook to the soft 
ball stage. Pour on slab which has been wet with cold 
water. \Yhen cool work with spatula until it creams.

dish. Vriieii it begins to harden so that it makes a dent 
when pressed by the finger, gather it all in a lump and 
pull unitil it gets light and creamy; pull the flavoring 
into it and make it into long, thin strips and cut into 
one or two inche pieces. By the use -of fruit coloring, 
tills candy can be made any desired color by putting in 
the coloring after the candy has been pulled white. 
Continue to pull until the coloring hasi been uniform- 
ly mixed through. 

When cold and firm put in a tin box and cover tight 
and it will become creamy and melting. This candy

of cream; put sugar, glucose and two cups of cream 
on ithe fire and stir constantly, cook until when 
dropped in cold water it can be taken between the 
fingers and shaped into a soft ball, then add one cup 
of cream gradually as not to disturb the boiling. Cook

cut with a sharp knife. Wrap and put in tin boxes ; in 
cutting caramels never push (the knife hard, but cut 
with a sliding movement, pressing through the batch 
and from you with the same movement, this gives a 
clean cut edge. In warm or diamp weather they will 
lose their shape unless they are wrapped.

fondant. When it gets stiff from working^ cover over 
with a wet cloth and put a dry one on top of the wet, let 
stand several hours or longer. This candy can be shap- 
ed for caramels or in any wiay as it is quite pliable 
and soft. 

Line a pan with waxed paper and press the candy 
into it, cover over with paper, let stand some hours 
and cut into caramels. Make some into balls and ob- 
longs, roll in cinnamon or dip in chocolate. Fruits 
and nuts can be add andi made into bonbons and 
dipped or not m fondant. Candy pudding or rolls are 
made from this candy by working in fruits and nuts 
and pressing into moulds or shaping with the hands 
into a long round two or three inches thick and cover- 
ing with cinnamon or chocolate, cutting in slices when 
needed. In boxing candy pudding always wrap in 
oiled paper as it keeps fresh much longer and prevents 
the other candies in the box from mashing it and 
spoiling the shape. 

In making caramels two kinds can be moulded to- 
gether. Make batches at the same time in the same 
quantity and pour one on top of the other ; one kind of 
nuts and flavorings added to one and a different kind to 
the other. M.arshmallow mixture is sometimes put 
between tv/o layers. This is pretty and very good.

for fifteen to thirty-five cents a jar. The colors 
ordinarily used are golden yellow, damask ro,se, violet 
and leaf green. It takes a very small quantity of paste 
to color la very large quantity of mixture, so it is 
important to use too little at first rather than too 
much. WTiat will adhere to the point of a small skewer 
will color a quant of liquid or a pint of solid mixture. 
Avoid having too deep coloring.
