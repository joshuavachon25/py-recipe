Complete Cook Book 



DEDICATORY PREFACE 

To My Fellozv Housekeepers , North, East, South and West : 

THIRTY-ONE years ago I wrote, dedicated to you, and sent to 
press, COMMON SENSE IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 

The daring step was taken in direct opposition to the advice of 
all who knew my purpose. I was assured that I should lose the 
modest measure of literary reputation I had won by novels, short 
stories and essays if I persisted in the ignoble enterprise. 

One critic forewarned me that "whatever I might write after 
this preposterous new departure would be tainted, for the imag- 
inative reader and reviewer, with the odor of the kitchen." 

He may have been right. I do not know nor do I care whether 
his judgment or mine was the better. I gave my first cook-book 
to you because I knew from my own experience, as a young, raw 
and untaught housekeeper, that you needed just what I had to 
say. The hundreds of thousands of copies which have been sold, 
the thousands of grateful letters received from my toiling sisters, 
testify to that need and that to me was appointed the gracious 
task of supplying it. 

Under the impulse of a conviction as solemn and as strong I 
offer you now a work embodying the best results of mature 
Housewifery. Or, as I would rather name it, Housemotherhood. 
Before I put pen to paper I stipulated that the contract with the 
publishers of THE COMPLETE COOK BOOK should contain a 
clause forbidding me to prepare and issue any book of a similar 
character during the next ten years. 

Whatever I have to say to you through the medium of a 
printed and bound volume in all these years must be said here. 

I have had this thought in my mind with the writing of every 
page. In every page, in every line, in every word I have done 

i

my best to serve you. I know you well enough to be assured that 
you will not forget this. If such a thing might be I would have 
every dish compounded according to my directions a souvenir to 
each of you of one who has given thirty-odd of the best years of 
a busy life to the task of dignifying housewifery into a profes- 
sion, and ennobling the practice of it in your eyes. 

For the fair degree of success which has followed these efforts 
I am thankful. Thankful, too, to those of you whose apprecia- 
tion of my aim and my work has held up weary hands and stayed 
the failing heart. 

This talk, made purposely as "familiar" as if I were face-to- 
face with each of you, is not a valedictory, but an au revoir. 
The book in your hands contains the gleanings of an active dec- 
ade. Housewifery keeps pace with other professions in the 
swinging march of an Age of Wonders. I have faith in it and in 
myself to believe that I shall go on with the fascinating work of 
accumulating. I add, hopefully, I have also faith in you that, in 
the future as in the thirty years overpast, you will aid me in that 
accumulation. 

MARION HARLAND. 




MARKETING 

MUTTON and BEEF may be called the Marketer's Perennials. 
They are in season all the year round. 

In buying mutton see that the fat is clear, very firm and white ; 
the flesh close of grain, and ruddy. Buy your meat fresh, even if 
you mean to hang it in the cellar for a week or longer in cold 
weather. "Begin fair!" 

The best cuts of mutton are loin, saddle and leg. French 
chops are cut from the rib, the fat taken off and several inches of 
the bone cleaned from meat. They are nice to look at, good to 
eat and expensive. You can do the trimming at home when 
you have once seen it done and save the extra cent or two paid 
for the word "French." Loin chops are cheaper and usually 
more tender and better-flavored. 

A more economical piece than the leg for the housewife who 
does her own marketing is the fore-quarter. You can bone and 
stuff part of it for a roast ; the chops are almost as good as those 
cut from the loin, and the bones, when removed, make good 
stock for broth. The meat is really more juicy and sweet than 
that of the leg, and the cost from two to three cents a pound 
less. 

LAMB is in season from May to November. What is sold un- 
der that name in winter is undersized mutton, and usually tough 
and dry. 

BEEF the Englishman's main-stay is quite as important in 
the American kitchen. Seek, in purchasing, for rosy, red meat, 
"shot" with cream-colored suet, dry and mealy, and a good outer 
coat of fat. Press the meat hard with the tip of your thumb. 
If it be flabby, and, after yielding to pressure, retains the dent, 
let it alone. 



4 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

The rib roast is a choice cut. It is more comely when the 
bones are removed, the meat rolled and bound into a round. In 
which case insist upon having the trimmings sent home. You 
pay for them, and, when you order soup-meat, for that as well. 
Have the bones cracked, buy one pound of coarse lean beef for 
perhaps ten cents, and you have foundation for a good gravy 
soup, or stock enough for several hashes and stews. 

The round costs about two-thirds as much as a rib-roast and 
half as much as a sirloin, and serves admirably for a la mode 
beef, or a pot-roast. 

The sirloin steak is far more economical than a porterhouse. 
Remove the bone before cooking. This cut often contains really 
more of the coveted tenderloin than the porterhouse, and the rest 
of the steak is more tender, as a rule, than the dearer cut. Have 
the steak cut at least an inch thick. 

Summer FRESH PORK is less desirable than winter lamb. It 
should be barred from the market after the first of May, and not 
allowed there before December first, if then. The lean should be 
pink, the fat pure white and solid, the skin like white, translucent 
parchment. That it is cheap and "goes far" recommends it to 
many people. 

The chine, the spareribs and loin are the best cuts for roast- 
ing. Pork chops are popular, and pork tenderloins much affect- 
ed, even by epicures. Children and invalids should never touch 
unsalted pork at its best estate. 

VEAL comes into market earlier than genuine spring lamb, and 
is seasonable all the summer through. Be sure it is not that 
most objectionable variety of what is rated by dieticians as a de- 
cidedly objectionable meat known in slang usage as "bob-veal." 
No calf should be slaughtered until at least six weeks old. The 
meat should be a clear, pale red, the fat very white, the texture 
firm. Veal may be innutritious, but the knuckle and, indeed, all 
the bony parts are invaluable for soups, containing much gelatin- 
ous matter. The breast, the fillet and loin are the most popular 
roasting pieces. Veal chops are really better eating and cheaper 
than the cutlet, and should be better known to the frugal house- 
wife. 



MARKETING 5 

A calf's head, scraped free of hair and well-cleaned, may be 
bought in country markets for fifty cents, and can be made 
into a dainty dish fit for John and John's unexpected friend. 

Sweetbreads are an acknowledged delicacy, and liver, properly 
cooked, will be approved by all. 

By the way, lamb's liver costs less than calf's liver, and is 
more toothsome. 

In choosing POULTRY, slip your bare forefinger under the wing 
where it joins the body and press hard with the nail. If the skin 
breaks easily, the fowl is probably young. Then try the tip of 
the breast-bone. If the cartilage gives readily and springs back- 
slowly, the signs are still favorable. Next, look for hairs on the 
body and hard horny scales on the legs ; for scrawny necks and 
a livid hue in the flesh all unfavorable indications. Tough 
fowls should be cheaper far than tender. If your market-man 
calls them frankly ''fowls," commend his honesty, and if you 
contemplate a fricassee or chicken pie, reward his integrity by a 
purchase. Chickens may be "fowls," yet good, that is, nourish- 
ing and amenable to judicious "tendering." 

A veteran housewife, with a reputation to support, tells me 
she has but one method of securing really excellent meats for her 
table : "When a market-man sells me tough flesh, or superan- 
nuated poultry, or ancient fish, I give him warning. At the sec- 
ond offense, I transfer my custom to another dealer. The rule 
works well !" 

It is especially useful when one would be certain of getting 
FRESH FISH. Now that fish and oysters are bedded h *ce until 
the wiliest connoisseur may be mistaken in their age, it behooves 
the housemother to know, first of all, that she is dealing with a 
man with a conscience as free from reproach as she would have 
her halibut, salmon and oysters, 



CARE OF HOUSEHOLD STORES 

APPLES, POTATOES, TURNIPS, CARROTS, BEETS, etc., if stored in 
bins or barrels, should be picked over every week. The defective 
should be thrown away, and if there be any sign of sweating, the 
good should be spread out on the floor for a day or two to dry 
before they are repacked. Fruit should be handled with care. 
Bruises are incipient decay. 

Particularly FINE FRUIT apples and pears should be 
wrapped, each separately, in soft, imprinted paper and, when 
packed, covered with fine, dry sand. Thus protected, they will 
keep plump and sweet for months, and need no overhauling 
meanwhile. 

When practicable, keep VEGETABLES in large quantities else- 
where than in the cellar under your dwelling. Putrefying roots, 
cabbages and apples were responsible for much of the winter and 
spring diseases that puzzled our forefathers and mothers. Even 
now many a farmhouse reeks with "cellar smells," as subtile and 
dangerous as sewer gas. 

Keep EGGS in a cool place, yet not where they will be liable to 
freeze. If you store them in large quantities, pack in dry salt, 
the small end down. As an additional precaution, grease the 
shells, and pour melted lard upon the topmost layer of salt. 

DRIED BEANS AND PEAS should be kept in wooden or tin boxes 
with close tops. 

Have canisters with tight lids for COFFEE AND TEA, and keep 
them shut. Coffee loses strength and flavor when exposed to the 
air. Tea softens and molds. 

In buying CRACKERS give the preference to those packed in tin 
cases. If they come in paper boxes, set these in tin receptacles, 
or in stone crocks with snugly fitting tops. Never throw away a 
tin cracker-box. It is always useful. 

6 



CARE OF HOUSEHOLD STORES 7 

After CHEESE is cut, wrap in tin-foil, or in soft (unprinted) 
paper and keep in tin, or in stoneware. 

CRUSTS, BITS OF TOAST, BROKEN CRACKERS AND STALE SLICES 
of bread should be kept in the kitchen closet until perfectly dry ; 
then set in a moderate oven for an hour before crushing them 
with a rolling-pin. Keep these crumbs in a glass jar with a close 
top. They are invaluable for breading chops and croquettes, 
and for scallops. 

Brown FLOUR by the quantity, and when cool put into glass 
jars ready for use. 

SALT cakes and hardens in damp weather. Store it in your 
warmest and driest pantry. In very wet weather mix a little 
corn starch with that you put into the table salt-cellars.- 

FLOUR can not be kept too dry, nor can INDIAN OATMEAL, and 
all kinds of SUGAR. PULVERIZED SUGAR is as susceptible to humid- 
ity as salt. Tin boxes are absolutely necessary for keeping it 
tolerably free from lumps. 

SPICES, PEPPER AND DRIED HERBS must also be shut up closely, 
and never be kept in open receptacles. Some brands of BAKING- 
POWDERS actually effervesce when exposed for days at a time to 
the open air. All are injured seriously by such exposure. 

For all these staples and ingredients, have closely-fitting lids 
and keep them on! 

Store DRIED FRUITS in stone jars with covers ; CANNED FRUITS 
AND PICKLES in glass jars; tumblers of JELLY AND MARMALADE 
should be kept in the dark. The light acts chemically upon the 
contents. If your storeroom be light, wrap jars and tumblers 
in thick paper tied on with strings. 

As soon as MEAT comes home from market remove every bit 
of the brown paper enveloping it, and lay upon a clean dish near 
the ice never upon it. FISH does not suffer from contact with 
ice. Meat does, becoming flabby and viscid. If your refrigera- 
tor is so arranged that you can hang the meat up, that the air 
can get at all sides of it, it will keep far better than when laid 
on a platter. 

A good meat preserver is a box, as large as you can make room 
for in the refrigerator, the top and bottom of which are of wood, 



8 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the sides of wire netting. Stout hooks are screwed into the in- 
side of the top, and one of the netted sides is hinged, like a door. 
MEAT hung in this box will remain untainted and sweet much 
longer than when hung upon the side of the refrigerator. If 
you have a cool cellar, keep the meat box, thus prepared, upon a 
shelf in the darkest corner. The netting excludes insects, yet 
allows the air to enter, and by drying the surface forms an im- 
pervious coating which will keep in the juices. 

Get large tin boxes for BREAD AND CAKE. Scald them fre- 
quently, drying thoroughly in the sun, and have clean, dry 
cloths in which to wrap each fresh batch of cake and baking of 
bread and biscuits. 

It is an excellent plan to make cotton bags in which to put 
LETTUCE, CELERY, TOMATOES, SPINACH and other green things you 
wish to store in the refrigerator. The shelves and ice-box are kept 
clean, the esculents fresh. Many housewives have adopted the 
expedient within a few years, and none have abandoned it after 
a trial. The bags are of coarse, light cotton cloth, or of cheese- 
cloth, and go into the weekly wash. 

TABLE BUTTER, wrapped in dampened cheesecloth squares, 
keeps sweet and firm. These squares are as large as a child's 
pocket handkerchief, and hemmed to prevent raveling. Half a 
dozen will last a year, unless the "hired gurrel" takes them for 
dish-cloths. 

BUTTER, made into balls for the table, should be kept in a bowl 
of cold water in the refrigerator, and the water changed every 
morning. 



KITCHEN UTENSILS 

IT is not my purpose to discourage the housewife by a list of 
culinary furniture. 

The readers of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" may recall that Mr. St. 
Clair declared the evolution of irreproachable course dinners 
through such means as his negro cook employed in a smoky little 
kitchen with scanty store of pots and kettles to be "nothing 
short of genius." I have, before now, visited kitchens environed 
with pot-closets, where hung a glittering assortment of every 
conceivable patented "indispensable" and sat down in the din- 
ing-room to greasy, watery soups, scorched meats, soggy bread 
and curdled custards. 

It is well to have a plentiful supply of tools. If there be not 
sense and skill behind them, failure is a foregone conclusion. 

The object of this brief chapter is to tell our housemothers 
how to keep such pots and kettles, griddles and pans in working 
order, and how to make them last a reasonable time. 

To begin with get good ware. The clumsy iron vessels that 
gathered grime and soot over the fires kept up by our grand- 
dames have been pushed aside by lighter and cleaner utensils of 
various sorts. Coppers that must be as bright outside as they 
were within, and gathered unto themselves murderous verdigris, 
if not cleaned before each using, with salt and scalding vinegar 
were banished, and righteously, long ago, in favor of galvanized, 
porcelain, granite, agate-iron and nickel-steel-plated wares that 
neither rust nor green-mold. These wares are as easily kept 
clean as stone china, and if less durable than iron and copper 
that descended from mother to daughter and even down to the 
third generation, last reasonably well when properly handled. 

Pots, kettles and the like should be set upon the range not 



io MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

thumped and banged. A nicked cooking utensil is a disgrace to 
the handler thereof. 

Cracks and scaling-off are still oftener the result of sudden 
overheating and of allowing an empty vessel to stand over the 
fire. The teakettle boils dry, the soup seethes and simmers un- 
til bones and meat stick to the bottom of the pot. To complete 
the wreck, the ignorant or indifferent cook snatches off the mis- 
used utensil and runs with it to the sink, turning the cold-water 
faucet upon the heated metal. Yet the mistress marvels at the 
semi-yearly necessity of replenishing kitchen tools ! 

Never put away a vessel which is not both clean and dry. 
Wash with hot water, good soap, and household ammonia. Use 
mop and soap-shaker, if you would spare your hands and do jus- 
tice to bottoms, seams and sides of pot and pan. Rinse off the 
suds, wipe and set, upside down, upon the range for thirty sec- 
onds to make assurance doubly sure. 

Hang up everything that furnishes the semblance of a loop 
by which it may be suspended. And always in its own place, so 
that you could find each in the dark. 

Cover the shelves of the crockery closet with strips of scal- 
loped oilcloth that come for the purpose, and the shelves on 
which you keep metal pie-plates and pans with stout paper, 
pinked at the edges. 

If you use tin milk-pans, have them seamless, scald daily with 
boiling water into which you have stirred a little baking soda, 
rinse with pure water and stand in the sun. 

Wooden ware should be scrubbed with a clean, stiff brush 
and soda-and-water, rinsed well, wiped and dried near the fire 
or in the open window. 

Buy three qualities of dish-towels the finest for glass, silver 
and china ; the second best for crockery used in kitchen work ; 
the third for heavy kettles, griddles, etc., and have them washed 
every day. Even when no grease adheres to them they have a 
musty odor if used several times without washing. 

Rub gridirons and griddles with dry salt before each using, 
wiping it off with a clean towel. 



KITCHEN UTENSILS n 

Never undertake to polish your stove until it is quite cold, 
and do not rekindle the fire too soon when the polishing- is done. 

Next to the range, or stove, the sink is the most important fea- 
ture of the kitchen. 

"Let me see a woman's sink, and I will tell you what sort of 
a manager she is !" was the saying of a shrewd housemother who 
had seen much of life and of cooks. 

The waste-pipe should be flushed every day when the water 
in the boiler is hottest. During the flushing two tablespoonfuls 
of strong ammonia should be poured down the grating over the 
waste. Once a week in summer add a handful of crushed wash- 
ing-soda. And keep the sink, itself, clean all the time! 

Grease should never accumulate upon the sides and in the 
corners ; tea leaves and other debris never be clotted over the vent. 

A stout whisk-brush must hang above the sink and be used 
freely in scrubbing it. When the whisk becomes stained and 
flabby, burn it up and get another. A dirty brush, mop or dish- 
cloth makes not removes dirt. 

Follow these directions, and if the outer drain-pipes are prop- 
erly built, you will have no occasion to employ disinfectants and 
deodorizers. 



CHEMISTRY IN THE KITCHEN 

HERE again I shall be brief and practical. Nobody would read 
this page were I to prate learnedly (apparently) of proteids, 
phosphates, dextrine, hyposulphites and computed chemical and 
dietetic values. The purpose of the honest cook-book is to help, 
not hinder. 

A few facts relative to chemical effects and changes in every- 
day cookery should be tabulated. 

For example, the mission of the much-used and oft-abused 
bicarbonate of soda familiarly called "baking-soda'' is im- 
perfectly apprehended by those who handle it most frequently. 
The average cook does this handling heavily. "Soda makes 
bread and biscuits rise," is the sum of her knowledge and the aim 
of her practice in this direction. 

Soda should be measured as accurately as if it were a potent 
drug, and never used except in combination with an acid. Even 
then, lean to the side of mercy in measuring. One even tea- 
spoonful of soda to two rounded teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, 
one even teaspoonful of soda to two cupfuls of buttermilk, or 
"bonny clabber," one even teaspoonful of soda to one cupful 
(one-half pint) of molasses, cause what may be considered an 
equitable effervescence, liberating gases that lighten dough and 
batter without making them unwholesome. The "greeny-yel- 
lowy" streaks in farmhouse quick biscuits are poisonous, but the 
alkali is not in fault. Soda should never be driven in single 
harness. 

The first stage of incipient decomposition is acidity. If, when 
a slightly-suspected fowl or cut of meat is to be boiled or stewed, 
a teaspoonful of soda be thrown into the pot as soon as the boil 
begins, violent effervescence will attest the presence of the dis- 

12 



CHEMISTRY IX THE KITCHEN 13 

turbing acid. This subsiding will leave the meat free from un- 
pleasant taint. 

Beefsteak and chops, which are just a trifle "touched," may be 
restored to sanity by a bath of soda and water, well rubbed in. 
Butter that has suffered in quality through the neglect of the 
maker in not working all the milk out may be made tolerable for 
kitchen use by working it over in iced water in which a little soda 
has been dissolved. After which the butter should be wrapped in 
a salted cloth with a lump of charcoal in the outer fold. 

Ammonia is another beneficent agent in correcting natural or 
artificial deficiencies. A bottle of household ammonia should 
be as invariably an adjunct to the kitchen sink and that of the 
waitress's pantry as the soap-dish. It "kills" grease by a chemi- 
cal combination with it, and lends luster to silver by the same. 

Dry soda, laid upon a burn or scald, heals, but not merely by 
excluding the air. Flour would do that as well. The alkali acts 
directly upon the decomposing skin and vitiated juices of the 
flesh. The sting of a bee, wasp or hornet is formic acid ; that 
of a mosquito something akin to it. Ammonia, applied instant- 
ly, neutralizes the venom and eases the smart. 

In the composition of salad dressing, stirring the oil, vinegar, 
salt, pepper and dash of mustard together, long and skilfully, 
makes a chemical emulsion smoother and more palatable than the 
hasty slap-dash mixture too often served as "French dressing." 

Bread-dough which has begun to sour can be brought to terms 
by working into the batch a little saleratus dissolved in boiling 
water, which is then allowed to become lukewarm before it is 
kneaded faithfully through the dough. A like solution should be 
beaten hard into griddle-cake batter that has a pungent smell. 

Vinegar and lemon juice are invaluable aids in the business of 
"tendering" tough meats. Beefsteak, covered for some hours 
with vinegar or lemon juice, and olive oil, is made eatable by the 
action of the acid upon the fibers which are further "suppled" 
by the oil. 

Vinegar put into the water in which a fowl or mutton is boiled 
will serve the same purpose, and a dash of vinegar in boiling fish 
removes the strong oily taste that would otherwise cling to it. 



14 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Powdered alum stirred into turbid water an even tablespoon- 
ful to four gallons will cause a precipitate and a settlement. 
The clear water may be drawn off cautiously and used for wash- 
ing and even for drinking, having no perceptible taste of the 
alum. 

A bag of powdered charcoal sunk in a pork barrel will keep 
the brine sweet through the winter, without blackening it or the 
meat. 



CARVING 

THE present mode of serving meats after the manner of the 
table d'hote the carving done in the kitchen, and the results 
placed upon the platter to be served to the guests by butler or 
waiter has in large measure done away with the demand for 
hints to the master or mistress of the home upon the art of carv- 
ing. To those who adhere to the earlier custom, directions can 
be merely outlines; for the single means by which one may be- 
come an adept as a carver is in the repeated practice which is re- 
quired for skill in any work of manipulation. 

A prerequisite to carving is appropriate implements. The 
knife, the edge of which has been dulled upon the bread-board, 
or hacked in the offices of the kitchen, where it has been em- 
ployed as the scullion's tool, may puncture and tear, but it w;ll 
not carve. In the hand of even the most skilful it is exaspera- 
tion. 

The mistress of the home owes it to the head of the table, as 
well as to the ease of mind of her guests, .to see that the carving 
set the knife and its companion fork shall be in the best con- 
dition for their work. 

To carve a roast of beef 

This will depend upon the form in which the roast is placed 
upon the platter. If it include several ribs, furnishing suffi- 
cient room for a base of bone, it may be so put before the carver 
that he may cut perpendicularly in thin slices, passing the knife 
in a line parallel with the ribs. If, however, the roast be laid 
upon the side, as is usual, the same direction is to be observed 
as to the cutting in lines parallel to the ribs. 

15 



16 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Where a tenderloin roast is to be carved having but the one 
large bone which divides the tenderloin from the more solid por- 
tion there is little choice whether the knife is drawn with or 
transversely to the grain : the tenderness of the meat is assured 
in either case. It may be more convenient to sever entirely the 
tenderloin from the firmer part of the roast before beginning to 
slice. This will leave the carver at liberty to serve a portion of 
each quality of the meat to every guest, as the tenderloin may 
not be of sufficient size to serve to all. 

To carve a leg of lamb or mutton 

If the small ribs which are generally taken off for chops 
are left with the leg, the carver is free to ask the preference of 
each guest for the rib or solid slice. The chops may be detached 
by drawing the point of the knife between the ribs, and if the 
butcher has properly done his part in severing the light carti- 
lage at the backbone, as in parting vertebrae. The fleshy por- 
tion of the leg will be more tender if cut in slices at a right angle 
with the bone, as one would carve a ham ; that is, across the grain. 
Some carvers, however, prefer to cut lamb or mutton with the 
grain, as it enables them to serve a portion more or less thor- 
oughly cooked, according to the preference of those to be helped. 
These directions apply equally to carving a haunch of venison. 

To carve poultry 

The fowl whether turkey, chicken or duck should be placed 
on its back upon the platter. This will permit the carver to 
transfix the breastbone firmly with the fork ; for, upon the 
stanchness of the hold here will depend the success of all further 
operations. The wing from the nearer side should first be dis- 
severed by a gash of the knife underneath the socket. This, if 
the fowl be tender, is easily accomplished with a single cut. The 
first and second joints of the leg may next be separated, and the 
second or upper joint removed from its junction with the body, 
as was the wing. This is easily effected by a slight cut and pres- 



CARVING 17 

sure of the bone outward. The sidebone may be taken off by 
running the blade directly along the backbone ; for it adheres only 
by a filament of skin and the soft fat that attaches to it on this 
line. 

These joints having been taken off, the breast is now entirely 
exposed, and further carving is a very simple matter. The re- 
moval of the leg has laid bare the cavity, from which the dress- 
ing may be lifted with a spoon, and the cutting of a few slices 
from the breast, near the neck, will open the crop with the stuf- 
fing usually placed there to plump the fowl. The main joint and 
the pinion of the wing may be severed by cutting the cartilage at 
the junction of the two bones. 

To carve fish 

There is an art in carving fish, and it is confined to a single di- 
rection. It is to open with a knife at the back, drawing the 
blade the whole distance from head to tail just above the back- 
bone, and pressing the meat loose from its fastening. Portions 
may then be served by cutting transversely with the backbone. 
Fish so carved is freed from the intricate mass of small bones 
which are sure to mingle with the flesh if it be cut in any other 
way. The head, if not already removed, should first be taken off, 
and the collar or shoulder-bone lifted from the fish. 



SERVING AND WAITING 

IF a butler be engaged to do the family serving and waiting, 
he understands his business, or he should not apply for the place. 
The rules written out here are for the benefit of households 
where but one or, at the most, two maids are kept. I assume 
that the waitress takes charge of the table after the mistress has 
once shown her how it is to be set. 

By the way, I hope you call her a "maid," not a "girl." The 
latter word has been so rubbed and soiled by persistent usage on 
the part of domesticated foreigners, who shed the name of "serv- 
ant" as soon as they stamp upon American soil, and by the han- 
dling of would-be "genteel" housewives, that people of refine- 
ment hesitate to touch it. What the old-fashioned New England- 
ers called "hired help" would shake the dust off the soles of the 
shoes they are not yet quite used to wearing, were you to allude 
to them as "servants." "Maid" sounds well, bearing to their 
tickled ears a certain dignity not unsuited to their new estate. 

Beginning with the first meal of the day, we will suppose a 
cereal, fruit, one dish of meat, bread and butter, potatoes, hot 
muffins, tea and coffee a typical American breakfast, in fact. 

A fruit-plate, holding a doily, on which is a finger-bowl half- 
filled with water, cold in summer, tepid in winter, is set for each 
person. If fruit that requires paring or cutting is to be eaten, 
lay a fruit-knife on the plate. If oranges are served, add an 
orange-spoon. At the right of the plate are the water tumbler, 
a knife, with the sharp edge toward the plate, and a cereal- 
spoon, bowl upward. At the left should be the bread-and-butter 
plate, the fork, tines upward, and a folded napkin. 

In front of each plate are a pepper-cruet and a salt-cellar. 

In the center of the board have a bowl of flowers, or something 

18 




SERVING AND WAITING 19 

green and growing, all the year round. At the foot, carving- 
knife and fork, a steel or other "sharp- 
ener," and a tablespoon ; unless you have 
a polished table, cover it with a neat break- 
fast-cloth, using napkins ("serviettes") to 
match. If your table-top be at all pre- 
sentable, lay a hemstitched or embroidered 
square of linen sold as a "breakfast or 
luncheon square" in the center, and un- 
der each plate a doily of the same style. 
A thick mat to protect the varnish against 
the heated meat dish; a carafe, or glass pitcher, of ice-water on 
each side of the table, and the tea and coffee equipage at the head, 
complete the preparations for serving. 

The basket, or dish of fruit, is handed from the sideboard 
where are arranged tablespoons, the glass or silver tub of broken 
ice to replenish glasses, and, if there are no carafes on the table, 
a pitcher of iced water, with a relay of knives and forks in case 
an extra supply should be required on account of accidents. 

At the last minute, before the mistress is told at the sitting- 
room door that "breakfast is on," the glasses are filled with iced 
water, a firm ball of butter and a freshly-cut slice of bread are 
laid upon the small plate at the left of each place. 

When the family and guests are seated, the waitress, dressed 
in a neat gingham or print gown, a clean apron, with bretelles, 
bib and full skirt, and a white cap pinned above orderly hair 
(not used to cloak unkempt elf-locks), passes the fruit basket or 
dish to the mistress of the house from the left side ; then to each 
person at table. 

The fruit eaten, let the waitress, beginning as before, at the 
head of the table, take from the right side of each person, plate, 
knife and spoon in one hand, finger-bowl in the other, and re- 
move to a side table, or to the "waitress's pantry," where they 
are to be washed. Never pile plates and saucers upon one an- 
other, or upon a tray. The habit is slovenly and lazy. Still 
more displeasing is the scraping of plates at the side table, or 
within hearing of the eaters. 



20 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

If the cereal be cooked, it is usually served by the mistress of 
the house. In this case set the hot dish upon a mat beside or 
before her, when you have put a cereal saucer with a plate under 
it before each person. Have a tray, with a napkin or doily 
within it, ready to receive each saucer as it is filled ; offer to the 
eaters from the left, and when all are served pass sugar and 
cream on the tray. 

When the cereal has been discussed, remove first the dish, 
then the saucers, and bring in hot plates, quickly and dexterously 
setting one before each person. They should have been warmed 
through slowly in the kitchen, but not be so hot as to draw the 
varnish through the doilies. Next set the dish of hot meat, 
chicken or fish, in front of the carver. As each portion is laid 
upon a plate, the plate is set upon the tray you hold. Taking 
the plate in your hand when you reach the mistress of the house, 
set it down before her from the right. 

There need be no confusion in this much-debated question of 
"left and right" if the waitress will bear in mind one simple rule : 
When plate, cup or other article is to be taken from the tray 
by the eater, or he is to help himself from an offered dish, the 
waitress must stand on his left, that he may use his right hand 
freely. What the waitress puts upon the table with her own 
hand must be done from the right. 

For example, the plate with meat on it is set down from the 
right of the person who is thus served. He takes his cup of 
coffee and helps himself to sugar and cream from the left. 

Before the waitress leaves the breakfast-room for the 
pantry, if she does not remain throughout the meal, let her 
replenish glasses with water and ice, pass bread or muf- 
fins a second time, and if cups are emptied, offer her 
tray to take them back to the head of the table to be 
refilled. Should she begin to wash plates and saucers 
in the adjoining pantry to save time, let this be done very 
quietly. The rattle of china is not a musical accompani- 
ment to table-talk. 

The manner of setting the table and waiting at luncheon is 




SERVING AND WAITING 21 

substantially the same as at breakfast. Dinner demands certain 
variations, while the general principles are the same. 

The waitress of to-day has a dinner uniform, decorous in all, 
becoming to a large majority of women. She wears a black 
gown, deep white cuffs and collar, and an apron of finer material 
and somewhat more ornate in fashion than in the forenoon. 

Under the damask table-cloth is laid a covering of felt made 
for this purpose sold as "table-felt," or a "silence-cloth." The 
linen cover lies more smoothly over this and appears to be of 
better texture than when spread upon bare boards. Besides the 
damask table-cloth, a "carving square" is laid at the foot of the 
table, and under it a thick mat on which the hot dish may stand. 
On this are carving-knife, fork and "steel ;" also tablespoon and 
gravy ladle, leaving room between for the large dish. A cold 
plate stands at each place, to be taken up when the hot is set 
down by the waitress. At the right of the plate lie the soup- 
spoon, bowl uppermost, two knives, edges turned toward the 
plate, and a fish-knife (if there is to be fish) beyond the dinner- 
knives. A tumbler for water, and, if wine is used, glasses for 
this, stand also on the right, a little beyond the array of knives. 

Some prefer to lay the soup-spoon at right angles to the 
knives, and back of where the plate is to be. 

At the left of the plate have two large forks ; then one for fish, 
and outside of this an oyster-fork, if there are to be raw oysters. 
The napkin, folded flat, and inclosing a slice of bread, cut thicker 
and narrower than for breakfast, lies also on the left. 

Plates for the several courses are in array on the sideboard, 
except such as must be brought hot from the kitchen. Salad 
plates and those for dessert stand in order. Saucers for ices are 
set upon plates lined with doilies. Fruit plates are also sup- 
plied with doilies, on which are finger-bowls half-full of water. 

A side table is reserved for vegetable dishes. They are not 
placed upon the principal table now, even at the daily family din- 
ner. Pickles and olives are on the dinner-table ; carafes of water, 
and always flowers. 

Some housewives have soup served in hot plates directly from 
the kitchen. If the tureen be used instead, the mistress prefer- 



22 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ring to pour it out herself, have a carving-cloth at that end of the 
table also. The soup ladle lies at her right. As she ladles out 
the soup it is set on the waitress's tray. She takes it off with 
her hand and puts it from the right before any guest who may 
be present ; then the family in turn. At a dinner party; those on 
the right of the hostess are served first. The soup-plate is set 
upon the cold plate in front of the eater, and when removed is 
taken from the right, leaving the lower stationary cold plate in 
its place, until the fish comes, when it is exchanged for a hot one. 

In clearing the table after each course the soup-tureen, and in 
its turn the large dish at the foot of the table go out first, the 
soiled plates afterward. 

Before the dessert is brought in, crumb the table, using a 
clean folded napkin, when you have cleared the cloth of salt, 
pepper, pickles, etc. 

After the sweets comes the coffee. This is often sent to the 
guests into the drawing-room. In this case, the waitress covers 
a large tray with a white napkin, arranges the filled cups, smok- 
ing hot, upon it, sets the sugar in the middle and takes the whole 
into the room where the party is assembled. 

Liqueur-glasses follow the coffee, and are also carried into 
drawing-room or library. In announcing to the mistress, in 
sitting-room or elsewhere, that a meal is ready, the waitress says, 
"Breakfast is on," or "Luncheon is ready," or "Dinner is 
served" according to modern usage. One frightened unfor- 
tunate, on duty at a trial-dinner party, filled the hostess with 
confusion, the guests with secret amusement, by rattling off all 
three formulas in a breath. 

It is impossible to write out rules that will meet every form 
and exigency of "entertaining." The hostess who, having mas- 
tered the leading principles here given, trains her waitress into 
the daily practice of them, insisting that her family shall be 
served three times a day in the right order, and as punctiliously 
as if a state banquet were the business of the hour, need fear no 
embarrassing "situations," no matter how large the number, nor 
how important the stations of her guests. 



AMONG THE LINENS 

EVERYTHING commonly classed under this head should be care- 
fully aired before it is put away. Even when this duty has been 
conscientiously performed, real linen, made of pure flax, has 
marvelous properties for absorbing humidity. And humidity 
is the parent of that relentless foe to housewifely peace mildew. 
Table-cloths, napkins and linen sheets that have been packed 
securely as the owner supposed in closets, drawers and chests, 
sometimes present to our horrified eyes a collection of small 
blotches, like dark freckles, and as ineradicable, and the folds, 
when opened, smell musty. The walls of the closet were not 
quite dry, or the chest has stood in a damp room, or the side- 
board drawers have gathered must in an unaired basement din- 
ing-room. 

It is a matter of common prudence to overhaul the contents of 
linen closets, and especially linen drawers and chests, once a 
month, if only to make sure that the contents are keeping well. 
At the same time be on the lookout for rents, broken threads and 
thin places. 

Never buy cheap linen. If you can not afford the finest, you 
may secure that which is "all linen," round-threaded *and evenly 
woven. A little practice in the purchase of these treasures will 
initiate you into the art of judicious choosing. Having bought 
good "material," take care of it. A break in a table-cloth or nap- 
kin, or towel, if neatly darned, will give you several more weeks 
of wear out of it perhaps months. Hemstitched articles are 
liable to "give" first in the drawn work, and a stitch here in time, 
saves ninety. 

You may keep napery in drawers, if more convenient than else- 
where, or upon shelves in a roomy sideboard. When at all prac- 

23 



24 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ticable have a light, airy closet for bed linen. My own linen- 
room, built to order, has a southern window, unshuttered, 
through which the sun streams all the afternoon on fine days. 
Except in wet weather this window stands open for an hour of 
every day not longer, lest dust should blow in. 

Suffer another personal paragraph : Not a sheet, towel or 
pillow-case is taken from this closet except by myself. Each 
pile has place and meaning. Each set of towels belongs to an 
especial apartment. Heavy bath towels; soft damask for the 
leastest baby's use ; big, rough huckaback for the boys' lake baths, 
and the orderly heaps of different styles and textures, every one 
marked with embroidered letter or monogram designating cham- 
ber or owner are known familiarly to but one person in the 
family. , 

I modestly commend this rule to each housemother. Let the 
linen shelves be the especial charge of some one particular keeper. 
If not yourself, one of your daughters. This is rendered almost 
necessary by the system of rotation that should regulate the use 
of sheets, pillow-cases, counterpanes and towels. Those which 
come from the wash this week should be kept by themselves. 
In laying out clothes for the beds, and towels for the various 
rooms, select from the bottom of the pile of those laundered on'e, 
two or four weeks ago, working gradually upward, week by 
week, until all have gone through the wash and consequently, all 
are evenlv worn. Never make up a bed with freshly washed 
linen, no matter how well aired it may seem to be. 

Sheets, pillow-cases, towels, table-cloths all folded linens 
should be laid upon the shelves with the open and hemmed ends 
toward the wall, the round folds outward. The effect is neater 
to the eye, and articles are more easily taken out. 

There should be no smell in this airy closet except the inde- 
scribable sweet sense of freshly laundered linen not strong 
enough to be called an odor. Lavender, scented grasses, and 
dried rose leaves are poetical in the writing and the hearing 
thereof, but the sleeper between smooth cotton or linen sheets 
sickens of artificial smells. They are neither "goodly," nor 
wholesome. 



THE CHILDREN 

OUR forefathers and foremothers were dressed, in infancy, 
precisely like their fathers and mothers. As we see by the por- 
traits treasured among our curios, they were abridged copies of 
the adults of a hundred years ago. Parents were then consistent 
in feeding their progeny with food they considered convenient 
for themselves. 

When the royal father ate fermenty for breakfast it is upon 
record that a baby prince, suffering from marasmus, was nour- 
ished ( !) upon barley, boiled soft with raisins. They sat up to 
late functions those wretchedly dissipated princelings and the 
cotter's children went to bed at the same time with himself. 

He who doubts whether or not our times are better than the 
former would be converted to steadfastness of conviction by 
patient study of the nursery habits of the late eighteenth and early 
nineteenth centuries. 

We have children's outfitters nowadays, who fashion gar- 
ments utterly unlike those worn by be-corseted, be-trained, and 
be-pantalooned grown people. The cotter's wife clothes her boys 
in knickerbockers and blouses, her girls in loose waists and brief 
skirts, all designed expressly although she does not know it 
to allow free and healthful growth of the immature creatures. 

I wish I could add that reform as radical and common-sensible 
had been wrought in children's diet, and children's hours of rest 
and sleep. 

Mothers who have thought deeply upon these matters and 
acted upon meditation, appreciate the hygienic law that children 
require sleep to promote growth, as well as to repair the waste of 
waking which are working hours. If an adult needs seven 
hours' slumber, the infant of days under seven years of age 

25 



26 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

requires ten to satisfy wants his senior has outgrown. Up to 
the age when the child ceases to add inches, if not cubits, to his 
stature yearly, provision must be made for the steady drain upon 
vital and nerve forces. 

The aforesaid canny mothers call in the little ones from play 
before sundown in summer, bathe them, endue them in night- 
gowns and pajamas, put dressing-gowns over these, and loose 
slippers upon the tired feet, then set them down to a supper of 
bread and milk, or buttered bread with a dash of jam or jelly, 
and good, sweet milk, with once in a while a plain cooky as an 
afterthought. Supper over and prayers said, the darlings are 
laid in bed by the time the west begins to blush at the sun's 
nearer approach. In winter, the six o'clock supper is served in 
the nursery or dining-room, and the bairnies disposed of com- 
fortably to themselves and to the rest of the household before 
"grown-uppers" sit down to the "hearty" supper or dinner divid- 
ing the working day from an evening as busy, and sometime 
.almost as long. 

To borrow from the slang dictionary the child needs the ten 
or twelve hours' sleep in his business of growing tall and robust, 
steady of nerve and sane of mind. Furthermore, he needs food 
adapted to his needs. Plenty of cereals ; plenty of milk ; plenty 
of ripe fruit in the season thereof ; meat once a day ; nourishing 
broths and a few green vegetables. No fried things whatsoever ; 
neither tea nor coffee. No pastry ; no mince pie nor plum pud- 
ding, nor highly seasoned entrees. Time enough for these delica- 
cies when the inches (and feet) are all in, the muscles in splendid 
working order, the gray matter of the brain "all there," and 
ready to do the duties of a man's brain for fifty years to come. 

One branch of a child's education, sorely neglected in tens of 
thousands of homes, is mastication. As soon as he cuts his teeth 
teach him why they were given him. Make him chew everything 
he takes into his mouth. Able dieticians are proclaiming boldly 
that milk should be chewed, a mouthful at a time, if one would 
not have it change to curd about the diaphragm. The child's 
meat should be finely minced for him until he can cut it up for 
himself, and bolting be reckoned as a breach of decent behavior. 



THE CHILDREN 27 

He may forget the truism that "gentlemen eat slowly" after he 
joins in the great American rush for fortune. Obedience to it 
for a term of years will lay the foundation of sound digestion. 
He will have a better chance of long life and no dyspepsia, than 
if he had been allowed to gulp down milk by the glassful without 
drawing breath, and to gobble steaks and chops in two-inch 
chunks. 



DIET AND DIGESTION 

THE second depends upon the first. The two make up a whole 
which is Health. 

"Food values" is so emphatically a technical term that I would 
not employ it here if it did not express just what I mean, when 
used untechnically. 

What we eat has many and differing values. It is possible, 
without degenerating into dietetic cranks, to appraise them pro- 
perly and to apply the knowledge thus gained to the building up 
of these bodies of ours and the consequent up-building of the 
immortal better part they encase. 

Digestions are so many and so diverse, the one from the other, 
that it is rank folly to prescribe bills-of-fare warranted to agree 
with everybody. 

Take, for example, milk. It has won from the ablest writers 
on dietetics the title of the One Perfect Food for the human 
race. Specialists on dyspepsia prescribe an almost exclusive 
milk diet for obstinate cases. In typhoid fevers it is the specific 
regimen. One man consumes inordinate quantities, by advice, 
to increase adipose tissue. A woman lives upon skim milk, swal- 
lowed very slowly, to reduce her flesh. And so on through multi- 
farious cases all acting upon the recommendation of experts. 

All the time, as each of us knows, certain stomachs can not 
digest milk, or even retain it long enough to test its nutritive 
properties, while in others it causes intense heartburn and en- 
genders bile. 

Toast and tea are the stock invalid diet, the civilized world 
over. Yet Medical Daniels (M. D.'s) are rising up by the score 
to protest against ruining stomachs with tannic acid and bur- 
dening digestive organs by forcing what is no better than dry 
sawdust upon them.

DIET AND DIGESTION 29 

Chocolate is freely prescribed as digestible, and so nutritious 
that one could live and not lose flesh, eating nothing else, for 
weeks together. 

I am acquainted personally with ten people at least, to whom 
any form of chocolate is poisonous and abhorrent to every sense. 

Natives of the land where the cocoa palm grows virtually sub- 
sist upon the nuts, and many in other lands devour the imported 
cocoanut with impunity. The fatty flesh acts upon some stom- 
achs with the virulence of glass filings, producing terrible cramps 
and even convulsions. 

A noted teacher of culinary lore strenuously recommends our 
native nuts, walnuts, filberts, hazelnuts, chestnuts, and so forth, 
raw, and cooked in various ways as a substitute for meat. The 
innovation is daring, and opposed to the conclusion based upon 
the observation and experience of scores of other writers, to the 
effect that nuts are hurtful to six people out of ten, the oils, and 
the cells which contain the oils, difficult of digestion by any save 
the strongest stomach. 

It is much the fashion with writers upon domestic economy 
to extol fish as more economical and more easily digested than 
flesh, besides being rich in the phosphates needed to repair the 
waste of brain force. * 

Some people who would scout the imputation of invalidism 
can not eat even fresh fish without experiencing symptoms not 
unlike ptomaine poisoning. I recall the case of one woman who 
was extremely fond of oysters, yet dared not touch them for fear 
of fatal consequences. I once saw her faint away an hour after 
she had eaten half a dozen. 

Who shall decide when dietists and individual digestions 
disagree so radically as is indicated by these and hundreds of 
other examples ? And by what standard of gastronomic morality 
shall we gage personal conduct in the government of appetite? 
Since man must eat to live, and an unimpaired digestion is wealth 
inestimable what shall we eat? 

Certain combinations of materials are manifestly iniquitous. 
Cooked fats, fried fats in particular; soggy bread, especially 
when fresh from the oven; hot cakes, ("sinkers"), viscid with 



30 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

griddle grease and swimming in butter ; tough doughnuts, reek- 
ing with lard ; leathery pie-crust ; underdone fish and rare pork 
and veal ; cabbage that has been cooked in but one water ; turnips 
that have been left in t;:e ground until they are stringy pith ; 
tough meats of all kinds that resist mastication ; unripe fruits 
none of these should ever enter human mouths, or be imposed 
upon the long-suffering digestive apparatus. 

The housemother who studies wisely the properties of the 
fare she puts before her family will adjust food- values to the 
several needs of those to whom she ministers. The child of weak 
intestines must have neither oatmeal, hominy, nor mush for his 
breakfast cereal. Rice, rightly cooked, thickened milk, well 
boiled, and arrowroot porridge, will heal irritation, and, as it 
were, tighten the tension of the machine. He may not indulge 
in the apple-sauce and cracked wheat which are better than laxa- 
tive drugs to his hale brother. 

A bilious girl should not drink milk unqualified by a dash of 
lime water, and never take coffee. Her languid, appetiteless 
mother will be refreshed in nerve, stimulated in brain, by a demi- 
tasse of strong coffee taken without cream after her dinner. It is 
doubtful whether or not creamed coffee is a wholesome beverage 
for any one. It is an established fact that the addition of cream 
works a chemical change, and for the worse, in that which, 
taken clear, is a valuable digestive agent. 

An important branch of the mother's profession is to acquaint 
herself with the stomachic idiosyncrasies of each member of 
her household. Certain compounds and some simples do not 
agree with one person, while others thrive upon them. To be 
cognizant of the peculiarities of each constitution is to be fore- 
warned of the danger of gastronomic experiments. Lay down as 
a positive law that it is wrong a sin against the body given by 
God to eat what one is sure will disagree with one. Tabulate 
for your own convenience a code of "kitchen physic." 

To wit, that Indian meal is laxative ; oatmeal, heating ; wheat- 
flour, binding ; that tea is slightly astringent, and coffee, creamed, 
a gentle aperient ; that sweets and rare beef engender gouty acid 
in those disposed to rheumatism and constitutional headache ; 



DIET AND DIGESTION 31 

that candies and other confectionery ferment into sharp acid in 
an empty stomach, and should, therefore, never be eaten unless as 
a dessert. The same is true of pickles. Except when eaten in 
combination with meats and other oily foods, they are actively 
unwholesome. The schoolgirl habit of champing' pickled cucum- 
bers and pickled limes, as a starving pauper might gnaw a crust, 
is pernicious and disgusting. The skins of raisins and grapes are 
indigestible. Figs are a well-known cathartic, a fact the house- 
mother should avail herself of where a doctor, if summoned, 
would prescribe a drug. It is always better to control digestive 
irregularities by diet than by medicines, each of which is a poison 
which cures one ill by creating another. 

Pears dispose one to constipation. Ripe peaches and ripe ap- 
ples regulate the bowels in a vast majority of cases; an orange, 
eaten at bed time, is a gentler agent than Rochelle salts, and does 
as good work. 

The veteran practitioner who insisted fifty years ago that "cup- 
board cures" were safer and surer than those wrought by materia 
medica was in advance of his age. The twentieth century is just 
growing up to his standard. 



THE IMPROMPTU LARDER 

SOME of her friends call it "The Emergency Pantry." The 
owner objects to the term because it conveys an idea of bandages 
and styptics. Whereas, the cozy closet devoted to the comfort 
of possible guests to be welcomed and fed, although unexpected 
contains substantial food and appetizing delicacies. 

She belongs to the great and growing host of suburbanites de- 
pendent upon peripatetic butcher and baker, and the nearest 
"general store." The keeper of the typical general store never 
orders so much as one jar of marmalade or a pound of fancy bis- 
cuits until the last is sold, and has never a twinge of mortification 
in saying : "Just out ! Expect new lot next week." 

So our hospitable housewife stocks and keeps filled her reserve 
shelves. 

John has a way of bringing home a chance guest to dinner 
when the notion strikes him, and Mrs. Notable's town 'friends 
have their way of happening to be in dear Mary's neighborhood 
about lunch time, and, having come all the way out from town, 
it is hardly worth while to go home when there are afternoon 
calls to be paid in the suburbs. When one of these calls chances 
to be upon Mrs. Notable, afternoon tea must be served. Mrs. 
Notable's daughters join theater and concert parties, going early 
into the city and coming out late and hungry. Iced lemonade, 
ginger ale, cake and sandwiches refresh them and their attend- 
ants in summer, and on winter nights something hot and savory 
from "mother's chafing dish." 

Back of all this stands mother's Impromptu Larder. One shelf 
holds the best brand of canned soups, chicken, tongue and boned 
ham; another sardines, anchovies in oil, anchovy paste and pate 
de foie gras, soused mackerel, and mackerel with tomato sauce. 

32 



THE IMPROMPTU LARDER 33 

Baked beans, plain, and baked beans with tomato sauce, have 
honorable place among potted foods; also dainty jars of fancy 
cheeses, ready for use at a second's notice, and bottles of grated 
Parmesan. Olives, including pimolas, stand in line with "pin- 
money pickles" and catsups. There is a brave array of home- 
made jellies, marmalades, brandied and pickled peaches; a case 
of imported ginger ale, bottles of domestic liqueurs, and glass 
cans of apple-sauce and tomatoes, put up in Mrs. Notable's own 
kitchen. A fair proportion of each kind of pickle and preserve 
is set aside for the Impromptu Larder and not touched for family 
consumption. 

Fancy biscuits of many sorts have several shelves for their own ; 
sweet and unsweetened cheese biscuits, sea-foams and snow- 
flakes and zwieback; hard crackers and soft crackers; plain 
wafers, fruit wafers and cream wafers; lady-fingers and ginger- 
snaps make a goodly show to the eye and stay the mistress's 
surprised soul when the impromptu luncheon or supper must be 
more sudden and abundant than usual. 

"My strong tower !" she once called this pantry, laughingly. 

In winter she finds room for nuts, raisins, apples and oranges ; 
in autumn, for baskets of grapes. These last named may be 
called "transients," the supply being renewed frequently. 

Mrs. Notable is not a rich woman. She is obliged to make each 
dollar do the full work of one hundred cents. To this end she 
keeps an "expense book," setting down every article purchased 
and the cost thereof. 

In the account of necessary outlays that for replenishing the 
stores in the strong tower is registered under the head of "HOS- 



FAMILIAR TALK 

BREAKFAST 

COMMON sense would decide that we should begin the day with 
the glad alertness with which the sun smiles at us over horizon, 
or housetops. He rejoices as a strong man ready that is, rubbed 
down, supple and light to run a race. 

There are still writers of "goody" books and works on hygiene 
who extol the morning mood. According to them, the whole hu- 
man machine is then at its best. The head is clear, the stomach 
is vigorous, the spirits are buoyant, life is a joy. 

In reality the reality of the every-day life of respectable people 
who have not tarried long at the wine, or eaten Welsh rarebits 
over night the hard pull of the day is at the beginning. 

The head of the average man or woman ought to be clear, the 
digestive organs active, limbs and joints in excellent working 
order. There should not be what one comedian describes as a 
"dark-brown, fuzzy taste" in the mouth, or the feeling that the 
cranium is stuffed with cotton wool, and the diaphragm should 
not loathe all manner of food. 

But such things are. Where one man tells you that breakfast 
is the best meal of the day, fifty account the ceremony of the 
earliest meal of each new day as a hollow mockery. A celebrated 
judge left upon record the saying: "No man should be hanged 
for a murder committed before breakfast." Another, almost as 
famous, openly and officially declared his unwillingness to con- 
demn a prisoner convicted of manslaughter of whom his physi- 
cian had testified that he was a chronic dyspeptic. "A dyspeptic," 
urged the judge, whose own diet had consisted of mush and milk 
for ten years, "is never quite sane." 

Not one of his three daily meals is "comfortable" to him whose 

34 



FAMILIAR TALK 35 

alimentary apparatus is out of order. To one in tolerable health 
the business of "stoking" the engine for the drive of the forenoon 
should not be irksome. 

Thus common sense and hygienic general principles. Now for 
facts. 

A brilliant woman summed up the popular judgment on the 
subject in an after-luncheon speech before other literary women, 
in the assertion that "the human machine needs to be wound up 
and lubricated and regulated by bath and breakfast before it is 
fit to work with other machines, or, indeed, to go at all. Break- 
fast, partaken of in the company of one's nearest and dearest, is a 
blunder of modern civilization. It is an ordeal over which each 
should mourn apart." 

A young man of education and breeding, who lives in bacheloi 
chambers with three other "good fellows," confesses that, while 
the seven o'clock dinner hour is always full of cheer and good- 
will, the four friends seldom exchange a syllable at the breakfast 
table beyond a brief salutation at entering the room, and a curt 
"good day," in separating to their various places of business. 

"Thanks to this sensible silence, we have lived together three 
years without quarreling," he wound up the story by saying. 
"Every man is a brute until he has had his morning coffee." 

Much of this is talk for talk's sake, and some of it is Tem- 
per. It is not easy for one to get full command of oneself before 
the relaxed nerves are braced by tea or coffee, and the long-empty 
stomach is brought up to concert pitch by food. If we have slept 
too heavily, we are stupid: : f too little, irritable. 

I admit that the American's first meal of the crude day, with 
the accompaniment of the rush for car, or boat, or train, that 
turns out or in dyspeptics by the hundred thousand yearly, is 
not conducive to domestic happiness, or the preservation of table 
etiquette. The householder, devouring porridge, two cups of 
scalding coffee, rolls, steak and fried potatoes, at discretion, with 
one eye on the clock, and both feet braced for the jump and run 
he knows are imminent if he would catch the train, is in the first 
or fortieth stage of what a witty essayist diagnoses as "Ameri- 
canitis." His children's railroad speed of deglutition and the 



36 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

scurry for school are along the same lines of discomfort and dis- 
ease. 

Upon the mother's hands and head rests the responsibility of 
"getting them off for the day," a battle renewed with each morn- 
ing until she "fairly loathes the name and the thought of break- 
fast." 

The remedy for the domestic disgrace for it is nothing if not 
that is so simple that I have little hope it will be respected, much 
less accepted. 

It is, get up fifteen minutes earlier in the morning ! 

The plain truth is that your system is not "ready for break- 
fast," when you announce that you are. The racer, to whom 
Scripture compares the smiling God of Day, never takes the first 
lap at a rush. He warms gradually to his work, having at the 
outset paid as diligent heed to the "Make ready !" as to the "Go !" 

If you rise usually at seven, have the hot water and cleaned 
boots brought to the door at a quarter before seven, and get up 
when you are called. A brisk bath and a smart rubbing with a 
crash towel, preceded by fifty gymnastic strokes, such as arm- 
swinging and general flexing of the muscles ; twenty-five deep 
breaths that pump the morning air down to the bottomest well of 
your lungs and clear the respiratory passages of effete matter 
lodged there during the night these, with a general disposition 
to speak charitably toward, and to speak civilly to companions 
and competitors in the race, correspond to "make ready." Clean, 
supple, and in good heart, come to the table as to preliminary re- 
freshment you have time and appetite to enjoy. 

At least seven-tenths of the twaddle over the horrors of the 
family breakfast are affectation and indolence. Breakfasting in 
bed is an imported fashion, and to my notion, is not a clean 
practice. The tray brought to an unaired room, a tumbled bed 
and an unwashed body, looks well in French engravings, but is a 
solecism in an age of hygienic principles, much ventilation and 
matutinal baths. The inability to be in charity with one's fellow 
mortals, to smile genially and to speak gently before the world 
is well started upon its diurnal swing, and the complainant's 




BREAKFAST EQUIPAGE 



FAMILIAR TALK 37 

physical system is toned and tuned and oiled by eating, is degrad- 
ing in itself. The confession of it is puerile. 

Force yourself to speak pleasantly if you can not at once bring 
your spirits up to the right level. Study to be a man, or a woman, 
although breakfastless. To be thrown in the first round of the 
day by the sluggish flesh and the devil of ill-humor, before the 
world has a chance to grapple with you, is cowardly and sinful. 




BREAKFAST FRUITS 

THE imported fashion of beginning breakfast with fresh 
fruit has become an American custom. The assuasive effect of 
the generous juices upon the coat of the stomach, usually clogged 
at early morning with a mucous deposit, is a wholesome 
preparation for digestive processes a "toner" to just- 
awakened energies. To commit suddenly to the long- 
suffering stomach, as yet inert, and but dimly aware of 
what is expected of it, a "feed'* of beefsteak, potatoes and hot 
breads, is always an unwelcome surprise. Sometimes the abused 
organ turns with the proverbial blind wrath of the patient, and 
revenges itself, if not speedily, surely and fiercely. It would fain 
be awakened kindly and gently. To this end, stay it with oranges, 
comfort it with apples and grapes. 

Oranges 

1. Cut in half, crosswise, and dig out the pulp with a silver or 
gold orange spoon. 

2. They are yet nicer prepared beforehand by running a sharp 
knife on the inside, close to the rind, thus severing the membranes 
that divide the lobes. Take these membranes out carefully, leav- 
ing the pulp in the two cups of the halved orange. It can be 
then eaten as easily as a custard could be. Set on ice until you 
are ready to serve. 

3. Peel the oranges ; separate the lobes and cut each into three 
pieces. Serve in a chilled glass dish, passing powdered sugar 
for those who like it. 

Breakfast fruits are far more wholesome when eaten without 
sugar. 

38 



BREAKFAST FRUITS 39 

Grapes 

Keep them on ice for an hour before sending to table, even in 
winter, and scatter cracked ice over and among them. This has 
the double advantage of cooling and of cleansing them. Pass 
grape scissors with the dish of fruit. 



Peaches, pears and apples 






Wash and dry pears and apples with a soft cloth. Have a 
silver fruit knife at each plate, and let the eaters pare the fruit 
for themselves. Peaches should be left with the fur (and bloom) 
on. 

Berries 

These should never in any circumstances be sugared in the dish. 
Let each person sweeten his portion for himself, after which they 
should be eaten immediately, before the sugar has time to draw 
out the juice and thereby wither the berries. 

Strawberries should be eaten at breakfast with the caps on. 
Choose the finest fruit for this meal, using the stem as a handle, 
and dipping the berry into powdered sugar, if not sweet enough 
to be eaten without. 

Raspberries and blackberries 

Never wash these, or strawberries, unless they are intolerably 
gritty. Water is ruin to flavor and integrity, where the more 
delicate berries are concerned. Set on ice for an hour or more be- 
fore sending to table. Pass sugar for those who wish it, and in 
helping out each portion avoid bruising the berries. "Mashed" 
berries suffer an instant change in flavor. The air begins at once 
to act chemically upon the liberated juices. 

Huckleberries and gooseberries 

Wash, drain and leave on ice for two hours. Pass sugar with 
huckleberries for such as wish it. They are better without at 



40 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

breakfast. Gooseberries are always eaten without. The large 
English varieties are delicious and very healthful. 

If cream be eaten with breakfast fruit, it should be as an after- 
course or dessert. It loses character and effect as an assuasive 
and persuasive agent. 

Melons 

Cantelopes and nutmeg melons are prime favorites as an intro- 
ductory step to the weightier business of the morning meal. They 
deserve their popularity. 

Cut those of small and medium size in half; scrape out the 
seeds and put a lump of ice in each half. The larger may be di- 
vided into thirds, and a piece of ice laid upon each piece. Pass 
salt and pepper, also sugar with them. Many epicures prefer to 
eat them au nature I. 

Stewed fruits 

In the late winter or early spring-time, when apples are scarce 
and dear, and oranges have not yet come to their full plenteous- 
ness and flavor, the human system needs anti-bilious food. Our 
foremothers compounded a villainous preventive against spring 
"humors," of sulphur and molasses, stirred together to a cream 
and administered before breakfast to each shuddering creature 
who had pains in the bones, headache and nausea at rising, and a 
general sensation of good-for-nothingness. "Advanced" matrons 
added cream of tartar to the villainous preventive, and gave their 
families to drink of cream-of-tartar lemonade. According to 
these wise and worthy women, "spring fever" was as inseparable 
from the opening season as robin song and pussy willow. 

Even now, cooling medicines are advised by physicians and be- 
lieved in by families. The careful student of hygiene, a science 
the prime principle of which is prevention, and not cure, shows 
us a more excellent way. The kindly fruits of the earth never 
merit their name more truly than when winter is going and 
spring-time is coming ; when benevolent bile, balked in its rightful 
channels, becomes a baleful agency to be fought as an acknowl- 
edged foe. In fruit and in succulent vegetables we find our cool- 



BREAKFAST FRUITS 41 

ing medicines, "indicated" by the great physician, Nature. If 
fresh fruits be wanting, we must accept substitutes. 

Stewed rhubarb 

Wash, scrape and cut the stalks into inch lengths. Leave in 
cold water for an hour. Put over the fire in the inner vessel of 
a double boiler, set in cold water, bring to a boil and simmer 
gently until tender and clear. Keep the inner vessel closely cov- 
ered that the steam may do its work. Remove from the fire, 
sweeten to taste not heavily turn into a bowl and cover until 
cold. 

As a breakfast dish, this is refreshing and most wholesome. 
Cooked as above, you get the benefit of the anti-bilious juices, 
undiluted by water. Set on ice for an hour before eating. Some 
add a handful of sultana raisins to the raw rhubarb. 

Prunes 

Wash and soak for two hours. Drain, put over the fire with 
just enough cold water to cover them, and cook tender. Turn 
out and cover until cold. Put on the ice for an hour before send- 
ing to the table. No sugar should be added to prunes when they 
are to be eaten at breakfast time. 

They are slightly laxative and anti-bilious. 



BREAKFAST CEREALS 

SOME dietetists, who are neither cranks nor simpletons, disbe- 
lieve in cereals of whatsoever sort as a first course at breakfast. 
They urge that to spread a hot poultice all over the lining of the 
stomach is to relax and weaken that organ ; that it goes to sleep, 
as it were, and is too inert to dispose properly of the rest of the 
meal. 

Others are strenuous in the belief that the act of chewing is 
necessary to the proper assimilation of even semi-solids, and 
since few people think of chewing porridge, the value of it as 
nutriment is doubtful. 

There is force in the latter demur. Children should be taught 
to chew porridge of all kinds, also bread and milk. One zealous 
dietist insists that milk "the one and only perfect food"- 
ought to be masticated. The motion of the jaws excites the sali- 
vary glands, he says, causing the flow of a secretion most favor- 
able to digestion. 

As to the "hot poultice," there is a grain of reason in the ob- 
jection. As I have explained in urging the propriety of begin- 
ning breakfast with fruit, the coat of the stomach is masked, 
after the sleep of the night, by a thin mucus, which interferes 
with the task of the digestive agencies. If fruit is not eaten, a 
draft of cold water, not iced, will do the work in part. A few 
swallows of really hot water are better still. A sip of tea or 
coffee or, perhaps, best of all, vichy, apollinaris or other good 
mineral water, may precede the nourishing cereal. 

That it is nourishing when the stomach gets hold of it, is un- 
deniable. Oatmeal builds up bone, and muscle, and brain ; Indian 
meal mush and hominy are gently laxative and cooling to the 
blood ; preparations of wheat are less laxative, and therefore 

42 



BREAKFAST CEREALS 43 

safer in hot weather, and for teething children, than oatmeal in any 
form. Rice boiled tender in milk is both palatable and wholesome. 
Each and all of these should be eaten with cream, and except 
as a dessert, never with sugar. Children who are trained to eat 
porridge and milk, or cream, without sugar, find the addition of 
this unpleasant. It certainly tends to acidity of the stomach. 

Every cereal, with the exception of rice, that needs any cooking 
needs a great deal of it. Soaking over night is indispensable to 
the excellence of most of them. Four hours of boiling make oat- 
meal good ; eight hours make it better ; twenty-four hours make 
it "best." 

Oatmeal 

Soak over night. Even the varieties which are advertised "to 
require no soaking, and but fifteen minutes' cooking," are im- 
proved by this process. Turn a deaf ear to the charmer who 
would persuade you to the contrary. "Steam cooked'' is often a 
delusion and a snare. Put your oatmeal into the inner vessel 
of your farina kettle, cover deep in cold water, put on the lid and 
set at the back of the range at bedtime. In the morning add boil- 
ing water, salt to taste, and draw to the front, filling the outer ket- 
tle with hot water. Cook steadily for an hour and as much longer 
as you can. My own taste is for oatmeal boiled to a jelly. It is 
as far superior to the ordinary preparation of the cereal as 
creamed cauliflower is to Dutch cabbage. 

Send to table and eat with cream. 

Never throw away oatmeal "left-overs." Cook again, and yet 
again, always in a double boiler. 

Hominy 

Soak all night ; cover with boiling water, slightly salted, in the 
morning, and cook for an hour. A delicious preparation of hominy 
is effected by cooking it in plenty of salted water until tender, 
turning off the water and supplying its place with cold milk. 
Bring to a boil and serve. 



44 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Cracked wheat 
Cook as you would oatmeal. An hour's boiling suffices. 

Milk porridge 

Heat a pint of milk to boiling. Into a pint of cold milk stir 
four tablespoonfuls of flour, and when this is smooth stir it into 
the hot milk. Cook in a double boiler for an hour, add salt to taste, 
and serve with cream. 

Meal-and-flour porridge 

Mix together two tablespoonfuls of Indian meal and the same 
quantity of flour, wet them with cold water, and stir into a cup of 
boiling water. Cook in a double boiler for half an hour, stirring 
often. Add salt, and beat in slowly a pint of scalding milk, cook, 
stirring* constantly for fifteen minutes longer. Serve with cream. 

Brewis (as made by our grandmothers) 

Dry bread in the oven and crush with the rolling-pin into 
crumbs. Heat two cups of slightly salted milk, and when it boils, 
stir in a cupful of the dried crumbs. Add a tablespoonful of 
butter, and cook, beating steadily for five minutes. Serve hot 
with cream, or an abundance of sweet milk. 

Rice 

Wash a cupful of rice in two waters, then drop it slowly into 
two quarts of salted boiling water. The water should be at a 
galloping boil. Do not stir the rice once during the twenty min- 
utes in which it must cook steadily. At the end of that time test 
a grain to see if it is tender, and if it is, turn the rice into a 
colander ; shake this hard that the air may reach all the kernels, 
and set in the open oven five minutes before dishing. Each 
grain should stand separate from the rest. 



BREAKFAST CEREALS 45 

This is the South Carolinian way of cooking rice, and the one 
and only right way. 

Indian meal mush 

Moisten a cupful of corn-meal with enough cold water to make 
it into a paste. Stir this paste into a quart of salted, boiling 
water, and cook, beating it hard and often, for an hour at least. 
If the mush becomes too stiff, add from time to time more 
boiling water. 

Farina 

A good, inexpensive cereal, which seldom appears upon the 
breakfast table. Yet it should have honorable mention. 

Soak overnight. In the morning, stir it into boiling water, 
slightly salted, and cook half an hour, stirring up well from the 
bottom. 

Each patented breakfast cereal has its champion. It would be 
invidious to name any of them here. Nearly all are founded 
upon wheat, corn, rye, barley or rice. Each is accompanied by 
full directions for the preparation of the same for the table. 



BREAKFAST BREADS 

Beginning with the most important and difficult form of 
bread-making, I offer three methods of preparing and baking the 
wholesome home-made loaf, fondly recollected by those whose 
early lives were spent in regions where bakers' sawdusty cubes 
and parallelograms were not delivered at the back door in lieu 
of the genuine staff of life. 

Potato sponge bread (No. 1) 

Boil and mash, while hot, four potatoes of fair size, beating 
into them a tablespoonful, each, of cottolene or other fat and of 
white sugar. Beat smooth, adding, gradually, one and one-half 
pints of lukewarm water. Strain through a colander upon a 
pint of sifted flour. When you have a lumpless batter, add 
half a cake of compressed yeast, dissolved in four tablespoonfuls 
of warm water. 

This is your sponge. Set in a moderately warm place in a 
bread-bowl with a perforated cover. If you have not this cover, 
throw a double fold of mosquito net or cheese-cloth over the bowl. 

In four hours in summer, and six in winter, the sponge should 
be light and the top broken by air bubbles. Have ready in an- 
other deep bowl or tray five pints of dried flour of the best qual- 
ity, sifted with a tablespoonful of salt. Hollow a space in the 
middle and work the sponge gradually into the flour with a 
clean, cool, bare hand, well floured to hinder the dough from 
sticking to it. 

The dough should be just stiff enough to handle. When you 
can lift it to the kneading-board without spilling, it is ready. 
Rinse the bowl out with a little warm water and work into the 
dough in order to get all the sponge. Flour the board and 



BREAKFAST BREADS 47 

knead the ball of dough, always working from the outside of the 
Dall toward the middle. After ten minutes' hard work, turning 
the dough over and over and around and around, the dough 
should be so elastic that if you deal it a smart blow with your 
fist the indentation will fill up again instantly. 

Return to the mixing bowl, cover and leave as before, out of 
drafts in a steady temperature. When it has risen to double 
the original bulk in four or six hours return to the board and 
knead again, quickly and vigorously, for eight or ten minutes. 
Make into loaves and set to rise in pans, filling each half-full. 
Cover with a cloth, let all rise for an hour, or until the pans are 
two-thirds full, and bake. 

Have a steady fire, with coal enough to last until the baking is 
over. See that the ovens are a just right" by holding your naked 
arm in one. If you can hold it there comfortably for one whole 
minute and not more, you may put in the bread. Or try the 
oven with a little flour put upon a tin plate and set well back in 
the closed oven. It should be delicately touched with brown in 
five minutes if the oven be right. 

In ten minutes open the oven door very cautiously, and if you 
see the pans filled to the top, cover with light-brown "grocer's 
paper" to prevent the crust from hardening before the heart of 
the loaf is done. Ten minutes before the hour for baking is up 
remove the papers and let the top crust brown. 

Turn out the loaves carefully upon a cloth, propping them 
against a pan or other clean object, that they may not get sodden 
in cooling. Do not put into the bread-box until they are entirely 
cold. The box should have a cloth in the bottom, and another 
thrown over the bread before the box is closed. 

Bread with plain sponge (No. 2) 

Chop a tablespoonful of cottolene or other fat, or butter, into a 
quart of flour; wet with a quart of warm water; add a table- 
spoonful of sugar, and half a yeast-cake dissolved in warm water. 
Beat all together hard for ten minutes, as you would cake batter. 
Cover, and set aside to rise as with potato sponge. In the morn- 



48 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ing work into two quarts of salted flour and proceed as directed 
in last recipe. 

Milk bread (No. 1) 

Sift two quarts of flour with a tablespoonful of sugar and an 
even teaspoonful of salt. Have ready a pint of boiling water 
into which you have stirred an even tablespoonful of butter. 
Add, while the water is boiling, two cups of milk, and take from 
the fire at once. When a little more than blood-warm, stir into 
the milk-and-water half a cake of compressed yeast, dissolved 
in half a cupful of warm water. Make a hole in the sifted flour, 
pour in the mixture and work quickly with a wooden spoon to 
a soft dough. Flour your hands, make the dough into a man- 
ageable ball and knead hard and steadily for ten minutes. Let 
the dough rise to double the original bulk in your covered bread- 
bowl, make into loaves when you have kneaded it for five min- 
utes, and proceed as already directed. 

Milk bread (No. 2) 

Sift two quarts of flour into a large bowl and stir into it a 
teaspoonful, each, of salt and sugar. Into this flour stir a pint 
of warm milk, to which has been added a scant tablespoonful of 
melted butter, a pint of warm water, and half a yeast cake dis- 
solved in a gill of blood-warm water. Work to a dough ; turn 
upon a floured pastry-board and knead for fifteen minutes. Put 
the dough in the bread-raiser and set to rise over night. Early 
in the morning divide into loaves, knead each for five minutes, 
put the loaves into greased pans and set in a warm place to rise 
for an hour before baking in a steady oven. Cover the bread 
for the first half -hour it is in the oven. It should be baked in 
an hour. 

Whole wheat bread (No. 1) 

Dissolve a cake of yeast in half a cupful of warm water. Pour 
two cups of boiling water upon two cups of milk, and stir into 



BREAKFAST BREADS 49 

them a teaspoonful, each, of salt and sugar. When they are 
about blood-warm add the yeast. Into this stir a quart of whole 
wheat flour. Of course, flour varies in its thickening powers, 
but there should be enough to make a good batter. Beat hard 
for five minutes, then stir in more flour until you have a dough 
that is as soft as it can be handled. Knead for ten minutes on 
a floured board and set to rise for three hours. Knead again 
for five minutes ; make into loaves and let these rise. When 
light, bake. If the loaves are small they will bake in three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Whole wheat bread (No. 2) 

One tablespoonful of cottolene or other fat and the same of 
sugar. One cup, each, of boiling water and of hot (not boiling) 
milk. One yeast-cake dissolved in half a cup of warm water. 
One cup of white flour and three cups of whole wheat flour, or 
enough to make a soft dough. Knead for ten minutes ; cover 
and let it rise until it is twice its original bulk. Make into small 
loaves ; let it rise for an hour, or until very puffy, and bake. 

Graham bread (No. 1) 

Set a sponge over night, as for white bread, and in the morn- 
ing work into it a cup of salted whole wheat flour, three cups of 
graham flour and three tablespoonfuls of molasses. Knead long 
and hard, and set to rise. When very light make into loaves 
and set in a warm place for an hour longer. Bake in an even 
oven. The loaves should be covered with thick wrapping-paper 
during the first half-hour they are in the oven, then allowed to 
brown. This bread is especially nice when made with a potato 
sponge, keeping fresh and sweet much longer than when the 
plain sponge is used. 

Graham bread (No. 2) 

Make a sponge as for white bread, over night, and in the 
morning add to it three scant tablespoonfuls of molasses and 
4 



50 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

enough graham flour to make a soft dough. Knead thoroughly, 
and after forming into loaves and putting these into well-greased 
pans, set them to rise. When risen, bake in a tolerably hot oven. 

Old-fashioned rye bread 

Dissolve half a cake of yeast in a quarter-cup of lukewarm 
milk, with a small teaspoonful of white sugar. Pour this into 
a wooden bowl, add a pint of lukewarm water, a heaping tea- 
spoonful, each, of salt and caraway seed, and a pint of rye flour. 
Stir well with a wooden spoon and set to rise in a warm place for 
two hours. When sufficiently risen it will be full of bubbles. 
Add then flour enough to make a very stiff dough. Beat this for 
at least ten minutes and set to rise for two hours more. Knead 
on a floured board, let it rise in the pan again until it begins to 
crack. Dip your hand in cold water, wet the loaf and put it into 
the oven. It must bake one hour. Do not open the door for ten 
minutes after it goes in. The oven should be very hot at first, 
and as soon as the bread is browned it should be covered with 
stout paper. 

If you like, you may omit the caraway seeds. Some people 
dislike them exceedingly. Others would not relish rye bread 
"all of ye olden time" without them. 

Eye and Indian bread 

Make a soft, sponge of potatoes, or a plain sponge. (See 
Bread No. 2.) When light, sift together two cupfuls of rye 
flour with one of Indian meal, a teaspoonful of salt, an even 
teaspoonful of soda. Make a hole in the middle, pour in the 
sponge, and when the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated 
beat in half a cupful of molasses. Should the molasses thin the 
dough into a batter, add rye flour. Knead until it is as light as 
a rubber ball, set aside in a covered bread-bowl and let it rise 
six hours. Work ten minutes more, make into loaves, and when 
they are well up in the world bake in a slow oven. The loaves 



BREAKFAST BREADS 51 

will require three hours to bake properly. Cover with paper for 
the first two hours. 

The dear old grandaunt from whom I got this ancient and 
honorable recipe had baked her "rye and Indian" for fifty years 
in the brick oven of a homestead two hundred years old. She 
covered her loaves with leaves from an oak near the door. The 
oak overshadowed a well dug in 1640. 

Steamed Boston brown bread 

Mix thoroughly a cup, each, of graham flour, wheat flour and 
corn-meal, and stir in a teaspoonful of salt. Warm together a 
cup of milk, in which is dissolved a small teaspoonful of baking 
soda, and a teacup ful of molasses. Pour over the mixed flours 
and meal a cupful of boiling water, and then add the warmed 
milk and molasses. Beat hard and long, and turn into a greased 
pudding-mold with a closely-fitting top. Cook in an outer vessel 
of boiling water for three hours. Remove from the water, take 
the cover from the mold and set in the oven for ten or fifteen 
minutes, or until the bread is dry about the edges. Turn out, 
wrap in a napkin, and send to the table. 

''Salt-rising" bread (No. 1) 

(An old Virginia recipe) 

Dissolve a half-teaspoonful of salt in two cups of scalding 
water, and beat in gradually enough flour to make a very soft 
dough. Beat for ten minutes, cover and set in a very warm 
place for eight hours. Now stir a teaspoonful of salt into a pint 
of lukewarm milk and add enough flour to make a stiff batter 
before working it into the risen dough. Mix thoroughly, cover, 
and set again in a warm place to rise until very light. Turn into 
a wooden bowl and knead in enough flour to make the batter of 
the consistency of ordinary bread dough. Make into loaves and 
set these to rise, and, when light, bake. 



52 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

"Salt-rising" bread (No. 2) 

(Contributed) 

Put a quart of warm water, not scalding hot, but at blood- 
heat, into a pitcher, deep and of narrow mouth. Beat into it 
one teaspoonful of sugar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a lump of 
soda not larger than a pea and (not necessarily, but preferably) 
a tablespoonful of corn-meal, with enough flour to make a rather 
thick, but not really stiff, batter. Set your pitcher, well covered, 
into a stone jar or other deep vessel, and surround it with blood- 
warm water, setting it where such temperature will be quite 
evenly maintained. Never allow it to reach scalding heat. In 
two and a half hours, or, at the very most, three and a half, you 
will have foaming yeast. Now take a pan of flour, make a hole 
in the center, pour in the foaming yeast with as much water, 
gradually mixed with the yeast and flour, as will make the num- 
ber of loaves desired. Do not make the dough very stiff. It 
should quake visibly when the pan is shaken. Cover well with 
dry flour and clean cloths, set in a warm place (temperature 80 
degrees or 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or thereabouts), and, as soon 
as light, knead into loaves, which will soon rise enough for baking. 
Do not delay baking after the last rising, or your bread may have 
a slightly sour taste. Bake thoroughly, and no better or more 
wholesome fermented bread could be asked for. 

Sweet potato bread 

Dissolve one cake of compressed yeast in one-fourth cup of 
lukewarm water, add one cup of scalded milk (blood- warm), one 
tablespoonful of salt, one-half cup of sugar and one full cup of 
sweet potato, roasted, scraped from the skins, worked to a cream 
with three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, then allowed to cool. 
Beat all together until light, and stir in with a wooden spoon 
flour to make a soft dough. Throw a cloth over the bread- 
bowl and set in a warm place until well risen. Make into small 
loaves ; let them rise for an hour, and bake in a brisk oven. 

This is also a Virginia recipe. You may substitute Irish for 
sweet potatoes if you like. 



BREAKFAST BREADS 53 

Buttermilk bread 

Into a chopping-bowl put a quart of flour which has been sifted 
three times with half a teaspoonful of baking powder, the 
same quantity of baking soda, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
salt. Chop into this flour a heaping tablespoonful of butter until 
the shortening is thoroughly incorporated. Work in gradually 
a pint of buttermilk or enough to make a soft bread dough. 
Turn into a greased bread tin and bake in a steady oven for an 
hour. Cover with paper for the first half-hour, that the bread 
may have an opportunity to rise before the crust forms. Turn 
out and send to the table while very hot. Cut with a sharp 
knife into slices, which must be generously buttered. While per- 
haps this bread is not to be recommended to people who suffer 
from weak digestions, it will be liked by those whose gastric 
apparatus is in proper working order. 

If you can not get buttermilk, loppered milk will do as well. 

German coffee bread 

Heat a cup of milk to scalding, but do not let it boil. Stir into 
it while hot two tablespoonfuls of cottolene (never lard), or 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a little salt. Let it 
cool to blood-warmth, when add half a yeast-cake dissolved 
in one-quarter cup of blood-warm milk, and flour to make a 
stiff batter. Cover, and let rise until light. Add one-half cup 
of seeded raisins, cut into pieces. Spread one-half inch thick 
in a buttered dripping-pan; cover and let rise. Brush with 
melted butter, and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Bake in 
a moderate oven for half an hour. Cover for half of that time 
with thick paper. 

Graham bread without yeast 

To three and one-half cups of graham flour add two cups of 
sour milk, one cup of New Orleans molasses, a pinch of salt and 
one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water. Bake in a slow 
oven one hour.

HOT BREAKFAST BREADS 

Hot breads comprising griddle-cakes, biscuits, muffins, Sally 
Lunns and crumpets may not be wholesome for everybody. I 
seriously incline to the belief that they are not, especially in 
warm weather, and if partaken of too freely. 

But the best types of these are good, and their appearance upon 
the board where John had looked for stale bread, or charred 
toast, is a means of breakfast grace not to be underrated by the 
wise housewife. She is a canny woman who runs down into the 
kitchen for ten or fifteen minutes on a stormy morning, or when 
the bread is especially dry, or John is "a wee bit blue," and tosses 
up (always by rule and measure) ingredients that come out of 
a quick oven, puffy, hot, delicious, to gladden the boys' hearts 
and give their father pleasanter food for consideration than busi- 
ness worries. If the men of any family were called upon for 
their opinion of what a dietetic crank, better versed in anatomy 
and chemistry than in courtesy, once anathematized at my break- 
fast table as "rank poison, madam ! and nothing short of a sin !" 
they would say of his tabooed hot breads "Naughty ! but nice !" 

One John who hankers for the buckwheat cakes and sausage 
of his boyhood as the wanderers in the wilderness, their souls 
a-weary of manna, lusted for Egyptian flesh-pots maintains, 
upon fairly tenable hygienic principles, that warm bread is made 
unwholesome because it is not masticated properly. 

"We chew stale bread," he says. "We bolt griddle-cakes and 
muffins because they are soft and easily swallowed. Give 'the 
salivary glands a chance to act upon them and they will not 
harm you." 

The prescription is easily tried. 

Breakfast rolls (No. 1) 

Sift a quart of flour with a half-teaspoonful of salt and a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, rub into it a tablespoonful of butter, add a 
cup of warm milk and a third of a yeast-cake that has been dis- 



BREAKFAST BREADS 55 

solved in three tablespoonfuls of warm water, and knead this 
dough for twenty minutes. Set to rise for six or eight hours, 
make into rolls, put these into a greased baking;-pan, and let 
them rise for half an hour longer before baking. 

Breakfast rolls (No. 2) 

Sift a quart of flour and stir into it a saltspoonful of salt, a 
teaspoonful of sugar, a cup of warm milk, two tablespoonfuls 
of melted cottolene or other fat, and two beaten eggs. Dissolve 
a quarter of a cake of compressed yeast in a little warm milk 
and beat in last of all. Set the dough in a bowl to rise until 
morning. Early in the morning make quickly and lightly into 
rolls, and set to rise near the range for twenty minutes. Bake 
for about an hour. 

Parker house rolls 

One cup of scalded milk (not boiled) left to cool until a little 
more than blood-warm, one-half yeast-cake dissolved in four 
tablespoonfuls of warm water, one tablespoonful of butter, three 
cups of flour, or a little less, one even tablespoonful of sugar, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt. 

Melt the butter in the milk, add salt, sugar and yeast with 
rather less than half the flour. Make a sponge of these ingredi- 
ents, beat hard for five minutes and set in a warm, sheltered 
place to rise. 

It should be quite light in an hour and a half in winter, an 
hour in summer. Work in the rest of the flour until you have 
a soft dough. Knead three minutes and set to rise with a folded 
cloth over the bowl to exclude the air. When it has doubled its 
original bulk, turn out upon your kneading-board, and work 
quickly, but lightly, with fingers, not fists, for one minute. Roll 
with quick strokes and few into a thick sheet, rub over with 
melted butter (not hot). Roll up and knead one minute longer 
to incorporate the butter. Pull off bits of the dough three times 
as large as a walnut, and roll on the board into the desired shape. 
Arrange close together in the baking-pan. Cover and let them 



56 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

rise for half an hour, again doubling their size; then bake in a 
brisk, steady oven. Twenty minutes should suffice. When they 
have been in five minutes cover with whitey-brown grocer's 
paper. Five minutes before the time is up take this off and 
brown. 

Vienna rolls 

Set a plain bread sponge at six o'clock in the evening. At 
bedtime make out a dough as directed for home-made bread. 
Cover in your mixing-bowl and set in a moderately warm place 
until six o'clock next morning. Make into round rolls as large 
as a small egg ; set in a floured baking-pan so far apart that they 
will not touch as they rise; cover and leave for an hour. Just 
before they go into the oven cut half through the middle of each 
with a floured, sharp knife. Bake in a moderate oven to form a 
good crust. Cover at the end of ten minutes with paper. Re- 
move this fifteen minutes later and brown. 



Raised apple biscuits 

(An old Virginia recipe) 

One cup of scalded milk left to become blood-warm; one 
tablespoonful of butter melted in the milk ; one tablespoonful of 
sugar; one-half teaspoonful of salt; one-half teaspoonful of 
baking-soda; one-half cake compressed yeast, dissolved in warm 
water; one cupful of grated apple; enough flour for making 
soft dough. 

Mix the sugar with the butter and milk, and add the yeast. 
Sift salt twice with a cupful of flour. Make a hole in the middle 
and pour in the liquid. Beat into a batter and let it rise four 
hours. When light, sift the soda twice with another cupful of 
flour ; grate the just-pared apple into the batter and beat in before 
it can change color. Finally, work in the sifted flour and soda. 
Let it rise for an hour, make into round, flat cakes with your 
hand; set close together in a pan, and when very light bake in 
a moderate oven. They are very good split open while hot, and 
buttered and sugared. 



BREAKFAST BREADS 57 

Sally Limn 

Sift together a pint of flour, a half-teaspoonful of salt and the 
same of powdered sugar. 

In a large bowl beat stiff two eggs, pour on them a half-cup 
of warm milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, melted, and a quar- 
ter of a tablespoonful of baking soda dissolved in a tablespoonful 
of hot water. Now slowly beat in the sifted flour and a quarter 
of a yeast-cake dissolved in half a cup of warm water. Whip 
to a smooth batter, and turn into a large greased mold to rise. 
In the morning set the mold in a steady oven and bake for half 
an hour, or until a straw pierced through the center of the loaf 
comes out clean. Turn out and serve at once. 



Dried rusk 

(An old Dutch family recipe) 

Mix together a pint of milk, four tablespoonfuls of melted but- 
ter, a teaspoonful of salt and a half-cake of yeast dissolved in a 
half-cup of lukewarm water. Add enough flour to make a thick 
batter, beat it in well, cover the bowl containing this, and set in 
a warm place for two hours. Now work in the beaten eggs, and, 
when these are incorporated, add enough flour to make a dough 
that can easily be rolled out. Set to rise for two hours longer, 
then turn upon a floured board, roll out and cut into round bis- 
cuits. Lay in a baking-pan and set these near the range to rise 
for half an hour. Bake, and when done leave in the open oven 
to dry out. See that the fire is so low that the rusk will dry, not 
brown or burn. If you can spare the oven so long leave the rusk 
in it for six or eight hours ; then set in a dry closet for several 
days before using. When you wish to use them lay in a deep 
bowl, pour iced milk upon them and let them soak until soft. 
Serve very cold with butter. 

They are delicious for summer-morning breakfasts.

(Contributed) 

Sift two cupfuls of flour, two teaspoon fuls of baking-powder, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt thoroughly together and mix with 
two-thirds cup of milk. Roll to a quarter of an inch thickness. 
Brush over with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Mix to- 
gether one-third cupful of stoned raisins, chopped fine, two 
teaspoonfuls of citron, chopped fine, two teaspoonfuls of sugar 
and one-third teaspoonful of cinnamon. Spread this .mixture 
over the dough, roll up like a jelly roll, cut in pieces three- 
fourths of an inch in thickness, and bake in quick oven fifteen 
minutes. 

Hot cross buns 

(Contributed) 

To three cups of milk add flour enough to make a thick bat- 
ter. Into this stir one cake of compressed yeast dissolved in 
warm water. Set this to rise over night. In the morning add 
a few spoonfuls of melted butter and one-half spoonful of 
grated nutmeg, one saltspoon of salt, one teaspoonful of soda, 
and 'flour enough to make a stiff dough like biscuit. Knead well 
and let rise five hours. Roll to one-half inch thickness, cut in 
round cakes and put in buttered baking pans. Let stand until 
light. Make a deep gash in each with a knife. Bake in mod- 
erate oven till light brown. Brush over the top with the beaten 
white of an egg and powdered sugar. 

Currant buns 



Warm a cupful of cream in a double boiler, take it from the 
fire and stir into it a cupful of melted butter which has not been 
allowed to cook in melting. Beat three eggs very light, add 
them to the cream and butter, then stir in a cupful of sugar. 
Dissolve a half-cake of yeast in a couple of tablespoonfuls of 
water, sift a good quart of flour, make a hollow in it, stir into it 
the yeast and then, after adding to the other mixture 'a teaspoon-

ful, each, of powdered mace and cinnamon, put in the flour and 
yeast. Beat all well for a few minutes, add a cupful of currants 
that have been washed, dried and dredged with flour, pour into 
a shallow baking pan, let it rise for several hours until it has 
doubled in size, bake one hour in a rather quick oven. Sprinkle 
with fine sugar when done. 

Raised muffins 

In a quart of warm milk dissolve thoroughly half a yeast-cake. 
Stir into this two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, 
and a tablespoonful of melted cottolene or other fat. Add 
enough flour to make a quite stiff batter not dough and. set to 
rise over night. In the morning whip into the batter four well- 
beaten eggs and turn into heated and greased muffin-tins. Bake 
at once. 

English muffins 

Bring a pint of milk to the boiling point and stir into it a tea- 
spoonful of cottolene or other fat. Set aside until the mixture 
is lukewarm, then add two cups of flour into which a teaspoonful 
of salt has been sifted. Now beat in half a yeast-cake dissolved 
in a quarter of a cup of warm water, and set the batter aside to 
rise all night. In the morning add a cup of sifted flour, and with 
floured hands make lightly into round muffins and set to rise in 
greased muffin-tins for half an hour. Slip the rings and their 
contents on to a greased griddle and bake, first on one side, then 
on the other, until done. 

English crumpets (No. 1) 

f Mix together -three gills of lukewarm water, a half-teaspoon- 
ful, each, of salt and sugar and a teaspoonful of melted butter ; 
then dissolve a quarter of a yeast-cake in this mixture. Into 
this stir enough flour to make a very stiff batter. Beat for ten 
minutes, adding as you do so enough lukewarm milk to make 
batter just stiff enough to be poured slowly from the bowl. 



BREAKFAST BREADS 61 

Grease shallow muffin-rings, place these on a soapstone griddle, 
and when hot pour the batter into them to the depth of a quarter- 
inch and bake slowly, not turning until brown on the under side. 
Then turn for just a few minutes. 

English crumpets (No. 2) 

On baking-day take a pint of dough from your bread-bowl 
an hour before breakfast. Put into a bowl and make a hole in 
the middle. Have ready two eggs beaten very light, and work 
them into the dough. Then thin it with milk and water to the 
consistency of griddle-cakes ; beat it well, let it rise until break- 
fast, bake them on a hot griddle, butter and send to the table hot. 



QUICK BISCUITS, ETCETERA 

Milk biscuits 

One quart flour, three cups of milk, one tablespoonful mixed 
butter and cottolene or other fat, one heaping teaspoonful of 
baking-powder, half-teaspoonful of salt. Sift the salt with the 
flour, chop in the butter and cottolene or other fat, add the bak- 
ing-powder and the milk and mix to a soft dough. Handle as 
little as possible. Roll out into a sheet an inch .thick, cut into 
rounds and bake in a floured pan. 

Milk-and-water biscuits 

Make as in the preceding recipe, but using one and one-half 
cups of milk and the same quantity of water. Some housewives 
prefer these to the all-milk biscuits, alleging that the milk tends 
to make the dough heavy.

flour last, in' great handfuls, stirring all the time, as long as you 
can use a spoon. The dough should be very soft ; in fact, almost 
a batter. Bake in a mold with a funnel in the middle, and eat 
while hot. 

Potato biscuits 

Boil and mash six or eight potatoes. While warm, lay on a 
floured pastry-board, and run the rolling-pin over and over them 
until they are free from lumps. Turn into a bowl, wet with a 
cup of sweet milk, add a teaspoonful of melted butter ; when 
well mixed work in half a cup of salted flour, or just enough to 
make a soft dough. Return to the board, roll out quickly and 
lightly into a thin sheet, and cut into round cakes. Bake in a 
quick oven. Butter as soon as they are done, laying one on top 
of the other in a pile. Eat before they fall. 

The excellence of potato biscuits depends very greatly upon 
the softness of the dough, light handling, and quick baking. If 
properly made, they will be found extremely nice. They are a 
favorite Irish dish. 

Graham biscuits 

Stir together in a chopping-bowl a pint of graham flour and 
a half-pint of white flour. To this add a teaspoonful of salt, one 
of sugar, and two rounded teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Mix 
thoroughly, and chop into the mixture two tablespoonfuls of 
cottelene or other fat. Add a pint of milk, and if the mixture is 
then too stiff to handle, add enough water to make into a soft 
dough. Turn upon a floured board, roll out, and cut into biscuits, 
handling as little and as lightly as possible. Bake in a steady 
oven. 

Virginia beaten biscuits 

One pint of flour, one cup of water, one teaspoonful of salt. 
Mix into a stiff dough; transfer to a floured block of wood and 
beat with a rolling-pin, steadily, for ten minutes, shifting the 
dough often and turning it over several times. In the olden 



BREAKFAST BREADS 63 

days half an hour was the regulation time, but ten minutes are 
enough if one has a strict eye to business. Cut into round cakes, 
prick with a straw and bake in a brisk oven. 



MUFFINS AND THEIR CONGENERS 

Whole wheat muffins 

INTO a quart of whole wheat flour stir a teaspoonful of salt and 
two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Beat three eggs light and 
stir them into three cups of rich milk, Add these to the flour, 
stir in a tablespoonful of melted cottolene or other fat, and beat 
very hard for at least five minutes. Turn into greased muffin- 
tins and bake in a quick oven. 

Oatmeal muffins 

(Contributed) 

To one cup of oatmeal mush add one-half cup of milk, one 
well-beaten egg, one teaspoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of 
sugar and one cup of flour in which has been sifted two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking-powder. Stir well together and bake in hot 
muffin-pans. 

Sally's muffins 

One egg ; a tablespoonful of sugar ; one-quarter cup of butter. 
Beat all together thoroughly. Add one cup of milk, a little salt 
and one cup of flour into which is sifted two teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing-powder. Now add enough flour to make a batter a little 
stiffer than for griddle-cakes. Bake in well-buttered, hot muffin- 
tins. 

Risen brunette muffins 

Cream together two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar and one 
tablespoonful of butter and add to it three cups of warm (not 
hot) milk. Sift into a bowl three cups of graham flour and one 
of white, with a teaspoonful of salt. Pour into this the butter, 



64 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

sugar and milk mixture and add a cup of warm milk in which 
half a yeast-cake has been dissolved. Beat thoroughly and set 
in a warm place to rise for at least six hours. Butter muffin-tins, 
half fill with the mixture, and set on a stool by the range to rise 
for fifteen minutes before baking in a steady oven. 

Graham puffs 

Thoroughly beat the yolks of four eggs, and whip the whites to 
a stiff meringue. To the yolks add a pint of milk, a teaspoonful 
of salt, three teaspoonfuls of melted cottolene or other fat, and a 
tablespoonful of sugar. Sift two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder 
into a quart of graham flour and stir this gradually into the milk 
and yolks. Beat until all lumps are gone and you have a smooth 
batter, then, with a few strong strokes, add the stiffened whites 
of the eggs. Half fill deep heated muffin-tins with the batter and 
bake at once in a hot but steady oven. 

Graham gems (No. 1) 

Into a quart of warm milk stir four eggs that have been beaten 
only a little, add a tablespoonful, each, of melted butter and 
sugar. Add now, gradually, three cupfuls of graham flour that

tered pate, or gem pans, in a brisk oven. Serve at once. 



WAFFLES 

Risen waffles 

Four eggs; two cups of milk; three tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter ; one tablespoonful of sugar ; three cupfuls of flour, sifted 
with half a teaspoonful of salt ; one-half yeast-cake dissolved in 
warm water. Beat well and long; set in a warm place to rise 
and bake in waffle-irons. 

Rice waffles 

One cup of boiled rice ; one pint of sweet milk ; two eggs ; one 
teaspoonful of baking-powder ; one teaspoonful of salt ; a table- 
5 



66 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

spoonful of butter and flour to make a thin batter. Sift salt, 
baking-powder and one scant cup of flour twice together; add 
milk and eggs, beat in butter and rice. Beat two minutes. 

Quick waffles 

Two cups of flour sifted twice with one teaspoonful of baking- 
powder and the same of salt. Three eggs ; one tablespoonful of 
butter or cottolene or other fat. Two cupfuls of milk. 

Beat the yolks smooth, add the milk, and turn this upon the 
prepared flour. Whip lightly and quickly for one minute, add the 
stiffened whites and drop by the spoonful into heated and greased 
waffle-irons. 

GRIDDLE CAKES 

If you can get a soapstone griddle, use no other. Cakes are 
baked not fried upon it, and are thereby made comparatively 
wholesome. Set the griddle at the side of the range to heat grad- 
ually at least one hour before you begin to bake the cakes. If 
heated suddenly it is liable to crack. Clean with dry salt, then 
wipe with a clean cloth and it is ready for use. Never allow a 
drop of grease to touch it. 

"If you have an iron griddle, lubricate with a bit of salt pork, 
leaving just enough grease on the surface to prevent sticking. 
The popular prejudice against griddle-cakes is founded mainly 
upon the fact that dough or batter soaked in grease is abhorrent 
to dietetic ethics. 

Soapstone and iron griddles alike need tempering or seasoning 
in order to do their work well. They are seldom "just right" at 
the first trial. Give them time and handle them patiently. 

Buckwheat cakes (No. 1) 

Mix together a quart of buckwheat flour, four tablespoonfuls 
of yeast, a handful of Indian meal, two tablespoonfuls of New 
Orleans molasses, a teaspoonful of salt and enough water to make 



BREAKFAST BREADS 67 

a thin batter. Beat hard and set to rise in the warm kitchen. 
A pint of this may be left over in the morning after the baking 
of the cakes and used as a sponge the following night, the flour, 
etc., being added. If the batter seems sour, add a very little 
baking-soda. This batter may be kept in a stone crock for a week 
or longer. 

Buckwheat cakes (No. 2) 

One cup of milk and same of boiling water ; two tablespoonfuls 
of molasses ; half cake of compressed yeast dissolved in warm 
water ; one-half teaspoonf ul of salt ; two cups of buckwheat flour, 
or enough for a good batter. 

Beat five minutes, and set in a warm place to rise. In the 
morning beat hard for one minute ; if it be sour, add a little soda, 
and let it rise near the fire for half an hour before baking. 



Quick buckwheat cakes 

Two cups of buckwheat and half a cup of corn-meal ; two cups 
of warm milk and half a cup of warm water ; two tablespoonfuls 
of molasses, two teaspoonf uls of baking-powder; one even tea- 
spoonful of salt. 

Mix milk, water and molasses together. Sift meal and flour 
three times with the baking-powder and salt. Make a hole in 
the center of the flour, stir in the milk and water quickly and 
lightly until you have a good batter not too stiff and bake. 

Sour milk buckwheat cakes 

Make as in preceding recipe, substituting loppered milk or 
buttermilk for sweet, and a rounded teaspoonful of baking-soda 
for the baking-powder. 

Whole wheat griddle-cakes 

Sift a quart of whole wheat flour, a teaspoonful of baking- 
powder and one of salt well together. Stir into this a tablespoon- 



68 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ful of melted butter, a tablespoonful of sugar, two beaten eggs 
and two cupfuls of milk. Beat all together and bake upon a 
soapstone griddle. 

Lizzie's flannel cakes 

Two cups of flour ; two cups of sweet milk ; one egg ; one tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder; a generous pinch of salt. Beat the 
egg very light; add the milk and, lastly, with just enough beating 
to mix all together, the flour, sifted twice with salt and baking- 
powder. Bake at once. 

After several years trial of this simple recipe, I can recommend 
it unhesitatingly as the best, cheapest and most wholesome way 
I know for preparing breakfast cakes. The excellence of the 
cakes depends upon quick mixing and baking. A soapstone 
griddle, which is never greased, should be used. 

Waffles may be made in the same way mixed a little thinner by 
using less flour. 

Huckleberry griddle-cakes 

(Contributed) 

To one cup of milk add one-half teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder, one tablespoonful of sugar and two

strainer. Pour into this one cup of boiling milk. Add a tea- 
spoonful of butter and one of sugar and one of salt. When cold 
add one egg beaten till light and one cup of flour into which has 
been sifted three level teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Fry on a 
soapstone griddle. 

French pancakes 

To the yolks of three eggs add one cup of milk, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of sugar. Pour one-third 
of this mixture on one-half cup of flour and stir to a smooth 
paste ; then add the remainder of the mixture and beat well. To 
this add one-half teaspoonful of salad oil. Pour enough of the 
batter into a hot buttered frying-pan to cover the pan. When 
brown turn and brown the other side. Spread with butter and 
jelly, roll up and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Sour milk griddle-cakes 

> 

Into a quart of loppered milk stir a quart of flour, a teaspoonful 
of salt and two beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly, then add as much

tablespoonful of melted butter, then whipped light with the yolks 
of the eggs; two eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately; one 
cup of milk; one tablespoonful of flour sifted twice, with an 
even teaspoonful of baking-powder and a teaspoonful of salt; 
one tablespoonful of molasses. Stir molasses into the milk, add 
to the hominy, butter and yolks ; lastly, put in prepared flour and 
the whites of the eggs. 

Sweet corn griddle-cakes 

One cup of sweet corn fresh or, canned, chopped fine and run 
through a vegetable press ; one cup of hot milk ; one tablespoon- 
ful, each, of butter and sugar ; half teaspoonful of salt ; one cup 
of flour sifted twice with a rounded teaspoonful of baking-pow- 
der and a little salt ; two eggs. Mix as you would hominy cakes. 

Corn-meal and graham griddle-cakes 

Two cups of corn -meal and one cup of graham flour. The 
flour should be sifted three times with one even teaspoonful of 
baking-powder and a little salt. One quart of scalding milk. 
One tablespoonful of butter and the same of molasses, stirred to 
a cream. One even teaspoonful of salt. Two eggs whites and 
yolks beaten separately. 

Scald the meal with the milk, beat in butter and molasses and 
let it cool to blood warmth before adding the beaten yolks and 
the prepared flour alternately with the stiffened whites. If too 
stiff, thin with cold milk. Beat hard and bake. Wholesome and 
palatable if properly made. 



BREAKFAST BREADS 71

DIVERS KINDS OF TOAST 

Buttered toast 

CUT the crusts from thin slices of stale bread and toast them 
over a clear fire to a delicate brown ; spread lightly with butter 
and pile upon a hot plate ; keep in the open oven until sent to the 
table. 

German toast 

Pare the slices and cut into strips twice as wide as your middle 
finger and about as long. Toast quickly on both sides, butter 
lightly and serve very hot 

Baked milk toast 

Trim off the crust from slices nearly half an inch thick ; toast 
to a uniform light brown. Have on the range a pan of boiling 
water, salted. As you remove each slice from the toaster dip 
quickly into the boiling water and lay in a well-buttered pudding 
dish ; buttering the toast while smoking hot and salting each slice. 
When all the soaked toast is packed into place, cover with scald- 
ing milk in which has been melted a tablespoonful of butter. 
Cover closely and bake fifteen minutes. 

This is so far superior to the usual insipid preparation of mik 
toast that no one who has eaten the first can enjoy the poor 
parody. 



76 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Cream toast 

Toast, and proceed as in last recipe, but dipping each slice in 
hot salted milk instead of water, and when in the dish covering; 
with a mixture one-third milk, two-thirds cream, made very hot. 
Add a pinch of soda to the cream to prevent curdling. 

Cream toast, baked, is delicious and nutritious. Either of these 
dishes can be made of graham bread. 

Fried toast 

Cut rather thick slices of stale bread round with a cake cutter ; 
spread upon a platter and pour over them a mixture of one cup 
of milk with an egg beaten into it, then salted slightly. Turn 
the slices until saturated, drain carefully and fry as you would 
doughnuts in deep hot cottolene or other fat, turning when half 
done. Lay scrambled or poached eggs or a nice mince upon them 
for breakfast. 

Tomato toast 

Prepare precisely as directed in recipe for baked milk toast, 
but pour over the pile of slices in the dish a rich strained tomato 
sauce, lifting the toast with a fork, that the sauce may get at 
each piece. Cover and bake. Serve in the dish as an accompani- 
ment to chops, omelet or hash. 

Anchovy toast 

Cut stale bread into strips an inch and a half wide and three 
inches long; toast, butter and spread with anchovy paste, as a 
foundation for scrambled or poached eggs. 

Sardine toast 

(Contributed) 

Butter rounds of toast and set in the oven to brown. Drain 
the oil from a box of sardines and flake with a silver fork. Put 
into a saucepan one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoon ful of 
lemon juice and one-half teaspoonful of onion juice. Stir until 



BREAKFAST BREADS 77 

hot and then add the flaked sardines. Stir until the fish is hot. 
Spread on the hot rounds of bread and serve at once. 

Cheese custard toast 

(Contributed) 

Sprinkle hot toasted bread with grated cheese. Set in the 
oven until the cheese melts. Take out and arrange in layers in 
a pudding dish and pour over it an unsweetened custard. Put in 
a moderate oven until the custard is done. Serve at once. 

Oyster toast 

(Contributed) 

Put twelve oysters into a saucepan with their own liquor and 
one-quarter teaspoonful of white pepper, one glass of milk and 
two cloves. Boil for three minutes. Mix one ounce of butter 
with one-half ounce of flour ; put this in a pan and stir well. Add 
one teaspoonful of lemon juice and, when boiling, pour the mix- 
ture over the toast and serve. 

Mushroom toast 

(Contributed) 

Cut the stems of mushrooms fine and stew in a little milk. 
Slice, in quarters, the tops. Cook five minutes in plenty of butter. 
Then add cream enough to make a sauce ; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. Let the stems simmer until tender, adding some cream, 
if needed. There should be sauce enough to moisten the toast. 
Pour on toast and serve. 

Ham toast 

(Contributed) 

Mince the lean of two slices of cooked ham very finely. Beat 
the yolks of two eggs, mix with the ham, adding enough cream or 
stock to make it soft. Keep it on the fire long enough to warm 
through, stirring all the time. Have ready some buttered toast 
cut in rounds, Lay the ham mixture neatly on each piece. 



EGGS 

"THE following method of determining the age of eggs is prac- 
tised in the markets of Paris. About six ounces of common 
cooking salt is put into a large glass, which is then filled with 
water. When the salt is in solution an egg is dropped into the 
glass. If the egg is only one day old, it immediately sinks to 
the bottom ; if any older it does not reach the bottom of the glass. 
If three days old, it sinks only just below the surface. From 
five days upwards it floats ; the older it is the more it protrudes 
out -of the water." German Newspaper. 

Boiled eggs (No. 1) 

Be sure the water is at a rapid boil. Wash the eggs in 
warm water, leaving them in it just long enough to take off the 
chill. If you put them on to boil while cold you must allow 
twenty seconds for the shells to get warm. Boil steadily three 
minutes and a half, take out, wrap in a warmed napkin and send 
immediately to table. 

Boiled eggs (No. 2) 

Wash in warm water; lay in boiling water and remove the 
saucepan promptly from the fire to the side of the range where 
it will hold the heat, but can not possibly boil. Cover closely and 
leave thus for seven or eight minutes, according to the size of the 
eggs. It will be of a custard-like consistency all through, and be 
far more digestible than when the white is firm and the yolk soft. 

Poached eggs 

Add a little vinegar to the water in which you poach eggs, to 
prevent the whites from spreading. Breaking each one into a shal-

EGGS 



EGGS 79 

low cup about a quarter of an hour before it is to be cooked is 
also a good plan. 

Be sure the water is boiling and free from specks. If you have 
no egg-poacher, use a clean frying-pan. Fill with boiling water ; 
draw to the side of the range, slip the eggs, one by one, upon the 
surface, set carefully back over the fire and boil gently three min- 
utes, or until the whites are firm. Take up with a flat perforated 
spoon, lay upon rounds of buttered toast, trim off ragged edges 
and dust lightly with salt and white pepper. Celery salt gives a 
pleasant flavor to poached eggs, and some relish a drop of onion 
juice upon each. 

Eggs poached in milk 

Proceed as with those poached in water, using boiling milk in- 
stead. When done, transfer to slices of hot buttered toast laid 
upon a platter and pour over all a white sauce plain drawn but- 
ter, or butter drawn in stock of some kind. Chicken stock is 
particularly good for this. 

Scrambled eggs 

Have a tablespoonful of butter hissing hot in the frying-pan. 
Break six eggs into a bowl ; add, without breaking the eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of cream, or, if you have none, of milk in which 
half a teaspoonful of corn-starch has been wet ; add pepper, salt, 
and a little finely minced parsley ; turn all into the pan, and stir 
incessantly in all directions, until you have a creamy mass. 

Turn out upon buttered toast or into a hot water dish and 
serve before the mass hardens. 

Scrambled eggs in cups 

With a rather large tin "shape" cut round out of slices of stale 
bread an inch thick. With a small "shape" cut more than half 
through these rounds and dig out the crumb carefully, leaving 
bottom and sides a quarter of an inch thick. Set in a pan on the 
upper grating of the oven to crisp. When of a delicate brown, 



8o MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

butter the insides and edges of the "cups" and leave in the oven 
three minutes longer. Arrange on a dish and fill with scrambled 
eggs prepared as in the last recipe. 

Fried eggs 

Fry 'slices of bacon quickly, take out the meat and keep it hot ; 
strain the fat that ran from them, add a tablespoonfu} of cottolene 
or other fat or dripping, bring to a boil and break into the pan 
as many eggs as you need. Slip a spatula under each, as soon 
as it is fairly "set" and reverse it dexterously if you like "turned" 



^ 

Trim ragged and discolored edges, arrange in the center of a 
hot platter and lay the bacon about them. 

Fried eggs with brown sauce 

Put a good lump of butter into the frying-pan, and when it 
hisses sharply, cook the eggs as directed in the last recipe. When 
done, dish and keep them hot over boiling water. Now put two 
more tablespoonfuls of butter into the pan ; fry brown, then add 
one tablespoonful of vinegar and a little onion juice with pepper 
and salt. Boil the whole together for two minutes, pour it over 
the eggs, and serve. 

Deviled eggs 

Boil six eggs hard, cut carefully in. half, and take out the yolks. 
Rub these to a paste with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 
one-half teaspoonful of Chili sauce, and a saltspoonful, each, of 
salt, pepper and French mustard. Form this mixture into balls 
that will fit into the halved whites. Set these halves on end on 
a hot platter, put a yolk-ball in each, and keep hot while you 
make the sauce to pour about them. To make this, cook together 
a teaspoonful of butter and one of flour, and pour over them a 
half pint of hot milk with a pinch of soda stirred in it. When 
this sauce is thick and smooth, add to it one beaten egg and a 
tablespoonful of finely minced parsley. Remove immediately 
from the fire and pour around the eggs. 



EGGS 81 

Mince of tongue and eggs 

Boil a fresh calf's tongue, let it get cold, and mince fine. Heat 
a half-pint of soup stock, and cook together in a frying-pan a 
tablespoonful of butter and one of browned flour. On this pour 
the hot soup stock, and cook until you have a thick, brown sauce. 
Into this turn the chopped tongue, and toss and stir until smoking 
hot. Season with a teaspoonful of tomato catsup, a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, salt and pepper. Have ready slices of toast on a 
heated platter, pour the hot mixture over these ; put a poached 
egg in the center of each slice of toast, and serve. 

Kidneys are delicious cooked in this way. 

Mince of ham and eggs 

Prepare as above, but using cold boiled and minced ham in 
place of the tongue. A mixture of cold liver and ham is very pal- 
atable. 

Savory eggs 

Dissolve a pinch of soda in a cup of cream and heat the cream. 
In another vessel heat a pint of stock. Turn into the stock six 
beaten eggs, season to taste with salt, pepper and minced parsley ; 
cook until the eggs begin to thicken, stirring all the time ; add the 
cream and serve on slices of lightly buttered toast. 

A curry of eggs 

Put into a saucepan one tablespoonful of butter, and when this 
has melted, stir into it a tablespoonful of flour mixed with a tea- 
spoonful of curry powder. When these are thoroughly blended 
with the butter pour slowly into the saucepan a cupful of veal, 
mutton or chicken stock, half a teaspoonful of onion juice, and 
season with salt. Stir until you have a smooth sauce, then lay in 
it six hard-boiled eggs cut into slices about half an inch thick. 
Cook until the eggs are thoroughly heated.

A simple omelet 
(Contributed) 

Beat the yolks and whites of six eggs separately, and stir 
three tablespoonfuls of milk into the yolks. Melt a tablespoonful 
of butter in a hot frying-pan. Stir the yolks and whites very 
lightly together; pepper and salt them, and turn the frothed 
mass into the frying-pan. Keep the omelet from sticking to the 
bottom and sides of the pan by frequently slipping a knife or 
cake-turner around the sides and under the bottom of the egg 
mixture. When the omelet is set, slip it off upon a hot platter, 
and, as you do so, fold it over quickly and lightly. Serve at once. 

An English omelet 

Break six eggs, and separate the yolks from the whites. Beat 
the yolks until they are thick. Add a saltspoonful of salt to the 
whites, and whip them until they are very stiff. Now, with quick 
strokes, lightly stir the whites into the yolks. Have a tablespoon- 
ful of butter melted in a frying-pan and turn the beaten eggs 
into this. With a knife keep the omelet loosened from the sides 
and bottom of the pan, and take care that it does not scorch on 
the bottom. When "set" slip the omelet upon a hot platter, and, 
as it leaves the pan, fold it over upon itself, sprinkle with salt, 
and send at once to the table. 

Omelet with tomato sauce 

Make what is known in cookery as a "white roux" by cooking 
in a saucepan a tablespoonful of butter and one of flour, and, 
when they bubble, pouring over them a cupful of strained and 
seasoned tomato juice. Keep this sauce hot while you make an 
omelet by the foregoing recipe ; dish it, and after it is on the plat- 
ter pour the tomato sauce over and around it. 

A bread omelet (baked) 

Soak three tablespoonfuls of stale crumbs in a cupful of milk 
for two hours. Beat six eggs whites and yolks separately 



EGGS 83 

very light. Into the yolks stir the soaked crumbs, and season 
the mixture with salt and pepper. Last of all, stir in with a few 
light strokes the stiffened whites. Butter a deep pudding dish, 
pour the mixture into this, set it on the lower grating of a quick 
oven and bake until light and brown. Sift brown crumbs over 
the top and serve the omelet as soon as it is removed from the 
oven. 

Omelet aux fines herbes 

Chop finely parsley, thyme, summer savory, chives, or any 
green herbs you fancy; make two tablespoonfuls in all; season 
with paprika and celery salt. Make an omelet in the usual way, 
pour into the pan, and, before it forms, sprinkle the herbs over 
the surface, stirring gently to mix them. Cook then as you 
would a plain omelet. A parsley omelet is made according to this 
recipe, using no herbs except parsley. 

Oyster omelet 

Before putting your omelet over the fire, have ready the fill- 
ing. Chop a dozen oysters into tiny bits. Stir together over the 
fire a large spoonful of butter and one of flour. When smooth 
and bubbling draw to the side of the range and add gradually 
three tablespoonfuls of cream (with a pinch of soda), and the 
same quantity of strained oyster liquor. Set back over the fire 
and stir until it boils. Season with paprika and salt; add the 
chopped oysters, and bring again to a boil. Set in boiling water 
while you make the omelet: When this is ready to fold over, 
cover with the cooked oysters, fold, and turn out upon a very 
hot dish. 

Clam omelet is made in the same way. 

Baked mushroom omelet 

Peel and cut into quarters a dozen fresh mushrooms and put 
them into a saucepan with a tablespoonful of butter, pepper and 
salt to taste, and a few drops of lemon juice. Cover the pan and 
simmer slowly for ten minutes. Add one cupful of thickened 



84 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

chicken or veal stock, and cook slowly ten minutes longer. Then 
stir in six eggs, well-beaten, turn into a buttered bake-dish, sift 
browned crumbs over the top, and set upon the upper grating of 
a quick oven until the eggs are "set." Five minutes should be 
enough. Serve at once in the bake-dish. 

Daffodils 

Chop the whites of six hard-boiled eggs fine, then run through 
a vegetable press. Have ready a cup of drawn butter, seasoned 
with pepper, salt and onion juice. Mix the whites with this, and 
keep hot over boiling water. Have ready eight rounds of toast, 
buttered and slightly moistened with gravy chicken, veal or 
turkey. Arrange on a hot platter and cover each round with the 
white mixture, flattening it on top. 

Run the yolks through the press, reducing them to a yellow 
powder, season with salt and pepper, and put a spoonful in the 
center of each white round. 

Nesting eggs 

Boil six eggs hard, and throw into cold water. When cold, 
strip off the whites and shred them into long straws. Heat a flat 
dish one that will bear fire and arrange the shreds around 
the inner edge. Have ready a handful of celery (shredded like 
the eggs), which has been stewed tender in a little milk, then sea- 
soned. Lay this inside of the lines of white shavings, and put a 
few spoonfuls of melted butter over both. Set in the oven until 
very hot. 

Pick to pieces a cupful of cold boiled or baked fish, and run 
the yolks of the eggs through the colander or vegetable press. 
Mix with the fish, moisten with drawn butter, and mold into 
egg-shaped balls. Dispose these neatly within the "nest," and 
pour over them a cupful of drawn butter to give the desired 
whiteness. Shut up in the oven for a few minutes to get them 
heated through, and serve. 

This is a less elaborate dish than would seem at first reading.

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 




CHICKEN OMELET 



EGGS 85 

If you have stewed celery left from yesterday's dinner, and cold 
fish, the rest is easy enough. 

Chicken or other meat may be substituted for the fish. 

Cheese omelet 

Make a plain omelet, and when nearly done, strew powdered 
Parmesan cheese over it. Fold, transfer to a hot dish, strew more 
cheese on top, and hold a red-hot shovel near enough to scorch the 
cheese. 

Baked souffle of eggs (No. 1) 

Scald a cup of milk, putting in a tiny pinch of soda. Beat the 
yolks of six eggs until light and creamy, and the whites till stiff 
enough to stand alone. Add one-half teaspoonful of salt, a dash 
of pepper and one rounded tablespoonful of butter to the milk 
and stir it into the yolks ; then beat in the whites very quickly. 
Pour into a deep, buttered pudding dish and bake in a moderate 
oven ten minutes, or to a delicate brown. Serve immediately in 
the bake-dish. 

Baked eggs souffle (No. 2) 

Beat six eggs light, whites and yolks separately. Heat one cup- 
ful of milk, add one teaspoonful of corn-starch, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, and the whipped yolks of the eggs. Cook in a 
saucepan until as thick as cream, add the whites, beaten stiff, put 
into a well-buttered frying-pan, set in a hot oven and bake well 
until browned slightly, then slide off upon a hot platter. 

Eggs and tomatoes 

Cook a tablespoonful of butter and one of flour together in a 
saucepan until smooth and hot. Add a cupful of tomatoes, 
canned or raw, chopped fine, and strained from the juice. Season 
with paprika, celery salt, a half teaspoonful of sugar, and a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice. Cook five minutes. Have ready on a 
bowl six eggs, beaten whites and yolks together ; take the sauce- 
pan from the fire and add the contents gradually to the eggs. 



86 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Set back over the fire, stir for one minute, or until the eggs are 
set, and serve in a hot, deep dish. 

Olla podrida omelet 

Make a roux of one tablespoonful of butter and the same of 
browned flour in a deep frying-pan. When hissing hot stir in 
one cupful of canned tomato, one-half cupful of canned mush- 
rooms, sliced fine, the same quantity of minced ham, tongue or 
chicken. Season with onion juice, paprika and salt to taste. Let 
it simmer five or eight minutes, then stir in four beaten eggs. 
Stir carefully as it thickens, and when the eggs are set serve on 
buttered toast. 

Scrambled eggs with cheese 
(Contributed) 

Break ten eggs and slip them into a saucepan. Beat them with 
one-fourth of a pound of butter, one-fourth of a pound of grated 
cheese and salt and pepper to taste. Butter a saucepan and 
when hot, pour in the mixture and allow it to cook for five min- 
utes over a light fire, stirring all the while. When the mixture 
becomes quite thick, pour into a deep dish, and serve with fried 
toast. 

Scrambled eggs with asparagus tops 
(Contributed) 

Cut the tender tops of asparagus into pieces one-half inch long. 
Cook them in salted water for about ten minutes, then let them 
drain. Scramble the eggs and when they are cooked add the 
asparagus tops and serve on toast. Lobsters, cooked and cut into 
dice, may be substituted for the asparagus tops. 

Rice omelet 

(Contributed) 

To one cupful of cold boiled rice add one cupful of warm 
milk, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one teaspoon ful of salt 



EGGS 87 

and a dash of pepper ; mix well and add three well-beaten eggs. 
Heat a tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan and when hot 
pour in the omelet and set the pan in a hot oven. When it is 
thoroughly cooked fold it double, turn out on a hot dish and 
serve at once. 

Fish omelet 
(Contributed) 

Make about a half pint of white roux, add a piece of butter 
about the size of an egg, twelve shelled and cooked shrimps ; sea- 
son with salt and pepper; let it cook for two or three minutes, 
stirring all the time, then add half of a green sweet pepper, 
chopped fine, and cook for one minute. Make an omelet of six 
eggs ; when brown, turn up and fill with this mixture. Serve at 
once on a hot platter. 

Frizzled beef and eggs 

(Contributed) 

To every half pound of chipped beef allow half a pint of milk, 
one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of flour. Put 
the butter into a frying-pan ; when hot add the beef and stir for 
about two minutes, or until the butter begins to brown, then 
dredge in the flour. Stir well, add the milk and a little pepper, 
and just before taking from the fire whip in two well-beaten eggs. 

Ham omelet 

(Contributed) 

Make an omelet in the usual way; pour into an omelet pan 
and before the egg sets sprinkle over the top one teacupful of 
finely minced, cold, cooked ham. 

Egg croquettes 

(Contributed) 

Cut hard-boiled eggs into one-quarter inch dice. Add one- 
fourth as many chopped mushrooms and turn into a thick white

sauce. When cold, mold into croquettes, dip into egg, then in 
bread crumbs and fry in deep fat. 

Eggs in cases 

(Contributed) 

Make little paper cases of buttered writing paper ; put a small 
piece of butter in each and a little chopped parsley or onion ; 
pepper and salt. Put the cases upon a gridiron over a moderate 
fire of bright coals, and when the butter melts break a fresh egg 
into each case. Strew over them a few buttered bread-crumbs, 
and when almost done glaze the tops with a hot shovel. 

Minced eggs 

(Contributed) 

Chop up, but not too fine, four or five hard-boiled eggs. Put 
over the fire, in a saucepan, one tablespoonful of butter, and when 
it begins to bubble, stir into it one tablespoonful of flour; cook 
one minute, then add one cupful of hot milk. When it cooks 
thick like cream, put in the minced eggs. Stir it for a few 
minutes, and serve garnished with sippets of toast. 

Scalloped eggs 

(Contributed) 

Slice in rings twelve hard-boiled eggs. Cover the bottom of a 
well-buttered baking dish with fine bread-crumbs ; over this 
put a layer of eggs, some small pieces of butter and sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Alternate in this way until the dish is filled, 
being careful to have bread-crumbs on top. Add two tablespoon- 
fuls of rich milk or cream and bake in a moderate oven. 

Shirred eggs 

Butter small "nappies" and drop an egg carefully into each, 
taking care not to break the yolk. Set the nappies in a pan of 
boiling water on the range, and cook until the white is set. Put 
on each egg a bit of butter, and a dash each of pepper and salt. 
Serve at once. 



FAMILIAR TALK 

WHO RULES THE HOME? 

THE question is seldom put so baldly. Indulgent husbands yield 
the point in verbal gallantry. Politic wives make it a point of 
conscience and etiquette to speak of their husbands as owners 
of house and contents and lawful directors in all pertaining 
thereunto. At heart, the complaisant Benedict knows his will to 
be potent, if not supreme, in home and family. The wedded Beat- 
rice is secretly conscious that she can wind her boastful Benedict 
about her taper finger, and he will not suspect. 

An old, old ballad, warbled with sly smiles by our foremothers, 
thus sums up her view of the matter : 

" Now, sisters, since we've made it plain 

That the case is really so, 
We'll even let them hold the rein, 
But we'll show them the way to go ! " 

Honest John, while his sinewy fingers feel the taut rein be- 
tween them, believes himself master of the situation. He pays 
for house, food and servants, and often works hard for the 
money that secures these for his family. Upon general principles 
he has a right to know that the money is wisely spent and hus- 
banded ; a right to be well lodged and fed and made as comfort- 
able when at home as his means will allow. If he sees furniture 
abused, food badly hence unwholesomely cooked, and needless 
waste in any department, he has an unquestionable right to direct 
his wife's attention to the existing state of things, and insist 
that it be amended. On the other hand, in giving his wife his 
name, he has made her the managing, as he is the financial, part- 
ner of the firm matrimonial. 

She is not his hireling. 

89 



90 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Failure to comprehend this vital truth wrecks the happiness of 
more married couples than incompatibility of temper, fickleness 
and intemperance, all put together. 

A reasonably good wife earns so much more than her own 
living that the surplus ought to go to her credit. If not in 
money, in a hundred other ways. When John stoops to captious 
surveillance of her methods, and personal inspection of her work, 
he degrades her to the position of a suspected menial, and sinks 
his manhood into Bettyishness. "Bettyishness," according to lex- 
icographers, is the synonym for "womanishness," and for John 
to be "womanish" is to be unmanly ; Mary would rather have him 
savage, now and then. 

I saw a spotless reputation discounted the other day, and many 
rare, amiable traits of disposition shrivel as waste paper in the 
fire, under a single sarcastic utterance of a society woman who 
had her own reasons for disliking the person under discussion. 

"Yes!" she said, dubiously, to the praise an elderly matron 
had given an excellent son and brother. "But, then, he is such 
a ladylike person !" 

The epithet was apt. Not one of us could deny it. Every 
woman present, while she laughed, would have preferred to have 
her husband called a brute. 

John takes ugly risks when he tempts his hitherto loyal spouse 
to name him to her confidential self as "Bettyish," "Miss Nancy- 
ish" or a "Mollycoddle." They all mean the same thing. As a 
sloven he may be forgiven in consideration of the solid manliness 
back of personal carelessness. We wink at rusty shoes, and col- 
lars awry, and tousled hair, and missing sleeve-links. For the 
same reason we condone crossness, and even a touch of savagery. 
When he comes horhe "in a temper," he has had a trying day 
down town, or he is hot, or headachy, or hungry. Womanly in- 
genuity is set to work to soothe down the inclement mood, and 
womanly love glides to the front with the mantle of tenderest 
charity to hide the fault from others, and put it out of our own 
minds when it is past. 

I know a man squarely-built, robust and keen-eyed who 
carries the keys of the store-room, and lends them to his wife at 



FAMILIAR TALK 91 

night and morning to give out the supplies needed for the daily 
meals. He registers in day-book and ledger every pound of but- 
ter and box of crackers and quart of vinegar brought into the 
house, with the date of purchase. 

I knew another (who ceased from his labors ten years ago), 
who visited kitchen, pantries and store-room several times every 
week to see that everything was clean and orderly. He used to 
smell milk-pans, run a critical finger around the insidcs of kettles 
and pots and inquire into the destination of scraps and all with- 
out a blush or misgiving. In each case it was, of course, impos- 
sible to keep servants who could get any other place. Wives 
belong to the class that can not give warning. 

If either of these men would have tolerated the apparition in 
his counting-room or office, at stated, or irregular, periods of his 
wife bent upon inspection of accounts and sales, the clerks un- 
dergoing examination, or standing as witnesses of his humilia- 
tion then he was justified to his conscience for his policy of 
home rule. 

Mary would go to prison for her John, and to the scaffold with 
him. She springs to arms in his defense if her nearest of kin dare 
to intimate that he is not the pink of perfection she would have 
them believe. His grossest eccentricities are graces so long as 
they are masculine. 

But let him prowl into the pantry, peep into the bread-box, 
criticize the arrangement or derangement of china-shelves, pull 
open linen drawers, spy out dusty rungs of chairs, take down, 
sort, and hang in better order the contents of clothes-hooks and 
hat-racks and he may shift for and shield himself. With lofty 
scorn the .wife of his immaculate shirt bosom leaves him to the 
fate he deserves. 

In which course there is some reason and a little unreason. 
For which of us does not draw upon John's sympathies in her 
domestic distresses? He must not undertake the management of 
Bridget, or Daphne, or Marie. These be womanish matters, in 
which a man should not intermeddle. It may be the most tem- 
perate of suggestions, such as, "My dear, I don't like to find 
fault, but if you would speak to Margaret about meddling with 



92 .. MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the papers upon my table when she dusts the library?" It is a 
distinct trespass upon wifely preserves. Margaret is under the 
protection of her mistress' wing. The interests and credit of the 
two are identical. But there comes a day when the league snaps 
in two, like scorched twine. The maid gives warning, and com- 
pany is expected, and the mistress "did think she had a right to 
expect better things from Margaret, after all the kindness she 
has shown her in sickness and in health, and the excellent wages 
she has given her, and here, at the most inconvenient time she 
could have chosen, the creature is deserting her !" 

Thus runs the torrent of talk into the ears of a man who 
left a much worse complication behind him in his office when 
he set his face toward home and imaginary peace. Had he 
found fault with Margaret a week ago, he would have been a 
"Molly." Should he withhold sympathy from the mistress to-day, 
to the extent of commending the ingrate's past services, and won- 
dering if there may not be possible palliation somewhere for her 
present behavior he is unfeeling, and u a MAN !" When a 
woman brings out the monosyllable in that accent, she may as 
well go a semi-tone higher and say, "Monster !" 

To be explicit, John must dance when his spouse puts the pipes 
to her lips, and not presume to mourn but at her lamenting. As 
her sister, my sympathies topple dangerously toward her. As an 
impartial chronicler I can not deny that much may be said in his 
defense, even when he is convicted of womanish meddling. He 
is but a passenger upon the domestic craft in fair weather, a pay- 
ing passenger, who is expected, nevertheless, to be smilingly con- 
tent with his accommodations, to eat as he is fed, sleep upon the 
bed as it is made, and to complain of nothing until the sea gets 
rough, and another and a stout hand is needed on deck and in 
the rigging. 

The principle should work well both ways, or it will go to 
pieces of its own weight. 




FISH FOR BREAKFAST 

A modern Peter Magnus, always on the alert for coincidences, 
once called my attention to the singular fitness of the height of 
the fish season and the coming of Lent. 

"It happens uncommonly convenient, at any rate. How very, 
very awkward it would 'be if there were no fish in the market 
just when the Church forbids meat!" prosed my interlocutor, 
whose nationality I need not specify. 

I might have replied, had there been any hope of his seeing 
the point of the story, with the anecdote of one of his country- 
men who invited me to view the total eclipse of the moon through 
his telescope, and, while I gazed, remarked upon the happy acci- 
dent that this particular eclipse "had taken place at the full of 
the moon." 

Dame Nature adjusts kindly and cleverly all seasons and hap- 
penings to the need of her children. Fish, easily digested and rich 
in phosphates, are in their delicious prime as winter suddenly re- 
laxes her hold upon our world and our systems. We needed fats 
to keep up animal fats in cold weather. The first warmer days 
ease the taut running-gear of muscles, nerves and digestive ap- 
paratus. She cries, " 'Ware meat !" peremptorily. However deaf 
we may be to the Church's behest, we can not afford to disregard 
the Great Mother's. 

The breaking up of winter, the general letting down of phy- 
sical energies and the abundant supply of food precisely adapted 
to the season's needs, form a "coincidence" that the most stupid 
must perceive. The like principle of demand and supply might, 
one might imagine, be recognized in the matter of breakfast 
foods. Fish, rightly cooked, tempts the appetite and does not 

93 



94 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

overload the stomach. Another recommendation which should 
have weight with commuters and "hustlers," is that the yielding 
fibers require less strenuous mastication than those of steaks, 
chops and rashers. 

The truism that as a nation we are inordinate flesh-consumers 
is tattered by much wear. Since vegetarianism comes as a hard 
lesson to the mass of our race, and the exacting palate demands 
more definite flavors than those of eggs in any form, resort to 
crustacean and finny delicacies should follow as a matter of 
course and of common sense. 

Shad 

Sturgeon is known in England as the "Queen's Own Fish." 
Hiawatha names him as the "King of Fishes." The American 
epicure has transferred this title to the more delicately flavored 
salmon. If a vote of native-born gourmands of all ranks of 
society were taken, I think the shad would be the elect favorite 
the dainty queen of fishes, the more royal for the wealth of roes 
that bespeak her prime. 

Planked shad 

Have your fish cleaned and split down the back. Wash and 
wipe dry. Have ready a clean oak or hickory plank, about two 
and one-half inches in thickness and of such a length that it will 
go easily into your oven. Set it in the oven until it is heated 
through. Rub your shad on both sides with an abundance of but- 
ter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay it, open side up, on 
the hot plank and fasten it firmly into place by putting a tin tack 
at each of the four corners. Lay the plank on the upper grating 
of the oven, and rub the fish with butter every few minutes until 
done. You can tell when this point is reached by testing with a 
fork. Carefully withdraw the tacks and slip the fish upon a hot 
platter. Serve with melted butter, and garnish with slices of 
lemon and sprigs of parsley. 

Broiled shad with sauce piquante 

Split the fish down the back, wash, wipe dry, and lay it open 
on a well-greased gridiron. Broil over clear coals, taking care 



FISH FOR BREAKFAST 95 

to turn the fish often, as it burns easily. If the shad is a thick 
one it will take about twenty minutes to cook thoroughly. Re- 
move carefully from the gridiron, lay on a hot fish platter, but- 
ter well and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Pass with the fish a 
sauce made in the following manner : 

Rub to a cream three tablespoonfuls of butter and two tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice. Whip into this two teaspoonfuls of 
finely minced parsley. The sauce should be light green in color. 
Keep in a cold place until time to serve it with the fish. 

Fried shad 

Mrs. S. T. Rorer, whose authority on culinary counsels few 
dare dispute, says : "Shad, being rich in oils, should never be 
fried." 

In tide-water Virginia, where shad are eaten in their perfec- 
tion and within a few hours after they are drawn from the river, 
frying is almost popular method of preparing them. Some cooks 
there rid the fish of all suspicion of an oily taste by holding it up 
by the gills and pouring a pint or so of boiling water over it. 
After the shower-bath it is immediately laid in ice water to keep 
the flesh firm. Then have the shad split down the back, and cut 
each half of the fish into four pieces. Wash quickly and wipe 
dry. Roll in beaten egg and cracker crumbs, lay the pieces, side 
by side, on a platter and set in the ice-box for two hours. Fry to 
a golden brown in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. Drain 
all the grease off in a colander ; arrange the fish in neat order on 
a folded napkin laid in the bottom of a fish platter. Garnish with 
slices of lemon and sprigs of parsley. Serve Bechamel sauce with' 
the fish. 

Shad croquettes 

Flake the remains of yesterday's fish into bits with a silver fork. 
There should be about a cupful of the picked fish. Cook to- 
gether a tablespoon ful of flour and one of butter and pour upon 
them a cup of milk. Stir to a thick sauce ; pour this gradually 
upon the beaten yolks of two eggs, mix well, add the flaked fish, 



96 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

season to taste, and turn upon a platter to cool and stiffen. When 
the mixture is cold and firm form it into small croquettes and roll 
these, first in cracker dust, then in beaten egg, and once again in 
cracker dust. Set aside in a cool place for two hours, and fry 
in deep boiling cottolene or other fat brought slowly to the boil. 
Serve with sliced lemon. 

Scalloped shad 

Pick cold shad into bits, removing skin and bones. Put two 
tablespoonfuls of butter into a frying-pan and fry a sliced onion in 
this. Remove the onion, stir in a tablespoonful of browned flour, 
and, when this is blended with the butter, pour upon it slowly a 
cup of clear beef-stock. Stir to a smooth sauce, season with pep- 
per and salt, a very little kitchen bouquet, and a half-cup of 
tomato liquor. When smooth and as thick as cream, add the fish, 
stir and toss for a moment and remove from the fire. Turn into 
scallop shells, sprinkle with crumbs and bake, covered, for twenty 
minutes ; then uncover and brown. 

Broiled shad roes 

Parboil the roes in salted water as soon as they are taken from 
the fish. Cook ten minutes and leave in ice water until cold and 
firm. "Marinade" them in bath of lemon juice and salad oil for 
one hour. Wipe lightly and broil to a nice brown, turning sev- 
eral times. Pass with lemon sauce. 

Fried shad roes 

Parboil as directed, let them get chilled in ice water, wipe dry, 
roll in beaten egg and salted cracker crumbs and fry in deep hot 
cottolene or other fat heated gradually to the boiling point before 
the roes go in. 

Scallops of shad roes 

Parboil and blanch. When perfectly cold break up and pass 
through a colander or vegetable press. Season with lemon juice, 



FISH FOR BREAKFAST 97 

kitchen bouquet, paprika and salt. Have ready a cup of rich 
drawn butter. Stir the roes into it, beat up well, pour into scal- 
lop shells or pate-pans, sift fine crumbs over the top and bake 
quickly upon the upper grating of the oven. 

Shad roe croquettes 

Proceed as with the scallops, except that you make the drawn 
butter rather thicker, and add a well-beaten egg, together with a 
tablespoonful of fine crumbs, to give the croquettes consistency. 
Let the mixture get perfectly cold; mold into croquettes, roll in 
egg and cracker crumbs and leave on the ice over night. In the 
morning renew the crumbs and fry in deep hissing cottolene or 
other fat which has been brought gradually to the boil. 

Fried smelts with lemon sauce 

Clean, wash and dry the smelts. Roll in salted and peppered 
flour, and leave in a cold place for an hour to get firm. Fry in 
deep cottolene or other fat to a light brown, laying each in a hot 
colander as you take it from the pan, to drain of! the grease. 
Serve in a hot dish. A pretty way of serving them is to fringe 
several thicknesses of white tissue paper at both ends, and lay 
in the bottom of the dish, the fringe showing beyond the heap of 
fish. Serve with 

Lemon sauce 

Heat (not melt) three tablespoon fuls of butter until you can 
beat it to a cream. Whip into it the strained juice of one large 
or two small lemons, with a heaping tablespoonful of finely- 
minced parsley. It should be like a light-green cream when 
done. Fill with this mixture the halves of lemons, from which 
all the pulp and inner skin have been scraped, and garnish the 
dish of smelts with them, serving one of the "cups" with each 
portion of fish. 



98 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Fried trout 

Clean, wipe inside and out, pepper and salt ; roll in egg and 
cracker crumbs and fry in deep, hot cottolene or other fat, always 
recollecting to heat this gradually to boiling point before the fish 
go in. 

Or, having cleaned and dried them, roll in salted and peppered 
meal ; then fry. 

Fried perch and other pan-fish 

Cook as directed in last recipe. It is always well to have the 
fish on ice for an hour or more after they are egged and breaded, 
or rolled in meal. 

Fish cutlets 

Mince cold boiled or baked salmon, haddock, cod, or any other 
firm-fleshed fish. Season to taste and mix well with a little rich 
drawn butter, made quite thick with corn starch. Spread upon 
a broad platter, and, when stiff, cut into the desired shape with 
a tin "form." Roll in fine crumbs, then in egg and in cracker 
crumbs again ; leave on the ice to get firm, and fry in deep, boiling 
cottolene or other fat which has been heated slowly. 



Lobster and crab cutlets 
Are made in the same way. 

Salmon steaks 

Have the steaks cut nearly an inch thick. Wipe with a damp 
cloth and lay in salad oil for an hour. Drain and put upon a 
gridiron over a clear fire. Broil slowly, rubbing with butter from 
time to time. They will take at least twenty minutes to cook, 
and must be watched carefully that they do not scorch. When 
done, put upon each steak a generous lump of butter and sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. 



FISH FOR BREAKFAST 99 

Salmon loaf 

Flake cold boiled salmon and moisten it with a gill of cream, 
a half-gill of milk and two beaten eggs. Stir in a handful of 
fine crumbs, the juice of half a lemon, a tablespoonful of butter, 
salt and pepper to taste, and a tablespoonful of minced parsley. 
Mix thoroughly, turn into a greased pudding-dish, and bake in 
a steady oven for about three-quarters of an hour, then turn out 
upon a hot platter. Serve with a white sauce. You may also 
boil this in a covered mold. 



Salmon croquettes 

With a silver fork flake the contents of a can of salmon, or 
two pounds of fresh salmon, into bits removing all pieces of 
skin and bone and season to taste with salt, pepper and a few 
drops of lemon juice. Cook together a tablespoonful, each, of 
butter and flour, and when they bubble pour upon them a cup of 
milk. Stir to a smooth, white sauce, add slowly a raw egg, then 
turn in the salmon mixed with two tablespoonfuls of fine crumbs. 
When the salmon is heated remove from the fire and set aside to 
cool. When cold, form into croquettes, roll these in beaten egg 
and cracker crumbs and set in the ice-box for an hour before 
frying in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat, which has been 
heated gradually. 

Scalloped salmon 

With a silver fork pick into bits the contents of a can of 
salmon, rejecting all particles of skin and bone. Make a sauce 
of a half-pint of. milk, thickened with a white roux, and turn the 
salmon into this. Stir and toss over the fire until smoking-hot ; 
season to taste, put into a greased pudding-dish. Strew thickly 
with crumbs, dot with bits of butter and bake for twenty min- 
utes. 

Broiled haddock 

Haddock is not popular among "good livers" in the United 
States. For some reason it is ranked as a second-hand and 
plebeian fish. Yet it can be made good although cheap. 



zoo MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Clean, wash and wipe well, and gash the back with a sharp 
knife. Then "marinade" as you would his patrician brethren : 
i. e., cover him with salad oil and vinegar, or lemon juice, and 
let him lie in the bath for an hour. Wipe and broil, turning 
when half done. Transfer to a hot dish, anoint with butter, 
lemon and chopped parsley, and send to table. 

Haddock fillets 

Two pounds of what the cooks call "the thick of the fish" will 
make four fillets, about four inches long by two wide. Skin 
each piece with a sharp knife; trim into shape and leave in a 
marinade of oil and vinegar with a tablespoonful of minced 
chives, or, if you have none, a tablespoonful of onion juice. 
Let the fillets lie there for an hour. Then drain well, roll in a 
good batter, afterward in fine crumbs, and fry in deep, boiling 
cottolene or other fat. Drain upon hot tissue paper, and send 
to table very hot. Send around tomato sauce with it. 

Halibut fillets 
May be cooked in the same way. 

Broiled halibut steak 

Rub well with salad oil and lemon juice on both sides, wipe, 
and broil over a clear fire, turning three times. Pepper and salt, 
lay upon a hot dish and butter well. Send Bearnaise sauce 
around with it. (See Sauces.) 

Fried halibut steaks 

Marinade for an hourj drain, roll in salted flour, then in beaten 
egg, lastly in salted and peppered crumbs. Leave on ice for an 
hour, and fry in clarified dripping, or in cottolene or other fat. 




FISH 



FISH FOR BREAKFAST 101 

Fried pickerel with cream sauce 

Clean, wash and wipe dry. Roll in white cornmeal or in flour, 
and lay aside in a cold place while you fry slices of fat salt pork 
quickly almost to a crisp. Strain the fat and return to the pan ; 
lay in the fish and brown, turning once. When done, remove to 
a heated, covered dish and keep hot over boiling water. To the 
fat left in the pan add a tablespoonful of butter and a little 
boiling water ; boil up and stir in a tablespoonful of flour. When 
it begins to bubble add four tablespoonfuls of cream with a tiny 
pinch of soda. Stir until smoking-hot, and strain over the fish. 

Fried catfish 

Skin and clean ; lay the fish in very cold water for a few min- 
utes, then wipe them dry. Dredge thoroughly with flour, or roll 
them first in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs, and fry to a 
delicate brown. 

Fried frogs' legs 

Have them carefully skinned, wash well, wipe perfectly dry, 
roll in cracker or bread crumbs, dip in well-beaten egg, then 
roll again in the crumbs and fry in butter to a golden brown. 

Fricassee of frogs' legs 

Skin and wash well, drain ; lay in boiling water for five min- 
utes. Put over the fire in enough warm milk to cover them and 
simmer until tender. Then drain, and lay in a hot dish, butter- 
ing well. In another saucepan make drawn butter, using milk 
instead of water ; season with salt, paprika and minced parsley, 
with a dash of lemon juice ; remove from the fire and stir in two 
well-beaten eggs. Cook one minute, stirring all the time, and 
take from the range. Pour over the frogs' legs, cover, and set 
over hot water for a few minutes before serving. They will be 
found delicious. 



102 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Stewed frogs' legs 

Skin and lay in a marinade of lemon juice and salad oil, with a 
dash of onion juice or of minced chives, for one hour. Heat two 
tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan, add a teaspoonful of 
minced onion, one minced tomato and one green pepper chopped 
fine. Cook for five minutes. Add the frogs' legs, cover closely 
and cook ten minutes. Add a little browned flour and cook until 
tender. Season and serve. 

Clams on toast 

Chop a dozen clams and boil them for five minutes in their 
liquor ; drain, arid add to them two tablespoonfuls of fine crumbs, 
a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste, and a gill of 
milk in which a heaping teaspoonful of cornstarch has been dis- 
solved. Stir constantly over the fire until the mixture boils, 
then add a gill of cream ; stir for a moment longer and pour upon 
the toast. 

Deviled clams 

Slice an onion and fry it to a light brown in a large spoonful 
of butter. Strain out the onion and put the hot butter back upon 
the fire. Chop two large (peeled) tomatoes fine, season with 
salt, half a teaspoonful of sugar, a good dash of paprika and the 
same of nutmeg. Stir into the hissing butter ; stir for three 
minutes, and add a teaspoonful of butter rolled in half as much 
flour. Have ready the clams, drained and chopped fine, and mix 
them with the butter and tomatoes. Fill buttered scallop-shells, 
or clam-shells, or a buttered pudding-dish with the mixture ; sift 
fine-crushed cracker over all, dropping tiny dabs of butter on 
top, and cook until delicately browned. 

Fried clams 

Drain the clams and dry them by laying them on a soft napkin. 
Season with a dust of paprika. Beat two eggs light in a soup- 
plate and have ready in another deep plate an abundance of 



FISH FOR BREAKFAST 103 

cracker crumbs. Dip each clam in the egg, and then in the 
crumbs, until thoroughly coated. Lay side by side on a large 
platter and set in a cold place for an hour. Fry in deep, boiling 
cottolene or other fat to a golden brown, drain in a colander, 
then transfer to a hot platter. Garnish with slices of lemon 
and sprigs of parsley. 

Clam scallop 

Drain the liquor from two cupfuls of soft clams and set aside 
while you chop the clams fine. Moisten two cupfuls of cracker 
crumbs with equal parts of clam liquor and milk, season with 
paprika and a tablespoonful of melted butter, and lastly, add 
three beaten eggs; and the chopped clams. Mix thoroughly, and 
turn into a greased pudding-dish. Bake until brown and serve 
from the dish in which the scallop was cooked. 



Clam fritters 

Make a batter of a pint of flour sifted twice with an even tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder and half as much salt; one cup of 
milk, half a cup of clam liquor and two well-beaten eggs. Chop 
two dozen soft clams fine ; season with salt and pepper, add to the 
batter, arid drop by the tablespoonful into deep, boiling cottolene 
or other fat which has been heated slowly. They are made more 
digestible and, to my taste, more palatable by cooking the batter, 
as you do griddle-cakes, upon a soapstone griddle. 

Fried scallops 

Parboil in hot salted water for five minutes; drain and set 
them upon ice to get cold and firm. Roll them in salted flour, 
next in beaten egg, then in fine crumbs. Set on ice for half an 
hour and fry in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat, which has 
been gradually heated to the boil. 



104 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Curried scallops 

Stew the scallops in just enough oyster liquor to cover them. 
(Your fish merchant will give you all the oyster liquor you want 
and be glad to get rid of it.) Bring gradually to the boil, after 
which cook two minutes. Have ready in another vessel a roux 
made by stirring into a great spoonful of hissing hot butter a 
tablespoonful of white flour and a teaspoonful of curry powder. 
Add to these, when smooth and all a-bubble, the hot liquor from 
the scallops, a little at a time, keeping the spoon busy until all is 
in. Lastly, put in the scallops ; boil one minute and serve. Gar- 
nish with rice croquettes, serving these instead of plain boiled 
rice. Send around sliced lemons with this dish. The lovers 
of scallops will enjoy it. 

Soft-shelled crabs 

Remove the fringe, or loose shell, from each side of the crab, 
and the sandbag; then cut off the eyes. Wash the crabs well, 
dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper and roll in flour. Fry in 
butter, turning frequently. When nicely browned they are done. 

Creamed codfish 

Flake cold boiled cod into bits with a silver fork. Cook to- 
gether a tablespoonful of flour and one of butter, and pour upon 
them a cup of milk. Season to taste and, when smooth, stir in 
the flaked fish. Stir and toss until very hot, add salt and pepper 
and serve. 

Fish-balls 

If salt cod be used, shred it finely and soak six hours. Boil 
half an hour and let it cool. Mash potatoes to a cream ; allow 
half as much potato as you have fish. Mix and heat by setting 
in a pan of boiling water over the fire, stirring frequently. When 
hot, beat in an egg, whip the mixture smooth ; let the paste get 
cold, make into cakes or balls, roll in flour and set on ice. Of 
course, this should be done over night. In the morning fry in 



FISH FOR BREAKFAST 105 

deep boiling beef dripping, clarified, or in cottolene or other fat. 
Cold fresh cod makes delicious ''balls." Proceed as with the 
salt, leaving out the soaking, and salting to taste. 

Boiled salt mackerel 

Wash and go all over the fish with a stiff whisk to dislodge 
salt crystals. Put on to soak in warm water, exchanging this 
three hours later for warmer, and leave all night. In the morn- 
ing cover with hot water and set at the side of the range. Half 
an hour before breakfast drain and put into boiling water to 
which a tablespoon ful of vinegar has been added, and boil gently 
for twenty-five minutes. Drain and lay upon a hot dish. Cover 
with a white sauce into which -a finely-chopped boiled egg has 
been stirred, and serve. You may substitute tomato sauce for 
white, if you like. It is very nice when milk is used instead of 
water in boiling it. 

Broiled salt mackerel 

Soak and proceed as in the last recipe. Early in the morning 
take the fish from the hot water, cover with ice-cold water for five 
minutes ; wipe dry, "marinade" in olive oil and lemon juice for 
half an hour, drain and broil. Serve with sauce tartare. 

Fried eels 

Skin, clean well, taking especial heed of the fat, which must 
be removed to the last bit. Cut into short pieces, marinade in 
salad oil and vinegar for an hour ; roll, first in salted flour, then 
in beaten egg, then in rolled cracker, and fry in deep, boiling 
cottolene or other fat. Drain, dash and garnish with parsley 
and lemon. 

Stewed eels 

Skin and clean ; cut into short lengths, lay in cold water for 
half an hour; then put over the fire in cold water, just enough 
to cover them, and cook slowly for half an hour, or more, ac- 
cording to their size. A large eel may require an hour to make 



io6 MARION HAKLAND'S COOK BOOK 

it tender. Turn off the water, cover the eels with a good white 
sauce seasoned with paprika, onion juice, salt and minced pars- 
ley; simmer five minutes and serve. 

Hoe herring (smoked) 

Soak over night when you have washed it well. In the morn- 
ing lay in hot water for half an hour, then in ice-cold water for ten 
minutes, wipe dry and grill on a gridiron over a clear fire. It is 
most appetizing. Pass corn bread with it. 

Finnan haddie 

Wash the fish thoroughly, leave in cold water for three-quar- 
ters of an hour, then lay in scalding water for five minutes. 
Wipe very dry, rub butter and lemon juice well into the fiber of 
the fish and broil over a clear fire for fifteen minutes. Serve 
with a hot butter sauce, or with sauce tartare. 

Broiled smoked salmon 

Wash a piece of smoked salmon in several waters, and soak it 
for an hour. Cover with lukewarm water in a saucepan and sim- 
mer for twenty minutes. Drain and wipe very dry, then broil on 
a buttered gridiron until browned on both sides. Transfer to a 
hot dish, rub with butter, sprinkle lightly with pepper and 
minced parsley, garnish with sliced lemon, and serve. 

Fried smoked salmon 

Wash, soak and parboil the salmon as in the former recipe. 
Wipe very dry, roll in egg and cracker dust, and set in a cold 
place for an hour before frying in hot salad oil or in cottolene or 
other fat. Serve with sauce tartare. 



FAMILIAR TALK 



WHERE WE EAT 

eat to live ; we do not live to eat," is a time-stained say- 
ing. It is almost invariably uttered complacently, and seldom 
in absolute sincerity. There is something wrong, physically, 
with the man who "does not care what he eats." There is a twist 
in the moral make-up of the woman who finds catering for the 
appetites of those she loves "a wretched bore, don't you know ?" 

Next in importance to the "house-place" in the estimation of 
the wise and tender mother of the home comes the dining-room 
where, three times a day, she has her brood under the wings .of 
her comforting, provident and nourishing love. Whatever may 
be said as to the merits of the "food products" that fly at the 
masthead of the company the motto "Tell me what you eat, 
and I will tell you what you are" there is a potent grain of truth 
in the legend. 

So much of a man's temper and morals during the day de- 
pends upon what he has had for breakfast that the mother may 
well give serious thought to the composition of the meal. So 
much depends upon where and how he eats his breakfast, that 
the wonder grows in the philosophic mind that the eating-room 
and the appurtenances thereof are a third-rate consideration with 
so many otherwise excellent managers. 

The housemother who can let sunshine into the morning meet- 
ing-place of the family scores an important point in favor of the 
success of her pious scheme. Since this can not always be, her 
aim should be to simulate the blessed sunbeams as far as she can. 
Walls of pale buff, the flash of a gilt frame here, and a bit of 
bright drapery there ; yellow silk sash curtains, and, on the side-

board, the glitter of silver and glass will go far to relieve the 
depressing influence of an apartment where the sun never falls. 

Thanks to the ingenious florist whose name is preserved in the 
"Wardian case," it is quite possible to have a window-garden in 
the dining-room on the shady side of the house. A stanch 
framework of wood, filled in with glass on the sides and on the 
hinged top, with a zinc-lined bottom on which are spread first a 
layer of broken flower-pots or other crockery, mixed with char- 
coal, and on this a stratum, two inches deep, of garden mold, 
supply the foundation for the undertaking. 

Stock with ferns, tradescantia, English and German ivy, fill 
the spaces between the roots with moss, water well, and close. 
Your gardening is done for the season, except that, once a day 
say while you are at breakfast the lid is raised a little way to 
admit a supply of air, and once in a fortnight it would be well 
to water the plants. Shield from the sun, which, striking 
through the closed glass, would scald the succulent greenery that 
will soon fill the case. Hang the canary's cage above it for an 
added touch of cheer. 

Always have flowers upon the family table. A pot of ivy, a 
geranium, a fern borrowed from some other room at meal times, 
will serve the desired end if you can not afford cut flowers in 
winter. If you have no window plants, manage to get a vase of 
evergreen sprays something to lift the gracious ceremonial of 
eating together above the sordid commonplace. If you "eat to 
live," let that living be comely and pleasant. 

There is no excuse nowadays for setting a table with coarse, 
thick stoneware, even when there is no "company" (hateful 
phrase !) present. Graceful designs may be had in ware so 
cheap as to be within the reach of any woman who can spread 
a table of her own. 

In the matter of napery, modern fashion comes benevolently 
to the help of the poor in purse. Have the top of your table 
polished with a mixture of raw linseed oil and turpentine three 
parts of oil, one of turpentine rubbed in long and well. Then 
set for breakfast and for luncheon with a linen square embroid- 
ered or simply hemstitched laid diagonally to the table corners, 



FAMILIAR TALK 109 

in the middle, with doilies of the same under the plates ; a carv- 
ing-cloth before the master of the house, and a tray-cloth before 
the mistress. The effect is pleasing and decorative, the more 
agreeable to the housewifely eye because the weekly wash is ma- 
terially lessened thereby. 

If your table has not a polished top, you would better have for 
breakfast and luncheon one of the pretty colored lunch-cloths 
with napkins to match, which come in divers patterns and at 
varying prices. 

If your china-closets are insufficient to hold all your china, and 
especially if the walls of the room are ungracefully bare, run a 
shelf a foot wide near the ceiling and set in graceful array upon 
it some of your pretty and odd pieces. The device elevates them 
to the dignity of bric-a-brac, relieves the burdened closet shelves 
and produces a frieze-like effect that will further detract from 
the business-like look of the apartment. 

Tax your ingenuity in every way to make the place tempting 
to eye and to thought, as well as to appetite. A place where one 
is disposed to linger over one's meals for social converse and 
social enjoyment, instead of bolting food in hungry silence, pre- 
paratory to bolting from the place he calls "home," through cus- 
tom and courtesy, to return not until the approach of the next 
feeding time. 



BREAKFAST MEATS 

BREAKFAST BACON 

MRS. MARY J. LINCOLN than whom there is not a more 
trustworthy authority upon everything pertaining to cookery- 
says in a sprightly chapter upon breakfast bacon : 

"It has been offered me frequently in thick slices, swimming 
in grease, browned almost to blackness, and salt as the briny 
waves. You will seldom find a market-man who will take the 
time and pains to slice it as thin as it should be, even though 
they are supposed to have knives especially adapted for thin 
slicing. For that reason I prefer always to buy it by the strip, 
and slice it as needed. 

"With a strong, sharp knife, begin at one end, trim off the 
outside strip of lean, the smoked edges and the rind, down about 
three or four inches; then shave off in thinnest possible 
slices, as thin as can be cut, and have them whole. When you 
come to the rind, trim off more of it if more slices are needed. 
Some prefer to turn the strip over and slice from the lower side 
down to the rind, but not dividing from the rind until sufficient 
is sliced. But whichever way you do it, keep the strip entire 
that is, do not cut off three inches, or half a pound, and then 
trim and slice that amount, for the last slice will be quite diffi- 
cult to hold firmly enough to slice uniformly. 

"It can be cut thin much easier if very cold. By wrapping 
it securely in thick brown paper and changing the paper fre- 
quently, it may be kept in the refrigerator without affecting the 
other food. 

"Have a smooth frying-pan hot, and everything else ready. 
Lay in the bacon and turn it frequently as it changes to the 
transparent stage, moving it about so all portions will cook 

no 



BREAKFAST MEATS in 

equally. The heat should be sufficient to cook it quickly, but 
not to brown it. As soon as it loses the transparent appearance 
and begins to crisp, draw it from the liquid fat toward the edge, 
and you will soon tell by the way it dries off and the sound 
whether it is cooked enough to be crisp. 

"Tilt the pan so the fat will run down away from the bacon, 
and let it drain thoroughly in the pan. By watching and turn- 
ing it carefully, every piece will be of a uniform light and color, 
more or less curly, crisp as a Saratoga potato, and so dry and 
free from grease that it might be picked up with gloved fingers 
and leave no stain. 

"It is less likely to brown when a little of the fat from a pre- 
vious frying, or a bit of lard, is put in the pan first, as this keeps 
the bacon from sticking to the pan." 

I seldom borrow a recipe, for two reasons: First, because I 
have a few old-fashioned prejudices as to the rights of pro- 
prietorship in such products ; secondly, because, to be frank, I 
seldom find one upon which I think I could not improve in the 
matter of simplicity and directness. I could not write out more 
clearly my ideas on the subject of cutting and cooking breakfast 
bacon than my distinguished fellow-laborer has expressed them. 
I hereby grant her permission to honor me by abstracting the 
same number of words from any of my printed pages. 

Bacon and apples 

This is a favorite southern dish, and good enough to be trans- 
planted. 

Slice bacon thin and fry it crisp. Transfer to a platter and 
keep it hot while you fry thick slices of unpeeled sweet apples 
in the bacon fat. When these are tender, drain and put in the 
center of a hot platter. Lay the fried bacon about the edge of 
the dish, sprinkle sugar over the apples, and serve. 

Bacon and polenta 

Wet a cupful of fine Indian meal with two cupfuls of cold 
water and stir it into a quart of boiling water. Add a teaspoon- 



ii2 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ful of salt, beat up hard, and let it cook steadily for two hours, 
stirring up often to prevent lumping. Should it thicken too 
much, add boiling water. 

When done, pour out into a broad platter and set aside until 
perfectly cold and stiff. If you are to have it for breakfast, cook 
it over night. Cut in squares, triangles or rounds, roll in raw 
meal (salted), and fry in plenty of boiling dripping or cottolene 
or other fat to a delicate brown. As each piece is done, transfer 
to a hot colander to drain. Serve in the center of a hot dish, 
with thin slices of fried bacon laid about it. 

A pretty way of varying a plain but excellent dish is to pour 
the hot polenta into fancy molds wet with cold water, leaving 
it there until you are ready to cook it, when turn out and fry. 

Bacon and sweet peppers 

Cut the stem ends from green sweet peppers, handling very 
cautiously, lest the seeds should touch the walls of the peppers 
and make them "hot." With a small sharp knife extract core 
and seeds and throw them away. Cut the peppers into rings, 
lay in ice-cold water slightly salted for half an hour. Fry sliced 
bacon in a clean pan, take up and keep hot. Dry the peppers by 
patting between two clean cloths and fry until clear and tender 
in the fat left in the pan. Arrange the peppers in the center of a 
hot dish, the bacon around them. 

Barbecued ham 

Fry slices of cold boiled ham on both sides. Transfer to a 
hot dish. Cook together in a frying-pan four tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, a teaspoonful of granulated sugar, a teaspoonful of 
French mustard, and a dash of paprika. Stir until very hot and 
pour over the fried ham. If raw ham be used, cook for fifteen 
minutes in a frying-pan in boiling water to which has been added 
a tablespoonful of vinegar; lay in cold water for ten minutes, 
wipe dry and fry as directed.

Home-made sausages 

Grind in a sausage-mill or meat-chopper six pounds of lean, 
fresh pork and three pounds of fat. Mix with this twelve tea- 
spoonfuls of powdered sage, six, each, of black pepper and of 
salt, two teaspoonfuls, each, of ground cloves and of mace, and 
one nutmeg, grated. When the seasoning is well mixed with 
the meat, pack all down in stone jars and pour melted cottolene 
or other fat on top to exclude the air, or put into long- bags of 
stout muslin. Dip these in melted grease and hang in the cellar. 

They may be made in small quantities and used at once, and 
are much better than those we buy in market or shop, 



Sausages and apples 

Lay the sausages ("bulk sausage meat" is best) in a frying- 
pan, cover with hot water and bring quickly to a fast boil. At 
the end of five minutes pour off the water and fry on both sides, 
turning twice. Lift them, drain over the pan, and lay in a hot 
colander in the open oven, while you fry sliced and cored apples 
in the fat that ran from the sausages in frying. 

If you use link sausage, prick each before boiling. 

"Frankfurters" 

Cover with boiling water and boil slowly until they rise to the 
surface of the water. Drain and rub over with a mixture of but- 
ter, lemon juice and made mustard. 

Broiled pork chops 

Are too heavy as breakfast food for any stomach save that of 
a hod-carrier or ditcher. But people will eat them in the "kill- 
ing" season, and should have them properly cooked. 

Trim away the fat and the skin from the small end ; broil over 



ii4 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

clear coals, and thoroughly, for fear of trichinae. Pepper and salt 
to taste. Send around tomato catsup with them. 
Cutlets and spare-ribs are cooked in like manner. 

Curried pork cutlets 

Broil as in foregoing recipe and keep hot (covered) over boil- 
ing water. Heat a tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, and 
as soon as it hisses fry in it a tablespoonful of minced onion. 
When the onion has browned, strain it from the fat, return the 
latter to the pan, and pour in a cupful of boiling water, with half 
a cupful of apple sauce. Stir while it simmers for ten min- 
utes. Cook two minutes, and pour over the chops. Leave cov- 
ered in the oven for five minutes and serve. 

TRIPE 

A much-maligned article, meet for good men's tables. It is 
despised and set at naught by people who should know better, 
because it is rarely cooked daintily. At its proper estate under 
the hands of a cook who recognizes its real worth it is said to be 
both nourishing and digestible. It is certainly palatable, if ten- 
der and properly prepared. Buy from your butcher the pre- 
pared tripe that is, tripe which has been thoroughly cleaned and 
is ready for boiling. No matter how you intend to cook it, boil 
it first. 

Boiled tripe 

Lay the tripe in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Set 
at the side of the range, where it will come slowly to a boil, and 
simmer steadily for at least four hours. Drain, and set in a cool 
place until wanted. 

Stewed tripe 

Cook as in the preceding recipe, but cut the tripe in half-inch 
squares. At the end of four hours drain off all the water except 
a gill ; add to this a cup of stewed and strained tomatoes, a dash 
of onion juice, salt to taste and a pinch of paprika. Rub to- 



BREAKFAST MEATS 115 

gather a heaping teaspoonful, each, of butter and flour, and stir 
into the tripe mixture. Stir until the sauce is smooth and thick. 
Some persons like a teaspoonful of Parmesan cheese added to 
this stew just before it is served. 

Fried tripe 

Lay cold, boiled tripe in a mixture of equal parts of salad oil 
and vinegar for two hours. Drain in a colander for fifteen min- 
utes. Dip in egg, then in cracker crumbs, and set in a cold 
place for several hours. Saute in a frying-pan to a light brown. 

Or you may dip squares of cold boiled tripe 1 into good fritter 
batter and fry in deep cottolene or other fat. When done, drain 
free of grease and serve with a sauce made according to the fol- 
lowing recipe : 

Into the yolk of an egg beat very slowly, a few drops at a time, 
a half-cup of salad oil. When as thick and smooth as cream 
add, still slowly, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a coffeespoonful 
of French mustard, a tablespoonful of minced parsley and salt 
and paprika to taste. 

Stewed tripe and oysters 

Drop three dozen oysters into their boiling liquor, cook for 
just one minute, and drain. Cut cold boiled tripe into pieces of 
uniform size. Put it over the fire with enough water to cover 
it and simmer for three-quarters of an hour. Drain off the 
water. Have ready a pint of fresh, scalding milk in a double 
boiler and drop the tripe into this. Cook for fifteen minutes ; 
add two teaspoonfuls of flour rubbed into the same quantity of 
butter, and stir until smooth and thick. Season to taste, add the 
oysters and cook until they are heated through. Last of all, stir 
in very slowly one beaten egg, and remove at once from the fire. 

Stewed tripe and celery 

Cut into inch pieces enough celery to make a cupful, and stew 
tender in salted, boiling water. Drain and set aside while you 



ii6 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

stew the tripe, first in water, then in milk, as in the recipe for 
tripe and oysters. Instead of adding the oysters to the thickened 
milk, stir in the stewed celery, and cook for a minute before 
serving. 

BEEFSTEAK 

Rub the hot gridiron with a bit of suet before you lay the steak 
upon it. The fire should be clear and hot, and yourself at leisure 
to watch and to turn quickly when the meat begins to drip. 
There are houses in which a flavor of creosote would seem to be 
inseparable from a broiled steak. Turn swiftly to keep the 
smoke from it, and the juices in. Try with the point of a keen 
knife at the end of ten minutes. If the center of the steak be 
ruddy, and not purple, and the outside of a fine brown, it is done, 
ftemove to a hot platter, pepper and salt and butter well on both 
sides. Fit a close cover on the dish and set in the open oven for 
five minutes to draw the juices to the surface. 

Beefsteak with onions 

Cook as just directed. Have ready three tablespoonfuls of 
minced onions, cooked for five minutes in hot butter. They 
should be tender and clear, but not crisp. After the steak is 
dished spread the hot onion thickly over it, let it stand in the 
open oven, with a close cover over it, five minutes. 

Chateaubriand steak 

Broil a neatly-trimmed tenderloin steak, transfer to a hot dish, 
butter generously and cover with broiled mushrooms cut into 
quarters. 

Hamburg steaks 

Chop a pound of lean beef very fine, and stir into it a beaten 
egg, a teaspoonful of onion juice, salt and pepper to taste, and a 
pinch of mace. Mix well, mold into flat cakes, dredge with 
salted flour, set on the ice for an hour, roll again in flour, and 
saute in good dripping or butter. 



BREAKFAST MEATS 117 

Chilli con carni (No. 1) 
(A Mexican dish.) 

Beefsteak (round), one tablespoonful of hot dripping, two 
large red peppers (dry), two tablespoonfuls of rice, one-half pint 
of boiling water, salt, onions, flour. 

Cut steaks into small pieces. Put into a frying-pan with hot 
dripping, hot water and rice. Cover closely, and cook steadily 
until tender. Remove seeds and part of rind from red peppers. 
Cover with the chilli water, add garlic and thyme. Simmer until 
cold, then squeeze them in the hand until the water is thick and 
red. If not thick enough, add a little flour. Season with salt 
and a little onion if desired. Heat and pour sauce on the meat. 
Serve very hot. 

Chilli con carni (No. 2) 

Provide for it two pounds of steak, six red chillies, two cloves, 
one tablespoonful of flour, a little garlic, thyme, dripping. 
Seed the chillies and cover with boiling water. Soak until tender 
and then scrape the pulp into water. Cut steak in small pieces 
and fry brown in dripping or butter; add flour and brown it. 
Cover with the chilli water, add garlic and thyme. Simmer until 
the meat is tender and the gravy of the right consistency. 

Beef cakes 

Scrape round steak, season to taste with salt and pepper ; form 
with the hands into small, flat cakes and broil over a quick fire. 

Stew of beef's liver 

Cut one pound of liver into slices. Chop a quarter of a pound 
of fat salt pork. Spread a layer of the pork in the bottom of 
the inside kettle of a double boiler. Cover the pork with slices 
of liver, sprinkle this with a teaspoonful, each, of minced onion 
and parsley, add more pork, more liver, onion and parsley until 
all the ingredients are in the pot. As you do this, sprinkle each 



u8 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

layer lightly with pepper. Pour a half-pint of seasoned weak 
stock over all, cover the pot closely and keep the water in the 
outer pot at a gentle boil for two hours and a half. Now strain 
out the meat and keep hot while you return the gravy in the pot 
to the fire and thicken it with a brown roux. Boil up once and 
pour the gravy over the liver. 



KIDNEYS 

First of all, they must be perfectly fresh. If not, they have an 
odor, and a peculiar "tang" that the unfortunate eater never for- 
gets, and which causes him to feel an aversion for kidneys hence- 
forth and forever. Care should also be exercised in removing all 
bits of fat and gristle. Last of all, cook the kidneys in a savory 
way and spare no pains to make them appetizing. 

Brown stew of kidneys 

Split the kidneys, wash them, drain and cut into small pieces 
of uniform size. Pour cold water over these and set at the side 
of the range, where they will come slowly to a boil. Just before 
the boiling point is reached turn off the hot water, substitute cold, 
and bring to the boil. Drain the kidneys and keep them hot 
while you cook together a tablespoonful of browned flour and 
the same quantity of butter. When these are blended pour upon 
them a scant teacupful of salted boiling water, and stir until 
thick and smooth. Now add salt and pepper, a teaspoonful of 
kitchen bouquet, the same quantity of Worcestershire sauce, a 
half -teaspoonful of lemon juice and a tablespoonful of currant 
jelly. Turn the kidneys into this and stir until very hot. 

Savory kidneys 

Skin and slice three pairs of lambs' kidneys. Cut into halves 
fourteen canned mushrooms. Heat together a cup of bouillon 
and a half-cup of the liquor from a can of mushrooms. Cook 
together in a saucepan .a tablespoonful, each, of butter and 



BREAKFAST MEATS 119 

browned flour, and when these bubble pour upon them the bouil- 
lon and mushroom liquor. Stir to a thick sauce and add a tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce, the same quantity of tomato 
catsup, a half-teaspoonful of onion juice, salt to taste and a dash 
of paprika. Now stir in the mushrooms and sliced kidneys. 
Cook for five minutes after the boil is reached, stirring con- 
stantly. 

Fried kidneys 

Cut three pairs of lambs' kidneys into halves. Fry eight thin 
slices of bacon until done ; remove from the fire and keep hot 
while you fry the halved kidneys in the bacon fat. Cook slowly 
for ten minutes, turning often. Remove the kidneys and keep 
hot with the bacon while you stir a teaspoonful of Worcester- 
shire sauce and the same quantity of catsup into the gravy left in 
the pan. 

Put crustless slices of toasted bread on a platter, lay the kid- 
neys on these, pour the gravy over them and dispose the crisp 
slices of bacon about the edge of the platter. 

Broiled kidneys 

Cut the kidneys into thick slices. Melt a little butter and 
stir into it a saltspoonful of mustard and a dash of lemon juice. 
Dip each slice of kidney in this, roll in cracker dust, and set aside 
until this coating stiffens. A half-hour will be long enough. 
Broil on a small gridiron over a clear fire, turning often that 
the kidneys may not burn. Be sure they are thoroughly done. 
Serve very hot. 

Stewed kidneys 

Cut the kidneys in halves, remove all the fat and cover the 
kidneys with hot water, bring to the boil and drain. Cover with 
more hot water, again bring to the boil and drain. Repeat this 
process a third time. Remove them from the liquor, slice thin, 
and thicken the gravy with browned flour rubbed smooth with 
two teaspoonfuls of butter. Return the kidneys to the gravy, 



130 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

and when very hot add pepper, salt, two tablespoonfuls of mush- 
rooms, minced, two teaspoonfuls of Worcestershire sauce, a little 
lemon juice, and two tablespoonfuls of sherry. Serve imme- 
diately. 

Kidneys sautes 

Split the kidneys, trim off all fat and cut each kidney into 
quarters. Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan, 
sprinkle the kidneys with pepper and salt and roll each piece in 
flour before laying it in the frying-pan. Cook, turning often, 
until brown. Lay upon a hot platter and add to the grease in 
the pan x a wineglassful of sherry, a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
onion juice and a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup. Boil this 
sauce up once, and pour it over the kidneys. 

Kidneys a la brochette 

Split the kidneys, put over the fire in cold water, and bring to 
a rapid boil. Drain, wipe and slice each half. Cut the same 
number of thin slices of bacon the same size and freed from rind 
and hard lean. Arrange the bacon and kidney slices alternately 
on small skewers or stout straws, and broil them quickly. Send 
to table on the skewers. 



SWEETBREADS 

Said a maid to me once : "Indeed, mem, I niver see sich an- 
other as yersel' for cookin' wild things and innards !" 

The "wild things" to which she referred were quail, wood- 
cock and hare, while the "innards" of which she spoke with such 
scorn were sweetbreads, kidneys and brains. I may remark, 
en passant, that the lower classes seldom like viands most prized 
by the epicure, and the cooking of them, to be done properly, 
must be performed by the mistress not the maid unless the 
latter be an accomplished cook. 



BREAKFAST MEATS 121 

Broiled sweetbreads 

Wash a pair of sweetbreads, throw them in boiling salted 
water, and cook for ten minutes. Drain, and lay in iced water 
until thoroughly cold. This process is called "blanching" the 
sweetbreads, and should be done as soon as the perishable dain- 
ties are brought home from the butcher's. Wipe them dry, rub 
with butter, and broil them over a clear fire. Watch them that 
they do not scorch. When done, put them on a hot dish, pour 
a little melted butter over them, sprinkle lightly with salt and 
pepper and serve. 

Fried sweetbreads 

Blanch and split each sweetbread in half, lengthwise. Dip in 
beaten egg, roll in cracker crumbs, and set in a cold place for 
this coating to harden. At the end of an hour, fry in deep cotto- 
lene or other fat brought slowly to a fast boil. 

Broiled sweetbreads with mushrooms 

Blanch the sweetbreads and cut them in half, lengthwise. 
Grease a small gridiron, lay the split sweetbreads on this, and 
broil over a clear fire, turning frequently and watching carefully 
lest they scorch. When done, lay on rounds of crustless toast, 
rub thoroughly with butter, salt and pepper to taste, and cover 
with minced mushrooms fried in butter. 

Sweetbread cutlets 

Parboil, blanch and mince enough sweetbreads to make two 
cupfuls. Put into a saucepan with a little white stock and bring 
to a boil. Thicken with a white roux, and when smooth stir in 
gradually two beaten egg yolks ; then turn the mixture upon a 
dish to cool and stiffen. Form with floured hands into cutlets, 
arid fry in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat 



122 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 



Creamed sweetbreads 

Blanch and cut two pairs of sweetbreads into neat dice. Cook 
together in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls, each, of butter and 
flour, and pour upon them a pint of cream. Stir to a smooth 
sauce, add the sweetbreads and cook, stirring steadily until very 
hot. Season with salt, pepper, and a teaspoonful of minced 
parsley. 

LIVER 

It is not known to all housewives, even to those who practise 
economy from necessity or from choice sometimes from both 
that lamb's liver, which costs one-fourth as much as calf's liver, 
is quite as palatable some say better than the more expensive 
viand. The hint may be borne in mind in studying the follow- 
ing recipes. 

Liver and bacon 

Slice the liver, sprinkle each slice with salt and pepper, and 
roll in salted flour. Set on ice while you fry twice as many thin 
strips of bacon as you have slices of liver. Remove the bacon 
from the pan and lay in the floured liver. Fry slowly until done, 
turning often. It should cook for at least fifteen minutes. Drain 
the liver, holding each piece over the pan that the grease may 
drip off, and arrange on a heated platter, the bacon around it. 



Broiled liver en brochette 

Cut the bacon thin and the slices of liver into pieces of the 
same length and width. Run a wooden skewer or stout straw 
through each piece of liver and, alternately, through a slice of the 
bacon. Proceed in this way until each slice of bacon is fastened 
to a slice of liver, and each skewer is full. Lay on a broiler and 
broil over a clear fire. When done lay the liver and bacon, still 
skewered together, on a hot platter. 



BREAKFAST MEATS 



Tried liver 



123 



Cut the liver into strips half an inch wide and four inches long. 
Heat two tablespoonfuls of butter or dripping in a frying- 
pan and fry a sliced onion in it. Strain out the onion. Have 
ready the liver, peppered and salted and rolled in flour. Put 
this into the fat and cook, turning once. Take up the liver and 
keep hot over boiling water. Stir into the fat left in the pan 
two tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, one teaspoonful of kitchen 
bouquet, and a heaping teaspoonful of browned flour wet to a 
paste in cold water. Add salt and paprika to taste, boil up once, 
put in two tablespoonfuls of sherry and pour over the liver. 

There is no nicer way of cooking liver for breakfast. 

Mince of liver 

Chop, very fine, one pound of calf's liver. Put one table- 
spoonful of butter in a saucepan, add the liver with two table- 
spoonfuls of chopped bacon ; cover and cook gently for one hour. 
When nearly done add a half-teaspoonful of salt, a quarter-tea- 
spoonful of pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of boiling water. 
Serve on a platter upon buttered toast. 



CHICKEN 

Fried chicken 

Joint a tender chicken as for fricassee. Dip each piece in 
beaten egg, then roll in salted cracker dust until thoroughly 
coated. Set aside for an hour before frying in boiling cottolene 
or other fat to a golden brown. Be sure to fry long enough for 
the thickest pieces of chicken to be cooked all the way through. 

Virginia fried chicken 

Prepare the chicken as directed in the last recipe. Fry half 
a pound of bacon, sliced thin. When crisp, but not burned, 



MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

strain off the fat and return to the pan. Keep the bacon hot 
while you fry the chicken (prepared with egg and cracker dust) 
in the fat, turning twice. Should there not be fat enough, add 
dripping or cottolene or other fat. When done, arrange upon a 
hot dish and garnish with the bacon. 

Fried chicken with cream gravy 
(A Maryland dish.) 

After dishing the chicken cooked as in foregoing recipe, strain 
the fat again, stir in a lump of butter rolled in flour that has been 
slightly browned, and, when it bubbles, a small cup of hot cream 
or milk to which a pinch of soda has been added. Stir for two 
minutes to prevent scorching, add a tablespoonful of minced 
parsley and pour over the chicken. 

Broiled chicken 

Use none but undeniably young chickens for broiling. Clean 
well and split down the back. Lay for an hour in a marinade of 
salad oil and lemon juice, if there is any doubt on this point. 

If certain of your subject, wash over with butter and lay upon 
a greased and heated gridiron, breast uppermost. The fire should 
be red and strong. Broil about ten minutes to the pound, lifting 
when it begins to drip and turning four times to insure thorough 
cooking. When dished it should be sprinkled with pepper and 
salt and well buttered. 



SOME WAYS OF COOKING COLD CHICKEN 

Chicken fritters 

Cook a heaping tablespoonful of flour in one tablespoonful of 
hot butter and one cup of chicken stock, added gradually. Sea- 
son with celery salt and pepper and pour half of this sauce into 
a small, shallow, buttered pan. Chop one cupful of cold chicken 



BREAKFAST MEATS 125 

quite fine, season and spread it evenly over the top of the sauce 
after it has thickened. Cover with the remainder of the sauce, 
place on ice, and when very cold and hard cut into rounds or 
squares. Dip them quickly into batter and fry in deep, hot cotto- 
lene or other fat, or in clarified chicken dripping. 

These should be prepared over nig^\ The fritters will keep 
their shape if left a long time before the paste is cut up. 

Chicken omelet 

Beat four eggs very light, season with salt and pour into a 
greased frying-pan. Have ready a cupful of minced chicken 
(heated) and a pint of hot white sauce in which a tablespoonful 
of minced parsley has been stirred. When the omelet is "set" 
and ready to be removed from the pan, sprinkle over it the 
minced chicken, fold it over and transfer to a hot platter. Pour 
the white sauce about the omelet. 



Chicken mince on the half -shell 

Cut fine sweet peppers in half lengthwise; remove core and 
seeds, taking care not to touch the sides of the peppers, and soak 
for an hour in cold water slightly salted. 

Mince fine the cold meat of a chicken and add it to one-fourth 
as much fine crumbs as you have chicken; moisten with gravy 
or sauce ; fill the peppers, sprinkle fine crumbs over the top, dot 
with bits of butter, bake half an hour covered, then brown. 

Creamed chicken 

Make a white roux of two tablespoonfuls of butter and half as 
much flour ; when it bubbles add a cupful of cold chicken cut into 
dice, a teaspoonful of onion juice, salt and pepper to taste and 
enough stock to keep all from burning. Cook for ten minutes be- 
fore stirring in two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine and a cup of 
rich milk heated with a pinch of soda stirred in.

Imitation terrapin 

Proceed as directed in last recipe, adding at the last, the 
juice of half a lemon and a glass of sherry. Boil up and serve 
at once. 

Turkey croquettes 

Mince enough cold roast turkey to make two cupfuls, season 
with salt, pepper and a half pint of oyster liquor. Put into a sauce- 
pan and make scalding hot. Thicken a cupful of hot milk with a 
tablespoonful of white roux, stir it into the turkey mince, and 
when the boiling point is reached remove it from the fire. When 
cold and stiff form into croquettes, crumb these and set on the 
ice for two hours before frying to a golden brown in deep, boil- 
ing cottolene or other fat, or in clarified chicken drippings, if you 
have it. 

Turkey scallops 

Mince remnants of cold turkey rather coarsely and mix with it 
one-third as much stuffing or bread crumbs. Moisten with 
gravy, oyster liquor or stock, season well; fill scallop shells or 
pate pans with the mixture, cover with fine crumbs, with dots 
of butter over all and bake in a quick oven. 

Stewed calf-brains 

Heat a great spoonful of butter in the frying-pan and when 
hot, stir in a tablespoonful of flour. Add a gill of cream with salt 
and pepper, chopped parsley and a teaspoonful of kitchen bou- 
quet. Put a pinch of soda into the cream. When heated, put in the 
brains, which have been previously blanched and cut into large 
dice. Cook ten minutes, stirring constantly, and serve hot.

Barbecued lambs' tongues 

Open a can of lambs' tongues and spread on a platter. Sprinkle 
with salt, pepper and a little onion juice. Lay in a sauce made 
by stirring together three tablespoonfuls of salad oil and one of 
vinegar. Let them stand in this mixture over night. In the 
morning heat a little butter in the frying-pan, lay the tongues in 
this and saut&, turning often. 

Mince of mutton 

Chop the meat fine, removing bits of fat and gristle. Season 
with salt, pepper and a little onion juice. (It is always better to 
grate, than to slice onions for seasoning.) Mix with the minced 
meat one-fifth of its bulk of fine bread crumbs wet with the gravy 
and work in the beaten yolk of a raw egg to "bind" the mixture. 
Mold into flat cakes, dip these into a beaten raw egg, then in 
cracker crumbs and set in a cold place over night. Fry quickly, 
as you would doughnuts, in deep cottolene or other fat (never in 
lard) made very hot. Take up as soon as they are done, drain off 
every drop of fat and lay upon rounds of lightly browned toast 
in a heated dish. Garnish with sprigs of parsley. 

Minced mutton and tomato toast 

Make three cups of good well-seasoned tomato sauce, thickened 
with a heaping teaspoonful of flour rubbed into one of butter. 
Keep hot in a double boiler set at the side of the range. 

Toast slices of bread, butter them, spread on a platter and put 
a tablespoonful of tomato sauce on each. Into the remainder 
of the tomato sauce turn two cupfuls of minced mutton, put the 
saucepan over the fire, stir until the meat is thoroughly heated, 
season to taste and pour upon the toast.

it. Broil the steak, turning frequently over a fire of clear coals. 
As it is better rare, do not cook the venison too long. When done 
lay the meat upon a hot platter, put upon it several spoonfuls of 
butter and a little currant jelly, cover and set in the oven long- 
enough to melt the butter and to soften the jelly, then send im- 
mediately to the table. 

Broiled quails and woodcock 

Clean and split down the back. Wash carefully and dry inside 
and out with a clean cloth. Leave on ice half an hour and broil 
over a clear hot fire. Dish, pepper and salt, put a piece of butter 
upon, and lay under each bird a round of delicate toast. 

Small birds 
Can be cooked in the same way. 



BREAKFAST VEGETABLES 



Stewed potatoes 

PARE the potatoes and cut into small dice. Cook tender in 
boiling water, salted. When clear, but not broken, turn off the 
water and cover with hot milk into which you have stirred a lump 
of butter rolled in flour. Simmer for ten minutes, add a table- 
spoonful of finely-minced parsley, boil up once and serve. 

Hashed potatoes, browned (No. 1) 

Cook as in last recipe, but when ready for the milk turn the 
stewed potatoes into a buttered pudding dish, cover with the 
milk, butter and flour and bake, covered, half an hour. Then un- 
cover and brown. 

This dish is particularly good if a little onion juice and about 
a tablespoonful of minced celery be mixed with the potatoes just 
before they are put into the bake-dish. The dice should be very 
small. 

Hashed potatoes, creamed and browned (No. 2) 

Cut a dozen cold boiled potatoes into very small dice. Thicken 
a cupful of hot milk with a tablespoonful of flour, rubbed into one 
of butter. Season to taste and stir the potato dice into this sauce. 
Stir for just a minute ; turn into a greased baking-dish and brown 
in a good oven. 

Lyonnaise potatoes 

Cut a dozen cold boiled potatoes into dice of uniform size. 
Shred two onions very thin and put them into a frying-pan with 
two tablespoonfuls of butter. Fry the onion to a light brown; 



132 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

add the potatoes and fry until delicately colored, stirring fre- 
quently. Strew with chopped parsley and serve. 



Potato croquettes 

Into a pint of hot mashed potatoes stir a* tablespoonful of but- 
ter, a beaten egg, salt and pepper and enough cream to make the 
potatoes of the proper consistency to be formed into croquettes. 
Roll in egg and cracker crumbs and set in the ice-box for an hour 
before frying in deep cottolene or other fat to a light brown. 
Drain in a hot colander. 

Potato omelet 

Beat two cupfuls of mashed potatoes to a cream with milk, salt 
and pepper and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Beat three 
eggs light and whip them into the potato mixture. Have a but- 
tered frying-pan heated, turn the omelet into this and cook until 
set ; turn out upon a hot platter. 



Chopped potatoes sautes 

Chop cold boiled potatoes evenly and rather coarsely. Put a 
tablespoonful of butter or of good dripping into a frying-pan and 
when hot stir the potato-dice into it, tossing and shaking until 
they are smoking hot. Pepper and salt and dish. 

An equal quantity of sweet potato dice mixed with the white 
will make the dish still better. 



Potatoes fried whole 

Boil potatoes of uniform size until just done. Sprinkle with 
salt. When cold roll in beaten egg and cracker crumbs and 
set in a cold place for an hour. Fry in deep, boiling cottolene or 
other fat, or in dripping to a golden brown. 



BREAKFAST VEGETABLES 133 

Fried green peppers 

Slice green peppers crosswise and remove the seeds and tough, 
white membrane. Melt a little butter in the frying-pan and fry 
the sliced peppers in this. They are an appetizing accompani- 
ment to fried fish. 

Stuffed peppers 

Mince enough cold chicken to make a cupful and stir into it two 
tablespoonfuls of minced ham and one of melted butter. Season 
to taste. Cut the stems from green peppers so that they will 
stand upright. Cut off the tops of the peppers, remove the seeds 
and membrane and fill with the minced chicken and ham. Stand 
the peppers on end in a baking-pan, pour about them a cup of 
chicken stock and bake half an hour. 

German potato pancakes 

Six large raw potatoes grated fine; three eggs; a scant tea- 
spoonful of soda ; salt to taste. Mix as pancake dough and fry 
in plenty of cottolene or other fat previously heated gradually 
to a boil. 

Fried eggplant 

Cut the eggplant into slices nearly three-quarters of an inch 
thick, peel these and lay them in a bowl of cold, salted water, 
putting a plate on them to keep them under the surface of the 
liquid. At the end of an hour remove the vegetables from the 
water and wipe dry on a clean cloth. Dip each slice in beaten 
egg, then in cracker crumbs and lay on a platter. Set in the ice- 
box for an hour and fry to a golden brown in deep boiling cotto- 
lene or other fat. Drain in a colander lined with tissue paper and 
pile on a folded napkin on a hot platter. 

Broiled eggplant 

Cut the eggplant in slices half an inch thick, peel and leave 
for an hour in cold, salted water, as in the preceding recipe. 



134 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Wipe the slices dry and lay in a bath of five tablespoonfuls of 
salad oil and two teaspoonfuls of vinegar. At the end of fifteen 
minutes remove the eggplant, drain in a colander, sprinkle each 
slice with salt and pepper, lay on a gridiron and broil over a clear 
fire. Cook for five minutes on one side before turning the broiler. 
Serve very hot. 

Pried ripe tomatoes 

Cut firm tomatoes into thick slices, but do not peel them. 
Sprinkle each slice with salt, dip into a beaten egg and then in fine 
cracker dust. Set in a cold place for an hour and fry in boiling 
cottolene or other fat, or in butter. 

Broiled ripe tomatoes (No. 1) 

Cut large* firm tomatoes into half-inch slices, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and dip in fine bread crumbs. Put into a greased 
broiler and broil over a clear fire until heated thoroughly. Spread 
with soft butter and serve at once. 

Broiled tomatoes (No. 2) 

Wash and wipe ripe tomatoes. With a very sharp knife cut 
them in half and lay, skin side down, upon a buttered broiler. 
Cook over a clear fire until done; arrange squares of toast on a 
hot platter and lay the broiled tomatoes on this toast half a 
tomato to each slice. Handle carefully that they may not break. 
Sprinkle with pepper and salt and pour melted butter over all. 

Grilled tomatoes 

Cut large, firm tomatoes into thick slices. Do not peel. Rub 
an oyster broiler lightly with butter, lay on it the slices of tomato 
and broil over a clear fire. Have ready a sauce made by working 
a teaspoonful, each, of minced parsley and of lemon juice into 
two tablespoonfuls of butter. Sprinkle the tomatoes with pepper 
and salt, put the sauce on them, let them stand covered in the 



BREAKFAST VEGETABLES 135 

open oven or plate-warmer for a couple of minutes, or until the 
butter is melted, and serve. 

Tomatoes and bacon 

Prepare tomatoes as in the preceding recipe, omitting the sauce. 
Keep them hot while you broil or fry thin slices of bacon to a 
delicate crisp. Arrange the tomatoes on a dish, lay a slice or two 
of the bacon on each piece of the tomato and serve. This is an 
excellent breakfast dish. 

If for any reason it is not convenient to broil the tomatoes, 
they may be fried in butter or in olive oil, drained dry and served 
in the same fashion. 

Broiled green tomatoes 

Cut the unpeeled tomatoes into half-inch slices and lay in sweet 
oil for five minutes. Transfer the slices carefully to a fine wire 
broiler and cook to a delicate brown. When done, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, lay on slices of crisp toast and pour a white sauce 
over and around all. 

Fried green tomatoes 

Wipe green tomatoes with a damp cloth, cut them into slices 
half an inch thick, dip in beaten egg and cracker crumbs, set in 
the ice-chest for half an hour and then fry in butter to a delicate 
brown. Drain from grease and serve on a hot platter. 

Broiled mushrooms 

Peel, lay upon a buttered broiler and cook over clear coals, al- 
lowing three minutes to each side of the mushrooms. Transfer 
to thin slices of crustless toast, put a bit of butter and a dash of 
salt and paprika on each mushroom and set in an oven just long 
enough to melt the butter. 

Fried mushrooms 

Melt a great spoonful of butter in an agate frying-pan. Peel 
the mushrooms and cut off their stems, scraping these last. Lay 



136 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the mushrooms with their scraped stalks in the frying-pan and 
cook, turning often, until done. Serve very hot. 

Green pepper toast 

Slice bread thin, cut off the crusts and toast on both sides to a 
delicate brown, then butter and keep hot in the oven. Heat a 
cup of beef stock in the saucepan. Rub together a tablespoonful 
of butter and the same quantity of browned flour and stir it into 
the beef stock. When you have a very thick brown sauce add 
salt to taste and a half cupful of green peppers which have been 
seeded, freed from the tough white core and minced very fine. 
Stir to a paste, remove from the fire and spread upon the slices 
of hot toast. Set in the oven ' long enough to become very hot 
and crisp, and serve. 

Fried hominy 

Warm three cups of cold boiled hominy by setting the vessel 
containing it in an outer vessel of boiling water. When hot, add 
a saltspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of melted butter, beat 
the hominy smooth and turn into small muffin-tins to get cold and 
to form. When very stiff, turn the forms over, roll each in 
beaten egg and cracker dust and set all in a cold place for an 
hour. Fry in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. 

Block potatoes 
(Contributed) 

Cut raw potatoes in cubes. Wipe them dry and fry in deep fat 
until a light brown. Salt, drain on brown paper and serve hot. 



FAMILIAR TALK 

WITH MARTHA IN HER KITCHEN 

(Time The cook's "afternoon out.") 

IT is the Christian duty of every housemother in this comfort- 
loving land to provide a commodious, well-appointed kitchen and 
laundry, where daily household work is done, and clean, airy, com- 
fortable chambers for workers, where they may take rest in sleep 
when that work is over. I should fail in observance of the Golden 
Rule if I were to oblige them to work where I could not w^rk, 
or to sleep where slumber would be an impossibility to me. 

My own preference for a kitchen floor-covering is really good 
linoleum of conventional design and light in color, therefore 
cheerful in effect. Many housewives insist upon oiled hardwood 
or painted floors. Not one cook in twenty takes proper care of 
an oiled floor, and paint soon wears off. It is economical to buy 
a prime quality of linoleum, and to lay the same pattern on 
kitchen, laundry and hall. When it wears out in one room it can 
be replaced from another. Inlaid linoleum will last for years. 

Thick, strong rugs should be laid before the range and by the 
tables, one under the table at which the servants eat. Linoleum is 
cold to the feet, and one takes cold readily when over-heated. 

I read, last year, that kitchen tables are now, as "a taking nov- 
elty," covered with zinc. Over a score or years ago I covered 
what may be called the work-tables in my kitchen with this useful 
metal, tacking it neatly under the edges, lest a loose point might 
tear hands or clothes. I have kept it up ever since. The table- 
tops are cleaned easily ; they never "take" grease or stain of any 
kind, and they outwear wood by many years. 

Another invaluable invention which I wish I could place in 

137 



138 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

every kitchen is a sheet-iron hood and asbestos curtain, fitted to 
the top of the recess enclosing the range. It works so easily upon 
pulleys that a little finger could pull it down. When raised, it is 
entirely out of the cook's way ; when down, it shuts in the range 
like an impervious screen. Sliding doors in the center allow 
one to look into pots and kettles simmering behind it, when over- 
sight is advisable. If left closed, it will lower the temperature of 
the kitchen twenty degrees within two hours. It cost twenty 
dollars when new, twelve years ago. If I could not get another, 
twelve hundred dollars would not buy it. 

I long ago discarded the old-fashioned tin and iron cooking 
utensils in favor of agate-nickel-steel ware, which is as easily 
washed as crockery bowls and plates ; is light and neat in appear- 
ance ; never rusts, and is altogether satisfactory. All of my ket- 
tles have covers, and we use covered roasters another boon to 
housewives for cooking meats. They keep in flavor and juices, 
and lessen the labor of basting. 

Always have a rocking-chair convenient into which the cook can 
drop for rest between the times of active duty, and one apiece 
for maids in the laundry. For yourself, follow the rule I laid 
down imperatively a quarter-century ago in COMMON SENSE IN 
THE HOUSEHOLD "Never stand at your work when you can 
sit." A chair suited in height to the mixing table will save you 
many an ache in the feet, back and head. 

Do not allow servants to jumble their table crockery, etc., up 
with pots, saucepans, kettles, colanders and the like. There is no 
reason why the dresser or closet in which the kitchen tableware 
is kept should not be as daintily arranged as the dining-room 
buffet. It should hold no commerce with the pot closet. 

The servants' chambers must be furnished with iron bedsteads, 
good mattresses, plenty of clean blankets and white spreads. The 
"honeycomb" spreads are absurdly cheap and easily washed. The 
rest of the appointments of the dormitories need not be elaborate. 
If they are neat and comfortable the occupants are more likely 
to try and make them attractive. When one pins up a crucifix 
over her bed, her mother's or sister's photograph against the wall, 
or even a colored lithograph of a patent medicine notice it pleas-

antly. It means that she is catching the home feeling. Muslin 
curtains cost next to nothing. Hang them up at her window; 
give her a pretty cover for her bureau-top and a plain one for her 
washstand, and plenty of towels. The Golden Rule works well 
here where does it not ? 

I read a little story many, many years ago before you were 
born, I think a slight, commonplace affair, that has furnished 
two generations of busy housewives with a hard-worked mot 
de famille. 

Excuse the foreign phrase! We have none in English that 
exactly translates it. "Household word" comes nearer to it than 
anything else, without quite covering it. 

The tale was of a fidgety housekeeper of the sort stigmatized 
in the rough parlance of the sensible vulgar as "nasty particular." 
A friend, calling upon her soon after breakfast, found her fairly 
beside herself with worry because guests she had expected at noon 
had telegraphed that they would be with her at eleven o'clock that 
morning. Distracted Martha "could never in the world be ready 
for them. There was so much to do that she did not know what 
to take hold of first. It was enough to drive a woman out of her 
senses," etc., etc., etc. 

"But what have you to do ?" 

"Do! Do! Do! Why everything !" 

The visitor drew off her gloves. 

"I will stay and help you. Shan't I get the spare room ready ?" 

A gesture of disdain. 

"As if I would have put that off until today !" 

"Can I help about luncheon ?" 

"Well ! I should be ashamed of myself if the cook hadn't her 
orders and materials and all before this !" 

"Perhaps I could dust the parlors? or polish silver? or 
glancing around the perfectly appointed dining-room, where the 
luncheon table was already laid "I might arrange the flowers in 
the vases?" 

It finally transpired that the frantic and "forehanded" hostess 
could specify but one thing that remained to be done before every- 
thing should be in order for the visitors. She had "butter-balls 



140 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

to make for luncheon. She always kept the paddles in ice-water 
for hours beforehand." 

I was young then and read the little story aloud to my mother 
a woman blessed with a keen sense of humor and as keen a per- 
ception of the fitness of things. She adopted the phrase on the 
spot. "Butter-balls to make" became with us the synonym for 
needless hurry and flurry and worry. When used interrogatively, 
it was the cabalistic formula that caused a precipitate and a settle- 
ment of many a muddy whirl of anxieties, the open sesame to a 
"chamber the name of which was Peace." 

Half of the perturbations that chase the housemother "clean out 
of her wits" are as purely imaginary as those that beset the her- 
oine of our wee scrap of a story. That other American Martha 
who cried out on Monday morning : "Washing to-day ! Ironing on 
Tuesday ! Baking on Wednesday ! Bless my life, half the week 
gone and nothing done!" is hardly a caricature of the national 
housewife. Worry is a whirlwind that throws the weightier 
matters of the law of life out of plumb, and raises such a dust of 
minor duties and possible hindrances that the blinded victim can 
see nothing aright. 

One of the fixed principles of the universe is that two objects 
can not occupy the same place at the same time. Another, which 
we are more slow to admit, is that no two duties are cast for one 
and the same instant. The throngs of homely tasks that obscure 
our toiler's vision in the anticipation of "another day's work," 
drifting and dancing in the light of the new day a flood of 
elusive moths have really sequence and order. Let her take 
hold of her astral or inner self, by the shoulders, and hold her 
steady until she can weigh and classify the importunate atoms. 
The pretty fairy-tale of the tasks set for Graciosa by her wicked 
stepmother supplies another and a pat illustration. The poor girl 
had to sort a roomful of feathers of all colors and sizes. After 
laboring vainly for hours, she called tearfully for her fairy lover, 
who, with one stroke of his wand, laid each kind in a separate 
heap from the rest. 

Your wand and my wand dear Martha, is the cool, long 
breath of sober reflection that gives us time to say: "All these 



RANGE-SCREEN LOWERED TO SHUT IN HEAT 




FAMILIAR TALK 141 

things can not be done at once. Some of the less important can 
be laid over into the convenient season which must fall into the 
lot of even an American housekeeper. I must keep each in its 
place. I will" a strong "will," a long "will," and many "wills" 
altogether "I will think of but one thing at a time, and do it 
as if there were nothing else in the world for me to do." 

The discipline of thought and nerves that must attend upon 
such a moral and mental effort will train lawless impulses and 
teach concentration of thought as well as the much-vaunted 
higher mathematics could. Work need not, of necessity, be 
worry. Industry does not imply haste. 

"Count five and twenty, Tattycoram !" entreated Mr. Meagles, 
when the foundling's temper was likely to get away from her. 

In the same tone of affectionate warning, I pass on my homely 
test of facts and values "Butter-balls to make!" First, make 
sure of what you really have to do, and to do today. Secondly, 
having screened and sifted the mass, assort the ore before you be- 
gin to smelt it and yourself ! 

In place of counting five and twenty, accept my formula 
"Draw ten deep breaths" before you make up your mind that you 
have not time for one. 

The world is full of fresh air and it owes us all we can take in 
leisurely and thankfully. 

No matter how heavy your burdens, your experience reflects 
'that of hundreds of others. It may be a mean kind of misery 
that loves company. The knowledge that others are fighting 
and toiling bravely along the same line with ourselves; that 
others have conquered the circumstances which oppose us, braces 
us for renewed effort. What woman has done, woman may do 
again. 

You are far from being hopelessly "mired ;" you have what is 
called "a good fighting chance" for life and usefulness. You 
have one tremendous advantage, a solid foothold to begin with, in 
the certainty that you are in the right path. 

The confident assurance of this is half the battle. The other 
half is in doing your work as it comes to your hand. Don't cul- 
tivate "a long reach," It never pays. You "don't get ahead one 



142 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

inch." Perhaps God means for you to move by quarter-inches. 
He has ten thousand ways of disciplining His children, and so 
teaching them to make the very best of themselves. It is as cer- 
tain as that He rules the heavens, that He knows just what sort 
of training is good for you. Your husband, your children, your 
home, are your working capital, a loan from Him your talents, 
if you like that figure better. They are more than worth all the 
labor and the worries that fall into your lot. 

Husband, children, home, work and worry fill to-day full. 
Hence the folly, "and the danger, and the sin of "the long reach." 
The one coming guest whom you should never welcome is to-mor- 
row's possible troubles. The children are not to be educated to- 
day, nor is John ill or dead at the present moment, and the "lone- 
some" maid does not go until her month is up. The faith that 
removes mountains wears short-sighted glasses and brings them 
to bear upon the work in hand. 

This is not preaching, but practical philosophy. Try how it 
will work for a week then a month then a year. 

Keep your house as well as you can for John, for the babies, 
for yourself, and let the neighbors run theirs to suit themselves. 
Comparisons, according to Dogberry, are "odorous." Compari- 
son of this sort savors of discontent and trouble. Mind your own 
business and take your business in sections. 

"Magnify your office." You are as important in your king- 
dom as the Queen of Great Britain and the Empress of the' 
Indias was in hers, and have not one worry where she had a 
thousand. 

Lastly, read in full the text relating to the "bread of careful- 
ness." Look it up and take it as the application of my lay- 
sermon. 



THE FAMILY LUNCHEON 

FIFTY years ago luncheon expressed the most desultory and 
haphazard meal possible to enlightened humanity. School children 
carried lunch-boxes and parcels in the corners of book-bags when 
they left home after breakfast. Picnic, berrying and nutting 
parties stowed away bountiful luncheons in baskets and hampers. 
There were three meals a day, breakfast, dinner and supper, or in 
New England, tea. Households in which people sat down, even 
upon "occasions," to a luncheon set forth in orderly fashion upon 
a table, to be eaten in courses with knives and forks, were as 
few as those in which afternoon tea was served. 

The change that, by pushing the dinner hour nearer the close of 
day has made expedient, if not needful, a substantial noon-day 
meal, has come about naturally and gradually. The down-town 
of men workers and the up-town of homes have receded from 
each other until the head of the house can no longer spare time to 
dine at home at midday. And the stately sequence of soup, fish, 
meat and sweets is a tedious sham when there are no men to be 
cooked for. In the country the increasing army of commuters have 
but two meals at home during the week day. Wives, compassion- 
ately reminiscent of the hasty bit and sup that stays their stomachs 
during a day's shopping, assume that the respective Johns fare no 
better. John's breakfast is a touch-and-go affair. He shall have 
abundant recompense for that and the wretched sandwich and 
lukewarm coffee that mocked fainting Nature at the noon spell. 

By these and others stages luncheon has become an American 
institution, and has come to stay. It is, to most women, the pleas- 
antest meal of the day, even when partaken of at home, with 
none present but "the children" and the grown women of the 
household. It breaks up the monotony of daily tasks; it is eaten 

143 



144 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

without flurry or hurry, because with little ceremony. "Pick-up" 
dishes and accidental entrees figure conspicuously in the menu, 
things for which men, as a rule, care little and their wives and 
daughters much. Tea and toast, cake and preserves can be en- 
joyed without fear of bantering comment, and a harmless disli 
of gossip can be uncovered without provoking severe strictures. 
The Ladies' Luncheon, which has grown into one of the most 
important of modern social functions, will be considered later. 



LUNCHEON DISHES 

OYSTERS 

Fricasseed oysters 

Drain the liquor from a quart of oysters and bring 1 to the boil- 
ing point. Stir into it two tablespoonfuls of cracker crumbs 
rolled very fine. Set at the side of the range while you scald a 
half pint of cream in which you have dissolved a tiny pinch of 
soda. Meanwhile melt three tablespoonfuls of butter in a sauce- 
pan and cook the oysters in this until their edges "ruffle," when 
they must be removed and laid on tiny slices of toast on a hot 
water dish. Turn the melted butter remaining in the saucepan 
into the oyster liquor and pour this slowly, stirring all the time, 
on the hot cream, season with salt and paprika, and pour immedi- 
ately over the oysters and toast. 

Deviled oyster pate's 

Drain the liquor from a quart of oysters. Chop the oysters and 
mix with them a cup of cracker crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter and enough oyster liquor to soften the whole. 
Season with salt, paprika and a few drops of Tabasco sauce, with 
a teaspoonful of tomato catsup. Butter small pate-pans, fill 
these with the mixture, sprinkle cracker crumbs on top, and bake. 

Creamed oysters 

Drain the liquor from a quart of oysters. 
Cook together three tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour, 
and when they bubble pour upon them a cupful of oyster liquor 
10 145 



146 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

and a cupful of rich milk (cream is better), in which you have 
dropped a bit of soda the size of a pea. Stir until the sauce 
thickens, then turn into it the oysters. Cook until the oysters are 
heated through; add, a few drops at a time, the beaten yolks of 
two eggs, keeping your spoon moving all the time. Do not allow 
it to cook a minute after the last drop of egg is added. 

Broiled oysters (No. 1) 

There are several methods of broiling oysters. For all of them 
a good large oyster is needed. I give the simplest method first. 

Dry your oysters on a towel ; sprinkle them with salt and a 
little red pepper and lay them within an oyster-broiler. Turn 
them so that they may brown on both sides, put them on a hot 
dish, dress at once with butter, and serve as soon as this has 
melted. 

Broiled oysters (No. 2) 

Drain and dry your oysters, sprinkle them with salt and pepper 
and roll them in bread-crumbs. Broil them over a clear fire, turn- 
ing them until they are brown. Serve on buttered toast. Put a 
bit of butter on each oyster and squeeze on it a few drops of 
lemon juice. 

Broiled oysters with brown sauce 

Sprinkle large drained oysters with salt and pepper, dip in 
beaten egg, then, roll in cracker-dust, and lay on the ice for an hour 
before cooking upon an oyster-broiler over a clear fire to a delicate 
brown. Put on a hot platter and cover with a brown sauce. 

Brown sauce for broiled oysters 

Cook together a scant tablespoon ful, each, of butter and 
browned flour ; pour upon a half pint of cleared consomme ; sea- 
son with salt, pepper, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, a little 
mushroom catsup and a few drops of kitchen bouquet. Add a 
dash of lemon' juice and serve. 



LUNCHEON DISHES 147 

Scalloped oysters 

Drain the oysters and dispose in a buttered bake-dish in the 
following order : 

In the bottom have a light layer of crushed cracker crumbs ; 
season with paprika and salt, drop bits of butter upon them and 
wet with oyster liquor and milk mixed in equal quantities. Now 
comes a layer of oysters, similarly seasoned, next a layer of 
crumbs. Go on thus until the dish is full or the materials are 
used up. The top layer should be crumbs with a double allow- 
ance of butter. Cover closely and bake half an hour, then uncover 
and brown lightly. 

Oyster scallops 

Prepare as above, but bake in pate-pans or in shells, covering 
each with fine crumbs. In tide-water Virginia, notably near Wil- 
liamsburg, the first capital of the state, large, fluted shells are 
dug up many feet below the surface, which, when cleaned, make 
the best possible receptacle for scalloped oysters. All who have 
eaten fresh oysters, just from York river, cooked in these fossil 
remains, will agree with me that they are incomparably savory. 

Send sliced lemon around with them. 

Fried oysters 

They must be large, plump and fresh. Drain well ; spread upon 
a clean, soft towel, and cover with another, patting them gently 
to dry them on both sides. Roll each over and over in salted 
cracker-crumbs; set on the ice for an hour; dust more crumbs 
over them, and fry, a few at a time, in boiling hot butter, cotto- 
lene or other fats. 

Drain, garnish with parsley and serve. 

Oysters creamed and baked 

Heat a large spoonful of butter in a clean frying-pan, rub in a 
tablespoonful of flour, and stir to a white roux. Remove to the 
table. Season with salt and white pepper. Have ready pate-pans 



148 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

or scallop-shells arranged in a baking-pan ; put three or four fine 
oysters in each, cover with the white sauce and cook in a quick 
oven about eight minutes, or until the oysters "ruffle." Serve in 
the shells. The white sauce should be thick, as the liquor from 
the oysters will thin it. 

Stewed oysters 

Drain in a colander one quart of oysters. Put the liquor over 
the fire in a saucepan, with a good tablespoonful of butter. Add 
half as much boiling water as you have liquor, pepper and salt to 
taste, and bring to a boil. As soon as this is reached, put in the 
drained oysters and cook quickly. When they "ruffle" in five 
minutes or thereabouts add half a cupful of milk heated in an- 
other vessel with a tiny bit of soda to prevent curdling, and half 
a teaspoonful of corn-starch wet with cold milk, stirred in. Pour 
upon the oysters, cook for one minute and dish. 

Most stewed oysters are cooked into insipid toughness. 

Oyster stew 

Heat the liquor from a quart of oysters to boiling. While it is 
growing hot put over the fire in another vessel a pint of milk. 
When this is heated stir into it a tablespoonful of butter rolled 
in as much flour. Drop the oysters into the hot liquid and let 
them cook until they ruffle. Pour the milk into the saucepan 
with the oysters, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve. 

This is the old-fashioned stew and is better than many more 
modern inventions. 

Oysters fried in batter 

Make a rather thick batter of one egg, a cupful of milk and 
about half a cupful of flour, sifted twice, with a scant half tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder and half as much salt. Drain fine 
oysters, roll each in flour, let them stand half an hour, then dip 
in the batter and fry in boiling butter, cottolene or other fat. 
Drain off every drop of grease in a hot colander and serve.

Steamed oysters 

Wash shell oysters and arrange, flat side up, in the steamer. 
Cover closely, and set over water at a hard boil. In twenty-five 
minutes lift the steamer from the fire. If the shells gape, the 
oysters are done. Pry off the lower shell, put a bit of butter on 
each, and send at once to table. Pass salt and pepper and sliced 
lemon with them. They are delicious if eaten piping hot, pre- 
serving the flavor far better than stewed or panned oysters can 
hold it. 

Panned oysters 

Fit rounds of buttered toast into the bottom of pate pans ; lay 
on these as many oysters as the pans will hold, season with salt 
and pepper, lay a dot of butter upon each panful and set in your 
covered roaster to cook in a quick oven about ten minutes, or 
until the oysters "ruffle." Serve in the pans. 

An appetizing luncheon or supper dish. 

i 
Creamed panned oysters 

Cook as in last recipe, and when the oysters are done add to 
each pan a large teaspoonful of cream heated to scalding, putting 
in a tiny pinch of soda to prevent curdling. 

Instead of the cream you may make a dish of 

Deviled panned oysters 

When ready for the table add to each pan a dozen drops of 
Tabasco sauce, stirred into a saltspoonful of French mustard 
and the same quantity of lemon juice. Beat together, stir lightly 
into the oysters with a fork, heat one minute and serve. 

Curried oysters 

Into two tablespoonfuls of white roux stir a few drops of onion 
juice and a teaspoonful of curry powder. Add a cupful of scald- 
ing oyster liquor, and, when well incorporated, pour over broiled 



150 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

or fried oysters laid upon toast in a chafing-dish. Rice croquettes 
are nice served with this dish. 

Oyster pie or pat6s 

Make pastry shells or a pie shell of puff paste, bake, and when 
cold, fill with a filling made thus : Cook together a tablespoonful, 
each, of butter and flour ; pour on them a cup of cream and a gill 
of oyster liquor and stir to a smooth sauce. Drop in the oysters 
and cook, stirring steadily until the edges begin to curl ; remove 
from the fire and beat in gradually the yolk of an egg. Pour into 
the pastry shells and set in the oven until the pastry and contents 
are very hot. 

Oyster cocktails (No. 1) 

Into a tablespoonful of tomato catsup stir a half tablespoonful 
of grated horseradish, a half tablespoonful of Worcestershire 
sauce, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, a quarter teaspoonful of 
Tabasco sauce, half a tablespoonful of vinegar and a saltspoon- 
f ul of salt. Set in the ice for an hour. Into very cold little 
glasses put five small oysters that have been chilled, and fill the 
glasses with the cold sauce. 

Oyster cocktails (No. 2) 

For six of these provide thirty small oysters. Make a sauce by 
mixing together a tablespoonful, each, of lemon juice and tomato 
catsup, a teaspoonful of grated horseradish, a pinch, each, of salt 
and cayenne pepper and six drops of Tabasco sauce. Have all 
very cold, and the cocktail or claret glasses thoroughly chilled 
before you put five oysters in each and divide the sauce equally 
between them. Lay a slice of lemon on top of each cocktail. 

Oysters with mushrooms 

(Contributed) 

Drain about twenty-five oysters, put them into a hot pan with a 
teaspoonful of butter and toss them until they are plumped and 



LUNCHEON DISHES 151 

ruffled on both sides. Then place them in a hot dish. To the 
oyster liquor add the juice of half a pint of chopped mushrooms 
and enough milk to make a pint. Thicken this with a tablespoon- 
ful of flour moistened with a little milk and cook three minutes ; 
stir in the mushrooms and cook two minutes longer ; add a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a half teaspoonful of lemon juice, a teaspoon- 
ful of onion juice, the beaten yolks of two eggs and a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter. Put in the oysters and as soon as the 
preparation reaches the boiling point turn into a hot dish. 

Pigs in blankets 

(Contributed) 

Take large oysters and allow them to remain in the following 
dressing: The juice of two lemons, half a teaspoonful of salt and 
a dash of cayenne pepper. Now wrap each oyster in a thin slice 
of bacon and fasten with a toothpick, fry in a little butter until 
the bacon is crisp. Have nicely browned slices of toast and lay 
the oysters on them. Garnish with parsley and serve. 

Baked oysters 

(Contributed) 

Select nice large oysters. Wash and scrub the shells free from 
sand. Put them into a baking-pan and bake in a hot oven until 
the shells open. Carefully remove the upper shell ; put a bit of 
butter on each oyster, sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve 
in the under shells. 

Oysters with macaroni 

(Contributed) 

Put about four ounces of macaroni in plenty of boiling salted 
water and cook for twenty minutes. Take out and drain well. 
Into a buttered baking-dish put a layer of the macaroni, then a 
layer of oysters, dot with bits of butter, season with pepper and 
salt ; follow this with another layer of macaroni, another of ovs- 



152 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ters and seasoning, and finish with a layer of macaroni sprinkled 
thickly with grated cheese. Bake in a moderate oven twenty 
minutes. 

Oysters sautes 

Drain the oysters well, season with pepper and salt, roll in fine 
bread crumbs, and brown in a little clarified butter in a spider. 
Serve on a hot platter. 

Scalloped clams 

Select one dozen large clams in the shell and two dozen soft 
ones. Use care not to injure the shells which are to be used in 
cooking. Clean the shells well and put two soft clams into each 
one. Add to each a touch of wiMte pepper and one and a half tea- 
spoonfuls of minced celery. Cut into small dice a few slices of 
bacon and add four of these to each shell ; sprinkle bread crumbs 
over the top, put a piece of butter on top of each and bake in the 
oven till brown. 

Roast clams 

Wash the clams and lay them unopened in a bake-pan, and set 
on the top of the very hot range. Cook until the shells open wide, 
then remove the upper shell and transfer the lower with the 
clam and juice still in it to a hot platter. Squeeze upon each 
clam a few drops of lemon juice and serve in the shells. Pass 
tomato catsup or chili sauce with them. 



Creamed clams 

Drain the liquor from a pint of opened clams, and set the clams 
and liquor on the range in separate double boilers to heat. Cook 
together a large tablespoonful of butter and the same of flour 
until they bubble, then pour upon them the heated liquor and 
cook until smooth and thick. Have ready in another vessel a 
pint of hot cream, in which a pinch of soda has been dissolved. 
Pour this gradually upon a beaten egg, and return to the fire for 



LUNCHEON DISHES 153 

a minute, stirring constantly. Add the chopped and heated clams 
to the thickened liquor, season with paprika, stir gradually into 
the hot eggs and cream, and pour upon squares of lightly but- 
tered toast. 

Clam pates 

Drain the liquor from a quart of clams. Cook together a table- 
spoonful of butter and one of flour, and pour upon them a cup of 
hot milk (in which a pinch of soda has been dissolved) and a 
cup of clam liquor. Stew until you have a smooth, thick sauce, 
and then add the chopped clams. Add a beaten egg, drop by 
drop, and when well mixed remove from the fire, season and set 
aside to cool. Line pate pans with good puff paste, fill with the 
clam mixture, put pastry over the tops and bake to a light brown. 
Serve hot. 

Deviled clams (No. 1) 

Steam in the shell as you have been told how to steam oysters. 
When they gape, open, saving all the liquor in a bowl. Cut off 
the dark end of each clam and set aside while you strain the liquor 
and bring it quickly to a boil. Season with paprika, butter, lemon 
juice and a few drops of Tabasco sauce; put in the clams and as 
soon as they are smoking hot, turn into a heated covered dish. 
Send around buttered bars of graham bread, or strips of buttered 
toast, or hot crackers, buttered lightly. 

Deviled clams (No. 2) 

Take two dozen clams from the shells, drain and chop. Scald a 
cup of rich milk and thicken it with two tablespoonfuls of flour 
rubbed into one of butter; remove from the fire, add gradually 
the beaten yolks of three eggs, paprika and celery salt to taste, 
a few drops of lemon juice and the chopped clams. Wash the 
clam shells, fill with this mixture, and set in a pan in the oven for 
ten minutes. Serve very hot/

Lobster la Newburg 

Stir a pinch of baking soda into a pint of cream ; put this, the 
beaten yolks of three eggs, and a wineglassful of sherry in a 
double boiler and cook, stirring, until thick. Now add a pint of 
lobster meat, seasoned with salt and cayenne, and stir until smok- 
ing hot ; then serve. 

Lobster timbales 

Mix together a cup of cold boiled lobster, minced very fine, 
eight blanched and chopped almonds, and season with celery salt 
and white pepper. Stir in a half pint of whipped cream and 
the whites of four eggs beaten very stiff and work in an ordinary 
Hollandaise sauce. Turn into timbale molds and bake. 

Lobster cutlets 

Two cupfuls of minced lobster seasoned with a quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt, a dash of paprika, and one teaspoonful, each, of 
lemon juice and minced parsley. Moisten with one cup of thick 
drawn butter and the beaten yolk of one egg. When cool, shape 
into cutlets ; egg and crumb them, let them stand for one hour on 
ice, then fry in deep, hot butter. 

Creamed lobster 

Two cups of boiled lobster meat, cut into dice. Season with 
paprika, salt and lemon juice. Heat a great spoonful of butter in 
a saucepan and turn in the lobster dice. Toss until smoking hot, 
add half a cup of cream, heated (with a bit of soda), then beat into 
it the whipped yolks of three eggs. Stir for one minute, and dish. 

Send hot, buttered crackers around with it. 

Curry of lobster 

Heat a tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, and cook in it a 
tablespoonful of sliced onion. Strain out the onion, return the 
butter to the pan, and stir to a roux with a level tablespoonful of 



LUNCHEON DISHES 155 

flour and a teaspoonful of curry powder. Add four tablespoonfuls 
of cream, heated (not forgetting the pinch of soda) ; lastly two 
cupfuls of lobster meat, cut into dice. Stir steadily until very hot, 
and dish. 

Note 

All of these preparations of lobster may be made with canned 
lobster, although they must always be inferior in flavor to those 
made from the fresh fish. If canned lobster be used, drain oft 
every drop of the liquor and have the meat as dry as possible be- 
fore it goes into the manufacture of the proposed dish. 

Scalloped lobsters 
(Contributed) 

Cover the bottom of a baking-dish with fine bread-crumbs. On 
this put a layer of lobster and season with pepper and salt; add 
another layer of crumbs, another of lobster and so on, until the 
dish is filled. Moisten with milk, strew with bits of butter and 
bake about twenty minutes. 

Deviled lobster 

Two cups of lobster meat, cut into dice. Reserve the coral, 
rubbing it to a paste with butter and lemon juice. Heat two 
tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan, add the lobster meat high- 
ly seasoned with paprika, French mustard, ten drops of Tabasco, 
or double the quantity of Worcestershire sauce and salt. As 
soon as it bubbles turn in the coral paste and let it just come to a 
boil before serving. 

Deviled crab 

Pick the meat from boiled crabs, taking care not to break the 
shells. Flake the meat and mix with it a tablespoonful of melted 
butter, cayenne and salt to taste and a tablespoonful- of lemon 
juice. Return to the shells, sprinkle with bread crumbs and bits 
of butter, and bake. 



156 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Crabs and champignons 

Two cupfuls of crab meat, cut into dice, and half a can of cham- 
pignons (mushrooms), cut into dice of the same size. Make a 
roux in a frying-pan of two tablespoonfuls of butter and one 
heaping tablespoonful of flour, stirred until smooth. Mix the 
crab meat and champignons well together, season with paprika, 
salt and a dash of onion juice ; turn into the smoking roux; cook 
three minutes ; remove from the fire ; add quickly three table- 
spoonfuls of cream, heated, with a pinch of soda; set over the 
fire for one minute, add a glass of sherry, and serve hot. 

Lobsters cooked in this way, substituting the fresh mushrooms 
for the canned, are delicious. 

Crabs en coquille (No. 1) 

Two cupfuls of crab meat, cut into neat dice, and set on ice un- 
til needed. One heaping tablespoonful of flour and an even 
tablespoonful of butter. Four tablespoonfuls of cream. Salt, 
cayenne, ten drops of Tabasco sauce or twice as much Worces- 
tershire. A little boiling water. Pinch of soda in the cream. 

Make a roux of butter and flour. Season the crab meat and 
stir into the roux, thinning with just enough boiling water to 
make the mixture manageable. When smoking-hot, take from 
the fire, beat in the hot cream and fill crab shells with the paste, 
rounding to suit the shape of the shell. Sift fine crumbs, salted 
and peppered, over each, put bits of butter on top, and brown on 
the upper grating of the oven. 

Crabs en coquille (No. 2) 

(A Cuban dish.) 

Prepare as directed in foregoing recipe, but mix with the crab 
meat the pulp of three tomatoes, cut into bits and drained dry, a 
green pepper, seeded and minced, and four tablespoonfuls of the 
inside of an eggplant (boiled and cold), cut small ; also half a cup 
of fine bread (not cracker) crumbs. Season with paprika, salt,

and a teaspoonful of onion juice. Stir into the roux over the 
fire, adding a little boiling water if too thick, until very hot, when 
remove to a table and beat in the whipped yolks of two eggs. Fill 
your crab shells, sift fine crumbs on top, dot with butter and cook, 
covered, ten minutes before browning upon the upper grating. 



SHRIMPS 

THE wee shell-fish are comparatively little known in many parts 
of the United States except as they come in cans. Even in this 
shape they lend themselves to many pleasing combinations con- 
venient for luncheons and picnics. 

Open the cans several hours before they are to be used, turn 
out the contents into an open bowl, rinse in cold water, drain and 
set on ice, or in some very cold place. 

Buttered shrimps 

Heat two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan; add a tea- 
spoonful of flour, and, when bubbling hot, a tablespoonful of to- 
mato sauce, paprika and salt to taste, and a teaspoonful of onion 
juice. Boil one minute and add a can of shrimps, washed and 
drained. Stir the mixture four minutes over a brisk fire and 
serve. 

Pass thin slices of buttered brown bread with them. 

Shrimps en coquille 

Prepare as directed on preceding page, in crabs en coquille, No. 
i. They are very good. 

Scallop of shrimps and mushrooms 

Cook precisely as in recipe on preceding page, for crabs and 
champignons. 

Curried shrimps 

Make a roux of one heaping tablespoonful of butter and a little 
less flour ; thin with one small cupful of boiling water ; add an 



158 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

even tablespoonful of best curry powder and one teaspoonful of 
onion juice. Stir for one minute and add a can of shrimps, 
washed and drained. Cook five minutes and serve. 

Shrimps and eggs 
( A Cuban dish.) 

Make a roux of one large tablespoonful of butter and one of 
flour; when it bubbles add a teaspoonful of onion juice and twice 
as much green sweet pepper, minced fine, with salt and a salt- 
spoonful of sugar. Boil up and stir in a can of shrimps, pre- 
viously washed and drained. Cook for five minutes ; remove to the 
table and mix in gradually, stirring all the time, four eggs which 
have been beaten just enough to break the yolks , Return to the 
fire and stir until the eggs begin to "set." 

Maryland terrapin 

Boil the terrapin until the skin on the claws is sufficiently soft 
to rub off at the slightest touch. Take from the shell, and re- 
move every particle of entrails and lungs. Place the meat in a 
chafing-dish. Add butter, pepper and salt, the quantity of each 
depending on the quantity of flesh. Let it simmer until the es- 
sence and butter reach the consistency of light gravy. Serve hot. 
If desired, add a little good sherry while eating, but not while 
cooking. Use no spices, dressing or other ingredients that can 
detract from the flavor. 



SARDINES 

THE adaptability of the sardine to a variety of preparations that 
are appetizing and delicious is not generally recognized by the 
housekeeper. The tiny fish may be used as the foundation of 
many nice, light dishes, and during the heated months form a 
pleasing variety upon the heavier lunch or supper dishes com- 
posed of meat. It is always well to open a box of sardines an 



LUNCHEON DISHES 159 

hour or two before the contents are to be used. Drain the fish 
from the oil in which they are packed, as this is too rich to be 
digestible, and does not improve the flavor of the fish. In buy- 
ing sardines, choose the more expensive quality rather than the 
cheap, so-called sardines, which are often only American minnows 
packed down in oil. 

Baked sardines 

Toast crustless slices of graham bread and butter them. Put 
the drained sardines on a tin plate, squeeze over them a few drops 
of lemon juice and sprinkle with fine cracker crumbs. Set the 
plate in the oven and bake the fish for ten minutes. Transfer the 
sardines to the toast, and keep hot while you make the following 
sauce : 

Strain a half-pint of liquor from a can of tomatoes and put it 
into a porcelain-lined saucepan to heat. Rub together a teaspoon- 
ful of butter and one of flour, stir these into the tomato liquor, 
and, as the sauce thickens, add a half-teaspoonful of onion juice 
and a teaspoonful of granulated sugar, salt and pepper to taste. 
Boil up once and pour over the sardines and toast. 

You may, if you like, substitute white bread for brown, and 
omit the tomato sauce entirely. 

Broiled sardines 

Drain the sardines free from oil and lay them on a fine oyster- 
broiler. Broil over a clear fire for five minutes. Butter heated 
saltine wafers, and lay a sardine on each of these. Squeeze four 
drops of lemon juice and two drops of onion juice on each fish 
and send to the table very hot. 

Canapes of sardines 

Cut thin bread into crescents or triangles. The crescent is tHe 
true canape shape. Toast the bread. Flake sardines fine with a 
fork ; work into them a teaspoonful of melted butter, a teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice, a pinch of salt and four or five drops of Ta- 



160 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

basco sauce. Spread the toast first with butter, then with the sar- 
dine mixture, place on a tin plate, cover, and set in the oven until 
very hot. 

Grilled sardines 

Cut as many strips of bread as you have sardines, making each 
piece a little longer and broader than the fish. Toast or fry 
these. Roll your sardines in egg and then in fine cracker crumbs, 
and fry to a light brown. Lay a sardine on each strip of toast 
and garnish with lemon and parsley. 

Sardine eggs (cold) 

Boil six eggs hard and throw into cold water. Remove the 
shells and cut the eggs in halves, removing the yolks. Pound 
these yolks to a paste with a tablespoonful of salad oil, and work 
into this paste eight skinned and minced sardines. Now add a 
teaspoonful of lemon juice, and a saltspoonful, each, of salt, pep- 
per and mustard. Form into balls, and fit these into the halved 
whites of the eggs, trimming off the bottoms of the whites so 
that they will stand on end. Serve garnished with water-cress, 
and with or without a mayonnaise dressing. 

Sardine eggs (hot) 

After making out the "eggs" as directed in foregoing recipe, 
put into a saucepan with a broad bottom and closely fitting lid, and 
set in a pot of water at a hard boil on the range. Do not let the 
water get into the inner vessel. In twenty minutes they should 
be heated through. Transfer to a hot dish and pour over them 
a hot Bearnaise sauce. (See Sauces.) 

Sardines in cups 

Cut rounds of stale bread more than half an inch thick. Press 
a smaller cutter inside of the larger round half way through the 
bread. Scrape out the crumb from the inner round, leaving 
sides and bottom whole. Set upon the upper grating of a hot 



LUNCHEON DISHES 161 

oven until crisped to a light brown. Turn and toast the bottom 
of the cups ; then butter well. Skin and behead eight sardines. 
Scrape to a smooth pulp and mix with this sauce : 

Make a roux of a large tablespoonful of butter and nearly as 
much flour, thin with a few spoonfuls of boiling water, season 
with a teaspoonful of anchovy paste and one of Worcestershire 
sauce ; stir in the sardine pulp, and when it begins to bubble fill 
the buttered bread cups, which should have been kept hot. Send 
around sliced lemon with them. 

Anchovies an lit 

Toast thin rounds of bread ; butter and cover thickly with the 
yolks of hard-boiled eggs, run through the vegetable press. Make 
a hollow in the mass of powdered egg and lay a curled anchovy in 
the little pit thus formed. 

Set in a hot oven for five minutes, and serve. 

Anchovy toast 

Cut the crust from slices of bread and toast to a light brown. 
Butter lightly, and spread with anchovy paste. Lay the toast 
upon a hot platter in the oven while you make a sauce by cooking 
together a tablespoonful of butter and the same quantity of 
browned flour, and when they are blended pouring upon them 
a pint of beef stock. Stir to a smooth, brown sauce, add a tea- 
spoonful of kitchen bouquet, six stoned and chopped olives, pep- 
per to taste, and a very little salt. Pour this sauce over and 
around the anchovy toast. 

Anchovy croutons 

Cut white bread into three-inch triangles, and fry them in but- 
ter to a pale brown. Drain, and spread each lightly with anchovy 
paste, and on this lay a slice of tomato. Dust with salt and pep- 
per and serve cold,

162 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Caviar in saucers 

Prepare rounds of bread as directed for "Sardines in Cups," 
and keep hot while you make the filling thus : 

Two tablespoonfuls of caviar, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of curry powder, and the same of paprika. 
Put all into a saucepan over the fire and stir until quite hot ; then 
put it into the hot and crisped "saucers." 

Caviar strips 

Cut an equal number of slices of brown and of white bread 
quite thin and butter on one side. Trim into neat oblongs and 
spread the white bread with caviar. Fit a brown strip over each 
piece thus prepared, press lightly and firmly together, and lay, 
log-cabin-wise, in a tray lined with a doily. 

A curry of salmon 

Open a can of salmon two hours before using, and remove all 
bits of skin and bone. Pour two tablespoonfuls of olive oil into 
a frying-pan and fry in it a minced onion. When the onion is 
brown stir into the oil a tablespoonful of flour mixed with a tea- 
spoonful of curry powder, and when these are blended add a large 
coffee-cupful of boiling water. Season and stir for a moment, 
and turn the salmon into the mixture. Cook for two minutes and 
serve. Pass sliced lemon with this dish. 

Salmon mayonnaise 

Have boiling in a kettle a gallon of salted water to which a gill 
of vinegar has been added. Lay carefully in this two salmon 
steaks and let them boil very slowly. Test with a silver fork, and 
when done, but not at all broken, lift carefully from the water and 
drain. Set aside until cool, then keep on the ice until wanted. 
Lay the steaks on a cold platter and pour a very thick mayon- 
naise over them. Spread this smooth with a knife that the steaks 
may be covered. Garnish with an abundance of water-cress. 



LUNCHEON DISHES 163 

Scallop of salmon 

Open a can of salmon several hours before it is needed. Re- 
move all bits of skin and bone, and flake the fish into small pieces. 
Make a white sauce and stir the salmon into this. Pour into a 
buttered pudding-dish, cover thickly with bread crumbs and bits 
of butter, and bake. 

Beauregard cod i 

Boil a pound of cod the day before it is needed and let it get 
cold. Flake to pieces with a silver fork, removing all bits of 
skin and bone. Next day heat a pint of fresh milk in a double 
boiler, thicken this with a teaspoonful of flour rubbed into one of 
butter, and stir in the flaked fish. Season to taste and cook for 
five minutes. Turn upon squares of buttered toast. Have ready 
four hard-boiled eggs, the yolks powdered, the whites cut into 
rings. Sprinkle the yellow powder over the fish and lay the 
white rings about the edge of the platter. 

Baked smelts with oyster forcemeat 

Choose fine, large smelts of uniform size. Clean, wash and 
wipe, and fill them with a forcemeat made of one part fine 
crumbs, three parts finely-minced oysters, seasoned with paprika, 
a little minced parsley, salt and a tablespoonful of melted butter 
to a cupful of the forcemeat. Sew the fish up with fine thread 
and long stitches ; lay in your covered roaster with a little boiling 
water under the grating and bake twenty minutes, basting once 
with butter when nearly done. Serve with lemon sauce. 

They make a delicious fish course for luncheon. The threads 
should be clipped carefully that the fish may not be torn as they 
are drawn out before serving. 

Baked smelts 

Clean, wipe, roll in melted butter, then in cracker dust, set on 
ice to stiffen for an hour, and cook fifteen minutes in your cov- 
ered roaster. Send sliced lemon around with this dish.

Creamed shad 

(Contributed) 

Make a white sauce by cooking together a tablespoonful of but- 
ter and a heaping one of flour, and, when they are blended, pour- 
ing upon them a pint of unskimmed milk. Add a few drops of 
onion juice, then pour slowly upon the beaten yolks of two eggs. 
Season with salt, pepper and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. 
Into this sauce stir a pint of cold, cooked shad that has been freed 
of bones and flaked very fine. Turn into a greased pudding-dish, 
sprinkle with crumbs and bake for twenty minutes or until heated 
through. 

A "pick-up" of fish 

This is a good dish for Saturday when you are gathering up 
left-overs to clear decks for the Sunday which is to begin the new 
week. 

A cupful of cold, cooked fish cod, halibut, salmon or any other 
firm fish; the same quantity of cold, cooked macaroni, cut into 
small bits; half a cupful of tomato sauce, one cupful of oyster 
liquor, which any fish dealer will give you ; a heaping tablespoon- 
ful of butter and the same of flour, a teaspoonful of onion juice 
and the same of minced parsley. Salt and paprika to taste. 

Heat the butter in a saucepan ; stir in the flour, and, when it 
bubbles, the tomato sauce, the oyster liquor and the seasoning. 
Boil up once, add fish and macaroni; heat to a bubble without 
stirring, and turn into a deep dish. 

Fish scallop 

Prepare as above, but instead of stewing turri*all into a buttered 
pudding-dish as soon as macaroni and fish are added to the hot 
sauce ; strew crumbs on top, stick bits of butter over it and bake, 
covered, half an hour. Then brown. 



LUNCHEON DISHLS 165 

Baked chowder 

Fry a small sliced onion in a large spoonful of butter ; strain and 
return butter to the frying-pan. Have ready two pounds of cod 
or other firm fish cut into inch squares ; put into the hot butter and 
toss and turn until they are well coated ; pack the fish in a buttered 
bake-dish alternately with slices of parboiled potatoes, fat salt 
pork, minced fine (about half a pound in all), bits of butter rolled 
in flour, minced parsley and two tomatoes chopped. Season a 
large cupful of oyster liquor with paprika and salt, and pour over 
all. Cover with split Boston crackers that have been soaked in 
milk for half an hour, fit on a lid and bake, covered, one hour. 
Then brown. A savory family dish. 

A "Cape Cod folks" tid-bit 

Soak two pounds of salt cod over night. In the morning wash 
and scrub it with a whisk to remove lingering crystals of salt and 
cover with hot water in which an onion has been boiled. Let it 
stand in this until the water is cold. Take out the fish and lay 
between two towels until perfectly dry. Broil then on both sides, 
turning twice ; lay it in a hot water dish ; break to pieces with a 
fork, and cover well with hot drawn butter, seasoned with pepper, 
lemon juice and minced parsley. Let it stand (covered) for ten 
minutes over the hot water before serving, and you will be sur- 
prised by the excellent dish contrived of such homely materials. 

Halibut and cheese scallop 

Have ready two cupfuls (less, if you happen not to have as 
much) of cold, cooked halibut, flaked rather coarsely with a fork. 
Make a good white sauce drawn butter based upon milk instead 
of water. Butter a bake-dish and fill it with alternate layers of 
the fish, sauce and grated cheese (very mild), using altogether 
about four tablespoonfuls of the latter, and cover the top with 
crumbs. Bake half an hour in a quick oven, and serve hot. 
Keep covered until ten minutes before serving, when brown. 



i66 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Deviled halibut or cod 

Pick cold, cooked fish into bits with a silver fork. Make a 
forcemeat of bread-crumbs, the yolks of two eggs run through 
colander or vegetable press, a tablespoonful of melted butter, one 
of minced parsley, a teaspoonful of onion juice, paprika and salt. 
Mix with the fish, wet up with oyster liquor and fill scallop shells 
with the mixture. Cover with fine crumbs, pepper and salt them, 
put a dot of butter upon each scallop and bake quickly to a light 
brown. 

EGGS 

Curried eggs 

Boil seven eggs hard and throw into cold water to loosen the 
shells. Remove these without tearing or breaking the eggs, and 
cut round in slices nearly half an inch thick. Have ready in a 
saucepan a large cup of gravy from which the fat has been re- 
moved. Chicken gravy or stock is especially nice for this pur- 
pose. Season well with a teaspoonful of onion juice, half a cup- 
ful of strained tomato sauce, with pepper and salt. Boil up, 
thicken with two tablespoonfuls of browned flour and a teaspoon- 
ful of curry powder, and simmer together three minutes. 

Arrange the sliced eggs upon a chafing-dish or hot-water dish, 
pour the curry sauce over them ; set in the hot oven for three or 
four minutes, covered, to get heated through, and send to table 
in the hot-water dish. 

Serve boiled rice with it. 

Banana toast 

Is a pleasing accompaniment to curried eggs. 

Remove the crust from graham bread and cut it into thin 
slices. Spread one piece with thin slices of banana and lay an- 
other slice of bread upon this. Press the two pieces together that 
they may not fall apart, and toast quickly to a light brown. Keep 
hot in the oven until wanted, as these sandwiches are not good 
when cold. 



LUNCHEON DISHES 167 

Egg timbales 

Beat six eggs light and stir into them a half-pint of rich milk, 
a pinch of soda and salt and white pepper to taste. Pour into 
greased muffin-pans ; set these in an outer pan of boiling water, 
and Ipake until the egg is "set." Turn the timbales out upon a 
platter and pour a rich brown sauce around them. 

Baked omelet 

Break five eggs, the whites and yolks separately. Soak the 
crumbs of a slice of white bread in a half-cupful of milk for ten 
minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs thoroughly and whip the 
whites stiff. Stir the bread and milk into the yolks, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of white pepper, and stir in 
the whites of the eggs lightly just enough to mix them. Turn 
into a well-greased pudding-dish and bake in a quick oven. Do 
not let the omelet crust over too quickly, but put a piece of paper 
over the top for a few minutes. Uncover and brown. 

Deviled eggs 

Boil a dozen eggs hard, throw into cold water, and at the end 
of half an hour remove the shells. Cut the eggs carefully in 
half, extract the yolks and rub these to a paste with three table- 
spoonfuls of salad oil, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a half-tea- 
spoonful of made mustard, a dash of paprika, two or three drops 
of Tabasco sauce, and salt to taste. Form this paste into balls, 
put the balls back into the halved whites and fit the whites into 
place. Run a wooden toothpick through the two halves of each 
egg to hold them together. Wrap every egg in waxed or tissue 
paper to keep it from becoming dry. Eat cold, with or without 
mayonnaise dressing. 

Omelets caches 

Wash and wipe six large, smooth tomatoes of uniform size. 
Cut a piece from the blossom end of each and lay aside. Scoop 
out the pulp carefully, not to break the walls of the tomato. Set 



i68 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

together in an open pudding-dish and put this into a brisk oven 
until the tomatoes are smoking-hot, but not until they break and 
collapse. Have ready the pulp you have extracted, minced and 
stewed, seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, a little onion juice and 
sugar. Drain off most of the juice. Beat four eggs light, add 
four tablespoonfuls of cream, a tablespoonful of butter heated to 
a roux with one of flour, mix quickly with three tablespoonfuls 
of the drained tomato, and fill the tomato shells with them. Fit 
on the tops and set in a shallow pan upon the top grating of a 
quick oven. Five minutes should cook them. Slip a spatula un- 
der each tomato, transfer to a hot platter and serve at once. 
Pass thin slices of brown bread with them. 

Chicken or turkey timbales 

Boil eight eggs very hard and leave them in cold water for 
two or more hours. Take the shells off, cut in half, and extract 
the yolks. Chop the whites before running them through a veg- 
etable press. Now mix with them four heaping tablespoonfuls 
of the breast of chicken or turkey minced as finely as possible ; 
season with half a teaspoonful of onion juice, paprika and celery 
salt to taste, and mix to a white paste with the whites of three 
eggs beaten to a standing froth. Have ready enough buttered 
"nappies" or pate pans to hold the mixture ; fill them, set in a pan 
of hot water and bake twenty minutes in a quick oven. 

Turn out upon a hot platter ; pour a good white sauce about the 
base, heap a teaspoonful of the powdered yolks on the top of each 
and serve. 

The yolks are prepared by running through a colander or, bet- 
ter still, a vegetable press. 

Scallop of chicken and eggs 

Strew fine, dry, buttered crumbs over the bottom of a buttered 
baking-dish, then put in a layer of cold, cooked chicken cut into 
small dice. Cook a teaspoonful of chopped onion in a tablespoon- 
ful of butter till slightly colored, add a cupful of milk, and when 



LUNCHEON DISHES 169 

hot stir in half a cupful of dry bread-crumbs. Add a teaspoonful 
of chopped parsley and a little salt and paprika. Let it cool until 
blood-warm, then stir in two well-beaten eggs, and pour the mix- 
ture over the meat. Cover with fine crumbs. Place in the oven 
and bake, covered, half an hour. Serve in the dish in which 
it is baked. 

A savory mince 

Use any cold meat you have left over, except beef poultry, 
lamb, veal, mutton, will do and a little ham chopped and mixed 
with the other meat. Add one-third bread-crumbs soaked in 
stock or gravy and season well. Stir in a saucepan until very 
hot. Prepare "cups" of stale bread by cutting round, then with 
a smaller cutter marking out an inner circle, from which scrape 
out the bread, leaving bottom and sides whole. Dip these in a raw, 
sugarless custard made of a cupful of milk and two beaten eggs, 
and let each absorb all it will hold. Fry in hot cottolene or other 
fat to a light brown, drain, fill with the mince, which should be 
quite soft, drop a raw egg upon each, and set in the oven until 
the egg is "set." 

Larded sweetbreads (roasted) 

Blanch the sweetbreads. With a sharp skewer make holes 
in them and run through these openings narrow strips of salt 
pork. Let the bits of pork project half an inch on each side. 
Lay the sweetbreads in a covered roaster, pour about them a pint 
of cleared and seasoned soup stock, cover closely and cook for an 
hour, then transfer to a hot dish. Thicken the gravy in the pan, 
season and pour it about the sweetbreads. 

Larded sweetbreads (fried) 

Prepare as in the last recipe, but instead of roasting dip in egg, 
then in crumbs ; set on ice for an hour and fry in boiling butter. 



170 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Sweetbread pate's 

Make shells of rich puff paste, bake them, and fill, while hot, 
with a mixture made according to the following recipe : 

Cut a pair of blanched sweetbreads into small dice. Cut ten 
canned mushrooms into quarters and mix them with the sweet- 
breads. Add eight blanched and chopped almonds and six olives 
cut into tiny pieces. Heat a cup of cream and thicken it with a 
teaspoonful of cornstarch rubbed into one of butter. When 
smooth and thick add the sweetbreads, olives, etc. If too thick 
now, thin the mixture with a little mushroom liquor. As soon 
as all the ingredients are heated through remove from the fire 
and turn into the shells. 



Timbales of sweetbreads 

Blanch and chop two pairs of sweetbreads until as fine as pow- 
der, then rub them very smooth with the back of a silver spoon. 
Work into this paste a gill of sweet cream and the beaten yolks of 
two eggs. Season with salt and white pepper, and beat long and 
hard. Butter small timbale molds or "nappies," and pour the 
mixture into them. Set the molds in a pan of hot water and bake 
in a hot oven until "set." Loosen the contents of the nappies 
with a sharp knife, and turn out the molds upon a hot dish. Pour 
a white sauce about them. 

Sweetbreads en nid 

Follow directions for larded sweetbreads, and keep hot. Make 
a "nest" for them of cold boiled ham shredded into bits hardly 
larger than coarse straw ; cold roast chicken, turkey or veal, 
and cold boiled spaghetti in four-inch lengths. Arrange upon 
a hot platter to simulate a nest, pour a little scalding, well- 
seasoned gravy over them, and set the dish in a hot oven about 
five minutes. Have ready "a large cupful of rich tomato sauce, 
strained and thickened with a roux of butter and flour, and sea- 
soned with salt, paprika and onion juice. Lay the sweetbreads 
upon the "straw," and pour the boiling tomato sauce over all.' 



LUNCHEON DISHES 171 

A baked mince 

Mix together two cupfuls of minced cold lamb, chicken or veal, 
one cupful of chopped ham and one cupful of fine bread-crumbs. 
Moisten thoroughly with well-seasoned soup stock. Turn into a 
greased bake-dish and set in the oven until heated through. 
Break upon the top of the mince as many eggs as will lie side by 
side on it, sprinkle with salt and pepper, return to the oven and 
bake until the whites are set and firm. Send to table in a pud- 
ding-dish. 

Curried beef 

Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan and cook in 
it for five minutes an onion, sliced. Remove the onion, and stir 
into the melted butter two tablespoonfuls of browned flour, mixed 
with a tablespoonful of curry powder. Cook until they bubble, 
then pour on them a pint of beef stock. Stir until you have a 
thick, brown sauce. Season with salt and mix with it two cupfuls 
of cold roast beef cut into dice. Toss and stir until the meat is 
heated through. Have ready on a platter a hollowed mold of 
boiled rice, and pour the meat and sauce in the center and about 
the base of this. 

Curried veal 

Cut three pounds of lean veal into dice an inch square. Fry a 
sliced onion in two tablespoonfuls of butter until it begins to 
color. Strain out the onion ; heat the butter to hissing, put in 
the meat cubes and shake over the coals until heated through and 
slightly browned. Turn the contents of the frying-pan into a 
pot, rinsing out the pan with a cupful of boiling water, just 
enough to cover the meat. Sprinkle over all three table-spoon- 
fuls of finely-minced salt pork and some chopped parsley, 
cover closely and stew gently for two hours, or until the veal is 
tender. Drain the meat free from gravy in a colander and keep 
hot over boiling water. Return the gravy to the fire; add salt 
if necessary. Have ready in a cup a great spoonful of browned 
flour, wet to a paste with cold water. When smooth, add a tea- 



172 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

spoonful of curry, and stir in well before adding both to the hot 
gravy. As it begins to boil put in the meat; cook gently (cov- 
ered) ten minutes, and serve. 

Always serve boiled rice with curry, the same person helping 
both. A large spoonful of the rice is put upon the heated plate, 
and the curry poured over it. Bananas that have been chilled 
upon the ice are a most grateful accompaniment to curry of any 
kind. One is given to each person, who peels and slices it with a 
silver knife. 

* 

Curried lamb or mutton 

Make in the same way, substituting either of these meats for 
veal. If you like, stir a little currant jelly into the gravy. 

Curried chicken 

Joint the chicken as for frying, divide the breast and the back 
into two pieces, and proceed as with a curry of veal. It is par- 
ticularly nice and popular with all who have been gently led on 
to appreciate a savory curry. 

A "toss-up" of veal 

Make a roux of one tablespoonful of butter and the same of 
flour; when very hot and bubbling, add a little onion juice, pep- 
per and salt, four tablespoonfuls of hot milk (cream if you have 
it), with a pinch of soda heated in it; lastly, six tablespoonfuls of 
rich, strained tomato sauce. Stir in two cupfuls of cold veal, cut 
into dice, and the moment it begins to boil remove from the fire 
to a hot dish. 

Mince of veal garnished with eggs 

Make the mince as directed in foregoing recipe, but somewhat 
stiffer ; season highly, bring to a boil and mold in the middle of a 
hot platter. Against this hillock of mince lay fried eggs, neatly 
trimmed, and outside of these curled strips of fried breakfast 



LUNCHEON DISHES 173 

bacon. This dish will be much improved by the addition of half 
a can of mushrooms, minced fine. 



Mince of lamb and rice 

This is very much like the mince just described, the main dif- 
ference being that a cupful of cold boiled rice and a green sweet 
pepper minced fine are added to the meat and tomato sauce. You 
may also substitute poached eggs for fried, and ham for bacon. 

Any of the dishes just mentioned make savory a plain family 
luncheon, and may be easily prepared at little expense by the 
housewife who keeps a bright lookout for available "left-overs." 

An Italian hotch-potch 

Which became a favorite with us under the general name of 
"Frittura" during the winters we spent in Florence. 

I suppose that it was a weekly clearing-house for all manner of 
leavings from roast and boiled meats, but it was good! Calf's and 
poultry livers ; cold mutton, lamb and veal ; calf's brains ; now and 
then oysters ; small artichokes ; sprigs of cauliflower ; potatoes ; 
celery all cooked, cut into small pieces, seasoned, rolled in flour, 
.next in egg, again in flour, and fried ; first the meat, then the veg- 
etables, in boiling oil, and drained, were duly sorted, but served 
upon one and the same dish very hot. 

Stew of mutton and peas 

Cut three pounds of lean mutton into dice. In a pot fry six 
slices of fat salt pork ; when crisp, remove them with a skimmer 
and lay in the grease the mutton, dredged with flour and half 
an onion sliced. Cook for five minutes, then cover with cold 
water and simmer until the meat is very tender. Remove the 
meat, lay it on a platter, sprinkle with salt and pepper and keep 
it hot while you thicken the gravy in the pot with a brown roux, 
and season it to taste with a tablespoonf ul of tomato catsup, a tea- 
spoonful of kitchen bouquet and salt and pepper to taste. Now 



174 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

add the contents of a can of peas. These peas should have been 
drained and exposed to the air for an hour. Bring the stew to a 
boil, cook for five minutes, return the meat to the pot for a min- 
ute, then pour all into the hot platter. 

Mince turnovers 

Two cupfuls of flour, sifted twice with one rounded teaspoonful 
of baking-powder and half as much salt. Chop into it two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, and wet up with a cupful of milk, quickly 
and lightly. Roll into a sheet less than a quarter-inch thick, 
and this into squares about six inches across. Put into the 
middle of each square a large tablespoonful of minced poultry, 
veal, ham or lamb or a mixture of these well-seasoned and wet 
with gravy. Double the paste into a triangle, enfolding the meat ; 
pinch or print the edges to hold them together, and bake. 

They are good hot or cold. 

Beef with sauce piquante 

Cut slices from yesterday's roast of beef, mutton or veal. Put 
into a saucepan three tablespoonfuls of butter, a teaspoonful of 
vinegar, a half -teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, a tablespoonful of 
tomato catsup, a teaspoonful of made mustard, and salt and pep- 
per to taste. Stir these ingredients well together and lay the 
sliced meat into the sauce thus prepared. Turn the meat over 
and over until heated through, and serve with the sauce poured 
over it. 

Larded beef 

With a sharp knife make through a round of beef incisions an 
inch apart. Into the holes thus made stick long strips of fat salt 
pork. Rub the meat with a dressing made of equal parts of oil 
and vinegar, seasoned with salt and pepper. Let the meat lie in 
this for eight hours. Put the meat into a covered roaster, pour a 
pint of beef stock around it and roast for four hours. Set away 
in the gravy with a weight on the top. When cold, slice very 
thin and serve. 



LUNCHEON DISHES 175 

Beef loaf 

Mix together three pounds of chopped raw beef, one-quarter of 
a pound of minced salt pork, one cup of cracker dust, two tea- 
spoonfuls, each, of salt and pepper, and moisten all with two 
beaten eggs and a teaspoonful of onion juice. Work in two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and pack in a greased mold. 
Cover; set in a roasting-pan of boiling water, and cook in a 
steady oven for two hours. Let the loaf get cold in the mold be- 
fore turning out. 

Veal loaf 

Chop two pounds of cold cooked veal very fine, and work into 
it a teaspoonful, each, of salt, pepper and onion juice, a dozen 
chopped olives and as many minced mushrooms. Wet with a 
half-pint of veal or chicken stock. Pack in a greased mold and 
cook as in the preceding recipe. Have the loaf very cold before 
turning it out. 

Pressed veal 

Boil two pounds of lean veal in enough water to cover it. 
When cold, remove the meat from the liquor, skim the grease from 
the latter and chop the meat fine. To the chopped veal add a 
cupful of minced boiled ham and two hard-boiled eggs, chopped. 
Season the veal liquor with celery salt, pepper, a little tomato 
catsup and a dash of nutmeg. Make the chopped meat very 
moist with this liquor and press the mass hard into a buttered 
mold. Cover and set in the oven for half an hour. Remove from 
the oven; keep in a cool place for twenty-four hours, and turn 
from the mold upon a chilled platter. 

Jellied tongue 

Boil a tongue, and when cold place it in a brick-shaped mold. 
Into a pint of seasoned and heated beef stock stir a half-box of 
soaked gelatine, and when this is dissolved pour the stock around 
the tongue in the mold. When cool, set on the ice until the jelly 
is very firm. Turn out on a cold platter. 



i/6 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Jellied chicken 

Boil a chicken the day before it is to be used. When the liquor 
is cold skim from it every bit of fat. 

Soak a half-cup of gelatine in a cup of cold water for two 
hours. Remove all skin from the chicken and cut the meat into 
neat dice. Cut two dozen canned French mushrooms into halves. 
Stone and halve one dozen large olives. 

Bring to a boil and strain a pint of the chicken liquor ; stir into 
it the soaked gelatine, and set aside to cool. As it begins to 
thicken prepare your chicken loaf in the following manner : In 
a buttered mold lay a stratum of the chicken, sprinkle with pep- 
per and salt, and a few halved olives and mushrooms, pour upon 
this the thickening, but still liquid, jelly. Then add more chicken, 
mushrooms and olives; pour upon them more jelly, and proceed 
in this manner until the mold is full. Set in a cool place for 
twenty-four hours before using. Lay a warm cloth for a mo- 
ment about the mold, then invert it upon a chilled platter. This 
loaf is delicious served with lettuce and mayonnaise. 

Beefsteak and sherry sauce 

Broil a porterhouse steak over a clear fire until done. Lay on 
a hot platter. Make a sauce of a cupful of beef bouillon, thickened 
with a tablespoonful of brown roux, and when this is smooth add 
to it a wineglassful of sherry, a tablespoonful of onion juice and 
a half-cupful of French mushrooms, cut in half. Boil up once and 
pour over the steak. 

Mock roast chicken 

Boil and chop fine the giblets from three chickens saved from 
roast or fricassee. Trim the fat from a good-sized, but not thick, 
round steak. Make a forcemeat in the following manner : 

Mix together the chopped chicken giblets, two hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped fine, and a half-cupful of fine bread-crumbs. Moisten all 
with chicken stock. Lay the steak upon the table, cover thickly 
with the forcemeat and roll it up, as you would a sheet of music, 
tying it in shape with stout strings. Melt two tablespoonfuls of 



LUNCHEON DISHES 177 

butter in a frying-pan and cook the steak in this just long enough 
to brown it lightly. Remove the meat from the pan and put 
over the fire in a large pot. Add to the fat in the pan a table- 
spoonful of browned flour and pour upon it two cups of chicken 
stock. Stir to a smooth sauce, season to taste and pour over the 
steak in the pot. Cover closely and simmer for an hour and a 
half. Transfer the meat to a hot platter, remove the string, and 
pour the sauce over it. 

Stewed rump steak 

Trim the fat from the edge of a thick rump steak, and put the 
steak over the fire in a large pot. Pour over it a cup of cold 
water, cover closely and set at the side of the range, where it will 
simmer for three-quarters of an hour after it reaches the boil. 
Remove the meat from the pot and transfer to a baking-pan ; 
season the gravy and pour it over the top, and cook for fifteen 
minutes longer, basting three times during the process. Remove 
the steak to a hot platter and set in the open oven while you add 
to the gravy a cup of soup stock and thicken it with a little 
browned flour rubbed to a paste with a spoonful of butter. Sea- 
son with kitchen bouquet, celery salt and a half-teaspoonful of 
good sauce. Add a dozen canned mushrooms cut in half. Cook 
one minute and pour over the steak. 

Rump steak and tomatoes 

With a sharp carving-knife split a thick rump steak, thus mak- 
ing two thin steaks. Spread the lower half of this with bits of 
butter, a little minced ham and a cupful of tomatoes. (Use the 
canned tomatoes, straining off the juice and using it for the 
sauce.) Lay the upper half of the steak, sandwich-wise, upon the 
lower, and fasten the two together with small, stout skewers. 
Lay the meat in a covered roasting-pan, dash a cup of boiling 
water over it, and cook, allowing twenty minutes to each pound. 
Transfer to a hot dish, remove the skewers and pour over the 
steak a savory tomato sauce.

178 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Mutton mince with tomatoes 

Make three cups of good tomato sauce thickened with a heap- 
ing teaspoonful of flour rubbed into one of butter. Keep hot in 
a double boiler set at the side of range. 

Toast slices of bread, butter, spread on a platter, and put 
a tablespoonful of tomato sauce on each. Into the remainder of 
the tomato sauce turn two cupfuls of minced mutton, put the 
saucepan over the fire, stir until the meat is thoroughly heated, 
season to taste and pour upon the toast. 

Porterhouse steak with oysters 

Broil a fine tender steak on both sides and transfer it to a hot 
dish. Pepper and salt well, then rub into the steak a mixture of 
butter rubbed to a cream with the juice of half a lemon. 

Put one pint of oysters into a saucepan without any of the 
liquor. Stir until the edges ruffle, add one tablespoonful of butter 
creamed with an equal amount of flour and cooked to a roux. 
Pour over the hot steak and serve 'at once. 

Savory stew of beef 

Cut two pounds of raw lean beef into very small strips, almost 
like straws, with a keen blade. Put into a saucepan ; cover with 
cold weak stock, or, if you have none, with cold water, and cook 
slowly two hours. Put into another saucepan a cupful of 
rich brown stock, one small onion chopped fine, a little grated 
nutmeg, cayenne pepper and the juice of half a lemon ; boil these 
ingredients a few minutes and mix with the beef, adding a little 
browned flour if necessary. Dish upon a hot platter, lay triangles 
of fried toast about the base, and serve. 

Roulades of beef 

Cut two pounds of lean steak into pieces about five inches long 
and half as wide, and less than half an inch thick. Make a force- 
meat of cooked sausage, chopped fine, and mixed with one-fourth 



LUNCHEON DISHES 179 

as much fine, buttered and seasoned bread-crumbs. Place two 
tablespoonfuls of this mixture on each piece of meat, roll them 
into the shape of a small cylinder, and sew both ends with fine 
thread. Let them brown in butter in a frying-pan, then put them 
into a saucepan with the juice of a lemon, two cupfuls of brown 
stock, a carrot and an onion, sliced, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Cover closely, and cook for two hours. Transfer to a hot platter, 
clip and draw out the thread ; thicken the gravy left in the sauce- 
pan with browned flour, add a little Worcestershire sauce and a 
glass of sherry ; boil up once and pour over the roulades. 

How to use up the cold tongue 

Cut cold boiled beef -tongue into dice. Make a roux in a sauce- 
pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter and the same amount of 
flour, salt, pepper, and the juice of half a lemon. Add a cupful 
of strained tomato. Simmer slowly for ten minutes. Strain, re- 
turn to the saucepan, lay in the tongue and let it stand where it will 
keep hot without boiling for five minutes. Serve in a hot platter. 

This is still better if made of fresh beef's tongue. 

Galantine 

Cut a strip of lean veal from the loin or the breast, about six 
inches wide and twice as long. Prepare a forcemeat of cooked 
ham, chopped mushrooms, any scraps of poultry you may have, 
the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, one-third as much crumbs as 
you have meat, season with paprika and grated onion. 

Lay this forcemeat in the center of the veal, roll up carefully, 
wrap in cheese-cloth and sew up closely. Lay it in a plate in a 
kettle, cover with cold water, add one-half teaspoonful of salt, one 
bay leaf and a sprig of thyme, cover and boil for fifteen minutes.- 
Then put it at one side of the fire where it can only simmer for two 
hours. When done set aside, with a plate upon it and a heavy 
weight upon the plate, until next day. Clip the threads, unwrap 
the meat and serve, garnished with cress and nasturtiums. Cut 
perpendicularly.

Chipped smoked beef 

Shred the beef into thin straws. Make a white sauce, lay in 
the beef and simmer for five minutes. Then stir in a beaten egg, 
a little onion juice and pepper. Stir until the egg is set, and 
serve upon toast. 

Brains on toast 

Scald and blanch the brains, beat smooth, add three eggs and 
beat hard. Have ready a tablespoonful of butter in a frying- 
pan hissing hot ; turn in the mixture and stir steadily for three 
minutes. Serve upon rounds of toast. 



Baked calf's liver (larded) 

Lard with strips of fat salt pork, inserted perpendicularly. The 
lardoons should project on both sides. Cover the bottom of a 
saucepan with minced pork, place the liver on it; add a carrot, 
two small onions, a half-dozen stalks of celery, all chopped fine ; 
the juice of a lemon and a quart of strong stock ; cover the sauce- 
pan and bake slowly for two hours and a half, basting often with 
the liquor in the pan. When done remove the liver, and put into 
the oven for a few minutes to brown ; make a rich gravy of the 
remainder of the gravy in the pan ; put the liver in the center of 
the dish, strain the sauce and pour over it. 

Mock psite de foie gras 

When poultry is in full season and the weather is cold, save 
the giblets from half a dozen fowls, boiling them, salting slightly 
to keep them and setting them in a cold place. When you have 
enough, chop them, rejecting tough portions, and run through a 
vegetable press. Work to a smooth paste with melted butter, 
season with paprika, salt, and a dash of onion juice. Pack down 
in small jars, pour melted butter over the top, and keep in a cool, 
dry place. If you will boil a few mushrooms in salted water, 
strain, cut them into coarse dice and intersperse throughout the 



LUNCHEON DISHES 181 

paste, you will have a veritable imitation of the famous Stras- 
burg pates. . 

You may substitute calf's, lamb's or pig's liver for those of 
fowls if you can not get the latter. 

Savory ham 

Fry slices of boiled ham on both sides. Transfer to a hot dish. 
Cook together in a frying-pan four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a 
teaspoonful of granulated sugar, a teaspoonful of French mus- 
tard, and a dash of paprika. Stir until very hot, and pour over 
the fried ham. 

Cottage pie 

(Contributed) 

Chop cold meat very fine. To each cupful add one saltspoonful 
of salt and one-and-a-half saltspoonfuls of pepper, a pinch of sum- 
mer savory and one-half cupful of stock. Put into a baking dish 
and cover with a crust of mashed potatoes. Brush over the top 
with milk and bake in an oven to a golden brown. 

Breaded tongue with tomato sauce 

(Contributed) 

Take six slices of cooked tongue, one-half can of tomatoes, one 
slice of onion, three tablespoonfuls of butter and a bit of bay leaf, 
three tablespoonfuls of flour, one-third cupful of bread-crumbs and 
one egg. Cut the tongue in slices about one-half inch thick. Dip 
into the crumbs, then in the egg and then in the crumbs again, and 
saute in butter. Place on a dish and pour around it a sauce made 
by cooking together the tomatoes, onion and bay leaf fifteen min- 
utes. Season with salt and pepper. 

Steamed beef 

(Contributed) 

Select a piece of lean beef, wipe well with a cloth wrung out of 
cold water ; remove all pieces of fat and gash with a sharp knife. 



182 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Put the meat into a stone crock, sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
put in a few cloves. Cover with a tight lid. Cook in an oven 
slowly for several hours allowing no steam to escape. When 
done the meat will be very tender. 

Irish stew 

Take a pound of meat from the neck of beef or mutton and cut 
into neat pieces. Stew gently, and about an hour before it is done 
season and add two onions cut into dice and two carrots also cut 
into dice. About half an hour before the meat is done add two 
potatoes and three stalks of celery cut into dice. Serve on a plat- 
ter, putting the vegetables around the meat. 

Veal loaf (raw meat) 

Put three pounds of raw veal and one-fourth pound of salt pork 
through the meat chopper ; add to this one teacupf ul of fine bread 
crumbs, one tablespoonful of butter, three beaten eggs to which 
four tablespoonfuls of cream have been added, one teaspoonful of 
pepper, three teaspoonfuls of salt and two teaspoonfuls of pow- 
dered sage. Mix well together and form into a loaf. Bake in a 
mold two and a half hours, basting with butter and water. 



FAMILIAR TALK 

LIVING TO LEARN 

WHEN one is too old to learn anything, his day of life is vif- 
tually over, so far as usefulness to his kind goes. The ten or 
twenty years left to him upon earth are a blunder on the part of 
some one, and we know that the Creator and Father of us all 
makes no mistakes. In the eloquent (and pessimistic) description 
of old age from the pen of the royal preacher-poet, we read that 
the aged shall be afraid of that which is high. The shrinking from 
new emprises, characteristic of the days when the almond-tree 
shall blossom and the knees that upbear (or keep) the house, shall 
tremble, is excusable when physical infirmity has enfeebled nerv- 
ous forces and digestion. There is no excuse except this for the 
cessation of mind-growth. 

This may sound didactic. It is written with a purpose. Given 
a sane mind in a sane body, and learning should go on indefi- 
nitely. The man or woman of mature years leaves off lessons 
because he chooses to get out of the habit of study. The preju- 
dice against old cooks said by one authority to be either drunk 
or crazy as a class is founded upon this disinclination to learn 
novel methods. She who honestly aspires after excellence never 
thinks that she has reached it. When, in saying, "that is not MY 
WAY/' a cook believes that she has put an end, not only to con- 
troversy, but to any suspicion that the world may have moved an 
inch or two since she learned her trade she registers herself 
among the incurables. 

The mistress who yields to the earliest manifestations of an 
inclination to draw the dead line in housewifely progress is weakly 
indulgent or blindly foolish. In one wealthy family, not a 
hundred miles from a great city, "a valued old servant" played 

183 



184 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the tyrant for over a score of years. Little by little, the em- 
ployers, mindful of her long term of faithful service, admitted 
her pleas that this or that new-fangled way was opposed to her 
habits and inclination, until family bills of fare were monotonous 
to boredom, the style of serving that of a preceding generation. 
At last Elizabeth died and was buried at the master's expense. 

"It's dreadful, I suppose," piped the youngling of the long- 
suffering band on the way home from the funeral. "But it ought 
to be some comfort that we won't be obliged to have rice pudding 
three times a week any more." 

Faithful Elizabeth had her epitaph. 

Nothing is more solemnly and sadly sure in this rushing age 
than that he who does not keep up with it will be thrown down 
and trampled out of sight. It is a trifle, apparently, when a 
woman tabooes oil in salad dressing because she "has never been 
used to putting it in," when she thinks mint sauce a "trashy" 
accompaniment to roast lamb, and "won't hear of hot sauce with 
cold pudding," or whipped cream as an accompaniment to ice-cold 
raw tomatoes. When the vegetable dishes must all be set on the 
table with the meat, "as she has always had them," and lettuce 
be cut up and dressed in the kitchen at the cook's convenience, 
instead of being served, crisp and cool, from the deft fingers of 
some member of the family who is "up in salads." 

Each protest is a symptom of decadence which is wilful, not 
inevitable. She has stopped learning because she has "stopped." 
In time, mental muscles become stiff, but disu'se is the cause of the 
change. 

"I account that day lost in which I have learned no new thing," 
said an aged sage. 

Our housewife may lay the saying to heart. If there be a bet- 
ter way than hers of doing anything from making pickles to 
giving a wedding supper she should be on the alert to possess 
herself of it. It is not true that it is easier for young people to 
keep themselves and their houses abreast of the times than it is for 
their elders. The first step that counts in the downward road is 
the tendency not to take any step at all. To stand still is to be 
left. 



FAMILIAR TALK 185 

Many who believe that they cultivate the seeing eye, the hear- 
ing ear, and the willing, receptive mind, live and die without 
learning the great truth that the mighty thing we call Life is made 
up of minute matters. They see and admire the coral reef that 
heaves a back a mile long out of the surf, and give never a 
thought to the coral builders. 

A man who thinks much and observes much, once told me that 
one essential difference between a man's work and a woman's is 
that he grasps general principles while she gives her attention 
to details. 

A man, according to this authority, is an impressionist painter, 
handling his brush boldly, dashing in broad effects of light and 
shadow, while a woman finishes each object carefully, sometimes, 
after the manner of the Dutch school of painting, showing the 
very hairs upon the brawny peasant's arm. 

( I may be excused for saying, in passing, that, being a woman, 
I founded upon his general principle the particular moral that one 
sex supplements the other, and that the Creator meant the work 
of the world to be done by them in concert.) 

He had turned from his desk to talk with me and, while talk- 
ing, looked ruefully at an inky forefinger. 

"I should keep some pumice stone, or acetic acid, or acetate of 
soda, or ammonia, here to remove ink-stains," he said. "I always 
spill ink in filling my fountain pen." 

A box of matches was in a pigeonhole ; a wet sponge, used for 
stamping and sealing letters, was close to the disfigured hand. 
I bade him wet the match and rub it upon the stain until it dis- 
appeared the work of a minute. The sulphur in the ever-con- 
venient match acted upon the black spots without blackening the 
skin, whereas any one of the four detersives he had mentioned 
would have left a hard, disagreeable sensation upon the cuticle. 
He was all right as to the principles. The one driblet of practi- 
cal wisdom was for the moment worth them all. 

A bright young woman whom I am glad to know, has written 
a little book entitled, "FIRST AID TO THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER." 
It includes scores of things which everybody ought to know, and 
which everybody else, especially the writer of household manuals. 



T<% MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

takes it for granted that the housewife does know. It is intelli- 
gent attention to this very matter of detail that constitutes the 
"finish" of work of whatever kind. One of the "Sunday books" 
of my childhood was a series called "THE WEEK," a story of 
English cottage life. I can recall many sentences and the whole 
story in substance. One remark was to this effect : "Mary was a 
good housekeeper; Nanny an indifferent. Nanny's hearth was 
free of ashes and cinders, but dusty in the corners. Mary's was 
not only swept, but pipe-clayed. Mary's kettle was bright and 
black; Nanny's clean, but brown and dull." 

That is, Nanny had mastered general principles; Mary looked 
to details. 

I read last week in a woman's corner of a daily paper a letter 
from a grateful housewife whose hall carpet had been deluged 
by the kerosene from a broken lamp. By the advice of a visitor 
she promptly covered the great spot with dry oatmeal. When 
this was swept off in the morning not a trace of the oil remained. 

"My husband explains this by saying that the oatmeal is at 
once an alkali and an absorbent," she writes. "I pass the useful 
knowledge on." 

A careless servant knocked a lamp from the table in the bed- 
room of my summer cottage and the matting got a full quart of 
the best kerosene. I had the floating oil wiped up with a clean, 
soft cloth, opened the windows, shut the door, and let no one 
enter the room for twelve hours. Not a trace of grease remained 
at the end of that time. The volatile oil had effaced itself. The 
alkaline absorbent was not needed. 

"We are all fond of cauliflower ; my husband and sons like 
young onions in the season," said the mistress of a big house. 
"We can not have either of these vegetables cooked on account 
of the odor. It fills the house from cellar to attic." 

A housewife who lives in a tiny city flat has both of these 
dishes whenever she likes. The vegetables are put over the fire 
in cold water; a little salt is thrown in, and the pot is left un- 
covered. If these rules be strictly obeyed, the rising odor during 
cooking will be scarcely perceptible. 

A physician, driving with his wife through a lonely country 



FAMILIAR TALK 187 

neighborhood, heard screams issuing- from the open door of a 
cottage and went in to see if he could be of use. A child had 
upset a kettle of boiling water upon its legs and feet and was in 
agony from the scald. 

"Have you linseed oil and lime water in the house ?" . asked 
the doctor. 

Before the distracted mother could say that there was neither, 
the doctor's wife said, "Do you burn wood in any room?" 

There was a wood-stove in the parlor. There is always lard 
in the country pantry. In three minutes an ointment of lard and 
soot from the stovepipe was beaten up and spread upon old linen ; 
in five minutes the scalds were covered with it. The relief was 
speedy ; the cure complete in a day or two. 

The wise housewife gleans a great store of precious driblets 
against the hour and minute of need. Such study of details is 
like sweeping up gold filings. The separate particles are nomi- 
nally valueless, compared with the mastery of great principles. 
When massed and assorted, they go far toward making life easy. 

A suggestive German fable is of a trooper who saw a loose 
horseshoe on the ground as he was going into battle, got down, 
picked it up and hung it about his neck by a string. In the first 
charge a bullet struck the horseshoe and glanced aside harmlessly. 

"Ha !" said the trooper. "Even a little armor is a good thing, 
if rightly placed." 

The horseshoe was "a detail." 




GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

( Which the housewife is particularly requested to read) 

Two things are essential to the excellence of croquettes. The 
mixture composing them must not be too stiff. The fat in which 
they are cooked must be boiling when they go in, and deep enough 
to float them. If these conditions are neglected, you will have a 
pasty, sticky compound, soaked with grease and misshapen, per- 
haps scorched on the under side. The hot fat should form a crust 
instantly which prevents the fat from touching the interior of 
the croquette. 

Always make out croquettes at least a couple of hours before 
they are to be cooked; roll in egg, then in fine crumbs, or in 
cracker-dust; arrange upon a floured dish, not touching one an- 
other, and leave upon ice, or in a very cold place to stiffen. 

Oyster croquettes 

Cook twenty-five oysters in their liquor until they just begin to 
ruffle, remove from the fire, drain (reserving half a cupful of the 
liquor) , and chop fine. Stir together over the fire two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour and two of butter and pour on them a half-cupful of 
cream with a pinch of soda in it, and the half-cupful of oyster 
liquor. When beaten to a smooth sauce add slowly the beaten 
yolk of two eggs, then the chopped oysters, salt and pepper and a 
pinch of grated nutmeg. Remove at once from the fire and set 
aside to cool. When very cold form into croquettes. 

188 



CROQUETTES 189 

Lobster croquettes 

(Contributed) 

Two cupfuls of minced lobster seasoned well with paprika, salt 
and a little mace. One-fourth the quantity of bread-crumbs, i. e. 
about half a cupful. Four tablespoonfr.ls of cream, heated (with 
a pinch of soda), and thickened with a teaspoonful of butter rolled 
in flour. Make a thick paste of the n.l.vture; let it get stiff and 
cold ; make into croquettes, roll in egg and cracker -crumbs ; set on 
the ice for an hour ; roll again in cracker-dust and fry in deep, 
hot cottolene or other fat, which has been heated slowly. Drain, 
garnish with lemon and parsley and serve. 

Chicken croquettes 

Cook together in a saucepan a tablespoonful of flour and one 
of butter until they are blended. Pour upon this white roux a 
cupful of rich milk, and when you have a smooth white sauce stir 
in a cupful and a half of minced boiled or roast chicken. Season to 
taste with celery salt, white pepper and a dash of nutmeg. Cook 
until well heated, then add the yolks of two eggs and cook for 
just two minutes before removing from the fire. Set aside until 
cold and stiff ; mold into croquettes, roll in cracker-dust, in beaten 
egg and yet again in cracker-dust, and set on the ice for two 
hours before frying. 

Turkey croquettes 

Make in the same way, but mince more finely, as the meat is 
firmer and harder. 

Veal croquettes 

Make a forcemeat of two cupfuls of minced veal, two table- 
spoonfuls of bread-crumbs, one scant teaspoonful of salt, one-quar- 
ter teaspoonful of paprika, one-eighth teaspoonful of mace, one 
teaspoonful of onion juice, a tablespoonful of butter and the yolks 
of two raw eggs. Stir in a saucepan over the fire until the mix- 
ture is heated through, and set aside to cool. When cool, make 



190 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

up into croquettes, dip in beaten egg, roll in egg and fine crumbs 
and fry. Serve with tomato sauce. 

Veal anJ spaghetti croquettes 

Mix together a cupful, each, of cold cooked veal and of cold 
boiled spaghetti, both minced fine. Season with salt, paprika and 
onion juice. Stir into a cupful of drawn butter, well thickened; 
cook together in a saucepan until smoking hot, when add the yolk 
of a raw egg and a tablespoonful of Parmesan cheese (pow- 
dered). Form into croquettes, dip into beaten egg, roll in bread- 
crumbs and fry in smoking hot cottolene or other fat, or dripping 
until brown. Serve with tomato sauce. 

Chicken and macaroni croquettes 

Make as directed in the foregoing recipe, omitting the cheese. 
A nice sauce for either of these dishes is stewed and strained 
tomatoes, thickened with a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour 
and cooked one minute before a large tablespoonful of grated 
Parmesan cheese is stirred in. 

Rice croquettes 

Beat an egg light and stir it into a cupful of boiled rice ; add a 
teaspoonful, each, of sugar and melted butter, salt to taste, add 
enough cream to form the mixture into croquettes of the right 
consistency. Dip each croquette into beaten egg, then in cracker- 
dust and set all for two hours in a cold place before frying in 
boiling cottolene, or other fat, to a golden brown. 

Croquettes of brains 

Calf's, or lamb's or pig's brains may be used for this dish. 

Wash the brains in cold water, put them over the fire in boil- 
ing water, cook for two minutes, drain and lay in ice-cold water 
until cold and stiff. 

Beat them into a paste. Have ready some thick drawn butter 



CROQUETTES 191 

and beat into the brains until the paste is smooth and stiff enough 
to handle ; add, then, flour to stiffen it yet more ; season with pep- 
per, salt and a little very finely minced parsley ; flour your hands, 
make the paste into croquettes ; roll in egg and cracker-crumbs ; 
set on the ice for two hours or more and fry in deep boil- 
ing cottolene or other fat. Drain and serve. 



Veal and ham croquettes 

Mince enough cold veal to make a cupful when chopped ; mix 
with it half as much cold boiled ham and one-fourth as much fine 
crumbs. Rub the yolk of a hard-boiled egg through a colander 
or vegetable press, and add to the mixture. Season with pepper 
and onion juice and moisten with thickened gravy or with drawn 
butter. Lastly, whip in a raw egg to bind the mixture and make 
into croquettes. Roll in egg and in crumbs, set aside to form and 
stiffen, and fry. 

Potato croquettes 

Work to a paste two cupfuls of mashed potatoes and a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Season with salt and pepper and beat 
light with a raw egg. Form into balls or croquettes ; roll in egg 
and then in cracker-dust ; let them stand on ice until stiff and fry in 
deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. Drain off every drop of fat 
and serve hot. 

Hominy croquettes 

Make precisely as you would potato croquettes, beating hard 
until the mixture is entirely free from lumps, hominy being more 
adhesive and cohesive than potato. 



Fish and potato croquettes 

One cupful of cold cooked fish picked to pieces with a fork, and 
one-third the quantity of mashed potato worked to a stiff cream 
with a little drawn butter and seasoned with pepper, salt and 
a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Make into croquettes; roll in 



192 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

egg, then in cracker-crumbs ; let them get cold and firm and fry 
in deep, hot cottolene or other fat. 

Beef croquettes 

Two cups of minced cold roast beef or steak (never corned 
beef). One-quarter as much mashed potato. Season well with 
pepper, salt and onion juice, with a little very finely minced pars- 
ley. Enough gravy to moisten the mixture and a raw egg to 
bind it. 

Work together well, mold into cones, cover with egg and crack- 
er-dust ; let them get chilled for two hours and fry in deep, boil- 
ing cottolene or other fat, or dripping. 

Potato and nut croquettes 

Blanch the kernels, of two dozen English walnuts, or twice that 
number of pecans, by pouring scalding water over them and leav- 
ing them in it until the skins crack and curl. 'Strip them bare, 
spread on a dish, sprinkle lightly with celery salt and paprika, and 
let them get perfectly cold. When crisp, pound in a mortar, or 
chop and crush fine. Mix with them two cupfuls of mashed po- 
tatoes, into which you have worked a little cream, butter and salt 
while hot. Beat into the mixture the raw yolk of an egg. Mold 
into croquettes ; set aside until stiff ; roll in egg and then in 
cracker-crumbs, and fry. Dry in a hot colander and serve at once. 

Celery croquettes 

Cook together a tablespoonf ul of flour and one of butter* and 
when they bubble pour upon them a cupful of milk. When this is 
thick and free from lumps pour it gradually upon the beaten yolks 
of two eggs. Now add a cupfuH of celery cut (not chopped) into 
tiny bits, season with celery salt and white pepper and turn out 
to cool. When cold form with floured hands into small cro- 
quettes, roll these in cracker-dust, then in beaten egg, again in 
cracker-dust and set aside for an hour before frying in deep, boil- 
ing cottolene or other fat, always brought gradually to the boil. 



CROQUETTES 193 

Oyster-plant croquettes 

(Contributed) 

Boil, mash and season the oyster-plant, mold into shapes, sprin- 
kle with bread-crumbs, dip in egg and again in crumbs and fry 
in hot fat. 

Sweetbread croquettes 

(Contributed) 

Take four sweetbreads, removing pipes and membranes soak 
for an hour in cold salted water. Plunge into boiling salted water 
to which has been added a tablespoonful of vinegar; cook twenty 
minutes. Drop again into cold water to harden. Chop them 
very fine and season with salt and pepper and a teaspoonful of 
grated onion. Add the beaten yolks of three eggs, a tablespoonful 
of butter, one-half cupful of cream and enough fine bread-crumbs 
to make soft enough to roll into balls. Dip in. egg and then in 
bread-crumbs and fry in hot fat to a nice brown. Take up and 
drain on brown paper. Serve hot with sliced lemon.. 



WITH THE CASSEROLE 

THE French name "casserole" has a certain amount of terror 
for the American housewife. The foreign word startles her and 
awakens visions of cooking as done by a Parisian chef, or by one 
who has made the culinary art his profession. She, a plain, every- 
day housekeeper, would not dare aspire to the use of a casserole. 

And yet the casserole itself is no more appalling than a sauce- 
pan. It is simply a covered dish, made of fireproof pottery, which 
will stand the heat of the oven or the top of the range. And the 
dainty cooked in this dish is "casserole" of chicken, rice, etc., 
as the case may be. Like many another object of dread this, when 
once known, is converted into a* friend. 

Casserole of chicken 

Clean and joint a tender spring chicken. Put into a frying-pan 
three tablespoonfuls of butter and fry in this a small onion and a 
carrot, both cut into tiny dice. When these vegetables are lightly 
browned, turn into the casserole, add to them two cupfuls of clear 
soup stock, in which three bay leaves and a little thyme have been 
boiled and then removed. In this consomme lay the jointed 
chicken, put the closely-fitting cover on the casserole and set it 
in a steady oven. It should cook for an hour. At the end of this 
time stir into the chicken a dessertspoonful of tomato catsup. Re- 
cover and cook for half an hour longer. Then add two dozen 
small French mushrooms which have been previously stewed for 
ten minutes, lastly, a glass of sherry. Season the whole to taste 
with pepper and salt and leave uncovered in the oven long enough 
for the chicken to brown. Fresh mushrooms are, of course, bet- 
ter than canned when you can get them. 

194 



WITH THE CASSEROLE 195 

Casserole of rice and liver 

Boil a cupful of rice in a quart of water until reduced to a soft 
paste. Mash this rice paste smooth with two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and salt and pepper to taste. Line a well-greased casserole 
with the mixture, pressing the paste firmly against bottom and 
sides, and leaving a large hollow in the center. Set in a cold place 
until stiff and firm. Meanwhile boil a pound of lamb's liver, drain 
and chop fine. Heat in a saucepan two cupfuls of soup stock, sea- 
son with a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, thicken with browned 
flour and stir into this sauce the minced liver. Fill the hollow in 
the center of the rice with the liver mixture, sprinkle with bread- 
crumbs and set in the oven to brown. 



Casserole of potato and cheese 

Boil a sufficient number of potatoes to make three cupfuls when 
mashed. Return the mashed potatoes to a saucepan and stir over 
the fire, as you add slowly the beaten yolks of three eggs. When 
the smoking mass is hot and stiff, turn it into a greased casserole 
and press firmly against the sides, leaving a hollow in the middle 
about the size of a kitchen teacup. Brush the top and sides of the 
potato with the white of an egg and set in the oven until glazed 
and firm. Meanwhile, heat in a frying-pan or chafing-dish six 
tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese in a gill of milk and 
when hot add to it the yolk of an egg, a pinch of salt and a dash 
of paprika. When this cheese-sauce is thick and hot, remove the 
casserole from the oven, fill the hollow in the middle of the po- 
tato with the cheese mixture, sprinkle cracker-crumbs over the 
top of the potato and cheese and return to the oven to brown. 
Serve in the casserole and at once. 



Casserole of lamb or mutton chops 

Trim the chops neatly, removing every bit of fat and skin. In 
the bottom of the casserole put a layer of pared and shredded to- 
matoes ; sprinkle with salt, pepper, a little sugar and a teaspoonful 



196 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

of onion juice. Lay three or four chops upon the tomatoes; sea- 
son them with salt and pepper; arrange about them small pel- 
lets of parboiled potato, cut with a gouge, after the manner of 
Parisian potatoes, also a dozen or so champignons (canned 
mushrooms). Now, more tomato, seasoned as before, then more 
chops, potatoes and mushrooms, until all are used up in this 
order. The upper layer should be tomatoes. Pour in a generous 
cupful of stock bouillon, consomme, mutton broth, or whatever 
you have ; cover and cook steadily for two hours if the casserole 
be large. 

When the meat is tender to the trial-fork, pour off the gravy 
carefully into a saucepan, thicken with browned flour; add the 
juice of half a lemon, a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet and a glass 
of brown sherry. Pour back over the contents of the casserole, 
set in the oven for three minutes, covered, and serve in the dish. 

An elegant dish can be made of unpromising chops by following 
these directions. 

Mock casseroles of chicken 

Select large, smooth, tart apples of good flavor and of uniform 
size. Remove core with corer. Mince cold chicken fine, season 
with salt, a dash of cayenne, pinch of powdered thyme, one-half 
cupful of bread-crumbs, moistened with three or four teaspoonfuls 
of sweet cream. Fill each apple and bake in oven. Serve hot or 
cold with mayonnaise as a salad. 

% 

Creamed chicken 

Carve enough meat from a cold roast chicken to make a pint 
when cut into small dice. Cook together in a saucepan a table- 
spoonful, each, of butter and flour ; when they are blended pour 
upon them a cup of white stock, and when this is thick, a cup of 
milk. Stir to a smooth sauce and add the minced chicken. Season 
to taste ; cook until the meat is very hot and serve. 



WITH THE CASSEROLE 



Creamed chicken and macaroni 



197 



Cut cold boiled or roast chicken into small dice of uniform 
size, and into half-inch lengths half the quantity of cold, cooked 
macaroni. Make a good white sauce, season highly with paprika, 
salt and a suspicion of onion juice. Beat two eggs light and stir 
into them four tablespoonfuls of cream, heated, with a pinch of 
soda. Mix well with the chicken and spaghetti; put over the 
fire in a frying-pan, or broad saucepan, and stir and toss until 
smoking hot. Serve in a deep dish. 

Scallops of turkey or chicken 

Chop the meat fine and to two cupfuls add a tablespoonful of 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, half a cupful of boil- 
ing water, salt and pepper to taste. Put these all into a saucepan 
and stir while heating. Lastly, put in two raw eggs, beaten light, 
and take from the fire. Fill baking cups two-thirds full of the 
mixture, set in a pan of boiling water and bake about twenty-five 
minutes. Turn out carefully into a heated dish and pour white 
sauce around them. 

Philadelphia scrapple 

(Contributed) 

Take a cleaned pig's head and boil until the flesh slips easily 
from the bones. Remove all the bones and chop fine. Set the 
liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the cake 
of fat from the surface and return the liquor to the fire. When it 
boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and 
salt. Let it boil again and thicken with corn-meal as you would 
in making ordinary corn-meal mush, by letting it slip slowly 
through the fingers to prevent lumps. 

Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first, afterward putting 
back on the range in a position to boil" gently. When done, pour 
into a long, spare pan, not too deep, and mold. In cold weather 
this can be kept several weeks. Slice and saute in butter or drip- 
ping. 



CHEESE DISHES FOR LUNCHEON 



A fondu of cheese 

Grate cheese and crush broken and dried bread and crusts into 
fine crumbs. There should be two cupfuls of these to one of cheese. 
Wet the crumbs with two cupfuls of milk in which has been dis- 
solved a bit of soda no larger than a Lima bean. Beat two eggs 
light, whites and yolks apart; whip the yolks into the soaked 
crumbs with a tablespoonful of melted butter. Season with salt 
and a dust of cayenne, add the frothed whites, deftly and rapidly ; 
bake in a greased pudding dish in a brisk oven, keeping the dish 
covered until the fondu has puffed high and is crusty on top. 
Then brown lightly and serve at once, as it soon falls. Pass 
crackers and pickles with it. 

Rice and cheese pudding- 
Boil a cupful of rice tender ; drain dry in a hot colander ; set at 
the side of the range for ten minutes. Mix, then, with two beaten 
eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Line a 
well-greased dish with this paste, leaving a hollow in the middle. 
The walls of rice should be about an inch thick. Set in the hot 
oven for five minutes. Have ready a cupful of hot milk ; stir into 
it a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour, half a cupful of grated 
cheese, a generous pinch of paprika, with salt to taste, and a pinch 
of baking-soda. Lastly, and quickly, add a beaten egg. Pour 
this mixture into the hollowed rice, sift fine crumbs over it, and set 
covered in the oven. At the end of ten minutes uncover and 
brown slightly. Serve at once, as it falls into heaviness with 
standing. 



CHEESE DISHES FOR LUNCHEON 199 

Cheese rice 

Boil a cupful of rice in two quarts of water. When tender, turn 
into a colander, drain, shake hard and stand at the side of the 
range ten minutes to dry. Now stir into the rice, first, a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, then four tablespoonfuls of Parmesan 
cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper. Serve very hot. 

Tomatoes and cheese 

Cut the stem-end from large tomatoes, and with a small spoon 
scoop out the insides. To two tablespoonfuls of the tomato pulp 
add a teaspoonful of bread-crumbs and the same quantity of 
cheese crumbled into bits. Season to taste and return this mixture 
to the tomatoes. Replace the stem-ends and bake the tomatoes for 
twenty minutes in a roasting-pan. Transfer to a hot platter and 
serve. 

Cheese straws 

To a half pint of prepared flour add two ounces of grated Par- 
mesan cheese, moisten with the yolk of an egg and enough milk to 
make a paste that can be rolled out. Roll into a thin sheet and cut 
into narrow "straws." Bake to a delicate brown. While they are 
hot sift grated cheese over them. 

Cheese puffs 

In a saucepan of boiling water melt two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter. When the water and butter are boiling, stir into them four 
tablespoonfuls of flour, wet with a little cold water, and four 
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Cook for three minutes, stirring 
all the time. Remove from the fire, and when the mixture is cold 
add two eggs and beat hard for fifteen minutes. Line a baking- 
pan with greased paper and drop the mixture upon it, a spoonful 
at a time, leaving ample space between each puff for the swelling 
caused by baking. When puffed up and brown they are done and 
must be eaten at once. 



200 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Cheese fritters 

Make small sandwiches of buttered white bread (from which 
the crust has been removed) sliced thin and thin slices of cheese. 
Press each sandwich firmly, that the two pieces of bread may not 
separate in the cooking, and drop into boiling fat. Fry to a golden 
brown and remove to a colander lined with tissue paper. 

Egg and cheese timbales 

Beat six eggs very light and add to them a gill of warm milk, 
in which a pinch of soda has been dissolved, five tablespoonfuls of 
grated cheese and a pinch, each, of paprika and salt. Butter small 
timbale molds, or pate pans, fill with the egg mixture and set in a 
baking-pan of boiling water until the egg is set. Turn out care- 
fully on a hot platter and pour hot tomato sauce about them. 
Serve at once, as they soon fall. A nice luncheon entree. 

Cheese souffle 

Cook together in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls, each, of butter 
and flour, and when they are blended t pour upon them a half 
pint of milk. Stir to a smooth white sauce and stir into this eight 
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, a saltspoonful of salt, a pinch of 
baking-soda and a dash of paprika. Have ready beaten four eggs, 
white and yolks separate. Remove the cheese mixture from the 
fire and gradually beat into it the yolks of the eggs; last of all, 
fold in lightly the stiffened whites. Turn the mixture into a 
greased pudding-dish and bake in a steady oven to a golden 
brown. Serve immediately. 

Cheese ramakins 

Cut slices of bread very thick, pare off the crusts and press 
a round cake-cutter half-way through the middle of each slice. 
Take out the crumb enclosed in this circle. Butter the bread and 
set in the oven until dry and crisp. Now fill the hollow in each 
slice with a mixture made of a tablespoonful of butter, four table 



CHEESE DISHES FOR LUNCHEON 201 

spoonfuls of grated cheese, a tablespoonful of cream and a little 
salt and pepper. Set for five minutes in a hot oven. 

Cheese biscuits 

Cook together in a small saucepan three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter and four of flour. When these are blended pour upon them a 
half pint of boiling water and stir until thick and smooth; add 
four tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, a dash of celery salt and 
of cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until very thick; 
remove from the fire and add, slowly, two beaten eggs. Beat 
for ten minutes and drop by the spoonful upon a greased baking- 
pan. Drop these cakes so far apart that they will not touch 
each other. Lay a sheet of brown paper over the top of the 
pan and set in a hot oven for ten or fifteen minutes. When the 
biscuits are puffed up and seem nearly done, remove the paper 
and brown them. Slip a thin-bladed knife carefujly under the bis- 
cuits to loosen them from the pan and serve at once, as they soon 
fall. 

Cheese crackers 

On buttered crackers lay slices of American cheese cut thin* 
arrange in a baking-pan and set in the oven until the cheese is 
melted. Serve hot. A little cayenne sprinkled upon the crackers 
is liked by many. 

Cheese fingers 

Cut puff-paste into strips as long and as wide as your middle 
finger, sprinkle with a layer of cheese (grated), press upon this 
another strip of pastry, sprinkle with more cheese and bake in a 
quick oven. 

Cream cheese 

To every quart of rich milk you use allow a pinch of salt and a 
teaspoonful of rennet, taking care to buy that which is not flavored 
in any way. When it is solid, turn into a bag and let it drip- 
When it is well drained so that all the whey is taken from the 
curd it may take more than a day for this, and in that case you 



202 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

must change the bag at the end of the first twelve hours take it 
out, chop the curd fine, put it into a cheese box and press two 
hours. Wrap in two or three folds of tissue paper or in tinfoil, 
to exclude the air. 

Deviled crackers and cheese 

Butter thin crackers water, butter, cream or saltine dip each 
lightly into hot milk and lay in a buttered bake-dish. Sprinkle 
the layers with salt and paprika and every other layer with a 
spatter of French mustard. Cover each layer with dry, grated 
cheese. The topmost layer should be soaked crackers dotted with 
butter. Finally, pour in a cup of milk, heated, with a pinch of 
soda. Cover closely for the first half-hour of baking, then brown 
delicately. 

Creamed cheese golden buck 

This is a good way of using cream cheese which has become 
a little dry after the tinfoil has been removed. 

Rub three tablespoonfuls of cream cheese to a paste with a tea- 
spoonful of butter ; salt and pepper it and work in a tablespoonf ul 
or two of cream, enough to make it quite soft. Set in a pan of 
boiling water over the fire and stir until hot, when add a beaten 
egg, cook one minute and spread upon buttered crackers. 

Nonpareil Welsh rarebit 

Half a pound of soft grated cheese ; one gill of ale ; two eggs ; 
one tablespoonf ul of butter; one teaspoonful of lemon juice and 
the same of Worcestershire sauce and half a spoonful of celery 
salt. A pinch of cayenne and one of mustard. 

Put a broad saucepan over the fire and melt the butter. When 
it hisses stir in the cheese, then, still stirring, the dry seasoning. 
Have ready the eggs beaten separately and very light, before you 
stir them together in a bowl with a few swift strokes. Add three 
spoonfuls of the hot mixture to these, rapidly, then pour the eggs 
(now warmed by the hot cheese) into the saucepan, never letting 
the spoon rest. In one minute more add the sauce and lemon 
juice and put upon rounds of hot, buttered toast. 



CREAMED MACARONI IN PINEAPPLE CHEESE SHELL 




COVERED CHEESE DISH FOR LIMBURGER, ETC. 

CHEESE AND EGG-ENTRFES 



CHEESE DISHES FOR LUNCHEON 203 

Macaroni in cheese shell 

Break macaroni into two-inch lengths and boil until tender 
in plenty of salted water ; then drain and blanch by pouring cold 
water over it. After it has been blanched cut into pieces not over 
a half inch long. Have ready a cheese-shell, one from which the 
cheese has been thoroughly scooped out. These shells, which 
are frequently thrown away, make a nice receptacle for serving 
macaroni. Stand the shell on a piece of waxed paper and this 
in a baking-pan. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of 
flour in the saucepan, mix and add a pint of milk, stir until 
boiling, mix in the cold macaroni and stir over the fire until 
it is just heated through; add a teaspoonful of salt and salt- 
spoonful of pepper and pour the mixture into the shell ; cover with 
a piece of greased paper and leave in the oven fifteen minutes. 
Lift the shell carefully, putting it on a round plate and send to 
the table. This process imparts a most delicate cheese flavor and 
makes a sightly dish. If baked too long, it will become soft and 
fall apart. For that reason the macaroni must be hot when poured 
into the shell. If the shell is carefully cleaned, it may be used 
several times. 

Cream celery in Edam cheese shell 

Cut the cleaned celery stalks into inch-lengths and cook until 
tender in boiling water, slightly salted. For three cupfuls of the 
cut celery allow a pint of white sauce, using the water in which the 
celery was cooked, with the cream, as the liquid. Turn into the 
shell of an Edam cheese, cover with half a cupful of fine cracker- 
crumbs, mixed with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and let 
it brown in the oven. Send around powdered cheese with this 
dish. 

Cheese rings 
(Contributed) 

Prepare a dough as for cheese straws, but cut it out with a 
doughnut cutter, brown slightly in a moderate oven. Draw sev- 
eral cheese straws through the opening in each ring and serve 
with salad. 



204 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Baked cheese 

(Contributed) 

Dissolve three ounces of butter in a gill of hot water. Melt 
three ounces each of American and Gruyere cheese. Stir all to- 
gether until creamy, then add enough sifted flour to make a stiff 
paste and the beaten yolks of two eggs. Mix the whole thor- 
oughly. Mold with two buttered tablespoons, slip on greased 
paper, and when all are molded set in a moderate oven. When 
slightly brown brush them over with the whites of the eggs beaten 
stiff. Return to the oven for one minute. Take up on a hot 
dish, dust with pepper and fill the center with grated cheese. 

Cheese cutlets 
(Contributed) 

To the well-beaten yolks of three eggs add one tablespoonful of 
cream and one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese and season with 
mace and cayenne. Beat until very light and add one tablespoon- 
ful of Bechamel sauce. Pour into a buttered pan and steam over 
hot water until firm. When cold cut in shapes with a fancy 
cutter, dredge with grated cheese and fry in boiling fat to a deli- 
cate brown. Serve at once on fried bread. 



THE TOAST FAMILY 



Toast, pure and simple 

Pare the crust from thin slices of bread, cut each slice in two 
and toast to a golden brown over a clear fire ; butter lightly ; pile 
together and throw a napkin over them. The sooner they are eaten 
the better. This toast is the accompaniment to scores of break- 
fast and luncheon dishes. 



Brown bread toast 

Is especially good and goes well with oysters and certain salads. 

Deviled toast 

Is best when made of stale whole wheat or of graham bread. 
Toast as just directed and spread with a mixture made by cream- 
ing together a great spoonful of butter with a quarter-teaspoon- 
ful, each, of lemon juice, dry mustard and paprika. Sift, if you 
like, dry grated cheese over each round of toast thus deviled and 
set for one minute upon the upper grating of a hot oven. Eat at 
once. 

Tomato toast 

Make a pint of well-seasoned tomato sauce. Toast crustless 
slices of bread ; butter and dip each slice in hot, salted milk, then 
put the slices in layers in a pudding dish. Put a spoonful of to-, 
mato sauce on each layer, and when the dish is full, pour the re- 
maining sauce over all. Cover and set in the oven for ten min- 
utes, then send to the table. It will be found very good.

206 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Celery toast 

Stew inch-lengths of celery until soft ; run through a vegetable 
press ; mix with a thin white sauce, seasoning with paprika, salt 
and a dash of onion juice; boil up once and put into a pudding 
dish with alternate layers of lightly toasted bread which have 
been dipped into the salted water poured off from the boiled cel- 
ery. Cover and set in the oven for ten minutes, then serve in 
the bake-dish. A pleasant accompaniment to chicken or veal 
croquettes. 

Sandwiched toast 

Cut bread into very thin slices and remove all the crusts. But- 
ter lightly, and between every two slices lay an extremely thin 
shaving of chicken or cold roast veal. Press the slices of bread 
firmly together, lay on a toaster and toast each to a delicate 
brown. Serve at once. These are especially nice with cucumber 
salad. 

Toasted crackers 

Butter seafoam or snowflake crackers and dust with celery salt 
and a little paprika. Set in the oven until very hot, then serve. 

Toasted anchovy crackers 

Spread crackers with anchovy paste and set in the oven until 
very hot before sending to the table. 



LUNCHEON VEGETABLES 

Hashed potatoes, browned 

Pare, wash and cut eight fine potatoes into small cubes, not 
more than half an inch square. Put these over the fire with two 
tablespoonfuls of minced celery and half as much grated onion. 
Salt to taste, and cook until tender but not broken ; drain off the 
water and turn the potatoes into a buttered dish. Have ready a 
cupful of hot milk, into which stir a large tablespoonful of butter 
rubbed into one of flour. Do not cook them together, but add a 
tablespoonful of finely-minced parsley, and pour over the potatoes. 
Cover and bake fifteen minutes, then brown upon the upper grat- 
ing of your oven. Serve in the bake-dish. 

The celery and onion impart a most agreeable flavor to the 
dish. 

Potato scallop 

Work gradually into your cold mashed potato a cupful of 
warmed milk (in which has been dissolved a pinch of soda) until 
you have a smooth mixture ; season with pepper and salt, add an 
egg beaten very light, and bake briskly in a well-greased pudding 
dish. Serve in the dish before it has time to fall. 

Potato chips 

Pare, slice very thin with a sharp knife and throw into ice 
water for an hour. Dry between two towels, and cook until deli- 
cately colored in deep, boiling cottolene or the best salad oil, slight- 
ly salted. Drain perfectly dry, toss upon hot tissue paper for an 
instant and serve in a deep dish lined with a napkin, which is 
drawn over the potatoes. 

207 



208 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Potato strips 

Prepare in the same way, after cutting into long, thin strips, 
the length of the potato. 

Potatoes on the half -shell 

Bake large, smooth potatoes of uniform size until they yield' to 
the pinching fingers. Divide each carefully in half, lengthwise ; 
scrape out the interior, taking care not to break the skin ; mash 
the potato with a little hot milk and melted butter until you can 
beat it to a cream ; salt and pepper, beat in two tablespoonfuls of 
grated cheese (Parmesan is best) for two cupfuls of potato, and 
return to the waiting shells. Set in the oven until hot through 
and slightly browned. Serve in the skins. 

They are very good. 

Potato puff 

Beat a cupful of mashed potato to a soft, creamy mass, with a 
cupful of warm milk and an even tablespoonful of butter. Have 
ready two eggs, whipped light, and add to the "cream." Pepper 
and salt to your liking ; turn into a warmed and buttered pudding 
dish; set in a quick oven and bake, covered, for half an hour, 
then brown. Serve at once before it falls. 

Potato drop cakes 

Pare, wash and grate six good-sized raw potatoes ; press out the 
water, add three well-beaten eggs and a heaping tablespoonful of 
flour, with salt to taste. Beat well, and drop by the great spoon- 
ful in deep, hot cottolene or other fat. Fry to a delicate brown. 

Sweet potatoes au gratin 

Peel and slice cold, boiled sweet potatoes. Grease a pudding 
dish, put a layer of potatoes in the bottom of it, sprinkle with salt, 
pepper, sugar and bits of butter. Put in more potatoes, sprinkle 
these as you did the others, and when the dish is full pour over the 



LUNCHEON VEGETABLES 209 

contents a gill of boiling water, in which a tablespoonful of butter 
has been melted. Strew with fine crumbs, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and bake, covered, for twenty minutes. Uncover and 
brown. 

Sweet potato puff 

Into two cupfuls of boiled and mashed sweet potatoes beat 
three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a cupful of milk and four 
beaten eggs. Salt to taste, beat hard and turn into a greased 
pudding dish. Bake to a golden brown. 



Pea pancakes 

Open a can of green peas several hours before you wish to 
use them, drain in a colander and cover with cold water until you 
are ready to cook them. Boil tender in water slightly salted, 
drain, and while hot rub through a colander or vegetable press. 
Work in a teaspoonful of butter, with pepper and salt to taste. 
Stir for a minute, and let the paste get cold. Beat two eggs light 
and add to the cold paste, alternately with a cupful of milk. Sift 
half a teaspoonful of baking powder twice with four tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, and stir into the mixture. 

Drop upon a soapstone griddle as you would griddle cakes. 
Eat while hot, as a vegetable. Peas left over from yesterday 
are nice made up in this way. 

t* 

Buttered rice 

This, too, is a nice "made-over entree." Boil rice in the usual 
way, and, after draining well, press while warm into a bowl or 
mold. Next day turn it out carefully upon a pie plate and set in a 
quick oven. When it is hot all through draw to the door of the 
oven and butter abundantly. Shut the oven, door and brown 
lightly. Butter again and sift a thick coating of grated cheese 
(Parmesan, if you have it) over all. Leave in the oven for a few 
minutes to melt the cheese, and heap irregularly with a meringue 
14 



210 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

of the whites of two eggs beaten up with a pinch of celery salt. 
Brown very lightly, slip a spatula under the mold and transfer 
carefully to a hot platter. 

It is a pretty yet a simple side dish, good and easily made. 

Tomatoes farcies 

Carefully peel large, firm tomatoes, and scoop out the centers. 
In the hollow thus left in each tomato put a layer of minced ham. 
Set the tomatoes in a bake-pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
put a bit of butter upon the top of each and cook for ten minutes. 
Then drop upon the mince in each tomato a raw egg; dust with 
salt and pepper and cook until the eggs are "set." 

_ : ; & 

Tomato cups and saucers 

Cut the tops from large, ripe tomatoes, and scoop out the in- 
sides with a small spoon. Keep these insides for the sauce, to be 
used later. Make a mince of cold roast beef or mutton, moisten 
it with a rich gravy, season to taste and half fill the hollowed 
tomatoes with this mixture. Set in a covered roasting-pan and 
bake for twenty minutes in a steady oven. Meanwhile, strain the 
tomato pulp, heat it and make of it a sauce thickened with two 
teaspoonfuls, each, of flour and butter, rubbed to a paste. Season 
to taste. Toast rounds of crustless bread, lay these on a platter 
and pour the tomato sauce over and around them. Keep hot until 
the tomatoes are ready. When these have cooked for twenty min- 
utes remove the cover of the roaster and drop into each half- 
filled tomato a raw egg. Replace the cover and bake just long 
enough to "set" the eggs. Upon each round of toast lay a stuffed 
tomato, sprinkle with pepper and salt and send to the table. 

Scallop of tomatoes and eggs 

Into a pint of stewed tomatoes stir a generous cupful of fine 
bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of melted butter, a half teaspoonful 
of sugar, pepper and salt to taste. Mix thoroughly and turn into 
a greased pudding dish. Upon the top of this scallop break as 



LUNCHEON VEGETABLES 211 

many eggs as will lie upon it side by side. Sprinkle with salt, 
pepper and bits of butter and bake until the eggs are set. 

Rice and cheese pudding 

Boil a cup of rice until each grain is tender and stands alone. 
Now beat in gradually five whipped eggs and a cup of milk, in 
which have been stirred two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. 
Stir over the fire for a minute and pour the mixture into a greased 
pudding dish. Bake in a good oven for half an hour. 

Pilau of green peppers 

Cut green peppers lengthwise, removing the seeds with care, 
lest they make the green shells too hot. Fill the halves with 
boiled rice, into which has been stirred a tablespoonful of melted 
butter for a cupful of the boiled rice, and two tablespoonfuls of 
grated Parmesan cheese, with salt to taste. Mound the rice 
smoothly and high, and after the pilau has cooked ten minutes in 
a covered pan brown lightly. Serve hot. 

Scallop of sweet peppers and ham 

Cut each pepper lengthwise into quarters and remove the seeds 
carefully, lay in iced water for fifteen minutes, then drain. Cut 
each quarter in half. Butter a pudding dish and put in the bot- 
tom of it a layer of minced ham, on top of this a layer of cut 
peppers ; sprinkle thickly with fine crumbs and moisten all thor- 
oughly with seasoned stock. Now put in more ham, another layer 
of peppers and crumbs, liberally dotted with bits of butter and 
sprinkled with salt. Bake, covered, in a good oven for half an 
hour, then uncover and cook ten minutes longer. 

Buttered rice with peppers 

Cook an even cupful of rice fast in two quarts of salted boiling 
water for twenty minutes, or until tender, but not broken. Drain 
in a colander, and set in an open oven to dry off for five minutes. 



212 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Have ready one large, or two small green sweet peppers, seeded 
carefully and chopped fine. Put a heaping tablespoonful of but- 
ter in a frying-pan ; when it hisses add the minced peppers ; toss 
and stir over the fire until smoking hot all through. Put the rice 
into a dish and pour the contents of the frying-pan all over 
it, loosening the mass with a fork to allow the sauce to pene- 
trate it. 

Boston baked beans 

Soak one quart of beans over night in warm not hot water. 
In the morning cook them until the skin curls on a bean when you 
blow upon it. Pack them in an earthen pot. Score the skin of 
a pound of streaked salt pork, and almost bury it in the beans. 
Pour over this one dessertspoonful of molasses, mixed with as 
much vinegar, a good pinch of pepper and a teaspoonful of mixed 
mustard. Cover closely and bake six hours in a good oven. 

Baked beans and tomatoes 

Soak and boil as directed in the last recipe. Then put the 
beans into a deep pudding dish ; bury a piece of pork (parboiled) 
in the center and pour over them a large cupful of stewed and 
strained tomatoes seasoned with pepper, sugar, onion juice and a 
good lump of butter, but not thickened. Cover closely and cook 
for three hours, if the dish be large. 

Fried cucumbers 

Peel and slice cucumbers and lay in a dressing of equal parts of 
oil and vinegar for ten minutes. Drain and dip in beaten egg, 
roll in cracker crumbs and fry in deep cottolene or other fat. 
Drain and serve hot. 

Mushrooms on toast 

Peel and broil fresh mushrooms, spread them with butter, dust 
with salt and pepper, and serve them on rounds of toast. Or 
you may cut the mushrooms in quarters, put them in a double 
boiler with a tablespoonful of butter and cook until tender. They 



LUNCHEON VEGETABLES 213 

may then be seasoned to taste and poured, sauce and all, on 
rounds or triangles of crustless toast 

Baked mushrooms 

Peel and stem large mushrooms. Line a deep bake-dish with 
thin slices of toast, each of which has been dipped for an instant 
in seasoned beef stock. Fill the dish with layers of mushrooms, 
sprinkling each layer with salt, paprika, and bits of butter. When 
the dish is full, pour over all a gill of stock, and bake, covered, for 
twenty minutes. Uncover and cook for five minutes before send- 
ing to the table. 

Dried mushrooms and eggs 

Wash the dried mushrooms, boil until tender and drain the 
water off. Put into a pan to fry in butter for about ten minutes, 
sprinkle a very little caraway seed on them, and salt to taste. 
Break a few eggs over them. 



SANDWICHES 

THE day has passed and forever when a sandwich meant two 
thick slices of bread, enclosing what the boys call a "hunk" of 
cold meat. Now the popular delicacy is made of bread cut to 
wafer-like thinness and shorn of all suggestion of crust. The 
" filling" may be simple or composite, as taste may dictate, and the 
ingenious housewife will devise many delicious combinations to be 
spread between the two layers of her sandwiches. 

Ham sandwiches 

Chop lean ham fine and beat into each cupful of the minced 
meat a tablespoonful of salad oil, a teaspoon ful of vinegar, a salt- 
spoonful of French mustard, six olives chopped fine, and a tea- 
spoonful of minced parsley. Work all to a paste and spread on 
thin slices of white bread. 

Chicken sandwiches 

Mince the white meat of a roast chicken and mix it with half a 
can of French mushrooms, chopped fine, and a half cupful of 
chopped English walnuts. Season to taste with pepper and salt, 
and moisten with melted butter. Put the mixture between slices 
of whole wheat bread. 

Brunette sandwiches 

Slice Boston brown bread very thin, butter lightly, and spread 
with Neufchatel or with cottage cheese. Have ready crisp lettuce- 
leaves, dip each in a bowl of French salad dressing, then lay on the 
already spread brown bread. Press another slice of buttered 
brown bread on this, and the sandwich is ready. These sand- 

214 



SANDWICHES 215 

wiches must be kept in a moist atmosphere until it is time to serve 
them. 

Lamb or mutton sandwiches 

Mince cold roast lamb, or tender mutton fine, and season with 
salt, pepper and tomato catsup. Add a few minced olives and 
make all into a paste with mayonnaise dressing. Spread between 
thin slices of bread. Cut these sandwiches into diamond shapes. 

Beef sandwiches 

Chop rare cold roast beef very fine, taking care to use only 
the lean portions of the meat. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and a 
saltspoonful of horseradish. Mix and make into sandwiches with 
thinly-sliced graham bread. These may be eaten by persons of 
delicate digestion, and are both appetizing and nourishing. 

Egg sandwiches 

Mash the yolks of hard-boiled eggs to a powder and moisten 
with olive oil and a few drops of vinegar. Work to a paste, add 
salt, pepper and French mustard to taste, with a drop or two of 
Tabasco sauce. Now chop the whites of the eggs as fine as pos- 
sible (or until they are like a coarse powder) and mix them with 
the yolk paste. If more seasoning is necessary, add it before 
spreading the mixture upon sliced graham bread. 

Walnut sandwiches 

Shell English walnuts. Blanch and chop, and to every table- 
spoonful of nuts allow a good half tablespoonful of cream cheese. 
Rub well together and spread on thin slices of crustless white or 
graham bread. 

Peanut sandwiches 

Shell and skin freshly-roasted peanuts and roll them to fine 
crumbs on a pastry-board. Add salt to taste, and mix the pow- 
dered nuts with enough fresh cream cheese to make a paste that 



216 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

can be easily spread on unbuttered bread. Keep in a cold, damp 
place until wanted. 

Water cress sandwiches 

Season water cress with salt, pepper, and a few drops of vine- 
gar, and chop coarsely. Mix with creamy cottage cheese and 
spread on thinly-sliced white bread. 

Cottage cheese sandwiches 

Cottage cheese, spread upon a slice of buttered bread, and cov- 
ered with a leaf of lettuce dipped in oil and vinegar, then with 
the second buttered slice, makes a nice relish. 

Sardine sandwiches 

Wipe the fish, skin, take out the backbone and rub to a smooth 
paste with a little butter and lemon juice. Add a dash of cay- 
enne, or a few drops of Tabasco sauce, and spread between thin 
slices of brown bread. 

Salmon sandwiches 

* 

(Contributed) 

Remove the skin and bones from a can of calmon, shred with a 
silver fork and add the crumbled yolks of six hard-boiled eggs. 
Season to taste and add any good salad dressing. Spread on thin 
slices of brown bread. 

Olive sandwiches 

(Contributed) 

Take equal parts of large and stuffed olives. Mince fine, mix 
with a little thick mayonnaise, and spread on thin slices of but- 
tered bread. 

Salad sandwiches 

(Contributed) 

Take finely-chopped chicken or veal, season with salt, pepper 
and a dash of onion juice. Add a little mayonnaise and spread 
the mixture on thin slices of bread lined with crisp lettuce leaves.

TEMPTING PREFIXES TO LUNCHEON 

Grape fruit 

This is among the most popular of appetizers to be served at a 
luncheon. Cut the fruit in half, crosswise, and with a sharp knife 
remove all the bitter white membrane that divides the lobes. Fill 
the space thus left with as much granulated sugar as the fruit 
will hold. Set on the ice until very cold. 

Fruit baskets 

Cut oranges in half so cleverly as to leave a wide strip from the 
upper half of the rind attached to the lower, like the handle of a 
basket, or the "bale" of a bucket. Should you break it at one 
side you can, after filling the cup or basket, put a neat stitch in 
and tie a bow of narrow ribbon over the join. 

Empty the lower cup entirely to the white inner lining. Set 
on the ice while you prepare the filling. Cut the orange pulp 
into neat, clean bits; mix with crystallized cherries, atoms of 
marrons glaces or of blanched nuts, add fine white sugar and a 
little liqueur, or if you prefer, sherry. Fill the baskets and leave 
half buried in cracked ice until you are ready to set them on the 
table. 

Set each basket upon a chilled plate, laying an orange spoon 
beside it. 

If you do not care to take the trouble of leaving the handle on, 
make bowls of the halved fruit. They are a delicious introduc- 
tion to a company luncheon. 

Oyster cocktails 

Bury small oysters in the ice until needed. Have the tall, slen- 
der glasses in which they are to be served laid in the ice also that 

221 



222 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

they may be thoroughly chilled. Make a sauce of two tablespoon- 
fuls of tomato catsup, a dozen drops of Tabasco sauce, the juice 
of a lemon, a saltspoonful of grated horseradish and a dash, each, 
of salt and paprika. Add two tablespoonfuls of oyster liquor, 
mix thoroughly and set on the ice until very cold. 

Put five oysters in the bottom of each chilled glass, pour the 
sauce upon them, and serve. 

Raw oysters 

Lay, when opened, on the deeper of the halved shells that the 
liquor may not escape. Have a bed of finely-cracked ice in each 
plate, fix five oysters in each bed, with a piece of lemon in the 
middle. Pass grated horseradish in vinegar with them, and small 
crackers, or buttered bars of graham bread. 

Raw clams 

Are served in the same way. 

Caviar crisps 

Remove the crusts from slices of white bread and cut into strips 
an inch wide and three inches long. Toast to a light brown and 
set aside to cool. Open a small can of caviar and rub into the 
contents a tablespoonful of salad oil and a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice. If the paste is not soft enough add more oil. Spread the 
crisp toast with this paste, garnish with sprigs of parsley, and 
serve cold. 

Clam wafers 

Chop a dozen soft clams very, very fine, and season with pepper 
and a few drops of lemon juice. Add to them the beaten yolk of 
one egg and enough finely-rolled cracker crumbs to make a soft 
paste. Spread seafoam wafers thickly with this paste, lay them 
in a baking pan and set in the oven for five or ten minutes, or until 
the wafers and paste are very hot and the batter is quite stiff. 
Serve at once.

Anchovy toast 

Cut the crust from a loaf of graham bread and slice, then cut 
each slice in half and toast on both sides. Spread lightly with 
butter. Open a jar of anchovies and lay one of the tiny fish on 
each strip of graham toast, squeeze a few drops of lemon juice 
upon it, sprinkle with paprika and set in the oven until very hot. 

Anchovy bars 

Butter narrow saltine wafers, spread them with anchovy paste, 
and set them in the oven long enough to become very hot. Serve 
two on each plate. 

Deviled crackers 

Butter seafoam wafers, sprinkle lightly with paprika, then drop 
upon them a very little grated Parmesan cheese, and set in the 
oven until they brown delicately about the edges. 

Hot-house grapes 

Cut the larger bunches into smaller, all of uniform size. Lay 
on ice until just before luncheon when, tie a dainty bow of ribbon 
of a harmonizing color with the grapes, upon each bunch. 

Jack Frost grapes 

Divide a large bunch of selected grapes into smaller bunches of 
even proportion. With a earners-hair brush varnish each grape 
thoroughly with the white of an egg. Dust carefully with granu- 
lated sugar. Tie to each cluster a bow of narrow white ribbon. 



SALADS 

IN A Familiar Talk, some pages back, I have alluded to the 
"Woman with a Way," who will not use oil in salad dressing. 
A story which stuck to an eminent magazine publisher to the end 
of his busy career was of a new cook whose salads won the un- 
qualified approval of her master, who was a gourmand in a 
gentlemanly way. She had been serving perfect mayonnaises 
and well-adjusted French dressings for a fortnight, when one of 
the children fell ill and the doctor prescribed a dose of castor oil. 
The mother recollected distinctly the purchase of a bottle not 
long before, but it could not be found. Bridget heard the inquiry 
going the rounds and came to the front. 

"Castor ile is it ye are wanting? And it is mesilf that was 
thinking this morning, as I had a right to spake to yez, mem, to 
order more. I put the lasht dhrop inter the castor yisterday. 
Salad every day uses a dale of ile." 

Bridget knows better now, and her mistress's taste is so far 
cultivated by much use of salad oil that she insists upon having it 
"pure." 

An airy waitress, in the second day of her trial week in my 
household, complimented me patronizingly upon the judgment 
which led me to select "the best brand." 

"There's no better oil on the market to my way of thinking than 
the Borducks !" holding a bottle up to let the light fall through the 
slow liquid amber of "Huile de Bordeaux." 

The oil of Bordeaux is good, when not doctored upon this side 
of the water. There are olive groves in other foreign lands that 
send thousands of gallons of pure oil to America to be mixed with 
cheaper oils, returned to the bottles bearing foreign labels, and 
palmed off upon the most credulous public upon the globe as the 
yield of the royal olive. 

224 



SALADS 225 

Pure salad oil, when it has any perceptible odor, should have a 
faint "nutty" perfume; it should taste like the ripe olives from 
which it was expressed; in color it should be palest, tenderest 
green ; it should blend readily and harmoniously with condiments 
and with the body of the salad. 

French dressing 

Rub the inside of a bowl with a clove of garlic. Measure into 
a bowl six tablespoonfuls of oil, two of vinegar, two saltspoonfuls 
of salt, and one of pepper. Mix thoroughly before pouring over 
the salad. 

Mayonnaise dressing 

Into a chilled soup plate drop the yolk of an egg drained free 
of all the white, squeeze upon it a teaspoonful of lemon juice and 
stir in with a silver fork until well mixed. Now add gradually 
a few drops of salad oil, stirring steadily. As the dressing thick- 
ens, add the oil more freely until you have used half a pint. 
Season with a dash of paprika, a half teaspoonful of salt, a salt- 
spoonful of mustard, and a generous tablespoonful of vinegar. 

In making your chicken salad allow a cupful of celery cut into 
bits to every two cups of the chicken dice, and make a cupful of 
mayonnaise for five cupfuls of the salad. 

Cream dressing 

Beat three eggs, yolks and whites together, until they are very 
light; add one teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of red pepper, half a 
saltspoonful of mustard mixed with a little water, and, lastly, 
three or four tablespoonfuls of rich, sweet cream. 

Sonr cream salad dressing 

Have a cupful of rich sour cream very cold, then beat hard for 
five minutes, adding, as you do so, a tablespoonful of powdered 
sugar and a half teaspoonful of lemon juice. This dressing is 
delicious served with chilled cucumbers, sliced thin.

226 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Boiled salad dressing 

Into three well-beaten eggs stir a cupful of vinegar, a table- 
spoonful of sugar, two saltspoonfuls of salt, a dash of paprika, and 
a small teaspoonful of French mustard. Beat thoroughly, turn into 
a saucepan, stir steadily until the boil begins, and add a teaspoon- 
ful of butter. When this melts remove the dressing from the fire. 
Beat for two minutes and set aside to cool. When cold put in 
the ice-box, where it will keep a week or ten days. 

Chicken salad 

Cut cold, boiled chicken into small dice. With two cupfuls of 
this meat mix a cupfuj of celery cut into dice. Sprinkle all with 
salt and pepper. Into three tablespoonfuls of oil stir a table- 
spoonful of vinegar. Pour this over the chicken and celery and 
toss until well mixed. Line a chilled bowl with crisp lettuce 
leaves, fill with the chicken salad and pour mayonnaise dressing 
over all. 

Turkey salad 

Is made in like manner, rejecting the dark meat of the legs, 
unless it is very tender. 

Lobster salad 

Pick out the meat from a fresh, well-boiled lobster. Cut with 
a sharp knife into small dice, taking care not to tear the meat. 
Set on ice while you make a good mayonnaise, which, in turn, 
must go on the ice. Have ready one-third as much celery as you 
have lobster, cut into half -inch lengths. Mix together in a bowl, 
sprinkle with cayenne and salt and stir lightly into it a cupful of 
mayonnaise. Line a chilled bowl with crisp lettuce, arrange the 
salad within this; garnish with the lobsters' claws and hard- 
boiled eggs cut into lengths lengthwise. Set on ice until it goes to 
table. 

Crab salad 

Is made in the same way, omitting the eggs from the gar- 
nish. 



SALADS 227 

Oyster salad 

Choose small oysters for this salad. If you can not get these, 
cut each oyster in half, but do not chop them. Drain the liquor 
from the oysters, and to every cupful of these add a cupful of crisp 
white celery cut into half-inch bits sprinkled lightly with salt. 
Mix and stir mayonnaise dressing through the mixture. Line a 
chilled bowl with lettuce leaves, fill with the oyster salad and pour 
a rich mayonnaise over all. Garnish with stoned olives. 

Shrimp salad 

For this dish you can use either the fresh or the canned shrimps. 
If the former, they must be shelled. If the latter, they must be 
taken from the can several hours before they are to be used and 
set on the ice. Line a salad bowl with crisp lettuce leaves, lay 
the shrimps upon these and cover with mayonnaise dressing. 
Serve at once. 

Shrimp and tomato salad 

Cut the tops from ripe tomatoes and remove the insides. Fill 
the tomato shells with cold boiled shrimps, with their backs up; 
set each tomato upon a leaf of lettuce and pour mayonnaise dress- 
ing over all. A pretty salad. 

Grab and tomato salad 

Carefully strip the skin from six large, firm tomatoes, and re- 
move the centers. Fill the hollowed vegetables with the chopped 
and seasoned meat of six boiled crabs. Set the stuffed tomatoes 
in the ice for several hours. Lay on crisp lettuce leaves, and put 
a spoonful of mayonnaise dressing upon each tomato. 

Shrimp salad and tomato aspic 

Strain the liquor from a can of tomatoes through coarse muslin. 
Put over the fire, season with salt and paprika and the strained 
juice of a small onion. When it boils skim well and pour over 



228 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

half a box of Coxe's gelatine, which has been soaked three hours 
in a cup of cold water. Set away to form into a jelly. 

When ready to use it line a salad dish with lettuce, arrange the 
contents of a can of shrimps (strained) upon the leaves, and 
spoonfuls of tomato jelly upon the shrimps. Send around French 
salad dressing with it. 

Salmon mayonnaise 

Boil eight eggs hard, throw into cold water ; peel and lay in ice. 
Make a cup of mayonnaise and rub into it five large clean-cut 
pieces of canned salmon. Slice the eggs, lay them on lettuce 
leaves and pour over them the salmon mayonnaise. 



Sardine salad 

Drain the oil from a box of sardines and squeeze three drops 
of lemon juice on each fish. Lay crisp lettuce leaves in iced water 
for half an hour, then shake free of moisture and lay on a chilled 
platter. On each leaf lay a sardine, and upon this pour a spoon- 
ful of thick mayonnaise dressing. Garnish the edge of the plat- 
ter with cold boiled beets cut into star shapes. Serve with crack- 
ers and cream cheese. 



Egg salad with sardine mayonnaise 

Boil eight eggs hard, throw into cold water ; peel and lay in the 
ice. Make a cup of mayonnaise and rub into it four sardines 
that have been skinned and mashed to a paste. Halve the eggs, 
lay them on crisp lettuce leaves and pour a spoonful of the sar- 
dine mayonnaise over all. 



Egg salad with boiled dressing 

Beat smooth the yolks of three eggs with one teaspoonful of 
sugar, a half teaspoonful of mustard, one-half teaspoonful of salt, 



SALADS 229 

dash of celery salt, one cup of vinegar and one cup of milk, 
added alternately to prevent curdling, and two tablespoonfuls of 
oil; put into double boiler and cook to the consistency of thin 
custard, stirring all the time. Let it get perfectly cold. Line a 
chilled dish with lettuce leaves, heap hard-boiled eggs, cut into 
quarters, upon these and pour over them the dressing. 

Simple lettuce salad 

Unless you have an exceptionally deft and cool-fingered cook 
or waiter, make the salad on the table yourself. Have, first, a 
finger-bowl passed quietly to you, into which dip your fingers, 
drying them on your napkin. While you do this the waitress or 
butler should set before you the oil, vinegar, pepper and salt, 
with salad spoon and fork and a small bowl, in the bottom of 
which is a tablespoonful of finely-minced green chives. If you 
have not these, the inside of the bowl should have been rubbed 
well with garlic. Mix in the bowl of the spoon a teaspoonful of 
salt with half as much pepper; fill the large spoon with vinegar, 
mixing salt and pepper well in this ; turn into the mixing bowl ; 
then fill the spoon three times with oil. Stir and toss until the 
ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. Two larger bowls 
should be ready at hand, one empty, the other heaped with crisp, 
cold lettuce leaves. Pick these apart lightly with the tips of your 
fingers and put into the empty bowl. When all are in pour the 
dressing over the lettuce, tossing lightly and quickly with salad 
fork and spoon. Pass at once with heated crackers and fancy 
cheese of some kind. 

Lettuce and tomato salad 

After tearing the lettuce apart, lay, as on a bed, tomatoes pared 
and sliced, or cut into eighths. Pour the dressing over them. 

Salad should never be touched with one's own knife, but di- 
vided, if need be, with the fork. It should not be necessary to 
remind people who know anything of the by-laws of dining and 
lunching as received by polite society, that it is awkward and un- 



230 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

conventional to hash tender lettuce, celery or cress with knife 
and fork, clinking against the plate in a castanet accompaniment 
to table talk. Yet it is done in our sight and hearing almost every 
day. 

Water cress salad 

Tear apart gingerly, pile in a bowl, and pour a French dressing 
over it. Some like to dip it into salt, as celery is eaten, without 
other dressing. 

Potato salad (No. 1) 

Cut cold-boiled potatoes into tender slices and mix with them 
two raw white onions, minced, and a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and two table- 
spoonfuls of salad oil mixed with a dessertspoonful of vinegar. 
Toss and turn, and put into a salad bowl. Set in the ice for two 
hours. Just before sending to the table stir into the salad a half 
cupful of mayonnaise, and pour the rest of the dressing over the 
top of the salad. 

Potato salad (No. 2) 

Peel eight potatoes that have been boiled in their skins and al- 
lowed to cool. Slice the potatoes into a bowl and add to them a 
chopped onion, which has been scalded after it was minced. Sea- 
son the potato and onion with salt and pepper to taste. Pour 
upon them five tablespoonfuls of oil and two of vinegar. Toss 
up well and let them stand an hour before serving. 

Cauliflower salad 

Cut a young cauliflower into clusters, boil tender, drain and 
lay in the ice until very cold. Arrange on leaves of lettuce and 
serve with mayonnaise dressing. A delicious salad. 

Eeet salad 

Boil eight young beets tender; drain, and lay in iced water 
until thoroughly chilled. Drain once more and scrape off the 



SALADS 231 

skins. Pour into a bowl six tablespoonfuls of salad oil with one 
tablespoonful of vinegar, and stir into them two saltspoonfuls, 
each, of salt and pepper. Stir this dressing thoroughly. With a 
sharp knife cut the chilled beets into tiny dice of uniform size, 
and as you do so drop these dice into the French dressing in the 
bowl. When all the beets are cut, turn them over and over in the 
dressing that they may become well coated. Set the bowl and 
its contents on the ice for an hour, or until very cold. Line a 
chilled salad bowl with crisp lettuce leaves. Drain all the dress- 
ing from the beets into a small glass bowl. Upon each lettuce 
leaf put a spoonful of the beet dice. When serving, put a spoon- 
ful of dressing upon each leaf. 

A macedoine salad 

One cup of green peas, boiled and cold, and the same of string 
beans cut into half-inch lengths, well cooked and suffered to get 
cold. One cup of celery cut into inch-lengths. One-half cup of 
boiled carrots, cut into tiny dice, also cold. One cup of red 
beets boiled and cut into small dice. Leave all these ingredients 
in the ice-box until chilled and stiff. Have ready a chilled glass 
or silver bowl a shallow one is best; heap the beets in the cen- 
ter, arrange next to them a ring of celery dice, then the beans, 
next the carrots, lastly the peas all forming a mound. Pour 
over this a good French dressing, garnish with a wreath of nas- 
turtium blooms about the base and set on the ice until needed. 
Pass, if you like, a mayonnaise dressing with it. The true salad 
lover will, however, prefer the French dressing alone. It is a 
beautiful salad and easily made. If you can not get celery in 
summer, substitute boiled corn cut from the cob to make the 
white ring. 

A fruit salad 

Pare four juicy, sweet oranges, peel off every bit of the white 
inner skin from the fruit it incloses, pull the lobes apart, and cut 
each into four pieces. 

Scald a cupful of English walnut kernels, strip away the bitter 



232 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

skin and let the kernels get dry and cold. Mix with the bits of 
orange, set on the ice for an hour, heap in a glass salad dish lined 
with crisp lettuce and cover with a good mayonnaise dressing. 

Some consider a tablespoonful of celery cut into small pieces 
an improvement to this dish. 

Apple and nut salad 

Scoop the inside from fine, smooth, tart apples, and fill them 
with a mixture of cut-up celery and walnut meats, blanched and 
chopped, the whole well moistened with mayonnaise. Slices of 
pippins are sometimes mixed with watercress and covered with 
French dressing, making a piquante salad that is especially good 
with roast duck. 

Apple and celery salad 

Cut enough crisp celery into small bits to make a cupful. Lay 
in iced water. Peel and cut four large apples into small dice, 
dropping these into water as you do so. Drain the celery and 
sprinkle it with salt. Drain the apples, mix with the celery, and 
pour over all a thick mayonnaise dressing. Serve very cold. 

Orange salad 

Peel and divide the oranges into lobes, then cut each of these 
into three pieces. Have ready four tablespoonfuls of blanched 
English walnut kernels, cold and firm, for the same number of 
oranges. In serving, put a leaf of lettuce upon each plate, a 
great spoonful of the cut oranges upon the leaf and on this last 
a spoonful of nut-meats. Pour a good mayonnaise over all. 

Bean and beet salad 

Boil a half cupful of small kidney beans. There should be a 
cupful when cooked. Cook until soft a pint of tender string 
beans, cut into inch-lengths. Boil tender four large, or six small 
red beets. Let all get stone-cold. Cut the beets, then, into tiny 
dice. In the center of a glass dish heap the beets, next the white

beans, and, as an outer circle, the green. Edge with white "heart" 
lettuce leaves, and pour a French dressing over all. 

A pretty and palatable salad. 

If you use dried white beans they must be soaked for six hours 
before boiling. 

Nasturtium salad 

Cut fine the heart of a large bunch of celery, mince a table- 
spoonful of parsley and six blades of chives. Mix with a French 
dressing, stir in lightly the petals of a dozen large nasturtium 
blossoms; line a salad bowl with crisp lettuce, and put this mix- 
ture in the center. Garnish elaborately with nasturtium leaves 
and blossoms. 

Dandelion salad 

Pick the young tender leaves of the dandelion, wash and lay in 
ice water for half an hour. Drain, shake dry and pat still drier 
between the folds of a napkin. Turn into a chilled bowl, cover 
with a French dressing, toss the greens over and over in this and 
send at once to table. 

This is very wholesome and palatable to those that like it ! 

Cabbage salad 

Shred a small white cabbage very fine. Heat a gill of vinegar, 
add to it a tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of sugar, and 
a dash of celery salt and white pepper. Bring to a boil, stir in the 
shredded cabbage, and stir until very hot. Have ready a half cup- 
ful of milk, in which a pinch of soda has been dissolved, and stir it 
slowly into three beaten eggs. Boil until it is like thick cream. 
Pour this mixture over the hot cabbage, mix well together, season 
to taste, and turn into a chilled bowl. Bury in the ice until very 
cold. 

Cold slaw 

Shred a white cabbage fine. Heat a cup of milk. Heat, also, 
a gill of vinegar, and when this last is boiling, stir into it a table- 
spoonful, each, of butter and sugar, a teaspoon ful of celery es- 



234 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

sence, two saltspoonfuls of salt and one of pepper. When boil- 
ing hard, stir in the shredded cabbage, and as soon as this is really 
hot, remove it from the fire. Pour the scalding milk slowly upon 
two beaten eggs and cook, stirring steadily until thick, then pour 
upon the cabbage and toss until well mixed. Set in the ice for 
two hours. Serve very cold. 

Cucumber salad 

Select small, firm cucumbers of uniform size. Wash well in 
cold water. Dry thoroughly. Make two incisions in the top of the 
cucumber about an inch from each end and about one-half inch 
deep. Next cut lengthwise from one incision to the other care- 
fully and remove the top. Scoop out the pulp and mix with salt. 
Then chop some celery fine (if celery is out of season substitute 
cabbage), and some blanched walnut meats, also chopped. After 
the cucumber pulp has stood about an hour in the salt drain off 
the water and add the celery and the nuts. Mix thoroughly with a 
French dressing, and about twenty minutes before serving fill 
up the shells, placing a piece of parsley in each end. 

Cucumbers with lemon juice 

Lay fresh cucumbers in the ice for twelve hours. Peel and 
slice very thin, and send immediately to the table covered with 
crushed ice. As you dish them put some of the ice on each plate 
and pour over the cucumbers a dressing made of two parts of 
salad oil and one part of lemon juice, with salt and paprika to 
taste. 

Daisy salad 

Cut two-inch rounds of cream or Neufchatel cheese one-half 
inch in thickness, and place on crisp lettuce leaves. Put the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs through the vegetable-press and place 
a teaspoonful of this yellow powder in the center of each round. 
Serve mayonnaise or French dressing in a separate bowl. 



SALADS 235 

Tongue salad 

Make a good French dressing. Dip into it firm, crisp lettuce 
leaves. Have ready cold boiled tongue, cut as thin as writing 
paper. Lay a slice upon each leaf, and serve with .heated and - 
buttered crackers. You can substitute ham for the tongue. 

Tomato aspic 

Soak a half-box of gelatine in a half-pint of water for an hour. 
Bring to a boil the liquor drained from a quart can of tomatoes, 
and add to it a teaspoonful of onion juice, two teaspoonfuls of 
sugar, a bay leaf and a teaspoonful of minced parsley, with pep- 
per and salt to taste. Simmer for twenty minutes, add the gela- 
tine, stir until dissolved, and strain through flannel into a jelly 
mold. Serve when firm, garnished with lettuce and pour over all 
a mayonnaise dressing. This jelly in culinary phrase, "aspic" 
lends itself agreeably to many combinations of salad, being sus- 
ceptible of countless variations. 

Tomatoes with whipped cream 

Carefully peel and halve ripe tomatoes and lay them on the ice 
for several hours. Transfer to a chilled platter, sprinkle with 
salt, garnish with lettuce leaves and put a great spoonful of 
whipped cream upon each tomato half. 

Tomato and corn salad 

Pour boiling water over large, smooth tomatoes to loosen the 
skins, and set on ice. When perfectly cold, gouge out the center 
of each tomato with a spoon, and fill the cavity with boiled corn 
cut from the cob and left to get perfectly cold; then mix with 
mayonnaise dressing. Arrange the tomatoes on a chilled platter 
lined with lettuce, and leave on ice until wanted. Pass more 
mayonnaise with the salad. 



236 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Tomato and peanut salad 

Prepare the tomatoes as in the last recipe. Have ready a pint 
or more of roasted peanut meats, blanched by pouring boiling 
water over them, then skinned, and when cold pounded finely 
and mixed with mayonnaise dressing. Fill the tomatoes with 
this. Serve on lettuce leaves. 

Iced tomato salad 

(Contributed) 

Cook a quart of raw tomatoes soft, strain and season with nut- 
meg, sugar, paprika, a pinch of 'grated lemon peel and salt. 
Freeze until firm ; put a spoonful upon a crisp lettuce leaf in each 
plate, cover with mayonnaise and serve immediately. It is still 
prettier if you can freeze it in round apple-shaped molds. 

Canned tomatoes may be used if you have not fresh. 

Clam salad 

(Contributed) 

Remove the skins and black heads of cold clams. Marinade 
for ten minutes in a French dressing and serve on a bed of 
shredded lettuce. 

Pear salad 

(Contributed) 

Peel and slice five sweet, ripe pears, sprinkle with fine sugar, 
and add a little maraschino or ginger syrup. Serve with a little 
cream. Or pare and slice enough ripe, sweet pears to make one 
pint ; add one-half cupful of blanched and chopped almonds, one- 
fourth of a cupful of powdered sugar and the strained juice of 
two lemons. Serve in a cup of lettuce leaves made by placing 
together the stem end of two lettuce leaves taken from the inside 
of a head of lettuce.

Hot potato salad 

(Contributed) 

Put into a frying-pan one-fourth of a pound of bacon, cut into 
dice; when light brown take out and saute in the fat a small 
onion cut fine. Add one-half as much vinegar as fat, a few 
grains of salj and cayenne and one-half as much hot stock as 
vinegar. Have ready the potatoes boiled in skins. Remove the 
skins and slice hot into the frying-pan enough to take up the 
liquid. Add the diced bacon, toss together and serve. 

Asparagus and shrimp salad

To one cupful of shrimps add two cupfuls of cold cooked 
asparagus tips, and toss lightly together. Season with salt and 
pepper. Make a dressing of the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, 
rubbed through a sieve, and sufficient oil and vinegar to make the 
consistency of cream, using twice as much oil as vinegar. Pour 
over the asparagus and shrimps. 

Asparagus salad

one-half cupful of chopped nuts. Cover well with mayonnaise 
dressing to which some whipped cream has been added. 

Green bean salad 

(Contributed) 

Select fresh string beans and boil until tender in salted water. 
Or use a good quality of canned string beans. Arrange on a dish 
and serve with mayonnaise dressing. 

Pea salad

and a dash of pepper. Serve very cold with the following dress- 
ing: Put into a double boiler the yolks of two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of stock and two tablespoonfuls of oil. Stir until 
thick, take from the fire and add slowly one tablespoonful of 
tarragon vinegar, one chopped olive and two teaspoonfuls of 
chopped parsley. 



LUNCHEON FRUITS, COOKED AND RAW 

Stewed rhubarb 

Select only good, firm stalks, and reject those that are withered. 
Lay them in cold water for an hour, and cut into half-inch pieces. 
Put them over the fire in a porcelain-lined saucepan and strew 
each layer plentifully with sugar. Pour in enough water to cover 
all, and bring very slowly to a boil. Let the rhubarb stew gently 
until it is very tender, then remove from the fire. When cold, 
serve with plain cake. 

Rhubarb and raisins 

For every cupful of raw rhubarb cut into inch lengths add a 
third as much of raisins seeded and cut in half. Cook until soft, 
as directed in last recipe. 

Rhubarb and dates 

Stone a quarter of a pound of dates, cover with hot water, and 
cook five minutes. Add three cupfuls of raw rhubarb, cut into 
inch lengths, and cook, closely covered, until the rhubarb is ten- 
der. Sweeten to taste and set aside to cool in a covered bowl, 
after which set on ice until needed. 

Rhubarb and figs 

Soak a quarter-pound of figs in warm water for two hours. 
Cut into small pieces and cook as previously directed with three 
cups of raw rhubarb, cut into inch lengths, until the rhubarb is 
tender. Eat cold. 

This dish is cooling to the blood, gently laxative and pleasing 
to the taste.

Stewed gooseberries 

Remove the tops and stems from one quart of gooseberries, 
wash and drain. Put them into a saucepan with barely enough 
boiling water to cover them. Let them stew until tender. Dis- 
solve one cupful of sugar in one-half cupful of water and boil to a 
syrup, then mix it with the fruit and set away to cool. 

Agate-nickel-steel ware is altogether the best in the market for 
stewing acid fruits. They should never be cooked in tin or in 
iron, and unless copper has just been cleaned with vinegar to 
remove all suspicion of verdigris, the use of it is dangerous. I 
can not say too much of the ware I have named. It is easily kept 
clean, durable and safe. 

Hot green apple sauce 

Utilize in this way early windfalls and unripe summer apples, 
proverbially dear to the heart of the small boy and harmful to 
his digestive organs. 

Pare and slice thin with a silver knife or with a fruit-knife of 
Swedish bronze. The crude acid forms an instant and unpleasant 
combination with steel. As you slice, drop into cold water to 
keep the color. Cook in an agate-nickel-steel saucepan, with 
just enough boiling water to keep the apples from burning to the 
bottom. Fit on a close lid and do not open the pan for half an 
hour, lest the steam escape. Shake up, and sidewise, every ten 
minutes to insure uniform steaming. When the half-hour is up 
open the saucepan, and if the apples are soft rub quickly through 
a colander of the same ware with the saucepan. Beat in sugar 
to taste, also a lump of butter about a tablespoonful to a quart 
of the stewed fruit ; turn into a covered bowl and serve hot. Pass 
thin graham bread and butter with it. 

It is wholesome, anti-bilious and palatable. 

Cold apple sauce 

Make in the same way of ripe, tart apples, a seasoning with 
mace or nutmeg to taste. When it has cooled set on ice until 
wanted. 



LUNCHEON FRUITS, COOKED AND RAW 243 

Stewed apples 

Pare and core a dozen tart, juicy apples. Put them into a 
saucepan with just enough cold water to cover them. Cook 
slowly until they are tender and clear. Then remove the apples 
to a bowl, and cover to keep hot; put the juice into a saucepan 
with a cupful of sugar, and boil for half an hour. Season with 
mace or nutmeg. Pour hot over the apples and set away cov- 
ered until cold. Eat with cream. 

Baked sweet apples 

Wash and core, but do not pare them. Arrange in a deep 
pudding-dish; put a teaspoonful of sugar and the tiniest imagi- 
nable bit of salt into the cavities left by coring; pour in a half 
cupful of water for a large dishful of apples; cover closely and 
bake in a good oven forty minutes or until soft. 

Eat ice-cold, with cream and sugar. 

Stewed prunes 

Wash dried prunes and soak them for at least five hours in 
cold water. Put them into a saucepan with enough water to 
cover them and simmer very gently for twenty minutes. Now 
add sufficient granulated sugar to sweeten liberally, and simmer 
until the prunes are tender. Take from the fire and set aside to 
cool. Eat with plain cake. 

Steamed prunes 

Soak as directed above. Place them in a covered roaster and 
steam steadily for two hours. Make a syrup in a separate vessel 
with the water left from the soaking. This recipe is especially 
suited to those who desire but little sugar in prunes, as but little 
sweetness can be added to the prunes in steaming. 

Never boil prunes, as the flavor is thereby injured. When 
cooked as directed, if the syrup is not heavy enough to suit, re- 
move the prunes from the syrup and boil the syrup down to the 
required consistency. 



244 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Stewed prunelles and sultanas 

Prunelles are more than subacid, and need the modifying in- 
fluence of sweeter fruits. Allow equal parts of prunelles and of 
the small sultana raisins. Wash the fruit in tepid water, and 
soak it in enough cold water to cover it for several hours, on the 
back of the range. Draw them forward where they will simmer 
gently until soft. Add sugar to taste, let the syrup boil up once, 
then set away to cool. 

Dried apples and peaches 

The prejudice against the dried apple of commerce is pro- 
nounced, and founded upon traditions we should have outlived. 
The kiln-dried fruit of to-day is a respectable edible and capable 
of excellent results. It is especially good if mixed with equal 
parts of dried peaches, soaked for three hours in just enough 
tepid water, to cover the fruit (having been first washed) ; then 
put over the fire with the water in which they were soaked, and 
simmer tender. Rub through a colander, add sugar, cinnamon 
and cloves to taste, and let the mixture get perfectly cold. 

Stewed cherries 

None of our small fruits are more injured by transportation 
than these same luscious and ruddy lobes. If you must buy 
cherries which are brought from a distance and are, of necessity 
several days old, cook them if you regard the welfare of the di- 
gestive organs of your family. The verse that tells us "cher- 
ries are ripe" would be more reassuring if it also informed us that 
they were recently picked. 

Wash and pick over carefully; put over the fire in a "safe" 
saucepan, such as I have already indicated, with just enough 
water to prevent burning, cover closely and stew until soft, but 
not broken. Strain off the liquor; set aside the cherries in a 
covered bowl, add three tablespoon fuls of su-ar to each pint of 
the juice, return to the fire ; boil fast for half an hour and pour 
over the fruit. Keep covered until cold. 



LUNCHEON FRUITS, COOKED AND RAW 245 

Raw cherries 

To be eaten at their raw best they should be kept in the ice- 
box until needed. Then they may be served with their stems 
still on in a glass bowl with fragments of ice scattered among 
them. 

Sugared cherries 

Use large, firm cherries for this dish. Have in front of you a 
soup-plate containing the whites of three eggs mixed with five 
tablespoonfuls of cold water, another plate filled with sifted 
powdered sugar at your right, the bowl of cherries at your left. 
Dip each cherry in the water and white of egg, turn it over and 
over in the sugar and lay on a chilled platter to dry. When all 
are done sift more powdered sugar over the fruit and arrange 
carefully on a glass dish. 

Glace cherries 

Select firm, sweet cherries from which the stems have not been 
removed. Into a perfectly clean porcelain-lined saucepan put a 
pound of granulated sugar and a gill of cold water, and boil to a 
syrup. Do not stir during the process of cooking. Try the 
syrup occasionally by dropping a little in cold water. When it 
changes to a brittle candy it is done. Remove the saucepan at 
once from the fire and set it in a pan of boiling water. Dip each 
cherry quickly in the hot syrup and lay on a waxed paper to dry. 
If the syrup shows signs of becoming too thick, add more boiling 
water to that in the outside pan. When all the cherries have been 
"dipped" stand them in a warm place to dry. 

Pineapple and orange 

Cut the top from a pineapple and carefully remove the inside, 
so that the shell may not be broken. Cut the pulp into bits, mix 
it with the pulp of three ripe oranges, also cut very small, and 
liberally sweeten the mixture. Smooth off the bottom of the 
pineapple shell so that it will stand upright, refill with the fruit 
pulp, put on the tip and set in the ice for three hours. 



246 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Creamed peaches 

Lay large, ripe free-stone peaches on the ice for several hours, 
peel, cut them in half and remove the stones. Whip half a pint 
of cream light, with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 
Fill the hollows left by the stones to heaping with the whipped 
cream. Keep in the ice-box until time to serve the fruit. 

Grapefruit and strawberries 

Cut grapefruit in half and remove the tough fiber and part of 
the pulp. Chop this pulp and add it to mashed and sweetened 
strawberries. Refill the grapefruit rinds with the mixture, and 
set on the ice for an hour or two. 

Strawberries and cream 

Cap the berries, one at a time, using the tips of your fingers. 
The practice of holding capped berries in the hollow of the hand 
until one has as many as the space will accommodate, is unclean 
and unappetizing. Cap them deftly and quickly, letting each fall 
into a chilled bowl, and do this just before serving, keeping in a 
cool place until they are ready to go to table. Pass powdered 
sugar and cream, also ice-cold, with them. 

Raspberries and cream 

Follow the directions given in last recipe. 

Bartlett pears and cream 

Select sweet, ripe pears and lay them in the ice for two hours. 
Do not peel until just before they are needed. Pare deftly and 
quickly, slice, sprinkle with sugar, cover with cream and serve. 

Bananas and cream 

Bananas are very good treated as the pears were in the last 
recipe. It is a good plan to bury these in the ice until wanted for 
dessert. Then the hostess may, at the table, quickly peel and 
slice them into different saucers. Bananas thus prepared do not 
have time to become discolored from exposure to the air. 



SWEET OMELETS 

Apple sauce omelet (baked) 

Beat the yolks of seven eggs light; stir into them five table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar and a cupful and a half of sweetened 
apple sauce. Beat long and hard, stir in the stiffened whites, 
beat for a minute longer and turn into a greased pudding-dish. 
Bake, covered, for about ten minutes, then uncover and brown. 
Serve at once with whipped cream. It is also good served with 
a hot sauce made by the following recipe : 

Into a pint of boiling water stir a half-cupful of sugar, and when 
this dissolves add a teaspoonful of butter, the juice and the 
grated rind of a lemon and the stiffened white of an egg. Beat 
for a minute over the fire, but do not let the sauce boil. 

Jam omelet 

Beat the yolks of five eggs light with a heaping tablespoonful 
of powdered sugar. Into this stir a teaspoonful of corn-starch 
dissolved in three tablespoonfuls of milk, then the stiffened whites 
of the eggs. Cook in a frying-pan until set ; spread with straw- 
berry jam, fold and serve as dessert. 

Omelet souffle 

Beat the yolks of five eggs very light, adding, gradually, four 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. In another dish whip the 
whites to a standing froth. With a few long strokes blend the 
two ; pour into a buttered bake-dish and bake quickly. Sift pow- 
dered sugar on the top at the end of two minutes, and very 
quickly, as the omelet will fall if the oven stands open even a 
few seconds. Serve at once in the bake-dish.

Orange omelet 
(Contributed) 

Beat the yolks of five eggs together until thick and lemon- 
colored. Add five tablespoonfuls of orange juice, the grated 
rind of one orange and five tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 
Then fold in lightly the beaten whites of four eggs. Put a little 
butter in an omelet pan, and when hot pour in the omelet mix- 
ture and spread in evenly. Let it cook through, but not harden. 
Fold the edges over and turn out upon a hot dish. Serve with a 
dressing of sliced oranges and powdered sugar. 

Omelet with marmalade 
(Contributed) 

Beat the yolks of three eggs very light. Then fold in the 
whites beaten dry. Turn into an omelet pan in which one 
teaspoonful of butter has been melted. Spread the omelet evenly 
and cook over a slow fire to set the eggs. Then put in the oven 
until done. Spread one-half of the omelet with marmalade, fold 
and serve on hot platter. 



FAMILIAR TALK 

A commonsensible talk with the nominal mistress of the house 

THERE is not that household in the land where servants are 
employed which is not measurably dependent upon them for 
peace of mind as well as for comfort of body. Every housewife 
who reads this will recall the sinking of heart, the damp depres- 
sion of spirit, which has suddenly overtaken a cheerful mood 
when the kitchen barometer beckoned "storm" or "change." 
Such an overtaking is not an affliction, but it sometimes comes 
dangerously near to sorrow. The independent maid of all work 
has it in her power to alter the family plans with a word, when 
that word is "going." Should she elect to stay, her lowering 
brows and sharp or sullen speech abash a mistress who quails at 
little else. In wealthier households a domestic "strike" involves 
panic, disorder and suffering. 

I know of a wet-nurse whose abandonment of her infant 
charge, without a word of warning, at ten o'clock one Saturday 
night, caused a long and terrible illness, resulting in infantile par- 
alysis. A cook who had lived in one family for three years re- 
sented the arrival of unexpected guests, packed her trunk and left 
her mistress to get dinner. The lady was in delicate health and 
all unused to such work. She became overheated and exhausted, 
took a heavy cold, which ripened into pneumonia, and died three 
days after the cook's desertion. 

I need not multiply illustrations of the helplessness of Amer- 
ican housewives in the face of such disasters, and the possibility 
that these may befall any one of us. We have no redress. The 
women who helped organize the "Protective League" know this. 
The law does not protect the employer. Public opinion gives her 
no support. The cook whose fit of temper cost a kind mistress

250 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

her life was recommended to me within a month after an event 
that should have shocked the moral sense of every housewife in 
the community, and recommended by a friend of the murdered 
woman and of myself. When I exclaimed in surprise, I was told : 
"We can not be judges of our neighbors' domestic affairs." 

There is no class spirit among us. For some reasons this is a 
matter of congratulation to us and the public. All that is needed 
to make the opening gulf between mistresses and maids impas- 
sible is organization on our part, which signifies open war. It 
is, nevertheless, I note in passing, patent that there should be a 
code of honor among us with regard to employment of those 
who have proved absolutely untrustworthy in other households. 

We are not true to one another in this matter, and our em- 
ployees, who are held together by the unwritten laws of a union, 
none the less strong because nameless and informal, know this as 
well as we do. The knowledge is one of the most potent weapons 
in their armory. 

Let this pass for the present. I would direct your attention, 
my sister-worker in the home missionary field, to the brighter 
side of the vexed question. 

After forty years' careful study of this matter of domestic 
service study carried on in other lands as well as in our own 
I record thankfully my conviction that the domestics in well- 
regulated American homes are better cared for, better paid and 
more thoroughly appreciated than any other class of working 
women in this country or abroad. I record, likewise and con- 
fidently, that the proportion of faithful, valued and even beloved 
domestics among us is much larger than that of indifferent or 
worthless. Most cheerfully and thankfully I add to this record 
that, personally, I have a list of honest, virtuous, willing work- 
ers, whose terms of service in my family varied from three to 
thirteen years, and who went from my house to homes of their 
own, bearing with them the cordial esteem of those they had 
served. Nor is my experience singular, even in these United 
States. It is so far from being exceptional that I deprecate, al- 
most as an individual grievance, any attempt to organize those 
who should be our coworkers into a faction that considers us as 



FAMILIAR TALK 251 

"the opposition." It is a putting asunder of those whom a mu- 
tual need should join together. 

Backed by my two-score years of experiment and action, I dare 
believe that a leaf or two from my book of household happenings 
may be of service to younger women and novices in the profes- 
sion which absorbs the major part of our time and strength. 

To begin with beware of discouragement during the early 
trial-days of the new maid. Be slow to say, even to yourself: 
"She will never suit me !" The first days and weeks of a strange 
"place" are a crucial test for her as for you, and she has not your 
sense of proportion, your discipline of emotion and your philo- 
sophical spirit to help her to endure the discomforts of new ma- 
chinery. 

Looking back upon my housewifely experiences, I am moved 
to the conclusion that the domestics who stayed with me longest 
and served me best were those who did not promise great things 
in their novitiate. 

One "a greenhorn, but six weeks in the country" frankly 
owned that she knew nothing of American houses and ways. She 
was "willing to learn," and with a childish tremble of the chin 
"didn't mind how hard she worked if people were kind to her." 
I think the quivering chin and the clouding of the "Irish blue" 
eyes moved me to give her a trial. She did not know a silver 
fork from a pepper cruet, or a tea-strainer from a colander, and 
distinguished the sideboard from the buffet by calling the one the 
"big," the other the "little dresser." She had been with me a 
month when I trusted her to prepare some melons for dessert, 
giving her careful and minute directions how to halve the nutmeg 
melons, take out the seeds and fill the cavities with cracked ice, 
while the watermelon royal in proportions and the first fruits 
of our own vines was to be washed, wiped, and kept in the ice- 
chest until it was wanted. 

At dinner the "nutmegs" appeared whole ; the watermelon had 
been cut across the middle and eviscerated scraped down to the 
white lining of the rind then filled with pounded ice. The 
succulent sweetness, the rosy lusciousness of the heart, had gone 
into the garbage can. 



252 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Nevertheless, I kept blue-eyed Margaret for eight years. She 
stands out in my grateful memory as the one and only maid I 
have ever had who washed dishes "in my way." Never having 
learned any other, she mastered and maintained the proper 
method. 

The best nursery-maid I ever knew, and who blessed my house- 
hold for eleven years, objected diffidently at our first interview to 
giving a list of her qualifications for the situation. She "would 
rather a lady would find out for herself by a fair trial whether 
she would fit the place or. not." I engaged her because the 
quaint phrase took my fancy. She proved such a perfect fit that 
she continued to fill the place until she went to a snug home of 
her own. 

What may be called the New Broom of Commerce has no mis- 
givings as to her ability to fill any place, however important. 
Upon inquiry of the would-be employer as to the latter's qualifi- 
cations for that high position, the N. B. of C. may decline to ac- 
cept her offer of an office which promises more work than "privi- 
leges." But she could fill it full if she were willing to "take 
service" with the applicant. 

One of the oddest incongruities of the new-broom' problem is 
that we are always disposed to take it at its own valuation. With 
each fresh experiment we are confident that at last!-^we have 
what we have been looking for lo! these many years. She is a 
shrewd house-mother who reserves judgment until the first awk- 
ward week or the crucial first month has brought out the staying 
power or proved the lack of it. 

Officious activity in unusual directions is a bad omen in the New 
Broom of Commerce. In sporting parlance, I at once "saw the 
finish" of one whom I found upon the second day of service with 
me washing a window in the cellar. She "couldn't abide dirt no- 
where," she informed me, scrubbing vehemently at the dim panes. 
I had just passed through the kitchen where a prateful of fiery 
coals was heating the range plates to an angry glow. All the 
drafts were open ; the boiler over the sink was at a bubbling 
roar ; upon the tables was a litter of dirty plates and dishes ; pots, 
pans and kettles filled the sink. 



FAMILIAR TALK 253 

It is well to have a care of the corners, but the weightier mat- 
ters of the law of cleanliness are usually in full sight. 

I once knew a woman who, deliberately, and of purpose, 
changed servants every month. She said no new broom lasted 
more than four weeks, and when one became grubby and stumpy 
she got rid of it. Her house was the cleanest in town and her 
temper did not seem worse for friction. 

Another woman who, strange to te":, lived to be ninety years 
old, "liked moving" and never lived two years in one and the 
same house. She maintained that she kept clear of rubbish by 
frequent flittings, and enjoyed rubbing out and beginning again. 
Personally, I should have preferred a clean, lively conflagration 
every three years or so, but she throve upon nomadism. 

In minor details of housewifery, as in more important, make 
up your mind how you will manage the home and turn a deaf ear 
to gratuitous suggestions from people whose own households 
would be better conducted if their energies were concentrated. 

Let one example suffice : A so-called reformer felt herself 
called in (or out of) the Gospel of Humanity, the other day, to 
inveigh in a parlor lecture upon the unkindness and general un- 
christianliness of the maid's cap and apron which all would-be 
stylish mistresses insist upon. "Have I, a Christian woman in a 
republic," cried the oratress, "the right to put the badge of servi- 
tude upon my sister woman, because, having less money than I 
have, she is obliged to earn her living? Do I not tend to degrade, 
instead of elevating her ? 

"Of a piece with the cap and apron is the black dress, now 'the 
thing' for girls in domestic service. Why should not Bridget and 
Dinah exercise their' own right in dress as well as I?" 

These questions have been put to me many times by women who 
think and act for themselves without regard to arbitrary conven- 
tionalities. 

I am so well assured that most conventionalities have a substra- 
tum of common sense that I am slow to condemn any one of them. 

I dispute, at the outset, the insinuation that black dress, white 
cap and apron are a badge of servitude. I know no more inde- 
pendent class of women than trained nurses, no more arbitrary 



254 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

men than railway officials. I should certainly never consider the 
distinctive garb of the Sisters of Charity Protestant or Roman 
Catholic as degrading. The idea of humiliation attached to the 
uniform of housemaid and child's nurse in the mind of employees 
or employer is founded upon the conviction that domestic service 
demeans her who performs it. This is precisely the prejudice 
which sensible, philanthropic women are trying to beat down 
a prejudice that has more to do with the complications of the 
servant question than all other influences combined. If I hesi- 
tate to ask a maid entering my service to wear the uniform of her 
calling, I intimate too broadly to be misunderstood that there is 
something in that service which would demean her were it gener- 
ally known that she is in it. 

I had one maid, years ago, who would not run around the 
corner to grocery or haberdasher's without taking time to put on 
her Sunday coat and hat, and to lay off her apron. When I spoke 
to her of the absurdity and inconvenience of this, she confessed, 
blushingly, that the porter at the grocery was "keeping company 
with her," and "it" was nat'ral a gurrel should want to look her 
best when she was like to see him." 

"Ah," I said, "doesn't he know what your position is in my 
house? Has he never seen you in cap and apron?" 

"Shure, mem ! Every day when he fetches the groceries." 

"Then, if he is a sensible fellow, he will respect you all the 
more for not pretending to be what you are not. Since he knows 
what your business is, show him that you are not ashamed of it. 
You are as respectable in your place as he is in his as I am in 
mine always providing that you respect your service and your- 
self." 

Call the distinctive dress of your maid a "uniform," not a 
livery. Point out to her the examples of trained nurses, of rail- 
way conductors, of the very porters who "keep company" with 
her ; the policemen she admires afar off ; the soldiers, whose brass 
buttons dazzle her imagination. Remind her that saleswomen in 
fashionable shops wear the black gown, white apron, deep linen 
collar and cuffs and pride themselves upon looking their best in 
them. Especially make her comprehend (if you can, for the ways 



FAMILIAR TALK

of the untrained mind are past finding out), that she has an hon- 
orable calling and need not be ashamed to advertise it. 

Congratulate yourself, above all, that a sensible fashion holds 
back Bridget and Dinah from the "exercise of their own taste in 
dress." The modification of that taste wrought by the neat and 
modest costume prescribed by a majority of modern housewives 
may be in itself a good thing, sparing the eyes of spectators of her 
toilettes when she becomes "Mrs." and independent, and the purse 
of the porter, or truckman, or mechanic, who will have to pay 
for them. 

I have laid stress upon the advantages of long terms of serv- 
ice, to maid and to mistress. Like all other good things it has its 
perils and its abuses to be avoided. 

Two-thirds of the scandals that poison the social atmosphere 
steal out, like pestilential fogs, through servants' gossip. We 
discuss "the girl" in our bedchambers, and if so much stirred up 
by her works and ways as to forget what is due to our ladyhood, 
compare notes in the parlor as to these same works and ways. 
Being well-bred women, the traditions of our caste prevent us 
from making domestic grievances the staple of drawing-room 
conversation and the marrow of table-talk. The electroplated 
vulgarian never calls attention more emphatically to the absence 
of the "Sterling" stamp upon her breeding, than when she chat- 
ters habitually of the virtues and the faults of her household 
staff. 

On the other hand, the most sophisticated of us would be 
amazed and confounded if she knew what a conspicuous part 
She plays in talk below stairs and on afternoons and evenings 
"out." 

Thackeray, prince of satirists, puts it cleverly : 

"Some people ought to have 'mutes for servants in Vanity 
Fair mutes who could not write. If you are guilty tremble! 
That fellow behind your chair may be a Janissary with a bow- 
string in his plush breeches pocket. If you are not guilty, have a 
care of appearances, which are as ruinous as guilt." 

We should be neither shocked nor confounded that these things 
are so. If we are mildly surprised, it argues ignorance of human 



256 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

nature, and of the general likeness of one human creature to an- 
other, that proves the whole world kin. When mistresses in 
Parisian toilettes, clinking gold spoons against Dresden as they 
sip Bohea in boudoir or drawing-room, raise their eyebrows or 
laugh musically over the latest bit of social carrion in "our set" 
Jeames or Abigail, who has caught a whiff at a door ajar, or 
through a keyhole, is the lesser sinner in serving up the story in 
the kitchen cabinet. The domestics are in, yet not of, the em- 
ployer's world, living for six and a half days of the week among 
people with whom they have no affinity by nature or education! 
Where we would talk of "things," the lower classes discuss what 
they name "folks." Their range of thought is pitifully narrow; 
the happenings in their social life are few and tame. What won- 
der if they retail what we say and do and are, as sayings, doings 
and characters appear to them ? 

What would be extraordinary, if it were not so common, is 
the opportunity gratuitously afforded in we will say, guardedly 
one family out of three for the collection of material for these 
sensations of the nether story. I speak by the card in asserting 
that the influence gained by the confidential maid over her well- 
born, well-mannered, well-educated mistress is greater than that 
possessed by any friend in the (alleged) superior's proper circle 
of equals. 

Without taxing memory I can tell off on my fingers ten gentle- 
women, in every other sense of the word, whose intimate confi- 
dantes are hirelings who were strangers until they entered the 
employ of their respective mistresses ( ?). We need not cross the 
ocean to listen with incredulous horror to insinuations and open 
assertions as to the hold a gigantic Scotch gilly acquired over a 
royal widow. Our next-door neighbors on both sides and our 
acquaintances across the way are in like bondage. 

I have in mind one of the best and most refined women I ever 
knew whose infatuation for her incomparable Jane was the 
laughing-stock of some, the surprise and grief of others. Jane 
disputed the dear soul's will, oft and again ; gave her more advice 
than she took, and, behind her back, ridiculed her unsparingly 
as many of the mistress's friends were aware. The dupe would 



FAMILIAR TALK 257 

resign the affection and society of one and all of her compeers 
sooner than part with Jane. 

Another "just could not live without my Mary." The remote 
suggestion throws her into a paroxysm of distress. Her own 
husband knows it to be necessary to warn her not to tell this and 
that business or family secret to Mary, knowing, the while, in his 
sad soul, the chances to be against her keeping her promise not 
to share it with her factotum. 

Ellen is the bosom friend of a third ; Bridget is the right hand, 
the counsellor and colleague of a fourth. A fifth confides to her 
second-rate associates that her faithful Fanny knows as much of 
family histories (and there are histories in the clan) as she does, 
and that she the miscalled mistress takes no step of importance 
without consulting her. 

Perhaps one man in five hundred is under the thumb of his 
employee, and then because the underling has come into posses- 
sion of some dangerous secret, or has a "business hold" upon 
him. 

Have wives more need of sympathy ? or are they less nice in the 
choice of intimates, and more reckless in confidences? 



LUNCHEON CAKES 

Huckleberry shortcake 

SIFT two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking-powder and one of 
salt into a quart and a pint of flour. Chop into this two table- 
spoonfuls of cottolene or other fat and two of butter. Beat two 
eggs light and add them to a pint of sweet milk. Make a hole 
in the flour, pour in the milk and egg, and mix with a wooden 
spoon. Turn out upon a pastry board and roll into two sheets, 
about a third of an inch in thickness. Line a greased biscuit-pan 
with one sheet, cover it three-quarters of an inch thick with 
huckleberries, strew these with granulated sugar, fit the upper 
sheet of dough on the pan and bake in a steady oven until done. 
Cut into squares and send to table. Split, and eat with butter 
and sugar. 

Currant shortcake 

Mash a quart of ripe red currants and stir into them two cups 
of granulated sugar. Cover and set aside for half an hour. 

Make a dough as for quick biscuit, only using a tablespoonful 
more butter than usual. Roll into a large round biscuit about 
ten inches in diameter. Bake, and, as soon as done, split open, 
spread with butter and then with half the sweetened currants. 
Replace the top of the biscuit and pour the remainder of the cur- 
rants and juice over and around the shortcake. Serve at once. 

Hot strawberry shortcake 

Mash a quart of berries, sweeten them with plenty of granu- 
lated sugar, and let them stand for an hour and a half. 

Into a pint of flour sift a teaspoonful of baking-powder, and 

258 



LUNCHEON CAKES 259 

half a teaspoonful of salt. Chop into this one tablespoonful of 
butter until it is thoroughly incorporated. Add enough milk to 
make a dough that can be easily handled. Turn this upon a 
floured pastry-board, roll lightly into a huge biscuit as large as 
a pie-plate. Put into a greased pan and bake in a quick oven. 
When done, split open quickly, spread with butter, then thickly 
with the mashed berries, put the two halves together again, pour 
the remaining mashed berries over the entire cake, and serve 
very hot. 

Cold strawberry shortcake 

Cream two tablespoonfuls of butter with a cup of powdered 
sugar. Beat three eggs light, add to them a quarter of a cup 
of cream, and stir into the creamed butter and sugar. Beat long 
and hard before adding a cupful of flour sifted twice with a 
teaspoonful of baking-powder. Grease three jelly-cake tins, half- 
fill with the batter and bake in a quick oven. When cold, remove 
the cakes from the tins, spread each layer with halved straw- 
berries, sprinkle with sugar and pile on a dish. Serve with an 
abundance of cream. 

Scotch shortcake 

(Contributed) 

Cream a half-pound of fresti butter with a quarter-pound of 
sugar, and work into it with the hands a pound of flour. Knead 
long, then turn upon a pastry-board and press into a flat sheet 
half an inch thick. Cut into squares and bake until light-brown 
and crisp. 

Orange shortcake 

(Contributed) 

Sift into one and one-half cupfuls of flour one-half cupful of 
corn-starch, one level teaspoonful of baking-powder and one-half 
teaspoonful of salt. Rub into this with the tips of the fingers 
one-third of a cup of butter and moisten with milk enough to 
make a soft dough. Divide the dough in halves and spread, over 



26o MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the bottom of two tins. When done butter the cakes, sift over 
each powdered sugar,* and put between them thin slices of peeled 
oranges. 

German coffee cake (No. 1) 

Two cupfuls of scalded milk, one cupful of water, one yeast- 
cake (one-cent size), one cupful of sugar, one-half cupful of but- 
ter, two eggs, a little salt. 

Cream sugar and butter, add milk and yeast dissolved in the 
water, the salt and eggs, well-beaten. Thicken with enough flour 
to make a batter that can be stirred with a spoon. Beat well 
and set to rise for about three hours. When light, add enough 
flour to enable you to roll it out. Roll about an inch thick, and 
place in long, shallow pans. Set to rise. When light, drop over 
the top bits of butter about the size of a hickory-nut, and sprinkle 
generously with sugar and a little cinnamon. Bake about thirty 
minutes. 

German coffee cake (No. 2) 

To two cupfuls of soft bread sponge that has been allowed 
to rise, add one-half cupful of warm milk, a little salt, one-quarter 
cupful of melted shortening, two eggs, beaten with three-quarters 
of a cup of sugar. Add one-half grated nutmeg, some raisins 
or currants, and as much warmed flour as can be worked in with 
a spoon. Put it into a greased "tin and let it rise. When very 
light, moisten the top with milk, sprinkle with sugar and cinna- 
mon, and bake in a slow oven forty minutes. Cover with brown 
paper until almost done.

erate oven, and cover with caramel frosting. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 261 

Huckleberry cake 

Sift a scant quart of flour twice with two teaspoonfuls of 
baking-powder. Cream together one cupful of butter and two of 
sugar, add to them five beaten eggs, a cup and a half of milk, a 
half-teaspoonful, each, of powdered cinnamon and nutmeg and 
the prepared flour. Last of all, stir in a cupful of huckleberries 
thoroughly dredged with flour. Bake in greased muffin tins in 
a steady oven. 

This excellent cake is better when twenty-four hours old than 
when freshly baked. 

Apple cake 

Cream together a half-cupful of butter and two cupfuls of sugar, 
and beat into them a half-cupful of milk and five whipped eggs. 
Last of all, add three cupfuls of flour into which have been sifted 
two small teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Bake in layers. When 
cold, make the filling by heating in a double boiler a cupful of 
apple sauce, adding sugar to taste, and then beating in gradually 
the yolks of two eggs and the juice of a lemon. Cook, stirring, 
for a minute, and set aside until cold before spreading on the .cake. 

Springleys (No; 1) 
(A German recipe.) 

Beat one pound of granulated sugar for ten minutes with four 
eggs, leave for an hour, then add one tablespoonful of lemon ex- 
tract, and one teaspoonful of hartshorn. Work in enough flour 
(about two pounds) to make it stiff enough to roll out. Powder 
the forms with flour before using, so as to prevent sticking. Cut 
apart and lay on a smooth slab until morning. Sprinkle anise 
seed in the bottom of the tins before putting cakes in. Bake in a 
quick oven and watch very closely in order to keep them from 
burning. 



262 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Springerlein (No. 2) 
(An old German recipe.) 

One cup of powdered sugar, rolled fine, sifted and warmed. 
Four large eggs. Grated rind of one lemon. One pound of 
flour thoroughly dried and sifted three times. One-half teaspoon- 
ful of baking-powder sifted thoroughly with the flour. 

With a silver or wooden spoon stir the sugar and eggs steadily 
for one hour, stirring one way, add rind of lemon, flour and bak- 
ing-powder, mix quickly into a loaf-shape without much han- 
dling. Set aside in a cool place for two hours. Flour your bak- 
ing-board lightly take a small piece of dough, which by this 
time must be stiff enough to cut with a knife, roll out to about 
a quarter of an inch thick. Put about two tablespoonfuls of 
flour in a small cheese-cloth bag and with this lightly dust the 
mold. Press the dough on the mold, lightly but firmly with the 
finger tips, then turn the mold over and carefully remove. With a 
cutter cut off surplus dough, put with remainder and proceed as 
before. Use as little flour as possible in rolling out. Put a cloth 
on the table, sprinkle it with anise-seed, lay the cakes on this and 
stand them for twelve hours in a cool room. Bake in a moderate 
oven in lightly-buttered pans. This recipe will make from sixty- 
five to seventy-five cakes. 

Currant bun 

Warm a cupful of cream in a double-boiler, take it from the 
fire and stir into it a cupful of melted butter, which has not been 
allowed to cook in melting. Beat three eggs very light, add them 
to the cream and butter, then stir in a cupful of sugar. Dissolve 
a half -cake of yeast in a couple of tablespoonfuls of water, sift 
a good quart of flour, make a hollow in it, stir into it the yeast 
and then, after adding to the other mixture, a teaspoonful, each, 
of powdered mace and cinnamon, put in the flour and the yeast. 
Beat all well for a few minutes, add a cupful of currants that 
have been washed, dried and dredged with flour, pour into a 
shallow baking-pan, let it rise for several hours, until it has 



LUNCHEON CAKES 263 

doubled in size; bake one hour in a rather quick oven; sprinkle 
with fine sugar when done. 

Cinnamon buns 

Save a cupful of bread dough from the second rising. Cream a 
half-cupful of butter with a half-cupful of sugar, stir in a well- 
beaten egg and work these into the dough. Now add a half-tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a little 
hot water and a half-cupful of cleaned currants, dredged with 
flour. Knead for several minutes, form into buns, set to rise for a 
half-hour, then bake. 

Parkin 

Mix together three pounds of oatmeal, a pound and a half of 
molasses, a half-pound of butter creamed with a half-pound of 
sugar, a dash of ginger and as much baking-soda as will lie upon 
a shilling, dissolved in a little boiling water. Mix thoroughly 
and bake in flat pans. 

Grandmother's apple cake 

(From an old family recipe.) 

Three cups of dried apples stewed slowly in two cups of mo- 
lasses, then set aside to cool. Three cups of flour ; two-thirds of 
a cup of butter ; two cups of brown sugar ; one-half cup of raisins ; 
currants and grated lemon peel, mixed; eight teaspoonfuls of 
water, one level teaspoonful of soda dissolved in the water, three 
eggs, spices to taste. 

This cake will keep for weeks. It is better when a few days 
old than when first made. 

The apples should be carefully washed, first in warm, then in 
cold water, lying in this last for half an hour. Drain and toss in 
a towel before adding the molasses. 

In the "old times" the quantity of cake made by this recipe 
lasted the children a month. 



264 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Bun loaf 

(An English recipe.) 

Cream together half a cupful of mixed butter and lard with a 
half-cupful of brown sugar; beat into this one egg and work

tablespoonful of brandy, one-half teaspoonful of mace. 

Cream butter and sugar, beat whites and yolks separately and 
very light. Add the brandy and mace to the creamed butter and 
sugar, stir in the yolks, and, after beating hard for a couple of 
minutes, add the flour and whites alternately, whipping them in 
lightly, but not stirring after they have gone in. A pound cake 
batter should be as stiff as it can be stirred. Bake in brick tins, 
or in small pans in a steady oven, covering with paper to prevent 
too quick browning. 

Grafton cake

cupful of flour into which has been sifted a heaping teaspoonful 
of baking-powder. Flavor with a half-teaspoonful of nutmeg 
and cinnamon, mixed. 

Gold cake 

Cream together a cupful of butter and two cupfuls of sugar. 
When well blended, stir in the beaten yolks of four eggs and a 
scant cupful of milk. Now add, gradually, enough prepared flour 
to make a good batter, and, at the last, the juice and grated rind of 
one orange. Turn into a greased tin and bake until a straw conies 
out clean from the thickest part of the loaf. Frost with an icing 
made by beating a cupful of powdered sugar into the unbeaten 
white of one egg. When light and smooth, add a teaspoonful of 
orange juice and a tablespoonful of grated orange peel. 

Silver cake 

Cream together a cupful of sugar and a half-cupful of butter, 
and beat into them the whites of four eggs, then a half-cupful of 
cold water. Sift a pint of flour with a heaping teaspoonful of 
baking-powder and add this gradually, beating to a light batter. 
Stir in, at the last, a teaspoonful of rose-water and bake in a loaf. 
Cover with icing flavored with rose-water. 

Chocolate loaf cake (No. 1) 

Cream together a cupful of sugar and a half-cupful of butter ; 
add a cupful of milk, four beaten eggs, and three ounces of grated

vanilla. Turn into a loaf-tin and bake. Cover with chocolate 
icing. 

Cocoanut and citron layer cake 

Rub together three-quarters of a cupful of butter and a cupful 
and a half of powdered sugar. When this mixture is like a soft 
cream, add six eggs, beaten light, a cupful of water, and three 
cupfuls of flour sifted twice with a heaping teaspoonful of baking- 
powder. If the batter should be too thin, add cautiously a little 
more flour. Pour into three greased layer-cake tins, and bake to 
a delicate brown. 

Whip a pint of cream stiff with a generous half-cupful of pow- 
dered sugar. Have ready a fresh cocoanut, grated. Beat this 
into the whipped cream. When the cake is cold, spread each layer 
of it with this mixture, and sprinkle with minced citron. On the 
top layer heap the cocoanut cream, and dot it here and there with 
bits of the green citron. This cake must be eaten within a few 
hours after it is made. 



Old-fashioned sponge cake

Beat the yolks and whites of five eggs separate. Into the yolks 
stir a cupful of sugar and a small teacupful of flour that has been 
well sifted with a small teaspoonful of baking-powder. Beat long 
and hard if you do it for twenty minutes it will not be too long. 
Add a teaspoonful, each, of lemon and orange juice and fold in 
lightly the stiff whites. Bake at once in a loaf tin in a steady 
oven. It should be done in three-quarters of an hour. 



268 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Boiled sponge cake (No, 1) 

Eight eggs. The weight of the eggs in sugar, and half their 
weight in flour. Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs 
carefully. Beat the yolks very light, add the sugar to them, the 
juice and grated rind of one lemon, and half the flour. Whip 
the whites to a stiff froth, add half of these to the batter, stir in 
the rest of the flour and the remaining whites. Pour into a 
greased cake-mold, with a tight-fitting top, and put this, on the 
stove in a pot of boiling water. Do not let the water come up 
over the top of the tin. Boil steadily for at least an hour before 
looking at the cake. Test then with a straw, and if not done, boil 
a while longer. The straw should come out clean when the cake 
is done. 

Boiled sponge cake (No. 2) 

Beat six eggs light, yolks and whites separately. Bring to a 
boil three-quarters of a pound of sugar and a half-cupful of water. 
Boil for five minutes and pour gradually, beating steadily, upon 
the yolks of the eggs. Now whip in the juice of a lemon, a half- 
pound of prepared flour, and the whites of the eggs, added quickly 
and lightly. Bake in brick-shaped tins in a steady oven, covering 
the cake with paper for the first twenty minutes of the baking. 
The loaf should be done in half an hour. 

Raisin bread 

Scald a pint of milk and beat into it a teaspoonful of melted 
butter and one of salt. When the mixture is lukewarm add half 
a yeast-cake, dissolved in a half-cupful of warm water, and beat in 
enough flour to make a good batter. Set in a warm room to rise 
for eight hours. Beat hard, add a cupful of flour and work in a 
cupful of halved and seeded raisins, plentifully dredged with flour. 
Set to rise until light, then bake. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 269 

Water crackers or wafers 

(A Southern recipe.) 

Into a half-pound of flour rub a tablespoonful of butter, a little 
salt, and add enough cold water to make a dough that can be 
rolled out. Roll very thin, cut out, and roll again. Bake in a 
floured tin to a pale brown. 

Pork cake 

(A Yorkshire recipe.) 

One pound of fat salt pork free from lean or rind ; chop so fine 
as to be almost like lard, pour upon it one-half pint of boiling 
water, add two cupfuls of dark brown sugar, one of New Orleans 
molasses, one teaspoonful of soda stirred into the molasses, one 
pound of raisins, one pound of dates, chopped; one- fourth of a 
pound of citron shaved fine. Stir in enough sifted flour to make 
it the consistency of common cake batter; season with one tea- 
spoonful, each, of cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Bake 
in a moderate oven. 

Kleiner 

(A Danish recipe.) 

The yolks of six eggs, the yolks and whites of two eggs, one- 
quarter of a pound of sugar. Whip these together, add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream, one ounce of melted butter, and work in as 
much flour as possible, but not more than a pound. Knead this 
with flour until the dough stops sticking to the fingers. Roll 
out very thin with a little more flour, and cut in oblong pieces 
about three inches long, and not quite half as wide. Cut a slit 
in the middle of each, and bend one end through, so as to make 
a twist in the middle. Boil in deep cottolene or other fat until 
light brown. Put up in tin boxes. They will keep for a long 
time.

Mix together half a cupful of molasses, half a cupful of sugar, 
one egg and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. When these 
are beaten together thoroughly add one teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in half a cupful of cold water, cinnamon or ginger to taste, 
and one and a half cupfuls of flour. Bake in a shallow pan in a 
moderate oven for about thirty minutes. 

Good, in spite of the name ! 

Jelly roll 

Take four eggs and their weight in butter, sugar and flour. 
Cream the butter and sugar, add the beaten yolks, and whip for 
five minutes. Put in the flour, the stiffened whites, and, last of 
all, a full teaspoonful of baking-powder. Pour into a greased 
baking-tin, and make the layer not more than half an inch thick. 
Bake quickly and steadily, turn from the pan while hot, spread 
with jelly at once and roll. Cover with paper and tie into shape 
until cold. 

Angel cake 

Sift a teaspoonful of cream of tartar six times with a half-cup- 
ful of flour. Whip the whites of six eggs until they stand alone, 
then gradually stir into them a half-cupful of granulated sugar 
and the sifted flour. Beat very hard, turn into a clean, ungreased 
pan with a funnel in the middle. Bake in a steady oven until a 
straw comes out clean from the thickest part. Turn the pan up- 
side down upon a clean towel, and as the cake cools, it will slip out 
of the tin. When cold, ice the bottom and sides of the loaf. 

Devil's food 

Half a cupful of chocolate, grated ; half a cupful of sweet milk ; 
half a cupful of brown sugar. Boil these together until as thick as 
cream, and let cool.

two-thirds of a cupful of milk ; vanilla flavoring. Mix well, beat 



LUNCHEON CAKES 271 

in the boiled mixture and two cupfuls of flour sifted with a heap- 
ing teaspoonful of baking-powder. Bake in layers, put together 
with chocolate filling and cover with a white icing. 

Sunshine cake 

Sift one cupful of granulated sugar and add it to the yolks of 
five eggs, first beating these until they are thick. Add a dash of 
salt. Sift three-quarters of a cupful of flour twice with half a tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar, and add to the eggs and sugar. Beat 
for twenty minutes, and fold in the whites of seven eggs whipped 
stiff with a teaspoonful of white sugar dissolved in one tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice and one tablespoon ful of orange juice. 
Butter a pan, flour it lightly, and bake the cake in a steady oven 
for forty minutes. 

Orange layer cake 

Cream three tablespoonfuls of butter with two cupfuls of sugar, 
add the beaten yolks of five eggs, the juice and half the grated 
rind of an orange, and three cupfuls of flour or enough for a bat- 
ter sifted with two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Last of all, 
fold in the stiffened whites of three eggs. Bake in layer tins. 

Filling for orange cake 

Beat the whites of two eggs very stiff with one cupful of pow- 
dered sugar ; add the juice and half the grated peel of an orange. 
Whip to a soft cream, and spread between the layers when they 
are cold. 

Almond cake 

Blanch enough almonds to make a cupful of them when 
skinned, and when cold pound to a paste. Or, what is more 
convenient, buy the almond paste ready prepared. Cream a quar- 
ter-pound of butter with a pound of powdered sugar, and beat 
into this the well-whipped yolks of seven eggs. Now beat in 
gradually the almond paste, a teaspoonful of rose-water, a quart 
of sifted flour, and, lastly, the stiffened whites of the eggs. Bake 



272 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

in a loaf in a steady oven until a straw comes out clean from the 
thickest part. When cold, ice, flavoring the icing with rose-water 
and a very little essence of bitter almonds. 

Chrysanthemum cake 

Half a pint of butter and one pint of sugar rubbed to a cream ; 
the beaten whites of eight eggs, and one and a half pints of flour 
in which have been sifted one and a half teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, one-half pint of milk and the grated rind of an orange. 
Color the batter a delicate pink with cochineal, and bake in jelly- 
cake tins in a moderate oven. Use red sugar for icing. 

Daisy cake 

Beat the yolks of four eggs very light with a cupful of sugar. 
Cream- a quarter of a pound of butter and stir into the beaten egg 
and sugar, then add a gill of water into which three teaspoonfuls 
of cream have been stirred, and flavor with vanilla extract. Now 
fold in one and a half cupfuls of flour that have been sifted with 
two even teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. If this quantity makes 
the batter too stiff, add less, as some flours thicken more than oth- 
ers. Bake in layers. These form the yellow part of the cake. For 
the white part cream a half cupful of butter with one and a half 
cupfuls of sugar, add a cupful of lukewarm water and two and a 
half cupfuls of flour that have been sifted with two teaspoonfuls of 
baking-powder. Beat hard. Add the juice and rind of one lemon, 
and fold in the stiffened whites of the four eggs. Bake in layers. 
When cold, put the layers together, alternating yellow and white, 
using a boiled icing filling. Use the same icing for the top, color- 
ing it with grated orange peel. When this frosting is firm, make 
a plain white boiled icing and, with a pastry tube, make of it the 
form of a daisy on top of the other icing. 

Lemon cake 

One cupful of butter; two and a half cupfuls of sugar; three 
eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately; four cupfuls of flour; 



LUNCHEON CAKES 273

and grated rind of the lemons. Mix again, and, last of all, add the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Bake in a hot oven. 

White mountain cake 

Into three cupfuls of sugar rub one cupful of butter and stir in a 
half-cupful of sweet milk. Add four cupfuls of prepared flour al- 
ternately with the stiffened whites of ten eggs. If you find that 
the batter is going to be too stiff, do not put in the whole quantity 
of flour. Bake in layer tins. 

Filling for white mountain cake 

Boil together a half-pound of sugar and a half-cupful of water 
until the syrup is thick enough to hang in a thick thread from a 
fork dipped into it. Stir in, a teaspoonful ar a time, the stiffened 
whites of two eggs, beating them hard into the boiling syrup. 
Remove from the fire and beat until like thick cream, and cool ; 
then add a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Spread on each layer of 
the cake, put the layers in a pile on top of one another and pour 
the remaining icing over the top layer, spreading it smoothly 
with a knife dipped in boiling water. Sprinkle the whole cake 
with powdered sugar while the frosting is still moist. 

Mocha cake 

Cream a half cupful of butter with one and a half cupfuls of 
sugar. Add three-quarters of a cupful of milk, and the stiffened

One cupful of butter rubbed to a cream with two cupfuls of 
sugar ; three cupfuls of flour sifted three times with a heaping tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder; four eggs, whites and yolks beaten 
separately, and very light; one cupful of milk. Bake in two 
loaves. 

This simple formula is the foundation for scores of fancy 
cakes, especially of those baked in layers. 

Nut cake 

Cream one cupful of butter with two cupfuls of sugar ; add a 
cupful of cold water, the well-beaten yolks of four eggs, a half tea- 
spoonful of ground mace and cinnamon, mixed, and three cup- 
fuls of prepared flour, stirred in alternately with the stiffened 
whites of the eggs. Do not get the batter too stiff. Now add 
two cupfuls of hickory-nut kernels, thoroughly dredged with flour. 
Stir in quickly and turn at once into a well-greased loaf-tin. 
Bake in a steady oven, covering the cake with brown paper for 
the first half-hour it is in the oven. When a straw comes out 
clean from the thickest part it is done. When cold, turn out, and

Bake in a moderate oven about fifty minutes. 



FROSTINGS FOR CAKES 
Boiled frosting for cake 

Put into a saucepan half a cupful of water and a pound of gran- 
ulated sugar and let it boil slowly. Do not stir. When it spins 
a thread from the tip of a spoon dipped into it, take it from the 
fire. Set it aside until it is blood-warm, and then stir steadily 
until you have a smooth white cream. Apply it to the cake as you 
would any other icing. If made properly it will harden by the 
time it is fairly on the cake. If it hardens too%much before it is 
used set it in warm water until it softens. Flavor it while stirring. 

Frosting for plain loaf cake

fuls of sugar, and boil six minutes. Take from the fire and stir 
until white. Flavor and spread quickly. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 279 

Frosting made with yolks 

(Contributed) 

Proceed exactly the same as for ordinary frosting, using the 
yolks of the eggs instead of the whites. 



VARIOUS FILLINGS FOR CAKE 
Marshmallow filling 

Dissolve five teaspoonfuls of powdered gum arabic in half a 
cup of cold water, add half a cupful of powdered sugar and boil 
until thick enough to form a soft ball between the fingers when 
dropped into ice water. Pour upon the white of an egg beaten 
stiff, flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla and a few drops of 
lemon juice and spread on the cake with a knife dipped in hot 
water. 

Soft white filling for layer cake 

Make a syrup of a cupful of granulated sugar and a third of a 
cupful of water and simmer over the fire until it threads. Beat the 
whites of two eggs stiff, add a generous pinch of cream of tartar, 
and beat steadily while you pour in the hot syrup. Do not cease 
beating until it is like a thick white paste ; then flavor with vanilla 
or lemon and spread at once on the layer cakes. 

Caramel filling (No. 1) 

Put together over the fire three-quarters of a cupful of cream, 
half a cupful of sugar and a tablespoonful of butter. Cook until 
it spins a thread, add to it four tablespoonfuls of burnt sugar, or 
caramel, and a teaspoonful of vanilla. When it is cool, use for the 
filling and frosting of cake. 

Caramel filling (No. 2) 

Make the caramel of burnt sugar by putting a cupful of sugar 
over the fire with a quarter-cup of water and let them boil until 



280 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the syrup begins to change color. Tip the saucepan from one 
side to the other so that it may brown equally. When it is nearly 
black, but before it has begun to char, add to it a cupful of boiling 
water, pouring it in carefully lest in its sputtering you should be 
scorched. It must boil after this until all is dissolved and it is 
like very dark syrup. In making your cake filling put over the 
fire one tablespoonful of butter, three-quarters of a cupful of 
cream and half a cupful of white sugar. Boil all together until 
they spin a thread from the end of a fork tine, add four table- 
spoonfuls of the caramel and a teaspoonful of vanilla and set aside 
to cool. Use for filling and frosting cakes. 

Raisin filling 

One cupful of granulated sugar and one-fourth cupful of water. 
Boil together without stirring until it is brittle when dropped into 
cold water. Stir quickly into the beaten white of one egg. Add 
to this one small cup of stoned raisins chopped very fine. 

Cocoanut filling 
( Contributed) 

Chill one cupful of thick sweet cream and add one-half cupful 
of powdered sugar. Whip until light and dry and fold in the 
well-beaten white of one egg and one cupful of grated cocoanut. 
Spread between the layers and over the top of the cake. 

Custard filling 
(Contributed) 

Put two cupfuls of milk into a double boiler and bring to the 
boiling point. Moisten two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch in a 
little cold milk. Beat the yolks of four eggs very light and add 
one-half cupful of sugar ; then the corn-starch. Stir this mixture 
with the boiling milk and let it cook long enough for the corn- 
starch to be thoroughly cooked. Flavor when almost cold. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 281 

Fig filling

to the syrup and cook together until soft and smooth. When cold 
spread between the layers of the cake. 

Almond filling 
(Contributed) 

Beat three cupfuls of powdered sugar into the whites of three 
eggs. Blanch one pound of sweet almonds. Pound in a mortar 
until they make an even paste, with a little sugar. Then add to 
the whites of the eggs, and flavor with a little vanilla. Stir thor- 
oughly. 

GINGERBREADS 

Molasses gingerbread (No. 1) 

Warm together two cupfuls of molasses, a half cupful each of 
cottolene or other fat and butter, and two tablespoonf uls of ground 
ginger, and when a little more than blood-warm, beat hard for 
ten minutes; then add two teaspoonfuls of soda dissolved in a 
little hot water, a cupful of sour milk and enough flour to make a 
soft dough that can be rolled out. Turn on a floured board, roll 
out, cut into shapes and bake in a good oven. While hot brush 
over with the white of an egg. 

Molasses gingerbread (No. 2) 

One cupful of New Orleans molasses ; one cupful of sugar ; one 
cupful of sour cream ; one small cupful of butter ; three eggs ; 
three cupfuls of flour; one teaspoonful each of cloves, cinnamon, 
ginger and baking-soda, the last dissolved in a little hot water. 
Bake in two loaves in a moderate oven. 



282 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Hard gingerbread 

In a double boiler heat a cupful of New Orleans molasses, and 
add half a cupful of melted butter to it. Pour into a bowl and 
when blood-warm add a tablespoonful of ginger, a half teaspoon- 
ful of soda dissolved in a little boiling water, and stir in enough 
flour to make a stiff dough. Turn upon a floured board, roll thin, 
cut out and bake in a hot oven. 



Soft gingerbread 

Sift one teaspoonful of baking powder and a half teaspoonful 
of salt twice with two cupfuls of flour. Stir to a cream half a cup- 
ful of butter, the same of sugar and the same of molasses. Warm 
the mixture slightly and beat light before adding a well-whipped 
egg, a half teaspoonful of ground mace and a tablespoonful of 
ginger. Dissolve half a teaspoonful of baking soda in a table- 
spoonful of hot water ; stir this into half a cupful of sweet milk ; 
lastly, stir in the flour ; beat hard for one minute, and bake in two 
shallow pans, well buttered, or in pate pans.

cut into halves and well dredged with flour. 

Aunt Nelly's gingerbread 

Sift half a teaspoonful of salt and an even teaspoonful of bak- 
ing-soda in one and a half cupfuls of flour. Rub to a cream half 
a cupful of butter, with an equal quantity of brown sugar and of 
molasses. Beat smooth and light, adding, gradually, half a cupful 
of milk. Now stir in a cupful of prepared flour, after which add 
more flour until you can knead it as you would bread dough. 
Work it hard for one minute, roll into an even sheet, and cut to fit 
your baking pans, which must be well greased. Cut into squares 
with a jagging iron as the sheet lies in the pan, and bake in a 
good oven covered for twelve minutes. Then uncover and brown. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 283 

Gingerbread, "such as mother used to make" 

Mix together a half-cupful each of brown sugar and New Or- 
leans molasses, and stir in a tablespoonful of melted butter, a tea- 
spoonful of ground ginger and a teaspoonful of cinnamon. Set 
the bowl containing these ingredients at the side of the range until 
the contents are blood- warm; then remove from the range and 
beat with an egg-beater until the batter is light brown in color. 
Now stir in a cupful of sour milk and three cupfuls of sifted flour. 
Beat very hard, adding, last of all, a teaspoonful of baking-soda 
dissolved in hot water. Beat for two minutes longer and bake 
in deep muffin-tins, or in a shallow baking-pan. 

Sour milk gingerbread 

Mix together a half cupful of sugar, a half cupful of molasses, 
a tablespoonful of butter, a half teaspoonful of ground cinnamon 
and a teaspoonful of ground ginger. Set the bowl containing this

284 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

even cupfuls of flour sifted twice with a teaspoonful of baking- 
powder. 

Beat hard for one minute and bake in buttered shallow pans in 
a moderate oven forty-five minutes. Keep covered for thirty 
minutes. 



SMALL CAKES 

WHAT the old-fashioned people call "dough cakes" what we 
term "cookies" or "jumbles" are amongst the most popular small 
cakes that the housemother can present to her brood. The only 
trouble is that they are sometimes too popular, as they melt away 
before John's and the boys' onslaughts like snow under spring 
sunshine. Still the mother makes them gladly. It is always a 
great convenience to have a stone crock full of cookies in the 
house. They are nice for luncheon, for afternoon tea, and to eat 
with a glass of milk before going to bed. They must be kept 
in a dry atmosphere, as they are doubly delicious when crisp and 
friable. 

Almond macaroons 

Beat the whites of three eggs stiff and whip into them half a 
cupful of powdered sugar, a quarter-pound of almond paste, crum- 
bled fine, half a teaspoonful of corn-starch, and five drops of es- 
sence of bitter almonds. Drop by the spoonful on buttered pa- 
per and bake in a hot oven. If you can not get almond paste, 
pound blanched almonds fine. 

Cocoanut macaroons 

Into two cups of grated cocoanut stir a cupful and a half of 
powdered sugar and a gill of cream, or just enough to wet the 
cocoanut. Add the beaten whites of two eggs, and mix all thor- 
oughly. Line a baking pan with buttered paper, drop the cocoa- 
nut mixture by the teaspoonful upon this and bake quickly in a 
hot oven. Sift powdered sugar over the macaroons while they are 
still warm. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 285 

Auntie's cookies 

One cupful of butter ; two cupfuls of sugar ; three eggs ; one- 
half teaspoonful of baking-powder; one even teaspoonful of nut- 
meg and half as much cloves ; flour for a soft dough. Begin with 
two cupfuls, adding cautiously until you have the right consist- 
ency. 

Rub butter and sugar to a soft cream ; add the yolks of the eggs, 
beaten light, then the spice, one cupful of flour with which the 
baking-powder has been sifted twice, and half the whites beaten 
stiff. Next another cupful of flour and the rest of the whites. 
Roll into a sheet of dough about a quarter-inch thick, cut into 
rounds and bake in a good oven. If you like, you may stick a 
seeded raisin or a bit of citron in the top of each cooky before 
baking. 

Currant cookies 

One cupful of sugar; two scant cupfuls of flour; four table- 
spoonfuls of butter ; two eggs ; one scant teaspoonful of baking- 
powder; one cupful of cleaned currants, chopped fine; nutmeg 
and cinnamon to taste. 

Rub butter and sugar to a cream; add spices and the eggs 
beaten light, then the flour with which the baking-powder has 
been sifted twice; lastly, the chopped currants. Roll out with 
quick, light strokes, cut into shapes and bake in a tolerably brisk 
oven. They are better the second day after baking than on the 
first. 

Oatmeal cookies 

Mix together four cupfuls of flour (into which you have sifted 
a teaspoonful of soda) and three cupfuls of oatmeal ; add two cup- 
fuls of powdered sugar, a cupful of melted butter, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Moisten the mass with enough cold water to 
make a very stiff dough. Roll as thin as possible, cut into round 
cakes and bake. This will make a very large number of cookies, 
but they will keep well for weeks. 



286 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

German almond cookies 

The yolks of six eggs ; one and a half cupfuls of sugar ; three- 
quarters of a cupful of butter ; one cupful of almonds, chopped :

flour to enable you to roll it very thin. Cut into, rounds and bake 
quickly.

Fanny's cookies 

Into two cupfuls of granulated sugar rub one cupful of butter, 
then stir in three eggs, well beaten, and flour enough to make a 
stiff dough. Roll out on a floured board, cut, sprinkle with gran- 
ulated sugar, stick a raisin in the center of each and bake. 

Sand cookies 

Cream a cupful of butter with two cupfuls of granulated sugar, 
add two eggs beaten light, yolks and whites separately, then half a 
teaspoonful of ground mace or of nutmeg. Have ready three 
cupfuls of flour sifted twice with one teaspoonful of baking-pow- 
der, and work into the mixture until you can roll out the dough. 

Cut round with a tin cutter; wash the tops lightly with white 
of egg; press half of a split blanched almond into the center of 
each, and sprinkle well with coarse granulated sugar. 

This is the "sand." 

Bake quickly. 

Peanut cookies 

One cupful of butter; one and one-half cupfuls of powdered 
sugar ; three eggs ; one cupful of freshly roasted peanuts, pounded, 
rolled to a coarse powder, and mixed with about three cupfuls of 
flour. 

Cream the butter and sugar, add the beaten eggs, then the flour 
and crushed peanuts. The dough should be just stiff enough to 
handle easily. Drop the dough by the spoonful upon a floured 
board, pat it into round cakes with the fingers, grate a little nut- 
meg over the top of each cake and bake. A novelty, and one that 
is likely to be popular. 

Alma's drop cakes 

Beat five eggs light yolks and whites separately. Into the 
yolks stir a cupful of powdered sugar, the juice of a lemon and 
half the grated peel then the stiffened whites of the eggs. Sift 
together a heaping cupful of flour and a teaspoonful of baking- 



288 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

powder, and beat this into the other ingredients. Line a hot but- 
tered pan with thick writing paper, w T ell buttered ; drop the batter 
by the spoonful upon the paper, and bake at once in a quick oven. 
Sift powdered sugar over them while hot. 

Vanilla cookies 

Cream one cupful of butter with two of sugar, and stir in a cup- 
ful of sour cream, two beaten eggs and three cupfuls of flour 
sifted twice with a teaspoonful of soda. Flavor with vanilla ex- 
tract. If your dough is not stiff enough to handle, add more 
sifted flour until it is of the right consistency. Roll into a sheet 
about a quarter of an inch thick, cut into rounds and bake. 

Cocoamit cream puffs 

These cakes, while requiring care in their preparation, amply 
repay one for the time spent in their making. 

Into a cupful of hot water stir a half-cupful of butter and bring 
to a boil. Then add a cupful and a half of flour, and cook (stir- 
ring constantly) for two minutes ; take from the fire and pour into 
a bowl to cool. When the mixture is cold beat into it the whipped 
yolks of four eggs ; lastly, the stiffened whites. Line a baking pan 
with buttered paper ; drop the batter by the large spoonful upon it, 
and bake in a quick oven. The puffs should be done in fifteen 
minutes. When they are cold cut off the tops, fill with the fol- 
lowing mixture and replace the tops. 

Filling 

Into two cupfuls of thick whipped cream beat a cupful of grated 
cocoanut, half a cupful of powdered sugar and a teaspoonful of 
extract of bitter almonds. Whip up hard before putting into the 
puff shells. 

Molasses cookies 

Warm a cupful of molasses slightly and beat to a cream with 
half a cupful of softened butter. Add the juice of half a lemon, 
one tablespoonful of ginger and half a teaspoonful of cinnamon. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 289 

Now stir in two cnpfuls of flour sifted three times with an even 
teaspoonful of baking-soda, until you have a soft dough. Roll out 
and cut into shapes. Bake in a good oven. 

Ginger jumbles 

Into two cupfuls of molasses stir a cupful of melted butter, a 
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, a tablespoonful of pulverized 
ginger, and a half a teaspoonful of baking-soda. Beat well, add 
enough flour to make a soft dough, form with floured hands into 
small cakes and bake. 

Gingersnaps (No. 1) 

One cupful of sugar, one cupful of butter, one tablespoonful of 
ginger, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little water, as much 
flour as can be stirred in with a spoon not kneaded. Pinch off 
a bit of the dough the size of a large marble, roll in the hands 
until round, pat it flat and place in a pan, leaving between each 
cake space for spreading; bake in a good oven to a moderate 
brown. Leave in the pan until sufficiently cool to be "snappy." 

Gingersnaps (No. 2) 

Cream a cupful of butter with one of sugar, beat in a cupful of 
molasses, stir in a cupful of water, a teaspoonful each of ground 
ginger and cinnamon, a teaspoonful of allspice and a scant one of 
soda sifted with a pint and a half of flour. Add enough flour to 
make a dough that can be rolled out, roll thin, cut into rounds, 
and bake. 

Pfeffernusse 
(A German recipe.) 

One pound of fine flour, sifted; one teaspoonful of baking- 
powder ; one pound of sugar, sifted ; four large eggs ; three 
ounces of citron ; the grated rind of 6ne lemon ; one grated nut- 
meg; one teaspoonful of cinnamon; one scant teaspoonful of 
19 



290 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ground cloves. Mix the baking-powder and spices and sift with 
the flour, then work in the beaten eggs and sugar ; form into small 
balls and bake in a slow oven. Place in a pan sufficiently far apart 
to allow them to swell to the size of macaroons when baked. 

White peppernuts 

Cream one and a half cupfuls of granulated sugar and a half- 
cupful of butter together, add three eggs, beaten light, a half cup- 
ful of milk, two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract, and flour sifted 
with two even teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Add this flour 
until stiff enough to roll out ; roll a half inch thick, cut out with a 
thimble and bake in a hot oven. Care should be taken to put them 
so far apart that they will not run together in the baking. 

9 

Brown peppernuts 

Three eggs ; one cupful of brown sugar ; a half-cupful of but- 
ter ; one cupful of molasses ; a half-cupful of sour or buttermilk ; 
a teaspoonful of baking-soda ; a scant teaspoonful of cinnamon 
and ginger, and flour enough to handle. Mix, roll out and bake 
as you would white peppernuts. 

Peppernuts (No. 4) 

Mix together half a pound of powdered sugar, the yolks of 
two eggs, one whole egg and a quarter-teaspoonf ul of potash pro- 
cured from a druggist. Stir thk well for fifteen minutes ; add a 
quarter-ounce of ground cinnamon, a quarter-teaspoonful each of 
ground pepper and cloves, and the grated rind of a lemon. When 
all is well mixed, put with it half a pound of pastry flour. Knead 
well on a floured board, roll out about half an inch thick and cut 
into small rounds with a biscuit cutter. Bake in a greased tin 
in a very moderate oven. 

Peppernuts (No. 5) 

Sift together two cupfuls of sugar, four cupfuls of flour, one 
tablespoonful of cinnamon, half a tablespoonful of cloves, and one 



LUNCHEON CAKES 291 

and a half teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Add to this half a cup- 
ful of citron, chopped fine ; the grated rind of a lemon and a quar- 
ter of a nutmeg. Make to a dough with four eggs beaten enough 
to mix yolks and whites. Shape into balls the size of a hickory- 
nut, with buttered hands, and bake in pans lined with greased pa- 
per. When done, cover with an icing. 

Icing for peppernuts 

Into two tablespoonfuls of boiling water stir enough confec- 
tioner's sugar to make it thick. Flavor with lemon juice and a 
little of the grated rind. The icing should be of the right con- 
sistency to be applied with a pastry brush. Let the cakes stand 
in a cool, dry place until the icing has hardened. 

Vanities (No. 1) 

Beat two eggs ; stir in a pinch of salt and a half-teaspoonful of 
rose water ; add sifted flour until just stiff enough to roll out. Cut 
with a cake-cutter and fry quickly in hot cottolene or other fat. 
Sift powdered sugar on them while hot, and when cool put a tea- 
spoonful of jelly in the center of each. 

Vanities (No. 2) 

Boil a cupful of milk and thicken it in the saucepan with flour 
to a stiff dough. Let it become cool, then break in three eggs, 
one at a time, and beat thoroughly. Add a tablespoonf ul of melted 
butter. Drop it by small teaspoonfuls into hot cottolene or some 
good fat, fry to a delicate brown ; drain and roll in a mixture of 
sugar and cinnamon. 

Anise cakes 

Cream a half-pound of butter with a half-pound of sugar, add 
three well-beaten eggs and enough flour to make a stiff dough, 
adding to the flour an ounce of anise seed. Roll into a thin sheet, 
cut into shapes with a cutter and bake. 



292 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Hermits 

Cream together a cupful of butter and two of sugar. Beat in 
the whipped yolks of three eggs, add a half-cupful of milk and 
then the beaten whites. Work in two cupfuls of flour, sifted twice 
with a teaspoonful of baking-powder, and if this does not make 
a dough that could be rolled out, add more flour cautiously, not 
to have the cakes too stiff. Roll into a very thin sheet, strew 
thickly with the kernels of hickory-nuts, pecans or English wal- 
nuts, chopped fine and sprinkled with sugar. Fold the dough 
once over the nuts, passing the rolling-pin lightly over the upper 
sheet, and cut into rounds with a cake cutter. Bake in a quick 
oven, covered, for fifteen minutes ; uncover and brown. 

Plain cookies 

(Contributed) 

Cream together one cupful of butter and two cupfuls of sugar. 
Add one egg, well beaten, one cupful of milk, three teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder and flour enough to make a soft dough. Roll 
thin, cut in small cakes and bake in a moderate oven. 

Eggless cookies 

(Contributed) 

Cream one cupful of butter and add one cupful of sweet milk, 
one teaspoonful of vanilla, and one teaspoonful of soda dissolved 
in a little warm water. Use flour enough to make a soft dough. 
Cakes made by this recipe will keep fresh for a long time. 



THE DOUGHNUT AND CBULLER FAMILY 

THESE crisp and toothsome dainties may be made several weeks 
before they are needed, as they improve with age. Keep them 
in a stone crock, or large tin cracker-box with a closely-fitting 



LUNCHEON CAKES 293 

cover. As you pack them down, sprinkle each layer with powdered 
sugar. 

Have a large quantity cut out before you begin the work of 
frying, for when the fat has attained the proper state of heat you 
will not want to set it to one side to cool, while you roll out another 
batch of the small cakes. Of course, crullers and doughnuts do 
not really taste better when cut into various shapes, but, since 
John and the boys fancy that they do, the mother will do well 
to indulge the innocent notion and to twist and turn the raw 
dough into fantastic and attractive forms. 

Heat the cottolene or other fat used for frying gradually until 
so hot that a piece of the dough used as a test will rise to the sur- 
face at once, swell immediately and brown quickly. As the dough- 
nuts brown, remove them from the kettle with a perforated 
spoon and lay in a colander, set at the side of the stove, to drain 
free of grease. Transfer to a platter, and while hot, sprinkle with 
sugar. 

Quick doughnuts 

Cream one cupful of sugar with half a cupful of butter, add one 
cupful of milk, two eggs, beaten light, one tablespoonful of cinna- 
mon and nutmeg mixed, and two cupfuls of flour into which has 
been sifted a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder. Work in 
enough flour to make a soft dough. Roll out into a sheet nearly 
an inch thick, and cut into shapes with a cutter. Fry in deep 
cottolene or other fat. 

Sour milk doughnuts 

Cream a cupful of butter and two cupfuls of sugar; add four 
beaten eggs, a half-pint of sour milk, a teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in a little boiling water, a teaspoonful each of nutmeg and 
cinnamon, and enough flour to make a dough that can be rolled 
out. Roll and cut into shapes. Fry in deep, boiling cottolene or 
other fat, which has been heated slowly. 

Mother's doughnuts 

Cream a generous half cupful of butter with two cupfuls of su-. 
gar ; add three well-beaten eggs, a cupful and a half of milk, and 



294 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

about five cupfuls of flour, which has been sifted with three tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder. Add this flour gradually until you 
have enough to make a dough that can be rolled out, as it may not 
take the full amount. Roll out, cut into rounds, drop into boiling 
cottolene or other fat and fry to a golden brown. Drain in a col- 
ander, and while hot sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Ideal crullers 

Rub together a half-pound of butter and three-quarters of a 
pound of powdered sugar. When you have a soft cream, work 
in gradually six beaten eggs, a half-teaspoonful each of nutmeg 
and cinnamon, and by the handful enough flour to enable you 
to roll out the dough. Avoid getting it too stiff. Roll into a very 
thin sheet and cut into rings. The centers of the rings make 
prettly little marble-shaped crullers. Fry in deep boiling cotto- 
lene or other fat, which has been heated slowly. 

Mary's crullers 

Rub half a pound of butter to a cream with three-quarters of a 
pound of pulverized sugar. Beat in the yolks of five eggs, whipped 
smooth; add an even teaspoonful of mace and cinnamon mixed, 
lastly the stiffened whites of the eggs, alternately with enough 
flour for a stiff dough. Begin with two cupfuls (sifted). Roll 
out, cut into fancy shapes and set in a cold place for an hour be- 
fore frying in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. 

Buttermilk crullers 

Into a cupful and a half of granulated sugar rub three-quarters 
of a cupful of butter, add two eggs, half a teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in a tablespoonful of hot water, and a cupful and a half of 
buttermilk. Now sift in enough flour to make a tender dough, 
roll out and fry. 



LUNCHEON CAKES 295 

Sunnybank crullers 

Rub together four tablespoonfuls of butter and a generous cup- 
ful of powdered sugar ; add to the cream thus made half a tea- 
spoonful of powdered cinnamon and beat it in thoroughly. Now 
add four well-beaten eggs, and whip long and hard. Last of all, 
sift in very gradually enough flour to make a stiff dough. Roll 
this out and, with a fancy cake-cutter, cut it into small orna- 
mental shapes. The bits of dough left over may be gathered up, 
put together and rolled out again, then cut into strips and small 
squares. After the crullers are cooked and drained free of fat, 
spread them upon a platter and sprinkle with powdered sugar and 
cinnamon in the proportion of a teaspoonful of the spice to half a 
cupful of sugar. 



FAMILIAR TALK 
A FRIENDLY WORD WITH "OTTR MAID" 

To BEGIN with I wish I could devise some method of convinc- 
ing you that I am really and truly "friendly." 

A newspaper article I have just read says, "It can not be denied 
that the present attitude of American mistress and maid is, at 
best, one of armed neutrality." 

Put into everyday English, that means that each is willing, if 
convenient, to get along comfortably and pleasantly with the 
other, but that each holds herself ready to fight, if fighting seems 
to be advisable. 

This, "attitude" is all wrong, through and through. I should 
like to change it in your mind before I begin to talk with you. 

The best and most wonderful Book ever written tells us that 
the men who, once upon a time, built the ruined walls and temple 
of Jerusalem, held a trowel, or spade, or hammer in one hand, 
and a sword or spear in the other, because their enemies were ly- 
ing in wait, watching for an opportunity to attack them. We are 
not surprised to read in the same chapter that these enemies 
laughed at the sort of work done under such circumstances. They 
said, "If a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall." 
Two hands are better for doing work than one; two heads are 
better for planning work than one; two hearts at peace with 
each other are the greatest possible help to head and hands. 

Take it for granted when you take a place that your employer 
is friendly to you. Don't look upon her as a possible enemy. When 
she trusts you to handle delicate china, take care of handsome fur- 
niture or to cook materials for the meals she and her family are to 
eat, she shows that she has confidence in your ability and your 

296 



FAMILIAR TALK 297 

honesty. When she entrusts her little children to your care, she 
proves this yet more plainly. After inquiring into your character 
and manner of work, she is so far satisfied that you are just what 
she wants that she has received you into her house and, in one 
sense, into her family. She trusts you, then. Trust her, until she 
gives you very plain proof that she does not deserve your trust. 

For the first month, at least, make up your mind to look on 
the bright side of everything, instead of asking yourself every 
hour, "I wonder if I can stay?" Triat same "wondering" un- 
settles more maids and prejudices more mistresses' minds against 
well-meaning domestics than any other one thing. Make allow- 
ances for your employer's awkward ways of giving orders; for 
her little "tempers," that may be awkwardness, too, and a sort of. 
bashfulness you do not understand, but which is not uncommon. 
More than one well-educated, refined woman has confessed to 
me that she was "awfully afraid of every new maid." Some of 
us have reason to be. Bear in mind, if your new "lady" seems 
stiff, and, maybe, distrustful of you, that she may have had ugly 
experiences with some maid who went before you, one of the 
maids "who spoil places for other girls." 

I wish you could make a resolution and keep it not to dis- 
cuss the mistresses you have had, and especially the mistress you 
have now, with other maids, in and out of the house which is 
your present home. I am sorry to be obliged to say that the 
practice of talking of the hardships of her place is our maid's most 
common and incorrigible habit. So common is it that I have won- 
dered sometimes if it were not considered a part of the duty she 
owes to herself and her companions who are making their living 
in the same way as herself. If you could once determine that your 
employer is your friend, that her interests are yours, and that you 
will make your "place" into a real home, where you may spend 
years, perhaps the rest of your life you would not be tempted to 
magnify the work you have to do, the things you have to put 
up with the thousand and one complaints that form so large a 
part of the talk "downstairs." If you are so unfortunate as to 
take service with a bad-tempered, bad-mannered, bad-hearted 
woman, whose only reason for thinking herself better than you is 



298 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

that she has more money, quietly leave when your month is up. 
That is the only dignified thing to do. Don't spoil your temper by 
fighting her, and waste your breath and time by gossiping about 
her to your acquaintances. 

If, on the other hand, you have an employer who honestly tries 
to treat you well ; who likes you and praises your work, pays your 
wages regularly, is kind to you in sickness, pleasant in speech 
and willing to grant you every reasonable indulgence don't be 
afraid to say that she is all this, and that you are comfortable and 
contented in your present position. I know many such mistresses. 
I wish I could add that they often have justice done them 
behind their backs by maids to whom they (the mistresses) are 
so attached that they will not allow their dearest friends to find 
fault with them. 

It is perfectly natural that you should side with those of your 
own class and business when a question of ill-usage comes up. If 
you know of a maid whose wages are not paid, who is scolded 
unjustly, badly fed and made to work beyond her strength, you 
are right to sympathize with her. It would also be right to de- 
spise her if she did not throw up her place and look for a better. 
It is still more just to despise one who has none of these things 
to complain of, and has no intention of making a change, yet 
speaks of her employer as a cruel mistress, and does all she can to 
cast discredit upon the family. As a sensible girl you ought to 
know that, in this country, nobody need keep such a place as she 
makes out hers to be and no self-respecting person would keep it. 

Try, then, to make the best of your place, and the best of your- 
self while you are in it. Earn your wages fairly and honestly. 
There is no better business for a woman in America than domes- 
tic service, if you and others like you would combine to keep 
places so long as to make yourselves a part of the household, and 
so nearly indispensable that not a member of the family could do 
without you. Frequent changing is an expensive matter. It is the 
maid who holds one position for years who is well-dressed, re- 
spected and beloved by her employers, and who rolls up a snug 
account in the savings-bank against marriage or a rainy day. 

(Sometimes they mean the same thing!) 



FAMILIAR TALK 299 

Never lose sight of the truth that you are as respectable in your 
position as the president's wife in hers, while you perform the 
duties of that position soberly, honestly and in the fear of God 
so much more respectable in your safe, honorable home shelter 
than the flashy, fast shop-girl and unhealthy, underfed and over- 
dressed factory girl in hers, that we, who are sincerely interested 
in you, can not but wonder that every clear-headed, modest girl 
does not see this. 

As a last word : Don't keep overstrict account of "work you 
were not engaged to do." I know of no business in the world 
in which a faithful, conscientious worker does not do much for 
which he is not paid at least, not paid in money. Dozens of un- 
foreseen tasks, big and little, are coming up, all the time, in every 
trade and profession, and for everybody from the president down 
to a peanut peddler. The blessed Book we spoke of just now com- 
mands us to do whatever is laid to our hand, "as unto the Lord, 
and not unto men." One and all, we should find delight in these 
extra labors if we could, in our hearts, determine to do them "as 
unto the dear Lord," whose mercies to .us are past counting. Do 
what you are "engaged" to do, as unto the employer whose wages 
you receive, and offer the "extras" as a free-will offering to your 
Heavenly Father. 

"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." 

Read and obey the text in this spirit, and that "so" becomes the 
most important word in this, or in any language. 



DINNER 

THIS, the most important meal of the day, is attended with a 
certain degree of ceremony in the most modest household. Break- 
fast may be hurried over in haste that is not unseemly when one 
considers that the day's work is all ahead of the family, and 
luncheon may dwindle down to a "cold bite" eaten standing. Ev- 
erybody must dine, and dining is always "business." A dinner 
party is the most serious of social functions, and even a family 
dinner follows a prescribed order. There must be a beginning, a 
middle and an end. Plates must be changed, for even in the back- 
woods, meat and pudding are not set on the table at the same time. 

This is as it should be. If we would have 

"Good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both" 
we must bring to the discussion of the heavier nourishment set 
before us orderliness, leisure and tempers free from annoying 
discomforts. Magnificence is within the reach of a few ; modest 
elegance is attainable by many ; cleanliness and good manners are 
free to the humblest housemother and her brood. 

So much for a general view 'of the wide field indicated by the 
word set at the head of this chapter. Before entering upon a dis- 
cussion of the dishes which belong to this section of our book, I 
would lay stress upon a cardinal duty connected with dinner- 
eating a duty the neglect of which is a proverbial national dis- 
grace. 

It is a physical impossibility to eat properly and to digest with 
any prospect of healthful assimilation a breakfast of coffee, 
steak, hot rolls and fried potatoes, in five minutes, or in fifteen. 
Yet this is what the commuter, the clerk, the collegian and a 
host of other men (including an occasional capitalist) try to do 
six days in the week. They eat, as they live, on the jump. When

an especially audacious jump lands them in the grave, intelligent 
scientists affect to wonder with the rest of mankind at the un- 
timely taking-off. 

Big mouthfuls and bolting are alike part of the national trick 
advertised in dead earnest, not satirized, by the raucous shout of 
the brakeman at the half-way house "Five minutes for refresh- 
ments!" 

Mr. Gladstone did not consider it undignified to give, as one 
secret of the sanity of body and mind prolonged through four- 
score years, his habit of chewing twenty times upon every morsel 
of meat taken into his mouth. The family physician who at- 
tended one of our great men lately deceased in his awfully 
brief final illness, said frankly that certain sharp attacks that had 
afflicted the statesman for several months before the cruel climax 
came, were caused by the habit of eating hurriedly such luncheons 
as he could snatch in the intervals of business. If the truth were 
told as bravely in thousands of other "mysterious visitations," 
business men would be startled and enlightened if not cured of 
like practices. 

Dinner the evening dinner in particular gives the driven 
man a chance for his life. He sins against light and opportunity 
when he carries the bolting habit to the third meal. It may be 
vulgar to talk of chewing. Our very babies are taught to say 
''masticate," instead. It is more vulgar not to do the thing itself. 

The cool indifference with which we admit the humiliating truth 
that our national digestion is chronically out of order, is more 
culpable even than the shiftless amiability with which we condone 
municipal and corporation murders. The individual citizen may 
well draw back from the task of fighting boards and millions. 
His digestive apparatus is his own, subject to no lien or disability 
except such as sloth and carelessness put upon it. 

If there be a self-evident fact in everyday hygiene it is that 
food swallowed without chewing, clogs and irritates the stomach. 
No other health law is so shamelessly and constantly transgressed 
by the human animal whose habitat is the United States of Amer- 
ica. The most stupid lout of a hostler knows that a horse must 
have time for chewing his oats, or he will go hungry ; the scullion 



302 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

will tell you that, while chickens bolt whole corn and gobble down 
worms, the gizzard stands sentinel over the stomach, doing thor- 
oughly the part of grinders and incisors. The cow sets us the best 
example of all our sensible dumb teachers. The wondrous-wise 
air with which she munches cud by the hour is a proverb among 
sages. The so-called nobler part of creation is not ashamed to 
seek in the pepsin, which is a memorial to her wisdom, a remedy 
for the ills brought upon himself by obstinate disregard of the 
duty her example enforces. 

It is not a nice thing to talk or write of, as I have admitted. And 
this is not because the act of mastication is unseemly. The meas- 
ured movement of the jaws in the decorous disposition of whatever 
is committed to them is no more grotesque than the "winking as 
usual," enjoined by the photographer. This is emphatically true 
when food is cut small before it is eaten. 

The stomach is long-suffering and kind, but not omnipotent. 
The salivary glands are her natural and most efficient allies. The 
"bolter" cuts off supplies from this source. The chunks of solid 
matter, washed down with scalding liquid or iced water, are more 
than the other gastric juices can manage. The result is as sure 
as the addition of two and two, followed by the subtraction of 
four. 

A judicious mother who has made physiology a study for her 
children's sake,, teaches her little ones to chew the well-cooked 
cereals that form the staple of their breakfast. Furthermore, she 
teaches that it is indecent to swallow anything except liquids with- 
out chewing it. The rule is not arbitrary. Each child compre- 
hends the office of the saliva, that the motion of chewing excites it, 
and that to take crude lumps of anything into the stomach is ab- 
solutely wrong. 

In the chance that other mothers may imitate her example lies 
the only hope of the American stomach. The adult bolter is 
joined to his evil practice. He is feeding with egg-coal an engine 
that was built to be run with pea coal, adding to the mischief done 
the delicate machinery the outrage of chunking in and packing 
down the fuel. 



SOUPS 



It is a progressive age and the average American house- 
wife is slowly coming to some appreciation of the nutritive value 
of soups as an article of daily food. As a rule of wide application, 
she does not yet credit how easy it is to prepare them. Some one 
says that the motto for the would-be soup-maker should be, 
"strong stock and no grease." What might be a good soup is un- 
palatable if globules of grease float on the surface, and it takes 
a hungry man, without a fastidious taste, to enjoy it under these 
circumstances. See to it then that all meat-stocks are perfectly 
skimmed when very cold, that every vestige of fat may be re- 
moved. 

A good soup stock 

Four pounds of beef marrow bones, well cracked ; one pound 
of coarse lean beef chopped as for beef-tea, and the same of lean 
veal ; one large onion, one carrot, one turnip, six refuse stalks of 
celery, a cabbage leaf; seven quarts of cold water; prepare and 
salt to taste. 

Put the meat and vegetables, the latter cut up small, into a 
large pot, cover with the water and set at the side of the range 
where it will not reach the scalding point under an hour. Keep 
closely covered and let it simmer, always scalding hot, never boil- 
ing hard, for six hours. Remove from the fire, season and set in a 
cool place until next day. Remove the fat, strain out bones and 
vegetables, pressing hard to extract all the nourishment and set 
away in the refrigerator until needed. 

At least one dozen varieties of soups and broths can be founded 
upon this stock.

White stock 

Put over the fire two pounds of the cheaper part of veal, cut 
into small pieces, or a well-cracked knuckle of veal, with three 
quarts of cold water, a sliced onion, a bay-leaf and a couple of 
stalks of celery cut into pieces. Let it come to a boil slowly, and 
simmer for five or six hours. Season with salt and pepper and set 
aside to get cold. Remove the fat, take out the bones and you will 
have a thick jelly. This can be heated, skimmed and, if desired, 
strained before it is used. It will be a strong and nutritious stock. 

"Left-over" stock 

Have a crock in your refrigerator expressly for this. Collect 
for it the bones of cooked meats from which the meat has been 
carved ; the carcasses of poultry, bits of gristly roasts and steaks, 
cold vegetables, even a baked apple now and then. Twice a week, 
put all-, cracking the bones well, into the stock-pot; cover deep 
with cold water and cook slowly until the liquid is reduced to half 
the original quantity. Season to taste, and strain, rubbing all 
through the colander that will pass. 

By addition of barley, rice, tomatoes or, in fact, almost any 
vegetable or cereal, you may make excellent broths from this 
compound of "unconsidered trifles." 

Mock turtle soup 

Boil a calf's head until the meat leaves the bones. Leave it in 
the seasoned soup until next day, then take it out, scrape off the 
fat and remove the bones. Put the jellied stock over the fire 
with the bones, the ears, chopped, one grated carrot, one sliced 
onion, a bunch of soup herbs, a teaspoonful of allspice, a salt- 
spoonful of paprika and salt to taste. Boil for one hour. Take 
from the fire, strain, thicken with two tablespoon fuls of butter 
rolled in as much browned flour, add two teaspoonfuls of kitchen 
bouquet, and, when the soup is thickened, drop in the tongue and 
parts of the cheek cut into dice. Add a ^ill of sherry and the iuice 
of a lemon and pour upon forcemeat balls in a hot tureen. Make 



SOUPS 305 

the forcemeat balls by rubbing the brains to a paste with the yolk 
of a hard-boiled egg, a little browned flour and the yolk of a raw 
egg. Roll them in brown flour and let them stand in a quick oven 
until lightly crusted over. 

Veal and tapioca soup 

Crack a knuckle of veal into six pieces and put over the fire 
with a cracked ham bone, if you have it. If not, use a half-pound 
of lean salt pork, chopped, or the soaked rind of salt pork or 
corned ham. Add a few stalks of celery, chopped. Cover with 
cold water, adding a quart for every pound of meat and bones. 
Cover, and bring slowly to the boil. Simmer then for five hours, 
or until the liquor is reduced to one-half the original quantity. 
Season with pepper, salt and onion juice and set away until next 
day, when remove the fat. 

You have now a thick jelly. Set over the fire to melt. When 
you can pour it easily, strain out the bones and scraps of meat. 
Put half a cupful of tapioca to soak in a cupful of cold water for 
two hours. Measure a quart of your veal stock and put over the 
fire to heat. When the boil is reached, add the taoioca, a ?cant 
tablespoonful of kitchen bouquet, with a tablespoonful of finely 
minced parsley and cook fifteen minutes longer, boiling briskly. 

Veal and sa^o broth 

Make stock as directed in last recipe, adding, when it has been 
skimmed and strained, half a cupful of pearl sago, previously 
soaked for three hours in warm water. Simmer for half an hour. 
Have ready in a saucepan a cupful of hot milk, into which a bit of 
soda has been dropped ; stir into it a tablespoonful of butter rolled 
in half as much flour, and when it has thickened, turn into the 
sago broth two minutes before removing it from the fire. 

Veal and rice broth 

To a quart of your veal stock add half a cupful of washed and 
soaked rice; cook for twenty minutes, fast, and mix with hot 
20 



3o6 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

milk, thickened as directed in last recipe. Cook three minutes and 
serve. 

Ox-tail soup 

Cut a cleaned ox-tail at each joint and fry five minutes in butter 
or good dripping. Take out the meat and put into a warmed soup- 
kettle while you fry a sliced onion in the dripping left in the fry- 
ing-pan. Turn this, with the fat, upon the pieces of ox-tail, rinse 
out the frying-pan with hot water and add this to the soup-kettle. 
Now cover with two quarts of cold water; slice a carrot thin, 
mince four stalks of celery and add these to the water. Cover 
closely and simmer for five hours. Season to taste and set aside 
until next day, remove the fat and strain the liquor from meat 
and vegetables. Pick out the best joints and return to the soup. 
Heat to a fast boil, skim, add kitchen bouquet to taste, and serve. 
There should be two or three joints in each portion. Some cooks 
slice two or three very small carrots, parboil them and put into the 
strained liquor with the joints before giving the last boil. 

Clear brown soup 

After making, cooling and skimming your stock as directed in 
the beginning of this chapter, measure out a quart ; put over the 
fire and when lukewarm stir in the white of a raw egg. Bring 
quickly to a boil, stirring all the time. As soon as it bubbles, take 
from the fire, pour in a little very cold water and let it stand for 
three minutes. Then pour slowly off the dregs through a flannel 
bag, or a double cloth. Let it drip as you would jelly. When 
all has run through, return to the fire with a little soaked tapioca, 
or a handful of "manestra," such as comes in shapes for soups ; 
simmer five minutes, color with kitchen bouquet, or with caramel, 
and serve. 

Clear soup with poached eggs 

Make as directed above, but without tapioca or other cereal. 
Have ready as many neatly poached eggs as there will be people 
at table, and when the hot soup is in the tureen slip these care- 
fully into it. 



SOUPS 307 

Caramel for coloring soups 

Put two tablespoonfuls of sugar into a small tin cup and let it 
melt, then bubble over the fire. When you have a seething brown 
(not burnt) mass, pour in two tablespoonfuls of boiling water 
and stir until the sugar is dissolved. 

Put in enough to color your clear soup, but not enough to make 
it sweet. 

Clear soup a la royale 

To cleared soup made according to directions given for making 
and clearing stock, add minute squares of paste made thus : 

Heat half a cupful of milk in a saucepan with a bit of soda. In 
a frying-pan cook a tablespoonful of butter and stir into it two of 
flour. Turn the milk gradually upon this, and, when well incor- 
porated, a scant half-cupful of soup stock. In a bowl have ready 
two whipped eggs and pour upon them, stirring well, the hot mix- 
ture. Return to the fire, stir to a thick paste and pour upon a but- 
tered platter to cool. Set on ice to harden for at least six hours 
before cutting into tiny blocks. The soup must not boil after they 
go in. 

Glasgow broth 

One quart of strong mutton stock, from which every particle of 
fat has been removed. The liquor in which a leg of mutton has 
been boiled will do well for this purpose. Boil it down for an 
hour before making the broth, as it should be strong. 

One cupful of barley that has been soaked in tepid water for 
three hours. One large carrot, one turnip, two onions, four stalks 
of celery, half a cupful of green peas and the same of string-beans, 
parsley and four or five leek tops. 

Cut the vegetables up small and parboil them for ten min- 
utes. Drain and put over the fire in the stock. Simmer slowly 
for three hours. Have ready a good white roux made by heating 
a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a pan and stirring into it a 
tablespoonful of flour. Add a few spoonfuls of the soup to thin it, 
and stir into the broth. Boil one minute and serve. 



308 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

This recipe, given to me in rhymes a century old by a dis- 
tinguished professor in the University of Glasgow, is the genuine 
Scotch broth dear to the Scottish heart and stomach. It is no- 
where as delicious as in the Highlands, but it is good everywhere. 

Mulligatawney soup 

(An East Indian recipe.) 

Joint a large fowl, as for fricassee, and cut into small pieces 
a pound of lean veal. Slice two onions and fry them in butter ; 
pare, quarter and core two sour apples. Put all these into a sauce- 
pan with six quarts of cold water. Add four cloves and four pep- 
per corns, cover closely and let it simmer until the fowl is tender. 
Remove it and cut the meat from the bones into small pieces. 
Return the bones to the kettle and add one level tablespoonful of 
curry powder, one level teaspoonful, each, of salt and sugar mixed 
to a smooth paste with a little water. 

Simmer another hour, or until reduced one-half, strain the soup, 
let it stand all night and remove the fat. Put it on to boil again, 
add the pieces of fowl and one cupful of boiled rice. This will 
make a large quantity of soup. Send around with it bananas, 
chilled by burying them in ice, for those who relish this accom- 
paniment to curry dishes. 

Chicken cream soup (No. 1) 

Cut up a large fowl and beat with a mallet to crack the 
bones ; pour in five quarts of cold water, cover closely and sim- 
mer for four hours more, until the chicken is perfectly tender. 
Take the meat off the bones, take out the skin. Return the soup 
to the fire with a part of the meat chopped fine, salt, pepper, a 
little boiled rice and butter rolled in flour. Just before taking 
from the fire add a small teacupful of cream heated with a pinch 
of soda ; add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley and boil for one 
minute. 

You may further enrich this excellent soup by beating up two 
eggs and stirring them into it just before taking from the fire. 



SOUPS 309 

A still better way is to pour a little of the soup upon the eggs to 
avoid curdling, then add to the rest. 



Chicken cream soup (No. 2) 

(An English recipe) 

One cupful of cold roast chicken, chopped as fine as powder ; a 
pint of strong chicken broth ; a cupful of sweet cream ; half a cup- 
ful of bread or cracker-crumbs ; 'three yolks of eggs ; one tea- 
spoonful of salt ; one-half teaspoonful of pepper. 

Soak the crumbs in a little of the cream. Bring the broth to 
boiling point and add the meat. Break the eggs, separating the 
yolks and whites. Drop the yolks carefully into boiling water 
and boil hard ; then rub to a powder and add to the soup with the 
cream and the seasoning. Simmer ten minutes and serve hot. 

Beef bouillon 

Put together in an agate-lined saucepan two pounds of lean 
beef, minced ; one-half pound of lean veal, also minced, and two 
pounds, each, of beef and veal bones, well cracked. Cover deep 
with cold water and bring slowly to a boil, then sim- 
mer for four hours. Season with salt, pepper and two 
teaspoonfuls of kitchen bouquet, then remove from 
the fire. When very cold and like a jelly, skim all fat from the 
surface of the soup and heat to enable you to strain out the bones 
and meat. Return to the fire, drop in the white of an egg and a 
crushed egg-shell, bring to a boil, drop in a bit of ice to check 
ebullition and, five minutes later, pour carefully, not to disturb 
the dregs, through a colander lined with white flannel. You 
may now heat it to scalding, add a glass of sherry and eat it hot, 
or set on ice when cold until you can have it as "iced-bouillon." 
It is good in either way. 




310 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Bouillon a la russe 

Make as just directed and serve in cups, laying a delicately 
poached egg upon the surface of the steaming liquid. 

Chicken bouillon (No. 1) 

Cut a large fowl into pieces; put into a porcelain-lined kettle 
and cover with cold water. Set at the side of the range and sim- 
mer for four hours. Season with celery salt, pepper and onion 
juice, and set away to cool. When cold skim off the fat and strain 
out the bones and meat. Return to the fire, and when hot, add a 
quarter of a box of gelatine that has soaked for an hour in a gill 
of water. When the gelatine is dissolved, take the soup from the 
fire, strain through a cheese-cloth bag, and serve it when you 
have reheated it, or set aside to cool, afterward keeping it in ice, 
when you may enjoy delicious "iced and jellied chicken bouillon." 

Chicken bouillon (No. 2) 

Cut a four-pound fowl into pieces and put it over the fire with 
four quarts of cold water. Bring very slowly to the boiling point, 
and simmer gently for three hours, or until the meat is so tender 
that it slips from the bones. Add half of a sliced onion and three 
stalks of celery, and simmer for an hour longer. Turn into a 
bowl and set in a cold place for some hours. When thoroughly 
chilled remove the fat from the surface of the soup, strain out the 
bones and skim. If the liquor is jellied after skimming it, set it 
on the fire long enough to melt the jelly from the bones. Strain 
through coarse muslin, letting it drip through, but not squeezing 
the bag. Put over the fire and, when lukewarm, throw in the un- 
beaten white and broken shell of an egg ; stir to a quick boil and 
again strain through muslin after seasoning to taste. 

Gumbo (No. 1) 

(A Creole recipe) 

Cut a fowl at every joint and fry for five minutes in good drip- 
ping or in butter. Remove the meat and put into a soup kettle. 



SOUPS 311 

Cook two sliced onions in the fat left in the frying-pan. Put into 
the kettle with the chicken half a pound of lean salt pork, or 
corned ham, cut into small bits, and the fried onions. Add two 
quarts of cold water, and bring- slowly to a boil, after which you 
should let it simmer two hours. Add, now, two dozen young okra 
pods, half a pod of green pepper, chopped, and half a can of toma- 
toes, or a pint of fresh, cut small, and simmer till the chicken is 
tender. Remove the larger bones, add salt to taste, and five min- 
utes before serving add one pint of fine, sweet corn pulp, scraped 
from the cob, or one small can of canned corn, or one pint of 
oysters. Stir in a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour, boil a 
few minutes and serve. If fresh okra can not be obtained use 
the canned. 

Gumbo (No. 2) 

This delicious soup may be made with oysters, or shrimps, or 
chicken. Brown one small onion in a heaping tablespoonful of 
butter. Add one quart of sliced okra, and fry it well, stirring all 
the time to prevent burning. Now add half a gallon of hot water 
and let it cook until simmered down to one quart. Add three ripe 
tomatoes and the chicken, or oysters, or shrimps. If the chicken 
is used it must have been previously stewed tender, in which case 
use the broth instead of the hot water. Season to taste with salt 
and cayenne, and serve with a tablespoonful of rice for each soup- 
plate. 

Julienne soup 

Cut into thin strips, and these into inch lengths, two carrots, 
one-half of a white turnip, two or three celery stalks, two small 
onions, a leaf or two of young cabbage, and a good handful of 
string beans. Put all together, with half a cupful of green peas, 
into cold salted water, and leave for half an hour. Turn, then, 
into your soup kettle with sufficient water to cover, and cook for 
fifteen minutes. Drain off the water, cover the vegetables with a 
quart of good soup stock or consomme, and cook gently for twen- 
ty-five minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper, add chopped 



312 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

parsley and kitchen bouquet to taste, and boil up once before 
serving. You may add tomatoes or not, as you like. 
The stock should be strong. 

French onion soup 

To a quart of good stock allow six small onions that have been 
parboiled for ten minutes, and a cupful of fine, dry bread-crumbs. 
Let them simmer together for half an hour ; rub the soup through 
a colander, pressing through as much of the onion and bread as 
possible. Put into a saucepan, rub one tablespoonful of butter 
and two of flour to a cream, and stir into the hot mixture until it 
thickens. Season with salt and pepper, add one pint of milk 
heated with a tiny bit of soda, boil up, and serve. 

A homely, but a savory soup. 

White barley soup 

Soak a cupful of barley for several hours in enough water to 
cover it ; then boil in a quart of veal stock until tender and clear. 
Season with a teaspoonful of onion juice, a tablespoonful of 
minced parsley, and with celery salt and white pepper to taste. 
Thicken a pint of scalding milk with a white roux, pour the hot 
soup slowly upon this and serve. 

"Turkey rack" soup 

(A Virginia recipe) 

Break the carcass of a roast turkey served for yesterday's din- 
ner into pieces, removing all the stuffing ; cover with two quarts of 
cold water and boil three hours, covered. Set aside until cold; 
skim and take out all the bones; chop the meat; add to the 
soup and meat the stuffing rubbed through a colander, a sliced 
onion and a stalk of celery, cut very small. Simmer for an hour ; 
put a cupful of milk over the fire, not forgetting a pinch of soda ; 
when hot, stir in a tablespoonful of butter rubbed into one of 
flour ; mix with the soup, and boil one minute. * 



SOUPS 313 

A white fowl soup 

Cut an elderly chicken up as for fricassee, severing every joint. 
Put into the soup-kettle, allowing a quart of water for every 
pound. Add a sliced onion and three celery stalks. Set at the side 
of the range ; bring slowly to the boil. Cook until the meat slips 
from the bones, if it takes all day. Set away with the meat in it 
until cold. Take off the fat. Warm sufficiently to allow you to 
strain it ; take out the bones ; cut the white meat into cubes, and 
keep hot over boiling water. Bring the soup to a boil, season 
with salt and white pepper, and throw into it, while boiling hard, 
half a cupful of rice. Cook fast for twenty-five minutes, or until 
the rice is very tender. Have ready in a saucepan a cupful of hot 
milk into which you have put a bit of soda ; stir in a white roux 
made by cooking a tablespoonful of butter with one of flour, and 
add to the soup with a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Now, 
put in the meat cubes, boil one minute and serve. 

A brown fowl soup 

Prepare and cook chicken as just directed, and, when you have 
skimmed the soup and taken out the bones, cut all the meat into 
neat cubes ; dry it between two cloths ; pepper and salt, then 
dredge well with flour. Put into a frying-pan four taniespoonfuls 
of the fat you have taken from the soup and when it bubbles, add 
the pieces of chicken and toss them about until well browned. 
Remove the chicken and keep it hot. Into the fat left in the pan 
put one level tablespoonful of flour and stir until well mixed and 
slightly browned. Add by degrees sufficient soup to moisten to a 
smooth gravy, then strain it into the soup. Season to taste, put 
in the chicken dice, simmer five minutes, and serve. You may im- 
prove the color by adding a teaspoon ful of kitchen bouquet. 

Beef juice for invalids 

Chop two pounds of lean beef small. Put a layer of this meat 
in the bottom of a glass jar and sprinkle over it a little salt. Then 



3H MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

add another layer and a little more salt, and so on until the meat 
has been used. Set in a kettle. The water in the kettle should be 
cold and be heated gradually to the boiling point, after which it 
should be left to simmer for three or four hours, or until the meat 
looks like bits of white rags with the juice completely drawn out. 
Let all get cold together, then skim, and strain out the meat, press- 
ing it hard. 

Beef tea 

Chop three pounds of lean beef fine and leave in a quart of cold 
water for two hours. Set water and beef over a slow fire in a 
covered saucepan and simmer four hours. Set away all night 
with the meat in it. In the morning remove every bit of grease, 
and strain through coarse muslin, pressing hard. Season with 
pepper and salt. 

BISQUES 

THE name is applied to a class of soups thickened into closer 
consistency than broth by the addition of minced meat and 
crumbs. When well made, they are popular at family dinners, and 
some kinds such as oyster and lobster bisque are admirable at 
dinner parties. 

Care must be observed to keep the ingredients well together, 
and to season judiciously. Insipid panada is not a bisque. Still 
less is a "mess" compounded, not wisely, but so well as to remind 
one of a poultice. 

Oyster bisque 

Drain the liquor from a quart of oysters and make of it a quart 
of liquid by adding cold water. Into this stir the oysters, chopped 
fine, and put all into a porcelain-lined saucepan over the fire. 
Cook very gently for twenty minutes. Have heated a quart of 
milk, in which a pinch of soda has been dissolved, and half a cup- 
ful of cracker-crumbs, soaked. Cook together in a saucepan two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour. When they are perfectly 
blended pour upon them the quart of thickened boiling milk and 



SOUPS 315 

stir until as smooth and thick as cream. Turn into this the oyster 
soup and season to taste with salt and pepper. Slowly pour a 
cupful of the soup upon the beaten yolks of 1;wo eggs, stirring 
constantly. When mixed, return the soup with the blended yolks 
to the saucepan, stir and pour at once into a heated tureen. 

Lobster bisque 

Two cupfuls of lobster meat, minced fine ; one quart of boiling 
water and the same of milk ; half a cupful of butter and a cupful of 
fine cracker-crumbs ; paprika or cayenne and salt to taste ; a tea- 
spoonful of flour. 

Rub the coral and a quarter of the meat to a paste ; leave this in 
enough boiling water to cover it for half an hour. Then put the 
reserved chopped lobster into a saucepan, with the cracker-crumbs 
and half the butter ; stir in the hot water and coral, etc., with the 
rest of the quart of boiling water. Cook gently half an hour in a 
double boiler after the water in the outer vessel begins to boil 
hard. Stir often. In another saucepan heat the milk (with a bit 
of soda) and the rest of the butter worked up with the flour. Boil 
one minute. Turn the lobster into the tureen ; stir in the hot milk 
and serve at once. 

Crab bisque 

Is made in the same way. 

Clam bisque 

Thirty clams; one cupful of milk and half as much cream, 
or two cupfuls of milk ; two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of 
flour; three eggs; a tablespoonful of onion juice; one cupful of 
boiling water ; a pinch of soda in the milk ; one cupful of cracker- 
crumbs. 

Chop the clams and put over the fire in the boiling water. Sim- 
mer half an hour. Heat milk and cream in another saucepan with 
the soda and crumbs. Stir in the roux, boil one minute and pour 
gradually, beating all the time, upon the yolks, previously whipped 
smooth. Heat in a double boiler for two minutes, or until the 



3 i6 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

water in the outer vessel boils hard, and turn into the tureen. 
Season the boiling mince of clams with salt, cayenne and minced 
parsley, add to the milk in tureen and cover the surface with the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a standing froth. 

In serving, dip the ladle deep into the bisque, but see that each 
plate is mantled by the meringue. 

Chicken bisque 

Joint the fowl and cover with cold water, a quart for each 
pound. Put in a large minced onion and three stalks of celery, 
minced fine. Cover and cook slowly until you can slip the flesh 
from the bones. Let all get cold together; skim, take out bones 
and meat, and chop the latter fine. Return the soup to the fire 
and heat in another vessel a cupful of milk (dropping in a bit 
of soda). Thicken this with a tablespoonful of butter rubbed 
into a teasponful of flour, and add a tablespoonful of minced 
parsley. When the soup has reached a fast boil, stir into it the 
chopped chicken with a cupful of cracker-crumbs soaked in warm 
milk ; boil one minute, beat in the milk and butter and pour out. 

Corn bisque 

Drain the liquor from a can of corn. Chop the corn very fine, 
put it over the fire in a quart of salted water and simmer gently 
for an hour. Rub through a colander, return to the fire with the 
water, add a teaspoon ful of sugar, and when this melts, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour rubbed into two of butter. Stir until smooth 
and pour slowly upon a pint of heated milk. Season with salt and 
pour the soup gradually upon two beaten eggs. Send immediately 
to the table. 

Cheese bisque 

Into a pint of milk put a pinch of soda, and bring to the scald- 
ing point. To this add a cupful of stock (chicken or mutton or 
lamb) in which an onion has been boiled, and a cupful of water in 
which rice has been cooked until you can run it through a strainer. 
Cook together in a good -sized saucepan two tablespoonfuls of but- 



SOUPS 317 

ter and two of flour. When they are thoroughly blended and bub- 
ble pour on them the white soup and stir until it thickens to the 
consistency of cream. Now beat in a half cupful of grated cheese. 
Have ready in a bowl two well-whipped eggs, and on these pour, a 
little at a time, a cupful of hot soup, beating steadily to prevent 
curdling. Return the cupful of soup wi*h the eggs to the soup on 
the fire, beat for half a minute, season with salt and pepper, and 
serve. Odd, but very good when properly made. 

Salmon bisque 

Open a can of salmon and turn out the contents several hours 
before making the soup. With a silver fork pick the fish to 
pieces and take out all bits of bone and skin. Put the fish into an 
agate saucepan, put on it enough boiling water to cover it, and 
let it simmer gently for half an hour. Drain off the water and 
break the fish to a soft mass. 

Dissolve a pinch of soda in a pint of milk and heat in a double 
boiler with a half cupful of cracker-crumbs. Stir into it a pint of 
well-seasoned veal stock, and thicken with two tablespoonfuls of 
flour rubbed into two of butter. When thick and smooth, stir in 
the minced fish, season with salt and paprika, and serve. This is 
very good when made of boiled fresh salmon. 

Bisque of halibut or cod 

Boil a pound of firm fresh fish in two waters, and mince it fine, 
freeing it from all bits of skin or bone. Have ready a quart of 
white stock, stir the fish into it and season with salt, pepper and 
a spoonful of minced parsley. Cook together two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and one of flour, pour upon this a cupful of milk, stir 
until it thickens, and put with the fish and stock. Boil up once 
and put into the tureen. A half cupful of powdered cracker- 
crumbs should be added just before the soup is mixed with the 
milk, 



318 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Tomato bisque (No, 1) 

Two cupfuls of fresh tomatoes, chopped fine ; one pint of strong 
stock or skimmed gravy; one cupful of fine crumbs soaked for 
half an hour in hot milk; one teaspoonful of white sugar; one 
tablespoonful of onion juice ; pepper and salt to taste ; one table- 
spoonful of butter cooked to a roux with one of flour; chopped 
parsley; cook together five minutes, run through a vegetable 
press, stir in the stock and seasoning, and return to the fire. 
Simmer twenty minutes and add the soaked crumbs and parsley ; 
cook together five minutes, stir in as much baking-soda as will 
lie upon a dime and send in at once. 

You may use canned tomatoes for this recipe if you have not 
fresh. 

Tomato bisque (No. 2) 

Stir one quart can of tomatoes with a half-teaspoonful of soda 
for half an hour. Boil half a gallon of fresh milk ; add to it a 
quarter of a pound of butter, pepper and salt. Mash the tomatoes 
through a colander and stir them into the boiling milk ; add a tea- 
cupful of rolled crackers ; serve immediately. If the milk is put 
into the tomatoes it will curdle. 



CREAM SOUPS 

N. B. See to it that the milk of which they are made is fresh, 
and always drop in it before heating a pinch of baking-soda to 
avoid the danger of curdling. A curdled cream soup is a cul- 
inary solecism, and should never be put into delicate stomachs. 
After the soup is ready for the table do not allow it to stand on

water for five minutes after you have added a tablespoonful of 
finely-minced parsley. 

Eel soup 

Two pounds of eels, cleaned and cut into inch-lengths; two 
tablespoonfuls of butter cooked to a roux with one of flour ; three 
pints of water, one sliced onion, a pinch of mace and a larger of 
cayenne; salt to taste; dripping for frying; one tablespoonful of 
minced parsley. Juice of a lemon. 

Heat the dripping hissing hot and fry the sliced onion in it. 



336 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Now put in the eels when you have wiped them dry, and fry on 
both sides to a light brown. Turn all into a covered saucepan, 
pour in the cold water and cook slowly for an hour. Season 
then, stir in the roux ; simmer three minutes, put in the lemon 
juice and serve. 

Catfish soup 

May be made in the same way. 

Chicken broth 

Cover a jointed fowl with cold water and boil until tender. 
Set aside the liquor in which the fowl was boiled until very cold. 
Remove meat and bones, and skim, removing every particle of fat. 
Put two quarts of this chicken-stock on the fire, season with salt 
and a little white pepper, bring to a boil and stir in six table- 
spoonfuls of rice that has been soaked for an hour in cold water. 
Add a little onion juice and cook until the rice is soft. Now 
stir in a tablespoonful of minced parsley and cook for ten minutes 
longer. Heat a pint of milk into which a pinch of baking soda 
has been stirred. Cook together a heaping tablespoonful, each, 
of butter and flour, and when they bubble, pour upon them the 
pint of heated milk, stirring until you have a smooth white sauce. 
Into this beat gradually two well-whipped eggs. Stir over the 
fire for half-a-minute, and pour the egg and milk mixture into 
a heated tureen. Into this pour slowly, beating steadily, the 
chicken soup. Season to taste and serve at once. 



FISH 

Baked red snapper 

A FISH that is earning, and honestly, much popularity. It 
would have all it deserved if it were always cooked properly. It 
is not a fish with which one can take liberties. 

Draw, clean and wipe a five-pound red snapper and wash inside 
and out with salad oil and lemon. Make a stuffing as follows: 
One well-beaten egg, one-half cupful of powdered cracker and one 
cupful of oysters, drained and chopped. Season with one tea- 
spoonful of onion juice, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one-eighth teaspoonful of paprika and one tablespoonful 
of minced parsley, and moisten with cream and oyster liquor. It 
should be quite moist. Fill the fish and sew the edges together 
with fine white cotton. 

Put a layer of minced fat pork on the grating of your covered 
roaster, lay a few slices of tomato and onion on the pork, then 
the fish on this. Dredge the top with salt and flour, and put on 
more minced pork. Place it in a hot oven, add a cupful of boiling 
water, and cover. Baste often, and add more water after each 
basting. Bake about one hour. Remove to a hot dish and serve 
with sauce Hollandaise. 

Boiled red snapper 

Clean, wash, wipe dry and sew up in coarse white mosquito 
netting. Put it into boiling water deep enough to cover the 
fish, and which has been salted and flavored with lemon juice. 
Let the water come to the boiling point, then reduce the heat so 
it will merely bubble. Simmer about half an hour. Lift care- 
fully from the water, drain and unwrap; put it into a hot dish. 
Garnish with parsley and serve with tomato sauce or with sauce 
Hollandaise.

Steamed red snapper 

Cover the bottom of your steamer with sliced tomatoes, and 
on these strew minced onion. Clean, wash and dry the fish ; lay 
upon the prepared bed and steam slowly at least one hour for a 
fish weighing four pounds. Open the steamer once, and turn 
the fish very carefully. Serve with oyster sauce or with sauce 
tartare. 

Baked bluefish 

Clean, wash and wipe a large bluefish. Lay it in a baking-pan, 
dash over it a cupful of boiling salted water, and bake, covered, 
for an hour, basting it often to prevent burning. When tender 
and brown, transfer the fish to a hot dish, and keep it warm while 
you set the pan containing the gravy in which it was cooked on 
the range and thicken it with browned flour, adding to flavor it 
a pinch of salt, one of pepper, a tablespoonful of catsup and a little 
good table sauce. Lay slices of lemon about the fish on the plat- 
ter, and serve the sauce from a gravy-boat. 

Broiled bluefish 

Clean, wash, wipe and split down the back ; dust with salt and 
pepper and broil over a clear fire. Transfer to a hot dish and 
cover with a mixture of butter, lemon juice and very finely- 
minced parsley, rubbed to a cream. Cover and set over hot water 
for five minutes before serving. 

Pass Parisienne potatoes with it. 

Boiled black bass with cream gravy 

Put in a pot enough slightly salted water to cover the fish, 
add a gill of vinegar, an onion, eight whole peppers and a blade of 
mace. Sew up the fish in a piece of thin cheese-cloth fitted snugly 
to it. Lay in the water; bring very slowly to the simmering 
point, and then boil steadily, allowing twelve minutes to each 
pound of the fish. When done remove the cloth, lay the fish on 
a platter garnished with sliced lemon, and serve with the cream 
gravy given below. 



FISH 339 

Cream gravy for black bass 

Cook together a tablespoonful, each, of butter and flour, and 
when blended strain slowly upon them a cupful of the water in 
which the bass was boiled, and stir until smooth and thick. Sea- 
son to taste with celery salt and white pepper, and stir in a gill 
of cream to which a pinch of baking-soda has been added. Make 
very hot, but do not boil, and as soon as hot remove from the fire. 

Baked sea bass with shrimp sauce 

Clean, wipe and anoint abundantly, inside and out, with a mix- 
ture of salad oil and vinegar. Set on ice for an hour to let the 
"marinade" mellow the fish. 

Have ready half a pound of rindless fat pork, cut as thin as 
shavings. Lay half upon the bottom of your covered bakepan, 
put the fish upon them, and spread the upper side with the rest. 
Pour a little hot water in the pan to generate steam ; cover and 
bake one hour, if the fish be large, basting three times with butter 
and water. Transfer to a hot dish, and set over hot water while 
you make the sauce. 

Shrimp sauce for baked bass 

Strain the gravy left in the pan, and stir in a brown roux made 
by heating a great spoonful of butter in a frying-pan and working 
in a tablespoonful of browned flour. Add four tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water to gravy and roux, or enough to bring it to the 
consistency of cream, then the juice of half a lemon, cayenne or 
paprika to taste ; lastly, half a can of shrimps, chopped fine. Boil 
one minute, pour some over the fish, the rest into a gravy-boat. 

Stuffed sea bass 

Clean, wipe and lay for an hour in a marinade of salad oil and 
vinegar. Fill with a forcemeat of minced salt pork and chopped 
champignons. Fresh mushrooms are, of course, better, if you can 
get them. Bake upon shavings of fat salt pork as directed in last 



340 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

recipe. When it has baked forty minutes, cover with fresh toma- 
toes, peeled and sliced thin, and half a sweet green pepper, minced. 
Drop bits of butter upon the tomatoes, and bake twenty minutes 
longer. 

Take up the fish and keep hot while you strain the gravy left 
in the pan, rubbing the tomatoes and pepper through a colander ; 
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, rolled in flour, add a teaspoonful 
of sugar and two of onion juice, with hot water if too thick; 
boil one minute; pour half over the fish, the rest into a sauce- 
boat. 

Muskelonge 

The coarse pickerel of the northern rivers and lakes are very 
nice, cooked as above directed. Bluefish may be treated in the 
same way. 

Baked shad 

Wash and wipe a large shad. Make a stuffing of fine bread- 
crumbs mixed with melted butter, a little minced onion, pepper 
and salt to taste. Fill the fish "with this and 
sew it up. Lay it in a baking-pan and pour 
over it a cupful of salted boiling water in which 
two tablespoonfuls of butter have been melted. 
Sprinkle the fish with flour and bake in a steady 
oven. Baste with the drippings every ten min- 
utes. At the end of three-quarters of an hour 
try the fish with a fork to see if it is done. It 
should be very tender. Transfer carefully to a hot platter, cut 
and remove the strings. Keep the fish hot while you make the 
sauce. 

Set on the top of the range the pan in which the fish has been 
baked. Thicken the fish drippings with two tablespoonfuls of 
browned flour wet up with cold water. Stir until smooth, then 
add a cupful of boiling water, the juice of a lemon, a tablespoonful 
of good table sauce and a teaspoonful of good kitchen bouquet. 
Unless the sauce is perfectly smooth, strain through a wire sieve. 
Pour into a heated gravy-boat. 




FISH 341 

Boiled fresh codfish 

Lay the fish in salt and water for an hour before cooking. 
Choose a "chunky" piece, as nearly square as you can get it. 
Sew up in white mosquito netting fitted to the shape of the fish. 
Put on in enough boiling water to cover it, adding four table-- 
Spoonfuls of vinegar, and cook steadily ten minutes to the pound. 
Unwrap the fish and pour over it half of the sauce described be- 
low, putting the rest into a gravy-boat. 

Egg sauce for boiled codfish 

Make a white sauce by cooking together a tablespoonful, each, 
of butter and of flour until they bubble, pouring upon them a 
half pint of milk and stirring until thick and smooth. To this add 
one hard-boiled egg, chopped fine, one raw egg, beaten light, 
putting it in slowly, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour over the 
fish in the dish or serve in a sauce-tureen. 

Baked fresh codfish with cheese sauce 

Cut a neat square or oblong of codfish, lay in salt and water 
for half an hour; wipe dry and rub all over with melted butter 
and lemon juice. In the bottom of your baking-pan under the 
grating and just not touching the fish, have a cupful of veal 
stock, or weak gravy, strained. Pepper and salt the fish, cover 
and bake ten minutes to the pound. Take up then and sift dry, 
fine crumbs thickly all over it. Put dots of butter on these. Set 
in the oven, uncovered, to brown while you strain the gravy from 
the pan, thicken with butter rolled in browned flour, add the juice 
of half a lemon, four tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese 
and a little onion juice. Boil one minute, pour a few spoonfuls 
carefully upon the crumb-crust of the fish, the rest into a boat. 

This is an elegant company dish of fish, and easy of prepara- 
tion. 

Baked fillets of halibut 

Cut slices of halibut, weighing a pound each, and an inch thick. 
Cut each into three strips, two fingers wide, lay in lemon juice 



342 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

and salad oil for an hour; then cook precisely as directed above. 
When you sift the crumbs over the fillets, cover all sides; then 
proceed as with the baked cod, taking care to arrange the fillets 
for browning so that they will not touch one another. 

Baked halibut 

Lay a piece of halibut weighing about four pounds in cold water 
(salted) for half an hour, then wipe dry and lay in a covered 
roaster. Pour over it a cupful of boiling water, in which have 
been melted two tablespoonfuls of butter. Bake until tender and 
keep hot on a platter while you thicken the gravy left in the pan 
with browned flour and butter, and season with a teaspoonful, 
each, of lemon and onion juice, a little celery salt and a wineglass- 
ful of claret. Strain, and send to the table in a gravy-boat. 

Baked halibut steak (No. 1) 

Lay the steak in salted water for fifteen minutes; wipe and 
put into a baking-pan. Rub the steak with butter, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and pour over and around it a cupful of milk. 
Bake, basting every ten minutes until the milk is absorbed. Serve 
with drawn butter. 

Send around fried potatoes with it. 

Baked halibut steak (No. 2) 

Wash, wipe and lay in marinade of olive oil and lemon juice 
for one hour. Sprinkle, then, liberally, with minced onion, pars- 
ley and lemon juice, turning over and over that the steak may be 
covered. Now, lay upon the grating of your bakepan. Make a 
white sauce by stirring one cupful of hot milk into one tablespoon- 
ful of butter cooked into a roux with one of flour. Season it with 
salt and pepper, and pour it over the fish. Cover the surface 
with fine crumbs moistened in melted butter and bake until the 
fish is done, about twelve minutes to the pound. 



FISH 343 

Halibut steak baked with tomatoes 
(A Creole recipe.) 

Make a rich sauce of tomatoes, fresh or canned, seasoning with 
butter rolled in flour, sugar, pepper, onion juice and salt, adding, 
if you have it, a sweet green pepper, seeded and minced. Cook 
fifteen minutes, strain, rubbing through a colander, and cool. 
Lay the halibut in oil and lemon juice for an hour, place upon 
the grating of your covered roaster, pour the sauce over it ; cover 
and bake twelve minutes to the pound if the oven be good. Sift 
Parmesan cheese over the fish, and cook five minutes longer. 
Serve upon a hot dish, pouring the sauce over it. 

Baked fillets of flounder 

Take the backbone out of the fish and cut each half into two 
neat, long slices. Roll each piece up and pin with a wooden skewer. 
A new toothpick will do. Lay in salad oil and lemon juice for 
an hour, setting in the ice to make the fish firm while soaking 
in the marinade. 

Roll in fine dry crumbs, peppered and salted; in beaten egg, 
and again in crumbs. Cover the grating of your bakepan with 
thin shavings of salt pork, lay the fillets upon them, sprinkle thick- 
ly with finely-minced onion and olives, and bake, covered, twelve 
minutes for each pound. Lift carefully to a hot dish ; withdraw 
the skewers. Garnish with sliced lemon and send to table. 

Fried fillets of flounder 

Cut, trim and marinade as for baking. When you take them 
from the ice, roll as for baking, salt and pepper, roll in crumbs, 
then in egg, and again in crumbs. Leave on ice for half an 
hour longer, and fry in deep hot cottolene, salad oil, or other fat. 
Drain, withdraw the skewers and serve with sauce tartare. 

Baked fresh, mackerel 

Marinade for half an hour in olive oil and lemon juice. Lay 
thin slices of pork upon the grating of a baking-pan, lay the 



344 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

mackerel on the pork, skim down, sprinkle lightly with salt and 
pepper, and bake in a hot oven for twenty-five minutes. 
Serve with tomato sauce. 

Boiled salmon-trout 

Select a small fish for this purpose, as a large one will not fit 
into the ordinary-sized fish-kettle. Have in your kettle enough 
salted boiling water to cover the fish, and add two tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar to the water. Sew the fish up in a piece of firm cheese- 
cloth, and lay it carefully in the kettle. After it begins to boil, 
allow twelve minutes to the pound. When done take out of the 
water carefully, remove the cloth and transfer the fish to a hot 
platter. Sprinkle with pepper and salt, and pour over it a well- 
seasoned white sauce. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon and 
sprigs of parsley. 

Baked salmon 

Wipe your fish with a damp cloth, but do not lay it in water. 
Rub with a little salad oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Lay in a baking-pan and dash over it a cupful of boiling water in 
which two tablespoonfuls of butter have been melted. Bake, 
covered, basting every fifteen minutes. Whan done transfer to 
a hot platter and set in the open oven while you thicken the gravy 
left in the pan with corn-starch wet with cold water, and sea- 
son it with lemon juice and a dash of onion juice. A little to- 
mato catsup is an improvement. Boil up once and pour into a 
gravy-boat. Send to the table with the salmon, which may be 
garnished with sprigs of parsley. 

Baked pickerel 

Clean and wash the fish. Choose a large fine one for this 
purpose. Lay it on the grating of your bakepan, dredge with 
salt and pepper, butter well and dredge with flour. Put into a 
hot oven, and when the flour begins to brown, baste with butter, 
water and lemon juice. Cook twelve minutes to the pound, re- 
move, and serve with oyster sauce.

FISH 345 

Boned baked pickerel 

Have your fishmonger take out the backbone when he has split 
the fish lengthwise, also have him extract every other bone he 
can get out without tearing the flesh too much. Marinade for an 
hour in a bath of olive oil and lemon juice. Cover the grating 
of your bakepan with thin shavings of salt pork, lay the fish upon 
this, skin-side downward, wash with melted butter, bake, cov- 
ered, half an hour, baste and cook ten minutes more. Serve with 
Hollandaise sauce 1 . 

Baked salmon-trout with cream gravy 

Clean and wash, wipe dry, and go all over it, inside and out, 
with melted butter and lemon juice. Lay upon the grating of 
your bakepan, pour in a little boiling water, not quite touching the 
fish, and bake twelve minutes to the pound, basting twice with 
butter and twice with the water in the pan below. 

Keep hot in heated dish, covered, set over boiling water while 
you strain the gravy left in the pan, add to it a cupful of hot milk 
(half cream, if you can get it) scalded with a pinch of soda, 
thickened with a white roux of butter cooked with flour, and 
seasoned with paprika, salt and a little minced parsley. Pour 
over the fish, let it stand three minutes over hot water and serve. 

Fried brook trout 

Clean with care, roll in peppered and salted flour; set on ice 
for an hour, and fry immediately in deep fat to a golden-brown. 
Have a mat of folded and heated tissue paper fringed at the ends, 
and lay the drained fish upon it. Eat at once. 

Broiled soft-shell crabs 

Lift the projecting "wings" of the upper shell, and cut or pull 
off the "feathers" you will find under them. Next trim off the 
tail, or flap, or "apron," a round piece of softer shell on the under 
side of the upper. 



346 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Wash quickly and cook without delay lest they die on your 
hands. 

Wash with butter, sprinkle with salt and cayenne pepper, lay 
within a reversible wire broiler, and cook over clear coals ten 
minutes, turning twice to broil both sides. 

Serve upon thin slices of buttered toast. 

Fried soft-shell crabs 

Prepare as directed in preceding recipe, sprinkle with cayenne 
and salt, roll in beaten egg, then in fine crumbs, again in egg, 
and once more in crumbs and fry in deep, hot fat. 

Garnish with water-cress, and pass sliced lemon with them. 

Lobster broiled in the shell 

Kill the lobster by cutting the tail off with one stroke of the 
knife, just where it joins the body. With another clean cut di- 
vide him lengthwise into two equal parts, shell and all. Take out 
the coral, the one long intestine and the stomach. Crack the claws 
with a hammer. Put within a buttered broiler, split side down- 
ward, and broil over a fierce fire. As soon as the juice begins to 
run freely withdraw long enough to wash liberally with melted 
butter, and return to the fire, turning often to keep in the juices. 
Cook about ten minutes on the split or flesh side, and eight upon 
the other. 

Have ready a sauce made by rubbing two tablespoonfuls of 
butter to a cream with lemon juice and finely-minced parsley, 
adding a little cayenne, and wash the lobster with this while hiss- 
ing hot. Serve half a lobster to each guest, with oyster forks 
for extracting the meat. 

Pass more sauce for those who wish it. 

Lobster baked in shell 

Prepare as for broiling, but lay, shell downward, in a bakepan, 
cover and set in a quick oven, opening in ten minutes to wash 
with butter. They should be done in twenty minutes, when wash 
freely with the lemon and butter sauce. 



FISH 347 

Lobster scalloped in shells 

Two cupfuls of lobster meat, cut into small dice. One cupful of 
white stock, and the same of unskimmed milk. Two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter made into a white roux with one tablespoonful of 
flour. Salt and paprika to taste. Minced parsley and juice of 
half a lemon. Beaten yolks of two eggs. Halves of two lobster 
shells, cleaned. Pinch of soda in milk.

butter, sprinkle with cayenne and bake to a delicate brown. 

Lobster a la Newburg 

Pick all the meat from the shells of two good-sized freshly- 
boiled lobsters and cut into one-inch pieces, which place in a 
saucepan over a hot range, together with two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, and season with a pinch of salt and one of cayenne. Cook 
five minutes, pour in a glass of sherry ; simmer five minutes, add 
the beaten yolks of three eggs and a cupful of cream, stirring all 
the time. When it thickens, pour out and serve. 

Do not omit to put a pinch of soda in the cream. 

Stewed terrapin 
(A Maryland recipe.) 

Drop the "diamond-backs" into boiling water and cook until 
the heads and feet "skin off." This should be in less than an 
hour. Let them get perfectly cold. Strip off the shells and ex- 
tract the heart and entrails carefully, lest an incautious touch rup- 
ture the gall-bag and ruin everything. Cut off the head, tail and 
feet. Cut the meat up small with a sharp knife, put into a sauce- 
pan, cover with hot water and simmer fifteen minutes. Rub the 
yolks of half a dozen hard-boiled eggs to a powder and work in 
three tablespoonfuls of butter. Heat a cupful of cream in another 
vessel (with a pinch of soda) and work by degrees into the egg 
and butter, season with salt and cayenne and mix gradually with 



348 MARION HAKLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the hot terrapin. Cook one minute, add a glass of sherry and 
pour out. 

Fricasseed snapping turtle 

Have your fish merchant clean your turtle after he has killed 
him by throwing him into boiling water. Cut the turtle into neat 
dice, sprinkle with salt, pepper, onion juice, a dash of kitchen 
bouquet and a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup. Turn into a 
saucepan, add just enough cold water to cover the meat, fit a top 
on the vessel and simmer for half an hour. Now add a table- 
spoonful of browned flour rubbed to a paste with a great spoon- 
ful of butter ; when this is blended with the liquid in the pan, 
add a glass of sherry and stir in very gradually the beaten 'yolk 
of an egg. Bring to the boil and remove from the fire. Turn 
into a deep heated dish. 

A fricassee of crabs 

Cut the meat into inch-length pieces, and as evenly as possible. 
Put into a saucepan a mixture of butter, lemon juice and minced 
parsley, cayenne and salt. Heat slowly, and when it bubbles stir 
in the crab meat. Simmer gently for fifteen minutes. Have 
ready in another vessel a tablespoonful of cream for each crab, 
heated with a pinch of soda. Thicken with a teaspoonful of but- 
ter rubbed into one of flour, and turn upon the yolks of three 
eggs, or one for every pair of crabs ; stir for one minute over the 
fire, pour into a hot covered dish, stir in the hot crab meat; set 
in boiling water for three minutes, and serve. 

Oyster pate's 

Into a pound of flour chop three-quarters of a pound of cold, 
firm butter, until you have a coarse yellow powder. Have all 
your utensils cold. Wet the flour and butter with three gills 
of iced water and, with a spoon, work into a mass. Turn upon 
a floured pastry board, roll and fold, then roll again three times, 
lightly and quickly. Fold and put in the ice-box for several 
hours. Roll into a sheet half an inch thick, and with a cutter 



FISH 349 

cut into rounds like biscuits. Pile these three deep, and with a 
small cutter pass half-way through each pile. Put into the oven, 
which should be very hot, and bake to a light, delicate brown. 
The pastry should be very light. When done remove from the 
oven, and lift off the little round in the top of each pate. This 
will serve as a cover. With a small spoon scoop out the soft 
paste from the center, thus leaving a cavity to be filled with the 
oyster mixture. 

Cook together a tablespoonful of butter and flour, and pour 
upon them a cupful and a half of rich milk half cream, if you 
have it. Stir to a smooth sauce, add the drained oysters, and cook 
just long enough for the edges to begin to ruffle. Now beat in 
gradually the beaten yolk of an egg ; cook two minutes, season with 
celery salt and white pepper and fill the shells with the mixture. 
Fit on the little covers, and set in the oven until all are very 
hot. 

Oyster fritters 

Chop thirty oysters. Make a batter of two beaten eggs, a half 
pint of milk and a pint of prepared flour. If the batter is too stiff, 
add more milk. Stir the oysters into the batter, and drop this 
by the spoonful into deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. As the 
fritters brown on one side, turn them over. Drain in a hot 
colander as soon as well colored. 

Oyster pie 

Line a deep pie-plate with puff paste, fill the interior with bread 
crusts (to be removed later) and fit on a top crust, buttered about 
the edge on the under side that it may be easily taken off. Stew 
a quart of oysters for five minutes ; stir in very slowly a cupful of 
thick white sauce and the beaten yolks of two eggs. When the 
paste is done take off the top, remove the bread crusts, fill the 
center with the creamed oysters, replace the top crust and set the 
pie in the oven for five minutes before sending to the table. 



350 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Pickled oysters 

Bring a quart of oysters, with their liquor, to the boil ; immedi- 
ately remove the oysters and drop into a large glass jar. To the 
liquor add six whole cloves, six whole pepper-corns, six blades 
of mace broken into bits, a small red pepper, a cupful of vinegar 
and a little celery salt. Boil up once and pour immediately over 
the oysters. Keep in a dark place until wanted. 

Jumbolaya 

(An East Indian recipe.) 

Wash half a cupful of raw rice well and drop into a pint of 
strained tomato juice, made boiling hot. Cook fast for twenty 
minutes, or until the rice is soft, but not broken ; add two table- 
spoonfuls of butter worked to a paste with two teaspoonfuls of 
curry; simmer ten minutes, salt to taste and put in twenty-five 
fine oysters. Cook until they ruffle, and pour out. 

This is a good entree for a family dinner. Pass thin slices of 
buttered graham bread and ice-cold bananas with it. 

Clam pie 

Fry a quarter pound of fat salt pork crisp ; strain out the scraps 
and fry a sliced onion in the same fat. Strain again, add a pint 
of clam juice with a lump of butter the size of an egg, and make 
hot while you prepare the "pie." 

In the bottom of a buttered bakedish put a layer of clams, on 
them one of milk crackers, previously soaked in hot milk, but- 
tered, peppered and salted, more clams and so on until the dish 
is nearly full. Cover the last stratum of clams with parboiled 
potatoes cut very thin, pepper and salt, and sprinkle these with a 
tablespoonful of grated onion and the same of parsley. Now 
pour the hot liquor over all, cover with a good pie crust and bake 
half an hour in a good oven, covered, then brown. 



FISH 351 

Clam cocktails 

Put a dozen small clams in an ice-cold bowl and pour over 
them a half tablespoonful, each, of Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, 
lemon juice and tomato catsup, a teaspoonful of horseradish and 
a saltspoonful, each, of salt and Tabasco sauce. Mix and bury 
in ice for an hour before serving in two small glasses. 

Oysters with Parmesan cheese 

(Contributed) 

Drain the oysters free from all liquor. Lay in a well-buttered 
baking-dish, sprinkle over with finely-minced parsley, season with 
salt and pepper; over all pour one-half glass of champagne 
and cover thickly with grated Parmesan cheese. Put in the oven 
until nicely browned on top. Take out; drain all the fat from 
it, and serve while very hot in the dish in which it was baked. 

Oyster cutlets 
(Contributed) 

Drain off the liquor and wash the oysters well. Put them into 
a saucepan over the fire and heat until the edges curl, being care- 
ful to stir all the time. Strain the liquor. Chop the oysters fine. 
Rub together one tablespoonful of butter and one rounded table- 
spoonful of flour for each pint of chopped oysters. Add the oys- 
ter liquor and cook until quite thick. Then add the chopped oys- 
ters and the yolk of one egg, beaten well. After taking from the 
fire add one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of minced 
parsley and the juice of one-half a lemon. Let all stand until per- 
fectly cold. Form into cutlets, dip into egg, then into bread- 
crumbs and fry in hot fat. 

Oyster canapes

FAMILIAR TALK 

IS IMPKOMPTU HOSPITALITY A LOST ART 

WITHOUT staying to prove my premises I take it for granted 
nobody will dispute that what it pleases me to call impromptu 
hospitality is an out-of-date virtue. 

In the very olden time there were those who were backward in 
the practice of it. Else the fisherman Apostle would not have 
enjoined upon the "strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Gala- 
tia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia," to "use hospitality, one to 
another, without grudging." 

An ancient writer says : "The primitive Christians made one 
principal part of their duty to consist in the exercise of hospital- 
ity; and they were so exact in the practice of it that the very 
heathens admired them for it." 

From which we gather that the Apostolic admonition had fallen 
into good soil and brought forth much fruit. 

It would be interesting to know when the quid pro quo ele- 
ment entered into and denied the noble virtue. The primitive 
Christians aforesaid had no knowledge of this alloy, while the 
recollection of the Master's teaching was fresh in their minds : 

"For if ye lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what 
thank have ye ?" 

The principle that moves me to invite those to sit at my table 
and sleep under my roof who can return the favor in kind, or be 
useful in turn to me in some way, is barter, not hospitality. 
When I give a feast be it afternoon tea, or the gravest of social 
functions, a dinner party to five hundred, or to five people who 
have invited me at some time to their houses and because of the 
obligation under which their invitations have laid me I may be 
honest. I am not generous. I pay a debt. I do not exercise a 
grace. 

361 



362 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

The former times were not better in all respects than these. 
But for divers reasons they were more hospitable times. It was 
inevitable that private houses should keep open doors when tav- 
erns, and even houses of entertainment, were few and far apart 
upon main-traveled roads, and utterly wanting to the traveler 
who pushed his way into the back country unknown except to the 
pioneer. If the stranger were not welcomed to the home of him 
whose house stood nearest to the wayside, he was shelterless in 
night or storm. There is the less need for the exercise of undis- 
criminating hospitality when inn and hotel "blaze" the track into 
the wilderness. 

There is none the less occasion for asking our friends to enter 
our homes and to partake of the food which is a symbol of the 
good-will we have for them, our disposition to share with them the 
best blessings granted to man in this world home loves and home 
joys. True hospitality but widens the circle and makes the guest 
"at home." Artificial hospitality seeks or accepts a convenient 
season for making the everyday life of the home seem what it is 
not to the stranger within our gates. 

Our forbears said : "Come in and take pot-luck with us." 

An old Virginian told me that, as a boy, he was a visitor in a 
country house in the central part of the state, when a carriage 
drove up to the gate, and James Madison, then president of the 
United States, alighted. The lady of the manor was sitting upon 
the front porch, a bit of needle-work in band. She arose, cordial 
and dignified, to receive her guest. As her chief butler, a far 
more consequential personage than his mistress, bustled out with 
a footman or two at his heels to see what could be done for the 
distinguished arrival, she said to him in a gentle "aside," audible 
to the boy visitor : "James ! see that a plate is put upon the table 
for Mr. Madison." 

Southern hospitality was a proverb then and for many a year 
thereafter. In her book, "The Voice of the People," Miss Glas- 
gow tells a story, which I can certify is not exaggerated, of an old 
aunt who came to her nephew's house on a visit of a week and 
stayed twenty years, guarded by the viewless, but potent, aegis 
of hospitality. A plate was put upon the table for the poor rela- 



FAMILIAR TALK 363 

tion in town and country house in that lavish land, as freely as for 
the chief magistrate, and was filled as bountifully. 

When relative, acquaintance or stranger tarried but a night, 
the householder, in the homely speech of his fathers, asked in 
gentle sarcasm, "if he had come for a chunk of fire ?" 

In his father's day, lucifer matches were unknown. When the 
fire went out upon the kitchen hearth of plantation or cabin, a 
swift runner was sent across fields to borrow a live brand from 
the nearest neighbor. He must hurry back before it went out. 

We invite people to come to us at a stated time and for a given 
period. When the time is up, we tell them graciously that we 
have enjoyed their visit, and hope we shall meet again before long. 
When the carriage that takes them to the station is out of sight, 
we say, "That is well over !" and make a note to that effect in our 
visiting book. 

Leaving the general view of our subject for individual illus- 
tration : 

If satirists and grumbling wives are to be believed, a husband 
can hardly do a more imprudent thing than to bring home an 
unexpected guest to dinner, or luncheon, or supper. 

The ill-used wife contends that he always does this as if with 
malice aforethought at the most inconvenient times and seasons. 
From her standpoint he might have recollected it seems incredi- 
ble that he could have forgotten that it is washing or ironing 
day, or Thursday, which is the cook's afternoon out, and that 
the housemaid is not equal to a regular dinner. When the mis- 
tress has planned to have a "pick-up" composite of the substan- 
tial meal required by a man after his day's work, and the tea and 
toast which are supposed to meet the temporal needs of the femi- 
nine system the apparition of an impromptu guest, and that 
guest a man, is like a boulder rolled upon the track before the 
domestic engine. The train is derailed, conductor and engineer 
"rattled," and badly shaken up. 

Our housewife has reason on her side, and a good deal of it. 
It is all very fine to say, she urges, that her table should always 
be neat and orderly; that what is nice enough for her husband 
in the way of food and appointments should content the presi- 



364 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

dent, should he chance to drop in. Everybody sings that song 
in the same key, and it is stale bosh! For everybody knows that 
in the best regulated families we do make special provision for 
company. John comprehends that the best china can not be 
used every day, if we would have it remain even "good." The 
second-best is excellent in quality, and pretty. Yet what house- 
keeper is superior to the wish to show outsiders that she has a 
Minton fish set ; Coalport meat dishes and plates ; silver vegetable 
dishes ; Sevres after-dinner coffee-cups ? To set out her table as 
tastefully as she can afford to do is an offering due to the stranger 
within her gates a visible token of hospitable intent. She is, 
in a measure, defrauded in all this when a surprise-visit is sprung 
upon her. 

John is sensible, and does not object to left-overs now and 
then, when flavorously put together. Today's salmi, or salad, or 
croquette is, to him, a reminiscence of yesterday's roast. The 
oyster-stew made by his wife to spare servants wearied by laun- 
dry work, is as satisfactory to him, once in several whiles, as a 
six-course dinner would be. He sees in an Irish stew, supported 
by browned potatoes, hot biscuits, home-made cake and a capital 
cup of coffee, a feast fit for the gods as represented by his hungn 
self and any fellow he may have corralled and brought in to "take 
pot-luck." 

"I ask yer honors if that is anny sort of a shkull to take to 
Donnybrook Fair!" cried an Emeralder who had killed his man 
"in a bit of a foight," when the defense produced the broken 
skull of the deceased in court to prove that the "frontal, parietal 
and occipital segments were extraordinarily thin." 

Mary submits to a jury of her peers if she has not a right to 
be "put about" when Johnry comes marching home serenely with 
a guest in tow, who, for the lack of time to make anything else 
ready, must be set down to left-over oyster, or Irish stew. 

"When a man is asked to dinner, he expects a dinner!" she 
asserts in justifiable vexation. "And when all is said and done, 
the fact remains that one's husband is not a visitor for whom one 
must mind her p's and q's." 

Yet and a "yet" that might fill a whole line if its importance

were considered there is, also, much to be said on John's side. 
Any bachelor can ask the old friend who looks in upon him in 
business hours and places, to lunch or dine with him at a chop 
house or hotel. The guest knows what he would get there. 
Just such a meal as he can buy for dollars and cents at fifty other 
"eating joints" all over the country. A meal, eaten in the pres- 
ence of from twenty to one hundred other feeders, amid the bab- 
ble of voices, the rattle of crockery and the .click of knives and 
forks. 

It is the married man alone who can offer the wayfarer a taste 
and a generous taste of HOME. The dear old fellow thrills 
in every inch of body and soul when he claps an ancient chum on 
the back with 

"Now you must see my wife and babies, old man!" or says to 
a business acquaintance in town for the day: "Mrs. Johannes 
and I would be charmed to have you take a family dinner with 
us. I am just going home now. Come with me !" 

If malcontent Mary but knew it, he pays the highest possible 
compliment to her, as woman and housekeeper, by taking her 
welcome for granted. 

I heard a man say the other day of another : 

"He is a royally good fellow, and, I take it, is happily married. 
He begged me to dine with him when I called at his office, and 
without giving his wife notice. A fellow doesn't take such liber- 
ties with his wife unless he is pretty sure of her and her house- 
keeping. I couldn't accept the invitation, but the impression left 
upon my mind was most agreeable." 

It is worth Mary's while to score a point in her favor with her 
husband's friends and to strengthen her hold upon him by meet- 
ing the unexpected guest with frank cordiality, and in every 
other way making the best of the situation. 

She keeps the house, and has the work and worry that go with 
the keeping. John pays for the material part of the home. How 
much it signifies to him the best of wives does not always know. 
It is his stimulus, his hope, his sheet anchor, when all the waves 
and billows of business trouble go over his soul his haven of 



366 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

refuge the nearest approach to Heaven he can find on this side 
of the dark river. He has a lien in legal phrase upon all the 
benefits accruing therefrom. 

The exercise of spontaneous hospitality is not the least of these. 



MEATS 

BEEF 

Boast beef 

NEVER wash a raw roast, at least not the parts unprotected by 
the thin skin. Wipe the skin off with vinegar, dry with a soft 
cloth, and lay the meat, cut sides at top and bottom, upon the 
grating of your roaster. Dash a cupful of really boiling water 
over it. They cicatrice the surface and keep in the juices. 
Dredge with flour, cover and cook ten minutes to the pound, turn- 
ing all the heat into the oven for fifteen minutes ; then shift into 
a slower oven, or "dampen" the fire. Baste every ten minutes 
with the gravy dripping into the pan. Ten minutes before dish- 
ing the meat, wash freely with butter and dredge with browned 
flour, to "glaze" the roast. 

Never serve "made gravy" with roast beef. Pour the liquid 
from the pan into a bowl, and when the fat is solid, remove it 
and clarify for dripping. The residuum will add richness to your 
soup-stock, or make a savory base for stew or hash. 

Serve horseradish sauce and mustard with your rare roast, 
and put a little of the ruddy juice which exudes as the meat is 
carved, upon each slice when served. 

Boast beef with Yorkshire pudding 

Fifteen minutes before taking up the roast just described, skim 
six tablespoonfuls of fat from the gravy, put into a smaller drip- 
ping-pan, or pudding-dish, and set in the oven. Have ready this 
batter : 

Sift an even teaspoonful of salt and one of baking-powder 

367 



368 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

twice with a pint of flour. Beat two eggs light, add to them two 
cupfuls of milk, turn in the sifted flour and mix quickly. Set 
the reserved fat upon the upper grating of the oven ; when it be- 
gins to bubble, turn in the batter, and cook quickly to a fine, 
golden-brown. Cut into squares and garnish the meat with them 
when you dish it. 

This is a better way than cooking the pudding in the roaster 
under the meat, as used to be the custom with English cooks. 

Eechauffe of beef a la jardiniere 

Lay yesterday's piece of beef in a roasting-pan, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and cover it with thick slices of raw tomatoes. 
Dash a cupful of boiling water over all, put a close cover on the 
roaster, and cook in a hot oven for thirty-five minutes. While 
this is cooking boil tender a pint of green peas, a pint of pota- 
toes cut into tiny squares three carrots, also cut small, and ten 
small onions. Season each vegetable with pepper, salt, and a 
small bit of butter. 

Lay the beef with the tomatoes upon it on a hot platter, pour 
over it any gravy remaining in the pan, and arrange neatly about 
it the other vegetables. Be sure that meat and vegetables are 
very hot when served. 

Braised beef 

Put a nice round of beef in a broad-bottomed iron pot with 
a tablespoonful of butter, and sprinkle a chopped onion over it. 
Cook the beef on one side until brown, then turn and cook on the 
other side for the same length of time. Now dash a pint of boil- 
ing water over the meat, put a close cover on the pot and let the 
contents cook slowly, allowing at least fifteen minutes to every 
pound of beef. When the meat is done, remove from the pot to 
a platter and keep warm while you strain the gravy left in the 
pot; return to the fire and thicken it with a tablespoonful of 
browned flour rubbed into the same quantity of butter. Season 
the gravy with salt, pepper, and a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, 
and pour it over the meat. 



MEATS 369 

Rib-ends of beef 

These are usually cut off when the roast is rolled, and can be 
bought cheap. 

Fry in beef fat a sliced onion and a chopped sweet pepper . 
carefully seeded. Take these up with a skimmer and keep hot. 
Pepper, salt and flour the rib-ends and fry in the same fat until 
they begin to brown. Put, now, with the fat into a saucepan, 
strew the fried onion and pepper on top; pour in a cup of weak 
stock; fit on a close cover, and cook very slowly until the beef 
is tender. 

Strain and skim the gravy, thicken with browned flour; add 
a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet; arrange the beef-bones in a 
dish ; pour the gravy over them and serve. 

Pot-roast of coarse beef 

Cut four pounds of coarse lean beef in one piece. Fry half a 
pound of fat salt pork in a rather shallow pot. Put in the beef, 
and cook fast on both sides for five minutes. , Cover with a 
chopped onion and a cupful of canned tomatoes, a sliced carrot 
and a sliced turnip. Now, pour in enough hot water to come half- 
way to the top of the meat ; cover closely and simmer slowly for 
two hours, turning at the end of the first hour. 

Take out the beef; rub with butter, pepper and salt, and set 
in the oven while you skim and strain the gravy, rubbing the 
vegetabfes with it through a colander. Put this back into the pot, 
thicken with browned flour, boil up once ; pour half over the meat 
and serve the rest in a gravy-boat. 

Boiled boiled beef 

(An English recipe) 

Cut an oblong piece of beef from the flank. It should be two 
inches thick, twelve inches long and six wide. Lay it on a dish 
and spread upon it this forcemeat : 

24 



370 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

A cupful of cracker crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of finely- 
chopped salt pork, half a teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful, each, 
of thyme, marjoram, and sage, half a saltspoonful of pepper, a few 
drops of onion juice, or one teaspoonful of chopped onion, and 
one egg. Moisten with a good stock until soft enough to spread 
over the meat. 

Roll as you would a valise pudding, tie about with pack-thread 
and sew up in mosquito netting or cheese-cloth. Put on in plenty 
of boiling water and cook slowly for four hours. Let it lie in the 
water until the latter is a little more than lukewarm, and put 
under a heavy weight until next day. Remove the cloth, cut the 
strings and serve cold with horseradish sauce. 

Corned beef is very good prepared in this way. Add vinegar 
to the water in which it is boiled and omit the pork from the 
stuffing. 

Beef a la mode (No. 1) 

Cut two pounds of lean beef from the round into strips. Cover 
the bottom of a pudding-dish with thin strips of bacon, then put 
in half the meat and strew over this carrots, turnips and onions, 
sliced very thin. There should be four of these, part of them go- 
ing over the first layer of beef, the remainder over the second 
layer of beef. With them go two bay-leaves broken into bits. 
Cover all with stock, make a paste of flour and water, rolling it 
out as for pie crust, cover the top of the bake-dish with this, 
pinching it down about the edges so that no steam may escape. 
Bake for two hours in a steady oven, remove the paste cover, and 
send the dish at once to the table. 

Beef a la mode (No. 2) 

Have a solid piece cut from the round, and tie into shape with 
stout cords at intervals of an inch apart. Plug the meat perpen- 
dicularly with strips of fat salt pork, long enough to project half 
an inch at top and bottom. Make incisions clear through the 
beef with a sharp, thin knife, and fill these with forcemeat made 
of fat pork, minced, onion and bread-crumbs, sharply seasoned. 



MEATS 371 

Lay the meat in a braising-pot, cover deep with chopped onion, 
carrot, turnip, celery, three bay-leaves, a sliced tomato, and 
sprinkle with mace and paprika. Now pour in a cupful of cold 
water, cover closely and cook slowly fifteen minutes to the pound. 

If you wish to serve hot, clip the threads ; rub the gravy 
through a colander, let it cool a few minutes to throw up the fat ; 
skim and thicken with browned flour, and pour half over the meat, 
half into a gravy-boat. 

It is, however, nicer if left to get cold in the gravy, with a 
heavy weight on top, until next day. Then remove the cords, 
and cut in thin, horizontal slices. 

An underdone roast can be metamorphosed in this way for a 
second-day's dinner. 

Braised rolled beefsteak 

This is a good way of dealing with a hopelessly tough steak. 
Lay upon a board and pound from end to end with a mallet. 
Cover with a forcemeat of minced salt pork, onion and seasoned 
crumbs, wet with a little gravy; roll up upon the stuffing and 
tie into shape. Lay in your roaster; pour in a little cold water 
(or, better still, weak stock), cover and cook slowly for two 
hours, basting often with gravy from the pan. Undo the strings 
carefully, after pinning the roll together with skewers, and lay 
upon a hot dish, covered, while you prepare the gravy. Skim, 
thicken with browned flour, add a good spoonful of kitchen bou- 
quet, boil up and pour into a boat. 

Baked beefsteak a la jardiniere 

Still another way of making a tough steak eatable. Pound it 
on both sides and lay in lemon juice and salad oil for two hours. 
Transfer then to your roaster, cover with two sliced tomatoes, 
a sliced carrot, an onion and a turnip, with minced sweet herbs. 
Add a cupful of cold water, cover closely and cook slowly twenty 
minutes to the pound. 

Cut one large carrot, two large onions, two turnips and four 
stalks of celery into neat dice and cook them soft, without break- 



372 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ing, in salted water, each in a pan of its own. In another sauce- 
pan cook four large tomatoes, peeled -and whole. 

When the steak is done, keep hot over boiling water, while 
you rub the vegetables with which it was cooked through the 
colander or a vegetable press back into the gravy, thickening this 
with browned flour. Boil one minute, add the juice of a lemon 
and a glass of sherry, and keep hot in a closed vessel. Dish the 
meat, lay the vegetable dice about it in little heaps, each kind by 
itself, leaving the tomatoes whole; pour the rich gravy over all; 
cover the dish and leave in the open oven for three minutes to 
let the gravy soak in. 

You have now a "French dish," that will amply repay the ad- 
ditional pains it has cost you. 

A family pot-roast of beef 

The round will serve for this dish. Fry slices of fat salt pork 
in an iron pot, and when crisp, remove and throw in a sliced 
onion. When this is browned, remove and lay the roast in the 
pot. Cook for ten minutes, turn and cook for five minutes more. 
Now, add a cupful of water, cover closely and simmer over a slow 
fire for an hour. Add a sliced carrot, two teaspoonfuls of lemon 
juice, a bay-leaf and a tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce to 
the contents of the pot. Turn the beef over and over in this, and 
if the meat seem dry add a cupful of water, or, better still, stock. 
Cook covered, very slowly, for two hours more. Transfer the 
meat to a hot platter, thicken the gravy left in the pot with a 
brown roux, salt and pepper to taste, and stir in two tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar. Pour this sauce over the meat and send to 
the table. 

A New England pot-roast 

Lay a round of beef in a broad, deep pot. Pour in a cupful of 
boiling water, add two slices of onion, cover closely and cook 
gently ten minutes to the pound. Transfer to a dripping-pan, 
rub with butter, dredge with flour, and brown in a quick oven. 
Strain and cool the gravy left in the pot, take off the fat, put the 



MEATS 373 

gravy into a saucepan, season with pepper, salt and a little kitchen 
bouquet, and thicken with a heaping tablespoonful of brown roux. 
Boil up once and serve in a gravy-boat, or pour around the base 
of the beef. 

Savory ragout of beef 

Cut a round beefsteak into inch-squares. Fry minced salt pork 
in a pan until you have enough fat to fry the meat, then remove 
the bits of pork and lay in the meat, each piece of which must 
first be rolled in flour. When the meat is brown at the edges, 
add to the fat two tablespoonfuls of flour that has been lightly 
browned, stir in a pint of weak stock, or, if you have not that, 
of boiling water ; stir to a brown sauce, and return the meat to it, 
throwing in, at the same time, a minced onion. Leave the meat 
at the side of the range where it will cook very slowly for three- 
quarters of an hour. Now, season to taste with salt, add a bay 
leaf and a little kitchen bouquet. A little Worcestershire sauce 
is thought by some to be an improvement. Cover again and cook, 
still slowly, for over an hour, or until the meat is very tender. 
Stir in two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and turn out upon a heated 
platter. 

Beef hot pot 

Two pounds of beef ribs ; one tablespoonful of dripping ; two 
chopped onions and six tiny green peppers, four slices of toast, 
a little black pepper, chives, vinegar, thyme, raisins, olives, toma- 
toes to taste, all minced. 

Heat the dripping in a saucepan, put into it the ingredients 
(leave the peppers whole, and mince the chives), cover closely 
and stew until boiled to rags. Thicken with butter rolled in 
browned flour. Serve on toast. 

Boiled beef tongue (smoked) 

Wash the tongue well and soak four hours in tepid water. 
Put over the fire in plenty of cold water and cook twelve minutes 
to the pound after the boil begins. Let it get cold in the water ; 
pare and trim neatly, and garnish with small green pickles. 



374 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Braised fresh beef's tongue (No. 1) 

Wash the tongue and boil for half an hour. Trim away the 
root and the tough edges. 

Fry a sliced onion in three tablespoonfuls of dripping. Strain 
out the onion and lay the tongue in the frying-pan. Cook ten 
minutes, turning twice. Remove to your covered roaster; lay 
upon the grating and dredge with flour. Pour the fat over it; 
add a large cupful of boiling water and cook, closely covered, for 
an hour and a half, basting four times. 

Take up and keep hot over boiling water while you skim off 
the fat, and thicken with browned flour. Season with paprika, 
onion juice, salt and half a cupful of strained tomato sauce. 

Dish the tongue and pour the gravy over it. Send around 
horseradish sauce with it. 

Sauce for braised tongue 

Cook tog-ether in a saucepan a tablespoonful, each, of butter 
and flour until they bubble. Into a half-pint cup put a couple of 
teaspoonfuls of vinegar, fill up the cup with boiling water, and 
turn this on the butter and flour. Stir until thick and smooth. 
Just before taking from the fire stir in a tablespoonful of grated 
horseradish. Let it get hot, and serve. 

t 
Braised fresh tongue (No. 2) 

Clean, and boil for an hour, leaving in the water for fifteen 
minutes after taking it from the fire. Trim neatly. Skewer the 
tip and root of the tongue together and lay in your covered 
roaster upon a layer of sliced onion, carrot, celery, tomatoes, and 
minced parsley. Cover with the same ; add a cupful of the water 
in which the tongue was boiled, fit on your cover and cook slowly 
for two hours. Dish the tongue and keep hot. Rub gravy and 
vegetables through the colander, into a saucepan ; thicken with 
browned flour. Lay the tongue in a bake-pan ; pour the gravy 
over it, and set upon the top grating of an oven to brown. Dish, 



MEATS 375 

pour the gravy about the tongue and serve. Eat mushroom sauce 
with it. 

Mushroom sauce for the above 

Wash the mushrooms, wipe and peel them, then cut into tiny 
dice. Stir in a little of the gravy from the tongue ; season with 
salt and paprika; add a lump of butter rolled in browned flour 
and cook two minutes. 

A little lemon juice improves the flavor. 

An Italian entree of beef's tongue 

This is a good way to warm up the remains of a boiled or 
roast fresh tongue. Slice, cover with oil and lemon-juice, and 
leave in the marinade for one hour. Then add salt, pepper, some 
sliced onion, a little parsley and a few mushrooms cut into halves. 
Place in a frying-pan and cook slowly for about fifteen minutes, 
moistening with a tablespoonful of sherry and a little lemon juice ; 
just before taking from the fire add a little brown stock, and a 
little tomato sauce, well-seasoned. 

Boiled beefs tongue 

Wash well and cook in salted, boiling water until a steel skewer 
goes easily into the thickest part. Leave in the water for fifteen 
minutes, trim, and lay on a hot dish. Pour sauce tartare over it 
and send more around with it. 

Boiled beef's heart 

Wash the heart and soak for half an hour in cold, salted water, 
Wipe and stuff the ventricles with a forcemeat of bread-crumbs 
and chopped ham or salt pork, minced fine and well seasoned. 
Sew up in cheese-cloth fitted to the heart, and bring slowly to a 
boil in salted water, to which a tablespoon of vinegar has been 
added. Boil gently two hours, turning the heart several times. 

Remove the cloth and dish the heart. Pour a piquante sauce 
over it. 



376 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

The heart is made more savory if you will boil it in weak stock 
instead of water. 

Boast beef's heart 

Prepare as directed in last recipe, but roast instead of boiling, 
laying the heart upon a bed of minced onion and tomatoes, and 
pouring in a little hot water to make the gravy. Rub this through 
a colander, thicken with browned flour, season to taste and pour 
over the heart. 

How to corn beef 

Mix salt with saltpeter in the proportion of ten parts of the 
first to one of the second, and with this rub the piece of beef to 
be corned until the salt lies dry upon the surface. Let it stand 
in a cold place for twenty-four hours and repeat the process, and 
the next day put it into pickle. This is made by boiling together 
for ten minutes a gallon of salt, four ounces of saltpeter, and a 
pound and a half of brown sugar in five gallons of water. The 
meat should not be put into the pickle until the latter is perfectly 
cold. Leave it in the pickle and take it out as needed, looking 
after it once in a while to see if it is keeping well. If not, take 
the meat out, rub it well with dry salt, and prepare a fresh and 
stronger brine. 

How to corn a tongue 

Put into a saucepan a gallon and a half of water, a half-pound 
of brown sugar, two and a quarter ounces of salt and a half- 
ounce of saltpeter. Boil for half an hour, skim and, when cold, 
pour over the tongue. 

It should be ready for use in a week. 

Boiled corned beef 

Soak for an hour in cold water. Put over the fire in plenty of 
cold water. Put into the pot with it a peeled carrot and a small 
onion, and for a gallon of water a tablespoonful of vinegar. 
Cook slowly, allowing twenty-five minutes to the pound if very 



MEATS 377 

salt, or if the meat has lain in the brine for some weeks. Let it 
lie in the liquor for half an hour after it is done. Lift it then, 
trim away ragged edges, lay on a hot dish and wash all over with 
butter in which has been beaten the juice of half a lemon. 

Strain a cupful of the liquor ; stir into it a tablespoonful of but- 
ter rolled in one of flour, boil two minutes and add a great spoon- 
ful of minced pickles, or of capers. Some like to use pickled 
onions for this purpose. 

Send around horseradish and mustard with it. 

When it leaves the table put a plate with a heavy weight upon 
it, and leave thus all night. 



VEAL 



Boast leg 1 of veal 

Wipe a leg of veal with a damp cloth and place it in a covered 
roaster. Dash a cupful of boiling water over the meat, cover it 
closely and cook at the rate of twenty minutes to the pound. 
Half an hour before the meat is taken from the oven remove the 
cover from the roaster, baste the meat with the gravy in the pan, 
and brown. 

Shoulder of veal 

This may be roasted, like the leg, but is better for having the 
bone removed, and the cavity thus left filled with a forcemeat 
made of bread-crumbs and chopped ham, seasoned to taste. 

Veal cutlets 

Wipe the cutlets with a damp cloth, dip them, first, in beaten 
egg, then in cracker dust, and set in a cold place for an hour. 
Fry in dripping to a rich brown. Cook slowly that they may be 
thoroughly done. Lay for a moment on brown paper to drain 
free of grease, and put on a hot platter. Serve with tomato 
sauce. 



378 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Veal steaks with mushroom sauce 

Broil the steaks slowly over a clear fire, turning often that 
they may not scorch. When done, keep the meat hot on a platter 
in the oven while you make the following sauce : 

Drain the liquor from a can of mushrooms and cut the mush- 
rooms in halves. Cook together a tablespoonful of butter and 
one of browned flour until they are dark brown in color. Pour 
upon them the mushroom liquor and a cupful of beef stock. Stir 
to a smooth sauce, season with a dash of Worcestershire sauce, 
salt and pepper, and add the halved mushrooms. Cook for two 
minutes, stirring constantly, then pour over and around the veal 
steaks. 

Breast of veal a la jardiniere 

Lard with strips of fat salt pork, and sprinkle with paprika. 
Dredge with flour and lay upon the grating of your covered 
roaster, add enough boiling water to cover it barely, and roast 
for an hour, basting with the gravy every ten or fifteen minutes. 
Then turn on the other side and spread over the roast a pint of 
tomatoes peeled and sliced, two onions, chopped fine, two sprigs 
of parsley, chopped fine, and two chopped peppers. Baste for 
another hour every ten minutes. When the meat is removed 
keep hot while you take up the vegetables with a split spoon, 
and keep them hot also. Strain the gravy, thicken with browned 
flour, and put into a boat. Lay the vegetables about the meat 
upon a metal or fire-proof dish, dredge this last with browned 
crumbs, and dot with softened butter. Set upon the top grating 
of the oven for five minutes to brown and send to table in the dish. 



Stuffed roast fillet of veal 

Take out the central bone and skewer the fillet into a neat 
round. Make a forcemeat of crumbs, minced pork, onion juice, 
parsley and half a can of mushrooms, minced. Wet with a few 
spoonfuls of stock or gravy ; fill the bone-hole and ram the stuf- 
fing into the folds of the meat from both sides. Lay on your 



MEATS 379 

1 roaster, cover with very thin slices of fat salt pork, 
sh a cupful of boiling water over top and sides. Roast, 
i, twelve minutes to the pound. Fifteen minutes before 
aw it from the oven remove the pork, wash with butter and 

with browned flour. Then brown, uncovered. 

fillet should be basted four times while roasting. After 
irth basting draw off a cupful of gravy from the dripping- 
it on ice, or in cold water until the fat rises, skim, add four 
)oonfuls of strained tomato juice, thicken with browned 
and cook three minutes before pouring into a gravy-boat. 

Boast breast of veal 

Cook as you would the fillet, running a sharp knife between 
ribs and meat to make space for the stuffing. 
Serve spinach with it. 

Breaded veal cutlets 

Roll the cutlets in fine crumbs, salted and peppered; dip 
into beaten egg, then again in crumbs. Set on ice for an hour 
to get firm, and fry in deep fat, turning three times, carefully. 
Cook slowly after the first five minutes. Underdone veal is un- 
wholesome and unpalatable. 

Drain off the fat, and serve in a heated dish. Send around 
horseradish or tomato sauce with them, and accompany with 
spinach. 

Mock squabs 

Have six or eight slices cut from a loin of veal, half an inch 
thick, about seven inches long and four wide. Make a force- 
meat of crumbs, fat pork, and minced mushrooms seasoned with 
paprica, onion juice and a little lemon juice with a suspicion of 
grated lemon-peel. Moisten with a beaten egg and cover with 
this each slice of meat nearly to the edge, roll up tightly and tie 
with twine, or fasten with wooden skewers. Dredge with salt, 
pepper and flour, roast them as previously directed, golden-brown. 
Be very careful that they do not brown or become too highly 



380 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

colored. When nearly done add cream to almost cover and let 
them simmer about fifteen minutes or until quite tender. Re- 
move the strings, arrange the "squabs" on toast, garnish with 
water-cress, and pour a little of the strained cream over each. 
Serve with asparagus or spinach. 

larded veal 

Have a solid piece cut from the thickest part of the shoulder. 
Lard at short intervals with strips of fat salt pork and put into 
your* covered roaster with sliced carrot, onion, bits of celery and 
a few sprigs of parsley; over all pour a large cupful of good 
stock, cover and cook slowly for about three hours. You should 
baste frequently while cooking, and a short time before it is done 
remove the cover, to cook the larding thoroughly and give a good 
color to the veal. 

Just before taking up pour out a cupful of gravy, skim off the 
fat and thicken with browned flour, add a great spoonful of to- 
mato catsup, and simmer until you are ready to dish the meat. 
Pour then into a boat. 

Boast calves' hearts 

You will need two hearts for a dish of moderate size. Wash 
them thoroughly, leaving in salt and water for an hour, to draw 
out the blood. Run a slender, keen knife from the large end of 
each heart straight to the center, turning it around several times 
to make a central hole for the forcemeat stuffing. Make this of 
cracker crumbs highly seasoned with onion juice, salt and pep- 
per, thyme or marjoram. Moisten with melted butter, or use 
hot water and a little fat pork or bacon finely chopped. Sew 
the opening together, and thrust in several lardoons of salt pork. 
Dredge with salt, pepper and flour. Fry one sliced onion in 
dripping in a frying-pan. Put in the heart and brown it lightly 
all over. Pour in stock to cover it barely add a bay leaf, two 
slices of carrot and one teaspoonful of salt. Cover the pan and 
cook in a moderate oven about two hours, or until very tender. 

When done remove the strings, put the hearts upon a hot dish,

and thicken the gravy with browned flour. Add lemon juice 
and other seasoning if needed. Strain over the hearts. Garnish 
with Parisian potatoes alternately with small tomatoes, pared 
and baked. Pour melted butter and minced parsley over potatoes 
and tomatoes. 

Larded liver 

Wash a calf's or lamb's liver, lard i': with narrow strips of salt 
pork, and put it into a covered roaster. Pour over the liver a 
pint of cold beef stock and cover the pan closely. Set in a mod- 
erate oven and cook an hour and a half. Transfer the liver to 
a deep dish and put the pan containing the gravy on the top of 
the range. Thicken the gravy with a heaping tablespoonful of 
browned flour and add to it a cupful of strained tomato liquor, 
a teaspoonful of onion juice, salt and pepper to taste. Boil up 
once and pour over the liver. 

Salmi of liver 

Boil a calf's liver for one hour in slightly salted water, and 
let it get cold. Cut into dice of uniform size, and for each cupful 
allow one tablespoonful of butter, one cupful of stock, one tea- 
spoonful of tomato sauce, and two tablespoonfuls of chopped 
olives. Brown the butter, add one tablespoonful of flour and 
brown again ; add gradually the stock, and stir until smooth and 
thick. Put in the catsup, olives and liver dice, season to taste, and 
simmer for fifteen minutes. Serve hot. 

A delightful and not inelegant entree. 

Roast sweetbreads 

Parboil two pairs of sweetbreads and blanch by throwing them 
into cold water. Drain, pierce three or four holes in each and 
press into these holes narrow strips of fat salt pork, allowing the 
strips to project a half-inch on each side. Lay the sweetbreads 
in a roasting-pan, pour a cupful of weak veal stock over them 
and rub them with melted butter. Cover and bake for twenty- 



382 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

five minutes; remove from the pan, sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per, put a spoonful of the thickened and seasoned gravy upon 
each, and send to the table. 

Baked calf's head 

The head should be cleaned with the skin left on, also the ears, 
and split down the under side, leaving the top unbroken. Re- 
move the tongue and brains, parboil and set them on ice. Put the 
head on in plenty of cold water, boil quickly and for one minute 
after the boiling point is reached. Take the head off and lay in 
ice-cold water. Change this for colder in ten minutes, and leave 
in this for several hours. 

Then put over the fire in boiling water, to which a tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar has been added, and a tablespoonful of salt. Cook 
gently until you can slip out the bones easily. 

Do this, drawing the teeth, cheek-bones and skull, taking care 
not to break the upper skin. Put into a bake-dish, restoring the 
shape as well as you can. Cut the tongue into slices and lay 
close against the cheeks ; wash plentifully with butter rubbed 
to a cream with lemon juice, sift dry crumbs all over it and bake, 
covered, half an hour. Then brown. 

To make the gravy, rub the brains to a soft paste ; pepper and 
salt, season with tomato catsup and onion juice, add enough of 
the liquor in which the head was boiled to make a boatful of 
gravy, thicken with butter rolled in flour, simmer five minutes 
and serve. 

There is no more savory preparation of calf's head than this. 
It goes to table in the bake-dish. The liquor from the pot in 
which it had the second boiling makes excellent soup stock. 

Boiled calf's head 

Boil as directed in last recipe, but do not blanch or bone. When 
it has been cooked tender, dish, with the tongue (which should 
have been boiled with it), sliced and laid against the cheeks, and 
pour over it a brain gravy, made as for the baked head, with the 
addition of a great spoonful of minced olives. 



MEATS 383 

Mock turtle 

Boil and blanch a calf's head, take out the bones and let the 
meat and tongue get cold in the liquor. Do not let it remain 
long enough to jelly. As soon as the meat is firm take it from 
the stock, wipe dry, and cut with the tongue into neat dice an 
inch long, and half as wide. Make a gravy of a large cupful of 
the pot liquor, thickened with butter rolled in browned flour and 
seasoned with lemon and onion juice, a teaspoonful of kitchen 
bouquet, a little salt and paprika. Put in the meat, and simmer 
fifteen minutes. 

Have ready a sauce made by heating a cupful of cream (add- 
ing a pinch of soda) and pour it, stirring all the time, upon the 
beaten yolks of three eggs. Stir and beat for one minute, and 
add to the meat and gravy. Now add a glass of sherry and pour 
all into a deep dish, in which you have laid a pile of turtle eggs 
made by rubbing together the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs 
and the boiled brains of the calf, binding them with a raw egg and 
a little browned flour. They should be made into little marbles 
with floured hands and cooked in boiling butter for two min- 
utes, then fished out and drained in a colander. 

A delicious entree! 

Calf's liver a la jardiniere 

Lard a large liver with strips of fat salt pork. Cover the bot- 
tom of a large saucepan with a carrot and a young turnip (all 
cut into dice), six very small onions, a handful of green peas and 
the same of string beans cut into short lengths. Lay the liver 
upon these, pepper it and pour in a cupful of stock, or a cupful 
of hot water in which a tablespoonful of butter has been melted. 
Cover closely and cook an hour and a half without opening. In 
a bake-pan cook four peeled tomatoes of medium size. Take up 
the liver and the vegetables, the latter with a split spoon. Lay 
the liver upon a hot dish, group the vegetables (the tomatoes in- 
cluded), each of a kind together, about it; keep hot in the oven 
while you strain the gravy into a saucepan, add a great spoonful 



384 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

of catsup and a tablespoonful of browned flour wet with cold 
water, and cook for one minute. Pour a few spoonfuls over 
liver and vegetables, the rest into a boat. 

Casserole of calf's liver 

Wash and wipe a calf's liver perfectly dry. Fry a few slices 
of fat bacon in a pan until the fat is all fried out. Strain and 
return the fat to the pan, lay in the liver and fry two minutes on 
each side, and then put into the casserole ; add one pint of rich 
brown sauce, a cupful of button onions that have been browned 
in butter and three tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Fasten on the 
cover with a flour and water paste, put in a moderate, steady 
oven, and cook for two hours. Then remove the paste from the 
cover, put in potato balls that have been fried in hot fat, and 
send to the table in the casserole. 

Fried brains for garnishing 

Soak the brains in cold water for an hour, cover with fresh, 
cold water and bring to a boil. Cook for three minutes ; drain, 
and set in a cold place for an hour. Cut in thick slices, sprinkle 
with salt and white pepper; dip in beaten egg, roll in cracker 
dust and set in a cold place long enough for the coating to stiffen. 
Fry in deep cottolene or other fat. 

Scallop of calf's brain 

Soak brains in cold water for an hour, then boil for ten min- 
utes. Drop into iced water, and when very cold cut into tiny 
dice. Butter a pudding dish, put in a layer of the brains, sprinkle 
with pepper, bits of butter and a few drops of onion juice ; then 
put in a thin layer of minced ham. Add more brains, and pro- 
ceed in this way until the dish is full. Sprinkle the top with 
buttered crumbs, pour a cupful of veal stock over all, and bake 
for twenty minutes. 



MEATS 385 

Brain croquettes for garnishing 

Prepare the brains as in the preceding recipe, chop and add to 
them butter, salt and pepper to taste. Into each cupful of the 
mixture stir a tablespoonful of crumbs and moisten all with 
cream. Heat in a double boiler, and when the boiling point is 
reached whip in slowly a beaten egg, and remove the mixture 
from the fire. Turn upon a dish to cool and stiffen before form- 
ing into small croquettes. Crumb these and set on the ice for 
two hours. Fry in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. 

Any dish of liver or calf's head in fact of veal in any form 
is made elegant by a garnish of brains, fried as croquettes, or in 
slices. 

MUTTON 

Roast leg of mutton with sorrel sauce 

Wipe a leg of young mutton with a damp cloth, then with a 
dry. Put into a covered roaster, dash a cupful of boiling water 
over it and roast at the rate of twelve minutes to each pound of 
the meat. Fifteen minutes before serving remove the cover and 
brown. If you do not use a covered roaster baste the meat every 
fifteen minutes, while cooking, with the gravy in the pan. 

Do not send made mutton gravy to the table with it. Pass 
currant jelly with it and such a sauce as this: 

Mince a cupful of field sorrel young and tender and stir 
two tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed into one of browned flour 
into a cupful of boiling water. Add the sorrel, a dash of pap- 
rika and salt. Cook for one minute, take from the fire and beat 
into it, a very little at a time, the well- whipped yolk of an egg. 
Set in boiling water until the mutton is served. It must not cook. 

Boiled leg of mutton 

Carefully trim the meat, cutting off all loose or gristly por- 
tions, and wipe with a damp cloth. Have a kettle of boiling 
water and put in the meat, boiling fast for about ten minutes, 
25 



386 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

when it may simmer until done. Do not put in salt or pepper 
until nearly cooked. Eat with caper sauce. 

The water in which the mutton is boiled makes excellent Scotch 
broth, or plain mutton soup. 

Roast shoulder of mutton 

Carefully remove the bone, or shoulder blade, and fill the 
place with this forcemeat : One cupful of fine bread-crumbs, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of chopped 
onion, salt and pepper to taste, a half-dozen chopped mushrooms 
canned or fresh and melted butter to moisten the mixture. 
Sew up the slit left by the bone, and place in the covered roaster 
with a cupful of water or weak stock. Cook quickly at first, 
basting often, and allowing for cooking about fifteen minutes to 
the pound. Serve with sorrel or other meat sauce, never with 
made gravy. 

Pass string-beans, tomatoes, green peas or young turnips with 
it. 

Stuffed shoulder of lamb 

Have the bone extracted neatly, and fill the cavity left with a 
stuffing of a cupful of bread-crumbs, a dozen raw oysters, 
chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of butter, melted, one table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of onion juice, one- 
half teaspoonful of paprika. Roast in a quick oven. Into two 
tablespoonfuls of softened butter mix one tablespoonful, each, of 
chopped parsley, onion and lemon juice, and kitchen bouquet. 
Draw the meat, when done, from the oven, spread it with this 
prepared sauce, and return to the oven for four minutes. Gar- 
nish with small, round, fried potatoes. 

Send around green peas with it. 

Hotch-potch 

Cut two pounds of lean mutton into neat pieces an inch square. 
Peel and slice six medium-sized potatoes, cut into dice, and par- 
boil for five minutes. Parboil also a dozen small, young onions,

no larger than the end of your thumb. Have a couple of kid- 
neys calf's or lamb's cut into dice, and drain the. liquor from 
fifteen small oysters. Put a layer of meat dice in the dish, then 
a layer of onions, kidneys and potatoes. Season each layer of 
vegetables with pepper and salt. Then another layer of meat, 
onions and kidneys, and the remaining potatoes. Pour on a cup- 
ful of hot water, cover the pan closely and bake it in a moderate 
oven for three hours. Look at it occasionally and add more 
water if it seems dry. 

When nearly ready to serve take up the mixture with a skim- 
mer, arrange it in a deep hot dish. Add the oysters to the gravy 
left in the pan, cook till they ruffle, add more seasoning if needed, 
and pour it over the whole. 

Family stew of lamb and peas 

Cut two pounds of coarse lean lamb into dice. There must be 
neither fat nor bone in it. Fry a sliced onion brown in two table- 
spoonfuls of dripping or butter. Strain the fa.t back into the 
pan, dredge the meat with flour and fry for three minutes in it, 
turning to sear both sides. Turn meat and fat into a saucepan, 
add a cupful of stock or of butter and water, cover closely and 
stew for an hour, or until the lamb is tender. Put in then a cup- 
ful of green peas with three leaves of green mint. Cover again 
and cook until the peas are tender, but not until they break. 
Have ready a broad dish lined with slices of toast soaked in 
tomato sauce. Take up meat and peas in a perforated skimmer 
and lay upon the tbast. Keep hot, while you thicken the gravy 
left in the pot with a tablespoonful of butter rolled in one of 
browned flour ; season, boil up and pour over the stew. Let it 
stand one minute and serve. 

Casserole of lamb chops 

Trim two pounds of lean chops and proceed as with the meat 
in last recipe until they have been browned in the fat. 

Now turn meat and fat into your casserole, in the bottom of 
which is a layer of pared and sliced tomatoes. Have ready half 



388 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

a cupful of potato balls cut with a "gouge" and parboiled for 
five minutes, a dozen button onions, also parboiled, and half a 
can of champignons (mushrooms). Sprinkle these over and be- 
tween the chops. Pour in a cupful of good stock, or gravy, 
well seasoned; lastly, another layer of sliced tomatoes, salted, 
peppered, sprinkled with sugar and dotted with butter. Cover 
the casserole and set in a moderate oven for two hours. 

Drain off all the gravy without disturbing the rest of the con- 
tents of the casserole. Skim, thicken with browned flour, add 
the juice of half a lemon, boil up, pour in a glass of sherry, pour 
gently back into the casserole, cover, set in the oven for three 
minutes and send to table, covered. 

If you once try this recipe you will not be satisfied until the 
dish it represents becomes a frequent visitor to your table. 



MEAT AND POULTRY PIES 

Chicken pie 

Cut at every joint a pair of young chickens. Lay on ice while 
you make a gravy of the pinions, necks and feet scalding and 
skinning the feet before putting with the rest over the fire, cov- 
ering deep with cold water and bringing slowly to the boil. Cook 
until the flesh is in rags, and the liquor reduced by one-half. 
Strain, season highly with onion juice, salt and paprika, thicken 
with browned flour and let the gravy get cole}. 

Meanwhile, arrange your chicken in a bake-dish; lay among 
the pieces either well-seasoned forcemeat balls no larger than 
marbles, made of bread-crumbs and hard-boiled yolks, bound with 
a raw egg, or canned mushrooms. Of course, fresh mushrooms 
are better if you can afford them. Put in a cupful of cold water, 
cover with a good crust, half an inch thick, and bake for an hour 
and a half. Lay a piece of stout paper over the pie to keep it 
from browning too fast. When you remove this at the end of 
an hour draw the pie to the door of the oven, fit a funnel into a 
slit left in the center of the crust and pour in all the gravy it will

hold. Do this very quickly, shut up the oven and leave the pie 
in until done. Remove the paper ten minutes before the time is 
up and brown lightly. 

Cold chicken pie 

Make precisely as in last recipe, but add to the gravy while 
hot a tablespoonful of gelatine soaked for two hours in cold 
water enough to cover it. Pour into the pie as already directed. 
Let the pie get cold before eating it. The gravy will be jellied. 

This is a nice dish for Sunday dinners in hot weather. 



Fowl pie 

Cut an old fowl into joints, splitting the back and dividing the 
breast into quarters. Put over the fire in plenty of cold water, 
season with onion juice and the juice of half a lemon. No salt 
and no pepper. Cover closely and simmer very gently for sev- 
eral hours until you find it tender. Strain off the gravy and 
season with onion juice, celery salt, a bay-leaf, minced parsley, 
paprika and salt. Return the gravy to the fire, stir in a lump of 
butter rolled in browned flour and cook one minute. Arrange 
the chicken in a deep bake-dish, pour in the gravy, lay over the 
top two hard-boiled eggs cut into thin slices, cover with a good 
crust, and bake. 

Chicken pot pies 

For these have several stoneware or other fire-proof deep 
dishes, about the size of a bird bath. Cut up a young fowl into 
joints, cover with cold water and cook tender, but not until the 
meat leaves the bones. Lay a piece of dark meat and one of light 
in each dish; sprinkle with minced salt pork, and drop in each 
dish potato marbles which have been parboiled for ten minutes. 
Add small cubes of pastry, three to each dish, and two small 
young onions, no bigger than the end of your thumb. Unless 
they are mere infants, parboil them five minutes before they go 
in. Have ready two cupfuls of the liquor in which the chicken 
was cooked. Thicken with a lump of butter rolled in browned 



390 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

flour ; season with paprika and minced parsley. The pork should 
salt it sufficiently. Fill the dishes, cover each with a good crust, 
make a slit in the middle and bake, covered with paper, half an 
hour. Then brown. 

You may, if you like, make one dish of this, but many prefer 
the individual "portions." 

Chicken and ham pie 

Cut up and stew the chickens, as in last recipe. Have ready 
four good-sized slices of corned ham (not smoked), boiled and 
cold, and cut into strips. Put a layer of ham in the bottom of a 
buttered bake-dish, season with chopped mushrooms and parsley, 
salt and pepper, and add a layer of white sauce, the base of which 
is the liquor in which the chickens were cooked. Next, place in 
the dish the pieces of chicken in regular order, and upon these 
the yolks of hard-boiled eggs. Repeat the seasoning and the 
sauce, lay a few strips of ham over the top, cover with a good 
paste, wash the pie with beaten egg, and bake for an hour and a 
half. If you have no mushrooms you may substitute a little 
mushroom catsup. 

Veal pie (No, 1) 

Cut three pounds of lean veal into inch-square cubes ; put into 
a saucepan with a cupful of cold water, and heat slowly. Remove 
the scum as it begins to boil; add two small onions, sliced, two 
tablespoonfuls of carrot cubes, and one teaspoonful of salt. Let 
it simmer until very tender. Put the meat then into a deep bak- 
ing-dish. 

Let the liquor boil down to one cupful and a half, strain it and 
remove most of the fat. Add one-half cupful of cream or of rich 
milk, and pepper to taste. Thicken it with a tablespoonful of 
flour rubbed in one of butter ; cook it five minutes, and strain it 
over the meat. If you have any cold boiled ham you may add 
a little of it to the veal, cutting it into tiny pieces. 

Cover with a rich biscuit dough, half an inch thick, and bake 
one hour, covered with thick paper. Uncover and brown. 



MEATS 391 

Veal pie (No. 2) 

Cut two pounds of coarse lean veal into cubes and cook tender 
in enough cold water to cover it. Have ready half a pound of 
finely-minced pork, an onion, chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of 
finely-minced olives, a stalk of celery cut fine, and a tablespoonful 
of chopped parsley. Put a stratum of veal in the bottom of a but- 
tered bake-dish ; cover with this mixture and sprinkle with pa- 
prika and with butter. When all the materials are used up in 
this order fill the dish with gravy made by thickening the liquor in 
which the veal was stewed with browned flour, adding a table- 
spoonful of tomato catsup, and boiling one minute. Cover with a 
good crust ; make a slit in the top and bake, covered, one hour ; 
then brown. 

Beef and tomato pie 

Cut a pint of cold roast beef into small dice of uniform size, 
and mix with it two or three slices of bacon, also cut small. Line 
a deep dish with good puff paste, put a layer of the beef and 
bacon in the bottom of the dish, season with pepper and salt, 
cover with a layer of peeled and sliced tomatoes. Sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and dots of butter rolled in flour ; add more meat 
and more tomatoes, until the dish is full. Cover the top layer 
with bits of butter, them with a crust of puff paste, making holes 
in this for the escape of steam. Bake until brown. 

Beef and potato pie 

Moisten three cupfuls of minced roast beef with a little stock, 
season to taste, and put it into a greased pudding-dish. Into a 
large cupful of mashed potatoes beat a little milk and a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Season this potato and spread it over 
the top of the minced beef. Set it in the oven and bake, covered, 
for twenty minutes ; uncover, wash over with beaten white of 
eggs and cook for fifteen minutes longer, or until it is lightly 
browned. 



392 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Beefsteak pie 

Cut two pounds of round steak into small squares. Cover 
(barely) with cold water and cook tender, very slowly. Cut two 
veal kidneys into cubes and (if you can get it) a sweetbread, 
blanched by throwing it into cold water, after parboiling it. 
Drain the liquor from the beef, and let both get almost cold. 
Make a good gravy by thickening this liquor with a tablespoon- 
ful of butter rolled in browned flour, seasoning well with kitchen 
bouquet, onion juice, salt and pepper. Let it simmer two min- 
utes. Arrange the beef, kidneys and sweetbread in neat layers 
in the dish, interspersing these with a dozen small oysters. Pour 
in the gravy, cover with a good crust, half an inch thick, and 
cook, covered, one hour ; then brown. 

Kidney pie 

Cut four kidneys into neat squares and stew gently in weak 
stock for half an hour. Cook a quarter-pound of macaroni till 
tender, and cut it into inch lengths. Butter a baking-dish and 
put in a layer of macaroni ; over that spread a layer of sliced 
kidneys, seasoned with pepper, salt and made mustard. Sprinkle 
over a little flour, and add a layer of tomatoes. Repeat thesf 
layers and cover with fine bread-crumbs when the dish is filled. 
Pour in a rich gravy made from the stock in which the kidneys 
were stewed ; put small bits of butter over the j&rumbs on top, and 
bake steadily for one hour. 

Sweetbread pie 

Blanch two sweetbreads by parboiling for ten minutes, then 
leaving in ice-cold water for the same length of time. When 
firm cut into half-inch squares. Make a white roux by cooking 
in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of flour in two of butter, add 
gradually a cupful of cream heated with a pinch of soda, season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt and half a saltspoonful of white 
pepper, a % f ew grains of cayenne, and two tablespoonfuls of stewed 



MEATS 393 

and strained tomato. Put the sweetbreads and sauce into a deep 
dish, cover with a rich crust, make a slit in the center ; bake, cov- 
ered, half an hour, then brown. Beat one egg, add half a cupful 
of hot cream, and pour into the opening in the crust just before 
serving. 

Mutton chop pie 

Trim two pounds of tender chops by cutting away skin, fat, 
and two inches of the rib bone. With the refuse trimmings make 
a gravy by cooking slowly three hours in just enough water to 
cover them. Let it cool, skim off all the fat, season highly, thick- 
en well with browned flour, boil up once and again let it cool. 

Arrange the chops on the inside of a bake-dish, overlapping one 
another ; fill the central space with chopped mushrooms, a chopped 
tomato, six small button onions and a pint of green peas. Pour 
in the gravy ; cover with a good crust, make a slit in the middle 
and bake, covered, half an hour ; then brown. 

Veal chop pie 

May be made as above; substituting chopped tomatoes for the 
green peas. In this case have the gravy very thick, as the tomato 
juice will thin it. 

Small pork pies 

(A Devonshire recipe.) 

Chop fine a quarter of a pound of beef kidney suet and mix 
with it an equal quantity of butter. Rub both into a pound of 
flour and set all over the fire in a saucepan until the butter and 
suet are melted and the flour very hot. Knead together then 
into a stiff paste, cover with the cloth and put it near the fire 
while you make ready the meat. There should be about two 
pounds of the neck of pork, and this should be cut into very 
small pieces, seasoned liberally with salt, pepper and a teaspoon- 
ful of powdered sage, and cooked gently for twenty-five min- 
utes before it goes into the pie. The paste must then be divided 
into as many pieces as you wish to have pies, and these must be 



394 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

made into round shapes "built up" into the shape of round pies. 
The way to do this must be studied carefully, for it is a knack 
in itself. The fist is put into the middle of the piece of dough 
from which the pie is to be raised, and by working it in a circular 
fashion the hollow is formed which is to receive the meat. The 
process should really be seen to be adequately understood. When 
the pie is "raised" the meat is put into it, a round of paste laid on 
the top and its edge pinched to that of the lower crust. It is 
then baked in a steady, rather slow, oven. 

An English pork pie 

Cook two pounds of lean pork for half an hour in enough weak 
stock to cover it. Let it get cold in the liquor ( which reserve for 
the gravy). Take out the cold meat and cut into neat dice. But- 
ter a deep dish and lay in some of the meat. Cover with a layer 
of hard-boiled eggs, chopped coarsely; season with onion juice, 
pepper, salt and a pinch of nutmeg. Stick bits of butter here and 
there. Dust with browned flour. 

Strain and' reheat the liquor in which the meat was cooked; 
stir in a lump of butter rolled in browned flour, cook one minute, 
add a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce ; pour into the pie, and 
let it cool before covering with a good paste. Cut a slit in the 
middle of the crust ; bake, covered, three-quarters of an hour. 
Uncover, wash with white of egg and brown. 

Send around apple sauce with it. 

A New England pork pie 

Boil half a pound of "streaked" salt pork with a sliced onion 
and four parsnips of moderate size. Put them on in enough cold 
water to cover them, and boil until the parsnips are tender, the 
onion cooked to rags. Have ready three fair-sized potatoes, 
sliced and parboiled. Slice the parsnips. Cut the pork into very 
small, thin slices, and line a deep dish with it. Put in a layer of 
sliced potatoes, sprinkle with flour, salt and pepper, a layer of 
sliced parsnips, then another layer of each. Add enough of the 



MEATS 395 

water in which the pork and parsnips were boiled to fill the dish. 
Cover with a good crust, and bake in a good oven one hour. 

It is said by those who like parsnips to be very good consider- 
ing! 

Pigeon pie 

Dress, draw and singe carefully four young pigeons; stuff 1 
them with the chopped livers, hearts and gizzards and fine 
crumbs, mixed with chopped parsley, a good lump of butter, pep- 
per and salt. Run a small wooden skewer through the body of 
each, fastening the wings to the sides. Cover the bottom of your 
bake-dish with thin strips of corned ham; season with chopped 
parsley, mushrooms, pepper and salt ; over these lay the pigeons ; 
between every two birds put the yolk of an egg boiled hard, and 
two or three in the center also. Add to the dish sufficient thick 
brown gravy to cover the pigeons, cover the pie with puff-paste, 
and bake for an hour and a half. 



PORK 

Roast pig 

Lay the pig, which has been prepared by the butcher, in cold 
water for fifteen minutes, then wipe dry, inside and out. Make 
a stuffing as for a turkey, and work into it two beaten eggs. 
Stuff the pig to his original size and shape. Sew him up, bend 
his fore legs backward, and his back legs forward under him, 
and skewer him thus. Dredge him with flour and put it, with a 
little salted water, Vnto a covered roaster. Roast for an hour and 
a half ; remove the cover, rub the pig well with butter and return 
the cover, leaving the slide open. At the end of twenty min- 
utes remove the cover again, rub the pig once more with butter, 
and brown him for ten minutes. Serve very hot with apple 
sauce. 

A pig for roasting should not weigh over six or seven pounds 
after it is cleaned. If larger, it is gross food. The meat should 
be as delicate as chicken. 



396 MARION ' HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Roast pork 

Score the skin until the knife touches the meat under it. Rub 
into these lines or squares a mixture of fine crumbs seasoned with 
onion juice, a little grated lemon-peel and the juice of half a 
lemon, with pepper and salt to taste. Work in well until the 
stuffing stands out of the cracks. Put into your roaster, with a 
cupful of hot water under it, and after covering bring quickly to 
the point at which the water begins to steam. Slacken the heat 
then, and cook twenty-five minutes to the pound, basting often 
with its own gravy. 

Pour off this gravy twenty minutes before taking the meat up, 
and set in a bowl of ice to send all the fat to the top. Greasy 
pork gravy is an offense to the educated palate. Thicken with 
browned flour. 

A better plan is not to attempt to make gravy, but to send 
around apple sauce alone with the roast. 

Chine of pork braised with apples 

Instruct your butcher to cut the chine with plenty of meat on 
both sides of the bone. Sprinkle it well with pepper and salt, 
and lightly with sage and sweet marjoram. Pare, core and cut 
into thick slices three large, tart apples. Cover the grating of 
your roaster with them, strew with sugar and lay the chine upon 
them. Dot the meat with butter ; cover and roast twenty-five 
minutes to the pound. At the end of that time transfer the meat 
to a dripping-pan, turning it over that the side which has lain 
upon the apples may be uppermost. Wash ilvith butter, cover 
thick with salted and peppered crumbs, and brown upon the upper 
grating of a hot oven while you make the gravy. 

To do this rub the cooked apple and the liquor with them 
through a colander into a saucepan, add a little hot water, a lump 
of butter rolled in flour, and, if very tart, a little sugar ; pepper 
and salt to taste, boil up and turn into a boat. 

Serve peas, pudding or beans in some shape with the chine. 



MEATS 397 

Pork tenderloins 

Broil over a clear, steady fire, turning as often as they begin to 
drip. Allow twenty minutes, if small ; more when large. Lay 
upon a heated dish, cover with a mixture of butter, lemon juice, 
onion juice, pepper, salt and a dash of powdered sage. Turn 
over and over in this is it melts; cover closely and leave over 
hot water several minutes to let the seasoning sink into the meat. 

Serve browned whole potatoes and apple sauce with them. 

Boiled ham 

Soak eight hours, and scrub it hard with a stiff brush or whisk 
to get out salt and dirt. Cover with an abundance of cold water, 
and put into it two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Heat very grad- 
ually. At the end of the first hour it should not have reached 
the boiling point. Simmer gently four or five hours. Allow 
twenty minutes to every pound for a corned ham ; twenty-five for 
a smoked. Let it get almost cold in the liquor entirely cold 
before you skin it. 

Barbecued fresh ham 

Score the rind with a sharp knife. Mix one tablespoonful of 
mustard seed, half a teaspoonful, each, of celery seed and pepper 
corns with one cupful of sugar, one cupful of vinegar and two 
cupfuls of water. Let these stand ten minutes, then pour it over 
the ham. Turn it in this pickle several times during the day. 
Next morning put the ham into your covered roaster in a slow 
oven, fat side down, for the first hour. Strain the pickle and keep 
it hot on the back of the stove. Baste the ham frequently with it 
and bake four hours, or until tender. 

All of the pickle should have been used in basting. Lay the 
ham upon a heated dish and keep hot over boiling water while 
you make the gravy. Strain the liquor, thicken with browned 
flour, add salt to taste, simmer for five minutes and pour part 
over the meat, the rest into a* boat. 

Those who are fond of hot fresh pork can not do better than to 
try this. It is also delicious cold. 



398 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Breaded ham 

Boil as directed in recipe for boiled ham. When cold, skin and 
rub all over with flour. Next, brush with beaten egg, sift fine 
crumbs thickly over the egg, then more egg and another coat of 
crumbs. Dust with pepper and brown gradually. 

Eat cold, garnished with parsley. 

Baked ham 

Is seldom really "baked." Boil a ham eighteen minutes to the 
pound; leave it one hour in the liquor in which it was cooked; 
take it out and let it get really cold and firm before stripping off 
the skin. Rub the upper side with white of egg and sift over 
it bread dust a quarter of an inch thick. Pepper lightly, and set 
in the oven for half an hour, or until the coating is well short- 
ened by the oozing fat, and of a nice brown. Let it get cold to 
the very bone before serving it. If you like a suspicion of onion 
flavoring, wash the surface to be breaded with onion juice before 
going over it with the white of an egg. 

Baked corned ham 

Soak over night. In the morning scrub hard and pare away 
the underside until the meat and fat show red and white. Wash 
well with vinegar and do not wipe. Lay, skin downward, in 
your roaster, covering the side you have pared with a thick paste 
of flour and water. Have ready a mixture of one cupful of cold 
water and half as much vinegar, a tablespoonful of molasses and 
one of onion juice. Pour around the ham; cover closely and 
bake half an hour to the pound, after the water is hot. Baste six 
times with the liquor in the pan. 

Take up, scrape off the paste, remove the skin, dusting instant- 
ly and thickly with fine cracker-crumbs to stop the escape of the 
juices. There should be a cracker crust a quarter-inch thick. 
Set upon the upper grating to brown. 



MEATS 309 

Stuffed ham 

Wash a ham and soak over night ; then, with a narrow, sharp 
blade, remove the bone. Fill the cavity thus left with a force- 
meat of bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and moistened with a 
little water in which a spoonful of butter has been melted. Sew 
the ham up closely in a piece of cheese-cloth and boil until done, 
allowing twenty minutes to the pound. Leave it in the water 
until cold, transfer to a platter and put under a heavy weight for 
twelve hours. Now remove the cloth and the skin, and sprinkle 
the ham with pepper before sending to the table. 

To pickle pork 

Mix together four and a half pounds of salt, a pound of brown 
sugar and one ounce of saltpeter, stirred into three gallons of 
water. Boil for half an hour, skimming every ten minutes. Set 
aside to cool, and when cold pour over the meat packed in a 
crock or keg. 

Virginia recipe for curing ham 

Put the ham into pickle made by putting into one and one-half 
gallons of water one-half pound of brown sugar, one-half ounce 
of saltpeter and two and one-quarter pounds of salt. Boil this 
mixture for half an hour, skimming frequently ; then set aside to 
cool and pour over the ham. Leave for two weeks, remove the 
ham, wash it in fresh water; dip it, still wet, in bran, and coat 
thickly with it. Now take to the smokehouse and hang, hock 
end down, in smoke from hickory chips and sawdust for four 
weeks. Brush off the bran, wrap in brown paper and hang up 
until needed. 



POULTRY 

BOAST TURKEY 

Draw, with care not to break the gall-bag. Wash out the 
cavity three times with cold water, adding a little soda to the 
second water. You can not be too careful in this part of your 
task. 

Fill the body and craw with some one of the stuffings or "dress- 
ings" given below. Sew up the body and tie the skin covering 
the craw securely about the "scrag" or neck with cotton twine. 
Bind the legs and wings snugly to the body with cotton tape or 
strips of muslin. If the fowl be rather scrawny cover the breast 
with thin slices of fat salt pork. Put upon the grating of your 
covered roaster. Pour a cupful of boiling water over it to sear 
the skin and keep in the juices; cover and cook fifteen minutes 
to the pound, quite fast for twelve minutes or so, afterward 
steadily but slowly. Baste four times, each time very thoroughly, 
with the gravy from the pan. 

A quarter of an hour before taking the turkey up, uncover and 
wash over with butter, then dredge with flour, and shut up in 
the oven to brown. 

Make the gravy by stirring into the contents of the dripping- 
pan (when you have removed the turkey and are keeping it hot) 
the giblets, minced almost to powder, a tablespoonful of browned 
flour wet up with cold water, salt and pepper to taste. Skim 
before you add anything. Boil one minute and pour into a gravy- 
boat. 

Always serve cranberry sauce with turkey, when you can get it. 

Bread dressing for turkey 

To a large cupful of crumbs allow a tablespoonful of minced 
fat pork. Season with pepper and, if you like, a little minced 

400 



POULTRY 401 

parsley. A little onion juice is an improvement. Moisten very 
slightly with cream, or milk. 



Sausage dressing for turkey 

Make as in last recipe, substituting sausage-meat for the pork. 
If partially cooked before it goes into the dressing, it is more 
wholesome. 

Oyster stuffing for turkey 

Make a stuffing for turkey in the ordinary way of dried bread- 
crumbs seasoned with parsley, thyme and sweet marjoram, and 
moistened with melted butter. To this add twenty small oysters 
chopped fine, and with this stuff the breast of the turkey. 

Or to the ordinary seasoned bread-stuffing for a turkey add 
two dozen small oysters, moisten the crumbs slightly with the 
oyster liquor, and fill the breast of the turkey with the mixture. 

Chestnut stuffing for turkey 

Boil one quart of the large French or Italian chestnuts, shell 
and peel them. Mash smooth and rub into them two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, and salt and white pepper to taste. Stuff the tur- 
key with this as you would any other kind of dressing. 

Fillets of turkey with rice 

Skin the breast of a plump turkey, and slice away the breast. 
Use a sharp knife and hold it almost horizontal while at work. 
The slices should be nearly half an inch thick, and as nearly uni- 
form in size as possible. Dip in beaten egg, then in salted and 
peppered cracker-crumbs ; again in the egg, and once more in 
the crumbs. Set on the ice while you cook the rice. 

Put one cupful of clear chicken or turkey stock into a sauce- 
pan; add a cupful of rice, one-half teaspoonful of onion juice, 
and the same of salt, and simmer slowly until the liquid is ab- 
26 



402 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

sorbed. When the rice is tender add two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter; one tablespoonful of grated cheese, and season to taste. 
Cover and let it stand at the side of the fire until the fillets are 
ready. Heat five or six spoonfuls of pure salad oil slowly in a 
frying-pan, and when it boils, cook the fillets in it to a nice brown. 
Mound the savory rice in the center of a hot dish and lay the 
fillets about it. 

When properly made this is an elegant entree. 

Boast turkey, rechauffe 

When but half of a large turkey has been cut away, the re- 
mainder can be made presentable for a second serving by "brais- 
ing" it thus : 

Cut very thin slices of fat salt pork and cover the untouched 
side with them, binding in place with soft twine. Lay the turkey, 
cut-side downward, in your covered roaster ; pour a large cupful 
of weak stock or gravy under the grating, put on the lid and 
cook one hour, slowly, basting several times with the gravy in 
the pan below the roast. Take up the turkey, remove the pork, 
dredge with flour and set back in the oven, basting it with butter 
to "glaze" it as soon as the flour is wet through. Shut up to 
brown when you have drained away the gravy. 

Strain this through a colander, thicken with browned flour, 
add half a can of minced champignons, cook two minutes, and 
pour into a boat. 

Scallop of turkey anfl oysters 

Cut cold roast or boiled turkey into inch-lengths, free from 
skin and gristle, and put a layer in the bottom of a buttered bake- 
dish. Season with salt and pepper, dot with butter and cover 
with minced raw oysters. Season this layer, scatter fine crumbs 
over it, put in more seasoned turkey, and go on in this order until 
your materials are used up. Pour in, then, a cupful of gravy 
made by boiling down bones and stuffing in a quart of water until 
reduced to one-third the original quantity of liquid-, and straining 



POULTRY 403 

out the bones. Cover with fine crumbs, dot with butter and 
bake, covered, forty-five minutes, then brown. You may omit 
the oysters, and have a plain turkey scallop. 

Or substitute chopped mushrooms for the minced oysters. 

Turkey and sausage pudding 

This is a good way of using yesterday's turkey, if there is not 
a sightly half left to be set on again. 

Into a buttered bake-dish put a layer of turkey, cut not 
chopped into half-inch lengths. Drop bits of butter over it, 
but no other seasoning. Cover with minced, cooked sausage- 
meat, and this with three or four olives chopped fine. Proceed 
in this way until the dish is ready for the crust. Pour in a cupful 
of rich gravy made of bones and stuffing ; cover with a good bis- 
cuit-dough half an inch thick ; cut a hole in the middle and bake, 
covered, three-quarters of an hour, then brown. 

Ragout of turkey 

Break the carcass of a roast turkey all to pieces, and chop what 
remnants of stuffing you have. Add a quart of cold water, and 
cook slowly until you have but a cupful of liquid. Strain and let 
it get cold. Skim off the fat, season with onion juice, kitchen 
bouquet, salt and paprika, and set over the fire with the turkey 
meat, cut into neat cubes, and a half cupful of champignons (or 
fresh mushrooms, if you have them). Bring quickly to a boil, 
thicken well with browned flour, boil up, add a glass of claret 
and serve. Lay sippets of fried bread around the ragout. 



Boiled turkey 

An undeniably tough turkey would be better boiled than 
roasted. 

Clean, wash and fill with oyster-stuffing, for which a recipe 
was given a few pages back. Truss closely and sew up in a 
clean piece of white mosquito-netting. Lay in a pan and pour 



404 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

boiling water all over it from the tea-kettle, slowly, to toughen 
the skin and keep in the juices. Roll the turkey over and over 
in his hot bath, take out at the end of two minutes ; put into a 
pot, cover deep with cold water, and heat gradually to a boil. 
Cook fifteen minutes to the pound, always gently. If the turkey 
be large and old, give him twenty minutes for each pound. Take 
the pot from the range, leave it covered for twenty minutes with 
the bird in it. Take him out, unwrap quickly, dish, wash freely 
with hot butter well-seasoned with salt and white pepper; pour 
a few spoonfuls of hot drawn butter over him, and serve. Send 
oyster sauce around with boiled turkey. 



DUCKS 

Roast ducks 

Draw and clean, washing the inside in three waters, the second 
having a teaspoonful of baking-soda mixed with it. 

Plunge into ice-cold water; leave them there for fifteen min- 
utes ; wipe well inside and out, and stuff with a forcemeat of dry 
crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper, onion juice and finely minced 
parsley. 

Personally, I do not like sage in the stuffing. It gives a "med- 
icated tang," to my way of thinking or tasting. Many people, 
however, insist upon adding the venerable simple to the force- 
meat. Do not moisten the stuffing. Put it in dry, packing well. 
Dredge the ducks with peppered and salted flour; lay upon the 
grating of your roaster, pour a cupful of boiling water over them, 
and roast, covered, from twelve to fifteen minutes to the pound, 
according to age. Baste four times with the gravy from the 
dripping-pan. Uncover, wash with butter, dredge with flour 
and brown. 

To make the gravy, drain off the liquor from the pan; set in 
ice-water to throw up the grease, strain, add the giblets minced 
very fine, thicken with browned flour, and boil for two minutes.

Serve with currant jelly, or apple sauce, and pass green peas

Braised ducks 

Young ducks are essential for this purpose. Lay three slices 
of fat corned ham upon the grating of your roaster, and upon 
them a minced onion, a stalk of celery, chopped, a sliced carrot 
and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Clean and truss, but 
do not stuff the ducks; lay them upon the prepared "bed," and 
pour a cupful of boiling water over them. Cover the pan and 
let them cook, closely covered, in a moderate oven for about 
two hours. Take up the ducks, strain the liquor from the pan, 
and let it cool enough to remove all the fat. Then put it into 
a saucepan, and let it boil. Add one teaspoonful of lemon juice, 
and thicken it slightly with browned flour. Return the fowls to 
the sauce till hot again, then serve with the sauce poured over 
them. 

Creole salmi of duck 

Melt in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, and stir into 
this a half tablespoonful, each, of chopped ham, onion, celery, 
sweet pepper and parsley, with a tablespoonful of flour, a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of salt, and a half teaspoonful of paprika. Stir 
for three minutes, then add a cupful of consomme, two cloves and 
a blade of mace. Simmer for an hour ; strain and add to it two 
cupfuls of cold duck, cut into neat pieces an inch long. Boil one 
minute to heat the meat thoroughly, and serve. 

Garnish with sippets of fried bread. 



CHICKENS 

Roast chickens 

Singe to get rid of down, draw and wash well, rinsing the 
cavity of each fowl with soda and water. Wipe and fill bodies 
and craws with a stuffing of dry crumbs, well-seasoned with 



406 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

pepper, salt and butter. Tie up the neck and bind legs and wings 
close to the body with soft cord or tapes. 

Lay upon the grating of your covered roaster; dash a cupful 
of boiling water over them, cover, and roast fifteen minutes to 
the pound. Drain off the gravy, and set in iced water to throw 
up the fat. Wash the chickens over with butter, dredge with 
flour and brown. Clip the threads and dish. Thicken the gravy 
with browned flour, add the chopped giblets (previously boiled 
tender), boil up once and turn into a boat. 

Boiled fowls 

Prepare as for roasting ; sew up in white netting, or in coarse 
lace, and souse, four times in boiling water. Then put over the 
fire in cold, slightly salted water, covering deeply; bring slowly 
to the boil, and cook gently fifteen minutes to the pound. 

Have ready egg- or oyster-sauce, or bread-sauce. Pour a few 
spoonfuls of hot butter, salted and peppered, over the chickens, 
the rest into a boat. 

Smothered chickens 

Broilers, and other really young fowls, are necessary for this 
dish. Split down the back when you have cleaned and washed 
them. Lay them out flat on the grating of your roaster, skin side 
down, and put into a very hot oven, covered. Have ready half 
a cupful of melted butter, and after five minutes baste the chickens 
well with this. Turn them as soon as the inside has colored 
slightly; baste again with butter; when nearly done dredge 
thickly with flour and wash again with butter. When they are 
brown, and the flesh is tender in the joints, they are done. Thirty 
minutes should be sufficient. Baste frequently, and as soon as 
they are browned you may add a little hot water to the butter. 

Take up the chickens and keep them hot, thicken the gravy 
with browned flour, and boil one minute before pouring into a 
boat. 

If the chickens are large, make a gash at each joint before cook- 
ing, and cook longer. This is sometimes called "baked broiled 
chicken," sometimes, "chicken broiled in the oven." 



POULTRY 407 

Broiled chicken 

When you have cleaned and washed the young chickens, split 
down the back, so as to leave the breast in one piece. Lay in 
lemon juice and salad oil for half an hour, wipe lightly, pepper 
and salt, and lay within a well-greased broiler, skin side upper- 
most. Broil ten or twelve minutes to the pound, according to age 
and weight, turning often and never allowing it to drip upon 
the coals. When done, lay, breast upward, upon a hot dish, rub 
all over with a mixture of butter, lemon juice and minced pars- 
ley, and serve. 

Pass fried potatoes with it. 

Baked fried chicken 

Here again you must have young chickens. Clean, wash and 
cut up at every joint, dividing the breast into two pieces. Lay 
in a marinade of salad oil and lemon juice for half an hour; 
drain, but do not wipe. Roll in beaten egg, then in cracker- 
crumbs. Repeat the process and leave on the ice for an hour. 
Lay, then, upon the grating of your roaster, pour a little gravy 
in the pan beneath, and cover closely. At the end of twenty 
minutes, baste with melted butter, carefully, not to disturb the 
crumb coating; re-cover, and at the end of half an hour more, 
baste plentifully with the gravy. Now let them brown. Send 
bread-sauce in with them, and garnish with parsley. 

Braised chicken 

Cover the grating of your roaster with a blanket of vegetables ; 
a carrot, a small young turnip, an onion, a young carrot, a stalk 
of celery, all cut up small ; a little chopped parsley, and two table- 
spoonfuls of finely minced salt pork. Have ready the chicken, 
cleaned and trussed, but not stuffed. Lay, breast upward, on the 
vegetables and pork. Pour a little boiling water over him from 
the teakettle, and set, covered, in the oven. Cover closely and 
cook at least twenty minutes to the pound if the chicken be young. 



408 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

If old, extend the time. At the end of one hour lift the cover and 
baste with butter, then with the water from the pan, and shut 
up for an hour longer. Uncover then, rub with butter, dredge 
with flour and brown. 

Drain the gravy with the vegetables from the pan, rub through 
a colander into a saucepan, thicken with browned flour, boil up 
and serve in a boat. 

Baked chicken 

Clean as usual, and cover with thin slices of cold boiled ham. 
Corned ham is better than smoked, but either will do. Wind fine 
cotton cord around and around the ham to hold it in place; lay 
upon the grating of your roaster ; pour over it a cup of boiling 
hot stock, scatter parsley and sprinkle onion juice upon it; cover 
closely to keep in the steam and cook slowly twenty-five minutes 
to the pound. Baste three times within the first hour. Test with 
a skewer or a fork. If tender, it should be unwrapped, basted 
with butter, dredged with flour and left uncovered to brown. 

Garnish with the ham cut into strips. Thicken the gravy with 
browned flour, season and cook one minute. 

Fricasseed chicken 

Clean as usual, and dissect so thoroughly that the carver will 
have nothing for his knife to do in "helping" the dish. The 
breast and the back should be in two pieces, each, and every joint 
be separate from the next. 

Wash, but do not wipe. Arrange the pieces, dripping wet, in 
a pot, scatter over each layer minced onion, parsley and chopped 
fat pork ; season with salt and pepper. Cover the pot very closely 
and set it where it will not begin to boil under an hour. Increase 
the heat somewhat, but cook slowly throughout. Cook until done! 
The toughest tendons will yield to slow stewing in time. 

When assured that your end is gained, take out the meat with 
a split spoon, heap upon a platter, the white at one end, the dark at 
the other, and keep hot while making the gravy. To do this, pour 
into a bowl, set in iced water to make the fat rise. Skim, return 



POULTRY 409 

to the pot and add a cupful of hot milk thickened with a table- 
spoonful of butter rubbed into one of flour. Boil one minute 
when you have added a pinch of soda. Have ready two well 
beaten eggs, add the boiling gravy gradually and pour over the 
chicken. 

This is an old family recipe and warranted excellent. 

Pass boiled rice with this dish. 

A brown fricassee 

Prepare as for ordinary fricassee. Fry half a pound of fat 
salt pork, sliced thin, in a pan ; when they hiss and smoke, put in 
a large sliced onion and cook until it colors. Now dredge the pieces 
of chicken with flour and fry, a few pieces at a time, in the same 
fat, turning several times. When they begin to brown turn all into 
a pot with the shreds of pork and onion. Add a very small cupful 
of stock ; cover closely and cook until done. 

Have ready a brown roux, made by cooking together a great 
spoonful of butter with the same of browned flour. Stir in a tea- 
spoonful of kitchen bouquet, and add to the gravy left in the pot 
after the chicken is dished. Cook two minutes and pour over the 
dished chicken. Set in the oven for three minutes before serv- 
ing. 

A pilau of chicken 

Joint a tender broiler and leave for half an hour in a bath of 
salad oil and lemon juice. Drain, without wiping. Have ready 
three tablespoonfuls of butter, hissing hot, in a frying-pan. Fry 
a sliced onion in it, and then put in the chicken. Cook for ten 
minutes, turning often, and empty the contents of the pan into a 
pot with a broad bottom. Pour upon them a cupful of strained 
tomato sauce, and the same of weak stock chicken or veal. Stew 
gently until the chicken is tender ; take it up and keep in a hot 
colander set in the oven and covered closely. Drain off every drop 
of gravy, return to the fire and add three-quarters of a cupful of 
rice which has soaked for an hour in cold water. Cook fast until 
the rice is soft but not broken. Put the chicken back into the pot, 



4 io MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

mixing well with the rice, simmer three minutes and heap upon a 
heated platter. Sift Parmesan cheese thickly over all. 



Boiled chicken stuffed with oysters 

Prepare as usual for boiling or roasting, then fill body and 
craw with small oysters, which have been dipped in peppered and 
salted melted butter. Sew up in netting and boil twenty minutes 
to the pound if young, thirty minutes if old. Unwrap, wash over 
with butter and lemon juice; pour a few spoonfuls of oyster 
sauce upon them, the rest into a boat. 

Chicken en casserole 

Truss the chicken, which must be young and plump, as for 
roasting. Into a frying-pan on top of the range put two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a sliced onion and 'carrot, a bay leaf and a 
sprig of thyme. When the vegetables are slightly browned put, 
with the chicken, into the casserole, add a pint of well-seasoned 
stock, cover the casserole and cook in the oven for three-quarters 
of an hour. After it has been in the oven for this length of time, 
drop in a dozen potato balls, or strips that have been cut from 
raw potatoes and saute in hot butter, and a dozen French mush- 
rooms. Season the gravy to taste, and leave the casserole uncov- 
ered that the chicken may brown. Ten minutes before taking from 
the oven, pour over the chicken two tablespoonfuls of sherry. 
When you take the chicken from the oven sprinkle it with minced 
parsley. Serve in the casserole. 

Creamed stewed chicken 

Cut up a fowl as for fricassee, and put over the fire in enough 
cold water to cover it well. Bring gradually to a gentle boil. 
When it begins to bubble, add a stalk of celery, some chopped 
parsley and two tablespoonfuls of minced onion, with a bay leaf. 
Simmer until tender before seasoning with salt and pepper. 

Make a white roux in a frying-pan of two tablespoonfuls of but- 



POULTRY 411 

ter cooked with the same quantity of flour. As soon as they are 
well mixed, stir into them, a teaspoonful at a time, a large cupful 
of strained and skimmed gravy from the pot. Have ready half a 
cup of cream, heated, with a pinch of soda. Add this to the thick- 
ened gravy also, very slowly, not to curdle the cream. Do not 
boil after the cream goes in. Arrange the chicken upon a broad 
platter ; pour the creamed gravy over it, and garnish with dump- 
lings cooked in the gravy left in the large pot, after the reserved 
cupful and the chicken are taken out. 

Dumplings for chicken stew 

Into a pint of flour sift a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, 
and a quarter-teaspoonful of salt, and sift the flour twice. Now 
rub in a tablespoonful of shortening and wet with enough milk to 
make a dough that can be rolled out. Roll and cut into rounds, 
and drop these into the boiling gravy. They should be done in ten 
minutes. 

Mexican hot tamales (No, 1) 

Boil a fowl until tender; salt while boiling. Chop very fine 
and season with plenty of cayenne pepper and a little garlic. Have 
ready a thick paste made of one cupful of corn-meal mixed with a 
little boiling water. Shape the meat into rolls the size of the little 
finger, and encase each in the corn-meal paste. Take the inner 
husks of Indian corn, cut off the ends, leaving the husks about 
six inches long, and wash them in boiling water. 

Wrap each tamale in a corn husk ; throw two or three Mexican 
pepperg into the liquor in which the chicken was boiled, and cook 
the tamales in it for fifteen minutes. 

Mexican hot tamales (No. 2) 

Boil a fowl until tender ; strip the meat from the bones and chop 
fine. Mince half a pound of seeded raisins, and a half-cupful of 
stoned olives, with one young red pepper chopped "exceeding 
fine." Mix all well together, and stir to a paste with two cupfuls 



412 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

of Indian meal; wet with scalding water, season with salt, onion 
juice and a teaspoonful of sugar. Add more boiling water until 
you can stir over the fire for fifteen or twenty minutes. Then add 
six hard-boiled eggs minced fine; meantime lay smooth the soft 
inner husks of green corn, and tear some into strips for tying; 
lay upon two of the husks as much of the paste mixture as they 
will contain, wrap them about it and tie each roll with the stripped 
husk ; drop these rolls into boiling salted water, and boil them for 
one hour. 

If well seasoned, these are very savory. 

Chop suey 
(A Chinese recipe) 

One-half chicken (or quarter chicken and as much fresh pork, 
or you can make it all pork, but chicken is much better) , one large 
onion, a handful of mushrooms, a stalk of celery, six Chinese po- 
tatoes, a bowl of rice, a small dessert dish of Chinese sauce (which 
answers for salt). 

When the chicken is cleaned scrape the meat from the bones and 
cut into strips about one and a half inches long and one-half inch 
wide. If pork is used, cut the strips the same length. Slice the 
onions thin; soak the mushrooms ten minutes in water, then re- 
move the stems ; cut the celery into pieces one and a half inches 
long. Chinese potatoes require no cooking; simply wash and 
slice. 

First put chicken (or chicken and pork, or pork) into a frying- 
pan with fat and fry until done, but not brown or hard. Then add 
the sliced onions and cook a little. Add mushrooms. Now pour 
enough sauce over the ingredients to make them brown. Then 
add some water and stew a few minutes. Add celery, and after a 
minute add the potatoes. Finally, add a little floured water to it, 
making gravy of the water which stewed it. 

The Chinese potatoes, mushrooms and Chinese sauce can be 
procured at any Chinese grocery. If the rice is not cooked prop- 
erly it will detract greatly from the good taste of the chop suey. 
Otherwise it is a very palatable dish. 



POULTRY 413 

To those who do not know how to serve it I will say : Put some 
rice into a bowl, then add as much chop suey as you want. Mix 
and pour in enough of the sauce that was used in cooking it. Tea 
is usually taken with this dish. 

Canned chicken 

Joint the chicken as for fricassee, cover with cold water, and 
bring slowly to the boil. Simmer until tender, but not broken. 
When done add salt to the liquor, boil all up once, then remove the 
chicken and pack in wide-mouthed jars. Pack in as tightly as pos- 
sible. Stand the jars at the side of the range in a pan of boiling 
water, boil up the chicken liquor, fill the jars to overflowing with 
the scalding liquid and seal immediately. 



GEESE 

Boast goose 

Draw, clean, singe and truss as you would prepare a turkey. 
Always put onion and a suspicion of sage in the stuffing. Lay 
upon the grating of your roaster ; pour a cup of boiling water over 
him to cicatrice the skin and keep in the juices, and roast, covered, 
twenty minutes to the pound if of reasonable age. If of unreason- 
able, cook slowly, basting often with the liquor in the dripping- 
pan, at*least half an hour for each obdurate pound. A goose is a 
most uncertain quantity. 

At the last, wash with butter, pepper and salt him, and dredge 
with flour, then brown. Drain off and skim the fat from the 
gravy before you season the goose. Goose-grease is valuable in 
the domestic pharmacopoeia, but neither palatable nor wholesome. 

Thicken the gravy with browned flour, add the giblets minced 
very fine, boil up and it is ready. 

Serve apple sauce with him. 



4H MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Braised goslings 

Clean and truss without stuffing. Prepare a bed for them by 
slicing a carrot, an onion, a turnip (all younglings, like the birds), 
also a pared apple, and cutting a stalk of celery into bits. With 
these cover the grating of your roaster ; lay the birds upon them, 
dredge with salt, pepper and a little powdered sage, when you 
have poured a little boiling water over them from the kettle. 
Cover, and roast slowly fifteen minutes to the pound. Wash with 
butter, dredge with flour and brown. 

Take the goslings up and keep hot while you make the gravy. 
Rub vegetables and liquor through a colander into a bowl. Set 
this in cold water to throw up the grease. Skim, thicken with 
browned flour, adding two teaspoonfuls of tomato catsup, boil up 
and serve. 

Serve apple sauce and green peas, or Lima beans, with the gos- 
lings which are most eatable when half-grown. 

Salmi of goose 

Cut the remains of a roast goose into small pieces, about an 
inch long and half as wide. Have ready a gravy made by boil- 
ing down the bones and toughest scraps until you have a cupful 
of strong stock. Add to this a carrot, a young turnip, a tomato, 
an apple and a stalk of celery, all cut into dice, and the vegetables 
parboiled for ten minutes. Simmer in the gravy until you can run 
them through your vegetable press. Put in the meat and cook 
slowly until tender. Thicken with browned flour. 




GAME 

THE lower one descends in the social scale the less apprecia- 
tion is there of game of any variety. What the plebeian terms 
"wild things" play a small part upon his menu indeed, are prob- 
ably altogether absent from it. He turns with a shrug from 
jugged hare, broiled quail and roast partridge to feast upon what 
is known in his set as "plain roast and boiled." It is the epicure 
and the man of refined and cultivated gastronomic tastes who can 
appreciate good game. 

Just here it may be well to remark that game need not of ne- 
cessity be "high." Some persons profess to prefer it when it 
has been kept so long as to be a little offensive to the olfactory 
organs. Whether or not this be affectation is not for us to judge. 
Suffice it to say that the following recipes are for the preparation 
of well-seasoned game, and not for viands that bear a distressing 
resemblance to carrion. 

Saddle of venison 

Rub the meat thoroughly with melted butter, and wrap it in 
buttered paper. Put into a covered roaster with a little water in 
the bottom of the pan. Allow at least twenty minutes' roasting 
to every pound of meat. Half an hour before the meat is done re- 
move the cover and the paper, and cook, basting every ten minutes 
with butter and a little melted currant jelly. At the end of the 
half-hour transfer the venison to a hot platter ; strain the drippings 
left in the pan, add to them a cupful of boiling water, a dash of nut- 

415 



416 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

meg, salt, pepper, two tablespoonfuls of butter and the same quan- 
tity of currant jelly. When the butter and the jelly are melted, 
pour the sauce into a gravy-boat and send to the table with the 
venison. 

The loin, the haunch and the leg of venison may be cooked in 
like manner, and may be served with propriety even at a "com- 
pany dinner," although the saddle, like Abou Ben Adhem's name, 
"leads all the rest." 

Venison steak 

It requires about three minutes more time to broil than beef- 
steak, even when tender. If doubtful, lay in olive oil and lemon 
juice for two hours before cooking. Drain without wiping, and 
broil over clear hot coals, turning often to avoid scorching. 

Take up, lay upon a very hot dish, sprinkle with salt and paprika 
and spread on both sides a mixture of butter stirred up with cur- 
rant jelly. Cover and leave over hot water five minutes before it 
goes to table. 

Roast partridges 

Select plump birds, pick and clean as you would chickens, wash- 
ing them out quickly in cold water. To allow them to lie in the 
water injures their flavor. Tie the legs and wings closely to the 
sides and put the birds in a covered roaster with a cup of water 
under them. Rub with butter, dredge with flour and cook for half 
an hour. Now remove the cover of the roaster and baste the birds 
plentifully with melted butter. Replace the cover, cook for fifteen 
minutes longer, uncover and brown. 

Woodcock 

May be roasted according to the foregoing recipe, but as it is a 
smaller bird than the partridge, less time will be required in the 
cooking. The fashionable way of cooking woodcock is what is 
known as "with the trail." To prepare the woodcock, wash them 
and remove the crops. Fold the legs and wings close to the body 
and bend the head forward so that the long bill may be run, 




GAME 



GAME 417 

skewer-wise, through the legs and wings, thus holding them in 
place. Put two slices of toast in the bottom of a large, deep fire- 
proof soup-plate, and place two birds, side by side, upon this ; put 
a lump of butter upon each, and invert a large saucer or small 
plate over them. Over the opening left about the edge of the 
saucer lay a strip of pastry, that all air may be excluded. Set 
in the oven for seven minutes, then make an incision in the 
pastry and allow the steam to escape. Cover this small hole with 
a bit of fresh pastry, return the birds to the oven and cook for half 
an hour. Pour melted butter over the woodcock, serve on the 
toast on which they were cooked, and garnish with strips of the 
browned pastry. 

As some persons do not like the "trail," it may be well to re- 
mark that drawn woodcock may be cooked according to this 
recipe. 

Broiled quail 

Pick and draw the birds, and remove the heads and feet. Wipe 
out the bodies with a wet cloth, split down the back and lay open 
upon a gridiron. Broil on both sides, taking care that the delicate 
flesh is not dried into tastelessness. Lay the quail upon slices of 
buttered toast, put a lump of butter upon each, and sprinkle with 
butter and salt. Set in the oven until the butter melts, then send 
to the table. 

Boasted quail 

Clean and wash in two waters. The second should have a tea- 
spoonful of baking-soda dissolved in it. Rinse with clear water 
and wipe the inside of each bird with a soft linen cloth. Put 
within the body of each a single fine oyster, bind legs and 
wings down with fine soft cotton. Have ready thin slices of fat 
salt pork, two for each bird. Cover the breasts with these, binding 
with soft string ; lay upon the grating of the roaster, pour a little 
boiling water from the kettle upon each, and roast from twenty to 
twenty-five minutes. Five minutes before you take them up, re- 
move the pork, wash with butter, dredge with flour and brown, 
27 



418 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Cut rounds of stale bread, toast and butter them; soak with 
gravy from the pan, and lay a bird upon each. 

You may omit the oysters and fill the birds instead with a force- 
meat of seasoned crumbs. Chopped oysters also make a good 
stuffing, while some prefer to roast them uncovered and without 
the pork covering. 



RABBITS AND HAKES 

In America "hare" and "rabbit" are interchangeable terms. The 
wild rabbit of the Middle States and New England is the "old 
hare" of the South, and one with the "Br'er Rabbit" of negro folk- 
lore. Hence I shall use the names indifferently in the recipes deal- 
ing with the wily coureur du bois of both regions. 

Barbecued rabbit 

Wash the cleaned and beheaded rabbit thoroughly, and cut it 
open all along the under side of the body. Make deep incisions 
across the backbone that the heat may penetrate to the center of 
the flesh. Spread the hare open on a gridiron and broil, turning 
frequently. When done, transfer to a hot platter, rub with but- 
ter, cover and keep warm in the oven while you make the sauce 
that is to accompany the game. 

In a small saucepan melt three tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
stir into it two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a teaspoonful of French 
mustard and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. When very hot 
pour this sauce over the rabbit. Let it stand covered in a hot dish 
five minutes before serving. 

Koast rabbit 

Leave the heads on in cleaning them. Stuff the bodies with 
a forcemeat of fat salt pork, minced onion and fine crumbs, well 
seasoned with pepper and salt. Sew them up with fine thread and 
lay upon thin slices of pork covering the grating of the roaster. 



GAME 419 

Lay other slices of pork over them, pour over all a cupful of stock 
and roast one hour. Remove the pork then, wash with butter, 
dredge with flour and brown. 

Drain off the gravy, lay the bits of bacon about the rabbit in 
the dish ; thicken the gravy with browned floor. Boil up, add 
a tablespoonful of tomato catsup and a glass of claret, and take 
from the fire. 

Casserole of rabbit 

Skin, clean and cut up as for fricassee. Make two pieces of 
each back. Fry a dozen slices of fat salt pork in a frying-pan, then 
two sliced onions to a pale brown. Strain the fat back into the pan, 
keeping the shreds of onion and pork in a bowl by themselves. 
Pepper, salt and dredge with flour the jointed hare and fry, a few 
pieces at a time, in the same fat. Have ready parboiled about two 
dozen potato balls and half as many baby onions, with half a cup- 
ful of button mushrooms, canned or fresh. When the meat is well 
seared on both sides, lay some in the casserole, then six potato 
balls and two or three onions with a few mushrooms. Strew the 
chopped salt pork over them, season with pepper and dredge 
with browned flour. Proceed in this order until the casserole is 
full. Cover with cold stock or gravy, put on the cover, filling in 
the cracks where it joins the casserole with flour paste ; and cook 
slowly three hours before opening it. If tender, then drain off the 
gravy carefully not to disturb the various layers. Put into a sauce- 
pan, thicken with browned flour ; season with tomato catsup and 
salt and pepper if needed. Boil one minute ; stir in a tablespoon- 
ful of tart jelly and the same of lemon juice; return to the casse- 
role ; replace the cover and leave in an open oven for five minutes 
before serving. 

Stewed rabbits 

Clean and joint as for the casserole, cutting each joint and halv- 
ing the backs. Proceed in the same way, also, to fry the pork, 
onion and meat when you have peppered, salted and floured this 
last. 

Then pack in a saucepan, pour in enough stock (or butter and 



420 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

water) barely to cover it; season with salt, pepper, sweet herbs 
and onion juice ; cover closely and stew slowly for two hours, or 
until tender. Drain the gravy into another saucepan, setting that 
containing the meat, covered, in a larger vessel of boiling water. 
Thicken the gravy with a big lump of butter worked up with 
browned flour, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and one of 
kitchen bouquet; pour back upon the meat and let all stand to- 
gether in boiling water for five minutes. 

Belgian hares 

May be cooked in any of the ways described in recipes for pre- 
paring wild hares for table use. 

Wild turkey 

Clean and truss as you would a tame turkey, but wet the stuffing 
with melted butter, and while roasting the bird must be basted 
freely with butter. Six or seven times are not too much. The 
flesh, while sweet and peculiarly "gamy," is drier than that of 
his domesticated brother. 

As it is impossible to determine his age before shooting him, 
there are even chances that he will be tougher than if fattened 
for the table. Should this prove to be the case, steam him over 
boiling water for an hour before putting him into the roaster. 

Send currant or grape jelly around with him instead of cran- 
berry, and add a little lemon juice to the thickened gravy. Gar- 
nish him with "link" sausages, boiled and then fried. 

Roast grouse 

Here again we have dry birds. Clean, rinse out well with soda 
and water, then with pure water ; wipe inside and out, and cover 
with thin slices of corned ham more fat than lean. Bind criss- 
cross with soft twine or narrow tape, pour a cup of boiling 
water over them, and roast forty minutes, basting with the gravy 
in the pan three times. Take off the bacon, wash the birds with 
butter, dredge with flour and brown while you make the gravy. 



GAME 421 

Thicken this with browned flour, add the juice of half a lemon, 
boil up, pour in a small glass of claret and serve. Garnish with 
the ham and whole olives. 



Braised wild pigeons 

Clean, wash carefully; put an olive in the body of each and 
bind legs and wings neatly to the sides of the birds. 

Fry six or eight slices of fat salt pork in the frying-pan until 
crisp, but not burned. Strain the fat back, lay in the pigeons and 
roll over and over in the boiling grease until seared on all sides. 
Take them up and keep hot. Add a spoonful of butter to the 
hot fat, and when it hisses, fry a large onion, sliced, in it. Lay 
the pigeons upon the grating of the roaster, pour the boiling fat 
and onion over them ; add a cupful of weak stock ; cover closely 
and cook steadily for three-quarters of an hour. Test the birds 
with a skewer or fork, and if tender wash with butter, dredge and 
brown. Remove to a hot dish and make the gravy. 

Thicken with a brown roux, and season to taste ; stir in a dozen 
stoned olives. "Pimolas" are nice if you can get them. If you 
can get fresh mushrooms, fry or broil a dozen and lay about the 
pigeons when they are dished. 

Pass currant jelly with them. 

Stewed wild pigeons 

Wash well, when you* have cleaned them, rinsing out with soda 
and water, and leave in salt and water for an hour. Chop fat 
corned pork fine, season with onion juice and paprika, and put 
a teaspoonful into the body of each bird. Truss neatly, winding 
the body about with soft thread, and put into a saucepan. Cover 
with cold water and simmer gently until tender. Take up then 
and lay in a fire-proof dish. Wash with butter beaten to a 
cream with lemon juice, onion juice and finely minced parsley. 
Cover and set in the oven over hot water. 

Thicken the gravy with browned flour, beat in a great spoon- 
ful of currant jelly, add two dozen champignons cut into halves, 



422 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

boil one minute, return the pigeons to the gravy and simmer ten 
minutes. 

SdUIRRELS 

The large gray squirrel of the Southern and Middle States is 
reckoned by many epicures as superior to rabbits or hares in rich- 
ness and delicacy of flavor. The small red roisterer who chatters 
in groves and coppice, and devours the eggs and young of song- 
birds, is secured from trapper and gunner by his worthlessness 
as an article of food. There is so little of him and that little is 
so juiceless that powder and shot would be wasted upon him. 

His gray cousin-german is so toothsome when properly cooked, 
one wonders that there are not preserves of them near all our 
large towns. They are easily raised, hardy and, with -little care, 
multiply rapidly. 

Broiled squirrels 

Skin, clean and lay in a marinade of salad oil and lemon juice 
for one hour. Drain, but do not wipe. Lay upon a gridiron, wide 
open, ribs downward. Broil over clear coals, turning as they 
begin to drip. When done, remove to a hot water dish, wash with 
butter creamed with lemon juice and seasoned with pepper and 
salt. Cover and let them stand five minutes before serving. 

Stewed squirrels 

Clean, lay in salt and water half an hour, then joint, cutting 
the back into two pieces. Put into a saucepan, sprinkle with minced 
onion, and cover with cold water. Cover closely and stew one 
hour before adding four tablespoonfuls of fat salt pork minced 
fine. Cook for another hour, or until tender. Take up the squir- 
rels and keep hot. Stir into the gravy a great spoonful of but- 
ter rolled in flour. Have ready in another vessel half a cupful of 
cream, heated with a pinch of soda, into which has been beaten 
a raw egg. Pour the gravy over the squirrels, simmer one minute, 
add the cream and take at once from the fire. 



GAME 423 

Roast squirrels 

Clean, wash and lay for one hour in salad oil and lemon juice. 
Have ready a large cupful of bread-crumbs soaked in enough 
cream to moisten them, add a cupful of minced mushrooms and 
pepper, salt and onion juice to your taste. Fill the animals with 
this stuffing, sew up and truss, rub all over with butter, lay in a 
baking-dish and nearly cover with weak stock. When done, 
make a piquante sauce from the gravy in the pan by adding the 
juice of half a lemon, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, papri- 
ka and salt to taste. Boil up and pour into a boat. 

Virginia stew of squirrels 

Clean, wash and joint three squirrels. Lay in salt and water 
for half an hour. Put then into a broad pot in this order : First, 
a layer of chopped fat salt pork, then one of minced onions ; next, 
of parboiled potatoes, sliced thin; then follow successive layers 
of green corn cut from the cob, Lima beans and the squirrels. 
Proceed in this order, seasoning each layer with black, and more 
lightly, with cayenne pepper, until all the materials are used up. 
Cover with four quarts of boiling water, and put a tight lid on 
the pot. Stew gently for three hours before adding a quart of 
tomatoes, peeled and cut into bits, two teaspoonfuls of white 
sugar and a tablespoonful of salt. Cook an hour more ; stir in four 
tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in two of flour, boil three min- 
utes and turn into a tureen. 

This is the genuine recipe, over a century old, for making the 
far-famed "Brunswick stew" eaten in perfection at Old Virginia 
races, "barbecues" and political dinners. 

Chickens, lamb and veal may be used in place of squirrels, also 
"old hares." 

Barbecued squirrels 

Broil, as already directed, lay upon a hot dish, ribs downward, 
and cover with a sauce made by heating together four table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar with two of butter ; a teaspoonful, each, of 



424 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

sugar and made mustard, a half teaspoonful, each, of salt and 
pepper. Boil one minute; pour over the squirrels, and let them 
stand, covered, ten minutes before serving. 



GAME PIES 

Squirrel pie 

Clean and joint the squirrels, cutting the backs into three pieces, 
each. Put six slices of fat salt pork into a saucepan, fry three 
minutes, then put in the squirrels and fry to a light brown in this 
fat, adding, as the meat begins to yellow, a chopped onion, some 
chopped parsley and a cupful of mushrooms ; sprinkle over them 
two tablespoonfuls of flour ; add a pint of stock and simmer slowly 
until the meat is tender, seasoning, at the last, with salt and 
pepper. Boil one minute ; pour over the squirrels, and let them 
cool before putting into bakedish; pour in a gravy formed by 
stewing, add a few more mushrooms and a couple of hard-boiled 
eggs cut in slices ; cover with a good crust and bake one hour. 

Babbit pie 

Clean, wash and joint, cutting each back into three pieces. 
Leave in salt and water for half an hour ; wipe, and rub well with 
lemon juice, salt and pepper; where the meat is thick, make 
several cuts with a knife that the seasoning may penetrate. Lay 
them in a saucepan, add cold water to cover, then put in a bay- 
leaf, eight pepper corns, a bit of mace and two sliced onions. 
Cook slowly till the meat is tender. Have ready a buttered bake- 
dish and when the meat is cool lay within this, alternately with 
sliced boiled eggs, a few minced olives and a dozen tiny young 
onions which have been parboiled. Thicken with browned flour 
the liquor in which the rabbit was stewed, and add more salt if 
needed. Strain it over the meat, using enough to make it quite 
moist. Cover the dish with a rich pastry or baking-powder crust, 
make a wide cut in the center, and bake, covered, half an hour, 
then brown. 



GAME 425 

Squirrel or rabbit pot-pie 

Proceed as with the preceding recipes, until you are ready to 
pack in the dish. Add, then, three potatoes parboiled and sliced, 
and tiny dumplings, like marbles, made of a good biscuit dough ; 
cut round and boil ten minutes in the gravy before this goes into 
the pie. 

Fie of small birds 

I wish I could preface the recipe with the information that 
English, sparrows are available for this purpose. If not sup- 
pressed they are likely to lessen the supply of edible small birds 
and of warblers of all kinds to a degree inconceivable by those 
who have not watched their achievements in this line. 

Blackbirds, ricebirds and snipe may be used in families or as 
neighbors in the manufacture of our dish. 

Clean and stew the birds for half-an-hour in weak stock. Let 
them get perfectly cold in this gravy ; take out, put an oyster in 
the body of each. Arrange around the inside of your bake-dish, 
the necks all against the rim, the tails pointing toward the center. 
Put a bit of butter upon each breast and sprinkle very finely 
minced salt pork over all. Thicken the gravy with browned flour, 
season well and pour upon the birds. Cover with a good crust, 
cut a slit in the middle, and bake, covered, half-an-hour. Then 
brown. 

Quail pie 

Jcint as you would a chicken for fricassee, cover the baking- 
dish bottom with thin slices of streaky bacon, first partially boiled 
to extract the salt ; cover with a good white sauce, a few mush- 
rooms, or a little mushroom catsup, and some chopped parsley, 
then with puff-paste. Cut a slit in the middle ; bake, covered, and 
slowly, one hour. Uncover and brown. 

A combination game pie 

Wild pigeons and quails, rice-birds, snipe, woodcock in fact, 
any small edible birds may be blended in this. Clean the birds 



426 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

and, if tough, stew them in weak stock. If they are large that 
is, too large for a whole bird to be served for one portion cut 
them in halves through the breastbone. If the birds are young 
and tender they may be browned in hot butter; first dredging 
them with flour, instead of parboiling. Arrange them in a deep, 
round baking-dish with the breasts up and the feet all pointing 
toward the center. 

Make a gravy of the stock in which they were parboiled, season 
well with salt, pepper, onion juice and the juice of half a lemon; 
thicken with a rotfx of butter and browned flour. Fill in the 
central space left by the feet of the game with mushrooms, a cup- 
ful of small drained oysters, two kidneys, cut into quarters, half 
a cupful of pimolas, or with plain olives, stoned, and three hard- 
boiled eggs minced fine with one dozen button onions, parboiled. 
Pour the rich gravy over all. Cover with a good puff-paste ; 
make a slit in the middle and bake, covered, half-an-hour, then 
brown. 

Pigeon pie 

Clean and joint the pigeons and wipe each piece with a damp 
cloth. Sprinkle with pepper and salt, and saute in shallow drip- 
ping in which an onion has first been fried. Grease a pudding 
dish and put a layer of the fried pigeons in the bottom; cover 
this with minced salt pork, sliced hard-boiled eggs, and the minced 
pigeon giblets. Each piece of pigeon should have been rolled 
in browned flour before going into the dish. Arrange the layers 
as directed, until the dish is full having the top layer of the 
minced salt pork. Pour a cupful of good stock over all ; cover the 
pie with puff-paste ; cut a slit in this to allow the steam to escape, 
and bake in a steady oven for an hour. 

Venison pie 

Stew gently until tender some small pieces of fresh venison, 
and some slices of sweet potato; season with salt and pepper. 
Put into a baking-dish and cover with a paste made from the drip- 
pings from a roast of venison, allowing one-half pound of fat to 
one pound of flour. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 



THE ARISTOCRATIC ASPARAGUS 

A WRITER upon dietetics says whether truthfully or not each 
of us can judge for himself "Asparagus has nothing plebeian 
about it, as has the onion, the potato, the cabbage, turnip or pars- 
nip. It is essentially a gentleman's vegetable, and is an aristo- 
crat from tip to stalk." 

It is becoming more and more customary to serve certain vege- 
tables as a course by themselves, instead of with the meat and its 
attendant vegetables, as in days gone by. The housekeeper, who 
is often sorely perplexed as to what entree she shall serve with a 
dinner, eagerly welcomes this custom. Asparagus, artichokes and 
cauliflower may be sent in as separate courses. 

Boiled asparagus 

Cut off the tough lower part of your asparagus-stalks and save 
them to stew for flavoring your next soup. Lay the aspar- 
agus in cold water for fifteen minutes, then tie carefully into a 
bundle with a piece of soft string. Put into a saucepan large 
enough for them to lie at full length. Cover with salted, boiling 
water and boil until tender. If young, twenty minutes should 
suffice. Drain carefully and lay neatly on a hot dish. Pass 
drawn butter with the asparagus. 

Asparagus on toast 

Cut the woody part from a bunch of asparagus, and with a soft 
piece of twine tie it into a loose bundle. Have ready, boiling, 
enough salted water to cover the asparagus. The saucepan con- 

427 



428 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

taining this should be large enough to allow the asparagus to lie 
at full length. Boil until tender, but not until the green tips begin 
to break. Spread upon a platter crustless slices of buttered toast ; 
drain the asparagus, and lay it in a neat pile upon the toast. Of 
course the string must be removed from the bundle. Just before 
sending to the table pour a white sauce over the asparagus. An 
excellent plan is to pour this sauce only over the green ends of 
the stalks, leaving the white ends uncovered, that the fingers need 
not be soiled in handling the vegetable. 

Baked asparagus 

Cut the tender halves of the asparagus-stalks into inch-lengths. 
Cook for fifteen minutes in salted boiling water, then drain. 
Grease a pudding dish and put in the bottom a layer of the 
asparagus. Sprinkle this with fine bread-crumbs, bits of butter, 
pepper and salt and small pieces of hard-boiled egg. Now put in 
another layer of asparagus, more crumbs, etc., and so on until 
the dish is full. The last layer must be sprinkled with crumbs 
and bits of butter. Bake for half an hour, and serve in the dish 
in which it is cooked. 



Asparagus tips caches 

Cut the tops from square breakfast-rolls, and scoop the crumbs 
from the insides, leaving box-like crusts. Butter the outside and 
inside of these hollowed rolls and set them with the tops beside 
them in the oven to dry and brown lightly. 

Boil asparagus tips tender in salted water and drain. Have 
ready on the stove a white sauce made by cooking together a 
tablespoonful of butter and one of flour, and adding to them a 
cup and a half of milk. Stir into this sauce the asparagus tips, 
and pepper and salt to taste. Fill the hollowed rolls with the 
mixture, replace the tops and set in the oven just long enough to 
become very hot. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 429 

Creamed asparagus 

Reject the lower halves of your asparagus stalks and boil the 
upper halves until they are very tender. Then drain and chop. 
Cook together a tablespoonful of butter and two of flour until 
they bubble, pour on them a pint of milk with a bit of soda dis- 
solved in it. Stir until smooth and of the consistency of cream, 
add the minced asparagus, with salt and pepper to taste. Set 
this mixture aside until cool, then beat into it three well-whipped 
eggs and two tablespoonfuls of cream. Pour into a greased pud- 
ding dish and bake covered for twenty minutes ; uncover and 
brown. 

Asparagus a la vinaigrette (No. 1) 

Boil the asparagus according to the directions given in the 
preceding recipe. When done, drain and set aside until cold, then 
place in the ice-box until wanted. Lay upon a chilled platter 
and pour over the stalks the following dressing : 

Put three tablespoonfuls of salad oil into a bowl and stir into it 
a tablespoonful of vinegar, a saltspoonful, each, of salt and sugar, 
and a dash of paprika. 

The asparagus and the dressing that accompany it should be 
served very cold. 

Asparagus t, la vinaigrette (No. 2) 

Cook as directed in recipe for boiled asparagus. While the 
vegetable is cooking make a hot French dressing by putting to- 
gether in a saucepan over the fire half-a-dozen tablespoonfuls of 
salad oil, two of vinegar, two teaspoonf uls of French mustard, half 
a teaspoonful of sugar, salt and pepper to taste. When the aspar- 
agus is tender, drain, lay it in a deep dish, and pour over it the 
hot dressing. Cover and set aside to cool, then stand in the ice- 
chest for an hour or two before serving. 

Asparagus loaf 

Cook three cupfuls of the asparagus tips until tender, then 
drain. Put into a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter and 



430 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

one tablespoonful of flour ; cook together one minute. Add one 
cupful of milk, one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of paprika. Add the milk slowly, stirring all the time, 
and let it cook five minutes. Take from the fire and add four well- 
beaten eggs, one cupful of asparagus tips and a teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley. Line a well-buttered baking dish with the re- 
mainder of the asparagus tips ; pour in the asparagus and sauce, 
and cook with the dish in water in the oven for fifteen minutes. 
Serve with egg sauce. 



ARTICHOKES 

The American artichoke, indigenous to this country, has re- 
ceived, nobody living can say why, the absurd name of "Jerusalem 
artichoke." It is a tuber, resembling in appearance a turnip when 
cooked, but far more agreeable in flavor. 

The Italian artichoke articiocco was introduced into this coun- 
try some years ago, and speedily became a fashionable edible. 
The part eaten is the succulent bud, cut before it expands into a 
flower. 

Boiled Jerusalem artichokes 

Wash the artichokes thoroughly, pare and slice or trim them 
into an oblong shape. Cook in slightly salted boiling water until 
tender, but not broken, and pour melted butter over them. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and when turned into the dish, add 
a sprinkling of minced parsley and a few drops of lemon juice. 

Baked Jerusalem artichokes 

Wash and pare the artichokes, and cook tender. Then cut into 
neat slices. Put them into a baking-dish, sprinkle on a layer of 
grated Parmesan cheese and cover with a white or cream sauce. 
Sprinkle buttered crumbs over the top and bake until the crumbs 
are brown. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 431 

Boiled Italian artichokes 

Cut off the stems, put the vegetables into boiling salted water, 
and boil for half-an-hour. Cut in half from top to bottom and 
serve half-an-one to each person. Pass with them a Hollandaise 
sauce. The stems are stripped off by the person eating the arti- 
choke, the soft end dipped in the sauce and eaten. The fuzzy 
part should be scraped off and the bottom of the artichoke, which 
is really the most delicate portion, eaten with a fork. 

Italian artichokes with sauce tartare 

Remove the stems and outer leaves from the artichokes, and 
with a sharp knife remove the cores or centers. Lay these in cold, 
salted water for half-an-hour, drain and put into a saucepan with 
enough salted, boiling water to cover them. Cook until tender, 
drain thoroughly, put into a heated vegetable dish, and pour over 
them a sauce made of a half-cupful of melted butter, into which 
you have beaten a teaspoonful of lemon juice, a few drops of 
onion juice, a saltspoonful of French mustard, a pinch, each, of 
salt and paprika, and a teaspoonful of salad oil. Beat this sauce 
all together over the fire, remove from the range, and stir it, very 
slowly, into one beaten egg. Unless this is done gradually, the 
hot liquid will curdle the egg. Beat hard for a minute before 
pouring over the artichokes. 

Fried Italian artichokes 

Cut off the leaves and trim away the wool from the stalks. 
Cook tender, but not until broken, in salted water ; drain and set 
on ice until perfectly cold. Make a good batter of half a cupful 
of flour sifted twice with a quarter teaspoonful of baking-powder 
and a little salt, wet up with half a cupful of milk into which has 
been beaten one egg. 

Cut each artichoke, perpendicularly, into halves, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dip into the batter and fry in deep cottolene or 
other fat. Drain off every drop of fat and serve hot with a tart 
sauce. 



432 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

BANANAS 

Bananas sautes 

Peel, cut lengthwise into thirds ; roll in flour, slightly salted and 
peppered. Heat two tablespoonfuls of butter, or clarified drip- 
ping in a frying-pan; put in the bananas and fry to a golden 
brown, turning several times. Serve upon buttered toast. 

Bananas fried whole 

Peel and cut off the tip at each end ; sprinkle with pepper and 
salt, roll in beaten egg, then in fine crumbs, again in egg, and 
again crumb them. Leave them upon ice for an hour or two, and 
fry in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat to a delicate brown. 
Serve very hot. 

Baked bananas 

Strip off one-third of the skin of each, and with a silver knife 
loosen the skin around the fruit. Arrange in a baking-pan with 
the stripped side uppermost. On each banana place a quarter 
teaspoonful of butter, sprinkle with one teaspoonful of sugar and 
a half teaspoonful of water for each banana, and bake about 
twenty minutes. 

Scalloped bananas 

Peel, slice and arrange in a buttered bake-dish, alternately with 
fine crumbs. Sprinkle each layer with salt, pepper and butter, 
also with a little cream. Let the uppermost layer be crumbs, well- 
buttered and wet with cream. Bake, covered, half-an-hour, then 
brown. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 433 



BEANS 

Boston baked beans (No. 1) 

SOAK a quart of beans in cold water all night. In the morning 
soak them for two hours in warm water. Drain, put into a pot 
with enough water to cover them, and bring them slowly to a 
boil. When they are tender, turn then into a deep bake-dish ; 
first pouring off the surplus water. Cut gashes in a half-pound 
piece of parboiled salt pork, and place this in the center of the 
dish. To a pint of the water in which the beans were boiled 
add a gill of molasses and a saltspoonful of French mustard. 
Mix well, and pour this over the beans and pork. Cover the dish 
and bake in a steady oven for six hours. 



Boston baked beans (No. 2) 

Wash a quart of beans, let them stand over-night in a gallon of 
cold water. In the morning, pour off the water and wash again. 
Then place in a pot, cover with plenty of water, and set over the 
fire. 

Rave the pork all fat if possible, unless lean is preferred. 
Score the rind deeply. Put the beans and pork over the fire and 
simmer until the beans begin to crack open, not any longer. 
Drain all the water from them and rinse again with cold water. 
Put about half the beans in the pot, and then the pork, rind-side 
up. Next, put in the remainder of the beans. Mix a teaspoonful, 
each, of mustard and sugar with pepper, and a great spoonful 
of molasses with a pint of boiling water and pour over the beans. 
Cover the pot, set in a slow oven and bake ten hours, adding boil- 
ing water whenever the beans look dry. Do not have the fire so 
hot that the water on the beans bubbles, and have no more water 
than will barely come to the top of the beans. Use an earthen 
pot.

434 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

New Jersey baked beans 

Soak and boil the beans in the same way as before described 
only change the water in which they are boiled an hour before 
they are done and boil the pork with the beans ; a slice of onion 
and a tiny piece of bay-leaf may be added to the first water. 
When they are ready for baking fill a shallow basin with them ; 
place the pork in the center with the scored rind exposed, with 
one or two tablespoonfuls of molasses, some white pepper, and 
one tablespoonful of butter in small bits sprinkled all over the 
beans; bake, covered, about two hours. Enough of the water 
in which they were boiled should be poured in to make them soft, 
and about an hour before they are done one cupful of sweet 
cream, heated, with a pinch of soda, may be poured in upon the 
beans, loosening them with a fork that the cream may soak in. 

Sunnybank baked beans 

Soak over night and boil tender as already directed. Parboil 
half a pound of pork and chop fine. Have ready a large cupful 
of strained tomato sauce, well seasoned with onion juice, butter, 
salt and a good deal of sugar. Put a layer of minced pork in the 
bottom of your dish ; then one of beans, next tomato sauce. Pro- 
ceed in this way until the dish is full ; add a very little hot water ; 
cover closely and bake two hours, then brown. 

It will be found very good, a vast improvement upon the con- 
ventional pork and baked beans. The top layer should be of to- 
mato sauce. 

Baked beans with tomato sauce 

Soak white beans over night in cold water, and in the morn- 
ing put over the fire in boiling water, slightly salted. Cook until 
tender. Drain and put into a deep dish. Cover with a tomato 
sauce, made by cooking together a tablespoonful, each, of butter 
and flour until they bubble, and then pouring upon them a cupful 
of strained tomato liquor. Season to taste, and rather highly, un- 
less you have previously added salt and pepper to the beans. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 435 

Stir the sauce in with these and bake, closely covered, for two 
hours. 

Beans sautes 

Soak beans over night and boil until tender. Drain very dry 
and sprinkle with salt. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a 
frying pan, and when this has melted fry in it a large onion sliced. 
When the onion has browned remove it with a perforated spoon, 
and stir into the butter a tablespoonful of minced parsley. Now 
add the beans and turn them over and over in the hissing butter 
until very hot. Sprinkle lightly with salt (if needed) and pepper. 
Turn into a colander, then into a hot dish. 

Stewed beans 

Soak over night. In the morning parboil for one hour, drain, 
put them over the fire in enough weak stock to cover them and 
stew two hours, slowly. For the last hour set in a pan of boiling 
water to prevent scorching. All the stock should be absorbed, 
yet the beans should not be dry. At the end of two hours stir 
in a sauce made of one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful 
of mustard and the same of molasses, with twice as much onion 
juice and the juice of half a lemon, mixed in half a cupful of boil- 
ing water. Leave, covered, upon the fire for ten minutes (still 
in boiling water) and turn out. 

Lima beans 

Shell, lay in cold water for half an hour, and cook half an hour 
in boiling water, a little salted. Drain, dish, toss about over a 
lump of butter, and salt and pepper to your liking. 

Lima beans with white sauce 

Cook as directed in last recipe, but instead of dishing after 
draining, return to the saucepan with a good white sauce into 
which you have stirred a little chopped parsley. Simmer three 
minutes and serve.

Boiled string beans 

You can not destroy this dish more effectually than by "string- 
ing" the beans in the slovenly manner practised by at least one- 
half of American cooks, or those who represent the American 
kitchen. The neatest way of ridding beans of backbones is to 
pare each the whole length with a sharp knife. The flavor is 
more delicate when this is done. 

Lay a handful of the pods upon a board with the ends even, 
and cut through all into inch-pieces. Wash and cook in boiling 
salted water until tender. Drain, season with butter, salt and pep- 
per, and serve. 

Full-grown beans demand much more time for cooking than 
young. Underdone beans have a rank taste and are unwholesome. 

Steamed cream string beans 

By some they are called "butter beans," by others "German wax 
beans." They are sweeter and richer than the ordinary green 
string bean. Put into cold water for half an hour after paring the 
fiber lightly from each side of the pods, taking care not to touch 
the beans inside. Then, with a sharp knife cut them into slant- 
ing slivers, three for each bean, and each a little over an inch long. 
Wash and put the dripping beans into a saucepan containing a 
great spoonful of warmed (not hot) butter, pepper and salt to 
taste. Add three tablesponfuls of warm water. Cover closely, 
and bring slowly to a gentle simmer. Now and then shake the 
saucepan upward to make sure the beans are not sticking to the 
bottom, but do not open it, as everything depends upon the steam. 
Young beans may be tender in forty minutes. Large or stale will 
not be fit to eat under one hour. Do not put more than three 
tablespoonfuls of water for a quart of beans, and dish without 
draining. 

String beans of any kind are nicer when cooked in this way 
than any other. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 437 

Savory string beans 

String and cut the beans diagonally as just directed, and boil 
tender in salted water. Have ready a roux of butter and flour, 
and mix it with half a cupful of gravy of any kind. Stir until 
smooth, seasoning with pepper, salt and a little onion. Strain 
this sauce over the beans and cook for five minutes longer. 



BEETS 

Boiled beets 

As THE preliminary process to all dishes composed of beets 
is boiling it is well to learn exactly how this should be done. 
Too often the once ruddy vegetable is allowed to "bleed" out its 
juices until it has a pallid and uninviting appearance. 

Wash the beets, rubbing them carefully with the palm of the 
hand to dislodge dirt, but not so hard as to abrade the tender 
skin. Drop into fresh cold water as you cleanse them. Put into 
a saucepan of salted boiling water and cook for an hour. Drain, 
scrape, slice and serve in a deep dish with melted butter poured 
over them. They are best when a tablespoonful of hot vinegar is 
added to the melted butter. 



Creamed young beets 

Cook with two inches of the stem on to prevent bleeding, and do 
not clip the tap root. Have ready a cupful of cream heated with 
a pinch of soda. Rub the skins off, top and tail the beets, and 
slice them thin into the cream, setting the saucepan containing 
it in boiling water. When all are in stir in a tablespoonful of 
butter rubbed into one of flour, pepper, salt and a teaspoonful, 
each, of sugar and onion juice. Simmer two minutes to cook the 
flour, and dish.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Boiled Brussels sprouts 

REMOVE the outer leaves and lay the sprouts in cold salted water 
for three-quarters of an hour. Drain and boil in salted water for 
about fifteen minutes, or until tender. Try with a fork, and if 
they are tender, but not soft, all through, they are done. Drain 
and lay in a hot dish and pour over them a half cupful of melted 
butter in which has been stirred a half saltspoonful, each, of salt 
and pepper. Serve very hot. 

Brussels sprouts au gratin 

Boil the sprouts tender in salted water, drain and cut each 
sprout in four pieces. Cook together a tablespoonful, each, of 
butter and flour, and when they are blended pour upon them a 
scant pint of milk. When you have a smooth -sauce stir the quar- 
tered sprouts into this. Season to taste, turn all into a greased 
pudding-dish, strew thickly with crumbs and bits of butter, and 
bake to a light brown. Serve in the dish in which they were 
baked. 



CABBAGE 

THOSE who know cabbage as it is served with the old-fashioned 
"boiled dinner" have no conception of the many delightful 
changes of which this so-called plebeian vegetable is susceptible. 
In summer, when it is young and tender, it is particularly good, 
and may be so cooked that it is as palatable and delicate to the 
taste as its refined cousin, the cauliflower. Have the water boil- 
ing when the vegetable is thrust into it, head down, and keep it at 
a hard boil until done. Some housekeepers claim that a tea- 
spoonful of vinegar added to the water will dissipate the obnox- 
ious odor. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 439 

Savory boiled cabbage 

Cut a firm cabbage into four parts and reject the outer leaves. 
Wash carefully in two waters, taking care to dislodge any insects 
that may be concealed between the leaves. Have a large pot of 
boiling water on the range ; dissolve in a tablespoonful of salt 
and a quarter of a teaspoonful of baking soda. Plunge the cab- 
bage into this, and cook, uncovered, for fifteen minutes, drain, and 
fill the pot with more boiling water, adding salt as you do so. 
Cook the cabbage until tender, always uncovered, turn into a 
colander, press out all the water and set aside to get very cold. 
Chop fine and season with salt, white pepper, and a dash of tomato 
catsup. Heat in a saucepan a large cupful of well-seasoned soup 
stock, turn the cabbage into this and toss and turn until very hot. 
Now add a large spoonful of melted butter, and a teaspoonful of 
lemon juice, and serve. 

Baked cabbage 

Boil cabbage tender in two waters, drain and set aside until 
cold, then chop fine. Mix together two beaten eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of cream, a salt- 
spoonful of salt and a dash of paprika. Stir this into the chopped 
cabbage and put it into a buttered pudding-dish. Sprinkle bread- 
crumbs over the top and bake until brown. 

Fricasseed cabbage 

Boil and chop, as in the last recipe, and keep hot while you 
cook together in a saucepan a tablespoonful of butter and one 
(heaping) of flour ; when they bubble pour upon them a cupful of 
hot milk. Stir to a smooth sauce ; turn into this the chopped cab- 
bage, cook for a minute, season and serve. 

Stuffed cabbage 

Choose a fresh, firm cabbage. Lay in cold water for half an 
hour, and boil in salted water for ten minutes. Remove, drain, 
and allow it to get very cold. Meanwhile make a forcemeat of 



440 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

a cupful of boiled rice and the same quantity of chopped cold 
chicken with half a cupful of minced ham. Work to a paste and 
season. Stand the cabbage on the stem-end and carefully open 
the leaves, beginning at the center. Fill the spaces between the 
layers of leaves with the forcemeat ; close the cabbage upon itself, 
tie it up firmly in a piece of coarse netting, put it gently into a 
pot of boiling salted water, and cook almost two hours. Take from 
the water, remove the netting very carefully, put the cabbage on a 
platter and pour a rich white sauce over it. If properly pre- 
pared, this is a delicious dish. 

Baked cabbage with tomato sauce 

Boil a cabbage in two waters, drain, cut it fine, and season with 
salt and pepper. Grease a pudding-dish and put a layer of the 
cabbage in the bottom of it ; cover this layer with tomato sauce 
and sprinkle with a few fine crumbs. Proceed in this way until 
the dish is full, having the last layer of crumbs. Bake for half 
an hour. 

Shredded cabbage and cheese 

Cut a cabbage into shreds and boil in salted water until tender. 
Drain and stand in a heated colander at the side of the range. 
Cook together two teaspoon fuls of butter and two of flour, and 
pour upon them a pint of hot milk. Season with salt and pepper, 
and stir in three heaping tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Cook, 
stirring constantly, for just a minute. Turn the cabbage into a 
deep vegetable dish and pour the cheese sauce over it. 

Cold slaw 

Wash a cabbage and lay it in cold water for half an hour. 
With a sharp knife cut it into strips, or shreds. As you cut these 
drop them into iced water. When ready to serve, drain in a col- 
ander, shaking hard to dislodge the moisture, and pour over all a 
dressing made by rubbing the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to 
a paste with one beaten egg, a half cupful of salad oil, the juice of 
a lemon, mustard, salt and pepper to taste. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 441 

Cabbage cream salad 

Prepare as in the preceding recipe, only cutting the shreds into 
inch-lengths before dropping them in iced water. Beat a pint of 
cream very stiff. Drain the cabbage, sprinkle lightly with salt, 
and stir it into the whipped cream, turning and tossing until it is 
thoroughly coated with the white foam. Serve at once with 
crackers and cheese. The cabbage should be tender and crisp for 
this dish. 

An Italian dish of cabbage 

Boil a cabbage in two waters ; drain ; when cold, chop coarsely, 
and season with salt and pepper. Butter a pudding-dish, put a 
layer of the cabbage in this ; sprinkle with buttered crumbs and a 
teaspoonful of grated Parmesan cheese. Put in more cabbage, 
more crumbs and cheese, and, when the dish is nearly full, pour 
a cup of seasoned beef stock over all. Bake for half an hour. 

Scalloped cabbage 

Boil a head of cabbage in two waters ; drain ; let it cool, and 
chop fine. Cover the bottom of a baking-dish with bread-crumbs ; 
scatter over these tiny morsels of butter, seasoned with pepper, 
salt and a few drops of onion juice ; spread with a layer, an inch 
thick, of the minced cabbage. Season this layer with salt, butter- 
bits, and a sharp dash of lemon juice. Repeat the crumbs, then a 
second stratum of cabbage, a cupful of boiling milk, and cover all 
thickly with bread-dust, well seasoned. Sift grated cheese upon 
the top, and bake, covered, until bubbling hot. Uncover and 
brown. You can use weak stock in place of milk if you have it. 
Boil a pinch of soda in the milk. An excellent family dish. 

CARROTS 

Stewed carrots 

WASH, scrape off the skin, cut into dice and leave in cold water 
for half an hour. Put, then, into the inner compartment of a 
double boiler with no water upon them except that which clings 



442 MARION HARLAND'S COOK LOOK 

to them after washing. Cover closely, and cook tender. An 
hour should be long enough for this. Turn into a deep dish, 
pepper and salt, and cover with a good white sauce. 

Mashed carrots 

Scrape and slice carrots, and boil tender in two waters. Drain, 
rub through a colander, and mash with a potato-beetle. Beat 
light with a tablespoonful of melted butter, add salt and pepper, 
and serve very hot. 

Carrots sautes 

Boil young carrots, not longer than your forefinger, for eight 
minutes in salted water. Rub and scrape off the skins; cover 
with boiling water and cook tender. Drain, lay for a minute in 
cold water until you can handle them, and cut each carrot in two, 
each half into strips. Heat a tablespoonful of butter in a frying- 
pan with a half teaspoonful of white sugar, a little salt and pep- 
per, and when it boils lay in the strips of carrot. Cook three 
minutes after the bubble recommences; sprinkle with chopped 
parsley, toss about for one minute, drain and serve hot. 

Carrot croquettes 

Wash and scrape and cook until very tender. Mash smooth 
and beat to a paste with the yolk of a raw egg, a good spoonful 
of softened butter, pepper and salt to taste. Let this paste get 
cold and stiff before . making into croquettes or balls. Roll in 
beaten egg, then in fine crumbs ; set on ice for an hour and fry 
in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. Drain and serve hot. 



CAULIFLOWER 

Cauliflower boiled whole 

CHOOSE a fine, white head for this purpose. Put it, flower 
downward, into ice-cold salted water for half an hour. Tie, 
then, in coarse cheese-cloth or netting, and plunge, head fore- 



DINNER VEGETABLES 443 

most, into a pot of boiling salted water. Cook half an hour, 
drain, take off the cloth and dish. Pour a rich white sauce over it. 

Cauliflower au gratin 

Cut a large cauliflower into eight pieces and boil tender in salted 
water. Drain, lay in a deep pudding-dish, stems down, and pour 
over it a plain white sauce into which two hard-boiled eggs have 
been chopped. Sprinkle with bread-crumbs and bake to a light 
brown. 

Cauliflower with tomato sauce 

Boil a whole cauliflower for ten minutes in fresh water ; drain 
and boil until tender in salted water. Put into a vegetable dish, 
flower side up, rub thoroughly with butter, then sprinkle with 
salt and pepper. Last of all, pour over the cauliflower a pint of 
tomato sauce. 

CELERY 

Stewed celery (No. 1) 

WASH the celery, cut into half-inch bits, and stew tender in 
slightly-salted boiling water. Drain this off and add a cupful of 
milk. Cook for three minutes, stir in a teaspoonful of butter 
rubbed into a teaspoonful of flour, boil up once, season to taste, 
and serve. 

Stewed celery (No. 2) 

A bunch of indifferent celery may be utilized for this dish. 
I have rescued stalks frosted accidentally through the cook's 
carelessness, laid them in ice-cold water for two hours, prepared 
them as I shall direct, and presented as palatable food that whose 
end would otherwise have been the garbage pail. 

After stewing tender and draining, transfer to another sauce- 
pan in which you have heated a cupful of milk (with a pinch of 
soda in it), thicken it with a tablespoonful of butter rubbed in a 
teaspoonful of flour, and stir to a boil. Mix the celery well 



444 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

with this, season with pepper and salt, heat all together for one 
minute, and dish. 

Brown stew of celery 

Wash and cut into small bits a bunch of celery. Put it into a 
saucepan and pour over it a pint of cleared beef stock. Stew until 
tender. Drain the celery and set aside while you return to the 
saucepan the stock in which it was cooked. Thicken this with a 
paste made by rubbing a heaping teaspoonful of browned flour 
into one teaspoonful of butter. When you have a smooth brown 
sauce, stir in the celery, and when this is very hot,, season and 
serve. 

Savory celery 

Scrape, cut into inch-lengths, lay in cold water for an hour ; 
cook tender in salted hot water. Drain, and return the celery to 
the saucepan. Have ready heated a cupful of weak stock, or 
gravy, strained through a cloth, seasoned with paprika, salt and 
onion juice, then thickened with a tablespoonful of browned flour 
rolled in the same quantity of butter. Pour this over the celery, 
heat all together for one minute, and dish. 

The outer green stalks of celery may be used thus, and more 
satisfactorily than a tyro might think possible. 

Fried celery 

Scrape and boil as directed in foregoing recipes ; drain, and 
spread upon a cloth in a very cold place. They must be dry and 
firm before you dip each piece in beaten egg, then in seasoned 
bread or cracker-dust. Set again in the cold for an hour, and fry 
in deep cottolene or other fat to a golden brown. Drain in a hot 
colander and serve. 

Stewed celery roots 

Wash and scrape the roots of celery and stew in salted water 
until very tender. Drain and cut into small dice. Have ready 
in a saucepan a pint of hot milk, thicken this with a teaspoonful 
of flour rubbed into one of butter, turn a cupful (heaping) of 



DINNER VEGETABLES 445 

the celery dice into this sauce, stir until very hot, season to taste 
and serve. 

Besides being- a palatable dish when thus cooked, celery root 
is an admirable nervine, and therefore indicated as beneficial diet 
for brain-workers and nervous invalids. 



GREEN COEN 

Boiled corn 

STRIP husk andsilk from the ear and put over the fire in plenty 
of boiling water, slightly salted. Boil hard for twenty minutes 
if the corn be young and fresh. 

Send to table wrapped in a napkin. 

Stewed corn 

Cut from the cob with a sharp knife ; put over the fire in just 
enough boiling salted water to cover it. Stew gently ten min- 
utes ; turn off the water and add a cupful of hot milk (with a 
pinch of soda in it). Cook ten minutes more, stir in a tablespoon- 
ful of butter rubbed up with a teaspoonful of flour; boil one 
minute and turn into a hot, deep dish. 

Green corn pudding (No. 1) 

Grate the grains from twelve ears of corn ; beat into the corn 
the whipped yolks of four eggs until thoroughly incorporated; 
stir in now two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and one table- 
spoonful of powdered sugar ; salt to taste, and add the whites of 
the eggs whipped to a froth. Lastly stir in a tiny pinch of soda ; 
turn into a buttered pudding-dish and bake, covered, half an hour. 
Uncover, brown quickly, and send to table at once. 

If this delicious "souffle" be made of canned corn, chop it very 
fine. 



446 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Green corn pudding (fro. 2) 

Mix together two cupfuls of grated corn, two beaten eggs, a half 
pint of milk, a pinch of soda, a tablespoonful of melted butter 
and a tablespoonful of sugar. Grease a shallow baking-dish, turn 
the mixture into this, sprinkle with buttered crumbs, cover and 
bake for half an hour, then uncover and brown. 

Green corn pudding (No. 3) 

Grate the kernels from twelve ears of corn and stir into them 
the beaten yolks of six eggs and a tablespoonful, each, of melted 
butter and granulated sugar. Now beat in a quart of milk, a 
half teaspoonful of salt and, last of all, the stiffened whites of the 
six eggs. Turn into a greased pudding-dish and bake, covered, 
for half an hour, then uncover and brown. 

This, when properly made and baked in a quick oven, is a 
veritable souffle and incomparable. 

Corn fritters 

Cut from the ears a pint of sweet corn. Beat together a cupful 
of milk, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one egg, whipped 
light, salt to taste and enough flour to make a thin batter. Into 
this stir the grated corn. Beat hard and cook as you would grid- 
dle-cakes upon a soapstone griddle. They are a palatable accom- 
paniment to roast chicken. 

Green corn balls 

Grate enough green corn from the cob to make two cupfuls; 
into this stir a beaten egg, a teaspoonful, each, of sugar and melted 
butter, with salt to taste. Add enough flour to enable you to form 
the mixture into balls, roll these in flour and fry in deep fat. 

Succotash 

Cut the corn from eight ears and put it into a saucepan with a 
pint of young Lima beans and enough salted boiling water to 
cover them both. Boil until the vegetables are tender; drain and 



DINNER VEGETABLES 447 

turn into a double boiler with a cupful of boiling milk. Cook 
for ten minutes, then stir in a tablespoonful of butter, and simmer 
for five minutes longer. Season to taste and serve. Large 
"Limas" should be cooked ten minutes before the corn is added. 

Corn and tomatoes 

Grate the grains from six ears of corn ; pare and cut into small 
pieces four ripe tomatoes. Put over the fire in a saucepan ; stew 
half an hour ; season with a great spoonful of butter, a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar and one of onion juice; salt and pepper to taste. 
Cook five minutes more and dish. 

Scallop of corn and tomatoes 

Pare and cut small a dozen ripe tomatoes and turn them, or 
the contents of a can of tomatoes, into a chopping bowl and chop 
the large pieces of the vegetable into small bits; then set in a 
saucepan over the fire and bring to the boil. Drain the liquor 
from a can of corn, or grate the grains from a dozen ears, and 
put the corn into a bowl of fresh water. After ten minutes drain 
the water off, and transfer the corn to a saucepan with enough 
boiling water to cover it. Let it simmer for five minutes, pour off 
the water and add the boiling tomatoes to the corn. Let both 
cook together for five minutes, during which time stir into them 
a heaping teaspoonful of butter, two teaspoonfuls of granulated 
sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour the mixture into a 
greased bake-dish, sprinkle bread-crumbs and bits of butter over 
the top and bake for half an hour. 

Green corn croquettes 

Grate the corn from a dozen ears, or drain the liquor from a 
can of corn, and chop the kernels fine. Cook together a table- 
spoonful of butter and two of flour, and, when these are blended, 
add slowly a pint of milk into which has been stirred a pinch of 
soda. Cook this mixture, stirring all the time, until you have 
a thick white sauce; add to it the chopped corn and half a tea- 



448 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

spoonful of powdered sugar, with pepper^and salt to taste. Re- 
move from the fire and set aside to cool. When cold, form with 
lightly-floured hands into croquettes, and dip each croquette in 
beaten egg and cracker-dust. Set all aside in a platter in the ice- 
chest for several hours, then fry in deep, boiling fat. 

Corn omelet 

Grate the corn from four ears of boiled corn. Beat four eggs 
well, add three tablespoonfuls of cream and cook in a hot pan. 
When ready to fold, sprinkle with salt and pepper, add the corn 
and turn out on a hot dish. Heat the corn slightly over hot water 
before putting into the omelet. 

Creole chowder 

Heat a generous lump of butter and in it brown four sliced 
onions. Add four peeled tomatoes, four chopped green bell-pep- 
pers, and the corn cut from four cobs. Add as much water as 
may be needed in cooking, season with salt and sugar and a little 
black pepper. A full hour's cooking will be necessary, and the 
chowder must be served piping hot. 



CUCUMBERS 

MANY persons look upon the cucumber with fear as a source 
of indigestion and gastric discomfort. One able dietitian has left 
on record his opinion that a square inch of verdant cucumber is 
about as fit to be put into the human stomach as would be a like 
quantity of Paris green. 

Our cucumber, like many another abused article, is maligned 
because its enemies have never made the attempt to do it justice. 
If a few simple rules are followed it will prove less indigestible 
and more palatable than foes and friends imagine. When cooked, 
it loses many of its disturbing qualities. But, as some people 
enjoy the crisp freshness of its raw state, it is well to learn just 
how to prepare it properly. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 449 

Raw cucumbers 

See to it that the cucumber is fresh and lay it on the ice until 
wanted. Do not be content with leaving it on the shelf of the 
refrigerator. It must be in actual contact with the ice. Just be- 
fore sending to the table, peel quickly and slice thin, scattering 
crushed ice among the slices. At the table make a French dress- 
ing of one part vinegar, three parts oil, salt and pepper to taste, 
and pour over the cucumbers as you dish them. To allow the 
vegetable to lie for even fifteen minutes in the dressing is to 
toughen the fiber and make it as indigestible as gutta percha. 

Stewed cucumbers 

Peel eight medium-sized cucumbers and cut them into slices an 
inch thick. Lay in iced water for half an hour. Have a pint of 
unsalted, hot beef stock in a saucepan, drain the cucumbers and 
lay them in this. Stew until tender, then remove with a skimmer 
and lay in a vegetable-dish. Cook together a tablespoonful, each, 
of butter and browned flour, and pour upon them the stock in 
which the cucumbers were cooked. Stir until you have a smooth 
brown sauce ; add a saltspoonf ul of salt, the same amount of pep- 
per, a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet and a half teaspoonful of 
onion juice. Stir all together and pour over the stewed cucum- 
bers. 

Stuffed cucumbers 

Cut good-sized young cucumbers into halves, lengthwise, and 
remove the seeds. Fill the hollows thus left with a forcemeat 
made of equal parts of chopped roast beef and minced boiled 
ham, with half as much fine bread-crumbs. Moisten this stuf- 
fing with melted butter and season to taste. Place the halves of 
each cucumber carefully together and tie with soft twine. Place 
in a roasting-pan, pour about them a cupful of skimmed beef 
stock, and cook until tender. Remove the strings, transfer the 
cucumbers to a hot platter, thicken the gravy left in the pan and 
pour it about them. This is a Syrian recipe.

Baked cucumbers 

Peel medium-sized cucumbers, arrange them in a bake-dish and 
pour about them a couple of tablespoonfuls of water in which 
has been melted a tablespoonful of butter. Dust with salt and 
pepper, and bake, covered, for half an hour. If you wish, you 
can scallop them by cutting them in slices, sprinkling with crumbs 
and basting with bits of butter. Bake, covered, until tender; 
uncover and brown. 

Fried cucumbers 

Peel and leave in ice water for half an hour. Slice lengthwise, 
making three slices of each cucumber of fair size, lay in fresh 
iced water for ten minutes more. Wipe dry, sprinkle with pep- 
per and salt, dredge with flour and fry to a light brown in deep, 
boiling cottolene or other fat. Drain, and serve dry and hot. 



CHESTNUTS 

THE large Spanish chestnuts sold by grocers in the city, and in 
the markets, make excellent puddings with or without sugar, and, 
as vegetables, go well with poultry and beef. 

Chestnut pudding 

Boil and skin enough chestnuts to make a cupful when rubbed 
through a colander or vegetable press. Beat four eggs light, stir 
the chestnut into the yolks ; add a tablespoonful of melted butter 
and two tablespoonfuls of fine cracker dust, two cupfuls of milk, 
a tablespoonful of sugar, salt and pepper to taste; lastly, the 
frothed whites. Bake, covered, in a buttered pudding-dish for 
half an hour ; uncover, brown and serve before it falls. Eat with 
meat. 

Chestnut croquettes 

Shell and boil five cupfuls of large chestnuts; skin, and rub 
through a colander. Work into them a tablespoonful of butter, 



DINNER VEGETABLES 451 

a little salt, a few drops of lemon juice and a dash of paprika. 
Turn into a double boiler, and make very hot, then set aside to 
cool. When cold form into small croquettes, roll in egg, then in 
cracker-crumbs and set in the ice for an hour before frying in deep, 
boiling cottolene or other fat. Peanut croquettes may be made 
in the same way. 

DANDELIONS 

MAKE a wholesome and, to some tastes, palatable "greens" in 
the spring of the year. They must be gathered while very young 
and tender, or they are bitter. The best time to cut them is just 
before they flower. Throw at once into cold water, as they wilt 
soon after they are picked. 

Stewed dandelions (No. 1) 

Cut the stems from a half peck of dandelion leaves, and break 
each leaf into small bits, dropping these into cold water as you do 
so. Wash thoroughly, drain, and lay in cold water for fifteen 
minutes. Drain again, and put over the fire in a porcelain-lined 
saucepan, with enough salted water to cover them. Simmer for 
fifteen minutes while you make the following sauce : 

Cook together a tablespoonful, each, of butter and flour, and 
pour upon them a pint of milk, in which a pinch of soda has been 
dissolved. Stir to a smooth white sauce. Drain the water from 
the dandelion leaves, and stir these into the sauce. Season to 
taste, and beat in, very slowly, a whipped egg. Remove at once 
from the fire and turn into a deep vegetable dish. 

Stewed dandelions (No. 2) 

Pick the leaves from the stems, and drop into iced water. Take 
them up by the handful, dripping wet, and put, with no other 
water, into the inner vessel of a farina boiler. Fill the outer ket- 
tle with boiling water ; cover the inner closely, and cook fast for 
half an hour. Rub the leaves through a vegetable press or a col- 



452 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ander into a saucepan; beat in a tablespoonful of butter, a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, salt and pepper to taste, a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice, and, at the last, three tablespoonfuls of hot cream to which 
has been added a pinch of soda. Stir until smoking hot over the 
fire, turn out into a heated dish, garnish with sippets of fried 
bread, and serve. 

Dandelion greens cooked thus are almost as good as spinach

TENS of thousands of average American housewives know but 
one way of cooking it, and not one in a hundred performs that 
one properly. 

Fried eggplant is one of the many dishes which remind the 
eater of the small girl of nursery-rhyme fame, who 

" When she was good was very, very good 
But when she was bad she was horrid." 

When only half fried, or soaked with grease, this vegetable is 
an abomination to the educated palate and the self-respecting 
stomach. When tender and thoroughly cooked, it is one of the 
most delicious of the summer and fall garden products. 

Fried eggplant 

Peel an eggplant and cut into slices half an inch thick. Lay in 
cold salt water for an hour ; wipe each slice dry and dip, first in 
beaten egg, and then in cracker dust. Set in a cold place for an 
hour and fry in deep boiling cottolene or other fat. Drain in a 
heated colander before dishing. 

Stuffed eggplant on the half -shell 

Wash and wipe a large eggplant and parboil it in boiling salted 
water for ten minuies. Let it get perfectly cold, cut in half

lengthwise, and scrape out the center, leaving the walls of the 
vegetable three-quarters of an inch thick. Chop the pulp fine 
and add to it a small cupful of minced chicken, half a cupful of 
minced ham,. a quarter of a cupful of bread-crumbs, a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter, salt and pepper to taste. Mix well, add 
enough soup stock to make a stiff paste, and fill the hollow sides 
with this. When full and rounded, sprinkle the forcemeat with 
bread-crumbs, and lay the halves, side by side, in a bakepan, pour- 
ing three cupfuls of soup stock around them. Bake nearly an 
hour, basting every ten minutes. Remove the eggplant to a hot 
platter, thicken the gravy left in the pan with browned flour, boil 
up once on top of the range, stirring constantly, and pour this 
browned sauce about the base of the halved eggplant. 

Scalloped eggplant 

Pare off the skin, cut into dice and lay in cold salt water for an 
hour. Then parboil for twenty minutes. Drain well and pack 
in a buttered bake-dish, alternately, with fine crumbs. Dot each 
layer with butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and strew with 
finely-minced sweet green peppers. Fill the dish in this order, 
cover with a layer of crumbs wet with cream; dot with butter, 
cover and bake half an hour, then brown. 

Eggplant stuffed with tomatoes 

Halve the eggplant and remove the insides as in the last recipe 
but one. Make a forcemeat of the eggplant pulp, a cupful of 
chopped ripe tomatoes, one chopped green pepper, and a cupful of 
bread-crumbs. Season with a tablespoonful of melted butter and 
salt and pepper. Fill the hollow sides with this mixture, bind the 
two halves together with wide tape, and bake, basting frequently 
with melted butter and hot water. When tender, transfer to a 
hot platter, cut and remove the tape, and pour hot tomato sauce 
about the eggplant. 



454 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Stewed eggplant, with sauce piquante 

Prepare as for eggplant on the half -shell by halving and scoop- 
ing out the pulp, leaving substantial walls. Chop the pulp and 
cover with hot water. Season with a tablespoonful of onion 
juice, salt and pepper, and simmer for fifteen minutes. Take 
from the fire, drain, turn into a bowl and work in two tablespoon- 
fuls of soft bread-crumbs, one tablespoonful of finely-chopped 
capers, two tablespoonfuls of cold boiled tongue, minced, and, 
when well-mixed, add salt to taste. 

Pack this forcemeat closely into each half, and fit the two parts 
together, binding securely together with tapes or soft twine. 

Put into your covered roaster ; pour enough weak stock around 
it to come one-third of the way up the side, bake, covered, half 
an hour, then turn and cook the other side. Undo the strings, 
lay the eggplant carefully in the middle of a hot dish, and pour a 
good sauce piquante over and around it. 

HOMINY 

THE small-grained hominy, called at the South "samp," after 
the manner of the aborigines who bequeathed it to us, must be 
used in the recipes which follow. 

Plain hominy pudding 

Soak a cupful of hominy for three hours in tepid water. Drain, 
and put over the fire in plenty of boiling water, slightly salted. 
Boil fast for thirty minutes or until tender ; turn off the water 
and pour in a pint of hot milk, with a little salt. Cook for fifteen 
minutes, stir in a generous lump of butter and turn into a deep 
dish. 

Eat with sugar and cream. 

Baked hominy 

Stir into a pint of milk a cupful of cold boiled hominy, and when 
this is smooth, add a tablespoonful of melted butter, a tablespoon- 



DINNER VEGETABLES 455 

ful of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt and four well-beaten eggs. Beat 
very light, pour into a buttered pudding-dish and bake for about 
half an hour or until "set" and brown. This is a good accom- 
paniment to roast beef. 

* r 

Hominy croquettes 

Into two cupfuls of boiled hominy work a tablespoonful of 
melted butter ; when the cereal is free from all lumps, add to it two 
beaten eggs, and when these are thoroughly incorporated, season 
the mixture with salt and pepper. Flour your hands, make the 
paste into small croquettes, and set aside until stiff and very 
cold. Now dip each croquette into beaten egg, roll in cracker- 
crumbs, and when all are thoroughly coated set in the ice-box for 
two hours. Fry to a golden brown in deep, boiling cottolene or 
other fat. 

Hominy fritters 

Rub two cupfuls of cold boiled hominy to a smooth paste with 
one tablespoonful of melted butter. Next, thin with warmed 
milk, and add three well-beaten eggs. Finally, stir in a cupful of 
flour which has been sifted twice with a teaspoonful of salt and 
half as much baking-powder. 

Drop by the spoonful into boiling, deep cottolene or other fat ; 
or, better still, cook upon a soapstone griddle. 



KALE 

THIS vegetable, otherwise known as "sea-kale," should be bet- 
ter known in our country. In England it takes high rank and 
holds it creditably. 

Pick it over carefully, clip off the stems and lay it in cold water 
for an hour. Drain, and put it into a saucepan full of salted 
boiling water. Cook until tender, drain and chop fine. Return 
to the saucepan with three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, salt 
and pepper to taste. Serve very hot on squares of buttered toast.

MACARONI 

FEW articles of diet are more toothsome and more wholesome 
than macaroni in its various forms when properly prepared. Like 
rice, it is so often miserably cooked that its excellent qualities 
are not generally recognized. Macaroni may be bought in several 
shapes, the large, or pipe-macaroni being perhaps the most com- 
mon. Besides this there are the smaller and more delicate vermi- 
celli, spaghetti and the flat ribbon, or egg-macaroni. Recipes for 
the cooking of one may be used in the preparation of any of the 
divers phases of this food. 

Baked macaroni (No. 1) 

Break into inch-lengths half a pound of macaroni. Boil it until 
tender in weak broth. Drain off the liquor; put the macaroni 
into a pudding-dish that will stand the fire; pour over it a half 
cupful of the stock in which it was boiled, and put a tablespoonful 
of butter, broken into small pieces, here and there through it. 
Sift over it fine bread-crumbs and grated cheese ; dot with bits of 
butter and brown in the oven. 

Baked macaroni (No. 2) 

Break half a pound of macaroni into short lengths ; cook until 
tender in boiling, salted water. It must be clear and soft, but not 
broken. Drain and put a layer in the bottom of a buttered pud- 
ding-dish. Dot with butter, sprinkle lightly with cayenne and 
salt to taste ; cover with grated cheese, and on this dispose another 
layer of macaroni. Fill the dish in this order, having cheese for 
the top layer. Pour in a cupful of milk ; cover, and bake half an 
hour. Uncover and brown. 

Creamed macaroni 

Put a cupful of macaroni into two quarts of boiling salted water 
and cook for twenty-five minutes, or until tender, but not broken. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 457 

Drain off all the water and keep the macaroni hot in a covered 
dish while you make the cream sauce to pour over it. Cook to- 
gether in a saucepan until they bubble, two teaspoonfuls of flour 
and the same quantity of butter; pour over them a pint of hot 
milk, and, as this thickens, stir into it two heaping tablespoonfuls 
of grated Parmesan cheese. Pour this sauce upon the macaroni 
just before serving, lifting the latter lightly with a fork that the 
creamy sauce may reach every part. 

Macaroni with cheese sauce 

Boil tender in salted water and drain. Cook together in a 
saucepan a great spoonful of butter and a cupful of grated Swiss 
cheese. As soon as the cheese is melted, turn the macaroni into 
the saucepan and stir and toss with a silver fork until thoroughly 
blended with the sauce. Serve at once. 

Macaroni and chicken 

Boil half a package of spaghetti tender, drain, drop into cold 
water, and drain again. Lay on a biscuit-board and cut into 
pieces about half an inch long. Thicken a pint of chicken stock 
with a tablespoonful of flour rubbed into one of butter. Stir into 
this a cupful of cold boiled or roast chicken, chopped fine, and the 
cold macaroni. Last of all, beat in slowly a whipped egg, remove 
from the fire, season to taste, turn into a greased pudding-dish, 
sprinkle crumbs over the top and bake for half an hour. 

Send around grated cheese with it. You may use veal if you 
have no chicken. 

Macaroni and tomatoes (very nice) 

Break half a pound of pipe macaroni into inch-lengths, and boil 
in salted water until tender. Drain, and put a layer of the maca- 
roni in the bottom of a greased -pudding-dish, sprinkle with pep- 
per, salt, onion juice and grated cheese, and cover all with a layer 
of stewed and strained tomatoes that have been previously sea- 
soned to taste. On these goes another layer of macaroni, and so 



458 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

on until the dish is full. The topmost layer must be of tomatoes 
sprinkled with crumbs and good-sized bits of butter. Set in a 
hot oven, covered, for twenty minutes, and then bake, uncovered, 
until the crumbs are well-browned. 

Spaghetti with Swiss cheese 

Break a half pound of spaghetti into bits not more than an 
inch and a half in length, and boil in slightly salted water for 
twenty minutes. Turn into a hot colander and set at the side of 
the range to drain. Grate enough Swiss cheese to make a gen- 
erous half cupful and turn into a saucepan with three tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter. Stir well ; add the hot spaghetti, toss and 
stir for a minute, or just long enough to melt the cheese; add a 
dash of paprika and serve in a hot dish. 

Macaroni rissoles 

Have ready a cupful of cold, boiled macaroni cut up small. 
Make a white sauce by cooking together a tablespoonful of butter 
and two of flour and stirring into them a cupful of hot milk. Stir 
until thick, add a large tablespoonful of grated cheese, and, grad- 
ually, the whipped yolks of four eggs, beating all the time. Work 
the macaroni into the sauce and set aside until the mixture is very 
cold. With floured hands form into small balls not quite as 
large in circumference as a silver dollar roll in beaten egg, then 
in fine cracker-crumbs, and set in the ice-box for two hours. Fry 
in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. Serve with tomato sauce. 

Macaroni piquante 

Break spaghetti into very small bits less than an inch in length. 
Boil these for twenty minutes, or until tender, in salted water. 
Drain and keep hot while you make the folowing sauce : 

Cook together in a saucepan a heaping teaspoonful, each, of 
butter and browned flour, and when these are blended to a brown 
roux, pour upon them a pint of beef stock, and stir until smooth. 
Now add four tablcspoonfuls of tomato catsup, six drops of 



DINNER VEGETABLES 459 

Tabasco sauce, a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, a pinch of salt 
and a dash of paprika. Turn the boiled spaghetti into this sauce, 
stir all together, and pour the mixture into a greased pudding- 
dish. Sprinkle buttered crumbs and grated cheese over the top 
and bake until brown. 

Macaroni a la Napolitaine 

Have a long fish kettle half full of boiling, salted water, and 
lay a half pound of unbroken pipe-macaroni in this. Boil for 
twenty minutes or until tender. Carefully drain the water from 
the kettle and slip the macaroni gently upon a heated platter, 
where it may lie at full length. Set the platter in the oven to keep 
warm while you make a sauce by cooking together in a saucepan 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour, and pouring upon 
them a pint of strained tomato liquor. Stir to a smooth sauce, 
then season with onion juice, celery salt, pepper, and four table- 
spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese. Pour this sauce over the maca- 
roni on the platter. When you serve, cut the mass with a sharp 
knife into manageable lengths. 



MUSHROOMS 

IT is a pity there should be such a popular dread of the poison- 
ous "toadstool" that his nutritious and innocuous brother the 
edible mushroom is shunned by thousands of rational creatures. 
The most wary need not fear this joy of the epicure when it is 
bought at market or at a responsible grocer's shop. Trustworthy 
dealers run no risks in purchasing the wares from those whose 
business it is to cultivate and sell them. Mushrooms bought 
under these circumstances are no more to be feared than arti- 
chokes or Brussels sprouts. They form delicious entrees and 
tempt the most jaded appetite. 

Broiled mushrooms 

Peel carefully with a small knife and cut off the stems. Lay 
the mushrooms in a deep dish and pour melted butter over them. 



460 MARION HARLAND'S GOOK BOOK 

Remove them gently to a greased gridiron and broil over clear 
coals until delicately browned on both sides. Lay diamond- 
shaped slices of thin buttered toast in a dish, and the mush- 
rooms upon these, sprinkle with pepper and salt and pour a little 
melted butter over all. 

Fried mushrooms 

Melt a great spoonful of butter in an agate frying-pan. Peel 
the mushrooms and cut off their stems, scraping the latter. Lay 
the mushrooms with their scraped stalks in the frying-pan and 
cook, turning often, until done. Serve very hot. 

Stewed mushrooms 

Peel the mushrooms and simmer gently in salted water until 
tender. Ten minutes should suffice. Drain and keep hot while 
you make a white sauce of a half pint of milk thickened with a 
tablespoonful of flour rubbed into one of butter. Turn the mush- 
rooms into this and stir over the fire until very hot. Season with 
salt, pepper, a dash of mace, and serve. 

* 

Baked mushrooms 

Peel very large mushrooms and cut off their stems. Grease a 
shallow pudding-dish and put a layer of mushrooms, under sides 
upward, into this. Into each mushroom pour a few drops of 
melted butter. Do not put more than two layers in the dish. 
Bake, closely covered, in a quick oven until tender. This should 
be in about twenty minutes. When done, remove the cover, pour 
melted butter over the mushrooms, and serve very hot in the dish 
in which they were cooked. 

Fricasseed mushrooms 

Peel and remove the stems from large mushrooms. Make a 
forcemeat by chopping the white meat of a cold roast chicken fine 
with a few small mushrooms and moistening it with chicken stock. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 461 

Grease a pudding-dish and lay the large mushrooms, tops down, 
in this. Fill the mushrooms and the space between them with 
the forcemeat. Sprinkle bits of butter over all. Pour in enough 
of the chicken stock to make the contents of the dish very moist, 
lay a few wafer-like slices of bacon on top of the scallop, and 
bake, covered, in a hot oven for a quarter of an hour. Uncover, 
and cook for five minutes longer. Serve in the dish in which they 
were cooked. 



ONIONS 

A ONCE-DESPISED vegetable which now takes rank as a highly- 
respectable edible upon good men's and women's tables. Deli- 
cate spinsters no longer faint at fumes of boiled onions, and finical 
housewives have forgotten the rusty joke about cooking onioris 
in the middle of a ten-acre lot. There are ways of extracting the 
coarser flavor that once condemned them with dyspeptics. Coo&s 
have learned that there is as much difference between a well-done 
and a parboiled onion as between half-cooked and mealy potatoes. 
Housewives and physicians now appreciate the nutritive values of 
the esculent bulb, and prize it for these as well as for the season- 
ing which nothing else supplies. Onion juice is indispensable to 
the flavor of ragouts and soups, and is obtained by grating, not 
chopping. The superiority of this mode of getting the essence of 
the vegetable can not be rightly estimated by one who has not 
tried it. Onion seasoning should be tasted, never seen. 

Stewed young onions 

Cut off the stalks, remove the skins and lay the onions in cold 
water for half an hour. Put them over the fire in hot, salted water 
and cook for twenty minutes. Drain off the water and return the 
onions to the fire with a cupful of hot milk, in which has been 
dissolved a bit of soda the size of a pea. Add a tablespoonful of 
flour and stew slowly until the sauce is like thick cream. 



462 MARION HARLAND S COOK BOOK 

Boiled onions 

Peel and lay for an hour in cold water. Boil in two waters 
until tender. Drain, sprinkle with pepper and salt ; put into a deep 
vegetable-dish and pour over them a great spoonful of melted 
butter. 

Baked onions (No. 1) 

Peel the onions and boil for ten minutes. Drain, arrange in a 
greased pudding-dish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and pour 
over all a white sauce, to which a beaten egg has been added. 
Sprinkle with fine crumbs, set in the oven and bake, covered, for 
twenty minutes, then uncover and brown. 

Baked onions (No. 2) 

Cook tender in boiling water changed once after fifteen min- 
utes ; drain and arrange, side by side, in a baking-pan. Melt a 
tablespoonful of butter in a cupful of hot soup stock, season with 
salt and pepper and pour over the onions. Cook in a hot oven until 
the onions are brown, when they may be lifted with a perforated 
spoon and put into the dish in which they are to be served. Put 
the pan of gravy on top of the range, thicken the contents with 
browned flour and pour over the onions. Serve very hot. 

Savory onions 

Select young onions for this dishi Lay the onions in a sauce- 
pan with a very little salted water and simmer for ten minutes. 
Drain off the water ; pour over the onions a small cupful of beef 
stock and cook for ten minutes longer. With a split spoon re- 
move the onions to a hot dish, while you thicken the gravy left 
in the pan with a heaping teaspoonful of browned flour rubbed to 
a paste in the same quantity of butter. When you have a smooth 
brown sauce season it with a teaspoonful, each, of kitchen bou- 
quet and tomato catsup, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour this 
sauce over the onions. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 463 

Stuffed onions, creamed 

Boil eight large onions gently until quite tender, but not broken. 
Drain, and when cold, carefully remove the hearts or centers. 
Chop three of these hearts fine and mix with them a cupful of 
minced ham and season to taste. Moisten with rich cream and 
the beaten yolk of an egg. Fill the centers of the onions with the 
mixture, put a piece of butter in the top of each, set side by side, 
in a deep dish, pour a little milk about them and bake, covered, for 
twenty minutes. Then uncover, sprinkle with buttered crumbs 
and bake ten minutes longer. Serve hot. 

Scalloped onions 

Parboil onions and drain. When cold, cut into bits. Put a 
thick layer of' these in the bottom of a greased pudding-dish, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with bits of butter. Cover 
with a very thin layer of crumbs moistened with milk. Put in 
more seasoned onions and more crumbs, and proceed in this way 
until the dish is full. Then pour in carefully a little cream, cover 
and bake for half an hour ; uncover and brown. 

Onion custard 

Cook the onions tender in two waters ; drain, and lay in a deep 
pudding-dish. Thicken a pint of hot milk with a teaspoonful of 
corn-starch rubbed into two teaspoonfuls of butter and gradually 
pour this white sauce upon two beaten eggs. Season with pepper 
and salt and pour the mixture about the onions. Bake until the 
custard is set. 

GREEN PEAS 

THEY lose sweetness with every hour I might say with every 
minute that passes after they have been picked. The passage 
from garden to kitchen and from pod to pot should be made as 
short as possible. As you shell throw them into cold water, not

holding them in the hand until they are heated and moist. As 
soon as the last is shelled, drain and cook. 

Boiled green peas 

Shell and lay in cold water for ten minutes. Drain, turn into 
slightly salted boiling water and cook for about twenty-five min- 
utes, or until very tender, but not broken. Drain in a colander, 
put into a dish, stir into the peas a lump of butter, and sprinkle 
very lightly with salt and pepper. 

Green pea pancakes 

Boil a pint of shelled peas, and mash while hot, adding a table- 
spoonful of butter and salt and pepper to taste. Now beat in two 
whipped eggs, a half pint of milk and five tablespoonfuls of pre- 
pared flour. Beat hard and fry on a hot griddle. A soapstone 
griddle is best. Then they are baked not fried. 

Green pea souffle 

Boil a pint of shelled peas until very tender, and mash with two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Beat three eggs light and stir 
into them a pint of milk and the mashed peas. Season with salt 
and pepper, beat hard and turn into a greased pudding-dish. 
Bake, covered, for twenty minutes ; uncover and brown. Serve 
this souffle as soon as it is removed from the oven. 

Green pea fritters 

Shell enough peas to make a quart without the pods. Lay the 
peas in cold water for a half hour ; put over the fire in two quarts 
of boiling salted water and cook for half an hour, or until very 
tender, but not broken. Drain free of water, turn into a bowl and 
mash soft with two tablespoonfuls of butter and with salt to taste. 
Beat four eggs very light, add to them three gills of milk and a 
cupful of flour with which has been sifted a teaspoonful of baking- 
powder and a half teaspoonful of salt. Stir the mashed peas by

the great spoonful into this mixture and beat until you have a 
smooth, light green batter. Have your soapstone griddle very hot 
and drop your batter by the spoonful upon this. When done on 
one side turn and bake to a delicate brown. Serve very hot as a 
vegetable to accompany any kind of meat or poultry. 

Green pea croquettes 

Peas that are getting hard will do for these. Boil in just 
enough salted water to cover them well. While hot, run through 
the vegetable press. Beat to a smooth paste with a tablespoonful 
of butter and two of flour. Pepper and salt to taste, drop in a 
dash of onion juice; lastly, beat in a well- whipped egg. Stir in a 
vessel set within another of boiling water until hot all through, 
and set away until cold and stiff. Mold then into croquettes, dip 
in beaten egg and cracker-crumbs ; leave on ice for half an hour 
before frying in boiling deep cottolene or other fat. Drain and 
serve very hot. 

You may use canned peas if you can not get fresh. 



PEPPERS 

THE large, green peppers, known to the green-grocer as "sweet 
peppers," have grown rapidly into favor as a fresh vegetable, 
within the last decade. They must be seeded with the utmost care. 
A touch of the seeds against the green sides will ruin the latter 
for present use. Get hold of the inner stem and draw the clus- 
tered seeds through the opening at the stem end, without touching 
the inside walls. 

Fried green peppers 

Cut open lengthwise and extract all seeds and tough white 
fiber. Slice crosswise. Lay in cold salted water for ten minutes, 
then wipe dry. Melt four tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan 
and saute the sliced peppers in this. Lay about broiled steak or 
chops.

Stuffed peppers 

Make a forcemeat of a tablespoonful of minced ham, one of 
minced chicken, three chopped mushrooms and a cupful of boiled 
rice. Make this paste wet by adding to it a chopped tomato and 
enough melted butter to make it of the right consistency for stuf- 
fing. Smooth the stem-ends, cut the blossom-ends from green 
peppers and take out the seeds and inside fibers. Lay the green 
shells for three minutes in salted boiling water, then plunge into 
iced water. Let them lie in this for fifteen minutes. Drain and 
wipe dry. Fill with the forcemeat, replace the tips, and stand 
the peppers, side by side, in a dripping-pan containing a quarter 
of an inch of soup stock. Cook for twenty minutes, basting twice 
with a little salad oil. When done, stand the peppers on a platter 
and pour a little salad oil about them. 



Peppers stuffed with fish 

Trim the stem-ends of your green peppers so that they will 
stand up. Cut off the tips and, with a small keen knife, extract 
the seeds and as much of the tough fiber as will come away. 
Mince white fish fine, moisten it with a white sauce, season and 
fill the peppers with this mixture. Stand in the oven long enough 
to heat through, and serve. 



Scalloped peppers au gratin 

Cut large green peppers in half, lengthwise, extract core and 
seeds and fill them with minced cold cooked fish, well seasoned, 
mixed with one-third its weight of fine bread crumbs. The mix- 
ture (forcemeat) must be wet with gravy or tomato sauce. Round 
the contents of the halved pepper in the shape of the missing 
other half, sprinkle with fine crumbs, and bake to a light brown. 

You may use for these scallops of cold chicken, lean lamb or 
veal. See that you do not get the forcemeat too stiff. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 467 

Scalloped peppers on the half -shell 

Halve the peppers lengthwise, remove seeds and membrane, 
and parboil for five minutes. When cold, fill the halves with 
minced roast beef and fine bread-crumbs moistened with tomato 
juice. Bake in a covered pan, basting every ten minutes. At the 
end of a half hour remove to a hot platter and serve with tomato 
sauce poured over and around the halved peppers. 

Peppers and rice 
(A Creole dish.) 

Cook half a cupful of rice in plenty of boiling water, a little salt, 
for twenty minutes hard. Drain in a colander and set at the back 
of the range to dry off. Heap within a deep dish. 

Prepare your peppers as already directed. Slice as for frying 
in the usual way. When you take them from the cold salt and 
water, fry them in a great spoonful of butter. Lift them from the 
pan and chop rather coarsely. Add to the hot butter and peppers 
a teaspoonful of onion juice and two tablespoonfuls of stock. 
Boil up and pour upon the rice. Set in the oven, covered, for 
three minutes, and serve. 



POKE STALKS 

CUT as you would asparagus, when they are but a few inches 
high. They are then tender and succulent, and are thought by 
some imaginative vegetarians to resemble the "aristocrat" in 
flavor. 

They are undeniably wholesome also inexpensive. 

Scrape the stalks and lay in cold water for an hour. Tie loosely 
together with a piece of soft twine, put over the fire with enough 
salted water to cover them, and boil until tender. Drain, sprinkle 
lightly with salt and pepper and lay upon a platter on slices of 
buttered toast. Pour white sauce over all.

POTATOES 

"THE Tyrant Potato" is not assailed ignorantly, nor yet flip- 
pantly. After careful study of its properties, its works and its 
ways, the utmost concession that is now made to peculiar preju- 
dice is in the declaration that, since people will make potatoes 
nine-tenths of their vegetable diet, it is essential to the national 
digestion that the ninety-three parts of water and of starch con- 
tained in the tuber be cooked in such manner as shall render the 
esculent as palatable and as little hurtful as is practicable when 
the constituents are not to be ignored. 

The above protest stands at the head of that section of the 
"NATIONAL COOK BOOK" which is headed "POTATOES." I wrote 
it ten years ago, and am "of the same opinion still." 

Talk against it as we may, the potato holds its sway in defiance 
of chemistry and dietetics, and our Johns, one and all, insist upon 
its daily appearance. As one weary housewife said to me : 

"If I give my fingers to be burned in the preparation of a half 
dozen vegetables and have not potatoes in the number, my culinary 
and housekeeping skill are as sounding brass and tinkling cym- 
bals to my husband, at least. And I am so tired of the same old 
ways of cooking the same old potatoes !" 

Her remark made me wonder why housekeepers adhere to the 
"same old ways." Why not try new ones ? 

One hint may be acted upon with advantage to cook and to 
eaters. 

One of the bugbears to the housewife is paring potatoes. It is 
not a pleasant task, and the necessity of performing it recurs with 
disagreeable frequency. 

The housekeeper is wise if, while the potatoes are in the process 
of peeling, she pares and cooks more than enough for the repast 
for which they are intended, and by utilizing the cold left-overs 
does away with the necessity of peeling more of the tyrannical 
starch-and-water for the next meal. 

A majority of the recipes herewith given are based upon the 
supposition that she has done this.

butter into a saucepan and when it begins to bubble add two table- 
spoonfuls of flour ; let them cook for one minute, then add one pint 
of hot milk, season with salt and pepper and a half teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley. 

Potatoes, boiled au natural 

Wash, drop into boiling water slightly salted, and cook fast 
until a fork will pass easily into the largest. Turn off the water, 
throw in a handful of salt, and set the pot, uncovered, at the back 
or side of the range, to dry the potatoes "off." Serve in their 
skins. 

Boiled potatoes 

Pare with a sharp knife, and as thin as possible. Much of the 
mealiness of the potato depends upon this. The scullion who 
slashes away chunks of her beloved edible really deprives it of its 
chief merit, and all its comeliness. Have a pot of boiling water 
ready, salt it slightly and boil fast until a fork pierces the largest 
readily. Throw off the water immediately, sprinkle with salt, and 
dry out as directed in last recipe. 

Baked potatoes (No. 1) 

Select fine potatoes of uniform size. Wash, wipe and bake until 
the largest yields to the pressure of thumb and finger. Serve 
wrapped in a hot napkin. If the eater will knead his potato skil- 
fully between his fingers before breaking it open, he will find a 
mealy mass upon opening it. Never cut a baked potato. It 
makes it "soggy." 

Baked potatoes (No. 2) 

Pare and parboil ; then set in an open bakepan in the oven and 
bake about half an hour, basting freely with butter or dripping 
until you have a delicate brown "glaze" upon each. 



470 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

These may be eaten as a separate dish, or as a garnish for roast 
beef. 

Stuffed potatoes 

Bake eight large potatoes until done. Cut off the tops with a 
sharp knife and scoop out the insides with a small spoon. Set 
aside the skins for future use. With the back of a spoon mash 
the potatoes smooth, rub into them two tablespoonfuls of butter, a 
gill of cream, two teaspoonfuls of finely minced onion, a teaspoon- 
ful of minced parsley and salt and cayenne pepper to taste. When 
you have worked these ingredients to a smooth mass, beat in the 
stiffened whites of two eggs. Fill the empty potato skins with 
this creamy mixture, heaping it high. Stand the potato cases on 
end, side by side, in a baking-pan and set in the oven until the 
potato protruding from the tops is a delicate brown. 

Potatoes on the half-shell 

Bake large smooth potatoes, and cut each carefully in half 
lengthwise. Scrape out the insides, leaving the skins whole. Beat 
what you have taken out to a cream with melted butter, cream or 
milk, season with pepper and salt, and fill the "shells," rounding 
the potato on top. Put a dot of butter upon each and brown light- 
ly upon the upper grating of your oven. 

Potato souffle 

Into two cupfuls of mashed potato work three cupfuls of hot 
milk in which two tablespoonfuls of butter have been half melted. 
Beat out all the lumps until you have a smooth puree. Season with 
salt and pepper. Beat four eggs very light and whip them into 
the potato and milk. When thoroughly mixed pour into a deep 
greased pudding-dish and bake in a good oven until "set" and 
delicately browned. 

Potato croquettes 

Warm in a double boiler two cupfuls of mashed potatoes and stir 
into this two teaspoonfuls of butter and the beaten yolks of two 



DINNER VEGETABLES 471 

eggs. Add enough milk to make the paste of the right consistency 
to handle easily. With lightly floured hands form into croquettes 
and set aside to cool. When cold, dip in beaten egg and roll in 
cracker-dust. Set in the ice-box for several hours longer and fry 
in deep cottolene or other fat. 

Potato fritters 

Peel and boil four large potatoes, and when they are cold cut 
into tiny bits. Make a batter of two eggs beaten light a cupful 
of milk and a cupful and one-half of flour sifted twice with a half 
teaspoonful of baking-powder. Now add the minced potatoes, mix 
well and season with salt. Drop this mixture by the spoonful into 
deep, boiling cottolene or other fat. When the fritters are done lift 
them out with a perforated spoon, and lay them in a hot colander 
to drain free of fat. 

Scalloped potatoes 

Put a layer of sliced cold-boiled potatoes in the bottom of a 
buttered pudding-dish, sprinkle with crumbs and bits of butter. 
Put in another layer of potatoes and more crumbs until the dish 
is full, having the topmost layer of the buttered crumbs. Moisten 
all by pouring carefully into the dish a cupful of well-seasoned 
white stock. Bake for twenty minutes. 

Stewed potatoes (No. 1) 

Peel, cut into neat, small dice and lay in cold water for an hour. 
Put over the fire in boiling water, slightly salted, and cook ten- 
der. Turn off the water and pour in a large cupful of hot milk, 
in which you have stirred a pinch of scrda. Boil one minute and 
stir in a tablespoonful of butter rubbed into one of flour. Pepper 
and salt, add a tablespoonful of onion juice and a tablespoonful of 
minced parsley. Simmer for another minute, and serve. 

Stewed potatoes (No. 2) 

Peel potatoes and cut them into neat squares. Lay in cold 
water for an hour, drain, and put them over the fire in salted 



472 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

boiling water. Stew until they are tender, but not soft. Turn 
into a colander to drain. Cook together in a saucepan a heaping 
teaspoonful, each, of butter and browned flour, and pour upon 
them a pint of weak beef stock. When you have a smooth, thick 
sauce, season with pepper, salt and a little onion juice, and mix 
with the potato dice. 

Hashed and browned potatoes 

Pare, cut very small and evenly, and put into a saucepan with 
a finely minced onion and a stalk of celery chopped into tiny bits. 
Cover with salted boiling water and cook tender. Drain off the 
water, supplying its place with milk, heated with a pinch of soda. 
Bring to a bubble and stir in a large tablespoonful of butter, 
rubbed to a cream with one of flour. Pepper, salt, mix well but 
taking care not to break the potatoes take from the fire, stir and 
toss for a moment, then turn all into a greased pudding-dish, 
sprinkle crumbs on the top and brown in a good oven. 

Potatoes la duchesse 

Peel and boil enough potatoes to make a pint when mashed. 
Mix with them the yolk of an egg, two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter and the same quantity of cream. Turn this mixture upon 
a pastry-board and press it flat and smooth. With a sharp knife 
cut the potato' paste into squares of uniform size. Slip a cake- 
turner under each square and transfer it carefully to a greased 
baking-pan. Set in a cold place to stiffen, then sprinkle with 
grated Parmesan cheese, and bake in a quick oven to a delicate 
brown. 

Potatoes a la Lyonnaise 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into tiny dice of uniform size. Put two 
great spoonfuls of butter into the frying-pan and fry two sliced 
onions in this for three minutes. With a skimmer remove the 
onions and turn the potatoes into the hissing butter. Toss and 
stir with a fork that the dice may not become brown. When hot, 



DINNER VEGETABLES 473 

add a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley and cook a minute 
longer. Remove the potatoes from the pan with a perforated 
spoon, that the fat may drip from them. Serve very hot. 

Savory potatoes 

Heat in a double boiler a quart of milk and put into it three 
sliced onions. Boil for ten minutes, strain out the onions, return 
the milk to the fire, and stir into it two teaspoonfuls of butter 
rubbed into two of flour, and two teaspoonfuls of minced parsley. 
When the milk is as thick as cream, add to it two cupfuls of 
sliced cold boiled potatoes. Season with pepper and salt, and 
as soon as the potatoes are hot, pour all into a greased pudding- 
dish, sprinkle bread-crumbs over the top and bake until brown. 

Potatoes and corn 

(A "left-over.") 

Cut the kernels from six ears of boiled corn. Cut eight cold 
boiled potatoes into small dice of uniform size. Put into a frying- 
pan a tablespoonful of butter and turn the potatoes and corn into 
this ; salt and pepper. Fry, tossing and stirring constantly, for ten 
minutes. 

Fried potato hash 

Chop cold boiled potatoes, season with salt, pepper and onion 
juice. Have two tablespoonfuls of good dripping, hissing hot, in 
a frying-pan ; put in the potatoes and pat smooth. Cook slowly, 
turning the frying-pan occasionally that they may brown evenly 
on the bottom. In about twenty minutes they should be nicely 
colored and crusted into a thick sheet. Reverse carefully upon a 
hot platter. 

Brown creamed potatoes 

Cut eight potatoes into small dice of uniform size, boil tender 
in salted water, drain and stir into a pint of milk which has been 
thickened with a tablespoonful of flour rubbed into one of butter ; 
season. Turn all into a deep dish and bake until brown. 



474 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Potatoes with cheese sauce 

Boil a dozen potatoes and, while hot, mash soft with hot milk 
and melted butter, adding salt and white pepper to taste. Whip 
light and heap in the center of a fire-proof platter. Smooth the 
sides of the mound with a knife and carefully remove about a 
cupful of potato from the center of the mound, leaving a cavity 
in its place. Dip a feather or brush in the beaten white of an egg 
and wash the inside of the hollow and the top and sides of the 
mound with this. Now set in the oven to get very hot and to 
brown lightly. When done draw to the door of the oven and fill 
the hollow with the sauce made according to the following 
recipe sprinkle the potatoes and cheese with crumbs and return 
to the oven for five minutes before sending to the table. 

Sauce for the above 

Heat a cupful of milk with a generous pinch of soda; season 
with pepper, salt and onion juice, and thicken with a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter cooked to a roux with one of flour ; cook 
one minute and add three large spoonfuls of grated Parmesan 
cheese. 

Mashed potatoes 

Boil and mash white potatoes and whip to a cream with a cupful 
of hot milk and a tablespoonful of melted butter. Whip for 
fully five minutes with two forks, then pile upon a hot platter. 

Potato hillock 

Boil potatoes, dry at the back of the range, salting well, and 
rub through a vegetable press or colander upon a fire-proof plat- 
ter. As they fall let them form a conical hillock in the middle 
of the platter. Grate cheese thickly over the hillock and brown 
lightly upon the upper grating of your oven. 

Potatoes Parisienne 

Parisienne potatoes are cut into small balls from raw potatoes 
with a French vegetable cutter or a round spoon. They may be 
either fried, or boiled and served with maitre d'hotel sauce. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 475 

French fried potatoes 

Peel potatoes, cut into strips, and lay in iced water for at least 
an hour. Drain and pat dry between the folds of a clean dish- 
towel that should absorb every drop of moisture. Have ready a 
kettle of deep cottolene or other fat, heated gradually until it is 
boiling hot. Test this by dropping in a bit of the potato. It 
should rise to the top and brown immediately. Put in the pota- 
toes, fry to a golden brown, drain, first in a hot colander, then 
shake in heated tissue paper before transferring to a hot dish 
lined with a napkin. ' 

Saratoga chips 

Peel the potatoes and proceed as directed in preceding recipe 
when you have cut them into slices as thin as shavings. 

Potatoes an gratin 

Slice potatoes thin and put in layers in a greased pudding-dish, 
sprinkling each layer with salt, pepper and bits of butter. When 
all are in, pour in a gill of hot water or hot milk, and sprinkle the 
top layer of potatoes thickly with cracker-crumbs mixed with salt 
and pepper and bits of butter. Bake, covered, for half an hour. 
Uncover and brown. 

Potato omelet 

Make an omelet in the usual way ; have ready by the time it is 
done, and lay upon it, this mixture, then fold down : 

Cook one small minced onion in one tablespoon ful of dripping 
until yellow, add one cupful of cold boiled potatoes, chopped fine, 
and cook until slightly colored, stirring frequently. Shake into it 
a little pepper and salt and one teaspoonful of finely minced 
parsley. 

Set into the oven to keep warm until the omelet is ready. 

Potato dumplings (No. 1) 

Grate ten or twelve large raw potatoes. Put the grated pulp 
into a muslin bag and press out the juice. Turn into a bowl and 



476 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

add one-third as much boiled potato that has been run through a 
vegetable press. Salt to taste and beat in a raw egg until you 
have a smooth, creamy paste. Make into dumplings with well- 
floured hands, and roll each in flour to prevent them from sticking 
together while they are boiling. 

Have a pot of water at a hard boil, drop in the dumplings and 
cook from ten to twelve minutes. Test by taking one out and 
cutting in two to see if it is done in the center. Take up with a 
skimmer and serve at once, as they soon get heavy. 

Serve them with any kind of roast meat, or alone with gravy. 

Potato dumplings (No. 2) 

Peel medium-sized potatoes that have been partly boiled (not 
quite soft). When cold, grate ; to three parts of the potatoes take 
one part of grated wheat bread, and add small squares of wheat 
bread browned in butter, then crushed into crumbs. 

To each pint of the above add two eggs, well-beaten, two 
ounces of melted butter and nutmeg to suit taste. Mix all thor- 
oughly and form into round dumplings the size of an egg, or 
larger, as preferred. Roll in flour and boil in salted water until 
dry inside, or about fifteen minutes. 

Serve with roast meats. 

Always use mealy potatoes. 

Potato balls ("Kartoffelklosse") 
(A German recipe.) 

Peel, boil and mash potatoes ; put aside to cool. 

Three cupfuls of potatoes, one cupful of bread, two eggs, well- 
beaten, separately; pepper, salt and nutmeg to taste, and some 
chopped parsley that has been heated in butter. The bread should 
be prepared as for croutons, crusts removed, cut in squares, 
browned in butter in the oven, then crushed. The mixture should 
be very stiff. Mold into small balls and drop into boiling, well- 
salted water; keep water boiling for fifteen minutes, when the 
klosse should be about twice the original size and done to the cen- 



DINNER VEGETABLES 477 

ter. They may be served with bread-crumbs browned in butter, 
placed on the top of each dumpling, or with tomato sauce. With 
chopped meat filling the center of the dumplings they can also be 
varied. If too moist, use flour or bread-crumbs in molding. A 
good cook has the knack of dropping from the spoon without 
molding, but this is hard to do. The klosse should be the size of 
small apples when finished. Americans very often use a trifle of 
baking-powder to insure lightness in these. Germans depend on 
good beating. 

SWEET POTATOES 

Boiled sweet potatoes 

Wash and cook in boiling water until soft. Set in a moderate 
oven for ten minutes to keep them from being watery. 

Baked sweet potatoes 

They are seldom cooked in any other way at the South, where 
they are native to the soil, and at their best estate. 
Wash and wipe and bake in a good oven until tender. 

Glazed sweet potatoes 

Parboil in their skins, peel and lay in a bake-pan. Cook, basting 
often with butter, until they are a golden brown. 

Scallop of sweet potatoes and bacon 

This is a good "left-over" when you have a little cold corned 
ham and some cold boiled or baked sweet potatoes. Mince the 
meat the fatter the better and put a layer in the bottom of a 
bake-dish. Cover with sweet potato dice, pepper, and put in 
more bacon. When all the materials are used up, cover with 
crumbs ; add enough milk to wet the crumbs, cover and bake half 
an hour. Uncover and brown. 



478 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Sweet potatoes an gratin 

Parboil the potatoes, peel and slice while hot. Butter a deep 
dish well ; put in a layer of potatoes, sprinkle with sugar, salt, pep- 
per, and dot with butter ; then a stratum of fine crumbs ; season 
in the same way, leaving out the sugar. The uppermost layer 
should be of crumbs and well buttered. Pour in four tablespoon- 
fuls of warm water to generate steam, cover closely and bake 
half an hour. Uncover and brown. 

This is an especially nice dish for a family dinner, and always 
liked by children. 

Buttered sweet potatoes 

Boil sweet potatoes and peel them. Lay in a deep dish and 
upon each potato put a teaspoonful of butter. Set in the oven 
and heat until the butter sizzles about the edge of the dish. Then 
send to the table. 

Sweet potato croquettes 

Into two cupfuls of boiled and mashed -sweet potatoes beat a 
tablespoonful of butter, and stir in a saucepan over the fire until 
smoking hot. Now remove and add a tablespoonful of cream and 
the yolks of two eggs. When cold, form into croquettes and roll 
each croquette in beaten egg and cracker-crumbs. Arrange all on 
a platter and set in a cold place for several hours before frying 
in deep cottolene or other fat to a golden brown. 

Sweet potato puff 

Into two cupfuls of boiled and mashed sweet potatoes beat 
three whipped eggs, a cupful of milk, two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter and seasoning to taste. Beat hard and bake in a greased 
pudding-dish. 

Sweet potato and chestnut croquettes 

Boil and mash enough sweet potatoes to make two cupfuls, and 
enough Spanish chestnuts to make one cupful. Rub the nuts and 



DINNER VEGETABLES 479 

potatoes together while hot and beat into them two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, four teaspoonfuls of cream, two beaten eggs, and season 
to taste. When cold, form into croquettes, roll in egg and cracker- 
crumbs, and set in a cold place for an hour before frying in deep, 
boiling cottolene or other fat. 



RICE 

Boiled rice 

Into three pints of hot salted water, when at a fast boil, throw 
half a cupful of raw rice, previously washed and picked over. 
Keep it at a furious boil for twenty minutes, when test a grain to 
see if it is done. If it is soft, drain away every drop of water ; set 
the uncovered pot at the back of the range for two minutes to dry 
off the rice, and serve. Not a spoon should touch it while cook- 
ing, and each grain should be whole and apart from the rest. 

This, the one and only way to boil rice properly, is also the 
easiest. Shake the saucepan up three times while the rice is in 
cooking, to make sure it does not clog. 

Pasty rice is as abhorrent to those who have eaten it cooked 
according to this recipe as sodden, gluey potatoes. 

Serve in a hot, uncovered dish. Eat with butter, salt and pep- 
per, and you will not regret the tyrant potato, should he fail to 
appear. 

Buttered rice 

Spread three cups of cold boiled rice upon a platter and set in 
the open oven that every grain may dry. Meanwhile, heat a little 
butter in the frying-pan and fry a sliced onion in it. When the 
slices are browned remove them with a perforated spoon, and lay 
the rice by the spoonful in the pan. Stir until each grain is coated 
with the butter ; turn the rice into a heated colander, shake hard, 
and set at the side of the range for five minutes. Serve in a deep 
vegetable dish. 



480 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Eice croquettes 

Boil as directed in first recipe ; drain, and beat in two whipped 
eggs, half a cupful of milk (or cream if you have it), a little 
butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, a little mace, pepper and salt. Set 
by until perfectly cold, form into croquettes, roll in egg and fine 
crumbs, leave on ice for an hour and fry in boiling deep cottolene 
or other fat. 

You can make the croquettes of cold boiled rice if you have it, 
but it is hardly as good for the purpose as the hot. The croquettes 
seldom have the consistency of those made up while the rice is 
hot. 

Eice and tomato croquettes 

When the rice has boiled ten minutes drain off the water and 
cover the rice with tomato juice, already heated and seasoned 
with pepper, salt and sugar. Cook ten minutes more, or until 
the rice is tender. Take from the fire, add a great spoonful of 
butter and a teaspoonful of onion juice; the beaten yolks of three 
eggs, and, when you have beaten these in, two tablespoonfuls of 
grated Parmesan cheese. Set in a pan of boiling water and stir 
over the fire for five minutes. Turn out and let it get perfectly 
cold. Make into croquettes, roll in egg and cracker crumbs ; set 
on ice for an hour and fry in hot, deep cottolene or other fat. 
Drain and serve. 

Boiled rice with tomato sauce 

Boil in the usual way, dish, and pour over it, loosening with a 
fork that the sauce may penetrate to every part, a generous cup- 
ful of rich tomato sauce, seasoned with pepper, salt, onion juice 
and sugar, and, finally, with two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. 

Savory rice 

Prepare as in last recipe, but add a small cupful of good stock 
to an equal quantity of tomato sauce ; cook together for two min- 
utes and pour over the rice. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 481 

Rice pudding as a vegetable 

Boil one cupful of raw rice twenty minutes, or until soft, but 
not broken. Beat four eggs light, and when you have stirred a 
tablespoonful of butter into the rice add these and season with 
pepper and salt. Stir in, gradually, a scant quart of milk; beat 
all well for one minute, turn into a buttered pudding-dish and 
bake, covered, half an hour; then brown. 

It should be as light as a souffle, and must be eaten at once. A 
pleasing accompaniment to roast poultry of any kind. 

Savory rice pudding 

Boil and drain a cupful of rice. Stir into it, while hot, a table- 
spoonful of butter and a cupful of hot milk with which has been 
mixed a teaspoonful of corn-starch dissolved in cold water. Add 
a well-beaten egg, salt and pepper, and spread upon a platter to 
cool. Meanwhile make ready two cupfuls of chopped meat of 
almost any kind poultry, veal, lamb, mutton, beef, giblets, liver 
or a mixture of several whatever you have on hand. Chop 
half a can of mushrooms and work in; season highly with pap- 
rika, kitchen bouquet and onion juice. Some even put in a little 
curry. Moisten slightly with gravy and when the rice has cooled 
mix all well together. Butter a cake mold lavishly, put the pud- 
ding into it ; fit on a close top and set in a pot of boiling water. 
Cook steadily for at least two hours. Dip the mold into ice- 
water to loosen the pudding from the sides, and turn out upon a 
hot platter. 

Send tomato sauce, mixed with grated cheese, around with it, 
or any gravy you may chance to have left over. 

Molded rice (No. 1) 

Boil a cupful of raw rice ten minutes ; drain and pour over it, 
in place of the water, two cupfuls of chicken gravy or stock 
made from chicken, duck or turkey bones, seasoned well with 
salt, pepper and onion juice. Set in boiling water uncovered, 



482 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

and cook gently until quite dry. Turn into a bowl wet with hot 
water, press down firmly and reverse the bowl upon a hot platter. 
Cover the mound with grated cheese, brush all over with beaten 
white of egg, sift grated cheese upon the egg, and set upon the 
top grating of your oven to color slightly. 

Molded rice (No. 2) 

Boil a cupful of rice in plenty of hot salted water until soft. 
Drain and dry off. Stir into it a great spoonful of butter, a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice and the beaten yolks of two eggs, with 
salt and pepper to taste. Stir over the fire in a bowl set in boil- 
ing water for two minutes, using a fork that you may not break 
the rice to pieces. Turn into a round-bottomed bowl wet with 
cold water, and press down hard. Reverse the bowl upon a fire- 
proof platter, cover the molded rice thickly with a meringue 
made of the whites of the eggs beaten stiff, and set upon the top 
grating of the oven for three minutes to form. 

Eat with drawn butter. 

Spanish rice (very nice) 

Boil one cupful of rice until tender in plenty of boiling water, 
salted ; drain and dry off. Chop a quarter of a pound of fat salt 
pork, and fry in a pan. When it hisses put into the pan two 
medium-sized onions, also minced. Chop two green sweet pep- 
pers (seeded, of course), and mix with the rice, then the pork 
and onions, and enough tomato sauce to moisten the mixture well. 
Butter a bake-dish, add salt and pepper, if needed, to the rice, 
and put into the dish. Coat thickly with fine crumbs and bake, 
covered, for twenty minutes ; then brown. 

Bice timbales 

Pack hot boiled rice in slightly buttered timbaie molds; let 
them stand in hot water for ten minutes ; run a pointed knife 
around the sides; turn from the molds and serve as a garnish 
for curried meats or boiled fowl. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 483 



SALSIFY, OR OYSTER-PLANT 

Stewed salsify 

Scrape the roots, throwing them at once into cold water, that 
they may not blacken. Cut into inch lengths and put over the 
fire in boiling salted water. Stew until tender. Drain off the 
water and pour upon the salsify in the saucepan a cup of hot milk. 
After it has simmered five minutes add a tablespoonful of butter 
and three tablespoonfuls of cracker dust; season to taste and 
serve. 

Mock fried oysters 

Wash, trim and cook a bunch of oyster-plant (or salsify) in 
boiling salted water until tender. Drain and scrape ojff the skin. 
Mash well, and if stringy rub through a colander. 

To one pint of the mashed salsify add one teaspoonful of flour, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one well-beaten egg, and salt and 
pepper to season highly. Take up a small spoonful and shape it 
into an oval about the size of a large oyster ; dip each lightly in 
flour or very fine cracker-crumbs, and brown on each side in hot 
butter. 

Salsify fritters 

Scrape the salsify and grate it fine. If you have a machine for 
grinding vegetables, use that, as the process of grinding is so 
rapid that there is not time for the salsify to discolor before it is 
prepared. Have made a batter of two beaten eggs, a gill of milk, 
and salt to taste. Beat hard, and whip the grated salsify into 
this. Drop by the spoonful into deep, boiling cottolene or other 
fat. .When the fritters are of the right shade of brown, drain 
them quickly in a hot colander to free them of superfluous grease. 
Serve very hot. 

Scalloped salsify 

Wash and trim, but do not scrape fine roots of salsify. Boil 
in salted water until tender. Drain, scrape, clean and cut into 



484 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

inch lengths. Pack into a buttered bake-dish, alternately with 
thick white drawn butter, well seasoned, and fine bread-crumbs, 
seasoned and buttered. The top layer should be crumbs wet with 
cream. Cover closely and bake half an hour ; then brown deli- 
cately. 

Not a bad imitation of scalloped oysters. 



SPINACH 

"SPINACH is one of our most valuable vegetables. It contains 
salts and is slightly laxative. In order to retain all the nutritive 
value and the salts in the spinach it is best to cook in a steamer. 
It should be cooked just long enough to be tender, which is from 
ten to fifteen minutes. Spinach, if cooked too long, will lose 
its flavor and color." 

Thus writes an able authority upon dietetics. In three sen- 
tences we have here condensed the cardinal rules for preparing 
this queenly esculent for the use of the human animal. Opposed 
to one clause of the summary we have the story of a noted epicure 
who found spinach so much better when warmed up for the thir- 
teenth time that he ordered his cook to cook it thirteen times on 
the first day of serving. 

Boiled spinach, plain 

Pick over the spinach, rejecting all yellow or dried leaves. 
Wash in four waters, letting it soak in the last cold bath for three- 
quarters of an hour. Put into a large pot over the fire with just 
enough cold water to cover it. Cook for twenty minutes, or un- 
til tender. Drain in a colander, then turn into a wooden chop- 
ping-bowl and chop very, very fine. Return the spinach to the 
saucepan, stir into it a great spoonful of butter, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Mound the spinach on a hot platter, and garnish 
with slices of hard-boiled eggs. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 485 

Spinach a la creme 

Pick over and wash the spinach as in the last recipe. After 
soaking in the fourth water, put the leaves, with the moisture 
still clinging to them, into a large pot, and cover closely. The 
moisture on the leaves and the juice of the vegetables will form 
enough liquor to prevent scorching. Cook for twenty minutes, 
stirring well several times during the process. Sprinkle with 
salt and turn into a colander to drain. Press out the liquid, turn 
the spinach into a chopping-bowl and chop as fine as possible. 
Cook together in a saucepan one tablespoonful of flour and two 
of butter, and, when they are blended, pour the spinach upon 
them. Season and cook for several minutes, stirring constantly. 
Pour upon the spinach a small cupful of cream in which a pinch 
of soda has been dissolved, and cook three minutes longer, still 
stirring. Now add pepper and salt to taste and a pinch of nut- 
meg, and beat hard for three minutes. Serve smoking-hot, gar- 
nished with small triangles of toast. 

Spinach puff 

Boil as in the former recipe, chop "exceeding small," and beat 
in a tablespoonful of melted butter, salt, pepper and a pinch of 
nutmeg. Set aside until cool, then stir in a gill of cream, the 
whipped yolks of two eggs and the stiffened whites of three. 
Beat hard and turn into a deep, greased pudding-dish. Bake 
for twenty minutes, and serve at once. 

Spinach souffle 

Boil the spinach and chop fine. Add the beaten yolks of two 
eggs, a tablespoonful of melted butter, salt and pepper to taste. 
Set this mixture away to cool. When cold, beat into it a half- 
gill of cream and the frothed whites of three eggs. Turn into 
a buttered pudding-dish, and bake quickly in a hot oven to a light 
brown. Serve as soon as it is removed from the oven.

Spinach p&tes 

Boil the spinach, press out every drop of water and chop fine. 
Cook together in a saucepan a tablespoonful of butter and two 
of flour. Add the spinach with pepper and salt to taste ; cook for 
five minutes. Butter the insides of muffin-tins or pate-pans, and 
press the spinach hard into these. Set in the oven to keep hot 
while you make a white sauce. Carefully turn out the forms of 
spinach on a hot platter, lay a slice of hard-boiled egg on the top 
of each form and pour the white sauce around it. 



SQUASH 

THE summer squash differs from the winter variety in having 
a tender shell and in being very juicy. Both may be cooked in 
a variety of ways, and form many appetizing dishes. In open- 
ing the winter squash it is often necessary to exert great strength 
to break through the outer rind some housekeepers using a 
small saw for the purpose. The summer vegetable may be 
easily peeled or sliced with an ordinary case-knife. 

Boiled squash 

Wash two summer squashes, pare them, and cut into pieces 
about an inch square. Put them over the fire in a saucepan of 
boiling water and boil steadily for twenty-five minutes. Drain 
in a colander, pressing hard to extract the water, turn into a 
wooden bowl and mash with a potato-beater until free from 
lumps. Now beat in a heaping tablespoonful of butter; salt 
and pepper to taste. Return to the fire just long enough to get 
very hot, stirring all the time. Serve in a deep vegetable dish. 

Baked squash 

Peel, boil and mash two small squashes. When cold, beat in 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two whipped eggs, a gill of 
cream and salt and pepper to taste. Turn into a greased bake- 



DINNER VEGETABLES 487 

dish, sprinkle with bread-crumbs and bake for a half-hour. A 
good way to use squash left over from yesterday. 

Creamed squash 

Peel two summer squashes and cut into dice of uniform size. 
Boil for fifteen minutes in salted water, or until tender, but not 
broken. Drain carefully in a colander and keep hot while you 
cook together two heaping teaspoonfuls of butter and the same 
quantity of flour until they bubble ; then pour upon them a cupful 
and a half of sweet milk. Stir until smooth ; turn in the squash 
dice, season liberally with salt and white pepper, and serve. 

Scalloped squash 

Peel, wash and boil three summer squashes according to direc- 
tions given in the recipe for boiled squash. Beat two eggs light, 
and whip into them a small cupful of rich sweet milk, and a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Beat this mixture into the mashed 
squash, season with salt and pepper and turn all into a greased 
pudding-dish. Sprinkle with bread-crumbs and bits of butter, 
and bake. 

Squash pancakes 

Boil and mash two squashes, and when cold beat into them two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, 
a pint of milk, two eggs and a cupful of flour in which has been 
sifted a teaspoonful of baking-powder. Beat hard for five min- 
utes. Have a soapstone griddle heated, and drop the mixture by 
the spoonful on this. If the cakes are too stiff, add a little more 
milk. Serve hot with butter. These are good with broiled steaks 
or chops. 

Squash fritters 

Peel and slice the squash, and boil in salted water for a little 
over five minutes. Carefully remove the slices and drop into iced 
water. When cold, drain in a colander and pat dry between the 
folds of a dish-towel. Dip each slice in beaten egg, then in 



488 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

cracker crumbs, and when all are thoroughly coated set in a cold 
place for an hour. Have ready a kettle of boiling dripping; 
drop the squash slices .carefully into this and fry to a golden 
brown. Drain in a heated colander, sprinkle with pepper and 
salt, and serve. 

TOMATOES 

THE nineteenth century was a third gone before the world on 
this side of the sea began to appreciate the beneficent qualities of 
what our foremothers used to call "love apples." There is no 
other vegetable that is of more value as a liver regulator and 
blood-cooler than the tomato. The small quantity of calomel it 
contains acts as a corrective of biliousness, and stimulates all the 
secretions of the body to activity. Eaten raw, it is cooling and 
delicious, and it may be cooked in so many and varied forms 
that one does not soon weary of it. 

In the average home it appears as a salad, in soup, stewed, and 
perhaps baked or scalloped. When it has been thus served many 
housekeepers consider that they have exhausted its capabilities. 
On the contrary, they have hardly touched upon its possibilities. 

The increasing familiarity with sauces as the cook's potent aids 
in converting old dishes into new, has made tomato sauce popular 
as an accompaniment of certain compounds of macaroni, but 
even those who use the sauce in this manner do not all know 
how admirable it is served with boiled or baked fish, or with 
roast mutton, or as a vehicle for shrimps, or as a zest for eggs. 
Apart from this, the tomato, not made into a sauce, but employed 
either fresh or canned, may come to the table in a variety of 
easily-prepared and savory combinations that will appeal to the 
family caterer as being the new and inexpensive dishes she is 
always seeking. 

Raw tomatoes 

Never scald them. Pare and strip off the skins. Set on ice 
until you are ready to serve. Cut up quickly, lay within a chilled 
bowl and season, as you serve, with French dressing. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 489 

Raw tomatoes and cucumbers 

Cut off the tops of large, firm tomatoes and carefully remove 
most of the pulp. Keep pulp and tomatoes in the refrigerator 
while you peel and cut into small dice ice-cold cucumbers. Mix 
the cucumber dice with the tomato pulp, fill the tomato shells, set 
them on crisp lettuce leaves arid pour a great spoonful of mayon- 
naise dressing over each. 

Creamed tomatoes 

Cut firm tomatoes into thick slices and fry them until tender in 
a couple of "Spoonfuls of butter. Have ready a white sauce made 
by cooking together a tablespoonful, each, of butter and flour to 
the bubbling point, and then pouring upon them a half-pint of 
milk or, better still, a half-pint of mingled milk and cream. 
Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens, dish the to- 
matoes and turn the sauce upon them, after seasoning them suit- 
ably with pepper and salt. 

Stewed tomatoes 

Peel, slice and put a quart of tomatoes over the fire in a nickel- 
steel-plated or agate saucepan never in tin. Stew fast twenty 
minutes. Season with a lump of butter rolled in flour, a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, salt and pepper to taste, and two teaspoonfuls 
of onion juice. Stew five minutes longer, and serve. 

Some cooks substitute fine dry crumbs for the flour. Unless 
some thickening is used, the tomatoes will be watery and thin. 

Raw tomatoes and whipped cream 

Pare large, smooth tomatoes carefully, and set on ice until 
chilled to the heart. Cut each in half when ready to serve, 
sprinkle lightly with salt and paprika, and heap with whipped 
cream. 

A welcome entree in summer. Send around heated and but- 



490 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

tered crackers and cream cheese with them, or thin slices of but- 
tered graham bread. 

Tomato croquettes 

These can be made either of fresh or canned tomatoes. Rub 
through a colander half the contents of a can of tomatoes into a 
saucepan with a thin slice of onion, salt, pepper, two or three 
cloves, and one tablespoonful of sugar. Cook for fifteen min- 
utes, thicken with corn-starch four teaspoonfuls of it rubbed 
to a cream with a generous lump of butter. Let it boil up and 
add one egg. Pour the mixture out to cool. When cool, form 
into croquettes, and dip them, first, in beaten egg, then in fine 
crumbs; set on ice for two hours before frying in deep, boiling 
cottolene or other fat. 

Stuffed tomatoes (No. 1) 

Cut the tops from large, firm tomatoes, and with a small spoon 
scoop out the insides. To half of this pulp, chopped, add as 
much minced boiled ham and two tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, 
Season to taste and fill the tomatoes with this mixture. Set in a 
baking-pan and bake for twenty minutes, covered ; then brown. 

Stuffed tomatoes (No. 2) 

Cut the tops from large tomatoes and scrape out the pulp. Mix 
with this one part of bread-crumbs to two parts of minced boiled 
ham. Fill the tomato shells with this mixture, put a bit of but- 
ter upon the top of each, and set, side by side, in a bake-pan. 
Pour a cupful of soup stock over and around the tomatoes, and 
bake until tender. 

Scalloped tomatoes 

Grease a pudding-dish and put in the bottom of it a layer of 
peeled and sliced tomatoes. Cover with a layer of salted and 
peppered crumbs, sprinkle with bits of butter and a little sugar. 
Now put in another stratum of tomatoes and more crumbs. 
When the dish is full pour over all a cupful of well-seasoned 
soup stock, sprinkle the top with crumbs, and bake, covered, 
for fifteen minutes. Uncover and brown. 



DINNER VEGETABLES 491 

Tomatoes and corn 

Put a cupful, each, of stewed tomatoes and boiled corn over 
the fire together, bring to a boil, add half a teaspoonful of white 
sugar and, if you like, a dash of onion juice; cook one minute 
longer and serve. 

A good way of using yesterday's left-overs of these vegetables. 

Tomato fritters 

Make a batter of a cupful of flour, a cupful of water, a table- 
spoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of salt and the white of an egg. 
The water should be just warm enough to melt the butter, but 
not hot. Stir the two into the sifted and salted flour, mixing 
carefully, and, lastly, beat in the whipped white of an egg. Into 
the batter thus made dip rather thick slices of peeled tomatoes, 
and fry in deep hot fat to a light, delicate brown. The tomatoes 
may be sprinkled with salt and pepper before dipping them in 
batter, or the fritters may be seasoned after they are cooked. 

Tomatoes stuffed with meat 

Select large, firm tomatoes, cut off the tops and scoop out the 
inside pulp. Do not peel. Chop fine a cupful of cold meat it 
may be fowl, tongue or ham, or even lamb, mutton or beef, if the 
latter are well seasoned. With the meat put a half cupful of fine 
bread-crumbs, a tablespoonful of butter, and salt, pepper, parsley 
and onion juice. The quantity of these to be used must be de- 
termined by the amount of seasoning there is already in the meat. 
After sprinkling the inside of the tomato shells with a very little 
salt and pepper fill them with the mixture of meat, crumbs, etc. 
If this seems too dry it may be moistened with a small quantity 
of gravy or soup stock, or even with milk or cream. Arrange 
the tomatoes in a pudding-dish, replace the tops, lay a cover over 
them and bake half an hour. Serve in the dish in which they 
were cooked. 



492 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Tomatoes stuffed with corn 

Prepare the tomatoes as in the preceding recipe, place them in 
the bake-dish and fill them with a mixture of a cupful of grated 
green corn, half a cupful of bread-crumbs, a tablespoonful, each, 
of milk and butter, a teaspoonful of white sugar, and salt and 
pepper to taste. 

Tomatoes stuffed with rice 

Fill tomato shells prepared as above directed with cold boiled 
rice, to which have been added two tablespoonfuls of melted but- 
ter, half a teaspoonful of onion juice, salt and paprika. When 
the shells are filled strew the contents of each thickly with grated 
cheese before laying on the tops. Bake, covered, half an hour. 

Tomatoes stuffed with macaroni 

Prepare as in last recipe, substituting cold, boiled macaroni, 
chopped, for the rice, and mixing cheese with the filling, besides 
strewing it on the top. 

Tomatoes a la crime 

Cut unpeeled tomatoes into thick slices. Put into a frying- 
pan three tablespoonfuls of butter, and fry the tomatoes for three 
minutes in this, or until they are tender. Remove carefully and 
keep hot on a platter set in an open oven. Into the butter in the 
pan stir a tablespoonful of flour and cook until thoroughly blend- 
ed ; then pour in gradually a half-pint of rich milk in which a 
pinch of soda has been dissolved. Stir all to a smooth sauce, 
season and pour over the fried tomatoes. 



Tomatoes and poached eggs 

Cook tomatoes by either of the preceding receipes, or stew them 
until tender. If you do the latter, strain off the thin, watery 
liquor that comes from them in cooking, and set it aside for 
sauces or for seasoning. Make of the thick portion of the to- 



DINNER VEGETABLES 493 

mato a layer in the bottom of a platter, seasoning to taste with 
pepper and salt, and, if desired, with a few drops of onion juice ; 
make all very hot and lay on the bed thus prepared carefully 
poached eggs. If fried eggs are preferred, they may be substi- 
tuted. Dust them with a little salt and pepper and serve at once. 

Tomato omelet 

Peel and chop four tomatoes. Soak a cupful of bread-crumbs in 
a cup of milk and stir them into five beaten eggs. Add the 
chopped tomatoes, season to taste and turn into a frying-pan in 
which two tablespoonfuls of butter have been melted. Cook un- 
til set, turn upon a hot platter, pour tomato sauce about the ome- 
let, and send at once to the table. 

Curried tomatoes 

Put into a frying-pan a heaping tablespoonful of butter and 
half a small onion, grated. Cook until the latter begins to brown 
about two minutes and stir in a scant teaspoonful of curry 
powder. In this fry thick slices of tomato until tender, sprinkle 
with salt and serve. 

Another method of preparing curried tomatoes is to cook them 
by the recipe given for creamed tomatoes, adding a teaspoonful 
of curry powder to the cream sauce and pouring this over the 
fried tomatoes. 

Curried green tomatoes 

Cut large green tomatoes into very thick slices. Melt in a 
frying-pan three tablespoonfuls of butter and fry in this a small 
onion, sliced. At the end of two or three minutes stir into the 
melted butter a teaspoonful of curry powder. Lay the tomatoes 
in this mixture and fry them on both sides. When done, drain, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve.

TURNIPS 

Mashed turnips 

Peel, lay in cold water for an hour ; boil tender in hot, salted 
water; throw this off and fill up the pot with boiling water, 
slightly salted. Cook five minutes in this, drain well and rub 
through a colander or vegetable-press. Beat in a lump of butter 
rolled in a little flour, salt and pepper to taste ; return to the sauce- 
pan and cook one minute, stirring all the time. 

Turnips boiled, plain 

Pare and quarter. Cook tender in two waters ; drain, dish ; 
pour a little melted butter, seasoned with pepper and salt, over 
them, and serve hot. 

Young turnips stewed with cream 

Pare, lay in cold water one hour ; cook tender in two waters ; 
drain and cover with hot cream (heated with a pinch of soda) or 
hot milk, if you have no cream. Simmer gently for five minutes ; 
stir in a white roux made by cooking together a tablespoon ful of 
butter and one of flour, salt and pepper, and serve very hot. 

Young turnips with white sauce 

Peel, lay in cold water for an hour; boil for ten minutes in 
fresh water, cover with boiling, slightly salted water, and cook 
tender. Drain, dish, season and pour over them a good white 
sauce of drawn butter. 

Fried turnips 

Peel and slice young turnips, dropping them into cold water as 
you do so. Turn into a pot of boiling water, and cook for twenty 
minutes. Drain carefully, so as not to break the slices. When 
cold, dip each slice in beaten egg, then in salted cracker dust, and 



DINNER VEGETABLES 495 

spread all upon a platter. Let them stand for an hour and fry in 
deep, boiling fat to a golden brown. 

Turnips and carrots sautes 

Peel and cut into dice of uniform size enough cold boiled 
turnips and carrots to make a cupful of each. Mix and sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in a fry- 
ing-pan and turn the vegetable dice into this. Toss and turn in 
the hissing butter for five or ten minutes ; drain in a hot colander 
and dish. 

Kohlrabi turnips 

Separate the turnip of the vegetable from the leaves that sur- 
round it and wash thoroughly. Cut into quarters and boil for 
twenty minutes in salted water. Drain ; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and serve hot with melted butter. 

Kohlrabi with leaves 

Remove the outer leaves from the swelled stalk, or turnip ; 
wash thoroughly and throw into cold water. Drain both and 
put them on to boil in separate vessels of salted water. When 
the turnips have cooked for ten minutes, drain and pour over 
them fresh boiling water, to which a tablespoonful of vinegar has 
been added. Boil for ten minutes longer; drain, scrape and 
slice. Dip the slices, one by one, in melted butter and -lay about 
the edge of a hot platter. Drain the leaves which have been 
cooked tender, turn into a chopping-bowl and chop very fine. 
Return to the fire with two tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper and 
salt to taste. Beat to a smoking mass, and heap in the center 
of the heated platter, about the edge of which you have laid the 
sliced vegetable.

A WORD ABOUT NUTS 

NUTS of all kinds are gaining in favor as articles of diet, and 
are at their best in the autumn and winter. They may be bought, 
shelled and packed in boxes, so that they are ready for imme- 
diate use. The housekeeper of moderate means, with an abun- 
dance of time at her disposal, will find that it is cheaper to buy 
the nuts in their shells and crack them herself. If she is so for- 
tunate as to be able to despise the petty economies she will re- 
joice in the prepared nuts. They will save her much tedious 
labor. 

If Spanish chestnuts are not to be procured when wanted, large 
domestic chestnuts may be boiled and used in their stead. 

Chestnut croquettes 

Boil a quart of Spanish chestnuts in salted water. While still 
hot, remove the shells and skins and rub the nuts through a 
colander. With a wooden spoon work to a smooth paste, add- 
ing, as you do so, a tablespoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of salt, 
a dash of paprika, a quarter of a teaspoonful of onion juice, a 
handful of fine bread-crumbs, and the unbeaten yolk of an egg. 
Put the paste in a double boiler over the fire and heat through. 
With floured hands form into croquettes, dip in beaten egg, then 
in cracker dust, and lay on a platter in the refrigerator for two 
hours. Fry in deep, boiling cottolene or other fat; drain in a 
colander, and serve very hot. 

English walnut croquettes 

Crack, extract the kernels, blanch by pouring boiling water 
over them, stripping off the loosened skins and dropping into 
cold water. Leave there for ten minutes ; take out, dry between 
two soft towels and, when crisp and perfectly dry, proceed as 
with chestnuts in last recipe.

Peanut stuffing for roast duck 

Prepare the ducks for roasting and make a stuffing of bread- 
crumbs seasoned with butter, pepper and salt. Chop a cupful of 
roasted and shelled peanuts to a powder and rub them into the 
bread-crumbs. Stuff the ducks with this mixture and roast, bast- 
ing frequently. 

Parsnips 

Boil parsnips in slightly-salted water until tender. Drain and 
scrape. Slice them from end to end and put into a frying pan 
with a little melted butter. Cook until very hot, sprinkle with 
salt, pepper, and a little minced parsley, and send to the table. 



EVEN-THREADED LIVING 

"COME what may, appearances must be kept up!" wrote a 
venerable gentlewoman to her daughter, with whom life had 
grown suddenly hard by reason of her husband's pecuniary losses. 
"Show a brave front to the world although there may be an 
empty purse and an empty larder behind it. Noblesse oblige!" 

The motto is grand sometimes sublime. 

There is an heroic side to the question, of which I shall treat 
presently. 

The ignoble side, and that which forms the basis of most 
treatises on this subject, crops up when appearances are all in all, 
and make the life a continual lie, like an embroidered silk stock- 
ing drawn over an unwashed foot. 

One of my childish recollections is of a rich woman, whose 
"pair of parlors," as she called them, were richly carpeted, cur- 
tained and furnished, as was also a spacious dining-room on the 
same floor. When there was no company the family sat in a 
back room adjoining the kitchen. The worthy woman, visiting 
a sister-housewife, was scandalized at learning that she, her hus- 
band and six children actually used the parlors "every day and 
Sunday, too," and ate habitually in a dining-room "where there 
was an elegant Brussels carpet on the floor." 

"My dear Mrs. Blank !" cried the wealthy economist, "do you 
expect to have all this and heaven, too?" 

"I expect to enjoy heaven the more for having made the best of 
the Father's gifts to me here," answered the matron of advanced 
ideas. 

Ideas, which I record with devout gratification, are fast rele- 
gating to a dusty and dishonored past, the "best room" of farm- 
house and town mansion never opened except for visitors. With 

498 



EVEN-THREADED LIVING 499 

it is going the basement sitting-room, "low" in every sense of the 
word, which used to be thought good enough for the family. Ex- 
pensive furniture, kept with real china and solid silver for "occa- 
sions" that is, when appearances must be kept up before com- 
parative strangers and acquaintances for whom, taken as in- 
dividuals, the appearance-worshipers care less than nothing; fine 
clothes, worn above mean undergarments; sounding phrases 
aired, like the reserve of linen sheets, for company use have 
more influence upon character than we are willing to believe. It 
is well to put the best foot foremost. It is better to have both 
feet decently shod and alike serviceable. Each of us knows 
plenty of people who have company tones, company smiles, com- 
pany phraseology, company opinions zmwisely kept for show. 
One and all, singly and collectively, they mean to imply something 
which the wearers thereof are not. Their "appearances" are so- 
cial electroplating, moral veneering. Slipshod at home and 
every day; well-groomed abroad and in the sight of those to 
whom it makes not an atom of difference how the hypocrites look 
or act, "home devils and street angels," as plain-spoken critics 
style them, such is the great host of those who keep up ap- 
pearances because they have not souls above shams, whose 
dusters and mops never visit the insides of burnished cups and 
platters. Verily they have their reward, but the prizes are as 
ignoble as the recipients and their motives. 

We see, or may see, if we use our senses aright, the heroic side 
of the question. My heart aches with the thought of scores of 
examples which pass under my eyes in the lives of unknown 
martyrs of whom this world is not worthy, by whom the world 
to come will be made the worthier abiding-place of those for 
whom the Father has prepared it. 

An old woman, who knew the Bronte sisters as children and 
women, told me that their body linen was darned by a thread un- 
til the original fabric hardly showed between the mending. 

"But it was always whole and clean, and they ma.de it as care- 
fully as if it were to be trimmed with real lace. Nobody ever saw 
a rip in their gloves, and they cleaned them themselves. They 
looked like the ladies they were. Not a bit fashionable, but 



500 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

downright ladylike, you know. They always kept themselves 
up." 

I heard another "downright ladylike" girl, who is almost as 
poor as the Yorkshire sisters were, insist, the other day, upon 
dressing for the family dinner when the relative with^whom she 
lived begged her not to change her walking costume. 

"You are so tired, my dear, after teaching all day !" 

"We working women can not take such liberties with our- 
selves," said the spirited heroine. "If we let the forms of ele- 
gant propriety and conventionality go, we are in danger of for- 
getting what they represent." 

Of a like strain was the regard for appearances that led young 
Ellsworth, who was killed early in the Civil War, decline an in- 
vitation to dine with a business acquaintance at a restaurant when 
Ellsworth was so hungry that the smell of the food made him 
almost frantic. He was then a poor student working his way 
through a New York law school. In referring to the incident in 
more prosperous days, Colonel Ellsworth explained that he could 
not have accepted a courtesy he would not be able to repay in 
kind. 

"A gentleman may starve without loss of caste," he added. 
"He forfeits his right to the name in becoming a pauper, or a 
beggar." 

The outward appearance was the sign of the inward grace, 
inbred and invincible. 

True refinement the kind that does not shrink or go to pieces 
under the roughest processes of the mangle we know as daily 
living is "even-threaded" and consistent throughout. 

I called the other day upon a woman who has never been rich, 
but always refined. She is now poor. She can never be com- 
mon. Her lunch hour was earlier than I had supposed, and my 
call infringed upon it. She and her daughter were at table. 

"You shall not go," she insisted ; "I can give you a cup of hot 
tea and little else besides 'bread and cheese and kisses.' The 
welcome must make up the rest." 

The cheese had been melted upon buttered toast, cut by a tin 
"shape" into scalloped ovals ; it was golden brown in color, crisp

SUGGESTION FOR A SUNFLOWER LUNCHEON

to the teeth, savory to the palate. The tea was scalding and 
fresh and fragrant ; for meat we had three Hamburg steaks, gar- 
nished with celery-tops. They were accompanied by an apple- 
and-celery salad, treated on the table to a French dressing; 
wafery slices of brown bread and butter went with it. After- 
wards we had Albert biscuits and a second cup of tea and noth- 
ing else. Beyond the laughing remark prefacing the frugal meal, 
the hostess offered no apology. She lived in this style every day, 
affecting nothing and hiding nothing. A gentlewoman in grain, 
if she had sat down to three meals a day alone, she would have 
breakfasted, lunched and dined not merely "fed." Luxury was 
beyond her reach elegance never. 

Simplicity need not be homely. Neatness is not a synonym 
for bareness. A certain degree of beauty and grace is almost 
a Christian duty. 

The best cooks can not afford to despise the recommendation 
of the eye to the palate. The difference between plain and dainty 
housekeeping depends so much upon it that the professional 
caterer plays cunningly upon the desire of the eye, often bringing 
a good thing into disrepute. Because his garnishes and fanciful 
devices conceal cheap materials and indifferent manufactures is 
no reason why the housekeeper should not make the substantial 
"home fare" provided by her honest hands goodly to sight, as 
well as to taste. 

Cooking schools and classes, chafing-dish lectures and the 
cuisine corner of the woman's page have been active for more 
than a third of a century to bring our average American house- 
wife to what old-time revivalists called "a realizing sense" of 
the deficiencies of the national kitchen, and by the rugged road 
of conviction to conversion from the old way to the new, which 
is the better. There is no dearth of missionaries, no lack of 
machinery. 

Much of the work done by these is surface culture scratching 
and smoothing over the soil, cleansing, to a polish, cup and plat- 
ter. Curled parsley, beets, carrots and turnips, carved into 
leaves, stars and flowers, and fantastic confections of tissue paper 
and meringue do not cheat veterans in gastronomies into relish 



502 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

of the ill-prepared dishes they adorn. Experiences of this sort 
have something to do with the contempt felt by many competent 
cooks for culinary esthetics. They class everything that looks in 
this direction under the head of "French cookery/' a synonym 
with them for flash and frippery. 

I grant that to the hale appetite of the lover of "plain roast 
and boiled" of joints, haunches and rounds the man who can 
digest mountains of fried "griddles," and, in the bottom of his 
stomachic conscience, prefers corned beef and cabbage to broiled 
sweetbreads and mushrooms his steak, or rare roast, or sugar- 
cured ham, or choice cut of cod, tastes no better for the garnish 
of cress, nasturtium or lemon. I once saw a millionaire "high- 
liver" toss aside the green sprays with the declaration that he 
"liked to have victuals and weeds sent in upon separate dishes." 
After clearing the trou trencher ! he proceeded to feed. 

In the feeder's very teeth I maintain that food daintily served 
tastes better than the same when set before us with no regard to 
seemliness. If slender appetites are to be coaxed into action, the 
study of pleasing effects becomes an obligation. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 
PIES 

Pastry 

Have all ingredients very cold. Into a pound of flour chop 
three-quarters of a cup of firm, cold butter. When the flour is 
like a coarse powder stir into it a small cupful of iced water. With 
a spoon mix together, then turn upon a floured pastry-board, roll 
out quickly and lightly, fold and roll out again. Set the pastry 
on the ice until chilled through, roll out and line a pie-dish with 
it. Before filling the pastry shell with fruit, or other material 
of which the pie is to be made, wash over the lower crust with 
the unbeaten white of an egg, and, when the filling is put in, set 
the pie immediately in an oven that is as hot at the bottom as at 
the top. The oven must be hot and steady. 

A good puff paste 

Into a half-pound of flour chop six ounces of firm, cold butter, 
and, when like a coarse powder, wet with a small cupful of iced 
water. Stir to a paste and turn upon a chilled board. Roll out 
quickly and lightly, handling as little as possible. Fold and roll 
out three times, then set on the ice for several hours before mak- 
ing into pies. Always bake pastry in a very hot oven. 

Family pie crust 

Sift a quart of flour three times with one teaspoonful of bak- 
ing-powder. Chop into it two tablespoonfuls of cottolene or 
other fat until it is like granulated dust. Wet with iced water 

503 



504 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

into a stiff dough, handling as little as you can, using a wooden 
spoon until it is too stiff to manage. Turn upon a floured board 
and roll out thin. Have ready two tablespoonfuls of firm butter, 
and with this dot the paste in rows one inch apart, using one 
tablespoonful of butter. Roll up the sheet of paste, inclosing the 
butter ; beat flat with the rolling-pin, and roll out as before. Use 
the other tablespoonful of butter in dotting this sheet, sprinkle 
lightly with flour, and roll up tightly. Give a blow or two of the 
pin to hold it in fold, and set on the ice until you are ready to 
use it -all night if you like. It is better for three or four hours' 
chilling. 

Butter the pie-plates, lay the crust lightly within them ; pinch 
the edges to hinder it from "crawling" while baking, fill with 
fruit, or whatever else is to go into them. If this is to be what 
a witty editor designates as "the kivered pie which stands high 
in the royal family of Pie," lay the paste neatly over the filling, 
trim off ragged edges, and press or print down the edges. 

A North Carolina man thus separates the "royal family" afore- 
said : "There are three varieties : kivered, unkivered and barred." 

The New York editor, just quoted, says of the "kivered" va- 
riety : 

"Its triumphant composition requires of the artist higher 
qualities of head and heart, a more delicate touch, a higher strain 
of genius, a sublimer imagination, than the composition of the 
unkivered, or the barred. There must be magic in the upper 
crust of it. Ah ! that delicious, finely-flaking upper crust, de- 
signed by a deep-revolving brain and fashioned by a sensitive 
hand, a pate Queen Mab would be glad to nibble !" 

On the other hand, a New Orleans knight of the pen boldly 
defines the kivered pie as "distinctively a product of New England 
civilization, that has no place in simpler and more democratic 
states. Descendants of the men who made the charge up King's 
Mountain, the Majuba Hill of this continent, take their pie un- 
kivered. They will not touch the kivered abomination !"

Mince pie 

Returning to our New York editorial, the amused reader finds 
this eulogium upon mince pie : 

"There goes much skill to the making of a mince pie. Within 
the fortunate inwards of the president of pies are strange dain- 
ties and spices, and Dr. Johnson's drink of heroes. The elements 
are so mixed in it that nature may stand up and say to all the 
world : This is a pie! A great mince pie is a masterpiece !' " 

An anonymous writer upon the same subject says for the 
comfort of semi-dyspeptics : 

"Mince-meat ought to be extremely wholesome for the same 
reasons that make it good to eat its flavors of sweet and sour, 
of meat, apple and spice, which relieve each other, and its finely 
divided particles which allow the choicer blending of flavors and 
save the stomach much of the grinding work which reduces food 
to the pulp in which it enters the blood. What gives mince pie 
its ill repute as the very spawn of nightmare, are its overdressing 
with suet and butter, only fit for polar consumption, and its drug- 
ging with spices. Spice is the very food of the nerves, rightly 
used, growing more essential as circulation and sense dull with 
age. But it should be delicately, discerningly used not to lose 
its potency. The overdressing with fat is a relic of the old 
English barbarism which stewed its food in tallow, and, as the 
old play has it, 'took two fat wethers to baste one capon/ " 

Mince-meat 

(A family recipe 150 years old.) 

Boil two pounds of lean beef, and when cold, chop fine. Mince 
a pound of beef suet to a powder. Peel and chop five pounds of 
apples. Seed and halve two pounds of raisins. Wash, and pick 
over carefully two pounds of cleaned currants and one pound of 
sultana raisins. Cut into tiny bits three-quarters of a pound of 
citron. Mix these ingredients, adding, as you do so, two table- 
spoonfuls, each, of cinnamon and mace, a tablespoonful, each, of 
cloves and allspice, a teaspoonful of ground nutmeg, a tablespoon- 



506 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

ful of salt and two and a half pounds of brown sugar. When all 
is well mixed, stir in a quart of sherry and a pint of the best 
brandy. Mix thoroughly and pack down in a stone crock. 

Mince-meat should be prepared several weeks before it is 
needed, that it may "ripen" and become mellow. Those whose 
temperance principles forbid the moistening of the mince-meat 
with brandy or sherry, may use cider in their place. In making 
mince pies have the best puff-paste. Line pie-plates with this, 
fill the crust shells with the mince-meat, and lay strips of pastry, 
lattice-wise, across the tops of the pies. Bake in a good oven, 
which should be as hot at the bottom as at the top. The pies may 
be kept for weeks, but must be reheated before serving. 

Our New Orleans essayist upon the national pie, is cavalierly 
disdainful in throwing aside the third variety : 

"The barred pie may be dismissed without discussion, being a 
mere compromise, a pabulum for colorless individuals who are 
the mugwumps of the dining-room." 

In defiance of the slur, I commend my "barred" mince pie, with 
its latticed cover, as the pearl of the royal race. For a century 
and a half, the Old Virginia housewives, from whom I proudly 
claim descent, laid the dainty trellis across the heaving brown 
breast of the masterpiece, and six generations of epicures have 
set thereon the seal of their approval. 

Pumpkin pie (No. 1) 

Belongs to the noble order of the "unkivered" pie. 

Add the beaten yolks of four eggs and one cupful of white 
sugar to two cupfuls of pumpkin that has been stewed and put 
through a colander. With this mix a quart of milk, one tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, mace and nutmeg mixed, and the whites 
of the eggs, beaten stiff. Line a very deep pie-dish with a good 
paste, cut slashes in it here and there, stir the pumpkin custard 
well from the bottom and put it into the pastry. Bake in a steady 
oven. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 507 

Pumpkin pie (No. 2) 

Into a quart of stewed and strained pumpkin stir a quart of 
milk, a cup of granulated sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, 
and, last of all, five eggs, well beaten. Mix thoroughly, and pour 
the mixture into a deep pie-plate lined with puff paste. Bake in 
a good oven until the pumpkin custard is "set." Eat cold. 
Canned pumpkin is used in the same way and is almost as good 
as the fresh. 

Lemon cream pie (No. 1) 

Heat a quart of milk and ^tir into it one-third of a cupful of 
prepared flour wet with a little cold milk. Let this get hot, stir- 
ring all the while. Beat the yolks of five eggs light with five 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and add the milk and flour to this. Let 
all cook together for one minute after th|y come to the simmer ; 
take from the fire and add the juice and grated peel of a large 
lemon. Bake in open shells of puff paste, and, as soon as the 
custard is set, cover it with a meringue made of the whites of 
the five eggs beaten stiff with three tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar. Brown lightly and serve cold. 

Lemon cream pie (No. 2) 

Cream a tablespoonful of butter with a cupful of sugar ; dissolve 
a heaping tablespoonful of corn-starch in a gill of cold water, 
and stir it into a cupful of boiling water. Stir until smooth ; then^ 
pour over the sugar and butter. Mix well and when cool stir in 
the grated rind and the juice of a large lemon, and one beaten 
egg. Line a pie-plate with puff paste, fill with this mixture and 
bake. When done, cover with a meringue, and return to the 
oven just long enough to brown lightly. 

Lemon pie with crust 

Beat two eggs light and stir into them two cupfuls of sugar ; add 
a pint of water, three tablespoonfuls of cracker-dust, the same 
quantity of flour rubbed to a paste with a little cold water, the 



508 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

grated rind of one, and the juice of two lemons. Beat hard, add 
a pinch, each, of cinnamon and nutmeg, and turn the mixture into 
pie-plates lined with pastry. Cover with an upper crust, cut 
gashes in this for the escape of the steam, and bake in a steady 
oven for forty minutes. 

Crustless lemon pie 

Soak a cupful of crumbs for an hour in a little milk. Cream to- 
gether a half-cupful of sugar and half as much butter, whip into 
them the beaten yolks of three eggs and the white of one, reserv- 
ing the other whites for the meringue. Now add the juice and 
grated rind of two lemons, then the soaked crumbs. Line a large 
pie-plate with puff paste, pour in the lemon mixture and bake to 
a golden brown. Make a meringue of the stiffened whites and 
two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Draw the pie to the 
door of the oven, spread with the meringue and return it to the 
oven just long enough to brown it delicately. Eat cold. 

Cocoanut pie 

Cream a half-cupful of butter with two scant cupfuls of pow- 
dered sugar, and when very light add half a grated cocoanut and 
a generous tablespoonful of rose-water. Now "fold" in quickly 
and lightly the stiffened whites of six eggs, turn into a deep pie- 
dish lined with puff paste and bake in a quick oven. Eat cold with 
powdered sugar and whipped cream flavored with rose-water. 
This is delicious. 

When it is possible to do so buy the fresh cocoanut and grate 
it. The prepared or desiccated article put up in boxes may be 
used as a makeshift. It can never be a worthy substitute for the 
fresh and juicy nut. 

Chocolate pie (No. 1) 

Make a custard by pouring two cupfuls of scalding milk grad- 
ually upon three eggs that have been beaten well with four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. Return to the fire, stir in a half-cupful of 
grated sweet-chocolate, remove from the fire, add a teaspoonful of 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 509 

vanilla, and pour the mixture into a pie-plate lined with puff paste. 
Bake until "set." 

Chocolate pie (No. 2) 

One pint of milk ; one cupful of sugar ; yolks of two eggs ; two 
tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate. Mix, and bake in an open 
crust. Make a meringue of the whites of the eggs and a table- 
spoonful of sugar and spread on the top of the pie to brown. 

Orange pie 

Rub to a creamy paste a half-cupful of butter and a cupful of 
granulated sugar. Beat light the yolks of four eggs, whip them 
into the butter and sugar, add the juice and a quarter of the grated 
peel of a large orange, a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and the 
stiffened whites of two eggs. Line a pie-plate with light puff 
paste and turn the orange mixture into this. Bake until the fill- 
'ng is set and the crust lightly browned. Beat the whites of two 
2 SS S light with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. When 
the pie is done, draw it to the door of the oven, spread it with 
this meringue, and return to the oven just long enough to color 
the meringue delicately. Eat cold. 

Custard pie 

Whip light the yolks of three eggs with four tablespoonfuls 
of sugar. Pour upon them two cupfuls of boiling milk, stirring 
this in slowly. Flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla. Line a pie- 
plate with paste, brush the inside with the white of an egg, pour 
in the custard and bake. 

Sliced apple pie 

Line a deep pie-dish with good puff paste. Put into this peeled 
and cored and thinly-sliced apples ; sprinkle thickly with sugar 
and squeeze a few drops of lemon juice upon them. Add more 
sliced apple, more sugar, a little more lemon, and proceed in this 
way until the dish is full. Cover with a round of puff paste, 



510 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

pinch together the edges of the upper and lower crusts, and cut 
several slits in the upper to allow the steam to escape. Bake in 
a steady oven to a golden brown, covering the pie with paper 
for the first ten minutes. 

Creamed sweet apple pie 

Pare, core and quarter Campfield pound sweets, or other sweet 
apples. Put them into a pudding-dish with a few spoonfuls of 
water to prevent burning, cover closely and cook until tender, 
but not broken. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar to each cupful 
and let .them get cold in the syrup. Then cut into thin slices or 
tiny dice. Roll out some puff paste quite thin ; line a pie-plate, 
sprinkle with flour, lay on another crust and bake until brown. 
When ready to serve, open the crusts, spread the lower one with 
the stewed apple, cover with whipped cream, put on the top 
crust and sprinkle that with powdered sugar. 

Creamed apple-sauce pie 

Bake your crusts as directed in preceding recipe. When you 
separate them, spread with well-sweetened apple-sauce beaten 
light; cover with whipped cream; lay on the upper crust and 
sprinkle powdered sugar on top. 

In both of these recipes you may substitute a meringue of 
frothed whites, slightly sweetened, for the cream, spreading the 
same upon the top crust. 

Apple meringue pie 

Slice and stew ripe, tart apples ; run through the colander or 
vegetable press into a bowl. Sweeten plentifully, and beat in, 
while hot, a tablespoonful of butter. Have ready buttered pie- 
plates lined with puff paste ; when the sauce is cold fill these 
shells with it and bake until very lightly browned. Cover with 
a meringue, slightly sweetened and flavored with vanilla or other 
essence ; set in a hot oven and bake until the meringue begins to 
color. Sift powdered sugar over all. Eat cold. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 511 

Peach meringue pie 

Stew and rub peaches through a colander or a vegetable press. 
Sweeten to taste, and when cold, proceed as directed in last recipe. 
They are very nice. 

Whole peach pie 

Line a deep pie-plate with pastry, and lay in it as many whole 
peeled peaches as it will hold. Strew thickly with sugar; fit on 
an upper crust and bake to a golden brown. Eat with powdered 
sugar and cream. 

Creamed peach pie (No. 1) 

Peel, stone and halve ripe peaches. Line a deep pie-plate with 
puff paste, and lay the peaches in this. Sprinkle thickly with 
sugar, and fit on an upper crust. Have ready and cold, a cream 
sauce. To make this, scald a half-pint of milk and thicken it with 
a tablespoonful of corn-starch rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. 
Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and the frothed white of one 
egg. Boil together for five minutes and set aside to cool. When 
the pie is done carefully lift the top crust and fill the pie to over- 
flowing with the cream sauce. Replace the crust and set in a 
cool place. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and eat very cold. 



Creamed peach pie (No. 2) 

Bake as above, stoning the peaches and cutting each in half. 
While hot, insinuate the blade of a knife between upper and lower 
crust, to loosen them. Let the pie get cold; lift the crust and 
spread whipped cream upon the peaches. Cover again, strew 
powdered sugar upon the top crust and eat. 

Creamed raspberry pie 

Line a pie-dish with good pastry and fill it three-quarters full 
of red raspberries strewed with granulated sugar. Cover with 
an upper crust, but rub the edges of this and of the lower crust 



512 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

with butter to prevent their sticking together. Make a cream of 
a cupful of hot milk thickened with a teaspoonful of corn-starch 
wet with cold milk. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of sugar, remove 
from the fire, and when cool whip in the stiffened whites of 
three eggs. When the pie is done and is cold, lift off the upper 
crust and cover the raspberries with the "cream." Replace the 
cover and sift powdered sugar over it. 

Cherry pie 

Many persons make a cherry pie without stoning the cherries. 
That stoning them is a trouble is not to be denied, but the result 
is so satisfactory that it really seems worth while to take the 
pains to accomplish it. In stoning cherries, use a sharp knife 
and save all the juice. Grease a deep pie-dish and line it with 
good puff pastry. Fill the pastry shell with the cherries and the 
juice that flowed from them in the stoning process. Cover with 
a thin crust, cut slits in this for the escape of the steam, and bake. 
Eat cold. 

Cranberry pie 

Seed a cupful of raisins and chop them into bits. Cut into 
halves two cupfuls of cranberries and mix them with the minced 
raisins. Add two even cupfuls of sugar, a cupful of water, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour and a few drops of lemon juice. Line 
deep pie-plates with puff paste; fill each with the mixture, put 
on a thin upper crust and cut slits in this for the escape of the 
steam. Bake in a good oven to a golden brown. When cold, 
sprinkle with sugar. 

Cranberry and raisin pie 

Seed and mince one cupful of raisins ; mix with two cupfuls 
of cranberries halved, a half cupful of water and a cupful of 
sugar. Stir one teaspoonful of flour with the sugar and mix 
all well. Fill shells of pastry laid in buttered plates with this 
mixture, called by some "mock cherry pie," lay strips of crust 
cut with a jagging-iron over the top and bake. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 513 

Strawberry pie 

Line a buttered plate with puff paste, wash with white of egg 
and fill with ripe strawberries capped and washed. Sweeten 
plentifully, cover with another crust ; cut slits in this, and bake. 

Currant pie (No. 1) 

Mix ripe and stemmed currants with one cupful of sugar to 
two of currants, and bake between upper and lower crusts. Strew 
white sugar over the top and eat cold. 

Currant pie (No. 2) 

Fill a pastry shell with one cupful of ripe currants, cleaned 
and stemmed. Pour upon them an egg, beaten light with one-half 
cupful of sugar. Lay another crust over the currants and bake. 

New England blueberry pie 

Wash and dredge blueberries with flour; then scatter among 
them half a cupful of sugar for each pint of berries. Fill paste 
shells with this, dot with butter, cover with another crust and 
bake. 

These are richer than huckleberry or blueberry pies, when made 
in the usual way, the flour thickening the juice slightly and the 
butter tempering the acid. 

Blackberry pie 

Make as directed in foregoing recipe. 

Combination berry pie 

Line a deep pie-plate with pastry and bake long enough to set 
the crust on top, but not to brown, or entirely cook it. Have 
ready a mixture of equal quantities of elderberries and huckle- 
berries with one-fourth as many red currants. Dredge with 
33 



MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

flour, and sprinkle over all a generous cupful of sugar for a quart 
of berries; dot the surface with bits of butter, one tablespoon 
in all, cover with a crust which should be well turned under 
the crust of the lower one, and bake, covered, half an hour, then 
brown. 

Sweet potato pie 

Parboil, peel, and when cold, grate enough sweet potatoes to 
make a pound. Cream a half cupful of butter with three-quar- 
ters of a cupful of sugar and the beaten yolks of four eggs, a 
teaspoonful, each, of powdered cinnamon and nutmeg, the grated 
potato, the juice and rind of a lemon, a wineglassful of brandy 
and, last of all, the whites of the eggs. Line a large pie-plate 
with puff paste, fill with the mixture and bake. 

Irish potato pie 

Boil and rub through a colander or vegetable press ; then pro- 
ceed as with the sweet potatoes in last recipe, but using a full 
cupful of sugar. 

This pie is even more delicious than the sweet potato compound. 

Rhubarb and raisin pie 

Peel the rhubarb and cut into inch pieces ; pour boiling water 
over it and let stand for ten minutes. Drain; line the pie-plate 
with plain paste. Fill the pie with rhubarb, and strew over it 
one cupful of sugar and one-half cupful of raisins. Add small 
pieces of butter. Cover with a crust and bake. 

Whipped cream pie 

(Contributed) 

Line a pie-plate with a rich crust and bake in a hot oven. When 
cool spread over with a layer of jelly or marmalade. Whip one 
cupful of thick cream, sweetened with powdered sugar, and 
flavored with vanilla; pour this over the marmalade. Or fill 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 515 

crust with whipped cream to which has been added one teacupful 
of blanched chopped almonds. 

Turnover pies 

(Contributed) 

Mix a plain puff paste. Roll thin and cut into circular pieces 
about the size of a saucer. Put fruit over one-half of the piece. 
Sprinkle with sugar. Wet the edges and turn the paste over. 
Press the edges together and bake on tins in a quick oven twenty 
minutes. 

Mock mince pie 

(Contributed) 

Mix well together one cupful of raisins chopped fine, one-half 
cupful of chopped currants, one-fourth teaspoonful of Salt, one 
tablespoonful of vinegar, two-thirds of a cupfuii^f molasses, one- 
half cupful of cider, one-half cup of sugar, one-half* clip ful of cut 
citron and the juice and rind of two lemons, two Boston crack- 
ers rolled and one well-beaten egg. Line a pie-pan with paste 
and fill with some of the mixture, cover with a puff paste and 
bake. 

Washington pie 

(Contributed) 

Beat together one tablespoonful of butter, one cupful of sugar 
and one egg until light. Add one cupful of milk and two cupfuls 
of flour into which have been sifted one teaspoonful of ginger, 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon and one-half teaspoonful of baking- 
powder. Beat thoroughly until smooth. Line the Washington 
pie-plate with a plain paste, put the mixture into it and bake in 
a moderate quick oven thirty minutes. When done cover with 
frosting and set to cool. 

Crumb pie 

Soak a half cupful of bread-crumbs in enough milk to cover 
them until they are soft and have absorbed all the milk. Cream a 



516 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

third of a cupful of sugar with two ounces of butter; add two 
eggs, well beaten, and the juice and grated rind of two small 
lemons, or one very large one. Now, stir in the soaked crumbs, 
beat for a minute; turn into a pie-plate lined with puff paste, 
and bake in a hot oven until brown and very light. 

Custard pie 

Make a custard by pouring three cupfuls of scalding milk upon 
four eggs that have been beaten light with four tablespoonfuls 
of sugar. Flavor with vanilla, and pour into a pie-dish lined 
with puff paste. Bake until set. Serve cold. 

Vinegar pie (No. 1) 

One cupful of vinegar; one cupful of water; a tablespoonful 
of butter ; one heaping tablespoonful of flour wet with cold water ; 
two-thirds of a cupful of sugar. Put flour, vinegar, butter and 
sugar into a saucepan and stir until melted, then add the cold 
water. Stir until thick. Have pie-tins lined with a rich crust ; 
fill with the mixture and bake for fifteen minutes in a hot oven. 

Beat the white of an egg to a stiff meringue, adding two table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar. When the pies are done, draw 
them to the door of the oven, spread thickly with the meringue, 
and return to the oven until a very light brown. 

Vinegar pie (No. 2) 

One egg; one heaping tablespoonful of flour; one teacupful 
of sugar ; one cupful of cold water ; one tablespoonful of vinegar ; 
nutmeg to taste. Beat the egg,, add the sugar and flour, beating 
hard ; then add the other ingredients, and bake in an open crust. 

Currant tarts 

Into a quart of sifted flour chop a cupful of firm, cold butter. 
When the butter is like coarse sand add a cupful of iced water 
and work into a paste, touching with the hands as little as possi- 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 517 

ble. Turn upon a pastry-board and roll out twice ; then set on the 
ice for an hour or two. Line small buttered tart-pans with this 
paste. 

Stem and pick over ripe red currants and wash them. Nearly 
fill the pastry shells with these and sweeten very generously with 
granulated sugar. Bake, and, when cold, sprinkle with powdered 
sugar. 

Cranberry tarts 

Make a cranberry sauce according to directions already given. 
Line pate-pans with puff paste ; fill with the cranberry sauce, 
lay strips of pastry, cross-wise, over the tops, and bake in a quick 
oven. When done, sprinkle with granulated sugar and set away 
to cool. 

Lemon tarts 

Cream together a cupful of butter and two cupfuls of sugar, 
stir in the beaten yolks of six eggs, the grated rind of one, and the 
juice of two lemons, a dash of nutmeg, a wineglassful of brandy, 
and the stiffened whites of the eggs. Line pate-pans with puff 
paste, and fill with this mixture. Bake in a quick oven and serve 
cold. 

Orange cheese cakes 

Peel and seed four large oranges, saving all the juice. Boil 
half of the peels until tender, and, when cold, beat them to a paste 
with twice their weight in powdered sugar ; add the minced pulp 
and the juice of the oranges with a tablespoonful of butter; beat 
all together ; line pate-pans with puff paste, lay in the orange mix- 
ture and bake. 

There must be no fibrous skin or membrane left in the pulp. 
To get rid of this rub it through a colander. 

Cherry tarts 

Wash, stem and stone the cherries. Allow one cupful of sugar 
to a pint of cherries, if tart fruit be used. Put the sugar and one- 
half cupful of water on the fire; when boiling add the fruit and 



518 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

cook ten minutes. Stir in one teaspoonful of butter and, if the 
syrup seem thin, wet one teaspoonful of corn-starch in cold water 
and stir in to thicken the juice slightly. 

Have ready-baked pates of pastry; fill with the cherry mixture 
when the latter is cold, sift sugar over tog, and eat. 

Fried tartlets 

Make a rich puff paste and cut it into pieces six inches square. 
In the center of each square put a great spoonful of raspberry, 
strawberry, currant or gooseberry jam. Pinch the four corners 
of the square together, or fold it in half and pinch the edges 
tightly together that the fruit may not ooze out. Drop the tarts 
carefully into a kettle of deep, boiling cottolene or other fat, and 
fry quickly to a delicate brown. Drain in a colander lined with 
tissue paper. 

These are the celebrated "Banbury tarts" of English folk-lore. 



HOT PUDDINGS 

Boiled puddings 

BEFORE attempting a boiled pudding, be sure that you have a 
good mold with a tightly-fitting cover in which to cook it. You 
may use such a substitute as a bowl with a floured cloth tied over 
the top, but this is, at best, a "make-do" which may allow the 
water to enter and ruin your dough. The best substitute for a 
mold is a cottolene pail with a top, which may be made more se- 
cure by tying it on. Always grease your mold thoroughly, top, 
bottom and sides, and leave room for the swelling of the con- 
tents. Three hours will be, as a rule, the longest time required 
for the boiling of a pudding of ordinary size. All boiled pud- 
dings should be served as soon as they are cooked. 

Apple pudding (No. 1) 

Chop a cupful of suet to a coarse powder and stir it into three 
cupfuls of flour, twice sifted with a teaspoonful of baking-powder. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 519 

Add enough milk to make a dough that can be rolled out. Roll 
into a square sheet. In the center of the sheet lay three cupfuls 
of peeled and minced apples, strewn with sugar. Bring the four 
corners of the sheet over the fruit, and pinch the corners together 
in the middle. Tie up firmly with a piece of broad white tape 
passed twice around the pudding. Lay in a steamer and cook for 
two and one-half hours. Remove the tape and serve the pudding 
with a hard sauce flavored with lemon juice and powdered cinna- 
mon. 

Apple pudding (No. 2) 

Into two cupfuls of prepared flour chop a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, until it is like a coarse yellow powder. Make a batter of this 
buttered flour, a teacupful of milk and three beaten eggs. Have 
ready half a dozen peeled and sliced apples, wiped dry, then 
dredged with flour ; stir these into the batter and turn into a 
greased pudding-mold. Boil for two hours. Eat with a hot 
lemon sauce. 

Cranberry pudding 

Sift, three cupfuls of flour with a half teaspoonful of salt and 
stir in a cupful of molasses, a small cupful of sour cream, two 
beaten eggs and half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little 
boiling water. Last of all, beat in a cupful and a half of halved 
cranberries, thoroughly dredged with flour. Turn into a greased 
mold and steam for at least two hours. Eat with a hard sauce. 



Blackberry pudding

FRITTERS 

IN making fritters an essential to their success is that the fat 
in which they are fried be very deep and boiling hot. Always 
test it by dropping into it a small spoonful of batter. If this do 
not rise quickly to the surface, swell rapidly, and acquire a light 
brown hue, your fat is too cool. Let it stand over the hottest part 
of the range for a few minutes and again test it. When it is at 
the right temperature fry your fritters quickly, dropping in the 
batter by the spoonful. When done, remove, the fritters with a 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 545 

perforated spoon, and lay them in a heated colander lined with 
brown paper. Transfer to a hot platter covered with a folded 
napkin and serve at once.

Stir a pinch of soda into a pint of milk and heat in a double 
boiler. Wet two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch with cold milk, 
and when dissolved turn it into the hot milk. Stir until thick ; 
remove from the fire, and beat into it a tablespoonful of melted 
butter, three beaten eggs and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour into 
a square pan and set aside until very cold. Cut the mixture into 
small triangles, dip into batter, and fry to a golden brown. Re- 
move the fritters very carefully from the fat, as they are tender 
and break easily. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

Apple fritters 

Beat the yolks and whites of five eggs separately. Into the 
yolks stir three generous cupfuls of sweet milk, a pinch of salt 
and three scant cupfuls of flour, sifted with a teaspoonful of 
baking-powder. Beat for a minute, add the stiffened whites and, 
when these are blended, a cupful of peeled and thinly-sliced ap- 
ples. When the fritters are done and transferred to a hot dish, 
sprinkle them liberally with powdered sugar to which a little 
cinnamon has been added. 

Orange fritters 

Make a plain fritter batter with two eggs, a cupful of milk, 
half a teaspoonful of salt and sufficient flour to make a batter that 
will pour from the spoon, or coat whatever fruit is put into it. 
Peel the oranges and separate into sections, taking out the seeds. 
Dip these sections into the batter, covering well, and slide care- 
fully into hot <:ottolene or other fat, browning, first on one side, 
then on the other. They can be served with sauce, or simply 
dusted with powdered sugar. If served as a dessert, use a sauce.

cored. Fill the space left by coring with sugar, fold the corners 
together, enveloping the apple, tie up in cheese-cloth squares, 
dipped into hot water, and well floured on the inside. Have ready 
a pot of boiling water. Drop in the dumplings and cook fast one 
hour. Dip each for one second in cold water to loosen the cloth, 
turn out upon a hot dish and eat with hard sauce. 

Peach dumplings 

Make as you would apple dumplings, substituting for the cored 
apple a stoned peach, the cavity filled with sugar, then the halves 
neatly fitted together. They are very good. 

Suet dumplings 

Rub a cupful of white suet free from strings, and powder it 
fine. Rub and chop it into two cupfuls of fine crumbs. Sift a 
teaspoonful of baking-powder three times with four tablespoon-

sugar to a white cream, then beat in the juice of a lemon and a 
pinch of nutmeg. Set in a cold place until needed. 

Canned fruit sauce 

Heat with additional sugar, one large cupful of any kind of 
fruit juice or syrup left from canning. If fresh fruit juice is 
used, more sugar will be needed than for the syrup. About one- 
half cupful of sugar to each cupful of juice is an average amount. 
Mix one teaspoonful of cornstarch with the sugar, or wet it with 
the liquid if syrup is used, also one tablespoonful of butter. Boil 
all together for five minutes. 

Meringue sauce 

Rub to a light cream one-half cupful of butter with one cupful 
of powdered sugar. When light and almost snow white, add 
gradually two tablespoonfuls of fruit juice or syrup, and, just

COLD PUDDINGS AND CUSTARDS 

BESIDES the ordinary baked and boiled custards, there are many 
varieties which are easily prepared, and are delicious, as well as 
digestible. The milk of which these are made should always 
have added to it a bit of soda the size of a pea to prevent curdling. 
I shall not mention this in the following recipes, as I shall take 
it for granted that the precaution has been taken. 

Boiled cup custards 

Heat a quart of milk in a double boiler, but do not bring it 
quite to the boil. Beat five eggs light and stir into them half a cup- 
ful of sugar. On this mixture pour the scalding milk very grad- 
ually, beating steadily all the time. Return to the double boiler, 
and cook, stirring constantly, until the custard is thick enough to 
coat the spoon. If boiled longer than this it will curdle and sepa- 
rate. Remove the custard from the fire, season with two tea- 
spoonfuls of vanilla and set aside to cool. When cold, nearly 
fill glasses or cups with the mixture and heap with a meringue 
made by whipping the whites of two eggs stiff with two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. 

Baked custard 

Proceed exactly as in the preceding recipe until you have 
poured the hot milk on the sugar and eggs. At this point flavor 
the mixture with two teaspoonfuls of vanilla, and turn it into 
a pudding-dish. Grate nutmeg over the top of the custard, set 
the pudding-dish in an outer pan of boiling water, and bake in 
a moderate oven. When the custard is firm it is done.

Boiled chocolate custards 
(Contributed) 

Scald a quart of milk in a double boiler, and stir into it a bit 
of soda the size of a pea. Beat five eggs light with a half cupful 
of powdered sugar, and whip into them five tablespoonfuls of 
grated chocolate. Pour the scalding milk upon this mixture, 
return it to the fire in a double boiler, and cook, stirring con- 
stantly until it thickens and coats the spoon. Remove from the 
fire and flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla. When cold, pour 
into custard cups or glasses, and heap sweetened whipped cream 
upon the top of each. 

Baked chocolate custard 

Into a quart of scalding milk stir five tablespoonfuls of grated 
chocolate wet with cold milk. Cook for a minute. Have the 
yolks of seven eggs and the whites of five (reserving the other 
whites for a meringue) beaten light with a cupful of sugar. 
Pour the scalding milk and chocolate gradually on the eggs and 
sugar, and turn into a buttered pudding-dish set in a pan of 
boiling water. Bake until firm, then draw to the door of the 
oven and spread with a meringue made of -the reserved whites 
and two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Return to the oven 
and bake to a delicate brown. Eat cold with cream. 

French tapioca custard 

Soak four tablespoonfuls of tapioca in two cupfuls of cold 
water and let it stand for four hours; add a quart of scalding 
milk, and stir for a minute. Turn all into a double boiler, and 
bring to the scalding point, 'then pour gradually upon the yolks 
of four eggs beaten light with a cupful of sugar. Cook again in 
a double boiler for ten minutes, by which time the custard should 
be thick. Set in the ice until very cold. Now whip the whites 
of the four eggs stiff, beat them into the custard, add two tea- 
spoonfuls of vanilla, tvirn into a glass bowl, and serve. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 557 

Tapioca cocoanut custard 

Make as directed in last recipe, but add to the beaten whites 
at the last a cupful of finely-grated cocoanut sweetened with 
powdered sugar. 

Floating island 

Heat a pint of milk to scalding in a double boiler. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs stiff setting the whites in the ice-box until 
they are needed for a meringue. Into the whipped yolks stir 
three tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar, and pour the scalding 
milk gradually upon these. Return to the fire and cook, stirring 
all the time, until the custard is thick enough to coat the spoon. 
Remove from the fire, and, when the custard is cool, flavor with 
a teaspoonful of vanilla and turn into a glass bowl. Whip the 
chilled whites to a stiff meringue and beat into this, a little at a 
time, three tablespoonfuls of red jelly catawba grape or currant. 
The meringue should be pink in color, and may be heaped upon 
the top of the custard in the bowl. 

Rice custard 

Cream a tablespoonful of butter with two of powdered sugar, 
and gradually work in three beaten eggs. Add two cupfuls of 
milk, and when you have a smooth mixture, two cupfuls of cold, 
boiled rice. Beat until free from lumps, add a pinch of salt, and 
turn into a greased pudding-dish. Set in the oven in a pan of 
boiling water, and bake, covered, until the custard is set. Uncover 
and brown. Eat cold with sugar and cream. 

i 

Cocoanut custard 

Wet five tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with cold milk, and 
stir it into a quart of scalding milk until thick and free of lumps. 
Whip six eggs light with a cupful of sugar, and add gradually to 
the thickened milk. Cook for five minutes ; add, at once, a grated 
cocoanut, and take from the fire. Flavor with a teaspoonful of

rose-water, and when it begins to cool, .pour into a glass bowl. 
When cold, eat with sugar and cream. 

Orange custard 
(Contributed) 

Squeeze out and strain the juice of six good oranges. Add a 
cupful of sugar and cook slowly for half an hour, skimming often. 
Take from the fire and turn into a bowl. When lukewarm, pour 
gradually, beating all the time, upon a warm custard made of the 
yolks of five eggs and two cupfuls of milk. Put in your egg- 
whip and beat steadily five minutes. Turn into a glass bowl, and 
lay upon the top a meringue made by whipping the whites of the 
eggs with five tablespoon fuls of powdered sugar. Set upon ice 
until very cold. 

Coffee custards 

Into a quart of rich custard cooked and still warm stir a pint 
of very strong, clear, hot, black coffee. Beat for five minutes 
until thick and creamy. Fill glasses or custard cups with it, and 
heap whipped cream on top of each. Set in cracked ice until you 
serve. 

Cinnamon custard 
(Contributed) 

Bring a quart of milk to the boiling point. Add a saltspoon 
of salt, a piece of cinnamon stick and three ounces of sugar. 
Strain, and when cold mix with two or three well-beaten eggs. 
Pour into a pudding-dish and cover the top of the dish with 
slices of brown bread, buttered on both sides and cut in triangu- 
lar pieces. Bake iri a slow oven and serve with hot sauce. 



WHIPPED CREAM DISHES 

THE easiest and most rapid way to whip cream is with an or- 
dinary, old-fashioned wire egg-whip. Put the cream into a shal- 
low dish and set in the ice-box until thoroughly chilled. Into a

MERINGUE GLACE AND WHIPPED CREAM 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 559 

half-pint stir two teaspoonfuls of sugar and begin at once to beat 
with regular, steady strokes, not removing the froth as it forms, 
but whipping until the cream is a thick, stiff, smooth mass. If 
the cream is cold, if the utensils are chilled, and the room is not 
too warm, the desired effect may be produced in ten minutes. I 
have done it in five. When the sillibub has reached the right 
consistency add a teaspoonful of such flavoring as you desire. A 
half-pint of cream whips to a pint. 

Orange cream 

Soak a half -package of gelatine in a cupful of cold water for 
an hour, then stir it into a cupful of boiling water. Have ready 
the juice of two oranges and the grated rind of one, and pour 
over them a cupful of sugar and the hot liquid gelatine. Set at 
the side of the range while you beat the yolks of three eggs stiff. 
Strain the hot liquid and pour, a very little at a time, upon the 
beaten yolks, stirring constantly. Heat again in a double boiler, 
beating all the while, and as soon as the custard reaches the 
boiling point remove and set aside to cool. When cold and 
thick, beat into it a pint of whipped cream. 

Chestnuts with whipped cream 

Shell and boil Spanish chestnuts, remove the skins and rub the 
nuts through a colander. Sweeten to taste and beat to a soft 
paste with a little cream., Form the mixture into a pyramid in 
the center of a chilled platter, and heap sweetened, whipped 
cream around it. 

Prune Charlotte 

Stew a dozen and a half large prunes ; when cold, remove the 
stones and chop fine. Whip a pint of cream very stiff with three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, then whip the minced prunes into this. 
Line a glass dish with lady-fingers, or thin slices of sponge cake, 
and fill the center with the prune cream. Set in the ice-box until 
time to serve.

Fruited whipped cream 

Whip a pint of cream stiff, sweeten abundantly and stir into it 
lightly a cup of whole strawberries, a banana peeled, and cut into 
dice an orange, treated in the same way, and a cup of finely- 
minced pineapple. Serve very cold. As the fruits are acid, the 
cream should be very sweet. 

Peach sponge 

Mash two quarts of peeled and cut-up peaches. Strew sugar 
over them, and let them stand for an hour to draw out the juice. 
Put the fruit through a vegetable press and extract all the juice. 
Soak a box of gelatine in cold water until dissolved, add four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and heat to scalding. Now stir in the 
peach juice, remove from the fire, and strain. When cool, set the 
bowl containing the mixture in a pan of ice, and beat into it a pint 
of whipped cream. When very stiff turn into a mold to form. 

Peach tapioca 

Soak a cup of tapioca over night. Peel and cut up ten peaches ; 
add a cup of sugar and stew until tender. Boil the tapioca in two 
cups of water until clear, then stir the steweT^eaches into it. Re- 
move from the fire, add the juice of a small lemon and set away 
to cool. Eat with whipped cream. 

Strawberry float 

Mash two quarts of berries and strain off the juice. Sweeten 
this and add it to a pint of very rich cream. Whip the whites of 
four eggs stiff with six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and 
beat in the mashed berries. Put the pink cream in the bottom of 
a glass bowl and heap the strawberry meringue high upon it. 

Raspberry float 

May be made according to the foregoing recipe, substituting 
raspberries for strawberries. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS * 561 

Pineapple Charlotte 

Grate or chop a pineapple very fine, after peeling it and remov- 
ing the "eyes." Soak a half-box of gelatine for an hour in a 
half cupful of cold water, then add a cupful of granulated sugar 
and a cupful of boiling water, and stir over the fire just long 
enough to dissolve the gelatine. As the mixture cools add the 
pineapple ; set the bowl containing it in a vessel of cracked ice, 
and stir steadily until the mixture thickens. Now beat in a pint 
of sweetened, whipped cream and turn into a mold wet with cold 
water. When formed, eat with powdered sugar and cream. 

Apple snow 

Stew peeled and sliced apples until they are so soft that they 
can be rubbed through a colander. There should be a pint of 
this apple sauce. Set aside until cold. Beat the whites of three 
eggs to a stiff froth, and into this beat the apples by the spoonful, 
alternately with a cupful of powdered sugar. When very stiff, 
add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, turn into chilled glasses, heap 
whipped cream upon the top, and serve. 

Marrons with whipped cream 

Chop half a bottle of marrons and put a teaspoonful in the bot- 
tom of each glass custard cup. Pour a little of the liquor in which 
they were put upon these, and fill the glasses with whipped cream. 
Set, in cracked ice until served. 

Whipped cream with macaroons 

Crush stale almond macaroons fine, and beat into whipped 
cream just before serving. Heap in a chilled bowl, sift maca- 
roon-crumbs thickly on top, and serve. 



562 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Orange and cocoanut delight 

Use very sweet oranges for this dish, and do not try dried 
cocoanut. Buy the fresh fruit, and grate it. 

In the bottom of a glass bowl put a layer of sliced and seeded 
oranges, sprinkle with granulated sugar, and then with a layer 
of the grated cocoanut. On this put a generous spoonful of 
sweetened and whipped cream. Now another layer of the su- 
gared oranges, more cocoanut and whipped cream, and so on 
until the dish is full. The top layer must be of whipped cream, 
heaped high in the center. 

Pineapple snow 

Soak a half-box of gelatine in a scant cupful of cold water for 
an hour. Peel a small pineapple, and grate it ; then cover with 
a cup of sugar, and let it stand for an hour before stirring the 
soaked gelatine into it. Turn all into a saucepan set within a 
pan of boiling water, and stir until the gelatine and sugar are 
dissolved. Remove from the fire and let it cool, but riot stiffen. 
Whip a pint of cream very stiff. Stand the saucepan containing 
the gelatine and pineapple in a deep bowl of cracked ice and, as 
the mixture stiffens, beat into it, by the spoonful, the whipped 
cream. Beat steadily until all the cream is in, and the jelly is 
stiff and white. Turn into a glass bowl, and set in the ice for 
some hours. Serve with rich cream. 



Raspberry cream sponge 

Mash a quart of red raspberries, and stir into them a large 
cupful of granulated sugar. Soak a half cupful of gelatine in a 
cupful of cold water for an hour. Pour upon the gelatine a cup- 
ful of boiling water. Stir until the gelatine is dissolved, then 
add the sweetened berries. Strain all through a muslin bag, 
pressing hard to extract the juice. Turn into a bowl to get cool. 
When cool, set the bowl in an outer vessel of cracked ice, and 
as the jelly stiffens, beat into it, by the spoonful, a pint of whipped 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 563 

cream. Beat until stiff and very cold. Set in the ice to form. 
Serve with sweetened cream. 



Banana froth 

Whip a cupful of cream stiff. Rub enough bananas through 
a fine sieve to make a cupful of pulp, and beat this at once into 
the whipped cream ; add four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
and beat to a frothy mass. Line a glass dish with almond mac- 
aroons, fill it with the banana cream, and sprinkle this generously 
with tiny bits of crystallized cherries, citron and blanched and 
minced almonds. Serve at once. Of course, the fruits and nuts 
must be minced and made ready before the preparation of the 
banana cream is begun. 

Macaroon Charlotte Kusse 

Soak macaroons in custard until rather soft, but not broken, 
and line a dish with them. Beat a pint of cream stiff, and stir 
into it half a cupful of blanched and chopped almonds and the 
same quantity of minced citron. Heap this upon the soaked 
macaroons. 

BLANC MANGE 

Arrowroot blanc mange 

Put half a pint of milk into a double boiler, and when it reaches 
the scalding point stir into it three heaping teaspoonfuls of arrow- 
root which have been dissolved in a gill of cold water. Stir un- 
til thick and smooth ; remove from the fire, flavor with a half- 
teaspoonful of vanilla, and pour into a bowl to cool. Set in the 
ice-box until needed. Serve with powdered sugar and cream. 

Vanilla blanc mange 

Soak a half-package of gelatine in enough water to cover it, 
and at the end of two hours stir into it a half cupful of sugar. 



564 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Add this to a pint of scalding milk, and stir until the gelatine is 
dissolved; remove from the fire, strain and flavor with a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Pour into wet molds to form. When firm, 
serve with sweetened whipped cream. 


Chocolate blanc mange (No. 1) 

Soak a package of gelatine in a half-pint of cold milk for two 
hours. Stir a pinch of soda into a quart of rich milk, and bring 
to the scalding point in double boiler. Beat the yolks of two 
eggs light with a small cupful of granulated sugar. Stir the 
soaked gelatine into the hot milk, and when it dissolves pour the 
hot liquid gradually upon the yolks and sugar ; then whip in five 
tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate wet to a paste with a little cold 
milk. Put all into a double boiler and cook, stirring all the time, 
until the boiling point is just reached. Remove at once from the 
fire, turn into a bowl, whip in the stiffened whites of the eggs, and 
a teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour into a mold wet with cold water 
and set in a cool place to form. When ready to serve, wring a 
cloth out in hot water, wrap it for a moment about the mold, and 
turn the contents out upon a chilled glass dish. Eat with pow- 
dered sugar and rich, sweet cream. 

Chocolate blanc mange '(No. 2) 

Heat a pint of milk and add to it a pinch of soda. Into the 
milk stir a half-cupful of sugar, and, when this is dissolved, two 
generous tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet with cold milk. Cook

DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 565 

upon these two cupfuls of boiling- water. Stir until the gelatine 
is dissolved, strain and set aside to cool. Beat the whites of 
three eggs to a stiff meringue, and when the jelly is cold and be- 
gins to thicken, whip into it this meringue. Beat from fifteen to 
twenty minutes, or until the mixture is like a stiff white foam. 
Wet a mold with cold water, pour the jelly into this, and set in 
the ice. When you are ready to serve the pudding, turn it out 
upon a chilled dish, and eat with sugar and cream, or with soft 
custard. 

Banana blanc mange 

Soak a tablespoonful of gelatine for an hour in a teacupful of 
water. Bring a cupful and a half of milk to the boiling point, 
add a pinch of baking-soda, and stir in a half cupful of sugar and 
the soaked gelatine. Boil for five minutes, stirring steadily. 
Line a jelly-mold with sliced bananas and pour the lukewarm

Peach sponge 

Soak a half-box of gelatine for two hours. Peel and slice a 
dozen peaches, add to them a cupful and a half of sugar and 
a half cupful of water, and stew until the fruit is broken to 
pieces. Now stir in the soaked gelatine. When this is dissolved 
rub all through a coarse sieve, add a tablespoQnful of lemon juice, 
and when the mixture is cool and beginning to thicken whip in 
the stiffened whites of four eggs. Beat steadily for fifteen min- 
utes, and turn into a mold to form. Serve very cold with whipped 
cream. 

Italian cream 

Soak half a box of gelatine in a cupful of cold water for an 
hour. Heat four cupfuls of milk in a double boiler, and when 
hot stir into them the yolks of four eggs beaten light with half 
a cupful of sugar. Stir over the fire for two minutes, add the 
gelatine and keep stirring until dissolved. Take from the fire, 
flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla and set aside to cool. Beat 



566 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the whites of the eggs stiff, and add them to the custard when it 
is cold, but before it has begun to form. Turn into a mold wet 
with cold water and set aside to form firm. 



Pink pudding 

Soak a package of gelatine for an hour in a cupful of cold 
water. Mash a pint of ripe strawberries and turn upon them a 
cupful of granulated sugar. Pour a pint of boiling water upon 
the gelatine, and stir over the fire until dissolved ; add the sugar

the jelly is very cold whip the whites of five eggs to a stiff 
meringue and beat the jelly into them. Turn into a mold and 
set in ice to form. Serve with whipped cream. 

Brown mange 

Soak a half-box of gelatine in a cupful of milk for three hours. 
Stir into it a cupful of granulated sugar, and pour upon it a 
scant quart of scalding not boiling milk. Add a half-cake of 
grated chocolate wet to a paste with milk. ' Stir over the fire just 
long enough to dissolve the gelatine and melt the chocolate, but 
do not let the milk boil. Pour the hot milk gradually upon the 
stiffened whites of four eggs. Turn the mixture into a bowl and 
set this in a pan of ice while you beat the contents long and 
steadily until the jelly begins to stiffen. Turn into a glass bowl 
and set on the ice to form. When cold and firm, send to the table 
with great spoonfuls of whipped cream upon the top of the brown 
"mange." 

Rose mange 

A pretty blanc mange may be made according to the foregoing 
recipe by omitting tlje chocolate and using in its place just enough 
juice from preserved strawberries to color the mixture a delicate 
pink. When the whipped cream is added dot the white surface 
with a few of the preserved berries. 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 56; 

Strawberry sponge 

Soak one-half package of gelatine in one-half cupful of cold 
water for two hours. Mash one quart of fine strawberries and 
add one-half cupful of sugar and the juice of two lemons. Boil 
one-half cupful of sugar in a cupful of water gently for twenty 
minutes. Rub the strawberries through a sieve. Add the gela- 
tine to the boiling syrup and take from the fire at once. Then 
add the strawberries, pour the mixture into a dish set in cracked 
ice and beat thoroughly for five minutes. Add the beaten whites 
of four eggs and beat until the mixture begins to thicken. Pour 
into molds and set away until firm. 

Cider jelly 

Soak one package of gelatine in a cupful of cold water for two 
hours. Add three cupfuls of sugar and the juice of three lem- 
ons ; also the grated rind of one lemon. Dissolve this in one 
quart of boiling water. Then add one pint of good sweet cider, 
strain, pour into molds and let it stand on ice for several hours. 

Junket 

Milk is indispensable for family desserts, forming as it does 
the basis of tender custards and velvety creams. One of the 
most delicious of the metamorphoses to which it is susceptible is 
when, by the addition of a rennet tablet, it is changed into a tender 
and smooth junket. The tablet is preferable to liquid rennet, 
being more easily carried and more easily kept. 

Flavor a quart and a pint of fresh milk with two teaspoonfuls 
of vanilla, and -then mix with it two tablespoonfuls of rennet. 
Stir for a moment and put into a warm room to form. As soon 
as the milk has "set," put the dish containing it in the ice-chest 
until it is time to send it to the table. Eat with sugar and cream. 
This dessert should not be made more than two hours before it 
is to be served, as long standing causes the milk to separate and 
form into curds and whey. 



568 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Vanilla junket 

Dissolve one rennet tablet in a tablespoonful of cold water. 
Stir this into a quart of milk that is just lukewarm and has been 
flavored with a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Set in a warm 
room until firm, then put into the ice-chest until needed. This 
dessert should not be made more than two hours before the meal 
for which it is intended, as long standing causes it to break and 
separate. Eat with sugar and cream. 



Coffee junket (very nice) 

Dissolve a rennet tablet in a tablespoonful of water. Into a 
pint and a half of milk stir a gill of very strong black coffee, 
liberally sweetened. Add the dissolved rennet and turn into a 
glass bowl. Leave in a cool room until formed, then set on the 
ice immediately. Eat with sweetened whipped cream.

Banana Charlotte 

In a double boiler heat a cupful of cream, to which you have 
added a pinch of soda. Sweeten slightly, and thicken with a 
heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch dissolved in a gill of cold 
milk. Keep warm over hot water stirring occasionally to pre- 
vent lumping while you nearly fill a bowl with alternate layers 
of sliced bananas and very thin slices of sponge cake the latter 
moistened slightly with milk. When the bowl is three-quarters 
full pour over the contents the thickened cream and set aside to 
get very cold. Fill the bowl with sweetened whipped cream, 
heap it high and serve. 

Pound cake trifle 

Cut a pound cake and spread each slice thickly with raspberry 
jam. Lay on a flat dish, and heap on each slice a great spoonful 
of meringue made by whipping the whites of four eggs stiff, 
then adding sugar and currant jelly to taste, and beating into a 
pink mass. Serve with cream. 

Peach trifle 

Boil together for five minutes one cupful of sugar and one 
cupful of water. Put into this one quart of pared peaches. Stir 
slowly until tender. When almost cold press them through 
a sieve. Line a deep glass dish with stale sponge cake dipped 
in sherry. Spread over this the cold peach pulp. Flavor one 
and a half cupfuls of thick sweet cream with two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful, each, of vanilla and lemon 
and whip until thick and solid. Pour this into the peaches and 
let it stand until very cold. 

Raspberry trifle 

Line the bottom of a deep glass dish with thin slices of sponge 
cake. Squeeze over it a little raspberry juice and cover with a 
thick layer of whole sweetened red raspberries. Over this an- 



5-0 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

other layer of the cake and another of the raspberries until the 
dish is filled three-quarters full. Pour over all this a plain boiled 
custard and serve very cold. 

Rhubarb trifle 

Cook soft two cupfuls of rhubarb, scraped and cut into inch 
lengths, using barely enough water to keep it from scorching. 
Soak a half-ounce of gelatine, and when ready for use strain 
into it the rhubarb rubbed through a sieve; add six or eight 
ounces of sugar and a cupful of cream ; stir over the fire until 
well heated through, but do not let it boil, and pour into a wet 
mold. Set on ice. Serve with whipped cream. 

Strawberry Charlotte 

Mash a quart of ripe "capped" berries, and sweeten abun- 
dantly. Beat the whites of four eggs stiff, then whip in the ber- 
ries strained through a sieve. Beat until smooth and stiff. Line 
a chilled dish with sponge cake, and fill with the pink "whip." 
Dot the top thickly with ripe berries. 

Rice blanc mange 

Soak a quarter-box of gelatine in a quarter-cupful of water one 
hour ; rub a quarter of a pound of rice flour in a little cold milk ; 
add this to one quart of scalding milk; stir constantly for five 
minutes; add a cupful and a half of sugar and the soaked gela- 
tine ; stir for one minute, then add the grated rind of one lemon ; 
strain this into a bowl. When a little cool mix in half a tea- 
spoonful of bitter almond ; turn into a mold that has been wet in 
cold water ; stand in a cold place until ready to serve. 

Tipsy pudding 

Line a glass dish with thin slices of sponge cake. Moisten the 
slices with sherry or some other good wine. Put over this a 
layer of preserved fruit, another layer of cake and another of 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 571 

fruit, and so on until the dish is filled. Pour over the whole a 

quart of rich boiled custard. 

i 

Strawberry sillibub 

Line a glass bowl with thin slices of sponge cake. Pour over 
the cake enough strawberry juice to dissolve the cake. Rub off 
on blocks of loaf sugar the yellow rind of two oranges, and dis- 
solve the sugar in a pint of rich cream. Squeeze the juice of 
the oranges on some powdered loaf sugar, and add it gradually 
to the cream. Whip the mixture to a stiff froth, then heap it 
on the dissolved cake. Ornament the top with large strawber- 
ries, halved. 

Orange jelly (No. 1) 

For a quart of jelly allow three oranges with deep yellow 
skins and two lemons. Squeeze out and strain the juice. Soak 
half a package of gelatine in the juice, but before pressing the 
fruit grate carefully all the outside, so that no white mixes with 
the yellow rind. Cover the grated peel with a quart of cold 
water, softened by a pinch of baking-soda; bring gradually to 
the boil and simmer for five minutes. Add a teacupful of sugar 
to the soaked gelatine, then strain into it through a flannel bag, 
or fine sieve, the hot orange water, stirring all the while. 

Wet a mold with cold water, put in the jelly and set on ice to 
form. 

Orange jelly (No. 2) 

Soak a half-box of gelatine in enough cold water to cover it. 
At the end of two hours stir into it a cupful of granulated sugar, 
put it into a saucepan and pour upon it three cupfuls of boiling 
water. Stir over the fire until the gelatine and sugar are dis- 
solved, when add a cupful of strained orange juice and a dash 
of cinnamon. Do not allow the jelly to boil after the orange 
juice has been added, but remove at once; strain through flannel 
and turn into a mold wet with cold water. Set in a cold place 
to form. 

Or a prettier fashion is to pour the liquid jelly into halved 



572 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

orange peels from which the pulp has been carefully removed, 
and which have lain in cold water for half an hour. When firm, 
the jelly should be eaten from these improvised bowls. 

Coffee jelly 

Soak one-half box of gelatine in one-half cupful of cold water. 
Put a cupful of sugar and one of water over the fire, and stir to 
a quick boil. Pour it over the gelatine and stir until it is dis- 
solved. Add two cupfuls of strong, clear, black coffee, and 
strain. Turn into a wetted mold. Serve with whipped cream. 

Tapioca jelly 

Soak a half cupful of tapioca over night in a cupful of cold 
water. Put into a double boiler a pint of boiling water and dis- 
solve in this a tablespoonful of granulated sugar. Now turn in 
the soaked tapioca and cook until clear. Remove from the fire 
and add two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice. Have ready jelly 
glasses wet with cold water, and turn the liquid jelly into these. 
Set in a cold place to form. Serve very cold with sweetened 
cream. 

Raspberry jelly 

Stir into a quart of red raspberries a cupful of granulated 
sugar. At the end of an hour run the berries through a vegetable 
press, and strain the juice thus produced through' a flannel bag. 
Have ready a half-box of gelatine soaked in a cupful of cold 
water for two hours, and pour over this a pint of boiling water. 
Strain and stir in the sweetened raspberry juice, then set aside 
to get cold. Wet a jelly mold, line with firm, ripe raspberries, 
and pour the cool half-firm jelly carefully into it. Set in a cold 
place to form. Eat with cream. 

Rice jelly 

Wash a cupful of rice and soak it for two hours in a cupful of 
water. Have ready on the range a quart of boiling water and 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 573 

turn the rice and the water in which it was soaked into this. Boil 
for three-quarters of an hour, then strain through a muslin bag. 
When cold and thick, serve with powdered sugar and cream. It 
is very nice and nourishing. 

Banana souffle (cold) 

Put into a double boiler a pint of milk (half cream if you can 
get it), and add a pinch of baking-soda. Beat the yolks of three 
eggs light with five heaping tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar. 
Add to the beaten eggs and sugar a teaspoonful of corn-starch 
dissolved in a little cold milk. When the milk reaches the scald- 
ing point add the egg mixture and stir to a smooth custard, or 
one that will coat the spoon. Slice four bananas thin into the 
bottom of a deep pudding-dish, add to the hot custard a teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla and pour it over the bananas. Have the whites of 
the eggs whipped to a stiff meringue, with two tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar ; heap it on top of the custard and bake in a 
quick oven to a delicate brown. Serve very cold with whipped 
cream. 

Cream puffs 

Melt a half-pound of butter in a pint of scalding water, and 
when this boils stir in three-quarters of a pound of flour. Stir 
steadily for a minute, or until the flour does not stick to the sides 
of the saucepan. Remove from the fire. When the mixture is 
cool whip in, one at a time, eight eggs beaten very light. Set on 
the ice for an hour. Line pans with buttered paper and drop 
the mixture by even spoonfuls at regular intervals far apart 
upon this paper. Bake in a hot oven until the puffs are golden 
brown. When cold, cut a slit in the side of each and fill with a 
cream made by the following recipe : 

Cream puff filling 

Thicken a cupful of hot milk with three tablespoonfuls of flour 
wet to a paste with cold water. When it has boiled for a minute, 
and is free from lumps, remove from the fire and pour upon three 



574 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

eggs, well beaten with a half cupful of powdered sugar. Stir 
over the fire to a thick, smooth cream ; remove, flavor with 
vanilla, and when cold fill the puffs. 

Macaroons 

Beat the whites of three eggs stiff with three-quarters of a 
pound of powdered sugar. Stir in half a pound of finely-crum- 
bled almond paste; beat until smooth, and drop by the spoonful 
upon greased paper. Bake for ten minutes in a steady oven. 

Tutti-frutti jelly of canned fruit 

Make a good jelly, using the liquor from the canned fruit as 
seasoning. Strain while hot, and pour a little into a wet mold 
or bowl. When the jelly begins to form put a layer of chopped 
fruit upon the jelly, cover with more jelly (which you should 
have kept slightly warm). When this is firm, more fruit, and 
so on until materials are used up. When firm and cold, you can 
slice at pleasure. 

Prune and nut jelly 

Soak a cupful of prunes all night ; drain and stew them until 
tender in three cupfuls of water. Before taking them from the 
fire add a cupful of sugar. Drain the prunes, keeping the syrup, 
chop them and stir into them two dozen blanched and chopped 
almonds. Soak two-thirds of a box of gelatine in a cupful of 
cold water for two hours, add a cupful of boiling water and the 
prune liquor. Stir over the fire until the gelatine is dissolved ; 
then remove, add the juice of a lemon and two tablespoonfuls 
of sherry. Turn into a glass dish, and when partly congealed 
stir in the prunes and nuts. Every few minutes stir the jelly 
until it becomes firm enough to prevent the fruit from sinking 
to the bottom. Eat very cold with sweetened, whipped cream. 

Wine jelly 

Soak one-half box of gelatine in one-half cupful of cold water 
for an hour; put irto a saucepan two cupfuls of boiling water, 



DINNER SWEETS OF ALL SORTS 575 

one cupful of sugar and some thin slices of lemon peel. When 
the sugar has dissolved add the gelatine and stir until that has 
dissolved ; remove from the fire, and when partly cool add the 
juice of one lemon and three-quarters of a cupful of sherry wine. 
Pour into molds and set to cool, 



FRUIT DESSERTS 

WHEN people call in, or upon, a doctor, in the expectation of 
hearing that their internal mechanism is "all agley," and to pay 
well for the knowledge, they want something to show for what 
they have done and mean to do. The physician's catechism and 
advice that do not entail an application to a druggist for further 
help to the deranged machinery, the transfer of vial, box or 
packet to the patient's hands, and the passage of coin of the 
realm or paper of the republic fr6m one pocket to another, are 
a violation of civilized usages. 

"It is naught! It is naught!" saith the patient, and when he 
is gone his way he complaineth. Henceforward neither he nor 
his listeners to his tale of fraud, "doctor with" the candid prac- 
titioner forevermore. 

It will be seen that a certain physician ran one positive and sev- 
eral possible risks when he said to an anemic, wild-eyed patient, 
teetering upon the inner edge of nervous prostration, with a tilt in 
the wrong direction : 

"A sanitarium ! By no means ! And drugs, nervines, sedatives 
and the like would do you no permanent good. The best of them 
are mere placebos that amuse the invalid while nature cures him. 
What you need what most broken-down women need is fresh 
air and fresh fruit. Plenty of both ! Live out of doors and live 
upon fruit!" 

Then he charged as liberal a fee as if he had recommended 
an ocean voyage, Baden-Baden, Carlsbad, and "ites" and "ines" 
by the dozen. 

If he had ordered a tank of oxygen to be sent to the invalid's 
room and fallen to work pumping the gas into her lungs at a 
cost of one hundred dollars per day, the sufferer and the suffer- 

576 



FRUIT DESSERTS 577 

er's friends and gossips would have been satisfied, because im- 
pressed with the novelty and the scientific flavor of the proceed- 
ing. The means would be commensurate with the end to be 
gained. 

Eat abundantly as much as you can without surfeit, of what* 
ever fruit agrees with you best, and while this regimen is going 
on, sparingly of meat and rich gravies, not at all of pastry. Let 
the assuasive, and dissuasive, and persuasive juices of ripe, fresh 
fruit have their perfect work. Take your case in hand seriously, 
and with a definite, intelligent intention. Drugs interfere with 
nature ; fresh air and fruit are her obedient handmaidens. 

Apples 

Many persons fancy that raw apples are indigestible, and only 
endurable in the early morning. Doubtless the old adage that 
fruit is gold in the morning, silver in the middle of the day, and 
lead at night, is to some extent answerable for this (to my way 
of thinking) erroneous impression. 

Dietitians tell us that ripe, raw apples contain more phosphates 
in proportion to their bulk than any other article of food, fish not 
excepted. A recent writer on this point boldly declares that in 
this lies the secret of healthful longevity. They correct bilious- 
ness and act as a sedative upon the racked nerves and allay in- 
somnia. 

"Eat uncooked apples constantly, although, of course, in mod- 
eration, and drink distilled water only, and years will be added 
to your life, while the evidences of age will be long in coming. 

"This argument is based on the supposition that as age ad- 
vances, the deposits of mineral matter in the system increase, 
and that aging is little more than a gradual process of ossification. 

"Phosphoric acid contains the least amount of earth-salts, and 
for that reason is probably the nearest approach to the elixir of 
life known to the scientific world. 

"If you want to live long, to retain your youth at the same 
time, and to increase your brain-tissue, eat plenty of apples, 
37 



578 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

drink only distilled water, and eat as little bread as possible. A 
diluted solution of phosphoric acid is also recommended to those 
who care to take pains to follow the diet here outlined." 

Tart apples are far more wholesome than sweet, and all, like 
potatoes, should be fully ripe when eaten. 

Wash and polish them for the table, arrange in a silver basket or 
glass dish, and pass silver knives with them. The touch of steel 
injures the flavor. 

Peaches 

Neither wash nor wipe. The soft down upon the cheek of a ripe 
peach is one of its charms. Keep on the ice until you are ready 
to serve, then pile in a fruit dish and garnish with peach leaves. 
Pass silver knives with them. 

To prepare grapefruit for table 

Cut the grapefruit in half, and dig out the hard core and seeds, 
leaving a hollow in the center. Loosen the pulp from the skin all 
around the sides of the fruit, so that it can be eaten easily with 
a spoon. The method from this point is determined by the indi- 
vidual taste. Some persons like the fruit without sugar. Others 
fill the hollow in the middle with sugar, and pour upon this a 
little rum, or sherry, or Maraschino. The addition of a few 
Maraschino cherries is often made, and in hot weather the fruit 
is sometimes laid in the ice. 



Picked pineapple 

Peel the pineapple and remove the little dark protuberances 
upon the surface of the fruit. With a fork pick or tear the fruit 
into strips, strew these with granulated sugar and set in the ice 
until wanted. 

Pineapple and raspberries 

Trim the bottom of a large pineapple so that it will stand up- 
right. Cut off the top, but do not throw it away. With a sharp 



FRUIT DESSERTS 579 

knife dig out the inside of the fruit, taking care that the knife 
does not penetrate the sides or walls of the pineapple. Put this 
hollowed case, and the top into the refrigerator until needed. 
Pick the inside of the pineapple into tiny bits, and mix with it a 
cupful of red raspberries. Sweeten abundantly with granulated 
sugar, and turn the fruit into a glass, or a china jar, with a 
closely fitting cover. Put on the lid and bury the jar in the ice 
for several hours. Just before time to serve it, remove from the 
ice, fill the hollowed shell with the fruit mixture, replace the top 
on the pineapple and send to table. 

Pineapple and strawberries 

Cut off the top of a pineapple, and pare away the bottom so 
that it will stand upright and firm on the plate ; scoop out the 
pulp, discarding the core ; mix the pulp with strawberries cut in 
halves, the juice of an orange and sugar to taste. Return the 
mixture to the shell and chill thoroughly. Garnish the dish with 
leaves from the crown. 

Strawberries 

If large and ripe, do not cap them but pass whole, with pow- 
dered sugar that each eater may help himself. Holding the stem 
as a handle, he dips the fruit in the sugar and nibbles it daintily. 



ICE CREAM AND ICES 

FREEZERS that speedily congeal the contents of their grinding 
depths may be bought so cheaply, our housekeeper will find that 
in the long run it is economy to buy a patent freezer and make 
her ices at home. 

In freezing creams of all sorts, and water, or fruit ices, the 
process is greatly simplified by having the ice crushed fine. Many 
cooks who are new to the business, do not recognize this fact. 
In consequence, they learn that to freeze cream takes very much 
longer than they were led to imagine from the circular advertis- 
ing "the most rapid freezer ever put upon the market." While 
this circular may to a certain extent exaggerate the facts, do not 
condemn the new machine until you have pounded or shaved 
your ice very fine. A machine for shaving ice facilitates this 
process. Lacking this, put the ice into a strong bag and pound 
it fine with a wooden mallet. 

I wish it were in my power to name and recommend "a perfect 
freezer" of any kind. Grinding is slow work ; it is hard work ; 
it is hot work at a season when action begets discomfort. My 
heart leaped high within me when a correspondent wrote gush- 
ingly of a freezer that "did the business of, and in itself without 
calling upon housewife or cook for so much as a turn or touch." 
Upon trial of the "perfect" machine, I found the product after 
I had faithfully obeyed instructions coarse-grained, and shot 
with icy needles. I can, however, refer to a self-freezing process 
practised in my household for twenty odd years, and with never 
a failure. 

Pour your cream, of whatever kind, into the freezer, surround 
with alternate layers of ice, shaved or cracked almost as fine as 
snow, and rock salt. Fill to the top and pour over all two quarts 

580 



ICE CREAM AND ICES 581 

of the strongest brine. Bury the freezer out of sight in cracked 
ice and throw a piece of carpet, or a doubled sack over all, and 
don't touch it again for an hour. Open then and beat and churn, 
when you have scraped the frozen cream from the sides down 
into the middle. Have a stout "dasher" in miniature made, and 
work diligently for at least five or six minutes. The granulation 
and ice-needles of the "perfect machine" were the consequence 
of neglect of this beating and churning. Now close the freezer, 
pack down again in rock salt and finely pounded ice, burying it 
out of sight as before, put a weight on the top, unless the freezer 
be fast to the bottom of the outer vessel, and let all alone for 
two hours more longer if you like. 

You will have then a pillar of lusciousness, smooth as cream 
can be and should be. Dip the freezer in hot water and turn out, 
or wrap a towel wet in hot water about it to loosen the cream. 

All ices are the better for being packed down in ice for some 
time after they are frozen. It is a ripening and mellowing pro- 
cess. If you wish to add fruit or nuts to the plain custard or 
cream beat them in when you open the freezer to "churn" the 
contents. 

Vanilla ice cream 

Make a custard of a quart of milk, seven eggs and four cup- 
fuls of granulated sugar. Remove from the fire and flavor with 
vanilla extract. When cold beat into the custard a quart of rich 
cream, and freeze. 

It is made more elegant and delicious by pouring over each 
plateful, when served, a hot or a cold chocolate, or cold strawberry 
sauce. 

Chocolate sauce for vanilla ice cream 

Rub four heaping tablespoonfuls of sweet chocolate (grated 
fine) to a smooth paste, with six tablespoonfuls of cream. Add 
two cupfuls of boiling water, and cook in a double boiler, stirring 
constantly, for ten minutes after the boil begins. Flavor with 
vanilla or other extract when cold. Before using, beat for three 
minutes hard. 



582 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

This "dressing" is especially nice if a few spoonfuls of whipped 
cream be beaten into it just before serving. It should be very 
cold, or very hot. If the latter, omit the whipped cream but 
froth by heating over the fire. 

Strawberry sauce for vanilla cream 

Crush a pint of berries, mix with them a cupful of sugar ; stir 
until dissolved; strain through a fine colander or a vegetable 
press, and set on ice until needed. 

Hot maple sauce for vanilla ice cream 

Boil a pound of maple sugar with a very little water until it 
begins to "thread." Then stir into it a half a cupful of shelled 
English walnuts, broken, not chopped, into bits. There should 
be enough to make the sauce quite thick. Pour hot over vanilla 
ice cream. 

Chocolate ice cream 

Make a custard according to the directions given in the recipe 
for vanilla ice cream, stirring into it, while in cooking, four table- 
spoonfuls of grated chocolate. When this chocolate custard is 
cold beat in a pint of rich cream and freeze. 



Burnt almond ice cream 

Beat the yolks of four eggs light, add to them a cupful of sugar 
and a pint of hot milk. Put over the fire in a double boiler, cook 
until the mixture thickens like a custard, take from the fire, whip 
in the whites of the eggs, beaten stiff, and when the mixture is 
cold stir in lightly half a pint of sweet cream, whipped stiff, a 
cupful of almonds, which have been shelled, blanched, chopped 
fine, browned in two teaspoonfujs of caramel sugar, and pounded 
to a coarse powder. Flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla and 
half a teaspoonful of almond extract. Freeze as you would other 
ice cream. - ' ' .

ICE CREAM AND ICES 583 

Pistachio ice cream 

Blanch a quarter of a pound of pistachio nuts by pouring boil- 
ing water over them, letting them stand in this for ten minutes 
and slipping off the skins. Grind to a powder or pound to a 
paste, adding a few drops of cream in the latter case. Have 
ready a custard as for vanilla ice cream, made of six eggs, a 
quart of milk and a pound of sugar, and after this is cooked to a 
custard, and cold, add a quart of rich cream, the pistachio nuts 
and enough green vegetable paste to make it of the desired shade 
of green. Turn into the freezer and freeze. 

Maple frappe* 

Into two cupfuls of maple syrup stir a cupful of water and a 
cupful of rich cream, and freeze. Serve in punch-glasses with 
teaspoons. 

Nesselrode pudding 

Make a rich custard of eight eggs and a quart of milk ; stir into 
it a quart of rich cream, turn into a freezer and grind until half- 
frozen. Now open the freezer, remove the dasher and with a 
long-handled spoon beat into the cream a pound of chopped 
marrons glaces. Replace -the top of the freezer, pack down in ice 
and rock salt, and leave for three hours. Turn the pudding upon 
a chilled platter, and heap whipped cream about the base. 

Crushed strawberry ice cream 

Make a custard like the one for which directions are given in 
the last recipe, only doubling the quantity. Add a quart of 
cream and pour into the freezer. Grind or leave packed down 
until half-frozen. Have ready a quart of strawberries mashed 
and abundantly sweetened. When the ice cream is half con- 
gealed carefully remove the top from the freezer and with a long 
spoon beat in the crushed berries, stirring up the contents from 
the bottom. Replace the top and continue to grind until frozen. 

Red raspberries may be used in the same way. 



584 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Macaroon ice cream 

Spread a half-pound of macaroons on a pastry-board and with 
a rolling-pin crush them to a powder. 

Make a custard after the following manner : Heat a pint of 
milk to the scalding point and pour it gradually upon three eggs 
beaten light with one and a half cupfuls of granulated sugar. 
Put into a double boiler over the fire and stir until like thick 
cream; remove, and set aside to cool. When cold stir into this 
custard a pint of rich cream, the powdered macaroons and a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla extract. Turn into the freezer and grind 
until frozen. 

Macaroon mousse 

Make custard as in last recipe, but whip the cream, then beat 
the powdered macaroons well into it, pack an ice and freeze with- 
out grinding. 

The "mousse" or mossy effect is produced by freezing whipped 
cream without turning the crank. (See directions given at be- 
ginning of this chapter.) 

Strawberry mousse 

Whip a pint of thick cream very stiff and stir into it a cupful 
of crushed berries which have been sweetened abundantly and 
from which all of the juice has been drained. Mold and pack in 
ice and salt for four hours. When ready to serve, garnish with 
whole strawberries. 

Raspberry mousse 

Mash a quart of red raspberries and cover them with a pint of 
granulated sugar. Whip a quart of cream to a stiff froth, and 
beat it gradually into the mashed berries. Turn into the freezer. 
Do not grind, but pack in ice and cracked salt for three hours. 
This is delicious served with or without whipped cream. 

Peach ice cream (No. 1) 

Scald a pint of cream and pour it very gradually upon three 
eggs that have been beaten light with three cupfuls of sugar, Put 



ICE CREAM AND ICES 585 

over the fire in a double boiler and cook, stirring constantly until 
you have a custard that coats the spoon. This will take about fif- 
teen minutes. Set the custard aside until cold, then stir into it a 
pint of rich cream and three cupfuls of cut-up peaches. These 
peaches should not be peeled and cut until just before the time 
for freezing them, and must be cut into very small bits, and 
sprinkled abundantly with sugar. Stir custard, cream and peaches 
well together, turn all into the freezer and freeze until firm. If 
you freeze without grinding, beat the fruit in after the cream has 
been packed down for an hour. 

Peach ice cream (No. 2) 

Make a quart of rich ice cream and flavor with almond. 
When frozen hard take up and cut into cakes. Line the bottom 
and sides of the freezer with these. Reserve one-fourth for a 
cover. Fill the center with layers of sliced peaches and thick 
whipped cream. Cover with the reserved cream and let the 
freezer remain in ice and salt an hour. Dip quickly into warm 
water and turn out carefully. 

Cafe parfait 

Put together one quart of thick cream, one gill of clear, strong 
coffee and a cupful of fine white sugar. Whip all light in a cream 
churn, or with any other appliance you have for whipping cream. 
When stiff and light put into a mold that will fit in a freezer, and 
bind a strip of cloth or several folds of tissue paper about the top 
of the mold so as to keep the salt water from getting in. Put 
the mold into a freezer tub and surround it with fine ice and rock 
salt, well packed down. It should stand in this for at least three 
hours. As a rule it is served heaped in glasses or cups. 

Raspberry parfait 

With a silver spoon mash a quart of red raspberries and stir 
into them a pound of granulated sugar. Set in a cold place for 
several hours while you soak half a box of gelatine in a half a 



5 86 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

pint of cool water. When the gelatine has soaked for two hours 
turn it into a saucepan, pour over it a cupful of boiling water, 
and stir until dissolved. Rub the berries and sugar through a 
fine colander into the dissolved gelatine, and again set it in a cold 
place for an hour or two. Meanwhile, beat a pint of sweet cream 
stiff. (This will make about a quart of whipped cream.) When 
the gelatine mixture is cold beat the whipped cream into it, put 
into a freezer and freeze. 

Fruit meringue glace 

This is one of the simplest and most delicious of desserts and 
may be made of any kind of fruit that is at hand. It is espe- 
cially good when made of strawberries, red raspberries, or ripe 
peaches. 

Crush a quart of fruit to a pulp and cover it with a pint of 
granulated sugar. Pour on this a half pint of cold water and the 
unbeaten whites of five eggs. Mix and turn into the freezer. 
The grinding process will whip the contents into frozen foam, 
light yet firm. 

Orange and banana meringue glace 

Peel, seed and chop five oranges fine, and cover them with two 
cupfuls of granulated sugar. At the end of half an hour peel 
and chop five or six bananas, and stir immediately into the sugared 
oranges. Now add a pint of cold water and the unbeaten whites 
of five eggs. Turn into the freezer and grind until you have a 
frozen fruit froth. 

Strawberry surprise 

Mash two quarts of strawberries to a pulp, add to them a pint 
of sugar, a pint of water, the juice of two lemons and the unbeaten 
whites of six eggs. Turn into the freezer and freeze. The turr, - 
ing of the dasher will beat all to a foamy and delicious "surprise." 

Alaska bake (No. 1) 

Whites of six eggs. Six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. 
Two-quart brick of ice cream. A thin sheet of sponge cake. 



ICE CREAM AND ICES 587 

Make a meringue of the egg whites and the sugar, cover a 
board with white paper, lay on the sponge cake, turn the ice cream 
out upon the cake (which should extend one-half inch beyond the 
cream), cover with the meringue, and spread smoothly. Place 
on the oven grate and brown quickly. The board, paper, cake 
and meringue are poor conductors of heat and prevent the cream 
from melting. Slip from paper on ice cream platter. 

Alaska bake (No. 2) 

Cover thickly a two-quart brick mold of ice cream with a 
meringue made of the whites of six eggs and six tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar. 

Place the dish upon a board and set in a very quick oven to 
brown. The meringue acts as a non-conductor, and prevents the 
heat from melting the ice cream. 

It may also be browned with a salamander or a heated fire- 
shovel. 

Sherbet 

Squeeze all the juice from six lemons and one large orange. 
Put into this the grated rind of the orange, and of three of the 
lemons, and let it steep for an hour. Strain in a bag, squeezing 
this hard; add two cupfuls of granulated sugar and one pint of 
water. Mix well and put into a freezer. The length of time it 
will take to freeze depends upon the make of the freezer. Some 
require more time than others. 

Berry sherbet 

Mash one quart of berries, or enough to make one pint of juice ; 
add one pint of sugar, and after the sugar is dissolved, add one 
pint of water and the juice of one lemon. Press through coarse 
lace, or cheese cloth, and freeze. 

Tutti-frutti ice cream 

Break the whites of seven eggs into a chilled bowl, add to them 
two cupfuls of powdered sugar and a pint of rich cream into 



588 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

which you have stirred a bit of baking-soda the size of a pea. 
Put over the fire in a double boiler and make it scalding hot, but 
remove before the boiling point is reached. Now set the inner 
saucepan in a pan of ice, and churn until cold and light. Turn 
into the freezer and grind. Peel and cut into small bits three 
peaches, an apple, an orange, a banana, two dozen cherries (crys- 
tallized, if you can not get the fresh), and cut into small pieces a 
half cupful of red raspberries. Mix all these fruits thoroughly 
together. When the cream is frozen, but not very stiff, carefully 
wipe off the top of the freezer, remove the cover, and take out 
the dasher. Turn the mixed fruits into the cream, and with a 
long-handled spoon stir them in. Press all down hard, replace 
the cover, and pack the freezer down in ice and salt for three 
hours longer. 

Cherry ice 

Stem and stone a quart of cherries, crush and cover them with 
two cupfuls of sugar. At the end of an hour squeeze the cher- 
ries through a vegetable press and extract all the juice. To this 
add the juice of a lemon, a pint of water and the unbeaten whites 
of three eggs. Turn all into a freezer and grind until you have 
a firm, light ice. Pack the freezer in ice and salt for an hour after 
the dasher is removed. 

Whole banana ice cream 

Wash and wipe twelve large ripe red bananas, cut the skins 
down carefully all the length on one side, and as carefully extract 
the pulp without breaking the skins. Remove the pulp, scrape 
out the fibrous portion from the skins and put the latter in the 
ice-chest until the cream is ready. Mash the pulp of the bananas, 
mix with it two cupfuls of sugar and one quart of cream, and add 
two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice. Rub through your colander 
to get rid of fibrous parts, and freeze in the usual way. When 
almost hard, fill the banana skins with the cream, packing 
it in well, tie with soft thread and return to the cleaned and chilled 
freezer. Freeze for another hour (without turning). Have 



ICE CREAM AND ICES 589 

ready a dozen narrow green ribbons. Remove the threads quick- 
ly, tie the bananas up with the ribbons ; lay back in a freezer when 
you have wiped it dry, and leave in ice and rock salt until you 
are ready to serve. 

Plum Bavarian cream 

Soak half a box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water. Press 
through a sieve one pint of canned, or freshly stewed and sweet- 
ened plums. Stir the gelatine over boiling water until dissolved ; 
stir the plums into this and mix well ; pour into a bowl set in 
ice, and stir constantly until it begins to thicken ; then add one 
pint of whipped cream ; stir lightly until well mixed. Turn into 
a mold and stand in a cool place to harden. Serve with whipped 
cream. 

Cider ice 

Dissolve one and a half cupfuls of granulated sugar in one 
quart of cider. Add one cupful of orange juice and one- fourth 
cupful of lemon juice. Mix the ingredients well together and 
freeze in the usual manner. 

Raspberry and currant cream 

Mash one quart of black raspberries and one pint of red cur- 
rants with two and a half cupfuls of sugar. Let them stand sev- 
eral hours, strain off the juice and turn into the freezer. When 
partly frozen, add one cupful of sweet cream, sweetened, flavored 
and whipped. 



HOME-MADE CANDIES 

THERE has of late years been so much criminal adulteration of 
candy that the cautious parent is tempted to condemn all bonbons 
as unfit for human stomachs. In our wholesale condemnation 
we are prone to forget that the longing for sweets is a natural 
craving of the system, and that pure sugar, taken in moderation 
and at the proper time, is not injurious, but rather aids in the 
process of digestion. 

A moderate amount of good candy eaten directly after a hearty 
meal should not prove injurious to any healthy person. 

Appreciation of this hygienic law has led to the introduction of 
the bonbonniere upon the luncheon and the dinner table. The 
sweet morsels are nibbled because it is fashionable to partake of 
them, but the good results are the same as if intelligent compre- 
hension of need and supply were the motive power. 

Maple candy 

Break a pound of maple sugar into bits and then crush it fine 
with a rolling-pin. Stir it into two cupfuls of hot milk ; put over 
the fire, and stir until the sugar is melted. Now boil hard, 
stirring all the time, until the syrup is brittle when dropped into 
cold water ; beat in a lump of butter the size of a small hen's egg, 
and as soon as this melts, pour the candy into greased pans. 
Cut into large squares before it hardens. 

Maple caramels 

Break two pounds of maple sugar into a quart of milk half 
cream, if you have it and boil steadily, until a little dropped into 
cold water, hardens. Pour into greased pans, and as it cools, 
mark into squares.

HOME-MADE CANDIES 591 

Maple fudge 

Break a pound of maple sugar into small pieces and put it over 
the fire with a cupful of milk. Bring to a boil, add a tablespoon- 
ful of butter and cook until a little dropped into cold water be- 
comes brittle. Take from the fire, stir until it begins to granulate 
a little about the sides of the pot, and then pour into a greased pan. 
Mark into squares with a knife. 

Sugar candy 

Wet two heaping cupfuls of granulated sugar with a half pint 
of cold water and put over the fire in a porcelain-lined saucepan. 
When the sugar is dissolved, stir in a bit of cream of tartar (as 
large as a Lima bean) dissolved in a spoonful of cold water. 
Boil the candy until a bit hardens when dropped into cold water ; 
remove from the fire, stir in a teaspoonful of vanilla, turn into 
greased pans, mark into squares and set aside to harden. Or, as 
the candy cools, pull it with buttered finger-tips into long white 
ropes. Let it get very cold and brittle before eating. 

Chocolate fudge (No. 1) 

Boil together a cupful of sugar, one cupful of grated chocolate, 
one-half cupful of milk, one-quarter of a cupful of molasses. 
Boil, stirring often, until a little hardens in cold water. Remove 
from the fire, beat in a teaspoonful of vanilla, stir for a minute 
and turn into a buttered pan. 

Chocolate fudge (No. 2) 

Three pounds of light brown sugar, one half pound of choco- 
late, one-half cupful of cream, one-quarter pound of butter, three 
tablespoonfuls of vanilla extract. 

Put all into a porcelain kettle, or smooth iron pot, excepting 
the vanilla extract. Set on the back of the stove and let it melt 
slowly two hours are none too long, if you value smooth, rich 
Then pull forward to boil about ten minutes. Try, at the 



592 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

end of seven or eight minutes, in ice-cold water, and if it "balls" 
in the fingers, take off and beat, adding the vanilla. Turn out 
into buttered tins, and score when cool enough. 

Penotchie 

Put over the fire in a saucepan three cupfuls of light brown 
sugar not coffee sugar with a cupful of milk and boil to the 
stage when dropped into cold water it makes a soft but firm ball 
in the fingers. Add, then, a teaspoonful of butter ; take from the 
fire, flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla and stir in a cupful of 
kernels of English walnuts, hickory nuts, or pecans, broken into 
pieces. Turn out upon a well-buttered shallow pan and mark 
into squares with a buttered knife. 

This is sometimes known as "Penuchie," sometimes as "Mexi- 
can Kisses." 

Molasses candy (No. 1) 

Stir together three cupfuls of New Orleans molasses and a 
cupful of brown sugar. Add a gill of vinegar and put all over the 
fire in a porcelain-lined saucepan. Bring slowly to a boil and 
stir the syrup often as it cooks. Test the candy, from time to 
time, by dropping a bit into iced water. As soon as this bit 
hardens stir into the boiling syrup a heaping teaspoonful of but- 
ter; when this melts, add a teaspoonful of baking-soda dissolved 
in a tablespoonful of boiling water, and remove immediately from 
the fire. Pour into buttered tins and cut into diamond-shaped 
candies, or pull into ropes. 

This is the good old-fashioned molasses candy of "candy pulls" 
the frolics dear to our mothers' girlish days. In my opinion it 
is sweeter to taste and to memory than chocolate creams or any 
other modern bonbon. 

Molasses candy (No. 2) 

Boil together a cupful of molasses, one of brown sugar, a table- 
spoonful of butter and a tablespoonful of vinegar. When a drop 
hardens in cold water remove from the fire, beat in a small tea- 



HOME-MADE CANDIES 593 

spoonful of baking-soda, stir hard, and turn into buttered pans. 
As it hardens, cut into squares, or when hard break into bits. 

Molasses "velvets" 

One cupful of molasses, three cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of 
boiling water, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of cream of tartar, one-half cupful of melted butter, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of soda. Pour the first four ingredients into 
a kettle placed over the front of the range. As soon as the boil- 
ing point is reached add cream of tartar. Boil until, when tried 
in cold water, the mixture will harden and crisp. Stir constantly 
during the last half hour of cooking. When nearly done add the 
butter and soda. Pour into a buttered pan and pull as you would 
plain molasses candy. Before pulling add one teaspoonful of 
vanilla, one-half teaspoonful of lemon extract, or any essence you 
may prefer. 

Molasses taffy 

Boil a pint of molasses for twenty minutes, then stir in two 
saltspoonfuls of baking-soda and boil for fifteen minutes more, 
or until a little dropped into cold water is brittle. You must stir 
the taffy constantly while boiling, or it will scorch. When it is 
done add a teaspoonful of vinegar and pour into buttered pans, 
or pull to a light brown. 

Molasses walnut candy 

Boil a quart of molasses for half an hour, then add a saltspoon- 
ful of baking-soda and boil until a little dropped into cold water 
becomes brittle. Stir in shelled and halved walnuts, and pour 
into a greased pan. 

Molasses stick candy 

Boil together a pint of molasses, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
a pound of brown sugar and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. When 
a little hardens in iced water remove from the fire, and, as it cools, 
pull into long light strips with floured finger-tips. Lay on waxed 
paper to harden.

Chocolate caramels (No. 1) 

Heat together over a slow fire two cupfuls of brown sugar, half 
a cupful of molasses, half a cupful of cream, four tablespoonfuls 
of butter, and half a cake of Baker's unsweetened chocolate, 
grated. Cool until it is brittle when dropped into cold water ; 
flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla, turn into a greased pan, and 
when cool cut into squares with a knife. 

Chocolate caramels (No. 2) 

Boil together two pounds of granulated sugar, a quarter of a 
pound of grated chocolate, a half pint of milk, a quarter of a 
pound of butter. Cook until a bit hardens when dropped into 
cold water, flavor with vanilla, pour into greased tins and mark 
into squares. 

Opera caramels 

Stir into two cupfuls of granulated sugar just enough milk to 
dissolve it, add a quarter teaspoonful of cream of tartar and put 
over a slow fire. Stir constantly while boiling until a little 
dropped into cold water has the consistency of putty. Pour into 
a shallow pan and set aside to cool until so stiff that your finger 
pressed on it leaves a dent. Now beat until you have a soft, 
dough-like mass. Knead this, put upon a pastry board sprinkled 
with powdered sugar, and roll into a sheet a half inch thick. 
Cut into squares. If you wish to make vanilla caramels of these 
stir in the vanilla just before taking the mixture from the fire. 

Chocolate creams 

Beat the white of an egg light with a teaspoonful of sugar, 
add a teaspoonful of vanilla and enough confectioner's sugar to 
make a mixture stiff enough to be rolled into balls. Beat very 
smooth, then form into balls the size of a small marble, and spread 
in a pan to get stiff and firm. Cover with a chocolate coating. 



HOME-MADE CANDIES 595 

Chocolate coating for creams 

Melt sweetened chocolate in a double boiler. Run a thick 
skewer into each cream ball and dip in the melted chocolate until 
thoroughly coated. Spread on buttered tins to dry; or, spread 
upon waxed paper. 

Chocolate marshmallows 

Buy two ounces of finely powdered white gum arabic and let it 
stand, covered with eight tablespoonfuls of cold water, for an 
hour. Put it then into a double boiler, and let it heat slowly until 
the gum is dissolved. Strain through a cheese-cloth, wash out 
the double boiler and return the gum arabic to this with seven 
ounces of powdered sugar and two tablespoonfuls of grated 
chocolate. Stir over the fire for about three-quarters of an hour. 
At the end of this time the mixture should be stiff. Take from 
the fire, beat rapidly for two minutes, put in a teaspoonful of 
vanilla, and pour into a pan which has been well dusted with 
corn-starch. When cold cut into squares. 

Fondant for cream candies 

To one pound of granulated sugar put into a granite saucepan, 
add a gill and a half of boiling water, and stir until the sugar is 
dissolved no longer. Let the syrup boil about six minutes, and 
dip a fork into it. Try this, holding up the fork and watching 
the syrup on the point, until this has reached a stage where it 
spins a thread. Test it still further by dropping a little of the 
boiling sugar into iced water. When it can be made into a very 
soft ball with the fingers, turn it out on a large platter, which has 
been lightly buttered. Be careful not to stir the sugar when 
boiling, and do not scrape off the sugar that adheres to the side of 
the saucepan. As soon as the syrup in the dish is blood-warm, 
stir it with a wooden spoon, or paddle, until it begins to crumble. 
It should be a smooth white mass, and when it has come to this 
stage should be kneaded in the hands like dough. Pack it into a 
bowl, cover it with a thin cloth, slightly moistened, and set it away 
until needed. 



596 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Chop nuts and roll in this fondant, or roll in it whole. Citron 
cut into strips may be coated with it. 

Cream dates 

Stone dates, opening at one side only, fill with fondant, close 
gently into the original shape and sprinkle with sugar. 

Butterscotch 

Wet a pound of brown sugar with a cupful of water, into which 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar have been stirred. Put into an 
agate saucepan. Cook for ten minutes, add four tablespoonfuls 
of butter and boil until a drop hardens in cold water. Pour into 
large buttered tins, and as it cools, mark off into squares. 

Lemon butter 

Boil together half a pound of brown sugar, a tablespoonful of 
vinegar and a gill of water for ten minutes, and add a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter. Boil until the candy becomes brittle 
when dropped into cold water, and take from the fire. Add to it 
the juice of a lemon and pour into a shallow, well-greased pan. 

Hoarhound candy (made from fresh leaves) 

Make a strong solution of hoarhound leaves; strain this, and 
put a quarter of a cupful of it over the fire with a pound of brown 
sugar and a very little water. Cook until a little dropped in cold 
water is brittle. Add a tablespoonful of vinegar, boil up once and 
turn into greased tins. 

Hoarhound candy (made from dried leaves) 

Steep a heaping tablespoonful of dried hoarhound leaves in 
half a cupful of boiling water for one hour, then strain and 
squeeze. Add the liquid to two cupfuls of brown sugar, put over 
the fire in a saucepan, and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Put 
in a tablespoonful of vinegar and boil until the candy breaks 



HOME-MADE CANDIES 597 

when dropped into cold water. Drop from the point of the spoon 
upon buttered paper, or pour into a pan and cut into squares. 

Wintergreen candy 

Made as directed in last recipes, substituting wintergreen for 
hoarhound. 

Walnut creams 

Beat the whites of an egg very light with enough XXX sugar 
to make it very stiff. Now add cream, a few drops at a time, until 
the mixture is of the consistency of putty, working it with the 
hands until it is soft and smooth. Flavor with vanilla, or with 
lemon juice and the grated rind. Roll into small balls, flatten 
these, and press a half walnut on each side of every ball. 

French cream almonds 

Four cupfuls of granulated sugar ; one cupful of boiling water ; 
two tablespoonfuls of glucose. 

Stir until mixed and dissolved, then cover, and boil until the 
syrup strings. Pour into a crock and allow it to stand undis- 
turbed until cool enough for you to hold your finger in it. Stir 
with a wooden spoon until thick ; pour upon a marble slab and 
knead all lumps out. Work in flavoring and coloring if desired. 
Mold into balls and press a blanched almond on the top of each 
ball. 

Creamed English walnuts 

For this use the large English walnuts, cracking them carefully 
so as not to break the kernels. Remove each half in one piece 
and free it from all bits of shell. 

Heat over boiling water half a pound of fondant like that for 
which directions have been given in the recipe for chocolate 
creams. Flavor it with a teaspoonful of vanilla extract, stir it 
until it becomes creamy and dip into it with a pair of small sugar 
tongs the half of the walnut. Lift it out carefully and lay it on 
waxed paper until it is dry. 



598 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Or you may make a fondant of another kind by mixing the 
white of an egg with an equal quantity of cold water and stirring 
into it enough confectioner's sugar of the variety known as "XXX" 
to make a dough-like past that can be handled with the ringers. 
This may be flavored to taste with vanilla or bitter almond, or 
any other extract, and formed with the fingers into small balls. 
To each side of this may be pressed the flat surface of an English 
walnut kernel. They may then be laid on waxed paper in a box. 

Peanut candy 

Boil together two and one-half cupfuls of sugar and a gill of 
water, without stirring, until a little, when dropped into cold 
water, can be worked into a soft ball. Now add a tablespoonful 
of butter and boil until the candy hardens when dropped into 
cold water. Stir in a cupful of shelled, roasted and skinned pea- 
nuts, turn the mixture into a buttered pan and cut into squares. 

Peanut molasses candy 

Boil together a cupful, each, of molasses and brown sugar, a 
tablespoonful of vinegar and two of butter. When a little, 
dropped into cold water, is brittle, add a cupful of shelled, roasted 
and skinned peanuts, remove at once from the fire, add a teaspoon- 
ful (scant) of baking-soda, beat hard, and pour into buttered 
pans. 

Nougat 

Boil together a pound of sugar and a half cupful of cold water 
until it becomes brittle if dropped into cold water. Cover the 
bottom 'of a well-buttered shallow tin with nut kernels hickory, 
walnut and pecans, blanched almonds, strips of cocoanut, bits of 
figs, dates and the like. Add a tablespoonful of lemon juice to 
the candy when it is done, and pour it over the fruit and nuts in 
the pan. Let it get cold and mark into squares and strips. 



HOME-MADE CANDIES 599 

Creamed burnt almonds 

Put two cupfuls of granulated sugar into a saucepan with two 
tablespoonfuls of water, set over the fire and stir continually with 
a wooden spoon. As soon as it is well melted, move it to one side 
of the fire, drop in the blanched almonds, and take them out at 
once with a perforated spoon, or candy dipper. Lay them on 
buttered dishes to harden. 

Creamed grapes 

Make a syrup of a pound of sugar and a gill of water. Boil 
without stirring until a drop put into iced water becomes brittle. 
Remove from the fire, set in an outer pan of boiling water, and 
add to the syrup a dessertspoonful of lemon juice. Run a stiff 
wire or the prong of a pickle fork through each grape, and dip 
them, one by one, in the hot syrup, then lay on waxed paper to dry. 

Creamed popcorn 

Make a syrup as for creamed grapes in the recipe given above, 
but omit the lemon juice. Drop into the syrup enough crisp pop- 
corn to make it thick; take out this, after stirring for half a 
minute, by the great spoonful and lay on greased paper. As the 
mass hardens roll a spoonful of it into a ball, then roll this over 
and over in freshly popped and sugared corn, until the white 
kernels adhere to the sticky ball. 

Popcorn balls 

Make an old-fashioned molasses candy, and just before remov- 
ing from the fire, stir in enough popcorn to thicken it. Take the 
mixture out by the spoonful and roll, as soon as it can be handled, 
into balls, then roll these over and over in kernels of popcorn until 
no more will adhert xo the balls. 

Sugared peanuts 

Prepare as you would salted nuts, but substitute butter for 
oil, and fine sugar for salt, after you have rolled the nuts in the 



600 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

white of an egg, beaten light. Spread out upon white paper to 
dry in the sun, or in a moderate oven. 

Orange straws 

Select thick-skinned oranges, and cut the peel in strips a quar- 
ter inch wide. Have a pan of boiling water on the stove, and 
place as many pieces of the peel in the water as you can easily 
handle. Let it boil five minutes, drain, cover again with boiling 
water, boil five minutes more, drain again, once more cover with 
boiling water and boil five minutes, making fifteen in all. Drain 
thoroughly, then -make a syrup of one teacupful of sugar to three 
tablespoonfuls of water ; when this boils add the peel, and cook 
until this is absorbed (about twenty minutes) ; remove from the 
pan, and, while hot, roll each straw in granulated sugar which you 
have placed previously upon clean paper. Then put each straw 
on paper in a pan until the bottom of the pan is covered, and place 
in a warm oven until all are dry. Have the sugar to roll the 
straws in and all ingredients ready before beginning the cooking, 
as the straws must be handled very rapidly. They will keep for 
weeks and not become sticky. One cup of sugar will do for five 
oranges. 

Candied orange peel 

When peeling the orange cut the rind into quarters, then cut 
into long strips. Put into a pan, cover with cold water, bring 
to the boil and drain. To six oranges allow one and a half cup- 
fuls of granulated sugar and a cupful of water; put these into 
a granite saucepan and bring to a hard boil. Add the orange 
peel and boil down quickly, taking care not to burn. When the 
liquid is almost cooked away take the saucepan off the stove and 
stir in a cupful of sugar. Stir until almost cold, pick apart with 
the fingers, and lay on a plate. 

Candied pineapple 

Peel, slice and weigh the pineapple, and allow a pound and a 
half of granulated sugar to each pound of fruit. Put the fruit 



HOME-MADE CANDIES 601 

and sugar together in a granite kettle and add just enough water 
to cover the fruit. Boil until the fruit is tender, remove and 
spread on a dish to cool while you boil the syrup until very thick. 
Now lay in the pineapple ; cook and stir for five minutes more, and 
then spread the sliced fruit on platters until dry and "candied." 

Candied citron 

Peel and core the citron and cut into strips. Weigh the fruit, 
and allow a pound of sugar to each pound of the citron strips. 
Make a syrup, allowing a cupful of water to each po'und of sugar. 
Cook the citron in this until it is tender; remove and spread on 
dishes. Boil in the syrup enough ginger to give a slight flavor, 
and when the syrup is very thick stir in a little lemon juice. Now 
lay the strips of citron back in the syrup, and stir until candied 
and coated with sugar. Lay on a platter to cool and dry. 

Marshmallows 

Soak four ounces of pulverized gum arabic in a teacupful of 
cold water for two hours. Put into a double boiler with cold 
water in the outer vessel and bring gradually to the scalding point. 
When the gum is dissolved, strain through coarse muslin, return 
to the double boiler with a heaping cupful of powdered sugar, 
and stir steadily until the mixture is white and stiff. Remove 
from the fire, beat very hard for a minute and flavor with 
vanilla; beat a minute longer, and pour into tins, the insides of 
which have been rubbed with corn-starch. When the paste is 
cool cut it into squares of uniform size and turn each of these 
over and over in a mixture made of three parts corn-starch and 
one part powdered sugar. Keep packed in a tin box until wanted, 
as they soon dry if exposed to the air. 

Peanut brittle 

Boil together a cupful, each, of molasses and brown sugar, a 
tablespoonful of vinegar and two tablespoonfuls of butter. When 
a little dropped into cold water is brittle, add a cupful of blanched 



602 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

peanuts; remove at once from the fire, add a teaspoonful of 
baking-soda, beat hard, and pour into buttered pans. 

Hickory nut candy 

Prepare half a cupful of hickory nut kernels by chopping them. 
Boil together one cupful of "A" sugar, one-third of a cupful of 
water, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut until it makes 
a soft lump when tested in water. Remove from the fire and stir 
in the nuts. When it begins to look cloudy, pour by the spoonful 
into buttered tins. It will spread into flat cakes. 



Maple nut candy 

Butter a shallow tin and cover the bottom with butternut meats. 
Place on the cooler part of the stove one quart of maple sugar and 
one cupful of water. Cook slowly and test in water. When 
done, pour over the nut meats. Before it hardens, mark into 
squares. 

Crystallized fruits 

Make a syrup of a pound of sugar and a gill of water. Boil, 
without stirring, until a drop put into iced water becomes imme- 
diately brittle. Remove the saucepan from the fire and set it at 
once in an outer pan of boiling water. Add to the syrup the juice 
of a quarter of a lemon. Run the prongs of a sharp pickle fork 
through each piece of fruit to be candied, and dip it in the hot 
syrup. Lay on buttered or waxed paper to dry. 

Stuffed dates 

Remove the stones from dates and fill with a mixture made as 
follows : 

Put into an agate saucepan one cupful of granulated sugar and 
a gill of cold water, with half a saltspoonful of cream of tartar. 
Stir just long enough to dissolve the sugar, then boil, without 
touching, until a drop put into cold water can be formed into a 
soft ball. Remove. from the fire immediately, skim off every par- 



HOME-MADE CANDIES 603 

tide of crust, if there be any upon the surface of the syrup, and 
pour the syrup into a bowl. When so cool and thick that the 
finger leaves a dent when pressed upon it, stir with a wooden 
spoon to a smooth white paste. When too stiff to stir with a 
spoon, work the mixture with the hands. This filling will keep 
for weeks. When you wish to use it, set the cup containing it 
in a pan of hot water until soft enough to handle. 




AFTERNOON TEA 



IN every respectable English dwelling, be it palace or cottage, 
tea is served between four and five o'clock every afternoon in the 
year. The crone in the almshouse takes hers direct from the hob 
in winter, and in summer hobbles with her black teapot, a tea- 
spoonful of the precious leaves in the bottom, to the common 
kitchen to have it filled. Her betters in name and in worldly gear 
assemble about the tea equipage in drawing room or library, or 
in the family "parlor." 

For the wealthy there are tea-tables of divers patterns, some 
with leaves that draw out to accommodate cups and saucers when 
set in array. The conventional afternoon tea-table is lower than 
that intended to hold bric-a-brac and books. The chair occupied 
by the mistress of the house or one of her daughters is low and 
broad, that she may sit at her ease while making and dispensing 
the beverage. The central figure upon the tray is a teakettle of 
silver, copper, brass or lacquered Japanese ware, with 
a spirit lamp beneath. When the water boils the tea is 
"masked," i. e., a little is poured upon the dry leaves in 
the pot, a wadded "cozy" is fitted over the latter, and 
the tea is "drawn" for about two minutes before the rest of the 
water is added. 

The cups are passed by a servant if none of the young people 
of the family or intimate friends are present to whom the graceful 
task can be delegated. The tone of the whole function is easy 
sociability. 

This is especially marked in the English country house, where 

604 




AFTERNOON TEA 605 

sportsmen, who have been out with the dogs and gamekeeper 
all day, are allowed to drift into the drawing-room, in splashed 
gaiters and knickerbockers, for a chat and a cup of hot tea before 
going off to dress for dinner. 

As accompaniments to the tea we have a basket of light cakes 
or biscuits, thin bread and butter, now and then buttered scones 
or "tea cake." Anything more elaborate mars the simplicity of 
the custom, perverting it into an "occasion." It ceases to be 
afternoon tea, a rest station between the one o'clock luncheon 
and the seven or eight o'clock dinner. In some towns and cities 
particularly in the lavish South the effort to introduce this 
simplest of social functions has failed ignominiously, because 
like dish-washing, toast-making and tea-making, speaking the 
truth and spelling correctly the right way of doing it is too easy 
to learn. The "spread" of oysters, salads, cakes and creams, 
bouillon and bonbons, flummery and fruit, into which the im- 
ported custom degenerated, was as foreign to the true spirit of 
the original as the crush of elaborately dressed women and the 
sprinkle of uncomfortable men who attended the teas was to the 
cordial informality that should obtain with guests and enter- 
tainers. 

It is a wholesome symptom in our feverish social system that the 
beneficent break in the diurnal rush and press furnished by after- 
noon tea-time is becoming more and more prevalent. In tens of 
thousands of homes, in city and in country, five o'clock brings 
together the scattered parts of the home circle in the living-room. 
Jaunty wicker stands, three and four-storied, for holding plates 
of fancy biscuits, thin bread and butter, cake and crisp strips of 
lightly buttered toast spread with anchovy paste, have crept into 
conservative drawing-rooms ; teakettle, teapot and their appur- 
tenances appear duly at the stroke of the hour, and visitors who 
happen to call at that 'hour are cordially made welcome to the 
grateful refreshment. "Tea" is always there, no matter who 
comes or goes, and it typifies what we need more than all else 
besides in a land where labor is the rule and relaxation the ex- 
ception home joys, home comfort, home rest! 

Five o'clock tea has come to stay! Whether as a simple re- 



606 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

freshment for busy women who long for a life-saving station in 
the afternoon rush, or as an informal and inexpensive fashion 
of entertaining one's friends, it seems to be as firm a fixture on 
this side of the Atlantic as on the other. 

One of the chief charms of the afternoon tea is its adaptability. 
It may be as much or as little of a function as one chooses. I do 
not refer now to the cup of tea that the hostess pours for herself 
or the chance friend every afternoon in the week, but to the tea 
where guests are regularly invited. It may be madame's At 
Home day, which extends over a period of a few weeks, or runs 
through the whole winter, or it may be one of the more formal 
occasions, to which guests are invited in droves, and social debts 
thereby paid en bloc. 

For the simpler function it is easy to lay down rules. Little 
is required for it. If it is to be a weekly affair for which cards 
are issued early in the season, it is foolish to plan an elaborate 
menu, and even worse than foolish, for it is in bad taste. The 
guest who goes to such a day, "at home," does not expect a 
"spread," and the hostess who offers too much makes life harder 
for the timid woman of small means who is not quite sure what is 
the correct thing, but is only positive that it must be expensive. 

For the ordinary one-day-every-week-all-winter afternoon tea 
there are many houses where one has only bread and butter or 
fancy biscuits and a simple cake. I know one woman who prides 
herself upon the quality of the doughnuts she serves at her after- 
noon teas, and they are the only sweets she has beyond a little 
dish of bonbons. To be sure, there are simple sandwiches or 
thin bread and butter, but further than this she does not go 
except for some special occasion. 

For such an Afternoon Tea the following menus are offered as 
suggestions :

Caviar Sandwiches Creamed Chicken Sandwiches

Te~, or Coffee, or Chocolate 




AFTERNOON-TEA ON THE VERANDA 



AFTERNOON TEA 607 

AFTERNOON TEA MENU. II 

Chicken and Celery Sandwiches Anchovy Toast 

Fancy Cakes 
Tea, or Coffee, or Chocolate 

These menus may be modified in many ways. Other varieties 
of sandwiches may be provided. Both tea and coffee, or tea and 
chocolate, may be offered. Plain cake may be supplied instead 
of the fancy cakes, and a good tea biscuit may be given instead of 
one kind of sandwiches. Little dishes of bonbons may stand by 
to supplement the feast. 

For these, as for the ordinary afternoon tea where there are no 
invited guests, the preparations are the same. The tea-table is 
not to be left standing fully equipped to gather dust when 
it is not in use. The cups and saucers and other tea plenishings 
are brought in on a tray and placed on the table. This may be 
a regular tea-table, or it may be the table one finds in every draw- 
ing-room where are piled the magazines and books of the day. 
These may be swept to one side to make space for the tray. The 
hostess may make the tea and pour it, or it may be brought in 
ready from the kitchen. 

When tea-time extends over the whole afternoon, a tea-ball 
will prove of value. Then each guest is sure of a fresh hot cup 
of tea, and while the alcohol lamp holds out to burn the supply 
will not fail. 

If there are a good many guests there may be a maid at hand 
to pass cups and offer the plates of sandwiches and sweets. But, 
as a rule, the affair is so informal that hostess and guests wait on 
themselves. 

With the cup and saucer there may be offered a plate, and some 
hostesses offer doilies as well, but this is not obligatory. The 
maid is chiefly needed to replenish the hot water, to take away 
empty cups and the like, and if she is within sound of the bell, it 
answers as well as though she were at the elbow of the hostess. 

When the tea is to be a larger and more formal function, mat- 
ters are differently arranged. In those cases where a hostess 



608 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

gives perhaps two days, and invites all her dear five hundred 
friends to be present at one or the other of them, there is not 
room in the drawing-room for the tea-table nor place for the 
chatty informality of the simpler afternoon tea. The table is 
laid in the dining-room, or the library, and a friend is invited to 
"pour." If there are two beverages, as there are, almost in- 
variably, one friend takes each end of the table, and there may 
be even a third, presiding over another hot drink, or over the 
punch bowl. A waitress or two must be at hand to take away the 
dishes that have been used and bring fresh, and to see that the 
guests have enough to eat and drink. The hostess has no time to 
see to anything beyond the salutations of the guests as they come 
in, and can only suggest to them that they go out to the dining- 
room and find something to eat. 

Once in a while, a hostess will give no more than is contained 
in the menus already suggested, except that the supplies of all 
kinds may be increased, and that there may be three kinds of 
sandwiches, instead of one or two, and a larger choice in the 
matter of cake. Two hot drinks, at least, must be supplied. 

But in so large a function the bill of fare is more likely to be 
something like the followin~:

When an afternoon tea gets to this stage it may still be called 
"a tea," but it has gone far beyond that, and has become a day- 
time reception. Even if the sun is shining outside there is usu- 
ally artificial light in the rooms. The lamps are burning with 
a pleasant subdued light, there are candles with colored shades, 
the women who are receiving and presiding over the table are in 
full dress. The table itself is beautiful with china and cut glass 



AFTERNOON TEA 609 

and silver. Flowers are about everywhere, and except that the 
men are in morning dress and the women guests in street costume, 
it might be an evening party. 

There is a reception held in the afternoon that is even more 
elaborate than this. When a woman wants to make signal some 
special "occasion," to honor a guest, or perhaps because it is 
the only "crush" she gives in the year, she often makes it a tea. 
For this the cards will be out ten days or more in advance and 
the refreshments provided are more elegant and numerous than 
those mentioned above. Such a collation might be as follows : 

AFTERNOON TEA MENU. IV 

Bouillon 

Chicken or Lobster Salad Creamed Oysters 

Nut Sandwiches Sardine Sandwiches 

Cream Cheese Sandwiches 
Olives or Pim-olas Salted Nuts Bonbons 

Ices Frappe Cakes 

Tea Coffee Chocolate Punch 

The table is arranged for this as for the third tea mentioned, 
but there must be waiters in attendance, and they serve nearly 
everything. In most cases there is nothing done by the young 
women friends of the hostess who gather in the din- 
ing-room except entertain the guests and see that they 
have enough to eat. Once in a while, these young 
women may preside at the coffee-urn, or the chocolate, 
or teapot, but it is not a common occurrence. 

The matter has been put into the hands of "the pro- 
fession." 

It is all very nice, and an excellent way to clear the debit side 
of one's social ledger, but the mind turns to the quiet afternoon 
tea-table with the hot tea under the cozy, the saucer /of sliced 
lemon, the tiny flask of rum or the graceful cream jug, the sugar 
basin and plate of sandwiches, or bread and butter, with affection 
one never cherishes for the huge kettledrum.

SOME DAINTIES FOR AFTERNOON TEA 

Tea cakes 

Sift a quart of flour three times with two teaspoonfuls of 
baking-powder and one of salt. Chop into this a tablespoonful 
of butter and one of cottolene or other fat. 

(In all preparations requiring shortening, cottolene is prefera- 
ble to lard.) 

Mix in a bowl with a wooden spoon, adding about three cup- 
fuls of milk, or enough to make a soft dough. Turn out upon 
your board and roll, with swift, light strokes into a sheet half an 
inch in thickness. Reverse a jelly-cake tin upon the sheet and 
cut with a sharp knife cakes just the size of the tin. With a spat- 
ula, transfer to a floured baking-pan and bake in a quick oven. 

Split while hot, butter and cut into triangular pieces, six to 
each cake. Do not divide them until the triangles are drawn 
from the plate by those who are to eat them. 

Tea scones 

Mix as directed in recipe for tea cakes, but cut into rounds 
with a small biscuit cutter. Bake upon a soapstone griddle, upon 
both sides, to a delicate brown ; split and butter while hot. Line 
a plate or a tray with a napkin, lay in the scones and fold the 
corners of the napkin lightly over them. 

Oatmeal scones 

To three cupfuls of oatmeal add one of white flour, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and two of baking-powder. Heat three cupfuls of milk 
to scalding, not to boiling, stir in a tablespoonful of sugar with 

610 



DAINTIES FOR AFTERNOON TEA 611 

two and a half of butter, and mix with a wooden spoon these 
ingredients into a soft dough. 

Do not touch it with your hands. 

Turn out upon a kneading-board, roll into a sheet less than a 
quarter of an inch thick, cut into rounds with a large biscuit- 
cutter, and bake upon a hot soapstone griddle, turning to brown. 
Butter while hot. 

Virginia wafers 

Rub two tablespoonfuls of butter into a pint of flour, add 
enough iced water to make a stiff dough, put up on a floured pas- 
try board, and roll out as thin as writing paper in rounds as 
large as a saucer. Bake in a floured pan in a quick oven. 

They should be rough and "bubbly" on top. Eat cold. 

Corn-meal tea cakes 

Mix fine white corn-meal with boiling milk; gradually add a 
little salt, and let it simmer half an hour or more, then drop it 
from a large spoon upon a soapstone griddle, and bake on both 
sides to an even brown. Butter and eat hot. 

Bristol tea cakes 

Rub two level tablespoonfuls of butter into four cupfuls of 
sifted flour; mix it with thin cream to a soft dough to roll out; 
toss the dough upon a floured board, cut with a biscuit cutter 
into rounds and bake on a hot griddle, or in the oven ; split and 
butter them ; serve on a napkin. 

Raisin bread 

Make as you would ordinary white bread, with the addition of 
one-half cupful of raisins to a small loaf. Spread thin, triangular 
slices of this with butter, and then with a layer of cream cheese. 



612 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Hot milk tea cakes 

Into three well-whipped eggs beat a cupful of sugar, a large 
cupful of prepared flour, and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat hard ; 
add a gill of scalding hot milk, stir in quickly and turn the mix- 
ture into greased pate-pans. These cakes are best if eaten hot, 
but are also good cold. 

Stuffed rolls 

Light rolls, shaped like ringer rolls, but larger, may be cut 
open on one side, the crumb dug out and the cavity filled with 
minced and seasoned chicken, turkey, ham, or tongue. Close 
the roll and bind it with narrow ribbon tied with a bow and float- 
ing ends. You may tie the ham rolls with one color, the chicken 
with another. 

Peanut crisps 

One cupful of roasted and chopped peanuts, one cupful of 
powdered sugar, one tablespoonful of flour and the whites of two 
eggs. The mixture is dropped on a buttered paper and baked 
to a light brown in a moderate oven. A quart of unshelled pea- 
nuts will yield the necessary cupful of chopped nuts. 

Salted almonds 

Shell and blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water over 
them, letting them stand for ten minutes, then stripping off the 
skins. Dry the nuts between the folds of a clean dish towel, and 
put them in a baking-pan with a tablespoonful of melted butter. 
Turn them over and over in this until all are coated, then set the 
pan in the oven until the nuts are delicately browned, stirring 
often, that all may brown evenly. Turn into a colander, strew 
thickly with fine salt, and shake the colander hard to dislodge 
superfluous salt and grease. When cold, the nuts will be crisp. 
Keep in a dry place. 



DAINTIES FOR AFTERNOON TEA 613 

Peanut butter for sandwiches 

Shell and skin freshly-roasted peanuts and pound or grind 
them to a fine powder. Mix to a smooth paste, with half as much 
butter as you have peanut powder. If the butter is rather fresh, 
add a little salt. 

Cream cheese for sandwiches 

Into a broad pan pour the fresh warm milk as soon as possible 
after it is milked; set at the side of the range and bring slowly 
to the point where it just begins to simmer. Remove at once 
and set in the ice-box, where it will cool suddenly, and leave it 
there for six or eight hours. Now skim and press the clotted 
cream into small jars or deep saucers. Sprinkle the top of the 
cream with fine salt, and cover. Keep in a cold place until wanted. 

Marguerites 

The white of one egg, partly beaten ; two tablespoonf uls of 
sugar, and one-half cupful of chopped walnuts. Stir all together 
and spread on wafers, or upon long narrow crackers. Bake to a 
light brown. 

Ham and chicken sandwiches 

Into a pint of cold boiled or roast chicken, chopped very fine, 
stir a cupful of minced ham ; season with a few minced olives, 
and moisten with salad oil. Add white pepper to taste, and spread 
between thin slices of crustless white bread, buttered lightly. 

Cheese and olive sandwiches 

Mix cream cheese and chopped olives together; spread very 
thin slices of bread with the mixture ; serve on a folded napkin. 

Egg and olive sandwiches 

Boil six eggs hard, remove the shells and chop the eggs very, 
very fine. Stone and chop eighteen large olives, and mix these 



614 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

with the minced egg. Moisten all with a little melted butter, 
season to tas'te and mix to a moist paste. Spread on thin slices 
of crustless bread, and press the two halves of the sandwich 
firmly together. 

Lettuce and cream cheese sandwiches 

Cut white bread into very thin slices and remove the crusts, 
then butter lightly. Spread with Philadelphia cream cheese. Dip 
a leaf of crisp lettuce in a French salad dressing, and lay it upon 
a slice of the bread, then press another slice upon it. With a sharp 
pair of scissors trim off the projecting leaf of lettuce. Pile these 
sandwiches on a plate, cover and keep in the ice-box until wanted. 



FRAPPE BEVERAGES 

A PLEASANT custom prevalent at many summer afternoon teas 
is that of passing nearly frozen beverages for the refreshment 
and delectation of the guests. These glaces or frappes are so 
easily prepared that the veriest tyro in the ice-making art need 
not be afraid to attempt them. On a warm day they are a refresh- 
ing variety upon the conventional cup of tea, and are so light 
and innocuous as not to interfere with the enjoyment of the din- 
ner which must come an hour or two later. These ices are served 
in glasses, and with spoons. 

Cafe* frappe 

Put two cupfuls of finely-ground coffee into a large French 
coffee-pot, or biggin, and pour upon it two quarts of boiling 
water. When this has dripped through the strainer, pour it into 
a pitcher and turn it back into the strainer. Repeat this process 
four times, then pour the clear coffee into a bowl, and stir into 
it two large cupfuls of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is 
dissolved and set aside to cool. When cold, add the unbeaten 
whites of two eggs, turn into a freezer and grind until frozen, 



DAINTIES FOR AFTERNOON TEA 615 

but still rather soft. When turned into a glass it should be of 
about the consistency of soft snow. This rule of consistency 
applies to all these frozen beverages. 

Tea frapp6 

Scald a china teapot, put into it six teaspoonfuls of the best 
mixed tea and pour upon it eight cupfuls of freshly-boiling water. 
Let this stand for six or eight minutes, strain it into a bowl, and 
sweeten to taste. When cold, turn into the freezer. 

Frosted lemonade 

Boil together for fifteen minutes two quarts of water, and four 
cupfuls of granulated sugar. Remove from the fire and when the 
syrup is lukewarm, add the juice of a dozen lemons. Set aside 
until cold, then freeze. 

Frozen orangeade 

Mix together the juice from six oranges and two lemons. Boil 
together three cupfuls of water and one cupful of sugar for ten 
minutes ; remove from the fire and add the orange and lemon 
juice. When cold, add the unbeaten white of one egg, and freeze. 

Frozen raspberry juice 

Mash two quarts of red raspberries and cover them with three 
heaping cupfuls of granulated sugar. Let this stand in a warm 
place for an hour, then press through a cheese-cloth bag or a 
vegetable press to extract all the juice. To this add the juice of 
three lemons and of one orange, and two quarts of cold water. 
Stir well together and freeze. Some persons put a spoonful of 
whipped cream upon each glass of this ice. The contrast of the 
white with the pink is very pretty. 



616 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Ginger ale frappe" 

Open three bottles of imported ginger ale and turn the con- 
tents into a bowl. Add the juice of four lemons and a half cup- 
ful of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved ; turn the 
mixture into a freezer, and freeze. This ice is very refreshing. 

WAFERS 

Graham wafers 

Sift three cupfuls of graham flour and one cupful of white 
flour with a heaping teaspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder. Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter with one of 
sugar in a pint of scalding milk. Make a hole in the middle of 
the flour, and pour this in. Stir to a soft dough, turn upon a 
floured pastry-board, roll out quickly and lightly into a thin sheet, 
cut into rounds with a biscuit-cutter, and bake in a floured baking 
pan until brown and crisp. While hot, spread lightly with butter. 

Lemon wafers 

Cream a cup of butter with two cups of sugar, work in two 
beaten eggs, a small cup of cold water and the grated rind and the 
juice of a large lemon. Add flour to make the dough stiff enough 
to roll out ; roll very thin, cut into rounds and bake. Orange wafers 
may be made in the same way. 

Vanilla wafers 

Cream a cup of butter with two cups of sugar, add three well- 
beaten eggs and vanilla to taste. Stir in just enough flour to 
make a soft dough that can be rolled. Roll very thin, cut into 
rounds, and bake. 

Peanut wafers 

Cream together four tablespoonfuls of butter and a half-cup of 
sugar. When this mixture is soft and creamy add the well- 
whipped yolks of two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of milk, a cup 
of roasted and ground peanuts, and enough flour to make a good 
dough. Roll into a thin sheet, cut into rounds and bake. 



STEWED FRUIT, PRESERVES, FRUIT JELLIES, 
MARMALADES, ETCETERA 

STEWED FRUIT 

Much of the excellence of stewed fruit depends upon the man- 
ner in which it is cooked. As it is served, in nine cases out of 
ten, it has a medicated "tang" that is far from agreeable pro- 
duced by the cooking of the sugar with the fruit. She who is 
familiar with this form of the sweetmeat alone has no concep- 
tion of how palatable a dessert it makes if properly prepared. 
Served with plain or sponge cake it is a convenient dessert for 
Sunday night's supper, or for the dainty family luncheon. But 
the housekeeper who would have her stewed fruit really good 
must be willing to be a little careful perhaps fussy in the prep- 
aration thereof. Apples that are a little tough, pears that are 
rather tasteless when raw, green or hard peaches and sour plums 
may, with the help of the stewing kettle and the housewife's 
ingenuity, be converted into tender, toothsome morsels. Use 
always an agate-iron or porcelain-lined preserving kettle, as the 
action of the acid upon tin or iron darkens the fruit. 

Nearly all fruits prepared according to recipes given herewith 
may be kept for months if sealed hot in glass cans, as one would 
can vegetables or unsweetened fruits. They are more whole- 
some than the pound-for-pound preserves. 

Stewed apples 

Peel and core firm apples, dropping them into cold water as 
you do so, that the color may be preserved. Put them over the 
fire with enough boiling water to cover them, and let them simmer 
gently until very tender, but not broken. With a perforated 



6i8 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

skimmer remove them carefully from the water and arrange 
them in a deep dish. Strain the liquor and return it to the fire, 
putting into it a large cupful of granulated sugar for every dozen 
apples you have cooked. Boil to a syrup, add the juice of one 
lemon and pour over the apples. Cover closely and set in a cold 
place until wanted. These apples will keep in the ice-box for 
several days. 

Steamed apples 

From a dozen medium-sized apples remove the peeling with 
a sharp knife, taking care to have the parings as thin as possible. 
Take out the cores ; put the apples, side by side, in a deep pudding- 
dish, and pour over them enough water almost to cover them. 
Invert a plate, or pan, over the pudding-dish, set it in the oven 
and steam the contents until each apple can be easily pierced with 
a fork. Remove from the oven and lay the apples carefully in 
a deep dish. Set the pudding-dish containing the liquor from the 
apples on top of the range, add to it a cupful of granulated sugar, 
and bring to a boil. Simmer for twenty minutes, then add a 
dash of grated nutmeg and a pinch, each, of mace and ground 
cloves. Boil to a syrup and pour over the apples. Eat cold. 

Stewed pears 

Peel and quarter a dozen large pears and remove the cores, 
laying the quartered fruit in cold water as you do so. Put them 
over the fire with a pint of boiling water and stew until tender. 
Remove the fruit and add to the liquor a cupful of sugar, a stick 
of cinnamon, one of mace, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. 
Boil until thick, strain the syrup and pour it over the pears. 
Cover closely until they are cold. Seckel pears, peeled and stewed 
whole according to this recipe, are delicious. 

Stewed peaches 

Peel and stone three dozen peaches. Put them over the fire 
with enough boiling water to cover them and put into the- water 
six peach-pits (crushed) and two slices of pineapple cut into 



STEWED FRUIT, PRESERVES, ETCETERA 619 

Stew slowly, and when the peaches are tender transfer 
them to a bowl while you boil the liquor hard for five minutes, then 
strain it and add three cupfuls of granulated sugar. Boil to a 
thick syrup and pour over the peaches. Cover while cooking. 

Stewed plums 

Wipe each plum carefully with a soft damp cloth, and prick 
it with a fork to prevent bursting. Have the water in the preserv- 
ing kettle a little more than lukewarm and lay the fruit in it. 
Bring to a gentle boil, cook just long enough for the plums to 
become tender, but not long enough for the skins to crack. They 
must be watched carefully. Remove to a deep dish, add a cupful 
of granulated sugar to every quart of liquor, boil to a syrup and 
pour over the plums. 

Apple sauce 

Wash two dozen firm, juicy apples and cut them without 
peeling into pieces. Put them into a porcelain-lined saucepan 
with a cupful of cold water and bring to a boil. Cook steadily, 
stirring frequently, until the fruit is soft and broken into bits. 
Remove from the fire and run through a colander to free the 
sauce from all bits of skin. Sweeten the apples to taste, and stir 
over the fire until the sugar is melted, but do not allow the mix- 
ture to boil. Add a teaspoonful of lemon juice and set aside until 
cold. Apple sauce made in this way is better in flavor and color 
than that made from the peeled fruit. The best part of the apple 
is that lying close to the skin, and it consequently loses much of 
its flavor in the peeling. 

If sealed up while hot this will keep through the winter and 
supply fresh apple sauce when the raw fruit is scarce and ex- 
pensive, 

Stewed evaporated peaches 

Wash the sliced peaches carefully and soak for six hours in 
cold water. Turn the fruit with the water in which it was soaked 
into a saucepan and bring to a gentle boil. Add a little sugar and 
stew until the peaches are tender. With a split spoon remove 



620 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the slices of fruit, add a cupful of granulated sugar to the liquor, 
and boil quickly to thick syrup. Pour this over the peaches. 

Stewed dried pears 

Wash and soak the evaporated fruit as directed in the preced- 
ing recipe, and put over the fire in the water in which it was 
soaked. The slices should be just covered by the water. Stew 
until very tender, then remove the fruit and set aside while you 
measure the juice. To a half-pint of the liquor add a half-pint 
of molasses and simmer for twenty-five minutes. Skim the 
syrup, return the pears to it, add a pinch of powdered ginger, 
boil up once, and remove from the fire. 

Gingered pears 

Peel and core and cut in very thin slices. For eight, pounds of 
sliced fruit put into a kettle the juice from five lemons, one cupful 
of water, seven pounds of sugar and half a pound of ginger-root 
scraped and cut into thin slices. 

Let the sugar dissolve before adding the fruit. Cut the peel 
of a lemon into long, thin slices and add to the fruit. Let it cook 
slowly for an hour, uncovered, and can while hot. 

Stewed rhubarb 

Carefully scrape not peel the stalks, cut into inch-lengths, 
and lay them in cold water for half an hour. Weigh the rhubarb, 
and to each pound of the fruit allow a half-pound of granulated 
sugar. Put the rhubarb, still wet, into an agate-lined saucepan, 
mix the sugar with it, and set it at one side of the range until the 
sugar melts. Bring slowly to a boil, and stew until the rhubarb 
is very tender. Eat cold, accompanied by plain cake, or thin 
bread and butter. 

You may seal up while hot in glass jars, wrap in paper to 
exclude the light, and keep all the year round. 



STEWED FRUIT, PRESERVES, ETCETERA 621 

Apple butter 

Boil cider down to two-thirds of its original quantity. Into 
this turn as many peeled and sliced apples as the liquid will cover 
and simmer, stirring often, until very tender. When the first 
supply of apples is tender, strain them out, add more and cook in 
the same fashion until all the cider is absorbed. Take from the 
fire, put all into a stone crock and set aside for twelve hours, 
then return to the fire and boil until you have a soft brown mass. 
Remove and pack in stone jars. 

Peach butter 

Peel and slice enough peaches to thicken three quarts of cider 
and boil steadily until the fruit is reduced to a pulp. While 
cooking, stir frequently. Remove from the fire, let it get cold, 
return to the fire and stew for an hour longer, or until brown and 
thick. Pack down in a stone crock. 

Plum butter 

To every pound of plums allow three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar. Wash the plums and put them into a preserving kettle, 
with the moisture still clinging to them. Cover, bring slowly to 
a boil, and cook until the fruit is broken to pieces and is very soft. 
Rub through a colander to remove stones and skins; return 
the juice and pulp to the fire, add the sugar and boil until the 
mixture is very thick. Put up in jars. 

Peach jam 

After you have peeled and stoned the fruit, weigh it, and to 
every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. 
Put the peaches in the kettle at the side of the range and bring 
very slowly to a boil in the juice that flows from them. Stir

ous juice and add the sugar. Boil for fifteen minutes, skimming 
often, then add the juice of a lemon, cook for a minute more, and 



522 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

turn into glasses or small jars. The surplus of liquor will make 
good jelly. 

Berry jam 

Pick over and wash the berries, and allow equal weight of fruit 
and sugar. Put the berries into a preserving kettle, mash them 
as they heat, and when considerable juice has been drawn out, 
add the sugar gradually. Let them boil up all over, and then 
either skim out the fruit, or turn all into a strainer. Set the juice 
on to boil again, and cook until it is thick or will "jelly;" put the 
fruit back and let it boil once, and seal up in small jars. 

If the fruit be very juicy, drain off half the syrup, strain out the 
seeds and cook until it jellies. Then, put up in glasses. Do this 
before adding the fruit for the last boil. A still better plan is to 
dip out superfluous juice before the sugar goes in. Add pound 
for pint and make jelly of it. 

Orange marmalade 

Slice two dozen unpeeled oranges, and remove the seeds. Mix 
with them two lemons. These, as well as the oranges, must be 
shredded very thin. Measure the juice and add enough water 
to make three quarts of liquid. Put all into a stone crock, cover, 
and set in a cool place all night. Turn into a preserving kettle 
and bring slowly to the boil. Simmer until the peel is very ten- 
der. Now stir in a pound of sugar for every pint of juice, and 
boil until the skin is clear in appearance. Remove from the fire, 
and when cool turn into jelly glasses. 

Grape marmalade 

Stem the grapes and measure them, allowing a cupful of sugar 
for each half-pint of fruit. Pulp the grapes, keeping the skins 
for further use. Extract the seeds by boiling the pulp until ten- 
der, then rubbing it through a fine colander. Put the pulp, juice 
and skins over the fire in a preserving kettle and add the sugar. 
Boil until very thick, pour into jars and seal.

Peach marmalade 

Peel, stone and weigh the peaches, and allow three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar for every pound of fruit. Put the fruit into a 
preserving kettle and bring gradually to a boil. Stew until ten- 
der and broken; drain off superfluous liquid, add the sugar and 
boil for ten minutes longer. Just before taking from the fire stir 
in one tablespoonful of lemon juice for every pound of peaches 
used. Remove at once from the fire, can and seal. 

Tutti-frutti 

Select your fruits strawberries, cherries, raspberries, black- 
berries, pineapple and shred them with a fork; also, bits of 
orange or mandarine from which the white skin has been re- 
moved ; put into wide-mouthed, self-sealing jars. To each jar 
allow four tablespoonfuls of white sugar and sprinkle with this 
each layer of fruit. When the jar is filled, pour in slowly white 
preserving brandy, letting it filter in slowly until every crevice 
is filled and there is room for not a drop more. Screw down the 
tops and set the jars in a dark cool place. The fruit should sea- 
son some weeks before it is used. 

Red raspberry jam 

Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 
Put the berries on alone and boil for half an hour, stirring hard 
and often. Dip out the superfluous juice, add the sugar and cook 
twenty minutes more. Put up in jars or glasses.

Lemon marmalade 

Weigh the lemons, and to every pound of them allow a pound 
and one-quarter of sugar. Grate the rind from half of the lemons, 
and peel the others. Chop the fruit, removing the seeds as you 
do so. Press all the juice that you can upon the sugar, add a 
little water to this, and put it over the fire. Stir until the sugar 
is dissolved, then boil for five minutes, skimming off the scum. 



624 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Stir in the chopped lemons and the grated rind, and boil for 
half an hour. Put up in jelly glasses. 

Preserved peaches 

Peel, stone and weigh firm white peaches, allowing to each 
pound of fruit a pound of white sugar. Arrange fruit and sugar 
in alternate layers in a broad preserving kettle, and set the kettle 
at the side of the stove where the contents will heat slowly. Stew 
for about half an hour after the preserves come to a boil, or until 
the peaches are tender when pierced by a fork. With a per- 
forated skimmer take the peaches from the syrup, and spread 
them on a platter while you boil the syrup until clear and thick, 
skimming often. Pack the fruit in jars, fill these to overflowing 
with the boiling liquid, and seal immediately. Stand the jars in 
a pan of hot water while filling them. 

Preserved citron rind 

Peel and cut the rind into pieces of uniform size, rejecting all 
the seeds. Lay the rind in salted water for two hours, then drain 
and lay in cold fresh water for six or seven hours, changing the 
water three times during that period. Drain, put the citron on to 
boil in a gallon of water, to which you have added two teaspoon- 
fuls of alum. Stew until tender, drain, and lay in cold water. 

Make a thick syrup of sugar and water, and when it boils cook 
the rind in it for fifteen minutes. Remove the rind, pack in jars, 
add to the syrup in the kettle enough lemon juice and ginger root 
to flavor it. 

When very thick, fill the jars with the boiling syrup, and seal. 

Preserved chestnuts 

Shell and blanch three dozen large chestnuts, stew slowly until 
tender, and drain. Make a syrup of a cupful, each, of sugar and 
of water, and boil until thick. Drop in the nuts, bring to a boil, 
add a few drops of lemon juice and vanilla, and remove from the 
fire.

Strawberries, preserved whole (No. 1) 

Cap the berries, preserving all the juice that flows from them. 
Weigh the fruit and allow to every pound of it one pound of 
granulated sugar. Put the sugar and juice into the preserving 
kettle and cook slowly until the sugar is entirely dissolved, then 
carefully lay in the berries. Simmer for seven minutes ; turn all 
into shallow porcelain-lined pans or stoneware dishes, and set 
in the hot sun, covering each dish with a pane of glass, or with 
mosquito netting. Leave in the hot sunshine every day until the 
syrup is thick. Put into preserve jars and keep in a dark, cool, 
dry place. 

Strawberries, preserved whole (No. 2) 

Sort the berries, reserving those of uniform size and perfect 
shape, and use the remainder for the juice. Mash them thor- 
oughly and let them drip through a flannel bag. Measure the 
strained juice and allow one pound of sugar to one pound of 
juice, put over the fire in a preserving kettle and let them boil 
twenty minutes or until the syrup begins to jelly. 

Weigh the reserved whole berries and allow an equal amount 
of sugar. Add both to the hot syrup in the kettle and let 
them simmer carefully. If it soon becomes firm, the mixture 
is cooked sufficiently. The berries should be cooked through, yet 
not long enough to shrivel. Fill jelly glasses with it while hot, 
and seal. 

Ripe tomato preserves 

Peel the tomatoes, and to every pound of them allow a pound of 
granulated sugar. Cover the tomatoes with the sugar and set 
aside over night. In the morning drain off the syrup and boil it, 
skimming frequently. Lay in the tomatoes and simmer for 
twenty minutes, then remove them and spread on platters in the 
sunshine while the syrup boils until thick. Add the juice of three 
lemons to seven pounds of sugar just before taking from the 
fire. Pack the tomatoes in jars, and fill these to overflowing with 
the boiling syrup. Seal immediately.

626 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Preserved rhubarb 

Cut the rhubarb into inch-lengths, wash and cook according to 
the recipe for preserved tomatoes, adding a very little water to the 
fruit and sugar. When thick, pour into jars and seal. 

Imitation East India sweetmeats 

Pare and slice two dozen Bartlett pears when ripe, but not mel- 
low. Cut into thin strips, about two inches long, and half an inch 
wide. Weigh the pears, and for four pounds of fruit allow three 
pounds of sugar, three lemons, two ounces of green ginger, and 
one-half cupful of water. 

The green ginger must be scraped thoroughly and cut into 
shreds. If this can not be procured, use the candied ginger root, 
also shredded. 

Cut the yellow part of the lemon rind into short shavings, boil 
until tender, strain, and cover with the lemon juice. 

Put the water into the preserving kettle, then a layer of pears, 
sugar, lemon and ginger, and repeat until all are used. Cover 
and set on the back of the stove until the sugar melts, and a syrup 
has formed, then boil gently until the pears are tender and clear. 
When tender, take up with a skimmer, pack into hot jars and boil 
the syrup down a little, then fill and seal as usual. 

Watermelon rind preserves 

Remove the outside rind of the melon and scrape out the soft 
inside. Cut the rind into strips. Line a kettle with vine-leaves, 
lay in the rind in alternate layers with more grape-leaves, sprinkle 
each layer lightly with powdered alum, pour in a very little cold 
water, cover the kettle closely, and steam the contents for three 
hours. Do not let the rind boil during this time. Drain the rind, 
and throw into cold water. Soak for four hours, draining and 
adding fresh, cold water every hour. 

Put into the preserving kettle two and a half pounds of gran- 
ulated sugar and a quart of water, and bring to a boil, skimming 
off the scum as it rises to the surface. When the scum no longer 



STEWED FRUIT, PRESERVES, ETCETERA 627 

rises drain the rind and drop it into the boiling syrup. When 
the rind is clear and very tender, but not broken, remove, and lay 
upon platters, while you add to the syrup a sliced lemon and a 
little sliced ginger root. Boil for ten minutes. Pack the rind 
carefully in jars ; fill these to overflowing with the boiling syrup 
and seal. 

Preserved pears 

Peel the pears, but do not remove the stems. Allow a pound 
of sugar to each pound of fruit, and put in alternate layers in the 
preserving kettle. Set at the side of the range where the contents 
will heat so slowly that the sugar will not scorch. Gently stew 
the pears until they are clear and tender, then lay them carefully 
on platters in the sun while you boil the syrup until thick and 
clear, skimming off any scum that arises. Put the pears into 
jars, fill these with the boiling syrup, and seal. 

Preserved plums 

Wipe the plums carefully, and prick each one with a fork to 
prevent bursting. Weigh the fruit, and to every pound of it allow 
a pound of sugar and a pint of water. Cook the sugar and water 
to a clear syrup, then lay in the plums and boil very gently for 
twenty minutes. Remove the fruit carefully, not to break it, and 
lay on dishes to cool. Boil the syrup until thick, pack the plums 
in glass jars, fill to overflowing with the scalding syrup, and seal 
immediately. 

Preserved ginger root 

Peel the green ginger roots and lay in cold water for fifteen 
minutes, then boil, changing the water twice, until very tender. 
Drain the ginger and weigh it before laying it in iced water. 
Allow a pound and a quarter of sugar to each pound of ginger. 
Wet each pound of sugar with a cup of water and put the sugar 
and water into the preserving kettle. Boil and skim until the 
scum ceases to rise, then remove the syrup from the fire and set 
aside until cold. Wipe each piece of ginger and lay it in the cold 
syrup. Stand for twenty-four hours, drain the ginger and reheat 



628 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

the syrup. Take from the fire again, and when blood-warm put 
in the ginger. Leave it for two days. Then take out the ginger 
and put the syrup over the fire. Boil up and remove and add the 
roots at once. Now set aside for a week before draining the gin- 
ger once more, boiling the syrup, dropping in the ginger and put- 
ting in jars. Do not use for a month. 

Preserved crabapples 

Select firm, sound crabapples, wash them and examine them for 
any sign of decay or spot. Weigh them, and to each pound of fruit 
allow a pound of sugar. Arrange fruit and sugar in a preserving 
kettle in alternate layers, beginning with the sugar. Let the con- 
tents of the kettle heat slowly at the side of the stove. When the 
fruit is tender it should not require over an hour after the fruit 
^has boiled to accomplish this take out the apples with a per- 
forated skimmer, and spread them on flat dishes, laying them so 
that they will not touch each other. Leave the syrup over the 
fire in a place where it will boil rapidly, skimming it frequently. 
At the end of fifteen minutes it should be thick and clear. Pack 
the fruit into wide-mouthed, self-sealing jars and pour the syrup 
over the apples. Close the jars while the contents are still hot. 

Preserved green grapes 

Cut each grape in half, remove the seeds and weigh the fruit. 
Allow a pound of granulated sugar to every pound of the fruit. 
Put all into a preserving kettle and bring very slowly to a boil. 
Cook until thick, then pour, boiling hot, into jars and seal. 

Preserved cherries 

Stone and stem tart cherries, saving all the juice. To every 
pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Put the sugar and juice 
in the preserving kettle over the fire, and when the sugar is en- 
tirely dissolved, add the cherries. Cook until the syrup is very 
thick ; put into glass jars and seal.

STEWED FRUIT, PRESERVES, ETCETERA 629 

Preserved pineapple 

After you have peeled the fruit and removed the "eyes," weigh 
it and allow a pound of sugar to every pound of the fruit. Slice 
the pineapple and put it and the sugar in the kettle in alternate 
layers. Pour in a cup of water to prevent burning, and bring 
slowly to a boil. Remove the pineapple, spread on platters to 
cool, and boil the syrup for fifteen minutes more. Pack the fruit 
in jars and fill these with the boiling liquid. Seal immediately. 

Brandied peaches 

Choose firm, white fruit for this purpose. Peel and weigh 
the peaches. To every four pounds of fruit allow three of sugar, 
a pint of brandy and a half-pint of water. Put the sugar and 
water in the preserving kettle, and, when they begin to boil, drop 
in the peaches. Let these boil gently for twenty minutes, then 
remove the fruit with a perforated spoon and pack in glass jars. 
Let the syrup cook ten minutes longer, add the brandy, and, just 
as the boiling point is reached, remove the kettle and fill the jars 
with the scalding liquid. Seal at once. 

Candied peaches 

Slice them thin and boil until clear in a syrup made with half 
their weight in sugar ; lay them on dishes in the sun and turn 
them until dry. Pack them in jars with powdered sugar over 
each layer. They are very nice if made with pure honey instead 
of sugar. 

Fox grape jelly 

Stem and wash the grapes, and put them into the preserving 
kettle, with the water still clinging to them. When the grapes 
are broken to pieces strain through a jelly-bag, measure the 
juice, and to each pound of this allow a pound and a half of 
sugar. Bring the juice to a boil, cook for fifteen minutes, add 
the sugar, which should be heated dry in the oven, and when 
this is dissolved fill glasses with the jelly. 



6 3 o MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Quince jelly 

Wash the quinces, but do not peel them. Cut in quarters and 
remove the cores. Put over the fire in porcelain kettle; add a 
very little water; cover closely and stew until the fruit is tender 
and broken. Strain and press through a jelly-bag, but do not 
squeeze the pulp. The juice must be allowed to drip through. 
Allow a pound of sugar to each pint of the juice. Return the juice 
to the fire and, as soon as it boils, pour in the sugar. Boil all hard 
until the juice begins to "jelly," skimming off the scum as it 
rises to the surface. Test the juice occasionally by pouring a 
spoonful upon a chilled plate. As soon as this quantity begins 
to jelly about the edge the kettle may be removed from the fire. 
Put at once into jelly-glasses. 

Grape jelly 

Put your grapes over the fire in a large double boiler, without 
water. Cover closely and cook until the fruit is broken to pieces. 
Rub through a colander, then squeeze through a flannel bag. 
Measure the juice, and to each pint allow a pound of sugar. Put 
the sugar in pans and set in the oven to heat, but not to melt. 
Stir it from time to time to prevent scorching. Return the juice 
to the fire in a porcelain-lined kettle, and bring to a boil. Cook 
for twenty minutes, add the heated sugar, boil up just once and 
pour the jelly into' glasses set in a pan of hot water. 

Currant jelly 

Wash the fruit, put it over the fire in an agate-lined kettle, and 
let it heat very, very slowly. When the fruit is hot and broken, 
remove from the fire and squeeze it through a jelly-bag. Meas- 
ure the juice and allow a pound of granulated sugar to each pint 
of the liquid. ' Return the juice to the fire and set the sugar in 
shallow pans in the oven to heat. When the juice has boiled 
twenty minutes skim it ; add the heated sugar, stir until this has 
dissolved, bring to the boiling point, and take from the fire. 
Fill your jelly-glasses while they stand in a pan of hot water. 



STEWED FRUIT, PRESERVES, ETCETERA 631 

Peach jelly 

Peel, stone and quarter a peck of peaches and put over the 
fire with a cupful of water. A dozen cracked peach pits added 
to the fruit will improve the flavor of the jelly. Cook steadily 
until the peaches are broken and soft ; strain and return the 
juice to the fire, with the strained juice of a lemon for every 
three pounds of fruit. Let it boil for twenty minutes, and add a 
pound of heated sugar for every pint of the juice. When it boils 
up once more, remove from the fire and fill the glasses. 

Crabapple jelly 

Cut juicy crabapples into quarters and put over the fire in a pre- 
serving kettle. Cover ; bring slowly to a boil and stew for sev- 
eral hours, or until broken all to pieces. Strain and press without 
squeezing, through a jelly-bag, and proceed as with peach jelly. 
The juice procured by squeezing what is left in the bag will make 
a good second-best jelly, well flavored but not clear. 



Cranberry jelly 

Wash a quart of cranberries, drain them and put them into a 
double boiler with the moisture still clinging to them. Cover 
and cook until broken to pieces. Turn the fruit into a jelly-bag 
and squeeze hard to extract all the juice. Measure this, and to a 
quart of it add four cups of granulated sugar. Return to the 
fire, boil up once, and turn into a mold wet with cold water. It 
should form into a firm jelly. 

Rhubarb jelly 

Cut the rhubarb into inch lengths, and to two quarts of this 
add a scant cup of water. Put into a porcelain-lined kettle, cover 
closely and simmer until very soft. Put a small quantity at a 
time into a jelly-bag and squeeze out all the juice. Measure this 
and return to the kettle and fire. Allow a pound of granulated 
sugar for each pint of juice. Heat the sugar in pans in the 



632 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

oven, taking care that it does not scorch or melt. Boil the juice 
for ten minutes, adding, as it cooks, a little lemon juice. At the 
end of twenty minutes add the hot sugar slowly, that it may not 
lump, and as soon as it is dissolved pour the jelly into glasses 
that have been dipped in hot water. When firm and cool, cover, 
first with tissue paper that has been dipped in brandy, then with 
tin covers, or with stiff paper securely fastened down. 

Apple jelly 

Quarter without peeling or coring them, tart, juicy apples. 
Drop the apples, as you cut them, into cold water. When all 
are done put the fruit, with the moisture upon it, in the preserv- 
ing kettle, and simmer very gently until the juice flows freely. 
Boil slowly until the apples are tender and broken. Turn, a 
little at a time, into a flannel jelly-bag, and allow the juice to drip 
through. If the bag is squeezed the jelly will be cloudy. Measure 
the juice and to each pint of it allow a pound of granulated sugar. 
Put the sugar in pans in the oven to heat. Return the juice to 
the fire and boil for twenty minutes ; skim it, pour into it the 
sugar and stir until this is dissolved, bring again to the boil, and 
remove the kettle from the fire. Set jelly glasses on a wet cloth 
to prevent their cracking, and fill at once. 



PICKLES 

IN the warm days when the thought of "sweets" brings no 
desire, but rather an aversion for them, it requires courage to put 
up preserves, and a certain amount of faith is necessary to make 
the housewife feel that she will ever want to eat the rich and 
cloying dainties. But with pickles it is another story. During 
the dog-days the thought of the biting acid is pleasing, and the 
recollection of pungent spices tempts the appetite. So the house- 
wife enters into the preparation of her pickles with zest that 
makes the task a pleasure. 

To be on the safe side one should, in making pickles, always 
use a porcelain or agate-lined preserving kettle, as the action of 
sharp acid upon a copper vessel may, unless great care be prac- 
ticed, produce a corroding poison. 

f> 

Wax for sealing jars and bottles 

Make a mixture of one-third resin and two-thirds beeswax. 
Heat together, mix well and put away until needed. When it is 
to be used lay a lump of it on top of the jar or bottle to be sealed, 
and press it down with a hojt shovel. This will melt it, and thus 
seal the cork. 

Cucumber pickles 

Choose only small cucumbers, as they make pretty, as well as 
tender, pickles. Lay one hundred and fifty small cucumbers in 
cold water for an hour. Remove and drain, then turn into a 
perfectly clean stone crock, and pour over them cold brine, so 
strong that an egg will float on the surface. After standing in 
this for three days the pickles may be removed, drained and dried 
on a clean towel. Wash the stone crock and return the cucum- 

633 



6 3 4 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

bers to it. Cover with pure water until the next day. Have 
ready on the range hot vinegar in which you have boiled two 
minced onions, twenty cloves, an ounce, each, of mustard and 
celery seed and a few blades of mace. Fill the jar with this 
boiling mixture, and add a cupful of sugar, stirring the cucum- 
bers up from the bottom. Cover tightly. In a week scald the 
vinegar again, and return to the jar. Let the pickles stand for 
six weeks before using. Six months is even better. 

Sliced cucumber pickles 

Slice three dozen large yellow cucumbers and boil them for 
half an hour in enough vinegar to cover them. Meanwhile, into 
a gallon of cold vinegar stir a tablespoonful, each, of onion juice, 
ground horseradish, cinnamon, black pepper, ginger, a half- 
teaspoonful of paprika, a tablespoonful of celery seed and a half- 
pound of sugar. Drain the boiled cucumbers, turn them into 
the spiced vinegar, put all into a kettle and simmer for two hours 
before putting into glass jars. 

Pickled onions 

Select the small white "button onions" for pickling. Lay 
them in a strong brine for four or five days. Drain and put into 
a fresh supply of brine boiling hot. Cook five minutes. Drain 
and lay in clear, cold water for a day. Drain once more, turn 
the onions into pint jars and pour scalding spiced vinegar upon 
them. Allow them to become tender before using. 

Pickled butternuts 

These should be picked when tender enough to be pierced with 
a needle. Cover with very strong brine and keep the nuts in 
this for three days; drain and recover with brine. At the end 
of three days drain again and leave in fresh cold water for six 
hours. Bring to a boil a gallon of vinegar in which you have 
stirred a cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls, each, of whole 
cloves and peppercorns, a tablespoonful of allspice and eight 



PICKLES 635 

blades of mace. Boil for ten minutes, pack the nuts in a crock 
and pour the scalding vinegar over them. At the end of three 
days drain off the vinegar, bring it to the boil, and pour it again 
over the nuts. Cover and set aside for six weeks before eating. 

Peter Piper's pickled peppers 

Cut a slit in the sides of large green peppers and extract the 
seeds. Lay in strong brine for three days and in cold water for 
one. Make a stuffing of eight tablespoonfuls of chopped cab- 
bage, four tablespoonfuls of English mustard seed, a teaspoonful 
of celery seed, two teaspoonfuls of chopped onion, a teaspoonful, 
each, of grated horseradish, whole peppercorns and ground mace, 
a half-teaspoonful of ground mustard and a heaping tablespoon- 
ful of brown sugar. Moisten to a paste with salad oil and stuff 
the peppers with it, closing the slit afterwards, and wrapping 
with soft string. Pack in a stone crock and fill the crock with 
scalding vinegar to which has been added a half-cup of brown 
sugar. Scald the vinegar a week later and return to the crock. 
Cover and let it stand six months before using. 

Stuffed mangoes or peppers 

Cut the tops from green peppers, and with a sharp knife re- 
move the seeds. Fill the peppers with salt and cover with cold 
water. Let them stand thus for two days, then drain ; leave in cold 
water for a day and fill with a stuffing made of two tablespoonfuls 
of minced cabbage, two tablespoonfuls of horseradish, grated, a 
teaspoonful of minced onion, a half-teaspoonful, each, of pow- 
dered mace, nutmeg and ginger, a teaspoonful, each, of celery 
seed, peppercorns and ground mustard, a teaspoonful of sugar 
and a tablespoonful of salad oil. When the peppers are stuffed 
tie on the tops with soft twine, pack in a crock and fill the crock 
with boiling vinegar. Repeat the scalding a week later. Cover, 
and let them stand for several months before using. 



636 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Pickled pepper hash 

Wash and dry five large green peppers and one red one, cut 
them open and remove all the seed, then chop the shells quite 
fine. Next, take a good-sized head of cabbage, remove all im- 
perfect leaves, cut it up and chop fine. Place both cabbage and 
peppers in a bowl and mix well together ; add two tablespoonfuls 
of brown mustard seed, three tablespoonfuls of salt, one of sugar 
and enough good cider vinegar to cover the whole; stir all well 
together and put into pickle bottles. This will be ready for use 
in two days, or it will keep for winter use. 

Pickled cherries 

Bring to the boiling point a pint and a half of vinegar, into 
which you have stirred half a cupful of brown sugar, a table- 
spoonful of whole cloves and a dozen blades of mace. Boil all 
together for five minutes, and set aside to cool. 

Have ready three quarts of firm, tart cherries (leaving the 
stones in them) and put them into glass jars. Strain the spices 
from the cold vinegar, and pour the vinegar over the fruit, filling 
the jars to the brim. Seal at once. 

Martinia pickles 

Gather when a needle will pierce the vegetables ; wash and 
pack down in a stone jar, then cover with cold brine strong 
enough to bear up an egg. Let the pickles stand in this for three 
days, stirring them up each day from the bottom. Drain and 
pour cold water over them, letting them stand for twenty-four 
hours in it. Drain this off, and pack the pickles in quart jars. 
Have ready scalding vinegar in which you have boiled for ten 
minutes a dozen whole cloves and peppercorns, four blades of 
mace and two teaspoonfuls of mustard seed. Fill the jars with 
the boiling vinegar, add a tablespoonful of sugar for each quart 
of vinegar, and screw on the covers. Let the pickles stand for 
six weeks before using. 



PICKLES 637 

Pickled string beans 

Remove the strings and boil the beans until tender in slightly 
salted boiling water ; put into glass jars, pour heated spiced vine- 
gar over them and seal up tightly, as you would canned beans. 

Green tomato pickle 

Slice a gallon of unpeeled green tomatoes and six large onions 
and mix them together. Stir into these a quart of vinegar, one 
cupful of brown sugar, a tablespoonful, each, of salt, pepper and 
mustard seed, and a half-tablespoonful, each, of ground allspice 
and cloves. Stew all until the tomatoes are very tender, then 
put into glass jars and seal. 

India relish (No. 1) 

One pint of young string beans, cut into inch lengths ; one pint 
of very small cucumbers (an inch long), each cut into three 
pieces ; three sliced cucumbers, one pint of button onions 
(peeled), four long red peppers, cut small; one cup of green 
nasturtium seed, one medium-sized cauliflower, cut into small 
clusters. 

Put all these ingredients into a stone crock in layers thickly 
strewn with salt, the uppermost layer being of salt. Cover with 
cold water, put a plate on top, weighted with a stone to keep the 
vegetables from floating, and leave in the cellar for three days. 

Drain off the brine, rinse with cold water by putting the veg- 
etables in a colander and holding it under the faucet; return to 
the crock, cover with cold fresh water and leave for twenty-four 
hours. 

Have ready three quarts of vinegar, one teaspoonful of Hun- 
garian sweet pepper (paprika), one teaspoonful of cloves, one 
teaspoonful of celery seed, two tablespoonfuls of curry powder, 
one teaspoonful of ground mustard, one teaspoonful of mace, 
one teaspoonful of grated horseradish, one and a half cupfuls of 
brown sugar. Let this mixture come to a boil, put in the drained 
vegetables, and simmer ten minutes after it begins to boil. Turn 



638 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

into a stone crock; cover closely and let all stand forty-eight 
hours. 

Drain off the vinegar and bring it to a boil; pour over the 
pickles and leave them for a day longer. Fill small glass jars 
with the relish, cork and seal. Keep in a dark closet. It will 
not be ready for use under three weeks. Six weeks are better. 

India relish (No. 2) 

Two pounds of citron melon or watermelon rind, two heads of 
cabbage, white and firm; six white onions, one large cupful of 
sugar, one heaping teaspoonful, each, of ground cinnamon, mace, 
paprika (Hungarian sweet pepper), mustard and powdered alum, 
one tablespoonful of curry powder, one quart of vinegar, two 
tablespoonfuls of celery seed, one tablespoonful of salt. 

Prepare the melon by cutting off the green rind and scraping 
away the softer inner coating, leaving less than an inch, firm and 
white, to be treated. Cut into thin strips, put into an agate-iron 
or porcelain-lined kettle, cover with cold water and sprinkle a 
tablespoonful of powdered alum over it. Cover closely and 
cook gently never fast for three hours. Drain well and cover 
with ice-water. Change the water twice in four hours, and then 
wipe the melon dry. 

Cut the cabbage into quarters, cook in boiling water slightly 
salted for fifteen minutes. Let it get perfectly cold. Parboil 
the onions and allow them also to get cold and stiff. 

Now chop cabbage, melons and onions separately, and very 
fine. Mix all together in a large crock, and pour over them the 
scalding hot vinegar, in which have been boiled for one minute 
the spices, sugar and celery seed. 

Leave the crock covered twenty-four hours, strain off the 
vinegar, bring it to a boil and pour again over the mixture in the 
crock. Repeat this for three days in succession, after which pack 
in small jars, cover closely and set away to ripen. It will be 
ready for use in six weeks, but improves by keeping. The re- 
sult will repay the housewife for the trouble of making. 



PICKLES 

Pickled watermelon rind 

Allow three pounds of brown sugar to each quart of vinegar. 
Bruise four ounces of stick cinnamon and two ounces of cloves ; 
tie in a mustard bag and boil five minutes with the vinegar. Pour 
this over the pared and sliced rind and let it remain twenty-four 
hours. Drain off the liquid, reheat and pour over the rind again, 
and let it stand for twenty-four hours. Then boil all together for 
a short time, and put into jars. 

Pickled nutmeg melons 

Young musk or nutmeg melons, four tablespoonfuls of Eng- 
lish mustard seed mixed with two tablespoonfuls of scraped 
horseradish, one teaspoonful of ground mace and nutmeg, two 
teaspoonfuls of chopped garlic, a little ginger, one dozen whole 
pepper corns ; one-half tablespoonful of ground mustard to a pint 
of the mixture allowing one tablespoonful of sugar to the same 
amount ; one tablespoonful best salad oil to each pint of the mix- 
ture ; one teaspoonful of celery seed. Cut a slit in the side of 
the melon and extract the seeds. If you can not get them out in 
this way cut a slender slit out, saving it to replace. Lay the 
mangoes in strong brine for three days. Drain off the brine and 
freshen in pure water for twenty-four hours. "Green" as you 
would cucumbers that is, have a kettle lined with green vine 
leaves, and lay the mangoes evenly within it, scattering pow- 
dered alum over the layers. A piece of alum as large as a 
pigeon's egg will be enough for a two-gallon kettleful. Fill with 
cold water ; cover with vine leaves, three deep ; put a close lid or 
inverted pan over all, and steam over a slow fire five or six hours, 
not allowing the water to boil. When the mangoes are a fine 
green remove the leaves and lay the melons in cold water until 
cold and firm. Fill with the stuffing; sew up the slit, or tie with 
pack thread. Pack in a deep stone jar and pour scalding vine- 
gar over them. Repeat this process three times more at inter- 
vals of two days ; then cover and set away in a cool, dry place. 
They will not be "ripe" under four months, but are very fine 
when they are. They will keep several years.

Pickled gherkins 

Put the "prickly cucumbers" by the layer in a stone crock, 
strewing each layer thickly with salt; then pour in enough cold 
water to cover them. Lay a heavy plate on the top of all to 
keep them from floating. Leave the pickles in brine for a fort- 
night, frequently stirring them up from the bottom. Pick all 
over, rejecting such as are soft, and lay the firm ones in a kettle 
lined with grape leaves, sprinkling a generous pinch of alum over 
each layer of gherkins. Cover with cold water and three thick- 
nesses of grape leaves over the surface of the water; put on a 
closely-fitting top and steam over a low fire for half a day. Drain 
the pickles and throw into cold water. Have ready a gallon of 
vinegar to which have been added eighteen allspice, three dozen 
cloves, three dozen black peppercorns, a dozen blades of mace, 
and a cup of sugar. Boil this vinegar for five minutes, then 
pack the cold gherkins in jars and fill the jars with the scalding 
vinegar. 

Ripe cucumber pickle 

Select rather small ripe cucumbers of uniform size. Steam 
them for three hours in a closely-covered preserving kettle, lin- 
ing this and covering the cucumbers with vine leaves if you can 
procure these. To a kettleful of material allow two teaspoonfuls 
of powdered alum, scattering it over each layer of the cucumbers. 
Of water there should be only just enough to cover the veg- 
etables. When the period of steaming is at an end drain off 
the water and throw the cucumbers into very cold water. Change 
this four times in four hours. 

Weigh the cucumbers and allow for every pound of these a 
pound of sugar and a half-cupful of cold water. Heat these two 
together gradually, and when they are hot lay in the cucumbers. 
Let them simmer very slowly until tender; take them out and 
spread upon dishes while you add to the syrup on the stove a 
pint of vinegar for every pound of the rind, and to every eight 
pounds of it a tablespoonful, each, of ground cloves, cinnamon 
and mace. 



PICKLES 641 

Chow-chow 

Prepare a mixture of string- beans, tiny cucumbers, small 
onions (peeled), a cauliflower (cut into clusters) and green to- 
matoes (sliced). Add to these four small, long, red peppers, 
and arrange the vegetables in a wide-mouthed jar, alternating 
each layer of these with one of salt. When all are in cover with 
cold water, laying 1 a board with a weight upon it on top of the 
contents of the jar to keep them from floating. Leave them 
thus for three days, drain the pickles, wash them with fresh 
water and let them lie in unsalted water for a day. Make a 
pickle vinegar by cooking together a gallon of vinegar, a tea- 
spoonful, each, of celery seed, white mustard seed, whole cloves, 
whole mace and whole black peppers, and one of ground horse- 
radish, two teaspoonfuls of tumeric, three tablespoonfuls of 
ground mustard, and a cupful and a half of brown sugar. Put 
over the fire in a preserving kettle, and, when it reaches a boil, 
drop in the pickles. Be careful that there are no decayed ones 
among them. After they have simmered five minutes take them 
out with a skimmer and put into a stone jar. Pour the vinegar 
over them, and let them stand for two days. Drain the vinegar 
off; put it back on the fire, add to it a tablespoonful of curry 
powder, and, when the vinegar is boiling, pour it over the pickles 
in the crock. When cold, put the pickles into small jars and 

seal. Ready for use in two or three weeks. 



Red cabbage pickle 

Quarter the cabbage and lay in a jar. Cover with salt and let 
it stand for twenty-four hours. Drain off the brine; wipe dry 
and cover with cold water for twelve hours. Bring two quarts 
of vinegar to the boil, spicing it, as you do so, with equal quan- 
tities of whole cloves, white peppers and blades of mace broken 
into tiny bits, a half cupful of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of 
celery seed. Pack the cabbage into a crock, and, after the vine- 
gar and spices have boiled together for ten minutes, cover the 
cabbage with the scalding vineear. Cover, and keep in a cool 
place. It must not be used under six weeks or two months.

SWEET PICKLES 

In putting up sweet pickles bear in mind that the fruit of 
which they are made must be very thoroughly cooked. If this 
precaution is not taken fermentation may possibly set in and 
the contents of your jars will be spoiled. Under the head of 
sweet pickles may be included such relishes as spiced grapes and 
currants, as well as the larger fruits. 

Pickled peaches 

Choose firm, freestone peaches for pickling. Morris whites 
are good for this purpose. Peel the peaches, dropping them 
into cold water as you do so, to preserve the color. Drain and 
weigh the fruit, allowing to every three pounds of it a pound and 
a half of sugar (granulated) and a cupful of vinegar. Stick a 
whole clove into each peach and put the fruit and sugar in lay- 
ers in a porcelain-lined preserving kettle. Put the vinegar on 
to boil in a separate saucepan with a cheese-cloth bag containing 
a tablespoonful, each, of mace, cinnamon and cloves. Boil this 
for five minutes, then remove the spice bag. Cook the sugar 
and peaches together for five minutes more, and add the vinegar. 
Boil until the fruit looks clear, and is tender, but not broken. 
Remove the fruit carefully with a skimmer and spread upon 
platters to cool while you boil the syrup for fifteen minutes 
longer, or until it is very thick. Pack the peaches in jars set in 
a pan of hot water ; fill with boiling syrup, and seal. 

TJnpeeled pickled peaches 

Rub the down from peaches of uniform size, using a coarse 
towel to do this. Prick each peach with a fork, weigh them, 
and put them into a preserving kettle with barely enough water 
to cover them. When the water is just short of the boil remove 
the peaches, and to the water in the kettle add sugar in the pro- 
portion of three pounds to every seven pounds of the fruit. Boil 
for fifteen minutes, skimming two or three times. For every seven 



PICKLES 643 

pounds of the fruit put in three pints of vinegar, one tablespoonful, 
each, of ground cinnamon, mace and allspice, and one teaspoon- 
ful, each, of cloves and celery seed, all well mixed and tied 
up in tiny bags made of thin muslin. Let all cook together 
for ten minutes after they have come to a boil ; put in the fruit 
an4 let it stew slowly until tender. Remove it from the syrup 
with a skimmer, spread it on plates to cool, and let the syrup 
boil until thick. Put the peaches into glass jars, pour in the 
syrup and seal. 

Sweet cucumber pickles 

Lay small cucumbers in brine for three days, then drain and 
lay in fresh water for a day. Line a kettle with grape leaves 
and arrange the cucumbers in it in -layers, scattering a pinch of 
alum over each layer. Cover with cold water and three layers of 
leaves; fit a lid on the kettle and steam the pickles (without let- 
ting them boil) over a slow fire for six hours. Drain the cu- 
cumbers, throw into cold water, and when they are firm pack in 
jars. Fill the jars with boiling vinegar that has been seasoned 
with a cupful of sugar to each quart, eight whole cloves, eight 
black peppers, six allspice and six blades of mace. Seal the jars 
at once. They will be fit for use in three months. 

Pickled plums 

Wipe firm plums with a damp cloth and prick each in several 
places to prevent bursting. Allow the same quantity of sugar, 
vinegar and spices to each pound of fruit as in recipe for pickled 
peaches. Put each kind of spice in a cheese-cloth bag by itself 
and the sugar, vinegar and spices all on the fire to boil at the 
same time. When the syrup is hot add the plums and stew until 
tender. Remove the plums to the heated jars, take the spice 
bags from the syrup, and pour this into the jars. 

Pickled crabapples (No. 1) 

Do not peel the apples, but wipe each one carefully. Weigh, 
and allow four and a half pounds of sugar to seven pounds of 



644 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

apples. Put the sugar and fruit in the kettle and add just enough 
water to cover the lower layer of fruit. Bring slowly to a boil, 
and cook until the apples are clear and tender, but not broken. 
When they can be pierced with a stiff straw they are done. Have 
ready boiling a pint of vinegar that has been spiced with cinna- 
mon, cloves and mace. (The cloves may be whole, the mace 
and cinnamon broken into bits, and all boiled in the vinegar for 
ten minutes.) Add the spiced vinegar to the boiling fruit five 
minutes before the apples are ready to take out. Remove the 
apples, spread on platters ; boil the syrup and vinegar until thick ; 
pack the apples in jars, and fill these to overflowing with the 
boiling liquid. Seal at once. 

Pickled crabapples (No. 2) 

Weigh and peel fourteen pounds of Siberian crabapples, and 
measure out a quart of vinegar and eight pounds of granulated 
sugar. Put the apples in a kettle with a pint of warm water 
and stew gently for ten minutes. Drain, remove the apples from 
the kettle, and then put them back in layers, strewing each layer 
with sugar. Bring to a boil. Have ready boiling the vinegar, 
into which has been stirred three tablespoonfuls of broken 
stick cinnamon and whole cloves, and a tablespoonful of ground 
mace. Pour this spiced vinegar over the apples and boil for 
five minutes. With a perforated skimmer remove the fruit, 
spread it on platters to cool, boil the syrup until thick, pack the 
apples in jars, and fill the jars with the boiling syrup. Seal im- 
mediately. 

Pickled beets 

Select nice red beets and boil until tender. Plunge each one 
separately into cold water, and with your hands give a little twist 
to strip off the skin. Cut lengthwise into strips. Place these, 
not too closely, in glass jars, leaving room that the liquor 
may surround each piece. To two quarts of vinegar add four 
pounds of brown sugar and one-half teaspoonful of alum, pow- 
dered. Let this boil. After skimming, add one teaspoonful, 



PICKLES 645 

each, of cloves, allspice, mustard, a few peppercorns all un- 
ground and tied in a bag. Boil again, adding a little cayenne 
and salt. Pour over the beets. Next day drain off the syrup, 
bring to a boil, pour over the beets again, then seal. This pickle 
will be of a rich red color and very delicious. 

Spiced cranberries 

These are good with roast duck or game. Wash a quart of 
cranberries and put them into a saucepan with a half cupful of 
cold water. Tie in a small cheese-cloth bag a dozen cloves, a 
dozen allspice, two sticks of cinnamon (broken) and several 
blades of mace. Put this bag into the cranberries and water, 
and stew all together until the fruit is broken to bits. Remove 
the spice bag, rub the berries through a colander, add two tea- 
cupfuls of brown sugar, stir over the fire until dissolved, and 
set away to get cold. 

Spiced grapes (No. 1) 

Stem, pulp and seed the grapes, then weigh them. To five 
pounds of fruit allow two and a half pounds of granulated sugar 
and a teacupful of vinegar. Put all over the fire with two 
ounces, each, of stick cinnamon, broken into bits, and whole 
cloves. Boil until very thick. This will take about half an 
hour. The mixture should be so thick that the juice will not 
run. When this point is reached put the fruit into jelly glasses 
set in a pan of hot water. Cover the tops of the glasses with 
rounds of tissue paper and fasten on metal covers. 

The wild or "fox" grape is good for spicing, when half-ripe. 
The grapes must always be firm, and not overripe. 

Spiced currants 
See preceding recipe. 

Spiced grapes (No. 2) 

Remove the skins from grapes, put the pulp over the fire and 
stew gently until it can be rubbed through a strainer that will 



646 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

not allow the seeds to pass. Weigh the pulp, and to every five 
pounds of this add a pint of cider vinegar, four pounds of brown 
sugar, three tablespoonfuls of ground cinnamon, and two of 
ground cloves. Stew all together until very thick. Pour into 
jelly glasses and cover with closely-fitting tops. 

Spiced rhubarb 

To two and a half pounds of rhubarb, washed and cut into 
inch bits, add a cupful of vinegar, two pounds of sugar and a 
tablespoonful, each, of cinnamon and cloves. Put all into a pre- 
serving kettle and boil steadily for half an hour. Put up in jelly 
glasses, as you would jelly. 

Olive oil pickles 

(Contributed) 

Peel and slice fifteen large cucumbers and six onions. Salt 
down heavily and let them stand all night. In the morning drain ; 
pour over them half a gallon of cider vinegar and let them stand 
four hours. Drain off the vinegar and heat with half a bottle of 
olive oil. Add some chopped red peppers and celery seed for sea- 
soning and when thoroughly heated pour over the cucumbers and 
onions, put into glass jars and seal at once. 

Sweet green tomato pickles 

(Contributed) 

Slice one peck of green tomatoes and two quarts 'of small white 
onions, and sprinkle over them a large cupful of salt. Let them 
stand over night in the brine. In the morning drain well and let 
them stand in cold water for a few minutes. Pour this water off 
and add enough vinegar to cover. Add two pounds of brown 
sugar, one-fourth of a pound of mustard seed and two table- 
spoonfuls each of allspice, whole cloves and stick cinnamon. 
Cook all together until the pickles are tender; put into jars and 
seal. 



PICKLES 647 

Pickled cauliflower 

(Contributed) 

Break the heads into small flowerlets, and boil ten or fifteen 
minutes in salt and water ; take from the fire and drain carefully. 
When cold place in a jar, and pour over it hot vinegar in which 
have been scalded whole cloves, pepper, allspice and white mus- 
tard. Have the spices tied in a bag, and remove when well 
scalded. For each quart of hot vinegar add two tablespoonfuls 
of French mustard and half a cupful of white sugar. Be sure to 
cover the pickle with vinegar and keep covered closely. 

Dill pickles 

(Contributed) 

Make a brine strong enough to bear an egg, then add half as 
much more water as you have brine. Wash the cucumbers in 
cold water, and into a stone jar put first a layer of cucumbers, 
then a layer of grape leaves and a layer of dill, using leaves and 
stems. Continue in this way until the jar is full. Pour the 
brine over all and cover, first with a cloth, then with a plate, and 
put a weight on top of the plate. The cloth must be taken off 
.and washed frequently as in making sauerkraut. 



CATSUPS, ETCETERA 

CATSUPS and spiced sauces are now so much used that the 
epicure feels they are an indispensable accompaniment to his 
roast or broiled meat, his bit of fish, or fowl, or dish of game. 
They may be prepared months beforehand and kept against the 
day of need. The same rule holds in the preparation of these 
relishes which we have quoted with regard to pickles. They 
must be cooked in a porcelain-lined vessel, or one of agate iron. 

Chili sauce (No. 1) 

Peel, and cut up together three dozen large tomatoes and a 
dozen onions. Chop into bits half a dozen green peppers and 
mix with the tomatoes and onions. Stir together a teacupful of 
brown sugar, five tablespoonfuls of salt, half a dozen teaspoonfuls, 
each, of powdered allspice, cloves and cinnamon, two teaspoonfuls 
of ground ginger, and a saltspoonful of paprika. Put these spices 
into three quarts of vinegar, add the vegetables, mix thoroughly, 
and cook steadily for two hours. When cold, bottle and seal. 

Chili sauce (No. 2) 

Peel and chop two dozen ripe tomatoes and six onions. Re- 
move the seeds from two red peppers and chop the peppers fine ; 
then stir them into the tomatoes and onions. Season all with 
a teacupful of granulated sugar, four tablespoonfuls of salt, three 
teaspoonfuls, each, of powdered allspice, cloves and cinnamon, 
and a teaspoonful of ground ginger. Pour over all two quarts 
of vinegar, and boil in a porcelain-lined kettle for two and a half 
hours. When cool, bottle and seal. 

648 



CATSUPS, ETCETERA 649 

Chutney 

Chop a white cabbage and eight onions. Pack in a crock with 
alternate layers of salt and let it stand twenty-four hours. Into 
a pint of vinegar stir a half-pound of brown sugar, a heaping 
teaspoonful, each, of tumeric, powdered alum, cinnamon, allspice, 
mace, black pepper, mustard and celery seed, and heat all to boil- 
ing. Pour this liquid over the cabbage and onions, and set aside 
for twenty-four hours longer. Now drain off the liquid, bring 
again to the boil, and pour it again over the pickle. Do this for 
three mornings ; put liquor and vegetables together in the pre- 
serving kettle, boil for five minutes ; set aside until cold, then 
pack in jars. 

Piccalilli 

Chop two fine large cabbages and a pint of onions, and mix. 
Pack down in a stone crock and stir in a handful of salt. Leave 
thus for twenty-four hours. Bring to a boil a quart of vinegar, 
into which have been stirred a pound of sugar and a tablespoonful, 
each, of the following ground spices mustard, pepper, mace, all- 
spice, celery seed, cinnamon and tumeric. Pour over the cabbage 
and onion, turn all into a preserving kettle and boil for ten min- 
utes. When cold, pack in pint jars. 

Grape catsup 

Wash tart grapes, remove the stems and put the fruit into a 
kettle, with just enough water to prevent scorching. Stir often 
with a wooden spoon and cook until tender. Rub, a little at a 
time, through a fine colander. Reject the seeds and skins, and 
measure the pulp. To each quart and a pint of this add a pound 
of brown sugar, a cupful of white vinegar, a heaping teaspoonful, 
each, of ground cinnamon, allspice, mace, salt and white pepper, 
and a half teaspoonful of ground cloves. Boil long and steadily 
until the catsup is reduced to less than half the original quantity, 
and very thick. When cold, bottle, cork tightly and cover the 
corks with sealing wax. 



650 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Currant catsup 

To four pounds of stemmed currants add two pounds of sugar, 
crush all together, and boil slowly until quite thick. Add one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, one-half pint of vinegar, one tea- 
spoonful, each, of powdered allspice, mace and cinnamon. Boil 
up and bottle at once. 

Mushroom catsup 

Break into quarters firm, fresh mushrooms. Put a layer of the 
broken mushrooms into an earthen vessel and sprinkle with salt ; 
then put in more mushrooms and more salt until all are used. 
Cover the vessel and set it on the cellar floor for three days, stir- 
ring the contents with a wooden spoon three times a day. At the 
end of this time, warm the mushrooms, mash them to a pulp, and 
strain through coarse netting, squeezing out all the juice. Boil 
this for ten minutes and measure. To every pint of the liquor 
allow a generous teaspoonful of whole peppers and allspice, a 
blade of mace, two slices of onion, a bay-leaf and a dash of 
paprika. Put liquor and spices over the fire, and boil until thick. 
Strain, cool and fill bottles with catsup. Seal tightly. 

Tomato catsup 

Slice a peck of unpeeled tomatoes with six white onions and 
boil together until so soft they can be rubbed through a colander. 
Now strain through a sieve and return to the fire with three bay- 
leaves, a tablespoonful, each, of powdered mace, pepper, cloves, 
sugar, salt, a half teaspoonful of paprika, and a tablespoonful of 
celery seed this last tied up in a small cheese-cloth bag. Boil 
for nearly six hours, stirring frequently. Remove the bag of 
celery seed, and pour in a pint of vinegar. Bring again to a boil, 
and remove from the fire. When cold, bottle and seal. 

Walnut catsup 

Select walnuts but half-grown and into which a needle enters 
easily. Prick each clear through three times, pack in layers, 



CATSUPS, ETCETERA 651 

strewing a handful of salt between the layers. Pour in cold water 
until the walnuts are covered, lay a heavy inverted saucer upon 
them to hold the walnuts under the brine, and keep them in it 
two weeks. Every day churn them with a wooden mallet to 
bruise and crack them into small bits. At the end of the fort- 
night turn off the brine, beat the nuts fine ; cover them with boil- 
ing vinegar and add the reserved brine. Measure liquid and 
crushed nuts, and allow for each quart a teaspoonful, each, of 
onion juice and grated horseradish ; two teaspoonfuls, each, of 
ground cloves and mace, and a tablespoonful, each, of ground 
ginger and black pepper. Boil steadily for two hours, run through 
a sieve, cool, bottle and seal. 

Pepper vinegar 

Break up half a dozen red peppers. Add three dozen black 
peppercorns and two tablespoonfuls of sugar to a quart of vine- 
gar. Scald vinegar and sugar, and pour over the peppers. Put 
in a jar, steep eight hours, strain and bottle. 

This is to be eaten with fish or raw oysters. 

Mixed mustard 

Into four tablespoonfuls of dry English mustard stir a table- 
spoonful of salad oil. When this is well rubbed in, add enough 
vinegar to make a smooth paste, a teaspoonful, each, of paprika, 
sugar and onion juice. 

Beat hard until light, and bottle. 



THE HOME BREW 

Tea (hot) 

First. Never buy poor, cheap tea. It is the dearest in the end, 
in every sense of* the word, being unwholesome, unpalatable and 
wasteful. One teaspoonful of good oolong, souchong, hyson 
or "bud" tea, will go farther than four of a mixture which, when 
brewed, tastes at the best, like boiled hay. 

Second. Have the kettle boiling, and freshly boiled. An hour's 
simmer after the boil has once been reached, makes the water 
stale and flat. 

Third. Draw off the tea within three minutes after the water 
is poured upon the dry leaves. After that, the boiling liquid ex- 
tracts tannic acid in pernicious quantities and strength. 

Fourth. Have the cups hot and fill with clear tea, adding sugar, 
or cream, or both afterwards, to suit the taste of each drinker. 

Cold tea 

Strain the liquid from the leaves within a few minutes after 
it is poured on. Set away until cold. Half-fill glasses with 
cracked ice ; add a slice of peeled lemon, a squeeze of lemon juice 
(if desired) and granulated sugar to taste. 

Breakfast coffee 

Allow a cupful of freshly ground coffee to a quart of boiling 
water. Put the coffee into the strainer and add the 
boiling water by degrees, until it is all in. 
Pour off into a heated pitcher, and return 
this to the strainer. Repeat until the 
beverage is of the requisite strength, and pour into heated cups. 

652 






BEVERAGES 



THE HOME BREW 653 

After-dinner coffee 

Make as directed in last recipe, allowing, however, three cupfuls 
of boiling water to one of freshly ground coffee, and run three 
times through the filter. 

Never pass cream with black coffee in after-dinner cups 
"demi-tasses," as the French, who taught us to drink it, call the 
dainty digestive agent. 

To ask for cream in such a case is a gastronomic and social 
solecism. 

Cafe au lait 

Make strong black coffee and, while hot, add to it one-third 
as much scalding milk. Cover and set in boiling water until 
needed. 

Iced coffee . 

Set aside cafe au laik until cold. Fill tumblers half-full of 
cracked ice ; sugar to taste, and pour in the coffee. 

Chocolate 

Heat two cupfuls of milk, and the same of water. Rub six table- 
spoonfuls of chocolate to a thin, smooth paste with cold water ; 
pour the water gradually upon it; put into a saucepan and bring 
it quickly to a boil. Cook thus five minutes, pour in the milk and 
boil ten minutes longer. Sweeten to the taste of each drinker, 
and lay a tablespoonful of whipped cream upon the top. 

If you would make the chocolate particularly good, heat a 
sillibub churn and beat the beverage hard for five minutes; set 
in a vessel of boiling water on the range to get smoking hot; 
pour out, sweeten, and cap with whipped cream. 

Cocoa 

It is made in the same way. 



654 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Cocoa nibs or "shells" 

Wet two ounces of cocoa shells with a little cold water, and 
stir them into a quart of boiling water. Boil steadily for an hour 
and a half; strain, stir in a quart of fresh milk, bring almost to 
the scalding point, and serve. Sweeten in the cups. 

Mint punch (very fine) 

Put into your punch-bowl a cupful of granulated sugar; add 
the juice of six lemons, and stir until the sugar melts. Put in 
three peeled lemons, sliced very thin, and leave in the ice until 
you are ready to use it. Add, then, a dozen sprays of green mint 
and a quart, at least, of pounded ice. Stir well for a minute, and 
pour from a height into it, two or three bottles of imported gin- 
ger ale. 

Tea punch 

Pour a quart of boiling water upon four teaspoonfuls of good 
tea. Cover, and leave it for five minutes. Strain off, and cool. 
Half-fill the punch-bowl with cracked ice, add a cupful of granu- 
lated sugar and the strained juice of four lemons. Pour the tea 
over these, and, as it goes to table, add a pint bottle of Apollinaris 
water. Strew a handful of mint sprays on the surface, and serve 
at once. 

Strawberry punch 

Pour two cupfuls of strained fresh strawberry juice upon a 
cupful (heaping) of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is 
dissolved. Add the juice of a lemon, and four cupfuls of cold 
water. Let it get very cold upon the ice; stir well and put into 
a punch-bowl. Just before serving, add a tablespoonful of 
maraschino, and half a cupful of fine, whole strawberries. 

Cherry wine 

Stem and wash ripe, sweet cherries, and with a wooden mallet 
crush to a pulp. Press out all the juice and to each quart of it, 



THE HOME BREW 655 

add a half-pound of granulated sugar and a cupful of water. 
Stir thoroughly, pour into a crock ; cover this closely with a thick- 
ness of cheese-cloth, and let the wine ferment for a month. When 
the fermentation has ceased rack off and bottle. 

Lemonade, or plain sherbet 

Roll, peel carefully and slice thin six lemons. Put into a pitcher 
or bowl with alternate layers of granulated sugar, two teaspoon- 
fuls for each lemon. Leave on the ice until you are ready to 
serve ; then add a quart of iced water and a great lump of ice. 

Lively lemonade 

Make as directed in preceding recipe, but pour in at the last, a 
quart of chilled Apollinaris, instead of the iced water. 

Raspberry vinegar 

Mash the berries and, when reduced to a pulp, add enough 
vinegar to cover them. Set close by the stove for twelve hours, 
stirring often. Strain and press ; add as many raspberries 
(mashed) to the vinegar as before; cover and leave in the kitchen 
or in the hot sun for six hours. Now strain, and measure the 
juice; add half as much water as you have juice, and stir into 
this five pounds of granulated sugar for every three pints of 
liquid. Bring slowly to a boil, let it boil up once, and strain. 
Bottle, cork and seal. 

* 
Blackberry vinegar 

Make this by the recipe for raspberry vinegar, only putting 
in five and a half pounds of sugar to every three pints of the juice 
and water mixed. 

Rhubarb wine 

Boil the rhubarb in a double boiler, adding no water after you 
have washed it and cut it into bits. Press out all the juice and 



656 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

measure this. Add as much water as you have juice, sweeten to 
taste, and add a cup of brandy to a gallon of the liquid. Bottle 
and seal. 

Grape juice 

Stem six quarts of grapes and put them over the fire with one 
quart of water ; bring slowly to a boil and strain. Return the juice 
to the fire, bring again to the boil, bottle and seal, while scalding- 
hot. 

Cherry bounce 

Beat to a pulp two pounds, each, of sweet and tart cherries, 
and mix together. The beating should be done with a heavy 
mallet that the stones may be crushed. Stir into the mashed 
fruit a pound and a quarter of granulated sugar; turn all into 
a stone crock, and stir in a quart of white whiskey. Leave thus 
for an hour; stir and pour into a demijohn. Cork and let it 
stand for a month, shaking hard each day; then let it alone for 
six weeks without shaking. Rack off, strain and bottle. 

Wild cherry bounce 

Bruise with a potato beetle five quarts of ripe, wild cherries, 
and stir into them four cupfuls of granulated sugar. Turn into 
a stone crock, cover, and set in the cellar for twenty-four hours. 
Now, add a quart and a cupful of brandy stirring it in well. 
Let the mixture alone for six weeks stirring every few days 
before straining off the liquor through double cheese cloth. Bot- 
tle and seal. When ready for use, fill liquor glasses with crushed 
ice and pour the crimson cordial into them. It is an excellent 
tonic, and also good for a cough. 

Homemade grape wine (No. 1) 

Put the grapes, stems and all, into an open cask, and mash them. 
Cover your cask with cheese-cloth to prevent anything from fall- 
ing in, as one crumb of bread will change the contents into vine- 
gar. When the grapes have fermented, pass through a fruit 



THE HOME BREW 657 

press ; turn the juice that has been extracted into a clean, close 
cask, and let it remain on its side for a month, when your wine 
will be ready to be bottled. By no means disturb the cask, or 
the wine will not be clear. Keep the wine in a dark, cool place, 
and lay the bottles containing it on their sides. When the grapes 
are fermenting, stir every day. 

Grape wine (No, 2) 

Crush out the juice of ripe grapes, after having picked them 
from the stems. A large quantity could be crushed in a cider 
press, but when only a few are to be used they can be mashed 
in a crock, or clean tub, with a potato beetle. Strain, then, 
through a bag, squeezing or pressing this so as to get all the juice 
possible. To each quart of the juice add half a pound of white 
sugar, and put away in a clean cask, or big jar to ferment. Cover 
the top, or the bung-hole, with a piece of netting. Let the juice 
and sugar ferment for three or four weeks, until it is clear and 
still. Pour it off the lees carefully, and bottle. 

Matzoon 

Take one and a half ounces of prepared matzoon, which you 
can get at drug stores, and one quart of fresh milk. Stir well 
and place in a pitcher at a temperature of from 70 to 90 degrees, 
for from nine to twelve hours, until it begins to thicken like 
junket; then beat it for ten minutes. Bottle in patent-stoppered 
bottles, and put on ice. Fresh matzoon may be made from that 
which you have prepared in this way. You have to buy but one 
bottle to start with. This quantity makes three bottles, not quite 
full, as it effervesces like koumiss. 

Strawberry wine 

Mash and strain six quarts of ripe strawberries. To every 
quart of juice add a quart of water and a pound of sugar. Stir 
well, and turn into a crock to ferment. When fermentation 
ceases, rack off. carefully, bottle and seal.

Dandelion wine 

Steep the dandelion flowers in boiling water for five minutes, 
and strain off the liquid, pressing the flowers hard. Sweeten to 
taste and add brandy in the proportion of a pint to every four 
gallons of liquid. Put in uncorked bottles and keep in a cool 
place until fermentation ceases. Draw off and rebottle. 

Dandelion cordial 

Four quarts of dandelion blossoms; four quarts of boiling 
water; four quarts of granulated sugar; three tablespoonfuls of 
compressed yeast ; two lemons grated fine ; one orange. 

Let the blossoms and water stand together until lukewarm; 
mix and add the sugar, orange, lemons and yeast ; strain, and 
put in a cold place for two days ; then strain again. Put into a 
keg and let it work, without tight corking, until as clear as water. 

Dandelion tea 

Pour boiling water over the dandelion blossoms; let them 
stand at the side of the fire to steep, but not boil, for five minutes ; 
then strain, pressing out all the juice. Sweeten to taste and 
drink very hot, or cold, in a glass filled with cracked ice. 

Ginger beer 

Boil six ounces of bruised ginger in six quarts of water for half 
an hour; then add five pounds of loaf sugar, a gill of lemon juice, 
a quarter-pound of honey, and seventeen quarts of cold water, 
and strain through a cloth. When it is cold put in an egg and 
two teaspoonfuls of essence of lemon. After standing three or 
four days it may be bottled. 

Ginger wine 

Four gallons of water and seven pounds of sugar. Boil half 
an hour, skimming well; let the liquor get cold. Then squeeze 
in the juice of two lemons. Have ready three pints of water in 



THE HOME BREW 659 

which the peel of two lemons and two ounces of white ginger 
root (pounded fine) have been boiled one hour and left to get 
cold. Mix with the syrup and add three pounds of halved 
Malaga raisins. Put all into a cask, shake well; close the cask 
and let it stand in the cellar for two months before racking it off 
and bottling it. A lump of unslaked lime as large as a pigeon's 
egg put into the cask will prevent souring. 

Mead 

Beat to a stiff froth the whites of three eggs, and mix with 
six gallons of water, sixteen quarts of strained honey, and the 
yellow rind of two lemons, peeled very thin. Boil all together 
during three-quarters of an hour, skimming it well ; put it into a 
tub and, when lukewarm, add three tablespoonfuls of the best 
fresh yeast. Cover, and leave it to ferment. When it has worked, 
transfer it to a barrel, with the lemon peel in the bottom. Let it 
stand six months, and bottle it. 

Strawberry punch. 

Mash two quarts of strawberries to a pulp, pour over them 
three quarts of water and the juice of two lemons. Stand in a 
cool place for four hours, strain, and stir into the liquid a pound 
and a half of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, 
strain again, and set in a cold place until wanted. Serve in 
tumblers of crushed ice. 

Sarsaparilla wine 

To one gallon of water add one pound of sarsaparilla leaves 
and stems, two pounds of sugar, one-quarter of a pound of raisins, 
and one lemon. As the fruit contains a natural ferment, it will 
undergo that process spontaneously, without the use of yeast. 
Let it stand five days, strain and bottle. If you have not the herb, 
omit the sugar, and use in its place a gallon of sarsaparilla syrup. 

(Purchase a "shaker" for compounding drinks in which 



66o MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

cracked ice forms an important factor. This shaker consists 
simply of a thick glass tumbler, over which is turned, upside- 
down, a larger cup of tin. This cup fits tightly over the glass, 
and the contents of the tumbler may be vigorously shaken until 
thoroughly mixed and foamy.) 

Iced orange juice 

Make a syrup of a cupful of sugar and three-quarters of a cup- 
ful of water boiled together for ten minutes, then set aside until 
cold. Mix a half-pint of orange juice and a gill of lemon juice, 
and sweeten abundantly with the cold syrup. In sweetening this 
beverage, remember that the ice is still to be added, and that this, 
in melting, will dilute the syrup and thus render the drink more 
acid. Fill tumblers to the brim with finely-cracked ice and pour 
the orange mixture upon it. This is a refreshing beverage. 

Milk shake 

Have ready some sugar syrup made according to the directions 
in the recipe for iced orange juice. Sweeten a half-pint of un- 
skimmed milk with the syrup ; flavor with a half teaspoonful of 
vanilla extract ; turn into the glass of your shaker, and add enough 
crushed ice to fill the glass to the brim. Shake long and hard be- 
fore pouring into a chilled tumbler. 

Koumiss 

Dissolve a third of a yeast-cake in a gill of warm milk and 
add two teaspoonfuls of granulated sugar. Have ready scalded 
a beer bottle with a patent fastener. If you have not this, use 
an ordinary bottle with a straight cork, and soak the cork for 
half an hour to swell it. Fill the bottle three-quarters full of 
fresh milk, heated until just blood- warm, and pour in the yeast- 
mixture. Shake hard for two minutes, and cork tightly. If you 
use an ordinary cork, cord or wire it down. Set the bottle in the 
warm kitchen for six hours, or until the contents begin to "work" 
and foam. Then set in the ice-chest until needed. As one yeast- 



THE HOME BREW 661 

cake will make three bottles of koumiss it is quite as easy to make 
that quantity at once as it is to prepare one bottle of the stimulat- 
ing and nourishing beverage. 

Blackberry cordial 

(Contributed) 

Warm and squeeze the berries; add to one pint of juice one 
pint of sugar, one-half ounce of powdered cinnamon, one-fourth 
ounce of mace, two teaspoonfuls of cloves. Boil all together 
for one-fourth of an hour ; strain the syrup, and to each pint add 
a glass of French brandy. Two or three doses of a tablespoonful 
or less will check any slight diarrhea. 

It will arrest dysentery if given in season, and is a pleasant 
and safe remedy. 

Raspberry cordial 

(Contributed) 

Sweeten the berries a little sweeter than for table use, and let 
them stand over night. In the morning lay in a hair sieve over a 
bowl ; let them remain until evening, so as to thoroughly drain ; 
then put the juice into a thick flannel bag; let it drain over night, 
being careful not to squeeze it, as it takes out the brightness and 
clearness. Do all this in a cool cellar or it may sour. To two 
pints of juice add one pint of French brandy and sweeten to taste. 

Toast water 

(Contributed) 

Toast a pint of bread crusts very brown ; pour cold water over 
them, let them stand for an hour, strain, and add cream and sugar 
to taste. The nourishment in the bread is easily absorbed when 
taken in the liquid form. 



662 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Slippery-elm tea 

(Contributed) 

Pour one cupful of boiling water over one teaspoonful of slip- 
pery-elm bark. When cold, strain, and add lemon juice and sugar 
to taste. This is very soothing in case of inflammation of the 
mucous membrane of the throat. 

Apple tea 
(Contributed) 

Roast two large sour apples and pour boiling water over them. 
When cold, pour off the water, strain, and sweeten to taste. 

Flaxseed tea 

(Contributed) 

Pour a pint of boiling water over an ounce of flaxseed and a 
little licorice-root, and let it stand where it will keep warm 
but not cook, for four hours. Strain through a piece of linen 
and make fresh every day. This is an excellent drink for a fever 
patient who has a cough. 

Flaxseed lemonade 

(Contributed) 

Over four tablespoonfuls of flaxseed pour one quart of boiling 
water and let it steep three hours. Strain, sweeten to taste, and 
add the juice of two lemons. If too thick, add more water. This 
is very soothing in colds. 

Egg-nogg 

(Contributed) 

Beat until very light, the yolk of one egg and a teaspoonful of 
sugar ; then add the white of the egg beaten to a stiff froth. Stir 
well together, pour into a glass, and add a teaspoonful of rum 
or brandy and as much milk as the glass will hold. It will give 
more nourishment if whipped cream is used instead of milk. 

Serve with grated nutmeg over the top. 




FORMAL BREAKFASTS AND LUNCHEONS 

THE social breakfast is becoming more and more of a function. 
Not the early morning breakfast, where the tempers of the eat- 
ers are not always under perfect control, but a later and more 
leisurely meal, to which guests are asked and where much the 
same laws of convention apply that are observed at a luncheon. 
In fact, the breakfast resembles a luncheon in most respects. 
Here, as at luncheon, the hardwood table is bare except 
for a handsome white square, and for doilies under the 
dishes and plates. The table is spread as for luncheon, the 
knives at the right, the edges turned towards the plate, the 
tumbler near the points of these, the spoon laid by the knife, 
the forks at the left, and beyond them the napkin, a piece of 
bread folded in it. At the left also stands the bread and butter 
plate. 

At the breakfast, however, there is a little less formality than 
at the luncheon, as there are also fewer and less elaborate courses. 
For, although the breakfast is usually served at twelve or half 
after only a little earlier than the ordinary mid-day meal it is 
regarded as less conventional in nearly every respect. 

Soup is not served at the formal breakfast any more than it 
would be at the family meal known by that name. The whole 
bill of fare is rather an amplification of the common breakfast 
than a variation from it. For that reason sweets are out of 
place to conclude it unless one wishes to introduce the English 
fashion of having a pot of marmalade and toast brought in to 
wind up the repast. 

Following this preamble are given a couple of menus that may 
serve as suggestions for the hostess who wishes to entertain at 
breakfast. It is an especially charming way of gathering one's 
friends about one in the warm days when heavy dinners are out 



664 



MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 



of the question and even late luncheons come at the hour when 
long sitting at meals is likely to be a weariness to the flesh. The 
summer breakfast may be served as early as eleven, or even as 
ten o'clock, while that of the late winter mornings may be held 
back until the noon hour : 



BREAKFAST MENU. I 



Tomato Omelet 



Grapefruit Salad 



Fresh Strawberries 

Broiled Chicken 
French Fried Potatoes 
Coffee in large cups 
Crackers 



French Rolls

Wafers 



BREAKFAST MENU. 

Iced Orange Juice 
Poached Eggs with Asparagus Tips 

Toast 

Green Peas English Muffins 

Coffee in large cups 

Cream Tomato Salad 

Brie or Roquefort Cheese 



Either of these menus may be adapted to any season. For 
example, if the breakfast be a spring or summer function, the 
strawberries may be served large strawberries, unhulled, to be 
dipped in sugar and eaten with the fingers, in the fashion that 
we have imported from England. If the berries are not in sea- 
son, however, the orange juice, made so cold as to be almost 
frappe, and served in small punch-glasses, may take their place. 
Either the berries or the orange juice should be on the table 
when the guests take their seats. Nothing else should be there 
then, except the regular furniture of the table, the glass or bowl 
of flowers in the center of the board, the piece of bread laid in the 
napkin and the butter ball or tiny print on the bread and butter 
plate. Hors d'oeuvres are out of place on the breakfast table, 



FORMAL BREAKFASTS AND LUNCHEONS 665 

unless you have radishes, which are decorative as well as ap- 
petizing. 

When the fruit has been eaten and has gone, the omelet may 
come in. This should appear whole. A Spanish omelet, with 
the rich yellow of the eggs, the red of the tomatoes and the 
green of the peppers, is too pretty a thing to be cut before the 
guests have had a chance to see it in all its beauty. It may be 
passed to each guest, or, better still, served by the host or hostess. 
In putting down a plate in front of any one the waitress should 
approach on the right side, just as, when she is passing a dish 
from which the guest is to serve himself, she should offer it on 
the left. In the case of the eggs, which are usually prepared in 
individual dishes, she should put a plate in front of the guest, 
standing on his right side as she does so. A small doily may be 
laid under each nappy. The toast may be either dry or buttered. 
The rolls should have been put in the oven long enough to be- 
come heated. 

For the third course of the meal rather large breakfast plates 
should be used, and these must be well heated. The chicken may 
be passed or carved on the table ; the chops should be passed. 
So should be the potatoes and peas. The hostess should serve 
the coffee at this point, having the equipage in front of her at 
the head of the table as she would at a family breakfast. The 
cream and sugar may be passed that each guest may add the 
"trimmings" to his coffee to suit himself. 

Either the grapefruit salad or the cream tomato salad is fea- 
sible at almost any time of year. With it are served the crackers 
and cheese on the same plate. This concludes the meal, un- 
less, as I have said, you wish to introduce the jam-pot and hot 
toast. But in most cases the guests will have had all they want 
by this time. 

At a breakfast the guests may be both men and women pro- 
vided one is able to find enough disengaged men to make a fair 
sprinkling. The breakfast should not be too large a gathering. 
Not less than four, not more than eight, is a good rule. 

At the luncheon, on the contrary, there may be any number 
that >he table can accommodate, and men are usually barred. 




666 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

The luncheon differs from the breakfast, too, in being a more 
formal function. Never at a luncheon could a guest rise from 
the table to wait on herself or some one else, as may be done at 
a breakfast, without risking the proprieties of the occasion. The 
table is set in the same way, but the linen 
should be, if possible, more elaborate. 
More embroidery, or richer lace, is per- 
missible on the cloth and center-piece, 
and color may be admitted more freely 
than at the breakfast. The flowers may 
be more and loftier, and at an elaborate 
luncheon a corsage bouquet for each 
guest, or at least a fine flower laid at each 
place is en regie. There may be place- 
cards also, and even favors, although these are by no means nec- 
essary, or in most cases, desirable. On the table, as well as the 
necessary plenishing, are small dishes of salted almonds, olives, 
radishes and bonbons. Wine may be served also, if one wishes it, 
and the glitter of the wine-glasses adds to the beauty of the table. 
If artificial light be preferred, there may be candles with colored 
shades that harmonize with the tint of the flowers, and the china 
should be as much in keeping with this chosen shade as possible. 
The luncheon, where only one color is prominent, is much more 
artistic than that where there is a confusion of hues. 

The accompanying luncheon menus may, like those given for 
the breakfast, serve as suggestions to the hostess on the lookout 
for a harmonious bill of fare :

Broiled Tomatoes 

Sweetbreads in Timbales 

Stuffed Lamb Chops and Mushrooms

Cafe Parfait 
Coffee 

The oyster cocktails or the fruit frappe should be on the table 
when the guests enter the room, the hostess leading the way with 
the guest of honor. No formal order is necessary in the en- 
trance of the rest of the company. After this first course the 
plates are changed in the usual fashion, taking from the right 
and replacing from the same side. The soup is served in bouillon 
cups. In neither luncheon is anything carved on the table, al- 
though occasionally, when a crown of lamb or whole chickens are 
served, or even fillet of beef, the hostess carves. But she should 
not attempt this unless she has a very poor carver in the kitchen 
or is remarkably deft at it herself. 

The table is not crumbed until after the salad course, and the 
work is always done with a napkin. The silver crumb-knife is 
altogether out of favor at present. At this stage, too, all the 
hors d'oeuvres are removed except the bonbons. These are often 
taken into the drawing-room after the luncheon for the guests 
to nibble while they chat for the prescribed time before taking 
their departure. Often the coffee, too, is served in the drawing- 
room. 

When wine is served at a ladies' luncheon it is usually some 
light wine, like Sauterne. Only one wine is necessary, although 
occasionally sherry is offered with the fish. If a liquor is served 
afterwards it is generally creme de menthe, poured into tiny 
glasses, first filled to the brim with crushed ice. It is said to be 
an excellent digestive. 



CONCERNING DINNER GIVING 

THE formal dinner is the most dignified function in the social 
calendar. Even a big luncheon is less stately, and, by compari- 
son, breakfasts, afternoon teas and evening parties are mere 
child's play. 

A dinner is the one meal with which liberties can not be taken. 
Yet there are rash souls who have attempted it and have even 
introduced at a dinner a course cooked in a chafing-dish. Such 
efforts may meet with the approval of a few youthful and frivo- 
lous souls, but they can only shock those who have a proper ap- 
preciation of the esthetics and ethics of gastronomy. 

All this applies to the formal dinner, to which guests are in- 
vited long in advance and where the staid succession of courses 
can be compared only to the progress of the units of the solar 
system. One can understand the dismay of these when a comet 
darts across their established orbits. Such is the effect pro- 
duced upon the graduate diner-out when variations are attempted 
in the solemn dinner of state. 

But there is another sort of a dinner The Little Dinner. It 
would never claim capitals on its own account, but they are be- 
stowed willingly by those who have fallen victims to its charms. 
At the little dinner the bill of company is considered as well as 
the bill of fare, and neither is chosen without deep thought. No 
chances are taken when there can be but four or six or eight to 
sit down to the table and where the courses are few enough to 
demand perfection in each. 

As a matter of course, this can not be managed without labor. 
The hostess must give close attention to every item on the menu. 
She must see that her table is all it should be in appearance and 
that there is no chance for any hitch in the proceedings. For 
while not so tremendous an affair as the many-coursed dinner, 
the little dinner still has a dignity all its own and with this one 
may not trifle. 

668 



CONCERNING DINNER GIVING 669 

The table should be spread with the finest and whitest of dam- 
ask over the "silence cloth" that is now indispensable in every 
well-regulated household. More and more the fancy is growing 
to have the center-pieces at a dinner, of pure white, with no touch 
of color. That may be supplied by the flowers, the china, the 
candle shades. The center-piece may be of linen, rich in em- 
broidery or heavy with lace, but all must be colorless. 

The flowers that are in the center of the table may be in a 
rather low receptacle, so as not to interfere with the conversation 
or glances of the guests seated opposite one another. The can- 
delabra, or dinner lamps, may stand at the corners of the table. 
Here and there may be little dishes in silver, cut glass or rare 
china, holding such hors d'oeuvres as salted nuts, radishes, olives 
and the like, and bonbons. Except for carafes of water there 
should be nothing else on the table besides the furniture of the 
individual covers. 

This is substantially the same as at a luncheon. The service 
plate, the knives on the right, the forks on the left, one for each 
course, the soup spoon laid with the knives, the water glass and 
wine glasses to the right, the napkin, a piece of bread folded 
in it, to the left. There is no butter used at a dinner and the 
bread and butter plate is therefore not needed. Always space 
enough should be allowed between the places to prevent crowding. 

Of the menus that follow two are for the little dinner. The 
third is for a rather more elaborate function, and the fourth may 
serve as an outline for one of the big dinners that every one has 
occasion to give once in a while.

For the little dinner as for the big the service is essentially the 
same. The appetizer, or the oysters with which the meal begins, 
should be on the table when the guests come into the room, the 
host leading the way with the guest of honor, the other guests 
following the couple, and the hostess bringing up the rear with 
the man to whom she wishes to show especial attention. 

The service plate, which is on the table under that containing 
the appetizer, is left there until after the soup has been eaten. 
In fact the guest should never be left without a plate in front of 
him. As soon as one that has been used is taken away the service 
plate should be restored, to be in turn taken away when the next 
plate from which he is to eat is put before him. 

The serving should all be done from the right, as has been 
directed in the chapter on luncheons, and the dishes passed on the 
left side. The soup may be served by the hostess at a little dinner, 
but always at the large dinner and often, too, at the smaller func- 
tion the plates are rilled by the servant in the pantry and placed 
before the guests. The entrees are passed. The roast is rarely 
carved on the table, even at a small dinner. The carving is done 
outside and the dish passed that each guest may serve himself. 
The day when the portion of each guest was put on his plate in 
the pantry and then put before him has unhappily passed. Un- 
happily, because it simplified matters for both the guest and the 
waitress. 

In changing the plates, more than one plate should never be 
taken at a time. It is a favorite trick with lazy or unskilled wait- 
resses to take off as much as can be carried. Sometimes they 
even go to the point of piling up all the various pieces that belong 
to one cover. This should not be permitted. Let there be an 
assumption of abundant service, even when this is lacking. 

The salad may be dressed on the table if preferred, and this is 



672 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

often done at the little dinner. In that case the small basin in 
which the dressing is to be mixed is put before the hostess, to- 
gether with the flasks of oil and vinegar, the salt and pepper and 
the fork with which the stirring is to be done. If chives or garlic 
is to be used, it should be in the bowl when this is brought in. 
The dressing may either be passed to each guest, or, better still, 
poured upon the salad in the dish, and this then passed. 

When it comes to the ices the method of procedure is changed 
a little. The individual ices may be placed on the plates from 
which they are to be eaten and these then put in front of the 
guests. 

The coffee may be served either at the table or in the drawing- 
room. The latter is always done, when the men are to be left 
behind to smoke. Under these circumstances there is usually 
cognac provided for them, while a liqueur of a milder type is 
offered to the women in the drawing-room. When all go out 
together they may either have the cordial maraschino, char- 
treuse, benedictine, or whatever it may be, before leaving the table 
or in the drawing-room. 

The service of wines is, in a way, a question by itself. It is 
not necessary to have more than one wine at a little dinner a 
good claret, or sauterne, or Rhine wine. Poor champagne is one 
of the most wretched of beverages, and it takes a rich man to sup- 
ply a really good article. If champagne is served, however, it 
should be ice cold, and may be poured after the fish. With the 
soup, sherry may be served, and claret with the entrees. If one 
has a number of wines, the white should be offered with the fish. 

But, as I have said, a number of wines is not necessary except 
for a very large or formal affair. In fact, the use of wines is 
entirely optional. If they are to be used at all, however, it should 
be in the correct fashion, white wines chilled, claret the tempera- 
ture of the room. The waitress should have a napkin pinned 
around the neck of the bottle and should stand on the right when 
she fills the glasses. She should watch these to see that they are 
not allowed to become empty. 

One caution to the hostess, a caution which may perhaps be 
unnecessary. Never attempt a dinner unless you are sure of your 



CONCERNING DINNER GIVING 673 

waitress. An inexperienced maid or man has it in her power to 
ruin the best cooked dinner. No dinner, no matter what its per- 
fections in other respects, can be satisfactory to the guests when 
the hostess is uneasy or annoyed about the conduct of the courses, 
the serving of the food. 

Temperatures at which wines should be served 

Claret should be served warm not warmer than eighty nor 
colder than sixty-five degrees. 

Bordeaux and burgundy should be served at a temperature of 
about seventy degrees. 

Chablis and other white wines should be served at forty-five 
degrees. 

Port at fifty-five degrees. 

Sauterne and other white claret, fifty degrees. 

Sherry is best at forty degrees. 

Madeira should be at sixty-five degrees. 

Champagne should have a temperature of thirty-four. To cool 
this it should be laid on the ice the dry, for a half or three-quar- 
ters of an hour; the sweet, several hours before using. Great 
care should be taken when putting the bottles on the ice not to 
shake them.

A green and white dinner 

IN the springtime you will have no difficulty in finding pale 
green leaves or delicate ferns with which to grace your table. 
Blossoms, such as the snow-drop, or the white wood-anemone, 
may be surrounded by fragile ferns and serve as a dainty floral 
piece for the middle of the table. Pear blossoms, with their 
bright green leaves, will form an attractive mass of flowers and

green silk, make use of them for this family dinner. If you do not 
possess such, your plain damask will be entirely in keeping. Your 
menu may be as follows :

A pink dinner 
(For Friday.) 

The month of June is the time of all the year for a pink dinner, 
for then the table may be decked with a profusion of pink roses 
that will delight the heart of the flower-lover. Set a huge bowl 
of these upon a white, or pink-and-white center-piece, dropping a 
bud or half-blown rose here and there upon the table-cloth. Have 
your lights softened by pink shades, and use as much white, or 
pink-and-white china as you have at your command.

exquisite and indescribable which field, forest and fen offer to

AN EVENING RECEPTION AND A 
CHAFING-DISH SUPPER 

THE old-fashioned evening party which was by no means a 
dancing party, nor even a card party has almost gone out of 
date. In this rushing day it seems next to impossible to pass 
an evening with one's friends with only conversation to make the 
time glide pleasantly. If there is no special amusement for the 
sake of which the company is assembled, there must be music or 
recitations, or something else to prevent the guests from boring 
one another. 

Still, once in a while even now there is an old-fashioned party. 
More often it takes the form of a reception to meet this or that 
distinguished person, or to celebrate some occasion. At such af- 
fairs, as at a wedding reception, it appears to be necessary to make 
up to the guests for the boredom they are presumably suffering 
by carrying out the principle "feed the brute." Accordingly, 
an elaborate collation is spread, and the men and women who have 
no other especially cheerful recollection of the evening, can at 
least testify that they have eaten and drunk well. 

For such events the supper is a pretty serious affair, and unless 
the hostess has well-trained servants she would better commit the 
matter into the hands of professionals. Still, if she be one who 
herself looks well to the ways of her household, and has her own 
ample corps of competent domestics, she may, perhaps, achieve 
the supper without turning to outside help. In this case the re- 
freshments will amount to much less in cost than if she relied 
upon professional caterers and waiters. 

676 



AN EVENING RECEPTION 677 

For the supper, which is to supply a large evening party, the 
bill of fare may, in a measure, resemble that already suggested 
for an extensive afternoon tea or reception. I give two menus, 
either of which is entirely suitable for an evening collation.

Coffee Iced Tea Punch 

The table is set in the dining-room, which is not opened until 
late in the evening. Everything that the house possesses in the 
way of handsome china, cut glass and silver may be called into 
requisition to beautify the occasion. There is usually a corps of 
waiters in attendance, although the gentlemen are also expected to 
do their duty in fetching and carrying, and in serving the ladies 
under their escort. There are times when they do nearly all the 
helping to the various dishes as well, but this custom grows less 
and less common. 

Usually the table has a center-piece of flowers and fruit, which 
is meant for beauty rather than for use. If fruit is to be passed 
it is either served in smaller dishes, or is taken with care from 
the foot of the central pyramid, where its loss will not interfere 
with the beauty of the table. Piles of plates, napkins, knives, 
forks and spoons are arranged on the main table, or on a side- 



678 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

board, and the dishes of salad, sandwiches, oysters, etc., are also on 
the principal table. 

Such a supper as this is appropriate for a dancing party, a 
wedding reception or any other form of evening gaiety. As a 
rule, there is also a bowl of punch in evidence in the hall near the 
drawing-room to allay the thirst of those who can not wait until 
the full supper is served. 

For smaller parties, like card parties, club reunions and the 
like, so elaborate a bill of fare is not necessary or desirable. For 
such functions as these the chafing-dish has supplied a felt want. 
With little trouble and comparatively small expense it is possible 
for the owner of a chafing-dish to set out a feast that will hardly 
fail to satisfy even a hungry college boy. 

A couple of bills of fare are herewith suggested for the use 
of the hostess whose experience with the chafing-dish has been 
too limited to take her beyond the realm of lobster a la Newburg 
and Welsh rarebit. The amateur generally fancies that these are 
the only combinations which lie within the range of the chafing- 
dish, and it comes to him as a surprise to be told that there are 
scores of toothsome dainties he can manage if he have the knack 
of the chafing-dish.

For a chafing-dish supper there should be no more guests than 
can group themselves comfortably about the dining-room table. 
As a rule, the dishes that are prepared are not of the variety that 
one can eat readily from a plate balanced on the knee, or in the 
hand. If the main table be not large enough to permit of all 
being seated about it, there may be smaller tables for the "over- 
flow." If one chafing-dish is too small to prepare as much as 
the appetites of the eaters crave, there may be one at each end of 
the table, and there should be an expert in charge of each. 

The table may be simply set either bare, or covered with a 
plain cloth. Flowers are out of place in the middle of it, as inter- 
fering with the free view, of the chafing-dish by the guests. For 
it makes no difference how often one has seen a dish cooked, there 
is always curiosity to see it done once more. About the chafing- 
dish are placed all the paraphernalia that attend upon that kind of 
cookery the condiments, the utensils, the spoons, forks, knives, 
measuring cups and the like. In chafing-dish cookery nothing 
can wait, and everything that by any chance can be needed must 
be there in advance. 

Let no one be so deluded by any amount of theoretical knowl- 
edge as to venture to make a maiden essay at chafing-dish cookery 
in the presence of a company of guests. There should always be 
a rehearsal beforehand. Nowhere else is stage fright more im- 
minent. Nowhere else has it more disastrous possibilities. 

If feasible there should be a servant at hand with a supply of 
hot dishes. All the other work of cooking and waiting may be 
performed by the hostess and her guests. The occasion should 



68o MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

be most informal. Persons who can not unbend readily should 
never go to chafing-dish parties. They will find themselves much 
out of place. To those who are fond of easy laughter and simple 
fun and a good deal of nonsense, and whose digestions this is 
chiefest of all are in good working order, there are few social 
relaxations that are pleasanter than a chafing-dish "affair."

FAMILIAR TALK 



COMMON SENSE AND "ETIQUETTE" 

A BRIGHT young fellow told the anecdote at a dinner party. I 
borrow it for the occasion. 

A self-making man in process of manufacture, dined with a 
more sophisticated friend at a city restaurant. When the soup 
was brought on, the S. M. M. prepared for business by laying a 
slice of bread on the cloth, and troweling it with butter. His 
host, who had been requested by the guest to "coach him a little 
in city ways," said mildly : 

"That isn't quite the thing, old man ! Break off a bit of bread 
and butter it, as you wish to eat it." 

"All right !" said the other, "I want to know about the latest 
touches." 

His next solecism was to fish up a bit of meat from the dish 
with his own fork, and his friend again set him right. Blunder 
No, 3 was putting his knife into his mouth; No. 4 was cutting 
up his salad ; No. 5, sandwiching cheese between two crackers 
and crunching it noisily ; No. 6 was creaming black coffee. 

"I say !" he broke in at this point, still good-humoredly, "what 
do you call all these fool rules you've been telling me? I 
s'pose a fellow ought to know something about them. But they 
come hard, at first." 

"I suppose," said the mentor, somewhat nonplussed, "that they 
may all be classed under the head of table etiquette." 

"Et-er-ket !" slowly and thoughtfully. "Well, I say, old fellow 
there ain't many that has got on to it yet is there ?" 

Resisting the temptation to dwell upon the many who never 
"get on to it," let us look for the commonsensible basis of certain 
minor social usages which are accepted as matters of course by 

68 1 



682 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

well-bred people, and contemned by the boorish and ignorant as 
"fool rules" that hamper personal liberty. 

Few conventionalities are arbitrary. Most of them are reasona- 
ble, many so just as to be binding upon the lovers of decency and 
order, not to say healthfullness. 

To carry food* to the mouth with the knife-blade is awkward, 
and if the knife have an edge, unsafe. If I were at the point of 
death, I should laugh and blush together at the memory of the 
commotion excited in a London family hotel last year by the 
exclamation of an American tourist who jumped up from the 
dinner-table and clapped his napkin to his mouth with "Waiter ! 
Never put a sharp knife at my place again ! I have cut my mouth 
badly ! It might have done serious harm !" 

The rule against touching fish with a knife dates back to a 
time when steel knives were in general use. Steel imparts an 
unpleasant taste to the more delicate kinds of cooked fish. Hence, 
the custom of leaving the knife beside the plate, and using the 
fork alone during the fish course. 

A like rule obtains with regard to salads. To cut is to bruise 
the tender esculents, and to injure the flavor. The leaves of let- 
tuce should be torn apart in preparing it for the table, with as 
little handling as possible, and eaten as soon as the salad is 
dressed. Other salads as beets, celery, etc., are cut up and ready 
for eating when sent to table. To use the knife upon them is a 
reflection upon cook and host. 

To butter a whole slice of bread at once especially when it 
is laid on the table in order to do it is slovenly, wasteful and 
awkward. If eaten as a whole, one must gnaw or nibble at it, 
and to cut it after it is buttered is neither neat nor convenient. 

The fashion of finger-bowl and napkin would seem to commend 
itself to everybody as eminently cleanly and comforta- 
ble. Yet there are still well-to-do people who sneer at 
the idea of "doing one's washing at the table." 

The by-law obeyed by the transient guest who lays his napkin 
carelessly on the table when the meal is over, instead of folding 
it, is easily understood. To fold it implies that it may be used 
again before it is washed. 




FAMILIAR TALK 683 

"Mr. Blank has no napkin, James!" said a hostess of the 
nouveau riche order, to her butler. 

"I beg pardon!" interposed the guest, lifting a corner of the 
napkin from his knee that she might see her mistake. "I have 
one." 

"Ah !" with an apologetic smile. "I saw that you did not have 
it on!" 

To tuck the napkin into the collar, or pin it around the neck 
before attacking one's food may be a wise precaution if one has 
never learned to convey it to the mouth without dropping or drip- 
ping it. Gentlemen are supposed to have put away bibs with other 
childish things. The suggestion of putting a napkin "on" is not 
agreeable. The place for the useful bit of fine linen is on the knee 
or lap, out of sight of fellow-eaters. 

Black coffee in after-dinner coffee cups is a digestive agent a 
gastronomic expletive not a beverage. To cream it is to pervert 
its meaning, and to defeat the end for which it is served. It is 
well known that the addition of cream or milk to coffee causes a 
chemical change in both ingredients. To some stomachs creamed 
coffee, or cafe au lait, is poisonous. Clear black coffee is a tonic, 
and agrees with everybody. 

To toss off a glass of water as soon as one sits down to a meal 
is an infringement of table-etiquette. Those who recognize the 
fact do not always bethink themselves of the reason lying back 
of the "fool rule." To fill the stomach with iced water is to check 
the process of digestion temporarily. To add to the water a 
plateful of hot soup is to disgust the diaphragm by a load of luke- 
warm liquid, very like the dish-water in the pan of an untidy 
scullion. 

I might go on, ad infinilum, multiplying instances of what are 
sneered at by the untaught and unthinking slaves of their own 
prejudices as foolish and useless limitations to a man's right to 
eat, drink and make merry after his own fashion. Which I may 
observe is usually the fashion of the beasts that perish. 

Enough has been said to give credit to the sagacity and hu- 
manity of those who set the pace for our better classes better in 
so far as they conserve the best interests of the race, ^and lend 
countenance to all that is kindly, wholesome and comely. 



"CANNED GOODS" 

CANNED FRUITS 

I CLIP from a family paper an item linking ancient and modern 
housewifery : 

"It is a singular fact that we are indebted to Pompeii for the 
great industry of canned fruits. Years ago, when the excavations 
were just beginning, a party of Americans found, in what had 
been the pantry of a house, many jars of preserved figs. One 
was opened, and its contents were fresh and good. Investigation 
showed that the figs had been put into the jar in a heated state ; 
an aperture had been left for the steam to escape and then sealed 
with wax. The hint was taken, and the next year fruit-canning 
was introduced in the United States." 

There is no reason why canned fruits which have kept one year 
should not keep for a hundred years in a dark place. The light 
acts chemically upon the contents. If not properly canned they 
will spoil within a few weeks. Hence, no preliminary which will 
make this, the heaviest work of the summer, thorough, yet as 
easy as possible, should be neglected. 

Granite or porcelain lined kettles, with bales and lips for con- 
venience in pouring, and which are free from all blemish or break 
in the glazing, are almost essential for this work. They should 
be broad, that considerable surface may be exposed to the heat, 
and deep enough to prevent boiling over. 

A small, sharp-pointed knife for paring; also, an old silver- 
plated knife ground to a fine edge, will be found convenient for 
articles which a steel knife might discolor. 

Wooden spoons, a wire spoon, large and small silver spoons, 
scales, a hair sieve, an agate-iron colander, a wooden masher, a 

684 



CANNED GOODS 685 

fruit press, coarse and fine cheese-cloth, and fine cotton and wool 
flannel, are almost essential to the sort of work I have indicated. 

Quart and pint glass jars, with large tops, are the best for gen- 
eral use. See that the glass covers are free from nicks, the spring, 
or clamp, in perfect order, and that the rubbers are new and free 
from cracks. A few jars of the two-quart size will not be amiss 
if you plan to can large fruit whole. 

Use the best granulated sugar, and "agate-nickel-steel" or 
porcelain-lined ware as kettles. 



Canned tart apples 

Peel and quarter firm apples, throwing them into cold water as 
you do so. Weigh the fruit and allow two pounds of granulated 
sugar to eight pounds of apples. Put the apples into a preserv- 
ing-kettle, pour over them barely enough cold water to cover 
them, and let them cook gently until tender. While these are 
cooking, make a syrup by mixing the sugar with water (allowing 
a cupful of water to each pound of sugar) and bringing to a boil. 
Cook for four minutes, then lift the tender apples from the water, 
lay them gently in the syrup, simmer for a minute, and while 
very hot, put into self-sealing jars. These apples make excellent 
pies. 

Canned sweet apples 

Core campfield, or "pound sweets," or other sweet apples, drop- 
ping them in water as you do this. When all are ready, pack in 
heated glass cans. Have at hand a syrup made by mixing a cup- 
ful of sugar with a cupful of water, allowing this quantity to 
every two-quart can. Boil hard fifteen minutes, adding the juice 
of half a lemon for every two cups of sugar. Roll the cans in hot 
water before putting in the apples* fill at once with the boiling 
syrup, and set in a bake-pan of hot water, then in a good oven. 
When the syrup is again at the boiling point, seal immediately. 

Larger apples may be put up in this way by coring and quarter- 
ing. They are delicious eaten with cream. 



686 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Canned apple sauce 

Cut up tart apples without paring, leaving out the cores. Put 
over the fire with a cupful of water in the bottom of a large kettle 
to prevent burning, and cook soft. Rub through a colander to 
get rid of the peel, reheat to the boiling point, add two tablespoon- 1 
fuls of sugar to each pint of the sauce, stirring it over the fire ; 
fill the jars to overflowing and seal while boiling-hot. It will 
keep well for years, and be most acceptable when apples are scarce. 

Canned seckel pears 

Peel the pears, dropping them into cold water as you do so, to 
prevent their turning dark. To every two quarts of fruit allow 
a quart of water and a half-pound of granulated sugar. Bring 
the sugar and water to a boil, and when bubbling lay the pears 
in this syrup. Boil until the fruit can be pierced with a straw. 
Pack the hot fruit in air-tight cans, fill to overflowing with the 
boiling syrup and seal. 

Canned pears, impeded 

Wash and core large, firm pears in cold water, put into a kettle, 
cover with cold water, and simmer gently until tender, but not 
until they begin to break or crumble. Remove from the fire and 
spread in pans to cool. Make a syrup of a pound of sugar to four 
pounds of the fruit and a quart of water, and boil for five minutes, 
then add the juice of two lemons. Pack the pears carefully into 
jars, fill the jars to overflowing with the scalding liquid, and seal. 

Canned peaches 

Peel, stone and halve the peaches, dropping them into cold 
water as you do so. Allow a cupful of sugar to four quarts of 
fruit. Pour a cupful of water into the bottom of a preserving- 
kettle, put in a layer of peaches, sprinkle with sugar, add more 
peaches and more sugar until all the fruit is used. Bring slowly 



CANNED GOODS 687 

to a boil, and do not cook for more than fifteen minutes. Can 
and seal immediately, boiling-hot. 

Canned plums 

To six quarts of plums allow a cupful, each, of sugar and water. 
Wipe the plums and prick each with a needle. Put the sugar and 
water into a porcelain kettle, and lay the plums in this. Bring 
slowly to a boil and cook for five minutes. Put the plums into 
jars and fill these to overflowing with the boiling liquid. Seal at 
once. 

Canned green gages 

Prick each plum in two places with a darning-needle. To every 
pound of fruit allow a half-pound of sugar and a half cupful of 
water. Bring the sugar and water to a boil, lay the plums in 
this, and simmer for five minutes. Pack the plums in jars, fill 
with boiling syrup and seal. 

Canned cherries 

To every pound of washed and stemmed Morello cherries allow 
a half-pound of sugar. Put the sugar over the fire with enough 
water to dissolve it, and boil to a thin syrup. As the scum rises 
to the top of the liquid, remove it. Turn the cherries into the 
boiling liquid, and cook for five minutes. Remove the cherries 
from the kettle, pack into pint jars, fill with the boiling syrup, 
and fit on air-tight lids. 

These cherries may be used in filling baked pastry-shells, and 
thus form delicious tarts. 

Canned rhubarb 

Rhubarb may be canned the same as cherries, cut in inch 
lengths without peeling; allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Scald quickly, fill jars and seal. 



688 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 



Canned raspberries (1) 

To each quart of raspberries allow a half teacupful of water 
and a half-pound of granulated sugar. Cover the berries wjth the 
sugar, and let them stand for an hour. Put berries and sugar 
over the fire with the water, bring to a hard boil, then can. 



Canned blackberries 

Measure your berries and allow a heaping tablespoonful of 
sugar to each quart of fruit. Put the berries on alone, and bring 
slowly to the boiling point, and if there is any surplus juice, dip 
this out before adding the sugar. Boil the berries and sugar 
for fifteen minutes and can quickly, filling each can to overflow- 
ing. 

Canned strawberries 

Weigh the berries, and to every pound of fruit allow a quarter- 
pound of granulated sugar. Put sugar and berries in an earthen 
jar, and stand for an hour. Turn into a preserving-kettle, add a 
pinch of alum, and simmer slowly for fifteen minutes. Dip out 
the superfluous juice. Fill the jars to overflowing with the fruit, 
and seal immediately. 

Canned raspberries (2) 
Follow the last recipe in every particular. 

Canned gooseberries 

Make a syrup with one pound of white sugar to each pound 
of fruit, stew them till quite clear and until the syrup becomes 
thick, but do not let them be mashed. Do not cover the pan while 
stewing. 

Canned quinces 

Pare, and cut into quarters, dropping into cold water as you 
do this, to preserve the color. Weigh the fruit and allow three- 



CANNED GOODS 689 

fourths as much sugar. Cook the quinces gently in boiling water 
until soft, skim out the fruit, add the sugar to this water, skim well 
and boil till clear. Return the quinces to the syrup till heated 
through, drain and put into jars. Boil the syrup ten minutes 
longer, strain it into the jars, fill to overflowing, and seal as usual. 



CANNED VEGETABLES 

Some housewives hold that when canned vegetables may be 
bought for the low price at which they now stand, it is mistaken 
economy to attempt to "put up" such articles at home. But there 
are two sides to this question. In the first place there are small 
country places where it is next to impossible to buy many kinds 
of canned vegetables, and the dwellers in such localities must, of 
necessity, do their own canning. A still greater consideration is 
the fact that vegetables preserved in tin cans are not as delicate 
in flavor as those put up in glass. Imported peas, beans, etc., 
may be purchased in glass jars, but these are so expensive as to 
be beyond the reach of the economical housewife. Let her then, 
supply herself with a number of wide-mouthed glass jars with 
properly fitting rubber rings and tops, and she may snap her fin- 
gers at importers and domestic grocers. 

Tomatoes, canned whole (No. 1) 

This is a delicate process, but the result amply repays one for 
her pains. 

Stew small tomatoes tender and squeeze from them every drop 
of juice. Strain this juice through a flannel jelly-bag, without 
squeezing the bag. Season, and set aside until needed. With a 
thin-bladed, sharp knife remove the cores from the center of large, 
firm, smooth tomatoes. Lay the tomatoes, side by side, in a deep 
bake-pan, and pour cold water around them until it covers them 
entirely. Set in a moderate oven where the contents will heat 
gradually, and cover closely. When the water begins to boil, the 
pan may be removed, and the tomatoes carefully taken up. Put 
44 



690 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

them very gently into large-mouthed quart jars. Bring the 
strained juice to a boil, skim well, fill the jars to overflowing with 
this, and screw on the tops. 

These tomatoes may be stuffed and baked in the winter, and 
will be found to be as fine in flavor as the fresh vegetables. Tiny 
"egg tomatoes" may be canned in the same way, without removing 
the cores, and form a dainty garnish for such dishes as beef a la 
jardiniere. 

Tomatoes, canned whole (No. 2) 

Select firm, ripe tomatoes ; immerse in boiling water for a few 
minutes and slip off the skins. Have ready a large kettle of boiling 
water. Into this put enough tomatoes to fill just one jar. It 
takes about six tomatoes to fill a jar. Cover and allow them to 
remain eight minutes. Pack into a hot jar, fill up with boiling 
water and seal at once. They keep well and taste almost like 
fresh ones. 

Canned stewed tomatoes 

Scald the tomatoes and remove the skins, laying the vegeta- 
bles in a colander, that the juice may drip away. Put into a por- 
celain-lined kettle and bring to a boil. Stew for fifteen minutes, 
pour off any superfluous liquor, season with salt, and pour the 
tomatoes, boiling-hot, into the cans. Seal immediately. 

Canned corn 

One of the most difficult vegetables to can is sweet corn, and I 
would advise the housewife not to run the risk of throwing time 
and labor away upon the attempt to preserve this vegetable. I, 
myself, have observed the utmost care in canning corn, only to 
find, after the lapse of a few weeks, that the vegetable had begun 
to ferment and was uneatable. It may, however, be safely canned 
with tomatoes, and thus prepared, makes a delicious scallop and 
a pleasant addition to vegetable soups and to stews. 



CANNED GOODS 691 

Canned corn and tomatoes 

Boil two dozen ears of ripe corn until the kernels are tender. 
Remove from the fire and, while still hot, cut the corn from the 
cob with a short knife. Peel two dozen ripe tomatoes, and chop 
into small bits. Mix the corn and tomatoes together, salt to taste, 
and put over the fire in a porcelain-lined kettle. Bring to a hard 
boil, cook for a minute and pour at once into quart jars. Seal 
immediately. 

Potted corn 

Boil the ears of corn for ten minutes after the boil begins. 
Remove from the water and cut all the kernels from the cobs. 
Put a layer of the corn in the bottom of a jar, and cover thickly 
with a layer of salt. Put in another stratum of corn, then more 
salt, until the jar is full having the top layer of salt. Pour over 
all melted lard, and when this is cool, cover closely with paraffin- 
paper fitted over the top of the jar. Keep in a cool room until 
wanted. This corn must be soaked for six or eight hours before 
using. It will then be fresh and sweet. 



Canned asparagus 

Into an asparagus boiler put salted water, and when it boils 
hard lay the asparagus in it. Boil until tender, but not broken 
and soft. Lift out carefully, stand on end (with the tops up) in 
fruit- jars, fill the jars to overflowing with the boiling water, and 
seal immediately. Be sure that tops and rubbers are in good con- 
dition, and keep this delicate vegetable in a cool, dark, dry place. 

Canned beets (fto. 1) 

Take early beets that have grown quickly, cook and peel as for 
immediate use, slice and pack in fruit jars. Be sure that rubbers 
and tops are in excellent order. Boil good cider vinegar that is 
not too strong, adding pepper and salt to taste, and a tablespoon- 
ful of sugar. While boiling, pour over the packed beets in the 



692 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

jars, fill to overflowing, and immediately screw down the tops 
tight. Wrap in brown paper and put in a very dark place. They 
keep well, and are superior to beets bought later in the season. 



Canned beets (No. 2) 

Prepare the beets as for immediate use. Leave on two or 
three inches of top to prevent bleeding; also be very careful not 
to cut or break the skin. Boil, and when done (which should be 
done in one-half or three-quarters of an hour) pour off the hot 
water, and replace with cold. Let the beets cool in the water, so 
that you can handle them. While the beets are cooling, put into 
an agate or porcelain kettle enough vinegar for the quantity that 
you are preparing. Add two cupfuls of granulated sugar to a 
quart of the vinegar, with pepper and salt to taste. Slice the cool 
beets, put them into the hot vinegar, let them remain on the fire 
until heated through, then put into air-tight jars. 

Canned string beans 

Remove all the strings from both sides of the beans. Cut the 
beans into inch lengths and cover with water. Boil until tender, 
but not soft. Season with salt and pepper. Take the beans from 
the pot with a perforated spoon, and put them in jars standing in 
a pan of hot water. Boil up and skim the liquor remaining in the 
kettle, and fill the jars to the brims with this. Seal at once. 

Canned lima beans 

Shell, cook for fifteen minutes in boiling water slightly salted. 
Then proceed as with string beans.

Southern recipe for whitewash 

Boil one pound of rice in five gallons of water until soft and 
broken. Strain and rub the rice through a colander back into 
the water, and while it is still boiling stir into it one peck of best 
lime, with a pound of salt. Boil up once and apply hot. 

It makes a glossy and durable covering for wood and walls. 



How to clean kid gloves 

Lay them upon a folded towel and pull straight. Have ready 
several pieces of fine, soft old flannel. Dip one in skim-milk, rub 
upon sweet soap or old castile and wash the gloves, working 
toward the finger-tips. As soon as the flannel becomes soiled, 
throw it into warm water and soak, and take a clean bit. Go all 
over both sides of each glove in this way until the flannel brings 
away no more dirt. Wash off with clean flannel wrung out in the 
milk with no soap. Lay between the folds of a clean towel and 
leave until next day. The gloves will look unsightly enough, but 
put them on your hands and they will resume their original color, 
and, if the work has been done well, will look almost like new. 

A rose jar (potpourri) 

Gather rose petals when the roses are in their richest bloom, 
but not when the dew is on them, and pack in a jar in layers two 
inches deep, sprinkling about two tablespoonfuls of fine, dry salt 
upon each layer. Continue this until the jar is full, adding fresh 
petals and salt daily. Keep in a dark, dry cool place. A week 

693 







694 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

after the last relay is gathered turn out the salted petals upon a 
broad platter, mix and toss together until the mass is loosened. 
Then incorporate thoroughly with the formula given below ; pack 
in a clean jar, cover lightly and set away to "ripen." It will be 
ready for rose jars, etc., in a fortnight, and, if kept covered, will 
be good and fragrant for twenty years. 

Formula Violet powder, one-half ounce ; orris root, one ounce ; 
rose powder, one-half ounce ; heliotrope powder, one-half ounce ; 
mace, one-half teaspoonful ; cinnamon, one-quarter teaspoonful ; 
cloves, one-half teaspoonful ; oil of roses, four drops ; oil chiris, 
ten drops; oil melissne, twenty drops; oil eucalyptus, twenty 
drops ; bergamot, ten drops ; alcohol, two drachms. 



A rose pillow 

If you wish to fill a pillow with rose leaves alone, spread the 
petals in the shade, but on a sunny day, and dry thoroughly before 
stuffing the pillow. Then scatter a tablespoonful of powdered 
orris root among them, and sprinkle with ten drops of real attar of 
roses. The inferior qualities will not hold the fragrance. Make 
the inner cover of glazed cambric, the outer of silk or satin, deco- 
rated to suit your fancy. 

Heat marks on tables 

Hot plates frequently disfigure tables by leaving on them a 
cloudy, white stain. This could be avoided if a mat were always 
placed between the hot plate and the table. The same with hot 
water jugs, etc. To remove the heat stains rub on a few drops 
of sweet oil, and afterwards polish with spirits of wine and a soft 
cloth. 

Or hold a hot iron a few inches above the spot until the wood 
regains color. Polish with a cloth wrung out in kerosene. 

If the spot be small, surround it with a muffin-ring, and let 
the hot iron rest on it a moment. It will confine the heat and rest 
the hand. 



"HANDY" HOUSEHOLD HINTS 695 



Match marks 

Marks that have been made on paint with matches can be re- 
moved by rubbing first, with a slice of lemon, then with whiting, 
and washing with soap and water. 



Library paste 

Wet up a cupful of best flour with cold water until you can stir 
it easily ; have on the fire a generous pint of boiling water and add 
the flour paste, spoonful by spoonful, to it, stirring all the time. 
Should it thicken too much, add more boiling water. Cook thus 
for ten minutes. Take it off and beat in a teaspoonful of carbolic 
acid. When cold put it into a wide-mouthed bottle, through the 
cork of which a paste brush is thrust. If you dislike the odor of 
carbolic acid, use salicylic acid in the same quantity, and add ten 
drops of oil of cinnamon. 

To remove the high-water mark from porcelain wash-bowls and 

bath-tubs 

Wet a flannel cloth with kerosene oil and thoroughly rub the 
tub; wash with scalding water, pouring some washing-soda dis- 
solved therein; dry thoroughly, and the tub will have a beautiful 
polish. 

TO "TENDER" TOUGH MEAT 

Beefsteak 

Hang it as long as it can be left with safety, washing over 
with vinegar every day. Take it down then, wipe with a clean, 
dry cloth, lay upon a dish and pour over it four or five spoonfuls 
of salad oil and the juice of a large lemon. Set in a cold place for 
several hours, turn it over and over, that it may soak up every 
drop of oil and lemon, and leave it for some hours longer. If it 
is for breakfast, do this over night. If for supper or a late dinner, 



696 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

begin the preparation in the early morning. Ten or twelve hours 
are better than four or five. 

When you are ready to cook the steak, hold it up for a minute 
to let the surplus oil drip from it, but do not wipe it. It will be 
more juicy for the oil bath. Broil quickly over clear coals, turning 
several times. 

A tough roasting piece 

Hang it in a cool cellar or meat safe up to the last point of pru- 
dence, washing it every day with vinegar. If you suspect a 
"high" odor, wash it with soda and water, rubbing every part of 
it with a clean whisk or brush ; then go all over it with vinegar 
or lemon juice before setting it down to roast. Baste frequently. 



SOME USEFUL THINGS WE THROW AWAY 

Bread dust 

Two or three times a week spread the accumulated scraps upon 
a tin plate, or in a baking-pan, and set in a moderate oven until 
perfectly dry. Soft or "soggy" bits are good for nothing and in- 
terfere with the work. If, by chance or intention, the bread is 
slightly browned, keep it apart from that which remains white. 
A glass jar for each kind is a good idea. 

While the dried bits are still warm, lay upon a kneading-board 
and crush to powder with the rolling-pin. Do this thoroughly 
for the "dust," leaving no gritty particles. Keep in a closed jar 
in a dry place. It is invaluable for breading croquettes, fried 
fish, chops, etc. Roll the article to be breaded, first in beaten egg, 
then in the bread dust, to which have been added a little salt and 
pepper. 

Dripping 

Save fat odds and ends of cooked meats, and skim every particle 
of the congealed grease from the top of gravies, soups and the 
liquor in which ham and other large pieces of meat are boiled. 



"HANDY" HOUSEHOLD HINTS 697 

Bring slowly to a gentle simmer over the fire, and strain, with- 
out rubbing, through a fine soup-sieve, or a bit of mosquito-netting. 
When firm it is better for frying than any fat you can buy, unless 
it be pure cottolene. 

Mutton and lamb fat 

Must be excluded from the "trying-out" pan. At its purest 
state it gives an unpleasant taste to anything cooked in it. Melt 
it in a saucepan ; when hot, add a little boiling water with a pinch 
of salt to cause the dregs to settle ; heat five minutes without boil- 
ing, strain, but do not stir or squeeze, into small molds, such as 
egg-cups. When hard you will have a better cosmetic than cold 
cream and an invaluable salve for chapped hands and lips. 

Broken crackers 

Spread upon a flat platter and leave in a moderate oven until 
dried, but not colored. Let them cool in a dry place ; crush fine 
with the rolling-pin and keep in a glass jar for breading chops, 
croquettes, etc., and for scalloping oysters, meat and other of the 
many made dishes that add character and variety to every-day fare. 

Bones of cooked meat 

Not those left on the plates after meals. They are the lawful 
perquisites of fowls and dogs. Bones cleaned by the carver, or 
the wise housemother, in the preparation of minces and stews and 
salads, should be laid in a spare dish, cracked through, while 
fresh, and put over the fire with a quart of cold water for every 
pound of bones, a carrot, a turnip, two tomatoes, an onion, a stalk 
or so of celery, all cut into dice, and boiled slowly until reduced to 
half the original quantity of liquid. Cool in the pot, skim and 
strain, and you have a tolerable "stock," useful for a great number 
of dishes. 

Rice water 

Always boil rice in plenty of water. When the grains are soft, 
but not broken, drain in a colander over a bowl, and not into the 



698 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

sink. Rice water contains more nourishment than the cooked 
cereal itself. Set aside for some hours and you have a jelly which 
will add value to your soup stock, or may be boiled down still 
further, sweetened slightly and flavored with rose-water or vanilla ; 
lastly, left in the ice or in cold place to form in a mold. Eaten 
with sugar and cream, it is a pleasant dessert. Beaten into a plain 
custard it is even better. It can also be used for thickening white 
sauces or gravies. 

Testing a broom 

When buying a broom test it by pressing the edge against the 
floor. If the straws bristle out and bend, the broom is a poor 
one. They should remain in a solid, firm mass. 

To clean brass 

Clean it with pulverized pumice-stone, wet with household 
ammonia, applying this paste first, and polishing the brass when 
this has dried, using for this purpose chamois skin. 

Wring out a flannel cloth in kerosene, rub upon Putz-Pomade, 
clean the brasses and polish with old linen. 

To clean a white fur rug 

First, beat out all the dust and hang in the wind for some hours. 
Then lay it on the floor of a room you seldom use and fill it with 
dried flour. Rub it into the rug as you would suds, rubbing be- 
tween your hands, and working with your fingers down to the 
roots of the fur. Cover with a clean cloth and leave all night with 
the flour in it. Next day take out of doors, shake out the flour, 
hang on a line and whip on the wrong side until every particle of 
flour is dislodged. 

Powdered chalk may be used instead of the flour, but if any is 
left in the rug the alkali may injure the fur. 

A few things kerosene will do 

For ants, saturate rags with kerosene, and hang, or lay these 
near their runs, and they will quickly disappear. 



"HANDY" HOUSEHOLD HINTS 699 

Kerosene is a household necessity at cleaning-time. For clean- 
ing painted and varnished woodwork, painted walls, varnished 
floors, bathtubs and marble washstands it is unsurpassed. For 
tubs and marble, apply with a woolen cloth, then wash with soap 
and water. For woodwork and walls use clean cloths, changing 
as soon as soiled. A few drops in the water when washing win- 
dows and mirrors will give them a beautiful polish. 

To clean white silk 

If one desires snowy whiteness, silk should never be allowed to 
become badly soiled; that is, so that the silk is yellowed. Dust 
the garment and wash in rather warm (not scalding hot) water 
with Ivory soap. Rinse well, the last water being quite blue. 
Hang up and allow to get just dry enough to press nicely with a 
warm iron. If this is followed out, I know that white silk will 
stay white. Care must be taken with the blue water not to have it 
too blue, and yet blue enough to help the silk retain the "new" 
shade. 

Should silk merely need sponging no iron should touch the sur- 
face. If rolled while damp on a broomstick, it will dry in a day 
or so. When there are grease spots, apply the time-honored rem- 
edy, powdered magnesia, to the wrong side under a cold pressure ; 
then, after some hours, rub off, and if not wholly cleansed, apply 
again. 

To clean yellow lace 

If you desire to keep the lace yellow, pour enough gasoline into 
an earthen crock to cover the lace, shake it about in the liquid, 
rubbing soiled spots gently between your hands ; immerse it fully 
in the liquid, cover the crock and leave the lace in the gasoline for 
five or six hours. Squeeze and shake it then, and leave it in the 
open air. When quite dry lay it on a clean cloth, spread over a 
board or table, and dampen slightly. Pull into shape with your 
fingers while it is damp. If the lace be wide, baste it to a thick, 
dampened cloth, setting a stitch in every scallop and figure. Cover 
with a thin, damp cloth, and press with a warm iron. 



;oo MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

To clean Battenberg embroidery 

First make a suds of warm water (not hot) with a bland, white 
soap ; wash the pieces, and if very much soiled, rub a little soap 
on the Battenberg on the wrong side, then rinse thoroughly, but 
do not blue. Wring out, put between two folds of soft cloth 
and pat with the hands. Hang in a shady place for a while to 
take most of the moisture out. 

Spread a sheet on the floor and take your pieces, one at a time. 
First, pin the linen from the corners, as you would a curtain, 
where the Battenberg joins the linen. When you have the linen 
perfectly smooth, begin on lace, and pull out well so as to get the 
same shape as when new ; put plenty of pins in, so that the edges 
will be well shaped. This will take you a little longer than if 
ironed, but the iron takes all color out of embroidery, and it 
never does Battenberg well. When you have your piece all pinned 
down, take your fingers and smooth down the flowers while wet ; 
they will look like new. 

To clean black lace 

If it be real lace you can treat it at home with reasonable hope 
of success. 

Boil a black kid glove in a quart of water until you have reduced 
the liquid by one-third. Squeeze the glove and throw it away. 
When you can bear your hand comfortably in the water dip and 
shake the lace in it up and down a dozen times. Shake off the 
wet and squeeze the lace s in a soft towel. Do not wring it. While 
wet, begin to pull the lace straight with the tips of your fingers, 
getting every mesh and bit of the edge into the right shape. It 
must be in order and still damp when laid upon the ironing-cloth. 
Spread a piece of old cambric or linen, or, better still, a piece of 
clean tissue paper over it, and iron on the right side ; then, and 
harder, on the wrong, to bring out the pattern. 

Hang in the sun or in any hot, dry place to dry quickly. Roll 
upon a card or a thin board to preserve the smoothness. 



"HANDY" HOUSEHOLD HINTS 701 

To dry-clean white lace 

Wash in flour. Rub the flour in as you would soap; let the 
lace lie for some time and then shake it out. If it be not quite 
clean, repeat the process, which will make it look like new. 

To get rid of bed-bugs 

To get rid of "red rovers" (or bed-bugs) simply apply a good, 
thick coat of varnish to all lurking places. 

OR 

Get a clean oil-can, fill it with gasoline and inject into all cracks 
and crannies where they can possibly hide. Shut the room up for 
some hours to give the gasoline a fair chance to do its work. 

To get rid of rats and mice 

Smear the entrance of their holes with liquid tar, and spray the 
holes as far as a bellows will carry it with powdered, unslaked 
lime ; 

OR 

After the holes are located, fill them deeply with absorbent 
cotton; moisten with formaldehyde; the holes are then quickly 
cemented with plaster of paris. Then let the neighbors do the 
worrying. 

For mange in cats 

Mix vaseline with a drop of two or diluted carbolic acid, as 
put up in the drug stores as an antiseptic and healing salve. A 
very little placed on the affected part and a clean linen rag tied 
around it will heal the skin and cause a new growth of fur. 

To draw thread in linen 

To draw thread for hem-stitching make a good lather of soap 
and water, and brush this over the linen where threads are to be 



7 02 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

drawn, using a shaving or other soft brush. Let it dry, and they 
will pull quite easily. 

To clean decanters 

Never use shot, for there is danger of its causing lead poison- 
ing. Instead, try the effect of a little soapy water and some fine 
sand. Shake the decanter till the glass is clean and then rinse with 
fresh water, finally with alcohol. 

To clean hardwood furniture 

Make a solution of two heaping tablespoonfuls of sal soda to 
a quart of warm water, put it on with a tooth-brush well soaped, 
the place being immediately rinsed with cold water and dried with 
a soft cloth. 

Afterward the wood should be rubbed with a mixture of two- 
thirds raw oil and one-third turpentine with a little salt. 

The secret of success lies in cleaning only a small piece at a 
time and in doing the work rapidly. 

Cement for lining an aquarium 

Take white lead, such as you buy in a keg, thicken with as little 
of the oil as possible, and mix some dry red lead with it. Put in 
just enough burnt umber to make it the color of black walnut, 
a little Japan drier and a very little varnish. Paint the edges of the 
glass and let it dry, or this will not stick. After cementing the 
aquarium, let it stand two weeks to harden before putting water 
in it. 

Washing fluid for removing stains 

You can take all the red laundry marks out of a linen by using 
the following washing fluid. It will also take rust, ink and mil- 
dew out without leaving a trace : 

Five pounds washing-soda, one gallon of cold water, put to a 
boil. While boiling add one pound of chloride of lime and stir 
well ; set aside to settle ; strain through a cloth and cork up in a 



"HANDY" HOUSEHOLD HINTS 703 

jug. Put your soiled clothes in ten quarts of water, or enough 
to cover them, with two handfuls of chipped soap and one pint 
of the jugged fluid. Let them boil, raising them up once in a 
while with the clothes-stick. If the marks do not disappear, add 
a little more of the fluid, but not too much, or it will eat .into the 
clothes. 

To kill an evil odor 

Dried orange-peel, allowed to smolder on a piece of red-hot 
iron, or on an old shovel, will kill any bad odor in a room and 
leave a fragrant one behind. 

To clean oil paintings 

Cut a raw potato in half, rub quickly over the surface of an oil 
painting, after which polish with a silk handkerchief to remove 
dust or dirt. 

To keep leather from cracking 

Add a drop or two of neat's- foot oil to the shoe-blacking to 
prevent the leather from cracking. It is also fine to use on damp 
boots or shoes. 

How to keep palms 

If you want your palms to thrive in an ordinary sitting-room, 
sponge the leaves once a week with lukewarm water, to which 
a little milk has been added. Then stand the plant for two hours 
in lukewarm water deep enough to completely cover the pot. This 
is the proper way to water palms. 

One way to remove iron rust 

One method of taking iron mold out of linen is to hold the spots 
over a pitcher of boiling water and rub them with the juice of 
sorrel and salt, and then, when the cloth is thoroughly wet, to dip 
it quickly in lye and wash at once.

To clean a light cloth gown 

Lay the gown on a table, spread out smoothly and cover with 
powdered fuller's earth shaken through a sieve. Hang, without 
shaking, in a dark closet for twenty-four hours; then shake and 
brush in the open air. 

To get rid of plant-lice 

Put the plants into a closet from which you have cleared every- 
thing else, and set on the floor a pan containing refuse broken 
tobacco. Light the tobacco, and shut the closet up for five or six 
hours. Soak the earth in the pots with tobacco tea, made by pour- 
ing boiling water upon the tobacco stems and letting it cool. You 
can brush up the tiny insects by the hundred. To make sure they 
will not come to life, burn all you sweep up. 

To take dry ink out of a carpet 

Rub into the spot as much thick buttermilk, made into a paste 
with table salt, as the place will hold. This may tone down the 
inkiness. Cover the wet paste with paper to exclude light and 
dust, and leave it alone for six hours. Wash, then, with house- 
hold ammonia and warm water ; rub dry, and make a second appli- 
cation of salt and buttermilk, covering as before. 

To get rid of the smell of paint 

To remove the smell of paint from a room leave in it over night 
a pail of water with three or four sliced raw onions in it. Shut 
the door, and in the morning the paint smell will have gone, the 
onions and water absorbing it.

To polish patent leather 

To polish patent leather remove every particle of dust, and 
apply a mixture of one part linseed oil to two parts cream. It 
should be well mixed and applied with a flannel. Rub the leather 
well with a soft, dry cloth. 



To clean linoleum 

If the linoleum be wiped first with a cloth dipped in warm 
water, and wrung as dry as possible, then wiped over with skimmed 
milk once a week, the colors will be lightened, and the varnish, 
which protects the colors, will be longer preserved. Soften ob- 
stinate spots with a little linseed oil. If the whole floor is treated 
once a month with linseed oil, using as little as possible, and rub- 
bing all superfluous oil off, it will wear longer and the color will 
be brighter. If the varnish is entirely removed in any part, a 
mixture of one part lac varnish and three parts oil will restore it. 

To renew cane-seat chairs 

Cane chair seats that have sagged may be tightened by washing

How to keep patent-leather shoes 

% 

Put them on, and as soon as they are warmed by the natural 
heat of the foot, rub with the palm of the hand until you are sensi- 
ble that the moisture of the skin is lubricating the leather. Five 
minutes spent in this way whenever you wear the shoes will 
keep them in goo*d order. About once a week put three drops of 
neat's-foot oil into your hand, hold it until blood-warm, and rub 
it thoroughly into the leather. Cold weather induces cracking 
in patent leather. Gentle warmth prevents it.

To clean russet shoes 

Russet shoes may be kept clean and bright by rubbing them with 
a slice of banana and polishing with a cloth. 

To clean black cloth 

Use warm water and alcohol in the proportion of about one or 
two tablespoonfuls of alcohol to a pint of water; goods sponged 
with it and pressed will look like new. Alcohol is not harmful 
to any goods, but ammonia will leave certain colors streaked un- 
less evenly distributed. Alcohol is excellent for cleaning and 
brightening jet trimming. 

To remove grease spots from cloth 

Get at the back of the spots ; i. e., the wrong side of the stuff, 
and rub into each spot as much powdered French chalk as it will 
hold. Leave it all night. Then lay soft blotting or tissue paper 
over the chalk and press with a warm iron, changing the paper as 
the grease "draws" through. Brush out the chalk, and the spot 
should have disappeared, unless a trace remains on the right side 
of something, which is not grease, but adherent dust. Sponge 
this with household ammonia. 

To take out mildew 

Make a thick paste of table salt and buttermilk, and cover the 
mildew with it. Lay in the hot sun for a day, renewing the paste 
at the end of four hours. If obstinate, repeat next day. Should 
a trace of the stain remain, cyanide of potassium will eradicate 
it. Moisten the spot with water, rub in the powder and lay in the 
sun for four hours, moistening the place twice in this time. Then 
wash at once with pure water. You can get the cyanide of potas- 
sium from the drug store. It is a deadly poison, if taken in- 
ternally.

How to dry-clean a lace curtain 

Pin a sheet snugly to the carpet, and pin the curtain smoothly 
to the sheet. Go all over it with flour you have dried in the oven, 
rubbing it into the lace with what is known as a "complexion 
brush" until the whole surface is coated and the curtain will hold 
no more. Throw a sheet over all and leave for twenty-four 
hours. At the end of this time unpin the curtain, lift carefully, 
shake out the flour and hang in the outer air and sunshine (the 
day must be dry) to let the flour blow out of it. Lastly, lay it upon 
the ironing-table, wrong side up, cover with clean cheese-cloth, 
or thin muslin slightly dampened, and press firmly with a warm, 
not a hot, iron. 

Powdered starch may be used instead of flour. Curtains treated 
carefully in this way will look almost as fresh as when new. 

A trio of useful hints 

Perfumed olive oil sprinkled on library shelves will prevent 
mold on books. 

Mud stains can be removed from black cloth by rubbing them 
with a raw potato. 

The juice of a raw onion applied to the sting of an insect will 
remove the poison. 

How to add to one's stature 

If you will take simple stretching exercises two or three times 
a day for a year your height will increase. Rising on toes and 
stretching the tips of the fingers as far toward the ceiling as they 
will go, and sweeping hands over front, touching tips of fingers 
or palm of hand to floor, keeping both knees straight, are excel- 
lent exercises if one would grow. 

A skin tonic 

A bag made of cheese-cloth, doubled and filled with bran, a 
teaspoonful of orris root and a half cake of Castile soap, chopped 



;o8 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

fine, makes an excellent skin tonic for the bath. After using it 
for several weeks the skin will be smooth, firm and white. 

How to care for the hands 

When the hands are stained by fruit or vegetables, remove the 
stains before the hands come in contact with soap or soapy water. 
Remove the stains with an acid, such as lemon, vinegar or sour 
milk, then wash in clear water. 

When using soap and water for any purpose, rinse off all the 
soap before wiping the hands. Always wipe the hands perfectly 
dry. Do not change soaps if you can avoid it, and always use a 
good soap. 

To soften and whiten the hands 

Use some sort of cream on them at night, then powder them 
and put them in loose gloves kept for this purpose. 

Habitual use of Holmes' Fragrant Frostilla will keep the hands 
smooth, white, and prevent chapping in the winter. 

To keep piano keys clean and white 

Dampen a piece of muslin with alcohol, and with it rub the 
keys. If this does not remove the stains, use a piece of cotton 
flannel wet with cologne water. The keys can also be bleached 
white by laying over the keys cotton flannel cloths that have 
been saturated with a solution of oxalic acid. 

A washing compound 

Shave a pound bar of good, common laundry soap ; put it into 
a kettle holding about six or eight quarts. Add two quarts of 
water to the soap, and boil until all of it is dissolved. Take it to 
the dooryard, or on the porch outside of the house in the open 
air, and add one-half pint of gasoline before the soap cools off. 
It will immediately foam and boil up until the kettle is full. Let 
it stand until it has cooled off somewhat. 

The clothes should be soaked first in lukewarm water, or even 



"HANDY" HOUSEHOLD HINTS 709 

cold water, wrung out and put into suds made of this compound 
and quite hot water, then rubbed as usual; or it can be used in 
the washing-machine. Some may also be put in the boiler with- 
out the least danger. 

It softens the water and loosens dirt, and the clothes keep white. 
It does not injure colored goods any more than the laundry soap 
by itself would. 

As usual, in using gasoline, be sure to take proper precautions 
about mixing it anywhere near fire. 

Starch for black lawns, etc. 

Boil two quarts of wheat bran in six quarts of water for half 
an hour. Let it get cold, then strain. You will need neither soap 
nor starch if you use this. If thick, add cold water. This prepa- 
ration will both cleanse and stiffen. 

Whitewash that will not rub off 

Dissolve glue in hot water and add in the proportion of a pint 
of this water to four gallons of whitewash ; or dissolve an ounce 
of gum arabic in a pint of boiling water and stir in, observing the 
same proportions. Before applying this or any other wash, scrape 
the wall clean and smooth. Do not leave any of the old on. 

How to clean a straw hat 

Go all over it with damp corn-meal, rubbing it in well. Next 
apply dry meal, work thoroughly into the straw and leave it on 
for some hours. Brush out the meal and wash freely with per- 
oxide of hydrogen. Let it dry in the shade. 

The care of hardwood floors 

The daily care of the hardwood floor is very simple. A room 
that is much used must first be swept with a soft-haired brush, 
then wipe with a long-handled dust-mop or with a cotton flannel 
bag put over a broom. If there are spots on the floor they should 



;io MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

be rubbed with a flannel cloth. If this does not remove them, 
clean with a little turpentine on a piece of cloth. The floor should 
be thoroughly cleaned and polished twice a year. If any water 
should get spilled on them it must be wiped up at once. Any 
liquid spilled on a waxed floor will produce a stain if left to dry, 
which can only be removed by hard rubbing and the encaustic. 

A good floor polish 

Melt not quite half a pound of beeswax and pour it into a 
quart of turpentine, then add five cents worth of ammonia. Put 
it in a' tin pail and set it in another vessel containing hot water, 
and leave it on the back part of the stove to heat. Keep warm 
while using, for it goes on better. Apply with a flannel cloth, 
and polish with a piece of Brussels carpet. 

To clean hairbrushes 

Put a tablespoonful of ammonia into a basin of tepid water and 
dip the brushes up and down in it until they are clean. Dry with 
the bristles down, and they will be like new. 

To wash blankets 

Pour into a tub half a pint of household ammonia and lay a 
blanket over it; cover immediately with lukewarm water. This 
sends the fumes of the ammonia through the blanket and loosens 
the dirt. The blanket should then be stirred about with a stick 
and pressed until all the dirt seems to be in the water, then rinse 
in a tub of clear water of the same temperature as the first, run 
lightly through a wringer and hang out to dry. 

To keep tinware from rusting 

If the tinware is new rub over carefully with fresh lard and 
heat thoroughly before it is used.

How to clean marble 

To two parts of common baking-soda add one of pumice-stone 
and one of fine salt. Sift the mixture through a sieve and mix it 
with water, then rub it well all over the marble and the stains will 
all be removed. Wash with a strong solution of salt and water, 
rinse with clear water and wipe dry. 



To remove old tea and coffee stains 

Wet the stains with cold water, cover with glycerine and let 
stand for two or three hours, then, wash in cold water and soap. 
Repeat if necessary. 



To wash windows and mirrors 

A little turpentine dissolved in warm water is the best thing 
with which to wash windows and mirrors. A little alcohol will 
also do wonders in brightening glass. 



To remove grass stain 

Cover the stain with common cooking molasses and let stand for 
two or three hours. Wash in lukewarm water. Repeat the 
process if necessary. 



To take out machine grease 

Cold water, ammonia and soap will take out machine grease 
where other things would fail on account of making the colors 
run. 

What to do till the doctor comes 

Croup: Hot fomentations, flannels wrung out of boiling water, 
should be applied to the throat, and, if necessary, a warm bath 
given. Give a teaspoonful of wine of ipecac, or the same quantity 
of powdered alum stirred into syrup, molasses or honey. Some- 



;i2 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

times a few drops of kerosene on brown sugar will relieve the 
tightness. 

W hooping cough: Steaming the throat with thirty drops of 
pure carbolic acid in two and one-half pints of boiling water is said 
to be an excellent remedy. A half teaspoonful of kerosene will 
often relieve the paroxysms of coughing when nothing else will 
do it. 

Antidotes for poisons 

For laudanum, morphine and opium: First give a strong 
emetic of mustard and water, then very strong coffee and acid 
drinks; dash cold water on the head, and keep in constant mo- 
tion. 

For arsenic : Give, just as quickly as possible, an emetic of mus- 
tard and salt, a tablespoonful of each in a cupful of warm water ; 
then follow with sweet-oil, warmed butter, or milk. You may 
also use the white of an egg in half a cupful of milk or lime water. 
Get a doctor as soon as possible. 

For ammonia : Give lemon juice or vinegar. 

For acids: Give magnesia, soda, or soap dissolved in water 
every two minutes ; then use the stomach-pump, or an emetic. 

For belladonna: Give an emetic of mustard, salt and water; 
then drink plenty of vinegar and water, or lemonade. 

For "white lead" and "sugar of lead" : Give an emetic, then 
follow with castor oil, epsom salts or some other good cathartic. 



HOW TO BTJILD A FIRE 

Before attempting to use a range (or stove) one should know 
something about its construction, and the appliances that are 
afforded for its regulation. An ordinary cooking range is sup- 
plied with dampers, drafts and checks to regulate the direction 
and intensity of the heat. 

When the range is clean and cold examine it carefully. A lever 
will be found (often directly above the oven door) which when 
pulled out or pushed in (or turned to right or left) will allow the 



"HANDY" HOUSEHOLD HINTS 713 

heat and the smoke to go directly into the chimney flue, or through 
the range and around the oven indirectly into the flue. Well 
down below the fire-box is the draft (a door), which when open 
allows the outside (cold) air to rush in and force the fire to burn 
more rapidly. Above the fire-box, near the top of the stove, are 
the checks (a door with slides) that allow the outside (cold) air 
to come in above the burning fuel, and depress its combustion. 

It is readily seen when the smoke damper and the draft are 
open, with the checks closed, that the greatest intensity of heat 
and the most rapid combustion are obtained. In this way the top 
part of the stove directly over the fire-box may be heated quickly 
and intensely. When an emergency arises this is the quickest 
way to boil the water in the kettle or to cook immediately on the 
top of the stove. However, the tax on fuel is excessive and 
wasteful when the damper and drafts both are open. When dam- 
per and drafts are closed and the check open, the fire burns most 
slowly and the heat radiated is least intense. 

A wood fire 

When ready to lay the fuel and build the fire in a cold stove, be 
sure that the fire-box and ash-pits are clean and free from ashes 
and clinkers. Then open the damper and the drafts and close the 
checks. The fuel should always be put in from the top after re- 
moving the lids over the fire-box. Place the paper, slightly 
crumpled (never a number of sheets flat together), on the grating 
in the bottom of the fire-box. Lay the kindling on the paper 
loosely with the sticks across one another so that air may circu- 
late freely between them. Place stove wood on the kindling in 
the same manner. Light the paper from below after replacing the 
lids on the stove. When the fire is burning freely close damper 
and drafts. 

A quick wood fire 

When a quick wood fire is required for only a few moments' 
use, lay the fuel as usual, except to use about one-third the 
amount of paper and kindling and only two or three sticks of 



7 i4 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

stove wood. Build the fire well back in the fire-box next to the 
oven, with the smoke damper and drafts wide open. The draft 
is much stronger in the back of the fire-box and the fire therefore 
burns more readily. 

A hard-coal fire 

If hard coal (anthracite) is to be used, wait until the wood is 
burning well and then cover with a thin layer of coal. As soon 
as this is thoroughly ignited put in more coal and close the damper 
into the chimney flue. The fire-box should never be filled more 
than two-thirds full. 

A soft-coal fire 

A soft-coal fire is laid in the same way, except that this fuel 
requires less kindling and ignites more readily than anthracite. 
The stove wood may be omitted if the kindling is of good size. In 
using bituminous (soft) coals the flues need cleaning oftener ; but 
in any case these should be kept free from soot. Especially the 
flues around the oven should be cleaned once in ten days. If 
neglected the oven does not bake well, becomes too hot or will not 
heat at the bottom, and causes much annoyance. 

Kerosene and other explosive oils should not be used to kindle 
the fire. When the stove wood or kindling is damp, patience and 
an extra supply of paper will be more effectual and less dangerous. 



FINAL FAMILIAR TALK 

EMERGENCIES, BROKEN CHINA, AND 
"IN CASE OF" 

A READY command of expedients is the hall-mark of the canny 
housekeeper. The ability to snatch safety from apparent ruin, 
like a brand from the burning, is a faculty with some. It may be 
acquired by many, if not all. The experienced housemother is 
slow to believe in the possibility of irreparable disaster. There is 
no such word as "defeat" in her dictionary. Absolute success is 
not always to be had, but there are grades of success in cookery, 
as in political preferment. When Mrs. Faintheart sits down to 
weep over spilt milk, Mrs. Resolute bethinks her of something that 
will take the place of the milk. 

She reminds herself also that milk is greasy, and the spot not 
easily removed if it is allowed to soak into the silk, woolen or other 
unwashable fabric. By the time the milky-way spreads itself 
over carpet or gown she has a soft brush, warm water and house- 
hold ammonia in hand, sponges, scrubs and rinses this last with 
warm, clear water then rubs dry with a soft linen cloth. 

In case of a broken ink-bottle, or upset inkstand upon a carpet, 
wash immediately with skim-milk, using a clean sponge. Soak 
the ink and the milk up together, squeezing the sponge hard each 
time. When the ink disappears, cleanse the sponge well and wash 
the place again with warm water and ammonia. Lastly, scrub 
with a clean, stiff brush dipped in warm water and ammonia, fol- 
lowing the threads of the carpet. If these directions are obeyed 
faithfully the carpet will be brighter than before the accident. 

In case of claret or fruit stains upon table-cloth or napkin hold 
the stained part tightly over a bow r l and pour boiling water through 
it for three or four minutes, using clean water every time. 

715 



7i6 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

In case of mildewed linen, rub together equal parts of white 
soap (old Castile is best) and powdered starch. Make a soft paste 
of these with lemon juice, and coat the mildew on both sides of 
the linen thickly with the paste. Lay in the hot sun for several 
hours, wetting the paste well with lemon juice every hour. Wash 
off the coating with clear water, and if any sign of the mildew re- 
mains renew the application. 

In case of ants in cupboard or refrigerator, scour the shelves 
well with hot water and borax. Dry in the sun if the shelves are 
portable, then sprinkle thickly with dry borax. It is odorless and 
harmless, and may be used freely. 

In case of soured dough, stir an even teaspoonful of bicarbonate 
of soda, better known as baking-soda, into a cupful of warm water ; 
turn the over-risen dough upon a board and work in the soda- 
water, gradually, until all is absorbed. If the dough is so soft 
that it runs, add a little sifted flour as you go on. Knead thor- 
oughly and set for the last rising, taking care this is not in a hot 
place. I have seen an apparently hopeless batch of dough re- 
deemed in this way. 

In case of meat that has a "close" smell, yet is not actually 
tainted, wash well in soda and water, rubbing it well into every 
crack and line ; wash off with fresh iced water ; leave in salted iced 
water for half an hour, wash again with fresh, wipe quickly until 
perfectly dry, and cook at once. 

In case of boiling milk more than eight hours old in summer, 
or twelve in winter, drop in a bit of baking-soda the size of a 
pea for each quart when you put the milk over the fire. I have 
boiled cream in this way without curdling it. Bear in mind that 
the first stage of decomposition is acid, and treat suspected food 
with soda as the most convenient and harmless of alkalies. 

In case of curdled mayonnaise, whip the yolk of a fresh egg 
smooth and thick and stir into the curdled dressing. 

Nothing brings me more closely in touch with my sister house- 
mother than the request, "Will you tell me what to do in case 
of" let the exigency be a shattered hope, an aching heart, a 
hankering after a mission, or broken china. 

The dismay of the housewife over the destruction of her brittle 



FINAL FAMILIAR TALK 717 

treasures dates far back of the poetical precision who makes her 
ability to be "mistress of herself though china fall," the test of 
breeding. I suspect, if the truth were known, we should learn 
that the potsherd, picked up from the ash-heap by hapless, skin- 
smitten Job, marked an evil day in the calendar of his shrewish 
wife and the unlucky servant through whose carelessness pot, or 
cup, or platter came to grief. Furthermore, that the broken uten- 
sil belonged to a set that could not be matched in any china-shop 
in the length and breadth of Uz. 

I read, yesterday, in one of the "Be-thrifty-and-you-will-be- 
prosperous" essays, that are as rusty needles in the thick of the 
thumb of the woman of experience, an anecdote of a notable man- 
ager who still uses the same "snow-drop figure" napery affected 
by her mother and her grandmother before her, and the same 
pattern of china and cut-glass that set forth their tables. Hence 
the hateful "Hence" that breaks off the needle-point in the 
flesh ! "she has no difficulty in matching worn-out and fractured 
articles of household use." Queen Victoria had a similar fad. 
When the chair and sofas of Windsor got shabby they were 
spirited away, one by one, without her knowledge (presumably), 
and recovered with stuff of the same design and color, artistically 
dimmed and frayed so as to resemble the old exactly. Queens 
can afford to have expensive and almost impossible whims. The 
drawback to imitation of Mrs. Guelph's and Mrs. Notable's senti- 
mental economics is that crockery, glass and linen merchants do 
not carry dead stock. When a pattern becomes unfashionable 
it disappears from the market. The moral and exasperating 
"Hence" should have a corollary in the shape of a card, telling us 
where Mrs. Notable finds benevolent tradesmen who replenish 
her stores with snow-drop damask and fifty-year-old designs in 
"fragiles." 

A friend writes to me of the death of her colored butler, after 
twenty-three years' service in her family. 

"He was not particularly bright or brisk," she says, "and had 
some grave faults. But he did not break or chip one piece of 
glass or china while he was with us. Do you wonder that we 
mourn him ?" 



718 MARION HARLAND'S COOK BOOK 

Considered as a means, of grace and of daily discipline in the 
fine order of breeding indicated by our poet, our waitress what- 
ever her race, age, or previous condition of sovereignty leaves 
little to the liveliest imagination. She ''blazes" her trail through 
our households by nicks, cracks, breaks and "crazed" glazing. 

There is a hill near Rome composed entirely of broken pottery 
The modern housekeeper does not enter into the social specula- 
tions of archaeologists as to its origin and history. Women loved 
china in those older days as fondly as we love it. Perhaps for 
it was an age of idols, many and curious they set it among their 
household goods. At any rate, when it was shattered, they gave 
it decent burial. If the dust-heaps and ash-barrels of Christian 
America were made to give up the like relics deposited in guilty 
haste and secrecy within their unhallowed depths the woeful pile 
would dwarf the Tower of Babel by comparison, and represent as 
many tears as any national cemetery. 

In view of the frail constitution of our well-beloved china, we 
ought not to set our hearts upon it any more than we ought to 
love our babies, whose tenure upon life is more slight than spider's 
silk. One and all, we do set our affections, and feast our eyes, and 
pamper our souls' desires upon the adornments of buffet and china- 
closet. Tea, coffee and chocolate are more delicious when sipped 
from Sevres and Limoges ; our sensitive finger-tips recoil from the 
blunt edges of pressed glass. To set stone china and thick tum- 
blers before tired and hungry John would insult one who deserves 
the best of everything. 

Since, then, we must, in justice to him and to ourselves, have 
fine china and glass, and our waitress's tumultuous voyagings 
among them will strew back yards and vacant lots with the worth- 
less flotsam and jetsam of what was dear and precious, what shall 
be done? To the housekeeper whose time has not a prohibitive 
monetary value, my advice is simple and direct: Have choice 
china the choicest you can afford and take care of it yourself.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

IT is so much easier to measure ingredients than to weigh them 
that the housewife saves time and work by acquainting herself 
with certain equivalent measures and weights. Without burden- 
ing her memory with a dry array of items and figures, I have col- 
lected here certain details to which she can refer quickly and con- 
fidently. 

"One cupful" of flour, milk, etc., means half a pint. 

Two scant cupfuls of packed butter make one pound. 

Two and a half even cupfuls of powdered sugar are one pound. 

Two cupfuls (one pint) of water or milk make one pound. 

Three even cupfuls of Indian meal make one pound. 

Four even cupfuls of dry flour make one pound. 

Two cupfuls (one pint) of water or milk make one pound. 

Ten eggs of ordinary size make one pound. 

Two cupfuls of minced beef, packed closely, make one pound. 

A gill of liquid is half a cupful. 

One heaping tablespoonful of granulated sugar is one ounce. 

Two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour make one ounce. 

Two heaping tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar make one ounce. 

Two heaping tablespoonfuls of ground coffee make one ounce. 

One tablespoonful of milk, vinegar or brandy make one-half 
ounce. 

The juice of an ordinary lemon is about a tablespoonful. A 
breakfast cupful of bread-crumbs well pressed in equals about 
four ounces. Very finely chopped suet, slightly heaped up, weighs 
about the same. A heaped breakfast cupful of brown sugar rep- 
resents half a pound, and stoned raisins well pressed in weigh 
about the same.
