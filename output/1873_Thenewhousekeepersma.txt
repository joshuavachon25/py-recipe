THE HOUSEKEEPEE'S MAIS^UAL. 

Part I. 
THE AMERICAN WOMAN'S HOME. 



The authors of this volume, while they sympathize with 
every honest effort to relieve the disabilities and sufferings 
of their sex, are confident that the chief cause of these evils 
is the fact that the honor and duties of the family state are 
not duly appreciated, that women are not trained for these 
duties as men are trained for their trades and professions, 
and that, as the consequence, family labor is poorly done, 
poorly paid, and regarded as menial and disgraceful. 

To be the nurse of young children, a cook, or a house- 
maid, is regarded as the lowest and last resort of poverty, 
and one which no woman of culture and position can as- 
sume without loss of caste and respectability. 

It is the aim of this volume to elevate both the honor 
and the remuneration of all the employments that sustain 
the many difficult and sacred duties of the family state, 
and thus to render each department of woman's true pro- 
fession as much desired and respected as are the most 
honored professions of men. 

The following will show, though very imperfectly, how 
many branches of science and training are included in 
woman's profession, and thus what needs to be attempted : 

First, the department of a housekeeper demands some 
knowledge of all the arts and sciences connected with the 
proper construction of a family dwelling. A widow, or a 
woman whose husband has not time or ability to direct.

14 TSE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

and in communities destitute of intelligent artisans, on 
building a house would need tlie guidance of the leading 
principles of architecture, pneumatics, hydrostatics, caloric 
fication, and several other connected sciences, in order to 
secure architectural beauty, healthful heating and ventila- 
tion, and the economical and convenient arrangements for 
labor and comfort. A housekeeper properly instructed in 
these principles would know how to secure chimneys that 
will not smoke, the most economical furnaces and stoves, 
and those that will be sure to " draw." She would know 
how dampers and air-boxes should be placed and regulated, 
how to prevent or remedy gas escapes, leaking water-pipes, 
poisonous recession of sewers, slamming shutters, bells that 
will not ring, blinds that will not fasten, and doors that 
will not lock or catch. She will understand about ball- 
cocks, and high and low pressure on water-pipes and 
boilers, and many other mysteries which make a woman 
the helpless victim of plumbers and other jobbers often as 
blundering and ignorant as herself. She would know 
what kind of wood-work saves labor, how to prevent its 
shrinkage, when to use paint, and what kind is best, and 
many other details of knowledge needed in circumstances 
to which any daughter of wealth is liable : knowledge 
which could be gained with less time and labor than is now 
given in public schools to geometry and algebra. 

On supposition of a ya/rd and garden, with young boys 
and domestic animals under her care, she would need the 
first principles of landscape gardening, floriculture, horti- 
culture, fruit culture, and agriculture ; also, the fitting and 
furnishing of accommodations and provision for domestic 
animals. And to gain this knowledge would demand less 
time than young girls often give to picking pretty flowers 
to pieces and saying hard names over them, or storing 
them in herbariums never used. And yet botany might be 
so taught as to be practically useful. 

Next, in seUctfmg fwniture, a woman so instructed 



TRB DUTIMS OF WOMAN'S PMOFESSWN. 15 

would know when glue and nails are improperly used in- 
stead of the needed dovetailing and mortising. She would 
know when drawers, tables, and chairs were properly made, 
and when brooms, pots, saucepans, and coal-scuttles would 
last well and do proper service. She would know the best 
colors and materials for carpets, curtains, bed and house 
linen, and numerous other practical details as easily learned 
as the construction of " bivalves" and " multivalves," and 
other particulars in natural history now studied, and, being 
of no practical use, speedily forgotten. 

Next, in the ornainentation of a house, she will need the 
general principles that guide in the making or selection of , 
pictures, statuary, in drawing, painting, music, and all the 
fine arts that render a home so beautiful and attractive. 

]!Text comes all involved in the cleam-smg, neatness, and 
order of houses filled with sofas, ottomans, curtains, pic- 
tures, musical instruments, and all the varied collection of 
beautiful and frail ornaments or curiosities so common. 
Every girl should be taught to know the right and the 
wrong way of protecting or cleansing every article, from 
the rich picture-frames and frescoes to the humblest crock- 
ery and stew-pan. And this would include much scientific 
knowledge as well as practical training. 

Next comes the selection of healthful food, the proper 
care of it, and the most economical and suitable modes of 
cooking. Here are demanded the first principles of physio- 
logy, animal chemistry, and domestic hygiene, with the 
practical applications. Thus instructed, the housekeeper 
will know the good or bad condition of meats, milk, bread, 
butter, and all groceries. And a class could be taken to a 
market or grocery for illustration as easily as to a museum or 
the field for illustrations of mineralogy or botany. All this 
should be done before a young girl has the heavy responsi- 
bilities of housekeeper, wife, mother, and nurse. The art 
of cookery, in all its departments, has received, more atten- 
tion than any other domestic duty in former days ; but at 



16 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

the present time "no systematic mode is devised for training 
a 3'oung girl to superintend and instruct servants in this 
complicated duty, on which the health and comfort of a 
family so much depend. 

Next, in providing family clothvng and in the care of 
household stuffs, she will know how to do, and to teach in 
the best manner plain sewing, hemming, darning, mend- 
ing, and the \ise of a sewing-machine, thus cultivating in- 
genuity, dexterity, and common sense in judging the best 
way of doing things and deciding what is worth doing and ' 
what is not. She will exercise good taste and good judg- 
ment in dress for herself and family, in the selection of 
materials, in the adaptation of colors and fashion to age, 
shape and employments, and in the avoidance of unhealth- 
ful and absurd fashions ; and she will have such knowledge 
of domestic chemistry as is needed in the cleansing, dyeing, 
and preservation of household clothing and stuffs. 

Next comes all involved in the care of health. This 
again involves the first principles of animal and domestic 
chemistry, hydrostatics, pneumatics, caloric, light, electri- 
city, and especially hygiene and therapeutics. A house- 
keeper instructed in these will have pure water, pure air, 
much sunlight, beds and clothes well cleansed, every 
arrangement for cleanliness and comfort, and all that 
tends to prevent disease or retard its first approaches. , 
And her knowledge and skill she will transmit to the 
children and servants under her care, while the dumb ani- 
mals of her establishment will share in the blessings se- 
cured by her scientific knowledge and trained skill. 

Next comes the care oi family expenses in all depart- 
ments of economy, and in which science and training are 
also demanded : to this add the enforcement of system and 
order, hospitalities to relatives, friends, and the homeless, 
the claims of society as to calls, social gatherings, the sick, 
the poor, benevolent associations, school and religious 
duties. 



TBE DUTIES OF WOMAN'' S PROFESSION. 17 

JSTot the least of the onerous duties of a housekeeper is 
the training and government of servants of all kinds of 
dispositions, habits, nationalities, and religions. 

AU.these multiplied and diverse duties are demanded of 
every woman, whether married or single, who becomes 
mistress of a house. 

The distinctive duties of wife and mother are such that 
both science and training are of the greatest consequence 
and a dreadful amount of suffering has resulted from want 
of such proper instruction. One of the most important of 
these duties is the care of new-born infants and their 
mothers. Thousands of young infants perish and young 
mothers are made sufferers for life for want of science and 
training in the mothers and monthly nurses. 

Then the helpers in the nursery have a daily control of 
the safety, health, temper, and morals of young children ; 
and a conscientious, careful, affectionate woman, instructed 
in the care of health and remedies for sudden accidents, is 
a rare treasure. These arduous duties are now extensively 
given to the inexperienced and the ignorant. It is a 
mournful fact that more science and care are given by 
professional trainers to the offsprin'g of horses, cows, sheep, 
and hogs, than to the larger portion of children of the Ameri- 
can people. Thus comes the fact that the mortality of the 
human offspring greatly exceeds that of the lower animals. 

The most difficult and important duties of a woman are 
those of an educator in the family and the school. In the 
nursery, children are taught the care of their bodies, the 
use of language, the nature and properties of the world 
around them, and many social and moral duties, all before 
books are used. Then it is a mother's duty to select the 
school-teacher, and so to supervise, that health and intellec- 
tual training shall be duly secured. To this add the duties 
of training and controlling the helpers in the nursery and 
kitchen, and to a housekeeper and mother the duties of an 
educator stand first on the roll of responsibiUties. 



18 THE HOUSEKEEPMR'S MANUAL. 

It is the conceded office of the school-teacher to con- 
duct intellectual and literary training ; but a woman in 
this position has also extensive control of the health, th^ 
habits, the opinions, and the moral character of her pupils, 
and often supplies deficient parental influences to an extent 
little realized. For this department of woman's profession 
more has been accomplished in preparing for future duties 
than in any other. 

It is for want of facilities for the proper scientific train- 
ing of women for these multiform duties that they are so 
generally not educated to be healthy, nor economical, or 
industrious, or properly qualified to be happy wives, or to 
train children and servants, or to preserve health in 
families and schools, or to practice a wise economy in the 
various departments of the family state. It is for want of 
such scientific training that the most important duties of 
the family, being disgraced and undervalued, are forsaken 
by the cultivated and refined, and, passing to the unskilled 
and vulgar, secure neither honorable social position nor 
liberal rewards. The poorest teacher of music, drawing, or 
French has higher position and reward than those who 
perform the most scientific, sacred, and difficult duties of 
the family state. 

The true remedy for this state of things is to provide as 
liberally for the scientific training of woman for her pro- 
fession as men have provided for theirs. A wide-spread 
attempt is organizing for the establishment of an institu- 
tion to cover this very ground of educating woman for 
the specific duties of her profession. But there are 
many thousands who are already beyond the reach of 
such instruction, and thousands of others who could never 
avail themselves of it ; and certain it is, that a gathering 
together, in a compact volume like the present one, of 
many facts and ideas bearing upon these all-important 
topics, will be of great advantage to readers, especially in 
remote districts, far from the conveniences of cities. 



THE DUTIES OF WOMAN^S PROFESSION. 19 

With such motives has this book been made, and it is 
hoped that its usefulness may be proved in many an 
American woman's home. 

Jesus Christ worked with his hands nearly thirty years, 
and preached less than three. And he taught that his 
kingdom is exactly opposite to that of the world, where all 
are striving for the highest positions. " "Whoso will be 
great shall be your minister, and whoso will be chiefest 
shall be servant of all." 

The family state is the aptest eatthly illustration of the 
heavenly kingdom, and in it woman is its chief minister. 
Her great mission is self-denial, in training its members to 
self-sacrificing labors for the ignorant and weak : if not her 
own children, then the neglected children of her Father in 
heaven. She is to rear all under her care to lay up trea- 
sures, not on earth, but in heaven. All the pleasures of 
this life end here ; but those who train immortal minds are 
to reap the fruit of their labor through eternal ages. 

To man is appointed the outdoor labor — to till the earth, 
dig the mines, toil in the foundries, traverse the ocean, 
transport merchandise, labor in manufactories, construct 
houses, conduct civil, municipal, and state affairs, and all 
the heavy work, which, most of the day, excludes him from 
the comforts of a home. But the great stimulus to all 
these toils, implanted in the heart of every true man, is 
the desire for a home of his own, and the hopes of pater- 
nity. Every man who truly lives for immortality responds 
to the beatitude, " Children are a heritage from the Lord : 
blessed is the man that hath his quiver full of them !" 
The more a father and mother live under the influence of 
that "immortality which Christ hath brought to light," 
the more is the blessedness of rearing a family understood 
and appreciated. Every child trained aright is to dwell 
forever in exalted bliss with those that gave it life and 
trained it for heaven. 



20 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

The blessed privileges of the family state are not con- 
fined to those who rear children of their own. Any wo- 
man who can earn a livelihood, as every woman should be 
trained to do, can take a properly qualified female asso- 
ciate, and institute a family of her own, receiving to its 
heavenly influences the orphan, the sick, the homeless, 
and the sinful, and by motherly devotion train them to 
foUow the self-denying example of Christ, in educating 
his earthly children for true happiaess in this life and foi* 
his eternal home. 

And such is the blessedness of aiding to sustain a truly 
Christian home, that no one comes so near the pattern of 
the All-perfect One as those who might hold what men call 
a higher place, and yet humble themselves to the lowest in 
order to aid in training the young, " not as men-pleasers, 
but as servants to Christ, with good-will doing service as 
to the Lord, and not to men." Such are preparing for 
high places in the kingdom of heaven. " Whosoever will 
be chiefest among you, let him be your servant." 

It is often the case that the true humility of Christ is 
not understood. It was not in having a low opinion of his 
own character and claims, but it was in taking a low place 
in order to raise others to a higher. The worldling seeks 
to raise himself and family to an equality with others, or, 
if possible, a superiority to them. The true follower of 
Christ comes down in order to elevate others. 

The maxims and institutions of this world have ever 
been antagonistic to the teachings and example of Jesus 
Christ. Men toil for wealth, honor, and power, not as 
means for raising others tp an equality with themselves, 
but mainly for earthly, selfish advantages. Although the 
experience of this life shows that children brought up to 
labor have the fairest chance for a virtuous and prosperous 
life, and for hope of future eternal blessedness, yet it is the 
aim of most parents who can do so, to lay up wealth that 
their children need not labor with the hands ae Christ did. 



TSE CMBISTIAN FAMILY. 21 

And although exhorted by our Lord not to lay up treasure 
on earth, but rather the imperishable riches which are 
gained in toiling to train the ignorant and reform the sin- 
ful, as yet a large portion of the professed followers of 
Christ, like his first disciples, are "slow of heart to be- 
lieve." 

Not less have the sacred ministries of the family state 
been undervalued and warred upon in other directions;, 
for example, the Komish Church has made celibacy a 
prime virtue, and given its highest honors to those who 
forsake the family state as ordained by God. Thus came 
great communities of monks and nuns, shut out from the 
love and labors of a Christian home ; thus, also, came the 
monkish systems of education, collecting the young in 
great establishments away from the watch and care of 
parents, and the healthful and self-sacrificing labors of a 
home. Thus both religion and education have conspired 
to degrade the family state. 

Still more have civil laws and social customs been op- 
posed to the priaciples of Jesus Christ. It has ever been 
assumed that the learned, the rich, and the powerful are 
not to labor with the hands, as Christ did, and as Paul 
did when he would " not eat any man's bread for naught, 
but wrought with labor, not because we have not power " 
[to live without hand-work,J " but to make ourselves an 
example." (2 Thess. 3.) 

Instead of this, manual labor has been made dishonora- 
ble and unrefined by being forced on the ignorant and 
poor. Especially has the most important of all hand-la- 
bor, that which sustains the family, been thus disgraced ; 
so that to nurse young children, and provide the food of a 
family by labor, is deemed the lowest of all positions in 
honor and profit, and the last resort of poverty. And so 
our Lord, who himself took the form of a servant, teaches, 
" How hardly shall they that have riches enter the king- 
dom of heavenJ." — that kingdom in which all are toiling 



22 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

to raise the weak, ignorant, and sinful to such equality 
with themselves as the childi-en of a loving family enjoy. 
One mode in which riches have led to antagonism with 
the true end of the family state is in the style of living, 
by which the hand-labor, most important to health, com- 
fort, and beauty, is confined to the most ignorant and neg- 
lected members of society, without any eifort being made 
to raise them to equal advantages with the wise and cul 
tivated. 

And, the higher civilization has advanced, the mor- 
have children been trained to feel that to labor, as did 
Christ and Paul, is disgraceful, and to be made the por- 
tion of a degraded class. Children of the rich grow up 
with the feeling that servants are to work for them, and 
they themselves are not to work. To the minds of most 
children and servants, "to be a lady," is almost synony- 
mous Avith "to be waited on, and do no worlf." It is the 
earnest desire of the authors of this volume to make plain 
the falsity of this growing popular feeling, and to show 
how much happier and more efficient family life will 
become when it is strengthened, sustained, and adorned 
by family work. 







II 



A CHEISTIAN HOUSE. 



In the Divine "Word it is written, " The wise woman build- 
cth her house." To be "wise," is "to choose the best 
means for accomplishing the best end." It has been shown

ministry, she will aim to secure a house so planned that it 
will provide in the best manner for health, industry, and 
economy, those cardinal requisites of domestic enjoyment 
and success. To aid in this," is the object of the following 
drawiilgs and descriptions, which will illustrate a style of 
living more conformed to the great design for which the 
family is instituted than that which ordinarily prevails 
among those classes which take the lead in forming the 
customs of society. The aim will be to exhibit modes of 
economizing labor, time, and expenses, so as to secure 
health, thrift, and domestic happiness to persons of limited 
means, in a measure rarely attained even by those who 
possess wealth. 

At the head of this chapter is a sketch of what may be 
properly called a Christian house ; that is, a house con- 
trived for the express purpose of enabling every member 
of a family to labor with the hands for the common good, 
and by modes at once healthful, economical, and tasteful 

Of course, much of the instruction conveyed in the fol 
lowing pages is chiefly applicable to the wants and habits 
of those living either in the country or in such suburban 
vicinities as give space of ground for healthful outdoor 
occupation in the family service, although the general 
principles of house-building and house-keeping are of ne- 
cessity universal in their application — as true in the busy 
confines of the city as in the freer and purer quietude of 
the country. So far as circumstances can be made to 
yield the opportunity, it will be assumed that the family 
state demands some outdoor labor for all. The cultiva- 
tion of flowers to ornament the table and house, of fruits 
and vegetables for food, of silk and cotton for clothing, 
and the care of horse, cow, and dairy, can be so divided 
that each and all of the family, some part of the day, 
can take exercise in the pure air, under the magnetic and 
healthful rays of the sun. Every head of a family should 
seek a soil and climate which will afford such opportuni-

ties. Railroads, enabling men toiling in cities to rear 
families in the country, are on this account a special bless- 
ing. So, also, is the opening of the South to free labor, 
where, in the pure and mild climate of the uplands, open- 
air labor can proceed most of the year, and women and 
children labor out of doors as well as w; thin. 

In the following drawings ai'e presented modes of econ- 
omizing time, labor, and expense by the close packing of 
conveniences. By such methods, small and economical 
houses can be made to secure most of the comforts and 
many of the refinements of large and expensive ones. 
The cottage at the head of this chapter is projected on a 
plan which can be adapted to a warm or cold climate with 
little change. By adding another story, it would serve a 
large family. 

Fig. 1 shows the ground-plan of the first fioor. On the 
inside it is forty-three feet long and twenty-five wide, ex- 
cluding conservatories and front and back projections. Its 
inside height from floor to ceiling is ten feet. The piazzas 
each side of the front projection have sliding-windows to 
the floor, and can, by glazed sashes, be made green-houses 
in winter. In a warm climate, piazzas can be made at the 
back side also. 

In the description and arrangement, the leading aim is 
to show how time, labor, and expense are saved, not only 
in the building but in furniture and its arrangement. 
"With this aim, the ground-floor and its furniture will first 
be shown, then the second story and its farniture, and 
then the basement and its conveniences. The conserva- 
tories are appendages not necessary to housekeeping, but 
useful in many ways pointed out more at large in other 
chapters. 

The entry has arched recesses behind the front doors, 
(Fig. 2,) furnished with hooks for over-clothes in both — a 
box for over-shoes in one, and a stand for umbrellas in the 
other. The roof of the recess is for statuettes, busts, or

a recess at the lower landing, where a table is set with a 
, vase of flowers, (Fig. 3.) On one side 
of the recess is a closet, arched to cor- 
respond with the arch over the stairs. 
A bracket over the first broad stair, 
with flowers or statuettes, is visible 
from the entrance, and pictures can 
be hung as in the illustration. 

The large room on the left can be 
made to serve the purpose of several 
rooms by means of a movable screen. 
By shifting this rolling screen from one 
part of the room to another, two apart- 
ments are alwaj's available, of any de- 
sired size within the limits of the large

toward the part of the room used as the bedroom. On 
one side, and at the top and bottom, it has shelves with 
shelf-toxes, which are cheaper and better than drawers, 
and much preferred by those using them. Handles are 
cut in the front and back side, as seen in Fig. 6. Half an 
inch space must be between the box and the shelf over it, 
and as much each side, so that it can be taken out and 
put in easily. The central part of the screen's interior is 
a wardrobe.

ceiling, in order to prevent it from overturning. It is 'to

The inside of these doors is furnished with hooks for cloth- 
ing, for which the projection makes room. The whole 
screen is to be eighteen inches deep at the top and two 

feet deep at the base, giving a 
solid foundation. It is moved 
on four wooden rollers, one 
foot long and four inches in 
diameter. The pivots of the 
rollers and the parts where 
there is friction must be rubbed with hard soap, and then 
a child can move the whole easily.

in three parts, with lead or large nails in the hems to 
keep it in place. The wood- work must be put together 
with screws, as the screen is too large to pass through a 
door. 

At the end of the room, behind the screen, are two 
couches, to be run one under the other, as in Fig. 7. The

a notched two-inch board, three inches wide, as in Fig. 8.

turned. They must not be fastened at the ends, except 
by insertion in the notches. Across the posts, and of equal 
height with them, are to be screwed head and foot-boards.

frame should be as near the floor as possible, resting on 
the casters. 

The most healthful and comfortable mattress is made 

by a case, open in 
the centre and 
fastened together 
with buttons, as 
in Fig. 9 ; to be 
filled with oat 
straw, which is softer than wheat or rye. This can be 
adjusted to the figure, and often renewed.

the under couch put beneath it. The coverlid should 
match the curtain of the screen ; and the pillows, by day, 
should have a case of the same.

inside. The cushion to be cut square, with side pieces ; 
stuffed with hair, and stitched through like a mattress. 
Side handles are made by cords fastened inside with knots. 
The box must be two inches larger at the bottom than 
at the top, and the lid and cushion the same size as the 
bottom, to give it a tasteful shape. This ottoman is set 
on casters, and is a great convenience for holding articles, 
while serving also as a seat. 



32 THE EOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

The exponse of the screen, where lumber averages $4 a 
hundi-ed, and carpenter labor $3 a day, would be about 
$30, and the two couches about $6. The material for 
covering might be cheap and yet pretty. A woman w'th 
these directions, and a son or husband who would use plane 
and saw, could thus secure much additional room, and 
also what amounts to two bureaus, two large trunks, one 
large wardrobe, and a wash-stand, for less than $20 — the 
mere cost of materials. The screen and couches can be 
so arranged as to have one room serve first as a large and 
airy sleeping-room ; then, in the morning, it may be used 
as sitting-room one side of the screen, and breakfast-room 
the other ; and lastly, through the day it can be made a 
large parlor on the front side, and a sewing or retiring- 
room the other side. The needless spaces usually devoted 
to kitchen, entries, halls, back-stairs, pantries, store-rooms, 
and closets, by this method would be used in adding to 
the size of the large room, so variously used by day and 
by night. 

Fig. 12 is an enlarged plan of the kitchen and stove- 
room. The chimney and stove-room are contrived to 
ventilate the whole house, by a mode exhibited in another 
chapter. 

Between the two rooms glazed sliding-doors, passing 
each other, serve to shut out heat and smells from the 
kitchen. The sides of the stove-roorn must be lined with 
shelves ; those on the side by the cellar stairs, to be one 
foot wide, and eighteen inches apart ; on the other side, 
shelves may be narrower, eight inches wide and nine 
inches apart. Boxes with lids, to receive stove utensils, 
must be placed near the stove. 

On these shelves, and in the closet and boxes, can be 
placed every material used for cooking, all the table and 
cooking utensils, and all the articles used in house work, 
and yet much spare room will be left. The cook's galley 
Jn a steamship has every article and utensH used in cook-

ing for two hundred persons, in a space not larger than 
this stove-room, and so arranged that with one or two 
steps the cook can reach all he uses. 

In contrast to this, in most large houses, the table 
furniture, the cooking materials and utensils, the sink, and 
the eating-room, are at such distances apart, that half the 
time and strength is employed in walking back and forth 
to collect and return the articles used.

at the bottom, while the light is better adjusted for worlc- 
ing, in case of weak eyes. 

The flour-barrel just fills the closet, which has a door 
for admission, and a lid to raise when used. 13eside it, is 
the form for cooking, with a moulding-board laid on it ; 
one side used for preparing vegetables and meat, and the 
other for moulding bread. The sink has two pumps, for 
well and for rain-water — one having a forcing power to 
throw water into the reservoir in the garret, which sup- 
plies the water-closet and bath-room. On the other side 
of the sink is the dish-drainer, with a ledge on the edge 
next the sink, to hold the dishes-, and grooves cut to let 
the water drain into the sink. It has hinges, so that it 
can either rest on the cook-form or be turned over and 
cover the sink. Under the sink are shelf-boxes placed on 
two shelves run into grooves, with other grooves above 
and below, so that one may move the shelves and increase 
or diminish the spaces between. The shelf-boxes can be 
used for scouring-materials, dish-towels, and dish-cloths; 
also to hold bowls for bits of butter, fats, etc. Under 
these two shelves is room for two pails, and a jar for 
soap-grease. 

Under the cook-form are shelves and shelf-boxes for un- 
bolted wheat, corn-meal, rye, etc. Beneath these, for 
white and brown sugar, are wooden can-pails, which are 
the best articles in which to keep these constant neces- 
sities. Eeside them is the tin molasses-can with a tight, 
movable cover, and a cork in the spout. This is much 
better than a jug for molasses, and also for vinegar and 
oil, being easier to clean and to handle. Other articles 
and implements for cooking can be arranged on or under 
the shelves at the side and front. _, _

The water-closets must have the latest improvements 
for safe discharge, and there will be no trouble. They 
cost no more than an out-door building, and save from the 
most disagreeable house-labor. 

A great improvement, called ea/rth-closets, will probably 
take the place of water-closets to some extent ; though at 
present the water is the more convenient. A description of 
the earth-closet will be giveu in another chapter relating to 
tenement-houses for the poor in large cities. 

The method of ventilating all the chambers, and also 
the cellar, will be desci'ibed in another chapter. 

Fig. 19 represents a shoe-bag, 
that can be fastened to the side 
of a closet or closet-door. 

Fig. 20 represents a piece-bag, 
and is a very great labor and space- 
saving invention. It is made of 
calico, and fastened to the side of 
a closefr or a door, to hold all the 
bundles that are usually stowed 
in trunks and drawers. India- 
rubber or elastic tape drawn into 
hems to hold the contents of the 
bag is better than tape-strings. 
Each bag should be labeled with 
the name of its contents, written 

with indelible ink on white tape sewed on to the bag. 
Such systematic arrangement saves much time and'annoy- 
ance. Drawers or trunks to hold these articles can not be 
kept so easily in good order, and moreover, occupy spaces 
saved by this contrivance. 

Fig. 21 is the basement. It has the floor and sides plas- 
tered, and is lighted with glazed doors. A form is raised 
close by the cellar stairs, for baskets, pails, and tubs.

Here, also, tlie refrigerator can be placed, or, what is 
better, an ice-closet can be made, as designated in the 
illustration. The floor of the basement must be an in- 
clined plane toward a drain, and be plastered with water- 
lime. The wash-tubs have plugs in the bottom to let ofi" 
water, and cocks and pipes over them bringing cold water 
from the reservoir in the garret and hot water from the 
laundry stove. This saves much heavy labor of emptying 
tubs and carrying water. 

The laundry closet has a stove for heating irons, and 
also a kettle on top for heating water. Slides or clothes-

frames are made to draw out to receive wet clothes, and 
then run into the closet to dry. This saves health as well 
as time and money, and the clothes are as white as when 
di-ied outdoors. 

The wood-work of the house, for doors, windows, etc., 
should be oiled chestnut, butternut, whitewood, and pine. 
This is cheaper, handsomer, and more easy to keep clean 
than painted wood. 

In Fig. 1 are planned two conservatories, and few under- 
stand their value in the training of the young. They pro- 
vide soil, in which children, through the winter months, 
can be starting seeds and plants for their gardens and rais- 
ing valuable, tender plants. Every child should cultivate 
flowers and fruits to sell and to give away, and thus be 
taught to learn the value of money and to practice both 
economy and benevolence. 

According to the calculation of a house-carpenter, in a 
place where the a/vertige price of lumber is $4 a hundred, 
and carpenter work $3 a day, such a house can be built 
for $1600. For those practicing the closest economy, two 
small families could occupy it, by dividing the kitchen, 
and yet have room enough. Or one large room and the 
chainber over it can be left till increase of family and 
means require enlargement. 

A strong horse and carryall, with a cow, garden, vine- 
yard, and orchard, on a few acres, would secure all the 
substantial comforts found in great establishments, with- 
out the trouble of ill-qualified servants. ^ 

And if the parents and- children were united in the 
daily labors of the house, garden, and fruit culture, such 
thrift, health, and happiness would be secured as is but 
rarely found among the rich. 

Let us suppose a colony of cultivated and Christian peo- 
ple, having abundant wealth, who now are living as the 
wealthy usually do, emigrating to some of the beauti-

mountains as picturesque as those of New-England, where 
the thermometer but rarely reaches 90° in summer, and 
in winter as rarely sinks below freezing-point, so that out 
door labor goes on all the year, where the fertile soil is 
easily worked, where rich tropical fruits and flowers 
abound, where cotton and silk can be raised by children 
around their home, where the produce of vineyards and 
orchards finds steady markets by railroads ready made; 
suppose such a colony, with a central church and school- 
room, library, hall for sports, and a common laundry, (tak- 
ing the most trying part of domestic labor from each 
house,) — suppose each family to train the children to 
labor with the hands as a healthful and honorable duty ; 
suppose all this, which is perfectly practicable, would not 
the enjoyment of this life be increased, and also abundant 
treasures be laid up in heaven, by using the wealth thus 
economized in diffusing similar enjoyments and culture 
among the poor, ignorant, and neglected ones in desolated 
sections where many now are perishing for want of Bucb 
Christian example and influences ?

A HEAlTHFUl HOME. 

When " the wise woman buildeth her house," the first 
consideration will be the health of the inmates. The 
first and most indispensable requisite for health is pure 
air, both by day and night. 

If the parents of a family should daily withhold from 
their children a large portion of food needful to growth. 
and health, and every night should administer to each a 
small dose of poison, it would be called murder of the 
most hideous character. But it is probable that more 
than one half of this nation are doing that very thing. 
The murderous operation is perpetrated daily and nightly, 
in our parlors, our bed-rooms, our kitchens, our school- 
rooms ; and even our churches are no asylum from the 
barbarity. N'or can we escape by our railroads, for even 
there the same dreadful work is going on. 

The only palliating circumstance is the ignorance of 
those who commit these wholesale murders. As saith the 
Scripture, " The people do perish for lack of knowledge." 
And it is this lack of knowledge which it is woman's 
special business to supply, in first training her household 
to intelligence as the indispensable road to virtue and 
happiness. 

The above statements will be illustrated by some ac- 
count of the manner in which the body is supplied with 
healthful nutriment. There are two modes of nourishing 
the body, one is by fpod and the other by air. In the 



44 



TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 



Fig. a 



stomach the food is dissolved, and the nutritious portion 
is absorbed by the blood, and then is carried by blood- 
vessels to the lungs, where it receives oxygen from the 
air we breathe. This oxygen is as necessary to the nourish- 
ment of the body as the food for the stomach. In a full- 
grown man weighing one hundred and fifty-four pounds, 
one hundred and eleven poxmds consists of oxygen, ob- 
tained chiefly from the air we breathe. Thus the lungs 
feed the body with oxygen, as really as the stomach sup- 
plies the other food required. 

The lungs occupy the upper 
portion of the body from the 
collar-bone to the lower ribs, 
and between their two lobes is 
placed the heart. 

Fig. 22 shows the position of 
the lungs, though not the exact 
shape. On the right hand is 
the exterior of one of the lobes, 
and on the left hand are seen 
the branching tubes of the in- 
terior, through which the air 
we breathe passes to the ex- 
ceedingly minute air-cells of 
which the lungs chiefly consist. 
Fig. 23 shows the outside of a 
cluster of these air-cells, and

of each air-cell is

several tmndred times, appear in the microscope as at Fig. 
25. Every air-cell has a blood-vessel that brings blood 
fi'om the heart, 
^' ■ which meanders 

through its capil- 
laries till it reach- 
es another blood- 
vessel that carries 
it back to the 
heart, as seen in 
Fig. 26. In this 
passage of the blood through these 
capillaries, the air in the air-cell im- 
parts its oxygen to the blood, and re- 
ceives in exchange carbonic acid and 
watery vapor. These latter are expir- 
ed at every breath into the atmo- 
sphere. 

By calculating the number of air 
cells in a small portion of the lungs, under a miscroscope, 
it is ascertained that there are no less than eighteen mil- 
lion of these wonderful little purifiers and feeders of the 
body. By their ceaseless ministries, every grown person 
receives, each day, thirty-three hogsheads of air into the 
lungs to nourish and vitalize every part of the body, and 
also to carry off its impurities. 

But the heart has a most important agency in this 
operation. Fig. 27 is a diagram of the heart, which is 
placed between the two lobes of the lungs. The right 
side of the heart receives the dark and impure blood, 
which is loaded with carbonic acid. It is brought from 
every point of the body by branching veins that unite in 
the upper and the lower vena cava, which discharge into 
the right side of the heart. This impure blood passes to 
the capillaries of the air-cells in the lungs, where it gives 
off carbonic acid, and, taking oxygen from the air, then 




46 



THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 



returns to the left side of the heart, from whence it is sent 
out through the aorta and its myriad branching arteries 
to every part of the body. 

AORTA When the up- 

per portion of the 
heart contracts, it 
forces both the 
pure blood from 
the lungs, and 
the impure blood 
from the body, 
thr o ugh th e 
valves marked Y, 
V, into the lower 
part. When the 
lower portion 
contracts, it closes 
the valves and 
forces the impure 
blood into the 
lungs on one side, and also on the other side forces the 
purified blood through the aorta and arteries to all parts 
of the body. 

As before stated, the lungs consist chiefly of air-cells, 
the walls of which are lined with minute blood-vessels j 
and we know that in every man these air-cells number 
eighteen millions. 

ITow every beat of the heart sends two ounces of blood 
into the minute, hair-like blood-vessels, called capillaries, 
that line these air-cells, where the air in the air-cells gives 
its oxygen to the blood, and in its place receives carbonic 
acid. This gas is then expired by the lungs into the sur- 
rounding atmosphere. 

Thus, by this powerful little organ, the heart, no less 
than twenty-eight pounds of blood, in a common-sized

giving out carbonic acid and watery vapor, and receiving 
the life-inspiring oxygen. 

Whether all this blood shall convey the nourishing and 
invigorating oxygen to every part of the body, or return 
unrelieved of carbonic acid, depends entirely on the pure- 
ness of the atmosphere that is breathed. 

Every time we think or feel, this mental action dissolves 
some particles of the brain and nerves, which pass into 
the blood to be thrown out of the body through the liingB 
and skin. In like manner, whenever we move any muscle, 
some of its particles decay and pass away. It is in the 
capillaries, which are all over the body, that this change 
takes place. The blood-vessels that convey the pure blood 
from the heart, divide into myriads of little branches that 
terminate in capillary vessels like those lining the air-cells 
of the lungs. The blood meanders through these minute 
capillaries, depositing the oxygen taken from the lungs 
and the food of the stomach, and receiving in return the 
decayed matter, which is chiefly carbonic acid. 

This carbonic acid is formed by the union of oxygen 
with carbon or cha/rcoal, which forms a large portion of 
the body. "Watery vapor is also formed in the capillaries 
by the union of oxygen with the hydrogen contained in 
the food and drink that nourish the body. 

During this process in the capillaries, the bright red 
blood of the arteries changes to the purple blood of the 
veins, which is carried back tO|the heart, to be sent to the 
lungs as before described. A portion of the oxygen re- 
ceived in the lungs unites with the dissolved food sent 
from the stomach into the blood, and no food can not rish 
the body tUl it has received a proper supply of oxygen in 
the lungs. At every breath a half-pint of blood receives 
its needed oxygen in the lungs, and at the same time gives 
out an equal amount of carbonic acid and water. 

Kow, this carbonic acid, if received into the lungs, 
andiluted by sufficient air, is a fatal poison, causing 



48 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

certain death. When it is mixed with only a small por- 
tion of air, it is a slow poison, which imperceptibly under- 
mines the constitution. 

We now can understand how it is that all who live in 
houses where the breathing of inmates has deprived the 
air of oxygen, and loaded it with carbonic acid, may truly 
be said to be poisoned and starved ; -poisoned with carbonic 
acid, and starved for want of oxygen. 

Whenever oxygen unites with carbon to form carbonic 
acid, or with hydrogen to form water, heat is generated 
Thus it is that a kind of combustion is constantly going 
on in the capillaries all over the body. It is this burning 
of the decaying portions of the body that causes animal 
heat. It is a process similar to that which takes place 
when lamps and candles are burning. The oil and tallow, 
which are chiefly carbon and hydrogen, unite with the 
oxygen of the air and form carbonic acid and watery 
vapor, producing heat during the process. So in the ca- 
pillaries all over the body, the carbon and hydrogen sup- 
plied to the blood by the stomach, unite with the oxygen 
gained in the lungs, and cause the heat which is diffused 
all over the body. 

The skin also performs an office, similar to that of the 
lungs. In the skin of every adult there are no less than 
seven million minute perspirating tubes, each one fourth 
of an inch long. If all these were united in one length, 
they would extend twenty-eight miles. These minute 
tubes are lined with capillary blood-vessels, which are 
constantly sending out not only carbonic acid, but . other 
gases and particles of decayed matter. The skin and 
lungs together, in one day and night, throw out three 
quarters of a pound of charcoal as carbonic acid, beside 
Qther gases and water. 

While the bodies of men and animals are filling the 
air with the poisonous carbonic acid, and using up the 
.life-giving oxygen, the trees and plants are performing an 



A HEALTHFUL HOME. 49 

exactly contrary process ; for they are absorbing carbonic 
acid and giving out oxygen. Thus, by a wonderful 
arrangenient of the beneficent Creator, a constant equi- 
librium is preserved. What animals use is provided by 
vegetables, and what vegetables require is furnished by 
animals ; and all goes on, day and night, without care or 
thought of man. 

The human race in its infancy was placed in a mild 
and genial clime, where each separate family dweit in 
tents, and breathed, both day and night, the pure air of 
heaven. And when they became scattered abroad to 
colder climes, the open fire-place secured a full supply of 
pure air. But civilization has increased economies and 
conveniences far ahead of the knowledge needed by the 
common people for their healthful use. Tight sleeping- 
rooms, and close, air-tight stoves, are now starving and poi- 
soning more than one half of this nation. It seems im- 
possible to make people know their danger. And the 
remedy for this is the light of knowledge and intelligence 
which it is woman's special mission to bestow, as she con- 
trols and regulates the ministries of a home. 

The poisoning process is thus exhibited in Mrs. Stowe's 
" House and Home Papers," and can not be recalled too 
often : 

" ISTo other gift of God, so precious, so inspiring, is treat- 
ed with si^ch utter irreverence and contempt in the calcu- 
lations of us mortals as this same air of heaven. A ser- 
mon on oxygen, if we had a preacher who understood the 
subject, might do more to repress sin than the most, ortho- 
dox discourse to show when and how and why sin came. 
A minister gets up in a crowded lecture-room, where the 
mephitic air almost makes the candles burn blue, and be- 
wails the deadness of the church — the church the while, 
drugged by the poisoned air, growing sleepier and sleepier, 
though they feel dreadfully wicked for being so. 

" Little Jim, who, fresh from his afternoon's ramble in

the fields, last evening said his prayers dutifully, and lay 
down to sleep in a most Christian frame, this morning sits 
up in bed with his hair bristling with crossness, strikes at 
his nurse, and declares he won't say his prayers — that he 
don't want to be good. The simple difference is, that the 
child, having slept in a close box of a room, his brain all 
night fed by poison, is in a mild state of moral insanity. 
Delicate women remark that it takes them till eleven or 
twelve o'clock to get up their strength in the morning. 
Query, Do they sleep with closed windows and doors, and 
with heavy bed-curtains ? 

" The houses built by our ancestors were better ventila- 
ted in certain respects than modern ones, with all their 
improvements. The great central chimney, with its open 
fire-places in the different rooms, created a constant cur- 
rent which carried off foul and vitiated air. In these 
days, how common is it to provide rooms with only a flue 
for a stove ! This flue is kept shut in summer, and in win- 
ter opened only to admit a close stove, which burns away 
the vital portion of the air quite as fast as the occupants 
breathe it away. The sealing up of flre-places and intro- 
duction of air-tight stoves may, doubtless, be a saving of 
fael ; it saves, too, more than that ; in thousands and thou- 
sands of cases it has saved people from all further human 
wants, and put an end forever to any needs short of the 
six feet of narrow earth which are man's only inalienable 
property. In other words, since the invention of air-tight 
stoves, thousands have died of slow poison. 

" It is a terrible thing to reflect upon, that our northern 
winters last from November to May, six long months, in 
which many families co:ifine themselves to one room, of 
which every window-crack has been carefully calked to 
make it air-tight, where an air-tight stove keeps the atmo- 
sphere at a temperature between eighty and ninety ; and 
the inmates, sitting there with all their winter clothes on, 
become enervated both by the heat and by the poisoned 



A BBALTSFUL HOME. 51 

air, for which there is no escape but the occasional open- 
ing of a door. 

" It is no wonder that the first result of all this is such 
a delicacy of skin and lungs that about half the inmates 
are obliged to give up going into the open air diu-ing the 
six cold months, because they invariably catch cold if they 
do so. It is no wonder that the cold caught about the first 
of Deceniber has by the first of March b'ecome a fixed con- 
sumption, and that the opening of the spring, which ought 
to bring life and health, in so many cases brings death. 

" "We hear of the lean condition in which the poor bears 
emerge from their six months' wintering, during which 
they subsist on the fat which they have acquired the pre- 
vious summer. Even so, in our long winters, multitudes 
of deUcate people subsist on the daily waning strength 
which they acquired in the season when windows and 
doors were open, and fresh air was a constant luxury. No 
wonder we hear of spring fever and spring biliousness, and 
have thousands of nostrums for clearing the blood in the 
spring. All these things are the pantings and palpita 
tions of a system run down under slow poison, unable to 
get a step further. 

"Better, far better, the old houses of the olden time, 
with their great roaring fires, and their bed-rooms where 
the snow came in and the wintry winds whistled. Then, 
to be sure, you froze your back while you burned your

congealed in ice-wreaths on the blankets, and you could

in tlirough the window-cracks. But you woke full of life 
- and vigor, you looked out into the whirling snow-storms 
without a shiver, and thought nothing of plunging through 
drifts as high as your head on your daily way t6 school.

like a snow-bird, and your blood coursed and tingled, in

none of the slow-creeping, black blood wbicli clogs the 
brain and lies like a weight on the vital wheels !" 

To illustrate the effects of this poison, the horrors of 
"the Black Hole of Calcutta" a^e often referred to, 
where one hundi-ed and forty-six men were crowded into 
a room only eighteen feet square with but two small win- 
dows, and in a hot climate. After a night of such horri- 
ble torments as chill the blood to read, the morning 
showed a pUe of one hundred and twenty-three dead men 
and twenty-three half dead that were finally recovered 
only to a life of weakness and suffering. 

In another case, a captain of the steamer Londonderry, 
in 1848, from sheer ignorance of the consequences, in a 
storm, shut up his passengers in a tight room without win- 
dows. The agonies, groans, curses, and shrieks that fol- 
lowed were horrible. The struggling mass finally burst 
the door, and the captain found seventy-two of the two 
hundred already dead; while others, with blood starting 
from their eyes and ears, and their bodies in convulsions, 
were restored, many only to a life of sickness and de- 
bility. 

It is ascertained by experiments that breathing bad 
air tends so to reduce all the processes of the body, that 
less oxygen is demanded and less carbonic acid sent out. 
This, of course, lessens the vitality and weakens the con- 
stitution ; and it accounts for the fact that a person of full 
health, accustomed to pure air, suffers from bad air far 
more than those who are accustomed to it. The body of 
strong and healthy persons demands more oxygen, and 
throws off more carbonic acid, and is distressed when the 
supply fails. But the one reduced by bad air feels little 
inconvenience, because all the functions of life are so slow 
that less oxygen is needed, and less carbonic acid thrown 
out. And the sensibilities being deadened, the evil is not 
felt. This provision of nature prolongs many lives, though 
it turns vigorous constitutions into feeble ones. Were it 



A BEALTSFTTL SOME. 53 

not for this change in the constitution, thousands in badly 
ventilated rooms and houses would come to a speedy death. 

One of the results of unventilated rooms is scrofula. A 
distinguished French physician, M. Baudeloque, states that : 

" The repeated respiration of the same atmosphere is 
t?ie cause of scrofula. If there be entirely pure air, there 
may be bad food, bad clothing, and want of personal clean- 
liness, but scrofulous disease can not exist. This disease 
never attacks persons who pass their lives in the open air, 
and always manifests itself when they abide in air which 
is unrenewed. Inva/riahly it will be found that a trii.y 
scrofulous disease is caused by vitiated air ; and it is not 
necessary that there should be a prolonged stay in such 
an atmosphere. Often, several hours each day is suffi- 
cient. Thus persons may live in the most healthy coun- 
try, pass most of the day in the open air, and yet become 
scrofulous by sleeping in a close room where the air is not 
renewed. This is the case with many shepherds who pass 
their nights in small huts with no opening but a door 
closed tight at night." 

The same writer illustrates this by the history of a 
French village where the inhabitants all slept in close, un- 
ventilated houses. Nearly all were seized with scrofula, 
and many families became wholly extinct, their last mem- 
bers dying "rotten with scrofula." A fire destroyed a 
large part of this village. Houses were then built to 
secure pure- air, and scrofnla disappeared from the part 
thus rebuilt. 

"We are informed by medical writers that defecti^ve ven- 
tilation is one great cause of diseased joints, as well as of 
diseases of the eyes, ears, and skin. 

Foul air is the leading cause of tubercular and scrofu- 
lous consumption, so very common in our country. Dr. 
Guy, in his examination before public health commission- 
ers in Great Britain, says : " Deficient ventilation I believe 
to be more fatal than all other causes put together." He 



54 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

states tliiit consumption is twice as common among trades- 
men as among the gentry, owing to the bad ventilation of 
their stores and dwellings. 

Dr. Griscom, in his work on Uses and Abuses of Air, 
says : 

" Food carried from the stomach to the blood can not be- 
come nutritive till it is properly oxygenated in the lungs ; 
so that a small quantity of food, even if less wholesome, 
may be made nutritive by pure air as it passes through 
the lungs. But the best of food can not be changed into 
nutritive blood till it is vitalized by pure air in the lungs." 

And again : 

" To thpse who have the care and instruction of the ris- 
ing generation — the fature fathers and mothers of men — 
this subject of ventilation commends itself with an inter- 
est surpassing every other. Nothing can more convincing- 
ly establish the belief in ,the existence of something vital- 
ly wrong in the habits and circumstances of civilized life 
than the appalling fact that onefov/rth of all who are born 
die before reaching the fifth year, and one half the deaths 
of mankind occur under the twentieth year. Let those 
who have these things in charge answer to their own con- 
sciences how they discharge their duty in supplying to the 
young a pv/re atmosphere, which is the first requisite for 
healthy iodies and sound minds.'''' 

On the subject of infant mortality the experience of sav- 
ages should teach the more civilized. Professor Brewer, 
who traveled extensively among the Indians of our western 
territories, states : " I have rarely seen a sick boy among 
the Indians." Catlin, the painter, who resided and traveled 
so much among these people, states that infant mortality is 
very small among them, the reason, of course, being abun- 
dant exercise and pure air. 

Ur. Dio Lewis, whose labors in the cause of health are 
well known, in his very usefal work, 'Weak Jjwngs, ana 
How to MaJce them Strong, says : 



A HMALTBFXJL SOME. 66 

" As a medical man I have visited thousands of sick- 
rooms, and have not found in one in a hvm,dred of them 
a pure atmosphere. I have often returned from church 
doubting whether I had not committed a sin in exposing 
myself so long to its poisonous air. There are in our great 
cities chm-ches costing $50,000, in the construction of which 
not fifty cents were expended in providing means for ven- 
tilation. Ten thousand dollars for ornament, but not ten 
cents for pure air ! 

" TJnventilated parlors, with gas-burners, (each consum- 
ing as much oxygen as several men,) made as tight as pos- 
sible, and a party of ladies and gentlemen spending half 
the night in them! In 1861, I visited a legislative hall, 
the legislature being in session. I remained half an hour 
in the most impure air I ever breathed. Our school-houses 
are, some of them, so vile in this respect, that I would pre- 
fer to have my son remain in utter ignorance of books 
rather than to breathe, six hours every day, such a poison- 
ous atmosphere. Theatres tod concert-rooms are so foul 
that only reckless people continue to visit them. Twelve 
hours in a railway-car exhausts one, not by the journeying, 
but because of the devitalized air. "While crossing the 
ocean in a Cunard steamer, I was amazed that men who 
knew enough to construct such ships did not know enough 
to furnish air to the passengers. The distress of sea-sick- 
ness is greatly intensified by the sickening air of the ship. 
Were carbonic acid only hlach, what a contrast there would 
be between our hotels in their elaborate ornament ! 

" Some time since I visited an establishment where one 
1 iiundred and fifty girls, in a single room, were engaged in 
needle-work. Pale-faced, and with low vitality and feeble 
circulation, they were unconscious that they were breath- 
ing air that at once produced in me dizziness and a sense 
of sufibcation. If I had remained a week with them, I 
should, by reduced vitality, have become unconscious of 
the vileness of the air !" 



-56 TEE BOUSEKEEPBR'8 MANUAL. 

There is a prevailing prejudice against night air as un- 
healthfii- to be admitted into sleeping-rooms, wMcli is 
owing wliolly to sheer ignorance. In the night every 
body necessarily breathes night air and no other. When 
admitted from without into a sleeping-room it is colder, 
and therefore heavier, than the air within, so it , sinks to 
the bottom of the room and forces out an equal quantity 
of the impure air, warmed and vitiated by passing through 
the lungs of inmates. Thus the question is. Shall we shut 
up a chamber and breathe night air vitiated with carbonic 
acid or night air that is pure ? The only real difficulty 
about night air is, that usually it is damper, and therefore 
colder and more likely to chill. This is easily prevented 
by sufficient bed-clothing. 

One other very prevalent mistake is found even in books 
written by learned men. It is often thought that carbonic 
acid, being heavier than common air, sinks to the floor of 
sleeping-rooms, so that the low trundle-beds for children 
should not be used. This is all a mistake ; for, as a fact, in 
close sleeping-rooms the purest air is below and the most im- 
pure above. It is true that carbonic acid is heavier than com- 
mon air, when pure ; but this it rarely is except in chemical 
experiments. It is the property of all gases, as well as of 
the two (oxygen and nitrogen) composing the atmosphere, 
that when brought together they always are entirely mixed^ 
each being equally dififused exactly as it would be if alone. 
Thus the carbonic acid from the skin and lungs, being 
warmed in the body, rises as does the common air, with 
which it mixes, toward the top of a room ; so that usually 
there is more carbonic acid at the L/p than at the bottom of 
a room.* Both common air and carbonic acid expand and 
become lighter in the same proportions ; that ia,, for every 



* Prof. Brewer, of the Yale Scientific School, says: "As a fact, often 
demonstrated by analysis, there is generally more carbonic acid npa'' thp 
ceiling than near the floor." 



A BEALTBFUL SOME. 57 

degree of added heat they expand at the rate of ,1, of 
their bulk. 

Here, let it be remembered, that in ill-ventilated rooms 
the carbonic acid is not the only cause of disease. Experi- 
ments seem to prove that other matter thrown out of the 
body, through the limgs and skin, is as truly excrement and 
in a state of decay as that ejected from the bowels, and as 
poisonous to the animal system. Carbonic acid has no 
odor; but we are warned by the disagreeable effluvia of 
close sleeping-rooms of the other poison thus thrown into 
the air from the skin and lungs. There is one provision of 
nature that is little understood, which saves the lives of 
thousands living in unventilated houses; and that is, the 
passage of pure air inward and impure air outward through 
the pores of bricks, wood, stone, and mortar. "Were such 
dwellings changed to tin, which is not thus porous, in less 
than a week thousands and tens of thousands would be in 
danger of peri^ng by suffocation. 

These statements give some idea of the evils to be reme- 
died. But the most difficult point is how to secure the 
remedy. Tor often the attempt to secure pure air by one 
class of persons brings chills, colds, and disease on another 
class, from mere ignorance or mismanagement. 

To illustrate this, it must be borne in mind that those 
who live in warm, close, and unventilated rooms are much 
more liable to take cold from exposure to draughts and 
cold air than those of vigorous vitality' accustomed to 
breathe pure air. 

Thus the strong and healthy husband, feeling the want 
of pure air in the night, and knowing its importance, keeps 
windows open and makes such draughts that the wife, who 
lives all day in a close room and thus is low in vitality, can 
not bear the change, has colds, and sometimes perishes a 
victim to wrong modes of veiitilation. 

So, even in health-establishments, the patients will pass 
most of their days and nights in badly-ventilated rooms. 



68 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

But at times the physician, or some earnest patient, insists 
on a mode of ventilation that brings more evil than good 
to the delicate inmates. 

The grand art of ventilating houses is by some method 
that will empty rooms of the vitiated air and bring in a 
supply of pure air iy small and imperceptible currents. 

But this important duty of a Christian woman is one 
that demands more science, care, and attention than 
almost any other; and yet, to prepare her for this duty 
has never been any part of female education. Young 
women are taught to draw mathematical diagrams and to 
solve astronomical problems ; but few, if any, of them are 
taught to solve the problem of a house constructed to se- 
cure pure and moist air by day and night for all its inmates. 

The heating and management of the air we breathe is 
one of the most complicated problems of domestic econo- 
my, as will be farther illustrated in the succeeding chap- 
ter; and yet it is one of which most American women 
are profoundly ignorant. 



IV. 

SOrENTIFIO DOMESTIC VENTHiATIOlT. 

We have seen in the preceding pages the process through 
which the air is rendered nnhealthM by close rooms and 
want of ventilation. Every person inspires air about twenty 
times each minute, using half a pint each time. At this 
rate, every pair of lungs vititates one hogshead of air every 
hour. The membrane that lines the multitudinous air-cells 
of the lungs in which the capillaries are, should it be united 
in one sheet, would cover the floor of a room twelve 
feet square. Every breath brings a surface of air in contact 
with this extent of capillaries, by which the air inspired 
gives up most of its oxygen and receives carbonic acid in 
its stead. These facts furnish a guide for the proper venti- 
lation of rooms. Just in proportion to the number of per- 
sons in a room or a house, should be the amotmt of air 
brought in and carried out by arrangements for ventilation. 
But how rarely is this rule regarded in building houses or 
in the care of families by housekeepers ! 

The evils resulting from the substitution of stoves in- 
stead of the open fireplace, have led scientific and benevo- 
lent men to contrive various modes of supplying pure air 
to both public and private houses. But as yet little has 
been accomplished, except for a few of the more iatelligent 
and wealthy. The great majority of the American people, 
owing to sheer ignorance, are, for want of pure air, being 
poisoned and starved ; the result being weakened constitu- 
tions, frequent disease, and shortened life. 



{JO THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

"Whenever a family-room is heated by an open fire, it is 
duly ventilated, as the impure air is constantly passing off 
through the chimney, while, to supply the vacated space, 
the pure air presses in through the cracks of doors, win- 
dows, and floors. No such supply is gained for rooms 
warmed by stoves. And yet, from mistaken motives of 
economy, as well as from ignorance of the resulting evils, 
multitudes of householders are thus destroying health and 
shortening life, especially in regard to women and children 
who spend most of their time within-doors. 

The most successful rdodes of making " a healthfal home " 
by a full supply of pure air to every inmate, will now be 
described and illustrated. 

It is the common property of both air and water to ex- 
pand, become lighter and rise, just in proportion as they 
are heated ; and therefore it is the invariable law that cool 
air sinks, thus replacing the warmer air below. Thus, 
whenever cool air enters a warm room, it sinks downward 
and takes the place of an equal amount of the warmer air, 
which is constantly tending upward and outward. This 
principle of all fluids is illustrated by the following experi- 
ment : 

Take a glass jar about a foot high and three inches in 
diameter, and with a wire to aid in placing it aright, sink 
a small bit of lighted candle so as to stand in the centre at 
the bottom. (Fig. 28.) The candle will heat the air of the 
jar, which, will rise a little on one side, while the colder air 
without will begin falling on the other side. Thesu two 
currents will so conflict as finally to cease, and then the 
candle, having no supply of oxygen from fresh air, will be- 
gin to go out. Insert a bit of stiff paper so as to divide 
tlie mouth of the jar, and instantly the cold and warm air 
are not in conflict as before, because a current is formed 
each side of the paper ; the cold air descending on one side 
and the warm air ascending the other side, as indicated by 
the arrows. As long as the paper remains, the candle will

bum, and as booh as it is removed, it will begin to go out, 

and can be restored by again insertiug tbe paper. 

This illustrates tbe mode by which coal-mines are venti- 
Fig. 28. lated when filled with carbonic 

acid. A shaft divided into two 
passages, (Fig. 29,) is let down 
into the mine, where the air is 
warmer than the outside air. 
Immediately the colder air outside 
presses down into the mine, through 
the passage which is highest, being 
admitted by the escape of an equal 
piantity of the 
warmer air, 
which rises 
through the low- 
er passage of the 
shaft, this being 
the first availa- 
ble opening for 
it to rise through. 
A current is thus 
created, which 

continues as long as the inside air is 

warmer than that without the mine, 

and no longer. Sometunes a fire is 

kindled in the mine, in order to con- 
tinue or increase the warmth, and 

consequent i^pward current of its air. 
This illustrates one oi the cases 

where a " wise woman that huildeth 

her house" is greatly needed. For, 

owing to the ignorance of architects, 

house-builders, and men in general, 

they have been building school- 

liouses, dwelling-houses, churches,

and colleges, with the most absurd and senseless contriv- 
ances for ventilation, and all from not applying this simple 
principle of science. On this point. Prof. Brewer, of the 
Scientific School of Yale College, wi'ites thus : 

" I have been in public buildings, (I have one in mind 
now, filled with dormitories,) which cost half a million, 
where they attempted to ventilate every room by a flue, long 
and narrow, built into partition walls, and extending up into 
tJie capacious garret of the fifth story. Every room in the 
building had one such flue, with an opening into it at the 
floor and at the ceiling. It is needless to say that the 
whole concern was entirely useless. Had these flues been 
of proper proportions, and properly divided, the desii-ed 
ventilation would have been secured." 

And this piece of ignorant folly was perpetrated in the 
midst of learned professors, teaching the laws of fluids and 
the laws of health. 

A learned physician also thus wrote to the author of 
this chapter : " The subject of the ventilation of our dwell- 
ing-houses is one of the most important questions of our 
times. How many thousands are victims to a slow suicide 
and murder, the chief instrument of which is want of ven- 
tilation ! How few are aware of the fact that every person, 
every day, vitiates thirty-three hogsheads of the air, and 
that each inspiration takes one fifth of the oxygen, and 
returns as much carbonic acid, from every pair of lungs in 
a room ! How few understand that after air has received 
ten per cent of this fatal gas, if drawn into the lungs, it

wonder there is so much impaired nervous and muscular 
energy, so much scrofula, tubercles, catarrhs, dyspepsia, 
and typhoid diseases. I hope you can do r^uch to remedy 
the poisonous air of thousands and thousands of stove- 
heated rooms." 

In a cold climate and wintry weather, the grand im- 
pediment to ventilating rooms by opening doors or wir

dows is the dangerous currents thus produced, which are 
so injurious to the delicate ones that for their sake it can 
not he done. Then, also, as a matter of economy, the 
poor can not afford to practice a method which carries 
off the heat generated by their stinted store of fuel. 
Even in a warm season and climate, there are frequent 
periods when the air without is damp and chilly, and yet 
at nearly the same temperature as that in the house. At 
such times, the opening of windows often has little effect 
in emptying a room of vitiated air. The ventilating-flues, 
such as are used in mines, have, in such cases, but little 
influence ; for it is only when outside air is colder that a 
current can be produced within by this method. 

The most successful mode of ventilating a house is by 
creating a current of warm air in a flue, into which an 
opening is made at both the top and the bottom of a room, 
while a similar opening for outside air is made at the op- 
posite side of the room. This is the mode employed in che- 
mical laboratories for removing smells and injurious gases. 

The laboratorv-closet is closed with glazed doors, and has 
an opening to receive pure air through a conductor from 
without. The stove or furnace within has a pipe which joins 
a larger cast-iron chimney-pipe, which is warmed by the 
smoke it receives from this and other fires. This cast-iron 
pipe is surrounded by a brick flue, through which air passes 
from below to be warmed by the pipe, and thus an upward 
current of warm air is created. Openings are then made 
at the top and bottom of the laboratory-closet into the warm- 
air flue, and the gases and smells are pressed by the colder 
air into this flue, and are carried off in the current of warm air. 

The same method is employed in the dwelling-house 
shown in a preceding chapter. A cast-iron pipe is made 
in sections, which are to be united, and the whole fastened 
at top and bottom in the centre of the warm-air flue by 
ears extending to the bricks, and fastened when the flue is 
in process of building. Projecting openings to receive the 



64 



THE HOVSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 



Fig. 80. 



pipes of the furnace, the laundry stove, and two stoves in 
each story, should be provided, which must be closed when 
not in use. A large opening is to be made into the warm- 
air flue, and through this the kitchen stove-pipe is to pass, 
and be joined to the cast-iron chimney-pipe. Thus the 
smoke of the kitchen stove will warm the iron chimney- 
pipe, and this will warm the air of the flue, causing a cm-- 
rent upward, and this current will draw the heat and smells 

of cooking out of the kitchen 
into the opening of the warm- 
air flue. Every room sur- 
rounding the chimney has an 
opening at the top and bottom 
into the warm-air flue for ven- 
tilation, as also have the bath- 
room and water-closets. 

The writer has examined 
the methods most employed 
at the present time, which are 
all modifications of the two 
modes here described. One 
is that of Robinson, patented 
by a Boston company, which 
is a modification of the min- 
ing mode. It consists of the 
two ventilating tubes, such as 
are employed in mines, united 
in one shaft with a roof to 
keep out rain, and a valve to 
regulate the entrance and exit 
of air, as illustrated in Fig. 
30. This method works well 
in certain circumstances, but 
fails so often as to prove very unreliable. A^other mode 
is that of Ruttan, which is eflected by heating air. This 
also has certain advantages and disadvantages. But the 




SCIENTIFIC DOMESTIC VENTILATION. 66 

mode adopted for the preceding cottage plan is free from 
the difficulties of both the above methods, while it will 
BTirely ventilate every room in the house, both by day and 
night, and at all seasons, without any risk to health, and re- 
quiring no attention or care from the family. 

By means of a very small amount of fuel in the kitchen 
stove, to be described hereafter, the whole house can be 
ventilated, and all the cooking done both in warm and cold 
\reather. This stove will also warm the whole house, in the 
Northern States, eight or nine months in the year. Two 
Franklin stoves, in addition, vdll warm the whole house 
during the three or four remaining coldest months. 

In a warm climate or season, by means of the non-con- 
ducting castings, the stove will ventilate the house and do 
all the cooking, without imparting heat or smells to any 
part of the house except the stove-closet. 

At the close of this volume, drawings, prepared by Mr. 
Lewis Leeds, are given, more fully to illustrate this mode 
of warming and ventilation, and in so plain and simple a 
form that any intelligent woman who has read this work 
can see that the plan is properly executed, even with work- 
men so entirely ignorant on this important subject as are 
most house-builders, especially in the newer territories. In 
the same article, directions are given as to the best modes 
of ventilating houses that are already built without any 
arrangements for ventilation.

THE OONSTEtrOTION AND CASE OF 8T0TES, FXIRNA0K8, AND 
OHIMNETS. 

If all American housekeevers could be taught how to 
select and manage the most economical and convenient 
apparatus for cooking and for warming a house, many 
miUions now wasted by ignorance and neglect would be 
saved. Every woman should be taught the scientific prin- 
ciples in regard to heat, and then their application to prac- 
tical purposes, for her own benefit, and also to enable her 
to train her children and servants in this important duty 
of homo life on which health and comfort so much de- 
pend. 

The laws that regulate the generation, diffusion, and pre- 
servation of heat as yet are a sealed mystery to thousands 
of young women who imagine they are completing a suit- 
able education in courses of instruction from which most 
that is practical in future domestic life is wholly excluded, 
We therefore give a brief outline of some of the leading 
scientific principles which every housekeeper should un 
derstand and employ, in order to perform successfully one 
of her most important duties. 

Concerning the essential nature of heat, and its intimate 
relations with the other great natural forces, light, electri- 
city, etc., we shall not attempt to treat, but sliall, for prac- 
tical purposes, assume it to be a separate and independent 
force. 

Heat or caloric, then, has certain powers or principles. 
Let us consider them : 



STOVJSS, FURNACES, AND CHIMNEYS. Q't 

First, we find Conduction, by which heat passes from one 
particle to anotlier next to it; as when one iend of a poker 
is warmed by placing the other end in the fire. The bodies 
which allow this power free course are called conductors, 
and those which do not are named non-conductors. Metals 
are good conductors ; feathers, wool, and furs are poor con- 
ductors ; and water, air, and gases are non-conductors. 

Another principle of heat is Convection, by which water, 
air, and gases are warmed. This is, literally, the process 
of conveying heat fi-om one portion of a fluid body to an- 
other by currents resulting from changes of temperature. 
It is secured by bringing one portion of a liquid or gas 
into contact with a heated surface, whereby it becomes 
lighter and expanded in volume. In consequence, the 
cooler and heavier particles above pressing downward, 
the lighter ones rise upward, when the former, being 
heated, rise in their turn, and give place to others again 
descending from above. Thus a constant motion of cur- 
rents and interchange of particles is produced until, as in 
a vessel of water, the whole body comes to an equal tem- 
perature. Air is heated in the same way. In case of a 
hot stove, the air that touches it is heated, becomes lighter, 
and rises, giving place to cooler and heavier particles, 
which, when heated, also ascend. It is owing to this pro- 
cess that the air of a room is warmest at the top and coolest 
at the bottom. 

It is owing to this principle, also, that water and air 
can not be heated by fire from above. For the particles 
of these bodies, being non-conductors, do not impart heat 
to each other ; and when the warmest are at the top, they 
can not take the place of cooler and heavier ones below. 

Another principle of heat (which it shares with light) is 
Badiation, by which all things send out heat to surround- 
ing cooler bodies. Some bodies will absorb radiated heat, 
others will reflect it, and others allow it to pass through 
them without either absorbing or reflecting Thus, black 



68 



THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL.

and rough substances absorb beat, (or light,) colored and 
smooth articles reflect it, wMle air allows it to pass through 
without either absorbing or reflecting. It is owing to this, 
that rough and black vessels boil water sooner than smooth 
and light-colored ones. 

Another principle is Befledion, by which heat radiated 
to a surface is turned back from it when not absorbed or 
allowed to pass through ; just as a ball rebounds from a 
wall ; just as sound is thrown back from a hill, making 
echo; just as rays of light are reflected from a mirror. 

And, as with light, the 
rays of heat are always 
reflected from a surface 
in an angle exactly cor- 
responding to the direc- 
tion in which it strikes 
that surface. Thus, if 

heated air comes to an 

object perpendicularly — 
that is, at right angles, it will be reflected back in the 
same line. If it strikes obliquely, it is reflected obliquely, 
at an angle with the sur- 
face precisely the same ^- ®" 
as the angle with which 
it first struck. And, of 
course, if it moves to- 
ward the surface and 
comes, upon it in a line 
having so small an angle 
with it as to be almost 

parallel with it, the heated air is spread wide and diffiised 

through a larger space 
than when the angles are 
greater and the width of 
reflection less. 
The simplest mode of warming a house and cooking food 




STOVES, FXJBNACES, AND CBIMNET8. 00 

is by radiated heat fi-ora fires ; but this is the most wasteful 
method, as respects time, labor, and expense. The mos^t con- 
venient, economical, and labor-saving mode of employing 
heat is by convection, as applied in stoves and furnaces. 
But for want of proper care and scientific knowledge this 
method has proved very destructive to health. When 
warming and cooking were done by open fires, houses were 
well supplied with pure air, as is rarely the case in rooms 
heated by stoves. For such is the prevailing ignorance on 
this subject that, as long as stoves save labor and warm the 
air, the great majoi-ity of people, especially among the 
poor, will use them in ways that involve debilitated con- 
stitutions and frequent disease. 

The most common modes of cooking, where open fires 
are relinquished, are by the range and the cooking-stove. 
The range is inferior to the stove in these respects : it is 
less economical, demanding much more fuel ; it endangers 
the dress of the cook while standing near for various ope- 
rations; it requires more stooping than the stove while 
cooking ; it will not keep a fire all night, as do the best 
stoves ; it will not burn wood and coal equally well ; and 
lastly, if it warms the kitchen sufficiently in winter, it is 
too warm for summer. Some prefer it because the fumes 
of cooking can be carried off; but stoves properly arranged 
accomplish this equally well. 

After extensive inquiry and many personal experiments, 
the author has found a cooking-stove constructed on true 
scientific principles, which unites convenience, comfort, and 
economy in a remarkable manner. Of this stove, drawings 
and descriptions will now be given, as the best mode of 
illustrating the practical applications of these principles to 
the art of cooking, and to show how much American wo- 
men have sufiered and how much they have been imposed 
upon for want of proper knowledge in this branch of theii 
profession. And every woman can understand what fol- 
lows with much less efibrt than young girls at high-schools

much as the abstract reasonings of Algebra and Geometry.

A 




Fig. 34 represents a portion of the interior of this cook- 
ing-stove. First, notice the fire-box, which has corrugated ' 
(literally, wrinkled) sides, by which space is economized, 
so that as much heating surface is secured as if they were 
one third larger ; as the heat radiates from every part of 
the undulating surface, which is one third greater in super- 
ficial extent than if it were plane. The shape of the fire- 
box also secures more heat by having oblique sides — 
which radiate more effectively into the oven beneath than 
if they were perpendicular, as illustrated below — while 
also it is sunk into the oven, so as to radiate from three 
instead of from two sides, as in most other stoves, the

which separates the oven from the bottom of the stove. 
The top of the oven is the horizontal corrugated plate 
passing from the rear edge of the fire-box to the back flues. 
These are three in number — the back centre-flue, which 
is closed to the heat and smoke coming over the oven from 
the fire-box by a damper — and the two back corner-flues. 
Down these two corner-flues passes the current of hot air 
and smoke, having first drawn across the corrugated oven- 
top. The arrows show its descent through these flues, 
from which it obliquely strikes and passes over the flue- 
plate, then under it, and then out through the centre back- 
flue, which is open at the bottom, up into the smoke-pipe. 

The flue-plate is placed obliquely, to accumulate heat by 
forcing and compression ; for the back space where the 
smoke enters from the corner-flues is largest, and decreases 
toward the front, so that the hot current is compressed in a 
narrow space, between the oven-bottom and the flue-plate 
at the place where the bent arrows are seen. Here again 
it enters a wider space, under the flue-plate, and proceeds 
to another narrow one, between the flue-plate and the 
bottom of the stove, and thus is compressed and re- 
tained longer than if not impeded by these various con- 
trivances. The heat and smoke also strike the plate 
obliquely, and thus, by reflection from its surface, impart 
more heat than if the passage was a horizontal one. 

The external radiation is regulated by the use of non-

conducting plaster applied to the flue-plate and to the sides 
of the corner-flues, so that the heat is prevented from radi- 
ating in any direction except toward the oven. The doors, 
sides, and bottom of the stove are lined with tin casings,, 
which hold a stratum of air, also a non-conductor. These are 
so arranged as to be removed whenever the weather becomes 
cold, so that the heat may then radiate into the kitchen. 
Tlie outer edges of the oven are also sunilarly protected from 
loss of heat by tin casings and air-spaces, and the oven-doors 
opening at the front of the store are provided with the same 
economical savers of heat. High tin covers placed on the 
top prevent the heat from radiating above the stove. 
These are exceedingly useful, as the space under them is 
well heated and arranged for baking, for heating irons, 
and many other incidental necessities. Cake and pies can 
be baked on the top, while the oven is used for bread or 
for meats. When all the casings and covers are on, almost 
all the heat is confined within the stove, and whenever 
heat for the room is wanted, opening the front oven-doors 
turns it out into the kitchen. 

Another contrivance is that of ventilating-holes in the 
front doors,' through which fresh , air is brought into the 
oven. This secures several purposes : it carries off the 
fumes of cooking meats, and prevents the mixing of flavors 
when different articles are cooked in the oven ; it drives 
the heat that accumulates between the fire-box and front 
doors down around the oven, and equalizes its heat, so that 
articles need not be moved while baking ; and lastly, as 
the air passes through the holes of the fire-box, it causes 
the burning of gases in the smoke, and thus increases heat. 
When wood or bituminous coal is used, perforated metal 
linings are put in the fire-box, and the result is the burn- 
ing of smoke and gases that otherwise would pass into the 
chimney. This is a great discovery in the economy of 
fuel, which can be applied in many ways. 

Heretofore, most cooking-stoves have had dumping-grates, 



STOVUS, FUKNACES, AND CHIJIAETS. 73 

wliieli are inconvenient from the dust prodneod, are uneco- 
nomical in the use of fuel, and disadvantageous from too 
many or too loose joints. But recently this stove has been 
provided with a dumping-grate which also will sift ashes, 
and can be cleaned without dust and the other objection- 
able features of dumping-grates. A further account of this 
Btove, and the mode of purchasing and using it, will be 
given at the close of the book. 

Those who are taught to manage the stove properly 
keep the fire going all night, and equally well with wood 
or coal, thus saving the expense of kindling and the trouble 
of starting a new fire. When the fuel is of good quality, 
all that is needed in the morning is to draw the back- 
damper, shake the grate, and add more fuel. 

Another remarkable feature of this stove is the extension- 
top, on which is placed a water reservoir, constantly heated 
by the smoke as it passes from the stove, thi-ough one or two 
uniting passages, to the smoke-pipe. Under this is placed 
a closet for warming and keeping hot the dishes, vegetables, 
meats, etc., while preparing for dinner. It is also very 
useful in drying fruit ; and when large baking is required, 
a small appended pot for charcoal turns it into a fine large 
oven, that bakes as nicely as a brick oven. 

Another useful appendage is a common tin oven, in 
which roasting can be done in front of the stove, the oven- 
doors being removed for the purpose. The roast will be 
done as perfectly as by an open fire. 

This stove is furnislied with pipes for heating water, like 
the water-back of ranges, and these can be taken or left 
out at pleasure. So also the top covers, the baking-stool 
and pot, and the summer-back, bottom, and side-casingt* 
can be used or omitted as preferred. 

Fig. 37 exhibits the stove completed, with all its appen- 
dages, as they might be employed in cooking for a large 
number. 

Its capacity, convenience, and economy as a stove may

be estimated by the following fact : WitK proper manage- 
ment of dampers, one ordinary-sized coal-hod of anthracite 
coal will, for twenty-four hours, keep the stove running, 
keep seventeen gallons of water hot at aU hours, bake pies

and puddings in the warm closet, heat flat-irons under the 
back cover, boil tea-kettle and one pot under the front 
cover, bake bread ia the oven, and cook a turkey in the 
tin roaster in trout. The author has numerous friends, 
who, after trying the best ranges, have dismissed them for 
this stove, and in two or three years cleared the whole ex- 
pense by the saving of fuel. ^ 

The remarkable durability of this stove is another eco- 
nomic feature. For in addition to its fine castings and 



STOVES, FUBNACES, AND . OHIMNET8. 75 

nice-fitting workmanship, all the parts liable to burn out 
are so protected by linings, and other contrivances easily 
renewed, that the stove itself may pass from one genera- 
tion to another, as do ordinary cliiumeys. The writer has 
visited in families where this stove had been in constant 
use for eighteen and twenty years, and was still as good as 
new. In most other families the stoves are broken, bnrnt- 
ont, or thrown aside for improved patterns every four, 
five, or six years, and sometimes, to the knowledge of the 
wi'iter, still oftener. 

Another excellent point is that, although it is so com- 
plicated in its various contrivances as to demand intelli- 
gent management in order to secure all its advantages, it 
also can be used satisfactorily even when the mistress and 
maid are equally careless and ignorant of its distinctive 
merits. To such it offers all the advantages of ordinary 
good stoves, and is extensively used by those who take no 
pains to understand and apply its peculiar advantages. 

But the writer has managed the stove herself in all the 
details of cooking, and is confident that any housekeeper 
of common sense, who is instructed properly, and who also 
aims to have her kitchen affairs managed with strict eco- 
nomy, can easily train any servant who is willing to learn, 
80 as to gain the full advantages offered. And even with- 
out any instructions at all, except the printed directions 
sent with the stove, ah intelligent woman can, by due 
attention, though not without, both manage it, and teach 
her children and servants to do likewise. And whenever 
this stove has failed to give the highest satisfaction, it has 
been, either because the housekeeper was not apprized of 
its peculiarities, or because she did not give suflicient 
attention to the matter, or was not able or willing to super- 
intend and direct its management. 

The consequence has been that, in families where this 
stove has been understood and managed aright, it has 
saved nearly one half of the fuel that would be used in ordi-

nary stoves, constructed with the usual disregard of scien- 
tific and economic laws. And it is because we know this 
particular stove to be convenient, reliable, and economi- 
cally efficient beyond ordinary experience, in the important 
housekeeping element of kitchen labor, that we devote to 
it so much space and pains to describe its advantageous 
points. 

OHIttNEYS. 

One of the most serious evils in domestic life is often 
found in chimneys that will not properly draw the smoke 
of a fire or stove. Although chimneys have been building 
for a thousand years, the artisans of the present day seem 
strangely ignorant of the true method of constructing them 
so as always to carry smoke upward instead of downward. 
It is rarely the case that a large house is built in which 
there is not some flue or chimney which " will not draw." 
One of the reasons why the stove described as excelling all 
others is sometimes cast aside for a poorer one is, that it 
requires a properly constructed chimney, and multitudes 
of women do not know how to secure it. The writer in 
early life shed many a bitter tear, drawn forth by smoke 
from an ill-constructed kitchen-chimney, and thousands 
all over the land can report the same experience. 

The following are some of the causes and the remedies 
for this evil. 

The most common cause of poor chimney draughts is too 
large an opening for the fireplace, either too wide or too 
high in front, or having too large a throat for the smoke. 
In a lower story, the fireplace should not be larger than 
thirty inches wide, twenty-five inches high, and fifteen deep. 
In the story above, it should be eighteen inches square and 
fifteen inches deep. 

Another cause is too short a flue, and the remedy is to 
lengthen it. As a general rule, the longer the flue the 
stronger the draught. But in calculating the length of a 



STOVES, FURNACES, AND CSIMNETS. 71 

flue, reference must be "had to side-flues, if any open into it. 
Where this is the case, the length of the main flue is to be 
considered as extending only from the bottom to the point 
where the apper flue joins it, and where the lower will 
receive air from the upper flue. If a smoky flue can not 
be increased in length, either by closiag an upper flue or 
lengthening the chimney, the fireplace must be contracted 
80 that all the air near the fire will be heated and thus 
pressed upward. 

If a flue has more than one opening, in some cases it is 
impossible to seciu-e a good draught. Sometimes it will 
work well and sometimes it will not. The only safe rule is 
to have a separate flue to each flre. 

Another cause of poor draughts is too tight a room, so 
that the cold air from without can not enter to press the 
warm air up the chimney. The remedy is to admit a small 
current of air from without. 

Another cause is two chimneys in one room, or ia rooms 
opening together, ia which the draught in one is much 
stronger than in the other. In this case, the stronger 
draught wiU draw away from the weaker. The remedy is, 
for each room to have a proper supply of outside air ; or, 
in a single room, to stop one of the chimneys. 

Another cause is the too close vicinity of a hill or build- 
ings higher than the top of the chimney, and the remedy 
for this is to raise the chimney. 

Another cause is the descent, into unused fireplaces, of 
smoke from other chimneys near. The remedy is to close 
the throat of the unused chimney. 

Another cause is a door opening toward the fireplace, 
on the same side of the room, so that its draught passes 
along the wall and makes a current that- draws out the 
smoke. The remedy is to change the hanging of the door 
so as to open another way. 

Another cause is strong winds. The remedy is a turn- 
cap on top of the chimney. 



78 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Anotlier cause is the roughness of the inside of a chim- 
ney, or projections which impede the passage of the smoke. 
Every cliimney should be built of equal dimensions from 
bottom to top, with no projections into it, with as few benda 
as possible, and with the surface of the inside as smooth 
as possible. 

Another cause of poor draughts is openings into the 
chimney of chambers for stove-pipes. The remedy is to 
(jlose them, or insert stove-pipes that are in use. 

Another cause is the falling out of brick in some part of 
the chimney so that outer air is admitted. The remedy is 
to close the opening. 

The draught of a stove may be affected by most of these 
causes. It also demands that the fireplace have a tight 
fire-board, or that the throat be carefully filled. For neg- 
lecting this, many a good stove has been thrown aside and 
a poor one taken in its place. 

If all young women had committed to memory these 
causes of evil and their remedies, many a badly-built chim- 
ney might have been cured, .and many smoke-drawn tears, 
sighs, ill-tempers, and irritating words avoided. 

But there are dangers in this direction which demand 
special attention. Where one flue has two stoves or fire- 
places, in rooms one above the other, in certain states of the 
atmosphere, the lower room, being the warmer, the cold^ 
air and carbonic acid in the room above will pass down into 
the lower room through the opening for the stove or the 
fireplace. 

This occurred not long since in a boarding-school, when 
the gas in a room above flowed into a lower one, and suffo- 
cated several to death. This room had no mode of venti- 
lation, and several persons slept in it, and were thus sti- 
fled. Professor Brewer states a similar case in the family 
of a relative. An anthracite stove was used in the upper 
room ; and on one still, dose night, the gas from this stove 
descended through the flue and the opening into a room below 



STOVES, FUBNACE8, AND CHIMNEYS. 79 

and stifled two persons to insensibility, though, by proper 
efforts, their lives were saved. Many such cases have oc- 
c;;irred where rooms have been thus filled with poisonous 
gases, and servants and children destroyed, or their consti- 
tutions injured, simply because housekeepers are not pro- 
perly instructed in this important branch of their profession. 

FXTEITACES. 

There is no improved mechanism in the economy of 
domestic life requiring more intelligent management than 
furnaces. Let us then consider some of the principles in- 
volved. 

The earth is heated by radiation from the sun. The air 
is not warmed by the passage of the sun's heat through it, 
but by convection from the earth, in the same way that it 
is warmed by the surfaces of stoves. The lower stratum 
of air is warmed by the earth and by objects which have 
been warmed by radiated heat from the sun. The par- 
ticles of air thus heated expand, become lighter, and rise, 
being replaced by the descent of the cooler and heavier 
particles from above, which, on being warmed also rise, 
and give place to others. Owing to this process, the air 
is warmest nearest the earth, and grows cooler as height 
increases. 

The air has a strong attraction for water, and always 
holds a certain quantity as invisible vapor. The warmer 
the air, the more moisture it demands, and it will draw it 
from all objects within reach. The air holds water accord- 
ing to its temperature. Thus, at fifty-two 'egrees, Fah- 
renheit's thermometer, it holds half the moisture it can 
sustain ; but at thirty-six degrees, it will hold only one 
eighty-sixth part. The earth and all plants and trees are 
constantly sending out moisture ; and when the air has re- 
ceived all it can hold, without depositing it as dew, it is 
said to be satv/rated, and the point of temperature at which 



80 TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

dew begins to form, by condensation, upon tbe surface 
of the earth and its vegetation, is called the dew-poimt. 
When air, at a given temperature, has only forty per cent 
of the moisture it requires for saturation, it is said to be 
dry. In a hot summer day, the air wiU hold far more 
moisture than in cool days. In summer, out-door air 
rarely holds less than half its volume of water. In 1838, 
at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and New-Haven, Connecti- 
cut, at seventy degrees, Fahrenheit, the air held eighty per 
cent of moisture. 

In New-Orleans, the air often retains ninety per cent of 
the moisture it is capable of holding ; and in cool days at 
the North, in foggy weather, the air is sometimes wholly 
saturated. 

When air holds all the moisture it can, without deposit- 
ing dew, its moisture is called 100. When it holds three 
fourths of this, it is said to be at seventy-five per cent. 
When it holds only one half, it is at fifty per cent. When 
it holds only one fourth, it is at twenty-five per 
cent, etc. 

Sanitary observers teach that the proper amoimt of mois- 
ture iQ the air ranges from forty to seventy per cent of 
oaturation. 

Now, furnaces, which are of course used only in winter, 
receive outside air at a low temperature, holding little 
moisture ; and heating it greatly increases its demand for " 
moisture. This it sucks up, like a sponge, firom the walls 
and furniture of a house. If it is taken into the human 
lungs, it draws much of its required moisture from the body, 
often causing dryness of lips and throat, and painfdlly af- 
fecting the lungs. Prof. Brewer, of the Scientific School 
of New-Haven, who has experimented extensively on this 
subject, states that, while forty per cent of moisture is 
needed in air to make it healthful, most stoves and furnaces 
do not, by any contrivances, supply one half of this, or 
not twenty per cent. He says most furnace-heated air is 



STOVUS, FXmNACES, AND CBIMNETS. 81 

dryer than is ever breathed in the hottest deserts of Sa- 
hara. 

Thus, for want of proper instruction, most American 
■ housekeepers not only poison their families with carbonic 
acid aiid starve them for want of oxygen, but also diminish 
health and comfort for want of a due supply of moisture 
in the air. And often when a remedy is sought, by evapo- 
rating water in the furnace, it is without knowing that the 
amount evaporated depends, not on the quantity of water 
in the vessel, but on the extent of evaporating surface 
exposed to the air. A quart of water in a wide shallow 
pan will give more moisture than two gallons with a small 
surface exposed to heat. 

There is also no little wise economy in^expense attained 
by keeping a proper supply of moisture in the air. For 
it is found that the body radiates its heat less in moist 
than in dry air, so that a person feels as warm at a lower 
temperature when the air has a proper supply of moisture, 
as in a much higher temperature of dry air. Of course, 
less fael is needed to^ warm a house when water is evapo- 
rated in stove and furnace-heated rooms. It is said by those 
who have experimented, that the saving in fael is twenty 
per cent when the air is duly supplied with moisture. 

There is a very ingenious instrument, called the hygrb- 
deik, which indicates the exact amount of moisture in the 
air. It consists of two thermometers side by side, one of 
which has its bulb surrounded by floss-silk wrapping, which 
is kept constantly wet by conmiunication with a cup of 
water near it. The water around the bulb evaporates just 
in proportion to the heat of the air around it. The chang- 
ing of water to vapor draws heat from the nearest object, 
and this being the bulb of the thermometer, the mercury 
is cooled and sinks. Then the difference between th§ two 
thermometers shows the amount of moisture in the air by 
a pointer on a dial-plate constructed by simple mechanism 
for this purpose. 



82 TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

There is one very important matter in regard to the use 
of furnaces, which is thus stated by Professor Brewer : 

" I think it is a well-established fact that carbonic oxide 
will pass through iron. It is always formed in great abun- 
dance in any anthracite fire, but especially in anthracite 
stoves and furnaces. Moreover, furnaces always leak, more 
or less; how much they leak depending on the care and 
skill with which they are managed. Carbonic oxide is 
much more poisonous than carbonic acid. Doubtless some 
carbonic oxide finds its way into all furnace-heated houses, 
especially where anthracite is used; the amoimt varying 
with the kind of furnace and its management. As to how 
much escapes into a room, and its' specific effect upon the 
health of its occupants, we have no accurate data, no analy- 
sis to show the quantity, and no observati ns to show the 
relation between the quantity inhaled and the health of 
those exposed ; all is mere conjecture upon this point ; but 
the inference is very strong that it has a very injurious 
effect, producing headaches, weariness, and other similar 
symptoms. 

" Eecent pamphlets lay the blame of all the bad effects 
of anthracite furnaces and stoves to the carbonic oxide min- 
gled in the air. I think these pamphlets have a bad influ- 
ence. Excessvue dryness also has bad effects. So also the 
excessive heat in the evenings and coolness in the mornings 
has a share in these evils. But how much in addition iS 
owing to carbonic oxide, we can not know, until we know 
something of the actual amount of this gas in rooms, and 
as yet we know absolutely nothing definite. In fact, it will 
be a difficult thing io proved 

There are other difficulties connected with furnaces which 
should be considered. It is necessary to perfect health that 
an equal circulation of the blood be preserved. The great- 
est impediment to this is keeping the head warmer than the 
feet. This is especially to be avoided in a nation where the 
brain is by constant activity drawing the blood from the 



STOVUS, FUBNACES, AND CHIMNEYS. 83 

extremities. And nowhere is tliis more important than 
in schools, chm-ches, colleges, lectm-e and recitation-rooms, 
■where the 'brain is called into active exercise. And yet, 
fmnace-heatcd rooms always keep the feet in the coldest 
air, on cool floors, while the head is in the warmest air. 

Another difficulty is the fact that all bodies tend to radi- 
ate their heat to each other, till an equal temperature exists. 
Thus, the human body is constantly radiating its heat to 
the walls, floors, and cooler bodies ai'ound. At the same 
time, a thermometer is afiected in the same way, radiating 
its heat to cooler bodies around, so that it always marks a 
lower degree of heat than actually exists in the warm air 
around it. Owing to these facts, the injected air of a fur- 
nace is always wanner than is good for the lungs, and much 
warmer than is ever needed in rooms warmed by radiation 
from fires or heated surfaces. The cooler the air we inspire, 
the more oxygen is received, the faster the blood circulates, 
and the greater is the vigor imparted to brain, nerves, and 
muscles. 

Scientific men have been contriving various modes of 
meeting these difficulties, and at the close of this volume 
some results will be given to aid a woman in selecting and 
managins: the most healthful and economical furnace, or in 
providing some better method of warming a house. Some 
account will also be given of the danger involved in gas- 
stoves, and some other recent inventions for cpokiag and 
heating. 



VI. 

HOME DEOOKATION. 

Haying duly arranged for the physical necessities of a 
healthful and comfortable home, we next approach the 
important subject of leauty in reference to the deco- 
ration of houses. For while the aesthetic element must be 
subordinate to the requirements of physical existence, and, 
as a matter of expense, should be held of inferior con- 
sequence to means of higher moral growth ; it yet holds 
a place of great significance among the influences which 
make home happy and attractive, which give it a constant 
and wholesome power over the young, and contributes 
much to the education of the entire household in refine- 
ment, intellectual development, and moral sensibility. 

Here we are met by those who tell us that of course 
they want their houses handsome, and that, when they 
get money enough, they intend to have them so, but at 
present they are too poor, and because they are poor* 
they dismiss the subject altogether, and live without any 
regard to it. 

"We have often seen people who said that they could not 
afford to make their houses beautiful, who had spent upon 
them, outside pr in, an aanount of money which did not 
produce either beauty or comfort, and which, if judiciously 
applied, might have made the house quite charming. 

For example, a man, in building his house, takes a plan 
of an architect. This plan includes, on the outside, a 
number of what Andrew Fairservice called " curlywur- 



SOME DECORATION. 86 

lies" and. " wMgmaliries," which make the house neither 
prettier nor more comfortable, and which take up a good 
deal of money. We would venture to say that we could 
buy the chromo of Bierstadt's " Sunset in the Yo Semite 
VaUey," and four others like it, for half the sum that 
we have sometimes seen laid out on a very ugly, nar- 
row, awkward porch on the outside of a house. The 
only use of this porch was to cost money, and to caxise 
every body who looked at it to exclaim as they went by, 
"What ever induced that man to put a thing like that 
on the outside of his house ?" 

Then," again, in the inside of houses, we have seen a 
dwelliug looking very bald and bare, when a sufficient 
sum of money had been expended on one article to have 
made the whole very pretty : and it has come about in this 
way. 

We will suppose the couple who own the house to be in 
the condition in which people generally are after they 
have built a house — ^having spent more than they could 
afford on the building itself, and yet feeling themselves 
under the necessity of getting some furnitm'e. 

"Now," says the housewife, "I must at least have a 
parlor-carpet. We must get that to begin with, and other 
things as we go on." She goes to a store to look at carpets. 
The clerks are smiling and obliging, and sweetly compla- 
cent. The storekeeper, perhaps, is a neighbor or a Mend, 
and after exhibiting various patterns, he tells her of a 
Brussels carpet he is selling wonderfully cheap — actuaJy a 
dollar and a quarter less a yard than the usual price oi 
Brussels, and the reason is that it is an unfashionable pat- 
tern, "and he has a good deal of it, and wishes to close it off. 

She looks at it and thinks it is not at all the kind of car- 
pet she meant to buy, but then it is Brussels, and so cheap ' 
And as she hesitates, her friend tells her that she will find 
it " cheapest in the end — that one Brussels carpet will out- 
last three or four ingrains," etc., etc. 



86 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

The result of all this is, that she buys the Brussels carpet, 
which, -with all its reduction in price, is one third dearer 
than the ingrain would have been, and not half so pretty. 
WTien she comes home, she will find that she has spent, we 
will say eighty dollars, for a very homely carpet whose 
greatest merit it is an affliction to remember — namely, that 
it will outlast three ordinary carpets. And because she 
has bought this carpet she can not afford to paper the walls 
or put up any window-curtains, and cannot even begin to 
think of buying any pictures. 

Now let us see what eighty dollars could have done for 
that room. "We will suppose, in the first place, she invests 
in thirteen rolls of wall-paper of a lovely shade of buff, 
which will malfe the room look sunshiny in the day-time, 
and light up brilliantly in the evening. Thirteen rolls of 
good satin paper, at thirty-seven cents a roll, expends four 
dollars and eighty-one cents. A maroon bordering, made 
in imitation of the choicest French style, which can not at 
a distance be told from it, can be bought for six cents a 
yard. This will bring the paper to about five dollars and 
a half; and our friends will give a day of their time to 
putting it on. The room already begins to look furnished. 

Then, let us cover the floor with, say, thirty yards of 
good matting, at fifty cents a yard. This gives us a cairpet 
for fifteen dollars. We are here stopped by the prejudice 
that matting is not good economy, because it wears out so 
soon. We humbly submit that it is precisely the thing for 
a parlor, which is reserved for the reception-room of 
friends, and for our own dressed leisure hours. Matting is 
not good economy in a dining-room or a hard-worn sitting- 
room ; but such a parlor as we are describing is precisely 
the place where it answers to the very best advantage. 

We have in mind one very attractive parlor which has 
been, both for summer and winter, the daily sitting-room 
for the leisure hours of a husband and wife, and family 
of children, where a plain straw matting has done ser- 



SOME DECORATION. 87 

vice for seyen years. That parlor is in a city, and these 
friends are in the habit of receiving visits from people who 
live upon velvet and Brusssls ; but they prefer to spend the 
money which such carpets would cost on other modes of 
€mbelKshment ; and this parlor has often been cited to us 
as a very attractive room. 

And now om- friends, having got thus far, are requtested 
to select some one tint or color which shall be the prevail- 
ing one in the furniture of the room. Shall it be green ? 
Shall it be blue ? Shall it be crimson ? To carry on our 
illustration, we will choose green, and we proceed with it 
to create furniture for our room. Let us imagine that on 
one side of the fireplace there be, as there is often, a recess 
about six feet long and three feet deep. Fill this recess 
with a rough frame with four stout legs, one foot high, and 
upon the top of the frame have an elastic rack of slats. 
Make a mattress for this, or, if you wish to avoid that trou- 
ble, you can get a nice mattress for the sum of two dollars, 
made of cane-shavings or husks. Cover this with a green 
English furniture print. The glazed English comes at 
about twenty-five cents a yard, the glazed French at 
seventy-five cents a yard, and a nice article of yard-wide 
French twill (very strong) is from seventy-five to eighty 
cents a yard. 

With any of these cover your lounge. Make two large, 
square pillows of the same substance as the mattress, and 
set up at the back. If you happen to have one or two 
feather pillows that you can spare for the purpose, shake 
them down into a square shape and cover them with the 
same print, and you will then have four pillows for your 
lounge — one at each end, and two at the back, and you 
will find it answers for all the purposes of a sofa. 

It will be a very pretty thing, now, to cut out of the 
same material as your lounge, sets of lambrequins (or, as 
they are called, lamberJcins,) a kind of pendent curtain-top, 
as shown iu the illustration, to put over the windows, 



88 



THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 



which are to be embellished with white musHn curtains. 
The cornices to your windows can be simply strips of 
wood covered with paper to match the bordering of your 

room, and the 

Fig 38 1 -u ■ 

» ^ lambrequins, 

made of chintz 
like the lounge, 
can be trimmed 
with fringe or 
gimp of the same 
color. The pat- 
terns of these can 
be varied accord- 
ing to fancy, but 
simple designs 
are usually the 
prettiest. A tas- 
sel at the lowest 
point improves 
the appearance. 
The curtains 
can be made of 
plain white muslin, or some of the many styles that come for 
this purpose. If plain muslin is used, you can ornament 
them with hems an inch in width, in which insert a strip of 
gmgham or chambray of the same color as your chintz. 
This will wash with the curtains without losing its color, or 
should it fade, it can easily be drawn out and replaced. ' 

The influence of white-muslin curtains in giving an air 
of grace and elegance to a room is astonishing. White 
curtains really create a room out of nothing. No matter 
how coarse the muslin, so it be white and hang in graceful 
folds, there is a charm in it that supplies the want of mul- 
titudes of other things. 

Very pretty curtain-musHn can be bought at thirty- 
seven cents a yard. It requires six yards for a window.' 




SOME DECORATION. 



Let your men-folk knock up for you, out of rough, un- 
planed boards, some ottoman frames, as described in Chap- 
ter II. ; stuff the tops with just the same material as the 
lounge, and cover them with the self-same chintz. 

Now you 
have, sup- 
pose your 
selected 
color to 
be green, 
a green 
lounge in 
the corner 
and two 
green otto- 
mans; you 
have white 
muslin cur- 
tains, with 
green 1am- 
brequins 

and borders, and your room already looks furnished. 
If you have in the house any broken-down arm-chair, re- 
posing in the oblivion of the garret, draw it out — drive a 
nail here and there to hold it firm — stuff and pad, and 
stitch the padding through with a long upholsterer's nee- 
dle, and cover it with the chintz like your other furni- 
ture. Presto — you create ah easy-chair. 

Thus can broken and disgraced furniture reappear, and, 
being put into uniform with the general suit of your 
room, take a new lease of life. 

If you want a centre-table, consider this — ^that any kind 
of table, well concealed beneath the folds of handsome 
drapery, of a color coiTesponding to the general hue of the room, 
will look well. Instead of going to the cabinet-maker and 
paying from thirty to forty dollars upon a little, narrow,

cold, marble-topped stand, that gives just room enough to 
hold a lamp and a book or two, reflect within yourself 
what a centre-table is made for. If you have in your 
house a good, broad, generous-topped table, take it, cover 
it with an ample cloth of green broadcloth. Such a cover, 
two and a half yards square, of fine green broadcloth,, 
figured with black and with a pattern-border of grape- 
leaves, has been bought for ten dollars. In a room we wol 
of, it covers a dheap piae table, such as you may buy foi 
four or five dollars any day ; but you will be astonished 
to see how handsome an object this table makes under its 
green drapery. Probably you could make the cover more 
cheaply by getting the cloth and trimming its edge with a 
handsome border, selected for the purpose ; but either way, 
it will be an economical and useful ornament. "We set 
down our centre-table, therefore, as consisting mainly of a 
nice broadcloth cover, matching our curtains and lounge. 

We are sure that any one with " a heart that is hum- 
ble" may command such a centre-table and cloth for fif- 
teen dollars or less, and a family of five or six may all sit 
and work, or read, or write around it, and it is capable of 
entertaining a generous allowance of books and knick- 
knacks. 

Tou have now for your parlor the following figures : 

Wall-paper and border, $5 50 

Thirty yards matting, 15 00 

Centre-table and cloth, 15 00

Subtracted from eighty dollars, which we set down as 
the price of the cheap, ugly Brussels carpet, we have our 
whole room papered, carpeted, curtained, and furnished, 
and we have nearly twenty dollars remaining for pictures.

can wait for frames until you can afford them. Or, what 
is better, becaiise it is at once cheaper and a means of edu- 
cating the ingenuity and the taste, you can make for your- 
selves pretty rustic frames in various modes. Take a very 

thin board, of the right size and 
shape, for the foundation or

or rectangular form to suit the 
picture. Nail on the edge a rustic 
frame made of branches of hard, 
seasoned wood, and garnish the 
corners with some pretty device ; 
such, for instance, as a cluster of 
acorns ; or, in place of the branch- 
es of trees, fasten on with gluo 
small pine cones, with larger ones for corner ornaments. 
Or use the mosses of the wood or 
ocean shells for this purpose. It 
may be more convenient to get the 
mat or inner moulding from a 
framer, or have it made by your 
carpenter, with a groove behind to 
hold a glass. Here are also picture- 
frames of pretty effect, and very 
simply made. The one in Fig. 42

is made of either light or dark wood, neat, thin, and not 

very wide, with the ends simply- broken off, or cut so as to 

resemble a rough 
Fis-42- break. The other 

is white pine, sawn 
into simple form, 
well smoothed, and 
marked with a deli- 
cate black tracery, 
as suggested in Fig. 
43. This should 
also be varnished, 
then it will take a 
rich, yellow tinge, 
which harmonizes 
admirably with 
chromes, and light- 
ens up engravings 
to singular advan- 
tage. Besides the 

American and the higher range of German and Eng- 
lish chromos, there are very many pretty little French 

chromos, which can be had at 

prices from $1 to $5, including 

black walnut frames. 

We have been through this 

calculation merely to show our 

readers how much beautiful 

effect may be produced by a 

wise disposition of color and 

skill in arrangement. If any 

of our friends should ever carry 

it out, they will find that the 

buff paper, with its dark, narrow border ; the green chintz 

repeated in the lounge, the ottomans, and lambrequins; 

the flowing, white curtains; the broad, generous centre-

BOME DECORATION. 93 

table, draped with its ample green cloth, will, when ar- 
ranged together, produce an effect of grace and beauty 
far beyond what any one piece or even half a dozen pieces 
of expensive cabinet farniture could. The great, simple 
principle of beauty illustrated in this room is harmony of 
color. 

You can, in the same way, mate a red room by using 
Turkey red for your draperies ; or a blue room by using 
blue' chintz. Let your chintz be of a small pattern, and 
one that is decided in color. 

We have given the plan of a room with matting on the 
floor because that is absolutely the cheapest cover. The 
price of thirty yards plain, good ingrain carpet, at $1.50 
per yard, would be forty-five dollars; the difference be- 
tween forty-five and fifteen dollars would furnish a room 
with pictures such as we have instanced. However, the 
same programme can be even better carried out with a 
green ingrain carpet as the foundation of the color of the 
room. 

Our friends, who lived seven years upon matting, con- 
trived to give their parlor in winter an effect of warmth 
and color by laying down, in front of the fire, a large 
square of carpeting, say three breadths, four yards long. 
This covered the gathering-place around the fire where the 
winter circle generally sits, and gave an appearance of 
warmth to the room. 

If we add this piece of carpeting to the estimates for 
our room, we still leave a margin for a picture, and make 
tlie programme equally adapted to summer and winter. 

Besides the chromos, which, when well selected and of the 
host class, give the charm of color which belongs to expen- 
sive paintings, there are engravings which finely reproduce 
much of the real spirit and beauty of the celebrated pic- 
tures of the world. And even this does not exhaust the 
resources of economical art ; for there are few of the 
renowned statues, whether of antiquity or of modern times, 



94 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

that have not been accurately copied in plaster casts ; and 
a few statuettes, costing perhaps five or six dollars each, 
will give a really elegant finish to your rooms — providing 
always that they are selected with discrimination and 
taste. 

The educating influence of these works of art can hardly 
be over-estimated. Surrounded by such suggestions of the 
beautiful, and such reminders of history and art, children 
are constantly trained to correctness of taste and refine- 
ment of thought, and stimulated — sometimes to efforts at 
artistic imitation, always to the eager and intelligent in- 
quiry about the scenes, the places, the incidents represented. 

Just here, perhaps, we are met by some who grant all 
that we say on the subject of decoration by works of art, 
and who yet impatiently exclaim, " But I have no money 
to spare for any thing of this sort. I am condemned to an 
absolute bareness, and beauty in my case is not to be 
thought of" 

Are you sure, my friend ? If you live in the country, or 
can get into the country, and have your eyes opened and 
ybur wits about you, your house need not be condemned 
to an absolute bareness. Not so long as the woods are 
fiill of beautiful ferns and mosses, while every swamp 
shakes and nods with tremulous grasses, need you feel 
yourself aii utterly disinherited child of nature, and de- 
prived of its artistic use. 

For example : Take an old tin pan condemned to the 
retired list by reason of holes in the bottom, get twenty-five 
cents' worth of green paint for this and other purposes, and 
paint it. The holes in the bottom are a recommendation 
for its new service. If there are no holes, you must drill 
two or three, as drainage is essential. Now put a layer ■ 
one inch de^p of broken charcoal and potsherds over the 
bottom, and then soil, in the following proportions : 

Two fourths wood-soil, such as you find in forests, under 
trees. 



SOME DECORATION. 



95 



One fourth clean sand. 

One fourth meadow-soil, taken from under fresh turf. 
Mix with this some charcoal dust. 

In this soil plant all sorts of ferns, together with some 
few swamp-grasses ; and around the edge put a border of 
money-plant or periwinkle to hang over. This will need 
to be watered once or twice a week, and it will grow and 
thrive all summer long in a corner of your room. Should 
you prefer, you can suspend it by wires and make a hang- 
ing-basket. Ferns and wood-grasses need not have sun- 
shine — they grow well in shadowy places. 

On this same principle you can convert a salt-box or an 
old drum of figs into a hanging-basket. Tack bark and 
pine-cones and moss upon the outside of it, drill holes and 
pass wires through it, and you have a woodland hanging- 
basket, which will hang and grow in any corner of your 
house. 

"We have been into rooms which, by the simple disposi- 
tion of articles of this kind, have been made to have an air 

so poetical and attractive 
that they seemed more 
like a nymph's cave than 
any thing in the real 
world. 

Another mode of dispo- 
sing of ferns is this : Take 
a flat piece of board sawed 
out something like a 
shield, with a hole at the 
top for hanging it up. 

Upon the board nail a 
wire pocket made of an 
ox-muzzle flattened on 
one side; or make some- 
thing of the kind with stiff wire. Line this with a 
sheet of close moss, which appears green behind the wire 



rig. ^ 




96 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

net- work. Then you fill it with loose, spongy moss, such 
as you find in swamps, and plant therein great plumes 
of fern and various swamp-grasses ; they will continue to 
grow there, and hang gracefully over. When watering, 
set a pail under for it to drip into. It needs only to keep 
this moss always damp, and to sprinkle these ferns occa- 
sionaliy with a whisk-broom, to have a most lovely orna- 
ment for your room or hall. 

The use of ivy in decorating a room is beginning to be 
generally acknowledged. It needs to be planted in the 
kind of soil we have described, in a well-drained pot or 
box, and to have its leaves thoroughly washed once or 
twice a year in strong suds made with soft-soap, to. free it 
from dust and scale-bug ; and an ivy will live and thrive 
and wind about in a room, year in and year out, will grow 
around pictures, and do almost any thing to oblige you that 
you can suggest to it. For instance, in a March number of 
Hearth and Rome,''' there is a picture of the most delightful 
library-window imaginable, whose chief charm consists in 
the running vines that start from a longitudinal box at the 
bottom of the window, and thence clamber up and about 
the casing and across the rustic frame-work erected for its 
convenience. On the opposite page we present another 
plain kind of window, ornamented with a variety of these 
rural economical adornings. 

In the centre is a "Ward's case. On one side is a pot of 
Fuchsia. On the other side is a Calla Lily. In the hang- 
ing-baskets and on the brackets are the ferns and flowers 
that flourish in the deep woods, and around the window is 
the ivy, running from two boxes ; and, in case the window 
has some sun, a N'asturtion may spread its bright blossoms 
among the leaves. Then, in the winter, when there is less 
sun, the Striped Spider-wort, the Smilax and the Saodfraga

Samentosa (or Wandering Jew) may be substituted. Pretty 
brackets can be made of common pine, ornamented with 
odd-growing twigs or mosses or roots, scraped and varnished, 
or in their native state. 

A beautiful ornament for a room with pictures is Gen- 
man ivy. Slips of this will start without roots in bottles of 
water. Slide the bottle behind the picture, and the ivy will 
seem to come from fairyland, and hang its verdure in all 
manner of pretty curves around the picture. It may then 
be trained to travel toward other ivy, and thus aid in f orm- 
ing green cornice along the ceiling. We have seen some 
rooms that had an ivy cornice around the whole, giving 
the air of a leafy bower. 

There are some other odd devices to ornament a room. 
For example, a sponge, kept wet by daily immersion, can be 
iilled with flax-seed and suspended by a cord, when it will ere 
long be covered with verdure and afterward with flowers. 

A sweet potato, laid in a bowl of water on a bracket, or 
still better, suspended by a knitting-needle, run through or 
laid across the bowl half ill the water, will, in due time, make 
a beautiful verdant ornament. A large carrot, with the 
smallest half cut off, scooped out to hold water and then 
suspended with cords, will send out graceful shoots in rich 
profusion. 

Half a cocoa-nut shell, suspended, will hold earth or water* 
for plants and make a pretty hanging-garden. 

It may be a very proper thing to direct the ingenuity 
and activity of children into the making of hanging-baskets 
and vases of rustic work. The best foundations are the 
cheap wooden bowls, which are quite easy to get, and the 
walks of chil^en in the woods can be made interesting by 
their bringing home material for this rustic work. Different 
colored twigs and sprays of trees, such as the bright scarlet 
of the dog-wood, the yellow of the willow, the black of the 
birch, and the silvery gray of the poplar, may be combined 
in fanciful net-work For this sort of work, no other in-

vestment is needed than a hammer and an assortment of 
different-sized tacks, and beautiful results will be produced. 

Fig. 46 is a stand for 
flowers, made of roots, 
scraped and varnished. 
But the greatest and 
cheapest and most de- 
lightful fountain of 
beauty is a " Ward 
case." 

l^ow, immediately all 
our economical friends 
give up in despair. 
"Ward's cases sell all 
the way along from 
eighteen to fifty dol- 
lars, and are, like every 
thing else in this lower 
world, regarded as the 
sole perquisites of the 
rich. 
Let us not be too sure. Plate-glass, and hot-house plants, 
and rare patterns, are the especial inheritance of the rich ; 
but any family may command all the requisites of a Ward 
case for a very small sum. Such a case is a small' glass 
closet over a well-drained box of soil. You make a Ward 
case on a small scale when you turn a tumbler oyer a plant. 
The glass keeps the temperature moist and equable, and 
preserves the plants from dust, and the soil being well 
drained, they live and thrive accordingly. The requisites 
of these are the glass top and the bed of well-drained soil. 
Suppose you have a common cheap table, four feet long 
and two wide. , Take off the top boards of your table, and 
with them board the bottom across tight and firm ; then 
line it with zinc, and you will have a sort of box or sink on 
legs. Now make a top of common window-glass such as

you would get for a cucmnber-frame ; let it be two and a. 
half feet high, with a ridge-pole like a house, and a slant- 
ing roof of glass- 
I'ig- *'''• resting on this 

ridge-pole ; on 
one, end let there 
be a door two feet 
square. 

We have seen 
a Ward case made 
in this way, in 
which the capa- 
bilities for pro- 
ducing ornamen- 
tal effect were 
greatly beyond 
many of the most 
elaborate ones of 
the shops. It was 
large, and roomy, 
and cheap. Com- 
mon window-sash and glass are not dear, and any man with 
moderate ingenuity could fashion such a glass closet for 
his wife ; or a woman, not having such a husband, can do 
it herself. 

The sink or box part must have in the middle of it a hole 
of good size for drainage. In preparing for the reception 
of plants, first turn a plant-saucer over this hole, which may 
otherwise become stopped. Then, as directed for the other 
basket, proceed with a layer of broken charcoal and pot- 
sherds for drainage, two inches deep, and prepare the soil as 
directed above, and add to it some pounded charcoal, or 
the scrapings of the charcoal-bin. In short, more or less 
charcoal and charcoal-dust is always in order in the treat- 
ment of these moist subjects, as it keeps them from fer- 
menting and growing sour. 




HOME BECORATION. 101 

Now for filling the case. 

Our own native forest-ferns liave a period in the wintei 
months when they cease to grow. They are very particu- 
lar in asserting their right to this yearly nap, and will not, 
on any consideration, grow for you out of their appointed 
season. 

Nevertheless, we shall tell you what we have tried our- 
selves, because greenhouse ferns are expensive, and often 
great cheats when you have bought them, and die on your 
hands in the most reckless and shameless manner. If you 
make a "Ward case in the spring, your ferns will grow 
beautifully in it all summer ; and iu the autumn, though they 
stop growing, and cease to throw out leaves, yet the old 
leaves will remain fresh and green tUl the time for starting 
the new ones in the spring. 

But, supposing you wish to start your case in the fall, 
out of such things as you can find in the forest ; by search- 
ing carefully the rocks and clefts and recesses of the forest, 
you can find a quantity of beautiful ferns whose leaves the 
frost has not yet assailed. Gather them carefully, remem- 
bering that the time of the plant's sleep has come, and that 
you must make the most of the leaves it now has, as you 
will not have a leaf more from it till its waking-up time 
in February or March. But we have succeeded, and you 
wni succeed, in making a very charming and picturesque 
collection. You can make in your Ward case lovely lit- 
tle grottoes with any bits of shells, and minerals, and rocks 
you may have ; you can lay down, here and there, fra,g- 
ments of broken looking-glass for the floor of your grottoes, 
and the effect of them will be magical. A square of look- 
ing-glass introduced into the back side of your case will 
produce charming effects. 

The trailing arbutus or May-flower, if cut up carefully 
ill sods, and put into this Ward case, will come into bloom 
there a month sooner, than it otherwise would, and gladden 
your eyes and heart. 



X02 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

In the fall, if you can find tlie tufts of eye-bright or 
houstonia cerulia, and mingle them in with your mosses, 
you will find them blooming before winter is well over. 

But among the most beautiful things for such a case is 
the partridge-berry, with its red pbmis. The berries swell 
and increase in the moist atmosphere, and become intense 
in color, forming an admirable ornament. 

Then the ground pine, the princess pine, and various 
nameless pretty things of the woods, all fiourish in these 
little conservatories. In getting your sod of trailing arbu- 
tus, remember that this plant forms its buds in the fall. You 
must, therefore, examiae your sod carefally, and see if the 
buds are there ; otherwise you will find no blossoms in the 
spring. 

There are one or two species of violets, also, that form 
their buds in the fall, and these too, will blossom early for 
you. 

We have never tried the wild anemones, the crowfoot, etc. ; 
but as they all do well in moist, shady places, we recom 
mend hopefully the experiment of putting some of them 
in. 

A Ward case has this recommendation over common 
house-plants, that it takes so little time and care. If well 
made in the outset, and thoroughly drenched with water 
when the plants are first put in, it will after that need 
only to be watered about once a month, and to be ventilated 
by occasionally leaving open the door for a half-hour or 
hour when the moisture obscures the glass and seems ia 
excess. 

To women embarrassed with the care of little children, 
yet longing for the refreshment of something growing and 
t/eautiful, this indoor garden will be an untold treasure. 
The glass defends the plant from the inexpedient intermed- 
dling of little fingers ; while the little eyes, just on a level 
with the panes of glass, can look through and learn to enjoy 
the beautifal, silent miracles of nature. 



SOME DECORATION. 103 

For an invalid's chamber, such a case would be an inde- 
iBcribable comfort. It is, in fact, a fragment of the green 
woods brought in and silently growing ; it will refresh 
many a weary hour to watch it. 



VII. 

THE OAEE OF HEAiTH. 

Theee 18 no point where a woman is more liable to 
suflfer from a want of knowledge and experience than in 
reference to the health of a family committed to her care. 
Many a young lady who never had any charge of the sick ; 
who never took any care of an infant ; who never obtained 
information on these subjects from books, or from the ex- 
perience of others ; in short, with little or no preparation, 
has found herself the principal attendant in dangerous, sick- 
ness, the chief nurse of a feeble infant, and the responsible 
guardian of the health of a whole family. 

The care, the fear, the perplexity of a woman suddenly 
called to these unwonted duties, none can realize till they 
themselves feel it, or till they see some young and anxious 
novice first attempting to meet such responsibilities. To 
a woman of age and experience these duties often involve 
a measure of trial and difficulty at times deemed almost in- ' 
supportable ; how hard, then, must they press on the heart 
of the young and inexperienced ! 

There is no really efficacious mode of preparing a 
woman to take a rational care of the health of a family, 
except by communicating that knowledge in regard to the 
construction of the body and the laws of health which' is 
the basis of the medical profession. Not that a woman 
should undertake the minute and extensive investigation 
requisite for a physician ; but she should gain a general 
knowledge of first principles, as a guide to her judgment 
in emergencies when she can rely on no other aid. 



THE CARE OF SBALTH. 105 

With this end in view, in the preceding chapters some 
portions of the organs and functions of the human body 
have been presented, and others will now follow in connec- 
tion with the practical duties which result from them. 

On the general subject of health, one recent discovery 
of science may here be introduced as having an important 
relation to every organ and function of the body, and as 
being one to which frequent reference will be made ; ancj 
that is, the nature and operation of cell-life. 

By the aid of the microscope, we can examine the minute 
construction of plants and animals, in which we discover 
contrivances and operations, if not so sublime, yet more 
wonderful and interesting, than the vast systems of worlds 
revealed by the telescope. 

By this instrument it is now seen that the first forma- 
tion, as well as future changes and actions, of all plants and 
animals are accomplished by means of small cells or bags 
containing various kinds of liquids. These cells are so 
minute that, of the smallest, some hundreds would not 
cover the dot of a printed i on this page. They are of di- 
verse shapes and contents, and perform various different 
operations. 

The first formation of every animal is accomplished by 
the agency of cells, and may be il- 
lustrated by the egg of any bird or 
fowl. The exterior consists of a 
hard shell for protection, and this 
is lined with a tough skin, to which 
is fastened the yelk, (which means 
the yellow^ by fibrous strings, as 
seen at a, a, in the diagram. In 
the yelk floats the germ-cell, 5, which is the point where the 
formation of the future animal commences. The yelk, 
being lighter than the white, rises upward, and the germ 
being still lighter, rises in the yelk. This is to bring both 
nearer to the vitalizing warmth of the brooding mother. 




J06 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

New cells are gradually formed from tlie nourishing 
yelt around tlie germ, each being at first roundish in 
"shape, and having a spot near the centre, called the 
nucleus. The reason why cells increase must remain a 
mystery, until we can penetrate the secrets of vital force 
—probably forever. But the mode in which they mul- 
tiply is as follows: The first change noticed in a cell, 
when warmed into vital activity, is the appearance of a 
second nucleus within it, while the cell gradually becomes 
oval in form, and then is drawn inward at the niiddle, Kke 
an hour-glass, till the two sidss meet. The two portions 
then divide, and two cells appear, each containing its own, 
germinal nucleus. These both divide again in the same 
manner, proceeding in the ratio of 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on,, 
until most of the yelk becomes a mass of cells. 

The central point of this mass, where the animal itself' 
commences to appear, shows, first, a round-shaped figure,, 
which soon assumes form like a pear, and then like a, 
violin. Gradually the busy little cells arrange themselves 
to build up heart, lungs, brain, stomach, and limbs, for 
which the yelk and white furnish nutriment. There is a 
small bag of air fastened to one end inside of the shell;, 
and when the animal is complete, this air is taken into its 
lungs, life begins, and out walks little chick, all its powera 
prepared, and ready to run, eat, and enjoy existence. Then,^ 
as soon as the animal use's its brain to think and feel, and 
its muscles to move, the cells which have been made up 
into these parts begin to decay, while new cells are formed- 
from the blood to take their place. Thus with life com- 
mences the constant process of decay and renewal all over 
the body. 

The liquid portion of the blood consists of material 
formed from food, air, and water. From this material the 
cells of the blood are formed : first, the white cells, which 
are incomplete in formation ; and then the red cells, which 
are completed by the addition of the oxygen received from.

floating in the blood. Sur^ 
rounding the blood-vessels 
are the cells forming the ad- 
jacent membrane, h h, each 
having a nucleus in its centre. 
Cells have different powers 
of selecting and secreting 
diverse materials from the 
blood. Thus, some secrete 
bile to carry to the liver, 
others secrete saliva for the 
mouth, others take up the 
tears, and stiU others take 
material for the brain, mus- 
Oells also have a converting 
power, of taking one kind of matter from the blood, and 
changing it to another kind. .They are minute chemical 
laboratories all over the body, changing materials of one 
kind to another form in which they can be made useful. 

Both animal and vegetable substances are formed of 
cells. But the vegetable cells take up and use unorgan- 
ized or simple, natural matter ; whereas the animal cell 
only takes substances already organized into vegetable or 
animal life, and then changes one compound into another 
■of different proportions and nature. 

These curious facts in regard to cell-life have important 
relations to the general subject of the care of health, and 
also to, the cure of disease, as will be noticed in following 
chapters. 

THE NEEVOUS SYSTEM.

There is another portion of the body, which is so inti- 
mately connected with every other that it is placed in this

chapter as also having reference to every department in 
the general subject of the care of health. 

The body has no power to move itself, but is a collection 
of instruments to be used by the mind in securing various 
kinds of knowledge and enjoyment. The organs through 
which the mind thus operates are the hrain and nerves. 
The drawing (Fig. 50) represents them. 

The brain lies in the skull, 
^'^' ^"^ and is divided into the l^rge 

or upper brain, marked 1, 
and the small or lower brain, 
marked 2. From the brain 
runs the spinal marrow 
through the spine or back- 
bone. From each side of the 
spine the large nerves run 
out into innumerable smallei 
branches to every portion of 
the body. The drawing 
shows only some of the larg- 
er branches. Those marked 
3 run to the neck and organs 
of the chest ; those marked 4 
go to the arms ; those, below 
the arms, marked 3, go to 
the trunk ; and those marked 
5 go to the legs. 

The brain and nerves con- 
sist of two kinds of nervous 
matter — ^the gray, which is supposed to be the portion 
that originates and controls a nervous fluid which imparts 
power of action ; and the white, which seems to conduct 
this fluid to every part of the body. 

The brain and nervous system are divided into distinct 
portions, each having difierent oflfices to perform, and each 
acting independently of the others ; as, for example, one 




THE CARE OF HEALTH. 109 

portion is employed by the mind in thinking, and in feeling 
pleasurable or painful mental emotions ; another in moving 
the muscles ; while the nerves that run to the nose, ears, 
eyes, tongue, hands, and surface generally, are employed in 
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling all p^hysical 
sensations. 

The lack portion of the spinal marrow and the nerves 
that run fi'om it are employed in sensation, or the sense of 
feeling. These nerves extend over the whole body, but are 
largelj"- developed in the network of nerves in the skin. 
The front portion of the spinal marrow and its branches 
are employed in moving those muscles in all parts of the 
body which are controlled by the loill or choice of the mind. 
These are called the nerves of motion. 

The nerves of sensation and nerves of motion, although 
they start from different portions of the spine, are united 
in the same sheath or cover, till they terminate in the 
muscles. Thus, every muscle is moved by nerves of motion ; 
while alongside of this nerve, in the same sheath, is a nerve 
of sensation. AU the nerves of motion and sensation are 
connected with those portions of the brain used when we 
think, feel, and choose. By this arrangement the mind 
knows what -is wanted in all parts of the body by means of 
the nei-ves of sensation, and then it acts by means of the 
nerves of motion. 

For example, when we feel the cold air on the skin, the 
nerves of sensation report to the brain, and thus to the 
mind, that the body is growing cold. The mind thus 
knows that more clothing is needed, and wills to have the 
eyes look for it, and the hands and feet move to get it. 
This is done by the nerves of sight and of motion. 

Next are the nerves of imuolv/ntary motiov.; which move 
all those parts of the head, face, and body that are used in 
breathing, and in other operations connected with it. By' 
these we continue to breathe when asleep, and whether we 
will to do so or not. There are also some of the nerves of 



110 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

voluntary motion that are mixed with these, which enable 
the mind to stop respiration, or to regulate it to a certain 
extent. But the mind has no power to stop it for any 
great length of time. 

There is another large and important system of nerves 
called the sympathetic or ganglionic system. It consists of 
small masses of gray and white nervous matter, that seem 
to he small brains with nerves running from them. These 
are called ganglia, and are arranged on each side of the 
sphie, while small nerves from the spinal marrow run into 
them, thus uniting the sympathetic system with the nerves 
of the spine. These ganglia are also distributed around in 
various parts of the interior of the body, especially in the 
intestines, and all the different ganglia are connected with 
each other by nerves, thus making one system. It is the 
ganglionic system that carries on the circulation of the 
blood, the action of the capillaries, lymphatics, arteries, and 
veins, together with the work of secretion, absorption, and 
most of the internal working of the body, which goes for- 
ward without any knowledge or control of the mind. 

Every portion of the body has nerves of sensation com- 
ing from the spine, and also branches of the sympathetic 
or ganglionic system. The object of this is to form a sym- 
pathetic communication between the several parts of the 
body, and also to enable the mind to receive, through the 
brain, some general knowledge of the state of the whole 
system. It is owing to this that, when one portion of the 
body is affected, other portions sympathize. For example, 
if one part of the body is diseased, the stomach may so sym- 
pathize as to lose all appetite until the disease is removed. 

All the operations of the nervous system are performed 
lly the influence of the nervous fluid, which is generated 
hi the gray portions of the brain and ganglia. Whenever 
a ner^'e is cut off from its connection with these nervous 
centres, its power is gone, and the part to which it minis 
tered becomes lifeless and incapable of motion. 



TSE CARE OF HEALTH. Ill 

The brain and nerves can be overworked, and can also 
suffer for want of exercise, just as the muscles do. It is 
necessary for the perfect health of the brain and nerves 
that the several portions be exercised sufficiently, and that 
no part be exhausted by over-action. For example, the 
nerves of sensation may be very much exercised, and the 
nerves of motion have but little exercise. In this case, one 
will be weakened by excess of work, and the other by 
the want of it. 

It is found by experience that the proper exercise of the 
nerves of motion tends to reduce any extreme suscepti- 
bility of the nerves of sensation. On the contrary, the 
neglect of such exercise tends to produce an excessive 
sensibility in the nerves of sensation. 

"Whenever that part of the brain which is employed in 
thinking, feeling, and willing, is greatly exercised by hard 
study, or by excessive care or emotion, the blood tends to 
the brain to supply it with increased nourishrnent, just as 
it flows to the muscles when they are exercised. Over-ex- 
ercise of this portion of the brain causes engorgement of 
the blood-vessels. This is sometimes indicated by pain, or 
by a sense of fullness in the head ; but oftener the result 
is a debilitating drain on the nervous system, which de- 
pends for its supply on the healthful state of the brain. 

The brain has, as it were, a fountaia of supply for the 
nervous fluid, which flows to all the nerves, and stimulates 
them to action. Some brains have a larger, and some a 
smaller fountain ; so that a degree of mental activity that 
would entirely exhaust one, would make only a small and 
healthful drain upon another. 

The excessive use of certain portions of the brain tends 
to withdraw th« nervous energy from other portions ; so 
that when one part is detiHtated by excess, another fails by 
neglect. For example, a person may so exhaust the brain 
power in the excessive use of the nerves of motion by 
hard work, as to leave little for any other faculty. On the 



112 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

otlier hand, the nerves of feeling and thinking may be so 
used as to withdraw the nervous fluid from the nerves of 
motion, and thus debilitate the muscles. 

Some animal propensities may be indulged to such ex- 
cess as to produce a constant tendency of the blood to a 
certain portion of the brain, and to the organs connected 
with it, and thus cause a constant and excessive excite- 
ment, which finally becomes a disease. Sometimes a para- 
lysis of this j)ortion of the brain results from such an 
entire exliaustion of the nervous fountain and of the over- 
worked nerves. 

Thus, also, the thinking portion of the brain may be so 
overworked as to drain the nervous fluid fr'om other por- 
tions, which become debilitated by the loss. And in this 
way, also, the overworked portion may be diseased or 
paralyzed by the excess. 

The necessity for the equal development of all portions of 
the brain by an appropriate exercise of all the faculties of 
mind and body, and the influence of this upon happiness, 
is the most important portion of this subject, and will be 
more directly exhibited in another chapter. 



Yni. 

DOMESTIC EXEECISE. 

In a work whicli aims to influence women to train the 
young to honor domestic labor and to seek healthful exer- 
cise in home pursuits, there is special reason for explaining 
the construction of the muscles and their connection with 
the nerves, these being the chief organs of motion. 

The muscles, as seen by the naked eye, consist of very 
fine fibres or strings, bound up in smooth, silky casings of 
thin membrane. But each of these visible fibres or strings 
the microscope shows to be made up of still finer strings, 
numbering from five to eight hundred in each fibre. And 
each of these microscopic fibres is a series or chain of 
elastic cells, which are so minute that one hundred thou- 
sand would scarcely cover a capital on this page. 

The peculiar property ot the cells which compose the 
muscles is their elasticity, no other cells of the body having 

this property. At Fig. 61 is a 

^^' ^*' diagram representing a micro- 

y..y . s/s>Y'WY \ scopic muscular fibre, in which 

vXAA AAAy the cells are relaxed, a§ in the 

natural state of rest. But when 

the muscle contracts, each of its numberless cells in all its 

small fibres becomes widened, making

^ thicker, as at Fig. 52. This explains

store the part moved to its natural state. The muscles that 
move or bend any part are called _^ea;ors, and those that re- 
store the natural position are called extensors.

^ to the bones by strong tendons and carti- 

lages ; and around the wrist, in the draw- 
ing, is shown a band of cartilage to con- 
fine them in place. The muscle marked 
8 is the extensor that straightens the fin- 
gers after they have been closed by a 
flexor the other side of the arm. In like 
manner, each motion of the arm and fin- 
gers has one muscle to produce it and 
another to restore to the natural position. 
The muscles are dependent on the 
brain and nerves for power to move. It 
has been shown that the gray matter of 
the brain and spinal marrow furnishes 
the stimulating power that moves the 
muscles, and causes sensations of touch 
on the skin, and the other sensations of 
the several senses. The white part of the brain and spinal 
marrow consists solely of conducting tubes to transmit this 
influence. Each of the minute fibrils of the muscles has a 
small conducting nerve connecting it with the brain or 
spinal marrow, and in this respect each muscular fibril is 
separate from every other. 

When, therefore, the mind wills to move a flexor muscle 
of the arm, the gray matter sends out the stimulus through

the nerves to tlie cells of each individual fibre of that 
muscle, and they contract. When this is done, the nerve 
of sensation reports it to the brain and mind. If the mind 
desires to return the arm to its former position, then fol- 
lows the willing, and consequent stimulus sent through the 
nerves to the corresponding muscle ; its cells contract, and 
the limb is restored. 

When the motion is a compound one, involving the 
action of several muscles at the same time, a multitude of 
impressions are sent back and forth to and from the brain 
through the nerves. But the person acting thus is uncon- 
scious of all this delicate and wonderful mechanism. He 
wills the movement, and instantly the requisite nervous 
power is sent to the required cells and fibres, and they 
perform the motions required. Many of the muscles are 
moved by the sympathetic system, over which the mind 
has but little control. 

Among the muscles and nerves so intimately connected, 
run the minute capillaries of the blood, which furnish 
nourishment to all. 

Fig. 54 represents an artery at a, which brings pure 
blood to a muscle from the heart. After 
meandering through the capillaries at c, 
to distribute oxygen and food from the 
stomach, the blood enters the vein, 5, 
loaded with carbonic acid and water 
taken up in the capillaries, to be carried 
to the lungs or skin, and thrown out into 
the air. 

The manner in which the exercise 
of the muscles quickens the circula- 
tion of the blood will now be explained. 
The veins abound in every part of every 
muscle, and the large veins have valves which prevent the 
blood from flowing backward. If the wrist is grasped 
tightly, the veins of the hand are immediately swollen. 



Fig. 54. 



&■' 




116 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

This is owing to the fact that the blood is prevented from 
flowing toward the heart by this pressure, and by the vein- 
valves from returning into the arteries ; while the arteries 
themselves, being placed deeper down, are not so compressed, 
and continue to send the blood into the hand, and thus it ac- 
cumulates. As soon as this pressure is removed, the blood 
springs onward from the restraint with accelerated motion. 
This same process takes place when any of the muscles 
are exercised. The contraction of any muscle presses some 
of the veius, so that the blood can not flow the natural way, 
while the valves in the veins prevent its flowing backward. 
Meantime "the arteries continue to press the blood along 
until the veins become swollen. Then, as soon as the 
muscle ceases its contraction, the blood flows faster from 
the previous accumulation. 

If, then, we use a number of muscles, and use them 
strongly and quickly, there are so many veins affected in 
this way as to quicken the whole circulation. The heart 
receives blood faster, and sends it t& the lungs faster. 
Then the lungs work quicker, to furnish the oxygen re- 
quired by the greater amount of blood. The blood re- 
turns with greater speed to the heart, and the heart sends 
it out with quicker action through the arteries to the capil- 
laries. In the capillaries, too, the decayed matter is .car- 
ried off faster, and then the stomach calls for more food , 
to furnish new and pure blood. Thus it is that exercise 
gives new life and nourishment to every part of the body. 

It is the universal law of the human fi'ame that exercise 
is indispensable to the health of the several parts. Thus, 
if a blood-vessel be tied up, so as not to be used, it shrinks, 
' and becomes a useless string ; if a muscle be condemned 
to inaction, it shrinks in size and diminishes in power ; and 
thus it is also with the bones. Inactivity produces soft- 
ness, debility, and unfltness for the functions they are de- 
signed to perform. 

Now, the nerves, like all other parts of the body, gain 



^ DOMESTIC EXERCISE. 11 T 

and lose strength according as they are exercised. If they 
have too much or too little exercise, they lose strength ; 
if they are exercised to a proper degree, they gain strength. 
When the mind is continuously excited, by business, study, 
or the imagination, the nerves of emotion and sensation are 
kept in constant action, while the nerves of motion are un- 
employed. If this is continued for a long time, the nerves 
of sensation lose their strength from over -action, and the 
nerves of motion lose their power from inactivity. In 
consequence, there is a morbid excitability of the nervous, 
and a debility of the muscular system, which make all 
exertion irksome and wearisome. 

The only mode of preserving the health of these systems 
is to keep up ia them an equilibrium of action. For this 
pm-pose, occupations must be sought which exercise the 
muscles and interest the mind ; and thus the equal action 
of both kinds of nerves is secured. This shows why exercise 
is so much more healthful and invigorating when the mind 
is interested, than when it is not. As an illustration, let a 
person go shopping with a friend, and have nothing to do 
but look on. How soon do the continuous walking and stand- 
ing weary ! But, suppose one, thus wearied, hears of the 
arrival of a very dear friend : she can instantly walk off a 
mile or two to meet her, without the least feeling of fatigue. 
By this is shown the importance of furnishing, for young 
persons, exercise ia which they will take an interest. Long 
and foi-mal walks, merely for exercise, though they do some 
good, in securing fresh air, and some exercise of the mus- 
cles, would be of triple benefit if changed to amusing 
sports, or to the cultivation of fruits and flowers, in which 
it is impossible to engage without acqxuring a great inte- 
rest. 

It shows, also, why it is far better to trust to useful do- 
mestic exercise at home than to send a young person out to 
walk for the mere purpose of exercise. Young girls can 
seldom be made to realize the value of health, and the

need of exercise to secure it, so as to feel mucli interest in 
walking abroad, when they have no other object. But, if 
they are brought up to minister to the comfort and enjoy- 
ment of themselves and others, by performing domestic 
duties, they will constantly be interested and cheered in 
their exercise by the feeling of usefulness and the con- 
sciousness of having performed their duty. 

There are few young persons, it is hoped, who are brought 
up with such miserable habits of selfishness and indolence 
that they can not be made to feel happier by the conscious- 
ness of being usefully employed. And those who have 
never been accustomed to think or care for any one but 
themselves, and who seem to feel little pleasure in making 
themselves useful, by wise and proper influences can often 
be gradually awakened to the new pleasure of benevolent 
exertion to promote the comfort and enjoyment of others. 
And the more this sacred and elevating kind of enjoyment 
is tasted, the greater is the relish induced; Other enjoy- 
ments often cloy; but the heavenly pleasure secured by 
virtuous industry and benevolence, while it satisfies at the 
time, awakens fi-esh desires for the continuance of so enno- 
bling a good.

HEALTHFUL FOOD. 

The person who decides what shall be the food and 
drink of a family, and the modes of its preparation, is the 
one who decides, to a greater or less extent, what shall be 
the health of that family. It is the opiniop of most me- 
dical men, that intemperance in eating is one of the most 
fruitful of all causes of disease and death. If this be so, the 
woman who wisely adapts the food and cooking of her far- 
mily to the laws of health removes one of the greatest 
risks which threatens the lives of those under her care. 
But, unfortunately, there is no other duty that has been 
involved in more doubt and perplexity. "Were one to 
believe all that is said and written on this subject, the con- 
clusion probably would be, that there is not one solitary 
article of food on God's earth which it is healthful to eat. 
Happily, however, there are general principles on this 
subject whichj if understood and applied, will prove a safe 
guide to any woman of common sense ; and it is the object 
of the following chapter to set forth these principles. 

All material things on earth, whether solid, liquid, or 
gaseous, can be resolved into sixty-two simple substances, 
only fourteen of which are in the human body ; and these, 
in certain proportions, in all mankind. 

Thus, in a man weighing 154 lbs. are found, 111 lbs. 
oxygen gas, and 14 lbs. hydrogen gas, which, united, form, 
water ; 21 lbs. carbon ; 3 lbs. 8 oz. nitrogen gas ; 1 lb. 12 
3z. 190 grs. phosphorus ; 2 lbs. calcium, the chief ingre- 
<iient of bones ; 2 oz. fluorine ; 2 oz. 219 grs. sulphur ; 2 oz 



120 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

47 grs. chlorine; 2 oz. 116 grs. sodium; 100 grs. iron; 290 
grs. potassium ; 12 gi"s. magnesium ; and 2 grs. silicon. 

These simple substances are constantly passing out of 
the body thi'ough the lungs, skin, and other excreting 
organs. 

It is found that certain of these simple elements axe used 
for one part of the body, and others for other parts, and 
this in certain regular proportions. Thus, carbon is thp 
chief element of fat, and also supplies the fuel that con^ 
bines with oxygen in the capillaries ta produce animal 
heat. The nitrogen which we gain from our food and the 
air is the chief element of muscle ; phosphorus is the chief 
element of brain and nerves ; and calcium or lime is the 
hard portion of the bones. Iron is an important element 
of blood, and silicon supplies the hardest parts of the teeth, 
nails, and hair. ' 

Water, which is composed of the two gases, oxygen and 
hydrogen, is the largest portion of the body, forming its 
fluids ; there is four times as much of carbon as there is of 
nitrogen in the body ; whUe there is only two per cent as 
much phosphorus as carbon. A man weighing one hundred 
and fifty-four pounds, who leads an active life, takes into 
his stomach daily from two to three pounds of solid food, 
and from five to six pounds of liquid. At the same time he 
takes into his lungs, daily, four or five thousand gallons of . 
air. This amounts to three thousand pounds of nutriment 
received through stomach and lungs, and then expelled from 
the bodj', in one year ; or about twenty times the man's own 
weight. 

The change goes on in every minute point of the body, 
though in some parts much faster than in others ; as set 
forth in the piquant and sprightly language of Dr. 0. W 
Holmes,* who, giving a vivid picture of the constant deca^ 
and renewal of the body, says : 

• Atlmitte Almcmac, 1869, p. 40. 



BBALTSFUL FOOD. 121 

" Every organized heing always Iwes irnmersed in a 
strong solution of its own elements." 

" Sometimes, as in tlie case of the air-plant, the solution 
contains all its elements ; but in higher plants, and in ani- 
mals generally, some of the principal ones only. Take our 
own bodies, and we find the atmosphere contains the oxygen 
and the nitrogen, of which we are so largely made up, as its 
chief constituents ; the hydrogen^ also, in its watery vapor ; 
the carbon, in its carbonic acid. What oui- air-bath docs not 
furnish us, 'Te must take in the form of noiu'ishment, sup- 
plied through the digestive organs. But the first food we 
take, after we have set up for om'selves, is air, and the last 
food we take is air also. We are all chameleons in om* diet, 
as we are all salamanders in our habitats, inasmuch as we live 
always in the fire of our own smouldering combustion ; a 
gentle but constant flame, fanned every day by the same 
forty hogsheads of air which furnish us not with our daily 
bread, which we can live more than a day without touching, 
but with our momentary, and oftener than momentary, ali- 
ment, without which we can not live five minutes." 

" We are perishing and being born again at every instant. 
We do literally enter over and over again into the womb of 
that great mother, from whom we get our bones, and flesh, 
and blood, and man-ow. ' I die daily ' is true of all that 
live. If we cease to die, particle by particle, and to be born 
anew in the same proportion, the whole movement of life 
comes to an end, and swift, universal, ii-reparable decay re- 
solves our frames into the parent elements." 

" The products of the internal fire which consumes us over 
and over again every year, pass off mainly in smoke and 
eteam from the lungs and the skin. The smoke is only in- 
visible, because the combustion is so perfect. The steam is 
plain enough in our breaths on a frosty morning ; and an 
over-driven horse will show us, on a larger scale, the cloud 
that is always arising from own bodies." 

" Man walks, then, not only in a vain show, but wra',)ped 



122 TEE EOVSEKEEPER'S MANUAL, 

in an uncelestial aureole of his own material exhalations. 
A great mist of gases and of vapor rises day and night from 
the whole realm of living nature. The water and the car- 
bonic acid which animals exhale become the food of plants, 
whose leaves are at once lungs and mouths. The vegetable 
world reverses the breathing process of the animal creation, 
restoring the elements which that has combined and rendered 
effete for its own purposes, to their original condition. The 
salt-water ocean is, a great aquarium. The air ocean in 
which we live is a ' Wardian case,' of larger dimensions." 

It is found that the simple elements will not nourish 
the body in their natural state, but only when organized, 
either as vegetable or animal food ; and, to the dismay of 
the Grahamite or vegetarian school, it is now established 
by chemists that animal and vegetable food contain the 
same elements, and in nearly the same proportions. 

Thus, in animal food, carbon predominates in fats, while 
in vegetable food it shows itself in sugar, starch, and vege- 
table oils. ISTitrogen is found in animal food in the albu- 
men, fibrin, and caseine ; while in vegetables it is in 
gluten, albumen, and caseine. 

It is also a curious fact that, in all articles of food, the 
elements that nourish diverse parts of the body are divided 
into separable portions, and also that the pro- 
Fig. 55. portions correspond in a great degree to the » 
wants of the, body. For example, a kernel of 
wheat contains all the articles demanded for 
every part of the body. Fig. 55 represents, 
upon an enlarged scale, the position and pro- 
portions of the chief elements required. The 
white central part is the largest in quantity, 
and is chiefly carbon in the form of starch, , 
which supplies fat and fuel for the capillaries. The 
shaded outer portion is chiefly nitrogen,' which nourishes 
the muscles, and the dark spot at the bottom is prin- 
cipally phosphorus, which nourishes the brain and 




SEALTSFUL FOOD. 12& 

nerves. And these elements are in due proportion to the 
demands of the body. A portion of the outer covering of 
a wheat-kernel holds lime, silica, and iron, which are 
needed by the body, and which are found in no other part 
of the gi-aia. The woody fibre is not digested, but serves 
by its bulk and stimulating action to facilitate digestion. 
It is therefore evident that bread made of unbolted flour 
is more healthful than that made of superfine flour. The 
process of bolting removes all the woody fibre ; the lime 
needed for the bones ; the silica for hair, nails, and te^th ; 
the iron for the blood; and most of the nitrogen and 
phosphorus needed for muscles, brain, and nerves. 
, Experiments on animals prove that fine fiour alone, 
which is ehiefiy carbon, will not sustain life more than a 
month, while unbolted flour furnishes all that is needed 
for every part of the body. There are cases where persons 
can not use such coarse bread, on account of its irritating 
action on inflamed coats of the stomach. For such, a 
kind of wheaten grit is provided, containing all the kernel 
of the wheat, except the outside woody fibre. 

When the body requires a given kind of diet, specially de- 
manded by brain, lungs, or muscles, the appetite will crave 
food for it until the necessary amount of this article is secured. 
K, then, the food in which the needed aliment abounds 
is not supplied, other food will be taken in larger quanti- 
ties than needed until that amount is gained. For all kinds 
of food have supplies for every want of the body, though 
in different proportions. Thus, for example, if the muscles 
are worked a great deal, food in which nitrogen abounds is 
required, and the appetite will continue until the requisite 
amount of nitrogen is secured. If, then, food is taken 
which has not the requisite quantity, the consequence 
is, that more is taken than the system can use, while 
the vital powers are needlessly taxed to throw ofi' the 
excess. 

These facts were ascertained by Liebig, a celebrated Ger 



124 . THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL- 

man chemist and physicist, who, assisted by his goTcm- 
ment, conducted experiments' on a large scale in prisons, in 
armies, and in hospitals. Among other results, he states 
that those who use potatoes for theu* principal food eat them 
in very much larger quantities than their bodies would de- 
mand if they used also other food. The reason is, that the 
potato has a very large proportion of starch that supplies 
only fuel for the capillaries and very little nitrogen to feed 
the muscles. For this reason lean meat is needed with 
potatoes. 

In comparing wheat and potatoes we find that in one 
hundred parts wheat there are fourteen parts nitrogen for 
muscle, and two parts phosphorus for brain and nerves, 
But in the potato there is only one part in one hundred 
for muscle,' and nine tenths of one part of phosphorus for 
brain and nerves. 

The articles containing most of the three articles needed 
generally in the body are as follows : for fat and heat-mak- 
ing — butter, lard, sugar, and molasses ; for muscle-making 
— ^lean meat, cheese, peas, beans, and lean fishes ; for brain 
and nerves — shell-fish, lean meats, peas, beans, and very 
active birds and fishes who live chiefly on food in which 
phosphorus abounds. In a meat diet, the fat supplies car- 
bon for the capillaries and the lean famishes nutriment for 
muscle, brain, and nerves. Green vegetables, fruits, and 
berries furnish the acid and water needed. 

In grains used for food, the proportions of useful ele- 
ments are varied ; there is in some more of carbon and in 
others more of nitrogen and phosphorus. For example, 
in oats there is more of nitrogen for the muscles, and less 
carbon for the lungs, than can be found in wheat. In 
the corn of the North, where cold weather demands fuel 
for lungs and capillaries, there is much more carbon to 
supply it than is found in the Southern corn. 

From these statements it may be seen that -^nc of the 
chief mistakes in providing food for families has been in 



HJ^ALTBFUL FOOD. 125 

changing tlie proportions of the elements nature has fitted 
for our food. Thus, fine wheat is deprived by bolting of 
some of the most important of its nourishing elements, 
leaving carbon chiefly, which, after supplying fuel for the 
capillaries, must, if in excess, be sent out of the body ; thus 
needlessly taxing all the excreting organs. So milk, which 
contains all the elements needed by the body, has the cream 
taken out and used for butter, which again is chiefly carbon. 
Then, sugar and molasses, cakes and candies, are chiefly 
carbon, and supply but very little of other nourishing ele- 
ments, while to make them safe much exercise in cold and 
pure air is necessary. And yet it is the children of the 
rich, housed in chambers and school-rooms most of their 
time, who are fed with these dangerous dainties, thus 
weakening their constitutions, and inducing fevers, colds, 
ajid many other diseases. 

The proper digestion of food depends on the wants of 
the body, and on its power of appropriating the aliment 
supplied. The best of food can not be properly digested 
when it is not needed. All that the system requires will 
be used, and the rest will be thrown out by the several ex- 
creting organs, which thus are frequently over^taxed, and 
vital forces are wasted. Even food of poor quality may 
digest weU if the demands of the system are urgent. The 
way to increase digestive power is to increase the demand 
for food by pure air and exercise of the muscles, quickening 
the blood, and arousing the whole system to a more rapid 
and vigorous rate of life. 

Kules for persons in fall health, who enjoy pure air and 
exercise, are not suitable for those whose digestive powers 
are feeble, or who are diseased. On the other hand, many 
rules for invalids are not needed by the healthful, while 
rules for one class of invalids will not avail for other classes. 
Every weak stomach has its peculiar wants, and can not 
furnish guidance for others. 

We are' now ready to consider intelligently the following 



126 ■ THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

general principles in regard to the proper selection ol 
food: 

Vegetable and animal food are equally healthful if 
apportioned to the given circumstances. 

In cold weather, carbonaceous food, such as butter, 
fats, sugar, molasses, etc., can be used more safely than in 
warm weather. And they can be used more safely by 
those who exercise in the open air than by those of confined 
and sedentary habits. 

Students who need food with little carbon, and women 
wha live in the house, should always seek coarse bread, 
fruits, and lean meats, and avoid butter, oils, sugar, and 
molasses, and articles containing them. 

Many students and women using little exercise in the 
open air, grow thin and weak, because the vital powers are 
exhausted in throwing off excess of food, especially of the 
carbonaceous. The liver is especially taxed in such cases, 
being unable to remove all the excess of carbonaceous mat- 
ter from the blood, and thus "biliousness" ensues, par- 
ticularly on the approach of warm weather, when the air 
bi'ings less oxygen than in cold. 

It is found, by experiment, that the supply of gastric 
juice, furnished from the blood by the arteries of the 
stomach, is proportioned, not to the amount of food put 
into the stomach, but to the wants of the body ; so that it 
is possible to put much more into the stomach than 
can be digested. To guide and regulate in this matter, the 
sensation called hunger is provided. In a healthy state ot 
the body, as soon as the blood has lost its nutritive supplies, 
the craving of hunger is felt, and then, if the food is suit- 
able, and is taken in the proper manner, this sensation 
ceases as soon as the stomach has received enough to supply 
the wants of the system. But our benevolent Creator, in 
this, as in, our other duties, has connected enjoyment with 
the operation needful to sustain our bodies. In addition 
to the allaying of hunger, the gratification of the palate is 



HEALTHFUL FOOD. 12'; 

secured by the immense variety of food, some articles of 
whicli are far more agreeable than others. 

Tliis arrangement of Providence, designed for our happi- 
ness, has become, either through ignorance, or want of 
self-control, the chief cause of the many diseases and suffer- 
ings which afflict those classes who have the means of seek- 
ing a variety to gratify the palate. If mankind had only 
one article of food, and only water to drink, though they 
would have less enjoyment in eating, they would never be 
tempted to put any more into the stomach than the calls of 
hunger require. But the customs of society, which present 
an incessant change, and a great variety of food, with those 
various condiments which stimulate 9,ppetite, lead almost 
every person very frequently to eat merely to gratify the 
palate, after the stomach has been abundantly supplied, 
so that hunger has ceased. 

When too great a supply of food is put into the stomach, 
the gastric juice dissolves only that portion which the wants 
of the system demand. Most of the remainder is ejected, 
in an unprepared state; the absorbents take portions of it 
into the system ; and all the various functions of the body, 
which depend on the ministries of the blood, are thus 
gradually and imperceptibly injured. Very often, intem- 
perance in eating produces immediate results, such as colic, 
headaches, pains of indigestion, and vertigo. 

But the more general result is a gradual undermining of 
all parts of the human frame ; thus imperceptibly shorten- 
ing life, by so weakening the constitution, that it is ready 
to yield, at every point, to any uncommon risk or exposure. 
Thousands and thousands are passing out of. the world, 
from diseases occasioned by exposures which a healthy con- 
stitution could meet without any danger. It is owing to these 
considerations, that it becomes the duty of every woman, 
who has the responsibility of providing food for a family, 
to avoid a variety of tempting dishes. It is a much safei 
rule, to have only one kind of healthy food, for each meal, 



128 



THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL.

than tlie too abundant variety which is often met at the 
tables of almost all classes in this country. When there is 
to be any variety of dishes, they ought not to be successive, 
but so arranged as to give the opportunity of selection. 
How often is it the case, that persons, by the appearance 
of a favorite article, are tempted to eat merely to gratify 
the palate, when the stomach is already adequately supplied. 
All such intemperance wears on the constitution, and 
shortens life. It not unfrequently happens that excess in 
eating produces a morbid appetite, which must constantly 
be denied. 

But the organization of the digestive organs demands, 
not only that food should be taken in proper quantities, 
but that it be taken at proper times. 

Fig. 56 shows one 
important feature of 
the digestive organs 
relating to this point. 
The part marked L M 
shows the muscles of 
the inner coat of the 
stomach, which run 
in one direction, and 
- C M shows the mus- 
cles of the outer coat, 
running in another 
direction. 
As soon as the food enters the stomach, the muscles are 
excited by the nerves, and the peristaltic motion commences. 
This is a powerful and constant exercise of the muscles of 
the stomach, which continues until the process of digestion 
is complete. During this time the blood is withdrawn from 
other parts of the system, to supply -the demands of the 
stomach, which is laboring hard with all its muscles. 
Wlien this motion ceases, and the digested food has gradu- 
ally passed out, nature requires that the stomach should 




SB.ALTSFUL FOOD. 129 

have a period of repose. And if another meal be ^aten 
immediately after one is digested, the stomach is set to 
work again before it has had time to rest, and before a suffi- 
cient supply of gastric juice is provided. 

The general rule, then, is, that three hours be given to 
the stomach for labor, and two for rest ; and in obedience 
to this, five hours, at least, ought to elapse between every 
two regular meals. In cases where exercise produces a flow 
of perspiration, more food is needed to supply the loss; 
and strong laboring men may safely eat as often as they 
feel the want of food. So, young and healthy children, who 
gambol and exercise much and whose bodies grow fast, may 
have a more frequent supply of food. But, as a general 
rule, meals should be five hours apart, and eating between 
meals avoided. There is nothing more unsafe, and wearing 
to the constitution, than a habit of eating at any time 
merely to gratify the palate. When a tempting article is 
presented, every person should exercise sufficient self-denial 
to wait till the proper time for eating arrives. Children, 
as wen as grown persons, are often injured by eating be- 
tween their regular meals, thus weakening the stomach by 
not affording it any time for rest. 

In deciding as to quantity of food, there is one great diffi- 
culty to be met by a large portion of the community. The 
exercise of every part of the biody is necessary to its health 
and perfection. The bones, the muscles, the nerves, the 
organs of digestion and respiration, and the skin, all de- 
mand exercise, in order properly to perform their functions. 
"When the muscles of the body are called into action, all the 
blood-vessels entwined among them are frequently com- 
pressed. As the veins have valves so contrived that the 
blood can not run back, this compression hastens it for- 
ward toward the heart; which is immediately put in 
quicker motion, to send it into the lungs ; and they, also, 
are thus stitnulated to more rapid action, which is the cause

blood thus courses with greater celerity through the body, 
and sooner loses its nourishing properties. Then the sto- 
mach issues its mandate of hunger, and a new supply of 
food must be furnished. 

Thus it appears, as a general rule, that the quantity of 
food actually needed by the body depends on the amount 
of muscular exercise taken. A laboring man, in the open 
fields, probably throws off from his skin and lungs a much 
larger amount than a person of sedentary pursuits. In 
consequence of this, he demands a greater amount of food 
and drink. 

Those persons who keep their bodies in a state of health 
by sufficient exercise can always be guided by the calls of 
hunger. They can eat when they feel hungry, and stop 
when hunger ceases ; and thus they will calculate exactly 
right. But the difficulty is, that a large part of the com- 
munity, especially women, are so inactive in their habits 
that they seldom feel the calls of hunger. They habitually 
eat, merely to gratify the palate. This produces such a 
state of the system that they lose the guide which Nature 
has provided. They are not called to eat by hunger, nor 
admonished, by its cessation, when to stop. In consequence 
of this, such persons eat what pleases the palate, till they 
feel no more inclination for the article. It is probable that 
three fourths of the women in the wealthier circles sit 
down to each meal without any feeling of hunger, and eat 
merely on account of the gratification thus afforded them. 
Such persons find their appetite to depend almost solely 
upon the kind of food on the table. This is not the case 
with those who take the exercise which Nature demands. 
They approach their meals in such a state that almost any 
kind of food is acceptable. 

The question then arises. How are persons, who have lost 
the guide which Nature has provided, to determine as to the 
proper amount of food they shall take ? 

The best method is for several days to take their 



HEALTBFUL FOOD. 131 

ordinary exercise and eat only one or two articles of 
simple food, such as bread and milk, or bread and butter 
with cooked fruit, or lean meat witb bread and vegetables, 
and at the same time eat less tban the appetite demands. 
Then on the following two days, take just enough to 
satisfy the appetite, and on the third day notice the quan- 
tity which satisfies. After this, decide before eating that 
only this amount of simple food shall be taken. 

Persons who have a strong constitution, and take much 
exercise, may eat almost any tiling with apparent impimity ; 
but young childi-en who are forming their constitutions, and 
persons who are delicate, and who take but little exercise, 
are very dependent for health on a proper selection of food. 
It is found that there are some kinds of food which afford 
nutriment to the blood, and do not produce any other eflfect 
on the system. There are other kinds, which are not only 
nourishing, but stimulating, so that they quicken the func- 
tions of the organs on which they operate. The condiments 
used in cookery, such as pepper, mustard, and spices, are of 
this nature. There are certain states of the system when 
these stimulants may be beneficial ; such cases can only be 
pointed out by medical men. 

Persons in perfect health, and especially young children, 
never receive any benefit from such kind of food ; and just 
in proportion as condiments operate to quicken the labors 
of the internal organs, they tend to wear down their powers. 
A person who thus keeps the body working under an im- 
natural excitement, Iwe faster than Nature designed, and 
the constitution is w'om out just so much the sooner. A 
woman, therefore, should provide dishes for her family which 
are free from these stimulating condiments. 

It is also found, by experience, that the lean part of ani- 
mal food is more stimulating than vegetable. This is the 
reason why, in cases of fevers or inflammations, medical 
men forbid the use of meat. A person who lives chiefly on 
animal food is under a Higher degree of stimulus than if his 



132 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

food was cMefly composed of vegetable substances. His blood 
will flow faster, and all the functions of Ms body wiU be 
quickened. This makes it important to secure a proper pro- 
portion of animal and vegetable diet. Some medical men 
suppose that an exclusively vegetable diet is proved, by the 
experience of many individuals, to be fully sufficient to nou- 
rish the body ; and bring, as evidence, the fact that some of 
the strongest and most robust men in the world are those 
who are trained, from infancy, exclusively on vegetable food. 
From this they infer that life will be shortened just ia pro- 
portion as the diet is changed to more stimulating articles ; 
and that, all other things being equal, children will have a 
better chance of health and long life if they are brought 
up solely on vegetable food. 

' But, though this is not the common opinion of medical 
men, they all agree that, in America, far too large a por- 
tion of the diet consists of animal food. As a nation, the 
Americans are proverbial for the gross and luxurious diet 
with which they load their tables; and there can be no 
doubt that the general health of the nation would be in- 
creased by a change in our customs in this respect. To take 
meat but once a day, and this in small quantities, compared 
with the common practice, is a rule, the observance of which 
would probably greatly reduce the amount of fevers, erup- 
tions, headaches, bilious attacks, and the many other ail- 
ments which are produced or aggravated by too gross a diet. 
The celebrated Eoman physician, Baglivi, (who, from 
practicing extensively among Koman Catholics, had ample 
opportunities to observe,) mentions that, in Italy, an un- 
usual number of people recover their health in the forty days 
of Lent, in consequence of the lower diet which is required 
as a religious duty. An American physician remarks, " Foi 
every reeling drunkard that disgraces our country, it con- 
tains one hundred gluttons — persons, I mean, who eat to 
excess, and suffer in consequence.'^ Another distinguished 
physician says, " I believe that every stomach, not actually 



HEALTHFUL FOOD. 135 

iaipaired by organic disease, will perform its functions, if 
it receives reasonable attention ; and when we perceive the 
manner in which diet is generally conducted, both in regard 
to quantity and variety of articles of food and drink, which 
are mixed up in one heterogeneous mass — instead of being 
astonished at the prevalence of indigestion, our wonder must 
rather be that, in such circumstances, any stomach is capa- 
ble of digesting at all." 

In regard to articles which are the most easily digested, 
only general rules can be given. Tender meats are digest- 
ed more readily than those Avhich are tough, or than many 
kinds of vegetable food. The farinaceous articles, such as 
rice, floui', corn, potatoes, and the like, are the most nutri- 
tious, and most easily digested. The popular notion, that 
meat is more nom-ishing than bread, is a great mistake. 
Good bread contains more nourishment than butcher's meat. 
The meat is more stimulating, and for this reason is more 
readily digested. 

A perfectly healthy stomach can digest almost any health- 
ful food ; but when the digestive powers are weak, every 
stomach has its peculiarities, and what is good for one is 
hurtful to another. In such cases, experiment alone can 
decide which are the most digestible articles of food. A 
person whose food troubles him must deduct one article 
after another, till he learns, by experience, which is the best 
for digestion. Much evil has been done, by assuming that 
the powers of one stomach are to be made the rule in regu- 
lating every other. 

The most unhealthful kinds of f oo'd are those which are 
made so by bad cooking ; such as sour and heavy bread, 
cakes, pie-crust, and other dishes consisting of fat mixed 
and cooked with flour. Eancid butter and high-seasoned 
food are equally unwholesome. The fewer mixtures there 
are in cooking, the more healthful is the food likely to be. 

There is one caution as to the mode of editing which seems 
peculiarly needful to Americans. It is indispensable to good 



134 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

digestion, that food be well chewed and taken slowly. It 
needs to be thoroughly chewed and mixed with saliva, in 
order to prepare it for the action of the gastric jnice, which, 
by the peristaltic motion, will be thus brought into contact 
with every one' of the minute portions. It has been found 
that a solid lump of food requires much more time and lar 
bor of the stomach for digestion than divided substances. 

It has also been found, that as each bolus, or mouthful, 
enters the stomach, the latter closes, until the portion receiv- 
ed has had some time to move around and combine with the 
gastric juice, and that the orifice of the stomach resists the 
entrance of any more till this is accomplished. But, if the 
eater persists in swallowing fast, the stomach yields ; the food 
is then poured in more rapidly than the organ can perform 
its duty of preparative digestion ; and evil results are sooner 
or later developed. This exhibits the folly of those hasty 
meals, so common to travelers and to men of business, and- 
shows why children should be taught to eat slowly. 

After taking a full meal, it is very important to health 
that no great bodily or mental exertion be made till the 
labor of the stomach is over. Intense mental effort draws 
the blood to the head, and muscular exertions draw it to 
the muscles ; and in consequence of this, the stomach loses 
the supply which it requires when performing its office. 
When the blood with its stimulating effects is thus with- 
drawn from the stomach, the adequate supply of gastric 
juice is not afforded, and indigestion is the result. The 
heaviness which follows a full meal is the indication which 
Ifature gives of the need of quiet. "When the meal is mod- 
erate, a sufficient quantity of gastric juice is exuded in an 
hour, or an hour and a half ; after which, labor of body and 
mind may safely be resumed. 

When undigested food remains in the stomach, and is at 
last thrown out into the bowels, it proves an irritating sub- 
stance, producing an inflamed state in the lining of the sto- 
mach and other organs. 



HEALTHFUL FOOD. 135 

It is found that the stomacla has the power of gradually 
accommodating its digestive powers to the food it habitually 
receives. Thus, animals which live on vegetables can gra- 
dually become accustomed to animal food ; and the reverse 
is equally true. Thus, too, the human stomach can even- 
tually accomplish the digestion of some Idnds of food, which, 
at jBrst, were indigestible. 

But any changes of this sort should be gradual ; as those 
which are sudden are trying to the powers of the stomach, 
by furnishing matter for which its gastric juice is not pre- 
pared. 

Extremes of heat or cold are injurious to the process of 
digestion. Taking hot food or drink, habitually, tends to 
debilitate all the organs thus needlessly excited. In using 
cold substances, it is found that a certain degree of wannth 
in the stomach is indispensable to their digestion ; so that, 
when the gastric juice is cooled below this teiQperature, it 
ceases to act. Indulging ia large quantities of cold drinks, 
or eating ice-creams, after a meal, tends to reduce the tem- 
perature of the stomach, and thus to stop digestion. This 
shows the f bUy of those refreshments, ia convivial meetings, 
where the guests are tempted to load the stomach with a 
variety such as would require the stomach of a stout farmer 
to digest; and then to wind up with ice-creams, thus 
lessening whatever ability might otherwise have existed to 
digest the heavy load. The fittest temperature for drinks, 
if taken when the food is ia the digesting process, is blood 
heat. Cool drinks, and even ice, can be safely taken at 
other times, if not in excessive quantity. When the thirst 
is excessive, or the body weakened by fatigue, or when in a 
. state of perspiration, large quantities of cold drinks are in- 
jurious. 

Fluids taken into the stomach are not subject to the slow 
process of digestion, but are immediately absorbed and car- 
ried into the blood. This is the reason why liquid nourish- 
ment, more speedily than, solid food, restores from exhaastion. 



136 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S -MANUAL. 

The minute vessels of the stomach absorb its fluids, which 
are carried into the blood, just as the minute extremities of 
the arteries open upon the inner surface of the stomach, and 
there exude the gastric juice from the blood. 

When food is chiefly liquid, (soup, for example,) the fluid 
part is rapidly absorbed. The solid parts remain, to be act- 
ed on by the gastric juice. In the case of St. Martin,* in 
iifty minutes after taking soup, the fluids were absorbed, 
and the remainder was even thicker than is usual after eat- 
ing solid food. This is the reason why soups are deemed 
bad for weak stomachs ; as this residuum is more difficult of 
digestion than ordinary food. 

Highly-concentrated food, having much nourishment ia 
a small bulk, is not f avoraUe to digestion, because it can not 
be properly acted on by the muscular contractions of the 
stomach, and is not so minutely divided as to enable the 
gastric juice to act properly. This is the reason why a cer-- 
taia hulk of food is needful to good digestion; and why 
those people who live on whale-oil and other highly nou- 
rishing food, in cold climates, mix vegetables and even saw- 
dust with it to make it more acceptable and digestible. So 
in civilized lands, fruits and vegetables are mixed with more 
highly concentrated nourishment. For this reason also, 
soups, jellies, and arrow-root should have bread or crackers 
mixed with them. This aflfords another reason why coarse 
bread, of unbolted wheat, so often proves beneficial. "Where, 
from inactive habits or other causes, the bowels become con- 



* The individual here referred to— Alexis St. Martin — was a young 
Canadian, eighteen years of age, of a good constitution and robust health, 
who, in 1833, was accidentally wounded by the discharge of a musket which 
carried away a part of the ribs, lacerated one of the lobes of the lungs, 
and perforated the stomach, making a large aperture, which never closed ; 
and which enabled Dr. Beaumont (a surgeon of the American army, sta- 
tioned at Michilimackinac, under whose care the patient was placed) to 
witness all the processes of digestion and other functions of the bodv for 
several years. 



Blealthful food. 137 

stipated and sluggish, tMs kind of food proves the appro- 
priate remedy. 

One fact on tMs subject is worthy of notice. In Eng- 
land, under the administration of William Pitt, for two 
years or more there was such a scarcity of wheat that, to 
make it hold out longer, Parliament passed a law that 
the anny should have all tneir bread made of unbolted 
flour. The result was, that the health of the soldiers im- 
proved so much as to be a subject of surprise tcJ themselves, 
the officers, and the physicians. These last came out pub- 
licly and declared that the soldiers never before were so ro- 
bust and healthy ; and that disease had nearly disappeared 
from the army. The civic physicians joined and pronounced 
it the healthiest bread ; and for a time schools, families, and 
public institutions used it almost exclusively. Even the 
nobility, convinced by these facts, adopted it for their com- 
mon diet, and the fashion continued a long time after 
the scarcity ceased, until more luxurious habits resumed 
their sway. 

We thus see why children should not have cakes and can- 
dies allowed them between meals. Besides being largely 
carbonaceous, these are highly concentrated nourishments, 
and should be eaten with inore bulky and less nourishing 
substances. The most indigestible of all kinds of food are 
fatty and oily substances, if heated. It is on this account 
that pie-crust and articles boiled and fried in fat or butter 
are deemed not so healthful as other food. 

The following, then, may be put down as the causes of a 
debilitated constitution from the misuse of food. Eating 
too much, eating too often, eating too fast, eating food and 
condiments that are too stimulating, eating food that is too 
wa/rm or too cold, eating food that is highly concentrated, 
without a proper admixture of less nourishing matter, and 
eating hot food that is difficult of digestion.

HEALTHFUL DEINKB. 

There is no direction in wHch a woman more needs both 
scientific knowledge and moral force than in using her 
influence to control her family in regard to stimulating 
beverages. 

It is a point fuUy established by experience that the full 
development of the human body and the vigorous exercise 
of all its ftmctions can be secured without the use of stimu- 
lating drinks. It is, therefore, perfectly safe to bring up 
children never to use them, no hazard being incurred by 
such a course. 

It is also found by experience that there are two evils in- 
curred by the use of stimulating drinks. The first is, their 
positive effect on the human system. Their peculiarity con- 
sists in so exciting the nervous system that all the functions 
of the body are accelerated, and the fluids are caused to 
move quicker than at their natural speed. This mcreased 
motion of the animal fluids always produces an agreeable 
effect on the mind. The intellect is invigorated, the im- 
agination is excited, the spu-its are enlivened ; and these 
effects are so agreeable that all mankind, after having once 
experienced them, feel a great desire for their repetition. 

But' this temporary invigoration of the system is always 
followed by a diminution of the powers of the stimulated 
organs ; so that, though in all cases this reaction may not be 
perceptible, it is invariably the result. It may be set down 
as the unchangeable rule of physiology, that stimulating 
drinks deduct from the powers of the constitution in exact- 



BEALTMFUL DRINKS. 139 

I 

ly tlie proportion in whicli they operate to produce tempo- 
rary invigoration. 

The second eyil is the temptation which always attends 
the use of stimulants. Their effect on the system is so agree- 
able, and the evils resulting are so imperceptible and distant, 
that there is a constant tendency to increase such excitement 
both in frequency and power. And the more the system is 
thus reduced in strength, the more craving is the desire for 
that which imparts a temporary invigoration. This process 
of increasing debility and increasing craving for the stimu- 
lus that removes it, often goes to such an exti'eme that the 
passion is perfectly uncontrollable, and mind and body perish 
under this baleful habit. 

In this country there are three forms in which the use of 
Buch stimulants is common ; namely, alcoholic drinks, ojpi- 
um mixtures, and toiacco. These are all alike in the main 
peculiarity of imparting that extra stimulus to the system 
which tends to exhaust its powers. 

Multitudes in this nation are^ in the habitual use of some 
one of these stimulants ; and each person defends the indul- 
gence by certain arguments : 

First, that the desire for stimulants is a natural propensity 
implanted in man's nature, as is manifest from the universal 
tendency to such indulgences in every nation. From this, 
it is inferred that it is an innocent desire, which ought to be 
gratified to some extent, and that the aim should be to keep 
it within the limits of temperance, instead of attempting to 
exterminate a natural propensity. 

This is an argument which, if true, makes it equally pro- 
per for not only men, but women and children, to use opium, 
brandy, or tobacco as stimulating principles, provided they 
are used temperately. But if it be granted that perfect 
health and strength can be gained and secured without these 
stimulants, and that their peculiar .effect is to diminish the 
po.wer of the system in exactly the same proportion as they 
stimulate it, then there is no such thing as a temperate use, 



140 THE BOVSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

unless they are so diluted as to destroy any stimulating power j 
and in this form they are seldom desired. 

The other argument for their use is, that they are among 
the good things provided by the Creator for our gratifica- 
tion ; that, like all other blessings, they are exposed to abuse 
and excess ; and that we should rather seek to regulate their 
use than to banish them entirely. 

This argument is based on the assumption that they are, 
like healthful foods and drinks, necessary to life and health, 
and injurious only by excess. But this is not true ; for when- 
ever they are used in any such strength as to be a gratifica- 
tion, they operate to a greater or less extent as stimulants ; 
and to just such extent they wear out the powers of the 
constitution ; and it is abundantly proved that they are not, 
like food and drink, necessary to health. Such articles are 
designed for medicine and not for common use. There can 
be no argument framed to defend the use of one of them 
which will not justify women and children in most danger- 
ous iudulgences. 

There are some facts recently revealed by the microscope 
in regard to alcoholic drinks, which every woman should 
understand and regard. It has been shown in a previous 
chapter that every act of mind, either by thought, feeling, 
or choice, causes the destruction of certain cells in the brain 
and nerves. It now is proved by microscopic science* that 
the kiud of nutrition furnished to the brain by the blood to 
a certain extent decides future feelings, thoughts, and voli- 
tions. The cells of the brain not only abstract from the 
blood the healthf id nutrition, but also are affected in shape, 
size, color, and action by unsuitable elements in the blood. 
This is especially the case when alcohol is taken into the 
stomach, from whence it is always carried to the brain. The 
consequence is, that it affects the nature and action of the

wiiteron Microscopic Physiology. 



HEALTBFUL DRINKS. 141 

brain-cells, imtil a habit is foi-med which is automatic; that 
is, the' mind loses the power of controlling the brain in its 
development of thoughts, feelings, and choices as it would 
in the natural state, and is itself controlled by the brain. 
In this condition a real disease of the brain is created, called 
oino-mania, (see Glossary,) and the only remedy is total 
abstinence, and that for a long period, from the alcoholic 
poison. And what makes the danger more fearful is, that the 
brain-cells never are so renewed but that this pernicious 
etimiUus will bring back the disease in full force, so that a 
man once subject to it is never safe except by maintaining 
perpetual and total abstinence from every kind of alcoholic 
■drink. Dr. Day, who for many years has had charge of an 
inebriate asylum, states that he witnessed the dissection of tlie 
brain of a man once an inebriate, but for many years in 
practice of total abstinence, and found its cells still in 
the weak and unnatural state produced by earlier indul- 
gences. 

There has unfortunately been a difference of opinion 
among medical men as to the use of alcohol. Liebig, the 
■celebrated writer on animal chemistry, having found that 
both sugar and alcohol were heat-producing articles of food, 
framed a theory that alcohol is burnt in the lungs, giving 
off carbonic acid and water, and thus serving to warm the 
body. But modern science has proved that it is in the cap- 
illaries that animal heat is generated, and it is believed that 
alcohol lessens instead of increasing the power of the body to 
bear the cold. Sir John Eoss, in his Arctic voyage, proved 
by his own experience and that of his men that cold-Avater 
drinkers could bear cold longer and were stronger than any 
who used alcohol. 

Carpenter, a standard wi'iter on physiology, says the ob- 
jection to a habitual use of even small quantities of alcoholic 
drinks is, that " they ai-e universally admitted to possess a 
poisonous character," and-" tend to produce a morbid condi- 
tion of body;" while "the capacity forendm-ing extremes 



142 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

of lieat and cold, or of mental or bodily labor, is dimiaislied 
rather than increased by their habitual employment." 

Prof. J. Bigelow, of Harvard University, says, "Alcohol 
is highly stimulating, heating, and intoxicating, and its effects 
are so fascinating that when once experienced there is dan- 
ger that the desire for them may be perpetuated." 

Dr. Bell and Dr. Chiu-chill, both high medical authori- 
ties, especially in lung disease, for which whisky is often 
recommended, come to the conclusion that " the opinion that 
alcoholic liquors have influence in preventing the deposition 
of tubercle is destitute of any foundation ; on the contrary, 
then- use predisposes to tubercular deposition." And " where 
tubercle exists, alcohol has no effect in modifying the usual 
course, neither does it modify the morbid effects on the 
system." 

Prof. Toumans, of ISTew-Tork, says : " It has been demon- 
strated that alcoholic drinks prevent the natural changes 
in the blood, and obstraet the nutritive and reparative func- 
tions." He adds, " Chemical experiments have demonstrated 
that the action of alcohol on the digestive fluid is to destroy 
its active principle, the jpepsiw, thus confirming the observa- 
tions of physiologists, that its use gives rise to serious disor- 
ders of the stomach and malignant aberration of the whole 
economy." 

"We are now prepared to consider the great principles of 
science, common sense, and religion, which should guide 
every woman who has any kind of influence or responsibil- 
ity on 'this siibject. 

It is allowed by all medical men that pure water is per- 
fectly healthful and supplies all the liquid needed by the 
body ; and also that by proper means, which ordinarily are 
in the reach of all, water can be made sufficiently pure. 

It is allowed by all that milk, and the juices of fruits, when 
taken into the stomach, furnish water that is always pure, 
ar.d that our bread and vegetable food also supply it 
in large quantities. There are besides a great variety of 



HEALTHFUL DRINKS. 143 

agreeable and healtlifnl beverages, made from the juices of 
fruit, containing no alcohol, and agreeable drinks, such as 
milk, cocoa, and chocolate, that contain no stimulating prin- 
ciples, and ■which are nourishing and healthful. 

As one course, then, is perfectly safe and another in- 
volves great danger, it is -wrong and sinful to choose the 
path of danger. There is no peril in drinking pure water, 
milk, the juices of fruits, and infusions that are nom-ishing 
and harmless. But there is great danger to the yotmg, and 
to the commonwealth, in patronizing the sale and use of 
alcoholic di-inks. The religion of Christ, in its distinctive 
feature, involves generous self-denial for the good of others, 
especially for the weaker members of society. It is on this 
principle that St. Paul sets forth his own example, " If meat 
make n .y brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the 
world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend." And 
again he teaches, ""We, then, that are strong ought to 
bear the infii-mities of the weak, and not to please our- 
selves." 

This Christian principle also applies to the common drinks 
of the family, tea and coffee. . 

It has been shown that the great end for which Jesus 
Christ came, and for which he instituted the family state, 
is the training of our whole race to virtue and happiness, 
with cliief reference to an immortal existence. In this mis- 
sion, of which wom'an is chief minister, as before stated, the 
distinctive feature is self-sacrifice of the wiser and stronger 
members to save and to elevate the weaker ones. The chil- 
dren and the servants are these weaker members, who by 
ignorance and want of habits of self-control are in most 
danger. It is in this aspect that we are to consider the ex- 
pediency of using tea and coffee in a family. 

These drinks are a most extensive cause of much of the 
nervous debility and suffering endured by American women; 
and relinquishing them would save an immense amount of 
STJcli suffering. Moreover, aU housekeepers will allow that 



144 TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

they can not regulate these drinks m their kitchens, whore 
the ignorant use them to excess. There is little probability 
that the present generation will make so decided a change 
in their habits as to give up these beverages ; but the sub- 
ject is presented rather in reference to forming the -habits 
of children. 

It is a fact that tea and coffee are at first scld.om or never 
agreeable to children. It is the mixture of milk, sugar, and 
water, that reconciles them to a taste, which in this manner 
gradually becomes agreeable. Now suppose that those who 
provide for a family conclude that it is not their duty to 
give up entirely the use of stimiilating drinks, may not the 
case appear different in regard to teaching their children to 
love such drinks ? Let the matter bo regarded thus : The 
experiments of physiologists all prove that stimulants are 
not needful to health, and that, as the general rule, they tend 
to debilitate the constitution. Is it right, then, for a parent 
to tempt a child to drink what is not needful, when there 
is a probability that it will prove, to some extent, an under- 
minins; drain on the constitution ? Some constitutions can 
bear much less excitement than others ; and in every family 
of children, there is usually one or more of delicate organi- 
zation, and consequently peculiarly exposed to dangers from 
this source. It is this child who ordinarily becomes the vic- 
tim to stimulating drinks. The tea and coffee which the 
parents and the healthier children can use without immedi- 
ate injury, gradually sap the energies of the feebler child, 
who proves either an early victim or a living martyi- to all 
the sufferings that debilitated nerves inflict. Can it be right 
to lead children where all allow that there is some dancer, 
and where in many cases disease and death arc met, when 
another path is known to be perfectly safe ? 

The impression common in this country, that warm drinks, 
especially in winter, are more healthful than cold, is not 
warranted by any experience, nor by the laws of the physical 
system. At dinner, oold drinks are universal, and no one 



HEALTSFVL DBINKS. 145 

deems tliem iiijiu-ious. It is only at tlie otlier two meals 
tliat they are supposed to be Iiiutfiil. 

There is no doubt that warm drinks are healthful, and 
more agreeable than cold, at certain times and seasons ; but 
it is ej:pially true that drinks above blood-heat are not health- 
ful. If a person should bathe in warm water every day, 
debility would inevitably follow ; for the frequent applica- 
tion of the stimulus of heat, like all other stimulants, even- 
tually causes relaxation and weakness. If, therefore, a person 
is ill the habit of drinking hot drinks twice a day, the teeth, 
throat, and stomach arc gradually debilitated. This, most 
probably, is one of the causes of an early decay of the teeth, 
which is observed to be much more common among Ameri- 
can ladies, than among those in European coimtries. 

It has been stated to the writer, by an intelligent traveler 
who had visited Mexico, that it was rare to meet an indi- 
vidual with even a tolerable set of teeth, and tliat almost 
every grown person he met in the street had merely rem- 
nants of teeth. On inquiry into the customs of the country, 
it was found that it was the universal practice to take their 
usual beverage at almost the boiling-point ; and this doubt- 
less was the chief ca\ise of the almost entire want of teeth 
in that country. In the United States, it can not be doubted 
that much evil is done in this way by hot drinks. Most tea-, 
drinkers consider tea as ruined if it stands until it reaches 
the healthful temperature for drink. 

The following extract, from Dr. Andrew Combe, presents 
the opinion of most intelligent medical men on this sub- 
ject.* 

" Water is a safe drink for all constitutions, provided it 
be resorted to in obedience to the dictates of natm-al thirst

only, and not of habit. Unless the desire for it is felt, there 
is no occasion for its use during a meal." 

" The primary effect of all distilled and fermented liqaofs 
is to stimulate the nervous system and qxdclcen the circula- 
tion. In infancy and childhood, the circulation is rapid and 
easily excited ; and the nervous system is strongly acted 
upon even by the slightest external impressions. Hence, slight 
causes of irritation readily excite febrile and convulsive dis- 
orders. In youth, the natural tendency of the constitution 
is still to excitement, and consequently, as a general rule, the 
stimulus of fermented liquors is injurious." 

These remarks show that parents, who find that stimulating 
drinks are not injm-ious to themselves, may mistake in in- 
ferring from this that they will not be injurious to their 
children. 

Dr. Combe continues thus : " In mature age, when diges- 
tion is good, and the system in full vigor, if the mode of life 
be not too exhausting, the nervous functions and general 
circulation are in their best condition, and require no stim- 
ulus for their support. The bodily energy is then easily 
sustained by nutritious food and a regular regimen, and 
consequently artificial excitement only increases the wasting 
of the natm-al strength." 

It may be asked, in this connection, why the stimulus of 
animal food is not to be regarded in the same light as that 
of stimulating drinks. In reply, a very essential difference 
may be pointed out. Animal food furnishes nutriment to 
the organs which it stimulates, but stimulating drinks excite 
the organs to quickened action without affording any nou- 
rislunent. 

It has been supposed by some that tea and coffee have, at 
least, a degree of nom-ishing power. But it is proved that 
it is the milk and sugar, and not the main portion of the 
drink, which imparts the nourishment. Tea has not one 
particle of nourishing properties ; and what little exists in 
the coffee-beiTy is lost by roasting it in the usual mode. All 



HEALTSFVL DRINKS. 147 

that these articles do, is simply to stimulate without nou- 
rishing. 

Altliough there is little hope of banishing these drinks, 
there is still a chance that soinething may be gained in at- 
tempts to regulate their use by the rules of temperance. 
If, then, a housekeeper can not banish tea and coffefe en- 
tirely, she may use her influence to prevent excess, both by 
her instructions, and by the power of control committed 
more or less to her hands. 

It is important for every housekeeper to know that the 
health of a family very much depends on \!a.Q f\i,rity of wa- 
ter used for cooking and drinking. There are three causes 
of impm'e and unhealthf ul water. One is, the existence in 
it of vegetable or animal matter, which can be remedied by 
filtering through sand and charcoal. Another cause is, the 
existence of mineral matter, especially in limestone coun- 
tries, producing diseases of the bladder. This is remedied 
in a measm-^ by boiling, which secures a deposit of the lime 
on the vessel used. The third cause is, the corroding of zinc 
and lead used in pipes and reservoirs, producing oxides that 
are slow poisons. The only remedy is prevention, by having 
sujiply-pipes made of iron, like, gas-pipe, instead of zinc and 
lead ; or the lately invented lead pipe lined with tin, which 
metal is not corrosive. The obstacle to this is, that the trade 
of the plumbers would be greatly diminished by the use of 
reliable pipes. When Water must boused from supply-pipes 
of lead or zinc, it is well to let the water run some time be- 
fore drinking it and to use as little as possible, taking milk 
instead ; and being further satisfied for inner necessities by 
the water supplied by fruits and vegetables. The water in 
these is always pure. But in using milk as a drink, it must 
be remembered that it is also rich food, and that less of 
other food must be taken when milk is thus used, or bUiona 
troubles will result from excess of food. 

The use of opium, especially by women, is usually caused 
at first by medical prescriptions containing it. All that has 



148 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

been stated as to the effect of alcohol in the brain is true oi 
opium ; while, to break a habit thus induced is almost hopeless. 
Every woman who takes or who administers this drug, is deal- 
ing as with poisoned arrows, whose wounds are without cure. 

The use of tobacco in this country, and especially among 
young boys, is increasing at a fearful rate. On this subject, 
wc have the unanimous opinion of all medical men ; the fol- 
lowing being specimens. 

A distingifished medical writer thus states the case : " Every 
p]iysician knows that the agreeable sensations that tempt 
to the use of tobacco are caused by nicotine, which is a rank' 
poison, as much so as prussic acid or arsenic. Wlien smoked, 
the poison is absorbed by the blood of the mouth, and car- 
ried to the brain. Wlien chewed, the nicotine passes to the 
blood through the mouth and stomach. In both cases, the 
whole nervous system is thrown into abnormal excitement to 
expel the poison, and it is this excitement that causes agree- 
able sensations. The excitement thus caused is invariably 
followed by a duninution of nervous power, in exact pro- 
portion to the preceding excitement to expel the evil from the 
system." 

Few will dispute the general truth and effect of the 
above statement, so that the question is one to be settled on 
the same principle as applies to the use of alcoholic drinks. 
Is it, tlicn,. according to the generous iDrinciples of Christ's 
religion, for those who are strong and able to bear this poison, 
to tempt the young, the ignorant, and the weak to a prac- 
tice not needful to any healthful enjoyment, and which leads 
multitudes to disease, and often to vice ? For the use of 
tobacco tends always to lessen nerve-power, and probably 
every one out of five that indulges in its use awakens ^ mor- 
bid craving for increased stimulus, lessens the power of 
self-control, diminishes the strength of the constitution, and 
sets an example that influences the weak to the path of 
danger and of frequent ruin. 

The great danger of this age is an increasing, intense

worldliness, and disbelief in the foundation pi-inciple of tlie

ages the consequences of habits formed in this life. In the 
light of his word, they only Avho arc truly wise " shall shine

which alone can save our country and the world from that 
inrushin2; tide of sensualism and worldliness, now secminn: 
to threaten the best hopes and prospects of our race. 

And woman, as the chief educator of our race, and the 
prime minister of the family state, is bound in tlie use of 
meats and drinks to employ the powerful and distinctive 
motives of the religion of Clirist in forming habits of tem- 
perance and benevolent self-sacrifice for the good of others.

CLEANLINESS. 



Fig. 67. 



Both tlie healtli and comfort of a family depend, to a 
great extent, on cleanliness of the person and the family 
surroundings. True cleanliness of person involves the sci- 
entific treatment of the skin. This is the most complicated 
organ of the body, and one through which the health is af- 
fected more than through any other ; and no persons can or 
will be so likely to take proper care of it as those by whom 
its construction and functions are understood. 

Fig. 57 is a very highly 
magnified portion of the 
skin. The layer marked 
1 is the outside, very thin 
skin, called the cuticle or 
scarf shin. , This consists 
of transparent layers of 
minute cells, which are 
constantly decaying and 
being renewed, and the 
white scurf that passes 
from the skin to the cloth- 
ing is a decayed portion of 
these cells. This part of the skin has neither nerves nor 
blood-vessels. 

The dark layer, marked 2, 7, 8, is that portion of the true 
skin which gives the external color marking diverse races. 
In the portion of the dark layer marked 3, 4, is seen a net- 
work of nerves which run from two branches of the nervous

trunks coming from the spinal marrow. These are nerves 
of sensation, by which the sense of touch or feeling is per- 
formed. Fig. 58 represents the 
blood-vessels, (intermingled with 
the nerves of the skin,) which 
divide iato minute capillaries, 
that act like the capillaries of 
the lungs, taking oxygen from 
the air, and giving out carbonic 
acid. At a and h are seen the 
roots of two hairs, which abound 
in certain parts of the skin, and 
are nourished by the blood of 
the capillaries. 
At Fig. 69 is a magnified view 
of another set of vessels, called the lyTivphatios or absorl- 
ents. These are extremely minute vessels that interlace 
with the nerves and blood-vessels of the skin. Their ofiSce 
is to aid in collecting the use- 
less, injurious, or decayed mat- 
ter, and carry it to certain re- 
servoirs, from which it passes 
into some of the large veins, to 
be thrown out through the 
limgs, bowels, kidneys, or skin. 
These absorbent or lymphatic 
vessels have mouths opening 
on the sm-f ace of the true skin, 
and, though covered by the 

cuticle, they can absorb both liquids and solids that are 
placed in close contact with the skin. In proof of this, one 
of the main trunks ol the lymphatics in the hand can be 
cut off from all communication with other portions, and tied 
up : and if the hand is immersed in milk a given time, it 
will be found that the milk has been absorbed through the 
cuticle and fills the lymphatics. In this way, long-con-

tinued blisters on the skin will introduce the blistering mat- 
ter into the blood through the absorbents, and then the kid- 
neys will take it up from the blood passing through them t» 
cany it out of the body, and thus become irritated and in- 
flamed by it. 

There are also oil-tubes, imbedded in the skin, that draw 
ofi" oil from the blood. This issues on the surface and spreads 
over the cuticle to keep it soft and moist. 

But the most curious part of the skin 
is the system of innumerable minute 
perspiration-tubes. Fig. 60 is a draw- 
ing of one very greatly magnified. 
These tubes open on the cuticle, and 
the openings are called pores of the 
skin. They descend into the true skin, 
and thei-e form a coil, as is seen in the 
drawing. These tubes are hollow, like 
a pipe-stem, and their inner surface 
consists of wonderfully minute capilla- 
ries filled with the impure venous 
blood. And in these small tubes the 
same process is going on as takes place 
when the carbonic £!,cid and water of 
the blood are exhaled from the lungs. 
The capillaries of these tubes through 
the whole skin of the body are thus 
constantly exhaling the noxipus and decayed particles of 
the body, just as the lungs pour them out through the 
mouth and nose. 

It has been shown that the perspiration-tubes are coiled 
up into a ball at their base. The number and extent of 
these tubes are astonishing. ' In a square inch on the palm 
of the hand have been counted, through a microscope, thir- 
ty-five hundred of these tubes. Each one of them is about 
a quarter of an inch in length, including its coils. This 
makes the united lengths of these little tubes to be seventy- 




CLEANLINESS. 153 

three feet to a square incli. Tlieir united length over the 
whole body is thus calculated to be equal to twenty-eight 
iniles. What a wonderful apparatus this ! And what mis- 
chiefs must ensue when the drainage from the body of such 
an extent as this becomes obstructed ! 

But the inside of the body also has a skin, as have all its 
organs. The interior of the head, the throat, the gullet, the 
lungs, the stomach, and all the intestines, are lined with a 
skiu. This is called the mucous memirane, because it is 
constantly secreting from the blood a slimy substance called 
mucus. AVhen it accmnulates in the lungs, it is called^/iZe^OT. 
This inner skin also has nerves, blood-vessels, and lymphatics. 
The outer skin joins to the inner at the mouth, the nose, and 
other oiJenings of the body, and there is a constant sjTnpathy 
between the two sldns, and thus between the inner organs 
and the sm-facc of the body. 

SECEETING OEGANS. 

Those vessels of the body which draw off certain portions 
of the blood and change it into a new f onn, to be employed 
for sei-vice or to be thrown out of the body, are called se- 
<yreting organs. The skin in this sense is a secreting organ, 
as its perspii-ation-tubes secrete or separate the bad portions 
of the blood, and send them off. 

Of the internal secreting organs, the liver is the largest. 
Its chief office is to secrete from the blood all matter not 
properly supplied with oxygen. For this purpose, a set of 
veins carries the blood of all the lower intestines to the liver, 
where the imperfectly oxidized matter is drawn off in the 
form of lile, and accumulated in a reservoir called the 
gall-Uadder. Thence it passes to the place where the 
smaller intestines receive the food from the stomach, and 
there it mixes with this food. Then it passes through the 
long intestines, and is thrown out of the body through the 
rectum. This shows how it is, that want of pure and cool 



154 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

air and exercise causes excess of bile, from lack of oxygen. 
The liver also has arterial blood sent to nourish it, and cor- 
responding veins to return this blood to the heart. So there 
are two sets of blood-vessels for the liver — one to secrete the 
bile, and the other to nourish the organ itself. 

The kidneys secrete from the arteries that pass through 
them all excess of water in the blood, and certain injurious 
substances. These are carried through small tubes to the 
bladder, and thence thrown out of the body. 

The pancreas, a whitish gland, situated in the abdomen 
below the stomach, secretes from the arteries that pasa 
through it the pancreatic juice, which unites with the bile 
from the liver, in preparing the food for nourishing the 
body. 

There are certain little glands near the eyes that secrete 
the tears, and others near the mouth that secrete the saliva, 
or spittle. 

These organs all have arteries sent to them to nourish 
them, and also veins to carry away the impure blood. At 
the same time, they secrete from the arterial blood the pe- 
culiar fluid which it is their office to supply. 

All the food that passes through the lower intestines 
which is not drawn off by the lacteals or by some of these 
secreting organs, passes from, the body through a passage 
called the rectum. 

Learned men have made very curious experiments to as- 
certain how much the several organs throw out of the body, 
It is found that the skin throws off five out of eight pounds 
of the food and drink, or probably about three or four 
pounds a day. The lungs throw off one quarter as much 
as the skin, or about a pound a day. The remainder is 
carried off by the kidneys and lower intestines. 

There is such a sympathy and connection between all the 
organs of the body, that when one of them is unable to 
work, the others perform the office of the feeble one. 
Thus, if the skin has its perspiration-tubes closed up by a 



CLBANLINJESS. 155 

chill, then all the poisonous matter that would have been 
thrown out through them must be emptied out either by 
the lungs, kidneys, or bowels. 

"When all these organs are strong and healthy, they can 
bear this increased labor without injury. But if the lunga 
are weak, the blood sent from the skin by the chill engor- 
ges the weak blood-vessels, and produces an inflammation 
of the lungs. Or it increases the discharge of a slimy mu- 
cous substance, that exudes from the skin of the lunss. 
This fills up the aii'-vessels, and would very soon end life, 
were it not for the spasms of the lungs, called coughing, 
which throw off this substance. ^ 

If, on the other hand, the bowels are weak, a chill of the 
sMn sends the blood into all the blood-vessels of the intes- 
tines, and produces inilammation there, or else an excessive 
secretion of the mucous substance, which is called a diar- 
rhea. Or. if the kidneys are weak, there is an increased se- 
cretion and discharge from them, to an unhealthy and in- 
jurious extent. 

This connection between the skin and internal organs is 
shown, not only by the internal effects of a chill on the skin ; 
but by the sympathetic effect on the skin when these internal 
organs suffer. For example, there are some kinds of food 
that will irritate and influence the stomach or the bowels ; 
and this, by sympathy, will produce an immediate -eruption on 
the skin. Some persons, on eating strawberries, will imme- 
diately be affected with a nettle-rash. Others can not oat 
certain shell-fish without being affected in this way. Many 
humors on the face are caused by a diseased state of the 
internal organs with which the skin sympathizes. 

This short accoimt of the construction of the skin, and 
of its intimate connection with the internal, organs, shows 
the philosophy of those modes of medical treatment that are 
addressed to this portion of the body. 

It is on this powerful agency that the steam-doctors rely, 
when, by moisture and heat, they stimulate all the innu

merablc pei-spiration-tnbos and Ijanpliatics to force out 
from the bod}'- a flood of unnaturally excited secretions; 
while it is " kill or cure," jnst as the chance may meet or 
oppose the demands of the case. It is the skin also that is 
the chief basis of medical treatment in the "Water Ciu-c, 
whose slow processes are as mnch safer as they are slower. 

At the same time it is the ill-treatment or neglect of the 
skin Avhich, probably, is the cause of disease and decay 
to an incredible extent. The various particulars in which, 
this may bo seen will now be pointed out. In the man- 
agement and care of this wonderfiil and complex part of 
the body, many mistakes have been made. 

The most common one is the misuse of the bath, especially 
since cold water cm-es have come into use. This mode of 
medical treatment originated with an ignorant peasant, amid 
a population where oiitdoor labor had strengthened nerves 
and muscles and imparted rugged powers to every part of the 
body. It was then introduced into England and America 
witlioiit due consideration or knowledge of the diseases, 
habits, or real condition of patients, especially of w'omen. 
The consequence was a mode of treatment too severe and 
exhausting ; and many practices were spread fibroad not 
warranted by true medical science. 

But in spite of these mistakes and abuses, the treatment 
of the skin for disease by the use of cold water has become 
an accepted doctrine of the most learned medical practi- 
tioners. It is now held by all such that fevers can be de- 
tected in their distinctive featiu"es by the thermometer, and 
that all fevers can be reduced by cold baths and packing in 
the wet sheet, in the mode employed in all water-em-es. Di- 
rections for using this method will bo given in another place. 

It has been supposed that large bath-tubs for immersing 
the whole person are indispensable to the proper cleaning of 
the sldn. This is not so. A wet towel, applied every morn- 
ing to the skin, followed by friction in pure air, is all that 
is absolutely needed ; although a full bath is a great luxury. 



CLEANLINESS. 157 

A-ccess of air to every part of the skin when its perspiratory 
tubes are cleared and its blood-vessels are filled by friction 
is the best ordinary bath. 

In early life, children should be washed all over, every 
night or morning, to remove impurities from the skin. But 
m this process, careful regard should be paid to the peculiar 
constitution of a child. Very nervous children sometimes 
revolt from cold water, and like a tepid bath. Others pre- 
fer a cold bath ; and nature should be the guide. It must be 
remembered that the skin is the great organ of sensation, and 
in close connection with brain, spine, and nerve-centres : so 
that what a strong nervous system can bear with advantage 
is too powerful and exhausting for another. As age advances, 
or as disease debilitates the body, gi'eat care should be taken 
not to overtax the nervous system by sudden shocks, or to 
diminish its powers by withdrawing animal heat to excess. 
Persons lacking robustness should bathe or use friction in 
a warm room ; and if very delicate, should expose only a 
portion of the body at once to cold air. 

Johnson, a celebrated writer on agricultural chemistry, 
tells of an experiment by friction on the skia of pigs, whose 
skins are like that of the hiunan race. He treated six of 
these animals with a curry-comb seven weeks, and left three 
other pigs imtouched. The result was a gain of thirty-three 
poimds more of weight, with the use of five bushels less of 
food for those cmTied, than for the neglected ones. This 
result was caving to the fact that all the functions of the 
body were more perfectly performed when, by friction, the 
skin was kept free from filth and the blood in it exposed to 
the air. The same will be true of the human skin. A cal 
culation has been made on this fact, by which it is estima- 
ted that a man, by proper care of his skin, would save over 
thirty-one dollars in food yearly, which is the interest on 
over five hundred dollars. If men will give as much care 
to their own sldn as they give to currying a horse, they will 
gain both health and wealth.

CLOTHING. 

Theee is no duty of those persons having control of a 
family where principle and practice are more at variance 
than in regulating the dress of young girls, especially at 
the most important and critical period of life. It is a dif- 
ficult duty for parents and teachers to contend with the 
power of fashion, which at this time of a young girl's life is 
frequently the ruling thought, and when to be out of the 
fashion, to be odd and not dress as all her companions do, 
is a mortification and grief that no argument or instructions 
can relieve. The mother is often so overborne that, in spite 
of her better wishes, the daughter adopts modes of dress 
alike ruinous to health and to beauty. 

The greatest protection against such an emergency is to 
train a child to understand the construction of her own 
body and to impress upon her, in early days, her obliga- 
tions to the invisible Friend and Guardian of her life, the 
" Former of her body and the Father of her spirit," who has 
committed to her care so precious and beautiful a casket. 
And the more she can be made to realize the skill and 
beauty of construction shown in her earthly frame, the 
more wiU she feel the obligation to protect it from injury 
and abuse. 

It is a singular fact that the war of fashion has attacked 
most fatally what seems to be the strongest foundation and 
defense of the body, the bones. For this reason, the con- 
struction and functions of this part of the body wiU now 
receive attention. 

The bones are composed of two substances, one animal. 



CLOTHme. 159 

« 

aud the other mineral. The animal part is a very fine 
network, called cellular membrane. In this are deposited 
the harder mineral substances, which are composed princi- 
pally of carbonate and phosphate of Hme. In very early 
Hfe, the bones consist chiefly of the animal part, and are 
then soft and pliant. As the child advances in age, the 
bones grow harder, by the gradual deposition of the phos- 
phate of lime, which is supplied by the food, and carried to 
the bones by the blood. In old age, the hardest material 
preponderates ; making the bones more brittle than in ear- 
lier Hfe. 

The bones are covered with a thin sldn or membrane, 
filled with small -blood-vessels which convey nourishment 
to them. 

Where the bones unite with others to form joints, they 
are covered with cartilage, which is a smooth, white, elas- 
tic substance. This enables the joints to move smoothly, 
while its elasticity prevents injuries from sudden jars. 

The joints are bound together by strong, elastic bands 
called ligaments, which hold them firmly and prevent dis- 
location. 

Between the ends of the bones that unite to form joints 
are small sacks or bags, that contain a soft lubricating fluid. 
This answers the same purpose for the joints as oil in mak- 
ing machinery work smoothly, while the supply is constant 
and always in exact proportion to the demand. 

If you will examine the leg of some fowl, you can see tlie 
cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints, 
and the strong white ligaments that bind the joints toge- 
ther. 

The health of the bones depends on the proper nourish- 
ment and exercise of the body as much as that of any other 
part. When a child is feeble and unhealthy, or when it 
grows up without exercise, the bones do not become flrm 
and hard as they are when the body is healthfully devel- 
oped by exercise. The size as well as the strength of the 



160 



THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 



Fig. 61. 




bones, to a certain extent, also depend upon exercise and 
good health. 

The chief supporter of the body is the spine, which con- 
sists of twenty-four small bones, interlocked or hooked into 
each other, while between them are elastic cushions of car- 
tilage which aid in preserving the 
upright, natural position. Fig. 61 
shows three of the spinal bones, 
hooked into each other, the dark 
spaces showing the disks or flat cir- 
cular plates of cartilage between 
them. 

The spine is held in its proper 
position, partly by the ribs, partly by 
muscles, partly by aid of the eliastic • 
disks, and partly by the close pack- 
ing of the intestines in front of it. 
The upper part of the spine is often thrown out of its 
proper position by constant stooping of the head over books 
or work. This aflfects the elastic disks so that they grow 
thick at the back side and thinner at the front side by such 
constant pressure. The result is the awkward projection 
of the head forward which is often seen in schools and col- 
leges. 

Another distortion of the spine is produced by tight dress 
around the waist. The liver occupies the right side of the 
body and is a solid mass, while on the other side is the larger 
part of the stomach, which is often empty. The conse- 
quence of tight dress around the waist is a constant pres- 
sure of the spine toward the unsupported part where the 
stomach lies. Thus the elastic disks again are compressed ; 
till they become thinner on one side than the other, and 
harden into that condition. This produces what is called 
the lateral curvature of the spine, making one shoulder 
higher than the other. 

The compression of the lower part of the waist is especial- 



CLOTHING. 161 

ly dangerous at the time young girls first enter society and 
are tempted to dress according to the fashion. Many a 
school-girl, whose waist was originally of a proper and 
healthful size, has gradually pressed the soft bones of 
youth until the lower ribs that should rise and fall with 
every breath, become entirely unused. Then the abdomi- 
nal breathing, performed by the lower part of the lungs, 
ceases ; the whole system becomes reduced in strength ; 
the abdominal muscles that hold up the interior organs be- 
come weak, and the upper ones gradually sink upon the lower. 

This pressure of the upper interior organs upon the lower 
ones, by tight dress, is increased by the weight of clothing 
resting on the hips and abdomen. Corsets, as usually worn, 
have no support from the shoulders, and consequently all 
the weight of dress resting upon or above them presses 
upon the hips and abdomen, and this in such a way as to 
thi'ow out of use and thus weaken the most important sup- 
porting muscles of the abdomen, and impede abdominal 
breathing. 

The diaphragm is a kind of muscular floor, extending 
across the centre of the body, on which the heart and lungs 
rest. Beneath it are the Hver, stomach, and the abdomi- 
nal viscera, or intestines, which are supported by the abdo- 
minal muscles, running upward, downward, and crosswise. 
When these muscles are thrown out of use, they lose their 
power, the whole system of organs mainly resting on them 
for support can not continue in their naturally snug, compact, 
and rounded form, but become separated, elongated, and un- 
supported. The stomach begins to draw from above instead 
of resting on the viscera beneath. This in some cases causes 
dull and wandering pains, a sense of pulling at the centre 
of the chest, and a drawing downward at the pit of the 
stomach. Then as the support beneath is really gone, there 
is what is often called "a feeling of goneness." This is 
sometimes relieved by food, which, so long as it remains in 
a solid form, helps to hold up the falling superstructure. 



162 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

This displacement of tlie stomach, liver, and spleen inter- 
rupts their healthful functions, and dyspepsia and biliary 
difficulties not unfrequently are the result. , 

As the stomach and its appendages fall downward, the 
diaphragm, which holds up the heart and lungs, must des- 
cend also. In this state of things, the inflation of the lungs is 
less and less aided by the abdominal muscles, and is con- 
fined chiefly to their upper portion. ' Breathing sometimes 
thus becomes quicker and shorter on account of the elon- 
gated or debilitated condition of the assisting organs. Con 
sumption not unfrequently results from this cause. 

The heart also feels the evil. "Palpitations," "flutter- 
ings," " sinking feelings," all show that, in the language of 
Scripture, " the heart trembleth, and is moved out of its 
place." 

But the lower intestines are the greatest suflerers from 
this dreadful abuse of nature. Having the weight of all 
the unsupported organs above pressing them into unnatural 
and distorted positions, the passage of the food is inter- 
rupted, and inflammations, indurations, and constipation 
are the frequent result. Dreadful ulcers and cancers may 
be traced in some instances to this cause. 

Although these internal displacements are most common 
among women, some foolish members of the other sex are 
adopting customs of dress, in girding the central portion of 
the body, that tend to similar results. 

But this distortion brings upon woman peculiar distresses. 
The pressure of the whole superincumbent mass on the 
pelvic or lower organs induces sufFerings proportioned in 
acuteness to the extreme delicacy and sensitiveness of the 
parts thus crushed. And the intimate connection of these 
organs with the brain and whole nervous system renders in- 
juries thus inflicted the causes of the most extreme anguish, 
both of body and mind. This evil is becoming so com- 
mon, not only among married women, but among young 
girls, as to be a just cause for universal alarm. 



CLOTEINO. 163 

How very common these sufferings are, few but the medi- 
cal profession can realize, because they are troubles that 
must be concealed. Many a woman is moving about in un- 
complaining agony who, with any other trouble involving 
■equal suffering, would be on her bed suiTounded by sym- 
pathizing friends. 

The terrible sufferings that are sometimes thus induced 
can never bo conceived of, or at all appreciated from, any 
use of language. Nothing that the public can be made to 
believe on this subject will ever equal the reality. Not 
only mature persons and mothers, but fair young girls some- 
times, are shut up for months and years as helpless and 
suffering invalids from this cause. This may be found all 
over the land. And there frequently is a horrible extremity 
of suffering in certain forms of this evil, which no woman 
of feeble constitution can ever be certain may not be her 
doom. Not that in all cases this extremity is involved, but 
none can say who will escape it. 

In regard to this, if one must choose for a friend or a 
child, on the one hand, the horrible torments inflicted by 
savage Indians or cmel inquisitors on their victims, or, on 
the other, the protracted agonies that result from such de- 
formities and displacements, sometimes the fcN-mer would 
be a merciful exchange. 

And yet this is the fate that is coming to meet the young 
as weU as the mature in every direction. And tender 
parents are unconsciously leading their lovely and hapless 
daughters to this awful doom. 

There is no excitement of the imagination in what is hero 
indicated. If the facts and details could be presented, they 
would send a groan of terror all over the land. For it is 
not one class, or one section, that is endangered. In every 
part of our country the evil is progressing. 

And, as if these dreadful ills were not enough, there have 
been added methods of medical treatment at once useless, tor- 
turing to the mind, and involving great liability to immorali- 
ties.

THE HOXfSEKEEPEB'S MANUAL. 




In hope of abating these evils, drawings are given (Fig. 

62 and Fig. 63) of the front and back of a jacket that will 

preserve the advantages of 
^'s- ^^ the corset without its evils. 

This jacket may at first be 
fitted to the figure with cor- 
sets underneath it, just like 
the waist of a dress. Then, 
delicate whalebones can be 
used to stiffen the jacket, so 
that it will take the proper' 
shape, when the corset may 
be dispensed with. The but- 
tons below are to hold all 

articles of dress below the waist by buttpn-holes. Ey this 

method, the bust is supported as well as by corsets, while 

the shoulders support from above, as they should do, the 

weight of the dress below. No stiff bone should be allowed 

to press in front, and the jacket should be so loose that a 

full breath can be inspired with ease, while in a sitting 

position. 

The proper way to dress a young girl is to have a cotton 

or flannel close-fitting jacket 

next the body, to which the 

drawers should be buttoned. 

Over this, place the chemise; 

and over that, such a jacket 

as the one here drawn, to 

which should be buttoned the 

hoops and other skirts. Thus 

every article of dress will be 

supported by the shoulders. 

The sleeves of the jacket can 

be omitted, and in that case a 

strong lining, and also a tape binding, must surround the 

arm-hole, which should be loose.

CLOTHING. 165 

It is hoped that increase of intelligence and moral poTver 
among mothers, and a combination among them to regulate 
fashions, may banish the pernicious practices that have pre- 
vailed. If a school-girl dress without corsets and without 
tight belts could be established as a fashion, it woiild be 
one step gained in the right dii-ection. Then if mothers 
could secure daily domestic exercise in chambers, eating- 
rooms and parlors in loose dresses, a still farther advance 
would be secm-ed. 

A friend of the wi'iter informs her that her daughter had 
her wedding outfit made up by a fashionable milliner in 
Paris, and every di-ess was beautifully fitted to the form, 
and yet was not compressing to any part. This was done 
too without the use of corsets, the stiffening being delicate 
and yielding whalebones. 

Not only parents but all having the care of young girls, 
especially those at boarding-schools, have a fearful responsi- 
bility resting upon them in regard to this important duty. 

In regard to the dressing of young children, much discre- 
tion is needed to adapt dress to circumstances and peculiar 
constitutions. The leading fact must be borne in mind that 
the skin is made strong and healthful by exposure to light and 
pure air, while cold au", if not excessive, has a tonic infiuence. 
If the shin of infants is rubbed with the hand till red with 
blood, and then exposed naked to sun and air in a well-ven- 
tilated room, it will' be favorable to health. 

There is a constitutional difference in the skin of different 
childi'en in regard to retaining the animal heat manufactur- 
ed within, so that some need more clothing than others for 
comfort. Nature is a safe guide to a careful nurse and 
mother, and will indicate by the looks and actions of a child 
when more clothing is needful. As a general rule, it is 
safe for a healthful child to wear as little clothing as suffi- 
ces to keep it from complaining of cold. Fifty years ago, 
it was not common for children to wear as much under-cloth- 
ing as they now do. The writer well remembers how even 



166 THE BUUtSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

girls, tho ugh not of strong constitutions, used to play for houn 
in the snow-drifts without the protection of drawers, kept 
warm by exercise and occasional runs to an open fire. And 
multitudes of children grew to vigorous maturity through 
similar exposures to cold air-baths, and without the frequent 
colds and sicknesses so common among children of the 
present day, who are more carefully housed and warmly 
dressed. But care was taken that the feet should be kei)t 
dry and warmly clad, because, circulation being feebler in 
the extremities, this precaution was important. 

It must also be considered that age brings with it decrease 
in vigor of circulation, and the consequent generation of 
heat, so that more warmth of air and clothing is needed at 
an advanced period of life than is suitable for the young. 

These are the general principles which must be applied 
with modification to each individual case. A child of deli- 
cate constitution must have more carefid protection from 
cold air than is desirable for one more vigorous, while the 
leading general principle is retained that cold air is a health- 
ful tonic for the skin whenever it does not produce an un- 
comfortable chilliness.

GOOD COOKING. 

Thjee are but a few things on which health and happi- 
ness depend more than on the manner in which food ia 
cooked. Ton may make houses enchantingly beautiful, 
hang them with pictures, have them clean and airy and con- 
venient; but if the stomach is fed with sour bread and 
burnt meats, it will raise such rebellions that the eyes will 
see no beauty anywhere. The abundance of splendid ma- 
terial we have in America is in great contrast with the 
style of cooking most prevalent in our country. How often, 
in journeys, do we sit down to tables loaded with material, 
originally of the very best kind, which has been so spoiled 
in the treatment that there is really nothing to eat 1 Green 
biscuits with acrid spots of alkali ; sour yeast-bread ; meat 
slowly simmered in fat till it seemed like grease itself, and 
slowly congealing in cold grease ; and above all, that un- 
pardonable enormity, strong butter! How one longs to 
show people what might have been done with the raw ma- 
terial out of which all these monstrosities were concocted ! 

There is no country where an ample, well-furnished table 
is more easily spread, and for that reason, perhaps, none 
where the bounties of Providence are more generally ne- 
glected. Considering that our resources are greater than 
those of any other civilized people, our results are compara 
tively poorer. 

It is said that a list of the summer vegetables which are 
exhibited on New-York hotel-tables being shown to a French 
oHiste, he declared that to serve such a dinner properly 



168 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

would take till midniglit. A traveler can not but be struck 
with oui- national plenteousness, on retui-ning from a Con- 
tinental toui', and going directly from the ship to a New- 
York hotel, in the bounteous season of autumn. For 
months habituated to neat little bits of chop or poultry, 
garnished with the inevitable cauliflower or potato, which 
seemed to be the sole possibility after the reign of green 
peas was over ; to sit down aU at once to such a carnival ! tO' 
such ripe, juicy tomatoes, raw or cooked ; cucumbers in brittle 
slices; rich, yellow sweet-potatoes; broad lima-beans, and 
beans of other and various names; tempting ears of Indian- 
corn steaming in enormous piles ; great smoking tureens of 
the savory succotash, an Indian gift to the table for which 
civilization need not blush ; sliced egg-plant in delicate frit- 
ters ; and marrow-squashes, of creamy pulp and sweetness ; 
a rich variety, embanrassing to the appetite, and perplexing 
to the choice. 

Verily, the thought must often occur that the vegetarian 
doctrine pre~ached in America leaves a man quite as much 
as he has capacity to eat or enjoy, and that in the midst of 
such tantalizing abimdance he has really lost the apology, 
which elsewhere bears him out in preying upon his less gifted 
and accomplished animal neighbors. 

But with all this, the American table, taken as a whole, 
is inferior to that of England or France. It presents a fine 
abundance of material, carelessly and poorly treated. The 
management of food is nowhere in the world, perhaps, 
more slovenly and wasteful. Every thing betokens that want 
of care that waits on abundance ; there are great capabili- 
ties and poor execution. A tourist through England can 
seldom fail, at the quietest country-inn, of finding himself 
served with the essentials of English table-comfort — ^liis 
mutton-chop done to a turn, his steaming little private appa- 
ratus for concocting his own tea, his choice pot of marmalade 
or slice of cold ham, and his delicate rolls and creamy but- 
ter, all served with care and neatness. In France, one never 



GOOD COOKING. 169 

asks in vain for delicious cafi-au-lait, good bread and but- 
ter, a nice omelet, or some savory little portion of meat witb 
a French name. But to a tourist taking like chance in 
American country-fare, what is the prospect ? "What is the 
■coffee? what the tea? and the meat? and above all, the 
butter ? 

In writing on cooking, the mam topics should be first, 
bread ; second, butter ; third, meat ; fourth, vegetables ; 
and fifth, tea — by which last is meant, generically, all sorts 
of warm, comfortable drinks served out in tea-oups, whether 
"they be called tea, coffee, chocolate, broma, or what not. 

If these five departments are all perfect, the great ends 
-of domestic cookery are answered, so far as the comfort 
and well-being of life are concerned. There exists another 
department, which is often regarded by culinary amateurs 
■and young aspirants as the higher branch and very collegi- 
ate course of practical cookery ; to wit, confectionery, by 
which is designated all pleasing and complicated compounds 
of sweets and spices, devised not for health and nourish- 
ment, and strongly suspected of interfering with both — 
mere tolerated gratifications of the palate, which we eat, 
not with the expectation of being benefited, but only with 
the hope of not being injured by them. In this large de- 
partment rank all sorts of cakes, pies, preserves, etc., whose 
excellence is often attained by treading under foot and dis- 
regarding the five grand essentials. 

There is many a table garnished with three or four 
kinds of well-made cake, compounded with citron and 
Bpices and all imaginable good things, where the meat 
was tough and greasy, the bread some hot preparation 
■of fiour, lard, saleratus, and acid, and the butter un- 
utterably detestable, where, if the mistress of the feast 
had given the care, time, and labor to preparing the 
■eimple items of bread, butter, and meat, that she evi- 
dently had given to the preparation of these extras, the lot 
of her guests and family might be much more comfortable, 



lYQ THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

But she does not think of these common articles as consti 
tilting a good table. So long as she has pnff pastry, rich 
black cake, clear jelly and preserves, she considers that 
such unimportant matters as bread, butter, and meat may 
take care of themselves. It is the same iuattention to com- 
mon things as that which leads people to bmld houses with 
stone fronts, and window-caps and expensive front-door 
trimmings, without bathing-rooms or fireplaces, or venti- 
lators. 

Those who go into the country looking for summer board 
in farm-houses know perfectly well that a table where the 
butter is always fresh, the tea and coffee of the best kinds and 
well made, and the meats properly kept, dressed, and served, 
is the one table of a hundred, the fabulous enchanted island. 
It seems impossible to get the idea into the minds of many 
people that what is called common food, carefully prepared, 
becomes, in virtue of that very care and attention, a delicacy, 
superseding the necessity of artificially compounded dainties. 

To begiQ, then, with the very foundation of a good table 
— Bread : What ought it to be ? 

It should be light, sweet, and tender. This matter 
of lightness is the distinctive line between savage and 
civilized bread. The savage mixes simple flour and wa- 
ter into balls of paste, which he throws into boiling 
water, and which come out solid, glutinous masses, of which 
his common saying is, " Man eat dis, he no die," which a 
facetious traveler who was obliged to subsist on it inter- 
preted to mean, " Dis no kill you, nothing will." In short, 
it requires the stomach of a wild animal or of a savage to 
digest this primitive form of bread, and of course more or 
less attention in all civilized modes of bread-making is giv- 
en to producing lightness. By lightness iss meant simply 
that in order to facilitate digestion the pai^icles are to be 
separated from each other by little holes or air-cells ; and 
aU the different methods of making light bread are neither 
more nor less than the formation of bread with these ai^ 
cells. 



aOOD COOKING. 171 

So far as we know, there are four practicable methods of 
aerating bread ; namely, by fermentation ; by effervescence 
of an acid and an alkali ; by aerated egg, or egg which has 
been filled with air by the process of beating ; and lastly, 
by pressure of some gaseous substance into the paste, by a 
process much resembling the impregnation of water in a 
soda-fountain. All these have one and the same object — 
to give us the cooked particles of our flour separated by 
such permanent air-cells as will enable the stomach more 
readily to digest them. 

A very common mode of aerating bread in America ia 
by the effervescence of an acid and an alkali in the flour. 
The carbonic acid gas thus formed produces minute air- 
cells in the bread, or, as the cook says, makes it light. 
When this process is performed with exact attention to 
chemical laws, so that the acid and alkali completely neu- 
tralize each other, leaving no overplus of either, the result 
is often very palatable. The difficulty is, that this is a hap- 
py conjunction of circumstances which seldom occurs. The 
acid most commonly employed is that of sour milk, and, as 
milk has many degrees of sourness, the rule of a certain 
quantity of alkali to the pint must necessarily produce 
very different results at different times. As an actual fact 
where this mode of making bread prevails, as we lament to 
say it does to a great extent in this country, one finds five 
cases of failure to one of success. 

It is a woeful thing that the daughters of our land have 
abandoned the old respectable mode of yeast-brewing and 
bread-raising for this specious substitute, so easily made, 
and so seldom well made. The green, clammy, acrid sub- 
stance, called biscuit, which many of our worthy republi- 
cans are obliged to eat in these days, is wholly unworthy of 
the men and women of the republic. Good patriots ought 
not to be put off in that way — they deserve better fare. 

As an occasional variety, as a household convenience for 
obtaining bread or biscuit at a moment's notice, the process 



172 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

of effervescence may be retained ; but we earnestly entreat 
American housekeepers, in scriptural language, to stand in 
the way and ask for the old paths, and return to the good 
yeast-bread of their sainted grandmothers. 

If acid and alkali must be used, by all means let them 
be mixed in due proportions, ^o cook should be leit to 
guess and judge for herself about this matter. There are 
articles made by chemical rule which produce very perfect 
results, and the use of them obviates the worst dangers in 
making bread by effervescence. 

Of all processes of aeration in bread-making, the oldest 
and most time-honored mode is by fermentation. That 
this was known in the days of our Saviour is evident from 
the forcible simile in which he compares the silent penne- 
ating force of truth in human society to the very familiar 
household process of raising bread by a little yeast. 

There is, however, one species of yeast, much used in 
some parts of the country, against which protest should be 
made. It is called salt-risings, or milk-risings, and is made 
by mixing flour, milk, and a little salt together, and leaving 
them to ferment. The bread thus produced is often very 
attractive, when new and made with great care. It is white 
and delicate, with fine, even air-cells. It has, however, 
when kept, some characteristics which remind us of the 
terms in which our old English Bible describes the effect 
of keeping the manna of the ancient Israelites, which we 
are informed, in words more explicit than agreeable, " stank, 
and bred worms." If salt-rising bread does not fulfill the 
whole of this impleasant description, it certainly does em- 
phatically a part of it. The smell which it has in baking, 
and when more than a day old, suggests the inquiry, 
whether it is the saccharine or the putrid fermentation with 
which it is raised. Whoever breaks a piece of it after a 
day or two, will often see minute filaments or clammy strings 
drawing out from the fragments, which, with the unmis- 
takable smell, will cause him to pause before consummat- 
ing a nearer acquaintance. 



(itOUja COOKING. 173 

The fermentation of flour by means of brewer's or dis- 
tiller's yeast produces, if rightly managed, results far more 
palatable and wholesome. The only requisites for success 
in it are, first, good materials, and, second, great care in 
rimall things. There are certain low-priced or damaged 
kinds of flour which can never by any kind of domestic 
chemistry be made into good bread ; and to those persons 
whose stomachs forbid them to eat gummy, glutinous paste, 
under the name of bread, there is no economy in buying 
these poor brands, even at half the price of good flour. 

But good flour and good yeast being supposed, with a 
temperature favorable to the development of fermentation, 
the whole success of the process depends on the thorough 
diffusion of the proper proportion of yeast through the 
whole mass, and on stopping the subsequent fermentation 
at the precise and fortunate point. The true housewife 
makes her bread the sovereign of her kitchen — its behests 
must be attended to in all critical points and moments, no 
matter what else be postponed. 

She who attends to her bread only when she has done this, 
and arranged that, and performed the other, very often 
finds that the forces of nature will not wait for her. The 
snowy mass, perfectly mixed, kneaded with care and 
strength, rises in its beautiful perfection till the moment 
comes for filling the air- cells by baking. A few minutes now, 
and the acetous fermentation will begin, and the whole result 
be spoiled. Many bread-makers pass in utter carelessness 
over this sacred and mysterious boundary. Their oven has 
cake in it, or they are skimming jelly, or attending to Fome 
other of the so-called higher branches of cookery, whi'e the 
bread is quickly passing into the acetous stage. A t last, 
when they are ready to attend to it, they find that it has 
been going its own way, — it is so sour that the pungent 
smell is plainly perceptible. Now the saleratus-bottle is 
handed down, and a quantity of the dissolved alkali mixed 
with the paste — an expedient sometimes making itself too 



174 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

manifest by greenish streaks or small acrid spots ia the 
bread. As the result, we have a beautiful article spoiled 
— bread without sweetness, if not absolutely sour. 

In the view of many, lightness is the only property re- 
quired in this article. The delicate refined sweetness which 
exists in carefully kneaded bread, baked just before it 
passes to the extreme point of fermentation, is something 
of wliich they have no conception ; and thus they will even 
regard this process of spoiling the paste by the acetous fer- 
mentation, and then rectifying that acid by effervescence 
with an alkali, as something positively meritorious. How 
else can they value and relish bakers' loaves, such as some 
are, drugged with ammonia and other disagreeable things ; 
light indeed, so light that they seem to have neither weight 
nor substance, but with no more sweetness or taste than so 
much cotton wool ? 

Some persons prepare bread for the oven by simply mix- 
iug it in the mass, without kneading, pouring it into pans, 
and suffering it to rise there. The air-cells in bread thus 
prepared are coarse and imeven ; the bread is as inferior in 
delicacy and nicety to that which is well kneaded as a raw 
servant to a perfectly educated and refined lady. The pro- 
cess of kneading seems to impart an evenness to the miaute 
air-cells, a fineness of textijre, and a tenderness and plia- 
bility to the whole substance, that can be gained in no other 
way. 

The divine principle of beauty has its reign over bread 
as well as over all other things ; it has its laws of aesthetics ; 
anil that bread which is so prepared that it can be formed 
intc separate and well-proportioned loaves, each one care- 
fully worked and moulded, will develop the most beautiful 
results. After being moulded, the loaves should stand usually 
not over ten minutes, just long enough to allow the fermenta- 
tion going on in them to expand each little air-cell to the 
point at which it stood before it was worked down, and then 
they should be immediately put into the oven. 



GOOD GOOKINQ. 176 

Many a good thing, however, is spoiled in the oven. We 
can not but regret, for the sake of bread, that our old 
steady brick ovens have been almost universally superseded 
by those of ranges and cooking-stoves, which are infinite in 
their caprices, and forbid all general rules. One thing, 
however, may be borne in mind as a principle — that the 
excellence of bread in all its varieties, plain or sweetened, 
depends on the perfection of its air-cells, whether produced 
by yeast, egg, or efiervescence ; that one of ^ the objects of 
baking is to fix these air-cells, and that the quicker this can 
be done through the whole mass, the better will the residt 
be. When cake or bread is made heavy by baking too 
quickly, it is because the immediate formation of the top 
crust hinders the exhaling of the moisture in the centre, 
and prevents the air-cells from cooking. The weight also 
of the crust pressing down on the doughy air-cells below de- 
stroys them, producing that horror of good cooks, a heavy 
streak. The problem in baking, then, is the quick applica- 
tion of heat rather below than above the loaf, and its steady 
continuance till all the air-cells are thoroughly dried into 
permanent consistency. Every housewife must watch her 
own oven to know how this can be best accomplished. 

Bread-making can be cultivated to any extent as a fine 
art — and the various Mnds of biscuit, tea-rusks, twists, 
rolls, into which bread may be made, are much better worth 
a housekeeper's ambition than the getting-up of rich and 
expensive cake or confections. There are also varieties of 
material which are rich in good effects. Unbolted flour, 
altogether more wholesome than the fine wheat, and when 
properly prepared more palatable — rye-flour and corn-meal, 
each affbrding a thousand attractive possibilities — all of 
these come under the general laws of bread-stuffs, and are 
worth a careful attention. 

A peculiarity of our American table, particularly in the 
Southern and Western States, is the constant exhibition of 
various preparations of hot bread. In many families of the 



176 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

South and "West, bread in loaves to be eaten cold is an ar- 
ticle quite unknown. The effect of this kind of diet upon 
the health has formed a frequent subject of remark among 
travelers ; hut only those know the full mischiefs of it who 
have been compelled to sojourn for a length of time in 
families where it is maintained. The unknown horrors of 
dyspepsia from bad bread are •% topic over which we will- 
ingly draw a vail. 

Next to Bread comes Butter — on which we have to say, 
that, when we remember what butter is in civilized Europe, 
and compare it with what it is in America, we wonder at 
the forbearance and lenity of travelers in their strictures on 
our national commissariat. 

Butter, in England, France, and Italy, is simply solidified 
cream, with all the sweetness of the cream in its taste, fresh- 
ly churned each day, and unadulterated by salt. At the 
present moment, when salt is five cents a pound and butter 
fifty, we Americans are paying, at high prices, for about one 
pound of salt to every ten of butter, and those of us who 
have eaten the butter of France and England do this with 
rueful recollections. 

There is, it is true, an article of butter made in the 
American style with salt, which, in its own kind and way, 
has a merit not inferior to that of England and France. 
Many prefer it, and it certainly takes a rank equally respect- 
able with the other. It is yellow, hard, and worked so 
perfectly free from every particle of buttermilk that it 
might make the voyage of the world without spoiling. It 
is salted, but salted with care and delicacy, so that it may 
be a question whether even a fastidious Englishman might 
not prefer its golden solidity to the white, creamy freshness 
of his own. But it is to be regretted that this article is the 
exception, and not the rule, on our tables. 

America must have the credit of manufacturing and put-

tastes and smells which prevail in it are quite a study. 
This has a cheesy taste, that a mouldy, this is flavored with 
cabbage, and that again with turnip, and another has the 
strong, sharp savor of rancid animal fat. These varieties 
probably come from the practice' of churning only at long 
intervals, and keeping the cream meanwhile in unventilated 
cellars or dairies, the air of which is loaded with the efllu- 
via of vegetable substances. No domestic articles are so 
sympathetic as those of the milk tribe : they readily take 
on the smell and taste of any neighboring substance, and 
hence the infinite Variety of flavors on which one mournful- 
ly muses who has late in autumn to taste twenty firkins of 
butter in hopes of finding ©ne which wiU simply not be in- 
tolerable on his winter table. ^ 

A matter for despair as regards bad butter is, that at the 
tables where it is used it stands sentinel at the door to bar 
your way to every other kind of food. You turn from your 
dreadful half-slice of bread, which fills your mouth with 
bitterness, to your beef-steak, which proves virulent with 
the same poison ; you think to take refuge in vegetable diet, 
and find the butter in the string-beans, and polluting the in- 
nocence of early peas ; it is in the com, in the succotash, in 
the squash ; the beets swim in it, the onions have it poured 
over them. Hungry and miserable, you think to solace 
yom'self at the dessert ; but the pastry is cursed, the cake is 
acrid with the same plague. You are ready to howl with 
despair, and your misery is great upon you — especially if 
this is a table where you have taken board for three months 
with your delicate wife and four small children. Your case 
is dreadful, and it is hopeless, because long usage and habit 
have rendered your host perfectly incapable of discovering 
what is the matter. " Don't like the butter, sir ? I assure 
you I paid an extra price for it, and it's the very best in the 
market. I looked over as many as a hundred tubs, and 
picked out this one." You are dumb, but not less despair- 
ing. 



178 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Yet tlie process of matiag good butter is a very simple 
one. To keep the cream ia a perfectly pure, cool atmo- 
sphere, to churn while it is yet sweet, to work out the but- 
termilk thoroughly, and to add salt with such discretion as 
not to rnin the fine, delicate flavor of the fresh creaih — aU 
this is quite simple, so simple that one wonders at thousands 
and millions of pounds of butter yearly manufactured 
which are merely a hobgoblia bewitchment of cream into 
foul and loathsome poisons. 

The third head of my discourse is that of Meat, of which 
America furnishes, in the gross material, enough to spread 
our tables royaUy, were it well cared for and served. 

The faults in the meat generally furnished to us are, first, 
that it is too new. A beef steak, which three or four days 
of keeping might render palatable, is served up to us palpi- 
tating with freshness, with all the toughness of animal mus- 
cle yet warm. 

In the next place, there is a woeful lack of nicety in the 
butcher's work of cutting and preparing meat. "Who that 
remembers the neatly trimmed mutton-chop of an English 
ion, or the artistic little circle of lamb-chop fried in bread- 
crumbs coiled around a tempting centre of spinach which 
may always be found in France, can recognize any family 
resemblance to those dapper, civilized preparations, in these 
coarse, roughly-hacked strips of bone, gristle, and meat 
which are commonly called mutton-chop in America? 
There' seems to be a large dish of something resembling 
meat, in which each fragment has about two or three edible 
morsels, the rest being composed of dry and burnt skin, fat, 
and ragged bone. 

Is it not time that civilization should learn to demand 
somewhat more care and nicety in the modes of preparing 
what is to be cooked and eaten ? Might not some of the re- 
finement and trimness which characterize the preparations 
of the European market be with advantage introduced into 
our own ? The housekeeper who wishes to garnish her ta

ble with some of those nice things is stopped in the outset' 
by the butcher. Except in our large cities, where some for- 
eign travel may have created the demand, it seems impossi- 
ble to get much in this hne that is properly prepared. 

If this is urged on the score of aesthetics, the ready reply 
will be, " Oh ! we can't give time here in America to go into 
niceties and French whim-whams !" But the French mode 
of doing almost all practical things is based on that true 
philosophy and utilitarian good sense which characterize 
that seemingly thoughtless people. Nowhere is economy a 
more careful study, and their market is artistically arranged 
to this end. The rule is so to cut their meats that no por- 
tion designed to be cooked in a certain manner shall have 
wasteful appendages which that mode of cooking will spoil. 
The French soup-kettle stands ever ready to receive the 
bones, the thin fibrous flaps, the sinewy and gristly portions, 
which are so often included in our roasts or broilings, which 
fill our plates with unsightly debris, and finally make an 
amount of blank waste for which we pay our butcher the 
same price that we pay for what we have eaten. 

The dead waste of our clumsy, coarse way of cutting 
meats is immense. For example, at the beginning of the 
season, the part of a lamb denominated leg and loin, or 
hind-quarter, may sell for thirty cents a pound. Now this 
includes, besides the thick, fleshy portions, a quantity of 
bone, sinew, and thin fibrous substance, constituting full 
one third of the whole weight. If we put it into the oven 
entire, in the usual manner, we have the thin parts over- 
done, and the skinny and fibrous parts utterly dried up, by 
the application of the amount of heat necessary to cook 
the thick portion. Supposing the joint to weigh six pounds, 
at thirty cents, and that one third of the weight is so treat- 
ed as to become perfectly useless, we throw away sixty 
cents. Of a piece of beef at twenty-five cents a pound, 
fifty cents' worth is often lost in bone, fat, and burnt s'dn. 

The fact is, this way of selling and cooking meat in 



;[80 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

'arge, gross portions is of English origin, and belongs to a 
country where all the customs of society spring from a class 
who have no particular occasion for economy. The prac- 
tice of minute and delicate dirision comes from a nation 
which acknowledges the need of economy, and has made it 
a study. A quarter of lamb in this mode of division would 
be sold in three nicely prepared portions. The thick part 
would be sold by itself, fox a neat, compact little roast ; 
the. rib-bones would be artistically separated, and all the 
edible matter would form those delicate dishes of lamb- 
chop, which, fried in bread-crumbs to a golden brown, 
are so ornamental and palatable a side-dish ; the triiiunings 
which remain after this division would be destined to the 
soup-kettle or stew-pan. 

In a French market is a little portion for every purse, 
and the far-famed and delicately flavored soups and stews 
which have arisen out of French economy are a study worth 
a housekeeper's attention. Not one atom of food is wasted 
in the French modes of preparation ; even tough animal 
cartilages and sinews, instead of appearing burned and 
.blackened in company with the roast meat to which they 
happen to be related, are treated according to their own 
laws, and come out either in savory soups, or those fine, 
clear meat-jelhes which form a garnish no less agreeable to 
the eye than palatable to the taste. 

Whether this careful, economical, practical style of meat- 
cooking can ever to any great extent be introduced into our 
Idtchens now is a question. Our butchers are against it ; 
our servants are wedded to the old wholesale wasteful ways, 
which seem to them easier because they are accustomed to 
thenj. A cook who will keep and properly tend a soup- 
kettle which shall receive and utilize all that the coarse 
preparations of the butcher would require her to trim away, 
who understands the art of making the most of all these 
remaiuc'. is a treasure scarcely to be hoped for. If sucli 
things ai3 to be done, it must be primarily through the 



GOOD COOKINQ. 181 

educated brain of cultivated women who do not scorn to 
turn their culture and refinement upon domestic problems. 

"When meats have been properly divided, so that each 
portion can receive its own appropriate style of treatment, 
next comes the consideration of the modes of cooking. 
These may be divided into two great general classes : those 
where it is desired to keep the juices within the meat, as in 
. baking, broiling, and frying — and those whose object is to 
extract the juice and dissolve the fibre, as in the making 
of soups and stews. In the fii-st class of operations, the 
process must be as rapid as may consist with the thorough 
cooking of all the particles. In this branch of cookery, 
doing quickly is doing well. The fire must be brisk, the 
attention alert. The introduction of cooking-stoves offers 
to careless domestics facilities for gradually drying-up 
meats, and despoiling them of all flavor and nutriment — 
facilities which appear to be very generally accepted. 
They have almost banished the genuine, old-fashioned 
roast-meat from our tables, and left in its stead dried meats 
with their most precious and nutritive juices evaporated. 
How few cooks, unassisted, are competent to the simple 
process of broiling a beefsteak or mutton-chop ! how very 
generally one has to choose between these meats gradually 
dried away, or burned on the outside and raw within ! 
Yet in England these articles never come on the table done 
amiss ; their perfect cooking is as absolute a certainty as the 
rising of the sun. 

No one of these rapid processes of cooking, however, is 
so generally abused as frying. The frying-pan has awful 
sins to answer for. What untold horrors of dyspepsia have 
arisen from its smoky depths, like the ghost from witches' 
caldrons ! The fizzle of frying meat is a warning knell on 
many an ear, saying, " Touch not, taste not, if you would 
not bum and writhe !" 

Yet those who have traveled abroad remember that 
some of the lightest, most palatable, and most digestible 



182 THE EOUSEKEEPEB'S MANUAL. 

preparations of meat have come from this dangerous 
som-ce. But we fancy quite other rites and ceremonies 
inaugurated the process, and quite other hands performed 
its offices, than those known to our kitchens. Probably the 
delicate cttelettes of France are not flopped down into half- 
melted grease, there gradually to warm and soak and fizzle, 
while Biddy goes in and out on her other ministrations, till 
finally, when they are thoroughly saturated, and dinner -hour 
impends, she bethinks herself, and crowds the fire below to 
a roaring heat, and finishes the process by a smart bum, ia- 
volving the kitchen and surrounding precincts in volumes 
of Stygian gloom. From such preparations has arisen the 
very current medical opinion that fried meats are indigesti- 
ble. They are indigestible, if they are greasy ; but French 
cooks have taught us that a thing has no more need to 
be greasy because emerging from grease than Yenus had 
to be salt because she rose from the sea. 

There are two ways of frying employed by the French 
cook. One is, to immerse the article to be cooked ia hoil- 
■mg fat, with an emphasis on the present participle — and 
the phUosophical principle is, so immediately to crisp every 
pore, at the first moment or two of immersion, as eflfectually 
to seal the iaterior against the intrusion of greasy particles ; 
it can then remain as long as may be necessary thoroughly 
to cook it, without imbibing any more of the boiHng fluid 
than if it were inclosed in an egg-shell. The other method 
is to rub a perfectly smooth iron surface with just enough 
of some oily substance to prevent the meat from adhering, 
and cook it with a quick heat, as cakes are .baked on a 
griddle. In both these cases there must be the most rapid 
application of heat that can be made without burning, and 
by the adroitness shown in working out this problem tlie 
skill of the cook is tested. Any one whose cook attains 
this important secret will flnd fried things quite as digestible, 
and often more palatable, than any other. 

In the second department of meat-cookery, to wit, the 



900D COOKING. 183 

slow and gradual application of heat for the softening and 
dissolution of its fibre and the extraction of its juices, 
common cooks are equally untrained. Where is 'the so- 
called cook who understands how to prepare soups and 
stews? These are precisely the articles in which a 
French kitchen excels. The soup-kettle, made with a 
double bottom, to prevent burning, is a permanent, ever- 
present institution, and the coarsest and most impracticable 
meats distilled .through that alembic come out again in 
soups, jellies, or savory stews. The toughest cartilage, even 
the bones, being first cracked, are here made to give forth 
their hidden virtues, and to rise ia delicate and appetizing 
forms. 

One great law governs all these preparations : the appli- 
cation of heat must be gradual, steady, long protracted, 
never reaching the point of active boiling. Hours of quiet 
simmering dissolve all dissoluble parts, soften the sternest 
fibre, and unlock every minute cell in which Nature has 
stored away her treasures of nourishment. This carefid 
and protracted application of heat and the skillful use of 
flavors constitute the two main points in all those nice 
preparations of meat for which the French have so many 
names — processes by which a delicacy can be imparted to 
the coarsest and cheapest food superior to that of the finest 
articles under Ifess philosophic treatment. 

French soups and stews are a study, and they would 
not be an unprofitable one to any person who wishes to 
live'with comfort and even elegance on small means. 

There is no animal fibre that mil not yield itself up to long- 
continued, steady heat. But the difficulty with almost any 
of the common servants who call themselves cooks is, that 
they have not the smallest notion of the philosophy of the 
application of heat. Such a one will complacently tell you 
concerning certain meats, that the harder you boil them the 
harder they grow — an obvious fact which, under her mode 
of treatment by an indiscriminate galloping boil, has fre^ 



184 THE EOnSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

quently come under her personal observation. If you +el] 
her that such meat must stand for six hours in a heat just 
below the boiling point, she will probably answer, " Yes, 
ma'am," and go on her own way. Or she will let it stand 
tUl it bums to the bottom of the kettle — a most common 
termination of the experiment. 

The only way to make sure of the matter is, either to ob- 
taiu a J? rench kettle, or to fit iato an ordinary kettle a false 
bottom, ?uch as any tinman may make, that shall leave a 
space of an inch or two between the meat and the fire. 
This kettle may be maintained in a constant position on 
the range, and into it the cook may be instructed to throw 
all the fibrous trimmings of meat, all the gristle, tendons, 
and bones, having previously broken up these last with a 
mallet. Such a kettle, the regular occupant of a French 
cooking-stove, which they call the pot au feu, will furnish 
the basis for clear, rich soups, or other palatable dishes. This 
is ordinarily called " stock." 

Clear soup consists of the dissolved juices of the meat 
and gelatine of the bones, cleared fron' the fat and fibrous 
portions by straining. The grease, which rises to the top of 
the fluid, may be easily removed when cold. 

English and American soups are often heavy and hot 
with spices. There are appreciable tastes in them. They 
bui'u your mouth with cayenne, or clove, or allspice. You 
can tell at once what is in them, oftentimes to your sorrow. 
But a French soup has a flavor which one recognizes at 
once as delicious, yet not to be characterized as due to' any 
single condiment ; it is the just blending of many things. 
The same remark applies to all their stews, ragouts, and 
other delicate preparations. No cook will ever study these 
flavors ; but perhaps many co.oks^ mistresses may, and thus 
be able to impart' delicacy and comfort to economy. 

As to those things called hashes, commonly manufac- 
tured by unwatched, untaught cooks out of the remains of 
yesterday's meal, let us not dwell too closely on their mem- 



GOOD COOKING. 185 

ory — compounds of meat, gristle, skin, fat, and burnt fibre, 
with a handful of pepper and salt flung at them, dredged 
with lumpy flour, watered from the spout of the tea-kettle, 
and left to simmer at the cook's convenience while she is 
othei*wise occupied. Such are the best performances a 
housekeeper can hope for from an untrained cook. 

But the cunningly devised minces, the artful preparations 
choicely flavored, which may be made of yesterday's repast 
— by these is the true domestic artist known. No cook un- 
taught by an educated brain ever makes these, and yet 
economy is a great gainer by them. 

As regards the department of Vegetables, their number 
and variety in America are so great that a table might al- 
most be furnished by these alone. Generally speaking, 
their cooking is a more simple art, and therefore more like- 
ly to be found satisfactorily performed, than that of meats. 
If only they are not drenched vsdth rancid butter, their own 
native excellence makes itself known in most of the ordi- 
nary modes of preparation. 

There is, however, one exception. Our staunch old 
friend, the potato, is to other vegetables what bread is on 
the table. Like bread, it is held as a sort of sine-qua-non ; 
like that, it may be made invariably palatable by a little 
care in a few plain particulars, through neglect of which 
it often becomes intolerable. The soggy, waxy, indigesti- 
ble viand that often appears in the potato-dish is a down- 
right sacrifice of the better nature of this vegetable. 

The potato, nutritive and harmless as it appears, belongs 
to a family suspected of very dangerous traits. It is a 
family connection of the deadly-nightshade and other ill-re- 
puted gentry, and sometimes shows strange proclivities to 
e^dl — now breaking out uproariously, as in. the noted pota- 
to-rot, and now more covertly, in various evil affections. 
For this reason scientific directors bid us beware of the war 
ter in which potatoes are boiled — into which, it appears, the 
evil principle is drawn off; and they caution us not to shred , 



186 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

them into stews without previously suffering the slices to lie 
for an hour or so in salt and water. These cautions are 
worth attention. 

The fnost usual modes of preparing the potato for the ta- 
ble are by roasting or boiling. These processes are so^sim- 
ple that it is commonly supposed every cook understands 
them without special directions ; and yet there, is scarcely 
an uninstructed cook who can boil or roast a potato. 

A good roasted potato is a delicacy worth a dozen com 
positions of the cook-book ; yet when we ask for it, what 
burnt, shriveled abortions are presented to us ! Biddy 
rushes to her potato-basket and pours out two dozen of dif- 
ferent sizes, some having in them three times the amount of 
matter of others. These being washed, she tumbles them 
into her oven at a leisure interval, and there lets them lie till 
it is time to serve breakfast, whenever that may be. As a 
result, if the largest are cooked, the smallest are presented 
in cinders, and the intermediate sizes are withered and wa- 
tery. Nothing is so utterly ruined by a few moments of 
overdoing. That which at the right moment was plump 
with mealy richness, a quarter of an hour later shrivels 
and becomes watery — and it is in this state that roast pota- 
toes are most frequently served. 

In the same manner we have seen boiled potatoes from 
an untaught cook coming upon the table like lumps of yel- 
low wax — and the same article, under the directions of a 
skillful mistress, appearing in snowy balls of powdery w-hite- 
ness. In the one case, they were thrown in their skins into 
water, and suffered to soak or boil, as the case might be, at 
the cook's leisure, and after they were boiled to stand in 
the water till she was ready to peel them. In the other 
case, the potatoes being first peeled were boiled as quickly 
as possible in salted water, which the moment they were 
done was drained off, and then they were gently shaken 
for a moment or two over the fire to dry them still more 
thoroughly. "We have never yet seen the potato so de-

praved and given over to evil that it could not be reclaimed 
by this mode of treatment. 

As to fried potatoes, who that remembers the crisp, gold- 
en slices of the French restaurant, thin as wafers and light 
as snow-flakes, does not speak respectfully of them ? "What 
cousinship with these have those coarse, greasy masses of 
sliced potato, wholly soggy and partly burnt, to which we 
are treated under the name of fried potatoes in America ? 
In our cities the restaurants are introducing the French 
article to great acceptance, and to the vindication of the 
fair fame of this queen of vegetables. 

Finally, we arrive at the last great head of our subject, 
to wit — Tea — meaning thereby, as before observed, what 
our Hibernian friend did in the inquiry, " "Will y'r honor 
take ' tay tay ' or coffee tay ?" 

"We are not about to enter into the merits of the great 
tea-and-coffee controversy, further than in our general cau- 
tion concerning them in the chapter on Healthful Drinks ; 
but we now proceed to treat of them as actual existences, 
and speak only of the modes of making the best of them. 

The French coffee is reputed the best in the world ; and 
a thousand voices have asked, "What is it about the French 
coffee ? 

In the first place, then, the French coffee is coffee, and 
not chickory, or rye, or beans, or peas. In the second 
place, it is freshly roasted, whenever made — ^roasted with 
great care and evenness in a little revolving cylinder which 
makes part of the furniture of every kitchen, and which 
keeps in the aroma of the berry. It is never overdone, so 
as to destroy the coffee-flavor, which is in nine cases out of 
ten the fault of the coffee we meet with. Then it is ground, 
and placed in a coffee-pot with a filter through which, when 
it has yielded up its life to the boiling water poured upon 
it, the delicious extract percolates in clear drops, the coffee- 
pot standing on a heated stove to maintain the temperature. 
The nose of the coffee-pot is stopped up to prevent the efr 



][88 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

cape of the aroma during this process. The extract thua 
obtained is a perfectly clear, dark fluid, known as cafinoir, 
or black coffee. It is black only because of its strength, 
being in fact almost the very essential oil of coffee. A ta- 
ble-spoonful of this in boiled milk would make what is or- 
dinarily called a strong cup of coffee. , The boiled milk is 
prepared with no less care. It must be fresh and new, not 
merely warmed or even brought to the boiling-point, but 
slowly simmered till it attains a thick, creamy richness. The 
coffee mixed with this, and sweetened with that sparkling 
beet-root sugar which ornaments a French table, is the cele- 
brated cafi-au-lait, the name of which has gone round the 
world. 

As we look to France for the best coffee, so we must look 
to England for the perfection of tea. The tea-kettle is as 
much an English institution as aristocracy or the Prayer- 
Book ; and when one wants to know exactly how tea should 
be made, one has only to ask how a fine old English house- 
keeper makes it. 

The first article of her faith is, that the water must not 
merely be hot, not merely have hoihd a few moments since, 
but be actually loilmg at the moment it touches the tea. 
Hence, though servants in England are vastly better trained 
than with us, this delicate mystery is seldom left to their 
hands. Tea-making belongs to the drawing-room, and high- 
born ladies preside at " the bubbling and loud hissing urn," 
and see that all due. rites and solemnities are properly pe> 
formed — that the cups are hot, and that the infused tea 
waits the exact time before the libations commence. 

Of .late, the introduction of English breakfast-tea has 
raised a new sect among the tea-drinkers, reversing some of 
the old canons. Breakfast- tea must be boiled ! Unlike 
the delicate article of olden time, which required only a 
momentary infusion to develop its richness, this requires a 
longer and severer treatment to bring out its strength — 
thus confasing all the established usages, and throwing the 



GOOD COOKING. 189 

work into tLe hands of the cook in the kitchen. The 
faults of tea, as too commonly found at our hotels and 
boarding-houses, are, that it is made in every way the 
reverse of what it should be. The water is hot, perhaps, 
but not boiling; the tea lias a general flat, stale, smoky 
taste, devoid of life or spirit ; and it is served usually with 
thin mUk, instead of cream. Cream is as essential to the 
richness of tea as of coffee. Lacking cream, boiled milk is 
better than cold. 

Chocolate is a French and Spanish article, and one sel- 
dom served on American tables. We in America, however, 
make an article every way equal to any which can be im- 
ported from Paris, and he who buys the best vanilla-choco- 
late may rest assured that no foreign land can furnish any 
thing better. A very rich and delicious beverage may be 
made by dissolving this ia milk, slowly boiled down after 
the French fashion. 

A word now under the head of Confectionery, meaning 
by this the whole range of ornamental cookery — or pastry, 
ices, jellies, preserves, etc. The art of making all these 
very perfectly is far better understood in America than the 
art of common cooking. There are more women who 
know how to make good cake than good bread — ^more who 
can fbmish you with a good ice-cream than a weU-cooked 
m.'utton-chop ; a fair charlotte-russe is easier to gain than 
a perfect cup of coffee ; and you shall find a sparkling 
jelly to your dessert where you sighed in vain for so sim- 
ple a luxury as a well-cooked potato. 

Our fair countrywomen might rest upon their laurels in 
these higher fields, and turn their great energy and ingenu- 
ity to the study of essentials. To do common things per- 
fectly is far better worth our endeavor than to do uncom- 
mon things respectably. We Americans ia many things as 
yet have been a little inclined to begin making our shirt at 
the ruffle ; but, nevertheless, when we set about it, we can 
make the shirt as nicely as any body ; it needs only that we

turn our attention to it, resolved that, ruffle or no raffle, 
the shirt we will h-ave. 

A few words as to the prevalent ideas in respect to 
French cookery. Having heard much of it, with no very 
distinct idea of what it is, our people have somehow fallen 
into the notion that its forte lies in high spicing — and so 
when our cooks put a great abundance of clove, mace, nut- 
meg, and cinnamon into their preparations, they fancy 
that they are growing,, up to be French cooks. But the 
fact is, that the Americans and English are far more given 
to spicing than the French. Spices in our made dishes 
are abundant, and their taste is strongly pronounced. Liv- 
ing a year in France one forgets the taste of nutmeg, clove, 
and allspice, which abounds in so many dishes in Ameri- 
ca. The English and Americans deal in spices, the French 
in fla/oors — flavors many and fine, imitating often in 
their delicacy those subtle blendings which nature pro- 
duces in high-flavored fruits. The recipes of our cookery- 
books are most of them of English origin, coming down 
from the times of our phlegmatic ancestors, when the solid, 
burly, beefy growth of the foggy island required the heat 
of fiery condiments, and could digest heavy sweets. Wit- 
ness the national recipe for plum-pudding : which may be 
rendered : Take a pound of every indigestible substance 
you can think of, boil into a cannon-ball, 4nd serve in 
flaming brandy. So of the Christmas mince-pie, and 
many other national dishes. But in America, owing to 
our brighter skies and more fervid climate, we have devel- 
oped an acute, nervous delicacy of temperament far more 
akin to that of France than of England. 

Half of the recipes in our cook-books are mere murder 
to such constitutions and stomachs as we grow here. We 
require to ponder these things, and think how we, in our, 
climate and under our circumstances, ought to live ; and in 
doing so, we may, without accusation of foreign foppery, 
take some leaves from many foreign books.

Theee is no practice which has been more extensively 
eulogized in all ages than early rising ; and this universal 
impression is an indication that it is f oimded on true philo- 
sophy. For it is rarely the case that the common sense of 
mankind fastens on a practice as really beneficial, especially 
one that demands self-denial, without some 'substantial 
reason. 

This practice, which may justly be called a domestic vir- 
tue, is one which has a peculiar claim to be styled American 
and democratic. The distiactive mark of aristocratic nations 
is a disregard of the great mass, and a disproportionate re- 
gard for the interests of certain privileged orders. AU the 
customs and habits of such a nation are, to a greater or less 
extent, regulated by this principle. Now the mass of any 
nation must always consist of persons who labor at occupa- 
tions which demand the light of day. But in aristocratic 
countries, especially in England, labor is regarded as the 
mark of the lower classes, and indolence is considered as 
one mark of a gentleman. This impression has gradually 
and imperceptibly, to a great extent, regulated their cus- 
toms, so that, even in their hours of meals and repose, the 
higher orders aim at being different and distinct from those 
who, by laborious pursuits, are placed below them. From 
this circumstance, while the lower orders labor by day and 
sleep at night, the rich, the noble, and the honored sleep by 
day, and follow their pursuits and pleasures by night. 

It will be found that the aristocracy of London breakfast

near midday, dine after dark, visit and go to Parliament be 
tween ten and twelve at night, and retii'e to Bleep toward 
morning. In consequence of tHs, tlie subordinate classes 
who aim at gentility gradually fall into the same practice. 
Tlie influence oi this custom extends across the ocean, and 
here, in this democratic land, we find many who measure 
tlieir grade of gentility by the late hour at which they arrive 
at a party. And this aristocratic folly is growing upon us, 
60 that, throughout the nation, the hours for visiting and 
retiring are constantly becoming later, while the hours for 
rising correspond in lateness. 

The question, then, is one which appeals to American 
women, as a matter of patriotism and as having a bearing on 
those great principles of democracy which we conceive to 
be equally the principles of Christianity. Shall we form 
our customs on the assumption that labor is degrading and 
indolence genteel ? Shall we assume, by our practice, that 
the interests of the great mass are to be sacrificed for the 
pleasures and honors of a privileged few ? Shall we ape the 
customs of aristocratic lands, in those very practices which 
result from principles and institutions that we condemn? 
Shall we not rather take the place to which we are entitled, 
as the leaders, rather than the followers, in the customs of 
society, turnback the tide of aristocratic inroads, and carry 
through the whole, not only of civil and political but of 
social and domestic life, the true principles of democratic 
freedom and equality ? The following considerations may 
serve to strengthen an affirmative decision. 

The first relates to the health of a family. It is a uni- 
versal law of physiology, that all living things flourish best 
in the light. Yegetables, in a dark cellar, grow pale and 
spindling. Children brought up in mines are always wan 
and stunted, while men become pale and cadaverous who 
live under ground. This indicates the folly of losing the 
genial influence which the light of day produces on all 
animated creation.

Sir James "Wylie, of the Eussian imperial service, states 
that in the soldiers' barracks, three times as many were 
taken sick on the shaded side as on the sunny side ; though 
both sides commimicated, and discipline, diet, and treatment 
were the same. The eminent French surgeon, Dupuytren, 
ciu-ed a lady whose complicated diseases baffled for years 
his own and all other medical skill, by taking her from a 
dark room to an abundance of daylight. 

Florence Nightingale writes : " Seoond only to fresh air 
in importance for the sick is light. Not only daylight but 
direct sunlight is necessary to speedy recovery, except in a 
small number of cases. Instances, almost endless, could be 
given where, in dark wards, or wards with only northern 
exposure, or wards with borrowed light, even when proper- 
ly ventilated, the sick could not be, by any means, made 
speedily to recover." 

In the prevalence of cholera, it was invariably the case 
that deaths were more numerous in shaded streets or in 
houses having only northern exposures than in those having 
sunlight. Several physicians have stated to the writer that, 
in sunny exposures, women after childbirth gained strength 
much faster than those excluded from sunlight. In the 
writer's experience, great nervous debility has been always 
immediately lessened by sitting in the sun, and still more by 
lying on the earth and in open air, a blanket beneath, and 
head and eyes protected, under the direct rays of the sun. 

Some facts in physiology and natural philosophy have a 
bearing on this subject. It seems to be settled that the red 
color of blood is owing to iron contained in the red blood- 
cells, while it is established as a fact that the sun's rays are 
metallic, having " vapor of iron " as one element. It is also 
true that want of light causes a diminution of the red and 
an increase of the imperfect white blood-cells, and that this 
sometimes results in a disease called leucoemia, while all 
who live in the dark have pale and waxy skins, and flabby, 
weak musclesi Thus it would seem that it is the sun that 



J94 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

imparts the iron and color to the blood. These things be- 
ing so, the customs of society that bring sleeping hours into 
daylight, and working and study hours into the night, are 
direct violations of the laws of health. The laws of health 
are the laws of God, and " sin is the transgression of law." 

To this we must add the great neglect of economy as 
well as health in substituting unhealthful gaslight, poison- 
ous, anthracite warmth, for the life-giving light and warmth 
of the sun. Millions and millions would be saved to this 
nation in fuel and light, as well as in health, by returning 
to the good old ways of our forefathers, to rise with the 
sun, and retire to rest "when the bell rings for nine 
o'clock." 

The observations of medical men, whose inquiries have 
been directed to this point, have decided that from six to 
eight hours is the amount of sleep demanded by persons in 
health. Some constitutions require as much as eight, and 
others no more than six hours of repose. But eight hours 
is the maximum for all persons in ordinary health, with or- 
dinary occupations. In cases of extra physical exertions, 
or the debility of disease, or a decayed constitution, more 
than this is required. Let eight hours, then, be regarded 
as the ordinary period required for' sleep by an indus- 
trious people like the Americans. 

It thus appears that the laws of our political condition, 
the laws of the natural world, and the constitution of our 
bodies, alike demand that we rise with the light of day to 
prosecute our employments, and that we retire in time for 
the requisite amount of sleep. 

In regard to the effects of protracting the time spent in 
repose, many extensive and satisfactory investigations have 
been made. It has been shown that, during sleep, the body 
perspires most freely, while yet neither food nor exercise 
are ministering to its wants. Of course, if we continue our 
slumbers beyond the time required to restore the body to 
its usual vigor, there is an unperceived imdermining of the 



EARLT RISINB. 195 

constitution, by this protracted and debilitating exhalation. 
This process, in a course of years, renders tbe body deli- 
cate and less able to withstand disease, and in the result 
shortens life. Sir John Sinclair, who has written a large 
work on the Causes of Longevity, states, as one result of 
his extensive investigations, that he has never yet heard 
or read of a single case of great longevity where the indi- 
vidual was not an early riser. He says that he has found 
cases in which the individual has violated some one of all 
the other laws of health, and yet lived to great age ; but 
never a single instance in which any constitution has with- 
stood that undermining consequent on protracting the 
hours of repose beyond the demands of the system. 

Another reason for early rising is, that it is indispensa- 
ble to a systematic and well-regulated family. At what- 
ever hour the parents retire, children and domestics, weari- 
ed by play or labor, must retire early. Children usually 
awake with the dawn of light, and commence their play, 
while domestics usually prefer the freshness of morning for 
their labors. If, then, the parents rise at a late hour, they 
either induce a habit of protracting sleep in their children 
and domestics, or else the family are up, and at their pur- 
suits, while their supervisors are in bed. 

Any woman who asserts that her children and domestics, in 
the first hours of day, when their spirits are freshest, will 
be as well regulated without her presence as with it, con- 
fesses that which surely is little for her credit. It is, be- 
lieved that any candid woman, whatever may be her ex- 
cuse for late rising, will concede that if she could rise early 
it would be for the advantage of her family. A late break- 
fast puts back the work, through the whole day, for every 
member of a family ; and if the parents thus occasion the 
loss of an hour or two to each individual who, but for 
their delay in the morning, would be usefully employed, 
they alone are responsible for all this waste of time. 

But the practice of early rising has a relation to the gene- 



196 THE EOVSEKEEPEE'S MANUAL. 

ral interests of the social commimity, as well as to that of 
each distinct family. All that great portion of the com- 
munity who are employed in business and labor find it 
needful to rise early; and all their hours of meals, and 
their appointments for business or pleasure, must be accom- 
modated to these arrangements. Now, if a small portion 
of the community establish very different hours, it makes 
a kind of jostling in all the concerns and interests of so- 
ciety. The various appointments for the public, such as 
meetings, schools, and business hours, must be accommodated 
to the mass, and not t^ individuals. The few, then, who 
establish domestic habits at variance with the majority, are 
either constantly interrupted in their own arrangements, or 
else are iaterf eriug with the rights and interests of others. 
This is exemplified in the case of schools. In families 
where late rising is practiced, either hurry, irregularity, 
and neglect are engendered in the family, or else the inte- 
rests of the school, and thus of the community, are sacri- 
ficed. In this, and many other matters, it can be shown 
that the well-being of the bulk of the people is, to a great- 
er or less extent, impaired by this self-indulgent practice. 
Let any teacher select the impimctual scholars — a class who 
most seriously interfere with the interests of the school — 
and let men of business select those who cause them most 
waste of time and vexation, by impunctuality ; and it will 
be found that they are generally among the late risers, 
and rarely among those who rise early. Thus, late rising 
not only injxu'es the person and family which indulge in 
it, but interferes with the rights and convenience of the 
community ; while early rising imparts corresponding ben- 
efits of health, promptitude, vigor of action, economy of 
tmie, and general effectiveness both to the individuals who 
practice it and to the families and community of which 
they are a part. 



XV. 



DOMESTIC MAOTTEES. 



Good majstnees are the expressions of benevolence in 
personal intercourse, by which we endeavor to promote the 
comfort and enjoyment of others, and to avoid all that gives 
needless imeasiness. It is the exterior exhibition of the di 
vine precept, which requires us to do to others as we would 
that they should do to us. It is saying, by our deportment, 
to all around, that we consider their feelings, tastes, and 
conveniences, as equal in value to our own. 

Good manners lead us to avoid all practices which offend 
the taste of others ; all unnecessary violations of the con- 
ventional rules of propriety; all rude and disrespectful 
language and deportment ; and all remarks which would 
tend to wound the feelings of others. 

There is a serious defect in the manners of the American 
people, especially among the descendants of the Puritan 
settlers of New-England, which can nevei be efficiently 
remedied, except in the domestic circle, and during early 
life. It is a deficiency iu the free expressiv n of kindly 
feelings and sympathetic emotions, and a want of courtesy 
in deportment. The causes which have led to this result 
may easily be traced. 

The forefathers of this nation, to a wide exteiit, were 
men who were driven from their native land by laws and 
customs which they believed to be opposed both to civil and 
religious freedom. The sufferings they were called to en- 
dure, the subduing of those gentler feelings which bind us 
to country, kindred, and home ; and the constant subordina- 



198 TEE BOUSEKEEPER-S MANUAL. 

tion of the passions to stern principle, induced characters of ' 
great firmness and self-control. They gave up the comforts 
and refinements of a civilized country, and came as pilgrims 
to a hard soil, a cold clime, and a heathen shore. They 
were continually forced to encounter danger, privations, 
sickness, loneliness, and death ; and all these their religion 
taught them to meet with calmness, fortitude, and submis- 
sion. And thus it became the custom and habit ,f the 
whole mass, to repress rather than to encourage the expres- 
sion of feeling. 

Persons who are called to constant and protracted suffer- 
ing and privation are forced to subdue and conceal emotion ; 
for the free expression of it would double their own suffer- 
ing, and ipcrease the sufferings of others. Those, only, who 
are free from care and anxiety, and whose minds are mainly 
occupied by cheerful emotions, are at full liberty to unvaU 
their feelings. 

It was under such stern and rigorous discipline that the 
first children in New-England were reared ; and the man- 
ners and habits of parents are usually, to a great extent, 
transmitted to children. Thus it comes to pass, that the 
descendants of the Puritans, now scattered over every part' 
of the nation, are predisposed to conceal the gentler emo- 
tions, while their manners are calm, (iecided, and cold, 
rather than free and impulsive. Of course, there are very 
many exceptions to these predominating characteristics. 

Other causes to which we may attribute a general want 
of courtesy in manners are certain incidental results of our 
domestic institutions. Our ancestors and their descendants 
have constantly been combating the aristocratic principle 
which would exalt one class of men at the expense of an- 
other. They have had to contend with this principle, not 
only in civil but in social life. Almost every American, in 
his own person as well as in behalf of his class, has had to 
assume and defend the main principle of democracy — ^that 
every man's feelings and interests are equal in value to 



DOMESTIC MANNERS. igg 

those of every other man. But, in doing this, there has 
been some want of clear discrimination. Because claims 
based on distinctions of mere birth, fortune, or position, 
were found to be injurious, many have gone to the extreme 
of inferring that all distinctions, involving subordinations, 
are useless. Such would wrongfully regard children as 
equals to parents, pupils to teachers, domestics to their em- 
ployers, and subjects to magistrates — and that, too, in all 
respects. 

The fact that certain grades of superiority and subordi- 
nation are needful, both for individual and public benefit, 
has not been clearly discerned ; and there has been a gradual 
tendency to an extreme of the opposite view which has 
sensibly aflfected our manners. All the proprieties and 
courtesies which depend on the recognition of the relative 
duties of superior and subordinate have been warred upon ; 
and thus we see, to an increasing extent, disrespectful treat- 
ment of parents, by children ; of teachers, by pupils ; of 
employers, by domestics ; and of the aged, by the young. 
In all classes and circles, there is a gradual decay in courtesy 
of address. 

In cases, too, where kindness is rendered, it is often ac- 
companied with a cold, unsympathizing manner, which 
greatly lessens its value ; while kindness or politeness is re- 
ceived in a similar style of coolness, as if it were but the 
payment of a just due. 

It is owing to these causes that the American people, 
especially the descendants of the Puritans, do not do them- 
selves justice. For, while those who are near enough to 
learn their real character and feelings can discern the most 
generous impulses, and the most kindly sympathies, they 
are often so vailed behind a composed and indifferent de- 
meanor, as to be almost entirely concealed from strangers. 

These defects in our national manners it especially falls 
to the care of mothers, and all who have charge of the 
Toung, to rectify ; and if they seriously undertake the mat- 



200 TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

ter, and wisely adapt means to ends, these defects will oe 
remedied. With reference to this object, the following 
ideas are suggested. 

The law of Christianity and of democracy, which teaches 
that all men are bom equal in rights, and that their interests 
and feehngs should be regarded as of equal value, seems to 
be adopted in aristocratic circles, with exclusive reference 
to the class in which the iadividual moves. The courtly 
gentleman addresses all of his own class with politeness and 
respect ; and in all his actions, seems to allow that the feel- 
ings and convenience of these others are to be regarded the 
same as his own. But his demeanor to those of inferior 
station is not based on the same rule. 

Among those who make up aristocratic circles, such as 
are above them are deemed of superior, and such as are be- 
low of inferior, value. Thus, if a young, ignorant, and 
vicious coxcomb happens to have been born a lord, the aged, 
the virtuous, the learned, and the well-bred of another class 
must give his convenience the precedence, and must address 
him in terms of respect. So sometimes, when a man of 
" noble birth" is thi'own among the lower classes, he de- 
means himself in a style which, to persons of his own class, 
would be deemed the height of assumption and rudeness. 

Now, the principles of democracy require that the same 
courtesy which we accord to our own circle shall be extend- 
ed to every class and condition ; and that distinctions of su- 
periority and subordination shall depend, not on accidents 
of birth, fortune, or occupation, but solely on those mutual 
relations which the good of all classes equally require. 
The distinctions demanded in a democratic state are sim- 
ply those which result from relations that are common to 
every class, and are for the benefit of all. 

It is for the benefit of every class that children be subor- 
dinate to parents, pupils to teachers, the employed to their 
employers, and subjects to magistrates. In addition to this, 
it is for the general well-being that the comfort or conven- 



DOMESTIC MANNERS. 201 

ience of tlie delicate and feeble should be preferred to that 
of the strong and healthy, who would suffer less by any de- 
privation ; that precedence should be given to their elders 
by the young ; and that reverence should be given to the 
hoary head. 

The rules of good-breeding, in a democratic state, must 
be founded on these principles. It is indeed assumed that 
the value of the happiness of each individual is the same 
as that of every other; but as there must be occasions 
where there are advantages which all can not enjoy, there 
must be general rules for regulating a selection. Otherwise, 
there would be constant scrambling among those of equal 
claims, and brute force must be the final resort ; in which 
case, the strongest would have the best of every thing. The 
democratic rule, then, is, that superiors in age, station, or 
office have precedence of subordinates ; age and feebleness, 
of youth and strength ; and the feebler sex, of more vigor- 
ous man.* 

There is, also, a style of deportment and address which 
is appropriate to these different relations. It is suitable for 
a superior to secure compliance with his wishes from those 
subordinate to him by commands ; but a subordinate must 
secure compliance with his wishes from a superior byre- 
quests. (Although the kind and considerate manner to sub- 
ordinates will always be found the most effective as well as 
the pleasantest, by those in superior station.) It is suitable 
for a parent, teacher, or employer to admonish for neglect 
of duty ; but not for an inferior to adopt such a course to- 
ward a superior. It is suitable for a superior to take pre- 
cedence of a subordinate, without any remark ; but not 
for an inferior, without previously asking leave, or offering 

* The tmiversal practice of this nation, in thus giving precedence to 
woman has been severely commented on by foreigners, and by some who 
•would transfer all the business of the other sex to women, and then have 
them treated like men. But we hope this evidence of our superior civUiza^ 
tion and Christianity may increase rather than diminish. 



202 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

an apology. It is proper for a superior to use language 
and manners of freedom and familiarity, which would be 
improper from a subordinate to a superior. 

The want of due regard to these proprieties occasions a 
great defect in American manners. It is very common to 
hear children talk to their parents in a style proper only 
between companions and equals; so, also, the young ad- 
dress their felders; those employed, their employers; and 
domestics, the members of the faniily and their visitors, 
in a style which is inappropriate to their relative positions. 
But courteous address is required not merely toward supe- 
riors ; every person desires to be thus treated, and therefore 
the law of benevolence demands such demeanor toward all 
whom we meet in the social intercourse of life. " Be ye 
courteous," is the direction of the apostle in reference to 
our treatment of all. 

Good manners can be successfully cultivated only in 
early life and in the domestic circle. There is nothing 
which depends so much upon JiaMt as the constantly recur- 
ring proprieties of good breeding ; and if a child grows up 
without forming such habits, it is very rarely the case that 
they can be formed at a later period. The feeling that it is 
of little consequence how we behave at home if we con- 
duct ourselves properly abroad, is a very fallacious one. 
Persons who are careless and ill-bred at home may ima- 
gine that they can assume good manners abroad ; but they 
mistake. Fixed habits of tone, manner, language, and 
movements can not be suddenly altered ; and those who 
are iU-bred at home, even when they try to hide their bad 
habits, are sure to violate many of the obvious rules of pro. 
priety, and yet be unconscious of it. 

And there is nothing which would so effectually remove 
prejudice against our democratic institutions as the gene- 
ral cultivation of good-breeding in the domestic circle. 
Good manners are the exterior of benevolence, the niinute 
and constant exhibitions of " peace and good-will ;" and the 



DOMESTIC MANNERS. 208 

nation, as well as the individual, whicli most excels in the 
external demonstxation, as well as the internal principle, 
will be most respected and beloved. 

It is only the training of the family state according to 
its true end and aim that is to secure to woman her true 
position and rights. When the family is instituted by mar- 
riage, it is man who is the head and chief magistrate by 
the force of his physical power and requirement of the 
chief responsibility ; not less is he so according to the Chris- 
tian law, by which, when differences arise, the husband 
has the deciding control, and the wife is to obey. " Where 
love is, there is no law ;" but where lovt is not, the only 
dignified and peaceful coujse is for the wife, however much 
his superior, to " submit, as to God and not to man." 

But this power of nature and of religion, given to man 
as the controlling head, involves the distinctive duty of the 
family state, self-sacrificing love. The husband is to " hon- 
or " the wife, to love her as himself, and thus account her 
wishes and happiness as of equal value with his own. But 
more than this, he is to love her " as Christ loved the 
Church ;" that is, he is to " suffer" for her, if need be, in 
order to support and elevate and ennoble her. 

The father then is to set the example of self-sacrifi- 
cing love and devotion ; and the mother, of Christian obe- 
dience when it is required. Every boy is to be trained for 
his future dopiestic position by labor and sacrifices for his 
mother and sisters. It is the brother who is to do the hard- 
est and most disagreeable work, to face the storms and per- 
form the most laborious drudgeries. In the family circle, 
too, he is to give his mother and sister precedence in all 
the conveniences and comforts of home life. 

It is only those nations where the teachings and example 
of Christ have had most influence that man has ever as- 
simaed his obligations of self-sacrificing benevolence in the 
family. And even in Christian communities, the duty of 
wives to obey their husbands has been more strenuously 



204 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

urged than the ohligations of the husband to love his wife 
" as Christ lored the Church." 

Here it is needful to notice that the distinctive duty of 
obedience to man does not rest on women who do not enter 
the relations of married life. A woman who inherits pro- 
perty, or who earns her own livelihood, can institute the 
family state, adopt orphan children and employ suitable 
helpers in training them ; and then to her will appertain the 
authority and rights that belong to man as the head of a 
family. And when every woman is trained to some self-sup- 
porting business, she will not be tempted to enter the fami- 
ly state as a subordinate, except by that love for which there 
is no need of law. 

These general principles being stated, some details in re- 
gard to domestic manners will be enumerated. 

In the first place, there should be required in the family 
a strict attention to the rules of precedence, and those 
modes of address appropriate to the various relations to be 
sustained. Children should always be required to offer 
their superiors, in age or station, the precedence in all com- 
forts and conveniences, and always address them in a re- 
spectful tone and manner. The custom of adding, " Sir," or 
" Ma'am," to " Tes," or " No," is valuable, as a perpetual 
indication of a respectful recognition of superiority. It is 
now going out of fashion, even among the most well bred 
people ; probably from a want of consideration of its im- 
portance. Every remnant of courtesy of address, iu our 
customs, should be carefully cherished, by all who feel a 
value for the proprieties of good breeding. 

If parents allow their children to talk to them, and to 
the grown persons in the f amUy, in the same style in which 
they address each other, it will be in vain to hope for the 
courtesy of manner and tone which good breeding demands 
in the general intercourse of society. In a large family, 
where the elder children are grown up, and the younger 
are small, it is important to require the latter to treat the 



DOMESTIC MANNERS. 205 

elder in some sense as superiors. There are none so ready 
as young children to assume airs of equality ; and if they 
are allowed to treat one class of superiors in age and cha- 
racter disrespectfully, they will soon use the privilege uni- 
versally. This is the reason why the youngest children of 
a family are most apt to be pert, forward, and unmannerly. 

Another point to be aimed at is, to require children al- 
ways to acknowledge every act of kindness and attention, 
either by words or manner. If they are so trained as al- 
ways to make grateful acknowledgments, when receiving 
favors, one of the objectionable features in American man 
ners will be avoided. 

Again, children should be required to ask leave, when- 
ever they wish to gratify curiosity, or use an article which 
belongs to another. And if cases occur, when they can not 
comply with the rules of good-breediag, as, for instance, 
when they must step between a person and the fire, or take 
the chair of an older person, they should be taught either 
to ask leave, or to offer an apology. 

There is another point of good-breeding, which can not, 
in all cases, be understood and applied by children in its 
widest extent. It is that which requires us to avoid all re- 
marks which tend to embarrass, vex, mortify, or in any 
way wound the feelings of another. To notice personal 
defects ; to allude to others' faults, or the faults of their 
friends; to speak disparagingly of the sect or party to 
which a person belongs ; to be inattentive when addressed 
in conversation ; to contradict flatly ; to speak in contemp- 
tuous tones of opinions expressed by another; all these 
are violations of the rules of good-breeding, which children 
should be taught to regard. Under this head comes the 
practice of whispering and staring about, when a teacher, 
or lecturer, or clergyman is addressing a class or audience. 
Such inattention is practically saying that what the person 
is uttering is not worth attending to; and persons of real 
good-breeding always avoid it. Loud talking and laughing 



206 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

in a large assembly, even when no exercises are going on ; 
yawning and gaping in company ; and not' looking in tlie 
face a person who is addressing yon, are deemed marks of 
ill-breeding. 

Another branch of good manners relates to the duties 
of hospitality. Politeness requires us to welcome visitors 
with cordiality ; to offer them the best accommodations ; to 
address conversation to them ; and to express, by tone and 
manner, kindness and respect. Offering the hand to all 
visitors at one's own house is a courteous and hospitable 
custom ; and a cordial shake of the hand, when friends 
meet, would abate much of the coldness of manner ascrib- 
ed to Americans. 

Another point of good breeding refers to the conven- 
tional rules of propriety and good taste. Of these, the 
first class relates to the avoidance of all disgusting or 
offensive personal habits: such as fingering the hair; ob-^ 
trusively using a toothpick, or carrying one in the mouth 
after the needful use of it ; cleaning the nails in presence of 
others ; picking the nose ; spitting on carpets ; snuffing in- 
stead of using a handkerchief, or using the article in an of- 
fensive manner ; lifting up the boots or shoes, as some men 
do, to tend them on the knee, or to finger them : all these 
tricks, either at home or in society, children should be taught 
to avoid. 

Another topic, under this head, may be called tdbh 
manners. To persons of good-breeding, nothing is more 
annoying than violations of the conventional proprieties of 
the table. Reaching over another person's plate; standing up, 
to reach distant articles, instead of asking to have them 
passed ; using one's own knife and spoon for butter, salt, 
or sugar, when it is the custom of the family to provide 
separate utensils for the purpose ; setting cups with the tea 
dripping from them, on the table-cloth, instead of the mats 
or small plates furnished ; using the table-cloth instead of 
the napkins ; eating fast, and in a noisy manner ; putting 



DOMESTIC MANNERS. 201 

large pieces in the mouth ; looking and eating as if very 
hungry, or as if anxious to get at certain dishes ; sittiiig at 
too great a distance from the table, and dropping food; 
laying the knife and fork on the table-cloth, instead of on 
the edge of the plate; picking the teeth at table: all these 
particulars children should be taught to avoid. 

It is always desirable, too, to train children, when at ta- 
ble with grown persons, to be silent, except when addressed 
by others ; or else , their chattering will interrupt the con- 
versation and comfort of their elders. They should always 
be required, too, to wait in silence, till all the older persons 
are helped. 

When children are alone with their parents, it is desirable 
to lead them to converse and to take this as an opportunity 
to form proper conversational habits. But it should be a 
fixed rule that, when strangers are present, the children are 
.to listen in silence and only reply when addressed. Unless 
this is secured, visitors will often be condemned to listen to 
puerile chattering, with small chance of the proper atten- 
tion due to guests and superiors in age and station. 

.Children should be trained, in preparing themselves for 
the table or for appearance among the family, not only to 
put their hair, face, and hands in neat order, but also their 
nails, and to habitually attend to this latter whenever they 
wash their hands. 

There are some very disagreeable tricks which many 
children practice even in families counted well-bred. Such, 
for example, are drumming with the fingers on some piece 
of furniture, or humming a tune while others are talking, 
or interrupting conversation by pertinacious questions, or 
whistling in the house' instead of out-doors, or speaking 
several at once and in loud voices to gain attention. All 
these are violations of good-breeding, which children should 
be trained to avoid, lest they should not only annoy as chil- 
dren, but practice the same kind of ill manners when ma 
ture. In all assemblies for public debate, a chairman or 



208 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

moderator is appointed whose business it is to see that oulj 
one person speaks at a time, that no one interrupts a person 
when speaking, that no needless noises are made, and that 
all indecorums are avoided. Such an officer is sometimes 
greatly needed in family circles. 

Children should be encouraged freely to use limgs and 
limbs out-doors, or in hours for sport in the house; But a1 
other times, in the domestic circle, gentle tones and man- 
ners should be cultivated. The words gentleman and gentle- 
woman came originally from the fact that the uncultivated 
and ignorant classes used coarse and loud tones, and rough 
words and movements ; while only the refined circles habit- 
ually used gentle tones and gentle manners. For the same 
reason, those born in the higher circles were called " of gen- 
tle blood." Thus it came that a coarse and loud voice, and 
rough, ungentle manners, are regarded as vulgar and ple- 
beian. 

All these things should be taught to children, gradually, 
and with great patience and gentleness. Some parents, 
with whom good manners are a great object, are in danger of 
making their children perpetually uncomfortable, by sud- 
denly surrounding them with so many rules that they must 
inevitably violate some one or other a great part of the 
time. It is much better to begin with a few rules, and be 
steady and persevering with these, till a habit is formed, 
and then take a few more, thus making the process easy 
and gradual. Otherwise, the temper of children will be in- 
jured; or, hopeless of fulfilling so many requisitions, they 
will become reckless and indifferent to all. 

If a few brief, well-considered, and sensible rules of good 
manners could be suspended in every school-room, and the 
children all required to commit them to memory, it proba- 
bly would do more to remedy the defects of American 
manners and to advance universal good-breeding tha,n any 
other mode that could be so easily adopted. 

But, in reference to those who have enjoyed advantages 



DOMESTIC MANNERS. 209 

for the cultivation of good maimers, and wto duly estimate 
its importance, one caution is necessary. Those who never 
have had such habits formed in youth are under disadvan- 
tages which no benevolence of temper can altogether remedy. 
They may often violate the tastes and feelings of others, not 
from a want of proper regard for them, but from ignorance 
of custom, or want of habit, or abstraction of mind, or 
from other causes which demand forbearance and sympathy, 
rather than displeasure, An ability to bear patiently with 
defects in manners, and to mate candid and considerate 
allowance for a want of advantages, or for peculiarities in 
mental habits, is one mark of the benevolence of real good- 
breeding. 

The advocates of monarchical and aristocratic institutions 
have always had great plausibility given to their views, by 
the seeming tendencies of our institutions to insubordination 
and bad manners. And it has been too indiscriminately 
conceded, by the defenders of the latter, that such are these 
tendencies, and that the offensive points in American man- 
ners are the necessary result of democratic principles. 

Eut it is believed that both facts and reasoning are in op- 
position to this opinion. The following extract from the 
work of De TocqueviUe, the great political philosopher of 
France, exhibits the opinion of an impartial observer, when 
comparing American manners with those of the English, 
who are confessedly the most aristocratic of all people. 

He previously remarks on the tendency of aristocracy to 
make men more sympathizing with persons of their own 
peculiar class, and less so toward those of lower degree ; 
and he then contrasts American manners with the English, 
claiming that the Americans are much the more affable, 
mild, and social. "In America, where the privileges of 
birth never existed and where riches confer no peculiar 
rights on their possessors, men acquainted with each other are 
very ready to frequent the same places, and find neither peril 
nor disadvantage in the free interchange of their thoughts. 



210 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

If they meet by accident, they neither seek nor avoid inter- 
course ; their manner is therefore natural, frank, and open." 
"If their demeanor is often cold and serious, it is never 
haughty or constrained." But an " aristocratic pride is 
still extremely great among the English ; and as the limits 
of aristocracy are still iU-defined, every body lives in con- 
stant dread, lest advantage should be taken of his famili- 
arity. Unable to judge, at once, of the social position of 
those he meets, an Englishman prudently avoids all contact 
with him. Men are afraid, lest some slight service render- 
ed should draw them into an unsuitable acquaintance; 
they dread civilities, and they avoid the obtrusive gratitude 
of a stranger, as much as his hatred." 

ThuSj/acfe seem to show that when the most aristocratic 
nation in the world is compared, as to manners, with the 
most democratic, the judgment of strangers is in favor of 
the latter. And if good manners are the outward exhibi- 
tion of the democratic principle of impartial benevolence 
and equal rights, surely the nation which adopts this rule, 
both in social and civil life, is the most likely to secure 
the desirable exterior. The aristocrat, by his prmciples, ex- 
tends the exterior of impartial benevolence to his own class 
only ; the democratic principle requires it to be extended 
to all. 

There is reason, therefore, to hope and expect more re- 
fined and polished manners in America than in any other 
land ; while all the developments of taste and refinement, 
such as poetry, music, painting, sculpture, and architecture, 
it may be expected, will come to as high a state of perfec- 
tion here as in any other nation. 

If this country increases in virtue and intelligence, as it 
may, there is no end to the wealth which will pour in as the 
result of our resources of climate, soil, and navigation, and 
the skill, industry, energy, and enterprise of our country- 
men. This wealth, if used as intelligence and virtue die 
fcate, will furnish the means for a superior education to all 



DOMESTIC MANNERS. 211 

classes, and every facility for the refinement of taste, intel- 
lect, and feeling. 

Moreover, in tMs country, labor is ceasing to be the 
badge of a lower class ; so that already it is disreputable 
for a man to be " a lazy gentleman." And this feeling 
must increase, till there is such an equalization of labor as 
will aflford all the time needful for every class to improve 
the many advantages offered to them. Already through 
the munificence of some of our citizens, there are literary 
and scientific advantages offered to all classes, rarely en- 
joyed elsewhere. In most of our large cities and towns, the 
advantages of education, now offered to the poorest classes, 
often without charge, surpass what, some years ago, most 
wealthy men could purchase for any price. And it is be- 
lieved that a time will come when the poorest boy in 
America can secure advantages, which will equal what the 
heir of the proudest peerage can now command. 

The records of the courts of France and Germany, (as 
detailed by the Duchess of Orleans,) in and succeeding the 
brilliant reign of Louis the Fourteenth — a period which 
was deemed the acme of elegance and refinement — exhibit 
a grossness, a vulgarity, and a coarseness, not to be found 
among the very lowest of our respectable poor. And the 
biography of the English Beau Nash, who attempted to re- 
form the manners of the gentry, in the times of Queen 
Anne, exhibits violations of the rules of decency among 
the aristocracy, which the commonest yeoman of this land 
would feel disgraced in perpetrating. 

This shows that our lowest classes, at this period, are 
more refined than were the highest in aristocratic lands, a 
hundred years ago; and another century may show the 
lowest classes, in wealth, in this country, attaining as high 
a polish as adorns those who now are leaders of good man- 
aers in the courts of kings. 



XVI. 

THE PEESEEVATION OF GOOD TEMPEE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER. 

There is nothing whicli has a more abiding influence on 
the happiness of a family than the preservation of equable 
and cheerful temper and tones in the housekeeper. A wo- 
man who is habitually gentle, sympathizing, forbearing, and 
cheerful, carries an atmosphere about her which imparts a 
soothing and sustaining influence, and renders it easier for 
all to do right, under her administration, than in any other 
situation. 

The writer has known families where the mother's pre- 
sence seemed the sunshine of the circle around her ; impart- 
ing a cheering and vivifying power, scarcely realized till it 
was withdrawn. Every one, without thinking of it, or 
knowing why it was so, experienced a peaceful and invigo- 
rating influence as soon as he entered the sphere illumined 
by her smile, and sustained by her cheering kindness and 
sympathy. On the contrary, many a good housekeeper, 
(good in every respect but this,) by wearing a countenance 
of anxiety and dissatisfaction, and by indulging in the fre- 
qiient use of sharp and reprehensive tones, more than de- 
stroys all the comfort which otherwise would result from 
her system, neatness, and economy. 

There is a secret, social sympathy which every mind, to 
a greater or less degree, experiences with the feelings of 
those around, as they are manifested by the coimtenance 
and voice. A sorrowful, a discontented, or an angry coun- 
tenance produces a silent, sympathetic influence, imparting 
a sombre shade to the mind, while tones of anger or com- 
plaint still more efiectually jar the spirits. 



GOOD TEMPER IN TME BOUSEKEEPEB. 213 

No person can maintain a quiet and cheerful frame of 
mind while tones of discontent and displeasm-e are sounding 
on the ear. "We may gradually accustom ourselves to the 
evil till it is partially diminished ; but it always is an evil 
which greatly interferes with the enjoyment of the family 
state. There are sometimes cases where the entrance of 
the mistress of a family seems to awaken a slight appre- 
hension in every mind around, as if each felt in danger of 
a reproof, for something either perpetrated or neglected. A 
woman who should go around her house with a small sting- 
ing snapper, which she habitually applied to those whom 
she met, would be encountered with feelings very much 
like those which are experienced by the inmates of a 
family where the mistress often uses her countenance and 
voice to inflict similar penalties for duties neglected. 

Tet there are many allowances to be made for house- 
keepers, who sometimes imperceptibly and unconsciously 
fall into such habits. A woman who attempts to carry out 
any plans of system, order, and economy, and who has her 
feelings and habits conformed to certain rules, is constantly 
liable to have her plans crossed, and her taste violated, by 
the inexperience or inattention of those about her. And no 
housekeeper, whatever may be her habits, can escape the 
frequent recurrence of negligence or mistake, which inter- 
feres with her plans. 

It is probable that there is no class of persons in the 
world who have such incessant trials of temper, and temp- 
tations to be fretful, as American housekeepers. For 
a housekeeper's business is not, like that of the other 
Bex, limited to a particular department, for which pre- 
vious preparation is made. It consists of ten thousand 
little disconnected items, which can never be so systemati- 
cally arranged that there is no daily jostling somewhere. 
And in the best-regulated families, it is not unfrequently 
the case that some act of forgetfulness or carelessness, from 
some member, will disarrange the business of the whole 



214 



THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 



day, so that every lioiir will bring renewed occasion for an- 
noyance. And the more strongly a woman realizes the 
value of time, and the importance of system and order, the 
more will she be tempted to irritability and complaint. 

The following considerations may aid in preparing a wo- , 
man to meet such daily crosses with even a cheerful tem- 
per and tones. 

In the first place, a woman who has charge of a large 
household should regard her duties as dignified, important, 
and difficult. The mind is so made as to be elevated and 
cheered by a sense of far-reaching influence and usefulness. 
A woman who feels that she is a cipher, and that it makes 
little difference how she performs her duties, has far less to 
sustain and invigorate her, than one who truly estimates 
the importance of her station. A man who feels that the 
destinies of a nation are turning on the judgment and skill 
with which he plans and executes, has a pressure of motive 
and an elevation of feeling which are great safeguards 
against all that is low, trivial, and degrading. 

So, an American mother and housekeeper who rightly 
estimates the long" train of influence which will pass down 
to thousands, whose destinies, from generation to gene- 
ration, vrill be modified by those decisions of her will 
which regulate the temp'er, principles, and habits of her 
family, must be elevated above petty temptations which 
would otherwise assail her. 

Again, a housekeeper should feel that she really has great 
difficulties to meet and overcome. A person who wrongly 
thinks there is little danger, can never maintain so faithful 
a guard as one who rightly estimates the temptations which 
beset her. Nor can one who thinks that they are trifling 
difficulties which she has to encounter, and trivial tempta- 
tions to which she must yield, so much enjoy the just re- 
ward of conscious virtue and self-control as one who takes 
an opposite view of the subject. 

A third method is, for a woman deliberately to calculate 



600D TEMPER IN THE BOUSBKEEPEB. 215 

on having her best-arranged plans interfered with very 
often; and to be in such a state of preparation that the 
evil will not come unawares. So complicated are the pur- 
suits and so diverse the habits of the various members of a 
family, that it is almost impossible for every one to avoid 
interfering with the plans and taste of a housekeeper, in 
some one point or another. It is, therefore, most wise for 
a woman to keep the loins of her mind ever girt, to meet 
such collisions with a cheerful and quiet spirit. 

Another important rule is, to form all plans and arrange- 
ments in consistency with the means at command, and the 
character of those around. A woman who has a heedless 
husband, and young children, and incompetent domestics, 
ought not to make such plans as one may properly form 
who will not, in so many directions, meet embarrassment. 
She must aim at just as much as she can probably attain, 
and no more ; and thus she will usually escape much temp- 
tation, and much of the irritation of disappointment. 

The fifth, and a very important consideration, is, that 
system, economy, and neatness are valuable, only so far as 
they tend to promote the comfort and well-being of those 
afiected. Some women seem to act under the impression 
that these advantages must be secured, at all events, even 
if the comfort of the family be the sacrifice. True, it is 
very important that children grow up in habits of system, 
neatness, and order ; and it is very desirable- that the mo- 
ther give them every incentive, both by precept and example ; 
but it is still more important that they grow up with ami- 
able tempers, that they learn to meet the crosses of life 
with patience and cheerfulness ; and nothing has a greater 
infiuence to secure this than a mother's example. When- 
ever, therefore, a woman can not accomplish her plans of 
neatness and order without injury to her own temper oi 
to the temper of others, she ought to modify and reduce 
them until she can. 

Tlie sixth method relates to the government of the tones 



216 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

of voice. In many cases, wlien a woman's domestic ar- 
rangements are suddenly and seriously crossed, it is impos- 
sible not to feel some irritation. But it is always possible 
to refrain from angry tones. A woman can resolve that, 
whatever happens, she will not speak till she can do it in a 
calm and gentle manner. 'Perfect silence is a safe resort, 
when such control can not be attained as enables a person 
to speak calmly ; and this determination, persevered in, will 
eventually be crowned with success. 

Many persons seem to imagiue that tones of anger are 
needful, in order to secure prompt obedience. But observa- 
tion has convinced the writer that they are never necessary ; 
that vn all cases, reproof, administered in calm tones, would 
be better. A case will be given in illustration. 

A young girl had been repeatedly charged to avoid a 
certaia arrangement in cooking. On one day, when com- 
pany was invited to dine, the direction was forgotten, and 
the consequence was an accident, which disarranged every 
thing, seriously injured the principal dish, and delayed din- 
ner for an hour. The mistress of the family entered the 
kitchen just as it occurred, and at a<glance, saw the extent 
of the mischief. For a moment, her eyes flashed, and her 
cheeks glowed ; but she held her peace. After a minute gr 
80, she gave directions in a calm voice, as to the best mode 
of retrieving the evil, and then left, without a word said to 
the offender. 

After the company left, she sent for the girl, alone, and 
in a calm and kind manner pointed out the aggravations of 
the case, and described the trouble which had been caused 
to her husband, her visitors, and herself. She then por- 
trayed the future evils which would result from such habits 
of neglect and inattention, and the modes of attempting to 
overcome them ; and then offered a reward for the future, 
if , in a given time, she succeeded in improving in this re- 
spect. Not a tone of anger was uttered; and yet the 
severest scolding of a practiced Xantippe could not have 



6001) TEMPER IN TSE HOUSEKEEPER. 217 

secured sucli contrition, and determination to reform, as 
were gained by this method. 

But similar negligence is often visited by a continuous 
stream of complaint and reproof, which, in most cases, is 
met either by sullen silence or impertinent retort, while 
anger prevents any contrition or any resolution of future 
amendment. 

It is very certain, that some ladies do carry forward a 
most efficient government, both of children and domestics, 
without employing tones of anger ; and therefore they are 
not indispensable, nor on any account desirable. 

Though some ladies of intelligence and refinement do 
fall unconsciously into such a practice, it is certainly very 
imlady-like, and in very bad taste, to scold / and the fur- 
ther a woman departs from all approach to it, the more per- 
fectly she sustains her character as a lady. 

Another method of securing equanimity, amid the trials 
of domestic life is, to cultivate a habit of making allowances 
for the difficulties, ignorance, or temptations of those who 
violate rule or neglect duty. It is vain, and most imreason- 
able, to expect the consideration and care of a mature mind 
in childhood and youth ; or that persons of such limited ad- 
vantages as most domestics have enjoyed should practice 
proper self-control and possess proper habits and princi- 
ples. 

Every parent and every employer needs daily to culti- 
vate the spirit expressed in the divine prayer, " Forgive us 
our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." 
The same allowances and forbearance which we supplicate 
from our Heavenly Father, and desire from our fellow-men 
in reference to our own deficiencies, we should constantly 
aim to extend to all who cross our feelings and interfere 
•B-ith our plans. 

The last and most important mode of securing a placid 
and cheerful temper and tones is, by a constant belief in 
the influence of a superintending Providence. All persona 



218 TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

are too mucli in the habit of regarding the more important 
events of life exclusively as under the control of Perfect 
Wisdom. But the fall of a sparrow, or the loss of a hair, 
they do not feel to be equally the result of his directing 
agency. In consequence of this, Christian persons who aim 
at perfect and cheerful submission to heavy afflictions, and 
who succeed to the edificMion of all about them, are 
sometimes sadly deficient under petty crosses. If ,a beloved 
child be laid in the grave, even if its death resulted from the 
carelessness of a domestic or of a physician, the eye is turned 
from the subordinate agent to the Supreme Guardian of all ; 
and to him they bow, without murmur or complaint. But 
if a pudding be burnt, or a room badly swept, or an errand 
forgotten, then vexation and complaint are allowed, just as 
if these events were not appointed by Perfect Wisdom as 
much as the sorer chastisement. 

A woman, therefore, needs to cultivate the habitual feel- 
ing that all the events of her nursery and kitchen are 
brought about by the permission of our Heavenly Father, 
and that fretfulness or complaint in regard to these is, in 
fact, complaining at the appointments of God, and is really 
as sinful as unsubmissive murmurs amid the sorer chastise- 
ments of his hand. And a woman who cultivates this 
habit of referring all the minor trials of life to the wise and 
benevolent agency of a heavenly Parent, and daily seeks. ^ 
his sympathy and aid to enable her to meet them with a 
quiet and cheerful spirit, will soon find it the perennial 
spring of abiding peace and content. 

The power of religion to impart dignity and importance to 
the ordinary and seemingly petty details of domestic life, 
greatly depends upon the degree of faith in the reality of a 
life to come, and of its eternal results. A woman who is 
training a family simply with reference to this life may 
find exalted motives as she looks forward to unborn genera- 
tions whose temporal prosperity and happiness are depend- 
ing upon her fidelity and skill. But one wh ) truly and 



GOOD TEMPER IN TBE BOtJSEKEEFER. 219 

firmly believes that this life is but the beginning of an eter- 
nal career to every immortal inmate of her home, and that 
the formation of tastes, habits, and character, imder her 
care, will bring forth fruits of good or ill, not only through 
earthly generations, but through everlasting ages ; such a 
woman secures a calm and exalted principle of action, 
which no earthly motives can impart. 



HABITS OF SYSTEM AITO OEDEE 

AuT discussion of the equality of tlie sexes, as to inteUeo- 
tual capacity, seems frivolous and useless, both because it 
can never be decided, and because there would be no pos- 
sible advantage in the decision. But one topic, which is 
often drawn into this discussion, is of far more consequence ; 
and that is, the relative importance and difficulty of the 
duties a woman is called to perform. 

It is generally assumed, and almost as generally conceded, 
that a housekeeper's business and cares are contracted and 
trivial ; and that the proper discharge of her duties de- 
mands far less expansion of mind and vigor of intellect 
than the pursuits of the other sex. This idea has prevailed 
because women, as a mass, have never been educated with 
reference to their most important duties ; while that por- 
tion of their employments which is of least value has been 
regarded as the chief, if not the sole, concern of a woman. 
The covering of the body, the convenience of residences, 
and the gratification of the appetite, have been too much 
regarded as the chief objects on which her intellectual 
powers are to be exercised. 

But as society gradually shakes off the remnants of bar- 
barism and the intellectual and moral interests of man rise, 
in estimation, above the merely sensual, a truer estimate is - 
formed of woman's duties, and of the measure of intellect 
requisite for the proper discharge of them. Let any man 
of sense and discernment become the member of a large 



HABITS OF SYSTEM AND ORDER. 221 

household, in whicli a well-educated and pious woman is en- 
deavoring systematically to discharge her multiform duties ; 
let him fully comprehend all her cares, difficulties, and per- 
plexities ; and it is probable he would coincide in the opin- 
ion that no statesman, at the head of a nation's affairs, had 
more frequent calls for wisdom, firmness, tact, discrimina- 
tion, prudence, and versatility of talent, than such a woman. 

She has a husband, to whose peculiar tastes and habits 
she must accommodate herself; she has children whose 
health she must guard, whose physical constitutions she must 
fitudy and develop, whose temper and habits she must 
regulate, whose principles she must form, whose pursuits 
she must guide. She has constantly changing domestics, 
with all varieties of temper and habits, whom she must 
govern, instruct, and direct ; she is required to regulate the 
finances of the domestic state, and constantly to adapt ex- 
penditures to the means and to the relative claims of each 
department. She has the direction of the kitchen, where 
ignorance, forgetfulness, and awkwardness are to be so re- 
gulated that the various operations shall each start at the 
right time, and all be incompleteness at the same given 
hour. She has the claims of society to meet, visits to receive 
and return, and the duties of hospitality to sustain. She 
has the poor to relieve ; benevolent societies to aid ; the 
schools of her children-to inquire and decide about ; the care 
of the sick and the aged ; the nursing of infancy ;. and the 
endless miscellany of odd items, constantly recurring in a 
large family. 

Surely, it is a pernicious and mistaken idea, that the 
duties which tax a woman's mind are petty, trivial, or un- 
worthy of the highest grade of intellect and moral worth. 
Instead of allowing this feeling, every woman should im- 
bibe, from early youth, the impression that she is in train- 
ing for the discharge of the most important, the most dif- 
ficult, and the most sacred and interesting duties that can 
possibly employ the highest intellect. She ought to feel 



222 THE BOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

that hor station and responsibilities in the great drama of 
life are second to none, either as viewed by her Maker, or 
in the estimation of all minds whose judgment is most 
worthy of respect. 

She who is the mother and housekeeper in a large family 
is the sovereign of an empire, demanding more varied 
cares, and involving more difficult duties, than are really 
exacted of her who wears a crown and professedly regu- 
hxtes the interests of the greatest nation on earth. 

There is no one thing more necessary to a housekeeper 
in performing her varied duties, than a habit of system 
and order ; and yet, the peculiarly desultory nature of 
women's pursuits, and the embarrassments resulting from 
the state of domestic service in this country, render it very 
difficult to form such a habit. But it is sometimes the 
case that women who could and would carry forward a 
systematic plan of domestic economy do not attempt it, 
simply from a want of knowledge of the various modes of 
introducing it. It is with reference to such, that various 
modes of securing system and order, which the writer has 
seen adopted, will be pointed out. 

A wise economy is nowhere more conspicuous, than in 
a systematic a/pporUonment of time to different pursuits. 
There are duties of a religious, intellectual, social, and do- 
mestic nature, each having different relative claims on at- 
tention.. Unless a person has some general plan of appor- 
tioning these claims, some will intrench on others, and 
some, it is probable, will be entirely excluded. Thus, some 
find religious, social, and domestic duties so numerous, that 
no time is given to intellectual improvement. Others find 
either social, or benevolent, or religious interests excluded 
by the extent and variety of other engagements. 

It is wise, therefore, for all persons to devise a systematic 
plan, which they will at least keep in view, and aim to 
accomplish ; and by which a proper proportion of time 
shall be secured for all the duties of life. 



HABITS OF SYSTEM AND ORDER. 223 

In forming such a plan, every woman must accommo- 
date herself to the peculiarities of her situation. If she 
has a large family and a small income, she must devote far 
more time to the simple duty of providing food and rai- 
ment than would be right were she in affluence, and with- 
a small family. It is impossible, therefore, to draw out 
any general plan, which all can adopt. But there are 
some general princvples, wliich ought to be the guiding 
rules, when a woman arranges her domestic employments. 
These principles are to be based on Christianity, which 
teaches us to " seek first the kingdom of God," and to 
deem food, raiment, and the conveniences of life, as of 
secondary accoimt. Every woman, then, ought to start 
with the assumption, that the moral and religious interests 
of her family are of more consequence than any worldly 
concern, and that, whatever else may be sacrificed, these 
shall be the leading object, in all her arrangements, in re- 
spect to time, money, and attention. 

It is also one of the plainest requisitions of Christianity, 
that we devote some of our time and efforts to the com- 
fort and improvement of others. There is no duty so con- 
stantly enforced, both in the Old and New Testament, as 
that of charity, in dispensing to those who are desti- 
tute of the blessings we enjoy. In selecting objects of 
charity, the same rule applies to others as to our- 
selves; their moral and religious interests are of the 
highest moment, and for them, as well as for ourselves, 
we are to " seek first the kingdom of God." 

Another general principle is, that our inteUectual and 
social interests are to be preferred to the mere gratifica- 
tion of taste or appetite. A portion of time, therefore, 
must be devoted to the cultivation of the intellect and the 
social affections. 

Another is, that the mere gratification of appetite is 
tb be placed last in our estimate ; so that, when a question 
arises as to which shall be sacrificed, some intellectual, 



224 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

moral, or social advantage, or some gratification of sense, 
we should invariably sacrifice the last. 

As health is indispensable to the discharge of every 
duty, nothing which sacrifices that blessing is to be al- 
lowed in order to gain any other advantage or enjoyment. 
There are emergencies, when it is right to risk health and 
life, to save ourselves and others from greater evils ; but 
these are exceptions, which do not militate against the 
general rule. Many persons imagine that, if they violate 
the laws of health, in order to attend to religious or do- 
mestic duties, they are guiltless before God. But such 
greatly mistake. We directly violate the law, "Thou 
shalt not kill," when we do what tends to risk or shorten 
our own life. The life and happiness of all his creatures 
are dear to our Creator ; and he is as much displeased 
when we injure our own interests, as when we injure 
those of others. The idea, therefore, that we are excusa- 
ble if we harm no one but ourselves, is false and perni- 
cious. These, then, are some general principles, to guide 
a woman in systematizing her duties and pursuits. 

The Creator of all things is a Being of perfect system 
and order ; and, to aid us in our duty in this respect, he 
has divided our time, by a regularly returning day of rest 
from worldly business. In following this example, the in- 
tervening six days may be subdivided to secure similar bene- 
fits. In doing this, a certain portion of time must be given 
to procure the means of livelihood, and for preparing food, 
raiment, and dwellings. To these objects, spme must de- 
vote more, and others less, attention. The remainder of 
time not necessarily thus employed, might be divided 
somewhat in this manner : The leisure of two afternoons 
and evenings could be devoted to religious and benevolent 
objects, such as religious meetings, charitable associations, 
school visiting, and attention to the sick and poor. The 
leisure of two other days might be devoted to intellectual 
improvement, and the pursuits of taste The leisure of 



HABITS OF SYSTEM AND ORDER. 225 

another day inight be devoted to social enjoyments, ii 
making or receiving visits ; and that of another, to mis 
cellaneous domestic pursuits, not included in the othei 
particulars. 

It is probable that few persons could carry out such ai 
arrangement very strictly ; but every one can make a sys 
tematic apportionment of time, and at least avm at accom 
plishing it ; and they can also compare with such a gen 
eral outline, the time which they actually devote to these 
different objects, for the purpose of modifying any mis- 
taken proportions. 

Without attempting any such systematic employment 
of time, and carrying it out, so far as they can control cir- 
cumstances, most women are rather driven along by the 
daily occurrences of life ; so that, instead of being the in- 
telligent regulators of their own time, they are the mere 
sport of circumstances. There is nothing which so dis- 
tinctly marks the difference between weak and strong 
minds as the question, whether they control circumstan- 
ces or circumstances control them. 

It is very much to be feared, that the apportionment of 
time, actually made by most women exactly inverts the 
order required by reason and Christianity. Thus, the 
furnishing a needless variety of food, the conveniences of 
dwellings, and the adornments of dress, often take a larger 
portion of time than is given to any other object. IText 
after this, comes intellectual improvement ; and, last of all, 
benevolence and religion. 

It may be urged, that it is indispensable for most per- 
sons to give more time to earn a livelihood, and to prepare 
food, raiment, and dwellings, than to any other object. 
But it may be asked, how much of the time, devoted to 
these objects, is employed in preparing varieties of food 
not necessary, but rather injurious, and how much is spent 
for those parts of dress and furniture not indispensable, and 
merely ornamental ? Let a woman subtract from her do 



226 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

mestic employments all the time given to pursuits which 
are of no use, except as they gratify a taste for ornament, 
or minister increased varieties to tempt the appetite, and 
she will find that much which she calls " domestic duty," 
and which prevents her attention to intellectual, benevo- 
lent, and religious objects, should be called by a very differ- 
ent name. 

No woman has a right to give up attention to the higher 
interests of herself and others, for the ornaments of person or 
the gratification of the palate. To a certain extent, these 
lower objects are lawful and desirable ; but when they in- 
trude on nobler interests, they become selfish and degrad- 
ing. Every woman, then, when employing her hands in 
ornamenting her person, her children, or her house, ought 
to calculate whether she has devoted as much time to the 
really more important wants of herself and others. If 
she has not, she may know that she is doing wrong, and 
that her system for apportioning her time and pursuits 
should be ajtered. 

Some persons endeavor to systematize their pursuits by 
apportioning them to particular hours of each day. For 
example, a certain period before breakfast, is given to de- 
votional duties ; after-breakfast, certain hours are devoted 
to exercise and domestic employments; other hours, to 
sewing, or reading, or visiting ; and others, to benevolent 
duties. But in most cases, it is more diflScult to system- 
atize the hours of each day, than it is to secure some reg- 
ular division of the week. 

In regard to the minutiae of family work, the writer has 
known the following methods to be adopted. Monday, 
with some of the best housekeepers, is devoted to prepar- 
ing for the labors of the week. Any extra cooking, the 
purchasing of articles to be used during the week, the as- 
sorting of clothes for the wash, and mending such as would 
otherwise be injured — these, and similar items, belong to 
this day. Tuesday is devoted to washing, and Wednesday 



BABIT8 OF SYSTEM AND ORDER. 227 

to ironing. On Thursday, the ironing is finished off, the 
clothes are folded and put away, and all articles which 
need mending are put in the mending-basket, and attended 
to. Friday is devoted to sweeping and house-cleaning. 
On Saturday, and especially the last Saturday of every 
month, every department is put in order ; the casters and 
table furniture are regulated, the pantry and cellar in- 
spected, the trunks, drawers, and closets arranged, and 
every thing about the house put in order for Sunday. By 
this regular recurrence of a particular time for inspecting 
every thing, nothing is forgotten till ruined by neglect. 

Another mode of systematiziug relates to providing 
proper supplies of conveniences, and proper places in 
which to keep them. Thus, some ladies keep a large closet, 
in which are placed the tubs, pails, dippers, soap-dishes, 
starch, blueing, clothes-lines, clothes-pins, and every other 
article used in washing ; and in the same, or another 
place, is kept every convenience for ironing. In the 
sewing department, a trunk, with suitable partitions, is 
provided, in which are placed, each in its proper place, 
white thread of all sizes, colored thread, yarns for mend- 
ing, colored and black sewing-silks and twist, tapes and 
bobbins of all sizes, white and colored welting-cords, silk 
braids and cords, needles of all sizes, papers of pins, rem- 
nants of linen and colored cambric, a supply of all kinds 
of buttons used in the family, black and white hooks and 
eyes, a yard measure, and all the patterns used in cutting 
and fitting. These are done up in separate parcels, and 
labeled. In another trunk, or in a piece-bag, such as has 
been previously described, are kept all pieces used in mend- 
ing, arranged in order. A trunk, like the first mentioned, 
will save many steps, and often much time and perplexity ; 
while by purchasing articles thus by the quantity, they come 
much cheaper than if bought in little portions as they are 
wanted. Such a trunk should be kept locked, and a 
smaller supply for current use retained in a work-basket. 



228 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

A full supply of all conveniences in the kitclien and eel 
lar, and a place appointed for each article, very much fa- 
cilitate domestic labor. For want of this, much vexation 
and loss of time is occasioned while seeking vessels in use, 
or in cleansing those employed by different persons for 
various purposes. It would be far better for a lady to give 
up some expensive article in the parlor, and apply the mo- 
ney thus saved for kitchen conveniences, than to have a 
stinted supply where the most labor is to be performed. 
If our countrywomen would devote more to comfort and 
convenience, and less to show, it would be a great improve- 
ment. Expensive mirrors and pier-tables in the parlor, and 
an unpainted, gloomy, ill-furnished kitchen, not unfrequent- 
ly are found under the same roof. 

Another important item in systematic economy is, the ap- 
portioning of regular employment to the various members 
of a family. If a housekeeper can secure the cooperation 
of all her family, she will find that " many hands make 
light work." There is no greater mistake than in bring- 
ing up childi'en to feel that they must be taken care of, 
and waited on by others, without any corresponding obli- 
gations on their part. The extent to which young chil- 
dren can be made useful in a family would seem surpris- 
ing to those who have never seen a systematic and regular 
plan for utilizing their services. The writer has been in a 
family where a little girl, of eight or nine years of age, 
washed and dressed herself and young brother, and made 
their small beds, before breakfast ; set and cleared all the 
tables for meals, with a little help from a grown person in 
moving tables and spreading cloths ; while all the dusting 
of parlors and chambers was also neatly performed by her. 
A brother of ten years old brought in and piled all the 
wood used in the kitchen and parlor, brushed the boots 
and shoes, went on errands, and took all the care of the 
poultry. They were children whose parents could afford 
to hire servants to do this, but who chose to have tbcir 



HABITS OF STiSTEM 4ND ORDER. 229 

children grow up healthy and industrious, while proper in- 
struction, system, and encouragement made these services 
rather a pleasure than otherwise, to the childi-en. 

Some parents pay their children for such services ; hut 
this is hazardous, as tending to make them feel that they 
are not bound to be helpful without pay, and also as tend- 
ing to produce a hoarding, money-making spirit. But 
where children have no hoarding propensities, and need to ac- 
quire a sense of the vp^lue of property, it may be well to let 
them earn money for some extra services rather as a favor. 
When this is done, they should be taught to spend it for 
others, as well as for themselves ; and in this way, a gen- 
erous and liberal spirit will be cultivated. 

There are some mothers who take pains to teach their 
boys most of the domestic arts which their sisters learn. The 
writer has seen boys mending their own garments and 
aiding their mother or sisters in the kitchen, with great skill 
and adroitness ; and, at an early age, they usually very much 
relish joining in such occupations. The sons of such mothers, 
in their college life, or in roaming about the world, or in 
nursing a sick wife or infant, find occasion to bless the fore- 
thought and kindness which prepared them for such emergen- 
cies. Few things are in worse taste than for a man needless- 
ly to busy himself in women's work ; and yet a man never 
appears in a more interesting attitude than when, by skill 
in such matters, he can save a mother or wife fi'om care 
and suffering. The more a boy is taught to use his hands, 
in every variety of domestic employment, the more his facul- 
ties, both of mind and body, are developed ; for mechanical 
pursuits exercise the intellect as well as the hands. The 
early training of New-England boys, in which they turn 
their hand to almost every thing, is one great reason of the 
quick perceptions, versatility of mind, and mechanical skill, 
for which that portion of our countrymen is distinguished. 
It is equally important that young girls should be taught 
to do son-xC species of handicraft that generally is done by 



230 THE EOVSBKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

men, and especially witli reference to the frequent emi- 
gration to new territories where well-trained mechanics are 
scarce. To hang wall-paper, repair locks, glaze windows, 
and mend various household articles, requires a skill in tlie 
use of tools which every young girl should acquire. If she 
never has any occasion to apply this knowledge and skill 
by her own hands, she will often find it needful ia direct- 
ing and superintending incompetent workmen. 

The writer has known one mode of systematizing the aid 
of the older children in a family, which, in some cases of 
very large families, it may be well to imitate. In the case 
referred to, when the oldest daughter was eight or nine 
years old, an infant sister was given to her, as her special 
charge. She tended it, made and mended its clothes, taught 
it to read, and was its nurse and guardian, through all its 
childhood. Another infant was given to the next daugh- 
ter, and thus the children were all paired in this interest- 
ing relation. In addition to the relief thus afforded to the 
mother, the elder children were in this way qualified for 
their future domestic relations, and both older and younger 
bound to each other by peculiar ties of tenderness and grati- 
tude. 

In offering these examples of various modes of systema- 
tizing, one suggestion may be worthy of attention. It is 
not unfrequently the case, that ladies, who find themselves 
cumbered with oppressive cares, after reading remarks on 
the benefits of system, immediately commence the task of 
arranging their pursuits, with great vigor and hope. They 
divide the day into regular periods, and give each hour its 
dn ty ; they systematize their work, and endeavor to bring 
every thing into a regular routine. But, in a short time, 
they find themselves bafiled, discouraged, and disheartened, 
and finally relapse into their former desultory ways, in a 
sort of resigned despair. 

The difficulty, in such cases, is, that they attempt too 
much at a time. There is nothing which so much depends 



HABITS OF SYSTEM AND ORDER. 231 

apou habit, as a systematic mode of performing duty ; and 
wliere no such habit has been formed, it is impossible for a 
novice to start, at once, into a universal mode of system- 
atizing, which none but an adept could carry through. 
The only way for such persons is to begin with a little 
at a time. Let them select some three or four things, 
and resolutely attempt to conquer at these points. In 
time, a habit wHl be formed, of doing a few things at re- 
gular periods, and in a systematic way. Then it will be 
easy to add a few more ; and thus, by a gradual process, 
the object can be secured, which it w.ould be vain to at- 
tempt by a more summary course. 

Early rising is almost an indispensable condition to suc- 
cess, in such an effort ; but where a woman lacks either the 
health or the energy to secure a period for devotional du- 
ties before breakfast, let her select that hour of the day in 
which she wiU be least liable to interruption, and let her then 
seek strength and wisdom from the only true Source. At 
this time, let her take a pen, and make a list of all the 
things which she considers as duties. Then, let a calcula- 
tion be made, whether there be time enough, in the day or 
the week, for all these duties. If there be not, let the least 
important be stricken from the list, as not being duties, and 
therefore to be omitted. In doing this, let a woman remem- 
ber that, though " what we shall eat, and what we shall 
drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed," are matters 
requiring due attention, they are very apt to obtain a 
wrong relative importance, while intellectual, social, and 
moral interests receive too little regard. 

In this country, eating, dressing, and household furni- 
ture and ornaments, take far too large a place in the esti- 
mate of relative importance ; and it is probable that most 
women could modify their views and practice, so as to come 
nearer to the Saviour's requirements. No woman has a 
right to put a stitch of ornament on any article of dress or 
furniture, or to provide one superfluity in food, until she 



232 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

is sm-e she can secure time for all hef social, intellectual, 
benevolent, and religious duties. K a woman will take the 
trouble to make such a calculation as this, she will usually 
find that she has time enough to perform aU her duties 
easily and weU. 

It is impossible for a conscientious woman to secure that 
peaceful mind and cheerful enjoyment of life which all 
should seek, who is constantly finding her duties jarring 
with each other, and much remaining undone, which she 
feels that she ought to do. In consequence of this, there 
wiU be a secret uneasiness, which will throw a shade over 
the whole current of life, never to be removed, till she so 
efficiently defines and regulates her duties that she can 
fulfiU them all. 

And here the writer would urge upon young ladies the 
importance of forming habits of .system, while unembar- 
rassed with those multiplied cares which will make the 
task so much more difficult and hopeless. Every young 
lady can systematize her pursuits, to a certain extent. She 
can have a particular day for mending her wardrobe, and 
for arranging her trunks, closets, and drawers. She can 
keep her work-basket, her desk at school, and all her other 
conveniences, in their proper places, and in regular order. 
She can have regular periods for reading, walking, visiting, 
study, and domestic pursuits. And by following this 
method in youth, she will form a taste for regularity and a 
habit of system, which will prove a blessing to her through 
life.

GIVING IN CHAEITT. 

It is probable that there is no point of duty whereon 
conscientions persons differ more in opinion, or where they 
find it more difficvdt to form discriminating and decided 
views, than on the matter of charity. That we are bound 
to give some of our time, money, and efforts, to relieve the 
destitute, all allow. But, as to how much we are to give, 
and on whom our charities shall be bestowed, many a re- 
flecting mind has been at a loss. Yet it seems very desir- 
able that, in reference to a duty so constantly and so stren- 
uously urged by the Supreme Kuler, we should be able so 
to fix metes and bounds, as to keep a conscience void of 
offense, and to free the mind from disquieting fears of de- 
ficiency. 

The writer has found no other topic of investigation so 
beset with difficulty, and so absolutely without the range of 
definite rules which can apply to all, in all circumstances. 
But on this, as on previous topics, there seem to be general 
'principles, by the aid of which any candid mind, sincerely 
desirous of obeying the commands of Christ, however much 
self-denial may be involved, can arrive at definite conclu- 
sions as to its own individual obligations : so that when 
these are fulfilled, the mind may be at peace. 

But for a mind that is worldly, living mainly to seek its 
own pleasures instead of living to please God, no principles 
can be so fixed as not to leave a ready escape from all obli- 
gation. Such minds, either by indolence (and consequent 
ignorance) or by sophistry, will convince themselves that a 



234 THE EOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

life of engrossing self-indulgence, with perhaps the gift of 

a few dollars and a few hours of time, may suflSce to fulfill 

the requisitions of the Eternal Judge. 
For such minds, no reasonings will avail, till the heart is 

so changed that to learn the will and follow the example 
of Jesus Christ become the leading objects of interest and 
effort. It is to aid those who profess to possess this temper 
of mind that the following suggestions are offered. 

The first consideration which gives definiteness to this 
subject is a correct view of the object for which we are 
placed in this world. A great many, even of professed Chris- 
tians, seem to be acting on the supposition that the object 
of life is to secure as much as possible of all the various en- 
joyments placed within reach. Not so teaches reason or 
revelation. From these we learn that, though the happi- 
ness of his creatures is the end for which God created and 
sustains them, yet this happiness depends not on the vari- 
ous modes of gratification put within our reach, but mainly 
on character. A man may possess all the resources for en- 
joyment which this world can afford, and yet feel that " all 
is vanity and vexation of spirit," and that he is supremely 
wretched. Another may be in want of all things, and yet 
possess that living spring of benevolence, faith, and hope, 
which will make an Eden of the darkest prison. 

In order to be perfectly happy, man must attain that 
character which Christ exhibited ; and the nearer he ap- 
proaches it, the more will happiness reign in his breast. 

But what was the grand peculiarity of the character of 
Christ ? It was self-denying ienevolenoe. He came not to 
" seek his ovm ;" He " went about doing good," and this 
was his " meat and drink ;" that is, it was this which sus- 
tained the health and life of his mind, as food and drink 
sustain the health and life of the body. Now, the mind oi 
man is so made that it can gradually be transformed into 
the same likeness. A selfish being, who, for a whole life, 
has been nourishing habits of indolent self-indulgence, can 



GIVING IN CHABITT. 235 

by taking Christ as his example, by commtmion with him, 
and by daily striving to imitate his character and conduct, 
form such a temper of mind that " doing good " will be- 
come the chief and highest source of enjoyment. And this 
heavenly principle will grow stronger and stronger, nntil 
self-denial loses the more painful part of its character ; and 
then, living to mahe happiness will be so delightful and 
absorbing a pursuit, that all exertions, regarded as the 
means to this end, will be like the joyous efforts of men 
when they strive for a prize or a crown, with the full hope 
of success. 

In this view of the subject, efforts and seli-denial for the 
good of others are to be regarded not merely as duties en- 
joined for the benefit of others, hut as the moral training 
indispensable to the formation of that character on which 
depends our own happiness. This view exhibits the full 
meaning of the Saviour's declaration, " How hardly shall 
they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !" 
He had before taught that the kingdom of heaven consist- 
ed not in such enjoyments as the worldly seek, but in 
the temper of self-denying benevolence, like his own ; and 
as the rich have far greater temptations to indolent self-in- 
dulgence, they are far less likely to acquire this temper than 
those who, by limited means, are inured to some degree of 
self-denial. 

But on this point, one important distinction needs to be 
made ; and that is, between the self-denial which has no 
other aim than mere self-mortification, and that which is 
exercised to secure greater good to ourselves and others. 
The first is the foundation of monasticism, penances, and 
all other forms of asceticism ; the latter, only, is that which 
Christianity requires. 

A second consideration, which may give definiteness to 
this subject, is, that the formation of a perfect character in- 
volves, not the extermination of any principles of our na- 
ture, but rather the regulating of them, according to the 



236 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

ni]es of reason and religion ; so that the lower propensities 
shall always he kept suhordinate to nohler principles. Thus 
we are not to aim at destroying our appetites, or at need- 
lessly denying them, but rather so to regulate them that 
they shall best secure the objects for which they were im- 
planted. "We are not to annihilate the love of praise and 
admiration ; but so to control it that the favor of God shall 
be regarded more than the estimation of men. We are not 
to extirpate the principle of curiosity, which leads us to 
acquire knowledge ; but so to direct it, that all our acqui- 
sitions shall be usefiil and not frivolous or injurious. And 
thus with all the principles of the mind : God has implant- 
ed no desires in our constitution which are evil and per- 
nicious. On the contrary, all our constitutional propensi- 
ties, either of mind or body, he designed we should grat- 
ify, whenever no evils would thence result, either to our- 
selves or others. Such passions as envy, selfish ambition, 
contemptuous pride, revenge, and hatred, are to be exter- 
minated ; for they are either excesses or excrescences, not 
created by God, but rather the result of our own neglect 
to form habits of benevolence and self-control. 

In deciding the rules of our conduct, therefore, we are 
ever to bear in mind that the development of the nobler 
principles, and the subjugation of inferior propensities to 
them, is to be the main object of effort both for ourselves 
and for others. And in conformity with this, in all our 
plans we are to place religious and moral interests as first 
in estimation, our social and intellectual interests next, and 
our physical gratifications as subordinate to all. 

A third consideration is that, though the means for sus 
taining life and health are to be regarded as necessaries, 
without which no other duties can be performed, yet a very 
large portion of the time spent by most persons in easy 
circumstances for food, raiment, and dwellings, is for 
mere superfluities ; which are right when they do not in- 
volve the sacrifice of highe" interests, and wrong when 



GIVING IN CHABITT. 237 

they do. Life and health can be sustained in the humblest 
dwellings, with the plainest dress, and the simplest food ; 
and, after taking from our means what is necessary for life 
and health, the remainder is to be so divided, that the 
larger portion shall be given to supply the moral and in- 
tellectual wants of ourselves and others, together with the 
physical requirements of the destitute, and the smaller 
share to procure those additional gratifications of taste 
and appetite which are desirable but not indispensable. 
Mankind, thus far, have never made this apportionment 
of their means ; although, just as fast as they have risen 
from a savage state, mere physical wants have been made, 
to an increasing extent, subordinate to higher objects. 

Another very important consideration is that, in urging 
the duty of charity and the prior claims of mo^al and re- 
ligious objects, no rule of duty should be maintained 
which it would not be right and wise for all to follow. 
And we are to test the wisdom of any general rule by in- 
quiring what ■W^ould be the result if all mankind should 
practice according to it. In view of this, we are enabled 
to judge of the correctness of those who maintain that, to 
be consistent, men believing in the perils of all those of our 
race who are not brought under the influence of the Chris- 
tian system should give up not merely the elegancies 
but all the superfluities of life, and devote the whole of 
their means not indispensable to life and health to the 
propagation of Christianity. 

But if this is the duty of any, it is the duty of all ; and 
we are to inquire what would be the result, if all con- 
scientious persons gave up the use of all superfluities. 
Suppose that two millions of the people of the United 
States were conscientious persons, and relinquished the U6e 
of every thing not absolutely necessary to life and health. 
Besides reducing the education of the people 'in all the 
higher walks of intellectual, social, and even moral deve- 
lopment, to very narrow limits, it would instantly throw 



238 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

out of employment one lialf of tlie whole communitj'. The 
writers, book-makers, manufacturers, mechanics, merchants, 
agriculturists, and all the agencies they employ, would be 
beggared, and one half of those not reduced to poverty 
would be obliged to spend all their extra means in simply 
supplying necessaries to the other half. The use of super- 
fluities, therefore, to a certain extent, is as indispensable 
to promote industry, virtue, and religion, as any direct 
giving of money or time ; and it is owing entirely to a 
want of reflection and of comprehensive views, that any 
me:, ever make so great a mistake as is here exhibited. 

Instead, then, of urging a rule of duty which is at once 
irrational and impracticable, there is another course, which 
commends itself to the understandings of all. For what- 
ever may be the practice of intelligent men, they univer- 
sally concede the principle, that our physical gratifications 
should always be made subordinate to social, intellectual, 
and moral advantages. And all that is required for the 
advancement of our whole race to the most perfect state 
of society is, simply, that men should act in agreement 
with this principle. And if only a very small portion of 
the most intelligent of our race should act according to 
this rule, under the control of Christian benevolence, the 
immense supplies furnished for the general good would be 
far beyond what any would imagine who had never made , 
any calculations on the subject. In this nation alone, 
suppose the one million and more of professed followers 
of Christ should give a larger portion of their means for 
the social, intellectual, and moral wants of mankind, 
than for the superfluities that minister to their own taste, 
convenience, and appetite ; it would be enough to furnish 
all the schools, colleges, Bibles, ministers, and missionaries, 
that the whole world could demand ; or, at least, it would 
be far more than properly qualified agents to administer 
it co^ild employ. 

Eut it may be objected that, though this view in the 



OIVUfG IN CSARITT. 23'9 

abstract looks plausible and rational, not one in a thousand 
can practically adopt it. How few keep any account, at 
all, of their current expenses! How impossible it is to de- 
teiinine, exactly, what are necessaries and what are super- 
fluities ! And in regard to women, how few have the con- 
trol of an income, so as not to be bound by the wishes of 
a parent or a husband ! 

In reference to these difficulties, the first remark is, that 
we are never under obligations to do what is entirely out 
of our power ; so that those persons who can not regu- 
late their expenses or their charities are under no sort of 
obligation to attempt it. The second remark is that, when 
a rule of duty is discovered, if we can not fully attain to it, 
we are bound to aim at it, and to fulfill it just so far as we 
can. "We have no right to throw it aside because we shall 
find some difficult cases when we come to apply it. The 
third 'remark is, that no person can tell how much can be 
done, till a faithful trial has been made. If a woman has 
never kept any accounts, nor attempted to regulate her 
expenditures by the right rule, nor used her infiuence with 
those that control her plans, to secure this object, she has 
no right to say how much she can or can not do, till after 
a fair trial has been made. 

In attempting such a trial, the following method can be 
taken. Let a woman keep an account of all she spends, for 
herself and her family, for a year, arranging the items un- 
der three general heads. Under the first, put all articles 
of food, raiment, rent, wages, and all conveniences. Under 
the second, place all sums paid in securing an education, 
and books, and other intellectual advantages. Undei the 
third . head, place all that is spent for benevolence and re- 
ligion. At the end of the year, the first and largest ac- 
count will show the mixed items of necessaries and super- 
fluities, which can be arranged so as to gain some sort of 
idea how much has been spent for superfluities and how 
much for necessaries. Then, by comparing what is spent 



240 TEE EOUSEKSEPEE'S MANUAL. 

for superfluities, with what is spent for intellectual and 
moral advantages, data will be gained for judging of the 
past and regulating the future. 

Does a woman say she can not do this ? let her think, 
whether the offer of a thousand dollars, as a reward for at- 
tempting it one year, would not make her undertake to do 
it ; and if so, let her decide, in her own mind, which is 
most valuable, a clear conscience, and the approbation of 
God, in this effort to do his will, or one thousand dollars. 
And let her do it, with this warning of the Saviour before 
her eyes — " No man can serve two masters." " Te can 
not serve God and Mammon." 

Is it objected, How can we decide between superfluities 
and necessities, in this list ? It is replied, that we are not 
required to judge exactly, in all cases. Our duty is, to use 
the means in our power to assist us in forming a correct 
judgment ; to seek the divine aid in freeing our minds 
from indolence and selfishness ; and then to judge, as well 
as we can, in our endeavors rightly to apportion and regu- 
late our expenses. Many persons seem to feel that they 
are bound to do better than they know how. But God is 
not so hard a master ; and after we have used all proper 
means to learn the right way, if we then follow it accord- 
ing to our ability, we do wrong to feel misgivings, or to 
blame ourselves, if results come out differently from what, 
seems desirable. 

The results of our actions, alone, can never prove us de- 
serving of blame. For men are often so placed that, owing 
to lack of intellect or means, it is impossible for them to 
decide correctly. To use all the means of knowledge with- 
in our reach, and then to judge, with a candid and con- 
scientious spirit, is all that God requires ; and when we 
have done this, and the event seems to ' come out wrong, 
we should never wish that we had decided otherwise. For 
this would be the same as wishing that we had not fol- 
lowed the dictates of judgment and conscience. As this 



0IVme JJV CHABITT. a4i 

is a world douigned for discipline and trial, untoward 
events are never to be construed as indications of the obli- 
quity of our past decisions. 

But it is probable that a great portion of the women of 
this nation can not secure any such systematic mode of re- 
gulating their expenses. To such, the writer would pro- 
pose one inquiry : Can not you calculate how much time 
and money you spend for what is merely ornamental, and 
not necessary, for yourself, your children, and your house ? 
Can not you compare this with the time and money you 
spend for intellectual and benevolent purposes ? and will 
not this show the need of some change ? In making this 
examination, is not this brief rule, deducible from the 
principles before laid down, the one which should regulate 
you ? Every person does right in spending some portion 
of time and means in securing the conveniences and adorn- 
ments of taste ; but the amount should never exceed what 
is spent in securing our own moral and intellectual im- 
provement, nor what is spent in benevolent efforts to sup- 
ply the physical and moral wants of our fellow-men. 

In mating an examination on this subject, it is some- 
times the case that a woman will count among the neces- 
sa/ries of life all the various modes of adorning the person 
or house, practiced in the circle in which she moves ; and, 
after enumerating the many duties which demand atten- 
tion, counting these as a part, she will come to the conclu- 
sion that she has no time, and but little money, to devote 
to personal improvement or to benevolent enterprises. 
This surely is not in agreement with the requirements of 
the Saviour, who calls on us to seek for others, as well as 
ourselves, ji/rst of all, " the kingdom of God, and his right- 
eousness." 

In order to act in accordance with the rule here pre- 
sented, it is true that many would be obliged to give up 
the idea of conforming to the notions and customs of those 
with whom they associate, and compelled to adopt the 



242 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

maxim, " Be not conformed to this world." In many cases, 
it would involve an entire change in the style of living. 
And the writer has the happiness of knowing more cases 
than one, where persons who have come to similar views 
on this subject, have given up large and expensive estab- 
lishments, disposed of their carriages, dismissed a portion 
of their domestics, and modified all their expenditures, 
that they might keep a pure conscience, and regulate their 
charities more according to the requirements of Christian- 
ity. And there are persons, well known in the religious 
world, who save themselves all labor of minute calculation, 
by devoting so large a portion of their time and means to 
benevolent objects, that they find no difficulty in knowing 
that they give more for religious, benevolent, and intellec- 
tual purposes than for superfluities. 

In deciding what particular objects shall receive our 
benefactions, there are also general principles to guide us. 
The first is that presented by our Saviour, when, after 
urging the great law of benevolence, he was asked, " And 
who is my neighbor ?" His reply, in the parable of " the 
Good Samaritan," teaches us that any human being whose 
wants are brought to our knowledge is our neighbor. The 
wounded man in that parable was not only a stranger, but 
he belonged to a foreign nation, peculiarly hated ; and he 
had no claim, except that his wants were brought to the 
knowledge of the wayfaring man. From this we learn 
that the destitute of all nations become our neighbors, p.a 
soon as their wants are brought to our knowledge. 

Another general principle is this, that those who are most 
in need must be relieved in preference to those who are 
less destitute. On this principle it is, that we think the 
followers of Christ should give more to supply those who 
are suffering for want of the bread of eternal life, than for 
those who are deprived of physical enjoyments. And an- 
other reason for this preference is the fact that many who 
give in charity have made such imperfect advances in civil- 



GIVING m CKAHITT. 243 

ization and Christianity that the intellectual and moral 
wants of our race make but a feeble impression on the mind. 
Relate a pitiful tale of a family reduced to live for weeks 
on potatoes only, and many a mind would awake to deep 
sympathy and stretch forth the hand of charity. But de- 
scribe cases where the immortal mind is pining in stupidity 
and ignorance, or racked with the fever of baleful passions, 
and how small the number so elevated in sentiment and 
60 enlarged in their views as to appreciate and sympathize 
in these far greater misfortunes ! The intellectual and 
moral wants of our fellow-men, therefore, should claim the 
first place in general Christian attention, both because they 
are most important, and because they are most neglected ; 
while it should not be forgotten, in giving personal atten- 
tion to -the wants of the poor, that the relief of immediate 
physical distress, is often the easiest way of touching the 
moral sensibilities of the destitute. 

Another consideration to be borne in mind is that, in 
this country, there is much less real need of charity in 
supplying physical necessities than is generally supposed 
by those who have not learned the more excellent way. 
This land is so abundant in supplies, and labor is in such 
demand, that every healthy person can earn a comfortable 
support.- And if all the poor were instantly made virtuous, 
it 'is probable that there would be few physical wants 
which could not readily be supplied by the immediate 
friends of each sufferer. The sick, the aged, and the orphan 
would be the only objects of charity. In this view of the 
case, the primary effort in relieving the poor should be to 
furnish them the means of earning their own support, and 
to supply them with those moral influences which are most 
effectual in securing virtue and industry. 

Anotiier point to be attended to is the importance ot 
maintaining a system of assodated charities. There is no 
point in which the economy of charity has more improved 
than in the present mode of combining many small contri 



244 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

butions, for sustaining enlarged and systematic plans of 
charity. If all the half-dollars which are now contributed 
to aid in organized systems of charity were returned to the 
donors, to be applied by the agency and discretion of each, 
thousands and thousands of the treasures, now employed to 
promote the moral and intellectual wants of mankind, 
would become entirely useless. In a democracy like ours, 
where few are very rich and the majority are in comfort- 
able circumstances, this collecting and dispensing of drops 
and rills is the mode by which, in imitation of nature, 
the dews and showers are to distill on parched and desert 
lands. And every person, while earning a pittance to unite 
with many more, may be cheered with the consciousness of 
sustaining a grand system of operations which must have 
the most decided influence in raising all mankind to that 
perfect state of society which Christianity is designed to 
bring about. 

Another consideration relates to the indiscriminate be- 
stowal of charity. Persons who have taken pains to inform 
themselves, and who devote their wKoletime to dispensing 
charities, unite in declaring that this is one of the most fruit- 
fill sources of indolence, vice, and poverty. From several 
of these the writer has learned that, by their own personal 
investigations, they have ascertained that there are large 
establishments of idle and wicked persons in most of our 
cities, who associate together to support themselves by 
every species of imposition. They hire large houses, and 
live in constant rioting on the means thus obtained. Among 
them are women who have or who hire the use of infant 
children ; others, who are blind, or maimed, or deformed, or 
who can adroitly feign such infirmities; and, by these 
means of exciting pity, and by artful tales of woe, they col- 
lect alms, both in city and country, to spend in all manner 
of gross and guilty indulgences. Meantime many persons, 
finding themselves often duped by impostors, refuse to give 
at all ; and thus many benefactions are withdrawn, which 



&IVING IN CHARITY. 245 

a wise economy in charity would have secured. For this 
and other reasons, it is wise and merciful to adopt the gen- 
eral rule, never to give alms till we have had some oppor- 
tunity of knowing how they will be spent. There are ex- 
ceptions to this, as to every general rule, which a person 
of discretion can determine. But the practice so common 
among benevolent persons, of giving at least a trifle to all 
who ask, lest perchance they may turn away some who are 
really sufierers, is one which causes more siii and misery 
than it cures. 

The writer has never known any system for dispensing 
charity so successful as the one by which a town or city is 
divided into districts ; and each district is committed to the 
care of two ladies, whose duty it is, to call on each family 
and leave a book for a child, or do some other deed of neigh- 
borly kindness, and make that the occasion for entering into 
conversation, and learning the situation of all residents in 
the district. By this method, the ignorant, the vicious, and 
the poor are discovered, and their physical, intellectual, and 
moral wants are investigated. In some places where the 
writer has known this mode pursued, each person retained 
the same district, year after year, so that every poor family in 
the place was under the watch and care of some intelKgent 
and benevolent lady, who used all her influence to secure a 
proper education for the children, to famish them with suit- 
able reading, to encourage habits of industry and economy, 
and to secure regular attendance on public religious in- 
struction. Thus, the rich and the poor were brought in 
contact, in a way advantageous to both parties ; and if such 
a system could be universally adopted, more would be done 
for the prevention of poverty and vice than all the wealth 
of the nation could avail for their relief. But this plan can 
not be successfully carried out, in this manner, unless there 
is a large proportion of intelligent, benevolent, and self- 
denying persons, who unite in a systematic plan. 
But there is one species of " qharity " which needs espe- 



246 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

cial consideration. It is that spirit of kindly love which 
induces us to refrain from judging of the means and the rela- 
tive charities of other persons. There have been such in- 
distinct notions, and so many different standards of duty, 
on this subject, that it is rare for two persons to think ex- 
actly alike, in regard to the rule of duty. Each person is 
bound to inquire and judge for himself, as to his own duty 
or deficiencies ; but as both the resources and the amount of 
the actual charities of others are beyond our ken, it is as 
indecorous as it is uncharitable to sit in judgment on their 
decisions. 



XIX. 

ECONOMY OF TIME AND EXPENSES. 

The value of time, and our obKgation to spend every hour 
for some useful end, are what few minds properly realize. 
And those who have the highest sense of their obligations 
in this respect, sometimes greatly misjudge in their estimate 
of what are useful and proper modes of employing time. 
This arises from limited views of the importance of some 
pursuits, which they would deem frivolous and useless, but 
which are in reality necessary to preserve the health of body 
and mind and those social affections which it is very im- 
portant to cherish. 

Christianity teaches that, for aU the time afforded us, we 
must give account to God ; and that we have no right to 
waste a single hour. But time which is spent in rest or 
amusement is often as usefully employed as if it were de- 
voted to labor or devotion. In employing our time, we are 
to make suitable allowance for sleep, for preparing and tak- 
ing food, for securing the means of a livelihood, for intel- 
lectual improvement, for exercise and amusement, for social 
enjoyments, and for benevolent and religious duties. And 
it is the right a/pportiouTnent of time, to these various duties, 
which constitutes its true economy. 

In deciding respecting the rectitude of our pursuits, we are 
bound to aim at some practical good, as the ultimate object. 
With every duty of this life, our benevolent Or'eator has 
connected some species of enjoyment, to draw us to perform 
it. Thus, the palaite is gratified, by performing the duty of 



248 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

aourishing our bodies ; the principle of curiosity is gratified 
in pursuing useful knowledge ; the desire of approbation is 
gratified, when we perform general social duties ; and every 
other duty has an alluring enjoymenb connected with it. 
But the great mistake of mankiad has consisted m seeking 
the pleasures connected with these duties, as the sole aim, 
without reference to the main end that should be held in 
view, and to which the enjoyment should be made subser- 
vient. Thus, men gratify the palate, without reference to 
the question whether the body is properly nourished : and 
follow after knowledge, without inquiring whether it min- 
isters to good or evil ; and seek amusement without refer- 
ence to results. 

In gratifying the implanted desires of our nature, we are 
bound so to restrain ourselves, by reason and conscience, as 
always to seek the main objects of existence — the highest 
good of ourselves and others ; and never to sacrifice this for 
the mere gratification of our desires. We are to gratify appe- 
tite, just so far as is consistent with health and usefulness ; 
and the desire for knowledge, just so far as will enable us 
to do most good by our influence and efforts ; and no farther. 
We are to seek social intercourse, to that extent which will 
best promote domestic enjoyment and kindly feelings among 
neighbors and friends ; and we are to pursue exercise and 
amusement, only so far as will best sustain the vigor of body 
and mind. 

The laws of the Supreme Ruler, when he became the 
civil as well as the religious Head of the Jewish theocracy, 
furnish an example which it would be well for all atten- 
tively to consider, when forming plans for the apportion- 
ment of time and property. To properly estimate this ex- 
ample, it must be borne in mind, that the main object of 
God was, to set an example of the temporal rewards that 
follow obedience to the laws of the Creator, and at the 
same time to prepare religious teachers to extend the true 
religion to the whole race of man. 



ECONOMY OF TIME AND EXPEA'tiEK 249 

Eefore Christ came, the Jews were not required to go 
forth to other nations as teachers of religion, nor were the 
Jewish nation led to obedience by motives of a life to 
come. To them God was revealed, both as a father and a 
civil ruler, and obedience to laws relating solely to this 
life was all that was required. So low were they in the 
scale of civilization and mental development, that a sys- 
tem which confined them to one spot, as an agricultural 
people, and prevented their growing very rich, or having 
extensive commerce with other nations, was indispensable 
to prevent their relapsing into the low idolatries and vices 
of the nations around them, while temporal rewards and 
penalties were more effective than those of a life to 
come. 

The proportion of time and property, which every Jew 
was required to devote to intellectual, benevolent, and re- 
ligious purposes, was as follows : 

In regard to property, they were required to give one 
tenth of all their yearly income to support the Levites, the 
priests, and the religious service. Next, they were required 
to give the first-fruits of all their corn, wine, oil, and fruits, 
and the first-bom of all their cattle, for the Lord's treasury, 
to be employed for the priests, the widow, the fatherless, 
and the stranger. The first-born, also, of their children, 
were the Lord's, and were to be redeemed by a specified 
sum, paid into the sacred treasury. Besides this, they were 
required to bring a free-wilL offering to God, every time they 
went up to the three great yearly festivals. In addition to this, 
regular yearly sacrifices of cattle and fowls were required 
of each family, and occasional sacrifices for certain sins or 
ceremonial impurities. In reaping their fields, they were 
required to leave unreaped, for the poor, the corners ; not 
to glean their fields, oHveyards, or vineyards ; and, if a 
sheaf was left by mistake, they were not to return for it 
but leave it for the poor. 
One twelfth of the people were set apart, having no land 



250 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

ed property, to be priests and teachers; and the othnr 
tribes were required to support them liberally. 

In regard to the time taken from secular pursuits, fbr the 
support of education and religion, an equally liberal 
amount was demanded. In the first place, one seventh 
part of their time was taken for the weekly sabbath, when 
no kind of work was to be done. Then the whole nation 
were required to meet at the appointed place three times 
a year, which, including their journeys and stay there, oc- 
cupied eight weeks, or another seventh part of their time. 
Then the sabbatical year, when no agricultural labor was 
to be done, took another seventh of their time 'from their 
regular pursuits, as they were an agricultural people. This 
was the amount of time and property demanded by God, 
simply to sustain education, religion, and morality within 
the boimds of one nation. 

It was promised to this nation and falfilled by constant 
miraculous interpositions, that in this life, obedience 
to God's laws should secure health, peace, prosperity, 
and long life ; while for disobedience was threatened war, 
pestilence, famine, and all temporal evils. These promises 
were constantly verified, and in the day of Solomon, when 
this nation was most obedient, the whole world was moved 
with wonder at -its wealth and prosperity. But up to this 
time, no attempt was made by God to govern the Israelites 
by the rewards and penalties of the world to come. 

But " when the fullness of time had come," and the race 
of man was prepared to receive higher responsibilities, 
Jesus Christ came and " brought life and immortality to 
light " with a clearness never before revealed. At the 
same time was revealed the fatherhood of God, not to the Jews 
alone, but to the whole human race, and the consequent 
brotherhood of man ; and these revelations in many respects 
changed the whole standard of duty and obligation. 

Christ came as " God manifest in the flesh," to set an 
example of self-sacrificing love, in rescuing the whole 



ECONOMT OF TIME AND EXPENSES. 251 

family of man from the dangers of the unseen world, and 
also to teach and train his disciples through all time tp fol- 
low his example. And those who conform the most consis- 
tently to his teachings and example will aim at a standard 
of labor and self-denial far beyond that demanded of tho 
Jews. 

It is not always that men understand the economy of 
Providence, in that unequal distribution of property which, 
even under the most perfect form of government, will always 
exist. Many, looking at the present state of things, ima- 
gine that the rich, if they acted in strict conformity to the 
law of benevolence, would share all their property with their 
suffering fellow-men. But such do not take into account the 
inspired declaration that " a man's life consisteth not in the 
abundance of the things which he possesseth," or, in other 
words, life is made valuable, not by great possessions, but 
by such a character as prepares a man to enjoy what he 
holds. God perceives that human character can be most 
improved by that kind of discipline which exists when there 
is something valuable to be gained by industrious efforts. . 
This stimulus to industry could never exist in a communi- 
ty where all are just alike, as it does in a state of society 
where every man sees possessed by others enjoyments 
which he desires and may secure by effort and industry. 
So, in a community where all are alike as to property, 
there would be no chance to gain that noblest of all attain- 
ments, a habit of self-denying benevolence which toils for the 
good of others, and takes from one's own store to increase 
the enjoyments of another. 

Instead, then, of the stagnation, both of industry and of 
benevolence, which would follow the universal and equable 
distribution of property, some men, by superior ad- 
vantages of birth, or intellect, or patronage, come into pos- 
session of a great amount of capital. With these means 
they are enabled, by study, reading, and travel, to secure 
expansion of mind and just views of the relative advantages 



252 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

of moral, intellectual, and physical enjoyments. At the 
same time, Christianity imposes obligations corresponding 
with the increase of advantages and means. The rich are 
not at liberty to spend their treasures chiefly for themselves. 
Their wealth is given, by God, to be employed for the best 
good of mankind ; and their intellectual advantages are de- 
signed, primarily, to enable them to judge correctly in em- 
ploying their means most wisely for the general good. 

Now, suppose a man of wealth inherits ten thousand 
acres of real estate ; it is not his duty to divide it among 
his poor neighbors and tenants. If- he took this course, 
it is probable that most of them would spend all in thrift- ' 
less waste and indolence, or in mere physical enjoyments. 
Instead, then, of thus putting his capital out of his hands, 
he is bouiid to retain and so to employ it as to raise his 
family and his neighbors to such a state of virtue and in- 
telligence that they can secure far more, by their own ef- 
forts and industry, than he, by dividing his capital, could 
bestow upon them. 

In this view of the subject, it is manifest that the unequal . 
distribution of property is no evil. The great difficulty is, 
that so large a portion of those who hold much capital, in-, 
stead of using their various advantages for the greatest 
good of those around them, employ them for mere selfish 
indulgences ; thus inflicting as much mischief on themselves 
as results to others from their culpable neglect. A great 
portion of the rich seem to be acting on the principle 
that the more God bestows on them the less are they under 
obligation to practice any self-denial in fulfilling his benevo- 
lent plan of raising om- race to intelligence and virtue. 

But there are cheering examples of the contrary spirit 
and prejudice, some of which will be here recorded to in- 
fluence and encourage others. 

A lady of great wealth, high position, and elegant 
culture, in one of our large cities, hired and furnished a 
house adjacent to her own, and, securing the aid of another 



ECONOMY OF TIME AND EXPENSES. 253 

benevolent and cultivated woman, took twelve oi-phan girls, 
of different ages, and educated them under their joint care. ' 
Not only time and money were given, but love and labor, 
just as if these were their own children ; and as fast as one 
was provided for, another was taken. 

In another city, a young lady with property of her own 
hired a house and made it a home for homeless and unpro- 
tected women, who paid board when they could earn it, and 
found a refuge when out of employment. 

In another city, the wife of one of its richest merchants, 
living in princely style, took two young girls from the cer- 
tain road to ruin among the vicious poor. She boarded 
them with a respectable farmer, and sent them to school, 
and every week went out, not only to supervise them, but 
to aid in training them to habits of neatness, industry, and 
obedience, just as if they were her own children. Next, 
she hired a large house near the most degraded part of 
the city, furnished it neatly and with all suitable conveni- 
ences to work, and then rented to those among the most 
degraded whom she, could bring to conform to a few simple 
rules of decency, industry, and benevolence — one of these 
rules being that they should pay her the rent every Satur- 
day night. To this motley gathering she became chief 
counselor and friend, quieted their brawls, taught them to 
aid each other in trouble or sickness, and strove to introduce 
among them that law of patient love and kindness, illustrar 
ted by her own example. The young girls in this tenement 
she assembled every Satm'day at her own house — taught 
them to sing, heard them recite their Sunday-school lessons, 
to be sure these were properly learned ; taught them to make 
and mend their own clothing, trimmed their bonnets, and 
took charge of their Sunday dress, that it might always 
be in order. Of course, such benevolence drew a stream of 
ignorance and misery to her door ; and so successful waj 
her labor that she hired a second house, and managed it on 
the same plan. One hot day in August, a friend found her 



254 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

combing the head of a poor, UBgainly, foreign girl. She had 
persuaded a friend to take her from compassion, and she 
was returned because her head was in such in a state. 
Finding no one else to do it, the lady herself bravely met 
the difficulty, and persevered in this daily ministry till the 
evil was remedied, and the poor girl thus secured a comfor- 
table home and wages. 

A young lady of wealth and position, with great musical 
culture and taste, found among the poor two young girls 
with fine voices and great musical talent. Gaining her pa^ 
rents' consent, the young lady took one of them home, trained 
her in music, and saw that her school education was secured, 
so that when expensive masters and instruments were need- 
ed the girl herself earned the money required, as a gover- 
ness in a family of wealthy friends. Then she aided the 
sister ; and, as the result, one of them is married happily 
to a man of great wealth, and the other is receiving a large 
income as a popular musical artist. 

Another young girl, educated as a ' fine musician by her 
wealthy parents, at the age of sixteen was afflicted with 
weak eyes and a heart complaint. She strove to solace her- 
self by benevolent ministries. By teaching music to chil- 
dren of wealthy friends she earned the means to relieve and 
instruct the suflfering, ignorant, and poor. 

These examples may suffice to show that, even among the 
most wealthy, abundant modes of self-denying benevolence 
may be found where there is a heart to seek them. 

There is no direction in which a true Christian economy 
of time and money is more conspicuous than in the style 
of living adopted in the family state. 

Those who build stately niansions, and lay out extensive 
grounds, and multiply the elegancies of life, to be enjoyed 
by themselves and a select few, " have their reward" in the 
enjoyments that end in this life. But those who with 
equal means adopt a style that enables them largely to devote 
time and wealth to the elevation and improvement of their 
fellow-men, are laying up never-failing treasures in heaven.

HEALTH OF MIOT). 

Theee 18 Buch an intimate connection between the bodj 
and mind tliat the health of one can not be preserved with- 
out a proper care of the other. And it is from a neglect of 
this principle, that some of the most exemplary and con- 
scientious persons in the world suffer a thousand mental 
agonies from a diseased state of body, whUe others ruin the 
health of the body by neglecting the proper care of the 
mind. 

When the mind is excited by earnest iatellectual effort, or 
by strong passions, the blood rushes to the head and the 
brain is excited. Sir Astley Cooper records that, in exam- 
ining the brain of a young man who had lost a portion of 
his skull, wheneyer " he was agitated by some opposition 
to his wishes," " the blood was sent with increased force to 
his brain," and the pulsations " became frequent and vio- 
lent." The same effect was produced by any intellectual ef- 
fort ; and the flushed countenance which attends earnest 
study or strong emotions of interest of any kind, is an ex- 
ternal indication of the suffused state of the brain from 
such causes. 

In exhibiting the causes which injure the health of the 
mind, we shall find them to be partly physical, partly intel- 
lectual, and partly moral. 

The first cause of mental disease and suffering is not im- 
frequently in the want of a proper supply of duly oxygen- 
ized blood. It has been shown that the blood, in passing 
through the lungs, is purified by the oxygen of tlie air com- 



256 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

bining with the superabundant hydrogen and carbon of the 
venous blood, thus forming carbonic acid and water, which 
are expired into the atmosphere. Every pair of lungs is 
constantly withdrawing from the surrounding atmosphere 
its heathful principle, and returning one which is injurious 
to human life. 

When, by confinement and this process, the air is depriv- 
ed of its appropriate supply of oxygen, the purification of the 
blood is interrupted, and it passes without being properly 
prepared into the brain, producing languor, restlessness, and 
inability to exercise the intellect and feelings. "Whenever, 
therefore, persons sleep in a close apartment, or remain for 
a length of time in a crowded or ill-ventilated room, a most 
pernicious influence is exerted on the brain, and, through 
this, on the mind. A person who is often exposed to such 
influences can never enjoy that elasticity and vigor of mind 
which is one of the chief indications of its health. This is 
the reason why all rooms for religious meetings, and all 
school-rooms and sleeping apartments should be so contrived 
as to secure a constant supply of fresh air from without. 
The minister who preaches in a crowded and ill-ventilated 
apartment loses much of his power to feel and to speak, 
while the audience are equally reduced in their capability of 
attending. The teacher who confines children in a close 
apartment diminishes their ability to study, or to attend to 
instructions. And the person who habitually sleeps in a* 
close room impairs mental energy in a similar degree. It is 
not unfrequently the case that depression of spirits and 
stupor of intellect are occasioned solely by inattention to 
this subject. 

Another cause of mental disease is the excessive exer- 
cise of the intellect or feelings. If the eye is taxed beyond 
its strength by protracted use, its blood-vessels become 
gorged, and the bloodshot appearance warns of the excess 
and the need of rest. The brain is affected in a similar 
manner by excessive use, though the suffering and inflamed 



HEALTH OF MIND. 257 

organ can not make its appeal to the eye. But there are 
some indications which ought never to be misunderstood 
or disregarded. In cases of pupils at school or at college, 
a diseased state, from over-action, is often manifested by 
increased clearness of mind, and temporary ease and vigor 
of mental action. In one instance, known to the writer, a 
most exemplary and industrious pupil, anxious to impi-ove 
every hour and ignorant or unmindful of the laws of 
health, first manifested the diseased state of her brain and 
mind by demands for more studies, and a sudden and earn- 
est activity in planning modes of improvement for herself 
and others. When warned of her danger, she protested 
that she never was better in her life; that she took re- 
gular exercise in the open air, went to bed in season, slept 
soundly, and felt perfectly well ; that her mind was never 
before so bright and clear, and study never so easy and 
delightful. And at this time, she was on the verge of 
derangement, from which she was saved only by an en- 
tire cessation of all intellectual efforts. 

A similar case occurred, under the eye of the writer, 
from over-excited feelings. It was during a time of un- 
usual religious interest in the community, and the mental 
disease was first manifested by the pupil bringing her 
hymn-book or Bible to the class-room, and making it her 
constant resort, in every interval of school duty. It finally 
bectoie impossible to convince her that it was her duty to 
attend to any thing else ; her conscience became morbidly 
sensitive, her perceptions indistinct, her deductions un- 
reasonable ; and nothing but entire change of scene and 
exercise, and occupation of her mind by amusement, saved 
her. When the health of the brain was restored, she 
found that she could attend to the " one thing needful," 
not only without interruption of duty or injury to health, 
but rather so as to promote both. Clergymen and teachers 
need most carefully to notice and guard agaiust the dan- 
gers here alluded to. 



258 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Ati j such attention to religion as prevents the perform- 
ance of daily duties and needful relaxation is dangerous, 
and tends to produce such a state of the brain as makes 
it impossible to feel or judge correctly. And when any 
morbid and unreasonable pertinacity appears, much exer- 
cise and engagement in other interesting pursuits should 
be urged, as the only mode of securing the religious bene- 
fits aimed at. And whenever any mind is oppressed with 
care, anxiety, or sorrow, the amount of active exercise in 
the fresh air should be greatly increased, that the action 
of the muscles may withdraw the blood which, in such 
seasons, is constantly tending too much to the brain. 

There has been a most appalling amount of suffering, 
derangement, disease, and death, occasioned by a want of 
attention to this subject, in teachers and parents. Un- 
common precocity in children is usually the result of an 
unhealthy state of the brain ; and in such cases medical 
men would now direct that the wonderful child should be 
deprived of all books and study, and turned to play out in 
the fresh air. Instead of this, parents frequently add fuel 
to the fever of the brain, by supplying constant mental 
stimulus, until the victim finds refuge in idiocy or an early 
grave. Where such fatal results do not occur, the brain 
in many cases is so weakened that the prodigy of infancy 
sinks below the medium of intellectual powers in after- 
life. 

In our colleges, too, many of the most promising minds 
sink to an early grave, or drag out a miserable existence, 
from this same cause. And it is an evil as yet little alle- 
viated by the increase of physiological knowledge. Every 
college and professional school, and every seminary for 
young ladies, needs a medical man or woman, not only to 
lecture on physiology and the laws of health, but empow- 
ered by official capacity to investigate the case of every 
pupil, and, by authority, to enforce such a course of 
study, exercise and repose, as the physical system, requires. 



HEALTH OF MIND. 259 

The writer has found by experience that in a large institu- 
tion there is one class of pupils who need to be restrained 
by penalties from late hours and excessive study, as mucli 
as another class need stimulus to industry. 

Under the head of excessive mental action, must be 
placed the iadulgence of the imagination in novel-reading 
and " castle-building." This kind of stimulus, unless coun- 
terbalanced by physical exercise, not only 'wastes time and 
energies, but undermines the vigor of the nervous system. 
The imagination was designed by our wise Creator as a 
charm and stimulus to animate to benevolent activity; 
and its perverted exercise seldom fails to bring a penalty. 

Another cause of mental disease is the want of the ap- 
propriate exercise of the various faculties of the mind. On 
this point. Dr. Combe remarks : " We have seen that, by 
disuse, muscles become emaciated, bone softens, blood-ves- 
sels are obliterated, and nerves lose their characteristic 
structure. The brain is no exception to this general rule. 
The tone of it is also impaired by permanent inactivity, 
and it becomes less fit to manifest the mental powers with 
readiness and energy." It is " the withdrawal of the 
stimulus necessary for its healthy exercise which renders 
solitary confinement so severe a punishment, even to the 
most daring minds. It is a lower degree of the same cause 
which renders continuous seclusion from society so inju- 
rious to both mental and bodily health." 

" Inactivity of intellect and of feeling is a very frequent 
predisposing cause of every form of nervous disease. For 
demonstrative evidence of this position, we have only to 
look at the numerous victims to be found among persons 
who have no call to exertion in gaining the means of sub- 
sistence, and no objects of interest on which to exercise 
their mental faculties, and who consequently sink into 
a state of mental sloth and nervous weakness." " If we 
look abroad upon society, we shall find innumerable exam- 
ples of mental and nervous debility from this cause. Wlien 



260 THE BOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

a person of some mental capacity is confined for a long 
time to an unvarying round of employment which affords 
neither scope nor stimulus for one half of the faculties, and, 
from want of education or society, has no external re- 
som'ces ; the mental powers, for want of exercise, become 
blmited, and the perceptions slow and dull." " The intel- 
lect and feelings, not being provided with interests external 
tq themselves, must either become inactive and weak, or 
work upon themselves and become diseased." 

" The most frequent victims of this kind of predisposi- 
tion are females of the middle and higher ranks, especially 
those of a nervous constitution and good natural abilities ; 
but who, from an ill-directed education, possess nothing 
more solid than mere accomplishments, and have no ma- 
terials for thought," and no " occupation to excite interest 
or demand attention." " The liability of such persons to 
melancholy, hysteria, hypochondriasis, and other varieties 
of mental distress, really depends on a state of irritability 
of the brain, induced by imperfect exercise." 

These remarks of a medical man illustrate the principles 
before indicated ; namely, that the demand of Christianity, 
that we live to promote the general happiness, and not 
merely for selfish indulgence, has for its aim not only the 
general good, but the highest happiness of the individual 
of whom it is required in offering abundant exercise for 
all the noblest faculties. 

A person possessed of wealth, who has nothing more 
noble to engage attention than seeking personal enjoy- 
ment, subjects the mental powers and moral feelings to a 
degree of inactivity utterly at war with health and mind. 
A.nd the greater the capacities, the greater are the suffer- 
ings which result from this cause. Any one who has read 
the misanthropic wailings of Lord Byron has seen the ne- 
cessary result of great and noble powers bereft of their ap- 
propriate exercise, and, in consequence, becoming sources 
of the keenest suffering. 



BE ALTS OF MIND. 261 

It is tLis view of the Bubject whicli has often awakened 
feelings of sorrow and anxiety in the mind of the writer, 
while aiding in the development and education of superior 
feminine minds, in the wealthier circles. Not because there 
are not noble objects for interest and effort, abundant, and 
within reach of such minds ; but because long-established 
custom has made it seem so quixotic to the majority, even 
of the professed followers of Christ, for a woman of wealth 
to practice any great self-denial, that few have independence 
of mind and Christian principle sufficient to overcome such 
an influence. The more a mind has its powers developed, 
the more does it aspire and pine after some object worthy 
of its energies and affections; and they are commonplace 
and phlegmatic characters who are most free from such 
deep-seated wants. Many a young woman, of fine genius 
and elevated sentiment, finds a charm in Lord Byron's 
writings, because they present a glowing picture of wh>at, 
to a certain extent, must be felt by every well-developed 
mind which has no nobler object in life than the pursuit 
of self-gratification. 

If young ladies of wealth could pursue their education 
imder the full conviction that the increase of their powers 
and advantages increased their obligations to use all for 
the good of society, and with some plan of benevolent en- 
terprise in view, what new motives of interest would be 
added to their daily pursuits ! And what blessed results 
would follow to our beloved country, if all well-educated 
women carried- out the principles of Christianity, in the 
exercise of their developed powers ! 

The benevolent activities called forth in our late dread- 
ful war illustrate the blessed influence on character and 
happiness in having a noble object for which to labor and 
suffer. In illustration of this, may be mentioned the ex- 
perience of one of the noble women who, in a sickly cli- 
mate and fervid season, devoted herself to the ministries 
of a military hospital. Separated from an adored bus-

band, deprived of wonted comforts and luxuries, and toil- 
ing in humble and unwonted labors, slie yet recalls this as 
one of the happiest periods of her life. And it was not the 
mere exercise of benevolence and piety in ministering 
comfort and relieving suffering. It was, still more, the ele- 
vated enjoyment which only an enlarged and cultivated 
miad can attain, in the inspirations of grand and far-reach- 
ing results purchased by such sacrifice and suffering. It 
was ia aiding to save her well-loved country fi-om impend- 
ing ruin, and to preserve to coming generations the bless- 
ings of true liberty and self-government, that toils and 
suffering became triumphant joys. 

Every Christian woman who " walks by faith and not by 
sight," who looks forward to the results of self-sacrificing 
labor for the ignorant and sinful as they will enlarge and 
expand through everlasting ages, may rise to the same ele- 
vated sphere of experience and happiness. 

On the contrary, the more highly cultivated the mind 
devoted to mere selfish enjoyment, the more are the sources 
of true happiness closed and the soul left to helpless empti- 
ness and unrest. 

The indications of a diseased mind, owing to the want 
of the proper exercise of its powers, are apathy, discon- 
tent, a restless longing for excitement, a craving for unat- 
tainable good, a diseased and morbid action of the imagi- , 
nation, dissatisfaction with the world, and factitious inter- 
est in trifies which the mind feels to be unworthy of its 
powers. Such minds sometimes seek alleviation in excit- 
ing amusements ; others resort to the grosser enjoyments 
of sense. Oppressed with the extremes of languor, or 
over-excitement, or apathy, the body fails under the wear- 
ing process, and adds new causes of suffering to the mind. 
Such, the compassionate Saviour calls to his servi3(!, in 
the appropriate terms, " Come unto me, all ye that labor 
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my 
yoke upon you, and learn of me," " and ye shall find rest 
unto your souls."

THE CAEE OF INFAUT8. 

The topic of this chapter may well be prefaced by an 
extract fi-om Herbert Spencer on the treatment of offspring. 
He first supposes that some future philosophic speculator, 
examining the course of education of the present period, 
should find nothing relating to the training of children, 
and that his natm-al inference would be that our 
schools were all for monastic orders, who have no charge 
of infancy and childhood. He then remarks, " Is it not an 
astonishing fact that, though on the treatment of offspring 
depend their lives or deaths and their moral welfare or 
ruin, yet not one word of instruction on the treatment of 
offspring is ever given to those who will hereafter be 
parents ? Is it not monstrous that the fate of a new gene- 
ration should be left to the chances of unreasoning custom, 
or impulse, or fancy, joined with the suggestions of igno- 
rant nurses and the prejudiced counsel of grandmothers ? 

" If a merchant should commence business without any 
knowledge of arithmetic or book-keeping, we should ex- 
claim at his folly and look for disastrous consequences. 
Or 'if, without studying anatomy, a man setup as a sur- 
geon, we should wonder at his audacity and pity his pa- 
tients. But that parents should commence the difficult 
work of rearing children without giving any attention to 
the principles, physical, moral, or intellectual, which ought 
to guide them, excites neither surprise at the actors nor 
pity for the victims." 

" To tens of thousands that are killed add hundreds oi 



264 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

thousands that surviye with feeble constitutions, and millions 
not so strong as they should be ; and you will have some idea 
of the curse inflicted on their offspring, ]»y parents ignorant 
of the laws of life. Do but consider for a moment that 
the regimen to which children are subject is hourly teUing 
upon them to their life-long injury or benefit, and that 
there are twenty ways of going wrong to one way of go- 
ing right, and you will get some idea of the enormous 
mischief that is almost everywhere inflicted by the thought- 
less, hap-ha^ard system in common use." 

" When sons and daughters grow up sickly and feeble, 
parents conmaonly regard the event as a visitation of 
Providence. They assume that these evils come without 
cause, or that the cause is supernatural. Nothing of the 
kind. In some cases causes are inherited, but in most 
cases foolish management is the cause. Yery generally 
parents themselves are rosponsible for this pain, this de- 
bility, this depression, this misery. They have under- 
taken to control the lives of their offspring, and with cruel 
carelessness have neglected to learn those vital processes 
which they are daily affecting by their commands and 
prohibitions. In utter ignorance of the simplest physiolo- 
gical laws, they have been, year by year, undermining the 
constitutions of their children, and so have inflicted dis- 
ease and premature death, not only on them but also on 
their descendants. 

" Equally great are the ignorance and consequent injury, 
when we turn from the physical to the moral training. 
Consider the yoimg, untaught mother and her nm-sery le- 
gislation. A short time ago she was at school, where her 
memory was crammed with words and names and dates, 
and her reflective faculties scarcely in the slightest degree 
exercised — where not one idea was given her respecting 
the methods of dealing with the opening mind of child- 
hood, and where her discipline did not in the least fit her 
for thinking out methods of her own. The intervening 



TBE CARE OF INFANTS. 265 

years have been spent in practicing music, fancy work, 
novel-reading and party-going, no thought having been 
given to the grave responsibilities of maternity, and 
scarcely any of that solid intellectiial culture obtained 
which would fit her for such responsibilities ; and now see 
her with an unfolding human character committed to her 
charge, see her profoundly ignorant of the phenomena 
with which she has to deal, undertaking to do that which 
can be done but imperfectly even with the aid of the pro- 
foundest knowledge !" 

In view of such considerations, every young lady ought 
to learn how to take proper care of an infant ; for, even if 
she is never to become the responsible guardian of a 
nursery, she will often be in situations where she can ren- 
der benevolent aid to others, in this most fatiguing and 
anxious duty. 

The writer has known instances in which young ladies, 
who had been trained by their mothers properly to 
perform this duty, were in some cases the means of saving 
the lives of infants, and in others, of relieving sick moth- 
ers from intolerable care and anguish by their benevolent 
aid. 

On this point. Dr. Combe remarks, " AH women are 
not destined, in the course of nature, to become mothers ; 
but how very small is the number of those who are un- 
connected, by family ties, friendship, or sympathy, with the 
children of others ! How very few are there, who, at some 
time or other of their lives, would not find their useful- 
ness and happiness increased, by the possession of a kind 
of knowledge intimately allied to their best feelings and 
affections ! And how important is it, to the mother her- 
self, that her efforts should be seconded by intelligent, in- 
stead of ignorant assistants !" 

In order to be prepared for such benevolent ministries, 
every young lady should improve the opportunity, when- 
ever it is afforded her, for learning how to wash, dress,

and teiid a young infant ; and whenever she meets with 
such a work as Dr. Combe's,, on the management of in- 
fants,^ she ought to read it, and remember its contents. 

It was the design of the author to fill this chapter 
chiefly with extracts from various medical writers, giving 
some of the most important directions on this subject; 
but finding these extracts too prolix for a work of this 
kind, she has condensed them into a shorter compass. Some 
are quoted verbatim, and some are abridged, from the 
most approved writers on this subject. 

" IsTearly one half of the deaths, occurring during the 
first two years of existence, are ascribable to mismanage- 
ment, and to errors in diet. At birth, the stomach is fee- 
ble, and as yet unaccustomed to food; its cravings are 
consequently easily satisfied, and frequently renewed." 
"At that early age, there ought to be no fixed time for 
giving nourishment. The stomach can not be thus satis- 
fied." " The active call of the infant is a sign, which 
needs never be mistaken." 

" But care must be taken to determine between the crying 
of pain or uneasiness, and the call for food ; and the practice 
of giving an infant food, to stop its cries, is often the means 
of increasing its sufierings. After a child has satisfied its 
hunger, from two to four hours should intervene before 
another supply is given." 

" At birth, the stomach and bowels, never having been 
used, contain a quantity of mucous secretion, which re- 
quires to be removed. To effect this, Ifature has rendered 
the first portions of theonother's milk purposely watery and 
laxative. Nurses, however, distrusting Nature, often has- 
ten to administer some active purgative; and the conse- 
quence often is, irritation in the stomach and bowels, not 
easily subdued." It is only where the child is deprived of its 
mother's milk, as the first food, that some gentle laxative 
should be given. 

" It is a common mistake, to suppose that because a wo- 



TSE CARE OF INFANTS. 261 

man is nursing, slie ought to live very Mly, and to add an 
allowance of wine, porter, or other fermented liquor, to her 
usual diet. The only result of this plan is, to cause an 
unnatural fullness in the system, which places the nurse on 
the brink of disease, and retards rather than increases the 
food of the infant. More will be gained by the observance 
of the ordinary laws of health, than by any foolish devia- 
tion, founded on ignorance." 

There is no point on which medical men so emphatically 
lift the voice of warning as in reference to administering 
medicines to infants. It is so difficult to discover what is the 
matter with an infant, its frame is so delicate and so sus- 
ceptible, and slight causes have such a powerful influence, 
that it requires the utmost skill and judgment to ascertain 
what would be proper medicines, and the proper quantity 
to be given. 

Says Dr. Combe, " That there are cases in which active 
means must be promptly used to save the child, is perfectly 
true. But it is not less certain that these are cases of 
which no mother or nurse ought to attempt the treatment. 
As a general rule, where the child is well managed, medi- 
cine, of any kind, is very rarely required ; and if disease 
were more generally regarded in its true light, not as some- 
thing thrust into the system, which requires to be expelled 
by force, but as an aberration from a natural mode of action, 
produced by some external cause, we should be in less 
haste to attack it by medicine, and more watchful in its 
prevention. Accordingly, where a constant demand for 
medicine exists in a nursery, the mother may rest assured 
that there is something essentially wrong in the treatment 
of her children." 

" Much havoc is made among infants, by the abuse of 
calomel and other medicines, which procure momentary 
relief but end by producing incurable disease ; and it has 
often excited my astonishment, to see how recklessly reme- 
dies of this kind are had recourse to, on thel most trifling 



268 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

occasions, by mothers and nurses, wtio would be horrified 
if they knew the nature of the power they are wielding, 
and the extent of injury they are inflicting." 

Instead, then, of depending on medicine for the preserva- 
tion of the health and life of an infant, the following pre- 
cautions and preventives should be adopted. 

" Take particular care of the food of an infant. If it is 
nourished by the mother, her own diet should be simple, 
nourishing, and teniperate. If the child be brought up 
' by hand,' the milk of a new-milch cow, mixed with one 
third water, and sweetened a little with white sugar, should 
be the only food given, until the teeth come. This is more 
suitable than any preparations of flour or arrowroot, the 
nourishment of which is too highly concentrated. Never 
give a child bread, cake, ,or meat, before the teeth appear. 
If the food appear to distress the child after eating, first 
ascertain if the milk be really from a new-milch cow, as it 
may otherwise be too old. Learn, also, whether the cow 
lives on proper food. Cows that are fed on still-slops, as is 
often the case in cities, furnish milk which is very un- 
healthful." 

Be sure and keep a good supply of pure and fresh air in 
the nursery. On this point. Dr. Bell remarks, respecting 
rooms constructed without fireplaces and without doors or 
windows to let in pure air from without, " The sufferings 
of children of feeble constitutions are increased beyond 
measure, by such lodgings as these. An action, brought 
by the commonwealth, ought to lie against those persons 
who build houses for sale or ren,t, in which rooms are so 
constructed as not tp allow of free ventilation ; and a writ 
of lunacy taken out against those who, with the common- 
sense experience which all have on this head, should spend 
any portion of their time, still more, should sleep, in rooms 
thus nearly air-tight." 

After it is a month or two old, take an infant out to 
walk, or ride, in a little wagon, every fair and warm day ; 



T^E CAME OF INFANTS. 269 

but be very careful that its feet, and every part of its body, 
are kept warm ; and be sure that its eyes are well protected 
from the light. "Weak eyes, and sometimes blindness, 'are 
caused by neglecting this precaution. ' Keep the head of an 
infant cool, never allowing too warm bonnets, nor permit- 
ting it to sink into soft pillows when asleep. Keeping an 
infant's head too warm very much increases nervous irrita- 
bility ; and this is the reason why medical men forbid the 
use of caps for infants. But the head of an infant should, 
especially while sleeping, be protected from draughts of air, 
and from getting cold. 

Be very carefal of the skin of an infant, as nothing tends 
so effectually to prevent disease. For this end, it should 
be washed all over every naoming, and then gentle friction 
should be applied with the hand, to the back, stomach, 
bowels, and limbs. The head should be thoroughly washed 
every day, and then brushed with a soft hair-brush, or 
combed with a fine comb. If, by neglect, dirt accumulates 
under the hair, apply with the finger the yolk of an egg, 
and then the fine comb will remove it all, without any 
trouble. 

Dress the infant so that it will be always warm, but not 
so as to cause perspiration. Be sure and keep its feet 
always warm; and for this often warm them at a fire, 
and use long dresses. Keep the neck and arms covered. 
For this purpose, wrappers, open in front, made high in the 
neck, with long sleeves, to put on over the frock, are now 
very fashionable. 

It is better for both mother and child, that it should not 
sleep on the mother's arm at night, unless the weather be 
extremely ^cold. This practice keeps the child too waVm, 
and leads it to seek food too frequently. A child should 
ordinarily take nourishment but twice in the night. A 
crib beside the mother, with plenty of warm and light 
covering, is best for the child ; but the mother must be sure 
that it is always kept warm. 



270 TEE HOUSEKEEPER-S MANUAL. 

Never eoTer a child's head, so that it will inhale the air 
of its own lungs. In very warm weather, especially in cities, 
gi'eat pains shoiild be taken to find fresh and cool air by 
rides and sailing. "Walks in a public square in the cool of 
the morning, and frequent excursions in ferry or steam- 
boats, would often save a long bill for medical attendance. 
In hot nights, the windows should be kept open, and the 
infant laid on a mattress, or on folded blankets. A bit of 
straw matting, laid over a feather bed and covered with the 
under sheet, makes a very cool bed for an infant. 

Cool bathing, in hot weather, is very useful; but tie 
water should be very little cooler than the skin of the child. 
Wlien the constitution is delicate, the water should be 
slightly warmed. Simply sponging the body freely in a 
tub, answers the same purpose as a regular bath. In ver^ 
warm weather, this should be done two or three times a day, 
always waiting two or three hours after food has been given. 

" When the stomach is peculiarily irritable, (from teeth- 
ing,) it is of paramount necessity to withhold all "the nos- 
trums which have been so falsly lauded as ' sovereign cures 
for cholera infantum^ The true restoratives for a child 
threatened with disease are cool air, cool bathing, and cool 
drinks of simple water, in addition to ^>qper food, at stated 
intervals." 

In many cases, change of air from sea to mountain, 
or the reverse, has an immediate healthful influence and is 
superior to every other treatment. Do not take the advice 
of mothers who tell of this, that, and the other thing, 
which liave proved excellent remedies in their experience. 
Children have different constitutions, and there are multi- 
tudes of different causes for their sickness ; and what might 
cure one child, might kill another, which appeared to have 
the same complaint. > A mother should go on the general 
rule of giving an infant very little niedicine, and then only 
by the direction of a discreet and experienced physician. 
And there are cases, when, according to the views of the 



THE CABE OF INFANTS. 271 

most distingmshed and competent practitioners, physicians 
themselves are much too free in using medicines, instead 
of adopting preventive measures. 

Do not allow a child to form such habits that it will 
not be quiet unless tended and amused. A healthy child 
should be accustomed to lie or sit in its cradle much of the 
time ; but it should occasionally be taken up and tossed, 
or carried about for exercise and amusement. An infant 
should be encouraged to creep, as an exercise very strength- 
ening and useful. If the mother fears the soiling of its 
nice dresses, she can keep a long slip or apron which will 
entirely cover the dress, and can be removed when the 
child is taken in the arms. A child should not be allowed, 
when quite young, to bear its weight on its feet very long 
at a time, .is this tends to weaken and distort the limbs. 

Many mothers, with a little painstaking, succeed in put- 
ting their infants into their cradle while awake, at regular 
hours for sleep ; and induce regularity in other habits, 
which saves much trouble. During this training process a 
child may cry, at first, a great deal ; but for a healthy child, 
this iise of the lungs does no harm and tends rather to 
strengthen than to injure them, unless it becomes exceed- 
ingly violent. A child whq is trained to lie or sit and 
amuse itself, is happier than one who is carried and tended 
a great deal, and thus rendered restless and uneasy when 
not so indulged. 

The most critical period in the life of an infant is that 
of dentition or teething, especially at the early stages. An 
adult has thirty-two teeth, but young children have only 
twenty^ which gradually loosen and are followed by the 
permanent teeth. When the child has ten teeth on each 
jaw, all that are added are the permanent set, which should 
be carefully preserved ; this caution ie needful, as sometimes 
decay in the first double teeth of the second set are sup- 
posed to be of the transient set, and are so neglected, 
or are removed instead of being preserved by plug- 



272 THE BOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

ging. When tlie first teeth rise so as to press against 
the gums, there is always more or less inflammation, caus- 
ing nervous fretfulness, and the impulse to put every thing 
into the mouth. Usually there is disturbed sleep, a slight 
fever, and greater flow of saliva ; this is often relieved by 
letting the child have ice to bite, tied in a rag. 

Sometimes the disorder of the mouth extends to the whole 
system. In difficult teething, one symptom is the jerking 
back of the head when taking the breath, as if in pain, owing 
to the extreme soreness of the gums. This is, in extreme 
cases, attended with increased saliva and a giunmy secretion in 
the corners of the eyes, itching of the nose, redness of cheeks, 
rash, convulsive twitching of lips and the muscles generally, 
fever, constipation, and sometimes by a diarrhea, which 
last is favorable if slight ; difficulty of breathing, dilation 
of the pupils of the eyes, restless motion and moaning ; and 
finally, if not relieved, convulsions and death. The most 
effective relief is gained by lancing the gimis. Every wo- 
man, and esjDecially every mother, should know the time 
and order in which the infant teeth come, and, when any of 
the above symptoms appear, should examine the mouth, 
and if a gum is swollen and inflamed, should either have a 
physician lance it, or if this can not be done, should per- 
form the operation herself. A sharp pen-knife and steady 
hand making incision to touch the rising tooth will cause 
no more pain than a simple scratch of the gum, and usu- 
ally will give speedy relief. 

The temporary teeth should not be removed until the 
new ones appear, as it injures the jaw and coming teeth ; 
but as soon as a new tooth is seen pressing upward, the tem- 
porary tooth should be removed, or the new tooth will 
come out of its proper place. If there is not room where 
the new tooth appears, the next temporary tooth must be 
taken out. Great mischief has been done by removing the 
first teeth before the second appear, thus making a con- 
traction of the jaw. 



THE CARE OF INFANTS. 2l3 

Most trouble with the teeth of young children comes 
from neglect to use the bmsh to remove the tartar that ac- 
cumulates near the gum, causing disease and decay. This 
disease is sometimes called scurvy, and is shown by an accu- 
mulation around the teeth and by inflamed gums that 
bleed easily. Hemoval of the tartar by a dentist and clean- 
ing the teeth after every meal with a brush will usually cure 
this evil, which causes loosening of the teeth and a bad 
breath. 

Much injury is often done to teeth by using improi)or 
tooth-powder. Powdered chalk sifted through muslin is 
approved by all dentists, and should be used once every 
day. The tooth-brush should be used after every meal, and 
floss sUk pressed between the teeth to remove food lodged 
there. This method will usually save the teeth from de- 
cay till old age. 

When an infant seems ill during the period of dentition, 
the following directions from an experienced physician 
may be of service. It is now an accepted principle of all 
the medical world that fevers are to be reduced by cold 
applications ; but afl infant demands careful and judicious 
treatment in this direction ; some have extremely sensitive 
nerves, and cold is painful. For such, tepid sponging 
should be used near a fire, and the coldness increased grad- 
ually. The sensations of the child should be the guide. 
Usually, but not always, children that are healthy will 
learn by degrees to prefer cold water, and then it may safe- 
ly be used. 

When an infant becomes feverish, wrapping its body in 
a towel wrung out in warm or tepid water, and then keep- 
ing it warm in a woolen blanket, is a very safe and sooth- 
ing remedy. 

In case of constipation this preparation of food is useful : 

One table-spoonful of unbolted flour wet with cold water. 
Add one pint of hot water, and boil twenty minutes. Add 
when taken up, one pint of , milk. If the stomach seema 



274 TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

delicate and irritable, strain out the bran, but in most cases 
retain it. 

In case of diarrbea, walk -with the cbild in arms ,a great 
deal in tbe open air, and give it rice-water to drink. 

The warmth and vital influences of the nurse are very 
important, and make this mode of exercise both more 
soothing and more efficacious, especially in the open air, 
the infant being warmly clad. 

In case of feverishness from teething or from any other 
cause, wrap the infant in a towel wrung out in tepid wa- 
ter and then wrap it in a woolen blanket. The water may 
be cooler according as the child is older and stronger. 
The evaporation of the water di'aws off. the heat, while 
the moisture soothes the nerves, and usually the child will 
fall into a quiet sleep. As soon as it becomes restless, 
change the wet towel and proceed as before. 

The leading physicians of Europe and of this country, 
in all cases of fevers, use water to reduce them, by this 
and other modes of application. This method is more 
soothing than any other, and is as effective for adults as 
for infants. 

Some of the most distinguished physicians of New- 
Tork who have examined this chapter give their full ap- 
proval of the advice given. If there is still distrust as to 
this mode of using water to reduce fevers, it will be ad-» 
vantageous to read an address on the use of cold applica- 
tions in fevers, delivered by Dr. William Neftel, before 
the I^Tew-York Academy of Medicine, published in the 
I^ew- York Medical Record for November, 1868 : this 
can be obtained by inclosing twenty cents to the editor, 
with the post-office address of the applicant. 



XXII. 

THE MANAGEMENT OF TOtTNG CHILDEEN. 

Im" regard to the physical education of children, Dr, 
Clarke, Physician in Ordinary to the Queen of England, 
expresses views on one point, in which most physicians 
would coincide. He says, " There is no greater error in the 
management of children, than that of giving them animal 
diet very early. By persevering in the use of an over-stimula- 
ting diet the digestive organs become irritated, and the vari- 
ous secretions immediately connected with digestion, and 
necessary to it, are diminished, especially the hiliary secre- 
tion. Children so fed become very liable to attacks of 
fever, and inflammation, affecting particularly the mucous 
membranes; and measles and other diseases incident to 
childhood, are generally severe in their attacks." 

The result of the treatment of the inmates of the Orphan 
Asylum, at Albany, is one which all who have the care of 
young childi-en should deeply ponder. During the first six 
years of the existence of this institution, its average number 
of children was eighty. For the first three years, their diet 
was meat once a day, fine bread, rice, Indian puddings, 
vegetables, fruit, and milk. Considerable attention was 
given to clothing, fresh air, and exercise ; and they were 
bathed once in three weeks. During these three years, from 
four to six childrenj and sometimes more, were continually 
on the sick-list ; one or two assistant nurses were necessary ; 
a physician was called two or three times a week ; and, in 
this time, there were between thirty and forty deaths. At 
the end of this period, the management was changed, in 



276 TBE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

these respects : daily ablutions of the whole body were 
practiced ; bread of unbolted flour was substituted for that 
of fine wheat ; and all animal food was banished. More 
attention also was paid to clothing, bedding, fresh air, and 
exercise. 

The result was, that the nursery was vacated; the 
nurse and physician were no longer needed ; and, for 
two years, not a single case of sickness or death occurred. 
The tliird year also, there were no deaths, except those of 
two idiots and one other child, all of whom were new in- 
mates, who had not been subjected to this treatment. The 
teachers of the children also testified there was a manifest 
increase of intellectual vigor and activity, while there was 
much less irritability of temper. 

Let parents, nurses, and teachers reflect on the above 
statement, and bear in mind that stupidity of intellect, and 
irritability of temper, as well as ill-health, are often caused 
by the mismanagement of the nursery in regard to the 
physical training of children. 

There is probably no practice more deleterious, than 
that of allowing children to eat at short intervals, through 
the day. As the stomach is thus kept constantly at work, 
with no time for repose, its functions are deranged, and a 
weak or disordered stomach is the jBrequent result. Chil- 
dren should be required to keep cakes, nuts, and other 
good things, which should be sparingly given, till just be- 
fore a meal, and then they will form a part of their regular 
supply. This is better than to wait till after their hunger 
is satisfied by food, when they will eat the niceties merely 
to gratify the palate, and thus overload the stomach and 
interi'upt digestion. 

In regard to the intellectual training of young childreu, 
some modification in the common practice is necessary, 
with reference to their physical well-being. More care is 
needful, in providing well-ventilated school-rooms, and in 
securing more time for sports in the open air, during school 



TSE MANAGEMENT OF YOUNG CBILDREN. 211 

hours. It is very importaiit to most mothers that their 
young children should be removed from their care during 
certain school hours ; and it is very useful for quite young 
childi'en, to be subjected to the discipline of a school, and 
to intercourse with other children of their own age. And, 
with a suitable teacher, it is no matter how early children 
are sent to school, provided their health is not endangered by 
impure air, too much confinement, and too great mental 
stimulus, which is the chief danger of the present age. 

In regard to the formation of the moral character, it has 
been too much the case that the discipline of the nursery 
has consisted of disconnected efforts to make children either 
do, or refrain fi'om doing, certain particular acts. Do this, 
and be rewarded ; do that, and be punished ; is the ordi- 
naiy routine of family government. 

But children can be very early taught that their happy 
ness, both now and hereafter, depends on the formation of 
habits of submission, self-denial, and benevolence. And 
all the discipline of the nursery can be conducted by 
parents, not only with this general aim in their own minds, 
but also with the same object daily set before the minds of 
the children. Whenever their wishes are crossed, or their 
wills subdued, they can be taught that all this is done, not 
merely to please the parent, or to secure some good to 
themselves or to others ; but as a part of that merciful 
training which is designed to form such a character, and 
such habits, that they can hereafter find their chief happi- 
ness in giving up their will to God, and in living to do good 
to others, instead of living merely to please themselves. 

It can be pointed out to them, that they must always 
submit their will to the will of God, or else be continually 
miserable. It can be shown how, in the nursery, and in 
the 'school, and through all future days, a child must 
practice the giving up of his will and wishes, when they 
interfere with the rights and comfort of others ; and how 
important it is, early to learn to do this, so that it will, by 



278 THE EOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

habit, become easy and agreeable. It can be shown how 
children who are indulged in all their wishes, and who are 
never accustomed to any self-denial, always find it hard to 
refrain from what injures themselves and others. It can be 
shown, also, how important it is for every person to form 
such habits of benevolence toward others that self-denial 
in doing good will become easy. 

Parents have learned, by experience, that children can 
be constrained by authority and penalties to exercise self- 
denial, for their own good, till a habit is formed which 
makes the duty comparatively easy. For example, well 
trained children can be accustomed to deny themselves 
tempting articles of food, which are injurious, until the 
practice ceases to be painful and difficult. Whereas, an 
indulged child would be thrown into fits of anger or 
discontent, when its wishes were crossed by restraints of 
this kind. 

But it has not been so readily discerned, that the same 
method is needful in order to form a habit of self-denial in 
doing good to others. It has been supposed that while 
children must be forced, by authority, to be self-denying 
and prudent in regard to their own happiness, it may 
properly be left to their own discretion, whether they will 
practice any self-denial in doing good to others. But the 
more difficult a duty is, the greater is the need of parental 
authority in forming a habit which will make that duty easy. 

In order to secure this, some parents turn their earliest 
efforts to this object. They require the young child 
always to offer to others a part of every thing which it 
receives ; always to comply with all reasonable requests of 
others for service ; and often to practice little acts of self- 
denial, in order to secure some enjoyment for others. If 
one child receives a present of some nicety, he is required 
to share it with all his brothers and sisters. If one asks 
his brother to help him in some study or sport, and is met 
with a denial, the parent requires the unwilling child to act 



TBE MANAGEMENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN. 279 

benevolently, and give up some of his time to increase his 
brother's enjoyment. Of course, in such an effort as this, 
discretion must be used as to the frequency and extent of 
the exercise of authority, to induce a habit of benevolence. 
But where parents deliberately aim at such an object, and 
wisely conduct their instructions and discipline to secure 
it, very much will be accomplished. 

In regard to forming habits of obedience, there have 
been two extremes, both of which need to be shunned. 
One is, a stern and unsympathizing maintenance of parental 
authority, demanding perfect and constant obedience, 
without any attempt to convince a child of the j)ropriety 
and benevolence of the requisitions, and without any 
manifestation of sympathy and tenderness for the pain and 
difficulties which are to be met. Under such discipline, 
childi-en grow up to fear their parents, rather than to love 
and trust them ; while some of the most valuable principles 
of character are chilled, or forever blasted. 

In shunning this danger, other parents pass to the oppo- 
site extreme. They put themselves too much on the 
footing of equals with their childi-en, as if little were due to 
superiority of relation, age, and experience. Nothing is 
exacted, without the implied concession that the child is to 
be q, judge of the propriety of the requisition ; and reason 
and persuasion are employed, where simple coilamand and 
obedience would be far better. This system produces a 
most pernicious influence. Children soon perceive the 
position thus allowed them, and take every advantage of it. 
They soon learn to dispute parental requirements, acquire 
habits of forwardness and conceit, assume disrespectful 
manners and address, maintain their views with pertinacity, 
and yield to authority with ill-humor and resentment, as if 
their rights were infringed upon. 

The medium course is for the parent to take the attitude 
of a superior in age, knowledge, and relation, who has a 
perfect right to control every action of the child, and that, 



280 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

too, without giving any reason for the requisitions. " Obey 
hecause your parent commands,^^ is always a proper and suffi- 
cient reason : though not always the best to give. 

But care should be taken to coiivince the child that the 
parent is conducting a course of discipline, designed to 
make him happy ; and in forming habits of implicit obedi- 
ence, self-denial, and benevolence, the child should have the 
reasons for most requisitions kindly stated ; never, however, 
on the demand of it from the child, as a right, but as an act 
of kindness from the parent. 

It is impossible to govern children properly, especially 
those of strong and sensitive feelings, without a constant 
effort to appreciate the value which they attach to their 
enjoyments and pursuits. A lady of great strength of mind 
and sensibility once told the writer that one of the most 
acute periods of suffering in her whole life was occasioned 
by the burning up of some milkweed-silk, by her mother. 
The child had found, for the first time, some of this shining 
and beautiful substance ; was filled with delight' at her 
discovery ; was arranging it in parcels ; planning its future 
use, and her pleasure in showing it to her companions — 
when her mother, finding it strewed over the carpet, hastily 
swept it into the fire, and that, too, with so indifferent "an 
air, that the child fled away, almost distracted with grief 
and disappointment. The mother little realized the pain 
she had inflicted, but the child felt the unkindness so se- 
verely that for several days her mother was an object 
almost of aversion. While, therefore, the parent needs 
to carry on a steady course, which will oblige the child al- 
ways to give up its will, whenever its own good or the 
greater claims of others require it, this should be constantly 
connected with the expression of a tender sympathy for 
the trials and disappointments thus inflicted. 

Those, again, who will join with children and help them 
in their sports, will learn by this mode to understand the 
feelings and interests of childhood ; while at the same time, 



TSE WAN.A6EMENT OF TOUNQ CHILDREN. 281 

they secure a degree of confidence and affection whicli can 
not be gained so easily in any other way. And it is to be 
regretted that parents so often relinquish this most power- 
ful mode of influence to domestics and playmates, who often 
use it in the most pernicious manner. In joining in such 
sports, older persons should never yield entirely the attitude 
of superiors, or allow disrespectful manners or address. 
A.nd respectful deportment is never more cheerfully ac- 
corded, than in seasons when young hearts are pleased and 
made grateful by having their tastes and enjoyments so ef- 
ficiently promoted. 

IV'^xt to the want of all government, the two most fruit- 
ful sources of evil to children are, imsteadmess in govern- 
ment and over-government. Most of the cases in which the 
children of sensible and conscientious parents turn out 
badly, result fi'om one or the other of these causes. In 
cases of unsteady government, either one parent is very 
strict, severe and, unbending, and the other excessively in- 
dulgent, or else the parents are sometimes very strict and 
decided, and at other times allow disobedience to go un- 
punished. In such cases, childi-en, never knowing exactly 
when they can escape with impunity, are constantly tempted 
to make the trial. 

The bad effects of this can be better appreciated by ref- 
erence to one important principle of the mind. It is found 
to be universally true, that, when any object of desire is 
put entirely beyond the reach of hope or expectation, the 
mind very soon ceases to long for it, and turns to other ob- 
jects of pursuit. But so long as the mind is hoping for 
some good, and making efforts to obtain it, any opposition ex- 
cites irritable feelings. Let the object be put entirely beyond 
all hope, and this irritation soon ceases. 

In consequence of this principle, those children who are un- 
der the care of persons of steady and decided government 
know that whenever a thing is forbidden or denied, it is out 
of the reach of hope ; the desire, therefore, soon ceases, and 



282 THE BOUSEKEEPEWS MANUAL. 

they turn to other objects. But the children of undecided, or 
of over-indulgent parents, never enjoy this preserving aid, 
When a thing is denied, they never know but either coaxing 
may win it, or disobedience secure it without any penalty, 
and so they are kept in that state of hope and anxiety which 
produces irritation and tempts to insubordination.. The chil- 
dren o± very indulgent parents, and of those who are un- 
decided and unsteady in government, are very apt to be- 
come fretful, irritable, and fractious. 

Another class of persons, in shunning this evil, go to the 
other extreme, and are very strict and pertinacious in re- 
gard to every requisition. With them, fault-finding and 
penalties abound, until the children are either hardened 
into indifference of feeling, and obtuseness of conscience, 
or else become excessively irritable or misanthropic. 

It demands great wisdom, patience, and self-control, to 
escape these two extremes. In aiming at this, there are 
parents who have found the following maxims of very great 
value : 

First : Avoid, as much as possible, the multiplication of 
rules and absolute commands. Instead of this, take the 
attitude of advisers. " My child, this is improper, I wish 
you would remember not to do it." This mode of address 
answers for all the little acts of heedlessness, awkwardness, 
or ill-manners so frequently occurring with children. There 
are cases, when direct and distinct commands are needful ; 
and in such cases, a penalty for disobedience should be as 
steady and sure as the laws of nature. Where such stead- 
iness and certainty of penalty attend disobedience, children 
no more think of disobeying than they do of putting their 
fingers into a burning candle. 

The next maxim is, Govern by rewards more than by 
penalties. Such faults as willful disobedience, lying, dis- 
honesty, and indecent or profane language, should be pun- 
ished with severe penalties, after a child has been fully in- 
structed in the evil of such practices. But all the constant 



THh MANAOEMMNT OF T0UN6 CHILDREN. 283 

ly recurring faults of the nursery, such as ill-humor, quar- 
reling, carelessness, and ill-manners, may, in a great many 
cases, be regulated by gentle and kind remonstrances, and 
by the offt^ of some reward for persevering efforts to form 
a good habit. It is very injurious and degrading to any 
mind to be kept under the constant fear of penalties. Love 
and hope are the principles that should be mainly relied on, 
in forming the habits of childhood. 

Another maxim, and perhaps the most difficult, is, Do 
not govern by the aid of severe and angry tones. A single 
example- will be given to illustrate this maxim. A child is 
disposed to talk and amuse itself at table. The mother re- 
quests it to be silent, except when needing to ask for food, 
or when spoken to by its older friends. It constantly for- 
gets. The mother, instead of rebuking in an impatient 
tone, says, " My child, you must remember not to talk. I 
will remind you of it four times more, and after that, when- 
ever you forget, you must leave the table and wait till we 
are done." If the mother is steady in her, government, it is 
not probable that shd will have to apply this slight penalty 
more than once or twice. This method is far more effectual 
than the use of sharp and severe tones, to secure attention 
and recollection, and often answers the purpose as well as 
offering some reward. 

The writer has been in some famihes where the most ef- 
ficient and steady government has been sustained without 
the use of a cross or angry tone ; and in others, where a far 
less efficient discipline was kept up, by frequent severe re- 
bukes and angry remonstrances. In the first case, the chil- 
dren followed the example set them, and seldom used severe 
tones to each other ; in the latter, the method employed by 
the parents was imitated by the children, and cross words 
and angry tones resounded from morning till night, in every 
portion of the household. 

Another important maxim is, Try to keep children in a 
happy state of mind. Every one knows, by experience. 



284 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

that it is easier to do right and submit to rale when cheeiv 
f ul and happy, than when irritated. This is peculiarly true 
of children ; and a wise' mother, when she finds her child 
fretful and impatient, and thus constantly doing wrong, 
wUl often remedy the whole difficulty, by telling some 
amusing story, or by getting the child engaged in some 
amusing sport. This strongly shows the importance of 
learning to govern children without the employment of an- 
gry tones, which always produce irritation. 

Children of active, heedless temperament, or those who 
are odd, awkward, or unsuitable in their remarks and de- 
portment, are often essentially injured by a want of pa- 
tience and self-control in those who govern them. Such 
children often possess a morbid sensibility which they 
strive to conceal, or a desire of love and approbation, which 
preys like a famine on the soul. And yet, they become ob- 
jects of ridicule and rebuke to almost every member of the 
family, until their sensibilities are tortured into obtuseness 
or misanthropy. Such children, above all others, need 
tenderness and sympathy. A thousand instances of mis- 
take or forgetfulness should be passed ov6r in silenjoe, 
whUe opportunities for commendation and encouragement 
should be diligently sought. 

In regard to the formation of habits of self-denial in 
childhood, it iS astonishing to see how parents who are very 
sensible often seem to regard this matter. Instead of in- 
uring their children to this duty in early life, so that by 
habit it may be made easy in after-days, they seem to be 
studiously seeking to cut them off from every chance to se- 
cure such a preparation. Every wish of the child is studi- 
ously gratified ; and, where a 'necessity exists of crossing its 
wishes, some compensating pleasure is offered, in return. 
Such parents often maintain that nothing shall be put on 
their table, which their children may not join them in eat- 
ing. But where, so easily and surely as at the daily meal, 
can that habit of self-denial be formed, which is so needful 



TBE MANAGEMENT OF YOUNG CSILDBEN. 285 

m governing the appetites, and which children must ac- 
quire, or be ruined ? The food which is proper for grown 
persons, is often unsuitable for children ; and this is a suf- 
ficient reason for accustoming them to see others partake 
of delicacies, which they must not share. Eequiring chil- 
dren to wait till others are helped, and to refrain from con- 
versation at table, except when addressed by their elders, 
is another mode of forming habits of self-denial and self- 
control. Eequiring them to help others first, and to offer 
the best to others, has a similar influence. 

In forming the moral habits of children, it is wise to take 
into account the peculiar temptations to which they are to 
be exposed. The people of this nation are emiuently a 
trafficking people ; and the present standard of honesty, as 
to trade and debts, is very low, and every year seems sink- 
ing still lower. It is, therefore, preeminently important, 
that children should be trained to strict honesty, both in 
word and deed. It is not merely teaching children to avoid 
absolute lying, which is needed : all kinds of deceit should 
be guarded against ; and all kinds of little dishonest prac- 
tices be strenuously opposed. A child should be brought 
up with the determined principle, never to run in debt, but 
to be content to live in a humbler way, in order to se- 
cure that true independence, which should be the noblest 
distinction of an American citizen. 

There is no more important duty devolving upon a 
mother, than the cultivation of habits of modesty and pro- 
priety in young children. All indecorous words or deport- 
ment should be carefully restrained ; and delicacy and re- 
serve studiously cherished. It is a common notion, that it 
is important to secm-e these virtues to one sex, more than 
to the other ; and, by a strange inconsistency, the sex most 
exposed to danger is the one selected as least needing care. 
Yet a wise mother will be especially careful that her sons 
are trained to modesty and purity of mind. 

Yet few mothers are sufficiently aware of the dreadful 



286 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

penalties which often result from indulged impuritj of 
thought. If children, m future life, can be preserved from 
licentious associates, it is supposed that their safety is se- 
cured. But the records of our insane retreats, and the 
pages of medical writers, teach that even in solitude, and 
without being aware of the sin or the danger, children may 
inflict evils on themselves, which not unfrequently termi- 
nate in disease, delirium, and death. 

There is no necessity for explanations on this point any 
farther than this ; that certain parts of the body are not to 
be touched except for purposes of cleanliness, and that the 
most dreadful suffering comes from disobeying these com- 
mands. So in regard to practices and sins of which a young 
child will sometimes inquire, the wise parent will say, thai 
this is what children can not understand, and about which 
they must not talk or ask questions. And they should be 
told that it is always a bad sign, when children talk on 
matters which parents call vulgar and indecent, and thai 
the company of such children should be avoided. Disclos- 
ing details of wrong-doing to young and curious children^ 
often leads to the very evils feared. But parents and teach- 
ers, in this age of danger, should be well informed and 
watchful ; for it is not unfrequently the case, that servants 
and school-mates will teach young children practices, which 
exhaust the nervous system and bring on paralysis, mania, 
and death. 

And finally, in regard to the early religious training of 
children, the examples of the Creator in the early training 
of qur race may safely be imitated. That " He is, and is 
a rewarder" — that he is everywhere present — that he is a 
tender Father in heaven, who is grieved when any of his 
children do wrong, yet ever ready to forgive those who are 
striving to please him by well-doing, these are the most 
effective motives to save the young from the paths of dan- 
ger and sin. The rewards and penalties of the life to come 
are better adapted to maturer age, than to the imperfect 
and often false and fearful conceptions of the childish mind

DOMESTIC AHUSKMBNTS AOT) SOCIAL DtlTIES. 

Whenbvee the laws of body and mind are properly 
understood, it will be allowed that every person needs 
some kind of recreation ; and that, by seeking it, the body 
is strengthened, the mind is invigorated, and all onr duties 
are more cheerfully and successfully performed. 

Children, whose bodies are rapidly growing and whose 
nervous system is tender and excitable, need much more 
amusement than persons of mature age. Persons, also, who 
are oppressed with great responsibilities and duties, or who 
are taxed by great intellectual or moral excitement, need 
recreations which physically exercise and draw off the mind 
from absorbing interests. Unfortunately, such persons are 
those who least resort to amusements, while the idle, gay, 
and thoughtless seek those which are not needed, and for 
which useful occupation would be a most beneficial 
substitute. 

As the only legitimate object of amusement is to prepare 
mind and body for the proper discharge of duty, the pro- 
tracting of such as interfere with regular employments, or 
induce excessive fatigue, or weary the mind, or invade the 
proper hours for repose, must be sinful. 

In deciding what should be selected, and what avoided, 
the following are guiding principles. In the first place, no 
amusements which inflict needless pain should ever be 
allowed. All tricks which cause fright or vexation, and all 
sports which involve suffering to animals, should be utterly 
forbidden. Hunting and fishing, for mere sport, can never 



288 THE HOUSJEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

be justified. If a man can convince his children that ho 
follows these pursuits to gain food or health, and not for 
amusenient, his example may not be very injurious. But 
when children see grown persons kill and frighten animals, 
for sport, habits of cruelty, rather than feelings of tender- 
ness and benevolence, are cultivated. 

In the next place, we should seek no recreations which 
endanger life, or interfere with important duties. As the 
legitimate object of amusements is to promote health and 
])repare for some serious duties, selecting those which have a 
directly opposite tendency, can not be justified. Of "course, 
if a person feels that the previous day's diversion has 
shortened the hours of needful repose, or induced a lassitude 
of mind or body, instead of invigorating them, it is certain 
that an evil has been done which should never be repeated. 

Another rule which has been extensively adopted in the 
religious world is, to avoid those amusements which experi- 
ence has shown to be so exciting, and connected with so 
many temptations, as to be pernicious in tendency, both to 
the individual and to the community. It is on this groimd, 
that horse-racing and circus-riding have been excluded. 
Not because there is any thing positively wrong in having 
men and horses run and perform feats of agility, or in per- 
sons looking on for the diversion : but because experience 
has shown so many evils connected with these recreations, 
that they should be relinquished. So with theatres. The 
enacting of characters and the amusement thus afforded in 
themselves may be harmless ; and possibly, in certain 
cases, might be useful: but experience has shown so many 
evils to result from this source, that it has been deemed 
wrong to patronize it. So, also, with those exciting games 
of chance which are employed in gambling. 

Under the same head comes dancing, in the estimation of 
the great majority of the religious world. Still, there are 
many intelligent, excellent, and conscientious persons who 
hold a contrary opinion. Such maintain that it is an inno- 



DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS AND SOCIAL DUTIES. 289 

cent and healthful amusement, tending to promote ease of 
manners, cheerfulness, social affection, and health of mind 
and body ; that evils are involved only in its excess ; that like 
food, study, or religious excitement, it is only -wrong wheH 
not properly regulated; and that, if serious and intelli- 
gent people would strive to regulate, rather than banish, 
this amusement, much more good would be secm-ed. 

On the other side, it is objected, not that dancing is 
a sin, in itself considered, for it was once a part of saci'ed 
worship ; not that it would be objectionable, if it were 
properly regulated ; not that it does not tend, when used 
in a proper manner, to health of body and mind, to grace 
of manners, and to social enjoyment : all these things are 
conceded. Eut it is objected to, on the same ground as 
horse-racing and theatrical entertainments ; that we are to 
look at amusements as they are, and not as they might be. 
Horse-races might be so managed as not to involve cruelty, 
gambling, drunkenness, and other vices. And so might 
theatres. And if serious and intelligent persons undertook 
to patronize these, in order to regulate them, perhaps they 
would be somewhat raised from the depths to which they 
have sunk. But such persons believe that, with the weak 
sense of moral obligation existing in the mass of society, and 
the imperfect ideas mankind have of the proper use of amuse- 
ments, and the little self-control which men or women or 
children practice, these will not, in fact, be thus regulated. 

And they believe dancing to be liable to the same objec- 
tions. As this recreation is actually conducted, it does not 
tend to produce health of body or mind, but dii-ectly the 
contrary. If young and old went out to dance together 
in open air, as the French peasants do, it would be a very 
different sort of anusement from that which often is 
witnessed in a room furnished with many lights and filled 
with guests, both expending the healthful part of the 
atmosphere, where the young collect, in their tightest 
dresses, to protract for several hours a kind of physical ex- 



290 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

ertion whicli is not habitual to them. During this process, 
the blood is made to circulate more swiftly than usual, in 
circumstances where it is less perfectly oxygenized than 
health requires ; the pores of the skin are excited by heat 
and exercise ; the stomach is loaded with indigestible arti- 
cles, and the quiet, needful to digestion, withheld ; the di- 
version is protracted beyond the usual hour for repose ; and 
then, when the skin is made the most highly susceptible 
to damps and miasms, the company pass from a warm room 
to the cold night-air. It is probable that no single amuse- 
ment can be pointed out combining so many injurious 
particulars as this, which is so often defended as a health- 
ful one. Even if parepts, who train their children to dance, 
can keep them from public balls, (which is seldom the case,) 
dancing, as ordinarily conducted in private parlors, in most 
cases is subject to nearly all the same mischievous 
iafluences. 

The spirit of Christ is that of self-denying benevolence ; 
and his great aim, by his teachings and example, was to 
train his followers to avoid all that should lead to siq, es- 
pecially in regard to the weaker on^s of his family. Yet 
he made wine at a wedding, attended a social feast on the 
Sabbath,* reproved excess of strictness in Sabbath-keep- 
ing generally, and forbade no safe and innocent enjoyment. 
In following his example, the rulers of the family, then, wiU 
introduce the most highly exciting amusements only in cir- 
cumstances where there are such strong principles and hab- 
its of self-control that the enjoyment will not involve sin 
in the actor or needless temptation to the weak. 

The course pursued by om* Puritan ancestors, in the period 
succeeding their first perils amid sickness and savages, is an ex- 
ample that may safely be practiced at the present day. The 
young of both sexes were educated in the higher branches, 
in country academies, and very often the closing exercises

were theatricals, in whicli the pupils were performers and 
their pastors, elders, and parents, the audience. So, at so- 
cial gatherings, the dance was introduced before minister 
and wife, with smiling approval. The roaring fires and 
broad chimneys provided pure air, and the nine o'clock bell 
ended the festivities that gave new vigor and zest to life, 
while the dawn of the next day's light saw all at their posts 
of duty, with heartier strength and blither spirits. 

No indecent or unhealthful costumes offended the eye, 
no half -naked dancers of dubious morality were sustained 
in a life of dangerous excitement, by the money of Chris- 
tian people, for the mere amusement of their night hours. 
No shivering drivers were deprived of comfort and sleep, 
tp carry home the midnight followers of fashion ; nor was 
the quiet and comfort of servants in hundreds of dwellings 
invaded for the mere amusement of their superiors in educa- 
tion and advantages. The command "we that are strong, ought 
to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please our- 
selves," was in those days not reversed. Had the drama and 
the dance continued to be regulated by the rules of tempe- 
rance, health, and Christian benevolence, as in the days of 
our forefathers, they would not have been so generally 
banished from the religious world. And the question is 
now being discussed, whether they can be so regulated at 
the present time as not to violate the laws, either of health 
or benevolence.* 

In regard to home amusements, card-playing is now 
indulged in, in many conscientious families from which it 
formerly was excluded, and for these reasons : it is claimed 
that this is a quiet home amusement, which unites pleas- 

* Fanny Kemble Butler remarked to tlie present writer that she re- 
garded theatres wrong, chiefly because of the injury involved to the 
actors. Can a Christian mother contribute money to support young wo- 
men in a profession from which she would protect her own daughter, 
as from degradation, and that, too, simply for the amusement of herself 
and family ? Would this be following the self-sacrificing benevolence 
of Christ and his apostles ? 



292 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

antly the aged with the yoimg ; that it is not now employed 
in respectable society for gambling, as it formerly was; that 
to some young minds it is a peculiarly fascinating game, and 
should be first practiced under the parental care, till the ex 
citement of novelty is past, thus rendering the danger to 
children less, when going into the world ; and, finally, that 
habits of self-control in exciting circumstances may and 
should be thus cultivated in the safety of home. Many 
parents who have taken this com-se with their sons in early 
life, believe that it has proved rather a coui-se of safety 
than of danger. Still, as there is great diversity of opinion, 
among persons of equal worth and intelligence, a mutual 
spirit of candor and com'tesy should be practiced. The 
sneer at bigotry and narrowness of views, on one side, and' 
the uncharitable implication of want of piety, or sense, on 
the other, are equally ill-bred and unchristian. Truth on 
this subject is best promoted, not by ill-natured crimination 
and rebuke, but by calm reason, generous candor, forbear- 
ance, and kindness. 

There is another species of amusement, which a large 
portion of the religious world formerly put under the same 
condemnation as the preceding. Tliis is .novel-reading. 
The confusion and difference of opinion on this subject 
have arisen from a want of clear and definite distinctions. 
Now, as it is impossible to define what are novels and what 
are not, so as to include one class of fictitious writings and 
exclude every other, it is impossible to lay down any rule 
respecting them. The discussion, in fact, turns on the use 
of those works of imagination which belong to the class of 
fictitious narratives. That this species of reading is not 
only lawful but necessary and useful, is settled by divine 
examples, in the parables and allegories of Scripture. Of 
course, the question must be, what kind of fabulous writ- 
ings must be avoided, and what allowed. 

In deciding this, no specific rules can be given ; but it 
must be a matter to be regulated by the nature and circum- 



DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS AND SOCIAL DUTIES. 293 

stances of each case. No works of fiction which tend to 
throw the allurements of taste and genius around vice and 
crime should ever be tolerated ; and all that tend to give 
false views of life and duty should also be banished. Of 
those which are written for mere amusement, presenting 
scenes and events that are interesting and exciting and hav- 
ing no bad moral influence, much must depend on the char- 
acter and circumstances of the reader. Some minds are 
torpid and phlegmatic, and need to have the imagination 
stimulated : such would be benefited by this kind of 
reading. Others have quick and active imaginations, and 
would be as much injured by excess. Some persons are 
often so engaged in absorbing interests, that any thing in 
nocent, which will for a short time draw off the mind, is of 
the natm-e of a medicine ; and, in such cases, this kind of 
reading is useful. 

There is need, also, that some men should keep a super- 
vision of the current literature of the day, as guardians, to 
warn others of danger. Eor this purpose, it is more suitable 
for editors, clergymen, and teachers to read indiscrimi- 
nately, than for any other class of persons ; for they are the 
guardians of the public weal in matters of literature, and 
should be prepared to advise parents and young persons of 
the evils in one direction and the good in another. In do- 
ing this, however, they are bound to go on the same princi- 
ples which regulate physicians, when they visit infected dis- 
tricts — using every precaution to prevent injury to them- 
selves ; having as little to do with pernicious exposures, as 
a benevolent regard to others will allow; and faithfully 
employing all the knowledge and opportunities thus gained 
for warning and preserving others. There is much danger, 
in taking this course, that men will seek the excitement of 
the imagination for the mere pleasure it affords, under the 
plea of preparing to serve the public, when this is neither 
the aim nor the result. 

In regard^ to the use of such works by the young, as a 



294 THE EOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

general rule, they ought not to be allowed to any except 
those of a dull and phlegmatic temperament, until the solid 
parts of education are seciu'ed and a taste for more elevated 
reading is acquired. If these stimulating condiments in 
literature be freely used in youth, all relish for more solid 
reading will in a majority of cases be destroyed. If parents 
succeed in securing habits of cheerful and implicit obedi- 
ence, it will be vei'y easy to regulate this matter, by prohib- 
iting the reading of any story-book, until the consent of the 
parent is obtained. 

The most successful mode of forming a taste for suitable 
reading, is for parents to select interesting works of history 
and travels, with maps and pictm-es suited to the age and 
attainments of the young, and spend an hour or two each 
day or evening, in aiming to make truth as interesting as 
fiction. Whoever has once tried this method will find that 
the uninjured mind of childhood is better satisfied with 
what they know is true, when wisely presented, than with 
the most exciting novels, which they know are false. 

Perhaps there has been some just ground of objection to 
the com'se often pursued by parents in neglecting to pro- 
vide suitable and agreeable substitutes for the amusements 
denied. But there is a great abundance of safe, healthful, 
and delightful recreations, which all parents may secure for 
their childi-en. Some of these will here be pointed out. 

One of the most useful and important, is the cultivation 
of flowers and fruits. This, especially for the daughters 
of a family, is greatly promotive of health and amusement. 
It is with the hope that many young ladies, whose habits 
are now so formed that they can never be induced to a 
course of active domestic exercise so long as their parents 
are able to hire domestic service, may yet be led to an em- 
ployment which vsill tend to secure health and vigor of 
constitution, that much space will be given in the second 
volimie of this work, to directions for the cultivation of 
fruits and flowers. 



DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS AND SOCIAL DUTIES. 205 

It would be a most desirable improvement, if all schools 
for young wAmen could be furnished with suitable grounds 
and instruments for the cultivation of fruits and flowers, 
and every inducement offered to engage the pupils in this 
pursuit. Wo father, who wishes to have his daughters 
grow up to be healthful women, can take a surer method to 
seeui-e this end. Let him set apart a portion of his ground 
for fruits and flowers, and see that the soil is well prepared 
and dug over, and all the rest may be committed to the care 
of tlie children. These woiild need to be provided with a 
light hoe and rake, a dibble or garden trowel, a watering- 
pot, and means and opportunities for securing seeds, roots, 
bulbs, buds, and grafts, all which might be done at a trifling 
expense. Then, with proper encouragement and by the 
• aid of a few intelligible and practical directions, every 
man who has even half an acre could secure a small Eden 
around his premises. 

In pursuing this amusement children can also be led to 
acquire many useful habits. Early rising would, in many 
cases, be thus secured ; and if they were required to keep 
their walks and borders free fi'om weeds and rubbish, habits 
of order and neatness would be induced. Benevolent and 
social feelings could also be cultivated, by influencing 
children to share their fruits and flowers with friends and 
neighbors, as well as to distribute roots and seeds to those 
who have not the means of procuring them. A woman or 
a child, by giving seeds or slips or roots to a washerwoman, 
or a farmer's boy, thus inciting them to love and cultivate 
fruits and flowers, awakens a new and refining source of 
enjoyment in minds which have few resources more elevat- 
ed than mere physical enjoyments. Our Saviour directs 
us in making feasts, to call, not the rich who can recom- 
pense again, but the poor who can make no returns. So 
children shoxild be taught to dispense their little treasures 
not alone to companions and friends, who will probably 
return similar favors ; but to those who have no means of 



296 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

making any return. If the rich, who acquire a love for 
the enjoyments of taste and have the means to gratify it, 
would aim to extend among the poor the cheap and simple 
enjoyment of fruits and flowers, our country would soon 
literally " blossom as the rose." 

If the ladies of a neighborhood would unite small con- 
tributions, and send a list of flower-seeds and roots to some 
respectable and honest florist, who would not be likely to 
turn them off with trash, they could divide these among 
themselves and their poor neighbors, so as to secure an 
abundant variety at a very small expense. A bag of 
flower-seeds, which can be obtained at wholesale for four 
cents, would abundantly supply a whole neighborhood; 
and by the gatheiing of seeds in the autumn, could be 
perpetuated. 

Another very elevating and delightful recreation for the 
young is found in music. Here the writer would protest 
against the practice common in many families, of having 
the daughters learn to play on the piano whether they 
have a taste and an ear for music, or not. A young lady 
who does not sing well, and has no great fondness for music, 
does nothing but waste time, money, and patience in 
learning to play on the piano. But all children can be 
taught to sing in early childhood, if the scientific mode of 
teaching music in schools could be more widely intro- . 
duced, as it is in Prussia, Germany, and Switzerland. 
Then young childi-en could read and sing music as easily 
as they can read language ; and might take any tune, 
dividing themselves into bands, and sing off at sight the 
endless variety of music which is prepared^ And if 
parents of wealth would take pains to have teachers quali- 
fied for the purpose, who should teach all the yoimg chil- 
dren in the community, much would be done for the happi- 
ness and elevation of the rising generation. This is an 
element of education which we are glad to know is, year by 
year, more extensively and carefully cultivated ; and it is 



DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS AND SOCIAL DUTIES. 297 

not only a means of culture, but also an amusement, which 
children relish in the highest degree ; and wliich they can 
enjoy at home, in the fields, and ia visits abroad. 

Another domestic amusement is the collecting of shells, 
plants, and specunens in geology and mineralogy, for the 
formation of cabinets. If intelligent parents would pro- 
cure the simpler works which have been prepared for the 
young, and study them with their children, a taste for such 
recreations would soon be developed. The writer has seen 
young boys, of eight and ten years of age, gathering and 
cleaning shells from rivers, and / collecting plants and 
miaeralogical specimens, with a delight bordering on ecsta- 
sy ; and there are few, if any, who by proper influences 
would not find this a source of ceaseless delight and 
improvement. 

Another resource for family diversion is to be found in 
the various games played by children, and in which the 
joining of older members of the family is always a great 
advantage to both parties, especially those in the open air. 
All medical men unite in declaring that nothing is more 
beneficial to health than hearty laughter ; and surely our 
benevolent Creator would not have provided risibles, and 
made it a source of health and enjoyment to use them, if 
it were a sin so to do. There has been a tendency to 
asceticism, on this subject, which needs to be removed. 
Such commands as forbid foolish laughing and jesting, 
"which are not convenient" and which forbid all idle 
words and vain conversation, can not apply to any thing ex- 
cept what is foolish, vain, and useless. But jokes, laughter, 
and sports, when used in such a degree as tends only to pro- 
mote health and happiness, are neither vain, foolish, nor 
" not convenient." It is the excess of these things, and not 
the moderate use of them, which Scripture forbids. The 
prevailing temper of the mind ■should be serious, yet 
cheerful ; and there are times when relaxation and laughter 
are not only proper but necessary and right for all. There 



298 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

is nothing better for this end than that parents and older 
persons should join in the sports of childhood. Matm-e 
minds can always make such diversions more entertaining 
to children, and can exert a healthful moral influence over 
theii minds ; and at the same time can gain exercise and 
amusement for themselves. How lamentable that so many 
fathers, who could be thus useful and happy vrith. theu" 
children, throw away such opportunities, and wear out 
soul and body in the pm-suit of gain or fame ! 

Another resom'ce for childreq is the exercise of mechan- 
ical skill. Fathers, by providing tools for their boys, and 
showing them how to make wheelbarrows, carts, sleds, and 
various other articles, contribute both to the physical, moral 
and social improvement of their children. And in regard 
to little daughters, much more can be done in this way than 
many would imagme. The writer, blessed with the exam- 
ple of a most ingenious and industrious mother, had not only 
learned before the age of twelve to make dolls, of various 
sorts and sizes, but to cut and fit and sew every article that 
belongs to a doll's wardrobe. This, which was dona by the 
child for mere amusement, secured such a faciKty in me- 
chanical pursuits, that, ever afterward, the cutting and 
fitting of any article of dress, for either sex, was accom- 
plished with entire ease. 

When a little girl begins to sew, her mother can promise 
her a small bed and jpillow, as soon as she has sewed a 
patch quilt for them ; and then a bedstead, as soon as she 
has sewed the sheets and cases for pillows; and then a 
large doll to dress, as soon as she has made the under-gar. 
ments ; and thus go on till the whole contents of the baby- 
house are earned by the needle and skill of its little ovraer. 
Thus the task of learning to sew will become a pleasure ; and 
every new toy will be earned by useful exertion. A little 
girl can be taught, by the aid of patterns prepared for the 
purpose, to cut and fit all articles necessary for her doll. 
She can also be provided with a little wash-tub and irons. 



DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS AND SOCIAL DUTIES. 209 

and thus keep in proper order a complete miniature domes- 
tic establishment. 

Besides these recreations, there are the enjoyments 
secured in walking, riding, visiting, and many other em- 
ployments which need not be recounted. Children, if 
trained to be healthful and indiistrious, will never fail to 
discover resources of amusement ; while their guardians 
should lend their aid to guide and restrain them from excess. 

There is need' of a very great change of opinion and 
practice in this nation in regard to the subject of social and 
domestic duties. Many sensible and conscientious men 
spend all their time abroad in business; except perhaps an 
hour or so at night, when they are so fatigued as to be 
unfitted for any social or intellectual enjoyment. And some 
of the most conscientious men in the country will add to their 
professional business public or benevolent enterprises, which 
demand time, effort, and money ; and then excuse them- 
selves for neglecting all care of their children, and efforts 
for their own intellectual improvement, or for the improve- 
ment of their families, by the plea that they have no time 
for it. 

All this arises from the want of correct notions of the 
binding obligation of our social and domestic duties. The 
main, object of life is not to secure the various gratifications 
of appetite or taste, but to form such a character, for our- 
selves and others, as will secure the greatest amount of 
present and future happiness. It is of far more conse- 
quence, then, that parents should be intelligent, social, 
affectionate, and agreeable at home and to their friends, 
than that they should earn money enough to live in a large 
house and have handsome fm-niture. It is far more need- 
ful for children that a father should attend to the formation 
of their character and habits, and aid in developing their 
social, intellectual, and moral nature, than it is that he 
should eai-h money to furnish them with handsome clothes 
and a variety of tempting food. 



300 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

It will be wise for those parents who find little time to 
attend to their children, or to seek amusement and enjoy- 
ment in the domestic and social circle, because their time 
is so much occupied with public cares or benevolent objects, 
to inquire whether their first duty is not to train up their 
own families to be useful members of society. A man who 
neglects the Uxind and morals of his children, to take cai-e 
of the public, is in great danger of coming under a similar 
condemnation to that of him who, neglecting to provide 
for his own household, has " denied the faith, and is worse 
than an infidel." 

There are husbands and fathers who conscientiously 
subtract time from their business to spend at home, in 
reading with their wives and children, and in domestic amuse- 
ments which at once refresh and improve. The children 
of such parents will grow up with a love of home and 
kindred which will be the greatest safeguard against future 
temptations, as well as the purest source of earthly 
enjoyment. 

There are families, also, who make it a definite object to 
keep up family attachments, after the children are scattered 
abroad ; and, in some cases, secure the means for doing this 
by saving money which would otherwise have been spent 
for superfluities of food or dress. Some families have 
adopted, for this end, a practice which, if widely imitated, 
would be productive of much enjoyment. The method is 
this : On the first day of each month, some member of the 
family, at each extreme point of dispersion, takes a folio 
sheet, and fills a part of a page. This i^sealed and mailed 
to the next family, who read it, add another contribution, 
and then mail it to the next. Thus the family circular, 
once a month, goes from each extreme to all the members 
of a widely-dispersed family, and each member becomes a 
sharer in the joys, sorrows, plans, and pursuits of all the 
rest. At the same time, frequent family meetings are 
sought ; and the expense thus incurred is cheerfully met by 



DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS Aim SOCIAL DUTIES. 801 

retrenchments in other directions. The sacrifice of some 
unnecessary physical indulgence will often purchase many 
social and domestic enjoyments, a thousand times more 
elevating and delightful than the retrenched luxury. 

There is no social duty which the Supreme Law-givei 
more strenuously urges than hospitality and kindness to 
strangers, who are classed with the widow and the fatherless 
as the special objects of Divine tenderness. There are some 
reasons why this duty peculiarly demands attention from 
the American people. 

Reverses of fortune, in this land, are so frequent and un- 
expected, and the habits of the people are so migratory, that 
there are very many in every part of the coimtry who, hav- 
ing seen all their temporal plans and hopes crushed, are now 
pining among strangers, bereft of wonted comforts, without 
friends, and without the sympathy and society so needful to 
wounded spirits. Such, too frequently, sojourn long and 
lonely, with no comforter but TTim who "knoweth the 
heart of a stranger." 

Whenever, therefore, new-comers enter a community, 
inquiry should immediately be made as to whether they have 
friends or associates, to render sympathy and kind atten- 
tions ; and, when there is any need for it, the ministries of 
Mnd neighborliness should immediately be offered. And it 
should be remembered that the first days of a stranger's 
sojourn are the most dreary, and that civility and kindness 
are doubled in value by being offered at an early period. 

In social gatherings the claims of the stranger are too 
^pt to be forgotten ; especially in cases where there are no 
peculiar attractions of personal appearance, or talents, or 
high standing. Such a one should be treated with attention, 
heocmse he is a stranger ; and when communities learn to 
act more from principle, and less from selfish impulse, on 
this subject, the sacred claims of the stranger will be less 
frequently forgotten. 

The most agreeable hospitality to visitors who become 



302 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

inmates of a family, is that which puts them entirely at 
ease. This can never be the case where the guest per- 
ceives that the order of family arrangement is essentially 
altered, and that time, comfort, and convenience are sacri- 
ficed for his accommodation. 

Offering the best to visitors, showing a polite regard to 
every wish expressed, and giving precedence to them, in all 
mattei'S of comfort and convenience, can be easily combined 
with the easy freedom which makes the stranger feel at 
home; and this is the perfection of hospitable entertain- 
ment.

OABB OF THE AGED. 

One of the most interesting and instructive, illustrations 
of the design of. our Creator, in the institution of the family 
state, is the preservation of the aged after their faculties 
decay and usefulness in ordinary modes seems to be ended. 
By most persons this period of infirmities and uselessness is 
anticipated with apprehension, especially in the case of 
those who have lived an active, useful life, giving largely of 
service to others, and dependent for most resources of en- 
joyment on their own energies. 

To lose the resources of sight or hearing, to become fee- 
ble in body, so as to depend on the ministries of others, and 
finally to gradually decay in mental force and intelligence, 
to many seems far worse than death. Multitudes have 
prayed to be taken from this life when their usefulness is 
thus ended. 

But a true view of the design of the family state, and of 
the ministry of the aged and helpless ia carrying out this 
design, would greatly lessen such apprehensions, and might 
be made a source of pure and elevated enjoyment. 

The Christian virtues of patience with the unreasonable, 
of self-denying labor for the weak, and of sympathy with 
the afl^cted, are 4ependent, to a great degree, on cultivation 
and habit, and these can be gained only in circumstances 
demanding the daily exercise of these, graces. In this as- 
pect, continued life in the aged and infirm should be re- 
garded as a blessing and privilege to a family, especially to 
the young, and the cultivation of the graces that are de- 



304 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

manded by that relation should be made a definite and in- 
teresting part of their education. A few of the methods to 
be attempted for this end will be suggested. 

In the first place, the object for which the aged are pre- 
served ia life, when in many cases they would rejoice to de- 
part, should be definitely kept in recollection, and a sense 
of gratitude and obligation be cultivated. They should be 
looked up to and treated as ministers sustained by our 
Heavenly Father iu a painful experience, expressly for the 
good of those arourid them. This appreciation of their 
ministry and usefulness will greatly lessen their trials and 
impart consolation. If ia hours of weariness and infirmity 
they wonder why they are kept in a useless and helpless 
state to burden others around, they should be assured that 
they are not useless ; and this not only by word, but, better 
stUl, by the manifestation of those virtues which such op- 
portimities alone can secure. 

Another mode of cheering the aged is to engage them in 
the domestic games and sports which unite the old and 
the young ia amusement. Many a weary hour may thus 
be enlivened for the benefit of all concerned. And here 
will often occur opportunities of self-denying benevolence 
in relinquishing personal pursuits and gratification thus to 
promote the enjoyment of the infirm and dependent. Head- 
ing aloud is often a great soiu"ce of enjoyment to those who 
by age are deprived of reading for themselves. So the effort 
to gather news of the neighborhood and impart it, is an- 
other mode of relieving those deprived of social gatherings. 

There is no period ia life when those courtesies of good 
breeding which recognize the relations of superior and in- 
ferior should be more carefully cherished than when there 
is need of showing them toward those of advancing age 
To those who have controlled a household, and still more to 
those who in public life have been honored and admired, 
the decay of mental powers is peculiarly trying, and every 
effort should be made to lessen the trial by courteous atten- 



CABU OF THE AGED. 305 

tion to their opinions, and by avoiding all attempts to con- 
trovert them, or to make evident any weakness or fallacy iu 
their conversation. 

In regard to the decay of bodily or mental faculties, much 
more can be done to prevent or retard them than is gen- 
rally supposed, and some methods for this end which 
have been gained by observation or experience wiU be pre- 
sented. 

As the exercise of all our faculties tends to increase their 
power, unless it be carried to excess, it is very important 
that the aged should be provided with useful employment, 
suited to their strength and capacity. Nothing hastens de- 
cay so fast as to remove the stimulus of useful activity. It 
should become a study with those who have the care of the 
aged to interest them' in some useful pursuit, and to con- 
vince them that they are. ia some measure actively con- 
tributing to the general welfare. In the country and in 
families where the larger part of the domestic labor is done 
without servants, it is very easy to keep up an interest in 
domestic industrial employments. The tending of a small 
garden in summer — the preparation of fuel and food, the 
mending of household utensils — these and many other occu- 
pations of the hands will keep alive activity and interest, in a 
man ; while for women there are still more varied resources. 
There is nothing that so soon hastens decay and lends 
acerbity to age as giving up all business and responsibility, 
and every mode possible should be devised to prevent this 
result. 

As age advances, all the bodily functions move more 
slowly, and consequently the generation of animal heat, 
by the union of oxygen and carbon in the capillaries, is in 
smaller proportion than in the midday of life. For this 
reason some practices, safe for the vigorous, must be relin- 
quished by the aged ; and one of these is the use of the 
cold bath. It has often been the case that rheumatism has 
been caused by neglect of this caution. More than or- 



306 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

dinary care should be taken to preserve animal lieat in 
the agedj especially in the hands and the feet. 

In many families will be found an aged brother, or sis- 
ter, or other relative who has no home, and no claim to a 
refuge in the family circle but that of kindred. Some- 
times they are poor and homeless, for want of a faculty for 
self-supporting business ; and sometimes they have peculi- 
arities of person or disposition which render their society 
undesirable. These are cases where the pitying tenderness 
of the Saviour should be remembered, and for his sake 
patient kindness and tender care be given, and he will 
graciously accept it as an offering of love and duty to him- 
self. " Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these 
my brethren, ye have done it to me." 

It is sometimes the case that even parents in old age 
have had occasion to say with the forsaken King Lear, 
" How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thank- 
less child !" It is right training in early life alone that 
will save from this. 

In the opening of China and the probable influx of its 
people, there is one cause for congratulation to a nation 
that is failing in the virtue of reverence. The Chinese are 
distinguished above all other nations for their respect for 
the aged, and especially for their reverence for aged pa- 
rents and conformity to their authority, even to the last. 
This virtue is cultivated to a degree that is remarkable, 
and has produced singular and favorable results on the 
national character, which it is hoped may be imparted to 
the land to which they are flocking in such multitudes. 
For with all their peculiarities of pagan philosophy and 
their oriental eccentricities of custom and practical life, 
they are everywhere renowned for their uniform and ele- 
gant courtesy — a most commendable virtue, and one ari- 
sing from habitual deference to the aged more than from 
any other source. 



XXY. 

THE OAEE OF SERVANTS. 

AiiTHOTJGH in earlier ages tlie highest born, wealtliiest, 
and proudest ladies were skilled in the simple labors of the 
household, the advance of society toward luxury has 
changed all that in lands of aristocracy and classes, and at 
the present time America is the only country where there 
is a class of women who may be described as ladies who do 
their own work. By a lady we mean a woman of educa- 
tion, cultivation, and refinement, of liberal tastes and ideas, 
who, without any very material additions or changes, would 
be recognized as a lady ia any circle of the Old World or 
the Ifew. 

The existence of such a class is a fact peculiar to Ameri- 
can society, a plain result of the new principles iavolved in 
the doctrine of universal equality. 

When *he colonists first came to this country, of however 
mixed ingredients their ranks might have been composed, 
and however imbued with the spirit of feudal and aristo- 
cratic ideas, the discipline of the wilderness soon brought 
them to a democratic level ; the gentleman f elledthe wood 
for his log-cabin side by side with the plowman, and 
thews and sinews rose in the market. " A man was deemed 
honorable in proportion as he lifted his hand upon the high 
trees of the forest." So iq the interior domestic circle. 
Mistress and maid, living in a log-cabin together, became 
companions, and sometimes the maid, as the one well-trained 
in domestic labor, took precedence of the mistress. It also 



308 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

became natural and unavoidable that children should begin 
to work as early as they were capable of it. 

The result was a generation of intelligent people brought 
up to labor from necessity, but devoting to the problem of la- 
bor the acuteness of a disciplined brain. The mistress, out- 
done in sinews and muscles by her maid, kept her superior- 
ity by skill and contrivance. If she could not lift a pail of 
water, she could invent methods which made lifting the 
paU unnecessary, — if she could not take a hundred steps 
without weariness, she could make twenty answer the pur- 
pose of a hundred. 

Slavery, it is true, was to some extent introduced into 
New-England, but it never suited the genius of the people, 
never struck deep root or spread so as to choke the good 
seed of self -helpfulness. Many were opposed to it from 
conscientious principle — many from far-sighted thrift, 
and from a love of thoroughness and well-doing which de- 
spised the rude, unskilled work of barbarians. People, hav- 
ing 'once felt the thorough neatness and beauty of execution 
which came of free, educated, and thoughtful labor, could 
not tolerate the climisiness of slavery. 

Thus it came to pass that for many years the rural popu- 
lation of New-England, as a general rule, did their own 
work, both out-doors and in. If there were a black man 
or black woman or bound girl, they were emphatically only 
the helps, following humbly the steps of master and mis- 
tress, and used by them as instruments of lightening cer- 
tain portions of their toil. The master and mistress, with 
their children, were the head workers. 

Great merriment has been excited in the old country 
because, years ago, the first English travelers found that 
the class of persons by them denominated servants, were in 
America denominated help, or helpers. But the term was 
the very best exponent of the state of society. There 
were few servants, in the European sense of the 
word ; there was a society of educated workers, where all 



TBE CASE OF SEH VANTS. 309 

were practically equal, and where, if there was a deficiency 
in one family and an excess in another, a helper, not a ser- 
vant in the European sense, was hired. Mrs. Brown, who 
has several sons and no daughters, enters into agreement 
with Mrs. Jones, who has several daughters and no sons. 
She borrows a daughter, and pays her good wages to help 
in her domestic toil, and sends a son to help the labors of 
Mr. Jones. These two young people go into the families 
in which they are to be employed in all respects as equals 
and companions, and so the work of the community is 
equalized. Hence arose, and for many years continued, a 
state of society more nearly solving than any other ever 
did the problem of combining the highest culture of the 
mind with the highest culture of the muscles and the phy- 
sical faculties. 

Then were to be seen families of daughters, handsome, 
strong women, rising each day to their in-door work with 
cheerful alertness — one to sweep the room, another to make 
the fire, while a third prepared the breakfast for the father 
and brothers who were going out to manly labor : and they 
chatted meanwhile of books, studies, embroidery ; discussed 
the last new poem, or some historical topic started by graver 
reading, or perhaps a rural ball that was to come off next 
week. They spun with the book tied to the distaff; they 
wove ; they did all manner of fine needle-work ; they made 
lace, painted flowers, and, in short, in the boundless con- 
sciousness of activity, invention, and perfect health, set 
themselves to any work they had ever read or thought of. 
A bride in those days was married with sheets and table- 
cloths of her own weaving, with counterpanes and toilet- 
covers wrought in divers embroidery by her own and her sis- 
ters' hands. The amount of fancy-work done in our days 
by girls who have nothing else to do, will not equal what 
was done by these who performed, besides, among them, 
the whole work of the family. 

In those former days most women were in good health, 



310 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

debility and disease being the exception. Then, too, was 
seen the economy of daylight and its pleasures. They 
were used to early rising, and would not lie in bed, if they 
could. Long years of practice made them familiar with 
the shortest, neatest, most expeditious method of doing 
every household office, so that really for the greater part 
of the time in the house there seemed, to a looker-on, to 
be nothing to do. They rose in the morning and dis- 
patched husband, father, and brothers to the farm or wood- 
lot ; went sociably about, chatting with each other, skimmed 
the milk, made the butter, and turned the cheeses. The 
forenoon was long ; ten to one, all the so-called morning 
work over, they had leisure for an hour's sewing or reading 
before it was time to start the dinn-er preparations. By two 
o'clock the house-work was done, and they had the long 
afternoon for books, needle-work, or drawing — for perhaps 
there was one with a gift at her pencil. Perhaps one read 
aloud while others sewed, and managed in that way to 
keep up a great deal of reading. 

It is said that women who have been accustomed to do- 
ing their own work become hard mistresses. They are 
certainly more sure of the ground they stand on — they are 
less open to imposition — they can speak and act in their own' 
houses more as those " having authority," and therefore are 
less afraid to exact what is justly their due, and less willing 
to endure impertinence and unfaithfulness. Their general 
error lies in expecting that any servant ever will do as well 
for them as they will do for themselves, and that an un- 
trained, undisciplined human being ever can do house-work, 
or any other work, with the neatness and perfection that a 
person of trained intelligence can. 

It has been remarked in our armies that the men of cul- 
tivation, though bred in delicate and refined spheres, can bear 
up under the hardships of camp-life better and longer than 
rough laborers. The reason is, that an educated mind 
knows how to use and save its body, to work it and spare 



THE CARE OF SERVANTS. 311 

it, as an uneducated mind can not; and so the college-bred 
youth brings Mmself safely through fatigues which kill the 
unreflective laborer. 

Cultivated, intelligent women, who are brought up to do 
the work of their own families, are labor-saving institutions. 
They make the head save the wear of the muscles. By 
forethought, contrivance, system, and arrangement they 
lessen the amount to be done, and do it with less expense 
of time and strength than others. The old New-England 
motto, Qet your work done up in the forenoon, applied to an 
amount of work which would keep a common Irish servant 
toiling from daylight to sunset. 

A lady living in one of our obscure New-England towns, 
where there were no servants .to be hired, at last, by sending 
to a distant city, succeeded in procuring a raw Irish maid-of- 
all-work, a creature of immense bone and muscle, but of 
heavy, unawakened brain. In one fortnight she established 
such a reign of Chaos and old Night in the kitchen and 
through the house that her mistress, a delicate woman, en- 
cumbered with the care of young children, began seriously 
to think that slie made more work each day than she per- 
formed, and dismissed her. What was now to be done ? 
Fortunately, the daughter of a neighboring farmer was go- 
ing to be married in six months, and wanted a little ready 
money for her trousseau. The lady was informed that 
Miss So-and-so would come to her, not as a servant, but 
aa hired " help." She was fain to accept any help with 
gladaess. 

Forthwith came into the family-circle a tall, well-dressed 
young person, grave, unobtrusive, self-respecting, yet not in 
the least presuming, who sat at the family table and ob- 
served all its decorums with the modest self-possession of a 
lady. The new-comer took a survey of the labors of a 
family of ten members, including four or five young chil- 
dren, and, looking, seemed at once to throw them into sys- 
tem ; matured her plans, arranged her hours of washing, 



312 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

ironing, baking, and cleaning; rose early, moved deftly; 
and in a single day the slatternly and littered kitchen 
assumed that neat, orderly appearance that so often strikes 
one in New-England farm-houses. The work seemed to he , 
all gone. Every thing was nicely washed, brightened, put 
in place, and staid in place ; the floors, when cleaned, re- 
mained clean ; the work was always done, and not doing ; 
ani every afternoon the young lady sat neatly dressed in 
her own apartment, either quietly writing letters to her be- 
trothed, or sewing on her bridal outfit. Such is the result 
of employing those who have been brought up to do their 
own work. That tall, fine-looking girl, for aught we know, 
may yet be mistress of a fine house on Fifth Avenue ; and 
if she is, she will, we fear, prove rather an exacting mis- 
tress to Irish Bridget ; but she will never be threatened by 
her cook and chambermaid, after the first one or two have 
tried the experiment. 

Those remarkable women of old were made by circum- 
stances. There were, comparatively speaking, no servants 
to be had, and so children were trained to habits of indus- 
try and mechanical adroitness from the cradle, and every 
household process was reduced to the very minimum of labor. 
Every step required in a process was counted, every move- 
ment calculated ; and she who took ten steps, when one 
would do, lost her reputation for " faculty." Certainly su^h 
an early drill was of use in developing the health and the 
bodily powers, as well as in giving precision to the practi- 
cal mental faculties. All household economies were ar- 
ranged with equal niceness in those thoughtful minds. A 
trained housekeeper knew just how many sticks of hickory 
of a certain size were required to heat her oven, and how 
many of each different kind of wood. She knew by a sort 
of intuition just what kinds of food would yield the most 
palatable nutriment with the least outlay of accessories in 
cooking. She knew to a minute the time when each arti- 
cle must go into and be withdrawn from her oven ; and if 



TBE VARB OF SERVANTS. 313 

she could only lie in lier chamber and direct, she could 
guide an iatelligent child through the processes with 
mathematical certainty. 

It is impossible, however, that any thing but early train- 
ing and long experience can produce these results, and it 
is earnestly to be wished that the grandmothers of New- 
England had written down their experiences for our chil- 
dren ; they would have been a mine of maxims and tradi- 
tions better than any other " traditions of the elders " which 
we know of. 

In this country, our democratic institutions have removed 
the superincumbent pressure which in the Old "World eon- 
fines the servants to a regular orbit. They come here feel 
ing that this is somehow a land of liberty, and with very 
dim and confused notions of what liberty is. They are 
very extensively the raw, untrained Irish 'peasantry, and the 
wonder is, that, with all the unreasoning heats and preju- 
dices of the Celtic blood, all the necessary ignorance and 
rawness, there should be the measure of comfort and suc- 
cess there is in our domestic arrangements. 

But, as long as things are so, there wiQ be constant 
changes and interruptions in every domestic establishment, 
and constantly recurring interregnums when the mistress 
must put her own hand to the work, whether the hand be 
a trained or an untrained one. As matters now are, the 
young housekeeper takes life a,t the hardest. She has very 
little strength,^-no experience to teach her how to save her 
strength. She knows nothing experinaentally of the sim- 
plest processes necessary to keep her family comfortably 
fed and clothed ; and she has a way of looking at all these 
things which makes them particularly hard and distasteful 
to her. She does not escape being obliged to do house- work 
at intervals, but she does it in a weak, blundering, confused 
way, that makes it twice as hard and disagreeable as it 

need be. 
Now if every young wbman learned to do house-work, 



314 THE EOUSEKEEPER'a MANUAL. 

and cultivated her practical faculties in early life, she 
would, in the first place, be much more likely to keep her 
servants, and, in the second place, if she lost them tempo- 
rarily, would avoid all that wear and tear of the nervous 
system which comes from constant ill-success in those de- 
partments on which family health and temper mainly 
depend. This is one of the peculiarities of our American 
life, which require a peculiar training. Why not face it 
sensibly ? 

Our land is now full of motorpathic institutions to which 
women are sent at a great expense to have hired operators 
stretch and exercise their inactive muscles. They lie for 
hours to have their feet twigged, their arms flexed, and all 
the different muscles of the body worked for them, because 
they are so flaccid and torpid that the powers of life do not 
go on. Would it not be quite as cheerful, and a less expen- 
sive process, if young girls frorn early life developed the 
muscles in sweeping, dustmg, starching, ironing, and all 
the multiplied domestic processes which our grandmothers 
knew of ? A woman who did all these, and diversifled the 
intervals with spinning on the great and little wheel, did 
not need the gymnastics of Dio Lewis or of the Swedish 
Movement Cure, which really are a necessity now. Does it 
not seem poor economy to pay servants for letting our 
muscles grow feeble, and then to pay operators to exercise 
them for us ? I will venture to say that our grandmothers 
in a week went over every Inovement that any gymnast 
has invented, and went over them to some productive 
purpose too. 

The flrst business of a housekeeper in America is that of 
a teacher. She can have a good table only by having prac- 
tical knowledge, and tact in imparting it. If she under- 
stands her business practically and experimentally, her eye 
detects at once the weak spot ; it requires only a little tact, 
some patience, some clearness in giving directions, and all 
comes right. 



TUB CARE OF SERVANTS. 315 

If we carry a w'atch to a watchmaker, and undertake to 
show him how to regulate the machinery, he laughs and 
goes on his own way ; but if a brother-machinist makes 
suggestions, he listens respectfully. So, when a woman 
who knows nothing of woman's work undertakes to instruct 
one who knows more than she does, she makes no impres- 
sion ; but a woman who has been trained experimentally, 
and shows she imderstands the matter thoroughly, is listened 
to with respect. 

Let a woman make her own bread for one month, and, 
simple as the process seems, it will take as long as that to 
get a thorough knowledge of all the possibilities in the 
case; but after that, she will be able to command good 
bread by the aid of all sorts of servants ; in other words, will 
be a thoroughly prepared teacher. ' 

Although bread-making seems a simple process, it yet re- 
quires delicate care and watchfulness. There are fifty ways 
to spoil good bread ; there are a hundred little things to be 
considered and allowed for, that require accurate observa- 
tion and experience. The same process that will raise good 
bread in cold weather will make sour bread in the heat of 
summer; different qualities of flour require variations in 
treatment, as also different sorts and conditions of yeast ; 
and when all is done, the bakiug presents another series of 
possibilities which require exact attention. , 

A well-trained mind, accustomed to reflect, analyze, and 
generalize, has an advantage over uncultured minds even of 
double experience. Poor as your cook is, she now knows 
more of her business than you do. After a very brief period 
of attention and experiment, you will not only know more 
than she does, but you will conviace her that you do, which 
is quite as much to the purpose. 

In the same manner, lessons must be given on the 
washing of silver and the makiug of beds. Good servants 
do not often come to us ; they must be made by patience 
and training ; and if a girl has a good disposition and a

reasonable degree of handiness, and the housekeeper under- 
stands her profession, a good servant may 1)6 made out of 
an indifferent one. Some of the best girls, have been those 
who came directly from the ship, with no preparation but 
docility and some natural quickness. The hardest cases to 
be managed are not of those who have been taught nothing, 
but of those who have been taught wrongly — who come 
self-opinionated, with ways which are distasteful, and con- 
trary to the genius of one's housekeeping. Such require 
that their mistress shall understand at least so much of the 
actual conduct of affairs as to prove to the servant that 
there are better ways than those in which she has been 
trained. 

So much has been said of the higher sphere of woman, 
and so much has been done to find some better Work for 
her that, insensibly, almost every body begins to feel that it 
is rather degradiag for a woman in good society to be much 
tied down to family affairs ; especially since in these Wo- 
man's Eights Conventions there is so much dissatisfaction 
expressed at those who would confine her ideas to the 
kitchen and nursery. 

Yet these Woman's Eights Conventions are a protest 
against many former absurd, unreasonable ideas — the mere 
physical and culinary idea of womanhood as connected only 
with puddings and shirt-buttons, the unjust and unequal 
burdens which the laws of harsher ages had cast upon the 
sex. Many of the women connected with these movements 
are as superior in every thing properly womanly as they 
are in exceptional talent and culture. There is no manner 
of doubt that the sphere of woman is properly to be 
enlarged. Every woman has rights as a human being 
which belong to no sex, and ought to be as freely conceded 
to her as if she were a man, — and first and foremost, the 
great right of doing any thing which God and nature evi- 
dently have fitted her to excel in. If she be made a natural 
orator, like Miss Dickinson, or an astronomer, like Mrs.

Somerville, or" a singer, like Grisi, let not the teclinical rnlea 
of womanhood be thrown in the way of her free use of her 
powers. 

Still, ^er conira, there has been a great deal of cmde, dis- 
agreeable talk in these conventions, and too great tendency 
of the age to make the education of woman anti-domestic. 
I b seems as if the world never could advance, except like 
ships under a head-wind, tacking and going too far, now in 
this direction, and now in the opposite. Our common- 
school system now rejects sewing from the education of 
girls, which very properly used to occupy many hours daily 
in school a generation ago. The daughters of laborers and 
artisans are put through algebra, geometry, trigonometry, 
and the higher mathematics, to the entire neglect of that 
learning which belongs distinctively to woman." A girl of- 
ten can not keep pace with her class, if she gives any time 
to domestic matters ; and accordingly she is excused from 
them all during the whole term of her education. The boy 
of a family, at an early age, is put to a trade, or the labors of 
a farm ; the father becomes impatient of his support, and 
requires of him to take care for himself. Hence an in- 
terrupted education — ^learning coming by snatches in the 
winter months or in the intervals of work. 

As the result, the young women in some of our country 
towns are, in mental culture, much in advance of the males 
of the same household ; but with this comes a physical deli- 
cacy, the result of an exclusive use of the brain and a 
neglect of the muscular system, with great inefficiency in 
practical domestic duties. The race of strong, hardy, cheer- 
ful girls, that used to grow up in country places, and made 
the bright, neat, New-England kitchens of old times — the 
girls that could wash, iron, brew, bake, harness a horse and 
drive him, no less than braid straw, embroider, draw, paint, 
and read innumerable books — this race of women, pride of 
olden time, is daily lessening ; and in their stead come the 
fragile, easily-fatigued, languid girls of a modern age, 



318 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

drilled in book-learning, ignorant of common things. Tho 
great danger of all this, and of the evils that come from it, 
is, that society, by and by, will turn as blindly against female 
intellectual culture as it now advocates it, and having 
worked disproportionately one way, will work dispropor- 
tionately in the opposite direction. 

Domestic service is the great problem of life here in Amer- 
ica ; the happiness of families, their thrift, well-being, and 
comfort, are more affected by this than by any one thing else. 
The modem girls, as they have been brought up, can not 
perform the labor of their own families as in those simpler, 
old-fashioned days ; and what is worse, they have no practical 
skill with which to instruct servants, who come to us, as a 
class, raw and xmtrained. In the present state of prices, 
the board of a domestic costs double her wages, and the 
waste shie makes is a more serious matter still. 

Many of the domestic evils in America originate in the 
fact that, while society here is professedly based on new 
principles which ought to make social life in every respect 
different from the life of the Old World, yet these prin- 
ciples have never been so thought out and applied as 
to give consistency and harmony to our daily relations. 
America starts with a political organization based on a 
declaration of the primitive freedom and equality of 
all men. Every human being, according to this-principle, 
stands on the same natural level with every other, and has 
the same chance to rise according to the degree of power or 
capacity given by the Creator. All our civil institutions 
are designed to preserve this equality, as far as possible, 
from generation to generation : there is no entailed prop- 
erty," there are no hereditary titles, no monopolies, no privi- 
leged classes — all are to be as free to rise and fall as the 
waves of the sea. 

The condition of domestic service, however, still retains 
about it something of the influences from feudal times, and 
from the near presence of slavery in neighboring States. 



THE CAME OF SERVANTS. 319 

All English literature of the world describes domestic 
service in the old feudal spirit and with the old feudal 
langxiage, which regarded the master as belonging to a 
privileged class and the servant to an inferior one. There 
is not a play, not a poem, not a novel, not a history, that 
does not present this view. The master's rights, like the 
rights of kings, were supposed to rest in his being bom in a 
superior rank. The good servant was one whc, from child- 
hood, had learned " to order himself lowly and reverently 
to all his betters." When New-England brought to these 
shores the theory of democracy, she brought, in the persons 
of the first pilgrims, the habits of thought and of action 
formed in aristocratic communities. "Winthrop's Journal, 
and all the old records of the earlier colonists, show house- 
holds where masters and mistresses stood on the " right di- 
vine" of the privileged classes, howsoever they might have 
risen up against authorities themselves. 

The first consequence of this state of things was a uni- 
versal rejection of domestic service in all classes of Ameri- 
can-born society. For a generation or two there was, in- 
deed, a sort of interchange of family strength, — sons and 
daughters engaging in the service of neighboring families, 
in default of a sufficient working-force of their own, but 
always on conditions of strict equality. The assistant was 
to share the table, the family sitting-room, and every honor 
and attention that might be claimed by son or daughter. 
When families increased in refinement and education so aa 
to make these conditions of close intimacy with more un- 
cultured neighbors disagreeable, they had to choose between 
such intimacies and the performance of their own domestic 
toil. No wages could induce a son or daughter of New- 
England to take the condition of a servant on terms which 
they thought applicable to that of a slave. The slightest 
hint of a separate table was resented as an insult ; not to 
enter the front door, and not to sit in the front parlor on 
state occasions, "wafl bitterly commented on as a personal 
indignity. 



320 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

The well-taiight, self-respecting daughters of farmers, 
the class most valuable in domestic service, gradually re- 
tired from it. They preferred any other employment, how- 
ever laborious. Beyond all doubt, the labors of a well-regu- 
lated family are more healthy, more cheerful, more inter- 
esting, because less monotonous, than the mechanical toils 
of a factory ; yet the girls of New-England, with one con- 
sent, preferred the factory, and left the whole business of 
domestic service to a foreign population ; and they did it 
mainly because they would not take positions in families 
as an inferior laboring-class by the side of others of their 
own age who assumed as their prerogative to live without 
labor. 

" I can't let you have one of my daughters," said an 
energetic matron to her neighbor from the city, who was 
seeking for a servant in her summer vacation; "if you 
hadn't daughters of your own, may be I would ; but my 
girls are not going to work so that your girls may live in 
idleness." 

It was vain to offer money. " "We don't need your money, 
ma'am ; we can support ourselves in other ways,; my girls 
can braid straw, and bind shoes, but they are not going to 
be slaves to any body." 

In the Irish and German servants who took the place of 
Americans in families, there was, to begin with, the tradi- 
tion of education in favor of a higher class ; but even the 
foreign population became more or less infected with the 
spirit of democracy. They came to this country with 
vague notions of freedom and equality, and in ignorant and 
uncultivated people such ideas are often more unreasonable 
for being vague. They did not, indeed, claim a seat at the 
table and in the parlcSr, but they repudiated many of those 
habits of respect and courtesy which belonged to their 
former condition, and asserted their own will and way in 
the round, unvarnished phrase which they suppose)! to be 
their right as republican citizens. Life became a sort of 



TSB CAJtB OF SERVANTS. 821 

domestic wrangle and struggle between the employers, 
who secretly confessed their weakness, but endeavored 
openly to assume the air and bearing of authority, and 
the employed, who knew their power and insisted on their 
jmvileges. 

From this cause domestic service in America has had less 
of mutual kindliness than in old countries. Its terms have 
been so ill-understood and defined that both parties have as- 
sumed the defensive ; and a common topic of conversation 
in American female society has often been the general ser- 
vile war which in one form or another was going on in 
their different families — a war as interminable as would be 
a struggle between aristocracy and common people, unde- 
fined by any bill of rights or constitution, and therefore 
opening fields for endless disputes. 

In England, the class who go to service are a class, and 
service is a profession; the distance between them and their 
employers is so marked and defined, and all the customs 
and requirements of the position are so perfectly under- 
stood, that the master or mistress has no fear of being com- 
promised by condescension, and no need of the external voice 
or air of authority. The higher up in the social scale one 
goes, the more courteous seems to become the intercourse 
of master and servant; the more perfect and real the 
power, the more is it veiled in outward expression — com- 
mands are phrased as requests, and gentleness of voice and 
manner covers an authority which no one would think of 
offending without trembling. 

But in America all is undefined. In the first place, 
there is no class who mean to make domestic service a pro- 
fession to live and die in. It is universally an expedient, a 
stepping-stone to something higher ; your best servants al- 
ways have some thing else in view as soon as they have laid 
by a little money ; some form of independence w^ich shall 
give them a home of their own is constantly in mind. 
Families look forward to the buying of landed homesteads, 



322 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

and the scattered brothers and sisters work awhile in do- 
mestic service to gain the common fund for the purpose ; 
your seamstress intends to become a dressmaker, and take 
in wo"rk at her own house ; your cook is pondering a mar- 
riage with the baker, which shall transfer her toils from 
your cooking-stove to her own. 

Young women are eagerly rushing into every other em- 
ployment, till feminine trades and callings are all over- 
stocked. "We are continually harrowed with tales of the 
suiferings of distressed needle-women, of the exactions arfd 
extortions practiced on the frail sex in the many branches 
of labor and trade at which they try their hands ; and yet 
women will encounter all these chances of ruin and starva- 
tion rather than make up their minds to permanent domes- 
tic service. 

Now, what is the matter with domestic service ? One 
would think, on the face of it, that a calling which gives a 
settled home, a comfortable room, rent-free, with fire and 
lights, good board and lodging, and steady, well-paid wages, 
would certainly offer more attractions than the making of 
shirts for tenpence, with all the risks of providing one's 
own sustenance and shelter. 

Is it not mainly from the want of a definite idea of the 
true position of a servant under our democratic institu- 
tions that domestic service is so shunned and avoided in 
America, and that it is the very last thing which an intelli- 
gent young woman will look to for a living ? It is more 
the want of personal respect toward those in that position 
than the labor incident to it which repels our people from 
it. Many would be willing to perform these labors, but 
they are not willing to place themselves in a situation 
where their self-respect is hourly wounded by the implica- 
tion of a degree of inferiority, which does not follow any kind 
of labor or service in this cowntry hut that of the family ^ 

There exists in the minds of employers an unsuspected 
spirit of superiority, which is stimulated into an active 



THE CARE OF SERVANTS. 323 

form by the resistance which democracy inspires in the 
working-class. Many families think of servants only as a 
necessary evil, their wages as exactions, and all that is al- 
lowed them as so much taken from the family ; and they 
seek in every way to get from them as much and to give 
them as little as possible. Their rooms are the neglected, 
iU-furnished, incommodious ones — and the kitchen is the 
most cheerless and comfortless place in the house. 

Other families, more good-natured and liberal, provide 
their domestics with more suitable accommodations, and 
are more indulgent; but there is still a latent spirit of 
something Kke contempt for the position. That they treat 
their servants with so much consideration seems to them a 
merit entitling them' to the most prostrate gratitude ; and 
they are constantly disappointed and shocked at that want 
of sense of inferiority on the part of these people which 
leads them to appropriate pleasant rooms, good furniture, 
and good Kving as mere matters of common justice. 

It seems to be a constant surprise to some employers that 
servants should insist on having the same human wants as 
themselves. Ladies who yawn in their elegantly furnished 
])arlors, among books and pictures, if they have not com- 
pany, parties, or opera to diversify the evening, seem as- 
tonished and half indignant that cook and chambermaid 
are more disposed to go out for an evening gossip than to 
sit on hard chairs in the kitchen where they have been toil- 
ing all day. The pretty chambermaid's anxieties about her 
dress, the minutes she spends at her small and not very 
clear mirror, are sneeringly noticed by those whose toilet- 
cares take up serious hours ; and the question has never ap- 
parently occurred to them why a serving-maid should not 
want to look pretty as wdl as her mistress. She is a wo- 
man as well as they, with all a woman's wants and weak- 
nesses ; and her dress is as much to her as theirs to them. 

A vast deal of trouble among servants arises from im- 
pertinent interferences and petty tyrannical exactions on the 



324 , THE BOVSEKEEPER'8 MANUAL. 

part of employers. Now, tlie authority of the master and 
mistress of a house in regard to their domestics extends 
simply to the things they have contracted to do and the 
hours during which they have contracted to serve ; other- 
wise than this, they have no more right to interfere with 
them in the disposal of their time than with any mechanic 
whom they employ. They have, indeed, a right to regulate 
the hours of their own household, and servants can, choose 
between conformity to these hours and the loss of their 
situation ; but, within reasonable limits, their right to conte 
and go at their own discretion, in their own time, should be 
unquestioned. 

If employers are troubled by the fondness of their ser- 
vants for dancing, evening company, and late hours,. the 
proper mode of proceeding is to make ihese matters a sub- 
ject of distinct contract in hiring. The more strictly and 
perfectly the business matters of the first engagement of 
domestics are conducted, the more likelihood^ there is of 
mutual quiet and satisfaction in the relation. It is quite 
competent to every housekeeper to say what practices are 
or are not consistent with the rules of her family, and what 
wiU be inconsistent with the service for which she agrees 
to pay. It is much better to regulate such affairs by cool 
contract in the outset than by warm altercations and pro- 
tracted domestic battles. 

As to the terms of social intercourse, it seems somehow 
to be settled in the minds of many employers that their 
servants owe them and their family more respect than they 
and the family owe to the servants. But do they ? What 
is the relation of servant to employer in a democratie 
country ? Precisely that of a person who for money per- 
forms any kind of service for you. The carpenter comes 
into your house to put up a set o shelves — the cook comes 
into your kitchen to cook your dinner. You never think 
that the carpenter owes^ou any more respect than you owe 
to him because he is in your house doing your behests; he 



TKB CARE OF SERVANTS. 325 

IS your fellow-citizen, you treat him witli respect, you ex- 
pect to be treated with respect by him. You have a claim 
on him that he shall do your work according to your direc- 
tions — no more. 

Now, I apprehend that there is a very common notion as 
to the position and rights of servants which is quite diflPer- 
ent from this. Is it not a common feeling that a servant 
is one who may be treated with a degree of freedom by 
every member of the family which he or she may not re- 
turn ? Do not people feel at liberty to question servants 
about their private affairs, to comment on their dress and 
appearance, ia a manner which they would feel to be an 
impertinence, if reciprocated ? Do they not feel at liberty 
to express dissatisfaction with their performances in rude 
and imceremonious terms, to reprove them in the presence 
of company, while yet they require that the dissatisfaction 
of servants shall be expressed only in terms of respect ? A 
woman would not feel herself at liberty to talk to her mil- 
liner or her dress-maker in language as devoid of considera- 
tion as she will employ toward her cook or chambermaid.. 
And yet both are rendering her a service which she pays 
for in money, and one is no more made her inferior thereby 
than the other. Both have an equal right to be treated 
with courtesy. The master and mistress of a house have a 
right to require courteous treatment from all whom their 
roof shelters; but they have no more right to exact it 
of servants than of every guest and every chUd, and they 
themselves owe it as much to servants as to guests. 

In order that servants may be treated with respect and 
courtesy, it is not necessary, as in simpler patriarchal days, 
that they sit at the family-table. Your carpenter or plumb- 
er does not feel hurt that you do not ask him to dine with 
you, nor your milliner and mantaa-maker that you do not 
exchange ceremonious calls and invite them to your parties. 
It is well understood that your relations with them are of a 
mere business character. They never take it as an assump- 
tion of superiority on your part that you do not admit them 



326 THE EOUSEKBEPER'S MANUAL. 

to relations of private intimacy. There may be the most 
perfect respect and esteem and even friendship between 
them and you, notwithstanding. So it may be in the case 
of servants. It is easy to make any person nnderstand that - 
there are quite other reasons than the assumption of person- 
al superiority for not wishing to admit servants to the family 
privacy. It was not, in fact, to sit in the parlor or at the 
table, in themselves considered, that was the thing aimed at 
by New-England girls ; these were valued only as signs that 
they were deemed worthy of respect and consideration, and, 
where freely conceded, were often in point of fact declined. 

Let servants feel, in their treatment by their employers 
and in the atmosphere of the family, that their position is 
held to be a respectable one ; let them feel, in the mistress 
of the family, the charm of unvarying consideration and 
good manners; let their work-rooms be made convenient 
and comfortable, and their private apartments bear some 
reasonable comparison in point of agreeableness to those of 
other members of the family, and domestic service will be 
more frequently sought by a superior and self-respecting 
class. There are families in which such a state of things 
prevails; and such families, amid 'the many causes which 
unite to make the tenure of service uncertain, have gene- 
rally been able to keep good permanent servants. 

There is an extreme into which kindly disposed people 
often ran with regard to servants which may be men- 
tioned here. They make pets of them. They give extrava- 
gant wages and indiscreet indulgences, and, through indo- 
lence and easiness of temper, tolerate neglect of duty. 
Many of the complaints of the ingratitude of servants 
come from those who have spoiled them in this way ; while 
many of the longest and most harmonious domestic unions 
have sprung from a simple, quiet course of Christian justice 
and benevolence, a recognition of servants as f eUow-beings 
and fellow-Christians, 8,nd a doing to them as we would in 
like circumstances that they should do to us. 

The mistresses of American families, whether they like 



THE CARE OF SERVANTS. 327 

it or not, have the duties of missionaries imposed upon them 
by that class from which our supply of domestic servants is 
drawn. They may as well accept the position cheerfully, 
and, as one raw, untrained hand after another passes 
through their family, and is instructed by them in the mys- 
teries of good house-keeping, comfort themselves, with the 
reflection that they are doing something to form good wives 
and mothers for the republic. 

The complaints made of Irish girls are numerous and 
loud ; the failings of green Erin, alas ! are but too open 
and manifest ; yet, in arrest of judgment, let us move this 
consideration : let us imagine our own daughters between 
the ages of sixteen and twenty-four, untaught and inexperi- 
enced in domestic affairs as they commonly are, shipped to 
a foreign shore to seek service in families. It may be ques- 
tiohed whether, as a whole, they would do much better. 
The girls that fill our families and do our house-work are 
often of the age of our own daughters, standing f Qr them- 
selves, without mothers to guide them, in a foreign country, 
not only bravely supporting themselves, but sending home 
in every ship remittances to impoverished friends left be- 
hind. If our daughters did as much for us, should we not 
be proud of their energy and heroism ? 

When we go into the houses of our country, we find a . 
majority of well-kept, well-ordered, and even elegant estab- 
lishments, where the only hands employed are those of the 
daughters of Erin. True, American women have been 
their instructors, and many a weary hour of care have they 
had in the discharge of this office; but the result on the 
wliole is beautiful and good, and the end of it, doubtless, 
will be peace. 

Instead, then, of complaining that we can not have our 
own peculiar advantages and those of other nations too, or 
imagining how much better off we should be if things were 
different from what they are, it is much wiser and more 
Ohristianlike to strive cheerfully to conform to actual cir- 



328 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

cimiBtaQces ; and, after remedying all that we can control, 
patiently to submit to what is beyond our power. If do- 
mestics are found to be incompetent, unstable, and uncon- 
formed to their station, it is Perfect Wisdom which ap- 
points these trials to teach us patience, fortitude, and self- 
control ; and if the discipline is met in a proper spirit, it 
will prove a blessing rather than an evil. 

But to judge correctly in regard to some of the evils in- 
volved in the state of domestic service in this country, we 
should endeavor to conceive ourselves placed in the situation 
of those of whom complaint is made, that we niay not ex- 
pect from them any more than it would seem right should 
be exacted from us in similar circumstances. 

It is sometimes urged against domestics that they exact 
exorbitant wages. But what is the rule of rectitude on 
this subject ? Is it not the universal law of labor and of 
trade that an article is to be valued according to its scarcity 
and the demand ? When wheat is scarce, the farmer raises 
his price ; and when a mechanic offers services difficult to 
be obtained, he makes a corresponding increase of price. 
And why is it not right for domestics to act according to a 
rule allowed to be correct in reference to all other trades and 
professions ? It is a fact, that really good domestic service 
must continue to increase in value just in proportion as this 
country waxes rich and prosperous ; thus making the propor- 
tion of those who wish to hire labor relatively greater, and 
the number of those willing to go to service less. 

Money enables the rich to gain many advanta^s which 
those of more limited circumstances can not secure. One 
of these is, securing good servants by offering high 
wages ; and this, as the scarcity of this class increases, will 
serve constantly to raise the price of service. It is right 
for domestics to charge the market value, and this value is 
always decided by the scarcity of the article and the 
amount of demand. Eight views of this subject will some- 
times serve to diminish hard feelings toward those who 



TMB CJJtH OF SERVANTS. 329 

would otherwise be wrongfully regarded as unreasonable 
and exacting. 

Another complaint against servants is that oi instability 
and discontent, leading to perpetual change. But in refer- 
ence to this, let a mother or daughter conceive of their own 
circumstances as so changed that the daughter must go out 
to service. Suppose a place is engaged, and it is then found 
that she must sleep in a comfortless garret; and that, when 
a new domestic comes, perhaps a coarse and dii-ty foreigner, 
she must share her bed with her. Another place is offered, 
where she can have a comfortable room and an agreeable 
room-mate; in such a case, would not both mother and 
daughter think it right to change ? 

Or suppose, on trial, it was found that the lady of the 
house was fretful or exacting and hard to please, or that her 
children were so ungoverned as to be perpetual vexations ; 
or that the work was so heavy that no time was allowed for 
relaxation and the care of a wardrobe ; and another place 
offers where these evils can be escaped ; would not mother 
and daughter here think it right to change ? And is it not 
right for domestics, as well as their employers, to seek 
places where they can be most comfortable ? 

In some cases, this instabiKty and love of change would 
Ibe remedied, if employers would take more pains to make 
a residence with them agreeable, and to attach servants to 
the family by feelings of gratitude and affection. There 
are ladies, even where well-qualified domestics are most 
rare, who seldom find any trouble in keeping good and 
steady ones. And the reason is, that their servants know 
they can not better their condition by any change within 
reach. It is not merely by giving them comfortable rooms, 
and good food, and presents, and privileges, that the attach- 
ment of domestic servants is secured ; it is by the manifesta- 
tion of a friendly and benevolent interest in their comfort 
and improvement. This is exhibited in bearing patiently 
with their faults ; in kindly teaching them how to improve ; 
in shoMang them how to make and take proper care of their 



330 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. ^ 

clothes ; in guarding their health ; in teaching them to read 
if necessary, and supplying them with proper books ; and 
in short, by endeavoring, so far as may be, to supply the 
place of parents. It is seldom that such a course would 
fail to secure steady service, and such affection and grati- 
tude that even higher wages would be ineffectual to tempt 
them away. There would probably be some cases ot un- 
grateful returns ; but there is no doubt that the course in- 
dicated, if generally pursued, would very much lessen the 
evil in question. 

When servants are forward and bold in manners and dis- 
respectful ia address, they may be considerately taught that 
those who are among the best-bred and genteel have cour- 
teous and respectful manners and language to all they meet : 
while many who have wealth, are regarded as vulgar, be- 
cause they exhibit rude and disrespectful manners. The 
very term gentle man indicates the refinement and delicacy 
of address which distinguishes the high-bred from the coarse 
and vulgar. 

In regard to appropriate dress, in most cases it is difficult 
for an employer to iuterf ere, di/recfl/y, with comments or ad- 
vice. The most successful mode is to offer some service in 
mending or making a wardrobe, and when a confidence in 
the kindness of feeling is thus gained, remarks and sugges- 
tions will generally be properly received, and new views of 
propriety and economy can be imparted. In some cases it 
may be well for an employer who, from appearances, antici- 
pates difficulty of this kind, in making the preliminary con- 
tract or agreement to state that she wishes to have the 
room, person, and dress of her servants kept neat and in 
order, and that she expects to remind them of their duty, 
in this particular, if it is neglected. Domestic servants are 
very apt to neglect the care of their own chambers and 
clothing ; and such habits have a most pernicious influence 
on their well-being and on that of their children in future 
domestic life. An employer, then, is bound to exercise a 
parental care over them, in these respects. 



THE CARE OF SERVANTS. 331 

There is oue great mistake, not unfrequently made, in the 
management both of domestics and of children, and that is, 
in supposing that the way to cure defects is by finding f anlt 
as each failing occurs. But instead of this being true, in 
many cases the directly opposite course is the best ; while, in 
all instances, much good judgment is required in order to de- 
cide when to notice faults and when to let them pass unno- 
ticed. There are some minds very sensitive, easily discour- 
aged, and infirm of purpose. Such persons, when they have 
formed habits of negligence, haste, and awkwardness, often 
need expressions of sympathy and encouragement rather 
than reproof. They have usually been found fault with so 
much that they have become either hardened or despond- 
ing ; and it is often the case, that a few words of commend 
ation will awaken fresh efforts and renewed hope. In al 
most every case, words of kindness, confidence, and encour- 
agement should be mingled with the needful admonitions 
or reproof. 

It is a good rule, in reference to this point, to forewarn 
instead of finding fault. Thus, when a thing has been done 
wrong, let it pass unnoticed, till, it is to be done again ; and 
then, a simple request to have it done in the right way will 
secure quite as much, and probably more, willing effort, 
than a reproof administered for neglect. Some persons 
seem to take it for granted that young and inexperienced 
minds are bound to have all the forethought and discretion 
of mature persons ; and freely express wonder and disgust 
when mishaps occur for want of these traits. But it would 
be far better to save from mistake or forgetfulness by pre- 
vious caution and care on the part of those who have 
gained experience and forethought ; and thus many occa- 
sions of complaint and ill-humor will be avoided. 

Those who fill the places of heads of families are not 
very apt to think how painful it is to be chided for neglect 
of duty or for faults of character. If they would some- 
times imagine themselves in the place of those whom they

control, with some person daily administering reproof 
to them, VD. the same tone and style as they employ to 
those who are nnder them, it might serve as a useful check 
to their chidings. It is often the case, that persons who are 
most strict and exacting and least able to make allowances 
and receive palliations, are themselves peculiarly sensitive 
to any thing which implies that they are in fault. By such, 
the spirit implied in the Divine petition, " Forgive us our 
trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us," 
needs especially to be cherished. 

One other consideration is very important. There is no 
duty more binding on Christians than that of patience and 
meekness under provocations and disappointment. Now, 
the tendency of every sensitive mind, when thwarted ia its 
wishes, is to complain and find fault, and that often in tones 
of fretfulness or anger. But there are few servants who 
have not heard enough of the Bible to know that angry or 
fretful fault-finding from the mistress of a family, when 
her work is not done to suit her, is not in agreement with 
the precepts of Christ. They notice and feel the inconsist- 
ency ; and every woman, when she gives way to feelings of 
anger and impatience at the faults of those around her, 
lowers herself ia their respect, while her own conscience, 
imless very much blinded, can not but sufier a wound. 

In speaking of the office of the American mistress as 
being a missionary one, we are far from recommending any 
controversial interference with the religious faith of our 
servants. It is far better to incite them to be good Chris- 
tians iu their own way than to run the risk of shaking their 
faith in all religion by pointing out to them what seem to 
us the errors of that in which they have been educated. 
The general purity of life and propriety of demeanor of so 
many thousands of undefended young girls cast yearly upon 
our shores, with no home but their church, and no shield 
but their religion, are a sufficient proof that this religion 
exerts an influence over them not to be lightly trifled with. 



THE CARE OF SERVANTS. 33S 

But there is a real imity even in opposite Christian forms ; 
and the Roman Catholic servant and the Protestant mis- 
ti'ess, if alike possessed by the spirit of Christ, and striving 
to conform to the Golden Rule, can not help being one in 
heart, though one go to mass and the other to meeting. 

Finally, the bitter baptism through which we have passed, 
the life-blood dearer than our own which has drenched dis- 
tant fields, should remind us of the preciousness of distinc- 
tive American ideas. They who would seek in their foolish 
pride to establish the pomp of liveried servants in America 
are doing that which is simply absurd. A servant can never 
in our country be the mere appendage to another man, to be 
marked like a sheep with the color of his owner ; he must 
be a fellow-citizen, with an established position of his own, 
free to make contracts, free to come and go, and having in 
his sphere titles to consideration and respect just as definite 
as those of any trade or profession whatever. 

Moreover, we can not in this country maintain to any 
great extent large retinues of servants. Even with ample 
fortunes, they are forbidden by the general character of so- 
ciety here, which makes them cumbrous and difficult to 
manage. Every mistress of a family knows that her cares 
increase with every additional servant. Two keep the 
peace with each other and their employer ; three begin a 
possible discord, which possibility increases with four, and 
becomes certain with five or six. Trained housekeepers, 
such as regulate the complicated establishments of the old 
world, form a class that are not, and from the nature 
of the case never wiU be, found in any great numbers in this 
country. All such women, as a general thing, are keeping, 
and prefer to keep, houses of their own. 

A moderate style of housekeeping, small, compact, and 
simple domestic establishments, must necessarily be the gen- 
eral order of life in America. So many openings of profit 
ars to be found in this country, that domestic service neces- 
sarily wants the permanence which forms so agreeable a 
feature of it in the old world. 



334 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

This being the case, it should be an object in America to 
exclude from the labors of the family all that can, with 
greater advantage, be executed out of it by combined labor. 

Formerly, in New-England, soap and candles were to be 
made in each separate family ; now, comparatively few take 
this toil upon them. "We buy soap of the soap-maker, and 
candles of thp candle-factor. This principle might be ex- 
tended much further. In France, no family makes its own 
bread, and better bread can not be eaten than can be 
bought at the appropriate shops. No family does its own 
washing ; the family's linen is all sent to women who, mak- 
ing this their sole profession, get it up with a care and nice- 
ty which can seldom be equaled in any family. 

How would it simplify the burdens of the American 
housekeeper to have washing and ironing day expunged from 
her calendar! How much more neatly and compactly 
could the whole domestic system be arranged ! If aU the 
money that each separate faniily spends on the outfit and 
accommodations for washing and ironing, on fuel, soap, 
starch, and the other requirements, were united in a fund to 
create a laundry for every dozen families, one or two good 
women could do in first rate style what now is very indif- 
ferently done by the disturbance and disarrangement of all 
other domestic processes in these families. Whoever sets 
neighborhood-laundries on foot will do much to solve the 
American housekeeper's hardest problem. 

Again, American women must not try with three servants 
to carry on life in the style which in the old world requires 
sixteen ; they must thoroughly imderstand, and be prepared 
to teach, every branch of housekeeping ; they must study 
to make domestic service desirable, by treating their servants 
in a way to lead them to respect themselves and to feel 
themselves respected ; and there will gradually be evolved 
from the present confusion a solution of the domestic pro- 
blem which shall be adapted to the life of a new and grow 
ing world. 



XXVI. 

CASE OF THE 8I0E. 

It is interesting to notice in the histories of our Lord 
the prominent place given to the care of the sick. When 
he first sent out the apostles, it was to heal the sick as 
well as to preach. Again, when he sent out the seventy, 
their first command was to " heal the sick," and next to 
say, " the kingdom of Grod has come nigh unto you." The 
body was to be healed first, in order to attend to the king- 
dom of God, even when it was " brought nigh." 

Jesus Christ spent more time and labor in the cure of 
men's bodies than in preaching, even if we subtract those 
labors with his earthly father by which family homes 
were provided. When he ascended to the heavens, his last 
recorded words to his followers, as given by Mark, were, 
that his disciples should " lay hands on the sick," that they 
might recover. Still more directly is the duty of care for 
the sick exhibited in the solemn allegorical description of 
the last day. It was those who visited the sick that were 
the blessed ; it was those who did not visit the sick who 
were told to "depart." Thus are we abundantly taught 
that one of the most sacred duties of the Christian family 
is the training of its inmates to care and kind attention to 
the sick. 

Every woman who has the care of young children, or of 
a large family, is frequently called upon to advise what 
ehall be done for some one who is indisposed ; and often, 
in ciicumstances where she must trust solely to her own 



336 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

judgment. In sucli cases, some err by neglecting to do 
any thing at all, till tlie patient is quite sick ; but a still 
greater number err from excessive and injurious dosing. 

Tbe two great causes of the ordinary slight attacks of 
illness in a family, are, sudden chills, which close the 
pores of the skin, and thus affect the throat, lungs, or bow- 
els ; and the excessive or improper use of food. In most 
cases of illness from the first cause, bathing the feet, and 
some aperient drink to induce perspiration, are suitable 
lemedies. 

In case of illness from improper food, or excess in eat- 
ing, fasting for one or two meals, to give the system time 
and chance to relieve itself, is the safest remedy. Some- 
times, a gentle cathartic of castor-oil may be needfal ; but 
it is best first to try fasting. A safe relief from injurious 
articles in the stomach is an emetic of warm water ; but 
to be effective, several tumblerfiils must be given in quick 
succession, and till the stomach can receive no more. 

The following extract from a discourse of Dr. Burne, be- 
fore thei London Medical Society, contains important infor- 
mation : " In civilized life, the causes which are most gene- 
rally and continually operating in the production of dis- 
eases are, affections of the mind, improper diet, and re- 
tention of the intestinal excretions. The undue retention 
of excrementitious matter allows of the absorption of its 
more liquid pai'ts, which is a cause of great impurity to 
the blood, and the excretions, thus rendered hard and 
knotty, act more or less as exttaneous substances, and, by 
their irritation, produce a determination of blood to the 
intestines and to the neighboring viscera, which ultimately 
ends in inflammation. It also has a great effect on the 
whole system ; causes a determination of blood to the head, 
which oppresses the brain and dejects the mind ; deranges 
the functions of the stomach ; causes flatulency ; and pro- 
duces a general state of discomfort." 

Dr. Combe remarks on this subject : " In the natural 



CARE OF THE SICK. 337 

and healthy state, under a proper system of diet, and with 
sufficient exercise, the bowels are relieved regularly, once 
every day." Habit " is powerful in modifying the result, 
and in sustaining healthy action when once fairly establish 
ed. Hence the obvious advantage of observing as much 
regularity in relieving the system, as in taking our meals." 
It is often the case that soliciting nature at a regular pe- 
riod, once a day, wiU remedy constipation without medi- 
cine, and induce a regular and healthy state of the bowels. 
" When, however, as most frequently happens, the consti- 
pation arises from the absence of all assistance from the 
abdominal and respiratory muscles, the first step to be 
taken is, again to solicit their aid ; first, by removing all 
impediments to free respiration, such as stays, waistbands, 
and belts ; secondly, by resorting to such active exercise 
as shall call the muscles into full and regular action ; * and 
lastly, by proportioning the quantity of food to the wants 
of the system, and the condition of the digestive organs. 

" If we employ these means, systematically and perseve- 
ringly, we shall rarely fail in at last restoring the healthy 
action of the bowels, with little aid from medicine. But 
if we neglect these modes, we may go on for years, adding 
pill to pill, and dose to dose, without ever attaining the 
end at which we aim." 

" There is no point in which a woman needs more know- 

* The most effective mode of exercising the abdominal and respiratory 
muscles, in order to remedy constipation, is hy a continuous alternate con- 
traction of the muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm. By contracting 
the muscles of the abdomen, the intestines are pressed inward and up- 
ward, and then the muscles of the diaphragm above contract and preSs 
them downward and outward. Thus the blood is drawn to the torpid 
parts to stimulate to the healthful action, while the agitation moves their 
contents down'^axd. An invalid can thus exercise the abdominal muscles 
in bed. The proper time is just after a meal. This exercise, continued ten 
minutes a day, including short intervals of rest, and persevered in for a 
week or two, will cure most ordinary cases of constipation, provided 
proper food Is taken. Coarse bread and fruit are needed for this purpose" 

in most cases.

ledge and discretion than in administering remedies for 
what seem slight attacks, which are not supposed to re 
quire the attention of a physician. It is little realized that 
purgative drugs are unnatural modes of stimulating the 
internal organs, tending to exhaust them of their secre- 
tions, and to debilitate and disturb the animal economy. 
For this reason, they should be used as little as possible ; 
and fasting, and perspiration, and the other methods 
pointed out, should always be first resorted to." 

"When medicine must be given, it should be borne in mind 
that there are various classes of purgatives, which pro- 
duce very diverse eflfects. Some, like salts, operate to thin 
the blood, and reduce the system ; others are stimulating ; 
and others have a pecuKar operation on certain organs.. 
Of course, great discrimination and knowledge are needed, 
ia order to select the kind which is suitable to the particu- 
lar disease, or to the particular constitution of the invalid. 
This shows the folly of using the many kinds of pills, and 
other quack medicines^ where no knowledge can be had of 
their composition. Pills which are good for one kind of 
disease, might operate as poison in another state of the 
system. 

It is very common in cases of colds, which affect the 
lungs or throat, to continue to try one dose after another 
for relief It will be well to bear in mind at such times, 
that all which goes into the stomach must be first absorbed 
into the blood before it can reach the diseased part ; and that 
there is 'some danger of injm-ing the stomach, or other 
parts of the system, by such a variety of doses, many of 
which, it is probable, will be directly contradictory in 
their nature, and thus neutralize any supposed benefit 
they might separately impart. 

When a cold affects the head and eyes, and also impedes 
breathing through the nose, great relief is gained by a 
wet napkin spread over the upper part of the face, cover- 
ing the nose except an opening for breath. This is to be 



CARE OF TBE SICK. 339 

covered by folds of flannel fastened over the napkin with 
a handkerchief. So also a wet towel over the throat and 
whole chest, covered with folds of flannel, often relieves 
oppressed lungs. 

Ordinarily, a cold can be arrested on its first symptoms 
by coverings in bed and a bottle of hot water, securing 
fi'ee perspiration. Often, at its first appearance, it can be 
stopped by a spoonful or two of whisky, or any alcoholic 
liquor, in hot water, taken on going to bed. "Warm cover- 
ering to induce perspiration will assist the process. These 
simple remedies are safest. Perspiration should always be 
followed by a towel-bath. 

It is very unwise to tempt the appetite of a person who 
is indisposed. The cessation of appetite is the warning of 
nature that the system is in such a state that food can not 
be digested. When food is to be given to one who has no 
desire for it, beef-tea is the best in most cases. 

The following suggestions may be found useful in regard 
to nursing the sick. As nothing contributes more to the 
restoration of health than pure air, it should be a primary 
object to keep a sick-room well ventilated. At least twice 
in the twenty-four hours, the patient should be well cov- 
ered, and fresh air freely admitted from out of doors. 
After this, if need be, the room should be restored to a 
proper temperature, by the aid of an ppen fire. Bedding 
and clothing should also be well aired, and frequently 
changed ; as the exhalations from the body, in sickness, 
are peculiarly deleterious. Frequent ablutions of the 
whole body, if possible, are very useful ; and for these, warm 
water may be employed, when cold water is disagreeable. 

A sick-room should always be kept very neat and in 
perfect order ; and all haste, noise, and bustle should be 
avoided. In order to secure neatness, order, and quiet, in 
case of long illness, the following arrangement should be 
made. Keep a large box for fuel, which viU need to be 
filled only twice in twenty-four hours. Provide also and 



340 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

keep in the room or an adjacent closet, a small tea-kettle, 
a saucepan, a pail of water for drinks and ablutions, a 
pitcher, a covered porringer, two pint bowls, two tumblers, 
two cups and saucers, two wine-glasses, two large and two 
small spoons ; also a dish in which to wash these articles ; 
a good supply of towels and a broom. Keep a slop-bucket 
near by to receive the wash of the room. Procuring all 
these articles at once, will save much noise and confusion. 

"Whenever medicine or food is given, spread a clean tow- 
el over the person or bed-clothing, and get a clean hand- 
kerchief, as nothing is more annoying to a weak stomach 
than the stickiness and soiling produced by medicine and 
food. 

Keep the fire-place neat, and always wash all arti- 
cles and put them in order as soon as they are put of use. 
A sick person has nothing to do but look about the 
room ; and when every thing is neat and in order, a feeling 
of comfort is induced, while disorder, filth, and neglect are 
constant objects of annoyance which, if not complained 
of, are yet felt. 

One very important particular in the case of those who 
are delicate in constitution, as well as in the case of the 
sick, is the preservation of warmth, especially in the hands 
and the feet. The equal circulation of the blood is an im- 
portant element for good health, and this is impossible 
when the extreniities are habitually or frequently cold. It 
is owing to this fact that the coldness caused by wetting 
the feet is so injurious. In cases where disease or a weak 
constitution causes a feeble or imperfect circulation, great 
pains should be taken to dress the feet and hands warmly, 
especially around the wrists and ankles, where the blood- 
vessels are nearest to the surface and thus most exposed to 
cold. Warm elastic wristlets and anklets would save 
many a feeble person frorii increasing decay or disease. 

When the circulation is feeble from debility or disease, 
the union of carbon and oxygen in the capillaries is slow- 



CARE OF TOE SICK. 341 

er than in health, and therefore care should be taken to 
preserve the heat thus generated by warm clothing and 
protection from cold draughts. In nervous debility,, it is 
peculiarly important to preserve the animal heat, for its 
excessive loss especially affects weak nerves. Many an in- 
valid is carelessly and habitually suffering cold feet, who 
would recover health by proper care to preserve animal 
heat, especially in the extremities. 

The following are useful directions for dressing a blister. 
Spread thinly, on a linen cloth, an ointment composed of 
one third of beeswax to two thirds of tallow ; lay this 
upon a linen cloth folded many times. With a sharp 
pair of scissors make an aperture in the lower part of the 
blister-bag, with a little hole above to give it vent. 
Break the raised skin as little as possible. Lay on the 
cloth spread as directed. The blister at first should be 
dressed as often as three times in a day, and the dressing 
renewed each time. Hot fbmentations in most cases will 
be as good as a blister, less painful, and safer. 

Always prepare food for the sick in the neatest and 
most careful manner. It is in sickness that the senses of 
smell and taste are most susceptible of annoyance ; and 
often, little mistakes or negligences in preparing food will 
take away all appetite. 

Food for the sick should be cooked on coals, that no 
smoke may have access to it ; and great care must be taken 
to prevent, by stirring, any adherence to the bottom of the 
cooking vessel, as this always gives a disagreeable taste. 

Keeping clean handkerchiefs and towels at hand, cool 
Lag the pillows, sponging the hands with water, (with care 
to dry them thoroughly,) swabbing the mouth with a 
clean linen rag on the end of a stick, are modes of increas- 
ing the comfort of the sick. Always throw a shawl over 
a sick person when raised up. 

Be careful to understand a physician's directions, and to 
obey them mvpUcitly. If it be supposed that any other 



342 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

person knows better abont tlie case than the physician, 
dismiss the physician, and employ that person in his stead. 

It is always best to consult the physician as to where 
medicines shall be purchased, and to show the articles to 
him before using them, as great impositions are practiced 
in selling old, useless, and adulterated drugs. Always put 
labels on vials of medicine, and keep them out of the 
reach of children. 

Be careful to label all powders, and particularly all 
white powders, as many poisonous medicines in this form 
are easily mistaken for others which are harmless. 

In nursing the sick, always speak gently and cheering- 
ly ; and, while you express sympathy for their pain and 
trials, stimulate them to bear all with fortitude, and with 
resignation to the Heavenly Father who " doth not will- 
ingly afflict," and " who causeth all things to work togeth- 
er for good to them that love him." Offer to read the 
Bible or other devotional books, whenever it is suitable, 
and will not be deemed obtrusive. 

Miss Ann Preston, one of the most refined as well as 
talented and learned female physicians, in a published ar- 
ticle, gives valuable instruction as to the training of nurses. 
She claims that every woman should be trained for this 
office, and that some who have special traits that fit them 
for it should make it their daily professional business. She 
remarks that the indispensable qualities in a good nurse 
are common sense, conscientiousness, and sympathetic 
benevolence : and thus continues : 

" God himself made and commissioned one set of 
nurses ; and in doing this and adapting them to utter 
helplessness and weakness, what did he do ? He made 
them to love the dependence and to see something to ad- 
mire in the very perversities of their charge. He made 
them to humor the caprices and regard both reasonable 
and unreasonable complainings. He made them to bend 
tenderly over the disturbed and irritated, and fold them to

quiet assurance in arms made soft with love ; in a word he 
made mothers ! And, other things being equal, whoever 
has most maternal tenderness and warm sympathy with iiie 
sufferer is the best nurse.".- And it is those most nearly 
endowed by nature with these traits who should be select- 
ed to be trained for the sacred office of nm-se to the sick, 
while, in all the moral training of womanhood, this ideal 
should be. the aim. 

Again, Miss Preston wisely suggests that " persons may 
be conscientious and benevolent and possess good judg- 
ment in many respects, and yet be miserable nurses of the 
sick for want of training and right knowledge. 

" Knowledge, the assurance that one knows what to do, 
always gives presence of mind — and presence of mind is 
important not only in a sick-room but in every home. 
Who has not known consternation in a family when some 
one has .fainted, or been burned, or cut, while none were 
present who knew how to stop the flowing blood, or revive 
the fainting, or apply the saving application to the burn ? 
And yet knowledge and efficiency in such cases would save 
many a life, and be a most fitting and desirable accom- 
plishment in every woman." 

" We are slow to learn the mighty influence of common 
agencies, and the greatness of little things, in their bear- 
ing upon life and health. The woman who believes it 
takes no strength to bear a little noise or some disagreea- 
b .e announcements, and loses patience with the weak, ner- 
vous invalid who is agonized with creaking doors or shoes, 
or loud, shrill voices, or rustling papers, or sharp, fidgety 
motions, or the whispering so common in sick-rooms and 
often so acutely distressing to the sufferer, will soon cor- 
rect such misapprehensions by herself experiencing a ner- 
vous fever." 

Here the writer would put in a plea for the increasing 
multitudes of nervous sufferers not confined to a sick- 
room, and yet exposed to all the varied sources of pain in- 



344 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

cident to an exhausted nervous system, which often cause 
more intolerable and also more wearing pain than other 
kinds of suffering. 

" An exceeding acuteness of the senses is the result of 
many forms of nervous disease. A heavy breath, an 
ur washed hand, a noise that would not have been noticed 
in health, a crooked table-cover or bed-spread may disturb 
or oppress ; and more than one invalid has spoken in my 
hearing of the sickening effect produced by the nurse 
tasting her food, or blowing in her drinks to make them 
cool. One woman, and a sensible woman too, told me hex 
nurse had turned a large cushion upon her bureau with the 
back part in front. She determined not to be disturbed 
nor to speak of such a trifl.e, but after struggling three liowrs 
in vain to banish the annoyance, she was forced to ask to 
have the cushion placed right." 

In this place should be mentioned the suffering caused 
to persons of reduced nervous power not only by the smoke 
of tobacco, but by the fetid effluvium of it from the breath 
and clothiag of persons who smoke. Many such are sick- 
ened in society and in car-traveling, and to a degree little 
imagined by those who gain a dangerous pleasure at the 
frequent expense of the feeble and suffering. 

Miss Preston again remarks, " It is often exceedingly 
important to the very weak, who can take but very little 
nutriment, to have that little whenever they want it. T 
have known invalids sustain great injury and suffering ; 
when exhausted for want of food, they have had to wait 
and wait, feeling as if every minute was an hour, while 
some well-fed nurse delayed its coming. Said a lady, ' It 
makes me hungry now to think of the meals she brought 
me upon that little ■waiter when I was sick, such brown 
thin toast, such good broiled beef, such fragrant tea, and 
every thing looking so exquisitely nice I If at any time I 
did not think of any thing I wanted, nor ask for food, she 
did not annoy me with questions, but brought some little 



CASE OF TSE SICK. 345 

delicacy at tlie proper time, and wlieii it came, I could 
take it.' 

" If there is one pxirpose of a personal kind for which it 
is especially desirable to lay up means, it is for being well 
nursed in sickness ; yet in the present state of society, this 
is absolutely impossible, even to the wealthy, because of the 
scarcity of competent nurses. Families worn down with 
the long and extreme illness of a member require relief 
from one whose feelings will be less taxed, and who can 
better endure the labor. 

" But alas ! how often is it impossible, for love or money, 
to obtain one capable of taking the burden from the ex- 
hausted sister or mother or daughter, and how often in 
consequence they have died prematurely or struggled 
through weary years with a broken constitution. Appeal 
to those who have made the trial, and you will find that 
very seldom have they been able to have those who by na- 
ture or by training were competent for their duties. Ig- 
norant, unscrupulous, inattentive — ^how often t^ey disturb 
and injure the patient ! A physician told me that one of his 
patients had died because the nurse, contrary to orders, had 
at a critical period washed her with cold water. I have 
known one who, by stealth, quieted a fretful child with 
laudanum, and of others who exhausted the sick by inces- 
sant talking. One lady said that when, to escape this dis- 
tressing garrulity, she.closed her eyes, the nurse exclaimed 
aloud, ' Why, she is going to sleep while I am talking to 
her.' 

" A few only of the sensible, quiet, and loving women, 
whose presence everywhere is a blessing, have qualified 
themselves and followed nursing as a business.. Heaven 
bless that few 1 What a sense of relief have I seen pervade 
a family when such a one has been procured ; and what a 
treasure seemed found ! 

" There is very commonly an extreme susceptibility in the 
sick to the moral atmosphere about them. They feel the

healthful influence of the presence of a true-hearted at- 
teiidant and repose in it, though they may not be able to 
define the cause; while dissimulation, falsehood, reckless- 
ness, coarseness, jar terribly and injuriously on their height- 
ened sensibilities. ' Are the Sisters of Charity really bet- 
ter nurses than most other women V I asked an intelligent 
lady who had seen much of our military hospitals. ' Yes, 
they are,' was her reply. ' Why should it be so ?' 'I think 
it is because with tbem it is a work of self-abnegation, and 
of duty to God, and they are so quiet and self-forgetful in 
its exercise that they do it better, while many other women 
show such self-consciousness and are so fussy !" 

Is there any reason why every Protestant woman should 
not be trained for this self-denying office as a duty owed to 
Ood? 

We can not better close this chapter than by one more 
quotation from the same intelligent and attractive writer : 
"The good nurse is an artist. O tbe pillowy, soothing 
softness of her touch, the neatness of her simple, unrustling 
dress, the music of her assured yet gentle voice and tread, 
the sense of security and rest inspired by her kind and hope- 
ful face, the promptness and attention to every want, the 
repose that like an atmosphere encircles her, the evidence 
of heavenly goodness, and love that she diffuses !" Is not 
such an art as this worth much to attain ? 

In training children to the Christian life, one very im- 
por.ant opportunity occurs whenever sickness appears in 
the family or neighborhood. The repression of disturbing 
noises, the speaking in tones of gentleness and sympathy, 
the small offices of service or nursing in which children 
can aid, should be inculcated as ministering to the Lord 
and Elder Brother of man, who has said, " Inasmuch as ye 
have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, 
ye have done it to me." 

One of the blessed opportunities for such ministries is 
given to children in the cultivation of flowers. The en-

trance into a sick-room of a smiling, liealtlif ul child, bring- 
ing an offering of flowers raised by its own labor, is like an 
angel of comfort and love, " and aKke it blesseth bim who 
gives and him who takes." 

A time is coming when the visitation of the sick, as a 
part of the Christian life, will hold a higher consideration 
than is now generally accorded, especially in the cases of 
uninteresting sufferers who have nothing to attract kind at- 
tentions, except that they are suffering childi-en of our 
Father in heaven, and " one of the least" of the brethren 
of Jesus Christ.

ACCIDENTS AISD ANTIDOTEa 

Ohildeen should be taught the following modes ol ja- 
vinglife, health and limbs in cases of sudden emergency^ be- 
fore a medical adviser can be summoned.. 

In case of a common, cut, bind the Hps of the woond 
together with a rag, and put on nothing else. If it is large, 
lay narrow strips of sticking-plaster obliquely across the 
wound. In some cases it is needful to draw a needle and 
thread through the lips of the woimd, and tie the two sides 
together. 

If an artery be cut, it must be tied as quickly as possible, 
or the person will soon bleed to death. The blood from an 
artery is a brighter red than that from the veins, and spirts 
out in jets at each beat of the heart. Take hold of the end 
of the artery and tie it or hold it tight till a surgeon comes. 
In this case, and in all cases of bad wounds that bleed 
much, tie a tight bandage near and above the wound, insert- 
ing a stick into the bandage and twisting as tight as can 
be 'borne, to stop the immediate effusion of blood. 

Bathe bad bruises in hot water. Arnica water hastens a 
cure, but is injurious and weakening to the parts when used 
too long and too freely. 

A sprain is relieved from the first pains by hot fomenta- 
tions, or the application of very hot bandages, but entire 
rest is the chief permanent remedy. The more the limb 
is used, especially at first, the longer the time required for 
the small broken fibres to knit together. The spraiaed 
leg should be kept in a horizontal position. When a leg is 



ACCIDENTS AJVD ANTIDOTES. 349 

broken, tie it to the other leg, to keep it ^till till a surgeon 
comes. _Tie a broken arm to a piece of thin wood, to keep 
it still till set. 

In the case of bad burns that take off the skin, creosote 
water is the best remedy. If this is not at hand, wood-soot 
(not coal) pounded, sifted, and mixed with lard i^ nearly as 
good, as such soot contains creosote. When a dressing is 
put on, do not remove it tiU a skin is formed under it. If 
nothing else is at hand for a bad burn, sprinkle flour oyer 
the place where the skin is off and then let it remain, pro- 
tected by a bandage. The chief aim is to keep the part 
without skin from the air. 

In case of drowning, the aim should be to clear the 
throat, mouth and nostrils, and then produce the natural 
action of the lungs in breathing as soon as possible, at the 
same time removing wet clothes and applying warmth and 
friction to the skin, especially the hands and feet, to start 
the circulation. The best mode of cleansing the throat and 
mouth of choking water is to lay the person on the face, and 
raise the head a little, clearing the mouth and nostrils with 
the finger, and then apply hartshorn or camphor to the 
nose. This is safer and surer than a common mode of lift- 
ing the body by the feet, or rolling on a barrel to empty 
out the water. 

To start the action of the lungs, first lay the person on 
the face and press the back along the spine to expel all air 
from the lungs. Then turn the body nearly, but not quite 
over on to the back, thus opening the chest so that the air 
wiU rush in if the mouth is kept open. Then turn the body 
to the face again and expel the air, and then again nearly 
over on to the back; and so continue for a long time. 
Friction, dry and warm clothing, and warm applications 
should be used in connection with this process. This is a 
much better mode than using bellows, which some- 
times win close the opening to the windpipe. The above 
is the mode recommended by Dr. Marshall Hall, and is ap- 
proved by the best medical authorities. 



350 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Certain articles are often kept in the house for cooking 
or medical purposes, and sometimes by mistake are taken 
in quantities that are poisonous. 

Soda, saleratus, potash, or any other alkali can be ren- 
dered harmless in the stomach by vinegar, tomato-juice, or 
any other acid. If sulphuric or oxalic acid are taken, 
pounded chalk in water is the best antidote. If those 
are not at hand, strong soapsuds have been found effect- 
ive. Large quantities of tepid water should be drank after 
these antidotes are taken, so as to produce vomiting. 

Lime or iaryta and its compounds demand a solution 
of glauber salts or of sulphuric acid. 

Iodine or Iodide of Potassium demands large draughts of 
wheat flour or starch in water, and then vinegar and water. 
The stomach should then be emptied by vomiting with as 
much tepid water as the stomach can hold. 

Prussia acid, a violent poison, is sometimes taken by 
children in eating the pits of stone fruits or bitter almonds 
which contain it. The antidote is to empty the stomach 
by an emetic, and give water of ammonia or chloric water. 
Affusions of cold water all over the body, followed by 
warm hand friction, is often a remedy alone, but the above 
should be added if at command. Antim,ony and its com- 
pounds demand drinks of oak bark, or gall nuts, or very 
strong green tea. 

Arsenic demands oil or melted fat, with magnesia or 
lime water in large quantities, till vomiting occurs. 

Corrosive Sublimate, (often used to kill vermin,) and any 
other form of mercury, requires milk or whites of eggs 
in large quantities. The whites of twelve eggs in two 
quarts of water, given in the largest possible draughts 
every three minutes till free vomiting occurs, is a good 
remedy. Flour and water will answer, though not so sure- 
ly as the above. "Warm water will help, if nothing else is 
in reach. The same remedy answers when any form of 
copper, or tin, or zinc poison is taken, and also for creosote 



ACCIDENTS AND ANTIDOTES. 351 

Zead and it8 compounds require a dilution of Epsom 
or Glauber salts, or some strong, acid drink, as lemon or 
tomatoes. 

JViirate of Silver demands salt water drank till vomiting 
occurs. 

Phosphorus (sometimes taken by cbildren from matcbes) 
needs magnesia and copious drinks of gum Arabic, or gum 
water of any sort. 

Alcohol, in dangerous quantities, demands vomiting 
with warm water. , ' 

When one is violently sick from excessive use of tohac- 
00, vomiting is a relief, if it arise spontaneously. After 
tbat, or in case it does not occur, tbe juice of a lemon and 
perfect rest, in a borizontal position on tbe back, will re- 
lieve tbe liausea and faintness, generally sootbing tbe fool- 
isb and over-wrougbt patient into a sleep. 

Opium demands a quick emetic. Tbe best is a beaping 
table-spoonful of powdered mustard, in a tumblerful of 
warm water ; or powdered alum in balf-onnce doses and 
strong coffee alternately in warm water. Give acid drinks 
after vomiting. If vomiting is not elicited tbus, a stom- 
acb pump is demanded. Dasb cold water on tbe bead, ap- 
ply friction, and use all means to keep tbe person awake 
and in motion. 

Strychnia demands also quick emetics. 

Tbe stomacb sbould be emptied always after taking any 
of tbese antidotes, by a warm water emetic. 

In case of bleeding at tbe lungs, or stomacb, or tbroat, 
give a tea-spoonful of dry salt, and repeat it often. For 
bleeding at tbe nose, put ice, or pour cold water on tbe 
back of tbe neck, keeping tbe bead elevated. 

If a person be struck witb ligbtning, tbrow pailfals of 
cold water on tbe bead and body, and apply mustard poul- 
tices on tbe stomacb, witb friction of tbe wbole body and 
inflation of tbe lungs, as in tbe case of drowning. Tbe 



352 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

same mode is to be used when persons are stupified by 
fumes of coal, or bad air. 

In thunderstorms, shut the doors and windows. The 
safest part of a room is its centre ; and where there is a 
feather-bed in the apartment, that will be found the most 
secure resting-place. 

A lightning-rod if it be well pointed, and run deep into 
the earth, is a certain protection to a circle around it, 
whose diameter equals the height of the rod above the 
highest chimney. But it protects nofa/rther than this ex- 
tent. 

In case of fire, wrap about you a blanket, a shawl, a 
piece of carpet, or any other woolen cloth, to serve as pro- 
tection. Never read in bed, lest you fall asleep, and the 
bed bo set on fire. If your clothes get on fire, never run, 
but lie down, and roll about till you can reach a bed or 
carpet to wrap yourself in, and thus put out the fire. Keep 
young childrei in woolen dresses, to save them from the 
risk of fire. 



XXYIII. 



EvEET young girl should be taught to do the following 
kinds of stitch with propriety : Over-stitch, hemming, 
running, felling, stitching, back-stitch and run, buttonhole- 
stitch, chain-stitch, whipping, darning, gathering, and 
cross-stitch. 

In doing over-stitch, the edges should always be first 
fitted, either with pins or basting, to prevent puckering. 
In turning wide hems, a paper measure should be used, to 
make them even. Tucks, also, should be regulated by a 
paper measure. A fell should be turned, before the edges 
are put together, and the seam should be over-sewed be- 
fore felling. All biased or goring seams should be felled. 
For stitching, draw a thread, and take up two or three 
threads at a stitch. 

In cutting buttonholes, it is best to have a pair of scis- 
sors, made for the purpose, which cut very neatly. For 
broadcloth, a chisel and board are better. The best stitch 
is made by putting in the needle, and then turning the 
thread round it near the eye. This is better than to draw 
the needle through, and then take up a loop. A stay 
thread should first be put across each side of the button- 
hole, and also a bar at each end before working it. In 
working the buttonhole, keep the stay thread as far from 
the edge as possible. A small bar should be worked at 
each end. 

Whipping is done better by sewing over, and not under. 
The roll should be as fine as possible, the stitches short. 



354 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

the thread strong, and in. sewing, every gather should be 
taken up. 

The rule for gathering in shirts is, to draw a thread, 
and then take up two threads and skip four. In darning, 
after the perpendicular threads are run, the crossing 
threads should interlace exactly, taking one thread and 
leaving one, like woven threads. It is better to run a iine 
thread around a hole and draw it together, and then darn 
across it. 

The neatest sewers always fit and baste their work be- 
fore sewing ; and they say they always save time in the 
end by so doing, as they never have to pick out work on 
account of mistakes. 

It is wise to sew closely and tightly all new garments 
which will never be altered in shape; but some are 
more nice than wise, in sewing frocks and old garments in 
the same style. However, this is the least common ex- 
treme. It is much more frequently the case that articles 
which ought to be strongly and neatly made are sewed so 
that a nice sewer would rather pick out the threads and 
sew over again than to be annoyed with the sight of grin- 
ning stitches, and vexed- with constant rips. 

If the thread kinks in sewing, break it off and begin at 
the other end. In using spool-cotton, thread the needle 
with the end which comes off first, and not the end vhere 
you break it off. This often prevents kinks. 

Wm'li-baskets. — It is very important to neatness, comfort, 
and success in sewing, that a lady's work-basket should 
be properly fitted up. The following articles are needful 
to the mistress of a family : a large basket to hold work ; 
having in it fastened a smaller basket or box, containing a 
needle-book in which are needles of every size, both blunts 
and sharps with a larger number of those sizes most used ; 
also small and large darning-needles, for woolen, cotton, 
and silk ; two tape needles, large and small ; nice scissors 
for fine work, button-hole scissors ; an emery bag ; two balls 



SEWINO, CUTTING, AND MMNDIN&. 355 

of white and yellow wax ; and two thimbles, in case one 
should be mislaid. When a person is troubled with damp 
fingers, a lump pf soft chalk in a paper is useful to rub on 
the ends of the fingers. 

Besides this box, keep in the basket common scissors ; 
small shears ; a bag containing tapes of all colors and sizes, 
done up in rolls ; bags, one containing spools of white and an- 
other of colored cotton thread, and another for silks wound 
on spools or papers ; a box or bag for nice buttons, and 
•another for more common ones ; a bag containing silk braid, 
welting, cords, and galloon binding. Small rolls of pieces 
of white and brown linen and cotton are also often need- 
ed. A brick pin-cushion is a great conyenience in sewing, 
and better than screw cushions. It is made by covering 
half a brick with cloth, putting a cushion on the top, and 
covering it tastefully. It is very useful to hold pins and 
needles while sewing, and to fasten long seams when bas- 
ting and sewing. 

To make a Frock. — The best way for a novice is to get a 
dress fitted (not sewed) at the best mantua-maker's. Then 
take out a sleeve, rip it to pieces, and cut out a paper pattern. 
Then take out half of the waist, (it must have a seam in 
fi^ont,) and cut out a pattern of the back and fore-body, both 
lining and outer part. In cutting the patterns, iron 
the pieces smooth, let the paper be stiff, and with a pin 
prick holes in the paper, to show the gore in front and the 
depths of the seams. "With a pen and ink, draw lines 
from each pin-hole to preserve this mark. Then baste the 
parts together again, in doing which the unbasted half will 
serve as a pattern. When this is done, a lady of common 
ingenuity can cut and fit a dress by these patterns. If the 
waist of a dress be too tight, the seam under the arm must 
be let out ; and in cutting a dress an allowance should be 
made for letting it out if needful, at this seam. 

The linings for the waists of dresses should be stiffened 
with cotton or linen. In cutting bias-pieces for trimming, 



356 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

they will not set well unless they are exact. In cutting tliem, 
use a long rule, and a lead pencil or piece of chalk. Welt- 
ing-cords should be covered with bias-pieces ; and it saves 
time, in many cases, to baste on the welting-cord at the 
same time that you cover it. The best way to put on 
hooks and eyes is to sew them on double broad tape, and 
sew this on the frock lining. They can be moved easily, 
and do not show where they are sewed on. 

In putting on linings of skirts at the bottom, be careful 
to have it a very little fuller than the dress, or it will shrink 
and look badly. All thin silks look much better with 
lining, and last much longer, as do aprons also. In putting 
a lining to a dress, baste it on each separate breadth, and 
sew it at the seams, and it looks much better than to have 
it fastened only at the bottom. Make notches in selvedge, 
to prevent it from drawing up the breadth. Dresses 
which are to be washed should not be lined. 

Figured silks do not generally wear well if the figure be 
large and satin-like. Black and plain-colored silks can be 
tested by procuring samples, and making creases in them ; 
fold the creases in a bunch, and rub them against a rough 
surface of moreen or carpeting. Those which are poor 
will soon wear off at the creases. 

Plaids look, becoming for tall women, as they shorten 
the appearance of the figure. Stripes look becoming on a 
large person, as they reduce the apparent size. Pale per- 
sons should not wear blue or green, and brunettes should 
not wear light delicate colors, except shades of buff, fawn, 
or straw color. Pearl white is not good for any complex- 
ion. Dead white a^d black look becoming on almost all 
persons. It is best to try colors by candle-light for evening 
dresses, as some colors which look very handsome in the 
dayHght are very homely when seen by candle-light. 
Never be in haste to be first in a fashion, and never go to 
the extremes. 

Linen and Ootton. — In buying linen, seek for that which 



SEWmG, CUTTING, AND MENDING. 357 

has a round close thread and is perfectly white ; for if it 
be not white at first, it will never afterward become so. 
Much that is called linen at the shops is half cotton, and 
does not wear so well as cotton alone. Cheap linens are 
usually of this kind. It is difficult to discover which are 
aU linen ; but the best way is to find a lot presumed to be 
good, take a sample, wash it, and ravel it. If this be good, 
the rest of the same lot will probably be so. If you can 
not do this, draw a thread each way, and , if both appear 
equally strong it is probably all linen. Linen and cotton 
must be put in clean water, and boiled, to get out the 
starch, and then ironed. 

A " long piece " of linen, a yard wide, will, with care and 
calculation, make eight shirts. In cutting it, take a shirt 
of the right size as a guide in fitting and basting. Bosom- 
pieces and false collars must be cut and fitted by patterns 
which suit the person for whom the articles are designed. 
Gentlemen's night-shirts are made like other shirts, except 
that they are longer, and do not have bosoms and cuffs 
for starching. 

In cutting chemises, if the cotton or linen is a yard 
wide, cut off small half-gores at the top of the breadths 
and set them on the bottom. Use a long rule and 
a pencil in cutting gores. In cutting cotton which is 
quite wide, a seam can be saved by cutting out two at once, 
in this manner : cut off three breadths, and with a long 
rule and a pencil, mark and cut off the gores ; thus from 
one breadth cut off two gores the whole length, each gore 
one fourth of the breadth at the bottom, and tapering off 
to a point at the top. The other two breadths are to 
have a gore cut off jfrom each, which is one fourth wide at 
the top and two fourths at bottom. Arrange these pieces 
right and they will make two chemises, one having four 
seams and the other three. This is a much easier way of 
cutting than sewing the three breadths together in bag 
fashion, as is often done. The biased or goring seams 



358 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

must always be felled. The sleeves and neck can be cut 
according to the taste of the wearer, by another chemise 
for a pattern. There should be a lining around the arm- 
holes and stays at all corners. Six yards of yard width 
will make two chemises. 

Long night-gowns are best cut a little goring. It re- 
quires five yards for a long night-gown, and two and a 
half for a short one. Linen night caps wear longer than 
cotton ones, and do not like them turn yellow. They 
should be ruffled with linen, as cotton borders will not 
last so long as the cap. A double-quilted wrapper is a 
great comfort, in case of sickness. It may be made of 
two old dresses. It should not be cut full, but rather like 
a gentleman's study-gown, having no gathers or plaits, but 
large enough to slip off and on with ease. A double-gown 
of calico is also very useful. Most articles of dress, for 
grown persons or children, require patterns. 

Old silk dresses quilted for skirts are very serviceable. 
White flannel is soiled so easily and shrinks so much in wash- 
ing that it is a good plan to color it. Cotton flannel is also 
good for common skirts. In making up flannel, back-stitch 
and run the seams and then cross-stitch them open. Nice 
flannel for infants can be ornamented with very little 
expense of time, by turning up the hem on the right side, 
and making a little vine at the edge with saddler's silk. 
The stitch of the vine is a modification of button-hole stitch. 

Mending. Silk dresses will last much longer, by ripping 
out the sleeves when thin, and changing the arms and also 
the breadths of the skirt. Tumbled black silk, which is 
old and rusty, should be dipped in water, then be drained 
for a few minutes, without squeezing or pressing, and then 
ironed. Coffee or cold tea is better than water. Sheets 
when worn thin in the middle should be ripped, and the 
other edges sewed together. "Window-curtains last much 
longer if lined, as the sun fades and rots them. 

Broadcloth should be cut with reference to the way the 



SEWING, CUTTING, AND MENDING. 359 

nap rims. When pantaloons are thin, it is best to newly 
-seat them, cutting the piece inserted in a curve, as corners 
are difficult to fit. Hose can be cut down when the feet 
are worn. Take an old stocking and cut it up for a pat- 
tern. Make the heel short. In sewing, turn each edge 
and run it down, and then sew over the edges. This is 
better than to stitch and then cross-stitch. " Eun " thin 
places in stockings, and it will save darning a hole. If 
shoes are worn through on the sides, ia the upper-lealher, 
slip pieces of broadcloth under, and sew them around the 
holes. 

Bedding. The best beds are thick hair mattresses, 
which for persons in health are good for winter as well as 
summer use. Mattresses may also be made of husks, dried 
and drawn into shreds ; also of alternate layers of cotton 
and moss. The most profitable sheeting is the Russian, 
which wiU last three times as long as any other. It is 
never perfectly white. Unbleached cotton is good for win- 
ter. It is poor economy to make narrow and short sheets, 
as children and domestics will always slip them ofi", and 
soil the bed-tick and bolster. They should be three yards 
long, and two and a half wide, so that they can be tucked 
in all around'. All bed-linen should be marked and num- 
bered, so that a bed can always be made properly, and all 
missing articles be known.

FIEES AND LIGHTS. 



A. SHALLOW fireplace saTes wood and gives out more lieat 
tlian a deeper one. A false back of brick may be put up 
in a deep fireplace. Hooks for holding up the shovel and 
tongs, a hearth-brush and bellows, and brass knobs to hang 
them on, should be furnished to every fireplace. An iron 
bar across the andirons aids in keeping the fire safe and in 
good order. Steel furniture is neater, handsomer, and 
more easily kept in order than that made of brass. 

Use green wood for logs, and mix green and dry wood 
for the fire ; and then the wood-pile will last much longer. 
"Walnut, maple; hickory, and oak wood are best ; chestnut 
or hemlock is bad, because it snaps. Do not buy a load in 
which there are many crooked sticks. Learn how to mea- 
sure and calculate the solid contents of a load, so as not to 
be cheated. A cord of wood should be equivalent to a pile 
eight feet long, four feet wide and four feet high ; that ie, 
it contains (8x4x4=128) one hundred and twenty-eight 
cubic or solid feet. A city " load " is usually one third of 
a cord. Have all your wood split and piled under 
cover for winter. Have the green wood logs in one pile, 
dry wood in another, oven- wood in another, kindlings and 
chips in another, and a supply of charcoal to use for broil- 
ing and ironing in another place. Have a brick bin for 
ashes, and never allow them to be put in wood. When 
quitting fires at night, never leave a burning stick across 
the andirons, nor on its end, without quenching it. See 
that no fire adheres to the broom or brush, remove aU arti- 



IJRES AND LIGMTS. 361 

cles from the fire, and have two pails filled with water in 
the kitchen where they will not freeze. 

STOVES AND GBATBS. 

Kooms heated by stoves should always have some open- 
ing for the admission of fresh air, or they will be injurious 
to health. The dryness of the air, which they occasion, 
should be remedied by placing a vessel fiUed with water 
on the stove, otherwise, the lungs or eyes will be injured. 
A large number of plants in a room prevents this dryness 
of the air. Where stove-pipes pass through fire-boards, the 
hole in the wood should be much larger than the pipe, so 
that there may be no danger of the wood taking fire. The 
unsightly opening thus occasioned should be covered with 
tin. When pipes are carried through floors or partitions, 
they should always pass either through earthen crocks, 
or what are known as tin stove-pipe thimbles, which may 
be found in any stove store or tinsmith's. Lengthening a 
pipe wiU increase its draught. 

For those who use cmthracite coal, that which is broken 
or screened is best for grates, and the nut-coal for small 
stoves. Three tons are sufficient in the Middle States, and 
four tons in the Northern, to keep one fire through the 
winter. That which is bright, hard, and clean is best ; 
and that which is soft, porous, and covered with damp dust 
is poor. It wiU be well to provide two barrels of charcoal 
for kindling to every ton of anthracite coal. Grrates for 
hituminous coal should have a flue nearly as deep as the 
grate ; and the bars should be round and not close togeth- 
er. The better draught there is, the less coal-dust is made. 
Every grate should be furnished with a poker, shovel, 
tongs, blower, coal-scuttle, and holder for the blower. The 
latter may be made of woolen, covered with old silk, and 
hung near the fire. 

Ooal-stoves should be carefully put up, as cracks in the 
pipe, especially in sleeping rooms, are dangerous. 



362 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

LIGHTS. 

Professor Phin, of the Mcmufacim'er and Builder, has 
kindly given us some late information on this important 
topic, which will be found valuable. 

In choosing the source of our light, the great points to be 
considered are, first, the influence on the eyes, and second- 
ly, economy. It is poor economy to use a bad Kght. 
Modern houses in cities, and even in large villages, are 
furnished with gas ; where gas is not used, sperm-oil, kero- 
sene or coal-oil, and candles are employed. Gas is the 
cheapest, (or ought to be ;) and if properly used, is as good 
as any. Good sperm-oil burned in an Argand lamp — that is, 
a lamp with a circular wick, like the astral lamp and 
others — is perhaps the best ; but it is expensive and attend- 
ed with many inconveniences. Good kerosene oil gives a 
light which leaves little to be desired. Candles are used 
only on rare occasions, though many families prefer to 
manufacture into candles the waste grease that accumu- 
lates in the household. The economy of any source of 
light will depend so much upon local circumstances that 
no absolute directions can be given. 

The effect produced by light on the eyes depends upon 
the following points : First, Steadiness. Nothing is 
more injurious to the eyes than a flickering, unsteady 
flame.' Hence, all flames used for light-giving purposes 
ought to be surrounded with glass chimneys or small 
shades. I^o naked flame can ever be steady. Second, 
Color. This depends greatly upon the temperature of the 
flame. A hot flame gives a bright, white light ; a flame 
which has not a high temperature gives a dull, yeUow 
light, which is very injurious to the eyes. In the naked 
gas-jet a large portion of the flame burns at a low tempe- 
rature, and the same is the case with the flame of the kero 
sene lamp when the height of the chimney is not properly 
proportioned to the amount of oil consumed ; a high wick 
needs a high chimney. In the case of a well-trimmed Ar 



FIRES AND LI6BTS. 363 

gand oil-lamp, or an Argand burner for gas, the flame is 
in general, most intensely hot, and the light is of a clear 
white character. 

The third point which demands attention is the amovMt 
of heat transmitted from the flame to the eyes. It often 
happens that people, in order to economize light, bring the 
lamp quite plose to the face. This is a very bad habit. 
The heat is more injurious than the light. Better burn a 
larger flaine, and keep it at a greater distance. 

It is also well that various sized lamps should be pro- 
vided to serve the varying necessities of the household in 
regard to quantity of light. One of the very best forms 
of lamp is that known as the " student's reading-lamp," 
which is, in the burner, an Argand. Provide small lamps 
with handles for carrying abouj;, and broad-bottomed lamps 
for the kitchen, as theBe are not easily upset. Hand and 
•kitchen lamps are' best made of metal, unless they are to 
be used by very careful persons. 

Sperm-oil, lard, tallow, etc., have been superseded to 
such an extent by kerosene that it is scarcely worth while 
to give any special directions in regard to them. In the 
choice of kerosene, attention should be paid to two pbints : 
its safety and its light-giving qualities. Kerosene is not a 
simplle fluid, like water ; but is a mixture of several 
liquids, all of which boil at different temperatures. Good 
kerosene oil should be purifled from all that portion which 
boils or evaporates at a low temperature ; for it is the 
production of this vapor, and its mixture with atmospheric 
air, that gives rise to those terrible explosions which some- 
times occur when a light is brought near a can of poor oil. 
To test the oil in this respect, pour a little into an iron 
spoon, and heat it over a lamp until it is moderately warm 
to the touch. If the oil produces vapor which can be set 
on fire by means of a flame held a short distance above the 
surface of the liquid, it is bad. Good oil poured into a 
teacup or on the floor does not easily take fire when a 



364 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL 

light is brought in contact with it. Poor oil will instantly 
ignite under the same circumstances, and hence, the 
breaking of a lamp filled with poor oil is always attended 
by great peril of a conflagration. Not only the safety but 
also the light-giving qualities of kerosene are greatly en- 
hanced by the removal of these volatile and dangerous oils. 
Hence, while good kerosene should be clear in color and 
free from all matters which can gum up the wick and thus 
interfere with free circulation and combustion, it should 
also be perfectly safe. It ought to be kept in a cool, dark 
place, and carefully excluded from the air. 

The care, of lamps requires so much attention and discre- 
tion, that many ladieB choose to do this work themselves, 
rather than trust it with domestics. To do it properly, 
provide the following things : an old waiter to hold all the 
articles used ; a lamp-filler, with a spotitj small at the end, 
and tm'ned up to prevent oil from dripping ; proper wicks, 
and a basket or box to hold them ; a lamp-trimmer made 
for the purpose, or a pair of sharp scissors ; a small soap- 
cup and soap ; some washing soda in a broad-mouthed 
bottle; and several soft cloths to wash the articles and 
towels to wipe them. If every thing, after being used, is 
cleansed from oil and then kept neatly, it will not be so 
unpleasant a task as it usually is, to take care of lamps. 

The inside of lamps and oil-cans should be cleansed with 
soda dissolved in water. Be careful to drain them well, 
and not to let any gilding or bronze be injured by the 
soda coming in contact with it. Put one table-spoonful 
of soda to one quart of "water. Take the lamp to pieces 
and clean it as often as necessary. Wipe the chimney at 
least once a day, and wash it whenever mere wiping fails to 
cleanse it. Some persons, owing to the dirty state of their 
chimneys, lose half the light which is produced. Keep dry 
fingers in trimming lamps. Kcnew the wicks before they 
get too short. They should never be allowed to burn 
shorter than an inch and a half. 



MBES AND LIGHTS. 365 

In regard to shades, which are always well to use, od 
lamps or gas, those made of glass or porcelain are now so 
cheap that we can recommend them as the best without 
any reservation. Plain shades, making the light soft and 
even, do not injure the eyes. Lamps should be lighted 
with a strip of folded or rolled paper, of which a quantity 
sliould be kept on the mantelpiece. "Weak eyes should 
always be especially shaded from the lights. Small 
screens, made for the purpose, should be kept at hand. A 
person with weak eyes can use them safely much longer 
when they are protected from the glare of the light. Fill 
the entry-lamp every day, and cleanse and fill night-lan- 
terns twice a week, if used often. A good night-lamp is 
made with a small one- wicked lamp and a roll of tin to 
set over it. Have some holes made in the bottom of this 
cover, and it can then be used to heat articles. Yery 
cheap floating tapers can be bought to burn in a teacup 
of oil through the night. 

TO MASE CAI7DLES. 

The nicest candles are those run in moulds. For this 
purpose, -melt together one quarter of a pound of white 
wax, one quarter of an ounce of camphor, two ounces of 
alum, and ten ounces of suet or mutton-tallow. Soak the 
wicks in lime-water and saltpetre, and when dry, fix them 
iu the moulds and pour in the melted tallow. Let them 
remain one night to cool ; then warm them a little to loos- 
en them, draw them out, and when they are hard, put them 
in a box ia a dry and cool place. 

To make dipped candles, cut the wicks of the right 
length, double them over rods, and twist them. They 
should first be dipped in lime-water or vinegar, and dried. 
Melt the tallow ia a large kettle, filling it to the top with 
hot water, when the tallow is melted. Put in wax and 
powdered alum, to harden them. Keep the tallow hot 



366 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

over a portable fiirnace, and fill the kettle with hot watei 
as fast as the tallow is used up. Lay two long strips of 
narrow board on which to hang the rods ; and set flat pans 
under, on the floor, to catch the grease. Take several rods 
at once, and wet the wicks in the tallow ; straighten and 
smooth them when cool. Then dip them as fast as they 
cool, until they become of the proper size. Plunge ihem 
obliquely and not perpendicularly ; and when the bottoms 
are too large, hold them in the hot grease till a part melts 
off Let them remain one night to cool ; then cut off the 
bottoms, and keep them in a dry, cool place. Cheap lights 
are made, by dipping rushes in tallow ; the rushes being 
first stripped of nearly the whole of the hard outer cover- 
ing and the pith alone being retained with just enough of 
the tough bark to keep it stiff. 



THE OABE OF KOOMB. 

It would be impossible in a work dealing, as this does 
with general principles of house-keeping, to elaborate in 
full the multitudinous details which arise for attention and 
intelligent care. These will be more largely treated of in 
the book soon to be published for the present writer, (the 
senior authoress of this volume.) Yet, in the different 
departments of family labor, there are certain leading 
matters concerning which & few hints may be found useful 
in aiding the reader to carry into operation the instruc- 
tions and ideas of the earlier chapters of this book, and in 
promoting the general comfort and conrenience of fami- 
lies. 

And first, asking the reader to bear in mind that these 
suggestions are chiefly applicable to country homes, not 
within easy reach of all the conveniences which go under 
the name of " modern improvements," we will say a few 
words on the care of Parlors. 

In hanging pictures, put them so that the lower part 
shall be opposite the eye. Cleanse the glass of pictures 
with whiting, as water endangers the pictures. Gilt 
frames can be much better preserved by putting on a coat 
of copal varnish^ which with proper brushes, can be bought 
of carriage or cabinet-makers. When dry, it can be 
washed with fair water. Wash the brush in spirits of tur- 
pentine. 

Curtains, ottomans, and sofas covered with worsted, can be 
cleansed with wheat bran, rubbed on with flannel. Shadee 



368 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

of linen or cotton, on rollers and pulleys, are always useful 
to shut out the sun from curtains and carpets. Paper cur 
tains, pasted on old cotton, are good for chambers. Put 
them on rollers, having cords nailed to them, so that when 
the curtain falls, the cord will be wound up. Then, by 
pulling the cord, the curtain 's^'ll be rolled up. 

Yarnished furniture should be rubbed only with silk, ex- 
cept occasionally, when a little sweet-oil should be rubbed 
over, and wiped off carefully. For unvarnished furniture, 
use bees-wax, a little softened with sweet-oil ; rub it in with 
a hard brush, and polish with woolen and silk rags. Some 
persons rub in linseed-oil ; others mix bees-wax with a little 
spirits of turpentine and rosin, making it so that it can be 
put on with a sponge, and wiped off with a soft rag. Oth- 
ers keep in a bottle the following mixtm-e : two ounces of 
spirits of turpentine, four table-spoonfuls of sweet-oil, and 
one quart of milk. This is applied with a sponge, and 
wiped off with a linen rag. 

Hearths and jambs, of brick, look best painted over with 
black lead, mixedwith soft-soap. "Wash the bricks which 
are nearest the fire- with redding and milk, using a painter's 
brush. A sheet of zinc, covering the whole hearth, is 
cheap, saves work, and looks very well. A tinman can fit 
it properly. 

, Stone hearths should be rubbed with a paste of powdered 
stone, (to be procured of the stone-cutters,) and then brushed 
with a stiff brush. Kitchen hearths, of stpne, are improved 
by rubbing in lamp-oil. 

Stains can be removed from marble, by oxalic acid and 
water, or oil of vitriol and water, left on a few minutes, 
and then rubbed dry. Gray marble is improved by lin- 
seed-oil. Grease can be taken from marble, by ox-gall and 
potter's clay wet with soapsuds, (a gill of each.) It is bet- 
ter to add, also, a gill of spirit's of turpentine. It improves 
the looks of marble, to cover it with this mixture, leaving 
it two days, and then rubbing it off. 



THE CARE OF ROOMS. 369 

Unless a parlor is in constant use, it is best to sweep it 
only once a week, and at other times use a whisk-broom 
and dust-pan. When a parlor with handsome furniture 
is to be swept, cover the sofas, centre table, piano, books, 
and mantelpiece with old cottons kept for the purpose. 
Remove the rugs and shake them, and clean the jambs, 
hearth, and fire-farniture. Then sweep the room, moving 
every article. Dust the furniture with a dust-brush and a 
piece of old silk. A painter's brush should be kept, to re- 
move dust from ledges and crevices. The dust-cloths 
should be often shaken and washed, or else they wUl soil 
the walls and fiirniture when they are used. Dust orna- 
ments and fine books with feather brushes, used for no 
other purpose. 

Chambers and Bedrooms are of course a portion of the 
house to be sedulously and scrupulously attended to, if 
either health or comfort are aimed at in the family. And 
first, every mistress of a family should see, not only that 
all sleeping-rooms in her house can be well ventilated at 
night, but that they actually are so. Where there is no 
provision made for the introduction of pure air, in the con- 
struction of the house, and in the bedroom itself no open 
fire-place to allow the easy exit of foul air, a door should 
be left open into an entry or room where fresh air is 
admitted; or else a small opening should be made in a 
window, taking care not to allow a draught of air to cross 
the bed. The debility of childhood, the lassitude of domes- 
tics, and the ill-health of families, are often caused by ne- 
glecting to provide a supply of pure air. 

It is not deemed necessary to add much to the earlier 
chapters treating of bedroom conveniences ; but one sub- 
ject is of marked importance, as being characteristic of 
good or poor housekeeping — that is, the making of beds. 

Few servants will make a bed properly, without much 
attention from the mistress of the family*; and every young 
woman who expects to have a household of her own tc 



370 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

manage should be able to do it well herself, and to instruct 
others in doing it. The following directions should be 
given to those who do this work : 

Open the windows, and lay off the bed-covering on two 
chairs, at the foot of the bed. If it be a feather-bed, after 
it is well aired, shake the feathers from each corner to the 
middle ; then take up the middle, shake it well, and turn 
the bed over. Then push the feathers in place, 'making 
the heai^d higher than the foot, and the sides even, and as 
high as the middle part. A mattress, whether used on top 
of a feather- bed or by itself, should in like manner be well 
aired and turned. Then put on the bolster and the under 
sheet, so that the wrong side of the sheet shall go next the 
bed, and the marJcing always come at the head, tucking in 
all around. Then put on the pillows, evenly, so that the ' 
open ends shall come to the sides of the bed, and spread 
on the upper sheet so that the wrong side shall be next 
the blankets, and the marked end always at the head. 
This arrangement of sheets is to prevent the part where 
the feet lie from being reversed, so as to come to the face ; 
and also to prevent the parts soiled by the body from com- 
ing to the bedtick and blankets. Put on the other cover- 
ing, except the outer one, tucking in all around, and then 
turn over the upper sheet at the head, so as to show a part 
of the pillows. When the pillow-cases are clean and 
smooth, they look best outside of the cover, but not other- 
wise. Then draw the hand along the side of the pillows, 
to make an even indentation, and then smooth and shape 
the whole outside. A nice housekeeper always notices the 
manner in which a bed is made ; and in some parts of the 
country, it is rare to see this work properly performed. 

The wi-iter would here urge every mistress of a family, 
who keeps more than one domestic servant, to provide 
them with single beds, that they might not be obliged to 
sleep with aU the changing domestics, who come and go 
so often. Where the room is too small for two beds, a nar- 



TJSE CABB OF ROOMS. 371 

row truckle-bed kept under anotlier during the day will 
answer. Domestics should be furnisbed with washing 
conveniences in their chambers, and be encouraged to keep 
their persons and rooms neat and in order. 

The care of the Kitchen, Cellar, and Storeroom is necessa- 
r'ly the foundation of all proper housekeeping. 

If parents wish their daughters to grow up with good 
domestic habits, they should have, as one means of secur- 
ing this result, a neat and cheerful kitchen. A kitchen 
"should always, if possible, be entirely above-ground, and 
well lighted. It should have a large sink, with a drain 
running under-ground, so that all the premises may be 
kept sweet and clean. If iiowers and shrubs be cultivated 
around the doors and windows, and the yard near them 
be kept well turfed, it will add very much to their agreeable 
appearance. The walls should often be cleaned and white- 
washed, to promote a neat look and pure air. The floor 
of a kitchen should be painted, or, what is better, covered 
with an oilcloth. To procure a kitchen oilcloth as cheaply 
as possible, buy cheap tow cloth, and fit it to the size and 
shape of the kitchen. Then have it stretched, and nailed 
to the south side of the bam, and, with a brush, cover it 
with a coat of thin rye paste. When this is dry, put on a 
coat of yellow paint, and let it dry for a fortnight. It is 
safest to first try the paint, and see if it dries well, as some 
paint never will dry. Then put on a second coat, and at 
the end of .another fortnight, a third coat. Then let it 
hang two months, and it will last, uninjured, for many 
years. The longer the paint is left to dry, the better. If 
varnished, it will last much longer. 

A sink should be scalded out every^ day, and occasionally 
with hot lye. On nails, over the sink, should be hung 
three good dish-cloths, hemmed, and furnished with loops ; 
one for dishes not greasy, one for greasy dishes, and one 
for washing greasy pots and kettles. These should be put 
in the wash every week. The lady who insists upon this 



372 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

will not be annoyed by kaving her disbes wasbed with 
dark, musty and greasy rags, as is too frequently the case. 
Under tbe sink sbould be kept a slop-pail ; and, on a 
sbelf by it, a soap-dish and two water-pails. A large boiler 
of warm soft water should always be kept over the fire, 
well covered, and a hearth-broom and bellows be hung 
Qear the fire. A clock is a very important article in the 
kitchen, in order to secure regularity at meals. 

WASHING DISHES. 

'No item of domestic labor iS so frequently done in a 
negligent manner, by domestics, as this. A full siipply of 
conveniences will do much toward the remedy of this evil. 
A swab, made of strips of linen tied to a stick, is useful 
to wash nice dishes, especially small, deep articles. Two 
or three towels, and three dish-cloths should be used. Two 
large tin tubs, painted on the outside, should be provided ; 
one for washing, and one for rinsing; also, a large old 
waiter, on which to drain the dishes. A soap-dish, with 
hard soap, and a fork, with which to use it, a slop-pail, and 
two pails for water, should also be furnished. The follow- 
ing rules for washing dishes will aid in promoting the de- 
sired care and neatness : 

1. Scrape the dishes, putting away any food which may 
remain on them, and which it may be proper to save for 
future use. Put grease into the grease-pot, and whatever 
else may be on the plates into the slop-pail. Save tea- 
leaves for sweeping. Set all the dishes, when scraped, in 
regular piles, the smallest at the top. 

2. Put the nicest articles in the wash-dish, and wash 
them in hot suds with the swab or nicest dish-cloth. 
Wipe all metal articles as soon as they are washed. Put 
all the rest into the rinsing-dish, which should be filled with 
hot water. When they are taken out, lay them to drain 
on the waiter. Then rinse the dish-cloth, and hang it up 
wipe the articles washed, and put them in their places.' 



THE CASH OF BOOMS. 373 

3. Pour in more hot water, wash the greasy dislies with 
the dish-cloth made for them, rinse them, and set them to 
drain. Wipe them, and set them away. "Wash the knives 
and forks, being cwreful that the handles are never put in wa- 
ter; wipe them, and then lay them in a knife-dish, to be 
scoured. 

4. Take a fresh supply of clean suds, 'in which wash 
the milk-pans, buckets, and tins. Then rinse and hang up 
this dish-cloth, and take the other, with which, wash the 
roaster, gridiron, pots, and kettles. Then wash and rinse 
the dish-cloth, and hang it up. Empty the slop-bucket, 
and scald it. Dry metal teapots and tins before the. fire. 
Then put the fire-place in order, and sweep and dust the 
kitchen. 

Some persons keep a deep and narrow vessel, in which 
to wash knives with a swab, so that a careless servant can 
not lay them ia the water while washing them. This arti- 
cle can be carried into the eating-room, to receive the 
knives and forks when they are taken from the table. 



KITCHEN FUENITUBE. 



Grochery. — Brown earthen pans are said to be best for 
milk and for cooking. Tin pans are lighter, and more con- 
venient, but are too cold for many pm-posfis. Tall earthen 
jars, with covers, are good to hold butter, salt, lard, etc. 
Acids should never be put into the red earthen ware, as 
there is a poisonous ingredient in the glazing which the 
acid takes off. Stone ware is better and stronger, and 
safer every way than any other kind. 

Iron Ware. — ^Many kitchens are very imperfectly supplied 
with the requisite conveniences for cooking. When a per- 
son has sufficient means, the following articles are all de- 
sirable : A nest of iron pots, of different sizes, (they should 
be slowly heated when new,) a long iron fork, to take out 
articles from boiling water ; an iron hook, with a handle, to 
lift pots from the crane ; a large and small gridiron, witl* 



374 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

grooved bars, and a trench to eatcli the grease ; a Dutch 
oven, called also a bake-pan ; two skillets, of different sizes, 
and a spider, or flat skillet, for frying; a griddle, a waffle- 
iron, tin and iron bake and bread pans ; two ladles, of dif- 
ferent sizes ; a skimmer ; iron skewers ; a toasting-iron ; 
two teakettles, one small and one large one ; two brass ket- 
tles, o'f different sizes, for soap-boiling, etc. Iron kettles, 
lined with porcelain, are better for preserves. The German 
are the best. Too hot a fire will crack them, but with 
care in this respect, they will last for many years. 

Portable charcoal furnaces, of iron or clay, are very 
useful in summer, in washing, ironing, and stewing, or 
making preserves. If used in the house, a strong draught 
must be made, to prevent the deleterious effects of the 
charcoal. A box and mill, for spice, pepper, and coffee, 
are needful to those who use these articles. Strong knives 
and forks, a sharp carving-knife, an iron cleaver and board, 
a fine saw, steelyards, chopping-tray and knife, an apple- 
parer, steel for sharpening knives, sugar-nippers, a dozen 
iron spoons, also a large iron one with a long handle, six 
or eight flat-irons, one of them very small, two iron-stands, 
a ruffle-iron, a crimping-iron, are also desirable. 

Tin Ware. — Bread-pans ; large and small patty-pans ; 
cake-pans, with a centre tube to insure their baking well ; 
pie-dishes, (of block-tin ;) a covered butter-kettle ; covered 
kettles to hold berries ; two sauce-pans ; a large oil-can ; 
(with a cock ;) a lamp-filler ; a lantern ; broad bottomed 
candlesticks for the kitchen ; a candle-box ; a funnel ; a 
reflector for baking warm cakes ; an oven or tin-kitchen ; 
an apple-corer ; an apple-roaster ; an egg-boiler ; two su- 
gar-scoops, and flour and meal-scoop ; a set of mugs ; 
three dippers ; a pint, quart, and gallon measure ; a set of 
scales and weights ; three or four pails, painted on the out- 
side ; a slop-bucket with a tight cover, painted on the out- 
side ; a milk-strainer ; a gravy -strainer ; a colander ; a dredg- 
ing-box ; a pepper-box ; a large and small grater ; a cheese-

box ; also a large box for cake, and a still larger one for 
bread, with tight covers. Bread, cake, and cheese, shut 
up in this way, will not grow dry as in the open air. 

Wooden Ware. — A nest of tubs; a set of pails and' 
bowls ; a large and small sieve ; a beetle for mashing po- 
tatoes ; a spade or stick for stirring butter and sugar ; a 
bread-board, for -moulding bread and making pie-crust ; a 
coffee-stick ; a clothes- stick ; a mush-stick ; a meat-beetle, 
to pound tough meat ; an egg-beater ; a ladle, for working 
butter J a bread-trough, (for a large family ;) flour-buckets, 
with lids, to hold sifted flour and Indian meal ; salt-boxes ; 
sugar-boxes ; starch and indigo-boxes ; spice-boxes ; a bo- 
som-board; a skirt-board ; a large ironing-board; two or 
three clothes-frames ; and six dozen clothes-pins. 

Basket Ware. — Baskets of all sizes, for eggs, fruit, mar- 
keting, clothes, etc. ; also chip-baskets. "When often used, 
they should be washed in hot suds. 

Other Articles. — Every kitchen needs a box containing 
balls of brown thread and twine, a large and small darn- 
ing needle, rolls of waste paper and old linen and cotton, 
and a supply of common holders. There should also be 
another box, containing a hammer, carpet-tacks, and nails 
of all fiizes, a carpet-claw, screws and a screw-driver, pin- 
cers, gimlets of several sizes, a bed-screw, a small saw, two 
chisels, (one to use for button-holes in broadcloth,) two 
awls and two files. 

In a drawer or cupboard should be placed cotton table- 
cloths for kitchen use; nice crash towels for tumblers, 
' marked T T ; coarser towels for dishes map"ked T ; six 
large roller-towels ; a dozen hand-towels, marked H T ; 
and a dozen hemmed dish-cloths with loops. Also two 
thick linen pudding or dumpling-cloths, a jelly -bag made 
of white flannel, to strain jelly, a starch-strainer, and a bag 
for boiling clothes. 

• In a closet should be kept, arranged in order, the follow- 
ing articles : the dust-pan, dust-brush, and dusting-cloths, 



376 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

old flan]iel and cotton for scouring and rubLing, large 
sponges for washing windows and looking-glasses, a long 
brush for cobwebs, and another for washing the outside 
of windows, whisk-brooms, common brooms, a coat- broom 
or brush, a whitewash-brush, a stove-brush, shoe-brushes 
and blacking, articles for cleaning tin and silver, leather 
for cleaning metals, bottles containing stain-mixtures and 
other articles used in cleansing. 

CAEB OF THE CBLLAB. 

A collar should often be whitewashed, to keep it sweet. 
It should have a drain to keep it perfectly dry, as standing 
water in a cellar is a sure cause of disease in a family. It 
is very dangerous to leave decayed vegetables in a cellar. 
Many a fever has been caused by the poisonous miasm thus 
generated. The following articles are desirable in a cel- 
lar : a safe, or movable closet, with sides of wire or perfo- 
rated tin, in wliich cold meats, cream, and other articles 
should be kept ; (if ants be troublesome, set the legs in tin 
cups of water ;) a refrigerator, or a large wooden-box, on 
feet, with a lining of tin or zinc, and a space between the 
tin and wood filled with powdered charcoal, having at the 
bottom a place for ice, a drain to carry off the water, and 
also movable shelves and partitions. In this, articles are 
kept cool.' It should be cleaned once a week. Filtering 
jars to purify water should also be kept in the cellar. 
Fish and cabbages in a cellar are apt to scent a house, and 
give a bad taste to other articles. 

STOBEROOM. 

Every house needs a storeroom, in which to keep tea, 
coffee, sugar, rice, candles, etc. It should be furnished 
with jars, having labels, a large spoon, a fork, sugar and 
flour-scoops, a towel, and a dish-cloth. 



THE CARE OF ROOMS. 311 

MODES OF DESTROYING INSECTS AND VERMIN. 

Bed-lugs should be kept away, by filling every chiuk in 
tbe bedstead with putty, and if it be old, painting it over. 
Of aU the mixtures for killing them, corrosvoe sublimate 
and alcohol is the surest. This is a strong poison. 

Cockroaches may be destroyed by pouring boiling water 
into their haunts, or setting a mixture of arsenic mixed 
with Indian meal and molasses where they are found. 
Chloride of lime and sweetened water will also poison 
them. 

Fleas. — If a dog be infested with these insects, put him 
in a tub of warm soapsuds, and they will rise to the sur- 
face. Take them off, and burn them. Strong perfumes 
about the person diminish their attacks. "When caught 
between the fingers, plunge them in water, or they will 
escape. 

Orickets. — Scalding, and sprinkling Scotch snuff about 
the haunts of these insects, are remedies for the annoyance 
caused by them. 

Flies can be killed in great quantities, by placing about 
the house vessels filled with sweetened water and cobalt. 
Six cents' worth of cobalt is enough for a pint of water. 
It is very poisonous. 

Mosquitoes. — Close nets around a bed are the only sure 
protection at night against these insects. Spirits of harts- 
liorn is the best antidote for their bite. Salt and water is 
good. 

Sed or Jilack Ants may be driven away by scalding 
their haunts, and putting Scotch snuff wherever they go 
for food. Set the legs of closets and safes in pans of water 
and they can not get at them. 

Moths. — Airing clothes does not destroy moths, but lay- 
ing them in a hot sun does. If articles be tightly sewed 
up in linen when laid away, and fine tobacco put about 
them, it Js a sure protection. This should be done in 
April 



378 TEE ROVSEKEEPBR'S MANUAL. 

Hats cmd Mice. — A good cat is the best remedy for these 
annoyances. Equal quantities of hemlock (or oicuta) and 
old cheese will poison them ; but this renders the house lia- 
ble to the inconvenience of a bad smell. This evil, however, 
may be lessened, by placing a dish containing oil of vitriol 
poured on saltpetre where the smell is most annoying. 
Chloride of lime and water is also good. 

In using any of the above-mentioned poisons, great care 
should be taken to guard against their getting into any 
article of food or any utensil or vessel used for cooking or 
keeping food, or where childi-en can get at them.

THE "OAEE OF TAED8 AND GAKDENS. 

FiEST, let US say a few words on the Pr&pa/raUon of Soil. 
If the garden soil be clayey and adhesive, put on a covering 
of sand, three iaches thick, and the same depth of well-rot- 
ted manure. Spade it in as deep as possible, and mix it well. 
If the soil be sandy and loose, spade in clay and ashes. 
Ashes are good for all kinds of soU, as they loosen those 
which are close, hold moisture in those which are sandy, 
and destroy insects. The best kind of soil is that which 
win hold water the longest without becomiug hard when 
dry. 

To prepare Soil for Pot-plants, take one fourth part of 
common soil, one fourth part of well-decayed manure, and 
one half of vegetable mould, from the woods or from a 
chip-yard. Break up the manure fine, and sift it through 
a lime-screen, (or coarse wire sieve.) These materials must 
be thoroughly mixed. When the common soil which is 
used is adhesive, and indeed in most other cases, it is ne- 
cessary to add sand, the proportion of which must depend 
on the nature of the soil. 

To Prepm-6 a Hot-Bed, dig a pit six feet long, five feet 
wide, and thirty inches deep. Make a frame of the same size, 
• with the back two feet high, the front fifteen inches, and the 
sides sloped from the back to the front. Make two sashes, 
each three feet by five, with the panes of glass lapping 
like shingles instead of having cross-bars. Set the frame 
over the pit, which should then be filled with fresh horse- 
dung, which has not lain long nor been sodden by water. 



380 TEE HOUSEKEEPER' B MANUAL. 

Tread it aown hard ; then put into the frame light and 
very rich soil, six or eight inches deep, and cover it with 
the sashes for two or three days. Then stir the soil, and 
sow the seeds in shallow drills, placing sticks by them, 
to mark the different' kinds. Keep the frame covered with 
the glass whenever it is cold enough to chill the plants; 
but at all other times admit fresh air, which is indispensa- 
ble to their health. When the sun is quite warm, raise 
the glasses enough to admit air, and cover them with mat- 
ting or blankets, of else the sun may kill the young plants. 
Water the bed at evening with water which has stood all 
day, or, if it be fresh drawn, add a little warm water. If 
there be too much heat in the bed, so as to scorch or wither 
the plants, lift the sashes, water freely, shade by day ; make 
deep holes with stakes, and fill them up when the heat 
is reduced. In very cold nights, cover the sashes and 
frame with straw-mats. 

For Planting Flower Seeds. — Break up the soil, till it is 
very soft, and free from lumps. Hub that nearest the sur- 
face between the hands, to make it fine. Make a circular 
drill a foot in diameter. Seeds are to be planted either 
deeper or nearer the surface, according to their size. For 
seeds as large as sweet peas, the drill should be half an inch 
deep. The smallest seeds must be planted very near the sur- 
face, and a very little fine earth be sifted over them. After 
covering them with soil, beat them down with a trowel, so as 
to make the earth as compact as it is after a heavy shower. 
"Set up a stick in the middle of the circle, with the 
name of the plant heavily written upon it with a dark lead 
pencil. This remains more permanent if white-lead be first 
rubbed over the surface. Never plant when the soil is very 
wef. In very dry times, water the seeds at night. ]S"ever use 
very cold water. When the seeds are small, many should be 
planted together^ that they may assist each other in break- 
ing the soil. When the plants are an inch high, thin them 
out, leaving only one or two, if the plant be a large one' 



CASE OF TAEDS AND GARDENS. 381 

like the balsam ; five or six, wlieii it is of a medium size ; 
and eighteen or twenty of the smaller size. Transplant- 
ing, unless the plant be lifted with a ball of earth, retards 
the growth about a fortnight. It is best to plant at two 
different times, lest the first planting should fail, owing to 
wet or cold weather. 

To plant Ga/rden-Seeds, make the beds from one to 
three yards wide ; lay across them a board a foot wide, 
and with a stick, make a farrow on each side of it, one 
inch deep. Scatter the seeds in this furrow, and cover 
them. Then lay the board over them, and step on it, to 
press down the earth. "When the plants are an inch high, 
thin them out, leaving spaces proportioned to their sizes. 
Seeds of similar species, such as melons and squashes, 
should not be planted very near to each other, as this causes 
them to degenerate. The same kinds of vegetables should 
not be planted in the same place for two years in succes- 
sion. The longer the rows are, the easier is the after cul- 
ture. 

Transplcmtmg should be done at evening, or which is 
better, just before a shower. Take a round stick sharpened 
at the point, and make openings to receive the plants. Set . 
them a very little deeper than they were before, and press 
the soil firmly round them. Then water them, and cover 
them for three or four days, taking care that sufficient air be 
admitted. If the plant can be removed without disturbing 
the soil around the root, it will not be at all retarded -by , 
transplanting. Never remove leaves and branches, unless 
a part of the roots be lost. 

To Re-pot House-Plants, renew the soil every year, soon 
after the time of blossoming. Prepare soil as previously 
directed. Loosen the earth from the pot by passing a 
knife around the sides. Turn the plant upside down, and 
remove the pot. Then remove all the matted fibres at the 
bottom, and all the earth, except that which adheres to the 
roots. From woody plants, like roses, shake off all the 



382 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

earth. Take the new pot, and put a piece of broken 
earthen- ware over the hole at the bottom, and then, hold- 
ing the plant in the proper position, shake in the earth 
around it. Then pour in water to settle the earth, and 
heap on fresh soil, tiU the pot is even full. Small pots are 
considered better than large ones, as the roots are no! so 
likely to rot, from excess of moisture. 

In the Laying out of Yards and Gardens, there is room 
for much judgment and taste. In planting trees in a yard, 
tliey should be arranged in groups, and never planted in 
straight lines, nor sprinkled about as solitary trees. The 
ob]'ect of this arrangement is to imitate Nature, and secure 
some spots of dense shade and some of clear turf. In 
yards which are covered with turf, beds can be cut out of 
it, and raised for flowers. A trench should be made around, 
to prevent the grass from running on them. These beds 
can be made in the shape of crescents, ovals, or other fan- 
ciful forms. 

In laying out beds in gardens and yards, a very pretty 
bordering can be made, by planting them with common 
flax-seed, in a line about three inches from the edge. This 
can be trimmed with shears, when it grows too high. 

For Transplanting Trees, the autumn is the best time. 
Take as much of the root as possible, especially the little 
fibres, which should never become dry. If kept long be- 
fore they are set out, put wet moss around them and water 
them. Dig holes larger than the extent of the roots ; let 
one person hold the tree in its former position, and another 
place the roots carefully as they were before, cutting off 
any broken or wounded root. JBe careful not to let the tree 
he more than an inch deeper than it was hefore. Let the soil 
be soft and well manured ; shake the tree as the soil is 
shaken in, that it may mix well among the small fibres. Do 
not tread the earth down, while filling the hole ■ but 
when it is full, raise a slight mound of say four inches 
deep around the stem to kold water, and fill it. Never

cut off leayes nor branclies, unless some of tlie roots are 
lost. Tie the trees to a stake, and they will be more likely 
to li-ve. "Water them often. 

The Care of House-Plants is a matter of daily atten- 
tion, and well repays all labor expended upon it. The soil 
of house-plants should be renewed every year as previous- 
ly directed. In winter, they should be kept as dry as they 
can be without wilting. Many house-plants are injured 
by giving them too much water, when they have little light 
and fresh air. This makes them grow spindling. The 
more fresh air, warmth and light they have, the more wa- 
ter is needed. They ought not to be kept very warm in 
winter, nor exposed to great changes of atmosphere. For- 
ty degrees is a proper temperature for plants in winter, 
when they have little sun and air. "WTien plants have be- 
come spindling, cut off their heads entirely, and cover the 
pot in the earth, where it has the morning sun only. A 
new and flourishing head will spring out. Few house- 
plants can bear the sun at noon. When insects infest 
plants, set them in a closet or under a barrel, and burn to- 
bacco under them. The smoke kills any insect enveloped 
in it. When plants are frozen, cold water and a gradual 
restoration of warmth are the best remedies. Never use 
very cold water for plants at any season.

THE PKOPAGATION OF PLANTS. 

This is an occupation requiring much attention and con- 
stant care. Bulbous roots are propagated by offsets ; some 
growing on the top, others around the sides. Many plants 
are propagated by cutting off twigs, and setting them in 
earth, so that two or three eyes are covered. To do this, 
select a side shoot, ten inches^ loiig) two inches of it being 
of the preceding year's growth, and the rest the growth 
of the season when it is set. Do this when the sap is 
running, and put a piece of crockery at the bottom of the 
shoot, when it is buried. One eye, at least, must be under 
the soil. "Water it and shade it iu hot weather. 

Plants are also propagated by layers. To do this, take 
a shoot which comes up near the root, bend it down so as 
to bring several eyes under the soil, leaving the top above- 
ground. If the shoot be cut haK through, in a slanting 
direction, at one of these eyes, before burying it, the re- 
sult is more certain. Roses, honeysuckles, and many other 
shrubs are readily propagated thus. They will generally 
take root by being simply buried ; but cutting them as 
here directed is the best method. Layers are more certain 
than cuttings. 

Budding and Qraftmg, for all woody plants, are favo- 
rite methods of propagation. In all such plants, there is 
an outer and inner bark, the latter containing the sap ves- 
sels, in which the nourishment of the tree ascends. The suc- 
cess of grafting or inoculating consists in so placing the 
bud or graft that the sap vessels of the inner bark shall

exactly join those of the plant into which they are grafted, 
so that the sap may pass from one into the other. 

The following are directions for ludding, which may be 
performed at any time fi-om July to September : 

Select a smooth place on the stock into which yon are to 
insert the bud. Make a horizontal cut across the rind 
through to the firm wood ; and from the middle of this, 
make a slit downward perpendicularly, an inch or more 
long, through to the wood. Eaise the bark of the stock on 

each side of 
the perpen- 
dicular cut, 
for the ad- 
mission of 
the bud, as 
is shown in 
the annexed 
engraving, 
(Fig. 64.) 
Then take a 
shoot of 
this year's 
growth, and 
slice from it 
a bud, tak- 
ing an inch 
below and 
an inch 
aboTe it, 
and some portion of the wood under it. Then, carefully 
slip off the woody part under the bud. Examine whether 
the eye or germ of the bud be perfect. If a little hole ap- 
pear in that part, the bud has lost its root, and another 
must be selected. Insert the bud, so that a, of the bud, 
shall pass to a, of the stock ; then h, of the bud, must be 
cut off, to match the cut b, in the stock, and fitted exactly 




386 



THE EOVSEKEEPER'S MANUAL.

to it, as it is this alone which insures success. Bind the 
parts with fresh bass or woolen yarn, beginning a little 
below the bottom of the perpendicular slit, and winding it 
closely around every part, except just over the eye of the 
bud, until you arrive above the horizontal cut. Do not 
bind it too tightly, but just siiificient to exclude air, sun, 
and wet. This is to be removed after the bud is firmly 
fixed, and begins to grow. 

Seed-fruit can be budded into any other seed-fruit, and 
stone-fruit into any other stone-fruit ; but stone and seed- 
fruits can not be thus mingled. 

Eose-bushes can have a variety of kinds budded into the 
same stock. Hardy roots are the best stocks. The branch 
above the bud must be cut off the next March or April af- 
ter the bud is put in. Apples and pears are more easily 
propagated by ingrafting than by budding. 

Ingrafting is a similar process to budding, 
with this advantage, that it can be per- 
formed on large trees, whereas budding can 
be applied only on small ones. The two com- 
mon kinds of ingrafting are whip-grafting and 
split-grafting. The first kind is for young 
"trees, and the other for large ones. 

The time for ingrafting is from May to 
October. The cuttings must be taken from 
horizontal shoots, between Christmas and 
March, and kept in a damp cellar. In per- 
forming the operation, cut off in a sloping 
direction (as seen in Fig. 65) the tree or 
limb to be grafted. Then cut off in a cor- 
responding slant the slip to be grafted on. 
Then put them together, so that the inner 
bark of each shall match exactly on one 
side, and tie them firmly together with yel- 
low yam. It is not essential that both be 
of equal size ; if the bark of each meet together exactly

on one side, it answers tlie purpose. But tlie two must 
not differ much in size. The slope shoiild be an inch and 
a half, or more, in length. After they are tied together, 
the place should be covered with a salve or composition of 
bees-w^ and rosin. A mixture of clay and cow-dung will 
answer the same purpose. This last must be tied on with 
a cloth. Grafting is more convenient than budding, as 
grafts can be sent from a great distance ; whereas buds 
must be taken in July or August, from a shoot of the 
present year's growth, and can not be sent to any great dis- 
tance. 

This engraving (Fig.' 66) exhibits the 
mode called stock-grafting ; a being the 
limb of a large tree, which is sawed off 
and split, and is to be held open by a 
small wedge till the grafts are put in. 
A graft inserted in the limb is shown 
at 5, and at c is one not inserted, but de- 
signed to be put in at d, as two grafts 
can be put into a large stock. In in- 
serting the graft, be careful to make the 
edge of the inner bark of the graft meet 
exactly the edge of the inner bark of the 
stock ; for on this success depends. Af- 
ter the grafts are put in, the wedge must 
be withdrawn, and the whole of the stock be covered with 
the thick salve or composition before mentioned, reaching 
from where the grafts are inserted to the bottom of the 
slit. Be careful not to knock or move the grafts after they 
are put in. 

Pruning is an operation of constant exercise, for keep- 
ing plants and trees in good condition. The following 
rules are from a distinguished horticulturist : Prune off 
all dead wood, and all the little twigs on the main limbs. 
Ketrench branches, so as to give light and ventilation to the 
interior of the tree. Out out the straight and perpendi-

cular shoots, wliicli give little or no fruit; while those 
which are most nearly horizontal, and somewhat curving, 
give fruit abundantly and of good quality, and should 
be sustained. Superfluous and ill-placed buds may be 
rubbed off at any time ; and no buds pushing out after 
midsummer should be spared. In choosing between shoots 
to be retained, preserve the lowest placed, and on lateral 
shoots, those which are nearest the origin. When branches 
cross each other so as to rub, remove one or the other. 
Remove all suckers from the roots of trees or shrubs. 
Prune after the sap is in full circulation, (except in the 
case of grapes,) as the wounds then heal best. Some think 
it best to prune before the sap begins to run. Pruning- 
shears, and a pruning-pole, with a chisel at the end, can 
be procured of those who deal in agricultural utensils. 

Thinnvng is also an important but very delicate opera- 
tion. As it is the office of the leaves to absorb nourishment 
from the atmosphere, they should never be removed, except 
to mature the wood or fruit. In doing this, remove such 
leaves as shade the fruit, as soon as it is ready to ripen. 
To do it earlier impairs the growth. Do it gradually at two 
different times. Thinning the fruit is important, as tend- 
ing to increase its size and flavor, and also to promote 
the longevity of the tree. If the fruit be thickly set, take 
off one half at the time of setting. Revise in June, and 
then in July, taking off all that may be spared. One very 
la/rge apple to every square foot is a rule that may be a 
sort of guide in other cases. According to this, two hun- 
dred large apples would be allowed to a tree whose extent 
is fifteen feet by twelve. If any person think this thinning 
excessive, let him try two similar trees, and thin one as di- 
rected and leave the other unthinned. It will be found 
that the thinned tree wiU produce an equal weight, and 
fruit of much finer fiavor.

THE CULTIVATION OF FEUIT. 

By a little attention to this matter, a lady witL. tlie help 
of her children can obtain a rich abundance of all kinds 
of fruit. The writer has resided in families where little 
boys of eight, ten, and twelve years old amused themselves, 
under the direction of their mother, in planting walnuts, 
chestnuts, and hazelnuts, for future time ; as well as in 
planting and inoculating young fruit-trees of all descrip- 
tions. A mother who will take pains to inspire a love for 
such pursuits in her children, and who will aid and super- 
intend them, will save them from many temptations, and 
at a trifling expense secure to them and herself a rich re- 
ward in the choicest fruits. The information given in this 
work on this subject may be relied on as sanctioned by 
the most experienced nursery-men. 

The soil for a nursery should be rich, well dug, dressed 
with well-decayed manure, free from weeds, and protected 
from cold winds. Fruit-seeds should be planted in the au- 
tumn, an inch and a half or two inches deep, in ridges four 
or five feet apart, pressing the earth firmly over the seeds. 
While growing, they should be thinned out, leaving the 
best ones a foot and a half apart. The soil should be kept 
loose, soft, and free from weeds. They should be inoculat- 
ed or ingrafted when of the size of a pipe stem ; and in a 
year after this may be transplanted to their permanent 
stand. Peach-trees sometimes bear in two years from bud- 
ding, and in four years from planting if well kept. 

In a year after transplanting, take pains to train the head 
aright. Straight upright branches produce gov/rrtiornds, or 



390 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

twigs bearing only leaves. The side branclies which arc 
angular or curved yield the most finiit. For this reason, 
the limbs should be trained in curves, and perpendicular 
twigs should be cut off if there be need of pruning. The 
last of June is the time for this Grass should never be al- 
lowed to grow within four feet of a large tree, and the 
soil should be kept loose to admit air to the roots. Trees 
in orchards should be twenty-five feet apart. The soil 
uThder the top soil has much to do with the health of 
the trees. If it be what is called liard-jpan, the trees will 
deteriorate. Trees need to be manured and to have the 
soil kept open and free from weeds. 

FiTbeHs cad be raised in any part of this country. 

Figs can be raised in the Middle, "Western, and Southern 
States. For this purpose, in the autumn loosen the roots on 
one side, and bend the tree down to the earth on the other ; 
then cover it with a mound of straw, earth, and boards, 
and early in the spring raise it up and cover the roots. 

Ourrants grow well in any but a wet soil. They are 
propagated by cuttings. The old wood should be thinned 
in the fall and manure be put on. They can be trained 
into small trees. 

Gooseberries are propagated by layers and cuttings. 
They are best when kept from suckers and trained like 
trees. One third of the old wood should be remov^ 
every autumn. 

Maspberries do best when shaded during a part of the 
day. They are propagated by layers, slips, and suckers. 
There is one kind which bears monthly ; but the varieties 
of this and all other fruits are now so numerous that we 
can easily find those which are adapted to the special cir- 
cumstances of the case. 

Strawberries require a light soil and vegetable manure. 
They should be transplanted in April or September, and 
be set eight inches apart, in rows nine inches asunder, and 
in beds which are two feet wide, with narrow alleys be-

tween them. A part of these plants are non-'bearers. These 
have large flowers with showy stamens and high black 
anthers. The hearers have short stamens, a great number 
of pistils, and the flowers are every way less showy. In 
blossom-time, pull out all the non-bearers. Some think it 
best to leave one non-bearer to every twelve bearers, and 
others pull them all out. Many beds never produce any 
fruit, because all the plants in them are non-bearers. 
Weeds should be kept from the vines. When the vines 
are matted with young plants, the best way is to dig over 
the beds in cross lines, so as to leave some of the plants 
standing in little squares, while the rest are turned under 
the soil. This should be done over a second time in the 
same year. 

To liaise Grapes, manure the soil, and keep it soft and 
free from weeds. A gravelly or sandy soil, and a south ex- 
posure are best. Transplant the vines in the early spring, 
or better in the fall. Prune them the first year so as to 
have only two main branches, taking off all other shoots as 
fast as they come. In November, cut off all of these two 
branches except four eyes. The second year, in the spring, 
loosen the earth around the roots, and allow only two 
branches to grow, and every month take off all side shoots. 
When they are very strong, preserve only a part, and cut 
off the rest in the fall. In November, cut off all the two 
main stems except eight eyes. After the second year, no 
more pruning is needed, except to reduce the side shoots, 
for the purpose of increasing the fruit. All the pruning ol 
grapes (except nipping side shoots) must be done when 
the sap is not running, or they will bleed to death. Train 
them on poles, or lattices, to expose them to the air and 
sun. Cover tender vines in the autumn. Grrapes are 
propagated by cuttings, layers, and seeds. For cuttings, 
select in the autumn well-ripened wood of the former year, 
and take five joints for each. Bury them till April ; then 
soak them for some hours, and set them out askmt, so that 
all the eyes but one shall be covered. 



392 TEE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Apples, grapes, and such like fruit can be preserved in 
their natural state by packing them when dry and solid in 
dry sand or saw-dust, putting alternate layers of fruit and 
cotton, saw-dust or sand. Some saw-dust gives a bad flavor 
to the fruit. 

Modes of Preserving Fruit-Trees. — Heaps of ashes or tan- 
ner's bark around peach-trees prevent the attack of the 
worm. The yellows is a disease of peach-trees, which is 
spread by the pollen of the blossom. When a tree begins 
to turn yellow, take it away with all its roots, before it 
blossoms again, or it will infect other trees. Planting tan- 
sy around the roots of fruit-trees is a sure protection 
against worms, as it prevents the moth from depositing 
her egg. Equal quantities of salt and saltpetre, put 
around the trunk of a peach-tree, half a pound to a tree, 
improve the size and flavor of the fruit. Apply this about 
the flrst of April ; and if any trees have worms already in 
them, put on half the quantity in addition in June. To 
young trees just set out, ■apply one ounce in April, and 
another in June, close to the stem. Sandy soil is best for 
peaches. 

Apple-trees are preserved from insects by a wash of 
strong lye to the body and limbs, which, if old, should be 
flrst scraped. Caterpillars should be removed by cutting 
down their nests in a damp day. Boring a hole in a tree 
infested with worms, and fllling it with sulphur, will often 
drive them off immediately. 

The fire-llight or brdlv/re in pear-trees can be stopped by 
cutting off all the blighted branches. It is supposed by 
some to be owing to an excess of sap, which is remedied by 
diminishing the roots. 

The curoulio, which destroys plums and other stone- 
fruit, can be checked only by gathering up all the fruit 
that falls, (which contains their eggs,) and destroying it. 
The canker-worm can be checked by applying a bandage 
around the body of the tree, and every evening smearing 
it with fresh tar.

THE OAUB OF DOMESTIO A1TIMA18, 

One of the most interesting illustrations of the design 
of our benevolent Creator in establishing the family 
state is the nature of the domestic animals connected with 
it. At the very dawn of life, the infant watches with de- 
light the graceful gambols of the kitten, and soon makes it 
a playmate. Meantimey its out-cries when hurt appeal 
to kindly sympathy, and its sharp claws to fear; while 
the child's mother has a constant opportunity to incul- 
cate kindness and care for weak and ignorant creatures. 
Then the dog becomes the out-door playmate and guardian 
of early childhood, and he also guards hmiself by cries of 
pain, and protects himself by his teeth. At the same time, 
his faithful loving nature and caresses awaken correspond- 
ing tenderness and care; while the parent again has a 
daily opportunity to inculcate these virtues toward the 
helpless and dependent. As the child increases in know- 
ledge and reason, the horse, cows, poultry, and other do- 
mestic animals come under his notice. These do not ordi- 
narily express their hunger or other sufferings by cries of 
distress, but depend more on the developed reason and 
humanity of man. And here the parent is called upon to 
instruct a child in the nature and wants of each, that he 
may intelligently provide for their sustenance and for their 
protection from injury and disease. 

To assist in this important duty of home life, which so 
often falls to the supervision of woman, the following 
information is prepared through the kindness of one of 



394 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

the editors of a prominent, widely known agricultural 
paper. 

Domestic animals are very apt to catch the spirit and 
temper of their masters. A surly man wiU be very likely 
to have a cross dog and a biting hOrse. A -passionate man 
wiU keep all his animals ^.r. -fi'tral fear of him, making 
them snappish, and liable to hurt those of whom they are 
not afraid. 

It isj therefore, most important that all animals should 
be treated uniformly with kindness. They are all capable 
of returning affection, and will show it very pleasantly it 
we manifest affection for them. They also have intuitive 
perceptions of our emotions which we can not conceal. A 
sharp, ugly dog will rarely bite a person who has no fear ot 
him. A horse knows the moment a man mounts or takes 
the reins whether he is afraid or not; and so it is with 
other animals. 

If live stock can not be well fed, they ought not to be 
kept. One well wintered horse is worth as much as two. 
that drag through on straw, and by browsing the hedge- 
rows. The same is true of oxen, and emphatically so of 
cows. The owner of a half-starved dog loses the use of 
him almost altogether ; for, at the very time — ^the night — 
when he is most needed as a guard, he must be off scou- 
ring the country for food. 

Shelter in winter is most important for cows. They 
should have good tight stables or byres, weU ventilated, 
and so warm that water in a pail will only freeze a little 
on the top the severest nights. Oxen should have the 
same stabling, though they bear cold better. Horses in 
stables will bear ahnost any degree of cold, if they have 
all they can eat. Sheep, except young lambs, are well 
enough sheltered in dry sheds, with one end open. Cattle, 
sheep, and dogs do not sweat as horses do, they " loU ;" 
that is, water or slabber runs from their tongues ; hence, 
they are not liable to take cold as the horse is. Hogs bea»

cold pretty well ; but they eat enough to convince any one 
that true economy lies in giving them warm sties in win- 
ter, for the colder they are the more they eat. Fowls will 
not lay in cold weather unless they have light and warm 
quarters. 

Cleanliness is. indispensable, if one would keep his ani- 
mals healthy. In their wild state all our domestic animals 
are very clean, and, at the same time, very healthy. The 
hog is not naturally a dirty animal, but quite the reverse. 
He enjoys -currying as much as a horse or a cow, and 
would be as careful of his litter as a cat if he had a fair 
chance. 

Horses ought to be groomed daily ; cows and oxen as of- 
ten as twice a week ; dogs should be washed with soapsuds 
frequently. Stables should be cleaned out daily. Absorb- 
ents of liquid in stables should be removed as often as they 
become wet. Dry earth is one of the best absorbents, and 
is especially useful in the fowl-house. Hogs in pens should 
have straw for their rests or lairs, and it should be often 
renewed. 

Parasitic Vermin. — These are lice, fleas, ticks, the scale 
, insects, and other pests which afflict our live stock. There 
are many ways of destroying them ; the best and safest is a 
free use of carbolic acid soap. The larger animals, as well as 
hogs, dogs, and sheep may be washed in strong suds of this 
soap, without fear, and the application repeated after a week. 
This generally destroys both the creatures and their eggs. 
Hen lice are best destroyed by greasing the fowls, and dust- 
ing them with flowers of sulphur. Sitting hens must 
never be greased, but the sulphur may be dusted freely in 
their nests, and it is well to put it in all hens' nests. 

Salt and Water.— AW animals except poultry require 
salt, and all, free supplies of fresh water. 

Zj^A^.— Stables, or places where any kind of animals are 
confined, should have plenty of light. Windows are not 
more important in a house than in a barn. The sun 



396 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

should come in freely ; and if it shines directly ujon the 
stock, aU the better. When beeves and sheep are fat- 
tening very rapidly, the exclusion of the light makes them 
more quiet, and fatten faster; but their state is an un- 
natural and hardly a healthy one. 

Exercise in the open air is important for breeding ani- 
mals. It is especially necessary for horses of all kinds. 
Cows need very little and swine none, unless kept for 
breeding. 

Breeding. — Always use thorough-bred males, and im- 
provement is certain. 

Sorses. — The care which horses require varies with the 
circumstances in which the owner is placed, and the uses 
to which they are put. In general, if kept stabled, they 
should be fed with good upland hay, almost as much as 
they will eat ; and if absent from the stable, and at work 
most of the day, they should have all they wiU eat of hay, 
together with four to eight quarts of oats or an equal 
weight of other grain or meal. Barley is good for horses, 
and so is dry corn. Corn-meal put upon cut hay, wet and 
well-mixed, is good, steady feed, if not in too large quanti- 
ties. Four quarts a day may be fed unmixed with other 
grain ; but if the horse be hard worked and needs more, 
mix the meal with wheat bran, or linseed oil-cake meal, 
or use corn and oats ground together ; carrots are especially 
wholesome. A quart of linseed oil-cake meal, daily, is an 
excellent occasional addition to a horse's feed, when car- 
rots can not be had. It gives a lustre to his coat, and 
brings the new coat of hair out in the spring. A stabled 
horse needs daily exercise, as much as to trot three miles. 
"Where a horse is traveling, it is well to give him six quarts 
of oats in the morning, four at noon, and six at night. 

Thorough grooming is indispensable to the health of 
horses. Especial care should be taken of the legs and fet- 
locks, that no dirt remain to cause that distressing disease, 
grease or scratches, which results from filthy fetlocks and 



THE CARE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALa. Z9''i 

standing in dirty stables. When a horse comes in from 
work on muddy roads with dirty legs, they should be im- 
mediately cleaned, the dirt brushed off, then rubbed with 
straw ; then, if very dirty, washed clean and rubbed dry 
with a piece of sacking. A horse should never stand in a 
draught of cold air, if he can not turn and put his back to it. 
Tf sweaty or warm from work, he should be blanketed, if 
lie is to stand a minute in the winter air. If put at one" 
into the stable, he should be stripped and rubbed down 
with straw actively for five minutes or more, and then 
blanketed. The blanket must be removed in an hour, and 
the horse given water and feed, if it is the usual time. It 
will not hurt him to eat hay when hot, unless he be tho- 
roughly exhausted, when all food should be withheld for a 
while. 

It is very comforting to a tired horse, when he is too 
hot to drink, to sponge out his mouth with cool water. A 
horse should never drink when very hot, nor be turned 
into a yard to " cool off," even in summer, neither should 
he be turned out to pasture before he is quite cool. 

Cows. — Gentle but firm treatment will make a cow easy 
to milk and to handle in every way. If stabled or yarded, 
cows should have access to water at all times, or have it 
fi-equently offered to them. Clover hay is probably the 
best steady food for milch cows. Cornstalks cut up, tho- 
roughly soaked with water for tfalf a day, and then sprin- 
kled with corn or oil-cake meal is perhaps unsurpassed 
as good winter food for milch cows. The amount of meal 
may vary. With plenty of oil-meal, there is little danger 
of feeding too much, as that is loosening to the bowels and 
a safe nutritious article. Corn-meal alone, in large quan- 
tities, is too heating. Roots should, if possible, form part 
of the diet of a milch cow, especially before and soon after 
calving ; feed well before this period, yet not to make the 
cow very fat ; but it is better to err in that way than to 
have her " come in " thin. Take the calf, away from the 



398 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

mother as soon as it stands up, and the separation viiW 
worry neither dam nor young. This is always best, unless 
the calf is to be kept with the cow. The calf will soon 
learn to drink its food, if two fingers be held in its mouth. 
Let it have all the first drawn milk for three days as soon 
as milked ; after this, skimmed milk warmed to blood 
heat. Soon a little fine scalded meal may be mixed with 
the milk ; and it will, at tliree to five weeks old, nibble 
hay and grass. It is well also to keep a box containing 
some dry wheat- bran and fine corn-meal mixed in the calf- 
pen, so that calves may take as much as they like. 

In milking, put the fingers around the teat close to the 
bag ; then firmly close the forefingers of each hand alter- 
nately, immediately squeezing with the other fingers. 
The forefingers prevent the milk flowing back into the 
bag, while the others press it out. Sit with the left knee 
close to the right hind leg of the cow, the head pressed 
against her flank, the left hand always ready to ward off a 
blow from her feet, which the gentlest cow may give al- 
most without knowing it, if her tender teats be cut by long 
nails, or if a wart be hurt, or her bag be tender. She 
must be stripped dry every time she is milked, or she will 
dry up ; and if she gives much milk, it pays to milk three 
times a day, as nearly eight hours apart as possible. Never 
stop while milking till done, as this will cause the cow to 
stop giving milk. * 

To tether a cow, tie her by one hind leg, making the rope 
fast above the fetlock joint, and protecting the limb with 
a piece of an old bootleg or similar thing. ' The knot must 
be one that will not slip; regular fetters of iron bound 
with leather are much better. 

A cow should go unmilked two months before calving, 
and her milk should not be used by the family till four 
days after that time. 

Swine. — The filthy state of hog-pens is allowed on account 
of the amount of manure they will make by working ove^ 



THE CARE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS. 399 

all sorts of vegetable matter, spoiled hay, weeds, etc., etc. 
This is unhealthy for the family near and also for the ani 
mal. The hog is, naturally, a cleanly animal, and if given 
a chance he will keep himself very neat and clean. 
Breeding sows should have the range of a small pasture, 
and be regularly fed. They need fresh water constantly 
and often suffer for lack of it when they have liquid swill, 
which they do not like to di-ink. All hogs should have a 
warm, dry, well-littered pen to lie in, away from iflies and 
disturbance of any kind. They are fond of charcoal, and 
it is worth while frequently to throw a few handfuls where 
they can get at it. It has a very beneficial effect on the 
appetite, regulates the tone of the stomach and digestive 
organs, and can not do any harm. Pigs ought always to be 
well fed and kept growing fast ; and when being fattened, 
they should be penned always, the herd being sorted so 
that all may have an equal chance. It is well to feed 
soft com in the ear; biit hard com should always be 
groxmd and cooked for pigs. 

Sheep. — In the winter, sheep need deep, well-littered, 
dry sheds, dry yai'ds, and hay, wheat, or oat straw, as much 
as they will eat. They should be kept gaining by gi'ain reg- 
ularly fed to them, and so distributed that each gets its 
share. Com, either whole or ground, or oil-cake meal, or 
both, are used for fattening sheep. They will easily surfeit 
themselves on any grain excef t oil-meal, which is very safe 
feed for them, and usually economical. Strong sheep will 
often drive the weaker ones away, and so get more than 
their share of food and make themselves sick. This must 
be guarded against, and the flock sorted, keeping the weak- 
er and stronger apart. 

Sheep are very useful in clearing land of brush and cer- 
tain weeds, which they gnaw down and kill. To accom- 
plish this, the land must be overstocked, and it is best not to 
keep sheep on short pasturage more than a few weeks at a 
time ; but if they are returned after a few days, it will serve 



400 THE BQUSEKEEPEE'S MANUAL. 

as good a purpose as if they were to be kept on all the time. 
Sheep at pasture must be restrained by good fences, or they 
will be a great nuisance. Dog-proof hedge fences of Osage 
orange are to be highly recommended, wherever this plant 
will grow. Mutton sheep will generally pay better to 
raise than merinos, but they need more care. 

Poultry. — Few objects of labor are more remunerative 
than poultry, raised on a moderate scale. Turkeys, when 
young, need great care ; some animal food, dry, warm quar- 
ters, and must be kept out of the wet grass, and kept in 
when it rains. As soon as fledged, they become very 
hardy, and, with free range, will almost take care of 
themselves. Geese need water and good grass pasture. 
Ducks do very well without water to swim in, if they have 
all they need to drink. They will lay a great many eggs 
if kept shut in a pen until say eight o'clock in the morning. 
If let out earlier, they wander away, and will hide their 
nests, and lay only about as many eggs as they can cover. 
It is best to set duck's eggs under hens, and to keep young 
ducks shut up in a dry roomy pen for four weeks, at least. 
Fowls need light, warm, dry quarters in winter, plenty of 
feed, but not too much. They relish animal food, and 
ought to have some frequently to make them lay. Pork 
or beef sci'ap-cake can be bought for two to three cents a 
pound, and is very good for them. Any kind of grain, is 
good for poultry. Nothing is better than wheat screenings. 
Early hatched chickens must be kept in a warm, dry, sunny 
room, with plenty of gravel, and the hen should have no 
more than eight or nine chickens to brood ; though in sum- 
mer, one hen will take good care of fifteen. Little chickens, 
turkeys, and ducks need frequent feeding, and must have 
their water changed often. It is well to grease the body 
of the hen and the heads of the chicks with lard, in order 
to prevent their becoming lousy. 

Hens set about twenty days, and should be well fed and 
watered. Cold cr damp weather is bad for young fowls, 



THE CARE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS. 401 

and when they have been chilled, pepper-corns are a good 
remedy, in addition to the warmth of an inclosed dry 
place. 

The most absorbing part of the " "Woman's question " of 
the present time is the remedy for the varied sufferings of 
women who are widows or unmarried, and without means 
of siipport. As yet, few are aware how many sources of 
lucrative enterprise and industry lie open to woman in the 
employments du-ectly connected with the family state. A 
woman can invest capital in the dairy and qualify herseK 
to superintend a dairy farm as well as a man. And if she 
has no capital of her own, if well trained for this business, 
she can find those who have capital ready to furnish — an 
investment that well managed will become profitable. And, 
too, the raising of poultry, of hogs, and of sheep are all within 
the reach of a woman with proper abihties and training 
for this business. So that if a woman chooses, she can find 
employment both interesting and profitable in studying the 
care of domestic animals. 

Bees. — But one of the most profitable as well as interest- 
ing kinds of business for a woman is the care of bees. In 
a recent agricultural report, it is stated that one lady bought 
four hives for ten dollars, and in five years she was offered 
one thousand five hundred dollars for her stock, and re- 
fused it as not enough. In addition to this increlase of her 
capital, in one of these five years she sold twenty-two 
hives and four hundred and twenty pounds of honey. It 
is also stated that in five years one man, from six colonies 
of bees to start with, cleared eight thousand pounds of 
honey and one hundred and fifty-four colonies of bees. 

The raising of bees and their management is so cu- 
rious and as yet unknown an art in most parts of our 
country, that any directions or advice will be omitted in 
this volume, as requiring too much space, and largely set 
forth and illustrated in the second part. When properly 



402 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

instructed, almost any woman in the city, as easily as in 
the country, can manage bees, and make more profit than 
in any other method demanding so little time and labor. 
But in the modes ordinarily practiced, few can make any 
great profit in this employment. 

It is hoped a time is at hand when every woman will be 
trained to some employment by which she can secure to 
herself an independent home and means to support a fami- 
ly, in case she does not marry, or is left a widow, with her- 
self and a family to support.

±N some particulars, the Chinese are in advance of our 
own nation in neatness, economy, and healthful domestic 
arrangements. In China, not a particle of manm-e is 
wasted, and all that with us is sent off in drains and sewers 
from water-closets and privies, is collected in a neat manner 
and used for manure. This is one reason that the compact 
and close packing of inhabitants in their cities is practica 
ble, and it also accounts for the enormous yields of some of 
their crops. 

The earth-closet is an invention which relieves the most 
disagreeable item in domestic labor, and prevents the disa- 
greeable and unliealthful effluvium which is almost inevita- 
ble in all family residences. The general principle of 
construction is somewhat like that of a water-closet, except 
that in place of water is used dried earth. The resulting 
compost is without disagreeable odor, and is the richest spe- 
cies of manure. The expense of its construction and use is 
no greater than that of the common water-closet ; indeed, 
when the outlays for plumber's work, the almost inevitable 
troubles and disorders of water-pipes in a house, and the 
constant stream of petty repairs consequent upon careless 
construction or use of water-works are considered, the earth- 
closet is in itself much cheaper, besides being an accumu- 
lator of valuable matter. 

To give a clear idea of its principles, mode of fabrication, 
and use, we can not do better than to take advantage of 
the permission given by Mr. George E. Waring, Jr., of 



404 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Newport, E. I., autlior of an admirable pampUet on the 
subject, published in 1868 by " The Tribune Association" 
of New- York., Mr. Waring was formerly Agricultiual En- 
gineer of the New-York Central Park, and has given much 
attention to sanitary and agricultural engineering, having 
published several valuable frovks bearing in the same general 
direction. He is now consulting director of " The Earth- 
Closet Company," Hartford, Ct., which manufactures the 
apparatus and all things appertaining to it — any part which 
might be needed to complete a home-built structure, Put 
with generous and no less judicious freedom, they are en- 
deavoring to extend the knowledge of this wholesome and 
economical process of domestic sanitary engineering as 
widely as possible, and so allow us to present the following 
instructions for those who may desire to construct their own 
apparatus. 
In the brief introduction to his pamphlet, Mr. Waring 



" It is sufficiently understood, by all who have given the 
least thought to the subject, that the waste of the most vital 
elements of the soil's fertility, through our present practice 
of treating human excrement as a thing that is to be hurried 
into the sea, or buried in undergroimd vaults, or in some 
other way put' out of sight and out of reach, is full of dan- 
ger to our future prosperity. 

" Our bodies have come out of our fertile fields ; our 
prosperity is based on the production and the exchange of 
the earth's fruits ; and all our industry has its foundation 
in arts and interests connected with, or dependent on, a suc- 
cessful agriculture. 

" Liebig asserts that the greatness of the Koman empire 
was sapped by the Cloaca Maxima, through which the 
entire sewage of Eome was washed into the Tiber. The 
yearly decrease of productive power in the older grain re- 
gions of the West, and the increasing demand for manures 
in the Atlantic States, sufficiently prove that our own coun- 



BAMTH-CLOSETS. 405 

try is no exception to the rule that has established its sway 
over Europe. 

" The large class who will fail to feel the force of the 
agricultural reasons in favor of the reform which this pam- 
phlet is written to uphold, will realize, more clearly than 
farmers will, the importance of protecting dwellings against 
the gravest annoyance, the most fertile source of disease, 
and the most certain vehicle of contagion." 

Nevertheless, Mx. "Waring thinks that the agricultural 
argument is no mean or unimportant one, and says : 

" The importance of any plan fey which the excrement of 
our bodies may be returned to our fields is in a measure 
shovsTi in the following extract from an article that I fur- 
nished for the American Agricultural Annual for 1868. 

" The average population of New- York City — including 
its temporary visitors — is probably not less than 1,000,000. 
This population consumes food equivalent to at least 30,- 
000,000 bushels of corn in a year. Excepting the small pro- 
portion that is stored up in the bodies of the growing 
young, which is fully oiBset by that contained in the bodies 
of the dead, the constituents of the food are returned to the 
air by the hings and skin, or are voided as excrement. 
That which goes to the air was originally taken from the 
air by vegetation, and will be so taken again-: here is no 
waste. The excrement contains all that was furnished" by 
the mineral elements of the soil on which the food was pro- 
duced. 

" This all passes into the sewers, and is washed into the 
sea. Its loss to the present generation is complete. 

. . . " 30,000,000 bushels of corn contain, among 
other minerals, nearly 7000 tons of phosphoric acid, and 
this amount is annually lost in the wasted night-soil of New- 
York City.* 

* other mineral constituents of food — important ones, too — are washed 
away in even greater quantities through the same channels ; but this ele- 
ment is the best for illustration because its eflect in manure is the most 



406 T£E HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

" Piactically the human excrement of the whole country 
is nearly all so disposed of as to be lost to the soil. The 
present population of the United States is not far from 
35,000,000. On the basis of the above calculation, their 
annual food contains 200,000 tons of phosphoric acid, be- 
ing the amount contained in about 900,000 tons of bones, 
which, at the price of the best flour of bone, (for manure,) 
would be worth over $50,'000,000. It would be a moderate 
estimate to say that the other constituents of food are of at 
least equal value with the other constituents of the bone, 
and to assume $50,000,000 as the money value of the wast- 
ed night-soil of the United States every year. 

" In another view, the importance of this waste can not 
be estimated in money. Money values apply, rather, to the 
products of labor and to the exchange of these products. 
The waste of fertilizing matter reaches farther than the de- 
struction or exchange of products : it lessens the ability to 
produce. 

" If mill-streams were failing year by year, and steam 
were yearly losing force, and the ability of men to labor 
were yearly growing less, the doom of our prosperity would 
not be more plainly written, than if this slow but certain 
impoverishment of our soil were sure to continue. 

. . . . " But the good time is coming, when (as 
now in China and Japan) men must accept the fact that 
the soil is not a warehouse to be plundered — only a factory 
to be worked. Then they will save their raw material, in- 
utead of wasting it, and, aided by nature's wonderful laws, 
will weave over and over again the fabric by which we live 
and prosper. Men will build up as fast as men destroy ; 
old matters will be reproduced in new forms, and, as the 

striking, even so small a dressing as twenty pounds per acre, producing 
a marked effect on all cereal crops. Ammonia, too,wliich is so important 
tliat it is usual in England to estimate the value of manure in exact pro- 
portion to its supply of this element, is largely yielded by human excre- 
ment.

decaying forests feed the growing wood, so will all consumed 
food yield food again." 

With the above brief extract, we shall cease using marks 
of quotation, as the following information and statements 
are appropriated bodily, either directly or with mere modi- 
fications for brevity, from the little pamphlet of Mr. Waring. 

The earth-closet is the invention of the Rev. Henry 
Monle, of Fordington Vicarage, Dorsetshire, England. 

It is based on the power of clay, and the decomposed 
organic matter found in the soil, to absorb and retain all 
offensive odors and all fertilizing matters"; and it consists, 
essentially, of a mechanical contrivance (attached to the 
ordinary seat) for measuring out and discharging into the 
vault or pan below a suflBcient quantity of sifted dry earth 
to entirely cover the solid ordure and to absorb the urine. 

The discharge of earth is effected by an ordinary pull-up 
similar to that used in the water-closet, or (in the self-act- 
ing apparatus) by the rising of the seat when the weight 
of the person is removed. 

The vault or pan under the seat is so arranged that the 
accumulation may be removed at pleasure. 

From the moment when the earth is discharged, and 
the evacuation is covered, all offensive exhalation entirely 
ceases. Under certain circumstances, there may be, at 
times, a slight odor as of guano mixed with earth ; but this 
is so trifling and'so local, that a commode arranged on this 
plan may, without the least annoyance, be kept in use in 
any room. 

This statement is made as the result of personal experi- 
ence. Mr. Waring says : 

" I have in constant use in a room in my house an 
earth-closet commode ; and even when the pan is entirely 
full, with the accumulation of a week's use, visitors exam- 
ining it invariably say, with some surprise, 'You don't 
mean that this particular one has been used !' "

HOW TO MAKE A2^ BAETH-CLOSBT. 



The principle on which the earth-closet is based is as free 
to all as is the earth itself, and any person may adopt his 
own method of applying it. All that is necessary is to have 
a supply of coarsely sifted sun-dried earth with which to 
cover the bottom of the vessel to be used, and after use to 
cover the deposit. A small box of earth, and a tin scoop 
are sufficient to prevent the gravest annoyance of the sick- 
room. But, of course, for constant use, it is desirable to 
have a more convenient apparatus — something which re- 
quires less care, and is less troublesome in many ways. 

To this end, the patent invention of Mr. Moule is appK- 
cable. This comprises a tight receptacle under the seat, a 
reservoir for storing dry earth, and an apparatus to measure 
out the requisite quantity, and throw it upon the deposit. 




EARTH- CLOSETS.

The arrangement of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 67. 
A hopper-shaped reservoir, made of galvanized iron, is 
supported by a framework at the back of the seat, which 
rests on the framework a, a. Connected with the handle at 
the right-hand side, there is an iron lever, which operates a 
movable box at the bottom of the reservoir, and causes it to 
discharge its contents directly under the seat. "When the 
handle is dropped, the box returns to its position, and is 
immediately filled preparatory to another use. 

The hopper-shaped reservoir is supported by two pivots, 
and has a slight rocking or vibrating motion imparted to it 
by each lifting of the lever. This prevents the earth from 
becoming clogged, and insures its regular delivery ,

410 TEE EOUSEKEEFER'S MANUAL. 

The construction is more clearly shown in Fig. 68. 

In this figure, A is the vibrating hopper for holding the 
earth. Its capacity may be increased to any desired extent 
by building above it a straight-sized box of any height. It is 
not unusual, in fixed privies, to make this reservoir large 
enough to hold a supply for several months. As the earth 
is dry, there is no occasion for the use of any thing better 
than common pine boards in making this addition to the 
reservoir. 

B is one side of the wooden frame by which the hop- 
per is supported, and it may be made of one inch pine or 
spruce. 

C is a box of lacquered or galvanized iron, without either 
top or bottom. It moves on two pivots, one of which is 
shown on its exposed side. In its present position, its upper 
end opens into the hopper, and its lower end is closed by 
the stationary board over which it stands. When the han- 
dle is pulled up, the lever, which is connected with the box, 
jerks it rapidly up, so that its back side closes the opening 
,of the reservoir, and its bottom opens to the front. In its 
movement it discharges its contents of earth forward under 
the seat. When the handle is dropped, the box returns to 
its natural position, and is charged again. 

•D is one of the pivots — a corresponding one being on 
the other side — ^by which the hopper is supported, and on 
which it vibrates. 

a, a, a, a, a, a, are the parts of the framework, the di- 
mensions of which in feet and inches are given. 

The only essential part not shown is an earthen- ware pan 
without a bottom, similar to the pah of a water-closet, only 
not so deep and with a larger opening, which is attached to 
the under side of the seat, and which in a measure prevents 
the rising of dust, and conducts the urine to the point at 
which the most earth falls. This is the least important 
part of the invention, but it has a certain advantage.

THE ORDIKAEY PKIVY. 



In the circular published by the Earth-Closet Company, 
the following directions are given : 

" An ordinary fixed closet requires the apparatus to be 
placed at the back of, and in connection with, the usual seat ; 
the reservoir for containing the earth being placed above it. 
Under it there should be a chamber or vault about four feet 
by three wide, and of any convenient depth, with a paved 
or asphalted bottom, and the sides lined with cement.

Should there be an existing cesspool, it may be altered to 
the above dimensions. Into this the deposit and earth fall, 
and may remain there three, six, or twelve months, and 
continue perfectly inodorous and innoxious, merely requir- 
ing to be occasionally leveled by a rake or hoe. If, how- 
ever, it should be found impossible or inconvenient to have 
a vault underneath, a movable trough, of iron or tarred 
wood, on wheels, may be substituted. In this case, it will be 
advisable to raise the seat somewhat above the floor, to al- 
low the trough to be of sufEcient size. 

" By one form of construction, (the 'pull-up,') the pull- 
ing up of a handle releases a suiScient quantity of the dry 
earth, which is thrown into the pit or vault, covering the 
deposit and completely preventing all smell. By another, 
(the ' self-acting,') the same effect is produced by the 
action of the seat. The apparatus may be placed in, and 
adapted to, almost any existing closet or privy, and so ar- 
ranged that the supply and removal of earth may be carried 
on inside or outside as desired." 

The following is taken from the company's circular : 
" In the commode, the apparatus and earth-reservoir are 
self-contained, and a movable pail takes the place of the 
chamber or vault above described. This must be emptied 
as often as necessary, and the contents may be applied to 
the garden or field, or be allowed to accumulate in a heap 
under cover until wanted for use. This accumulation is 
inodorous, and rapidly becomes dry. The commode can 
stand in any convenient place in or out of doors. For use 
in bedrooms, hospital wards, infirmaries, etc., the commode 
is invaluable. It is entirely free from those faint, depress- 
ing odors common to portable water-closets and night-stools, 
and through its admission one of the greatest miseries of 
human life, the foul smells of the sick-room, and one of 
the most frequent means of commimicating infection, may 
be entirely prevented. It is invariably found that, if any 
failure takes place, it arises from the earth not heing proper •

h/ dry. Too much importance can not be attached to this 
requirement. The earth-commode will no more act pro- 
perly .without dry earth, than will a water-closet without 
water. 

" These commodes are made in a variety of patterns, 
from the cottage commode to the more expensive ones in 
mahogany or oak, and vary in price accordingly. They 
are made to act either by a handle, as in the ordinary 
water-closet, or self-acting on rising from the seat. The 
earth-resei-voir is calculated to hold enough for about 
twenty-five times ; and where earth is scarce, or the manure 
required of extraordinary strength, the product may be 
dried as many as seven times, and without losing any of its 
deodorizing properties. 

" If care be taken to cast one service of earth into the 
pail when first placed in the commode, and to have the 
commonest regard to cleanliness, not the least offensive 
snlell will be perceptible, though the receptacle remain un- 
emptied for weeks. Care must also be taken that no liquid, 
but that which they are intended to receive, be thrown into 
the pails." 

The pail used in the commode is made of galvanized 
iron, and is shaped very much like an ordinary coal-hod. 
It has a cover of the same material, and it may be carried 
from an upper floor with no more offensiveness than a hod- 
ful of common earth.

HOW TO USE THE BAKTH-CLOSBT. 



Under this head, the circular issued by the original Lon- 
don company contains the following : 

" The first requirement for the proper worMng of the 
6arth-closet is earth perfectly dry and sifted. 

" Earth alone is proved to be the best deodorizer, and 
far superior to any disinfectants ; but where it is difficult to 
obtain earth abundantly, sifted ashes, as before-stated, may 
be mixed with it in proportion of two of earth to one of 
ashes. 

" As the first requirement is dry ea/rih sifted^ and as thi& 



HARTS- CL 0SET8. 41ft 

is usually thought to be a great difficulty in the way of the 
adoption of the dry earth system, the following remarks 
. will at once remove such an impression. 

" The earth-commode and closet, if used by six persons 
daily, will reqiiire, on an ayerage, about one hundred weight 
of earth per week. This may be dried for family use in a 
drawer made to fit under the kitchen range, and which may 
he filled with earth one morning and left until the next. 
The drawer should reach to within two inches of the bottom 
bar of the grate. A frame with a handle, covered with 
fine wire-netting, forming a kind of shovel, should be 
placed on this drawer ; the finer ashes will fall through, 
mixing with the earth, whUst the cinders will remain on 
the top, to be, from time to time, thrown on the fire. 

" Of course, the most economical method is to provide 
in the summer-time a winter store of dry earth, which may 
be kept in an out-house, shed, or' other convenient place, 
just as we lay in a winter store of coals. 

"THINGS TO BE OBSEBTED. 

" Let one fall of earth be in the pail before uging, 
" The earth must be dry and sifted. , 
" Sand must not be used. 
" No ' slops ' must be thrown, down. 
" The handle must be pulled up with a jerk, and let fall 
sharply."

Concerning the value and use of the product of the earth- 
closet, the following is copied from the London company's 
circular. (It will be noticed that reference is made to the 
repeated use of the same earth. When the ordm-e is com- 
pletely dried and decomposed, it has not only lost its odor, 
but it has become, like all decomposed organic matter, an 
excellent disinfectant, and the fifth or sixth timq that the 
same earth is passed through the closet it is fully as effective 
in destroying odors as it was when used for the first time, 



416 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

and of course each use adds to its value as manure, until it 
becomes as strong as Peruvian guano, wMch is" now worth 
seventy-five dollars per ton. In fact, it may be made so 
rich that one hundred pounds will ie a good dressing for an 
acre of land) 

" If the closet is over a water-tight cesspool or pit, it will 
require emptying at the end of three or six months. The 
produce, which will be quite inodorous, should be thrown 
together in a heap, sheltered from wet, and occasionally 
turned over. At the end of a few weeks, it will be dry and 
fit for iise. 

" If the receptacle be an iron trough or pail, the contents 
should be thrown together, re-dried, and Used over again, 
foiu" or five times. In a few weeks they willbe dry and fit 
for use ; the value being increased by repeated action. The 
condition of the manui-e should be much the same as that 
of guano, and fit for drilling. 

The inventor of the earth-closet. Rev. Mr. Moule, says : 

" It was to this point (the power of earth or clajf to ab- 
sorb the products of the decomposition of manure) but par- 
ticularly to the repeated action, and consequently the re- 
peated use of the same earth, that I first directed the 
attention of the public. I then pointed out : First. That 
a very small portion of dry and sifted earth (one and a 
half pints) is sufiicient by covering the deposit, to prevent 
fennentation, (which so soon sets in whenever water is used,) 
and the consequent generation and emission of noxious 
gases. Second. That if within a few hours, or even a few 
days, the mass that would be formed by the repeated layers 
of deposit, be intimately mixed by a coarse rake or spade, 
or by a mixer made for the purpose, then, in five or ten 
minutes, neither to the eye or sense of smell is anj thing 
perceptible but so much earth. . . . When about three 
cart-loads of sifted earth had thus been used for my family, 
(which averaged fifteen persons,) and left under a shed, I 
found that the material first employed was sufficiently dried 



EARTH-CLOSETS. 417 

to be used again. This process of alternate mixing and 
drying was renewed five times, the earth still retaining its 
absorbent powers apparently unimpaired. Of the visitors 
taken to the spot, none could guess the nature of the com- 
post, though in some cases the heap which they visited in 
the afternoon had been turned over that same morning. . . 

" It, is only in towns, where the delivery, stowage, and 
removal of earth is attended with cost and difficulty, that 
any artificial aid for drying the compost would be desirable. 
On premises not cramped for space, the atmosphere, 
especially with a glass roof to the shed, will act sufiSciently 
fast. 

" You may by means of it (the earth system) have a privy 
close to the house and a closet up-stairs, from neither of 
which shall proceed any ofiensive smell or any noxious gas. 
A projection from the back of the cottage, eight feet long 
and six feet wide, would be amply sufficient for this purpose. 
The nearer three or four feet down-stairs, would be occupied 
by the privy, in which, by the seat, would be a receptacle 
for dry earth. The 'soil' and earth would fall into the 
further five or four feet, which would form the covered and 
closed shed for mixing and drying. Up-stairs, the an*ange- 
ment would be much the same, the deposit being made to 
fall clear of every wall. Through this closet the removal 
of noxious and offensive niatters in time of sickness, and of 
slop-buckets, would be immediate and easy ; and if the shed 
oelow be kept well supplied with earth, all effiuvium would 
be almost immediately checked. As to the trouble which 
this will cause, a very little experience will convince the 
cottager that it is less instead of greater, than the women 
generally go through at present, while the value of the 
manure will afford an inducement to exertion. 

" The truth is, that the machinery is more simple, much 
less expensive, and far less liable to injury than that of the 
water-closet. The supply of earth to the house is as easy 



418 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

as that of coals. To the closet it may be supplied more 
easily than water is supplied by a forcing-pump, and to the 
commode it can be conveyed just as coal is carried to the 
chamber. After use, it can be removed in either case by 
the bucket or box placed under the seat, or from the fixed 
reservoir, with less offense than that of the ordinary slo})- 
bucket — indeed, (I speak after four years' experience,) witli 
as little offense as is found in the removal of coal-ashes. 
So that, while servants and others will shrink from novelt)' 
and at iirst imagine difficulties, yet many, to my knowledge, 
would now vastly prefer the daily removal of the bucket or 
the soil to either the daily working of a forcing-pump or to 
being called upon once a year, or once in three years, to 
assist in emptying a vault or cesspool." 

To the above complete and convincingly apt arguments 
and statements of fact, we do not care to add any thing. 
All that we desire is to direct public attention to the ad- 
mirable qualities of this Earth System, and to suggest that, 
at least for those living in the country away from the many 
conveniences of city life, great water power, and mechanical 
assistance, the use of it will conduce largely to the economy 
of families, the health of neighborhoods, and the increasing 
fertility and prosperity of the country round about. 



XXXVI. 

WAEMnSTG AKD VENTILATION. 

Thebe is no department of science, as applied to practical 
matters, which has so often baffled experimenters as the 
healthful mode of warraing and ventilating houses. The 
British nation spent over a million on the House of Parlia- 
ment for thib end, and failed. Our own government has 
spent half a million on the Capitol, with worse failure ; and 
now it is proposed to spend a million more. The reason is, 
that the old open fireplace has been supplanted by less ex- 
pensive modes of heating, destructive to health ; and science 
has but just begun experiments to secure a remedy for the 
evil. 

The open fire warms the person, the walls, the floors and 
the furniture by radiation, and these, together with the fire, 
warm the air by convection. For the air resting on the 
heated surfaces is warmed by convection, rises and gives 
place to cooler particles, causing a constant heating of its 
particles by movement. Thus in a room with an open fire, 
the person is warmed in part by radiation from the fire 
and the surrounding walls and fumittu-e, and in part by 
the warm air surrounding the body. 

In regard to the warmth of air, the thermometer is not 
an exact index of its temperature. For all bodies are con- 
stantly radiating their heat to cooler adjacent surfaces until 
all come to the same temperature. This being so, the 
thermometer is radiating its heat to walls and surrounding 
objects, in addition to what is subtracted by the air that 
surrounds it, and thus the air is really several degreeo 
warmer than the thermometer indicates. A room at 70° 



420 1'^^ HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

by the thermometer is usually filled with air five or more 
degrees warmer than this. 

Now, the cold air is denser than warm, and therefore 
contains more oxygen. Consequently, the cooler the air in- 
spired, the larger the supply of oxygen and of the vitality 
and vigor which it imparts. Thus, the great problem for 
economy of health is to warm tlie person as much as pos- 
sible by radiated heat, and supply the lungs with cool air. 
For when we breathe air at from 16° to 20°, we take doubly 
the amount of oxygen that we do when we inhale it at 80" 
to 90°, and consequently can do double the amount of muscle 
and brain work. 

"Warming by an open fire is nearest to the natural mode 
of the Creator, who heats the earth and its furnitui-e by the 
great central fire of heaven, and sends cool breezes for om 
lungs. But open fires involve great destruction of fuel 
and expenditure of money, and in consequence economic 
methods have been introduced to the great destruction of 
health and life. 

Of these methods, the most popular is that by which ra- 
diated heat is banished, and all warmth is gained by intro- 
ducing heated air. This is the method employed in our 
national Capitol, where both warming and ventilation are 
attempted by means of fans worked by steam, which force 
in the heated air. This is an expensive mode, used only 
for large establishments, and its entire failure at our capi- 
tol will probably prevent in future any very extensive use 
of it. 

But the most common mode of warming is by heated air 
introduced from a furnace. The chief objection to this is 
the loss of all radiated heat, and the consequent necessity 
of breathing air which is debilitating both from its heat and 
also from being usually deprived of the requisite moisture 
provided by the Creator in all out-door air. Another ob- 
jection is the fact that it is important to health to preserve 
an equal circulation of the blood, and the greatest impedi- 



WABMINa ANB VENTILATION. 421 

inent to this is a mode of heating which keeps the head in 
warmer air than the feet. This is especially deleterious in an 
age and country where activie brains are constantly drawing 
blood from the extremities to the head. All furnace- 
heated rooms have coldest air at the feet, and warmest 
around the head. It is also rarely the case that furnace- 
heated houses have proper an-angements for carrying off 
the vitiated air. 

There are some recent scientific discoveries that relate to 
impure aii- which may pi'operly be introduced here. It is 
shown by the microscope that fermentation is a process 
which generates extremely minute plants, that gradually 
increase till the whole mass is pervaded by this vegetation. 
The microscope also has revealed the fact that, in certain 
diseases, these microscopic plants are generated in the 
blood and other fluids of the body, in a mode similar ti- 
the ordinary process of fermentation. 

And, what is very curious, each of these peculiar dis 
eases generates diverse kinds of plants. Thus in the ty 
phdid fever, the microscope reveals in the fluids of the 
patient a plant that resembles in form some kinds of sea- 
weed. In chills and fever, the microscopic plant has an- 
other form, and in small-pox still another. A work has 
recently been published in Europe, in which representa- 
tions of these various microscopic plants generated in the 
fluids of the diseased persons are exhibited, enlarged seve- 
ral hundred times by the microscope. All diseases that 
exhibit these microscopic plants are classed together, and 
are called Zymotio, from a Greek word signifying to fer- 
ment. 

These zymotic diseases sometimes have a local origin, as 
in the case of ague caused by miasma of swamps; and 
then they are named endemic. In other cases, they are 
caused by persona^ contact with the diseased body or its 
clothing, as the itch or small-pox ; or else by effluvia from 
the sick, as in measles. Such are called contagious or infec- 



422 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

tious. In other cases, diseases result from some uaknown 
cause in the atmosphere, and affect numbers of people at 
the same time, as in influenza or scarlet fever, and these 
are called epidemics. 

It is now regarded as probable that most of these dis- 
eases are generated by the microscopic plants which float 
in an impure or miasmatic atmosphere, and are taken into 
the blood by breathing. 

Eecent scientific investigations ra Great Britain and 
other countries prove that the power of resisting these dis- 
eases depends upon the purity of the air which has been 
habitually inspired. The human body gradually accom- 
modates itself to unhealthful circumstances, so that people 
can live a long time in bad air. But the " reserve power'-' 
of the body, that is, the power of resisting disease, is under 
such circumstances gradually destroyed, and then an epi- 
demic easily sweeps away those thus enfeebled. The 
plague of London, that destroyed thousands every day, 
came immediately after a long period of damp, warm days, 
when there was no wind tq, carry off the miasma thus 
generated ; while the people, by long breathing of bad air, 
were all prepared, from having sunk into a low vitality, to 
faU before the pestilence. 

Multitudes of public documents show that the fatality 
of epidemics is always proportioned to the degree in which 
impure air has previously been respired. Sickness and 
death are therefore regulated by the degree in which air is 
kept pure, especially in' case of diseases in which medical 
treatment is most uncertain, as in cholera and malignant 
fevers. 

Investigations made by governmental authority, and by 
boards of health in this country and in Great Britain, prove 
that zymotic diseases ordinarily result from impure air 
generated by vegotab e or animal decay, and that in almost 
all cases they can be prevented by keeping the air pure. 
The decayed animal matter sent off from the skin and 



WABMING AND VENTUATION. 423 



lungs in a close, unventilated bedroom is one thing that 
generates these zymotic diseases. The decay of animal and 
vegetable matter in cellars, sinks, drains, and marshy dis- 
tricts is another cause ; and the decayed vegetable matter 
thrown up by plowing up of decayed vegetable matter in 
the rich soil in new countries is another. 

In the investigations made in certain parts of Great 
Britain, it appeared that in districts where the air is 
pure the deaths average 11 iu 1000' each year ; while in 
localities most exposed to impure miasma, the mortality 
was 45 in every thousand. Af this rate, thirty-four per- 
sons in every thousand died from poisoned air, who would 
have preserved health and life by well-ventilated homes in 
a pure atmosphere. And, out of all who died, the propor- 
tion who owed their deaths to foul air was more than three 
fourths. Similar facts have been obtained by boards of 
health in our OAvn country. 

Mr. Leeds gives statistics showing, that in Philadelphia, 
by improved modes of ventilation and other sanitary me- 
thods, there was a saving of 3237 lives in two years ; and 
a saving of three fourths of a million of dollars, which 
would pay the whole expense of the public schools. Phi- 
ladelphia being previously an unusually cleanly and well- 
ventilated city, what would be the saving of life, health, 
and wealth were such a city -as l^J"ew-York perfectly 
cleansed and ventilated? 

Here it is proper to state again that conflicting opinions 
are found in many writers on ventilation in regard to the 
position of ventilating registers to carry off vitiated air. 
Most writers state that the impure air is heavier, and falls 
to the bottom of a room. After consulting scientific men 
extensively on this point, the writer finds the true result 
to be as follows : Carbonic acid is heavier than common 
air, and, unmixed, falls to the floor. But by the principle 
ofdifusion of gases, the air thrown from the lungs, though 
at flrst it sinks a little, is gradually diffused, and in a heated 



424 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL.. 

room, in the majority of cases, it is found more abundant- 
ly at the top than at the bottom of the room, though m 
certain circumstances it is more at the bottom. For this 
reason, registers to carry off impure air should be placed at 
both the top and bottom of a room. 

In arranging for pure air in dwellings, it is needful to 
proportion the air admitted and discharged to~the number 
of persons. As a guide to this, we have the following cal- 
culation : On an average, every adult vitiates about half a 
pint of air at each inspiration, and inspires twenty times a 
minute. This would amount to one hogshead of air vitiated 
every hour by every grown person. To keep the air pure, 
this amount should enter and be carried out every hour 
for each person. If, then, ten persons assemble in a dining- 
room, ten hogsheads of air should enter and ten be dis- 
charged each hour. By the same rule, a gathering of five 
hundred persons demands the entrance and discharge of 
five hundred hogsheads of air every hour, and a thousand 
persons require a thousand hogsheads of air every hour. 

In calculating the size of registers and conductors, then, 
we must have reference to the number of persons who are 
to abide in a dwelling ; while for rooms or halls intended 
for large gatherings, a far greater allowance must be 
made. 

The most successful mode before the public, both for 
warming and ventilation, is that of Lewis Leeds, who was 
employed by government to ventilate the military hospi- 
tals and also the treasury building at Washington. This 
method has been adopted in various school-houses, and also 
by A. T. Stewart in his hotel for women in New-York 
City. The Leeds plan embraces the mode of heating both 
by radiation and convection, very much resembling the 
open fireplace in operation, and yet securing great econo- 
my. It is modeled striitly after the mode adopted by the 
Ci-eator in warming and ventilating the earth, the home of 
his great earthly family. It aims to have a passage of pure 



WARMING, AND VENTILATION. 425 

air through every room, as the breezes pass over the hills, 
and to have a method of warming chiefly hy radiation, as 
the earth is warmed by the sun. In addition to this, the 
air is to be provided with moisture, as it is supplied out- 
doors by exhalations from the earth and its trees and 
plants. 

The mode of accomplishing this is by placing coils of 
steam, or hot water pipes, under windows, which wai-m the 
parlor walls and furniture, partly by radiation, and partly 
by the air warmed on the heated surfaces of the coils. At 
the same time, by regulating registers, or by simply opening 
the lower part of the window, the pure air, guarded from 
immediate entrance into the room, is admitted directly 
upon the coils, so that it is partially wanned before it 
reaches the person : and thus' cold drafts are prevented. 
Then the vitiated air is dra,wn off through registers both 
at the top and bottom of the room, opening into a heated 
exhausting flue, through which the constantly ascending 
current of warm air carries it off. These heated coils are 
often used for warming houses without any arrangement 
for carrying off the vitiated air, when, of course, their pecu- 
liar usefulness is gone. 

The moisture may be supplied by a broad vessel placed 
on or close to the heated coils, giving a large surface for 
evaporation. When rooms are warmed chiefly by radiated 
heat, the air can be borne much cooler than in rooms warmed 
by hot-air furnaces, just as a person in the radiating sun can 
bear much cooler air than in the shade. A time will come 
when walls and floors will be contrived to radiate heat in 
stead of absorbing it from the occupants of houses, as is 
generally the case at the present time, and then all can 
breathe pure and cool air. 

We are now prepared to examine more in detail the 
modes of warming and ventilation employed in the dwell- 
ings planned for tliis work. 

In doing this, it should be remembered that the aim is not 



426 THE EOUSEKEEPPE'S MANUAL. 

to give pians of houses to suit the architectural taste or the 
domestic convenience of persons who intend to keep several 
servants, and care little whether they breathe pure or bad 
air, nor of persons -who do not wish to educate their children 
to manual industry or to habits of close economy. 

On the contrary, the aim is, first, to secure a house in 
which every room shall be perfectly ventilated both day and 
night, and that too vnthout the watchful care and constant 
attention and intelligence needful in houses not provided 
with a proper and successful mode of ventilation. 

The next aim is, to arrange the conveniences of domestic 
labor so as to save time, and also to render such work less 
repulsive than it is made by common methods, so that chil- 
dren can be trained to love house-work. And lastly, econo- 
my of expense in house-btiilding is sought. These things 
should be borne in mind in examining the plans of this 
work. 

In the Cottage plan, (Chap II. Fig. 1,) the pure air for 
rooms on the ground floor is to be introduced by a wooden 
conductor one foot square, running under ,the jloor ffom 
the front door to the stove-room ; with cross branches to 
the two large rooms. The pure air passes through this, 
protected outside by wire netting, and delivered inside 
through registers in each room, as indicated in Fig. 1. 

In case open Franklin stoves are used in the large rooms, 
the pure air from the conductor should enter behind them, 
and thus be partially warmed. The vitiated air is carried 
off at the bottom of the room through the open stoves, and 
also at the top by a register opening into a conductor to the 
exhausting warm-air shaft, which, it will be remembered, 
is the square chimney, containing the iron pipe which re- 
ceives the kitchen stove-pipe. The stove-room receives pxu-e 
air from the conductor, and sends off impure air and the 
smells of cooking by a register opening directly into the 
exhausting shaft ; while its hot* air and smoke, passing 
through the iron pipe, heat the air of the shaft, and produce 



WARMING AND VENTILATION. 42'J 

the exhausting current. The construction of the exhausting 
or warm-air shaft is described on page 63. 

The large chambers on the second floor (Fig. 12) have 
pure air conducted from the stove-room through registers 
that can be closed if the heat or smells of cooking are un- 
pleasant. The air in the stove-room will always be moist 
from the water of the stove boiler. 

The small chambers have pure air admitted from windows 
sunk at top half an inch ; and the warm, vitiated air is con-, 
ducted by a register in the ceiling which opens inio a con- 
ductor to the exhausting wann-air shaft at the centre of the 
house, as shown in Fig. 17. 

The basement or cellar is ventilated by an opening into 
the exhausting air shaft, to remove impure air, and a small 
opening over each glazed door to admit pure air. The doors 
open out into a " well," or recess, excavated in the earth 
before the cellar, for the admission of light and air, neatly 
bricked up and whitewashed. The doors are to be made 
entirely of strong, thick glass sashes, and this will give light 
enough for laundry work ; the tubs and ironing-table being 
placed close to the glazed door. The floor must be plas- 
tered with water-lime, and the walls and ceiling be white- 
. washed, which will add reflected light to the room. There 
will thus be no need of other windows, and the house 
need not be raised above the ground. Several cottages have 
been built thus, so that the ground floors and conservatories 
are nearly on the same level ; and all agree that they are 
pleasanter than when raised higher. 

When a window in any room is sunk at the top, it should 
have a narrow shelf In front inclined to the opening, so as 
to keep out the rain. In small chambers for one person, an 
inch opening is sufficient, and in larger rooms for two per- 
sons, a two-inch opening is needed. The openings into the 
exhausting air flue should vary from eight inches to twelve 
inches square, or more, according to the munber of persons 
who are to sleep in the room. 



428 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

The time when ventilation is most difficult is tnemediiiTG 
weather in spring and fall, when the air, though damp, is 
similar in temperature outside and in. Then the warm-air 
flue is indispensable to proper ventilation. This is especially 
needed in a room used for school or church purposes. 

Every room used for large numbers should have its air 
regulated not only as to its' warmth and purity, but also as 
to its supply of moisture ; and for this purpose vtIU be found 
very convenient the instrument called the Hygrodeik,* 
which shows at once the temperature and the moisture. A 
work by Dr. Derby on Anthracite Coal, scientific men say 
has done much mischief by an unproved theory that the dis- 
comfort of furnace heat is caused by the passage of car- 
bonic oxide through the iron of the f m-nace heaters, and not 
by want of moisture. God made the air right, and taking 
out its moisture must be wi'ong. 

The preceding remarks illustrate the advantages of the 
cottage plan in respect to ventilation. The' economy of 
the mode of warming next demands attention. In the first 
place, it should be noted that the chimney being at the 
centre of the house, no heat is lost by its radiation through 
outside walls into open air, as is the ease with all fireplaces 
and grates that have their backs and flues joined to an out- 
side wall. . 

In this plan, all the radiated heat from the stove serve^ 
to warm the walls of adjacent rooms in cold weather ; while 
in the warm season, the non-conducting summer casings of 
the stove send all the heat not used in cooking either into 
the exhausting warm-air shaft or into the central cast-iron 
pipe. In addition to this, the sliding doors of the stove-room 
(which should be only six feet high, meeting the partition 
coming from the ceiling) can be opened in cool days, and 
then the heat from the stove would temper the rooms each 
side of the kitchen. In hot weather, they could be kept

closed except when the stove is used, and then opened only 
for a short thne. The Franklin stoves in the large room 
would give the radiating warmth and cheerM blaze of an 
open fire, while radiating heat also from all their surfaces. 
In cold weather, the air of the larger chambers could be 
tempered by registers admitting warm air from the stove- 
room, which would always be sufficiently moistened Ijy 
evaporation from the stationary boiler. The conservato- 
ries in winter, protected from frost by double sashes, would 
contribute agreeable moisture to the larger rooms. In case 
the size of a family required more rooms, another story 
could be ventilated and warmed by the same mode, with 
little additional expense. 

We wiU next notice the economy of time, labor, and 
expense secured by this cottage plan. The laundfy work 
being done in the basement, all the cooking, dish-washing, 
etc., can be done in the kitchen and stove-room on the 
ground floor. But in case a larger kitchen is needed, the 
lounges can be put in the front part of the large room, and 
the movable screen placed so as to give a work-room adja- 
cent to the kitchen, and the front side of the same be used 
for the eating-room. Where the movable screen is used, 
the floor should be oiled wood. A square piece of carpet dan 
be put in the centre of the front part of the room, to keep 
the feet warm when sitting around the table, and small 
rugs can be placed before the lounges or other sitting-places, 
for the same purpose. 

Most cottages are so divided by entries, stairs, closets, 
etc., that there can be no large rooms. But in this plan, 
by the use of the movable screen, two fine large rooms can 
be secured whenever the family work is over, while the 
conveniences for work will very much lessen the time 
required. 

In certain cases, where the closest economy is needful, 
two small families can occupy the cottage, by having a 
movable screen in both rooms, and using the kitchen in 



.130 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

common, or divide it and have two smaller stoves. Each 
kitchen will then have a window and as much room as is 
given to the kitchen in great steamers that provide for 
several hundred. 

Whoever plans a house with a view to economy must 
arrange rooms around a central chimney, and avoid all pro- 
jecting appendages. Dormer windows are far more ex 
pensive than common ones, and are less pleasant. Every 
addition projecting from a main building greatly increases 
expense of building, and still more of warming and venti- 
lating. 

It should be introduced, as one school exercise in every 
female seminary, to plan houses with reference to economy 
of time, labor, and expense, and also with reference to good 
architectural taste ; and the teacher should be qualified to 
point out faults and give the instruction needed to prevent 
such mistakes in practical life. Every girl should be 
trained to be "a wise woman" that "buildeth her house" 
aright. 

There is but one mode of ventilation yet tried, that will, 
at all seasons of the year and all hours of the day and 
night, secure pure air without dangerous draughts, and that 
is by an exhausting warm-air flue. This is always secured 
by an open fireplace, so long as its chimney is kept warm 
by any fire. And in many cases, a fireplace with a flue qi 
a certain dimension and height will secure good ventilation 
except when the air without and within are at the same 
temperature. 

When no exhausting warm-air flue can be used, the 
opening of doors and windows is the only resort. Every 
sleeping-room without a fireplace that draws smoke well 
should have a window raised at the bottom or sunk at the 
top at least an inch, with an inclined shelf outside or in, to 
keep out rain, and then it is properly ventilated. Or a 
door should be kept opened into a hall with an open win- 
dow. Let the bed-clothing be increased, so as to keep warm 



WASHONO AND VENTILATION. 431 

in bed, and protect the head also, and then the more air 
comes into a sleeping-room the better for health. 

In reference to the warming of rooms and houses already 
built, there is no doubt' that stoves are the most economi- 
cal mode, as they radiate heat and also warm by convec- 
tion. The grand objection to their use is the diiiiculty of 
securing proper ventilation. If a room is well warmed by 
a stove and then a suitable opening made for the entrance 
of a good supply of out-door air, and by a mode that will 
prevent dangerous draughts, all is right as to pure air. 
But in this case, the feet are always on cold floors, sur- 
rounded by the coldest air, while the head is in air of 
much higher temperature. 

There is a great difference as to healthfiilness and econo- 
my in the, great variety of stoves with which the market is 
filled. The competition in this manufacture is so strin- 
gent, and so many devices are employed by agents, that 
there is constant and enormous imposition on the public 
and an incredible outlay on poor stoves, that soon burn 
out or break, while they devour fuel beyond calculation. 
If some benevolent and scientific organization could be 
formed that would, fi"om disinterested motives, afford some 
reliable guidance to the public, it probably would save 
both millions of money and much domestic discomfort. 

The stove described in Chapter V. is protected by pa- 
tents in its chief advantages, but this has not restrained 
many of the trade from incorporating some of its leading 
excellencies and claiming to have added superior elements. 
Others will inform any who inquire for it, that it is out of 
market, because later stoves have proved superior. Should 
any who read this work wish to be sure of securing this 
stove, and also of gaining minute directions for its use, they 
may apply to the writer. Miss C. E. Beecher, 69 West 38th 
Street, New-York, inclosing 25 cents.

tive circulars, and her own advice as to the best selection

from the different sizes, and directions for its use, based on 
her own personal experience and that of many friends. 
Should any purchases be made through this medium, the 
manufacturers have agreed to pay a certain percentage 
into the treasury of the Benevolent Association mentioned 
at the close of this volume. 

There is no more dangerous mode of heating a room 
than by a gas-stove. < There is inevitably more or less 
leakage of the gas which it is unhealthful to breathe. 
Ahd proper ventilation is scarcely ever secured by those 
who use such stoves. The same fatal elements of imper- 
fect ventilation with its attendant horrors of disease, ex- 
travagant wastefulness of material, of fuel, of labor, of 
time, and of destruction to the apparatus itself, seem con- 
comitants of all ordinary stoves and cooking arrangements 
of the present day, unless those who use them are constant 
and unretaiitting in the exercise of intelligent watchfalness, 
guarding against these evils. And in view of the almost 
inevitable stupidity and carelessness of servants, who gen- 
erally have charge of such things, and the frequent 
thoughtlessness even of intelligent women who manage 
their own kitchens, the writer believes she is doing a pub- 
lic service by offering her own experience as a guide to 
simpler, cheaper, and more wholesome means of living and 
preparing the family food. 



THE HOUSEKEEPEE'S MANUAL. 

Part II. 
THE HANDY COOK-BOOK. 



I. 

HEALTH, ECONOMY, AND PLEASUEE, IN FOOD. 

The following are the special advantages of the following 
pages : 

The directions for preparing and cooking food provide a 
large variety of articles which, according to all medical and 
physiological rules, are healthful. 

There is also a good variety of dishes which are economical. 

There are unusual contrivances for saving time and labor in 
cooking, having special reference to women of culture in new 
settlements, who have few conveniences, poor markets, and 
either poor servants or none at all. 

As the relish of food depends chiefly on the proper season- 
ings and flavors, there are more specific methods given than 
the ordinary rule, " season to the taste," which leaves all to the 
judgment of the careless or the ignorant. 

The recipes are put in short arul clear language, so as to be 
easily read and understood by servants, and also more readily 
remembered. 

These recipes and directions have been criticised arid tested 
by some of the best housekeepers of all sections of the nation. 

RULES OF HEALTH IN EEGABD TO FOOD AND DEINK. 

Always eat slowly and chew very thoroughly, as this greatly 
aids digestion. 

Do not eat between meals, because this mixes the partly 
digested food" with the new supply, and impedes digestion. 



434 THE HOUSEKEEPEI^ S MANUAL. 

Meals should be about five hours apart, to give the stomach 
time to rest after the labor of the muscles in digestion. 

Do not eat too much, as this tends to indigestion and taxes 
the organs that must labor to throw off the excess. A health- 
ful appetite is a safe guide, if meals are at regular and jsroper 
periods, the food simple, and nothing is taken after hunger is 
satisfied. Successive dishes of food are unwise for children and 
invalids, tempting them to eat too much. Children should 
have the kind of food they like best, if it is healthful, and 
should make their whole meal of it. Soups, and then meats, 
and then tempting desserts, are very dangerous to the young 
and the delicate, who have formed no habits of self-control, or 
are ignorant of their dangers. 

Do not require children to eat what they do not relish, as it 
is proved by many experiments that food which is relished is 
better digested and more healthful than that which is not. 
This shows the importance of care in seasoning food properly, 
and of rules to aid in so doing. 

Do not multiply dishes for one meal, but rather have a 
variety at successive meals ; for digestion is easier and more 
perfect when there are but few articles taken at ohe meal, ana 
grows more diificult as the variety increases. 

Food and drinks should not be very hot, as this tends to de- 
stroy the teeth. 

Drink moderately while eating — one tumbler or tea-cuptui 
only. If thirsty, drink freely before eating. 

Do not drink very cold water or take ices after a full meal, 
as cooling the stomach lessens the power of digestion. 

Do not drink tea or coffee, except when so largely diluted as 
not to stimulate. It will be found that a gradual diminution 
of strength in these drinks will modify one's taste, so that after 
a few months, weak dilutions will be relished as much as 
strong. An expert housekeeper can change dangerous habits 
in this way with little trouble, and sometimes without notice 
by those benefited. 

Be careful to have pure water to drink, as most important to 
health. If water is impure, filter it through sand and powdered 
charcoal. The free drinking of pure, cold water before meals 



BEALTB, ECONOMY, AND PLEASURE, IN FOOD. 435 

is healthful, tending to purify the blood, strengthen the sto- 
mach, and thus promoting digestion. 

In using salt and pepper, diversities of strength make a diffi- 
culty in giving very exact directions ; so also do inequalities in 
the size of spoons and tumblers. But so much can be done 
that a housekeeper, after one trial, can give exact directions to 
her cook, or with a pencil alter the recipe. 

It is a great convenience to have recipes that employ mea- 
sures which all families have on hand, so as not to use steel- 
yards and balances. The following will be found the most 
convenient : 

A medium size tearspoon, even full, equals 60 drops or one eighth of an 
ounce. 

A medium size table-spoon, even full, equals two tea-spoonfuls. 

One ounce equals eight even tea-spoonfuls, or four table-spoonfuls. 

One gill equals eight even table-spoonfuls. 

Half a gill equals four even table-spoonfuls. 

Two gills equal half a pint, and four gills equal one pint. 

One common size tumbler equals half a pint, or two gills. 

One pint equals two tumblerfuls, or four gills. 

One quart equals four tumblerfuls, or eight gills. 

Four quarts equal one gallon. 

Four gallons equal one peck. 

Four pecks equal one bushel. 

A quart of sifted flour, heaped, a sifted quart of sugar, and' a softened 
quart of butter each weigh about a pound, and so nearly that measuring 
is as good as weighing. 

Water is heavier, and a pint of water weighs nearly a pound. 

Ten eggs <veigh about one pouno. 



II. 

MAEKETISTG AND THE CAEE OF MEATS. 

EvEET young woman, at some period of her life, may need 
the instructions of this chapter. Thousands will have the im- 
mediate care of buying meats for the family ; and even those 
who are not themselves obliged to go to market, should have 
the knowledge which will enable them to direct their servants 
what and how to buy, and to judge whether the household, 
under their management, is properly served or not. Nothing 
so thoroughly insures the intelligent obedience of orders, as 
evidence that the person ordering knows exactly what is wanted. 

The directions given in this and the ensuing chapters on 
meats, were carefully written, first in Cincinnati, with the 
counsel and advice of business men practically engaged in 
such matters. They have been recently rewritten in Hartford, 
Conn., after consultation with intelligent butchers and grocers. 

MARKETING. 



The animal, when slaughtered, should be bled very thorough- 
ly. The care taken by the Jews in this and other points draws 
custom from other sects to their markets. The skin is tanned 
for leather, and the fat is used for candles and other purposes. 
The tail is used for soups, and the liver, heart, and tripe are also 
used for cooking. The body is split into two parts, through 
the back-bone, and each half is divided as marked in the draw- 
ing above. There are diverse modes of cutting and naming 
the parts, butchers in New-England, in New- York, in the 
South, and in the West, all making some slight differences ; 
but the following is the most common method. 



iLABKHTINa AND THB CAS.E OF MEATS.

437 




1. The head : frequently used for mince-pies ; sometimes it is tried up 
for oil, and tlien the bones are used for fertilizers. The horns are used 
to make buttons and combs, and various other things. 3. The neck ; 
used for soups and stews. 3. The chuck-rib, or shovlder, having four ribs. 
It is used for corning, stews, and soup, and some say the best steaks are 
from this piece. 4. The front of the shoulder, or the shoulder-clod, which 
is sometimes called the hrisket. 5. The hack of the shoulder ; used for 
corning, soups, and stews. 6. The fore-shin, or leg ; used for soups. 7, 
7. The plate-pieces ; the front one is called the brisket, (as is also 4,) and 
is used for corning, soups, and stews. The back plate-piece is called the 
jlank, and is divided into the thick flank, or upper sirloin, and the lower 
fiank. These are for roasting and corning. 8. The standing ribs, di- 
vided into first, second, and third cuts ; used for roasting. The second 
cut is the best of the three. 9. The sirloin, which is the best roasting 
piece. 10. The mrloin steak and the porter-house steak ; used for broil- 
ing. 11. The rump, or aiteli-bone ; used for soup or corning, or to cook 
a la mode. 12. The round, or buttock ; used for corning, or for a la mode ; 
also for dried beef. 13. The liock, or hind sliank ; iised for soups. 

In selecting -Bee/", choose that which has a loose grain, easily- 
yielding to pressure, of a clear red, with whitish fat. If the 
lean is purplish, and the fat yellow, it is poor beef. Beef long 
kept turns a darker color than fresh killed. Stall-fed beef has 
a lighter color than grass-fed. 

Ox beef is the best, and next, that of a heifer. 

In cold weather, it is economical to buy a hind quarter ; have 
it cut up, and what is not wanted immediately, pack with snow 
in a barrel. All meat's grow tender by keeping. Do not let 
meats freeze ; if they do, thaw them in cold water, and do not

cook it till fully thawed. A piece -weighing ten pounds requires 
ten or twelve hours to thaw.

The calf should not be slaughtered until it is six weeks old. 
Spring is the best time for veal. It is divided as marked in 
the drawing. 

1. The liead, Bold with tlie pluck, which includes the Jiea/rt, liver, and 
sweet-breads. 3. The rack, including the neck ; used for stews, pot-pies, 
and broths ; also for chops and roasting. 3. The shoulder. This, and 
also half the rack and ribs of the fore-quarter, are sometimes roasted, and 
sometimes xised for stews, broths, and cutlets. 4. The fore-shank, or 
knuckle; used for broths. 5. The breast; used for stewa and soups; 
also to stuff and bake. 6. The loin ; used for roasting. 7. The fiUet, or 
leg, including the hind flank ; used for cutlets, or to stuff and boil, or to 
stuff and roast, or bake. 8. The hind shank, or Jiock, or knuckle ; used 
for soups. The feet SiXe used for jelly. 

In selecting Veal, take that which is firm and dry, and the 
joints stifl^ having the lean a delicate red, the kidney covered 
with fat, and the fat very white. If you buy the head, see that 
the eyes are plump and lively, and not dull and sunk in the 
head. If you buy the legs, get those which are not skinned, as 
the skin is good for jelly or soup.

MUTTON. 

1. The shoulder ; for boiling or corning. 3, 3. The neck and rack ; for 
boiling or coming. 3. The loin ; is roasted, or broiled as chops. 4. The 
leg; is boiled, or broiled, or stuffed and roasted. Many salt and smoke 
the leg, and call it smoked venison. 5. The hreaat ; for boiling or 
corning. 

In choosing Mutton, take that which is bright red and close- 
grained, with firm and white fat. The meat should feel ten- 
der and springy on pressure. Notice the vein on the neck of 
the fore-quarter, which should be a fine blue.

1. The Z«5', or Mire ; used for smoking. 3 TheJiindloin. 3. The /oris, 
lin. 4. The spare^ib ; for roasting ; sometimes including all the ribs. 
J. The Tiand, or alioulder ; sometimes smoked, and sometimes corned and 
boiled. 6. The heUy, or spring, for corning or salting down. The feet 
are used for jelly, headcheese, and souse. 

In selecting I'ork, if young, the lean can be easily broken 
when pinched, and the skin can be indented by nipping with 
the fingers. The fat also will be white and soft. Thin rind is 
best. 



440 THE BOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

In selecting Sams, run a knife along the bone, and if it comes 
out clean, the ham is good ; but if it comes out smeared, it is 
spoiled. Good bacon has white fat, and the lean adheres close- 
ly to the bone. If the bacon has yellow streaks, it is rusty, and 
not fit to use. 



In selecting Poultry, choose those that are full grown, but 
not old. When young and fresh-killed, the skin is thin and 
tender, the joints not very stiff, and the eyes full and bright. The 
breast-bone shows the age, as it easily yields to pi-essure if 
young, and is tough when old. If young, you cau Avith a pin 
easily tear the skiii. A goose, when old, has red and hairy 
legs ; but when young, they are yellow, and have few hairs. 
The pin-feathers are the roots of feathers, which wreak ofi" and 
remain in the skin, and always indicate a young bird. When 
very neatly dressed, they are pulled out. 

Poultry and birds ought to be killed by having the head cut 
off, and then hung up by tlie legs to bleed freely. This makes 
the flesh white and more healthful. 



In selecting Fish, take those that are firm and thick, having 
stiff fins and bright scales, the gills bright red, and the eyes full 
and prominent. When fish are long out of water, they grow 
soft, the fins bend easily, the scales are dim, the gills grow 
dark, and the eyes sink and shrink away. Be sure and have' 
them dressed immediately ; sprinkle then\ with salt, and use 
them, if possible, the same day. In warm weather, put them in 
ice, or corning, for the next day. 

Shell-fish can be decided upon only by the smell. Lobsters 
are not good unless alive, or else boiled before offered for sale. 
They are black when alive, and red when boiled. When to be ' 
boiled, they are to be put alive into boiling water, which is the 
quickest and least cruel way to end their life. 



MARKETING AND THE CARE OF MEATS. 441 

THE CARE OF MEATS. 

In hot -weather, if there is no refrigerator, then wipe meat 
dry, sprinlde on a little salt and pepper, and hang in the cellar. 
Or, still better, wrap it, thus prepared, in a dry cloth, and cover 
it with charcoal or with wood-ashes. Mutton, wrapped in a 
cloth wet with vinegar, and laid on the ground of a dry cellar, 
keeps well and improves in tenderness. 

Hang meat a day or two after it is killed before corning it. 

In winter, meat is kept finely if well packed in snow, without 
salting ; but some say it lessens the sweetness. 

Frozen meat must be thawed in cold water, and not cooked 
tUl entirely thawed. 

Beef and mutton are improved by keeping as long as they 
remain sweet. If meat begins to taint, wash it and rub *t with 
powdered charcoal, which it often removes the taint. Some- 
times rubbing with salt will cure it. Soda water is good also. 

Take all the kernels out that you will find in the round, and 
thick end of the flank of beef, and in the fat, and fill the holes 
with salt. This will preserve it longer. 

Salt your meat, in summer, as soon as you receive it. 

A pound and a half of salt rubbed into twenty-five pounds 
of beef, will corn it so as to last several days in ordinary v/^arm 
weather; or put it in strong brine. 

In most books of recipes there are several different ones for 
coming, for curing pork hams, and for other uses, while an in- 
experienced person is at a loss to know which is best. The re- 
cipes here given are decided to be the best, after an examination 
of quite a variety, by the writer, who has resided where they 
were used ; and she knows that the very best results are secured 
by these directions. These also are pronounced the best by 
busmess men of large experience. 

To Salt down Beef to keep the Tear round.— One liundred pounds 
of beef ; four quarts of rock-salt, pounded fine ; four ounces of saltpetre, 
pounded fine ; four pounds of brown sugar. Mix well. Put a layer of 
meat on the bottom of the barrel, with a thin layer of this mixture under 
it. Pack the meat in layers, and between each put equal proportions of 
this mixture, allowing a little more to the top layers. Then pour in 
brine till the barrel is full. 



442 THE housekeeper's MANUAL. 

To cleanse Calf's Head and Feet. — Wasli clean, and sprinkle pound- 
ed resin over tlie hair ; dip in boiling water and take out immediately, 
and then scrape them clean ; then soak them in water for four days, 
changing the water every day. 

To prepare Rennet. — Take the stomach of a new-killed calf, and do 
not wash it, as it weakens the gastric juice. Hang it in a cool and dry 
place five days or so ; then turn the inside out, and slip off the curds 
with the hand. Then fill it with salt, with a little saltpetre mixed in, 
and lay it in a stone pot, pouring on a tea-spoonful of vinegar, and sprink- 
ling on a handful of salt. Cover it closely, and keep for use. After six 
weeks, take a piece four inches square and put it in a bottle with fiv^ gills 
ot cold water and two gills of rose brandy ; stop it close, and shake it 
when you use it. A. table-spoonful is enough for a quart of milk. 

To salt down Fish. — Scale, cut off the heads, open down the back, and 
remove most of the spine, to have them keep bt-tter. Lay them in salt 
water two hours, to extract blood. Sprinkle with fine salt, and let them 
lie over night. Then mix one peck of coarse and fine salt, one ounc6 of 
saltpetre, (or half an ounce of saltpetre and half an ounce of saleratus,) 
and one pound of sugar. Then pack in a firkin. Begin with a layer of 
salt, then a layer of fish, skin downward. A peck of salt will answer for 
twenty-five shad, and other fish in proportion. 

As in most country faniilies, when meat is salted for the 
year's use, pork is the meat most generally and most largely 
relied upon, considerable space is devoted to its proper prepa- 
ration. Special attention is given to various modes of curing 
and preserving it. 

To try out Lard. — Take what is called the leaves, and take off all the 
skin, cut it into pieces an inch square, put it into a clean pot over a slow 
fire, and try it till the scraps look a reddish-brown, taking great care not 
to let it burn, which would spoil the whole. Then strain it through a 
strong cloth, into a stone pot, and set it away for use. 

Take the fat to which the smaller intestines are attached, (not the 
large ones,) and the fiabby pieces of pork not fit for salting, try these in 
the same way, and set the fat thus obtained where it will freeze, and by 
spring the strong taste will be gone, and then it can be used for frying. 
A tea-cup of water prevents burning while trying. 

Corn-fed pork is best. Pork made by still-house slops is al- 
most poisonous, and hogs that live on offal never furnish health- 
ful food. If hogs are properly fed, the pork is not unhealthful. 



MARKETING AND. THE CARE OF MEATS. 443 

Pork with kernels in it is measly, and is unwholesome. 

A thick skin shows that the pork is old, and that it requires 
more time to boil. If bought pork is very salt, soak it some 
hours. Do not let pork freeze, if you intend to salt it. 

The gentleman who uses the following recipe for curing pork 
hams, says it has these advantages over all others he has tried 
or heard of, namely, the hams thus cured are sweeter than by 
any other method ; they are more solid and tender, and are 
cured in less than half the time. Moreover, they do not attract 
flies so much as other methods : 



Recipe for Molasses-cnred Hams. — Moisten every part of the liam 
witli molasses, and then for every hundred pounds use on-e quart of fine 
salt and four ounces of saltpetre, rubbing them in very thoroughly at 
every point. Put the hams thus prepared in a tight cask for four days. 
Then rub again with molasses and one quart of salt, and return the hams 
to the cask for four days. Repeat this the third and the fourth time, 
and then smoke the hams. This process takes only sixteen days, while 
other methods require five or six weeks. 

The following is the best recipe for the ordinary mode of 
curing hams ; and the brine or pickle thus prepared is equally 
good for coming and all other purposes for which brine is 
used. Some persons use saleratus instead of the saltpetre, ajid 
others use half and half of each, and say it is an improvement : 

Brine or Pickle for corning Hams, Beef, Pork, and Hun^ Beef. 

— Four gallons of water ; two pounds of rock-salt, and a little more of 
common salt ; two ounces of saltpetre ; one quart of molasses. Mix, but 
do not boil. Put the hams in a barrel and pour this over them, and 
keep them covered with I for six weeks. If more brine is needed, make 
it in the same proportions. 

Brine for Beef, Pork, Tongues, and Hung Beef.— Four gallons of 
water ; one and a half pounds of sugar ; one ounce of saltpetre ; one 
ounce of saleratus. Add salt ; a id if it is for use only a month or two, 
use six pounds of salt ; if for all the year, use nine pounds. In hot 
weather, rub the meat with salt before putting it in, and let it lie for 
three hours, to extract the blood. When tongues and hung beef are taken 
out, wash the 'pieces, and, when smoked, put them in paper bags, and 
hang in a dry place. 



444 THE SOUSEKJEEPER S MANUAL. 

Brine by Measure, easily made. — One gallon of cold water ; one 
quart of rock-salt, and two of blown salt ; one heaping table-spoonful of 
saltpetre, (or half as much of saleratus, with half a table-spoonful of salt- 
petre ;) six heaping table-spoonfuls of brown sugar. Mix, but not boil. 
Keep it as long as salt remains undissolved at bottom. When scum 
rises, add more salt, sugar, saltpetre, and soda. 

To salt down Pork. — Allow a peck of salt for sixty pounds. Cover 
the bottom of the barrel with salt an inch deep. Put down one layer of 
pork, and cover that with salt half an inch thick. Continue thus till the 
barrel is full. Then pour in as much strong brine as the barrel will re- 
ceive. Keep coarse salt between all pieces, so that the brine can circu- 
late. When a white scum or bloody -looking matter rises on the top, 
Bcald the brine and add more salt. Leave out bloody and lean pieces for 
sausages. Pack as tight as possible, the rind next the barrel ; and let it 
be always kept under the brine. Some use a stone for this purpose. In 
salting down a new supply, take the old brine, boil it down and remove 
all the scum, and then use it to pour over the pork. The pork may be 
used in six weeks after salting. 

To prepare Cases for Sausages.— Empty the cases, taking care not 
to tear them. Wash them thoroughly, and cut into lengths of two yards 
each. Then take a candle-rod, and fastening one end of a case to the top 
of it, turn the case inside outward. When all are turned, wash very 
thoroughly, and scrape them with a scraper made for the purpose, keep- 
ing them in warm water till ready to scrape; Throw them into salt and 
water to soak till used. It is a very difficult job to scrape them clean 
without tearing them. When finished, they look transparent and very 
thin. 

Sausage-Meat. — Take one third fat and two thirds lean pork, and 
chop It ; and then to every twelve pounds of meat add twelve large even 
spoonfuls of pounded salt, nine of sifted sage, and six of sifted black pep- 
per. Some like a little summer-savory. Keep it in a cool and dry place. 

Another Recipe. — To twenty-five pounds of chopped meat, which 
should be one third fat and two thirds lean, put twenty spoonfuls of sage, 
twenty-five of salt, ten of pepper, and four of summer-savory. 

Bologna Sausages. — Take equal portions of veal, pork, and ham ; 
chop them fine ; season with sweet herbs and pepper ; put them in cases ; 
boil them till tender, and then dry them. 

To Smoke Hams. — Make a small building of boards, nailing strips 
over the cracks to confine the smoke. Have within cross-sticks, on which 



MARKETING AND THE CARE OF MEATS.

to hang the hams. Have only one opening at top, at the end furthest 
from the fire. Set it up so high that a small stove can be set under 
or very near it, with the smoke-pipe entering the floor at the opposite 
end from the slide. These directions are for a wooden house, and it is 
better thus than to have a fire mthin a brick house, because too much 
warmth lessens the flavor and tenderness of the hams. Change the posi- 
tion of the hams once or twice, tht, all are treated alike. When this 
can not be done, use an inverted barrel or hogshead, with a hole for the 
smoke to escape, and resting on stones ; and keep a small, smouldering 
fire. Cobs are best) as giving a better' flavor ; and brands or chips of 
walnut wood are next best. Keeping a small fire a longer time is better 
than quicker smoking, as too much heat gives the hams a strong taste, 
and they are less sweet. 
The house and barrel are shown in Pig. 75, which follows :

STEWS AND SOtrPS. 

The most economical modes of cooking, as to time, care, and 
labor, are stews, soups, and hashes ; and when prpperly sea- 
soned, they are great favorites, especially with children. 

Below is a drawing of a stew and soup-kettle that any tin- 
man can easily make. Its advantages are that, after the meat is 
put in, there is no danger of scorching, and no watching is re- 
quired, except to keep up the fire aright, so as to have a steady 
simmering. Another advantage is that, by the tight cover, the 
steam and flavors are confined, and the cooking thus improved. 
Then, in taking up the stew, it offers several conveniences, as 
will be found on trial. 

Fig. 76. 




This stew-kettle consists of two pans, the inner one not 
fastened but fitting tight to the outer, with holes the size of a 
large pin-head commencing half an inch from the bottom and 
continuing to within two inches of the top of the under pan. 
It has a flat lid, on which may be placed a weight, to confine 
steam and flavors. The holes may be an inch apart. The size 



STSWS AND SOUPS. 447 

of the kettle miist depend on the size of the family ; it may- 
be of any desired size. 



GENEEAl DIEBOTIONS. 

Generally, in making stews, use soft water ; but when only 
hard is at hand, put in half a tea-spoonful of soda to every two 
quarts of water. Put in all the bones ai^d gristle first, break- 
ing the bones thoroughly. 

Rub fresh meat with salt, and put it in cold water, for soups, 
as this extracts the juices. 

As soon as water begins to boil, skim repeatedly till no more 
scum rises. 

Never let water boil hard for soups or stews ; for 

" Meat fast boiled 
Is meat lialf spoiled." 

Let the water simmer gently and not stop simmering long, 
as this injures both looks and flavor. 

Keep in water enough to cover the meat, or it becomes 
hard and dark. 

In preparing for soups, it is best to make a good deal of 
broth at one time ; cool it slowly, first removing sediment by 
straining through a colander. When cold, remove the fat 
from the top, and keep the liquor for soups and gravies. This 
is called stock, and as such should have no other seasonmg 
than salt. The other seasoning is to be put in when heated 
and combined with other material for soup. 

In hot weather, stock will keep only a day or two ; but in 
cool weather, three or four days. If vegetables were boiled in 
it, it will turn sour sooner. 

Remnants of cooked meats may be used together for soup ; 
but take care that none is tainted, thus spoiling all. Liquor 
in which corned beef is boiled should be saved to mix with 
stock of fresh meat, and then little or no salt is needed. The 
recipes for stews that follow will make good soups by addmg 
more water. 



448 THU BOUSEKEEPSR^ S MANUAL. 

Beef and Potato Stew.— Cut up four pounds of beef into strips three 
inclies by two, ^nd put them into two quarts of water, with one onion 
sliced very fine. Let this siniTOer four hours. Add in half a cup of warm 
water six even tea-spoonfuls of salt, three of sugar, three of vinegar, 
a tea-spoonful of black pepper^ and six heaping tea-spoonfuls of flour, 
' lumps rubbed out. Pour these upon the meat ; cut up, slice, and add six 
potatoes, and let all stew till the meat is very tender, and the potatoes are 
soft. If potatoes are omitted, leave out half a tea-spoonful of salt and a 
pinch of the pepper. 

Be sure and skim very thoroughly when boiling commences, and do 
not allow hard boiling, but only a gentle simmer. 

French Mutton and Turnip Stew. — Cut up two pounds of mutton, with 
a little of the fat, into two-inch squares. Rub two heaping table-spoon- 
fuls of butter into two table-spoonfuls of flour, and stir it into the meat, 
with water just enough to cover it. Add three even tea-spoonfuls of salt, 
half a one of pepper, four of sugar, a sprig of parsley, and a small onion, 
sliced very fine. Skim, as soon as it begins to boil, and then add thirty 
pieces of turnips, each an inch square, that have been fried brown. Let 
all stew till meat and turnips are tender ; throw out the parsley, and 
serve with the turnips in the centre, and the meat around it. 

A Simple Mutton Stew. — Cut four pounds of mutton into two-inch 
squares, add four even tea-spoonfuls of salt, four of sugar, half a one of 
pepper, and a, small onion, sliced fine. Stew three hours, and thtn 
thicken with five tea-spoonfuls of flour, lumps rubbed out. Six toma- 
toes, or some tomato catsup, improves this. 

A Beef Stew, with Vegetable Flavors. — Cut up four pounds of beef 
into two-inch squares, and add two quarts of water. Let it stew one hour. 
Then add one sliced onion, two sliced turnips, two sliced carrots, four 
sliced tomatoes, four heaping tea-spoonfuls of salt, one small tea-spoonful 
of pepper, four tea-spoonfuls of sugar, and five cloves. Let it stew till 
there is only about a tea-cupful of gravy, and thicken this with a little 
flour. 

The above may be cooked without cutting up the meat, and it is good 
eaten cold. Pressing it under a weight improves it, and so does putting 
it an oven for half an hour. 

A Stew of Chicken, Duck, or Turkey, with Celery or Tomatoes.— 

Take a quart of lukewarm water, and add two heaping tea-spoonfuls of 
Bait, two of sugar, and a salt-spoonful of pepper. Cut up a large head of 
celery, or four large tomatoes. Cut the fowl into eight or more pieces, 
and let all simmer together two hours, or till the meat is very tender. 
Then add two table-spoonfuls of butter, worked into as much flour, and 
let it simmer fifteen minutes. 



STMWS AND SOUFS. 449 

A FaTorite Irish Stew. — Cut two pounds of mutton into pieces two 
inches square ; add a little of the chopped fat, three tea-spoonfuls of salt, 
half a one of black pepper, two of sugar, two sliced onions, and a quart of 
water. Let them simmer half an hour, and then add sis peeled potatoes, 
cat in quarters, that have soaked in cold water an hour. Let the whole 
stew an hour longer, or rather till the meat is very tender. Skim it 
at first and just before taking up. 

Veal Stew. — Put a knuckle of veal into two quarts of boiling water, 
with three tea-spoonfuls of salt and half a tea-spoonful of ground pep- 
per. Then chop fine and tie in a muslin rag one carrot, two small 
onions, a small bunch of summer-savory, and another of parsley ; put 
them in the water, and let them stew three or four hours, till the meat 
is very tender. There should only be about half a pint of gravy at 
the bottom. Pour in hailing water, if needed. Strain the gravy, and 
thicken with four spoonfuls of flour or potato-starch, and let it boil up 
a minute only. This is improved by adding at first half a pound of salt 
pork or ham, cut in strips. When this is done, no salt is to be used, or 
only one tea-spoonful. Tomatoes improve it. 

Another. — Cut four pounds of veal into strips one inch thick and three 
inches long, and peel and soak eight potatoes cut into slices half an inch 
thick. Then put a layer of veal at the bottom, and alternate layers of po- 
tatoes and veal, with a layer of salt pork on the top, Put four tea-spoon- 
fuls of salt, half a one of pepper, four of sugar, and six tea-spoonfuls of 
flour, with lumps rubbed out, into two quarts of water. Pour all upon the 
veal and potatoes, and let them stew till the veal is very tender. Celery 
or tomatoes will improve this. 

A Favorite Turliish Stew, (called Pilaff.)— Take some rich broth, 
seasoned to the taste with pepper, salt, and tomato catsup. Add two tea- 
cups of rice, and let it simmer till the rice absorbs as much as it will take 
up without losing its form — say about fifteen minutes. Cut up a chicken, 
and season it with salt and pepper, and fry it in sweet butter or cream. 
Then put the chicken in the centre of the rice, and cover it entirely with 
rice. Then pour on half a pound of melted butter, and let it stand where 
it is hot, and yet will not fry, for fifteen minutes. To be served hot. 

A Rice or Hominy Stew.— Take four pounds of any kind of fresh meat, 
cut into pieces two inches square, and put in the stew-pan with one pint 
of hominy. Then put into two quarts of warm water five heaping tea^ 
spoonfuls of salt, four of susjar, half a one of pepper, and three of vinegar. 
Let them simmer four or five hours, till the meat is very tender. A tea- 
cup of rice may be used instead of hominy. A little salt pork improves 
this, as well as all other stews. 



450 THE housekeeper's MANUAL. 

A Fayorite Enarlish Beef Stew. — Simmer a sliank or hock of beef, in 
four quarts of water, with four heaping table-spoonfuls of salt, until the 
beef is soft and the water reduced to about two quarts. Then add peeled 
and soaked potatoes cut into thick slices, two tea-spoonfuls of pepper, two 
of sweet marjoram, and two of either thyme or summer savory. Stew 
till the potatoes are soft, add bread-crumbs and more salt if needful. One 
or two onions cut iine, and put in at first, improve it for most persons. 

French Stew, or Pot au Feu. — Put three pounds of fresh meat into 
three quarts of cold water, with two tea-spoonfuls of salt. When it be- 
gins to simmer, add a gill of cold water, and skim thoroughly. Then add 
a quarter of a pound of liver, a medium-sized carrot sliced, two small 
turnips, two middle-sized leeks, half a head of celery, one sprig of pars- 
ley, a bay leaf, one onion with two cloves stuck in it, and two cloves of 
garlic. Simmer five hours.' Strain the broth into a soup-dish, and serve 
the meat and vegetables on a platter. If more water is needed, add 
that which is boiling. 

When the dish is served all together, it is called Pot au Feu, and the 
vessel in which it is cooked has the same name. It is the-common dish 
of the French peasantry. 

The following is the recipe for the favorite Spanish dish. 
A superior housekeeper tried it, and it was so much liked that 
several lof her family were hai-med by eating too much : 

Spanish Olla Podrida. — Fry four ounces of salt pork in the pot, and, 
when partly done, add two pounds of fresh beef and a quarter of a pound 
of ham. Add two tea-spoonfuls of salt in cold water, and only enough 
just to cover the meat. Skim carefully the first half-hour, and then add 
a gill of peas, (if dried, soak them an hour first,) half a head of cabbage, 
one carrot, one turnip, two leeks, three stalks of celery, three stalks of 
parsley, two stalks of thyme, two cloves, two onions sliced, two cloves of 
garlic, ten pepper corns, and a pinch of powdered mace or nutmeg. 
Simmer steadily for five hours. When the water is too low, add that 
which is boiling. Put the meat on a platter, and the vegetables around 
it. Strain the liquor on to toasted bread iu a soup-dish. 

All these articles can be obtained at grocers or markets in our large 
cities, and of course can be procured iu the country. 

French Mutton Stew.— Take a leg of mutton and remove the large 
bone, leaving the bone at the small end as a handle ; cut off also the bone 
below the knuckle, and fix it with skewers. 

Put it in a stew-pan with a phich of allspice,, four onions, two cloves, 
two carrots, each cut in four pieces, a small bunch of parsley, two bay- 
leaves, three sprigs of thyme, and scdt and peeper to the taste. Add two 



STEWS AND SOtrPS. 45] 

ounces of bacon cut in slices, a quarter of a pint of brotli, and cold water 
enough to cover it. After one hour of simmering, add a wine-glass of 
French brandy. 

Let them simmer five hours longer, and then dish it ; strain the sauce 
on it, and serve. 

The American housekeeper by experiments can modify these 
foreign recipes to meet the taste of her family, and will find 
them economical modes of cooking, as well as healthful to most 
persons. 

FRENCH MODES OF COOKING SOTTPS AND STEWS. 

The writer has examined the recipes of Gouffee, the chief 
French cook of the Queen of England, set forth in the expen- 
sive Royal Cook-Book ; also those of Soyer and Professor Blot. 
She and her friends also have tested many of their recipes. 

The following are most of the flavors used hy them in cook- 
ing soups, stews, hashes, etc. Combination of these is recom- 
mended by those authors in these proportions : 

One fourth of an ounce of thyme. 
One fourth of an ounce of bay leaf. 
One eighth of an ounce of marjoram. 
One eighth of an ounce of rosemary. 

Dry the above when fresh, mix in a mortar, and keep them corked 
tight in a glass bottle. 

Also the following in these proportions : 

Half an ounce of nutmeg. 

Half an ounce of cloves. 

One fourth of an ounce of black pepper. 

One eighth of an ounce of Cayenne pepper. 

Pound, mix, and keep corked tight in glass. In using these with salt, 
put one ounce of the last recipe to four ounces of salt. In making force- 
meat and hashes, use at the rate of one ounce of this spiced salt to three 
pounds of meat. 

Soup Powder. — Two ounces of parsley 
Two ounces of winter savory. 
Two ounces of sweet marjoram. 
Two ounces of lemon-thyme. 
One ounce of lemon-peel. 



452 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

One ounce of sweet basil. 

Dry, pound, sift, and keep in a tight-corked bottle. 

Let the housekeeper add these flavors so that they will not 
he strong, but quite delicate, and then make aruleforthe cooJc. 

The peculiar excellence of French cooking is the combina- 
tion of flavors, so that no one is predominant, and all are deli- 
cate in force and quantity. 



SOUPS. 

General Directions, 

Most of the preceding stews will serve also fairly as soups, 
by adding more water. Rub salt into meat for soups, but not 
for stews, as the salt extracts the juices; and in stews the meat 
is to be eaten, while in soups piioperly so called it is only the 
liquor that is served. Put meat into cold water for soups, as 
slowly heating also extracts the juices. For this same reason, 
meat that is boiled for eating should be put into boiling water 
to keep the juices in it. 

Always skim often, as soon as the water begins to simmer ; 
and do not add the salt and other seasoning till the scum ceases 
to rise. 

Do not boil after the juices are extracted, as too much boil- 
ing injures the flavor. 

Never cool soup in metal, as there may be poison in the 
soldering or other parts. 

If you flavor soup by vegetables, do not boil them in the 
soup, but in very little water, which is to be added to the soup 
with them, as it contains much of their flavor. 

When onion is used for flavor, slice and fry it, and dredge 
on a little flour ; add the water in which the vegetables for 
soup were boiled, or some meat broth, and then pour it into 
the soup. If you flavor with wine, soy, or catsup, put them 
into the tureen, and pour the soup upon them, as the flavor is 
lessened by putting them into the soup-kettle. Bread-crumbs, 
toast, or crackers also must be put in the tureen. Keep soup 
covered tight while boiling, to keep in flavors. If water is 
added, it must be boiling. The rule to guide in using salt and 
pepper is a heaping tea-spoonful of salt to a quart of water, 



454 TSE HOUSEKEBPES^ 8 MANUAL. 

and one sixth as much pepper. But as tastes are different, 
and the salt and pepper vary in strength, the housekeeper 
can, on trial, change the recipe with a pencil. 

Soup stock is broth of any kind of meat prepared in large 
quantity, to keep on hand for gravies and soups. Beef 
and veal make the best stock. One hind shin of befef makes 
five quarts of stock, and one Uind shin of veal makes three 
quarts. Wash and put into twice as much water as you wish 
to, to have soup, and simmer five or six hours. 

All kinds of bones should be mashed and boiled five or six 
hours, to take out all the nutriment, the liquor then strained, 
and kept in earthenware or stone, not in tin. Take off the fat 
when cool. 

Cool broth quickly, and it keeps longer. 

Use a flat-bottom kettle, as less likely to scorch. 

Soft water is best for soups ; a little soda improves hard 
water. 

Stock will keep three or four days in cool weather ; not so 
long in warm. Keep it in a cool place. When used, heat to 
boiling point, and then take up and flavor. 

Put in the salt and pepper when the meat is thoroughly done. 

Meat soups are best the second day, if warmed slowly and 
taken up as soon as heated. If heated-too long, they become 
insipid. 

Thin soups must be strained. If to be made very clear, stir 
in one or two well-beaten eggs, with the shells, and let it boU 
half an hour. 

Use the meat of the soup for a hash, warmed together with 
a little fat, and well seasoned. 

Be very careful, in using bones and cold meats for soups 
that none is tainted, for the soup may be ruined by a sin- 
gle bit of tainted meat or bone. 

Potato Sonp. — Take six large mealy potatoes, sliced and soaked an 
hour. Add one onion, sliced and tied in a rag, a quart of milk, and a, 
quarter of a pound of salt pork cut in slices. Boil three quarters of an 
hour, and then add a table-spoonful of melted butter and a well-beaten 
egg, mixed in a cup of milk. This is a favorite soup with many, and 
easily made. Some omit the pork, and use salt and pepper to flavor it, 
and add one well-beaten egg. 



SOUPS. 455 

Green Corn Sonp. — This is very nice made witli sweet corn put into 
seasoned soup stock. 

Plain Beef Sonp. — Put three pounds of beef and one chopped onion, ' 
tied in a rag, to three quarts of cold water. Simmer till the meat is very 
soft — say four hours ; then add three teai-spoonfuls of salt, as much sugar, 
and half a tea-spoonful of pepper. Any other flavors may be added to suit 
the taste. Strain the soup, and save the meat for mince-meat or hash. 
Half a dozen sliced tomatoes will much improve this. Some would 
thicken with three or four tea-spoonfuls of potato-starch or flour. 

Bicll Beef Sonp. — The following is a specimen of soups that are most 
stylish, rich, and demand most care in preparation : 

Simmer six pounds of beef for six hours in six quarts of water, using 
the bones, broken in small pieces. Cool it, and take off the fat. Next 
day, an hour before dinner, take out the meat to use for l»ash or mince- 
meat, heat the liquor, throw in some salt to raise the scum, and skim it 
well. Then slice small, and boil in very little water, these vegetables : 
two turnips, two carrots, one head of celery, one quart of tomatoes, half 
a head of small white cabbage, one pint of green corn or Shaker corn, 
soaked over night. Cook the cabbage in two waters, throwing away the 
first. Boil the soup' half an hour after these are put in. Season with 
salt, pepper, mace, and wine to suit the taste. 

Green Pea Soup. — Boil the pods an hour in a gallon of water. Strain 
the liquor, and put into it four pounds of beef or mutton, and simmer 
one hour. Then add half the peas contained in half a peck of pods, and 
boil half an hom: ; then thicken with two great spoonfuls of flour, and sea- 
son with salt and pepper. Three tomatoes, sliced, improve this. 

Dried Bean Sonp or Pea Soup.— Soak the beans, if dry, over night, 
and then boil till soft. Then strain them through a colander ; and to 
each quart of liquor add a tea-spoonful of sugar, a tea-spoonful of salt, and 
a salt-spoonful of pepper. Add a beaten egg, a tea-cup of milk, and two 
spoonfuls of butter. A sliced onion improves it for some, and not for 
others ; also, half the juice of a lemon when taken up. Canned sweet- 
corn, or common corn with sugar added, makes good succotash for winter. 

Clam Soup.— Wash and boil the clams till they come out of their shells 
easily ; then choj them, and put them back into the liquor, which should 
first be strained. Add a tea-cup of milk for each quart of soup ; thicken 
with a little flour, into which has been worked as much butter as it will 
hold, and season with salt and pepper to suit the taste. 

A Vegetable and Meat Soup for Sninmer.-Take three quarts of 
stock that is duly seasoned with sugar, salt, and pepper. Add two small 



456 TJIE HOUSBKBEPBR' S MANUAL. 

onions, chopped fine, three small carrots, three small turnips, one stalk of 
celery, and a pint of green peas — all chopped fine. Let it simmer two 
hours, and then serve it. 

Dried Pea Soup, with Salt Pork. — Soak a quart of split peas over 
night in soft water. Next morning wash them and put them in four quarts 
of water, with a tea-spoonful of sugar, two carrots, two small onions, and 
one stalk of celery — all cut in small pieces. Let them boil three hours. 
Boil a pound of salt pork in another pot for one hour ; take off the skin, 
and put the pork in the soup, and then boil one hour longer. 

Dried Bean or Pea Soup, with Meat Stock. — Soak a pint of beans 
or split peas over night in soft water. Then boil them in three quarts of 
Boup-stock, duly seasoned with salt and pepper, with one small onion, one 
turnip, one stalk of celery, and six cloves — all cut in small pieces. Let it 
boil four or five hours. Strain through a colander. 

Mutton Soup. — Boil four pounds of mutton in four quarts of water, 
with four heaping tea^spoonfuls of salt, one even tea-spoonful of pepper, 
two tea-spoonfuls of sugar, one small onion, two carrots, and two turnips 
— all cut fine — and one tea-cup of rice or broken macaroni. Boil the meat 
alone two hours ; then add the rest, and boil one hour and a half longer. 

French Vegetable Soup. — Take a leg of lamb, of moderate size, and 

four quarts of water. Of potatoes, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, and turnips 

, take a tea-cupful of each, chopped fine. Salt and black pepper at the 

rate of one heaping tea-spoonful of salt to each quart of water, and one 

sixth as much black pepper. 

Wash the lamb, and put it into the four quarts of cold water. When 
the scum rises, take it off carefully with a skimmer. After having pared 
and chopped the vegetables, put them into the soup. Carrots require the 
most boiling, and should be put in first. This soup requires about three 
hours to boil. 

Plain CalPs Head Soup. — Boil the head and feet in just water enough 
to cover them ; when tender, take out the bones, cut in small pieces, and 
season with marjoram, thyme, cloves, salt, and pepper. 

Put all into a pot, with the liquor, and four spoonfuls of butter ; stew 
gently an hour ; then, just as you take it up, add two or three glasses of 
port wine, and the yelks of three eggs boiled hard. 

An Excellent Simple Mutton Soup. — Put a piece of the fore-quarter 
of mutton into salted water, enough to more than cover it, and simmer it 
slowly two hours. Then peel a dozen turnips, and six tomatoes, and 
quarter tliem, and boil them with the mutton till just tender enough to 
eat. Thicken the soup with pearl barley. Some use, instead of tomatoes, 
tlie juice and rind of a lemon. Use half a tea-cup of rice, if you have no 
pearl barley. 



V. 

HASHES. 

These are the common ways of spoiling hashes : 1. By fry- 
ing, instead of merely heating them. Melted butter and oils 
are good and healthful when only heated, but are unhealthful 
when fried. 2. Dredging in flour, which, not being well 
cooked, imparts a raw taste of dough. 3. Using too much 
water, making them vapid ; or too much fat or gravy, making 
them gross. 4. Using too much or too little salt and other 
seasoning. The following recipes will save from these mis- 
takes, if exactly followed. When water is recommended in 
these recipes, cold gravy will be better, in which case, the but- 
ter may be omitted : 

A Seasoned Hash of any Fresh Meats. — Chop, but not very fine, any 
kinds bf fresli meat, but be sure not to put in any that is tainted. To a 
common tumblerful of chopped meat put three table-spoonfuls of water, 
a tea-spoonful of sugar, a heaping tea-spoonful of salt, a salt-spoonful of 
pepper, and butter the size of half an egg. Warm, but do not fry : and 
when hot, break in three eggs, and stir till they are hardened a little ; 
then serve. Bread-crumbs may be added. This may be put on buttered 
toast or served alone. This and all the following hashes may be varied 
in flavor, by adding, in delicate proportions, the mixed flavors on another 
page. 

A Hash of Cold Fresh Meats and Potatoes. — Take two tumblerfuls 
of meat of any kind, chopped. Add as much cold potatoes, also chopped, 
two table-spoonfuls of sweet butter in six table-spoonfuls of hot water, 
and two tea-spoonfuls of salt. Sprinkle half a tea spoonful of pepper over 
the meat, and also a spoonful of sugar ; mix all, and warm about twenty 
minutes, but not so as to boil or fry. Tomatoes improve this. 

Meat Hash with Egg's, (very nice.)— To a tumblerful of fresh cold 
meat cut in pieces about the size of peas, put three table-spoonfuls of hot 
water, two spoonfuls of butter, a tea-spoonful of sugar, two tea-spoonfuls 
of salt, and a salt-spoonful of pepper. Mix all, warm but not fry • and

when hot, break in four eggs, and stir till they are hardened. Spread on 
buttered toast or serve alone. When eggs are used, the Ineat should not 
be chopped fine. 

A Meat Hash Tvith Tomatoes. — Cut up a pint of tomatoes into a sauce- 
pan, and when boiling hot, add the cold meat in thin slices, with a table- 
spoonful of sugar, and salt and pepper, at the rate of a tea-spoonful of salt 
and half a tea-spoonful of pepper to each tumblerful of meat. 

A Nice Beef Hash. — Make a gravy of melted butter, or take cold 
gravy ; season with salt, pepper, and currant jelly or vinegar. Cut cold 
roast beef or the remnants of cold stake into mouthfuls, and put into 
the gravy till heated, but not to fry. 

Or, season this gravy with the crushed juice of fresh tomatoes or toma- 
to catsup. 

A Simple and Excellent Veal Hash. — Chop cold veal very fine ; but- 
ter a pudding-dish, and make alternate layers of veal and powdered 
crackers till the dish is full, the first layer of meat being at the bottom. 
Then beat up two eggs, and add a pint or less of milk, seasoned well with 
salt and pepper, and two or three spoonfuls of melted butter. Pour this 
over the meat and crackers ; cover with a plate, and bake about half an 
hour. Remove the plate awhile, and let the top brown a little. This is 
the best way to cook veal, and children are very fond of it. 

Rice and Cold Meats. — Chop remnants of fresh meats with salt pork 
or cold ham. Season with salt and pepper and a little sugar ; add two 
eggs and a little butter. Then make alternate layers with this and slices 
of cold boiled rice, and bake it half an hour. 

Uread-Crambs and Cold Meats.— Take any remnants of cooked fresh 
meats, and chop them fine with bits of ham or salt pork. Season with 
salt and pepper ; add three eggs and a little milk, and then thicken with ^ 
pounded bread-crumbs. Bake it as a pudding, or warm it for a hash, or 
cook it in flat cakes on a griddle. 

A Meat Hash with Bread-Crnmbs.— One tea-spoonful of flour, (or po- 
tato or corn-starch,) wet in four tea-spoonfuls of cold water. Stir it into 
a tea-cupful of boiling water, and put in a salt-spoonful of pepper, two 
tearspoonfuls of salt, a tea-spoonful of sugar, and two table-spoonfuls of 
sweet butter. Use cold gravy instead of butter, if you have it. Set this 
in a stew-pan where it will be kept hot, but not fry. Chop the meat very 
fine, and mix with it while chopping half as much dried bread-crumbs. 
Put this into the gravy, and let it heat only ten minutes, and then serve 
it on buttered toast. Tomatoes, ^e or two, improve this. 

A Hash of Cold Beefsteak alone or with Potatoes and Turnips.— 

Make a paste with a heaping tea-spoonful of flour in two tea-spoonfuls of 



BASHES. 459 

water. Stir it into a tea-cup and a lialf of boiling water, witli a salt- 
spoonful of black pepper, a half tea-spoonful of sugar,, and two tea-spoon- 
fuls of salt. Let it stand where it will be hot but not boil. Cut the beef 
Into mouthfuls, and also as much cold boiled potatoes and half as much 
boiled turnips. Mix all, and then add two table-spoonfuls of butter, (or 
some cold gravy,) and a table-spoonful of tomato catsup, or two sliced 
tomatoes. Warm, but do not fry, for ten minutes. 
• When beef gravy is used, take less salt and pepper. 
This is a good recipe for cold beef without vegetables. 

A Hash of Cold Mutton (or Venison) and Vegetables,— Prepare as in 
the preceding recipe, but add one onion sliced fine, to hide the strong 
mutton taste. If onion is left out, put in a wine-glass of grape or currant 
jelly. If the vegetables ara left out, put in a little less pepper and salt. 

A Hash of Coi'ned Beef. — Chop the meat very fine, fat and lean toge- 
ther; add twice as muclicold potatoes chopped fine. For each tumblei^ 
ful of this add butter half the size of a hen's egg melted in half a tea-cup 
of hot water, at salt-spoonful of pepper and another of salt. Heat very hot, 
but do not let it fry. Some would add parsley or other sweet herb. 

A Hash of Cold Ham. — Cliop, not vei'y fine, fat and lean together. 
Add twice the quantity of bread-crumbs chopped but not fine. Heat it 
hot, then break in two eggs for every tumblerful of the hash. A tea- 
spoonful of sugar improves it, and a salt-spoonful of pepper. 

Meats warmed over. — Veal is best made into hashes. If it is liked 
more simply cooked, chop it fine, put in water just enough to moisten it, 
butter, salt, pepper, and a little juice of a lemon. Some like a little 
lemon-rind grated in. Heat it through, but do not let it fry. Put it on 
buttered toa'st, and garnish it with slices of lemon. 

Cold salted or freah beef is good chopped fine with pepper, salt, and 
catsup, and water enough to moisten a little. Add some butter just be- 
fore taking it up, and do not let it fry, only heat it hot. It inj ures cooked 
meat to cook it again. Cold fowls make a nice dish to have them cut up 
in mouthfuls ; add some of the gravy and giblet sauce, a little butter and 
pepper, and then heat them through. 

A nice Way of Cooking Cold Meats.— Chop the meat fine, add salt, 
pepper, a little onion, or else tomato catsup ; fill a tin bread-pan one third 
full, cover it over with boiled potatoes salted and mashed with cream or 
milk, lay bits of butter on the top and set it into a Dutch or stove oven 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

A Hash of Cold Meat for Dinner, (very good.)-Peel six large toma- 
toes and one onion, and slice them. Add a spoonful of sugar, salt and 
pepper, and a bit of butter the size of a hen's egg, and half a pint of cold 



460 THE HOUSEKEEPBB-'S MANUAL. 

water. Shave up tlie meat into small bits, as tliin as thick pasteboard. 
Dredge flour over it, say two tea-spoonfuls, or a little less. Simmer the 
meat with all the rest for half an hour, and then serve it, and it is very 
fine. 

Dried tomatoes can be used. When you have no tomatoes, make a 
gravy with water, pepper, salt, and butter, or cold gravy ; slice an onion 
in it, add tomato catsup, (two or three spoonfuls,) and then prepare the 
meat as above, and simmer it in this gravy haif an hour. ' 

Souse. — Cleanse pigs' ears and feet and soak them a week in salt and 
water, changing the water every other day. Boil eight or ten hours till 
tender. When cold, put on salt, and pour on hot spiced vinegar. Warm 
them in lard or butter. 

Tripe. — Scrape and scour it thoroughly, soak it in salt and water a 
week, changing it every other day. Boil it eight or ten hours, till ten- 
der ; then pour on spiced hot vinegar and broil it.

BOILED MHATS. 

An Excellent Way to cook Tougli Beef. — To eight pounds of beef 
put four quarts of water, two table-spoonfuls of salt, half a tea-spoonful of 
pepper, three tea-spoonfuls of vinegar, and four tea-spoonfuls of sugar. 
Put it on at eight in the morning, and let it simmer slowly till the water is 
more than half gone ; then skim off the grease, and set it in the stove- 
oven till the water is all gone but about a tea-oupful, which is for gravy, 
and may be thickened a little. Add boiling water, if it goes too fast, (for 
in some kinds of weather it will evaporate much faster than in other 
days.) This dish should be very tender, and is excellent cold, especially 
if it is pressed under a heavy weight. This was a favorite soldier's dish ; 
and tough meat is as good as it is tender, when thus cooked. 

Boiled Ham. — The best way to cook a ham is iirst to wash it ; then 
take off the skin and bake it in a pan, with a little water in it, in a stove or 
brick oven, till tender, which is found by a fork piercing easily. Allow 
twenty minutes for each pound. 

To boil a ham, soak it over night ; then wash in two waters, using a 
brush. Boil slowly, and allow fifteen minutes for each pound. When 
cold, take off the skin, and ornament with dots of pepper and fringed 
paper tied around the shank. 

A nice way to treat a cold boiled ham is, after removing the skin, to 
rub it over with beaten egg, and then spread over powdered cracker, wet 
with milk, and let it brown in the oven. Boiled ham is much improved 
by setting it in the oven half an hour, making it sweeter, while the fat 
that tries out is useful for cooking. 

Boiled Beef. — Put it in salted water, (a tea-spoonful for each quart ;) 
have enough to cover it. Skim well just before it begins to boil, and as 
long as the scum rises. Allow about fifteen minutes to each pound, or 
more for beef. Drain well, and serve with vegetables boiled separately. 

Boiled Fowls. — Wash the inside carefully with soda water, to remove 
any taint. Stuff with seasoned bread-crumbs, or cracker, wet up with 
eggs, and sew up the openings. Put them in hoiUng water, enough to 
cover, and let them simmer gently till tender. It is a good plan to wrap 
in a cloth dredged with flour. 



•;o2 TSE housekeeper's manual. 

Fricasseed Fowls. — Cut them up, and put in a, pot, with cold water 
enough to cover. Put some salt pork over, and let them simmer slowly 
till very tender and the water mostly gone. When done, stir in a cup of 
milk, mixed with two well-beaten eggs, first mixing slowly some of the 
hot liquor with the milk and eggs. 

Some fry the pork first, thus increasing the flavor, and others leave it 
out. 

To Boil a Leg or Shoulder of Veal, or Mntton, or Lamb. — Mutton 
should be cooked more rare than any other meat. Make a stuffing of 
chopped bread, seasoned with pepper and salt, and mixed with one or two 
eggs. Make deep gashes in the meat, (or, better, take out the bone ;) fill 
the openings with stuffing, and sew them up. Wrap it tight in a cloth, 
and put it so as to be covered with water, salted at the rate of a tearspoon- 
ful to each quart. Let it simmer slowly about two or three hours. Skim 
thoroughly just before it comes to boiling heat. If needful, add boiling 
water. Save the water for broth for next day. If you pour cold water 
on the cloth before removing it, and let it stand two minutes, it improves 
the looks. 

CalPs Feet. — Wash and scrape till very clean. Boil three hours in 
four quarts of water salted with four even tea^spoonfuls of salt. Take 
out the bones, and put the rest into a sauce-pan, with three table-spoon- 
fuls of butter, two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, a great- spoonful of sugar, 
and a salt-spoonful of pepper. Add three tea-cups of the liquor in 
which the feet were boiled ; dredge in some flour, and simmer for fifteen 
minutes. Garnish with sliced lemon. (Save the liquor to make calf s foot 
jelly.) 

Calf's Liver and Sweetbreads. — These are best split open, boiled, and 
then dtesaed with pepper, salt, and butter. 

To cook Kidneys. — Wash them clean, and split them. Heat them 
half an hour in a sauce-pan, without water. Then wash them again, and 
cover them with a pint of water, having in it a tea-spoonful of salt and a 
salt-spoonful of pepper. Boil one hour, and then take ofi' tlie skin. Cut 
them in mouthfuls ; add two great-spoonfuls of butter, more salt and hot 
water, if needed, and let them simmer fifteen minutes. 

Pillau, a Favorite Dish in the South.— Fricassee a chicken with 
slices of salt pork, or with sweet butter or sweet cream. Put the chicken, 
when cooked, in a bake-dish, and cover it with boiled rice, seasoned with 
salt, pepper, and one dozen allspice. Pile the rice, pour on some melted 
butter, smooth it, and cover with yelk of an egg. Bake half an hour. 

To Boil Smoked Tongues.— Soak in cold water only two hours, as 
long soaking lessens sweetness. Wash them, and boil four or five hours, 



BOILED MEATS. 46a 

according to the size. When ^one, take off the skin and garnish with 
parsley. A table-spoonful of sugar for each tongue, put in the water, im- 
proves them. 

To boil Corned Beef.— Do not soak it, but wash it, and put it in hot 
water, to keep in the juices ; allow a pint for each pound. Skim just be- 
fore it begins to boil. Let it simmer slowly, and allow twenty-five minutes 
for every pound. Keep it covered with water, adding boiling hot water, 
if needed. It is much improved for eating cold by pressing it with a 
board and heavy stone. It is an excellent piece of economy to save the 
water to use for soup. 

Some think it an improvement to put on a little sugar, and pour a little 
vinegar on before boiling. Some like to boil turnips, potatoes, and cab- 
bage with it. In that case, they must be peeled, and the potatoes soaked 
two hours. 

To boil Partridges or Pigeons.— Cleanse and rinse the insides with 
soda-water, and then with pure water. Wrap them in a damp floured 
cloth ; put them into boiling water which is salted at the rate of a heap- 
ing tea-spoonful to a quart ; also, two tea-spoonfuls of sugar and a salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Simmer them twenty minutes to half an hour. 
When done, make a sauce of butter rubbed into flour and half a cup of 
milk ; put the birds into a dish and pour on this sauce. Some would add 
cut parsley, or other flavors. 

To boil Dncks. — Let them lie in hot water two hours. Then wrap in 
a cloth dredged with flour ; put them in cold water, salted at the rate of a 
half a tea-spoonful for each pint. Add a tea-spoonful of sugar for each 
pint. Let them simmer half an hour ; then take them up, and pour over 
them a sauce made of melted butter rubbed into flour, and seasoned with 
lemon-juice, salt, and pepper, and thinned with gravy or hot water. 

Wild ducks must be soaked in salt and water the night previous, to re- 
move the fishy taste, and then in the morning put in fresh water, which 
should be changed once or twice. 

To bofl a Turkey. — Make a stuflBng for the craw of chopped bread 
and butter, cream, oysters, and the yelks of eggs. Sew it in, and dredge 
flour over the turkey, and put it in hot water to boil, with a spoonful of 
salt in it, and enough water to cover it well. Let it simmer for two hours 
and a half, or, if small, less time. Skim it while boiling. It will look 
nicer if wrapped in a cloth dredged with flour while cooking. 

Serve it with drawn butter, in which are put some oysters.

EOAST AND BAKED MEATS. 

The beef of an ox is best, and the next best is that of a heifer. 
The best pieces for roasting are the second cut of the sh'loin, 
the second cut of the ribs, and the back part of the rump. 

The art of roasting well consists of turning the meat often, 
to prevent burning, and basting often, to make it juicy. 

Never dredge flour into gravies, as it makes lumps. Strain 
all gravies. 

Brown Flour for Meat Gravies. — This ia used to thicken meat gra- 
vies, to give a good color. It is prepared hy putting flour on a tin plate 
in a hot oven, stirring it often until well browned ; it must be kept, cork- 
ed, in a jar, and sliaken occasionally. 

Roast Beef. — A piece of beef weighing ten pounds requires about two 
hours to roast in a tin oven before a fire. Allow ten minutes for each 
pound over or under this weight. Have the spit and oven clean and 
bright. They should have been washed before they grew cold from the 
last roasting. 

Put the meat on the spit so that it will be evenly balanced ; set the 
bony side toward the fire ; let it roast slowly at first, turning it often ; 
and when all sides are partly cooked, move it nearer the fire. If allowed 
ito scorch at first, it will not cook in the middle without burning the out- 
side. 

Baste often with the drippings and with salted water, (about half a 
pint of water with half a tea-spoonful of salt,) which has been put in the 
oven bottom. Just before taking up, dredge on some flour, mixed with 
n little salt ; then baste and set it near the fire, turning iteo as to brown 
it all over alike. Half an hour before it is done, pour off the gravy, sea- 
son it with salt and pepper, and thicken with corn or potato-starch, or 
flour. 

To roast in a Cook Stove. — ^Put the meat in an iron pan, with three 
or four gills of water, and a tea-spoonful of salt. Turn it occasionally, 
that it may cook evenly, and baste often. When done, dredge on some 
salted flour, baste again, and set it back till browned. 



BOAST AND BAKED MEATS. 465 

Roast Pork. — Cover a spare-rib with greased paper, till half done ; 
then dredge with flour, and baste with the gravy. Just before taking it 
up, cover the surface with cracker or bread-crumbs, wet up with pepper, 
salt, and powdered sage ; let it cook ten minutes longer, and then baste 
again. Skim the gravy, thicken it with brown flour, season with a little 
powdered sage and lemon-juiee, or vinegar ; strain it, and pour over the 
meat. Pork must be cooked slowly and very thoroughly, and served 
with apple sauce. Tomato catsup improves the gravy. 

Roost Mutton. — The leg of mutton may be boiled. The shoulder and 
loin should always be roasted. 

Put the meat in the oven or roaster, and then pour boiling hot water 
over it, to keep in the juices. Baste often with salt and water at first and 
then with the gravy. With n, hot fire, allow ten minutes for each 
pound. If there is danger of burning, cover the outside with oiled white 
paper. Skim the gravy ; strain it and thicken with brown flour. Serve 
with acid jelly. Lamb requires less time in roasting ; but mutton should 
be rare. Make a brown gravy, and serve with currant jelly. 

Roast Veal. — Follow the above directions for roasting mutton, except 
to allow more time, as veal should be cooked more than mutton. Allow 
twenty minutes to each pound, and baste often. Too much roasting 
and little basting spoil veal. To be served with apple-sauce. It much 
improves roast veal to cut slits in it, and insert bits of salt pork. 

Roast Poultry. — No fowl should be bought when the entrails are not 
drawn ; and the insides should always be washed with soda-water — a tea- 
spoonful of soda to a pint of water. Rinse out with fair water. Stuff with 
seasoned bread-crumbs, wet up with eggs. Sew and tie the stuffing in 
thoroughly. Allow about ten minutes' cooking for each pound, more or 
less, according to the fire and size of the fowl. 

Put a grate in the bake-pan, with a tea-cup of salted water. Dredge 
the fowl with flour at first, and baste often. Strain the gravy, and add 
the giblets, chopped fine. Many dislike the liver, and so leave it out. 
If fowls are bought with the intestines in, or if they have been kept too 
long, the use of soda-water, and then rinsing with pure water, will 
often prevent the tainted taste ; so it is well to do this, except when it 
is certain that the fowl is just killed. Put a tea-spoonful of soda to a pint 
of water. 

Pot-Pie, of Beef, Veal, or Chicken.— The best way to make the 
crust is as follows : Peel, boil, and mash a dozen potatoes ; add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, two table-spoonfuls of butter, and half a cup of milk, or 
cream. Then stiflFen it with flour, till you can roll it. Be sure to get all 
the lumps out of the potatoes. Some persons leave out the butter. 

Some roll butter into the dough of bread ; others make a raised biscuit. 



466 TBE BOUSEKEEPER'S MANITAL. 

■with but little shortening ; others make a plain soda pie-crust. But none 
are so good and healthful as the potato-crust ; so choose what is best for 
all. 

To prepare the meat, first fry half a dozen slices of salt pork, and then 
cut up the meat and pork, and boil them in just water enough to cover 
them, till the meat is nearly cooked. Then peel a dozen potatoes, and 
slice them thin. Boll the crust half an inch thick, and cut it into oblong 
pieces. Then put alternate layers of crust, potatoes, and meat, till all is 
used. The top and bottom layer must be crust. Divide the pork so as to 
have some in each layer. 

Lastly, pour on the- liquor in which the meat was boiled, until it just 
covers the whole, and let it simmer till the top crust is well cooked — say 
half or three quarters of an hour. Season the liquor with salt, at the rate 
of a tearspoonful for each quart, and one sixth as much pepper. If you 
have occasion to add more liquor, or water, it must be bmling liot, or the 
crust will be spoilt. 

The excellence of this pie depends on having light crust, and therefore 
the meat must first be nearly cooked before putting it in the pie ; andthe 
crust must be in only just long enough to cook, or it will be clammy and 
bard. 

SIntton and Beef-Pie. — Line a dish with a crust made of potatoes, as 
directed in the Chicken Pot-Pie. Broil the meat ten minutes, after pound- 
ing it till the fibres are broken. Cut the meat thin, and put it in layers, 
with thin slices of broiled salt pork ; season with butter, the size of a hen's 
egg, salt, pepper, (and either wine or catsup, if liked ;) put in water till 
it nearly covers the meat, and dredge in considerable flour ; cover it with 
the paste, and bake it an hour and a half, if quite thick. Cold meats 
are good cooked over in this way. Cut a slit in the centre of the cover. 

Chicken-Pie. — Joint and boil two chickens in salted water, just enough 
to cover them, and simmer slowly for half an hour. Line a dish with po- 
tato crust, as directed in the recipe for pot-pie ; then, when cold, put the ' 
chicken in layers, with thin slices of broiled pork, butter, the size of a 
goose egg, cut in small pieces. Put in enough of liquor, in which the 
meat was boiled, to reach the surface ; salt and pepper each layer ; dredge 
in a little flour, and cover all with a. light, thick crust. Ornament the 
top with the crust, and bake about one hour in a hot oven. Make a small 
slit in the centre of the crust. If it begins to scorch, lay a paper over a 
short time. 

Rice Chicken-Pie. — Line a pudding-dish with slices of broiled ham j 
cut up a boiled chicken, and nearly fill the dish, filling in with gravy or 
melted butter ; add minced onions, if you like, or a little curry powder. 

Then pile boiled rice to fill all interstices, and cover the top quite thick. 
Bake it for half or three quarters of an hour. 



BOAST AND BAKED MEATS. 467 

Potato-Pie. — Take mashed potatoes, seasoned with salt, butter, and 
milk, and line a baking-dish. Lay upon it slices of cold meats of any 
kind, with salt, pepper, catsup, and butter or gravy. Put on another 
layer of potatoes, and then another of cold meat, as before. Lastly, on 
the top put a cover of potatoes. 

Bake it till it is thoroughly warmed through, and serve it in the dish 
in which it is baked, setting it in or upon another. 

CalPs Head. — Take out the brains and boil the head, feet, and lights 
in salted water, just enough to cover them, about two hours. When they 
have boiled nearly an hour and a half, tie the brains in a cloth and put 
them in to boil with the rest. They should be skinned, and soaked half 
an hour in cold water. When the two hours have expired, take up the 
whole, mash the brains fine, and season them with bread-crumbs, pep- 
per, salt, and a glass of port or claret, and use them for sauce. Let the 
liquor remain for a soup the next day. It serves more handsomely to re, 
move all the bones. Serve with a gravy of drawn butter.

BROILED AND FRIED MEATS AND RELISHES. 

Broiled Mutton or Lamb Chops.— Cut off and the skinny part, which 
only turns black and can not be eaten. Put a little pepper and salt on 
each one, and broil by a quick fire. Mutton chops should be rare. 

Broiled Beefsteak. — Have the steak cut three quarters of an inch to 
an inch in thickness. The sirloin and porter-house are the best. The 
art of cooking steak will depend on a good fire and turning often after it 
begins to drip. When done, lay it on a hot platter, season with butter, 
pepper, and salt ; cover with another hot platter, and send to the table. 
Use beef-tongs, as pricking lets out the juices. Slow cooking and tomcA 
cooking spoils a sieak. 

Broiled Fresh Pork. — Cut in thin slices, broil quickly and very tho- 
roughly ; then season with salt, pepper, and powdered sage. 

Broiled Ham. — Cut in thin slices, and soak fifteen minutes in hot 
water. Pour off this and soak again as long. Wipe dry and broil over a 
quick fire, and then pepper it. Ham that is already cooked rare is best 
for broiling. 

Broiled Sweetbreads. — The best way to cook sweetbreads is to broil 
them thus : Parboil them, and then put them on a clean gridiron for 
broiling. When delicately browned, take them off and roll in melted 
butter on a plate to prevent their bein^ dry and hard. Some cook them 
on a griddle well buttered, turning frequently; and some put narrow 
strips of fat salt pork on them while cooking. 

Broiled Teal. — Cut it thin, and put thin slices of salt pork on the top 
after it is laid on the gridiron, and broil both together. When turning, 
put the pork again on the top. When the veal is thoroughly cooked, 
brown the pork a little by itself, while the veal stands on a hot dish. 

A good Pork Relish. — Broil thin slices of fresh pork, first pouring on 
boiling water to lessen salt n ess. Cut them in small mouthfuls, and add 
butter, pepper, and salt. 

FRIED MEATS AND RELISHES. 

The most slovenly and unhealthful mode of cooking ia fry- 
ing, as it usually is done. If the fat is very hot, and the 



BROILED AND FRIED MEATS AND RELISHES. 469 

articles are put in and taken out exactly at the right time, it is 
well enough. But fried fat is hard to digest, and most fried 
food is soaked with it, so that only a strong stomach can digest 
it. Almost every thing that is fried might be better cooked 
on a griddle slightly oiled. A griddle should always be oiled 
only just enough to keep from sticking. It is best to fry in 
lard not salted, and this is better than butter. Mutton and 
beef suet are good for frying. When the lard seems hot, try 
it by throwing in a bit of bread. When taking up fried arti- 
cles, drain off the fat on a wire sieve. 

A nice Way of Cookin? Calf's or Pig's Liver. — Cut in slices half an 
inch thick, pour on boiling water, and then pour it ofiF entirely ; then let 
the liver brown in its own juices, turning it till it looks brown on both 
sides. Take it up, and pour into the frying-pan enough cold water to 
make as much gravy as you wish ; then sliver in a mry little onion ; add a 
little salt and nutmeg, and a bit of butter to season it ; let it boil up once, 
then put back the liver for a minute longer. 

Beef Liver. — Cut it in slices half an inch thick, pour boiling water 
on it, broil it with thin slices of pork dipped in flour, cut it in mouth- 
fuls, and heat it with butter, pepper, and salt for three or four minutes. 

Egff Omelet. — Beat the yolks of six eggs, and add a cup of milk, half 
a tea-spoonful of salt, and a pinch of pepper. Pour, into hot fat, and cook 
till just stiffened. Turn it on to a platter brown side uppermost. Some 
add minced cooked ham, or cold meat chopped and salted. Others put in 
chopped cauliflower or asparagus cooked and cold. 

Frizzled Beef. — Sliver smoked beef, pour on boiling water to freshen 
it, then pour off the water, and frizzle the beef in butter. 

Veal Cheese. — Prepare equal quantities of sliced boiled veal and 
boiled smoked tongue, or ham sliced. Pound each separately in a mor- 
tar, moistening with butter as you proceed. Then take a stone jar, or 
tin can, and mix them in it, so that it will, when cut, look mottled and 
variegated. Press it hard, and pour on melted butter. Keep it covered 
in a dry place. To be used at tea in slices. 

A Codfish Eelish. — Take thin slivers of codfish, lay them on hot coals, 
and when done to a yellowish brown, set them on the table. 

Another Way.— Sliver the codfish fine, pour on boiling water, drain it 
off, and add butter and a very little pepper, and heat them three or four 
minutes, but do not let them fry. 

Salt Herrin"'S. — Heat them on a gridiron, remove the skin, and then 
set them on the table.

PICKLES. 



Do not keep pickles in common earthenware, as the glazing 
contains lead, and combines with the vinegar. 

Vinegar for pickling should be sharp, but not the sharpest 
kind, as it injures the pickles. Wine or cider vinegar is relia- 
ble. Much manufactured vinegar is sold that ruins pickles , 
and is unhealthful. If you use copper, bell-metal, or brass ves- 
isels for pickling, never allow the vinegar to cool in them, as it 
then is poisonous. Add a table-spoonful of alum and a tea- 
cup of salt to each three gallons of vinegar, and tie up a bag 
with pepper, ginger-roOt, and spices of all sorts in it, and you 
have vinegar prepared for any kind of common pickling, and 
in many cases all that is needed is to throw the fruit in and 
keep it in till wanted. 

Keep pickles only in wood, or stone-ware. 

Any thing that has held grease wiU spoil pickles. 

Stir pickles occasionally, and if there are soft ones, take 
them out, scald the vinegar, and pour it hot over the pickles. 
Keep enough vinegar to cover them well. If it is weak, take 
fresh vinegar, and pour on hot. Do not boil vinegar or spice 
over five minutes. 

Sweet Pickles, (a great favorite.) — One pound of sugar, one quart of 
vinegar, two pounds of fruit. Boil fifteen minutes, skim well, put in the 
fruit and let it boil till half cooked. For peaches, flavor with cinnamon 
and mace ; for plums and aU. dark fruit, use allspice and cloves. 

To pickle Tomatoes. — As you gather them, leave an inch or more of 
stem ; throw them into cold vinegar. When you have enough, take them 
out, and scald some spices, tied in a bag, in good vinegar ; add a little 
sugar, and pour it hot over them. 

To pickle Peaches. — Take ripe but hard peaches, wipe oflF the down. 



PICKLES. 471 

stick a few cloves into them, and lay tliem in cold spiced vinegar. In 
three mouths, they will be sufficiently pickled, and also retain much of 
their natural flavor. 

To pickle Peppers. — Take green peppers, take the seeds out carefully 
so as not to nuingle them, soak them nine days in salt and water, chang- 
ing it every day, and keep them in a warm place. Stuff them with chop- 
ped cabbage, seasoned with cloves, cinnamon, and mace ; put them in cold 
spiced vinegar. 

To pickle Nastnrtions. — Soak them three days in salt and water as 
you collect them, changing it once in three days ; and When you have 
enough, pour off the brine, and pour on scalding hot vinegar. 

To pickle Onions. — Peel, and boil in milk and water ten minutes, 
drain off the milk and water, and pour scalding spiced vinegar on to 
them. 

To pickle Gherkin<i. — Keep them in strong brine till they are yellow, 
then take them out and turn on hot spiced vinegar, and keep them in it, 
in a warm place, till they turn green. Then turn off the vinegar, and 
add a fresh supply of hot, spiced vinegar. 

To pickle Muslirooms. — Stew them in salted water, just enough to 
keep them from sticking. When tender, pour off the water, and pour on 
hot spiced vinegar. Then cork them tight, if you wish to keep them 
long. Poison ones will turn black if an onion is stewed with them, and 
then all must be thrown away. 

To piclde Cacumbers. — Wash the cucumbers in cold water, being 
careful not to bruise or break them. Make a brine of rock or blown salt 
(rock is the best,) strong enough to bear up an egg or potato, and of 
sufficient quantity to cover the cucumbers. 

Put them into an oaken tub, or stone-ware jar, and pour the brine over 
them. In twenty-four hours, tbey should be stirred up from the bottom 
with the hand. The third day pour off the brme, scald it, and pour it 
over the cucumbers. Let them stand in the brine nine days, scalding 
it every third day, as described above. Then take the cucumbers into a 
tub, rinse them in cold water, and if they are too salt, let them stand in it 
a few hours. Drain them from the water, put them back into the tub or 
jar, which must be washed clean from the brine. Scald vinegar sufficient 
to cover them, and pour it upon them. Cover them tight, and in a week 
they will be ready^for use. If spice is wanted, it may be tied in a linen 
cloth and put into the jar with the pickles, or scalded with the vinegar, 
and the bag thrown into the pickle-jar. If a white scum rises, take it 
off and scald the vinegar, and pour it back. A small lump of alum added 
to the vinegar improves the hardness of the cucumbers. 



472 THE housekeeper's MANUAL. 

Pickled Walnuts. — Take a hundred nuts, an ounce of cloves, an ounce 
of allspice, an ounce of nutmeg, an ounce of whole pepper, an ounce of 
race ginger, an ounce of horse-radish, half pint of mustard-seed, and four 
cloves of garlic, tied in a bag. 

Wipe the nuts, prick with a pin, and put them in a pot, sprinkling the 
(spice as you lay them in ; then add two table-spoonfuls of salt ; boil 
Bufficient vinegar to fill the pot, and pour it over the nuts and spice. 
Cover the jar close, and keep it for a year, when the pickles will be ready 
for use. 

Butternuts may be made in the same manner, if they are taken when 
<rreen, and soft enough to be stuck through with the head of a pin. Put 
tliem for a week or two in weak brine, changing it occasionally. Before 
putting in the brine, rub them about with a broom in brine, to cleanse 
the skins. Then proceed as tor the walnuts. 

The vinegar makes an excellent catsup. 

Mangoes. — Take the latest growth of young muskmelons, cut out a 
small piece from one side and empty them. Scrape the outside smooth, 
and soak them four days in strong salt and water. If you wish to green 
them, put vine leaves over and under, with bits of alum, and steam them 
awhile. Then powder cloves, pepper, and nutmeg in equal portions, and 
sprinkle on the inside, and fill them with strips of horse-radish, small bits 
of calamus, bits of cinnamon and mace, a clove or two, a'very small onion, 
nasturtions, and then American mustard seed to fill the crevices. Put 
back the piece cut out, and sew it on, and then sew the mango in cotton 
cloth. Lay all in a stone jar, the cut side upward. 

Boil sharp vinegar a few minutes with half a tea-cup of salt, and a 
table-spoonful of alum to three gallons of vinegar, and turn it on to the 
melons. Keep dried barberries for garnishes, and when you use them, 
turn a little of the above vinegar of the mangoes heated boiling hot 
on to them, and let them swell a few hours. Sliced and salted cabbage 
with this vinegar poured on hot is very good. 

Fine piclded Cabbage. — Shred red and white cabbage, spread it in 
layers in a stone jar, with salt over each layer. Put two spoonfuls of 
whole blac'k pepper, and the same quantity of allspice, cloves, and cinna- 
mon, in a bag, and scald them in two quarts of vinegar, and pour the 
vinegar over the cabbage, and cover it tight. Use it in two days after. 

An excellent Way of preparing Tomatoes to eat with Meat. — Peel 
and slice ripe tomatoes, sprinkling on » little salt as you proceed. 
Drain off the j nice, and pour on hot spiced vinegar. 

To pickle Martinoes. — Gather them when you can run a pin-head into 
them, and after wiping them, keep them ten days in weak brine, chang- 
ing it every other day. Then wipe them, and pour over boiling spiced 
vinegar. In four weeks, they will be ready for use. It is a fine pickle. 



PICKLES. 473 

A convenient Way to pickle Cucumbers. — Put some spiced vinegar 
in a jar, witli a little salt in it. Every time you gather a mess, pour 
boiling vinegar on tliem, with a little alum in it. Then put them iu the 
spiced vinegar. Keep the same vinegar for scalding all. When you have 
enough, take all from the spiced vinegar, and scald in the alum vinegar 
two or three minutes, till green, ar.d then put them back in the spiced 
vinegar. 

Indiana Pickles. — Take_green tomatoes, and slice them. Put them iu 
a basket to drain in layers, with salt scattered over them, say a tea-cup- 
ful to each gallon. Next day, slice one quarter the quantity of onions, 
and lay the onions and tomatoes in alternate layers in a jar, with spice 
intervening. , Then fill the jar with cold vinegar. Tomatoes picked as 
tliey ripen, and just thrown into cold spiced vinegar, are a fine pickle, 
and made with very little trouble. 

To pickle Cauliflower, or Broccoli. — Keep them twenty four hours in 
strong brine, and then take them, out and heat the brine, and pour it on 
scalding hot, and let them stand till next day Drain them, and throw 
them into spiced vinegar. 



SAUCES AND SALADS. 

Success in preparing savory meats and salads depends 
greatly on the different sauces, and these demand extra 
care in preparation and in flavoring. The following is a sauce 
that is a great favorite, and serves for some meats, for fish, 
for macaroni, and for some salads : 

Milk and Egg Sauce, (excellent.) — Take eight table-spoonfuls of 
butter and mix it with a table-spoonful of flour, add a pint of milk and 
lieat it, stirring constantly till it tliickens a little. Then beat the yelk of 
an egg in a table-spoonful of water and mix it well with the sauce, tak- 
ing care that it does not boil, but only be very hot. For fish, add to 
the above a table-spoonful of vinegar or lemon-juice and a little of the 
peel grated. Some add parsley chopped ; and for boiled fowls, add chop- 
ped oysters. Fine bread-crumbs are better than flour for thickening. For 
macaroni, make in the dish alternate layers with that and grated cheese, 
and then pour on this sauce before baking, and it is very fine. Some 
omit the cheese, 

Dra>Tn Butter. — Take six table-spoonfuls of butter, half a tea-spoon- 
ful of salt, two tea-spoonfuls of flour or of fine bread-crumbs worked into 
the butter, and one tea^cup of hot water. Heat very hot, but do not let it 
boil. Two hard-boiled and chopped eggs improve it much. For fish, 
add a table-spoonful of vinegar and chopped capers or green nasturtion 
seeds. 

Mint Sauce for Boast Lamb. — Chop three table-spoonfuls of green 
mint, and add a heaping table-spoonful of sugar and half a coffee-cup of 
vineo'ar. Stir them while heating, and cool before using. 

Cranberry Saure. — Wash well and put a tea-cup of water to every 
quart of cranberries. Let them stew about an hour-and a half, then take 
up and sweeten abundantly. Some strain them through a colander, then 
sweeten largely and then put into moulds. To be eaten with fowls. 

Apple Sauce. — Core and slice the best apples you can get, cook till 
soft, then add sugar and n little butter. Serve it with fresh pork and 
veaL 



GRAVIES, SAUCES, AND SALADS. . 4'75 

TValmit or Butternut Catsup.— Gather the nuts when they can be 
pierced with a pin. Beat them to a soft pulp and let them lie for two 
weeks in quite salt water, say a small handful of salt to every twenty, and 
water enough to cover them. Drain off this liquor, and pour on a pint 
of boiling vinegar and mix with the nuts, and then strain it out. To 
each quart of this liquor put three table-spoonfuls of pepper, one of gin- 
ger, two spoonfuls of powdered cloves, and three spoonfuls of grated nut- 
meg. Boil an hour and bottle when cold. See that the spice is equally 
mixed. Do not use mushroom catsup, as the above is as good and not 
so dangerous. 

Mock Capers. — Dry the green but full-grown nasturtion seeds for a day 
in the sun, then put them in jars and pour on spiced vinegar. These are 
good for fish sauce, in drawn butter. 

Salad Dressing. — Mash fine two boiled potatoes, and add a tea-spoon- 
ful of mustard, two of salt, four of sweet-oil, three of sharp vinegar, and 
the yelks of two well-boiled eggs rubbed fine. Mix first the egg and 
potatoes, add the mustard and salt, and gradually mix in the oil, stirring 
vigorously the while. Stir in the vinegar last. Melted butter may be 
used in place of sweet-oil. The more a salad dressing is stirred, the bet- 
ter it will be. 

Turkey or Chicken Salad, also a lettuce Salad.— Take one quarter 
chopped meat (the white meat of the fowl is the best for this purpose) 
and three quarters chopped celery, well mixed, and pour over it a sauce 
containing the yelka of two hard-boiled eggs chopped, a tea-spoonful of 
salt, half a salt-spoonful of black pepper, half a tea-spoonful of mustard, 
tliree tearspoonfuls of sugar, half a tea-cupful of vinegar, and three tea- 
spoonfuls of sweet-oil or of melted butter. Mix the salt, pepper, sugar, 
and mustard thoroughly, whip a raw egg and add slowly, stir in tlie 
sweet-oil or melted butter, mixing it well and very slowly, and lastly add 
the vinegar. Garnish vrith rings of whites of eggs boiled hard. Chop- 
ped pickles may be added and white cabbage in place of the celery. 

Tomato Catsup. — ^Boil a peck of tomatoes, strain through a colander, 
and then add four great-spoonfuls of salt, one of pounded mace, half a 
table spoonful of black pepper, a table-spoonful of powdered cloves, two 
table-spoonfuls of ground mustard, and a table spoonful of celery seed tied 
in a muslin rag. Mix all and boil five or six hours, stirring frequently 
and constantly the last hoar. Let it cool in a stone jar, take out the 
celery seed, add a pint of vinegar, bottle it and keep it in a dark, cool 
place. 



XL 



FISH. 



Stewed Oysters. — Strain off all the oyster liquor, and then add half as 
much water as you have oysters. Some of the best housekeepers say 
this ia better than using the liquor. Add a salt-spoonful of salt for each 
pint of oysters, and half as much pepper ; and when they begin to simmer, 
add half a small tea-cup of milk for each pint of oysters. When the 
edges begin to " ruffle," add some butter, and do not let them stand, but 
serve immediately. Oysters should not simmer more than five minutes 
in the whole. When cooked too long, they become hard, dark, and taste- 
less. 

Fried Oysters. — Lay them on a cloth to absorb the liquor ; then 
dip first in beaten egg, and afterward in powdered cracker, and fry 
in hot lard or butter to a light brown. If fresh lard is used, put in a 
little salt. Cook quickly in very hot fat, or they will absorb too much 
grease. 

Oyster Fritters. — Drain off the liquor, and to each pint of oysters 
take a pint of milk, a. salt-spoonful of salt, half as much pepper, and 
flour enough for a, thin batter. Chop tlie oysters and stir in, and then 
fry in hot lard, a little salted, or in butter. Drop in one spoonful at a time. 
Some make the batter thicker so as to put in one oyster at a time 
surrounded by the batter. 

Scalloped Oysters. — Make alternate layers of oysters and crushed 
crackers wet with oyster liquor, and milk warmed. Sprinkle each layer 
with salt and pepper, (some add a mry little nutmeg or cloves ;) let thi 
top and bottom layer be crackers. Put bits of butter on the top, pour on 
some milk with a beaten egg in it, and bake half an hour. 

Broiled Oysters. — ^Dip in fine cracker crumbs, broil very qmck, and 
put a small bit of butter on each when ready to serve. 

Oyster Omelet, (very fine.)— Take twelve large oysters chopped fine. 
Mix the beaten yelks of six eggs into a tea-cupful of milk, and add the 
oysters. Then put in a spoonful of melted butter, and lastly add the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Fry this in hot butter or 
salted lard, and do not stir it while cooking. Slip a knife around the 
edges while cooking, that the centre may cook equally, and turn it out 
so that the brown side be uppermost. 



FISB. 477 

Pickled Oysters.— Tate for fifty large oysters half a pint of vinegar, 
six blades of mace, twelve black pepper-corns, and twelve whole cloves. 
Heat the oysters with the liquor, but not to boil ; take out tlie oysters, 
and then put tlie vinegar and spices into the liquor, boil it, and when the 
oysters are nearly cold, pour on the mixture scalding hot. Next day cork 
the oysters tight in glass jars, and keep them in a dark and cool place. 
Vinegar is sometimes made of sulphuric or pyroligneous acid, and this 
destroys the pickles. Use cider or wine vinegar. 

Koast Oysters. — Put oysters in the shell, after washing them, upon 
the coals so that the flat side is uppermost, to save the liquor ; and take 
them up when they begin to gape a little. 

Scallops. — Dip them in beaten egg and cracker'crumbs, and fry or 
stew them like oysters. ^ 

Clams. — Wash them and roast them ; or stew or fry them like oysters ; 
or make omelets or fritters by the recipe for oysters. 

Clam Chowder. — Make alternate layers of crackers wet in milk, and 
clams with their liquor, and thin slices of fried salt pork. Season with 
black pepper and salt. Boil three quarters of an hour. Put this into a 
tureen, having drained off some liquor which is to be thickened with 
flour or pounded crackers, seasoned with catsup and wine, and then 
poured into the tureen. Serve with pickles. 

Boiled Fish. — Wrap in a cloth wet with vinegar, floured inside. Boil 
in cold salted water till the bones will slip out easily ; drain and serve 
with egg sauce, or drawn butter, or a sauce of milk, butter, and egg. 
Try boiling fish with a fork, and if that goes in easily, it probably is done. 

Broiled Fish.— Split so that the backbone is in the middle ; sprinkle 
with salt ; lay the inside down at first till it. begins to brown, then turn 
and broil the other side. Dress with butter, pepper, and salt. It is best 
to take out the backbone. 

Baked Fish. — Wash and wipe, and rub with salt and pepper outside 
and inside. Set it on a grate over a baking-pan, and baste with butter 
and the drippings ; if it browns too fast, cover with white paper. Thicken 
the gravy, and season to the taste, using lemon-juice or tomato catsup: 
Some put in wine. 

Pickle for cold Fish.— To two quarts of vinegar add a pint of the 
liquor in which the fish was boiled, a dozen black pepper-corns, a dozen 
cloves, three sticks of cinnamon, and a tea-spoonful of mustard. Let 
them boil up, and then skim so as not to take out the spice. 

Cut the fish into inch squares, and when the liquor boils, put them into 
it till just heated through. Pack tight in a glass jar, and then pour on 
the pickle ; cook it till air-tight. This will keep a long time. It is a 
great convenience for a supper relish. 



XII. 

VEGETABLES. 

Peesh-gatheeed vegetables are much the best. Soaking in 
cold water improves all. Always boil in salted water, a tea- 
spoonful for each quart of water. Do not let them stop boil- 
ing, or they will thus become watery. 

POTATOES. 

The excellence of potatoes depends greatly on the species, and 
on the age. Much also depends on the cooking, and here there 
are diversities of modes and opinions. Peeling potatoes be- 
fore cooking saves labor at the time of taking up dinner, which 
is a matter of consequence. They shbuld, after peeling, soak 
an hour in cold water ; then boil them in salted water, putting 
them in when the water boils. Have them equal in size, that all 
may be done alike. Try with a fork, and when tender drain off 
the water, sprinkle on a little fine salt, and set them in the oven, 
or keep them hot in the pot till wanted. 

Some boil with skins on ; in this case, pare off a small ring, 
or cut off a little at each end for the water within, to escape, » 
as this makes them more mealy. 

Some make a wire basket and put in the potatoes peeled and 
of equal size ; and when done, take them up and set in the 
oven a short time. This is the surest and easiest method. 

Old potatoes should be boiled in salted water, then mashed 
with salt, pepper, and cream or butter. 

New potatoes boil in salted water, and rub off the tender 
skins with a coarse towel. 

A good Way for old Potatoes. — Peel and soak in cold water half an 
Lour, tlien slice them into salted water tliat is boiling ; when soft, pour 
off the water, add cream, or milk and butter, with salt and pepper, also 
dredge in a very little flour. 



VEGETABLES. 479 

Another way is to chop the cold boiled potatoes, and then mix in milk, 
butter,' salt, and pepper. 

Some cold potatoes are nice cooked on a gridiron. A favorite relish for 
supper is cold potatoes sliced and dressed with a salad dressing of boiled 
eggs, salt, mustard, oil and vinegar. 

Cold Potato Putts. — Take cold mashed or chopped potatoes and stir 
in milk and melted butter. Beat two eggs and mix, and then bake till 
browned. It is very nice, and the children love it as well as their elders. 
This may be baked in patties for a pretty variety. 

To cook Sweet Potatoes. — The best way is to parboil with the skins 
on, and then bake in a stove oven. 

Green Corn. — Husk it ; boil in salted water, and eat from the cob ; or 
cut off the corn and season it with butter or cream and salt and pepper. 
If green corn is to be roasted, open it and take off the silk, and then cook it 
with husks on, buried in hot ashes ; or if before the fire, turn it often. 

Succotash. — Boil white beans by themselves. Cut the corn from the 
cob and let the cobs boil ten minutes, then take them out and put in the 
com. Have only just water enough to cover thecorn when cut. If there 
is more than a tea-cupful when the corn is boiled about half an hour, 
lessen it to that quantity, and add as much milk, and let the boil- 
ing continue till, on trial, the corn is soft, and then stir in a table-spoon- 
ful of flour wet in cold water. Then let it boil three or four minutes, 
take up the corn, and add the beans, with butter, pepper, and salt. Have 
twice as much corn as beans. Some use string-beans cut up. 

If you have boiled corn left on the cob, cut it off for breakfast, and add 
milk and eggs, salt and pepper, and bake it. Some say this is the best 
way of all to cook sweet corn. 

Salsify, or Oyster Plant. — Scrape, cut into inch pieces, and throw into 
cold water awhile; put into salted boiling water, just enough to cover 
them, and when tender turn off the water and add milk, butter, salt, and 
pepper, and thicken with a very little flour ; then serve. Or, mash fine, 
and add a beaten egg and a little flour ; make round, flat cakes, and cook 
on a griddle. 

Egg Plant. — Cut into slices an inch thick and peel. Lay these in 
salted water an hour ; then dip into egg, and rub in bread or cracker- 
crumbs, and cook on a griddle. ^ 

Carrots. Boil in salted water till tender, take off the skin, slice and 

butter them. They are improved by cooking in broth. Some add chop- 
ped onion and parsley. 



480 THE HOUSEKEEPERS MANUAL. 

Beets. — Wash, but do not cut tliem before boiling ; boil till tender, 
take off the skin, slice and season with salt, pepper, vinegar, and melted 
butter. If any are left, slice them into vinegar, for a pickle. 

Parsnips. — Boil in salted water, take off the skins, cut in slices length- 
wise, and season with salt, pepper, and butter. When cold, chop fine, 
add salt, pepper, egg, and flour, make small cakes, and cook on a. 
griddle. 

Pumpkin and Squash. — Cut in slices, boil in salted water till, tender, 
drain, and season with salt, pepper, and butter. Baked pumpkin, cut in 
slices, is very good. 

Celery. — Cut off th oots and green leaves, wash, and keep in cold 
water till wanted. 

Radishes. — Wash, cut off tops, and lay in cold water till wanted. 

Onions. — Many can n6t eat onions without consequent discomfort ; 
though to most others they are a healthful and desirable vegetable. The 
disagreeable effect on the breath, it is said, may be prevented by after- 
ward chewing and swallowing three or four roasted coffee-beans. Those 
who indulge in this vegetable should, as a matter of politeness and bene- 
volence, try this precaution. 

The best way to cook onions is to peel, cut off top and tail, put in cold 
water for awhile, and then into boiling salted water. When nearly done, 
pour off' the water, except a little, then add milk, butter, pepper, and salt. 
When onions are old and strong, boil in two or three waters ;.have each 
time boiling water. 

Tomatoes. — Pour on scalding water, then remove the skins, cut them 
up, and boil about half an hour. Add salt, butter or cream, and sugar. 
Adding green corn cut from the cob is a good variety. Some use pound- 
ed or grated stale bread-crumbs to thicken. Some slice without peeling, 
broil on a gridiron, and then season with pepper, salt, and butter. Some 
peel, slice, and put in layers, with seasoning and bread-crumbs between, 
and bake in an oven. If eaten raw, the skins should be removed by a 
knife, as scalding lessens flavor and crispness. Ice improves them much. 
The acid is so sharp that many are injured by eating too many. 

encumbers. — ^Peel and slice into cold water, and in half an hour drain 
and season with salt, pepper, and vinegar. Some slice them quarter 
of an inch thick into boiling water, enough to cover them, and in fifteen 
minutes drain through a colander, and season with butter, salt, pepper, 
and vineg 

Cabbage and Cauliflower. — Take i the outer leaves and look foi 
any insects to be removed, and let it stand in cold water awhile. 



VEBETABLSa. 481 

Tt should be cut twice transversely through the hardest part, that 
all may cook alike. It is more delicate if boiled awhile in cue -water 
then changed to another boiling hot water, in the same or another 
vessel. If you are cooking corned beef, use for the second water some 
of the meat liquor, and it improves the flavor. Drain it through a 
colander. Some chop the cabbage before serving, and add butter, 
salt, pepper, and vinegar. Others omit the vinegar, and add two beaten 
fggs and a little milk, then bake it like a pudding. This is the favo- 
rite mode in some families. Cauliflower is to be treated like cabbage. 

Asparagus. — The best way to cook it is to cut it into inch pieces, leave 
out the hardest parts, boil in salted water, drain with a colander, and 
add pepper, salt, melted butter or cream, when taken up. Some beat up 
eggs and add to this, stir till hardened a little, and then serve. 

Macaroni. — Break into inch pieces and put into salted boiling water, 
and stew till soft — say twenty minutes. Drain it and put it in layers in 
a pudding-dish, with grated cheese between each layer. Add a little 
salted milk or cream, and bake about half an hour. Many can not eat 
this with cheese. In this case it is better to pour cold soup or gravy upon 
it, and bake without cheese.

FAMILY BKEAD. 

The most important article of food is good family bread, 
and the most healthful kind of bread is that made of coarse 
flour and raised with yeast. All that is written against the 
healthfulness of yeast is owing to sheer ignorance^ as the most 
learned physicians and chemists will affirm. 

Certain recent writers on hygiene are ultra and indiscrimi- 
nating in regard to the use of unbolted flour. The simple facts 
about it are these : Every kernel of wheat contains nutriment 
for different parts of the body, and in about the right propor- 
tions. Thus, the outside part contains that which nourishes 
the bones, teeth, hair, nails, and the muscles. The germ, or 
eye, contains what nourishes the brain and nerves; and the 
central part (of which fine flour is chiefly made) consists of 
that which forms fat, and furnishes fuel to produce animal 
heat, while in gentle combustion it unites with oxygen in the 
capillaries. When first ground, the flour contains all the ingre- 
dients as in the kernel. The first bolting alters the proportions 
but very little, forming what is called middlings. The second 
bolting increases the carbonaceous proportion, making fine 
flour. The third bolting makes the superfine flour, and re- 
moves nearly all, except the carbonaceous portion, which is 
fitted only to form fat and generate animal heat. No animal 
could live on superfine flour alone but for a short time, as has 
been proved by experiments on dogs. 

But meats, vegetables, fruit, eggs, milk, and several other 
articles in family diet contain the same elements as wheat, 
though in difierent proportions ; so that it is only an exclusive 
use of fine flour that is positively dangerous. Still there is no 
doubt that a large portion of young children using white bread 



FAMILY BREAD. 483 

for common food, especially if butter, sugar, and molasses are 
added, have their teeth, bones, and muscles not properly 
nourished. And it is a most unwise, uneconomical, and un- 
healthful practice to use flour deprived of its most important 
elements because it is white and is fashionable. It would be 
much cheaper, as well as more healthful, to use the middlings, 
instead of fine or supei-fine flour. It would be still better to 
use unbolted flour, except where delicate stomachs can not bear 
it, and in thatpase the middlings would serve nearly as well for 
nutrition and give no trouble. 

Some suppose that bread wet with milk is better than if wet 
with water, in the making. Many experienced housekeepers 
say that a little butter or lard in warm water makes bread 
that looks and tastes exactly like that wet with, milk, and 
that it does not spoil so soon. 

Experienced housekeepers say also that bread, if thoroughly 
Jcneaded, may be put in the pans, and then baked as soon as 
light enough, without the second or third kneading, which is 
often practiced. This saves care and trouble, especially in 
training new cooks, who thus have only one chance to make 
mistakes, instead of two or three. 

It is not well to use yeast powders instead of yeast, because 
it is a daily taking of medicinal articles not needed, and often 
injurious. Cream tartar is supertartrate of potash, and soda 
is a supercarbonate of soda. These two, when united in dough, 
form tartrate of potash, tartrate of soda, and carbonate of 
soda ; while some one of the three tends to act chemically and 
injuriously on the digestive fluids. Professor Hosford's method 
is objectionable for the same reason, especially when his medi- 
cal articles are mixed with flour ; for thus poor flour is sold 
more readily than in ordinary cases. These , statements the 
best-informed medical men and chemists will verify. 

Flour loses its sweetness by keeping, and this is the reason 
why sugar is put in the recipes for bread. The best kind of 
flour, when new and fresh ground, has eight per cent of sugar ; 
and when such flour is used, the sugar may be omitted. 

Some people make bread by mixing it so that it can be 
stirred with a spoon. But the nicest kind of bread can be 
made only with a good deal of kneading. 



484 THE housekeeper's MANUAL. 



EBCrPES FOR TEAST AST) BEBAD. 

The best yeast is brewers' or distillery, as this raises bread 
much sooner than home-brewed. The following is the best 
kind of home-made yeast, and will keep good two or three 
weeks : 

Hop and Potato Yeast. — Pare and slice five large potatoes, and toil 
them in one quart of water with a large handful of common hops, (or a 
square inch of pressed hops,) tied in a muslin rag. When soft, take 
out the hops and press the potatoes through a colander, and add a small 
cup of white sugar, a tea-spoonful of ginger, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, and 
two tea-cups of common yeast, or half as much distillery. Add the yeast 
when the rest is only blood-warm. White sugar keeps better than brown, 
and the salt and ginger help to preserve the yeast. 

Do not boil in iron or use an iron spoon, as it colors the yeast. Keep 
yeast in a stone or earthenware jar, with a plate fitting well to the rim. 
This is better than a, jug, as easier to fill and to cleanse. Scald the jar 
before making new yeast. 

The rule for quantity is, one table-spoonful of brewers' or distillery 
yeast to every quart of flour ; or twice as much home-made yeast. 

Potato Teast is made by the above rule, omitting the hops. It can be 
used in large quantities without giving a bitter taste, and so raises bread 
sooner. But it has to be renewed much oftener than hop yeast, and 
the bread loses the flavor of hop yeast. 

Hard Teast is made with home-brewed yeast, (not brewers' or distil- 
lery,) thickened with Indian meal and fine flour in equal parts, and then 
made into cakes an inch thick and three inches by two in size, dried in 
the wind but not in the sun. Keep them tied in a bag in a dry, cool 
place, where they will not freeze. One cake soaked in a pint of warm 
water, (not hot,) is enough for four quarts of flour. It is a good plan to 
work in mashed potatoes into this yeast, and let it rise well before using 
it. This makes the nicest bread. Some housekeepers say pour boiling 
water on one third of the flour, and then mix the rest in immediately, and 
it has the same effect as using potatoes. 

When there is no yeast to start with, it can be made with one jMnt of 
new milk, one tea-spoonful of fine salt, and a table-spoonful of flour. 
When it is worked, use twice as much as common yeast. This is called 
Milk Yeast or Salt Risings, and bread made of it is poor, and soon spoils. 

When yeast ceases to look foamy, and becomes watery, with sediment 
at the bottom, it must be renewed. When good, the , smell is pungent, 
but not sour. If sour, nothing can restore it. 

Thread of Fine Flour.— Take four quarts of sifted flour, one quart of 
lukewarm water, in which are dissolved two tea-spoonfuls of salt, two tea- 



FAMILY BREAD. 485 

spoonfuls of sugar, a table-spoonful of melted butter, and one cup of 
yeast. Mix and knead very tJiorouglily, and have it as soft as can be 
molded, using as little flour as possible. Make it into small loaves, put 
it in buttered pans, prick it witli a fork, and when light enough to crack 
on the top, bake it. Nothing but experience will show when bread is j ust 
at the right point of lightness. 

If bread rises too long, it becomes sour. This is discovered by making 
a sudden opening and applying the nose, and the sourness will be noticed 
as different from the odor of proper lightness. Practice is needed in this. 
If bread is light too soon for the oven, knead it awhile, and set it in a cool 
place. Sour bread can be remedied somewhat by working in soda dis- 
solved in water — about half a tea-spoonful for each quart of flour. Many 
spoil bread by too much flour, others by not kneading enough, and others 
by allowing it to rise too much. 

The goodness of bread depends on the quality of the flour. Some flour 
will not make good bread in any way. New and good flour has a yel- 
lowish tinge, and when pressed in the hand is adhesive. Poor flour is 
dry, and will not retain form when pressed. Poor flour is bad economy; 
for it does not make as nutritious bread as does good flour. 

Bread made with milk sometimes causes indigestion to invalids and to 
children with weak digestion. 

Take loaves out of the pans, and set them sidewise, and not flat, on a 
table. Wrapping in a cloth makes the bread clammy. 

Bread is better in small loaves. Let your pans be of tin, (or better, of 
iron,^ eight inches long, three inches high, three inches wide at the 
bottom, and flaring so as to be four inches wide at the top. This size 
makes more tender crust, and cuts more neatly than larger loaves. 

Oil the pans with a swab and sweet butter or lard. They should be 
well washed and dried, or black and rancid oil will gather. 

All these kinds of bread can be baked in biscuit-form ; and, by adding 
water and eggs, made into griddle-cakes. Bread having potatoes in it 
keeps moist longest, but turns' sour soonest. 

Bread of Middling'S or Unbolted Flour. — Take four quarts of coarse 
flour, one quart of warm water, one cup of yeast, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, 
one spoonful of melted lard or butter, two cups of sugar or molasses, and 
half a tea-spoonful of soda. Mix thoroughly, and bake in pans the same 
as the bread of fine flour. It is better to be kneaded rathef than made 
soft with a spoon. 

Bread raised with Water only.— Many persons like bread made 
either of fine or coarse flour and raised with water only. Success in 
making this kind depends on the proper quantity of water, quick beating, 
the heating of very small pans, and very quick baking. There are cast, 
iron patties made for this p^^pose, and also small, coarse earthen cups. 
The following is the rule, but it must be modified by trying : 



486 THE housekeeper's MANUAL. 

Becipe. — To one quart of unbolted flour put about one quart, or a little 
less, of Jiot water. Beat it very quickly, put it in hot pans, and bake in a 
bot oven. White flour may be used in place of coarse, and the quantity 
ascertained by trial. When right, there is after baking little except a 
crust, which is sweet and crisp. 

Rye and Indian Bread. — The Boston or Eastern Brown Bread is 
made thus : One quart of rye, one quart of corn-meal, one cup of molas- 
ses, half a cup of distillery yeast, or twice as much home-brewed ; one 
tea-spoonful of soda, and one tea-spoonful of salt. Wet with hot water 
till it is stiff as can be stirred with a spoon. This is put in a large brown 
pan and baked four or five hours. It is good toasted, and improved by 
adding boiled squash. 

Third Bread. — This is made with equal parts of rye, corn-meal, and 
unbolted flour. To one quart of warm water add one tea-spoonful of 
salt, half a cup of distillery or twice aa much home-brewed yeast, and half 
a cap of molasses, and thicken with equal parts of these three kinds of 
flour. It is very good for a variety. 

Eye Bread. — Take a quart of warm water, a tea-spoonful of salt, half 
a cup of molasses, and a cup of home brewed yeast, or half as much of 
distillery. Add flour till you can knead it, and do it very thoroughly. 

Oat-Meal Bread. — Oat-meal is sometimes bitter from want of care in 
preparing. When good, it makes excellent and healthfal bread. 

Take one pint of boiling water, one great-spoonful of sweet lard or 
butter, two great-spooufals of sugar ; melt them together, and thicken 
with two thirds oat-meal and one third fine flour. When blood-warm, 
add half a cup of home-brewed yeast and two well-beaten eggs. Mold 
into small cakes, and bake on buttered tins, or make two loaves. 

Fuinpliin Bread and Apple Bread. — These are very good for a 
variety. Stew and strain pumpkins or apples, and then work in either 
corn-meal or unbolted flour, or both. To each quart of the fruit add two 
table-spooufuls of sugar, a pinch of salt, and a cap of home-brewed yeast. 
If the apples are quite sour, add more sugar. Make it as stiff as can be 
stirred with a spoon, and bake in patties or small loaves. Children like it 
for a change. 

Corn-BIeal Bread. — Always scald corn-meal. Melt two table- 
spoonfuls of butter or sweet lard in one quart of hot water ; add a 
tea-spoonful of salt and a tea-cup of sugar. Thicken with corn-meal, 
and one third as much fine flour, or unbolted flour, or middlings. Two 
well-beaten eggs improve it. Makeit as stiff as can be easily stirred with 
a spoon, or, as some would advise, knead it like bread of white flour. 

If raised with yeast, put in a tea-cup of home-brewed yeast, or half aa 



FAMILY BREAD. 487 

much of distillery. If raised with powders, mix two tea-spoonfals of 
cream tartar thorougUy witli the meal, and one tea-spoonful of soda in 
the water. 

Sweet Rolls of Corn-Meal.— Mix half corn-meal and half fine or un- 
bolted flour ; add a little salt, and then wet it up with sweetened water, 
raise it with yeast, and bake in small patties or cups in a very quick oven. 

Soda Biscuit. — In one quart of flour mix very thorouglily two tea- 
spoonfuls of cream tartar, and a tea-spoonful of salt. Dissolve in a pint 
of warm water one tea-spoonful of soda and one table-spoonful of melted 
butter or lard. Mix quickly ; add flour till you can roll, but let it be as 
soft as possible. Bake in a quick oven, and as soon as possible after 
mixing. 

Teast Biscuit. — Take a pint of raised dough of fine flour ; pick it in 
small pieces ; add one well-beaten egg, two great-spoonfuls of butter or 
lard, and two great-spoonfuls ,of sugar. Work thoroughly for ten 
minutes ; add flour to roll, and then cut in round cakes and bake on tins, 
or mold into biscuits. Let them stand till light, and then bake in a 
quick oven. 

If you have no dough raised, make biscuit as you would bread except 
adding more shortening. 

Potato Bisscnit. — Boil and press through a colander twelve mealy po- 
tatoes ; any others are not good. While warji, add one cup of butter, 
one tea-spoonful of salt, four great-spoonfuls of sugar, and half a cup of 
yeast. Mix in white or coarse flour till it can be well kneaded. Mold 
into small cakes ; let them stand till light, and bake in a quick oven. 
These are the best kind, especially if made of coarse flour. 

Buns. — These are best made by the rule for potato biscuit, adding 
twice as much sugar. When done, rub over a mixture of half milk and 
half molasses, and it improves looks and taste.

BREAKFAST AND SITPPEB. 

What shall we have for breakfast to-morrow ? is the con^ 
stant question of trial to a housekeeper, and it is the aim ot 
the present chapter to meet this want by presenting a good 
and successive variety of articles healthful, economical, and 
easily prepared. 

Some of the best housekeepers have taken this method : they 
provide a good supply of the following articles, to be used in 
succession — rice, corn-meal, rye flour, wheat grits, unbolted 
wheat, cracked wheat, pearl wheat, oat grits, oat-meal, and 
hominy, with which they make a new article for every day in 
the week. Some one of these is selected for either a dinner 
vegetable or dessert, or for a dish at tea, and the remainder 
used for the next morning's breakfast. " 

The following will indicate the methods : 

Corn-Meal. — Take four large cups of oorn-meal, and scald It. In oil 
casea, scald corn-meal before using it. Add half a cup of fine flour, three 
talble-spooufuls of sugar or molasses, one tea-spoonful of soda, and one of 
salt. Make a batter, and boil an hour or more, stirring often ; or, better, 
cook in a tin pail set in boiling water. Use it as mush, with butter, 
sugar, and milk for supper. Next morning, thin it with hot water ; add 
two or three eggs, and bake either as muflSus or griddle-cakes. 

Hominy. — Soak and then boil a quart of hominy with two heaping 
tea-spoonfuls of salt. Use it for dinner as a vegetable, or for supper with 
sugar and milk or cream. Next morning use the remainder, soaked in 
water or milk, with two eggs and a salt-spoonful of salt. Bake as muffins 
or griddle-cakes, or cut in slices, dipped in flour and fried. Farina may 
be used in the same way. 

Rice. — Pick over one pint of rice j add two tea-spoonfuls of salt and 
three quarts of boiling water. Then boil fifteen minutes ; then uncover ; 
let it steam fifteen minutes. This to be used for a vegetable at dinner, 
or for a tea-dish, with butterand sugar. At night, soak the remainder in 



BREAKFAST AND SUPPER. 489 

as mucli milk or water, and next morning add as much fine or unbolted 
flour as there was rice, three eggs, a tea-spoonful of salt, and half a tea^ 
spoonful of soda. Thin with water or milk, and bake as muffins or grid- 
dle-cakes. 

The most economical Breakfast Dish, (healthful also.)— Keep a, 
jar for remnants of bread, both coarse and fine, for potatoes, remnants of 
hominy, rice, grits, cracked wheat, oat-meal, and all other articles used 
on table. Add all remnants of milk, whether sour or sweet, and water 
enough to soak all, so as to be soft, but not thin. Wlien enough is col- 
lected, add enough water to make a batter for griddle-cakes, and put in 
enough soda to sweeten it. Add two spoonfuls of sugar, and half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and two eggs for each quart, and you make an excellent 
dish of material, most of it usually wasted. Thicken it a little with fine 
flour, and it makes fine waffles. 

Biscuits of sour Milk and wliite or unbolted Flonr.— One pint 
unbolted flour. 

One spoonful of sugar. 

One tea-spoonful of salt. 

Melt a spoonful of butter in a little of the sour milk ; then mix all, and 
just before setting in the oven, add very quickly and very thoroughly a tea- 
■ spoonful of soda dissolved in half a tea-cup of water. This should be done 
last and quickly, so that the carbonic acid gas produced by the union of 
the soda and the acid of the milk (lactic) may not escape. Use half a tea- 
cup of fine flour when molding into biscuits. 

Pearl Wlieat, or Cracked Wlieat.— Boil one pint in a pail set in 
boiling water till quite soft, but 'BO as not to lose its form. Add a tea- 
■Bpoonful of sugar, and as much salt ; also water, when needed. It mijst 
boil a long time. Eat a part for supper, with sugar and cream, and next 
morning add two eggs, a great-spooAful of sugar, and fine flour enough to 
make it suitable for muffin-rings or drop-cakes. 

Rye and Corn-Meal. — Put into a pint and a half of boiling water one 
tea spoonful of salt, two great-spoonfuls of sugar, two well-beaten eggs, 
three great-spoonfuls of corn-meal or unbolted wheat. Thicken with rye 
flour, and then add two well-beaten eggs. Bake in muffin-rings or as 
dropcakes. 4 

Oat-Meal.— Take one pint of boiling water, and pour it on to one pint 
of oat-meal. Add a great-spoonful of butter, half a tea-spoonful of salt, 
and two greatspoonfuls of sugar. Stir fast and thoroughly ; then add 
two well-beaten eggs, and boil twenty minutes. To be eaten as mush for 
supper ; and next morning thin it, and bake in muffin-rings. 

Several of the above articles are good with only salt and 



490 'J'HE housekeeper's M iNUAL. 

water ; and many persons would like them better with the but- 
ter, sugar, and eggs omitted. 

Wheat Muffins.— One pint of milk, and two eggs. 

One table-spoonful of yeast, and a salt-spoonful of salt. One table- 
spoonful of butter. 

Mix these ingredients with sufficient flour to make a thick batter. 
Let it Tise four or five hours, and bake in muffin-rings. This can be 
made of unbolted flour or grits, adding two great-spoonfuls of molasses, 
and it is very fine. 

Make it so thick that a tablespoon will stand erect in it. 

Sally Llinn improred. — Seven tea-cups of unbolted flour, or flne flour. 

One pint of water. 

Half a cup of melted butter, and half a cup of sugar. 

One pinch of salt. 

Three well-beaten eggs. 

Two table spoonfuls of brewers' yeast, or twice as much of home-brewed. 

Pour into square buttered pans, and let it rise two or three hours with 
brewers' yeast ; with home-brewed, five hours are required. It is still 
better baked in patties. 

Cream Grviddle-Cakes. — One pint of thick cream. 

One tea-spoonful of salt. 

One table-spoonful of sugar. 

Three well-beaten eggs. 

Make a thin batter of unbolted or of flne flour, and bake on a griddle. 

Eoyal Crnmpets. — Three tea-cups of raised dough. 

j^wo table-spoonfuls of melted butter. 

Half a tea-cup of white sugar, mixed with three well-beaten eggs. 

Bake in two buttered pans for half an hour. 

Muffins of flne Flour or unbolted Flour. — One pint of milk or water. 
One pinch of salt. 
Two well-beaten eggs. 
One table-spoonful of yeast. 

Make a thick batter of fine flour or unbolted flour, and let it rise four 
or five hours. Bake in inuffin-rings. 

Unbolted Flour Waffles.— One pint of unbolted flour. 

One pint of sour milk, or buttermilk, or water. 

Half a tea-spoonful of soda, or more if needed, to sweeten the milk. 

Three, well-beaten eggs. 

Two table-spoonfuls of sugar. 

Drop-Cakes of flne Wheat or of Rye.— One pint of milk or water. 
One pinch of salt. 



BREAKFAST AND SVPPBB. 491 

Two table-spoonfuls of sugar. 
Three well-beaten eggs. 

Stir in rye or fine or unbolted flour to a thick batter, and bake in cups 
or patties naif an hour. 

Sachem's Head Corn-Cake.-One quart of sifted corn-meal, scalded. 

One tea-spoonful of salt. 

Three pints of scalded sweet milk or water. 

Half a tea-spoonful of soda in two great-spoonfuls of warm water. 

Half a tea-cup of sugar. 

Eight eggs, the whites beaten separately, and added the last thing 

Ma,k6 the cakes an inch thick in buttered pans before baking, and if 
baked right, they wiU puff up to double the thickness, like sponge-cake 
and are very fine. ' 

Rice Waffles — One pint of milk. Half a t6a^:up of solid boUed rice 
soaked three hours in the milk. ' 

Two cups of wheat flour or rice flour. 
Three well-beaten eggs. Bake in waffle-irons. 
The rice must be salted enough when boiled. 

Another Rice Dish.— One pint of rice, well cleaned. 

Three quarts of cold water. 

Three tea^spoonfuls of salt. 

BoU it twenty minutes ; then pour ofi' the water, add milk or cream, 
and let it boil ten minutes longer, till quite soft. Let it stand till cold,' 
and then cut it in slices and fry it on a griddle. It can also be made into 
griddle-cakes or muffins by the preceding recipe. 

A good and easy Way to use Cold Rice.— Heat a pint of boiled rice 
in milk ; add two well-beaten eggs, a little salt, butter, and sugar ; let it 
boil up once, and then grate on nutmeg. 

BnckTrheat-Cakes. — One quart of buckwheat. 

One tea-spoonful of salt. 

Two table-spoonfuls of distillery yeast, or four of home-brewed. 

Two table-spoonfuls of molasses. 

Wet the flour with warm water, and then add the other articles. Keep 
this warm through the night. If it sours, add half a tea-spoonful of soda 
in warm water. These cakes have a handsomer brown if wet with milk 
or part milk. 

Fine Cottage Cheese. — Let the milk be turned by rennet; or by set- 
ting it in a warm place. It must not be heated, as the oily parts will then 
pass off, and the richness is lost. When fully turned, put in a coarse 
linen bag, and hang it to drain several hours, till all the whey is

out. Then mash it fine, salt it to the taste, and thin it with good 
cream, or add but little cream, and roll it into balls. When thin, it is 
very fine with preserves or sugared fruit. 

It also makes a fine pudding, by thinning it with milk, and adding 
eggs and sugar, and spice to the taste, and baking it. Many persons 
use milk when turned to bonny-clabber for a. dessert, putting on sugar 
and spice. Children are fond of it. 

Various Ways of cookingr Eggs. — Put eggs into boiling water from 
three to five minutes, according to taste. A hard-boiled egg is perfectly 
healthy if well masticated. Another way is to put them in a bowl or an 
egg-boiler, and pour on boiling water for two or three minutes, then 
pour off the water and add boiling water, and in five or six minutes the 
eggs will be cooked enough. 

To make a, plain omelet, beat the yolks of six eggs, add a cup of milk, 
season with salt and pepper, and then stir in the whites cut to a stiff 
froth. Cook in a frying-pan or griddle, with as little butter or fat as pos- 
sible. Let it cook about ten minutes, and then take up with a spad, or 
lay a hot dish over and turn the omelet on to it. This is improved by 
mixing in chopped ham or fowl. Some put sugar in, but it is more apt 
to burn. 

A bread omdet is made as above, with bread-crumbs added, and is very 
good. 

An apple omelet is made as above, with mashed apple-sauce added, and 
this also is very good. Jelly may be used instead of apple.

PUDDINGS AND PIES. 



Where sugar is made by slaves, the little children feed con-* 
stautly on it, and grow fat and healthy. But they are nearly 
naked, live out of doors, exercise constantly, and have nothing 
to do but play. Thus their lungs and skin gain the healthful 
and purifying action of the air and the sun, and the excess of 
carbonaceous food is rendered harmless. But for those whose 
skin never meets the sun, rarely meets the air, and only now and 
then some water, a very different regimen is needful. Sugar, 
molasses, butter, and fats are chiefly carbonaceous, and, there- 
fore, demand a lai-ge supply of oxygen through lungs and 
skin. And yet our custom is to use fine flour, wliich is chiefly 
carbon ; butter and cream, chiefly carbon ; sweet cakes, chiefly 
carbon; sweetmeats and candy, chiefly carbon; and worst of 
all, pie-crusts, chiefly carbon, and the most difficrult of all food 
for digestion. 

But the love for sweet food is common to all, and demands 
gratification. All that is required is moderation and tempe- 
rance. For these reasons, a large supply is here provided of 
cakes and puddings, which are not rich, and yet are as highly 
relished as richer food. As pies are the most unhealthful of 
all food, some instruction and but few recipes are given, lest 
if entirely omitted, the book would not be read so widely, and 
other, more unhealthful ones be used. 

The puddings here oflered afibrd a great variety for desserts, 
are made with far less labor than pies, and are both more eco- 
nomical and more healthful. They also can be made more 
ornamental and attractive in appearance, and equally good to 
the taste. It is hoped, therefore, that the conscientious house- 
keeper will not tempt her family to eat unhealthful food when 
such an abundance is ofieredthat is at once economical of labor, 



494 THE BOUSEKEEPBB'S MANUAL. 

time, expense, and health. The first recipe for pudding can 
be varied in many ways, and has the advantage which hereto- 
fore has recommended pies, namely, that several can be made 
at once, and kept on hand as equally good either cold or 
warmed over. It is also economical and convenient, as not 
requiring eggs or milL 

The Queen of all Puddings. — Soak a tea-cup of tapioca and a tea- 
fpoonful of salt in tlaree tumblerfuls of warm, not hot, water for an hour 
or two, till softened. Take away the skins and cores of apples without 
dividing them, put them in the dish with sugar in the holes, and spice if 
the apples are without flavor ; not otherwise. Add a cup of water, and 
bake till the apples are softened, turning them to prevent drying, and 
then pour over the tapioca, and bake a long time, till all looks a brown- 
ish YELLOW. Eat with a hard sauce. Do not fail to bake a long time. 

This can be extensively varied by mixing chopped apples, or quinces, 
or oranges, or peaches, or any kind of berries with the tapioca ; and then 
sugar must be added according to the acid of the fruit, though some 
would prefer it omitted when the sauce is used. 

The beauty maybe increased by a cover of sugar beaten into the whites 
of eggs, and then turned to a yellow in the oven. Several such puddings 
can be made at once, kept in a cool place, and when wanted warined 
over ; many relish it better when very cold. Sago can be uSed instead 
of tapioca. When no sago or tapioca are at hand, the following recipe 
for flour pudding may be used, baking long time : 

Flour Puddings. — Take four table-spoonfuls of flour, half a tea-spoonful 
of salt, a pint of water or milk, three eggs, and a salt-spoonful of soda. 
Mix and beat very thoroughly, and bake as soon as done, or it will not 
be light. It must bake till the middle is not lower than the rest. Eat 
with liquid sauce. This can be cooked in a covered tin pan set in boiling 
water. This is enough for a family of five. Change the quantity ac- 
cording to the family. 

This may be made richer by a spoonful of butter, more sugar, and 
some flavoring. 

It will be lighter not to beat the eggs separately. If a bag is used to 
boil, rub flour or butter on the inside, to prevent sticking. 

Flour and Fruit Puddings.— Add to the above, chopped apples or any 
kind of berries. Chopped apples and quinces together are fine when 
dried. "When berries are used, a third more flour is needed for those very 
juicy, and less for cherries. Put in fruit the last thing. 

Rusk and Milk. — ^Keep all bits of bread, dry in the oven, and pound 
them, putting half a salt-spoonful of salt to a pint. This eaten with good 



PUDDINGS AND PIES. 495 

milk is -what is especially relished by children, and named' " rusk and 
milk." 

Rusk Puddings. — Mix equal quantities of rusk-crumbs with stewed 
fruit or berries, then add a very sweet custard, made with four or five eggs 
to a quart of milk. Eaten with sweet sauce. This may be made without 
fruit, and is good with sauce. 

Meat and Bnsk Puddings. — Chop any kind of cold meat with salt 
pork or ham, season it well with butter, pepper, and salt, and add two 
or three beaten eggs. Then make alternate layers of wet rusk-crumbs, 
with milk or cold boiled hominy or rice, and bake half or three quarters 
of an hour. Let the upper layer be crumbs, and cover with a plate while 
baking, and, when nearly done, take it off to brown the top. 

A handsome and good Pudding easily Made.— Put a pint of scalded 
milk (water will do as well) to a pint of bread-crumbs, and add the yelks 
of four eggs, well beaten, a tea-cup of sugar, butter the size of an egg, 
and the grated rind of one lemon. Bake and, when cool, cover with 
stewed fruit of any kind. Then beat the whites of the eggs into five 
table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar and the juice of one lemon. Cover the 
pudding with it, and set in the oven till it is a brownish yellow. ■ Pud- 
dings covered with sugar and eggs in this way are called Meringue 
Puddings. * 

Pan Dowdy. — Put apples pared and. sliced into a large pan, and put 
in an abundance of molasses or sugar, and some spice if the apples have 
little flavor ; not otherwise. Cover with bread-dough, rolled thin, or a 
potato pie-crust. Bake a long time, and then break the crust into the 
fruit in small pieces. Children are very fond of this, especially if well 
sweetened and baked a long time. 

Corn-Meal " Pop-orers. — Two tumblers of scalded corn-meal fresh 
'ground, three well-beaten eggs, a cup of milk or water, a tea-spoonful 
of salt, and three of sugar, two spoonfuls of melted butter. Bake in hot 
patties, and eat with sweet sauce. 

Best Apple-Pie.— Take a deep dish, the size of a soup-plate, fill it 
heaping with peeled tart apples, cored and quartered ; pour over it one 
tea^cup of molasses, and three great-spoonfuls of sugar, dredge over this 
a considerable quantity of flour, enough to thicken the syrup a good deal. 
Cover it with a crust made of cream, if you have it ; if not, common dough, 
with butter worked in, or plain pie-crust, lapping the edge over the dish, 
and pinching it down tight, to keep the syrup from running out. Bake 
about an hour and a half. Make several at once, as tUey keep weU. 

Rice Pudding.— One tea^cup of rice. 

One teacup of sugar. 

One half teiwap of butter. 



496 THE housekeeper' S MANUAL. 

One quart of milk. 

Nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to the taste. 

Put the butter in melted, mix all in a pudding-dish, and bake it 
two houis, stirring it frequently, until the rice is swollen. 
This is good made without butter. 

Bread and Fruit Puddingr. — ^Butter a deep dish, and lay in slices of 
bread and butter, wet with milk, and upon these sliced tart apples, 
sweetened and spiced. Then lay on another layer of bread and butter 
and apples, and continue thus till the dish is filled. Let the top layer be 
bread and butter, and dip it in milk, turning the buttered side down. 
Any other kind of fruit will answer as well. Put a plate on the top, and 
bake two hours, then take it off and bake another hour. 

Boiled Fruit Padding. — Take light dough and work in a little butter, 
roll it out into a very thin large layer, not a quarter of an inch thick. 
Cover it thick with berries or stewed fruit, and put on sugar, roll it up 
tight, double it once or twice, and fasten up the ends. Tie it up in a bag, 
giving it room to swell. Eat it with butter, or sauce not very sweet. 

Blackberries, whortleberries, raspberries, apples, and peaches, all make 
excellent puddings in the same way. 

Eng-Iisli Curd Pudding.— One quart of milk. 
A bit of rennet to curdle it. 

Press out the whey, and put into the curds three eggs, a, nutmeg, and 
a table-spoonful of brandy. Bake it like custard. 

Common Apple-Pie. — Pare your apples, and cui them from the core. 
Line your dishes with paste, and put in the apple ; cover and bake until 
the fruit is tender. Then take them from the oven, remove the upper 
crust, and put in sugar and nutmeg, cinnamon or rose-water, to your taste. 
A bit of sweet butter improves them. Also, to put in a little orange-peel , 
before they are baked, makes a pleasant variety. Common apple-pies 
are very good to stew, sweeten, and flavor the apple before they are put 
into the oven. Many prefer the seasoning baked in. All apple-pies are 
miich nicer if the apple is grated and then seasoned. 

Plain Custard. — Boil half a dozen peach-leaves, or the rind of a lemon, 
or a vanilla beau in a quart of milk ; wlieu it is flavored, pour into it a 
paste made by a table-spoonful of rice flour, or common flour, wet up with 
two spoonfl&ls of cold milk and a half tea-spoonful of salt, and stir it till 
it boils again. Then beat up four eggs and put in, and sweeten it to 
your taste, and pour it out for pies or pudding. More eggs make it a rich 
custard. 

Bake as pudding, or boil in a tin pail set in boiling water, stirring 
often, and pour into cups. 



PUDDINGS AND FIES. 497 

Another Custard. — Boil six peach-leaves, or a lemon-peel, in a quart 
of milk, till it is flavored ; cool it, add three spoonfuls of sugar, a 
tea-spoonful of salt, and five eggs beaten to a froth. Put the custard 
into a tin pail, set it in boiling water, and stir it till cooked enough. 
Then turn it into cups ; if preferred, it can be baked. 

Mush, or Hasty Padding.— Wet up the Indian-meal in cold water, till 
there are no lumps, stir it gradually into boiling water which has a 
little sugar and more salt added ; boil till so thick that the stick will 
stand in it. Boil slowly, and so as not to burn, stirring often. Two or 
three hours' boiling is needed. Pour it into a broad, deep dish, let it 
grow cold, cut it into slices half an inch thick, flour them, and fry them 
on a griddle with a little lard, or bake them in a stove oven. 

Stale Bread Pudding, (fine.) — Cut stale bread in thick slices, and 
put it to soak for several hours in cold milk. 

Then cook on a griddle, with some salt, and eat it with sugar, or mo- 
lasses, or a sweet sauce. To make it more delicate, take off the crusts. 
It is still better to soak it in uncooked custard. Baker's bread is best. 

To prepare Rennet "Wine. — Put three inches square of calf s rennet to 
a pint of wine, and set it away for use. Three table-spoonfuls will serve 
to curdle a quart of milk. 

Rennet Custard. — Put three table-spoonfuls of rennet wine to a quart 
of milk, and add four or five great-spoonfuls of white sugar, and a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Flavor it with wine, or lemon, or rose-water. It must 
be eaten in an hour, or it will turn to curds. 

Bird's-Nest Pudding. — Pare tart, well-flavored apples, scoop out the, 
cores without dividing the apple, put tjiem in a deep dish with a small 
bit of mace, and a spoonful of sugar in the opening of each apple. Pour 
in water enough to cook them. When soft, pour over them an unbaked 
custard, so as just to cover them, and bake till the custard is done. 

AMinnte Pudding of Potato Starch— Take four heaped table-spoon- 
fuls of potato flour, three eggs, and a tea-spoonful of salt, and one 
quart of milk. Boil the milk, reserving a little to moisten the flour. Stir 
the flour to a paste, perfectly smooth, with the reserved milk, and put it 
into the boiling milk. Add the eggs well beaten, let it boil till very 
thick, which will be in two or three minutes, then pour into a dish and 
serve with liquid sauce. After the milk boils, the pudding must be stirred 
every moment till done. 

Tapioca Pudding. — Soak eight table-spoonfuls of tapioca in a quart 
of warm milk and tea-spoonful of su9;ar, till soft, then add two table- 
spoonfuls of melted sweet lard or butter, five eggs well beaten, spice. 



498 THE BOUSEKEEPEB' S MANUAL. 

sugar, and wine to your taste. Bake in a buttered disli, without any 
lining. Sago may be used in place of tapioca. 

Cocoa-nut Pudding, (plain.)— Take one quart of milk, five eggs, and 
one cocoa-nut, grated. The eggs and sugar are beaten together, and 
stirred into the milk when hot. Strain the milk and eggs, and add the 
cocoa-nut, with nutmeg to the taste. Bake about twenty minutes like 
paddings. 

New-England Squash or Pumpkin-Pie.— -Take a pumpkin or winter- 
squash, cut in pieces, take off the rind and remove the seeds, and boil 
it until tender, then rub it through a sieve. When cold, add to it milk 
to thin it, and to each quart of milk five well-beaten eggs. Sugar, cin- 
namon, and ginger to your taste. The quantity of milk must depend 
UDon the size and quality of the squash. 

These pies require a moderate heat, andmust be baked until the centre 
is firm. 

Bipe Fruit-Pies— Peach, Cherry, PInm, Currant, and Strawben-y. 

— Line your dish with paste. After picking over and washing the fruit 
carefully, (peaches must be pared, and the rest picked from the stem,) 
place a layer of fruit and a layer of sugar in your dish, until it is well 
filled, then cover it with paste, and trim the edge neatly, and prick 
the cover. Fruit-pies require about an hour to bake in a thoroughly -heated 
oven. 

Mock Cream. — Beat three eggs well, and add three heaping tea-spoon- 
fuls of sifted flour. Stir it into a pint and a half of boiling milk, add a 
salt-spoon of salt, and sugar to your taste. Flavor with rose-water or 
essence of lemon. 

This can be used for cream-cakpB or pastry. 

A Pudding of Fruit and Bread-Crumbs. — Mix a pint of dried and 
pounded bread-crumbs with an equal quantity of any kind of berries, or 
of dried and chopped sour apples. Add three eggs, half a pint of mjlk, 
tliree spoonfuls of fine flour, and half a tea spoonful of salt. Bake on a 
griddle or in an oven in muffin-rings, or, when made thinner, as griddle- 
cakes. If dried fruit is used, more milk is needed than for fresh berries. 

This may also be boiled for a pudding. Flour the pudding-cloth and 
tie tight, as it will not swell in cooking. 

Bread and Apple Dumplings. — Mix half a pint of dried bread-crumbs 
and half a pint of fine flour. Wet it with water and two eggs thick 
enough to roll. Then put it around large apples peeled and cored whole, 
and boil for dumplings in several small floured cloths, or put all into one 
large floured cloth, tied tight, as they will not swell. Try with a fork, 
and when the apples are soft, take up and serve with a sweet sauce. 



PUDDINOS AND PIES. 499 

An excellent Indian Pudding without Eggs.— Take seven heaping 
spoonfuls of scalded Indian meal, half a tea-spoonful of salt, two spoonfuls 
ofbutter or sweet lard, a tea-cup of molasses, and two tea-spoonfuls of gin- 
ger or cinnamon, to the taste. Pour into these » quart of milk while 
boiling hot. Mis well and put in a buttered dish. Just as you set it in 
the oven, stir in a tea-cup of cold water, which will produce the same 
eflEect as eggs. Bake three quarters of an hour in a dish that will not 
spread it out thin. 

Boiled Indian and Suet Puddinj. — Three pints of milk, ten heaping 
table-spoonfuls of sifted Indian meal, a tumblerful of molasses, two eggs. 
Scald the meal with the milk, add the molasses and a tea-spoonful of salt. 
Put in the eggs when it is cool enough not to scald them. Put in a table- 
spoonful of ginger. Tie the bag so that it will be about two thirds full 
of the pudding in order to give room to swell. The longer it is boiled 
the better. Some like a little chopped suet with the above. 

A Dessert of Eice and Fruit. — Pick over and wash the rice, and boil 
it fifteen minutes iu water, with salt at the rate of a heaping tea-spoonful 
to a quart. Rice is much improved by having the salt put in whUe 
cooking. Pour out the water iu fifteen minutes after it begins to boil. 
Then pour in rich milk and boil till of a pudding thickness. Then pour 
it into cups to harden, when it is to be turned out inverted upon a platter 
in small mounds. Make an opening on the top of each and put' in a pile 
of jelly or fruit. Lastly, pour over all a custard made of three eggs, a 
pint of milk, and a tea-spoonful of salt boiled in a tin pail set in boiling 
water. This looks very prettily. Sweet cream with a little salt can be 
used instead of custard. This can be modified by having the whole put 
in a bowl and hardened, and then inverted and several openings made for 
the fruit. 

Another Dessert of Eice and Fruit.— Boil the rice in salted water, 
a tea-spoonful to a quart of water. When cooked to a pudding consisten- 
cy, cool it and then cut it in slices. Then put a thin layer of rice at the 
bottom of a pudding-dish, cover it with a thin layer of jelly or stewed 
fruit half an inch thick. Continue to add alternate layers of rice and 
jelly or fruit, smooth it at top, grate on sugar, and then cut the edges to 
show stripes of fruit and rice. Help it in saucers, and have cream or a 
thin custard to pour on it. Make the custard with two eggs, half a pint 
of milk, and half a tea-spoonful of salt. Boil it in a pail set in boiling 
water. 

Dessert of Cold Eice and Stewed or Grated Apple.— Cut cold 
boiled rice in slices, and then lay in a buttered pudding-dish alternate 
layers of rice and grated or stewed apples. Add sugar and spice to each 
layer of apples. Cover with the rice, smooth with a spoon dipped in cold 



500 THE ffOUSEKEEPEB'S MANUAL. 

water or milk, and bake tliree quarters of an hour if tlie apples are raw. 
To be served with a sweet sauce. 

A rich Flour Pudding.— Six eggs. 

Three spoonfuls of flour. 

One pint of milk. 

A tea-spoonful of salt. 

Beat the yelks well and mix them smoothly with the flour, then add 
the milk. Lastly, whip the whites to a stiff froth ; work them in, and 
bake immediately. 

To be eaten with a liquid sauce. 

Apple-Pie. — Take fair apples ; pare, core, and quarter them. 

Take four table spoonfuls of powdered sugar to a pie. 

Put into a preserving-pan, with the sugar ; water enough to make a 
thin syrup ; throw in a few blades of mace ; boil the apple in the syrup 
until tender, a little at a time, so as not to break the pieces. Take them 
out with care, and lay them in soup-dishes. 

When you have preserved apple enough for your number of pies, add 
to the remainder of the syrup cinnamon and rose-water, or any other 
spice, enough to flavor it well, and divide it among the pies. Make a 
good paste, and line the rim of the dishes, and then cover them, leaving 
the pies without an under crust. Bake them a light brown. 

Spiced Apple Tarts. — Rub stewed or baked apples through a sieve ; 
sweeten them, and add powdered mace and cinnamon enough to flavor 
them. If the apples are not very tart, squeeze in the juice of a lemon. 
Some persons like the peel of the lemon grated into it. Line soup-dishes 
with a light crust, double on the rim, and fill them and bake them until 
the crust is done. Little bars of crust, a quarter of an inch in width, 
crossed on the top of the tart before it is baked, are ornamental. 

Baked Indian Pudding'. — Three pints of milk. 

Ten heaping table-spoonfuls of Indian meal. 

Three gills of molasses. 

A piece of butter, as large as a hen's egg. 

Scald the meal with the milk, and stir in the butter and molasses, and 
bake four or five hours. Some add a little chopped suet in place of the 
butter. This can be boiled. 

Apple Custard. — Take half a dozen very tart apples, and take off the 
skin and cores. Cook them till they begin to be soft, in half a tea-cup 
of water. Then put them in a pudding-dish, and sugar them. Then 
beat six eggs with four spoonfuls of sugar ; mix it with three pints of 
mUk, and two tea-spoonfuls of salt ; pour it over the apples, and bake for 
about half an hour. 



, PUDDINGS AND PIES. 601 

Plain Macaroni or VermicelU Puddings.— Put two ounces of maca. 
roni or vermicelli into a pint of milk, and simmer until tender. Flavor 
it by putting in two or three sticks of cinnamon while boiling, or some 
other spice when done. Then beat up three eggs, mix in an ounce of 
sugar, half a pint of milk, a tea-spoonful of salt, and a glass of wine. Add 
these to the broken macaroni or vermicelli, and bake in a slow oven. 

Green Corn Pudding.— Twelve ears of corn, grated. Sweet-corn is 
best. One pint and a half of milk. Four well-beaten eggs. One tea-cup 
and a half of sugar. 

Mix the above, and bake it three hours in a buttered dish. More sugar 
is needed if common corn is used. 

Bread Pudding for Invalids or Young Children.— Grate half a pound 
of stale bread ; add a pinch of salt, and pour on a pint of hot milk, and 
let it soak half an hour. Add two well-beaten eggs, put it in a covered 
basin just large enough to hold it, tie it in a pudding-cloth, and boil it 
half an hour ; or put it in a buttered pan in an oven, and bake it that 
time. Make a sauce of thin sweet cream, sweetened with sugar, and 
flavored with rose-water or nutmeg. 

A Good Pudding. — Line a buttered dish with slices of wheat bread, 
first dipped in milk. Pill the dish with sliced apple, and add sugar and 
spice. Cover with slices of bread soaked in milk ; cover close with a 
plate, and bake three hours. 

Loaf Padding. — When bread is too stale, put a loaf in a pudding-bag 
and boil it in salted water an hour and a half, and eat it with hard pud- 
ding sauce. 

A Lemon Pudding. — Nine spoonfuls of grated apple, one grated lem- 
on, (peel and pulp,) one spoonful of butter, and three eggs. Mix and 
bake, with or without a crust, about an hour. Cream improves it. 

Green Corn Patties, (like oysters.) — Twelve ears of sweet-corn grated. 
(Yellow com will do, but not so well.) 
One tea-spoonful of salt, and one of pepper. 
One egg beaten into two table-spoonfuls of flour. 
Mix, make into small cakes, and cook on a griddle. 

Cracker Plum Pudding, (excellent,)— Make a very sweet custard, 
and put into it a tea-spoonful of salt. 

Take soda crackers, split them, and butter them very thick. 

Put a layer of raisins on the bottom of a large pudding-dish, and then 
a layer of crackers, and pour on a little of the custard when warm, and 
after soaking a little, put on a thick layer of raisins, pressing them into 
the crackers with a knife. Then put on another layer of crackers, cus- 



502 TBE HOUSEKEEPERS MANUAL. 

tard, and fruit, and proceed thus till you have four layers. Then pour 
over the whole enough custard to rise even with the crackers. It is best 
made over-night, so that the crackers may soak. Bake from an hour 
and a half to two hours. During the first half-hour, pour on, at three 
different times, a little of the custard, thinned with milk, to prevent the 
top from being hard and dry. If it browns fast, cover with paper. 
Bread and butter pudding is made in a similar manner. 

BAUCBB FOR PUDDINaS. 

Liquid Sauce.— Six table-spoonfuls of sugar. Ten table-spoonfuls of 
water. Four table-spoonfuls of butter. Two table-spoonfuls of wine. 
Nutmeg, or lemon, or orange-peel, or rose-water, to flavor. 

Heat the water and sugar very hot. Stir in the butter till it is melted, 
but be careful not to let it boil. Add the wine and nutmeg just before it 
is used. 

Hard Sauce. — Two table-spoonfuls of butter. 
Ten table-spoonfuls of sugar. 

Work this till white, then add wine or grated lemon-peel, and spice to 
your taste. 

Another Hard Sauce. — Mix half as much butter as sugar, and heat 
it fifteen minutes in a bowl set in hot water. Stir till it foams. Flavor 
with wine or grated lemon-peel. 

A Healthful Pudding Sauce. — Boil, in half a pint of water, some 
orange or lemon-peel, or peach-leaves. Take them out and pour in a thin 
paste, made with two spoonfuls of flour, and boil five minutes. Then put 
in a pint of sugar, and let it boil. Then put in two spoonfuls of butter, 
add a glass of wine, and take it up before it boils. 

An excellent Sauce for any kind of Pudding. — Beat the yelks of three 
eggs into sugar enough to make it quite sweet. Add a tea-cup of cream, 
or milk, and a little butter, and the grated peel and juice of two lemons. 
When lemons can not be had, use dried lemon-peel, and a little tartaric 
acid. This is a good sauce for puddings, especially for the starch minute 
pudding. Good cider in place of wine is sometimes used. 

PASTE FOE PUDDINGS AND PIBS. 

This is an article which, if the laws of health were obeyed, 
would be banished from every table ; for it unites the three 
evils — animal fat, cooked animal fat, and heavy bread. No- 
thing in the whole range of cooking is more indigestible than 
rich pie-crust, especially when, as bottom crust, it is made still 
worse by being soaked, or slack-baked. Still, as this work 



PUDDINGS AND PIES. 503 

does not profess to leave out unwholesome dishes, but only to 
set forth an abundance of healthful ones, and the reasons for 
preferring them, the best directions will be given for making 
the best kinds of paste. 

Pie-Crusts without Fats. — Good crusts for ^lain pies are made by wet- 
ting up the crust with rich milk turned sour, and sweetened with salera- 
tus. Still better crusts are made of sour cream, sweetened with saleratus. 

Mealy potatoes boiled in salt water and mixed with the same quantity 
of flour, and wet with sour milk sweetened with saleratus, make a good 
crust. 

Good light bread rolled thin makes a good crust for pan-dowdy, or pan- 
pie, and also for the upper crust of fruit-pies, to be made without bot- 
tom crusts. 

Pie-Crnst made with Butter. — Very plain paste is made by taking 
a, quarter of a pound of butter fcr every pound of flour. Still richer, 
allows three quarters of a pound of butter to a pound of flour. 

Directions for making rich Pie-Crust. — Take a quarter of the but- 
ter to be used, rub it thoroughly into the flour, and wet it with cold 
water to u. stifi' paste. 

Next dredge the board thick with flour, cut up the remainder of the 
butter into thin slices, lay them upon the flour, dredge flour over thick, 
and then roll out the butter into thin sheets, and lay it aside. 

Then roll out the paste thin, cover it with a sheet of this rolled 
butter; dredge on more flour, fold it up and roll it out, and repeat 
the process till all the butter is used up. 

Paste should be made as quick and as cold as possible. Some use 
a marble table in order to keep it cold. Boll from you every time.

CAKE. 



The multiplication of recipes for cakes, pies, puddings, and 
desserts is troublesome and needless, inasmuch as a little gene- 
ralization will reduce, them to a comparatively small compass, 
and yet afford a large variety. 

Cake is of three classes, as raised either by eggs or by 
yeast or by powders ; and different proportions of flour, sugar, 
shortening, and wetting make the variety, as appears in what 
follows. 

GBNBEAL DIRECTIONS. 

Sift flour, roll sugar, sift spices, and prepare fruit before- 
hand. Break eggs that are to be whipped, one at a time, in a 
cup, and let none of the yelk go in. Have them cold, and 
you will get on faster. 

Excepting dough-cake, never use the hand in making cake, 
but a wooden spoon, ^nd in an earthen vessel. 

The goodness of cake depends greatly on baking. If too hot 
at bottom, set- the pan on a brick; if too hot at top, cover jwith 
paper. If top-crust is formed suddenly, it prevents what is 
below from rising properly; and so, when the oven is very hot, 
cover with paper. 

When fruit is used, sprinkle the fruit with a little flour to 
keep it from sinking when baking. Some put fruit in in lay- 
ers, one in the middle and another near the top, as this spreads 
it evenly. Put in the flour just before baking. 

When using whites beaten to a froth separately, put in the 
last thing, so that the bubbles of air which make the lightness 
may be retained more perfectly. Bake as soon as the cake is 
ready. 



CAKE. 505 

Water is as good as milk for most cakes as well as for bread ; 
a mixture of new and stale milk injures the cake. 

Streaks in cake are made either by imperfect mixing, or un- 
equal baking, or by sudden decrease of heat before the cake is 
done. Try when cake is done, by inserting a splinter or straw ; 
if it comes out clean, the cake is done. 

The best way to keep cake is in a tin box or stone jar. 

Do not wrap cake or bread in a cloth. 

In baking, move cake gently if you change its place, or it 
will fall in streaks. Cake is more nicely baked when the pan 
is lined with oiled paper, especially in old pans, which often 
give a bad taste to the bottom and sides of the cake. 

CAKE RAISED WITH POWDERS. 

Although it is unhealthful to use powders in bread for daily 
food, the small quantity used for cake will do no harm. 

The cake most easily made is raised with soda and cream 
tartar or other baking powders, and many varieties can be 
made by the following recipes : 

One, Two, Three> Tour Cake.— Take one cup of butter, (half a cup 
is better,) two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs. Mix but- 
ter, sugar, and yelks. Then add the flour very thoroughly, and lastly the 
whites in a stiff froth. Bake inlmediately, and the cake will be light, 
with nothing added. But it is equally light to omit the eggs and work 
two tea^spoonfuls of cream tartar into the flour, and then mix well first 
the butter and sugar, and then the flour. When ready to bake, mix very 
thoroughly and quickly a tea-spoonful of soda, or a bit of sal volatile dis- 
solved in a cup of warm (not hot) water. This makes two loaves. The 
following are varieties made by this recipe, using raising either with eggs 
or powders : 

Chocolate-Cake. — Bake the above in thin layers, only a little thicker 
than carpeting. When nearly cool, spread ver the cake a paste made of 
equal parts of scraped chocolate and sugar wet with water. Place the 
cake in layers one over another, frost the top, and then cut in oblong 
pieces for the cake-basket. 

Jelly-Cake. — Proceed as above, only using jelly instead of chocolate. 

Orang'e-Cake. — Proceed as for jelly cake, having flavored the cake 
when making with a little grated orange-peel. The oranges must be 
peeled, chopped fine, and sweetened. 



506 , THJS aOUSEKEEPER^S MANUAL. 

Almoudand Cocoa-nut-Cake. — Blancli tliree ounces of almonds, (that 
is, pour on boiling watet and take off the skins.) Chop or pound them 
with an equal quantity of sugar, make a thin paste with water, and use 
this instead of the jelly. Cocoa-nut, chopped fine, can be used instead of 
almonds. Strawier'nes, Peaches, Oranberries, and Quinces, and any other 
fruit, mashed or cooked, can be used in place of the jelly, being first 
sweetened. 

This cake can be made richer by adding spices and fruit before baking. 
Those who have cream can use it in place of butter. Chopped almonds, 
citron, or cocoa-nut may be put in the cake for baking, making still 
another variety. 

CAKE RAISED WITH EGGS. 

Pountl-Cake, (very rich.) — One pound of flour, one pound of sugar, half 
a pound of batter, nine eggs, a glass of brandy, one nutmeg, one tea- 
spoonful of pounded cinnamon. Mix half the flour with the butter, 
brandy, and spice; add the yelks of eggs beaten well into the sugar. 
Beat the whites to a stiff froth, and add them in alternate spoonfuls with 
the rest of the flour ; then beat a long time, and bake as soon as done. 

Plain Cake raised with Eggs. — Take a pound or quart of flour, half 
as much sugar, half, as much butter as sugar, four or five eggs, one nut- 
meg, and a tea-spoonful of cinnamon. Mix well the sugar, butter, yelks, 
and spice ; then the flour, and last the whites as stiff froth. 

These two cakes are varied by adding citron, fruit, or other spices, 
making them more or less rich. 

Frult-Cake. — This to be made either like pound-cake, with fruit added ; 
or like plain cake, raised with eggs or yeast, adding fruit. 

Walnut-meats or Almonds may be chopped and put in the cake instead 
of fruit, making another variety. 

Huckleberry-Cake. — One quart of huckleberries, three cups of sugar, 
three cups of flour, six eggs, one cup of sweet milk, and one tea-spoonful 
of soda dissolved in a little "hot water. Cream the butter and sugar, and 
add the beaten yelks. Then add the milk, flour, and two grated nutmegs. 
Then add the whites, whipped to a stiff froth, and the berries, gently, so 
as not to mash them. An excellent cake. 

Currants and other berries may be used in the same way. If very sour, 
add more sugar. If doubtful of raising it enough, add a tea-spoonful of 
soda ; or, more surely, a bit of sal volatile the size of a hickory-nut. 

Gold and Silver Cake. — This makes a pretty variety when cut and 
placed together in a cake-dish. For each, take one cup of sugar, (for the 
silver, white ; and for the gold, brown,) half a cup of butter, half a cup of 
milk, two cups of flour, one tea-spoonful of cream tartar, and half as much 



CAKE. 501 

soda. For the one, use the yelk of three eggs ; and the white, as stiff 
froth, for the other. Mix the cream tartar very thoroughly in the flour, 
and put in the soda last. Bake immediately. This makes one loaf of 
each kind, in flat pans, and is to be frosted. If more is wanted, double 
the quantity of each ingredient. 

Rich Sponge-Cake. — Take twelve eggs, and the weight of ten in 
sugar, and six in flour. 

Beat the sugar into the yelks, add the juice and grated peel of one 
lemon, then the flour, and then the whites cut to a stiff froth, and bake as 
soon as possible. Bake in hrick-shaped pans, and line them with buttered 
paper. , 

Plain Sponge-Cake, (easily made.) — Mix thoroughly two cups of sifted 
flour and two cups of white sugar with one tea-spoonful of cream tartar. 
Beat four eggs to a froth, not separating the whites, and add some grated 
lemon-peel, or nutmeg, or rose-water. Just before baking, add half a tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in three great-spoonfuls of warm water. Beat 
quick, and set in the oven immediately. 

GrSTGEEBRBAD, FEIED CAKES, COOKIES, AND OTHER CAKES. 

Annt Esther's Gingerbread. — Take half a pint of molasses, a small 
cup of soft butter, a gill and a half of water, a heaping tea-spoonful of 
soda dissolved in a table-spoonful of hot water, and one even table-spoon- 
ful of strong ginger, or two if weak. Bub butter and ginger into the flour, 
add the water, soda, and molasses, and while doing it, put in two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. Boll it in cards an inch thick, and bake half an 
hour in a quick oven. 

Sponge Gingerbread. — Add to the above two beaten eggs, and water 
to make it thin as pound-cake, and bake as soon as well mixed. 

Ginger-Snaps and Seed-Cookies. — One cup of butter, two cups of 
sugar or molasses, one cup of water, one table-spoonful of ginger, one 
heaping tea-spoonful of cinnamon and one of cloves, one tea-spoonful of 
soda dissolved In a small cup of hot water. Mix and add flour for a stiff 
dough, roll and cut in small round cakes Omit the spices, and put in 
four or five table-spoonfuls of caraway seeds, and you have seed-cakes 
Leave out all spice and seeds, and you have plain cookies. 

Fried Cakes.— For doughnuts, use the recipe for Plain Sponge-Cake, 
adding flour enough to roll. Or take Plain Cake raised with eggs, and 
add flour enough to roll. Or take Dough-Cake, or Plain Loaf-Cake, and 
thicken so as to roll. Roll about half an inch thick and cut into oblong 
pieces. For crullers, take plain cake raised with eggs, and thicken stiff 
with flour ; roll it thin, and cut into strips, and form twisted cakes. More 
sugar and butter make it richer, but less healthful. 



508 THE HOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Have plenty of lard, or, better, strained teef-fat, quite hot ; try with a 
small piece first, and, if right, there will he a bubbling. Turn two or 
three times to cook all alike, break open one to try if done, and when 
done, take up with a skimmer and drain well. If the fat is too hot, it will 
brown too quick ; if not hot enough, the fat will soak into the cake. Re- 
member that frying is the most unhealthful mode of cooking food, and 
the one most likely to be done amiss. 

CAKE RAISED WITH YEAST. 

Plain Loaf-Cake. — Two pounds of dried and sifted flour, a- pint of 
warm water in which is melted a quarter of a pound of butter, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, three eggs without beating, and three quarters of a pound 
of sugar, well mixed ; and then add two nutmegs, two tea-spoonfuls of cin- 
namon, and two gills of home-brewed or half as much distillery yeast. 
When light, add two or three pounds of fruit, and let it stand half an 
hour. 

Rich Loaf-Cake is made like the above, only adding more butter and 
sugar. The following are specimens of the diverse proportions : Four 
pounds of flour, three of sugar, two of butter, a quart of water or milk, 
ten unbeaten eggs, half a pint of wine, three nutmegs, three tea-spoonfuls 
of cinnamon, and two cloves ; two gills of distillery yeast, or twice as 
much home-brewed. This is what in New-England would be called 
Election or Commencement-Cake. Two or three risings used to be prac- 
ticed, but one is as good if the mixing is thorough. 

Dough-Cake. — Three cups of raised dough, half a cup of butter, two 
cups of sugar, two eggs^fruit and spice to the taste. When light, bake 
in loaves. This can be made more or less sweet and shortened by lessen- 
ing or increasing the quantity of dough. It must be mixed with the 
hands. 

Icing for Cake. — Put the whites of eggs into a dish, and for each egg • 
use about a quarter of a pound of sugar. Beat the whites, slowly adding 
the sugar. This is better than beating the whites first, and then adding 
sugar. A little lemou-j uice or tartaric acid makes it whiter and better. 
Spread the icing, after pouring it upon the centre, with a knife dipped in 
water. If you can, dry in an open, suu;iy window. Otherwise, harden it 
in the oven. It improves it by mixing, when adding sugar, some almonds 
pounded to a thin paste.

PEBSEEVBS AND JELLIES. 

General Directions. 

Gathee fruit wten it is dry. 
Long boiling hardens the fruit. 

Pour boiling water over the sieves used,, and wring out jelly- 
bags in hot water the moment you are to use them. 
Do not squeeze while straining through jelly-bags. 
Let the pots and jars containing sweetmeats just made, re- 
main uncovered three days. 

For permanent covering, lay brandy papers over the top, 
cover them tight, and seal them ; or, what is best of all, soak 
a split bladder and tie it tight over them. In drying, it will 
shrink so as to be perfectly air-tight. 
Keep them in a dry but not warm place. 
A thick, leathery mold helps to preserve fruit, but when 
mold appears in specks, the preserves must be scalded in a 
warm oven, or the jars containing them are to be set into hot 
water which must then boil till the preserves are scalded. 

Always keep watch of preserves which are not sealed, espe- 
cially in warm and damp weather. The only sure way to keep 
them without risk or care is to make them with enough sugar 
and seal them or tie bladder covers over. 

The best kettle is iron lined with porcelain. If brass is used, 
it must be bright, or acids will make a poison. 

The chief art is to boil continuously, slowly, and gently, 
and take up as soon as done ; too long boiling makes the 
fruit hard and dark. Jellies will not harden well if the boil- 
ing stops for some minutes. Try jellies with a spoon, and 
as soon as they harden around the edge quickly, they are

done. In making, the sugar should be heated and not added 
till the juice boils. ' 

Keep preserves in small glass jars, as frequent opening in- 
jures them. 

Canned Fruit. — Thia is far more economical than to preserve in sugar. 
Some can be canned without any sugar, and very nice sugar demands 
only one fourth sugar to three fourths fruit. The best cans are glass 
with metal tops. Those of Wilcox are the best known to the author. 
The W. L. Imlay's of Philadelphia are recommended as best of any. 

Directions. — Set the jars in a large boiler, and then fill it with cold 
water and heat to boiling. Having filled the jars to within an inch of 
the top with alternate layers of fruit and sugar, (in proportion of one half 
or one fourth of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, according as it is 
more or less acid,) set them in cold water. As soon as the fruit has risen 
to the top of the jar, screw on the cover and take from the water. 
Peaches and pears may be canned without sugar. 

To clarify Syrup for Sweetmeats' — ^For each pound of sugar allow 
half a pint of water. For every three pounds of sugar allow the white of 
one egg. Mix when cold, boil a few minutes, and skim it. Let it stand 
ten minutes and skim it again, then strain it. 

Brandy Peaclies. — Prick the peaches with a needle, put them into a 
kettle with cold water, heat the water, scald them until suflBcieritly soft 
to be penetrated with a straw. Take half a pound of sugar to every 
pound of peaches ; make the syrup with the sugar, and while it is a 
little warm mix two thirds as much of white brandy with it, put the 
fruit into jars and pour the syrup over it. The late white clingstones are 
the best to use. 

Peaches, (not very rich.) — To six pounds of fruit put five of sugar. 
Make the syrup. Boil the fruit in the syrup till it is clear. If the fruit ' 
is ripe, half an hour will cook it sufficiently. 

Peaches, (very elegant.) — First take out the stones, then pare them. 
To every pound of peaches allow one third of a pound of sugar. Make 
a thin syrup, boil the peaches in the syrup till tender, but not till they 
break. Put them into a bowl and pour the syrup over them. Put them 
in a dry, cool place and let them stand two days. Then make a new, rich 
syrup, allowing three quarters of a pound of sugar to one of fruit. Drain 
the peaches from the first syrup, and boil them until they are clear in thf) 
last syrup. The first syrup must not be added, but may be used for any 
other purpose you please, as it is somewhat bitter. The large whitt 
clingstones are the best. 

To preserve Quinces wliole. — Select the largest and fairest quincesj 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. ' 511 

(as the poorer ones will answer for jelly.) Take out the cores and pare 
them. Boil the quinces in water till tender. Take them out separately 
on a platter. To each pound of quince allow a pound of sugar. Make 
the syrup, then boil the quinces in the syrup until clear. 

Quince Jelly. — Rub the quinces with a cloth until perfectly smooth. 
Remove the cores, cut them into smMl pieces, pack them tight in your 
kettle, pour cold water on them until it is on a level with the fruit, but 
not to cover it ; boil till very soft, but not till they break. Dip off 
all the liquor you can, then put the fruit into a sieve and press it, and 
d rain off' all the remaining liquor. Then to a pint of the liquor add a pound 
of sugar and boil it fifteen minutes Pour it, as soon as cool, into small 
jars or tumblers. Let it stand in the sun a few days, till it begins to dry 
on the top. It will continue to harden after it is put up. 

CalPs Foot Jelly. — To four nicely cleaned calf's feet put four quarts 
of water ; let it simmer gently till reduced to two quarts, then strain It 
and let it stand all night. Then take 6ff all the fat and sediment, melt 
it, add the j uice, and put in the peel of three lemons and a pint of wine, 
the whites of four eggs, three sticks of cinnamon, and sugar to your 
taste. Boil ten minutes, then skim out the spice and lemon-peel and 
strain it. 

The American gelatine, now very common, makes as good jelly, with 
far less trouble ; and in using it, you only need to dissolve it in hot water, 
and then sweeten and flavor it. • 

To preserve Apples. — Take only tart and well-flavored apples ; peel 
and take out the cores without dividing them, and then parboil them. 
Make the syrup with the apple water, allowing three quarters of a pound 
of white sugar to every pound of apples, and boil some lemon-peel and 
juice in the syrup. Pout the syrup, while boiling, upon the apples, turn 
them gently while cooking, and only let the syrup simmer, as hard boil- 
ing breaks the fruit. Take it out when the apple is tender through. At 
the end of a week, boil them once more in the syrup. 

Pears. — Take out the cores, cut off the stems, and pare them. Boil the 
pears in water till they are tender. Watch them that they do not break. 
Lay them separately on a platter as you take them out. To each pound 
of fruit take a pound of sugar. Make the syrup, and boil the fruit in the 
syrup till clear. 

Pineapples, (very fine.) — Pare and grate the pineapple. Take an equal 
quantity of fruit and sugar. Boil them slowly in a sauce-pan for half an 
hour. 

Purple Plums, No. 1. — Make a rich syrup. BoU the plums in the 
syrup very gently till they begin to crack open. Then take them from 



512 THE EOUSEKEEPBR'S MANUAL. 

tlie syrup into a jar, and pour the syrup over them. Let them stand a 
few days, and then boil them a second time very gently. 

Purple Plnms, No. 2. — Take an equal -weight of fruit and nice brown 
sugar. Take a clean stone jar, put in a layer of fruit and a layer of sugar 
tiU all is in. Cover them tightly with dough, or other tight cover, and 
put them in a brick oven after you have baked in it. If you bake in the 
morning, put the plums in the oven at evening, and let them remain till 
the next morning. When you bake again, set them in the oven as be- 
fore. Uncover them and stir them carefully with a spoon, and so as not 
to break them. Set them in the oven thus tlie third time, aud they will 
be sufficiently cooked. 

White or Green Plums. — Put each one into boiling water and rub oflF 
the skin. Allow a pound of fruit to a pound of sugar. Make a syrup of 
sugar and water. Boil the fruit in the syrup until clear— about twenty 
minutes. Let the syrup be cold before you pour it over the fruit. They 
can be preserved without taking off the skins by pricking' them. Some 
of the kernels of the stones boiled in give a pleasant flavor. 

Citron Melons. — Two fresh lemons to a pound of melon. Let the 
sugar be equal in weight to the lemon and melon. Take out the pulp of 
the melon and cut it in thin slices, and boil it in fair water tiU tender. 
Take it out and boil the lemon in the same water about twenty minutes. 
Take out the lemon, add the sugar, and, if necessary, a little more water. 
Let it boil. When clear, add the melon aud let it boil a few minutes. 

StrawbeiTies. — Look over them with care. Weigh a pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit. Put a layer of fruit on the bottom of the preserv- 
ing-kettle, then a layer of sugar, and so on till all is in the pan. Boil 
them .about fifteen minutes. Put them in bottles, hot, and seal them. 
Then put them in a box aud fill it in with dry sand. The flavor of the 
fruit is preserved more perfectly by simply packing the fruit and sugar 
in alternate layers, and sealing the jar, without cooking ; but the pre- 
serves do not look so well. 

Blackberry Jam. — Allow three quarters of a pound of brown sugar to 
a pound of fruit. Boil the fruit half an hour, then add the suo-ar and boil 
all together ten minutes. 

To preserve Currants to eat mth Meat.— Strip them from the stem. 
Boil them an hour, and then to a pound of the fruit add a pound of brown 
sugar. Boil all together fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Cherries.— Take out the stones. To a pound of fruit allow a pound of 
sugar. Put a layer of fruit on the bottom of the preserving-kettle, then 
a layer of sugar, and continue thus till all are put in. Boil till clear. 
Put them in bottles hot and seal them. Keep them in dry sand. 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 513 

CuiTants.— Strip them from the stems. Allow a pound of sugar to a 
pquud of currants. Boil them together ten minutes. Take them from 
thesyrup and let the syrup boil twenty minutes, and pour it on the fruit. 
Put them in small jars or tumblers, and let them stand in the sun a few 
days. 

Raspberry Jam, Ni. 1.— Allow a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 
Press them with a spoon in an earthen dish. Add the sugar, and boil all 
together fifteen minutes. 

Raspberry Jam, No. 2.— Allow a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 
Boil the fruit half an hour or till the seeds are soft. Strain one quarter 
of the fruit and throw away the seeds. Add the sugar and boil the 
whole ten minutes. A little currant-juice gives it a pleasant flavor, and 
when that is used, an equal quantity of sugar must be added. 

Currant Jelly. — Pick over the currants with care. Put them in a stone 
jar, and set it into a kettle of boiling water. Let it boil till the fruit is 
very soft. Strain it through a sieve. Then run the juice through a 
jelly-bag. Pat a pound of sugar to a pint of juice, and boil it together 
five minutes. . Set it u the sun a few days. If it stops boiling, it is less 
likely to turn to je 

Qnince Marmalade. — Rub the quinces with a cloth, cut them in quar- 
ters. Put them on the fire with a little water, and stew them till they 
are sufiiciently tender to rub them through a sieve. When strained, put 
a pound of sugar to a pound of the pulp. Set it on the fire, and let it 
cook slowly. To ascertain when it is done, take out a little and let it get 
cold, and if it cuts smoothly, it is done. 

Crab-apple marmalade is made in the same way. 

Crab-apple jelly is made like quince jelly. 

Most other fruits are preserved so much like the preceding that it is 
needless to give any more particular directions than to say that a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit is the general rule for all preserves that are 
to be kept through warm weather and a long time. 

Pi-eserred Watermelon Rinds*— This a fine article to keep well with- 
out trouble for a long time. Peel the melon, and boil it in just enough 
water to cover it till it is soft, trying with a fork. (If you wish it green, 
put green vine-leaves above and Below each layer, and scatter powdered 
alum, less than half a tea-spoonful to each pound.) 

Allow a pound of sugar to each pound of rind, and clarify it as directed 

previously. 

Simmer the rinds two hours in this syrup, and flavor it with lemon- 
peel grated and tied in a bag. Then put the melon in a tureen, and boil 
the syrup till it looks thick, and pour it over. Next day, give the syrup

another boiling, and put the juice of one lemon to eacn quart of syrup. 
Take care not to make it bitter by too much of the peel. 

Citrons are preserved in the same manner. Both these keep through 
hot weather with very little care in sealing and Keeping. 

Preserved Pumpkin. — Cm a thick yellow pumpkin, peeled, into strips 
two inches wide and iive or six long. 

Take a pound of wliite sugar for each pound of fruit, and scatter it over 
the fruit, and pour on two wine-glasses of lemon-juice for each pound of 
pumpkin. 

Next day, put the parings of one or two lemons with the fruit and 
sugar, and boil the whole three quarters of an hour, or long enough to 
make it tender and clear without breaking. Lay the pumpkin to cool, 
strain the syrup, and then pour it on to the pumpkin. 

If there is too much lemon-peel, it will be bitter.

DBSSEETS AND EVENING PAETIES. 

Ice-Cream.— One quart of milk. One and a half table-spoonfuls of 
arrowroot. The grated peel of two lemons. One quart of thick cream. 

Wet the arrow-root with a little cold milk, and add it to the quart of 
milk when boiling hot : sweeten it very sweet with white sugar, put 
in the grated lemon-peel, boil the whole, and strain it into the quart of 
cream. When partly frozen, add the juice of the two lemons. Twice 
this quantity is enough for thirty-five persons. Find the quantity of 
sugar tliat suits you by measure, and then you can use this every time, 
without tasting. Some add whites of eggs ; others think it just as good 
without. It must be made very sweet, as it loses much by freezing. 

If you have no apparatus for freezing, (which is almost indispensable,) 
put the cream- into a tin pail with a very tight cover, mix equal quanti- 
ties of snow and blown salt, (not the coarse salt,) or of pounded ice and 
salt, in a tub, and put it as high as the pail, <yr freezer ; turn the pail or 
freezer half round and back agaiu with one hand, for half an hour, or 
longer, if you want it very nice. Three quarters of a hour steadily will 
make it good enough. While doing this, stop four or five times, and mix 
the frozen part with the rest, the last time very thoroughly, and then the 
lemon-j nice must be put in. Then cover the freezer tight with snow and 
Bait till it is wanted, The mixture must be perfectly cool before being 
put in the freezer. Renew the snow and salt while shaking, so as to 
have it kept tight to the sides of the freezer. A hole in the tub holding 
the freezing mixture, to let off the water, is a great advantage. In a tin 
pail it would take much longer to freeze than in the freezer, probably 
nearly twice as long. A long stick, like a coflfee-stick, should be used in 
scraping the ice from the sides. Iron spoons will be affected by the 
lemon-juice, and give a bad taste. 

In taking it out for use, fivsi wipe off every particle of the freezing 
mixture dry, then with a knife loosen the sides, then invert the freezer 
upon the dish in which the ice is to be served, and apply two towels 
wrung out of hot water to the bottom part, and the whole will slide out in 
the shape of a cylinder. Freezers are now sold quite cheap, and such 
as freeze in a short time. 

Strawberry Ice-Cream. — Rub a pint of ripe strawberries through a 



516 THE housekeeper's MANUAL.' 

sieve, add a pint of cream, and four ounces of powdered sugar, and freeze 
it. Other fruits may be used thus. 

Ice-Cream without Cream. — A vanilla bean or a lemon rind is first 
boiled in a quart of milk. Take out the bean or peel, and add the yelks 
of four eggs, beaten well. Heat it scalding hot, but do not boU it, stirring 
in white sugar till very sweet. When cold, freeze it. 

Fruit Ice-Cream. — Make rich boiled custard, and mash into it the soft 
ripe fruit, or the grated or cooked hard fruit, or grated pine-apples. Rub 
all through a sieve, sweeten it very sweet, and freeze it. Quince, apple, 
pear, peach, strawberry, and raspberry are all very good for this purpose. 

A Cream for stewed Fruit. — Boil two or three peach leaves, or a 
vanilla bean, in a quart of cream, or milk, till flavored. Strain and 
sweeten it, mix it with the yelks of four eggs, well beaten ; then, while 
heating it, add the whites cut to a froth. When it thickens, take it up. 
When cool, pour it oyer the fruit or preserves. 

Currant, Raspberry, or Strawberry Wliisk.— Put three gills of the 
juice of the fruit to ten ounces of crushed sugar, add the juice of a lemon, 
and a pint and a half of cream. Whisk it till quite thick, and serve it in 
jolly-glasses or a glass dish. 

Lemonade Ice, and other Ices.— To a quart of lemonade, add the 
whites of six eggs, cut to a froth, and freeze it. The juices of any fruit, 
sweetened and watered, may be prepared in the same way, and are very 
fine. 

Charlotte Russe. — One ounce of gelatine simmered in half a pint of 
milk or water, four ounces of sugar beat into the yelks of four eggs, and 
added to the gelatine when dissolved. Then add a pint of cream or new 
milk. Lastly, add the whites beat to a stiflF froth, and beat all together. 
Line a mold with slices of sponge-cake and set it on ice, and when the 
cream is a little thickened, fill the mould ; let it stand five or six hours, 
and then turn it into a dish. 

Flummery. — Cut sponge-cake into thin slices, 'and line a deep dish. 
Make it moist with white wine ; make a rich custard, using only the 
yelks of the eggs. When cool, turn it into the dish, and cut the whites 
to a stiff froth, and put on the top. 

Chicken Salad. — Cut the white meat of chickens into small bits the 
size of peas. Chop the white parts of celery nearly as small. 

Prepare a dressing thus : rub the yelks of hard-boiled eggs smooth, to 
each yelk put half a tea-spoonful of liquid mustard, the same quantity of 
salt, a table-spoonful of oil mixed in very slowly and thoroughly, and half 



DESSERTS AND EVENING PARTIES. 517 

• a Wine-glass of vinegar. Mix the chicken and celery in a large bowl 
and pour over this dressing. ' 

The dressing must not be put on tUl just before it is used. Bread and 
butter and crackers are served with it. 

Wine Jelly.— Two ounces of American isinglass or gelatine. One 
quart of boiling water. A pint and a half of white wine. The whites of 
three eggs. 

Soak the gelatine in cold water half an hour. Then take it from the 
water, and pour on the quart of boiling water. When cooled, add the 
grated rind of one lemon, and the juice of two, and a pound and a half 
of loaf-sugar. Then beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and stir 
them in, and let the whole boil till the egg is well mixed, but do not stir 
while it boils. Strain through a jelly .bag, and then add the wine. 

In cold weather, a pint more of water may be added. This jelly can 
be colored by beet-juice, saffron, or indigo, for fancy dishes. 

An Apple Lemon Puddlug.— Six spoonfuls of grated, or of cooked and 
strained, apple. Three lemons, pulp, rind, and juice, all grated. Half a 
pound of melted butter. Sugar to the taste. Seven eggs well beaten. 

Mix, and bake with or without paste. It can be made still plainer by 
using nine spoonfuls of apple, one lemon, two thirds of a cup full of but 
ter, and three eggs. 

Wheat Flour Blanc>Mang:e. — Wet up six table-spoonfuls of flour to a 
thin paste with cold milk, and stir it iato a pint of boiling milk. Flavor 
with lemon-peel or peach-leaves boiled in the milk. Add a pinch of 
salt, cool it in a, mold, and eat with sweetened cream and sweetmeats. 

Orange Marmalade. — Take two lemons and a dozen oranges ; grate 
the yellow rinds of all the oranges but five, and set it aside. Make a clear 
syrup of an equal weight of sugar. Clear the oranges of rind and seeds, 
put them with the grated rinds into the syrup, aiid boil about twenty 
minutes till it is a transparent mass. 

A simple Lemon Jelly, (easily made.) — One ounce of gelatine. A 
pound and a half of loat-sugar. Three lemons, pulp, skin, and juice, 
grated. 

Pour a quart of boiling water upon the isinglass, add the rest, mix and 
strain it, then add a glass of wine, and pour it to cool in some regular 
form. If the lemons are not fresh, add a little cream of tartar or tartaric 
acid. 

Cranberry. — Pour boiling water on them, and then you can easily 
separate the good and the bad. Boil them in a very little water till soft 
then sweeten to your taste. If you wish a jelly, take a portion and strain 
t'r rough a fine sieve. 



518 THE BOUSBKEEPER' S MANUAL. 

Apple Ice, (very fine.) — Take finely-flavored apples, grate tliem fine, 
and then make tliem very sweet, and freeze them. It is very delicious. 

Pears, peaches, or quinces also are nice, either grated fine or stewed and 
run through a sieve, then sweetened very sweet, and frozen. The flavor 
is much better preserved when grated than when cooked. 

Whip 8yllabab. — One pint of cream. Sifted white sugar to your 
taste. Half a tumbler of white wine. The grated rind and j nice of one 
lemon. Beat all to a stiff froth, 

Apple Snow. — Put six very tart apples in cold water over a slow flre. 
When soft, take away the skins and cores, and mix in a pint of sifted 
white sugar ; beat the whites of six eggs to a stifl" froth, and then add 
them to the apples and sugar. Put it in a dessert-dish and ornament 
with myrtle and box. 

Iced Fruit. — Take fine bunches of currants on the stalk, dip them in 
well-beaten whites of eggs, lay them on a sieve and sift white sugar over 
them, and set them in a warm place to dry. 

Ornamental Froth. — The whites of four eggs in a stiff froth, put into 
the syrup of preserved raspberries or strawberries, beaten well together, 
and turned over ice-cream or blanc-mange. Make white froth to com- 
bine with the colored in fanciful ways. It can be put on the top of boil- 
ing milk, and hardened to keep Its form. 

To clarify Isinglass. — ^Dissolve an ounce of isinglass in a cup of boil- 
ing water, take off the scum, and drain through a coarse cloth. Jellies, 
candies, and blanc-mange should be done in brass and stirred with silver. 

Blanc-Mange. — Two and a half sheets of gelatine broken into one 
quart of milk ; put in a warm place and stir till it dissolves. An ounce and 
a half of clarified isinglass stirred into the milk. Sugar to your taste. 
A tea-spoonful of fine salt. Flavor with lemon, or orange, or rose-water. 
Let it boil, stirring it well, then strain it into molds. 

Three ounces of almonds pounded to a paste and added while boiling 
is an improvement. Or filberts or hickory-nuts can be skinned and used 
thus. It can be flavored by boiling in it a vanilla bean or a stick of cin- 
namon. (Save the bean to use again.) 

Apple Jelly. — Boil tart peeled apples in a little water till glutinous ; 
strain out the juice, and put a pound of white sugar to a pint of the juice. 
Ilavor to your taste, boil till a good jelly, and then put it into molds. 

Orange Jelly. — The juice of nine oranges and three lemons. The 
grated rind of one lemon, and one orange, pared thin. Two quarts of 
water, and four ounces of gelatine broken up and boiled in it to a jelly. 
Add the above, and sweeten to your taste. Then add the whites of eight 



DUSSEMTS AND EVENING PARTIES. 519 

eggs, well beaten to u. stiff froth, and boil ten minutes ; strain and put 
mto molds, first dipped in cold water. When perfectly cold, dip the 
mold in warm water, and turn on to a glass dish. 

Floating Island.— Beat the yelks of six eggs with the juice, of four 
lemons, sweeten it to your taste, and stir it into a quart of boiling milk 
till it thickens, then pour it into a dish. Whip the whites of the eggs to 
a stiff froth, and put it on the top of the cream. 

A Dish of Snow.— Grate the white part of cocoa-nut, put it in a glass 
dish and serve with oranges sliced and sugared, or with currant or cran- 
berry jellies. 

To clarify Sugar.— Take four pounds of sugar, and break it up. 
Whisk the white of an egg, and put it -with a tumblerful of water into a 
preserving-pan, and add water gradually till you have two quarts, 
stirring well. When there is a good frothing, throw in the sugar, boil 
moderately, and skim it. If the sugar rises to run over, throw in a little 
cold water, and then skim it, as it is then still. Kepeat this, and when 
no more scum rises, strain the sugar for use. 

Candied Frnits.— Preserve the fruit, then dip it in sugar boiled to 
candy thickness, and then dry it Grapes and some other fruits may be 
dipped in uncooked, and then dried, and they are fine. 

Another Way. — Take it from the syrup, when preserved, dip it in 
powdered sugar, and set it on a sieve in an oven to dry. 

To make an Ornamental Pyramid for a Table.— Boil loaf-sugar as 
' for candy, and rub it over a stiff form made for the purpose, of stiff paper 
or pasteboard, which must be well buttered. Set it on a table, and begin 
at the bottom, and stick on to this frame with the sugar, a row of maca- 
roons, kisses, or other ornamental articles, and continue till the whole is 
covered. When cold, draw out the pasteboard form, and set the pyra- 
mid in the centre of the table with a small bit of wax candle burning 
with it, and it looks very beautifully.

DRINKS AKD ARTICLES FOR THE SICK ATn> TOUN'& CHILDREN. 

Drinks made of tKe juice of fruits and -water are good for 
all who are in health. Various preparations of cocoa-nuts are 
so also. Tea is often made or adulterated with unhealthful 
articles. Coffee is usually drank so strong as to injure children 
and grown persons of delicate constitution. All alcoholic 
drinks are dangerous, because they are so generally mixed with 
harmful matter, and because they so often lead to excess, and 
then to ruin. The common-sense maxim is, when there is dan- 
ger, choose the safest course. The Christian maxim is, " We 
that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and' 
not to please ourselves." 

Obedience to these two maxims would save thousands of 
young children and delicate persons from following the dan- 
gerous example of those " that are strong." 

To make Tea, — The safest tea is the black, as less stimulating than 
green ; both excite the brain and nerves when strong. The chief 
direction is to have water boiling hot. First soak the tea in a very little 
hot water, and then add boiling water. 

To make Coffee. — Roast it slowly in a tight vessel, and so it can be 
stirred often. To roast all equally a dark brown and have none burnt, is 
the main thing. Keep it in a tight box, or, better, grind it fresh when 
used. Clear it by putting into it, when making, a fresh egg-shell crush- 
ed, or the white of an egg, or a small bit of fish-skin. Some filter, and 
some boil ; and there are coiSfee-pots made for each method, and some 
that require nothing put in to clear the coffee. The aroma is retained 
just in proportion as the coffee is confined, both before making and also 
while making. 

Fish-skin for Coffee. — Take it from codfish before cooking ; have it 
nice and dry. Cut in inch squares, and take one for two quarts of coffee. 



DRINKS FOR THE SICK AND YOUNQ. 521 

Cocoa. — The cracked is best. Put two table spoonfuls of it into tliree 
pints of cold water. Boil an hour for first use, save tbe remnants and 
boil it again, as it is very strong. Do ibis several times. For ground 
cocoa use two table-spoonfuls to a quart, and boil half an bour. Boil tbe 
milk by itself and add it liberally wlien taken up. For tbe shells of 
cocoa, use a heaping tea-cupful for a quart of water. Put tbenf in over 
night and boil a long time. 

Cream for Coffee and Tea. — Heat new milk and let it stand till cool 
and all tbe cream rises ; this is tbe best way for common use. To every 
pint of this add a pound and a quarter of loaf-sugar, and it will keep 
good a month or more, if corked tight in glass. 

Chocolate. — Put three table-spoonfuls when scraped to each pint, boil 
half an hour, and add boiled milk when used. 

Delicious Milk-Lemonade. — Half a pint of sherry wine and as much 
lemon-j uice, six ounces loaf-sugar, and » pint of water poured in when 
boiling. Add not quite a pint of cold milk, and strain tbe whole. 

Strawberry and Raspberry Vinegar. — Mix four pounds of the fruit 
with three quarts of cider or wine vinegar, and let them stand three 
days. Drain the vinegar through a jelly -bag and add four more pounds 
of fruit, ftnd in three days do the same. Then strain out tbe vinegar for 
summer drinks, effervescing with soda or only with water. 

White Tea, and Boys' Coffee, for Children.— Children never love tea 
and coffee till they are trained to it. They always like these drinks. 
Put two tea/-spoonful3 of sugar to half a cup of hot water, and add as 
much good milk. Or crumb toast or dry bread into a bowl with plenty 
of sugar, and add half milk to half boiling w^ter. 

Dangerous Use of Milk.— Milk is not only drink, but rich food. It 
therefore should not be used as drink with other food, as is water or tea 
and coffee. Persons often cause bilious difficulties by using milk in addi- 
tion to ordinary food as tbe chief drink. It is a well-established fact that 
some grown persons as well as young children can not drink milk, and 
in some cases can not eat bread wet with milk without trouble from it. 

Simple Drinks.— Pour boiling water on mashed cranberries, or grated 
apples, or tamarinds, or mashed currants or ra|Spberries ; pour off the water, 
sweeten, and in summer cool with ice. 

Pour boiling water on to bread toasted quite brown, or on to pounded 
parched corn, boil a minute, strain, and add sugar and cream, or milk. 

Simple Wine Whey.— Mix equal quantities of milk and boiling water, 
add wine and sweeten. 



522 THE BOUSEKEEPER'S MANUAL. 

Toast and Cider.— Take one third brisk cider and two thirds cold 
water, sweeten it, crumb in toasted bread, and grate on a little nutmeg. 
Acid jelly will do when cider is not at hand. 

Panada. — Toast two or three crackers, pour on boiling water and let it 
simmer two or three minutes, add a well-beaten egg, sweeten and flavor 
with nutmeg. 

Water Gruel. — Scald half a tumblerful of fresh ground corn-meal, add 
a table-spoonful of flour made into a paste, boil twenty minutes or more, 
and add salt, sugar, and nutmeg. Oat-meal gruel is excellent made thus. 

Beef-Tea. — ^Pepper and salt spme good beef cut into small pieces, pour 
on boiling water and steep half an hour. A better way is to put the 
meat thus prepared into a bottle kept in boiling water for four or five 
hours. 

Tomato Syrnp. — ^Put a pound of sugar to a quart of juice, bottle it and 
use for a beverage with water. 

Sassafras Jelly. — Soak the pith of sassafras till a jelly, and add a 
little sugar. 

Egg Tea, Egg Coffee, and Egg Milk. — Beat the yelk of an egg in 
some sugar and a little salt ; add either cold tea or coffee or milk. Then 
beat the whites to a stiff froth and add. Flavor the milk with wine. 
Some do not like the taste of raw egg, and so the other articles may first 
be made boiling-hot before the white is put in. 

Oat-Meal Gruel. — Four table-spoonfuls of grits, (unbolted oat-meal,) a 
pinch of salt and a pint of boiling water. Skim, sweeten, and flavor. Or 
make a thin batter of fine oat-meal, and pour into boiling water ; then 
Sweeten and flavor it. 

Pearl Barley- Water. — ^Boil two and a half ounces of pearl barley ten 
minutes in half a pint of water, strain it, add a quart of boiling water, 
boil it down to half the quantity, strain, sweeten, and flavor with sliced 
lemon or nutmeg. 

Cream Tartar Beverage. — Put two even tea-spoonfuls cream tartar, 
to a pint of boiling water, sweeten and flavor with lemon-peel. 

Rennet Whey, (good for a weak stomach after severe illness.) — Soak 
rennet two inches square one hour, add half a' gill of water and a pinch 
of salt ; then pour it into a pint of warm (not hot) milk. Let it stand 
half an hour, then cut it, and after an hour drain off the liquid. Let it 
stand awliile and drain off more whey. 

Eefreshing Drink for a Fever. — Mix sprigs of sage, balm, and sorrel 



DRINKS FOR THE SICK AND TOUNB. 523 

with, half a sliced lemon, skin on. Pour on boiling water, sweeten and 
cork it. 

Food, etc., for an Infant. — Nothing is so good as cow's milk diluted 
and made only as sweet as mother's milk. Add less water as the infant 
grows older. Use milk from the same cow, as mixed milk is not so 
good. If the child's bowels are too loose, wait a little ; if this continues, 
use boiled milk or rice-water. If constipated, a little magnesia may first 
be tried, and if it fails, call a doctor. 

No other food is so good for an infant, if it is a healthy one, as mUk. 
If it is not, the physician, and not an uneducated person, should direct. 
\ Boiled rice and rice-water are highly recommended by physicians for 
convalescents and children with summer complaints. 

Rubbing the body with the hand of a strong and healthy person is a 
great help in curing disease and restoring strength. 

Many children as well as adults are sick from over-eating, causing 
biliousness, disordered stomachs, and headaches. The safest and best 
remedy is, totai abstinence from food for a day or more, giving the 
clogged organs a chance to throw oflf the excess. 

Constipation is best cured by loose dress, exercise in fresh air, sleeping 
wa/rm with a window open, and relief from exercise, care, or labor, and 
especially by a daily towel-bath, which in cold weather should be taken 
by a fire, especially by aged or delicate persons. 

American gelatine in cholera infantum is better than farinaceous food. 

Keep a sick-room quiet, neat, orderly, and well ventilated. Change the 
garment next the skin and the bed often. Ventilate a sick-room not by 
large openings, but by a half-inch crack at the top of one window and 
at the bottom of another. An open fire is a sure mode of ventilation. 



XX. 

THE PEOVIDING AND CAEE OP FAMTLT STORES. 

The art of keeping a good table consists not in loading on 
a variety at each meal, but rather in securing a successive 
variety, a table neatly and tastefully set, and every thing that 
is on it cooked in the best manner. 

There are some families who provide an abundance of the 
most expensive and choice articles, and spare no expense in 
any respect, yet who have every thing cooked in such a miser- 
able way, and a table set in so slovenly a manner, that a person 
accustomed to a really good table can scarcely taste a morsel 
with any enjoyment. 

On the contrary, there are many tables where the closest 
economy is practiced ; and yet the table-cloth is so white and 
smooth, the dishes, silver, glass, and other table articles so 
bright, and arranged with such propriety ; the bread so 
light and sweet; the butter so beautiful, and every other ar- 
ticle of food so well cooked, and so neatly and tastefully 
served, that every thing seems good, and pleases both the eye 
and the palate. 

A habit of doing every thing in the best tnanner is of unspeak- 
able importance to a housekeeper, and every woman ought to 
f/im at it, however great the difficulties she may have to meet. 
If a young housekeeper commences with a determination to try 
to do every thing in* the best manner, and perseveres in the 
effort, meeting all obstacles with patient cheerfulness, not only 
the moral but the intellectual tone of her mind is elevated by 
ilio attempt. Although she may meet many insuperable diffi- 
culties, and may never reach the standard at which she aims, 
the simple ejffort, persevered in, will have an elevating influence 
on her character; while, at the same time, she actually will 



PROVIDING AND CARE OF FAMILY STORES. 525 

reach a point of excellence far ahead of those who, discouraged 
by many obstacles, give up in despair, and resolve to make no 
more eflforts, and let things go as they will. The grand dis- 
tinction between a noble and an ignoble' mind is, that one will 
control circumstances ; the other yields, and allows circum- 
stances to control her. 

It should be borne in mind that the constitution of man de- 
mands a variety of food, and that it is just as cheap to keep 
on hand a good variety of materials in the store-closet, so as 
to make a frequent change, as it is to buy one or two articles 
at once, and live on them exclusively, till every person is 
tired of them, and then buy two or three more of another 
kind. 

It is too frequently the case that families fall into a very 
limited round of articles, and continue the same course from 
one year to another, when there is a much greater variety 
within reach of articles which are just as cheap and as easily 
obtained, and yet remain unthought of and untouched. 

A thrifty and generous provider will see that her store-closet 
is furnished with such a variety of articles that successive 
changes can be made, and for a good length of time. To aid 
in this, a slight sketch of a well-provided store-closet will be 
given, with a description of the manner in which each article 
should be stored and kept, in order to avoid waste and injury. 
To this will be added modes of securing a successive variety 
within the reach of all in moderate circumstances. ' 

It is best to have a store-closet open from the kitchen, be- 
cause the kitchen fire keeps the atmosphere dry, and this pre- 
vents the articles stored from molding, and other injury from 
dampness. Yet it must not be kept warm, as there are many 
articles which are injured by warmth. 

A cool and dry place is indispensable for a store-room, and 
a small window over the door, and another opening out-doors, 
give a great advantage, by securing coolness and circulation 
of fresh aii-. 

Flour should be kept in a barrel, with a flour-scoop to dip 
it, a sieve to sift it, and a pan to hold the sifted flour, either in 
the barrel or close at hand. The barrel should hg,ve a tight 



526 TSJE aOUSEKEEFEI^ S MANUAL. 

cover to keep out mice and vermin. It is best to find, by trial, 
a lot of first-rate flour, and then buy a year's supply. , But this 
should not be done unless there are accommodations for keep- 
ing it dry and cool, arid protecting it from vermin. 

Unbolted flour should be stored in kegs or covered tubs, 
and always be kept on hand as regularly as fine flour. It 
should be bought only when freshly ground, and only in mo- 
derate quantities, as it loses sweetness by keeping. 

Indian meed should be purchased in small quantities, say 
fifteen or twenty pounds at a time, and be kept in a covered 
tub or keg. It is always improved by scalding. It must be 
kept very cool and dry, and if occasionally stirred, is preserved 
more surely from growing sour or musty. Fresh ground is 
best. 

Hye should be bought in small quantities, say forty or fifty 
pounds at a time, and be kept in a keg or half-barrel, with a 
cover. 

Buckwheat, Rice, Hominy, and Ground Rice must be pur- 
chased in small quantities, and kept in covei-ed kegs or tubs. 
Several of these articles are infested with small black insects, 
and examination must occasionally be made for them. 

Arrowroot, Tapioca, Sago, Pearl Barley, Pearl Wheat, 
Cracked Wheat, American Isinglass, Macaroni, Vermicelli, 
and Oat-meal are all articles which help to make an agreeable 
variety, and it is just as cheap to buy a small quantity of 
each as it is to buy a larger quantity of two or three articles. 
Eight or ten pounds of each of these articles of food can be 
stored in covered jars or covered wood boxes, and then they 
are always at hand to help to make a variety. All of them 
are very healthful food, and help to form many delightful 
dishes for desserts. Some of the most healthful puddings are 
those made of rice, tapioca, sago, and macaroni ; while isin- 
glass, or American, gelatine, forms elegant articles for desserts, 
and is also excellent for the sick. 

Sugars should not be bought by the barrel, as the brown is 
apt to turn to molasses, and run out on to the floor. Refined 
loaf for tea, crushed sugar for the nicest preserves and to use 
with fruit, nice brown sugar for coffee, and common brown for 



PROVIDING AND CASE OF FAMILY STORES. 527 

more common use. The loaf can be stored in the papers on a 
slielf. The others should be kept in close covered kegs, or 
covered wooden articles made for the purpose. 

Sutter must be kept in the dryest and coldest place you 
can find, in vessels of either stone, earthen, or -wood, and never 
in tin. 

Lard and Drippings must be kept in a dry, cold place, and 
should not be salted. Usually the cellar is the best place for 
them. Earthen or stone jars are the best to store them in. 

Salt must be kept in the dryest piace that can be found. 
Mock salt is the best for table-salt. It should be washed, 
dried, pounded, sifted, and stored in a glass jar, and covered 
close. It is common to find it growing damp in the salt-stands 
for the table. It should then be set by the fire to diy, and 
afterward be reduced to fine powder again. Few things are 
more disagreeable than coarse or damp salt on a table. 

Vinegar is best made of wine or cider. Buy a keg or half- 
barrel of it, and set it in the cellar, and then keep a supply for 
the casters in a bottle in the kitchen. If too strong, it eats 
the pickles. Much manufactured vinegar is sold that ruins 
pickles, and is unhealthful. 

Pickles never must be kept in glazed wai-e, as the vinegar 
forms a poisonous compound with the glazing. 

Oil must be kept in the cellar. Winter-strained must be 
got in cold weather, as the summer-strained will not burn 
except in warm weather. Those who use kerosene-oil should 
never trust it with heedless servants or children. Never fill 
lamps with it at night, nor allow servants to kindle fire with 
it, or to fill a lamp with it when lighted. Inquire for the 
safest pattern of lamps, and learn all the dangers to be avoided, 
and the cautions needful in the use of this most dangerous ex- 
plosive oil. Neglect this caution and you probably will be a 
sorrowful mourner all your life for the sufierings or death of 
some dear friend. 

Molasses, if bought by the barrel, or half-barrel, should be 
kept in the cellar. If bought in small quantities, it should be 
kept in a demijohn. No vessel should be corked or bunged, 



528 THE BOUSBKMBPER'S MANUAL. 

if filled with molasses, as it will swell and burst the vessel, or 
run over. 

Sard Soap should be bought by large quantity, and laid to 
harden on a shelf in a very dry place. It is much more econo- 
mical to buy hard than soft soap, as those who use soft soap 
ai"e very apt to waste it in using it, as they can not do with 
hard soap. 

Starch it is best to buy by a large quantity. It comes very 
nicely put up in papers, a pound or two in each paper, and 
packed in a box. The high-priced starch is cheapest in the 
end. 

Indigo is not always good. When a good lot is found by 
trial, it is best to get enough for a year or two, and store it in 
a tight tin box. 

Coffee it is best to buy by the bag, as it improves by keep- 
ing. Let it hang in the bag in a dry place, and it loses its 
rank smell and taste. It is poor economy to buy ground cof- 
fee, as it often has other articles mixed, and loses flavor by 
keeping after it is ground. 

Tea, if bought by the box, is several cents a pound cheaper 
than by small quantities. If well put Up in boxes lined with 
lead, it keeps perfectly ; but put up in paper, it soon loses its 
flavor. It therefore should, if in small quantities, be put up 
in glass or tin, and shut tight. 

Soda should be bought in small quantities, then powdered, 
sifted, and kept tight corked in a large-mouth glass bottle. It 
grows damp if exposed to the air, and then can not be used 
properly. 

Jtaisins should not be bought in large quantities, as they are 
injured by tiine. It is best to buy the small boxes. 

Currants for cake should be prepared, and set by for use in 
a jar 

Lemon and Orange-peel should be dried, pounded, and set 
up in corked glass jars. 

Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves, Mace, and Allspice should be 
pounded fine, and corked tight in small glass bottles, with 
mouths large enough for a junk-bottle cork, and then put in a 
tight tin box, made for the purpose. Or they can be put in 



PROVIDING AND CAIiM OF FAMILY STORES. 529 

small tin boxes with tight covers. Essences are as good as 
spices. y^ 

Sweet Serbs should be dried, the stalks thrown away, and 
the rest be kept in corked large-mouth bottles, or small tin 
boxes. 

Cream Tartar, Citric and Tartaric Acids, Hicarhonate of 
Soda, and Essences should be kept in corked glass jars. Sal 
volatile must be kept in a large-mouth bottle, with a ground- 
glass stopper to make it air-tight. Use cold water in dissolving 
it. It must be powdered. 

I*reserves and Jellies should be kept in glass or stone, in a 
cool, dry place, well sealed, or tied with bladder covers. If 
properly made and thus put up, they never will ferment. If it 
is difficult to find a cool, dry j)lace, pack the jars in a box, and 
fill the interstices with sand, very thoroughly dried. It is best 
to put jellies in tumblers, or small glass jars, so as to open 
only a small quantity at a time. 

The most easy way of keeping Hams perfectly is to wrap 
and tie them in paper, and pack them in boxes or barrels with 
ashes. The ashes must fill all interstices, but must not touch 
the hams, as it absorbs the fat. It keeps them sweet, and pro- 
tects from all kinds of insects. 

After smoked beef or hams are cut, hang them in a coarse 
linen bag in the cellai-, and tie it up to keep out flies. 

Keep Cheese in a cool, dry place, and after it is cut, wrap it 
in a linen cloth, and keep it in a tight tin box. 

Keep Bread in a tin covered box, and it will keep fresh and 
good longer than if left exposed to the air. 

Cake also should be kept in a tight tin box. Tin boxes made 
with covers like trunks, with handles at the ends, are best for 
bread and cake. 

Smoked herring keep in the cellar. 

Codfish is improved by changing it, once in a while, back 
and forth from garret to cellar. Some dislike to have it in the ' 
house anywhere. 

All salted provision must be watched, and kept under the 
brine. When the brine looks bloody, or smells badly, it must 
be scalded, and more salt put to it, and poured over the meat. 



XXI. 

ON SETTING TABLES, AND PREPARING VARIOUS ARTICLES OF 
FOOD FOE THE TABLE. 

To a person accustomed to a good table, tlie manner in which 
the table is set, and the mode in which food is prepared and 
set on, has a great influence, not only on the eye, but the ap- 
petite. A housekeeper ought, therefore, to attend carefully to 
these particulars. 

The table-cloth should always be white, and well washed 
and ironed. When taken from the table, it should be folded 
in the ironed creases, and some heavy article laid on it. A 
heavy bit of plank, smoothed and kept for the purpose, is use- 
ful. By this method, the table-cloth looks tidy much longer 
than when it is less carefully laid aside. 

When table-napkins are used, care should be taken to keep 
the same one to each person, and in laying them aside, they 
should be folded so as to hide the soiled places, and laid under 
pressure. It is best to use napkin-rings. 

The table-cloth should always be put on square, and right 
side upward. The articles of table furniture should be 
placed with order and symmetry. 

The bread for breakfast and tea should be cut in even, regu- 
lar slices, not over a fourth of an inch thick, and all crumbs 
removed from the bread-plate. Thgy should be piled in a 
regular form, and if the slices are large they should be di- 
vided. 

The butter should be cooled in cold water, if not already 
hard, and then cut into a smooth and regular form, and a but- 
ter-knife be laid by the plate, to be used for no other purpose 
but to help the butter. 

A small plate should be placed at each plate for butter, and 



ON SETTING TABLES. 531 

a small salt-cup set by each breakfast or dinner-plate. This 
saves butter and salt. 

All the flour should be wiped from small cakes, and the 
crumbs be kept from the bread-plate. 

In preparing dishes for the dinner-table, all water should be 
carefully drained from the vegetables, and the edges of the 
platters and dishes should be made perfectly clean and neat. 

All soiled spots should be removed from the outside of 
pitchers, gravy-boats, and every article used on the table ; the 
handles of the knives and forks must be clean, and the knives 
bright and sharp. 

In winter, the plates and all the dishes used, both for meat 
and vegetables, should be set to the fire to warm, when the 
table is being set, as cold plates and dishes cool the vegetables, 
gravy, and meats, which by many is deemed a great injury. 

Cucumbers, when prepared for table, should be laid in cold 
water for an hour or two to cool, and then be peeled and cut 
into fresh cold water. Then they should be drained, and 
brought to the table, and seasoned the last thing. 

The water should be drained thoroughly from all greens and 
salads. 

There are certain articles which are usually set on together, 
because it is the fashion, or because they are suited to each 
other. 

Thus, with strong-flavored meats, like mutton, goose, and 
duck, it is customary to serve the strong-flavored vegetables, 
such as onions and turnips. Thus, turnips are put in mutton 
broth, and served with mutton, and onions are used to stuff 
geese and ducks. But onions are usually banished from the 
table and from cooking on account of the disagreeable flavor 
they impart to the atmosphere and breath. 

Boiled Poultry should be accompanied with boiled ham or 
tongue. 

Boiled Rice is served with poultry as a vegetable. 

Jelly is served with mutton, venison, and roasted meats, and 
is used in the gravies for hashes. 

Fresh Pork requires some acid sauce, such as cranberry, or 
tart applesauce. 



532 THE housekeeper's MANUAL. 

Drawn Butter^ prepared as in the recipe, with eggs in it, is 
used with boiled fowls and boiled fish. 

Pickles are served especially with fish, and Soy is a fashion- 
able sauce for fish, which is mixed on the plate ,with drawn 
butter. 

There are modes of garnishing dishes, and j)i'eparing them 
for table, which give an air of taste and refinement that pleases 
the eye. Thus, in preparing a dish of fricasseed fowls, or 
stewed fowls, or cold fowls warmed over, small cups of boil- 
ed nee can be laid inverted around the edge of the platter, to 
eat with the meat. 

On Broiled Sam or Veal, eggs boiled or fried, and laid one 
on each piece, look well. 

Greens and Asparagus should be well drained, and laid on 
buttered toast, and then slices of boiled eggs be laid on the 
top and around. 

Hashes and preparations of pigs' and calves' head and feet 
should be laid on toast, and garnished with round slices of 
lemon. 

Curled Parsley, or Oommon Parsley, is a pretty garnish, to 
be fastened to the shank of a ham, to conceal the bone, and 
laid around the dish holding it. It looks well laid around any 
dish of cold slices of tongue, ham, or meat of any kind. 

In setting a tea-table, small-sized plates are set around, with 
a knife, napkin, and buttei'-plate laid by each in a regular 
manner, while the articles of food are to be set, also, in regular 
order. On the waiter are placed tea-cups and saucers, sugar- 
bowl, slop-bowl, cream-cup, and two or three articles for tea, 
cofiee, and hot water, as the case may be. On the dinner-table, 
by each plate, is a knife, fork, napkin, and tumbler; and small 
butter-plate and salt-cup shovdd also be placed by each plate. 



XXII. 

"WASHING, IRONING, AND CLEANSING. 

Many a woman without servants, or with those untrained, 
must do her own washing and ironmg, or train others to do it, 
and this is the most trying department of housekeeping. The 
following may aid in lessening labor and care. 

It saves washing and is more healthful to use flannel shirts. 
Farmers, sailors, and soldiers have found, by experience, that 
they are more comfortable than cotton or linen, even in the 
hottest days. Many gentlemen use them for common wear, 
changing to a cotton-flannel night-gown for sleeping. So 
young children can have a flannel jacket and flannel drawers 
sewed to the jacket in front, and buttoned behind, and change 
them at night for cotton-flannel made in the same way. The 
under-garments for women may be made of the same material 
and pattern, and this will save washing and promote health. 

Some ladies economize time and labor by wearing three- 
cornered lace articles for the neck, trimmed with imitation Va- 
lenciennes lace, wash them in their wash-bowl, whiten in soap- 
suds in a tumbler or bowl in their window, stiffen with gum- 
arabic, and after stretching, press under weights between clean . 
papers. This is a happy contrivance when on a journey or 
without servants. Those who wish to save all needless labor 
in washes should have under-garments and night-gowns made 
in sack forms or other fashions that save in both material and 
liibor. They also should omit ruffles and other trimmings that 
increase the labor of ironing. 

There is nothing which tends more effectually to secure good 
washing than a full supply of all conveniences. A plenty of 
soft water is a very important item. "When this can not be had, 
lye or soda can be put in hard water, to soften it. Borax is 



534 THE SOUSEKEEPEB'S MANUAL. 

safer than soda, wliich turns white clothes yellow, and injures 
texture. Buy crude borax, and for a common washing use half 
an ounce. A borax soap is made thus : To a pound of bar- 
soap, cut in small pieces, put a quart of hot. water and an 
ounce of powdered borax. ' Heat and mix, but do not boil, cool 
and cut into cakes, and use like hard soap. Soak the white 
clothes in a suds made of this soap over night, and it saves 
much rubbing. Two wash-forms' are needed ; one for the two 
tubs in which to put the suds, and the other for blueing and 
starching-tubs. Four tubs, of different sizes, are necessary; 
also, a large wooden dipper, (as metal is apt to rust ;) two or 
three pails ; a grooved wash-board ; a clothes-line, (sea-grass 
or horse-hair is best ;) a wash-stick to move clothes when 
boiling, and a wooden fork to take them out. Soap-dishes, 
made to hook on the tubs, save soap and time. Provide, also, 
a clothes-bag, in which to boil clothes; an indigo-bag, of 
double flannel; a starch-strainer, of coarse linen; a bottle of 
ox-gall for calicoes ; a supply of starch, neither sour nor musty ; 
several dozens' of clothes-pins, which are cleft sticks, used to 
fasten clothes on the line ; a bottle of dissolved gum-arabic ; 
two clothes-baskets ; and a brass or copper kettle, for boiling 
clothes, as iron is apt to rust. A closet for keeping all these 
things is a great convenience. Tubs, pails, and all hooped 
wooden ware, should be kept out of the sun, and in a cool place, 
or they will fall to pieces. 

COMMON MODB OP WASHING. 

Assort the clothes, and put those most soiled in soak the 
night before. Never pour hot water on them, as it sets the 
dirt. In assorting clothes, put the flannels in one lot, the 
colored clothes in another, the coarse white ones in a third, and 
the fine clothes in a fourth lot. Wash the fine clothes in one 
tub of suds. When clothes are very much soiled, a second 
suds is needful, turning them wrong side out. Put them in the 
boiling-bag, and boil them in strong suds for half an hour, and 
not much more. Move them, while boiling, with the clothes- 
stick. Take them out of the boiling-bag, and put them into a 
tub of water, and rub the dirtiest places again, if need be. 



WASHING, IRONING, AND CLEANSING. 535 

Throw them into the rinsing-water, and then wring them out, 
and put them into the blueing-water, l-'ut the articles to be 
stiffened into a clothes-basket, by themselves, and just before 
hanging out, dip them in starchy clapping it in, so as to have 
them equally stiff in all parts. Hang white clothes in the sun 
and colored ones (wrong side out) in the shade. Fasten them 
with cfothes-pins. Then wash the coarser white articles in the 
s^me manner. Then wash the colored clothes. These must 
not be soaked, nor have lye or soda put in the water, and they 
ought not to lie wet long before hanging out, as it injures their 
colors. Beefs-gall, one spoonful to two pailfuls of suds, im- 
proves calicoes. Lastly, wash the flannels in suds as hot as 
the hand can bear. Never rub on soap, as this shrinks them 
in spots. Wring them out of the first suds, and throw them 
into another tub of hot suds, turning them wrong side out. 
Then throw them into hot blueing-water. Do not put blueing 
into Buds, as it makes specks in the flannel. Never leave 
flannels long in water, nor put them in cold or lukewarm 
water. Before hanging them out, shake and stretch them. 
Some housekeepers have a close closet, made with slats across 
the top. On these slats, they put their flannels, when ready to 
hang out, and then burn brimstone under them, for ten minutes. 
It is but little trouble, and keeps the flannels as white as new. 
Wash the colored flannels and hose, after the white, adding 
m^ore hot water. Some persons dry woolen hose on stocking- 
boards, shaped like a foot and leg, with strings to tie them on 
the line. This keeps them from shrinking, and makes them 
look better than if ironed. It is also less work than to iron 
them properly. 

Bedding should be washed in long days, and in hot weather. 
Empty straw beds once a year. 

The following cautions in regard to calicoes are useful. 
Never wash them in very warm water ; and change the water 
when it appears dingy, or the light parts will look dirty. 
Never rub on soap; but remove grease with French-chalk, 
starch, magnesia, or Wilmington clay. Make starch for black 
calicoes with coffee-water, to prevent any whitish appearance. 
Glue is good for stiffening calicoes. When laid aside, not to 



536 THM housekeeper's MANUAL. 

be used, all stiffening sliould be washed out, or they -will often be 
injured. Never let calicoes freeze in drying. Some persons 
use bran-water, (four quarts of wheat-bran to two pails of 
water,) and no soap, for calicoes ; washing and rinsing in the 
bran-water. Potato-water is equally good. Take eight peeled 
and grated potatoes to one gallon of water. 

To Cleanse Gentkmenh Broadcloths. — The best way, which 
the writer has repeatedly tried with unfailing success, is the 
following : Take one beefs-gall, half a pound of saleratus, and 
four gallons of warm water. Lay the article on a table, and 
scour it thoroughly, in every part, with a clothes-brush, dipped 
in this mixture. The collar of a coat, and the grease-spots, 
(previously marked by stitches of white thread,) must be re- 
peatedly brushed. Then, take the article, and rinse it up and 
down in the mixture. Then rinse it up and down in a tub of 
soft cold water. Then, without wringing or pressing, hang it 
to drain and dry. Fasten a coat up by the collar. "When 
perfectly dry, it is sometimes the case, with coats, that noth- 
ing more is needed. In other cases, it is necessary to dampen 
with a sponge the parts which look wrinkled, and either pull 
them smooth with the fingers, or press them with an iron, 
having a piece of bombazine or thin woolen cloth between 
the ii'on and the article. 

TO MANUFACTUEE LTE, SOAP, STAEOH, AND OTHER ARTICLES 
USED IN WASHING. 

To mahe Lye. — Provide a large tub, made of pine or ash, 
and set it on a form, so high that a tub can stand under it. 
Make a hole, an inch in diameter, near the bottom, on one side. 
Lay bricks inside about this hole, and straw over them. To 
every seven bushels of ashes add two gallons of unslacked 
lime, and throw in the ashes and lime in alternate layers. 
"While puttii^g in the ashes and lime, pour on boiling water, 
using three or four pailfuls. After this, add a pailful of cold 
soft water once an hour, till all the ashes appear to be well 
soaked. Catch the drippings in a tub and try its strength 
with an egg. If the egg rise so as to show a circle as large as 
a ten-cent piece, the strength is right ; if it rise higher, the lye 



WASHING, IRokma, AND CLEANSTNG. 537 

must be weakened by water ; if not so high, the ashes are not 
good, and the whole process must be repeated, putting in fresh 
ashes, and running the weak lye through the new ashes, with 
some additional water. Quick-lye is made by poui-ing one 
gallon of boiling soft water on three quarts of ashes, and 
straining it. Oak ashes are best. 

To make Soft ^oop.— Save all drippings and fat, melt them, 
and set them away in cakes. Some persons keep, for soap- 
grease, a half-barrel, with weak lye in it, and a cover over 
it. To make soft soap, take the proportion of one pailful of 
lye to three pounds of fat- Melt the fat, and pour in the lye, 
by degrees. Boil it steadily, through the day, till it is ropy. 
If not boiled enough, on cooling it will turn to lye and sedi- 
ment. While boiling, there should always be a little oil on the 
surface. If this does not appear, add more grease. If there 
is too much grease, on cooling, it will rise, and can be skimmed 
off. Try it, by cooling a small quantity. When it appears like 
jelly on becoming cold, it is done. It must then be put in a 
cool place and often stirred. 

To make cold Soft Soap, melt thirty pounds of grease, put it 
in a barrel, add four pailfuls of strong lye, and stir it up tho- 
roughly. Then gradually add more lye, till the barrel is nearly 
full, and the soap looks about right. 

To make Potash-Soap, melt thirty-nine pounds of grease, 
and put it in a barrel. Take twenty-nine pounds of light ash- 
colored potash, (the reddish-coioredL will spoil the soap,) and 
pour hot water on it ; then pour it off into the grease, stirring 
it well. Continue thus till all the potash is melted. Add one 
pailful of cold water, stirring it a great deal every day, till the 
barrel be full, and then it is done. This is the cheapest and 
best kind of soap. It is best to sell ashes and buy potash. 
The soap is better, if it stand a year before it is used ; there- 
fore make two barrels at once. 

To prepare Starch. — Take four table-spoonfuls of starch; 
put in as much water, and rub it, till all lumps are removed. 
Then add half a cup of cold water. Pour this into a quart of 
boiling water, and boil it for half an hour, adding a piece of 
spermaceti, or a lump of salt or sugar, as large as a hazel-nut. 



538 THE HOUSEKBEPER S MANUAL. 

Strain it, and put in a very little blueing. Thin it with hot 
water. 

Beefs- Gall. — Send a junk-bottle to the butcher, and have 
several gall-bladders emptied into it. Keep it salted, and in a 
cool place. Some persons perfume it ; but fresh air removes 
the unpleasant smell which it gives, when used for clothes. 

DIEBCTIONS POK STAECHING MUSLINS AND LACES. 

Many ladies clap muslins, then dry them, and afterward 
sprinkle them. This saves time. Others clap them till nearly 
dry, then fold and cover, and then iron them. Iron wrought 
muslins on soft flannel, and on the wrong side. 

To do up Laces nicely, sew a clean piece of muslin around 
a long bottle, and roll the lace on it ; pulling out the edge, and 
rolling it so that the edge will turn in, and be covered as you 
roll. Fill the bottle with water, and then boil it for an hour in 
a suds made with white soap. Rinse it in fair water, a little 
blue ; dry it in the sun ; and, if any stiffening is wished, use thin 
starch or gum-arabic. When dry, fold and press it between 
white papers in a large book. It improves the lace to wet it 
with sweet-oil, after it is rolled on the bottle, and before boil- 
ing in the suds. Blond laces can be whitened by rolling them 
on a bottle in this way, and then setting the bottle in the sun, 
in a dish of cold suds made with white soap, wetting it tho- 
roughly, and changing the suds every day. Do this for a 
week or more ; then rinse in fair water ; dry it on the bottle 
in the sun and stiffen it with white gum-arabic. Lay it away 
in loose folds. Lace vails can be whitened by laying them in 
flat dishes, in suds made with white soap ; then rinsing, and 
stiffening them with gum-arabic, stretching them, and pinning 
them a sheet to dry. 

ARTICLES TO BE PEOVTDBD EOE lEONING. 

Provide the following articles: A w;oolen ironing-blanket, 
and a linen or cotton sheet to spread over it ; a large fire, of 
charcoal and hard wood, (unless furnaces or stoves are used;) 
a hearth free from cinders and ashes, a piece of sheet-iron, in 



WASHING, IRONING, AlA> CLEANSING. 539 

front of the fire, on which to set the irons while heating; 
(this last saves many black spots from careless ironers ;) three 
or four holders, made of woolen, and covered with old silk, 
as these do not easily take fire ; two iron rings or iron-stands, on 
which to set the irons, and small pieces of board to put under 
them, to prevent scorching the sheet ; linen or cotton wipers j 
and a piece of bees-wax, to rub on the irons when they are 
smoked. There should be, at least, three irons for each person 
ironing, and a small and large clothes-frame, on which 'to air 
the fine and coarse clothes. It is a great saving of space as 
well as labor to have a clothes-frame made with a large num- 
ber of slats, on which to hang clothes. Then have it fastened 
to the wall, and, when not used, pushed flat against the wall. 
Any carpenter can understand how to make this. 

A bosom-board, on which to iron shirt-bosoms, should be 
made, one foot and a half long and nine inches wide, and 
covered with white flannel. A skirt-board on which to iron 
frock-skirts, should be made, five feet long and two feet wide 
at one end, tapering to one foot and three inches wide at the 
other end. This should be covered with flannel ; and will save 
much trouble in ironing nice dresses. The large end may be 
put on the table, and the other on the back of a chair. Both 
these boards should have cotton covers made to fit them, and 
these should be changed and washed when dirty. These 
boards are often useful, when articles are to be ironed or 
pressed in a chamber or parlor, and where economy of space 
is needful, they may be hung to a wall or door by loops on 
the covers. Provide, also, a press-board, for broadcloth, two 
feet long and four inches wide at one end, tapering to three 
inches wide, at the other. 

If the lady of the house will provide all these articles, see 
that the fires are properly made, the ironing-sheets evenly put 
on and properly pinned, the clothes-frames dusted, and all 
articles kept in their places, she will do much toward securing 
good ironing. 



540 TSE HOUSflKEBPEli S MANUAL. 

OW SPEESTKLUSTG, POLDnSTG, AND IRONING. 

Wipe the dust from the ironing-board, and lay it down, to 
receive the clothes, which should be sprinkled with clear 
and warm water, and laid in separate piles, one of colored, one 
of common, and one of fine articles, and one of flannels. Fold 
the fine things, and roll them in a towel, and then fold the 
rest, turning them all right side outward. The colored clothes 
should be laid separate from the rest, and ought not to lie long 
damp, as it injures the colors. The sheets and table-linen 
should be shaken, stretched, and folded by two persons. 

Iron lace and needle-work on the wrong side, and carry them 
away as soon as dry. Iron calicoes with irons which are not 
very hot, and generally on the right side, as they thus keep 
clean for a longer time. In ironing a frock, first do the waist, 
then the sleeves, then the skirt. Keep the skirt rolled, while 
ironing the other parts, and set a chair, to hold the sleeves 
while ironing the skirt, unless a skirt-board be used. In iron- 
ing a shirt, first do the back, then the sleeves, then the collar 
and bosom, and then the front. Iron silk on the wrong side, 
when quite damp, with an iron which is not very hot, as light 
colors are apt to change and fade. Iron velvet, by turning up 
the face of the iron, and after dampening the wrong side of the 
velvet, draw it over the face of the iron, holding it straight 
and not biased. 

TO WHITEN ARTICLES, AND REMOVE STAINS FROM THEM. 

"Wet white clothes in suds, and lay them oq the grass, in the 
sun. It will save from grass stain, to have a clean white cloth 
under the articles to be whitened. Lay muslins in suds made 
with white soap, in a flat dish ; set this in the sun, changing 
the suds every day. Whiten tow-cloth or brown linen by 
keeping it in lye through the night, laying it out in the sun, 
and wetting it with fair water, as fast as it dries. 

Scorched articles can often be whitened again, by laying 
them in the sun, wet with suds. Where this does not answer, 
put a pound of white soap in a gallon of milk, and boil the 
article in it. Another method is, to chop and extract the juice 



WASHING, mONING, AND CLEANSING. 541 

from two onions, and boil this with half a pint of vinegar, an 
ounce of white soap, and two ounces of fuller's earth. Spread 
this, when cool, on the scorched part, and, when dry, wash it 
off, in fair water. Mildew may be removed by dipping the 
article in sour butterniilk, laying it in the sun, and, after it is 
white, rinsing it in fair water. Soap and chalk are also good ; 
also, soap and starch, adding half as much salt as there is 
starch, together with the juice of a lemon. Stains in linen can 
often be removed by rubbing on soft soap, then putting on a 
starch paste and drying in the sun, renewing it several times. 
Wash off all the soap and starch, in cold, fair water. 

M T X TTTBES FOR REMOVING STAINS AND GREASE. 

Stain-Mixture. — Half an ounce of oxalic acid in a pint of soft water. 
This can be kept in a corked bottle and is infallible in removing iron- 
rust and ink-stains. It is very poisonous. The article must be spread 
■with this mixture over the steam of hot water, and wet several times. 
This will also remove indelible ink. The article must be washed, or the 
mixture will injure it. 

Another Stain-Mixture is made, by mixing one ounce of sal ammo- 
niac, one ounce of salt of tartar, and one pint of soft water. 

To remove Grease. — Mix four ounces of fuller's earth, half an ounce 
of pearlash, and lemon-juice enough to make a stiflF paste, which can be 
dried in balls, and kept for use. Wet the greased spot with cold water, 
rub it with the ball, dry it, and then rinse it with fair cold water. This is 
for white articles. For silks, and worsteds, use French-chalk, which can 
be procured of the apothecaries. That which is soft and white is best. 
Scrape it on the greased spot, under side, and let it lie for a day and 
night. Then brush oflf that used and renew it, till the spot disappears- 
Wilmington clay-balls are equally good. Ink-spots can often be removed 
from white clothes by rubbing on common tallow, leaving it for a day 
or two, and then washing as usual. Grease can be taken out of wall-pa- 
per, by making a paste of potter's clay, water, and ox-gall, and spreading 
it on the paper. When dry, renew it, till the spot disappears. 

Stains on floors, from soot or stove-pipes can be removed by washing 
the spot in sulphuric acid and water. Stains, in colored silk dresses 
can often be removed by pure water. Those made by acids, tea, wine, 
and fruits can often be removed by spirits of hartshorn, diluted with an 
equal quantity of water. Sometimes it must be repeated several times. 

Tar, Pitch, and Turpentine can be removed, by putting the spot in 



542 THE housekeeper's MANUAL. 

sweet-oil, or by spreading tallow on it, and letting it remain for twenty- 
four hours. Then, if the firticle be linen or cotton, wash it as usual ; if 
it be silk or worsted, rub it with ether or spirits of wine. 

Lamp-Oil can be removed from floors, carpets, and other articles, by 
spreading upon the stain a paste made of fuller's earth or potter's cla;^, ■ 
brushing off and renewing it, when dry, till the stain is removed. If gali 
be put into the paste, it will preserve the colors from injury. When the 
stain has been removed, carefully brush off the paste with a soft brush. 

Oil-Paint can be removed by rubbing it with very pure spirits of tur- 
pentine. The impure spirits leave a grease-spot. Wax can be removed 
by scraping it off, and then holding a red-hot poker near the spot. Sper- 
maceti may be removed by scraping it off, then patting a paper over the 
spot, and applying a warm iron. If this does not answer, rub on spirits 
of wine. 

Ink-Stains in carpets and woolen table-covers can be removed by 
washing the spot in a liquid composed of one tea-spoonful of oxalic acid 
dissolved in a tea-cupful of warm (not hot) water, and then rinsing in cold 
water. When ink is first spilled on a woolen carpet, pour on water im- 
mediately, and sop it up several times, and no stain will be made. Often 
on other articles, a stream of cold water poured on the under side of the 
ink-spot will so dilute the ink that it can be rubbed out in cold water. 

Stains on Yamislied Articles, which are caused by cups of hot water, 
can be removed by rubbing them with lamp-oil, and then with alcohol. 
Ink-stains can be taken out of mahogany by one tea-spoonful of oil of 
vitriol mixed with one table-spoonful of water, or by oxalic acid and 
water. These must be brushed over quickly, and then washed off with 
milk. 

Silk Handkereliiefs and Ribbons can be cleansed, by using French- 
chalk to take out the grease, and then sponging them on both sides 
with lukewarm fair water. Stiffen them with gum-arabic, and press 
them between white paper, with an iron not very hot. A table-spoonful 
of spirits of wine t(.»three quarts of water improves It. 

SUk Hose or SUk Gtlovej should be washed in warm suds made with 
white soap, and rinsed in cold water ; they should then be stretched and 
rubbed with a hard rolled flannel, till they are quite dry. Ironing them 
very much injures their looks. Wash-leather articles should have the 
grease removed from them by French-chalk or magnesia; they should 
then be washed in warm suds, and rinsed in cold water. Light Kid 
Gloves should have the grease removed from them, and then wash them 
on the hands with borax water and soft flannel— a tea-spoonful to a tum- 
bler of water. Then stretch a,nd press them. Dark Kid Gloves wash in 
the same way.

MISCEIXAISTEOXTS ABTIGE AND EECIPES. 

How to keep cool in hot TVeatlier.— Sit in a room covered with 
matting or without any carpet, and keep the floor wet with pure water 
and a watering-pot. In hot nights, place a double wet sheet on the bed 
and a woolen blanket over it, and it will cool the bed which is heated 
through the day, and does not cool as fast as the evening air. A hot bed 
is often the cause of sleeplessness. Wear wristlets and anklets of wet 
flannel. Shut all doors and windows early in the morning to keep in 
cool air, and let in air only through windows that are on the shady side 
of the house. If chambers open upon the hot roofs of piazzas or porticos, 
cover them with clean straw or hay, and wet them with a watering- 
pot. In all these cases, the heat is taken from the air and from all sur- 
rounding things by the absorption of heat as the water changes to vapor. 

Indelible Ink. — Put six cents' worth of lunar caustic in a small vial, 
and fill with rain-water. To prepare the cloth, put a great-spoonful of 
gum-arabic into a larger bottle, with a drachm of salt of tartar, fill with 
water, and when dissolved, wet the cloth, and press it smooth with a 
warm (not hot) iron. Put the articles, when marked, in the sun. 

To preserve Eggs.— ^Pack eggs in a jar small end downward, and then 
pour in a mixture of four quarts of slacked lime, two table-spoonfuls of 
cream tartar and two of salt. This will cover about nine dozen for seve- 
ral months. 

To prevent Earthen, Glass, and Ironware from being easily Broken. 

— Put them in cold water, and heat till boiling, and cool gradually. 

A Good Cement for Broken Earthen and Glass.— Mix Russian isin- 
glass in white brandy, forming a thick jelly when cool. Strain and cork. 
When using it, rub it on the broken edges, and hold them together 
three or four minutes. 

To keep Knives from Knst and other Injury.— Rub bright, and 
wrap in thick brown paper. Never let knife-handles lie in water, and 
do not let their blades stay in very hot water, as the heat expands the 
iron, and makes handles crack. 



544 TRE housekeeper's majvual. 

To cleanse or renovate Furniture. — White spots on furniture re- 
move by camphene, or sometimes by oil or spirits of turpentine. Remove 
mortar spots with warm vinegar, and paint-spots with camphene or 
burning-fluid. Powdered pumice-stone is better than sand to clean paint. 
To polish unvarnished furniture, rub on two ounces of bees-wax, half an 
ounce of alconet root, melted together, and, when cooled, two ounces of 
spirits of wine, and half a pint of spirits of turpentine. 

To clean Silver. — Wet whiting vrith liquid hartshorn, and this will 
remove black spots. Or boil half an ounce of pulverized hartshorn in a 
pint of water, and pour it into rags, dry them, and use to cleanse silver. 
Polish with wash-leather. 

To cleanse Wall-Paper. — Wipe with a clean pillow-case on a broom, 
and brush gently. Rub bad spots with soft bread-crumbs gently. 

To purify a WeU. — Get out the water, and then put in three or four 
quarts of quick-lime. Any well long unused should be thus cleansed. 

How to treat Koses and other Plants. — Water them daily with 
water steeped in wood-ashes. To destroy slugs, scatter ashes over the 
plant at night before the dew falls, or before a coming shower. Water 
all plants with washing-day suds, and it makes them flourish. Scatter 
salt in gravel walks to get out grass and weeds. Use old brine for this 
purpose. Use saw-dust to manure plants ;' also wood-ashes ; even that 
used to make lye is good. 

Easy Way to keep Orapes. — When not dead ripe, have them free 
from dampness, take out the decayed, and wrap each bunch in cotton, 
putting only two layers in a box. Keep in a dry, cool room, where they 
will not freeze. 

Snow for Eggs. — Two table-spoonfuls of snow strewed in quickly, 
and baked immediately, is equal to one egg in puddings or pan-cakes. 

Paper to keep Preserves. — Soft paper dipped in the white of an egg 
is the best cover for jellies and pickles. Turn it over the rim. 

To make Butter cool in liot Weather. — Set it on a bit of brick, cover 
with a flower-pot, and wrap a wet cloth around the pot. The evaporation 
cools it as well as ice. 

To stop Cracks in Iron. — Mix ashes and common salt and a little 
water, and fill the cracks. 

To stop Creaking Hinges.— Put on oil. 

To stop Creaking Doors and make Drawers slide easily. — Rub on 

hard soap. 



MISCELLANEOUS ADVICE AND RECIPES. 545 

To renovate Black Silk. — Wash in cold tea or coffee, witli a little 
sugar in them. Put in a little ink if very rusty. Drain and do not wring 
and iron on tlie wrong side. 

Another Way to clean Kid ©lores. — Bub tliem lightly with ben- 
zine, and as they dry, with pearl-powder. Expose to the air to remove 
the smell. 

To remove Grease-Spots. — Put an ounce of powdered borax to a quart 
of boiling water. Wash with this, and keep it corked for further use. 

To get rid of Rats and Mice. — A cat is the best remedy. Another 
is to half fill a tub with water, and sprinkle oats and meal on the top. 
For a wliile they will be deceived, j ump in, and be drowned or caught. 

ODDS AXD ENDS. 

There are certain odds and ends where every housekeeper 
will gain much by having a regular time to attend them. Let 
this time be the last Saturday forenoon in every month, or any 
other time more agreeable ; but let there be a regular fixed time 
once a month in which the housekeeper will attend to the fol- 
lowing things : 

First. Go around to every room, drawer, and closet in the 
house, and see what is out of order, and what needs to be 
done, and make arrangements as to time and manner of 
doing it. 

Second. Examine the store-closet, and see if there is a proper 
supply of all articles needed there. 

Third. Go to the cellar, and see if the salted provision, 
vegetables, pickles, vine'^ar, and all other articles stored in the 
cellar are in proper order, and examine all the preserves and 
jellies. 

Fourth. Examine the trunk or closet of family linen, and see 
what needs to be repaired and renewed. 

Fifth. See if there is a supply of dish-towels, dish-cloths, 
bags, holders, floor-cloths, dust-cloths, wrapping-paper, twine, 
lamp-wicks, and all other articles needed in kitchen work. 

Sixth. Count over the spoons, knives, and forks, and examine 
all the various household utensils, to see what need replacing, 
and what should be repaired. 

Seventh. Have in a box a hammer, tacks, pincers, gimlets, 



546 THE BOUSMKEEJPBR^ S MANUAL. 

nails, screws, screw-driver, small saw, and two sizes of chisels 
for emergencies when no regular workman is at hand. Also 
be prepared to set glass. Every lady should be able in emer- 
gency to do such jobs herself. 

A housekeeper who will have a regular time for attending 
to these particulars will find her whole family machinery 
moving easily and well ; but one who does not, will constantly 
be finding something out of joint, and an unquiet, secret ap- 
prehension of duties left undone or forgotten, which no other 
method will so effectually remove. 

A housekeeper will often be much annoyed by the accumu- 
lation of articles not immediately needed, that must be saved 
for future use. The following method, adopted by a thrifty 
housekeeper, may be imitated with advantage. She bought 
some cheap calico, and made bags of various sizes, and wrote 
the following labels with indelible ink on a bit of broad tape, 
and sewed them on one side of the bags : Old Linens, Old Cot- 
tons, Old Black Silks, Old Colored Silks, Old Stockings, Old 
Colored Woolens, Old Flannels, New Linsn, JVew Cotton, JVew 
Woolens, New Silks, Pieces of Dresses, Pieces of Boys^ Clothfis, 
etc. These bags were hung around a closet, and filled with 
the above articles, and then it was known where to look for 
each, and where to put each when not in use. 

Another excellent plan, for the table, is for a housekeeper once 
a month to make out a bill of fare for the four weeks to come. 
To do this, let her look over this book, and find out what kind 
of dishes the season of the year and her own stores will enable 
her to provide, and then make out a list of the dishes she will 
provide through the month, so as to have an agreeable variety 
for breakfasts, dinners, and suppers. Some systematic ar- 
rangement of this kind at regular periods will secure great 
comfort and enjoyment to a family.. 



XXIV. 

THE LAWS OF HEALTH AND HAPPmESS. 

EvEET housekeeper should well consider the following, 
which are latos of health, taught by learned physiologists and 
physicians, and also by a widely recorded experience. They 
are also the laws of happiness, inasmuch as health is indispen- 
sable to happiness. Furthermore, they are laws of God, inas- 
much as he has made us to be happy ; and so whatever lessens 
our highest happiness is contrary to his will and wishes, and 
sore penalties follow disobedience. 

Laws of Health for tJie Bone's. — As the nutrition and 
strength of the bones depend upon it, take care to exercise 
daily in pure air. Never allow the spine to be habitually out 
of its natural position in sitting or sleeping, as thus distortion 
and disease are induced. Never allow clothing to compress 
the bones of the chest or ribs, as this lessens both lung and ab- 
dominal breathing, lessens the needful amount of oxygen, and 
thus debilitates the whole body. Always have all clothing 
supported from the shoulders, so as never to press upon the 
abdomen, and thus duninish or stop abdominal respiration on 
■which good health so much depends. Do not wear high heels, 
as it tends to internal displacements, and also to distort the 
ankles and spine. It also distorts the foot, causes bunions 
and corns, while it makes a graceful walk impossible. 

Laws of Health for the Muscles. — Be careful that the blood 
which nourishes the muscles has the proper supply of pure air 
from the lungs, and of healthful nutriment from the stomach. 
Take care that all the muscles are brought to full size and 
strength by exercise for them all. Take care, also, that none 
of them are weakened by excess of exercise. When inactive 



548 THM BOnSEKBErER' S MANUAL. 

habits are to be changed, take care that it be done not sudden- 
ly, but by a gradual process. Never take active exercise where 
the air is impure, as it usually is in large gatherings wliere 
dancing is practiced. As light is a cause of health and 
strength, let exercise be taken by daylight, and not in the 
night. Fever compress any of the muscles by tight clothing, 
as this prevents their proper nourishment by the blood. When 
a person is too weak to exercise, let a nurse increase the flow 
of blood to the muscles by pressure and rubbing, and do it 
in fresh air. 

Laws of Health for tJie Lungs. — ^It is proved by many ex- 
periments that a full-grown man vitiates a hogshead of air 
every hour ; therefore, so ventilate every room that each in- 
mate shall have the needful pure air at this rate, especially by 
night. Take care so to dress, to sit, and to lie, that the lungs 
shall not be compressed, and thus be deprived of the needful 
nourishing oxygen. 

Laxos of Health for the Digestive Organs. — Take care to se- 
cure such a variety of food that every part has a supply of its 
peculiar nutriment — nitrogen for muscles, phosphorus for 
brain and nerves, and carbon for lungs ; and let the proportion 
follow the example given in milk, eggs, and wheat, which have 
all the elements in right proportions. In doing this, you will 
use unbolted flour rather than superfine. In selecting food, 
have reference to climate, age, and employments ; also, have 
reference to the state of health and power of digestion. Take 
care not to overtax the bodily organs by excess of food. Be 
careful to eat slowly and masticate thoroughly, as digestion is 
more perfect when the food is combined with the saliva of the 
mouth. Give four or five houi's for digestion and nutrition 
between each meal. Eat at regular hours, and do not eat be- 
tween meals. Do not engage in violent exercise till two hours 
after a meal, as this would draw the blood which supplies the 
digestive fluids from the stomach to the muscles. Gentle exer- 
cise after eating helps digestion. After very vigorous exercise 
or fatigue of any kind, rest half an hour before eating. Keep 
the skin clean by a daily bath, and its capillaries well filled 



LAWS OF HEALTM AND HAPPINESS. 549 

with blood by exercise in pure air, as one mode of promoting 
healthful digestion. Never compress the body by tight or 
heavy clothing, which diminishes respiration, and thus good 
digestion. Take all proper methods for securing a daily eva- 
cuation of the bowels. Drink freely of cold water between 
meals, and sparingly while eating, and never use stimulating 
drinks except for medicine. 

Laws of Health for the Skin. — The capillaries of the skin 
contain more blood than all the rest of the body, and more 
than half the food and drink, its nutritive part being used, is 
thrown out by the skin. Cold closes the pores through which 
this useless or injurious matter is expelled, and then the lungs, 
bo^\rels, or other organs are engorged and inflamed. Of 
course, take care to avoid this by warmth and avoidance of 
exposure to cold. When a cold is taken, an immediate and 
free perspiration is usually a remedy. 

Keep the pores of the skin open and its Capillaries filled with 
blood by rubbing the whole body with a wet towel, and drying 
it with a coarse one. Do this either on retiring or rising, and 
it is the best preventive of colds and other diseases. Bath- 
rooms and tubs are a luxury, but a wet towel is equally useful, 
and it is what all can secure. A small screen, like ' a clothes- 
frame, secures privacy, if the room be shared by others, and 
can be folded and set away when not used. 

Do not sleep in the same article next the skin that is worn 
through the day, because the absorbents of the skin will take 
back the expelled injurious matter. • 

Air bed-clothing every piorning with open windows, and 
mattresses should be beaten and exposed to sun and air. The 
white dust thus thrown out is the fine matter expelled from the 
skin. Straw beds and cotton comforters should also be often 
renewed or beaten and exposed to the air, which absorbs the 
injurious matter. 

Keep the skin warm by bathing and by exercise in pure air 
in daylight, instead of relying solely on clothing and fires. 
Wear so much clothing as will save from chills. Use cool 
■water for bathing; but invalids, the aged, and persons of weak 



650 THE MOUSEKBEFJSR' S MANUAL. 

nerves should bathe by an open fire, or in a warm room, lest 
they lose rather than gain by this practice. It is poor econo- 
my to keep an unhealthful skin. 

Avoid currents of air on any part of the body. Any dimi- 
nution of clothing should be made in the morning when the 
body is most vigorous. 

In times of epidemic or contagious diseases, keep the skin 
clean and warm, and use very nourishing food, and thus danger 
is lessened. 

Exposing the skin to air aild sunlight is one mode of pre- 
serving health and lengthening life. 

Laws of Health for the Teeth, Eyes, and Hair. — Never sleep 
till the teeth are cleaned with pure water, a brush, and a piece 
of thread or a tooth-pick to remove what lodges between the 
teeth. It would be well to do this after each meal. Avoid 
very hot food as causing decayed teeth. No tooth-powder is 
needed if these directions are obeyed. 

Accustom the eyes gradually to as much light as they can 
bear without pain. Light is healthful, especially to the eyes, 
and dark rooms make weak eyes. If the eyes are weak from 
excessive use, continue to use them, but only a little at a time, 
with intervals of rest ; for eyes, like all the rest of the body, 
grow weak by disuse. Always shade weak eyes from brilliant 
lights, especially when reading. For inflamed eyes or eyelids, 
do not use what others recommend, but consult a physician ; 
as a remedy for one may be injurious for another case. Gen- 
tle rubbing around and over the eyes draws the blood there, 
and tends to increase strength. Do it only for two minutes at 
a time, three or four times a day, and very gently. Bathing 
the eyes in cold water strengthens their nerves. 

Never use hair mixtures until some chemist has tested them 
and assures you there is no had in them. Many persons have 
had paralysis and other evils by using hair mixtures contain- 
ing lead to restore the color. Brushing and washing the skin 
of the hair, and thus bringing the blood to nourish its roots, is 
a safe and sure method, and those mixtures that seem to do 



ZAWS OF SEALTU AND BAPPINESS. 551 

good are efficacious chiefly because the directions always re- 
quire rubbing and cleansing the skin of the hair. 

Laws of Health for the Brain and Nerves. — Healthful food, 
a clean skin, and daily exercise in the open air are indispensa- 
ble. Take seven or eight hours of sleep by night and not by 
day, and when taxed by great care, labor, or sorrow, sleep 
as much as you can, for then the brain and nerves recover 
strength. 

Always have some time each day devoted to some amuse- 
ment, and this out of doors if practicable. 

Have system and order ia your employments, and let there 
be vaiiety, so that no one set of nerves be wearied and another 
set unemployed. 

Let the intellect and feelings be engaged in safe and worthy 
objects, and so exercise all the faculties as to secure a well- 
balanced mind in a healthful body. In all cases of disease, 
trust more to obedience to these rules than to medicines, which 
should be rarely used. 

Remember that these laws of health are laws of God," and 
that when you disobey them you sin against your kind hea- 
venly Father who loves you, and is grieved when you injure 
your own soul and body. Therefore, pray to be enabled to 
obey them yourselves, and to teach them to your children, 
and all under your care, both by precept and example. 



XXV. 

ADDRESS OF THE SENIOE AFTHOB TO HOUSEKEBPKES, MOTHERS, 
AND TEAOHEKS. 

Mt Dear Feiekds : I wish most fervently to save you and 
your household from the sad consequences I have sufiered from 
ignorance of the laws of health, especially those which women 
peculiarly need to understand and obey. 

God made woman to do the work of the family, and to train 
those under her care to the same labor. And her body is 
so formed that family labor and care tend not only to good 
health, but to the highest culture of mind. Read all that is 
included in our " profession," as detailed in the first part of 
this work, and see how much there is to cultivate every mental 
faculty as well as our higher moral powers. Domestic labor 
with the muscles of the arms and trunk, with intervals of seden- 
tary work, are exactly what keep all the functions of the body 
in perfect order, especially those which, at the present day, are 
most out of order in our sex. And so the women of a former 
generation, while they read and studied books far less than 
women of the present time, were better developed both in mind 
and body. 

It was my good fortune to be trained by poverty and good 
mothers and aunts to do every kind of domestic labor, and so, 
until one and twenty, I was in full enjoyment of health and 
happiness. Then I gave up all domestic employments for 
study and teaching, and in ten years, I ruined my health, while 
my younger sisters and friends sufiered in the same mistaken 
course. And my experience has been repeated all over the 
land, until there is such decay of female constitutions and 
health, as alarms, and justly alarms, every well-informed per- 



ADDRESS OF THE SENIOR AUTHOR. 553 

After twenty years of invalidism, I have been restored to 
perfect health of body and mind, and wholly by a strict obe- 
dience to the laws of health and happiness, which I now com- 
mend to your especial attention, with the hope and prayer 
that by obedience to them you may save yourselves and 
households from unspeakable future miseries. 

I wish I could give you all the evidence that I have gained 
to prove that woman's work in the household anight be so con- 
ducted as to be agreeable, tasteful, and promotive of both grace 
and beauty of person. But this never can be generally credited 
till women of high culture set the example of training their 
sons and daughters, instead of hired servants alone, to be their 
domestic helpers. 

According to the present tendency of wealth and culture, it 
is women of moderate or humble means who will train their 
own children to health and happiness, and rear prosperous 
families. Meantime, the rich women will have large houses, 
many servants, poor health, and little domestic comfort, while 
they train the children of foreigners to do family work, and in 
a way that will satisfy neither mistress nor servant ; for a wo- 
man who does not work herself is rarely able to teach others 
properly. Choose wisely, then, O youthful mother and house- 
keeper! train yourself to wholesome labor and intelligent 
direction, and be prepared to educate a cheerful and healthful 
flock of your own children. 

Your friend and well-wisher, 

Cathaeine E. Bebciiek.

Single volumes, each complete, price, S 2.50 ; full set of six volumes for S 14.50. 
Bound in half morocco, ^ 5 per vol. 

Of the first volume the .Advance, of Chicago, said : — 

" The volume is a handsome one, and is prefaced with the best portrait of Mr. 
Beecher we have ever seen. The sermons are twenty-seven in immber, the regular 
Sunday morning discourses of six months, and are a wonderful testimony, not only to 
the real goodness of heart of the great Plymouth preacher, but to the fertility of re- 
source, industry of thought, and rare ability which can keep his regular ministrations 
to such a height of average excellence." 

. ..." These corrected sermons of perhaps the greatest of living preachei-s, — a 
man whose heart is as warm and cathohc as his abilities are great, and whose sermons 
combine fidelity and Scriptural truth, great power, glorious imagination, fervid 
rhetoric, and vigorous reasoning, with intense human sympathy and robust common 
sense." — British Quarter^ Review. 

Each succeeding volume contains, also, six months' sermons (from 450 to 500 pp.) 
issued in style uniform with the First Series. The Second Series contains a fine 
interior view of Plymouth Church, The other volumes are not illustrated.
