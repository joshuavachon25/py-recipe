Low Cost Meals for High Cost Times 

MENUS FROM THE NEW YORK DIET SQUAD 

Held Under the Auspices of the Life Extension Institute, New York City 

THESE menus were served in New York City during January, 1917, and cost at that time 
approximately twenty-five cents a person per day for the three meals. The menus were planned 
for twelve young men who were in active training in the New York City police department. These 
men pledged themselves to eat nothing while on the squad except the food provided at mealtime 
by the Life Extension Institute, of which Eugene Lyman Fish, M. D., is medical director, and 
under whose direction the diet experiment was made. The average age of the men was 26. The 
average weight at the start of the experiment was 169 pounds; at the close it was 172 pounds. 

The menus form a wholesome diet for the average active individual, although as they stand 
they are not suitable for all classes of people. For sedentary people they should be modified and 
taken in small quantities. This can be done either by spending less money on the food or by 
decreasing the amount of fuel food — starches, sugars and fats — and including more fruit and green 
vegetables. 

More eggs and milk are needed for children and, if possible, more fruit and green vegetables; 
the fuel food for children, however, must not be reduced. Tea and coffee were included as conces- 
sions to the former habits of those who volunteered to take the diet experiment, but these are not 
recommended for a regular diet.

A GUIDE IN FEEDING CHILDREN 

A LITTLE child who is carefully fed in accordance with his bodily needs, as these are now 
understood, receives every day at least one food from each of the following groups: 

(1) Milk and dishes made chiefly of milk, most important of the groups as regards children's 
diet; meat, fish, poultry, eggs and meat substitutes. 

(2) Bread and other cereal foods. 

(3) Butter and other wholesome fats. 

(4) Vegetables and fruits. 

(5) Simple sweets. 

A simple rule is to make a quart of milk the basis of a child's daily food, no matter whether 
the child's age is two or ten. This does not mean that the child must drink it all; it may be 
served in puddings, custards, soups, junket, or with cereals. This, with a well-cooked cereal, an 
egg, fruit or fruit juice and a fresh green vegetable and crusty bread, gives a child the necessary 
food for his daily growth and activity. 



MY EXPERIENCES ON THE PHILADELPHIA DIET SQUAD 

By Lisella Neukom 

NOTE — The menus served to the Philadelphia diet squad were identical with those served to the 
" Rookies" in the New York experiment. Both diet squads were held under the direction of the Life Extension 

Institute. 

FIRST let me assure you that we all had enough to eat. We were not hungry between meals, 
and none of us ate a thing except what was served us at the squad table. All of us were in 
better physical condition when we stopped than when we began. When we went on the diet 
squad we just ate balanced, sane meals — meals any normal person could relish. They were meals 
to give any ordinary adult proper nourishment and keep him in good physical condition. We had 
fish, meat, pies, cake, fruits, puddings, pan cakes — in fact, all sorts of things; so you see we were 
not on a diet as sick people are put on a diet, which is the first thing most people think of when 
you say "diet" to them. 

The Philadelphia diet squad was held in the middle of a cold Eastern winter. Fresh vegetables 
were expensive; eggs were dear; butter was costly. Still we had plenty of good, wholesome 
food — three meals for twenty-five cents — because science came to the rescue. In spite of the high 
prices of certain things, the dietitian obtained food which gave us as much nourishment at much 
less cost than higher-priced foods. In order to take this message of economy to women throughout 
the nation, to show them that even in these war times they can reduce their food bills materially 
and improve their health proportionately, the Life Extension Institute plans to hold diet squads 
in every nook and corner of the country. 

The Philadelphia squad was made up of social-service workers and myself, a reporter from 
the Philadelphia Evening Ledger. We all went about our regular duties. Some of us gained in 
flesh, some of us lost, but all showed improved blood pressure, intestinal activity and general 
physical condition. No one on our squad missed a meal or was ill a day during the two weeks. 
The dietitian took the weights, kind of work the " squadders " did, the number of hours they spent 
at work and the amount of sleep they took, and then computed, according to science, how much 
food we should have, just as an engineer figures out how much coal his engine needs. It was 
seldom that we needed to go over the amount allotted, although we had the privilege of doing so 
whenever we wished. 

"Well, that may be all right," j'ou say, " but suppose you have a big, fat husband. He would 
starve on 'diet squad' fare, wouldn't he?" 

On the Philadelphia diet squad we had a man who weighed nearly two hundred pounds — an ex- 
prizefighter, and his appetite was anything but small ! He had been in the habit — for he admitted 
it was only a habit after all — of "consuming" a steak, or a huge serving of meat stew, several pota- 
toes, side dishes of vegetables and a dessert, to say nothing of large quantities of bread and butter — 
all at one meal. 

And this man told me, after eating on the squad, that he had never realized how futile it had 
been to overload his stomach and clog his system with so much food. "Why, I never needed that 
much." he said, "although I thought I really did need it. I must admit this diet squad has been a 
regular awakening for me. I have not been hungry between meals. I have had plenty to eat. And 
I have learned to eat things I thought I did not like. I have learned, too, that I have been eating 
too much for my own good for years." 

The secret of it was that he was eating balanced meals. He was getting full value in nourish- 
ment and blood for every particle of food he ate. He worked twelve hours a day, and, although 
his work was heavy manual labor, he had enough to eat at three meals for twenty-five cents. The 
meals were so arranged that things worked together to give him the correct amount of nourish- 
ment. For instance, if we had a main course with small nourishment value, a dessert with a large 
amount of nourishment was served. One night we had a main course with little food value, so we 
had apple-sauce cake, which is high in food value, for dessert. The same thing was done one night 
when we were given a Norwegian prune pudding for dessert, which had twice the food value of the 
main course, which had been creamed codfish. 

While one woman is trying to feed her fat husband another is working hard to know what 
to give her thin one so he will gain flesh. Strange as it may seem, the table of weights on our 
squad showed that eating the proper amount of food, not too much and not too little, automat- 
ically corrects physical faults. The thin man puts on flesh. The fat ones reduce, and the folks 
who weigh up right, according to standard, remain about the same. 

These menus, as scientitically announced by the Life Extension Institute, are not correct for 
growing children, but must be supplemented by large quantities of milk and eggs. 

During the two weeks' experiment we had guests, men prominent in political, educational, 
philanthropic and business life of Philadelphia. They came with a sneer usually, "just to see." 
They went away full of stomach and convinced that science can aid the American housewife to 
solve her problem of "feeding the family." One man, worth much money, told us he usually ate 
enough for three people simply from force of habit. But he said he had never realized this was 
true until he ate with the diet squad. He had just the same luncheon we had. He ate savory rice, 
currant rolls, butter, tea and milk and went away satisfied. 

You may not be able to prepare these menus and recipes at the same prices as the diet squads 
did, for it is impossible nowadays to predict next month's food prices. However, you may be sure 
of one thing: These menus, with an omission here and a substitution there, to fit your individual 
circumstances, will help you to feed your family nourishing, health-giving food at the lowest pos- 
sible prices in these high-cost times. 



FOOD, FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

By Eugene Lyman Fish, M. D. 

Medical Director, Life Extension Institute 

Repriyiled by permission 

THE body needs fuel, just as an engine needs fuel. An engine must have the right kind and 
the right amount of fuel, or it cannot work well. And the human body also must have the 
right kind and amount of food or it cannot work well. The human body is doing some work 
all the time, even in sleep, in sickness and when resting. Heart, muscles and lungs are always 
"on the job." 

An engine has to be built and repaired, to be stoked, to be oiled and regulated. It is the same 
with the human body: We need 

Fuel Food, Building or Repair Food, Regulating Food. 

FEEDING THE HUMAN FURNACE 

SUPPOSE we have all these kinds of food in the pantry and the coal to cook them. Are we safe? 
By no means. We may not serve these foods in the right proportion. For example: too 
much or too little fuel food, too little regulating food, or too much building or repair food. Per- 
haps the food may be eaten in the wrong way or under unfavorable conditions. 

Let us suppose that we have the right kind of food, properly cooked. How are we to get it 
into the human furnace so that we shall get the full value of it without clinkers or without undue 
waste or injury to the engine and the machinery? 

You may say: "Just swallow it." Many do this and suffer injury. They put food into the 
stomach as you would pack a trunk, or fill a pail. Many foods (bread, cereals, cake, potatoes and 
the like) are partly digested in the mouth, and all foods are prepared in the mouth for reception 
into the stomach. Many foods (meat, fish, eggs, chicken, parts of cereals, bread and other foods) 
are partly digested in the stomach and prepared for further digestion in the bowels. From the 
bowels the various classes of foods are conveyed where they are needed for work (fuel), for building 
or repair, and for regulating the blood and organs. Mouth, stomach and bowels must do team 
work if your body is to be properly nourished. 

Therefore: You must chew your food thoroughly until it naturally slides down the gullet. 
Don't count your chews or think of your chews, but "Taste" your food thoroughly. You will be 
surprised at the extra flavor and enjoyment and you will not eat so much. Eating keeps you alive. 
It is worth doing well. 

Be cheerful. Do not worry about your food, or anj'thing else. Bring no grouch to the dinner 
table. Eat regularly, even though not hungry. If not hungry, eat little. As the hour for a meal 
approaches, the thought of food makes the juice in the mouth flow. Your mouth waters. As yoU 
chew your food, and taste it thoroughly, the juice of the stomach flows and good digestion is 
assured. Your stomach stops working when you are angry, worried or unduly excited. A little 
rest before and after meals is good. 

Let mealtime be a time of good cheer. It is no time to discuss troubles. 

Don't unload all the worries of the day at the dinner table. Talk them over when the body 
and mind are rested and digestion has well started, and you will find your way out of trouble much 
more easily. 

The story of diet and good feeding is very simple. Approach it as you would any other simple 
story. Do not think that because it concerns the body it is necessarily mysterious, a complex 
scientific matter that only experts can understand. Read the story of the diet squad and feed 
the family in an understanding way instead of by a hit-or-miss method that a farmer would scorn 
to use in feeding hogs or horses. 

FUEL FOODS 

A WORKER at a desk or at a machine where he does no hard labor requires only about half the 
fuel that is necessary for a very hardworking man, a woodsawyer for example. A farmer 
needs about one-third more fuel than the average desk worker. The average woman taking little 
exercise needs about one-third less fuel than an average man, who has more muscular tissue and is 
more active. Children need a lot of fuel, as they burn it quickly. A girl fourteen to seventeen 
years of age will need as much or more than a full-grown woman and a boy of the same age more 
than a full-grown business man. So people vary in their fuel needs just as different types of auto- 
mobiles vary in the amount of gasoline they need. 

The following list shows the main fuel foods. These are the great foundation foods of the 
diet, the foods that supply energy for muscular work. Mental work requires so little extra fuel 
that it is not necessary to consider it specially. 

There are three main groups of fuel foods. Here they are in order of cost per calory — that 
is, those giving most energy for the money heading the list. 

Starchy Foods Sugars Fats 



Corn meal 


Cornstarch 


Sugar 


Butter 


Drippings 


Hominy 


Dried Lima beans 


Corn sirup 


Cream 


Lard 


Broken rice 


Split peas, yellow 


Dates 




Salt pork 


Oatmeal 


Dried navy beans 


Candy 




Oleomargarine 


Flour 


Bread 


Molasses 




Nutmargarine 


Rice 


Potatoes 


Most fruits 




Peanut butter 


Macaroni 


Bananas 






Milk 


Spaghetti 








Bacon 



About 85 per cent, of the fuel (calories) should come from this group, using starchy foods in 
largest amounts, fats next and sugars least. Fats, starchy foods and sugars are almost pure fuel, 
like coal, while cereal foods also contain some building and regulating material. 

Building and Repair Foods 
The body is continually rebuilding worn parts, and needs several kinds of food for this pur- 
pose. In general, building foods fall into two classes, called "Proteins" and "Mineral Salts." 

Protein Food or "Body Bricks" 
Proteins may be compared to building bricks and are represented in the diet by lean meat of all 
sorts (including fish, shell food and fowl), milk, cheese, eggs, dried peas and beans, lentils and nuts. 
There is also a fair amount of protein in cereals and bread (about 10 per cent,) which are both 
building and fuel foods. Eggs and flesh foods need to be limited in quantity because too much of 
them may make trouble for the human machine, leaving in the body, when burned (digested), 
wastes that may be likened to "clinkers" in the furnace. 

Most foods contain some protein, but those here mentioned are richest in protein, and hence 
are termed building or repair foods. 

Protein foods for building and repair in order of their cost, those giving most building and 
repair v'alue for the money heading the list. 

Beans (dried white) Macaroni 

Dried Peas Mutton, Leg 

Oatmeal Beef, Lean rump 

Cornmeal Milk (9 cents a quart) 

Beans, dried Lima Beef, Lean round 

Bread Lamb, Leg 

Bread, whole-wheat Eggs (24 cents a dozen) 

Bread, Graham Halibut 

Salt cod Porterhouse steak 

Milk, skimmed (6 cents a quart) Eggs (36 cents a dozen) 

Cheese (American) Almonds, shelled 

Peanuts 
The very high protein or repair foods (meat, fish, eggs, and fowl) should be eaten once a day. 
The rest of the repair material needed will be found in sufficient quantity in the balance of the 
diet. Muscular labor, which increases the need for fuel (calories) does not materially increase 
the need for bricks, or proteins. It is a mistake to think that eating meat gives special strength 
for work. Starchy foods, fat and sugar, are the great sources of working force. To burn meat for 
fuel is like burning mahogany or rosewood for kindling wood, or burning wood that is full of bolts 
and nails, or covered with mortar. Mineral Salts 

THE second kind of building material includes a variety of minerals which help to make bones, 
blood and other body parts. They are found chiefly in milk, cereal foods (when made from 
whole grains), fruits and vegetables. Of these minerals, lime, iron and phosphorus are especially 
needed to keep the body in healthy condition. In a diet that daily includes milk, green vege- 
tables, fruit, and cereals made from whole grains (oatmeal, flaked wheat, wheatena, etc.,) there 
is little danger of mineral starvation. Where the diet is v-ery limited, with white flour, fats and 
sugar forming the chief foods, there is such danger. A pint of milk a day is the best insurance 
against lime and phosphorus lack. Cereals, fruits and green vegetables will furnish iron, and may 
be supplemented by eggs (especially yolks) and meat for this purpose. 

Regulating Foods 

(1) Mineral salts. These serve two purposes in the body. They are building foods, as stated 
above, and also help to keep the body macliinery running properly. 

(2) Water. Water is one of the most important of regulating foods. Most people drink too 
little. A glass in the morning on arising, one before each meal, and another on going to bed, or, 
a glass at each meal, and one between meals, are good rules. Water at meals is beneficial except 
for persons who are too fat. They should avoid much water at meals and drink a lot between meals. 

(3) Ballast or bulk — A diet which contains no vegetable fiber is insufficient except for babies. 
This fiber is found in graham or whole wheat bread, leaves and skins of plants and skins of fruit. 
Examples are: Vegetables — Lettuce, parsnips, carrots, turnips, celery, oj'ster plant, cabbage, 
Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, salsify, Spanish onions, spinach. Fruit — Apples (baked or raw), 
pears, currants, raspberries, cranberries, prunes, dates, figs. (Fruit three times daily, but espe- 
cially before bedtime). This ballast or bulk counteracts constipation and gives adequate work 
to teeth, jaws, stomach and bowels. These organs will degenerate if allowed to "loaf." 

(4) Hard foods — The bulky foods just mentioned assist in inducting proper chewing of 
foods, but proper chewing and vigorous use of the teeth and jaws is further secured by including 
in the diet hard foods such as crusts, hard crackers, toast. Zwieback, fibrous vegetables and fruits, 
like celery and nuts. Chewing hard foods means more health and less dentist's bills. 

(5) Accessories or vitamines — There are minute substances (vitamines) present in very small 
quantities in a number of foods and apparently absolutely necessary to health, but not found in 
all kinds of food material. This is one more reason for variety in the diet. Milk, eggs, whole 
wheat, corn, oatmeal, potatoes and oranges are some of the foods known to contain them. The 
skins or hulls of cereals are also good for this reason, and fresh meat, fresh peas and beans. Cook- 
ing reduces the amount of vitamines in most foods. Hence, as a matter of safety, orange juice 
should be given to children when pasteurized milk is the clii-^f food. Adults would do well to eat 
some raw food and fresh fruk daily. 



Summary 

Is it necessary to know how many calories you are getting each day, or how many ounces 
of protein? 

By no means. 

The following rules will make it possible for you to feed yourself and your family without 
weighing your food or counting your calories: 

Weigh yourself twice a month. If you are above the average weight you need less fuel. If 
you are very light in weight and losing weight, you need more fuel. 

Try to have some bulky food, some raw food, some whole cereal, some fruit and some milk 
in your diet each day. 

Eat high protein foods (meat, fish, fowl, eggs) only once a day in moderate amount. Have 
one or two meatless days a week. 

ADVICE FOR SPECIAL TYPES OF PEOPLE 

YOU who are overweight remember that you are carrying a burden that may break down your 
health. You should eat less of fats, starchy foods, and sugars, and you should avoid alcoholic 
drinks. Eat more fruit and vegetables, especially cabbage, lettuce, celery, spinach, string beans, 
cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, turnips and sea kale. Exercise daily. 

You who are pale and thin, and losing weight, eat freely of all the foods in the menus and 
watch your weight and your color. Do deep breathing and setting-up exercises. Try to get more 
fresh fruit, vegetables and egg yolks if possible. 

You who are constipated — Eat freely of whole cereals, bran, lemon juice, and orange juice, 
cabbage, and other bulky vegetables Strictly avoid mineral water, pills, laxatives. Use mineral 
oil if necessary, one or two ounces at night. Exercise, use water between meals freely, and have 
regular times for bowel movements. If such natural methods are not sufficient, consult a doctor. 

You who work at desks — Eat lightly of the starches, fats and sugars, and try to get plenty of 
fruit, green vegetables and milk. 

You who are doing heavy work — Eat freely. Watch your weight. Eat enough to keep your 
weight at the average for age 30. Do not put on great layers of flesh. Fat is not good for a prize- 
fighter; it is not good for you. All men should be "in training" all the time; always "fit"; good 
muscles; no pads of useless, burdensome fat. Cut down on the bread and butter, sugar, puddings, 
and cereals if you find yourself climbing up the scale. Potatoes do not matter. They are 80 per 
cent, water, but valuable food, and you are not likely to eat enough of them to count heavily. 

You who are moderately active, not at hard labor but still moving about and not at a desk 
or machine all the time, eat moderately and include some fresh fruit and green vegetables in 
you diet. 

You who think this is all nonsense — go to the census records, and you will find that one-half 
the people died before 60 years of age, many of them because they did not know how to feed 
their bodies. 

MENUS FROM RECIPES FROM CHICAGO DIET SQUAD* 
Held Under the Auspices of the Chicago Health Department 

THESE menus were served in Chicago, Illinois, during November and December, 1916, and 
at that time cost between thirty and forty cents a day, averaging for the two weeks thirty- 
one cents a day for each person on the squad. The food supplies were purchased in the open 
market at prevailing market prices. The food consumed by the squad cost no less than the 
same articles purchased in the same way by any Chicago housewife.

A FEW RULES FOR MARKETING 

By Lillian A. Kemp 
Director of the School of Domestic Arts and Sciences, Chicago 
(Miss Kemp helped to prepare the menus and marketing orders for the Chicago Diet Squad) 

Watch market quotations and food advertisements daily. 

Go to market and make your own selections, thereby getting better values. 

Buy staples in bulk as far as possible, avoiding canned and packaged goods. 

Make a special effort to limit use of butter and eggs. 

When high prices prevail use butter substitute. 

Purchase fruits and vegetables in season. 

Don't forget that overestimating means additional expense, so watch table refuse; it will 
guide you in both planning and buying. 

REMEMBER WHEN MAKING OUT MENUS 

By Mrs. Lynden Evans 
President of the School of Domestic Arts and Sciences, Chicago 
First: Snapshot menus are always expensive. Menus should be carefully planned for 
several days, bearing in mind: 

What will satisfy the group in variety and flavor. Quantity and cost in buying. 
What will keep the group in health. Wise marketing. 

Do your menu making without discussion. If it is right your family will be satisfied. 
Second: The use of less expensive foods is entirely satisfactory when they are properly 
prepared and served. The cost of living is affected in a large degree by skill or carelessness. Get- 
ting good use of your money is of equal importance with getting the money. Careless buying 
boosts prices. . . . The woman who undertakes the management of a home without knowing 
how is on a par with the man who marries without being able to support a home. 

SOME HOME JOURNAL HELPS 

THE following articles have all appeared in The Ladies' Home Journal, but have such a 
direct bearing on the "Low-Cost Meal" problem that they are here reprinted by special 
permission. Although rapidly changing prices make the figures mentioned in some of these articles 
seem low, the substance is just as applicable now as formerly. 

CUTTING OUT THE ICE BILL 

By Mrs. E. H. Moore 

KEEPING food in hot weather was a troublesome problem until we devised an iceless refrig- 
erator which is satisfactory and costs nothing for upkeep. 

Our water pipes run from the street mains into the cellar at the front and continue exposed 
almost the length of the cellar, being hung in a simple way from the ceiling. We noticed that the 
pipes were always cold and that on warm days the water sometimes dripped from them to the 
floor. This continued coldness in the pipes took the place of ice in the refrigerator. The sketch 
shows how we utilized this. 

The necessary tools were a pipe wrench, a pipe cutter and a vise. The main supply pipe was 
cut to make all the water in the house pass through the coil of the cooler. Provision was made for 
valves, as shown on the sketch, so that the coil might readily be drained and cut off from the 
main supply pipe — to prevent freezing in winter. The coil was constructed so that these cold- 
water pipes were on two sides of the food. 

It might be better to inclose three sides and the top and the 
bottom with these pipes, although we have found the apparatus sat- 
isfactory with only the two sides inclosed. In order to prevent rust- 
ing, galvanized pipes were used. The coil was designed to provide 
a cooling space eighteen inches wide, two feet deep and three feet 
in height— 'a little larger than the average small refrigerator. The 
pipes leading from the supply pipe were so cut that the box, as it 
afterward turned out to be, hung at a convenient height from the 
ceiling. The pipes were a sufficient support. 

The following table shows the material and fittings used for 
the coil: 

Piping — 14 pieces 24 inches long, 14 Pieces 4]/i inches long, all threaded 
on both ends; 2 pieces 12 inches long, 2 pieces 18 inches long. Fittings — 28 
elbows, 3 two-way valves, 2 tees, 1 drip cock. 

For the shelves heavy galvanized sheet iron of double thickness 
was used, and the ends were turned over and hammered flat to provide stiffness. When the coil and 
the shelves were complete a covering that would not only help to keep out the heat but would also 
keep out dust and dirt was provided. Four yards of heavy oilcloth, such as is used for covering 
kitchen tables, did this cheaply and made a cloth box large enough to slip over the coil. Holes were 
cut in the top for the two protruding pipes and in the bottom for the drain cock. A piece of oilcloth, 
cut to fit the front, for the door, was stitched on at the top and a rod ran through a hem in the 
bottom to make it hang straight. In the sketch this oilcloth covering is shown by dotted lines. 
The piping, valves, elbows and galvanized iron for the coil cost $7.50, the oilcloth for the 
cover $1.10, the total cost being a little under $9. There is no expense for ice supply. As for the 
difference in convenience — well, when I think of the continual nuisance of letting in the iceman and 
of cleaning my refrigerator, I am more than thankful.

HOW TO MAKE A FIRELESS COOKER 

TWENTY-FIVE cents is the cost of this fireless cooker. A tin lard pail, which was lined with 
two thicknesses of paper before packing, is used for the outside container of the cooker. A 
gallon oyster can, in which three inches of packing are allowed on all sides and at the bottom, is 
used as the nest. A piece of asbestos is wrapped around the outside of the nest and another piece 
put under the bottom to prevent the scorching of the packing when hot soapstones are used. 
Shredded newspaper and excelsior are packed tightly around and to the top of the nest, which is 
about three inches below the rim of the outside pail. A circular piece of cardboard, made to fit 
inside the lard can, hides the packing and makes a neat finish. Pressure is caused by placing an 
excelsior cushion three inches thick on the top of the inside lid, and hooking down firmly the top 
of the outside container. Last, the two pails are enameled white. 

WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH A FIRELESS COOKER 

By Mrs. J. W . Powell 

WHEN I first used my fireless cooker I was keenly disappointed in the saving of time, labor 
and gas. Then I found it was because I had cooked only one food at a time, whereas, to get 
the best results, several foods should be cooked at the same time. 

Foods cooked in the "fireless" way require about one-third longer for cooking than if placed 
directly over the gas. On this basis I made out a list of foods and the time required for their 
cooking. By using dishes which fit properly into the cooker, two or three foods may be cooked at one 
time. Baking and boiling can easily be done in this manner since the vessel containing the food 
to be boiled can be placed on the top radiator, which is always used for baking or roasting. Cereals 
I cook overnight, often putting them into the cooker just after the dinner is removed, as the stones 
are already partially heated at that time. 

One Hour — Celery soup, round steak with vegetables, bread pudding; baked fish, baked 
potatoes, young beets, steamed pudding (partly cooked on gas); salmon loaf^creamed potatoes, 
spinach; rice and tomato soup, Irish stew, bread pudding; corn soup, veal an* rice, cauliflower. 

Two Hours — Pea soup, fried chicken, sweet potatoes, tapioca custard; meat loaf, tomatoes 
with onions, potatoes, fruit pudding; lamb chops, parsnips, baked apples; pork tenderloins, rice, 
baked squash, apple sauce; boiled salmon, rice, beets, rhubarb. 

Three Hours — Leg of lamb, macaroni, escalloped potatoes; beef stew, string beans, brown 
Betty; veal with spaghetti, baked apples. 

Four Hours — Pea Soup, boiled dinner, rice pudding. 

Six Hours — Chicken stew, dried fruit. 

Seven Hours — Lentil soup, corned beef, stewed figs.

HOW I USE MY DRIPPINGS 

By Jane Shumway 

I NEVER realized how much actual money I was throwing away by failing to use every scrap 
of meat fat, until I weighed that trimmed from an aitch-bone roast. There was a pound. So 
I decided to render or try it out and do some experimenting. 

I first cut it in small pieces; then put it in a pail, barely covered with cold water, and set it 
in a small pan of boiling water on the back of the stove, where it remained for several hours, until 
the fat had slowly melted out and the solid part was crisp and brown. I then added a teaspoonful 
of salt and strained the clear fat into half-pound baking-powder cans, cooled it, then covered it 
and stored it in a cool place, as I would lard or butter. By actual weight I found that the fat had 
lost only two ounces during the process. 

As we are a large family I made several loaves of cake a week, for which I used half a pound 
of butter (eighteen cents) and half a pound of lard (8 cents). At my first baking I substituted half 
a cupful of the rendered beef fat, worked it in with the sugar until creamy, and used it for a large 
loaf. The salt gave a butterlike flavor, and the drippings, because not burned, were absolutely 
tasteless. However, the cake was too rich, because the drippings, unlike most other fats, con- 
tained no water. So I found it more satisfactory to decrease the amount one-sixth in all recipes 
where shortening was demanded. 

FOR making pie crust I used the same amount as of lard, rubbing into the flour half the neces- 
sary quantity, then moistening the dough, rolling it out and adding the balance, creamed, in 
layers as for flaky pastry. In making all quick breads, as corn muffins, etc., I found that a scant 
tablespoonful of melted drippings gave just as good results as the customary melted butter. I 
have always been very proud of my bread, but when I substituted drippings for the mixture of 
butter and lard that I had always used nobody knew the difference. One day, when making 
boiled salad dresiing, I found that there was no butter, so in went the required amount of beef 
drippings and the result was as good as ever. 

I found that rendered fat was an indispensable asset to my housekeeping, so bought three 
pounds of beef fat each week, at eight cents a pound, for shortening. But this was only one phase 
of the fat question; if clear beef fat was good for certain purposes, why did not the drippings from 
the roasting-pan, skimmings from the soup-pot, lamb fat, bacon, sausage and ham fat, have a 
place in my household economy? I began by saving the bacon fat, but found that it was not very 
good for frying purposes, because burned, so I commenced to bake bacon in the oven, laying it on 
a rack in a pan so thai the dripping would not interfere with the cookery. The fat was as clear as 
amber, and I used it for frying eggs, potatoes, corn fritters, eggplant and other vegetables as well 
as for seasoning tomato sauce, macaroni with tomatoes, basting fish and seasoning bread dress- 
ings And later I used sausage and ham fat in a similar way. 

THEN one day when we had baked potatoes for breakfast the butter supply was so low that 
I served melted bacon fat in a pretty bowl instead, and the family liked it better. 

I discovered that the reason my family was so fond of liver and bacon was because of the 
bacon flavor. So, while we could not always afford bacon, by aid of the drippings I was able to 
prepare a delicious meal from liver which I bought for eight cents a pound. 

I had never used dried lentils, peas and beans very much, because they always seemed to 
demand so much salt pork for seasoning. However, I was so successful in the use of other kinds of 
drippings that I began to hoard every scrap of fat. 

My first experiment with dried vegetables and drippings was with Boston baked beans. In 
these I substituted half a cupful of sausage fat for the usual half-pound of salt pork; Lima beans 
I boiled with ham fat and reheated in milk sauce, while dried peas and lentils were made into 
soups, seasoned with either of these three savorj' fats. 

Sausage drippings made an excellent shortening for ginger-bread and ginger cookies, while 
beef drippings from a roast, if not scorched, could be rendered and used for dark cake. 

Any of these fats was excellent for frying purposes, although I made it a rule not to mix the 
savory and bland fats lest the flavor of the smoked meat penetrate my doughnuts or croquettes. 
Beef fat, the skimmings from corned beef, and lamb fat proved excellent for deep-fat frying. How- 
ever, it was necessary to soak the lamb fat for twenty-four hours in cold water before rendering, 
to remove the strong taste. 

I found that my butter bill decreased two-thirds, lard was wiped entirely off my book, and 
my total cooking-fat expenditure each week averaged twenty-four cents for the three pounds 
of beef fat. 

COOKING IN THE OVEN 

WHILE basting some meat the water boiling in the roasting pan gave me an idea: If water 
boils in the oven in one pan it should also boil in another. -To prove the fact I filled a sauce- 
pan with cold water, put it in the oven to heat, and the water boiled. From that day, three months 
ago, I have cooked nearly all my dinners in the oven. I selected pans that would take up as little 
oven space as possible and coveied them with close-fitting galvanized lids — tin ones will rust. 
For roasts I use an oblong or oval, straight-sided pan. 

I prepare the foods as usual and allow the same amount of time for cooking them. I add 
salt to the vegetables, put them in boiling water and cover the pan so the water cannot evaporate 
and fill the oven with steam. When the water on the vegetables boils steadily I lower the gat. 
Foods that require a long time for cooking I put at the back of the oven out of the way. In roast- 
ing meat I sear it, cover it with another pan and lower it to the floor of the oven. 



Sunday I cooked the following menu — all in my oven: 

Roast Chicken, Giblet Sauce 

String Beans Browned Potatoes 

Buttered Beets Muffins 

Baked Apples 

Cup Cakes 

The giblets for the chicken gravy, the string beans, beets and potatoes I boiled on the upper 
shelf. Later I browned the potatoes in the roasting pan. On the lower rack I cooked the apples; 
later I lowered the heat and baked the muffins and cup cakes. The chicken I kept in the roasting 
pan on the floor of the oven. 

The advantages of oven cooking are many. Two burners can be made to do the work of six, 
at an average cost of five cents an hour, and, except when baking bread or cakes, you may leave 
your cooking for nearly an hour at a time, saving energy for other things. 

SIX WAYS OF SERVING SOUP MEAT 

I BUY a ten-cent piece of soup beef and cook it in the fireless cooker. The cooker prevents it 
from breaking up while cooking. 

(1) I sometimes slice the meat cold and serve it with horseradish sauce. 

(2) I grind the meat, chop a few cold boiled potatoes, grate an onion, mix together, and fry 
like hash. 

(3) I grind the meat, boiled potatoes and onion together, mix with an egg, shape into meat 
cakes, and fry. 

(4) I cut the meat into small pieces, add a medium-sized onion, chop fine and mix with the 
following dressing: One tablespoonful of butter, half a tablespoonful each of flour and sugar, one 
teaspoonful of mustard, one egg, half a cupful of vinegar and one cupful of milk. I mix it thor- 
oughly and cook five minutes, and add half a cupful of chopped sweet pickles. 

(5) I make one cupful and a half of white sauce, add a chopped hard-boiled egg, and to this 
add the chopped meat. I prepare a nest of mashed potatoes mixed with grated cheese, brown 
in oven, and fill with the meat mixture. 

(6) I scoop out the centers of six tomatoes, add the chopped meat, half a cupful of mayon- 
naise, two chopped pickles and a hard-boiled egg, refill the tomatoes, and serve on lettuce leaves. 

I WISH WOMEN KNEW HOW TO BUY MEAT AND SAVE THEMSELVES MONEY 

By a Butcher 

OF BEEF there are three grades: good, second-best and poor. Many women ask me if there is 
not as much nourishment in the cheapest grade as in the better grades. There is not, be- 
cause low-priced cattle are fed on brewer's ^grains, cottonseed oil, etc., which fattens them but 
produces soft, flabby flesh. This shrinks to a greater extent in cooking. Besides there is as much 
bone in a thin animal as in a fat one. 

Good beef has firm fat tinged with pink, and the meat is interwoven with threads of fat. 
Poor beef has very yellow fat and the meat is lean and scraggy. 

A side of beef is divided into a forequarter and a hindquarter, the latter containing the loin 
from which the highest-priced steaks and roasts are cut. It is an easy rule to remember that meat 
is expensive in the center of the animal and cheaper at the extremities, chiefly because the latter 
meat is toughened by muscular action. Most people do not like the cheap cuts because they can- 
not cook them tender, and so buy steaks and roasts. Because of this excess demand we have to 
charge a very high price for them. 

Sometimes it seems that most women think a steer is made up entirely of ribs and loins 1 
There is one point, however, that people overlook, and that is, that most of the cheaper cuts have 
little waste, so that, besides costing less a pound, the meat goes almost twice as far. The waste 
from a two-pound sirloin steak averages about three-quarters of a pound. 

Too many of my customers buy unnecessarily in small quantities. When one's means are 
limited it is far better to buy in quantities sufficient for three days at a time. It is not necessary 
to prepare the meat always the same way, for I am glad to cut it for different uses. 

For instance, take a chuck rib of beef; it will weigh, say, fourteen pounds and a half and sells 
today as it falls for eighteen cents a pound, making a total of two dollars and sixty-one cents. 
From it I can cut two pounds and a half of soup meat, three pounds of meat which can be pot- 
roasted, and, after boning the rest, can make a delicious five-pound roast from it, which would 
ordinarily sell at thirty-five cents a pound. That leaves four pounds of bone and fat. 

The bone makes fine soup stock and the fat can be rendered for cooking. If bought sepa- 
rately these cuts would cost two dollars and ninety-five cents — an expenditure on the purchase 
of thirty-four cents above the price of the whole piece. 

Brisket is equally good corned or fresh. Although it contains considerable bone a six-pound 
piece, at eighteen cents, gives three pounds of meat for a pot roast, two pounds and a half of bone 
for stock and half a pound of fat to render. 

Another cut which comes from part of the hind-quarter is flank steak. This may be scored 
and broiled and served with a tomato sauce, or it may be made into a " blind duck." To do this 
it should be stuffed with chopped onions and potatoes well seasoned with salt, pepper and sage, 
tied securely and braised. Or it might be used for beef roulades with vegetables, in a stew, or 
boiled and made into a pie. It is clear meat with no waste when well trimmed, and it sells for 
from eighteen to twenty cents a pound.

Flank fat sells for ten and twelve cents a pound and can be rendered with practically no 
waste, and suet sells for about the same price. It is not economy to buy very cheap beef fat, 
because it contains so much meat liber, that is waste. In fact, it always pays to purchase meats 
that are well trimmed, at a higher price a pound, than to buy cheaper grades that contain a great 
deal of waste. 

A rump weighs about twelve pounds and sells at twenty-three cents. From it can be obtained 
fine pot roasts or corned beef, with soup stock from the bones. The round is divided into tw o parts, 
the top and bottom, which are generally cut up into steaks. Those from the top are best and cost 
from twenty-eight to thirty cents — the bottom ones sell from twenty-five to twenty-eight cents 
at present, and if cut from good beef are tender. 

Out of a thirty-pound round I cut about twenty pounds of steak, the rest going to chopped 
meat and trimmings. When you see chopped beef for sale at a low price you can almost always 
be sure that it contains a high percentage of fat, and sometimes a great deal of water, for it is just 
as easy to " plump" beef as chicken or oysters. Better pay a little more and get honest meat. And 
if the market man will not let her see the meat chopped a woman had better grind her meat 
at home. 

The horseshoe is a small piece of clear meat weighing about two pounds and a half. It sells 
for twenty-two cents and maikes an excellent pot roast or stew. 

The leg weighs about nineteen pounds and a quarter and sells at seventeen cents a pound as 
it falls. It contains about five pounds and a half of meat and fourteen pounds of bone. In this 
case it does not pay to buy the entire piece, as it is much cheaper to purchase the clear meat with 
as much bone as is needed. It makes an excellent shank stew. A shin cut from the forequarter 
may be used in a similar way. The forequarter chuck is not cheap at eighteen cents, as it contains 
so much bone, but it makes good stew or boiled beef. 

The season of the year makes considerable difference in the price of meats. From May to 
October the round and sirloin cuts arc more in demand and therefore cost more. Because of this, 
rib roasts drop in price, as few women cook roasts in summer, preferring steaks. In the autumn 
corned beef jumps in price for the same reason. 

Lamb goes up from March to May, while if spring lamb is late it is clear until July. Then is 
the time for women who have to be economical not to buy lamb, yet those are the very women 
who often do it. 

There are three grades of lamb, as of beef. Good lamb is not very heavy. If the leg joints 
are stiff the lamb is fresh, and the fat should be firm and white. The joints of fresh lamb can be 
easily separated to show the knuckle, while mutton is usually splintered at the joint. 

A lamb is divided into halves, each of which is separated into a forequarter and a hindquarter. 
An eight-pound-and-a-half forequarter at eighteen cents costs a dollar and fifty-three cents if 
purchased as it falls, and contains the rack from which the rib chops are cut. 

From this can be taken two pounds and a half of stew meat, one pound and a quarter of 
breast, four shoulder chops, which would be excellent either broiled or en casserole, and two pounds 
of chops from the rack, worth thirty-two cents a pound. Bought separately this would cost one 
dollar and seventy-five cents, or twenty-two cents more than for the whole piece. 

Besides this, there are enough trimmings for a nice barley stew. If desired the chuck, or 
shoulder, can be bought separately, and boned, rolled and dressed for roasting or braising; the 
chuck and breast can be purchased together, filled with a bread dressing and braised, or the shoul- 
der can be raised off for a casserole, the four chops under the shoulder cut out and the neck and 
bones used for a stew. Even a small family can dispose of a shoulder of lamb in this way if the 
woman is willing to cook a little. 

The whole hindquarter weighs about eight pounds and a quarter and sells for twenty-three 
cents, a total of a dollar and ninety cents. From it can be cut eight loin or kidney chops, which 
ordinarily sell for thirty-two cents a pound, and a six-pound roast, which would sell at twenty-five 
cents, and there is a small lamb kidney besides some trimmings. If purchased separately these 
cuts would cost two dollars and seventeen cents. The housewife saves a little more than ten per 
cent., and she will go a long way to save that on dry goods. 

Veal is divided like lamb and is becoming the most expensive of all meats. The shoulder and 
breast sell for about twenty-two cents a pound, and may be stuffed with a bread or a potato-and- 
onion dressing. 

The neck is used for stewing and the rump for pot-roasting or braising. The leg is worth 
about twenty-six cents a pound and weighs eleven pounds. It contains about right pounds of 
solid meat and three of bone, and costs, entire, a dollar and sixty-eight cents. From it is cut the 
fillet, which is sold for roasting at thirty-eight cents a pound, or is cut up into cutlets at forty cents 
a pound. 

The balance is used for stew or casserole. If purchased separately this amount of meat would 
cost two dollars and sixty-four cents, and any large family could dispose of the whole piece; but, 
as few wish to buy the knuckle, or end of the leg, it is necessary to charge a high price for the 
cutlets to make a small profit. 

As to pork, I think it strange that more shoulder pork chops are not purchased, as they 
average four cents less a pound than those in the loin and have no more waste. 

A loin of pork for roasting averages two cents a pound less than when cut up into chops, and 
contains only a third of bone waste. On the other hand, a fresh shoulder of ham, if well cut, is a 
cheaper roast and may be boned and stuffed to good advantage, while a fresh ham contains little 
waste and is as good eating as turkey; in fact, it is often preferred to turkey.

Low Cost Meals for High Cost Times 

MENUS FROM THE NEW YORK DIET SQUAD 

Held Under the Auspices of the Life Extension Institute, New York City 

THESE menus were served in New York City during January, 1917, and cost at that time 
approximately twenty-five cents a person per day for the three meals. The menus were planned 
for twelve young men who were in active training in the New York City police department. These 
men pledged themselves to eat nothing while on the squad except the food provided at mealtime 
by the Life Extension Institute, of which Eugene Lyman Fish, M. D., is medical director, and 
under whose direction the diet experiment was made. The average age of the men was 26. The 
average weight at the start of the experiment was 169 pounds; at the close it was 172 pounds. 

The menus form a wholesome diet for the average active individual, although as they stand 
they are not suitable for all classes of people. For sedentary people they should be modified and 
taken in small quantities. This can be done either by spending less money on the food or by 
decreasing the amount of fuel food — starches, sugars and fats — and including more fruit and green 
vegetables. 

More eggs and milk are needed for children and, if possible, more fruit and green vegetables; 
the fuel food for children, however, must not be reduced. Tea and coffee were included as conces- 
sions to the former habits of those who volunteered to take the diet experiment, but these are not 
recommended for a regular diet.

A GUIDE IN FEEDING CHILDREN 

A LITTLE child who is carefully fed in accordance with his bodily needs, as these are now 
understood, receives every day at least one food from each of the following groups: 

(1) Milk and dishes made chiefly of milk, most important of the groups as regards children's 
diet; meat, fish, poultry, eggs and meat substitutes. 

(2) Bread and other cereal foods. 

(3) Butter and other wholesome fats. 

(4) Vegetables and fruits. 

(5) Simple sweets. 

A simple rule is to make a quart of milk the basis of a child's daily food, no matter whether 
the child's age is two or ten. This does not mean that the child must drink it all; it may be 
served in puddings, custards, soups, junket, or with cereals. This, with a well-cooked cereal, an 
egg, fruit or fruit juice and a fresh green vegetable and crusty bread, gives a child the necessary 
food for his daily growth and activity. 



MY EXPERIENCES ON THE PHILADELPHIA DIET SQUAD 

By Lisella Neukom 

NOTE — The menus served to the Philadelphia diet squad were identical with those served to the 
*' Rookies" in the New York experiment. Both diet squads were held under the direction of the Life Extension 
Institute. 

FIRST let me assure you that we all had enough to eat. We were not hungry between meals, 
and none of us ate a thing except what was served us at the squad table. All of us were in 
better physical condition when we stopped than when we began. When we went on the diet 
squad we just ate balanced, sane meals — meals any normal person could relish. They were meals 
to give any ordinary adult proper nourishment and keep him in good physical condition. We had 
fish, meat, pies, cake, fruits, puddings, pan cakes — in fact, all sorts of things; so you see we were 
not on a diet as sick people are put on a diet, which is the first thing most people think of when 
you say "diet" to them. 

The Philadelphia diet squad was held in the middle of a cold Eastern winter. Fresh vegetables 
were expensive; eggs were dear; butter was costly. Still we had plenty of good, wholesome 
food — three meals for twenty-five cents — because science came to the rescue. In spite of the high 
prices of certain things, the dietitian obtained food which gave us as much nourishment at much 
less cost than higher-priced foods. In order to take this message of economy to women throughout 
the nation, to show them that even in these war times they can reduce their food bills materially 
and improve their health proportionately, the Life Extension Institute plans*to hold diet squads 
in every nook and corner of the country. 

The Philadelphia squad was made up of social-service workers and myself, a reporter from 
the Philadelphia Evening Ledger. We all went about our regular duties. Some of us gained in 
flesh, some of us lost, but all showed improved blood pressure, intestinal activity and general 
physical condition. No one on our squad missed a meal or was ill a day during the two weeks. 
The dietitian took the weights, kind of work the " squadders" did, the number of hours they spent 
at work and the amount of sleep they took, and then computed, according to science, how much 
food we should have, just as an engineer figures out how much coal his engine needs. It was 
seldom that we needed to go over the amount allotted, although we had the privilege of doing so 
whenever we wished. 

"Well, that may be all right," you say, " but suppose you have a big, fat husband. He would 
starve on 'diet squad' fare, wouldn't he?" 

On the Philadelphia diet squad we had a man who weighed nearly two hundred pounds — an ex- 
prize fighter ; and his appetite was anything but small ! He had been in the habit — for he admitted 
it was only a habit after all — of " consuming" a steak, or a huge serving of meat stew, several pota- 
toes, side dishes of vegetables and a dessert, to say nothing of large quantities of bread and butter — 
all at one meal. 

And this man told me, after eating on the squad, that he had never realized how futile it had 
been to overload his stomach and clog his system with so much food. "Why, I never needed that 
much." he said, "although I thought I really did need it. I must admit this diet squad has been a 
regular awakening for me. I have not been hungry between meals. I have had plenty to eat. And 
I have learned to eat things I thought I did not like. I have learned, too, that I have been eating 
too much for my own good for years." 

The secret of it was that he was eating balanced meals. He was getting full value in nourish- 
ment and blood for every particle of food he ate. He worked twelve hours a day, and, although 
his work was heavy manual labor, he had enough to eat at three meals for twenty-five cents. The 
meals were so arranged that things worked together to give him the correct amount of nourish- 
ment. For instance, if we had a main course with small nourishment value, a dessert with a large 
amount of nourishment was served. One night we had a main course with little food value, so we 
had apple-sauce cake, which is high in food value, for dessert. The same thing was done one night 
when we were given a Norwegian prune pudding for dessert, which had twice the food value of the 
main course, which had been creamed codfish. 

While one woman is trying to feed her fat husband another is working hard to know what 
to give her thin one so he will gain flesh. Strange as it may seem, the table of weights on our 
squad showed that eating the proper amount of food, not too much and not too little, automat- 
ically corrects physical faults. The thin man puts on flesh. The fat ones reduce, and the folks 
who weigh up right, according to standard, remain about the same. 

These menus, as scientifically announced by the Life Extension Institute, are not correct for 
growing children, but must be supplemented by large quantities of milk and eggs. 

During the two weeks' experiment we had guests, men prominent in political, educational, 
philanthropic and business life of Philadelphia. They came with a sneer usually, "just to see." 
They went away full of stomach and convinced that science can aid the American housewife to 
solve her problem of "feeding the family." One man, worth much money, told us he usually ate 
enough for three people simply from force of habit. But he said he had never realized this was 
true until he ate with the diet squad. He had just the same luncheon we had. He ate savory rice, 
currant rolls, butter, tea and milk and went away satisfied. 

You may not be able to prepare these menus and recipes at the same prices as the diet squads 
did, for it is impossible nowadays to predict next month's food prices. However, you may be sure 
of one thing: These menus, with an omission here and a substitution there, to fit your individual 
circumstances, will help you to feed your family nourishing, health-giving food at the lowest pos- 
sible prices in these high-cost times. 



FOOD, FUEL FOR THE HUMAN ENGINE 

By Eugene Lyman Fish, M. D. 

Medical Director, Life Extension Institute 

Reprinted by permission 

THE body needs fuel, just as an engine needs fuel. An engine must have the right kind and 
the right amount of fuel, or it cannot work well. And the human body also must have the 
right kind and amount of food or it cannot work well. The human body is doing some work 
all the time, even in sleep, in sickness and when resting. Heart, muscles and lungs are always 
"on the job." 

An engine has to be built and repaired, to be stoked, to be oiled and regulated. It is the same 
with the human body: We need 

Fuel Food, Building or Repair Food, Regulating Food. 



FEEDING THE HUMAN FURNACE 

SUPPOSE we have all these kinds of food in the pantry and the coal to cook them. Are we safe? 
By no means. We may not serve these foods in the right proportion. For example: too 
much or too little fuel food, too little regulating food, or too much building or repair food. Per- 
haps the food may be eaten in the wrong way or under unfavorable conditions. 

Let us suppose that we have the right kind of food, properly cooked. How are we to get it 
into the human furnace so that we shall get the full value of it without clinkers or without undue 
waste or injury to the engine and the machinery? 

You may say: "Just swallow it." Many do this and suffer injury. They put food into the 
stomach as you would pack a trunk, or fill a pail. Many foods (bread, cereals, cake, potatoes and 
the like) are partly digested in the mouth, and all foods are prepared in the mouth for reception 
into the stomach. Many foods (meat, fish, eggs, chicken, parts of cereals, bread and other foods) 
are partly digested in the stomach and prepared for further digestion in the bowels. From the 
bowels the various classes of foods are conveyed where they are needed for work (fuel), for building 
or repair, and for regulating the blood and organs. Mouth, stomach and bowels must do team 
work if your body is to be properly nourished. 

Therefore: You must chew your food thoroughly until it naturally slides down the gullet. 
Don't count your chews or think of your chews, but "Taste" your food thoroughly. You will be 
surprised at the extra flavor and enjoyment and you will not eat so much. Eating keeps you alive. 
It is worth doing well. 

Be cheerful. Do not worry about your food, or anything else. Bring no grouch to the dinner 
table. Eat regularly, even though not hungry. If not hungry, eat little. As the hour for a meal 
approaches, the thought of food makes the juice in the mouth flow. Your mouth waters. As you 
chew your food, and taste it thoroughly, the juice of the stomach flows and good digestion is 
assured. Your stomach stops working when you are angry, worried or unduly excited. A little 
rest before and after meals is good. 

Let mealtime be a time of good cheer. It is no time to discuss troubles. 

Don't unload all the worries of the day at the dinner table. Talk them over when the body 
and mind are rested and digestion has well started, and you will find your way out of trouble much 
more easily. 

The story of diet and good feeding is very simple. Approach it as you would any other simple 
story. Do not think that because it concerns the body it is necessarily mysterious, a complex 
scientific matter that only experts can understand. Read the story of the diet squad and feed 
the family in an understanding way instead of by a hit-or-miss method that a farmer would scorn 
to use in feeding hogs or horses. 

FUEL FOODS 

A WORKER at a desk or at a machine where he does no hard labor requires only about half the 
fuel that is necessary for a very hardworking man, a woodsawyer for example. A farmer 
needs about one-third more fuel than the average desk worker. The average woman taking little 
exercise needs about one-third less fuel than an average man, who has more muscular tissue and is 
more active. Children need a lot of fuel, as they burn it quickly. A girl fourteen to seventeen 
years of age will need as much or more than a full-grown woman and a boy of the same age more 
than a full-grown business man. So people vary in their fuel needs just as different types of auto- 
mobiles vary in the amount of gasoline they need. 

The following list shows the main fuel foods. These are the great foundation foods of the 
diet, the foods that supply energy for muscular work. Mental work requires so little extra fuel 
that it is not necessary to consider it specially. 

There are three main groups of fuel foods. Here they are in order of cost per calory— that 
is, those giving most energy for the money heading the list. 



Starchy Foods 


Sugars 


F^ 


TS 


Corn meal 


Cornstarch 


Sugar 


Butter 


Drippings 


Hominy 


Dried Lima beans 


Corn sirup 


Cream 


Lard 


Broken rice 


Split peas, yellow 


Dates 




Salt pork 


Oatmeal 


Dried navy beans 


Candy 




Oleomargarine 


Flour 


Bread 


Molasses 




N utmargarine 


Rice 


Potatoes 


Most fruits 




Peanut butter 


Macaroni 


Bananas 






Milk 


Spaghetti 








Bacon 



About 85 per cent, of the fuel (calories) should come from this group, using starchy foods in 
largest amounts, fats next and sugars least. Fats, starchy foods and sugars are almost pure fuel, 
like coal, while cereal foods also contain some building and regulating material. 
Building and Repair Foods 

The body is continually rebuilding worn parts, and needs several kinds of food for this pur- 
pose. In general, building foods fall into two classes, called "Proteins" and "Mineral Salts." 

Protein Food or "Body Bricks" 
Proteins may be compared to building bricks and are represented in the diet by lean meat of all 
sorts (including fish, shell food and fowl), milk, cheese, eggs, dried peas and beans, lentils and nuts. 
There is also a fair amount of protein in cereals and bread (about 10 per cent,) which are both 
building and fuel foods. Eggs and flesh foods need to be limited in quantity because too much of 
them may make trouble for the human machine, leaving in the body, when burned (digested), 
wastes that may be likened to "clinkers" in the furnace. 

Most foods contain some protein, but those here mentioned are richest in protein, and hence 
are termed building or repair foods. 

Protein foods for building and repair in order of their cost, those giving most building and 
repair value for the money heading the list. 

Beans (dried white) Macaroni 

Dried Peas Mutton, Leg 

Oatmeal Beef, Lean rump 

Cornmeal Milk (9 cents a quart) 

Beans, dried Lima Beef, Lean round 

Bread Lamb, Leg 

Bread, whole-wheat Eggs (24 cents a dozen) 

Bread, Graham Halibut 

Salt cod Porterhouse steak 

Milk, skimmed (6 cents a quart) Eggs (36 cents a dozen) 

Cheese (American) Almonds, shelled 

Peanuts 
The very high protein or repair foods (meat, fish, eggs, and fowl) should be eaten once a day. 
The rest of the repair material needed will be found in sufficient quantity in the balance of the 
diet. Muscular labor, which increases the need for fuel (calories) does not materially increase 
the need for bricks, or proteins. It is a mistake to think that eating meat gives special strength 
for work. Starchy foods, fat and sugar, are the great sources of working force. To burn meat for 
fuel is like burning mahogany or rosewood for kindling wood, or burning wood that is full of bolts 
and nails, or covered with mortar. MlNERAL Salts 

THE second kind of building material includes a variety of minerals which help to make bones, 
blood and other body parts. They are found chiefly in milk, cereal foods (when made from 
whole grains), fruits and vegetables. Of these minerals, lime, iron and phosphorus are especially 
needed to keep the body in healthy condition. In a diet that daily includes milk, green vege- 
tables, fruit, and cereals made from whole grains (oatmeal, flaked wheat, wheatena, etc.,) there 
is little danger of mineral starvation. Where the diet is very limited, with white flour, fats and 
sugar forming the chief foods, there is such danger. A pint of milk a day is the best insurance 
against lime and phosphorus lack. Cereals, fruits and green vegetables will furnish iron, and may 
be supplemented by eggs (especially yolks) and meat for this purpose. 

Regulating Foods 

(1) Mineral salts. These serve two purposes in the body. They are building foods, as stated 
above, and also help to keep the body machinery running properly. 

(2) Water. Water is one of the most important of regulating foods. Most people drink too 
little. A glass in the morning on arising, one before each meal, and another on going to bed, or, 
a glass at each meal, and one between meals, are good rules. Water at meals is beneficial except 
for persons who are too fat. They should avoid much water at meals and drink a lot between meals. 

(3) Ballast or bulk — A diet which contains no vegetable fiber is insufficient except for babies. 
This fiber is found in graham or whole wheat bread, leaves and skins of plants and skins of fruit. 
Examples are: Vegetables — Lettuce, parsnips, carrots, turnips, celery, oyster plant, cabbage, 
Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, salsify, Spanish onions, spinach. Fruit — Apples (baked or raw), 
pears, currants, raspberries, cranberries, prunes, dates, figs. (Fruit three times daily, but espe- 
cially before bedtime). This ballast or bulk counteracts constipation and gives adequate work 
to teeth, jaws, stomach and bowels. These organs will degenerate if allowed to "loaf." 

(4) Hard foods — The bulky foods just mentioned assist in inducting proper chewing of 
foods, but proper chewing and vigorous use of the teeth and jaws is further secured by including 
in the diet hard foods such as crusts, hard crackers, toast, Zwieback, fibrous vegetables and fruits, 
like celery and nuts. Chewing hard foods means more health and less dentist's bills. 

(5) Accessories or vitamines — There are minute substances (vitamines) present in very small 
quantities in a number of foods and apparently absolutely necessary to health, but not found in 
all kinds of food material. This is one more reason for variety in the diet. Milk, eggs, whole 
wheat, corn, oatmeal, potatoes and oranges are some of the foods known to contain them. The 
skins or hulls of cereals are also good for this reason, and fresh meat, fresh peas and beans. Cook- 
ing reduces the amount of vitamines in most foods. Hence, as a matter of safety, orange juice 
should be given to children when pasteurized milk is the chi-?f food. Adults would do well to eat 
some raw food and fresh fruit daily. 



Summary 

Is it necessary to know how many calories you are getting each day, or how many ounces 
of protein? 

By no means. 

The following rules will make it possible for you to feed yourself and your family without 
weighing your food or counting your calories: 

Weigh yourself twice a month. If you are above the average weight you need less fuel. If 
you are very light in weight and losing weight, you need more fuel. 

Try to have some bulky food, some raw food, some whole cereal, some fruit and some milk 
in your diet each day. 

Eat high protein foods (meat, fish, fowl, eggs) only once a day in moderate amount. Have 
one or two meatless days a week. 

ADVICE FOR SPECIAL TYPES OF PEOPLE 

YOU who are overweight remember that you are carrying a burden that may break down your 
health. You should eat less of fats, starchy foods, and sugars, and you should avoid alcoholic 
drinks. Eat more fruit and vegetables, especially cabbage, lettuce, celery, spinach, string beans, 
cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, turnips and sea kale. Exercise daily. 

You who are pale and thin, and losing weight, eat freely of all the foods in the menus and 
watch your weight and your color. Do deep breathing and setting-up exercises. Try to get more 
fresh fruit, vegetables and egg yolks if possible. 

You who are constipated— Eat freely of whole cereals, bran, lemon juice, and orange juice, 
cabbage, and other bulky vegetables Strictly avoid mineral water, pills, laxatives. Use mineral 
oil if necessary, one or two ounces at night. Exercise, use water between meals freely, and have 
regular times for bowel movements. If such natural methods are not sufficient, consult a doctor. 

You who work at desks— Eat lightly of the starches, fats and sugars, and try to get plenty of 
fruit, green vegetables and milk. 

You who are doing heavy work— Eat freely. Watch your weight. Eat enough to keep your 
weight at the average for age 30. Do not put on great layers of flesh. Fat is not good for a prize- 
fighter; it is not good for you. All men should be "in training" all the time; always "fit"; good 
muscles; no pads of useless, burdensome fat. Cut down on the bread and butter, sugar, puddings, 
and cereals if you find yourself climbing up the scale. Potatoes do not matter. They are 80 per 
cent, water, but valuable food, and you are not likely to eat enough of them to count heavily. 

You who are moderately active, not at hard labor but still moving about and not at a desk 
or machine all the time, eat moderately and include some fresh fruit and green vegetables in 
you diet. 

You who think this is all nonsense — go to the census records, and you will find that one-half 
the people died before 60 years of age, many of them because they did not know how to feed 
their bodies. 

MENUS FROM RECIPES FROM CHICAGO DIET SQUAD* 
Held Under the Auspices of the Chicago Health Department 

THESE menus were served in Chicago, Illinois, during November and December, 1916, and 
at that time cost between thirty and forty cents a day, averaging for the two weeks thirty- 
one cents a day for each person on the squad. The food supplies were purchased in the open 
market at prevailing market prices. The food consumed by the squad cost no less than the 
same articles purchased in the same way by any Chicago housewife.

A FEW RULES FOR MARKETING 

By Lillian A. Kemp 
Director of the School of Domestic Arts and Sciences, Chicago 
(Miss Kemp helped to prepare the menus and marketing orders for the Chicago Diet Squad) 
Watch market quotations and food advertisements daily. 
Go to market and make your own selections, thereby getting better values. 
Buy staples in bulk as far as possible, avoiding canned and packaged goods. 
Make a special effort to limit use of butter and eggs. 
When high prices prevail use butter substitute. 
Purchase fruits and vegetables in season. 

Don't forget that overestimating means additional expense, so watch table refuse; it will 
guide you in both planning and buying. 

REMEMBER WHEN MAKING OUT MENUS 
By Mrs. Lynden Evans 
President of the School of Domestic Arts and Sciences, Chicago 
First: Snapshot menus are always expensive. Menus should be carefully planned for 
several days, bearing in mind: 

What will satisfy the group in variety and flavor. Quantity and cost in buying. 
What will keep the group in health. Wise marketing. 

Do your menu making without discussion. If it is right your family will be satisfied. 
Second: The use of less expensive foods is entirely satisfactory when they are properly 
prepared and served. The cost of living is affected in a large degree by skill or carelessness. Get- 
ting good use of your money is of equal importance with getting the money. Careless buying 
boosts prices. . . . The woman who undertakes the management of a home without knowing 
how is on a.par with the man who marries without being able to support a home. 

SOME HOME JOURNAL HELPS 

THE following articles have all appeared in The Ladies' Home Journal, but have such a 
direct bearing on the "Low-Cost Meal" problem that they are here reprinted by special 
permission. Although rapidly changing prices make the figures mentioned in some of these articles 
seem low, the substance is just as applicable now as formerly. 

CUTTING OUT THE ICE BILL 

By Mrs. E. H. Moore 

KEEPING food in hot weather was a troublesome problem until we devised an iceless refrig- 
erator which is satisfactory and costs nothing for upkeep. 

Our water pipes run from the street mains into the cellar at the front and continue exposed 
almost the length of the cellar, being hung in a simple way from the ceiling. We noticed that the 
pipes were always cold and that on warm days the water sometimes dripped from them to the 
floor. This continued coldness in the pipes took the place of ice in the refrigerator. The sketch 
shows how we utilized this. 

The necessary tools were a pipe wrench, a pipe cutter and a vise. The main supply pipe was 
cut to make all the water in the house pass through the coil of the cooler. Provision was made for 
valves, as shown on the sketch, so that the coil might readily be drained and cut off from the 
main supply pipe— to prevent freezing in winter. The coil was constructed so that these cold- 
water pipes were on two sides of the food. 

It might be better to inclose three sides and the top and the 

g bottom with these pipes, although we have found the apparatus sat- 

I main sui-ply pipe T^^Z Y~ isfactory with only the two sides inclosed. In order to prevent rust- 

ttfl*' ~»Qte} mgj g a i van i ze d pipes were used. The coil was designed to provide 

a cooling space eighteen inches wide, two feet deep and three feet 

in height — a little larger than the average small refrigerator. The 

pipes leading from the supply pipe were so cut that the box, as it 

afterward turned out to be, hung at a convenient height from the 

ceiling. The pipes were a sufficient support. 

The following table shows the material and fittings used for 
the coil: 

Piping — 14 pieces 24 inches long, 14 Pieces 4V£ inches long, all threaded 
on both ends; 2 pieces 12 inches long, 2 pieces 18 inches long. Fittings — 28 
s^vicwoicoa f.om view ol Bo, elbows, 3 two-way valves, 2 tees, 1 drip cock. 

For the shelves heavy galvanized sheet iron of double thickness 
was used, and the ends were turned over and hammered flat to provide stiffness. When the coil and 
the shelves were complete a covering that would not only help to keep out the heat but would also 
keep out dust and dirt was provided. Four yards of heavy oilcloth, such as is used for covering 
kitchen tables, did this cheaply and made a cloth box large enough to slip over the coil. Holes were 
cut in the top for the two protruding pipes and in the bottom for the drain cock. A piece of oilcloth, 
cut to fit the front, for the door, was stitched on at the top and a rod ran through a hem in the 
bottom to make it hang straight. In the sketch this oilcloth covering is shown by dotted lines. 
The piping, valves, elbows and galvanized iron for the coil cost $7.50, the oilcloth for the 
cover $1.10, the' total cost being a little under $9. There is no expense for ice supply. As for the 
difference in convenience— well, when I think of the continual nuisance of letting in the iceman and 
of cleaning my refrigerator, I am more than thankful.

HOW TO MAKE A FIRELESS COOKER 

TWENTY-FIVE cents is the cost of this fireless cooker. A tin lard pail, which was lined with 
two thicknesses of paper before packing, is used for the outside container of the cooker. A 
gallon oyster can, in which three inches of packing are allowed on all sides and at the bottom, is 
used as the nest. A piece of asbestos is wrapped around the outside of the nest and another piece 
put under the bottom to prevent the scorching of the packing when hot soapstones are used. 
Shredded newspaper and excelsior are packed tightly around and to the top of the nest, which is 
about three inches below the rim of the outside pail. A circular piece of cardboard, made to fit 
inside the lard can, hides the packing and makes a neat finish. Pressure is caused by placing an 
excelsior cushion three inches thick on the top of the inside lid, and hooking down firmly the top 
of the outside container. Last, the two pails are enameled white. 

WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH A FIRELESS COOKER 

By Mrs. J. W. Powell 

WHEN I first used my fireless cooker I was keenly disappointed in the saving of time, labor 
and gas. Then I found it was because I had cooked only one food at a time, whereas, to get 
the best results, several foods should be cooked at the same time. 

Foods cooked in the "fireless" way require about one-third longer for cooking than if placed 
directly over the gas. On this basis I made out a list of foods and the time required for their 
cooking. By using dishes which fit properly into the cooker, two or three foods may be cooked at one 
time. Baking and boiling can easily be done in this manner since the vessel containing the food 
to be boiled can be placed on the top radiator, which is always used for baking or roasting. Cereals 
I cook overnight, often putting them into the cooker just after the dinner is removed, as the stones 
are already partially heated at that time. 

One Hour — Celery soup, round steak with vegetables, bread pudding; baked fish, baked 
potatoes, young beets, steamed pudding (partly cooked on gas); salmon loaf, creamed potatoes, 
spinach; rice and tomato soup, Irish stew, bread pudding; corn soup, veal and rice, cauliflower. 

Two Hours — Pea soup, fried chicken, sweet potatoes, tapioca custard; meat loaf, tomatoes 
with onions, potatoes, fruit pudding; lamb chops, parsnips, baked apples; pork tenderloins, rice, 
baked squash, apple sauce; boiled salmon, rice, beets, rhubarb. 

Three Hours — Leg of lamb, macaroni, escalloped potatoes; beef stew, string beans, brown 
Betty; veal with spaghetti, baked apples. 

Four Hours — Pea Soup, boiled dinner, rice pudding. 

Six Hours — Chicken stew, dried fruit. 

Seven Hours — Lentil soup, corned beef, stewed figs.

HOW I USE MY DRIPPINGS 

By Jane Shurnway 

I NEVER realized how much actual money I was throwing away by failing to use every scrap 
of meat fat, until I weighed that trimmed from an aitch-bone roast. There was a pound. So 
I decided to render or try it out and do some experimenting. 

I first cut it in small pieces; then put it in a pail, barely covered with cold water, and set it 
in a small pan of boiling water on the back of the stove, where it remained for several hours, until 
the fat had slowly melted out and the solid part was crisp and brown. I then added a teaspoonful 
of salt and strained the clear fat into half-pound baking-powder cans, cooled it, then covered it 
and stored it in a cool place, as I would lard or butter. By actual weight I found that the fat had 
lost only two ounces during the process. 

As we are a large family I made several loaves of cake a week, for which I used half a pound 
of butter (eighteen cents) and half a pound of lard (8 cents). At my first baking I substituted half 
a cupful of the rendered beef fat, worked it in with the sugar until creamy, and used it for a large 
loaf. The salt gave a butterlike flavor, and the drippings, because not burned, were absolutely 
tasteless. However, the cake was too rich, because the drippings, unlike most other fats, con- 
tained no water. So I found it more satisfactory to decrease the amount one-sixth in all recipes 
where shortening was demanded. 

FOR making pie crust I used the same amount as of lard, rubbing into the flour half the neces- 
sary quantity, then moistening the dough, rolling it out and adding the balance, creamed, in 
layers as for flaky pastry. In making all quick breads, as corn muffins, etc., I found that a scant 
tablespoonful of melted drippings gave just as good results as the customary melted butter. I 
have always been very proud of my bread, but when I substituted drippings for the mixture of 
butter and lard that I had always used nobody knew the difference. One day, when making 
boiled salad dressing, I found that there was 'no butter, so in went the required amount of beef 
drippings and the result was as good as ever. 

I found that rendered fat was an indispensable asset to my housekeeping, so bought three 
pounds of beef fat each week, at eight cents a pound, for shortening. But this was only one phase 
of the fat question; if clear beef fat was good for certain purposes, why did not the drippings from 
the roasting-pan, skimmings from the soup-pot, lamb fat, bacon, sausage and ham fat, have a 
place in my household economy? I began by saving the bacon fat, but found that it was not very 
good for frying purposes, because burned, so I commenced to bake bacon in the oven, laying it on 
a rack in a pan so that the dripping would not interfere with the cookery. The fat was as clear as 
amber, and I used it for frying eggs, potatoes, corn fritters, eggplant and other vegetables as well 
as for seasoning tomato sauce, macaroni with tomatoes, basting fish and seasoning bread dress- 
ings And later I used sausage and ham fat in a similar way. 

THEN one day when we had baked potatoes for breakfast the butter supply was so low that 
I served melted bacon fat in a pretty bowl instead, and the family liked it better. 

I discovered that the reason my family was so fond of liver and bacon was because of the 
bacon flavor. So, while we could not always afford bacon, by aid of the drippings I was able to 
prepare a delicious meal from liver which I bought for eight cents a pound. • 

I had never used dried lentils, peas and beans very much, because they always seemed to 
demand so much salt pork for seasoning. However, I was so successful in the use of other kinds of 
drippings that I began to hoard every scrap of fat. 

My first experiment with dried vegetables and drippings was with Boston baked beans. In 
these I substituted half a cupful of sausage fat for the usual half-pound of salt pork; Lima beans 
I boiled with ham fat and reheated in milk sauce, while dried peas and lentils were made into 
soups, seasoned with either of these three savory fats. 

Sausage drippings made an excellent shortening for ginger-bread and ginger cookies, while 
beef drippings from a roast, if not scorched, could be rendered and used for dark cake. 

Any of these fats was excellent for frying purposes, although I made it a rule not to mix the 
savory and bland fats lest the flavor of the smoked meat penetrate my doughnuts or croquettes. 
Beef fat, the skimmings from corned beef, and lamb fat proved excellent for deep-fat frying. How- 
ever, it was necessary to soak the lamb fat for twenty-four hours in cold water before rendering, 
to remove the strong taste. 

I found that my butter bill decreased two-thirds, lard was wiped entirely off my book, and 
my total cooking-fat expenditure each week averaged twenty-four cents for the three pounds 
of beef fat. 

COOKING IN THE OVEN 

WHILE basting some meat the water boiling in the roasting pan gave me an idea: If water 
boils in the oven in one pan it should also boil in another. -To prove the fact I filled a sauce- 
pan with cold water, put it in the oven to heat, and the water boiled. From that day, three months 
ago, I have cooked nearly all my dinners in the oven. I selected pans that would take up as little 
oven space as possible and covered them with close-fitting galvanized lids — tin ones will rust. 
For roasts I use an oblong or oval, straight-sided pan. 

I prepare the foods as usual and allow the same amount of time for cooking them. I add 
salt to the vegetables, put them in boiling water and cover the pan so the water cannot evaporate 
and fill the oven with steam. When the water on the vegetables boils steadily I lower the ga£. 
Foods that require a long time for cooking I put at the back of the oven out of the way. In roast- 
ing meat I sear it, cover it with another pan and lower it to the floor of the oven. 



Sunday I cooked the following menu — all in my oven: 

Roast Chicken, Giblet Sauce 

String Beans Browned Potatoes 

Buttered Beets Muffins 

Baked Apples 

Cup Cakes 

The giblets for the chicken gravy, the string beans, beets and potatoes I boiled on the upper 
shelf. Later I browned the potatoes in the roasting pan. On the lower rack I cooked the apples; 
later I lowered the heat and baked the muffins and cup cakes. The chicken I kept in the roasting 
pan on the floor of the oven. 

The advantages of oven cooking are many. Two burners can be made to do the work of six, 
at an average cost of five cents an hour, and, except when baking bread or cakes, you may leave 
your cooking for nearly an hour at a time, saving energy for other things. 



SIX WAYS OF SERVING SOUP MEAT 

I BUY a ten-cent piece of soup beef and cook it in the tireless cooker. The cooker prevents it 
from breaking up while cooking. 

(1) I sometimes slice the meat cold and serve it with horseradish sauce. 

(2) I grind the meat, chop a few cold boiled potatoes, grate an onion, mix together, and fry 
like hash. 

(3) I grind the meat, boiled potatoes and onion together, mix with an egg, shape into meat 
cakes, and fry. 

(4) I cut the meat into small pieces, add a medium-sized onion, chop fine and mix with the 
following dressing: One tablespoonful of butter, half a tablespoonful each of flour and sugar, one 
teaspoonful of mustard, one egg, half a cupful of vinegar and one cupful of milk. I mix it thor- 
oughly and cook five minutes, and add half a cupful of chopped sweet pickles. 

(5) I make one cupful and a half of white sauce, add a chopped hard-boiled egg, and to this 
add the chopped meat. I prepare a nest of mashed potatoes mixed with grated cheese, brown 
in oven, and fill with the meat mixture. 

(6) I scoop out the centers of six tomatoes, add the chopped meat, half a cupful of mayon- 
naise, two chopped pickles and a hard-boiled egg, refill the tomatoes, and serve on lettuce leaves. 

I WISH WOMEN KNEW HOW TO BUY MEAT AND SAVE THEMSELVES MONEY 

By a Butcher 

OF BEEF there are three grades: good, second-best and poor. Many women ask me if there is 
not as much nourishment in the cheapest grade as in the better grades. There is not, be- 
cause low-priced cattle are fed on brewer's (Igrains, cottonseed oil, etc., which fattens them but 
produces soft, flabby flesh. This shrinks to a greater extent in cooking. Besides there is as much 
bone in a thin animal as in a fat one. 

Good beef has firm fat tinged with pink, and the meat is interwoven with threads of fat. 
Poor beef has very yellow fat and the meat is lean and scraggy. 

A side of beef is divided into a forequarter and a hindquarter, the latter containing the loin 
from which the highest-priced steaks and roasts are cut. It is an easy rule to remember that meat 
is expensive in the center of the animal and cheaper at the extremities, chiefly because the latter 
meat is toughened by muscular action. Most people do not like the cheap cuts because they can- 
not cook them tender, and so buy steaks and roasts. Because of this excess demand we have to 
charge a very high price for them. 

Sometimes it seems that most women think a steer is made up entirely of ribs and loins ! 
There is one point, however, that people overlook, and that is, that most of the cheaper cuts have 
little waste, so that, besides costing less a pound, the meat goes almost twice as far. The waste 
from a two-pound sirloin steak averages about three-quarters of a pound. 

Too many of my customers buy unnecessarily in small quantities. When one's means are 
limited it is far better to buy in quantities sufficient for three days at a time. It is not necessary 
to prepare the meat always the same way, for I am glad to cut it for different uses. 

For instance, take a chuck rib of beef; it will weigh, say, fourteen pounds and a half and sells 
today as it falls for eighteen cents a pound, making a total of two dollars and sixty-one cents. 
From it I can cut two pounds and a half of soup meat, three pounds of meat which can be pot- 
roasted, and, after boning the rest, can make a delicious five-pound roast from it, which would 
ordinarily sell at thirty-five cents a pound. That leaves four pounds of bone and fat. 

The bone makes fine soup stock and the fat can be rendered for cooking. If bought sepa- 
rately these cuts would cost two dollars and ninety-five cents— an expenditure on the purchase 
of thirty-four cents above the price of the whole piece. 

Brisket is equally good corned or fresh. Although it contains considerable bone a six-pound 
piece, at eighteen cents, gives three pounds of meat for a pot roast, two pounds and a half of bone 
for stock and half a pound of fat to render. 

Another cut which comes from part of the hind-quarter is flank steak. This may be scored 
and broiled and served with a tomato sauce, or it may be made into a " blind duck." To do this 
it should be stuffed with chopped onions and potatoes well seasoned with salt, pepper and sage, 
tied securely and braised. Or it might be used for beef roulades with vegetables, in a stew, or 
boiled and made into a pie. It is clear meat with no waste when well trimmed, and it sells for 
from eighteen to twenty cents a pound. 

15 



Flank fat sells for ten and twelve cents a pound and can be rendered with practically no 
waste, and suet sells for about the same price. It is not economy to buy very cheap beef fat, 
because it contains so much meat fiber, that is waste. In fact, it always pays to purchase meats 
that are well trimmed, at a higher price a pound, than to buy cheaper grades that contain a great 
deal of waste. 

A rump weighs about twelve pounds and sells at twenty-three cents. From it can be obtained 
fine pot roasts or corned beef, with soup stock from the bones. The round is divided into two parts, 
the top and bottom, which are generally cut up into steaks. Those from the top are best and cost 
from twenty-eight to thirty cents— the bottom ones sell from twenty-five to twenty-eight cents 
at present, and if cut from good beef are tender. 

Out of a thirty-pound round I cut about twenty pounds of steak, the rest going to chopped 
meat and trimmings. When you see chopped beef for sale at a low price you can almost always 
be sure that it contains a high percentage of fat, and sometimes a great deal of water, for it is just 
as easy to " plump" beef as chicken or oysters. Better pay a little more and get honest meat. And 
if the market man will not let her see the meat chopped a woman had better grind her meat 
at home. 

The horseshoe is a small piece of clear meat weighing about two pounds and a half. It sells 
for twenty-two cents and makes an excellent pot roast or stew. 

The leg weighs about nineteen pounds and a quarter and sells at seventeen cents a pound as 
it falls. It contains about five pounds and a half of meat and fourteen pounds of bone. In this 
case it does not pay to buy the entire piece, as it is much cheaper to purchase the clear meat with 
as much bone as is needed. It makes an excellent shank stew. A shin cut from the forequarter 
may be used in a similar way. The forequarter chuck is not cheap at eighteen cents, as it contains 
so much bone, but it makes good stew or boiled beef. 

The season of the year makes considerable difference in the price of meats. From May to 
October the round and sirloin cuts arc more in demand and therefore cost more. Because of this, 
rib roasts drop in price, as few women cook roasts in summer, preferring steaks. In the autumn 
corned beef jumps in price for the same reason. 

Lamb goes up from March to May, while if spring lamb is late it is dear until July. Then is 
the time for women who have to be economical not to buy lamb, yet those are the very women 
who often do it. 

There are three grades of lamb, as of beef. Good lamb is not very heavy. If the leg joints 
are stiff the lamb is fresh, and the fat should be firm and white. The joints of fresh lamb can be 
easily separated to show the knuckle, while mutton is usually splintered at the joint. 

A lamb is divided into halves, each of which is separated into a forequarter and a hindquarter. 
An eight-pound-and-a-half forequarter at eighteen cents costs a dollar and fifty-three cents if 
purchased as it falls, and contains the rack from which the rib chops are cut. 

From this can be taken two pounds and a half of stew meat, one pound and a quarter of 
breast, four shoulder chops, which would be excellent either broiled or en casserole, and tw o pounds 
of chops from the rack, worth thirty-two cents a pound. Bought separately this would cost one 
dollar and seventy-five cents, or twenty-two cents more than for the whole piece. 

Besides this, there are enough trimmings for a nice barley stew. If desired the chuck, or 
shoulder, can be bought separately, and boned, rolled and dressed for roasting or braising; the 
chuck and breast can be purchased together, filled with a bread dressing and braised, or the shoul- 
der can be raised off for a casserole, the four chops under the shoulder cut out and the neck and 
bones used for a stew. Even a small family can dispose of a shoulder of lamb in this way if the 
woman is willing to cook a little. 

The whole hindquarter weighs about eight pounds and a quarter and sells for twenty-three 
cents, a total of a dollar and ninety cents. From it can be cut eight loin or kidney chops, which 
ordinarily sell for thirty-two cents a pound, and a six-pound roast, which would sell at twenty-five 
cents, and there is a small lamb kidney besides some trimmings. If purchased separately these 
cuts would cost two dollars and seventeen cents. The housewife saves a little more than ten per 
cent., and she will go a long way to save that on dry goods. 

Veal is divided like lamb and is becoming the most expensive of all meats. The shoulder and 
breast sell for about twenty-two cents a pound, and may be stuffed with a bread or a potato-and- 
onion dressing. 

The neck is used for stewing and the rump for pot-roasting or braising. The leg is worth 
about twenty-six cents a pound and weighs eleven pounds. It contains about right pounds of 
solid meat and three of bone, and costs, entire, a dollar and sixty-eight cents. From it is cut the 
fillet, which is sold for roasting at thirty-eight cents a pound, or is cut up into cutlets at forty cents 
a pound. 

The balance is used for stew or casserole. If purchased separately this amount of meat would 
cost two dollars and sixty-four cents, and any large family could dispose of the whole piece; but, 
as few wish to buy the knuckle, or end of the leg, it is necessary to charge a high price for the 
cutlets to make a small profit. 

As to pork, I think it strange that more shoulder pork chops are not purchased, as they 
average four cents less a pound than those in the loin and have no more waste. 

A loin of pork for roasting averages two cents a pound less than when cut up into chops, and 
contains only a third of bone waste. On the other hand, a fresh shoulder of ham, if well cut, is a 
cheaper roast and may be boned and stuffed to good advantage, while a fresh ham contains little 
waste and is as good eating as turkey; in fact, it is often preferred to turkey.
