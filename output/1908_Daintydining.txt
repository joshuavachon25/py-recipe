Potatoes should always be put into boiling water to cook. Add 
a spoonful of salt to every six good sized potatoes, When done, 
drain off the water, cover the kettle and let the potatoes stand a 
few minutes on the back of. stove. The steam makes them mealy 
and much nicer. 

In mashed potatoes use scalded milk. In preparing potatoes for 
frying, cut in the shape you desire and let them stand an hour in 
ice water. Drain and dry between towels. Have the fat so hot 
that the potato will brown quickly. As soon as they are brown 
take them out of the fat and always drain them on brown paper. 

POTATO PALLS 
Pare the potatoes, let stand in cold water an hour, cut with a 
small sized vegetable cutter, and fry in hot fat. If you use the

Roll in crumbs and egg, fry in deep, hot fat. Serve with white 
sauce. Six medium sized potatoes would make about a pint. Take 
a little of the potato in the hand and form into a small cup. Fill 
this cup with creamed chicken or peas, cover with potato, close the 
edges, form into a roll about three inches long, roll in crumbs and 
egg and fry as directed. Creamed fish is also good for a filling.

GAME 

Game should be kept until tender. White-flesh game should be 
cooked until well done; dark-flesh game may be served underdone. 
Wild geese or ducks should be young, [t requires a certain amount 
of experience to select game; if you cannot trust your own judg- 
ment, better leave it to your market man. The usual way of cook- 
ing game is by roasting or broiling, but there are more fanciful 
ways. The French methods are very nice but we are using more 
simple receipts, and so we will keep to the general rules. Re- 
member to have a bright tire. Small birds should be lightly 
browned and this takes but a short time. Split the birds down the 
back, wipe carefully with a damp cloth, season with salt and pep- 
per, rub them over with butter and flour mixed, and brown in hot 
oven. For broiling quail or squab, fifteen minutes is sufficient. To 
roast birds, wipe carefully and season. Put on top of each bird a 
thin slice of bacon or pork, bake twenty minutes in hot oven. 
Serve on toast, cover with bread sauce, garnish with jelly. 

GAME PIE ( Algonquin < 'in; I 

Grouse or quail make a fine pie. < 'lean and wipe the birds; 
divide the quail in halves, the grouse in quarters. Six birds for a 
good sized pie. Put the neck and giblets with the inferior portions 
of bird into a saucepan with three cups of water. While this is 
stewing make a good puff paste and line a pudding dish. Reserve 
enough of the paste for a cover half an inch thick. When the gib- 
lets are tender take them out and let the gravy stew in a covered 
saucepan. Put tiny strips of pork on the birds, chop a slice fine 
and put with the giblets. Season with chopped parsley, marjoram, 
small onion, juice of a lemon, cup of bread crumbs moistened with 
warm milk. Mix witli the giblets a little pepper and salt, making 
a force-meat. Put the paste in the bottom of the baking-dish with 
very thin slices of corned ham. Upon this place the birds, but- 
tered, then a layer of the force-meat, and so on until nearly full. 
Then add the strained gravy, hot, and a glass of sherry. Cover 
with the upper crust. lie sure to cut a small slit in the top of the 
crust to allow the gases to escape. It requires three hours for a 
large pie to bake. Cover it with paper when it begins to brown. 

BIRDS WITH MUSHROOMS 

Plover or reed-birds are very nice with mushrooms. This is a 
simple rule and appetizing. Two dozen small birds, truss them, 
put into each a button mushroom, a large pint of mushrooms. Put 
the birds and the mushrooms left into a saucepan, season with salt 
and pepper, a fourth of a lb. of butter divided into four parts, rolled 
a little in flour, a pint of rich cream. Cover saucepan closely and 
stew over a slow fire until the birds are tender. Do not stir the 
stew, but give the pan an occasional shake. Serve on thin slices of 
buttered toast with the mushrooms all around. 



RICE 1'IE (L. P. I 

( me quart of rice, picked and washed well through two waters, 
tie into a bag and put into a pot of boiling water. Boil until per- 
fectly soft, drain and press as divas possible and mix with two 

S] nfuls butter and two spoonfuls grated cheese. Put the rice 

into a small bread-loaf pan, (wet the pan) and let the rice stand in 
it until cold, then turn it out carefully to keep it in form. Rub it 
Over with the beaten yolk of an egg, and brown in the oven. When 
well browned cut from the top a lid about one and one-half inches 
deep. Scoop nut the center of the loaf, leaving a crust all around 
anil on the bottom. Fill it with stewed game, oysters creamed, or 
curried chicken. Place the rice cover on top and serve with grape 
jelly. 

ROAST DUCK 

Dies-., i lean and truss a wild duck, place cm rack in dripping-pan, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover breast with two thin slices 
ill salt pork. Place in body of duck a half cup of cranberries, cook 
twenty minutes, basting twice while baking. Remove the cran- 
berries before sending to the table. Serve with cherry sauce. Broil 
duck fifteen or twenty minutes inside down. 

POPPED PIGEONS (Mrs. Tinker) 

One dozen pigeons, half lb. salt pork, two onions. Stuff the 
pigeons with dressing made of two cups of bread crumbs, one egg, 
teaspoonful pepper, teaspoonfu! salt, a little chopped parsley, butter 
the si/e of an egg. Put them closely together in the pan, with a 
sheet steamer in the bottom of the pot so the birds will not touch 
the bottom of the pot. Fry the pork and pour the hot fat over the 
birds before you add any water, let them stand ten minutes, then 
add boiling water enough to cover. Add one do/en cloves, the 
onions, and cover closely. Stew an hour and a half, take out the 
pigeons, thicken the gravy, add two spoonfuls red wine. I'our the 
gravv over the pigeons, tuck the piece oi pork under their wings, 
garnish with beet balls and Palls made of mush, carrots cut in fancy 
shapes and small bread-stii ks. 

Hint: Wild ducks require no stuffing and should be served 
quite rare. From one-half to three-quarters of an hour in a hot 
o\ en is sufficient time for roasting. Serve a green salad with ducks, 
of lettuce and beans with French dressing. Bread sauce for par- 
tridges and other small game, excepting when a special sauce is 
ad\ ised. 

COOKING VENISON (Miss Farmers Rule) 

('ut the steaks of venison and shape them in small rounds. Put 
around each and fasten securely a thin slice of salt pork; cook in 
hot fixing pan until well seared on both sides, then place in oven 
to finish cooking. Serve with Londerry sauce. To make same: 
Cook two table spoonfuls citron and lemon /est, cut in thin strips, 
m a half cup of port wine for three minutes. Add half a cup cur- 
rant jelly and stir until melted. Season with salt and cayenne. 

74 



GOOSE 

Parboil the goose before roasting; take it out of the water at 
once when it is tendered; if left to cool in water it absorbs the oil 
which we wish to extract. Stuff the goose with any of the dressings 
given. Roast in good, hot oven.

SUGGESTIONS FOR CAKE MAKING 

In making cake it is always better to follow a good rule rather 
than add to or take from, in other words, better follow your rule 
and guess on something else. The result will be more satisfactory. 

Cream the butter and add the sugar slowly, then the milk and 
flour, alternating, beginning with the flour, and last the whites of 
eggs well beaten and the flavoring or the fruit, or both. Bake in 
moderate oven. Cover with paper if baking too fast. Open and 
close the oven door carefully, as delicate cake falls when the air 
strikes it, when the oven door is opened and closed quickly. Try 
the cake with a straw or listen to it. If it sings let it stay in the 
oven a little longer. The firmness of the cake depends much on 
the mixing of the butter and sugar. It should be very light in 
quality and color.

FOR AFTERNOON TEA 

Afternoon tea has become a custom. The sociability and friend- 
liness of the custom has made it a habit no one seems willing to 
give up. The following rules for making tea will be found accep- 
table, although the grandmother's rule is a household word: 
Except the kettle boiling be, 
Filling the teapot spoils the tea." 

I can recommend Chase & Sanborn's Orange Pekoe Blend; also 
another blend sent me by a friend who is a fine judge of delicacies: 
Take one part each of Oolong, Young Hyson, Imperial, and Japan, 
two parts English Breakfast. Mix thoroughly. Use one tea- 
spoonful of this mixture to one cup boiling water. Let it steep 
three minutes. Never let tea boil. To each cup of tea, when 
serving, add a little lemon syrup and half teaspoonful of Jamaica 
rum, one lump of sugar in saucer if a guest requires more than the 
syrup gives. 

ICED TEA 

Four hours before tea is required, or over night if desired, put 
four teaspoonfuls of tea in a pitcher and pour over it one quart of 
cold water. Cover closely and set it in ice chest. Sweeten as any 
other tea. I advise a syrup made of sugar and water and boil five 
or six minutes. More sugar and a slice of lemon can be added if 
required. 

LEMON SYRUP FOR TEA 
Boil one cup sugar, one-third cup water, five minutes. Take from 
stove and when cool add one-third cup lemon juice. 

CHOCOLATE 

One quart of milk in double boiler; let come to a boil. Have 
prepared two squares of Baker's chocolate grated fine and mixed 
with equal parts granulated sugar. Mix in thoroughly with a 
wooden spoon. Boil slowly until the particles of chocolate are all 
dissolved. Set on back of stove until ready to serve. Add one- 
half teaspoonful vanilla. Serve with whipped cream, chilling the 
cream before whipping. A spoonful of sherry in the bottom of 
each cup is an agreeable addition. 

COFFEE 

One tablespoonful of coffee for each cup of water. Six spoonfuls 
of coffee, six cups cold water, one egg and the crushed shell. Mix 
egg thoroughly with coffee, pour on the cold water, let it stand over 
night. In the morning put on stove in coffee pot, let boil three 
minutes. Set back on stove to keep hot. Serve as soon as pos- 
sible. Put a cone of paper in the nose of coffee pot to keep the 
strength from escaping. 

135 



CREOLE COFFEE (Mrs. Williams) 

Put strong coffee made by the above rule in a lighted urn; a 
small bowl of lump sugar, dish of candied cherries, orange peel, 
whole spices, small flask of nice brandy. Use a wide-mouthed sil- 
ver bowl. Put into bowl two lumps of sugar for each person, one 
spoonful of whole cloves, three sticks of cinnamon, broken, one 
tablespoonful orange peel. Cover this with the brandy and let it 
burn off, stirring occasionally with silver ladle. When alcohol is 
burned off turn in the coffee until bowl is full. Stir again and serve 
in small after-dinner cups. 

FRUIT PUNCH 

The juice of twelve lemons, twelve oranges, two lbs. sugar, one 
pint Santa Cruz rum, one pint sherry, half pint brandy, one cup 
strong green tea; let this stand several hours in a bowl surrounded 
with ice. I'eel and cut into dice one large pineapple, add to the 
punch, also one cup ripe strawberries if in season. Just before serv- 
ing add a quart of champagne. Use the same foundation, leaving 
out the Heritors for afternoon punch. 

STRAWBERRY COCKTAIL 

Juice of two lemons and one orange, one cup of sugar dissolved 
in one cup of water, one pint sherry, two teaspoonfuls rum. Fill 
small glasses with the liquid; put the glass in center of a glass plate 
with cracked ice around it. Arrange fresh berries with stems on, on 
the ice. Dip berries into liquor using stems of the berries, or an 
oyster fork. 

FCC, LEMONADE 

Break an egg into a tumbler, rub two lumps of sugar on the rind 
of a lemon, getting as much of the oil as possible. Tut the sugar 
in the tumbler, squeeze the juice of the lemon into it and half fill 
the tumbler with cracked ice. Fill it up with water and shake vig- 
orously with a shaker. Grate a little nutmeg over the top. If you 
have no shaker beat the egg with a fork. 

RASPBERRY SHRUB (Mrs. Deering) 

Eight quarts of berries, three pints of vinegar, not too strong. 
Let stand four days, stirring and mashing the fruit every day. 
Strain twice through a bag. Add three lbs. of cut sugar to one 
quart of the juice. Let it simmer an hour. Skim carefully, when 

i old, bottle. Tut twos] nfuls of shrub in tumbler and till it up 

with cold water. 

[( F COCOA ( Rita Simpson I 

Make cocoa a little stronger than usual; when cold put in ice 
chest until thoroughly chilled; add a little vanilla. Serve with 
sugar and cream in after-dinner coffee cups with whipped cream on 
top and a little chopped ice. 

136 



CIDER CUP (H. W.) 

One pint of cider, one glass of sherry, one cherry-glass of brandy, 
one liqueur glass curacao, a piece of ice, one-half orange sliced, the 
rind of the lemon, one slice of cucumber, a little nutmeg, sugar to 
taste. 

MINT CORDIAL (Mrs. Dyer) 

Crush a bunch of mint so every leaf will be broken. Soak for an 
hour in the juice of three lemons and the grated rind of one. Boil 
together two cups of sugar and two cups of water until syrup 
threads. Take from fire, stir in the lemon and mint, the juice of an 
orange and a pineapple. Cool and strain, add water enough to 
suit your taste. Serve with shaved ice.

142 



GENERAL REMARKS 

An acid sauce is the most suitable sauce for fish. Tartar, Sauc 
Piquant, stewed gooseberry, grated horse-radish sauce with veal or 
beef. Bread sauce, celery, olives, cranberry jelly and cranberry 
sauce with chicken or turkey. Beaunaise sauce, mushroom, horse- 
radish or oyster with beefsteak. Crape jelly, celery sauce and 
black currants with venison. Dread sauce, celery with quail and 
squab. Cream sauce with fried chicken. Sweet pepper salad and 
corn fritters with cold tongue. 

Use "latest wrinkle peas" with cream sauce, when fresh peas are 
out of season. 

Color cream of celery soup with a pinch of green coloring, spinach 
or leaf green. 

When sweet-breads first come from the market, put them in cold 
water for two or three hours, then remove the membranes, cut with 
silver knife, put in salted water with a tablespoonful of lemon juice. 
The lemon juice is added to harden them. Heart sweet-breads are 
best. 

If baking powder is used in cake, add it the last thing after the 
other ingredients have been well mixed, just before baking. 
Zest is the outside rind of a lemon or orange. 

One or two spoonfuls of sherry served in each cup of chocolate 
makes a good change. 

Nothing new under the sun ! " 

There are many ways of doing the same thing, as you have no 
doubt already discovered. You will also find that the foundation 
of all mixtures which seem new, are really the good, old, tried 
recipes, many of which I have given. I have not attempted to 
tempt you with high-art cookery, or many fancy dishes. These 
change as new products appear in the market. I do believe in fol- 
lowing the way pointed out in this collection of recipes, you will 
have no reason to find fault with the result. 

A tablespoonful of vinegar in hot lard will prevent doughnuts 
from soaking fat. 

A few drops of lavender oil in a dish of hot water set in the 
dining room just before dinner is served, gives a delightful freshness 
to the atmosphere of the room. 

Pass salted nuts, olives and radishes, all through the dinner. 

Use thin soups for dinners, thicker soups for luncheons. 

Half a slice of bread in the cake box will keep the cake moist. 

Do not use a dover egg beater for beating meringue, but an egg 
whip until the whites are frothy. Then add a small lump of cream 
of tartar and whip again. 

Use Gebhardt's Eagle Chili Powder for the Mexican recipes. 

C'EST TOUT

THE SPOILER 

A woman there was and she wrote for the press, 

(As you or I might do); 
She told how to cut and fit a dress, 
And how to stew many a savory mess, 
But she had never done it herself ; I guess, — 

(Which none of her readers knew). 

Oh ! the hour we spent and the flour we spent, 

And the sugar we wasted like sand, 
At the hest of a woman who never had cooked, 
(And now we know that she never could cook) 
And did not understand. 

A woman there was and she wrote right fair, 

(As you or I might do), 
How out of a barrel to make a chair, 
To be covered with chintz and stuffed with hair, 
T would adorn any parlor and give it an air ! 

(And we thought the tale was true). 

Oh ! the days we worked and the ways we worked, 

To hammer and saw and hack, 
In making a chair in which no one could sit, — 
A chair in which no one could possibly sit. 

Without a crick in his back. 

A woman there was and she had her fun, 

(Better than you or 1) ; 
She wrote recipes and she never tried one, 
She wrote about children, — of course she had none ; 
She told us to do what she never had done, 

(And never intended to try). 

And it isn't the toil and it isn't the spoil, 

That brims the cup of disgrace ; 
It's to follow a woman who didn't know beans, 
(A woman who never had cooked any beans), 

But wrote and was paid to fill space. 

— Congregationalist.
