three and a-half gills sweet milk and water, or milk alone; drop 
with a spoon into the " Gem " baking pan. Before mixing the

touch the pan. 

Com Cake. — One cup of corn meal, one cup of milk, one- 
fourth cup of sugar, two eggs, one and one-fourth cup of flour, 
one teaspoonful of soda, and two of cream of tartar, three table-

last thing put in half teaspoon soda, or more according to sour- 
ness of milk. This is very nice for breakfast or tea, with maple 
syrup.

one-half cup sugar, two small teaspoonsful soda, one-half cup

PART II. 

Meats, Fowl, Soups, Etc. 

Chicken Pie. — Two young chickens boiled tender, line the 
sides of baking dish with puff paste, put a layer of chicken, 
place strips of pastry over with lumps of fresh butter, pepper and 
salt sprinkled over, then cover the top with rich puff paste, bake 
in slow oven, don't let it get dry, keep juicy with soup from 
chicken. 

Southern Chicken Pie. — Boil a chicken until it is tender, 
then take a deep earthen dish and put into it a layer of the chick- 
en, well seasoned with butter, pepper and salt, then put a layer 
of cold boiled rice on this, and so on until you have exhausted 
your resources, taking care to have a layer of rice on top. Put 
this into the oven and let it remain there until it is very hot and 
then serve. 

Chicken Pie. — Crust, one quart of flour, three heaping tea- 
spoons of baking powder, one small teaspoon of salt. Mix these 
well together with the hand. Rub into this mixture one table- 
spoon of butter, and one tablespoon of lard. When thoroughly 
mixed, add just enough milk to make a soft dough. Stir with 
hand quickly, without much kneading. Then roll out about 
three-fourths of an inch thick. Inside, take a chicken. Clean 
and cut up. Cut thin slices of salt fat pork. Put a thick layer 
of pork slices in the bottom of a stew pan. On these lay the 
fowl. Add a very little salt and pepper. Just cover the chicken 
with water and close the pan tightly. Let it stew very slowly 
for half an hour. Then take out the pieces of chicken and place 
into a pie dish. Take some of the gravy and stir in a large 
spoonful of flour. Season, and pour over the chicken. Cut a 
piece of butter in thin slices and lay on top of the fowl. Cover 
with the crust. Bake half an hour and serve hot. 

Chicken Stew. — Cut up two fo\^ Is, fry out three slices of 
pork, add a small onion, sliced, and cook until done. Lay in the 
chicken, and season each layer with salt and a little pepper, 
cover with water. When nearly tender add five or six potatoes, 



1:aE llELlABLfi cooK BOOK. 15 

sliced. Cover with dumplings. When the chicken is taken iip, 
there should be just liquid enough left to thicken for a gravy. 

Fricasseed Chicken. — Put the chicken, cut up, into a 
saucepan with barely enough water to cover it, and stew gently 
till tender. Have a frying pan with a few slices of salt pork in 
it; drain the chicken and fry with the pork until of a rich brown; 
then remove from the pan, and put in the broth in which the 
chicken was stewed ; thicken with browned flour mixed smooth 
in a little water, and season with pepper. Put the chicken and 
pork back into the gravy, let it simmer a few minutes and serve 
hot. 

Chicken Pie. — Boil chickens in water, barely to cover them, 
forty minutes. Skim the water carefully. Take them out in a 
dish, and cut them up as they should be carved if placed upon 
the table. If the skin is very thick, remove it. Have ready, 
lined with a thick paste, a deep dish of a size proportionate to 
the number of chickens you wish to use; put in the pieces, with 
the hearts and livers, in layers; sprinkle each layer with flour, 
salt and pepper, and put on each piece of chicken a thin layer of 
butter; do this until you have laid in all the pieces; put rather 
more of the spice, flour and butter over the top layer than on the 
previous ones, and pour in as much of the liquor in which the 
chickens were boiled as j'ou can without danger of its boiling 
over. Lay on the upper crust, and close the edges very carefully 
with flour and water; prick the top with a knife; cut leaves of 
crust and ornament it. Bake two hours. The crust for chicken 
pie should be twice as thick as for fruit pies. Use mace and nut- 
meg if you wish. 

Chicken Salad. — Take the chicken off of the bones. Cut 
it into dice like pieces. Wash a head of celery, and, also, cut 
into dice like pieces. Mix with the chicken. Pour over it May- 
onnaise dressing. Garnish with olives and cold boiled eggs, and 
serve. 

Salmi of Duck. — Cut up cola duck, as for fricassee. Put 
it in a pan with one ounce of butter. Fry brown quickly. When 
done add a pint of onions. Just cover with boiling water. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper. Take some stale bread. Cut in heart 
shaped pieces. Brown them in a quick oven. When the salmi

is done, pour it upon a hot dish. Garnisli it with the bread, and 
serve. 

Broiled Bacon. — Dip slices of thin bacon in bread crumbs, 
fry on a hot gridiron, turn when done. Serve with gravy made of 
sweet cream, parsley, season with pepper and salt. 

Fried Apples and Bacon. — Core and slice round, without 
paring, some tart, well-flavored apples. Cut into thin slices some 
middlings of excellent bacon or pork, and fry in their own fat al- 
most to crispness. Take out the meat and keep hot while you fry 
the apples in the fat left in the pan ; add a little sugar to taste. 
Drain, and lay upon the slices of meat. 

Cold Beef.— One cup of cold beef, chopped fine, one egg, 
one-third cup bread crumbs ; season with pepper, salt and sage 
and make into balls and fry in butter or lard. 

Beef Cakes. — Chop up some beef that is partly cooked with 
a little smoked pork fat and season with salt, pepper and onions; 
mix well and form into small cakes. Fry them light brown and 
serve with a good gravy made of soup stock thickened with 
brown flour. 

Beef Fritters. — Good for breakfast. Chop pieces of steak 
or cold roast beef very fine. Make a batter of milk, flour and an 
egg, and mix the meat with it. Season with pepper, salt and a 
little parsley. Put a lump of butter into a saucepan, let it melt, 
then drop the batter into it from a large spoon. Fry until brown. 

Cold Beef. — Mince it fine, with pepper, salt and onions, 
some rich gravy, and put it into tins three parts full, fill them up 
with mashed potatoes and brown in oven. 

A Breakfast Dish. — Take cold beef, pork or veal, the more 
variety the better, and hash it fine, mix with two eggs, and a 
little grated onion (or not as preferred), a little melted butter, two 
pounded crackers and pepper and salt to taste; roll in balls, and 
fry in butter flavored with lemon juice. 

Breakfast Dish No. 2. — Take some cold boiled or baked 
meat, chop it fine, then put in about the same amount of toma- 
toes, either canned or fresh, and chop them fine and mix well to- 
gether. Put a layer of bread crumbs in a buttered pan, put the 
meat and tomatoes in, seasoned with salt and pepper, then an-

other layer of bread crumbs. Pour a cup of water, or the water 
ill which meat has been boiled is better, over the top and bake 
one hour in a moderate oven. 

Ham Balls.— Take two well-beaten eggs and half a cup of 
bread crumbs, mix well together and add some tine chopped 
ham. Make into cakes and fry in hot fat. 

Rissoles. — To make rissoles take any kind of nice cold roast 
meat, chop it fine, salt and spice it to taste. Roll a tablespoon - 
ful in very thin pastry crust, and fry quickly in butter or lard. 

Spiced Beef. — Five pounds of the shank boiled five hours 
with celery seed. Drain off the gelatine and then chop the meat 
very fine, and pepper and salt to taste, and put it into a cloth on 
a platter. Cover with a cloth and press. 

Spiced Beef.— Boil a piece of beef in a quart of water until 
very tender, take from the water, chop fine, season with salt, 
pepper, a half teaspoonful of cloves; add water in which the 
meat was boiled, place in a mould, place weight on and press. 
When well pressed together, cut it into slices. Any piece of 
beef will answer for spiced beef, unless too fat. 

Beef Shank. — Boil till the meat will slip off the bones readi- 
ly, take out bones, chop up meat and season to taste; we generally 
only use salt and pepper; put back the liquid in which it was 
boiled, let it boil, and then turn out in a deep dish to cool; when 
cold slice and serve. 

Beef Tea. — Chop a piece of lean beef, put in an earthern 
jar, cover close and set in a kettle of water; boil four or five 
hours, or until juice is all extracted; salt and strain. 

Stewed Beef with Onions. — Cover the bottom of a frying 
pan with thinly shaved slices of fat pork. When the fat is all 
tried out, lay in a thick steak cut from the round, and let it 
brown upon both sides; then take it off and add one tablespoon- 
ful of flour to the pork; stir it till it is smooth, then put in a pint 
of water, a tablespoonful of catsup, a teaspoonful of currant 
jelly and a large onion, chopped fine. Add salt and pepper to 
the taste, and put the^ steak back in the gravy to boil slowly for 
two hours and a-half, covering closely and adding more water

Roast of Calf s Liver. — Wash thoroughly and wipe dry; 
cut a long, deep hole in the side, stuff with crumbs, onion and 
bacon, chopped; salt and pepper to taste, a bit of butter and one 
egg; sew or tie together the liver, lard it over and bake in the 
oven, basting often; serve with gravy and currant jelly. 

Dried Beef in Cream. — Shave the beef very fine, pour over 
it boiling water and let stand a little while. Pour off the water 
and pour off good rich cream and let come to a boil. If you 
have not cream use milk and butter thickened with a little flour, 
season with pepper and serve on toast. 

Fresh Pork and Potatoes.— Take a roast of ^ork, sprinkle 
it with sage and salt, and put into the oven to roast. Two hours 
before dinner have prepared enough potatoes for the family; put 
them in the dripping-pan under the pork; when done they should 
be nicely browned. 

Mock Duck. — Take some round steak, make a stuffing as 
for turkey, spread over the steak, roll it up and tie it, roast about 
three-quarters of an hour. 

Veal Pie. — Stew small pieces of veal until tender ; sea- 
son with butter, pepper and salt. Thicken the broth (of which 
have plenty), with batter made of milk, flour and a well-beaten 
egg. Pour into a deep pan and cover with a rich biscuit dough, 
bake until a nice brown. 

Rabbit Pie. — Cut up, soak in salt water half an hour, and 
boil nearly tender. Cut some fat pork in strips, and boil two 
eggs hard ; put in the pie dish, lined with paste, a layer of the pork, 
then rabbit, slices of egg, salt, pepper, butter, mace, and lemon 
juice ; thicken with flour the water the rabbit was boiled in, 
pour over, cover with paper, and bake one hour. 

Beefsteak and Onions. — Cut up six onions very fine ; put 
tnem in a saucepan with two cupf uls of hot water, about two 
ounces of good butter, some pepper and salt ; dredge in flour. 
Stew until the onions are quite soft ; then have the steak broiled; 
put into the saucepan with the onions ; simmer about ten minutes 
and send to the table very hot. 



THE HELIABLEi COOK BOOK. 19 

Stuffed Beefsteak. — Take a rump steak about an inch 
thick, make a stuflSng the usual way, spread over the steak, roll 
up and tie securely, put in an iron kettle with not too much water 
and stew slowly about two hours, when done thicken the gravy 
and pour over, carve in slices through the steak and stuffing. 

Hamburg Steak with Onions. — Take of the upper cut 
of a round of beef one and one-half pounds. Add to it a small 
bit of fat. Have the butcher chop it fine. Form it with the 
hands into a flat oval shape about an inch thick. Place it 
carefully on the broiler (do not break it), and J)roil just as you 
would a steak, turning often. It is much nicer if left a little rare. 
When done remove to the platter and pour over two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter, a little salt and pepper, and the onions pre- 
viously cooked. Clean six onions. Chop fine. Put a table- 
spoonful of suet in an iron spider ; one teaspoonf ul of sugar and 
the chopped onions, with a little salt and pepper. Cook one-half 
hour or until tender, turning occasionally. Keep them closely 
covered. When done pour over the steak. 

Hamburg Steak. — Chop one pound of round steak fine, sea- 
son with a tablespoonful of onion juice, a little black pepper and 
half a teaspoonf ul of salt ; mix well, form in small, flat cakes and 
fry in hot lard. Make gravy and pour over. 

Boiled Beefsteak. — Take two pounds of round steak, cut 
in a thick slice. Make a stuffing of a cup of bread crumbs and a 
teaspoonful of melted butter. Season with sage, salt and pepper. 
Lay the steak on a board, trim off the fat and hack one side of 
it thoroughly with a knife. Do not cut through the steak. 
Spread the stuffing on the chopped side, roll the meat over and 
fasten with wooden toothpicks to keep it. Put over it a few thin 
slices of salt pork. Then tie all up nicely with twine. Lay in a 
saucepan with a pint of water and a piece of carrot and onion 
cut fine, a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vinegar. Let 
this simmer for three hours ; then take it up, remove the string 
and toothpicks, sprinkle flour over it and set in the oven to 
brown. Skim gravy, and when meat is browned pour over it and 
serve. This is very nice when well cooked. The success of the 
dish depends on simmering slowly and browning quickly. 



20 THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

Steak Rolled and Baked— Dust a little pepper and salt 
over a nice steak cut not more than half an inch thick. Prepare 
a forcemeat by mixing a quarter pound of sifted bread crumbs 
with two dessertspoonfuls finely chopped suet, one dessertspoonful 
chopped parsley and a small piece of lemon peel shred very fine. 
Season with salt and pepper, and bind the mixture with a well 
beaten egg. Place this forcemeat on one end of the steak, roll up 
tightly as possible, bind securely with twine, ends and all, to pre- 
vent the escape of the forcemeat. Wrap the rolled steak in a 
well-greased paper and lay it in a dripping pan in which is two 
ounces of hot dripping. Bake in a hot oven, basting frequently. 
Allow twenty minutes for each pound of steak. Ten minutes 
before taking from the oven remove the paper to let the outside 
brown. Serve with hot boiled potatoes and brown gravy. 

Pea Soup.— Use one pint of dried peas for every four quarts 
of soup. Wash the peas well, then put them in six quarts of 
cold water. Let them come slowly to a boil. Add some kind of 
a meat bone, with a carrot and an onion. Simmer for three hours. 
Strain through a sieve. Place on the fire again, and put in one 
tablespoon of flour, and the same of butter, mix together. Cut 
some bread into dice- like pieces, and brown in the oven. Place 
them in the bottom of a tureen, and pour the soup over them. 

Pea Soup.— Take one-third of a pound of split peas. Put 
into three pints of water. Cut the pork into pieces the size of 
dice, with one onion, one-half bunch of parsley chopped fine. 
Boil all two hours. Add water, so that when done there will be 
three pints. 

Tomato Soup. (Equal to oyster).— Cook till done one quart 
of tomatoes, add first one teaspoon saleratus, then pepper freely, 
half cup butter, then add two quarts new milk, let boil till it 
boils to the top of kettle, then set off and add salt to taste. 

Tomato Soup. — Take one-half can tomatoes, stew and strain 
through a sieve ; season to taste with pepper, salt, a little sugar 
and butter 

Tomato Soup. — One quart tomatoes, one small onion cut 
fine, one quart water, one level tablespoon of salt, black pepper 
or red pepper. Boil forty-five minutes. Sift it. Wherji it comes 



THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 21 

to boiling again put in three tablespoons of browned flour stirred 
with a little cold milk, a pinch of soda and a pint of milk and let 
it boil twenty minutes. Butter the size of an egg. 

Tomato Soup. — One quart of tomatoes, two heaping table- 
spoons flour, one tablespoon butter, one teaspoon sugar (some use 
twice as much), one teaspoon salt, one pint hot water. Let the 
tomatoes and water come to a boil ; rub the flour, butter and one 
spoonful of the tomatoes together, and stir into the boiling mix- 
ture. Season to taste, and boil fifteen minutes longer. Rub 
through a sieve, and serve with a piece of butter and nicely -toast- 
ed bread. Extra nice. 

Green Corn Soup is one of the most delicious of vegetable 
soups for Summer. Scrape or cut the thinnest possible shaving 
from each row of corn on the cob, and with the back of a knife 
press out the pulp, leaving the hull on the cob. There should be 
about a pint of thiis pulp. Break the cobs and put on to boil in 
enough cold water to cover them, boil thirty minutes and strain. 
There should be about a pint of this corn water, and when it boils 
again add the corn pulp, and cook fifteen minutes. Add salt, 
pepper, a half teaspoonful sugar, and a pint of boiling milk or 
cream. Thicken with a teaspoonful of flour cooked in a table- 
spoonful of butter. Boil a minute or two and serve at once. 

Spinach Soup. — Wash and trim one quart of spinach and 
put into a saucepan holding three quarts of boiling water and 
three tablespoonfuls of salt. Boil rapidly with the cover off till 
tender, which will be in about eight minutes. Next drain through 
a colander, run plenty of cold water on it, chop fine and rub 
through a sieve with a wooden spoon. While the spinach is boil- 
ing prepare the soup as follows : Put the milk over the fire to 
boil, first putting into the saucepan two gills of cold water to pre- 
vent burning. Mix together over the fire one ounce of butter, 
the same of flour, till they bubble ; then slowly add the boiling 
milk, season with salt to taste, half a saltspoonf ul of white pepper, 
one-quarter of a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, stir in enough 
spinach to color a light green and serve hot. 

Lobster Stew, — Select two medium sized lobsters, pick out 
all the meat, also all -the inside dressing and chop all together; 
have milk, butter, pepper and salt all hot and add the lobster 



22 THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

with one small tablespoon of sugar, let boil up once and serve 
with oyster crackers, just the same as oyster stew. 

Julienne Soup. — Make a stock as for clear soup. Finely 
shred half an ounce of onion, quarter of an ounce of celery leaves, 
and three ounces each of cabbage, string-beans, carrot, and white 
and yellow turnips. Gently simmer all together till the vegeta- 
bles are tender. Season. Chop up the yolk of a hard boiled egg, 
and put in just before serving. 

Calf's Head Soup. — Put the head on in water enough to 
cover it entirely, and let it boil until the bones will slip out. Then 
take it out on a dish, throw the bones back into the pot, lay the 
brains on a plate, chop the head and tongue quite fine and season 
highly with pepper, salt and onions. Then take the bones out 
again, put back the meat and throw in a dozen grains of allspice. 
Take the brains, with a small portion of the tongue chopped very 
fine; season with salt, pepper and parsley and add stale bread 
crumbs suflScient to make into balls the size of a walnut. Then 
beat well the yolk of an egg, roll the balls in it, dust them with 
flour, fry them a nice brown and put them in the soup dish before 
putting in the soup. This soup is greatly improved by adding 
a gill of wine, one of mushroom and one of walnut catsup, just 
before serving. Thicken with browned flour. 

Rivel Soup. — Allow a quart or more sweet milk to come to 
a boil. Rub an egg into about a pint of flour till it is in fine 
crumbs, then stir slowly into boiling milk, add salt, and serve 
immediately. 

Vermicelli Soup. — Blanch the vermicelli by putting the 
paste into plenty of boiling water, with one tablespoon of salt to 
each quart of water. Boil until tender. Drain it, and put into 
cold water until wanted. To every quart of stock add one ounce 
of vermicelli. Put into the hot soup long enough to heat thor- 
oughly, before serving. Season. 

Mock Turtle Soup.— Take a calf's head which has been 
thoroughly cleaned. Remove brains and boil separately. Put 
the head in a pot with more water than will cover it. Let it boil 
for an hour and skim frequently. Take it out and when cool cut 
the meat into pieces about an inch square. Scrape and cut the 
tongue in the same manner. Lay all these pieces aside, then put 



TECE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 33 

into the water in which the head was boiled about three pounds 
of leg of beef and a knuckle of veal, the meat cut small and the 
bones broken. Add four or five onions, a small bunch of herbs, 
a carrot and turnip sliced and some whole black pepper. Boil 
slowly four or five hours, take off, cool, and strain, remove all 
fat. Put a good sized lump of butter in a stew pan, add two 
handf uls of flour, let it brown, stirring all the time. Add a little 
of the soup, a sprig or two of parsley and boil fifteen minutes, 
strain and add to the rest of the soup, with the brains pounded, 
and boil for thirty minutes. Add a glass of sherry, if liked, and 
when in tureen put in some force meat balls. 

Celery Soup. — One pint of milk and a little over a pint of 
boiling water; rub together one tablespoonful of butter and two 
of flour; stir into boiling milk until smooth; add one teaspoonful 
of salt and one of celery extract; use one-half a bunch of celery, 
boiled (leaves and all) in the water given in the recipe; boil one 
hour. 

Bean Soup.— One pint of soup beans, one medium sized 
onion, one large tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to suit 
the taste. Pick over the beans, wash clean, and soak over night; 
in the morning drain off the water and put them in a kettle with 
two quarts of cold w^ater. Let them boil slowly until they are 
tender; slice the onion very thin and add to the soup with the 
butter, pepper and salt. When the onion is tender, pass the soup 
through a coarse sieve, and serve very hot. A few hard boiled 
eggs sliced in the soup just before serving is an improvement. 

Potato Soup. — For this use three potatoes boiled soft in 
salted w^ater or a pint (two cupf uls) of mashed potato left from 
dinner. Cook a small onion and a stalk of celery with a pint of 
milk in a double boiler, add to .the potatoes with salt and pepper, 
celery salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper, rub through the 
strainer and put on to boil. Thicken with half a tablespoonful 
of butter, and let it boil five minutes, adding more hot milk if too 
thick, and serving very hot. An ornamental effect and an agree- 
able flavor to many is gained by adding a tablespoonful of finely 
chopped parsley just before serving. 

Potato Soup. — Wash and pare three potatoes and let them 
soak in cold water for half an hour. Put them into boiling water 



24 THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

and cook very soft. Put a pint of milk on to boil in the double 
boiler with a teaspoonful of chopped onion and a stalk of celery. 
When the potatoes are done drain and mash them. Add the 
boiling milk and season with one teaspoonful of salt and a little 
pepper. Rub through a strainer, and put on to boil again. Melt 
a teaspoonful of butter in a small dish. Stir into it one half 
tablespoonful of flour, and when well mixed stir into the boiling 
soup. Let boil five minutes and serve very hot. 

Brunoise Soup. — Put one quart of soup meat over the fire 
in two quarts of cold water, and bring it slowly to a boil. Skim 
it clear. Peel a carrot, onion and leek, cut in dice, and with a 
little celery, put over the fire to brown with an ounce of butter, 
a teaspoon of powdered sugar, and a quarter of a saltspoon of 
pepper. Take the meat from the soup; put it with the vegetables; 
strain the broth into them. Season with salt. Simmer till meat 
and vegetables are tender. Take out the meat. Serve hot. 

Clam Chcwder. — Brown some pork scraps and three onions 
together until a light brown. Into a large pot put a large layer 
of sliced potato, then a layer of soft clams, sprinkling a little 
salt, pepper, mace, cloves and allspice; then another layer of po- 
tatoes, clams and seasoning. When boiled put on the back part 
of the stove and let simmer ten minutes. Before serving add a 
quart of milk. Let it all boil. Then put in the pork scraps and 
onions and half a tumbler of sherry wine. 



PART III. 
Fish and Oysters. 

Salmon Salad No. 1. — Take one can salmon and the white 
part of a large bunch of celery, chop fine and mix with mayon- 
naise dressing. 

Salmon Salad No. 2. — Yolks of three eggs, half cup cream, 
half cup vinegar, two teaspoonfuls brown sugar, salt, pepper and 
celery seed to taste; let this mixture boil thick like custard, and 
pour over one can of salmon. This dressing makes a splendid 
potato salad. 

Scalloped Lobster. — Line a baking dish with small pieces 
of butter, put in a layer of lobster picked in small pieces. Sprin- 
kle over a little salt, pepper, lemon juice and a layer of bread 
crumbs, repeat having the crumbs on top. Pour over two cups 
of milk and bake half an hour. Serve hot. 

Scalloped Salmon. — Take two cups of milk and when boil- 
ing thicken with a tablespoonful of cornstarch, wet with cold 
milk ; this is for the sauce. Then lay in an earthen dish a layer 
of salmon, sprinkled with salt and pepper; then a layer of cracker 
or bread crumbs, moisten with the sauce, and so on in this way 
fill up the dish, having the last layer of bread crumbs. Put bits 
of butter over the top in a hot oven and bake about twenty min- 
utes. Serve hot. This makes a very nice dish to get up in a hurry 
for unexpected company on a day when the larder is lean. Can- 
ned salmon is as good for the purpose as fresh. 

Baked Halibut. — Have it sliced as for frying ; lay one 
slice in baking pan with a few bits of salt pork (a very few) be- 
neath it to keep it from sticking. On this put a bit or two of 
sweet butter and such seasoning as you like ; be wary of over- 
doing it ; on this place a second piece, treating it the same 
and continue to lay the fish in piles of three slices until all are 
prepared. Moisten occasionally with water until nearly done, 
then pour over it a cup of sweet cream or new milk and serve 
with egg sauce or mock cream for gravy. A nice egg sauce is 
made by taking one pint of milk, beating in one tablespoonful of 



26 THE KELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

farina or cornstarch or common flour, first evenly moistened in a 
little milk ; add two well-beaten eggs and boil five minutes and 
pour over the fish as it lies on the fish-platter or serve apart as 
you choose. 

Boiled Salmon with Sauce. — Slice one onion in boiling 
water, add a little salt, put in three pounds of salmon, with whole 
cloves, allspice, pepper and let them simmer for three quarters of 
an hour ; keep well covered. When done take up with great care 
on a platter ; let drain well. For sauce, put butter size of an egg 
in a frying pan with one tablespoonf ul of flour ; when light 
brown add part of the water the fish has been boiled in until it 
forms a nice gravy ; this should boil up in a few minutes, then 
remove from the fire ; stir in briskly a well -beaten egg, pour the 
gravy over the fish ; set away to cool. This dish should be eaten 
cold. A little cream added to the gravy gives it a nice flavor. 

To Fry Small Fish. — Make two or three deep gashes in 
the fish on each side, and rub salt and pepper over them, even 
into the cuts you have made. Roll in flour or Indian meal, and 
fry in butter or salt pork, tried out. As soon as the fish cleaves 
from the bone, remove to a hot platter, as too much cooking is as 
bad as too little, and this rule is a sure test of the correct cook- 
ing of fish. A tablespoonf ul of fat is enough to use, and will 
brown a spider full of fish well, although from time to time little 
pieces of butter may need to be added to prevent burning. 

Baked Fish. — Dress your fish nicely, salt to taste, and lay 
it out flat in vour nicely greased dripping-pan, leaving the flesh 
side up. Scatter small pieces of butter on the fish, and then 
bake until done — from twenty minutes to half an hour, according 
to the size of fish. Then jDour over the fish a teacupful of sweet 
cream, and return to the oven until nicely browned. A very hot 
oven is required to cook fish in this way. 

Salt Codfish.. — Pare your potatoes, and lay the codfish, 
nicely skinned, on top of them. Boil and serve with a simple 
gravy of flour and water well cooked, seasoned and heavily but- 
tered. For breakfast " pick up " finely what is left, and, in the 
morning, heat over in just water enough to moisten it, butter aud 
pepper it well, and spread like sandwiches on thin slices of bread 
made into eggtoast. Moisten your slices of bread in cold water, 



THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 27 

and milk and lay on a nicely-buttered fry- 
ing-pan over a quick fire; turn bread quickly, spread on your 
fish and serve hot. 

Baked Bass. — Wash well a fresh bass. Wipe dry. Stuff it 
with stuffing as for roast turkey. Then lay it in a dripping-pan. 
Cover the fish with slices of pork; season with salt and pepper. 
Bake in a moderate oven a little over half an hour. Baste occa- 
sionally with a little butter. When done put on a dish and keep 
hot. Make a sauce of the drippings, and adding one tablespoon 
each Worcestershire sauce, walnut catsup, chopped capers and 
parsley. Pour some of this on the dish with the fish, and serve 
the rest in a bowl. 

Fried Filets of Flounder.— Wash the flounder. Wipe it 
dry, and lay it on the table. With a sharp knife cut down to the 
bone in the centre of the fish, from head to tail. Lay the blade 
flat against the bone, and cut outwards toward the fin, and so 
take off the whole filet, without breaking it. Then skin each 
filet carefully. Lay the filet on the bread crumbs and turn till 
completely covered. Beat up one egg with a tablespoon of cold 
water. Dip the filet into the egg, and lay again on the bread. 
Heat enough fat until it begins to smoke. Drop the filets into it. 
Fry them a light brown. Take them up with a skimmer. Serve 
with parsley around them. 

Fish Croquettes. — Remove all the skins and bones from a 
pound of any cold fish. Chop fine, mix with equal parts of 
mashed potatoes, season highly with salt and pepper, and one 
egg; form in small balls, roll in flour and fry brown in boiling 
lard. Serve hot, with walnut pickles. 

Baked Codfish. — Take a cup of codfish picked fine, two 
cups potatoes chopped fine, one beaten egg, half cup butter, 
pepper; mix well and bake half an hour. 

Fried Scallops.— Roll the scallops in cracker dust, then 
dip into the beaten yolk of one egg. Then into the cracker. 
Throw into hot lard, and fry like doughnuts. Dry on brown 
paper. Serve hot, garnished with parsley. 

Clam Pie. — In a deep pie-dish lay a layer of thin-sliced po- 
tatoes, a few pieces of partially cooked onion, a few chopped raw 
clams, pepper and some salt (celery salt, if you like the flavor), 



38 THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

then another thin layer of potatoes, onions and clams, and sea- 
soning until the dish is within an inch or so of being full; then 
pour in a teacupf ul of the clam liquor, and fill up with hot water 
until you can see it coming up between the upper pieces. Sav3 
the remainder of the clam liquor, if there is any left. For crust, 
use any good recipe that gives you invariably a light biscuit; 
mix as usual, mould slightly and spread it with shortening quite 
thickly, sprinkle on some flour, roll up and work it well; then 
roll out till about three-quarters of an inch thick and the size re- 
quired, cut three air holes and lay over the pie. Put in oven ; 
when partly cooked, butter the crust. Heat up your clam liquor 
and add, if the broth has cooked away too much. 

Oyster Pie. — Line a dish with a crisp paste, put in a layer 
of oysters, salt, pepper and butter size of a walnut, half a cup of 
cream, one hard boiled egg sliced, cover with grated bread crumbs, 
put a little butter over them and bake brown. 

Fried Oysters.— Dry them first thoroughly by draining, after- 
ward laying on a napkin, covering with another until all juice i^ 
absorbed. To every quart allow the well-beaten yolks of two 
small eggs ; stir in the oysters until they are covered; grate over 
them a suspicion of nutmeg, if preferred; turn into a dish of 
cracker crumbs, and toss around until well coated. Brown in a 
spider of boiling lard or butter, and salt when done, otherwise 
they will not brown. 

Fried Oysters. — Take fine, large oysters, put in a colander 
and drain off the liquor. Have a beaten egg on one plate and 
cracker dust on another. Lift the oysters, one at a time, with a 
fork, dip first in the egg, then in the cracker dust ; lay them two 
together, makifig them look like one, place them in the palm of 
your hand and pat them together, so that they will not come 
apart ; lay them on a dish until you have them all ready to fry ; 
place on the fire a frying-pan, with a tablespoonful of lard, and 
one of butter in it ; as soon as it is boiling hot, lay in the oys- 
ters ; sprinkle a little salt on them, and fry them a nice brown ; 
when done, lift them out and put them in a colander and set 
them in the oven until wanted ; serve on a warm dish. 

Oyster Sandwich.— Split small fresh crackers, and butter 
the inside, being careful to keep those pieces which belong to- 



THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 29 

gether side by side, as they fit much more neatly. Lay on each 
bottom half, one large, or two small oysters which you have pre- 
viously examined to see that they are free from shell. Season 
with bits of butter, a little salt, and a dash of black pepper ; 
cover with the upper half. Place these prepared crackers in a 
dripping-pan, and bake in a moderate oven from fifteen to twenty- 
five minutes. The cracker must be thoroughly heated through, 
but not in the least burned. Send to the table as soon as taken 
from the oven. These should be served on a hot platter, and 
served with a hot pie-knife. They are very nice to serve in the 
evening with hot coffee or chocolate, and should be accompanied 
by pickles. 

Stewed Oysters. — Set the broth over the fire to come to a 
boil. Mix together over the fire one ounce each of butter and 
flour, until they bubble. Gradually stir this into the broth, and 
season with a teaspoonful of salt, and a-quarter of a saltspoon of 
white pepper. Stir in the yolks of three raw eggs, one at a time, 
and the juice of one lemon. Put the oysters into the sauce. Let 
them heat until the edges begin to curl. Then serve at once. 

Oyster Patties. — Two eggs beaten thoroughly, one teacup 
sweet milk, one teacup raw oysters chopped a little, five milk 
crackers rolled fine, one teaspoon cream tartar, one-half teaspoon 
of soda sifted with two tablespoons of flour, salt and pepper. 
Bake on a griddle as you would griddle cakes. 

Oyster Sandwiches. — Take large stewing oysters, pound 
them in a mortar (having previously cut off their beards) with a 
little cayenne and lemon fjuice. Spread this mixture on thin 
slices of brown bread and butter, cut into rounds the size of a 
silver dollar. 

Oyster Fritters. — Drain off the liquor from two dozen oys- 
ters and put in a sauce-pan, set on the stove. Beat three eggs in 
a cup of cream; add salt, pepper and flour to make a stiff batter, 
add the oyster liquor with the oysters; fry a spoonful at a time, 
dropped in boiling lard. Serve very hot. 

Escalloped Oysters.— Butter your dish, strew with bread or 
cracker crumbs containing the seasoning pepper, salt and butter, 
then a layer of oysters and a little milk, large piece of butter; set 
in a hot oven for half an hour. 



30 THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 

Escalloped Oysters. — Roll one pound of crackers very fine 
and to this add two quarts of oysters, grease an earthen baking 
dish sides and bottom with butter, put a layer of the cracker dust 
and season with butter, salt and pepper and moisten with milk 
warmed with a little boiling water, then a layer of oysters and 
season them a little, then another of crackers, season well as be- 
fore, and so on till the dish is full, put the cracker dust on the 
top, season and moisten well, bake one hour; a little baking 
powder added to the cracker dust will make it lighter. 

Oyster Salad. — Take a dozen and a-half of oysters; scald 
in their own liquor, with the addition of a-half cupful of strong 
vinegar, a pinch of red pepper, a pinch of white pepper and a 
little salt. Drain. When cold, cut the hard part of the oysters 
off and chop fine. Care should be taken not to hurt the appear- 
ance of the soft part of the oyster. Cut a head of celery into 
small dice, scraping the greenish stalks and only wipe off the 
white ones; mix the oysters and celery lightly together, and just 
before they go to the table pour over the following dressing: 

Dressing. — To the yolk of one egg beaten well add slowly, 
drop by drop, a wineglassful of olive oil, a pinch of mustard, salt 
and pepper, dissolved in a teaspoonful of vinegar, added at the 
last. Keep the dish and oil very cold while making. Put on ice 
in a cold place and pour it over the salad just before sending to 
table. 

Fancy Roast Oysters. — Toast your bread, butter the 
slices and lay in a shallow dish. Put the liquor from the oysters 
to heat, add salt and pepper, and just before it boils add the oys- 
ters; let them boil up and pour over bread. 

Pickied Oysters. — Scald the oysters in their own liquor; 
make some vinegar boiling hot, with some whole pepper, allspice, 
mace and a little salt. Take the oysters from their liquor with a 
bowl, and pour the hot vinegar over them. Serve celery with 
them. They are fit to eat as soon as cold. 

Oysters and Macaroni. — Boil a-half pound of macaroni 
until tender. Into a deep earthen dish put a layer of the maca- 
roni, adding small pieces of butter, a little pepper and salt. From 
one pint of oj^sters make alternate layers with the macaroni and 
season each layer as above. When the dish is filled pour over it 



THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 81 

the liquor from the oysters, with quarter of a pint of milk. Bake 
in a hot oven one-half hour, covering the dish with a pan while 
baking, to preserve the flavor of the oysters, but remove it five or 
ten minutes before they are done, and let them brown. Wrap a 
napkin around the dish and serve. 

Devilled Oysters is a dish too highly seasoned to find favor 
with many, but we give the recipe in case some would like to 
try it. Put a layer of raw oysters in a deep pan; then a layer of 
bread crumbs, black and red pepper, salt, butter, mustard and 
vinegar; mix together. Alternate the layers until the pan is 
full. Bake and serve with sliced lemon.

Fried Omelet. — Beat separately the whites and yolks of six 
eggs. Add to the yolks a tablespoonful of milk for each egg, a 
scant teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, and, if liked, two 
or three tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Stir the whites lightly 
into the beaten yolks and turn the whole into a hot skillet into 
which has been melted (care being taken not to let it brown) a 
tablespoonful of butter. During the frying move the skillet to 
and fro, shaking it gently, and if bubbles form prick them. When 
the omelet is nicely browned on the bottom, set it in the oven an 
instant to dry the top ; then fold it over with a cake turner and 
serve at once in a hot platter. If cheese is used, an extra table- 
spoonful may be sprinkled over the top before folding the omelet 
in half. 

Plain Omelet. — Beat six eggs very thoroughly, the yolks to 
a cream and the whites to a stiff froth ; add to this one table- 
spoonful of flour or corn starch mixed smooth in one cup of sweet 
milk, salt and pepper and a piece of butter as large as an English 
walnut ; now pour this on to the white froth and without stirring 
at all pour the whole into a hot, buttered omelet-pan or ordinary 
deep frying-pan. Cook on top of stove or over a brisk fire for 
about five minutes and it will " rise " beautifully ; gently remove 
it to the hot oven and let it brown, and serve hot. 

Baked Omelet, — Six eggs, whites and yolks beaten separate- 
ly. Six tablespoons milk with enough flour stirred in to make a 
batter. Take a cup of milk, put on the stove, stir in the batter,

and a pinch of salt. Take from the stove, pour into a dish to 
cool, then stir in the yolks of the eggs. Beat whites to a stiff froth, 
add, mix well. Bake ten minutes. Eat while hot. Serve from 
the same dish it is baked in.

two small omelets. 

Celery Salad. — Stir briskly the yolk of one egg and sweet 
oil, by drops, until the consistency becomes stiff. Add two table- 
spoonsful of prepared mustard, a pinch of salt and pepper, three

sauce over the celery. 

Tomato Sauce — Cut up fresh tomatoes and stew them in 
their own juice for half an hour, then put in a little onion, salt

PART X. 
Picklfes, Preserves and Confectionery. 

Winter Chili Sauce. — One quart can tomatoes, six large 
onions; cook the onions until tender, pour in tomatoes, three 
teaspoonsful salt, two of cloves .and allspice, and pepper, four 
cups vinegar, one and one-half cups sugar. 

Conserves Peaches. — Weigh the fruit to one pound, use 
one-fourth pound sugar, steam fruit one-fourth hour until you 
can pierce with a straw, the fruit makes its own juice, put on 
dishes, cover with syrup, set in sun to dry, in a day or two turn 
each piece over, when half dry put on clean dishes with the rest 
of syrup and roll in granulated sugar and put in glass jars. 

Damsons. — Put the fruit in stone jars, set in hot water to 
steam; when soft and pulpy pap through a sieve. To one pound 
of fruit use one-fourth pound sugar. Stew till thick, pour on 
dishes not too thick; when nearly dry cut in squares, roll in gran- 
ulated sugar. 

Cherries.— Stone the fruit and scald, using one-fourth pound 
sugar to one pound fruit; then proceed as in peaches. 

Raspberries. — Wash, weigh, stew as damsons, put on dishes 
when nearly dry, cut in squares as for damsons. Any or all fruit 
done in this way equals the French conserves. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Boil the berries till soft, and strain. 
To one pint of juice add one pint of granulated sugar, and boil 
together fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Preserved Watermelon Kind or Citron.— Having pared 
and cut the rind, to each pound allow one and one half pounds 
white sugar, and one pint of water. Heat the syrup sufl&ciently 
to strain easily, return to kettle and put in the rind, after having 
been in salt water, that will bear an egg, for three days, then in 
fresh water all night to remove the salt taste. Boil rapidly till 
nearly done, then more moderately till clear entirely through. If 
the rind is boiled in water without the sugar, it will not be clear 
and sweet all through. No ue. d of alum water, ginger tea, vines, 



THE RELIABLE COOK BOOK. 87 

leaves, etc., only use lemon, vanilla, strawberry, any one flavor- 
ing you like best. 

Currant Jelly.— Put your fruit into a stone jar, which must 
be placed in a pot of hot water, and keep it boiling until your 
currants are easily squeezed. This method sjives less trouble and 
obtains more juice. Measure one pound of sugar to every pint 
of juice and put upon the fire; let it boil for twenty minutes. 
Don't paste up while hot. 

Prune Jelly.— Stew two quarts of prunes slowly until very 
soft. Strain through a colander and save the prunes. Put the 
juice in a kettle and add half a package of gelatine which has 
been dissolved in cold water and a large cupful of sugar, boil fast 
twenty minutes and pour in tumblers. The prunes can be used 
for sauce, by adding a cup of sugar and a little water, and cook- 
ing as usual. 

Stewed Pears.— Put them, well mashed, into a tight vessel, 
with sugar enough to sweeten, and water to keep from burning, 
a little stick cinnamon, or two or three whole cloves. Stew a long 
time. 

Baked Pears.— Prepare as for stewing, but add no spice; 
set your dish in the oven and let it bake till the pears are dark and 
in a rich syrup. 

Peaches. — Soft peaches preserved with the skins on are 
splendid. Open any freestone peaches you may happen to have, 
weigh them, and allow nearly one pound of white sugar to each 
pound of fruit. Place in a dish a layer of peaches and one of 
sugar, alternately, let stand over night, and in the morning boil 
in their own syrup till done. Peaches done in this way keep 
nicely. 

Pumpkin Preserves. — Take a good round ripe pumpkin, 
peel and cut in inch squares, le<^ stand over night in a weak solu- 
tion of alum water, and in the morning spread on platters, set in 
the sun or in the oven for two hours, take three-fourths pound of 
sugar to a pound of pumpkin, one cup raisins and a lemon, cook 
till pumpkin is done, then skim out and cook juice until thick 
enough to keep as any other preserves, if made right can't be told 
from citron.

of tomatoes, add a little water, and boil tender, strain off and 
weigh the juice, add one pound of sugar and one-half lemon to 
each pound of juice. Boil till thick as good molasses and put

Grape Jelly. — Pick the grapes, either green or ripe, from 
the stem; wash and drain them and mash them with a spoon. 
Put them in your preserving kettle and cover them with a plate. 
Boil ten minutes, then pour them into your jelly bag and squeeze 
out the juice. Put back into the kettle, with one pound of sugar 
to every pint of juice, and boil again for twenty minutes, skim- 
ming well. 

Wild Grape Jelly. — Stew wild grapes until soft, then press 
through a flannel jelly bag. Boil juice twenty -five minutes, if a 
bright, clear day, if rainy or cloudy it will take fifteen minutes 
longer, then add sugar at the rate of one teacupful of sugar to 
four teacupfuls of juice, and boil until it jellies, when dropped 
on a cold plate. Place in jelly glasses, and keep in a dry, cool 
cellar. 

Preserved Oranges. — Boil the oranges in clear water until 
you can pass a straw through their skins; then clarify three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, and pour over 
the oranges while hot. Let them stand one night, then boil them 
in the syrup until they are clear and the syrup thick. Take them 
from the syrup, and strain it clear over them. 

Preserved Citron. — Prepare the rind in any form desired, 
boil very hard in tolerably strong alum water for thirty or forty 
minutes, then take out and put into clear, cold water to stand

it looks light and clear. This is delicious, and will keep for 
years as well as foreign sweetmeats. A little ginger root will 
give common apple sauce a most delicious flavor.
