PREFACE. 



The object of this little work is to aid the busy 
practitioner in the selection and administration of the 
medicines he prescribes, and to help him in dispensing — 
an occupation which forms a necessary, often an irksome, 
but seldom an agreeable, part of his daily occupation. 

Formularies or Pharmacopoeias more or less 
complete are employed in all the London and Pro- 
vincial Hospitals, Dispensaries, and Infirmaries. They 
are compiled with reference to the special requirements 
of the Institutions in which they are employed, and 
are designed to economise not only materials but 
also the time and labour of the medical officers and 
dispensers, and thereby to facilitate materially the 
work of the Institution. Stock Medicines, e.g., Con- 
centrated Mixtures and Solutions and Pills, prepared 
according to adopted formulae, are commonly employed 
with the same object in private practice. But as far as I 
am aware there has been no attempt to compile a For- 
mulary adapted to the modern requirements of General 
Practice, with a view to supersede as far as possible 
extemporaneous dispensing, and to embrace all the im- 
provements and elegancies of modem pharmacy. The 



viii PREFACE. 

present work has been undertaken with a view to supply- 
such a Formulary. The practitioner will select those 
adapted to his individual requirements, and these he 
may obtain ready for use, and so save himself the 
trouble of preparation. The formulae are all reliable, 
none having been admitted unless sanctioned by good 
authority or tested by my own experience, — they are 
sufficiently comprehensive to supply a medicine for all 
ordinary cases, and as most of the remedies have the 
advantage of extreme portability, those most commonly 
required can without inconvenience accompany him on 
his rounds, and be at once dispensed — an obvious 
advantage to himself and his patients. This is more 
practicable now than heretofore, because the medicinal 
requirements of modem practice are encompassed 
within much narrower limits, and the practitioner 
may, with much advantage, dispense with the cum- 
brous and complicated appliances which were formerly 
necessary to the pharmacy of general practice. I solicit 
my confreres to apprise me of any inaccuracies or omis- 
sions that may come imder their notice, and I shall 
be glad to receive any suggestions tending to promote 
the usefulness of future editions.

INTRODUCTION. 



GUTT^ (Drops). — When,for the sakeof portability orother- 
wise, fluid concentrated preparations are needed, a definite 
number of DROPS may be ordered to be taken in water ; but for 
general purposes it is better to adopt the teaspoonful dose in 
a wineglassful of water, and to regulate the proportions of the 
active ingredients accordingly. This method is both prac- 
ticable and convenient, and is especially applicable to the 
administration of the dilute mineral acids, tinctures, e.g., 
tincture aconite, tincture veratrum viride, etc., expressed 
juices, elixirs, and some of the liquors. The dose may be de- 
termined with precision, as vials graduated for 4, 6, 8, and 12 
teaspoons may be obtained at the medical glass warehouses. 

MiSTUR^ (Mixtures).— For the administration of some 
medicines this form is indispensable, but that described above 
may, with advantage, be substituted for many which are con- 
stantly prescribed in mixtures, more from the force of habit 
and custom than from necessity. The drugs which necessarily 
are given in this form are those which are sparingly soluble, or 
require to be freely diluted. The Salts of Magnesia, Soda, and 
Potash, are of this kind, and Infusions, Decoctions, and other 
such like medicaments are to be given in this form. Mixtures 
are largely employed in Hospital Practice, partly, I believe, 
to humour a popular prejudice in their favour. Out-patients 
especially expect their medicine in a fluid form. It satisfies 
the patient. A large bottle of medicine they think is some- 
thing costly, obtained cheaply, and rewards them for the 
time and labour bestowed in the getting. More costly medi- 
cine in a less bulky form would not find so much favour in their 
eyes. The same silly prejudice exists among parish and club 
patients to the serious inconvenience of the practitioner, who 
is obliged to study the man as well as the patient. Many 
practitioners use simple concentrated mixtures, while, for the 
sake of convenience and economy, they depend chiefly upon 
the pilular form for the essential part of their medicinal 
treatment. 

The Hospital Pharmacopoeias give numerous formulas for 
mixtures, and considerable confusion is occasioned by the 
same names representing different medicines at different 
hospitals. In some instances the variations of materials or 
quantities are very trifling, in others they are very material. 
At page 51, will be found the formulae of those most in common 
use at the hospitals. They are not identical with any, while 



INTRODUCTION. 



they are typical of all. These formulae might be largely 
extended, but those given are sufficient for general purposes. 

PiLULiE. — It is convenient to divide this form into pills, 
pilules, and granules ; pilule being used as a diminutive to 
denote a small pill ; granules, or grains, being pilules not 
exceeding a grain in weight. Some parents w^ho would 
object to pills, willingly give their children granules. 

Of all forms of medicines this is now the most convenient 
to the practitioner, and generally the most popular with his 
patients. The manufacture of medicines in this form has 
received considerable attention, and is a distinct brattch of 
pharmacy. Pill making has always been regarded by the 
practitioner as the most unpleasant part of his necessary 
dispensing. Now they can be obtained ready made, and 
better made than it is possible to prepare them extempora- 
neously ; hence they offer to him the most convenient mode 
of supplying his patients with remedies. 

Glycecols, a new form which I have devised for admi- 
nistering medicines, are fully described at page 64. They 
supply an effective and elegant, as well as convenient, mode 
of applying certain remedies locally to the throat, often super- 
seding the necessity of using gargles, and are an attractive 
medium for administering powders to children. 

Spray. — Medicated fluids, atomised by means ot spray 
tubes, may be most advantageously applied in affections of 
the lungs, trachea, mouth, and fauces. In croup, diphtheria, 
and inflammations of the air passages, they are employed 
with great advantage. Drugs suitable for this form of ad- 
ministration are named at page 106. 

Hypodermic Injection. — Solutions of Morphia, Atro- 
pine, and Aconitine are employed in this form with advantage 
in cases of advanced Cancer, Tetanus, Rheumatism, Neu- 
ralgia, etc. Formulas for those commonly employed are 
given at page 112. 

MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN. 

It is exceedingly desirable that medicines for children 
should be prepared palatable, and, if possible, tasteless. 
To this end I have endeavoured to supply formulae 
adapted to the treatment of all the diseases of childhood. 



INTRODUCTION. 



The Pilular and Glycecol forms are the best for this 
purpose. In the pill form they may be prepared so small 
and attractive looking for infants and young children 
that the nurse or parent can administer them without the 
knowledge of the patient, if very young, and readily with the 
consent of those who are older (as they can be made quite 
tasteless), without resorting to arts of deception and false 
assurances so commonly practised and so quickly detected. 
Induced to taste and try, a child's confidence is soon ob- 
tained, and opposition ceases when the medicine is found to 
be tasteless or tolerably palatable. 

When powders are necessary, the Glycecol offers an ad- 
mirable medium for administering them to children, especially 
to infants and those too young to be educated to swallow 
granules.- The reader will find a number of formulae pre- 
pared in this manner, in all of which the taste of the medicine 
is well concealed. It is both cruel and unnecessary to give 
nauseous medicines to children. Under the head of Mistura 
also several formulae will be found, which have been specially 
devised to meet the ordinary requirements of diseases com- 
mon to childhood. 

REMARKS ON A READY METHOD OF 
DISPENSING MEDICINES. 

As long ago as 1866 I suggested a method of dispensing, 
by means of Portable Miniature Dispensaries and Ready 
Remedies. It consisted essentially in this — 

1st. That the practitioner should adopt a Formulary of 
'Remedies adapted to the requirements of his own practice, 
and keep these medicines in a state of readiness to administer, 
' rather than in a crude state, which necessitates pharmaceu- 
tical manipulation, involving time and labour, before they 
can be dispensed to his patients ; and with this object the 
present Formulary was in part compiled. 

2nd. By means of a Miniature Dispensary, which is simply 
a box or case (divided into many compartments, each being 
fitted with a suitable tube or bottle), in which is carried a 
sufficiently comprehensive selection of the adopted formulae 
to answer all the ordinary indications for medicinal treatment. 

This method has been found to greatly conduce to the 
convenience of the practitioner and the comfort and benefit 
of his patients, and the present work is offered as an aid to 



INTRODUCTION. 



its more general adoption ; in it the formulas are more 
numerous, and many of them have been selected with special 
reference to this method of administration. 

Among the many advantages which the adoption of this 
method offers, the most important is that it enables the prac- 
titioner to supply most of the medicinal requirements of his 
patients at the time they are seen, whether it be by the bed- 
side far off, or in his own consulting room at home. And 
only those who are actively engaged in general practice can 
appreciate how great a desideratum this is, and what relief 
it affords him in his work. To return home from a long 
round, with all, or nearly all his patients supplied with 
medicine, and to be spared the toil of recalling the particular 
requirements of each, and the labour of dispensing for all, is 
a boon which is worth taking some pains to secure. More- 
over, patients invariably appreciate very highly the prompt 
manner in which these Ready Remedies are supplied. 
However opinions may differ as to the power of drugs to 
cure disease, there is no doubt as to their power to alleviate 
pain and suffering, and the value of the visit is greatly 
enhanced when present distress is relieved at once. Practi- 
tioners often visit patients miles from their home, taking no 
medicine with them, so that the patient after waiting, it may 
be, many hours for the doctor, has to submit to the further 
delay and inconvenience of sending to his surgery for the 
remedy, however urgently needed — it may be a styptic to 
arrest haemorrhage which threatens life, or a narcotic to 
relieve intolerable suffering. 

This ready method necessitates, of course, some change in 
the mode of prescribing, which at the commencement 
demands, to a certain extent, some thought and painstaking, 
but the result amply rewards the trouble taken. 

PILL COATING. 

The value of the pilular form of administering medicines 
has been immensely increased, and its general applicability 
extended by the process of coating or enamelling, now so 
popular. Properly done it effectually protects the pills from 
atmospheric influence, and preserves the medicament in a 
fresh and moderately moist conditiott, ensuring its activity for 
a considerable length of time. Moreover it conceals the taste 
of the drug and gives the pill a pleasant appearance in place of 



INTRODUCTION. 



a repulsive one, thereby making them acceptable to those who 
otherwise could not be induced to take them. The materials 
employed, French Chalk and Gums in aqueous or alcoholic 
solutions, are perfectly harmless, and cannot possibly exert a 
deleterious effect of any kind. The secret of successful 
coating is to be sought in the manner in which these are 
put on, in other words in the process of manufacture. It is 
a very simple matter indeed to moisten a pill with mucilage, 
roll it about in French Chalk until it assumes a white pearly 
appearance, and to call it coated. Such a coating, which is 
used by some makers, is not permanent, but quickly perish- 
able ; its inexpensiveness, however, is its chief attraction to 
some, and its demerits are covered by a confident assurance 
of its immediate solubility. Every practitioner knows full 
well that there are some conditions in which pills, like other 
substances, meat, fruit, etc., are hurried through the bowels 
unchanged, and this is an accident dependent more on the 
condition of the patient than on the substance ingested. The 
most absurd tests of solubility are constantly put forth, and 
are calculated to mislead the judgment of the purchaser. 
It is quite possible for a coating to wash off in cold water in 
a few moments, and yet the pill itself to be quite in- 
operative. The conditions which govern solubility in the 
stomach are not exactly comparable with those of cold water 
in a tumbler. Temperature and the solvent powers of the 
secretions have to be taken slightly into account, and in this 
matter the proof of the value of a coated piU must be judged 
like the cook's pudding. The coating may be made a cloak 
for defective manufacture. Much more important than the 
coating is the quality of the pill itself; it should be tested 
by its degree of hardness, its uniform consistence, and, if ne- 
cessary, by chemical and microscopical examination. The 
ancient process of coating with GoLD OR Silver Leaf has 
recently been revived. It is very elegant, but costly, and 
not so effective a preservative as other materials. 

Sugar Coating. — This process, which is similar to that 
used in comfit making, necessarily enlarges the pills, but 
the chief objection is that they must be dried and exposed 
to considerable heat, thereby impairing the quality of the 
ingredients, and rendering the pill insoluble by depriving it 
of moisture.

Calomel, although not so largely employed as formerly, is still 
held to be a most valuable antiphlogistic in inflammatory and febrile 
affections — a sheet anchor in the treatment of inflammation of 
membranes, especially serous membranes, peritonitis, pleurisy, peri- 
carditis, also in inflammation of the tissue of the eye, and iritis. 
Opium promotes its antiphlogistic powers, and prevents its acting 
on the bowels. However this combinption be employed, whether as 
a sedative or to produce ptyalism, one or other of the following six 
formulas will conveniently meet the requirements of most cases.

Chlorate of Potash in its therapeutic action resembles that of 
Nitre in being refrigerant and diuretic ; but it has also a special 
action of its own on the mucous membrane and is not depressant. 
Indeed, it is believed by many to be a restorative, acting by giving up 
Hs large supply of oxygen to the blood. It is, therefore, to be pre- 
"^rred in low fevers, scarlatina, typhus, etc. The Aconite gives to 
this remedy sedative and diaphoretic properties. It will be found 
highly useful in low forms of inflammation, sore throat, sub-acute 
rheumatism, etc. 

Dose — One pill frequently repeated every three or four hours until 
the effect of the aconite is produced.

Aloes et Atropise. 

{Dr. Macario; Pil. Antistyptic No. i. ) 
p. Ext. Aloes Soc, 5 centigrammes; Ferri Sulph., 10 centi- 
grammes ; Atropine, | of a milligramme. 
In a communication to the Lyo.n Medical, Dr. Macario, of Nice, 
observes, that ' ' in treating constipation most practitioners confine 
themselves to enemata, laxatives, or more or less irritating purga- 
tives, which do more harm than good," and wishes to make known 
a remedy which he says may be truly termed "heroic," one which 
he has employed during twelve years with constant success, and 
therefore regards as infallible. 

He refers particularly to two common forms of Constipation : 
1st. Nervous, produced by intestinal excitement, with deficient 
secretion. 2nd. Atonic, produced by deficient contraction of the 



42 PILULAi. 

muscular coat of the intestine, which bad anti-hygienic habits have 
induced to keep up. 

For nervous constipation he recommends the above pill. 

In the atonic form, one centigramme of powdered Nux Vomica 
is substituted for the Atropine. 

By the aid of these pills, regular stools may be procured, even in 
obstinate constipation, dependent on cerebral disturbance, para- 
plegia, etc. 

Dr. Macario gives from one to three of these pills immediately 
after dinner, the object being to produce an easy, natural, non- 
diarrhoeic evacuation. The use of these " Atttistyptk'^ pills should 
not be continued indefinitely without an interval, it being of import- 
ance to allow the organs to resume their spontaneous action without 
any auxiliary. 

{170.) 

Aloes et Nucis Vomicae. 

{Dr. Maca7-io; Fil. Antistyptic No. 2. ) 

The same as above, with i centigramme of powdered Nux 
Vomica in place of the Atropine. 

For other re7nedies for habitual constipation, see F. 118, 131, 132, 168. 
(171.) 

Aloetic Granules. 

Containing simply one grain of pure Aqueous Extract of Aloes, 
free from resin. 

"Few medicines," says Dr. West, "act more mildly or more 
certainly in children than Aloes." The bitterness and bulkiness of 
the decoction and powder oppose great difficulty to its administra- 
tion to young children. Castor Oil, Senna, and Jalap, for a like 
reason, and also on account of the nausea and griping which they 
occasion, are frequently inadmissible. While the habitual use of 
calomel and grey powder, simply to overcome constipation, is highly 
injurious. These granules, prepared with the finest aloes that can 
be obtained, will be found by far the most efficient and convenient 
aperient that can be devised for young children ; they may be given 
at all ages, and are especially useful in the treatment of those 
obstinate forms of constipation which so often occur in infancy. In 
every case where a mercurial \s, not indicated, they may be employed 
with great advantage. Being perfectly tasteless there is no difficulty 
in giving them whole or in parts in a sweet preserve, to chil- 
dren who are too young to be taught to swallow them. In adults

who suffer simply from sluggish bowels, one granule taken daily 
with dinner secures comfortable relief.

Nux Vomica Granules. 

These are prepared with the Alcoholic Extract, half a grain in 
each, in such a manner as to ensure immediate solution and 
diffusion over the mucous coat of the stomach. 
Dose — One granule three times a day with meals. 
Use — In constipation depending upon want of tone and imperfect 
propelling power of the colon, Nux Vomica, either alone or com- 
bined, is a very efficient remedy. Besides its action on the muscular 
coat of the bowel, it is a direct stimulant to the spinal cord, it acts 
directly on the mucous coat of the stomach ; it increases appetite, 
promotes digestion, as well as aids the proper unloading of the 
bowels. In headaches, especially congestive headaches, morning 
sickness in pregnancy, in depression consequent upon over stimula- 
tion, it is very valuable. In gastralgia, pyrosis, chronic catarrh of 
the stomach, and dyspepsia, attended with coated tongue, flatulence, 
acidity, heartburn, the simple Nux Vomica Granules will afford 
considerable relief. One may be taken half an hour before meals, 
two or three times a day.

Phosphorus and Nux Vomica, combined in the proportions

admirably adapted for the treatment of a large number of nervous

in the diseases of childhood. It increases appetite and promotes 
digestion. It may be safely given in all those cases in which the 
hypophosphites are employed with advantage.

the digestive organs, and strengthening and improving the condition

Dose — One or two pilules three times a day with food. 

Ferrum Redactum is a powerful hsematinic even in small doses, 
and is well adapted to promote the blood-restoring properties of the 
metal. The absence of astringency renders it peculiarly useful in 
the treatment of diseases depending on poverty of blood, in which 
other preparations of iron would not be admissible. It is more 
than probable that in every case where iron is wanting phos- 
phorus is also deficient, and it is only reasonable to believe that 
where the red globules are reduced one-third or one-half, and the 
liquor sanguinis is poor in albumen (which is commonly the case in 
ancemic conditions), the normal proportion of phosphorus is of 
necessity much below the healthy standard. The combination, 
therefore, is a highly useful one.

overwork and mental fatigue. Phosphorus and Nux Vomica are 
probably the only medicines which can be relied upon as sexual 
stimulants or possess real aphrodisiac power. Their administration, 
however, with this view requires caution : large doses are neither 
necessary or desirable nor should they be long continued without 
intermission ; one or two pills twice or three times a day, according 
to the circumstances of the case, may safely be prescribed for two or 
three weeks in succession with advantage. In cases of impotence 
occurring in old and debilitated subjects gr. j'j, or even gr. -j'j, of 
Phosphorus, either alone or in combination with Quinine and Nux 
Vomica, may be administered with the best results. But after 
success has been attained, the remedy should be left off for a time. *

Pil. Phosphor! c. Ferro. 

Jo Phosphori Pur., -^^ gr.; Ferri Redacti, 3 gr. M. ft. pil. 

Phosphorus and Iron is a powerful nutritive tonic and blood 
restorer. It is especially valuable in xaBERCULAR diseases, con- 
sumption, tabes mesenterica, scrofula, and the strumous diseases and 
cachetic conditions of children. It is given with great advantage 
in ancemia, chlorosis, in sciatica and other neuralgic affections; also 
in furuncular inflammations, carbuncles, boils, etc. 

Dose — For adults, one or two twice or three times a day with food. 
For children between 7 and 12 years of age, one twice or thrice 
daily with food. 

See F. 163.

The uses of Iron and Quinine in combination are too well known

action, while it imparts additional power by supplying nutrition to 
the nervous system.

so PlLULyE. 

This is a valuable and highly efficient combination. It will be 
found most efficacious in that numerous class of cases characterized 
by imJDoverished blood and loss of nerve power, and in which Iron 
and Phosphorus are both strongly indicated. It must be obvious 
that this preparation admirably fulfils the purposes for which these 
powerful therapeutic agents are prescribed. It will be found more 
effectual than the hypophosphites in syrups, and other feeble modes 
of exhibiting Phosphorus. 

It is unnecessary to particularize every disease in which this 
formula is useful. There can be no doubt that these powerful 
remedies act together in a special manner, and answer diffisrent in- 
dications more fully than when administered separately. 

In many cases this form may be substituted for F. 194 or 192. 

Dose—On^ or two twice or three times a day with food.

In phthisis when accompanied with hysterical irritability and 
troublesome cough with little febrile disturbance it both soothes and 
supports. 

This and the two following preparations are suggested as being 
well adapted for the treatment of phthisis. They are recommended 
in all those stages in which the Hypophosphites* have proved useful, 
as far more efficient and reliable remedies. They may be given 
advantageously during a course of cod-liver oil. I have seen 
cases in which marked improvement has resulted. Formulae 193 and 
195 are also frequently prescribed for this purpose. 

Dose—Ont, twice' or thrice daily, or two at bedtime.

MISTUR-SJ. 

The following formulae are so framed that, with a trifling modifi- 
cation, the Mixtures may be concentrated, and in this form kept 
ready for use, a matter of interest to those who desire to curtail 
the labour of dispensing. They correspond to Mixtures in constant 
use at the London Hospitals, and will be found to supply the 
ordinary requirements of practice. In many cases they will be 
found useful as bases, additions being made to them to suit individual 
wants.

This combination is an improvement on the "Red Mixture" of 
the hospitals. It is an elegant and convenient mode of administer- 
ing a bulky and nauseous medicine. As a refrigerant cathartic, 
Sulphate of Magnesia is perhaps more generally employed than any 
other of its class. It operates mildly yet effectually, both by 
augmenting the secretions and by increasing peristaltic action ; and 
there are but few cases in which it is indicated that this mixture 
may not be given with benefit. Generally, it is useful in all febrile, 
congestive, and inflammatory affections. Particularly it is beneficial 
in haemorrhage during and after abortion, haemoptysis, menorrhagia, 
and epistaxis. Gallic Acid (gr. x. doses) may be added in severe 
cases.

the formerit makes the well-known brown mixture, Soda c. Rheo, of

tion, the dose of Antimony should be increased either by adding more

Antimony to the Mixture, or by prescribing it in pills of the required 
strength to be taken with each dose. When on the contrary, in cases 
of feeble circulation, with cold skin, it is desired to stimulate the 
heart's action and to excite the nervous system, pills containing 
Hydrochlorate or Carbonate of Ammonia may most advantageously 
supplement each dose of the mixture. To produce sweating it 
may be desirable to prescribe simple Dover's Powder (Glycecols

S8 ELIXIRS. 



ELIXIRS. 

A popular form of medicine largely employed in the United States, 
being exceedingly pleasant to the taste, and at the same time pos- 
sessing considerable medicinal value. The following are selected 
from formulae recommended by the committee of the College of 
Pharmacy of Philadelphia. 

The simple elixir contained in the following formulae is a pre- 
paration containing cinnamon, orange, and other flavouring ingredi- 
ents, which being sweetened, effectually disguises the taste of the 
medicines. They contain a good portion of Alcohol, which may ac- 
count in a measure for their popularity.

food, improves digestion, increases the strength, removes the pallor 
of debility, and gives firmness arid precision to the action of the 
nervous system, with power to endure fatigue and resist disease. 
One fluid dram contains one grain of Iron Salt and the active 
principles of nearly 10 grains of Bark.

The freedom from all unpleasant taste, and the ease with which 
this pi-eparation is borne by even the most delicate, together with its 
ready assimilation with the food, and consequent rapid absorption, 
render this preparation specially valuable. It is used with benefit 
in those cases where a nervous tonic is indicated. One fluid dram 
contains i grain of Iron Salt. 

Elixir Iron and Gentian.

tion with Iron form one of the most agreeable and effectual pre- 
parations extant. One fluid dram contains I grain of Iron Salt. 



TROCHISCI. 

The following formulae merit particular attention. They are found 
to be exceedingly useful remedies, and are largely employed at the 
Throat Hospital. 

Trochisci Acidi Benzcici. T.H. 

Benzoic Acid, in powder, 175 grains in 350 = | gr. in each. 

Dose — One lozenge every four hours ; if used as a voice lozenge, 
one should be taken a quarter of an hour before using the voice. 

Use — A most valuable stimulant and "voice lozenge" in cases of 
nervo-muscular weakness of the throat. 

Trochisci Acidi Carbolici. T.H. 

Pure Carbolic Acid, 350 grains in 350 = i gr. in each. 
Dose — One lozenge four or five times daily. 
Use — Antiseptic and stimulant. 

Trochisci Acidi Tannici. T.H. \\ gr. each. 

Dose — One lozenge eveiy three or four hours. 

Use — Strongly astringent. 

The officinal preparation contains gr. \ of the acid in each lozenge. 



6o TROCHISCT 

TrocMsci Catechu. T.H. 

Extract of Catechu, 700 grains in 350=2 gr. in each. 
Dose — One lozenge every three hours. 
Use — Astringent, but less powerful than the Tannic Acid. 
B.P., gr. I in each. 

TrocMsci Cubebae. T.H. 

Pulv. Cubebae, 200 grains in 400= J gr. in each. 

Dose — One every three or four hours. 

Use — Very serviceable in diminishing excessive secretions of 
mucus from pharynx, larynx, or trachea. An improvement on 
•' Brown Bronchial Troches." 

TrocMsci Guaiaci. T.H. 

Contain of Guaiacum, 2 gr. in each. 

Dose — One lozenge every two hours in acute inflammations, three 
times a day in chronic affections. 

Use — A specific for arresting crescent inflammation of the tonsils, 
and useful in acute and subacute inflammation of the pharynx, and in 
acute follicular disease of the tonsils, etc., etc. 

TrocMsci Kino. T.H. 

Contains pure extract of Kino, 2 gr. in each. 

Dose — One lozenge every three or four hours. 

Use — Astringent ; rather less powerful than rhatany, and never 
likely to constipate. 

TrocMsci Krameriae. T.H. 

Contains pure extract of Rhatany, 3 gr. in each. 

Dose — One lozenge every three or four hours. 

Use — A very useful astringent. Rhatany is not so likely to dis- 
agree with the stomach as kino, catechu, and other astringents, nor 
does it often produce constipation. 



TROCHISCI. 6 1 



Trochisci Morphise. B.P. 

Each lozenge contains jV gr. Hydrochlorate of Morphia. 
Dose — One lozenge every three or four hours.

Chlorate of Potash, in powder, 1050 grains 350 = 3 gr. in each. 

Dose — One lozenge every three or four hours. 

Use — Stimulant and antiseptic. Useful in thrush and aphthous 
ulcerations, and as a general tonic to the mucous surface. 

B.P., gr. 5 in each. 

The above, together with many other for mulce, will be found in the 
list of Glycecols, and in that form they are certainly much more efficient.

alcoholic Tinctures of the same drugs. 



Tinctura Guaiaci Ether ea (American Form). 

9j Guaiaci Resinae, '^\\y, Sp. Ether. Nit., Oj. vel q.s. Treat 
by displacement until Oj. of the Tincture is obtained. 

Guaiacum has long been a favourite remedy as a stimulating 
diaphoretic in chronic rheumatism, "cold" rheumatic pains, 
sciatica, etc., occurring in persons advanced in life. This pre- 
paration unites with it a diuretic action, and it is in some cases to 
be preferred to the Ammoniated Tincture. In dysmenorrhoea, 
amenorrhoea, and other uterine affections, it has been found very 
useful. 

Dose — jss. to 3ij. diluted. 



Tinctura Opii Ether ea (American Form). 

{^Asiatic Cholera Mixture). 

9> Opii, Camphorge, aa 5j. ; Ol. Caryophylli, f 5j. ; Capsici, 
5j. ; Sp. Ether. Co. (Hoffmann's Anodyne), Oj. M. ft. Tinct. 

Adult Dose — 20 to 60 drops every third or fourth hour, according 
to circumstances. The diffusible character of the Ether is admirably 
adapted to heighten the effects of the important remedies it contains. 

This preparation is a new remedy in this country, but it has been 
extensively employed in America. The formula is sufficient to indi- 
cate its value and the class of cases for which it is specially suited. 
In cases where it is desired to obtain an immediate effect, it is 
invaluable. When cholera is epidemic every practitioner will do 
well to arm himself with this remedy. It will enable him to arrest 
premonitory diarrhoea directly he is called in, and in that manner 
prevent a state of collapse, in which medicine appears so power- 
less.

Tinctura Veratri Viridis. XJ. S. P. 

9) Veratri Viridis, S^iij* J percolate with Sp. Vini Rect. to

Cardiac Depressant and Sedative, used "to control the vascular 
system in cases of inflammatory diseases, especially rheumatic 
fever and gout. Depression and slowness of pulse appear to be 
characteristic symptoms of its action." — Dr. Garrod. 

It is but little used in this country, but is highly esteemed in 
America in the treatment of pneumonia. It is said to be capable of 
rendering the pulse as low as thirty-five beats in a minute. I 
believe it to be largely employed in homoeopathic practice, and with 
great success. It is not poisonous in the degree that Aconite is, 
and may therefore be more fearlessly used. 

Dose — n V. ad nt. xv. 

N.B. — This tincture is more than double the strength of that of 
the British Pharmacopoeia.

GLYCECOLS. 

This is a new and highly convenient vehicle for administering 
medicines, in the form of a troche or lozenge, but differing widely 
from it in its physical characters, composition, and mode of manu- 
facture. The basis is a compound of Glycerine and Isinglass,* 
Glycecolloid, possessing powerful solvent and antiseptic properties 
admirably adapted for the preservation and administration of medi- 
cinal substances. 

The remarkable antiseptic and solvent power of the glycerine, 
together with its bland taste, its unchangeableness, and its neutral 
relation to the animal tissues, render it the most valuable excipient 
that can be used, especially for those medicines which it dissolves 
more readily than water, and gives to this form of medicine a utility 
and importance which it hitherto has not possessed. 

Troches so prepared I propose to call Glycecols, in order to 
distinguish them from the lozenge of the confectioner, and I claim 
for them not only all the advantages which belong to that form of 
medicine as a means of local medication, and as an agreeable mode 
of administering certain medicines to children, but also the additional 
value derived from the properties of the Glycerine, as a therapeutic 
agent as well as an excipient. 

The officinal troche is only nominally a pharmaceutical pre- 
paration, and its neglect as a form of medicine is doubtless due to 
the fact that its manufacture is in the hands of the confectioner ; for 
although formulae for their preparation appear in the Pharmacopoeia, 
the pharmacist has no uniform and recognised practical method nor 
convenient mechanical appliances for dispensing medicines in this 
form with that expedition, accuracy, and neatness which pertain to 
pills, mixtures, or powders. Moreover the bases employed, viz. : — 
mixtures of gum and sugar, fruit paste, etc., are only suitable 

* For some purposes the Glycecolloid is made with fine Gelatine prepared from 
calves' feet only.

excipients for comparatively few medicines, and being identical with 
those used in making the ordinary lozenge of commerce, the 
character of the medicated lozenge in no way differs from those sold 
in the shops as sweetmeats. These are grave objections and 
positive hindrances to their general employment in medicine, and it 
cannot be a matter of surprise that they are seldom prescribed by 
physicians, and for obvious reasons never used in general practice. 

Glycecols are vastly superior to lozenges inasmuch as the utility 
of the latter is, at best, very limited in its application, whereas the 
Glycecol possesses properties which peculiarly adapt it for the 
general administration of medicines. It supplies a medium for 
administering a.c\\ve. Jluid medicines in a solid form while virtually 
in solution, having a range of utility as unlimited as that of the 
pilular form ; it possesses the same advantages of concentration and 
portability, is more active because more quickly absorbed, is more 
easily dispensed, and is by far the most agreeable form of medicine 
which has hitherto been devised. 

Another advantage which may fairly be claimed for the Glycecol 
over the ordinary hard lozenge, when employed in diseases of the 
mouth, tonsils, and throat, is its soft and jelly-like character, a 
valuable quality when the mucous membrane is inflamed. Being 
also free from sugar it is not liable to disorder the stomach, or 
induce nausea and loss of appetite, which is the usual effect of the 
common lozenge when frequently repeated, — and in throat affections 
frequent applications are necessary. 

As a medium for administering medicine to children, Glycecols 
possess peculiar advantages which cannot be claimed for any other 
form ; in most cases the taste of the medicine may be completely 
disguised, and even where nauseous substances are unavoidable, 
their objectionable flavour is materially lessened. They are attrac- 
tive in appearance, infinitely more pleasant than any other vehicle, 
and are easily given to children too young to take the same 
medicines in the pilular form, and who invariably rebel against 
powders, which of all forms of medicine are the most nauseous. 
A Glycecol is a handsome and attractive looking lozenge, weighing 
from forty to sixty grains, lenticular in form, and about the size of a 
shilling, having the consistence of a firm jelly. When carrying a 
material soluble in Glycerine — Morphia for example — it is brilliantly 
transparent; in other cases, such as Guaiacum, it is opalescent; 
Bismuth and other insoluble substances, opaque. It will be ob- 
served that the active ingredients are more diluted than in the com- 
mon lozenge, hence their complete diffusion and rapid absorption. 

The following formulai include the ofificinal troches and also those 
used in the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat, They may be much

extended, but the examples given are quite sufficient to indicate how 
almost universal is the application of this new vehicle. 

MODE OF ADMINISTRATION. 

When employed to produce a local effect the Glycecol 
should be placed upon the tongue and allowed to dissolve slowly ; it 
can then be diffused over the part affected in the form of a liquid 
jelly. The time required for a Glycecol to dissolve is from four to 
five minutes, and as it is desirable to keep the medicament in 
contact with the part affected as long as possible this process should 
not be hurried. In severe cases of sore throat it is advantageous in 
order to remove any mucus or obnoxious secretion, that the mouth 
and throat should be first rinsed out vdth tepid water, to which, in 
most cases, a few drops of Condy's Fluid may be added. 

When used as a vehicle for medicines designed to affect 
the system generally, the Glycecol as soon as it becomes softened, 
may be swallowed whole, before any flavour but that of glycerine is 
apparent. 

When administered to children. Glycecols may be given 
as above, or if the child be too young to be instructed, as in the case 
of infants, it should be placed in a silver teaspoon and held for a few 
minutes over a cup of hot water, and when dissolved shovdd be 
given in a liquid state while yet warm, but on no account hot. 



Glycecol Aconiti.* 

P> Tinct. Aconiti, B.P., inxij. ; Glycerinoe, f5ij. ; Glycecol- 
loidae, 5vj. M. ft. glycecol. xij. 

Useful in painful affections of the pharynx ; in phthisis they 
diminish expectoration and lessen the frequency of the pulse. Act as 
a sedative in irritative coughs. Dose, one every two hours. N.B. — 
Frequently repeated they produce constitutional effects. 



* Eh". Ringer (" Handbook of Therapeutics," page 311) says, — " Of all the 
drugs we possess there are certainly none more valuable than Aconite. Its 
virtues are only beginning to be appreciated. ... Its power over inflamma- 
tion is little less than marvellous." In the early stages of acute inflammation, 
in pericorditis, pleurisy, pneumonia, tonsillitis, catarrh, rheumatism, and to 
relieve pa?n in neuralgia, nervous palpitation of the heart, etc., the preparations 
chosen will answer every purpose. For exhibiting minute doses, the Glycecol, 
Granules, or Tincture, are to be preferred. 

Dr. JliNGER prefers small doses often repeated ; thus half a drop or a drop in 
ateaspoonful of water every ten minutes or quarter of an hour for two hours, and 
afterwards every hour. The Glycecols are admirably adapted for this purpose.

curative and as a prophylactic measure. 

It is well to bear in mind that Belladonna increases the pulse in force, 
frequency, and fulness (J. Harley) ; it is therefore a stimulant to the Hrterial 
system. Children bear large doses better than adults The action of Bella- 
donna should in any case be carefully watched, and its use be discontinued on

POTUS. 
Refrigerant and Saline Drinks. 

In the treatment of many acute diseases, and especially in fevers 
of the eruptive class, It is desirable to exhibit Salines and Refrigerant 
Medicines in a fluid form. The Mineral Acids, and Salts of Potash, 
Magnesia, and Soda, are all useful, and are constantly prescribed. 
When it is not convenient to administer them in the form of a mixture, 
I order them in the household form of a drink, which I find patients, 
especially little ones, take more willingly than " regular physic " ; 
there is no difficulty in getting them quickly and well prepared. 
Medicine in this form, supplemented by Glycecols, Granules, or 
Pills, efficiently supplies the requirements of most cases. It is to be 
remembered that the best and most effective refrigerant is cold or 
iced water. 

Potus Acidi Hydrochlorici. 

Jc Acidi Hydrochlorici Dil., f3ij. vel f5iij.; Mellis Depurati, 
3J.; Decocti Hordei, Oij. Mix for the daily drink. 

" In typhus fever." — Dr. Tanner. 

The diluted Nitro-hydrochloric and Phosphoric Acids may in 
some cases replace the Hydrochloric Acid. 

Potus Potasses Bicarbonatis. 

5b Potassse Bicarb., 3ij.; P. Sacchari Alb., 5ij.; 01. Limonis, 
niij. M. ft. pulv.

Nutritious Demulcent Drinks. 

Mix together half a pint of Mucilago Acaciae, Mistura Amygdalae, 
and pure milk ; sweeten with sugar-candy or honey ; and add one large 
tablespoonful of any liqueur. Allow the whole to be taken during 
the day. Or a large pinch of isinglass may be boiled with a 
tumblerful of milk, half a dozen bruised almonds, and two or three 
lumps of sugar. To be taken warm once or twice in the day. 

These drinks are very grateful in cases of tonsillitis, ulceration of 
the pharynx, etc, also in some cases of debility with irritability of 
the stomach and a tendency to diarrhoea.

Part II.-EXTERNAL AND TOPICAL 
APPLICATIONS. 

This is a very important class of remedies, comprising a great 
variety of applications of undoubted value. Ointments and plaisters 
have fallen much into disuse of late years. They have been re- 
placed by many elegant and useful applications. Simple water 
dressing, or water medicated with Permanganate of Potash, 
(Condy's Fluid), Fluid Opium, the Chloride or Sulphate of Zinc, 
are all excellent dressings for granulating wounds, and give no 
trouble in their preparation.

82 LINIMENTA. 



LINIMENT A. 

The Liniments of the Pharmacopoeia are all very useful and 
excellent remedies, leaving nothing to be desired in that form of 
application. Those in use at the hospitals are inferior, the formulae 
being evidently framed with a view to economy. 

Linimentum Campliorse. 

9. Olive Oil, f^iv.; Camphor, §j. Dissolve. 

This is a useful Stock Liniment. It affords a ready means of 
quickly preparing the following : —

Linimentum lodi will be found amongst the Pigmenta; Lini- 
menta Aconiti, Belladonnas, Potassii lodidi c. Sapone, Saponis, 
and Sinapis Co., require special preparation, and should therefore 
be obtained from a house of repute ready made. 

Equal /ar^j of Olive Oil and Lime Water forms the Linimentum 
Calcis of the British Pharmacopoeia. 



PIGMENTA. 83 



PIGMENTA.

Mackenzie for general topical application to the larynx except in cases of 
tertiary syphilitic ulceration. . . . Even in the case of specific ulcers of the 
throat the solution of sulphate of copper is as efficacious as that of nitrate of 
silver, and far less frequently creates spasm or nausea.

CAUSTIC A. 



CAUSTICA. 

Causticum Argent. Nit. 

p. Nitrate Silver, I dram ; Spirits Nitric Ether, I oz. ; In-

Used for phlegmonous, vesiculous, and ulcerous affections. 

Causticum Arseniosum Co. 

Jb Arsenious Acid, I dram ; Vermilion, 2 scruples ; Calo- 
mel, 2.J grs. Skin. 
Used in ulcerous, strumous, and cachectic affections. 

^ Arsenious Acid, Powdered Acacia, of each i oz. ; Water 
5 fluid drams. 

Ur. Marsden speaks highly of this caustic in epithelioma. The 
affected part is to be painted over with it night and morning, taking 
care rigorously to limit the application to the diseased parts, and 
not to let it extend over more than one superficial inch at a time. 
As the part sloughs, its separation is to be aided by bread and water 
poultices ; and when all the disease has been got rid of by the 
repeated applications of the mucilage, a carrot poultice is to be 
applied during the night, and a weak black wash (Calomel 6o grs. 
to Lime Water, i pint) during the day, until the part is healed. 

Causticum Hydrargyri Perchloridi. 

9> Corrosive Sublimate, I dram ; Prepared Coloured Collo- 
dion, 6 drams. 

Useful in structural, tubercular, and ulcerous affections. 

Causticum. Sabinse Co. 

9> Powdered Savin, i dram; Burnt Alum, 15 grs.; Levi- 
gated Red Precipitate, 15 grs. Skin. 
Used in structural affections. 

Causticum Zinci Chloridi. 

P> Chloride Zinc and Oxide Zinc, equal parts. London 
Ophthalmic. 

5t> Powdered Bloodroot, \ oz. to I oz. ; Chloride Zinc, \ oz. 
to 2 oz. ; Water, 2 oz. ; Farina, sufficient to make a paste. 
Mix. 

The paste thus formed should have the consistence of treacle. 
This is the caustic which was employed by Dr. Fell. 



CAUSTIC A. 



Causticum Zinci Super siilph. 

5«> 4 fluid oz. of Sulphuric Acid, and saturate it with Sulphate 
Zinc, previously dried and powdered. 

Sir J. Y. Simpson recommends that this caustic should be used 
by dipping a pen in it, and then drawing lines across the tumour, 
so as to eat through the skin in a few minutes. The fissures thus 
made are to be filled with the paste, renewing the scratching and 
caustic every day or two. In this way five or eight days may suf- 
fice for the removal of a good-sized tumour. By this combination 
also we can penetrate deeply, without hardening the parts and 
without fear of producing haemorrhage. This is a veiy valuable 
caustic, and the author has found it particularly useful for the re- 
moval of cancerous tumours of the breast, etc. The pain which it 
produces will be best mitigated by employing the subcutaneous 
injection of morphia at each application. See Index of Diseases, 
Dr. Tanner, page 332. 

London Paste. 

( Throat Hospital.) 

P> Caustic Soda and Unslaked Lime of each equal parts. 

Reduce to a fine powder in a warm mortar, and mix intimately. 
Keep in well closed bottles, and when required for use take as much 
as is sufficient, and make into a paste with water. 

Recommended for destroying enlarged tonsils or the elongated 
uvula, where treatment with the guillotine or scissors is objected to. 

This preparation resembles the Vienna Paste, but is preferable in 
consequence of its being less liable to spread beyond the limits of 
application. Soda being used instead of potash, and water in place 
of alcohol, the preparation is much less painful.

Mr. Durham has devised a syringe for urethral injections which 
will at once commend itself to the judgment of the reader. The 
annexed drawing completely illustrates its action. 




The extremity (/) of the tube {e) is sunk in the fluid to be 
injected, and the syringe is filled. The tube {a) is then introduced, 
previously oiled, into the Urethra, until the bulb has passed beyond 
the point to which the inflammation extends. The hand-ball is 
then compressed, and the fluid issues through perforations made in 
such direction that it flows from backwards, as indicated in the 
figure. 

Thus a gentle stream fi-oin within outwards is maintained, and 
infectious matter is prevented from being carried on towards the 
bladder by the bulb of the instrument, which is grasped by the

charge, and astrmgent or soothing injections continuously applied.

Mercurial Vapour Baths. 

"The patient is seated on a chair, and covered with an oil-cloth 
lined with flannel, which is supported by a proper frame-work. 
Under the chair are placed a copper bath containing water, and a 
metallic plate on which is put from sixty to one hundred and eighty 
grains of the bisulphuret of mercuiy, or the same quantity of the 
grey oxide or the red oxide of this metal. In syphilitic affections of 
the skin, testes, and bones, from five to thirty grains of the green 
iodide of mercury may be employed ; or a mixture of twenty grains 
of the green iodide with ninety grains of the bisulphuret often proves 
efficacious. Under the bath and plate spirit lamps are lighted. The 
patient is thus exposed to the influence of three agents — heated air, 
steam, and the vapour of mercury. At the end of five to ten 
minutes perspiration commences, which becomes excessive in ten 
or fifteen minutes longer. The lamps are now to be extinguished, 
and when the patient has become moderately cool he is to be 



BALNEA. 



rubbed dry. He should then drink a cup of warm decoction of 
guaiacum or sarsaparilla, and repose for a short time. — LANdSTON 
Parker. In constitutional syphilis, when mercury is indicated. 
This method of introducing mercury into the system may also be 
adopted with benefit in other diseases, in place of administering the 
metal by the 7?iouth. 



The Turkish Bath. 

The general effect of a hot air bath is to increase the force and 
rapidity of the circulation, and to induce free perspiration ; but 
if too hot or too prolonged, the determination of blood to the 
skin and lungs becomes so great that the brain suffers. There is 
then, consequently, a lowering of the circulation, with depressed 
nervous power. A temperature varying from 120° to 165° will 
usually suffice ; while if the perspiration is efficient and continuous, 
and the sensation agreeable, the patient may remain in the cali- 
darium for from forty to sixty minutes. The bath is useful in 
removing local congestions, in clearing the pores, and in inducing a 
healthy condition of the skin and mucous membranes, in elimi- 
nating noxious matters from the blood, and in imparting a sense of 
elasticity and vigour to the system. It is injurious when there is 
any obstruction to the circulation, or when the heart or vessels are 
affected with fatty degeneration, or when there are symptoms of 
disease of the nervous centres, or when there is a tendency to vertigo 
or syncope, and in advanced life. Women who are pregnant, or 
■vvho are menstruating, ought not to have recourse to it. 



Cold Affusion. 

The patient is seated in an empty bath, and from four to six 
buckets of cold water (about 40° F.) are poured over his head and 
chest from a height of two or more feet. He is then quickly dried, 
and replaced in bed. The colder the water and the greater the 
height from which it is poured, the more stimulating the effect..' 
Affusion as thus practised by Dr. Currie proved very valuable in 
the treatment of typhus. It may be resorted to when the tempera- 
ture of the body is permanently above its normal (about 98° F.) 
standard, when there is no feeling of chilliness, when the body is 
not wholly bathed in sweat, when there is not much irritability of the 
nervous system, and when there is great stupor. The effect is to 
lower the temperature, to lessen the frequency of the pulse and 
respiration, to render the tongue moist and soft, to diminish or remove 
stupor, to procure sleep, and sometimes to produce a critical perspi- 
ration. It may be used every twenty-four hours if necessary. 



BALNEA. 



The Douche Bath. 

When it is desirable to apply this form of bath to one or more of 
the joints, it is only necessary to affix two or three yards of large sized 
india-rubber tubing to the tap of a cistern. The patient must sit in 
an empty bath into which the water may fall as it plays upon the 
limb. 

Wet Sheet Packing. 

The patient is closely enveloped in a sheet which has been dipped 
in -cold or tepid water and well wrung out. He is then carefully 
wrapped in a blanket, covered with three or four more blankets, 
and a down coverlet is tucked over all. He should remain thus for 
thirty, forty-five, or sixty minutes lying on his side, or in a semi-re- 
cumbent position ; the duration being timed by the sedative effect pro- 
duced. The sweating is not generally excessive ; but the water, urea, 
and chloride of sodium of the urine are slightly increased, this in- 
crease being considerable when the sheet is continued for four hours. 

The Blanket Bath. 

This affords an easy means of inducing sweating. A blanket is 
wrung out of hot water and wrapped round the patient. He is to 
be packed in three or four dry blankets, and allowed to repose for 
thirty minutes. The surface of the body should then be well rubbed 
with warm towels, and the patient made comfortable in bed. 

The Wet Compress. 

This consists merely of a roll of flannel or calico, dipped in cold 
water and wrung out, and then applied around the seat of pain. 
Over this a piece of waterproof cloth is to be worn. 

The Warm Bath as a Cooling Agent. 

The warm bath at a temperature of 95° F. must prove a cooling 
agent to the body of a fever patient at 100° to 105° F. The im- 
mersion should continue from fifteen minutes to an hour or longer. 
Its sedative effects render it valuable where the nervous system is 
irritable. 

In cases of delirium tremens with high fever, cold superfusion may 
be used while the patient is held in the warm bath. From ten to 
thirty buckets of cold water are to be poured slowly over the head ; 
hot water being continually added to the bath to maintain its heat 
at 95° F. This treatment generally produces sound sleep. 

Dr. Tanner. 



102 BALl^EA. 

Acid Sponging. 

One part of vinegar is to be added to two or three of cold water, 
and the body well sponged with the mixture. Simple tepid water 
may sometimes be advantageously used. The patient being weak 
and unable to move, the sponging must be done by degrees, i.e., 
the arms, chest, back, and legs are to be rapidly washed and dried. 
Useful in many cases of fever, inflammation, scarlatina, etc. 



ENEMATA. 

The dissolving power of the rectal fluids is very inferior to that of 
the stomach, and absorption also takes place more slowly. Thus 
medicines intended to produce a constitutional effect should 
be in solution. They require a longer time to affect the system 
than when given by the mouth. Food requires special pre- 
paration.

NUTRITIVE ENEMATA. 
Beef Tea and Brandy. 

Take six ounces of strong beef tea, an ounce of cream, and half 
an ounce of brandy or an ounce and a half of port w^ine. This may 
be administered twice or thrice in the course of twenty-four hours. 
In cases of acute gastritis, carcinoma of the stomach, obstinate 
vomiting, etc., where it is necessary to avoid giving food by the 
mouth. 

Opium, Iron, and Quinine. 

Take four or six ounces of restorative soup (F. 2), one ounce of 
cream, two teaspoonfuls of brandy, ten or fifteen minims of liquid 
extract of opium, and ten grains of citrate of iron and quinia. 

Cod Liver Oil and Bark. 

Take four ounces of essence of beef (F. 3), two ounces of port 
wine, an ounce of cod liver oil, two drachms of tincture of yellow 
cinchona, and twenty minims of liquid extract of opium. Mix. To 
be administered every twelve hours. 



104 ENEMA TA. 



Quinine and Beef. 

Take one tablespoonful of brandy, five grains of sulphate of 
quinine, one teaspoonful of glycerine, two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
and four to eight ounces of restorative soup, F. 2. Mix. This 
enema may be administered every six or eight hours. Where the 
rectum is very irritable, or it is necessary to relieve pain, from 
fifteen to twenty minims of the liquid extract of opium may be 
advantageously added. 

Feeding hy the Rectum. — It is sometimes of the greatest con- 
sequence to feed a patient in other ways than by the stomach ; and 
therefore the question of nourishing by the rectum is one of the 
gravest importance. The solvent influence of the rectal juices is 
practically nothing, and it is necessary to digest the food before 
injecting it into the rectum. This may be done in the following 
manner : — The pancreas of a bullock is to be finely chopped, freed 
from fat, and mixed with eight or nine ounces of glycerine ; a third 
part of this mixture, when about to be used, is added to five ounces 
of finely chopped meat and should be injected into the rectum as 
soon as it is made. 



VAPORES.— INHALATIONS. 

(From the Pharmcuopaia of the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat.) 

Inhalations as here prescribed are of five kinds : — 

1. Steam Inhalations; i.e., steam impregnated with volatile 
matter. Temperature, 130 F. to 150° F. 

2. Cold Inhalations. Temperature, 60° F. to 100° F. 

3. Dry Inhalations; i.e., volatile matters vaporized by heat. 

4. Atomised Inhalations ; i.e., inhalations of atomised fluids. 

5. Fuming Inhalations; i.e., inhalations of the smoke of 
ignited nitrated papers. 

(i.) Steam Inhalations. 

The value of steam inhalations has long been recognised both by 
the profession and the public. The curative effect of this class of 
remedies is, no doubt, in part due to the steam, but a special 
character is imparted to them by the particular medicament em- 
ployed in addition to the hot water. 

In the subjoined formulae, the quantities of ingredients are 
generally prescribed for three ounce mixtures, a teaspoonful of 



VAPORES.—TNHALA TIONS. 



105 



which is added to a pint of water at the required temperature, for 
each inhalation. Although formulae are given for each medi- 
cament, the quantity of the volatile oil may be increased according 
to the circumstances of the case, and it is often desirable to combine 
several oils or other remedies in the same prescription. In the case 
of most of the essential oils, light carbonate of magnesia is used to 
hold the oil in suspension, in the proportion of half a grain of 
magnesia to each drop of the oil. This medium is preferable to 
mucilage, glycerine, or spirit of wine. 




Electic Inhaler. Recommended by Dr. Morrel Mackenzie. 



(2.) Cold Inhalations. 

Cold inhalations are indicated when it is desirable to produce 
a general effect on the mucous membrane of the throat and where 
hot inhalations cause headache and faintness. The temperature 
jnay vary from 60° to 100° F. Cold inhalations are also useful in hot 
seasons and hot climates. Any of the forms recommended for cold 
inhalation can, if it be desired, be employed at a high temperature, 
but in that case it is generally necessary to slightly reduce their 
strength. For cold inhalations, the Eclectic Inhaler answers equally 
well as for steam inhalations.

VAPORES.—INHALA TIONS. 



(3.) Dry Inhalations. 

Dry hot inhalations are indicated in cases of excessive secretion, 
but are difficult of administration, as it is almost impossible to raise 
the temperature, in any small inhaler, to a sufficient degree, 
without a very complicated apparatus. By a slight adaptation of 
Messrs. Bullock & Reynold's Eclectic Inhaler, however, that 
apparatus may be conveniently employed. 

(4.) Atomised Inhalations. 

"Atomised Medicated Fluids may be advantageously used in 
affections of the lining membrane of the nose, mouth, and fauces, in 
Croup and Diphtheria, Syphilitic affections of palate and throat, 
Laryngitis, CEdema of the Glottis, Hooping Cough, Bronchitis, 
Phthisis, Hoarseness, and Loss of Voice. During the application, 
the parties should make deep and long inspirations and expirations. 
Except in acute cases one application daily will suffice." — Tanner's 
Index of Diseases, p. 341. 

The following are the principal remedies used as Atomised 
Inhalations : —

inhalation of atomised fluids is acknowledged to be a rational 
and successful method of treating various affections of the nose, 
throat, air passages, and Ivmgs. By its means the indicated 
remedy is applied directly to the diseased tissues, and is, in these 
cases, what washes and lotions are to the exposed surfaces when 
diseased or mechanically injured. Inhalation may in this manner

the effect of dissolving the membranous exudation.

supplement constitutional treatment by the ordinary means, and it 
will be found a valuable auxiliary. Biegel's Practical Treatise "On 
Inhalation as a means of Local Treatment, etc.," will supply the 
reader with very complete information on the subject. 

Siegle's apparatus acts exceedingly well, the spray is warm, and 
so fine that it causes little or no irritation on the most sensitive 
surface ; it is self-acting and neither fatigues the patient nor 
requires an assistant. Moreover, it is handy, durable, portable, 
and its cheapness brings it within the reach of all classes. 




(5.) Fuming Inhalations. 

These inhalations are derived from smoke arising from the 
ignition of unsized paper steeped in a solution of nitrate of potash. 
Though the value of fuming inhalations has long been recognised 
both by physicians and patients, the remedy has not hitherto been 



io8 VAPORES.— INHALATIONS. 

placed on a scientific basis. This is now done by requiring the 
papers to be steeped in solutions of definite strength, and by modify- 
ing their effects by the addition of various volatile principles. 

This form of inhalation is recommended in cases of spasmodic 
dyspnoea, especially when dependent on asthmatic complications or 
on spasm of the adductors of the vocal cords. The method of using 
the papers is as follows : — a strip is lit at one end and dropped into 
a cylindrical vessel about four inches high and of a diameter of two 
inches. A wire gauze cover is then put on, and the fumes are 
inhaled by repeated deep inspirations. 

Vapor Acidi Acetici. 

9= Acetic Acid, Glacial Acetic Acid, ot each, f Jjss. Mix.

P> Carbolic Acid, 3xxj.; Water, fjiij. 

For steam inhalation use as above. For cold inhalation, two 
teaspoonfuls in a pint of water at 80° F. to 100° F.

ulcerations. 



Vapor Acidi Hydrocyanici. 

P) Acid Hydrocyanic Dilute, B.P., f5iij. ; Water, adf ^iij.

The temperature of this inhalation may vary from 60° to 100° F. 

Stimulant. The value ot this remedy has been much overesti- 
mated both by the public and the profession. It is apt to cause 
spasmodic irritation of the air tubes. It should be inhaled VERY 
SLOWLY.

HYPODERMIC INJECTIONS. 



HYPODERMIC INJECTIONS.* 
Injection of Aconitine. 

9, Aconitine, gr. j. ; Sp. Vini Rect., nx. ; Aquae Dest., ad 
fjij. Mix. 

For the first injection not more than two minims should be 
employed. The dose may afterwards be safely increased to four 
minims (j^ gr.). It is better, though not absolutely necessary, to 
make the injection at the seat of pain. 

Injection of Atr opine. t 

The subcutaneous injection of Atropine is sometimes useful in 
cases of intestinal obstruction, asthma, tetanus, neuralgia, chorea in 
the adult, etc. Great caution is necessary. Not more than two 
minims of the officinal Liquor Atropia = jV gr. should be employed 
at first. 

Injection of Morphia, B.P., 1874. t 

A solution of Acetate of Morphia, containing i grain of the 
Acetate in 12 minims of the injection. For first injections not more 
than three minims should be used, as it is certain that this narcotic 
acts more powerfully when thus employed than when taken into the 
stomach. In diseases which are continuously painful, the ease given 
by an injection will last for about twelve hours. To relieve the 
suffering of advanced cancer, etc., the injection may be advantage- 
ously given night and morning for many months. 

Injection of Chloroform. 

An injection of ten or fifteen minims often effects a cure for the 
time in pleurodynia, neuralgia, sciatica, etc. It has the disadvan- 
tage of sometimes producmg an irritable ulcer, which may be slow 
in healing. — Tanner's "Index of Diseases." 



* It may for convenience be stated in this place that the primary dose of a salt 
of Morphia should never exceed one eighth, of Atropine one sixtieth, of Strychnia 
one twenty-fourth, of Aconitine one thirtieth, of a grain, and of Quinine one or 
two grains. — Dr. Stille. 

t Atropine and Morphia combined may be used in neuralgic pains about the eye. 



Part III -ALIMENTS, ETC. 



ALIMENTS.* 
(i.) Extract of Beef. 

Take one pound of rump steak, mince it like sausage meat, and 
mix it with one pint of cold water. Place it in a pot at the side of 
the fire, to heat very slowly. It may stand two or three hours 
before it is allowed to simmer, and then let it boil gently for fifteen 
minutes. Skim and serve. The addition of a small teaspoonful of 
cream to a teacupful of this beef renders it richer and moi*e 
nourishing. Sometimes it is preferred when thickened with a little 
flour or arrowroot. 

(2.) Restorative Soup for Invalids. 

Take one pound of newly-killed beef or fowl, chop fine, add 
eight fluid ounces of soft or distilled water, four or six drops of pure 
hydrochloric acid, thirty to sixty grains of common salt, and stir 
well together. After three hours the whole is to be thrown on a 
conical hair sieve, and the fluid allov/ed to pass through with slight 
pressure. On the fresh residue in the sieve, pour slowly two ounces 
of distilled water, and let it run through while squeezing the meat. 
There is thus obtained about ten fluid ounces of cold juice (cold 
extract of flesh of red colour), possessing a pleasant taste of 
soup ; of which a wineglassful may be taken at pleasure. It must 
not be warmed, at least not to a greater extent than can be effected 
by standing in hot water a bottle partially filled with the juice, since 
it is rendered muddy by heat or by alcohol, and deposits a thick 
coagulum of albumen with the colouring matter of blood. If from 
any special circumstances (such as a free secretion of gastric juice), 
it is deemed undesirable to administer an acid, the soup may be 
well prepared by merely soaking the mincemeat in plain distilled 
water. Children will frequently take the raw meat simply minced, 
when they are suffering from great debility. One tea-spoonful of 
such meat may be given every three hours. 

* For many excellent receipts the reader is referred to the work of Miss Acton, 
Crefyeld's Family Fare, and Dr. Tanner's Index of Diseases, from which some 
of the formulae have been taken. 

I 



ri4 ALIMENTS. 



This modification of Liebig's formula is very valuable in cases 
of continued fever, in dysentery, and indeed in all diseases attended 
with great prostration and weakness of the digestive organs. 
When the flavour is thought disagreeable, it may be concealed by 
the addition of spice, or of a wineglassful of claret to each teacup 
of soup. 

(3.) Essence of Beef.* 

Take one pound of gravy beef, free from skin and fat, chop it 
up as fine as mincemeat, and pound it in a mortar with two table- 
spoonfuls of soft water. Then put it into a covered earthen jar 
with a little salt, cementing the ridges of the cover with pudding or 
paste. Place the jar in an oven, or tie it tightly in a cloth, and 
plunge it into a pot of boiling water for three hours. Strain off 
(through a coarse sieve so as to allow the smaller particles of meat to 
pass) the liquid essence, which will amount to about two ounces in 
quantity. Give two or more teaspoonfuls frequently. 

In great debility, diphtheria, exhaustion from haemorrhage, etc. 

(4) Brandy and Egg Mixture. 

Take the white and yolks of three eggs, and beat them up in four 
ounces of plain water, add slowly three or four ounces of brandy, 
with a little sugar and nutmeg. This form is preferable to that in 
"London Pharmacopoeia," for 1851. 

Two tablespoonfuls should be given every four or six hours. In 
some cases of great prostration the efficacy of the mixture is much 
increased by the addition of one drachm of the tincture of yellow 
cinchona to each dose. 

(5.) A Special Restorative. 

Dr. Dobell. 

New milk, 4 parts ; beef tea, cold, 2 parts ; pale brandy, i part. 

If no other food is taken, about five ounces (half an ordinary 
tumblerful) should be given every two hours, or half that quantity 
every hour. When desirable this food may be gradually thickened 
by the addition of boiled com flour or other farinaceous articles, and 
flavoured with spice. 

(6.) Stewed Oysters. 

Half a pint of oysters, half an ounce of butter, flour, one third of 
a pint of cream, cayenne and salt to taste. Scald the oysters in 
their own liquor, take them out, beard them, and strain the liquor. 
Put the butter into a stewpan, dredge in sufficient flour to dry it up, 

* Dr. Leared has suggested an admirable apparatus for making bee tea. 
Messrs. Maw Son & Thompson are the mikers. 



ALIMENTS. Tis 



add the oyster liquor and stir it over a sharp fire with a wooden 
spoon ; when it comes to a boil add the cream, oysters, and season- 
ing ; let all simmer for one or two minutes, but 7tot longer, or the 
oysters will harden ; serve on a hot dish, with croutons or toasted 
sippets of bread. A quarter of a pint of oysters, the other ingredi- 
ents in proportion, make a dish large enough for one person. 

(7.) Panada. 

Take the crumb of a penny roll, and soak it in milk for half an 
hour, then squeeze the milk from it ; have ready an equal quantity of 
chicken or veal scooped very fine with a knife ; pound the bread 
crumbs and meat together in a mortar. It may be cooked either 
mixed with veal or chicken broth, or by taking it up in two tea- 
spoons in pieces the shape of an egg after seasoning it, poached like 
an egg, and served on mashed potato. 

(8.) Macaroni. 

Two ounces of macaroni, a quarter of a pint of milk, a quarter of 
pint of good beef gravy, the yolk of one egg, two tablespoonfuls of 
cream, half an ounce of butter. Wash the macaroni, and boil it 
in the gravy and milk till quite tender. Drain it, put the macaroni 
into a very hot dish, and put by the fire. Beat the yolk of the egg 
with the cream and two tablespoonfuls of the liquor the macaroni 
was boiled in. Make this sufficiently hot to thicken, but do not 
allow it to boil, or it will be spoiled : pour it over the macaroni, and 
grate over the whole a little finely grated Parmesan cheese ; or the 
macaroni may be served as an accompaniment to minced beef, 
without the cheese ; or it may be taken alone with some good gravy 
in a tureen, served with it. 

(9.) Stewed Eel. 

One eel, half a pint of strong stock, two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
half a glass of port wine, thickening of flour, a little cayenne. Wash 
and skin the eel, cut it in pieces about two inches long, pepper and 
salt them and lay them in a stewpan, pour over the stock, and add the 
wine ; stew gently for twenty-five minutes or half an hour, lift the 
pieces carefully on a very hot dish and place it by the fire ; di-ain the 
gravy, stir into the cream sufficient- flour to thicken it, mix with the 
gravy, boil for two minutes and add a little cayenne, pour over the 
eel, and serve. 

(10). Custard Pudding. 

Half a pint of milk, or a little more, two eggs. Warm the milk, 
whisk the eggs, yolk and white, pour the milk to them, stirring all 
the while. Butter a small basin that will exactly hold it, put in the 



Ii6 ALIMENTS. 



custard, and tie a floured cloth over it, plunge into boiling water, 
turn it about for a few minutes. Boil it slowly for half an hour, 
turn it out and serve. 

(ii.) Baked Custard. 

Half a pint of milk or a little more, two eggs. Warm the milk, 
whisk the eggs, yolk and white, pour the milk to them, stirring all 
the while, have ready a small tart dish lined at the edges with paste 
ready baked, pour the custard into the dish, grate a little nutmeg 
over the top, and bake in a very slow oven for half an hour. 

(i2.) Essence of Beef. 

One pound of lean beef cut from the sirloin or rump, half-pint of 
cold water. Cut up the meat in small pieces, and place it in a 
covered saucepan by the side of the fire for four or five hours, then 
allow it to simmer gently for two hours, skim it well, and serve. 

(13.) Mutton Jelly. 

Six shanks of mutton, one and half quarts of water, pepper and 
salt to taste, half a pound of lean beef, a crust of bread toasted 
brown. Soak the shanks in water several hours, and scrub them 
well, put them and the beef and other ingredients into a saucepan 
with the water, and let them simmer very gently for five hours. 
Strain it, and when cold take off the fat ; warm up as much as 
required when wanted. 

(14.) Nourishing Soup. 

Wash two ounces of best pearl sago well, then stew the sago in a 
pint of water till it is quite tender and very thick. Mix it with half 
a pint of good boiling cream and the yolks "of two fresh eggs, mix 
the whole carefully with one quart of essence of beef, F. 12. The 
essence must be heated separately, and mixed while both mixtures 
are hot. A little of this may be warmed up at a time for use. 

(15.) Mutton Broth. 

One pound of the scrag end of neck of mutton, two pints of water, 
pepper and salt, half-pound of potatoes or some pearl barley. Put 
the mutton into a stewpan, pour over it the water, pepper and salt ; 
when it boils skim it carefully, cover the pan, and let it simmer 
gently for an hour. Strain it, let it get cold, and then remove all 
the fat. When required for use add some pearl barley or potatoes 
in the following manner : — Boil the potatoes, mash them smoothly, 
see that no lumps remain, put the potatoes into a pan, and gradually 
add the mutton broth, stirring it till it is well mixed and smooth, 
let it simmer for five minutes and serve with fried bread. 



ALIMENTS. 117 



(16.) Calf s-foot Broth. 

One calf 's-foot, three pints of water, one small lump of sugar, the 
yolk of one egg ; stew the foot in water very gently till the liquor is 
reduced to half, remove the scum, set it in a basin till quite cold, 
and then take off every particle of fat. Warm up about half a pint, 
adding the butter and sugar, take it off the fire for a minute or two, 
then add the beaten yolk of the egg ; keep stirring it over the fire 
till the mixture thickens, but do not let it boil or it will be spoiled. 

(17.) Rabbit Soup. 

Take a rabbit and soak it in warm water ; when quite clean cut it 
in pieces and put it into a stewpan, and a teacupful of veal stock 
or broth, simmer slowly till done through, and then add one quart 
of water, and boil for an hour ; take out the rabbit, pick the meat 
from the bones, covering it up to keep it white, put the bones back 
into the liquor and simmer two hours. Skim and strain and let it 
cool. Pound up the meat in a mortar with the yolks of two hard 
boiled eggs and the crumbs of a fresh roll previously soaked in 
milk; rub it through a tammy, and gradually add the strained 
liquor, and simmer for fifteen minutes. If liked thick, mix some 
arrowroot with half a pint of new milk, bring it to a boil, mix with 
the soup and serve. If preferred thin have ready some pearl- 
barley and vermicelli boiled in milk and add to the soup instead of 
the arrowroot. Serve with little squares of toast or fried bread. 

(18.) Veal Soup. 

Take a knuckle of veal, two cow heels, twelve peppercorns, one 
glass of sherry, two quarts of water. Put all these ingredients into 
an earthen jar, and stew six hours. Do not open it till cold. 
When wanted for use, skim off the fat and strain it ; place on the 
fire as much as you require for use. Serve very hot. 

(19.) Port Wine Jelly. 

Take of port wine, i pint ; isinglass, i oz. ; sugar, i oz. ; put the 
isinglass and sugar into \ pint of water ; warm till all is dissolved, 
then add the wine, strain through muslin, and set to jelly. An 
excellent way of giving port wine. 

(20.) Milk, with Rum, Whisky, or Brandy. 

Put one tablespoonful of rum, brandy, or whisky, into half a pint 
of new milk, and mix well by pouring several times from one vessel 
to another. "Bilious" persons should heat the rum before adding 
it to the milk. — Dr. Dobell. 



Ii8 DIET TABLES. 



DIET TABLES. 

In the treatment of disease the r^iilation of the diet always 
demands particular attention ; it may be made a powerful agent in 
the restoration of health, while negligence or errors are often exceed- 
ingly disastrous. The writer has seen cases lost which, humanly 
speaking, might have been saved had the nutrition of the patient 
been properly regarded ; in other words if he had had food in the 
proportion that his malady had medicine. It is quite beyond the 
scope of this little work to go into the principles which should 
govern the selection of food in disease. The utmost that our 
space will allow we have attempted. The reader will find the 
following tables assist him materially in determining a suitable 
diet for most cases.

SPECIAL DIETS, ETC. 



DIETETIC TREATMENT OF SPASMODIC ASTHMA. 

The diet must be regularly weighed out, and adhered to with the 
greatest strictness, the hours of meals being most rigidly fixed as 
follows : — 

Breakfast at 8 a.m. — To consist of half a pint of green tea or 
coffee, with a little cream, and two ounces of dry, stale bread. 

Dinner at I p.m. — To consist of two ounces of fresh beef or 
mutton, without fat or skin, and two ounces of dry stale bread or 
well-boiled rice ; three hours after dinner (not sooner) half a pint of 



126 SPECIAL DIETS. 



weak brandy and water, or whiskey and water, or dry sherry and 
water, may be taken, or toast and water ad libitum. 

Supper at ^ p.m. — To consist of two ounces of meat as before, 
with two ounces of dry stale bread. 

The patient is not to be allowed to drink any fluid whatever 
within one hour before his dinner or supper, and not until three 
hours after either of these meals. At other times he is not limited 
as to drinks, otherwise than that all malt liquors are to be prohibited. 
Soda or Seltzer water may be indulged in at other times when 
thirsty. 

With this dietetic treatment sedatives are to be given as follows : — 

Three grains of the Extract of Conium are to be taken four times 
a-day ; namely, at the hours of seven, twelve, five, and ten, the 
dose to be gradually increased to five grains four times a-day. To 
each of these pills a fourth of a grain of the Extract of Indian 
Hemp may be added, which may be gradually increased to one 
grain in each dose. 

Mr. Pridham, Brit. Med. jfournal, June 9 to Dec. 29, i860. 



DIETETIC TREATMENT OF APOPLEXY. 

The diet of the patient should be low, till all apprehension of a 
relapse is passed, and limited to milk, boiled vegetables, light 
.puddings, and fish. At no subsequent period ought he to indulge in 
a full animal diet, or to drink undiluted wines. At the same time, 
too lowering a regimen is to be avoided, as thereby the irritability 
of the system and the heart's action generally is increased. All the 
causes of the disease already fully referred to should be avoided, 
counteracted, or overcome.

DIETETIC TREATMENT IN EPILEPSY. 

In the adult the diet should be light, and the patient should live 
temperately. He should live dy rule. He should rise early and 
take regular exercise in the open air, keeping his head cool and his 
feet warm. The diet of an infant so affected should be, if possible, 
its mother's milk, with or without arrowroot. If above three or 
four years of age, its diet should consist entirely of farinaceous or of 
other light vegetable food. 

Dr. AlTKEN, ^"^ Scmtce and Practice of Medicine" 
vol. ii., page 543. 



REGIMEN AND DIET IN LOSS OF NERVE POWER, ETC. 

Regimen and Diet in Loss of Nerve Power, etc., always 
of importance in the treatment of every case, is especially so in 
those diseases in which Phosphorus or its combinations are 
indicated. 

Attention should, in the first place, be directed to the general 
health of the patient, condition of the digestive organs, and state 
of the bowels ; where these are disordered suitable correctives should 
be prescribed before commencing as well as during the course of 



128 SPECIAL DIETS. 



Phosphonis. Constipation, so frequently persistently present, is to be 
relieved ; and where there is torpidity of liver, mild mercurials, when 
not contra-indicated, or podophyllin in alterative doses, should be 
administered, combined with gentle aperients. The following num- 
bers, 63, 65, 119, 141, 163, are suggested as being well adapted to 
these purposes. They will effectually prevent the clogging of the 
liver of which some writers speak. 

It is to be borne in mind that Phosphorus partakes rather of the 
nature of food than of medicine ; its office is to supply nutrition of a 
special character, and its operation is promoted by a judicious, and 
delayed, if not destroyed, by an injudicious management; it is 
important therefore that the patient should submit to a prescribed 
regimen, enjoining abstinence from, or extreme moderation in, the 
use of alcoholic drinks and tobacco, the avoidance of over- 
feeding, mental fatigue, strong muscular exercise, and excesses 
of every kind, that directly or indirectly fatigue, not to say 
exhaust, the forces and waste the tissues which the phosphorus 
is administered to support and nourish. The adoption of early 
hours and the daily use of the bath (cold or tepid, according 
to the condition of the patient; the cold bath, either plunge, 
douche, or sponge, always to be preferred when admissible), 
and exercise in the open air, are all absolutely necessary. The 
Turkish Bath is a valuable help in the treatment of many disorders, 
and it may always be safely employed where there is no reason to 
suspect organic lesion. It is especially useful in nervous exhaustion 
from overwork. I know of no remedy which so quickly relieves 
brain fatigue. The diet must be simple and nutritious, and good of 
its kind ; fresh meat, mutton or beef, plainly dressed and not over- 
cooked, fish and fresh vegetables. Eggs, recently laid, uncooked, 
are at once easy of digestion and highly nutritious, in some cases as 
many as half a dozen may be taken in twenty -four hours. In cases 
where wine is advisable Burgundy is to be preferred ; tea and coffee, 
unless they be very moderately taken, had better be altogether 
avoided. The kind, as well as the quantity, of the food must how- 
ever be determined by the digestive power of the patient, and this 
is found to be frequently so impaired as only to admit of milk and 
and easily assimilated farinaceous substances, such as lentil meal, 
corn flour, macaroni, etc. 

So important is the determination of the diet in the treatment of 
nervous disease — often dependent more or less entirely upon de- 
fective nutrition — that it should in every case be made the subject of 
a special prescription, in which the kind and quantity of the food 
should be definitively stated for the guidance of the patient. 



SPECIAL DIETS. 129 



DIET FOR DIABETES. 

The important principle to be regarded is the exclusion of starch 
and sugar, and articles containing them ; all else is of little con- 
sequence. Meat, poultry, fish, game, green vegetables, cress, 
celery, lettuce, spinach, and the like ; butter, cheese, eggs, are 
all admissible. Van Abbott's and Banthoron's gluten bread and 
biscuits, and Blatchley's bran biscuits are all very valuable substitutes 
for wheaten bread. 

Pepsine, Pancreatine, and Dilute Hydrochloric Acid, are very 
useful di^estants in diabetes. 

Dr. Pavy says diabetic patients 

May drink — 
Dry Sherry, Claret, Sauterne, Soda Water, Burton Bitter Beer. 

Must NOT drink — 
Milk (except sparingly), Sweet Ales, Porter, Stout, Cider, Sparkling 
Wines.

Heim's Pills. 

9= Pulv. Digitalis, gr. x. ; Pulv. Ipecac. , gr. v. ; Pulv. Opii, 
gr. V. ; Ext. Helenii, q.s. ft. pil. xx. 

Dose — One pill three times a day. 

Use — As an antipyretic in phthisis these pills give excellent 
results. Fever being a most active source of exhaustion, remedies 
which have the power of controlling it, lessening its intensity and 
duration, are exceedingly valuable. Dr. Niemeyer, in his Practical 
Medicine, speaks highly of this combination and the following. 

Heim's Pills with Quinine. 

P) Quiniae Sulph., gr.- xx.; Pulv. Digitalis, gr. x. ; Pulv. 
Ipecac, gr. v.; Pulv. Opii, gr. v.; Ext. Helenii, q.s. ft. 
pil. XX. 

Dose — One three times a day. 

Digitalis and Quinine have a well-merited reputation as a means 
of arresting abnormal calorification and reducing animal heat. 
This preparation is especially appropriate in cases of phthisis, when 
fever of a periodic type, marked by chills and evening exacerbations, 
is present. The effect of these pills, like other preparations con- 
taining Digitalis, should be watched. They may be suspended 
when a distinct reduction of temperature, and the frequency of 
the pulse is apparent, and resumed as occasion may require. 

Dr. Martini's Anti -Hysterical Pills. 

9) Auri et Sodii Chloridi, gr. v. ; Pulv. Tragacanth et Sacchari, 
q.s. ft. pil. xl. 

Dose — One pill to be taken an hour after dinner and supper. 
Afterwards two pills at these hours, and gradually increase the dose 
up to eight pills daily. 

This remedy is mentioned also by Dr. Niemeyer as a nervine of 
great efficacy in hysteria, and he has used it witii signal effect in 
many cases in which there was no indication for the local treatment 
of uterine affections.

Ricord's Pills. 

p. Hydrargri Protoiodidi, Lactucarii, aa 5jss- '■> Ext. Opii 
Aquosoe, gr. ix. ; Ext. Guaiaci Aquosae, 5j- Ft. pil, xxxvj. 

Dose — One twice or thrice a day. 

Use — In constitutional syphilis. 

These pills are found to produce in many subjects severe pain in 
the bowels. Thisi however, is more the fault of the dose, which is 
excessive, than the remedy, which is found to give excellent results 
in smaller doses. Formula 14 is a safer preparation and rarely 
disagrees. 

Blaud's Pills. 

$b Ferri Sulph. Pur., Potassae Carb. Pur., aa 5ss. ; Pulv. 
Tragacanth, q.s. ft. pil. xcvj. 

(The original recipe orders 48). 

Use — Said to be a specific in chlorosis. 

"For twenty years," says Dr. Niemeyer, "I have used Blaiui's 
pills in chlorosis, and have witnessed such brilliant results that I 
have found no opportunity to experiment with any other prepara- 
tion." 

Dose — Three pills, increased to four or five if well borne, thrice 
daily. 

Croton Choral Pills. 

9> Croton Chloral, gr. xxiv. ; Pulv. Tragacanth, gr. vj.; Ext. 
Gentianse, q.s. ft. pil. xij.=gr. ij. in each pill. 

A new remedy, for which we are indebted to Liebreich. Em- 
ployed to produce anaesthesia of the fifth nerve, it has been found 
exceedingly useful in trigeminal neuralgia. Sometimes employed as 
a soporific, in doses of five to ten grains. Dr. Yeo recommends it 
in irritative night cough in phthisis, in acute neuralgia, in doses of 
from 2 to 5 grains every hour or the smaller dose every half hour 
until 15 grs. have been taken. 

Dose — From i to 3 pills. 

For full description of this remedy see an excellent article by Dr. 
Yeo in i}a& Lancet, July 31^/, 1874. 

Sulphide Calcium Pills. 

P> Calcii Sulph., gr. ij.; Pulv. Tragacanth et Ext. Gentianre, 
q.s. ft. pil. XX. 

Dose — One pill eyery two or three hours. 



APPENDIX. 151 



Use — -"The sulphides appear often to arrest suppuration. In in- 
flammation threatening to end in suppuration they reduce the inflam- 
mation and avert the formation of pus. In boils and carbuncles 
they yield excellent results. A tenth of a grain of Sulphide of 
Calcium given every two or three hours, generally prevents the 
formation of fresh boils, while it lessens the inflammation and 
reduces the area of the existing boils and quickly liquefies the core, 
so that its separation is much more speedy, thus considerably 
curtailing the course of the boil." — Ringer's Therapeutics. 

See the Lancet, Feb. 21, 1874. 

Cinchonine Pills. 

Ijb Cinchoninas Hydrochlor., gr. xxlv. ; Pulv. Capsici, gr. iv. ; 
Ext. Gentianae, q.s. ft. pil. xij. 

Dose — One to two pills once or twice daily. 

It is a matter of clinical experience that Capsicum increases the 
action of the Cinchona Alkaloids. It certainly aids their rapid diffu- 
sion when given in a pilular form. The present high price of Quinine 
gives the (Jinchonines additional value as its substitute, and they 
certainly deserve to be more largely employed. " A commission 
having in 1866 been appointed in the Madras Presidency to 
examine the antiperiodic powers of Cinchonine, Cinchonidine 
and Quinidine, supplies of these alkaloids were placed at the 
disposal of medical officers at ' noted malarious stations, ' and were 
tested by 1145 cases of paroxysmal fevers of all types. * * * 
The main conclusion which the members of the commission have 
derived from the data before them is, ' that these alkaloids, hitherto 
little valued in medicine, are scarcely, if at all, inferior as thera- 
peutical agents to Quinine.' As a general rule it appears that those 
experiments were the most successful in which medium doses (gr. ij. 
to gr. V.) were administered in a single dose daily, the cases 
recovering more expeditiously than when larger or smaller quantities 
were employed." — Pharmacopma of India, 1868. 

For combination with Iron and Nux Vomica see'F. 173. 

Bromide Mercury Pills. 

(Hospital for Women.') 

|b Hydrargyri Bromidi, gi". vj. ; Confect. Rosre, q. s. ft. pil. xij. 

Dose — One or two pills. 

This must not be confounded with the Bibromide of Mercury, a 
preparation stated to be analogous in its action to Corrosive 
Sublimate. 



152 APPENDIX. 



Aconite Granules. 

The virtues of Aconite are daily becoming more appreciated. 
That it is a remedy of very great value is acknowledged by all 
therapeutists, and a convenient mode of administering it accurately 
in small doses is a desideratum. The officinal extract (prepared 
from the leaves) gives very uncertain results, a disadvantage which is 
not noticed when prepared from the root by alcoholic exhaustion. 
It is found that this alcoholic extract, when finely divided with sugai^ 
of milk, and made into granules, is very uniform in its operation. 

See note, page 66. 

Oxalate of Cerium Pills. 

$t Cerii Oxalatis, gr. xxiv. ; Sacchari Lactis, gr. xij. ; Ext. 
Glycyrrhizas, q.s. ft. pil. xij. 
Uses — In irritable dyspepsia, attended with gastrodynia, pyrosis, 
vomiting, especially the vomiting of pregnancy. In chorea, epilepsy, 
and other allied convulsive affections. 

Dose — One or two pills. Often found to succeed in cases where 
Nitrate of Silver and Bismuth have failed. 

Black Snake Root Pills. 

p. Ext. Acteffi Racemosse Alcoholic, gr. xxxvj, ; Pulv. 
Tragacanth et Glycyrrhizse, q.s. ft. pil. xij. 

This medicine is highly esteemed in America, and the root from 
which it is prepared, although not officinal, has been used in 
England. 

Its properties are said to be alterative, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, 
expectorant, resolvent, emmenagogue, parturient, etc. 

Dose — One pill three times a day. 

This remedy was thought well of by Dr. James Simpson, of 
Edinburgh, and Dr. Neligan thinks it deserves trial. 

Iridin or Irisin Pills (derived from Iris Versicolor). 

^o Iridin, gr. xij.; Sacchari Lactis, gr. xij.; Ext. Glycyrrhizse, 
q.s. ft. pil. xij. 
Uses — In scrofula, syphilis, gonorrJura, dropsy, rheumatism, glan- 
dular swelling, eruptions of skin, and affections of liver or spleen. 
Dose — One or two pills three times a day. 

" Irisin is justly," says Dr. Glover Coe, " esteemed as one of our 
most valuable remedies. It is eminently resolvent, and exercises a 
marked influence over the whole glandular system, quickening the 
activity of the secreting apparatus, and promoting depuration. "
